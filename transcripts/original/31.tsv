0	17560	Prominence Rhode Island, how are y'all doing tonight?
17560	23560	Here we are immersed in what can only be called an extinct bank vault, this is fantastic.
24560	27560	A comedy club, it looks like a prison and a bank.
27560	30560	Harmon Town is now in Session, Rhode Island.
34560	38560	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan Harmon.
53560	56560	Rhode Island.
56560	58560	Did you want more music?
58560	61560	No, no, no, no. That was the end of the song.
61560	63560	Rhode Island.
63560	67560	Some facts about Rhode Island, Jeff.
67560	70560	You just told me you didn't Wikipedia them.
70560	72560	The typewriter was invented here?
72560	74560	That's not true.
74560	78560	It is the smallest state per capita.
83560	88560	It is only 175 yards across.
88560	102560	It is between the lower curve of the Tangiers River and the Colorado Peninsula.
102560	107560	And it's the most haunted state.
107560	110560	Are there any famous ghosts?
110560	113560	There are several famous ghosts.
113560	121560	King Tut is rumored to haunt the Biltmore, which is just down the street.
121560	128560	Charles Dickens apparently roams the old First Street promenade.
128560	134560	Still warning children about the events of Halloween 1912.
134560	143560	And also Connecticut haunts Rhode Island.
143560	145560	Why is that?
145560	147560	Just jealousy.
147560	151560	Ever since Rhode Island was invented, Connecticut became yesterday's news
151560	158560	and suffered a sort of public relations death that it felt unjustified in.
158560	163560	If you still listen very quietly, you can still hear Connecticut weeping
163560	167560	in the winds of the Rhode Island expressway.
167560	169560	I didn't do any research.
169560	173560	I figured it was a small state we could get away with one night of just hanging out.
173560	178560	A lot of you probably came here because we begged you two at the Boston show.
178560	182560	And still others of you who weren't begged probably.
182560	184560	Rhode Island is like 30 feet across.
184560	188560	What are the odds that anyone is actually from within the boundaries of the state?
188560	191560	Who do we have here that's actually a Rhode Islander?
191560	195560	Don't raise your hand.
195560	199560	Actually a shit ton of people.
199560	201560	The entire population of Rhode Island.
201560	203560	How big is Rhode Island?
203560	209560	What's the actual 35 by 40 miles?
209560	212560	I would have no idea if that was a joke or not.
212560	215560	You could tell me 350 miles.
215560	217560	I don't have any sense of the scale.
217560	222560	I know that when you look on the internet, it's one of the few states in the US
222560	226560	where they have to have that little magnifying glass thing come up.
226560	229560	They can't just put the red dot on it.
229560	233560	It has to have a little inset where they're like, it's over here.
233560	236560	I think that's nothing to be ashamed of.
236560	238560	I don't know what having a big state gets you.
238560	241560	I think that's stupid.
241560	244560	It kind of defeats the purpose of being a state.
244560	246560	How are you supposed to make all those people happy?
246560	247560	What kind of laws are you going to pass?
247560	251560	If you pass a law in Rhode Island, you know that it's firmly set.
251560	255560	It's like only a couple people said this.
255560	257560	No. No smoking.
257560	263560	For real. Me, Carl, and Dave said so.
263560	266560	Now there's a reason, Dan, that I didn't Wikipedia Rhode Island today
266560	268560	because he was very busy.
268560	272560	Oh yeah, I turned in my CBS script today.
272560	277560	I've been kind of...
277560	280560	You've probably sensed in the previous tour episodes
280560	282560	that I've been a little preoccupied.
282560	285560	I wasn't really letting my hair down that much.
285560	288560	It was because I had something, you know, I had that on my mind.
288560	293560	And now I'm done. Now I'm free, clear.
293560	296560	You've got like 48 hours to write a whole other script, don't you?
296560	299560	Yeah, yeah, for Fox, yeah.
299560	302560	But that's, you know, that's going to be the next community.
302560	305560	That's not going to be a problem. That's fine.
305560	306560	That's going to come easy.
306560	308560	This CBS thing was like rolling a brick up a hill
308560	314560	because it's like, Jesus Christ, why is everything double spaced?
314560	316560	That's how they like it. They like it double spaced.
316560	320560	They like more cameras and more pages over there.
320560	321560	It's not easy.
321560	322560	And you have to write in...
322560	323560	Did you know this?
323560	327560	When you write a multi-camera script, you have to write in where the people laugh?
327560	328560	Did you know that?
328560	329560	No, you don't.
329560	330560	No, I'm kidding.
330560	332560	That would be amazing.
332560	339560	People laugh when people chuckle and people go, ooh.
339560	347560	Can we do a reading of the script tonight?
347560	350560	No, I don't think we're allowed to. That's ridiculous.
350560	353560	They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for it.
353560	356560	I can't read it.
356560	357560	Ten dollars worth?
357560	360560	Yeah, give us like one couplet.
360560	365560	I did some tasty fade-ins.
365560	368560	That's ten dollars worth it.
368560	369560	What makes a tasty fade?
369560	374560	I used the letter Q quite a bit, ways you might not expect.
374560	376560	I'm legally liable now.
376560	379560	The letter Q is used eight times in the script.
379560	381560	You know too much.
381560	384560	It's about a guy and his daughter.
384560	387560	You can't really get deeper than that in a multi-camera sitcom.
387560	388560	It's about a guy and his daughter.
388560	389560	It's about relationships, Jeff.
389560	392560	Multi-camera sitcoms are not a base or art form.
392560	396560	In fact, they are, in television terms, more classic, obviously.
396560	399560	We started with the honeymooners when we started making sitcoms.
399560	403560	We started with the idea that these were plays that were adapted for larger audiences,
403560	406560	but at their heart were a couple hundred people watching something,
406560	408560	reacting together as human beings.
408560	414560	So they may seem to our new cinematic savvy eyes as being somehow more primitive
414560	416560	or cheesy or watered down or silly,
416560	419560	but I think that's just because a lot of them are written very poorly
419560	423560	and I think that I turned in one that's superior to everything on television.
423560	427560	I think I'm going to revitalize the whole format.
427560	428560	I think people are going to be going,
428560	432560	why doesn't everyone laugh at everything all the time when you're watching it?
432560	440560	And it's going to bury the voice and American Idol and Major League Baseball.
440560	444560	Everyone's going to start watching shows about guys in an apartment
444560	449560	that can't make the rent and have a dog forever.
449560	452560	I think this is a nice looking place.
452560	454560	Dave and Corey, that's their names, right?
454560	456560	The guys that run the place?
456560	457560	Dave and Corey?
457560	459560	Am I getting that right?
459560	465560	Okay, Dave and Corey are too modest to call out yes.
465560	470560	They were interior design guys before they opened this club.
470560	473560	That's not a joke.
473560	476560	They told me.
476560	482560	And their Wi-Fi password is DaveCorey2630.
482560	484560	Why would you tell them that?
484560	486560	Well, because if anyone wants to get on the Wi-Fi...
486560	488560	Oh, I see, okay.
488560	490560	We're going to fragment this audience to pieces.
490560	492560	We're going to be checking our Facebooks.
492560	495560	And I said, are you guys 26 or 30 years old?
495560	499560	Because I know my passwords often have my ages attached to them.
499560	502560	When the thing says you have to have a number, you know.
502560	504560	I just stick my age on there.
504560	506560	So over the years, I'm like, God damn it.
506560	512560	Was I 37 or 38 when I started getting into feet?
512560	516560	When I went through my latex phase.
516560	519560	What porn password did you think you have?
519560	520560	Impossible, Jeff.
520560	522560	An impossible calculation.
522560	527560	Fortunately, I lose my credit cards enough that they expire by virtue of, you know,
527560	529560	I just get a lot of emails going.
529560	530560	We tried to bill your credit card.
530560	532560	Yeah, fuck you.
532560	534560	Yeah, that's what you get for your sneaky ways,
534560	540560	capitalizing on people in a moment of weakness.
540560	543560	I'm not only a porn addict, I'm also a drunk.
543560	546560	I lost my wallet again.
546560	555560	So I jerked off only as much as I needed to.
555560	558560	But no, Dave and Corey are not 26 and 30,
558560	560560	but that's how old they were when they started their first business.
560560	562560	I thought that was cool.
562560	563560	I don't know.
563560	566560	I thought that was...
566560	571560	It's funny the way that we have public things like Wi-Fi names
571560	575560	and license plates and things that you can open a little hobbit door
575560	577560	and go into a...
577560	579560	All of a sudden you're finding out things about people.
579560	583560	For example, Jeff, I don't have an example.
583560	585560	That would have been so cool.
585560	587560	I've known you for a long time.
587560	590560	You've gone through a series of fetishes, or maybe...
590560	591560	Let's talk about that.
591560	592560	Yeah.
592560	593560	It's Rhode Island.
593560	594560	It's not going to...
594560	596560	You know, where's this going to go?
596560	599560	Are you on something new that I don't know about?
599560	602560	Have you gone down a new rabbit hole into finding out...
602560	603560	That's a good question.
603560	605560	What have I been into tracing my...
605560	607560	I wish I could trace history.
607560	608560	For those of you who've listened before,
608560	612560	I was at Dan's apartment years and years ago,
612560	617560	and he had taken all these individual pages out of titty mags
617560	620560	and playboys and stuff and put them in a manila folder.
620560	623560	Rather than having all the magazines around,
623560	625560	he just took out the pages that were potent.
625560	626560	Right.
626560	628560	Anybody ever do that?
628560	629560	That's probably like a thing.
629560	630560	Oh, God.
630560	632560	Is it Marissa?
632560	634560	Is your mom here again?
634560	635560	Oh.
635560	636560	Yeah.
636560	638560	We brought this girl's mom on stage last night,
638560	640560	and we talked about masturbation, and it was...
640560	642560	It was touch and go.
642560	644560	And I...
644560	647560	Oh, I'm good by accident.
647560	650560	That was accidental gold.
650560	654560	Anybody over, I would estimate, 30,
654560	657560	any guy over 30 might know about that process,
657560	660560	where, like, maybe you'd have to be over 35.
660560	665560	Like, the consolidation phase, when you're like...
665560	666560	Guys...
666560	670560	I've never met a guy who didn't have this problem.
670560	673560	You tend to hoard pornography.
673560	675560	Like, you can't throw it away.
675560	677560	We get bored with it.
677560	681560	You look at a picture of a certain person.
681560	684560	See how inclusive I was there?
685560	687560	And you...
687560	688560	You could be like,
688560	689560	Holy shit, this is amazing.
689560	690560	This is right up my alley.
690560	691560	Okay, great.
691560	694560	But it's like any MP3 or anything,
694560	696560	you know, or a piece of chewing gum or anything.
696560	697560	It's just a picture.
697560	700560	It's not Aaron McGathey at the end of the day.
700560	701560	Nice save.
701560	703560	Nice save.
703560	706560	It's not someone you can love who brings you steak salads
706560	708560	when you're working on your pilot
708560	710560	and who serves you tea when you have the sniffles
710560	712560	and cuddles up with you in the morning
712560	715560	and who looks like a little baby strawberry
715560	717560	up under your comforter.
717560	718560	She just gave you the business backstage
718560	720560	about sneaking a nacho, though.
720560	721560	Yeah, well, she cares about me.
721560	723560	She wants me to live long enough.
723560	725560	And I'm 12 years older than her.
725560	726560	Sometimes she'll sit me down and go,
726560	729560	Dan, you're gonna die.
729560	733560	You gotta eat good.
733560	736560	Is she the specter of death?
736560	737560	She puts her hand on my face
737560	740560	and spreads her fingers in a weird way and says,
740560	741560	you're gonna die.
741560	743560	You're gonna die.
743560	745560	She cares about me.
745560	750560	No, but even though the pornography loses its flavor,
750560	754560	guys, I'm not gonna say back me up on this.
754560	757560	But if anyone who is the exception to this rule,
757560	759560	I would love to talk to you,
759560	763560	you kind of, you can't, I just, I can't throw it away.
763560	766560	And now we've gone into this age where it's on your hard drive
766560	768560	instead of like under your bed in a box or something,
768560	774560	back before the internet made all periodical pornography obsolete,
774560	776560	it was like there were these magazines,
776560	779560	and if you were like me and you were in your 20s
779560	781560	and you were like, okay, I'm gonna get another one
781560	783560	because everything loses its flavor,
783560	785560	but you can't throw the old ones away.
785560	787560	So what you're describing is you found my manila folder
787560	789560	full of consolidated porn.
789560	791560	Yeah, the greatest hits.
791560	793560	Like, I gotta, just out of sheer bulk,
793560	795560	I gotta clear the decks here,
795560	798560	but I'm gonna take the pages out that are most important,
798560	802560	and I'll put them all in a manila folder that was about this thick.
802560	805560	And Jeff was going through them, oh, I'm sorry, this thick,
805560	809560	I've held up my hands about two inches, two inches thick.
809560	812560	The, uh, Jeff, Jeff found it and was going through it,
812560	813560	and was like, what is this?
813560	816560	Oh, that's my porn consolidation file.
816560	818560	When I moved from such and such to such and such,
818560	823560	I, I consolidated for, to save you hall space.
823560	825560	And he's looking through it, and he, and he goes,
825560	828560	geez, you gotta, gotta think for redheads, huh?
828560	830560	And I was like, I do?
830560	832560	And then I looked through it and they were all redheads.
832560	835560	Not, not an exciting story, but very interesting that I didn't see that.
835560	838560	Yeah, but then, but then you started going down a road of,
838560	842560	yeah, mannequin legs, nylons on mannequin legs,
842560	846560	videos about women under the table popping their shoe off their heel.
846560	847560	Right.
847560	849560	Uh, then you bought the real, real doll,
849560	852560	we didn't see you for a year.
852560	854560	Until you fucked her head off or something?
854560	855560	What happened?
855560	857560	Did the head start to kind of tear?
857560	859560	Well, that sounds violent. Yeah, yeah.
859560	862560	Anybody that works, like, in television special effects
862560	865560	will tell you that latex and silicone and stuff,
865560	868560	that stuff degrades, you know?
868560	872560	So, and then you see these ads for,
872560	874560	oh, buy a fake woman made out of this stuff,
874560	876560	and you're like, ah, it's the perfect crime.
876560	878560	Like, I'll take myself off the market,
878560	880560	I'll spare all these poor women, I'll spare myself,
880560	883560	like, everyone will win, but then six months later,
883560	885560	it's like the head's falling off.
885560	888560	It's awful, it's awful, yeah.
888560	890560	It's really grody.
890560	891560	So where are you at now?
891560	894560	Because when do you throw that thing away?
894560	896560	If you keep a magazine,
896560	901560	when do you throw away your $6,000 rubber woman?
901560	906560	You just roll her up in a rug and throw her off the 101 freeway.
906560	907560	Awful.
907560	910560	Thank God I had an assistant by that time.
910560	913560	Oh, God.
913560	915560	You made someone do it for you? Yeah, yeah.
915560	917560	How did she or he dispose of it?
917560	920560	Just ask her, I don't know.
920560	922560	I went on a road trip, said,
922560	924560	that crate better be gone when I get back.
924560	928560	It's depressing.
928560	932560	It's like came in a crate that's like a Stephen King thing.
932560	934560	I mean, think of the alternatives.
934560	936560	Is it supposed to come in a spider web?
936560	942560	Is it supposed to come in a cocoon, like a gremlin?
942560	943560	So where are you at now?
943560	945560	What's floating in your boat now?
945560	948560	I don't know.
948560	952560	I don't know.
952560	953560	You don't know that you can tell us,
953560	954560	or you don't know what it is?
954560	956560	Well, I'm in a relationship now,
956560	961560	so number one, it's not so much about exploration.
961560	963560	When you get the chance or have the urge,
963560	964560	it's more of a shotgun thing.
964560	967560	You're just like, all right, I'll tell you whatever.
967560	971560	But also, because I'm in a relationship,
971560	973560	it's really not the time to get that specific,
973560	974560	like the contrary.
974560	975560	I don't know.
975560	977560	It feels like the past is more,
977560	980560	you're more allowed to be honest about the past,
980560	982560	but I don't know if I...
982560	983560	Let's talk about yesterday.
983560	984560	Yesterday.
984560	988560	Green-haired, middle-aged women, I was into.
988560	993560	Oh, I thought you meant like...
993560	995560	Erin flired for the show today.
995560	999560	She's so dedicated to my happiness
999560	1003560	that she printed up a thousand flyers for the show
1003560	1006560	and just took them around to hand out to people.
1006560	1015560	Is anyone here because of the flyer?
1015560	1017560	Way to go.
1017560	1019560	That doesn't mean the fliring was ineffective.
1019560	1022560	It only means that she forgot to put the showtime on them.
1022560	1026560	It was a very hasty, love-motivated job.
1026560	1028560	It was less about engineering
1028560	1031560	and more about an expression of wanting me to be happy.
1031560	1034560	I was told that the first flyer she handed to somebody,
1034560	1035560	a girl goes, oh, that's great.
1035560	1037560	What time's the show?
1037560	1044560	And I was like, oh, fuck.
1044560	1045560	What time is the show?
1045560	1046560	That's what's weird.
1046560	1048560	The answer is 5.30.
1048560	1049560	For those of you in podcast land,
1049560	1053560	the sun is still streaming in through the Rhode Island skylights.
1053560	1058560	There's a cat lazily napping on the warm sidewalk.
1058560	1060560	There's eggs on the griddle.
1060560	1063560	And we're doing a little comedy, a little conversative comedy
1063560	1066560	before Bobcat Goldthwaite comes on at 6 p.m.
1066560	1067560	What's he...
1067560	1068560	7.30, I think.
1068560	1071560	This is the second time that we have found ourselves
1071560	1074560	inadvertently opening for Bobcat.
1074560	1076560	And I'm gonna do some checking after the show.
1076560	1078560	Actually, I'm gonna do some checking with Bob.
1079560	1081560	Who we know and love.
1081560	1085560	I wanna know from Bob if the same woman at our agency
1085560	1087560	is doing the booking of his shows.
1087560	1089560	Because if she's the one...
1089560	1093560	If the reason why every time we're in the same town as Bobcat
1093560	1095560	is because she's double booking rooms,
1095560	1098560	I'm gonna kick her in the fucking forehead.
1100560	1103560	Because I don't know how funny you guys feel at 5.30, but...
1105560	1107560	You should just be thankful that I'm an alcoholic
1107560	1110560	because no one should be this drunk.
1110560	1113560	Backstage, you're feeling pretty cocky about your self-worth
1113560	1116560	and you're talking about your powers as a writer.
1116560	1118560	You were hulking out back there.
1118560	1120560	Yeah, what's different? What do you mean?
1120560	1124560	I have a sociopathic edge to me right now, don't I?
1124560	1129560	Can't you hear the kind of weird, cold, even temper to my voice?
1129560	1135560	Don't I seem a little soulless and kind of into myself?
1136560	1138560	Unapologetic.
1138560	1142560	Just as a barometer, I just want to do a little experiment
1142560	1146560	just to see how different you are tonight from other nights.
1152560	1154560	Yo.
1154560	1156560	Yo, yo.
1157560	1158560	Yo, yo.
1158560	1160560	Bread, butter, milk, salt.
1160560	1162560	I fucked your mama, asphalt.
1162560	1165560	I fucked your mama, the sky is blue.
1165560	1167560	I fucked your mama one time in two.
1167560	1170560	I fucked your mama on the point of her nose.
1170560	1173560	I fucked your mama and a tree grows out of her face
1173560	1175560	where I fucked her.
1175560	1177560	That's how fertile my semen is.
1179560	1180560	Yo, yo.
1180560	1181560	Pretty good, pretty good, yeah.
1181560	1183560	I think you're...
1183560	1185560	You're about there.
1186560	1188560	I don't know.
1188560	1189560	You know my mama's dead, right?
1189560	1190560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1190560	1192560	So is Aaron, so is everybody's.
1192560	1195560	Big, big whoop-de-do for you and all your dead moms.
1195560	1199560	Maybe it's because you keep fucking people and trees grow out of their face.
1201560	1203560	All I do is express myself.
1203560	1206560	I mean, maybe I wish I had a dead mom.
1206560	1208560	That's another way of saying it.
1209560	1211560	Yo, yo, yo.
1211560	1215560	Mom, if you're listening, that doesn't mean I wish you were dead.
1215560	1217560	It just means I wish I had a dead mom.
1217560	1219560	It's two different things.
1219560	1222560	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
1223560	1225560	I mean, it's like...
1226560	1228560	Would you for rap purposes?
1228560	1230560	Because obviously you don't literally mean you're gonna fuck my mother
1230560	1232560	or these people's mothers.
1232560	1234560	Would you ever rap about fucking your own mother?
1234560	1236560	Uh, yeah, sure.
1242560	1244560	Yo, yo, yo.
1245560	1246560	I fucked my own mom.
1246560	1248560	It was amazing.
1249560	1251560	Skies were hazing.
1251560	1253560	It was Judgment Day.
1253560	1255560	I fucked my own mom in an intimate way.
1255560	1257560	I curled up with her in a hamlet bed.
1257560	1260560	I said, oh, baby, gonna kiss your head.
1260560	1262560	I would go down to your collarbone.
1262560	1264560	I'm gonna fuck you like I was alone.
1264560	1267560	I'm gonna jerk off on your chinny and your knee.
1267560	1269560	I'm gonna fuck you like I only fucked me.
1269560	1272560	I'm gonna roll you over and fuck you from behind.
1272560	1274560	I'm gonna fuck your pussy and see what I find.
1274560	1275560	It's a wedding ring.
1275560	1277560	It's my dad's.
1277560	1279560	Oh, shit, I fucked you bad.
1279560	1281560	I fucked you.
1282560	1284560	Fucked you.
1284560	1286560	Freudian style.
1286560	1288560	Yeah, that's pretty good. That's good.
1293560	1295560	Did you see...
1295560	1296560	I don't know if you saw that...
1296560	1298560	Between where I said...
1298560	1300560	I forgot Oedipus' name.
1300560	1302560	Oh, is that where you started scrambling?
1302560	1304560	Yeah, I was like, Orpheus?
1304560	1305560	What is it?
1305560	1306560	Right.
1306560	1308560	That's a senior moment.
1308560	1310560	I lost the word Oedipus.
1310560	1313560	You don't get more primal than the word Oedipus.
1313560	1316560	If you're talking about fucking your mom...
1316560	1318560	And you forget the word Oedipus,
1318560	1322560	you got a couple scripts left in you before you need to...
1325560	1327560	Hunter the old Thompson.
1329560	1332560	Foster the Wallace.
1332560	1335560	Spalding your grave.
1335560	1338560	Hemming your way.
1338560	1339560	Yeah, what?
1339560	1340560	What are the continued groans?
1340560	1343560	Wait, that guy killed himself.
1343560	1346560	Wait, so did that guy.
1346560	1348560	Three guys that killed...
1348560	1350560	Those are all right.
1350560	1351560	What are you...
1351560	1355560	This next one better be a florist that lived forever.
1355560	1357560	That's another crater that killed himself.
1357560	1360560	I'm gonna fucking freak out.
1362560	1364560	Spalding graves from Rhode Island.
1364560	1365560	Nice.
1365560	1366560	I knew that.
1366560	1367560	Full circle.
1367560	1368560	Thank you, sir.
1368560	1369560	Really?
1369560	1370560	Originally, he was born in Rhode Island?
1370560	1371560	Did he live here?
1371560	1374560	I was so bummed out when he killed himself.
1374560	1377560	I get bummed out any time anyone kills himself,
1377560	1380560	but I don't know about most of the people.
1380560	1382560	And I really, really respect it, Spalding Gray,
1382560	1385560	as I'm sure a lot of people here did.
1385560	1388560	It's such a fucking bummer.
1388560	1390560	When you...
1390560	1392560	Yeah, like these talented people.
1393560	1397560	A fan in the Brooklyn show came up to me
1397560	1400560	and gave me a David Foster Wallace novel
1400560	1402560	that I never knew David Foster Wallace wrote
1402560	1405560	because I just thought that David Foster Wallace was an essayist.
1405560	1408560	I didn't really actually know that he was an amazing novelist.
1408560	1409560	Was that a giant one?
1409560	1410560	I was like, not a great fan.
1410560	1411560	Infinite Jest or another one?
1411560	1412560	Yeah, Infinite Jest.
1412560	1413560	That's a big-ass book.
1413560	1414560	That's like a phone book.
1414560	1417560	So I simultaneously learned that David Foster Wallace
1417560	1420560	had written a novel and that he had killed himself
1420560	1421560	in, I think, 2008.
1421560	1423560	I didn't know either of those facts.
1423560	1426560	I bought that book the day before he died.
1426560	1428560	It was really weird.
1428560	1430560	Haven't read it.
1430560	1432560	That one's especially tragic because...
1432560	1434560	I mean, I think they're all probably...
1434560	1435560	I don't know.
1435560	1437560	It's probably linkage to...
1437560	1439560	It's just so clearly kind of chemical,
1439560	1443560	like he was on meds and he had to go off of them
1443560	1445560	because they were causing him trouble
1445560	1447560	and then he started to have troubles.
1447560	1450560	It just sounds like...
1450560	1453560	When people kill themselves, it's kind of by definition,
1453560	1455560	you think, well, that's a voluntary act.
1455560	1457560	If someone gets hit by a subway train
1457560	1459560	or hit by lightning or gets cancer,
1459560	1462560	that's by definition an involuntary act.
1462560	1466560	But when people are kind of chemically troubled
1466560	1469560	and there's medication involved and then they can't...
1469560	1473560	It's weird because it's as involuntary, it seems,
1473560	1475560	as getting hit by a train.
1475560	1477560	Like if you caught this person on the right day
1477560	1480560	at the right time and gave them the right thing
1480560	1483560	in their pancake syrup or something,
1483560	1486560	you could keep them from making this decision
1486560	1488560	that was going to last forever.
1488560	1490560	Terrible, awful.
1490560	1492560	Hey, let's do the raffle.
1492560	1494560	Yeah!
1495560	1497560	Everybody look under your seats.
1497560	1500560	We're giving away lithium tonight.
1500560	1503560	If you think you need it, please use it,
1503560	1506560	especially if you're an incredibly talented writer.
1506560	1510560	I will never do that, I don't think.
1510560	1512560	I'm not talented enough and I also...
1512560	1514560	I'm too chicken shit and too...
1514560	1516560	I don't think I...
1516560	1520560	Yeah, I could never picture myself doing that.
1520560	1524560	But at the same time, didn't Spalding Grey do it
1524560	1526560	because he was in a lot of physical pain?
1526560	1528560	Wasn't he fucked up?
1528560	1530560	Yeah, he was in an auto accident in Ireland.
1530560	1531560	Right.
1531560	1534560	And he came back and he couldn't ever get over that.
1534560	1536560	Yeah, that must be...
1536560	1539560	To repeat that, in case we didn't pick that up,
1539560	1541560	he was in an auto accident in Ireland
1541560	1543560	and he never got over it,
1543560	1545560	meaning I'm assuming the pain never...
1545560	1547560	That was chronic and he couldn't handle it.
1547560	1548560	Or there's people that have...
1548560	1550560	What's the thing with your ears ringing?
1550560	1551560	Tintinabulation or whatever.
1551560	1553560	Tinnitus rather, yeah.
1553560	1555560	It just drives them insane
1555560	1558560	that they can never get this sound out of their ears
1558560	1559560	and stuff like that.
1559560	1560560	That's madness.
1560560	1563560	Jesus Christ.
1563560	1566560	Let's all fucking kill ourselves right now.
1566560	1568560	Would you guys do that?
1568560	1570560	Just make this the most interesting...
1570560	1572560	I'm gonna count to three.
1572560	1574560	And it's on three, you guys.
1574560	1577560	It's not one, two, three, go.
1577560	1580560	It's one, two, bang.
1580560	1583560	Jeff, how would you do it?
1583560	1584560	Kill myself?
1584560	1586560	Not jump off something.
1586560	1587560	No, never.
1587560	1588560	That's crazy.
1588560	1589560	How would I do it?
1589560	1591560	All those people that jump off the Golden Gate Bridge,
1591560	1592560	which is numerous.
1592560	1594560	Hey, Erin, can you hear me?
1594560	1595560	Yeah.
1595560	1597560	I think you remembered this number.
1597560	1600560	How many people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge every year?
1600560	1604560	It's something like eight.
1604560	1606560	I mean, the staff is weird.
1606560	1609560	It's like eight every two weeks or something.
1609560	1610560	Yeah, okay.
1610560	1611560	Eight every two weeks, you said.
1611560	1613560	So like four every week.
1613560	1623560	Some of them are doing it because, you know, math was never...
1623560	1628560	A couple hundred a year, one more?
1628560	1630560	Wait, is that really?
1630560	1631560	Sixty a month?
1631560	1633560	That can't be right.
1633560	1635560	Okay, we have to make this much more than that
1635560	1637560	because a lot of people jump off in the middle of the night
1637560	1639560	and their bodies are just swept away from the ocean.
1639560	1642560	So that's the number that they spot.
1642560	1645560	Wow, we...
1645560	1646560	I hope we pick that up.
1646560	1647560	Oh, I have an answer.
1647560	1649560	I love Erin's tone of having to report this
1649560	1652560	from the back of a town hall in Rhode Island.
1652560	1655560	It's about a...
1655560	1656560	I have my answer.
1656560	1657560	I would firing squad.
1657560	1659560	I would do it fucking old school firing squad.
1659560	1660560	No way, no.
1660560	1662560	Because you see the footage of a firing squad
1662560	1663560	and the guy's there and he's got a cigarette
1663560	1666560	and he says, leave La France when he puts a cigarette.
1666560	1668560	And then they go, bang, and he's fucking gone.
1668560	1669560	No way, okay.
1669560	1671560	He's in heaven or hell the next moment.
1671560	1672560	He doesn't...
1672560	1674560	It's not electric chair or pills
1674560	1676560	or the carbon monoxide in the garage.
1676560	1677560	I would absolutely...
1677560	1679560	And also, there would be the drums.
1679560	1684560	And then you go like, I'm fucking doing this right.
1684560	1688560	This is some 17th century shit going down here.
1688560	1690560	That's how you do it.
1690560	1691560	I don't know.
1691560	1696560	Too much suicide formation.
1696560	1702560	And that's not even suicide.
1702560	1704560	When are you going to go to heaven and try to play it off?
1704560	1705560	Like you're going to...
1705560	1706560	Oh, no.
1706560	1707560	A bunch of guys shot me.
1707560	1708560	We know what you did.
1708560	1709560	Oh, okay.
1709560	1711560	I would make a time machine, go back in time
1711560	1713560	and try to kill the king.
1713560	1716560	And then they would ask me how I wanted to die
1716560	1719560	and it would be death by...
1719560	1722560	I would be killing myself by choosing to die by...
1722560	1723560	I want to kill myself.
1723560	1727560	Attempted regicide.
1727560	1729560	I'm going to go hang myself.
1729560	1733560	No, I'm not going to go hang myself.
1733560	1735560	The show's not going that bad.
1735560	1736560	You're doing great.
1736560	1738560	I'm going to go with hanging myself.
1738560	1739560	Really?
1739560	1740560	Because that seems...
1740560	1741560	That's not so clean.
1741560	1743560	You dangle, you pee yourself.
1743560	1747560	Yeah, but people do it just like sitting.
1747560	1750560	Like they do it on accident while jerking off,
1750560	1755560	which means that you can do it kind of like an accident...
1755560	1758560	If you can accidentally do it while you're jerking off,
1758560	1760560	that means it must be pretty painless.
1760560	1761560	David Carradine.
1761560	1762560	Yeah.
1762560	1764560	The guy from INXS, right?
1764560	1765560	No.
1765560	1766560	Kill Bill.
1766560	1767560	Like a legend.
1767560	1768560	No, no, no.
1768560	1770560	I don't mean David Carradine was in INXS.
1770560	1771560	I was adding to his list.
1771560	1774560	David Carradine did autoerotic asphyxiation, we believe,
1774560	1776560	and the lead singer of INXS.
1776560	1779560	But I wouldn't want to die by doing my dick in my hands.
1779560	1782560	Well, no, I'm not going to jerk off.
1782560	1784560	Because it wouldn't even be hard.
1784560	1790560	Those guys accidentally killed themselves while jerking off.
1790560	1792560	We don't know that.
1792560	1795560	Yeah, we do because their dicks were in their hands.
1795560	1799560	I'm saying that, therefore, because you're able to do it
1799560	1801560	while having that much pleasure,
1801560	1805560	and so obviously those guys had everything to live for in that moment.
1805560	1807560	They would have stopped if they had known.
1807560	1808560	No shit, I'm dying.
1808560	1809560	They would have stopped,
1809560	1813560	which means that they weren't conscious enough of the fact
1813560	1815560	that they were dying to stop it,
1815560	1817560	which means, to me, perfect death.
1817560	1823560	Because it means that you could actually sit in a relaxed position
1823560	1826560	and arrange a thing around your neck, a ligature.
1826560	1829560	Are you kids listening?
1829560	1832560	And do enough with your own weight
1832560	1836560	that you could lose consciousness and drift off into infinity.
1836560	1839560	But second to that, carbon monoxide, for the same reason,
1839560	1842560	because it happens on accident and people don't stop it from happening.
1842560	1843560	So I think you go to sleep.
1843560	1846560	I'm scared of pills because I think you would...
1846560	1848560	You might...
1848560	1849560	So the guy on the front goes,
1849560	1853560	This is a great show.
1853560	1854560	This is exactly...
1854560	1856560	Last night they were fucking mamas,
1856560	1857560	and they were like,
1857560	1859560	Everyone's going to die tonight.
1859560	1860560	All right.
1860560	1862560	Just kind of curious...
1862560	1863560	Before we get off this topic,
1863560	1865560	because I'm just curious about it.
1866560	1869560	Who here has killed themselves?
1869560	1873560	Well, who here would do it jumping off of something?
1873560	1874560	There's a couple of hands.
1874560	1876560	I'm not going to make you come up and talk about it.
1876560	1878560	I just wanted to see percentage ones.
1878560	1879560	This was four or five or six people.
1879560	1881560	And I think it's weird.
1881560	1883560	It's not like a bell curve where it's like,
1883560	1885560	A bunch of people would do it by shooting themselves,
1885560	1888560	and then 10% of people want to burn to death.
1888560	1893560	It's almost like a weird fractal pattern.
1893560	1897560	Everyone's a little snowflake of suicide.
1897560	1900560	Most importantly, I think nobody would kill themselves, mostly.
1900560	1901560	Let's make an agreement.
1901560	1903560	No suicides tonight.
1903560	1908560	I feel like legally I have to...
1908560	1911560	Legally I have to say that real quick before we part that topic.
1911560	1915560	Let's come up with a new reason for all of us to live.
1915560	1917560	We all have our own reasons.
1917560	1918560	Let's find out...
1918560	1920560	Obama's inauguration.
1920560	1922560	This little community that we've created here tonight,
1922560	1923560	this audience has its own...
1923560	1925560	We're all one brand new organism.
1925560	1928560	Let's create a brand new reason to never kill ourselves.
1928560	1929560	To see Dan's new show.
1929560	1931560	To see Dan's new show is a good reason?
1931560	1934560	While you're getting stuff from the audience,
1934560	1937560	I'm creating a new reason myself back here.
1937560	1939560	Dan has gone back to the sandwich cart
1939560	1943560	to make himself a nice new vodka on the rocks.
1943560	1947560	Erin McGathey came backstage while we were getting ready,
1947560	1949560	and she was very excited because she was like,
1949560	1951560	Hey, guys, Erin from last night at the show
1951560	1953560	outside of Boston is here.
1953560	1954560	And we're like, oh, yeah, cool.
1954560	1955560	She was cool.
1955560	1957560	And I said, oh, the black girl, right?
1957560	1959560	And she's like, yeah.
1959560	1961560	I'm like, is that why you're telling us?
1961560	1962560	Is that why that's interesting?
1962560	1964560	And she was like, yeah, it's a black Erin.
1964560	1967560	I'd never met a black Erin before.
1967560	1968560	Black Erin?
1968560	1970560	Yeah, black Erin, get up here, would you?
1970560	1977560	Whoa, black Erin.
1977560	1979560	Whoa, black Erin.
1979560	1988560	She's like Erin, but she's black.
1988560	1992560	It proves that race is an artificial construct.
1992560	1994560	There's a black Erin.
1994560	1995560	Hello.
1995560	1997560	Are you okay coming up here?
1997560	1998560	You're such a sweetheart.
1998560	2003560	We met last night in that place that's not Boston, Summerville.
2003560	2005560	You look kind of dressed like a black Erin.
2005560	2007560	I could see Erin McGathey if she were black,
2007560	2008560	but I'm dressed exactly like that.
2008560	2009560	It's an Erin outfit.
2009560	2010560	I didn't even, yeah.
2010560	2012560	She's got little black tights on and stuff like that.
2012560	2014560	Yeah, I'm so obsessed with race.
2014560	2017560	I didn't even, yeah.
2017560	2020560	You were here, you were in Summerville,
2020560	2024560	and you were with this dude that, is he here tonight?
2024560	2025560	He's here.
2025560	2026560	Oh, okay.
2026560	2028560	Because I thought, didn't you say, what was your name, sir?
2028560	2029560	Matt.
2029560	2030560	Matt.
2030560	2032560	I remember having a conversation about this.
2032560	2034560	I was trying to figure out what your MO was.
2034560	2039560	Weren't you like, you're not from any of these places, are you?
2039560	2040560	No, I'm from Colorado.
2040560	2041560	Right, so.
2041560	2042560	Colorado.
2042560	2046560	And you're staying with your friend Matt for the Summerville show.
2046560	2049560	Well, Matt's from Vermont.
2049560	2056560	We decided to come to Boston for the Summerville show,
2056560	2061560	and since Rhode Island is close, we decided to come down here too.
2061560	2066560	But then, I'm wrong saying, are you going to a third show too?
2066560	2067560	I'm going to Denver too.
2067560	2069560	Right, because that's in Colorado where you're from.
2069560	2070560	Yes, yes.
2070560	2071560	Okay, that's where the confusion is,
2071560	2074560	because that's where I was saying, oh, is Matt going to be there too?
2074560	2076560	And you're like, no, because Matt's from around here.
2076560	2077560	Right.
2077560	2078560	All right, all right.
2078560	2079560	It's not that intriguing.
2079560	2083560	I thought I would stumble on to solving a bank robbery,
2083560	2085560	like Spree or something.
2085560	2087560	Like you guys were, there was a trail of receipts.
2087560	2089560	We could turn you in.
2089560	2091560	Erin was saying that there was some interesting story
2091560	2092560	to why your name is Erin.
2092560	2093560	Is that true?
2093560	2097560	Oh, well, I was just mentioning in Freakonomics,
2097560	2102560	I told Erin that there's a chapter about naming children,
2102560	2110560	how it's harder to get a job when your name is something like Latisha
2110560	2112560	or something more ethnic sounding.
2112560	2115560	And my mother made sure that all of her children's names
2115560	2119560	were neutral sounding or sounded, you know,
2119560	2124560	she wanted to make sure that we'd be able to at least get her foot in the door.
2124560	2125560	Has that worked out for you?
2125560	2127560	What do you do for a living?
2127560	2130560	I'm a professional Latisha.
2131560	2132560	Right now, I'm a student.
2132560	2133560	Okay, great.
2133560	2134560	What do you study?
2134560	2136560	I'm studying web design and computer programming.
2136560	2137560	Oh, fantastic.
2137560	2143560	Do you feel like your less ethnic name has given you that foot in the door?
2143560	2146560	I think it's a lot of things.
2146560	2154560	And I honestly, I can't tell because I've lived my entire life with being an Erin.
2154560	2160560	There are some pretty crazy names though.
2160560	2163560	My friend, I went to school with a girl named Exquisita, which is awesome.
2163560	2164560	Wow.
2164560	2165560	Wow.
2165560	2170560	It's kind of what brings up a weird and probably uncomfortable topic though,
2170560	2173560	the idea that like it comes up over and over again,
2173560	2179560	the idea of things that are somehow like that we identify as cultural
2179560	2183560	and then the things that like, you know, Bill Cosby rails against.
2184560	2189560	Two sides of the spectrum where, and then you can put yourself in any shoes
2189560	2192560	or I can anyway as a weird mixed up white guy.
2192560	2195560	Like I can't find a place where I'm comfortable just going,
2195560	2199560	oh, that's the empirical fact because like there are people who would go,
2199560	2202560	well, don't assimilate.
2202560	2205560	And then there's like, well, what are you assimilating?
2205560	2206560	Like what?
2206560	2212560	It's all so fucking confusing because it all starts with co-opting humanity,
2212560	2215560	bringing people over, giving them a job they didn't ask for,
2215560	2221560	for far below their pay grade, denying them, you know,
2221560	2224560	some staples like medicine, literacy, et cetera.
2224560	2227560	And then at some point changing our mind about it,
2227560	2230560	which is a great, great, great turn of events.
2230560	2234560	But the, and then, and then now all this like, like,
2234560	2241560	like now a complexion being linked to empirical realities,
2241560	2246560	demographically, like wealth distribution and things like that,
2246560	2251560	but it being conveniently racist to point out any correlations at someone's leisure.
2251560	2253560	A Republican gets to go, what do you mean?
2253560	2254560	I thought everyone was equal.
2254560	2256560	What do you mean he's black, therefore he's poor.
2256560	2258560	What are you, a racist?
2258560	2264560	And then like, it's awfully, it almost seems like only the bad guys win
2264560	2266560	as long as we keep staying confused about all of it.
2266560	2270560	As long as we keep just kind of like worrying about the fact that we're different.
2270560	2273560	And it seems like that's the only late motif.
2273560	2274560	That's it.
2274560	2277560	And that that's the only empirical truth is a class system,
2277560	2281560	that rich people kind of want poor people to just be unsure
2281560	2283560	about everything that unites them.
2283560	2285560	Bam!
2293560	2295560	Oh, I fucked your black mama.
2295560	2296560	I did it with my white dick.
2296560	2298560	So what?
2298560	2299560	I didn't care.
2299560	2300560	I'm not racist.
2300560	2303560	I united humanity with my dick.
2303560	2306560	Black mama.
2306560	2307560	I don't know.
2307560	2309560	Erin, do you have any opinions about any of this stuff?
2309560	2310560	I do.
2310560	2311560	All right.
2314560	2316560	Can you do them in two-four time?
2316560	2318560	Or do you want to, no.
2318560	2321560	Yeah, let's let it rip.
2321560	2322560	Do you want to beat?
2322560	2323560	No.
2323560	2324560	No.
2327560	2330560	It's actually one of the reasons I really like your show.
2330560	2336560	I love this podcast is because you have difficult conversations
2336560	2337560	about things like that.
2337560	2343560	It sort of feels like a journal, you know, like Dear Diary or something like that.
2343560	2347560	It definitely feels more like a journal than like, say, a screenplay or a TV show.
2347560	2352560	Something with structure that has a point to it.
2354560	2357560	But I mean, it's important to have difficult conversations
2357560	2361560	because whenever you don't talk about things, then it doesn't make the things go away.
2361560	2362560	Exactly.
2362560	2365560	Like every single, I mean, okay.
2365560	2368560	Like we've been a human race for quite a while.
2368560	2372560	And I'm sure that there were times when there were bigger problems
2372560	2374560	than lack of communication.
2374560	2378560	Like people just stabbing you and fucking the stab hole
2378560	2381560	because you were like from somewhere else.
2381560	2384560	I'm sure there was like shit just happening right outside your front door
2384560	2387560	that had to be dealt with before we learned to communicate and be honest.
2387560	2392560	But now it seems like every single problem can be solved
2392560	2395560	through people speaking what's in their head, honestly.
2395560	2403560	And letting it, like because how far does a person who is our modern definition of racist,
2403560	2407560	how far is that person going to be able to state their case
2407560	2412560	before solutions start cropping up even to his own fucking brain.
2412560	2415560	Or hers.
2415560	2418560	Women can be racist. It's okay, ladies.
2418560	2423560	And it's like people communicating about that.
2423560	2429560	That's what makes me sound to some people like incredibly jaded and cynical,
2429560	2432560	even though the weird ironic truth is that I'm so optimistic
2432560	2436560	because what I believe is that people, once you start babbling,
2436560	2440560	like the inevitable result is that shit gets,
2440560	2443560	like that you thought was important stops being important.
2443560	2446560	Shit that you thought was a monster stops being,
2446560	2451560	it turns out to be your own reflection or like your dad's ghost or something.
2451560	2454560	And the reality just becomes like everyone looks so simple,
2454560	2458560	like we're on a playground again going, oh, I don't want to be alone.
2458560	2463560	If I had to choose anything, I'd just choose to be around other people.
2463560	2467560	Let's work the rest out as we have to.
2467560	2475560	But yeah, that's so I agree. I agree that my podcast is great.
2475560	2479560	I have a question. I mean, because I'm asking this ignorantly
2479560	2481560	because you're black and you're a woman.
2481560	2485560	What's more pervasive for you, racism in your life or sexism?
2485560	2490560	Like what do you feel you get the more prevalent or the most like,
2490560	2493560	like you get the most dominated by.
2493560	2495560	You can ask a more hypothetical sci-fi sense.
2495560	2498560	Like if you had, if you, if you got to have one button on your wrist
2498560	2502560	that could make you switch, like, like, but switch back anytime you wanted,
2502560	2506560	like, like, like, would you rather have a button that turned you into a dude
2506560	2509560	whenever you wanted or a button that made you white whenever you wanted?
2509560	2513560	I just made that up.
2513560	2515560	And you get to change back anytime. It's not, it's not,
2515560	2517560	it's not about, it's not about not liking yourself.
2517560	2525560	It's just about the social obstacles or whatever kind of inconveniences.
2525560	2530560	I, I think that I've probably never ever wanted to be a man.
2530560	2534560	I've never even considered it.
2534560	2539560	I think there's, you know, every kid has that moment in their life when they.
2539560	2543560	I haven't either, Aaron. Never wanted this.
2543560	2547560	I didn't ask for it. It's flapping around down there.
2547560	2550560	It seems very impractical.
2550560	2553560	I have nipples.
2553560	2554560	Sorry, go ahead.
2554560	2556560	You feel good. All right, sorry.
2556560	2559560	It's okay.
2559560	2562560	I grew up in the suburbs and I grew up around everybody.
2562560	2565560	Everybody else was white around me and I think whenever I was a kid,
2565560	2568560	I really didn't realize, it's not that I wanted to be white.
2568560	2571560	I think that I just didn't realize I was black.
2571560	2575560	And so whenever I did realize I was black, I was like, oh, well,
2575560	2577560	I don't want to be different. So.
2577560	2580560	Yeah, I had a lot of friends growing up when I was in Milwaukee public school.
2580560	2584560	Like when I was, when I was definitely in grade school,
2584560	2587560	it was like, I was sort of like that, that,
2587560	2591560	that I think Howard Stern said the same thing in his little movie that I saw.
2591560	2593560	He illustrated the same thing.
2593560	2596560	I was actually like a lone little, little white drop in a,
2596560	2597560	in a, in a, in a public school.
2597560	2600560	See that I didn't really perceive until later.
2600560	2603560	And like, I have like a little photos of me in class,
2603560	2606560	I think like, like at graduation ceremonies and it's like my head,
2606560	2609560	like in a sea of things that I now distinguish,
2609560	2612560	but that I didn't instinctively do back then.
2612560	2615560	And it's like, we find it hard to believe as a racially obsessed society
2615560	2617560	that it actually is an artificial construct,
2617560	2620560	but it is so much more artificial than so many more real things
2620560	2623560	that we've actually also been hypnotized to not pay attention to.
2623560	2627560	And that are more real, like, like, like, like, like poverty and wealth
2627560	2630560	and how that doesn't make you a good or a bad person.
2630560	2633560	Like we are very convinced that poor people are their own fault.
2633560	2636560	Like that when you wake up poor, you're a piece of shit,
2636560	2637560	you did something wrong.
2637560	2639560	We're also very convinced that when you get sick,
2639560	2640560	you did something wrong.
2640560	2643560	Like I still feel that somebody rolls into a room in a wheelchair,
2643560	2645560	I get fucking like I go into crisis mode.
2645560	2651560	Like my goal is to, is to figure out how to avoid like this poor person
2651560	2656560	who probably like would be into talking about what is wrong and what happened
2656560	2658560	and how hard it is and all this stuff.
2658560	2661560	But all I can think about through after school specials
2661560	2664560	and my own like narcissism is like, oh, fuck that guy.
2664560	2667560	Like I just got to be a living ghost or that's what's best for both of us.
2667560	2673560	And that's way more real than cheekbones and melanin in your skin
2673560	2675560	because there's a lot of like, yeah.
2675560	2679560	So anyways, I keep sounding like I'm like running for something.
2679560	2680560	It's stupid.
2680560	2686560	But I'm just, I'm probably flawfully like fascinated with this stuff.
2686560	2689560	And I, what was our point?
2689560	2690560	Wait, what were we on?
2690560	2691560	I derailed that.
2691560	2692560	I derailed it.
2692560	2694560	We're talking about sexism, racism, stuff like that.
2694560	2695560	Right.
2695560	2696560	Right.
2696560	2700560	I mean, sexism seems more real because women are chemically different from men.
2700560	2704560	They are, they literally have no penis from birth.
2704560	2708560	Like there's an actual hole where the penis goes on a man.
2708560	2712560	And there's, this is true.
2712560	2714560	No, it's true.
2714560	2718560	I'm just shaking my head back here.
2718560	2723560	And as an extension of sexism, then homophobia is actually a little more real
2723560	2726560	even though there's a huge difference between homophobia and racism
2726560	2731560	in that a homosexual can walk around and get a job and hang out.
2731560	2735560	And if they choose to, they can never have anyone or even themselves
2735560	2739560	be conscious of the thing that makes them different inside.
2739560	2743560	Women can't, like they can't escape their gender
2743560	2747560	and to the extent that we keep paying attention to race,
2747560	2749560	like people can't escape their race.
2749560	2751560	What's my point?
2751560	2754560	I don't know.
2754560	2758560	There's got to be like a card game we can make out of this.
2758560	2762560	What do we, I think, is the problem solving itself?
2762560	2766560	Are we just getting, we're getting, I noticed that like 20-year-olds
2766560	2771560	are bored with like things that used to make me laugh when I was 20.
2771560	2774560	You know, like race used to be a much hotter button
2774560	2776560	when you mashed it as a comedy writer.
2776560	2780560	Like I can see myself becoming antiquated in writer's rooms.
2780560	2784560	I can see people like Donald Glover like going like,
2784560	2786560	yeah, it's not that funny.
2786560	2788560	And it's not indignant or anything.
2788560	2792560	It's just getting hackier and hackier to mash those buttons,
2792560	2794560	which I think is a good sign.
2794560	2797560	Is it, is it, is it, is everything fading?
2797560	2800560	Is everything getting better?
2800560	2802560	Sure.
2802560	2805560	I think that things move in cycles, honestly,
2805560	2807560	and it's really difficult to tell,
2807560	2812560	especially with the recent history of race in this country.
2812560	2816560	I do think that the problem with people ignoring it
2816560	2819560	and getting bored with it is that they still haven't dealt with the problem,
2819560	2821560	the actual issue.
2821560	2823560	I mean, people...
2823560	2829560	The actual issue is legacy of a thing that actually factors into class, right?
2829560	2836560	It's class, it's privilege, it's just basically how we see each other.
2836560	2840560	I mean, I think sometimes people think racism is bad,
2840560	2845560	but basically we don't understand why racism is bad.
2845560	2849560	Or why sexism is bad.
2849560	2856560	We are focusing so much as a society on pinpointing little individual things
2856560	2859560	that people are just labeling, oh, this is PC.
2859560	2861560	Now we have to be PC.
2861560	2866560	We're actually like fucking up the problem by going,
2866560	2871560	okay, here's the seminar that the legal department can use to avoid legal liability.
2871560	2874560	We're going to teach all of you racist, sexist,
2874560	2876560	how to seem less racist and sexist in the workplace.
2876560	2879560	These are the things you're not allowed to say at the water cooler
2879560	2881560	in order to keep Sony from getting sued.
2881560	2885560	And so this guy who might become less racist or sexist
2885560	2888560	watches the video and goes, okay, I can't say nice tits.
2888560	2891560	And all he knows is that he can't say it.
2891560	2893560	He doesn't know why.
2893560	2899560	He doesn't know that it might get him laid more, for instance, to not say it.
2899560	2904560	He doesn't know that humanity is an individual thing.
2904560	2908560	He's not getting that from a sexual harassment seminar.
2908560	2909560	Yeah, all right.
2909560	2914560	Well, let's do something with Aaron that...
2914560	2917560	That's both racist and sexist.
2917560	2920560	Let's do a little...
2920560	2924560	I don't want to be too trite, but I want to do one of our little movies
2924560	2925560	or TV shows, Jeff.
2925560	2926560	I want to do a little...
2926560	2928560	I like that we've started doing this on the road.
2928560	2929560	Oh, boy.
2929560	2931560	You do a little...
2931560	2934560	Aaron, what's your big ambition?
2934560	2939560	What do you want to do?
2939560	2940560	Pie in the sky.
2940560	2942560	Dream gig.
2942560	2947560	I would love to do something creative that changes a lot of people
2947560	2949560	or affects a lot of people's lives.
2949560	2952560	And what are you doing now to pay your rent?
2952560	2957560	I'm a nanny, and I work at Banana Republic.
2957560	2961560	Two groups gave me some vocal support.
2961560	2964560	Or one very specific person.
2964560	2967560	I think white Aaron should come up and play black Aaron, though.
2967560	2969560	So anything?
2969560	2972560	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
2972560	2974560	In the role of a lifetime.
2974560	2975560	Okay.
2975560	2978560	We're going to test your range right now, Aaron.
2978560	2984560	Aaron McGathey is going to win a Tony for her portrayal of black Aaron.
2984560	2987560	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
2987560	2990560	I was a nanny.
2990560	2992560	Aaron was also a nanny, yes.
2992560	2993560	It's true.
2993560	2995560	Both Aaron's were nannies.
2995560	2997560	You still are nannying.
2997560	2998560	New Aaron.
2998560	2999560	New Aaron.
2999560	3001560	Yes.
3001560	3002560	All right.
3002560	3003560	So, all right.
3003560	3004560	She's a nanny.
3004560	3006560	She's worked at Banana Republic.
3006560	3011560	Her aspiration is to create things for people.
3011560	3013560	Change people's attitudes.
3013560	3015560	Change their minds.
3015560	3016560	Change your attitudes.
3016560	3017560	Change your minds.
3017560	3019560	Maybe open their minds.
3019560	3021560	Art or literature?
3021560	3022560	Art, literature.
3022560	3023560	I love to write.
3023560	3025560	I love to draw.
3025560	3028560	I want to be a graphic designer or web designer.
3028560	3030560	Just kind of creativity all across the board.
3030560	3031560	Yes.
3031560	3032560	That's great.
3032560	3033560	Something creative.
3033560	3034560	That's a great aspiration.
3034560	3035560	All right.
3035560	3036560	Here we go.
3036560	3038560	It's a new movie.
3039560	3042560	It's called Black Aaron.
3047560	3049560	Transparent Soul.
3053560	3054560	Transparent Heart.
3054560	3056560	Soul sounds racist.
3060560	3063560	Ah, dreams and peace.
3064560	3067560	Hey, world.
3067560	3070560	I'm going to work on changing you today.
3070560	3071560	So what?
3071560	3072560	You're black.
3072560	3074560	Oh!
3074560	3075560	What?
3075560	3077560	I'm black?
3077560	3080560	This is the moment when I realized I was black.
3083560	3084560	I...
3084560	3086560	What are you doing downstairs?
3086560	3087560	There's Aaron.
3087560	3090560	It's your mother making pancakes.
3090560	3092560	Honey, honey, leave her alone.
3092560	3094560	She's going through a rough time right now.
3094560	3095560	What do you mean?
3095560	3096560	She's my little girl.
3096560	3097560	She just found out she was black.
3097560	3099560	We should have told her a long time ago.
3099560	3102560	Oh, God.
3102560	3105560	You're going to have to go have one of those talks
3105560	3109560	that mothers give to their similarly raised children.
3110560	3111560	All right.
3111560	3114560	I suppose this is the bed I made.
3116560	3117560	Aaron?
3117560	3119560	Yes, Mom?
3120560	3123560	Your father told me about something that happened today.
3123560	3124560	Yeah.
3124560	3129560	I guess it's time to tell you about a world
3129560	3133560	that I tried to shield you from by giving you a neutral name.
3133560	3134560	I don't understand.
3134560	3135560	My name is Aaron.
3135560	3140560	Everyone named Aaron is a mousy or average-looking white girl.
3143560	3145560	Ladies, I'm sorry to interrupt.
3145560	3146560	Can I come in for a second?
3146560	3147560	Yes.
3147560	3150560	I feel like I've been a bad husband and father to both of you,
3150560	3151560	and I'll tell you why.
3151560	3154560	There's something I've been meaning to tell you both for a long time.
3154560	3156560	You're both women.
3156560	3157560	What?
3157560	3158560	Yes.
3158560	3159560	Oh, no, that's fine.
3159560	3160560	That's fine.
3160560	3161560	That's fine.
3161560	3162560	I'm fine with that.
3162560	3163560	I'm fine with that.
3163560	3165560	I feel like you should know that.
3165560	3166560	Oh.
3166560	3169560	Mom, I really hate Dad.
3170560	3176560	Your father is an award-winning obstetrician
3176560	3184560	who's given special accolades for his ability to notice gender.
3184560	3185560	Honey, honey.
3185560	3186560	Oh, my God.
3186560	3190560	The obstetrician's society is called I Won the Golden Fetus.
3190560	3193560	So I go back to what you were doing.
3193560	3197560	I have to go back out and destroy creativity in the world.
3198560	3199560	I mean, did you hear that?
3199560	3201560	He just said.
3201560	3202560	That's just his way.
3202560	3205560	The important thing is to love one another.
3205560	3211560	I gave you a mousey white girl's name because I didn't want you to be one thing or the other.
3211560	3214560	I wanted you to feel comfortable in a world.
3214560	3221560	My dream is that these problems that we're subjecting each other to will just go away.
3222560	3223560	All right.
3223560	3225560	That's very nice.
3226560	3228560	Good luck on your final exams.
3228560	3229560	Thank you, Mom.
3229560	3231560	Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
3231560	3232560	Heck.
3235560	3237560	Matt, no.
3238560	3242560	I just want to know if you still want to go to the snowball dance with me.
3244560	3246560	Matt, I have to focus.
3246560	3253560	I mean, if I'm going to change the world with art or music or graphic design or something else or speech or something,
3253560	3258560	first of all, I'm going to have to spend some time focusing, and then I'm going to have to do it.
3259560	3262560	That wasn't a note, Erin. You're doing fine. I'm sorry.
3264560	3267560	I thought I was going to get a big laugh, and I didn't. I'm just kidding. She's the best.
3267560	3268560	All right.
3268560	3271560	Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
3271560	3274560	I have the answers to this final exam.
3274560	3281560	You wouldn't even have to study. Just copy off of me, and then you can focus on being creative.
3281560	3284560	Or my name's not Phil Dorfman.
3284560	3286560	It's not. It's Matt.
3286560	3288560	Oh, Matt. Yeah, Matt. Right.
3291560	3294560	So I couldn't possibly trust you.
3295560	3296560	Look, man.
3297560	3301560	Hello, son. I'm sorry. To bother you at school, your name is actually Matt.
3301560	3303560	I should have told you that a long time ago.
3304560	3308560	Sorry. Go back to her harassing that girl over there.
3309560	3311560	Also, she's black.
3311560	3316560	Hey, I don't care. I've never had a reason to care, and I'm not going to have one today.
3316560	3320560	Okay, so just copy off of me, and then you have time to be creative,
3320560	3324560	and we could be boyfriend and girlfriend, and the world could be free of race.
3324560	3326560	We could have a little beige baby.
3329560	3334560	Well, hi. Gosh, there's so many things running through my mind.
3334560	3338560	Nine months later, push, daughter, push.
3338560	3340560	Push. Push. I'm going to...
3340560	3342560	Is that anybody else? No, I'm...
3342560	3343560	Anyone else?
3343560	3348560	Nobody in this town has won more awards for delivering babies than me.
3348560	3354560	I'm a three-time Golden Baby Award winner, and I will deliver your baby.
3356560	3361560	Oh, my God. He's coming up breach. He's coming up breach.
3363560	3367560	It's hideous! It's hideous!
3367560	3374560	Don't mix the races! Don't mix the races!
3376560	3379560	Okay, well, that went differently than...
3381560	3384560	Transparent Heart, everybody. Transparent Heart.
3384560	3387560	That did not... Aaron, that did not...
3389560	3391560	That was not the right...
3391560	3393560	Okay, let's compare notes.
3394560	3401560	My thought was that Phil slash Matt, who loved Aaron regardless of her race,
3401560	3405560	was going to have her copy off of his test for his own convenience,
3405560	3409560	his own visceral convenience, and then they were going to get caught by a teacher,
3409560	3414560	and then he was going to throw her under the bus and kind of play the race car.
3414560	3417560	So you wrote the improv scene we were going to do?
3417560	3420560	Well, I'm a fucking genius. I was writing ahead.
3420560	3424560	I mean, I certainly didn't intend to cut to the birthing of a minotaur.
3424560	3426560	Right.
3426560	3431560	It was like a cautionary tale against misedzany? What did we create?
3431560	3433560	I was saying, we haven't figured out our problems.
3433560	3440560	It's just cast a stark trenchant social commentary on the state of things now.
3440560	3443560	It's making us look at ourselves the way we actually are,
3443560	3446560	the darker version of ourselves that we actually are right now.
3446560	3451560	I have to admit, I mean, I'm white Aaron. I'm white Aaron.
3451560	3456560	No, I am. Definitely in my head about playing...
3456560	3457560	What is this look on your face?
3457560	3458560	I'm just waiting to...
3458560	3460560	Definitely in my head about playing black Aaron,
3460560	3462560	because when you're playing a character, you're like,
3462560	3465560	how is this character different from me?
3465560	3467560	But we're the same. We have the same sensibility.
3467560	3469560	This is the talkback version of the...
3469560	3470560	You ever go to a play and then...
3470560	3473560	Aaron, what's your takeaway from our little tale there?
3473560	3476560	What do we do right? What do we do wrong?
3476560	3479560	Oh, black Aaron.
3479560	3482560	I thought it was... I thought it was great.
3482560	3483560	All right.
3483560	3485560	All right, yeah.
3485560	3489560	You know why? Because as much as you, as a dominant white male,
3489560	3491560	want to control the outcome of things,
3491560	3494560	especially involving women and communication,
3494560	3496560	sometimes life takes its own course.
3496560	3500560	Only I, as a white man, know how to solve racism and sexism.
3501560	3504560	It is something I have been born with the equipment to do.
3506560	3508560	I was really excited, Dan, that you got to show everyone
3508560	3510560	what your newest fetish is,
3510560	3514560	which is we pretend that he's being born from me.
3514560	3515560	It's really exciting.
3515560	3519560	All right. Well, let's thank new human Aaron for coming up here.
3521560	3522560	Thank you.
3524560	3526560	I'm so sorry for everything.
3526560	3527560	Thank you.
3528560	3530560	I hope we can heal this scarred world.
3530560	3531560	Thank you.
3532560	3535560	Isn't she lovely? She made a sweetheart.
3538560	3540560	May... May...
3540560	3543560	The big question is, if we see her in Colorado,
3543560	3545560	then we didn't totally blow that.
3545560	3547560	Yeah, yeah, that's the good metric, yeah.
3547560	3550560	Hopefully she won't get the flu and send us the wrong signal.
3550560	3552560	That'll be like a Romeo and Juliet thing.
3552560	3554560	Like, is Aaron out in the audience?
3554560	3555560	And then she's not, and we're like,
3556560	3557560	we really fucked up.
3557560	3559560	And then we kill ourselves, and then she shows up late,
3559560	3561560	and she's like, they killed themselves,
3561560	3562560	and then she kills herself.
3562560	3565560	How did Jeff organize a firing squad that quickly?
3568560	3570560	Why is Dan Sticks in his hand?
3572560	3573560	That's a whole...
3573560	3575560	That's cross-signals, too.
3575560	3577560	Was this a group suicide,
3577560	3581560	or a ritualistic murder slash orgy?
3582560	3584560	I would dump off a bridge.
3585560	3587560	Oh, all right.
3587560	3589560	Yeah, there's a couple people who would.
3589560	3590560	It's crazy.
3590560	3592560	I don't know if it's...
3592560	3594560	I don't know if I'd recommend watching that documentary or not.
3594560	3595560	The Bridge.
3595560	3596560	No, it's prettier.
3596560	3599560	I mean, I don't know if it's really a documentary.
3599560	3602560	It feels ghoulish and freak show-ish.
3602560	3604560	I think the reason you're watching it
3604560	3607560	is because you want to watch people jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.
3607560	3609560	It should be called Yes, You Get to See People Die.
3609560	3611560	Yeah, and they kind of dress it up
3611560	3612560	like that's not what you're watching.
3612560	3614560	I watch it, and it's such the sad music,
3614560	3616560	and it shows people crying on the Golden Gate Bridge,
3616560	3618560	and then it just ends with this repetitive...
3618560	3620560	Just people plummeting.
3620560	3622560	They shot it, and so the whole time you're going,
3622560	3623560	you fucking shot it.
3623560	3624560	Come on, this isn't journalism.
3624560	3625560	And you shot it.
3625560	3626560	You could have run up and stopped them,
3626560	3628560	but they just filmed people jumping off.
3628560	3630560	Yeah, shoot a bottle rocket at them.
3630560	3632560	Because they're shooting it from way down the line.
3632560	3634560	And the thing that was the clincher was like,
3634560	3638560	okay, because they kept interviewing this one guy,
3638560	3639560	and I was like...
3639560	3641560	This guy's family.
3641560	3643560	They kept talking about him and coming back to him,
3643560	3645560	and I was like, there's nothing building here.
3645560	3646560	I'm not learning anything new.
3646560	3649560	If I find out that he just jumped off the bridge
3649560	3651560	in the coolest way,
3651560	3654560	if they just got the best shot of him committing suicide,
3654560	3655560	then I'm fucking...
3655560	3657560	That's the final word on this thing.
3657560	3659560	I was really sick to my stomach after.
3659560	3661560	I was like, why did I watch that?
3661560	3664560	It really fucked me up for a whole day.
3664560	3666560	Suicide's not the answer, Rap.
3668560	3669560	Coming up.
3672560	3674560	Yo.
3674560	3675560	Yo.
3675560	3677560	MC Life.
3677560	3679560	Coming at ya.
3679560	3681560	With a new message.
3681560	3682560	It's about to get positive.
3682560	3684560	Don't do it. Don't take it all.
3684560	3687560	Your mom and your dad gave you so much to call upon.
3687560	3689560	Study your math.
3689560	3691560	Don't drown yourself in the bath.
3691560	3693560	If you want to strangle yourself,
3693560	3695560	do it while you jerk it off.
3695560	3697560	You might like it, and then stop doing it.
3697560	3699560	And then you think you came harder.
3700560	3701560	Life.
3706560	3708560	Rhode Island.
3712560	3714560	May I ask something?
3714560	3717560	This is a really self-focused question.
3717560	3718560	From you?
3722560	3723560	Two?
3724560	3729560	Earlier, when you were asking Dan about his fetishes and stuff,
3729560	3731560	I just want to ask the audience...
3731560	3733560	This is an honest question,
3733560	3735560	and I will take whatever answer you give me,
3735560	3737560	and this is not a leading question.
3737560	3739560	I'm honestly asking you,
3739560	3741560	because I'm sitting in the back
3741560	3746560	when Jeff was really drilling Dan about what his new fetishes are.
3746560	3748560	Should I feel bad about that?
3748560	3750560	Should I feel like...
3750560	3752560	I was just fucking with him, obviously.
3752560	3755560	I know, I know, I know, but it felt...
3755560	3757560	When I was sitting back there, I was like,
3757560	3760560	is Jeff saying it in a very subtle way
3760560	3763560	that he doesn't respect our relationship?
3763560	3764560	Certainly.
3764560	3765560	Or is it? Okay.
3765560	3766560	Okay.
3766560	3767560	No, that seems perfectly...
3767560	3768560	Okay, thank you. That's why I asked.
3768560	3769560	That's why I asked.
3769560	3771560	No, I think the worst thing you can say about Jeff
3771560	3773560	is that he was trying to instigate us breaking up
3773560	3777560	by creating dynamite podcast entertainment.
3777560	3781560	I wouldn't put him past that, but he's not a gun.
3781560	3782560	I'm not trying to bring the mood down.
3782560	3784560	I was trying to shoot two arrows.
3790560	3792560	Well, I'll see you guys at D&D.
3792560	3793560	All right. Goodbye, baby.
3793560	3794560	Speaking of D&D,
3794560	3796560	we should probably bring Spencer up right now, right?
3796560	3799560	Spencer!
3807560	3808560	Oh, yeah.
3812560	3814560	His bag of holding.
3814560	3815560	His bag of holding.
3815560	3817560	He does say bag of holding.
3817560	3819560	Again, for those of you just joining us for the first time,
3819560	3821560	this is Spencer, our dungeon master,
3821560	3823560	who's been traveling with us.
3828560	3830560	Wait, where are Corey and Dave, respectively,
3830560	3831560	like in the audience?
3831560	3832560	Where are they?
3832560	3834560	I mean, they don't have to be in the audience.
3834560	3835560	Are you guys both back there?
3835560	3837560	Oh, okay. Wait, okay.
3837560	3838560	I was like wondering, like,
3838560	3841560	am I face blind or is this guy either Corey or Dave?
3841560	3843560	But this is, you know, this is just random guy.
3843560	3844560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3844560	3848560	That's how weird my, like, I have borderline prosopagnosia.
3848560	3849560	Oh, my God.
3849560	3851560	I just realized we're going really late.
3851560	3852560	What? Oh, shit.
3852560	3853560	Is Bobcat?
3853560	3854560	Bobcat just called me.
3854560	3855560	No, okay.
3855560	3856560	I just realized.
3856560	3857560	When do we have to get out of here?
3857560	3858560	Five minutes.
3858560	3859560	Five minutes, shit.
3859560	3860560	Oh, okay.
3860560	3861560	Two minutes, speed round.
3861560	3862560	I didn't know this was a bullet train show.
3862560	3863560	Yeah, sorry.
3863560	3864560	That's totally my fault.
3864560	3865560	Ten arrows.
3865560	3866560	Bad comptroller.
3866560	3867560	Oh, okay.
3867560	3868560	Well, it's a bummer.
3868560	3872560	We're sad, like, we have to get out of here to load out
3872560	3875560	so that Bobcat can load his audience in.
3875560	3877560	So we're going to put it right to the limit here.
3877560	3879560	So, Spencer, get us up to date.
3879560	3880560	You guys wake up.
3880560	3882560	You're inside of a giant beast.
3885560	3886560	Good job.
3887560	3888560	I killed a beast.
3888560	3889560	No.
3889560	3890560	Oh, shit.
3893560	3894560	So describe this beast.
3894560	3896560	What are we looking at here, Spencer?
3896560	3898560	You wake up in the wreckage of a ship.
3898560	3900560	It seems to be ripped asunder.
3900560	3903560	Although you're in a rather dark place,
3903560	3907560	there seems to be some sort of ambient light shining through.
3907560	3909560	You can see the red walls of wherever you're in
3909560	3911560	through the cracks in the ship.
3912560	3913560	Go.
3913560	3914560	I can see the what?
3914560	3917560	You can see the red walls outside of your ship.
3917560	3920560	You're obviously in some sort of red cavern.
3920560	3923560	Yeah, we got swallowed by an infinifish.
3923560	3924560	Oh, okay.
3925560	3928560	Well, for some of these guys, the Boston episode hasn't aired.
3928560	3931560	Like, it ended with some weird flashback to a nursery
3931560	3933560	around what my mom said about something called an infinifish.
3933560	3936560	And then the ship got impacted by a huge thing.
3936560	3937560	Now we're waking up inside.
3937560	3939560	So we're in the belly of the whale right now.
3939560	3940560	You might just be.
3940560	3941560	You might just be.
3941560	3942560	All right.
3944560	3947560	Well, we also learned in Brooklyn that ray of frost...
3947560	3949560	It's the shittiest spell you have.
3950560	3953560	Ray of frost is like, hey, go get me some ice.
3953560	3954560	Sorry.
3954560	3955560	Okay.
3955560	3957560	Are there squirrels or small woodland creatures
3957560	3959560	I can summon inside this infinifish?
3959560	3960560	No, they're not.
3960560	3961560	Okay, I know.
3961560	3963560	You could maybe summon an epiglottis.
3963560	3964560	Oh, yeah.
3965560	3968560	We can walk out into this...
3968560	3972560	What are we looking at if we walk outside into this enclosure?
3972560	3974560	Exiting the wreckage of the ship,
3974560	3977560	you see that you're at a bottom of a great red pit.
3977560	3980560	Inky blackness stretches onward ahead of you.
3980560	3982560	You can see globules studded on the walls
3982560	3984560	full of a green glowing fluid.
3984560	3986560	It casts light throughout the room.
3986560	3988560	You see three white-clothed figures
3988560	3991560	approach from the north, assumedly.
3991560	3995560	I yell out, hey!
3998560	4000560	They slowly approach silently.
4003560	4004560	All right, we...
4004560	4005560	Yeah.
4005560	4007560	I tried everything I could.
4008560	4011560	Use your diplomacy.
4011560	4012560	Talk to these guys.
4012560	4013560	All right.
4013560	4016560	I step forward, hands raised up,
4016560	4019560	to indicate no weapons in them,
4019560	4021560	nor no spells being cast.
4021560	4026560	And I kind of do like a fancy bow,
4026560	4029560	like I'm a fancy person.
4029560	4032560	And then I walk to them very gently,
4032560	4034560	very gently and very diplomatically.
4034560	4036560	They approach.
4036560	4039560	I see you're a fancy gentleman.
4039560	4042560	Well, this is no place for your kind.
4042560	4045560	We have a dwelling not far from here.
4045560	4046560	You'd have to stick close.
4046560	4048560	It's quite dangerous.
4048560	4050560	Who are you?
4050560	4053560	We were swallowed by the infinifish many moons ago.
4053560	4056560	We're trying to make the best of it.
4056560	4059560	Okay, well, I think you're probably good people
4059560	4062560	to go with in the short term.
4062560	4064560	Can my friends come?
4064560	4065560	Yeah.
4065560	4066560	All right.
4066560	4068560	Guys, we should follow these guys there.
4068560	4071560	Well, these guys, they've been here for many moons.
4071560	4073560	We should go find people that know how to get out of here.
4073560	4075560	Well, I mean, it's an infinifish.
4075560	4076560	They all left.
4076560	4077560	Huh?
4077560	4078560	They all left.
4078560	4079560	Of course, yeah.
4079560	4081560	That's flawed logic.
4085560	4086560	I'd say we follow them,
4086560	4088560	especially since it's got to be like a two-minute episode.
4088560	4089560	Oh, yeah.
4089560	4091560	And also, we're already over time right now.
4091560	4092560	Yeah.
4092560	4093560	So we follow them.
4093560	4094560	Cliffhanger.
4094560	4096560	Yeah, Spencer.
4096560	4099560	I'm sorry, Rhode Island.
4099560	4100560	All right, Dan.
4100560	4102560	I hate to do it to you.
4102560	4104560	We talked about killing ourselves.
4104560	4107560	Aaron thought I was trying to destroy your relationship.
4107560	4108560	I'm sorry.
4108560	4109560	No, no, no, no.
4109560	4111560	No, I'm sorry.
4111560	4113560	They're hugging and making up.
4113560	4115560	Can we get...
4117560	4121560	White or black.
4121560	4123560	Yellow or brown.
4124560	4127560	Harmatown.
4129560	4132560	I've come to a place called Rhode.
4132560	4135560	It's an island and a place that you've never known.
4135560	4140560	It's a magical realm where all your dreams can come true and be owned.
4140560	4144560	Down in Harmatown.
4144560	4147560	Saw your mama on the street.
4147560	4150560	And I came on her feet.
4151560	4154560	She's a whore that cannot be beat.
4154560	4157560	I fucked your mama in Harmatown.
4157560	4160560	And I want to fuck your mama again.
4160560	4163560	I'll give her dollars, number, and ten.
4163560	4165560	That's all she's worth.
4165560	4168560	She's a worthless person to me.
4168560	4171560	Your mama's Harmatown.
4171560	4173560	So sorry.
4173560	4175560	It's hard to improvise lyrics.
4175560	4179560	And a lot of times it results in talking about fucking your mama.
4179560	4181560	But it's not a real mama.
4181560	4185560	It's just the mama of America.
4185560	4189560	Mama of America.
4189560	4192560	Fifty states wide, mama.
4192560	4195560	District of Columbia is your pussy.
4195560	4198560	I fucked America.
4198560	4201560	President Obama, you here?
4201560	4204560	I'm gonna fuck your country without fear.
4204560	4208560	I'm gonna take ownership and thrust from my constitution.
4208560	4211560	Right to fuck you over again.
4211560	4213560	Fuck your mama.
4213560	4215560	Fuck your country.
4215560	4216560	Fuck your mama.
4216560	4218560	Fuck your country.
4218560	4223560	Fuck, fuck, fuck all the governments and all the politicians.
4223560	4226560	Fuck all the police and fuck everything.
4226560	4229560	Thank you for coming to Harmatown, everyone.
4229560	4231560	One more time.
4231560	4232560	Harmatown.
4232560	4234560	Spencer Crittenden.

4239560	4244560	Aaron's of all colors and creeds.
4244560	4245560	I'm Jeff Davis.
4245560	4250560	One more time for the mayor, Dan Harmon.
4250560	4254560	CBS pilot in Harmatown.

4256560	4260560	Everybody fucking Harmontown.
4260560	4263560	Everybody fucking Harmontown.
4263560	4265560	Fake stage dive.
4265560	4268560	We'll just kind of...
4268560	4269560	Fake...
4269560	4271560	We're all shittiest.
4271560	4274560	Stay stuck.
4274560	4276560	All right, you know what?
4276560	4279560	Everybody, we're all taking the party over to Whiskey Republic.
4279560	4280560	You want to come over there?
4280560	4281560	There's merchandise for sale.
4281560	4282560	We'll hang out.
4282560	4283560	We'll sign stuff.
4283560	4285560	We'll get Dan a real stage float when we go over there.
4285560	4287560	Whiskey Republic, everybody.
4287560	4288560	Thanks again.
4288560	4289560	We love you all.
4289560	4291560	And anybody that came from Somerville by request,
4291560	4292560	the dinner's the favorite.
4292560	4293560	You know who you are.
4293560	4296560	You'll get whatever special treatment we can afford to give you.
4296560	4298560	Emotionally, physically, anything.
4298560	4301560	I'm yours for the evening.
4302560	4303560	Thank you.
4303560	4304560	Thank you.
4304560	4305560	Thank you.
