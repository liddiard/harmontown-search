0	9000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, Harman Town is now in session.
9000	20000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
20000	36000	Wow, I don't understand. Jeff, why are all these people here? It's the Super Bowl.
36000	39000	Why is our audience here?
39000	43000	I'm assuming that they came straight from their Super Bowl parties and made it just in time.
43000	47000	We should get it out of the way, right? We should do a sports corner.
47000	62000	Sports corner, doing the sports, throwing the balls, and you know what's worse than playing sports, doing the thing.
62000	67000	It's a team action, makes you sane, got to jump up and down to the organized sports.
67000	72000	Jump, jump, yep, yep, sports.
73000	75000	Dan, let me start you off.
75000	83000	Seattle Seahawks, Pats, Pats, whatever Pats is short for.
83000	87000	I'm not going to play that game. I couldn't not get that information.
87000	93000	Okay, the New England Patriots, first impressions going into the game with all the controversy that led up to it.
93000	102000	It's a controversy. It was a weird year this year for the Super Bowl.
102000	105000	Dan, when people put gate on the name of a controversy...
105000	108000	Super Bowl gate?
108000	113000	I'm talking, of course, about the game leading up to the Patriots making it into the Super Bowl.
113000	115000	Some of their balls were under inflated.
115000	117000	Oh, there's the deflate gate.
117000	129000	I did see some of that. I saw in Craig Ferguson or something that they did a funny video where people were spiking footballs and then they photoshopped them, just staying put.
129000	134000	Somebody said that they were under inflating the balls and that made them easier to catch.
134000	136000	I got that. We're all on the same page.
136000	139000	So going in, hopefully they had that ironed out.
139000	145000	What did you think about the...let's go right to the end of the game, some pretty amazing plays towards the end there.
145000	159000	I mean, there was so much...I mean, what Tuckerson did in the 11th hour, you watch a whole game like that, point by point, quarter by quarter, and you're watching...
159000	166000	Usually, as you know, football is a game of yardage and that's not always a fun thing to watch.
166000	168000	It's not always a dramatic thing to watch.
168000	175000	In baseball, it's like, oh, he popped a fly to the third, and it's a big deal.
175000	178000	Every batter that comes up has an opportunity to create a story.
178000	182000	In football, it's a team effort. It's the long lost American dream.
182000	191000	You've got a quarterback, you've got a receiver, you've got a linebacker, you've got a fatback, you've got a wide receiver in case the line receiver fails.
191000	201000	The quarterbacker has to throw the ball, and the point is yardage, and it's an accumulation of that yardage, and so we watched that happen tonight.
201000	216000	It's a Super Bowl, and so a lot of people were turned off by that, but at the end of the game, at the very end of the game, dramatic turn of events.
216000	222000	The guy ran, and the guy caught the ball.
222000	225000	It did, but then they were right about to score.
225000	232000	They were right in the end zone, and the guy right before the end zone, and the other guys did what they're supposed to do.
232000	234000	What they're supposed to do.
234000	235000	Correct.
235000	238000	But there was a question about whether they did it right.
238000	241000	They did it right.
241000	243000	They did it right.
243000	246000	There was a question, but the answer was yes, they did it right.
246000	252000	There was a question of whether or not the guy that had caught the ball had caught it right.
252000	253000	Right.
253000	262000	There's always a question about that, which is why they have the referees out there on the field, and in that particular instance, the answer to the question, did he catch it right, was yes.
262000	264000	He caught it right.
264000	267000	So it didn't matter what the other people did.
267000	269000	What do you think about the halftime performance?
269000	273000	Oh, those musicians.
273000	277000	I haven't seen them in what, 10, 11 years?
277000	279000	A few of them a little bit longer than that.
279000	280000	No.
280000	282000	And the combination of those musicians.
282000	284000	Correct.
284000	289000	Who would have thought that those musicians would appear in that combination?
289000	295000	Were you expecting a kind of early 90s-ish black rock and roll?
295000	298000	No, of course I wasn't expecting that.
298000	300000	It's halftime at the Super Bowl.
300000	304000	I'm expecting nothing more than the president of football to come out and throw candy.
304000	309000	Who would have known that superstar from the mid-90s?
309000	312000	Kind of supermodel dating.
312000	314000	Cindy Crawford.
314000	317000	Cynthia Bloomberg.
317000	319000	Madonna.
319000	321000	It's a guy, it's a guy.
321000	323000	Perry Farrell.
323000	327000	Perry was the last name of the girl that was the headliner in it.
328000	329000	What?
329000	330000	Katy Perry.
330000	331000	Perry Perry.
331000	332000	Katy Perry.
332000	333000	Katy Perry.
333000	334000	You said Katy Perry.
334000	335000	Katy Perry.
335000	336000	Okay.
336000	337000	Don't applaud that.
337000	338000	He said though.
338000	339000	Katy Perry.
339000	343000	I thought mixing Katy Perry with those guys, those crazy guys is crazy.
343000	346000	She's like such a pop sugar pop bubblegum.
346000	347000	Mr. Can I have trouble?
347000	351000	Just when you're thinking like I'm being fed some top 40 bullshit.
351000	354000	I don't want to eat bubblegum for a living.
354000	356000	I'm a working man.
356000	365000	Then in comes the vroom vroom vroom, the fucking hard driving, over driven fucking six strings
365000	368000	of that fucking band that shouldn't be with Katy Perry.
368000	370000	He was mostly just kind of a solo guy.
370000	373000	Fucking like Jethro Tom.
373000	375000	As I said before black gentleman.
375000	376000	Black?
376000	380000	You know kind of American woman.
380000	382000	He covered that one time.
382000	383000	Remember he loved that.
383000	386000	Mr. Cab driver and he was pretty big.
386000	387000	I just laid.
387000	390000	E.B.K. came out.
390000	391000	Lenny.
391000	392000	Lenny.
392000	393000	Lenny.
393000	394000	Lenny.
394000	395000	Lenny.
395000	396000	Lenny.
396000	403000	John Steinbeck came out and fucking right out.
403000	404000	Black.
404000	405000	Black guy named Lenny.
405000	406000	Black Lenny.
406000	407000	Lenny Kravitz.
407000	410000	That's all you had to say.
410000	411000	Black Lenny came out.
411000	413000	I call him Black Lenny.
413000	416000	Who would have thought he'd be with Katy Perry?
416000	417000	That's crazy.
417000	421000	I don't have a reason to question my consumerist lifestyle.
421000	424000	Not if these two are hooking up in the 50 yard line.
424000	427000	And then the female rapper came out towards the end.
427000	428000	Oh my God.
428000	431000	When Pharrell came out.
431000	432000	Holler.
432000	437000	Holler.
437000	439000	Look I didn't know who it was until she said that.
439000	440000	Her name was on the TV.
440000	441000	I would not have known.
441000	442000	Oh is it Lady?
442000	443000	A lady rapper?
443000	444000	Little Kim.
444000	447000	I think a little older.
447000	450000	Natalie.
450000	453000	Rapper.
453000	454000	Lil Johnson.
454000	455000	If it's not a hit it's a.
455000	461000	It's a Missy Elliott came out.
461000	462000	Amazing.
462000	464000	And it's like not only.
464000	467000	I mean talk about ending the culture war and getting back to shopping.
467000	471000	Like it was a great great halftime.
471000	479000	I just I thought it's a it's that time of year when we all realize there's nothing going wrong.
479000	483000	And then and then whoever won one it was either the bird people or the fucking aqua people.
483000	485000	I don't know.
485000	495000	And it was the important thing is that is that the right team won because it was the team that the corporation that owned it spent the right amount of money.
495000	516000	Aggregating dumb people from colleges around the country who had been passed up through corrupt systems and assembled into a team so that you could overcharge people to watch and generally train people for jingoism in arenas and around the world.
516000	519000	What was your favorite commercial of all because that's always a big thing.
519000	525000	I actually know about the commercials because because people were tweeting me and going you got to see the Liam Neeson one.
525000	526000	The Liam Neeson was in a commercial.
526000	533000	The thing that the two commercials that I saw and I don't know if it was because there were two commercials I saw were for apps.
533000	536000	They were for like like gaming apps.
536000	537000	That was weird.
537000	540000	Liam Neeson did an ad for Clash of Clans.
540000	545000	And and then there was another ad I got sent that was some game of war.
545000	547000	Some lady game of war is a thing.
547000	548000	It was just another thing.
548000	551000	I like like I don't know.
551000	554000	But did Bud Light do anything.
554000	557000	There seemed to be a lot of commercials about fathers neglecting their children.
557000	561000	And then there was a really a really horrifying one by nationwide insurance.
561000	566000	I think about your baby is going to be murdered by your negligence around the house.
566000	568000	And it was just like don't let your kid die.
568000	570000	We'll save you from that.
570000	576000	I mean if we haven't figured out by now that that's what insurance is is a protection racket.
576000	580000	I remember when I was like 20 years old an envelope that I got in the mail.
580000	585000	There was literally a photo of Christopher Reeves post accident.
585000	589000	Christopher Reeves on the envelope and said don't let what happened to me happen to you.
589000	592000	And it was an ad for an insurance company.
592000	597000	That's exactly what the mafia does in mafia movies.
597000	600000	Except they have the courtesy to not involve the guy.
600000	605000	Like it would just be a guy in a suit going don't let what happened to Christopher Reeves happen to you.
605000	606000	It'd be a shame.
606000	611000	It'd be a shame for that to happen.
611000	614000	It's amazing to me that we haven't caught on to this yet.
614000	622000	That our laws that protect us from the mafia actually if you actually applied them in an objective sense would you should go after insurance companies.
622000	623000	Here's another thing.
623000	624000	Guess what?
624000	626000	Airline companies are a cartel.
626000	628000	Look up the word cartel.
628000	629000	Cartel.
629000	633000	I know you think the word cartel means Mexican drug dealer.
633000	637000	Cartel is a collection of companies.
637000	642000	A collection of profit seeking groups who are supposed to be in competition who aren't in competition.
642000	651000	Who work with each other to minimize the consumer service and maximize their own profits.
651000	654000	Airline companies cartel antitrust laws.
654000	656000	Hey I learned about him in high school too.
656000	657000	Not applicable.
657000	660000	Haven't applied them in the last 30 years.
660000	662000	What the fuck happened to antitrust.
662000	668000	You're supposed to break up any company that is imposing any threat to the competition.
668000	671000	Key component to fucking capitalism.
671000	672000	Competition.
672000	673000	Competition.
673000	676000	No one is supposed to be safe in capitalism.
676000	677000	Nobody.
677000	683000	Even the guy at the very top the guy that sells you all the candy should be looking over one shoulder.
683000	688000	Every time Willy Wonka starts his car he should be like I hope Snickers doesn't get me.
688000	690000	They're not supposed to have secret meetings.
690000	693000	They're not supposed to share like information.
693000	697000	They're not supposed to have all the same board members on their board of directors.
697000	700000	Fuck you people.
700000	706000	I was in an Alaska airline flight and they stopped providing blankets and it's cold flying up there.
706000	709000	I bet you could get them for a five dollar upgrade fee.
709000	713000	There was an article in the New Yorker or whatever I tweeted.
713000	717000	It's a fucking expose of a goddamn cartel.
717000	722000	JetBlue just ended its hey you're a human being you want to get somewhere.
722000	725000	Let's just give you JetBlue just ended it.
725000	727000	JetBlue was seeing profits.
727000	731000	They were a profit seeing airline.
731000	733000	They were doing fine.
733000	737000	JetBlue's gimmick was I believe there was no first class on JetBlue.
737000	743000	Is that the case or all the seats were kind of equally all right generally like it's kind of nice to fly JetBlue.
743000	749000	Let's just try this like let's try this as an experiment and the experiment was working fine.
749000	751000	They weren't going to go out of business.
751000	753000	Nothing was going to happen to them.
753000	761000	They stopped it anyway because the stockholders in JetBlue said this obsession with pleasing the customer.
761000	763000	We don't want to buy your stock anymore.
763000	765000	You are obsessed with pleasing the customer.
765000	778000	And the way you the way you make a profitable airline is you slowly reduce the amount of fucking human space that you have in coach economy whatever the fuck you call it.
778000	779000	Pencil plus.
779000	785000	Now there's ninety five classes and they're all of them like are shrinking down.
785000	789000	I have to I compulsively fly first class because they got me.
790000	796000	But my like even in first class white people probably platinum edition like first class is shrinking too.
796000	801000	There's a there's a sometimes there's a room upstairs I think where everyone's in an egg like an egg.
803000	805000	It's like secret class or something.
805000	807000	I'm sure that's getting bigger and bigger.
807000	814000	It's like the case you're flying with one of the seven hundred people that has all the wealth in the United States.
814000	823000	But but but the their business model is to shrink and shrink and shrink everything that you have as an airline passenger.
823000	825000	And so that and offer you.
826000	828000	Oh gee oh did you want Perk Plus.
828000	829000	Did you want to.
829000	832000	Did you want to put your feet out of somewhere.
833000	834000	That's not behind your head.
835000	837000	Oh that you're a Perk Blusser.
837000	838000	Oh did you want to.
838000	840000	Did you want to Perk plus or plus or like.
840000	846000	And they and they just like move you like like boarding first and being allowed to have a backpack and.
846000	851000	And did you want to bring Q tips and they sell everything to you as like this upgrade.
851000	853000	It's fucked up man.
853000	855000	And they agree on it with each other.
855000	859000	They all have to have meetings about this and they go like OK how many centimeters leg room.
859000	860000	Do.
860000	862000	Are we calling luxury.
862000	866000	Because if they don't agree on that someone could fuck up really bad by six centimeters.
866000	868000	That makes a huge difference on a nine hour.
868000	870000	Virgin America or Virgin Atlantic.
870000	872000	They seem like they're they're they're a nice airline.
872000	874000	Yeah I don't know where Virgin Falls.
874000	875000	I like them a lot.
875000	877000	They seem like they're kind of doing their own kind of groovy thing.
877000	878000	I don't know.
878000	880000	But my eyes on you airlines.
882000	884000	That's the that's the moral of that story.
885000	887000	Oh do you want to do a new segment.
887000	895000	It's called things that I say off the cuff that I swear like if somebody on parenthood said it like.
896000	901000	It could be like an amazing piece of dialogue.
901000	907000	I because I've been experimenting going through our new because I can't use licensed music anymore.
907000	910000	I found this today in hopes that maybe this might happen.
910000	911000	OK.
911000	912000	OK.
912000	913000	It's all right.
913000	917000	Things I say things I think I said tonight just while getting dressed with Aaron that I'm like wow.
917000	920000	I sound like I sound like an NBC character.
920000	921000	Are you ready.
921000	922000	Yeah.
923000	925000	Every once in a while.
931000	932000	It's short.
932000	944000	So Aaron and I were talking about beards and and I was talking about how I saw some red carpet lady fashion lady on the red carpet say like well you can expect a lot of beards this year from the men.
944000	946000	And I was like yeah I've had a beard for a long time.
946000	947000	I came over.
947000	954000	I was finally doing beards and Aaron and I were talking about the beards and like what what is that culturally.
954000	958000	And Aaron was like like I don't want to put words in Aaron's mouth and it's a hot button topic.
958000	960000	So I'm not putting words in Aaron's mouth.
960000	961000	This is what I remember hearing.
961000	967000	Aaron was talking about how like is that a thing that's motivated from the feminine side like like like based on what women want.
967000	973000	She was talking about is it a possible reaction to over metrosexuality.
973000	977000	Like are we you know like the women are like craving like something else.
977000	981000	So we were taught we were having that conversation in the privacy of our own home.
981000	987000	And and then she said yeah it's definitely it's definitely a heterosexual trend.
987000	988000	The beard.
989000	990000	It's not a gay trend.
990000	993000	And then she went in the bathroom and then I was standing alone in the bedroom.
994000	995000	And I went.
996000	998000	A gay trend.
998000	1001000	Imagine imagine being in charge of figuring out what those are.
1001000	1004000	Talk about finding a needle in a needle stack.
1005000	1006000	Because because.
1009000	1012000	Because to me gay people are a trend.
1015000	1016000	All right.
1016000	1021000	I'm having a real quick on the beard things I've been grassing about the beard business.
1021000	1029000	Because I live in like Los Feliz which is near Silver Lake which is the Williamsburg which is the hip neighborhood of the city that has the hip neighborhoods.
1029000	1038000	And I was in a restaurant in Brooklyn like a few months a month or two ago having brunch and there were 15 guys in there including me.
1038000	1043000	14 of those guys have the same fucking Hammurabi big ass down to their fucking collarbone beard.
1043000	1044000	Whoa.
1044000	1045000	Yeah.
1045000	1047000	And it's like you can't all have the same fucking beard.
1047000	1048000	That's crazy.
1048000	1050000	If you walked in the room you're all wearing the same hat.
1050000	1052000	You're crazy people.
1053000	1055000	I just like and I told you so.
1055000	1059000	Like I mean everything I do like 10 years later everybody starts doing it.
1061000	1063000	You were the last to get a podcast though.
1063000	1064000	That's true.
1065000	1067000	But now I'm going.
1067000	1068000	Now I got a video podcast.
1068000	1073000	I skimmed a couple of articles that people sent me because they know how much I have a beef about this whole beard craze.
1073000	1075000	And the phrase lumber sexual.
1075000	1076000	And it's like guys wearing.
1076000	1077000	Lumber sexual.
1078000	1083000	And they have like they wear the plaid shirts and they have that they have the beards.
1083000	1091000	And it's a reaction to the not just women's need to have men that are more masculine but men's need to reclaim masculinity from it.
1091000	1093000	That's what that was where I immediately went.
1093000	1105000	But any woman that told me oh no women are women kind of define you know what women say men an attractive man looks like like you got to believe under the surface.
1105000	1107000	That's what's like we do.
1107000	1108000	We'll do.
1108000	1113000	It's a weird it's a weird dance we have where it's like men's gimmick is like I don't give a shit.
1113000	1116000	But and that that's sort of a staple of masculinity too.
1117000	1128000	And but but like obviously women are cracking the whip like the sexual reproduction it all of the changes are queued by the female side.
1128000	1131000	Like that is a that is as old as plant life.
1131000	1154000	Like like when we divided from a sexual organisms into a male and female the only thing that's consistent between like like all the species from from when we were flowers until what we are now is basically that the reason it speeds up Darwinian selection is because it like compounds it with half of the species dictates how you get to the egg.
1154000	1167000	And that half of the species kind of tends to that's why you see on those nature shows like these the bird is like going like what the fuck is the bird doing like it has to do like nine hundred things in order to just get in here.
1167000	1169000	It has to grow iridescent feathers.
1169000	1174000	Yeah. And like the lock horned beetles and they did like there's all this weird shit they have to do.
1174000	1177000	And it's like some of it is like an odd like random thing.
1177000	1186000	And it's like it's because there's so much energy coming out of if you just endow if you divide your species in half and endow one half with the green light that that is.
1186000	1190000	And that's not sexism that is that is as old as vegetation.
1191000	1196000	Drew Carey used to joke that every guy cuts their hair like they like they had it when they were getting laid all the time.
1196000	1201000	But that's that's that's that's why you look at George Lucas and it's like yeah guess what happened.
1202000	1204000	I'm going to make a nice movie.
1204000	1206000	You're just looking at his pompadour.
1206000	1215000	It's like yeah like George George you have you could get your haircut by a like a thousand robots every morning.
1215000	1219000	Like he can have a nano scissors injected into his hair follicles.
1219000	1220000	George.
1220000	1224000	George Lucas could afford to have like the perfect haircut for sure.
1224000	1226000	As far as he's concerned I think he has that.
1226000	1227000	Yes exactly.
1227000	1231000	Because because that's the haircut he had that's the haircut.
1231000	1237000	He had the night that something happened to him sexually that that he doesn't connect to American graffiti.
1237000	1240000	But he's like oh yeah she really liked me.
1242000	1250000	I heard another thing and I did not follow up on this and keeping with last week's theme of unverifiable facts that we don't know anything about.
1250000	1252000	But we must make other people Google.
1253000	1263000	Is that there was apparently I heard there was a reaction among the bear community like the bearded gay gentleman who are you know the little heavier like bearded like the.
1263000	1264000	Harmons.
1264000	1265000	Harmons.
1266000	1267000	They did not get that from you.
1267000	1268000	The bear culture.
1268000	1269000	Oh no no no they had it.
1269000	1270000	OK.
1270000	1275000	But like they're apparently like they feel like they're being co-opted by a bunch of straight is going out there and dressing up like bears.
1276000	1277000	They'll be all right.
1277000	1278000	They're bears.
1279000	1280000	They're fine.
1281000	1282000	We in the bear.
1282000	1283000	Do we have any bears here.
1284000	1286000	Any self identifying bears.
1286000	1287000	Yeah.
1289000	1292000	Well now that we know you're just kidding it's weird for you to go yeah.
1294000	1295000	It should have been.
1296000	1297000	Yeah.
1298000	1300000	I always say I.
1300000	1302000	I've met bears.
1302000	1303000	I feel.
1307000	1308000	I like I like bears.
1308000	1309000	I like that idea.
1309000	1310000	Yeah.
1310000	1324000	When I was in Palm Springs for for New Year's Eve I forgot my swim trunks at home back in L.A. and so I went to this place to go by him and I went to this place called Game Art USA which is by its own admission America's favorite gay superstar.
1325000	1326000	And they sell.
1326000	1333000	They sell among other things really good bathing suits also lots of cock rings and lube and like fancy underwear and stuff.
1334000	1341000	So I was I thought it'd be funny if I went back to the party because we're all doing shopping for this big New Year's Eve party is going to happen and a bunch of people are going to come.
1341000	1342000	I didn't know.
1342000	1346000	And so I bought you know we all got snacks and there's food and there's booze and there's all this stuff.
1347000	1357000	So I wanted to find that they have these little cock rings that are that look like lifesavers a little bit bigger than that with a jelly like kind of stretchy little jelly things and they come in little plastic lifesaver wrappers.
1357000	1359000	And so I thought I just they're really like they're not expensive.
1359000	1368000	I just buy a big bunch of them put them in a bowl and have those next to like the pretzels and shit and they'll be like you can have cock rings because everyone's going to come with couples more or less to this party.
1368000	1369000	I thought okay for the cock rings.
1370000	1372000	So I asked the gentleman behind the counter at Game Art.
1372000	1374000	Do you have those little jelly cock rings.
1374000	1379000	All they have is really high concept looking cybernetic like Shadowrun cock rings.
1379000	1383000	I didn't I did not know how to drink.
1383000	1384000	All right.
1384000	1385000	Oh I'll keep talking.
1386000	1388000	So I said do you have those little gel ones.
1388000	1391000	He goes no we're out of those are so great though.
1391000	1392000	I go.
1392000	1397000	Do you know a store like because it's one little strip there that's all these like gay bars and stores and like fashion places.
1397000	1399000	If you go down to bear wear.
1400000	1401000	I'm like where's bear wear.
1401000	1403000	He's like it's just two rows down.
1405000	1406000	I go into bear wear.
1406000	1407000	It was the fucking best.
1407000	1408000	Guess what's in bear wear.
1408000	1415000	A bunch of the most adorable bear couples is walking around buying putting like holding up clothes on a hanger and holding it up to their boyfriends.
1415000	1422000	And like it was buying like a little like little outfits and like scarves and things and I'm up there just talking cock rings with the top breasts.
1422000	1424000	And it was it was really nice.
1424000	1426000	I really enjoyed my time at bear wear.
1426000	1428000	Also I took the cock rings to the party.
1429000	1431000	Three of them instantly were gone.
1432000	1433000	And no one was talking.
1433000	1436000	And I think I found out later on that two of them were gone.
1436000	1440000	The girlfriend had taken them for the boyfriend because there was going to be lots of drinking involved.
1440000	1443000	They want you know a little enhancement later on down the line.
1444000	1451000	I'd like to I mean I kind of think maybe a later episode but like I want to understand the cock ring concept.
1451000	1453000	So I'll explain it all to you in a moment.
1457000	1460000	One of the cock rings was out out of the wrapper next to the bowl.
1460000	1461000	I'm like who did this.
1461000	1462000	The guy's like I thought it was candy.
1468000	1476000	I'd like to understand cock rings and I'd like to understand the bear community if there is you know there's if there's a bear Harman town out there.
1477000	1479000	We must. I'd like to think we have a few bear fans out there.
1480000	1485000	It'd be nice. I sometimes feel like we somehow marginalized the marginalized on our show.
1486000	1494000	I feel like the bears do a pretty good job of saying like like you have a store called Bearware and in there everybody looked like exactly what I wanted bears to all look like.
1494000	1495000	It was really cool.
1496000	1499000	Frankly I'd like to see more black people in the audience.
1500000	1504000	And I'd like to see more gay people but you can't see them as well.
1504000	1522000	But we we often ask like who's gay and it's like I know I just want I want you know let's throw some ladies in there too like I don't like I'd like to after black people and gay people in keeping with the American tradition.
1522000	1537000	Gay people were president. I just I feel like we're doing something wrong. I feel like I cut this silhouette of some kind of like Belusian like figure.
1538000	1546000	It's not what I mean to do. I know I'm ignorant. I know I'm clumsy but I love I love all people and I wish I wish we had more black Armenians.
1547000	1555000	Makes me feel like we're doing something wrong. Yeah. If you're black and you're out there. Well then you're out there. You're so you're fine.
1557000	1562000	And if you're black and you're out there I don't want to sound racist but do you know other black people.
1563000	1573000	Could you tell them to come here. Are any of your best friends black. Right. That's the hell. Now I'm racist for asking you if you have black friends because you're black. I don't want to do that.
1573000	1577000	If you're black and you're out there. Thank you. That's the. Thank you.
1581000	1588000	What's your name over there. Jamal. Fucking. Cha Ching.
1588000	1606000	Jamal indeed. But can we. I mean that's but that's the thing like all his friends pointing at him like that's that's that's the way like that's that that's why. That's why they know. That's why they don't come.
1607000	1617000	They don't they don't want to get sucked into my black hole. My white hole. His community does have a large black audience. Do you know. I don't know. I don't know.
1618000	1628000	How do you measure that. Do you get a lot of black people tweeting you and saying I love your show. No. Rick and Rick and Morty. I think Adult Swim has a larger black audience.
1628000	1652000	So a lot of this is going to sound crazy and I what I don't I don't believe anything about this. I'm only repeating what seems to be the case but it seems like it seems like a black audience is like animation a lot like they Adult Swim has like a black audience and Rick and Morty like I like community like episodes will go.
1653000	1664000	And I'll just I'll look at the tweets but then when an episode of Rick and Morty is airing like there's a lot more like like like like a face that you just I just go like man that guy man I wish he was my friend.
1665000	1676000	Just with a tweet that's like this motherfucker just said butters a disease or something. I don't know like like they'll like like quote like a thing but they'll kind of quote it and look sort of a street language.
1677000	1689000	And it validates me. So black people come on down next Sunday and keep watching Rick and Morty and I love you too.
1690000	1702000	All right. So moving on to a couple more things. So obviously I was right in my my predictions about the Jurassic Park 9 whatever the park is open and I'm not I wasn't psychic.
1703000	1707000	I had heard reports that Chris Pratt is playing a Raptor trainer in the movie.
1708000	1711000	Does he go out like a quarterback at the end with a bunch of Raptors and they're all going to go.
1712000	1731000	He certainly does. He certainly does. In the new in the newest trailer it's becoming very clear that he that he trained that he trains Raptors are living and he hangs out with them and he loves them and then like there's this big dinosaur they've made that's like a big they shouldn't have made this big dinosaur.
1732000	1742000	And then he in the in this new trailer he's saying he goes like we got to go out there with everything we got and it cuts to him on the four wheeler with a flock of the last Raptors.
1743000	1747000	Everything we got includes his trained Raptors. Did they say this time the girls are clever.
1750000	1758000	It's just pretty amazing. There's nothing to it. I did like the I mean the fact that they had to show it to you. I would like to have not seen it in the trailer.
1758000	1768000	But there's a Jurassic Park Sea World and a giant giant Kraken comes out of the comes out of the ocean and eats of like an orca hanging from a string or something like that.
1769000	1771000	Which by the way I don't believe would be a part of the real Jurassic Park.
1774000	1777000	Which parts of it did you buy as real parts of the dress.
1778000	1793000	Well if there's reptiles that are ancient that are walking on earth it's like I don't think that a park is going to put their money into a tank so big that a gigantic the creatures in the sea are already prehistoric sharks are prehistoric.
1794000	1803000	Like whales are basically prehistoric like they're fucking old and giant and it's neat to watch him jump out of water. But there wasn't a thing like you know a mega little googler boobler.
1804000	1805000	Now you're being racist.
1807000	1814000	Guess what's last on your list. If you go to Jurassic Park you're not going to go to the fucking water tank.
1815000	1820000	How are they going to get the insurance companies to sign off after the first Jurassic Park. Like we got it all figured out.
1820000	1830000	This is a new world that's the money Jack. It's the like what do you mean. Are you going to go see it. I'm not going to go see anything. I'm 42.
1831000	1835000	I will wait the three weeks until it's on my wristwatch.
1838000	1846000	You don't go out to the theater anymore. Go if it's Valentine's Day maybe I'll go see it. But you know Paul Rudd better be in it or.
1847000	1850000	All right. So go see it.
1851000	1856000	You never never feel like oh this is a movie that's going to be better on a giant screen. I want to go see this on a large screen.
1857000	1862000	The last time we tried that was Monuments Men. I don't think we've been to a theater since.
1863000	1864000	Like all right.
1865000	1867000	Stealing Hitler's art was only going to be great on a big screen.
1867000	1879000	I'm just saying I'm not movies are movies are for kids like going to see movies are for kids and then as the kids get you know they parlay their parents money into a new support system for themselves.
1880000	1885000	Eventually you buy a screen on your wall and then you wear a bathrobe and you watch the movie on your wall.
1886000	1888000	These guys know what I'm talking about.
1890000	1893000	Yeah you live in a little shitty apartment you go to movies.
1894000	1896000	But you dream of this.
1898000	1902000	You dream a rock in the fucking like the boiler room down here.
1903000	1904000	For the non-visual listener.
1905000	1911000	Walking naked around a mansion of barfing and puking and I don't know why barfing and puking.
1912000	1913000	I meant to say burping and pooping.
1917000	1918000	It's not far off man.
1920000	1923000	You want to be Jim Morrison you want to be what am I Howard Hughes.
1923000	1924000	You want to.
1925000	1928000	You get the big screen the wealth distribution you know you see that chart.
1929000	1931000	Oh everybody's got more money as you think.
1932000	1934000	You get older and you want that you want that money.
1935000	1936000	You want that big screen in your house.
1937000	1938000	We spent some money.
1939000	1941000	We meaning you spent some money getting all these cameras up and get the live stream going on.
1942000	1944000	Why can't we kill this cricket that's been here plaguing us.
1946000	1948000	The only thing that has one cricket that never goes away.
1949000	1950000	He's my conscience.
1954000	1956000	But how could he listen to you if he never shuts up.
1957000	1963000	He's telling me just like he said he's only saying one thing over and over again in case I ever listen which is like you're supposed to be at work.
1965000	1967000	Your show needs help.
1968000	1969000	Are you way behind schedule.
1970000	1971000	Of course I'm behind schedule.
1972000	1973000	Talk about that.
1974000	1978000	All right last thing last thing on my last thing on my thing.
1978000	1982000	I I I really recommend everybody watch this show Empire.
1983000	1984000	OK it's on Fox.
1985000	1989000	It's a show about Terrence Howard plays a hip hop record label mogul.
1990000	1991000	It's like a dynasty.
1992000	1994000	Our friend N.T. called it Black Dynasty.
1995000	1997000	It's it's he's black.
1998000	1999000	He can call it that.
2000000	2002000	I he's black and he stopped coming to our show.
2003000	2004000	Yeah I see.
2005000	2007000	Jamal please move up front.
2008000	2009000	Next week.
2010000	2011000	We're trying.
2012000	2013000	Tell us what we're doing wrong.
2015000	2018000	But it's a it's a empire is it's it's just a mate.
2019000	2023000	It's I don't know it's like a perfect storm of like like the I don't know we'll just watch it.
2024000	2025000	Watch the pilot.
2026000	2028000	It takes you 40 minutes to watch the pilot of Empire.
2029000	2031000	The dad is the mogul.
2032000	2033000	He's he's running a record label.
2034000	2035000	It's established immediately.
2036000	2038000	He's he's a record producer.
2039000	2041000	Sorry to get a little vodka off my mustache.
2042000	2044000	He they they all Jamal that can be yours next week.
2046000	2056000	The pilot opens on him sitting in like basically a throne like a cushioned throne overseeing a chantous singing in the into the microphone in the in the V.O. booth.
2057000	2058000	And she's like hell.
2059000	2064000	Singing to sing in a song some R&B song and it goes like stop it stop it.
2065000	2071000	And then he presses the mic button and goes like I need you to sing as if you just found out you are going to die.
2072000	2073000	And then she's like.
2076000	2085000	And then and then as she's singing it intercuts from her singing to him thinking about the fact that earlier today he was in a hospital getting his hospital test results.
2085000	2087000	So we're already knowing that he's going to die.
2088000	2094000	But then he goes in the booth and he goes like all right hold on and he goes in the booth and he goes like how you doing.
2095000	2099000	And she's like fine and he's like do you remember when your brother got shot.
2101000	2103000	Sounds like a real bully.
2104000	2105000	He's not a good man.
2106000	2109000	Sing to him and then and then of course he goes back and then she's like.
2111000	2113000	I'm not doing a good impression.
2115000	2118000	But of course she sings really well and it's like that is and it's like that.
2119000	2124000	That's the first three minutes of Empire and it's like that just so you just so you now know what a record producer does for a living.
2125000	2130000	If he's good if he gets results and emotionally terrorizes people.
2131000	2133000	And so then they keep flashing back to the life.
2134000	2135000	So like I don't want to spoil it all.
2136000	2142000	I'm telling you just watch the pilot because it's like the thing about the show is like you're never watching one scene for more than one minute.
2142000	2150000	The show is not like it's it's it's it's Dallas would be like eight minutes of two women about to pull each other's hair by the end of the episode.
2151000	2152000	Like it would set it up the whole time.
2153000	2155000	This is like one minute one minute one minute one minute.
2156000	2171000	There's like eight locations and like this this matriarch cookie who gets out of prison and the pilot goes back and forth between all the eight locations around the clock and and it's just stirring shit up because she of course the company was built on her back and she she went to prison.
2172000	2177000	But the dad does it I'll say nothing more about the show and then you make your decision of whether you want to watch it or not.
2178000	2199000	But in the one of the flashbacks to the 90s when the gangster the patriarch who founded the label who used to be a gangster rapper who previous to that was a real gangster and one of the flashbacks he's wearing a do rag in his one bedroom apartments living room and he's got one baby on his arm.
2199000	2221000	And there's three sons in the in the show and then the the gay son because one of those three sons is gay and the idea is that one of his three sons has to take over the record label because he's dying of ALS but he's not telling anybody with his gay son comes in the living room as gay sons do.
2222000	2242000	Wearing high heel shoes and with a scarf around his head going on and like swishing around and going like look at me like a six year old boy but I you here's how you know I'm gay and and the and the dad gets so infuriated he scoops the sun up takes him outside and puts him in the garbage.
2243000	2252000	Puts his son in a garbage can he throws his his gay son away in the garbage and puts the lid over him.
2253000	2256000	That's a shame people throwing away a perfectly good black boy like that.
2257000	2264000	So I mean it's saying if you're if you're interested in drama maybe tune into Empire and check it out.
2264000	2270000	There's only twelve episodes that's so specific that has to be based in true anecdotal because I was so fascinated with it.
2271000	2279000	Yeah I've heard rumors that one of the writers or actors like had that experience that that happened to them but but I mean amazing.
2280000	2288000	That's horrifying. So watch Empire. I think how many episodes are there already. I think there's like thirteen I'm three in and it's it doesn't slow down.
2288000	2294000	It's you know it's it's it's pretty fun. So just just watch it.
2295000	2302000	Jamal if you watch it don't. That's racist to ask him. It's racist to ask him. No it's not. It's it's racist to not be able to ask that.
2308000	2315000	I can't believe that you're sitting way back. The lights are on you. I seem that he is the kind of guy that can handle that sort of question.
2315000	2327000	It's racist to say you can't see him. I can't see the white people next to him either. Okay all right. It's it's if I if I can't how do I know they're white people.
2329000	2336000	If I could speak for Jamal for a second. That's racist. I'll take that risk. Okay.
2337000	2345000	I'm going to speak on Jamal's behalf for one second. You know we could just bring him up. No no no no. Too dangerous.
2348000	2354000	This is come on. We can't have energy. Yeah. You all heard the trash can story.
2355000	2364000	I'm sure mom speaking as Jamal for a second. I wish tomorrow I could wake up and spend an entire day from waking up till I go to bed.
2365000	2372000	Not not being my friend's black friend. Just want to be their friend. I just want to be Jamal.
2373000	2378000	Jamal do you want to come up and tell us if that's true. Can you come up.
2384000	2402000	I only I only downloaded a few new songs. That was an accident. It was that or the new Shadow Run theme. I have very little to choose from.
2404000	2413000	I meant it. All right. Well I mean how accurate are we. You actually think 100% accurate. Yeah. You would. You wish.
2414000	2423000	You knew what it was like to not think about race. It's just like I don't know. I see other people around like they're hanging out with their friends.
2424000	2435000	I'm like that's cool but like I don't want to explain it like I just want to. I just want to be white honestly. All right. Good night folks.
2445000	2449000	You just made Dan's dreams come true.
2453000	2470000	I'd say you just want to be white or have everyone in the world suddenly become black or any other any other means by which we could erase this concept which seems to be an artificial conceit so that so that it doesn't eclipse every conversation every every moment.
2471000	2475000	Or were you making fun of me when you said when you said what you said. I was just making fun of you.
2478000	2488000	Because you're so we've entered a generation where you're not you're not thinking about that at all. You know you don't care. I'm just I'm just dragging dragging you down by it by thinking about it. Yes.
2490000	2496000	So we're just we're just waiting for me to die. That's good though. That's a problem that solves itself. That's good.
2497000	2501000	All right. Well what do you what else you want to talk about. You plug in a book or.
2504000	2506000	I have a mixtape drop in December.
2515000	2520000	What is your. What's your. What's your. What's your mixtape name.
2521000	2524000	It's called Straight Fire. It's straight fire.
2527000	2530000	And there's no way to know when you're making fun of me or not.
2533000	2542000	You get to control. You get to control everything. He gets to make you feel uneasy. You get. You could easily like if you. Is there anything that you could link to or anything.
2544000	2545000	No I was lying.
2547000	2549000	What. Who is the real you. What are you doing.
2551000	2555000	I'm not sure exactly what you mean. Well what are you. Are you a student. Do you have a job.
2556000	2568000	I'm a student. I own you. L.M.U. L.M.U. What's L.A. What is that. Loyola Mary. It's a college. Where. Tell me what the L.M.U. stands for Loyola Marymount University.
2569000	2571000	It's like near USC.
2572000	2576000	You seem like you want to go to this. It's like south towards the airport sort of.
2577000	2581000	Towards the airport. You got you got KXLU record radio station there right.
2582000	2591000	Don't you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's it's pretty white. Would you tell some other other other black kids to come to the show.
2593000	2594000	I don't know many other.
2595000	2614000	We got to take baby steps so you need to be satisfied having any black people here. Like he's a piece of black guy listens to podcasts you know like he's he may or may not have only black friends.
2615000	2621000	Well I want to get. Well no I didn't I didn't make that mistake. But like the the white guy that brought you here.
2622000	2628000	What about him. Your your your friend your white your white friend.
2630000	2632000	Does he does he have any black friends.
2636000	2638000	I am the black friend.
2644000	2650000	And you don't really make mixtapes. No no I don't. He said he has a mixtape dropping sometimes.
2652000	2656000	You dropped that off to your girlfriend. That's in 1987.
2657000	2661000	What do you what are you studying. I'm undeclared right now.
2662000	2667000	What would be your dream gig if you could like have your pie in the sky. Like do you do anything you wanted for a living.
2668000	2670000	I'd probably be on community.
2670000	2671000	Oh.
2679000	2682000	Fairy tales can come true.
2683000	2688000	It can happen to you. Well there's a yeah there's a table in the back that's where they.
2689000	2690000	There's a.
2691000	2693000	You put your head. Yeah.
2694000	2696000	You put your headshot in a basket back there.
2696000	2697000	Everybody knows that.
2698000	2702000	Is this your first time at the show. Yes. Yeah. So you don't know about the.
2703000	2710000	I mean I mean I know you're joking but is there a part in your back of your head because you knew that Spencer was just a fan came one time and he got on the show.
2711000	2715000	Do any people here harbor a little tiny feeling that maybe they can get Adam. I know you think that.
2717000	2719000	I've been on twice.
2720000	2722000	Oh really. I don't watch the show.
2722000	2723000	I don't watch the show.
2725000	2733000	Yeah I think Adam started coming to the Harman down shows because he was on community. So he got wind of like. Yeah. Oh is that right. Yeah. I didn't know that.
2735000	2736000	Jamal so.
2738000	2743000	Other than wanting to be on television like what what what what is your dream.
2746000	2750000	I have no idea. How old are you. I'm 18. Oh yeah you don't have to know yet.
2752000	2754000	Do whatever you want. Be nice if you knew.
2757000	2762000	His parents aren't paying for him to have a lifetime vacation.
2763000	2767000	Did you know you wanted to be 18. Yeah. I was going to be a sportscaster.
2773000	2779000	And I refused their money and I worked hard at Marquette University to become a sports journalist.
2782000	2789000	For real. Yeah.
2797000	2799000	Or maybe I can lie too.
2799000	2811000	All right. Cute. Cute the. Let me let me do some rapping.
2813000	2826000	Jamal you're going to want to say for this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. From the streets. Yeah. From the streets. Yeah. From the streets to the streets streets from the alley to the streets from the streets to the roads.
2827000	2834000	Fucked your mama like a frog or a toad. Put my dick in her mouth dissection. Fucked your mama's infection.
2837000	2838000	Gross.
2840000	2844000	Fucked your mama from the ceiling to the floor. Fucked your mama so hard she wanted some more.
2846000	2850000	Fucked your mama down the hall. Fucked your mama in the summer and fall.
2851000	2871000	Fucked your mama in the new way. Fucked your mama until she was gay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. New area. Okay. Whoa. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Left to the right. Fucked your mama until she lost her sight.
2872000	2882000	Needed a stick to walk around. Fucked your mama until she didn't know what town. Hold on. Hold on.
2885000	2890000	Jamal. What city are you from? Claremont? Where's that?
2894000	2898000	Is this in California? Oh God. All right.
2898000	2911000	All right. Yo. Yo. J to the A to the M-A-L. Fucked your mama so hard but she'll never tell. That doesn't mean it was rape.
2916000	2920000	Okay. Jamal everybody. Thank you.
2920000	2931000	Thank you Jamal. Now Dan, while the beat is still rolling, I want you to sing the melody hook like you were going to die tomorrow.
2932000	2946000	Yo. Yo. Hello. Rain. Rain comes down on your umbrella. Every drop makes you me. I'm your guy.
2947000	2950000	Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo.
2960000	2965000	It's very unsettling to me that an 18 year old kid can come up and just go, I wish I was white.
2966000	2974000	And then have me go like, yeah. Yeah. And then kind of like try to meet him halfway and then he's like, I'm just fucking with you, bro.
2975000	2987000	Like I don't know if you noticed, but it kind of threw me because I'm like, I'm like, well, if we're really living in a post-racial America, then then we have a huge problem because we're then that means that we're.
2991000	2998000	We have, there's a huge, there's a, there's a, we're not paying attention to certain things that.
2999000	3002000	Is the problem that when he said he wishes you were white, he wasn't lying?
3003000	3014000	No, no, God, no. I don't want him to be telling the truth when he says that. I'm saying like the idea that it's become a joke, that race can become a joke before we address the issues that are tagged race.
3015000	3023000	That's the troubling thing to me as a Gen Xer. That's the troubling thing. I think that behind, I'm getting a little tipsy, so I should not be talking in this area.
3024000	3036000	But I, so let me, let me put a pin in it. The, I, I, I, I think that race is tied to wealth distribution in an unfortunate way that needs to be paid attention to.
3037000	3044000	And I think that the race as artificial construct egalitarian, let's all, let's all ignore everything that separates us.
3045000	3062000	Is 50% the solution and 50% part of a shell game as part of a larger system that says, you know, you're racist if you pay attention to anything that separates anybody because it keeps your eyes off of like the Walnut that has the pee under it.
3063000	3067000	And I'm too drunk to go further with that. Also too uneducated.
3068000	3075000	I dropped out of my first semester at college, so I don't have anything to back that up, but I always get suspicious of that. And that's the same thing with religion.
3076000	3087000	When you hear me piping up about religion, it's like, I had like a big Twitter exchange following the David Cross episode, or I thought David Cross is, as Aaron says, David Cross's atheism is truly empowering.
3088000	3114000	Like he's the kind of guy that's like, he goes, Hey, I'm an atheist. Nobody else should be. I, I, and the, the thing that makes me argue with people who are evangelical about their atheism is this suspicion I have that, that the things that we're tending to blame just religion on, which is basically like kind of all bad stuff.
3114000	3127000	Like it makes, it freaks me out that we can just jump on that because I get worried about the real criminals who are inherently not religious people or atheists.
3128000	3143000	They're just capitalists and they get away with actual crimes that there's a class system that is, that is tied to this stuff. And that when you say in this country that there's a culture war and you point at all the dummies that have, you know, they believe so much in God that they think the world was created.
3144000	3160000	In six days, you're also talking about people who play scratch offs and believe in the horoscopes. You're talking about people who are kind of exploited. You're talking about people who have been convinced by people who are kind of bullying them that their faith should be put in like military and fear of strangers and all this stuff.
3160000	3173000	And it's like, I just worry a little bit about the intelligentsia, just like dog piling on all religion because I don't think the corner pastor in your neighborhood is like at the top of the conspiracy.
3174000	3188000	So too drunk. My obsession with race and religion and all that stuff is like, I'm always suspicious of like the actual thing in the room, which is like, you know, rich people have more than poor people and they kind of, we kind of never talk about that.
3189000	3199000	And I don't know if that's because it's boring or if it's because it's like if they're actually successfully distracting us from talking about it. So how'd your vasectomy go?
3200000	3201000	Aces.
3206000	3209000	I hope I didn't. I hope I didn't get too drunk to play Shadow.
3210000	3211000	Don't get too drunk to play Shadow.
3211000	3213000	No, I don't. Don't tell me not to.
3214000	3219000	Your character, because I've read, Spencer sent me your character sheet. Did you see one of your negative qualities on there?
3220000	3221000	Alcoholism.
3222000	3223000	Severe alcoholism.
3224000	3227000	All right. So it's a big night. We're going to start playing Shadow tonight.
3231000	3235000	What's what's what is that video? What's that? What is the what's the plan for the video?
3236000	3237000	What is it?
3239000	3240000	What is the what are you doing?
3242000	3243000	The experience.
3244000	3246000	The that's the most ironic statement in the world.
3247000	3249000	You're sitting in the room.
3250000	3251000	You paid ten dollars.
3252000	3254000	The there's cameras everywhere.
3255000	3256000	The entire thing is being live stream.
3257000	3258000	How long has that camera been up?
3259000	3262000	Like since I started talking about anything that might get me in trouble. Is that.
3265000	3269000	What but what is it like are you from out of town and you're like they won't believe this.
3270000	3272000	First time I've been able to get to our town.
3273000	3274000	Not all the way to that.
3274000	3275000	All right. Okay. Okay.
3276000	3278000	I lashed out at my best friend. I'm sorry.
3280000	3281000	Where are you from?
3282000	3283000	L.A.
3285000	3286000	What part of L.A.
3287000	3288000	I grew up in Venice.
3288000	3290000	Venice. Nice. Do you go to Venice High?
3291000	3294000	No, because my parents thought I would get shot. So they sent me to Santa Monica.
3295000	3296000	Did you get shot?
3297000	3298000	Didn't get shot.
3299000	3300000	Didn't get shot. Your parents were right again.
3307000	3312000	Now speaking of like the kind of anti-capitalist distribution of wealth thing.
3313000	3315000	I think it's kind of built into this whole Shadowrun universe.
3316000	3317000	It's a very kind of for sure. Yeah.
3318000	3323000	Yeah. It's the corporations have taken over and there's a group of mercenaries who either exploit it or are exploited by it or.
3323000	3329000	I believe we are a dragon awakening away from living in the world that that Shadowrun exists in. Yeah. Yeah.
3330000	3331000	All right. Well let's bring out.
3333000	3336000	Should we bring him out in one at a time or just bring him out.
3337000	3339000	Let's bring out my wife Erin McGathey.
3346000	3347000	Hello.
3354000	3355000	Whoa.
3356000	3357000	Thank you. Hello.

3364000	3365000	I'm the baby.
3366000	3368000	Female lead. I would. Yeah.
3369000	3370000	Oh that's nice. Yeah. Thanks.
3371000	3372000	Unless the baby's a girl.
3378000	3379000	I think the baby's a boy.
3380000	3381000	Baby's a boy.
3383000	3384000	Thanks for having me.
3386000	3387000	But you're the baby. I haven't seen it. I'm sorry.
3388000	3395000	I'm not the baby. This is a this is a channel one on one show from Alex and Ariel that that one first this last week.
3396000	3399000	And I play. I play the wife to a man who wants to kill our baby.
3401000	3403000	OK. Yeah. Check it out.
3404000	3408000	All right. Was this all part of that nationwide insurance campaign that was in the server bowl today.
3410000	3411000	Explain the nation wide thing.
3411000	3417000	I think like I was I was watching at the drawing room and the sound was kind of like like at half. Pardon me. 50 percent. So I couldn't quite hear it.
3418000	3424000	And there was a kid like and he's in a bathtub but he's sailing the seven seas with this dog and he's in the treehouse and he's got the dog up there.
3425000	3429000	And then then like he's like a kid like being like an imagineer of his own fun.
3430000	3439000	And then all of a sudden there's just a picture of a bathtub that's overflowed and then a TV that's fallen like clearly would have crushed anybody beneath it.
3440000	3446000	And it said you know most childhood deaths are preventable. And everyone in the bar was like wow.
3448000	3450000	Dead baby commercial.
3452000	3455000	Does the company tell you what's appropriate to put in different rooms in your house.
3456000	3464000	It says like go to don't kill your baby dot com and we'll fucking we'll help you safe up your house from from certain disaster or give us five hundred dollars a month.
3465000	3467000	And we'll make sure it's fucking horrible.
3468000	3469000	And be ashamed of anything bad you have on your baby.
3471000	3472000	You got a good baby.
3474000	3476000	Your son seems like a nice kid.
3477000	3482000	Be ashamed of some I don't know maybe maybe a flat flat screen television lands on his head.
3483000	3490000	I don't know. It happens. It happens all the time. Go to go to don't kill your baby dot com. You see terrible statistics about such things.
3491000	3493000	That I would hate to see happen to your only son.
3496000	3498000	With the high heels and the trash cans.
3501000	3514000	He wears the high heels and the rag on his head. Yeah. When the when the gay son comes out he clearly the young actor was confused and they just threw a scarf on him and the things and they're like come out like you're doing the wrong thing.
3515000	3517000	So it's a six year old actor doing this like it's a little boy doing this.
3517000	3524000	Yeah. It's a flashback really offensive because because it means that gay means that you wear high heels and scarves on your head.
3525000	3533000	I dressed up as a kid a lot and some of that included dressing up in women's clothing because I had two I had two options dad's clothes or mom's clothes and I wore them all.
3536000	3538000	Sounds like a poll quote from your autobiography.
3540000	3541000	I wore them all.
3542000	3553000	I do recall coming up because my parents would have these swanky like late 70s dinner parties and there was like fondue and all the dudes had suits and great mustaches and looked like the Marlboro man and the women all had great dresses on and were named Lorraine and shit and they all smoked.
3554000	3555000	Do you think there was some key business happening?
3556000	3556000	
3557000	3559000	The key party business? Do you think your parents were part of?
3560000	3566000	You know I've actually considered that retrospectively but I don't think so. I don't think it was really that kind of vibe.
3567000	3571000	It was a pretty permissive environment in terms of but like it was not like like yeah it was 70s.
3572000	3587000	People were groovy and the guys like did their thing and the women like with kibbits and talk and smoke and drink and then I do remember coming out of my mom's bathroom and like took one of her products like I like eyeliner or lipstick and like I think I put it on and I did a big like Revlon commercial for everybody.
3588000	3589000	That's so cute.
3590000	3602000	Like you watch TV and they do commercials so they would be having this dinner party that my brother and I were not supposed to come out and interrupt because they were being adults and probably swinging, probably fucking.
3603000	3609000	And I would just come out and interrupt it for a little 30 second spot where I would come out and sell you some lipstick that I found.
3610000	3612000	So you would come out and go like Revlon?
3613000	3617000	Yeah, the new Revlon Ultra color. The new thing with the lips.
3620000	3622000	Was your mom putting the makeup on you or you?
3623000	3626000	No, I was just raiding her bathroom and finding things to sell like to do commercials for.
3627000	3628000	Got it.
3629000	3632000	Also I was auditioning for commercials around that time too so maybe that was in my head as well.
3633000	3637000	Did I ever tell you the one about me running into a party with some information that I discovered?
3638000	3639000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've heard that.
3640000	3641000	That was a good question.
3642000	3643000	Alright.
3644000	3646000	Let's bring out Game Master Spencer Crichton.
3647000	3648000	Game Master.
3649000	3651000	He is the Gay Master.
3652000	3653000	Game Master.
3654000	3655000	Put him in a trash can. He hiles off.
3656000	3658000	Game Master all day long.
3661000	3662000	Hey guys.
3663000	3664000	Hey Spencer, what's cooking man?
3665000	3666000	Oh, you know, just throwing away children.
3669000	3674000	I don't know. I don't know you guys. I'm kind of, I'm kind of all run out, run out of juice.
3675000	3675000	
3676000	3677000	Yeah.
3680000	3681000	It's 9-11.
3682000	3683000	Oh, I didn't even...
3685000	3688000	It's not, it's January 1st. The clock says 9-11.
3689000	3695000	I wasn't even thinking it was 9-11 when I said that but like, yeah, this getting close to my bedtime, it's just, you know, it's no good.
3696000	3697000	We do this every week.
3698000	3701000	And I usually go to bed at like 10 or 9-30 if I can.
3702000	3704000	Yeah, sleep's the best part of the day.
3705000	3709000	Also, you've been, as far as I know, you've been spending a good part of your waking hours working on Shadow Run for us.
3710000	3712000	Yeah, I mean, it is, yeah.
3713000	3718000	I've read the book about four times now and I still barely understand it.
3719000	3723000	I reread some of that stuff multiple times and I still have only a passing knowledge of it.
3724000	3725000	I haven't read it and I get it.
3725000	3726000	Yep.
3727000	3728000	Are our friends...
3728000	3729000	I'll teach you.
3729000	3730000	Is Demarge Brown here?
3730000	3731000	Yeah, he's here.
3731000	3732000	Oh, okay. Demarge, are you here?
3732000	3733000	Demarge Brown.
3734000	3737000	Demarge Brown!
3737000	3740000	Downtown! Demarge Brown.
3744000	3746000	Demarge, do you know Jamal?
3748000	3749000	I don't...
3750000	3752000	I don't know Jamal but I will meet him.
3752000	3755000	He lives a very sequestered life.
3757000	3759000	I can reach him through the network.
3762000	3763000	Black people!
3764000	3767000	There's a special slash, yeah, special...
3768000	3772000	Jamal's an extra special name because it's a math book name.
3774000	3775000	You know what I mean?
3775000	3776000	Well, everyone's saying what?
3776000	3785000	But when I was in school in math books where it has pictures of different people, a lot of the African-American kids were named Jamal.
3786000	3787000	Math book name.
3790000	3800000	Which is why, as a white writer, if you say that if you know a character is African-American, you cannot name them Jamal.
3800000	3807000	There's a list, there's a short list of names that the other white writers will go, no, send it back.
3807000	3810000	You can't do that, which is funny.
3810000	3816000	You should tell them that in the world of commercials because when you audition for commercials, pretty much every script that has a black character in it, it's named Jamal.
3816000	3818000	Why is that?
3818000	3819000	I think that's part of the reason.
3820000	3821000	I think it's just Eben Flo.
3821000	3824000	It's a beautiful name and you're a beautiful person.
3824000	3827000	That's why I think it ebbs and flows.
3827000	3829000	I think culture gets a hold of it.
3829000	3850000	I think white writers, they're all white, they get confident and the bubble inflates and then it bursts because the ninth all-state commercial to have a kid named Jamal in it, then somebody starts going like, this is the new Leroy, we can't do this anymore.
3850000	3854000	Dan, when you're creating a black character for a community or another show.
3854000	3855000	I would never do such a thing.
3856000	3860000	You know Dan's the first person Hollywood goes to when they're creating a new black character.
3860000	3861000	He's a consultant.
3862000	3866000	Have you ever gone and tried to say, I want to make this a black sounding name.
3866000	3869000	Like, for instance, I'm unlikely to meet a white demorge.
3869000	3871000	Demorge sounds like an African man.
3871000	3874000	Well, we in the United States, you're not, but in Switzerland, you are.
3874000	3875000	Is that right?
3875000	3876000	And in Europe, you're not.
3876000	3877000	Oh, I didn't know that.
3877000	3878000	There's a whole village full of family.
3878000	3879000	No shit?
3879000	3881000	There's a village of demorges?
3882000	3883000	It's a last name.
3883000	3886000	It's a last name, but there's also, I mean, there's a horse, the racing horse right now
3886000	3887000	named Demorge.
3887000	3889000	Demorge, stepping so racist.
3889000	3890000	I love it.
3890000	3893000	No, no, like in this country now, but outside of that spirit.
3893000	3895000	But it's a unique first name, right?
3895000	3896000	Yeah.
3896000	3897000	Yeah.
3897000	3900000	We cast Keith David in this season of Community.
3900000	3904000	So the character, the actor is cast before the character is named.
3904000	3909000	So here's a room full of white writers, like have to come up with a name for a black man.
3909000	3912000	So that is a factor for us.
3912000	3913000	I would like to hear all the pitches.
3913000	3916000	I bet you would.
3916000	3919000	And also like, you know, it's like the conversations that we have about it.
3919000	3926000	This is the real world, the ugly, strange, twisted balloon animal world of racial consciousness.
3926000	3929000	You know, like white writers going like, well, I don't know.
3929000	3931000	Well, not that for sure.
3931000	3934000	And one of the things is he's not named Jamal.
3934000	3935000	That's for sure.
3935000	3938000	I just went with like, I just went all the way.
3938000	3941000	His name is Elroy Patashnik.
3941000	3943000	I was like, I can't.
3943000	3945000	I'm running from this.
3945000	3948000	I'm not doing it.
3948000	3951000	Geordello, Yaphet Kodo's character in The Homicide,
3951000	3953000	it was based on a real story.
3953000	3956000	And the real head of the Homicide Department was a Sicilian.
3956000	3960000	But when they cast the actors, the actor they liked the most was Yaphet Kodo.
3960000	3962000	So they didn't change the script at all.
3962000	3964000	He was just named Al Geordello.
3964000	3967000	And for the whole series, he walks around when the officers are confused.
3967000	3969000	The Sicilians have a saying, and he speaks in Sicilian.
3969000	3971000	And then he says, get out of my office.
3971000	3975000	And he pulls a red table wine out and starts eating Italian food.
3975000	3977000	They just didn't bother to change anything.
3977000	3978000	No, no, no, they didn't change at all.
3978000	3979000	They just made him a black Sicilian.
3979000	3982000	And then later on, they wanted to bring him a son,
3982000	3984000	bring his personal life into it.
3984000	3985000	And they brought a real black Sicilian.
3985000	3988000	They brought Giancarlo Esposito into play, his son.
3988000	3992000	It just sort of had this crashing of details.
3992000	3993000	That's great.
3993000	4001000	Do you guys remember when Dan said, I'll fuck your mama in her infection?
4001000	4003000	It rhymed with some.
4003000	4006000	No, I know.
4006000	4011000	I find these days that when I rap, one of two things happens.
4011000	4015000	Something comes out that's so gross that I stop and go, that's gross.
4015000	4018000	Or it's just stuff that I've already said.
4018000	4021000	It's like mentally exploring the idea that there is a man somewhere
4021000	4026000	that refers to his wife's vaginas, her infection.
4026000	4030000	See, where that conjured in my mind, it wasn't her vagina.
4030000	4034000	She had some other infection that he was fucking.
4034000	4038000	It might have been on her thigh or her calf or something.
4038000	4040000	Or maybe Adam and Eve.
4040000	4042000	Adam was like, oh, you're so great.
4042000	4043000	I don't know why I'm attracted to you.
4043000	4044000	I am.
4044000	4045000	What is that?
4045000	4046000	Are you sick?
4046000	4049000	It looks like it could look like a...
4050000	4055000	It does seem like you're not well, like in a vacuum.
4055000	4059000	If all you knew was men and then a woman pulled her pants down,
4059000	4062000	you'd be like, are you all right?
4062000	4064000	And vice versa.
4064000	4069000	If all you saw were women and then a man, you'd be like, whoa.
4069000	4070000	The first time I saw her.
4070000	4073000	This is not a controversial statement.
4073000	4078000	I think what you're saying, Dan, is boys have wee-wees and girls have crackwees.
4079000	4082000	It's similar to ax wound, which is such a gross...
4084000	4086000	Which is a terrible thing to say.
4086000	4087000	I'm really laughing.
4087000	4091000	There are 900 words for a vagina, and none of them are pleasant, really.
4091000	4094000	There's a couple that are passable, but mostly just no.
4094000	4096000	Paloma.
4096000	4098000	No, you just ruined that name.
4098000	4100000	You call her Pussy Paloma?
4100000	4106000	No, that's our name for our unborn daughter that is not...
4107000	4109000	He just called your Pussy your Paloma.
4109000	4110000	I believe...
4110000	4111000	I mean, we'll just change it.
4111000	4112000	Her name just won't be Paloma.
4112000	4117000	Dan and I have talks about naming a daughter Paloma.
4117000	4119000	Paloma!
4119000	4120000	That was a ghost.
4120000	4122000	Pull it together.
4122000	4123000	All right, sorry, Spencer.
4123000	4124000	Hey, guys.
4124000	4126000	When you say you're an unborn daughter, have you conceived?
4126000	4128000	Are you trying to actively right now?
4128000	4129000	What's going on?
4132000	4133000	No.
4134000	4136000	I'm giggling because you're the first person who's asked.
4136000	4140000	No, we are not actively trying to...
4140000	4141000	What a weird question.
4141000	4142000	I don't know.
4143000	4144000	Are you trying to make a baby?
4144000	4145000	You said that, is it?
4146000	4147000	No, no.
4148000	4149000	I'm sorry for being too personal.
4149000	4150000	That's way too personal.
4150000	4151000	I'm sorry.
4151000	4152000	I don't need to press you that much.
4152000	4153000	No, let us...
4153000	4155000	I'm coming in our pits a lot.
4155000	4156000	Is that...
4158000	4160000	Which brings us back to cocking story.
4160000	4162000	But I'm stopping it up with a paper towel
4162000	4165000	and doing what I call stuffing the tunnel.
4165000	4166000	Isn't that...
4166000	4168000	We read somewhere...
4168000	4170000	It's a great way to get an infection, I know that.
4170000	4171000	We call it to merging.
4173000	4174000	You call what?
4178000	4179000	That wasn't fair.
4181000	4182000	I'm just here, man.
4182000	4183000	I'm just here.
4185000	4189000	Well, we're waiting until June 1st.
4189000	4191000	We're going to start conceiving.
4195000	4198000	We've decided we want our child's birthday
4198000	4202000	to be a very specific date.
4202000	4203000	And then...
4203000	4204000	So we're just going to cast a wide net
4204000	4207000	and take advantage of our God-given right to abortion.
4213000	4214000	Is that...
4215000	4216000	Yeah.
4217000	4219000	We're not Republicans, for God's sake.
4220000	4221000	Was there a misunderstanding?
4221000	4223000	I want my kid to be born on April 15th.
4224000	4228000	Because I want to remember my taxes are due and also...
4236000	4240000	It'll be our first child, but our fifth pregnancy.
4241000	4243000	I mean, you guys...
4243000	4245000	Those of you who have come to the show live,
4245000	4248000	this glow is not un-pregnant.
4250000	4251000	Look at me.
4251000	4252000	I'm beaming.
4254000	4256000	What if we can't have kids?
4256000	4259000	I mean, if anybody can't, it's got to be me, right?
4261000	4263000	Don't I just seem sterile?
4265000	4267000	I feel sterile.
4267000	4268000	I feel sterile.
4273000	4274000	I just feel like...
4274000	4275000	I feel so sterile.
4279000	4281000	Is that your way of just talking yourself
4281000	4283000	out of ever having to wear a condom?
4284000	4286000	Oh, baby, I'd never get you pregnant.
4287000	4288000	I'm so sterile as shit.
4288000	4291000	No, I've never used that as an excuse in the past.
4291000	4292000	I'm married now.
4292000	4293000	I'm just saying, like...
4294000	4295000	Yeah, no.
4296000	4297000	It just doesn't seem like...
4298000	4299000	When I look at myself in the mirror,
4299000	4300000	I don't go,
4300000	4301000	Ah, potency.
4305000	4306000	I go like,
4307000	4308000	Paul Giamatti.
4310000	4313000	You don't picture him firing off
4314000	4316000	like a million Giamatti's.
4317000	4319000	You think in order to make a new Paul Giamatti,
4319000	4322000	you'd have to catch one and distill it
4322000	4324000	and, like, help it,
4324000	4327000	put wheels on its tail,
4329000	4331000	put it on a sperm track to an egg
4331000	4334000	that's, like, in braces.
4337000	4338000	We made a new Giamatti.
4340000	4341000	It wasn't easy.
4342000	4343000	The park is open.
4344000	4347000	I don't know what kind of new Giamatti you're making in there.
4348000	4350000	It doesn't sound like a good idea.
4352000	4354000	Don't you see what you're doing, Giamatti?
4355000	4357000	You're tampering with nature.
4359000	4362000	Spent so much time thinking whether you could make another Paul Giamatti.
4363000	4364000	Sure, it didn't stop.
4365000	4367000	That is one big pile of money.
4368000	4369000	I don't know.
4369000	4370000	It didn't stop.
4371000	4373000	That is one big pile of Giamatti shit.
4374000	4377000	I think it's time to start getting into our shadow run for this evening.
4378000	4379000	Fuckin' hey, man.
4379000	4380000	Yeah.
4380000	4381000	That's why I brought him out early.
4381000	4382000	See?
4382000	4384000	You brought me on at the normal time.
4385000	4386000	Well, I brought you out earlier,
4386000	4387000	but then we talked,
4387000	4388000	and you know how we usually bring you out?
4388000	4390000	It's normal time.
4391000	4392000	Normal time you bring me out.
4392000	4393000	It's my fault.
4393000	4394000	There's nothing wrong with it.
4394000	4396000	Just call them like I see it.
4396000	4398000	Well, I listened to the show last week,
4398000	4399000	and I heard all of your awesome characters,
4399000	4400000	and I'm very excited about it,
4400000	4403000	and so I should probably start off by revealing my character, correct?
4403000	4404000	Yeah.
4404000	4405000	Correct.
4405000	4406000	Is that good?
4406000	4407000	Is that right, Spencer?
4407000	4408000	Yeah, that's fine,
4408000	4409000	because our characters all know each other,
4409000	4412000	so we're not going to be meeting each other.
4412000	4413000	No.
4413000	4415000	We're going to be beginning on,
4415000	4416000	as I understand it,
4416000	4418000	we're going to be beginning already having known each other.
4418000	4420000	Yeah, you're like a team of shadow runners.
4420000	4421000	I love it.
4422000	4423000	There you go.
4423000	4424000	I'm so excited.
4424000	4425000	We're going to really try to do it right.
4425000	4430000	And I'm sorry, I got, but not too drunk.
4430000	4431000	Thank you.
4431000	4433000	I just got a little too drunk.
4435000	4437000	But, I mean, not too drunk.
4437000	4438000	All right.
4438000	4440000	Well, my character's name is Eve.
4440000	4441000	Yes.
4441000	4443000	Eve was born, but you know what?
4443000	4445000	Do you play a little Vangelis?
4445000	4446000	Funny you should say that.
4446000	4448000	I think I have a song for my thing.
4448000	4449000	If I were here last week,
4449000	4450000	I would have done music for all of you.
4450000	4451000	Oh, by the way, last week,
4451000	4454000	I never said Yacht was the name of the band, right, Dustin?
4454000	4458000	Like Yacht, who's like, actually, I mean,
4458000	4460000	they don't need to give their music away.
4460000	4461000	Oh, it's a great, great band.
4461000	4462000	Yeah.
4462000	4463000	Who did I play tonight, Dustin?
4463000	4465000	The song called My Kind of Devil.
4465000	4466000	Do we know?
4466000	4467000	You should be in that pile.
4467000	4469000	It's not on here, but we'll find it out.
4469000	4470000	We'll put it on the thing.
4470000	4471000	But thank you, who forever wrote that?
4471000	4472000	I like that song.
4472000	4473000	Okay, so here we go with Eve.
4473000	4475000	Let's see what we got here.
4476000	4478000	If you like any music you hear in the show,
4478000	4481000	go find out who made it.
4484000	4491000	Jamal has a mix of all of the music tonight at Blackfire.org.
4501000	4502000	Pardon me.
4502000	4505000	Eve was born the daughter of two loving middle-class
4505000	4506000	elf shamans.
4506000	4508000	Before her birth,
4508000	4511000	her parents ran a successful chain of alchemy stores in Seattle,
4511000	4513000	but they were squeezed out of business
4513000	4517000	by big alchemy.
4517000	4518000	And with a baby on the way,
4518000	4523000	they chose very reluctantly to work for the mega-corporation Neonet.
4523000	4524000	In exchange for big pay,
4524000	4527000	they became nothing more than corporate mage slaves,
4527000	4530000	selling their magic that's in the book,
4530000	4534000	selling their magic and prostituting their sacred shamanic tradition,
4534000	4538000	helping Neonet enhance their security and exploit the world.
4538000	4541000	When their daughter, Ev Duryel, was born,
4542000	4545000	they were determined to protect her from their own sad fate.
4545000	4547000	Before she could be given a system ID number
4547000	4549000	and be absorbed by the state,
4549000	4551000	they took their newborn daughter and left her to be raised
4551000	4554000	by sinless elf magicians who lived in the woods around Seattle
4554000	4558000	in mystic harmony with the Native American shamans of the Salish tribe.
4558000	4561000	There, between her new elven and Native American family,
4561000	4564000	she grew to learn and control her own powerful magic
4564000	4567000	and to connect with the great spirits of Mother Earth.
4567000	4570000	At 13 years old, however,
4570000	4574000	her peaceful life was shattered when her community was raided by awakened cops
4574000	4577000	on astral patrol for illegal gatherings of magicians.
4577000	4580000	Many of her people were slaughtered or arrested.
4580000	4584000	Some, like Ev Duryel, managed to escape, alone and terrified,
4584000	4587000	and burning with hatred for the violent power of the mega-corp
4587000	4591000	that destroyed her life and the lives of parents she'd never known.
4591000	4595000	Ev Duryel vowed to use her magic however she could to undermine the powerful
4595000	4598000	and return this world to its natural state of harmony
4598000	4602000	with Earth's great spirit, and maybe see her family again.
4602000	4604000	Not done.
4604000	4609000	Before fleeing the woods to hide in the bustling anonymity of the city sprawl,
4609000	4612000	she called upon the spirit world for guidance.
4612000	4616000	Her buried anger and stormy personality led her to take on the powerful mentor spirit
4616000	4619000	of the Thunderbird, whose beacon claws are lightning,
4619000	4622000	and her cry is the clap of thunder!
4624000	4627000	The Thunderbird spirit now guides her to use her power for good
4627000	4631000	and to destroy those who would oppose the spirits of the natural world.
4631000	4636000	Armed with her magic, a cat-like agility, and an old Comanche war club,
4636000	4639000	she learned to survive on the streets as a shadow runner.
4639000	4644000	She is now 20 years old, and she runs by the name of Eve Libertine.
4649000	4651000	It is such a shame.
4652000	4657000	There should have been someone doing an interpretive dance during that.
4662000	4667000	I want you guys to do that over again, but remember when your mother got shot.
4672000	4678000	Alright, so everyone knows everyone, right? You're all ready.
4678000	4682000	I know Mercy, I know Eve, and I want to recount.
4682000	4684000	What's your character's name, Demord?
4684000	4686000	Hordegard.
4686000	4688000	Hordegard.
4688000	4690000	Okay, the most amazing character ever.
4694000	4696000	Yeah, I snorted.
4696000	4698000	Deal with it.
4698000	4701000	Hashtag, yes, all snorters.
4703000	4705000	Timely.
4709000	4711000	Yes, all snorted.
4711000	4713000	Alright, okay.
4713000	4718000	I have new theme music for Spencer's new intro to Shadowrun.
4718000	4722000	The thing is, I'm not sure if there's a proper intro to this,
4722000	4726000	because those were all kind of like recaps, but there's nothing to recap.
4726000	4728000	Okay, then we'll save that for next time.
4728000	4731000	Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't know you guys.
4731000	4736000	Okay, so you're all shadow runners, you're on a shadowrunning team, we all know this.
4737000	4739000	That's background.
4739000	4740000	What?
4740000	4742000	Alright, alright, alright.
4742000	4743000	Maybe just an intro.
4743000	4746000	Why do you guys care? What is your investment in this music?
4746000	4748000	Because it makes it special.
4748000	4749000	Does it?
4749000	4750000	We like it.
4750000	4753000	It would be special if I got to say the things that I wrote.
4753000	4756000	I mean, that's special to me.
4756000	4760000	All this hubbub isn't doing it. I don't know.
4762000	4765000	When did you stop believing in magic?
4766000	4767000	I don't get it.
4767000	4769000	We'll save the music for you next time.
4769000	4772000	That'll be extra special for our recap, kind of a la the old days.
4772000	4773000	Right now, we'll just go in dry.
4773000	4774000	Makes sense to me, Jeff.
4774000	4776000	Alright, alright.
4776000	4777000	Alright.
4777000	4780000	Shadowrunners, shadowrunning team, gotcha.
4780000	4781000	Alright.
4781000	4785000	You all pile out of your Uber before the car scoots away,
4785000	4790000	leaving you standing in the shade of the rotting wooden facade of a dive bar,
4790000	4792000	Hank's last stand.
4792000	4796000	You've all received the same message from your fixer, Cool Dennis.
4802000	4804000	The message is as false.
4804000	4806000	Listen, guys, I done something bad.
4806000	4808000	I got to lay low for a while.
4808000	4811000	But look, I know you need to pay rent, same as always,
4811000	4813000	so I'm putting you in touch with Teddy.
4813000	4816000	He was my fixer before I got my start fixing.
4816000	4817000	He's your man.
4817000	4820000	He'll be picking up all of my slack while I'm gone,
4820000	4824000	and I'll be making a nice little kickback for myself for every job you guys complete.
4824000	4827000	So don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.
4827000	4830000	Anyway, trust me, I'll be back on my feet in a few months.
4830000	4831000	Don't you fret.
4831000	4833000	Head to Hank's last stand, got me?
4833000	4835000	Teddy's the new Cool Dennis.
4839000	4840000	Stand up.
4840000	4842000	So there you are, in front of the dive bar,
4842000	4846000	and out through the double doors bursts a squatting strange figure.
4846000	4847000	It's Teddy.
4847000	4852000	He's wearing an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt, white shorts, and flip-flops.
4852000	4854000	A stun baton hangs from his belt.
4854000	4856000	Oh, yeah, and he's a dwarf.
4858000	4859000	Howdy, I'm Teddy.
4859000	4861000	It's great to finally meet you a lot.
4861000	4864000	You see, Cool Dennis told me all about you.
4864000	4867000	Now, I'm sure you have a lot of questions, and I respect that,
4867000	4870000	but right now I've actually got a Johnson on the Rhine who needs a run soon,
4870000	4872000	as in, like, right now.
4872000	4874000	So why don't we go inside and see what he needs?
4874000	4875000	Sound good?
4876000	4877000	Sounds great.
4877000	4878000	All right.
4878000	4881000	A Johnson is street talk for a corporate client.
4882000	4883000	Yes, yes.
4886000	4890000	All right, Jim, stop wasting our fragging time.
4890000	4891000	Let's go inside.
4895000	4899000	Inside the moldy bar is empty, but for a tired old cowboy of a bartender,
4899000	4903000	sat in a corner idly watching sports on a big screen TV,
4903000	4906000	then Teddy calls out, Hank, if you wouldn't mind.
4906000	4909000	The old man nods and flips the game over to AR speak,
4909000	4912000	and he shuffles out of the back room.
4912000	4914000	Teddy touches a button on his comm link.
4914000	4915000	That's a cell phone.
4915000	4920000	And the big screen TV flashes as a shadowy businessman persona appears on screen.
4920000	4922000	Teddy's all like,
4922000	4926000	Now, if you'll forgive me, Mr. Johnson, me and the crew were just catching up on old times.
4926000	4928000	They're old standbys.
4928000	4930000	The best new upstarts in the shadows.
4930000	4932000	Isn't that right?
4932000	4934000	He points to mercy.
4934000	4935000	Isn't that right?
4935000	4938000	Gestures you to mercy.
4938000	4940000	That's right. Yeah.
4940000	4941000	Yeah, that's good.
4941000	4946000	You're standing facing this shadowy figure on a big screen television.
4947000	4948000	Talk to me.
4949000	4950000	All right.
4952000	4956000	I'll talk like this because I can't emulate like a computer voice thing,
4956000	4959000	like in, you know, the news when you're trying to hide your voice.
4959000	4960000	That's what this guy sounds like.
4960000	4964000	OK, can we do that in post for the for the podcast for future episodes?
4964000	4966000	Do we have that effect in board?
4966000	4968000	I could like get an app for it or something.
4968000	4969000	I don't know.
4969000	4970000	I'll figure it out.
4970000	4971000	That'd be fun.
4972000	4973000	Never mind.
4974000	4975000	You thought you could just.
4975000	4976000	I did.
4976000	4978000	And it didn't come out the way I thought.
4978000	4980000	I'd be willing to hear more of that voice.
4981000	4982000	It's like a dying frog.
4982000	4983000	Mr. Johnson, you were saying.
4983000	4984000	All right.
4984000	4988000	My employers have taken a keen interest in better than life chips.
4988000	4989000	That's BTLs.
4989000	4993000	These data chips contain experiences beyond normal experience.
4993000	4998000	They inspire emotions impossible in normal brains and even out the rough edges.
4999000	5000000	Better than life.
5001000	5004000	Lately, experimental chips have been leaking out of the Redmond barons.
5004000	5007000	Crazy chips stronger than ever's.
5007000	5011000	We've heard rumors that these chips don't have side effects or addiction.
5012000	5013000	Just rumors, though.
5013000	5018000	We got a positive ID on an expert software engineer by the name of Baldwin Brown,
5018000	5022000	citing in and around an abandoned warehouse that's been beefing up security lately.
5022000	5025000	Head down there and capture Brown alive.
5025000	5027000	I want to know what he knows.
5027000	5030000	Scoop up all the BTLs you come across, and I'll bring them back.
5030000	5034000	I'll meet you there and I'll meet you at the drop zone with the payment.
5034000	5037000	After the fixer fee, I can offer five thousand each.
5037000	5042000	I'll throw in an extra thousand if you guys want to bring me back crates of BTLs.
5044000	5047000	Sounds good. How about you throw in an extra fifteen hundred?
5047000	5049000	All right, let me do this.
5049000	5051000	I'm rolling dice now.
5052000	5054000	How's your family?
5054000	5056000	Oh, it's good.
5058000	5061000	What was the amount that you said?
5061000	5062000	Fifteen hundred.
5062000	5063000	Nope.
5067000	5068000	All right.
5068000	5071000	We will keep that in mind with our timing.
5071000	5074000	Mercy, what does Baldwin Brown do again?
5074000	5075000	Who is he?
5075000	5078000	He's an expert software engineer.
5078000	5080000	Thanks, Mercy.
5081000	5083000	So what do you guys say?
5083000	5085000	Five thousand apiece.
5085000	5087000	I don't trust him.
5087000	5090000	But I'll do it because I need the money.
5092000	5094000	I tried to negotiate the bonus.
5094000	5096000	Can I...
5096000	5102000	I really think that this job sounds a little more dangerous than five thousand.
5102000	5104000	What's the currency?
5104000	5105000	Nuyen.
5105000	5107000	Oh, okay.
5108000	5111000	How about six thousand yerngen?
5115000	5118000	Well, that sounds a lot more agreeable.
5120000	5121000	Six thousand it is.
5121000	5122000	All right.
5122000	5124000	Nice, Mercy.
5125000	5127000	You got a great face.
5132000	5135000	I would also like to go on this mission.
5139000	5141000	Hey, Nightblade.
5141000	5143000	You're not fucked up again, are you?
5144000	5146000	Just once I'd like to go on a mission with you
5146000	5149000	where you're not totally blasted on cyber boos.
5153000	5156000	You're kettle trons and whatnot.
5160000	5163000	It's our neck we're risking out there, Nightblade.
5163000	5166000	No, I need the money and...
5170000	5173000	You don't look so good is what I'm trying to tell you.
5173000	5175000	Were you paying attention at all?
5175000	5178000	Repeat back to me what Mr. Johnson just asked us to do.
5178000	5181000	We were supposed to go get Bradley Woodford from the...
5183000	5185000	Baldwin Brown.
5185000	5188000	Baldwin Brown has been seen in a warehouse.
5188000	5189000	We're going to secure him.
5189000	5192000	He's an engineer from this place that makes these BTL chips.
5192000	5195000	We're going to grab him and any BTL chips we can.
5196000	5199000	But she called the currency nyungnyung.
5201000	5203000	And that's why I'm laughing.
5204000	5205000	All right.
5205000	5207000	Because it sounds like a cat food.
5209000	5210000	What is it?
5210000	5211000	Nuyen.
5211000	5212000	Nuyen.
5212000	5214000	Nobody tell her.
5215000	5216000	All right.
5216000	5218000	Hordegard, what do you say?
5218000	5223000	I have a feeling that this is something that we could do quite easily,
5223000	5229000	but we should go quickly because he is deteriorating this one on the right.
5230000	5232000	And we will need his...
5233000	5235000	He's talking to you, Nightblade.
5237000	5238000	You got...
5238000	5239000	Hordegard.
5240000	5242000	We will need his attributes in the first day of the approach.
5242000	5245000	You don't have to be a precog to see if this guy is fucked up.
5251000	5252000	You have to be a precog.
5252000	5254000	You guys have to worry about me, all right?
5255000	5259000	Someone go on their common link and find out how far away the Redmond Barrens are.
5259000	5261000	Not far.
5261000	5263000	Just an Uber right away.
5263000	5265000	Shall we hop in an Uber?
5265000	5266000	Sure.
5266000	5267000	Sure.
5267000	5268000	Who calls them?
5268000	5270000	The Fixer, perhaps? Will he do this?
5270000	5272000	There's an app for that.
5272000	5276000	I open up the Uber app in my brain.
5281000	5283000	It's the future.
5284000	5287000	Just on your cell phone, on the comm link.
5287000	5288000	Oh, okay.
5288000	5294000	I open up the Uber app and I request an Uber.
5295000	5298000	An Uber arrives post-haste.
5300000	5301000	Our Uber's here.
5306000	5307000	I get in.
5308000	5313000	Yeah, we exit the last stand. What's it called?
5313000	5314000	Hank's Last Stand.
5314000	5316000	All right, we're going to Uber.
5316000	5317000	All right.
5318000	5320000	Give me all your gum.
5321000	5322000	Wait, what?
5322000	5323000	Excuse me?
5323000	5324000	I'm saying that to the Uber driver.
5324000	5326000	There is no Uber driver.
5326000	5327000	Oh, okay.
5330000	5331000	I see.
5331000	5332000	All right, sorry.
5332000	5336000	I say that and then I laugh and I'm like, oh, it's a dream I have.
5337000	5340000	Sometimes I play out the dreams that I have.
5340000	5342000	What's the plan when we get in on you guys?
5342000	5343000	What's the plan of attack?
5343000	5344000	Yeah, you might want to.
5344000	5346000	Yeah, we got to figure this out.
5346000	5348000	Okay, so there's this warehouse.
5348000	5352000	This guy's holed up in it and we want to just nab him.
5352000	5353000	We don't want to kill him.
5353000	5357000	Have it drop us off on a side street, first of all.
5357000	5358000	We are shadow runners.
5358000	5360000	We should come out in the shadow.
5360000	5361000	Of course.
5362000	5363000	Absolutely.
5363000	5366000	When we get there and sidebar table talk.
5366000	5368000	This is my first time playing a magic user.
5368000	5370000	It's going to be a learning curve for me on this one.
5370000	5371000	I've read a lot.
5372000	5376000	I'll try to astroly perceive or to astroly project when we get there
5376000	5380000	to go inside the warehouse to see what's going on.
5380000	5381000	Oh, that's fantastic.
5381000	5384000	Should we nab him or are we just getting something from him?
5384000	5387000	We're going to nab him and as many BTL chips as we can get our hands on.
5387000	5390000	He's the package for the Johnson.
5390000	5391000	Right, right.
5395000	5399000	I have extraordinary physical stealth skills.
5402000	5404000	I'm very stealthy as well on Agile.
5405000	5408000	Also, I can make myself invisible and levitate and shit like that.
5408000	5411000	I'm not as familiar with Hordekai's skill set.
5411000	5412000	Hordegard.
5414000	5416000	I have several items at my disposal.
5416000	5417000	I will keep them to myself.
5417000	5419000	It is a private inventory.
5419000	5422000	But you should know my reputation obviously precedes myself.
5422000	5424000	I would not be part of the team.
5424000	5425000	No, of course.
5425000	5427000	I have certain precognition skills.
5427000	5431000	I also have presets that allow me to enhance my physical abilities
5431000	5432000	and mental abilities.
5432000	5435000	And I can probe mines if we get one and settle somebody down
5435000	5437000	and need to know what's happening.
5437000	5438000	That's great.
5438000	5440000	Can you precog what's going on inside that warehouse right now?
5440000	5442000	Can you foresee the...
5442000	5444000	I can use general perception,
5444000	5449000	but precogging requires me to retire somewhere and to find a good sound system.
5449000	5450000	All right.
5450000	5455000	If this is going to be all muscle and agility, I'll stand outside and...
5456000	5458000	We look at a map of the city.
5458000	5459000	Okay.
5459000	5460000	We're in Seattle.
5460000	5461000	Yep.
5461000	5463000	And we look at where this warehouse is.
5463000	5464000	All right.
5464000	5468000	Can we pick a spot that looks like we could get maybe a good vantage point
5468000	5473000	physically, like, you know, safe, totally safe, not trying to...
5473000	5476000	I have a no soft for the city of Seattle in my mind.
5476000	5479000	I can look at the building and also its sort of physical plant
5479000	5481000	and no certain points of entry.
5481000	5482000	Any adjacent buildings?
5482000	5483000	Pass that to Demorsch.
5483000	5484000	Whoa!
5484000	5485000	Here's a map.
5485000	5487000	It's the first map.
5487000	5488000	It's the deal.
5490000	5491000	Okay.
5491000	5492000	To Demorsch.
5492000	5494000	I love that you're not excited about it.
5496000	5497000	He has the map.
5497000	5498000	You don't have the map.
5498000	5500000	We got a whole... Okay, so...
5500000	5502000	I'm sensing that the map is stuck in translation.
5502000	5504000	Could I please maybe get it to myself?
5504000	5505000	I'm looking at the map.
5505000	5506000	Hold on.
5507000	5508000	It's a train.
5508000	5509000	It's not yours to have.
5511000	5513000	I'll have them up for download after the show.
5513000	5514000	Okay. All right.
5515000	5516000	All right.
5516000	5518000	It's... The compound is...
5518000	5519000	I don't think we're supposed to see it.
5519000	5520000	It's not...
5520000	5522000	Demorsch is supposed to... It's not you.
5522000	5524000	Oh, sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
5524000	5526000	It's fine. He can share, but afterwards...
5526000	5528000	If you could read my mind...
5529000	5531000	What a tale my heart would tell.
5531000	5534000	There's a warehouse surrounded by a large fence.
5534000	5536000	The whole area is in the barons.
5536000	5539000	It's just this destroyed, devastated area.
5539000	5541000	There's all sorts of squat shells of buildings
5541000	5544000	you can kind of hide out and scope out the place if you wish.
5544000	5547000	And that's where the uber kind of drops you off.
5547000	5551000	It's just in an alleyway kind of about 600 feet off.
5551000	5552000	What time of day is it?
5552000	5555000	It's about 6 p.m. It's getting dark.
5555000	5557000	Okay. Shadows are coming out.
5559000	5562000	Don't worry. You know us elves in our low-light vision.
5569000	5571000	I have cyber eyes.
5574000	5575000	So from your vantage point,
5575000	5577000	you can see the low-roofed warehouse.
5577000	5579000	It's on a big hunk of land,
5579000	5582000	fenced off by a 10-foot-tall fence
5582000	5584000	topped with knife wire.
5584000	5586000	You see shattered, burnt-out buildings
5586000	5588000	all over the place, surrounding the lot.
5588000	5590000	And through the fence, you see the warehouse
5590000	5592000	with a loading dock for trucks.
5592000	5594000	The only entrance you can see on the compound
5594000	5595000	is on the south side.
5595000	5598000	There's a big gate controlled by a small gatehouse.
5598000	5600000	Far from state-of-the-art security,
5600000	5603000	the fence looks old, and you only see three armed guards
5603000	5605000	commanding the gate with submachine guns.
5605000	5607000	One bulky security camera on the fence
5607000	5610000	surveys the road leading up to the gate.
5611000	5612000	Someone's got to take out that.
5612000	5614000	Somebody needs to take out that camera.
5614000	5616000	Well, first let's talk about these fences.
5616000	5617000	Yeah.
5617000	5620000	Like the ones that don't have a gate on them,
5620000	5623000	like what keeps one from getting in?
5623000	5624000	What are they?
5624000	5626000	Linked chains.
5626000	5628000	It's a chain-link fence.
5628000	5630000	And they're high, and they have...
5630000	5632000	They're 10 feet tall, topped with knife wire.
5632000	5633000	Knife wire.
5633000	5634000	Yep.
5634000	5635000	That's a real thing.
5635000	5636000	Yeah.
5636000	5638000	BFD.
5638000	5640000	To a guy like me.
5640000	5643000	Can I go up to the fence without being seen?
5643000	5645000	Which fence?
5645000	5648000	Not the one by the guards, but like farther away from them.
5648000	5649000	Yeah, probably.
5649000	5651000	I go up there to check it out to see.
5651000	5654000	You've got to stealthily sneak up to see if there's any sensors,
5654000	5656000	like wires connected to it, if it's electrified or anything.
5656000	5658000	What's your agility plus sneaking?
5658000	5660000	Um...
5660000	5661000	Quick.
5661000	5663000	Okay, don't make me rush.
5663000	5667000	Agility is four, and my sneaking is...
5667000	5669000	Six.
5669000	5671000	All right.
5671000	5673000	You'd do it without being seen.
5673000	5674000	Fuck yeah.
5674000	5676000	You're up on a fence.
5676000	5679000	You're right by the knife wires.
5679000	5682000	I try to use perception on the fence and see what's going on,
5682000	5685000	if there's any hidden sensors or things that might trip.
5685000	5687000	You don't see any sensors.
5687000	5689000	It's pretty rusted and old, actually.
5689000	5690000	All right.
5690000	5692000	I'll go back to the group and relay that information.
5692000	5694000	Mm-hmm.
5694000	5695000	Hey.
5695000	5700000	Listen, don't run up to shit like that without us making a plan.
5704000	5706000	You don't owe me Nightblade.
5706000	5709000	I lived alone in this town for four years.
5709000	5712000	I'm a man without a past!
5712000	5716000	All right, look, we know that the two of you have...
5716000	5718000	The two of you have this will-they-won't-they
5718000	5720000	bullshit.
5720000	5724000	Let's cool it for a second and focus on the task at hand.
5724000	5726000	Just say we're going to work as a team, you know?
5726000	5729000	All right, well, cool it, Nightblade.
5729000	5730000	Cool it or tell it.
5730000	5731000	Tell it to her to cool it.
5731000	5732000	I take the note.
5732000	5734000	All right.
5734000	5738000	So I'm wondering, you know, I got a nano whip in my fingertip compartment.
5738000	5740000	We all know.
5740000	5743000	Yeah, like, that's the first time we've heard this story.
5744000	5752000	I'm not bragging, but I might be able to cut through the chain link, I'm not sure.
5752000	5757000	Do I know from experience if chain link is something that would thwart my nano whip?
5757000	5758000	No.
5758000	5760000	You know it would not do that, in fact.
5760000	5761000	I know it wouldn't thwart it?
5761000	5762000	Yes.
5762000	5765000	In fact, your nano whip would thwart the chain link.
5765000	5767000	Like a knife through butter.
5767000	5768000	Yep.
5768000	5770000	Like a knife through butter.
5770000	5777000	So we could go in, I mean, we could frag the three skis balls at the front gate.
5777000	5780000	I'd say it's better to go clean to the side.
5780000	5787000	I would suggest, perhaps, that we align ourselves directly in front of the security gate at a certain distance.
5787000	5792000	That we first toss into the compound, the security compound, a smoke bomb,
5792000	5799000	thus perhaps driving them out and perhaps each pick a target and shoot each of the three guards.
5799000	5802000	Let's listen to the Nazi doctor.
5802000	5807000	I'm worried that a smoke bomb will draw out all of the people inside as well.
5807000	5808000	The security guards.
5808000	5809000	Yeah, there's only three.
5809000	5810000	Only three.
5810000	5811000	But we know about.
5811000	5812000	We each take one shot.
5812000	5817000	Right, but I think that beyond those three, there's more in there.
5817000	5823000	The smoke bombs, that's going to say, hey, everybody inside the compound,
5823000	5827000	let's have all of you come out the front and deal with it.
5827000	5832000	Perhaps we can create a diversion.
5832000	5837000	Maybe I walk in, I'm wearing actioneer business clothes,
5837000	5841000	and we all know I have this face.
5841000	5846000	Maybe I talk to the guards while you come in through the side.
5846000	5851000	That's good.
5851000	5857000	So we got going in through the back door.
5857000	5866000	We got smoke bomb weird Atari 2600 take all comers at the front door.
5866000	5870000	I have improved invisibility where I'm invisible to guards and sensors.
5870000	5874000	Well, let's have Eve do that then.
5874000	5876000	Like walk through the front door?
5876000	5877000	Let's do that.
5877000	5881000	But if we take that choice, then I would choose then to use a silent,
5881000	5885000	I have a silent gun, a gun with a silencer, and I would use that.
5885000	5890000	Well, yeah, that's a good move.
5890000	5894000	I call him a mentor of spirit, Spencer, the Thunderbird for guidance on this.
5894000	5898000	Thunderbird's like, you should check it out first.
5898000	5900000	That's what I've been saying, Thunderbird.
5900000	5901000	Caw.
5901000	5902000	That's what I've been saying.
5902000	5903000	All right.
5903000	5906000	We're all able to be in constant contact with each other.
5906000	5909000	Yeah, you have your comm links and micro transceivers.
5909000	5911000	All right, everybody test your transceivers.
5911000	5912000	Test your transceivers.
5912000	5914000	Can you hear me, got me?
5914000	5915000	I got it.
5915000	5916000	Check one.
5916000	5917000	Check two.
5917000	5918000	Okay.
5918000	5919000	Check one.
5919000	5920000	He made my move.
5920000	5923000	I wonder if you feel like I'm part of a team.
5923000	5925000	I'm enjoying feeling part of a team.
5925000	5928000	I am enjoying it quite a bit.
5928000	5930000	Okay, good.
5930000	5932000	So that means we can split up.
5932000	5937000	I'm going to nano whip through the back door as it were.
5937000	5941000	And I'm going to, anybody I see, I'm going to take them out with stealth.
5941000	5948000	I think we should have an emergency code that we have in case the shit hits the fan,
5948000	5956000	in which case we all run or...
5956000	5960000	Yeah, we can't just run out and call an Uber.
5960000	5961000	Right.
5961000	5964000	This is probably the spot that we're in right now.
5964000	5965000	Here's what I say.
5965000	5970000	I say night blade, you go in, nano whip that fence, go in, see what you got.
5970000	5973000	And we need two people to cover the front gate.
5973000	5975000	So if anything goes weird with the guards there, we'll take them out.
5975000	5976000	That's true.
5976000	5978000	That's their only way out.
5978000	5980000	That's how we should be looking at this.
5980000	5985000	These guys are pigs in a pen.
5985000	5986000	What?
5986000	5987000	Wait.
5987000	5988000	What?
5988000	5991000	So you're saying that the two people on the outside need to be on the outside
5991000	5995000	because that's their only way out and we're going to execute the people that are leaving?
5995000	5998000	No, I'm saying we're going in there to get a guy.
5998000	6001000	The front gate is not important for us to get in,
6001000	6005000	but it is important for us to keep an eye on in case the guy we're trying to get tries to get out.
6005000	6006000	I see.
6006000	6007000	Okay.
6007000	6010000	I can stand at the front gate.
6010000	6018000	I can't do much physically aside from having a great face.
6018000	6022000	So I'll do that.
6022000	6027000	I just, that sounds fine.
6027000	6030000	I don't want to.
6030000	6032000	When the rest of the group settles on the plan,
6032000	6035000	I am fully equipped to do whatever the task is assigned to me.
6035000	6036000	Night blade.
6036000	6037000	And willing.
6037000	6038000	Night blade, you want to go try to get in.
6038000	6040000	And then keep us posted on the comm links.
6040000	6042000	And if there's trouble, we come charging in after you.
6042000	6043000	If not, we'll see what we see.
6043000	6045000	And then we'll take it from there.
6045000	6046000	All right.
6046000	6047000	Sound good?
6047000	6048000	I'm going to go in.
6048000	6049000	All right.
6049000	6050000	I'm going to nano whip the fence.
6050000	6051000	All right.
6051000	6053000	So there's multiple sides.
6053000	6055000	It's like a rectangle of a fence.
6055000	6057000	So northeast, south, or west.
6057000	6059000	I want to go in the west side.
6059000	6060000	All right.
6060000	6061000	Which side?
6061000	6062000	Okay.
6062000	6064000	Just so you know, just in the middle of that fence,
6064000	6066000	once you get over, there are crates.
6066000	6068000	If you need to scale them, you could perhaps arrange them
6068000	6070000	to get to the top of the warehouse.
6070000	6072000	Well, that may make a good visual cover for the hole
6072000	6074000	I cut in it.
6074000	6075000	It's good.
6075000	6076000	Do whatever you like.
6076000	6077000	Look for these crates that he's talking about.
6077000	6078000	Where are these crates?
6078000	6079000	You find the crates.
6079000	6081000	On this side of the fence, you're actually pretty
6081000	6083000	close to the warehouse itself.
6083000	6086000	There's only kind of a narrow five or six feet space.
6086000	6088000	And it's kind of packed with crates.
6088000	6089000	So yeah.
6089000	6090000	I like that.
6090000	6091000	Sounds like good cover.
6091000	6092000	Using the visual cover of the crates,
6092000	6096000	I nano whip a man-sized hole in the chain link.
6096000	6099000	You do that successfully, uniquely.
6104000	6106000	Slice.
6106000	6108000	You guys say that size hole.
6108000	6110000	With that, we are officially shadow running.
6112000	6113000	That's right.
6113000	6114000	That was the wrong hand.
6114000	6117000	My nano whip is in a fingertip compartment on my human arm.
6117000	6120000	My bionic arm is the other arm.
6120000	6122000	OK.
6124000	6125000	All right.
6125000	6126000	You're inside.
6126000	6127000	You're right next to this warehouse.
6127000	6129000	The property is big and deserted.
6129000	6132000	It's the perfect spot for secret research.
6132000	6135000	You can see an old rusted storage container on the far
6135000	6136000	side of the yard.
6136000	6138000	And trash litters the ground.
6138000	6141000	You're also right next to a shooting range with targets
6141000	6144000	and bullets and stuff.
6144000	6147000	I'm going to...
6147000	6149000	What's the nearest structure from these crates?
6149000	6151000	You're right next to the warehouse,
6151000	6153000	but you're not next to a door.
6153000	6155000	You don't see any doors on the side of the building you're on.
6155000	6158000	How far physically are we away from the guards at the front gate?
6158000	6163000	I mean, about 250 feet if you're kind of near where he is.
6163000	6164000	OK.
6164000	6166000	Do I see a way to...
6166000	6167000	Well, it doesn't matter.
6167000	6169000	I'm Jim Nightblade.
6171000	6175000	I want to go to the warehouse and use my grappling gun
6175000	6176000	to get to the roof.
6176000	6177000	All right.
6177000	6178000	You do that.
6179000	6183000	Guys, he's going in alone.
6183000	6185000	I'm going to go in with him.
6185000	6186000	All right.
6186000	6187000	Be careful.
6187000	6189000	If you follow him, please be careful.
6189000	6191000	If you go to the south on the outside,
6191000	6193000	there is a bit of a sinkhole.
6193000	6196000	And you might, as it gets darker, be prone to falling in.
6196000	6197000	So please be careful.
6197000	6198000	How do you know all this?
6198000	6199000	A perception?
6199000	6200000	I'm just going to...
6200000	6202000	I have the City of Seattle map.
6202000	6204000	And my mind is one of my no softs.
6204000	6205000	Oh, us?
6205000	6206000	OK.
6206000	6207000	That's very good.
6207000	6208000	Thank you.
6208000	6209000	Hordegard.
6209000	6211000	Hordegard, where's the best place for me to stand
6211000	6216000	if I'm standing in a position to talk to somebody?
6216000	6222000	If somebody's talking about guards or people who would...
6222000	6226000	The gate is on the south side, in the middle.
6226000	6229000	The road that leads to the front gate is the only way out
6229000	6230000	and the only way in.
6230000	6233000	And this in silence inside leads to the loading dock.
6233000	6235000	The gatehouse is next to that.
6235000	6237000	It's a century unit.
6237000	6239000	And it is separate, of course, from the gate,
6239000	6241000	just a century house with three guards inside.
6241000	6242000	OK.
6242000	6245000	I'm going to walk around in front of that...
6245000	6247000	You're saying the front gate?
6247000	6249000	It would appear to be a front gate,
6249000	6251000	but it's on the south side.
6251000	6252000	OK.
6252000	6255000	I'm going to walk around there with my...
6255000	6256000	I'm sorry.
6256000	6257000	What is it?
6257000	6258000	Selby?
6258000	6259000	What is the cell phone?
6259000	6260000	Comlink.
6260000	6261000	Comlink.
6261000	6262000	Sorry.
6262000	6263000	Almost had it.
6264000	6267000	I'm going to have my Comlink up
6267000	6269000	and make it look like I'm standing there,
6269000	6271000	like, waiting for somebody to pick me up.
6271000	6273000	So I will be in disguise.
6273000	6274000	All right.
6274000	6277000	As you approach, you're still a good 40 yards off
6277000	6280000	and the guards turn and aim their submachine guns at you
6280000	6281000	and start yelling,
6281000	6284000	Hey, get back, get back, get back, get back, get back.
6284000	6286000	Oh, gentlemen, I'm sorry.
6286000	6287000	Get back.
6287000	6292000	I turn my face towards the angry gentleman.
6293000	6295000	Boys, boys.
6295000	6298000	Boys will be boys.
6298000	6300000	I'm so sorry.
6300000	6306000	My son is being brought here to me.
6306000	6307000	Oh, God.
6309000	6310000	Screwed it up.
6310000	6314000	I'm sorry, gentlemen.
6314000	6318000	I'm just a lady a little lost.
6318000	6321000	And I will all back away.
6321000	6325000	Is it okay if I just stand kind of here?
6325000	6329000	Because this is where I've told my son's father to meet me.
6329000	6330000	We're no longer together.
6330000	6333000	What a bastard.
6333000	6336000	I know how that goes.
6336000	6337000	No way.
6337000	6338000	You don't know how that goes.
6338000	6342000	You're too handsome to ever be alone.
6342000	6347000	I think that most of the time.
6347000	6348000	I don't want to be forward,
6348000	6350000	but with your beard and your looks,
6350000	6352000	you look like a lumber sexual.
6352000	6355000	Oh, I'm clean shaven.
6355000	6357000	Clean shaven.
6357000	6361000	That's right.
6361000	6362000	All right.
6362000	6366000	Well, sir, if you don't mind me standing here with my phone
6366000	6369000	and occasionally looking over at you and fantasizing,
6369000	6371000	then I think we're good.
6371000	6374000	Well, that sounds mighty fine.
6374000	6377000	All right.
6378000	6380000	Nightblade, what do you see in there?
6380000	6381000	You're on a roof.
6381000	6385000	I'm on a roof.
6385000	6389000	Are there windows on the outside of the structure?
6389000	6391000	No, it's a windowless building.
6391000	6392000	All right.
6392000	6394000	I climb the rope up there with them.
6394000	6398000	All right.
6398000	6400000	Oof.
6400000	6403000	You climb up, but you slip and fall on your face
6403000	6405000	right at the top.
6405000	6406000	Am I on the roof?
6406000	6407000	Yeah.
6407000	6408000	Am I hurt?
6408000	6409000	Nope.
6409000	6410000	Okay.
6410000	6411000	You just made a noise.
6411000	6414000	Oops, sorry.
6414000	6416000	I used my grappling gun.
6416000	6417000	Well, you were already...
6417000	6419000	Wait, how?
6419000	6421000	No, I mean, I'm just explaining to her.
6421000	6422000	Oh, okay.
6422000	6425000	I used my grappling gun.
6425000	6428000	I examine the rooftop for any sort of skylights
6428000	6430000	or any sort of ingress.
6430000	6433000	You don't see any skylights, but you do see...
6433000	6434000	It just looks like a...
6434000	6435000	What do you call it?
6435000	6436000	Like a grate?
6436000	6438000	Yeah, just a grill, like a grate.
6438000	6440000	It's screwed on tight.
6440000	6441000	See that grill?
6441000	6442000	Yeah.
6442000	6446000	Let's get a closer look.
6446000	6447000	It's just a grill.
6447000	6450000	It's a Phillips head screws bolted.
6450000	6456000	You know what that looks like to my nano whip?
6456000	6462000	More butter?
6462000	6467000	Looks like we will be conceiving tonight.
6467000	6470000	Looks like butter.
6470000	6474000	I mean, I don't have any tools for screw...
6474000	6475000	Screws?
6475000	6477000	Do I have like a screwdriver?
6477000	6478000	I don't know.
6478000	6479000	I don't think so.
6479000	6480000	It'd probably say something like that.
6480000	6482000	Do you have a screwdriver?
6482000	6488000	I don't have a screwdriver.
6488000	6490000	If you're out there and you're listening,
6490000	6493000	you can proceed north on top of the building.
6493000	6497000	There is some sort of a loading dock there.
6497000	6502000	If you can drop down there, you can find ingress or egress,
6502000	6505000	perhaps, if you are inside, but you would find ingress.
6505000	6506000	Let's not get caught up on that.
6506000	6509000	But I'm just saying.
6509000	6512000	The structure is there, perhaps an easier one,
6512000	6513000	but perhaps also one that is guarded.
6513000	6514000	All right.
6514000	6516000	Nightblade, let's sneak to the north side of the building,
6516000	6517000	go to that loading dock.
6517000	6518000	What about the grate?
6519000	6521000	We don't have the tools, man.
6521000	6522000	I got a nano-whip.
6524000	6525000	Look, Nightblade...
6525000	6530000	Can I use my combat sense to see what troubles might befall them?
6532000	6536000	You can sense that they're not in any immediate danger at the moment.
6536000	6539000	I sense that you are not in any immediate danger,
6539000	6542000	but don't hold me to that.
6544000	6547000	If you want a nano-whip that great, I'm not going to stand on your way.
6547000	6549000	That's what she said.
6550000	6552000	Sorry, I'm so sorry.
6554000	6556000	We talked about harassment on the runs.
6557000	6559000	Let me just take a peek.
6561000	6563000	I nano-whip the grate.
6564000	6565000	All right.
6566000	6568000	Yep, you nano-whip the grate.
6570000	6572000	Wrong finger, wrong finger, wrong finger.
6573000	6578000	You slice a hole in it, and it's kind of like a can,
6578000	6580000	where it's hanging by a little thread, you know?
6580000	6581000	Nice.
6581000	6584000	How's the size?
6585000	6587000	It's man-sized.
6588000	6590000	I got a man-sized grate.
6593000	6597000	Why don't you take a peek and take a little gander down there, Nightblade?
6599000	6601000	I start going in the grate.
6603000	6604000	Wait, you do what?
6604000	6605000	I go in.
6605000	6606000	Oh, you go in.
6607000	6609000	Well, it's just kind of like a hole in the ceiling.
6609000	6612000	If you go in, you'd just be kind of like dropping through a hole.
6613000	6614000	Is that what you do?
6614000	6617000	Oh, you mean like down below is the warehouse itself?
6617000	6618000	Yeah.
6618000	6621000	Oh, then let me look and get a lay of the land.
6622000	6623000	You do that.
6623000	6628000	You see a card table with two guys playing cards and drinking alcohol.
6628000	6630000	They're not seeming to pay much attention.
6630000	6632000	They got their pistols on the table.
6632000	6633000	I got two bogeys.
6635000	6638000	You also see two semi-trucks and crates all over the place,
6638000	6640000	and a forklift in one corner.
6641000	6643000	Two bogeys playing cards.
6643000	6645000	That's all I got in here.
6646000	6648000	Porter, what do you see down there?
6648000	6650000	Anything else we need to know about?
6650000	6652000	Our own vision good enough there, Spencer.
6652000	6653000	What?
6653000	6656000	To see around inside the warehouse.
6656000	6657000	You see the things I said.
6657000	6659000	There's nothing else to see.
6659000	6663000	So can I use my grappling gun to descend like Spider-Man?
6663000	6669000	Well, you can hook it on something and then climb down on the rope,
6669000	6672000	like tying a rope to a fixed object.
6673000	6675000	How far away are they from us?
6675000	6676000	40 feet.
6676000	6678000	And how far is 40 feet down?
6678000	6680000	No, I mean it's diagonal.
6680000	6681000	Okay, so it's 20 feet or so down?
6681000	6682000	Yep.
6682000	6687000	So I can affix my grapple to the roof here and then descend with my grappling gun?
6687000	6688000	Yes.
6690000	6692000	I'm going to give it a shot.
6692000	6693000	All right.
6693000	6695000	I'll be right behind you if you need me, Nightblade.
6695000	6697000	What's your agility plus sneaking?
6697000	6699000	Get ready for go time.
6704000	6708000	I'd like this to be a black bag job, but it might be fracapalooza.
6710000	6713000	My agility is...
6713000	6715000	It's me, Dan.
6715000	6719000	My agility is five and my...
6719000	6720000	What was the other thing?
6720000	6721000	Sneaking.
6721000	6723000	Sneaking is...
6725000	6726000	Four.
6726000	6728000	And then it says parentheses plus four.
6728000	6730000	Okay.
6730000	6732000	That's sneaky.
6732000	6733000	All right.
6733000	6736000	You descend unseen or heard.
6736000	6739000	You're right above the floor.
6739000	6741000	You can touch the floor if you want.
6741000	6742000	Okay.
6742000	6744000	Oh wait, you're off the thing before I descend after you.
6744000	6747000	I touched it.
6747000	6752000	I leave my grapple so that my friend can come down too.
6752000	6754000	You do that quietly.
6754000	6756000	I descend as well.
6756000	6757000	That happens.
6757000	6758000	Okay.
6758000	6760000	They don't see us?
6760000	6761000	They don't.
6761000	6764000	They're not paying close attention apparently.
6764000	6765000	What do you think?
6765000	6769000	I can stun these guys and knock them out with a stun bolt from a distance if you want.
6769000	6771000	Let's check in with the team.
6772000	6773000	Come on, chuckleheads.
6773000	6774000	Talk to me.
6780000	6782000	Sounds good.
6782000	6788000	Once again, if I could tap into combat sense to see what sort of risk they are in.
6788000	6791000	They might be in danger if they screw up.
6791000	6793000	They're in more immediate danger than they were before.
6793000	6797000	Can we pull up an image of this guy, of this Baldwin character we're looking for?
6797000	6800000	Is there a photo online of this guy that we can see so we know we're looking at the right guy?
6800000	6802000	Yeah, you do that.
6802000	6806000	He looks like an aging bald man with glasses.
6806000	6808000	Does he look like one of those guys playing cards there?
6808000	6810000	No, these are young dudes.
6810000	6815000	There's a 20-year-old orc and then a 20-ish-year-old human.
6815000	6818000	What kind of non-lethal...
6818000	6819000	I got loads.
6819000	6822000	I can knock him out with a stun bolt if you like.
6822000	6823000	Both of them?
6823000	6826000	Yeah, it's an area spell.
6826000	6828000	Stun bolt is not an area spell.
6829000	6830000	Stun ball, I mean.
6830000	6831000	There you go.
6831000	6832000	Stun ball?
6832000	6834000	You think you can take two of them out with a stun ball?
6834000	6837000	I mean, let's not waste my spells if we don't have to.
6837000	6839000	It drains a magician to use that stuff.
6839000	6841000	Do you think we could do that right away?
6841000	6845000	I think it's worth it to try as hard as we can to go non-lethal.
6845000	6847000	I mean, we only see these two people.
6847000	6849000	Let's try to stun ball them.
6849000	6851000	All right.
6851000	6852000	You sure?
6852000	6856000	Hold on, I'm getting a sim sense.
6856000	6857000	Do you boys need help in there?
6857000	6861000	I have stealth that can maybe help you out if you need some backup.
6863000	6867000	Aren't you at the front gate just flirting?
6868000	6871000	I don't like it when you degrade what I do, but yes.
6871000	6872000	Yes, that is what I am doing.
6872000	6873000	Well, stay there.
6873000	6874000	Keep them occupied.
6874000	6876000	Nightblade, I also have an X-Shock or Taser gun,
6876000	6880000	but it's only a single-shot thing, so I can't get them both.
6880000	6884000	Well, I just think if your stun ball is a ranged thing
6884000	6888000	that could stun two people, that's perfect for these poker players.
6888000	6889000	I cast a...
6892000	6897000	I harness, first of all, my combat spell casting.
6897000	6904000	I touch my red feather earring and summon the spell casting focus
6904000	6910000	to increase my combat, and I throw a force three stun ball at the guards.
6910000	6911000	All right.
6911000	6914000	What's your spell casting plus magic?
6914000	6915000	11.
6915000	6916000	11, huh.
6917000	6919000	Do I get a plus two for the spell casting?
6919000	6922000	Yes, so that would be 13 all the way up.
6922000	6925000	Aaron asking, do you have just one earring?
6925000	6926000	Yes.
6926000	6927000	Which ear is it in?
6927000	6928000	It's my left ear.
6928000	6929000	Thank you.
6930000	6931000	All right.
6931000	6932000	Meet some parties.
6932000	6933000	Meet some parties.
6933000	6936000	So you fire off a stun ball.
6942000	6947000	It lands right in the middle of them, and it hits them.
6947000	6953000	They attempt to twist out of the way, and they take a lesser effect,
6953000	6955000	and they end up taking some damage.
6955000	6956000	Hold on.
6957000	6961000	There better be an app with all of Jeff's different magic noises in a human.
6961000	6962000	There better be.
6962000	6965000	She buried the lead on that spell.
6967000	6969000	It's a man of a stun ball I'm shooting.
6969000	6970000	It takes a lot out of you.
6971000	6973000	One of them goes down to the ground cold,
6973000	6976000	and the other one seems to have dodged out of the way.
6976000	6978000	Russian night blade.
6978000	6979000	Yeah.
6979000	6984000	When it's my turn, I'll use my silence-equipped Ares Predator 5
6984000	6986000	that's in my bionic arm.
6986000	6987000	All right.
6987000	6988000	You got the surprise on them.
6988000	6991000	So what's your pistols plus agility?
6992000	6996000	I mean, I'm assuming like I'm not close enough to him to do anything non-lethal.
6996000	6999000	I have a stun baton, and I mean, that's about it.
6999000	7002000	So what's your agility plus pistols?
7002000	7004000	Well, you're making me kill this guy.
7004000	7006000	Well, you said you were firing at him with your gun, right?
7006000	7008000	Well, I just wanted to make sure before I do that.
7008000	7010000	I wasn't close enough to him to stun baton him, right?
7010000	7011000	No.
7011000	7012000	You have the element of surprise.
7012000	7013000	I'm not.
7013000	7014000	Well, not anymore.
7014000	7015000	Now the stun ball's in play.
7016000	7018000	Adam, don't heckle the chimp.
7018000	7020000	I'm trying to save this guard's life.
7021000	7022000	Okay.
7022000	7023000	So, okay.
7024000	7025000	You need to know my name.
7025000	7027000	Adam's real born on the 4th of July right now.
7027000	7029000	I mean, shit's gone bad.
7029000	7031000	It's the first act of heat.
7031000	7032000	Shit's gone bad.
7032000	7034000	The cat's out of the bag.
7034000	7036000	I've got a stun ball.
7036000	7037000	I'll sleep like a baby tonight.
7037000	7038000	Okay.
7038000	7039000	So you're looking for...
7039000	7040000	Sorry.
7040000	7041000	One more time.
7041000	7042000	I'm a little drunk.
7042000	7043000	Agility plus pistols.
7043000	7048000	Agility is five, and pistols is two parentheses plus two.
7048000	7051000	Is there shorthand for those numbers when it's two?
7052000	7054000	Well, if it's plus two, then just add them all up.
7054000	7055000	Okay.
7055000	7056000	So five plus two plus two would be nine.
7056000	7057000	Okay, great.
7057000	7058000	Cool.
7059000	7060000	Ooh.
7060000	7061000	Yeah.
7061000	7062000	You plug them right in the face.
7068000	7070000	Wow, a little bit overkill, huh, Nightblade?
7071000	7073000	That's baton cleanup.
7074000	7075000	Yeah.
7075000	7078000	He gets shot in the face and goes down.
7078000	7081000	Every time you fuck up casting the spell, that's what it looks like.
7087000	7088000	It's a human cost.
7091000	7092000	Noted.
7094000	7096000	I go up there and secure their weapons.
7096000	7097000	All right.
7097000	7100000	You take two Ingram smart guns.
7100000	7101000	I'm hyper-vigilant.
7101000	7105000	I'm in a fucking PTSD, fucking 360.
7105000	7107000	My heart's beaten.
7108000	7114000	You see no one outside Mercy and Hordegard hear the report of a pistol.
7114000	7115000	Silencer.
7115000	7116000	Oh, then they don't.
7119000	7122000	I sense that something has gone down and I'm checking in.
7123000	7125000	Do you see crates?
7128000	7129000	Yeah, there's crates everywhere in here.
7129000	7130000	In the building.
7130000	7132000	This place is lousy with crates.
7133000	7134000	Yes, yes.
7134000	7136000	Yeah, you don't see anyone else in the room that you're in.
7136000	7138000	Are there any doors that we see along the walls?
7138000	7143000	There's a door to the east that's leading presumably out of the building.
7143000	7144000	There's a door to the south.
7144000	7146000	We should check these trucks.
7147000	7148000	Okay.
7148000	7149000	I mean, I will.
7150000	7151000	You go ahead.
7151000	7152000	I'm going to go.
7152000	7156000	There's one door that's presumably leaving at the loading dock or whatever.
7156000	7157000	Yeah.
7157000	7159000	And then the other one looks like it might be an interior room.
7159000	7160000	Yep.
7160000	7163000	I go to that door and take out my endoscope and put it under the door to take a look around.
7163000	7164000	You do that.
7164000	7168000	You see three large machines that look like they're producing something.
7168000	7171000	You don't know quite what from your low angle.
7171000	7175000	You also see a concrete barrier that blocks your vision towards the right.
7175000	7178000	It's kind of the only things you can see are those two things.
7179000	7180000	Machines and a barrier.
7180000	7181000	Okay.
7181000	7183000	I report that over to Nightblade.
7184000	7185000	What's in those trucks?
7186000	7187000	I'll go check these trucks.
7187000	7188000	They're full of crates.
7188000	7189000	The crates are sealed shut.
7190000	7191000	Boxes and boxes.
7195000	7196000	What was it?
7197000	7198000	Nabokov said?
7201000	7202000	Package is just a...
7205000	7207000	Package for a... package?
7215000	7217000	I've got a door over here at Nightblade.
7217000	7219000	I can't see the whole situation in here.
7219000	7222000	I said we come in there guns-a-blazin'.
7223000	7227000	I load my gun with stick and shock bullets.
7227000	7228000	You do that.
7230000	7231000	Well, hold on.
7231000	7237000	So the chickie pea's out front talking to these three guys.
7238000	7241000	If we take out those three guys, then she can come in.
7241000	7243000	It's like we got the whole yard covered, right?
7243000	7244000	We can all...
7244000	7247000	Like maybe we should take those guys out at the south gate.
7247000	7251000	Well, can I try just talking to them and see what happens?
7252000	7253000	See if I can get in.
7254000	7257000	I will choose to approach this cover.
7257000	7258000	Keep their attention.
7258000	7261000	You see if you can get all three of them to be talking to you,
7261000	7263000	all facing you at the same time.
7264000	7265000	None of them facing north.
7266000	7267000	All right.
7269000	7271000	I positioned myself south.
7278000	7279000	I'm so sad.
7282000	7288000	Oh, I just got the worst news.
7288000	7289000	I'm so sad.
7289000	7290000	I'm so weak.
7293000	7297000	The clean shaven guy comes over towards you and is like,
7297000	7298000	why are you weak?
7298000	7299000	Oh, hey.
7300000	7303000	My son that I was meant to meet here,
7303000	7308000	I guess he was killed by one of those dirty shadow runners.
7309000	7312000	Some shadow runner was on a run.
7315000	7317000	And my son was standing in the way.
7320000	7325000	I'm so sorry to ask this, but I've been going to this cybertherapy
7325000	7330000	that's where my cybertherapist told me that the only thing that could
7330000	7335000	calm me down was three men, one with two hands on my head
7335000	7338000	and the other two with two hands on either arm.
7338000	7342000	And this is so embarrassing, but if you could please just touch me.
7344000	7345000	Please.
7346000	7347000	He touches you.
7348000	7354000	Can you ask your friends to also touch me and just listen to me?
7354000	7355000	I guess I can do that.
7355000	7356000	Thank you.
7356000	7357000	I'm so sorry.
7357000	7359000	This is so embarrassing.
7359000	7363000	I am some distance away, but I am holding my rifle poised and I am
7364000	7365000	looking for an open shot.
7366000	7367000	Shouldn't opportunity presented.
7368000	7369000	So, um, okay.
7369000	7371000	Yeah, there's, there's some shots open.
7372000	7378000	Do I see the, I want to leave the warehouse through the, is there,
7378000	7381000	if I go towards the South, is that where the South gate is?
7382000	7385000	No, if you go towards the South, that's towards the door that he's,
7385000	7386000	he's poke.
7386000	7387000	He's peeking through.
7387000	7389000	That'll put us out towards the gate, right?
7389000	7390000	No, that's an interior door.
7390000	7393000	Oh, I'm looking to go toward Aaron.
7393000	7394000	All right.
7395000	7396000	Mercy.
7396000	7398000	You, you came in through the ceiling.
7398000	7399000	Right.
7399000	7400000	Are there where we are?
7400000	7402000	Are there any South gate is to the South, right?
7402000	7404000	Are there any businesses near?
7404000	7408000	Are there any businesses that we saw on the way over here in the Uber?
7409000	7411000	No, they're all, they're all destroyed.
7411000	7414000	They're just like destroyed, bombed buildings and stuff.
7414000	7415000	Okay.
7415000	7416000	All right.
7416000	7417000	I tried to find an exit from the warehouse.
7417000	7418000	Okay.
7418000	7419000	A different exit.
7419000	7420000	Yeah.
7420000	7421000	Okay.
7421000	7423000	One that provides me egress from the warehouse itself.
7423000	7425000	There's the loading dock.
7425000	7426000	That's where the trucks came in.
7426000	7427000	It's open.
7427000	7429000	So that's where Eve is.
7429000	7431000	No, no, I'm, I'm, I'm in another door.
7431000	7432000	I'll come with you over there.
7432000	7433000	Okay.
7433000	7435000	Uh, let's try the loading dock.
7435000	7438000	Is there, are there, do we, we know there's dudes there.
7438000	7439000	There aren't any dudes there.
7439000	7440000	All right.
7440000	7443000	Uh, so I'm just trying to get to the South gate.
7443000	7447000	Uh, if you exit the loading dock, you'll see a path, the winding path,
7447000	7448000	which leads you straight to the gate.
7448000	7450000	You will also pass a storage unit.
7450000	7454000	So perhaps you would be careful and perhaps check that out,
7454000	7457000	but, uh, usual priorities.
7457000	7458000	All right.
7458000	7459000	All right.
7459000	7463000	You exit the loading dock and you see the three guys touching a mercy
7463000	7465000	who's on the floor in pain.
7465000	7467000	What's the range?
7467000	7471000	200 feet and the backs backs to us.
7471000	7473000	Yeah.
7473000	7474000	All right.
7474000	7477000	Time to fucking like.
7477000	7480000	Can we synchronize so that we shoot at the same time?
7480000	7482000	We have to make sure that mercy ducks and gets, and then gets out of,
7482000	7483000	gets out of the way.
7483000	7485000	Well, she's out of the shot.
7485000	7486000	She's on the ground and stuff.
7486000	7487000	Oh, she is.
7487000	7488000	I think.
7488000	7489000	I am.
7489000	7492000	You like, you collapsed.
7492000	7493000	Yeah.
7493000	7497000	What's, what's an objective way of, of, of picking dudes?
7497000	7501000	Uh, like, like you get, you can't do like three o'clock, 12 o'clock.
7501000	7503000	Like, what do we, how do we, how do you go?
7503000	7504000	The two of you are together.
7504000	7506000	You both look at each other and say, I'll take this one.
7506000	7507000	I'll take that one.
7507000	7509000	I am not with you.
7509000	7512000	So I will take the one that is remaining.
7512000	7516000	I, Spencer, can I say to the gentleman?
7516000	7520000	Um, this is this, thank you.
7520000	7524000	I know this is such an inconvenience, but if, if the three of you,
7524000	7527000	and this is the way my therapist explained to me that it was the way
7527000	7528000	that this ended.
7528000	7534000	If, if the three of you could just turn towards each other and I will walk
7534000	7539000	away, symbolizing me, walk away, walking away from my pain.
7539000	7542000	If you just for a moment can link and just stare at the ground,
7542000	7544000	it will take just 30 seconds or so.
7544000	7546000	And I thank you so much.
7546000	7552000	And I, if, if I ever meet you again, I promise I'll be generous with my
7552000	7553000	kindness.
7553000	7554000	Lock and load, guys.
7554000	7556000	Lock and load.
7556000	7557000	You're already fine.
7557000	7563000	Just have, have each of them hold between one and three fingers up.
7563000	7567000	It's, it's too lengthy a process.
7567000	7569000	We'll take care of it.
7569000	7572000	I'm just having them, I'm just wanting to get away from this situation.
7572000	7573000	So they're just standing there.
7573000	7574000	All right, we'll go with Hordigam's plan.
7574000	7578000	I'll, I'll, I'll just, I'll just, I'll just, I'll just, I'll just kill
7578000	7583000	whoever I can and he'll kill, you know, we'll just start killing people.
7583000	7586000	I'm using, I'm using stick and shock on mine because I prefer,
7586000	7587000	I prefer non-lethal if I can.
7587000	7591000	Well, I, okay.
7591000	7592000	All right.
7592000	7594000	If you, if you want to go up there and cut those throats when I'm doing that
7594000	7595000	down.
7595000	7596000	I can't, I can't.
7596000	7597000	If I could get close, I would stun baton him.
7597000	7599000	I don't like to kill people.
7599000	7603000	The one you stun, I will take out.
7603000	7604000	I'm not, I'm not stunning anybody.
7604000	7605000	I'm not going to get that close.
7605000	7608000	I'm going to shoot, shoot them in the head with my gun.
7608000	7609000	All right.
7609000	7615000	I feel like, but could they really kill all guards at once?
7615000	7619000	Find out next time.
7619000	7625000	Thank you everybody.
7625000	7626000	Jamorage Brown.
7626000	7627000	Thank you so much.
7627000	7629000	Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Jamal.
7629000	7635000	Thank you for coming up.
7635000	7636000	I'm Jeff Davis.
7636000	7640000	Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.
7640000	7643000	Next week there'll be music for Shadowrun.
7643000	7644000	This is going to be very exciting.
7644000	7648000	If you want to know whose music we played tonight, I'm assuming there's
7648000	7649000	somewhere you can go, right?
7649000	7650000	Yeah.
7650000	7653000	We'll, we'll post that online for the, uh, uh, on the website and then we'll make sure
7653000	7654000	everybody knows about the music.
7654000	7655000	Yeah.
7655000	7661000	Did you get any of that?
7661000	7670000	It's a good show.
