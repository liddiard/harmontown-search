0	28600	Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Harmontown is now in session from the incredibly groovy Haysland
28600	33480	Theater in Pennsylvania, where apparently a production of Jailhouse Rock is going to
33480	34480	go on backrest.
34480	35480	I'm Jeff Davis, common shoulder.
35480	42480	Would you please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
42480	44480	Yeah.
44480	49040	Thank you.
49040	57120	Welcome to church.
57120	58120	This place is gorgeous.
58120	61160	This is a great theater.
61160	65320	It's very, very weird here tonight.
65320	69720	If you know me, then you're here.
69720	73920	If you know me and you live in Pittsburgh, you're here.
73920	79200	If you know me, then you know that I'm very almost annoyingly obsessive about story structure
79200	85680	and in relation even to my own physical activity in the course of my life and the course of
85680	91880	my evenings and often doing obnoxious things like pointing out that we've reached the goddess
91880	99600	point in this conversation or something stupid, a little Campbell flashing.
99600	103000	But this tour, I mean, we knew when we set out, like, okay, come on, this is going to
103000	104000	be a story.
104000	107080	Like every physical process you do, if you plant a potato and then dig it up and then
107080	110200	eat it and poop it out, you're telling a story.
110200	113840	And also if you zoom in on the process of digging up the potato, there's a story there.
113840	119920	And if you zoom in on the process of the first shovel dig, whatever individual shovel
119920	120920	dig is called.
120920	121920	Is that a scooch?
121920	122920	A splurch.
122920	123920	Okay.
123920	129920	You can buy in the lobby Jeff's new book of sniglets.
129920	132080	It's words that you didn't know existed.
132080	136440	But like, okay, so we've embarked on this tour.
136440	140080	We're almost, if not exactly, depending on where you define where the threshold's across
140080	143640	the beginnings, which shows you count, which ones you don't.
144640	145640	We're right about smack in the middle.
145640	146640	We're at the world navel here.
146640	150440	We are meeting with the goddess here tonight in Pittsburgh in this church.
150440	154520	And I don't make the decision for these things to happen.
154520	160360	I woke up this morning, like, I don't want to panic you, it's going to be a great show.
160360	164680	I woke up this morning depleted, like, for no, I don't even know, like, we've been having
164680	165680	a great time.
165680	170680	And it was just like, there's weird things that happen, like when you sleep on a bus,
170680	173080	I didn't even know this was a thing.
173080	176280	Your inner ear, I think, gets accustomed to the velocity.
176280	181640	Like what you used to call sitting still is now getting adapted into, you know, 70 miles
181640	182640	an hour.
182640	185640	And especially if you're sleeping during it, we have these little bunks on the bus.
185640	190560	I woke up in the hotel room this morning, and I could swear the entire hotel was driving
190560	191560	down the street.
191560	196640	And I'm having like these waves of vertigo because my inner ear is being ricocheted back
196640	197640	and forth.
197640	198640	Blah, blah, blah.
198640	200880	All kinds of physical reasons why we're meeting with the goddess tonight.
200880	205760	Like, I have been broken down as your hero.
205760	208920	Somebody went, pfft.
208920	215880	And that was the straw that broke me down as your hero, is that guy going, pfft.
215880	220160	I have been broken down physically.
220160	222240	We are achieving weightlessness here tonight.
222240	225920	The steps beyond us are going to be painful and weird and awesome.
225920	228440	They're going to involve God overtaking us.
228440	230960	I don't know if that happens here in this church, Jeff.
230960	231960	I think they have...
231960	232960	Was it a church?
232960	233960	Wasn't it?
233960	234960	What was this place?
234960	235960	Public theater.
235960	236960	A public theater.
236960	237960	It was never a church.
237960	238960	Oh, fuck it.
238960	239960	Never mind.
239960	240960	All right.
240960	241960	Let's just do some rapping.
241960	242960	No, no.
242960	243960	I...
243960	244960	Everybody kept saying it's a church.
244960	249840	I guess they're just commenting on the way it looks.
249840	251440	It's not a church, yo.
251440	253000	It's not a church, yo.
253000	254680	It's not sanctified.
254680	256240	It's not glorified.
256240	257840	This ain't a pulpit, yo.
258840	259840	I'm not chicken fried.
259840	261840	I'm not chicken fried.
261840	264840	I don't have God behind me on an altar.
264840	267840	I just want to talk, but now I'm starting to falter.
267840	270840	I fucked your mama in the front and in the back.
270840	274840	I fucked your mama because she had a heart attack.
274840	275840	All right.
275840	278840	So you can sense I've been broken down.
282840	285840	It's amazing that people clap for that.
286840	287840	It's magical.
287840	288840	Well, okay.
288840	290840	So that brings me to the bigger topic here.
290840	292840	It's like, okay, we're halfway through this journey.
292840	294840	So we've been performing in all these different cities.
294840	295840	We're meeting all these Armenians.
295840	296840	There's all this stuff.
296840	298840	If you listen to the show before we left,
298840	299840	Patton Oswell came out.
299840	301840	He warned us, like this Ian McKellen figure,
301840	304840	like you have no idea what lies beyond.
304840	308840	One does not simply walk into Phoenix.
308840	312840	He was coming from a comic standpoint and also like almost
312840	314840	a pre-podcast standpoint, kind of.
314840	317840	Like what we have is the same people from city to city.
317840	319840	I meet you guys after the shows.
319840	320840	I sign stuff.
320840	321840	I shake your hands.
321840	322840	I interact with you.
322840	323840	I cosmically intermingle.
323840	326840	And you're all not in a bad way.
326840	327840	You're all the same.
327840	329840	Like we have achieved.
329840	331840	We have data back.
331840	333840	The results are in.
333840	335840	We know what a Armenian is.
335840	338840	A Armenian is a loving nerd.
338840	342840	Like we have a definition now.
342840	345840	And that was one of the many things that...
345840	347840	So we've met with a goddess in that sense.
347840	348840	I know who you guys are.
348840	350840	I know that if you're being completely silent,
350840	351840	I'm not necessarily failing.
351840	352840	Yeah, you are.
352840	354840	Fuck you.
354840	355840	I know that I have...
355840	357840	You'll give me time to get around to my point.
357840	359840	I know that I don't have to pull out a rubber chicken.
359840	361840	I know who you guys are.
361840	363840	And I know where we stand with each other.
363840	365840	But yet we don't know who these particular...
365840	366840	Every audience...
366840	368840	Yes, I do, Jeff.
368840	369840	This is a steel driving town.
369840	371840	That's the only difference.
371840	373840	Steelers, baby.
373840	374840	Go Steelers.
374840	376840	Should we do a sports corner?
376840	379840	Dan Harmon, sports corner.
381840	383840	Dan Harmon, sports corner.
383840	385840	He knows all about sports.
385840	387840	He's got a Pittsburgh Steeler.
387840	389840	It's a tooth on his hat.
389840	392840	He's about to tell you about the Steelers chances
392840	396840	in the big game tomorrow.
396840	399840	Dan, what do you think about the Steelers this season?
399840	402840	Jeff, if I've said it again, I'll say it a thousand times.
402840	404840	Yardage, yardage, yardage.
404840	405840	All right.
405840	408840	You know, you've got Quintro on the tight end
408840	412840	and he's doing great, but he needs to be paired with Hodgkin's.
412840	415840	What do you think that the...
415840	417840	We talk about tight ends versus this.
417840	420840	What do you think the role of the tight end really is in an offense?
420840	422840	First and foremost, people don't agree with this.
422840	424840	It won't win me any popularity contest.
424840	425840	He's got to back up the linebacker.
425840	427840	He's got to be there for him.
427840	430840	And he's got to keep icing his knee.
430840	432840	You know, and he's got to be there to receive.
432840	436840	If the receiver fails, then the tight end has to back up the linebacker.
436840	439840	When the quarterback throws those missiles, as I call them,
439840	443840	especially with the Steelers, you know, you've got Hodgkin's on quarterbacker.
443840	448840	Like you either you're icing your knee or you're catching that ball.
448840	454840	What's your opinion about the Steelers secondary?
454840	456840	I think it's a bunch of trumped up stuff.
456840	458840	I think it's ruined the game for the fans.
458840	460840	Do you think there should be no secondary?
460840	462840	Yeah, I think it's a myth.
462840	466840	I think, look, I mean, we're familiar with the first quarter in football.
466840	469840	You know, we love the third quarter.
469840	472840	But, you know, there's four quarters to a game.
472840	474840	Why do you need to say secondary?
474840	477840	It's stupid. It's a foregone conclusion.
477840	479840	Let's break it into two halves, you know?
479840	484840	So, who do you like between the Falcons and the 49ers?
485840	486840	Schmitty.
486840	487840	Schmitty, okay.
487840	489840	Stompley.
489840	491840	The game was played today.
491840	493840	So, what do you take away from the Falcons?
493840	496840	Again, I hate to sound like a broken record.
496840	497840	Yardage, you know?
497840	500840	You've got to keep that ball moving down the field.
500840	503840	Who did you favor going into tonight's game?
503840	506840	At the top of the game, I would have told you, Scrimfrop.
506840	508840	No, I mean the team.
508840	509840	Falcons or Niners.
509840	512840	I thought under Scrimfrop's leadership, you know, as a coach,
512840	516840	they would have gone against the 49ers and taken away the Golden Sig.
516840	518840	You had the Falcons favored going in.
518840	520840	The Falcons? What?
520840	521840	Falcons and Niners.
521840	522840	Definitely Niners.
522840	524840	You had them favored going into the game.
524840	525840	Yeah, yeah.
525840	526840	So, how do you feel about the outcome?
526840	529840	Well, I think the Steelers did poorly.
529840	531840	Yeah, they certainly did.
531840	534840	They proved that games ago.
534840	535840	Yeah.
535840	538840	Anyways, Jeff, people put too much emphasis on it.
538840	540840	Dan Harbin, Game Corner, everybody.
541840	544840	He loves sports.
544840	545840	Yeah.
545840	546840	I love sports.
546840	547840	I love the Steelers.
547840	555840	I love sports because it's physical, and I'm very, very physical as a person.
555840	557840	You can tell from the sound of my voice.
557840	559840	Did you play a sport in school ever?
559840	560840	All of them.
560840	561840	I couldn't take my hands off of them.
561840	563840	People are like, Dan, you can only play one.
563840	565840	Please, sir, please let me play more sports.
565840	567840	This is my kind of people.
567840	575840	I just want to judge myself by how far a fucking ball I can hit with a stick or a club or my own hand.
575840	582840	Yes, I want to wrestle around in the dirt, and I want to feel bad if someone physically pins me down.
582840	588840	In addition to the actual pain of being physically pinned down, I want to actually feel emotional pain.
588840	593840	I want to feel like I let my father down by not being able to lift a brick.
593840	595840	What sport is that?
595840	599840	Pig skin.
599840	600840	It doesn't matter.
600840	603840	I was on a little league, or what do you call it?
603840	605840	They called it the Mighty Mites.
605840	607840	It was a YMCA basketball league.
607840	608840	A peewee baseball league?
608840	612840	Yeah, it was called the Mighty Mites, and I was on this basketball team.
612840	613840	I had no idea how to play basketball.
613840	615840	I would just walk around the court.
615840	616840	No one ever threw me the ball.
616840	619840	It was almost like a Globetrotters routine.
619840	623840	The way that they would beat the other team with only four players on the court,
623840	628840	I would just walk around like a rodeo clown, and every once in a while I'd accidentally catch the ball.
628840	635840	Then I would go, here we go, and I'd do something with a tweet immediately.
635840	639840	I would just cry on the way home, like, dad, why did you make me do this?
639840	640840	He's like, well, don't do it then.
640840	641840	I didn't ask you to do it.
641840	642840	Yeah, you did.
642840	644840	No, I didn't.
644840	645840	Mighty Mite basketball.
645840	646840	You ever play baseball?
646840	650840	I mean, I had to in gym.
650840	651840	I remember one time I hit the ball.
651840	656840	I actually hit it, and it went out into the thing, and I rounded first, and I rounded second,
656840	659840	and I was like, holy shit, how far did I hit this ball?
659840	660840	I rounded third.
660840	661840	I came all the way back to home.
661840	663840	I got a home run.
663840	666840	But Tim Kunkle, the catcher, was in tears.
666840	668840	I had thrown the bat.
668840	674840	Because I was so excited that I hit the ball, I had whipped the bat over my shoulder into his face or sternum or something.
674840	676840	He was in tears.
677840	680840	They banned me from baseball.
680840	682840	Everyone was booing me.
682840	687840	I just did this victory lap after clubbing a kid.
687840	692840	The guy had caught the ball, but he didn't throw it, because he was just like, holy fuck.
692840	694840	No, the game ended.
694840	696840	I ended baseball that day.
696840	697840	It was over.
697840	699840	There's no more baseball.
699840	702840	There's been a beating on the playground.
702840	703840	Was he wearing gear?
703840	705840	Did he have a helmet on and a chest pad or anything like that?
705840	707840	No, he's the grade schooler.
707840	709840	He's just sitting there behind the plate.
709840	710840	He wasn't fucking nobody.
710840	714840	So you just maimed a fucker and ran around like a champ.
714840	715840	And he was crying.
715840	718840	And then he started hitting me with his glove, and no one stopped him.
718840	720840	Because that was his right.
720840	722840	You go to prison and you're a pedophile.
722840	725840	The guards just let you get raped and murdered.
725840	728840	I had hit the kid with the bat, and he was a baseball player, and I wasn't.
728840	730840	So they just beat me.
730840	732840	No, I don't like sports.
732840	734840	I enjoy watching them.
734840	737840	I like watching baseball, as I kept explaining to these people.
737840	739840	I enjoy watching you do this.
739840	740840	I'm fascinated.
740840	741840	I think it's interesting.
741840	743840	There's no internet yet.
743840	745840	I will watch you do this.
745840	748840	Can I just watch?
748840	751840	Isn't there...
751840	756840	In the world of sports, isn't the role of spectator the most important?
756840	757840	Yeah.
757840	760840	If a tree falls on the forest and no one gives a shit.
760840	763840	Was it called PNC Park?
763840	764840	Was it called?
764840	765840	Yeah.
765840	767840	Most of it is seats.
767840	769840	Yeah, most of it is seats.
769840	770840	Very little of it is green.
770840	774840	It's mostly people watching.
774840	776840	Train us to get good at it.
776840	779840	Isn't that the whole point, to have the government indoctrinate you into patriotism,
779840	782840	using little secret flags instead of your own countries?
782840	785840	Oh, practice loving something other than your individuality
785840	788840	and the people that you know are human.
788840	789840	Tweet!
789840	792840	He did something good with his body, and it's good because the flag won.
792840	793840	Oh, there's a flag.
793840	794840	Love the flag.
794840	795840	Flag, flag, flag, flag.
795840	796840	Eat a hot dog.
796840	799840	You're a fucking zombie.
799840	800840	Your children are zombies.
800840	803840	You've been borgued without even knowing it.
803840	807840	Just by enjoying the beautiful ballet of talented people jumping around,
807840	815840	you have been inadvertently hypnotized by the Pentagon.
815840	819840	I'm coming down a little too hard on them.
819840	821840	I want to, speaking of things that I'm bad at,
821840	824840	I want to do an experiment tonight.
824840	825840	Rapping?
825840	827840	No, no, no, no.
827840	829840	Is there anybody, and this is just the first,
829840	832840	I'll explain in total what it is I want to do.
832840	836840	When people come up at Harman Time, we're not setting you up to fail.
836840	837840	We don't bully you.
837840	844840	But someone who has like a decent kind of street joke,
844840	848840	you know, like there was a guy and he went into a bar,
848840	850840	and then a duck had AIDS, that whole thing.
850840	851840	A joke joke.
851840	853840	Yeah, like a joke that you've heard, that you like,
853840	856840	that you feel pretty facile telling.
856840	860840	I want someone to come up, tell the joke, and that's chapter one,
860840	861840	and then we're going to give it some time.
861840	865840	I want to give it, because I want to create like a buffer there.
865840	867840	I'll listen to the joke.
867840	869840	And then later at some point in the show,
869840	872840	I'm going to try to tell the joke as hard as I can.
872840	874840	Which historically you're terrible at.
874840	875840	I'm the worst joke teller in the world.
875840	877840	It's amazing, not just you, but Dino Stamatopoulos,
877840	880840	Jay Johnson, funny people, funny writers that I know,
880840	881840	cannot tell a joke.
881840	882840	They can't tell a joke joke, right?
882840	884840	I get caught up in the details and I...
884840	886840	I think when you tell a joke,
886840	889840	you feel like the audience has been left behind
889840	892840	or that there's flaws in the joke structure
892840	894840	that need to be, like, to be spackled.
894840	897840	And so you end up just completely destroying
897840	899840	what could really be a four line joke,
899840	901840	and you make it a giant monologue of sadness.
901840	903840	Yeah.
903840	904840	But it's not going to happen tonight.
904840	906840	I'm going to try, because the fun of it is
906840	907840	I'm going to try as hard as I can to not do that.
907840	908840	But the first step is first,
908840	909840	we have to do it earlier in the show,
909840	911840	because then later I'll try to retell the joke.
911840	914840	Does anybody feel they can tell a volunteer to be the control group?
914840	915840	Do you want, like, a story joke?
915840	916840	Like, not like a three liner?
916840	917840	Not like a guy goes into a bar,
917840	918840	guy says this, the guy says blah?
918840	919840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
919840	921840	You want me kind of a story, yeah.
921840	924840	Like, the three things happen and then...
924840	926840	You come on up, sir, yeah.
926840	927840	What's your name, sir?
927840	928840	Justin.
928840	929840	Justin's coming to the stage.
929840	930840	Let's support him and love him.
930840	931840	Hi, Justin.
931840	932840	Hi, Justin, everybody.
932840	933840	All right, Justin.
933840	934840	I'm Jeff.
934840	935840	Nice to meet you, man.
935840	936840	Yeah.
936840	937840	Where are you from?
937840	938840	Originally, I'm from Binghamton, New York,
938840	939840	but now I live in Pittsburgh.
939840	940840	Yeah?
940840	941840	Yeah.
941840	942840	You enjoy it here?
942840	943840	I love it.
943840	944840	I moved here with my wife, and she's from here,
944840	945840	so from the north side.
945840	946840	What do you do?
946840	947840	Actually, I own Improv Comedy Theater in Pittsburgh.
947840	948840	Yeah.
948840	949840	I'm from Pittsburgh.
949840	950840	Yeah.
950840	951840	Yeah.
951840	952840	Yeah.
952840	953840	Yeah.
953840	954840	Yeah.
954840	955840	Yeah.
955840	956840	Yeah.
956840	957840	Yeah.
958840	959840	We have a ringer.
959840	960840	Yeah.
960840	961840	That's good.
961840	962840	That's good.
962840	963840	That's exactly what we want.
963840	964840	I felt like when you started describing what you wanted to do,
964840	965840	I was like, I know exactly which one I want to tell,
965840	966840	which is my grandma's favorite.
966840	967840	Do you know a lot of jokes?
967840	968840	I know a lot, but this is my grandmother's favorite one
968840	969840	I've ever done.
969840	970840	Okay.
970840	971840	Okay, good.
971840	972840	Grandma's favorite.
972840	973840	Fantastic.
973840	974840	Yeah.
974840	975840	I think it's in part because I have to do it with
975840	976840	a bad Irish accent, so...
976840	977840	I love it.
977840	978840	I love it.
978840	979840	Okay.
979840	980840	So that's...
980840	981840	I am opening my book.
981840	982840	I'm opening my book.
982840	983840	I'm opening my book.
983840	984840	I love it.
984840	985840	I love it.
985840	986840	Okay.
986840	987840	So that's...
987840	989840	So I am opening my buffers, and I'm going to receive this,
989840	991840	and I will tell this joke later.
991840	992840	Okay.
992840	994840	And I will be carried out on your shoulders.
994840	995840	All right.
995840	996840	All right.
996840	997840	Okay.
997840	998840	Sorry.
998840	999840	So far, so good.
999840	1000840	So far?
1000840	1001840	I blinked for a second.
1001840	1004840	All of a sudden, I realize all these people are looking at me.
1004840	1005840	Okay.
1005840	1008840	So there's a guy in a pub, right?
1008840	1009840	And it's closing time.
1009840	1010840	Dan, Dan, don't make a drink.
1010840	1011840	He's telling a joke.
1011840	1012840	Okay.
1012840	1013840	Okay.
1013840	1014840	All right.
1014840	1015840	Sorry, Dan.
1015840	1017840	So there's a guy in a pub, right, and it's the closing time,
1017840	1019840	and the bartender comes over and says...
1019840	1020840	What do they call it?
1020840	1021840	They don't call it a bartender.
1021840	1022840	What do they call it?
1022840	1023840	They can't remember the...
1023840	1024840	The Republican?
1024840	1025840	Right.
1025840	1027840	So the Republican comes over and says...
1027840	1028840	No, not a Republican, a Republican.
1028840	1029840	A Republican's a...
1029840	1032840	Oh, it's a public house, but there's a name.
1032840	1033840	I can't remember any.
1033840	1034840	A bartender?
1034840	1035840	There's another name for it.
1035840	1036840	It's like the...
1036840	1037840	What is it called?
1037840	1038840	A public house?
1038840	1039840	The what?
1039840	1040840	A waiter.
1040840	1041840	A waiter.
1041840	1042840	There's another name.
1042840	1043840	I can't remember.
1043840	1044840	It's like the landlord, I guess they say.
1044840	1045840	That's what they say.
1045840	1046840	Is your grandma here?
1046840	1047840	No.
1047840	1048840	She's no longer with us.
1048840	1049840	Do you want a drink, Justin?
1049840	1050840	You want vodka on the rocks?
1050840	1051840	I put this for you.
1051840	1052840	Okay.
1052840	1053840	Jeff was an asshole about me doing it.
1053840	1054840	No, no.
1054840	1055840	I wanted you to listen.
1055840	1056840	You did a very nice thing.
1056840	1057840	I'm listening.
1057840	1059840	I'm listening, and by the way, so far this is not going as planned.
1059840	1060840	That's fine.
1060840	1061840	That's fine.
1061840	1062840	That is also fine.
1062840	1063840	Okay.
1063840	1066840	What I have done is I have brought another Dan Harmon up on stage.
1066840	1068840	Pretty much.
1068840	1069840	But that's fine.
1069840	1070840	This could be...
1070840	1071840	I think about it all the time.
1071840	1073840	Actually, in college, my nickname was Tangent Boy.
1073840	1074840	So...
1074840	1075840	Okay.
1075840	1076840	So take a...
1076840	1077840	Okay.
1077840	1078840	Here we go.
1078840	1079840	Sorry.
1079840	1080840	Let's start from the beginning.
1080840	1081840	So there's a guy in a pub, right?
1081840	1082840	And it's closing time, and the bartender comes over and says, I'm sorry.
1082840	1083840	You got to go.
1083840	1084840	You got to go.
1084840	1085840	And the guy says, all right.
1085840	1086840	I'll go.
1086840	1087840	I'll go.
1087840	1090840	And he gets off the ball stool, and he falls flat on his face, right?
1090840	1091840	And the bartender says, oh, can I help you?
1091840	1092840	Can I help you?
1092840	1093840	No.
1093840	1094840	I'll be fine.
1094840	1095840	I'll be fine.
1095840	1097840	If I just get outside, I'll be fine.
1097840	1099840	So he crawls outside.
1099840	1102840	And he gets up, and he falls flat on his face, right?
1102840	1103840	And everybody says, oh, can we help you?
1103840	1104840	Can we help you?
1104840	1105840	I'll be fine.
1105840	1108840	If I just get to me flat, I'll be fine.
1108840	1109840	So he crawls to his flat.
1109840	1111840	It's only a couple of doors down, you know?
1111840	1114840	He crawls to his flat, stands up, falls flat on his face, right?
1114840	1117840	When he opens the door, and he falls flat on his face.
1117840	1121840	And he says, if I just get to me bed, he said to himself, if I just get to me bed, I'll
1121840	1122840	be fine.
1122840	1124840	So he crawls over to the bed.
1124840	1127840	He stands up, falls flat on his face, falls right to sleep.
1127840	1129840	Next morning, his wife wakes him up.
1129840	1130840	Come on, fucker.
1130840	1131840	Wake up, wake up.
1131840	1135840	And she says, well, I see you went to the pub last night.
1135840	1139840	He says, well, I had a few drinks, but how did you know I went to the pub last night?
1139840	1141840	You left your wheelchair there again.
1141840	1143840	All right.
1143840	1144840	Okay, good.
1144840	1147840	Justin, that's the control group for that joke.
1147840	1148840	That's the control.
1148840	1149840	Very nice.
1149840	1150840	Thank you, Justin.
1150840	1151840	Love it.
1151840	1155840	Yeah, what's your, I was just going to say, although now I hate you because you said it,
1155840	1157840	but I wanted to be gracious and say, do you want to plug your improv chair?
1157840	1158840	I would like to.
1158840	1161840	It's Steel City Improv Theater, steelcityimprov.com.
1161840	1163840	Oh, cool.
1163840	1167840	And actually this month we just moved to Shadyside, so we have an awesome bigger theater, so come
1167840	1168840	on by and check it out.
1168840	1170840	We have classes, fun stuff.
1170840	1171840	Okay, cool.
1171840	1172840	Thank you, Justin.
1172840	1173840	Justin, good luck on that, man.
1173840	1177840	All right, so just hit me later, like 10 minutes later.
1177840	1178840	Okay.
1178840	1179840	Let's move on.
1179840	1180840	I think I can nail that one.
1180840	1184840	I think I'll, my new goal is, I'm almost certain that you will not nail that joke.
1184840	1185840	Yeah, I will.
1185840	1186840	I know.
1186840	1188840	What you're going to do, because there are details, there's beats to that, and you're
1188840	1193840	going to, you're going to, first of all, timing will go out the window.
1193840	1198840	Timing will be the first casualty, and then you're going to, you're going to add, I'll
1198840	1200840	withhold my predictions.
1200840	1205840	I'm going to say a couple other beats are added into it that are extraneous.
1205840	1209840	It is a witch's tit cold here in Pittsburgh.
1209840	1211840	Pittsburgh invented the witch's tit.
1211840	1214840	This is from the official Wikipedia entry.
1214840	1218840	It's not as cold, you know, Milwaukee and Minneapolis people, they argue with each other.
1218840	1219840	I've noticed I'm from Milwaukee.
1219840	1224840	Every time you meet someone from Minneapolis, you, they are still fighting, it's colder
1224840	1228840	in Milwaukee, it's colder in Minneapolis, because they're the two coldest cities, like
1228840	1231840	including Windchill.
1231840	1236840	But Pittsburgh, here's my point, like we are now, we're rounding this bend where we're
1236840	1240840	getting closer and closer to the cold of my childhood.
1240840	1243840	There's different textures, different kinds of cold.
1243840	1249840	As I was explaining to my largely equatorial girlfriend, a Navy kid, Erin McGathey, who
1249840	1251840	spent, you know, went to high school in San Diego.
1251840	1256840	She's never, she was playing with snow, like when we got to wherever it was, there was
1256840	1258840	the first snow on the ground, and she's like, do you want to touch it?
1258840	1260840	I'm like, we go way back.
1260840	1264840	She actually, we're on the bus, she's like, Jeff, have you ever seen snow before?
1264840	1268840	No, never saw it.
1268840	1271840	She was amazed by it, she made a little tiny snowman, or Spencer did.
1271840	1275840	Anyways, as I was explaining to her, like, there's cold, and then there's like, there's
1275840	1279840	a cold where you shiver, because it's like cold on your body, it's cold, your skin's
1279840	1282840	cold, little things are happening to my body, because my skin's so cold.
1282840	1287840	And then there's the cold, my soul is cold.
1287840	1290840	My feelings are cold.
1290840	1294840	I remember moving from Milwaukee to Los Angeles the day before that happened, when I made
1294840	1299840	my final decision, I was chiseling my car out of ice, and I reached over to open the
1299840	1306840	door, and the metal hinge snapped off in my hand, because not only did God not intend
1306840	1312840	humans to live in that climate, but Newton didn't design metal to...
1312840	1316840	That was Carnegie.
1316840	1320840	Yeah, and I remember just laughing at the sky and going, I'm going to LA!
1320840	1324840	But anyways, it's bringing back, this is another reason why it's meeting with the
1324840	1327840	goddess tonight, is because it's reminding me of my childhood.
1327840	1330840	I'm bundled up, and I can't get warm enough.
1330840	1333840	I don't know if I have a fever, or chills, or something's happening to me.
1333840	1335840	Did you take the medicine I gave you?
1335840	1336840	Yes, I did.
1336840	1337840	That'll do it for you.
1337840	1338840	I don't know, man.
1338840	1342840	I don't know what's happening to me.
1342840	1348840	I'm at a point in his nose.
1348840	1350840	I want to do an experiment.
1350840	1352840	I want to tell you a story before...
1352840	1355840	Is it about a guy that goes into a bar?
1355840	1360840	No, I want to tell you something, because I came out, I had tears in my eyes,
1360840	1366840	right before I came out, because I was thinking about sharing a thing with you guys
1367840	1370840	that happened to us in...
1370840	1372840	Where the hell were we last?
1372840	1374840	Jesus.
1374840	1375840	Arlington, thank you.
1375840	1381840	The ghost of the Phantom of the Non-Church called out from the rafters.
1381840	1383840	We're going to do Jesus Christ Superstar later.
1383840	1385840	There's these cool platforms.
1385840	1387840	Really, we could do a scene from Rent.
1387840	1388840	Has anybody ever been in Rent?
1388840	1390840	Or possibly West Side Story?
1390840	1392840	We could do all kinds of shit here.
1392840	1395840	I'm going to see if I can cry on stage, Jeff.
1395840	1396840	Like drop a tear?
1396840	1401840	Because I haven't shared this yet because I keep telling people about it
1401840	1402840	and then I start crying.
1402840	1405840	You don't mean as a party trick to produce a tear for us?
1405840	1408840	You're saying, can you actually break down emotionally and start crying?
1408840	1409840	Both.
1409840	1410840	It's a party trick, isn't it?
1410840	1412840	Isn't that what emotions are?
1412840	1415840	Are you saying you want to prove to an audience that you're capable,
1415840	1417840	that you have that range, that you could do that?
1417840	1421840	Or that you want to prove that you're capable of revealing yourself that way?
1421840	1422840	I want to see if it's possible.
1422840	1423840	Both.
1423840	1425840	I want to see if it happens.
1425840	1427840	Because I've told...
1427840	1431840	Our friendship, Esten, can cry, can make a tear come out of his eye in 10 seconds.
1431840	1433840	No, I'll never be able to do that.
1433840	1437840	But I just want to see if the lights and the microphone
1437840	1439840	and the idea that I'm doing a performance and a podcast
1439840	1444840	actually get in the way of what keeps happening every time I tell a story to an individual.
1444840	1445840	What's the time limit on this?
1445840	1447840	Or is there no time limit?
1447840	1448840	Time limit?
1448840	1449840	Yeah.
1449840	1450840	I don't know.
1450840	1451840	No time limit.
1451840	1453840	You're such a crass, coarse man.
1453840	1456840	No, I'm saying, like, I want to make it interesting.
1456840	1457840	Volcan.
1457840	1462840	20 bucks says you can't cry for nice people.
1462840	1463840	All right.
1463840	1464840	Well, so this guy...
1464840	1465840	Yeah, but that's making it into a game.
1465840	1467840	And when you hear the story, you're going to go,
1467840	1469840	oh, I'm an asshole for...
1469840	1470840	I just wanted to...
1470840	1471840	I'll take it back.
1471840	1472840	All right.
1472840	1477840	So we were in Arlington and we went to this bar
1477840	1479840	and we were sitting there drinking.
1479840	1483840	And there was this guy sitting across the bar that kept looking at us.
1483840	1484840	He was wearing a suit.
1484840	1488840	And Aaron said, I think I recognize that guy from Twitter
1488840	1489840	or something like that.
1489840	1490840	We were theorizing.
1490840	1491840	Is he a fan?
1491840	1492840	He keeps glancing over here.
1492840	1497840	At one point, Aaron got up to go to the bathroom and he came over
1497840	1503840	and he said he handed me three napkins with a letter written on them
1503840	1507840	and said, Mr. Harmon, I can't make the show tonight
1507840	1510840	because it sold out faster than I could get a ticket.
1510840	1513840	And I wrote this letter for you thanking you.
1513840	1516840	I was hoping that if I drove out here,
1516840	1521840	I would be able to catch you at some bar.
1521840	1523840	He had a good chance.
1523840	1526840	And I just wanted to give this to you and thank you
1526840	1528840	on the off chance that it was possible.
1528840	1531840	I can't get into the show.
1531840	1532840	I'm not asking for a ticket.
1532840	1534840	I just wanted to talk to you and thank you.
1534840	1538840	Three years ago, my fiance, my girlfriend,
1538840	1543840	was killed by a drunk driver and I was devastated by it.
1543840	1547840	And then I saw community and it made me really happy
1547840	1550840	and I just wanted to thank you for it.
1550840	1554840	And so that's it.
1554840	1557840	And I said, buddy, read the marquee.
1557840	1559840	It says sold out.
1559840	1562840	Now look at my face, Jeff.
1562840	1563840	Look, I'm crying.
1563840	1564840	See?
1564840	1566840	No, I got into the show.
1566840	1567840	That's the part that makes you cry.
1567840	1570840	That part that makes you cry is someone died.
1570840	1571840	I cried.
1571840	1572840	I cried.
1572840	1573840	We don't have to applaud it.
1573840	1575840	That would be weird.
1575840	1576840	All right.
1576840	1577840	Next thing.
1577840	1582840	Can you get a full erection in front of that guy right there?
1582840	1585840	Three feet from that guy, can you get a full erection
1585840	1587840	without using your hands?
1587840	1589840	Can you produce a full erection in front of this guy?
1589840	1591840	He leaned forward like he's ready to go.
1591840	1594840	A full erection looking at him,
1594840	1597840	just making eye contact with him in an erection.
1597840	1598840	You can say what you want.
1598840	1599840	You can do what you want,
1599840	1601840	but you may not physically arouse yourself with your hands.
1601840	1604840	That hardly seems fair.
1604840	1607840	I didn't say it was going to be easy.
1607840	1609840	What's on your sweatshirt, sir?
1609840	1614840	It says Property of Harmon XXL High School D&D Club.
1614840	1615840	Did you make that sweatshirt?
1615840	1616840	Oh, that's cool.
1616840	1617840	Thank you.
1617840	1618840	That's amazing.
1618840	1619840	What's your name?
1619840	1620840	Aaron.
1620840	1621840	So, Dan?
1621840	1622840	Moses' brother's name.
1622840	1624840	You have 30 seconds on the clock.
1624840	1635840	Get a boner for that guy right now.
1635840	1643840	It moves all the time.
1643840	1645840	So the guy or a girl?
1645840	1647840	Somebody just boned out.
1647840	1650840	With a confidence stride.
1650840	1651840	I hope they're going,
1651840	1652840	well, three minutes I'll go to the bathroom.
1652840	1654840	Or maybe it's like one of those old-timey reporters.
1654840	1656840	He has to get up and get to a pay phone.
1656840	1659840	It's comedy gold.
1659840	1660840	I kind of want to know the story.
1660840	1662840	I want that guy interviewed.
1662840	1663840	He'll be back.
1663840	1664840	Or maybe he won't.
1664840	1665840	Was he with you?
1665840	1667840	That guy who left?
1667840	1669840	So was he probably going to the bathroom?
1669840	1671840	Or was he leaning over to you guys going,
1671840	1673840	this is fucking bullshit.
1673840	1676840	You guys told me Rob Schneider was going to be here.
1676840	1680840	So he's probably going to the bathroom.
1680840	1681840	Okay.
1681840	1683840	What if he came back with a huge boner?
1683840	1685840	And I was like,
1685840	1687840	bam.
1687840	1688840	All right.
1688840	1689840	I don't know.
1689840	1691840	I have to talk to myself, okay?
1691840	1692840	So like, okay.
1692840	1694840	I'm a high school gym coach.
1694840	1709840	I already have a partial.
1709840	1713840	There's a red-headed captain of the volleyball team,
1713840	1715840	girl's volleyball team,
1715840	1722840	needs to speak with me in her office.
1722840	1723840	And in fact,
1723840	1728840	I need to speak to her because she's been very inappropriate
1728840	1734840	with her flirtations with me privately.
1734840	1737840	And for all intents and purposes,
1737840	1738840	she's legal.
1738840	1740840	She's...
1740840	1742840	I'll just say that.
1742840	1748840	But I think you know I mean she's 17.
1748840	1752840	She's a red ponytail.
1752840	1754840	Volleyball.
1754840	1758840	Shorts.
1758840	1759840	Oh wait.
1759840	1760840	I wasn't looking at him.
1760840	1761840	Okay.
1761840	1764840	I'm looking at him.
1764840	1768840	Natalie, your behavior is so inappropriate.
1768840	1775840	What do you mean?
1775840	1776840	There's a decorum.
1776840	1779840	You're not allowed to talk to teachers in a certain way.
1779840	1780840	It can be very distracting
1780840	1782840	and it's not a professional boundary between us.
1782840	1788840	I am a gatekeeper of education.
1788840	1792840	You're a young girl and you need to dress more appropriately
1792840	1795840	when you're not playing volleyball.
1795840	1804840	And she kicks off her tennis shoes while she's listening.
1804840	1809840	She plants one clean athletic sock clad foot
1809840	1815840	in the crotch of my crotch.
1815840	1818840	I can't do it.
1818840	1821840	Wait.
1821840	1822840	I have a couple of questions.
1822840	1823840	You know why? Inappropriate.
1823840	1824840	I have a couple of questions.
1824840	1826840	And I love my girlfriend is why.
1826840	1828840	Wait. So that's how you get a boner?
1828840	1830840	You write stories of...
1830840	1831840	No.
1831840	1833840	At that time I get a boner while I'm staring at a guy named Aaron
1833840	1840840	in a shirt with my name on it in front of 200 people,
1840840	1842840	including young girls.
1842840	1845840	And there are several people over 40 in the audience
1845840	1848840	that I've noticed tonight, which is great.
1848840	1849840	It's about time.
1849840	1854840	I'm sick of being this messiah to hipsters.
1854840	1858840	It's about time a couple of my colleagues and peers showed up.
1858840	1859840	Thank you.
1859840	1865840	It's good to see librarians and self-actualized chefs and stuff here.
1865840	1867840	These skateboarders always showing up.
1867840	1870840	Dude, you're amazing. I'm going to be a writer.
1870840	1872840	You don't know that.
1872840	1874840	You don't know that, Todd.
1874840	1876840	You don't know how hard it is.
1876840	1878840	You lock yourself in a prison cell with God
1878840	1880840	and let him have his way with you.
1880840	1883840	You try to have words that aren't your own move through you
1883840	1886840	and have people festoon you with credit for them.
1886840	1889840	You live with that shame, Todd.
1889840	1892840	And then you go back for more, for the people.
1892840	1894840	You think you could do that, Todd?
1894840	1899840	Or maybe you want to do another ollie.
1899840	1905840	Maybe you want to go home and play Red Dead Redemption.
1905840	1907840	All right, so I want to tell you a joke, Jeff.
1907840	1908840	Okay.
1908840	1912840	And I have to use an Irish accent to do it.
1912840	1920840	So it seems there was this man in a pub,
1920840	1923840	sitting and drinking the night away,
1923840	1927840	and at one point he gets up
1927840	1930840	and he falls flat on his face.
1930840	1935840	Everyone goes, oh, ho, oh, bigosh, gurrah.
1935840	1936840	Are you all right?
1936840	1941840	Can we get you assistance beyond us saying, are you all right?
1941840	1945840	He says, I'll be fine.
1945840	1947840	He gets up.
1947840	1955840	He walks to the door.
1955840	1957840	He opens the door.
1957840	1961840	His legs give out and he just falls down again.
1961840	1963840	Oh, oh, we asked you the first time.
1963840	1965840	How many times is this going to happen?
1965840	1966840	Probably three.
1966840	1970840	I bet three.
1970840	1975840	He says, I'll be fine.
1975840	1976840	He gets up again.
1976840	1979840	I just need to get home.
1979840	1980840	He's walking.
1980840	1981840	Oh, shit.
1981840	1982840	He's crawling, isn't he?
1982840	1985840	He can't walk, can he?
1985840	1987840	Blit.
1987840	1989840	I can pull this through.
1989840	1990840	He gets up.
1990840	1991840	He walks home.
1991840	1992840	He gets to his porch,
1992840	1994840	falls down again flat on his face.
1994840	1997840	His neighbor is cooling a pie in the window,
1997840	2002840	so he sees it, says, are you okay, Seamus?
2002840	2004840	I'll be fine.
2004840	2008840	Rick, Rick, Rick.
2008840	2012840	I just got to get to my bed, goes upstairs, goes to bed,
2012840	2015840	falls asleep, wakes up the next morning.
2015840	2018840	His wife says, you've been out drinking again, haven't you?
2018840	2022840	Well, how do you know that, Natalie?
2023840	2028840	She says, because you are normally in a wheelchair,
2028840	2030840	which you left at the bar,
2030840	2036840	and you're so drunk you were able to walk,
2036840	2041840	which is physically inspiring,
2041840	2046840	but spiritually and psychologically troubling,
2046840	2049840	because you have to get pretty darn drunk
2049840	2053840	to mitigate the effects of a neurological condition.
2053840	2056840	The reason you can't walk is not psychological.
2056840	2059840	It's not a Disney movie.
2059840	2061840	It's not Downton Abbey.
2061840	2062840	This is a real thing.
2062840	2063840	It won't heal.
2063840	2065840	The doctor showed us.
2065840	2070840	You were injured in an NRA explosion.
2070840	2073840	Shrapnel cleaved your spinal cord.
2073840	2074840	It's physical.
2074840	2075840	I can show you the x-ray.
2075840	2076840	She got it out of the drawers.
2076840	2079840	She says, look, there's a disconnection between the brain
2079840	2084840	that makes things happen and the limbs that enact the desires.
2084840	2086840	There's no way for it to get through.
2086840	2092840	You got so drunk, your thoughts leapt across your spine
2092840	2096840	and landed in the right place like a Tron cycle
2096840	2098840	and raced to your drunken feet,
2098840	2101840	and you propelled yourself, though not 100% effectively,
2101840	2104840	but still astonishingly so,
2104840	2105840	until you got home and passed out.
2105840	2107840	Now try to walk again, and he does, and he can't.
2107840	2109840	He's like, I can't even move me legs.
2109840	2111840	I'm crippled.
2111840	2114840	She says, you mean physically challenged?
2114840	2118840	And he says, well, what are you, the word police?
2118840	2124840	She says, well, someone has to be a filthy-mouthed old cow.
2124840	2129840	She made him some tea, and, you know, he apologized,
2129840	2133840	but at this point, it's a cycle.
2133840	2136840	I don't know.
2136840	2142840	That didn't turn out his plan, did it?
2142840	2144840	Oh, did Jason really leave?
2144840	2145840	Is our bus driver here?
2145840	2147840	I believe he's still here.
2147840	2148840	Okay, if he's willing to.
2148840	2150840	Wait, no, he left?
2150840	2151840	He left?
2151840	2152840	That motherfucker.
2152840	2154840	He got nervous about it.
2154840	2155840	Tonight was one of the few nights
2155840	2157840	that we might have been able to bring our bus driver off.
2157840	2159840	We're traveling.
2159840	2162840	Is he really gone?
2162840	2164840	Wait, is he out in the parking lot?
2164840	2165840	No, he's not.
2165840	2166840	He actually got in the car?
2166840	2167840	He actually got in the car?
2167840	2169840	He got in the car with the girl selling it.
2169840	2171840	Wait, what?
2171840	2174840	He absconded with one of your staff?
2174840	2177840	He got in the car with the girl that sells tickets.
2177840	2178840	He really is.
2178840	2180840	Well, there's bad news and there's worse news.
2180840	2184840	The bad news is that our very charismatic
2184840	2189840	and complicated bus driver, Jason, couldn't be here tonight.
2189840	2191840	I really wanted you guys to meet him.
2191840	2195840	The worst news is that he's our driver and he's drunk, right?
2195840	2202840	Well, you know, he'll be fine.
2202840	2206840	He just needs to summon the neurological miracles necessary to...
2206840	2209840	Hey, what was the name of that place we walked by today
2209840	2211840	when it was, like, the funniest last name you ever saw?
2211840	2212840	Stemullis.
2212840	2213840	Stemullis.
2213840	2214840	We're back at our place called Stemullis.
2214840	2215840	What's the place that's called the strip,
2215840	2218840	where all the ethnic markets are?
2218840	2220840	I don't even know what Stemullis sells.
2220840	2224840	Stemullis is the funniest name in the world.
2224840	2226840	Yeah, we walked by.
2226840	2229840	Stemullis, like, made it up.
2229840	2231840	Hey, welcome to Stemullis.
2231840	2236840	Stemullis, if we don't got it, oh!
2236840	2237840	He sounds excited.
2237840	2239840	That's just me.
2239840	2243840	Stemullis, come on.
2243840	2244840	It's hilarious.
2244840	2245840	All right.
2245840	2247840	I also, in the back, the director was interviewing me.
2247840	2250840	He asked me all kinds of weird questions about my brain
2250840	2254840	and how it works and why people keep forgiving me for being a bad person.
2254840	2257840	By the way, last night's show, which I don't think is podcast yet,
2257840	2260840	like, it got weird again.
2260840	2261840	It'll get weird here too.
2261840	2262840	I cried.
2262840	2263840	I've never done that yet.
2263840	2265840	But he asked me a question.
2265840	2268840	He said, do you think there's anything you could tell people
2268840	2270840	that would make them not like you?
2270840	2273840	Like, they seem so forgiving of you.
2273840	2275840	And I'm like, yeah, because I play this honesty shtick
2275840	2279840	where I'm like, hey, high five for telling you.
2279840	2283840	And I don't really have any hatred in my heart or anything like that.
2283840	2286840	Like, last night, he thought it was going to be an exception
2286840	2289840	because we brought Erin McGathey, my beautiful, wonderful,
2289840	2293840	genius girlfriend up, who does nothing but unconditionally support me,
2293840	2296840	unless she's had a couple.
2296840	2299840	At which point, sometimes if I have also had a couple,
2299840	2303840	we get in an good old-fashioned Irish-Polish white trash,
2303840	2306840	which is a verbal sparring match.
2306840	2310840	At which point, I become Kevin Spacey in Seven,
2310840	2314840	Hannibal Lecter, you know, Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master.
2314840	2320840	Like, I do this thing where I don't necessarily say anything worse
2320840	2323840	than you've ever said to your significant other in a fight
2323840	2326840	when you're trying to kind of hurt each other's feelings.
2327840	2331840	But, you know, I shift into this persona
2331840	2336840	that is sociopathically kind of gleeful at the kind of, like,
2336840	2340840	dispassionate disconnection that I feel.
2340840	2342840	Do you know what I mean?
2342840	2347840	I regard her as if she is an insect and explain things to her
2347840	2350840	in a way she can understand.
2350840	2353840	Let me lay it on the line for you.
2353840	2356840	You know, kind of like turning into this villain,
2356840	2359840	because that's when I've passed the threshold
2359840	2362840	of acceptable human behavior with the booze and stuff.
2362840	2365840	She always, always deserves it.
2365840	2368840	No, kidding. I'm kidding.
2368840	2372840	We brought her up and we kind of talked about it a little bit,
2372840	2375840	and she mentioned that I called her the C-word,
2375840	2378840	at which point the audience did that.
2378840	2381840	Absolute requirement. I back you up 100%.
2381840	2383840	You don't trust me?
2383840	2384840	He said, I trust you.
2384840	2386840	Oh, you trust me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2386840	2389840	I mean, it's bad.
2389840	2392840	But, yeah. So, the director was interviewing me,
2392840	2394840	and he's going, and then they lined up,
2394840	2395840	and they wanted your autograph.
2395840	2396840	And he was a little disappointed.
2396840	2397840	He was bummed out.
2397840	2399840	He thought he would see the final turning point.
2399840	2401840	So then he asked the question,
2401840	2402840	that was very interesting,
2402840	2405840	is there anything I could tell you that I haven't told you yet
2405840	2410840	about me that would make you, like, turn on me?
2410840	2413840	I think the answer is no, for the same reason.
2413840	2416840	It's because what we have going for us is, like,
2416840	2419840	we don't want anyone to be unhappy.
2419840	2422840	I mean, that's a story about me getting too drunk,
2422840	2424840	and I have a horrible, like, dysfunctional,
2424840	2427840	neurotic behavior I engage in, in a cyclical way,
2427840	2431840	that I've begged therapists to diffuse,
2431840	2432840	and then they can't do it,
2432840	2434840	and I get mad and I stop going to them.
2434840	2436840	So I try to talk into a microphone
2436840	2438840	and try to attempt to do self-maintenance and things like that.
2438840	2439840	And part of that involves confession.
2439840	2442840	He said, what could you tell them that would make them not like you?
2442840	2445840	I don't think I've ever said into a microphone, into the recording,
2445840	2447840	I think I've blogged about this fact.
2447840	2449840	I use drugs recreationally.
2449840	2451840	I'm a prescription marijuana user.
2451840	2454840	I don't get high when I work.
2454840	2455840	It doesn't, because I can't.
2455840	2457840	If it helped, I'd do it.
2457840	2460840	I've done Adderall illegally,
2460840	2461840	but I'm not ashamed of that,
2461840	2464840	because you're welcome for season two of Community.
2464840	2473840	You don't get eight hours of sleep at night and do some of that stuff.
2473840	2476840	That sounded horribly self-aggrandizing.
2476840	2477840	That's not what I meant.
2477840	2481840	I meant it takes a long time to piss off the network and studio.
2481840	2485840	You have to get up earlier than them and go to bed later than them.
2485840	2488840	I don't think I've ever said precisely,
2488840	2491840	because it's uncharismatic that I've done cocaine.
2492840	2498840	Even since my early 20s, when I discovered it doing improv in Milwaukee,
2498840	2501840	I've experimented with it.
2501840	2503840	Not here in Los Angeles.
2503840	2506840	If I'm at a party and somebody's got some of it,
2506840	2511840	now that I'm 40, it's more of a,
2511840	2514840	I want to stay up and keep drinking so someone's got this stuff
2514840	2515840	and I'm not going to say no to it.
2515840	2519840	I just wanted to say that, because now I'm fucking perfect.
2519840	2522840	There's nothing that I haven't said.
2522840	2524840	I'm done.
2524840	2528840	I can't think of any secrets I have left.
2528840	2531840	I don't recommend that as behavior for you.
2531840	2532840	You can keep secrets.
2532840	2533840	Secrets are healthy.
2533840	2534840	Secrets are fine.
2534840	2536840	The reason I never say this is because it's a grody drug.
2536840	2539840	It's synthetic and it's like Don Johnson-y.
2539840	2542840	It wouldn't make anyone like me anymore,
2542840	2547840	nor is it like it's not like an addict would say this,
2547840	2550840	but there's no addiction because it's been in my life
2550840	2552840	on and off for whenever.
2552840	2556840	It's a party thing that happens sometimes in big Hollywood.
2556840	2559840	It probably happens all over the country.
2559840	2563840	Yeah, dishwashers do it if they can't get a hold of some Adderall,
2563840	2570840	but season two of those plates last night at Stimbouli's.
2570840	2573840	Stimbouli's.
2573840	2575840	So that's it, I don't know.
2576840	2578840	There's no reaction I expect.
2578840	2579840	Now I'm like...
2579840	2582840	You always talk about yourself and kind of self-flagellate yourself
2582840	2584840	about being a terrible person, that you're a bad person.
2584840	2586840	I don't think it's because of behavior.
2586840	2588840	It would be more about the way that you're...
2588840	2593840	When you get upset with somebody, whether you mean to or not,
2593840	2598840	because you're a good writer, the way your mind works,
2598840	2600840	you have the ability to really hurt somebody
2600840	2602840	with kind of the flick of a wrist.
2603840	2608840	And you said backstage something about the idea
2608840	2610840	that you like the tears.
2610840	2612840	When you're in that moment...
2612840	2614840	When I'm way overboard, yeah.
2614840	2617840	With my significant others, there have been moments when...
2617840	2622840	If the significant other is going toe-to-toe with me
2622840	2628840	and it's too much to drink, it gets white, trashy, drunk,
2629840	2632840	where it's like blackout or almost blackout.
2632840	2633840	Yeah, there are...
2633840	2635840	Most of the time, 85% of the time...
2635840	2637840	Did you hear my little Milwaukee accent?
2637840	2641840	Most of the time, Pittsburgh's bringing it out of me.
2641840	2647840	Most of the time, 85% of the time, if I get too drunk
2647840	2651840	and I have a fight with someone I love and they start to cry,
2651840	2654840	that's the end of it because the tears signify like,
2654840	2656840	oh shit, this reality comes in.
2656840	2658840	I was in a different mode.
2658840	2664840	I was a battle bot of some kind and I was trying to win a fight.
2664840	2666840	I don't know what it is.
2666840	2668840	Whatever dysfunction I have, whatever disorder,
2668840	2671840	enables me to pull the plug on the emotional connection
2671840	2673840	between me and another human being.
2673840	2675840	So then there's no conscientiousness,
2675840	2678840	standing between me and saying something
2678840	2682840	with the direct intent of humbling someone.
2682840	2684840	And then if they start to cry, most of the time,
2684840	2686840	then I'm like, oh shit, that's what I'm doing.
2686840	2688840	Holy crap, stop, stop, stop.
2688840	2690840	But then there's like that 15% of the time,
2690840	2694840	if it's really grody drunk and the other person's drunk
2694840	2697840	and there's just fighting, fighting, fighting, back and forth.
2697840	2698840	Only when you're drunk?
2698840	2701840	Yeah, yeah, I don't...
2701840	2705840	Yeah, I'm making sure that's the case in my head.
2705840	2708840	Yeah, it's a thing, it's an alcohol thing.
2708840	2711840	It lowers your inhibitions, it makes you looser,
2711840	2713840	maybe it makes you charming up to a certain point.
2713840	2715840	Then there's, you know, you can go through a curtain
2715840	2717840	where your behavior becomes bad.
2717840	2718840	Jekyll and Hyde.
2718840	2720840	So kids, pay attention to that.
2720840	2722840	Don't look up to drunk writers.
2722840	2725840	It's not what makes you good.
2725840	2728840	Your parents have to beat you.
2728840	2731840	So if that didn't happen, you're going to write shitty stuff.
2731840	2735840	You're probably like just a bad dream journal.
2735840	2738840	You got too much love, I'm sorry.
2739840	2743840	Yeah, then what I was saying to the director was, yeah,
2743840	2746840	there's like the tears I actually go, okay, good.
2746840	2749840	I think in my head like, good.
2749840	2751840	Cry.
2751840	2753840	Delicious tears.
2753840	2755840	Put them on a cupcake.
2755840	2758840	Cry until you can't anymore, then I'll apologize.
2758840	2760840	Would you actually experience like physical like...
2760840	2762840	An erection? No.
2762840	2764840	No, no.
2764840	2767840	Like you actually enjoy it or did you actually feel pleasure from that?
2767840	2769840	No, no, it's all about defensiveness.
2769840	2771840	It's about being threatened.
2771840	2777840	If I'm a child and I feel like my mommy is trying to get away
2777840	2780840	with something coming at me, like I need to win.
2780840	2781840	I need to defeat.
2781840	2784840	I need to defend myself.
2784840	2787840	Not noticing that I'm a 40-year-old man
2787840	2790840	with his full faculties about it.
2790840	2793840	I think the superpower, like we've all, like everyone in this room,
2793840	2796840	there's certain things about us that make us who we are, make us cool.
2796840	2798840	And there's things that draw people to you.
2798840	2802840	And also there's things, the same thing, the flip side of that coin
2802840	2805840	is the same thing that repels people from you.
2805840	2807840	Like people when they meet Dan...
2807840	2810840	Or first of all, like Rob Schwab, our friend, he's an artist.
2810840	2813840	He's a great, he's an awesome, like, you know, he's a visual thinker.
2813840	2816840	When people meet Rob, it's very like there's people that come up to him
2816840	2818840	and like Rob's opinion of them is so important
2818840	2820840	and he can really make or break their night.
2820840	2824840	And what they want from Rob is to find out, am I creative?
2824840	2827840	And if Rob doesn't think you're creative, it hurts them, you know?
2827840	2829840	Who the fuck is this guy?
2829840	2832840	Okay. Welcome back.
2832840	2834840	For Dan...
2834840	2837840	You know that you don't have the right to do what you just did.
2837840	2839840	Hey, Dan, no, no, no.
2839840	2843840	This is my third glass of chattel. I want to talk to this fucker.
2843840	2848840	Do you understand? Let me put things in perspective for you.
2848840	2850840	The thing about you is that...
2850840	2852840	Oh, no, no, that's...
2853840	2855840	Obviously, I was kidding.
2855840	2857840	He said he would have peed his pants.
2857840	2862840	People come up to you and the people that come up to you need something from you.
2862840	2867840	It's important for certain people to think that you think that they are smart.
2867840	2869840	I think smart is the key word. Yeah.
2869840	2873840	So when you diminish somebody's intellectual ability or like intelligence...
2873840	2875840	Which, by the way, I don't...
2875840	2877840	When I get in a fight with Erin, I never call her stupid.
2877840	2879840	She can correct me if she wants to.
2879840	2883840	You talk to her like, let me explain this to you like a baby.
2883840	2885840	I'm implying that she doesn't...
2885840	2886840	Like a chimpanzee.
2886840	2892840	I'm implying that she doesn't have perspective on how devastating I can be as a robot.
2892840	2897840	Don't you understand the faculties of this operational death star?
2897840	2901840	You don't know how powerful I am. It's more like that.
2901840	2903840	You're just Emperor Palpatine.
2903840	2905840	It's not your stupid.
2905840	2907840	I pat myself on the back for that.
2908840	2910840	Well, whatever. Let's get off of that.
2910840	2913840	It's getting narcissistic. That lady's leaving.
2913840	2915840	Just go and pee, right?
2915840	2917840	Okay.
2917840	2919840	Let's unfollow her.
2919840	2921840	I think it's number two.
2923840	2927840	She's got to take a big old shit in the bathroom.
2927840	2929840	Lady in the head and the jeans.
2929840	2932840	She's got to take a diamond of a turd.
2932840	2935840	Since we've taken the show to that place,
2935840	2939840	I just wanted to say how satisfying it was to fart in Pittsburgh today.
2939840	2942840	The coldness, like that brisk coldness.
2942840	2944840	Okay, now that guy's leaving. Okay.
2944840	2947840	Look, I mean, there's intellectuals in the audience. I can sense it.
2947840	2952840	I'm sorry, but I did coke now and then and Adderall,
2952840	2954840	and today I farted in Pittsburgh out on the sidewalk.
2954840	2960840	And I had this extreme pleasure imagining this 98.6 degree thing,
2960840	2965840	like getting out of the outer rim of its comfort zone.
2965840	2967840	You mean your anus.
2967840	2969840	Anus is the word you're looking for.
2969840	2970840	What's that?
2970840	2971840	Anus is the word you're looking for.
2971840	2973840	No, I'm not looking for it.
2975840	2977840	Last night you were.
2977840	2980840	Okay, there's one more secret I have left.
2980840	2981840	I was looking for anus last night.
2981840	2985840	Season three of Community was written largely on anus.
2985840	2989840	I just imagine this little puff of this thing coming out
2989840	2994840	and going, whoa, just like being just like dispersing,
2994840	2995840	like at the speed of light.
2995840	2996840	Like I'm sure that's not how it works,
2996840	2999840	but from my understanding of thermodynamics,
2999840	3000840	like hot things want to go to cold things.
3000840	3004840	And like, I just like, I just like, I was talking to a bunch of people
3004840	3005840	or people walking over and I was like,
3005840	3007840	I bet you could fart here and just like no one,
3007840	3009840	no one even smell it because it's just like the fart.
3009840	3013840	It's probably just goes just like it's halfway across town and on both sides.
3013840	3016840	It's like, you know, just like become emerges with the cosmos.
3016840	3020840	All right. Anyways, I just wanted to get that off my chest, so to speak.
3020840	3022840	Dan, I would say right now, whatever you're about to say,
3022840	3025840	just because it's better to have him up earlier than later, because it always is.
3025840	3027840	Can we bring Spencer to the stage?
3027840	3028840	Spencer up.
3029840	3030840	Spencer. Okay.
3030840	3032840	Dungeon Master extraordinaire.
3034840	3036840	Storyteller and extremist.
3037840	3041840	You, you haven't heard the, you haven't heard the show from last night.
3041840	3043840	One of the most amazing things about it.
3043840	3047840	Yeah. Out in front of the, uh, of the pirates, uh, baseball stadium,
3047840	3048840	whatever that's called.
3049840	3052840	PNC park. We already discussed this. There's a, there's a, there's a,
3052840	3054840	there's a giant statue of Hannes Wagner, like, like, like,
3054840	3059840	after having, you know, like hit a tater and, uh, it's Hannes.
3059840	3060840	Look it up.
3061840	3065840	Uh, great, great groups. My friend insists that it's Hannes and not Honus.
3065840	3067840	And I defer to Greg on this.
3067840	3071840	I've always called him Honus Wagner, but he says Hannes and he's, uh, he's like,
3071840	3072840	he will not be moved.
3072840	3073840	Greg's pretty particular.
3073840	3074840	He is.
3074840	3075840	Very airy day.
3075840	3076840	Anyway.
3076840	3078840	I'm a pseudo-intellectual. Greg is an intellectual.
3078840	3079840	H. Wagner.
3080840	3083840	Uh, he's a, he's a, he's a famed, uh, a ball player.
3083840	3087840	Last night, Spencer, if he could be compared to baseball terms,
3087840	3093840	hit, uh, 900 last night on, on, we, we kept throwing things at him to just,
3093840	3097840	we would make up new monsters and he would just describe new monsters.
3097840	3100840	Yeah. We landed on this game where we just make up like, uh,
3100840	3105840	monster names and throw them at, at Spencer and he describes them, uh, uh,
3105840	3107840	as he would in a game.
3107840	3110840	And it's not fair to do that again tonight because last night he was so, like,
3110840	3113840	he hit like five home runs and one triple off the wall, basically.
3113840	3114840	Yeah. It was pretty fun.
3114840	3117840	He got on base a lot and then, and, uh, it was, it was good stuff.
3117840	3121840	I wouldn't want to do it to you again, Spencer, because I hate to, you know.
3121840	3123840	Also, I can't think, I can't remember which ones we threw at him.
3123840	3126840	So like we were doing like, Spencer, alcoholism.
3127840	3128840	Do you want me? Yeah.
3129840	3132840	Well, I got, did we do that one? No, I don't think so.
3132840	3134840	Spencer, alcoholism is attacking me.
3134840	3139840	Opening the door to the bathroom. You felt, you smell the reek of whiskey.
3139840	3144840	You hear the splash of liquid into the bathroom and then you feel a figure rising.
3144840	3149840	Opening the door to the stall. You see a hobo drenched in vomit and liquor.
3150840	3151840	Yeah.
3155840	3157840	A double. That's a double.
3157840	3159840	Yeah. No, that's definitely. Yeah. That's a double. Yeah.
3160840	3163840	He's freaking freestyle dungeon master. I mean, dungeon mastering is freestyling.
3163840	3169840	Yeah. What's that? What'd you say? Oh, no, I saw, I thought I saw your mouth moving.
3171840	3174840	Oh, wait, what have you got? That's Mike and Jen.
3175840	3177840	Well, Jen and Mike. Yeah.
3177840	3181840	Jen and Mike come to the stage. We were warned about you in advance.
3181840	3184840	Okay. Now I just, I think I realized why Aaron came backstage and said,
3184840	3186840	you should probably bring Jen and Mike up tonight.
3186840	3188840	All right. I think we're getting an indication.
3188840	3191840	Hello, Mike. Mike has a yellow shirt on. It says Harman Town. Harman.
3191840	3194840	Harman Town. Harman Town.
3194840	3197840	Oh, Harman Town. Are you a yinzer? Is that what that is?
3197840	3199840	Yeah. Yeah. Are you from here?
3199840	3201840	From Westmoreland County originally.
3201840	3204840	So Harman, how would you say that in your phonetics?
3204840	3210840	Harman Town. Harman Town. Anybody else? Come on. Nobody.
3210840	3211840	All right. Go to Pittsburgh.
3211840	3214840	And Jen, let's see. Let's get a look at you. Yours says?
3215840	3218840	Harman Town the same. But you have to have the black and yellow Pittsburgh
3218840	3222840	colors and you have a little like foam number one thingies.
3222840	3224840	Yeah. This is Dan's Ray of Frost.
3224840	3226840	You're not giving this to me, are you?
3226840	3228840	No. No, really?
3228840	3232840	Oh, no. This is my flaming sword?
3232840	3235840	Oh, fucking rad.
3235840	3240840	They made authentic foam, an authentic foam number one kind of sports
3240840	3244840	fan hand, like the number one thing, and it's blue, like icy blue,
3244840	3249840	and has a screaming frosty skull and sparkles coming out of the index finger.
3249840	3252840	And on the back of it, it says Ray of Frost.
3252840	3256840	And I have a flaming sword that is just, I mean, it's really just a sword
3256840	3258840	that's on fire. It's fucking amazing.
3258840	3262840	I feel like Guy Thierry's shirt just came in here.
3262840	3266840	This is amazing. That is good.
3266840	3269840	Did you hear the Brooklyn show by any chance?
3269840	3271840	Oh, with Sudeikis? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3271840	3274840	We found out at Brooklyn that, I don't know if you were halfway done making this
3274840	3278840	or not, that Ray of Frost is a level zero spell that does a maximum of three
3278840	3283840	damage after, and we found that out after singing the Ray of Frost theme song
3283840	3287840	and really celebrating that I was casting it like I was a professional wrestler.
3287840	3291840	We then found out Ray of Frost does from zero to three damage.
3291840	3295840	Am I right or wrong in saying the little frosty stars on the Ray of Frost,
3295840	3297840	are those the Pittsburgh logo?
3298840	3300840	Oh, yeah, conveniently enough.
3300840	3303840	Put it on like hypercycloids.
3303840	3307840	Hypocycloids, yeah. That's a shape, a little diamondy,
3307840	3310840	little sparkle nuggets on the...
3310840	3312840	Are you guys an item, Mike and Jen?
3312840	3314840	Yes, we are.
3314840	3319840	Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.
3319840	3322840	Dan, get a boner. Dan, get a boner.
3322840	3324840	Dan, get a boner.
3325840	3327840	Married or just dating?
3327840	3329840	No, just living together.
3329840	3330840	How long?
3330840	3332840	Living in sin.
3332840	3333840	For how long?
3333840	3335840	Around a year and a half.
3335840	3337840	And how long were you going out before you moved in?
3337840	3339840	Oh, okay.
3339840	3341840	Are you guys in love?
3341840	3343840	Yeah.
3343840	3345840	You are.
3345840	3347840	They have a thing to unite them.
3347840	3349840	Mike, I know the answer to this is no.
3349840	3352840	Do you ever get really drunk and become incredibly weirdly,
3353840	3356840	sociopathically abusive to Jen?
3356840	3358840	I think it's probably true.
3358840	3361840	Yeah, unfortunately, she did lean over and say,
3361840	3364840	that's you whenever you were describing yourself.
3364840	3368840	Oh, all right. See, once again, I'm bulletproof.
3368840	3370840	No, no, ladies, I'm not.
3370840	3374840	I know that there's something wrong with me that I want to change.
3374840	3377840	It's not good behavior. It's not part of my creative process.
3377840	3378840	It's not good.
3378840	3380840	Jen, would you have any advice to give Dan?
3381840	3384840	Not that you would presume to give anybody advice,
3384840	3386840	because you guys are clearly very happy together.
3386840	3389840	You've been together longer than Dan and Erin have been together, basically.
3389840	3392840	I have no advice. I have my own psychoses and neuroses.
3392840	3394840	What's your hang up? What's your bag?
3394840	3396840	I don't even know.
3396840	3398840	Mike, what's wrong with Jen?
3398840	3399840	Mike!
3399840	3401840	Yeah, ask the source, man.
3401840	3404840	Jen, stop listening for a second.
3407840	3409840	We won't tell her.
3410840	3415840	No, I think the problem is Jen and I are pretty much the same age,
3415840	3420840	but she has developed a wealth of knowledge beyond my own.
3420840	3423840	And so there's insecurities of not being able to compete with that
3423840	3427840	and feel like I'm getting my side of the argument across.
3427840	3430840	I'm not sure if I'm just being stupid or not.
3430840	3432840	Does that manifest itself in you going,
3432840	3437840	just because you're smart doesn't mean you can become Stanley Kowalski?
3438840	3440840	I mean, that happens to me with Erin, too.
3440840	3443840	I get intimidated by how smart she is,
3443840	3446840	and then I try to deflect and trick her into thinking that.
3446840	3448840	That's not what we're talking about.
3448840	3450840	That's not even the point.
3450840	3452840	Yeah, it is. I'm stupid.
3454840	3456840	Well, that makes me feel a little better,
3456840	3458840	because if you can't infer those in podcast land,
3458840	3465840	Mike is an adorable, lithe, bespectacled, knit-capped,
3465840	3467840	adorned, bearded...
3467840	3470840	He's kind of like what Zach Galifianakis thinks he is.
3472840	3474840	He's the sexy Zach Galifianakis.
3474840	3480840	Yeah, Zach Galifianakis is an avatar in heaven when we wake up in heaven
3480840	3483840	and you just look how you...
3483840	3485840	All right, well, thank you, Jen and Mike.
3485840	3487840	I guess unless there's anything, while you have the conch,
3487840	3489840	do you want to...
3490840	3492840	I think I'm good. Oh, no.
3492840	3494840	No, I would like to be able to make Pittsburgh proud,
3494840	3496840	but that's not going to happen tonight.
3496840	3498840	Where should we go drinking if we go drinking in Pittsburgh?
3498840	3500840	I was saying Gooskies. Anyone else?
3500840	3501840	Gooskies?
3501840	3502840	Gooskies.
3502840	3503840	Where's that at?
3503840	3505840	Oh, it's out on Polish Hill.
3505840	3507840	Polish Hill? Dan, you're Polish.
3507840	3508840	Yeah, I sure am.
3508840	3510840	Is that near Stemullis?
3511840	3513840	I mean, look, you don't have to.
3513840	3514840	I can play you off with this beat,
3514840	3517840	but if you guys want to rap with Dan as a...
3517840	3518840	Give it a whirl.
3518840	3520840	We can edit it out of the podcast if we want.
3522840	3524840	I'm sorry, I didn't know you didn't know,
3524840	3525840	I just didn't talk.
3525840	3526840	Yo.
3526840	3527840	Yo.
3527840	3528840	Yo.
3528840	3530840	Mike and Jen take the stage with me.
3530840	3533840	Boop is brown, yellow is front beat.
3533840	3534840	Rapping like Yoda.
3534840	3537840	Lower in the bar, raising the quota.
3537840	3539840	I'd like to rap with Jen and Mike,
3539840	3542840	and right now Mike's going to get on the mic.
3542840	3544840	No, you're going too fast for me.
3544840	3546840	Like I said, I'm not smart enough to argue with her.
3546840	3548840	I can't rap at all.
3548840	3549840	All right, here, wait, wait, okay.
3549840	3551840	Right here, here we go.
3551840	3555840	Once upon a time, I needed to eat a loaf of bread.
3555840	3560840	I didn't get it soon enough, so I starved, now I'm dead.
3560840	3565840	I put on a pair of shoes and walked down the street.
3565840	3569840	I didn't get my bread, but saw your mama and got my meat.
3569840	3571840	Slower, this is like slower tempo.
3571840	3573840	You can do it like that.
3573840	3576840	Take a mic.
3576840	3577840	Oh, yeah.
3577840	3582840	I don't think I can as hard as I try to think.
3582840	3583840	And that's it.
3583840	3585840	I hit a wall immediately back up.
3585840	3586840	All right, Jen.
3586840	3587840	Jen, you're smart.
3587840	3588840	Jen, you're smart.
3588840	3589840	Shame him, Jen.
3589840	3594840	Shame him like the Caribbean he is.
3594840	3595840	All right, well.
3595840	3596840	All right, she's dancing.
3596840	3597840	She's dancing.
3597840	3599840	All right, she's dancing.
3599840	3600840	Jen's got the booze.
3600840	3601840	Jen's got the booze.
3601840	3602840	Jen's got the booze.
3602840	3603840	Grooves did the grooves.
3603840	3604840	Jen's got the booze.
3604840	3606840	Jen's got the booze.
3606840	3608840	Let's hear it for Jen and Mike, everybody.
3608840	3611840	How you doing?
3611840	3613840	You sure you're giving these up, right?
3613840	3614840	These are ours?
3614840	3615840	Thank you.
3615840	3619840	That's really incredible.
3619840	3620840	These are wonderful.
3620840	3621840	Look at that fucking thing.
3621840	3623840	We should have them sign them after the show.
3623840	3626840	Speaking of Rob Shropp, this isn't very Shroppy and stuff.
3626840	3627840	He'd be very proud of that.
3627840	3630840	You can still see the hot glue strings on it, which makes it nice.
3630840	3631840	I love that.
3631840	3639840	Yeah, they did a great job of simulating a kind of a sword with embers on it
3639840	3641840	and flames trailing.
3641840	3650840	Spencer, mediocre zookeeper attacks.
3650840	3651840	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
3651840	3652840	I gotta get the music.
3652840	3653840	I gotta get the music.
3653840	3654840	Oh.
3654840	3657840	The cage opens up with a creak.
3657840	3662840	You see two legs holding a pile of what seems to be bags of feet.
3662840	3666840	Several spill to the floor with a clumsy clatter.
3666840	3671840	Dropping to his knees, a short, portly man stands or crouches before you,
3671840	3675840	apologizing profusely.
3675840	3676840	Zookeeper.
3676840	3679840	Mediocre zookeeper.
3679840	3684840	Just work a day.
3684840	3686840	Yeah, he's got a solitary complex.
3686840	3688840	He's got a zoo to keep, man.
3688840	3689840	But he's not great at it.
3689840	3690840	He doesn't work in San Diego.
3690840	3693840	He's in LA County.
3693840	3695840	I just keep the pelicans alive.
3695840	3696840	That's all I do.
3696840	3698840	I lost three last week.
3698840	3701840	I like that the feces fell to the ground with a clatter.
3701840	3704840	Sometimes they clatter.
3704840	3708840	What sort of animal has pooped that clatter, Spencer?
3708840	3709840	Bags of feet.
3709840	3711840	Bags of feet, he said.
3711840	3714840	But to answer your question, penguins, clearly.
3715840	3716840	All right.
3716840	3720840	Dan, Spencer came to me earlier today.
3720840	3726840	And kind of out of fashion for Spencer, he approached me with a bit for tonight's show.
3726840	3727840	Really?
3727840	3728840	Has he talked to you about this?
3728840	3729840	No.
3729840	3732840	Dan and I have been making up stupid songs on the bus.
3732840	3733840	There's Pringles Dick.
3733840	3735840	There's Chicken Noodle Dick.
3735840	3738840	Has anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?
3738840	3740840	I got drunk last night in Arlington.
3740840	3741840	I sang it twice.
3741840	3743840	I forgot the audience had already heard it.
3744840	3747840	Yeah, we did like an encore and Jeff taught them the Chicken Noodle song
3747840	3749840	and the encore that we had already sung.
3749840	3750840	Has anybody heard the Chicken Noodle Dick song?
3750840	3751840	Here's how it goes.
3751840	3753840	I took that silence for no, we haven't heard it.
3753840	3756840	The silence was, you're drunk.
3756840	3759840	He sang this 45 minutes ago.
3759840	3761840	So Chicken Noodle Dick is Dan on the bus.
3761840	3762840	I'll explain it to you people.
3762840	3768840	Dan on the bus holding a chicken noodle, a can of progressive light chicken noodle soup
3768840	3770840	in his lap as though it were his dick.
3770840	3772840	And we cobbled together this song.
3772840	3774840	Here I am.
3774840	3775840	Ain't got a dick.
3775840	3777840	I got a chicken noodle can.
3777840	3779840	All my life.
3779840	3782840	I've been putting this can inside my chicken noodle wife.
3782840	3784840	Chicken noodle guy come down from the mountains
3784840	3787840	saying chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
3787840	3789840	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river Jordan.
3789840	3791840	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
3791840	3793840	All right, so that's the song.
3793840	3796840	Now, soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon.
3796840	3798840	Spoon to the mouth you're gonna get?
3798840	3800840	Well, soon.
3800840	3801840	I'm trying to build.
3801840	3803840	Yeah, see, I got a building off of that.
3803840	3806840	So Spencer, Spencer's worked on some lyrics to add to it.
3806840	3809840	So it'd be like a verse and then it'd go back to the chorus,
3809840	3811840	which is, you know, the chicken noodle man.
3811840	3814840	And then it's another verse and then back to the chorus.
3814840	3817840	I had this flash of inspiration in the shower or maybe a curse.
3817840	3819840	I mean, we'll see how it goes.
3819840	3823840	Can you explain to me how flashes of lyrics come to you in the shower?
3827840	3830840	Cascading over you in a warm flurry, the water rains down.
3831840	3832840	Then it hits you.
3832840	3834840	A good idea, maybe.
3841840	3842840	He's fucking the best.
3842840	3843840	He's the best.
3845840	3847840	Spencer, I fucking love you so much.
3848840	3851840	But so yeah, if I could do the verse and then we could come back together
3851840	3853840	for the chorus maybe and then try it.
3853840	3854840	I mean, we'll see how it goes.
3854840	3855840	Okay.
3855840	3857840	Okay, so it starts with the soup to the bowl, right?
3857840	3859840	So do you want me to sing that?
3859840	3860840	Yeah, let's do that.
3860840	3861840	All right.
3861840	3864840	Soup to the bowl, bowl to the spoon.
3864840	3866840	Spoon to the mouth, you're gonna get well soon.
3866840	3869840	You better get a little bed rest, sleep until noon.
3869840	3871840	Grab a cup of coffee, then hit the saloon,
3871840	3874840	singing chicken noodle man coming down from the mountain.
3874840	3877840	Chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
3877840	3879840	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
3879840	3882840	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
3882840	3883840	Oh yeah.
3883840	3885840	Blue South and come what may, my chicken noodle wife,
3885840	3887840	left me just the other day.
3887840	3889840	I don't know what I can do but praying,
3889840	3892840	singing chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
3892840	3894840	Chicken noodle man, come down from the mountain,
3894840	3897840	singing chicken noodle man, you gotta work all day.
3897840	3899840	Chicken noodle man, you gotta cross the river, Jordan.
3899840	3902840	Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away.
3902840	3904840	Yeah, that's nice.
3904840	3906840	All right.
3906840	3908840	Write those down.
3908840	3910840	I think, Spencer, when we get on the bus tonight,
3910840	3912840	when we get on the bus, I want lyrics.
3912840	3914840	Pull it up on your iPad.
3914840	3915840	We're gonna learn those tonight.
3915840	3916840	Yeah, let's workshop it.
3916840	3917840	I'm podcast listeners.
3917840	3921840	In the closest we'll ever come to the Tom Jones effect,
3921840	3926840	a man just threw his hipster beanie hat
3926840	3932840	on the stage at Spencer's feet.
3932840	3937840	You have this, take it.
3937840	3940840	Nice.
3940840	3944840	And inside that beanie, there's panties.
3944840	3946840	If it was the 80s, that would be a pocket protector
3946840	3948840	or something, right?
3948840	3950840	Spencer, you're going above and beyond
3950840	3952840	the call of Dungeon Master Duties.
3952840	3954840	And of Road Companion, too.
3954840	3957840	You could have been cranky and become a drag by now,
3957840	3960840	but he's become an inspiration and a good friend.
3960840	3963840	I just want to help.
3963840	3965840	Spencer, we went to Permanente Brothers today.
3965840	3967840	We walked around a bit.
3967840	3969840	What do you feel about Pittsburgh so far?
3969840	3970840	Have you been here before?
3970840	3972840	I've never been here before.
3972840	3973840	I love your guys' architecture.
3973840	3975840	I love your weather.
3975840	3976840	I love it.
3976840	3978840	It's brisk.
3978840	3981840	It's good walking around weather.
3981840	3982840	I won't sweat.
3982840	3984840	I think you noticed I disagreed.
3984840	3986840	Yeah, no, definitely disagreed with you.
3986840	3987840	Where did you grow up?
3987840	3989840	I grew up in Alaska.
3989840	3990840	Oh.
3990840	3992840	No, no.
3992840	3995840	No, I grew up in Northern California.
3995840	3997840	So it's just fun for you, huh?
3997840	3998840	Yeah, I don't know.
3998840	3999840	So weird.
3999840	4001840	It really is the mythology that I'm from Milwaukee,
4001840	4003840	so I'm going to be walking around with my shirt off out there.
4003840	4005840	I said, there's a reason I moved to California.
4005840	4008840	I am a pussy.
4008840	4011840	Do not.
4011840	4012840	It's a great city and stuff.
4012840	4015840	I'm just saying that weather, man.
4015840	4016840	I don't know how you guys do it.
4016840	4017840	I applaud you.
4017840	4019840	It's not even that cold yet.
4019840	4020840	No, no.
4020840	4022840	In February, it'll get colder, right?
4022840	4024840	It'll get 80 below, probably.
4024840	4027840	Well, 80 below with wind chill is the Milwaukee thing.
4027840	4029840	It gets to be 80 below with wind chill.
4029840	4032840	And the weathermen tell you, as part of their weather report,
4032840	4037840	how many seconds in which human skin freezes.
4037840	4038840	It's a regular part.
4038840	4041840	It's like they're telling you the dew point.
4041840	4044840	Don't forget, human skin freezes 28 seconds of this weather,
4044840	4046840	so bundle up.
4046840	4047840	Buckle up your skin?
4047840	4048840	Bundle up.
4048840	4049840	Oh, bundle up.
4049840	4050840	OK.
4050840	4054840	So buckle up.
4054840	4056840	Is anybody here?
4056840	4059840	It's been probably seven years since I've been here.
4059840	4064840	And I found out what a yinzer was.
4064840	4066840	I asked this girl at a bar, I was like,
4066840	4068840	is there a real straight-up yinzer bar?
4068840	4070840	She's like, you don't really want to go to one.
4070840	4071840	I was like, no, I do.
4071840	4072840	I do.
4072840	4073840	And I went there.
4073840	4075840	And people really do say yins when I go down to eat in Pakistan,
4075840	4076840	make zanat, and the fuck it.
4076840	4078840	Like, people say anat, and they say yins.
4078840	4080840	Does anybody here have a really good proper yinzer accent?
4080840	4082840	Or can somebody do one?
4082840	4083840	Huh?
4083840	4084840	Oh, we already had mic up here.
4084840	4085840	Mic's pretty good.
4085840	4086840	You in the back, sir.
4086840	4087840	Come on up.
4087840	4088840	Let's bring that guy in.
4088840	4089840	All right.
4089840	4090840	I want to hear a good and proper yinzer.
4090840	4094840	Good and proper yinzer.
4094840	4098840	Tried to catch the moon, but only caught it.
4098840	4104840	Next thing you know, yinzer accents being done.
4104840	4105840	My name's Ian.
4105840	4106840	Hello, Ian.
4106840	4109840	Ian, I take it you're from here, right?
4109840	4110840	Yeah, basically.
4110840	4111840	Johnstown.
4111840	4112840	So like two hours away.
4112840	4113840	Yeah.
4113840	4114840	All right.
4114840	4116840	So are you going to put on an accent for us?
4116840	4117840	Oh, yeah.
4117840	4119840	I don't talk like a yinzer normally.
4119840	4122840	But so, hey, Ian, the guys won't go downtown.
4122840	4124840	Promani Brothers, get over there.
4124840	4126840	Get some hot sausage sandwich.
4126840	4128840	Hot sausage sandwich?
4128840	4130840	I ain't been worshiping, no clothes.
4130840	4131840	I ain't been worshiping.
4131840	4132840	You say I've been worshiping.
4132840	4133840	The girls say I've been worshiping.
4133840	4134840	I ain't been worshiping nothing.
4134840	4135840	Wait, wait.
4135840	4136840	What on earth?
4136840	4138840	Say what you just said to me.
4138840	4140840	In human English.
4140840	4143840	In English, I haven't been washing.
4143840	4145840	I haven't been washing anything.
4145840	4146840	I ain't been worshiping.
4146840	4148840	I ain't been worshiping nothing.
4148840	4151840	This is my upstairs neighbor in college.
4151840	4153840	So do it again for me?
4153840	4154840	I ain't been worshiping.
4154840	4156840	The girl, she say I've been worshiping.
4156840	4158840	I ain't been worshiping nothing.
4158840	4159840	Awesome.
4159840	4161840	All right, yinzer accent.
4161840	4163840	What does that come from?
4163840	4166840	Is that like a hangover from Scottish Irish?
4166840	4167840	Like what is it from?
4167840	4169840	I have no idea.
4169840	4170840	Polish?
4170840	4171840	Yins?
4171840	4172840	It's Scottish Irish.
4172840	4173840	It's really good.
4173840	4176840	Get up here.
4176840	4179840	Yins are challenged.
4179840	4180840	Uh-oh.
4180840	4181840	Yins are challenged.
4181840	4182840	Yins are a battle.
4182840	4184840	This guy might be a native.
4184840	4185840	He might be better than me.
4185840	4188840	Yeah, let's hear your yinzer.
4188840	4189840	Hi, my name's Dean.
4189840	4191840	I grew up in Trenham, Pennsylvania.
4191840	4195840	It's right up 28.
4196840	4201840	And, like, I can't even tell I have an accent.
4203840	4208840	Essentially, on a normal day, on Sunday, I watch the stillers.
4208840	4210840	I go down to Permanis.
4210840	4212840	I don't go to Promontes or whatever.
4212840	4214840	I don't fucking know.
4214840	4215840	Permanis.
4215840	4216840	Yeah, how about this?
4216840	4217840	I'm a vegetarian.
4217840	4219840	I was out of fucking place in there, man.
4219840	4220840	Still liked it, though.
4220840	4222840	I had a tie-on, and I ate the double egg and cheese,
4222840	4223840	and it was fucking delicious.
4223840	4224840	That's right.
4224840	4227840	Well, usually in Pittsburgh, you get the...
4227840	4229840	Uh, what the fuck is it called?
4229840	4230840	The, uh...
4230840	4231840	The Steak and Cheese.
4231840	4234840	But a Steak and Cheese isn't like a Philadelphia Steak and Cheese.
4234840	4235840	Right.
4235840	4236840	It's got...
4236840	4237840	Capicorn.
4237840	4238840	Well, it doesn't got capicorn.
4238840	4240840	It's Steak and Cheese.
4241840	4243840	It's got sauerkraut.
4243840	4244840	It's got fries.
4244840	4246840	It's got Italian bread.
4246840	4247840	It's good.
4247840	4248840	Yeah, it's amazing.
4248840	4249840	I had that today.
4249840	4253840	Now, do you, in your day-to-day life, say, an act?
4253840	4254840	Yeah, every day.
4254840	4257840	That means, et cetera, and so forth, and then whatnots, right?
4257840	4258840	Right.
4258840	4261840	So, if I'm talking to my buddies, and I want to go down to Goose Keys,
4261840	4264840	and I want to do something before Goose Keys,
4264840	4267840	well, you say you want to go to do Goose Keys and At,
4267840	4268840	or you want to do...
4268840	4269840	What are you going to do?
4269840	4270840	You want to go Eat and At, and then go to Goose Keys?
4270840	4271840	Right.
4271840	4272840	It's like, it's stuff.
4272840	4273840	Or Geat Yet, and go to Goose Keys?
4273840	4274840	Yeah, I love that.
4274840	4275840	That's fantastic.
4275840	4279840	Okay, so, I'd like to think, and I'm almost certain that this is the case...
4279840	4281840	Your name again was what?
4281840	4282840	My name's Dean.
4282840	4284840	Dean, Dan, give...
4284840	4285840	What's your name over there?
4285840	4286840	I'm sorry?
4286840	4287840	Ian.
4287840	4288840	Ian.
4288840	4290840	Dean and Ian are the first yinzer rap battle.
4290840	4291840	Hello.
4299840	4300840	And I want...
4300840	4303840	See, who can be the most yinzer-y during the rap?
4307840	4309840	I went downtown yesterday.
4309840	4310840	I got a pop.
4310840	4311840	Randy's in.
4311840	4312840	Shit.
4315840	4316840	Perfect.
4317840	4318840	Ian, you're a battle.
4321840	4324840	Her many brothers is here for yinsers.
4324840	4325840	Oh, no.
4326840	4328840	Go, go over there.
4328840	4330840	Ian's, Ian's guys watching them, Pittsburgh stillers.
4332840	4333840	Oh, no.
4333840	4334840	I'm from Pittsburgh.
4334840	4335840	I ain't got no rhythm.
4337840	4338840	I can't force nothing.
4338840	4341840	Dan, join in and try to be a yinzer in rap with them.
4341840	4343840	You try to mimic the accent.
4343840	4345840	Yo, yo, yo.
4345840	4348840	Winter watches stillers at the bowl.
4348840	4351840	Fucked your mama in and said, what the fuck, yo?
4352840	4353840	From Pittsburgh.
4354840	4355840	They're all equally terrible.
4355840	4357840	Let's hear it for the yinzer rap, everybody.
4359840	4360840	Have a good night, Nat.
4360840	4361840	Fantastic.
4361840	4362840	Thank you, sir.
4362840	4365840	Ian, for me, it's too similar to the Milwaukee thing.
4366840	4369840	It's very, we're cousins, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee.
4369840	4370840	I don't know.
4370840	4371840	That one's pretty specific.
4371840	4377840	Milwaukee's all about the long vowel sounds, talking through your nose and ending everything
4377840	4380840	with yah and hey and aina, aina.
4380840	4381840	Aina?
4381840	4383840	Yeah, aina hey.
4383840	4384840	Sometimes, I mean, that's extreme shit.
4384840	4386840	That's like, cut a hey, south Milwaukee.
4387840	4392840	But all these accents, they have a little fascinating little trees, little branches
4392840	4393840	of an accent tree.
4393840	4394840	It's pretty cool.
4394840	4396840	Should we start Dungeons and Dragons?
4397840	4399840	Well, one more thing.
4399840	4402840	I wanted to, oh, come on, take it easy, Jen.
4402840	4406840	You know, I've been drinking and I will make Mike look like Mr. Rogers.
4411840	4412840	He's from Pittsburgh.
4412840	4413840	What's that?
4413840	4414840	Mr. Rogers.
4414840	4415840	Oh, is he from Pittsburgh?
4415840	4416840	Is Mr. Rogers from Pittsburgh?
4416840	4420840	Oh, that's why, that's why he was on the wall at...
4420840	4421840	Fucking everybody's on that wall.
4422840	4423840	Gene Kelly's up there?
4424840	4425840	Was he from Pittsburgh?
4425840	4426840	Yeah.
4426840	4431840	Oh, I was wondering whether a random celebrity is interspersed with Terry Bradshaw and stuff.
4431840	4433840	It's the sports guys I get, but...
4433840	4434840	It's everybody.
4434840	4435840	Everybody's up there.
4435840	4436840	Wow, Pittsburgh.
4436840	4437840	Say what?
4437840	4438840	We're an actual city.
4438840	4439840	Nobody said you weren't.
4439840	4440840	He said, we're an actual city.
4440840	4443840	That was a little defensive, sir.
4443840	4447840	I think the last thing anyone would say is that Pittsburgh's not a city.
4447840	4451840	You literally build fucking buildings out of the stuff that you do here.
4451840	4453840	It's of course Pittsburgh's a city.
4453840	4455840	It's steel.
4455840	4460840	It's a fortress full of whipping winds and coleslaw.
4462840	4467840	I like that the coleslaw's not that sweet KFC shit, but it's like that vinegary kind
4467840	4468840	of tart stuff.
4468840	4470840	Yeah, that's how it should be, right?
4470840	4473840	I just wanted to say when we were walking through those whipping winds, this conversation
4473840	4475840	happened between Aaron and Spencer.
4475840	4478840	Aaron said, well, my face is getting used to the cold.
4478840	4482840	And Spencer went, you mean numb?
4487840	4490840	He slices through artifice.
4491840	4493840	He seems to be either villains or monsters.
4493840	4495840	There's magic or there's curses.
4495840	4496840	Is there one more thing?
4496840	4501840	Jeff, do your eyes keep going to the guy in the white shirt right back there?
4501840	4502840	Don't move.
4502840	4504840	You're very well lit.
4504840	4506840	Very well lit and very distinct.
4506840	4507840	No Trump's gift, everybody.
4507840	4510840	No Trump's gift for tonight.
4510840	4512840	Are you a theater person?
4512840	4514840	Because you really found your lighting.
4514840	4515840	He is a theater man.
4515840	4517840	He instinctively found his life.
4517840	4519840	That's a sentiment live.
4519840	4522840	You would be Elvis Costello and they were cut to you.
4522840	4523840	What do you think, Elvis?
4523840	4528840	Even if he wasn't well lit, he is lit by his dignity.
4528840	4531840	He's got his arms folded, but not like in the...
4532840	4534840	I'm trying to describe for listeners.
4534840	4537840	You know how you fold your arms if you are pouting?
4537840	4538840	You're closed up.
4538840	4544840	Then there's the intellectual holding one elbow with another hand.
4544840	4546840	It's contemplative.
4546840	4552840	My eyes keep darting over to him because he's so not a typical Harman-town audience member.
4552840	4553840	What is your name, by the way?
4553840	4554840	Joel.
4554840	4555840	Do you know Harman-town?
4555840	4556840	Have you heard of this?
4556840	4557840	Do you just wander in tonight?
4557840	4560840	I'm an usher.
4560840	4562840	Would you be willing to come up and talk to us?
4562840	4564840	We never bully anybody.
4564840	4565840	It's okay to say no.
4565840	4567840	Are you willing to come up and talk to us for a second?
4567840	4569840	I've been looking at him all night.
4569840	4570840	Joel.
4574840	4576840	I can honestly say this.
4576840	4582840	He's the first guy that's ever been this specific physical archetype that I've ever seen out there in the crowd.
4582840	4584840	There's an actor that he looks like.
4584840	4585840	Is it E.G. Marshall?
4585840	4587840	What is it?
4587840	4588840	Jack Lemon.
4588840	4589840	Jack Lemon.
4589840	4590840	Hal Holbrook?
4590840	4591840	A little Hal Holbrook?
4591840	4592840	Alright.
4592840	4593840	Hello, Joel.
4593840	4594840	Your name's Joel?
4594840	4595840	Joel.
4595840	4598840	And you're an usher here at the theater.
4598840	4600840	I'm an usher at the theater, yes.
4600840	4604840	It could have gone worse because my eyes can't keep off of you.
4604840	4608840	I always play to the person in the back of the room that I'm the most terrified of,
4608840	4611840	that I'm, oh, this person is going to hate me.
4611840	4616840	I'm talking about cocaine and booze and being stupid and I'm farting.
4617840	4619840	And so my eyes keep going to you to check in.
4619840	4623840	And you've never, you know, you're not pumping your fists or anything.
4623840	4625840	But you've been very supportive.
4625840	4630840	I would define you as, like, you've been smiling now and then when it passed muster with you.
4630840	4632840	Didn't give you the finger.
4632840	4633840	No, no, yeah.
4633840	4634840	You didn't get up and leave.
4634840	4636840	You didn't, yeah, moon us or anything.
4636840	4639840	Joel, well, Joel, what do you think so far about the show?
4639840	4640840	Be honest.
4640840	4641840	Like, shoot from the hip.
4641840	4642840	What do you think about this?
4642840	4644840	I find it very strange.
4647840	4649840	I really don't understand it.
4650840	4652840	It's very nice of you to say that.
4652840	4653840	All right.
4653840	4656840	Well, I don't know what I just, I had to, like, I wanted to personify him.
4656840	4660840	I didn't want him to be this, like, you know, Dan, we all have our own wants.
4660840	4661840	You want to personify him.
4661840	4664840	I want him to to rap a little bit.
4665840	4666840	Oh, no, no.
4668840	4669840	Come on, Joel.
4669840	4670840	I cannot rap.
4670840	4671840	Joel's not going to.
4671840	4672840	Me neither.
4672840	4673840	We have that in common.
4673840	4676840	How long have you been an usher here, Joel?
4677840	4679840	Actually about nine years.
4679840	4680840	Yeah.
4680840	4682840	You must be a patron of the arts.
4682840	4683840	You want to be close to it.
4683840	4684840	That's why you took the job, maybe.
4684840	4685840	Yeah.
4685840	4686840	I ushered a bunch of theaters.
4686840	4688840	This is a beautiful, beautiful theater.
4688840	4689840	This is not the only one that you ushered.
4689840	4690840	I was walking downtown.
4690840	4693840	It used to be the public theater before they moved downtown.
4693840	4695840	This was the public theater.
4695840	4697840	And you get to see all the stuff for free?
4697840	4698840	Yes.
4698840	4699840	Because you usher?
4699840	4700840	Right.
4700840	4701840	Are you married?
4701840	4702840	No.
4702840	4709840	And what's the best play that's been here in this theater this year?
4709840	4714840	Or what's the best thing you've seen in this venue here?
4715840	4723840	Oh, the Second City used to come here before they went downtown.
4723840	4724840	Oh, OK.
4724840	4726840	So you like the improv comedy?
4726840	4727840	Yes.
4727840	4728840	Oh, OK.
4728840	4729840	I like the Second City.
4729840	4730840	I'm sorry.
4731840	4737840	I'm sorry that people spontaneously coming up with humorous things to say is your forte,
4737840	4741840	because I must have let you down.
4742840	4744840	I do a different brand of thing here.
4744840	4747840	I'm sort of a low-rent, spalding gray, I guess.
4747840	4749840	But I haven't written anything of it.
4749840	4750840	OK.
4751840	4753840	Thank you, Joel.
4753840	4756840	Anything you want to plug?
4757840	4759840	Is there a sports drink you manufacture that you want people to know about?
4759840	4763840	I mean, you have the mic if there's anything you want to say.
4763840	4765840	No, I kind of hide away.
4765840	4766840	OK.
4766840	4767840	He's an usher.
4767840	4768840	He's got the usher spirit.
4768840	4770840	He wants to get back to the shadows with Joel.
4770840	4773840	And yet he found the most well-lit seat in the house.
4774840	4777840	It's like God is your flashlight.
4777840	4778840	God is ushering you.
4778840	4779840	I see.
4779840	4780840	You're right.
4780840	4781840	I'm ready to go right there.
4781840	4782840	Yeah, yeah.
4782840	4783840	But you look good in it.
4783840	4784840	I mean, it's great.
4784840	4788840	Like I said, you could have really played a mind game on me from that seat.
4788840	4791840	Every time I looked over, you could have just gone...
4794840	4796840	Well, now I can't.
4796840	4797840	Well, now you can.
4797840	4798840	You can do whatever you want, Joel.
4798840	4799840	That's what Harmon Town...
4799840	4802840	That's the only thing we have going for us is your freedom.
4802840	4803840	Thank you, Joel.
4803840	4804840	Joel, everybody.
4804840	4805840	Thank you so much, sir.
4811840	4812840	All right.
4812840	4814840	Let's bring Aaron McGathey to the stage for D&D.
4814840	4815840	Aaron.
4818840	4819840	Aaron McGathey.
4823840	4828840	Aaron steps to the igloo cooler, refreshing her ice to the...
4828840	4829840	I'm no Spencer.
4829840	4830840	I can't do it.
4830840	4831840	You can't do it.
4831840	4832840	No one can.
4833840	4834840	Hello, Aaron.
4834840	4835840	Hello, hey, guys.
4835840	4836840	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
4836840	4837840	There she is.
4837840	4838840	Did I miss anything?
4843840	4847840	I just want to say while Joel was up, I think someone's trying to date rape me.
4849840	4850840	What do you mean Spencer?
4850840	4851840	A very mysterious drink.
4851840	4853840	Somebody came up and brought my table.
4853840	4856840	Somebody came and brought what seems to be a yingling beer to you.
4856840	4859840	And there's definitely like a pill fizzing around in the bottom.
4860840	4861840	Are you kidding me?
4861840	4862840	Let me see this.
4862840	4863840	Yeah, no, I'm kidding.
4863840	4864840	Careful.
4866840	4867840	Okay, so that's you.
4868840	4869840	You, I trust.
4869840	4870840	Okay.
4870840	4871840	Is there an optical illusion, Spencer?
4871840	4872840	No, I was joking.
4872840	4873840	I was joking.
4873840	4874840	Oh, God, I thought...
4876840	4877840	Really inspecting it.
4877840	4878840	I don't know.
4880840	4882840	Yeah, I'm a little jealous.
4883840	4886840	Oh, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
4888840	4890840	Spencer, you don't even drink really, do you?
4891840	4892840	I know how.
4895840	4896840	Dungeon snap.
4898840	4899840	All right, Spencer.
4900840	4901840	Sorry, Aaron, go ahead.
4901840	4902840	Oh, nothing.
4902840	4903840	I just said wireless.
4904840	4905840	Is there anything, Aaron?
4905840	4906840	It's a wireless mic.
4906840	4907840	Because it's kind of not fair
4907840	4908840	when I talk about our relationship
4908840	4911840	and whether or not I'm a dick within it.
4911840	4912840	And then you don't have,
4912840	4913840	and now that you have the mic,
4913840	4914840	is there anything that I said
4914840	4917840	that you need to counter or clarify?
4921840	4922840	Sad woo from the audience.
4922840	4923840	Did I lie?
4923840	4924840	Did I lie about anything
4924840	4925840	that you need to correct me on?
4927840	4928840	No.
4929840	4931840	I don't think so.
4931840	4933840	I feel, I mean, at Hermiton,
4933840	4934840	I guess we're honest about our feelings.
4935840	4936840	I feel a little raw.
4937840	4939840	Well, by the two of you in general.
4940840	4942840	My cheeks weren't totally dry backstage.
4944840	4945840	I made you cry tonight?
4946840	4947840	Oh, I don't know.
4947840	4948840	During the show?
4948840	4949840	No, it's fine.
4949840	4952840	I don't want to be, I don't know.
4952840	4955840	It's kind of a bummer listening to you
4955840	4959840	talk about jerking off to a 17-year-old
4959840	4960840	with a ponytail.
4962840	4963840	Ladies?
4965840	4966840	It's fine.
4966840	4967840	I don't want it to be a thing,
4967840	4969840	because Dan and I have had this conversation
4969840	4970840	a million times over.
4970840	4972840	Are you saying you cried during that backstage?
4972840	4974840	Look, man, I'm just being honest.
4974840	4976840	I'm not saying it's the way to be.
4977840	4979840	I don't know if anyone listens to my podcast,
4979840	4980840	but I don't start it by saying,
4980840	4981840	hey, I'm perfect.
4981840	4982840	Here goes.
4983840	4985840	So I don't know.
4988840	4989840	Bum me out a little bit.
4990840	4991840	I'm sorry.
4991840	4993840	Given the sexual activity
4993840	4994840	we had this afternoon,
4994840	4997840	I felt a little, made me feel a little sad.
4997840	4999840	Because it was unreciprocated.
4999840	5000840	Because it was one-sided.
5001840	5003840	I was, I have a fever.
5004840	5006840	It's, hey, man.
5006840	5008840	It's all about, it was all about me this afternoon.
5008840	5010840	You're saying it was unreciprocated sex
5010840	5011840	that went on today?
5011840	5013840	Like Dan was being selfish in bed today?
5013840	5015840	We had two hours to get some rest.
5015840	5016840	I had a fever.
5016840	5017840	I had chills.
5017840	5019840	Like, she asked me, is there,
5019840	5021840	can I help you out?
5021840	5023840	Like, kind of, I can't remember how she put it.
5023840	5025840	I do not say, can I help you out?
5025840	5026840	I can't remember how you put it,
5026840	5029840	but my response was, is it okay if I just lay here?
5029840	5030840	It's fine.
5030840	5032840	Which was your opportunity to say no.
5032840	5034840	I'm really not upset about it.
5034840	5037840	I mean, it probably speaks more to my own insecurity,
5037840	5041840	but when, you know, when...
5041840	5043840	Well, it speaks to your desire to have sex.
5043840	5044840	On the tour, yeah.
5044840	5046840	On the tour, things are slower sexually.
5046840	5048840	So when I watch you on stage,
5048840	5052840	fantasize about a volleyball-playing 72-year-old,
5052840	5056840	I want to kill myself, because I'm like, well, I'm not that.
5056840	5058840	And I wish I was.
5058840	5060840	I have red hair.
5060840	5063840	No, I don't wish I was.
5063840	5064840	Okay.
5064840	5065840	Well, I understand that.
5065840	5066840	That wasn't supposed to be a black forest,
5066840	5067840	so I was just...
5067840	5068840	And yet it was.
5068840	5069840	Yeah, and yet it was.
5069840	5070840	And yet it was.
5070840	5071840	And yet it was.
5071840	5072840	No, I don't know.
5072840	5074840	I just, I guess after last night
5074840	5075840	and the last couple of days,
5075840	5076840	I feel a little low.
5077840	5078840	I feel a little defeated.
5078840	5080840	I don't feel super...
5080840	5085840	I guess maybe I don't feel...
5085840	5087840	I love you, but I don't feel super hyped
5087840	5090840	on our relationship right now.
5090840	5093840	Um, but...
5098840	5101840	Well, I'll see what I can do about that
5101840	5102840	before Minneapolis...
5102840	5103840	But I...
5103840	5104840	I'm not...
5104840	5106840	I'm not saying I want to break up or anything.
5106840	5107840	I just feel a little...
5107840	5108840	I just feel...
5108840	5110840	My heart's a little chafed.
5110840	5111840	I used to be really fat,
5111840	5113840	and when I would go to a water park,
5113840	5114840	my thighs would get all red and bloody,
5114840	5117840	and that's what my heart feels like.
5117840	5120840	Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
5121840	5122840	Hey, Joel...
5122840	5123840	My D&D!
5123840	5125840	Joel, take it easy back there, would you?
5125840	5128840	Joel's now pumping his fists.
5128840	5130840	But I think the show is going great.
5130840	5132840	I think Pittsburgh's awesome.
5133840	5136840	It's one of the top three towns in the nation to break up,
5136840	5138840	and did you guys know that?
5139840	5141840	Your dream!
5141840	5145840	Everyone at the merch table is so cool and so nice,
5145840	5147840	and it was great.
5147840	5150840	Spencer, I hate to call it audible,
5150840	5152840	because you prepared this stuff,
5152840	5157840	but you're very willing to adapt on the fly to stuff that we do.
5157840	5160840	Maybe is there a way, during this little fantasy segment
5160840	5165840	that we do in D&D, for Dan and Aaron's characters
5165840	5168840	to maybe find some sort of connection,
5168840	5169840	maybe patch up some of these wounds?
5169840	5170840	Is that possible?
5170840	5171840	Uh, yeah.
5171840	5172840	All right.
5172840	5174840	Well, then, Spencer, if you would,
5174840	5176840	catch us up to date.
5177840	5180840	When we last met, our heroes had just hijacked
5180840	5184840	a flying airship piloted by Dave.
5184840	5186840	The airship seemed to be damaged,
5186840	5189840	and the gang raced around trying to fix it,
5189840	5192840	and just after they thought they had it all under control,
5192840	5195840	a shake rattled the hole.
5195840	5197840	The gang awoke in the wreckage of their ship
5197840	5201840	and in the midst of a deep, dark red cave,
5201840	5205840	approached by seven humans and a halfling.
5205840	5211840	A chorus of people approached our heroes in the deep of this cave.
5211840	5214840	As our heroes met the tribesmen,
5214840	5218840	they realized that they had been swallowed by a great beast,
5218840	5220840	known only as the Infinifish.
5220840	5222840	There was this weird point in the show where, for some reason,
5222840	5223840	I don't know how...
5223840	5224840	Wasn't lying.
5224840	5227840	We brought all the black people in the audience onto the stage.
5227840	5229840	There were eight black people.
5229840	5231840	You did it, but you pulled them on stage.
5231840	5232840	What's that?
5232840	5233840	I said, the way how is it?
5233840	5236840	You said, let's bring all the black people on stage.
5236840	5237840	Right.
5237840	5238840	I don't know how we got to that point.
5238840	5242840	So there was a Greek chorus of all of our black god against members
5242840	5245840	up there, and they were kind of our guides
5245840	5247840	through the bowels of the Infinifish.
5247840	5250840	They took you through some meat curtains.
5250840	5253840	They did a dance that opened the way forward,
5253840	5257840	and you got to their village, which is where you are now.
5257840	5258840	Perfect.
5258840	5260840	Again, nine seconds left on the track,
5260840	5262840	and he knows exactly how to end it.
5262840	5263840	Back is ending.
5263840	5266840	All right, so let's examine our surroundings.
5266840	5268840	You're in this red cave-ish area.
5268840	5272840	The walls are fleshy and pustules of glowing golden fluid
5272840	5275840	line the walls, casting light over the area.
5275840	5278840	Several scrap hovels have been shored together
5278840	5282840	from various pits of pieces of ship and or crates
5282840	5284840	and or other items.
5284840	5287840	There's about 17 or 18 of these dwellings,
5287840	5292840	and they seem quite, you know, modest but workable.
5292840	5293840	Cozy?
5293840	5297840	Yeah, cozy for inside of an animal.
5297840	5299840	The people are just hanging around now.
5299840	5302840	They're just going back to their business.
5302840	5304840	So are you going to play all these people, Spencer?
5304840	5307840	I can play all of them, any of them, none of them,
5307840	5308840	whatever has to happen.
5308840	5310840	Okay.
5310840	5312840	I, Quark.
5312840	5315840	Did you want to get the black people in Pittsburgh to come over?
5315840	5316840	Let's bring them out.
5316840	5317840	Pittsburgh black people.
5317840	5320840	That was a joke suggestion.
5320840	5322840	I don't know how I felt about having done it.
5322840	5323840	It was an organic thing.
5323840	5325840	Halfway through it, I was like, what are we doing?
5325840	5327840	We're dehumanizing black people.
5327840	5332840	It started as a thing that was supposed to re-humanize
5332840	5334840	and express ironic, like, white guilt.
5334840	5336840	And then there was, you know, when you, when you
5336840	5338840	arrange people in a big, long line and give them one
5338840	5341840	microphone for seven, that's like the opposite effect
5341840	5342840	for me, emotionally.
5342840	5345840	I think they had a good time, but, you know, I can't
5345840	5346840	really access them emotionally.
5346840	5348840	So I don't know.
5348840	5351840	I seek out the elder or leader of this, of this group of people.
5351840	5354840	That's the female chieftain that you met in Arlington.
5354840	5355840	I approach her.
5355840	5356840	You approach her.
5356840	5358840	I say, what's up?
5358840	5360840	I hope you find our village to your liking.
5360840	5362840	It's not much, but it's all we have.
5362840	5365840	You know, we don't get very much stuff down here,
5365840	5370840	but my friend Phil owns this shop down the lane.
5370840	5374840	There's also an end to your right if you need to sleep.
5374840	5375840	We got some stuff.
5375840	5377840	I'm sorry we don't have much, but it's the inside
5377840	5380840	of a friggin' beast.
5380840	5382840	We probably definitely need some sleep at this point,
5382840	5383840	I can imagine, right?
5383840	5386840	Well, you know, I'm bush, and I notice some strange
5386840	5389840	tension between Mulray and Sedana and Sharpie,
5389840	5390840	but that's a lot.
5390840	5394840	So I find the nearest humble dwelling that a known barbarian
5394840	5397840	might find, and I hit the hay.
5397840	5400840	That happens.
5400840	5402840	You take your leave gracefully.
5402840	5406840	I find a reflective surface on a wall,
5406840	5410840	and I walk over to it, and I brush my hair.
5410840	5413840	You find no reflective surface.
5414840	5419840	I walk over to some sort of wall,
5419840	5421840	and I imagine that there's something there,
5421840	5423840	and I stare at it, and I brush my hair.
5423840	5425840	Okay.
5425840	5431840	You look beautiful since becoming a woman.
5431840	5433840	Thank you, Sharpie.
5433840	5441840	Okay, said some things back in the epiglottis that...
5441840	5443840	I regret, I guess.
5443840	5444840	You guess?
5444840	5447840	You guess you regret them, or you actually regret them?
5447840	5450840	Well, I regret making you feel bad.
5450840	5452840	I don't want to do that.
5452840	5453840	I like you and respect you.
5453840	5456840	But if I hadn't felt bad, everything you said
5456840	5458840	would have been fine?
5458840	5459840	I don't know.
5459840	5463840	Like, I mean, it's like...
5463840	5468840	How much like, I don't know, tap dancing
5468840	5471840	do you want done for your sake, you know?
5471840	5472840	Very little.
5472840	5473840	Very little.
5473840	5474840	Very little.
5474840	5477840	All I have to do is just not say certain stuff
5477840	5479840	during a show that I'm doing.
5479840	5482840	Like, all I have to do is think about you.
5482840	5483840	No, I...
5483840	5484840	All right, pause.
5484840	5486840	D&D, pause.
5486840	5487840	Oh, it was on pause.
5487840	5489840	Yeah.
5489840	5492840	I was just being open about my feelings,
5492840	5496840	and I qualified it by saying that I think it's just about my insecurity.
5496840	5498840	After the show, I wouldn't give you a note saying,
5498840	5499840	I don't think you should have done that bit,
5499840	5501840	because I think it was fine.
5501840	5503840	Artistically, I think it was totally cool.
5503840	5505840	And I just said I was sorry that you were hurt.
5505840	5507840	I said, I'm sorry that you were hurt, which is the truth.
5507840	5508840	Okay, that's fine.
5508840	5511840	And your question was, you're sorry that I was hurt,
5511840	5514840	but if I wasn't hurt, you would have thought that was okay.
5514840	5515840	So here we go.
5515840	5516840	Now, that's a note.
5516840	5517840	That's a behavioral adjustment.
5517840	5520840	Well, I mean, Dan, I was being Maureen.
5520840	5521840	What?
5522840	5526840	Well, let's back up a little.
5526840	5529840	We're actually going to talk about this in front of all of our best friends.
5529840	5531840	Can I get you guys a couple drinks?
5535840	5539840	When we had that fight the other night, you apologized.
5539840	5542840	And then in the morning, I was still feeling sad.
5542840	5545840	And I said to you, I still feel sad about this.
5545840	5548840	And your response was, so what?
5548840	5551840	Yeah, because we had a fucking drunken fight the previous night,
5551840	5552840	and it's not.
5552840	5556840	But you slung a lot of arrows.
5556840	5557840	Arrows!
5561840	5564840	So it was a lot.
5564840	5565840	It was a lot.
5565840	5567840	It was more than usual.
5567840	5573840	But after talking about it on stage last night, I was fine.
5573840	5577840	And hypothetically, I'm fine now.
5577840	5580840	I guess I'm feeling a little insecure.
5580840	5586840	I feel a little undesirable.
5586840	5590840	Well, you're the hottest girlfriend I've ever had.
5590840	5591840	Oh, thank you.
5591840	5598840	Is that the, I mean, because it seems like,
5598840	5603840	I realize that we all have kind of fundamental needs
5603840	5606840	to feel sexy and stuff.
5606840	5611840	But there's a certain point at which, I love you.
5611840	5612840	I'm in love with you.
5612840	5614840	I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
5614840	5621840	And the idea that a piece of pornography or a primal urge
5621840	5623840	is somehow a threat to you.
5623840	5625840	It's just when, no, no, it's not that.
5625840	5634840	So when you show me less that you're attracted to me
5634840	5637840	than those things creep into my brain.
5637840	5642840	But when you are in a mode where you show me that you care about me,
5642840	5645840	and ladies, it doesn't take a lot, right?
5645840	5647840	It takes very little.
5647840	5649840	You look nice today.
5649840	5653840	Or, gosh, I'm so busy.
5653840	5656840	I wish I could have sex with you right now, but I got to go to work.
5656840	5658840	Just little, very little.
5658840	5665840	It's so, women are so much lower maintenance than men think.
5665840	5672840	So when we're on tour, so everything's fucked up,
5672840	5676840	and it's hard for you to, it's slash impossible for you
5676840	5682840	to pay me the attention that I need because I am just as broken as you.
5682840	5684840	Hence why I'm in this relationship with you.
5684840	5689840	I don't think that someone super healthy would fall in love with you.
5689840	5693840	And that's not a dis. That's love.
5693840	5701840	So in the same way that you flipped out at my high school reunion
5701840	5705840	because some douchebag was hitting on me,
5705840	5710840	I just need a pat on the head.
5710840	5714840	I don't know. I'll get you later.
5714840	5716840	It's all fine.
5716840	5719840	I did that today.
5719840	5722840	You did. You pat me on the head today.
5722840	5725840	I'm not mad about the 17-year-old thing.
5725840	5729840	I'm just feeling insecure, that's all.
5729840	5734840	And after last night, two nights ago, things are a little raw.
5734840	5735840	Everything's fine.
5735840	5737840	I think feeling insecure is awesome.
5737840	5739840	I stand up here and talk about what makes me feel insecure.
5739840	5742840	All the people in this audience come up to me after the show
5742840	5745840	and shake my hand and tell me about the things that make them feel insecure.
5745840	5750840	Everyone that listens to this podcast instead of Rob Schneider's
5750840	5755840	agrees that expressing insecurity is worth something.
5755840	5762840	However, then there's this line between expressing insecurity and what?
5763840	5766840	You think that I'm trying to get you to do something?
5766840	5767840	Right.
5767840	5770840	So you feel insecure when something happens
5770840	5771840	and then I say to someone that loves you,
5771840	5776840	oh my God, I'm so sorry that you got splashed by things that made you feel bad.
5776840	5777840	Let me help you.
5777840	5779840	I am so sorry you feel bad.
5779840	5787840	And then you say, but you think that that's acceptable behavior.
5787840	5789840	You're not going to do that anymore, right?
5789840	5791840	Or whatever the hell, however you phrased it before.
5791840	5795840	You express the fact that the things that I do
5795840	5798840	are the things that make you feel insecure
5798840	5803840	and you imply that in order for you to feel good about yourself,
5803840	5806840	my behavior has to shift and change.
5806840	5808840	And then I go into defense mode.
5808840	5809840	Right.
5809840	5811840	I think that's mostly in your head.
5811840	5812840	I think that's in your head.
5812840	5813840	Okay.
5813840	5814840	Well, it's been recorded.
5814840	5817840	It's not in my head now.
5817840	5821840	It's over a sound system and it's on tape.
5821840	5822840	We can rewind it.
5822840	5824840	We can play it on the bus and let's talk about it.
5824840	5826840	Maybe it's when someone apologizes for certain behavior.
5826840	5828840	They assume that the other person is saying,
5828840	5831840	I'm sorry for this and I'll try to do something different.
5831840	5833840	But are you telling me that when you apologize for something,
5833840	5837840	you say, I'm sorry, I dropped the vase.
5837840	5839840	I'm not going to try to not drop it anymore.
5839840	5840840	Yes, yes.
5840840	5844840	As uncharismatic as it sounds because now we're not in a comedy mode.
5844840	5847840	So, so now the joke is gone.
5847840	5848840	We're outside of it.
5848840	5852840	So just as like when they bring Eminem on CNN and have him read his rap lyrics
5852840	5853840	and do you think this is appropriate?
5853840	5857840	I'm not going to sound very charismatic when I say yes.
5857840	5862840	I don't, I don't, I don't think it was that bad to do the joke of having a,
5862840	5865840	a, a, a weird petty fantasy.
5865840	5868840	I don't think it was either.
5868840	5869840	I don't think it was either.
5869840	5870840	I was just saying that I felt insecure.
5870840	5872840	So you asked me and I said,
5872840	5874840	and I said, I'm sorry that you feel insecure.
5874840	5876840	And then you said, and then you implied,
5876840	5879840	then you went into that territory of, so you're going to change.
5879840	5880840	Right.
5880840	5883840	And the answer is not in that specific context.
5883840	5884840	No, I don't think so.
5884840	5885840	I'm probably going to continue to.
5885840	5890840	Well, then, then I was misunderstood or I misspoke.
5890840	5893840	I didn't mean to imply that I thought that you should do something differently
5893840	5898840	in that way.
5898840	5900840	We will, we will rewind it in the bus and we'll,
5900840	5901840	we'll update people.
5901840	5902840	Spencer.
5902840	5903840	Oh, that Aaron.
5903840	5904840	Oh.
5904840	5905840	Aaron.
5905840	5906840	Aaron.
5906840	5907840	Aaron.
5907840	5908840	Aaron.
5908840	5909840	Aaron.
5909840	5912840	When you, someone in the second, what's your, what's your name?
5912840	5913840	Brad.
5913840	5917840	When Brad said it's all Aaron's fault, I was really just like, okay.
5917840	5918840	Yeah.
5918840	5919840	Yes.
5919840	5920840	Okay.
5920840	5922840	What's amazing is the guy that Dan was pretend fantasizing about and trying to
5922840	5924840	get a hard on for his name was Aaron.
5924840	5926840	I didn't even put that together.
5926840	5929840	I was, this, this was my process backstage.
5929840	5931840	I heard that bit and I was like, God damn it.
5931840	5934840	And then I was like, look, Aaron, if you were doing a show and your bit was
5934840	5938840	that you needed to get wet for somebody, everyone would think it was stupid
5938840	5942840	and gay and retarded, not, not gay, homosexual.
5942840	5944840	And not retarded, disabled.
5944840	5946840	And I'm thinking about.
5946840	5947840	Gay and retarded.
5947840	5949840	Gay and retarded.
5949840	5950840	Yeah.
5950840	5951840	She said.
5951840	5954840	I hate retarded people.
5954840	5955840	JK you guys.
5955840	5959840	But I like, it would be really, it would be really stupid and not funny if I
5959840	5963840	got up and in that bit said, Oh, I'm imagining Dan Harmon.
5963840	5964840	Exactly.
5964840	5965840	And he's writing.
5965840	5966840	Yes.
5966840	5967840	I agree.
5967840	5968840	I was only speaking to my insecurity.
5968840	5970840	I don't think that you should stop.
5970840	5973840	I was just, I was just speaking without a filter about how I feel.
5973840	5974840	And I said, I'm sorry.
5974840	5975840	Feelings are complicated.
5975840	5977840	No one told you not to express your feelings.
5977840	5978840	And then I said, I'm sorry.
5978840	5979840	So what did I do wrong?
5979840	5980840	And here we go.
5980840	5981840	We keep coming back to this point.
5981840	5982840	Brad, what did I do wrong?
5982840	5984840	What it, what it, what is happening?
5984840	5987840	Please tell me what happened.
5987840	5992840	I think you need to stare at Aaron and, and, and do the same thing to Dan.
5992840	5994840	I think it's the only way.
5994840	5997840	It's the only way to save it.
5997840	5999840	An eye for an eye.
5999840	6002840	Well.
6002840	6007840	Aaron, Aaron, mail Aaron said, or you can stare at my wife.
6007840	6013840	And oddly enough, that's when the show rounded a bend.
6013840	6014840	Okay.
6014840	6015840	All right.
6015840	6016840	Spencer.
6016840	6023840	I take my flaming sword and, and, and attack the tension in the room.
6023840	6033840	Critical hit.
6033840	6034840	Interesting enough.
6034840	6036840	This is a lot like Dan for realsies.
6036840	6038840	I wasn't telling you to stop doing that.
6038840	6039840	Okay.
6039840	6040840	Okay.
6040840	6041840	Well, good.
6041840	6042840	I'm sorry.
6042840	6043840	I'll do that.
6043840	6044840	Because that is exactly the message I received.
6044840	6045840	And I love you.
6045840	6048840	And what I would never do this with, with, with anyone.
6048840	6052840	I've never been in a relationship like this.
6052840	6056840	I critically hit the tension.
6056840	6059840	I, that's why I'm saying to her, I love you.
6059840	6061840	I don't want anything to ever hurt you.
6061840	6062840	I want to be with you forever.
6062840	6065840	I, I'm perfectly capable of saying that.
6065840	6070840	Um, uh, like, like, like, like, I, it's not like, like, like, everything else is like,
6070840	6075840	cosmetic, like weird behavioral adjustment that I don't, that I don't cotton to, you
6075840	6078840	know, I, I love you too.
6078840	6080840	And I'm, I'm perfect.
6080840	6083840	And sometimes I will feel bad.
6083840	6085840	Sometimes I'll feel bad about things.
6085840	6089840	And I'm just telling you how I feel about something and I'm not giving you a note.
6089840	6090840	Okay.
6090840	6092840	You don't want to change me.
6092840	6093840	I don't want to change you.
6093840	6094840	I don't want to change you.
6094840	6096840	There'd be too many changes.
6096840	6098840	Uh, hypothetically.
6098840	6099840	I mean, I don't.
6099840	6102840	I think you're, you're perfect and you're imperfection.
6102840	6103840	Okay.
6103840	6104840	So where's goose keys at you guys?
6104840	6106840	Where do we, where do we go?
6106840	6108840	But I love you very much.
6108840	6109840	I'm sorry.
6109840	6114840	We should, you guys could, you, you two should keep, uh, I guess let's all just quietly sneak
6114840	6116840	out and go to goose keys.
6116840	6120840	Dan, Dan, can I ask you something?
6120840	6121840	Yeah.
6121840	6124840	Can I move in with you after the tour?
6124840	6125840	Wow.
6125840	6130840	A hairpin, a hairpin turn.
6130840	6136840	Uh, do, do you think, can I ask the answer that question for the question?
6136840	6139840	Do you think these are healthy circumstances under which to get a yes?
6139840	6144840	Uh, no, I just think they're good for the show.
6144840	6146840	Uh, okay.
6146840	6149840	I wait for my sleep, Spencer.
6149840	6154840	And I walk into the hut where Sharpie and Mulrain are talking and I enter the hut and
6154840	6158840	I go, oh boy, I had a really healthy night's sleep.
6158840	6159840	Uh, holy moly.
6159840	6160840	What did you guys do?
6160840	6161840	What'd you talk about?
6161840	6164840	Uh, I was, it was the upshot.
6164840	6166840	I don't, I don't want to go through a big thing.
6166840	6167840	What's the headlines?
6167840	6174840	We, we, we dreamt of a, of a, of a futuristic world where, uh, our voices were louder than
6174840	6175840	they should be.
6175840	6182840	And, uh, and a chorus of angels watched us argue about things that only made sense in
6182840	6183840	that world.
6183840	6184840	Uh, so welcome.
6184840	6185840	Uh, cool sword.
6185840	6186840	Thank you.
6186840	6189840	Mike and Jen got this from me.
6189840	6190840	Isn't it?
6190840	6191840	It's gorgeous.
6191840	6196840	You know, uh, Mike sculpted all this, uh, all the, the, uh, foam on this.
6196840	6197840	He didn't just buy it this way.
6197840	6198840	He sculpted it.
6198840	6199840	Why don't you fuck him?
6199840	6204840	And we're back.
6204840	6209840	The greatest adventure.
6209840	6210840	Reset.
6210840	6211840	All right.
6211840	6212840	We'll edit it out.
6212840	6213840	No, the fuck you will.
6213840	6214840	That stays in, baby.
6214840	6215840	All it stays in.
6215840	6216840	You think the director of the documentary is like, he's backstage.
6216840	6237840	Like, uh, like the guy from the Highlander, like, he's having the opposite experience
6237840	6238840	of the audience.
6238840	6240840	It's inversely and proportionate.
6240840	6245840	They're like, well, God, my God, the babysitter is going to make $90 tonight.
6245840	6252840	And Neil's like, yeah, the power of grace go.
6252840	6254840	Oh man.
6254840	6260840	Has there ever been a podcast where, uh, boyfriend and girlfriend got into it that much?
6260840	6262840	I mean, maybe I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.
6262840	6263840	That's pretty wild, right?
6263840	6265840	Let's not congratulate ourselves too much.
6265840	6267840	Let's take the time they gave us.
6267840	6270840	I was saying there's a reason why there isn't a lot of those.
6270840	6271840	I don't know.
6271840	6272840	Yeah.
6272840	6273840	It's a ratings disaster.
6273840	6278840	I fucking, I mean, it's, you know, I don't know for anybody's sadness or uncomfortability,
6278840	6282840	but it's, it's, it's very fascinating to sit this close to that kind of conversation.
6282840	6287840	And the fact that you're so absolutely comfortable doing that in front of people, there's 17 cameras
6287840	6292840	in here and there's 200 people and you guys just bear your souls as if we're not even
6292840	6297840	here, which makes me believe that you don't think we're here.
6297840	6299840	Which is the definition of sociopathy.
6299840	6302840	You're both so narcissistic that you don't know.
6302840	6307840	I am sitting over here and going to the camera.
6307840	6312840	Can't we both join forces and fail to consider the entire world's feelings?
6312840	6313840	Sure.
6313840	6314840	Yeah.
6314840	6315840	Wait, how about this?
6315840	6322840	Let me, uh, you guys should just cast Ray of Frost on other people's knowledge of your existence.
6322840	6324840	I don't know what that means.
6324840	6326840	It's a level zero spell.
6326840	6331840	I think it's fascinating that you guys are, I don't, I mean, I'm not easily embarrassed.
6331840	6336840	I don't know that I could sit in front of this group of people and like turn this into Sally Jessie Raphael.
6336840	6339840	Spencer, we're attacked by monogamy.
6339840	6341840	Go.
6341840	6348840	Creeping into the room, you hear the dull monotonous thuds of your significant other.
6348840	6354840	You roll over and pretend you're not awake.
6354840	6355840	He's a goddamn genius.
6355840	6356840	What kind of pressure do you think I'm under?
6356840	6360840	I have a better writer sitting next to me who's half my age.
6360840	6361840	I took him on this tour.
6361840	6363840	I was like inviting a homeless person to Thanksgiving.
6363840	6365840	You know, I'm being a big charitable guy.
6365840	6368840	Let's take the dungeon master on the, on the, on the rock bus.
6368840	6370840	He's a fucking genius.
6370840	6371840	I am dead in the water.
6371840	6373840	I was supposed to be writing my Fox pilot.
6373840	6374840	I fucking blew it.
6374840	6377840	I turned the CBS one in, but my career is dying back home.
6377840	6379840	And this guy is ascending to stardom.
6379840	6382840	He is empowering somebody.
6382840	6383840	That's more important.
6383840	6384840	It is.
6384840	6385840	I know.
6385840	6391840	That's why I'm a great person because a lesser man would be really, really sabotaging you.
6391840	6393840	You're a very threatening person.
6393840	6394840	I love you.
6394840	6397840	God damn it.
6397840	6398840	What's that?
6398840	6399840	Oh, he's not from Alaska.
6399840	6400840	He's not from Alaska.
6400840	6401840	Yeah.
6401840	6404840	The last thing I'm going to do is go, why would you say that?
6404840	6410840	We just talked for 90 minutes about something where you could have asked that every 30 seconds.
6410840	6412840	All right.
6412840	6416840	Let's get back to the game and let's just bring this thing into the, into the station on a dime.
6416840	6417840	All right.
6417840	6418840	Pittsburgh steel dime.
6418840	6423840	You're on track to live in the belly of this fish for the rest of your life right now.
6423840	6424840	Right.
6424840	6425840	It's an infinite fish.
6425840	6428840	And my mom, what did my mom say that nursery rhyme about the infinite fish?
6428840	6430840	Did she teach you?
6430840	6431840	She was right.
6431840	6432840	All right.
6432840	6436840	So clearly these people, they couldn't get out of here for a reason.
6436840	6442840	Did they lack some sort of knowledge or tool that we have to get out of the infinite fish?
6442840	6443840	Maybe.
6443840	6447840	I approached the wall with the yellow pustules on it and examined those.
6447840	6449840	You examine the pustules.
6449840	6455840	They seem to secrete a vicious odor as well as light, casting light into the room.
6456840	6461840	I take a throwing knife and stand back 12 paces and throw throwing knife into one of the pustules and see what happens.
6461840	6465840	The pustule pops with a sickening burst.
6465840	6467840	Sickly through it.
6467840	6470840	Well, he's doing that.
6470840	6475840	I want to ask around and see if I can find the person that they acknowledge as being in charge, like their leader.
6475840	6476840	Yeah.
6476840	6478840	You meet up with the person Cork was talking to.
6478840	6479840	That lady.
6479840	6480840	Okay.
6480840	6482840	The chieftain lady.
6482840	6483840	Okay.
6483840	6484840	Yeah.
6484840	6485840	Yeah.
6485840	6486840	How can I help you?
6486840	6487840	You know, do you want a house?
6487840	6488840	Oh, yeah.
6488840	6489840	There was a shop.
6489840	6490840	Her friend knows a shop.
6490840	6491840	Her friend Phil, right?
6491840	6492840	Yep.
6492840	6493840	Phil the shopkeep.
6493840	6495840	I run down to Phil's shop.
6495840	6496840	Hey, I'm Phil.
6496840	6497840	I sell stuff.
6497840	6503840	I don't got much, but sometimes cargo vessels get ate and I sell them things.
6503840	6504840	All right.
6504840	6505840	Do you want any things?
6505840	6507840	I got healing potions.
6507840	6513840	I got these syringes full of some sort of paralyzing goop.
6513840	6519840	It's good for calming down the monster, and we don't get cable down here, so it's fine.
6519840	6524840	It seems to me, Jeff, that what we need to do, and don't ask me where I got this idea,
6524840	6529840	is we need to make this giant monster that we're inside puke.
6529840	6532840	Monster House, 2009.
6532840	6533840	Wait.
6533840	6535840	I have smoke sticks.
6535840	6537840	Should I light a bunch of my smoke sticks?
6537840	6538840	Yeah.
6538840	6544840	I can hit the fish's uvula with an arrow.
6544840	6548840	I say because the show is getting to the point where we're going long that we buy all the
6548840	6549840	good stuff that we need.
6549840	6550840	I'll buy those healing potions.
6550840	6556840	Let's go shopping, and let's embark on the adventure next time, probably, right?
6556840	6557840	Yeah.
6557840	6558840	That sounds good.
6558840	6559840	Okay.
6559840	6561840	I can part with some potions, 50 apiece.
6561840	6564840	The syringes are going to run you 250.
6564840	6565840	I'll take the potions.
6565840	6566840	You guys get the syringes.
6566840	6567840	You guys got a fair amount of money.
6567840	6568840	All right.
6568840	6569840	I'll take some syringes.
6569840	6570840	All right.
6570840	6572840	Is there anything else?
6572840	6574840	Do you guys want any?
6574840	6575840	I got a rope.
6575840	6578840	I got a signed picture of Derek Jeter.
6578840	6580840	Holy shit.
6580840	6581840	Derek Jeter?
6581840	6582840	Yeah.
6582840	6585840	He's a great cleric of renown.
6585840	6587840	I'm a Pirates fan.
6587840	6589840	I'll take some rope.
6589840	6590840	Some rope.
6590840	6591840	Okay.
6591840	6592840	You get 40 feet of rope.
6592840	6594840	It only costs a meager amount of silver.
6594840	6595840	All right.
6595840	6601840	So basically, D&D, the people came and brought us awesome swords and ray of frost thingies,
6601840	6604840	and all we did was talk about relationships and go shopping.
6604840	6606840	Spencer, everybody.
6606840	6608840	Yay.
6612840	6613840	Erin McGathey.
6613840	6614840	Yeah.
6614840	6617840	Thank you, everyone, for indulging that conversation.
6617840	6619840	Sorry if it became weird.
6619840	6620840	Thank you, Spencer.
6620840	6621840	Thank you, Erin.
6621840	6622840	Wow.
6623840	6625840	No, it's around.
6628840	6634840	One more time for the beautifully awkward relationship between Dan Harmon and Erin McGathey.
6638840	6641840	I'm going to start my own podcast called That Felt Terrible.
6642840	6644840	I think that's why Joel's not married.
6644840	6646840	Remember when Joel came up?
6646840	6647840	Yeah.
6647840	6648840	The well-lit Joel back there?
6648840	6651840	Joel escapes the hero of this whole story.
6652840	6658840	So after all that, she walks off stage, and you deify being a bachelor.
6658840	6660840	I'm an entertainer, Jeff.
6660840	6662840	It's in my blood.
6662840	6664840	I go for the laugh.
6664840	6667840	I didn't get it, but go for it.
6667840	6673840	Well, as an entertainer, Dan, the burden is on you right now to tie this little package,
6673840	6676840	whatever we did here tonight, in the Hazelit Theater in Pittsburgh.
6676840	6679840	And I think we really take advantage of these wireless mics.
6680840	6685840	Yeah, you can really walk around, like, use the space.
6686840	6687840	What do you do it for?
6687840	6689840	You want to wrap this up in song right now?
6689840	6690840	Or do you want to go talk to people?
6690840	6691840	What do you want to do?
6691840	6692840	No, no.
6692840	6697840	Let's wrap it up and meet people at the same time with a beautiful song about everyone
6697840	6699840	in this beautiful city.
6705840	6706840	Yeah.
6707840	6711840	This beautiful citadel of steel, rivets.
6712840	6716840	They're cold, but your hearts aren't.
6720840	6731840	I met a guy named Steve today, and I said he was gay, but it's okay if you are in Harman Town.
6733840	6735840	So far, so good.
6737840	6740840	You've made yourself hysterical.
6740840	6744840	Just the idea that that's entertainment is funny to me.
6744840	6746840	I guess that's pretty meta.
6748840	6750840	I like your hat.
6750840	6752840	What's your name?
6753840	6754840	Whoa!
6754840	6755840	Wow.
6755840	6758840	Harman Town.
6758840	6761840	Magical things happen in Harman Town.
6761840	6762840	What's your name?
6762840	6763840	Steve again.
6763840	6764840	Steve again.
6765840	6773840	I fucked your mama nine times and ten, and the Steelers didn't go to the division championships.
6773840	6780840	Because Harman Town and everything involved in football is stupid.
6780840	6787840	Everything's dumb, because it's stupid to throw a ball when you don't have to hit anything with it.
6787840	6793840	It's all a bunch of shitty crap, but it's okay to enjoy it.
6793840	6797840	Every little Pittsburgh boy and girl lit with... fuck it.
6797840	6800840	Harman Town.
6800840	6802840	Beautiful theater.
6802840	6805840	I see a guy that looks like Tom Baker.
6805840	6809840	I see a guy with a check shirt maker.
6809840	6811840	This isn't working.
6811840	6813840	I'm not that talented.
6813840	6819840	Striped shirt, regular shirt, black shirt, scarf and a bra.
6820840	6823840	Sweat shirt, bra.
6823840	6825840	Crew cotton hat.
6825840	6827840	Who should have said Shake Orbus?
6827840	6828840	Holy shit.
6828840	6829840	Hey, buddy.
6829840	6830840	How you doing?
6830840	6835840	I knew this guy when I was 19 years old in Milwaukee when we did comedy sports together.
6835840	6837840	Holy shit.
6837840	6838840	Wow.
6838840	6840840	He's the son of Bob Orbus.
6840840	6843840	My original mentor in Harman Town.
6843840	6848840	He taught me how to be funny, and obviously he failed.
6848840	6858840	He doesn't make that much money because his job was to make me able to do what that one guy did with the Irish joke in Harman Town.
6858840	6859840	Wait.
6859840	6861840	Harman Town.
6861840	6868840	Everybody sing Harman Town, where he is yellow and the moon is brown.
6868840	6871840	I play guitar on your mama's titties at ground round.
6871840	6877840	I put your mama on a sled and a kite, and I flew her in the air and said, I'll take a bite.
6877840	6881840	And I think I better chip a chop because she's a cookie.
6881840	6883840	What a bitch.
6883840	6886840	She's a cookie to me.
6886840	6888840	I objectify women like that.
6888840	6889840	I'm so sorry.
6889840	6891840	I should compensate.
6891840	6895840	Tip my hat to all the ladies in the Harman Town.
6895840	6900840	I put your mama, but I love the ladies in Harman Town.
6900840	6902840	Harman Town.
6902840	6904840	Horrible stage.
6905840	6907840	Good crawl.
6907840	6909840	Harman Town.
6909840	6911840	Harman Town.
6911840	6913840	Let's go to stage drive.
6913840	6914840	Stage?
6914840	6916840	That's just you reclining on people.
6916840	6917840	That's the way.
6917840	6918840	All right.
6918840	6919840	Okay.
6919840	6920840	All right.
6920840	6921840	Daddy needs his medicine.
6921840	6923840	Harman Town.
6923840	6925840	Go to Joe.
6925840	6926840	Joe.
6926840	6932840	Joe is an usher and he leads people in and he sits in the shadows and requires no sin.
6932840	6936840	He just watches other people take the spotlight but don't deserve it.
6936840	6939840	But tonight, Joe is the hero.
6939840	6941840	Say a word.
6941840	6944840	Bird.
6944840	6946840	He's as free as a bird.
6946840	6951840	Joe's a white-shirted angel in Pittsburgh.
6951840	6954840	It's a city that makes all the cities.
6954840	6958840	And I sucked your mama's titties.
6958840	6960840	Harman Town.
6960840	6963840	Frank Yellman from Harman Town tonight.
6963840	6964840	Harman Town.
6964840	6966840	I just gave this thank you so much.
6966840	6967840	It's a little more time.
6967840	6970840	Suspense your victim.
6970840	6972840	Whoa.
6972840	6973840	And McGathey.
6973840	6975840	Whoa.
6975840	6978840	Hype and Jen are the beautiful artwork.
6978840	6980840	Are you into the rap battle of this?
6980840	6981840	Whoa.
6981840	6984840	Joe, thank you so much, sir.
6984840	6987840	Whoa.
6987840	6989840	They're all going to goose keys, right?
6989840	6991840	They're all going to goose keys?
6991840	6992840	We're all going to goose keys.
6992840	6994840	If you bought anything, I'll sign anything.
6994840	6996840	It'll take hours, but whatever.
6996840	6997840	You guys, we're very patient.
6997840	6999840	Make sure outside, you guys.
6999840	7000840	I fucking love Pittsburgh.
7000840	7002840	You guys are the best, man.
7002840	7004840	Everybody else.
7004840	7006840	God bless you, Pittsburgh.
7006840	7008840	Stay steel.
