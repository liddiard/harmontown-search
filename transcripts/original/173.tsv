0	23640	From New York, California, at the Gramercy Theater, the Gramercy Theater, New York City.
23640	28160	And maybe my new favorite place, the Gramercy Theater.
28160	38440	Harman Town is now in session.
38440	48440	Let's bring out our Game Masters, Dino Stamatopoulos.
48440	49440	That's ridiculous.
49440	50440	Where do I sit?
50440	51440	Go over there.
51440	52440	Dino has lost his voice.
53440	56440	Dino has lost his voice.
56440	60440	Speaking of people who have lost their voices, let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town,
60440	62440	Mr. Dan Harman.
62440	82440	Holiday, you will be with me.
82440	83440	Shoot.
83440	84440	Shoot.
84440	85440	Pop a block.
85440	86440	Gonna poop a tooth.
86440	87440	Okay.
87440	88440	Here's the thing.
89440	99440	I would like to thank our nine and a half...
99440	100440	You lost your voice too.
100440	104440	Sound engineer, Goliath.
104440	106440	Try talking like this.
106440	112440	Thank you Goliath for doing the sound tonight and making sure that all the microphones are
112440	114440	at the right height.
114440	122440	Who puts a mic that high?
122440	124440	I'm six feet tall.
124440	126440	No you're not.
126440	127440	What?
127440	128440	Are you six feet tall?
128440	129440	What do you think I am?
129440	130440	Like 5'11 and I am.
130440	131440	No.
131440	132440	You're like five...
132440	133440	That's great.
133440	135440	You're like 5'11.
135440	140440	I'm glad I could come to New York and find out who my friends are.
140440	143440	I'm clearly six feet tall and I always have been.
143440	144440	I'm five!
144440	145440	I'm five three!
145440	146440	If anything...
146440	147440	Oh yeah.
147440	148440	All right.
148440	149440	I'm sorry.
149440	150440	All right.
150440	153440	So we have to get some things out of the way.
153440	156440	Let's talk about your absence of voice right now.
156440	159440	You're noticing that my voice is weird.
159440	162440	So here's the thing.
162440	164440	Alcoholism.
170440	171440	Kids, kids.
171440	172440	Thank you.
172440	173440	Don't brag.
173440	175440	It's also karaoke.
175440	182440	Alcoholism, comma, left unchecked.
182440	184440	Leads to karaoke.
184440	188440	Leads to the degradation of the human body.
188440	192440	So you kids, trigger warning.
192440	193440	Don't...
193440	198440	Why am I holding...
198440	200440	You kids, trigger warning.
200440	203440	You're gonna die.
203440	205440	Spoiler alert.
205440	212440	As you die, one of the things that will first start to die is your throat.
212440	214440	I think it was just karaoke a couple nights ago.
214440	218440	Don't underplay the fact that I'm dying.
218440	219440	I'm dying.
219440	222440	I think you're overselling the fact that you just...
222440	224440	A lot of bad karaoke a couple nights ago.
224440	226440	Well, bad karaoke.
226440	227440	No, no.
227440	229440	I sang the studio.
230440	233440	When Harmon does the studio, it's fucking so real.
233440	236440	I make you regret it.
236440	242440	If you put my name in the hat and Phil Collins is involved,
242440	245440	I will make sure that you and Phil Collins
245440	248440	and the ghost of every girlfriend I've ever had,
248440	251440	walk away sad.
251440	256440	I know that I'm too young.
257440	260440	My life has just begun.
266440	268440	Hold it, hold it.
268440	270440	Whoa.
270440	271440	Now.
271440	273440	Thank you.
273440	275440	Give me a chance.
275440	278440	Give me a sign.
278440	279440	It's coming back.
279440	282440	My lyrics are poorly written.
282440	285440	Do you know the worst written song in the world?
285440	286440	What was it?
286440	288440	Pink by Sarah Smith.
288440	290440	Terrible song.
290440	293440	Pink is a collar...
293440	295440	That's what ruined my voice.
295440	296440	Okay, so anyways.
296440	298440	Why is he ignoring me?
298440	299440	No, no, no.
299440	303440	The thing is, you're going to think that Dino is doing a bit right now
303440	304440	speaking in a falsetto.
304440	308440	This is the only level that I could speak in.
308440	311440	Because I ruined the normal part of my voice.
311440	314440	I could talk a little bit like this.
314440	317440	But I think this is cuter.
317440	320440	So he's been doing that and you think, oh, that would get old.
320440	322440	Oh, fucking dang.
322440	325440	I was like, I was mad at people.
325440	328440	I was like, you fucking cunt.
328440	332440	But it does get charismatic after a while.
332440	333440	It's funny.
333440	335440	It's like falsetto.
335440	338440	You nigger.
338440	341440	I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
341440	345440	And you can too, because it's a cartoon voice.
345440	348440	He's like a racist Steamboat Willie.
348440	353440	That's Steamboat Willie already racist.
353440	355440	Okay.
355440	357440	What are you doing?
357440	359440	That was my accident.
359440	361440	Stop making music.
361440	362440	All right.
362440	365440	So I apologize for my throat.
365440	366440	It's...
366440	370440	And I say you're welcome for mine.
370440	373440	There's wear and tear involved.
373440	376440	We have a great show for you tonight.
376440	377440	What I've...
377440	382440	Dan and Deena are going to do some Everly Brothers hits.
382440	384440	They're going to do Unchained Melody.
384440	385440	It's going to be great.
385440	386440	What?
386440	388440	Wake up, little Susie.
388440	390440	What I've done for you tonight,
390440	394440	because you're the greatest city in the world.
394440	398440	And you're not petty people who would ever applaud for that.
399440	401440	Because you're practical people.
401440	403440	You would never be baited like that.
403440	407440	You would never go, yeah, I'm a good city.
407440	410440	That's what makes you a good city.
410440	412440	You can't just call people a city.
412440	414440	These people aren't a city.
414440	416440	These people are the city.
416440	419440	You guys are seeing a very rare occurrence
419440	423440	of the great North American pander bear.
429440	432440	Did you write that?
432440	434440	As far as you know, yeah.
434440	437440	That's good.
437440	439440	The pander bear.
439440	443440	Anyways, obviously you're a good city, obviously.
443440	446440	History has borne that out.
446440	448440	You don't need your dick sucked for that.
448440	449440	Dan, tell these people...
449440	450440	Good job being a city.
450440	452440	Big deal.
452440	453440	I'm New York.
453440	454440	I'm a city.
454440	456440	I'm here forever.
456440	457440	Big deal.
457440	458440	Dan.
458440	459440	But you're good people.
459440	460440	Dan.
460440	462440	Sorry to interrupt you, but tell...
462440	464440	Excuse me for one second.
464440	465440	What the fuck?
465440	467440	I know.
467440	470440	We should tell Boyce to shut up for a second.
470440	471440	Sorry.
471440	472440	Your new nickname is Boyce.
472440	474440	See what?
474440	476440	You got something on your face, too, yeah.
476440	477440	A little green.
477440	478440	Is that good?
478440	479440	Yeah.
479440	480440	You didn't look perfect.
480440	482440	Dan, I know that you love New York City, right?
482440	484440	This was one of your favorite cities in the world, correct?
484440	485440	What?
485440	486440	Yeah.
486440	487440	Well, you...
487440	488440	The top ten.
488440	489440	Okay.
489440	492440	Is it in your top three?
492440	494440	It's my favorite city ever.
494440	495440	Okay.
495440	501440	Tell these people a little history about New York, about how it was founded.
501440	503440	Money!
503440	504440	Well...
504440	512440	Because Dan, when we got really, really drunk last time we were here, Dan went into a blackout.
512440	513440	Stay with me.
513440	515440	Stay with me on this concept.
516440	522440	Dan became a fellow named Anthony, who would tell you how to get around New York City.
522440	527940	And if I ask Dan where his favorite piece of pizza is, or how to get across town, or
527940	534440	how to get to Bushwick during World Show of Traffic, you got lots of advice about it.
534440	535440	Yeah, I'm Anthony.
535440	536440	I'm from New York.
536440	537440	All right.
537440	540440	Now, Anthony, Anthony, before you...
540440	542440	Before you even asked me...
542440	544440	Before you even asked...
544440	548440	I hope your question doesn't involve being below 103rd Street.
548440	549440	Okay.
549440	550440	Well, wait, wait, wait.
550440	553440	Because the truth is, people tell you one thing or another about being in New York.
553440	554440	This guy's spilling Anthony.
554440	555440	Below 103rd Street?
555440	558440	Between A Street and B Street?
558440	564440	That's not New York.
564440	567440	You guys are laughing at a different thing that...
567440	568440	I was laughing at you spilling...
568440	570440	I thought my character was killing me.
570440	572440	I thought I was Billy Crystal.
572440	573440	I didn't know it was a person.
573440	576440	I was laughing at you spilling 9 ounces of vodka.
576440	579440	Anthony, Anthony, I'm...
579440	581440	We're at 23rd and Lexington.
581440	582440	Oh, we shouldn't be.
582440	583440	Tonight.
583440	585440	You don't want to be at 23rd and Lexington.
585440	586440	All right.
586440	587440	But that's where we are.
587440	588440	We got to get up.
588440	589440	We got to get up.
589440	592440	We got to get up above 103rd, or we're not New Yorkers.
592440	593440	Okay.
593440	594440	Wait, wait.
594440	595440	We're below 103rd.
595440	596440	We're not New York.
596440	600440	Don't do New York below 103rd.
600440	601440	That's where your dad lives.
601440	603440	That's where your mom lives.
603440	604440	They're good people.
604440	605440	They built the city.
605440	607440	Are your parents all Dominican?
607440	610440	Look, I don't have...
610440	612440	I don't have parents.
612440	613440	Whoa!
613440	614440	Okay.
614440	615440	Shit.
615440	616440	New York's my parents.
616440	617440	Okay.
617440	623440	My mom was Tower One and my dad was Tower Two.
623440	624440	Just soon enough.
624440	626440	So, just soon...
626440	627440	So don't.
627440	628440	Tony's an orphan.
628440	629440	Don't question me.
629440	631440	So he's the only guy that's allowed to be...
631440	632440	Yeah.
632440	633440	Don't question me.
633440	634440	Anthony.
634440	635440	Anthony, are you Italian?
635440	638440	Anyways, falafel's good.
638440	640440	Above 103rd.
640440	642440	Any fucking argument?
642440	643440	Wait.
643440	645440	Anthony, you just said below 104th is no good.
645440	647440	Below 104th is shit.
647440	648440	Fucking, that's Haiti.
648440	650440	You might as well go to Haiti.
650440	652440	No, not to be racist.
652440	654440	But that's where the Haitians are.
654440	656440	Anthony, are you Italian?
656440	657440	What is your heritage?
657440	658440	Oh, no.
658440	659440	There's no Italy.
659440	660440	There's no Italian.
660440	663440	New York's a country.
663440	665440	New York's a state of being.
665440	667440	Above 104th.
667440	668440	That's who I am.
668440	671440	Now, Anthony, will you go to Little Italy?
671440	673440	What street should I go to?
673440	674440	There's no Little Italy.
674440	675440	There's no such thing as a Little Italy.
675440	679440	There's only little people.
679440	680440	Little Italians.
680440	681440	I think that was actors.
681440	682440	There's Little Italians.
682440	683440	There's no Little Italy.
683440	684440	Italy's big.
684440	685440	Okay.
685440	686440	It's a big deal.
686440	687440	Let's say Chinatown.
687440	688440	Chinatown.
688440	689440	You know what Chinatown is.
689440	690440	China's not a town.
690440	691440	Okay.
691440	693440	That's where you fucked up right there.
693440	694440	See what you did?
694440	695440	You fucked up.
695440	705440	In New York, China is a principality between 104th and A Street.
705440	706440	That's not true.
706440	707440	What?
707440	708440	What?
708440	709440	Motherfucker, no.
709440	710440	You don't know New York.
710440	711440	I'm asking you.
711440	712440	I apologize.
712440	713440	I apologize.
713440	714440	But fuck you.
714440	715440	Are you from the...
715440	716440	My name's Anthony.
716440	717440	I'm from New York.
717440	718440	I've lived here my whole life.
718440	723440	If you go above 104th Street, that's China.
723440	726440	If you go below 103rd Street, that's Haiti.
726440	727440	Okay.
727440	731440	And everything left of A Street, that's Hebrew.
731440	732440	Anthony.
732440	733440	That's good.
733440	734440	That's good.
734440	735440	That's where the good pizza is.
735440	736440	Anthony.
736440	739440	If everyone's speaking Hebrew, that's where you eat the pizza.
739440	740440	Anthony.
740440	741440	What?
741440	742440	Excuse me a second.
742440	743440	What the fuck?
743440	744440	What?
744440	745440	You brought up pizza.
745440	747440	What's your favorite slice of junk?
747440	748440	Hebrew pizza.
748440	751440	You don't even have to interrupt to say that.
751440	753440	What's the secret of Hebrew pizza?
753440	759440	That secret is obviously a covenant between a chosen tribe and a fucking impersonal cosmic
759440	760440	force.
760440	768440	A fucking long suffering people that wandered the fucking desert and were slaves.
768440	769440	Like fucking yeah.
769440	770440	The secret?
770440	772440	What do you think the fucking secret is?
772440	773440	Fucking Jews.
773440	775440	Why does that translate into good pizza?
775440	776440	You fucking eat the pizza.
776440	778440	You eat the pain.
778440	781440	You eat every nugget of it.
781440	782440	It's a fucking...
782440	783440	I love that.
783440	784440	Tony loves Jews.
784440	785440	A Hebrew.
785440	786440	I love...
786440	792440	Look, whatever you guys are saying, you're fucking racist and you're bad people.
792440	798440	Everything below 103rd is racist.
799440	802440	Everything above 104th is misogynist.
802440	803440	Anthony?
803440	806440	Everything to the left of A Street is racist.
806440	807440	Anthony.
807440	809440	So if you go...
809440	816440	If you're below 104th on C Street, that's absolute racism.
816440	819440	That's Nazi Germany.
819440	820440	But they're good people.
820440	822440	They're New Yorkers.
822440	825440	They're Nazis and they're German.
825440	827440	But they're New Yorkers.
827440	830440	And they know how to make a good pizza.
830440	831440	Because they love...
831440	836440	Because they know you got to eat the Hebrew God.
836440	837440	You go to the left.
837440	839440	Am I losing you?
839440	842440	Take the A train down to the L Street.
842440	843440	Go...
843440	844440	Get off.
844440	846440	Get off outside Tony Romano's.
846440	847440	Go up...
847440	848440	My friend.
848440	850440	Go upstairs to the thing.
850440	851440	Everything's vertical.
851440	854440	Go to the bridge.
854440	855440	Keep walking.
855440	856440	Go out the door.
856440	858440	There won't be a bridge there.
858440	859440	Just...
859440	860440	You have to walk.
860440	862440	There's air.
862440	866440	You have to be confident enough to walk.
866440	868440	George Indiana Jones.
868440	869440	No.
869440	870440	It's New York.
870440	872440	You got to walk.
872440	874440	You got to walk on air.
874440	876440	If you're from New York.
876440	880440	If you're not from New York, you'll fall to your death.
880440	885440	If you're 104th up above there, you're walking on air.
885440	897440	Get the best haircut at Sammy Romano's on 23rd and A...
897440	898440	On A?
898440	904440	Best haircut is on A Street and A Avenue.
904440	906440	On the corner of A?
906440	908440	On the corner of A and A?
908440	911440	Welcome to New York, motherfucker.
911440	913440	A Street and A Avenue.
913440	915440	Sorry, Anthony.
915440	917440	What about Brooklyn?
917440	919440	Brooklyn's not New York.
919440	921440	People say...
921440	924440	I'm not going to win any popularity contests.
924440	932440	I'm not here to win a popularity contest.
932440	936440	Brooklyn's not New York.
936440	939440	Brooklyn's Staten Island.
939440	940440	No.
940440	941440	Yeah.
941440	942440	Oh, no.
942440	946440	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
946440	947440	Yeah.
947440	949440	No, you know it.
949440	951440	That's why you reacted that way.
951440	953440	Because you know what I'm saying.
953440	954440	It's true.
954440	958440	Brooklyn is Staten Island.
958440	960440	It's true.
960440	962440	It's a true fact.
962440	967440	I can say it and yell at you and make it true.
967440	970440	Brooklyn is Staten Island.
970440	974440	Manhattan is Brooklyn.
974440	978440	From 1993 to 103rd Street.
978440	980440	Manhattan's Brooklyn.
980440	984440	Queens is Los Feliz.
984440	990440	In Los Angeles, basically all of New York wins to Los Angeles.
990440	995440	After 1995, everybody in Queens wins to Los Angeles.
995440	997440	Queens is a...
997440	1001440	Just get your pizza from a Jew.
1001440	1005440	Their dough is chewy.
1005440	1009440	Because they're scared of God.
1009440	1011440	Who else is scared of God?
1011440	1013440	More than the Jews.
1013440	1014440	They make good pizza.
1014440	1016440	You bite into it and they're like...
1016440	1020440	When they make the pizza, they're like, oh, God, don't kill me.
1020440	1021440	And then you eat the pizza.
1021440	1024440	You're like, oh, God, don't kill me.
1024440	1025440	It's good.
1025440	1028440	And put the pepperoni and the jugadish.
1028440	1029440	The jugadish?
1029440	1030440	With the second.
1030440	1032440	Who makes the best jugadish?
1032440	1033440	Anthony.
1033440	1034440	Anthony.
1034440	1035440	Anthony.
1035440	1036440	Anthony.
1036440	1037440	Oh, Marone.
1037440	1038440	Oh, Marone.
1038440	1039440	Excuse me for a second.
1039440	1040440	What the fuck?
1040440	1041440	What the fuck?
1041440	1043440	I was going to ask you, who makes the best jugadish in time?
1043440	1046440	I was going to say, with the jugadish, you go to 103rd.
1046440	1048440	You go to Sally's.
1048440	1053440	You go to Sally's between P Street and 4th B Street.
1053440	1054440	The 4th B Street.
1054440	1057440	There's four B Streets in Manhattan.
1057440	1058440	The first is in Staten Island.
1058440	1061440	Don't go there.
1061440	1063440	The third B Street?
1063440	1064440	That's Queens.
1064440	1066440	That's New York.
1066440	1069440	I think you said Queens was Staten Island.
1069440	1072440	No, it was Queens and Houston.
1072440	1073440	That's New York.
1073440	1074440	Now, as far as I know...
1074440	1076440	That's the epicenter of New York.
1076440	1077440	As far as I heard...
1077440	1079440	That's where the Statue of Liberty is.
1079440	1082440	It's where it used to be.
1082440	1083440	That's New York.
1083440	1086440	I don't think you're from New York at all.
1086440	1089440	I lived here for 100 million 9-11s.
1089440	1093440	I lived here for a million 9-11s.
1093440	1097440	I lived here since 9-10, you piece of shit.
1097440	1098440	You pussy.
1098440	1103440	You fucking Los Angeles fucking white collar piece of shit.
1103440	1106440	I lived here since 9-10.
1106440	1110440	Where did you live?
1111440	1113440	Probably below 103rd.
1113440	1114440	I think you lost it.
1114440	1118440	What did you connect you with 104th Street?
1118440	1119440	Why 104th Street?
1119440	1122440	You have a weird context with 103rd.
1122440	1125440	Everybody below 103rd can go fuck themselves.
1125440	1127440	But that's most of the city.
1127440	1131440	The bit's old.
1131440	1133440	Am I right or am I wrong?
1133440	1134440	The bit's old.
1134440	1136440	You got your Staten Island bit.
1136440	1138440	You got your Brooklyn bit.
1138440	1139440	You keep doing the same bit.
1139440	1141440	If I do the bit, then what am I?
1141440	1144440	One of my queens?
1144440	1145440	What am I, Brooklyn?
1145440	1147440	Anthony, what do you do for a living?
1147440	1148440	I do the bit.
1148440	1149440	What do you do for a living?
1149440	1150440	The bit is old.
1150440	1153440	How do you say obviously I work for SpaceX?
1153440	1155440	I work for Elon Musk.
1155440	1157440	That's obvious, obviously.
1157440	1158440	That's more interesting.
1158440	1162440	No, I weld spaceship holes.
1162440	1163440	Really?
1163440	1167440	I cold rivet, you fucking racist.
1167440	1169440	I wasn't racist.
1169440	1171440	I tell you what I do.
1171440	1173440	I'll tell you everything you do.
1173440	1175440	I do it above 103rd.
1175440	1176440	I fuck it.
1176440	1179440	I do whatever you ask.
1179440	1185440	Did something bad happen to you below 103rd?
1185440	1188440	Nothing could ever happen to anybody below 103rd.
1188440	1191440	I already said the bit.
1191440	1193440	I have a joke.
1193440	1196440	Didn't I already say the bit was done?
1196440	1201440	I think his dad touched him below 103rd.
1201440	1202440	All right.
1202440	1203440	Well, yeah.
1203440	1206440	So the bit's over.
1206440	1209440	I killed it.
1209440	1212440	My name's Anthony.
1212440	1215440	I'm from New York.
1215440	1217440	It's a classic character.
1217440	1223440	I'm like the church lady or the broccoli guy.
1223440	1225440	I'm Anthony and I love New York.
1225440	1226440	All right.
1226440	1227440	Anyways.
1227440	1229440	How's your voice, Dan?
1229440	1230440	It's great.
1230440	1234440	That voice is the best for that character, actually.
1234440	1238440	I took these guys to do karaoke and their voices are fucked.
1238440	1241440	Tonight, let's all do karaoke so I can lose my voice, too.
1241440	1245440	Shall we?
1245440	1249440	You're cheering for just random things.
1249440	1252440	Okay.
1252440	1260440	Now you're cheering for you cheering for cheering for cheering.
1260440	1261440	Okay.
1261440	1262440	Wait a minute.
1262440	1263440	Wait a minute.
1263440	1264440	Okay.
1264440	1268440	Now you're cheering for cheering for cheering for cheering.
1268440	1269440	What the fuck?
1269440	1270440	You guys.
1270440	1275440	It's like your whole city's got a heart.
1275440	1276440	All right.
1276440	1278440	So this is my real voice.
1278440	1281440	This is what I sound like.
1281440	1285440	So Dino came up with the solution of talking in falsetto.
1285440	1287440	So that's what I do.
1287440	1292440	Because if your throat is shredded, if you talk in falsetto, it's not.
1292440	1294440	Well, you don't want two guys doing that.
1294440	1295440	No.
1295440	1298440	But Dino's been talking in falsetto for 24 hours.
1298440	1300440	It's a fucking nightmare.
1300440	1302440	I can't get laid.
1302440	1304440	It becomes funny.
1304440	1309440	Dino, last night we talked about the fact that you had procured a threesome for yourself.
1309440	1311440	That's right.
1311440	1318440	But you are going to be the master, the dominant person in this threesome?
1318440	1319440	Yeah.
1319440	1320440	I'm going to be dominant.
1320440	1321440	Okay.
1321440	1325440	Well, aren't you normally like the bottom of the threesome?
1325440	1327440	Well, I mean, it depends.
1327440	1328440	So normally you're a slave.
1328440	1332440	Sometimes I don't have the patience to be submissive.
1332440	1334440	But tomorrow you have a threesome happening, right?
1334440	1335440	I've got a threesome happening.
1335440	1337440	And you're going to be the slave or the master?
1337440	1340440	No, I'm going to be the master.
1340440	1343440	How can you be the master with this voice?
1343440	1345440	How do you tell two women?
1345440	1347440	Hey, you tell me.
1347440	1349440	It's a nightmare.
1349440	1350440	You go over there.
1350440	1351440	How does it work?
1351440	1355440	Two women are going to come to your hotel room, or are you going to their place?
1355440	1356440	Yeah.
1356440	1358440	No, they're going to come to my hotel room.
1358440	1359440	They're going to come to the hotel room.
1359440	1361440	And when they walk in, you're going to go,
1361440	1362440	Hi, I'm Dino.
1362440	1363440	Hello.
1363440	1364440	Well, yeah.
1364440	1365440	Take your pants off.
1366440	1368440	It's going to be quite surprising.
1368440	1369440	For one of them.
1369440	1371440	I think one of them is here tonight, actually.
1372440	1373440	Wait, for real?
1373440	1375440	Yeah, but she doesn't want to be known.
1375440	1376440	Okay.
1376440	1378440	Let's pick a fake name for her.
1378440	1379440	Let's call her...
1379440	1380440	Cinnamon?
1380440	1381440	Cinnamon.
1382440	1383440	So Cinnamon...
1383440	1384440	That was actually just...
1384440	1385440	Does she...
1385440	1387440	Does Cinnamon know the other girl?
1387440	1388440	Yeah.
1388440	1389440	She does?
1389440	1390440	Yeah, I don't think she likes her.
1391440	1393440	But that's going to make it better.
1396440	1400440	So, you're going to be the master of speaking like Mickey Mouse the whole time.
1400440	1401440	I know.
1401440	1403440	It's not the perfect scenario.
1403440	1405440	Yeah, it's not, yeah.
1405440	1409440	Are you going to tell Cinnamon to do things to the other girl?
1409440	1410440	Oh, yeah.
1413440	1418440	Well, what could we impose and ask for some foreshadowing?
1418440	1423440	What you would sound like while in falsetto telling Cinnamon what to do?
1423440	1426440	I mean, I think you've been hearing it and it was like, you know, just...
1427440	1430440	Whip! Whip Cinnamon!
1431440	1433440	I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.
1433440	1436440	You want Cinnamon to be whipped by the other girl?
1436440	1437440	Yeah.
1437440	1438440	Okay.
1438440	1440440	Do you bring your own whips?
1440440	1442440	No, Cinnamon's bringing the whips.
1442440	1443440	Cinnamon brings her...
1443440	1444440	She brings her own whips.
1444440	1445440	I bought her a whip.
1445440	1447440	You bought her a whip.
1447440	1448440	And she's going to bring it.
1448440	1450440	She's going to get it whipped by it.
1450440	1452440	It's the ultimate humiliation.
1453440	1455440	What if she doesn't bring the whip?
1455440	1458440	So she will, won't you?
1460440	1461440	You...
1462440	1463440	You cunt!
1464440	1465440	See? No.
1467440	1472440	Dina, when there's a threesome happening where you're the master and people are whipping each other,
1472440	1478440	are you, like, are you fucking them or is this all about masturbating after the fact?
1478440	1480440	Well, it depends.
1481440	1485440	Sometimes I might be fucking one of them while the other one's being whipped.
1485440	1487440	People think you're doing a bit.
1487440	1488440	No, it's not a bit.
1488440	1491440	The only thing funny about this is my voice, really.
1494440	1497440	You know, I believe it's erotic.
1497440	1501440	Draw the best case scenario for tomorrow night.
1501440	1502440	I don't want to.
1502440	1504440	I don't want to ruin it for me.
1505440	1507440	I don't want to, like, just tell them what's going on.
1507440	1508440	Can I try?
1508440	1509440	Yeah.
1510440	1511440	Okay, so...
1511440	1512440	You could try whatever you want.
1512440	1513440	If I had two women...
1513440	1515440	You go to 103rd Street.
1516440	1520440	Two women that agreed to be at a threesome with me.
1520440	1521440	Yeah, with me.
1521440	1523440	Okay, so, and then I'm...
1524440	1526440	Dan, are you being Dina or are you being yourself?
1526440	1530440	No, I'm trying to think through what would you actually ask for.
1530440	1531440	Huh?
1531440	1533440	What would you actually ask for?
1533440	1534440	Pick your...
1534440	1538440	Do your favorite threesome where you have two girls...
1538440	1541440	That one hates the other girl coming to your hotel.
1541440	1542440	No, I'm not.
1542440	1543440	I don't want to.
1543440	1545440	Okay, all right, so forget the hatred.
1545440	1547440	Two girls are coming to your place tonight.
1547440	1549440	You're a recently single gentleman.
1549440	1551440	You've got the money.
1551440	1553440	You've got the wherewithal.
1554440	1556440	You're staying at a nice hotel.
1556440	1559440	You're staying at the Bowery Room 503, everybody.
1560440	1565440	In this fantasy scenario, you're saying you have, like, white privilege?
1566440	1573440	Well, Dan, suspend your own disbelief and imagine you have white privilege.
1573440	1575440	Just for the sake of this bit.
1575440	1577440	White privilege?
1579440	1588440	I guess I run all business and control people's thought by marginalizing their opinions.
1588440	1589440	Dan.
1589440	1592440	Oh, sorry, sorry, sexually. Okay, okay, sorry.
1592440	1594440	I got lost for a second crazy scenario.
1594440	1598440	You are a person two women that you are attracted to are coming to your place.
1598440	1601440	Both of these people, these two women, do not know each other.
1601440	1603440	Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. How are they attracted?
1603440	1604440	So, Dan...
1604440	1605440	I want to think...
1605440	1606440	Set the scene. Set the scene.
1606440	1607440	Set the scene.
1607440	1608440	Act one.
1608440	1610440	Fade in on what we fade in on this fantasy.
1610440	1612440	I want to answer this honestly, I do.
1612440	1613440	Fade in.
1613440	1617440	And believe me, as you probably can already tell, I'm not going to try to win any popularity contests.
1618440	1620440	Like, I want to actually answer this honestly.
1620440	1621440	What would I do?
1621440	1624440	By the way, this whole scene takes place south of 100...
1624440	1630440	In the interest of equal time, after I answer this question, I want to bring one female up
1630440	1633440	and I want her to answer, what would you do with two dudes?
1633440	1636440	Just anybody that has big... Do you think that's fair?
1636440	1642440	I think we should bring up so many women on stage that we have the world's worst five-semin of all time.
1642440	1646440	By the way, it might be hard to believe, but I would be with two dudes.
1647440	1652440	Dina, would you rather be with two women tonight or two guys or a combination of their own?
1652440	1654440	Well, it depends on who they were.
1654440	1655440	Yeah?
1655440	1656440	Yeah.
1656440	1657440	So it could be two guys.
1657440	1658440	It could be two guys.
1658440	1662440	Now, if it was two guys, do you want to be master or do you want to be slave when two guys come over?
1662440	1663440	I'm not sure.
1663440	1664440	For real?
1664440	1665440	I really am not sure.
1665440	1668440	I mean, I didn't have to meet them, we'd have to talk.
1668440	1669440	Not too much.
1669440	1675440	Why don't we just use the show as an American Idol and we just keep bringing men and women on stage
1676440	1678440	until Dina evaporates.
1679440	1681440	So did we interrupt something?
1681440	1682440	Were you going to start something?
1682440	1683440	All right.
1683440	1687440	So Dan Harmon... We fade in on Dan Harmon Threesome.
1687440	1690440	We take you to the Bowery Hotel, room 503.
1690440	1692440	First of all, what are you wearing?
1694440	1696440	What am I wearing?
1697440	1700440	Dina, are you wearing your fish and underwear?
1700440	1701440	I'm not.
1701440	1704440	Dina passed out last time in New York with his pants around his waist
1704440	1707440	and he had a high concept fish and underwear on.
1707440	1708440	Stop, stop.
1709440	1710440	Are you wearing those?
1710440	1711440	No, I'm not wearing them tonight.
1711440	1712440	No?
1712440	1713440	No.
1713440	1714440	Okay.
1714440	1715440	We fade in on Dan Harmon's Threesome.
1715440	1717440	Can we lower the lights?
1718440	1719440	Perfect.
1726440	1728440	Can we do one drop spot on Dan Harmon?
1728440	1730440	Can we just drop spot?
1730440	1731440	Okay, okay.
1737440	1738440	He looks good.
1739440	1742440	I knew a man Bojangles and he danced for it.
1744440	1746440	Oh, that's nice.
1747440	1749440	Okay, I'm trying.
1749440	1754440	First of all, my first answer, my first answer is I'm so insecure sexually
1754440	1757440	that I can't, I honestly, like the idea of a threesome, I can't.
1757440	1761440	I'd be like, oh, that's, I'm outnumbered by the people that would judge me.
1761440	1763440	Like I can't, that's my first answer.
1763440	1764440	Fade in.
1765440	1766440	Page one, page one, fade in.
1766440	1768440	But I'm trying to get beyond that.
1771440	1776440	All right, yeah, you promised us, Dan, you promised last night that you would verify
1776440	1780440	whether or not the girl you jerked off to in the commercial was of age or not.
1780440	1785440	Well, I looked her up and then I got distracted and I fell asleep.
1785440	1786440	All right, Dan.
1786440	1787440	Tomorrow night.
1787440	1788440	Tomorrow night.
1789440	1793440	Page one, fade in on you or somebody else.
1793440	1794440	What's the fade in?
1795440	1797440	I want to be honest.
1797440	1800440	I want to do this right, but I don't.
1800440	1801440	Just leave her alone.
1802440	1803440	Let me do it.
1803440	1805440	Are you saying, do you know, are you saying Dan's to chicken shit?
1805440	1806440	If I can make this right?
1806440	1810440	No, I'm saying that you're pushing him too hard.
1810440	1811440	Well, let me think.
1811440	1813440	Give him some time.
1813440	1814440	Page one.
1814440	1815440	Let me think.
1815440	1816440	I'm trying to think.
1816440	1817440	Take your time.
1818440	1820440	I mean, I love you, Jeff, but you're pushing him.
1820440	1821440	I love you.
1821440	1822440	I love you, Deena.
1823440	1824440	I'm going to fuck you so hard.
1824440	1825440	Okay.
1826440	1829440	Actually, Jeff and I are going to fuck behind him right now.
1830440	1832440	My perfect threesome.
1833440	1834440	By Dan Harmon.
1838440	1839440	There's a woman.
1841440	1842440	Yeah, I went there.
1843440	1844440	It's a good start.
1847440	1850440	And she.
1852440	1853440	I want to get this right.
1861440	1863440	She's she works.
1863440	1864440	She works.
1866440	1869440	She works at a library for sure.
1869440	1872440	She's like, I guess you call her a librarian.
1875440	1877440	So that's how the story starts.
1878440	1880440	I walk into a library.
1881440	1886440	And I say, I'm not smart.
1889440	1891440	And she has glasses.
1893440	1894440	Red hair.
1896440	1897440	Blouse.
1898440	1899440	Like.
1900440	1902440	Well, Batgirl, don't don't yell stuff out, sir.
1903440	1904440	It's not the kind of show.
1905440	1906440	Okay, it's Batgirl.
1906440	1907440	You're right.
1908440	1909440	It's Batgirl.
1909440	1910440	It's Batgirl.
1911440	1912440	But really good.
1912440	1914440	So Batgirl works at the library.
1914440	1915440	Barbara Gordon.
1916440	1922440	But but Barbara Gordon in a world where like mesh tops are in style.
1923440	1925440	But not slutty.
1925440	1927440	Like like like the shoulders.
1928440	1931440	Do you know those tops that are like nylon on the shoulders?
1932440	1933440	But then those like tasteful.
1933440	1934440	It's tasteful.
1938440	1939440	I don't know if that's a library.
1939440	1940440	It doesn't matter.
1940440	1941440	This is my world.
1942440	1945440	But it's like I want you guys to understand this tasteful.
1946440	1949440	Like this is not a person that's to be disrespected.
1950440	1953440	This is a person with a lot of power and agency.
1954440	1956440	I'm not saying that to impress you.
1956440	1958440	It's what I jerk off to.
1959440	1960440	I want.
1960440	1961440	I want.
1961440	1962440	I jerk off to women with agency.
1966440	1967440	Thank you.
1968440	1969440	You're welcome.
1971440	1973440	Dan, remember, this is leading towards you.
1973440	1975440	This is leading towards your threesome.
1976440	1977440	No, Jeff, please.
1978440	1980440	I'm in the middle of something.
1981440	1985440	I really know this is a fantasy because Dan said she's not.
1985440	1987440	She he's not smarter than her.
1988440	1989440	You know, she's smarter than me.
1989440	1990440	Yeah.
1991440	1992440	Yeah.
1992440	1993440	You know, she's smarter than me.
1993440	1995440	Yeah, that's that's what makes it a fantasy.
1996440	1997440	That's.
2001440	2002440	But also, I want to do it.
2002440	2005440	We're not we're not going into a world where I'm trying to impress you.
2005440	2006440	So.
2007440	2008440	I'm not bullying him.
2009440	2010440	You guys can do whatever you want.
2010440	2011440	So you walk in.
2011440	2013440	So we have we have some we have some guests tonight.
2013440	2014440	We should probably bring up.
2019440	2022440	And the guests play one of the girls.
2022440	2023440	Yes.
2023440	2024440	Yes.
2024440	2025440	Yes.
2025440	2026440	Yes.
2026440	2027440	Yes.
2027440	2028440	OK.
2028440	2029440	Yes.
2029440	2030440	Let's welcome Scott.
2030440	2031440	Scott adds it to the stage.
2039440	2040440	You know, him
2042440	2044440	as Pete Hornberger on 30 Rock.
2045440	2046440	So Dan,
2047440	2049440	music is still playing a Scott playing girl,
2049440	2051440	Batgirl, but librarian number one.
2051440	2053440	Or do you hear any last second girl that comes into the scene?
2053440	2055440	Can you do a long form?
2056440	2058440	Grounded, grounded,
2059440	2061440	grounded, long form improv.
2061440	2063440	Can you be a redhead?
2064440	2065440	The spectacle.
2066440	2067440	Mesh top.
2068440	2069440	Librarian.
2070440	2071440	Beautiful woman.
2071440	2072440	She's read it.
2072440	2073440	Yeah.
2074440	2075440	OK, yeah.
2076440	2077440	All right.
2082440	2084440	So let's fade back in.
2084440	2086440	Now we know that she's Redhead.
2086440	2088440	Scott is Redhead Batgirl librarian.
2088440	2089440	OK.
2090440	2091440	So I'm coming in.
2091440	2092440	I'm already here.
2092440	2093440	OK.
2093440	2094440	Yeah.
2094440	2095440	You're a librarian.
2095440	2096440	It's a librarian.
2096440	2097440	Yeah.
2097440	2098440	You've been there since 9 a.m.
2110440	2111440	OK.
2111440	2112440	I'm coming in.
2117440	2118440	Hello.
2118440	2119440	Hi.
2120440	2122440	I'm Anna Girth.
2124440	2125440	I'm sorry.
2127440	2130440	I didn't understand what you said.
2131440	2133440	My name is Anna Girth.
2133440	2136440	Your name is Anna Girth?
2137440	2139440	It's just one word, Anna Girth.
2144440	2146440	That's your first name.
2154440	2155440	OK.
2156440	2157440	Hello.
2157440	2159440	Do you like what I'm wearing?
2159440	2160440	I do.
2160440	2161440	I think it's tasteful.
2161440	2162440	I do.
2164440	2165440	I do.
2165440	2166440	I love it.
2167440	2169440	What would you like me to call you?
2170440	2171440	Daniel.
2171440	2172440	Daniel?
2172440	2173440	I like that.
2173440	2174440	It's sexy.
2175440	2176440	It's Hebrew.
2180440	2181440	That's what I said.
2184440	2189440	I brought a book back.
2194440	2196440	And it's late.
2200440	2202440	I brought a book back and it's late.
2206440	2207440	Oh.
2208440	2209440	It's very late.
2209440	2210440	It's very late.
2212440	2213440	It's really late.
2215440	2217440	I know I'm smiling, but I feel bad.
2217440	2221440	The library closes in five minutes.
2221440	2223440	Five minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
2223440	2224440	Five minutes.
2224440	2225440	Keep it tasteful.
2228440	2232440	Well, I guess you need some kind of reprimand.
2233440	2234440	Well, I...
2237440	2238440	Are you...
2239440	2240440	consulting me?
2241440	2243440	Are you asking me or telling me?
2244440	2245440	I'm telling you.
2245440	2247440	That I need a reprimand?
2247440	2248440	Really?
2248440	2249440	For real?
2250440	2251440	From you?
2252440	2253440	Well...
2255440	2258440	I'm not going to argue with you.
2260440	2261440	I...
2262440	2263440	Oh, are you hitting me?
2263440	2264440	No, you're hitting me.
2265440	2266440	Are you hitting me?
2266440	2267440	Are you hitting me with a...
2267440	2269440	My library closes in one minute.
2269440	2270440	One minute.
2270440	2271440	I don't...
2271440	2272440	By the way, I don't like that.
2272440	2273440	You're very...
2274440	2276440	Alright, so that's not the scenario you like...
2276440	2277440	No, it's not.
2277440	2278440	...when you're being punished.
2278440	2279440	No.
2279440	2280440	No, I don't want to be hit.
2280440	2281440	So I need to find some other punishment.
2281440	2283440	No, I got hit by people that were...
2293440	2294440	Okay.
2294440	2296440	I'm starting to understand.
2298440	2300440	It's a shade of things.
2300440	2301440	It's... we're going...
2301440	2302440	Okay.
2302440	2303440	So it's not...
2303440	2304440	It's about what I don't want.
2304440	2305440	Is that the idea?
2305440	2307440	I'm gonna girth.
2307440	2309440	What are you doing here?
2310440	2311440	Who's this?
2313440	2315440	I'm the library closer.
2317440	2319440	She's my superior.
2320440	2322440	She works beneath me.
2328440	2329440	And when I say she works beneath me,
2329440	2331440	I mean she works on top of me.
2331440	2334440	We don't like to think of it as work, though.
2335440	2336440	You guys both...
2336440	2338440	Are you Hebrew?
2338440	2339440	My name...
2339440	2340440	My name is Hebrew.
2340440	2341440	We're gonna...
2341440	2344440	Five minutes later, back at a hotel room.
2344440	2345440	What?
2345440	2346440	Alright.
2346440	2347440	Fine.
2347440	2348440	Fine.
2349440	2350440	But that's a turn off.
2350440	2352440	Somebody's co-opting a narrative.
2352440	2353440	That's a turn off.
2353440	2354440	It's a big time jump.
2354440	2355440	We're now in the middle of...
2355440	2356440	That's a turn off.
2356440	2357440	Can we rewind?
2357440	2358440	Can we rewind?
2358440	2359440	No, no.
2359440	2360440	We're in the hotel room now.
2360440	2362440	This is some time later and we're in the middle of the scene.
2362440	2363440	Ready?
2363440	2364440	Here we go.
2364440	2365440	I'm gonna girth.
2365440	2367440	I can't believe we got to the hotel in five minutes.
2367440	2369440	That was Saturday night.
2369440	2371440	That was light traffic.
2372440	2374440	Don't ruin the fantasy.
2374440	2375440	I know.
2375440	2377440	Now, I'm gonna girth.
2377440	2380440	Daniel's in the bathroom right now.
2381440	2384440	Should we work up a number two or a number six?
2384440	2388440	What's the scenario you want to do?
2388440	2391440	I don't think his heart could take a number six.
2391440	2392440	Really?
2392440	2393440	He's...
2393440	2394440	I mean...
2394440	2397440	He looks like an old prospector.
2405440	2407440	What's your suggestion then?
2407440	2411440	I say we go easy when we make him feel loved.
2411440	2412440	I mean, I don't...
2412440	2413440	Make him feel loved.
2413440	2414440	I tried punishing him.
2414440	2415440	He didn't like it.
2415440	2420440	I think what he's looking for is someone to actually respect him and love him.
2420440	2422440	I'm gonna go outside the hotel room.
2422440	2424440	I'll knock when you're ready.
2424440	2425440	Okay.
2443440	2453440	Ladies, I'm here.
2461440	2462440	I was waiting for you.
2462440	2465440	I made a poo-poo.
2465440	2468440	I can't believe that.
2468440	2472440	I can tell that you can smell it.
2473440	2477440	It's one of the most manly musks I've ever smelled.
2477440	2482440	I know that you don't mean that.
2482440	2488440	So, you seem very lovable and sweet.
2488440	2491440	It just seems like you're lying.
2491440	2493440	You seem intelligent and successful.
2493440	2497440	Okay, that sounds honest.
2497440	2498440	You seem...
2498440	2499440	Oh.
2499440	2502440	Recently divorced.
2502440	2503440	Ding dong.
2503440	2504440	Oh.
2504440	2505440	Sorry.
2505440	2510440	That's the hotel doorbell.
2510440	2512440	Hello.
2512440	2513440	I'm from NBC.
2513440	2516440	You're hired.
2516440	2520440	I'm a sexy redhead and you're hired at NBC.
2520440	2524440	Well, that's not my fantasy either.
2524440	2528440	I don't like being whipped or being hired by NBC.
2528440	2530440	You guys think that you know it.
2530440	2531440	Oh, I'm sorry.
2531440	2532440	I have the wrong room.
2532440	2533440	Yeah.
2533440	2536440	You have my apartment.
2536440	2537440	Okay, so...
2537440	2540440	You know, Dan, you're topping from the bottom right now.
2540440	2543440	What the fuck?
2543440	2546440	Well, isn't that my job?
2546440	2547440	No.
2547440	2549440	You should just be like...
2549440	2552440	I mean, you know, are you me or are you you?
2552440	2553440	I'm me.
2553440	2554440	Oh.
2554440	2555440	Ding dong.
2555440	2556440	Ding dong.
2556440	2557440	Ding dong.
2557440	2558440	Who's that?
2558440	2559440	Hello.
2559440	2560440	Who was that?
2560440	2561440	Hello.
2561440	2566440	I am a girl that you can you can endow me with any property she wants.
2566440	2569440	Oh, you're made of fiberglass.
2569440	2574440	I'm a...
2574440	2580440	Oh, you turn into Kim Cottrell when no one's looking.
2580440	2581440	Yeah.
2581440	2582440	Yeah.
2582440	2585440	And I'm Andrew McCarthy.
2585440	2588440	But there's no threesome.
2588440	2590440	I'm so insecure.
2590440	2591440	No.
2591440	2592440	Okay.
2592440	2593440	Fantasy is just...
2593440	2594440	Daniel.
2594440	2595440	Hebrew Daniel.
2595440	2596440	Yeah.
2596440	2597440	There's no reason to be insecure.
2597440	2598440	This is your fantasy.
2598440	2599440	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
2599440	2600440	You get to do whatever you want.
2600440	2601440	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
2601440	2603440	To Scott Asett and Jeff Davis right now.
2603440	2605440	Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
2605440	2606440	Okay.
2606440	2607440	Okay.
2607440	2608440	Okay.
2608440	2609440	Okay.
2609440	2610440	Okay.
2610440	2611440	Okay.
2611440	2612440	Okay.
2612440	2613440	Okay.
2613440	2614440	Okay.
2614440	2615440	Okay.
2615440	2616440	Okay.
2616440	2617440	Okay.
2617440	2618440	Okay, okay, okay.
2618440	2619440	But I don't know...
2619440	2622040	Well, I don't know who she is.
2622040	2628060	I've seen you in the Wendy's commercials.
2628060	2631860	I'm the redhead from...
2631860	2632860	The...
2632860	2635160	McDonald's commercials.
2635160	2636160	She played at the time.
2636160	2638860	I'm the aerobic instructor from Night Rider.
2638860	2639860	Okay.
2639860	2641860	The Time Warner.
2641860	2643100	Time Warner.
2643100	2644100	It's your fantasy, Dan.
2644100	2645100	Okay, all right.
2645100	2646100	This is your fantasy.
2646100	2647100	She's very young.
2648100	2649100	You're the...
2649100	2650100	Get Wendy's.
2650100	2651100	Wendy's girl.
2651100	2652100	Yeah.
2652100	2653100	And you're the Time Warner girl.
2653100	2655100	I'm Time Warner?
2655100	2656100	Yes.
2656100	2657100	Okay.
2657100	2661900	So let's now cut to the middle of the action.
2661900	2671660	So I guess...
2671660	2673820	I guess I'm really doing this for my daughter.
2673820	2677220	She has autism, and I just can't afford it with a regular job.
2677220	2683220	I work at the library, and that just doesn't pay enough.
2683220	2687220	The bills are paying up, and I've got two ex-husbands.
2687220	2691220	They take it all away from me.
2691220	2694220	I'm gonna die alone.
2694220	2696220	I'm gonna die alone.
2696220	2699220	You're really wasting my Time Warner down here.
2699220	2703020	I'm gonna die alone.
2703220	2708220	I'm purposely miming my dick bigger than it is.
2708220	2710220	It's so small.
2710220	2711220	I'm gonna die alone.
2711220	2712220	Dan.
2712220	2713220	Dan.
2713220	2714220	This is your fantasy.
2714220	2715220	All right, all right, all right.
2715220	2716220	You can do whatever you want.
2716220	2717220	Right.
2717220	2718220	Whoa, yeah.
2718220	2719220	Get specific-er.
2719220	2720220	Okay.
2721220	2722220	All right.
2722220	2723220	Um...
2723220	2724220	Minecraft it.
2726220	2731220	Both of you are interested in Minecraft.
2733220	2734220	Oh, my God.
2734220	2738220	Is that a weird cube in front of you?
2738220	2741220	Walk up to it and see if that book opens,
2741220	2743220	or if it closes when you walk away from it.
2743220	2744220	It does all of the above.
2744220	2746220	Why does the book open?
2746220	2747220	Because I'm smart.
2747220	2749220	But what's in the book?
2749220	2752220	Do you have an inventory of all the things in the book?
2752220	2753220	Oh, my God.
2753220	2756220	I'm gonna score it all over your face.
2758220	2761220	Do you like Minecraft?
2761420	2763420	I didn't hear you say it.
2765420	2766420	I'm a librarian.
2766420	2768420	I don't know anything about Minecraft.
2768420	2770420	Ten minutes later, it's me and...
2770420	2771420	What's your name?
2771420	2772420	Amandagirth?
2772420	2773420	Uh, Anagirth.
2773420	2774420	Anagirth.
2774420	2776420	She and I are in the...
2776420	2777420	Padregrin knows.
2778420	2781420	I don't think this guy knows what fantasies mean.
2784420	2786420	We offered him anything he chose,
2786420	2789420	and he wants us to watch him play video games.
2789620	2791620	He has no imagination.
2791620	2792620	I know.
2792620	2793620	And you think it's weird.
2793620	2795620	He's a creator of TV shows.
2795620	2796620	What did he create?
2796620	2798620	Some cancelled show on NBC.
2798620	2799620	I don't know.
2799620	2800620	Oh.
2800620	2803620	But the thing is, he's got lots of money.
2803620	2805620	He could do anything he wanted right now.
2805620	2810620	I think our services are being wasted on this guy.
2810620	2811620	Well, you must have a fantasy.
2811620	2813620	Why don't we just spend it on him?
2813620	2814620	Five minutes later.
2815620	2818620	You guys...
2818620	2820620	You guys dick big shits?
2823620	2824620	Ooh.
2824620	2826620	Judd Apatow.
2826620	2827620	Ooh.
2827620	2829620	And scene.
2829620	2831620	What's up?
2831620	2833620	Scott Anzit.
2836620	2839620	That's called ImprovOlympic Trains.
2839620	2841620	I wanna...
2841620	2846620	Thank you, guys, from saving me from a night of a horrible threesome.
2846620	2847620	Never gonna have a threesome.
2847620	2849620	Yeah, don't have a threesome.
2849620	2852620	Well, because, honestly, we'll talk about this for one second,
2852620	2862620	because everybody in the audience fantasizes about polyamorous adventures.
2862620	2863620	Yeah.
2863620	2866620	And, like, there's no...
2866620	2868620	Can I just say this is like a fantasy?
2868620	2871620	This is like Grover talking to Daniel Tiger.
2873620	2876620	Tell us things that make us happy,
2876620	2879620	because most of the people here tonight are like,
2879620	2884620	yeah, I think about the idea of, like, a double harmonica.
2888620	2891620	On my wiener, like, two ladies going like,
2891620	2893620	it's like a harmonica.
2895620	2897620	I can't even figure out which of us are we...
2897620	2900620	Should we suck it, or are we kissing?
2900620	2901620	Ladies, I don't know.
2901620	2902620	Dan?
2902620	2904620	Enjoy your confusion.
2904620	2905620	Harmon.
2905620	2906620	What are you doing down there?
2906620	2909620	Oh, they're so quixotic.
2909620	2912620	Dan, have you ever had a threesome in?
2912620	2913620	No, no, no.
2913620	2914620	Never?
2914620	2915620	I haven't, no.
2915620	2917620	It sounds like you've never had a blow job.
2923620	2926620	Have you ever had a twosome?
2928620	2931620	But what I hear from people who have had threesomes...
2931620	2932620	They're kind of a nightmare.
2932620	2934620	They're high maintenance.
2934620	2939620	Yeah, well, I mean, really, all you need is one human being
2939620	2943620	in your vagina or on your dick.
2943620	2945620	Really, that's all you need.
2945620	2946620	Right.
2946620	2949620	And yet, you've set one up for this trip.
2949620	2951620	Well, yeah, because you just...
2951620	2952620	What did you throw off me?
2952620	2953620	A piece of you.
2954620	2957620	Scott, have you ever had a threesome?
2957620	2958620	I've not.
2958620	2959620	Never?
2959620	2960620	No.
2960620	2963620	It's difficult because, you know, there's egos involved a lot,
2963620	2964620	you know?
2964620	2965620	Yeah, definitely.
2965620	2966620	You're primates.
2966620	2967620	You're not supposed to.
2967620	2968620	Yeah.
2968620	2969620	You're not supposed to, right?
2969620	2971620	Somebody's usually, like, jealous or something.
2971620	2972620	Not me.
2972620	2975620	I mean, the women just fuck each other and I go to sleep.
2975620	2981620	I've once been woken up with laughter because I was snoring
2981620	2982620	during a threesome.
2983620	2986620	I swear to God.
2986620	2987620	Yeah.
2987620	2989620	You've ordered the three-way for this trip just so you can get to the
2989620	2990620	system.
2990620	2991620	They're kind of boring.
2991620	2992620	They're kind of boring.
2992620	2996620	So everyone that's terrified of having a threesome is technically a hero.
2996620	2998620	Well, yeah, no, I don't think so.
2998620	2999620	I think they're...
2999620	3000620	Okay, well, that's what I heard.
3000620	3001620	That's what I heard.
3001620	3003620	Jeff, have you had a threesome?
3003620	3004620	Uh, many.
3004620	3005620	All right, come on.
3005620	3008620	Every one of his threesomes are going to be amazing.
3008620	3009620	But it was a nightmare, right?
3009620	3010620	Huh?
3010620	3011620	No, fuck.
3011620	3012620	He's got...
3012620	3015620	He never tells a bad story about himself, by the way.
3015620	3016620	Ever.
3016620	3019620	Fucking pisses me off.
3019620	3020620	Oh, shit.
3020620	3021620	God damn it.
3021620	3022620	All right.
3022620	3023620	I will say...
3023620	3024620	We once...
3024620	3025620	Sorry, I'm sorry.
3025620	3028620	...wound the room and told shitty stories about ourselves.
3028620	3032620	And Jeff told a shitty story that I didn't.
3032620	3033620	Oh, wait.
3033620	3034620	No.
3034620	3036620	Everyone ended up loving me.
3036620	3037620	That's not true.
3037620	3039620	That is exactly true.
3039620	3043620	I had two bad threesomes where...
3043620	3044620	Can I...
3044620	3045620	Oh, wait.
3045620	3046620	Can we still tell you alcohol?
3046620	3047620	No, no, no.
3047620	3048620	No, we can't.
3048620	3049620	Can I do...
3049620	3050620	Can I...
3050620	3051620	Before you tell your story...
3051620	3052620	Okay.
3052620	3055620	Can I do my impression of what I predict your threesome story would be?
3055620	3056620	Oh, my God.
3056620	3058620	It's going to be really...
3058620	3059620	Based on...
3059620	3066620	Based on what Jeff Davis' stories are, I believe that your story will go something like this.
3066620	3068620	Scott, get ready to fill in as...
3068620	3071620	He was at a place...
3071620	3074620	And I was just hanging out.
3074620	3078620	And I was reading Moby Dick.
3078620	3081620	So far, you're right on target.
3081620	3086620	I was just reading it because I think it's interesting.
3086620	3088620	I wasn't reading it because it's a classic.
3088620	3092620	I didn't even know what a classic is.
3092620	3097620	And the first of two women came up to me and said...
3097620	3098620	What are you doing?
3098620	3100620	What are you doing?
3100620	3103620	And I said, I'm reading Moby Dick.
3103620	3105620	And she said...
3105620	3107620	Thank you.
3107620	3109620	So...
3109620	3113620	Thank you.
3113620	3117620	And then her sister came up.
3117620	3120620	I said, what's going on?
3120620	3123620	And she said, this guy is reading Moby Dick.
3123620	3124620	And she's like, why?
3124620	3126620	And I explained Moby Dick to her.
3126620	3129620	And when I finished, she went...
3129620	3131620	Thank you.
3131620	3135620	And then we went back.
3135620	3136620	I'm sorry.
3136620	3143620	I was spilling it anyway.
3143620	3147620	Blood magic.
3147620	3153620	There isn't a show after us tonight.
3153620	3159620	And then we had sex, and then they both said, thank you.
3159620	3162620	What was your story?
3162620	3165620	Well, now he's going to lie.
3165620	3170620	In a threesome, Dina, you've had more threesomes than I've had for certain.
3170620	3173620	You're a purveyor of weird threesomes.
3173620	3175620	Yeah, I'm very insecure.
3175620	3178620	Usually there's somebody that says, let's have a threesome.
3178620	3183620	And that person is the one that gets bummed out at the end of it.
3183620	3186620	Because they didn't get all the attention they wanted.
3186620	3189620	And I was like, you can just be there.
3189620	3195620	I didn't want anything out of this except you got bummed out during this threesome.
3195620	3196620	Right?
3196620	3199620	Yeah, it's usually one of the women.
3199620	3203620	Yeah, because they outnumber you two to one, statistically.
3203620	3204620	Well, yeah.
3204620	3207620	I already gave up from the beginning.
3207620	3209620	I'm like, I'm just going to stick this one out.
3209620	3212620	By the way, is there anybody, because it's New York, who knows?
3212620	3216620	Is there anybody that's had an awesome threesome that also wants to talk about it?
3216620	3217620	With Jeff.
3217620	3219620	I see a hand.
3219620	3221620	Who here had a threesome with me?
3221620	3223620	Well, I see a guy pointing at his friend.
3223620	3225620	Which means that you were...
3225620	3228620	Can I get a bearded guy with a wristband on him?
3228620	3230620	Do you want to talk about it?
3230620	3232620	Your friend wants you to talk about it.
3232620	3233620	Do you want to talk about it?
3233620	3234620	He's got a good beard.
3234620	3236620	Let's bring him up.
3236620	3238620	Also, Jane's raising her hand.
3238620	3240620	We'll get to you, Jane.
3242620	3245620	Yeah, I guess it feels...
3248620	3249620	What do you think?
3249620	3251620	There's your mic.
3251620	3252620	Hello.
3252620	3254620	What's your name, sir?
3254620	3256620	Hi, I'm Arshon.
3256620	3257620	Arshon?
3257620	3258620	Arshon.
3258620	3259620	Arshon.
3259620	3260620	Yeah.
3260620	3262620	You got a nice ass.
3262620	3263620	Arshon.
3263620	3265620	How many threesomes have you had, Arshon?
3266620	3267620	Two?
3267620	3268620	Two.
3268620	3269620	Yeah.
3269620	3270620	How many were successful out of those two?
3270620	3271620	One or neither?
3271620	3272620	They were both successful.
3272620	3273620	They were?
3273620	3274620	Yeah.
3274620	3277620	Nobody got bummed out during the middle of it?
3277620	3278620	No.
3278620	3279620	No one got bummed out.
3279620	3281620	What's your secret, Arshon?
3281620	3283620	What's the secret to successful threesomes?
3283620	3284620	A liar.
3284620	3287620	That's not nice.
3287620	3288620	Somebody calls him a liar.
3288620	3289620	You're not lying, sir.
3289620	3290620	He's a liar.
3290620	3291620	That's not nice.
3291620	3293620	I've had a girlfriend for eight years,
3293620	3296620	and we are an open relationship.
3296620	3297620	The whole time?
3297620	3300620	We have an open relationship.
3300620	3303620	So there's girls and guys and...
3303620	3304620	Coming in and out.
3304620	3305620	Yeah.
3305620	3306620	Coming in hot.
3306620	3309620	Now, Arshon, are you into only women,
3309620	3310620	or are you bi?
3310620	3316620	So our openness is only with other girls.
3316620	3317620	Only women?
3317620	3318620	Yeah.
3318620	3320620	You selfish piece of shit.
3320620	3323620	If you're going to be open-minded,
3323620	3328620	that's the best I know you're open-minded to be.
3328620	3329620	All right.
3329620	3330620	So I'm going to make the rules.
3330620	3332620	Arshon, take us to the best...
3332620	3334620	Let's homo fashion.
3334620	3337620	Pick the best threesome of the two,
3337620	3340620	and walk us through the origin.
3340620	3341620	From top to bottom.
3341620	3342620	Yeah.
3342620	3345620	Starting at Sizzler, all the way through.
3345620	3347620	The best of the two.
3347620	3354620	So my girlfriend had met the other girl
3354620	3358620	on a dating app, Tinder, and...
3358620	3359620	Not cliche.
3359620	3360620	Dating app.
3360620	3363620	So she was like, hey, let's...
3363620	3364620	It was her...
3364620	3366620	So she's dating you, but she's also on a dating app?
3366620	3367620	Yeah.
3367620	3369620	We both are on all of them.
3369620	3370620	That's how good you are in bed.
3370620	3372620	She's online.
3372620	3375620	Or I can't say I'm good in bed,
3375620	3376620	but she's...
3376620	3377620	Yeah.
3377620	3378620	Okay.
3378620	3379620	Yeah.
3379620	3380620	I'm really good in bed.
3380620	3381620	Yeah.
3381620	3382620	That's exactly why.
3382620	3384620	I think he would be.
3384620	3387620	I don't need you to be.
3387620	3390620	If you're bad, I don't think you're a bad person.
3390620	3392620	Dan, if I put a red...
3392620	3396620	I assume you have a larger penis than me.
3396620	3398620	Dan, if I put a red wig on him on the right side...
3398620	3399620	Because of the fingerless gloves.
3399620	3404620	No one with a dick my size would ever wear fingerless gloves.
3404620	3405620	Fingerless gloves?
3405620	3408620	As they go, like, well, what am I trying to prove?
3408620	3409620	The fingerless gloves.
3409620	3411620	I'd be like, no, let's just keep my fingers warm.
3411620	3414620	Are you a very successful safe cracker?
3414620	3418620	What's going on with it?
3418620	3421620	What's about to happen with these fingerless gloves?
3421620	3425620	My hand's just about to stay warmer, but I can crack a safe VD one.
3425620	3426620	Right.
3426620	3427620	Or...
3427620	3428620	I got you.
3428620	3433620	So, the girlfriend says, Arshan, ring a ding ding.
3433620	3434620	Tinder called.
3434620	3435620	Yeah.
3435620	3436620	So...
3436620	3445620	By the way, this guy bothered to come up here and is, like, vulnerable, so don't tease him.
3445620	3446620	So, asshole.
3446620	3455620	A lot of text messages happen intermediately, but she has the same dog that we have, so
3455620	3457620	it's just dog walking trip, and then...
3457620	3458620	Yeah.
3458620	3460620	Wait, what do you mean, yeah?
3460620	3461620	So, yeah.
3461620	3462620	Wait.
3462620	3463620	We asked you...
3463620	3464620	What?
3464620	3465620	I don't know.
3465620	3466620	I fucked two women.
3466620	3468620	I don't know.
3468620	3469620	We asked you about a threesome.
3469620	3471620	I was not a great V. It was Thanksgiving.
3471620	3472620	Take us to the moment.
3472620	3473620	And then two women fucked me.
3473620	3474620	No!
3474620	3476620	Tell us the story!
3476620	3479620	You're a terrible person.
3479620	3482620	Everyone that was bullying him...
3482620	3483620	That's what I said!
3483620	3484620	Bullying him.
3484620	3485620	Okay, okay.
3485620	3486620	Hang on.
3486620	3487620	Arshan.
3487620	3488620	Scott.
3488620	3489620	Someone...
3489620	3490620	Hey, someone hold my drink.
3490620	3491620	Hold up.
3491620	3492620	Hold up, Arshan.
3492620	3493620	Arshan.
3493620	3496620	Stay right where you are.
3496620	3497620	Scott.
3497620	3498620	Since what?
3498620	3499620	Scott, you...
3499620	3502620	Look at what he's doing.
3502620	3507620	Scott getting another threesome story.
3507620	3511620	Scott, you're a professional improviser.
3511620	3514620	I think we should just recreate that threesome.
3514620	3518620	With all of Arshan's information, let's turn this right now.
3518620	3519620	Perfect.
3519620	3520620	Okay.
3520620	3521620	Give us more.
3521620	3522620	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3522620	3527620	Okay, so I've been with my girlfriend for eight years.
3527620	3535620	I moved to New York City from Maryland seven years ago.
3535620	3537620	I grew up in Potomac.
3537620	3540620	They just started a real hospitalized Potomac this season.
3540620	3543620	But that's not important.
3543620	3544620	Arshan, sit down.
3544620	3545620	We have enough information.
3545620	3546620	Oh, come on.
3546620	3547620	What are you doing?
3547620	3548620	So I moved up here.
3548620	3550620	No, let him tell us.
3550620	3555620	And then the first girlfriend I got, she went to NYU.
3555620	3557620	She's very smart.
3557620	3560620	You have to be to go to that school.
3560620	3561620	Right?
3561620	3565620	We dated for seven years.
3565620	3568620	Share your face with the audience.
3568620	3569620	Good.
3569620	3570620	We grew apart.
3570620	3571620	We grew apart.
3571620	3576620	And then once we grew apart, we got back together.
3576620	3582620	And then it basically all became about just having fun.
3582620	3584620	And what does fun mean?
3584620	3587620	Fun means we date other people.
3587620	3590620	So fun is not being with each other.
3590620	3591620	Yeah.
3591620	3596620	Or we now take it to Arshan's threesome.
3596620	3597620	I want to hear the story.
3597620	3598620	I want to hear more.
3598620	3600620	Don't heckle him.
3600620	3602620	He's volunteering information.
3602620	3604620	So he might sing.
3604620	3605620	Look at him.
3605620	3606620	I'm like Seinfeld.
3606620	3609620	When Kramer was racist and Seinfeld was like, stop laughing.
3609620	3610620	Can we get Arshan?
3610620	3611620	It's not funny.
3611620	3614620	Can we get Arshan off the other gloves?
3614620	3619620	Can we get Arshan a special light?
3619620	3622620	Perfect.
3622620	3623620	So they met on Tinder.
3623620	3629620	And they got along really well.
3629620	3633620	They were nice to each other.
3633620	3637620	My girlfriend, she had just colored her hair red.
3637620	3642620	The girl she was with, her hair was actually red.
3642620	3647620	She was a redhead.
3647620	3649620	She was like, hey, so when are you coming home tonight?
3649620	3653620	I was like, I'll be home like 12, maybe 12, 15.
3653620	3655620	Because, OK, that's fine.
3655620	3657620	If you come a little later, it's cool.
3657620	3659620	I'll be with her.
3659620	3661620	Let's just say her name is Quarter.
3661620	3663620	Quarter?
3663620	3664620	I'm sorry, what?
3664620	3666620	What is her name?
3666620	3668620	Go back to that part.
3668620	3669620	Do you say Quarter?
3669620	3672620	Use other delineations of change.
3672620	3674620	Quarter.
3674620	3675620	Dime.
3675620	3678620	Do I say you're protecting the time from defamation?
3678620	3680620	So you're saying her name is Penny,
3680620	3681620	but you're going to call her Quarter.
3681620	3682620	Scott.
3682620	3684620	OK, OK, OK.
3684620	3686620	The names have been changed.
3686620	3688620	I was like, that's cool.
3688620	3692620	I was like, could you just call her Kennedy Head instead?
3692620	3694620	Kennedy Head.
3694620	3697620	Yes, that's fine.
3697620	3699620	I'll be home a little bit later.
3699620	3703620	So I was out gallivanting with Ryan, who's over there.
3704620	3711620	Then I get home and, oh, so you and Penny are friends.
3711620	3714620	Come on, no, come on, come on.
3714620	3716620	I'm protecting him.
3716620	3718620	He's volunteering information.
3718620	3719620	I'm sorry.
3719620	3721620	So I...
3721620	3722620	Stop, no, stop it.
3722620	3723620	I'm sorry.
3723620	3724620	Stop heckling.
3724620	3726620	But that's my whole story.
3726620	3729620	So I walk into the apartment and they're having fun.
3729620	3730620	What does fun mean?
3730620	3731620	Joined in.
3732620	3733620	So their fun is being together.
3733620	3736620	Your fun is not being with your girlfriend.
3736620	3737620	That's not what I said.
3737620	3741620	That was my first introduction into this moment.
3741620	3743620	So the two of them were having fun.
3743620	3746620	And then I come in and they're like, hey, join in.
3746620	3747620	Fun's over.
3747620	3748620	Oh, OK.
3748620	3749620	OK, all right.
3749620	3752620	So your girlfriend's name?
3752620	3753620	Emily.
3753620	3754620	Emily.
3754620	3755620	And the other girl?
3755620	3756620	Penny.
3756620	3757620	Quarter.
3757620	3758620	Penny?
3758620	3759620	Penny.
3759620	3760620	Emily and Penny.
3761620	3762620	What was your name?
3762620	3763620	Arshon.
3763620	3764620	Arshon.
3764620	3765620	Respect him.
3765620	3769620	We asked for a sexual person and he came up and volunteered it.
3772620	3774620	It's not that impressive of a story,
3774620	3777620	but I feel like they shouldn't be that impressive
3777620	3779620	because threesomes should be normal.
3779620	3781620	What year is this?
3781620	3782620	How many...
3782620	3783620	All right.
3783620	3784620	Am I going to get beat up?
3784620	3785620	Arshon.
3785620	3787620	Why was it awkward?
3787620	3789620	I think it should happen all the time.
3789620	3790620	It was this year.
3790620	3791620	It was this year.
3791620	3792620	It was this year.
3792620	3793620	It was this year.
3793620	3794620	All right.
3794620	3796620	We now take you to Arshon's first or second person.
3796620	3797620	Thank you, Arshon.
3797620	3800620	Thank you very much for your vulnerability and your honesty.
3800620	3801620	Thank you.
3801620	3803620	Who wants to play the role of Arshon right now?
3803620	3805620	I will be Arshon.
3805620	3807620	Scott Adson will play the role of Arshon.
3807620	3810620	And that means Dan and Dino.
3810620	3813620	I should not be in this.
3813620	3816620	I definitely think you should be in this.
3816620	3819620	Dan will play Emily and Dino will play Penny.
3819620	3821620	I wasn't listening.
3821620	3822620	Okay.
3822620	3824620	We hadn't actually got to your part yet.
3824620	3825620	I was so fucking bored.
3825620	3828620	Dino, it was all preamble.
3828620	3830620	There was no story yet.
3832620	3833620	It's 9-11.
3833620	3835620	Thank you, New York.
3839620	3840620	Fade in.
3840620	3841620	Fade in.

3879620	3880620	We both saw it.
3880620	3881620	Totally fake.
3881620	3883620	Scott Adson and I both said that was fake.
3883620	3885620	Ten minutes later.
3885620	3886620	Ten minutes later.
3890620	3891620	That's real.
3891620	3892620	That's real.
3892620	3893620	That's real.
3894620	3896620	I wasn't listening to the story.
3896620	3897620	Penny.
3898620	3901620	Penny, I know you're taking a shit.
3901620	3904620	I feel bad about you falling down just now.
3904620	3906620	Five minutes ago.
3908620	3910620	My boyfriend, Arshon, is coming over.
3910620	3911620	What?
3911620	3914620	Yes, I'm dating an Armenian.
3917620	3919620	Even my best friends don't know that.
3919620	3923620	But I'm telling you, Penny, that I'm dating an Armenian.
3924620	3925620	What are you talking about?
3925620	3927620	I'm not an improviser.
3929620	3930620	Penny.
3930620	3931620	Penny, it's okay.
3931620	3932620	Be in the moment.
3932620	3933620	Say yes and.
3933620	3934620	That's all that matters.
3934620	3938620	Because we're going to have a threesome soon.
3938620	3941620	I don't care that you weren't listening during Arshon's monologue.
3941620	3943620	It doesn't matter.
3943620	3945620	Yeah, you're not allowed to.
3945620	3946620	I'm sorry.
3946620	3947620	I'm God.
3949620	3950620	Oh, Penny.
3950620	3952620	Cock-a-doodle-doo.
3954620	3957620	Ignorance isn't an excuse.
3958620	3960620	Penny, the Lord has spoken.
3960620	3961620	The Lord has spoken.
3961620	3963620	My Armenian boyfriend's coming over.
3963620	3964620	Okay.
3964620	3965620	He might be Syrian.
3965620	3966620	I don't fucking know.
3966620	3967620	Okay.
3967620	3968620	Dino.
3968620	3969620	What?
3969620	3970620	This is the devil.
3970620	3971620	Fuck this scene up.
3973620	3976620	Dino, don't listen to the devil.
3976620	3977620	Say yes and.
3977620	3980620	And don't ask questions and set the where.
3980620	3982620	Dino, Dino, this is God.
3982620	3984620	You're not in a scene.
3984620	3986620	If you are, it's a bad scene.
3988620	3991620	Dino, this is Emily.
3991620	3992620	Stay in the moment.
3992620	3995620	Why are you calling me my name, but you're a character?
3995620	3996620	You're Penny.
3996620	3998620	I'm only using this because you don't know where the fuck we are.
3998620	3999620	He said Dino.
3999620	4000620	Emily, I meant.
4000620	4001620	Dino.
4001620	4002620	You're fucking Penny.
4002620	4004620	Dino, you can win this scene.
4006620	4007620	Dino.
4009620	4010620	What?
4010620	4014620	You can win this scene if you get the audience on your side and not on Jeff's.
4015620	4017620	Dino, this is God.
4017620	4018620	Hello.
4018620	4020620	You can't win a scene.
4020620	4022620	The only winner.
4022620	4023620	Dino.
4023620	4024620	Dino.
4026620	4027620	Okay.
4027620	4028620	Okay.
4028620	4029620	Mission accomplished.
4029620	4031620	Mission accomplished.
4031620	4032620	Mission accomplished.
4037620	4039620	Dino, you have done well, my students.
4040620	4042620	I agree.
4043620	4044620	I agree.
4044620	4046620	Is it two hours yet?
4046620	4048620	God and the devil are.
4048620	4050620	I don't know how to improvise.
4050620	4051620	Penny.
4051620	4052620	Penny.
4052620	4053620	Penny.
4053620	4054620	My boyfriend Arshon's coming over in five minutes.
4054620	4055620	Really?
4055620	4056620	I thought that was the ender.
4056620	4058620	Dino, this is God.
4058620	4060620	You can't control.
4060620	4061620	Lights down.
4061620	4065620	Penny, I'm going to leave you alone for a moment while you have your own eternal mom of mine.
4065620	4067620	You guys have to improvise as a nightmare.
4068620	4070620	It's the worst job ever.
4073620	4074620	I love me too.
4074620	4076620	That's why I want out of here.

4196620	4197620	I'll play a one.
4197620	4198620	I'll play one.
4198620	4199620	Where's it?
4199620	4200620	I brought you a package.
4200620	4201620	Okay.
4201620	4203620	Did you set this up at all or is it just a package as a.
4203620	4204620	Okay.

4273620	4275620	Sometimes I think threesomes are bad.
4276620	4277620	I love Penny.
4278620	4280620	I'm your female roommate, Emily.
4280620	4281620	Freeze.

4292620	4293620	Oh, new choice.
4293620	4294620	I don't know that one.
4294620	4295620	Just tag me.
4295620	4297620	My boyfriend is coming in.
4297620	4298620	His name is Arshon.
4298620	4299620	He's Armenian.
4299620	4300620	New choice.
4300620	4302620	My friend is Assyrian.
4302620	4303620	Right.
4303620	4306620	He's all eyebrows and no cock.
4308620	4310620	Some stereotypes are true.
4313620	4316620	When he gets here, I want to be.
4316620	4319620	I want me to be the bottom.
4319620	4321620	I want you to be the top.
4321620	4324620	And I want him to be the peanut butter in that sandwich.
4324620	4325620	Okay.
4325620	4326620	Okay.
4326620	4327620	Okay.
4327620	4328620	You know what I'm talking about.
4328620	4329620	Dino's going to become a certain kind of character.
4329620	4331620	Like a cowboy or a pirate.
4331620	4333620	So what kind of character.
4333620	4335620	What kind of character should Dino be?
4337620	4338620	Anybody.
4338620	4339620	Anybody.
4339620	4340620	What?
4340620	4341620	What is it?
4341620	4342620	Obsessive compulsive.
4342620	4343620	I can't do it.
4343620	4344620	I can't do it.
4345620	4347620	Obsessive compulsive.
4347620	4348620	Obsessive compulsive.
4348620	4349620	Go.
4352620	4355620	I say Arshon should be the peanut butter in a sandwich.
4355620	4357620	What do you think?
4357620	4358620	Hold on.
4358620	4362620	I got to turn the lights on and off about a thousand times.
4362620	4363620	Freeze!
4363620	4367620	Now Jeff is going to continue this in a different style.
4367620	4370620	Like a western or a pirate movie.
4370620	4371620	So what is...
4371620	4373620	How is Jeff going to do the scene now?
4375620	4376620	What?
4376620	4383620	I heard improv scene.
4383620	4384620	Improv scene.
4384620	4385620	Improv scene.
4385620	4386620	Improv scene.
4389620	4390620	No you shouldn't.
4390620	4391620	Freeze!
4393620	4394620	Okay.
4394620	4395620	Well we need no...
4395620	4396620	Freeze.

4403620	4404620	Your favorite actor.
4405620	4406620	Liam Neeson.
4406620	4407620	Liam Neeson.
4407620	4409620	No we go with the first suggestion.
4409620	4412620	I heard Liam Neeson.
4412620	4415620	Liam Neeson is not running the improv scene.
4415620	4416620	Liam Neeson.
4417620	4420620	This is Liam Neeson playing an improv caller.
4421620	4423620	Okay so this is what's going to happen.
4427620	4428620	Okay.
4428620	4430620	What we need is a last line.
4430620	4431620	Freeze.
4431620	4432620	Freeze.

4435620	4436620	Victorian.
4436620	4440620	Call an improv scene in the Victorian era.
4440620	4441620	In the Victorian era.
4443620	4444620	What we're going to do now.
4446620	4447620	Right away.
4448620	4453620	Is we're going to get one last suggestion which is a last line of dialogue.
4453620	4459620	What wraps up the whole scene and keeps everybody on their cobblers.
4460620	4462620	So what's the last line of dialogue?
4464620	4465620	I heard...
4466620	4467620	Look out!
4468620	4470620	That's the last line or first line?
4470620	4472620	That's the last line of dialogue my cheeky.
4473620	4474620	What's what?
4475620	4476620	Oh!
4476620	4477620	Look out!
4477620	4478620	Arshon.
4478620	4479620	I'm here with Penny my friend.
4479620	4480620	She's in the bathroom right now.
4480620	4482620	We're going to have the world's worst threesome.
4483620	4484620	Who's we?
4484620	4485620	You and me Arshon.
4485620	4486620	You're Arshon now.
4486620	4487620	And her?
4487620	4489620	Yeah Penny is in the bathroom.
4489620	4490620	Follow me.
4490620	4492620	You know I'm Armenian.
4493620	4494620	I don't deserve this.
4496620	4497620	Racially.
4497620	4498620	Racially.
4498620	4499620	I don't deserve this.
4499620	4500620	Freeze!
4501620	4503620	I'm going to respond with something even more racist.
4505620	4507620	Who can think of something even more racist?
4507620	4508620	Nigger!
4508620	4509620	Nigger!
4509620	4510620	Nigger!
4510620	4511620	Nigger!
4511620	4512620	Nigger!
4512620	4513620	Nigger!
4513620	4514620	And scene.
4514620	4515620	Scene everybody.
4515620	4516620	Thank you so much.
4517620	4518620	Yeah.
4519620	4520620	Alright.
4520620	4521620	You see.
4522620	4523620	Improv isn't hard.
4524620	4525620	Improv is easy.
4525620	4528620	All you have to do is be a racist.
4529620	4535620	Let's bring up Transgender Change!
4542620	4544620	You all ready to open your mind?
4547620	4549620	You all thought you knew what gender was?
4549620	4550620	You're wrong.
4552620	4555620	Transgender Change!
4560620	4564620	This motherfucker doesn't give a shit about gender!
4566620	4569620	I think you probably do give a lot of shits about gender.
4570620	4571620	Dignity.
4572620	4575620	I bring some dignity to the stage.
4576620	4577620	Good luck.
4577620	4578620	I hope.
4580620	4581620	What were we talking about tonight?
4582620	4583620	We said so many things.
4583620	4586620	I've cried eight times while talking to you over the last two days.
4587620	4590620	One of the reasons I cried is because...
4591620	4595620	By the way, we are doing a downshift right now.
4595620	4597620	No, don't call it yet.
4597620	4599620	We're going on a hike here, Jane.
4599620	4601620	No, no.
4601620	4603620	This is the funniest section.
4603620	4605620	You downshift and you're going uphill.
4605620	4607620	Raise your expectations.
4608620	4609620	Raise them.
4610620	4613620	When a transgender person comes up and you talk about transgender,
4613620	4615620	you should raise your expectations.
4615620	4616620	Don't lower them.
4617620	4618620	Raise them.
4619620	4623620	This better be the funniest part of the show.
4623620	4625620	And if it's not, Dan...
4625620	4627620	No, maybe we need to re-examine.
4627620	4628620	We never...
4629620	4630620	What we tolerate.
4632620	4633620	We never have...
4633620	4634620	I think we should talk about...
4634620	4635620	I don't know.
4636620	4640620	Let's talk about the tolerance for white cis males.
4645620	4647620	Jane, you guys have been running hard.
4650620	4652620	Is one or more of your sons here tonight?
4653620	4655620	Is one of your kids here tonight or no?
4655620	4656620	No, no. No children here tonight.
4657620	4660620	Jane, threesomes. Have you had one or more?
4660620	4663620	No children here, but they both listened to the broadcast.
4664620	4666620	Have you had a threesome, Jane?
4666620	4669620	I have had a threesome and a foursome in my life.
4669620	4671620	Now, we have a winner.
4671620	4672620	A foursome?
4673620	4675620	Jane, were they all with yourself?
4677620	4678620	A foursome?
4678620	4679620	Fuck you!
4682620	4683620	Jane, the foursome...
4683620	4684620	You answer the question.
4685620	4688620	How do you know when you're having a foursome?
4688620	4690620	What was the line-up in the foursome?
4690620	4691620	How do you know it's over?
4692620	4695620	What was the ratio of male-female presenters and whatnot?
4696620	4698620	Oh God, that's complicated.
4698620	4701620	Yeah, that's my point.
4701620	4705620	What's the difference between a foursome and just a weird night at a hotel?
4707620	4708620	All of the others were...
4708620	4712620	The Henderson's came over for Christmas and it was a foursome.
4712620	4719620	That foursome, who were they in terms of gender specificity and what was the setup to that?
4719620	4726620	Let's see, we had me, a genetic male presenting female, this is pre-hormone.
4727620	4733620	We had three then genetic females, two of whom are sort of...
4733620	4736620	Two were bisexual, one was non-bisexual.
4736620	4742620	Where they exactly sit in terms of gender preference and presentation.
4742620	4747620	Two of them enjoyed doing drag kings, so they certainly had sort of that sort of aspect.
4747620	4748620	Drag kings!
4748620	4749620	Drag kings!
4749620	4750620	That's the thing, I love that.
4750620	4756620	Oh my God, as drag kings, that's women who do parody male presentation.
4756620	4758620	Yeah, it's the first time I ever heard of it.
4758620	4762620	Yeah, they weren't dragging at the time that we were doing this, but it was just this level of complexity.
4762620	4763620	Who's that guy?
4763620	4765620	Oh, he's a beer provider.
4765620	4770620	No, but it's just one of the things that we talked about a lot.
4770620	4776620	What you're describing is Oprah's primordial soup of sexuality.
4776620	4783620	Well, it was a situation where four people really enjoyed each other and it really didn't matter what parts they brought to the game.
4783620	4789620	And so four people doing it, right?
4789620	4791620	I think that happened at some point.
4791620	4792620	Not like that.
4792620	4793620	It doesn't look like that.
4793620	4795620	But yeah, there were some...
4795620	4797620	Shaking parts, yes.
4801620	4803620	Was the foursome a successful event?
4803620	4805620	Did everybody get what they wanted?
4805620	4807620	Was it a good affair or bad?
4807620	4808620	It was wonderful.
4808620	4813620	It was beautiful and spiritual and it was fabulous.
4813620	4817620	You always have to one-up me, don't you?
4817620	4819620	Sorry.
4819620	4821620	Do you ever...
4821620	4826620	Dan, pick your foursome.
4826620	4827620	Who is it?
4827620	4828620	Cast your foursome.
4828620	4830620	I couldn't even cast your own foursome.
4830620	4839620	Okay, Karen Gillam from Dr. Who is just there, but she's not involved.
4839620	4841620	She's directing.
4841620	4846620	She's wearing jot purse and like a hat that says director.
4846620	4850620	If she takes off her clothes, she'll gain too much status.
4850620	4851620	So she's there.
4851620	4856620	She's watching through a glass booth.
4856620	4862620	I'm...
4862620	4865620	I love that guy.
4865620	4866620	That guy's like...
4866620	4867620	He's like, fuck it.
4867620	4871620	I want Karen Gillam to watch me fuck.
4871620	4872620	She's behind glass.
4872620	4873620	It's bulletproof.
4873620	4874620	Dan, for real.
4874620	4877620	Be it for real.
4877620	4882620	Oh, let's get behind the facade of the guy who gets fired in those five weeks.
4882620	4885620	I want to know what turns you on in a foursome.
4885620	4886620	I'm telling you.
4886620	4887620	Yeah, but you're fumpfering.
4887620	4888620	I want to hit the gas.
4888620	4889620	I'm trying to figure it out.
4889620	4890620	I'm trying to figure it out.
4890620	4891620	I'm fumpfering.
4891620	4892620	What did you say?
4892620	4893620	Pick three people.
4893620	4894620	What did you...
4894620	4895620	I'm sorry.
4895620	4896620	I'm sorry.
4896620	4897620	I'm sorry.
4897620	4898620	Pick three people.
4898620	4901620	That guy is a fascist.
4901620	4903620	Guess what?
4903620	4906620	I don't have to pick three people.
4906620	4907620	Pick...
4907620	4908620	No.
4908620	4909620	No.
4909620	4910620	No.
4910620	4911620	Okay.
4911620	4913620	You don't buy it for me.
4913620	4914620	You're right to not buy that.
4914620	4915620	Pick three genders.
4915620	4916620	Lightning round.
4916620	4917620	Three genders?
4917620	4918620	Three genders?
4918620	4919620	You betcha.
4919620	4920620	You only get three genders.
4920620	4921620	Pick three genders.
4921620	4922620	Pick three genders.
4922620	4924620	Who doesn't have only three genders, though?
4924620	4926620	He can pick among three genders.
4926620	4929620	They could be all one, or they could be all three.
4929620	4930620	Or agendered.
4930620	4933620	But don't corner yourself out of this.
4933620	4940620	I will say, I want to bring this to a respectable place because you guys are being bad people.
4941620	4944620	So I want to be vulnerable and tell you, I had a dream recently.
4944620	4954620	In my dream, like, I had a very vivid sexual dream where my ex-girlfriend, ex-ex, like,
4954620	4961620	previous relationship, I walked into a party and she was splayed out on a couch.
4961620	4965620	And there were, like, people, like, she was very sexy.
4965620	4974620	And in the dream, I was very, I was just turned on by, I was just watching her get,
4974620	4983620	like, sexed with by guys that were, like, you know, Ryan Gosling.
4983620	4988620	Like, they did sit-ups ever.
4988620	4991620	And she was like, I'm so happy you've done sit-ups.
4991620	4995620	But she wasn't like, oh, your dick's so much bigger than Dan Harmon's.
4995620	4998620	Like, she was, like, happy to see me.
4998620	5005620	And I was happy to see her, but I was also happy to see her plowed by, like, bucks.
5005620	5007620	Were you chatting friendly?
5007620	5009620	I was, like, watching and jerking off.
5009620	5012620	And then, yeah!
5012620	5014620	And then I woke up.
5014620	5016620	So I don't know where I would have gone.
5016620	5020620	But I wanted to volunteer that because I wanted this show to be a place where people are vulnerable.
5020620	5022620	Thank you, sir.
5022620	5025620	I want this to be a place where people are vulnerable.
5025620	5032620	Dan, in that dream, cast three guys that you want to see that, whatever the ex-girlfriend is,
5032620	5037620	who are the three people that you want to see your ex-girlfriend in that dream before?
5037620	5039620	Well, I don't, the guys would be, I mean...
5039620	5040620	You said Ryan Gosling.
5040620	5042620	Yeah, but I just, that's my placeholder.
5042620	5045620	But I'm saying now, pick, like...
5045620	5048620	I don't want a particular guy to fuck.
5048620	5051620	It's not about the specificity of that guy.
5051620	5054620	That's what I'm saying, though, guys are mannequins.
5054620	5060620	But now I'm asking you to be specific.
5060620	5063620	I don't want that guy.
5063620	5066620	I'm saying now, I'm Satan.
5066620	5067620	I'm saying pick the guy.
5067620	5069620	I don't pick the guy.
5069620	5071620	I know you want it to be you and you're fine.
5071620	5072620	You can do it.
5072620	5073620	You can do it.
5073620	5075620	No, I want it to be Antonio Banderas.
5075620	5079620	No, you can fuck Sarah Johnson.
5079620	5083620	All right, let's say that you are, it's Rosemary's baby.
5083620	5086620	You're Rosemary.
5086620	5089620	Can I just say, Jane, you are one of the best guests we've ever had on the show.
5089620	5091620	Thank you.
5091620	5094620	Jane, okay, I want to say this so fast.
5094620	5100620	Jane, let's say you had a dream where Dan was watching his girlfriend be fucked by other people.
5100620	5104620	Who would you cast as the three guys that fucked Dan's ex-girlfriend?
5105620	5107620	You're casting director, Jane.
5107620	5113620	Okay, so keeping in mind that I'm a little older and not the father of three.
5113620	5115620	Okay, two.
5115620	5118620	Cast the people fucking Dan's ex-girlfriend in his dream.
5118620	5119620	Gene Kelly.
5119620	5121620	Gene Kelly.
5127620	5129620	I like it, I like it.
5129620	5132620	Along that line, Donald O'Connor.
5133620	5134620	He's funny.
5134620	5135620	Donald O'Connor.
5135620	5136620	It's funnier than Gene.
5136620	5137620	Donald O'Connor.
5137620	5138620	It's funnier than Gene Kelly.
5138620	5139620	Donald O'Connor.
5139620	5140620	From the Talking Mule movies.
5140620	5141620	Yeah, yeah.
5141620	5143620	Also from Singin' in the Rain.
5143620	5144620	Singin' in the Rain, yeah.
5144620	5146620	He's the guy who runs and does the flips off the wall.
5146620	5147620	He jumps off the wall, yeah.
5147620	5148620	He makes them laugh.
5148620	5149620	All right.
5149620	5150620	You know what?
5150620	5153620	As long as she's happy and has agency.
5153620	5155620	And then for you.
5155620	5156620	Then I'm gonna come.
5156620	5157620	Jane.
5157620	5159620	Then call back for Dan, Mark Ruffalo.
5159620	5160620	Mark Ruffalo.
5160620	5161620	Yeah.
5162620	5163620	Yeah.
5163620	5165620	I'd watch him fuck me.
5167620	5168620	That's how much I wanna watch him fuck.
5168620	5170620	I think he said once you wanted him to show you how to guard.
5170620	5173620	I love Mark Ruffalo.
5173620	5174620	Dan.
5174620	5175620	Dan.
5175620	5177620	Let's say you're having a dream where you're a fuck man.
5177620	5178620	Mark Ruffalo, David Duchovny.
5178620	5180620	You know, if you go to a gay place.
5180620	5181620	Okay, here we go.
5181620	5182620	Here we go.
5182620	5183620	Loosen up.
5183620	5184620	I have more ready answers for dudes.
5184620	5185620	All right.
5185620	5186620	If I.
5186620	5187620	If I.
5187620	5188620	If I.

5196620	5197620	If I.
5197620	5198620	You know.
5198620	5199620	It's hard to say.
5199620	5200620	I'm sorry.
5200620	5201620	I.
5201620	5202620	I think it's weird that you're yelling things out,
5202620	5208620	but I do want to hear what you're like.
5208620	5209620	But Roger Morris.
5209620	5211620	It's your more.
5211620	5213620	I've heard a lot of interesting things.
5213620	5214620	Right.
5214620	5218620	We take you now to Roger Moore fucking Dan Herman.
5218620	5219620	Prince.
5219620	5220620	Prince.
5220620	5221620	Oh.

5225620	5226620	And my open butthole.
5226620	5227620	Waiting.
5227620	5228620	Waiting.
5228620	5229620	Waiting to learn.
5229620	5235620	What it means to be a real man.
5235620	5237620	I think we've made some progress here.
5237620	5238620	Yeah.
5238620	5239620	Yeah.
5239620	5240620	Would you bet your ass?
5240620	5243620	I want to say James.
5243620	5244620	Scott.
5244620	5245620	Scott.
5245620	5246620	Yeah.
5246620	5247620	Who would you like to see?
5247620	5249620	Fuck Dino male or female.
5249620	5250620	If you had to.
5250620	5252620	If you had to fantasize.
5252620	5253620	Not on stage.
5253620	5259620	You got to pick anybody in the world to be in bed and having complicated sex with.
5259620	5262620	And these are people I've never actually seen fucking him before.
5262620	5263620	No.
5263620	5264620	It could be.
5264620	5268620	It could be anybody in the world past or present.
5268620	5269620	That guy.
5269620	5270620	That guy.
5270620	5272620	Let's bring him up.
5272620	5274620	Let's bring him up.
5274620	5276620	Come up here.
5276620	5278620	Get the fuck up on stage.

5280620	5281620	Where is he?
5281620	5282620	Jesus Christ.
5282620	5283620	There's a guy with a beard coming.
5283620	5284620	Where'd he go?
5284620	5285620	He's coming.
5285620	5286620	Where is he?
5286620	5287620	He's leaving.
5287620	5288620	Wait.
5288620	5289620	He doesn't know how the stage is this way.
5289620	5290620	Okay.
5290620	5291620	Oh dear.
5291620	5292620	Have you not been looking the wrong way?
5292620	5293620	Sexy Spencer.
5293620	5295620	Sexy Spencer's on stage everybody.
5295620	5296620	Here baby.

5303620	5304620	Yes.
5304620	5305620	Yes.
5305620	5306620	Can I get this for the other guy?
5306620	5307620	Yeah.
5307620	5308620	I'm sorry.
5308620	5309620	I'm losing this up a little bit.
5309620	5310620	Watch out.
5310620	5311620	Watch your name sir.
5311620	5312620	Yeah.
5312620	5313620	What's your name?
5313620	5314620	Vincent.
5314620	5315620	Vincent.
5315620	5316620	Vincent, take your fucking pants off.
5316620	5317620	Do you want to take my mic off?
5317620	5318620	Take my mic off?
5318620	5319620	Do you want to take my fucking pants off?
5319620	5320620	Hello everybody.
5320620	5321620	What do you want me to say?
5321620	5322620	My pants off.
5322620	5323620	What are we going to do?
5323620	5324620	A scene?
5324620	5325620	A scene?
5325620	5326620	What?
5326620	5327620	What?
5327620	5328620	What?
5328620	5329620	What?
5329620	5330620	What are we going to do?
5330620	5331620	A scene?
5331620	5332620	Are we really doing the scene?
5332620	5335620	I think we should do a scene with Vincent, right?
5335620	5336620	We should do it.
5336620	5337620	Just get it over with.
5337620	5338620	I don't want to be in it.
5338620	5339620	No.
5339620	5340620	Dino, you're in it.
5340620	5341620	Because this is about you.
5341620	5342620	Just do the scene.
5342620	5346620	If we don't make it a scene Dino can just fuck this guy right now.
5346620	5347620	Yeah.
5347620	5350620	That I can do.
5350620	5354260	So I'll save you $800.
5354260	5355260	No questions.
5355260	5356260	No denials.
5356260	5359140	Do an improv scene.
5359160	5360140	I've seen about what?
5360140	5363140	Just fucking Dino.
5363140	5364140	Dino.
5364140	5365140	Dino.
5365140	5366140	Dino.
5366140	5367140	Dino.
5367140	5369140	I deserve it.
5369140	5372140	I deserve it.
5372140	5375140	You're not worthy of having a real name.
5375140	5376140	Can you beat me?
5376140	5377140	No.
5377140	5378140	Please.
5378140	5380140	Well, we're in a library.
5380140	5382140	Is this going to pop?
5382140	5385140	The library is burning down.
5385140	5387140	And they are firemen coming.
5387140	5388140	Who wants to be a fireman?
5388140	5390140	Well, you don't have to narrate.
5390140	5391140	Huh?
5391140	5394140	You could just be in the moment.
5394140	5395140	He doesn't even know.
5395140	5399140	I don't even know how to improv and he's worse than me.
5399140	5400140	We're in a library.
5400140	5403140	Vincent, this is God.
5403140	5406140	Tickle Gino's tits.
5406140	5407140	Continue.
5407140	5408140	Continue tits.
5408140	5410140	All right, wait, wait, wait a second here.
5410140	5411140	Here's the thing.
5411140	5413140	I mean, we could do it.
5413140	5414140	It might get some reaction.
5414140	5415140	I don't think it's going to be that funny.
5415140	5417140	Dino, this is not God.
5417140	5420140	God just told you to let this guy tickle your tits.
5420140	5421140	All right, tickle my tits.
5421140	5426140	It's not going to tickle.
5426140	5428140	Okay.
5428140	5431140	All right, tickle.
5431140	5432140	Okay.
5432140	5433140	Hi.
5433140	5434140	Thank you for that.
5434140	5436140	Five minutes earlier at God's house.
5436140	5437140	Who's going to start this thing?
5437140	5439140	Five minutes earlier at God's house.
5439140	5442140	Oh, God.
5442140	5446140	There are days and there are days.
5446140	5447140	What is this?
5447140	5450140	Why do I have to?
5450140	5452140	Oh, am I in this or not?
5452140	5453140	Well, no.
5453140	5454140	God.
5454140	5456140	Yeah, I'm a secretary.
5456140	5458140	Well, I'm just going over this ledger.
5458140	5461140	In four and a half minutes, you have to make somebody tickle somebody's tits.
5461140	5464140	Yeah.
5464140	5467140	Is this about gay people again?
5467140	5469140	No, no.
5469140	5472140	Don't be transnormative.
5472140	5473140	Get back.
5473140	5475140	I'm God.
5475140	5480140	God, this is your God.
5480140	5481140	Holy shit.
5481140	5482140	Holy shit.
5482140	5483140	Jesus Christ.
5483140	5484140	What the fuck?
5484140	5485140	Holy fucking shit.
5485140	5486140	Holy shit.
5486140	5487140	God.
5487140	5488140	You're in Daphne?
5488140	5489140	Daphne, get out of here.
5489140	5490140	Get out of here.
5490140	5491140	God.
5491140	5492140	Get out.
5492140	5493140	Daphne, you're back.
5493140	5494140	Get out.
5494140	5495140	Get out.
5495140	5496140	Fuck you.
5496140	5497140	Fuck you.
5497140	5498140	Get out.
5498140	5499140	I'm not taking any calls.
5499140	5500140	Yes, sir.
5500140	5501140	Yes, sir.
5501140	5504140	Yes, sir.
5504140	5508140	Don't grovel if there's one thing I can't stand as groveling.
5508140	5509140	No, I know that.
5509140	5510140	I know that.
5510140	5511140	I know that.
5511140	5512140	I'm not doing it.
5512140	5513140	I'm not groveling.
5513140	5515140	I'm just being God the way you said I should be.
5515140	5520140	I started as nothing, exploded into everything, and made a universe where everyone's confused.
5520140	5522140	There's someone who has a message for you, God.
5522140	5523140	God.
5523140	5524140	God.
5524140	5527140	This is God, God, God.
5527140	5528140	Sorry.
5528140	5530140	You're breaking up.
5530140	5533140	This is God, God, God.
5533140	5534140	Hang on.
5534140	5535140	I've got another call.
5535140	5536140	God, God?
5536140	5537140	Yes, God, God, God.
5537140	5538140	Fuck.
5538140	5539140	Shit.
5539140	5541140	You're doing a great job.
5541140	5542140	Fucking keep it going.
5542140	5543140	Oh, man.
5543140	5544140	That's a blessing.
5544140	5545140	I guess.
5545140	5546140	Why, God?
5546140	5549140	If he's on hold, I might as well just make aids.
5549140	5550140	God.
5550140	5551140	God.
5551140	5553140	Oh, I was too late.
5553140	5554140	Aids.
5554140	5555140	Aids.
5555140	5556140	Aids.
5556140	5557140	Aids.
5557140	5558140	Hey, hey.
5558140	5559140	Stop it.
5559140	5560140	Stop it.
5560140	5561140	Aids.
5561140	5562140	Aids.
5562140	5563140	God, please.
5563140	5564140	I'm sorry, sir.
5564140	5565140	What?
5565140	5566140	I'm glad I got that.
5566140	5567140	No, I didn't hear you.
5567140	5568140	God, God.
5568140	5569140	God, God, God.
5569140	5570140	Hang on one second.
5570140	5571140	God, God?
5571140	5572140	Yes, God, God, God.
5572140	5573140	This is God.
5573140	5574140	I know who it is.
5574140	5577140	The only person who can talk to me like this.
5577140	5580140	Why does God keep creating aids?
5580140	5583140	Can we stop this guy from creating aids all over the place?
5583140	5586140	I had just stopped him when you called me to you.
5586140	5588140	I gave you two jobs.
5588140	5589140	Two jobs.
5589140	5593140	One was to not let this guy create aids all over the place.
5593140	5595140	Also, SIDS is a bummer.
5595140	5597140	SIDS is a bummer.
5597140	5600140	All right, I'll take care of both.
5600140	5601140	We're breaking up.
5601140	5603140	I'm the worst God ever.
5603140	5604140	Boop, boop.
5604140	5605140	Hey, God.
5605140	5606140	Yeah.
5606140	5608140	All right, let's stop with the aids, or at least diminish it by...
5608140	5610140	Oh, yeah, you buried the lead, buddy.
5610140	5612140	I just gave everyone aids.
5612140	5613140	Everybody?
5613140	5614140	Yeah.
5614140	5615140	Okay, we'll go to 16.
5615140	5616140	Everyone aids.
5617140	5618140	Okay, listen.
5618140	5620140	Oh, too soon?
5620140	5623140	Fucking donate some money, you pricks.
5627140	5629140	Oh, oh, oh.
5629140	5630140	I'm sorry.
5630140	5631140	I'm...
5631140	5632140	It's guilty.
5632140	5633140	No, it's okay.
5633140	5635140	I'm glad you're finally talking to people down on earth.
5635140	5636140	What?
5636140	5637140	I'm sorry.
5637140	5638140	What?
5638140	5639140	Aids.
5639140	5640140	What?
5640140	5641140	Hello?
5641140	5642140	Listen, God, there's someone who has to talk to you, who has a message for you, and you
5642140	5643140	need to talk to this person.
5643140	5644140	Do you understand?
5644140	5645140	Yeah, yeah.
5645140	5647140	Am I gonna get fired?
5647140	5652140	The name of this person is Jane, okay?
5652140	5654140	You can call me Goddess.
5657140	5658140	Well, what?
5658140	5659140	Which is it?
5659140	5661140	Go to bed.
5661140	5662140	Really?
5662140	5664140	You've been a naughty boy.
5664140	5666140	It's time to go to bed, God.
5666140	5668140	Good night.
5671140	5672140	It's okay.
5673140	5675140	I'm sleeping.
5675140	5676140	I'm sleeping.
5677140	5679140	Sleepy God.
5680140	5681140	Sleepy God.
5681140	5683140	Sleepy God.
5683140	5684140	Kissy, kissy.
5685140	5687140	Kissy, kissy.
5687140	5688140	No water.
5688140	5689140	Stay in bed.
5689140	5690140	I'm just kissing.
5690140	5691140	No water.
5691140	5693140	Go to bed.
5693140	5696140	Meanwhile, in God's dream...
5699140	5701140	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
5702140	5704140	Dun, dun, dun, dun.
5707140	5708140	Hello.
5708140	5709140	My name is Penny.
5711140	5712140	And scene!
5713140	5714140	Okay.
5715140	5716140	All right.
5717140	5718140	That's probably good enough.
5719140	5720140	Big hand for Vincent, everybody.
5720140	5721140	Let's thank that guy.
5721140	5722140	He came up with...
5725140	5727140	Let's give New York something.
5727140	5728140	I want to talk.
5728140	5729140	I swear to God.
5729140	5730140	I know.
5730140	5731140	I know.
5731140	5732140	I know.
5732140	5733140	I know.
5733140	5734140	I know.
5734140	5735140	I know this is a bad thing.
5735140	5736140	I know this is me being a bad, a bad podcaster.
5736140	5738140	But I swear to God, like, I want...
5738140	5739140	I just...
5739140	5740140	When Jane was like...
5740140	5743140	Like, for a while, like, Jane was, like, not coming up on the podcast.
5743140	5746140	And I was, like, so excited about her coming up.
5746140	5747140	And I...
5748140	5749140	I just...
5749140	5753140	I'm 42 years old and I'm talking to every 16-year-old out there.
5753140	5755140	That has Tumblr messaged me.
5755140	5757140	That doesn't like me.
5757140	5761140	And it says, like, I think you're a fat piece of shit.
5761140	5768140	But, like, Jane being on the show makes me think that you may not be a fat piece of shit.
5768140	5769140	And you're wrong.
5769140	5771140	I am a fat piece of shit.
5771140	5772140	But you're right.
5772140	5773140	I...
5774140	5779140	Like, you have no idea how many lives that you've probably saved.
5779140	5781140	Because you've been nice.
5781140	5782140	And...
5786140	5787140	And I think that...
5787140	5792140	I think that you've probably gone through, like, probably some pain.
5792140	5796140	I think that people have probably beaten you online.
5796140	5799140	And I want to try to offset that and say,
5799140	5802140	here's your crown, here's your fucking scepter.
5802140	5805140	Because you're, like, through all of it,
5805140	5808140	this roller coaster ride of me going from, like,
5808140	5810140	like, what, what are you, a guy or a girl?
5810140	5812140	I don't know what's going on, man, man, man.
5812140	5816140	Like, you've been the person that has, like...
5816140	5821140	Like, you're the George Washington of everything.
5825140	5828140	She's the George Washington of everything.
5829140	5830140	So...
5830140	5831140	End scene!
5831140	5833140	Where can I go with the end scene?
5833140	5834140	Yeah.
5835140	5836140	Um...
5836140	5838140	I guess...
5840140	5841140	Yeah, I mean, it's...
5841140	5843140	I'm not used to being well-known.
5843140	5845140	Fist-tuned?
5845140	5846140	With, well...
5846140	5847140	Genius?
5847140	5848140	Well, no, no, that...
5848140	5849140	Oh, sorry, no, no, no, no.
5849140	5851140	He was talking for a second.
5851140	5852140	No, no, no.
5852140	5853140	But, no, it's...
5853140	5854140	I wasn't fishing for that.
5854140	5855140	There are...
5855140	5856140	So hard to do.
5857140	5859140	There's been lots of people who...
5859140	5864140	Actually, very few people who've really, like, approached me on Twitter or something,
5864140	5866140	who've really come after me.
5866140	5867140	But when they do, of course...
5867140	5868140	I mean, it hurts.
5868140	5871140	And because, I mean, this has hurt my whole life.
5871140	5875140	But it's also, because of the opportunity that you've given,
5875140	5877140	I'm gonna turn this around on you.
5877140	5879140	What do people say...
5879140	5881140	Jane, what do people say online that hurts?
5881140	5882140	Like, how do they come at you?
5882140	5885140	I can't imagine somebody would come at you in a hurtful way.
5885140	5886140	Oh, no, really?
5886140	5888140	People are great.
5889140	5890140	What the fuck is the matter?
5890140	5891140	It happens.
5891140	5895140	We'll have a natural grace to them that just compounds the imagination.
5898140	5902140	I mean, there's situations where people say,
5902140	5904140	what the hell is trans?
5904140	5906140	You're really a guy.
5906140	5908140	You know, go kill yourself.
5908140	5910140	I mean, you get that level of, yeah, absolutely.
5910140	5914140	If you're 16 and you don't know who you are,
5914140	5918140	like, it's good for you to get passionate about this shit,
5918140	5922140	and it's good for you to look at someone like me and go,
5922140	5924140	that guy's Jim Belugey.
5924140	5925140	I don't like him.
5925140	5929140	Like, I totally support you and accept that.
5929140	5933140	Like, but the idea that anybody ever said to you,
5933140	5936140	because you came on the show and because you talked to me,
5936140	5939140	and because I use the pronoun...
5939140	5941140	Yeah, so that happens.
5941140	5943140	Oh, you're a piece of shit.
5943140	5946140	You fucking sold out now, mama.
5946140	5949140	Those people are good people, and, well, everyone's good people,
5949140	5951140	and I'm going to take a shit on the stage.
5951140	5953140	Yeah, go ahead.
5953140	5956140	Also, like, a million people got shot last night.
5956140	5958140	All right, go ahead.
5958140	5961140	Thanks for that, T.F.
5961140	5965140	Too late?
5965140	5966140	Too real.
5966140	5967140	Not real enough.
5967140	5968140	I don't know.
5968140	5969140	We had to walk through...
5969140	5972140	I'm sorry, I didn't kind of distract us with that.
5972140	5976140	There's 12 NYPD guys outside the...
5976140	5980140	For me, because we talked about this earlier today,
5980140	5984140	I'm a dummy coming late to the party of knowing how to...
5984140	5987140	I have a vocabulary about how to address it,
5987140	5990140	and so pronouns is the trouble for me.
5990140	5994140	We just want to know how to say things, but meeting you...
5994140	5998140	You're my first introduction into saying...
5998140	6007140	Having a concept about the idea that gender could be any old thing,
6007140	6009140	could be anything, right?
6009140	6012140	It really comes down to...
6012140	6015140	From the part of the person who's presenting themselves
6015140	6019140	or representing themselves as a non-traditional gender combination
6019140	6021140	or whatever it is.
6021140	6023140	Sensitivity just has to be there from everybody.
6023140	6027140	Everyone's kind of coming into this new game
6028140	6029140	kind of unprepared.
6029140	6031140	Our culture isn't prepared to deal with it.
6031140	6033140	Our language isn't prepared to deal with it.
6033140	6038140	So given that and given the fact that people deserve to be treated humanely
6038140	6041140	on both sides, everyone...
6041140	6042140	Well, don't be a dick.
6042140	6046140	I mean, everyone has to be ready to engage.
6046140	6049140	And if someone isn't ready to engage, say, with me
6049140	6054140	and they insist on calling me, he, he, he, or whatever...
6054140	6056140	What am I going to do? Change them? No?
6056140	6058140	And if we're going to change them at all, I'm going to change them
6058140	6060140	by just continuing to be a good person.
6060140	6063140	And you've just got to learn to let things roll off your back.
6063140	6065140	I've been letting things roll off my back for a long time.
6065140	6066140	Yeah.
6066140	6068140	The world is not going to...
6068140	6071140	I mean, the world isn't going to change in my lifetime.
6071140	6073140	I can't...
6073140	6076140	But I've got to go on and have my life and have it as good as I can
6076140	6078140	and make the life as good for other people.
6078140	6080140	But what's great about you and also other friends of ours
6080140	6084140	is that when we fuck up, when we mispronounce,
6084140	6088140	and we say the wrong thing, you never go, you did it wrong.
6088140	6090140	You never shame us for saying...
6090140	6092140	You should be ashamed of yourself. No, absolutely.
6092140	6094140	You should be ashamed of yourself. There's no resolution there.
6094140	6097140	You did it wrong. Here's how to do it right.
6097140	6100140	That's not how you teach people. That's not how you model good behavior.
6100140	6102140	You just step back.
6102140	6105140	And if there's an opportunity to reengage and educate,
6105140	6107140	great, you do that. If it's not...
6107140	6109140	This isn't a formal education. It's informal education.
6109140	6111140	It's nice being in a city.
6111140	6113140	There are cities all over the world
6113140	6116140	where people are progressive
6116140	6119140	and open themselves up to this stuff.
6119140	6121140	The fact that there's a conversation that happens about this...
6121140	6124140	When I was a kid, there was gay, straight,
6124140	6127140	and maybe a third color called bi.
6127140	6130140	There were three colors in that.
6130140	6132140	I was hungry.
6132140	6140140	But the idea now that sexuality can be any shade, any thing,
6140140	6143140	is a new thing for everybody.
6143140	6146140	It's always been there.
6146140	6149140	We never have vocabulary for it.
6149140	6151140	Exactly. That's what's been brilliant lately.
6151140	6154140	Really coming from kids mostly,
6154140	6158140	is just redefining the language and coming up with all these great terms.
6158140	6165140	Unfortunately, it makes for the alphabet suit of LGBTQQIA.
6165140	6174140	You look like a guy wearing a converse and jeans and stuff.
6174140	6179140	To say she, I have to wrap my brain around that.
6179140	6183140	It's a new thing that I have to let myself do.
6183140	6185140	Let me tell you an interesting story.
6185140	6188140	Every time I go when I fly and I go through the airport
6188140	6192140	and I go through the porno scanner,
6192140	6194140	I get flagged.
6194140	6196140	And I'm usually dressing...
6196140	6198140	I tend to present relatively male.
6198140	6202140	But because I come through and I'm presenting male,
6202140	6205140	it is someone's job, and it's going to be...
6205140	6208140	It's honestly someone's job to push a button on that machine.
6208140	6212140	A pink button or a blue button, literally,
6212140	6216140	that they read, okay, I'm reading this person as male,
6216140	6218140	push the blue button.
6218140	6220140	That sets up a particular algorithm in the machine
6220140	6223140	that then says, okay, look, when you do this scan,
6223140	6227140	if there's anything close to the outline of a standard body
6227140	6230140	that is an anomaly, that person needs to be checked.
6230140	6233140	So if I'm going through and I'm reading as male,
6233140	6235140	I'm wearing a bra.
6235140	6239140	And so I have a bra strap in the back that sets off the machine.
6239140	6241140	I always have to be stepped over.
6241140	6243140	And that's the pink button, right?
6243140	6246140	No, so they push the blue button.
6246140	6249140	I thought pink meant, like, your dick color.
6249140	6251140	No, no, no, no, no, no.
6251140	6253140	That's a different pink.
6253140	6255140	That's the color of his dick.
6255140	6257140	I didn't know.
6257140	6258140	Trying to read that.
6258140	6259140	I didn't know.
6259140	6261140	Yeah, be educated.
6264140	6266140	But the thing that's also really fucked up, then,
6266140	6268140	is because I was read as male,
6268140	6272140	a guy comes up to actually do my pat-downs.
6272140	6273140	By the way, I mean...
6273140	6275140	But then I have to look him in the eye and say,
6275140	6278140	he says, there's something between your shoulder blades.
6278140	6281140	And I have to go, it's my bra.
6281140	6282140	Right.
6282140	6284140	But that puts it on me.
6284140	6285140	I'll do it.
6285140	6287140	And it feels pretty cool to do it.
6287140	6288140	But it's also...
6288140	6290140	It sucks.
6290140	6293140	It sucks that there's a system in place at this point.
6293140	6295140	I mean, it's not just, like, friends misreading
6295140	6298140	or messing up on a pronoun.
6298140	6300140	This is an entire system, security system,
6300140	6302140	I'm forced to go through to go on...
6302140	6304140	I could go around, I could do TSA pre-check
6304140	6307140	or I could just go straight to a pat-down or custom email.
6307140	6310140	They all know 95% is not effective.
6310140	6314140	And they're trying their best because they're going,
6314140	6319140	oh, what we don't want is for a lady to feel violated
6319140	6323140	by a dude going, oh, are you Al-Qaeda?
6323140	6325140	You're a pussy.
6325140	6327140	They're trying.
6327140	6331140	They made their rules based on actually respect.
6331140	6335140	But based on respect of a dichotomy
6335140	6337140	that has been sort of irrelevant...
6337140	6339140	So the hardest thing we all have to do now
6339140	6341140	is release from the fucking dichotomy.
6341140	6342140	And that's the education thing,
6342140	6343140	just letting people know.
6343140	6345140	It would be great for bars and restaurants
6345140	6347140	because how much real estate do you think?
6347140	6349140	The fact that you have to have a men's room
6349140	6352140	and a women's room, it's like you fucking combine them.
6352140	6354140	I make one shitty bathroom.
6354140	6356140	There's a hole in the floor and you're like,
6356140	6360140	shit, I'm gonna shit in the fuck.
6360140	6364140	The place in Paris that you were talking about.
6364140	6365140	La Paris?
6365140	6367140	Yeah.
6367140	6369140	I got this picture at an airport
6369140	6372140	and it was the male bathroom, the female bathroom.
6372140	6374140	It actually had male symbols there
6374140	6376140	and blue lights of above and pink lights.
6376140	6378140	But in between there was this brick wall
6378140	6379140	in between the male and the female.
6379140	6381140	And so I did this picture where it was like,
6381140	6383140	that's bathroom nine and three quarters.
6383140	6387140	That's where I need to go through that wall.
6387140	6389140	It's like all these fantasy bathrooms.
6389140	6392140	It's like trans men who are in bathrooms
6392140	6395140	doing selfies and they're all bummed out.
6395140	6398140	They have to be in the women's room
6398140	6400140	according to the new rules.
6400140	6401140	I'm sad.
6401140	6405140	I look like Tom Scarritt, but I'm sad in the women's room.
6405140	6413140	I'm gonna do a podcast history rap.
6413140	6421140	And it's going to make your struggle, Jane,
6421140	6423140	seem like nothing.
6423140	6429140	I'm going to actually, everyone who's ever had a problem,
6429140	6432140	I'm gonna make you feel like shit.
6432140	6437140	Because I'm going back to the streets.
6437140	6440140	And if you think you suffered,
6440140	6443140	you're full of shit.
6443140	6446140	Because equality.
6446140	6449140	Yo.
6449140	6451140	Yo.
6451140	6452140	Yo.
6452140	6453140	Yo.
6453140	6454140	Everybody.
6454140	6455140	Yo.
6455140	6456140	Okay.
6456140	6457140	Yo.
6457140	6458140	Sorry.
6458140	6459140	I was distracted by this.
6459140	6460140	Yo.
6460140	6461140	I'm gonna do it.
6461140	6462140	Okay.
6462140	6463140	Yo.
6463140	6468140	The transgender community is going to like this rap.
6468140	6471140	They're very easy to please.
6471140	6474140	And then they're going to like this rap.
6474140	6475140	Yo.
6475140	6476140	Yo.
6476140	6477140	Yo.
6477140	6478140	Yo.
6478140	6479140	Yo.
6479140	6480140	Podcast history.
6480140	6481140	Just kidding.

6516140	6517140	Okay.
6517140	6518140	Let's just slow it down.
6518140	6519140	This rap is...
6519140	6521140	That was the transgender...
6521140	6522140	They got that.
6522140	6523140	No.
6523140	6524140	Go back to the slow rap.
6524140	6525140	I like that.
6525140	6528140	The transgender community got their rap.
6528140	6529140	That was good.
6529140	6532140	If they're not satisfied with that, frankly...
6532140	6533140	Here we go.
6533140	6534140	What?
6534140	6535140	There's no pleasing them.
6535140	6536140	Den.
6536140	6538140	This rap is for the ladies.
6538140	6539140	Here we go.
6539140	6542140	This one's going to fly out to the ladies.
6542140	6544140	The cisgender ladies.
6544140	6546140	This is for the Armenian ladies.

6567140	6572140	I'm going to give you a car.
6572140	6577140	Your hair is probably red.
6577140	6579140	And it's shoulder length.
6579140	6582140	And that's good.
6582140	6588140	And when I see you, I don't perceive you as human.
6588140	6592140	But I worship you.
6592140	6595140	So, hey.
6595140	6597140	What's the big deal?
6597140	6603140	Can't I just play Minecraft?
6603140	6606140	Can't we work out some kind of arrangement?
6606140	6608140	Because I love you.

6647140	6650140	I don't understand what's going on.
6650140	6661140	But my self-esteem is low enough that I will try this.

7099140	7103140	So what he told me is women be shopping.
7105140	7111140	And it reminds me of the fact I have a test.
7111140	7114140	I know you ladies don't want to shop.
7116140	7121140	I know you don't want to shop, but you do shop.
7123140	7125140	And so I came up with a little test.
7126140	7131140	If you know whether you like to shop, I came up with a test.
7132140	7143140	For instance, if you think hot dogs are things that you should shop for,
7145140	7147140	you might be a woman.
7156140	7157140	Yeah.
7157140	7158140	Yeah.
7158140	7159140	Yeah.
7159140	7160140	Yeah.
7160140	7161140	Yeah.
7161140	7162140	Yeah.
7162140	7163140	Yeah.
7163140	7164140	Yeah.
7164140	7165140	Yeah.
7165140	7166140	Yeah.
7171140	7173140	Yeah.
7173140	7174140	Yeah.
7174140	7175140	Yeah.
7175140	7176140	Yeah.
7181140	7182140	So don't let your dick.
7182140	7183140	Don't let your dick fall out.
7183140	7184140	There's cops in the room.
7184140	7185140	What?
7185140	7186140	Don't let your dick fall out.
7186140	7187140	Okay.
7187140	7191140	So tonight there's a lot of ladies in the room.
7191140	7192140	Am I right?
7194140	7195140	You know who you are.
7196140	7197140	You know what you do.
7198140	7200140	You know what you're doing.
7203140	7204140	You know what you do.
7204140	7206140	You know my how you do it.
7206140	7210140	The thing about women is women do a good thing.
7210140	7212140	Women are good people.
7213140	7216140	They're exactly the same as men in every respect.
7217140	7218140	Every respect.
7219140	7222140	However, women are different.
7225140	7227140	Biochemically they're different.
7228140	7229140	No.
7229140	7230140	Yeah.
7230140	7231140	Yeah.
7231140	7232140	Yeah.
7232140	7233140	No.
7233140	7234140	He's a woman.
7234140	7235140	He's a woman.
7235140	7237140	So for instance, couple of examples.
7243140	7246140	Let's say what happens is an apocalypse.
7247140	7250140	Let's say nuclear weapons go down.
7250140	7252140	Every guy is blown up.
7252140	7254140	Fuck that.
7255140	7257140	Every guy is blown up.
7257140	7258140	You were driving around.
7258140	7260140	You got rubber tire armor.
7260140	7263140	You got armor made out of rubber tires.
7263140	7265140	You're like, I'm driving.
7265140	7266140	I need some water.
7266140	7268140	I need some gasoline.
7268140	7270140	But I'm a man.
7270140	7272140	And you run into a woman.
7272140	7274140	She got a robot arm?
7287140	7289140	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
7289140	7291140	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
7291140	7295140	I will elect you to say, sorry, sorry.
7295140	7296140	Sorry, sorry.
7296140	7297140	Yeah.
7297140	7298140	Yeah.
7301140	7302140	Okay, okay.
7302140	7303140	I'm sorry about that.
7303140	7304140	I'm sorry about that.
7306140	7308140	But you got a robot arm.
7309140	7313140	In the middle of an apocalyptic wasteland.
7313140	7315140	You got a robot arm.
7318140	7320140	Anyways, what else is going on?
7322140	7325140	You see these people as Donald Trump's.
7326140	7329140	Donald Trump's be talking about some shit.
7331140	7333140	This guy's running for president.
7333140	7335140	He says, I want to be president.
7335140	7337140	My name's Donald Trump.
7339140	7340140	Think about it.
7341140	7343140	Why would you want to be president
7343140	7345140	if your name was Donald Trump?
7345140	7348140	Why not just be Donald Trump?
7348140	7351140	That's more powerful than a president.
7352140	7354140	Don't be president.
7355140	7358140	You could be president of a company.
7359140	7361140	You could be president of a...
7363140	7364140	Sorry.
7364140	7365140	Yeah.
7365140	7366140	Yeah.
7366140	7367140	Yeah.
7367140	7368140	Yeah.
7368140	7369140	I'm saying, it's not a joke.
7369140	7372140	I'm saying like Donald Trump should be happy by now.
7372140	7375140	He was born with a standard amount of wealth.
7376140	7379140	Like standard for a white man.
7379140	7381140	But he had enough wealth.
7381140	7384140	And relative to his position,
7384140	7388140	like what he did with his wealth is actually a failure.
7388140	7390140	So why is him...
7390140	7392140	Why is he...
7392140	7397140	You should look at him and say he did a bad job.
7397140	7398140	I'm sorry.
7398140	7399140	Hold on one second.
7399140	7400140	Hold on.
7400140	7401140	Let's go.
7401140	7403140	What's happening?
7403140	7404140	Listen.
7404140	7405140	Okay.
7405140	7406140	No, it's okay.
7406140	7407140	It's okay.
7408140	7413140	It's a horrible thing for Trump to think
7413140	7420140	that he has anything close to any opportunity to become the president.
7420140	7423140	But it's entertaining, right?
7423140	7424140	Right.
7424140	7427140	But what if women were in charge of the political process?
7428140	7431140	Oh, you know that would be different.
7431140	7436140	You know if women were in charge of presidents,
7436140	7440140	that shit would go real fast.
7441140	7444140	You'd be like, oh, I'd like to be president.
7444140	7446140	They'd be like...
7455140	7456140	Hold on.
7456140	7457140	Hold on.
7457140	7458140	Hold on.
7458140	7459140	Hold on.
7459140	7460140	Can you hold this?
7460140	7461140	I hold.
7470140	7483140	Yeah, everybody needs to get calm.
7483140	7486140	Everybody needs to do some...
7486140	7488140	Everything's fucked up.
7488140	7489140	Shit.
7489140	7492140	What else is going on?
7492140	7494140	You got ISIS?
7494140	7498140	You got ISIS?
7498140	7499140	ISIS?
7500140	7503140	ISIS is bad.
7504140	7506140	Bad people.
7506140	7508140	These people are bad people.
7508140	7510140	Shit.
7511140	7517140	You walk around, you got ISIS talking about shopping, women.
7517140	7523140	If ISIS were women, that would go a lot differently.
7524140	7528140	If ISIS were women, they'd be out of business.
7533140	7542140	Because women aren't human, nor is ISIS.
7542140	7547140	So if you do both together, they...
7548140	7553140	Everybody's doing something different.
7553140	7556140	Everybody's always doing something different.
7556140	7558140	Everybody's doing something different.
7558140	7561140	Nobody ever wants to know what's going on.
7561140	7563140	Everybody wants to know what's going on.
7563140	7565140	Nobody wants to know what's going on!
7565140	7568140	For instance...
7568140	7570140	No, come on.
7570140	7573140	Don't, don't, don't shame...
7573140	7577140	No, don't...
7577140	7579140	Don't...
7579140	7582140	No, don't...
7582140	7586140	My dick is small.
7586140	7588140	It's going to be a big deal if you find out my dick is small.
7588140	7590140	I told you all, my dick is small.
7590140	7594140	Don't...
7594140	7596140	Alright, so...
7596140	7599140	Okay.
7599140	7602140	Alright, well, okay.
7602140	7606140	So...
7606140	7608140	Everything knows going wrong.
7608140	7613140	Those sounds make a combination of syllables going wrong, going down.
7613140	7619140	Every syllable goes down if you say it a certain way.
7619140	7625140	If you say words different, they will sound effective.
7625140	7628140	If you say them different, you'll say the same thing.
7628140	7630140	Every time.
7630140	7636140	I'm a person you've endowed with the power to tell you how to vote.
7636140	7639140	So obviously I'm going to tell you to vote for keeping voting.
7639140	7640140	Keep voting!
7640140	7641140	Keep voting!
7641140	7643140	Keep voting!
7643140	7644140	You gotta...
7644140	7649140	Everyone go into a room every four years and pull a lever.
7649140	7657140	And as long as you've done that, your hands are clean.
7657140	7659140	You're a good person.
7659140	7664140	Keep paying your taxes and keep voting.
7664140	7671140	I'll leave you with one thought.
7671140	7675140	I'll leave you with one thought.
7675140	7676140	It's not...
7676140	7677140	I don't know what the...
7677140	7678140	What's the joke?
7678140	7680140	Oh, look at how small my dick is.
7680140	7681140	I get it.
7681140	7682140	I got a small dick.
7682140	7685140	My dick's a nipple.
7685140	7686140	You know what?
7686140	7687140	You're good.
7687140	7695140	And when you have a nipple for a dick, you start to open your eyes to what's going on.
7695140	7698140	You say to the ladies, well, you want to see my dick?
7698140	7700140	She goes, yeah, let me see it.
7700140	7701140	You show it to her.
7701140	7702140	That looks like a nipple.
7702140	7703140	Yeah.
7703140	7704140	Go shopping.
7704140	7705140	All right.
7705140	7706140	All right.
7706140	7707140	Okay.
7707140	7708140	All right.
7708140	7709140	Listen.
7709140	7710140	Listen.
7710140	7712140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7712140	7713140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7713140	7715140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7715140	7716140	South side.
7716140	7721140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7721140	7726140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7726140	7729140	South side.
7729140	7732140	I'm going to leave you with this.
7732140	7735140	South side.
7735140	7737140	South side.
7737140	7738140	East side.
7738140	7741140	Brooklyn, New York going to do the rest of the ride.
7741140	7743140	Everybody in New York going to do my ride.
7743140	7745140	Got those five burros going to do a ride.
7745140	7747140	You're going to sign your cast.
7747140	7748140	You're going to sign your cast.
7748140	7750140	Everybody going to do real last.
7750140	7753140	Got Brooklyn going to do a thing.
7753140	7755140	Everybody, Brooklyn, my ding-a-ling.
7755140	7757140	Oh, five burros on the tip.
7757140	7759140	I fucked your mama so hard.
7759140	7762140	That's it.
7762140	7763140	That's it.
7763140	7764140	That's words.
7764140	7765140	That's words.
7765140	7766140	Peace out.
7774140	7776140	Did you get any of that?
7776140	7779140	It's a good show.
