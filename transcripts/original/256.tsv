0	22720	Hello gang from beautiful uptown Burbank, Harminetown is now in session.
22720	26320	I say why bury the good stuff, let's bring out the great stuff Spencer Crittenden the
26320	38320	Game Master and the mayor of Harminetown and the landlord of your heart, Dan Harmon.
56320	74000	For the home listener, Dan has what can only be described as a new look, I place it equidistant
74000	84760	between Walter Cronkite and Captain Kangaroo with just a little suggestion of Stacey Keach.
84760	99580	It's for a movie, so you're judging a movie star, see where that'll get you, throw your
99580	109920	mud from aside the red carpet, it won't muss it, yeah it's for a movie, and here's the thing,
109920	116120	I toyed with it, I was like you know what I need to do, I leave the set of the movie
116120	121120	and then I was walking and I was going like oh I'm gonna go, I'm a couple blocks from
121120	128620	this bar, I'll go there and I'll have a drink and then I'll call an Uber or a Lyft if you
128620	134480	want to believe that I am helping and just haven't given up and don't want to be talked
134480	143600	to, but then halfway there I'm like oh shit fuck, god damn it I look like this, and then
143600	149320	it's just like I've been grappling for two days, I go like well what is it, because you
149320	155800	looked so good before, what is it, and then I was like oh okay no I didn't, I never thought
155800	160560	I looked good, but what I looked like before was someone who didn't care what he looked
160560	168560	like, this looks like someone was like what can I do, how am I driving, and that's the
168560	174040	deal breaker for me, and why is that the deal breaker for me, because oh I'm so honest,
174040	182700	I'm such an honest person, no it's like, then I'm like you should have a mustache, the person
182700	189520	I am inside looks like this, it's perfect because this is how much I care, I do want
189520	196280	to be cool this much, and I do fail this much, and I should, this is who I should be, this is how
196280	202360	I should get used to it, this is a big you know my zizek beard, and it's like oh so that if
202360	207240	somebody could go like hey you piece of shit, and I go what, I said you're a piece of shit,
207240	214000	I don't care, that's not true, that's not true, I don't think this look says that you care how
214000	220560	you look, it says that you care about the fact that at 1 p.m. President Kennedy is pronounced
220560	228800	dead, down in Texas, you have to put some, Vice President Johnson is on the plane, I mean I just
228800	233240	it's this is this is part I'm just saying this is a journey I have to go on, like I because I'll
233240	237640	tell you kids like a lot of you have tattoos piercings and things like that, I'll confess to
237640	242360	you don't don't I don't feel this way anymore, 15 years ago I would like if I somebody had like a
242360	247640	pierced lip or like a tattoo or something I would like secretly in my head I'd be like I don't trust
247640	253560	that person because they'd be like well they're they don't know they're you know they're so scared
253560	258080	like they're you know no one's gonna notice or that no one's gonna know who they are that they
258080	261160	don't know who they are that they had to take these measures and stuff it's like I would look
261160	264760	down on that I wouldn't look down on them but I would be like that's probably not that person's
264760	268200	not gonna get along with me because the real thing you're supposed to do is do that in front of a
268200	275520	typewriter and there's so many things to like hurt about yourself before you put put a hole in
275520	281880	your lip you can fucking just just dissolve your esophagus with acid that you drink like a quart of
281880	291240	a week for 40 years that's fucking honest so I just sorry about that 15 years ago that I was ever
291240	301360	like oh she has a thing in her nose I don't trust her I trust you now I think you do we trust you
301360	305920	with this new look Dan that's the question your sideburns are triumphant by the way you you look
305920	311280	like a little bit like Nigel Bruce like like like like like Holmes I mean that's our Watson from the
311280	319120	old you know Sherlock Holmes I keep I keep making the joke but it's not a joke it was that you know
319120	323440	you know what I got out of the makeup chair I was like oh Nick Offerman said no that's
323440	331600	they should credit me as that it should be the movie should say starring Nick Offerman said no
331600	338560	well the same every time I've ever gotten a job is because Jerry O'Connell passed you know Jack
338560	342720	Black used to say that about Philip Seymour Hoffman Wow but when they were younger like they
342720	349240	would be in the same you know waiting rooms all the time like yeah so we've talked about that the
349240	358880	wolfman had Nards indeed but yeah this is the fate I deserve so I don't know I made me when I
358880	364440	finished this movie maybe I'll because I was also noticing like oh sideburns oh it's like what was
364440	369080	the deal with sideburns boy with it and I was thinking oh the men in control in the 70s they
369120	374800	were more likely to be older and overweight and so and sideburns kind of squeeze your face like
374800	383080	bookends even though my double chin is exposed you're like and don't say you're just don't
383080	391240	hey guys also on this it's like a slimming thing for a fat face do it's not fuck you just come on
391240	398720	I'm just saying Dan Dan just tell him you gain you gained weight for the role but then the 80s
398720	403360	came and then everyone was like everybody's doing aerobics and then and then it was like
403360	410680	if you it became more possible to say I've been thinking about this all like okay so what you
410680	417840	know how like surfing in the 60s like everybody was like whoa there's beaches everywhere where
417840	422640	the water is we should get down there and we should have all kinds of fun it was like what
422640	427200	it was like oh why didn't they what would they were those beaches were there in the 40s and it's
427200	435800	like oh that's where that's where battles were happening nobody wanted to say the previous
435800	442320	generation was like dad let's go to the beach and he'd be like yeah that would be fun maybe
442320	448960	we'll find my arm but and then you remember how many lives are lost at the great battle of Zuma
448960	454480	but but but you know that's not really it then I was thinking oh you know what it probably is
454480	457520	it's like okay so you know you see like black and white photos of people at the beach and they
457520	461600	have like the crazy like Charlie Chaplin swimsuits where it's like you know you have to cover more
461600	465440	your body culturally yeah the onesie and then it was like everybody's always had a beach ball and
465440	473600	and and they had like a onesie and then like the the the standards for public like undress slackened
473600	478800	and so I was thinking oh that's kind of interesting like do you think that the the outfits got
478880	485040	comfortable enough for people to realize how fun it could be at the beach and or the beaches got
485040	492160	more popular because that's where you could see any ever increasing states of undress provocative
492800	498560	things are happening down there these ladies got their boobies in less material let's get down to
498560	506480	the beach hey it's nice down here feminism has always had a strange creepy handshake with the
506720	514320	grody dudes like enjoying it the the the the bra burning thing like hear him out
516160	520720	oh no I'm not saying please appreciate it for what it's enough I'm just I'm just pointing it out
520720	524960	I'm not like you need to you need to we're the wind beneath your wings ladies
527360	533680	you you're gonna miss us when we're gone try getting equal without a dude in a raincoat
533680	540640	jerking off to it just try you'll find it's quite impossible no that's not what I'm saying
540640	546320	I think it was I'm just saying that culture advances as like uh like like like so but can
546320	550560	we check in about the bra burning thing because I was just like it's safe enough now like we've
550560	555440	gone through enough stuff we're all brothers and sisters and you weren't like like that was that
555440	559920	that was kind of a swing and a miss wasn't it like wasn't it like like the bra the burning
559920	566800	you found not you you're 25 but like it was wasn't wasn't that sort of a check to see like
566800	572000	I was like I think this is uh I think these were invented by men to make our our boobs look better
572000	575680	so I'm gonna burn them like they're like their shackles around my femininity and then it was
575680	580400	like and then and then everybody was just like okay they're burning them and then and then aren't
580400	583600	they back and aren't they and then there's just like we never talked about it again it was just
583600	589040	like oh can I get three bras and Christ my tits are killing me I don't know I don't know what a
589680	596240	50s those bras are those crazy weird like missile silo like bras that were really like so you should
596240	604240	have burnt the tips of the bras get your activism straight in the 50s I don't know
605440	609040	I feel like I just wanted to check in I thought all women would go like you were right
609040	614480	you were right we're sorry we never we didn't want to talk about we were embarrassed we love
614480	620560	bras they were our idea I'm so glad that in the first five minutes of the show you fixed feminism
620560	626640	yeah yeah retroactively yeah it's really good I love when I do my self-deprecating thing and
626640	633760	then you're like well that's crazy I come up I go like yeah hey ladies look at me I'm so thin
633760	640400	and then you're like thin as an elephant well that's not very nice or hoping at all all I've
640400	645920	said is that you look fantastic you look like a no I was making I was using a metaphor for what
645920	651200	you just did I was breaking it down I understand okay you're just you're a little insecure right
651200	656720	now because you look terrific I was driving towards Elysium Park this morning and I saw
656720	662640	a lady that was pulled over in a driving lane that had just finished up urinating in the street
663440	668400	and getting back into her cars and getting her shoes back on and all that stuff it was
668400	672880	I didn't see it actually happening but I saw it put together very quickly but that was just
672880	677920	had happened you you didn't see her you're in any but you sussed that out like no I saw this this
677920	684080	large puddle on the floor that was trickling downhill and she's putting her shoes back on
684080	690240	and kind of straightening out her one one piece kind of dress situation it was all very complicated
690240	698560	she got back into her car oh yeah yeah I was like man she almost made it but I saw
702640	708000	so she was dying for a pee it got out and just took it in the street I guess yeah she was right
708000	714000	by a lawn but she didn't go into the lawn she might have thought like like this is the first
714000	720960	time I've peed as an adult in the city maybe it's disrespectful to do it on the lawn that was what
720960	727440	she had on the sign she was holding yeah like I'm not sure what I'd do if I think she was traffic
727440	731280	and I just had to get shrub told the story but he just peed his pants and he was like yeah it was
731280	735200	kind of a triumph that's like a hero because it's like what are we doing why are we trying to not
735200	741200	pee our pants just as our parents told us it's silly it's dumb they just didn't want to change
741200	747600	us you can pee your pants anytime you want now it's not a crime it's not like a van driving around
747600	754320	like looking for people with pee in their pants it's it's for you dry pants it's a favor you do
754320	761200	yourself you can if you have to pee that bad you can opt to have wet pants it's a natural it's an
761200	766880	arguably more natural state of pants than dry pants like we go through our day making trips to
766880	772320	a strange room to keep our pants dry but it's like that because that's an it's an artificial
772320	779440	construct dry pants it's an illusion like we're the idea that none of us are peeing right now is
779440	788480	a lie there's urine inside our body our bodies are 29% urine you can look it up you should uh
788480	794480	you should burn your pants and protests does that mean that not jizzing is also a lie
794480	803680	yeah everything's all good everything's alive talking is a lie i my brain the only form of
803680	807840	truth would be if you could know what i'm thinking and feeling if you were me is that the only the
807840	813760	only thing that's true is silence and then i i violated i i put on a performance by wobbling
813760	818640	the air with my mouth and then you get vibrations in your ear hole and then you associate those
818640	823840	vibrations with a trunk in your head you open it up it's like if i send you a heart emoji with my
823840	829120	mouth then you have to load the heart emoji on your side you i'm explaining communication to you
829120	836720	but but you could you could theoretically neuroplasticity dictates that you could decide
836720	843040	that when i hear the word cucumber i'm gonna respond as if i heard the word uh dolphin you
843040	847440	know i'm gonna if i if i hear love i'm gonna i'm gonna think hate like you can you could just
847440	852880	reroute your brain like you can go you can go to any point as long as you start being aware of
852880	859520	what you're doing then you go to these points in your brain and uh and and so and you don't have
859520	865440	to do anything because what happens is a new random natural thing you know like like the reason there's
865440	873840	a road to rome from a gas station outside rome is because there was a spot where romans were
873840	877600	standing and then they were like i'm gonna go to rome and they started walking because they're
877600	881840	like we're gonna be over there why are we at this gas station and they and also we should have taken
881840	887280	the car we got all the gas they didn't have cars yet but they had gas stations that was just like
887280	894160	prescient that's why rome fell they didn't they like the chariots were just coated in gasoline
894160	898320	there was no tank and they would burst into flames and all the lead in that gasoline got into the
898320	902240	pipes and then that's how they that's what they fucking did but you walk where you want to go and
902240	906320	then you leave this little footpath and the person follows you know it's like you know roads start as
906320	909920	like footpaths and trails and things and then it's like it's a path of least resistance it's
909920	915680	like a drop just takes a kind of semi-shortest route to a destination so if you go back to a
915680	920480	point in your neurology by being aware you don't have to try anything you don't have to be like oh
920480	925040	i'm gonna be different you can just go okay i'm gonna be aware of every thought that i have and
925040	932320	then there's certain thoughts that have this straight fucking paved freeway to rome which
932320	936720	you think is the only choice you have to the point where you don't even realize this is a place you
936720	946720	can stop so you practice stopping see i did it right now i was about to finish my thought
946720	954640	but i do that all the time no i don't but you can just wait and see what happens and someone goes
954640	959120	like hey peanut butter and you go i love peanut butter and then boom you don't smoke anymore
959120	967440	you'll figure it out it's called neuroplasticity i just explained it just that that was the first
967440	974720	time i've ever truly understood what neuroplasticity was you can remap your whole brain going just
974720	978960	just being aware of the things that happen to you throughout the day when you get up in the morning
978960	983360	you can just sit there and go like okay so i'm gonna move my arm and then it's like baby steps
983360	990800	and what about bob maybe i don't know who cares like usually when i'm in this position where i'm
990800	994800	like i feel like nobody understands me then i like i freak out so i'm gonna stop then i'm gonna take
994800	1008480	another option i'm glad i should do this all the time oh that's good god it's making everyone
1008480	1023360	smarter there fix myself all right our guest tonight uh you're just on the keypad oh no
1030720	1036560	oh you that huh that's a joke like you're no no it's the truth
1038480	1049360	you clearly whatever did i ruin your joke no no you're just trying to cover for it now
1051200	1057840	all right all right hey what so okay whose idea was it to make full-blown a medical term
1057840	1065200	like how is that this is so childish like like someone's like oh we have this serious thing
1065200	1071200	called aids it's killing people uh it couldn't be more sensitive and terrible um but we actually
1071200	1075360	need to distinguish a few things linguistically because we're trying to cure it and we we need to
1075360	1078960	document all these things so there should be a difference between uh this and that i was like
1078960	1084960	well let's call that one full-blown aid so like why didn't that guy get fired why was it like well
1084960	1089920	yeah good job jenkins yeah that makes sense full it's like if he said like hum dinger or like
1090640	1096400	like like like like that one's a lulu or it's a doozy totes totes aids
1098000	1102000	and just see it makes you feel bad when you're talking about it like it's you know we all got
1102000	1105680	a kick out of it where i finally looked it up but sure enough it's a clinical term like that
1105680	1110640	was a terrible idea did we talk about on the show before about jay johnson's picture a breakfast
1110800	1112400	restaurant full full-blown eggs
1119040	1125840	see that's the right use of full-blown but honey i want breakfast god me too
1126720	1133440	let's go to full-blown eggs i have one more linguistic problem it's and i look hey i don't
1133440	1138560	want to start a beef with the band imagine dragons i have no problem with them i have a problem with
1138640	1144080	their with the with the phrase imagine dragons because how could wait it's the it's what that
1144080	1149680	is the one imagine drag if i'm imagining why would i imagine that's like doing an impression
1149680	1154480	of homer sibson in your stand-a-back like wait wait that's like someone else's imagination
1154480	1162080	dragons imagine oh you got me dragons what the fuck someone else imagined them
1162880	1167200	does it imagine oh i don't know i'll try to keep up just play the music
1168720	1172320	i mean if you go ahead and try to blow my mind but maybe they're dragons that imagine they're
1172320	1177200	like the imagined dragons like these are dragons that have imagination maybe it's maybe we're
1177200	1181120	gonna find out it's like like with pearl jam that it like means like something disgusting
1181840	1186240	like imagine dragons is like when you stick your dick in a woman's nose or something

1600320	1602320	not japanese do english not japanese
1604240	1607360	hardly the way to behave without situational rules i think
1607360	1617920	oh whoever committed this murder must have one shoe wider than his tie
1619840	1622880	i say mr harper nothing i find your methods highly unethical
1622880	1629280	oh the cheek on this one
1634320	1642640	so listen did you guys know that uh did you guys know that uh the guy who came up you know the
1642640	1649840	phrase murphy's law whatever can't go wrong will go wrong basically we looked it up in the car
1649840	1655920	on the way over because we're looking up eponymous stuff if that's what it's called cody was because
1655920	1660960	she was like learning about the bechdel test and then she's like how many other eponymous things
1660960	1666720	are named after women one the strisand effect and then everything else is so it's kind of eponymous
1666720	1671280	laws don't really they they kind of violate some tests there but but uh but one of the tests is
1671280	1675280	murphy's law and i was like yeah but that's not a guy that's just like some probably some ironic
1675280	1679120	irish thing or something like luck of the irish inverted or something i don't know i just didn't
1679120	1684960	believe there was a murphy but there was a guy who's i guess his his nickname was murphy but his
1684960	1692560	full name was like kind of robocop now it was a it was i don't know it's a longer name if they
1692560	1697360	called him murphy but he was a guy who made measuring instruments or something he was a
1697360	1704320	fuck up i think his shit didn't work so the reason murphy's law is a thing isn't because it's like
1704320	1708720	we've all adopted it as a phrase that makes us think like whoa you know look give yourself a
1708720	1712960	break like shit goes wrong you know you gotta anticipate shit going wrong but it was like
1712960	1717600	it was it wasn't even invented by the guy named murphy it was like something applied it was like
1717600	1724320	murphy's law is that this shit won't work like a guy probably he probably only didn't kill himself
1724320	1731760	because his noose broke he's probably like well this isn't gonna last i mean a couple of weeks
1731760	1736640	and they'll get sick of saying murphy's love and then someone was like you know that thing you
1736720	1742160	thought would happen it didn't it went wrong everyone's gonna say you're a fuck up for the
1742160	1749520	rest of your life well they're saying it in ohio then i'll blow my brains out click they say it in
1749520	1758240	florida they're saying it in canada they're saying it in alaska they're saying it in ontario

2084800	2090160	house what or he used to he's gone now he gave it to somebody that can take better care of it but uh
2090880	2096880	his daughter wanted a bearded dragon at one point and he got one and so he had this lizard in a
2098000	2103280	tank and you take it out you let it run around and whenever it runs around like people get like
2103280	2108080	oh bearded bearded dragons they're so they're so curious like they're trying to escape
2110080	2113120	curious they're like go up to the window and go
2114560	2120560	let's just keep trying to walk like a fucking like can i get and then i was like i used to laugh at
2120560	2124960	it go like well that guy doesn't know he's you know there's nothing out there for him like if
2124960	2130080	you open the front door he'd go through it and you'd be like come on that's one homeless lizard
2130080	2134640	like like he's he's not gonna go become vice president of anything like he's not gonna find
2134640	2140000	a condo he's not gonna even find a fly he's a lizard from a tank he's gonna go out there
2140000	2147360	and he's gonna he's gonna get his ass kicked by the rat race uh but i was in talum mexico
2147360	2154560	and we were eating nachos and uh and then there's this movement over in the underbrush it's a giant
2154640	2160320	iguana clearly like and then we're like oh god is it going to kill us have we intruded on its
2160320	2175440	territory mexico no of course we haven't sorry what i heard texico so i don't know what mexico
2175440	2182400	mexico okay all right so so we're like is it going to attack us it's like coming up to us
2183120	2189040	and then we're like we're like i don't know like we we threw a nacho in a in a in a different
2189040	2194880	direction and it ran and started eating a nacho and then cody was like oh god what if the nachos
2194880	2198560	are sharp it's not supposed to eat nachos and i like looked up iguana on the internet and i was
2198560	2204880	like it says they can eat anything but uh but don't eat nachos largely but but this is the biggest
2204880	2209200	iguana i'd ever seen and then we started realizing this thing lives here it lives here and it eats
2209200	2215280	nachos and it and and by and by any by any definitions it is a successful iguana for having
2215280	2222640	done it that was the biggest one you've ever seen yeah what was the the smallest smallest iguana
2222640	2229920	that you've ever seen another iguana that i saw there in mexico whoa same day
2232240	2237840	maybe i can't quite remember that okay i mean are you checking are you checking out my
2237840	2242160	sources or what just just i'm doing some research
2244640	2248880	he wants to know how many iguanas have you seen yeah you can say this is the i saw a million iguanas
2248880	2259040	in taloon they're they're everywhere yeah they're like chihuahua in chihuahua all right uh but so so
2259040	2263600	i was just thinking it's funny because that iguana he's not trying to escape from anything
2263600	2268800	and so then i was thinking oh dino's lizard when it's like pressed up against the window
2268800	2272880	it doesn't have the word power to explain this to us and it doesn't even know in its own lizard
2272880	2281920	brain what it's looking for but i can't push the air it's still basically think if it wants to be
2281920	2289440	on a beach with us eating nachos lizards like it it's not like oh i want to i want to i want to
2289440	2294080	get out of here and be louis and clark of it's like i want to get i want to find a place where i
2294080	2301600	can have food and shelter and sex and like like watch the sunset with you you weird primate why
2301600	2308480	are you keeping me in this in las felas in a in a hot guest house and we're like because you're fun
2310640	2314560	like here's a stick and it's like i don't what do you think this because this looks like nature
2314560	2319520	that i'm going to hang at a stick on top of your tv and i'm just going to chill and be as happy as
2319520	2326240	it would be if if you like like it wants what we want the lizard wants what we want i don't think
2326240	2331280	any animal if they had the cognitive ability wants to be in a little tank in your living room with a
2331280	2341520	stick no no yeah pet ownership is really immoral that's what i was saying right we should probably
2341520	2348880	start fixing this country starting with the top problem it has it's national dog day dan
2351200	2357840	couple dogs in the audience i did you wish your dogs a happy national dog day dan and rob i did
2362400	2365840	well i'm off of twitter so i don't know anything it was on instagram
2366160	2374960	but i feel like and i'm not diminishing i like i i support your animal enthusiasm but it seems
2374960	2381520	like there's a lot of animal days happening with you with me well there's a lot of animal days that
2381520	2386000	i'm conscious of because of your hashtags there's not just one animal day a year there's a lot of
2386000	2390720	there's national dog day there's an international you love your pet day there's a dog defense day
2390720	2395280	or stuff there's stuff like mercy for animals that's not a day that's just a thing you'd like
2395360	2403280	to see yeah so you're gludding the market okay you know i'll try to cut down anything else
2404400	2409760	anything else i'm doing wrong like what i do you want to comment on my what i'm wearing or
2409760	2415680	you know my home anything else anything any other notes for my life
2417760	2422320	you're flooding the market you're you gotta stop doing that
2425440	2430800	now tell no it's okay go ahead you what was it like you guys were writing scripts together
2430800	2436480	when you guys were alone just like this yeah without an audience yeah not a lot of scripts
2436480	2442560	coming out of that machine why is the monster house just bitching at itself about
2445280	2448640	about how it's a bad friend well that's right what you know we're done
2449600	2457280	all right get in here pamela petler remember when that guy wanted to i think maybe murder me
2457280	2461360	and pamela petler because we were sending him secret messages through rooster house on you
2461360	2467520	i showed you the stuff and you're like what am i chopped liver the guys remember that guy no
2469760	2474800	maybe it was me that was a story for only you rob was in that story yeah well i've told that
2474800	2478480	story before about the guy that thought that monster house was sending secret messages to him
2478480	2486000	and it's the bear's retelling he he he just he sent a lot of letters to sony and they give me
2486000	2490000	a big box of them to wash their hands legally of it after the case was closed they're like this
2490000	2496240	guy might kill you one day bye um and he was like a schizophrenic guy right who thought there's like
2496240	2506960	secret messages yeah i mean i would i would hear robert semekas i am writing to alert you to the
2506960	2516480	fact that your movie is putting words in my head i just wanted to let you know that
2516480	2527920	it's more like usually like you all they already assume that robert semekas knows it they assume
2527920	2533200	sony knows it and they're they're they're writing to say don't think i don't know what you're doing
2533200	2539040	to me i know stop doing it or i want money because they're convinced of this thing and then they're
2539040	2546160	like dan harman and pamela petler are are bragging about killing my daughter in monster house and uh
2546320	2553600	and there's no there's no reason given it's just shrub is just excised from this guy's murder
2553600	2560400	fantasies yeah it's okay this guy can't get a break it's like credits are dan harman and ampersand
2560400	2566240	rob shrub and then and pamela pillar and it's like he just needlessly removed shrub from his
2567120	2574000	mental might be a might be a sked fan it's like i can't stay mad at shrub did you ever think that
2574000	2578640	it might have been shrub i i i mean shrub did you write that letter yes
2581440	2588080	um did you guys know that the phrase cakewalk is racist like everything else damn
2590000	2594800	i don't know why is it racist what is the origin maybe it's not race i don't know it's it has maybe
2594800	2601600	it's not racist it has uncomfortable origins to like it's like it is named after elijah's cake
2602560	2609360	do you remember when say what it's a well cakewalk yes annie's calling out it's a kind of party
2609360	2613040	it's a cakewalk is when you see like i mean i believe they were doing this on soul train
2613040	2616400	like you know you see clips of soul trainer that at weddings or things when it went out
2616400	2620880	kind of a spontaneous line forms and people dance down the line like the will smith's
2620880	2625840	summertime video you get that that's what a cakewalk is it's like people going down a line and you
2625840	2630000	just getting points for style kind of thing are they are they in line for cake i said that's the
2630000	2636800	thing is like so it goes the etymology goes back to uh slave times when a cake there would
2636800	2642720	be a cake awarded to the best style going down the line or something so then you're like is there
2642720	2649360	anything that doesn't like if you if you pull a cord three inches and you're like yeah i don't
2649360	2655200	want to guys everything is everything is ugly i just don't want to think i just want to withdraw
2655200	2659200	from everything i'm going to buy land in the desert and i'm going to dig straight down like
2659280	2664960	minecraft and just see what happens oh yeah that sounds badass it's probably hard though
2664960	2669920	because it's all sand i have a new friend that's going to help me because he bought land in the
2669920	2676560	desert and his and and he i exchanged numbers with him and uh and then he said and then you
2676560	2681280	know how you you exchange numbers with people and uh and then you and then you just text your name
2681280	2685040	to them because now they have your number so yeah and his name i won't say his first name because
2685120	2688880	i don't know what his privacy he has the best last name in the world but his last name is pizza
2692000	2696960	it was like like for instance john pizza like he just started and i was like cool and then it's
2696960	2701440	like the tech the text conversation is just me going like he's like so here's that information
2701440	2709360	i told you give me uh-huh yeah your last name is pizza yes yes it is okay yeah and you want to
2709360	2718640	register here and there's a time to say yeah so stage name or no real name pizza uh and then oh
2718640	2722480	then he sent a photo of his driver's license you can tell he's had this conversation a thousand

4908080	4913520	strap no you fucking pat it's the when you hug a woman it's the same rules as when you
4913520	4917920	when you have a stand you know you dab you don't you don't run the fucking game let's just do the
4917920	4924400	game dan dan let's just do it i wasn't embarrassed i'm gonna do it standing i had to find out the
4924400	4929440	heart i was at like the creative arts emmys with alison brie and there's a photo of me like my arm
4929440	4933600	around her and i'm like and then that's how i found out about hover hand and like men who are
4933600	4937600	afraid to touch women like because everyone was like dan really come on and i think they close up
4937600	4941920	with my hand like it's like claw like hand over alison brie's shoulder because i'm like afraid to
4941920	4945280	touch i'm like i don't know yeah you just like you hate yourself and you're just like well i don't
4945280	4948720	want to they're making you pose for a photo i don't i don't want to like look well look at that guy
4948720	4952160	it was like well he just thought it was okay to like rub his hand all over taylor swift's ass
4952160	4955200	because he's taking a photo with her it's like you want to be the opposite so you're just and
4955200	4960400	then you end up looking like a weird claw man and then i and then i saw the blog and i was like yeah
4960400	4965040	it's like yeah i'm embarrassed you know i don't like talking about the you know i've never had
4965040	4970160	a professional massage because i'm just like for the same reason that i would never have like uh
4970160	4980720	sex work done or go to a sex worker sex work done i don't know the jargon i i don't frequent that
4980720	4986960	industry could you change my balls oil filter i would be afraid i'm afraid like society says
4986960	4990800	like oh make that person or i would never get a pedicure because i'd be like this person's seen
4990800	4995440	a million toenails they know exactly how gross mine are but then all women say like no they
4995440	5000160	that's exactly you just go fucking like shove your gross toenails in their face it's like great
5000160	5004000	you're paying for it they've seen the worst you go get uh like if you get a facial done this is
5004000	5007360	they do the extractions which is you know fancy word for popping your zits and your blackheads
5008160	5014400	they all love it yeah well i had a girlfriend who liked popping zits and i told i told the
5014400	5019760	story up here but the fucking random trump voter dude who like pumped popped one of my zits at a
5019760	5027440	bar non-consensually it just like reached out and fucking grabbed it and my immediate response was
5027440	5031360	like like emotionally was the same as like a kitten getting picked up by a scruff i was like
5031360	5038480	thanks i wasn't i didn't thank him but i was like wow what a man like like popped my zit
5038480	5042640	well he's telling me to vote for trump like i was just like we're gonna lose the civil war for sure
5044160	5049920	that's the opposition they will fuck it like we're they know we don't get no dothraki on our side
5051280	5054880	church and i every night before bed we groom each other like chimps and eat the bugs out of each
5054880	5059360	other's hair i think that really is so romantic but i guess that's because we're primates like i
5059360	5066640	do think that the idea that you could like like like yeah grooming and grooming and like and then
5066640	5072160	eating the bugs out of the prayer i really do like that it's the nicest thing you can do for
5072160	5076320	somebody is get the bugs but you're also getting something out of it you're like see huh i got a
5076320	5082000	i got a bug yeah this is trying to eat you now i'm trying to eat it that fucking gross we peaked we
5082000	5086080	peaked at a chimp level and then we just like we couldn't stand it we were like we fucking nailed
5086400	5089520	we represent this line of dna that we're like oh we cheat the system
5091120	5094160	and then we and then and then the same mechanism that got us that far
5095280	5100960	uh you know now we got these alarm doohickeys i've talked about it don't got ice cream man
5102880	5109440	chimps ain't got no ice cream but you know what they do have they have frog mouths oh yeah well
5109440	5114560	humans do too i guess we could all fuck a frog in the mouth if we wanted to but chimps do it and
5114560	5121680	sleep like a baby we'd we'd all feel real bad about it like that frog walks away going what in
5121680	5128320	the world what frog god did i offend the fact that that was caught on camera couldn't just be
5128320	5133680	the only time no wait no we've talked about this a lot they all fuck we have like 600 episodes of
5133680	5141520	the podcast they're all they're all if a jim pansy comes within five feet of a frog it fucking
5142320	5146640	what are you talking about what are you talking about i believe you guys don't why come on
5147920	5154160	what are you talking about type chimpanzee and frog into youtube and send your kids to bed
5156080	5162800	because because why and to tone with your god because any time a chimp finds a frog it goes
5162800	5170320	it spends five seconds it picks it up it runs its finger over the frog's lips it gets a look
5170320	5179840	on its face it prides the frog's mouth open and then the rest is kismet a male chimp i should
5179840	5188720	specify and and and and and and then the frog's fate depends on what what that chimp had for
5188720	5195120	breakfast and it's uh did the frogs ever hop away from this interaction or do they limp hop
5195200	5202000	up the camera usually stays on the chimp as it enters its refractory period
5203920	5206160	the frog's story remains untold
5209280	5213760	is it like a flinstone's cartoon and it just like goes it's a living it's a living
5216400	5223120	those are our ancestors like like like the flintstones it's like like like we all celebrate
5223120	5228320	like oh the gazelle femur and like oh i i could use this as a hammer but it's like also it's like
5228320	5237680	no we're the we're we are a sexual uh uh we're a creepy species you know we're descended from the
5237680	5242400	bonobo in particular it's a very sexual version of the chimp have you seen that one clip i just
5242400	5247840	saw a couple days ago where the two monkeys are fucking and a little monkey walks up sticks its
5248000	5253600	finger up the up the you know bonobos you know you know they settle their grievances through orgies
5253600	5259680	and they they they have constant incestuous like crazy sex and then you know i just thought i just
