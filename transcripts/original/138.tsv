0	9520	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, alert now, Peter Hormontown is now in session.
9520	20640	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hormontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
20640	34560	Thank you so much, such kind people, you're such warm hearted, supportive people, you
34560	40920	put a lot of faith in me, I don't want to let you down, but it won't be a good show
40920	41920	tonight.
41920	43160	It's not going to be a good show.
43160	44160	Why is that?
44160	53040	I'm busy, and I'm tired, and not very talented, and I don't make plans, and then I come up
53040	55800	on stage and it's like, what am I going to talk about, I don't know what I'm going to
55800	56800	talk about.
56800	58440	In case of why, Dan, I disagree with you about tonight's show, I think it's going to be a
58440	62960	good one, because tonight you're drinking out of glass as opposed to a red solo cup,
62960	66760	and I think that automatically steps up the class factor.
66760	69760	I think I wrote one thing in my notepad.
69760	71760	See, I knew it.
71760	79880	Oh, there is a surprise later tonight, going to take his dick out.
79880	86320	By the way, Dan, while you're looking that up, people that play music and like music,
86320	89840	because we can't play licensed music anymore, I have to play stuff that people either donate
89840	93520	to us or that is free so that we don't get in trouble now that we're charging people.
93520	98160	So if you want to, or you know somebody that plays music and wants to play something kickass
98160	106920	to start off the show, go to harmontownmusic.tumblr.com and all the info will be there to have a
106920	109440	song that we can play to start off the show and play throughout the show.
109440	114960	So if you know somebody, please give it, because that song is by a band called Knife to Meet
114960	115960	You.
115960	116960	Oh.
116960	117960	Knife.
117960	118960	Real Knife.
118960	119960	Real Knife.
120760	121760	Real Knife.
121760	128040	Yeah, that's Harold Knife and his girlfriend.
128040	131040	Cindy Meets.
131040	134040	See?
134040	135040	Cindy Meets?
135040	137720	You thought I was being self-deprecating.
137720	138720	I'm just a journalist.
138720	140720	Why are you so tired, huh?
140720	141720	I'm working.
141720	144120	I'm going to go back to the office after this.
144120	147520	I'm lock in episode 604.
147520	149520	Take us through the last 48 hours of your life.
150080	155320	Well, I went to Yahoo in San Jose over the weekend.
155320	161720	They had us come out, I think it was Friday, we went and flew to San Jose and then drove
161720	168160	to this weird spaceship in the middle of the desert where these thousands and thousands
168160	174360	of Yahoo people like work and it's crazy over there and they had, you know, it was just
174360	177160	like sort of like a drop in to there.
177160	183440	They have like a fireside chat every Friday where the CEO, Marissa Meyer, like conducts
183440	190320	this like whole thing and you can Reddit style, you can like type in, I think anonymous questions
190320	191800	and they get upvoted or downvoted.
191800	196560	It's sort of like a closed circuit Reddit for AMA that she does every week.
196560	200320	So if you have like a beef with your paycheck or something, you can like, like, what the
200320	201320	fuck's with my paycheck?
201320	204800	And if everyone's like, yeah, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?
204800	206520	And she'll be like, oh, what the fuck's up with the paycheck?
206520	209160	Okay, so here's the thing.
209160	216240	You don't get one, but listen, I don't know, you get a free email address.
216240	222480	Look under your seat, and it's so it's like that so that we, they have like guests that
222480	226200	are like people that work at different departments come up and do this thing and it's all like
226200	229040	a big kind of pump you up Yahoo thing.
229040	234800	They have purple beer, I'm boring myself.
234800	236200	The purple beer is really good.
236200	238160	I have nothing bad to say about Yahoo.
238160	241520	Is it purple for a reason or is it just dyed purple because it's called?
241520	243360	It was made with blueberries or something.
243360	246800	So I think it's there's some purple that's justified, but I think overall probably they
246800	249160	just put cancerous dye in it, right?
249160	253760	I mean, I don't think anything, anything that's supposed to be a color is ever that
253760	254760	color.
254760	262880	I'm just saying like when things are orange, because you feel like they should be orange,
262880	270120	they're not usually orange like, like, you know, we rarely, you know, see things the
270120	275560	way somebody told me that we're, that air conditioning in the air conditioning industry,
275560	281040	like there's a worldwide conspiracy to make the 69 degrees in your car either warmer or
281040	286760	colder than real 69 degrees because human beings have a certain temperature that they
286760	293040	think is 69 degrees and it doesn't match what's real 69 degrees.
293040	297360	Somebody told me that when we were doing the AC repair things in community.
297360	305320	Anyways, the, our movie was just broke on Netflix and you can tell because, yes, please
305320	306880	Netflix is here.
307640	311320	I mean, is that, is that why you're drinking out of a glass?
311320	316760	Well, you can tell from the volume of tweets of people saying, I just watched the Harman
316760	317760	town documentary.
317760	319040	It kind of really shot up.
319040	323200	I don't think Netflix is, I think they got a real, a real sizable lemonade stand going
323200	324200	over there.
324200	325200	I don't know.
325200	330720	I think they, I think they might be flicks in some nets.
330720	334920	I think they might, they might, they might, they might, they might have some, some viewership
334920	343160	that Netflix is, is Sydney meets there?
343160	344160	Sydney meets.
344160	345160	All right.
345160	347640	So are you, are you almost through the woods with a community?
347640	350000	Are you, are you almost through with the writing?
350000	351000	Yeah.
351000	354200	But why don't you play the, play the family song?
354200	355200	Family songs.
355200	356200	I'll get my own.
356200	366200	From the day I went to you, I knew it was true.
366200	375200	And I saw your eyes and you knew what you saw was true.
375200	383200	Family, you are what we need.
384200	393200	Family, you are what we need.
393200	400200	Family, you are what we need.
400200	409200	Family, you are what we need.
410200	413200	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
413200	415200	Was M.C. John about to come out?
415200	417200	Was M.C. John about to come out?
417200	418200	Seemed like it.
418200	419200	Seemed like it.
419200	420200	You got to start over though.
420200	421200	You got to start over.
421200	422200	But here's the thing with that song though.
422200	424200	It starts right on the nugget.
424200	428200	And then I start a measure in, I don't know if, do you call it a measure?
428200	429200	Or a bar.
429200	430200	A bar.
430200	433200	And then I'm always, I can tell from the music that I'm a bar off.
433200	434200	You know what I mean?
434200	435200	Because I'm like doing my set up.
435200	437200	It goes like one, two, three, four.
437200	438200	It starts right on the one.
438200	440200	So that's a toughie.
440200	442200	Whoever wrote that song, you failed.
442200	446200	Let it go four or eight bars before you jump in.
446200	447200	Really?
447200	448200	So go like, yeah.
448200	450200	Like just, you know, hype it up for a bit.
450200	452200	Okay, so it's like, so you start it.
452200	453200	Okay, let's try it out.
453200	454200	Okay.
456200	457200	Yeah.
457200	458200	All right.
458200	459200	Here we go.
459200	460200	Are you ready?
460200	461200	Check it out.
461200	462200	Oh, so I start there?
462200	463200	Yeah, sure.
464200	465200	Okay.
465200	468200	I thought four would be like four, two more.
468200	469200	You could do four or eight.
469200	472200	As long as it's two, there's a factor of two, I'm okay.
472200	475200	You want to start at the end of a measure, right?
475200	476200	Okay.
476200	477200	Because it just seems, okay, let's try it.
477200	478200	Let me try it.
478200	479200	Okay, you ready?
479200	480200	Okay, here we go.
484200	485200	Eight.
485200	488200	One, two, three, four, five, six.
489200	494200	When the morning sun comes up, I go to school.
495200	496200	See?
496200	497200	No, see?
497200	498200	You hear that?
498200	499200	No, did you hear it?
499200	500200	Did you hear it?
500200	501200	It didn't resolve, Ethan.
501200	502200	No, no, you were right in it.
502200	503200	You were right in it.
503200	505200	No, but I said, go to school.
505200	508200	And it was like, like, it was like, you're done.
508200	510200	Like, you're done with that thought.
510200	512200	Okay, then let it turn all the way around there.
512200	513200	It's four?
513200	515200	Okay, let's hear it.
515200	516200	For four?
516200	517200	All right.
519200	520200	Okay, yeah.
520200	521200	You can fill that time with speed.
521200	528200	When I go to school, I like to learn.
528200	535200	I think about the things you should not burn.
535200	536200	No, okay.
536200	537200	Let's do it again.
537200	538200	Okay.
538200	539200	Let's do it again.
539200	540200	Okay.
540200	541200	Let's do it again.
541200	542200	Okay.
542200	543200	Okay.
543200	544200	Let's do it again.
544200	545200	Okay.
545200	546200	Let's do it again.
546200	547200	Okay.
547200	549200	Let's do it again.
549200	550200	How about this?
550200	551200	How about this?
551200	553200	When it starts, just start.
553200	554200	Even if you have to...
554200	557200	Let's try that, but I'm not always going to be able to do that.
557200	558200	Let's just see if that works.
558200	559200	Even if it's bullshit.
559200	562200	Just like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
562200	563200	All right.
563200	564200	Just jump in.
564200	565200	Okay, okay.
565200	566200	Sorry.
566200	567200	Go ahead.
567200	568200	Try it.
568200	569200	The question, do you want a topic?
569200	570200	No, no.
570200	571200	This is about joy.
571200	572200	This is about joy.
572200	574200	This song makes me happy.
574200	575200	Okay.
575200	577200	I just sing from my heart.
577200	581320	Kevin McLeod, if you're out there, come to Harman Town and visit the show because he's
581320	582320	really become a celebrity.
582320	583320	Yeah.
583320	586200	I think we all agree that this is the greatest song of all time.
586200	587200	Okay.
587200	588200	All right.
588200	590200	So now, the thing is, as soon as this kicks in, just dive in.
590200	591200	Right.
591200	592200	So I can even try to count you in.
592200	593200	A one, two, a three, a four.
593200	595200	Three, two, a three, a four.
624200	625200	Okay.
625200	626200	I got you.
626200	627200	Get to ground round.
627200	628200	It's a restaurant in the Midwest.
628200	629200	Family.
629200	630200	You okay?
630200	631200	Watch your way.
631200	632200	Ground round.
632200	633200	Pay what you weigh.
633200	636200	It's a mean thing to do to affect you today.
636200	637200	Commentary.
637200	640200	I had to ground round.
640200	643200	You threw me off meter.
643200	646200	I have big fat John.
646200	648200	I'm MC John's brother.
648200	652200	I'm anxious about my weight and I'm not as good a rapper.
652200	653200	Thank you.
653200	664200	When you go down to the house, you bring a key, beep, beep, toot, toot.
664200	667200	Bring a key to your house and you get your loot.
667200	672200	I want you to go inside for you.
672200	678200	Beep, beep, beep, choo, choo, choo, choo, choo.
678200	681200	You are all I need.
681200	684200	Beep, beep, beep, choo, choo, choo, choo.
684200	686200	What is our show?
686200	688200	What are we doing?
693200	694200	Okay.
694200	695200	You're right.
695200	696200	You're right.
696200	699200	If you were a new viewer, you would be upset.
699200	702200	One thing for certain, that was certainly about Joy.
702200	705200	I have some questions about big fat John, MC John's brother.
705200	706200	Oh, it's so sad.
706200	709200	Why are they both named John?
709200	711200	I think that his parents were like...
711200	714200	Are they full siblings or step brothers?
714200	719200	I think that big fat John, I think they're full on genetic siblings,
719200	723200	but their parents are just so mean that big fat John got born and they're like,
723200	725200	let's try again.
725200	727200	Wait, so MC John's the younger brother?
727200	728200	Yeah.
728200	729200	Yeah.
729200	732200	And big fat John is like first and then they were just like laid him aside
732200	735200	and they said, you're going to watch us do this right.
735200	738200	Wait, the parents made...
738200	742200	How old was MC John when they made him watch the parents have sex again?
742200	743200	Five.
743200	744200	So he's five years old.
744200	746200	The parents said, watch us fuck.
746200	748200	We're going to build a new John.
748200	749200	Right.
749200	750200	A good one, an MC.
750200	752200	They didn't know he was going to be fat.
752200	754200	No, big fat John's watching.
754200	756200	So they're building MC John.
756200	757200	Did they know?
757200	759200	Did they hope that he would be an MC or is that just an accident?
759200	762200	Yeah, I think they wanted to make an MC.
763200	764200	Or a lawn keeper.
764200	766200	Like if you could make that change.
766200	768200	They wanted him to be a...
768200	770200	Maybe it's a family of gardeners.
770200	773200	So then the irony is that big fat John was like, you're too fat to garden.
773200	776200	We're going to make a great John.
776200	780200	Then they made a John that was a good MC, but who is like...
780200	782200	He toes the family line.
782200	785200	Like he's like, I like to mow the lawn, but really he's an MC.
785200	786200	I don't know.
786200	787200	Is John...
787200	788200	Is that too complicated?
788200	791200	Is big fat John at heart a better gardener than MC John?
791200	794200	Well, obviously our heart goes out to big fat John.
794200	795200	He's the...
795200	799200	He's the dinklage of this Game of Thrones.
799200	805200	We all know what it feels like to be like, you know, a misfit and like not, not, not loved.
805200	810200	I mean, I admire his courage to even step into the MC, like the rapping milieu.
810200	812200	Well, I think he was thrust into it.
812200	814200	I think that was actually a really awkward situation.
814200	817200	Like someone mistook him for his brother and shoved him in and he was like,
817200	819200	I'm big fat John, I don't rap.
819200	820200	I think that was sad.
820200	822200	I thought that was sad.
822200	823200	Is he much fatter?
823200	824200	Is he so fat?
824200	826200	No, he's a regular size.
826200	830200	It's just a horrible world with a bad body image.
830200	833200	Like a regular size person with a normal metabolism, you know,
833200	841200	it's like he just has grown up in a world of Cindy Crawford billboards dating myself.
841200	845200	Whoever your Cindy Crawford is, hologram Crawford.
845200	847200	This new generation.
847200	848200	Cindy meat.
849200	852200	It's probably a porpoise fucking weirdos.
852200	855200	Have you got a new porn fetish?
855200	857200	Like it used to be like,
857200	864200	Yeah, I got married and then I was just like, I'm going to scratch some new itches.
864200	869200	I don't, I don't mean like, I mean like, you know, is it still stockings and nipples,
869200	870200	rubins and things like that?
870200	872200	Mannequins and whatnot.
872200	874200	First of all, everyone likes their nipples rubbed.
874200	876200	I don't like my nipples rubbed.
877200	879200	I rub them right.
882200	884200	Why don't you come over and rub my nipples?
884200	886200	I don't want to rub your nipples.
886200	890200	One time I was wearing some socks that were like sheer and I showed you them and you touched them
890200	892200	and you're like, whoa.
892200	894200	Because you're like, what am I doing?
894200	895200	This is my thing.
895200	896200	I like to rub stockings.
896200	898200	Oh, you were wearing socks that were like kind of nylon.
898200	900200	Yeah. And you were like, whoa, what the hell?
900200	902200	Yeah, that's a tricky one.
903200	910200	I get, I get mad when like, yeah, I like people wear things that I'm like, oh, that's my fetish.
910200	913200	But it's like, but you're, you're not, you're not my wife.
913200	918200	And also, you work at a bank.
919200	920200	So what's, what's the look?
920200	921200	What's the what?
921200	923200	What's the look? What's the outfit?
924200	925200	I don't know. It could be anything.
925200	926200	What do you mean?
926200	927200	What's the look?
927200	928200	You said that you see something.
928200	934200	I see like, I see like a little bit of like, like, like leg with like, like any kind of like nylon on it.
934200	936200	I'm not saying like, I see a outfit.
936200	938200	I'm saying like, the fetish is for.
938200	940200	It's simply legs and nylons.
940200	941200	Yeah.
942200	946200	I feel like we've been over it and I feel like we're not making it, you know, we're not making progress.
946200	947200	But I'm talking about this.
947200	948200	I feel like we're like a sideshow freak.
948200	949200	I feel like we're near it.
949200	950200	We're near a breakthrough right now.
950200	951200	No.
952200	953200	It's just a thing.
953200	955200	Everybody's got buttons, right?
955200	957200	You guys have buttons, little sexual buttons.
959200	960200	You know who I envy?
960200	966200	These people who get turned on by bare legs, high heels, big tits, and like a can of beer.
966200	969200	Like, because it's clearly their planet.
969200	978200	Like, like, like, you're like driving down the street and it's like, like, hey, Big Bang Theory's on five nights a week.
978200	982200	And it's like some ironic thing of like a woman going, oh, Big Bang Theory.
982200	984200	And there's a can of beer between her tits.
984200	987200	I don't know why I'm throwing Big Bang Theory under the bus.
987200	991200	I just mean like any product that would be like where the joke is that it's supposed to be sexual.
991200	993200	But like I look at it and I go, well, that's not sexual.
993200	995200	It's like a parody of sexuality.
995200	1000200	But there are some people in the world who are like, funny joke, plus I'm jerking off.
1003200	1008200	Because I also, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I am like, like I'm sure people, like I've said on the podcast,
1008200	1013200	like there's people would, if they were walking past it on the street, they'd be like, that's nothing.
1013200	1014200	That's a fire hydrant.
1014200	1016200	And I'd be like, that's my jam.
1018200	1021200	I was telling you backstage, I was at a party last night that was very pansexual.
1021200	1024200	It was kind of all over the shop and there was people that were trans.
1024200	1026200	And also like I don't know the words.
1026200	1027200	I will get them all wrong.
1027200	1031200	I don't know all the names for things that people are or don't want to be called or whatever.
1031200	1037200	But a friend of mine who is gay, but he is a man, but he is into other men.
1037200	1042200	But he wants, he likes to date straight men because he wants men.
1042200	1043200	Those are colored people.
1044200	1046200	You said you don't know the phrases.
1046200	1047200	That's colored people.
1047200	1048200	Colored people?
1051200	1052200	Did they change that?
1054200	1055200	Are you my grandma?
1056200	1057200	My grandma looked at the window.
1057200	1058200	She was the nicest lady in the world.
1058200	1059200	But she looked at the window.
1060200	1061200	Colored people.
1061200	1062200	My grandparents too.
1062200	1064200	But they were taught, that was their African-American.
1064200	1066200	And we've kind of, we, you know, we always do that.
1066200	1070200	Like we, in the 90s, like the African-American thing was trotted out.
1070200	1074200	It was never, it was never retracted, but like, I think there might be a, I don't even,
1074200	1077200	for all I know it's now, I haven't even checked in on this and how would you.
1077200	1083200	Remember when Kramer was apologizing for his little meltdown on Letterman and he called,
1083200	1085200	he called black people Afro-Americans?
1085200	1088200	Like, and it was like this really weird striking thing.
1088200	1091200	I mean, like what, well, colored people was introduced.
1091200	1096200	It was supposed to be like, you know, it was like a, it was, it was supposed to be a healthy thing.
1096200	1101200	The national association for whatever the blah, blah, blah, colored people has colored people right in their name.
1101200	1102200	Advancement, advancement.
1102200	1103200	I know what it is.
1106200	1108200	I mean, it's like, it was a fine thing.
1108200	1110200	And then we're like, oh, grandma.
1110200	1111200	But she's like saying it.
1111200	1113200	She's trying to do it right.
1113200	1114200	She's like, oh, there's a colored gentleman.
1114200	1117200	Like I, yeah, it's funny.
1117200	1118200	Our grandma's generation.
1118200	1124200	So my friend says, he goes like, I want men to treat me like a lady, but he's not a woman.
1124200	1125200	He's a guy.
1125200	1127200	But he wants, he likes straight men.
1127200	1128200	I'm like, wait, so what?
1128200	1130200	Your last boyfriend was a straight guy?
1130200	1131200	He goes, yeah.
1131200	1132200	He goes, my last boyfriend was straight.
1132200	1133200	And I go, did you guys fuck?
1133200	1134200	He goes, yeah, all the time.
1134200	1136200	And I was like, wait, wait, how does that work?
1136200	1139200	And he goes, he goes, ain't no fag going to fuck me like that.
1139200	1142200	I'm like, that's fucking fascinating.
1142200	1147200	And so he prefers straight dick to gay dick.
1147200	1151200	But it seems like it's pretty gay dick too.
1151200	1157200	A lot of us say, as with the, I think that's the Heisenberg principle.
1157200	1166200	If you can observe a straight dick in a gay butt or mouth, the moment you have observed
1166200	1171200	it as straight, it becomes gay.
1171200	1172200	But that's straight talk.
1172200	1176200	That's heteronormative psychology.
1176200	1177200	He should know better.
1177200	1180200	He's the expert when he's being fucked by a straight guy and when he's being fucked
1180200	1181200	by a gay guy.
1181200	1183200	The customer's always right, man.
1183200	1186200	It's up to him what he wants to call his customers, yeah.
1186200	1189200	But I mean, that's the thing.
1189200	1190200	What was I going to say?
1190200	1194200	Probably something inflammatory and dated and clumsy.
1194200	1195200	Were you still talking about colored people?
1195200	1198200	No, no, I wasn't going to talk about colored people.
1198200	1200200	Colored people, they're on their own.
1200200	1202200	The world's become too complicated.
1202200	1205200	Colored people, you're on your own.
1206200	1210200	What was it about sexuality, I'm trying to remember.
1210200	1212200	I was thinking of something while you were talking about that.
1212200	1216200	I just like the fact that, you know, as we grew up, I think we've talked about this a
1216200	1220200	bit, and of course, very poorly educated conversations about it.
1220200	1222200	When we grew up, it was this, that, or the other.
1222200	1225200	There was only kind of three or four Crayolas in that box.
1225200	1227200	Now there's a bunch, which is great.
1227200	1230200	But I just don't know, I don't really have the vocabulary for it.
1230200	1234200	Also, there was this switch, which I totally understand, but it was a definite switch
1234200	1239200	from our generation to this new generation, which is that now you're supposed to,
1239200	1247200	you're supposed to ask a little bit, which in our day, because there was only so
1247200	1250200	many things and being different just got you beat up.
1250200	1254200	And I kind of tried to broach this with, when Curtis was here, we were talking
1254200	1258200	about Revenge of the Nerds, which he totally said, you know, like you watch that
1258200	1261200	movie and it's like, yeah, politically correct lens.
1261200	1264200	That movie now commits more crimes than it ever solved.
1264200	1270200	But the interesting thing about when you watch that movie is that if you want to
1270200	1276200	understand the Gen X concept of political correctness and progress, all we ever
1276200	1283200	understood was going from bullying, going from bigotry to dropping that.
1283200	1288200	And so when you watch these 80s movies where underdogs are the new heroes, what
1288200	1293200	you're seeing is a lot of, for lack of a better word, ignorance, like ignoring
1293200	1294200	what makes people different.
1294200	1298200	So like you see like just unlikely families and one of them's gay and one of
1298200	1300200	them, but they don't make gay jokes.
1300200	1302200	They don't beat him up for being gay.
1302200	1303200	So he's one of the family.
1303200	1307200	And then this guy smokes pot and they don't, they smoke pot with him.
1307200	1310200	And it's just like, they're all put in this big pot.
1310200	1317200	And that's the Gen X version of progress is that we stop hurting each other.
1317200	1322200	And so if you, and that's when I ran into trouble, you know, recently or a couple
1322200	1327200	months ago, six months ago now, it was when our friend Jane was up, whose earth
1327200	1330200	shine you said you brought to that party and it was a big hit.
1330200	1331200	Jane should know that.
1331200	1333200	I have to, Jane's not here, I don't know, I imagine.
1333200	1336200	But I have to get, Jane, if you're listening, I have to get in touch with you
1336200	1340200	because I brought your absence to a party and it was everybody's favorite thing.
1340200	1343200	And I'm being tweeted about it a lot because everybody got stoned to the tits
1343200	1345200	on the fucking abs and it was very good.
1345200	1349200	I was drunk and I used the wrong pronoun a thousand times with her because
1349200	1354200	she was presenting very male and I was just drunk and whatever.
1354200	1358200	And then someone complained on Twitter and then I did not ingratiate myself
1358200	1364200	to the community with my response, which was like, if that's what you took away
1364200	1367200	from the podcast, you are too sensitive or whatever.
1367200	1374200	But the interesting takeaway that I took from all of that was like,
1374200	1378200	you know what, if you use that as a yardstick way out there,
1378200	1383200	this crazy new world, the word crazy offensive now,
1383200	1385200	in reference to some of the stuff.
1385200	1389200	But you're actually supposed to now explore and ask,
1389200	1395200	which was like, kind of like, goes back to like 60s and 70s kind of,
1395200	1399200	like when we were at a high of our Norman Lear kind of driven,
1399200	1403200	let's end racism, but then the 80s, 90s and things kind of ushered
1403200	1406200	in this world of like, you know what, put your hands in your pockets,
1406200	1409200	look at the ground and as long as you're not hurting anybody,
1409200	1412200	you're actually like for progress.
1412200	1416200	And it's like the way I put it was like when I was a kid on the playground,
1416200	1419200	anybody that like asked you if you're a boy or a girl
1419200	1423200	or what you preferred to be, that was called a bully.
1423200	1425200	I was asked that a lot.
1425200	1427200	I was asked if I was straight or gay.
1427200	1429200	I was asked if I was a boy or a girl.
1429200	1431200	I was asked why I don't shower.
1431200	1436200	I was asked all kinds of questions and they were not fun questions to be asked
1436200	1440200	and I was not happy to be asked them and the answers were not going to make
1440200	1443200	anyone happy and no one was seeking any actual answers.
1443200	1445200	There's a kind of a psychology there where you go,
1445200	1449200	I'm going to be a hip modern person when I grow up and I'm going to like,
1449200	1452200	I'm not going to, I'm going to go with the flow.
1452200	1455200	And then now we're entering this new world, we're going with the flow
1455200	1460200	all of a sudden now where we can end up being the tide of bigotry
1460200	1462200	by going with the flow.
1463200	1465200	Fart corner!
1469200	1474200	When you want the fart corner to start at the second bar.
1478200	1482200	What's his name? Richard Jenkins, who made that song?
1482200	1485200	Academy Award winner, Kevin MacLeod.
1485200	1488200	Kevin MacLeod, there can be only two.
1488200	1492200	Make another version of that song with like a little bar.
1492200	1494200	Give me a little ramp, Kevin.
1494200	1497200	And if your head comes away from your neck, it's over.
1497200	1499200	Where's the camera?
1499200	1501200	Where's the camera when that red light goes off
1501200	1503200	and then there's no red light anywhere?
1503200	1504200	It goes to another camera behind you.
1504200	1506200	Oh, there's a camera behind us.
1506200	1508200	If you're looking there, the red light will go on somewhere else.
1508200	1510200	See, now it's over there.
1511200	1512200	Now it's up there.
1513200	1514200	Now it's going to be over there.
1514200	1517200	Holy ground, Highlander!
1517200	1518200	All right.
1520200	1522200	Oh, MacLeod is Highlander's name.
1522200	1524200	Yeah, MacLeod is Highlander's name.
1525200	1527200	Thanks for backing me up, guys.
1528200	1531200	All right, so, yeah, Netflix seems popular.
1531200	1534200	That was my one thing I wrote on my notepad.
1534200	1535200	We sang some songs.
1535200	1539200	We talked about race and sexual preference again.
1539200	1545200	We finally solved it, I think.
1545200	1547200	I think we did.
1547200	1550200	It was International Women's Day today?
1550200	1551200	Was that today?
1551200	1552200	Yeah, and as someone wrote,
1552200	1555200	the only day in the year that has 23 hours in it.
1559200	1561200	Seems kind of fucked up.
1561200	1565200	I tweeted a bit like that that I thought deserved more response
1566200	1569200	because I combined it with that blackout day that just happened,
1569200	1571200	which I don't even know or understand,
1571200	1576200	but I also looked enough to see that me trying to understand it is not the point.
1578200	1581200	And so I tweeted this morning, Jeff, you'll like this.
1582200	1585200	International Women's Day, right after blackout day?
1585200	1587200	Wait, no.
1591200	1594200	I grant your blackout day on International Women's Day,
1594200	1598200	and I remind you that white men control the length of days.
1598200	1600200	I don't remember what I tweeted.
1600200	1601200	Wow.
1601200	1602200	Dan, can I go back a little bit?
1602200	1603200	Because I wrote a note, Dan,
1603200	1606200	while you were doing your earlier rap of the family song.
1606200	1607200	Uh-huh.
1607200	1608200	Did I hear you correctly?
1608200	1610200	Did you say spiders and sodomy?
1611200	1613200	No, but I wish I had.
1613200	1614200	What was it?
1614200	1617200	Spiders inside of me or spiders to the right of me?
1617200	1618200	Oh, spiders to the right of me, yeah.
1618200	1621200	Oh, I thought for sure you said spiders and sodomy.
1621200	1624200	Spiders to the left of me, the leprechauns to the right, I think,
1624200	1626200	or something like that, yeah.
1626200	1627200	Goddamn it.
1627200	1631200	I wish that song began in a way that let me really lean into it.
1631200	1633200	I think that you can really start,
1633200	1635200	you can declare the one for yourself wherever you like it.
1635200	1636200	It distracts me.
1636200	1639200	The song is like resolving things,
1639200	1642200	and then I'm on a different path.
1642200	1644200	Should we try a new song?
1647200	1649200	I don't think it was good, though.
1649200	1650200	What about the...
1656200	1659200	Yeah, so you don't seem very happy about that.
1660200	1662200	I'm gonna play a couple others just to remind you
1662200	1664200	how much you like the disco song.
1664200	1665200	Yeah, see anything?
1665200	1667200	Like it's like holding the...
1670200	1672200	It's like eating liver.
1679200	1680200	Yo.
1683200	1684200	Yo.
1684200	1685200	Yo.
1685200	1688200	Winter, summer, spring, fall.
1688200	1690200	Fucked your mama till she was three feet taller.
1690200	1692200	Banged her on the head with my dick,
1692200	1695200	like my dick was a hammer and she got sick.
1695200	1697200	Now she's in the bathroom and she's throwing up,
1697200	1701200	so I feel bad and I bought her a puppy.
1701200	1703200	Took it to the vet, they said,
1703200	1705200	you can't get it neutered yet.
1705200	1708200	You gotta take it home and put it in a crate
1708200	1710200	and let it outside when it pees.
1710200	1711200	That's great.
1711200	1713200	So it knows to pee outside.
1713200	1715200	I fucked your mama so hard, she's now three feet wide.
1715200	1718200	She's three feet tall, three feet wide.
1718200	1719200	Your mama's a spear.
1719200	1720200	I can't keep her inside.
1720200	1723200	I gotta put her on the lawn and play with her.
1724200	1725200	Your mama's Raymond Burr.
1725200	1728200	It's an actor from the 80s.
1729200	1732200	I fucked all the ladies, like 80s icons.
1732200	1736200	You will see a glass of my pee.
1737200	1741200	Well, oh wait, is that a new character, the lazy rapper?
1742200	1744200	Uh-oh, got a glass of my pee.
1744200	1746200	I don't know, put some pee in some poo
1746200	1749200	and fucked your mama like she was a shoe.
1749200	1751200	Snoop Dogg kind of phones it in,
1751200	1752200	so why don't I?
1752200	1756200	I fucked your mama in a bin, a mama bin.
1756200	1759200	I went to the store where they sell them in.
1759200	1761200	I bought two mama bins and took your mama home
1761200	1765200	and I fucked it with my friend and my cousin Jerome.
1765200	1767200	The same person.
1767200	1769200	I'm very close with my family.
1769200	1772200	I'm a lazy, lazy rapper.
1772200	1774200	I fucked your mama in the crapper.
1774200	1777200	I fucked your mama like my name was...
1782200	1785200	This is a lazy rapper.
1785200	1788200	Look how lazy this guy is.
1788200	1792200	He just ate up six measures.
1792200	1794200	I tried to think of...
1794200	1797200	so lazy.
1797200	1800200	This better pay off.
1800200	1802200	You can't rhyme crapper with crapper,
1802200	1805200	but where's that guy going?
1805200	1808200	I'm not working the crowd, I'm just fucking your mama
1808200	1811200	because the bitch is too loud.
1811200	1812200	That's my cure for snoring.
1812200	1814200	I fucked your mama so hot you can't be ignoring.
1814200	1818200	I'm a lazy rapper and I'm putting no effort in.
1818200	1820200	Fuck your mama in a bin.
1821200	1824200	He's a lazy, lazy rapper.
1827200	1829200	Thanks guys, thanks.
1829200	1831200	I feel like the only difference between lazy rapper
1831200	1834200	and your normal rapping is that it's just less loud.
1834200	1836200	Yeah, no, it's a style choice.
1836200	1838200	It's the same quality of rap.
1838200	1840200	They all have different styles.
1840200	1842200	Like Fitty said,
1842200	1845200	He raps like a this all the time.
1845200	1847200	I think I'm rapping all the time.
1849200	1850200	And then Snoop Dogg.
1850200	1852200	I need to hear you do some 50 Cent for him.
1856200	1858200	Well, it's got to be kind of a...
1858200	1860200	Okay, give me some Fitty.
1860200	1862200	Okay, I'll try, but...
1867200	1870200	I'm 50 Cent and I'm here to say
1870200	1873200	I cost 50 Cent all the year every day
1874200	1876200	But he's faster.
1876200	1878200	I mean, what am I doing?
1878200	1880200	But I'm just saying he has a cadence, he has a style.
1880200	1882200	And then Snoop Dogg's like,
1882200	1884200	Don't, don't, like I'm on, on, on.
1884200	1886200	And they honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, honk.
1886200	1888200	Yeah, okay, right.
1888200	1890200	Cause I'm a Snoop Dogg and I'm honk, honk, honk.
1890200	1893200	But that's true, and I put that mama too
1893200	1895200	And I honk, honk, honk, honk.
1895200	1897200	Yow, yow, baby, bow, baby doo
1897200	1900200	Gotta put your mama in a boot and a shoe
1900200	1902200	I'm a Snoop Dogg, a Snoop Dogg rapper.
1902200	1905200	50 Cent shoes, no rappers.
1905200	1908200	I'm a Snoop Dogg and I'm a Snoop Rob.
1908200	1910200	Ghostface killer! No, I'm kidding.
1910200	1912200	I don't know.
1912200	1914200	I don't know.
1914200	1916200	Dan, you have a gift.
1916200	1921200	I'm the rich little of 90s rappers.
1921200	1925200	But except for 50 Cent who'd probably shoot me for saying that.
1925200	1928200	What is it? His name is 50 Cent
1928200	1932200	because they pulled 50 Cent's worth of metal out of him
1932200	1934200	when he got shot. Was that the idea?
1934200	1936200	That's why he got the name 50 Cent.
1936200	1938200	Don't ask our crowd.
1938200	1940200	I thought that was it.
1940200	1942200	I remember looking that up.
1942200	1944200	He got shot and survived
1944200	1947200	and then they pulled enough metal out of him to make 50 Cent.
1947200	1949200	Something like that.
1949200	1952200	I don't think I'm getting it right, but it's close to that.
1952200	1956200	Black people don't have it easy.
1956200	1958200	Cops are bad.
1958200	1960200	Moving on.
1962200	1964200	But there are some cool cops.
1964200	1966200	We've already talked about that.
1966200	1968200	Obviously, there's some cool everything.
1968200	1970200	If all cops were evil, we would have figured it out by now.
1970200	1972200	For instance, if we all of a sudden had the internet,
1972200	1976200	all of a sudden you'd be seeing all these videos of them murdering people.
1976200	1980200	It would just start happening like that overnight.
1980200	1982200	It has.
1983200	1985200	I've met cool cops.
1985200	1989200	Have you ever met a cop and just hung out?
1989200	1992200	Like an off-duty cop?
1992200	1996200	When I was in college, I was a journalism student.
1996200	2000200	I did a piece where I interviewed a cop.
2000200	2004200	You had to write something about the police force.
2004200	2006200	I met a cop back in Whittier that I hated.
2006200	2008200	He was an asshole.
2008200	2010200	He was the chief of police back in Whittier.
2010200	2013200	They had this program of harassing the homeless people.
2013200	2015200	I sat him down.
2015200	2017200	We had lunch. I took him to a Mexican restaurant.
2017200	2019200	I'm 18 years old, 19 years old.
2019200	2021200	We sat down and had lunch.
2021200	2023200	He's like, look, I don't like you. You don't like me.
2023200	2027200	He gave me the kind of like, you can't handle the truth.
2027200	2029200	A few good men's speech.
2029200	2031200	You need people like me on that wall.
2031200	2034200	By the end of the lunch, I actually liked him.
2034200	2037200	He was a human being at the end of that lunch,
2037200	2039200	but I hate the way he operates.
2040200	2042200	He was a human being after it,
2042200	2046200	but I still think that he was teaching his younger officers
2046200	2050200	to come and treat homeless people automatically with disrespect
2050200	2053200	and automatically is less than human.
2053200	2056200	It's like there's two kinds of people in this world.
2056200	2059200	There's the kinds of people that think there's two kinds of people in this world,
2059200	2061200	and then there's the good people.
2061200	2068200	That's sort of what we call right-wing and left-wing in America.
2069200	2075200	There's this appealing thing about the idea that there's rules
2075200	2078200	and that there is no chaos and that there's never an exception
2078200	2081200	because that's how you do get shit done as you wake up in the morning
2081200	2083200	and decide that you deserve something
2083200	2085200	or that something needs to get done and all this stuff.
2085200	2091200	If you did plunge yourself exclusively into what we would call
2091200	2095200	the general left kind of psyche,
2095200	2098200	would you get shit done or would you...
2098200	2099200	I don't know.
2099200	2103200	Are those the competing parts of our species,
2103200	2105200	this idea that on one hand,
2105200	2109200	everything's crazy.
2109200	2112200	Wow, fuck, you never know anything.
2112200	2113200	I don't know.
2113200	2116200	It's like these brush-cut guys that we loathe
2116200	2118200	and that make us do these rituals
2118200	2120200	and they're constantly embarrassing themselves
2120200	2122200	and getting us all into trouble
2122200	2124200	and serving as an example to us.
2124200	2129200	It's a vicious cycle because I got pulled over
2129200	2131200	a couple weeks ago after I just landed at LAX,
2131200	2133200	was pulling out of this parking lot I always park at,
2133200	2134200	ran a stop sign.
2134200	2136200	He was right by the police station there.
2136200	2138200	I just kind of drifted through a stop sign and I got pulled over,
2138200	2141200	but the guy came to my window.
2141200	2143200	I could see him through my side view mirror.
2143200	2146200	He was a very young guy and I really feel like he was probably
2146200	2148200	a very new rookie.
2148200	2152200	He came at me like I had just robbed the president's bank
2152200	2155200	and kicked his mom in the wallet.
2155200	2158200	He was like handling his gun and freaking out,
2158200	2160200	and it freaked me out.
2160200	2162200	I think that's the wrong way to approach anybody.
2162200	2164200	Why does he keep running out of here?
2164200	2165200	Is he all right?
2165200	2166200	Is it the same guy?
2166200	2167200	Yeah, twice he's gone.
2167200	2168200	Well, we'll ask him when he gets back.
2168200	2170200	I'm sure he'll enjoy that.
2170200	2172200	Is he an old-timey reporter
2172200	2177200	that has to keep going to a phone booth outside?
2177200	2179200	Stop the presses!
2179200	2182200	Harmon calls Yahoo! Ridiculous!
2185200	2187200	I want to get home.
2187200	2188200	He's dropping his pen.
2188200	2189200	He's super nervous.
2189200	2190200	All right, what's going on?
2190200	2191200	What's your deal?
2191200	2193200	Sir, what's your name?
2193200	2194200	Nate.
2194200	2195200	Are you okay?
2195200	2196200	Is everything good?
2196200	2198200	Yeah, I'm just, I'm really thirsty.
2198200	2200200	Because you just returned with an A&W...
2200200	2202200	Jesus, sorry.
2202200	2204200	Everything's falling to shit.
2204200	2208200	You just returned with a giant two-liter bottle of water.
2208200	2210200	Did you go fill it up in the bathroom or what?
2210200	2213200	The water thing...
2213200	2214200	The sink.
2214200	2215200	The sink, yeah.
2215200	2217200	Can we talk to you for a second?
2217200	2218200	Can you just hold the mic?
2218200	2219200	Yeah, yeah.
2219200	2220200	Okay, I like your shirt.
2220200	2221200	Will you come and sit up here?
2221200	2222200	Can I sit up here?
2222200	2223200	Oh, okay.
2223200	2224200	Because the guy's got a shirt that says,
2224200	2225200	Cooking for Jesus.
2225200	2226200	All right.
2226200	2227200	Sit down here where you're like,
2227200	2228200	there you go.
2228200	2229200	Bring your giant water bottle up there, too,
2229200	2231200	because you're a very thirsty fellow.
2231200	2233200	Are you so into hydration that this is a thing,
2233200	2235200	or is this like a, like,
2235200	2237200	that's how much water you're going to drink
2237200	2238200	with our performance tonight?
2238200	2239200	Oh, no.
2239200	2240200	I just get nervous and stuff.
2240200	2241200	You get nervous.
2241200	2242200	Yeah.
2242200	2245200	And when you get nervous, you sprint off.
2245200	2247200	But you ran twice.
2247200	2249200	So what was the first time was to pee
2249200	2252200	and the second time was to fill up with more pre-pee?
2252200	2253200	Yeah.
2253200	2255200	Are you...
2255200	2257200	You don't feel attacked right now, right?
2257200	2258200	No, I'm good.
2258200	2259200	You feel safe?
2259200	2260200	Okay, good.
2260200	2262200	I'm not making a joke when I say that.
2262200	2265200	Like, you're not a freak.
2265200	2267200	Like, we just want to know what your...
2267200	2269200	You're a journey for us.
2269200	2272200	Now, this diet A&W root beer bottle,
2272200	2275200	have you drunk that root beer at some point today, too?
2275200	2277200	Or is this your water bottle?
2277200	2278200	No, it's just my water bottle.
2278200	2279200	That's what you carry around?
2279200	2280200	Yeah.
2280200	2281200	At all times?
2281200	2283200	Well, I mean, I get a different one sometimes.
2283200	2284200	Are you on a...
2284200	2286200	Is it a kick that you're on right now,
2286200	2289200	like a diet where you have to drink a lot of water?
2289200	2290200	No, I don't know.
2290200	2292200	Is this something you've always done?
2292200	2294200	No, I...
2295200	2297200	It's 80% of the Earth.
2297200	2298200	You're the good guy.
2298200	2301200	Like, we should all drink more water.
2301200	2303200	I got sick.
2303200	2305200	And I got really paranoid that if I didn't drink water,
2305200	2307200	I'd get a sore throat.
2307200	2308200	So I was like...
2308200	2310200	How much water do you think you drink a day?
2310200	2313200	What is it, like 80 to 100 liters a day?
2313200	2316200	Not 100 liters.
2316200	2321200	80 to 100 liters of water a day.
2321200	2322200	What's your name?
2322200	2323200	Nate.
2323200	2324200	Nate.
2324200	2326200	How much water are you getting through a day, do you think?
2326200	2327200	Maybe like four of you.
2327200	2328200	Four of you?
2328200	2331200	I feel like you're asking the wrong questions.
2331200	2333200	Is it because he's not...
2333200	2335200	You're being evasive, aren't you?
2335200	2337200	You know that it's weird to drink this much water
2337200	2339200	with this much urgency,
2339200	2342200	and you're not just telling us what we need to know.
2342200	2343200	Are you diabetic?
2343200	2344200	No, no.
2344200	2346200	You got a cold, and now you have a little...
2346200	2348200	So that's it, just to stave off a feeling
2348200	2349200	that you're going to get sick?
2349200	2351200	Yeah, it's like a...
2351200	2352200	Yeah, I don't know.
2353200	2354200	Placebo!
2355200	2357200	Someone just sung placebo.
2358200	2361200	No, I mean, that's the greatest addiction to have,
2361200	2362200	is to run off and drink water.
2362200	2363200	God, I wish.
2364200	2366200	There's a sink here that you're just filling up,
2366200	2368200	and I wouldn't drink out of the L.A. tap water in a...
2368200	2370200	Oh, yeah, I mean...
2372200	2374200	Oh...
2374200	2376200	Someone said that's how you got your...
2376200	2378200	I always wonder about that, too.
2378200	2380200	Well, so, Nate, any advice out there
2381200	2383200	for people out there that want to drink more water?
2383200	2384200	I...
2386200	2388200	I'm a bad interviewer.
2389200	2392200	You make Arsenio Hall look like Mike Wallace.
2395200	2398200	Well, I guess, thank you for bravely coming up
2398200	2400200	and giving us more answers.
2400200	2402200	Nate, if at any moment, Nate,
2402200	2404200	you have to get up and run out and go pee,
2404200	2406200	we're not going to make a deal out of it.
2406200	2407200	Wait, what did you just say, Nate?
2407200	2408200	Did you ask a question?
2408200	2410200	Oh, can we just talk about, like, some other than water?
2410200	2411200	Oh, some other than water.
2411200	2414200	Well, we have another guest here to do that.
2414200	2416200	And so far, all you are is...
2416200	2417200	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2417200	2419200	So far, all you are is the water guy.
2419200	2420200	I mean, you can't just...
2420200	2421200	What's on your mind, Nate?
2421200	2422200	Have you got some pressing issues?
2422200	2423200	You can't just drink so much water
2423200	2425200	that we get your opinions about Obama.
2427200	2428200	That's not fair.
2428200	2430200	That's what Donald Trump tries to do.
2430200	2431200	I'll build a bunch of buildings,
2431200	2433200	and then I'll have opinions.
2433200	2434200	You can't...
2434200	2435200	Wait, that was 50 cent.
2439200	2441200	The emperor has no clothes.
2443200	2444200	He's so thirsty.
2444200	2446200	God, I really think...
2446200	2448200	You go to the doctor and just say,
2448200	2451200	Dan Harmon said to ask, am I diabetic?
2452200	2453200	Just in case.
2453200	2454200	Are you diagnosing him as diabetic?
2454200	2456200	No, I'm telling his doctor to.
2458200	2460200	Are diabetics notoriously thirsty?
2460200	2461200	Yes, that's one of the big symptoms
2461200	2463200	when you're not diagnosed yet.
2463200	2464200	That's the first thing that happens.
2464200	2465200	It's like, you're...
2465200	2466200	Fuck, I'm so thirsty.
2466200	2467200	And then you go in, and they're like,
2467200	2468200	yeah, motherfucker.
2468200	2469200	Goodbye, ice cream.
2469200	2471200	Welcome to...
2471200	2473200	Who else, besides me right now,
2473200	2475200	is getting thirsty just having this conversation?
2475200	2477200	Everybody wants a drink.
2477200	2479200	Pass your bottle around.
2481200	2482200	Nate, what's on your mind real quick?
2482200	2483200	Is there anything pressing on your mind?
2483200	2486200	What would you talk to us about if you...
2486200	2487200	If you got the conch for a while,
2487200	2489200	what would you lay down on us?
2491200	2492200	Okay, I don't know.
2492200	2495200	This is kind of like a question my friend had.
2496200	2497200	Like...
2497200	2499200	So he said, like...
2499200	2500200	This is a good start.
2502200	2503200	It's a good start.
2503200	2505200	Your friend said...
2505200	2506200	Okay, he said, like,
2506200	2508200	he was reading, um,
2508200	2511200	the mythology guy, the...
2511200	2512200	Joseph Campbell.
2512200	2513200	Yes, yes.
2513200	2515200	And he said, like,
2515200	2516200	if you...
2516200	2518200	Like, a lot of religions say that you're guilty, right?
2518200	2521200	But that feels better than a feeling of, like,
2522200	2525200	you have no say in what happens in the universe.
2526200	2529200	So, like, what do you think's tougher as a feeling?
2530200	2532200	Well, I mean, I think that...
2534200	2536200	I think that what you named it already,
2536200	2539200	what's tougher is the idea that you don't have a choice in anything.
2539200	2540200	I mean, we can't handle that.
2540200	2542200	We don't perceive the world that way.
2542200	2544200	We make choices in real time.
2544200	2546200	We think of them as choices.
2546200	2550200	It's only the introduction of philosophy that suggests the idea,
2550200	2555200	the technical concept that we technically don't choose anything.
2555200	2559200	And the irony is that probably that's true.
2559200	2561200	I mean, it almost obviously is,
2561200	2562200	because there's...
2562200	2563200	What the hell is choice?
2563200	2566200	I mean, that debate will drive you crazy,
2566200	2570200	because if all of the circumstances are the same,
2570200	2574200	then that would be like saying that I flip a coin somewhere in my brain,
2574200	2576200	like, on some primal level,
2576200	2578200	and that would be something that we didn't want,
2578200	2582200	we want to think of ourselves as being creatures of some substance
2582200	2584200	and not just a bunch of dice.
2584200	2586200	So, we believe in choice.
2586200	2588200	We experience life as choice.
2588200	2590200	I think choice is something we made up.
2590200	2597200	We also made up the idea of any kind of organization to everything,
2597200	2598200	because what is it?
2598200	2602200	We're living in a very, very slowed down giant explosion.
2602200	2605200	Nathan's had three sips of water during that.
2605200	2607200	I'm making him very nervous.
2608200	2609200	Is it a nervous response?
2609200	2612200	It's got to be something that has to be related to a nervous response there.
2612200	2614200	You're not that thirsty. Is it possible?
2614200	2616200	I'm really not that thirsty.
2616200	2618200	Is that like Lanish's blanket for you?
2618200	2620200	Yeah, it's like a tick almost.
2620200	2622200	Oh yeah, I got that.
2622200	2624200	We all have our own ticks.
2624200	2626200	That's a very healthy one to have, by the way.
2626200	2627200	Yeah.
2627200	2629200	Mine is PCP.
2631200	2633200	I strangle the prostitute.
2634200	2636200	I have to touch the light switch three times
2636200	2638200	before I leave the house, and then I'm like,
2639200	2640200	you're just like the others.
2640200	2642200	Okay, now I can edit.
2642200	2644200	Nate, everybody, thank you, Nate.
2646200	2647200	Thank you, Nate.
2647200	2648200	Always a...
2648200	2651200	Carment Town's thirstiest fan.
2652200	2654200	I always appreciate it when people come up here,
2654200	2657200	and they subject themselves to the scrutiny of the spotlight.
2657200	2660200	We would just worry, because you darted out here like something...
2661200	2663200	Oh, I was trying to make it like not awkward, you know.
2664200	2667200	Well, mission unaccomplished.
2669200	2672200	From now on, Nate, just walk at any page you like.
2672200	2674200	You can sprint out, you can jog out, you can walk out,
2674200	2675200	you can crawl out.
2675200	2677200	We're not going to make a deal out of it.
2677200	2679200	I mean, look at Anatoly next to you.
2679200	2681200	This fucking guy, don't move.
2681200	2683200	I'm taking a picture of this.
2683200	2686200	This is like the height of balls.
2686200	2688200	Is that Garcia Lorca on your shirt?
2688200	2689200	In your shirt, who is that?
2689200	2690200	It's Anton Chekov.
2691200	2692200	Anton Chekov.
2692200	2693200	All right.
2693200	2695200	He had the greatest death of all time.
2696200	2697200	How did he die?
2697200	2698200	As far as I know.
2698200	2700200	Do you know the circumstances of his death, Anatoly?
2700200	2701200	No.
2701200	2703200	As far as I read that he was quite an old man.
2703200	2705200	I think he was in his 80 or so,
2705200	2708200	and he was on his plantation or whatever, his estate.
2708200	2711200	And he and his old wife, he'd been with forever.
2711200	2714200	They had a family over, and he would walk out in the garden,
2714200	2717200	and he would just improvise stories for his grandchildren.
2717200	2720200	And they would go, like, grandpa, the light, the lamp post.
2720200	2723200	And he would just improvise the story for them.
2723200	2724200	So all the family goes away.
2724200	2725200	He comes back in.
2725200	2727200	The family goes home.
2727200	2728200	It's just he and his old wife.
2728200	2731200	And she says, let's have champagne and some strawberries
2731200	2732200	or something.
2732200	2734200	And he goes, I haven't had champagne in a very long time.
2734200	2735200	I think I'll rest.
2735200	2737200	And so she goes off to get the champagne.
2737200	2739200	When she comes back, he's laying on the couch dead
2739200	2740200	with a smile on his face.
2740200	2743200	And she sits down next to him and drinks the champagne
2743200	2744200	and has the strawberries.
2744200	2746200	And she's like, fuck it.
2746200	2747200	That's a great death.
2747200	2750200	And then at his funeral, I guess all these Russians turned out
2750200	2751200	to go to his funeral.
2751200	2752200	And I might have this wrong.
2752200	2754200	Somebody please fact check this.
2754200	2758200	I think it's Chekhov's death, where they all go.
2758200	2759200	A coffin's on a train car.
2759200	2762200	And they all march behind the train car in the cold rain
2762200	2763200	or whatever.
2763200	2765200	And it's a bunch of fancy-pants society people
2765200	2767200	that all want to go more in Chekhov's death.
2767200	2769200	They realize that also it smells like crap
2769200	2771200	because they're following the wrong train,
2771200	2772200	and it's got oysters on it.
2772200	2774200	And it says it's rotting fish.
2774200	2776200	And they had followed, for miles, the wrong train.
2776200	2778200	And they had to go all the way back in the other direction
2778200	2780200	to follow the right train back.
2780200	2783200	And his friends of Chekhov said it's like he wrote his own funeral
2783200	2785200	because that's exactly what he would have written.
2785200	2788200	But falling asleep while your wife is off to get champagne
2788200	2790200	and her coming back, and you have a smile on your face,
2790200	2792200	and she finishes the champagne, is groovy.
2792200	2793200	I like that.
2793200	2795200	You know, you hold your breath out because you go like,
2795200	2796200	well, OK.
2796200	2799200	So I would come back, and I would be like, ah, no!
2799200	2802200	No!
2803200	2805200	And then in between shaking the corpse, I'd be like,
2805200	2809200	why couldn't you have done it after calling me a cunt?
2809200	2810200	Why is that better?
2810200	2811200	Because what the fuck?
2811200	2813200	I was looking forward to having champagne.
2813200	2815200	Like, the one afternoon, it was going to be nice.
2815200	2816200	They were into the 80s.
2816200	2817200	They're old people. It's going to happen.
2817200	2818200	I know.
2818200	2819200	Like, ostensibly, they've done it before.
2819200	2820200	No, I know.
2820200	2821200	I'm the bad guy.
2821200	2823200	But I'm saying, like, that's why I'm afraid.
2823200	2826200	That's fear of death is the thing that makes you go, no!
2826200	2828200	Like, I want the good things.
2828200	2831200	If you were an 80, let's say your 90 and Aaron would be what?
2831200	2832200	80?
2832200	2833200	How much time would she be?
2833200	2834200	She'd be like 23.
2834200	2835200	She's 23.
2835200	2836200	All right.
2836200	2837200	I forgot.
2837200	2838200	She's a fetus right now.
2838200	2842200	And you're in your old people, and if you peacefully passed away
2842200	2845200	at 90 years old and she came in with a bottle of Kettle One
2845200	2849200	and sat down next to you, and you had a smile on your face,
2849200	2850200	it's a pleasant way to go.
2850200	2852200	I'm going to cry thinking about that.
2852200	2853200	That's so fucked up.
2853200	2854200	You're 90 years old in this story?
2854200	2858200	But it's just, I would have, that would have been the first afternoon
2858200	2859200	that I stopped working.
2859200	2862200	And I would be like, oh, let's have some Kettle One.
2862200	2867200	Like, maybe once it gets boring, like, a good death would be like,
2867200	2870200	okay, let's go to Costco.
2870200	2873200	And she's like, I'll go get the card.
2873200	2875200	And then she comes back and I'm dead.
2875200	2880200	And she'd be like, she'd look at my corpse and look at the card
2880200	2886200	and be like, I can go to Albertson's because no bulk.
2886200	2892200	And it's like, oh, he nailed his death.
2892200	2894200	We don't have to go to Costco.
2894200	2897200	There was a big fear when they found out that Jimi Hendrix had lied
2897200	2900200	about being gay to get out of the Vietnam War, and Greg said,
2900200	2904200	I lied about being gay last Wednesday to get out of going to Home Depot.
2904200	2905200	All right.
2905200	2910200	He graciously, like, I told him to come because there's never been
2910200	2914200	a more overwhelming demand for somebody to come back,
2914200	2917200	specifically for his performance in Shadowrun.
2917200	2918200	Curtis Armstrong came back.
2918200	2919200	Oh, shit!
2919200	2927200	How special.
2927200	2933200	Thank you.
2933200	2935200	Thank you.
2935200	2937200	Thank you.
2937200	2940200	Hi!
2940200	2942200	Thank you.
2942200	2943200	Oh, gosh.
2943200	2946200	I've never been asked back anywhere.
2946200	2949200	Usually they're so relieved.
2949200	2952200	After the show last time, we were like, you had split
2952200	2954200	and we were back in the green room and Dan's like,
2954200	2955200	I really want him to come back.
2955200	2956200	I'm like, ask him.
2956200	2957200	He's like, I don't know.
2957200	2958200	That seems like forward.
2958200	2960200	I'm like, it's better to ask and him say no.
2960200	2961200	Like, let's just ask.
2961200	2962200	Well, like I'm going to say no.
2962200	2966200	But you said last week, you said, you know, you have to come back.
2966200	2968200	Everybody always says you have to come back,
2968200	2969200	and then you never hear from them again.
2969200	2971200	Oh, is that what's going on on the other side of this conversation?
2971200	2973200	You have to come back and then they go, yeah.
2973200	2974200	No, no, no.
2974200	2976200	What was happening in this case was you said to me,
2976200	2977200	we have to have you back.
2977200	2978200	And I said, great.
2978200	2979200	That would be great.
2979200	2981200	And then I walked out thinking, well, he'll never go.
2981200	2982200	Oh, this is great.
2982200	2983200	Wow.
2983200	2984200	What a great new family member.
2984200	2986200	I actually get asked back.
2986200	2989200	No one ever does that.
2989200	2993200	Now you have to come back every week for sure.
2993200	2999200	That's great.
2999200	3002200	Which you'll do until this season of King of the Nerds.
3002200	3003200	Gets picked up.
3003200	3004200	And then I don't have to.
3004200	3005200	Yeah.
3005200	3007200	And then you'll be like, fuck you nerds.
3007200	3009200	Fly away in your biplane.
3009200	3011200	That's how I picture rich people.
3011200	3012200	Yeah.
3012200	3013200	Just flying in a biplane.
3013200	3014200	Yeah.
3014200	3015200	Not seeing that.
3015200	3019200	We should, let's also just, let's bring out a tidal wave of friends.
3019200	3021200	Let's bring out Spencer.
3021200	3023200	Spencer.
3023200	3026200	Spencer Crittenden.
3026200	3028200	Spencer, get your cheeks out here.
3029200	3031200	He may have, okay.
3031200	3033200	Spencer's getting high in the back or something.
3033200	3034200	He was back there somewhere.
3034200	3036200	Well, he probably, when we brought you up, he's probably like,
3036200	3041200	I probably have about 10 minutes to do what needs to be done.
3041200	3044200	And he grabbed his rubber hose and his needle.
3044200	3045200	What time is it?
3045200	3046200	903.
3046200	3049200	If I know Spencer, he's given cut rate hand jobs out in the parking lot.
3049200	3053200	I do it because I like to do it.
3053200	3055200	That's the thing.
3055200	3057200	That's the thing about hand jobs.
3057200	3061200	I like giving them.
3061200	3064200	But you never, you never, no one ever tells you.
3064200	3065200	Yeah.
3065200	3067200	Well, you should, you should give, you should just give them.
3067200	3070200	Spencer impression like ran on some rocks.
3070200	3071200	Wow.
3071200	3073200	You're really a bad impressionist.
3073200	3074200	Yeah.
3074200	3075200	I don't know.
3075200	3077200	I mean, it's just learning new things about, about your, your coworkers.
3077200	3078200	Do you have, do you have any impression?
3078200	3081200	I will not make you do them, but do you, do you, are you a person that has
3081200	3082200	impressions in you or do you not?
3082200	3083200	Oh, no, no, no.
3083200	3085200	I don't really, I don't really have impressions.
3085200	3086200	I as a child.
3086200	3087200	You're a dancer.
3087200	3095200	Hey, here he is.
3095200	3102200	Well, out in the parking lot, he's given HJs.
3102200	3105200	Looks like you're bringing those to flaunt.
3105200	3107200	You've got water in every pocket.
3107200	3111200	Oh, yeah.
3111200	3115200	You know, there's more than one guy that drinks in a normal amount of water, Dan.
3115200	3117200	No, I just, I'm sorry.
3117200	3118200	I came on and I cut you off.
3118200	3119200	That was the root of me.
3119200	3120200	It's all right.
3120200	3121200	It's all right.
3121200	3124200	I actually had started a water backstage, but I left it there because I was
3124200	3125200	self-conscious after.
3125200	3126200	Jesus.
3126200	3129200	I don't want to be the anti-water guy.
3129200	3133200	I figured I, you know, you'd, you'd, you know, start in on me.
3133200	3135200	I still, I still think.
3135200	3136200	Curtis.
3136200	3137200	Curtis.
3137200	3138200	I still think that guy is being dodgy.
3138200	3139200	I'm cool, man.
3139200	3140200	I'm cool.
3140200	3141200	He, he got up twice.
3141200	3143200	This is what I don't understand.
3143200	3144200	How thirsty can you be?
3144200	3147200	Within 45 seconds of my memory, it was very close together.
3147200	3151200	So one time it was to pee and one time it was to get water, but he's, water is
3151200	3153200	part of his life.
3153200	3154200	I don't know.
3154200	3158200	I think the guy is like shady and dishonest and a terrible person.
3158200	3160200	I don't think so.
3160200	3163200	He's cooking for Jesus.
3163200	3166200	Obviously, I'm kidding.
3166200	3171200	I just, you know, we're concerned about our fans when they go running like that.
3171200	3172200	So, so, all right.
3172200	3180200	So where did we leave off moonlighting?
3180200	3182200	My wife is not coming this week.
3182200	3183200	She's not coming this week.
3183200	3187200	She's she doesn't get to ask me those really awkward questions that I had to
3187200	3190200	follow up each time because I wasn't sure what she meant.
3190200	3192200	Yeah.
3192200	3195200	She, she is sick.
3195200	3198200	I don't know how much more I'm supposed to say.
3198200	3199200	She's pooping a lot.
3199200	3200200	She's puking.
3200200	3202200	Sounds like, sounds like diabetes.
3202200	3205200	She, she thought it was food poisoning.
3205200	3209200	By the way, my lovely wife, I just listened to their first episode of their,
3209200	3213200	their new podcast that she's doing with Wayne Fetterman called human conversation.
3213200	3216200	It's a, it's 55 minutes of your life.
3216200	3218200	It's not that big a deal.
3218200	3221200	Give it a listen.
3221200	3222200	It's like a rage.
3222200	3224200	Dan Harmon from the Chicago Tribune.
3224200	3226200	It's a, it's a pleasant chat.
3226200	3228200	I mean, I honestly, I've only listened to one episode.
3228200	3230200	There's something kind of addictive about it.
3230200	3233200	It's like, it sort of hearkens back to a kind of like, I don't know,
3233200	3236200	morning or afternoon, like kind of, it's just a man and a woman.
3236200	3239200	They're just chatting and it's kind of, it's, it's, it's funny to me.
3239200	3242200	I listened to it, but then again, I'm a big fan of my wife.
3242200	3243200	I don't know.
3243200	3246200	But this Wayne Fetterman fellow seems very, very funny too.
3246200	3249200	He's kind of, he's kind of like, he's coaching her basketball team.
3249200	3250200	I'm not mistaken.
3250200	3251200	Yeah.
3251200	3255200	And he sort of, he sort of has a kind of like old man sensibility that kind of
3255200	3260200	like, uh, I don't know, like liberates you to look at the world, uh, uh,
3260200	3263200	randomly or a fresh, like he doesn't use profanity.
3263200	3265200	He, I don't know.
3265200	3270200	It's funny when I think about how he must see me like, why is he so,
3270200	3271200	why does he have to be angry?
3271200	3273200	Um, anyways, Curtis.
3273200	3278200	Uh, I know where do you start?
3278200	3279200	Right.
3279200	3282200	I mean, I feel like, you know, you were sort of on a roll and then I came out.
3282200	3283200	No, no, no.
3283200	3284200	Curtis Curtis.
3284200	3287200	You're sitting only three feet away from one of the greatest, most gifted
3287200	3288200	interviewers of all time.
3288200	3289200	I know.
3289200	3290200	Oh yeah.
3290200	3291200	I know.
3291200	3292200	I've been here before.
3292200	3295200	Be prepared to answer some very trenchant, very salient questions.
3295200	3296200	Okay.
3296200	3298200	Fire away, man.
3298200	3302200	When did you lose your virginity?
3302200	3303200	I know.
3303200	3308200	And how and why?
3308200	3310200	In any order.
3310200	3311200	Okay.
3311200	3324200	I lost my virginity at the age of 21 or two.
3324200	3325200	Jill?
3325200	3329200	She's here?
3329200	3333200	Unbelievable.
3333200	3334200	Was it Jill?
3334200	3335200	It's Jill.
3335200	3337200	She's here.
3338200	3343200	I lost my virginity at the age of 21 or 22 in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
3343200	3344200	Whoa.
3344200	3345200	Sounds like you're making that up.
3345200	3346200	I'm not.
3346200	3349200	So you had a gal in Kalamazoo?
3349200	3352200	Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo.
3352200	3356200	And she took pity on me where none had before.
3356200	3363200	And, um, and she, she deprived me of my virginity.
3363200	3365200	But only once.
3365200	3370200	Is this still the same Curtis that was playing a tableau violin?
3370200	3374200	No, this is a slightly later Curtis just by a couple of years.
3374200	3377200	What was your bag at age 21, 22?
3377200	3384200	Um, I did English accents because I thought it might make me more attractive.
3384200	3387200	So I would learn to do English accents.
3387200	3394200	And in fact, I remember Jill telling me that the reason she actually slept with me was because of my English accent.
3395200	3397200	So it worked.
3397200	3400200	How did, how did you, how did she encounter it?
3400200	3402200	Well, because I would do it.
3402200	3408200	But, but I mean, like, well, so you were working the Friday window and you're like, would you like all fries with that?
3408200	3412200	No, no, no, it was a more, it wasn't like a governor one.
3412200	3417200	It was more of a, could you, could you do it by region that you say accents that could you do regionally?
3417200	3418200	Yeah, I would do.
3418200	3423200	Well, I mean, I would do my idea of regions, but it would, it would really would be, would be like a bad call.
3424200	3427200	And then there would be, it would be Nigel Bruce.
3427200	3432200	It would be a Cockney or, you know, extraordinary homes, that sort of thing.
3433200	3435200	That's a very good Nigel Bruce, by the way.
3435200	3436200	You can do impressions.
3436200	3437200	That's very good.
3437200	3438200	Well, that was, that was one.
3438200	3439200	Yeah, I did do that one.
3439200	3441200	I used to do them when I was a child.
3441200	3446200	I think Nigel Bruce is too blustery as, as, uh, I agree with you as Watson.
3446200	3448200	Yes, he's too blustery, but I loved him.
3448200	3449200	Yeah, he's great.
3449200	3451200	He's not Watson, but I loved him.
3451200	3452200	Yeah, he's not.
3452200	3454200	And I, and I found I could do him.
3454200	3457200	Now, doing Nigel Bruce doesn't get you laid.
3457200	3458200	You would have to do it.
3458200	3460200	Unless you're, unless you're doing Nigel Bruce.
3464200	3466200	Who only has sex with straight men?
3467200	3468200	It's a callback.
3475200	3480200	My favorite part of that, of that fan of a joke was watching the lights in the camera try to find where the comedy was.
3481200	3489200	The director's like, something has to be, something funny has to be going on right now.
3490200	3491200	Hold it.
3492200	3496200	Did I take this young lady and you were part of the same theatrical community?
3496200	3499200	Yes, we were in, in school, you know, in college.
3499200	3508200	And I had done, I had done a part in a play that somebody had written and I did it with an English accent, not because it was required.
3509200	3515200	Because, because I thought it would be a good chance to show off my English accent and it worked.
3515200	3522200	All right. Well, we're getting to know you and I'm trying to play it cool, but it's 9-11 and we were trying to establish a tradition here at 9-11.
3522200	3523200	Oh my God.
3523200	3525200	What do we do? We make a, we never get this right.
3525200	3528200	Oh, it was the 9-11 thing from last week.
3528200	3529200	Did we just sing the 9-11 song?
3529200	3530200	Hit it.
3533200	3534200	No, that's probably gonna be offensive.
3534200	3535200	Okay.
3536200	3538200	That's gonna end up offensive.
3538200	3540200	Oh, not if it's sultry though.
3544200	3545200	Yeah.
3548200	3553200	Why'd you have to bring those towers down?
3554200	3560200	Why'd you have to bring my country a frown?
3561200	3564200	We're just trying to be free.
3564200	3567200	Why you gotta attack me?
3567200	3572200	Lay your terrorist body down to the brink of dawn.
3572200	3575200	Yo, Al-Qaeda, why you gotta be like that?
3575200	3576200	Ain't no fighting.
3576200	3578200	Ain't it gotta be a spat?
3578200	3584200	Yo, Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan ain't, ain't trying to do it in Iraq and Iran.
3584200	3587200	You gotta, I'm just trying to be cool in New York.
3587200	3592200	I gotta look up to the sky and see it falling pork.
3592200	3597200	What I thought, but I found out it was, it's fucked up.
3597200	3599200	I'm gonna cry.
3599200	3600200	I'm traumatized.
3600200	3604200	I saw a guy who told me it was P to the T-S-D.
3604200	3607200	I thought, shouldn't get that in the city, you see.
3607200	3610200	I'm just a deli worker and a rapper on the side,
3610200	3613200	trying to lay it low and open up wide.
3613200	3617200	I'm gonna live my life and pay my revenues.
3617200	3620200	Fuck you, Al-Qaeda.
3620200	3623200	Why you choose to attack us?
3623200	3627200	Cause you're gonna pay no freedom.
3627200	3629200	Why you hate a way of life?
3629200	3631200	You go all the way down.
3631200	3634200	Two towers and two states of mind.
3634200	3639200	When you look beyond it, you'll find that everybody just wants to get down.
3639200	3643200	Got a tower on the left and now it's down.
3643200	3644200	Fuck.
3644200	3645200	Why the fuck you do that?
3645200	3649200	Now everybody's changed and language is changing like a, oh shit,
3649200	3651200	I can't rap anymore.
3651200	3655200	I'm all broken up cause of 9-11.
3655200	3656200	All right.
3656200	3657200	Okay.
3661200	3662200	Jesus.
3666200	3667200	Wow.
3668200	3671200	The final casualty of 9-11 is your ability to rap.
3673200	3676200	I blamed it on 9-11, you know.
3676200	3677200	Do you want a drink, Curtis?
3677200	3679200	I might have one in a minute.
3679200	3680200	I'm okay right now, thank you.
3680200	3683200	When you do, then take a cup, otherwise I'm digging in your ice.
3683200	3684200	That's all right.
3684200	3687200	It'll be a reminder that I've been digging the ice all night.
3687200	3688200	Okay.
3688200	3691200	So Jill, where did it all go?
3691200	3692200	Jill?
3692200	3694200	Where did it go down with Jill?
3694200	3695200	Where did it go down with Jill?
3695200	3696200	Where did it happen?
3696200	3699200	In my room at the college.
3699200	3700200	You have an apartment, a dorm or what?
3700200	3701200	A dorm, yeah.
3701200	3702200	A dorm, yeah.
3702200	3703200	Yeah.
3703200	3704200	And you know, it was just once.
3704200	3705200	Yeah.
3705200	3706200	Never again, one timer?
3706200	3707200	No, that was it.
3707200	3709200	I mean, since then, yes.
3709200	3717200	But with Jill, it was just the one time.
3717200	3718200	Enjoyable?
3718200	3719200	Was it a good time?
3719200	3720200	It was very quick.
3722200	3723200	It was very quick, but yeah.
3723200	3726200	I mean, she only needed the one.
3726200	3728200	Yes, it went perfectly.
3728200	3729200	Yeah.
3729200	3731200	Once it's done and it's done and you move on with your life.
3731200	3732200	Yeah.
3732200	3734200	And she did.
3734200	3740200	And I never found anyone who was as attracted to the English accent after that.
3740200	3742200	That was like a one time thing that worked.
3742200	3744200	Did you try the English accent?
3744200	3746200	Yeah, I still do.
3746200	3747200	Really?
3747200	3748200	Yeah.
3748200	3752200	One time I was at a bar, I had a roommate who was Irish, and we were at a bar pretending
3752200	3755200	to do Scottish accents, and there was nobody at this bar.
3755200	3758200	He was Irish, but he was pretending to do Scottish accents?
3758200	3761200	He was from Dublin, and we were hanging out at the three of clubs, and there was nobody
3761200	3764200	in the bar but us and the bartenders, and they were far down the other side of the
3764200	3765200	room.
3765200	3768200	And so for some reason, he was talking about a friend of his, and he was doing a
3768200	3770200	Scottish accent to tell this story.
3770200	3772200	And so I started doing it, too.
3772200	3774200	And then these girls came up next to us in order to drink.
3774200	3776200	And they're like, oh, where are you guys from?
3776200	3778200	And he's like, oh, it's from Aberdeen.
3778200	3781200	And he could really do it, and I could kind of do it.
3781200	3782200	And so he was nailing it.
3782200	3784200	And they're like, oh, my God, this accent is so great.
3784200	3787200	And then all their friends showed up, and there were more girls.
3787200	3792200	Now, the bartenders had known they knew me, and they knew that we weren't Scottish
3792200	3795200	earlier in that evening.
3795200	3797200	Now we're doing it because now we just don't want it.
3797200	3799200	Like, now it's just embarrassing to stop doing it.
3799200	3800200	Of course.
3800200	3803200	At any moment, these girls will get their drinks, go leave, sit down somewhere, and
3803200	3804200	leave with something like that will be that.
3804200	3810200	And they just, more people came around, and it's like, I've been to Aberdeen, and he,
3810200	3812200	oh, OK, now you're in trouble.
3812200	3814200	But she's like, how far is Aberdeen from Leith?
3814200	3816200	I said, oh, it's about 45 minutes to go up there.
3816200	3818200	And he knew all the fucking shit.
3818200	3819200	And so there was one girl there.
3819200	3821200	Her name was Mouse.
3821200	3823200	And I had never met this girl in my life.
3823200	3826200	Was she a DJ?
3826200	3827200	She actually was a DJ.
3827200	3831200	All right.
3831200	3833200	Well spotted.
3833200	3835200	But I had not met this girl in my life.
3835200	3838200	It was either that or her parents raised her in a basement.
3838200	3839200	Probably both.
3839200	3845200	So I kept seeing her every two weeks for the rest of time, for the rest of eternity.
3845200	3846200	I kept running into her.
3846200	3851200	And we had talked for a good 45 minutes in me doing this bullshit Scottish accent.
3851200	3855200	So every time I see her, she'd walk into a nether bar on a different side of town.
3855200	3860200	And I would turn to whoever I was next to and go, OK, I'm Scottish.
3860200	3863200	She's like, oh, everybody, Melinda, Carissa.
3863200	3864200	This is Jeff.
3864200	3865200	He's from Aberdeen, from Scotland.
3865200	3866200	He's got the best accent.
3866200	3867200	Oh, how'd you do?
3867200	3868200	Good to see you again.
3868200	3869200	I don't want to do that.
3869200	3870200	And it was so tiring.
3870200	3878200	So one day, after about a year and a half of this, I honestly saw her a dozen times.
3878200	3879200	And I kept doing it.
3879200	3880200	And I felt so bad about it.
3880200	3883200	And I didn't want to, like, I wasn't getting anything out of this.
3883200	3886200	She just kept, she loved that I was from Scotland.
3886200	3887200	And I was not.
3887200	3889200	So I'd had enough of it.
3889200	3892200	And so I went up to her and she goes, hey, Jeff, how you doing?
3892200	3893200	This is my friend, Melinda.
3893200	3895200	And so I'm like, hey, what's going on?
3895200	3899200	And she kind of gives me, like, a weird look.
3899200	3901200	And I said, like, she's like, how you doing?
3901200	3902200	I'm doing great.
3902200	3903200	How you doing?
3903200	3905200	And she's like, where's your accent?
3905200	3906200	You know, I'm an actor.
3906200	3909200	And they tell you, like, as an actor, like, you just practice speaking in an American
3909200	3915200	accent as often as possible just to get good at it.
3915200	3919200	And she goes, and she's still looking at me like, she goes, OK, do it.
3919200	3920200	Do your American accent.
3920200	3922200	I'm like, what do you want me to say?
3922200	3924200	And she goes, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.
3924200	3926200	I go, I'd like a cheeseburger and fries.
3926200	3928200	And she goes, well, it's OK.
3934200	3939200	I was so, like, right up to the five inches before the finish line,
3939200	3940200	I was just good at that story.
3940200	3943200	It was going to be called You're an Asshole.
3943200	3944200	Oh, no.
3944200	3947200	That's certainly the title of that story.
3947200	3951200	Because on any given day, like in any bar in LA, there's some fuck face who's like
3951200	3954200	lying to people for social profit.
3954200	3955200	It never got me laid.
3955200	3956200	It never earned me a penny.
3956200	3958200	I profited none off of doing that.
3958200	3962200	It was just I felt it was weirder to just say, oh, I was bullshitting you the whole
3962200	3963200	time.
3963200	3964200	I thought I'd never see her again.
3964200	3967200	And then it turns out we went to the same three places all the time.
3967200	3969200	It was such a weird culture shock.
3969200	3973200	Like, I could barely remember being back in Wisconsin where this never happened.
3973200	3977200	I remember moving from Wisconsin to LA and I remember going out and trying to just
3977200	3979200	hang out because that's what I did in Milwaukee.
3980200	3983200	You just went out and just drank and made friends.
3983200	3989200	And I remember small talking to some guy at some bar because my friends dragged me
3989200	3990200	to.
3990200	3994200	And I was like, so what do you do?
3994200	3996200	And he's like, I silk screen T-shirts.
3996200	3997200	And I was like, oh, that's interesting.
3997200	3999200	I don't know anything about silk screening T-shirts.
3999200	4000200	How does that work?
4000200	4002200	And he's like, well, you take a thing and you do this.
4002200	4004200	And he's describing the whole process.
4004200	4007200	And I go, so then do you mass produce them?
4007200	4010200	And do you sell them through a P.O. box or whatever?
4010200	4012200	And he goes, I'm just fucking with you, man.
4012200	4014200	Whoa.
4014200	4016200	And I'm like, that's hilarious.
4019200	4022200	I'm going to go home and write a hit TV show.
4027200	4029200	Hit in quotes.
4029200	4030200	Hit in quotes.
4031200	4037200	No, it was a really big, I prefer LA culture to Milwaukee culture.
4037200	4043200	I think there's a heavy share of dishonesty in institutionalized alcoholism as well.
4043200	4050200	We weren't good people, but we didn't have a reason to fuck with people.
4050200	4052200	That wasn't recreation.
4052200	4053200	It was for assholes.
4053200	4055200	You called those people assholes.
4055200	4058200	If you caught somebody saying something to someone that wasn't true,
4058200	4060200	that person was just an asshole.
4060200	4065200	And in LA, it's like, but do you see the coolest guy in the world?
4065200	4069200	There's just more people, and we all came from all these different cities.
4069200	4071200	Did I tell you the story about the guy that lied to me,
4071200	4073200	and I caught him in a lie at the drawing room?
4073200	4076200	I don't know his name, so it's not inflammatory.
4076200	4080200	I sat next to a guy, and he was daytime drinking at the drawing room,
4080200	4084200	our little dive bar, and it's like a little cheersy kind of place
4084200	4085200	where everyone knows everybody.
4085200	4087200	Minus the cheers.
4087200	4088200	Minus the cheer.
4088200	4091200	More sadness and more drug addicts.
4091200	4096200	Less of a clarinet and more of a 60-cycle hum that you hear
4096200	4101200	when you leave the eight-inch jack laying in some water.
4101200	4105200	And a slight smell of methane and poop in the air.
4105200	4106200	It's a great place.
4106200	4109200	So this guy was sitting at the end of the bar, and something came up,
4109200	4112200	and so we're talking across the bar about the song that's in the jig box or whatever.
4112200	4113200	So we're having a conversation.
4113200	4116200	So I just scoot down, so we're not yelling, and I sit near him.
4116200	4117200	And we're having a conversation.
4117200	4118200	What do you do?
4118200	4119200	He's like, I'm a writer.
4119200	4120200	I'm a filmmaker.
4120200	4124200	I live up in the Los Feliz Hills here, and I've got a great house.
4124200	4125200	I'm married.
4125200	4127200	Life is fantastic.
4127200	4128200	I'm doing what I want.
4128200	4129200	I'm making these movies.
4129200	4130200	No one watches them.
4130200	4132200	They're kind of for nothing.
4132200	4135200	And I'm usually broke and mortgaging the house all the time,
4135200	4136200	but I'm doing what I love.
4136200	4137200	I'm like, that's fantastic.
4137200	4139200	And he never once asked me what I did,
4139200	4143200	which is a very common thing, having a conversation with people in Los Angeles
4143200	4144200	or strangers.
4144200	4147200	He just kind of went into this monologue about how awesome things were.
4147200	4149200	And so I just kept asking him questions.
4149200	4151200	I'm like, so where did you grow up here?
4151200	4152200	I grew up here in L.A.
4152200	4154200	I said, what did you do before filmmaking?
4154200	4156200	He said, well, I'm kind of a failed actor.
4156200	4157200	I was an actor.
4157200	4158200	I did theater as a kid.
4158200	4159200	I'm like, oh, me too.
4159200	4160200	I did theater as a kid.
4160200	4161200	And he goes, yeah, I was on Broadway as a kid.
4161200	4162200	I said, oh, so was I.
4162200	4165200	And I said, what show did you do on Broadway?
4165200	4171200	And he goes, I'm like, OK, now he's blind because you don't remember.
4171200	4173200	You don't forget the show you're on on Broadway.
4173200	4175200	It was the thing with the guy.
4175200	4177200	You remember the fucking show that you did on Broadway.
4177200	4178200	Oh, my God.
4178200	4179200	So he's fishing for it.
4179200	4183200	And he goes, it's the one with the.
4183200	4184200	It's the one with the.
4184200	4185200	With the tits and the feathers.
4185200	4192200	Now, what he doesn't know is he's now he's now walking towards saying that he was
4192200	4194200	on and also I found out he's my age.
4194200	4195200	He's a year.
4195200	4196200	He's a year older than I am.
4196200	4198200	He says that he's in.
4198200	4201200	He goes, it's the one with the ball.
4201200	4202200	You're better.
4202200	4203200	They go the king.
4203200	4204200	Oh, now that's Jeff Curtis.
4204200	4208200	I was I was I was on Broadway in 1985 and the king and I.
4208200	4209200	So he's I go.
4209200	4211200	And at that point I go, oh, how old are you?
4211200	4213200	Because it might have been a different production of it.
4213200	4214200	He goes, I'm 41 or whatever he was.
4214200	4216200	He's a couple of years old at me at the time.
4216200	4217200	I'm like, OK.
4217200	4219200	So you how old would you have been at the time?
4219200	4223200	He's like, so I guess that would have been I would have been about 11, 12 years
4223200	4224200	ago.
4224200	4229200	And now that your brother was dead at that point because he I was the last guy to play.
4229200	4230200	What role did you play?
4230200	4233200	And he goes, I played the the kid.
4233200	4234200	I go, Louie.
4234200	4239200	Yeah, I played Louie because there's only one white kid in the king and I.
4239200	4243200	The other kids are all the Siamese kids of the king and the prince.
4243200	4249200	And so I'm like, he's like, that's such a crazy thing to say.
4249200	4252200	Also, I thought he was lying when he didn't know the name of it.
4252200	4256200	So I'm sitting there and we talked for I would say a solid forty five minutes an hour
4256200	4257200	about his life and about everything.
4257200	4260200	I learned all this stuff and I'm just kind of reeling.
4260200	4262200	Everything he said has been bullshit.
4262200	4264200	So I said, I see.
4264200	4266200	So that would have been eighty five.
4266200	4268200	Are you sure it wasn't like a few years before?
4268200	4274200	Because and maybe a few years like he goes, no, no, no, I did it with your brother.
4274200	4276200	I played Louie in the king and I in 1985.
4276200	4281200	And I was like, I said, so did I.
4281200	4285200	And he his hair fucking went white.
4285200	4289200	And and he goes, oh, I said, I was trying to take him off the hook.
4289200	4293200	I said, look, when I was doing it and also, by the way, I never missed a performance.
4293200	4295200	So there's not even a chance that he was an understudy.
4295200	4298200	I wondered maybe he was one of my understudies because there were seven of them.
4298200	4299200	Oh, fuck.
4299200	4301200	Maybe he's one of those kids that I don't remember back then.
4301200	4303200	And I said, well, I did it, too.
4303200	4307200	Maybe did you just audition for it because you were constantly auditioning for it.
4307200	4310200	And he just picked up his shit and walked out.
4311200	4312200	That's one of the.
4312200	4315200	And I turn to the bar and I go, what the fuck was that?
4315200	4318200	I said, he told the only lie I could catch him in.
4318200	4320200	He made.
4320200	4324200	If he said he played the black kid in The Wiz, I couldn't have busted him on that.
4324200	4325200	Yeah.
4325200	4328200	And if he said he was run some sugar, I couldn't have fucking got him.
4328200	4332200	But he said the role and the day and the thing, he couldn't name the theater.
4332200	4336200	He was just full of a lot of those people congregate in bars and do that.
4336200	4338200	So I turn to the bartender and I go, did you fucking hear that?
4338200	4340200	And she goes, oh, yeah, by the way, his wife hates his guts.
4340200	4341200	He doesn't live at home.
4341200	4345200	I got everything he said was absolutely malarkey.
4345200	4348200	And so it's a pursuit.
4348200	4353200	And since I've seen him once in a while, he's come back in and he'll see me and he'll walk right back out.
4353200	4354200	Where are we talking about that?
4354200	4356200	There's an actual like we were.
4356200	4357200	Nate, everybody.
4357200	4358200	Nate.
4358200	4361200	We're going to get hydrated.
4361200	4362200	Let's let's.
4362200	4363200	I wasn't going to say anything.
4363200	4365200	Let's use the transition to bring to mortgage out here.
4365200	4368200	The mortgage round, everybody.
4368200	4371200	Curtis hasn't met to mortgage.
4371200	4374200	Right. OK.
4374200	4377200	Oh.
4377200	4380200	Oh, yeah.
4380200	4381200	Yeah.
4381200	4384200	Music choice seems racist.
4384200	4386200	It was it was your 9 11 song.
4386200	4388200	Why is that?
4388200	4389200	No, I'm kidding.
4389200	4390200	Can we get it together?
4390200	4392200	All the missed handshakes and high fives that I did over here.
4392200	4393200	Did I miss one?
4393200	4394200	No, no.
4394200	4397200	Every time people come up, I get one of these and they just go right on by.
4397200	4398200	But we would just.
4398200	4399200	That happened last week.
4399200	4400200	It did.
4400200	4401200	It happens, Curtis.
4401200	4402200	But we did this earlier.
4402200	4403200	People just I.
4403200	4404200	We did this earlier.
4404200	4405200	You hugged me.
4405200	4406200	You know, I didn't just do this.
4406200	4407200	I hugged you.
4407200	4408200	We embraced.
4408200	4409200	Everyone else walks by like you're not even there.
4409200	4410200	You know why?
4410200	4411200	Why?
4411200	4412200	Because you're a tender soul.
4412200	4413200	Yeah. Well.
4413200	4416200	And the mortgage lies with his eyes.
4416200	4419200	And his body.
4419200	4420200	And his body.
4420200	4423200	I love the idea of the mortgage as a bad person.
4423200	4424200	I like that.
4424200	4426200	That is a funny idea.
4426200	4427200	Evil man.
4427200	4428200	He seems.
4428200	4430200	He seems impenetrably decent.
4430200	4433200	I see through all that subterfuge.
4433200	4436200	I think there's a whole like you could make me laugh.
4436200	4437200	Not stop.
4437200	4441200	Just images of the mortgage doing something really fucked up and cruel to somebody.
4441200	4442200	It just seems ironic.
4442200	4444200	It's not the words of the grocery store.
4444200	4447200	It's like kick to this kid.
4447200	4449200	I did it.
4450200	4455200	But that liar guy like this is a like like it.
4455200	4456200	God damn it.
4456200	4459200	I swear I was just talking about this with somebody probably on this podcast.
4459200	4462200	But there was also like this is a thing with alcoholism too.
4462200	4468200	There's a there's a sort of disorder where you start to become a pathological
4468200	4471200	liar. And we bandy that phrase around pathological liar.
4471200	4476200	And we tend to meet somebody who lies a lot.
4476200	4480200	But it's like there are people who truly cannot control.
4480200	4483200	And not just can't tell the truth won't tell the truth.
4483200	4484200	They won't.
4484200	4485200	And they can't.
4485200	4487200	They lie and they lie and they lie.
4487200	4492200	And I think there's some there's some link with alcohol there where like if your
4492200	4496200	brain starts to fucking like if you're like committed to sitting there drinking.
4496200	4499200	That's why you find like at those troughs.
4499200	4503200	They're like there's these guys with a million stories and they they kind of it
4503200	4507200	starts to there's some there's some syndrome where you start to create your
4507200	4510200	own memories and you stack them up and then like you're drawing on those and you
4510200	4514200	don't know it's not the truth except that guy I would be willing to bet in that
4514200	4518200	moment when you said the reason his hair turned white is because he realized in
4518200	4522200	that moment he was lying not so much because he got caught because he realized
4522200	4526200	because he was like yeah oh shit there's no way I'm telling the truth right now.
4526200	4530200	I see I can't I don't know I think that he knew he was bullshitting me from
4530200	4531200	front to back.
4531200	4532200	He wasn't drunk.
4532200	4534200	He didn't strike me as a career drinker.
4534200	4537200	We always think about lies as being like this thing that you use like a crowbar
4537200	4542200	because we have a conscience and we tend not to lie to each other because we feel
4542200	4543200	guilt about it.
4543200	4547200	And so when we look at like sociopathic tendencies as being like like oh that
4547200	4551200	person's cheating and they're using like a thing a tool to open a thing and they
4551200	4554200	can get more shit done than we can.
4554200	4557200	But there's a dark side to it where they can't control it.
4557200	4558200	They cannot.
4558200	4560200	They can't just be normal.
4560200	4565200	They can't feel and they can't be they can't be beholden to this wonderful thing
4565200	4569200	we all share which is this river we'd go down which is like there's fucking truth.
4569200	4571200	Get get on it motherfucker.
4571200	4575200	You know there's there's something else which occurred to me was he may have been
4575200	4576200	lying to you.
4576200	4581200	He may also have been lying to the to the bartender because if she was really
4581200	4586200	good looking he would of course tell her that his wife doesn't love him and he
4586200	4587200	doesn't live at home.
4587200	4591200	Yeah that I don't know but that whole thing I think a lie as well.
4591200	4595200	She had said that like it wasn't that he had unburdened that on her is that he she
4595200	4599200	happens to either know the woman or she knows somebody else that knows the score
4599200	4600200	there.
4600200	4603200	So like like it was like kind of I think semi verifiable that that wasn't the
4603200	4604200	case.
4604200	4608200	Yeah but that's that's very likely I think that he was just I think he was
4608200	4613200	creating a fantasy world that and in that world everything not only is great but
4613200	4616200	also has always been great and always has been different.
4616200	4617200	Oh yeah.
4617200	4621200	And that has to be easy to do in that world because if you're a person who's
4621200	4624200	planted at a bar on a regular basis to the left and to the right of you are
4624200	4626200	people who kind of flit in and flit out.
4626200	4629200	Yeah and they're all looking for you can tell pieces of that story you can lay
4629200	4630200	the game with all you know.
4630200	4631200	That's why you go to a bar.
4631200	4635200	That's why you don't just sit at home and drink like you go to a bar.
4635200	4640200	The idea is this chorus line of linear connectivity that you can choose you
4640200	4644200	could stare forward and drink or you can bother to connect with one person and
4644200	4647200	if that person says I'm a trumpet player you start to feel like you're
4647200	4651200	getting your life done like you're a cooler person than sober people like
4651200	4654200	there's a camera behind the bar pointing at me I'm getting there the trumpet
4654200	4658200	player I'm expanding my horizons but then there's like of course like any
4658200	4661200	biosphere there's this fungus growing on that which is like people who are just
4661200	4663200	like yeah I'm a trumpet player.
4663200	4670200	They're not they're just more alcohol than man weird.
4670200	4673200	What if I became one of them what if I was just like what if I lost my whole
4674200	4677200	life to that what if I was just sitting there going like all right NBC and then
4677200	4679200	I'm a spider.
4679200	4682200	You're a spider? Yeah I'm a spider.
4682200	4685200	I work for NBC and I'm a spider.
4685200	4686200	Tell me more.
4686200	4689200	I got eight legs and then the next time the next person you talk to you like you
4689200	4694200	got the whole spiel about the eight legs going on and you think it's the truth.
4694200	4695200	Let's not do that.
4695200	4697200	Let's just drink at home like we should.
4697200	4704200	Okay the we should start playing Shadowrun and we got no we got no Aaron so we
4704200	4706200	should.
4706200	4708200	Oh yeah.
4708200	4711200	Somebody has nominated himself to play Mercy.
4711200	4712200	Sounds like Adam Goldberg.
4712200	4713200	Think about that.
4713200	4715200	But don't you get him.
4715200	4716200	What's your name here?
4716200	4717200	Jen.
4717200	4718200	Jen.
4718200	4719200	I'll leave it to the audience.
4719200	4721200	Adam Goldberg or Jen that we've just met.
4721200	4723200	Jen to the stage everybody.
4723200	4725200	Jen.

4739200	4742200	No I've been going I think for the past six weeks I think.
4742200	4743200	Wow.
4743200	4748200	I just moved here in the fall from Arizona so I came here with my sisters first so.
4748200	4750200	They're big fans so shout it to them.

4755200	4756200	Oh okay.

4859200	4861200	Can you do Scottish accent?
4861200	4862200	I can't do it.
4862200	4872840	And no I have a girlfriend who taught me there is a mnemonic device like a children's rhyme
4872840	4881560	that takes you through the whole lineage of every monarch of England from the get go to
4881560	4882560	the now go.
4882560	4883560	Yeah.
4883560	4884560	I've heard it.
4884560	4889200	It's like there's a Charlie and Nicky and no get it boogie but it's like I can't.
4889200	4891200	Who could forget King Nicky?
4892200	4893200	Well they do.
4893200	4898280	They truncate them as like Eddie and Chuck and Pookie and Tuck and kind of like Pookie
4898280	4901200	and they're like well that's Peter and they're like okay.
4901200	4905600	It's kind of amazing though like it's a weird day like be part of it like we can imagine
4905600	4910760	being part of a country that's older than 200 years like just weird that you like could
4910760	4917320	like go back until the like almost year zero with like the people that are part of it.
4917320	4919320	Who cares shut up.
4919320	4920320	Stupid.
4920440	4921600	Can I also add one thing.
4921600	4923760	I actually I'm channeling Aaron right now.
4923760	4924880	I brought cookies.
4924880	4926120	I just came back.
4926120	4929560	I got back like two hours ago.
4929560	4931160	I came back down from Mammoth.
4931160	4935840	I was there this weekend and I had the people drop me off here so I could come.
4935840	4939520	So what kind of cookies are they.
4939520	4940520	Let's get them up here.
4940520	4941520	All right.
4941520	4942520	All right.
4942520	4944640	We have we have we have mixed results with edibles here.
4945360	4955640	Who is the guy that brought those Rice Krispies to you like my dog ate a 10 of them and and
4955640	4962320	had to go to the emergency rich dog drug addict hospital because he was high as fuck to recover
4962320	4966440	from my dog.
4966440	4971840	My dog who probably did not learn his lesson because he eats cakes off of the middle of
4971840	4972840	the table.
4972840	4975880	They ate a 10 of pot rice crispy tree.
4975880	4979800	I had I had one of those and I was fucking a ripped.
4979800	4981560	I was really really bad.
4981560	4987280	I had like a quarter of a pan of those and I was just not feeling it.
4987280	4988280	For real.
4988280	4989280	Yeah.
4989280	4995240	I wait literally not feeling I weigh more than Harvey though so yeah but like you're
4995240	4996240	also a pro.
4996240	5001240	I'm a very I'm a lightweight on well thanks on the marijuana.
5001240	5003320	Can I correct you on that.
5003320	5007240	He mostly gets high for charity.
5007240	5008240	It's really a burden.
5008240	5010920	He's not a pro.
5010920	5011920	I apologize.
5011920	5012920	There's no pot in these cookies.
5012920	5013920	I bought them.
5013920	5014920	So that's why I'm afraid.
5014920	5016920	I'll give them to my dog.
5016920	5017920	Yeah.
5017920	5019080	Anyone can have them.
5019080	5023120	I think people were scared that I was trying to poison them or they just don't like cookies.
5023120	5024640	It's always possible.
5024640	5025640	Everybody's worried these days.
5025640	5027640	Everybody's gonna poison everybody.
5027640	5028640	All right.
5028640	5038040	When I say let them poison each other as long as it's not me.
5038040	5040080	See that would have been funny if Nate ran out right then because we would have thought
5040080	5046480	he's a reporter and Dan Harmon soft on poisoning.
5046480	5047480	All right Spencer.
5047480	5048480	You want to.
5048480	5052720	You know the reason why in Milwaukee we can't go trick or treating at night is because of
5052720	5058000	this urban legend about the idea that people put like victimized children during trick
5058000	5063280	or treat and it never happened like the only instances this is like a really impressive
5063280	5067960	thing about our species and our country like two hundred fifty million three hundred million
5067960	5072240	people going for 50 years like all this shit about like all those razor blade in your apple
5072240	5074040	is a poison in your thing.
5074040	5076200	Trick or treat has been going on every year.
5076200	5077560	Kids don't get hurt.
5077560	5082480	The only instances I think the only documented instances of kids getting poisoned or hurt
5082480	5089960	by like tainted or maligned edibles during trick or treat I believe one hundred percent
5089960	5098400	of the cases are a shitty relative of their own home trying to pin fucking child murder
5098400	5104040	on society because they hate their children and they poison like milk duds and kill their
5104040	5109680	fucking kid and everybody's like this is a theory of yours or no there's like only one
5109680	5113320	or two recorded instances when this actually occurred and it's the parents did it to their
5113320	5114320	own kids.
5114320	5117120	I don't think there was any deaths though it's always exaggerated but the kids end up
5117120	5121480	ended up living and sleeping like often like I don't know it's like constantly you see
5121480	5125360	shit and then you go like oh man we're such a fucked up species we're so fucked up but
5125360	5129520	then you like you always carry all this shit in your head like oh a holiday where kids
5129520	5134320	dress up as pokemons and ask for candy man how are you gonna keep people from coming
5134320	5141040	in those how do you know they're not gonna come all over the candy and put acid in it
5141040	5145800	and then come in the acid and then stab them in the eye with a needle it's like they fucked
5145800	5150160	up places where your brain goes remember when Duncan was on and we're like like we're being

5153920	5159040	that kid like because because we're all like like oh kids are fuckable and you should want

5225080	5228600	good people we have our moment are you saying that if you knew that some giraffes lived lived
5228600	5235480	next door to you you wouldn't go trick-or-treating at the house it's not I wouldn't I would not you
5235480	5239200	think giraffes would have that much malice a forethought that they would come all over your
5239200	5246720	snickers yes yes is that what you're saying that yes yes I do or they would eat me they would put
5246720	5252800	something to put some if they're if they're sentient giraffes okay giraffes are such a big
5252800	5257680	gift well giraffes are not sentient they're not well okay if they are then I'm glad that there's
5257680	5264480	none here I I I I don't I would avoid I would avoid a sentient animal like the plague because
5264480	5268200	if they're not if they're not forthcoming with their sentience if they're not going like hey
5268200	5272760	over here I'm sentient I don't trust them do you and that includes these fucking dolphins do you

5288200	5291000	us up and bring us up to date oh yeah shadow run
5299320	5301880	last run on shadow time
5303880	5310280	our heroes had not found Baldwin Brown but were still en route to the neutral drop zone
5310280	5317640	there they met with mr. Johnson who was less than pleased by not having Baldwin Brown in his clutches
5317640	5323880	however Dr. Friend eased him over with an agony spell on himself and after some strict
5323880	5332040	negotiations by uh what's her name Mercy O'Donnell things were smoothed over until the cops showed up
5332040	5338760	it was time to bone out and Eve used a flaming gorilla illusion spell to cover their escape
5338760	5345800	while they boned out in the semi truck with the Johnson but without Baldwin what would they do
5345800	5352440	what would they get paid from will they find him instead all right that's over
5359720	5363640	you know you don't if you don't feel it deserves an applause you don't need to applaud I'm just
5363640	5370760	saying it's fair either way that's how I feel you're in the barons it's early morning let's say
5370840	5375720	three or four in the morning you're in a semi truck full of btls with the Johnson you think
5375720	5380520	you've evaded the cops you're on an empty road winding through fields of rubble towards a
5380520	5388440	building said to be hiding Baldwin Brown oh we know we yeah my eagle spotted him in that building
5388440	5394200	and there's a magical uh mana barriers inside there like uh magic barriers inside the building
5394200	5401320	mana barriers yep all right I can take care of that shit can you huh well whatever
5404040	5410040	don't don't doubt me Spencer okay I believe in you thank you mercy we should drive until
5410040	5417160	we arrive at this place all right I like it are we all in the back of a big truck you're
5417160	5422120	narratively you can be positioned wherever you want it'll it'll all work out as I was confused
5422120	5427960	about that last week yeah well last week so we're one one truck yeah semi truck there's
5427960	5436040	uh they call it the cab and then they call it the holland box I think the bed oh yeah all right
5436040	5442600	I'm in the holland box all right so am I yeah okay I believe hortigarden mercy I think we're
5442600	5451160	up front right yeah you could be wherever you want to be am I using uh my sort of uh my sense
5451160	5456600	of where we are going to get there oh yeah you got a map it's in your brain you know everywhere
5456600	5464840	you're going so we are programmed we will arrive uh according to uh my sequencing uh I would
5465640	5472360	request an estimation on how long before we arrive say what how much time before we get there oh
5473880	5480360	why you're getting there right now say what we are arriving now and stopping definitely okay we're
5480520	5486120	so as you get closer you pass more and more intact buildings run down as they are and also
5486120	5491400	people in the early morning light congregating or standing around in the street small barrel
5491400	5497880	fires cast a warm flickering light across the streets the truck rolls up to a stop um the
5497880	5502040	building is just down the block unless you want to like roll up to the front of it but you know
5502040	5508840	usually yeah so we we don't park right in front of it yeah so that's where you're parked not right
5508920	5515480	up in front of it hortigard can you use your sense to find out uh can hortigard like locate
5515480	5525480	where baldram brown is inside this building uh no but i it's in my collection of mental maps
5526200	5530600	do i have some sort of layout of the of the building available to me not really you just
5530600	5535160	it just looks like a small building should i astral project myself inside that building and
5535160	5540360	try to get uh like sense where the barriers are and where uh where baldwin is who are you asking
5540360	5544920	um the group oh you guys okay with that or you want to try another plan i was going to give him
5544920	5550360	a i was going to give him a uh a strength boost that might help him find baldwin brown who in the
5550360	5560120	building who what's your name hortigard hortigard hortigard hortigard hortigard hortigard hortigard
5560200	5565800	or heta hortigard hortigard like hildig hildigard hortigard hortigard yes hortigard i was going to
5565800	5569160	give him a strength boost do it okay
5577560	5579000	this guy's a really good doctor
5581880	5583800	and with that his strength is boosted
5591000	5597640	i'm sure feeling uh very strong now you're feeling three stronger
5599320	5602680	that's uh kind of a bad neighborhood somebody should stay with the goods
5604360	5606840	not the kind of people you want to valet park with
5610760	5617000	okay if you give my meaning if you astral project uh perhaps i could create some sort of mind
5617000	5621880	meld between us and then we could stay in contact okay while you're going all right i
5621880	5626600	astral project into the building and uh try to try to locate where baldwin is with a mind meld
5627320	5633880	mind meld communication with hortigard okay that happens you're in astral form you uh you glide
5634440	5640040	over the buildings you glide over two large parking structures that are broken and damaged
5640040	5645400	with the ravages of time and in between them nestled in a tiny tiny spot almost too small
5645400	5651960	for a property you see you see a vintage wooden house standing bright and cheery squeezed in the
5651960	5658040	tiny lot you see the house is made out of real live walnut wood planks and a wood shingled roof
5658040	5664120	it's a real throwback to the older times its yard is overgrown with plants and it's glowing you can
5664120	5669400	see it with your astral vision it's glowing as you try and enter the house you're repulsed by a
5669400	5676840	strong mana barrier force it's uh it's it's blocking all astral travel all right uh is it
5676840	5682360	so it's glowing from the from the mana barrier the barrier is glowing right um and there's no
5682360	5691400	way for me to get through that not astral style um attacking barriers uh can i take out like how
5691400	5697320	do you attack can i attack those with my astral uh with my um with my war war club you can try
5697320	5701800	but it's a tough barrier you could tell by looking at it all right well i i use my uh my
5701800	5707560	combat focus weapon my uh my kamachi war club and i try to attack the barrier okay that's all
5707560	5715800	hey you all right you look like you're getting astral-y blocked can we communicate through
5715800	5719720	convalese when i'm astral no you're just a ghost you could talk to hordegard though i would like
5719720	5725080	to relay a question from you what is it are you all right i don't i'm so far so good there's a
5725160	5731800	barrier here should i try to should i try to smack it uh i would smack yes okay okay why would you
5731800	5741160	not i uh i take my kamachi war club and harness my uh my club's uh astral attack on it striking
5741160	5745640	with the astral form of your club it pings harmlessly off the barrier surface this is some
5745640	5754440	higher level magics oh okay i go back to the group for the record he says he is all right
5754520	5760760	yes i'm all right um okay so guys there's a big mana barrier it's magic that's beyond my
5760760	5764680	capabilities i don't i don't know how to get through that oh well you know what they say
5768680	5775720	what do they say night blade bigger the mana barrier lower the uh defense against conventional
5776200	5776600	assault
5782920	5783560	i assume
5787720	5791800	perhaps this is okay can i can i counter spell against it uh no
5793160	5799640	could i give him a spell that would increase his body her i'm a she sorry i'm a girl
5800520	5806920	i'm so i'm sorry it's all right my name is new world i'm sorry i didn't know that you could yeah
5806920	5809880	you have to ask it's a callback you know
5813080	5816680	camera two camera three camera one camera four
5819640	5822120	harmonies brought to you by snuggled fabric softener
5822120	5829800	yeah if you casted the increased body it'd make him tougher to kill and more resilient
5829800	5835800	but it won't help him get through the barrier not on its own no okay could uh perhaps it be uh
5837000	5843560	what is it that you have you have a sort of uh like a light whip yeah whip yeah yeah
5843560	5849400	nano whip in my finger yeah is it is it uh so is that sort of barrier is it sort of uh
5850040	5860360	no vulnerable to it to the whip uh hey okay you look that question up on the future net
5860360	5864760	wait it's called the matrix in this game you look it up on the matrix and you find out that
5864760	5870520	mana barriers are not affected by physical manner does somebody stay here and protect the gear
5872440	5876840	i should head in there it seems like uh also i mean i could go in there i have mana spells i
5876840	5881240	could go in there and cast like a high level uh mana bolt and and try to knock it out that way too
5882280	5885800	but i am getting a little drained have i arrested or do i still have the drain spend
5885800	5891800	nah you're still drained okay i've got a few i have a few bits of drain left in me yeah you're
5891800	5906600	about half so do we know the security system on the outside of the building
5907000	5911720	no you only have seen the wooden exterior of the house oh yeah you're a hacker right
5911720	5918760	like yeah well okay i have a key card copier that's true and i also have an auto picker which
5918760	5925800	i would think would be locks so um i go and inspect the front door or entrance to the
5925800	5930520	building you cross through the green yard and past the yellow mailbox that has the name the
5930520	5936840	yellow man's painted on the side you go up to the front door that's painted blue the woods i mean
5936840	5941640	the paint is shipping it's old as hell but it's a it's a classic throwback lock you could definitely
5941640	5947720	pick it with that lock picker i pick it with i pick the lock all right can i be following her i
5947720	5953320	want to i'm going to go as well because i watched my magic friends fail to so i we're leaving the
5953400	5959960	hauling hauling truck and i'm going to go into going with the physical people i will follow i
5959960	5966920	will follow as well but behind real guard for protection thank you i'm staying i'm staying in
5966920	5971960	the car all right i'm i'm inside the truck but i'm still going to be in the astral plane right
5971960	5977000	now kind of overseeing things i'm telling you somebody should somebody should stay with the
5977000	5980360	truck it's like a joke in an edie's movie we're going to come back it's going to be on blocks
5984280	5989960	it's a bad neighborhood okay this guy likes cookies they're pretty dry but they're good
5992760	5999640	speaking of dry can i have a water it's because of him i've let him nate spencer has one
5999640	6005880	dispenser have a water okay there you go it was in my pocket all right so it's a little warm but
6005880	6010120	it's still what the mana barrier is not covering the outside of the house it's covering the whole
6010120	6014520	house it is it's like it's like paint so what what lock is she picking the one on the house
6014520	6021800	itself front door yep okay so is the chipped paint mean that that portion is down nope i'm
6021800	6026040	in a like paint in that it covered the entire thing i'm sorry that's confusing that's okay
6026920	6032360	you pick the door and it slides open silently which is odd for an old wooden house
6032360	6039320	yeah well is the barrier still there uh well she no no you can only see it when you're in
6039320	6045400	the astral plane no one else can see any barriers okay it's like an astral barrier would like to
6045400	6051160	use my sense of detecting enemies to see if there are any enemies i can't detect you detect two
6051160	6060040	enemies inside but uh with any sort of specificity location or no all you could do is defect i get a
6060040	6065560	number the number is two there are two enemies thanks all right well uh get ready to change that
6065560	6074600	number meaning there are three what what a rare joke from horse the guy no i don't mean change it
6076520	6087240	don't change it randomly i'm gonna change it by killing people this guy i i go back to the truck

6091400	6094920	in there that there's there's a magical force field around this house you're not getting in
6094920	6098280	there well i guess you're talking to friend because everyone else is outside the truck
6098280	6102120	that's right oh i i'm the only one who stayed in the truck not on com links i can't i can't say

6124680	6129240	could have done better i could have done better like you know it's hard because you know we live
6129240	6133800	in this world that just every step you take seems like a step back every time you do something it
6133800	6139000	wants to it wants to it just reinforces the fact that you're not you're not supposed to be free
6139000	6143240	you're not supposed to be happy and like i don't feel like i've never felt like i deserve happiness
