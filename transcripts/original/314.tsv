0	23120	What's up Hayworth Heater?
23120	30120	Harman Town is now in session.
30120	31120	We've got a biggie for you.
31120	33120	Well let's start out with the biggest of all,
33120	35120	meaning the smallest of all,
35120	37120	because he's lost so much goddamn weight,
37120	48120	Spencer Critton, and your game master, everybody.
48120	51120	But the reason for the season is to bring out your mayor,
51120	61120	Dan Harman.
61120	65120	Hip, hip to the hop, yo.
65120	67120	Hip, hip to the rap, yo.
67120	69120	Hip to the hip-hop, rap, yo.
69120	72120	Hip-hop style going to the rap, yo.
72120	76120	Oh, I got my big style, me and Mr. Blue Jeans.
76120	78120	I'm rapping.
78120	81120	Okay.
81120	82120	Thanks for coming.
82120	86120	Oh, yeah.
86120	88120	Thanks, guys. Thanks.
88120	92120	Never going to look at you. Never going to look at you.
92120	93120	We've got an exciting guest tonight.
93120	94120	I can't wait to see him again.
94120	98120	I mean, I saw him. I just saw him.
98120	100120	I don't want to maintain that showbiz thing
100120	102120	where you're like, wow, do they just appear on stage?
102120	105120	No, I know who's here.
105120	107120	And I just talked to him.
107120	109120	But I haven't seen him since I was on his podcast,
109120	112120	and it was a delightful chat.
112120	114120	We'll talk more about that later.
114120	118120	What do I have to talk about?
118120	122120	Okay, so, all right.
122120	126120	I'm not going to play No Man's Sky anymore.
126120	128120	Yay.
128120	131120	I'm back at a modded Minecraft,
131120	141120	and I accidentally one-click ordered a new gaming laptop,
141120	146120	and it runs great.
146120	148120	I love it.
148120	150120	I'm saying all these things with a lot of shame
150120	153120	because I'm like, I don't know how to be happy.
153120	156120	I was in my car this morning,
156120	159120	and I was like, I was going through the audiobooks,
159120	164120	and I was like, I want to listen to a book
164120	167120	about what I'm going through.
167120	169120	I was like, what am I going through?
169120	171120	What did your therapist say?
171120	174120	Coping with happiness.
174120	176120	Well, so I wasn't a big surprise.
176120	179120	That's not like a big book-selling market.
179120	182120	There's nothing. There's nothing.
182120	184120	Coping with happiness, there's nothing.
184120	187120	You get happiness, and then you get a couple hits
187120	190120	that are like the advantage of happiness.
190120	193120	Why, happiness is better than what you're going through.
193120	196120	How to get happiness and all this stuff?
196120	200120	And I'm like, well, none of these things are really for me.
200120	206120	I got one that was like the happiness advantage
206120	208120	because it's like if a guy's talking about,
208120	210120	oh, it's good to be happy,
210120	213120	then that's pretty close to saying, oh, you're happy.
213120	216120	Here's how you deal with it.
216120	220120	But it's not because I paid 20 bucks for it,
220120	222120	and then the guy was like,
222120	227120	I'm going to tell you how happiness is better than you think.
227120	231120	Everyone thinks that if you succeed, then you'll be happy.
231120	233120	First of all, that's not at all.
233120	236120	I don't buy into that.
236120	241120	It happens to be true in my case, but I didn't.
241120	245120	It was my path to happiness, but I realized that that path is not.
245120	249120	So I'm like, okay, I succeeded, so I'm happy.
249120	252120	And then all the happiness books are like,
252120	254120	what's with this success thing?
254120	256120	And I'm like, well, everything.
256120	258120	So I can't hear the foot.
258120	259120	And then I think about it.
259120	260120	So then the guy's like,
260120	262120	I'm going to tell you how it's good to be happy.
262120	266120	Chapter one, I applied for Harvard on a dare.
266120	268120	And I'm like, what?
269120	271120	That's literally how the book starts.
271120	274120	That's the only thing I have to talk about.
274120	276120	I applied to Harvard on a dare.
276120	280120	Don't you know people are going to be listening to your book?
280120	282120	They paid $20 for it.
282120	287120	No one that went to Harvard under any circumstances
287120	290120	paid $20 for a book on happiness.
290120	293120	Most of the people had $40 and were like,
293120	296120	I'll take half of this and I'm going to fucking let it roll.
296120	298120	Like, let's try it.
298120	299120	Something's got to give.
299120	302120	Like, maybe the reason why this $40 isn't $80
302120	303120	is because I haven't spent $20.
303120	307120	It's the most wonderful time of the year.
307120	309120	Steve brought out alcohol.
309120	310120	All right.
310120	311120	I got one.
311120	313120	I got one, you guys.
313120	314120	I've been railing again about,
314120	317120	you know about this war on Christmas.
317120	318120	Yeah, I know.
318120	319120	We talk about it a lot on here.
319120	320120	I think last week or something,
320120	324120	I was talking about what Reese's cups has been doing.
324120	325120	Oh, right, right, right.
325120	330120	But what about these, the newest salvo in the war on Christmas
330120	334120	is these new holiday-colored soda cans.
334120	335120	They got green ribbons on them.
335120	337120	The cokes, they don't taste right
337120	340120	because they have a war on Christmas.
340120	341120	Oh.
341120	343120	They make them taste worse than normal Coke
343120	346120	to make people hate Christmas.
346120	349120	And then they put a green ribbon on it.
349120	352120	That's all.
352120	355120	Okay, who's troll airdropping me?
355120	357120	Oh, no.
357120	359120	Oh, boy.
359120	360120	This is a new thing.
360120	363120	What's your name, sir?
363120	364120	I'm like Atticus Finch.
364120	366120	Who are you?
366120	371120	Jebediah, you're better than this.
371120	373120	I actually, I kind of like that.
373120	377120	It's like the whole world is now a 70s single bar.
377120	378120	We're like a Laverne shirt.
378120	380120	You guys don't know anything I'm talking about.
380120	383120	But there would be like phones on the tables.
383120	386120	Like the single scene would be like, hey, good looking.
386120	389120	I was on a plane and somebody started airdropping me.
389120	392120	Because, yeah, you, okay, so you saw my phone,
392120	394120	and what's it called?
394120	398120	Well, the name is not a famous person's iPhone.
398120	399120	Nice.
399120	401120	Wait, wait, wait, Dan, Dan, Dan.
401120	402120	Let me hit pause here.
402120	405120	You can be on a plane and someone can find your phone.
405120	407120	If my Bluetooth is on, you can change your settings
407120	408120	to not available.
408120	411120	And the airdrop, they interrupt what you're hearing?
411120	412120	Oh, yeah.
412120	414120	You just see it come up and go, oh, so-and-so wants you to hear.
414120	416120	Maybe not what you're hearing, no.
416120	419120	It sends you a notification that there's a picture or some shit.
419120	420120	Airdropping like a photo.
420120	421120	Oh, I see.
421120	422120	I got you.
422120	425120	I thought they were like going to play you some music or some shit.
425120	426120	No.
426120	427120	No.
427120	430120	I mean, this would be, you can see how if you did this while I was in my house,
430120	435120	that would be a federal, because it's just a photo of me.
435120	438120	When you're at a show, it's fun.
438120	444120	But this is exactly what rapists do.
444120	451120	Ten times before they take it to the next level.
451120	453120	It's because it's a photo of me.
453120	454120	And my driver's license is probably in it.
454120	456120	No, but I do.
456120	458120	I like it.
458120	463120	But I remember I was on a plane and somebody started sending me shit.
463120	464120	And it was like random shit.
464120	467120	And then I started, I was sending him random shit.
467120	475120	I project this gender onto a person who would fucking push their way into your phone.
475120	480120	I feel like if I had a guess that it's like a dude on the plane.
480120	484120	And I started, I started, I don't know if that's like a thing where people like have
484120	487120	like photo wars, like in random places.
487120	489120	Like do people do that just to random strangers?
489120	491120	Do you guys like just send-
491120	492120	Always.
492120	493120	Yeah.
493120	494120	In the Starbucks.
494120	495120	What do you-
495120	499120	I want to ask you so many questions, but then you're not miked and there's 50 of you.
499120	501120	So it wouldn't make any sense.
501120	503120	Thank you for that photo of me.
503120	504120	Abed.
504120	505120	Oh, I declined it.
505120	508120	I declined it on accident.
508120	510120	It's a habit because I didn't want to commit.
510120	513120	Like I, I should have saved it.
513120	514120	It's a good photo.
514120	515120	I look very handsome.
515120	520120	Abed texted me like a couple months ago and he was like, these kids, I'm at this subway
520120	523120	and these kids keep air dropping me these naked pictures.
523120	526120	I think they're trying to get me in trouble with the police.
526120	528120	And I was like, that sucks, man.
528120	530120	I don't know if they're trying to call the police.
530120	533120	The person on the airplane that would, they kept air dropping.
533120	534120	Like they were like memes.
534120	539120	They were like pictures of African-American people looking horrible.
539120	540120	Yeah, racist memes.
540120	545120	They were like memes about like daylight savings time that I couldn't even tell.
545120	547120	I was like, I'm not on Twitter anymore.
547120	553120	So I don't know if like it was daylight savings time, like a slam on liberals.
553120	556120	Did we vote against daylight savings time?
556120	557120	That sounds right.
557120	560120	I don't, I, it was like, it was like random shit.
560120	561120	I'm like, yeah.
561120	564120	I was like, I think this person is racist and a virgin.
564120	567120	Like I, that's all I could tell from the thing.
567120	573120	And I just kept sending them just like, uh, pictures of Henry Winkler and stuff.
573120	576120	So people can just send you photos to your phone.
576120	579120	They don't, they don't, they, I want to be clear.
579120	583120	Like just in case everybody's like, what are you talking, like you can easily, you,
583120	587120	you can make your settings so that you're not available to any of that Michigan.
587120	589120	I think I have that setting on right now.
589120	590120	Yeah. And you should.
590120	592120	And like, I, I don't know.
592120	595120	I know I'm not like, God damn you technology.
595120	599120	Like I could easily, there's a get off my lawn button.
599120	602120	So I'm not like mad.
602120	608120	I just changed the name of my phone to not a famous person's iPhone.
608120	610120	That's how you found it.
610120	612120	All right. I'm not, I don't, I have nothing to offer.
612120	613120	Thank you for coming.
613120	615120	You have, you have lots to offer.
615120	616120	You should be pumped.
616120	622120	It's, it's Monday night.
622120	626120	It's, it's, it's the new Tuesday.
626120	627120	Oh yeah.
627120	630120	We should, let's just bring out our old friend and chat with him because there's
630120	634120	nothing I could offer you that he can't amplify and double.
634120	642120	He, he, he's performed at clubs and colleges all across Utah.
642120	645120	He may or may not have recently been me too.
645120	648120	Let's find out.
648120	650120	I can't keep up.
650120	653120	He got me three.
653120	657120	He's the first white male to be me three.
657120	662120	I think the third season of HBO's crashing is coming out.
662120	666120	Dirty, dirty, dirty clean premieres on dirty clean premieres.
666120	667120	Oh, you get the real information.
667120	671120	Dirty clean premieres Saturday, December 15th on HBO and season three of crashing
671120	673120	returns on Sunday, January 20.
673120	674120	Let's bring him out.
674120	675120	You know him.
675120	677120	You like him.
677120	687120	Pete home.
687120	693120	Yep.
693120	695120	The first guy to get me three.
695120	698120	You're the first guy to get me three.
698120	701120	I'm the first guy to get me three.
701120	703120	How do I break it?
703120	705120	Harm in town.
705120	708120	Don't, don't start a sing song with me.
708120	710120	You salty dog.
710120	713120	I'm a UCB trained improviser.
713120	718120	I will join you in any bit, no matter how salacious, no matter how,
718120	722120	no matter how ill timed and boring, because believe me,
722120	726120	if you've really listened to the show, you know, like we could do 90 minutes
726120	727120	of bad musical.
727120	728120	Could we?
728120	729120	Oh yeah.
729120	734120	I wouldn't start it that way.
734120	735120	Wait.
735120	736120	Dan.
736120	738120	That's the first rule of improv.
738120	740120	He's not in the audience.
740120	744120	You are not UCB trained, sir.
744120	745120	All right.
745120	746120	Oh, no.
746120	753120	Let's start.
753120	756120	Oh yeah.
757120	759120	Good day, sir.
759120	760120	Hello.
760120	762120	Why I haven't seen you in a fortnight.
762120	764120	Yes, you have.
764120	767120	I have.
767120	771120	Oh, let me get my spectacles.
771120	773120	Clarence.
773120	776120	Hey, Toby.
776120	783120	I didn't recognize you without my spectacles, which you saw that I polished.
783120	785120	I'm sick of those spectacles.
785120	787120	Oh my God.
787120	792120	I would like a pack of gum.
792120	793120	All right.
793120	794120	We can go with either offer.
794120	795120	It doesn't.
795120	796120	I know.
796120	797120	I know.
797120	798120	I know.
798120	799120	I'd put out two things.
799120	800120	I'm sorry.
800120	801120	That was, that wasn't, that's not.
801120	802120	Sorry.
802120	803120	Sorry.
803120	806120	I liked both offerings.
806120	807120	I've never heard off.
807120	809120	What do you mean?
809120	810120	Okay.
810120	812120	We have bubble tape.
812120	814120	Oh God.
814120	816120	Toby.
816120	819120	Toby, would you, Toby, would you please come into my office?
819120	820120	Yes.
820120	823120	How many times have I told you not to argue with our customers?
823120	830120	Well, I'm sorry, but people keep getting angry for no reason and then breaking character.
830120	832120	Well, stop it.
832120	838120	I'm just showing you how you do a windmill.
838120	839120	This is my area.
839120	841120	It's where I keep the gum.
841120	843120	I would like two packs.
843120	846120	I know your usual.
846120	849120	Tidal wave.
849120	850120	Toby.
850120	851120	Thank you.
851120	854120	And bubble tape.
854120	857120	The funniest gums.
857120	860120	One, if you're laughing, you're 30.
860120	862120	The other we can all enjoy.
862120	863120	Oh wow.
863120	866120	Human feces.
866120	870120	I made them both.
870120	875120	Each of them has a story.
875120	880120	However, each of them will frighten.
880120	881120	I'm sorry.
881120	884120	Each little piece of poop you gave me has a story.
884120	885120	Yes.
885120	887120	And one of them scary?
887120	890120	Both are scary.
890120	893120	Tidal wave story.
893120	895120	No, that's the, okay.
895120	896120	Okay.
896120	898120	Well, I think we're done.
899120	901120	We'll do more later.
901120	907120	That was a great, that was, that's where the training, you're like, yeah, you know what?
907120	912120	What they would like is to stop doing this and that's the actual instinct.
912120	914120	Well, that, yeah, self-editing.
914120	915120	Yeah.
915120	917120	I thought maybe you would run across.
917120	921120	I tried to, but then I had the mic cord issues.
921120	922120	You know, the mic cord was difficult.
922120	925120	That's why improvisers don't tend to use them.
925120	926120	Yeah.
926120	930120	But like, I mean, if we did it without microphones right now, I think our podcast would suffer
930120	931120	or would it?
931120	933120	If we did the show without mics.
933120	935120	I like when things on podcasts happen.
935120	938120	There's a moment.
938120	940120	Well, like just for a moment.
940120	941120	Yeah.
941120	948120	Like when a standup is like, and then my drunk aunt comes over and she's like, what the
948120	949120	goddamn hell?
949120	950120	Yeah.
950120	953120	And you associate distant sound with loudness.
954120	955120	Yeah.
955120	957120	Because otherwise the alternative is like...
957120	958120	How about this?
958120	959120	How about this?
959120	960120	Give me two mics.
960120	964120	You guys, I'm going to area mic you guys and just put your mic down.
964120	965120	Oh, yeah.
965120	966120	And we'll just do one...
966120	969120	I'm going to area mic you so you're doing...
969120	970120	And we'll just do...
970120	971120	Oh.
971120	972120	No, no, no.
972120	973120	You guys are going to do a scene.
973120	976120	I'm going to do like cedar area miking and you're going to have to project...
976120	980120	You said area mics.
980120	982120	Because he doesn't know what that means, Pete.
982120	985120	Pete, you are a UCB trained improviser.
985120	986120	This guy doesn't know shit.
986120	987120	He's from...
987120	988120	Yeah, come on.
988120	989120	But I noticed...
989120	991120	I see you is what I'm saying.
991120	992120	Do we do...
992120	993120	Area.
993120	994120	Do we do a scene...
994120	995120	Yeah.
995120	996120	Just sitting?
996120	997120	Like a radio scene?
997120	998120	No, you walk around.
998120	999120	You want blocking?
999120	1000120	Okay.
1000120	1001120	If I had to say...
1001120	1002120	But how will the mics pick up that whole area?
1002120	1003120	It's not working.
1003120	1004120	No, it's an area mic.
1004120	1005120	Oh.
1005120	1007120	He has a question.
1007120	1008120	Hamburger.
1008120	1009120	Someone said no.
1009120	1010120	No.
1011120	1012120	No.
1013120	1014120	Alright.
1014120	1015120	No.
1015120	1016120	Alright.
1017120	1018120	Chicken and meat.
1018120	1020120	You guys have to be loud because I'm area miking you right now.
1020120	1021120	Chicken and meat.
1021120	1022120	Chicken and meat.
1022120	1023120	Chicken and meat.
1023120	1024120	Chicken and meat.
1027120	1030120	I don't want anything.
1032120	1035120	I'm so happy to see therapy's working here.
1037120	1038120	No, it isn't.
1039120	1041120	I'll tell you why.
1041120	1044120	Daniel, you always do this.
1047120	1049120	And then I told him...
1051120	1054120	Why did you just throw a football?
1058120	1060120	I didn't throw a football.
1060120	1061120	You didn't?
1062120	1063120	Daniel?
1063120	1064120	Oh my God.
1065120	1066120	And then...
1067120	1068120	And then it didn't...
1068120	1070120	And then I kept telling him...
1071120	1074120	Also, for the people listening, I keep doing a win.
1074120	1075120	Yeah, there's like a win.
1078120	1080120	That joke's not going to work with them.
1080120	1081120	Well, you know what?
1081120	1083120	It's unsupported.
1083120	1089120	I am in a different scene than the one that we started in.
1089120	1090120	Oh, okay.
1090120	1094120	And I'm talking to you now as my therapist.
1094120	1095120	That's right.
1095120	1102120	And so I'm explaining to you what happened to me when I was in the scene where I went into a store earlier.
1102120	1105120	Oh, you're the same character, but you're in a different place?
1105120	1106120	Yes.
1106120	1107120	Unless you...
1107120	1110120	I'm like, look, I want you to take part in this, too.
1111120	1112120	Yeah, no, no.
1112120	1113120	I'm just a therapist.
1113120	1116120	I'm not also the guy that owns the gum store.
1116120	1117120	No.
1117120	1120120	I can say if it's up to me, which it shouldn't be...
1120120	1121120	It's up to...
1121120	1122120	Yeah.
1122120	1124120	But my opinion is that you're not...
1125120	1126120	That you're a different character.
1126120	1127120	I'm a different guy.
1127120	1129120	That's why I made a white bee gesture.
1129120	1130120	Yeah, that's...
1130120	1132120	And I have a beard of bees.
1132120	1133120	Oh.
1134120	1135120	Wow.
1138120	1140120	I hope you're not allergic.
1141120	1143120	No, I mean, I...
1143120	1146120	We had this conversation when I agreed to go with you.
1146120	1147120	Be my patient, yeah.
1147120	1151120	But didn't you know I also have pubes of bees?
1152120	1155120	I always wondered...
1155120	1158120	And that's how I got me three'd.
1163120	1164120	All right.
1164120	1168120	I got me three'd showing my beard of bees pubes to you.
1168120	1172120	Now we know it works without mics, too, yeah.
1172120	1173120	I mean, it works.
1173120	1174120	What do you think...
1174120	1180120	It totally grounded your actual speculation of in a world where the hashtag me3 existed
1181120	1184120	It would be actually like...
1184120	1187120	What would the me3 movement be?
1187120	1188120	Yeah, me3.
1188120	1190120	I don't like when people call...
1190120	1192120	You know, there's number one.
1192120	1193120	Like, I go number one.
1193120	1194120	Right.
1194120	1195120	And that's a pee-pee.
1195120	1196120	Right.
1196120	1200120	And then I'm explaining this in case there's someone from Lithuania.
1200120	1201120	Yeah.
1203120	1204120	I know, it's a very different system.
1204120	1205120	And I'm in Lithuania.
1205120	1206120	In Lithuania, they're like,
1206120	1210120	Must be nice to have numbers for a waste.
1210120	1213120	We go in and whatever happens, happens.
1213120	1216120	Sometimes number two is part pee.
1216120	1217120	Yeah.
1217120	1219120	But a number two is a poo-poo.
1219120	1220120	Everyone knows this.
1220120	1223120	But then some people get cute with it and they say,
1223120	1227120	I just did a number three, which means they did a poo-poo and a pee-pee.
1227120	1229120	But who is doing a poo-poo without a pee-pee?
1229120	1230120	Right.
1230120	1231120	That was an emergency poo-poo.
1231120	1232120	Well, when we were kids, we wouldn't have that.
1232120	1233120	What's a number three?
1233120	1239120	It would be like, oh, is that puke, burps, milk coming out of a booby?
1239120	1240120	Yeah.
1240120	1242120	That's a number seven.
1242120	1244120	Well, let me ask you this.
1244120	1245120	Is it about my lactation?
1245120	1247120	Because I told you not to bring that up.
1247120	1250120	It involves it.
1250120	1256120	If you push the button and then you pull the chain.
1256120	1259120	Out comes chocolate choo-choo train?
1259120	1261120	Objection leading the witness.
1261120	1262120	Yeah, exactly.
1262120	1263120	Jeff, please.
1263120	1265120	We're talking about lactation.
1265120	1268120	He's talking about milk, milk, lemonade.
1268120	1269120	Right.
1269120	1270120	So where's your fudge man?
1270120	1271120	Round the back.
1271120	1272120	Oh, okay.
1272120	1274120	Doesn't that throw off the meter?
1274120	1276120	Shouldn't it be around the corner?
1276120	1277120	I say around the back.
1277120	1278120	Really?
1278120	1279120	Yeah.
1279120	1281120	Milk, milk, lemonade, round the back of fudge is made?
1281120	1282120	Corner?
1282120	1283120	What are you, a sex pistol?
1283120	1284120	Corner?
1284120	1287120	I have no angles on my hips.
1287120	1289120	It's round the back.
1289120	1293120	Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner, fudge is made.
1293120	1296120	Milk, milk, lemonade, round the back.
1296120	1297120	Round the back.
1297120	1298120	Fudge is made.
1298120	1299120	It's like your cockney.
1299120	1302120	Round the back, fudge is made.
1302120	1304120	I'm going to fucking slam you with the...
1304120	1305120	It's like a cockney.
1305120	1307120	It's not a civilized expression.
1307120	1311120	It's a working class biological education.
1311120	1314120	That's where you get the fudge is the first draft.
1314120	1315120	By the way, welcome to the show.
1315120	1318120	And do you want to talk about like, who are you and what do you...
1318120	1319120	Who are you?
1319120	1322120	Well, I'm a cockney, Rhyme Smith.
1322120	1325120	And well, I'm Pete.
1325120	1326120	I'm Pete Holmes.
1326120	1329120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1329120	1334120	He has a podcast that I was on a long time ago.
1334120	1336120	You were on a wonderful episode called You Made It Weird.
1336120	1344120	I told you backstage that my therapist, who is known to my audience...
1344120	1345120	Beard of bees callback.
1345120	1348120	Like my therapist doesn't acknowledge...
1348120	1354120	She uses family guy references and then I'm like, you know, I have a cartoon that you could reference it.
1354120	1356120	And she's like, yeah, I tried to watch it.
1356120	1363120	And I've come to realize that she's maybe not nagging me, but is like...
1363120	1364120	Oh.
1364120	1372120	That she understands that if she ever did cross that threshold, that it would lower my opinion of her as far as a person who's under my hood.
1372120	1373120	I see.
1373120	1374120	Which makes sense to me.
1374120	1375120	I get it.
1375120	1376120	Let's talk about that.
1376120	1380120	Wait, because you're big into all spiritual, mental, physical well-being.
1380120	1381120	Yeah, sure.
1381120	1382120	Are you...
1382120	1385120	That was the best heckle?
1385120	1387120	Ignore.
1387120	1389120	Our audiences aren't mixing well.
1389120	1390120	I'm into therapy.
1390120	1391120	I have a therapist.
1391120	1396120	Does your therapist watch your show?
1396120	1397120	HBO's crashing?
1397120	1399120	Yeah, I hope so.
1399120	1400120	And then...
1400120	1401120	Well, what do you mean you hope so?
1401120	1408120	Because you're in therapy once a week, and do you go in and go, it's like that one episode, and do they go, yeah, I saw it.
1408120	1410120	Well, I don't want any spoilers for him.
1410120	1415120	I want to be free to talk about it without ruining it for him.
1415120	1416120	That's not real.
1416120	1418120	I'm asking a real question.
1418120	1422120	Does your therapist acknowledge the content that you create in your therapy sessions?
1422120	1427120	Yeah, because with therapists, for me, I'm looking for surrogate dads.
1427120	1428120	Right.
1428120	1431120	I want someone to say, I'm very proud of you, Peter.
1431120	1433120	You did a good job on that episode.
1433120	1434120	Yes, and if they...
1434120	1437120	I just collect dads.
1437120	1445120	Like, I have a dad, and he's great, but I could use some more.
1445120	1447120	Like, no offense to my dad.
1447120	1448120	No, love it, yeah.
1448120	1451120	Let's get some more of that in here.
1451120	1459120	Like, my mom was so into me a little too much, and then my dad was, you know...
1459120	1464120	My dad calls Judd Apatow, Jeff Applebaum, which is fine.
1464120	1473120	I guess he doesn't need to know what it is that I do, but then I hire other men that are around his age.
1473120	1478120	Who are like, so you talk to Judd Apatow, and you're like, okay, this is like, I got my dad, but he knows...
1478120	1479120	Papa?
1479120	1480120	Yeah.
1480120	1485120	And then we hug, and it costs $42,000.
1485120	1486120	It's not really that much.
1486120	1489120	If you're thinking about going to therapy, go for it.
1489120	1491120	Most of you have been to a therapist, right?
1491120	1492120	Clap if you've been to...
1492120	1493120	Whoo!
1493120	1495120	Because my therapist said...
1495120	1497120	This was a while ago.
1497120	1504120	My therapist at one point, I remember her saying to me, yeah, I wanted to let you know that I was going on a road trip,
1505120	1510120	and I asked my friend to recommend some stuff to listen to while I was driving for five hours,
1510120	1517120	and she gave me this list of things, and on it was you talking to...
1517120	1518120	Is this how she's talking?
1518120	1519120	Some Pete Holmes guy.
1519120	1520120	Yeah.
1520120	1521120	I was like, she didn't know either of us.
1521120	1522120	She was just like...
1522120	1523120	She was just like...
1523120	1524120	You know, like...
1524120	1527120	That, to me, actually...
1527120	1529120	That's unhealthy or not.
1529120	1530120	I do...
1530120	1533120	You like that she poos you.
1533120	1534120	That's...
1534120	1535120	Give me more moms.
1535120	1536120	Yeah.
1536120	1537120	Yeah.
1537120	1541120	Like, don't ever cross the threshold where you're like, I saw it.
1541120	1543120	I saw community.
1543120	1544120	You're brilliant.
1544120	1545120	Yeah.
1545120	1547120	And then it's like, well, so tell me what you're saying.
1547120	1550120	I don't like it when my gardener bitch is too much.
1550120	1552120	And then they're like, okay, interesting.
1552120	1554120	I loved community a little bit, but now...
1554120	1555120	Oh, now it's rude.
1555120	1556120	I don't know.
1556120	1557120	Like, it just feels like I would cross the threshold.
1557120	1560120	You want permission to be ugly, so you don't want to be up on a pedestal.
1560120	1561120	And I like it.
1561120	1562120	I like that...
1562120	1566120	I like in air quotes, but I don't like it.
1566120	1567120	But I...
1567120	1569120	Because I complain about it.
1569120	1570120	I'm like, this bitch...
1570120	1572120	All she got to do is watch the Rick and Morty.
1572120	1573120	Right.
1573120	1577120	But then I think about it and I go, if she did, and she was like, I did it.
1577120	1579120	And I watched Rick and Morty.
1579120	1581120	Sit down.
1582120	1584120	Let's talk more about your feelings.
1584120	1585120	I think something would...
1585120	1586120	I did it.
1586120	1588120	I think there would be a membrane cross that would...
1588120	1589120	I think I wouldn't...
1589120	1595120	Well, you'd be her entertainment Santa Claus, and you don't want to break her heart by being like,
1595120	1598120	I jerked off to a photo of my grandfather.
1598120	1599120	Yeah.
1599120	1600120	I think it's...
1600120	1603120	I think I never thought about it in those terms, but...
1603120	1607120	You want to be, ho ho ho, a new season.
1607120	1608120	I think I...
1609120	1611120	To the people that watch the show.
1611120	1612120	Yeah, that's right.
1612120	1613120	Yeah, you don't want to mix the two.
1613120	1617120	Santa wants a Jewish therapist, is what I'm saying.
1620120	1626120	He wants to go in and go, it's so nice to not have the pressure to be so fucking merry.
1626120	1627120	Okay.
1627120	1628120	You know what I mean?
1628120	1630120	And just cavelled for a while.
1630120	1631120	Yeah.
1631120	1633120	Santa's therapist is Jewish.
1633120	1634120	Is Jewish.
1634120	1636120	Or, you know, none.
1636120	1637120	Yeah.
1637120	1639120	No, it makes perfect sense.
1639120	1640120	I never...
1640120	1646120	It was more about like, I actually have a diseased part of me that thinks about...
1646120	1648120	It's the part of me that wants people to like me.
1648120	1649120	Yeah.
1649120	1651120	That makes me do things.
1651120	1652120	Yeah.
1652120	1654120	So, oh, everybody like me, everybody like me.
1654120	1657120	And then you think about it like, flip that piece, flip that piece.
1657120	1665120	And that idea of like, oh, that person likes me so I can put a pin in them and I can focus
1665120	1666120	on the world that doesn't like me.
1666120	1669120	Yeah, you move on to the other pieces.
1669120	1672120	Do you have a relationship with that concept?
1672120	1673120	Making people like me?
1673120	1676120	An addiction to it, a horrible conclusion.
1676120	1680120	Yeah, I used to be worse about being a people pleaser.
1680120	1681120	I think is that...
1681120	1682120	Yeah.
1682120	1683120	Do you relate to that term?
1683120	1684120	Yeah.
1684120	1685120	An approval addiction?
1685120	1686120	Yeah.
1686120	1687120	And then I sort of started to get over it.
1687120	1688120	Therapy actually really helps with that.
1688120	1689120	Yeah.
1689120	1692120	Like my mother came over, we just had a baby, and the mom...
1692120	1693120	The mom.
1693120	1694120	The mom character came over.
1694120	1697120	She's played by Irena Holmes.
1697120	1698120	She fucking...
1698120	1699120	She's perfect.
1699120	1702120	She comes over and she goes, we got you a...
1702120	1703120	We got...
1703120	1705120	Baby Leela, we got her a book.
1705120	1707120	It's an alphabet book, but it's Cars.
1707120	1709120	And I'm like...
1709120	1713120	I'm like, wow, that sounds like fucking bullshit.
1713120	1715120	But thanks.
1715120	1720120	And then she goes, but we left it in a diner in Pasadena.
1720120	1723120	Could you go get it for us?
1723120	1728120	And we have a one month old baby and I'll just laugh in her face.
1728120	1732120	Not in a mean way, but in the nice way you can laugh in someone's face.
1732120	1735120	I will say like, fucking no.
1735120	1739120	That's not a gift that's an errand.
1739120	1743120	And I think there was a time pre-therapy before I knew what a boundary was.
1743120	1746120	She's like, no, mom, you know, we're taking care of the baby.
1746120	1750120	I hear that you like the book and you want me to like you, but we're not going to drive to...
1750120	1753120	And they made my brother do it.
1753120	1756120	I wonder how much that boundary comes out.
1756120	1761120	It seems like by and large, I don't want to make a generalization that is unfair to anyone.
1761120	1764120	Out there that needs to be arrested.
1764120	1770120	But it seems like having kids tends to bring the best out of people.
1770120	1774120	God knows that's why probably a lot of people have kids that shouldn't because they're like, you know what?
1774120	1778120	I've seen how this works.
1778120	1783120	But it does kind of elevate you in a way that is no conscious choice.
1783120	1785120	Your kid is two months old.
1785120	1786120	Two months.
1786120	1787120	Yeah.
1787120	1790120	Like you're the closest astronaut we have to orbit.
1790120	1793120	If we don't have kids to be like, how much of this shit is real?
1793120	1796120	Like, does it come out and like alter you?
1796120	1801120	Well, I will say that people say it makes you understand your parents more.
1801120	1803120	No way.
1803120	1808120	They're just like, it will make you you'll call your mom and be like, thank you so much.
1808120	1810120	I'm like straight Chris Rock about it.
1810120	1812120	I'm like, yeah, you did what you were supposed to do.
1812120	1815120	You had a baby fucking feed the baby.
1815120	1819120	I maybe I'm in the minority or maybe you just are young and don't give a fuck.
1819120	1824120	That's what I've noticed is nobody gives a shit about your baby.
1824120	1827120	No one cares, especially in L.A.
1827120	1828120	Except for other baby people.
1828120	1830120	And they care too much.
1830120	1834120	I would say it did ruin porn.
1834120	1836120	Go on.
1836120	1838120	Well, I tried to watch porn.
1838120	1839120	She's a girl.
1839120	1840120	But it doesn't even matter.
1840120	1841120	She's a baby as a person.
1841120	1843120	And then you start thinking about how all people were babies.
1843120	1846120	I'm not like anti porn, but it did ruin it.
1846120	1847120	Then I watch porn.
1847120	1849120	You think about body parts differently.
1849120	1851120	You think about breasts differently.
1851120	1852120	I'm glad you brought that up.
1852120	1853120	So I watch a lesbian scene.
1853120	1859120	I'm like, she's got a good latch.
1859120	1862120	What?
1862120	1864120	What does that mean?
1864120	1867120	It's when a baby's breastfeeding, it gets a good hookup.
1867120	1871120	You know, like when Eric.
1871120	1874120	But like pornography.
1874120	1876120	Pornography is weird because sex is to make a baby.
1876120	1879120	I'm not saying it can't be for pleasure, but the point of it
1879120	1881120	evolutionarily is to make a baby.
1881120	1883120	But you never see that in pornography.
1883120	1884120	That's weird.
1884120	1885120	Right.
1885120	1889120	That would be a, it's a, it's a time consuming fetish to cater to.
1889120	1890120	That's right.
1890120	1892120	Like a time lapse.
1892120	1898120	And that's like, I'm sure whether check out Rocco Safridi and
1898120	1902120	Tanya boobs a lot, like there's more turnover with the women.
1902120	1904120	Tanya boobs a lot.
1904120	1908120	And they're like, watch him, watch him raise a little, a little adult.
1908120	1911120	I think that's one of the, not to be gross, but I think that's one of the
1911120	1914120	reasons why the guy never, sorry, this is gross.
1914120	1916120	He never finishes in.
1916120	1917120	Right.
1917120	1919120	I think guys like that on a certain level.
1919120	1925120	You're like, that's hot and very responsible.
1925120	1928120	Well, I think, I think, I think, I think it's same thing.
1928120	1933120	Anyway, I think it's like psychologically men that on a primal level, you think
1933120	1940120	of finishing in as crossing a threshold into connection.
1940120	1941120	A choice.
1941120	1942120	Oh, that's true.
1942120	1948120	And everything being exterior comforts the, the primal male who's like, all I
1948120	1949120	want to do is think about sex.
1949120	1952120	And that's like a big, the big celebration.
1952120	1957120	Because what is, what is, what is really sexy about, about the image?
1957120	1961120	Like everyone agree that it's definitely something we project onto it.
1961120	1964120	It's not the, the Bellagio like fountain.
1964120	1969120	Like it doesn't look pretty, but like it's sort of, I think it like, it's, it's,
1969120	1971120	we celebrate it as like there.
1971120	1972120	See?
1972120	1973120	And I didn't clean my room.
1973120	1974120	I did the opposite.
1974120	1975120	Yeah.
1975120	1976120	No, it's rebellious.
1976120	1977120	And you're also wasting it.
1977120	1978120	Yeah.
1978120	1979120	I'm wasting it.
1979120	1980120	I'm wasting it.
1980120	1981120	Yeah.
1981120	1982120	That's it's like, yeah.
1982120	1986120	I only watch porn where the guy comes into a wood chipper.
1986120	1989120	I just want to see that Fargo blast.
1989120	1999120	That's the only way I can come.
1999120	2005120	He comes into a tiny capsule and it gets loaded into a rocket and shot to a
2005120	2009120	planet guaranteed to never make use of it.
2009120	2011120	That would make men like really happy.
2011120	2013120	I used to have a joke about it though.
2013120	2016120	It's weird that you never finish in the vagina.
2016120	2019120	And, uh, but the point evolutionary is to make a baby.
2019120	2022120	That would be like inviting someone over to your house to make a cake.
2022120	2025120	And you're like, you want to, you want to make a cake on Saturday?
2025120	2026120	They're like, yeah, let's make a cake.
2026120	2030120	And then you get a, you come over on this cake day and you get a big bowl and you
2030120	2033120	put milk and cream and eggs in the bowl and sugar and you whip it up and you're
2033120	2035120	like, we're making a fucking cake, aren't we?
2035120	2037120	And you're like, yeah, we're making a fucking cake.
2037120	2039120	And you preheat the oven, but at the last second,
2039120	2042120	instead of putting it in the oven, you just throw it in their face.
2043120	2047120	Just like, boom, no cake today.
2047120	2049120	Look in the camera and say bang bros.
2049120	2055120	Look in that camera, say bang bros, baking addition.
2058120	2061120	And I think part of the perversion of the male mind is like,
2061120	2064120	and nobody's being a dad today.
2064120	2067120	Yeah. No, I honestly, I mean, don't you think that's really it?
2067120	2071120	My wife and I were trying to have a baby and the first time you do it,
2071120	2072120	some guys love it.
2072120	2076120	Sometimes you aren't trying to have a baby do it in there.
2076120	2077120	It was a first.
2077120	2080120	It was a first for me when I was trying to get pregnant.
2080120	2082120	I'm incredibly privileged.
2082120	2088120	Like I've had like a string of partners who are always like doing this extra
2088120	2093120	shit for me that I don't like, it's like, like, like, you know,
2093120	2095120	the pill is like a big deal for her.
2095120	2099120	But it's like, yeah, somebody said that somebody went birth control,
2100120	2104120	which I get, but like, why not, you know, give it an assist?
2104120	2106120	You, you, you listen to them.
2106120	2108120	I listen to them sometimes.
2108120	2113120	That is going to lead to a, yeah, but that is like,
2113120	2118120	you have girlfriends that are like, they explain their history with the pill.
2118120	2122120	Like I'll be absolutely confessional and be like,
2122120	2124120	there's so much entitlement there.
2124120	2129120	Like I, cause of my history of like, uh, uh, uh, uh,
2129120	2133120	I'm, I'm encountering female partners and their,
2133120	2138120	their history involves them being totally used to like taking a pill.
2138120	2139120	But then, oh yeah.
2139120	2142120	But then you meet like, do you have, they go like, oh yeah,
2142120	2145120	well my period gets all fucked up or I go through all this shit.
2145120	2146120	I don't know.
2146120	2150120	Like I, if men took the pill, it would be 99% of standup would be,
2150120	2152120	it would be, yeah.
2152120	2154120	That it's bullshit that we have to take the pill.
2154120	2156120	And it's like my dick, it moves to the left now.
2156120	2158120	He used to go to the right.
2158120	2159120	I break out.
2159120	2160120	I forget to take it.
2160120	2162120	I panic for them or sugar.
2162120	2166120	And I'm trying to do no sugar right now.
2166120	2168120	No, it's fucking insane.
2168120	2170120	And my wife just had the baby and then she's like,
2170120	2173120	we're talking about birth control because you can get pregnant pretty much
2173120	2174120	right away afterwards.
2174120	2177120	And she was like, well, I can either take the pill and,
2177120	2180120	and have my hormones completely fucked potentially.
2180120	2182120	Or we could, or we could become Amish.
2182120	2184120	Like, like, like, like another one comes right.
2184120	2185120	Yeah, exactly.
2185120	2186120	Or you can get an IUD, which is,
2186120	2190120	I understand is like a mouth harp that a hillbilly,
2190120	2191120	he's just like,
2191120	2194120	thank you for being politically correct.
2194120	2197120	Oh, you want this to stop the babies.
2197120	2198120	And then you have to like,
2198120	2201120	apparently you have to like get all your hand up there and put it in the
2201120	2204120	pelvis and then it works and medicine is like,
2204120	2207120	we don't even know why.
2207120	2209120	It's just a hillbilly's mouth harp.
2209120	2210120	Get it up in ya.
2210120	2213120	We stopped changing the shape when people stopped getting pregnant.
2213120	2214120	That's right.
2214120	2217120	For all we know, it's supposed to be shaped like.
2217120	2220120	Also, people got tired of fucking hearing Cap-chan races.
2220120	2223120	I couldn't get it out clean.
2223120	2225120	That was excellent.
2225120	2228120	Doing, doing, doing, doing, doing, doing.
2228120	2231120	Dude, the only song you can play.
2231120	2232120	Yeah, you get, there's,
2232120	2233120	there's three IUDs.
2233120	2234120	There's turkey in the straw.
2234120	2238120	There's a little brown jug.
2238120	2241120	But my point is, if there's.
2241120	2242120	Bless your heart.
2242120	2247120	If there's a pill, Dan, I give you a pill and you won't turn into a zombie
2247120	2249120	if it bites you, right?
2249120	2254120	And then you go out to eat with a zombie and he's going to buy you,
2254120	2255120	but you've had a nice time.
2255120	2258120	Wouldn't you just stop him from biting you?
2258120	2260120	I made so much more sense.
2260120	2262120	I made so much more sense in my head.
2262120	2264120	What I'm saying is.
2264120	2265120	Let's take that from the top.
2265120	2266120	Take it from the top.
2266120	2267120	Finish.
2267120	2268120	I'm sorry.
2268120	2270120	There's a pill that makes you, that makes you approved.
2270120	2272120	What I'm saying is why not pull out?
2272120	2276120	Yes, the pill works, but wouldn't it work better if that stuff isn't even in there?
2276120	2277120	Right.
2277120	2280120	So there's a pill that the zombie bite won't make you a zombie,
2280120	2283120	but why not just be like, hey, don't fucking bite me because we're,
2283120	2288120	we're having a great time titty fucking anyway.
2288120	2292120	You're saying we owe it to our partners to pull out and come on them.
2292120	2293120	Yes.
2293120	2294120	We owe it to them.
2294120	2299120	Or just come into a wood chipper and fucking.
2299120	2303120	They should make, they should make little mini bedside wood chippers.
2303120	2306120	They do.
2306120	2309120	Petehomes.com.
2309120	2311120	The undominator.
2311120	2315120	I'm just saying is, is it that, is it that much better to leave it in?
2315120	2316120	I don't think so.
2316120	2317120	I've done.
2317120	2322120	Honestly, I have to say it truly is.
2322120	2323120	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2323120	2325120	You didn't let me finish my sentence.
2325120	2330120	No, I have, I have to say it, it, it truly is a matter of laziness.
2330120	2331120	Like, absolutely.
2331120	2333120	Like, like, like men would not.
2333120	2335120	I can't be pulling out all day long.
2335120	2336120	I know.
2336120	2337120	How do I use the weight?
2337120	2339120	I'm doing the pull out method.
2339120	2342120	I'm using a lot of cows.
2342120	2345120	I will speak for myself and say definitely.
2345120	2350120	If, if, uh, if Cody being on the pill, what was also.
2350120	2353120	Are you really on the pill?
2353120	2358120	If she, if she, if she was like, also it's, it's only this and that effective.
2358120	2360120	And it would be helpful to the couple.
2360120	2365120	If you also pulled out, then I would, then I would pull out, but I use the excuse of.
2365120	2366120	Yeah.
2366120	2369120	It's, it's like, it's like you get on a train and there's a bar car and you're like,
2369120	2372120	that means I should drink.
2372120	2378120	No one told you you should, but you're like, no one's telling me I shouldn't.
2378120	2381120	And so leaving it in is like, that to me is like the line.
2381120	2383120	It's like, if anyone asked me to, I would.
2383120	2391120	I would call your lifestyle golden Corral.
2391120	2393120	Like that should be on your business card.
2393120	2396120	Do you think there'll ever be a million man March for me?
2396120	2397120	For you.
2397120	2398120	I think it's on the way.
2398120	2400120	Um, you're in the pill.
2400120	2402120	But what's that?
2402120	2403120	All right. So.
2403120	2404120	Pills in you.
2404120	2409120	You you've, you've, you've been at your, uh, uh, profession for, oh,
2409120	2411120	oh, I'm not going to say a long time.
2411120	2412120	That would be unsexy.
2412120	2413120	I get you.
2413120	2414120	No, but it's been 20 years.
2414120	2416120	You're a fucking warrior.
2416120	2418120	You've been doing standup.
2418120	2424120	You, you, you gracefully, if not acrobatically plunged into the podcast medium.
2424120	2429120	You also survived that into the, into the streaming thing and your prestigious pay
2429120	2430120	cable.
2430120	2431120	What's your secret?
2431120	2434120	I was kind of like, I thought I'd come up with a question.
2434120	2436120	What question would that be?
2436120	2438120	What's your secret would really be the only question.
2438120	2439120	What is your secret?
2439120	2441120	I don't know what my question would be.
2441120	2442120	I want to make that observation.
2442120	2445120	You're like, you're a survivor.
2445120	2448120	I will say though, that it didn't, if it, excuse me, if it means anything to the
2448120	2452120	audience, um, you have to lift with your legs.
2452120	2454120	I once drew a New Yorker cartoon.
2454120	2457120	It was two spiders and they were just, you know,
2457120	2459120	circles with lots of legs coming out of them.
2459120	2462120	And the caption was, um, lift with your legs,
2462120	2467120	not the one part of you that's not legs.
2467120	2468120	That was my problem.
2468120	2471120	When I was a cartoonist, every cartoon I handed them, I was like, that's fucking
2471120	2473120	better than everything you run.
2473120	2476120	Wait, did you just better than everything you run?
2476120	2479120	Were you submitting as a contest entry?
2479120	2480120	Or were you submitting?
2480120	2483120	No, no, I've been in the New Yorker, uh, four times.
2483120	2484120	And you got it.
2484120	2485120	You've been at the New Yorker.
2485120	2486120	Yeah.
2486120	2487120	I know.
2488120	2489120	I know.
2489120	2490120	I know.
2490120	2491120	Nobody cares.
2491120	2492120	It's like my baby.
2492120	2493120	Nobody cares.
2493120	2494120	They, they care.
2494120	2495120	And I do too.
2495120	2498120	Cause I have friends who are obsessed with that and they'll like email,
2498120	2501120	they'll forward emails and go, guys, we got this.
2501120	2502120	Oh, the caption.
2502120	2505120	And I will say, you know what's funny about it is they probably do.
2505120	2508120	I know the cartoon editor, the old cartoon editor.
2508120	2512120	And he told me that for the caption contest, it's like 80% of the time they
2512120	2515120	submit, people submit what the caption was.
2515120	2516120	Oh, really?
2516120	2517120	Yeah.
2517120	2518120	There's a correct answer.
2518120	2519120	Oh, they take the caption off.
2519120	2520120	Yes.
2520120	2522120	Oh, is it just a shitty cartoon that they take?
2522120	2525120	A shitty cartoon is probably a more visual cartoon, but they don't, they don't
2525120	2527120	run the people that got it right.
2527120	2529120	They have to do the other one, right?
2529120	2530120	No.
2530120	2532120	Well, they have three finalists and one of them is definitely the one that was
2532120	2533120	right.
2533120	2534120	Oh, really?
2534120	2536120	But every cartoon is I've known that's had it in there.
2536120	2538120	Usually the winner is what they probably.
2538120	2539120	Damn it.
2539120	2541120	This is a fucking revelation.
2541120	2545120	I, if anyone listening, drop some upper middle class.
2546120	2549120	Do you own a beret or a turtleneck?
2549120	2553120	I'm ready to fucking blow your dick off, dude.
2553120	2557120	Do you remember Phil Waradhan from LA Comedy Sports?
2557120	2558120	Yeah.
2558120	2560120	He, he, this is before New Yorker.
2560120	2562120	It's not before the New Yorker.
2562120	2564120	Look, we're all hooked at Phil Waradhan.
2564120	2565120	Okay.
2567120	2571120	Oh, man, if I was in the audience, I would have loved that.
2571120	2574120	There's a little Phil Waradhan humor.
2574120	2575120	He's probably listening.
2575120	2576120	Now I feel bad.
2576120	2577120	I know.
2577120	2580120	Well, he just drew a two panel comic strip that really, like, that made me
2580120	2581120	really laugh.
2581120	2586120	And it was, in one panel, like, reading left to right, there was a, like, a pair
2586120	2587120	of dice.
2587120	2590120	And the second panel was completely empty.
2590120	2595120	And the title said, Idioms Explained.
2595120	2597120	And it said, Dice?
2597120	2600120	No dice.
2600120	2604120	Fucking, I was like, that's fucking beautiful.
2604120	2607120	Yeah, I like it okay.
2607120	2608120	I'll tell you.
2608120	2610120	But you didn't see how funny the dice were.
2610120	2611120	Yeah, that's true.
2611120	2612120	That's true.
2612120	2613120	What number were they on?
2613120	2614120	69?
2614120	2615120	You can't.
2615120	2616120	How do you have a nine on a dice?
2616120	2618120	You've never played D&D, bro.
2618120	2619120	Yeah.
2623120	2624120	I'll tell you.
2624120	2627120	I thought there was a throw to you wanting to play D&D with us.
2627120	2628120	Oh, I will.
2628120	2629120	That's what you'd play?
2629120	2631120	No, I just, that's what I had cute out there.
2631120	2632120	I like that.
2632120	2633120	I like it.
2633120	2636120	My favorite cartoon that made me want to be a New Yorker cartoon is Bruce Eric Kaplan,
2636120	2639120	who's a Seinfeld writer, great TV writer.
2639120	2642120	He, it was a guy, it's very New Yorker, so we're not going to laugh.
2642120	2645120	We're going to laugh like this.
2645120	2650120	Like, don't move your face and swirl a brandy.
2650120	2653120	We have a walk-in fireplace, like, that sort of laugh.
2653120	2655120	A walk-in fireplace?
2655120	2657120	I can clear it.
2657120	2660120	The height of class.
2660120	2662120	A walk-in fireplace.
2662120	2664120	If you're not shit, if you don't have a walk-in fireplace.
2664120	2668120	Poor people are like, you mean your house is on fire.
2668120	2670120	And they're like, no, it never burns down.
2670120	2671120	That's the point.
2671120	2673120	We're bragging.
2673120	2675120	I have a walk-in fire.
2675120	2678120	He says, it's a man talking to, it's at a cocktail party.
2678120	2680120	He's talking to a skeleton.
2680120	2683120	Skeleton's not holding a drink or anything, it's just standing like neutral.
2683120	2686120	And the guy is saying, so, Helen tells me you're dead.
2687120	2690120	That's 10 out of 10.
2690120	2692120	That's as good as it gets.
2692120	2694120	I love that.
2694120	2700120	My favorite cartoon that I drew that they didn't buy was an avocado.
2700120	2702120	And she had long eyelashes.
2702120	2704120	You could tell it was a lady avocado.
2704120	2706120	She was crying, talking to a male avocado.
2706120	2710120	And she's saying, what do you mean I'm the good kind of fat?
2712120	2714120	They didn't buy it.
2714120	2716120	They didn't buy it.
2716120	2718120	That's fantastic.
2718120	2720120	They didn't buy it.
2720120	2724120	Do you have any idea the creative rage I still feel?
2724120	2726120	I'm mad too.
2726120	2732120	I was born in Wisconsin and I have dirt still in my pants from the farm.
2732120	2736120	And I'm like, I know a good New Yorker cartoon when I hear one.
2736120	2737120	That's a good one.
2737120	2738120	You've done good.
2738120	2742120	But the ones that they bought, there was a guy in therapy and he said,
2742120	2745120	I accidentally repressed my good memories.
2745120	2747120	That was the first one.
2747120	2750120	The second one was a dog real estate agent.
2750120	2752120	How do you draw that first off?
2752120	2754120	Well, it's like you but a dog head.
2754120	2755120	Like it's a human.
2755120	2756120	No, no, no.
2756120	2758120	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
2758120	2760120	Okay, so a guy in a suit.
2760120	2762120	Yeah, the part of you you'd be insulted is if I was like,
2762120	2765120	it's like your fucking face, dog shit.
2765120	2768120	That's the insult.
2768120	2771120	Like the bottom part of you, you're less sensitive about.
2771120	2772120	All right.
2772120	2774120	Human body suit, dog head.
2774120	2777120	I feel nothing from the neck down anyway.
2777120	2781120	And he's talking to a dog couple in front of a house that says sold.
2781120	2785120	And he's saying, well, the paperwork is cleared and the down payments cleared
2785120	2787120	and the paperwork is filed.
2787120	2791120	As soon as you pee on the lawn, the place is yours.
2791120	2792120	These are great.
2792120	2794120	Well, all these got in.
2794120	2795120	I appreciate it.
2795120	2796120	Wait, but wait.
2796120	2797120	They weren't my best though.
2797120	2798120	They were the four that they bought.
2798120	2801120	How did you break into that?
2801120	2804120	I love telling people this because it's hilarious.
2804120	2811120	The cartoon meeting, I love forecasting how things I'm about to say will go.
2811120	2813120	I don't think it's like ha ha hilarious.
2813120	2819120	You have to like, you're going to go like, what?
2819120	2822120	What's hilarious about it is that the cartoon meeting at the New Yorker is
2822120	2827120	at Tuesdays, I think it's at 11 a.m. and anyone can go.
2827120	2828120	That's what's hilarious.
2828120	2833120	Meaning anyone listening, anyone here, go to the Conde Nast building,
2833120	2836120	go up to the counter with some cartoons and say, I'm here for the cartoon meeting
2836120	2837120	and you will go in.
2837120	2838120	Are you fucking kidding me?
2838120	2839120	What?
2839120	2843120	And that is my little revenge for not buying the avocado cartoon.
2843120	2846120	What is the point of being the New Yorker?
2846120	2850120	Well, maybe that maximizes the point because it's like, hey,
2850120	2853120	they should say, here's your New Yorker cartoon.
2853120	2858120	The sub line should say, like, built atop a mountain of poor people's skulls.
2858120	2859120	Of course.
2859120	2864120	Like, here's the cartoon that beat out everyone else that wanted to poke a bear
2864120	2865120	for a penny.
2865120	2866120	Here's what you'll enjoy.
2866120	2867120	Sorry.
2867120	2868120	No, go ahead.
2868120	2871120	What I think is interesting is, so you could go.
2871120	2876120	So the first week that I went, I think I submitted cartoons for sure that are
2876120	2877120	good enough to be in the magazine.
2877120	2879120	I'm sorry to say that, but I'm like, these are good enough.
2879120	2882120	The avocado one is fucking solid gold.
2882120	2884120	Solid as a rock.
2884120	2886120	But here's the thing.
2886120	2887120	That was off mic.
2887120	2888120	It must have been really loud.
2888120	2890120	Oh, my God.
2890120	2892120	Get in the clean your room, Jacob.
2892120	2894120	That is fun.
2894120	2896120	You're fun, Golden Corral.
2896120	2899120	All right.
2899120	2906120	I don't like the shift in status, but continue.
2906120	2908120	Regained by calling it out.
2908120	2909120	Yes.
2909120	2910120	Now I'm on top again.
2910120	2911120	Now you're on top again.
2911120	2912120	You're a meta alpha.
2912120	2913120	I love your meta alpha.
2913120	2915120	Golden Corral is a compliment, though, right?
2915120	2916120	Yeah.
2916120	2917120	I don't remember.
2917120	2918120	It kind of sounds like a fat joke.
2918120	2922120	I mean it that you live life and you eat and you're fat.
2922120	2927120	It was a good...
2927120	2928120	Good save.
2928120	2929120	No, no, no.
2929120	2931120	I mean it at the buffet of life.
2931120	2932120	You're getting seconds.
2932120	2933120	That's what I mean.
2933120	2937120	No, but Dan, you're the good kind of fat.
2937120	2943120	That's why you're solid.
2943120	2944120	Everyone's dancing.
2944120	2947120	Solid as a rock.
2947120	2948120	Spanking.
2948120	2951120	Ain't no law changes.
2951120	2952120	Wow.
2952120	2953120	iTunes.
2953120	2954120	And I could hear.
2954120	2958120	This just got written up on splitsider.
2958120	2959120	I don't know.
2959120	2962120	Is there any room anymore for...
2962120	2965120	Could we ever make that...
2965120	2970120	Is there anything a comedy podcast could do these days that would actually end up in
2970120	2975120	anyone's Apple news update with a headline that said, Pete Holmes just...
2975120	2977120	Nothing good.
2977120	2980120	The word just is so important.
2980120	2988120	Someone just did this and it was epic and you'll come your brain and your dick knows.
2988120	2991120	Yeah, no.
2992120	2997120	Normally newspapers would just be like, a guy does a thing that you don't care about.
2997120	2999120	So it's on page four and it's all part of...
2999120	3002120	That's why it's called the paper.
3002120	3004120	And now everything is just like, just, just.
3004120	3005120	Someone just.
3005120	3008120	This just, epic just.
3008120	3009120	This just happened.
3009120	3010120	Just.
3010120	3011120	I can't...
3011120	3014120	You won't believe epic just.
3014120	3020120	But a lot of it is just like, Tom Hanks' uncle just decided he's a DJ.
3021120	3024120	And it's only because...
3024120	3025120	Actually, that sounds...
3025120	3027120	Actually, that's the bad example.
3027120	3028120	That is...
3028120	3029120	That's great.
3029120	3030120	That is a headline that I would...
3030120	3032120	That's perfect.
3032120	3033120	What I was gonna say.
3033120	3034120	All right.
3034120	3035120	Yeah, you were under the...
3035120	3036120	I didn't interrupt you.
3036120	3037120	What I was gonna say.
3037120	3038120	You guys interrupted...
3038120	3039120	No, no, you didn't interrupt.
3039120	3040120	Go ahead.
3040120	3041120	You're great.
3041120	3042120	Keep talking.
3042120	3043120	I think you'll think this is interesting.
3043120	3044120	From showbiz.
3044120	3045120	Showbiz perspective.
3045120	3048120	You could have the best cartoon in the world.
3048120	3050120	A single panel cartoon.
3050120	3051120	Perfectly drawn.
3051120	3052120	Perfect caption.
3052120	3053120	Funniest caption in the world.
3053120	3054120	You show it to anybody.
3054120	3055120	Any...
3055120	3058120	10 out of 10 people are gonna shit their pants laughing at this cartoon.
3058120	3059120	They won't buy it.
3059120	3064120	The New Yorker has enough cartoons to never buy a cartoon again.
3064120	3066120	And they could run for 50 years.
3066120	3067120	Shut up.
3067120	3068120	And just run their backlog.
3068120	3069120	Wait.
3069120	3070120	So they don't want cartoons.
3070120	3071120	They want cartoonists.
3071120	3075120	So I went in every week for six months.
3075120	3078120	That's hundreds of cartoons before they bought one.
3078120	3079120	And that was even...
3079120	3083120	Jack Ziegler, rest in peace, one of the greats of the New Yorker, put in a good word for
3083120	3086120	me, because I'm that kind of guy that'll go up to somebody and be like,
3086120	3087120	Hey, I'm new in town.
3087120	3088120	Help me.
3088120	3090120	I'm a John Mulaney spiritual.
3090120	3092120	But I have a thousand questions.
3092120	3093120	I don't understand.
3093120	3095120	Do they buy them or do they not buy?
3095120	3096120	Are you saying...
3096120	3097120	No, they'll bank some of them.
3097120	3101120	They create an industry of everyone's always auditioning, so their supply never runs out
3101120	3102120	and they don't have to pay for it.
3102120	3103120	That's what you're saying.
3103120	3104120	It's like wire image.
3104120	3106120	They have a bank of all these photos.
3106120	3108120	And if they want to use one eventually...
3108120	3110120	But they do pay for it.
3110120	3112120	They pay when they use them or they pay...
3112120	3114120	No, they buy it and then they own it.
3114120	3116120	And for the most part, they run them.
3116120	3120120	But let's say you're an on-salary cartoonist.
3120120	3121120	You give me 300 cartoons.
3121120	3123120	Maybe we run 250 of them.
3123120	3126120	Every year, we're getting 50 of your cartoons on the backlog.
3126120	3129120	And that's been happening since, like, 1909 when the magazine started.
3129120	3133120	When all the cartoons were, like, racist.
3133120	3137120	When the New Yorker was like...
3137120	3142120	But you said you had, like, four cartoons published in New York.
3142120	3143120	Yeah, and they published all of them.
3143120	3144120	Yeah, I was fortunate.
3144120	3146120	So are you bragging?
3146120	3147120	No, no, no.
3147120	3151120	Because you didn't have to do, like, 5, 8, 9...
3151120	3154120	I think it's more of the salary guys that might get archived.
3154120	3155120	But they have these meetings...
3155120	3157120	I'm sorry, I'm asking so many questions about this.
3157120	3158120	It's a podcast.
3158120	3161120	What is this, a podcast?
3161120	3162120	It's just like...
3162120	3165120	Pete Holmes just redefined podcasts.
3165120	3169120	This meeting that you're describing where they go, like, they open the doors
3169120	3172120	and you're like, you could go to Conde Nast and you show up and people, like,
3172120	3175120	come in in trench coats with, like, these books and go, like,
3175120	3178120	well, here's a guy fishing for his shark, but it's, like, Wall Street and, like...
3178120	3179120	Right.
3179120	3181120	Like, is everyone just showing cartoons?
3181120	3183120	And some of them have, like, doves on their shoulders?
3183120	3186120	Well, you're picturing it not entirely wrong, actually.
3186120	3188120	There's a lot of, like, Connecticut train weirdos.
3188120	3190120	I don't know why I said doves, pigeons.
3190120	3191120	Connecticut?
3191120	3193120	Yeah, Connecticut will take anything.
3193120	3197120	I said Connecticut train weirdos and he went, whoo!
3197120	3201120	Now, Pete, did you ever want to be, like, a syndicated comic strip guy?
3201120	3205120	Like, have a syndicated thing across, like, major papers across the state?
3205120	3208120	Oh, yeah, Calvin and Hobbes was a game change.
3208120	3210120	Let's do a podcast first.
3210120	3214120	Let's improvise a three-panel comic strip.
3214120	3215120	Okay.
3215120	3217120	But is it, like, a funny or is it a slice of life?
3217120	3220120	Well, it's probably gonna be the latter.
3220120	3222120	Slice of...
3222120	3223120	Well, because we have to...
3223120	3225120	So, let's get a title.
3225120	3229120	The title is Good and Butter.
3229120	3231120	Good and Butter.
3231120	3232120	Good and Butter.
3232120	3233120	All right.
3233120	3238120	It's because it's a husband and...
3238120	3241120	Well, you can't say the name of it and tell me what it means.
3241120	3242120	Oh, well, no.
3242120	3243120	Okay.
3243120	3244120	I didn't mean...
3244120	3245120	I thought...
3245120	3246120	Okay.
3246120	3247120	All right.
3247120	3248120	I didn't mean to slap your leg.
3248120	3249120	No, no, no.
3249120	3250120	Let's find out why it's called Good and Butter by doing the panel.
3250120	3251120	Wait, hang on.
3251120	3252120	Am I the third panel?
3252120	3253120	Are you guys gonna do...
3253120	3254120	I thought we explained what's in each panel.
3254120	3256120	Oh, no, no, no.
3256120	3263120	Here's the rules to this new improv game that I made that if anybody uses, they owe me
3263120	3264120	money.
3264120	3265120	That's how improv is.
3265120	3267120	That's how they all made their millions.
3268120	3271120	I'm rich off inventing freeze tech.
3271120	3274120	It goes from audience left to audience right.
3274120	3278120	By the time you run out of stage space, you're out of comic panel.
3278120	3279120	Right.
3279120	3284120	You get to do one line and then if there's someone you're talking to...
3284120	3288120	You need to do a line and so it's like hieroglyphic, there's no...
3288120	3289120	Yeah.
3289120	3291120	So I say like...
3291120	3292120	I get it.
3292120	3295120	Hey, I'm almost done with that lawnmower.
3295120	3296120	Right.
3296120	3301120	And I would be like, well, it took you all day to mow the damn grass.
3301120	3304120	And then you'd like draw a line.
3304120	3305120	Yeah.
3305120	3307120	And then now it's on me.
3307120	3308120	This is panel two now.
3308120	3309120	Yeah.
3309120	3310120	Yeah.
3310120	3311120	That's the tough part.
3311120	3312120	Let's workshop that later.
3312120	3316120	But then I'd go, listen.
3317120	3320120	I've been noticing that...
3326120	3332120	You want me to work faster when I use your property.
3338120	3340120	Are you telling the truth?
3340120	3345120	You have to do the wipe to make sure.
3345120	3346120	Right.
3346120	3347120	And then it's a wipe.
3347120	3352120	I am in the Trump administration.
3352120	3353120	And you don't have to do anything.
3353120	3354120	Then we did it.
3354120	3355120	We did it.
3355120	3356120	I don't know.
3356120	3357120	All right.
3357120	3358120	No?
3358120	3359120	All right.
3359120	3360120	I thought that was...
3360120	3361120	I liked it.
3361120	3362120	Yeah.
3362120	3363120	I loved it.
3363120	3364120	Otherwise I'd be hanging...
3364120	3365120	You have to dry, right?
3365120	3366120	If I was like, you tell me.
3366120	3367120	And then you'd be like, what the fuck?
3367120	3370120	You have to say you're telling fertilizer.
3370120	3371120	Oh.
3371120	3372120	All right.
3372120	3373120	Well...
3373120	3374120	No, no, no.
3374120	3377120	It wasn't good, but I had a backup plan.
3377120	3380120	Like pulling out when you're on the pill.
3380120	3381120	Yeah.
3381120	3382120	Yeah.
3382120	3385120	That was early good and butter, but do some of my favorite ones.
3385120	3387120	Do some of my classic butter.
3387120	3389120	Can I ask a podcast question?
3389120	3390120	Yeah, yeah.
3390120	3394120	Is there usually this much improv?
3394120	3395120	It depends.
3395120	3399120	Only when you come out talking shit about your UCB training.
3399120	3402120	No, we should get to the scripted part of the show.
3402120	3403120	You're right.
3403120	3404120	You're right.
3404120	3409120	So, Pete, I hear Blue Apron is the secret to your comedic success.
3409120	3411120	Is that your sponsor?
3411120	3412120	Oh, yeah.
3412120	3417120	We love the caramelized pearl onions with peas cabbage.
3417120	3424120	Did season three of Crashing go so much good because you like things the way you like them?
3424120	3427120	Like the way people order Blue Apron?
3427120	3431120	Well, what we do on Crashing is we write a script and then we wrap it in...
3431120	3435120	That sounds great.
3435120	3442120	Is it true they can get a discount if they use the code Pete Holmes dot Blue Apron dot slash Harman?
3442120	3443120	I don't think that'll do anything.
3443120	3444120	Oh, yeah.
3444120	3448120	No, that sounds like it'll take your web browser to something.
3448120	3449120	Blue Apron.
3449120	3454120	I hate your guilt about all that packaging away.
3454120	3455120	Feel free to edit that out.
3455120	3456120	I know what it's like having sponsors.
3456120	3461120	Here's a real question I wanted to ask you because you just had a two-year-old, two-month-old.
3461120	3467120	To me, babies are no younger than two years old.
3467120	3469120	You just had a two-year-old.
3469120	3470120	You're picturing it right.
3470120	3471120	You have a two-month-old.
3471120	3472120	Yeah, two months.
3472120	3475120	Fresh, fresh as the fucking morning bread.
3475120	3476120	Where was she?
3477120	3478120	You're like...
3478120	3481120	But I assume I haven't watched your show.
3481120	3486120	It sounds from the description that it's probably every television show ever made
3486120	3488120	in that it's not you...
3488120	3495120	Is it you doing stand-up and it's the Mindy Project but you're a white dude?
3497120	3498120	I'm just making a guess.
3498120	3501120	Can we please put that on the DVD box?
3502120	3505120	It's the Mindy Project but I'm a white dude.
3506120	3507120	And he's not a doctor.
3507120	3510120	I also can't quite figure it out.
3510120	3512120	But is it...
3512120	3514120	Here, let me rephrase that.
3514120	3516120	Please.
3516120	3522120	Is your show about a single dude finding life and love in a coastal city or is it your show
3522120	3523120	about a dude who's already married?
3523120	3526120	And in either case, I have another question.
3526120	3534120	Yeah, it was disturbing how you kind of summarized all of TV just then because it's fair.
3535120	3536120	Yeah, no.
3536120	3537120	It's a guy who was married.
3537120	3538120	It's based on me.
3538120	3539120	I was married when I was 28.
3539120	3545120	My wife had an affair with a small Italian man named Rocco, which is a name you said
3545120	3546120	earlier.
3546120	3547120	Rocco Safridi.
3547120	3549120	Yeah, as a porno name.
3549120	3551120	And Big Boobs, Booby Boobs or whatever it was.
3551120	3553120	Yeah, because the turnover rate with...
3553120	3556120	It was something boobs a lot.
3556120	3557120	I know that.
3557120	3558120	Let's go all the way back.
3558120	3561120	Warner Fudge is made.
3561120	3563120	Me three.
3563120	3564120	Okay.
3564120	3567120	Your first wife left you for a fellow named Rocco.
3567120	3568120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3568120	3569120	Wow.
3569120	3570120	Yeah, Rocco.
3570120	3571120	Nice guy, actually.
3571120	3573120	I'm not just saying that.
3573120	3574120	He was a really sweet guy.
3574120	3575120	I really like him.
3575120	3580120	So the show is kind of a flashback to a portrait of you when you were single.
3580120	3581120	Yes.
3581120	3582120	You know, it's funny.
3582120	3585120	A lot of TV and movies start with an affair.
3585120	3587120	Our pilot has an affair.
3587120	3590120	I mean, you know, we talked about Joey Cams, Joseph Campbell.
3590120	3591120	You need that inciting thing.
3591120	3595120	And in my case, my life really had that thing.
3595120	3597120	I was in the shallow end of comedy.
3597120	3600120	My wife leaves everything that I knew, fell away.
3600120	3603120	And then I was like sort of forced into the deep end.
3603120	3609120	And the conceit is there are all these Obi-Wan type characters like Artie Lang, Bill Burr,
3609120	3613120	Sarah Silverman that sort of shepherd me and teach me because they think it's sweet.
3613120	3615120	A lot of people thought I was like a sweetie.
3615120	3617120	And they were like, look at this yokel.
3617120	3619120	And he's religious.
3619120	3621120	And he's sweeter than the scene.
3621120	3622120	We're going to help him out.
3622120	3624120	That actually happened quite a bit.
3624120	3630120	And so it's kind of like, but you're currently, you're partners with this person.
3630120	3633120	And now you've created a life as of two months ago.
3633120	3637120	My question has to do with having a successful show that's going to keep on running.
3637120	3645120	And now as creators, our big fantasy is like write what you know, write what you know.
3645120	3647120	And then you create this thing.
3647120	3649120	And it's about us.
3649120	3650120	And it's about me and all this stuff.
3650120	3655120	And my question is always, how do you cope with that three seasons into it when you're
3655120	3663120	now coming home to a California king's eyes bed with a person who is like,
3663120	3671120	what is the relationship between you and your partner with the show?
3671120	3677120	When the show is about you, it's about you being single, right?
3677120	3678120	The show.
3678120	3680120	The show is not about you being married.
3680120	3683120	The show is about you dating, right?
3683120	3685120	I'm asking because I don't know.
3685120	3686120	I feel like I was...
3686120	3688120	Whoa, whoa, whoa, Golden Corral.
3688120	3689120	Take it easy.
3689120	3691120	I'm confirming that first of all.
3691120	3697120	And then my question is like, how does that work?
3697120	3699120	I think I hear you.
3699120	3702120	I think I hear you.
3702120	3710120	My show, my wife, my new wife, but Valerie, we've been married for almost a year now.
3710120	3713120	We've been together for over five, six years.
3713120	3714120	And we have the baby.
3714120	3718120	And I'm currently making a show reenacting my old marriage.
3718120	3719120	Right.
3719120	3725120	And then also the girl, the woman who's one of our best friends as a couple, Jamie Lee,
3725120	3728120	who plays my girlfriend on the show is actually my ex-girlfriend.
3728120	3732120	So when we talk about how spectacular and loving Valerie is,
3732120	3736120	it's not that I'm just like making believe of the past with actors.
3736120	3739120	I'm actually making believe of the past with my ex-girlfriend.
3739120	3741120	So she's tremendous.
3741120	3743120	She's actually winning an Emmy this year.
3743120	3745120	The support of wife Emmy.
3745120	3746120	Is that what you meant?
3746120	3750120	I kind of, but now I have eight more questions because I, wait,
3750120	3752120	didn't you, is your ex-girlfriend?
3752120	3756120	Did that, do you think that answered his question?
3756120	3757120	No, because didn't you-
3757120	3761120	Don't act like you were clear on his question.
3761120	3764120	I listened to people for a living.
3764120	3775120	And that was like a tour through a Walmart that sold words, but there was an earthquake.
3776120	3783120	I want to separate it from like, if I wanted to be like a thoughtful interviewer,
3783120	3785120	it'd be like, I would have watched the show and be like,
3785120	3787120	No, don't feel that way.
3787120	3793120	I'm saying as a creator who I assume, like you're doing a show,
3793120	3795120	is the character named Pete?
3795120	3796120	Yeah.
3796120	3797120	So is he a standup?
3797120	3798120	Yeah.
3798120	3801120	So that's my question is like, we all do that.
3801120	3803120	Like we tell-
3803120	3805120	Does he jerk off to his grandpa?
3805120	3806120	That was him.
3806120	3807120	Okay.
3807120	3813120	And my question, I think you kind of, you could talk about this for more,
3813120	3815120	is like-
3815120	3820120	The more you drink, the more you sound like Robert Crumb.
3820120	3824120	You can talk about this for a lot of comics.
3824120	3830120	Is that, just that general area, I don't have the smart question about it
3830120	3832120	because I haven't seen the show or-
3832120	3833120	You're doing wonderful.
3833120	3834120	You can ask me anything.
3834120	3835120	We're friends.
3835120	3838120	Don't patronize me.
3838120	3840120	I'm a good interviewer.
3840120	3842120	You're doing great.
3842120	3847120	It's that, I'm just curious about your personal,
3847120	3850120	and if I'm prying, then you just go, don't pry,
3850120	3855120	but having a partner in your life and you go like,
3855120	3860120	I've known, it's like 50 comics who like every,
3860120	3862120	like my show's called Franklin.
3862120	3864120	And what's the show about?
3864120	3867120	Well, it's about the fact that I'm Franklin and their name is Franklin.
3867120	3871120	And it's like, well, it's about growing up in the Bronx and being married to a-
3871120	3875120	And it's like, well, okay, so a lot of that is obviously based on the things
3875120	3878120	you talked about in your act, and therefore now that's based on your life.
3878120	3885120	And my, that's my curiosity is these conversations that have to happen
3885120	3889120	when you come home from work or you watch something together
3889120	3895120	and the challenges that your partner goes through where they're like,
3895120	3901120	is that about me or is that about your cousin Amy or what's going on here?
3901120	3903120	Or is that real? Yeah.
3903120	3905120	Did that happen? Do you feel that way?
3905120	3912120	Yeah, I suppose the whole process, if I'm hearing you correctly-
3912120	3914120	Pete, it was a yes or no question.
3915120	3919120	All right. All right. Well.
3921120	3924120	I feel like I could answer in the style in which I was asked.
3924120	3925120	Yes, yes.
3927120	3931120	You know, when you're making a show like this that is oftentimes autobiographical,
3931120	3936120	but not without its fiction, you know, you take deviations into different roads
3936120	3939120	and the roads become avenues and some of them become cul-de-sacs
3939120	3941120	and send you back the way you came.
3941120	3945120	But when you're looking over that hill and there's somebody like your partner
3945120	3949120	and they're wondering, is this like, is this something we watch together?
3949120	3952120	Is this something like The Sopranos where we cook a meal
3952120	3954120	and we eat the meal and we watch it?
3954120	3960120	Or is it more like a theme show or a barbecue kind of night off of nudity
3960120	3963120	and why do you keep coming in this wood chipper?
3965120	3967120	That's the best impression of me.
3968120	3973120	I've always wanted, I'm like, James Adomian, will you ever do an impression of me?
3973120	3976120	It's like, no, I would never dirty my hands with that.
3976120	3978120	That was the first impression I've ever made of me.
3978120	3979120	Is that right?
3979120	3980120	That was fantastic.
3980120	3981120	Somebody sent me a clip of someone, was it you?
3981120	3984120	It's fine if it was, doing an impression of me on this podcast.
3984120	3985120	I don't think so.
3985120	3986120	Any die-hard fans remember that?
3986120	3989120	If I did an impression of you, it would be like, I'm a great guy.
3989120	3993120	Well, it was very sweet, actually. It was somebody-
3993120	3994120	Do you want a vegan cookie?
3995120	3997120	I have a show on HBO.
3999120	4002120	Hey, it's me. It's me, I'm Pete Holmes.
4004120	4008120	If I don't seem very dimensionalized, it might be because you have clinical narcissism.
4011120	4013120	Maybe you don't see anybody as a human.
4013120	4015120	Oh, that's so fun.
4015120	4017120	Maybe everyone's of color for him to you.
4017120	4020120	That is brutally honest.
4021120	4026120	Pete, the first time I met you, I think, we were doing Douglas movies at the UCB,
4026120	4028120	and it was me, you, and Bill Burr.
4032120	4033120	That's my Bill Burr impression.
4033120	4034120	That's really good.
4039120	4040120	No, I'm serious.
4040120	4042120	So I don't watch any current movies.
4042120	4046120	My knowledge of movies is way old, so I'm not going to be good at it.
4046120	4049120	And Doug is smoking weed in the back, of course.
4049120	4051120	Suspend your disbelief for that part.
4052120	4054120	And I sit down and I meet Bill Burr.
4054120	4055120	I'm like, oh, hey, Bill.
4055120	4056120	And he goes, I'm Jeff.
4056120	4058120	He goes, hey, how's it going?
4058120	4061120	And he goes, hey, Jeff, we're doing a show with Pete Holmes,
4061120	4063120	so you and I are never going to talk.
4065120	4066120	That's about right.
4066120	4068120	But the thing was, it was the best thing in the world
4068120	4072120	because I don't know fuck anything about movies.
4072120	4073120	What's currently in theaters.
4073120	4074120	Neither do I.
4074120	4077120	But you just got up and just completely dominated the whole thing.
4077120	4078120	I don't want to get to the game.
4078120	4079120	Me neither.
4079120	4080120	But you took me.
4080120	4081120	I didn't have to play the game.
4081120	4085120	And my gift to the audience member was a flask full of really nice whiskey.
4085120	4088120	And that was my offer to whoever voted for me at the end of the thing.
4088120	4089120	Oh, that's funny.
4089120	4090120	Did they get to keep the flask?
4090120	4094120	No, because while you were talking, Bill and I just opened it up
4094120	4095120	and drank the entire thing.
4096120	4097120	I remember that.
4097120	4099120	I got a little drunk that show, too.
4099120	4100120	Oh, yeah, can we pass it through?
4100120	4104120	And afterwards, Bill went, yeah, you had a little too much Jesus juice.
4106120	4107120	That's what he said.
4107120	4110120	I call that a threshold guardian.
4110120	4111120	That's what Joseph Campbell would call it.
4111120	4114120	Wait, did you call him Joey Camps earlier?
4114120	4115120	Joey Camps.
4115120	4116120	Joey Camps.
4116120	4117120	Yeah, Joey Camps.
4117120	4118120	Yeah, Joey Camps.
4118120	4119120	Yeah.
4119120	4120120	Changed my life, Joey Camps.
4120120	4121120	That's what we had to chat about.
4121120	4122120	I prefer my Pete Holmes.
4122120	4123120	I don't think you talk too much at all.
4123120	4125120	I think you talk just enough.
4125120	4126120	That's very sweet.
4126120	4127120	And when I do Doug Love's movies,
4127120	4130120	kind of like what you were actually asking me about crashing, I think,
4130120	4134120	there is a depersonalizing element of you become like,
4134120	4137120	that's TV me and this is me me.
4137120	4140120	Similarly on Doug Love's movies, that's Doug Love's movies me.
4140120	4142120	We all have these different modes.
4142120	4145120	There's like Thanksgiving you, there's alone on the subway you,
4145120	4147120	there's drunk at a party you.
4147120	4148120	In fact, maybe you'll relate to this.
4148120	4151120	One of the reasons I don't like going to parties and getting stoned or whatever
4151120	4155120	is because I'm not that crazy about my personality.
4155120	4156120	Like, I love it.
4156120	4157120	Don't get me wrong.
4157120	4159120	But I'll also come home and I'll be like,
4159120	4161120	I told too many stories.
4162120	4165120	Or maybe that you joke about who you are, right?
4165120	4169120	I'll just say to Val, it's like, this is why I like to keep it at home.
4169120	4170120	Yeah.
4170120	4173120	Dan and I, we've been doing this podcast for four million episodes
4173120	4176120	and we've told the same seven stories a hundred thousand times.
4176120	4177120	For sure, yeah.
4177120	4179120	Yeah, well that's why, you know, good entertainer.
4179120	4181120	Like, it's good to know when to...
4181120	4182120	But bad at a party.
4182120	4183120	No, but we don't.
4183120	4185120	You would have thought we would have learned that a long time ago.
4185120	4187120	I keep telling the same five stories.
4187120	4189120	No, we always forget right when we should.
4189120	4192120	Right when we're about to repeat the first story, we forget.
4192120	4193120	No, I understand that.
4193120	4196120	I sometimes worry on my podcast because we've done, I don't know,
4196120	4198120	almost 400 episodes.
4198120	4199120	There's... Anyone listen?
4199120	4201120	I mean, you could give me...
4201120	4203120	You could give me feedback.
4203120	4205120	I won't take it personally.
4205120	4209120	Do you go like, he's going to tell that...
4209120	4211120	He's about to do that story, right?
4211120	4213120	I mean, I do too.
4213120	4215120	I'm also there and I'm like, wow.
4215120	4218120	It's like, AI could make me from the podcast.
4218120	4219120	You know what I mean?
4219120	4221120	If you say this, he's going to say that.
4221120	4225120	This is... Let's talk about that.
4225120	4226120	That's what I'm hearing.
4226120	4228120	That's what you just said about the party thing.
4228120	4231120	Like, go to... Like, why would I go to a party?
4231120	4236120	And then you sit there and like, who are you?
4236120	4237120	Like, just...
4237120	4238120	Which you?
4238120	4241120	Do you constantly wonder that?
4241120	4245120	And do quote-unquote normal people constantly wonder that?
4245120	4250120	I keep playing a Hail Mary where I think I'm pretty sure
4250120	4256120	quote-unquote normal people, AKA the people listening.
4256120	4257120	Although don't be so sure.
4257120	4260120	I used to be exclusionary in my language and I was like,
4260120	4262120	comedians are like this or creative people are like this.
4262120	4266120	Now, I'm sure most of these people here can relate to this feeling.
4266120	4269120	I just said that and you're high-roading me.
4270120	4273120	I made that exception.
4273120	4274120	Did you?
4274120	4275120	Yeah, I did.
4275120	4278120	Like, I'm saying, I think that...
4278120	4281120	I'm here and I'm listening.
4281120	4284120	Well, I'm unclear.
4284120	4287120	Deal with it.
4287120	4289120	That's the point of the show.
4289120	4290120	I'm unclear.
4290120	4291120	I'm unclear.
4291120	4293120	That is beautiful.
4293120	4295120	You can be unclear.
4295120	4296120	It's not beautiful.
4296120	4298120	Fuck you.
4298120	4300120	Fuck no.
4300120	4301120	No.
4301120	4305120	God damn your UCB training.
4305120	4309120	No, but that was what I was trying to express.
4309120	4310120	Yes, I understand.
4310120	4313120	Is that like, oh, God damn it.
4313120	4317120	Now I keep hearing your impression of me and I'm afraid to start.
4317120	4321120	But, oh, God damn it.
4321120	4324120	Do most people wonder who they are?
4325120	4330120	Does everyone basically essentially not know who they are?
4330120	4332120	I don't think so.
4332120	4334120	No, they don't or yes, they know they don't.
4334120	4336120	I wonder.
4336120	4341120	I have some friends where I'm just like, no, that guy's just fucking like, I'm Ted.
4341120	4343120	And he knows, and he knows.
4343120	4345120	And we love Ted.
4345120	4350120	Ted dies in a skiing accident and then everyone's like, there are good Ted's and bad Ted's.
4350120	4352120	Ted Bundy and then Ted.
4352120	4354120	The stuffed animal.
4354120	4356120	A good Ted.
4356120	4359120	Sometimes it's like, oh, that's why Ted shot that kid.
4359120	4362120	Well, it just feels like they just kind of switch automatically.
4362120	4364120	Where if we got to go, wait a second.
4364120	4366120	I'm going into a mall.
4366120	4368120	Okay, mall.
4368120	4369120	Got it.
4369120	4370120	It's very basic.
4370120	4371120	Other people just do it.
4371120	4373120	They're like, yeah, I'm Ted.
4373120	4374120	Here we go.
4374120	4375120	Ted and the mall.
4375120	4381120	I love that every once in a while sleepy Martin Starr chimes in.
4381120	4383120	That's very flattered.
4383120	4385120	That's one of the best.
4385120	4387120	It means how much weight you've lost.
4387120	4388120	Oh, man.
4388120	4389120	Yeah, you look great.
4389120	4396120	I would say like homeless fat guy from Game of Thrones or homeless fat guy from Lost.
4396120	4400120	I mean, Martin Starr, Jesus Christ, that's a handsome man.
4400120	4402120	That's a thin man.
4402120	4404120	He's actually here.
4404120	4408120	Spencer, so you're saying I think we can probably all relate to that.
4408120	4412120	Like if you're going, okay, I'm going into a Fourth of July party.
4412120	4414120	I got to be Fourth of July party, Spencer.
4414120	4420120	Well, that's what I thought he was mentioning is that it's like, oh, yeah, we're different people in different situations.
4420120	4423120	You know, we kind of we act differently depending on who are around.
4423120	4427120	And isn't Dan saying, though, underneath that we're going, but who am I really?
4427120	4428120	Right.
4428120	4430120	Yeah, I don't think Ted is going, but who's Ted?
4431120	4432120	Yes.
4432120	4433120	Yeah.
4433120	4438120	There are some people who are like, well, I'm sure I'm Ted.
4438120	4439120	I know these people.
4439120	4441120	We all do.
4441120	4445120	Around this time we hear these people are going, we wish you a Merry Christmas.
4445120	4446120	We wish you a Merry Christmas.
4446120	4448120	And they're just like, they're just the end.
4448120	4450120	They don't they don't think how does this look?
4450120	4452120	They're just like, I'll bring us the picky board.
4452120	4457120	But but but but but some of the people doing that are us.
4457120	4458120	Yeah.
4458120	4459120	Yeah.
4459120	4460120	And they're going, oh, it's true.
4460120	4461120	America.
4461120	4462120	And they're like, fuck it.
4462120	4463120	I would love.
4463120	4464120	Ted would like me.
4464120	4465120	Yes.
4465120	4466120	That's what complicated.
4466120	4468120	I think like I think I can double down.
4468120	4469120	I don't know.
4469120	4471120	I actually know Ted's are like a calming influence.
4471120	4472120	Right.
4472120	4473120	No, I can then I don't I don't know.
4473120	4474120	I actually prefer.
4474120	4476120	They're like, just be a little bit racist.
4476120	4478120	I think I think it helps.
4478120	4481120	I think everything it keeps the braces out.
4481120	4483120	It helps on the road.
4483120	4485120	Who do you keep an extra eye on?
4485120	4488120	It keeps too many races from happening.
4488120	4490120	If you're a little bit racist.
4490120	4491120	Oh, my God.
4491120	4494120	There are probably people that are like being racist keeps too
4494120	4496120	many races from happening.
4496120	4497120	What are you going to do?
4497120	4499120	Be all these super race racer.
4499120	4503120	Because if like a seven times removed like this person as a
4503120	4505120	yep, I it's weird.
4505120	4509120	All I know is I wake up on a bed.
4509120	4511120	I don't want it to change.
4511120	4513120	Then I go to work.
4513120	4518120	If anyone tries to change my bed, fuck them.
4518120	4520120	Like, yeah, it's like they're like right.
4520120	4524120	We call them ribosomes in biological.
4524120	4525120	Yeah.
4525120	4527120	They're like they maintain like they read the DNA.
4527120	4528120	I actually think that's brilliant.
4528120	4532120	I often think of people in terms of cells because we're all just
4532120	4534120	kind of doing what cells do anyway.
4534120	4536120	Like I'm just like one of those loud cells.
4536120	4539120	It's like floating around just going like, can I bond with you?
4539120	4540120	Yeah.
4540120	4544120	And don't you think I don't you think on a playground without a
4544120	4545120	Ted?
4545120	4546120	Yeah.
4546120	4547120	You'd be cancer.
4547120	4548120	Yes.
4548120	4549120	Yeah.
4549120	4550120	I need a Ted.
4550120	4551120	And then I become a nose.
4551120	4553120	Because we would, we would show up to the playground and be like,
4553120	4555120	whatever you say.
4555120	4556120	Yeah.
4556120	4557120	That's right.
4557120	4560120	I've got an HBO show now at the president.
4560120	4563120	Like we wouldn't know when to stop, but yeah, heads go like,
4563120	4565120	what's with your shoes?
4565120	4567120	I heard those shoes aren't right.
4567120	4568120	Yeah.
4568120	4570120	And we're like, fucking Ted's.
4570120	4572120	Some Ted's are like the white blood cells.
4572120	4573120	I just fucking regulate.
4573120	4574120	I don't know what they are.
4574120	4579120	Ted's are like, we got a nose to make.
4579120	4580120	Ted's got to wake up.
4580120	4581120	Make that bed.
4581120	4582120	Ted's are mitigators.
4582120	4583120	Yeah.
4583120	4584120	Some Ted's.
4584120	4589120	Like, like Joey Kams says that mythology has a dual function.
4589120	4594120	One part of it is to teach kids to dream bigger.
4594120	4597120	And one part is to dream smaller.
4597120	4602120	It's like taking adolescence, natural anger,
4602120	4606120	their natural desire to eat the fathers of the tribe
4606120	4608120	and to direct it outward.
4608120	4609120	Yeah.
4609120	4612120	Which you do with like Star Wars movies and you go, whoa, what?
4612120	4613120	Hey, what?
4613120	4614120	You turn in 13.
4614120	4617120	You thinking that maybe if you cut my head off,
4617120	4620120	you could be in charge of everything.
4620120	4621120	What a crazy feeling.
4621120	4622120	Yeah.
4622120	4623120	Luke Skywalker felt like that.
4623120	4627120	But then he learned that Darth Vader lives in a spaceship.
4627120	4629120	Uh, help me make these weapons.
4629120	4630120	Yeah.
4630120	4633120	That that's a big part of mythology at a tribal level
4633120	4636120	is like directing anger outward, like getting,
4636120	4638120	get this radiation out of the power plant.
4638120	4639120	Yeah.
4639120	4640120	So it doesn't melt down.
4640120	4641120	And then the,
4641120	4645120	but then the other totally contradictory part is you're trying to
4645120	4647120	actually make people proud of themselves.
4647120	4652120	You're trying to tell people don't let the shielding around this nuclear
4652120	4654120	power plant close us in.
4654120	4659120	And, and so you're encouraging radiation while trying to figure out how
4659120	4661120	to funnel it out into the world.
4661120	4663120	A healthy steam release.
4663120	4664120	You know, I'll tell you something beautiful.
4664120	4666120	I, this whole time I was trying to remember who said it,
4666120	4668120	but unfortunately I can't remember his name,
4668120	4670120	but it's a Joseph Campbell scholar who was talking about,
4670120	4672120	there's all these like teen suicides.
4672120	4673120	And he's like,
4673120	4677120	what people need to realize is instead of like walking on a bridge and
4677120	4678120	jumping off,
4678120	4682120	they need to realize what part of them needs to die that they might
4682120	4683120	continue to the other side.
4683120	4684120	Well, the whole thing.
4684120	4685120	Otherwise they wouldn't.
4685120	4688120	Well, that's, that's what a suit,
4688120	4694120	but mythology addresses youth angst and rage and anger and saying,
4694120	4696120	yeah, fucking a, you're right.
4696120	4701120	Part of you is going to die and part of you is going to be killed by you.
4701120	4702120	That's what all young.
4702120	4703120	Yeah.
4703120	4705120	Like when there's another part of you that goes forward and that's,
4705120	4707120	that's sometimes missing,
4707120	4710120	especially from American stories that sometimes we're missing that second
4710120	4711120	part.
4711120	4715120	Yeah. If you create a societal mechanism that says to kids,
4715120	4717120	you're either going to be a doctor,
4717120	4719120	a lawyer or a thief,
4719120	4721120	and they don't want to be any of the three,
4721120	4722120	they're going to,
4722120	4725120	you're going to have a higher suicide rate than if you say to a kid,
4725120	4730120	here are some things that people have been doctors and lawyers and thieves.
4730120	4731120	However,
4731120	4732120	Yeah.
4732120	4733120	Also.
4733120	4734120	You could be a wizard.
4735120	4737120	And part of you could be a wizard.
4737120	4738120	Yeah.
4738120	4739120	I'm not even joking.
4739120	4744120	Be a fucking knight or a wizard or a Skywalker or a Neo.
4744120	4745120	All right.
4745120	4750120	Are you guys getting these references?
4750120	4751120	Can you choose to be a Neo though?
4751120	4754120	Doesn't Neo kind of get thrust upon you?
4754120	4756120	Was Neo really the one?
4756120	4759120	Google it.
4759120	4760120	What is that?
4760120	4761120	I always see,
4761120	4763120	I always see that headline and never click on it.
4763120	4765120	Like the Reddit thing where I like have someone explain.
4765120	4766120	Yeah.
4766120	4767120	I'm always like,
4767120	4771120	why I totally accept that maybe he isn't,
4771120	4772120	but who can?
4772120	4773120	Well,
4773120	4776120	you see there was a second layer to the matrix that's designed for you to
4776120	4780120	think you've escaped from the matrix and think that you're the one and save in
4780120	4781120	the day.
4781120	4784120	But that's just part of the matrix.
4784120	4785120	Wait, no,
4785120	4786120	is that in the matrix though?
4786120	4790120	Because there's so many more matrix theories that are more interesting than
4790120	4791120	the matrix.
4791120	4792120	Right.
4792120	4794120	And that sounds like one of those.
4794120	4795120	Well,
4795120	4796120	well,
4796120	4799120	he uses powers presumably once when he's technically out of the matrix and
4799120	4800120	people are like,
4800120	4801120	well,
4801120	4802120	how could that is?
4802120	4803120	Yeah.
4803120	4804120	People are like,
4804120	4805120	well,
4805120	4806120	how could that happen unless they're in the matrix and then that conspiracy
4806120	4807120	theory?
4807120	4808120	Yeah.
4808120	4809120	I think that's where that whole concept comes from.
4809120	4810120	But they never answered that question.
4810120	4812120	The second movie ends with why does he have powers in the,
4812120	4813120	in the real world?
4813120	4815120	And then the third one went,
4815120	4816120	he just does.
4816120	4817120	Right.
4817120	4819120	And that is the most disappointing.
4819120	4820120	I wrote my,
4820120	4821120	I don't write fan fiction,
4821120	4822120	but I had this,
4822120	4825120	I had this whole ending.
4825120	4826120	What was that?
4826120	4827120	I was laughing.
4827120	4830120	I don't like fan fiction.
4830120	4831120	What was that?
4831120	4835120	I was enjoying the idea of a different me that writes fan fiction.
4835120	4840120	Like there's a simpler life by candlelight.
4840120	4842120	But I have this whole thing where like I wanted,
4842120	4845120	I wanted Neo to be fighting agent Smith,
4845120	4847120	who they say is actually the one.
4847120	4848120	Right.
4848120	4850120	To unplug himself.
4850120	4852120	Like that's enlightenment agent Smith.
4852120	4853120	No, no,
4853120	4858120	I wanted Neo to be in this inescapable position where he needs to save
4858120	4859120	Trinity or whoever,
4859120	4861120	but he's blocked in and he can't get out.
4861120	4865120	So he realizes that he's just in a simulation and Neo in the real world
4865120	4867120	unplugs himself,
4867120	4868120	plugs himself back in,
4868120	4870120	in a new place and saves the day.
4870120	4872120	That seemed like a good model of enlightenment.
4872120	4873120	They're always just like in the,
4873120	4876120	are you saying in the first movie and the third movie?
4876120	4877120	Oh,
4877120	4878120	the third movie.
4878120	4879120	Well, that's what I'm saying.
4879120	4880120	I'm trying to fix it.
4880120	4881120	Well, yeah, I know.
4881120	4882120	Yeah, I'm trying.
4882120	4885120	I'm saying like you're fixing a fucking duck hunt that went from the
4885120	4887120	marsh to the parking lot of a,
4887120	4888120	I'm like,
4888120	4891120	I watched all three of them and I was like on the third one.
4891120	4892120	I'm like,
4892120	4893120	what the fuck?
4893120	4894120	What?
4894120	4895120	Yeah.
4895120	4896120	That's why the Pete Holmes fan fiction version.
4896120	4897120	Yeah.
4897120	4898120	No.
4898120	4899120	And when he comes back,
4899120	4900120	he's in white.
4900120	4901120	Why do people think that?
4901120	4902120	I honestly like,
4902120	4903120	I remember like he goes like.
4903120	4904120	Awesome.
4904120	4906120	Why do people think agent Smith is actually the one?
4906120	4909120	Because he's the one that gets the matrix shut down.
4909120	4911120	Well, because the real ending was so bad.
4911120	4912120	They were like, well,
4912120	4913120	this can't be what it was.
4913120	4915120	We have to have been missing something.
4915120	4917120	What if agent Smith is the one?
4917120	4919120	Then it's great.
4919120	4920120	Yeah.
4920120	4921120	That's where all this stuff comes from.
4921120	4922120	It's like,
4922120	4925120	truly it all grows out of the ending being unsatisfying.
4925120	4927120	I say this with a lot of love.
4927120	4931120	It feels like some pastor is trying to like breathe life into the Old Testament.
4931120	4932120	They're like,
4932120	4933120	it is cool.
4933120	4934120	You guys.
4934120	4935120	Yeah.
4935120	4938120	It, it reminds me of not to get political,
4938120	4939120	but the smocking.
4939120	4940120	Oh boy.
4940120	4943120	My favorite smocking tweet of the,
4943120	4944120	I'm not on Twitter.
4944120	4946120	And so when I hear about something,
4946120	4949120	it means that it was fucking radioactive.
4949120	4950120	Like I'm like, did,
4950120	4953120	did the president say smocking?
4953120	4956120	And it radiated out to me.
4956120	4957120	And then I was like,
4957120	4958120	I'm not on Twitter.
4958120	4959120	I'm going to go on Twitter.
4959120	4960120	Cause I want to find,
4960120	4965120	I want to find the guy with the most followers who tried to make hay out of
4965120	4966120	this sunshine.
4966120	4969120	Uh, and I, that guy who was like,
4969120	4971120	Hey, uh,
4971120	4974120	he's mocking you for believing in, uh,
4974120	4976120	needing a smoking gun.
4976120	4977120	Like hello.
4977120	4978120	Oh, I see.
4978120	4979120	I love that.
4979120	4980120	That is creative thinking.
4980120	4983120	But yeah, like the mythology creating like you,
4983120	4985120	it's a, it's the human storytelling.
4985120	4987120	It's apologetics.
4987120	4988120	Yeah.
4988120	4989120	Yeah. No, it is apologetics.
4989120	4990120	Thank you Martin.
4991120	4992120	Thank you.
4994120	4995120	Hello Democrats.
4995120	4997120	He's smocking you.
4998120	5000120	The joke's on you.
5000120	5005120	It's, it's not a story about a targeted AI voting systems combined with
5005120	5008120	smartphones resulting in a half literate president.
5010120	5012120	That's not what this is about.
5013120	5015120	He's smocking you.
5016120	5018120	It's all a code.
5018120	5019120	I like that.
5019120	5020120	I like it when people are like,
5020120	5023120	I genuinely non-ironically like it when people are like so into something
5023120	5024120	that they're like,
5024120	5026120	what was that person being ironic or being?
5026120	5027120	No, no.
5027120	5028120	Well, I mean, they're,
5028120	5029120	it's apologetics.
5029120	5030120	They're lying.
5030120	5032120	They're there to themselves and to people.
5032120	5033120	They weren't doing a bit.
5033120	5035120	They were, they were being sincere in their own.
5035120	5038120	They'll say that they were doing a bit in their memoirs for years from now.
5038120	5039120	Phantom Menace.
5039120	5040120	Right.
5040120	5041120	I'm not even joking.
5041120	5043120	I'm sure some of you found a way.
5043120	5045120	Star Wars matters enough to you.
5045120	5046120	Right. Right. Right.
5046120	5047120	That you're like,
5047120	5048120	you need to see it a few times.
5048120	5049120	Like I didn't like the Last Jedi.
5049120	5051120	And most people that did were like,
5051120	5052120	you need to see it twice.
5052120	5053120	And I was like,
5053120	5055120	I'm not that all in.
5056120	5057120	It's like,
5057120	5058120	I'm a one,
5058120	5059120	you get one try,
5059120	5060120	Mr. Lucas.
5061120	5062120	I got,
5062120	5064120	I got fired from community,
5064120	5065120	uh,
5065120	5066120	uh,
5066120	5067120	season four.
5067120	5068120	And then I,
5068120	5069120	I,
5069120	5071120	the last time I ever Googled myself was like,
5071120	5075120	I can't wait to see how these people,
5075120	5076120	like,
5076120	5077120	they are going to miss me.
5077120	5079120	And I like Googled my name,
5079120	5081120	like Dan Harmon season four community.
5081120	5082120	And it was like,
5082120	5084120	community just got better.
5086120	5087120	Essentially.
5087120	5088120	But it was worse than that,
5088120	5089120	actually,
5089120	5091120	because that would be such an inversion that I would be like,
5091120	5092120	oh,
5092120	5093120	I'm Jonathan Swift and you're all the luputions.
5093120	5094120	It was like,
5094120	5095120	not that satisfying.
5095120	5097120	It was more relativistic.
5097120	5098120	It was like,
5098120	5101120	welcome to the fact that everything you ever held valuable was a lie.
5101120	5102120	Because it was like,
5102120	5103120	Oh,
5103120	5107120	I'm fishing for this Marlin and what you catch isn't the opposite of a Marlin.
5107120	5109120	What you catch is a Marlin boot.
5109120	5110120	Like you catch,
5110120	5112120	it was just like people going like,
5112120	5113120	Hey,
5113120	5114120	let's give it a chance.
5114120	5116120	At least that fucking piece of shit is gone.
5116120	5118120	Wow.
5118120	5119120	And maybe,
5119120	5120120	maybe this season sucks,
5120120	5122120	but doesn't all TV suck?
5122120	5125120	And was season three even that good?
5126120	5127120	And I was like,
5127120	5129120	it was the truth that I didn't want.
5129120	5130120	It burnt.
5130120	5133120	It's like harder than any holy water.
5133120	5134120	And you go like,
5134120	5135120	fuck that burns.
5135120	5136120	It hurts.
5136120	5137120	Holy water shouldn't be burning.
5137120	5138120	You know,
5138120	5139120	it shouldn't be burning you.
5139120	5140120	That's a bad sign.
5140120	5141120	Just water.
5141120	5142120	It means you should.
5142120	5143120	It's you.
5143120	5144120	I mean,
5144120	5145120	you're,
5145120	5146120	that's your privilege.
5146120	5148120	You can call it just regular water,
5148120	5149120	but it burns me.
5149120	5152120	So I have a microaggression for you.
5152120	5155120	I have a non-devil privilege.
5155120	5159120	Check your non-devil privilege, man.
5159120	5162120	What, what, what, what, what hurts you?
5162120	5163120	Like, like, like.
5165120	5167120	Here's our new segment in Harman,
5167120	5169120	what hurts Pete Holmes?
5169120	5171120	Are you, are you happy Pete Holmes?
5171120	5173120	Are you coping with happiness or are you,
5173120	5176120	are you living in terror of.
5176120	5179120	Shut your fucking phone off.
5179120	5181120	Are you living in terror of like,
5181120	5184120	are you, are you addicted to worrying?
5184120	5188120	Are you just happy?
5188120	5191120	I go through peaks and valleys just like everybody.
5191120	5194120	I would say I'm content that I can find,
5194120	5196120	I'm happy to report that I can find a way.
5196120	5200120	I found a way that even when I am depressed,
5200120	5203120	there's a part of me that can sort of embrace
5203120	5206120	the snowed in cozy quality of a sad period.
5206120	5207120	If that makes sense.
5207120	5209120	Can we try like a simulation?
5209120	5211120	I'm going to try to see.
5211120	5212120	Okay.

5322080	5325020	We just want to start to get on the same page and talk to you about some thoughts.
5325020	5331320	just say so the character of Pete like I don't want to talk I never talked about
5331320	5335960	anything I never say anything I just go with whatever you want I was having
5335960	5343160	lunch with somebody yesterday and they said I said I love I love crashing it's
5343160	5353900	like someone put the alphabet in a house are you ready to do season four of
5353900	5358580	crash are you gonna tell me it's not happening and then I don't God if they
5358580	5363920	would ever tell you that sorry can I cut it this is Toby Tom nom just died in a
5363920	5376340	car crash oh we liked him Tom no okay well Pete sounds like Tom nom died no no
5376340	5381500	I can't even remember what I was there was a thing there was a thing behind my
5381500	5390860	bed that was like I want I wanted to actually like I wanted to Tom is dead
5390860	5396740	you guys I can't remember what my actual thing well him dying makes me sad yet
5396740	5401360	there's a part of me that is appreciating just what it's like to
5401360	5406460	sometimes be sad yeah oh well no I think it was just like a sort of like I know
5406460	5413500	this is exaggeration but it's like listen Pete well HBO we fell back into
5413500	5420540	the bit yeah like I well I remember what my point Tom's numb Tom numbers body is
5420540	5425340	still warm you guys Pete we love Pete are you there
5425340	5432740	Pete it's me Marsha I own everything are you there I'm breaking up
5433740	5442220	all right but but but but my question is like what if they is there's something
5442220	5445280	because we're talking about happiness I'm saying could anything rattle you
5445280	5451160	could anything make you upset oh yeah I get rattled for sure well then what then
5451160	5458720	what do you do um I mean it sounds glib but I really do try to enjoy everything
5458720	5462720	sometimes I'll say to Valerie like I'm just being angry for fun like I'll like
5462720	5467780	I want to let her know that I haven't like lost control or something but it's
5467780	5472660	fun to like rant or talk about he didn't get what you wanted or how sad you are
5472660	5477420	how hurt you are what somebody owed you you know all this is like fucking drama
5477420	5482100	playing a character yeah it is and it sounds a little glib but I do try to look
5482100	5487800	at it like a character I'm like look at fucking Pete doing his Pete thing I wonder
5487800	5491340	if Pete will ever get out of this Joseph Campbell talks about that he talks
5491340	5495900	about like the idea of having one foot in and one foot out well that's that's a
5495900	5500460	it is a very spiritual idea meaning it shows up in all of the myths like your
5500460	5504720	rodeo clown you're like like oh look at me like like yeah I think everybody you
5504720	5508000	know some of this is in addressed in my special dirty clean which airs this
5508000	5515520	Saturday but I thank you I do think we all relate to the idea of like kind of
5515520	5521160	being behind our eyeballs like being consciousness and we know that but then
5521160	5525020	this consciousness is sort of stuck in this in these molecules stuck in the
5525020	5528980	shape of a human body and everybody's always looking at you and going like hey
5528980	5536100	there's a man and you go like man and and you sort of like you know this is an
5536100	5539700	Alan Watts line he's like you're behind your eyeballs and the rest just dangles
5539700	5544780	sort of dangles down here and like this is a Pete Holmes line and you go like I
5544780	5549900	want that diet coke send the arm and you like send I'm gonna give it to us and
5549900	5557160	you drink it so you are it's not really that wu wu or strange to say you are
5557160	5562240	consciousness I don't think that is a deeply religious idea you ever do you
5562240	5565000	ever have these moods and they never last more than 30 seconds leave but do
5565000	5571280	you ever honestly like you're walking around you go like what if what if I was
5571280	5581340	God what if what if let me finish what if everyone else was also God yeah you
5581340	5585060	know like like and then do you ever like how long are you able to like keep that
5585060	5589540	crunch going where you like the UPS guy and you're like hello and you're like
5589540	5596820	like wink wink I get it we're both God that damn that's enlightenment do you
5596820	5601160	ever maintain that for more than 15 seconds I UPS guys bringing some
5601160	5603860	piece of shit and you're like this isn't what I ordered no I do it in
5603860	5608360	bursts I want a guy on the 10 today cut me off and he did it in such a dick way
5608360	5612020	and you're like driving a blue Honda right but that's what I did I was what
5612020	5615300	else would God drive yeah he's driving his blue Honda and his windows are down
5615300	5619660	and he really almost hit me as he as he and it was unnecessary and he's got in
5619660	5623860	front of me and I didn't honk cuz I'm like I'm trying to build a narrative one
5623860	5628340	of my one of my favorite quotes is hate is a lack of imagination so I want to
5628340	5634040	hate this guy it's actually I think it's like a proverb from a people it's
5634040	5637360	not like a person that's fucking amazing give it a Google is a lack of
5637360	5641920	imagination beautiful you haven't bothered to think yet about how to not
5641920	5645280	that's right be pissed I would I've added to it I think hell is a lack of
5645280	5649440	imagination that's that's also that's my little addition to it so this guy so I'm
5649440	5653900	trying really hard to go that's gone imaginative he's just playing his part
5653900	5658760	free will is an illusion we're all just operating in the system of synapse and
5658760	5662180	we're just it's just there the whole all of this is just one thing thinking
5662180	5666280	itself and there's that thing there's that part and now I'm interacting with
5666280	5671020	it and how I react is my choice or the illusion of my choice it's up to you so
5671020	5678380	I didn't react but then someone did exactly to him what he just did to me
5678380	5683720	like cut him off in the exact same way to him or you to him so someone's cutting
5683720	5689840	off blue car God and Pete God is watching blue car God and that person
5689840	5692480	I'm actually watching and they're not doing it super aggressively they seem to
5692480	5698040	be doing it more out of need blue car God honks actually speeds up trying to
5698040	5702840	make a collision it looks like and then get changes lanes with his windows down
5702840	5706720	and is honking at the person trying to get their attention to yell at them
5706720	5711320	like fuck you fuck you fuck you and and now I'm trying to box them in because I
5711320	5719160	don't like blue car God anymore that's all outrage where I just was a good
5719160	5723440	person you're a shitty person the grace that I showed him he didn't have for
5723440	5729880	someone who just did what he did right but I mean what are we gonna do some
5729880	5736720	gods are assholes well that's right like like the actual like zen spot you have to
5736720	5741240	not only it's not about like it's not like stacking sandbags those will be
5741240	5745760	overcome by the flood you have to actually arrive at a version of this
5745760	5750240	that is proofed against infinity I actually think it's simpler than that
5750240	5756760	the brain wants a click moment late like Lego pieces of rationale my ego wants a
5756760	5760720	story that goes well he's probably late to something and therefore it's
5760720	5766000	justifiable in this like 2018 American driving etiquette but you have to
5766000	5770840	empathize then no no no you don't have to do any of that in fact the answer is
5770840	5774760	way beyond your reason and it's beyond your rat it's trans you just accept
5774760	5778240	you're like it's not my job it's not even to think even that's a thought it's
5778240	5781320	trans rational which is one of my favorite words in the world it doesn't
5781320	5787040	gross yeah it's not rational at all it doesn't require any effort one of the
5787040	5790040	reasons why people aren't more loving is because it takes all this effort like
5790040	5795080	rational be loving but you can actually opt out of the whole game and just go
5795080	5800000	like it doesn't matter yeah my favorite you talked about Zen my favorite Zen
5800000	5804800	thing is what in this moment is lacking yeah so I'm telling myself this story
5804800	5808840	about what's fair and what's unfair and who's an asshole and how he should have
5808840	5812120	learned by how I was nice to him he should be nice to somebody else when
5812120	5816180	really all of that's over it's just become a story that my brain is telling
5816180	5820900	me that's causing me suffering what if I can just do nothing not think but
5820900	5826180	surrender and just go and yet here we are nothing's wrong in this moment
5826180	5830100	nothing's wrong your brain is just telling you stories that create your
5830100	5834740	self what do you think it is about us that makes us then because that seems so
5834740	5841980	perfectly logical and it would make us all live longer right why are we we're
5841980	5846380	addicted to it why it's pleasant because the individual primate well I
5846380	5852220	think it's more dopamine from alarm in the immediate sense right I don't I
5852220	5856580	that's an interesting idea is that you get rewarded as a monkey for going was
5856580	5863500	the ha there's something wrong it's the highs and lows the this is Ram Dass he
5863500	5867020	talks about the dark night of the soul is really when you realize that you're
5867020	5871700	gonna lose the highs and the lows of being a part of the human drama yeah
5872540	5879500	she said she said so you may I'm like look I I had a major corporation accused
5879500	5884420	me of pedophilia they investigated me I I'm like I'm done like I've gone through
5884420	5888300	all of these things I quit my Twitter account but for the last year I've gone
5888300	5892140	through all these things and I arrived the story with her and she goes so
5892140	5899820	you're happy now and I go yeah and she's like what what which was sorry what's
5899820	5904620	that sound and she's like you're gonna walk around for the next five years and
5904620	5909660	she characterized it as this thing that I keep thinking of she goes when you get
5909660	5916540	up from a bar and you're you're like where's my phone where are my keys that
5916540	5921140	that's your relationship with comfort and happiness that the human the human
5921140	5927140	animal as a primate who survived this long all of our all of our DNA is what
5927140	5931540	the reason we're here no matter how chill we are we owe our fucking line
5931540	5936740	yeah no you're right to the amoeba that was like panicky that was like we should
5936740	5941620	change you're fucking a right good enough yet brother no you're
5941620	5948540	absolutely and dead men tell no tales so every fucking chill squirrel yeah gone
5948540	5954580	gone done and every fucking like thing that led to us it was like like
5954580	5961220	especially us lately and you is like yeah climb a branch cling tight scream
5961220	5966620	at the top of your lungs right there is a leopard coming right and if you scream
5966620	5973100	it loud enough at the right time you will get laid yeah and if you and if
5973100	5977420	you're wrong if you can convince someone a leopard was coming you'll still get
5977420	5982900	laid like like like that that we invented like no you're absolutely an
5982900	5987620	alarm because because of a beautiful thing about our species a beautiful
5987620	5992500	thing yeah which is we don't want no fucking trouble yeah we don't that like
5992500	5997220	that is but the one that could imagine trouble and then prepare for it the
5997220	6000940	problem is my therapist always says you know it's a bell curve you want to have
6000940	6007180	just enough he's like paranoid people are right that's what he says he's like
6007180	6010660	you're absolutely right to be paranoid you and this is his language I hope
6010660	6013740	you're not offended by it he goes you just don't want to be its bitch that's
6013740	6017140	what he says that's the difference he's like all of those things that you're
6017140	6020820	worried about could happen that one of the things about being human is learning
6020820	6027220	how to like reconcile with that reality and live concurrently you know the tough
6027220	6031780	thing is though is like like like so we we wake up every morning we turn on our
6031780	6036540	phones we have this app and the app says here's everything that happened to
6036540	6041500	every fucking human being across the planet which includes everybody so so
6041500	6046900	this is how many 19 year old black men got shot by police and they didn't
6046900	6049980	deserve it and all these things happen so you get this fire hose to the face
6049980	6057740	yeah and and so the toughest thing of all is you go what you go wait so I'm
6057740	6063340	supposed to do what and I'm supposed like and and you get bifurcated it every
6063340	6071500	instance like your your your ego which should come out of bed fully baked like
6071500	6075680	rising like a beautiful souffle I don't know anything about cooking this
6075680	6079820	metaphor is bad thanks to plays aren't for breakfast and that's not how it
6079820	6083020	worked I'm that you're just saying you should be you should have this kind of
6083020	6087500	like whole thing and then it's like you wake up in the morning and you pull out
6087500	6091940	your phone and your phone is so and I'm not saying it's a bad thing because we
6091940	6097260	don't want to your phone is now giving you this information that you didn't get
6097260	6103420	when you were a fucking regular ass primate yeah which is like somewhere
6103420	6110220	right now someone is they just found their children's bones under a dog house
6110220	6115580	and the and the Justice Department says they should go fuck themselves you you
6115580	6123340	have no like Prince Guatemala like like like like had to leave his palace like
6123340	6127460	like and go who's what's with that guy over there and then the people are like
6127460	6133060	he's got the flu and he's like well then I'm gonna be a religion like like well
6133060	6140020	get great like I guess hip-hop was easier back then too like but like every
6140020	6147060	thirteen-year-old now that can read the first thing they read is is is actual
6147060	6151900	misery is happening I don't know what I don't you know so Pete home so what are
6151900	6156100	you gonna do in season four of crash but it's it's you know your feed might be
6156100	6160060	misery but the truth is is we could also just be reading entertainment news we
6160060	6163780	could just be doing Sudoku we could just be reading fiction it doesn't have to be
6163780	6169140	I'm just saying no no I think what's going on is no we're drawn to it I
6169140	6172500	know and I don't mean to imply it's being forced upon us I know I didn't
6172500	6177060	think you were but misery is one of the avenues that you can choose and maybe you
6177060	6181440	know I it's good to know what's going on the world for sure I think what's been
6181440	6186000	perverted is our we're addicted to thinking we love thinking and we think
6186000	6189700	thinking about things is important and you're absolutely I think the brain is
6189700	6195340	taken over our being the human brain is a terminal like you the servants become
6195340	6198940	the master you get to choose like like basically we're all and it's an
6198940	6203180	addiction and it feels good knowing everything and we're all choosing an
6203180	6206860	individual level something that actually we should be proud of we should forgive
6206860	6212540	ourselves for which is that if if you if you pump all information about human
6212540	6218260	misery and pleasure into our brain we will overload shoes to focus on the
6218260	6223380	misery yeah and we will choose to figure out how to react to it the best way we
6223380	6228100	can as children which is we will swing our toy fire truck at it we'll be like
6228100	6232900	then fuck you that's right I hate badness and I want goodness I don't want
6232900	6237580	lucky charms I want golden grams right like we don't know what else to do we're
6237580	6242220	children as a species what species should be expected to deal with all that
6242220	6248020	information I agree I actually I would argue that it is certainly partly a bad
6248020	6254140	thing you know it's hard to talk about because I can't represent everybody in
6254140	6257300	the room and I know a lot of people would say that you need to know what's
6257300	6263060	going on I tend to opt out of as much of it as I can all I know is that opting out
6263060	6268820	has led toward my happiness but I'm not so naive as to think that that means
6268820	6274140	that everybody should opt out that's all I know right now is a 45 year old man
6274140	6281020	that I I was making myself and other people miserable yeah and that I deleted
6281020	6286180	my Twitter and my Facebook and that I got happier but I I absolutely keep in
6286180	6289820	mind the fact that this is not that that's not the third act of a story
6289820	6294660	about being being happy right it might be the first act of a story about taking
6294660	6298100	responsibility I don't know I but the point I'm trying to make because we all
6298100	6301620	will have social responsibility and we do want to know about young black men
6301620	6305460	being shot which was everybody come on we all want to know about it well we
6305460	6311940	need to know to keep people accountable it's the new Marmaduke I peed homes do
6311940	6320340	not endorse that joke but what I'm trying to say is take the misery addiction
6320340	6324700	out which it can be you're gonna replace most people are gonna replace it with
6324700	6329780	something else and what I'm arguing for which brings me a lot of contentment not
6329780	6333300	necessarily happiness but a lot of contentment a lot of equanimity is
6333300	6337700	practicing being and we're getting robbed of that whether it is from just
6337700	6341700	doing crosswords or reading entertainment news and not any of the
6341700	6346140	serious stuff or any fucking bullshit or watching mindless endless television
6346140	6350500	this is just feeding your ego feeding you with anxiety and stress because I
6350500	6353940	think we have an ego addiction as well we want to know who we are so we can
6353940	6357340	know oh I disagree with you is why racism is so popular this is why
6357340	6360580	transphobia is so popular with some my misogyny so popular because we're
6360580	6364340	feeding you're gonna you're gonna a faster path to finding out who you are
6364340	6369420	but not but not if there's articles that say like hey this transgender bathroom
6369420	6372940	fucking thing happened you're gonna click that faster than it's like here's
6372940	6376980	everything you've ever not wanted to know about blue whales like like yeah
6376980	6379980	there's like all this information that's what I'm saying you're gonna rush your
6379980	6384660	ego you're like I want to know who I am I want to know who I am it's it's it's
6384660	6389180	tribalism it's it's a lot it gives a good feeling of identity even the rage
6389180	6394100	you go well that's fucking bullshit your ego goes here I am but when I said
6394100	6398260	earlier it seems like we're so far away from it what in this moment is lacking
6398260	6404540	and I felt like we shared a nice moment of like here we are that's what's
6404540	6408580	missing from equanimity peace and contentment and joy and bliss and it has
6408580	6412220	very little to do with my fucking phone which I don't turn on until after
6412220	6418780	breakfast well done like I'm like like I'm having these crazy dreams lately
6418780	6423220	because I've been spending way more time on my screen than I ever have and it's
6423220	6426740	fucking me up like during the night and having like terrible like weird dreams
6426740	6430460	but like going on stage and doing comedy yeah you know what I call looking at
6430460	6438020	Instagram before I go to bed casting my dream fucking bullshit do you realize
6438020	6441300	how every primitive culture at what a value they put on your dreams and what a
6441300	6445020	glimpse into your subconscious and meaning they were and now I'm dreaming
6445020	6454380	about fucking an episode of 24 week can you imagine yeah I was thinking about
6454380	6459260	that today you gave one like primitive person a phone of course they'd look at
6459260	6464100	it it's not your friend I'm sorry I took over no that's it's not your friend it's
6464100	6467580	where I was why you're here but like like people like asked me like you get
6467580	6470260	nervous when you walk on stage it's like that's the least nervous I ever am
6470260	6475980	because that's the most present that's right I'm looking at her phones it's
6475980	6480860	fucking great yeah like it's like like being in a room full of people and like
6480860	6485980	getting the calling response of talking and laughter or the silence of thoughts
6485980	6490740	and stuff like that like that's that's the most pure thing of my day and then
6490740	6494420	you walk off stage and you went oh that's right where they say about it who
6494420	6498940	fucking cares who gives a stupid dude we've figured out we've all sort of woke
6498940	6502620	up about food at least a lot of us have that a lot of food is made by
6502620	6505660	corporations that don't care about you that just want to make you addicted to
6505660	6509340	food that seemed to be like be something right around supersize me we're like oh
6509340	6513380	they just want to make you want more of it so you just buy more of it it's just
6513380	6516540	capitalism right we're starting to figure out the same thing about your
6516540	6521260	phone that the colors on your phone trigger things in your brain that make
6521260	6525300	you like seriously addicted to it because those were colors that were
6526180	6532140	survival red doesn't belong in that way in fucking snapchat it's making
6532140	6535860	something happen in your brain that was designed to keep you alive and it's the
6535860	6540140	manipulation of that in the same way that MSG is addictive or sugar is
6540140	6543380	addictive these colors in there but there's a part of it like everything
6543380	6547580	that tastes good though there's a part of it that works really well I mean the
6547580	6553060	advent of smartphones and everyone being connected the dropping of shame veils the
6553060	6556540	idea that you could be in Iowa and talking to somebody someone in Wyoming
6556540	6563940	means that like trans people gay people yeah that's right that you nerds like
6563940	6569500	like who can propel Marvel empires to Empire status like everyone it can
6569500	6574740	suddenly just go like hey fuck fuck what the hundred and fifty jag offs at my
6574740	6581260	accounting company think I I live in the real world which is on my phone which is
6581260	6586340	the more real than this shithole which says that actually I think Robert Tony
6586340	6590180	Jr. is a great choice for Tony Stark and I fucking sign off on that and I upvote
6590180	6594100	it and they you feel vindicated it's Billy Elliot in your pocket and then it
6594100	6598820	has this horrible like downside which is like also across town in the basement
6598820	6605340	all the Nazis going like hey oh shit I'm not the only 38 year old virgin fuck
6605340	6611820	Jews swipe right like funds the hating Jews love hating Jews too and everyone
6611820	6616340	the shame barrier drops and you got a bunch of human brains going like I'm not
6616340	6623420	ashamed I love my voice I'm talking now right but but I I would argue you can do
6623420	6628140	all of that with your phone on grayscale though yes yes yes no I know that which
6628140	6632940	is an option it's very easy to do it's under accessibility and you can make it
6632940	6636580	a triple-click shortcut if you want to use your map or something that you think
6636580	6640020	requires color my phone's on I have a lot of Pete tips to get off your phone
6640020	6643900	I've been color is a huge one it does drain your battery a little go to Pete
6643900	6649180	tips go to Pete tips on that full color page explaining I'm nothing but a
6649180	6654260	supporter of Pete tips but I also look at myself at 45 I feel like the reason
6654260	6661260	I'm into Pete tips is not because I'm enlightened it's because I actually like
6661260	6667100	I feel beaten and like I'm like I feel like the onion knight in Game of Thrones
6667100	6673540	like I'm like I he cut my fingers off I'm cool like like like that and so I
6673540	6678340	want I feel pity for the average 19 year old out there it's like now these old
6678340	6683500	enlightened people telling me turn on grayscale yeah do that later do I did
6683500	6689220	that when I was 38 you know what I mean great but but you gotta be somebody
6689220	6695580	before you can be nobody yeah that's somebody we mean being part of the
6695580	6703540	Borg cube yeah exactly yeah like I'm not gonna raise my daughter to be fuck
6703540	6711460	that be like me from the beginning gonna playing fucking Sega CD 12 hours a day
6711460	6716700	that's all part of it it's not a flaw leaving the village to come back to the
6716700	6720360	village isn't a flaw that's what makes that's what gives life a pulse you have
6720360	6723860	to have that you have to have your fuck up period I'm grateful for it yeah I
6723860	6729180	don't know if I'm gonna I don't that's the biggest thing about me when I think
6729180	6733700	about having kids I'm like I don't know I because I wouldn't know when to let
6733700	6738340	the kids start touching a fucking black mirror how do you mean watching black
6738340	6744780	mirror I like when do you because I go out with friends and they're like they're
6744780	6752340	a good parents and bad parents none of my business like I like there's some
6752340	6757460	people they just go their kids sitting there and they're like I'll have the the
6757460	6766100	omelet and their kids like ha pepper pig pot and some of the parents go like
6766100	6771260	you're being a little piece of shit and you need to fucking like like chill out
6771260	6776060	cuz we're and I recognize that cuz I that's my upbringing right like like I
6776060	6780900	have always anxiety cuz my mom would be like you don't talk like that and target
6780900	6788540	and like in this new store target it makes me well-behaved but does it make
6788540	6793820	me a misogynist does it who knows like and then these like you can hand the
6793820	6799700	kid a fucking black tablet and go like watch your fucking pepper pig and then I
6799700	6803900	watch parents go like like the kids like two years old with their grubby
6803900	6810680	greasy disgusting little fucking crayon fingers they go like they the their
6810680	6815900	brains aren't formed it's an abomination to me like I watch with my other eye I
6815900	6822980	go like you should totally have kids I'm sorry I I'm enjoying this conversation
