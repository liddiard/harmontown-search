70000	75000	Somebody said, somebody told me that I was supposed to say welcome the mayor of Harmontown,
75000	80000	Davis says make, mayor of Harmontown first.
80000	88000	Just bring out Spencer, the dungeon master guy.
88000	97000	Spencer's gonna, Spencer's gonna sit in front of the table for absolutely no reason.
97000	103000	Well what if I have to, you know.
103000	107000	You, you needed another bottle and you could do the shell game.
107000	108000	There you go.
108000	112000	I mean what, you know, what makes sense about Paul Shafer's relationship with, you know,
112000	117000	like why is he in the band but he taught, you know, it's like these things evolve organically.
117000	122000	One of these days I'm gonna flip this table and everyone will get it.
122000	125000	And you'll be wearing pants.
125000	126000	That'd be great.
126000	128000	I'm just wearing like black slacks.
128000	129000	Yeah.
129000	133000	If you walked out in shorts but then flipped the table and you're wearing pants.
133000	134000	And then I start tap dancing.
134000	136000	Hey, what'd you do this weekend Spencer?
136000	142000	Oh boy, let me tell you, I was at South by Southwest promoting Harmont West on CISO.
142000	146000	That's crazy.
146000	152000	So it's SW times SW.
152000	155000	Well no, it's S times SW.
155000	156000	Right.
156000	157000	Right.
157000	158000	What did I say?
158000	160000	I don't know, not that though.
160000	161000	Okay, all right.
161000	169000	Rob, you had to give a stool sample recently.
169000	172000	You were explaining backstage.
172000	174000	I didn't give the stool sample.
174000	175000	You haven't done it yet.
175000	176000	I haven't done it yet.
176000	178000	But they told you to take a poop.
178000	179000	Yeah.
179000	185000	I was at the doctor and she said, okay, we're gonna have to take a, we're gonna get a stool sample.
185000	189000	And I was like, all right, well, it's the afternoon, I'll see what I can do.
189000	191000	Because you know me.
191000	192000	Right.
192000	195000	I'm an early morning kind of a guy.
195000	200000	And she says, okay, well here, we'll give you the kit and hands me a box.
200000	203000	And I was like, excuse me, kit, what?
203000	212000	And she says, yeah, you just follow the instructions that they take, it's a FedEx.
212000	218000	And I was like, is FedEx okay with this?
218000	219000	But they just give you a box.
219000	220000	They give you a box.
220000	221000	A box of a jar.
221000	222000	No, no.
222000	229000	It's got like two like medicine, you know, like, you know, orange little pill bottle things.
229000	235000	And it, and like a little long cotton swab thing, which I guess you're supposed to like
235000	238000	hockey puck it into the.
238000	241000	What's the cotton for?
241000	243000	No, no, it's a hockey puck thing.
243000	244000	Right.
244000	245000	But it's not, but it's not, there's no cotton.
245000	246000	You said there's a cotton swab.
246000	247000	Cotton swab.
247000	248000	Yeah, I guess.
248000	249000	But without the cotton.
249000	253000	Well, if it didn't have, without the cotton, it'd just be a stick.
253000	254000	And that's.
254000	258000	Isn't that what you should use to knock a turd into a bottle?
258000	260000	That would be really unsanitary.
260000	266000	But if they're gonna find cotton in your feces and say you're part sheep for.
266000	269000	I think, I think that's part of the process.
269000	270000	I think they got it figured out.
270000	274000	Did you eat a pair of jeans, sir?
274000	275000	I did not.
275000	279000	I'm supposed to mail it to Texas.
279000	281000	Where, where everything's bigger.
281000	282000	Right.
282000	285000	So that's why that's why it's two pill bottles.
285000	286000	Right.
286000	287000	Right.
287000	288000	Okay.
288000	289000	So, so, okay.
289000	292000	So, and then, so the box includes two bottles.
292000	297000	And an instruction and it said, and it comes with a big piece of like paper.
297000	303000	And the instruction says, well, I don't know what the terminology is, but it says, please
303000	309000	defecate on the paper and then provide the stool samples in the pill bottles.
309000	312000	And it says, and it provides you with the paper.
312000	313000	Does it edit?
313000	314000	Which is a little weird.
314000	316000	And the paper has a target on it.
316000	317000	No, it doesn't.
317000	319000	It has a fly on it.
319000	321000	Like, you know, in the urinals.
321000	322000	Yeah.
322000	323000	Yeah.
323000	326000	Girls, there's in urinals, there's like a little fly.
326000	330000	In the funnier urinals, it's like a like fly sticker.
330000	332000	You're supposed to pee on the fly.
332000	333000	Yeah.
333000	335000	And you get a.
335000	336000	I don't really get that.
336000	338000	You know what I do get and love?
338000	340000	A urinal filled with ice.
340000	341000	Oh man.
341000	344000	When you're, when you're lucky enough to like catch a urinal.
344000	347000	When they've like, they've like just dumped a bunch of ice into it.
347000	348000	Yeah.
348000	351000	You feel like you got heat vision coming out of your dick.
351000	352000	Yeah.
352000	354000	You feel like a mutant superhero.
354000	355000	Yeah.
355000	356000	Take care of this.
356000	358000	Melting glaciers.
358000	359000	Stand back, Wonder Woman.
359000	360000	Yeah.
360000	365000	This is a job for a slightly above room temperature pee.
365000	367000	And there's like steam coming off it.
367000	368000	Yeah.
368000	369000	Yeah.
369000	372000	You feel like a man finally.
372000	374000	Speaking of, speaking of poop.
374000	376000	I took a Brigadoon poop.
376000	378000	I'll explain what that means.
378000	382000	I was at Rick and Morty and I was in an edit session.
382000	385000	I got up from the edit bay to take a poop.
385000	387000	I said, I'm going to go take a poop.
387000	392000	And I went to the bathroom and I took a poop.
392000	393000	And it was long.
393000	394000	You know.
394000	395000	I did some tweets.
395000	396000	Long in time?
396000	397000	Yeah.
397000	398000	Long.
398000	399000	Yes.
399000	410000	I finished and then I like, I walked into the writer's room and I looked at one of the writers,
410000	411000	America.
411000	416240	And she was, because the boss just walked into the room, she's just like looking at
416240	417240	me kind of expectantly.
417240	421320	And then after a while ago, I know it was a long poop.
421320	424360	She didn't know what the hell I was talking about.
424360	425880	Because I had taken a Brigadoon poop.
425880	431840	I had lost time in the, I've never seen Brigadoon, but.
431840	432840	What are you doing?
432840	433840	I don't know the reference.
433840	437640	Well, I forgot where I, when I finished taking the poop, I forgot where I had been before
437640	442480	I started pooping and just walked into a new room thinking that that's where I was
442480	446720	and started talking to them about my poop as if I, as if I was bookending a conversation
446720	447720	about my shit.
447720	451320	And they're just like, okay, because they're paid to just listen.
451320	455200	And I was like, and then, and then I was like, so where were we?
455200	458760	And they're like, you were about to go into an edit session.
458760	463840	And I was like, oh, and then I went into the edit room and it was like, so it was a long
463840	464840	poop.
464840	465840	And they're like, yeah, it really was.
465840	472360	And I said, well, here's why, uh, is it dementia?
472360	478600	They just linked Prilosec to dementia is brick brick Brigadoon is, was it, did he have an
478600	486200	edit session Brigadoon was a town where you go and then you're like, oh, these people
486200	487560	are so cool.
487560	494020	And then, and then like, when you leave, you're older or they leave, like the town only appears
494020	498220	like on full moons at midnight or something or like, but if you're, if you're not out
498220	504540	of the town, then you have to stay in it forever because it, it's like, which episode was this?
504540	509580	Uh, it's, it's, it's like a, it's like some weird teleportation town where there's something
509580	513580	to do with the like, like old, old people or something.
513580	514580	Okay.
514580	515580	All right.
515580	516580	We'll bring up a Brigadoon expert.
516580	520900	Uh, uh, all right, look, yes, let's get on with it.
520900	524660	There's only so many things here that I could talk about that it would be more fun with
524660	525660	our guest.

603820	604820	Yeah.
604820	605820	Yeah.
606820	607820	Oh my God.
607820	608820	Oh no.
608820	615980	Just so we could get that whole tablecloth thing going on.
615980	616980	It's Plaidmageddon.
616980	617980	We look stupid.
617980	618980	Plaidmageddon.
618980	621260	I think we look hot.
621260	626420	I'm just wearing this to cover the fact that I'm wearing an inside out shirt right now.
626420	628500	You texted us today after you got home.
628500	633380	After we got off the flight and I got home from the flight after we had been together
633380	638900	all the time in the airport, you were like, I was like, Hey, did any of you notice that
638900	642380	my shirt was inside out the whole day?
642380	643380	And no, you didn't.
643380	644380	Nope.
644380	645380	Yeah.
645380	647500	This isn't a crowd to notice that.
647500	648500	No, no.
648500	649500	Yeah.
649500	650500	We were looking at the floor.
650500	656980	Is your shirt inside out or is it, it's, it's like an inside out like movie t-shirt with
656980	659940	the inside out look.
659940	662220	Because either way you're ashamed of it.
662220	663220	Yeah.
663540	669820	Dan lost an Oscar to inside out, so I could see why he would, you would be covering up
669820	670820	that.
670820	672820	So yes or no.
672820	673820	What?
673820	674820	No.
674820	676740	You know what I won when I lost that Oscar?
676740	677740	An integrity.
677740	684980	It's an award I gave myself.
684980	685980	The integries.
685980	686980	Yeah.
686980	687980	Oscars are for sellouts.
688740	693900	And you know, 18% of all integrity nominees are black.
693900	694900	Pretty cool.
694900	699340	It's reflective of the proportion of the population.
699340	703660	I haven't run those numbers, but yeah, probably.
703660	704860	Just saying it's a fair award.
704860	705860	It sounds right.
705860	706860	And it's a good one.
706860	707860	I have one of these.
707860	708860	And it's one that counts.
708860	709860	Yes.
709860	710860	All right.
710860	711860	So thank you for coming, Rob.
711860	712860	It was very flattering.
712860	717180	Because you said you, well, you're working in Miami because you're, you're on ballers.
717180	718180	Yeah.
718180	719180	Whoa.
719180	720180	Really?
720180	727180	I did not expect a big ballers crowd here tonight.
727180	730580	How does that schedule throughout the year where Children's Hospital is still happening?
730580	731580	When are you shooting that?
731580	732580	And when are you balling?
732580	733580	I'm like...
733580	734580	Nice.
734580	746420	I'm a, I shoot Children's Hospital, well, Shaw, we just ended the show.
746420	751340	I shoot it in the summer and then ballers happens around Halloween.
751340	752700	I leave on about Halloween.
752700	753700	I'm back in February.
753700	755700	So you did like a finale episode?
755700	756700	It's done?
756700	757700	No, we didn't.
757700	758700	Yeah.
758700	759700	It's done.
759700	760700	But Children's Hospital or balls?
760700	761700	Yeah.
761700	762700	No, Children's Hospital.
762700	768300	We decided to end it, not knowing that this season was going to be the last when we shot
768300	769300	it.
769300	775940	And, but the season is so good and for a lot of reasons I wanted to sort of move on and
775940	782860	do other things, but, uh, the finale is really the, like, was it the best season or I, I,
782860	787700	and, well, I say that every season, you know, I just, I like, like, I'm like, cause I would
787700	788700	never have that in me.
788700	791100	If I was like, yeah, this is the best season.
791100	793460	I'd be like, well, then I don't know about the best season.
793460	798020	I don't have a best season, but this was what, like, I would be proud to go out on this.
798020	799020	How many seasons?
799020	800020	How many seasons?
800020	801020	Seven.
801020	802020	Seven.
802020	803020	Yeah.
804020	805020	Which one?
805020	808020	I have, like, nine of them.
812020	815020	Uh, either, either one of them.
824020	825020	Either one of the nine.
825020	826020	Yeah.
826020	827020	Either one.
827020	830020	Community went to season six, as you know.
830020	831020	Yeah.
831020	833020	That was the season that you were the in-house director on.
833020	834020	Whoops.
834020	835020	And then we got canceled.
835020	836020	Whoops.
836020	837020	Whoops.
839020	842020	I wonder, what happened there?
844020	846020	Uh, Rick and Morty's on the third season.
846020	852020	We're writing about, we're about the, on the fourth episode of that.
852020	856020	And, uh, you know, and I'm doing a great minds on history.
856020	860020	I shoot that every weekend and, uh, I think the Jason Sudeikis episode was just up.
860020	861020	You want to do that?
861020	862020	You want to do that?
862020	863020	You want to be a historical figure?
863020	866020	It'd be weird for you to say no.
866020	867020	Give me the pick.
867020	869020	Give me the elevator pitch.
869020	873020	You come through, uh, you pick a historical figure, whatever you want.
873020	876020	Nah, I don't like it.
876020	880020	And then you're coming in the, in the conceit of the show is that Spencer has created a,
880020	883020	uh, a version of time travel to bring historical figures back.
883020	889020	It's like data fracking, like where you reach back and you grab the biological data from
889020	894020	a historical figure and then you shoot it into a, these pucks of Chinese lard and still
894020	897020	sounds a step, step, step, stem cells.
897020	899020	Um, this is the, the crawl.
899020	900020	Yeah.
901020	902020	That's just how it went.
902020	906020	This is just me acroiting for a second about our technology.
906020	912020	And then, so you come through as a naked, uh, confused historical figure, um, not realizing
912020	914020	that you're going to disintegrate in six hours.
914020	916020	And then we provide you with wardrobe based on who you are.
916020	918020	And then we do an episode.
918020	921020	I don't understand a word of what you just said, but I will do it.
921020	922020	Yes.
922020	923020	I'll do anything.
923020	924020	Yay.
929020	931020	Uh, but I was listening, I was in Miami.
931020	938020	I think you were getting to, I was listening to Harmon town the whole time because I'm
938020	939020	there.
939020	942020	I shoot all I'm the oldest person in the cast.
942020	946020	Um, so the rock is like 23, like three years on the rock.
946020	947020	Really?
947020	948020	Yeah.
948020	952020	And everybody else is, then there's a huge dip in the age.
952020	957020	Uh, and so, and Miami is just not my, uh, it's not really my scene.
957020	959020	It's not a lot for me there.
959020	963020	I mean, everyone in Miami, when we went there to do the show, like all of our fans are,
963020	965020	I wouldn't say there's a same from city to city.
965020	972020	All of our fans are snowflakes, but they're, they are also, it's like a Miami.
972020	978020	It's a, it's essentially going to be perfectly compatible with a Los Angeles, Armenian.
978020	983020	Um, therefore all of the Miami people that came to that show where the guy got punched
983020	989020	in the face by his friend in what was either an Andy Kaufman ask, uh, no, he never explained
989020	990020	it.
990020	994020	I mean, I think he did on Reddit and I think it just started, I think we sort of stowed
994020	999020	or got the general intuition that these guys are just kind of, they just punch each other
999020	1000020	like Beavis and butt head.
1000020	1004020	And like, like, like, like Beavis is a little more on the ball and butt head was office
1004020	1010020	meds and like, like, like it wasn't, it wasn't a totally non-consensual, uh, punch.
1010020	1011020	Yeah.
1011020	1014020	It was like sort of like, this is what we do.
1014020	1016020	How old were these people?
1016020	1018020	Uh, I don't know.
1018020	1019020	Everyone's 25.
1019020	1020020	Right.
1020020	1021020	Right.
1021020	1022020	Right.
1022020	1023020	Oh, they were young.
1023020	1024020	I'm assuming they were older.
1024020	1025020	I don't know why.
1025020	1027020	If they were older, I'd be into it.
1027020	1032020	Like I, you know, if they were like our age, like we understand mortality.
1032020	1033020	Yeah.
1033020	1034020	Yeah.
1034020	1035020	The legal system.
1035020	1037020	Well, it would be like, yeah.
1037020	1041020	Like how valuable a tooth is when it gets knocked out, how expensive it is to fix.
1041020	1042020	Oh.
1042020	1043020	And like, like, like, yeah.
1043020	1044020	So it would be like fight club.
1044020	1047020	It'd be like, I had Norton coming up and the Brad Pitt running up and punching him.
1047020	1049020	We're bottle lining it the whole time.
1049020	1053260	But no, when they're 25, it's like you guys just doing this because you're so much face
1054260	1055260	punching.
1055260	1062260	Um, I, uh, so, so my, yeah, my, but that is to say, so everybody in Miami at the Miami
1062260	1063260	show was like, Miami sucks.
1063260	1064260	We're so sorry.
1064260	1065260	Miami sucks.
1065260	1066260	We're so sorry.
1066260	1067260	And it was like, Miami doesn't suck.
1067260	1068260	You're great.
1068260	1070260	But now that we're safely back in LA, Miami sucks.
1070260	1071260	It sucks.
1071260	1072260	It sucks.
1072260	1073260	Totally sucks.
1073260	1074260	Like it's a swamp.
1074260	1076260	It's a swamp full of manic.
1076260	1078260	I mean, it's, it's a cultural.
1078260	1081260	And those guys specifically have to get out.
1081260	1082260	Yeah.
1082260	1083260	Yeah.
1083260	1088460	If you're listening to this and you're in Miami, you're not going to get a golden invitation
1088460	1092060	because no one wants Florida people coming anywhere.
1092060	1097260	But you're, if you're listening to this, you're, you're dying to get a car and go.
1097260	1098260	Yeah.
1098260	1099260	Just leave, man.
1099260	1101260	No, you don't need, you don't need anything.
1101260	1103260	Buy a ticket to nowhere, man.
1103260	1104260	Right.
1104260	1107220	All you can do is go up.
1107220	1111900	Everything in Miami is the demographic equivalent of smoking a pack a day.
1111900	1117900	You're just, you're just inviting statistical entropy.
1117900	1122980	Like every, every breath you take in that city is, it brings you closer to the, your
1122980	1126220	inevitable demise.
1126220	1130220	Levy was shit talking it cause he went to school there.
1130220	1131940	And so he was like, Miami sucks.
1131940	1134020	I was like, why don't you take it easy?
1134020	1137660	And then the kid got punched by another kid who's his friend and there was no security
1137660	1138660	at the show.
1138660	1144300	And you know, yeah, Miami's, uh, I would be, I would be really, really, you said, because
1144300	1149100	you said you've done it with Pete Holmes podcast, Duncan Trussell's podcast, the first season
1149100	1155700	I did it with like, I just, I went home after working and, uh, I, and I'm not kidding.
1155700	1160540	This sounds like an exaggeration, but I would sit in my underwear at my kitchen table doing
1160540	1164780	jigsaw puzzles, drinking and listening to podcasts.
1164780	1171180	And last year it was, uh, Pete Holmes and Duncan Trussell, but fuck those guys.
1171180	1172180	So spiritual.
1172180	1173180	Yeah.
1173180	1174180	Oh God.
1174180	1176060	And this year it was a Harmon town.
1176060	1180940	And so these were the, like, cause I needed, I didn't talk to anybody outside of work.
1180940	1184380	It was, I was just alone losing my identity.
1184380	1186900	And I would just, uh, I needed voices.
1187340	1192860	I needed, it's such a miracle that you're not a coke addict because that's what, that's
1192860	1193860	how it happens.
1193860	1196900	It was 10 years ago, I'd be a full on coke addict.
1196900	1201380	I feel like, I feel like if I was 43 and I was in that situation, I'd be like, well,
1201380	1202380	my hands are tied.
1202380	1203380	Gotta be a coke addict.
1203380	1204380	Yeah.
1204380	1209460	This is what I'm doing for a while in Miami and I have, I don't like jigsaw puzzles.
1209460	1210460	Yeah.
1210460	1214820	Uh, but, but yeah, you said you're listening to ours backwards.
1214940	1215940	I was listening to them backwards.
1215940	1216940	Yeah.
1216940	1222500	From, uh, like, like, like backwards, like backwards.
1222500	1228260	And I suggest you all listen to them backwards because there's a lot of messages.
1228260	1235460	You think this is all like non-scripted, but he plans this whole thing and there's a, there's
1235460	1236460	a message.
1236460	1237460	Yeah.
1237460	1238740	There's a lot of hidden conspiracy stuff.
1238740	1241860	When we're talking about 9 11, if you play it backwards, we're actually talking about
1241860	1243860	9 11.
1244500	1254780	Like, like, this, this, this podcast is crawling with 9 11, uh, but yeah, and he said, listening
1254780	1255780	to it backwards.
1255780	1257580	And then you're like, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's weird.
1257580	1261780	I mean the, the role playing games, I mean, obviously those, well, actually, I guess those
1261780	1262780	make just as much sense.
1262780	1263780	But it's great.
1263780	1264780	Yeah.
1264780	1266060	They make just as much sense backwards.
1266060	1267060	That's the thing.
1267060	1274020	But I was like, uh, after I got to, uh, I got a couple of years down and no, I was really
1274020	1276700	like binging, binging this.
1276700	1277700	Yeah.
1277700	1278700	Thank you.
1278700	1279700	I got a wow.
1279700	1280700	Wow.
1280700	1281700	Like, respect.
1281700	1282700	Respect.
1282700	1290180	Uh, I was binge and I got a couple down and I, then I started skipping back, uh, you know,
1290180	1296460	I'd skip back 10 and I'd save some and, and, uh, and then, um, and then all of a sudden
1296460	1301140	we were, cause I started in shadow run and then all of a sudden I was in D and D where
1301140	1302140	it all started.
1302140	1306380	Oh, then I skipped way back to Spencer's first episode.
1306380	1307380	That was awesome.
1307380	1315420	That was awesome because he was like, I called him, I, it's not even that it doesn't make
1315420	1318660	much sense, but I tell my, my wife is like, she called me and she'd be like, what are
1318660	1319660	you doing?
1319660	1325740	I was like, uh, doing jiggies and listening to my friends, but you are my friend and you're
1325740	1327260	my friend.
1327260	1329620	But Spencer, I consider one of my friends.
1329620	1334500	He was just like one of my buddies, Jeff, one of my, but one of my good friend, like
1334500	1335980	the voices filling the room.
1335980	1336980	Yeah.
1336980	1339100	And then I, I saw that it was like an origin story.
1339100	1343580	It was like reading the origin story after getting into the comic book.
1343580	1344580	Yeah.
1344580	1349740	That part of the podcast phenomenon, it's a lot like I've always compared it to when
1349740	1355460	I would come home from school back when basic cable was first, was, was the internet basically
1355460	1356860	in terms of media.
1356860	1360740	Um, the, my mom got addicted to home shopping networks.
1360740	1362420	Uh, it's pretty good.
1362420	1366060	And, and, and, and I would come home from school and my mom would be at like a sewing
1366060	1368020	machine or, or, or cooking.
1368020	1371780	I look, it wasn't, it was a, it was a simpler time.
1371780	1372780	Yeah.
1372780	1379540	She, she, she, she, she, she voluntarily, uh, waived her agency, uh, uh, that's what
1379540	1380540	we did back then.
1380540	1381540	Suburbs.
1381540	1384660	I, I, uh, wave my agency.
1384660	1389660	I, I, I, do you, do you promise to fail the big del test with this man forever?
1389660	1390660	I do.
1390660	1397740	Um, the, the, the, the, the, there's a thing called the big del test.
1397740	1398740	Shrops parents are here.
1398740	1401780	I keep thinking, how are they, I didn't know what that was either though.
1401780	1402940	So I'm with you guys.
1402940	1404180	Well, don't make me explain it.
1404180	1405180	It'll take 20 minutes.
1405180	1406180	No, okay.
1406180	1409180	But I was just pretending, I was cool pretending I knew what it was.
1409180	1411180	Was that like a Brigadoon situation?
1411180	1412180	No.
1412180	1413180	Um.
1413180	1414180	Yeah.
1414180	1417460	Can we talk about poop again?
1417460	1419900	Because that's like right in my wheelhouse.
1419900	1423700	Um, wait, where was I?
1423700	1424700	Something important.
1424700	1425700	You were explaining.
1425700	1426700	Yeah.
1426700	1427700	Yeah.
1427700	1429060	It was just personality addiction.
1429060	1433300	Like I would come home from school and my mom would, would be explaining to me what
1433300	1436260	happened on the home shopping network.
1436260	1437620	Here's some things that never happened.
1437620	1438620	She never bought anything.
1439060	1443060	She wasn't, she wasn't like getting roped into some like compulsive consumption thing.
1443060	1447500	She just couldn't, you know, she couldn't let it go that these people were on TV all
1447500	1451980	the time and that there was no script and that they were there, you know, honking for
1451980	1455420	people that were calling in and then the same people would call in and go, I bought this
1455420	1456420	bracelet too.
1456420	1457420	And honk honk.
1457420	1461900	Um, and it was like, it doesn't, it, it, I remember, you know, I marked that because
1461900	1466460	when Aaron McGathey, my lovely ex wife and who introduced me to the podcast culture and
1466460	1471940	Dustin Marshall and Duncan Tressel, um, like she was explaining how she, when she first
1471940	1475980	met Duncan Tressel, she, she felt like she made kind of a social blunder because she
1475980	1480300	forgot until halfway through their encounter that she didn't know him.
1480300	1484140	Um, and, and, and that she might have been transgressing boundaries or something.
1484140	1487620	I had that experience with, I don't, I've never met Duncan Tressel and I saw him in
1487620	1492780	a parking lot and I was like, there's my buddy, there's my good buddy, Duncan.
1492780	1497060	And I almost, and that was, and I could have just gone up and said hello and introduced
1497060	1500900	myself, but I didn't because, uh, I felt like a weirdo.
1500900	1501900	Yeah.
1501900	1507740	Well, uh, you, you, you dodged a bullet cause he's a notorious dick that whole character
1507740	1509620	he does on the podcast.
1509620	1510620	It's a character.
1510620	1511660	I kind of, that's why I abandoned it.
1511660	1516340	I kind of thought so he's, he's out like, um, right now he's running reruns of his podcast
1516340	1518380	cause he's with an impersonator.
1518380	1519380	Yeah.
1519380	1522220	My brother does an impression of him on his podcast.
1522220	1524340	He's out, uh, raising money for Trump.
1524340	1525340	Yeah.
1525340	1527540	That's not true.
1527540	1528540	That's not true.
1528540	1529540	Don't say that.
1529540	1536220	Why would you say that you say you cross the line saying mean things about somebody who's
1536220	1539380	really nice.
1539380	1540380	Why is he doing that?
1540380	1545100	He is really like Duncan Tressel is kind of unassailable for sure.
1546100	1547100	Yeah.
1547100	1552380	Cancer tried to assail him and he invited us into the process of one of his testicles.
1552380	1556940	He lost his mom, you know, and, and invite us into that process.
1556940	1558300	You're a comic book fan.
1558300	1559300	Yeah.
1559300	1563180	What do you think of this underoos line in this Avengers trailer?
1563180	1566220	Uh, uh, uh, sorry.
1566220	1568100	I'm just, that's anticipation.
1568100	1569100	That's all that is.
1569100	1570100	Wait, wait, wait.
1570100	1571100	I don't know it.
1571100	1573140	The Avengers trailer is the civil war trailer.
1573140	1574140	Have you seen the new one?
1574180	1576180	I don't know about underoos.
1576180	1579020	Well, Spider-Man is in the, the latest trailer.
1579020	1580020	Have you seen?
1580020	1581020	Oh, I know.
1581020	1582020	I haven't seen the latest trailer.
1582020	1583020	Okay.
1583020	1584020	Well, let me explain.
1584020	1585020	But you can bet I'm going to watch the shit out of it.
1585020	1586020	Watch it.
1586020	1587020	On the way home.
1587020	1590220	So, so everybody, so all the Avengers are there.
1590220	1591220	There's Iron Man.
1591220	1593220	There's, you got your, uh, black widow.
1593220	1594220	Yeah.
1594220	1601220	You got your, uh, you got the black, you got the whole gang.
1601220	1602220	The black.
1602300	1604300	The, uh, the, uh, Hawk.
1604300	1606300	You got, you got Hawkeye.
1606300	1607300	All the Hawks.
1607300	1608300	Silver Wings.
1608300	1609300	Yep.
1609300	1610300	You got Walter Lance.
1610300	1611300	Yep.
1611300	1612300	Walter Lance.
1612300	1613300	You got everybody's there.
1613300	1615300	Walter Lance is an Avenger.
1615300	1620300	He, he has the power to show you how to draw Woody Woodpecker.
1620300	1626860	But then, you know, they're all gonna, they're all gonna clash and then, you know, they face
1626860	1635820	off and then, uh, Robert Downey Jr. goes underoos and a spider web comes out and grabs
1635820	1641500	Captain America's shield and pulls it out of his hand and then they cut to Spider-Man
1641500	1644900	holding the shield and everybody's supposed to go, oh fuck, mic drop.
1644900	1646540	It's a big.
1646540	1647540	Mic drop.
1647540	1648540	Yeah.
1648540	1650940	But I go underoos.
1650940	1651940	He says underoos.
1651940	1652940	I go.
1652940	1653940	Wait, he just says the word underoos?
1653940	1654940	He says underoos.
1654940	1655940	Yeah.
1656020	1657020	Spider-Man.
1657020	1658020	He's calling Spider-Man.
1658020	1659020	Oh.
1659020	1660020	But that means.
1660020	1661020	He's like, yo, underoos.
1661020	1662020	That's a stretch.
1662020	1663020	You know what?
1663020	1666220	That doesn't make me think the movie's gonna be that good because that's the moment.
1666220	1672660	Because does that mean that Spider-Man has merchandising in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
1672660	1674940	since the 70s?
1674940	1677220	So that means he's 10 years older than I am.
1677220	1680020	But wait, why, okay, who's calling him underoos?
1680020	1681020	Robert Downey Jr.
1681020	1683020	Listen to the trailer.
1683620	1687620	So he, so he, that's his nickname for Spider-Man.
1687620	1688620	Right.
1688620	1689620	Spider-Man.
1689620	1690620	Who he's met as.
1690620	1691620	Hanging out with.
1691620	1692620	Until.
1692620	1693620	And he's chosen to call him underoos.
1693620	1694620	Underoos.
1694620	1695620	Yeah.
1695620	1698460	So, so let's, I just want to run down all the Avengers that we've met in the Cinematic
1698460	1699460	Universe.
1699460	1700460	Go ahead.
1700460	1701460	And run that through the check of.
1701460	1702460	Frankie Pans.
1702460	1703460	Why he wouldn't have used that as a nickname for.
1703460	1704460	You got your Captain America.
1704460	1705460	Chumba Wumba.

1716900	1717900	Yep.
1717900	1718900	Um.
1718900	1719900	Uh.
1719900	1720900	You got cold front.
1720900	1721900	Yeah.
1721900	1722900	Uh.
1722900	1723900	Salad tosser.
1723900	1724900	Yeah.
1724900	1725900	Icebreaker.
1725900	1726900	Uh.
1726900	1727900	Crouton unrelated to salad tosser.
1727900	1728900	So many.
1728900	1729900	Man.
1729900	1730900	Thousand Island.
1730900	1731900	So many beloved.
1731900	1732900	Uh.
1732900	1733900	There's a whole.
1733900	1734900	Thousand Island.
1734900	1735900	That was actually my favorite Avengers offshoot.
1735900	1736900	Right.
1736900	1737900	Was just the salad days.
1737900	1738900	As though they called it.
1738900	1739900	Uh.
1740340	1741340	It was just about the.
1741340	1743340	It was a crouton salad tosser.
1743340	1744340	Thousand Island.
1744340	1745340	And then they started forcing it.
1745340	1746340	It was like napkin and fork.
1746340	1747340	Yeah.
1747340	1748340	Yeah.
1748340	1749340	But.
1749340	1750340	But it was.
1750340	1751340	Napkin fork.
1751340	1752340	It was cool because it was cheeky.
1752340	1753340	It was like.
1753340	1754340	It had less supervision over that.
1754340	1755340	That franchise.
1755340	1756340	It was like Howard the Duck.
1756340	1757340	Yeah.
1757340	1758340	Yeah.
1758340	1759340	It was fun.
1759340	1760340	It was fun.
1760340	1761340	It was fun.
1761340	1762340	All along.
1762340	1763340	By the way I saw Deadpool and I really enjoyed it.
1763340	1764340	I love.
1764340	1765340	I saw it twice.
1765340	1766340	I saw it twice.
1766340	1767340	There's only one.
1767340	1768340	The one I died where I just had to like go.
1768340	1769340	Okay.
1769780	1770780	And keep enjoying the movie.
1770780	1771780	What was it?
1771780	1775860	It was the moment when they did the CG thing and then like in the middle of it he has
1775860	1776860	a line.
1776860	1778120	He can do any line.
1778120	1779120	It doesn't matter.
1779120	1780340	All it has to be is lateral.
1780340	1781340	That's it.
1781340	1782580	And he said.
1782580	1783580	To my memory.
1783580	1787220	Maybe I'm wrong about this but I've been writing more often on this show than everyone
1787220	1788220	on the show.
1788220	1792220	Check the records.
1792220	1796260	He says did I leave the stove on.
1796260	1797260	That's a bummer.
1797780	1798780	Not only.
1798780	1799780	First of all.
1799780	1800780	It's did I leave the oven on.
1800780	1801780	Second of all.
1801780	1802780	The fact that I know.
1802780	1803780	It's.
1803780	1804780	Something.
1804780	1805780	Means it's hack.
1805780	1806780	Yeah.
1806780	1807780	Like what.
1807780	1811100	But it's you don't leave the stove on the stove has fire coming out of it.
1811100	1814220	The oven is something you can leave on an airplane joke.
1814220	1815220	It's either.
1815220	1816220	Yeah.
1816220	1817220	It's.
1817220	1818220	Did I leave the iron.
1818220	1819220	Did I leave the iron on.
1819220	1820220	It's an airplane.
1820220	1821220	Yeah.
1821220	1822220	It's a book.
1822220	1823220	It's a placeholder for like.
1823220	1824220	He could have said anything.
1824220	1825220	That was a place.
1825220	1826220	It was such a funny movie.
1826220	1828860	I laughed out loud and couldn't stop laughing and the right.
1828860	1829860	I'm not good.
1829860	1830860	No spoilers.
1830860	1836460	But like like like Ryan Reynolds character avoiding spoilers by choosing my words carefully
1836460	1841620	like like what he's in a he's in a scene where he's still he's still Ryan Reynolds and he's
1841620	1849660	with his girlfriend and he but he's he's like oh I had this I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.
1849660	1855220	You know I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it but but and that's funny
1855220	1859340	I chuckled and then he crawled into bed and it was like during the scene that's very intense
1859340	1864820	and the execution of it he goes he crawls into bed and he holds her and there's something
1864820	1868740	in the air in the scene that's just like it's worthy of you know you're like well and he
1868740	1876260	goes hey you know they made like three of those movies after a while you just start
1876260	1881940	thinking is this guy a bad parent it was just really funny like it was it was played straight
1881940	1885460	up the middle and yeah that that the whole movie is filled with that stuff in a world
1885460	1890620	where like and I walked out of there thinking well I'd never now I get it why so many harm
1890620	1895700	in town fans or people on reddit and stuff they like Deadpool and kind of like you must
1895700	1900220	be a big Deadpool fan and I would chiefly because of that I'd be like well I can put
1900220	1905340	a pin in that and I just you know I never knew what that meant he was the meta superhero
1905340	1910100	and stuff but I love the like based on the movie I'm like oh I get it that's why people
1910100	1914860	would think that and I do I do you guys think too and you're you guys like comic books right
1914860	1922460	like you do you think that movie I was suspicious I wasn't sure that they were gonna be able
1922460	1930820	to do what that comic does in the movie because he's meta in a specific way yeah very like
1930820	1936220	only Deadpool way and yeah and it's hard to do bad or it's easy to do bad meta yeah very
1936220	1946940	easy yeah fall into that trap you can't just break the I don't know what you mean do you
1946940	1964300	know what he means like just lazy fourth wall breaking yeah but it was really good it was like
1964300	1972660	really in the somehow I don't know why or what but it was in the spirit of the comic under roo
1972660	1978900	under roo that's the third act this is a tough thing with these comic book movies like I honestly
1978900	1984540	I you know like I thought it was great you know I don't know I could have done without the fucking
1984540	1989060	other the other mutants like that I've never heard of because that's the ones that gets
1989060	1993100	better they made a joke about like how these are like low-rent Marvel characters that they're
1993180	1998460	letting them use but also just the whole third act was like kind of like it was it wasn't worthy
1998460	2003780	of the cleverness of that I thought it was like Sony taking possession of that character like fully
2003780	2013940	like also he's gonna be an X-Men movies so fuck you Disney well what what anyways did Wolverine
2013940	2018940	like hang out what Wolverine he talks about him a couple times you haven't seen the movie now come
2018940	2024780	on yeah I think you'd like it Rob that's well cuz remember you know what the second I saw it I
2024780	2029540	was like you know who really liked this Rob Trump no you didn't say that I did you did I said did my
2029540	2038860	wife never met you I said you know who really liked this and she said who and I paused for a
2038860	2047940	minute and then right at the right time I said Rob Schwab and she went yeah that makes sense
2049940	2056500	so I don't know I should I should go see it yeah can you tell all right well obviously the
2056500	2063780	answer is not if they're good ones but can you tell us any rock stories well what do you mean
2063780	2069300	like I just mean like well here's the thing like like like I keep I've always heard the rocks is
2069300	2075100	really he's really really awesome like like like like guy and I'm like if that's true that's worth
2075100	2079820	talking about yeah but if it's not true that's the only thing you can say anyway it's very true so
2079820	2085340	like that's why a lot of people ask me that and they're like so what's the what's the rock like
2085340	2091660	and what they mean is tell us about what do you really like because we all like him right even
2091660	2096700	people that hate everything like him right like Schwarzenegger like you know like Schwarzenegger at
2096700	2104340	his age yeah like the most cynical comic still like tweets at Paul F Tompkins the other day not that
2104340	2117980	he's the most cynical comic but he was like love the rock you know about Paul's problem he
2117980	2128500	wasn't talking about the actor that's really insensitive that's really insensitive yeah Paul's
2128500	2133020	a good friend of ours that's really I think it's an extra sensitive our friend needs help and what
2133020	2140820	are you doing about it you're like whatever pays the rent keeps keeps keeps smoking that glass
2140820	2149860	the pipe PFT to keep that chimney billowing and money he looks like a crackhead doesn't he looks
2149860	2154900	like one acts like one yes everything it all adds up I don't think you do come on I think you're
2154900	2162700	beautiful human being wait you're really playing it safe tonight I know I wonder why you know what
2162700	2173780	the F and Paul F Tompkins stands for fucking crack and that's a straight-up fact or and PFT if you're
2173780	2181780	listening show us the birth certificate if I'm wrong yeah I want yours to prove if he doesn't
2181780	2188740	respond to this I'm right balls in your court Tompkins if that's even your real name so you're
2188740	2194380	a Boston guy right yeah like how old were you when you went from Boston to Los Angeles or New

2496460	2503460	stop pretending that kids aren't growing up in a certain way let's cater to these short attention
2503460	2509180	span you know you know you know how it's all like this episode of Sesame Street is brought to you
2509180	2514620	by the letter T yeah brought to you by the letter S the idea was that kids were being raised you
2514620	2521700	and I were being raised by televisions and that we trusted and listened to commercials and things
2521700	2526300	like that and the children's television workshop was saying why don't we do this why don't we try
2526300	2531020	this and also you know maybe this thing that's not called diversity yet we should try that too
2531020	2534900	yeah right and so it was a whole controversial thing it was like because people were like well
2534900	2539220	that's not chaining them to a desk and making them read where the red fern grows that's like
2539220	2544540	or you know it's like like like education should be austere which by the way you know same thing
2544540	2548940	with religion like we always talk about it's like they insist on the church pews being things you
2548940	2554220	know if there's a cushion on the church pew oh you're Unitarian you know it's it's it's it's like
2554220	2559860	well yeah but these church pews were state-of-the-art like like and a guy talking in front of an altar
2559860	2566340	in English was stated it was a laser show at a certain point stained glass windows were like
2566340	2573060	yeah Pink Floyd concerts yep yep yep yep anyway so all I'm saying is because now we're starting to
2573060	2576740	talk about oh I saw a kid at the airport and he was reading a magazine he was trying to pinch
2576740	2583940	and zoom the magazine and then he threw it away this happened yes oh I've heard that story three
2583940	2592100	different times no kids if you hand them a magazine they will try to pinch and zoom the
2592100	2599540	fucking magazine yes a three-year-old kid kids learn three years old I oh my god I've watched
2599540	2608660	and I said at breakfast with what's his name Jeremy Bruckheimer I know okay now I've said too
2608660	2619540	much little Jeremy little cute Jeremy Bruckheimer oh my gosh yeah I could see that um but he's one
2619540	2626900	of the bastard Bruckheimer's he goes by Jeremy Snow he's not officially allowed to be a Bruckheimer
2626900	2633940	he's just wandering north of the wall pinch and grab a magazine I can't believe you find that
2633940	2640260	hard to believe you try to pinch and zoom a magazine no kidding
2644420	2649460	if you give a three-year-old kid a book or magazine okay let's get one
2651460	2656180	they they will they of course because they're growing up on ipads it's not a it's not a big
2656180	2661460	deal because by the way cutting down a tree and mashing it with chemicals into a pulp that you
2661460	2666580	can turn into a piece of paper and using a Gutenberg press to like stamp ink onto it that's
2666580	2670580	the iPad of its time and it's not like people then weren't going like oh there goes in the
2670580	2675380	neighborhood you know like about these books like we just look at that as like oh god these precious
2675380	2680820	books it's like like like who cares if the kids are learning from ipads the the but the thing is
2682500	2687860	somewhere between surrendering to that stuff and like it actually being part of our culture is
2687940	2692660	like this morass of like just chaos where we're like oh I wouldn't want to have a kid I don't
2692660	2697940	know what they're learning it's like some Jim Henson needs to say look kids are learning from
2697940	2703460	ipads and like like like outside of trying to make a dollar by selling some dumb app that's like like
2703460	2710660	learn to use alphabets I don't know like like like we still we need that we need that we need that
2710660	2716820	passion so if you're out there and you're living in Miami and you love kids you own a van
2718100	2723060	just get into the back of it and and start tinkering with something that will help them
2723060	2733220	for a change yeah you've taken so much so far give back give back silicon van you know I mean
2733220	2738020	I think silicon valley's had enough I think a more mobile silicon valley all around the world silicon
2738020	2744340	van silicon van tomorrow's silicon van is a window valley is a windowless white van driving
2744340	2750820	out of Miami into yeah I mean not for nothing if you put Roiland three programmers and like some
2750820	2755060	kind of a driver type guy and you know some kind of a wild card that made sure everything was like
2755060	2758980	kind of all right I bet those guys would come out with a hell of a game in six months

2850980	2854980	say this but I'll say this about both of the parents like Donna and David like you guys have
2854980	2860980	like uh Dorian gray portraits somewhere like you're frozen in time you guys are you guys are like
2860980	2867380	like I I'm I'm turning into just I've gone past Michael Moore and I'm now just like I'm just
2867460	2871460	melting into a puddle of of whatever Kevin Smith uh
2874820	2878500	like like like like cleans out of himself in the morning no I'm not dissing him I'm saying
2879380	2884100	I'm saying like I'm beyond like I'm just like I've turned into protoplasm like I'm just like
2884100	2890420	slowly melting I'm like like like but you guys are you guys are just the same image you know
2890420	2894900	you're just you're just Donna and David Trump that's nice I mean it's not it's not important
2895140	2899620	they haven't stopped smiling since I met them in the green room they're sweet people and here's
2899620	2904820	the thing about Rob like you know like it's it's through meeting shrub and then meeting his parents
2904820	2910340	that I started to gain insight into the fact that creative types we create our own mythology behind
2910340	2914900	us because Rob would be like the only stories you'd hear about his his upbringing because you're
2914900	2918500	like hanging out with a creative and you're like 20 years old you're just like bolstering each other
2918580	2924020	and going like yeah this is the saddest bullshit punk rock and you know I'd hear a story about
2924020	2930980	like well one day my mom hid all my comic books or one day you know uh but you know and then I
2930980	2935060	and then I met you and it's like oh she's a sweetheart she's not hitting me with a belt she's
2936340	2940020	she's great uh and I think I do think that this is a nightmare
2940020	2949140	like like talk about talk about talk about anything you want by the way but
2950100	2957140	just talk about like what what did did Rob have weird privates when he was born or yeah like
2959220	2966980	like do you remember him eating his own shit or no no okay I'm curious about that should I walk
2967060	2973700	around the block for a bit no you should sit there keep one camera on him uh I don't know what
2973700	2978340	you wait what's the important question when did when did when did Robbie by the way his name on
2978340	2984340	his birth certificate Robbie Schwab Robbie Christopher yeah not Robert not not Rob yeah
2984340	2990340	Robbie was on the person didn't you didn't like Robert she didn't like she's going like this
2990340	2997060	podcast at home that actually didn't help like this that didn't help it up that's pumped
2997060	3001700	she let me do it again for the listeners she's going like this
3008580	3016900	oh boy oh boy did when when what was it what was the what was the moment when you uh when you
3016900	3028820	really knew Rob was different yeah Dan's doing air quote special yeah go ahead well he was always
3028820	3035460	drawing he was always drawing in fact when he was in second grade and they had to do cursive writing
3035460	3041780	and it had to be very neat but Rob would go on the margin and he'd draw all these little pictures
3041780	3047860	and the teacher would say I never reprimanded him because I was always anxious to see what
3047860	3053860	he drew in the margins this is the best
3057860	3062500	by the way I know it feels unnatural because we're I'm I'm I'm Midwestern too but you get
3062500	3067220	put you put your put your lips like this distance from the mic like so just so we can hear all this
3067220	3074740	tenderness um so so so Rob does that match up with your mom mom was a supporter she was an ally
3074740	3083780	well I was there I don't remember all the teachers being very happy about me not doing homework
3086740	3092500	all right well but you know so he told everybody when he was at the high school graduation he had
3092500	3099780	to give a speech and the first thing he said was I was the worst high school student in all of
3099780	3108900	navel it's true I'm telling you you gotta just eat that mic you gotta eat it okay it doesn't feel
3108900	3115620	natural okay okay your voice booming but it's okay so all right so what's the worst discipline
3115620	3122260	problem Rob ever presented like like what was like a big family drama like like oh man we got
3122260	3133780	to punish this kid no he was always cute oh come on that is true no come on that is true but you
3133780	3140500	know what he used to do when he was like three eat his own shit eat his own shit and wait don't
3140500	3149780	say yet I want to like anticipate it a little bit more he loved going to the tub being naked yeah
3150900	3154660	and then this was at a time when everybody wore cowboy boots sure
3158020	3167140	or so he told you so he put yeah so he would always go and put dave's cowboy boots on and
3167140	3176980	walk around the house naked yeah yes yes yes you're kind of proud of that
3179300	3185300	with a badge of honor with a pacifier in his we did it this afternoon god bless him we did it this
3185300	3195540	afternoon yeah dad brought the boots off from Wisconsin it was pretty hard to get rid of the
3195540	3203140	pacifier I called it my noony yes you called it your noony until the day you went into the bathroom
3203140	3210260	and you looked straight at me and you took it and you went right into the toilet wait and then stuck
3210260	3217700	it in his mouth yeah wait what and before the day was over with I had taken it away and threw
3217700	3223700	it away and he asked where it was and I said I don't know where it is wait what was it a spoon
3223700	3228660	I didn't miss the top of that pacifier oh yeah he's washed it off in the toilet like a monkey
3228660	3238020	with a potato monkey with a potato what what I'm just an animal to you did you have a word for his
3238020	3245700	pacifier like binky or booboo or noony noony okay noony just said that okay look I was I said
3245700	3252500	it on another podcast too you have no interest in my life nothing
3255540	3263540	Donna how old were you when you and David got married I was 21 wow see kids all right we were
3263540	3271700	raised by no could you imagine having children and I was kid too when when when you were raising
3271700	3279860	me when you were a child no no no no no like you had Jeff before me and then me yes and you were
3279860	3288340	21 when you had me right no no what did you just say yeah 21 when I got married and I got married
3288340	3294180	and then two years later Jeff came and then three years later you came and then four years later I
3294180	3299700	can't imagine having that was such a huge epiphany for me was in in Hollywood my first one-bedroom
3299700	3306580	apartment I needed to get a driver's license I needed my birth certificate I was 20 I was in
3306580	3313620	my early 20s I think it was 23 because and and so I and I for the first time I bothered to just read
3313620	3317860	my birth certificate from left to right going down there's like there's a baby footprint and
3317860	3322660	there's other things and then it's like my parents were 23 when they had me I'm the youngest of three
3322660	3328260	kids they got married when they were out of high school which is not uncommon baby boomer
3328260	3334020	generation only it's like who else am I gonna meet there's no internet let's make it work
3334420	3344340	um and and it's like oh my god I was 23 standing in a sea of empty pizza boxes and frankly mannequin
3344340	3351460	parts and yeah no I was a child yeah and I was like if I was in charge of another person's life
3351460	3356260	and I have been in the form of any social relationships and I've been made a disaster
3356260	3362500	out of all of them all my journals when I was 21 yeah the least responsible person
3363140	3367140	and here we are like like what again I was like oh man I've been bitching about my parents since
3367140	3372500	I was 13 you know like like like and it's like wait oh well they but they did kind of accomplish
3372500	3379140	something here yeah that was a turning point uh not that I ever became a nice person to my parents
3379140	3388260	or anything with it because it's fine anybody but your dad also it should be noted like your dad
3388260	3394500	like your your mom kind of is the she's sort of the rock star of your of your of your family
3394500	3399700	because she's adorable and saying that in front of my dad because your dad's a stand-up guy and
3399700	3404500	he's like he's got he's got that perma granted it's not it's not insincere and he was wait
3404500	3410740	weren't you in the navy david or what was it yeah he's I mean he's in submarines he's a he's a he's
3410740	3415620	a gentleman and a stand-up guy and like uh I don't know he never like like we never shine a spotlight
3415620	3419060	on him I'm not suggesting we do I don't know what would happen he makes their karate chopping us
3419060	3424660	with uh there might be like manchurian candidate like yeah yeah yeah programming inside of him
3424660	3429620	don't bring that up we'll activate but but I don't know your your parents are wonderful
3429620	3433300	people and they they got married when they were 21 and they're still together and they
3433380	3435940	50 years yeah wow wait
3443140	3448020	I don't know if that'll happen I don't know if anyone listening to this podcast will ever
3448020	3453940	experience a 50-year marriage even in witnessing it like I don't I don't like like I think that
3453940	3459380	our society has has all too readily accepted the idea that you well you get three divorces in your
3459380	3466260	life like yeah what's wrong with these people I got divorced uh sorry I just feel I'll figure
3466260	3473780	I'll be dead before I hit 50 yeah yeah I don't I married like 13 years ago so I'm not gonna make
3473780	3481300	it to 50 my greenhouse effect right yeah exactly yeah you know something I got really freaked out
3481300	3489140	about so have you heard of these life pods Donna uh uh the tree this is a new thing like when you
3489140	3494980	talk about how you want to be you know dealt with in your passing there's the coffin and the ground
3494980	3499700	and then there's the cremation and then there's uh I don't know mausoleums in Europe or something
3499700	3503940	I don't know or there's like uh I think they can dangle you from a zeppelin and just fly you
3505380	3512500	that's not a thing no it's not a thing I but go to my go fund me and uh don't go to that
3513540	3517700	but they have these things called life pods now my girlfriend was showing me they look like giant
3517780	3524580	potatoes like potatoes that you could fit a person in because you do put a person in them and then
3524580	3529140	bury them underground so that a tree can suck on them and and so it's like it's like it's like
3529140	3534420	standard burial but it's just what's more I think that's beautiful but I posted that on Kate's
3534420	3541620	Facebook page and just said FYI uh but I want to I want to put Cody and Cody and I want to be in
3541620	3548100	the same one yeah so that means if I get hit by a bus I have to be frozen until she dies and then
3549220	3554660	so we got to work up the paperwork for that it's a lot of that's a lot of uh legal yeah paperwork
3554660	3558820	there should be a window it's like writer's guild with streaming rights it's like there should be
3558820	3562820	there should just be like a three well that's a lot of that's three years and then you start
3562820	3570500	dating then you can we'll bury his body in his own life pod but uh the the uh but the the thing
3570580	3574580	that started to panic me because I really thought about it was okay what if six thousand years from
3574580	3583060	now aliens come to earth and they're like oh we found a planet where people lived and evolved
3583060	3589940	an ascension life and they when they died they'd bury themselves or each other uh they didn't know
3589940	3597860	about this ray and then everybody who has bones in a box six feet underground in these clearly
3597860	3604900	marked areas like they all get to go hey I'm my name's Fred Johnson I'm I fought World War II
3604900	3611300	and it's good to be in the year 8009 yeah that's in uh but my dumb ass because I was such a hippie
3611300	3619140	and had my shit scattered in joshua tree I'm the only one at the party oh wow I'm just I just
3619140	3624420	fuddly I'm terrified now and that explains pyramids like you can imagine them they lived
3624420	3629140	till 17 and like some of them were gods and they were like yeah built me a pyramid like they
3629140	3634260	really thought there was a chance like I'm gonna come back put yeah put my dogs and servants in
3634260	3640260	there yeah uh what do they have to do to the servants to convince them like hey why don't you
3640260	3649300	go oh I forgot something in there I'll get it no no no no it's kind of smart because the servants
3649380	3655700	were always trying to keep them alive yeah right like what after they died no yeah
3657460	3661860	well I always imagine that the food tasters are real like serious like right hand man and
3661860	3665460	their king because I mean that guy can't be screwing around with his like eating right
3665460	3670900	like like the the emperor is going to need like the food taster especially in the afterlife
3670900	3674900	he doesn't know what's what it's going to look like a pot roast but where do you know that's
3674900	3680500	going to take yeah who knows yeah oh and then you mean in the afterlife there's an after poison
3680500	3685620	well no oh no exactly shrub me and shrub were kind of on the same page on this like the reason
3685620	3690340	you're going to yeah that's always a red flag that's a red flag it's a big red flag but I'm
3690340	3695620	going to go he was he poured cowboy boots and just with nothing else well enough another my
3696660	3700820	high school my high school had a had a dress code and he had to wear leather shoes and a shirt and
3700820	3706500	tie but I would wear a shirt and tie and I wear alligator cowboy boots that I got on bitcoin before
3706500	3714500	there was a bitcoin kind of thing going on you're the best long story short the reason you need a
3714500	3718820	poison tester in the normal life is the same reason you need a poison tester in the afterlife
3720100	3721620	I want to hear that whole story
3721620	3732660	okay sounds engaging and epic I was I was going to put a pin in that one because I wanted to ask
3732660	3738980	jonah do you think do you think like when you get an antidote the poison goes to heaven and that's
3738980	3745220	what you're talking about oh so like there's poison there's dead poison dead like a ghost poison
3745780	3749700	and then you can put that in your ghost it's poison with unfinished business right
3750660	3754820	so if you give it an or no I'm sorry that's that's ghost poison that's that's poison that's still
3754820	3760500	down here yeah that we just can't know we don't know that we're eating right right right I think
3760500	3767540	valiant poison that nailed it goes up to Valhalla where it's used to poison people sparingly on

3900740	3905540	it's in the shrub DNA yeah you gotta do what you gotta do you gotta do it do you think that
3905540	3911300	he was compliant with any of that or was he just a hapless victim no he was compliant
3913300	3917380	somewhere along the line were you were you sweet on her from afar
3920340	3925060	oh you notice how he had to think that the answer was sure
3926980	3933780	thank you that's how an old-school american gentleman speaks about yeah sure sure
3935540	3937060	anyway sorry to throw that in there i just
3938900	3944500	you're not as good as there's a ray of masculinity like emanating from rob shrub's dad that like
3944500	3950740	informs like a lot of like power invested in the yeah were you an admiral okay yeah
3951860	3958500	he has a regal presence for the command respect yeah but he you you were on you were on submarines
3958500	3964020	and stuff right yeah yeah that's better than being an admiral uh i think yeah
3966660	3972100	rick rick was that a famous admiral that was like yeah admiral rick over admiral rick over
3973060	3976580	well let's let's never get rick roe over on youtube
3979140	3984420	we're gonna check out the new avengers trailer and get rick over you just try to look at a
3984420	3992500	weather person's blunder and you get rick roevert over what was what was rick over's what was he
3992500	3998100	what was his crucial role he was really the father of the nuclear navy he first wanted to
3998100	4003780	give off the anomalous yep wow you so he was
4009620	4015780	did you know did you know him did you meet him in ceremonial circumstances
4015780	4027460	this is
4039060	4043620	but just sweep that under the rug we don't need to get a mic on that all right well there's only
4043620	4049860	so many mics so let's replace dave klein with with david shrub my pleasure absolutely david if
4049860	4057380	you'd be we'd be honored if you would come up and just uh thank you dave klein mr shrub the modern
4057380	4066580	definition of a gentleman sir thank you dave i'm sorry dad i'm so sorry
4066740	4074980	all right so you were just saying from your chair you served in the rick over administration
4074980	4078740	i know that that's not that's not those are the words you used your admiral when you were in the
4078740	4084660	navy was admiral rick over who i've never heard of but was a he you're saying he was like this
4084660	4089700	here's the steve jobs of the nuclear navy yeah exactly that would that would be a good good
4089700	4097220	analogy wow did you see that steve jobs movie uh not yet it's kind of rick over rick over was
4097220	4104420	a little bit of an sob wow very much so in fact he wanted things his way and if you gave him to
4104420	4111380	him his way maybe things worked more efficiently but maybe i don't know maybe he was he was pretty
4111380	4119460	much a non-military kind of guy he he uh he never wore his uniform really so he was more of a
4119460	4127620	zuckerberg type he'd just show up in pajamas you wear a hoodie just crocs in an ipod
4129300	4138420	um so what wait so in the navy this is the sound like my uh my ex-wife's father was a uh uh a
4138420	4145060	chaplain navy chaplain um and uh i didn't even really realize until i was talking to him that
4146260	4153540	what this you you were an enlisted man you signed up you were yes and and i never even knew this
4153540	4159780	about our military in all of the branches of the military there is a uncrossable line between
4159780	4165860	enlisted men and officers right you can't become you can go as high as a certain rank if you're
4166420	4167380	that's not correct okay
4172660	4179140	you can go all the way from semen to admiral if you are so inclined or your ability to let you do
4179140	4184020	that okay it's possible okay so maybe what he was expressing or maybe i shouldn't put words in his
4184020	4189380	mouth maybe i'll get a letter from him did you just got me fired from the military um i thought
4189380	4194340	it was like actually like no like like officers like it's almost sounded like a class system thing
4194340	4199780	like if you were born wealthier basically you go you you're like if you go to west point
4199780	4205540	it's like you maybe a maybe a 1919 or something like that but not not today is it maybe an army
4205540	4212900	thing instead of like a navy thing no marines thing this guy he's saying no way jose
4215140	4216820	between the two of you i believe it
4216820	4221860	sergeant major in the marines if you didn't go to college if you go to college then you
4221860	4229460	can go to general oh it's a college thing okay so okay well so you could if you go to sergeant
4229460	4233780	major so you can be you might be a general
4233780	4245780	so jeff foxworthy routine you know i feel like i haven't explained things here
4248500	4253700	so can you well just give us a little side of your story because because your your wife of course
4253700	4258660	she's going to glorify herself in this story how she likes she she set you in her crosshairs and
4258660	4264980	then six months later you were a husband yeah prove that you're the real hero okay that was
4264980	4271620	pretty much it did you did you did you feel like like the the push did you like like this this
4271620	4277300	ladies i was pretty willing participant yeah you were fine whether you were like this this
4278020	4282900	this goddess is coming into my world and okay that's that's my new religion like like that's
4282900	4291060	uh i yeah okay i uh 50 years man boy oh boy no kidding well what okay so give us some pointers
4291060	4294820	because we live in this sewage where we're all watching porn together and uh
4296660	4300420	everything's pierced and tattooed and we're not watching it together
4302820	4308740	i've never watched porn anybody talking about him and his girlfriend mom and dad oh okay sorry
4308820	4315300	go ahead but also what what were you saying what were you saying um i'm saying like we live
4315300	4323460	at a bob king stuff but the royal we we live in it we live in a society where the the the boundaries
4323460	4329780	have been eroded they've been taken down and in so many ways that was an important thing to happen
4329780	4335940	because those boundaries were protecting bad things happening to good people um we needed we
4335940	4343620	needed to like kind of lower uh the compartments uh so that everybody was all mixed together and
4343620	4350660	that what was once considered only for behind closed doors conversation started to move onto
4350660	4356500	the television and then onto the into everyday conversation uh along the way i think one of the
4356500	4361300	things we've definitely lost and i don't know if it's for better or for worse is that the the the
4361860	4367060	it's the lifelong marriage is like it's we don't so i don't i'm almost i'm just i guess what i'm
4367060	4372820	asking is if we could without changing too much about the direction we're moving in because
4372820	4378980	we all we all need to keep evolving and and being more chaotic in our life but i think also a lot
4378980	4385300	of us would like to think they could be in a partnership that lasted as long you know for
4385300	4390740	50 years or more are is there any little nugget like like like any little tip
4392020	4399380	like you guys are gonna say red candles uh yeah a little more red candles maybe
4400340	4404420	did you guys ever have you ever guys ever been to couples therapy have you ever had to do any
4404420	4413060	maintenance do you know about that that's a thing now yeah well don't need it so what did you how
4413060	4419860	did you guys i mean what's the what's the secret what's the secret i love them the same as i did the
4419860	4427380	first day we got married there you have it it's kind of a frustrating answer but
4430020	4434820	we'd like to know the secret and you're obviously just telling us we're the best and we're like we
4434820	4442020	know what's the secret and he's my best friend and he's my best friend and we talk things over
4442900	4446260	and there's that there's and he he's the calm one and i'm the
4447140	4453540	worrier so it's a balance yeah so then so that so that somebody's got to do the worrying in the
4453540	4458820	family the the military man the guy that you saw in a uniform and said he's going to be my husband
4458820	4464660	he's the one that actually brings the don't worry about it as much uh energy like he's very calm you
4464660	4469140	find yourself fretting more and then he says uh don't worry about it that much yeah just let it
4469220	4475700	go all right he was sleeping in a submarine powered by nuclear yeah yeah power yeah that
4475700	4482100	makes sense like he's like listen this isn't a big deal yeah you can use it you can have the remote
4486420	4493700	have you seen dash boot uh how dangerous like when when you were in the submarine like how
4493700	4503140	deep were you oh i've asked that let him answer like how how 400 feet or more 400 feet 10 years
4503140	4507060	and like do you see any boogens or anything
4510180	4514820	military no you don't see anything there's like six inches of steel between okay there's no windows
4514820	4522420	there's no windows and no screen doors okay all right okay all right settle down settle down
4522420	4527540	did you do you have to say 400 feet or more because someone once told you you're that that
4527540	4532980	you can't say that's good that's the secret and so it could have been as much as 2400 feet and
4532980	4538740	you saw the Loch Ness Monster and didn't battle with it and i wouldn't tell you you can neither
4540180	4546340	he couldn't even tell me yeah you know i'd say how deep did you go pretty deep to where
4546420	4553620	how pretty how far did you go classified pretty far but it is it is classified you're sworn to
4553620	4559060	secrecy right even 10 years after he's out well 10 years well how long you been out yeah
4563060	4569780	oh boy it's like 50 years well let's spill let's talk what's up with area 51
4570020	4575380	was it was it was it was it Sarah Palin who said they could see Russia from her backyard
4575380	4580340	yeah i could see it through the periscope yeah i was i was gonna make the joke you were just off
4580340	4587220	the coast of Nova Scotia they were no not really uh yeah you were you were you were you were in a
4587220	4594820	submarine whose job was if the shit hit the fan to strike first if not second and harder like you
4594820	4601540	were parked off of our enemy and waiting to blow them up if you had to what was your day-to-day like
4602420	4604900	like there's a lot of cosplay
4609780	4614420	you make your own fun when you're in a steel tube 90 dudes
4614420	4624900	all right i'm sorry it's so unfair so unfair what was the day-to-day what it was it was pretty
4624900	4634100	routine yeah i bite yeah i mean that's uh that's probably a military priority yeah like the what
4634100	4640980	what was your post what was your station what was were you uh maneuvering uh we would operate the
4640980	4646740	reactor okay wait wow maneuvering and we would operate the reactor to me sounds like two different
4646740	4651860	things maneuvering sounds like it's the same place at the area the control room was called maneuvering
4652420	4658500	okay but but but the reactor you're talking about the nuclear reactor correct you would
4658500	4663140	operate the reactor yes how is that maneuvering and the reactors isn't it just a furnace that's
4663140	4669540	powering this thing you're not just shoveling nuclear material anyway you're not shoveling it
4670100	4676900	but uh that's what uh require it's required to maneuver to move is to is to like turn up and
4676900	4682180	down this thermostat on this nuclear plant not quite not quite a thermostat or something like
4683220	4687780	they shape it like a steering wheel to make you more comfortable but really it's a thermostat
4687780	4695940	how many how many people uh did that with you three three did did anybody go crazy down there
4696900	4704500	okay a couple wild cards down there no never had that happen no he had someone come aboard one
4704500	4710340	time we were short a person and they were going to volunteer for submarines so they didn't really
4711380	4716980	vet them very well i guess would be the word and we we never pulled away from decided to tender
4716980	4722660	before he said i can't take this that happens on deadliest catch every week you ever watch
4722980	4727220	there's always a green horn that is like i've watched this show on tv i'm going to be a great
4727220	4731620	crab fisherman and then they're like puking and they can't handle it they let me out of here
4732260	4739300	um yeah i can't even begin to wait what okay so uh were you in the shit no okay how long how long
4739300	4746900	would you be how long would you be uh in the submarine for like days week the longest yeah
4746980	4755700	120 day patrol 120 days man uh you guys have it so easy
4757700	4765700	and were you so i assume that if you would you so you were parked somewhere strategically
4766580	4771460	and then after that 120 days that's when another sub would come and relieve you kind of tap you
4771460	4776340	out and it would take this thing something something like that we weren't really parked we
4776340	4784980	had a maybe a little course maybe a 100 mile 100 square mile area where we would be in somewhere
4784980	4790100	there was never any moment when most of the equipment failed and there was another one out
4790100	4797940	there and it was like listen listen listen turn off all the turn off all the fans the fans are
4797940	4804340	making noise but if we turn off the fans we won't be able to shut up and bubble up bubble up to
4804340	4810820	10 that bubble only goes to nine to 10 i said there was there was never these submarine dramas
4810820	4817060	there's like nine good ones do you watch them or do you feel traumatized at all when you watch
4817060	4824980	dust boot when you watch uh no no dust boot was a good representation was that the best one was
4825060	4828340	that the was it that area it was one of the best ones was it that really that
4828980	4834260	go with like bolts flying out like a water sprigger you know you've got to remember i was in
4834900	4840900	mostly peacetime right cold war but it was a little different don't we all miss it so much
4842340	4847060	just when our enemy for 50 years was other white guys with a backwards alphabet so simple
4850020	4854020	and we all just had an agreement let's just make james bod movies and hang out
4855860	4861060	the kids cartoons will have like natasha like like like fem fatale like like you know
4861060	4866580	bull so great we're doing nuclear drill every once in a while and now it's just like hello
4868100	4874020	happy thanksgiving i'm a crazy person with a completely i'm taking a turkey carving knife
4874020	4880180	and i'm doing this uh and we're all we don't know what we're doing uh sorry i i i i just envy that
4880180	4887380	so much like the we envy the cold war yeah because it was nice and cold yeah i think war
4887380	4895140	is best served cold well we we and you can see us trying to recreate that like since 9 11 that
4895140	4902420	we're trying desperately a new generation that's the has inherited um this an empire that was
4902420	4907780	really forged by kind of wizards you know guys smoking cigarettes and doing nothing but thinking
4907780	4912260	in the basement of the pentagon about how do we get into world war ii and what are we going to do
4912260	4916260	when we get into that and how are we going to turn that into america running the show and they and
4916260	4923460	they nailed it um and and then that plan which was 50 years long kind of ran out right around
4923460	4929220	that fateful day and we're all living in this weird epilogue where it's more open source now
4929220	4935060	we're all watching each other lie and scramble to try to recreate the glory days you can see us
4935060	4940660	trying to oh oh isis is it going to be isis okay okay great great so isis oh so isis we can
4940660	4944740	bang on that and you're getting your good light put the turban on and just like be isis can you
4944740	4949300	be isis for 50 years okay nailed it great okay that's going to move twinkies uh
4952340	4958020	but but they're not playing ball you know they're not that's not going to happen uh i i don't know
4958020	4966820	why why what my point is let's let's uh let's move on um how many people were on board your sub

5169300	5175940	it it's cutting edge and at one point rob was at my parents house in the suburbs of milwaukee and
5175940	5181380	and we were so accustomed to doing this thing and then like like my dad is a nice guy and
5181380	5187780	liked rob and sitting at a counter the bordering the living room in the kitchen and i was in the
5187780	5192100	kitchen and rob you know what a butcher block is that the thing that's a butcher the island
5192100	5199780	of the kitchen i am i don't rob bent me over the kitchen island i'm listening started miming uh
5199780	5210260	making making love to me um you know i had an opening and i had to go for it
5211380	5216660	because you knew his dad would get it yeah you're like and and i'm only getting one chance to do
5216660	5225060	this and he pulled and he pulled my hair and lifted my head and said look at your father
5232420	5235060	look at your father while i fuck you in the ass
5235060	5250900	and my dad was like eating eating pistachios on a on a paper towel by the phone by the landline
5250900	5263540	and was like my dad was like he thought it was funny but he was so confused as to when did this
5263540	5272340	become okay am i supposed to do something they're they're 20 i never i never really realized i
5272340	5277620	realized till now like how lucky i was that you never did that you had every right to do that to

5308100	5314020	like i feel like our relationship would have been different from then on yeah i can i get along with
5314020	5320340	my parents now well i always got along with my parents because i tried just to get along
5321220	5327060	but lately a couple years ago i was like no i'm gonna consciously like it's me i know it's not

5422900	5431060	they all go to breakfast you can see the people yeah it's like a line of ants yeah and uh and um
5431060	5441060	it's uh it's fucking crazy they're it's the largest recorded the largest recorded hpv
5441060	5450020	outbreak happened there because because you know do you remember that movie with uh matt dillon's
5450020	5455540	first movie what was that like with the teenagers it was about a um flubingo kid drugstore cowboy
5455540	5461460	oh come on the bodyguard nope it was i know what you know what i'm talking about i forgot the name
5461460	5468820	what's it called no no before that rumble fish no no no no cheap trick did the soundtrack cheap
5468820	5473940	trick it's called cheap trick no no no that was just a soundtrack it was uh but anyway it was a
5473940	5483700	movie about um uh uh planned communities kids kids taking over yeah and and and that the first
5483700	5490180	for the first time and this happened in the 70s like communities there were planned communities
5490180	5495540	60s and 70s and for the first time ever there was a dense population of teenagers
5496420	5503060	and when teenagers over the edge to get over the edge they get together and they commit no
5503060	5513780	bottom of the streets over the edge what terminator two the movie's called over the edge
5513780	5520340	movies called it's called matt dillon's first movie and uh and they when when a lot when
5520340	5528020	i concentrated as kevin edge when a concentrated group of teens get together they commit crimes
5528180	5533140	like they just go crazy well like in our neighborhood we just throw rocks at cars
5535380	5541060	they take acid because that was a new thing and they throw rocks at cars but they
5542020	5546020	this is all to say this is a uh the fun movie
5549300	5554180	what's the name of it over the edge it is oh it might be over there with christie mcnichol
5554820	5558580	i think i don't know if she's in it i think christie mcnichol might be in it too
5558580	5563700	but when you get uh they chain the chain like all like the parents and the adults inside the
5563700	5568340	high school and then they no no no no that's like a direct video kickboxing i don't even know
5568340	5574580	who i'm gonna tell the end of this story because it's it was great before i belabored the whole
5574580	5582100	fucking thing uh anyway they got for the first time this amount of old people together in this
5582100	5589140	concentrated a population and all they do is fuck because old people fucking teenagers uh
5589140	5600580	do crimes that's my point that's my stance but but do old people do they do it extramaritaly
5600580	5606900	yeah i think so i think they're all swingers i think they all um there's an orgy club or something
5607620	5610900	well i don't think the shrub that's why the shrubs aren't moving to florida you guys have

5920820	5926580	they arrested him impounded his vehicle took him to the station let him out and he had to like get
5926580	5932340	a ride home he doesn't have his car so he doesn't have his job and uh so his car is impounded and
5932340	5938100	he can't make money to pay to get it out of impounded so uh i i'm set up a go fund me for
5938100	5944340	him um it's gofundme.com slash help obed it's it's not too much money we're just trying to get
5944340	5948900	him so he can pay his rent because he can't pay his rent because he can't you know work that's
5948900	5953140	insane so it's 30 days because it sounds like are they shaking down is this this must be is
5953140	5956980	yeah i don't think this is some kind of la municipal it was in van ny's so i don't know
5956980	5965540	i mean van ny's might be less busy than real la but i don't know yeah what's that that's the thing
5966180	5970580	i mean it seems like a really effective one i mean it's like if you were trying to shut down uber
5970580	5975460	then you just impounding cars for 30 days at a time because it doesn't matter you don't you
5975460	5979940	don't get to go to court and go i was guilty or innocent your car is just out of commission for
5979940	5984260	30 days yeah i mean i'm not a lawyer but that's straight up entrapment if that's yeah that's
5984260	5989140	fucking it isn't not not stopping for a person flagging down your car is called being a dick
5989220	5994740	yeah like like like what what how is it if that's if that's really how it went down which
5995460	5999780	it took me a long time to really get the details out but i think that's back because you were
5999780	6006100	talking to obit yeah uh yeah we've had obit on the show before is this a real obit yeah real obit
6006100	6010180	one of my friends another one of my friends although he brought everyone so much joy in the
6010180	6015300	place i always want to point out you know i do think that the character i created is more
6015300	6021780	dimensional yeah yeah i think that calling obit real obit is an insult i don't have a lot to base
6021780	6027140	to my work but i trust you i trust what you feel like i feel like what i did is the real obit like
6027140	6032980	like like this is a guy named so the original obit yeah for your first first obit he's the
6032980	6040180	name that i got yeah the name from this dude yeah uh but uh yeah he's a he's a good guy and we
6040420	6046980	love him and uh he's that's a bomb i'm relieved that he's not currently in jail yeah i uh yeah
6046980	6051380	how long was he in jail for i don't think he was i think he got arrested and they took him to the
6051380	6056180	station and then they let him go i don't know like handcuffs and everything i think they put him in
6056180	6059940	the back of the car i don't know if they put him in handcuffs in the back of the uber or in the back
6059940	6066180	of the car no they would that'd be weird yeah drive to the impound lot we'll follow you yeah
6067140	6074340	as we all know in the los angeles area typically if you flag down a cop car you get shot in the
6074340	6080500	eyeball the face um yeah and still survive speaking of go fund me i i haven't i you know
6080500	6086900	i was passionate about that for for my attention span but uh there's a guy that across the street
6086900	6092260	from shrub's apartment no in front of my apartment yeah he saw it weird distinction to
6092820	6101620	uh across the street you are connected with it no no no there was this guy that was walking
6101620	6107060	down the street during like prime to unloss feelers yeah and he uh flagged down a cop
6108260	6113700	he had like a towel around his hand and he flagged down the cop car and they pulled over
6113700	6118100	and they got out because he goes walking every day according to his son takes a towel and a bottle
6118100	6124740	of water no shirt broad daylight los felas this is a guy who he's just walking a middle-aged guy
6124740	6129460	just like this is what he does he goes walking what he does so he's done for 30 years unfortunately
6129460	6136420	the the story the story the you know the true the true side of the story that you need is locked in
6136420	6141780	the brains that end up getting blown out because the other the other the other side is up to lawyers
6141780	6146740	and the city police get out of the car and then they drop the gun drop the gun and he's like i
6146740	6150900	don't know and he didn't have what would you do if you were holding a towel and cops kept saying
6150900	6157220	drop your gun drop the gun you would you would probably i don't think i would drop my towel yeah
6157220	6163460	i think there's a good chance i would go it's a towel and they shot him they shot him in the eye
6163460	6172100	and and and he didn't die but they and then they handcuffed him which i guess is police procedure
6172100	6178660	yeah but you know like it's they just rolled his bloody it was awful it's awful but it happened
6178660	6182900	like right outside my house like kate and i were like hanging out in the in the living room where
6182900	6186500	you hear pop pop pop and i was like somebody just got shot and looked outside and there's
6187140	6192660	everything yeah there's a million videos of his lifeless body being handcuffed there's no videos
6192660	6197460	of the incident even though it happened in rush hour traffic because it just happened that that
6197460	6204580	fast yeah the the the problem is like like well the way that the city handles this stuff
6204580	6210660	like something like this happens and then this guy's wife she has to quit her job like like like
6210660	6215940	like he like we don't we pretend like it's not like it's not like a game show where all of a
6215940	6220180	sudden you're elevated to a different part of life like their ordinary life has to continue
6220180	6224020	and everyone's just like yeah we shot your husband in the eye and then it was we're the cut to the
6224020	6227460	two cops that did it are going back to work of course they were they're getting evicted too
6227460	6231140	because they can't afford to pay rent she had to quit her full-time job because she has to take
6231140	6236820	care of her husband who a quarter of his head is while they're dealing um and and and so there's
6236820	6242740	just a go fund me for them because it's like well we can't make our rent it's not about justice it's
6242740	6248580	not about outrage it's about like well now we're gonna be homeless too because we got shot in the
6248580	6255140	eye by the cops we're going to also then as a as a matter of course be evicted from our apartment
6255140	6260900	and that's the point where it gets it's it's it's it's insane so which i i think crowdfunding if
6260900	6265220	there's one thing we can do and i always said when i was tweeting that link i was like if you
6265220	6271940	live in los angeles and particularly if you work for the city um because maybe you know let's have
6271940	6276820	a stake in this but i don't but you know people from ireland and give a dollar to a guy it's
6276820	6281140	like like well there must be fucked up stuff going on in ireland i don't know what my point
6281140	6286260	is i i like like i know that there's suffering happening all over the place but there's a there's
6286260	6291380	the two go fund me's on my radar are the guy who got his brain shot out in front of rob's apartment
6291380	6295860	whose wife is about to be homeless because it's hard to take care of a person with a quarter of
6295860	6302260	a brain and also work at shoni's uh like like wherever wherever she worked she she worked at
6302260	6309780	nasa dan don't be an asshole um whatever whatever her job was uh i'm sure it was 12 hours a day and
6309780	6313700	like like like then she had to quit it and they just so it's just like a certain amount of money
6313700	6318580	they need so they can continue to live in their apartment and this is abbott now who got entrapped
6318580	6324020	obviously entrapped unless he's a pathological liar which i don't think he is he got flagged
6324020	6329380	down by a cop and they yeah but they confiscated his car and now he can't make a living uh the
6329460	6333460	other one is just uh holocaust survivors but you know whatever put that on the back burner
6335860	6341060	does he have his car back no no it's it's impounded and he can't even get it like it's
6341060	6346260	gonna take a try for 30 days oh my gosh how much how much does it cost to get it impounded uh
6346820	6353380	i don't know they they won't tell you the exact repounded rebounded yes we made an estimate but
6353380	6357300	uh they won't tell you the exact price but they'll tell you what they think it'll be over the phone
6357300	6362500	but you can't they won't tell you until 30 days pass and they because they charge you for the toe
6362500	6367460	and then for the storing the whole time they charge you for storing hey we're not made out
6367460	6373620	of space over here at the impound lot where you can't get your car out you you're putting us out
6374660	6380980	if i wish i could whistle i think 30 days you made us keep this car in here if you ever get
6380980	6390340	approached by a policeman just lay down on the ground and spread your limbs out as wide as you
6390340	6396980	can and just say i don't have anything in my hands i don't have anything in my hands i mean
6396980	6402100	that's what what you're describing is what we found out in this recent rash this last year it's like
6402100	6406420	like culturally what's come to the surface is that this is something that black parents actually
6406420	6411620	have to say to their kids they have they have to have the cop talk with their kids talk the cop
6411620	6417940	talk where we're no regardless of their of their tax bracket regardless yeah no no no if a cop
6417940	6423380	ever has an encounter with you because it's like i don't care what you see on tv where a cop but
6423380	6428100	i don't care what you believe about society a parent has to sit on the foot of the bed of a kid
6428100	6435860	and say you need to fucking comply beyond all reasoning in your head of what's fair
6435860	6441540	shit you gotta sit on the foot of your bed foot of their bed and talk to them about there's so
6441540	6447220	many things already there's a whole list can you imagine being that kid though like being the kid
6447220	6452340	who's like you know it's like i've been growing up just as a normal person it's like oh i gotta
6452340	6457940	be afraid of the cops like as a small child like it's gotta like just fuck with you it's like these
6457940	6462740	people that are supposed to protect me you know it's like they might hurt me that's kind of like
6462740	6468500	really kind of put you in kind of like a like a like a real stressful high anxiety because
6468500	6472260	that's how i feel about cops is that they're probably going to kill me and that's completely
6472260	6477220	unfounded like because i'm just walking around you know but uh it's just the idea that you'd
6477220	6484020	have to think about that like just from being a small child is just so heartbreaking to me yeah
6484020	6489540	yeah and by the way the la pd i uh in general as far as i understand it since the rodney king
6489540	6494900	thing like you'd notice like i i i'm curious about the statistics but because you don't hear
6494900	6499300	the good news especially when the good news is lack of brutality because there's nothing to report
6499300	6504980	there but it's as far as i understand the la pd was taken over by the department of justice it's
6504980	6511300	still like being babysat by a weird bureaucratic commission that's out of any satire you'd write
6511300	6517300	about political correctness but is functioning actually kind of okay minus the odd guy getting
6517380	6522900	shot in the eyeball um that there isn't you know like that it's way more fucked up in a lot of
6522900	6529380	other cities that we're discovering this entrenched crazy like like you're lifting up rocks and there's
6529380	6536100	just like worms crawling out you're like holy crap like the la pd is like very as but but correct me
6536100	6540500	if i'm wrong you know tweet me and you know and show me articles and things because i'm that i'm
6540500	6546980	too lazy to read but but but but that's my perception is the is the actually it's unreportably
6546980	6553860	positive that we're kind of like we're not in the headlines yeah for the last 15 years city we're
6553860	6562180	such an it's a very new city um i love the movie la confidential because well i don't know because
6562180	6570020	it's fucking awesome but uh but also it's like shows us this cross section of of the la pd at
6570020	6578980	that time and it uh it seems systemically like they've just they were always they were built on
6578980	6588180	this corruption and then yeah recently like it it's they it's i'm drunk i'm a little drunk
6588180	6592820	is that like right around the time of the rat you don't think there was this rampart scandal it
6592820	6599060	was like they created this anti-gang task force in the rampart neighborhood los angeles because
6599060	6605060	it was such a heavy gang activity and that that was a it was just it was an eye opener because the
6605060	6613380	rampart anti anti-gang like squad became just another gang and they literally would go they
6613380	6617620	would i don't know if they would literally did drive-bys because they didn't have to drive-bys
6617700	6622420	are a thing you do because there's cops if you're a cop you get out you handcuff a guy get him on his
6622420	6626100	knees and they were assassinating people like like they were they were like handcuffing them
6626100	6630980	and then killing them because they were simply another gang that had a different outfit and a
6630980	6637300	different kind of car and and and had a different like like like what kind of car uh one with the
6637300	6643460	flashlight yeah we're rocking uh but that shit all got you know the la pd currently as far as i
6643460	6648260	understand it exists in a kind of very very modern open source bureaucratic yeah but like you said
6648260	6656340	like it it's just having to grow from that origin you know like that they're they're having a
6657060	6662180	it's like a whole new thing hopefully i don't know anything about it who knows we're not the
6662180	6670020	worst but you know we could do a lot better who's the worst uh ohio yeah fuck those guys
