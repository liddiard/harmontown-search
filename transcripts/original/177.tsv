0	15520	Alright. That was chosen at random. Ladies and gentlemen, buckle your holy shit belts.
15520	20880	From the Nerd Belt Theater in Hollywood, California, Hermonetown is now in session!
20880	37040	From the deepest, darkest mists of my imagination, and all the concentration I can conjure,
37040	53200	is there a Spencer Crittenden among us. Spencer Crittenden to the stage.
53200	55360	You got your shorts back on. Oh yeah.
55360	57960	I heard about your pants last week and I was alarmed.
57960	62080	Oh, everyone was, everyone was. How you doing Spencer?
62080	67360	I'm so good. That means he's high!
67360	71920	Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of Hermonetown, Mr. Dan Hermon.
79600	80100	Yo.
82800	91360	Beat. Beat to the street. Street. Everyone two feet. Two feet. Walk two feet. Walk on the street.
92080	94000	Beat to the beat. Whoa. Hey.
98880	108480	Sorry. Beat to the street. Two feet. What the fuck? What the fuck? Two feet? Beat to the street.
108480	112880	Street. Beat. The king of the street. You can see him walking two feet from across the street.
113760	118480	Street feet is a lesson too because you can't let the two feet beat you.
118480	125040	Street. Beat. Beat. Meat. You have the beat with your feet. That's not, don't listen to him.
127120	135040	Okay, all right. Sorry about that. I didn't know that. I didn't know we had beef.
136640	140640	Oh Dan, our fucking street beef has gone on for too long.
140640	143440	Street beef. The beef. You see him rocking that?
143680	147200	Beat black on the street to the beef. I mean, don't let the beef street you.
149040	154160	Dan Hermon, you as the Mayor, you walked out and you said, keep that beat going. Keep that beat
154160	159680	going. The problem was there was only 30 seconds left of that beat. So you, your solution was to
159680	164320	to hit the pedal to the middle. Do you want to, do you want to go back to that beat?
165360	170000	No, no. Give me a different beat. You sure? Yeah.
170000	178080	Yeah. Give me a good one. A slow one. Yeah. Same beat. Yeah. Same beat. Same beat.
178880	186240	Yeah. Same beat. Yeah. Yeah. Same beat. Culture. Christmas. Street. Rhythm.
190160	193600	You have a, you have one, that's not part of the rap. That's me. You have one,
193600	198880	one minute 40 left. You want to start from the top? Ignoring that. No, ignoring that.
200720	211520	Two minutes. Street beef. Streets. Street. Street. Street beef. Every street has a beat to its
211520	218480	street. Every street has one or two feet. Every street walks along its own street. It seems like
218480	224480	a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a contradiction. How can you walk on yourself? The answer is, oh.
224480	230960	Street beef. Yeah. You gotta ask yourself, how can you walk on yourself? Street beef. Street
230960	235760	beats on the street. Street beef. My name is Street Beats. I'm on the street beats. Professor
235760	242320	Street Beats going to the beats. I got one, two, one, left, right. I went down to the street today
242320	248640	and I saw your mama and I said, hey. And she said, oh, do you want a newspaper? And I said, no,
248640	254880	because of the internet. Okay. All right. That's good. You have a minute and five left.

303520	308560	our friend. Heather. Hello, Heather. Heather. Good to see you. Heather, uh, name or say a word

338000	344160	other shore. I'm going to go over to her and say, hey, you want more of my duck penis?
345840	348320	She's like no. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
348320	350160	and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and then we're into a whole
350160	360960	thing and, but migrating, migrating. Duck leader flies to the sky. It's time to fly south and we
360960	366240	don't know why because our brains are the size of peas, but where they're developed over six
366240	371520	million years and we've got magnets in our ears and that's it. Like it makes us fly and they're
371520	382480	like truly intricate, like patterns that even humans marvel at. Yo. Yeah. I think rhyming is
382480	396640	overrated. Yeah. All right. Thank you everybody. Jeff Davis. I was here to help the fucking set
396640	404240	you up below people's mind. You see Dan, people only pay $5 to watch you make that face. Most
404240	407600	people listen for free and they don't know that you're making a face. No, you did a great job.
407600	413280	You're a really good friend. So you're listening. He's giving two thumbs up.
416880	421520	Wait, he just gave three thumbs up. One's his dick.
421520	429120	Uh, obviously tonight's one of those nights when we're all a little, probably a little drunk.
429120	434720	I'm fucking sober as a judge. All right. All right. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be the noble one and admit
434720	441600	that I got a little drunk today. Yeah. Thank you kid. Thank you. You really think it's so glamorous
441600	447520	and then I'll see you in fucking hell. All right. Here's what I got. Everything's about,
447520	452960	everything's about fucking and porn and stuff on my notes. Uh, when you say it's about fucking
452960	456720	and porn, is it just porn on your notes or? I don't know. It's just all about dicks and balls and
456720	462000	stuff or those things relating to it. So, so, so, but like, like last week we had the young lady come
462000	466880	up and she tried to explain Tinder to me and Rob and uh, I thought, but I was, and I was talking
466880	471360	about cause I was like still, oh, she didn't feel like she tried to explain Tinder and she did say
471440	477280	that. I think the most like interesting thing that she said, um, was like, because I'll never
477280	482320	understand Tinder. I've, I've, I haven't installed it and like used it, but I thought I was thinking
482320	488160	and I wrote it down and did like the most important thing was that Tinder was an offshoot of grinder,
488160	495520	which grinder was like gay dudes going like, who wants to fuck a butt or suck a nut or it doesn't
495520	502320	have to rhyme when you're gay. It doesn't, I said, okay, we're going to play it. Okay. Yo, yo, yo,
503360	510960	grinder, MC grinder. I'm equal to everyone and you've chased me to the shadows. You get what you
510960	520800	deserve. Yo, yo, my IQ is 200. I have disposable income. I'm a good person. I deserve to have the
520800	528560	right to be married and you underestimate me. Fuck you. MC grinder. Fucking butts. MC grinder.
528560	539040	Licking nuts. MC grinder. What is butts? MC grinder. Okay. All right. That doesn't,
539840	543760	I'm a big fan of the game. I'll tell the, I'll tell you, uh, meltdown audience. Uh,
543760	551360	we haven't heard the last of MC grinder tonight. He will certainly be repressed at some point.
552960	561120	There will be gay MCs emailing in going like, that's not fair. You're making me say being gay
561120	566720	makes you a bad rapper. I say to all, I say to all of our gay MC listeners out there,
566720	572000	I challenge you to come down to meltdown comics. That would be amazing. And just have a gay MC
572000	579040	grinder rap. If you're a gay MC, well, obviously you should just come down no matter what. I don't,
579040	584960	I don't want to pit them against each other. No, no. Them against you. It's you. Yeah.
584960	589040	Is there a way I could just be a bad guy? Could I just be like sis, sis rapper?
590480	596640	Like, like straight, straight heteronormative rapper. MC heteronormative. Yo, everyone should
596640	604080	fit in a dichotomy. Oh, your pleasure needs a lobotomy. Oh, I'm, I'm the mainstream Jim
604080	610720	Belushi. I'm fat 45 year old piece of shit. Do we have another guy comes up. Whoa. Yo,
610720	616640	state the name. My name's MC grinder and I'm here to say, and he's like, he rocks the world or she.
619760	624000	Is grinder only men? You close my name. Is grinder only gay males? Is it gay? Is it gay
624000	628560	women too? Of course it's gay women. I don't fucking know. Are you trying to rub?
629680	638400	Of course it's gay women too. I do. It's what? Oh, you're all racist.
641280	645440	No, I meant the gay rap battles for women too. I don't know what grinder is for. I don't know.
645440	652320	Is there a woman, a homosexual grinder? Scissors? Are you joking?
652320	658240	It's scissor without an O. It's a scissor. Scissor. Scissor. And the slogan is it doesn't exist.
660160	668960	It's not real. It's a myth. There are several, uh, gay women, uh, apps. Datch. What does Datch
668960	673600	mean? It's a lesbian dating app, but it, I don't know, it wasn't successful for me. It wasn't
673600	678000	successful for you. Datch didn't work for you? Why? You met the wrong kind of people or what?
678960	685920	You didn't meet anybody. It's easier to swipe on Tinder and figure out who's queer.
686880	695360	All right. All right. You guys go away. I have a conversation with Heather, who you remember,
695360	700400	is in the front row. She's like, it's easier to use Tinder and try to figure out who's gay.
700400	704560	Heather, was he either made the awesome comic strip? Who's that? Who was the person that made
704560	719120	the awesome comic? Okay. All right. Okay. Rob Schwab to the stage. Bring him out. No,
719120	730960	get him out here. Rob, the phantom of the opera is here. Bring him out. Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Schwab.
734560	747920	What's up, Rob?
747920	761280	Let's make it a drink. Make it fak-
761280	772240	This guy likes ice. It's a lot of ice.
776320	777680	All right. I'm sorry.
781120	783520	Rob, what was your comic, what was your comic book called?
784240	784880	Fuck you.
788960	798800	All right. Who in the crowd sit there for the cameras?
798800	801440	Right there. Is that good, Chris? All right.
804160	807280	We went a nice two shot of you guys. Give me a good two shot.
807280	818800	You guys are familiar with a male porn performer named Nick Manning. His catchphrase is dropping
818800	827680	loads. It's a man who, when he comes, he says dropping loads. He says it out loud. He goes,
827680	833360	dropping loads, dropping loads. He says, I'm not the first person to this party. He's been
833360	838880	on stern and stuff. He was in a Batman parody where he said dropping bat load.
841120	851360	It's obviously like, because I was like, who's the dropping loads guy? I was looking for his
851360	857120	videos. He's in a million videos, but- You were looking for his videos in particular?
857120	861200	Yeah. I type his name in to- Because you like watching the guys say dropping loads while
861200	863840	they're coming? I wanted to check up on him and see if he was-
866000	873840	I didn't see a problem. His most recent videos, he maintains this caveman persona. He goes like,
875440	879200	he no longer says dropping loads. This is the fascinating thing to me.
879200	884400	Now you got to pay him. I think he signed a contract. I haven't dug deep, but I clicked
884400	888720	on the first three videos and it's just him going like, he grabs a woman and goes like,
889520	898880	sex. And then she starts thinking, he goes, dick and mouth. He's basically a cookie monster.
901120	904720	But you're into this guy? Am I into this guy?
905520	910400	You're searching his videos in particular. Is America into FDR? I don't know. I mean,
911120	917680	he dropped the loads of socialism on a country that needed it when it needed it.
918560	924560	You enjoy that porn? The Golden Gate Bridge exists because of loads dropped at the right time.
924560	930320	I don't know. Am I into it? I don't know. Are you into Jellinger? Are you into Ben Franklin?
930320	936080	Are you into Kitty Hawk? Are you into fucking Skittles? Are you into apple pie?
937200	943520	This is the weirdest parade I've ever seen. Are you watching these? Are you clicking on
943520	947280	this guy's porn because it's sexy to you or because you like him as a personality?
947360	952080	I want to check in on him and I want to know. I want to watch him say dropping loads.
952080	958000	Okay. I bet you somebody's got a super cut. Of course, on YouTube, it's all audio. But the
958000	963840	thing is, so I want to see, why did he drop them? I don't want to just see the audio. I want to see
963840	971360	him say dropping loads and his dick. Instead of going to YouTube, but trivia and Rick and
971360	978560	Morty fans, like season two, there's a season two. The Zardoz, the thing that's floating in
978560	985840	the planet, it's going dropping loads. That's a Nick Manning reference. The Zardoz face is Nick
985840	994640	Manning. He doesn't say it anywhere, but he says these crazy things. He goes, oh, your pussy juice
994720	999760	is on my balls. Are you jerking off to this? You're watching him and he's going like,
1001840	1006400	he's like Lenny Bruce. It's like, you don't like porn. He doesn't like it. He's like,
1006400	1011920	porn is bullshit. I feel like he's screaming out. He's going, yeah, pussy juice is great.
1011920	1019920	And you're kind of like, so you are jerking off to this guy's porn. Whoa, why wouldn't I?
1019920	1030640	I'm there. It's porn. But you're clicking in. Grow up. You're typing in the name of a guy that
1030640	1034640	says dropping loads and I'm going to eat that pussy juice. You're already making him sound
1034640	1041120	dumber than he is. You're not going to take this seriously. You can just, you can just stand down
1041120	1045760	for a second. I'm just dropping loads. And you're jerking off. You go, okay, you weren't too far on
1045760	1050080	that one. Like you don't like it. I don't feel like you're receptive to this. I'm listening.
1051120	1054960	Let's start. I'm receptive to finding out what the fuck is going on. My whole list is about
1054960	1060160	just fucking like, it's just weird. Yeah, it's about, it's tonight's a blue show. We're working
1060160	1067520	blue. Cause I was, we were talking to Dino tonight. Dino was telling this story. Get ready to go
1067520	1073680	chartreuse. Dino has this, Dino has this classic story. That's green. And he's told a million
1073680	1079040	times. I know it's beyond blue. I'm pretty sure Dino's told this story on the podcast where
1079040	1087760	Dino's like, like he was in a hotel somewhere out of town and he ran into a trans. He knew
1088640	1096080	he or she and put a pin in your offense that because that's the point of the story is that
1096560	1107120	he saw a kind of prostitute kind of figure hanging outside a hotel that upon first sight of him said
1107120	1114480	like, hi, room 315. And he was like, okay. And then later on that night he went up to the room
1114480	1122160	and then this person who was presenting as a very attractive woman, but who had a wiener
1122160	1127760	and that Dino knew had a wiener when he, when he saw her. But like, what was like, I'm into
1127760	1132160	this. I'm going to go to this room. And he went to the room and then, and then like, he has this
1132160	1137440	sexual encounter with this person and he was, he was retelling the story tonight and I just thought
1137440	1141760	it was so funny because, because while he was saying, it was like, I don't know if it's like,
1141760	1148080	like a man or a woman and that triggered my like millennial, like, I was like, well, come on. You
1148080	1152880	have to like, what was, what were they presenting as? But it's so funny because Dino's the new Archie
1152880	1162240	bunker because all he, we're like riffing on if all in the family was made today. Meathead would
1162240	1167200	be the one going, Archie, come on. Are you telling me you spent the night with this person? You don't
1167200	1171440	know what they were presenting as, what pronoun they preferred? And Archie bunker would be going,
1172080	1178800	geez, Meathead, look, I sucked on the dick. I fucked the button. What does it matter? Jesus Christ.
1181600	1186240	It was just like the Gen X mentality because I was like, I don't know. I was a fucking dude.
1186240	1192400	It's a girl. It's like he was in the, I'm cheese. I fucking got the poop and the dick and I'm licking
1192400	1198960	the balls and I don't care what that's a clitoral pussy. What is this person? Yeah, geez, Meathead.
1198960	1206400	It's pretty funny to me that, that truly, cause I was like, we were riffing on that,
1206400	1211600	but it was like, that's, it actually is the case that today's Meathead watch the show all in the
1211600	1217520	family. I'm going to have this guy on the show, Norman Lear, who's like 903. You're going to
1217520	1223200	bring Norman Lear on the show? Well, I got an in. We could have him. We could have them tomorrow.
1223840	1229680	I could have him on a paper plate. Norman Lear, we've got a new pitch for you.
1231040	1239280	But all in the family, but all in the right now. All right. All right. Knock it off. Okay. Knocking
1239280	1243520	it off. All right. One more thing. And then I'm done with my, and then we're freewheeling.
1244480	1252320	The, the fly that wasn't freewheeling. That was not free. I'm trying to move forward post-divorce
1252320	1257440	into a new era where I'm going to dress. I'm going to, I want to wear all the same outfit
1257440	1262720	all the time. I learned this from a character called Seth Brundle in the Cronenberg's remake
1262720	1269520	of the fly. You tried this a long time ago. You, you for a while, and I did it and I, and I, and I
1269520	1276320	fucking, I ruled the, the, you wrote monster house in that outfit, I think. No, the first 25 pages.
1276320	1284000	The character of Seth Brundle in Cronenberg's remake of the fly, Gina Davis opens up a closet
1284000	1288000	and she says, and she, and she goes, what, when are you going to change your clothes? And he goes,
1288000	1292560	I change them every day. And then she opens the closet and there's like five of the same outfit.
1292560	1297520	And she's like, what the hell? And he goes, I learned it from Einstein. You don't have to
1297520	1301840	waste your time thinking about outfits or whatever. And that's the moment when she like jumps on him
1301840	1306400	and starts making out with him. So I was like 13 and I was like, okay, so here we go. So
1307920	1311600	what's your outfit going to be? What are you going to wear for us? I'm glad you asked.
1312640	1317280	So I like always, I was, I went through these phases. I should do that. So here's the thing.
1317280	1321520	In the meantime, I've learned Einstein, he didn't learn that from Einstein. That's a myth. Einstein
1321520	1326400	wore whatever the fuck he wanted. Einstein wore pajamas on Monday. He always wore like black or
1326400	1332960	white or like grayish stuff. I mean, like check it out. Look online. Like it's, it's either,
1334560	1340960	but yet, yeah, I agree with you. I agree with you. Like he, uh, I totally agree with you. Like he
1340960	1346160	wore different types of shirts and jackets, but then we're either like black or white or grayish.
1346160	1351200	They were certainly shades of a gray scale. I think it was a thing because everybody around
1351280	1357200	him was at the time they were wearing that color and stuff. And that, not a lot. So Einstein
1357200	1364960	didn't do it. So the originator of that concept is Seth Brundle in the fly. So in keeping with
1364960	1370240	his principle, which he states in the movie, he credits Einstein with it, but Einstein never did
1370240	1375120	it. He's saying in the movie, he says, that way you don't have to expend any mental energy on
1375120	1380400	what you're going to wear. So what are you going to wear? What's the outfit going to be? Guess what?
1380480	1387200	Seth Brundle's outfit, which is well, those telepod leather jacket and jeans, the gray,
1387200	1395040	black and white herringbone, uh, suit jacket with a white collared shirt, a dark red tie and pants.
1396080	1398400	My assistant's in charge of tracking this stuff down.
1400560	1406480	That's a good look. But he said pants because the thing is when you Google Seth Brundle,
1406480	1413680	you don't get a clear look at any of his pants. A lot of the imagery is of a fly man climbing
1413680	1421200	on walls. Right. And he's wearing a tweed kind of jacket, like a herringbone. It's like a, yeah,
1421200	1426560	a tweed. No, he nailed everything for the waist up. You can see that. So you're going to freestyle
1426560	1430320	on the, on the waist down? The pants. No, freestyling necessary. We're going to watch the
1430320	1435120	movie together and we're going to get this right. Because you fucked up a little bit.
1435120	1441680	Do you remember like as they're like, do you go, go ahead. I'm sorry. Well,
1441680	1446720	now he's saying he disagreed. The thing is, if you go on the Google, despite Seth Brundle's
1446720	1451760	protests, he, he seems to be wearing three separate pairs of pants throughout the movie.
1451760	1458480	Whoa. It's the antithesis of his, uh, his claim is that he wears the same outfit. So the solution
1458480	1463680	to that problem is to make me try on and off the same pair of pants that are the wrong color over
1464160	1470240	three. Yeah. That was completely related to this. No. Yeah. We got to figure out. We had to pant.
1470240	1476720	See, we can't get his sizes. So I had to, I had to eyeball the eyeball the pants and then take
1476720	1480560	them to the tailor. And then they'd say, go, I can't hem this. You have to have them come in.
1480560	1485360	And I'd say, fuck you. And then they'd hem the pants and I'd bring them back and they'd be hemmed
1485360	1490320	wrong. And so I'd had to go back and get them to fix it again. So when you, when you, when you guys
1490320	1494320	figured this out, you were actually going to commit to wearing that outfit across the board.
1494320	1498960	Yeah. Very close. We've been burned before with the eye Harman. Uh, that, that, that,
1498960	1504160	that was a flash in the pan. Are you going to commit to this one or are you going to bail on it?
1504160	1510480	I feel like it. That's not, that's not, I don't do it for you. Well, no, I'm saying like you, you,
1510480	1514480	you wanted the, I need to have the eye Harman around your neck. I know what you're saying.
1514480	1520640	You want to, look, I, I want you to commit to this. I'm all for this. I want you to be consistent,
1520640	1524400	but you want to make it interesting. Sometimes you're my friend and then sometimes you're
1524400	1529280	attacking me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, I got a solution. What? Let's make it interesting.
1532480	1538320	All right. All right. A little side money. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. One year.
1538320	1546320	Too much, too much. We'll go down. We'll get out. How about this? When, when Stan,
1546320	1551280	once you find the outfit and I'm all for this, but I'm not antagonistic to this idea. Okay.
1552000	1557040	When you find the comfort zone, you go, okay, this, this is the color of the trouser. This is,
1557040	1562160	this is the jacket. This is the thing we're going to get. How many do you think Spencer
1562160	1566880	Dan will need? Five. Five? Yeah. Maybe less than that jacket. And then we'll put a calendar
1567680	1572800	right here, right here, right here. And then we'll check it out. I don't want to wear his shoes. I
1572800	1576960	don't like the fucking dress shoes. Okay. What do you want to do? I'm really, I like my.
1576960	1583040	Normal shoes. Okay. Those are, those are going to stay the same for a couple of years anyway. So
1584240	1590240	what do you mean? You strike, you strike me as somebody who doesn't wear a lot of different
1590240	1600560	shoes. I don't. See, Rob, Rob, Dan is hearing, Dan is hearing. You strike me as somebody who
1600560	1606480	don't change them shoes a lot. Dan, you're, you're hearing, you're hearing attack where there is
1606480	1615600	nothing. You need me to change those shoes, bro. Wearing the same old nasty ass shoes all the time.
1615600	1624880	You need to change them shoes. Dan, we're on your site. I'm totally. You're saying I'm not
1624880	1628880	attacking this at all. Are you guys perceiving me as being in a grumpy mood, like a defensive mood?
1628880	1633200	Well, I think right now, like there are times when you hear attack when there is none. You,
1633200	1638960	you hear combat when there is no combat. Really? I'm saying absolutely do that. I would love that.
1638960	1643520	Because like Steve Jobs, he wore the turtleneck. Right. And Zuckerberg. Look where he is now.
1643520	1644560	Where's the gray t-shirt?
1647520	1648880	Two biopics. Yeah.
1651440	1656240	Beat that. Follow that. Yeah. Look, look where Steve Brundle is. Or Brundle Fly.
1656240	1662320	Steve Brundle. Look where Steve Brundle is. The famous Steve Brundle that you've been talking
1662320	1667440	about for a while. All right. Well, we're off-roading now. So I hope you guys brought your show.
1669200	1672320	Because those are the. Do you remember? Do you remember the fly?
1672960	1676800	Why are you upset? We're saying yes at the end of this idea. No, no, I'm not. Don't tell me I'm
1676800	1682880	upset. You piece of shit. You seem bummed out. I want you to start wearing an outfit. I'm going to.
1682880	1687680	Yeah, but you're so. I want the pants to be right. Okay. I want to help you get the right pants.
1687680	1694000	I'm trying to get them right. We're going to get the right pants. All right. Of that we can be sure.
1694000	1698080	But I, my prediction is that you're going to go, this is going to. Stop miming eating.
1698080	1707360	I didn't know what else to do. Trying to. I think this is going to go the way of the eye
1707360	1712480	Harman or the last time you wore Einstein outfit where you wore your your powder blue
1712480	1716560	short sleeve tucked in button down shirt. Well, I want every kid out there listening
1716560	1723040	right now to listen to what Jeff's trying to do. What he's doing is called identity bullying.
1723440	1732160	Like if you decide one week that you want to be like captain EO, I'm trying to modernize the
1732160	1743120	reference. You want to shoot lasers and make people dance. If you go through a phase there
1743120	1747360	and you're like, Oh, I'm going to do this every day and then on Thursday, you're like, this is
1747360	1752720	boring. Go ahead. It's better to do it and get bored. I support all the way. Guys like this are
1752720	1759600	always going to be like, no, you got to hear your manufacturing confrontation. Don't listen
1759600	1767360	to him right now. He's he's going to tell you that you're manufacturing conflict. But what he,
1767360	1772880	what he, what he's trying to do by saying that is, is kill you and murder you. What Dan is doing
1772880	1778800	right now is apologizing for him wearing this, the, the Brundle fly out for two Harman towns
1778800	1791600	and then giving it up. Oh, I don't think we went to the outfit. Oh no. Oh no. The enemy. He's the
1791600	1798560	enemy. Like, like, like just follow your bliss. Follow your heart kids. You fall in love, fall in
1798560	1806720	love, love, love that person for two days. If you, if you don't love them for, for three days,
1806720	1814880	that's not on you or them. That's on God. I think, I think he brought me out too early is
1818080	1826800	let's send Rob off for a bit. We'll bring him out later on.
1831920	1834480	It was too early. It was too early.
1836800	1841680	Too, too early to bring our reps up. All right. I'm glad this happened because
1841680	1844560	to obviously tonight's about retooling the format of the show.
1846240	1848080	I'd like to bring Rob Shropp back out.
1852320	1858000	Because now it feels right. Now the timing is right. I want him to understand who's in charge.
1858000	1872000	I think it feels right. Rob, get up. Can you do a dance on this? Can you get up on top of the podium
1872000	1879200	here and do a little podium, man? I'm not going to get up on that. All right. Rob Shropp, everybody.
1879200	1889360	Thank you so much, Rob. Rob, you are welcome. You got any, you got any Lego spoilers for us?
1890160	1892720	Nope. All right. Rob Shropp, everybody.
1896480	1901920	There he goes. He's gone. Oh, he's leaving. No, he's staying. All right. See, I'm out of control
1901920	1907600	then. Yep. So the next time something goes wrong. What was the first moment you guys remember meeting
1907680	1911040	each other? Do you guys both have the same memory of the first time you guys locked eyes?
1912560	1919760	It was like it in the back of cults in Milwaukee. It's comedy sports probably. Or was it LA freeway
1919760	1930080	stand up? Yeah, it was a cult. Cult? He's probably there. I've been there. Oh yeah, you have been
1930080	1934160	there. I was there before. Yeah. After it was not comedy sports anymore, but I went there one time
1934160	1938960	with you guys. So what was the first time you guys met? What was the circumstance? Um, I don't
1938960	1944960	know. Just we were improv workshop. I don't, I don't know. Dan, you were like probably 18.
1945760	1956240	Seven, seven, 17, 17. I was 39. But I, yeah, I remember, yeah, I remember Rob being funny.
1958160	1963600	I remember when he was funny. The good old days. Yes, he was funny back then. Well,
1963600	1968880	I remember we, we, we, we, we did some improv exercises and then I remember you were
1969600	1974560	off. We were done with the workshop and you were sitting and then you had a bag of chips
1975200	1982400	and you had a soda and you were talking about how you had read that the chips had riboflavin in
1982400	1988160	them and that the riboflavin was a tenderizer and that it was designed the same companies
1988800	1993840	created the soft drinks and the chips and because the riboflavin tenderizes you.
1995920	2001760	And I don't think that's right. I think I don't think that's right. I don't think riboflavin does
2001760	2007200	that. Does anybody know what riboflavin does? Riboflavin, riboflavin does anybody? All right.
2008080	2011040	Well, that's not why I brought it up. That's what, that's my memory of you.
2012080	2016720	I didn't, I didn't think you were right. It's my memory of you. What was it? What was the first
2016800	2020960	moment when you guys connected and thought you guys could be like maybe friends? I remembered
2020960	2026720	like the first time I was about to do. That was a chair. That was a chair. What? That was a chair.
2029680	2035840	Dan farted from out there. It was a chair. Dan's blaming his fart on a chair. Sorry. It's a
2035840	2040240	terrible show tonight. It doesn't need to be a good one. It's pretty bad. It's $10. I'll give
2040240	2046480	you all your money back. It doesn't matter. Life doesn't matter. No. Just find someone you're
2046480	2058320	happy with. Just find someone you're happy with. Just find someone. Just feel around in the dark
2058320	2067040	and that's what I do too. I don't do the Seth Brundle thing. I get dressed. I get, I get up
2067040	2073280	before Kate does. So I get dressed in the dark. So that, that removes everything, you know. So I just
2073280	2079120	like oh okay this and that and then I walk out looking, looking a little, looking a little weird
2079120	2084320	sometimes. Do you ever wear like different the color socks and shoes? Oh god yes. For real. Oh
2084320	2091040	my gosh and it's crazy. Everybody goes wow who's this guy? Different colored socks because you
2091040	2096960	know how everybody looks at other people's socks. This is the shit that I would go through every
2096960	2102720	fucking Sunday morning with my mother you know and I would put on like white socks. You can't wear
2102720	2109440	white socks with dress shoes. I'm like who's looking at my socks in church? We're all sitting
2109440	2115600	down. I'm behind a pew. If they're looking at my socks maybe what we're listening to is fucking
2115600	2125760	boring. Hey that's a new commandment. Of the 11th commandment. Yeah. Try to be more interesting
2125760	2135920	than socks. Yeah right. Fix the air conditioning. At the premiere for Monster House,
2138480	2144640	because it's a Halloween movie, the invitation said where are your favorite Halloween costume?
2145200	2154800	And the only people that paid attention to that part of the invitation were Rob and his wife.
2156720	2159360	And some kid who dressed up as Jack Sparrow.
2162160	2166800	In order to get people to watch his Nickelodeon show. Right right. Like some kid that was like
2166800	2173360	oh I'm Jack Sparrow. Yeah so so Kate and I get up. So everybody is fucking Monster House world

2206480	2212480	up as Ram. You guys don't know who I am? No it's. You weren't there. I think didn't you do Ram
2212480	2217920	one time with the red something? I think you're thinking of a different Rob. That was back when
2217920	2222240	you were triple Jim in it. You used to go to the gym three times a day and this motherfucker was in
2222240	2229200	shape. I was crazy. Yeah he wore tights for a living. All you wore was like was a body suit
2229200	2234400	at all times. Not at all times but I could pull it off. You did? Yeah. Your ass was like a space
2234480	2245040	helmet. It was fucking. It was a good it was a good ass. It's a great ass. Not that you noticed.

2289520	2297280	you don't do stuff. No you don't. No it's a test. When someone says have fun it's a test. If you

2371440	2381040	these Chinese murder vans. No OK. I have not told me. I've filled everybody in. They murder. Spencer

2389280	2395280	they just going out randomly killing strangers. Yeah it's vengeance. OK. People who killed their
2395280	2404960	van parents. I read one article. Stock the streets. I'm picturing I'm picturing a Ford
2404960	2411280	O'Connell line bubble window van from the 70s. Like what kind of van are they. It's like one of
2411280	2417680	those. A lot more screaming. And do they do they kill you inside the van or do they jump out of
2417680	2423680	the van and kill you. They get back in the van. No. They kill you in the van. No. OK. Sorry. This is
2423680	2428240	a joke. I've talked about this before. No. The real the real the real thing that's been happening
2428240	2438800	in my life is Lord of the Rings. That's the real thing is happening. No no. OK. So I was I was on
2438800	2445120	the computer. I built a computer. No. Yeah. No. I know it's hard to believe Rob. That was on the
2445200	2451280	computer. I recognize that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know where this is going. And I get a phone call
2451280	2458800	from Rob Schwab. Yeah. What did you say. I work my computer. No no no. No I'm driving in because
2458800	2462400	I worked at Legos. Oh you were driving. I'm driving driving and I'm going huh.
2464320	2471760	Like yo. Yo Spence what's up. So so I'm masturbating and I'm like I'm just you know
2472560	2478240	I'm just on I'm just on that internet. I'm on that Kotaku dot com. No no no go that we don't
2478240	2482640	we don't have the VR this just go ahead go ahead and explain. I'm just telling the people what
2482640	2489360	happened. Oh no you explained what's called me up. What's Kotaku dot com. It's just a website
2489360	2496080	that's not porn. But he's your guy. Yeah no. OK. That's what I tell Rob when he calls me when I'm
2496080	2500880	drinking. I got you. What site were you on. Oh no I was playing Minecraft. Oh Joe.
2503120	2510880	All right. Come on. OK OK OK. Let's get serious. So I go. I'm driving and I have a question. So I
2510880	2519920	called our dungeon master and I went hey why is it called Lord of the Rings when there's only one
2519920	2528800	ring. What I like. I don't and I don't understand that because as far as what I'm seeing and I've
2528800	2535360	read these four books in the books and stuff like that I go there seems to be only one ring one ring
2535360	2541760	and it's the ring of invisibility and Bilbo got it and then and then did the other rings do what.
2541760	2549600	Well well first of all where are they. And the first 15 seconds of the movie. Oh well the name
2549600	2557760	the fucking whole thing after it. Oh my God. Oh oh my God. I'm sorry. I must be mistaken. The first
2557760	2566640	15 seconds of the whole thing. No. OK. Name the whole thing after it then. If that's what the
2566640	2574080	story is about. If that's what the story is about. Oh it isn't. It's not what the story is about.
2574080	2585680	Right. OK. Hey. Let's call it. Let's call it King Kong. But there's only one King Kong. Yes but he had
2585680	2599920	a mother and a father. Doesn't make sense. So King Kong would be called like the Kong family.
2600720	2606800	I mean like he could say like I mean like think about the pitch like he walks into whatever bar
2606800	2613360	with C.S. Lewis and and and and there's there's fucking H.P. Lovecraft hanging out in the corner
2613360	2619200	and got who just got done with my my whole books. Oh man. What's it what's it about. It's called
2619200	2624640	Lord of the Rings. Wow. Oh wow. Is it about like a guy a lord who like finds all these rings and
2624800	2629360	then and then and then and then there's like it's like fighting over all these rings. No.
2631600	2637600	It's nothing to do with rings. It's just one ring. Well off to my my my why not just
2637600	2642240	after my series of 17 books that are all about lions witches and wardrobes.
2644720	2651120	Yeah. Hey it's more accurate than. But there's not even a Lord of the Rings like like I mean
2651120	2656960	presumably whoever made all those rings was a Lord of the Rings. But the story about him.
2656960	2662640	There's no but that person is like well he's the Lord of one ring. He he's talking about
2662640	2669280	he made all the right. I don't think so. I don't think movies were you guys watch. I'm pretty sure
2670080	2675760	all the ring. I'm pretty sure elves made all the rings gave them to dwarves. No three of them to
2675760	2682960	humans. No Sauron had a guy make all the rings they gave him to gifted them. Whoa whoa whoa whoa
2682960	2688000	Levy what does it say you're looking up on Wikipedia right. Steve Levy get out of Steve
2688000	2694960	Levy everybody Steve get out. I'm sure someone knows. This isn't this isn't a debate. No no no
2694960	2700240	it is. It is. It is. It is a debate. I'm taking it down and I'm going to win. It's not a debate.
2700480	2706400	No it is. What do the other rings do. They turn. Whoa here's the thing that pisses me off. Okay
2707600	2712320	my name is Sauron. I have this ring and now I'm really powerful. I'm going to do this thing with
2712320	2715920	the sword and everybody's going to fly all over the place because I did this thing with the sword
2715920	2720880	and I'm so powerful because I'm wearing this ring and then somebody cuts off my finger and it falls
2720880	2726560	down and blah blah blah blah blah and okay the Bilbo gets it he puts it on and turns invisible.
2727440	2733680	Why why why come on. That's always been fucked up. Sauron isn't invisible. He isn't invisible.
2733680	2738160	He's wearing this ring and he doesn't turn invisible. I would if I were to if I were a
2738160	2744880	little clunky. If I were to defend the mythology I would say that that the cowardice of of mortal
2744880	2751680	beings means that the most the biggest power that you would have if a ring of that power
2752320	2758080	uh imbued itself and you that the very first and foremost thing you would do before you could fly
2758080	2762800	or do anything that you would just be a creepy creepy invisible person that that but that's me
2762800	2768400	apologizing for a mythology that I agree is flawed however it's not the he made he had a bunch of
2768400	2772800	rings made the whole point was that he had all these rings made the ring of power is the ring
2772800	2777440	that like he controls all the rings all right he had a bunch of rings had a bunch of rings before
2777440	2785360	the story started okay good let's do three books about not that what does Steve have to say
2785360	2790240	uh well Spencer's right it was an elf right or something yeah here's what they did they killed
2790240	2795280	they killed Sauron and they went well fuck that guy had that one ring we need to have rings to
2795280	2800320	battle evil when if that ever comes back yeah but let's let's never let's never talk about him or
2800320	2804080	use him ever well let's just here's the first thing that comes up when you write who made the
2804080	2809760	rings in lord of the rings well i i know because i played the video game right yeah i met that guy
2809760	2818000	i worked for him spoilers met him i had lunch with him he gave me superpowers that were seriously
2819440	2825360	compatible with the warner brothers interactive game i'm sorry i'm so sorry hobbit is the only
2825360	2835440	good book do you hear that that's the sound of just failure yeah i don't care who cares about
2835440	2842160	books like no one says that you're like like like like right people hate books the back of a we're
2842160	2846240	in the back we're in the back of a comic book store not in the comic book store the idea that
2846240	2851120	the thing that threw you is that that that's all explained in the beginning they made a bunch of
2851120	2855120	rings and there was one ring to rule them all and in the darkness behind them the thing that
2855200	2861200	should throw you is that after three movies that span nine years it turns out all you got to do
2861200	2866720	to set things right is talk to green ghosts well that's not true that didn't insult go to a story
2866720	2872640	at all everything the green ghosts go
2873680	2878240	lord of the green ghosts yeah king of the that i would that i would agree that's a better title
2878240	2883680	lord of the rings there's there's only one green ghosts all right call it the ring movie can we
2883760	2889360	talk about vaccinations talk about aids hey do you guys like oh shit aids i don't like

2927120	2932240	yeah but there is no lord of the rings like the the elven king jesus christ it's obviously
2932240	2938080	fucking sauron will he only have saurons then call it sauron then call the call all three books
2938080	2951760	sauron dear jrr token you misnamed your book that in 2015 there's 90 movies about what what
2951760	2956800	did he do wrong hey yeah he named it wrong i mean if something's popular then it's right hitler
2956800	2968000	kaboom sauron kaboom yeah called it there you go lord of the rings there's so many things to
2968000	2972880	complain about okay i'm i'm reading the second one there's going to be hopefully at least another
2972880	2980000	ring coming up here there's no other ring there's still one ring he loves the rings he loves rings
2980000	2984240	that's why you watched the movie you love rings you knew you knew there were gonna be a million
2984240	2988080	rings i like i like the ring in the hobbit i thought it was oh yeah so you wanted a million
2988080	2992480	rings because it would be court of the rings you watch a million rings what are the other
2992480	2998320	rings you love rings you love rings you love movies about jewelry i like accurate i like i
2998320	3003840	like it be consistently yeah yeah yo you love logic that's why you want die hard to be called
3003840	3012560	uh guy in a tower but that's an accurate yeah no that'd be great meep my move no no no no no
3012960	3016960	i'm on your side i enjoy my movies die hard is a good title die hard is better than a guy
3018000	3020480	yeah but it's not die hard a lot
3023280	3026720	well here's the thing he doesn't die hard in the movie
3027760	3033200	he fucking lives he stays alive yeah forever yeah well that all of the series are called
3033200	3039280	die hard he hasn't died yet it's hard for him to die it's a he's a hard dire it's a hard die
3039280	3046400	hard dire would actually hard dire see i love die hard as a title but die harder is a better
3047600	3056880	hard die hard dire yeah what's that he's like a die hard like something like people yeah he's
3056880	3063520	a die hard i'm a die hard liver yeah he's the badass no he's the die hard yeah yeah
3063520	3067760	oh yeah there was a there was a battery a car battery they probably still have them called
3067760	3072720	die hard yeah that kind of excited that you were so passionate that you would cry that out
3073680	3079840	are you that big a die hard fan oh okay and now no no i don't know where to go with you
3082000	3087520	my mom are you a fan of yelling things out or bruce willis or john mctearnan or
3088160	3093760	i'm a fan of making people believe what i want them to okay so you're so you're a witch you're
3095120	3100320	or a hypnotist all right well do you have powers of persuasion
3103840	3111760	no you don't i found out at the same time though i was you know how old were dan you're you know
3111760	3118800	about the same age how old were we when die hard came out was uh i was 24 all right i was 15
3119760	3124640	so then i was 14 or 15 and i my mom and i were really in the die hard together because i'm just
3124640	3131680	slightly out of you uh my mom was really in the die hard and every time i came on tv we'd watch
3131680	3136880	it together and i loved die hard but i found out like the third time he watched it that she just
3136960	3145840	had a giant boner for alexander good enough the blonde bad guy you know i want blood yeah
3146720	3151360	not dissimilar from nick manning pussy juice on dick
3154240	3158000	do you watch that guy's porn because you enjoy him as a character or because what's happening
3158000	3164800	is sexy wait okay it has to be both like like like why why why i think in a world where there
3164800	3172960	do you enjoy him as every second that we're sitting here another five thousand pieces of
3172960	3180000	porn are made right um we clearly if you took one step back from our species and looked at the media
3180000	3185120	we create as as you would with the honeybees making whatever they make and don't say honey
3185120	3191120	don't say honey they make wax they make wax if you took a step back and looked at what we create
3191120	3200560	media wise you would go these people love porn they make a lot of it per second so the question
3200560	3206080	the answer to the question was i watching nick manning to like hear them make fun or to get
3206080	3212720	turned on it's like i bathed in it i fucking open up i'm like give me what you got and he's like
3212720	3217840	he he didn't say drop and loads and i'm like i yeah i eventually came
3217840	3226320	but you like him as a like he i don't like him you don't like him i don't know him but
3226320	3231360	i this he might be conservative i don't know him he might be like dropping loads we should
3232240	3238000	tag muslims i want to drop a load on each muslim that you can read at an airport
3239680	3245360	what is rob doing here rob is getting complicated i'm getting comfortable because he's sitting

3360080	3367840	remember you know an l.a story when uh steve martin and what's your name they're like they're like
3367840	3377920	and they go out in the garden and i hope that's not fucking well they fucked they fucked that's
3377920	3382960	the scene where they fuck but it's like like there's an enya song playing like we came to
3382960	3390560	l.a because we wanted uh you know we wanted to be who we are now yeah but like
3393200	3398400	that's not it's not like being who we are now required us like holding hands and like running

3450320	3455360	not that's not something that you can do like nobody can hurt remember remember that one new

3676320	3683680	we were like a hyper speed like dan's dancing all over the place robin took off and ran down the
3683760	3690000	street and like it was just like it was the i think the most high i've ever been in my life
3690000	3696240	like the walls were growing hair and everything was like black light but there was nothing on and
3696240	3703280	we were and and then like steve aji gave me like a uh like a what it gave me a hand job
3704480	3710400	no he gave he gave me like a couple days earlier like a videotape of of like like unaired famous
3710960	3714240	unaired pilots that you've never seen or something like that just clips of it
3714240	3721280	and they had like the pilot the original pilot for the munsters oh god oh god oh god
3722640	3727360	what you don't know is that they shot two pilots that night that was that night that was a night
3727360	3734400	that's when the oh boy it took i took it became a bad trip yeah it became a bad yeah yeah yeah
3734400	3739280	because i was like i'm fucking i could dance i really so happy and then we watched your legs
3739520	3744000	i couldn't see them anymore they were moving so fast i was like there's a god god god made the
3744000	3749520	game god made my feet i was like i get nothing to do with this perfect perfect perfect the game was
3749520	3757280	like who are you like call konami you you have a you have a vacation awaiting you and i was like
3757280	3763600	man i can't so you lose and i put in this but then yeah but then we yeah we watched original
3763600	3768800	munsters there was like is that the original munsters so you guys don't even know the munsters
3768800	3774560	but there was like a herman munster and there was a mrs munster and there was other munsters um who
3774560	3781920	knows the munsters okay okay there was a there was a son there was a son eddie eddie thanks kids
3781920	3790720	thanks he was uh he had a widow's peak and blah blah blah that's the recast like that's
3790720	3798800	the michael j fox there was an eric stoltz of uh the monsters so then they showed it and it was
3798800	3805040	like and the kid's name was like happy something happy smith happy smith or whatever same cast the
3805040	3811440	original idea with eddie munster is that he was part werewolf yeah and so and they show the munsters
3811440	3816640	it's a fred gwyn and he's the every everything's the normal munsters and then this fucking kid
3816640	3824080	comes down the stairs and goes ah and he was like a werewolf boy and like we were on mushrooms
3824080	3830400	and shit got dark we we because i don't remember putting in the tape but i put it in tape and then
3830400	3833840	we were like watching and then we just said oh whatever we started talking about yeah man you
3833840	3838240	know like it's just so great that we know each other after all this time and just your comedy
3838240	3841760	is just speaks to me i remember when dan was doing such a good job dancing that was so great
3841760	3847360	how come we all became morris all of a sudden and we were like
3848960	3856160	and it became a bummer because once when you're doing psychedelic drugs like oh yeah have a great
3856160	3860480	time but then there's that always that moment when there's one thing that oh my you're like
3860480	3866720	wait if that's true if a kid if there's a kid who thought he was going to be eddie munster who never
3866720	3871920	got to be eddie munster just because he was ugly and terrifying which is what monsters are supposed
3871920	3877840	to be like like like like well then what are we and what are we doing with our lives and why am i
3877840	3884560	32 and on drugs like i have shit to do i like like my accountant is wondering where i am tonight
3884560	3889760	and he just fucking tailspin i wanted to kill myself it's pretty it's pretty weird like just
3889760	3895360	imagine like any sitcom where everything's the same except the one thing that was like a side
3895360	3904240	character comes in and it's just like yeah yeah yeah i mean that that was the original version
3904240	3908960	of eddie munster pretty funny but it didn't really reply but it was just laying with them
3908960	3913760	but there's a there's a different party as long as they're fucked they fucked the show there
3913760	3919600	there's a different party what was the party where we're like what were you what was it halloween
3919600	3926640	where all the you're not going to tell them why are you doing costumes and then like like
3926640	3930400	everyone came over and we're like ah this party is not working and there was i guess there was
3930400	3934240	some ecstasy or something and yeah maybe we were tripping and maybe we weren't but i think it was
3934240	3938320	dressed no one knew if they were tripping or not you weren't then like one person said well you
3938320	3946640	know what i'm gonna go who yeah shrub was dressed as tron i was i was dressed as i was 99 cents to
3946640	3950880	our cowboy i made a cowboy outfit out of all things from the 99 cent store so i had a giant
3950880	3956560	cowboy hat made of kitten calendars and uh uh so we were all we were super high and the party ended
3956560	3961680	up in your office which is like the smallest room in the apartment and we're on bean bags
3963200	3969360	and then someone said well i'm gonna go and then shrub had this disney land they give kids these
3969440	3974800	swingy things what do they a little little spinny things like i don't know you spin around and then
3974800	3984080	shrub was in his tron costume and and so he's a little knot in a little turgid penis okay
3984080	3989440	visible and there's like like like head to toe spandex tron circuitry and then he's
3990880	3998080	and then you're waving these disney things and then you go why are you leaving why are you leaving
3998160	4004800	why are you leaving and then other people started going why are you leaving gay party gay party
4007040	4010880	gay party gay party why are you leaving and everyone's going
4010880	4016640	gay party gay party and then i said why are you leaving why are you leaving gay party it was
4016640	4025200	politically incorrect then too but the idea was um the uh well there was no idea it was just a
4025200	4029760	funny experience this is how and it went on forever to the point the point is kids stop to
4029760	4036720	do more drugs just get together in your apartments in your homes and do them in my bedroom you guys
4036720	4042640	uh like in my bedroom i have a picture from my i think it's my 27th birthday and it's rob

4207440	4214080	what's your name young lady tara tara sorry to call you young lady i'm sure that's
4214080	4220320	in some some view that's gotta be that's gotta be somehow uh shut up buddy
4222000	4224320	don't don't don't don't don't old man spleen
4226560	4232320	how to talk to a young lady tara where are you from um from new york long island oh yeah
4232960	4237120	are you a la resident now are you visiting uh yeah i just moved here like a month ago
4238000	4244960	welcome thanks you enjoying it yeah yeah settling in yeah what part of long island you from i'm from
4245680	4251200	south shore sepha county oh yeah yeah you miss it your family all there yeah everyone's there
4251200	4257200	yeah i don't miss long island i miss my family what brought you out here i'm sorry i'm sorry
4258320	4261760	i'm not making fun of you i just don't know what to do i don't know why i'm here what brought you
4261840	4268880	to la tara a bunch of reasons i kind of came for the sun actually the sun yeah and but a bunch
4268880	4279680	of things yeah job maybe try stand-up comedy oh yeah yeah so now you said that you're going
4279680	4286560	through some some tough pain right now uh yeah i'm just like very severely depressed and can't
4286560	4293040	really seem to get past it is it sort of just as a general thing because you've come out to la
4293040	4297040	you're living here is it what we could predict which is you don't know what you're doing you
4297040	4302320	don't know where you're going yeah i mean depressed my whole life for sure but like putting myself
4302320	4309520	alone in a new city severe like has triggered it to a point where do you have friends or any kind
4309520	4313840	of like uh connections when you came out or you came out totally alone no i came out totally alone
4314080	4318880	which is a really good sign because a lot of people don't do that i didn't do that yeah
4318880	4324000	shrub had to come out to la for me to come out i i never would have gone out that's you i have
4324000	4330560	to commend you that is a very ballsy thing to do because like dan and i in milwaukee said for years
4330560	4335120	we gotta get out of here we gotta go to los angeles i never would have done it if it wasn't
4335120	4339680	if dan would have gone if he was that i'm not gonna go i would have stayed there so to do it
4339680	4346240	by yourself is really commendable thank you yeah it's it's it doesn't necessarily
4347200	4351760	foretell anything which i think that's the big crucial issue how old are you see me i'm gonna
4351760	4357680	if we can ask how old right 27 27 uh like that's how old i was when i came out so the importance
4357680	4364160	of uh i was way younger than that um to me i was like why is he even bothering to come out
4364160	4371680	27 yeah uh but the the the when we talk about age when we think about it the big crucial issue
4371680	4376480	is outcome it's like it's like oh i'm gonna i need to accomplish this by this stage and all
4376480	4381280	this stuff like like like that's the big thing and so it's i think you come to a big city like
4381280	4385440	l.a or new york and it's like oh the reason i'm coming here is because this is the place where
4385440	4390400	you plug into this mainframe and then i'm going to become this like heightened version of myself
4390400	4395760	and it's going to be at the mercy of this bartender or this agent or this like flyer or
4395760	4404400	this workshop and you don't you're fucking dizzy and like like wondering because i'm sure back
4404400	4412320	home you've got probably a tribe of people that bless their hearts maybe aren't totally going
4412320	4418320	totally i get it go audition for everything they're not like auditioning for and don't have
4418320	4426560	expectation of joining the entertainment world but so you're right now at 27 you're going i got
4426560	4434480	out here i'm just gonna okay so i'm exiting a four-year like relationship i was gonna say
4434480	4442240	emotionally abusive relationship so i kind of fleed a state to come to this state to get away
4442240	4450240	from that guy yeah yeah good for you good for you he's not he's not a bad guy i'm not an angel
4450240	4460320	either so whatever i kind of i had it coming just so you guys know yeah but but but sometimes like
4460320	4466800	like like negative negative things like that's that's rocket fuel like the way the way rockets
4466800	4472000	get off the ground is by firing things in the opposite direction like that negative stuff is
4472000	4477120	something that can get you into you know into orbit and like to go to places you want to go so
4477760	4484960	but like that's that's well i'm very happy that you uh that you chose to land here on a sunday
4484960	4489360	night with us that's very cool well do you have big fears about tomorrow like i'm sure you have
4489360	4494880	like what what's the what's the financial issue like la's an expensive place what's your situation
4494880	4501120	i do have a job i got a job before i came here i work as a behavioral therapist with autistic kids
4501120	4506080	oh yeah well that sounds like it pulls down a lot of year
4508480	4513600	that's you that's here i guess i just have like christmas blues i just like cried for two days
4513600	4521040	i watched uh the faults in our stars last night oh god oh my god oh god that's the best movie
4521040	4527040	ever it's like it's like human drain oh i've been crying the fault in our stars is there
4527040	4533760	is there is there more than one star in the movie because if i haven't seen it yet
4536320	4542240	if i go seeing it and they're just like oh well there's just one star i'm i'm gonna my brain will
4542240	4549600	blow up it'll blow up it'll blow up my brain will blow up it'll blow up it'll blow up my brain's
4549680	4560640	gonna blow i happen to have seen that movie i was 42 years old in a luxury hotel in venice
4561600	4568400	at christmas time with a woman i loved very much there was absolutely nothing wrong with my life
4568400	4575120	and that movie fucked me made me wobbly like i was like what is a gondola what does it matter
4576080	4582400	so if if if you're if you're 27 and you're like like you don't you don't necessarily have a
4582400	4587600	mortgage and a health plan and like you watch that movie that's good that's like fucking what
4587600	4595920	do they call it a neti pot that shit clears you out that movie will fuck you up watch it
4595920	4602320	watch it you piece of shit you need to watch jeff damas you need to watch the fault in our stars

4624880	4631520	fuck it yeah yeah yes yes do you play yeah sorry give us a second

4890640	4895760	start past is that like a thing that you put on this sounds like a joke but do you tell the
4895760	4900240	into the interview you're like no no i just find jobs that like i i've worked in schools i can't do
4900240	4905760	it um i just have found a job that you can start later on and work till seven so you you consider
4906080	4911200	you're saying you you you suffer from depression like like like across the board yeah the whole
4911200	4916720	time all every time like are you taking medication for it and and what what what an occasion
4918160	4923760	and anytime you want to just say i don't you're prying i don't you don't have to answer anything
4923760	4929040	but but but but like so well returned but but like from what age were you when you were like
4929120	4932160	i'm fucking clinically depressed what what when did you know
4935360	4943840	i mean always felt like sad for sure but like probably around like going away to college
4944400	4949600	really like fell like plummeted down just being like what got shipped upstate to like
4949600	4955920	upstate new york school was like completely like alone in the cold and just like shit is it a
4955920	4960240	daily thing or is it something that kind of comes and goes or is it day to day it's like day to day
4962080	4968720	did it start to affect you what was the tipping point where you went to a doctor and started
4968720	4973920	treating it as if it was a clinical thing as opposed to a thing that was wrong with you that
4973920	4980080	you were dealing with on your own get leaving college did you drop out i dropped out but i
4980080	4986880	went back but i dropped out when at 18 went home and was just completely depressed and then my mom
4986880	4990960	you know it was like so you dropped out because you you were you're like i can't handle college
4990960	4995520	yeah things so there was a there was a course this is important to a lot of people that are
4995520	5001040	listening like you you you there was a point where you were like oh there's something neat
5001040	5008800	you know you there was a point where you atoned with this thing where you were like oh i it's
5008800	5015120	medical i i i mean and i'm sure as a smart person you're like well i don't want somebody
5015120	5022000	in a lab coat telling me why my personality it's frustrating because i understand it and i know it
5022000	5027280	and but the behaviors won't change and like my emotions won't change so like i understand
5027280	5034080	everything about it and it's so frustrating it's so frustrating do you think that like so taking
5034080	5040800	well butrin like it what does that do does it like kind of even you out just like everything's
5040800	5045840	not like sharp edges i'm not like reacting to things so harshly it just kind of like takes
5045840	5051200	the edge off of things is there anything that you miss like do you feel zombified by well i
5051200	5056720	stopped taking ssris because they completely like take away your sex drive and make you gain weight
5056800	5064560	what is ssr right um like serotonin uptake inhibitor so what what what selective serotonin
5064560	5070960	uptake inhibitor is that that defines a different kind of medication psychology major um well that
5070960	5075840	defines a certain type of medication yeah that affects like the surgeon is like a it's a maor
5075840	5082320	which i don't even know what its answer okay so so serotonin like which is like yeah okay all right
5082320	5091360	i'm excuse me i have a million questions uh the the so that happened at what age in your life
5092000	5095360	like when you cross that threshold where you're like i'm going to deal with this
5095360	5099280	and you've been on well breacher in that whole time no i've been on ssris up until
5100160	5106080	but those are terrible yeah yeah i know okay i'm sorry on them because doctors just you just trust
5106080	5110720	your doctor and forever and i was just like oh cool so i was on them for so long but then
5111360	5115040	didn't like the effects kept trying to take myself off but then kept having like
5115600	5121680	really bad episodes and then like finally talked to like actually a holistic psychologist
5121680	5125840	psychiatrist who helped me find like the right medication that matched with like what i
5125840	5133280	was good for my body so it's a like really long process because like your brain is a fucking like
5133280	5139920	fireworks display and like every drug yeah when you're 12 years old people are going to be like
5139920	5144720	this person should have cotton balls taped to their skull and it's like oh yeah i'm sure that
5144720	5152800	would help them behave and i'm now i'm i'm clearly pursuing an agenda but it just seems
5152800	5157680	like like i have a i have a problem with doctors and pharmacology and stuff but at the same time
5157680	5163680	like it's it would you say is going through this labyrinth that you've found like a pill that
5164640	5171920	that it doesn't it's not like oh shit i'm i'm at the top of my game no what's like i like
5172800	5179520	if it stays like this for like another 10 years or so i think like i don't think i would try like
5179520	5183680	i don't know like ec like i don't know like i don't know the next step what you would do if you're
5183680	5188160	like depressed forever well what do you think i don't i mean go there that was the dark crevice
5188160	5191120	that you just approached like what would you say like what were you about to say
5191920	5196320	if it was going to say ecc but what does that mean what is it like electroshock therapy
5196320	5202960	well i mean put that wow really yeah i don't know i've heard that works you would you like um like
5204240	5209360	one um one of my favorite authors was severely depressed and he did like he did that after
5209360	5213200	like multiple years but then he ended up killing himself so all right who was that
5213920	5217040	David Foster Wallace yeah that's what i thought you were gonna say
5218000	5227200	jeez well don't i'm not going to kill myself don't you say David Foster Wallace was like don't say
5227200	5234160	that and then don't do that Tara like what's a good day for you like like do you i have
5234160	5239760	plenty of good days yeah and that's just what like just i'm really into yoga so i do a lot of yoga
5239760	5246080	um get up if i get to do yoga go to work i started doing like stand up three weeks ago
5246080	5251280	really yeah so awesome where like i just open mics that's so cool that's fucking
5251280	5257120	balling as hell yeah i have a crazy now you feeling that that is like in lieu of like all
5257120	5262160	this fucking like labyrinth i don't want to keep questioning these guys and their lab coats and
5262160	5269840	stuff but like i i feel like when you have thoughts in your head and you say them into
5269840	5276320	a microphone and then they can laugh or they can cry or they can sit in silence but what they
5276320	5281440	don't do is the thing that you're afraid that they might do inside your head like the thing
5281440	5285840	that you would project where they would go like oh you're a fucking animal i'm gonna fucking take
5285840	5292960	you and kill you like like i think like like like like just talking just saying it this is very
5292960	5300240	very self-justifying of me like but that that's i'm not saying it will supplant any kind of therapy
5300240	5306720	but i think that's fantastic for you like to just like communicate and talk empty your head
5306720	5311600	everything that's in your head no matter how crazy it is all those jagged edges you're talking about
5311680	5317120	i need to like put them out there and then all these people out there like like oh yeah totally
5317120	5323520	okay like got it or some of them are like really wow okay new thing to think about and and like in
5323520	5329760	any case it's like it's gone also just to be able to like come up like tonight not that like we're
5329760	5335840	any big help but like to come up and say the word depression and know that's a thing and say it out
5335840	5342320	loud because we all know people like you know like like robin robin williams on our show like
5342320	5346400	we met him and stuff and like like that wasn't something that was really talked about you know
5346400	5352880	and he like he dealt with his own shit for like for a long long time and because of him and what
5352880	5359200	what happened to him uh a lot of comics and like especially comics that i know that deal with
5359200	5365680	depression like said oh fuck like i can i can talk about that and i need to talk about that
5365680	5370560	and and that's a conversation that could happen and it's not something that's a fake thing it's
5370560	5376800	a real thing and it's a it's pretty common thing too especially among artists and like like in
5376800	5383840	this community so like that you know like there was there was a time when no one said they had
5383840	5388240	cancer and so people just quietly had cancer and didn't get treatment because that wasn't something
5388240	5393840	you did you didn't talk about it so it's it's good to like like open up the like lines of
5393840	5399040	communication on that and like like i mean i can't imagine what that must be like but it's it's very
5399680	5404960	impressive that you can make the journey out to the city and start doing stand-up which is
5404960	5410880	terrifying i do improv stand-up scares me uh like yeah well sadness is never talked about it's like
5410880	5416320	it's people too sad so but it's like fucking hilarious yeah well yeah hilarious and you're
5416320	5424640	like put like a piece to it like i'm always harping on that it sounds like like the the
5424640	5429440	campbell talked about that it's like the first joke we hear is the game of peekaboo which is
5429440	5435840	like a kid it's just a kid that they need their mom to be there so bad that their mom not being
5435840	5442240	there is terror is the equivalent of death and so the mom not really realizing that she's playing on
5442240	5450240	death with the kid goes like like like it's it's it's it's it's universal like it doesn't matter
5450240	5456080	it transcends language culture everything it's like moms with little kids they they they do this
5456080	5463360	thing they cover their face and the baby starts to go and then the mom like exposes her face
5463360	5473840	and the baby goes i beat death it's it's the first joke and they're like like because comedy
5473840	5479600	is fucking like it's it's like it only comes from the gut when it's like no i understand
5479600	5486480	death like like despair like the the the bottoms and the tops of of this entire valve that we're
5486480	5491120	being pushed through that's that's what it is and the great stand-ups like like all the all the all
5491120	5495680	my heroes of stand-up like there's an incredible awesome terrifying loneliness that goes on for
5495680	5500720	the great stand-ups they get out there and are willing to stand alone on stage and expose
5500720	5506720	themselves like that like that's that's a tremendous amount of courage and and to be good at that is
5506720	5513440	to be willing to like wallow in that like that solitude but yeah coming out to l.a by yourself
5513440	5519280	and subjecting yourself to that like who knows if you'd ever be funny but like god knows like
5519280	5523600	yeah the the the you're you're already on the right path like like step on the gas in that
5523600	5528480	direction you would stand in front of a microphone and go i would experiment with like what's the
5528480	5532480	least funny thing i could say to these people what's the thing i could say that would make
5532480	5539360	them want to blow their brains out because they're one step from that to a amazing punch line which
5539360	5547120	is mitch headberg and like like like like you know it probably a bad example the the it's not
5547120	5552320	a bad example because it's like fucking great comics they fucking they they die young because
5552320	5558000	they're they're all over the place artists are all over the place um on the back of my
5558000	5562880	forgive yourself for being all over the place for sure like like like like like like like like like
5562880	5567440	just like a monday it's like i'm the greatest person in the world and monday afternoon it's
5567440	5574160	like i'm such a piece of shit i like like that's absolutely that's called being creative i think
5574160	5579760	that's the engine that drives it that's not a license to be like i call the lumber yard and go
5579760	5586800	i'm not gonna do lumber anymore dan harman told me if i have mood swings i'm an artist
5588960	5596560	it's not necessarily true like like it's but what it is is it's it's absolutely part and parcel of
5597520	5602560	creating shit for sure i kind of feel like we dragged you up and asked you for your bullshit
5602560	5605920	and then told you about your shit that you probably already know they were like let me
5605920	5610960	tell you another thing young lady um but but the big takeaway is that you're not alone there's
5610960	5614960	there's there's so many people i mean this podcast has helped a lot like no these pieces of shit
5614960	5619440	they're they're here for everybody honestly i mean the fact that like half the crowd knew when you
5619440	5625040	said srt is whatever that thing was like a couple people were like boo and a couple people were like
5625040	5631040	yeah people knew what it meant like this there's probably a handful or more of people that also
5631040	5639520	like suffer from depression here like it's right yup dave cline you're depressed dave cline's
5639520	5646160	deep deep deep deep depression suffer we made it rob shrill's birthday we do you had my birthday

5711600	5721360	just flush them when when i use me miss midlady i yeah just uh put put them in the battery tech
5721360	5728720	think i'd ryan ridgley's not here uh what you would you do as the owner of staying up here uh
5728720	5738720	uh and playing a shadow run with us okay hey i love it all right you missed my ryan ridgley
5738720	5746800	impression uh kids if you're feeling sad talk to talk to people you gotta talk to someone you're
5746800	5752480	not alone don't do anything uh that she's not a case in point she's an adult and was like dealing
5752480	5757040	with her shit i'm saying just as long as we're on the topic because we i have i have a tumblr and
5757040	5761920	i get these messages and these kids are like fucking like tell me what to do and like like
5761920	5770320	they're on the precipice it's a fucking like like if you're if you're below 35 you like like and
5770320	5775360	you're thinking about like like like like the extreme version of the solution to your problems
5776320	5782640	just before you do that experiment since you're about to do that just try talking to somebody
5782640	5787920	just talk to somebody take uh it's not like like like like just just give it a shot do something
5787920	5793040	crazy like go walk go walk across yeah yeah yeah if i'm gonna do it i'm gonna just like
5793920	5798240	try and walk across america first like like if you're gonna hit the point as long as you would
5798240	5801920	just do something crazy like do something crazy and i know there's see if it changes anything
5801920	5805600	in your brain but it will stress that's one of the aggravating things when you're in that state
5805600	5808160	because you can't help you don't have any energy to do it is that people approaching you logically
5808160	5811920	and saying the reason you shouldn't do it is because look at the it's a wonderful life and
5811920	5817760	it's like fuck you that's it's not a logic thing it's just like fucking it's a grand theft auto
5817760	5824560	thing like you're about to do it just fucking do one thing first talk to somebody you gotta
5824560	5830000	hear it it's rattling around in your brain it's not like just fucking have it come out of your
5830000	5837280	mouth everybody feels that way sometimes you may feel that way all the time like you gotta talk
5837360	5840720	to somebody about it like if you're under a certain age it's an epidemic
5843360	5849840	where's podcast over 35 it stops i've said no i'm just saying like over 35 if you want to kill
5849840	5859120	yourself fuck you well i'm kidding it's a hard line dead sticking a hard line and it's a joke
5859120	5864480	man it's a joke well terra thank you uh like no she's for we open the bottom bottom all of our
5864480	5871920	hearts that's fucking yeah no thank you for being vulnerable for sharing your thank you guys
5871920	5877440	yeah like take take whatever pain you've got there and like turn it into beautiful artwork
5877440	5881680	for the rest of it don't tell her what to do because that's i think that you if you look back
5881680	5885680	through the history of like art and culture that i think you'd probably find out a lot of people
5885680	5890720	were going through something similar you know different and or maybe exactly the same and i
5890800	5898320	think a lot of what was what's benefited humanity is people like turning intense pain into uh like
5898960	5905200	that's what humans uh probably have different than most other animals is that we we take our sadness
5905200	5913680	and we've created art you know so all right hit the showers jeff i'm sorry that offended you it
5913680	5919280	offended me it offended everybody else that's not true they laughed we have showers
5921600	5925760	that that if i hand this pile of things down i don't know what to do with them i have my own

6564800	6569280	you know what i mean yeah no like i said we just opened up pretty recently
6569280	6573200	oh my goodness i could have told told you anyone who's walked through these doors
6573200	6579120	that name definitely not here so here's what i'm going to tell you like this is the point
6579120	6585920	where you either betray yourself to be useless or useful okay if you're useful it's because
6585920	6593200	you're lying if you're useless it's because you're an idiot all right i got a gun in my arm
6594800	6599360	it's going to come out at the speed of light a bullet's going to go through your brain
6599360	6603600	all right there's no technology well i'm sorry what what what what
6603600	6611040	boop up shoot boom shooting you all right let's do a reaction sorry sorry it's it's
6611040	6616720	reflex what are you doing it's what i do it's what i do what are you you had your chance
6617440	6624000	you did terribly you did a terrible job i tried wanting your shot you talk to people you just
6624000	6630480	say garbage what are you doing i shoot people in the head it's my job i'm gonna put a click on oh
6630480	6637040	my god it's all i do it's all i do what is he doing i shoot people in the head oh gosh
6637200	6641760	gosh the minute eyes if needed is the minute you've failed
6643840	6648640	all right well he's okay quick
6657360	6662320	hear the game master what happened yeah i don't get what everyone's laughing at it was funny
6662320	6666160	terris or something funny but i couldn't hear it oh sorry sorry terra jerry what
6670000	6674640	it's fine yeah you can't read you a moment it's just like a perfect shot cutter impression
6674640	6679600	it's like two shot cutter you got nope nope most things don't hear it all regular all right
6679600	6686480	what what happened uh he he falls forward onto the security button what are you doing
6686480	6693280	thing i go through his computer or i guess desk and see if i can find flax on sound obviously i
6693280	6700640	move on sounds yeah because as i just said security would never let that person fall onto
6700640	6708080	a security button uh tell that to the security button well okay so i moved them but i'm just
6708080	6714560	letting you know they moved them what well i moved them what does that mean satan i shot
6714560	6720480	the person they died he fell onto the fell onto the security button i accept that you're allowed
6720480	6727280	to create a security button there was he was pressing it that's why you shot him obviously
6727280	6732240	he didn't fall onto the button he was like no he fell on i'm not crying foul i'm just saying to you
6733360	6739040	i move them off of the security button okay i accept that it's been pressed motor guard can use
6739040	6744240	his uh his uh his detect enemy sense to see if there is some maneuvering going behind the scenes
6744240	6749040	yeah you could definitely you could definitely feel seven or eight seven or eight guards so here's
6749040	6754400	what i proposed and given that i am dressed as a security guard and that my alias would be frank
6754400	6760000	douglas that perhaps that you guys pretend to be uh ghouls i have captured and if they do arrive
6760000	6763920	we use this as some sort of cover such a good idea him should i heal the guy who killed and
6763920	6768240	we just like pretend it's him i don't know if he's uh oh no because he'll know yeah he's had a bad day
6769920	6775360	i don't think he's healable i i honestly if we talk later i'll tell you i regret what i did but
6776560	6781280	in this moment i'm telling you i did my objective was to make him sick beyond healing
6782720	6790800	and i i got i'm not i'm not bragging i yeah i succeeded he's dead i kill people as a matter
6790800	6796880	of urgency this situation can be multi-phasic so that we could do all these things at once for
6796880	6801760	example you could try to heal him at the same time provided that does not work or the door opens
6801760	6808080	sooner he's dead i could honestly i'm offended by the idea that you can heal this guy when i
6808080	6813280	i do one thing for a living and when i do it it's done like if you could heal him i'm fired
6814800	6819760	i position position myself behind the desk in case like people are coming in to like to uh
6819840	6825760	to overtake us all right what else is in the room it's just a waiting room there's chairs
6825760	6831920	there's a potted plant there's large tv i hide behind the pot of the plant it's not that big
6831920	6837840	but okay i didn't i didn't say it had to be okay guys sure here's the thing we got we got we got
6837840	6843360	we got three minutes what why were we here we gotta find we gotta find peggy hill and get
6843360	6847360	her out of here another gem hill to get to bring her back sure of course she's here i'm sure she's
6847360	6852720	here that's where you operate a smoke grenade flies through the hallway into the waiting room
6852720	6859280	clink clink clink i cast mana barrier over the smoke grenade to uh to make it not uh cover us
6859280	6865520	it takes longer than that to cast a mana barrier well i fucking start all right can i cast physical
6865520	6872160	barrier creates a dome or wall it takes the same amount of time so uh yeah smoke spills out into
6872160	6879120	the room start starting to mist the area but before it gets too thick the barrier goes up
6880000	6887280	starts covering the smoke yep this is doing nothing no no it's not i might suggest for
6887280	6893600	the other gods that they all also fan the smoke and the grid i use my southern belle fan to fan
6893840	6902240	everybody we all do it we all do it this this this isn't helping oh i i i i summon a giant
6902240	6908800	eagle who is also dressed as a southern belle and and the eagle his wings are made out of giant
6908800	6914880	southern belle fans all right to waft the uh smoke away from a lot of ghouls the room is covered in
6914880	6922080	gunfire as it cuts through the area the hallway is ablaze with guns you guys all you're being hit
6922080	6931280	get down you're being hit though oh my dick oh oh fuck oh my dick uh using combat since i have
6931280	6936320	taken invasive action in my high tink behind the counter i also have my armor jacket on oh god
6936320	6946400	give me your armor jacket my dick's all fucked up being at his root scandinavian removes the
6946400	6951760	armor jacket and place it around the pelvis oh god it's like the pain goes right up this
6951760	6958560	side oh fuck do we see target spencer do we see the people now you're being shot you're taking
6958560	6964880	damage despite are these robo guns that run around the thing or like they're just guns gun guns
6965760	6972160	bullets cut into your body oh my fucking everybody except porta guard and his superhuman agility
6972160	6979120	takes four wounds just regular style those can hotel guard yell out to them stop stop yeah can
6979120	6984240	you do something say this i am a security guard i am here for you i have brought to you more meat
6984240	6990080	more flesh more more potential action uh for the profit of this uh organization and you are
6990080	6995600	destroying you're destroying the prime directive of the building for which you were you say those
6995600	7002160	things and then you you see a flashbang grenade whiz into the center of the room that's how is that
7002160	7008080	as i am scandinavian can i summon uh sort of innate football sense and uh appropriate myself
7008080	7013920	to the right all right maybe we'll see about that where's my mana barrier did i ever get that it's
7013920	7018960	covering the grenade i thought right oh cool okay that works all right let me scan with my
7018960	7024160	gym nightblade skills you can't tell me that i out of all these people who knew this was gonna
7024160	7031680	happen you can't tell me i don't see some air vent or egress that i can't there's the front door
7033440	7039920	porta guard nimbly kicks the flashbang moments before it explodes down the hallway you guys
7039920	7045600	avoid taking an eye full of flash nice job i'm saying there's gotta be an air vent
7046560	7056400	in every story there's gotta be an air vent okay there's an air vent i use my grappling hook
7057040	7065120	batman style it's to me it's not about abandoning my friends it's about me i'm gonna save them later
7065760	7072160	so i shoot my grappling hook at the thing that you're saying i saw okay and i'm gonna i'm gonna
7072640	7079440	the objective is to you know as batman would i'm gonna go up up into the air vent you hit the air
7079440	7084960	vent with the grappling hook and you pull the retraction trigger and it just it pulls the grade
7084960	7095280	off as fire continues to spread through the room gunfire not fire fire nice oh god also has a
7095280	7099040	grappling gun no one gets hit by that one though oh the god has a grappling gun perhaps i sacrifice
7099040	7104640	the gun for this purpose and shoot it into the vent all right then taking it and anchoring it
7104640	7111120	underneath the office desk i provide the rope direct ground line from the ground to the thing
7111120	7116080	if they're willing to climb they can climb all right those of you who are willing to climb
7116080	7122560	can climb i know you're wearing dresses i won't look up i'll climb up we should climb you go
7122560	7126320	we're climbing you go first you go first thank you and as we're climbing i want to just make sure
7126320	7132160	that you know that when we're climbing we're doing a lot of this sweeping to make it harder
7132160	7138000	for us to be shot yeah it's i mean serpentine serpent climbing a rope is not a great way to
7138000	7144000	avoid being shot at yeah i don't know if you heard me because sometimes my voice doesn't carry but if
7144000	7151840	you just we're doing do we see who's shooting we're doing that and and it would probably would be
7151840	7157040	harder than that would then be harder than not doing that i i look around to see who's shooting
7157040	7162160	us who is the who's shooting there's security guards they're in this hallway that those
7162160	7166960	grenades were coming out of there they're just posted up on a phalanx just spreading spreading
7167520	7175680	all right i i shoot uh lightning bolts at that at that corridor all right force four force four
7175680	7185520	yeah jesus all right you only yeah no you only hit three of them you hit three of them and they
