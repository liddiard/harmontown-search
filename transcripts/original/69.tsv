0	21000	Hello, welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!
21000	29000	It is my duty and my privilege to announce that Harmentown is now in session.
29000	37000	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmentown, Dan Harmon!
37000	41000	Hello!
42000	49000	Hello!
49000	56000	I was watching a G.I. Joe cartoon over the weekend, Jeff, a classic from the 80s.
56000	71000	And there's an episode of G.I. Joe in which the Joes are transported to a terrible new dimension in a cosmic mix-up.
71000	75000	They are transported to a world where Cobra is in charge.
75000	79000	They have taken over the government of the world.
79000	81000	It's Cobra World.
81000	90000	And for instance, when you buy something...
90000	96000	They figure this out very slowly because the differences are very subtle, which I found profound.
96000	104000	For instance, they go and buy a pack of gum and there's like a Cobra scanner that comes down and scans your retina to make sure you can buy the gum right.
104000	106000	And that you're loyal to Cobra.
106000	115000	And there's a lot of posters on the wall that are a picture of Cobra Commander that says loyalty to Cobra or else!
115000	120000	Which is sort of like totally on the Woody Allen approach to despotism.
120000	123000	It's hard on the sleeve kind of.
123000	128000	But the most interesting thing I thought about Cobra World is they're flying around.
128000	132000	They're going, my God, will you look at the White House? It has a little Cobra on top of it.
132000	137000	Oh no, look at the Washington Monument. It's got a little Cobra on top of it.
137000	148000	And then they go past Mount Rushmore and, my God, Jeff, Mount Rushmore had some of its faces replaced.
148000	150000	Some!
150000	153000	Not Teddy Roosevelt. Not Teddy.
153000	158000	Yes, Teddy Roosevelt's face replaced with Destro.
158000	162000	And then I guess Jefferson replaced with Cobra Commander.
162000	166000	By the way, not famous for his face.
166000	170000	I don't know if the sculptor came to him.
170000	172000	Famous for no face.
172000	178000	My face isn't really the thing that's for sale.
178000	183000	That kind of famous more for my lack of face than anything.
183000	185000	But probably easier to sculpt.
185000	189000	Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure the sculptor was like slam dunk.
189000	193000	But I just thought that George Washington and Abe Lincoln's still up there.
193000	196000	It's not like I'm racist or something.
196000	202000	I mean, I'm still American. I think, I don't know. I still value America.
202000	204000	I think, I think every...
204000	207000	I'm a capitalist for God's sake. I don't want to socialize medicine.
207000	211000	If you get sick, you should have to pay for your medical care.
211000	215000	And slaves should be free.
215000	219000	I think the only reason Teddy Roosevelt's on the monument is because
219000	222000	he was a friend of the sculptor, right?
222000	224000	That was kind of an inside joke.
224000	227000	That's probably what Cobra's big problem with it.
227000	230000	Get this fucking Teddy Roosevelt off of here.
230000	232000	He didn't earn this.
232000	233000	I did.
233000	239000	By having a smooth face.
240000	242000	But yeah, the world seemed...
242000	244000	That was the elephant in the room.
244000	247000	G.I. Joe were terrorists because they were in a world
247000	249000	where Cobra was the establishment.
249000	252000	But pretty much the same behavior occurring.
252000	255000	Just people shooting at each other with lasers.
255000	260000	All right, so there's a new thing for the moon colony.
260000	263000	All right.
263000	267000	I love that we've returned to our premise after all these years.
267000	269000	Okay, we don't...
269000	274000	The jury's still out on whether or not there will be restaurants on the moon.
274000	276000	There has to be restaurants.
276000	279000	One for Jeff. VIP moon.
279000	282000	VIP moon's going to have great restaurants.
282000	285000	Actually, I was thinking about making the moon a shock and a friend,
285000	291000	and my little VIP moon is just going to be a taco truck.
291000	292000	Here is...
292000	294000	Because I cannot enact this legislation on the earth,
294000	296000	that's the only reason I'm bringing up the moon.
296000	300000	Because I have no control over what goes down here.
300000	305000	But I would like to make this suggestion to the wait staff of America.
305000	308000	I think that when you come up to the table,
308000	311000	and it's time to clear the plates away,
311000	317000	and when you see that a plate has been cleared by the diner,
317000	319000	like, lift clean, you know,
319000	321000	I know that the overwhelming temptation,
321000	323000	that you've learned this from other waiters
323000	326000	and then learned it from your behavior at the table,
326000	329000	I know that you want to do the hilarious,
329000	332000	looks like you didn't like it bit.
332000	334000	Looks like you hated it.
334000	336000	Looks like you hated it.
336000	339000	I think we have to stop. Stop it.
339000	341000	It doesn't...
341000	345000	It's a cancerous joke.
345000	351000	It takes in joy and it creates discomfort.
351000	353000	There's no...
353000	359000	You think you're misperceiving people's nervous chuckles as joy.
359000	362000	You might as well just go up to people and go like,
362000	364000	whoa, whoa, what do you hate me or something?
364000	367000	And make them go, no!
367000	369000	That sound...
369000	371000	That's not happiness, that sound.
371000	374000	That's like, oh God, Jesus Christ, this person's making me uncomfortable.
374000	376000	Like, it's just sort of like...
376000	379000	What do you want? Just go away.
379000	381000	It looks like you didn't like your food.
381000	383000	No, I did. That's why I ate all...
383000	387000	I ate all the food.
387000	389000	I did like it. I liked it so much.
389000	391000	I opposite hated it.
391000	393000	That's why you said that.
393000	395000	Here's your money.
395000	397000	It's just...
397000	400000	The worst case scenario is it makes you feel fat,
400000	402000	like the person you're talking to.
402000	407000	And the best case scenario is just kind of just nervousness.
407000	410000	Just confusion and anxiety.
410000	413000	So stop it if you can down here,
413000	416000	but on Earth, on the moon, that will not be allowed.
416000	418000	And that may be the reason why there cannot be restaurants.
418000	421000	That and close-up magic.
421000	424000	No fucking close-up magic.
424000	428000	Well, restaurants bring a lot of society's pains on...
428000	431000	If you eliminate restaurants, there's not going to be close-up magicians.
431000	434000	I don't like magic. We've talked about this a number of times.
434000	436000	Fuck magicians.
437000	439000	Magic is lies.
439000	441000	It's just somebody lying to you.
441000	443000	It's not a trick.
443000	445000	A magic trick is just a lie.
445000	448000	And magicians, I'm sure I'm repeating myself,
448000	450000	but when a magician goes...
450000	452000	If someone does a card trick, I go,
452000	454000	wow, how'd you do that?
454000	456000	I can't tell you, man.
456000	458000	I can't tell you because that's part of the magician's code.
458000	461000	But the reason why they can't tell you is because if they told you,
461000	463000	you're a magician.
463000	467000	Magicians, if you knew the fucking stupid fucking trick,
467000	471000	you'd have to wear a vest and stink and be named Dave.
471000	473000	I don't know.
473000	475000	I'm thinking of one guy.
478000	481000	However, I went to the fucking Magic Castle against my will
481000	483000	and against all fucking better judgment
483000	486000	because the Magic Castle, as I said before, is a bummer
486000	488000	and it smells like poo.
488000	491000	But I went there and I was brought up on stage by the...
491000	494000	I wasn't the close-up stage, it was like the medium-sized stage.
494000	496000	And the guy saw me in my suit and goes,
496000	498000	you, did I talk about this on the show already?
498000	499000	Yeah.
499000	500000	I did?
500000	502000	All right, go fuck yourselves.
502000	505000	He brought me up on stage because he thought I would be skeptical
505000	507000	and he proceeded to blow my mind.
507000	510000	He needed me up on stage to prove to the audience that, like, fucking...
510000	512000	It was really magical.
512000	514000	You mean you had to, like, cut a rope or...?
514000	515000	No, he dropped coins.
515000	517000	He kept dropping metal coins into my hand
517000	519000	and then when he would close my hand and I would see it,
519000	522000	three, four coins go into my hand, big, loud metal coins,
522000	524000	he would close my fist
524000	527000	and he would say, how many coins are in your hand?
527000	529000	In front of 45 people.
529000	531000	And I would say, well, four.
531000	534000	And he'd open my hand and there would be a rubber ball in my hand.
534000	536000	And it was fucking magic.
536000	537000	Right.
537000	539000	So I'd take everything back.
539000	541000	So you like, all right, all right.
541000	544000	It has to be real magic, otherwise.
544000	546000	It had to be.
546000	547000	It had to be real.
547000	548000	Still, fuck him.
548000	550000	And also, he smelled like mildew.
550000	553000	It smells like a grandpa's sleeping bag there.
553000	555000	The one that died in his sleeping bag.
555000	559000	How about the magic trick of make the smell disappear?
559000	561000	Yeah, that would be quite a trick.
561000	563000	Fuck the ghost at the piano.
563000	566000	Take a magic bath, people.
568000	571000	I stop myself halfway through there because I'm, what have I become?
571000	574000	Yeah, you're the guy that hates being told to take a bath.
574000	576000	A magic castle should be my people.
577000	580000	If I knew how to lie better, I would, I should just be there instead of the moon.
580000	586000	I should be just saying abracadabra and hanging out in my dumb hat.
589000	593000	You ever get scared bagging on magicians that, you know, you'll come home
593000	596000	and your bed will be just about half.
598000	600000	I live in mortal fear of that.
601000	603000	That would just be like...
603000	606000	Does anybody really like magic?
606000	610000	I mean, you just said yourself, you described an experience that was well done.
610000	612000	But I didn't have fun.
612000	614000	I was like, oh, you're faking me out.
614000	616000	You're doing it like it's just lies.
616000	617000	I get very nervous.
617000	621000	In regular conversations, let alone conversations where I'm being asked questions,
621000	625000	told what to do, afraid I'm going to do it wrong.
626000	632000	The few times that I've been engaged by a magician have caused me such anxiety
632000	638000	that I think I exude a force field that magicians don't pick me and stuff
638000	642000	because I just get so nervous in those things when people go like,
642000	644000	I don't want to put this in your hand.
644000	646000	Nope, nope, nope, to the other left hand.
649000	652000	I'm surprised that somebody actually, a recent waiter, a waitress,
652000	656000	gave you the, looks like you didn't like it, bit.
656000	658000	That was this weekend that happened.
658000	661000	The guy at Umami Burger, a hipster burger place in Hollywood.
661000	667000	Still, his mustache was waxed, he was wearing, you know,
667000	671000	half a strap of an overall, whatever the fuck the kids are doing these days.
671000	675000	A henna tattoo of Pokemon on his face, I don't know.
675000	678000	Whatever, he was a hologram.
679000	683000	But still, saw the crumbs and just like the 45-year-old
683000	686000	Midwestern diner waitress in him just jumped out.
686000	688000	Guess you didn't like it very much.
693000	697000	No, I did. I swear. Why are we fighting?
699000	704000	What is the instinct to be sarcastic in a moment that should just be celebrated?
704000	709000	Oh wow, you loved the mac and cheese, it's gone, it's in your, it's in your poo poos.
709000	714000	Good, good boy. Clean plate club.
714000	716000	Just, just be nice in that moment.
716000	721000	You don't have to be Willy Wonka, you don't have to fucking stretch my boundaries.
721000	724000	Teach me that truth is relative.
724000	731000	You're not a fucking like, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not Mad Bartigan.
732000	734000	Are you comparing him to Willow?
734000	737000	I don't know why that name leapt into my head.
737000	740000	Oh, because I miss Erin, that's why. She's in Chicago.
740000	744000	Thanks guys, that was, that was heartfelt.
744000	750000	She's in Chicago doing like these shows and stuff and it's like two days without her and I'm just a wreck.
750000	751000	Why is that?
751000	757000	I just, I guess, either the healthiest answer, because I love her,
757000	762000	I'm unhealthy, I'm an emotional vampire and I was feeding off of her, I don't know.
762000	767000	In either case, she was, she was integral to my, to my happiness.
767000	769000	Are you guys going to get married?
769000	777000	Well, you know, I don't know if you understand how marriage works, but typically you're not supposed to give that much of a heads up.
777000	787000	If I said yes, then, and then when I, when I, when I proposed to her, she's going to say finally, instead of yes.
787000	790000	You're being extra weird about it for no reason.
790000	794000	You guys haven't discussed this, it's not, it's not a discussion that you guys have had?
794000	802000	I think there's a, I think she knows that I want to be with her forever and stuff, but you know, you know that there's a, there's a, there's a,
802000	809000	it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's a tackiness to, you know, pointing at the bleachers.
809000	817000	Why don't you, why don't you be the first person to propose to her a podcast that will come out two days from now?
817000	824000	And you can like, like, put a ring on her iPhone and like, I don't know, because that, that will be her moment.
824000	835000	I don't want to, I don't want to be one of those guys that embarrasses the, the, the, the proposal, you know, I want to, I want to do it regular style.
835000	836000	You're going to do it.
836000	852000	Well, I, I, I have no plans to, uh, to, yeah, I, I, I, I, I, I'm not breaking up with her and I'm not dying.
852000	855000	Ergo, marriage is imminent.
855000	857000	Ergo, will you marry me?
857000	861000	I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's just, isn't there some magic?
861000	864000	Hey, hey, sorry I brought it up.
864000	868000	You don't have to marry her. No, no one's making you marry her.
868000	874000	If I, if I asked you if you were going to marry your girlfriend, you know that the, you know what that would, the spot that you would be put on.
874000	879000	You'd have to, that's a yes or no question to something that you're not supposed to talk about that stuff.
879000	880000	Why not?
881000	884000	Okay, uh, Jeff, are you going to marry the girlfriend that you're with right now?
884000	885000	No.
896000	897000	Are you?
899000	900000	Yes.
900000	901000	Yes.
908000	912000	Although this, I made that decision before I found out yours was going to be available.
919000	920000	She's a delight.
921000	923000	Uh, all right. Yes, yes.
923000	924000	I miss Erin.
924000	925000	And yes, one day.
925000	926000	Yes.
926000	928000	I'll make an honest woman out of her.
929000	932000	She's a, where's that, where's that expression come from?
932000	946000	I guess I, I guess I, I guess that's like the idea that you're making a woman dishonest by just like, uh, I guess that hails back to a time when, uh, when sex was, uh, a criminal act like out of wedlock.
946000	952000	Like you had to, if you were having sex with somebody and they weren't married to them, then they had to lie to the, uh, gas station attendant.
953000	961000	Where would you, uh, I'm sure Erin's, I know Erin enough to know she's the kind of person that probably has ideas about what her ideal wedding would be.
961000	964000	But if you like, like, where would you like to be married?
964000	967000	Like in like the best of all possible worlds?
967000	979000	I, I, I would start that conversation by acknowledging that I think the ceremonies are more for the, for the people, you know, like, cause you could take somebody and stand under a waterfall and, or go to city hall.
979000	981000	I think Kumail and Emily went to city hall, didn't they?
981000	983000	Maybe they had a ceremony later for friends.
983000	995000	But, but, but like the, the couple, you know, there's a, marrying somebody would make a warehouse full of dead rats a romantic, uh, for those two people.
995000	1000000	But for the people that you're inviting, you want to make sure that they're having a good time.
1000000	1018000	And to that effect, I would like to do a Raiders in the Lost art, uh, themed wedding where, where the audience was, was not only, uh, allowed to, but really required to help, uh, save our marriage from, uh, Destro, I don't know.
1018000	1020000	Are you two going to be tied to a stake?
1020000	1021000	Yeah.
1021000	1023000	And when they, when the ring comes out, you're going to say, don't look at it.
1023000	1025000	Yeah, yeah.
1025000	1026000	Yeah.
1026000	1034000	She will be a melting Nazi ceremonial garb and he'll, he'll, he'll open.
1034000	1037000	We'll get married by Bellac.
1037000	1040000	Well, all of the attendees have to dress like Nazis too.
1040000	1045000	I think that was a Nazi heavy ceremony in Raiders in the Lost art.
1045000	1046000	What are you doing?
1046000	1049000	Aaron's texting me.
1049000	1053000	It's like she knows the show is going on.
1053000	1056000	Why did she, why did she text me?
1056000	1063000	No, cause it, she said yes.
1063000	1069000	That means Adam Goldberg is texting her and she's saying I do right now.
1069000	1071000	No, no, she doesn't.
1071000	1073000	She's just, uh, wait, she said, I don't know.
1073000	1078000	She said, I think she's at, she's at some hip hop show and then she said, she sent me all texts, all caps.
1078000	1081000	Ah, an MC just dropped your name.
1081000	1088000	Ah, ah, and then the, and then a follow up text in reference to community.
1088000	1093000	Like it would be a reference to my world famous carrot cake recipe.
1093000	1097000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, before we get started, I want to give a big shout out to Dan.
1097000	1102000	He puts the right amount of cinnamon in that carrot cake.
1102000	1104000	He's out there keeping it real.
1104000	1107000	Not too much carrot.
1107000	1109000	I assume is the secret.
1109000	1114000	It's a cake, not a salad.
1114000	1118000	Did you know that, uh, uh, Harman town is a feral audio podcast, Jeff.
1118000	1120000	I was unfamiliar with that concept.
1120000	1127000	Uh, you can go to feral audio.com and hear what some of the most amazing people in the world, like for instance,
1127000	1131000	Duncan trestle or, uh, Aaron McGathey or Chelsea Perretti.
1131000	1132000	Why is it called feral audio?
1132000	1134000	Was it, was it raised in the wilderness?
1134000	1138000	Uh, was it, was it real audio, but they didn't have parents and was raised in the streets?
1138000	1139000	Yeah.
1139000	1144000	I think it's like, uh, like you look at Dustin, you know, Dustin sort of is feral audio and he's,
1144000	1151000	he's like a live, uh, kind of stringy, uh, street cat.
1151000	1155000	I always assumed it was sort of his totem that he was like a, he's like an alley cat.
1155000	1166000	He's a little, he's a little, little, little scrapper.
1166000	1167000	He's easy.
1167000	1168000	He's easy.
1168000	1169000	He's easy.
1169000	1171000	And if he scratches you, you get sick.
1171000	1172000	Is that true?
1172000	1173000	Dustin?
1173000	1174000	Oh yeah.
1174000	1175000	You ever get scratched by him?
1175000	1176000	Yeah.
1176000	1177000	Just last night.
1177000	1178000	I don't feel so well.
1178000	1179000	Yeah.
1179000	1180000	Yeah.
1180000	1181000	It's bad news.
1181000	1183000	Uh, yeah, no, but that's, that's, that's the plug for this week is just go.
1183000	1184000	It's a network.
1184000	1188000	Go to feralaudio.com and I'm, I'm, I'm not kidding.
1188000	1192000	I mean, if we were, if I wouldn't see this about Pringles, even if they were giving us
1192000	1196000	money, which is why they won't, uh, I mean, cause I would be like, well, I would say Pringles
1196000	1198000	are delicious, but they're probably bad for you.
1198000	1201000	I wrote them the best jingle of all time and nothing.
1201000	1202000	Yeah.
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1203000	1204000	Yeah.
1204000	1205000	Uh, what'd you say?
1205000	1206000	Nike.
1206000	1207000	Nike.
1207000	1208000	Yeah.
1208000	1210000	Somebody just brought me some Adam Goldberg.
1211000	1215000	Brought me a weird laser stacks.
1216000	1217000	Kiss canister.
1217000	1219000	Speaking of food at the show.
1219000	1220000	Thank you.
1220000	1221000	Where's Bill?
1221000	1222000	I don't see Bill.
1222000	1223000	Bill's not here.
1223000	1224000	Beef fungus.
1224000	1225000	Bill got a taste of his own beef fungus.
1225000	1231000	And Adam, why did you give me alternative Pringles?
1231000	1233000	Seems right in the moment.
1233000	1235000	Seemed right in the moment.
1235000	1236000	He's a dot connector.
1236000	1237000	Adam connects dots.
1237000	1238000	He said Pringles.
1238000	1239000	He had a cylinder in his hands.
1240000	1241000	Wait, they're half eaten.
1244000	1245000	Kind of bullshit.
1246000	1248000	Should we just get a Goldberg update?
1248000	1249000	Just bring Adam up here with him.
1249000	1251000	Goldberg update.
1258000	1259000	No, no, no.
1259000	1260000	You like a laser stack, Dan?
1260000	1262000	Are they baked or what is the...
1262000	1263000	Probably.
1263000	1264000	I am.
1264000	1265000	Ah, drugs.
1265000	1266000	Okay.
1267000	1269000	So that's great about Aaron.
1269000	1272000	It's really cool that MC dropped your name.
1272000	1273000	Ah.
1274000	1275000	Ah, that's...
1275000	1276000	No back brace?
1276000	1278000	No, I'm doing pretty well on that, actually.
1278000	1279000	What's going on with your back?
1283000	1286000	I'm only going to answer questions while eating delicious
1286000	1288000	laser stacks available in cheddar.
1288000	1290000	From the dollar store of Pasadena.
1290000	1291000	These better be good for you.
1291000	1292000	These suck.
1297000	1300000	My back brace is awesome.
1300000	1303000	Most important thing to know about my back brace.
1304000	1306000	Yeah, these are delicious.
1306000	1307000	Are you on something?
1307000	1308000	No.
1308000	1309000	You said drugs.
1309000	1310000	Yeah, I did, didn't I?
1310000	1313000	No, it's just a delicious flavor of laser...
1313000	1314000	You're right.
1314000	1315000	These just don't...
1315000	1316000	You're high as fuck right now.
1317000	1323000	Adam, your family listens to this podcast.
1324000	1328000	My brother asked if there are any extra XL t-shirts.
1328000	1332000	You don't have to say yes, but this does count as me asking on the record.
1332000	1333000	Fuck that guy.
1333000	1334000	Yeah, fair enough.
1335000	1338000	And my back has been slowly recovering due to physical therapy,
1338000	1340000	but now that I'm back to lifting...
1340000	1341000	Thank you.
1341000	1343000	One person applauded and they're the best person.
1344000	1345000	It's your physical therapist.
1347000	1348000	It's work, yeah.
1348000	1349000	Woo, dying art!
1351000	1352000	No, I'm doing pretty much better.
1352000	1356000	I was lifting a bunch of boxes for a Christian film this weekend.
1356000	1357000	Yeah, and I met...
1357000	1360000	Actually, I met a fan of the podcast on the film,
1360000	1362000	and he's much more interesting than I am.
1362000	1365000	And I'd like to invite Jay to the stage because I'm doing terrible.
1365000	1371000	It is not your fucking privilege to invite people to the stage.
1372000	1374000	That's not how that works.
1377000	1381000	What if I sweeten the deal with some delicious Lay's Stacks available in check?
1381000	1384000	From the Pasadena 99 Center?
1384000	1385000	This time you've gone too far.
1385000	1386000	Okay.
1388000	1392000	Damn, why don't we just sit out in the audience and let Adam do the rest of the show?
1392000	1395000	That would be a bad idea, and let's do it.
1395000	1398000	Give us the headline on what makes him so interesting.
1398000	1401000	Well, Lay's Stacks are the ultimate way to recharge.
1401000	1404000	And it says Lay's Stacks and there's not enough room,
1404000	1407000	there's a copyright symbol, and it says brand underneath it.
1407000	1411000	So please do not use Lay's Stacks, all capitals,
1411000	1415000	in a way that the Frito-Lay Corporation would dislike
1415000	1418000	because they are a registered brand.
1418000	1421000	Cheddar Flavored Potato Crisps give you the full flavor.
1421000	1422000	What is going on?
1422000	1424000	Are you Crispin Glover now?
1424000	1426000	Are you going to start karate kicking?
1426000	1429000	You're reading a potato chip label.
1429000	1431000	I really want to punt these into the audience,
1431000	1434000	but the first three words will suffer more than they are now.
1435000	1437000	You've gone mad with...
1437000	1441000	I've gone mad with delicious cheddar flavor.
1441000	1444000	In 9% of my daily sodium, I'm done.
1444000	1445000	That's about it.
1445000	1447000	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1455000	1457000	What just happened?
1457000	1459000	Maybe he's on Painkillers or something.
1459000	1461000	That's why his back brace is on?
1461000	1463000	That's PCP. He's on PCP.
1464000	1466000	Is that dust? Is that angel dust?
1466000	1467000	Angel dust.
1467000	1468000	Is that what angel dust is?
1468000	1469000	Yeah.
1469000	1470000	PCP? What is PCP?
1470000	1471000	It's like...
1471000	1472000	It's angel dust.
1473000	1474000	Well, this is...
1474000	1476000	I mean, this is conversations going in circles.
1476000	1478000	Is it like a...
1478000	1479000	PCP is...
1479000	1480000	The only time...
1480000	1486000	I've seen people on PCP, and it is a intense, like...
1486000	1487000	I'm not sure what the original purpose was.
1487000	1490000	I think it was like a horse tranquilizer or some crazy shit.
1490000	1492000	And friends of mine accidentally have done it,
1492000	1495000	and I've seen them, and they thought they could do anything.
1495000	1497000	And they really just go berserk.
1497000	1501000	And, like, you really do think you could punch your fist through a wall,
1501000	1502000	so you try it.
1502000	1504000	And then there was that bath salts thing
1504000	1507000	that made you think that you would like to eat a face.
1508000	1509000	What?
1509000	1511000	Yeah, you don't even know.
1511000	1512000	Bath salts?
1512000	1518000	For a little while there, there was a spate of human-on-human murder...
1518000	1521000	cannibalism happening on this drug...
1521000	1527000	I thought it was actually people snorting the product called bath salts,
1527000	1530000	like the actual bath salts that someone had figured out
1530000	1533000	that you could snort that and get high,
1533000	1535000	but it was also making you eat faces.
1535000	1536000	But I think it's...
1536000	1538000	Isn't it just a drug you kids are taking?
1539000	1541000	What is the active ingredient in the bath salts?
1541000	1543000	It's basically...
1543000	1547000	It's chemically equal to something like a illegal substance,
1547000	1550000	but they basically use different ingredients and methods to get around it,
1550000	1553000	so they were selling basically what equivalent to, like,
1553000	1558000	something like a PCB in, like, legal form in packets of stores.
1558000	1559000	It's basically meth.
1559000	1560000	Yeah, it's meth.
1560000	1561000	It's meth.
1561000	1563000	And you take a bath in it?
1564000	1565000	Bath salts?
1565000	1566000	Oh, okay.
1566000	1569000	But there's a special ingredient, human face,
1569000	1572000	and once you get a taste for it, you...
1572000	1575000	Is somebody else talking out there?
1576000	1578000	Did somebody just take a phone call,
1578000	1581000	or was somebody, like, loaded with information about bath salts?
1581000	1584000	Because if you are, you could tell us.
1584000	1586000	All right, well, enough about...
1586000	1587000	We talked about drugs.
1587000	1589000	We talked about Cobra Commander.
1590000	1592000	We talked about rock and roll.
1592000	1594000	Why don't we bring Spencer up?
1594000	1595000	Fuck yeah, why not?
1605000	1606000	Hello, Spencer.
1607000	1608000	Hey, hey, hey.
1608000	1611000	Spencer, is it just me or is your beard becoming more and more majestic
1611000	1612000	as time goes by?
1613000	1617000	Long time fans may know that my beard increases in length
1617000	1619000	every time I get more Twitter followers.
1623000	1624000	Having a beard's weird.
1624000	1626000	Do you like having a beard, Dan?
1626000	1629000	Only if I'm able to keep it clean.
1629000	1630000	Yeah.
1630000	1632000	Yeah, otherwise it gets very itchy.
1632000	1635000	I find that people, people take...
1635000	1638000	I mean, having a beard is...
1638000	1641000	It's a lot like having, like, a comment section on your face.
1643000	1645000	People just feel free to say anything.
1645000	1647000	They're like, oh, man, how long have you been growing that?
1647000	1648000	I mean, that's fine.
1648000	1650000	Or like, oh, when are you planning on cutting that?
1650000	1654000	Or this old guy's like, I'll give you $50 to cut that right now,
1654000	1656000	or someone's like, fuck you.
1658000	1659000	Yeah, yeah.
1659000	1661000	Yeah, and it is kind of unwarranted
1661000	1663000	because it's not like you did anything special.
1663000	1664000	You really just let it grow.
1664000	1665000	It's like...
1665000	1667000	I did less than everybody else.
1668000	1671000	My question is, but there's no answer to this except biology.
1671000	1673000	Like, how do you get it to be so long?
1673000	1675000	I don't think I'm capable of doing that.
1675000	1677000	Yeah, well, what was that movie?
1677000	1681000	In the movie Knocked Up, were they making fun of a guy for growing a beard?
1681000	1682000	Can't remember.
1682000	1683000	Yeah, it's like that.
1683000	1686000	Like, there's this phase that's terrible.
1686000	1690000	I think it's just long enough so it curls back and is stabbing into your face
1690000	1692000	and that's what makes it all itchy.
1692000	1696000	Once you get past that, it kind of just bursts forth in majesty.
1697000	1699000	Do you really think that if I just never trimmed my beard
1699000	1702000	that it would ever acquire length like that?
1702000	1705000	Yeah, when I was in like middle school and high school and stuff,
1705000	1708000	people would tell me that I missed some spots shaving
1708000	1713000	when I just didn't shave because it only came in like two spots on my face.
1713000	1717000	But eventually, if you don't shave it, it'll start filling out and stuff.
1717000	1720000	I think it's just that everything grows at a different rate.
1720000	1723000	So if you're shaving your whole face, it'll only be patchy.
1723000	1725000	But if you let it grow long enough, you know.
1725000	1728000	Dan, do you not trim your beard? You don't curtail that?
1728000	1730000	It stops at that length?
1730000	1734000	I usually end up trimming it, but I feel like if I don't trim it,
1734000	1737000	all that happens is it just sort of like, as I've said,
1737000	1739000	it just kind of Galifianacuses.
1739000	1745000	It just kind of gets bushier, but it doesn't really take on this cascading,
1745000	1748000	beautiful waterfall of manhood.
1748000	1750000	I don't know. I think the bushy look is a lot better.
1750000	1752000	This just looks really weird.
1752000	1754000	Well, I'm just saying.
1754000	1758000	I don't know if everyone automatically has the ability to zeezy top it.
1758000	1762000	I think some of us, I would just look more and more like
1762000	1766000	there was a donut of hair around my head.
1766000	1770000	I would just end up being like this weird Dick Tracy character.
1770000	1773000	Donut head.
1773000	1775000	I'm taking Dick Tracy out of the headlines.
1775000	1777000	I'm rubbing them out. Easy donut head.
1777000	1780000	Just keep playing poker.
1780000	1783000	Hey, little face. Yeah, donut head?
1783000	1787000	What's the difference between us?
1787000	1790000	I have a tiny face surrounded by a head.
1790000	1793000	You have a regular head surrounded by a bunch of hair.
1793000	1797000	Why am I explaining this to you?
1797000	1801000	Because I'm donut head. I'm not too bright.
1801000	1804000	I got involved in organized crime not because it was my passion.
1804000	1806000	It was because I had no other options.
1806000	1809000	I lacked the aptitude for other occupations.
1809000	1813000	Come on, donut head. Don't be so hard on yourself.
1813000	1815000	You get the tiny little face.
1815000	1817000	It's like you're born to be a gangster.
1817000	1821000	You being sarcastic? No.
1821000	1824000	I pick up on that shit, you see.
1824000	1826000	Let's get Dick Tracy.
1826000	1828000	All right, little face.
1828000	1834000	Later.
1834000	1836000	Why do you keep your bread in the freezer?
1836000	1839000	What are you doing in my apartment?
1839000	1841000	Who keeps bread in the freezer?
1841000	1844000	You want a sandwich and now you go to the freezer and the bread's fucking frozen.
1844000	1845000	What are you going to...
1845000	1847000	You know you need a sandwich a half hour before?
1847000	1849000	Meanwhile...
1849000	1854000	I want my face to be brought to the left.
1854000	1855000	Oh, but the Cobra Commander.
1855000	1859000	That would have replaced Mr. Roosevelt.
1859000	1860000	I don't care.
1860000	1863000	I heard he didn't even do anything to be on this mountain.
1863000	1866000	Also, gee, I chose. Terrible. I hate them.
1866000	1870000	Later.
1870000	1876000	Stacy, move those shoes.
1876000	1883000	You found the bottom of my improv hopper.
1883000	1888000	I wanted that to go on for the rest of my life.
1888000	1893000	I wanted to just keep saying meanwhile and later and that would go on forever.
1893000	1894000	Yeah.
1894000	1896000	That got bad pretty quick, didn't it?
1896000	1899000	Didn't even start that good.
1899000	1905000	Just looking at my Evernote, back to Evernote.
1905000	1906000	All right.
1906000	1908000	I let the waiters have it, right?
1908000	1911000	Just don't do that.
1911000	1912000	What do you mean why not?
1912000	1914000	Who said that?
1914000	1916000	Are you a waitress?
1916000	1918000	Come up on stage and get a microphone.
1918000	1921000	If you want, if you want.
1921000	1922000	What's your name?
1922000	1923000	Lissette.
1923000	1924000	Hello, Lissette.
1924000	1925000	All right.
1925000	1927000	Can we re-pipe some of that now that you're...
1927000	1928000	Maybe we'll edit out the...
1928000	1929000	So you are a wait person.
1929000	1930000	I was.
1930000	1931000	Who has taken the stage.
1931000	1935000	You were a wait person for seven years, which you said?
1935000	1941000	Six years from numerous restaurants around the L.A. county that have no need for me.
1941000	1942000	So there you go.
1942000	1943000	Okay.
1943000	1949000	And what you were saying is that you learned from wait people.
1949000	1950000	Yeah.
1950000	1951000	Well, it's like, okay.
1951000	1952000	You finish your pie.
1952000	1953000	I'm like, oh.
1953000	1954000	Okay.
1954000	1955000	Finish your pie.
1955000	1956000	You look like you really like it there, right?
1956000	1957000	That's what they say, you know.
1957000	1958000	Well, no.
1958000	1959000	They say it looks like you hated it.
1959000	1960000	Right.
1960000	1961000	Whatever.
1961000	1962000	Well, what you say...
1962000	1963000	You know what I mean.
1963000	1964000	I'm sorry.
1964000	1965000	I'm sorry.
1965000	1967000	Well, I mean, but what you said I want to point out is actually kind of a...
1967000	1968000	I mean, that wouldn't be half as bad.
1968000	1969000	Yeah.
1969000	1970000	I would say...
1970000	1971000	You said, oh, you really liked it.
1971000	1972000	Thank you.
1972000	1975720	But I'm saying I've worked with people that have said that, and I, as a waitress, when
1975720	1979800	I've gone out to eat, they've told me that, oh, it looks like you hated it.
1979800	1980800	And you don't like that, do you?
1980800	1985280	And I didn't like it, but I've had friends that have been with me while it's been said
1985280	1988000	to me that, and here's what you do.
1988000	1991840	The next time they tell you that, you say, yeah, it sucked.
1991840	1992840	You say that.
1992840	1993840	You say that.
1993840	1994840	And then they're kind of confused.
1994840	1995840	They're like, but if you...
1995840	1996840	Like, for example, if you...
1996840	1997840	Why'd you eat it?
1998680	2000560	If it sucked, why'd you eat it all?
2000560	2004320	And you're like, you could say, well, because I couldn't order anything else because you
2004320	2007600	were too lazy to come back for me to change my order.
2007600	2012360	And I swear to God, that will make them feel worse because the way your servers don't...
2012360	2016720	So in telling them you murdered their parents, I mean, like, when it comes to a certain point
2016720	2018760	where it's just like, what is our goal here as a society?
2018760	2022840	Is it just to poison each other's brains and souls?
2022840	2023840	Yes.
2023840	2024840	No.
2024840	2028320	I'm just saying, if you want to make them feel bad, because they've been...
2028320	2029320	They've told me that before.
2029320	2030320	Well, okay.
2030320	2031320	Here's the thing.
2031320	2033280	I used to work at Johnny Rockets, and Johnny Rockets has apple pie.
2033280	2035200	They have apple pie with cheddar cheese on it.
2035200	2036480	I don't recommend it.
2036480	2037480	You should go to...
2037480	2038480	Pans is better.
2038480	2044040	Anyway, you order that, and some people would be like, well, yeah, the pie was too burnt.
2044040	2046040	And I'm like, well, why'd you finish it?
2046040	2047400	And they're like, well, because I was hungry.
2047400	2048400	And then they still...
2048400	2053080	What's even tackier is when they ask for a refund on something that they ate in completion.
2053080	2056080	But if you want to make them feel bad, ask for a refund.
2056080	2058880	You don't necessarily have to get it, but you'll definitely put the server in their place.
2058880	2059880	All right.
2059880	2060880	Well, all right.
2060880	2061880	I'm just saying.
2061880	2063360	Lizette, did you work at one of the Johnny Rockets where you had to get up on the counter
2063360	2064640	and sing and dance and stuff?
2064640	2065640	That's ed to business.
2065640	2066640	Yes, it was the...
2066640	2067640	Oh, oh.
2067640	2068640	Yeah.
2068640	2069640	There are Johnny Rockets.
2069640	2070640	If they play YMCA, you have to get up and do the...
2070640	2071640	Or Respect by Aretha Franklin.
2071640	2072640	Yeah, by Aretha Franklin.
2072640	2073640	Did you have to do that?
2073640	2074640	Oh, it was very...
2074640	2075640	Yeah.
2075640	2076640	It wasn't my better day.
2076640	2078640	Can we see a little diversion of it?
2078640	2079640	No, thank you.
2079640	2081640	She just said it was horrible.
2082520	2086360	I mean, she's comfortable making people feel worse about things.
2086360	2091200	No, I'm just saying, I've been a server and I've, you know...
2091200	2092200	Whatchu want?
2092200	2093200	Anything.
2093200	2094200	I got it.
2094200	2098280	Is that like the sound of an alarm clock at a movie or are you going like, ahh?
2098280	2100840	I still like that song regardless that I had to dance to it.
2100840	2101840	Really?
2101840	2102840	Wow.
2102840	2103840	But I'm just saying, yeah.
2103840	2104840	It's not that I'm trying to make a server feel bad.
2104840	2105840	I'm just saying.
2105840	2106840	There's two kinds of servers.
2106840	2108800	They're dicks and then they're nice people.
2108800	2109800	They're nice people.
2109800	2110800	Yeah, basically.
2110960	2111960	Nice people.
2111960	2112960	Dicks and nice people.
2112960	2113960	I was like, holy shit.
2113960	2114960	This is going to a...
2114960	2115960	I said nice.
2115960	2116960	I know.
2116960	2117960	I know.
2117960	2119960	Originally, when you said that though, I thought, wow.
2119960	2124520	Look, as everyone has gone out to eat in the city, I'm pretty sure we all come across the
2124520	2129040	narcissistic waiter and then there's, you know, the overtly nice people.
2129040	2131240	I was one of the waitresses that was super nice.
2131240	2133080	That's why I never got fired right away.
2133080	2134080	But...
2134080	2137400	You got fired for embezzling later on down the road?
2137520	2141520	No, I once got fired for telling someone that they were inadvertently fat.
2141520	2142520	I didn't mean to.
2142520	2144520	Wait, you said they were inadvertently fat?
2144520	2145520	No.
2145520	2146520	I didn't say that.
2146520	2147520	Well, it's like, okay.
2147520	2152160	So this lady comes in and she orders a chicken pot pie, right?
2152160	2155240	But prior to ordering it, her friends are like, oh, she just got wisdom teeth.
2155240	2157400	What do you think about the chicken pot pie?
2157400	2159400	I said, it's too heavy for you.
2159400	2160400	I said that.
2160400	2164520	I was referencing texture, but I wasn't smart enough to say, oh, the texture for that is
2164520	2166760	too heavy for your teeth.
2166760	2168520	I just said, oh yeah, that's too heavy.
2168520	2171160	So she equates that with, oh, you're calling me fat.
2171160	2172560	She told my manager, I got fired.
2172560	2173560	Wow.
2173560	2174560	There you go.
2174560	2175560	Holy crap.
2175560	2176560	Yeah.
2176560	2177560	Was she fat?
2177560	2178560	No.
2178560	2179560	She was okay.
2179560	2180560	You know, she wasn't...
2180560	2181560	She was fat.
2181560	2182560	No.
2182560	2187560	She was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.
2187560	2192000	She was a little stocky, but I'm not going to say that.
2192000	2195660	But I'm curious though, because you said it's too heavy for you.
2195660	2200100	It's the for you that made her go, oh, what did you mean by for you?
2200100	2202900	Well, I should have said, no, the texture of chicken pot pie.
2202900	2203900	We've all had it.
2203900	2208740	It's basically mashed potatoes in a pie, come on, and peas and chicken or a shepherd's
2208740	2209740	pie or whatever.
2209740	2210740	But you were saying for her.
2210740	2211740	Yeah.
2211740	2212740	Why?
2212740	2213740	Well, because she just got wisdom teeth surgery.
2213740	2214740	Oh.
2214740	2215740	Would you want to eat?
2215740	2216740	That's...
2216740	2217740	Why did you know that?
2217740	2218740	She said that?
2218740	2219740	Yeah.
2219740	2220740	Did I not say that earlier?
2220740	2221740	Yeah.
2221740	2222740	Oh, okay.
2222740	2223740	Sorry.
2223740	2224740	Hey, I'm a terrible interviewer.
2224820	2227860	You're probably only a terrible interviewer because you keep telling yourself that you're
2227860	2228860	a terrible interviewer.
2228860	2229860	During the interviews, yeah.
2229860	2230860	Instead of listening.
2230860	2231860	Oh, yeah.
2231860	2233860	Do you ever not interview yourself in the bathtub?
2233860	2234860	You can get better that way.
2234860	2235860	I have...
2235860	2236860	No.
2236860	2241380	You're talking about jerking off, right?
2241380	2243620	You interview yourself in your bathtub?
2243620	2246820	I interview myself all the time with a bathtub.
2246820	2250820	You never fantasize about being on David Letterman or like that kind of thing or Barbara Walters
2250820	2252780	and having them tell you specific questions.
2252820	2256820	I think maybe when I was a lot younger, yeah, I would have fantasies about being on a panel.
2256820	2260540	Let's say that you were on Letterman Tonight or Conan.
2260540	2262340	Do you have a Conan or Letterman Story?
2262340	2265740	What would be your go-to anecdote that you would say?
2265740	2267580	I don't know.
2267580	2268580	It depends on...
2268580	2269580	I don't know.
2269580	2270580	I have plenty of things, but...
2270580	2273100	You're the one that practices all this shit.
2273100	2274100	You don't have a go-to?
2274100	2275100	Well, what's your...
2275100	2277900	Do you have a fantasy reason why you would be that noteworthy?
2277900	2278900	Well, yeah.
2278900	2281740	I don't want to work at Starbucks for the rest of my life.
2281740	2282740	I know.
2282740	2287900	But, I mean, in your fantasy when you're on Letterman, like, why is Letterman having you
2287900	2288900	on in the fantasy?
2288900	2292100	Is it because of a book you wrote or is it because of a dance you do or...
2292100	2293100	Yeah.
2293100	2294100	I invented the...
2294100	2295100	No.
2295100	2296100	I just...
2296100	2297100	Yeah, I don't know.
2297100	2298100	For whatever reason.
2298100	2299100	For whatever reason.
2299100	2301100	I take over your job.
2301100	2302100	Okay.
2302100	2303100	Well...
2303100	2304100	No, I'm kidding.
2304100	2305100	That I'm just saying.
2305100	2308180	It's going to be the toughest shoes you'll ever fill.
2308180	2311180	You'll have to learn how to not listen to people while you're interviewing them.
2311180	2318900	But, oh, well, I mean, that's interesting to me, though, because so you're fantasizing
2318900	2325220	about being on David Letterman, and he's just going, our next guest is Lisette, and let's
2325220	2326220	bring her out.
2326220	2328620	And you're like, hey!
2328620	2329620	And he's like, so...
2329620	2333700	That is an amazing dress you're wearing, and, like, you talk about the dress and you tell
2333700	2334700	some...
2334700	2337100	Well, the interesting thing about it to me is it makes me realize the people that are
2337100	2339220	on Letterman aren't really...
2339220	2342500	They're just plugging a movie, but it's not like they come out and do a scene from it.
2342500	2345220	Like, they just come out and they talk about parking tickets.
2345220	2348580	Well, have you noticed that every interviewer has their different thing?
2348580	2351940	Conan O'Brien lets pretty girls touch his hair.
2351940	2352940	You want to touch his hair?
2352940	2353940	He's like, ugh.
2353940	2356580	Like, you know, he pretends that his hair is, like, you know, alive or whatever.
2356580	2360340	David Letterman tends to hit on really pretty girls, and he makes, like, awkward people
2360340	2361740	feel even more awkward.
2361740	2363700	He's kind of mean, but he's kind of nice at the same time.
2363700	2364700	I don't know.
2364700	2366540	Maybe he just plays favorites, but I don't know.
2366540	2368860	You could talk to him about that on the panel, right?
2368860	2372420	You could come out, you'd turn the tables on him, and he'd be like, wow, what's happening?
2372420	2375060	And he'd be like, I'm Lisette, motherfucker.
2375060	2376660	All right.
2376660	2378780	Well, thank you, Lisette, for sharing your information.
2378780	2379780	Lisette.
2379780	2380780	Thank you.
2380780	2394300	That was experienced weight person, Lisette, on how to make a weight person feel bad.
2394300	2396460	I worked as a busboy once, and it was the worst.
2396460	2402220	I was so bad at it, because I hate people.
2402220	2403220	Busboys hate people?
2403220	2404220	No, I hate people.
2404220	2405220	Right.
2405220	2411300	I worked at our country club, and so it was just rich white douchebags, and I was broke,
2411300	2413220	and it was a terrible job.
2413220	2418260	And one time, I came out, and we had to build everything, so you had to put a dance floor
2418260	2421980	together and put sectional walls up and carry these giant tables out.
2421980	2426060	So by the time the guests were there, you were exhausted, and you were cut.
2426060	2430140	We always had the band-aids on, and we're serving food, it's totally gross.
2430140	2436980	And I was carrying a tray out, and I had 15 or so little silver coffee creamer, like creamer
2436980	2438620	tins in it.
2438620	2446180	And I had to put one on each table, and I was so tired and fatigued, I dropped it all
2446180	2451300	over the back of a lady in a black velvet dress.
2451300	2452820	And everybody loses.
2452820	2458220	I felt bad, she felt bad, the husband felt bad, everyone in the world died a little bit.
2458220	2462060	And the husband got up, and he just started screaming at me.
2462060	2466380	And I wanted to disappear and die, and I'd do anything to make that not happen.
2466380	2468620	I'm so like, I'm just blushing.
2468620	2473620	And this guy, he's about a head shorter than me, but he's a big, stocky little fucker.
2473620	2477700	He just turns purple, and he's like, God damn it, and he starts screaming at me.
2478700	2482300	And the wife was covered in creamer.
2482300	2486500	I'm covered in shame, and I just looked at the guy and I go, enough.
2486500	2492620	And I put my finger in his face, and he kept yelling, and I go, shut up.
2492620	2498940	Like you're yelling is not making her happier, like I'm going to murder you, because you're
2498940	2499940	making this worse.
2499940	2504820	And then I called my manager a cunt, and I left.
2508500	2510500	For those listening, Jeff just applauded himself.
2514100	2516100	As soon as you get listening, I frequently am underneath the podium.
2516100	2518300	I'm frequently applauding myself.
2518300	2520500	I think every time I've ever quit a job, I've called somebody a cunt.
2520500	2522500	That's not good.
2522500	2523500	It's better in England, right?
2523500	2525900	It's more of a terrible word here.
2525900	2527700	Yeah, I meant it to hurt.
2530100	2533700	I worked at a Trader Joe's, and she just stole everything.
2534700	2539700	There's nothing worse you can call another man than the C word, because it's a horrible
2539700	2541100	word to call a woman.
2541100	2544100	And then you're calling a man.
2544100	2551100	When I've been really angry, I can't even think of examples, but when it's sort of like
2551100	2558600	that primal man-on-man rage, when I really want a guy to feel really terrible about himself,
2558600	2563100	I call him the worst word you can call a woman, which is interesting.
2564500	2566500	It's kind of the opposite of interesting.
2566500	2569500	It's like the most obvious thing in the world.
2569500	2575600	What was the last job you had before a writer, like the actual 9-5, or like an actual job
2575600	2576600	job?
2576600	2582100	The last time, I think it was as a data entry clerk.
2582100	2584100	I think that was my last real job.
2584100	2591600	I think after I quit that, I was like, I can't, because I was, I'm going to run down my curriculum
2591600	2592600	vitae.
2592600	2594600	Is that how you say that?
2594600	2595600	Yeah.
2595600	2601600	A lot of resume writers here that have that on their CV.
2601600	2607600	I worked as a caddy at a country club.
2607600	2609600	It was awful.
2609600	2611600	You're working for like way subminimum wage.
2611600	2617100	You have to get this permit that allows you to be working for not really any money at
2617100	2618100	all.
2618100	2619100	So you're just reliant on these tips.
2620100	2622100	It's a Milwaukee country club.
2622100	2625100	It wasn't like they were just throwing 50s around.
2625100	2627100	They would just give you a dollar.
2627100	2629100	I've had caddies before, like in nice courses.
2629100	2630100	I have friends who are good golfers.
2630100	2631100	I get to go play with them.
2631100	2634100	And the caddies are actually like, they help you read your putts.
2634100	2636100	They tell you what club selection they give you.
2636100	2638100	Do you have any golf knowledge?
2638100	2640100	I would just fake it.
2640100	2647100	I would go, because the guy would go, like, I remember one triumph was the guy going,
2648100	2651100	so what do you think, like, five wood?
2651100	2654100	And I was like, eh.
2654100	2657100	I was like, eh, three, three, huh?
2657100	2659100	And I was like, yeah, yeah.
2659100	2664100	And then he, I remember, and then he hit it, and he got on the,
2664100	2667100	across this body of water.
2667100	2670100	It was like a river between, I don't think he got on the green.
2670100	2672100	But he was like, it landed.
2672100	2676100	And then he was like, huh, no, you were right.
2677100	2680100	And he said, if I used a five, I would have been swimming.
2680100	2683100	And I was like, yeah, yeah.
2683100	2684100	Oh, yeah.
2684100	2687100	You'd have been wet, Jack.
2687100	2690100	Then you'd need to get a snorkel porker out.
2690100	2691100	Snorkel porker.
2691100	2696100	But you had to clean their clubs with a toothbrush at the end of everything.
2696100	2698100	It was like, you haul their clubs.
2698100	2702100	That's some heavy shit, dude, like a bag of golf clubs.
2703100	2706100	And then sometimes 18 holes.
2706100	2710100	And then get it back to the so-called caddyshack,
2710100	2713100	which is not as fun as it sounds.
2713100	2721100	And wash the fucking grass stains out of the ridges in their clubs
2721100	2724100	for 40 minutes with a toothbrush.
2724100	2727100	And then eventually they'll come over and they'll give you a dollar.
2727100	2728100	A dollar?
2728100	2730100	Well, this was back in the 40s, right?
2730100	2733100	This was Carter dollars.
2733100	2737100	They weren't worth as much, but there was also no oil.
2737100	2740100	I don't know.
2740100	2746100	My longest job was a dishwasher at the rehab center in Milwaukee.
2746100	2747100	I would wash dishes.
2747100	2749100	Spencer, do you miss your job at Apple?
2749100	2750100	I miss the people.
2750100	2753100	I think that a lot of the people I worked with were really awesome.
2753100	2756100	But I don't miss anything else about the job.
2756100	2758100	Do you miss Steve Jobs?
2758100	2759100	No.
2759100	2762100	Did he ever come in and go like, teamwork?
2762100	2763100	Yeah.
2763100	2767100	No, we hung out a few times.
2767100	2768100	You lying?
2768100	2771100	Yeah.
2771100	2773100	I just I answered the phones all the time.
2773100	2776100	Like, like it is really stupid, like terrible stuff.
2776100	2780100	So I mean, I when I when I applied for the job, I was like,
2780100	2781100	how much phones are involved?
2781100	2782100	And they're like, none.
2782100	2786100	And then I got hired and they're like, we're adjusting our positions.
2786100	2787100	So you answer the phone now.
2787100	2792100	So it was like it was the worst possible situation for me
2792100	2798100	because I hate dealing with idiots I can't see.
2798100	2800100	So I mean, no, but it was really terrible.
2800100	2804100	People would be all like, hey, I got an iPad.
2804100	2805100	OK.
2805100	2806100	Yeah.
2806100	2808100	It takes pictures.
2808100	2809100	Yeah.
2809100	2810100	Yeah.
2810100	2814100	It's just like they don't even have anything to say.
2814100	2817100	It's just lonely people.
2817100	2819100	It's just called the talk.
2823100	2825100	I'm taking a picture of my phone.
2825100	2826100	Yeah.
2826100	2828100	So can you see me doing that?
2832100	2836100	Well, let me let me let me be let me be an Apple phone
2836100	2841100	answer and you be the worst amalgam of all the Apple people
2841100	2844100	or just or just an example of Apple Apple experience.
2844100	2845100	You hate it.
2845100	2846100	All right.
2846100	2847100	Ring ring.
2847100	2849100	Hello, Apple.
2849100	2850100	Yeah.
2850100	2853100	I got an iPad three G's or something.
2853100	2856100	I think it's it's got a touch pad on the top.
2861100	2862100	Is this based on reality?
2862100	2865100	Normally when there's icons, you see icons.
2865100	2868100	But I'm just seeing a black Apple on a gray background.
2868100	2871100	Oh, it sounds like your product is starting up.
2871100	2872100	I know that.
2872100	2874100	No, it's been like this since I got it.
2877100	2879100	So is it is it an iPad or?
2879100	2881100	Yeah, it's on my table.
2888100	2889100	Hold on.
2889100	2890100	The kettle's going.
2891100	2892100	I have a follow up.
2892100	2893100	I have a phone.
2893100	2895100	Dan, can you be the Apple employee?
2895100	2897100	But be also be Cobra commander at the same time.
2898100	2899100	All right.
2899100	2900100	New phone call now.
2900100	2902100	Cobra Cobra.
2902100	2905100	Cobra Command has done such a good job of running the country
2905100	2906100	that now it's yeah.
2906100	2908100	Cobra Command is just working on an Apple store.
2909100	2910100	Bring bring.
2910100	2913100	I have been on 15 different lines.
2913100	2915100	I have been on 15 different lines.
2915100	2918100	I have been on 15 different lines.
2918100	2920100	I have been on 15 different lines.
2920100	2922100	I have been transferred seven times.
2922100	2924100	I don't know how Apple products work.
2924100	2926100	Your company is garbage.
2926100	2928100	Can you give me all the free stuff?
2930100	2933100	I appreciate your situation.
2933100	2936100	Could you please just relax for a moment?
2936100	2938100	This is the first time I'm speaking to you.
2938100	2941100	Your company has charged me four times in the last month
2941100	2943100	for bills I haven't seen.
2943100	2946100	I've never seen any certificates or receipts.
2946100	2949100	I didn't even know I'd be charged for stuff like HBO.
2952100	2956100	It sounds like you're describing something other than Apple, sir.
2956100	2958100	This is the AT&T store.
2958100	2959100	This is Apple.
2959100	2961100	The AT&T store.
2962100	2965100	I called AT&T corporate and they transferred me here.
2972100	2973100	Later.
2976100	2979100	Hello, AT&T. This is Destro.
2981100	2984100	He transfers all the AT&T calls to Cobra Commander.
2985100	2986100	Because he hates him.
2988100	2990100	There was some crazy shit going on in G.I. Joe, man.
2990100	2996100	Right when they ended, that was when Destro and Professor Mindbender
2996100	2998100	went off on the side and they were like,
2998100	3000100	I don't think Cobra Commander is doing a good job.
3000100	3009100	And they made Sir Pentor out of the DNA of like 85 different dictators,
3009100	3010100	except Hitler.
3011100	3013100	It's like the elephant in the room.
3013100	3016100	They're like, we're going to get Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan.
3016100	3018100	And you're like a kid going, what about Hitler?
3019100	3020100	Come on.
3022100	3023100	We're not douchebags.
3023100	3024100	We're not douchebags.
3026100	3030100	Napoleon and Alexander the Great.
3031100	3033100	Vlad the Impaler was in there.
3034100	3036100	Somebody went, yeah.
3040100	3042100	And they activated Sir Pentor.
3044100	3047100	Of course, they put some frog DNA in there or something
3047100	3050100	that made Sir Pentor really unruly.
3051100	3055100	So then toward the end of G.I. Joe,
3055100	3058100	Destro was going back to Cobra Commander and going,
3058100	3059100	I'm sorry.
3059100	3060100	I've kind of fucked up.
3061100	3064100	And they were forming a new, there were like three organizations
3064100	3065100	that were all fighting each other.
3065100	3069100	That's the thing about G.I. Joe is G.I. Joe had its shit together,
3069100	3072100	ran the government, and there was no infighting.
3072100	3076100	And then Cobra was just like, you couldn't get through a day over there.
3076100	3080100	It was just like, why are you always implying that I'm not good?
3080100	3081100	I didn't say that.
3081100	3085100	I just think we should send the microchips to the rockets.
3085100	3089100	Oh, your insolence will be d-d-d-d-d-d-d.
3090100	3092100	It's just like, they were their own worst enemy.
3092100	3094100	Your insolence will be what?
3094100	3096100	Demanded, I don't know.
3096100	3097100	They're self-destructive, I'm telling you.
3097100	3099100	They demanded insolence.
3100100	3101100	All right.
3101100	3102100	Should we...
3102100	3104100	Sir Pentor, do you think you're ever going to get married?
3104100	3106100	I mean, God willing.
3106100	3107100	You want to be married?
3107100	3108100	Sure.
3108100	3110100	And religiously, of course.
3110100	3114100	Yeah, I was going to say only religiously, but that's not very funny.
3114100	3116100	Where would your ideal wedding take place?
3116100	3117100	I don't care.
3118100	3119100	Why does that matter?
3119100	3121100	It's supposed to be for the bride, right?
3121100	3123100	Well, for both.
3123100	3126100	I say for the people that have to sit there.
3126100	3127100	Well, fuck them.
3127100	3130100	No, the whole inviting them to the wedding is fuck them.
3130100	3131100	Well, they could say no.
3131100	3133100	When they get there, they want to get drunk and they want to...
3133100	3136100	That would be pretty good, though, to have a Raiders of the Lost Ark wedding,
3136100	3139100	but you have to make everyone that comes, including Grandma and Grandpa,
3139100	3141100	and everybody comes as Nazis.
3143100	3145100	And then they all get melted.
3147100	3149100	There's all these pyrotechnics and stuff,
3149100	3151100	and then these light beams go through their torsos.
3151100	3152100	Yeah.
3154100	3155100	Yeah, I just think...
3155100	3157100	I mean, I wouldn't mind...
3157100	3161100	I kind of want there to be a character at my wedding.
3162100	3164100	Not even just at the reception.
3166100	3170100	At the actual idea of you're getting married
3170100	3173100	and then someone comes in from the back and says,
3173100	3175100	like, I don't think they should get married,
3175100	3177100	and then you sword fight them.
3178100	3180100	And then you get married.
3180100	3183100	It just said that the audience has something.
3183100	3187100	I bet a guy at the drawing room, his wife is Scottish,
3187100	3189100	and they got married in Scotland,
3189100	3193100	and the ring bearer was the owl from...
3193100	3195100	What's the owl from Harry Potter?
3195100	3198100	Yeah, he fucking flew in and brought the ring.
3198100	3203100	And there's a picture of the owl flying in with the ring,
3203100	3206100	and the crowd's like, what the fuck?
3206100	3207100	Is that Hedwig?
3207100	3208100	It's Hedwig.
3208100	3209100	Hedwig?
3209100	3210100	Hedwig, yeah.
3211100	3214100	So you've got to do that. You've got to budget.
3215100	3217100	Yeah, but I want a nest egg.
3217100	3220100	I'm going to become very miserly, because I want to retire,
3220100	3224100	and I don't want to have to worry about running out of money.
3224100	3227100	So I'm going to become very thrifty.
3227100	3228100	Yeah?
3228100	3231100	I'm just going to get married,
3231100	3234100	stack a bunch of milk crates,
3234100	3238100	and knock them down and then say, I do.
3241100	3244100	The ring will be in one of the crates, I don't know.
3244100	3246100	You guys going to have kids?
3246100	3249100	That, to me, is the larger point of getting married.
3249100	3251100	Although Rob, Shrav, and Kate Throyne,
3251100	3253100	they don't seem to have any plans to have kids,
3253100	3255100	but they were together for so long,
3255100	3257100	as Rob said very touchingly,
3257100	3261100	like he had run out of ways to make her understand how much he loved her,
3261100	3263100	and so they decided to get married,
3263100	3265100	which was one of the most romantic weddings in the world,
3265100	3266100	because they didn't have to.
3266100	3270100	There wasn't like a precursor to having kids that were divorced,
3270100	3272100	as usually is the case.
3274100	3275100	You knew that they were going to be together forever,
3275100	3277100	because they didn't have to get married.
3277100	3279100	They already lived together for like eight years,
3279100	3280100	and then they were just getting married,
3280100	3281100	because they wanted to be married,
3281100	3282100	so you kind of had that.
3282100	3283100	That was the first wedding I was at,
3283100	3285100	that I was like, holy shit, this is the real deal.
3285100	3287100	You guys should get married to Hermentown.
3287100	3290100	It just seems kind of, seems a little tacky.
3290100	3292100	Not that you applauded something tacky,
3292100	3294100	for those of you who started applauding.
3294100	3298100	It's like Tiny Tim getting married on Carson or something.
3301100	3304100	He's referencing some old shit.
3305100	3308100	Yeah, I was just like...
3310100	3311100	Adam, are you going to get married?
3311100	3312100	No.
3312100	3314100	Sure, why not?
3314100	3315100	Okay.
3315100	3316100	Your girlfriend's free, right?
3316100	3317100	Jeez.
3318100	3319100	She's not.
3323100	3325100	What would be the most romantic wedding?
3325100	3327100	How would you get married?
3327100	3331100	I was in Barcelona once, when I was really broke,
3331100	3332100	and I performed on a cruise ship,
3333100	3335100	and we made a bunch of money on the ship,
3335100	3337100	and I just took the money I made
3337100	3340100	and stayed in Barcelona for a few days,
3340100	3342100	and I was walking around the Gothic Quarter,
3342100	3344100	and there's very narrow streets,
3344100	3347100	and there's Salvador Dali exhibits and stuff,
3347100	3349100	and there's really cool little fruit stands,
3349100	3351100	and then it opened up into this big square,
3351100	3353100	and the street was just so narrow,
3353100	3354100	you can't really see the top of buildings,
3354100	3357100	and I walked in, and it was the biggest cathedral in the world.
3357100	3361100	It was just this enormous, huge cathedral,
3361100	3363100	and there was a choir singing from somewhere.
3363100	3365100	You couldn't even see where the choir was,
3365100	3367100	and on the far side, there was a wedding going on,
3367100	3369100	and there was like 12 people there.
3369100	3371100	In the back, there were old ladies lighting candles,
3371100	3373100	and it was very Catholic and doing that,
3373100	3376100	but in the distance, it was just like falsetto choir singing,
3376100	3377100	and there was a wedding going on,
3377100	3380100	and there was doves flying around through the rafters,
3380100	3382100	and it was really lonely and like somber,
3382100	3384100	and I thought that's how I would do it,
3384100	3386100	and I would invite like a few people,
3386100	3388100	and I would come back to LA,
3388100	3391100	and I would have a big party for everybody else,
3391100	3394100	but whoever wanted to come out to like whatever part of Europe
3394100	3396100	or wherever we found the cool castle, we would do it there.
3396100	3398100	Hmm, all right.
3405100	3407100	He applauded himself.
3407100	3409100	I'll see if I can make it.
3409100	3411100	I don't know.
3413100	3416100	Sounds a little snobby.
3419100	3422100	You're invited.
3422100	3425100	I don't know if I'd fit in.
3425100	3427100	Seems a little fancy.
3427100	3430100	It's like a coffee commercial.
3432100	3434100	It's a VIP moon wedding.
3434100	3435100	Exactly, it is a VIP.
3435100	3437100	You'd love it, because nothing would be required of you.
3437100	3439100	You would just come, and then it would be over,
3439100	3441100	and then we'd all go out and have a drink.
3441100	3442100	All right.
3442100	3445100	You got me at the close.
3446100	3449100	All right, well, why don't we roll into our role-playing adventure?
3449100	3450100	Let's do it.
3450100	3452100	Nice and early.
3452100	3455100	Are we bringing up guests to play Camille or Aaron,
3455100	3458100	or should we just go Alfresco?
3458100	3460100	Whatever you guys want.
3460100	3463100	Come on, have an opinion.
3464100	3466100	I'm dying.
3468100	3469100	You're dying?
3469100	3472100	It's more of like an observation, really.
3473100	3475100	Not really an opinion.
3477100	3478100	Are you really dying, Spencer?
3478100	3480100	No, I'm cool.
3481100	3483100	Were you bummed when Steve Jobs died?
3483100	3485100	No, no.
3487100	3488100	Quite the opposite.
3488100	3491100	I'm actually more bothered by it now,
3491100	3494100	retroactively than I was when it happened.
3494100	3496100	Because it affected the health plan?
3496100	3498100	No, I mean, that didn't happen.
3498100	3501100	I don't even think I got a job until after he died or whatever.
3501100	3502100	I mean, I don't know.
3502100	3507100	But it's just, I mean, he was like a genius.
3507100	3508100	Yeah, he's a visionary.
3508100	3510100	Yeah, there's not too many people like that.
3510100	3513100	And it's like, you know, the world can kind of spin its wheels
3513100	3515100	and like march inexorably forward,
3515100	3519100	but all the good leaps are by some crazy cool guy that like leads people.
3519100	3520100	Yeah, yeah.
3520100	3522100	You kind of pointed at me when you said that.
3522100	3523100	Yeah.
3523100	3528100	What I'm trying to say is it takes a special kind of person
3528100	3530100	with a special kind of charisma.
3530100	3531100	He didn't point that.
3531100	3533100	His hand moved toward his backpack.
3533100	3535100	No, he just kind of flicked his wrist a little bit.
3535100	3536100	I felt like it was pointing at me.
3536100	3538100	A perceived point.
3538100	3541100	Well, you know, Jeff, the world can move inexorably forward,
3541100	3549100	but the kinds of people who decide they want to be pointed at get pointed at.
3549100	3556100	I'm the Steve Jobs of thinking people are pointing at me.
3556100	3559100	I don't know how I went down this rabbit hole,
3559100	3566100	but I was looking at quotes from him and stuff.
3566100	3568100	This is like a very interesting guy.
3568100	3570100	Isn't there a biopic coming out about him?
3570100	3571100	Is Ashton Kutcher playing him?
3571100	3572100	Yeah, Ashton Kutcher.
3572100	3574100	That was a train wreck.
3574100	3575100	I don't know why that's a bummer.
3575100	3578100	Ashton Kutcher won the Teen Choice Award.
3578100	3581100	There's a video that went kind of viral of Ashton Kutcher
3581100	3582100	winning his Teen Choice Award.
3582100	3586100	And he went up and he broke it down.
3586100	3589100	He said that his first name is not Ashton.
3589100	3591100	It's Chris or something.
3591100	3594100	Chris Kutcher.
3594100	3596100	It occurs to me, Anatoly, that that is what...
3596100	3599100	Okay, this is a fucking deep cut Harman Town reference,
3599100	3602100	but when Anatoly was at the Rick and Morty panel at Comic-Con
3602100	3606100	and you were pointing at your shirt, you had an Archer t-shirt on,
3606100	3607100	that's what I thought you were saying.
3607100	3609100	Ashton Kutcher.
3609100	3611100	Ashton Kutcher.
3612100	3617100	Anyways, but Ashton Kutcher went up and he...
3617100	3620100	There's just 16-year-old girls screaming the whole time he's talking,
3620100	3629100	but he decided to profess the virtues of hard labor and creativity.
3629100	3633100	He said, I never had a job that I felt above.
3633100	3636100	I've swept floors, I've done this, I've done that,
3636100	3638100	and I never felt like I was above my job.
3638100	3640100	I just worked hard and tried to get a better job.
3640100	3648100	It's not very subversive, but I guess it's better than everyone dreams
3648100	3651100	so you can have a limo too.
3651100	3655100	But then the nicer thing was that he really espoused the virtues
3655100	3658100	of being a proactive, creative thinker.
3658100	3663100	He said, don't live within the world that you're going into.
3663100	3666100	Look at it as a thing that needs to be expanded and built upon.
3666100	3669100	Go to the moon, Dan Harmon, he said.
3670100	3677100	So when you're at home and your jammy's watching the Teen Choice Awards...
3677100	3680100	I'm like, wait a minute, there's no teens on here.
3682100	3685100	Back to 4chan.
3685100	3688100	I misinterpreted the title of this thing entirely.
3688100	3691100	This is a bunch of old guys accepting awards.
3695100	3697100	Choice Teen.
3698100	3700100	But anyways, Ashton Kutcher.
3700100	3701100	Yeah, his name's not Ashton.
3701100	3703100	And he's going to be playing Steve Jobs,
3703100	3708100	who I just found out years after he died was an interesting guy.
3708100	3710100	It was right under my nose that he was.
3710100	3712100	I've been using all his products.
3712100	3715100	Calling Spencer at work.
3715100	3719100	Just to tell him that there's a camera in it.
3719100	3721100	All right, let's do this.
3721100	3724100	No, so no people then.
3724100	3726100	So you want people up there?
3726100	3728100	No, I'm just clarifying.
3728100	3730100	Seems like he wants people.
3730100	3733100	Which should we base our Who We Bring Up on?
3733100	3735100	I know the subreddit, the Harmontown subreddit,
3735100	3740100	was very enthralled with young Tyler last week.
3740100	3742100	Is it a meritocracy?
3742100	3745100	Does he just earn another chance at the wheel?
3745100	3747100	I think he earned it.
3747100	3749100	Maybe we bring Spencer up.
3749100	3750100	Sorry, sorry, not Spencer.
3750100	3753100	We bring Tyler up and we bring maybe someone new up.
3754100	3756100	How about Lisette?
3756100	3757100	Tyler and Lisette.
3757100	3759100	Which Lisette would you like to play?
3759100	3760100	Sure.
3760100	3761100	Okay.
3767100	3769100	Hi, how are you?
3769100	3771100	Spencer, just to make things different,
3771100	3775100	when you read the description that catches up to date,
3775100	3777100	can we do it to the song?
3777100	3778100	Can we?
3778100	3780100	Yeah, sure, why not?
3780100	3783100	I'm going to start it from the top.
3783100	3785100	I should hope so.
3785100	3789100	The character shoots are being dispensered.
3789100	3792100	Ha, ha, ha.
3792100	3794100	Thank you, Tyler.
3794100	3796100	There's like three name puns that exist for me
3796100	3798100	and I've heard them all.
3798100	3799100	What are the other two?
3799100	3801100	Yeah, that's a great idea.
3806100	3807100	I'm not going to abuse that power,
3807100	3809100	I just want to know what the other two are.
3809100	3811100	No one that will ever hear this interacts with me
3811100	3813100	on any level or medium.
3813100	3817100	Would you rather simply arm us and be done with it
3817100	3820100	or sit through the next ten minute brainstorming session?
3821100	3824100	Because the dispenser is killing me.
3826100	3827100	Two out of three.
3827100	3828100	Two out of three?
3828100	3830100	Sounds like dispensership.
3830100	3832100	That's the third.
3832100	3835100	No, that's the dispensership?
3835100	3837100	Well, you already did dispenser.
3837100	3839100	He was doing censorship.
3839100	3842100	Yeah, no, that's not.
3842100	3844100	I'm done.
3844100	3847100	Yeah, it sounds like you had it really bad.
3847100	3852100	My last name rhymed with the lead selling toilet paper.
3854100	3856100	There was commercials all over the...
3856100	3857100	Did anyone literally call you?
3857100	3858100	What's up, Sherman Harmon?
3858100	3859100	Don't squeeze the Harmon?
3859100	3862100	Are you fucking kidding me?
3862100	3863100	Every day.
3863100	3865100	You guys are too young to remember.
3865100	3867100	There was this guy, Mr. Whipple.
3867100	3870100	Apparently, people loved wiping their ass in the 70s.
3870100	3871100	You don't see a lot of...
3871100	3874100	There's that cartoon bear now, which I think is interesting
3874100	3876100	because they're like, oh shit, our toilet paper is so good,
3876100	3877100	a bear could wipe his ass.
3877100	3879100	Is that weird that people latch onto pop culture references
3879100	3880100	just to make fun of you?
3880100	3883100	I'm Tyler, and then on the late end of high school
3883100	3884100	when Fight Club was going to be like,
3884100	3885100	oh, what's up, Tyler Durden?
3885100	3888100	I'm like, I'm not insulted?
3888100	3891100	Yeah, that's just future Verizon employees
3891100	3894100	just exercising their muscles.
3894100	3897100	Little muscle in the back of their spine.
3897100	3898100	Lizette, did you get teased?
3898100	3899100	Did your name rhyme with anything funny?
3899100	3902100	Or is there a Lizette tease?
3902100	3903100	I got teased in high school
3903100	3905100	because I was really tall and skinny
3905100	3908100	and I had perfect skin and really nice hair.
3908100	3911100	She is very beautiful, for the record.
3911100	3913100	But the reason I would...
3913100	3915100	I was about to tease you for the same reasons.
3915100	3916100	I looked...
3916100	3918100	What's up, flawless skin.
3918100	3919100	She's so pretty.
3919100	3920100	I looked relatively normal,
3920100	3922100	but the second I opened my mouth,
3922100	3923100	it was like, oh, she's a dork.
3923100	3924100	Never mind.
3924100	3926100	She looks okay, but she's pretty nerdy.
3926100	3929100	So, yeah, I got made fun of numerous times.
3929100	3930100	Numerous.
3930100	3931100	Yeah.
3931100	3934100	The worst one I ever heard was by this girl, Leah.
3934100	3937100	I don't know if it was JD's wife or...
3937100	3941100	I was having this conversation with a woman named Leah,
3941100	3944100	and we were talking about,
3944100	3946100	well, what was the horrible thing
3946100	3947100	that they said about you on the playground?
3947100	3949100	And she was like, man, I had the worst.
3949100	3950100	And I thought of her name, and I was like,
3950100	3951100	what, Princess Leah?
3951100	3952100	Or what?
3952100	3955100	She was like, leotard.
3956100	3958100	They called her leotard.
3958100	3959100	The first thing that came to mind was like,
3959100	3960100	diarrhea.
3960100	3961100	Diarrhea.
3961100	3962100	Oh, God.
3962100	3963100	That's why I know.
3963100	3964100	Diarrhea.
3964100	3968100	Such a pretty name, and then so maligned.
3968100	3970100	Yeah, if you want to name a kid a name
3970100	3972100	that cannot be teased, Jeff Davis.
3972100	3975100	Nothing funny rhymes with it.
3975100	3978100	Jeff gave us.
3978100	3979100	Gave us...
3979100	3981100	Yeah, but it's like it doesn't really hurt you
3981100	3984100	because you're so gay.
3984100	3987100	Which is great.
3987100	3988100	Because gay people are amazing.
3988100	3992100	That wedding you described, super gay.
3992100	3993100	Oh, yeah.
3993100	3995100	I'm going to marry a dude there.
3995100	3997100	Have you ever been to a gay wedding?
3997100	3998100	Uh, yeah.
3998100	4000100	No, I haven't.
4000100	4001100	Have you?
4001100	4002100	No.
4002100	4003100	I don't think.
4003100	4004100	Are you proposing?
4004100	4005100	Am I what?
4005100	4007100	Am I proposing?
4007100	4008100	Have you ever been to a gay wedding?
4008100	4010100	Would you like to?
4010100	4012100	Let's have a gay wedding right now.
4012100	4013100	I extend a hand.
4013100	4016100	You open up a jack-o-lantern, there's a ring.
4016100	4018100	Also, happy Halloween, apparently.
4018100	4021100	I don't know.
4021100	4024100	No, I don't think I have.
4024100	4025100	That's not true.
4025100	4027100	I have been to a gay wedding.
4027100	4032100	I guess it's a good sign that I can't really remember.
4032100	4035100	Or you're an alcoholic.
4035100	4037100	Yeah, I mean, I don't have a good memory,
4037100	4039100	but that's a good sign that I wasn't like,
4039100	4042100	oh, fuck, I'll never forget that gay wedding.
4042100	4045100	It was so gay.
4045100	4048100	It was like, you know, if I was at a gay wedding,
4048100	4052100	two men decided to spend the rest of their lives together
4052100	4054100	and they blended into the other people.
4054100	4055100	All weddings are gay.
4055100	4058100	They are the gayest things that straight people could ever do.
4058100	4062100	Which is another reason why gay marriage should absolutely be a thing.
4062100	4066100	It's like, let these people into their house.
4066100	4068100	They've been planning all of our weddings forever.
4068100	4069100	Exactly.
4069100	4070100	Let them have one.
4070100	4071100	Right, that's the thing.
4071100	4074100	So in a normal wedding, the dude's pretty much just hands-off,
4074100	4076100	like, whatever, you do whatever you want to do, honey.
4076100	4079100	Is it in the situation of a gay wedding where they're both really hands-on
4079100	4080100	and that's even worse?
4080100	4084100	No, I think in most couples, there's always the male archetype
4084100	4087100	and the female archetype, regardless of what your sex is, I think.
4087100	4089100	Maybe I'm just saying...
4089100	4090100	Just sense.
4090100	4096100	Okay, I'm sorry, but my lovely cousin who is gay
4096100	4099100	was going to marry his boyfriend, but, you know...
4102100	4105100	I'm allowed an opinion and I just think that most couples, there's the dude
4105100	4107100	and there's the girl, regardless of what sex you are,
4107100	4109100	that could be an archetype, I'm just saying.
4109100	4112100	So I'm allowed an opinion so y'all can suck it, okay?
4116100	4117100	I was very defensive about that.
4117100	4119100	I don't like being told that I'm wrong and even if I'm wrong,
4119100	4121100	just respect the fact that I'm up here talking.
4121100	4122100	Thank you, I'm just saying.
4122100	4124100	Who is groaning out there?
4124100	4128100	You, ma'am, you disagree with that, that there's a male and female archetype?
4128100	4130100	I mean, it's just not true.
4130100	4132100	Yeah, it's just not true.
4132100	4136100	That's a stereotype that's existed.
4136100	4139100	Well, nothing's true that you're going to say about everybody.
4139100	4143100	Yeah, I think it's unfair to make those sorts of generalizations.
4143100	4149100	And as someone who is queer and who knows and has experienced a fair amount
4149100	4152100	of gay weddings, there are plenty of people where both members of the couple
4153100	4155100	are intimately involved with all of the planning.
4155100	4157100	And straight weddings, too.
4157100	4159100	Like, my friends just got married.
4159100	4163100	They were both totally hands-on, so, you know.
4163100	4166100	That's one of the first questions that straight people have about gay people
4166100	4172100	is whether it's a lesbian couple or a gay male couple.
4172100	4176100	That's the first question is, is there a hierarchy?
4176100	4179100	But really, the obvious answer is because I'm in a relationship
4179100	4184100	where there's no clear hierarchy.
4184100	4189100	So obviously, there's not going to be always a dude
4189100	4194100	and I don't even know how to use the language without...
4194100	4196100	I said I'd marry you, Dan.
4196100	4199100	Do you think that's like the rationalization of straight people
4199100	4200100	who don't know any better?
4200100	4201100	Or it's just like, I don't...
4201100	4203100	You're the same...
4203100	4205100	What do you use to do, right?
4205100	4207100	It's just the observation bias.
4207100	4209100	I apologize for the generalization, I'm sorry.
4209100	4214100	But it could be that one's more passive and one's more controlling.
4214100	4215100	Regardless of...
4215100	4217100	I mean, no matter what you say, Lizette, they're always going to just...
4217100	4218100	Regardless of your gender.
4218100	4220100	I'm just saying, you know, some couples...
4220100	4222100	I've met a lot of couples in my life.
4222100	4223100	Some people are more passive.
4223100	4225100	And of the two, one's more passive.
4225100	4227100	One could be more passive.
4227100	4228100	One could be more controlling.
4228100	4231100	I'll say could as not to generalize.
4231100	4233100	Versatile is the word.
4234100	4237100	Not everybody is versatile, unfortunately, but okay, sure.
4237100	4238100	Let's go with that.
4238100	4243100	It's almost as if these relationships aren't defined by the sexualities of the people.
4243100	4244100	Exactly!
4244100	4245100	You're absolutely right.
4245100	4248100	That's why I apologize for the generalization, but it could...
4248100	4249100	Could it not be...
4249100	4251100	Could it not be...
4251100	4253100	Would it not be...
4253100	4254100	What?
4254100	4256100	You're digging yourself a hole.
4256100	4257100	Would it be a bad...
4257100	4258100	Would it be a bad...
4258100	4260100	Okay, if you're going to make your...
4260100	4262100	Wait a second, hold on.
4262100	4263100	Let it go!
4263100	4265100	Let it go!
4265100	4266100	Let it go!
4266100	4268100	I think I need to let it go.
4272100	4274100	All I wanted to say was that if you had...
4282100	4285100	When Adam Goldberg is heckling you...
4287100	4289100	That is an indictment.
4290100	4292100	All right, let's play some D&D, Spencer, shall we?
4298100	4301100	I'd like to revisit the last topic.
4301100	4303100	No, no.
4305100	4308100	Last time on Harmon Town, D.
4308100	4310100	And D.
4310100	4316100	After leaving the frozen city of Fornheim and plunging into an icy canyon to the north,
4316100	4325100	our heroes managed to avoid the chilling effects of nature through a combination of theatrics and magical resistances to cold weather.
4325100	4335100	Having bargained away the fragments of power for Sharpie's life and as well as a detachment of summoned skeletons,
4335100	4340100	the band was merry and in great spirits until they heard a noise behind them.
4340100	4341100	It was Yurch.
4342100	4346100	Yes, the urine-soaked knoll was back and warned of a demonic outpost just beyond.
4346100	4351100	A massive wall jammed into the ice guarded by monsters and demons.
4351100	4355100	The party taunted and ambushed some of the gate guards, causing the black gate to open
4355100	4360100	and a massive ogre, bearing archers on its back, lumbered out.
4360100	4368100	After a painful prostate stimulation by Mulrain's tree token and a volley of fireballs and other flaming backpacks,
4368100	4370100	Quark got into the ogre's pants.
4372100	4376100	A few more flaming bolts to the brainstem and the ogre was down.
4377100	4378100	That's pretty much it.
4388100	4390100	So yeah, you just killed that ogre.
4390100	4391100	Is the gate still open right now?
4391100	4396100	Yeah, you've just killed the ogre and you stand at the open gate through the icy canyon.
4396100	4403100	There's some guards and demons remaining on this gate, but they're kind of up a few stories tall and it's open right now.
4403100	4406100	Do they look like they're trying to stop us or are they like, oh shit, they killed an ogre.
4406100	4407100	We're not going to mess with them.
4407100	4409100	They look like they're off balance.
4409100	4417100	And as I'm speaking, this is happening, they start to tumble and fall off the gate as it starts to swing wider open.
4417100	4423100	But now you see all these dudes kind of plummeting from the gate onto the icy floor and they're just hitting the ground.
4424100	4425100	Crunch.
4425100	4426100	Smash.
4427100	4428100	Splat.
4428100	4430100	Was one of them Admiral Darkstar?
4430100	4431100	Nope.
4431100	4432100	Damn it.
4432100	4434100	Let's go through the gate, you guys.
4434100	4435100	Let's do it.
4435100	4439100	Skeleton army, ho!
4439100	4440100	All right.
4440100	4441100	You head forward.
4441100	4445100	Have we lost any skeletons or do we still have the full complement of skeletons?
4445100	4447100	They were kind of scarce in the ogre battle.
4447100	4448100	I don't think you lost any.
4448100	4449100	Okay, good.
4449100	4450100	Yeah.
4450100	4460100	So you're heading up this icy slope beyond this gate and you can see at the top of the slope you can, the reflection of the sun is kind of blinding you and making it hard to see forward.
4462100	4464100	Be blind now.
4464100	4465100	We're blind?
4465100	4467100	No, you just can't see very well.
4467100	4470100	How, can we have any estimation of how high it goes?
4470100	4472100	It's just into the abyss.
4472100	4474100	You would if you weren't so blinded.
4475100	4476100	I'm a bitch.
4476100	4477100	Yeah.
4478100	4482100	Can I send Avenger up as the weather quelled a little bit?
4482100	4483100	Yeah, yeah.
4483100	4487100	Avenger, go straight up and spy.
4488100	4492100	You send Avenger straight up to spy.
4493100	4501100	And after some time he comes back, he gives you a look that says, I went up there and what I saw, I can't really repeat, except I can't repeat.
4502100	4503100	It was a bunch of demons, see?
4503100	4504100	It was like an army.
4504100	4508100	An army of demons and demonic creatures all standing outside this big black box.
4508100	4510100	It was the Black Keep, see?
4511100	4518100	Is your bird from the 30s kind of a gangster from like a...
4518100	4519100	Yeah.
4520100	4521100	Shit.
4521100	4522100	There's a bunch of demons, see?
4522100	4526100	Avengers saw a bunch of, there's an army of demons on the other side of this gate.
4526100	4527100	How many?
4528100	4529100	An army.
4529100	4530100	An army.
4530100	4531100	An army of demons.
4532100	4533100	Yep.
4533100	4535100	Over 10, Avenger?
4535100	4536100	Over 10.
4537100	4538100	Under 40?
4538100	4539100	Under 40.
4539100	4540100	Okay.
4540100	4541100	Well, we got a...
4541100	4542100	Oh, really?
4542100	4543100	Yeah, it's a small army.
4543100	4547100	So is this like the main black fortress where supposedly Admiral Darkstar is?
4547100	4548100	Who are you talking to?
4549100	4550100	My party members.
4551100	4552100	Yes.
4552100	4553100	Right?
4553100	4554100	Yeah.
4554100	4556100	This is the Black Keep, right?
4557100	4558100	Yeah.
4558100	4559100	The Black Keep.
4559100	4560100	An army.
4560100	4564100	We have us and 40 skeletons and there appears to be tons of them.
4565100	4566100	Less than 40.
4566100	4567100	Less than 40, is that...
4567100	4568100	More than 10.
4569100	4571100	It doesn't seem like we're in a good position.
4571100	4572100	We can take them.
4572100	4574100	No one feels confident about this.
4574100	4575100	I don't know.
4575100	4580100	I think we need someone in our party who has a sexuality type to plan this attack.
4581100	4585100	And the rest of us could be a little more laid back about it.
4586100	4591100	I'm not saying that the only woman should be the one that plans the attack.
4591100	4595100	I'm just saying that it tends to be the woman that wants to plan attacks.
4596100	4597100	I think it should be...
4597100	4599100	I think it should be you.
4600100	4601100	Oh, really?
4601100	4602100	Yeah.
4602100	4603100	Why?
4603100	4604100	Clark, are you a master strategist?
4604100	4605100	Are you a master strategist?
4605100	4606100	I'm a barbarian.
4606100	4610100	My strategy is going to be to run in there willy nilly and go in there and just start
4610100	4611100	kicking ass.
4611100	4612100	That sounds terrible.
4612100	4613100	But you have a sensitivity in your eyes.
4613100	4614100	Well, thank you.
4616100	4619100	I mean, I'm going to knock on the gate.
4620100	4621100	We're already through the gate.
4621100	4622100	Whoa.
4622100	4623100	What do you mean through it?
4623100	4624100	The gate's open.
4624100	4626100	So it's the gate and we have to keep going up the hill to get to the Blackboard.
4626100	4627100	We're through the gate.
4627100	4628100	All right.
4628100	4630100	I'm not a visual learner.
4631100	4632100	Big hill.
4632100	4633100	Auditory.
4633100	4634100	Fortress.
4635100	4636100	All right.
4636100	4637100	Thank you.
4637100	4638100	I guess you're a caveman learner.
4638100	4647100	I organized the skeleton army into a hoplite, like a chevron-shaped attack formation.
4647100	4648100	Sure.
4648100	4649100	A chevron.
4649100	4650100	A phalanx.
4650100	4651100	A phalanx, sure.
4651100	4652100	Different, but similar.
4652100	4653100	Yeah.
4653100	4654100	Really different.
4657100	4658100	I'm sorry.
4658100	4659100	A sorry V.
4661100	4662100	Yeah.
4662100	4663100	Yeah.
4663100	4664100	A lot more accurate than phalanx.
4664100	4665100	Okay.
4665100	4666100	A hoplite.
4666100	4667100	Yeah.
4667100	4668100	They're arranged.
4668100	4669100	They're arranged.
4670100	4671100	March.
4671100	4672100	I say march.
4672100	4673100	You say march.
4673100	4675100	And we start walking up the slope.
4675100	4677100	I guess we should stay behind the skeleton?
4677100	4678100	Yeah.
4678100	4679100	Definitely.
4679100	4680100	Let the skeletons go in there first.
4680100	4681100	All right.
4681100	4682100	Tyler what?
4682100	4683100	Tyler's worried about it.
4683100	4684100	I'm sorry.
4684100	4685100	Christopher?
4685100	4686100	What was it?
4686100	4687100	Nothing.
4687100	4688100	No, I was like, yeah, you're right.
4688100	4689100	Let's stay behind him.
4689100	4690100	Okay.
4690100	4691100	Let's do it.
4691100	4692100	So we march behind our formation of skeletons.
4692100	4693100	All right.
4693100	4694100	The sun's blinding, as I said.
4694100	4696100	The skeletons crest over the hill.
4696100	4697100	They're ahead of you, right?
4697100	4698100	If I heard you.
4698100	4699100	Yes, correct.
4699100	4700100	Yeah.
4700100	4701100	They're ahead of you and you see them.
4701100	4703100	They go over the hill and they disappear.
4703100	4705100	So they're at the top of this place.
4705100	4712100	And from far off, from farther away than if you were closer, for instance, you hear a
4712100	4716100	voice, a voice, a familiar and chilling.
4716100	4718100	I mean, not really chilling.
4718100	4720100	Voice calls out.
4721100	4726100	You seek to lay siege to the Ziggurat Mark 2?
4726100	4731100	Well, let's see if you can take care of my welcome party.
4731100	4734100	Their hospitality is...
4734100	4737100	ATTACK!
4737100	4741100	See, that's PCP.
4741100	4749100	Their hospitality is, shall we say, less than hospitable.
4749100	4750100	That's the more clever version.
4750100	4751100	Yeah.
4751100	4752100	I did a floraby right on it.
4752100	4753100	Yeah.
4753100	4754100	Wait.
4754100	4756100	Whose voice was that?
4756100	4760100	That's Admiral Darkstar, if I know anything.
4760100	4761100	I'm sorry.
4761100	4765100	I didn't hear a thing that was said because I was so dazzled by that.
4765100	4768100	I love looking at Spencer's eyes while he does that voice.
4768100	4770100	Did you see him vibrate?
4770100	4772100	They're just dead eyes.
4772100	4775100	No wonder he's so evil with a voice like that.
4775100	4776100	Yeah.
4776100	4777100	Yeah.
4777100	4780100	What was the upshot of what he said?
4780100	4783100	You dared to assail the Ziggurat Mark 2.
4783100	4786100	That's the upshot?
4786100	4790100	And here's a welcoming committee, but in air quotes.
4790100	4793100	Okay.
4793100	4797100	Can we send Avenger up there and have him flip off?
4797100	4799100	Let's go in there.
4799100	4800100	Let's do it.
4800100	4801100	We'll march the skeletons.
4801100	4802100	I mean, he knows we're coming.
4802100	4803100	That's why he said that stuff.
4803100	4804100	All right.
4804100	4805100	Onward.
4805100	4810100	As you crest the hill, you see all those demons that I was previously mentioning.
4810100	4815100	Let's see about those demons I was previously mentioning.
4815100	4821100	Standing in front of the Black Keep, blocking the ice road towards it is a sizable demonic
4821100	4822100	force.
4822100	4827100	You see about 30 of those sliming yellow, oozy demons that I've mentioned in previous encounters,
4827100	4831100	as well as 10 tall, skinny knights clad in black armor.
4831100	4834100	You also see two purple Porco demons.
4834100	4841100	Those are massive demonic porcupines, as well as a massive red demon standing head
4841100	4843100	and shoulders above the tallest of the dark knights.
4843100	4847100	They stand blocking the road, glaring at you as if daring you to challenge them.
4847100	4851100	However, what you don't see is your skeleton army.
4851100	4852100	What?
4852100	4853100	Oh, great.
4853100	4855100	They just, they decamped?
4855100	4856100	What happened?
4856100	4861100	Well, that's what happens when you send a force to someplace you can't see.
4861100	4862100	We were right behind him.
4862100	4864100	I mean, you were marching right behind him.
4864100	4865100	Yeah.
4865100	4866100	Now they're gone?
4866100	4867100	Yeah.
4867100	4872100	I call out, you hoo, you hoo.
4872100	4873100	Skeletons.
4873100	4877100	These skeletons aren't the most talkative, but yet you don't hear anything.
4877100	4879100	I mean, and so you don't hear anything.
4879100	4881100	Fuck you in your teeth?
4881100	4882100	Nothing?
4882100	4883100	No.
4883100	4885100	Wait, so they're just gone?
4885100	4886100	You don't see them.
4886100	4889100	I mean, so they would appear gone.
4889100	4890100	All right.
4890100	4891100	Well, we can...
4891100	4894100	Oh, you see, there might be like some sort of mirage kind of thing.
4894100	4895100	Yeah.
4895100	4896100	Well, we keep marching forward.
4896100	4897100	I mean, yeah.
4897100	4901100	You feel the ice give way below your feet.
4901100	4902100	You plunge.
4902100	4903100	Shit.
4903100	4904100	Downward.
4904100	4905100	Oops.
4905100	4908100	I bet there's some skeletons down there.
4908100	4911100	Do I get a balance check before I go tumbling to my death?
4911100	4912100	No.
4912100	4913100	You more just kind of tumble.
4913100	4914100	Son of a bitch.
4914100	4915100	Yeah.
4915100	4918100	As you wish.
4919100	4921100	Just watched Princess Bride this weekend.
4921100	4922100	Nice.
4922100	4923100	It's a great movie.
4923100	4924100	Yeah.
4924100	4929100	You fall down, down, down through the icy floor and down, down, down, landing in a dark,
4929100	4933100	icy, cold place on a crunchy pile of bones.
4933100	4934100	Oh, man.
4934100	4935100	Ted.
4935100	4936100	Steve.
4936100	4938100	Laquisha.
4938100	4940100	Number nine.
4940100	4942100	You notice you're all separated.
4942100	4946100	You don't see your friends.
4946100	4947100	So we're all alone?
4947100	4949100	You're all in separate rooms.
4949100	4950100	Quark.
4950100	4951100	Sharpie.
4951100	4953100	All right.
4953100	4954100	Ah.
4954100	4957100	Cocoa.
4957100	4958100	Kristinburg.
4958100	4959100	Yeah.
4959100	4960100	Quark.
4960100	4961100	Quark.
4961100	4962100	So we can hear each other?
4962100	4963100	Just very, very faintly.
4963100	4965100	You can't see in the darkness either.
4965100	4967100	So it's dark and there's bones around us?
4967100	4968100	Yeah.
4968100	4970100	Are these presumably our skeleton army?
4970100	4971100	Yeah.
4972100	4973100	Oops.
4973100	4978100	I take a bone and I wrap a part of my pantaloon.
4978100	4983100	I rip part of my robe off real sexy-like.
4983100	4985100	Wrap it around a bone.
4985100	4986100	Fuck it.
4986100	4989100	I just light a torch.
4989100	4993100	I try to make a torch out of a bone for a while and then I just like, you know what?
4993100	4996100	They don't make them like they do at the store.
4996100	4997100	You're in a chamber.
4997100	5001100	It's a stone chamber except one of the walls is made of ice.
5001100	5004100	There's a hole in the ceiling, presumably where you fell through.
5004100	5009100	And then there's a big iron circular door before you.
5009100	5011100	That's all you see other than the skeletons.
5011100	5014100	Before all of us?
5014100	5016100	I mean, yeah, that's what you all see, I guess.
5016100	5017100	Yeah.
5017100	5019100	I have low light vision so I can see that too probably.
5019100	5020100	I have goggles.
5020100	5021100	Oh, yeah.
5021100	5024100	The goggles of night.
5025100	5027100	So all the skeletons are just dead?
5027100	5028100	No, I mean they're not.
5028100	5029100	Oh.
5029100	5030100	Skeletons.
5030100	5032100	Well, they're undead.
5032100	5035100	Is there any way to make them reassemble or is it just like, sorry?
5035100	5038100	That happens.
5038100	5040100	Hey, reassemble, skeletons.
5040100	5041100	That happens.
5045100	5048100	I try to open my door.
5048100	5049100	Hey Quark!
5049100	5050100	Yeah?
5050100	5052100	Tell your skeletons that they're cool to get back up.
5052100	5054100	Hey everybody, get up!
5054100	5055100	Oh, they all get up.
5055100	5056100	Okay.
5056100	5061100	I say to my skeletons, looks like you hated it.
5066100	5070100	I feel like I'd be like, why we got a fight like this?
5070100	5072100	If they said that.
5072100	5076100	Like if that happened, if I was quicker on the uptake and that happened to me
5076100	5079100	with a waiter, I'd be like, why you got to be like that?
5079100	5080100	I don't know.
5080100	5081100	There's no winning.
5081100	5082100	Yeah.
5082100	5084100	What if you just hit him?
5084100	5085100	That'd be winning.
5085100	5087100	Because the day hit them.
5087100	5089100	They had to wait on my table.
5089100	5091100	They're already bummed out.
5091100	5094100	They're just like, it's a sad situation for everybody.
5094100	5098100	What if you just stare at them and maintain unblinking eye contact?
5098100	5103100	I mean, these are all just things like, I'm not going to condition,
5103100	5105100	I'm saying they have to stop.
5105100	5109100	We can't come up with ways to make them miserable in response.
5109100	5110100	It's not miserable.
5110100	5112100	Just make them go, maybe I shouldn't have said that.
5112100	5115100	Maybe I should think about saying that in the future.
5115100	5118100	Maybe I should become a better person in general.
5118100	5121100	If I can accomplish that with a stare, I've done something right.
5121100	5124100	If I care enough about it, I'll bring literature.
5124100	5129100	That's like how they can opt out of saying that and leave it on the table
5129100	5133100	and just go, just so you know, you don't have to do a bit
5133100	5136100	when you see crumbs on the plate.
5136100	5138100	You feel like they're calling you fat when they say that?
5138100	5139100	No, no, honestly not.
5139100	5141100	I just think it's like a tiny little example
5141100	5144100	of how we just kind of had these habits that were just kind of like,
5144100	5147100	you know, just catch phrases and got milks,
5147100	5149100	too much informations and things.
5149100	5151100	But that's an example of one that kind of like,
5151100	5153100	in that tiny little split second moment,
5153100	5156100	it's just like confusion and anxiety happen.
5156100	5159100	Never happiness, ever.
5159100	5161100	Yeah, yeah.
5161100	5164100	But sometimes also you're talking to somebody who kind of feels bad
5164100	5167100	that they've just mowed down a fucking bucket of chicken.
5168100	5170100	You know, there's that, too, I guess.
5170100	5172100	There aren't even Bowens left on the plate.
5172100	5174100	You must have hated it.
5176100	5178100	What restaurant are you going to?
5178100	5180100	You eat a bucket of chicken?
5180100	5181100	KFC.
5181100	5184100	This is like a comic-con panel.
5184100	5186100	You're just going to catch me in a...
5186100	5188100	I was going to coach her.
5190100	5192100	All right, so if one of the doors is made...
5192100	5193100	Walls is made of ice, right?
5193100	5195100	Yeah, yeah.
5195100	5196100	You were opening a door, right?
5196100	5197100	Yeah, I tried to open the door.
5197100	5201100	Yeah, so you open the iron door and it swings forth,
5201100	5204100	and inside you see a large gray-skinned humanoid creature
5204100	5207100	with blazing eyes and large ram's horns.
5208100	5212100	He gives a mighty dolt-raw roar and then closes the door.
5215100	5217100	Well, you found the men's room.
5219100	5221100	I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
5221100	5223100	Can I try opening my door?
5223100	5224100	Yeah.
5225100	5227100	Is it the same guy?
5227100	5228100	No.
5228100	5231100	This door opens into a larger icy chamber,
5231100	5234100	and flitting around said icy chamber
5234100	5238100	is a small blue imp flying around on bat wings.
5238100	5239100	Asshole.
5240100	5241100	Okay.
5241100	5242100	Yeah.
5242100	5245100	Behind him you can see a staircase going upwards.
5245100	5246100	Okay.
5247100	5248100	I yell at the imp.
5248100	5249100	I'm like, hey!
5249100	5250100	Why are we...
5250100	5251100	What are you doing?
5251100	5252100	Stop that!
5252100	5253100	Talk to me!
5253100	5254100	What are you doing?
5254100	5255100	You guys can hear that faintly.
5255100	5256100	Okay.
5256100	5258100	It doesn't respond to you, though.
5258100	5259100	Is that you, Christopher?
5259100	5262100	Yeah, there's this blue shithead flying around in his room.
5262100	5264100	I don't know what he's doing.
5264100	5266100	There's a big horn-faced guy outside my door.
5266100	5267100	He looks like an asshole.
5268100	5269100	I'm just hanging out.
5269100	5270100	This sucks, you guys!
5270100	5273100	Open your door and see what's out there, Mall Raid and Sharpie.
5273100	5275100	May I open my door?
5275100	5276100	You may.
5277100	5278100	I would like to open the door.
5278100	5279100	Okay.
5280100	5283100	You open the door and it swings open.
5283100	5288100	Inside you can see a horrendous assortment of rusted metal blades on rusted metal poles.
5288100	5293100	As the door opens, you hear a clacking as the metallic limbs begin to move and sputter,
5293100	5296100	and several of them fly out of the door, lunging at you.
5297100	5298100	Uh-oh.
5298100	5299100	Yeah.
5299100	5300100	May I use my...
5301100	5302100	Perfect step.
5303100	5305100	You should use your...
5306100	5310100	May I use my flaming armor to melt the metal?
5310100	5316100	Yeah, so these limbs kind of lunge out, but they miss you as you activate...
5316100	5318100	Did I miss something awesome?
5318100	5319100	Yes.
5319100	5320100	Some of the audience says...
5320100	5324100	Someone said use your perfect skin to open the door.
5324100	5325100	That's pretty good.
5325100	5326100	That's pretty good.
5327100	5335100	Anyway, yeah, and then you activate your flaming armor and it starts to kind of melt these things a little bit.
5335100	5340100	Not melt so much as make them red hot, but it's kind of inflicting some sort of...
5340100	5342100	I mean, melting.
5343100	5344100	It's definitely increasing the temperature.
5344100	5345100	Let's say that.
5345100	5347100	You almost set damage.
5347100	5348100	Almost.
5348100	5349100	Oh, it's doing damage, too.
5349100	5350100	Okay.
5350100	5351100	But only eight.
5352100	5354100	Not bad for it doing nothing.
5355100	5356100	Well, I mean, it didn't do nothing.
5356100	5357100	It did eight damage.
5358100	5359100	Sharpie, what's outside your door?
5359100	5361100	Did you say there was stuff on the walls, too?
5361100	5367100	The walls are made of ice, like the other walls are made of stone except for these ice walls.
5367100	5368100	Okay.
5368100	5369100	I go up to my door.
5369100	5371100	I'm just going to give it a little open.
5371100	5372100	You know what?
5372100	5373100	A big open.
5374100	5378100	It swings open, reveals several frozen, intact corpses.
5378100	5380100	They look like adventurers.
5380100	5383100	Their bodies are adorned in fine items and equipments.
5383100	5384100	A jackpot.
5385100	5387100	And, of course, a tragedy.
5393100	5395100	What kind of fine items do I...
5395100	5396100	Yeah.
5396100	5397100	Do I just procure them?
5397100	5398100	Sure.
5398100	5403100	You procure four cloaks of resistance, four rings of protection, two boots of wintry might...
5403100	5406100	And a partridge and a pear tree.
5406100	5409100	Two boots of spry springing, one rod of frost...
5409100	5411100	One of that one dibs on that one instead.
5411100	5415100	One mighty greatsword, one whisper bow, and one assassin's ribbon dagger.
5415100	5416100	Well, I want that one.
5416100	5417100	I want that one.
5417100	5418100	Ribbon decker.
5418100	5420100	Is it rechargeable?
5420100	5424100	Guys, I found a bunch of shit!
5424100	5427100	Hey, I want dibs on some of that.
5427100	5430100	I got a big horn guy outside my door.
5430100	5431100	I don't care.
5431100	5432100	I got a dagger.
5432100	5433100	Fuck you.
5433100	5434100	Wait.
5434100	5435100	Wow.
5435100	5437100	You don't have a dagger.
5437100	5438100	Soon.
5438100	5439100	He has them all.
5439100	5440100	We have to get to him.
5440100	5441100	Yeah.
5441100	5442100	Are we connected?
5442100	5446100	Are these ice walls, like, the things that are keeping us from each other?
5446100	5447100	Who knows, man?
5447100	5452100	I take my flaming sword and I start slicing at the wall from the direction where I hear
5452100	5454100	my friend's voices coming from.
5454100	5456100	You see, Chris de Bourgh.
5456100	5457100	Hey!
5457100	5458100	I'm just kidding.
5458100	5459100	I didn't really mean fuck.
5459100	5460100	I'm sorry.
5460100	5461100	How's your dagger?
5461100	5463100	I don't have it yet.
5463100	5466100	I keep slicing through the walls until we find...
5466100	5467100	Mulrein.
5467100	5468100	Mulrein.
5468100	5469100	Hey!
5469100	5470100	Oh my god!
5470100	5471100	Oh my god!
5471100	5472100	Oh my god!
5472100	5473100	Oh my god!
5473100	5474100	Oh my god!
5474100	5475100	Totally fell!
5475100	5476100	Um...
5476100	5477100	Mulrein, you look great!
5477100	5478100	You look great.
5478100	5479100	Perfect skin.
5479100	5480100	Oh my god!
5480100	5481100	I try.
5481100	5482100	Okay.
5482100	5483100	Oh, she's a dork.
5483100	5484100	Oh, ah.
5484100	5489100	I learned it from watching you.
5489100	5492100	I learned it from watching you.
5492100	5495100	I keep slicing until we get to Sharpie.
5495100	5496100	Sharpie!
5496100	5497100	Sharpie!
5497100	5498100	Oh my god!
5498100	5499100	Hey!
5499100	5500100	Look at all that stuff!
5500100	5501100	Yeah, yeah.
5501100	5508100	Looks like you hate it.
5508100	5509100	Have at it, guys.
5509100	5513100	There's boots of shimmering, knives of plucking, shapes of resistance.
5513100	5514100	It's a...
5514100	5515100	A case of resistance.
5515100	5516100	Do they have any boots in my size?
5516100	5517100	I'm a size nine.
5517100	5518100	I think so.
5518100	5519100	Okay, nice.
5519100	5520100	Whoa, they do.
5520100	5521100	Yay!
5521100	5522100	Wait, so what was it?
5522100	5523100	That's so convenient.
5523100	5524100	What are the things we can all share?
5524100	5526100	There's four of a few things, right?
5527100	5530100	There's four cloaks of resistance and four rings of protection.
5530100	5531100	Sweet.
5531100	5532100	Resistance resists what?
5532100	5535100	I mean, stuff.
5535100	5538100	It gives you a bonus on your saving throws.
5538100	5539100	Versus?
5539100	5540100	Fun rules.
5540100	5542100	And what were the weapons?
5542100	5543100	Ah, what?
5543100	5544100	Oh, weapons.
5544100	5549100	A mighty greatsword, whisper bow, a ribbon dagger, and a rod of frost.
5549100	5551100	That sounds like one for each of us.
5551100	5552100	Oh, damn.
5552100	5553100	I'll do the rod of frost.
5553100	5554100	Weird.
5555100	5557100	Mowrein probably a whisper bow, right?
5557100	5558100	Probably.
5558100	5559100	Yeah.
5559100	5560100	Yeah, sure.
5560100	5561100	I have a question about this ribbon dagger.
5561100	5565100	Does it have a long ribbon attached to it in which maybe I could throw it and take it back?
5565100	5567100	Yeah, that's exactly it.
5567100	5570100	Oh, my God.
5570100	5574100	Scarecrow got a brain.
5574100	5578100	Christopher got a knife with a rope pre-tied to it.
5578100	5579100	All right.
5579100	5580100	It's amazing.
5580100	5581100	And what's the rod of frost?
5581100	5582100	Is that mine?
5582100	5584100	I would believe that would be mine.
5584100	5586100	You get the sword.
5586100	5587100	Mighty greatsword.
5587100	5588100	Oh, yeah.
5588100	5589100	Tell me about the mighty greatsword.
5589100	5591100	It's super mighty.
5591100	5594100	Hey, guys, I got a mighty sword.
5594100	5595100	That's adorable.
5595100	5596100	Thank you.
5596100	5597100	Yay.
5597100	5599100	It's like bigger than the last one.
5599100	5600100	All right.
5600100	5601100	Let's take it.
5601100	5602100	Pretty.
5602100	5603100	Pretty.
5603100	5604100	How much larger is it than him now?
5604100	5606100	Like, let's see.
5606100	5609100	The last one was roughly 25% longer than him.
5609100	5613100	I would say this one's at least 35% longer than him.
5613100	5615100	I'd say if you're, like, 3 foot 3 inches,
5615100	5618100	then this one would have to be, you know, the math.
5618100	5620100	Do the math.
5620100	5622100	4 foot 2 inches.
5622100	5624100	All right.
5624100	5626100	Sarah, way people can bookmark this part of the podcast
5626100	5631100	so they can just skip right to it.
5631100	5635100	I don't know if that technology exists, but...
5635100	5638100	If we have to invent it, can I suggest for a name,
5638100	5642100	a highlight finder?
5642100	5645100	Thrill seeker.
5645100	5646100	Some new...
5646100	5648100	All right.
5648100	5651100	And about my rod of Raphrost?
5651100	5655100	You get the sense that it cast cold spells.
5655100	5656100	Yeah.
5656100	5658100	It would take, like, a day to study it,
5658100	5662100	but once that day's over, who boy?
5662100	5665100	And these cloaks of resistance can be donned without me
5665100	5668100	having to choose to take off anything else, right?
5668100	5671100	Like, I just have my wizardly robes.
5671100	5676100	Yeah, I mean, you have a cape, like your dad's cape.
5676100	5679100	I think those kind are in the same place.
5679100	5681100	Can you wear two capes?
5681100	5682100	I mean...
5682100	5683100	Oh, my dad's cape?
5683100	5685100	It's like a teleportation cape.
5685100	5686100	Oh, yeah.
5686100	5689100	It's just not charged or...?
5689100	5691100	No, it recharges once per day,
5691100	5694100	and you tried to use it twice per day and forgot about it.
5694100	5697100	Wait, you had a teleportation cape?
5697100	5698100	Yeah, yeah.
5698100	5701100	In my defense, I finally remembered I had a bird.
5701100	5704100	How about you grab us all and teleport out of this hole?
5704100	5706100	Everybody go through your shit.
5706100	5709100	Let's all take inventory real quick.
5709100	5712100	Wait, you had a teleportation cape this whole time?
5712100	5714100	Yes, Lisette.
5714100	5717100	Don't you also have a staff that, like, grows to climb out on it?
5717100	5718100	Yeah.
5718100	5720100	Okay.
5720100	5723100	Hey, Dan, you're holding out on us, man.
5723100	5725100	I mean Sharpie.
5725100	5727100	Can I remind you guys that the reason you found all this shit
5727100	5730100	is because I forgot I had all that stuff?
5732100	5734100	What are you going to say next time?
5734100	5737100	If we hadn't gotten our asses kicked five times before now,
5737100	5739100	we wouldn't even be here.
5739100	5742100	It's called the butterfly theory effect.
5742100	5743100	Look it up.
5743100	5745100	I don't know. I like the way you guys are looking at me.
5745100	5746100	Hey, that was an Ashton Kutcher movie.
5746100	5748100	Yeah, Ashton Kutcher reference.
5748100	5749100	There you go.
5749100	5750100	All right.
5751100	5754100	I'm going to take that climbing rod that I have.
5754100	5756100	Should we get out of here?
5756100	5758100	Over beneath the hole that I fell through?
5758100	5759100	Wait.
5759100	5761100	There's a staircase behind the blue imp.
5761100	5763100	Should we check this out before we go?
5763100	5765100	Yeah, we need our skeletons anyway.
5765100	5766100	We have them.
5766100	5767100	We told them to get up.
5767100	5769100	We rally our skeletons and we walk through
5769100	5772100	Christoperg's door towards the blue imp staircase.
5772100	5774100	It's like the least threatening.
5774100	5776100	Yeah.
5776100	5778100	What happens?
5779100	5780100	Oh, that's me.
5780100	5782100	I walk into the room with the blue imp and I say,
5782100	5783100	hey, shithead.
5783100	5784100	I brought my friends.
5784100	5785100	Come on.
5785100	5786100	Yeah.
5786100	5788100	So he's still flitting around on those bat wings.
5788100	5790100	He's still on the other side of the chamber,
5790100	5792100	is that staircase, as I mentioned.
5792100	5793100	God damn it.
5793100	5795100	But he begins spinning around like a top in midair.
5795100	5798100	He causes a rapid wind to whip up
5798100	5801100	and it starts blowing around the room.
5801100	5804100	Soon chunks of ice and snow are beginning to be lifted up
5804100	5806100	off the floor and the walls.
5806100	5808100	They're pulling off the walls and they're flying
5808100	5811100	towards the demon and casing them in ice and snow.
5811100	5813100	It keeps building up and building up until it looks
5813100	5817100	like a giant snowflake floating around in the air.
5817100	5820100	We should kill that thing.
5820100	5825100	You referenced the demon.
5825100	5826100	Yeah.
5826100	5828100	So there's this blue imp demon.
5828100	5832100	He's sucking in elements and turning into this other thing.
5832100	5834100	Now he's a snowflake.
5834100	5835100	Hold on.
5835100	5838100	I'm on conflict resolution for a moment, Tyler.
5838100	5839100	I tried.
5839100	5840100	He didn't listen to me.
5840100	5841100	No, no, no.
5841100	5842100	I saw the subreddit.
5842100	5843100	Everyone jacking you off.
5843100	5846100	You're the best D&D player in the world.
5846100	5847100	You did very well.
5847100	5848100	Shane, sorry.
5848100	5850100	I'm trying to do more terrible.
5850100	5852100	I'm not trying to show you up.
5852100	5854100	I'm expressing my jealousy.
5854100	5856100	I'm just saying.
5856100	5857100	I love you.
5857100	5859100	I kneel in front of the snowflake
5859100	5870100	and I say in three different languages, hello.
5870100	5872100	Now that's how you do it, Tyler.
5872100	5873100	Wait.
5873100	5874100	Does one of us have one of us amulet of frost?
5874100	5875100	That's one of us.
5875100	5876100	Me.
5876100	5877100	You.
5877100	5878100	Maybe you can stop it.
5878100	5879100	No.
5879100	5880100	You can control the ice.
5880100	5882100	Can you stop this terrible thing from happening?
5882100	5884100	I can calm and intensify hail, sleet, and snow.
5884100	5887100	You can calm this piece of thing before it kills us.
5887100	5889100	Let's see what happens with his hello.
5889100	5890100	Go for it first.
5890100	5896100	You see a central spot in the middle of the snowflake kind of glow blue.
5896100	5897100	Yeah?
5897100	5899100	Yeah.
5899100	5901100	That means hello back?
5901100	5902100	Who knows, man?
5902100	5903100	You don't speak still.
5903100	5909100	I use my amulet of winter to calm this thing.
5909100	5911100	It's flown in the air.
5911100	5915100	You use your armulet and it continues to float in the air.
5915100	5916100	I say to it.
5916100	5920100	I don't know if you can communicate with us, but I'm making the assumption that you,
5920100	5926100	like us, are prisoners in this dungeon, that you ran afoul of Admiral Darkstar and that
5926100	5930100	you might be able to help us defeat him.
5930100	5937100	It's the central spot in its, you know, center of mass kind of turns red and it starts spinning
5937100	5940100	around like a saw blade.
5940100	5941100	All right.
5941100	5944100	I guess let's kill it.
5944100	5945100	Yeah.
5946100	5947100	Yeah.
5947100	5948100	Let's kill it.
5948100	5949100	Use that ribbon thing you got.
5949100	5950100	Oh yeah.
5950100	5955100	I want to, can I throw my dagger at it with the ribbon on it?
5955100	5956100	I want to use the ribbon dagger.
5956100	5957100	Okay.
5957100	5958100	Just, yeah.
5958100	5960100	Use that ribbon dagger.
5960100	5962100	You've never used one of these before.
5962100	5963100	Okay.
5963100	5965100	So you're not, you're not.
5965100	5966100	Oh yeah.
5966100	5967100	Yes.
5967100	5968100	You're right.
5968100	5969100	He's using a shittier version to that before.
5969100	5970100	Yeah.
5970100	5971100	I'm all over it.
5971100	5972100	It's fine.
5972100	5973100	They got different weights.
5973100	5974100	That's how this stuff works.
5974100	5978100	Anyway, it does hit him for anyone wondering.
5978100	5981100	Can I pull it back?
5981100	5982100	Yeah.
5982100	5983100	Yeah.
5983100	5984100	That happens.
5984100	5985100	I want to do that.
5985100	5986100	You deal one damage.
5986100	5987100	Yeah.
5987100	5991100	Suck it nerd.
5991100	5993100	Mighty far sword attack.
5993100	5996100	I think you have your far sword for the day used up.
5996100	5997100	Oh shit.
5997100	5998100	Yeah.
5998100	5999100	They cut through the wall.
5999100	6000100	Yeah.
6001100	6005100	Let's just, I'll take out my, is it floating in the air above me?
6005100	6006100	Yeah.
6006100	6008100	You might be able to jump up there, but it'll be a bit of an exertion.
6008100	6009100	You want a boost?
6009100	6010100	Yeah.
6010100	6014100	I get on top of Christopher's shoulders and we run like a chicken fight.
6014100	6022100	I go in there wielding my new sword and say, take a piece of this snowflake.
6022100	6029100	I heard you're not the same as all of your counterparts, but the pain I inflict will be
6029100	6030100	identical.
6030100	6033100	I give a thumbs up to Sharpie.
6033100	6034100	I'm workshopping it.
6034100	6035100	I'm workshopping it.
6035100	6040100	By the time I get there, have the joke punched up.
6040100	6047100	I throw my snowflake related quips to a room, a writer's room.
6047100	6051100	Your clips get workshopped and so you're giving this thumbs up.
6051100	6057100	It kind of throws off your chicken stack of adventurers balance and you just kind of topple
6057100	6058100	to the ground.
6058100	6062100	It's hard to balance and thumbs up and stab people.
6062100	6063100	Okay.
6063100	6064100	I run back and regroup.
6064100	6065100	Yeah.
6065100	6066100	Oh shit.
6066100	6067100	Okay.
6067100	6068100	May I do something?
6068100	6069100	Yep.
6069100	6070100	Yeah.
6070100	6071100	May I throw three flaming arrows at the snowflake?
6071100	6072100	You want to throw arrows?
6072100	6073100	That's a bad idea.
6073100	6074100	Use your bow.
6074100	6075100	Use your new bow.
6075100	6076100	Wait.
6076100	6077100	Wait.
6077100	6078100	You don't know what it is yet.
6078100	6079100	Whisper bow.
6079100	6080100	Yeah.
6080100	6081100	Yeah.
6081100	6082100	You should try your new bow.
6082100	6083100	Wait.
6083100	6084100	Why are we whispering?
6084100	6085100	I don't want to talk about it.
6085100	6087100	I can't hear what's happening.
6087100	6093660	May I use my whisper bow to throw three fire arrows at the snowflake?
6093660	6096100	Your whisper bow can only fire two arrows.
6096100	6097100	That's fine.
6097100	6098100	I'm not, I'm not picky.
6098100	6100100	Do you want to make them flaming arrows?
6100100	6101100	Yes.
6101100	6102100	Yes.
6102100	6107460	One of your arrows strikes hitting its mark.
6107460	6112660	Mark being the snowflake in this instance.
6113660	6114660	It deals seven damage.
6114660	6115660	Nice.
6115660	6116660	Go ahead.
6116660	6117660	Good.
6117660	6122060	You see some of the ice kind of melt and drip off onto the floor.
6122060	6125660	That's what fire does to ice.
6125660	6126660	Sharpie?
6126660	6127660	Scorching ray.
6127660	6129660	Scorching ray.
6129660	6136660	It strikes directly in its center of mass in that glowing red eyeball part I was mentioning.
6136660	6137660	Sweet.
6137660	6139660	And it deals 13 damage.
6139660	6140660	Nice.
6141660	6148060	It continues its rapid spinning and it kind of spins around the whole room attempting
6148060	6151660	to slice into your torsos slash mid sections.
6151660	6156660	I mean, what'd you expect?
6156660	6158660	Not bad.
6158660	6161660	I tried to make friends with it.
6161660	6163660	I don't even know.
6163660	6173460	Um, so Mulrane and Krista Berg each get struck and they each take, well Krista Berg takes
6173460	6177660	12 damage and Mulrane takes six.
6177660	6178660	Fuck.
6178660	6179660	It's dark damage.
6179660	6180660	This isn't, it's fine.
6180660	6181660	It's fine.
6181660	6182660	You're all cut up.
6182660	6183660	That's your fault.
6183660	6184660	Yeah.
6184660	6185660	I gotta, listen.
6185660	6186660	Try the ribbon dagger again.
6186660	6187660	You're getting good at it.
6187660	6188660	It did one damage?
6188660	6189660	This doesn't seem like.
6189660	6190660	You're getting good at it.
6190660	6191660	It's like a slap machine.
6191660	6192660	It's gonna pay off now.
6192660	6193660	I know.
6193660	6196660	You got it warmed up.
6196660	6197660	This is the worst idea.
6197660	6198660	Yeah.
6198660	6199660	Let's just do the ribbon dagger again.
6199660	6200660	Why not?
6200660	6201660	What could go wrong?
6201660	6202660	Critical hit.
6202660	6203660	Oh.
6203660	6204660	Fine.
6204660	6205660	Whatever, you guys.
6205660	6206660	Whatever.
6209660	6210660	Dealing four damage.
6210660	6211660	Yeah.
6214660	6217660	We use the two critical loosely here.
6220660	6221660	Is that me?
6221660	6222660	I put it at you.
6222660	6223660	Okay.
6223660	6224660	I get back on Christoper's shoulder as I go.
6224660	6225660	Let's try this again.
6225660	6226660	Okay.
6226660	6227660	One more time.
6227660	6228660	All right.
6228660	6229660	What's my line?
6229660	6230660	I need a snowflake line.
6230660	6231660	Oh, shit.
6231660	6232660	Chill out.
6232660	6233660	Chill out?
6233660	6234660	Okay.
6234660	6235660	Okay.
6235660	6236660	I get on.
6236660	6239160	I get on Christoper's shoulders and I take out my flaming sword and I kind of spur him
6239160	6240160	like he's a horse.
6240160	6241160	Don't fuck.
6241160	6242160	Why?
6242160	6243160	That hurts.
6243160	6244160	Don't.
6244160	6245160	What are you doing?
6245160	6246160	It's lightly, you know.
6246160	6247160	Shit.
6247160	6248160	I'm running.
6248160	6249160	Sorry.
6249160	6250160	We start running at him and I say, chill out.
6251160	6253160	An attack with my flaming sword.
6253160	6256160	Your attack hits or...
6256160	6258160	I don't know.
6258160	6259160	I'll leave.
6260160	6261160	Wow.
6261160	6262160	Yeah.
6262160	6266160	Your attack lands a lot better than your bad pun.
6268160	6270160	Or your delivery.
6270160	6274160	Or my execution of that attempt of jokes.
6274160	6276160	Or that execution.
6276160	6278160	Dealing 14 damage.
6279160	6280160	Yeah.
6280160	6288160	You see a chunk of ice kind of fall off of his body and I get a snowflake into the ground.
6288160	6289160	Yeah.
6289160	6290160	It's as if it's made of ice.
6290160	6292160	How much of it is left?
6292160	6293160	Most of it.
6293160	6294160	Shit.
6294160	6300160	I say, I keep writing on Christoper and as I look back with my sword in the air I go,
6300160	6302160	welcome to Meltdown.
6302160	6308160	I throw him onto the ground.
6308160	6309160	Oh.
6309160	6311160	I like that one.
6311160	6314160	Putting it at Mulrain's turn.
6314160	6316160	Can I try to talk to the snowflake?
6316160	6317160	Yeah.
6317160	6319160	We've already determined that communication has failed.
6319160	6321160	At least Dan trying to talk to has failed.
6321160	6322160	I don't know.
6322160	6323160	Yeah, that doesn't really work.
6323160	6325160	Can I try speaking in elf?
6325160	6326160	Yeah.
6326160	6327160	Maybe it's an elvish snowflake.
6327160	6328160	Yeah, go for it.
6328160	6329160	What do you want to say in elf?
6329160	6330160	Can you tell it?
6330160	6333160	Can you tell?
6333160	6334160	Can you tell?
6334160	6335160	What?
6335160	6336160	Can you please tell the snowflake?
6336160	6338160	I think it's very pretty.
6338160	6342160	As you begin speaking in elven, the snowflake doesn't respond.
6342160	6344160	The whisper bow, however, does.
6344160	6347160	And you can see there's runes on its surface you couldn't notice before.
6347160	6352160	They're beginning to glow and light up as a response to your elven speech.
6352160	6354160	In your face, Christoper.
6354160	6357160	Whatever.
6357160	6358160	The snowflake is an elvish.
6358160	6359160	The snowflake is an elvish.
6359160	6360160	That was my...
6360160	6363160	It's kind of a new will they, won't they kind of element going on here.
6363160	6364160	Yeah.
6364160	6368160	It's kind of a weird Sam and Diane sexual tension here.
6368160	6373160	I think the gay people in the audience want to know in this relationship who would be...
6373160	6375160	Who would plan the wedding?
6375160	6377160	He certainly dresses better than I do.
6377160	6378160	I don't know.
6378160	6381160	It's tucks in a barrel that call back.
6381160	6384160	It's still your turn though.
6384160	6389160	You're just talking an elvish so that doesn't take up a turn.
6389160	6395160	Whisper to your bow and elven and make its arrows fly true.
6395160	6398160	May I use one more arrow to...
6398160	6399160	You can shoot two.
6399160	6400160	It's a new turn.
6400160	6401160	Oh, great.
6401160	6404160	Two new arrows, flaming arrows on my whisper bow, please.
6404160	6405160	Yeah.
6405160	6409160	You fired the flaming arrows from your whisper bow.
6409160	6415160	Both of them strike their mark, plunging deep into the snowflake.
6415160	6416160	Dealing.
6416160	6417160	We're fighting a snowflake.
6417160	6419160	Yeah, you are.
6426160	6428160	Dealing, 33 damage.
6428160	6430160	What the hell?
6432160	6435160	You should talk to your bow more.
6436160	6437160	Dealing.
6437160	6438160	That was what did it.
6438160	6439160	Talking to your bow.
6439160	6440160	You're right.
6440160	6441160	I got this.
6441160	6442160	We're good.
6442160	6445160	They strike into the snowflake and it bursts into flame and it kind of melts and you see
6445160	6448160	a charred imp kind of plop to the floor.
6448160	6449160	Yeah.
6449160	6453160	Then your bow kind of fades in color, like goes back to normal.
6453160	6459160	I walk up to the imp and I say, ice to fuck you.
6461160	6462160	Ice to fuck you?
6462160	6466160	I didn't want to say, I used to see you because we already saw him.
6466160	6467160	Ice to meet you.
6467160	6468160	Ice to beat you.
6468160	6469160	Ice to beat you.
6469160	6470160	Ice to beat you.
6471160	6473160	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town.
6475160	6476160	Ice to beat you.
6476160	6478160	Ice to beat all of you.
6478160	6481160	One more time for Tyler and Lizette, everybody.
6481160	6482160	Thank you, Tyler.
6482160	6483160	Thank you, Lizette.
6486160	6488160	Spencer Creighton.
6489160	6490160	Thank you, sir.
6491160	6492160	I'm Jeff Davis.
6492160	6494160	One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6495160	6498160	Shout out to Spencer's mom who's also here.
6498160	6499160	Spencer's mom is here.
6504160	6505160	Spencer's mom's here.
6505160	6506160	Yeah.
6506160	6507160	Hello, Spencer's mom.
6508160	6509160	Thank you all.
6509160	6510160	We love you.
6510160	6511160	Goodnight.
