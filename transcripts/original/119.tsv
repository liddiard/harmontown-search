0	7000	Please give a big round of applause to director Neil Berkley, Dan Harmon, Spencer Crittenden,
7000	13040	all the fine folks who made that movie. And your guest comptroller for
13040	18040	harmontown tonight is Camille Najani here. Where's Camille?
18040	22040	Camille. There he is.
30040	35040	And Dan, Dan, etc. There's our boy.
35040	45040	Alright, yeah, we're kind of making the format up as we go.
45040	47040	Oh, okay. So should I do the thing?
47040	50040	I don't know. You could Q&A for a second while we come home.
50040	51040	Are we recording for the podcast?
51040	52040	Yes.
52040	53040	Are we recording?
53040	55040	Well then I'm going to get the hell out of here.
55040	60040	Do you want the Q&A to be part of, we could do it as part of the podcast.
60040	62040	Do we do Q&A and then do the podcast?
62040	66040	That's what we did in Seattle. I'm just worried that they watched a two-hour movie,
66040	68040	then they're going to sit through the Q&A.
68040	70040	We could do the Q&A as part of the podcast.
70040	71040	Okay, let's do that.
71040	74040	Alright, so I'm going to introduce you.
74040	79040	Pretend he's not here because the fuckers at home don't have visuals.
79040	82040	And then he's going to walk out when I introduce him.
82040	89040	Imagine me having really long, nice legs. Yeah, he looks beautiful.
90040	92040	Hey, everyone.
92040	95040	Hormontown is now in session.
95040	100040	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon.
104040	107040	Oh, God. Los Angeles.
107040	109040	Oh, God. I can't believe I found you here.
109040	111040	Wow, you got up here pretty quickly.
111040	112040	Thank you.
112040	117040	Guest Comptroller Camille Nangiani, everybody.
117040	120040	He's back from Silicon Valley.
120040	122040	He's not back. You're taking a break, right?
122040	124040	Are you halfway through shooting?
124040	126040	No, we're going to start shooting season two soon.
126040	127040	We haven't started yet.
127040	129040	Oh, you haven't started yet?
129040	132040	We've been kind of just fucking around.
132040	133040	I don't know what they're doing.
133040	135040	Think writing or something?
135040	139040	We changed the words when we sang.
139040	141040	That's a lie. They're amazing.
141040	145040	Hormontown fans will agree with me that I missed you so much.
145040	147040	Oh, yeah, I've been gone a long time.
147040	150040	The podcast people, anyway.
150040	156040	He's not in the movie, but the podcast itself really languishes in your absence.
156040	158040	Oh, I'm sure that's not true, but I appreciate you saying that.
158040	161040	Yeah, I really miss doing it.
161040	163040	Every Sunday, I would be like,
163040	170040	Oh, right now, Hormontown is happening, and I'm alone in a horrible hotel room.
170040	172040	So you think about me?
172040	174040	I think about the show. I don't...
174040	177040	I mean, I think of the show as a whole, as an entity separate from you.
177040	180040	You're in your bed next to your wife.
180040	183040	My wife wasn't with me when I was, but...
183040	185040	It's all the better.
185040	188040	I think of Hormont. I think of Jeff. I think of Spencer.
188040	190040	Don't think about Jeff.
190040	192040	Think about me.
192040	194040	So we just watched this documentary.
194040	196040	Oh, yeah, we watched the documentary.
196040	198040	Did you really? That's not the first time.
198040	200040	Yeah, it was awesome. It's really funny.
200040	202040	Yeah, we're here in L.A. for you podcast listeners.
202040	204040	We were at the Vista Theater in Los Feliz.
208040	210040	And we just watched the Hormontown documentary,
210040	215040	which is why my self-loathing is being really...
215040	218040	They watched a two-hour movie about this shit.
218040	220040	Now they're sitting here.
220040	222040	We didn't have a bathroom break.
222040	224040	I'm really self-conscious right now.
224040	226040	I don't know what to do.
226040	228040	I think people are going to get up and slowly file out.
228040	230040	I wouldn't blame them if they did.
230040	232040	No, they love the movie.
232040	234040	I know they did.
234040	238040	I know they did, but they have families. They have lives.
238040	242040	They don't have families. Did you watch your movie?
242040	244040	This is the family.
244040	248040	So we were asking in Seattle what we did as we showed the movie,
248040	250040	then we did a Q&A, then we did the podcast.
250040	253040	Seattle was awesome, by the way, for our friends in Seattle.
253040	255040	You were amazing. Dino guest-controlled.
255040	258040	He dropped the end bomb right at the end of the show,
258040	259040	just because he hadn't.
259040	261040	By the way, that's a great time to drop it.
261040	263040	It's towards the end.
263040	266040	I thought the remarkable cultural revolution that happened in Seattle
266040	269040	is Dino did that, and the Seattle audience kind of just went...
269040	271040	Eh.
271040	274040	Black, white. They didn't care.
274040	277040	They were like, eh, I'm not going to let that hijack or anything.
277040	280040	Well, they'd seen a two-hour documentary and then a whole show and a Q&A.
280040	282040	They had to go to the bathroom.
282040	284040	Maybe. I don't know.
284040	286040	The message I got from them was, yeah, edit it out.
286040	288040	Don't let it fuck everything up.
288040	289040	Did you edit it out?
289040	290040	Yeah, I did.
290040	291040	Are you going to edit this out?
291040	292040	No.
292040	294040	Because it's boring?
294040	295040	No.
295040	299040	No, because now, if you put this out, people will know that he used the end bomb.
299040	300040	No, no, no, no.
300040	303040	I actually specifically want the people in Seattle to know, those 200 people.
303040	306040	I want you to know it wasn't a shame-based edit.
306040	310040	It was like a kind of actually answering your call to adventure
310040	314040	because they sat there and were like, yeah, fuck that.
314040	316040	We're not going to let that...
316040	319040	You know, who cares? It's a dumb word.
319040	321040	How do you guys feel about it?
321040	322040	No, don't ask.
322040	324040	Don't applaud. That feels weird.
324040	325040	Let's try.
325040	328040	On the count of three, let's say the N-word together and see how they react.
328040	329040	No, I can only say it...
329040	332040	And you guys don't react. Don't react.
332040	333040	Be better than Seattle.
333040	335040	One, two...
335040	337040	Okay, all right.
337040	341040	I could say it if I say the word sand before it.
341040	342040	You're allowed to.
342040	345040	That's in all your people's music.
345040	348040	Yeah, what's up, my friend?
348040	350040	Boo to the bull.
350040	353040	Oh, yeah. Oh, one, two, one, two.
353040	354040	Yo.
354040	356040	Is that my people's music?
356040	358040	I'm trying to improvise Muslim rap, yeah.
358040	359040	That's our call to prayer.
359040	361040	Like an actual Muslim rap.
361040	366040	Hey, remember right after 9-11 when all the Muslim rappers kind of just got really quiet?
366040	368040	Do you remember that?
368040	369040	Who were the Muslim rappers?
369040	370040	Well, I don't know.
370040	374040	I remember there was a lot of bow ties and a lot of anger in the 9-11
374040	377040	and I was like, okay, well, rap's one thing.
377040	379040	9-11's another.
379040	382040	I just remember it got really quiet really fast.
382040	385040	Yeah, I mean, a lot of shit was going on after 9-11.
385040	389040	I'm sure among them was that the Muslim rappers were like,
389040	391040	we're going to lay low for a little bit.
391040	392040	Yeah.
392040	394040	The album is ready to go, but context has changed.
394040	396040	I thought it was kind of funny.
396040	397040	So should we...
397040	399040	Do you guys have any questions?
399040	400040	Just raise your hand.
400040	403040	We're going to do the Q&A as part of the thing.
403040	405040	Yeah, you guys could raise your hand.
405040	406040	I'll call...
406040	407040	How about this?
407040	410040	You guys can come and line up over here and then we could just go one by one.
410040	411040	What do you think?
411040	412040	Yep.
412040	413040	Yeah, so if you guys...
413040	417040	Yeah, we'll set that out there and you guys can come line up if you have questions
417040	420040	and ask questions.
420040	423040	We should bring other people that are going to be on.
423040	424040	We should bring them on, right?
424040	427040	We should bring Spencer out and we should bring every...
427040	429040	Spencer, get up here.
429040	436040	Like a gazelle.
436040	441040	I'm going to sit here instead.
441040	442040	Yay.
442040	443040	Yay.
443040	444040	Yay.
444040	445040	Hey, guys.
445040	446040	Well, I don't know.
446040	449040	No, we were doing the podcast.
449040	450040	Oh, okay.
450040	451040	All right.
451040	456040	So do you have any questions?
456040	457040	These guys get it.
457040	458040	They're hip crowd.
458040	459040	Well, we don't get it.
459040	460040	How are they supposed to get it?
460040	461040	We don't get it.
461040	462040	Because they get us.
462040	463040	All right.
463040	467040	Anyway, if there's any questions about the documentary you just saw...
467040	472040	You could go line up over there and then we can...
472040	474040	Is one person a line?
474040	476040	I just feel like it needs to be a new town.
476040	477040	It's a line segment.
477040	478040	It's Toby from The Office.
478040	479040	Everybody loves him.
479040	485040	Sorry visually, that doesn't land.
485040	486040	What's your name, sir?
486040	487040	My name is Braden.
487040	488040	Braden?
488040	489040	Yep.
489040	490040	What's your question, Braden?
490040	493040	So, this is for Dan.
493040	498040	Did you have any decision making in what went into the film?
498040	503040	And if not, what would you set the record straight on?
503040	509040	I insisted that Neil put the pedophilia as an option if you have the gumption tongue twister
509040	510040	in.
510040	514040	He didn't put it in and I was like, I was really funny in that moment.
514040	516040	I improvised alliteration.
516040	519040	Do you have any idea how difficult that is?
519040	524040	The joke was socially unacceptable tongue twister.
524040	525040	Yeah.
525040	526040	And I nailed it.
526040	528040	Put it in the movie.
528040	532040	And Neil was like, well, the chat, you know, Phoenix, you know, it's like...
532040	534040	We've already done Crip Death.
534040	536040	This feels like a whole other thing.
536040	537040	Crip Death was my offer.
537040	538040	I took it.
538040	540040	I made the touchdown.
540040	541040	Right.
541040	542040	Yeah.
543040	544040	Crip Death was the assist.
544040	545040	You were the slam dunk.
545040	546040	Yeah.
546040	547040	Alley-oop.
547040	548040	And it doesn't work.
548040	549040	No one laughs at it.
549040	550040	No.
550040	551040	I thought it was great.
551040	553040	I was very proud of myself.
553040	554040	That was about it, really.
554040	558040	I just kept telling him, put the pedophile joke back in the movie.
558040	560040	You keep leaving it out.
560040	561040	I don't know what to tell you.
561040	566040	That might be the first time that that note has been given.
566040	568040	I mean, there were several cuts of the movie.
568040	571040	I had to make an agreement with Neil.
571040	573040	The guy you're gesturing to didn't ask that question.
573040	574040	It wasn't me.
574040	575040	Oh.
575040	576040	He just sat down.
576040	577040	Brayden sat down.
577040	578040	All right.
578040	579040	Sorry.
579040	583040	Brayden was the hype man who was pointing him out, though.
583040	584040	Yeah.
584040	588040	I had to let the director know, do not.
588040	589040	It's my tour.
589040	590040	It's his movie.
590040	591040	So come what may.
591040	593040	And he was very respectful.
593040	595040	Somebody shouted something out.
595040	598040	Can we or did we?
599040	600040	What did they say?
600040	602040	They want us to bring the director on.
602040	603040	Oh, well, yeah.
603040	605040	The director's mom is obviously in the audience.
605040	607040	And she's very proud.
607040	610040	I mean, please, please understand, ma'am.
610040	611040	It's a very confusing time.
611040	613040	We didn't know if it was a Q&A or a podcast.
613040	615040	And we don't know what we're doing.
615040	616040	But you're right.
616040	617040	You're absolutely right.
617040	618040	He made it.
618040	621040	Even though you're only saying that because you gave birth to him.
621040	623040	We should probably bring the director.
623040	626040	We should wait until she should go stand in line.
626040	630040	And then when it's her turn.
630040	632040	But that's if it's just a Q&A.
632040	635040	If it's harm in town, if she can just wander up and go,
635040	636040	I want to eat your face.
636040	639040	I mean, that's what we've learned about the show.
639040	641040	So, Neil, come up here.
641040	646040	Will you come up here, Neil, please?
646040	648040	Is that actually Neil's mom?
648040	649040	No.
649040	650040	No, of course not.
650040	651040	I'm just trying to take away.
651040	652040	She's not very proud.
652040	654040	She is sitting next to Neil.
654040	656040	So I thought it might be a...
656040	657040	What, Neil's mom?
657040	658040	Is it actually here?
658040	659040	Your mom's not here.
659040	660040	No, it's not her mom.
660040	661040	No, Neil hates his mom.
661040	662040	He's a filmmaker.
662040	666040	That was Shannon Russo, wife of EP Joe Russo.
666040	667040	They did that.
667040	668040	Thank you.
668040	669040	Shannon.
669040	670040	Yes, sir.
670040	671040	Oh, yeah.
671040	674040	First of all, I love the movie.
674040	679040	I'll just say that up front.
679040	683040	My question, I myself have just finished a lengthy road trip as well.
683040	689040	So when you were on your road trip, were there any depths of personal hygiene that
689040	693040	you sank to that surprised you?
693040	694040	Wait, can I...
694040	701040	I'm glad I'm here because I was asked several times other moments that weren't on camera.
701040	705040	You've told the story before, but one story from the road that always makes me laugh,
705040	711040	like I laughed about it this day, was when we broke down and you went back to get fries,
712040	713040	remember that?
713040	714040	The McDonald's fries.
714040	716040	When the engine broke down?
716040	717040	Yeah.
717040	722040	And we got In-N-Out fries and you weren't satisfied, so you went back to get McDonald's fries.
724040	726040	That totally sounds like a rock bottom.
726040	727040	Wait, no.
729040	732040	It's not a hygiene thing, but you hid them in the bag and went in the bus because you
732040	734040	got a corner pounder as well.
734040	737040	Yeah, I was shame eating in the bus.
737040	740040	You wanted people to think you were eating In-N-Out, but you're just eating...
740040	741040	I hid McDonald's fries.
741040	743040	I hid McDonald's fries in the In-N-Out bag, yeah.
743040	747040	Wait, so the best you could hope for was that people thinking you're eating slightly
747040	749040	less shitty fast food?
749040	750040	Yeah, I just...
750040	753040	I think at the time I was supposed to be on a diet with Aaron and I think...
753040	754040	So In-N-Out was part of the diet?
754040	755040	I don't know.
755040	756040	I don't know.
756040	757040	I can't remember.
757040	758040	I remember going...
758040	760040	No, you didn't like your enough fries.
760040	762040	You're like, I'm going to go get some real fries.
762040	765040	So you went to McDonald's and you bought fries, but you also bought a quarter pounder and
765040	769040	a milkshake, and you put them all in the same bag and went in the bus and ate by yourself.
770040	771040	Oh, yeah.
771040	772040	I'm sorry.
772040	773040	No, it's fine.
773040	780040	It feels a little bit like you're just picking on the fat kid, but I'm sure you're a movie
780040	781040	maker.
781040	786040	It was going to be either that or the pedophilia joke was going to be in the movie.
786040	789040	Yes, guys, I ate extra fries.
789040	791040	What's your name?
791040	792040	Cameron.
792040	796040	Cameron, it seems like you had some depth you wanted to tell us about.
796040	798040	How do you know when you have a fake name?
798040	799040	My name really is Cameron.
799040	801040	Well, if your name's Cameron, that's a good sign.
801040	803040	I don't know.
803040	809040	I was just in my head thinking either it was having Wendy's three times in one day or
809040	814040	not changing clothes for the first three days of the road trip.
814040	816040	Well, what's your question?
816040	817040	You already asked it.
817040	820040	What were the depths of...
820040	821040	That was just me.
821040	822040	Yeah.
822040	825040	But the question was, what were the depths of...
825040	826040	Oh, the hygiene.
826040	827040	Yeah.
827040	828040	Yeah.
828040	835040	Honestly, I think when I'm moving, I probably shower more than usual, which is still not
835040	836040	a lot.
836040	841040	I think that when I'm stationary and I have a person that loves me, that's when I really
841040	842040	push the limits.
842040	848880	Like right now, there's like, I don't know, wallpaper peeling.
848880	850960	I haven't showered in a long time.
850960	851960	When was the last time you showered?
851960	853540	I have no idea.
853540	854880	No memory of it.
854880	856200	Don't remember.
856200	860040	The water stings my skin and it hurts.
860040	862040	It hurts my skin.
862040	865600	I know that the rest of you get into the shower, you like the feeling of it.
865600	868680	And that's why you're not heroes for doing it.
868680	873720	It's weird that you get out of something that you like and then come and find people like
873720	880160	me and make fun of us because we're all just doing what we want to do.
880160	883880	Sometimes you like to play basketball, sometimes you like to take a shower, then you come find
883880	884880	me.
884880	887560	How many hours did you take this month, bro?
887560	888720	I don't know.
888720	891960	Just guess or I'll punch you.
891960	893480	I don't know, three?
893480	896080	Three in a month?
896080	899000	That's either too many or too little.
899000	900000	I don't know.
900000	901000	I don't know.
901000	902000	I don't know.
902000	903080	I don't know.
903080	906720	Every day is Babylon five.
906720	908400	I don't know who you are.
908400	910360	I don't know what you want from me.
910360	915240	How many times should I shower to make you happy?
915240	917120	Three.
917120	918120	Fuck you.
918120	919120	Fuck you.
919120	920120	I don't like it.
920120	921480	It stings my skin.
921480	922480	I like to take baths.
922480	926360	I like to submerge myself in hot, soapy water.
926360	928560	It takes a long time.
928560	932760	I don't do that a lot either.
932760	934400	I think that answers your question, Cameron.
934400	935400	Thank you very much, Dan.
935400	936400	Thank you, Cameron.
937400	940400	But when you go to a hotel, they have nice showers, and you go,
940400	941400	I don't know.
941400	942400	As long as I'm here.
942400	943400	Yeah.
943400	947800	I was alone for a couple weeks in Baltimore, completely alone in a hotel room, and I was
947800	950640	showering five, six times a day just to pass the time.
950640	951640	Oh, yeah.
951640	952640	No, I remember.
952640	954160	Did you talk about that in Harman Town?
954160	955160	Maybe.
955160	957280	Maybe I was tweeting about it, because I had nothing to do except shower.
957280	959160	You're like one of those guys that would tease me.
959160	960160	What?
960160	961160	No.
961160	963160	Oh, yeah, because you would then go, oh, I took a shower five times a day.
963600	966600	And you'd be like, yeah, this is a new thing I can brag about.
966600	967600	I was like, I don't.
967600	968600	Do you want it to do that?
968600	970600	Why can't everyone just do what they want to do?
970600	972600	I didn't say anything to you, Dan.
972600	973600	No, I know.
973600	977720	But I was agreeing with you that when I'm moving and lonely, I shower more.
977720	978720	But if I'm surrounded...
978720	979720	Because you can't wait to get in there.
979720	980720	That's crazy to me.
980720	982840	You have to take off all your clothes.
982840	985840	Well, you have to do that with a bath, too.
985840	986840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
986840	987840	No, no, no.
987840	988840	And I don't take a lot of those.
989160	993160	It's like you have to take all of your clothes off.
993160	995160	You have a problem with nudity?
995160	997160	It's just the energy expenditure.
997160	999160	It's just everything.
999160	1001160	And then you're going to have to put it back on later.
1001160	1005160	It's the putting back on that I feel like a hero every time I put pants on.
1005160	1008160	I'm like, fuck, I'm so good at this.
1008160	1009160	I hate it.
1009160	1012680	Season three of Community, I came to a point where I was like, I got this.
1012680	1015680	I'm going to wear my pajamas to work.
1015680	1016680	And then I got fired.
1017520	1020520	But I was really proud of myself for a while.
1020520	1022520	I was like, I'm working on my pajamas.
1022520	1024520	I'm coming to work on my pajamas.
1024520	1026520	Inspire leadership in my pajamas.
1026520	1028520	Because the editor would see me and go, what are you doing?
1028520	1030520	And I'm going, I'm doing what you can do.
1030520	1034520	It's called fucking culture jamming.
1036520	1038520	Why do you wear pajamas to bed?
1038520	1040520	They're comfortable.
1040520	1041520	Yeah.
1041520	1044520	What, are you going to dream little editor dreams in your little editor bed?
1044520	1046520	In your editor pajamas?
1047480	1049480	That's the version of you I want.
1049480	1051480	Relax, sleepy you.
1051480	1053480	Culture jamming.
1053480	1055480	Culture jamming.
1059480	1063480	If you have a question about culture jamming, it's already been answered.
1063480	1065480	It's not about culture jamming.
1065480	1067480	This is for Dan and Neil and Spencer.
1067480	1069480	And this is kind of a twist on the first question.
1069480	1073480	Something that wasn't included in the movie, but not for content.
1073480	1079480	It just had to be cut for time or didn't fit the tone that you wish could have been in there.
1079480	1083480	Honestly, I feel compelled to tell this story just because I think it's interesting.
1083480	1085480	That because I think there was this moment.
1085480	1094480	There was this big thing in the documentary that Neil kept including where I jokingly called Aaron the C word.
1094480	1096480	It was like 10 minutes into the movie.
1096480	1098480	We had just gotten out of the road.
1098480	1104480	And Neil, I don't want to say you thought it was funny and make you sound like you're some kind of weirdo.
1104480	1108480	But you were like, it's obviously a joke that says a lot about your relationship.
1108480	1111480	Because Aaron thought it was funny and we were like, joke about it.
1111480	1113480	But it didn't translate.
1113480	1116480	The bottom line is things like the C word, for instance.
1116480	1121480	It changes the experience in the movie you're watching.
1121480	1126480	So I was saying to Neil, I want you to understand that I do not want to look like a good person in this movie.
1126480	1132480	But I also want you to understand that that early in the film, that's going to be like this weird...
1132480	1139480	If you went on a roller coaster and then just a pelican dropped into your lap, it changes the roller coaster.
1139480	1143480	Like, is this a Wild West themed roller coaster? Is it a space themed roller coaster? It doesn't matter.
1143480	1145480	Now it's a pelican themed roller coaster.
1145480	1147480	It changes the audience experience.
1147480	1149480	Save that shit for later.
1149480	1151480	Aaron says later, he called me the C word.
1151480	1154480	You hear the audience boo. It's part of the story.
1154480	1157480	Yeah, you can't have two subplots about the C word.
1157480	1163480	One's just a bit. It's like, oh, they're hilarious together. It does not translate. Trust me.
1163480	1171480	It was like, remember in the movie when I go like, to hubris, to go on the perfect tour, tour, tour.
1171480	1173480	And I do like a fake echo on my own.
1173480	1176480	And then Aaron says, why are you doing the echo?
1176480	1179480	They can do the echo later. And I'm like, that's the bit.
1180480	1184480	It's meta. It's like if we did a documentary about how we fight all the time.
1184480	1187480	And then she says, we don't fight all the time. And I'm like, yes, we do.
1187480	1190480	And she's like, no, we don't. And we start fighting.
1190480	1195480	And it's a funny bit. And it culminates in me calling her the C word.
1195480	1200480	And it's hilarious in our lives and not a good thing to happen 10 minutes into the movie.
1200480	1202480	So that's an example.
1202480	1204480	At the time, it was a character thing, but it says a lot of people have asked, like,
1204480	1208480	what was it like to make a movie with a guy who's in the movie he's producing?
1208480	1211480	And that was a note where, damn, there was a moment where at the very end, you said,
1211480	1216480	look, I'll tell you one last time, I've been in rooms where people have said the C word and the N word,
1216480	1220480	the G word, the Q word. Get ready. And we look at it.
1220480	1222480	Is Q word just cunt with a Q?
1222480	1225480	No, it's Q word. People are really sensitive about, oh, yeah.
1225480	1227480	Q, C.
1229480	1231480	Thank you. Thank you.
1231480	1234480	So that's when it came out as I was like, okay, I hear what you're saying.
1234480	1236480	I understand that note.
1236480	1238480	It's not about you being a good person or a bad person.
1238480	1240480	You're talking about losing an audience.
1240480	1242480	Yeah, I had to promise. I'm going to swear to God I'm not.
1242480	1244480	I'm not trying to make myself look cool here.
1244480	1247480	Just please don't keep that part in.
1247480	1250480	I think that answered your question. I don't know.
1250480	1254480	I mean, this doesn't really qualify as an answer to your question,
1254480	1259480	but every time I see it, there's this guy wearing this orange-brown beanie cap,
1259480	1262480	and you see him twice in the whole movie, and they're really close together.
1262480	1265480	And that guy gave me that beanie during one of the shows,
1265480	1271480	and every time I see it, I'm like, that beanie has a story to it that only I know.
1271480	1275480	And no one else is going to know this, but now you guys do, maybe.
1275480	1278480	Wait, was your question about things that were not in the movie?
1278480	1281480	Yeah. What ended up outside the movie?
1281480	1283480	Oh, yes. I will tell you this.
1283480	1285480	All right. I fucked up my answer.
1285480	1288480	No, no. Your answer was totally good, right?
1288480	1294480	But soon, next week, someday, you'll all learn that there's going to be a place.
1294480	1296480	I don't know what I can talk about, but there's going to be a place on the internet
1296480	1301480	where you can go there called harmontown.com and see the making of Chicken Noodle Dick.
1301480	1306480	It's a scene that didn't make it in the movie, but it's pretty amazing,
1306480	1308480	and I can't wait for you all to see it.
1308480	1311480	It is kind of interesting, because we got high, and we're on the bus,
1311480	1313480	and we're just laying there giggling.
1313480	1317480	But it takes forever, because you don't want to jump cut within it.
1317480	1321480	Well, it takes like six, there's a Honey Bear Dick song,
1321480	1325480	and there's an Aspirin Dick. There's several dicks that were sung about
1325480	1328480	until Chicken Noodle became the Huckleberry.
1328480	1332480	Yeah.
1332480	1336480	The Huckleberry of what? What does that mean?
1336480	1338480	Yeah, I didn't get that either. What is Huckleberry?
1338480	1341480	We almost just glided right past it.
1341480	1345480	Are you just trying to start a new phrase? You're trying to slip it in?
1345480	1348480	That's fucking Huckleberry anyway.
1348480	1350480	Neil, that's not a thing anyone says.
1350480	1352480	Hashtag. Spread that.
1352480	1354480	Is that a saying? Huckleberry?
1354480	1357480	I'll be your Huckleberry. It's from Tombstone.
1357480	1358480	Oh, Tombstone.
1358480	1361480	Oh, yeah. That movie that is part of the lexicon.
1366480	1369480	It's like you were referencing Wizard of Oz.
1369480	1372480	Why did people quote that thing? He goes, I'll be your Huckleberry.
1372480	1376480	And everyone's like, yeah, what a badass. What the fuck is he talking about?
1376480	1378480	I never got that.
1378480	1379480	What the fuck are you talking about?
1379480	1381480	I thought everyone would know. I don't know what it means.
1381480	1384480	I'm your Huckleberry. What do you mean you're his Huckleberry?
1384480	1387480	He's Tom Sawyer? Don't shoot him.
1387480	1390480	It must be that. That makes a lot of sense, actually.
1390480	1392480	Was that book contemporary?
1392480	1395480	Well, it was Mark Twain's classic.
1395480	1398480	And Huckleberry was like, I'm the grounded sidekick.
1398480	1400480	I'm your Huckleberry.
1400480	1404480	And he's dying against a tree? How are you my Huckleberry?
1404480	1406480	I didn't see the movie.
1406480	1408480	You should check it out. It's a really good movie.
1408480	1410480	Also, watch Silverado.
1410480	1412480	Also, read Huck Finn.
1412480	1416480	Yeah, sure. If you love the N-word.
1416480	1419480	Also, read Huck Finn.
1419480	1421480	If you love the N-word.
1421480	1426480	If you love the N-word, you'll love the new Toyota Corolla.
1426480	1429480	Sponsor of Hymn in Town.
1429480	1431480	Smooths.
1431480	1435480	Smooths. I don't know what that sentence was. Go ahead.
1435480	1437480	Hi, I'm Adam.
1437480	1441480	I have a question for Dan and then one for Spencer.
1441480	1445480	I'm sorry. After you ask the question, you're going to have to go to the back of the line.
1445480	1447480	Ask Spencer.
1447480	1451480	Dan, what was the feeling like when NBC got a hold of you and were like, hey, we're sorry.
1451480	1453480	Come back.
1453480	1455480	That didn't happen.
1455480	1457480	These things don't happen.
1457480	1463480	If you ever are privileged to be fired from a television show, the way you find out is your agent tells you.
1463480	1465480	And then your agent tells you you've been rehired.
1465480	1467480	That's it.
1467480	1474480	None of the suits actually meet you and say that they are your huckleberry.
1474480	1478480	There's no boombox outside the window.
1478480	1481480	That's from a movie called Say Anything.
1481480	1483480	You know how in firing squads, I don't know if you know this one.
1483480	1487480	They used to shoot people to kill them officially.
1487480	1489480	One person would have a blank.
1489480	1491480	They would put one blank in it.
1491480	1495480	It's a systemic unaccountability.
1495480	1500480	Each person gets to think I'm probably not the one actually killing this person.
1500480	1502480	I'm probably a hero.
1502480	1504480	That's television.
1504480	1507480	Everyone just goes, hey, what am I doing?
1507480	1509480	I don't know. Fuck it.
1509480	1511480	My parents are rich. I'll just do this.
1511480	1519480	And then if you get fired, you find out not by anybody telling you anything that would ever reflect poorly on them.
1519480	1522480	You find out by the phone not ringing.
1522480	1529480	And then when you get rehired, again, it's like, hey, I guess I'm back.
1529480	1531480	Yeah, it's not exciting.
1531480	1535480	So fuck you, kid.
1535480	1537480	Adam, your question for Spencer?
1537480	1540480	Spencer, what's your favorite edition of D&D to play?
1540480	1544480	We play Pathfinder, which isn't officially D&D, as it were.
1544480	1546480	But it counts.
1546480	1552480	The fifth edition of official D&Ds just came out, and I'd recommend it to new players.
1552480	1558480	It's a very joyless sounding answer. I love D&D practice.
1558480	1561480	Thank you.
1561480	1563480	Hi, I'm Mark.
1563480	1569480	This question for Dan, since they didn't get picked up, can we kind of know what those pilots were about in the movie?
1569480	1577480	The CBS pilot, it was sort of an absolutely fabulous kind of ripoff.
1577480	1582480	It was actually my fiancé, Aaron's idea.
1582480	1594480	It was about a guy who had been a rock star in the 90s, who had returned to his hometown and opened a bar.
1594480	1598480	And he was in his 40s, and he was just running this bar.
1598480	1607480	He was the consummate non-sellout and former rock star, who people would come to his bar and be like,
1607480	1611480	man, this fucking guy used to be in this thing, and he's not a sellout. He owns his bar now.
1611480	1618480	And then this 15-year-old girl walks into the pilot. She's his previously unknown daughter.
1618480	1619480	Huckleberry?
1619480	1625480	She's his huckleberry, and she wants to come live with him so she can get into an art school.
1625480	1631480	If she has a residence there in that city, she can go to this art school that she wants to go to.
1631480	1639480	So it's really Ab Fab. It's with a dude, which hopefully would have been Jack Black, but then he didn't want to do it, so it died.
1639480	1641480	But it was pretty cool. I haven't read it.
1641480	1643480	That sounds good. You haven't read it?
1643480	1646480	Well, I haven't read it since I gave it to him. It might suck, but I thought it was pretty good.
1646480	1648480	That does sound awesome. What was the Fox one?
1648480	1650480	I don't know.
1650480	1656480	Actually, the Fox thing was going to be like 30 Rock at a video game studio.
1656480	1658480	Basically, it was going to be...
1658480	1662480	If you wait long enough, everyone that hired you gets fired.
1662480	1667480	The Fox that I worked for doesn't exist anymore. It's all different people now.
1667480	1669480	It doesn't matter. It's not like there's some guy going,
1669480	1674480	I'm Mr. Fox, and you'll regret this decision.
1674480	1679480	You just signed a deal with some guy named Kevin Johnson, and then Kevin Johnson's like,
1679480	1689480	now I'm at CBS. Oh shit. It doesn't matter. It's fine.
1689480	1698480	Hey, I just want to point out that I thought it was pretty funny, you guys jumping onto a film reference that was like,
1698480	1703480	oh, we're all nerds here, but that scene with Val Kilmer, no one was going to reference that. No one's going to get that.
1704480	1708480	It was kind of funny. I'm joking.
1708480	1712480	Because we jumped on him, I was jumping on you to make a joke, and then it just came across as me.
1712480	1714480	It's okay. You blocked me on Twitter. It's fine. I get it.
1714480	1718480	I did block you? Oh, okay. You probably deserved it.
1718480	1719480	Yeah, I did.
1719480	1720480	What did you do?
1720480	1723480	I think I was really happy that Emily followed me, and I was like,
1723480	1729480	oh, your Twitter follow that's soon going to follow going to be a hack or something,
1729480	1731480	and then after that I was blocked.
1731480	1734480	Oh, no, it must have been a mistake. That doesn't sound like a block of law.
1734480	1736480	Maybe it was something else that I surely...
1736480	1737480	The fuck is going on?
1737480	1738480	See, he's asking for it.
1738480	1740480	I don't know. Anyway, go ahead.
1740480	1744480	Yeah, okay. Sorry about that. My questions are for Spencer, actually.
1744480	1745480	Yes.
1745480	1747480	Two-parter.
1747480	1749480	Oh, no.
1749480	1756480	Number one, I'm kind of new to the world of D&D. I just got into it for professional reasons.
1756480	1758480	Wait. Wow.
1758480	1760480	Are you trying to get a job in Hollywood?
1760480	1761480	No.
1761480	1762480	Yeah.
1762480	1766480	I really want to be the second host, like the other guy on the couch.
1766480	1767480	I got you.
1767480	1768480	I don't have a couch.
1768480	1769480	Okay.
1769480	1770480	I don't even own a couch.
1770480	1773480	Somebody get this guy a couch.
1773480	1775480	Trevor? Xanthon?
1775480	1778480	Ah, fan Xanthon.
1778480	1781480	He can haul a couch.
1781480	1786480	It's just for game design, but I noticed a lot of other game designers
1786480	1790480	have this really personal, deep relationship
1790480	1792480	where they really cherish their D&D memories,
1792480	1794480	just role-playing game memories in general,
1794480	1799480	and a lot of them saw it as not just their first introduction
1799480	1801480	to rules and systems for a game,
1801480	1805480	but also for building a community and having social interaction
1805480	1806480	that you're kind of...
1806480	1807480	You don't want to be lame and be like,
1807480	1809480	oh, man, I'd miss my friends if I don't see them every week,
1809480	1810480	but you put that all into like,
1810480	1812480	hey, we've got to play this game every week, right?
1812480	1815480	We have this social contract to hang out with each other
1815480	1818480	and work our shit out because we have to play this game every week.
1818480	1821480	I was wondering if that was your experience with D&D?
1821480	1824480	Like having really fond memories of building communities.
1824480	1827480	Yeah, and playing with friends, making it very social.
1827480	1829480	I mean, that's all...
1829480	1833480	In my opinion, that's the worst part of Dungeons & Dragons
1833480	1839480	is that it really brings out the darkness in interpersonal relationships
1839480	1841480	and they always come to the surface.
1841480	1844480	Like, if it turns out you really hate your friend's haircut,
1844480	1848480	like in Dungeons & Dragons, you're going to get in a fistfight over that.
1848480	1852480	And the rules have been my refuge
1852480	1856480	from thinking about all the social problems that I've experienced.
1856480	1859480	It's been kind of nightmarish.
1859480	1862480	I've lost like three groups of friends probably
1862480	1865480	that just hate each other because of Dungeons & Dragons games.
1865480	1868480	So, I mean, I wish I could...
1868480	1870480	Yeah, but it's...
1870480	1872480	It breaks up families.
1872480	1875480	I already have the answer to part two of my question.
1875480	1880480	I was like, would you think about doing a game at PAX or something like that?
1880480	1882480	I think that might draw a crowd.
1882480	1886480	I'll do whatever anyone will pay for.
1886480	1888480	Not pay me for, but get me out there.
1888480	1890480	It's like Alex P Keaton over here.
1890480	1893480	I don't got much going on.
1893480	1897480	I don't do it for the love of the game, man.
1897480	1899480	Love of the game, man.
1899480	1900480	Thank you.
1900480	1901480	Thanks, man.
1903480	1906480	That was a great two-part question, by the way.
1906480	1909480	I shit all over the second part.
1909480	1911480	You know, two-part questions are bullshit.
1911480	1912480	Yeah.
1912480	1913480	Everybody knows that.
1913480	1914480	They're basically cheating.
1914480	1915480	Yes.
1915480	1916480	I have a...
1916480	1918480	Hello, I'm Oliver Twist.
1918480	1922480	I have a two-part bowl that I like filled with soup.
1922480	1925480	Obviously, that's not allowed.
1925480	1926480	It's not allowed.
1926480	1929480	You're describing a tray.
1929480	1930480	Yeah.
1930480	1932480	So what's your Twitter handle?
1932480	1937480	Do you have to look it up?
1937480	1940480	It's double question at 69.Twitter.
1940480	1942480	I don't know how Twitter handles it.
1942480	1943480	I'm not sure.
1943480	1944480	I'm not sure.
1944480	1945480	I'm not sure.
1945480	1946480	I'm not sure.
1946480	1947480	I'm not sure.
1947480	1948480	I'm not sure.
1948480	1949480	I'm not sure.
1949480	1950480	I'm not sure.
1951480	1953480	I don't know how Twitter works.
1953480	1954480	All right.
1954480	1956480	Benny and June, let's go.
1956480	1959480	So first off, I love the movie.
1959480	1960480	First off, I love the movie.
1960480	1962480	It started selling a broken record.
1962480	1964480	But I was wondering, since Yahoo's been our savior,
1964480	1966480	it's bringing back community, if you're looking forward to
1966480	1968480	rubbing it in NBC's face.
1968480	1972480	Well, NBC still owns the show.
1972480	1975480	So it's as successful as the show is,
1975480	1977480	then they'll be like, thank you.
1977480	1978480	I don't know.
1978480	1979480	There's no way out of it.
1979480	1981480	But if you're making a show for,
1981480	1984480	the only way to get revenge on all the suits in the world
1984480	1988480	is to make something in your sandbox that they don't own,
1988480	1990480	and then no one gets to see it.
1990480	1993480	Or you can be really brave and 23, which you are,
1993480	1996480	and you could, like, don't work with Sony and NBC and all that stuff.
1996480	1998480	But if you are, if you have gone down that road
1998480	2001480	and you've created a show, like Community,
2001480	2004480	that has NBC's money in it, Sony's money in it,
2004480	2006480	and now Yahoo's money in it, you know,
2006480	2009480	you can't really get revenge on anybody.
2009480	2011480	You're in it with the fans,
2011480	2013480	and the money's coming from everywhere, and you can't...
2013480	2015480	It's weird, because I guess if it succeeds,
2015480	2019480	they get money, and if it loses, well, they were right for canceling it.
2019480	2021480	NBC's in like a...
2021480	2022480	Yeah.
2022480	2024480	And in either case, they're not going to care.
2024480	2029480	You know, NBC's going to be a food channel by then,
2029480	2031480	or the most important network in the world.
2031480	2032480	I mean, we don't know.
2032480	2033480	Everything changes every year.
2033480	2037480	I caught myself, like, quoted on TMZ as saying something.
2037480	2041480	Yeah, NBC will be a food network in a year.
2041480	2042480	It's like...
2042480	2044480	Dan Harmon slams food network.
2044480	2049480	Their job isn't to care,
2049480	2051480	and our job isn't to get revenge on them,
2051480	2052480	because there is no them.
2052480	2055480	That's the problem with them, is that they're not them.
2055480	2056480	We are them.
2056480	2057480	They aren't them.
2057480	2059480	They are corporations.
2059480	2061480	The them is inside of us.
2062480	2066480	If you compete with them, then you're going to fuck the them that you are.
2066480	2071480	Like, the only them that is is Vince Gilligan and people who make shows.
2071480	2074480	Like, the people who make the costumes and the props,
2074480	2077480	and they actually roll the cameras and stuff, those are the them.
2077480	2079480	And Los Angeles is filled with them,
2079480	2082480	and then there's the them that's like, what?
2082480	2083480	The logo?
2083480	2087480	Natgeo.org, or whatever you end up airing on.
2087480	2090480	Those people, if they're the good guys or the bad guys,
2090480	2095480	you're equally psychotic, because you have to just make a product, so...
2095480	2100480	I was wondering when we can expect the Spencer Brand D20s to be in store.
2100480	2101480	Oh, man.
2101480	2102480	You're like Peter North.
2102480	2105480	You're like Peter North of...
2105480	2109480	The negotiations with Chessex Dice have really gone south.
2109480	2115480	I'm going to have to get my own injection mold, and it's a real to-do.
2115480	2118480	Thank you.
2118480	2119480	Thank you.
2119480	2120480	Hi, I'm Evan.
2120480	2121480	I love to meet you all.
2121480	2122480	Hey, Evan.
2122480	2123480	Nice to meet you.
2123480	2126480	My question is, between writing the pilot scripts
2126480	2131480	and making songs about Pringles' dicks, what kinds of things did you do
2131480	2133480	between tours this past the time?
2133480	2134480	That's it.
2134480	2136480	I mean, the Pringles' dick song and the...
2136480	2137480	What's the...
2137480	2138480	Sleeping.
2138480	2139480	Slept.
2139480	2140480	Past the time, yeah.
2140480	2141480	You play video games?
2141480	2143480	Now, just Minecraft.
2143480	2144480	That's it.
2144480	2147480	But that deserves to be talked about on a level of heroin.
2147480	2150480	I have a problem right now.
2150480	2153480	Season 6 of Community is going to be worse because of Minecraft.
2153480	2155480	This is going to be a Minecraft episode?
2155480	2156480	That's your addition?
2156480	2159480	I keep saying to the writers, we should do a Minecraft episode,
2159480	2163480	but it's like a junkie saying, we should do a heroin episode.
2163480	2166480	And they're like, yeah, I bet we should.
2166480	2169480	That would make you real happy, wouldn't it, boss?
2169480	2172480	Make that needle dangling out of your arm like a prop
2172480	2175480	instead of a fucking thing that we need to deal with.
2175480	2177480	Clean up your act.
2177480	2180480	And I guess it's like, this kind of involves Spencer,
2180480	2183480	but what inspired you to have him in the VCR episode?
2183480	2186480	Is everyone asking many questions?
2188480	2189480	What are the rules?
2189480	2190480	I don't know, man.
2190480	2191480	What are the rules?
2191480	2193480	Is this a Q&A or a podcast?
2193480	2194480	I don't know.
2194480	2197480	I mean, we know, it's obviously we're into Harman Town.
2197480	2199480	Yeah, we're into Harman Town.
2199480	2200480	It's the worst Harman Town ever.
2201480	2203480	And the best Q&A ever.
2203480	2204480	That's right.
2204480	2206480	This is the Venn diagram.
2206480	2207480	Overlap.
2207480	2208480	I don't know what words mean.
2208480	2209480	Go ahead.
2209480	2210480	What happens?
2210480	2212480	Was there a question in the audience?
2212480	2216480	Yeah, what inspired having Spencer on the VCR episode?
2216480	2217480	Oh, that's not to me.
2217480	2218480	That's you.
2218480	2219480	That's kind of both of you.
2219480	2220480	I didn't inspire it.
2220480	2221480	I don't know.
2221480	2225480	I kind of feel like he looks like he could be Alice and Bree's brother.
2225480	2227480	I don't know.
2227480	2232480	Yeah, he's a beautiful Viking with these piercing eyes.
2232480	2234480	He does have a very handsome face.
2234480	2235480	You do.
2235480	2236480	I honestly can't remember.
2236480	2238480	I don't know.
2238480	2239480	No, I know what it was.
2239480	2241480	I guess I can't answer this question.
2241480	2245480	There was a character who, well, it's fine to say plots are never going to happen.
2245480	2246480	Yeah, yeah.
2246480	2247480	Well, okay.
2247480	2248480	We were pitching a story about Britta.
2248480	2251480	About Britta hooking up with Annie's brother.
2251480	2255480	And that plot line kind of fell away and transmuted into this driven plot line.
2255480	2261480	Annie's brother was going to be like a photojournalist who was like a Mark Ruffalo type, who Britta
2261480	2264480	immediately pounced on and was going to cause strife between them.
2264480	2266480	It's like the boy next door kind of thing.
2266480	2267480	It felt a little uninspired.
2267480	2271480	And then I was like, what is Annie's brother not supposed to be?
2271480	2273480	The characterization of that kind of fell away.
2273480	2275480	And then there was like, oh, I guess anyone can do it.
2275480	2278480	And then someone put like Viking type in the script.
2278480	2280480	And then everyone thought it was me.
2280480	2282480	And then I got cast.
2282480	2285480	But the writers were quite taken with him because I had this guy coming in.
2285480	2290480	And then he'd go like, Dan, what size are your pants?
2290480	2293480	And so the writers were like, who is that?
2293480	2295480	That's my dungeon master.
2295480	2296480	Yeah.
2296480	2301480	You also have a documentary that desperately needed an ending.
2301480	2303480	That's true as well.
2303480	2304480	Yes.
2304480	2306480	Wait, can I do the honorable thing?
2306480	2309480	And that just is not going to go well.
2309480	2311480	Is there a movie question for me in the line?
2311480	2312480	OK.
2312480	2313480	Can you give Evan?
2313480	2314480	Thank you.
2314480	2315480	Yes.
2315480	2316480	I will eject.
2316480	2317480	That's not honorable.
2317480	2318480	That's high maintenance.
2318480	2321480	That sounds like the worst thing to say during sex.
2321480	2323480	Just eject.
2323480	2324480	All right, here it is.
2324480	2325480	Sorry.
2325480	2327480	I saw you guys on the Massachusetts tour stop.
2327480	2330480	So it's really cool to see it all finished.
2330480	2333480	Did you know what the emotional premise or main storyline of the movie would be
2333480	2335480	before during shooting?
2335480	2338480	Or did you figure out the true focus during the editing process?
2338480	2340480	The latter, yes.
2341480	2342480	We went out.
2342480	2344480	I met Dan on Thanksgiving in 2012.
2344480	2348480	I shot My First Harmontown on December 3rd.
2348480	2350480	And we hit the road on January 9th.
2350480	2353480	I had never listened to a podcast until he emailed me.
2353480	2356480	I hadn't talked to him very much.
2356480	2359480	I had no idea what this movie would be about.
2359480	2360480	Totally honest.
2360480	2361480	He had an idea.
2361480	2363480	I had an idea of what I think it should be.
2363480	2367480	We went out and we just chased Story the whole time we were out there.
2367480	2368480	We looked for things.
2368480	2371480	And halfway through, we had an idea of what it might be about.
2371480	2373480	But there was a long editorial process.
2373480	2376480	We went through a lot of different stages, ups and downs,
2376480	2380480	and good stories, bad stories, good movies, and bad movies.
2380480	2382480	And we came out.
2382480	2385480	And Aaron McGathey actually, about midway, said,
2385480	2387480	just make this movie about Spencer.
2387480	2390480	And there is a cut that exists that is all about Spencer.
2390480	2392480	Don't clap for that.
2392480	2394480	You'll never see it.
2394480	2397480	Spencer's mom is here too, I guess.
2398480	2399480	But it triggered a lot.
2399480	2402480	A lot of light bulbs went off when we made that cut.
2402480	2405480	And it turned into the cut you saw today.
2405480	2407480	But no, it took a lot of editorial.
2407480	2409480	And if I may, there are two guys.
2409480	2410480	Can I do a quick question?
2410480	2411480	Sure, sure.
2411480	2412480	Do you mind?
2412480	2413480	I'm sorry.
2413480	2415480	There are two guys in the audience that I failed to thank.
2415480	2416480	And thank God this is being podcast.
2416480	2418480	But James Lesh is here tonight.
2418480	2422480	He's an editor on this movie who is with me the whole process.
2422480	2426480	And Academy Award-winning Kevin Clobber,
2426480	2429480	who cut Crossfire Hurricane, The Pearl Jam Doc,
2429480	2430480	Beauty's Embarrassing, this movie,
2430480	2432480	and the assumed-to-be Kurt Cobain Doc.
2432480	2433480	He's a genius.
2433480	2436480	And he's the reason this movie exists.
2436480	2437480	So thank those guys.
2437480	2441480	Thank you.
2441480	2443480	Thank you.
2443480	2445480	This is a question for Spencer,
2445480	2447480	but Whittiest Side's welcome by you three.
2447480	2449480	Should you have them?
2449480	2454480	I'm wondering any chance of a Spencer podcast?
2454480	2456480	Do you have any ideas?
2456480	2459480	I maybe call it The Kriten Den.
2459480	2460480	I don't know.
2460480	2462480	The Kriten Den.
2462480	2464480	That's a pretty catchy topic.
2464480	2466480	I think you just kind of had an idea.
2466480	2467480	I meant concept.
2467480	2468480	I mean, that's a great title.
2468480	2470480	But I don't know what I do.
2470480	2472480	Like, I just sit and fart.
2472480	2473480	Ask him.
2473480	2474480	What would he do in The Kriten Den?
2474480	2476480	That is what I ask him.
2476480	2477480	I haven't gotten that far.
2477480	2478480	I'm sorry.
2478480	2479480	All right.
2479480	2480480	Well, you and me, let's talk.
2480480	2481480	We can make it happen.
2481480	2482480	Thank you.
2482480	2483480	That was a good idea.
2483480	2484480	Let me know.
2484480	2486480	I'll do whatever anyone wants me to do.
2486480	2489480	It's part of his charm, I guess.
2489480	2492480	I don't know what charm is.
2492480	2496480	Someone's been murdered, and we're about to find out.
2496480	2498480	This question is for Spencer.
2498480	2500480	I am cleaning up today.
2500480	2501480	Yes.
2501480	2502480	Q&A should be called.
2502480	2504480	This question is for Spencer.
2504480	2505480	I'm into it.
2505480	2509480	That will be the name of the documentary of tonight.
2509480	2511480	I'm also a dungeon master.
2511480	2515480	I have a hard time getting enough material for one day.
2515480	2519480	How are you able to make material for 20 straight days?
2519480	2523480	Well, the trick is you only play for five minutes.
2523480	2526480	With a bunch of people who keep going, what am I doing?
2526480	2527480	Yeah.
2527480	2528480	No.
2528480	2533480	I mean, honestly, I've learned to prepare less each week,
2533480	2537480	because if I was to say, let's plan out five hours,
2537480	2540480	in the first hour, they're going to go into a house.
2540480	2543480	You know the first thing they're going to do is like shit on the house
2543480	2548480	or turn it into the warp zone or nothing that makes any sense.
2548480	2551480	So you just plan one seed worth,
2551480	2554480	and then you have ideas of where you could go after that.
2554480	2555480	But that's what I do.
2555480	2558480	It's different than preparing for your typical four-hour session
2558480	2559480	or whatever.
2559480	2560480	Right.
2560480	2561480	Thank you.
2561480	2564480	Thank you.
2564480	2565480	I am Jeff.
2565480	2568480	I want to know if there's going to be a Harman Town tour too.
2568480	2569480	Part two.
2569480	2570480	Part two.
2570480	2571480	I don't know.
2571480	2573480	We'll be making that decision these days, I guess.
2573480	2575480	I mean, this is certainly exhilarating.
2575480	2577480	I'm sure there's a lot of people in the audience right now
2577480	2580480	that want to kill themselves, but I'm having a great time.
2580480	2583480	And the seats are full, and the movie is well-received,
2583480	2586480	so it might make an obvious choice to like go.
2586480	2589480	I always thought, we'll call the first one Harman Town.
2589480	2591480	But you're looking at me like I'm going to be involved.
2591480	2593480	Like I'm on board.
2593480	2594480	What am I going to do?
2594480	2595480	No, no.
2595480	2597480	Because you're like, I'll be doing a documentary.
2597480	2599480	No, I didn't know you would actually look at me saying,
2599480	2600480	how are we doing?
2600480	2602480	Yeah, there should be.
2602480	2603480	There should be several.
2603480	2605480	This is a special thing.
2605480	2606480	I like this thing.
2606480	2607480	I like what's going on.
2607480	2608480	We'll do Harman World.
2608480	2609480	Harman World.
2609480	2612480	We'll go to Edinburgh and tell the things that people are always
2612480	2613480	tweeting at us.
2613480	2616480	How come you never come to such a place worldwide?
2616480	2617480	Whatever.
2617480	2618480	I mean, I don't know.
2618480	2619480	Yes.
2619480	2620480	Harman World.
2620480	2621480	I have another question.
2621480	2622480	I'm sorry.
2622480	2623480	I mean, it's fine.
2623480	2624480	Go ahead.
2624480	2625480	It's the precedent.
2626480	2627480	All this is edited out.
2627480	2628480	This is all just a Q&A.
2628480	2630480	It's like in a fucking archive.
2630480	2631480	That's it.
2631480	2633480	Who is Spencer Crittenden?
2633480	2634480	Oh, shit.
2636480	2638480	Who's that question to?
2638480	2639480	All of you.
2639480	2640480	Oh, shit.
2641480	2643480	I think he's Hitler.
2644480	2648480	Yeah, this is like, this is a long con.
2648480	2651480	If you ask me, I get to answer how I want to answer.
2651480	2653480	I think he's Hitler.
2654480	2655480	Bearded Hitler.
2656480	2658480	I think this is how Hitler started.
2658480	2660480	Several good points being raised.
2662480	2666480	I think Hitler was at a Nazi show.
2666480	2668480	He was like, I could be dungeon master.
2668480	2669480	Yeah.
2669480	2671480	And he's like, master, master, race.
2671480	2674480	I'd like to have fun with you and the thing.
2674480	2675480	Yeah.
2675480	2676480	I don't know.
2676480	2678480	That is a spot on Hitler, by the way.
2678480	2679480	Thank you.
2679480	2682480	Here's Hitler as your plumber.
2682480	2686480	It seems like you'll have his toilet.
2690480	2691480	All right.
2691480	2692480	Thank you.
2692480	2694480	I'm the last person who knows who I am.
2694480	2695480	Who are you?
2695480	2697480	I'm the last person.
2697480	2698480	Just say it.
2699480	2700480	What does that even mean, man?
2700480	2701480	Well, say it.
2701480	2702480	You know you're thinking like...
2702480	2704480	Ewan McGregor.
2704480	2706480	Who's Ewan McGregor?
2706480	2707480	Who's Ewan McGregor?
2707480	2708480	Who's Ewan McGregor?
2708480	2710480	Are you fucking fucking me right now?
2710480	2713480	Is that like Ewan McGregor?
2713480	2714480	It's...
2714480	2715480	What?
2715480	2716480	What?
2716480	2717480	Ewan?
2717480	2720480	You've seen his name in print and you think his name is Ewan McGregor?
2720480	2722480	Well, they're brothers, right?
2722480	2723480	No.
2723480	2726480	It's Ewan McGregor and he's one person.
2726480	2729480	I thought it was Ewan and Ewing, like Patrick Ewing.
2729480	2730480	Ewing McGregor.
2730480	2731480	He's not.
2731480	2732480	He's doing a bit.
2732480	2733480	What?
2733480	2734480	Who's Ewan McGregor?
2734480	2735480	Who's Ewan McGregor?
2735480	2736480	Yeah.
2736480	2737480	He's an actor.
2737480	2738480	Oh, well, fuck.
2738480	2739480	Who cares?
2739480	2740480	A lot of people lie?
2740480	2743480	A lot of people lie.
2743480	2746480	You really don't know who Ewan McGregor is.
2746480	2748480	I don't care who actors are.
2748480	2751480	What's important is the person that they're pretending to be, right?
2751480	2752480	Not who they are.
2752480	2754480	Okay, so you like Obi-Wan.
2754480	2755480	Obi-Wan Kenobi.
2755480	2756480	Who?
2756480	2757480	The real person, Obi-Wan.
2757480	2758480	Oh, Obi-Wan.
2758480	2759480	It's from Star Wars.
2759480	2760480	Obi-Wan.
2760480	2761480	Obi-Wan, yeah.
2761480	2764480	I read the novelizations.
2764480	2766480	I read the novelizations.
2766480	2768480	See, is all the pronunciations wrong?
2768480	2769480	That's a great bet.
2769480	2770480	R2-D2.
2770480	2773480	That would be R2.
2773480	2777480	That is, that would be so funny.
2777480	2780480	You didn't know how to pronounce R2-D2.
2780480	2781480	It's a sketch.
2781480	2787480	It's someone's recounting Star Wars and they've only read the books.
2787480	2789480	I went to school with a guy, sorry.
2789480	2791480	I went to school with a guy named R2-D2.
2791480	2792480	C3 Poe.
2792480	2794480	R2-D2 Gonzales.
2795480	2798480	His parents named it after their favorite character from the Star Wars movie.
2798480	2799480	Shut up.
2799480	2800480	Hey, Gonzales.
2800480	2801480	R2-D2.
2801480	2803480	You didn't have a friend named R2-D2.
2803480	2804480	I didn't have a friend.
2804480	2806480	He went to my school.
2806480	2808480	His name was R2-D2 for real.
2808480	2810480	R2-D2 Gonzales, yeah.
2810480	2811480	For real.
2811480	2814480	Yeah, spelled A-R-T-O-O.
2814480	2816480	A-R-T-O-R-R.
2816480	2818480	I don't know how to spell the D2 part of it.
2818480	2820480	I'm not going to lie.
2820480	2822480	I'll just go with R2.
2822480	2823480	Gonzales.
2824480	2827480	I'm so excited right now.
2827480	2828480	Oh, no.
2828480	2829480	That's R2-Roe.
2829480	2831480	Is it R2-Roe Gonzales?
2831480	2833480	Well, obviously that's going to have a better Google ranking.
2833480	2836480	I mean, that's how the search engine works.
2836480	2837480	R2-D2.
2837480	2844480	What if you type in R2-D2 and what comes up to Autofill is Dan Harmon, Chevy Chase, fired NBC.
2847480	2848480	All right.
2848480	2850480	There is an R2-D2.
2850480	2852480	Okay, there is a person named R2-D2.
2852480	2854480	Yeah, that's all I'm saying.
2854480	2858480	It's not that big of a, you know, coincidence.
2858480	2860480	His last name is Valtter.
2860480	2861480	It's a cultural phenomenon.
2861480	2862480	All right, so this happens.
2862480	2863480	It really is.
2863480	2864480	This is adorable.
2864480	2867480	Young, sexy John Hodgeman.
2869480	2871480	So this question is for the three of you.
2871480	2876480	Was there ever a point in time during the tour where personalities clashed or something happened
2876480	2879480	where you just wanted to turn it around and stop the thing?
2879480	2880480	No, no.
2881480	2884480	The weirdest thing was we left thinking we're going to get tired.
2884480	2885480	We're going to get bored.
2885480	2889480	We're going to get over this so soon, but none of that happened.
2889480	2893480	Being on the tour bus for 20 days is really, really fun.
2893480	2894480	You have a good time.
2894480	2895480	You have the best sleep of your life.
2895480	2896480	You laugh the whole time.
2896480	2897480	It's amazing.
2897480	2898480	Yeah, it was fine.
2898480	2901480	If Erin were here, I think she would want it on record.
2901480	2906480	It's like, no, it's fucking miserable for a relationship to get on that.
2906480	2910480	You could go into that situation with the person you love with your life partner.
2910480	2914480	That is not fair to the relationship.
2914480	2920480	Every individual can get to choose whether to have a good time on that bus, but our relationship
2920480	2924480	was definitely just...
2924480	2925480	It was fine.
2925480	2930480	We survived it, and we knew going in it would be stressful, but it was like...
2930480	2937480	There's cameras everywhere, and Erin loves documentaries and is really smart, and is
2937480	2944480	the reason I contacted Neil because Erin was the one watching Wayne White in Beauty is
2944480	2945480	Embarrassing.
2945480	2950480	Erin is the one who's going like, I want to support you in your documentary.
2950480	2951480	I don't want to look bad.
2951480	2953480	I don't want to do other things.
2953480	2958480	She's going into it thinking all this stuff, and I'm like, don't worry about it.
2958480	2960480	Let's just have fun.
2960480	2961480	It was a nightmare.
2961480	2967480	It was like you can see the things that reality shows do to crazy people that they cast because
2967480	2971480	they're crazy, and then they put them on TV, and they go like, oh, there's cameras everywhere,
2971480	2974480	but just act natural, and they like to watch them unwind.
2974480	2979480	If you're in a relationship and you go get on a tour bus with cameras everywhere, I think
2979480	2983480	it'll find the nooks and crannies of your relationship.
2983480	2986480	Yeah, you're going to get a C-word sub-block in there somewhere.
2987480	2992480	And it was my fault because, yeah, I brought work on the bus and all that stuff, but it
2992480	2996480	was actually a guy because I think like, oh, man, that was fun, but Erin's like, it was
2996480	3001480	a nightmare, and she's right when I look back on it, it was a nightmare for her.
3001480	3002480	Thank you.
3002480	3004480	Thank you.
3004480	3005480	Hello.
3005480	3006480	I enjoyed your documentary very much.
3006480	3010480	I just wanted to ask, during the course of it, I noticed a pervasive use of alcohol,
3010480	3014480	and I wanted to know how real was that or were there any—
3014480	3015480	Have you seen—
3015480	3016480	That was water.
3016480	3017480	It was all fake.
3017480	3018480	Yeah, it was water.
3018480	3020480	Were there any interventions at any point or—
3020480	3024480	Have you seen the comically huge bottle that Dan brought on stage?
3024480	3031480	No, yeah, I drink a lot, and if anyone asks if I'm an alcoholic, I just say yes, because
3031480	3033480	that makes the conversation stop.
3033480	3035480	Thank you for your question.
3035480	3039480	If you say no, then they get to keep talking.
3039480	3041480	I also do the same with racism.
3041480	3043480	And what happened with the moonshine?
3043480	3044480	What happened with the moonshine?
3044480	3045480	Oh my God, he's going to kill us.
3045480	3046480	No, he's sitting right here.
3046480	3047480	Where are you going?
3047480	3048480	Oh, he's sitting here.
3048480	3049480	Oh, God.
3049480	3051480	Because you were like, what happened with the moonshine?
3051480	3052480	You strutted.
3052480	3056480	I think you saw what happened with the moonshine.
3056480	3058480	Yeah, the moonshine was a blackout drunk.
3058480	3059480	I mean, you can hear that podcast.
3059480	3061480	I did do a lot of edits to that podcast.
3061480	3066480	There's actually stuff in the movie that I edited out of the podcast, but you can, by
3066480	3067480	and large, hear that episode.
3067480	3068480	It's Nashville.
3068480	3070480	You can go back and look for it.
3070480	3071480	That's what happened.
3071480	3072480	Yeah, what you saw was what happened.
3072480	3073480	It's pretty crazy.
3073480	3076480	At one point, I took the audience on a bear hunt.
3076480	3078480	Oh, that got cut out completely.
3078480	3079480	That was in several edits.
3079480	3081480	Because I regressed to eat the suit.
3081480	3082480	Oh, man.
3082480	3083480	I didn't like that bear hunt.
3083480	3084480	There was...
3084480	3085480	I don't like bears.
3085480	3089480	It was a full-on blackout crazy warning sign.
3089480	3090480	Thank you.
3090480	3091480	You're welcome.
3091480	3092480	You're welcome.
3092480	3094480	I mean, it's weird that...
3094480	3095480	Okay.
3095480	3096480	How's it going?
3096480	3101480	I mean, you know when you say goodbye to a friend, and then you go to...
3101480	3103480	You keep walking to the parking lot.
3103480	3105480	Yeah, you go to the car.
3105480	3106480	Same corner.
3106480	3107480	I hate that.
3107480	3109480	Like, I'd rather die than be alone.
3109480	3110480	Hey, seek.
3110480	3111480	It's seek.
3111480	3114480	Seek from the podcast.
3114480	3120480	Multiple aneurysm survivors seek.
3120480	3122480	First of all, Neil, you made an amazing movie.
3122480	3125480	This is my second time seeing it, and I still got emotional and cried.
3125480	3130480	And I think you guys represent not only being honest through the whole movie, but represent
3130480	3133480	us really well, and I thank you guys for that.
3133480	3134480	Thank you, seek.
3134480	3135480	Thank you very much.
3135480	3136480	This is very nice of you to say.
3136480	3137480	Thank you.
3137480	3140480	I want to know now that the movie's over, and some time has passed, and they would say,
3140480	3142480	you know, hindsight is 20-20.
3142480	3146480	Like, is there anything from the movie, like, watching it now multiple times with audiences
3146480	3149480	that you're learning or seeing differently?
3149480	3154480	Like, Spencer, do you still get depressed even when good things and bad things happen?
3154480	3156480	Yeah, I'm depressed right now, actually.
3156480	3157480	It's...
3157480	3159480	Yeah, I'm going to be fine, you guys.
3160480	3164480	Also, hire a merch intern, like, fucking make someone else deal with that shit.
3164480	3168480	I told Aaron over and over again, don't do merch, don't do merch.
3168480	3170480	That was not a lesson you learned.
3170480	3173480	That was a lesson everyone else but you learned.
3177480	3178480	Or also, don't do merch.
3178480	3181480	It's not like that's how Adam Sandler makes his money.
3181480	3183480	He makes billion-dollar movies every once in a while.
3183480	3185480	He doesn't give a shit about t-shirts.
3186480	3188480	Somebody sells a t-shirt with Adam Sandler's face.
3188480	3190480	It's like, bootlegged.
3190480	3193480	If I can speak for the fans, if I was in another town and you guys came,
3193480	3195480	that's cool that you guys had merch.
3195480	3197480	Yeah, hire an intern.
3197480	3198480	Alright, high-roaded.
3200480	3206480	Wait, there were 7,000 t-shirts, the amount of merch was unbelievable.
3206480	3210480	Like, there's one shot of it in the beginning where there's lines of garbage bags.
3210480	3211480	Those are filled with t-shirts.
3211480	3212480	And we sold all of it.
3212480	3213480	No, we did not.
3213480	3214480	I know.
3215480	3216480	It's still like half of it.
3216480	3219480	Get your Harman Down t-shirt, HarmanDown.com.
3219480	3222480	I want everyone listening to me to understand something about t-shirts.
3222480	3224480	They're very easy to print.
3224480	3225480	They're very easy to sell.
3225480	3227480	Everyone can always use them.
3227480	3232480	They're a fantastic way to make, to communicate, to express yourself,
3232480	3234480	to exchange in commerce.
3234480	3239480	The amount of money you make on t-shirts will always just give you enough money
3239480	3241480	to make more t-shirts.
3241480	3245480	There is nothing, there isn't anyone out there right now who's like,
3245480	3247480	and then I got the t-shirt business.
3247480	3250480	There's no Howard Hughes of t-shirtery.
3250480	3253480	Well, other than our friend Ryan Ridley who lived off of a t-shirt for two years.
3253480	3256480	That was a different era, yes, Ryan Ridley.
3256480	3258480	Yes, there was a company that, yeah.
3258480	3263480	And if I could just say last, like, Dan, hopefully you don't still see yourself as the villain
3263480	3267480	because I know a lot of us here, you're a hero to us, so thank you guys for the opportunity.
3267480	3268480	Oh, you son of a bitch.
3269480	3271480	You son of a bitch, Zeke.
3272480	3274480	You can't argue with him.
3274480	3278480	If you listen to the podcast, Zeke keeps reporting in.
3278480	3281480	He survived multiple aneurysms.
3281480	3287480	Like, in a world where one is bad, he just has them
3287480	3293480	and comes up and reports into us from the edge of existence.
3293480	3299480	He's a visual artist who had his visual memory wiped out by some of these things
3299480	3301480	and is retraining his brain to see things.
3301480	3302480	It's very cool.
3302480	3304480	You should watch the podcast.
3304480	3305480	Listen to it.
3308480	3311480	That was for the three people who walked into the Vista tonight.
3311480	3313480	What's the end of the movie, Martha?
3313480	3316480	Their skeleton point is weird.
3317480	3319480	Bill Hader's not in this at all.
3319480	3320480	Why am I plugging?
3320480	3321480	I'm plugging Zeke.
3321480	3322480	You know who Zeke is.
3322480	3324480	Kristen Wiig looks different.
3326480	3327480	I've been trying to get...
3327480	3330480	I want to get Rob Shropp up here, but he just fucking left.
3331480	3333480	The only time he...
3333480	3334480	He's like shropping me.
3334480	3335480	He's like shropping me.
3335480	3336480	Yeah.
3336480	3338480	He reverse-shropped me.
3340480	3341480	He's probably getting popcorn or something.
3341480	3344480	Should we call that the Q&A?
3344480	3345480	Yes.
3345480	3349480	And then we'll do a little title sequence for a very short Harman Town.
3349480	3350480	Yeah, let's do it.
3350480	3351480	And then we can decide an editing radius.
3351480	3352480	Oh, look who walked back in.
3353480	3355480	All right, let's do it.
3355480	3357480	Thanks, Neil Berkley, for directing that movie.
3357480	3358480	Thank you.
3358480	3359480	I made the movie for you.
3359480	3360480	Thank you.
3360480	3361480	No, don't.
3361480	3362480	Don't do that.
3362480	3363480	Don't.
3363480	3365480	When does the podcast start?
3366480	3367480	Motherfucker.
3367480	3369480	You motherfucker.
3370480	3371480	Shropp.
3372480	3374480	Is the universe helping you?
3375480	3376480	How did you know?
3376480	3378480	Is God on your side?
3378480	3381480	How did you know the timing that that's what we were talking about?
3381480	3382480	I had no idea.
3382480	3383480	You opened the door.
3383480	3387480	You ran in as he started saying, we're going to start the podcast.
3387480	3390480	You come up to the microphone and you do a live shropp.
3390480	3391480	The nose, nose.
3392480	3394480	We're live shropping right now.
3394480	3395480	All right, I'm going to introduce that.
3395480	3397480	My Uber is like...
3397480	3398480	No, no.
3398480	3399480	It's a $10 penalty.
3399480	3401480	Just don't we want him on the podcast?
3401480	3402480	It'll be great.
3402480	3403480	You don't have to do this.
3403480	3404480	Go get your Uber driver.
3404480	3405480	Bring him in here too.
3406480	3407480	Is that okay?
3407480	3408480	Yes.
3408480	3409480	Okay.
3409480	3410480	All right.
3410480	3411480	I'm going to do an intro.
3411480	3412480	All right.
3412480	3413480	I'll crouch down and...
3413480	3414480	All right.
3414480	3416480	We'll just start from scratch.
3416480	3421480	Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your guest comptroller, Kumail Nanjiani.
3421480	3423480	Harman Town is now in session.
3424480	3429480	Please welcome the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
3431480	3432480	Wow.
3432480	3434480	Thank you Los Angeles.
3434480	3435480	Thank you.
3435480	3437480	Boy, we had a Q&A.
3437480	3438480	Maybe you heard it.
3438480	3439480	Maybe you didn't.
3439480	3441480	We're not sure what we're doing.
3441480	3444480	It's a city of lights, a city of magic, a city of industry.
3444480	3447480	This is where the splicing and the shooting and the production happens,
3447480	3450480	and sometimes you're present for the production of things.
3451480	3452480	Dreams are made here.
3452480	3453480	Yeah.
3453480	3456480	They're manufactured here by the Katzenbergs and the Zemeckises,
3456480	3462480	and they're shuttled out through pneumatic tubes to the rest of the country
3462480	3466480	so that America can continue its dream of hegemony.
3468480	3472480	It's a culture war, and if you're listening, you've lost.
3475480	3479480	And we're here in the Pentagon of that culture war,
3479480	3481480	the Vista Theater in Las Feliz,
3481480	3485480	where a lot of you saw your first movies when you came to L.A.
3485480	3487480	I do love this theater, and it is awesome.
3487480	3489480	A lot of people come in here and they go,
3489480	3491480	I saw Reservoir Dogs here or something.
3491480	3495480	Everyone has some kind of story about a movie theater.
3495480	3500480	I wonder what formative movie Spencer's eight years old.
3500480	3502480	He doesn't know what we're talking about.
3502480	3504480	I'm also on the podcast.
3504480	3505480	Spencer Quinton did.
3505480	3507480	Oh, shit, Spencer's here. Yeah, yeah, sorry.
3507480	3509480	God damn it.
3509480	3511480	Well, yeah.
3511480	3513480	The listeners won't know.
3513480	3514480	Well, I mean, they will now, but...
3514480	3515480	We don't know what we're doing.
3515480	3516480	We don't know what we're doing.
3516480	3518480	I know what I'm doing.
3518480	3520480	Tap dancing.
3520480	3521480	Holy shit, look at him go.
3521480	3522480	Wow.
3522480	3524480	The carpet's too soft, you can't hear it.
3524480	3526480	Oh, my God, wow.
3526480	3527480	Holy shit, he's so nimble.
3527480	3529480	It's impressive, I know.
3529480	3531480	Well, why is that helicopter coming in?
3531480	3533480	He's part of it.
3533480	3535480	That's a helicopter?
3535480	3537480	Or is that you sucking noodles?
3537480	3540480	That's me eating noodles from the helicopter.
3540480	3542480	Helicopter's coming in with all kinds of chow me.
3542480	3545480	Oh, my God, look, what is happening?
3547480	3549480	Cherokees, this is the next thing we're doing.
3549480	3553480	The next thing we're going to do is answer it.
3553480	3556480	Oh, yeah, the next thing we'll do is answer it.
3556480	3560480	Oh, yeah, the next thing we're going to answer is to answer it.
3560480	3562480	The next thing we're going to do is answer it.
3562480	3563480	Are we going to answer it?
3563480	3565480	I'm going to answer it.
3565480	3567480	Rob, come here.
3567480	3569480	Okay, Rob.
3569480	3571480	Rob is here.
3571480	3573480	Rob's come in with his Uber driver.
3573480	3574480	Come here.
3575480	3577480	Question number one.
3577480	3578480	Yeah, have a seat.
3578480	3579480	Question.
3579480	3582480	Is this the weirdest Uber ride you've ever given?
3582480	3583480	Yes.
3583480	3584480	Great.
3584480	3585480	RJ.
3587480	3588480	How many stars?
3588480	3589480	So, why couldn't wait?
3589480	3592480	You mean like he was going to take me home to feed my dog.
3592480	3594480	Your dog's fine.
3594480	3601480	So, Rob was leaving and we convinced him to come back in and bring his Uber driver.
3601480	3602480	And that's you?
3602480	3603480	Yes.
3603480	3605480	So, we have Uber questions.
3606480	3607480	Oh, no.
3607480	3608480	No.
3608480	3609480	Don't do that.
3609480	3611480	He's being nice enough.
3611480	3612480	Okay.
3612480	3613480	Are you uncomfortable up here?
3613480	3615480	If you don't want to be up here, you can totally leave.
3615480	3619480	I'm sure he's used to being on stage in front of hundreds of people.
3621480	3622480	Yes.
3622480	3627480	Is it RJ the letters or is it spelled RJ?
3627480	3628480	Like it's like a...
3628480	3630480	Like R2D2.
3631480	3633480	Were you here for that?
3633480	3634480	No.
3634480	3635480	I was here for that.
3635480	3638480	That's when I went, I got to get the fuck out of here.
3638480	3639480	All right.
3639480	3641480	Let RJ answer.
3641480	3643480	It's spelled A-R-J-E-I.
3643480	3646480	A-R-G-J-J-E-I.
3646480	3648480	What nationality is that?
3648480	3649480	Filipino.
3650480	3651480	Oh, there's some...
3651480	3653480	Canolis in the house, right?
3653480	3654480	Canolis?
3654480	3656480	What did you call that?
3656480	3657480	That doesn't sound...
3657480	3659480	Yeah, I'm really bad at racism.
3660480	3661480	What did you say?
3662480	3663480	Pinoy, right?
3663480	3665480	It's a slang for Filipino.
3665480	3666480	Okay.
3666480	3668480	I have Pinoy friends.
3669480	3670480	What?
3670480	3672480	What did you call them?
3672480	3673480	You heard me.
3673480	3674480	That's a hard Y.
3674480	3676480	You can't say it like that.
3676480	3680480	When did you just only read the novelization of races?
3684480	3687480	I'm doing all these callbacks to jokes that these guys did.
3687480	3688480	I'm sorry, RJ.
3688480	3689480	Don't worry about it, RJ.
3689480	3693480	RJ, you sound like a sexy news anchor in spite of being Filipino.
3693480	3696480	Are you second generation or are you parents from the Philippines?
3696480	3697480	Yes.
3697480	3698480	Okay.
3698480	3700480	So is English your second language?
3700480	3701480	Yeah.
3701480	3702480	Oh, okay.
3702480	3705480	So when you speak to your parents, what language do you speak?
3705480	3707480	A little bit of both.
3707480	3708480	What's the other one?
3708480	3709480	Tagalog.
3709480	3710480	I'm trying to like...
3710480	3711480	What's the other one?
3711480	3712480	I don't know what they...
3712480	3713480	Tagalog.
3713480	3714480	What is that?
3714480	3715480	Tagalog.
3715480	3716480	Oh, Tagalog.
3716480	3717480	Tagalog.
3718480	3719480	Most Americans would say it.
3719480	3720480	Yeah.
3720480	3722480	What's the biggest movie star in your country?
3722480	3723480	What the fuck?
3728480	3729480	I have no idea.
3729480	3730480	Oh, okay.
3731480	3732480	What's the biggest line?
3732480	3733480	It's a great answer.
3733480	3734480	Manny Pacquiao.
3734480	3735480	What's that?
3735480	3736480	Oh, yeah.
3736480	3737480	Manny Pacquiao.
3737480	3738480	Yeah.
3738480	3739480	Star of...
3739480	3740480	Fighting.
3740480	3741480	He's a boxer.
3741480	3742480	He punches.
3742480	3743480	Okay.
3744480	3746480	Star of a vet.
3746480	3747480	All right.
3747480	3749480	Does he do commercials?
3749480	3750480	Does he sell things?
3750480	3751480	He does, yeah.
3751480	3753480	How come he's answering his question?
3753480	3755480	Hey, I know everything.
3755480	3757480	I can't help it.
3757480	3758480	It's true.
3758480	3759480	You missed that part.
3759480	3760480	Yeah.
3760480	3761480	There's a whole movie about it.
3761480	3762480	He sells...
3762480	3763480	He sells...
3763480	3764480	What?
3764480	3765480	Punches.
3765480	3766480	Yeah, that's true.
3766480	3768480	Two-face.
3768480	3771480	To other people's jaw.
3771480	3772480	You let him answer.
3772480	3773480	Yeah.
3773480	3774480	You let him...
3774480	3775480	RJ.
3775480	3776480	He doesn't sell anything.
3776480	3777480	It's right.
3779480	3780480	He boxes.
3780480	3781480	He boxes.
3781480	3782480	He's good at it.
3782480	3783480	Okay.
3783480	3784480	I had a question.
3784480	3785480	Who is the...
3785480	3789480	What neighboring community...
3789480	3793480	Filipinos, when they do their jokes about like,
3793480	3796480	oh, yeah, he's probably a so-and-so.
3796480	3797480	Like Polish jokes?
3797480	3798480	Yeah, exactly.
3798480	3799480	What's your...
3799480	3802480	When I was in Milwaukee, it was Katahe.
3802480	3804480	Like we would go, oh, yeah, in Katahe.
3804480	3805480	Fuck those people.
3805480	3807480	It was just like a random thing.
3807480	3808480	You go to Boston and then we're like...
3808480	3809480	What's Katahe?
3809480	3811480	It's just some suburb of Milwaukee.
3811480	3812480	Oh, okay, okay.
3812480	3813480	It's just like, what, is there a neighbor?
3813480	3814480	Is there a place?
3814480	3815480	You had the thing...
3815480	3818480	Well, yeah, Pakistan, for Pakistan, Patans are the ones that were like, oh...
3818480	3819480	Patans.
3819480	3820480	Yeah.
3820480	3821480	There's a patan in the house?
3821480	3822480	Patans is the audience.
3822480	3827480	In the Philippines, is there like a...
3827480	3832480	Is there a group that people refer to as kind of like the...
3832480	3835480	I don't know, the failures, the assholes, the scapegoats?
3835480	3836480	Jokes.
3836480	3837480	Jokes.
3837480	3838480	The people you make fun of?
3838480	3840480	Second generation.
3840480	3841480	No, but...
3841480	3844480	Well, his parents probably mentioned something.
3844480	3845480	No?
3845480	3847480	This could go really bad very quickly.
3847480	3849480	You're really pulling me in a spot.
3849480	3853480	He just says, Muslims, and then the whole theater just explodes.
3853480	3855480	I'm so sorry.
3856480	3858480	We didn't even have a chance to explain.
3858480	3859480	No, if you...
3859480	3860480	I mean, if you...
3860480	3863480	If you don't know, the answer isn't immediate, then that means...
3863480	3864480	I don't know.
3864480	3866480	Well, I'm gonna ask you a question that...
3866480	3871480	It's the most obvious one, but like, what are the swear words you guys use?
3871480	3872480	Like, what...
3872480	3874480	Do you guys say...
3874480	3877480	The most famous one I know is putangina.
3877480	3879480	What is it?
3879480	3880480	Anybody blushing?
3880480	3881480	Can I guess?
3881480	3882480	Putangina?
3882480	3883480	Putangina.
3883480	3884480	What does it mean?
3884480	3885480	Can I guess?
3885480	3886480	It's like, yeah.
3886480	3887480	Go ahead.
3887480	3888480	Okay.
3889480	3891480	Having sex with your sister and both...
3891480	3892480	Everyone enjoys it.
3894480	3895480	Tiny pussy.
3895480	3897480	That's a tiny pussy.
3897480	3898480	Huge pussy.
3898480	3900480	A disreputable person.
3900480	3901480	Yeah.
3903480	3905480	This is a great game show.
3905480	3906480	We should get prizes.
3906480	3912480	A dog's belly that has eaten the sperm of a child.
3912480	3913480	Sorry.
3914480	3917480	I like that you followed up with sorry.
3917480	3920480	Like, your job was to be diplomatic in that moment.
3920480	3921480	Sorry.
3921480	3922480	I may have...
3922480	3923480	I think I fucked that one up.
3923480	3924480	If we do have a warning...
3924480	3927480	I was trying to guess Filipino profanity.
3927480	3928480	But I think I fucked up.
3928480	3930480	I think I went too specific.
3930480	3933480	A dog's belly filled with a kid's sperm.
3933480	3934480	That's great.
3934480	3936480	You should be proud of yourself.
3936480	3937480	Thank you.
3937480	3938480	Thank you.
3938480	3939480	We have a warning order for that.
3939480	3940480	I really missed you.
3940480	3941480	I'm joking.
3942480	3943480	RJ, what does putangina mean?
3943480	3944480	Who's closest?
3944480	3945480	Your mom is a whore.
3945480	3946480	Oh.
3946480	3947480	Oh, that's bad.
3947480	3948480	I wasn't that close.
3948480	3950480	That's bad.
3950480	3951480	That's bad.
3951480	3952480	Terrible.
3952480	3953480	That's bad.
3953480	3954480	No one wants to hear that.
3954480	3955480	No.
3955480	3956480	Except me.
3956480	3957480	I never...
3957480	3958480	Is it me?
3958480	3959480	I couldn't...
3959480	3961480	When I was a kid, I didn't give a shit.
3961480	3962480	Yeah.
3962480	3963480	Well, I'm saying.
3963480	3966480	Your mom fucked a million dudes.
3966480	3967480	I know.
3967480	3968480	I hope so.
3968480	3969480	I've been telling everybody.
3969480	3970480	Yeah.
3970480	3972480	She seems pretty boring to me.
3973480	3976480	Give us one more, RJ.
3976480	3977480	One more swear word.
3977480	3978480	Okay.
3978480	3979480	If that was...
3979480	3980480	Of course.
3980480	3981480	If that one was like...
3981480	3982480	Okay.
3982480	3991480	So, like, in English, darn, hell, shit, fuck, C word.
3991480	3992480	Okay.
3992480	3993480	That's the...
3993480	3995480	That's my personal prison.
3995480	3997480	That's probably motherfucker after fuck.
3997480	3998480	But yeah.
3998480	3999480	Yeah.
3999480	4000480	Goddamn.
4000480	4001480	Whatever.
4001480	4002480	So...
4002480	4003480	You left out Schmendrik.
4003480	4004480	Where was that?
4004480	4005480	Schmendrik?
4005480	4006480	I don't know.
4006480	4007480	Okay.
4007480	4008480	Okay.
4008480	4009480	So, if that would...
4009480	4013120	That wasn't what you just said, received, like, you know, kind of, like, like a five.
4013120	4014120	What's a ten?
4014120	4016120	What's a ten?
4016120	4021520	The worst Filipino thing you could say.
4021520	4025960	If you were on the radio in the Philippines, and you were like a shock jock.
4025960	4026960	What would...
4026960	4027960	Good morning, Philippines.
4027960	4028960	Good morning, Philippines.
4028960	4034520	I'm Toby the Tube Johnson.
4034520	4035520	And you're like...
4035520	4039800	People are relying on you to be counter-culture, and subversive, and yet...
4039800	4040800	You're Toby the Tube Johnson.
4040800	4043800	But then he said...
4043800	4045400	Like, okay.
4045400	4047400	Let me phrase it another way.
4047400	4052320	When you're in English having a fight with your significant other, there's certain words
4052320	4055640	that when there happens, it's like, all right, now it's going to take a little bit for us
4055640	4058040	to get past this.
4059040	4062040	Game of Thrones spoilers.
4062040	4063040	Yeah.
4063040	4064040	Game of Thrones spoilers.
4064040	4065040	Like, it would...
4065040	4068200	Like, the C word, you know, you throw that out there, that's a big one.
4068200	4070200	Now you got to, like, backtrack and stuff.
4070200	4075400	What's the one that if you're in a fight with a lady from the Philippines, the word you
4075400	4079040	say, and it's like, oh, no, I fucked up.
4079040	4081040	Oh, shit.
4081040	4082040	It's shit?
4082040	4083040	No.
4083040	4085960	It's pretty mild.
4085960	4087360	Or just another one.
4087360	4088360	Or intense.
4088360	4089360	Ulul.
4089360	4090360	What is it?
4090360	4091360	What is it?
4091360	4092360	It's elegant.
4092360	4093360	It's U-L-O-L.
4093360	4094360	Ulul?
4094360	4095360	Yeah.
4095360	4096360	What is that?
4096360	4098360	No, no, no, no.
4098360	4099360	Let's guess.
4099360	4100360	Play the game.
4100360	4101360	That's definitely...
4101360	4103360	I know exactly what that is.
4103360	4105360	Let's see.
4105360	4110360	Like, an overly circular dish.
4110360	4115360	It's too circular.
4116360	4125360	A flat clitoris.
4125360	4132360	The biggest crime of all.
4132360	4133360	You know what you are?
4133360	4135360	Well, you know what you are?
4135360	4137360	I like the hand gesture.
4137360	4139360	A flat clitoris.
4139360	4141360	That is not true.
4141360	4142360	That is not true.
4142360	4145360	Mine is three dimensional.
4145360	4146360	It's bulbous.
4146360	4151360	I better get a water bottle on the way home here.
4151360	4152360	Okay, good.
4152360	4153360	No, he's thinking...
4153360	4154360	Yeah, he should get water.
4154360	4155360	I should drive you home.
4155360	4158360	This is instant five stars, at least.
4158360	4162360	Plug it in your thing as we went to Santa Monica three times.
4162360	4163360	Yeah.
4163360	4166360	Obviously, we'll give you five stars both ways.
4166360	4167360	Of course.
4167360	4169360	Obviously, it's simply...
4169360	4174360	It's simply just a woman's private parts.
4174360	4175360	That's it.
4175360	4176360	There's no nuance to it at all.
4176360	4177360	I just...
4177360	4178360	No?
4178360	4179360	He's shaking his head, okay.
4179360	4180360	It's not?
4180360	4190360	Okay, it's a guy who was born from an asshole.
4190360	4192360	That's probably the closest thing to it.
4192360	4193360	Oh, really?
4193360	4194360	I'm on fire.
4194360	4196360	I should have been a dollar over that.
4197360	4198360	So what is it?
4198360	4199360	What is it?
4199360	4200360	No, it's just...
4200360	4206360	I'm not really sure either, but it's just like...
4206360	4211360	I think it's really, really, really, really stupid.
4211360	4212360	I got it.
4212360	4213360	But it's that...
4213360	4217360	And for you, that is closest to a guy born from an asshole.
4217360	4218360	Yes.
4218360	4220360	So it's like you're an oaf.
4220360	4222360	You're an asshole.
4222360	4225360	It's almost equivalent to that.
4225360	4232360	But in your parents' language, that is approaching the C word.
4232360	4233360	It's really...
4233360	4236360	If you said that when you were a kid, your mom would slap you and go, don't say that.
4236360	4238360	I actually got spanked for that.
4238360	4240360	Because you said it to your sister or something.
4240360	4245360	What was the circumstance that made you say that in front of your mother?
4245360	4246360	It wasn't my mom.
4246360	4247360	Oh, okay.
4247360	4249360	It was my aunt.
4249360	4251360	Was she being a... what you said?
4251360	4253360	No, no, no, no, no.
4253360	4254360	I just said it.
4254360	4256360	Out of expression.
4256360	4257360	Oh, okay.
4257360	4260360	It sounds kind of beautiful.
4260360	4261360	It's not harsh.
4261360	4262360	It's like...
4262360	4263360	There's no consonants.
4263360	4264360	It sounds like music.
4264360	4265360	Oulu.
4265360	4266360	There's consonants.
4266360	4267360	Which is...
4271360	4276360	In Urdu, that's the language you see in Pakistan, Oulu is a...
4276360	4278360	It means stupid.
4278360	4279360	And we call...
4279360	4282360	And I bet they're related because we're pretty close to each other geographically.
4282360	4287360	Oulu means something stupid, but it's also the word for owl, which here are considered
4287360	4288360	smart.
4288360	4295360	I don't have a thing to combine those, but aren't we all different in wonderful ways?
4295360	4297360	Well, here's something.
4297360	4303360	In America, a fanny is your butt, but in England, it's your vagina.
4303360	4304360	Yeah.
4304360	4305360	Yep.
4305360	4312360	And a friend of my wife's had this stuff called fanny cream.
4312360	4316360	It's supposed to tighten your fanny or whatever?
4316360	4317360	Which fanny?
4317360	4318360	Which fanny American fanny?
4318360	4319360	It's supposed to be...
4319360	4324360	It's an American fanny, but her British friends came over and said...
4324360	4326360	How weird.
4326360	4330360	Why do you have tightening fanny cream?
4330360	4333360	Oh, it's just tightening your butt.
4333360	4334360	That's normal.
4334360	4335360	I get it now.
4335360	4337360	Why would anyone want to tighten their butt?
4337360	4338360	You should see how loose their butt is.
4338360	4339360	That's way more normal.
4339360	4340360	Taking their butt.
4340360	4342360	Yeah, why are they tightening...
4342360	4343360	Oh, no.
4343360	4344360	I heard this second hand.
4344360	4346360	Don't ask for details, man.
4346360	4348360	You're being a real oolol.
4348360	4349360	Yeah.
4349360	4350360	Admitted.
4350360	4352360	Have you gone back, RJ?
4352360	4356360	I mean, not back, but have you visited the Philippines?
4356360	4358360	No, for 20 years.
4358360	4359360	How old are you?
4359360	4360360	Can I ask?
4360360	4361360	You seem kind of young.
4361360	4362360	33.
4362360	4363360	Oh, okay.
4363360	4365360	So you're my age.
4365360	4367360	Don't laugh that quick.
4367360	4368360	Don't laugh that quick.
4368360	4369360	Are your parents here in the States?
4369360	4371360	Yeah, they are here.
4371360	4375360	So you haven't been in the homeland for 20 years, you said?
4375360	4378360	Pretty much, yeah.
4378360	4381360	Do you like candles?
4381360	4382360	I don't know.
4382360	4385360	I like how thoughtful...
4385360	4390360	We're like, what would NPR ask you?
4390360	4398360	I had Filipino food once, and I went to Jollibee's, a Filipino place, right?
4398360	4400360	But I didn't go there.
4400360	4401360	Really?
4401360	4402360	Have you been there?
4402360	4403360	Wait, really?
4403360	4405360	No, it's kind of good, isn't it?
4405360	4406360	This wasn't Jollibee.
4406360	4407360	It's fine.
4407360	4408360	I went to a place and I got...
4408360	4409360	I was like...
4409360	4410360	It wasn't Jollibee.
4410360	4411360	It was just...
4411360	4412360	And I was like, oh, I'll get this.
4412360	4413360	And it was...
4413360	4418360	What it was, was there was a purple soup with bones in it, and I didn't know what part
4418360	4420360	to eat and what part to throw away.
4420360	4425360	Shield of monkey brains.
4425360	4427360	Exotic, exotic food.
4427360	4431360	Did you eat the bones and throw out the soup?
4431360	4433360	Yeah, I'm a real oolool.
4433360	4434360	Yeah.
4434360	4436360	You got purple...
4436360	4438360	It was a purple liquid with bones in it.
4438360	4440360	Do you know what that's called?
4440360	4441360	I don't know what you're talking about.
4441360	4442360	You know what?
4442360	4443360	I bet they were like, fuck this guy.
4443360	4444360	Yeah.
4448360	4450360	So your whole family's over here now.
4450360	4451360	All in L.A.?
4451360	4452360	Yeah.
4452360	4453360	L.A.?
4453360	4454360	L.A.?
4454360	4455360	Yeah.
4455360	4456360	How long have you been Ubering?
4456360	4458360	A month.
4458360	4459360	Oh.
4459360	4460360	And how has it been?
4460360	4461360	Is it fun?
4461360	4462360	It's been fun.
4462360	4465360	How many podcasts have you done?
4465360	4467360	Let me see.
4467360	4473360	Like, when I tapped on the window and I said, hey, do you mind coming in for a second?
4473360	4474360	There's a little show going.
4474360	4476360	Actually, I didn't know what I was talking about.
4477360	4478360	And I opened the door.
4478360	4479360	There's all these people.
4479360	4482360	And I remember you saying, oh.
4484360	4485360	Oh, this again.
4487360	4489360	One of these, eh?
4490360	4494360	Yeah, I just dropped Marc Maron off at Andy Daley's house the other day.
4495360	4496360	I guess this is my life now.
4496360	4499360	What I'm saying is you're being an incredibly amazing sport.
4499360	4500360	Thank you so much.
4500360	4501360	Yeah, thank you.
4501360	4502360	That's for sure, yeah.
4507360	4511360	RJ, what's your favorite episode of Community?
4512360	4516360	Do you have any idea what's going on here?
4517360	4518360	No idea.
4519360	4521360	There's no shame in that.
4521360	4522360	There's no shame in that.
4522360	4525360	Do you know a show called Community on NBC?
4525360	4526360	Mm-mm.
4526360	4527360	There's no shame in that either.
4527360	4528360	What about Park, Parks and Rec?
4528360	4530360	You ever hear of Parks and Rec?
4530360	4531360	Uh-uh.
4531360	4532360	Brooklyn Nine-Nine?
4532360	4533360	Uh-uh.
4533360	4534360	What shows do you like?
4534360	4535360	The Seinfeld.
4535360	4536360	What's uplifting?
4537360	4538360	Walking Dead.
4538360	4539360	Okay.
4539360	4540360	It's a classic.
4543360	4544360	Do you watch Orphan Black?
4547360	4548360	No.
4548360	4549360	Well, you should.
4549360	4550360	What channel is it?
4550360	4551360	I don't even know.
4551360	4552360	I haven't seen Orphan Black.
4552360	4553360	I'm a BBC American.
4553360	4554360	All the writers won't shut up about it.
4554360	4555360	I haven't seen Orphan Black.
4556360	4560360	What's been your worst Uber experience other than this one?
4562360	4563360	Seriously, have you had like a bad one?
4563360	4565360	What makes you give a guy a low rating?
4565360	4566360	Yeah, yeah.
4566360	4567360	As we know you rated.
4567360	4568360	Oh, yeah.
4568360	4570360	Yeah, that's the question.
4570360	4572360	Why do I have a 4.8?
4572360	4573360	Why not 5?
4573360	4576360	When I have only ever given all of you a 5.
4576360	4577360	Why do I have a 4.8?
4577360	4578360	All of you a 5.
4578360	4579360	Yeah, all of you.
4579360	4580360	It's not a race.
4580360	4581360	They're Uber drivers.
4582360	4583360	It's not a race.
4583360	4585360	Has there ever been a night where you were just like,
4585360	4588360	Urgh, you need to get the fuck out.
4588360	4589360	All right, let him just slow down.
4589360	4591360	You need to get out.
4591360	4592360	Let him answer.
4592360	4595360	You need to get out.
4595360	4597360	No, you need to get out.
4597360	4598360	I like it.
4598360	4603360	I'm saying you need to get out now.
4603360	4605360	No, no.
4605360	4608360	My favorite part is that you're looking into the rear view mirror
4608360	4609360	when you're doing that.
4609360	4612360	Yeah, that is great object work.
4612360	4615360	You need to get out.
4615360	4618360	He gots to go.
4618360	4619360	Have you had to kick anyone out?
4619360	4621360	I haven't had a bad experience yet.
4621360	4622360	What's the lowest?
4622360	4624360	You give passengers ratings.
4624360	4625360	I have a 4.8.
4625360	4627360	Why do you think?
4627360	4628360	I don't even know.
4628360	4629360	I have a 4.7 rating.
4629360	4630360	I don't know why.
4630360	4632360	Let's change that tonight.
4632360	4635360	Do you give passengers 5s all the time?
4635360	4638360	Have you ever given not a 5 to anybody?
4638360	4639360	No, not yet.
4639360	4640360	Never.
4640360	4641360	I figure the metric is...
4641360	4645360	How do you feel that that undermines the whole concept of a star rating system?
4645360	4649360	Because if 5s are the only one that anyone's choosing,
4649360	4653360	it's kind of like you're just choosing zeros.
4653360	4657360	Well, all businesses have this problem.
4657360	4660360	It's a real issue where you have to give the maximum result.
4660360	4663360	What are the top businesses that have this problem?
4663360	4667360	You know, I'd say Apple Incorporated does a really good job with it.
4667360	4670360	But, you know, for instance, Borders tried it for a while.
4670360	4671360	You saw how that goes.
4671360	4673360	Barnes and Noble didn't, as it happens.
4673360	4675360	Well, if Apple's doing so good, how come...
4675360	4678360	Because they don't focus on only the 9s and 10s.
4678360	4679360	That's what everyone does.
4679360	4681360	They're like, if it's a 9 or a 10, it's fine.
4681360	4682360	Otherwise, you're fired.
4682360	4686360	And that's not constructive because sometimes you only get a C and that's great.
4686360	4687360	What are you supposed to do?
4687360	4690360	Look at the 5s and go like...
4690360	4693360	You look at the 3s and you go like, oh, these guys.
4693360	4694360	What went wrong?
4694360	4695360	And then you fix it.
4695360	4696360	Meow meow meow.
4696360	4697360	Meow meow meow.
4697360	4698360	Meow meow meow.
4698360	4702360	But also, like, you worked under that regime and now you work...
4702360	4703360	Now you left them.
4703360	4704360	You bailed.
4704360	4705360	Uh-huh.
4705360	4707360	I waved a dollar in your face.
4707360	4708360	Uh-huh.
4708360	4710360	And you were like, fuck this Apple business.
4710360	4711360	Uh-huh.
4711360	4712360	Fuck Steve Jobs.
4712360	4713360	Yeah.
4713360	4714360	He used to work at Apple.
4714360	4715360	I used to work at Apple, RJ.
4715360	4717360	Now he works with Dan.
4717360	4718360	Sorry.
4718360	4719360	Yeah.
4719360	4720360	We're leaving RJ out.
4720360	4721360	Sorry.
4721360	4722360	Sorry, RJ.
4722360	4723360	Is this the worst of the best podcast episodes?
4723360	4724360	It's the best.
4724360	4725360	Okay.
4725360	4726360	I'm pretty excited about that.
4726360	4727360	Okay.
4727360	4728360	All right.
4728360	4731360	I just want to make sure we really, really kick it into...
4731360	4733360	RJ, do you believe in God?
4733360	4734360	Yes.
4734360	4736360	What do you think God is?
4736360	4737360	Like, do you think it's like...
4737360	4740360	Do you think it would be something that you could see?
4740360	4741360	Or do you...
4741360	4742360	Is God personal to you?
4742360	4746360	Or do you believe in a God that you think is, like, able to...
4746360	4750360	Like, do you think that God is the same from one person to the next?
4750360	4756360	Or do you think God is personal to you?
4756360	4758360	You can take as long as you want.
4758360	4761360	Truthfully, that's not supposed to be an instant answer.
4761360	4764360	No, he gets paid by the...
4764360	4767360	He can't take as long as he wants.
4767360	4769360	He's for this right now.
4769360	4770360	Is the meter running right now?
4770360	4771360	Yes, the meter's running.
4771360	4772360	I said...
4772360	4773360	I haven't started yet.
4773360	4774360	No, no, no.
4774360	4775360	You're starting.
4775360	4776360	Start it.
4776360	4777360	You...
4777360	4780360	Please.
4780360	4784360	You can think as long as you want and then start the meter.
4784360	4787360	I guess it's personal to me.
4787360	4788360	Yeah.
4788360	4790360	Like, it's between you and the unknown.
4790360	4791360	All right.
4791360	4793360	That's the right answer.
4793360	4796360	I concede.
4796360	4797360	I'm sorry.
4797360	4798360	You're right, Dan.
4798360	4801360	I feel like people should understand that religion is like a thing.
4801360	4803360	It's not other people's business.
4803360	4806360	It should have a small case R.
4806360	4808360	But not to mean that it's not important.
4808360	4809360	It's the most important thing in the world.
4809360	4811360	It's like shoes or pants.
4811360	4813360	You don't fucking wear pants that fit other people.
4813360	4815360	No.
4815360	4817360	You're picking shoes.
4817360	4818360	Same with shoes.
4818360	4820360	You don't wear shoes.
4820360	4828360	We have been trained in our society to think that religion is somehow the domain of idiots,
4828360	4832360	fundamentalists, people who decided things.
4832360	4837360	And if we think about religion, we decide things about ourselves and we have to pick something.
4837360	4838360	Like, we don't...
4838360	4842360	We sit and we talk about, this TV show is good, but I only like this part.
4842360	4844360	I like the Shakira song, but I only like the bridge.
4844360	4846360	And I actually think I like her influence on this.
4846360	4848360	And we pick and choose.
4848360	4853360	We mythologize our consumption about everything except for the most important thing in the world to primates
4853360	4858360	since thunder, clapped, and lightning hit our monkey friend, religion.
4858360	4860360	Why do we die?
4860360	4862360	Why does the universe not give a fuck about us?
4862360	4864360	It's like an important thing.
4864360	4866360	And we let it sit.
4866360	4870360	And we go, well, my parents were Lutheran, so I guess I don't give a fuck about that.
4870360	4871360	It's religion.
4871360	4875360	It's like one man's business between you and the unknown.
4875360	4878360	God damn it, I'm great.
4884360	4887360	When is the world going to catch up?
4887360	4888360	I think...
4888360	4889360	Look at all these people here.
4889360	4891360	They're all right.
4891360	4893360	They're good people.
4893360	4894360	Yeah.
4894360	4897360	I just want to make this a good podcast.
4897360	4899360	I'm going to go beyond that.
4899360	4902360	That was an easy shot.
4902360	4906360	Has anyone in the room ever stolen anything?
4906360	4909360	Oh, RJ has.
4909360	4910360	Yes!
4910360	4912360	Okay, let's start with RJ.
4912360	4913360	Let's start with RJ.
4913360	4917360	Are you willing to talk about it when you stole something?
4917360	4919360	What did you steal?
4919360	4920360	You don't have to talk about it.
4920360	4921360	You're not going to get caught.
4921360	4927360	How many RJ's could there be running Uber in Los Feliz?
4927360	4929360	I can steal money from my parents.
4929360	4930360	That's fine.
4930360	4931360	I did that too, yeah.
4931360	4932360	I stole money from your parents.
4932360	4933360	Everyone's going to press charges.
4933360	4936360	Just like out of their purses and wallets and stuff?
4936360	4937360	No, eat like mug them.
4937360	4938360	Yeah.
4941360	4942360	To get what?
4942360	4944360	They're like, son?
4944360	4946360	What did you need so bad?
4946360	4950360	I remember he wanted baseball stickers and like just the most random shit.
4950360	4954360	What did you need so bad that you would go into your parents' room and like...
4954360	4957360	I was just mad at them, so I tried to get back at them by stealing money.
4957360	4958360	Well, you did.
4958360	4959360	What did you buy with it?
4959360	4960360	Cigarettes or what?
4960360	4961360	Food.
4962360	4963360	Food?
4963360	4965360	Revenge is what he bought.
4966360	4968360	No, the revenge was free.
4970360	4975360	Who stole something that they think is genuinely like...
4975360	4979360	Yeah, what I like is that this dude's raising his hand and the guy next to him is pointing at him.
4979360	4980360	He knows.
4980360	4981360	This is the reason.
4981360	4982360	He's like, believe me, I've heard about this.
4982360	4983360	He stole it from me.
4983360	4984360	I know.
4984360	4985360	It was great.
4985360	4987360	Will you come up and tell us about the thing you stole?
4987360	4989360	You didn't steal it from the gentleman, right?
4989360	4990360	No.
4990360	4991360	Okay.
4991360	4992360	I stole a baby.
4992360	4993360	It's from someone here?
4993360	4994360	Yes.
4994360	4995360	Oh, shit.
4995360	4996360	Okay.
4996360	4997360	It's the guy next to him.
4997360	5000360	He's like, he stole my life force.
5001360	5003360	So, I'm a huge community fan.
5003360	5009360	I'm a huge community fan and I was lucky enough to find myself with unsupervised access to...
5009360	5010360	What?
5010360	5012360	Yeah, to the set one day.
5012360	5023360	And so, to take advantage of that or to show my thanks for that, I took a community pendant off the wall.
5023360	5024360	Damn.
5024360	5031360	And at some point, further on, at Channel 101, I had you sign it and got it okayed with you that I had taken it.
5031360	5033360	It was like a poster on the wall?
5033360	5034360	It was a pendant.
5034360	5035360	What's a pendant?
5035360	5036360	It's like the triangle flag.
5036360	5037360	Oh, a pendant.
5037360	5038360	A glass pendant.
5038360	5039360	Oh, a pendant.
5039360	5040360	Sorry.
5040360	5041360	Excuse me.
5041360	5045360	And it has the old community logo with the flag draped without wind.
5045360	5046360	That's cool.
5046360	5049360	I'm pretty sure a prop guy was fired for losing it.
5049360	5054360	No, I would say two years ago, I would be like, you did what?
5054360	5056360	To my sacred temple.
5056360	5062360	But then, I found out every season, Sony just fucking shovels that shit into an incinerator.
5062360	5066360	They're like, we got to make room for the good wife for Shark Tank or whatever.
5066360	5070360	They're like, that's going to cost $8 to store this.
5070360	5071360	We don't know.
5071360	5077360	Let's get rid of these frog sombreros and shit that I would have fucking taken everything,
5077360	5078360	everything.
5078360	5079360	What?
5079360	5081360	That's Brita's shoe from the Brita's shoe episode.
5081360	5083360	No, we burnt that.
5083360	5086360	That was worth more as ash.
5086360	5092360	We powered a train filled with Whitney Houston's greatest hits.
5092360	5097360	After her death, we needed to get those to the record store really quickly.
5097360	5106360	So we set fire to your set in the furnace on the Sony train.
5106360	5112360	Everything you did, everything you dedicated your life to, it's more valuable as steam.
5112360	5115360	So good job getting that pendant out of there.
5115360	5119360	I'm just glad I stole the Troy and Abbot dolls from the Christmas episode.
5119360	5125360	If I get absconded with those, the other ones are melting in the fucking sidewalk somewhere.
5125360	5128360	Sony train somewhere.
5128360	5130360	Anybody else stole something big?
5130360	5131360	Crazy.
5131360	5132360	Stole something weird.
5132360	5133360	There's a hand way in back.
5133360	5134360	Why don't we reward the prisoners?
5134360	5135360	Is it an intense thing?
5135360	5136360	Yeah.
5136360	5137360	Come on up.
5137360	5139360	Do you want to come?
5139360	5144360	We'll fill the time of you coming down here and talk about our new sponsor.
5144360	5145360	Squarespace.
5145360	5146360	Squarespace.
5146360	5149360	Hey, do you have a website?
5149360	5151360	What shape of spaces do you like?
5151360	5153360	Why don't you make your own website?
5153360	5155360	What the fuck is that shit?
5155360	5156360	Fuck Circle Space.
5156360	5158360	How much money are people making out of a Squarespace?
5158360	5159360	What are they offering?
5159360	5160360	500, what?
5160360	5161360	Just come on.
5161360	5162360	I'll rate you.
5162360	5167360	If you have a podcast and Squarespace comes to you, I will double their offer.
5167360	5168360	No.
5168360	5169360	I have a podcast.
5169360	5172360	If you don't mention Squarespace, I will double their offer.
5172360	5173360	And you advertise with them, right?
5173360	5174360	I advertise Squarespace.
5174360	5175360	Yes.
5175360	5176360	You just doubled your money.
5176360	5178360	What do they give you?
5178360	5179360	$70?
5179360	5180360	You just made $140.
5180360	5181360	They'll talk about it.
5181360	5182360	Yeah, we'll talk about it.
5183360	5184360	Round space.
5184360	5186360	I'm going to make up a new product.
5186360	5189360	I'm on board for it.
5189360	5191360	You could just get the mic out.
5191360	5193360	Yeah, there you go.
5193360	5194360	Okay.
5194360	5200360	First, let me justify it by saying I was a lot younger and I was homeless.
5200360	5201360	But I used to go...
5201360	5203360	Like Aladdin.
5203360	5205360	Like about 19.
5205360	5209360	And we're all agreeing in advance to reward your candor because we asked you to tell us
5209360	5210360	about something you stole.
5210360	5213360	We're not asking you to tell us about something you're proud of.
5213360	5218360	Like so, if this is shameful, we love it all the more.
5218360	5225360	I used to go to bars with a fake ID and I'd steal women's purses and then take them to
5225360	5230360	the bathroom and take their wallets out and take their money.
5230360	5233360	That's a pretty real one.
5233360	5235360	That's not a penny off a wall.
5235360	5239360	Yeah, then I'd return their purse to where it was.
5239360	5244360	You were at a stage in your life when you were homeless and you were going to bars.
5244360	5245360	And so you were just...
5245360	5246360	This is how you were living.
5246360	5249360	You were going to bars and you would just go, you know what?
5249360	5250360	Would you...
5250360	5252360	I'm curious about this.
5252360	5254360	Would you pick and choose who you would victimize?
5254360	5255360	Would you go...
5255360	5257360	That person deserves everyone.
5257360	5259360	It would be funny if you tried to engage them in conversation.
5259360	5262360	Like, how do you feel about black people?
5262360	5264360	Taking your wallet.
5264360	5270360	Usually it was people who were really loud and annoying or if they looked like they had
5270360	5271360	a lot of money on them.
5271360	5272360	Right, so you did...
5272360	5276360	There was a sense of karmic justice in your head.
5276360	5281360	Mostly wanting to have food in my belly.
5281360	5282360	Well, yes, there was that.
5282360	5286360	But having decided that you were going to do that carnivorously, you then also...
5286360	5292360	The human achievement is that whereas a fox would just eat a fucking baby gazelle.
5293360	5295360	It wouldn't go like, oh, that gazelle deserves this.
5295360	5297360	That gazelle is racist.
5297360	5301360	When humans cannibalize each other, we still have this compulsion to go,
5301360	5303360	oh, this person deserves it.
5303360	5305360	Prisoners get so excited about pedophiles.
5305360	5307360	Wait, you're a pedophile?
5307360	5310360	I get to rape you.
5310360	5312360	I'm so excited about rape.
5312360	5315360	Now I got a reason, old boy.
5318360	5321360	That's exactly right, actually.
5321360	5323360	What was your biggest haul?
5323360	5326360	What was the most money you ever got out of a purse?
5326360	5328360	Probably like $500.
5328360	5330360	$500?
5330360	5333360	Did you ever get caught or get close to being caught?
5333360	5334360	No, never.
5334360	5338360	Sounds like you're pretty thorough about it, pretty proficient.
5338360	5339360	Yeah.
5339360	5340360	That's awesome.
5340360	5343360	I still had a lot of things, but that was probably the worst.
5343360	5350360	I've stolen from parties and stores and stuff, but that was the most personal.
5350360	5353360	It seems like if you're willing to share this,
5353360	5357360	it seems like maybe this was a transition in your life.
5357360	5361360	I definitely got my karma.
5361360	5363360	Oh, well, what happened?
5363360	5366360	For the podcast listeners, she's rolled down the aisle in a wheelchair.
5366360	5367360	She's sharing this.
5367360	5369360	I didn't think to share this.
5369360	5372360	I got sick as I got older, and now I use a wheelchair.
5372360	5374360	What do you mean you got sick?
5374360	5378360	I got a rare illness called Ehlers-Danlos,
5378360	5382360	and my joints dislocate as I try and walk,
5382360	5385360	so now I have to use a wheelchair.
5385360	5386360	You look back on it and think,
5386360	5387360	oh, well, I was a bad person.
5387360	5390360	I deserve this, which you probably shouldn't do.
5390360	5395360	No, not that much, but if there is really karma, maybe.
5395360	5400360	That's nice of you to take that responsibility to do that.
5400360	5403360	I think that there's probably people in the room
5403360	5405360	who don't end up suffering misfortune
5405360	5407360	who probably do a lot of shitty stuff to other people.
5407360	5408360	Much worse things.
5408360	5412360	I don't know if it's helpful for you to think
5412360	5414360	that random stuff can happen to you.
5414360	5418360	It doesn't have to have to do with whether or not you're a good or bad person.
5418360	5422360	That might be helpful to you.
5422360	5429360	I have a million questions for you.
5429360	5433360	Why were you homeless?
5433360	5436360	I was really rebellious,
5436360	5441360	and I ran away from home a lot when I was a teenager.
5441360	5443360	Where did you live, if we can ask?
5443360	5445360	Where in the country?
5445360	5447360	California.
5447360	5449360	My parents just got sick of it,
5449360	5451360	and they were showing me tough love,
5451360	5453360	and they weren't letting me come back.
5453360	5455360	How old were you at that point?
5455360	5456360	18, 19.
5456360	5457360	Yeah.
5457360	5460360	I remember my brother tangled with drugs and stuff.
5460360	5462360	He was just smoking weed and stuff,
5462360	5463360	and my parents were like,
5463360	5464360	ah, you need help.
5464360	5467360	Sometimes parents are trying to like,
5467360	5469360	they don't know how to be parents,
5469360	5472360	and they're like, ah, you're a fuck-up kid.
5472360	5476360	I'm being a bad parent, so now you gotta...
5476360	5478360	Have you reconnected with them?
5478360	5479360	Oh yeah, I live with them now.
5479360	5480360	Okay.
5480360	5481360	Oh yeah?
5481360	5483360	Your parents live in California?
5483360	5485360	What is this condition?
5485360	5486360	I've never heard of it.
5486360	5488360	It's a connective tissue disorder.
5488360	5490360	It's hereditary.
5490360	5494360	So my collagen, instead of it being rubber bands,
5494360	5496360	it's kind of like loose noodles.
5496360	5502360	So all my tendons and everywhere that...
5502360	5503360	It's not as stretchy.
5503360	5505360	No, it's overly stretchy.
5505360	5506360	Over-stretchy.
5506360	5508360	Well, it's just wobbly.
5508360	5510360	It's like wibbly-wobbly.
5510360	5511360	It's just gone.
5511360	5514360	There's stuff in your body that keeps you...
5514360	5516360	If you were to go, it's over there,
5516360	5517360	and you pointed too hard,
5517360	5520360	your arm could fly out of your socket.
5520360	5525360	If I lift a carton of milk, my wrist will dislocate.
5525360	5528360	And you find out about this at what age?
5528360	5530360	I was like 27.
5530360	5536360	But I got five or six different wrong diagnoses.
5536360	5541360	I've been trying for seven years to get a diagnosis for it.
5541360	5543360	And when did you land on this diagnosis?
5543360	5544360	How recently?
5544360	5545360	It was two years ago.
5545360	5548360	Two years.
5548360	5553360	It's not that rare, but people don't get diagnosed properly.
5553360	5555360	So there's a lot of people who actually have it.
5555360	5558360	Because what's happening at first when people go to the doctor?
5558360	5561360	Not to inspire people listening to the podcast to go,
5561360	5564360	oh, my God, I have this, which is what I would do.
5564360	5570360	Well, first it was just joint pain and dislocations,
5570360	5574360	and then a bunch of other stuff started happening.
5574360	5578360	And how quickly was that?
5578360	5583360	It started when I was about 21, and I'm 29 now.
5583360	5585360	Well, I think a lot of us are walking around
5585360	5586360	with a lot of shitty stuff we did.
5586360	5587360	I don't know.
5587360	5588360	Not to beat a dead horse,
5588360	5590360	but I definitely don't think that you should think
5590360	5594360	that it had anything to do with anything that you've done.
5594360	5599360	I don't think it's direct karma for what I did.
5599360	5602360	But also, at the same time, you're like, okay,
5602360	5606360	I have a personal relationship with something.
5606360	5609360	And you're like, yeah, you're kind of balancing it out in your head.
5609360	5610360	What's your name?
5610360	5612360	Can we ask?
5612360	5614360	That's all right.
5614360	5615360	Yeah, okay.
5615360	5616360	That's fine.
5616360	5617360	Yeah, they're going to be like,
5617360	5622360	someone else has this disease that used to go to bars.
5622360	5625360	I think that might be Steve.
5625360	5627360	I just want to think that I have already,
5627360	5631360	since there's not really anybody else that my friends would know that have this.
5631360	5632360	But yeah, my name's Krista.
5632360	5633360	Oh, okay.
5633360	5635360	Well, thank you, Krista, for sharing.
5635360	5636360	We really appreciate that.
5636360	5637360	That's what I wanted.
5637360	5638360	I wanted...
5638360	5639360	You helped me.
5639360	5642360	You made my podcast amazing.
5642360	5644360	That's all I care about.
5644360	5646360	That's all I care about.
5646360	5650360	I suck your humanity out of your bodies.
5650360	5652360	That's all I care about.
5652360	5654360	It's a good podcast now.
5654360	5658360	This is how you get less than a five-star rating.
5658360	5659360	Thank you, Krista.
5659360	5660360	That was really touching.
5660360	5661360	That was...
5661360	5663360	I hope the sound mixing works.
5663360	5664360	Dustin, are you going to make sure that...
5664360	5665360	Yeah.
5665360	5666360	Does that sound good?
5666360	5667360	I think I'm sitting there with those headphones.
5667360	5671360	How would you know you had headphones on during the whole thing?
5671360	5672360	I really like that.
5672360	5673360	I don't know.
5673360	5674360	I like that.
5674360	5675360	Yeah.
5675360	5676360	I like that a lot.
5676360	5677360	My joke?
5677360	5679360	No, not your joke.
5679360	5682360	I don't like anything about you.
5682360	5683360	Whoa.
5683360	5686360	Is it weird for you guys to see yourself on screen
5686360	5691360	and talk about the period where you guys weren't talking?
5691360	5692360	No.
5692360	5696360	Not for me, because I feel vindicated.
5696360	5700360	The story is about some thing called the Sarah Silverman show.
5700360	5701360	What?
5701360	5705360	Six episodes?
5705360	5709360	I regret asking that question.
5709360	5711360	Obviously...
5711360	5712360	Come on.
5712360	5715360	You measure a man by his...
5715360	5719360	How many documentaries are made after him?
5719360	5721360	So, Hitler's the greatest man of all time.
5721360	5723360	Yeah.
5723360	5726360	And the Beatles.
5726360	5729360	No, I mean, I...
5729360	5731360	When Schwab and I...
5731360	5735360	Like, when Sarah fired me, I...
5735360	5736360	It was probably like...
5736360	5739360	At that point, not probably, it was the worst...
5739360	5741360	It was like my worst nightmare scenario.
5741360	5743360	I remember being so angry,
5743360	5746360	and I knew I had nowhere to put the anger.
5746360	5748360	I had no...
5748360	5752360	I would tell people, like, the people that I dated,
5752360	5754360	you know, in whom I would confide, I would be like,
5754360	5757360	I'm telling you this thing that is making me very upset,
5757360	5760360	and I know that I don't have any right.
5760360	5762360	I can't tell anyone about this.
5762360	5765360	I can't tell anyone how angry I am about this,
5765360	5768360	because I will sound like the most petty piece of shit in the world.
5768360	5778360	And I can't admit to myself that I wish Rob Schwab less luck
5778360	5780360	than he deserves.
5780360	5781360	I can't tell him...
5781360	5784360	I can't express the fact that I wish
5784360	5788360	that the Sarah Silverman program would fail without me.
5788360	5792360	You know, I have these petty, golem-like thoughts
5792360	5795360	about my precious, and I can't express them.
5795360	5797360	And then that makes it worse and worse,
5797360	5799360	and it festers and all that stuff.
5799360	5801360	And so it was a year of...
5801360	5803360	Because I couldn't express those things,
5803360	5805360	because I knew they were unhealthy,
5805360	5809360	like Rob and I didn't talk to each other for, like, a year at all.
5809360	5811360	And then this guy, Mike Ash, died.
5811360	5816360	Comedy, Channel 101, Mike Ash.
5816360	5821360	He was an old-timer who did a bunch of Channel 101 stuff,
5821360	5825360	and he died, and it was at his memorial service.
5825360	5829360	Rob and I started to talk again, and it was...
5829360	5832360	Yeah, I don't know. Whatever.
5832360	5834360	I'm over it.
5834360	5836360	When I watch that stuff, I'm like,
5836360	5838360	Oh, that's cute.
5838360	5840360	Obviously, I'm insane.
5840360	5842360	So...
5842360	5845360	So, RJ, there was this movie that I was playing earlier.
5845360	5849360	Yeah.
5849360	5852360	It was about these guys, and it was great.
5852360	5853360	It was a lot of fun.
5853360	5856360	Can you talk to your friends and ask them, like, 4.8?
5856360	5857360	I mean...
5857360	5859360	Wait, but I was gonna say something.
5859360	5860360	Boy.
5860360	5861360	No. Okay.
5861360	5862360	No.
5862360	5863360	No, not you.
5863360	5864360	Me?
5864360	5866360	Yeah. You were gonna say something.
5866360	5868360	Yes.
5868360	5869360	Great.
5869360	5870360	See?
5874360	5876360	I agree with Dan, yeah.
5876360	5877360	Tough times.
5877360	5879360	Everything's okay now.
5879360	5881360	Yeah, I mean...
5881360	5882360	Great.
5882360	5885360	I mean, like...
5885360	5887360	I wasn't...
5887360	5890360	The one thing that I wish I would have said at the time
5890360	5894360	while we were doing the interview is that I stayed.
5894360	5897360	I knew it was the right thing to do for me,
5897360	5901360	but I was not proud of that decision at all.
5901360	5905360	Like, it was a decision that I really wish I didn't have to do.
5905360	5906360	Yeah.
5906360	5908360	I don't think anybody says...
5908360	5910360	I don't think he made the wrong decision
5910360	5912360	because it's very hard to get...
5912360	5913360	No, I would tell people...
5913360	5915360	That's the other thing I would tell people is, like,
5915360	5918360	the crazy thing is, if Rob hadn't stayed,
5918360	5920360	it would be more of a mindfuck.
5920360	5921360	Right.
5921360	5923360	Because as I told Rob, when Sarah fired me,
5923360	5924360	I was like...
5924360	5928360	Because Rob had already been riding my trail of tears.
5928360	5930360	Is that an appropriate metaphor?
5930360	5931360	What is that?
5931360	5935360	Rob had already been, like, on that journey with me
5935360	5937360	a couple times, and I was like,
5937360	5938360	look, I get it.
5938360	5940360	Like, obviously, this is pathological for me.
5940360	5943360	I don't expect you to keep doing this.
5943360	5945360	What if Rob had quit out of loyalty?
5945360	5947360	What if Sarah Silverman fired me
5947360	5951360	from a basic cable comedy show and Rob had gone,
5951360	5953360	well, you know...
5953360	5955360	Friendship is friendship.
5955360	5957360	Let's just do it.
5957360	5958360	Then I would be fine.
5958360	5960360	I almost did.
5960360	5962360	I was really tempted to, you know.
5962360	5967360	But I never...
5967360	5969360	I wanted to see if I could do it alone.
5969360	5973360	I mean, like, when you're writing,
5973360	5976360	or any kind of partnership, you're always like,
5976360	5978360	well, who's pulling the weight?
5978360	5980360	You know, who's really the smart guy?
5980360	5983360	Who's really the guy that's just hanging along?
5983360	5986360	And I wanted to see if I could even exist alone.
5986360	5989360	I, for the longest time, didn't think I could do anything
5989360	5992360	by myself, even the comic book.
5992360	5998360	So this is really a difficult decision,
5998360	6001360	but I really think I need to do this.
6001360	6002360	Of course.
6002360	6003360	Yeah.
6003360	6005360	If you get fired in the midst of that, it's like,
6005360	6006360	holy shit.
6006360	6008360	Like, now I really have to ask that question
6008360	6009360	and answer it.
6009360	6010360	And it worked out fine.
6010360	6012360	It worked out great for both of us.
6012360	6016360	Now we're both 53, and we don't do shit about anything.
6017360	6018360	Okay.
6022360	6025360	We should probably take off.
6025360	6029360	I mean, you have your losing money being up here.
6029360	6030360	Yeah.
6030360	6031360	RJ.
6031360	6033360	No, RJ will be compensated.
6033360	6034360	Yes.
6034360	6038360	But we should put a ribbon on the show for these people.
6038360	6040360	These people are losing money.
6040360	6045360	They have shows to develop tomorrow.
6045360	6048360	Wayne White is like, will he notice if I leave?
6048360	6052360	Let's, usually we end the show.
6052360	6054360	We're not going to play Dungeons and Dragons?
6054360	6056360	I mean, I don't know how to do it
6056360	6058360	because we're sitting in director's chairs
6058360	6059360	and we don't have the equipment.
6059360	6061360	Yeah, I was being kidding.
6064360	6066360	I was being kidding.
6066360	6068360	But the show has an addiction to Dungeons and Dragons
6068360	6071360	as a show closer, so I don't know how to close the show, really.
6071360	6073360	So usually at the show, RJ,
6073360	6075360	we play Dungeons and Dragons at the end.
6075360	6077360	He gets it.
6077360	6080360	You don't make any chance to know how to beatbox, do you, RJ?
6080360	6082360	Because I can rap.
6084360	6085360	He does.
6085360	6086360	No, he does.
6086360	6087360	I can see it.
6087360	6088360	You know, it seems like...
6088360	6090360	If I knew I'd suck at it.
6090360	6091360	Oh, so I thought you were...
6091360	6093360	Let's hear your worst beatbox.
6093360	6095360	And I'll do mine just so you don't feel bad.
6095360	6100360	Like, what if I started so you could drift it on the back?
6100360	6101360	Crap.
6103360	6104360	Crap.
6104360	6105360	Crap.
6105360	6106360	You blame me.
6106360	6107360	Crap.
6107360	6108360	Crap.
6108360	6109360	Crap.
6109360	6110360	Crap.
6110360	6111360	Crap.
6111360	6112360	Crap.
6112360	6113360	Crap.
6113360	6114360	Crap.
6114360	6115360	Crap.
6115360	6116360	Crap.
6116360	6117360	Crap.
6117360	6118360	Crap.
6118360	6119360	Crap.
6119360	6120360	Crap.
6120360	6121360	Crap.
6121360	6122360	Crap.
6122360	6122360	
6122360	6123360	You stopped.
6123360	6124360	No.
6124360	6127360	Yeah, no, that was amazing, everyone was like, Holy shit.
6127360	6128360	Holy shit.
6128360	6129360	This has happened to it.
6129360	6130360	Satan gives you a mind.
6130360	6131360	All right.
6131360	6132360	All right.
6132360	6134680	Now we fucked that up.
6134680	6135680	That was great beatboxing.
6135680	6139360	Because then if I could have just rhymed milk with silk, we could have been out of here.
6139360	6140360	We would have been done.
6140360	6143080	So Spencer, why don't you beatbox and then you rhyme milk with silk?
6143080	6144080	Oh, I can't beatbox.
6144080	6145080	I was lying.
6145080	6147360	Rob, can you beatbox?
6147360	6148360	No.
6148360	6149360	No.
