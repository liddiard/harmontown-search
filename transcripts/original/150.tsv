0	7000	Well I know that love lies, well they surprise, but you do the strange, keep changing
7000	10000	Hey lover, good evening
12000	14000	How are you?
14000	17000	You said you'd like to live in the romance
17000	19000	Thank you, thank you, thank you
22000	27000	And welcome to the Nerds Melt showroom
31000	34000	My name is Curtis Armstrong
36000	43000	And I am, just for one night, your temporary cult-troller
48000	55000	And please give a big Harman Town welcome to our mayor
55000	59000	His honor himself, Dan Harman
60000	62000	Yes, yes, yes
62000	64000	Nobody yes, yes
64000	66000	Thank you
66000	69000	guest cult-troller Curtis Armstrong
76000	78000	He wasn't mad at me
78000	79000	I remember when I was-
79000	85000	We really have to talk about that because I actually heard about that from like other sources
86000	89000	Somebody stopped me on the street
89000	91000	In London?
91000	94000	No, here, he was here, after I came back here
94000	101000	Leah, who's not here, but usually is here, said you have to talk to Dan because he's upset
101000	104000	and he thinks that you don't like him anymore
104000	106000	This is my worst nightmare
106000	110000	But I thought I'd been really clear, I just was going to be gone for a few weeks
110000	113000	I really like you
113000	115000	All right
117000	118000	All right
118000	120000	I don't, I don't want to stop
120000	124000	Now that you had to tell me that, are you sure you now don't like me?
124000	128000	No, no, no, now I'm more sure than ever because I've actually been thinking about it
128000	129000	Oh, okay
129000	132000	And because what happened was, she stopped me, it made me think
132000	134000	Do I really like him?
135000	137000	It was a good opportunity to check in
137000	139000	So for a few days I had that to mull over
139000	143000	And then I'm, you know, coming in and I can assure you I do
143000	144000	Oh, that's fantastic
144000	147000	This is actually, okay, that was my worst nightmare because I didn't want to be high maintenance
147000	152000	But now this is my biggest dream, which is perfectly conditional love
153000	154000	Pretty much, yes
154000	158000	As a child, if you receive anything less than unconditional love
158000	161000	And really, let's face it, who got unconditional love in their home?
161000	164000	Probably Dave Klein, who's here again tonight
164000	166000	I think maybe he got unconditional love
166000	167000	Because he seemed to...
171000	173000	That was a very demure yuk
174000	177000	It was filled with maternal love
178000	181000	But yeah, no, not the case in my home
181000	187000	I mean, you definitely knew if you had behaved in a way that made you deserving of love
187000	189000	Or as I like to call it, not getting hit
189000	195000	And so, you know, I think that drives me very much creatively
195000	198000	Probably also complicates a lot of my relationships
198000	203000	So it actually sent a tingle up my spine when you said that combination
203000	206000	You said, it made me think, do I really like him?
206000	211000	And I was like, yes, this is the dark circle that I have to dance on the rim of
212000	215000	And then jackpot, I earned it, I earned it
217000	220000	Normal people are just like, well, of course he likes me, I'm a perfectly fine person
220000	222000	And if he doesn't, why would I care?
222000	223000	Not me
224000	225000	Not me
226000	228000	Well, how was your trip? How was your daughter?
228000	230000	My daughter's wonderful
230000	236000	And she's actually working the big festival that's going on as we speak
237000	241000	Called Field Day with lots of bands
241000	244000	And she's doing that, she's done with school, she loves school
244000	249000	And I spent 10 days with her without break, it was wonderful
250000	253000	I mean, you know, I thought about you from time to time
256000	259000	But it was great, thank you for asking
259000	262000	All right, awesome, can you guys see okay? You're here, all right, okay
262000	264000	There's Seth, the hitchhiker
265000	268000	See, it's a little less hitchhiking what you're doing at this point
268000	269000	You're just sort of orbiting the show
269000	271000	Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow
271000	273000	Okay, all right, well we're not yelling at you
274000	277000	Usually hitchhikers travel in a line
277000	279000	Whereas you've been kind of circling
279000	282000	But that's, hey look, that's better than what I'm doing
282000	285000	Which is, I'm just, I'm just jerking off
287000	289000	Not right now
289000	292000	That would be amazing if you could do it with no hands
294000	297000	All right, so, okay, so I just want to, let's talk about our art
297000	299000	This is our art segment
299000	301000	We've got music for the art segment
304000	319000	So, I mean, I, so, I have this ongoing, like, I don't know, what do you call it, like a feud, or a, it's a, it's a, it's a B in Aaron's bonnet
319000	322000	My lovely wife, Erin McGathey, who's also not here with us, she's spending time with the dogs
322000	324000	Because we were working with her
324000	332000	So, I was, I, I mean, I, so, I have this ongoing, like, I don't know, what do you call it, like a feud, or a, it's a, it's a, it's a B in Erin's bonnet
332000	335000	We spent time with the dogs because we were away from them all weekend
335000	338000	And Jeff is, Jeff is just sick
338000	343000	But, so, Erin, like, I don't know, she's an artist
343000	345000	She's more, she's a visual person
345000	347000	She sees colors and things
347000	350000	And I always, I'm always just like, I think colors are dumb
350000	355000	You know, like, I, I, they're, they seem pretty pointless
355000	359000	I think the point of them originally was that, you know, we're primates
359000	362000	So we needed to recognize if an apple was gonna kill us if we ate it
362000	365000	But now we have, we have, we have genetic engineering
365000	367000	And, you know, all apples are fine
367000	370000	They're, they're injected with, with conservatives
370000	372000	Yeah, it's like, we've, we've finished it
372000	375000	We've taken God's place
375000	380000	And, so why not, why not just lower the, the bit value of the, of the graphics in the universe
380000	384000	We could probably expand our, our RAM, or our CPU
384000	386000	If, if, if things were just black and white
386000	389000	Imagine how much more earth there could be, possibly
389000	391000	I, I, I know that, I know that's not how the universe works
391000	396000	But I'm just saying, like, maybe our brains could process more if we were, if we just didn't see color
396000	398000	I, I, or like, how about eight colors
398000	400000	Because that's the only ones we can name, really
400000	403000	And then people say, oh, eggshell instead of white
403000	405000	And it's like, that's white, that's dumb
405000	406000	To me, it's dumb
406000	410000	But, so, so, Erin was always like, she, she, she, she showed me this magazine
410000	413000	And she had this kind of smirk on her face
413000	416000	And she shows me this, like, grid thing
416000	419000	It's like, it's this thing with, like, a thousand lines in it
419000	423000	And, and she's like, how many, how many colors do you see here
423000	427000	I'm like, I don't know, like, like, the usual eight dumb colors
427000	430000	And she's like, she's like, yeah, you know
430000	433000	I'm a tetra, haka magaba
433000	438000	Like, there's some, she's, she's got more cones or rods or something in her eye
438000	440000	She's a tetra, tetra chromat
440000	442000	Tetra chromat?
443000	446000	Where, where are my tetra chromat?
448000	452000	She's immensely proud of this, which I would equate to being proud of your race
452000	454000	Which is bad
456000	459000	It seems like a vile quality in a person
459000	465000	They're like, what is the difference between that and saying, like, you know, I have very little melanin in my skin
467000	469000	I'm, I'm like a snowbank
470000	473000	Oh, so you're, you're, okay, great, you're racist
473000	480000	So, so, so, so, but she's like smirking because she can see, like, like, I don't know, more of them than I can
480000	484000	She's enough that you can, but I'm like, wait, how many can you see?
484000	487000	She's like 20 or 30 or something, whatever the number is, 38
487000	492000	And as I'm like, well, are you talking about all the different shades of the colors?
492000	495000	And she's like, yeah, well, how many shades do you see?
495000	501000	And I'm like, are we really talking about each individual shade, each striation that you can see on this thing?
501000	505000	And she's like, yeah, and I'm like, well, I mean, that's ridiculous
505000	508000	But 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 30, 14, 15, 16, 17
508000	510000	And she's like, shut up, stop it, you're lying
510000	515000	And I'm like, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 30, 33, 33, I guess
515000	518000	I mean, there's probably a couple more, but I'll, I'll, I'll lowball it
518000	520000	And she's like, fuck you, you're lying
522000	524000	And I'm like, no, I'm not, colors are dumb
526000	529000	I got, I got, I got, I got more cones
529000	532000	2, I'm a tetracycline
533000	535000	But I just, I just, I just throw them away
535000	537000	They just go into my eye and I just go
538000	540000	Because they're dumb, you don't need them
543000	544000	Who needs, who needs more colors?
544000	548000	You know, you know, who had more colors in grade school? The rich kids
550000	553000	Going by Crayola metrics, those were rich kids
553000	556000	They also had a sharpener built into the front of the box
557000	560000	Little, little, little, little born rich parasites
561000	562000	His dads didn't hit him
563000	568000	I had to earn every fucking crayon in my shitty little stepped on box
569000	573000	Broken chunks of like, just like caveman pigment
574000	578000	I had to, I had to go out and dig up clay and ochre
579000	585000	And like, make red, because my parents were like, why do you, there's red out there, go get it in the yard
588000	591000	There's red on your pillowcase, yeah, because you guys don't give me enough water
594000	596000	I got a lot of nosebleeds when I was a kid
596000	599000	I thought I was an alien abductee, do you believe in alien abduction?
599000	603000	I do, I do, I do, yeah, I think that's a real possibility
603000	604000	Huh, yeah
607000	608000	I'm assuming you don't
608000	613000	I did when I was a kid, I was like, I think that's a thing that you'd gravitate to when you're a kid
613000	615000	Because it's a real...
615000	616000	It explains a lot
616000	620000	Well, yeah, it helps you cope, I think, you know, the fantasy that you're special
620000	621000	Still does
621000	623000	That the world is hard for you for a reason
623000	629000	Maybe like, these people are coming and getting you and then they're like, you know, milking your prostate and
630000	633000	telling you secrets about the environment
633000	635000	You're destroying it
636000	643000	We know things that you can only find out from cow anuses and like, go back to your world
643000	647000	But we're gonna keep coming back and giving you nosebleeds and you're so special
648000	652000	I'm still waiting for you to explain why none of this makes sense
652000	654000	It still does, I'm not like
654000	657000	When you grow up, why do you not believe in that anymore?
657000	662000	I think I started to, well, I started to learn about things like sleep paralysis
662000	666000	Which there's this, I don't know if it's a good documentary, Aaron and I just watched it tonight
666000	672000	The guys that made the documentary about The Shining, Room 237
672000	674000	Am I getting that right?
674000	677000	That's a really interesting documentary that everybody should watch
677000	680000	This one's also very interesting
680000	683000	I hesitate to use the words good documentary because I don't know if it's
683000	688000	It's just a bunch of people talking about their sleep paralysis experiences
688000	692000	It's very interesting, but maybe that's different from a good documentary
692000	695000	Shut up, Dan, just shut up
695000	697000	Alright, now start talking
697000	700000	First check to see if everyone likes you
706000	708000	Sarcasm
708000	712000	I can tell when it's fake, I can always tell when it's fake
713000	717000	So the, god damn it, sleep paralysis, you know what I'm talking about
717000	718000	Have you ever had that?
718000	719000	No
719000	720000	Really?
720000	721000	Oh, it's terrifying
721000	722000	I've had it
722000	725000	How many people have had sleep paralysis experiences?
725000	726000	Really?
726000	727000	It's a very common thing
727000	733000	It's actually, the odd thing is, it's very common for it to happen very rarely to everybody
733000	739000	It's very uncommon for it to happen all the time to a few people
739000	742000	Some people have it every night
742000	746000	And they're living in a sort of strange hellscape
746000	749000	Where they have no choice but to make friends with the shadow people
749000	751000	And give them names and stuff
751000	753000	I go, that's the one with the hat
753000	756000	By the way, hats aren't scary by the way
756000	758000	They show the shadow people
758000	762000	One of the symptoms of sleep paralysis, one of the things that happens is the intruder
762000	763000	This happened to me
763000	764000	This is a terrifying thing
764000	767000	Sometimes a lot of people talk about things on their chest
768000	770000	Just in case anybody doesn't know what this is
770000	777000	I mean, the scientific theory is that when you go into REM sleep, which is when you're going to start dreaming
777000	785000	The scientific explanation for this is that your body releases a, or your brain releases a chemical to your body
785000	791000	Or something that keeps it from moving whenever you'd want to move it
791000	796000	Like when you're reaching for a big cookie in your dream, so you don't gouge your wife's eyes out
797000	801000	So it's a natural part of REM sleep supposedly
801000	806000	Your body is supposed to not move and cannot move chemically
806000	810000	However, you're always supposed to be unconscious and sleeping when that's happening
810000	814000	And sleep paralysis is when either while waking up or going to sleep
814000	816000	You're not doing it the same
816000	821000	There's an overlap where you are awake and your body is completely paralyzed
821000	824000	And then your middle brain starts to panic
824000	827000	And then these things, these very common things that happen
827000	834000	Like people see things on their chest that are like, you know, demonic kind of iconography that happens
834000	839000	And like one of the most common things is just this shadowy figure in the room walking toward you
839000	844000	And it happened, and there's like these archetypes like the shadow, the little shadow man
844000	847000	But then the guy with the hat, which is again, not scary
848000	851000	It's like a hat, it looks like a pizza logo
851000	853000	It looks like Rocky Rococo
853000	858000	And then there's an evil hag, which I think, because I saw like a cloaked figure
858000	862000	I was like 20 years old, I was sleeping at my parents' house
862000	865000	Probably like laundry or something, doing laundry for the weekend
865000	867000	And I was crashing in my old bedroom
867000	871000	And this happened to me and I woke up and I couldn't move
871000	874000	And this, I mean, it's so real
874000	879000	There was a cloaked black figure in the corner of my bedroom
880000	883000	That just strode confidently toward me
883000	885000	I could hear every footfall on the carpet
885000	888000	It was like, it was really, really there
888000	890000	It wasn't a visual hallucination
890000	895000	It was like I was sensing all of it, the proximity, the sound of its footsteps
895000	901000	And this like image of I think a female figure kind of cloaked and permanently in shadow
901000	904000	Just marching across the room toward me
904000	908000	Which is just, you know, sometimes you see a coat rack in the dark
908000	911000	And you're like, holy shit, oh god, that scared me for a second
911000	914000	But this is a person in the room that is like there
914000	916000	It's not like, oh, that looks like something
916000	917000	It's there
917000	921000	And it just like marched across the room and just kept coming at me
921000	925000	And then as soon as it, it was as if it just wanted to do just that
925000	927000	Just wanted to put its face in my face
927000	930000	And which is like, that's even scarier because you're like
930000	932000	Why would you want to just scare a person?
932000	934000	Because you're crazy
935000	940000	And then as soon as the face got close enough to touch my neck
940000	942000	I finally was able to
942000	944000	Because the whole time you're trying to scream and you can't
944000	947000	And then I finally went, Mom!
947000	949000	And I was 20
949000	952000	And I like bolted up and then I just sat there
952000	954000	And I was like catching my breath and the adrenaline
954000	956000	As I'm realizing this was all, this was not real
956000	958000	But I just shouted out, Mom
958000	960000	And then I just kept waiting
960000	962000	And I thought about saying, I'm okay
962000	965000	But then I was like, let's see what happens
965000	967000	Never nothing
967000	969000	And I just went back to sleep
969000	973000	And I've had a couple of experiences that fit in the same category
973000	978000	But that was the legit textbook to sleep paralysis
978000	979000	It's never happened to you
979000	981000	Never, absolutely not
981000	983000	And did it ever happen after that to you?
983000	986000	Yeah, I've had a couple weird related kind of things
986000	987000	But not like that
987000	989000	Nothing that was really terrifying
989000	991000	I've had just generic
991000	994000	I wake up and I can't move my body and I panic
994000	997000	And then I'm suddenly able to move it
997000	1001000	But not with the goo-gods coming at me
1001000	1004000	And I've also had weird
1004000	1010000	I would have these things in my mid-20s where
1010000	1013000	It's like my
1013000	1015000	All of a sudden I'm sleeping and then I'm awake
1015000	1017000	But I can't move
1017000	1021000	And then my whole self
1021000	1023000	But my body's still in the bed
1023000	1026000	My whole self starts getting thrown around the room
1026000	1028000	Banged up against the walls
1028000	1036000	Like somebody's trying to pull my soul out of my apartment
1036000	1038000	But can't
1038000	1041000	For some reason it can only move it around in the room
1041000	1044000	So it's just banging into every wall and ceiling
1044000	1046000	And I can kind of see that I'm still in bed
1046000	1050000	And then finally, at a certain point, manages to get out
1050000	1052000	And I shoot up into the sky
1052000	1055000	At the speed of sound, I'm assuming
1055000	1058000	And it's actually kind of cool
1058000	1060000	I'm like, holy shit, I can fly
1060000	1061000	This is going to be amazing
1061000	1064000	I'm going to be this new kind of hero
1064000	1065000	I can do this at night
1065000	1068000	And I'm assuming I won't be able to get shot or stabbed
1068000	1071000	So I could probably fight crime or at least discourage it
1071000	1074000	And it's just this elated feeling
1074000	1076000	Holy shit, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
1076000	1081000	And then it just gives way as the physics of it start to kick in
1081000	1082000	Where you're like, I'm not flying
1082000	1084000	I've been rocketed upward
1084000	1085000	I can't fly
1085000	1088000	I'm just really high up in the sky
1088000	1090000	And you feel the momentum stop
1090000	1092000	And then you're like, now I'm going to fall
1092000	1096000	And it just turns into one of those falling nightmares
1096000	1097000	And then you wake up
1097000	1098000	So anyways
1098000	1100000	Wow
1100000	1103000	I would actually have told that one first
1103000	1108000	I mean, that's a lot more dramatic than the woman walking towards you
1108000	1110000	Well, noted
1110000	1113000	Alright
1113000	1115000	That's good, that's conditional love
1115000	1117000	Keep letting me know when I fuck up
1117000	1118000	Well, they were both good stories though
1118000	1119000	Thank you
1119000	1120000	They were both good stories
1120000	1121000	Yeah, well
1124000	1127000	What are your dreams about, like a gumdrop tree? Fuck you
1127000	1133000	I had unconditional love
1133000	1135000	See, you're just like a
1135000	1137000	You dream like we assume dogs do
1137000	1140000	You're just like chasing a rabbit
1140000	1142000	And then while you're sleeping you're like
1144000	1146000	And your wife's like, oh, he's dreaming
1146000	1148000	He's so cute
1148000	1151000	I am cute when I do that
1151000	1154000	Did you ever see the YouTube video of the dog that's dreaming
1154000	1157000	And it's doing like, it's like running on its side
1157000	1159000	And it's like, and then it's like, it's running
1159000	1163000	And then it starts to like, starts to run really fast
1163000	1165000	And then it like looks behind it
1165000	1167000	Like it's, and it's snarling
1167000	1169000	Like it's clearly being chased by something it doesn't like
1169000	1175000	And then it kind of, it gets up and runs full speed into a wall right next to it
1175000	1178000	And then wakes up
1178000	1181000	And then it just kind of like sits there like, yeah
1182000	1187000	I mean, who do you talk to when you're a dog when that happens to you
1187000	1190000	You got nobody you can go to with that
1192000	1194000	All right, so colors are dumb
1198000	1200000	You know
1200000	1202000	I'll save that for when Spencer's out here
1203000	1204000	All right
1204000	1206000	Okay, well let's meet a new friend, shall we?
1206000	1207000	Sure
1207000	1212000	I invited somebody, you know, somebody that I've been interacting with throughout my career
1212000	1213000	From time to time
1213000	1216000	You know, we're not, we don't hang out ever
1216000	1219000	I think we're like Commissioner Gortons to each other
1219000	1222000	Neither of us is Batman, but we're
1222000	1226000	I'm just using that to illustrate distance and respect
1230000	1234000	Begrudging functional vigilante respect
1234000	1237000	The system has failed us both
1237000	1239000	And there we are
1239000	1243000	This is the funniest moment in the good Batman movie
1243000	1245000	The middle Christian Bale one
1245000	1247000	The Heath Ledger one
1248000	1252000	I always laugh when Commissioner Gortons goes into the bank vault
1252000	1254000	And it's like fluorescent lit
1254000	1257000	And then he's like, oh no, the money's marked or whatever
1257000	1262000	And then he turns, it's like one of the cops turns and Batman's just hanging out
1263000	1264000	It looks so funny
1264000	1265000	He's like not supposed to
1265000	1267000	I know he does that all the time because he's like a detective
1267000	1271000	But like it's just weird that he would be like, hey, I'm here
1271000	1273000	Like he had to get into that room
1273000	1277000	And it's like usually Batman comes in through like little, little windows and things
1277000	1278000	And it's usually nighttime
1278000	1280000	And this is like just noon and it's like
1280000	1282000	There's like fluorescent lights
1282000	1284000	And it's just funny
1284000	1289000	It's also funny to cut from someone looking and then just a hard cut to Batman
1290000	1294000	He just looks like, he just looks like the biggest nerd in that moment
1294000	1297000	There's no way for that to look cool
1299000	1303000	Because we've seen people under fluorescent light dressed as Batman
1303000	1305000	And we've never gone like ooh
1306000	1310000	We've always just at best will go like
1310000	1312000	Hey, can I get a picture man? You look really awesome
1316000	1318000	It's a single gunshot from the back
1319000	1326000	No note
1326000	1330000	But a brief check of his closet at home tells us the whole story
1330000	1334000	All right, yeah, sorry, I was introducing this guy
1334000	1337000	Apparently this guy needs no introduction
1337000	1344000	He's really, what he is is he's the editor of TV Guide magazine
1344000	1345000	But because the world is changing
1345000	1348000	One of the cruel tricks of fate is that he has a new title
1348000	1350000	Which is just not as sexy
1350000	1355000	He is still just as important but he is now called the chief content officer
1359000	1360000	Poor guy
1360000	1363000	But he's awesome and he's a sort of, I don't know
1363000	1365000	He's my TV talking buddy
1365000	1367000	It's Mike Schneider
1373000	1375000	So get up, get down
1375000	1377000	I came to rock and fire you again
1378000	1379000	We got love
1381000	1383000	I think they like it when you sit there
1383000	1384000	Sounds good
1384000	1385000	That's your mic
1385000	1387000	I know, it's a sit
1387000	1389000	So we're talking about dreams, right?
1389000	1393000	So I had a really bizarre, like you guys have these dreams that are so vivid
1393000	1396000	That you wake up the next day and you're still not quite sure if it was real or not
1396000	1397000	If it really happened or not
1397000	1403000	Yeah, like when you're in your early 20s and like I always have those dreams where you'd find a $50
1404000	1406000	And it's like you really need 50 bucks
1406000	1409000	It's like a lot of ramen noodles and pot and stuff
1409000	1417000	And you're like, it's like such a low stakes dream that you're like three hours into your shower
1417000	1419000	What about the three hour shower?
1420000	1425000	Three hours into your day when you suddenly realize you don't have 50 extra dollars
1425000	1426000	So sad
1426000	1427000	The biggest let down of the day
1427000	1435000	So I had this really weird dream last night and maybe amateur psychologist, dream catcher, Dan Harmon can help me with this
1435000	1439000	So in my dream, I'm suddenly a contestant on Jeopardy
1439000	1445000	But for some reason they've sold like the branding rights to Dunkin Donuts
1445000	1453000	So there's a new Jeopardy set literally right behind Trebek is a functioning Dunkin Donuts branch
1453000	1455000	Where they're actually selling donuts on the set
1455000	1456000	During the game show?
1456000	1457000	During the game show
1457000	1463000	They're in the background like selling donuts and Trebek is standing up there and Trebek doesn't give a fuck anymore
1463000	1465000	Trebek is like I'm done with this
1465000	1470000	So the episode is going on and it's me and two other contestants and he's talking to us
1470000	1474000	He's asking us about ourselves, but he never gets around to actually asking any questions
1474000	1479000	So halfway through the show suddenly people in the audience start screaming out Trebek ask a question
1479000	1484000	And he just sort of glares at them and goes back and he starts asking me again about you know
1484000	1488000	What I do for a living and it still says zero underneath me
1488000	1491000	And meanwhile they're making donuts in the background
1491000	1493000	I'm actually thinking that donut looks pretty good
1493000	1494000	All right
1494000	1501000	So corporate America has changed the media scape to a point where although you're a nice guy and feel fulfilled and know who you are
1501000	1505000	You the clock is running out on your life and you're not achieving anything
1505000	1506000	That's pretty good
1511000	1516000	So literally today I go and I run into my brother-in-law and the first thing he says out of his mouth is
1516000	1519000	Hey, they're opening a new Dunkin Donuts and Encino
1519000	1520000	What?
1520000	1526000	You were I don't know what that meant, but like the first thing like today
1526000	1529000	It's following me. It's that's weird. It's bizarre
1529000	1533000	I mean, I know it's Dunkin Donuts aren't rare, but that's definitely weird
1533000	1536000	I haven't heard the word Dunkin Donuts all week
1536000	1540000	If I had if I had if I dreamt about a Dunkin Donuts and someone mentioned it
1540000	1545000	That would be I would consider that notable I have notable evidence of paranormal activity
1545000	1550000	The very first thing I brought up on your podcast right now was my Dunkin Donuts dream for some strange reason
1550000	1555000	Well, there was the yeah, there was there was one story of the sleep paralysis thing where the guy was talking
1555000	1560000	I like he told a story about how there was like a demon standing over him and telling him you're gonna die
1560000	1562000	I'm a demon and then
1564000	1568000	But then his girlfriend said he should that said demon on it. Yeah, yeah
1571000	1574000	Demon with with with two D's for a double dose of this
1575000	1577000	Damon
1579000	1585000	The his girlfriend sat up screaming and she was having a night terror and in her nightmare
1586000	1588000	There was a cat sitting on her chest
1589000	1591000	Speaking in gibberish to her boyfriend
1592000	1598000	At the same time but the cat was a giant black cat and a lot of people report that like it's I think it's just
1598000	1604000	An explanation for like this giant your mind is trying to put an object on something that makes no sense
1605000	1607600	So it's and a lot of people make it a big black cat
1607920	1612760	Her big black cat had red eyes and so did this this demon at that point in the documentary
1612760	1618580	I said, I don't I don't know if I believe that and Aaron said why and it's like well because that's like kind of like
1619080	1622320	confirmed proof of supernatural activity like I I
1623000	1628720	I'm not I'm not a I'm not a like a I'm not like a cynical skeptic about things for no reason
1628720	1632360	But I then again, I take it very seriously if somebody asserts, you know
1632360	1638600	Like Jeff does that he predicted 9-11 when his dream, you know, it's like I just get really quiet and wait for Kumail to you
1638600	1643720	Know start point point point making fun of him. He did that and I predicted the Dunkin Donuts and Encino
1643720	1646840	So it's kind of but that's that's that's right on the bubble
1646840	1650320	I mean, that's that's like intriguing to me because it's I think I feel like that's possible
1650320	1653560	I don't it's too coincidental that she's dreaming of a black cat with red eyes
1653560	1657200	There's a demon with red eyes and like that. I don't know. It's like I feel like someone's lying
1657200	1660000	But I mean, what do you what do you make of this paranormal?
1660960	1663040	Shenanigans, well, I mean I like I just I
1663440	1669200	What's strange about that one is that those two events were happening supposedly at the exact same time, which is very weird
1669200	1672920	Aaron said well, this guy has this thing happen to him every night in one form or another
1673000	1678760	So it's only a matter of well, then it would make sense that she was having nightmares like that because if this happens to him
1678760	1681120	All the time, that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah
1681320	1687560	Have you heard the stories of the people who actually can't fall asleep and after a couple of weeks of not sleeping?
1687560	1692160	They start to actually hallucinate the things that they're dreaming. They're actually dreaming, but they're awake
1692160	1694160	I've so I've been in that state
1694400	1696560	Yeah, yeah toward the end of every season
1696560	1700600	Yeah, like like like I were if I yeah, like I'll go a couple days without sleep
1700600	1706080	But there's a there's a sort of like delusional state that sets in which is actually really cool. Yeah, and
1706600	1711760	And you stop needing as much sleep like your body the same way
1711760	1715400	You know you've heard this and may probably experience it how like you
1715840	1720840	Your body suppresses illness if you're really bit like your body has this sense of like well
1720840	1725320	She needs to get her work done at the hospital or whatever for this week
1725320	1731320	This is a rough week and you can you feel like you're maybe gonna get sick or you've been exposed to all these colds and stuff
1731320	1733920	And you're not getting sick and you know, you're just like I guess I just don't get sick
1733920	1738720	And then the week ends and you just like collapse into mucus like because your body's like, yeah, fuck you
1738720	1740720	I was you were sick the whole time
1741560	1744280	But but so the same thing it works that way with sleep too
1744280	1747880	I think after a while after a certain amount of sleep deprivation kids try this
1749840	1751000	The
1751000	1755760	You can actually just like sleep for 20 minutes at a time and I don't and then just wait
1755760	1757880	Do you wake up and it's like you there's no way you got enough sleep
1757880	1762720	But your body is just now on the Atkins diet of sleep where it's like just give me a little nibble of ham
1763080	1767400	Just give me just give me something. I don't need this knickers bar. I don't I don't need to sleep for eight hours
1767400	1772760	But I get it. You're an asshole. Give me it. Give me a little berry from it from a bush so I can keep going
1773720	1775720	it's pretty cool because I
1775720	1781760	Like I would I will fall asleep while typing and then you wake up and then you read like this weird shit
1781760	1787520	I think you just and then like like I would like fall asleep in like right right writers rooms
1787520	1790800	And then like I'm kind of like half like I'm still asleep
1790800	1794280	But my eyes are open and I'm just saying something like I'll just start
1794760	1800600	So it'll be like well, what if what if Annie's jealous of Britta and so she does this and then I'll go yeah
1801360	1803360	What about minecraft?
1804560	1809840	Or something that else that's out of like from other part of my brain and everyone will get this weird look on their face
1809840	1811840	And I'll get embarrassed and I'll go take a nap in my office
1812680	1814680	Sounds healthy. Yeah
1814840	1816840	But it made the show so good
1821280	1823280	Again I can tell when it's lies
1825200	1830560	I look I know that's you guys saying hey, we enjoyed season six and thank you very much for saying that all over Twitter, too
1830560	1832560	I love thank you. Damn girl
1841680	1847360	No, please they're standing up in the back. Oh, no, don't everybody stand up. I thought that would I thought that might work. I
1848160	1852520	Thought if everyone thought of standing I was happening behind them. You could like start one from the back
1854520	1855840	Yeah
1855840	1860180	Not like the real standing. Oh, I got when I when I wrote those Oscars that Hugh Jackman hosted
1861080	1866280	Sean Penn just fucking leap to his feet. He was like yes best Oscars ever amazing
1866280	1868920	Oh, and then Ed Harris was like I agree. I don't care
1869920	1871920	Morgan Freeman was like yeah
1875960	1877960	So
1878280	1880840	So by the way National Treasure Curtis Armstrong
1881720	1886640	National Treasure Curtis Armstrong. Oh, I thought he wasn't in national treasure
1887800	1889800	That's Steve Zahn
1891440	1897040	That was very nice of you, thank you. No, he's I mean it's right. Yeah, don't get me started
1897040	1900760	That's the guy. Yes. Well, it's one of those guys one of those guys
1901840	1905420	The k-12, dude the k-12, dude
1905420	1907420	I
1909340	1914900	Get a lot of tweets from youngsters now that are watching better off dead because they because you became a friend of the show
1914900	1916420	I could tell that they'd never seen it
1916420	1922180	Which I'm exceptionally proud of because that movie does hold up and is awesome and it's like nice to see somebody go like holy shit
1922180	1928620	I just rented this I would never would have and it's so amazing. I know I really like seeing seeing those. That's really nice. Yeah
1930060	1932060	Shit, okay. So
1932060	1938740	We were gonna talk about TV TV, I assume but what with the yeah, don't yes everybody get lots of sleep
1941020	1948020	All right, well, yeah, let's talk about TV so so so so it's the Golden Age of television which which which which is
1948020	1953860	True because TV is higher quality than the than the movies because movies are big international business
1953860	1958780	So we're just churning out these like giant movies and like the weird cultural shit
1958980	1961860	You look at Disney and Warner Brothers in the majority of
1962260	1967460	It's the the big DC or Marvel franchises or what they're kind of focusing on or also some Pixar in the future
1967460	1971260	But really that's what the movies now are so yeah, and you're all the other stuff out
1971700	1976300	Instead of making like something that's about an insight into for instance like American
1977020	1983660	Domestic culture and then exporting it to other countries as television where they there could still be that cultural like
1983660	1986340	Oh, this is an American show. I know that going in
1986780	1992300	Like the movies are like the American audience is like a fraction of the box office that they even care about
1992820	2000180	Didn't they release the the new Avengers movie in China before here or it was it was it was like America was like the last
2000740	2002180	Yeah, and you know
2002180	2007660	What's interesting too is now there they're having to sort of there are certain things they won't do in some of these big movies now
2007660	2011200	Because China is such a large percentage of the box office
2011200	2011660	So yeah
2011660	2015900	And that's just and that's just the tip of the iceberg in terms of like the effective if you're if you're making a movie for
2015900	2022580	An entire planet and you need it to be this big crazy movie and obviously a byproduct of that
2022580	2027380	I mean one one one effect of that is that CG is gonna get really good and it really has and it's amazing
2027380	2030140	We can do anything now and to the point where I was watching Mad Max
2030140	2035260	I was I had no idea everyone that keeps watching walking out of Mad Max is always saying the same thing
2035260	2035700	They're all going
2035700	2038900	I don't know how they did that and I literally mean I don't know how they did that
2038900	2043180	I don't know if that was a practical car flipping through the air or maybe the tire was CG
2043220	2047540	But the car wasn't or weirdly I know something about that. All right
2048860	2053340	Which I usually don't but I happen to know something about that because of Genevieve
2053940	2056980	Pearson, okay, who you know. Yeah. Yeah Genevieve
2056980	2061940	We love Genevieve from King of the Nerds and she did some research on it every every
2063020	2064300	car
2064300	2066300	effect is
2066540	2067860	practical
2067860	2070140	They may have layered stuff over it
2070140	2076100	But all practice all of the car stuff is practical all there are other things that are siege is CGI
2076100	2081820	But a vast amount of that movie was actual practical and the guitar guy
2082260	2086140	And the guitar guy was a real guy. We love the guitar guy. I
2086860	2092940	Mean that was yeah, I mean that's a geez you would expect a movie like that to be it just doesn't look like it to me
2093420	2095420	Not a perfect place
2095420	2101940	But it doesn't look like a CGI movie to me and even at the parts where I know it has to be
2101980	2106540	It's really there are moments of that movie that I thought were just beautiful. Yeah
2107460	2112580	Camera is always just in the perfect position, which is where you which is an effect of the CG kind of
2113380	2115460	Mediascape shut up Harmon
2116500	2118720	Entourage on the other hand all CG
2119520	2121520	I
2121520	2132680	Don't know where I mean, I don't know where those three booze were coming from
2132680	2136840	Hey, I have never seen a frame of entourage and I'm fine. Oh
2138000	2140000	You got some binging to do
2140640	2141800	I
2141800	2146920	Told that to somebody they said actually they kind of things kind of studied me for a second and as they molded over in
2146920	2149360	Their head they said like I think you're hmm
2149360	2154240	I think you're experiencing entourage the right way like because it's like it's like trickling in
2154240	2159080	You know through the water table to you like like it's like, you know, you don't need to see any episodes
2159080	2164040	It's like it's more of a yeah, that's how I experienced the Real Housewives. It's it's I never actually watch him
2164040	2168960	I just kind of for whatever reason if you live in this culture, you sort of just know what's going on on those shows
2168960	2174840	Yeah, yeah, and yeah, there's no okay. So so so though so the movies are the movies are
2175360	2177360	visually
2179600	2183160	Incredible and with the exception of your odd Mad Max or two
2183240	2190200	They're they're all kind of dumb whereas TV because until we get I mean because I don't know because it's cheaper now
2190200	2192960	And it's lower stakes. It's getting like really, you know
2193480	2194600	Good
2194600	2196680	He said weird octave
2197960	2199960	Getting gooder
2200960	2207720	It's and there's there's lots of shitty shows but it's like there's so many that there's there's something for everybody and there's all kinds of amazing
2207720	2212040	stuff happening so a lot of one part of this Golden Age of TV is
2212840	2219600	Serialization like it's like like no one can argue that Breaking Bad wasn't a great show. Well, someone can I'm sure
2221280	2223280	Who who is that person?
2224520	2226520	Roger
2226520	2228520	Oh
2229560	2231560	Roger Goodell Roger Roger
2232520	2234520	It's that guy's an ass
2235040	2239000	He probably doesn't like Breaking Bad. Yeah. Yeah, I mean somebody's gonna push back, right?
2239000	2242960	It's like but anyways, I'm saying like that's a clear that I mean, there's no more serialized shot
2242960	2247880	I mean, he just did Macbeth over five years and slowly spiraled this character into this beautiful
2248520	2253280	Demise spoilers, but the he he breaks bad and then it gets worse
2256720	2260480	But so here's me and it's not just cuz I'm a sitcom guy
2260480	2265480	I don't think like I have this like I don't is it is my
2268360	2274120	Aversion to serialization is my view of serialization as a crutch as bad craftsmanship
2274120	2278280	Is that a is that now officially a hang-up that I have so I need to let that go
2282200	2284200	George RR Martin with the back
2286520	2294800	What what what is it specifically about the serialization just it feels like cheating because I always because I grew up in the 80s
2294800	2300000	And on TV that was like so supremely crafted no matter how dumb it was
2300000	2302000	It was like there's a sense of craftsmanship
2302080	2307360	Nobody in Cheers ever made a room they picked up a Rubik's Cube and like like like like because it was in the headlines
2307360	2311140	That week it was like I'm sure there's it's not like the shows aren't dated
2311140	2318340	but they're there was also the the attempt was for timelessness and the attempt was for perfect modularity usually and then when and
2318340	2320260	It's always it's that shark jumping thing
2320260	2326340	The or the actual etymology of shark jumping being from serialization when these shows start to start to get desperate
2326340	2332020	They start saying to be continued and I guess that's the association. I make it's like it's like it's like you're starting to I
2332580	2336180	Started feel like when when the internet really started to threaten TV
2336180	2339380	That's when we saw TV start to do like really quickly
2339660	2345660	It was all this like what I regard as a dirty trick on the audience to like like like, you know
2345700	2349460	Throw some weird nonsensical thing at the end of an episode and then go, huh?
2350220	2352220	Now what are you gonna watch next week?
2352780	2358660	And it feels like you're holding them hostage. It's not the same as Breaking Bad, which is like, you know, it's it's
2359500	2361900	But I've always you know people have heard me rant about
2362900	2367060	Everything I've ever ranted about that makes sense to me Breaking Bad broke that rule and did it well
2367060	2369060	I mean, I think the difference is now that
2369220	2371100	Because of the way we now watch TV
2371100	2378340	It's it's you you can watch it back-to-back and you know back in the day before DVR is before streaming you missed episodes
2378620	2383300	No one watched an entire run of any series because you might be out one week
2383300	2388140	You might miss a couple episodes so they had to be kind of self-contained so you could jump in and out and now
2388380	2393020	You don't have to do that both shows if you really like a show you are gonna watch every episode
2393020	2398700	so in a way that that kind of rewards the fans who want to sort of get to know these characters and who want to
2398700	2403700	Go on this journey with with these people. So I don't you know, I think there's something for everyone
2403700	2404380	There's you know
2404380	2411700	What's weird is even though all these shows now are serialized Shonda Rhimes is making a million billions out of out of serialization
2411700	2416040	But then you also have dick wolf who suddenly has four shows on the air this fall
2416040	2420160	All those shows are actually still self-contained. They all take place in Chicago
2420160	2425240	So if you're like fire, then you got one if you like med you got one if you're like PD you got one
2425240	2427720	It's it's that's much more like the serial
2428520	2431800	Style of you know pick pick whichever serial you like pick it up
2432600	2435360	Actively making TV or do you think he's like in a glass coffin?
2438520	2440520	Has anyone ever seen him I
2440840	2447320	Think he's under Mount Rushmore like like and the people aren't like fanning him or like like pumping fluid into some kind of
2447320	2453520	Chamber and there's like I don't even think there's scripts coming out. I think it's just like some young writer comes in and smears
2454600	2458920	smears some of the the embalming fluid on his on his face like war paint and goes
2461160	2465400	And then he charges out on a horse to a typewriter and creates a new law in order
2465400	2467400	I
2470680	2477360	Please note. I'm still saying dick wolf is a very valuable player in the television industry. He's there is a contribution there
2477360	2479360	I just think it's more spiritual and
2480080	2481720	ritualistic probably
2481720	2487800	He sees he's making a lot of money. He is out there. He's you know he's kind of the the master of it all
2487800	2491520	Yeah, I'm not you're not gonna get me to poo-poo all over. Oh, man. Are you kidding me?
2491520	2496720	I'm I mean, I hope my work speaks for itself. I've I've made love to dick wolf
2498280	2500280	several occasions
2500400	2502000	the the the
2502000	2506480	Also, I think how much of it is I hope not during that's for you though. No, just please not during that's me
2507400	2510960	How much is his name though? Cuz it's like perfect, but you you
2511920	2517320	episodes and it's like he hung himself while masturbating and then it just says dick wolf like I think
2517840	2522280	It's like such a visceral. It's like a mic drop. It's like Oh
2524240	2526240	Dick wolf
2527440	2529720	It's dick wolf before he dicks you
2530400	2535040	It would be too on the nose to intuit if they were it was the other you know if it was wolf dick
2535040	2537040	Then you'd be like this is childish
2537840	2542840	But it's so it still looks like a name, but you're getting all those ingredients. It's like dick
2543960	2545960	wolf
2546120	2553000	Pretty strong, right? Yeah strong strong. Yeah, it sends the subliminal signal. This is a I just watched a strong show. Yes
2556800	2558800	That overreacts to the moon
2561520	2564080	Okay, so yeah, okay, I've reached a verdict
2564080	2568560	It's me and it's a hang-up of mine for a bad reason in childhood
2568560	2574200	I was I was watching television that was produced by people that were much like the people producing features today
2574200	2580520	They were afraid to engage the audience too much narratively because it was ratings poison
2580520	2583760	Yeah, and that's not craftsmanship. That's that's
2584440	2586280	corporate just
2586280	2590560	Manufacturing and I grew up in that world, but that's like me saying like I don't know
2590560	2595800	Is it me or is lucky charms better than filet mignon? Like it's like come on. Don't be a dope like
2597320	2599960	I'm no foodie, but it's like yeah
2600920	2601960	I
2601960	2604840	Think because back when we were growing up those those
2605240	2612240	Serialized episodes were pretty pretty cheesy pretty bad sort of find out next week whether or not Gordon jump actually is molesting Dudley, right?
2612240	2616080	They were they were they were death rattles of desperate shows
2616080	2624640	like and it was sad to see previous lists of shows that a few weeks earlier were had cultural efficacy and now you're watching them wheeze and
2624640	2626640	cough and like to tell you to
2627440	2633840	Like I remember different strokes was like man it had a lot of death rattles like there was that molestation episode and then there was a
2634560	2640000	Dudley and was it Dudley and Arnold both got locked inside a
2640720	2645320	Car on the Knight Rider set here. They were visiting Knight Rider
2646760	2648760	Because fuck it
2651520	2655480	Because so it was just looking out the window in the in the in the different strokes writers room
2655480	2659880	And then they looked at the clock and they were like what if he went over there?
2662000	2665040	NBC synergy home by three productions
2669560	2671560	But they sit
2671720	2676760	It was it was it was so ridiculous because Arnold got he visited Knight Rider
2677560	2679720	Talked at Knight Rider, which they've maintained
2679720	2684600	I think they maintained within the fabric of the show that Knight Rider is and a kit is an actual talking car
2685480	2689400	I'm okay with that cuz it's like hey, let's it's cannon and and and
2689880	2693480	But different strokes cannon then he like goes into a car. I don't think it was a night
2693480	2698040	I don't think it was kit. It was a different car and he he gets locked in the car
2699080	2701080	That's not even possible
2701960	2706520	And then two crew hands like walk up and and go
2707600	2712320	Hey, should I move this car? I like no, what are you crazy? That's the car. We're gonna blow up in the next scene
2713040	2715040	And the audience goes oh
2716560	2720320	Like like they had the same reaction as they did to Dudley getting molested
2721720	2726080	Oh, that's the car they're gonna blow up like this is not how Hollywood works. What is it the Flintstones?
2727080	2730800	All right. Anyways, guys don't talk. I'm Andy Rudy
2732880	2737960	Remember there was the the sitcom template where there was always the episode where someone got trapped in something
2738040	2744160	And they possibly were gonna die. So on Punky Brewster, her friend remember got caught stuck in the refrigerator. Yeah
2745040	2749440	Of course we all remember the threes company episode where they're stuck in that freezer and they they could have died
2749440	2756240	So it was like it was like number 72 on the list of like sitcom tropes that everyone had to do at some point
2756240	2761600	It was a simpler world the incredible Hulk won an Emmy for best dramatic series
2761600	2765920	simpler time
2765920	2769400	I think and Lindsay Lindsay Wagner was that her name?
2769400	2775000	I think she got an Emmy for for her best actress in a this in a dramatic series for bionic woman
2776120	2778120	anyways
2780480	2782960	Dear devil, what do you think? Yeah
2784640	2786920	I'm a fan. Absolutely. I
2787880	2792540	Like that that friend of his he made me yeah, I stopped after the pilot cuz of that friend of his
2793800	2796840	His friend just seems a little foggy. Yeah
2797640	2799640	but
2799720	2807400	Thrown by his performance style. Yeah, and I and I I'm lowering my voice because I because Marvel lawyers are listening or
2808160	2812660	No, no, it's because I I get the distinct impression. He's probably a fan
2817200	2823360	Because oh just because he he does it I feel in the pilot he's acting a lot like just a guy that's wandering around comic-con
2825200	2828080	Not so much like a professional actor he just kind of stumbled on set
2828080	2833360	Yeah, and he's just sort of like he's supposed to be like the comic relief and it's just like he's get calm your hair
2835320	2838760	Knock it back the bangs are flying all over the place and something
2838760	2840000	I don't know there's something about him
2840000	2844880	I but then I talked to other people they said actually he'll become your favorite character and he's he gets better and better
2844880	2846880	All right, fine
2847920	2850220	Yeah, I mean I think of all the the comic book
2850760	2855400	Adaptations right now to me the flash is really I mean they killed it in season. I haven't seen it
2856920	2862080	Huh, I just did a really great job and so it's a lot of fun. It's so accessible
2862080	2864580	I actually watch it with my five-year-old my five-year-old loves it now
2864580	2865720	They're there been time
2865720	2869920	I don't know if I'm dad of the year or not because there is you know some death on his show
2869920	2873040	It's there are times where I'm like wondering if I'm just you know
2874000	2876600	Injuring this kid, but he enjoys it. So
2877920	2880280	What so what what are that? What are the flashes?
2881800	2883800	Limitations that seems like a pretty extreme
2884040	2890640	Superpower to just be able to do everything faster than everybody else like that's that's right next to pretty bad at it flying
2890640	2897360	Yeah, like so what is it? What is well do people just sometimes stick their arm out and well and wait
2897880	2902800	And that's like his kryptonite is is it a patient clothes? There's there's a lot of others
2903800	2908880	There's a lot of a lot of baddies out there. There's the reverse flash, you know, there's what is the first flash do
2908880	2912920	What is it? What does he do? Is he same speed backwards or super slow?
2916720	2918600	That would be great
2918600	2923360	There was a flash there's a flash villain that was in the comic book world. It was called the she's not
2923360	2928560	I love that you're not you're like you're a big fan of this character the the what was his name the turtle?
2929160	2933680	The tortoise the turtle of the tortoise he was he was the world's slowest criminal
2934600	2938840	I've only read the description of it. I've ever seen it in the comic book. It was just like give me a break
2938840	2943400	I was like, yeah, he was he was he was a great nemesis to flash because as it as described
2944040	2946040	He would he's so slow that
2946840	2950000	Flash would get to the scene of the crime
2951840	2955320	Investigate it and leave before the turtle ever got there
2956040	2959760	That's pretty slow. That's
2960880	2963480	His that's actually he's not a criminal. Yeah
2964840	2969960	The time space continuum on flashes nemesis is just people who haven't done anything yet
2971080	2974480	That's not he's just an impatient guy. That's person of interest
2975560	2979240	Seriously, what's what is reverse flash? What is it? What does it what does that mean to be a reverse flash?
2979560	2983800	well, so the the the character, you know the guy from Ed
2984520	2986880	Whose name is escaping me right now Tom Calvin horse
2987880	2990880	Are we giving away spoilers by the way because I'm realizing I?
2992360	2994960	Know exactly we're really oh the spoiler alert
2994960	3001240	Oh, so the first season kind of hinges on reverse flash and and what he is. Okay. All right fine. I accept that fine
3001240	3004120	All right, so so what are white walkers?
3008160	3010160	How do they work and how do you kill him?
3010840	3012120	No
3012120	3015720	Yeah, how are you feeling about Game of Thrones right now? I'm behind right now
3015720	3018440	So unfortunately and we're missing tonight, too
3018440	3023360	So I'm I'm a couple episodes behind there's been some controversy about Game of Thrones
3023360	3028240	Like like I guess it's just inevitable about the show was so flawless for so long and everybody's eyes
3028240	3033800	And I was just like it's like it's like a there's like a there's like two lobes to the controversy as far as I can
3033800	3035800	understand it one is
3036800	3038800	That they're starting is
3039240	3042480	They're departing from the books. Yeah more and more
3042480	3044080	I don't know if it's accurate to say more and more
3044080	3049560	But I thought I heard something that their plan was to actually depart from them to it to an extent that it would be okay
3049560	3054000	They just coexist yeah, and you kind of have to at some point, but let me I'm curious what you guys think
3054000	3056760	I mean are you guys cool with them going in a different direction than the books?
3058960	3062920	They're almost caught up to the books anyway right so wouldn't they have to it's like sort of right
3062920	3065640	I mean, that's the thing too is he's racing to finish the next book
3065640	3069360	But then you know at some point all these shows have to go in their own direction
3069360	3075040	I mean that's the thing about Walking Dead as well is that the treat is they do sort of honor the comics
3075040	3079040	But at the same time they've gone in a different direction. They've they've created new characters
3079040	3084600	They've sort of taken things from the comics and sort of switched them around change the time timetable
3084600	3091400	But it's still it's it's enjoyable for both and it's an opportunity to have two different sort of paths for for for for that
3091720	3094720	You know that genre yeah the the other lobe of the
3095240	3101040	Controversy was a really specific thing of like the brutality of the which and I think I think I think the reason why it was
3101040	3104400	So controversial is because also it wasn't in the books
3104400	3110200	So that's kind of the definition of gratuitous is that was Sansa's a wedding night to her
3110200	3115320	It was almost like her third wedding night. She's so Sansa hasn't have had a good life
3116440	3119520	And so so there was her wedding night to shitbag
3121400	3123240	Yeah, Ramsey
3123240	3125240	cool name bad guy
3125600	3131200	She you know he yeah, he whatever but if you don't know it doesn't matter. It's a it's a brutal. It's a bad
3131200	3135240	it's not a great like consensual kind of wedding night and
3136200	3138200	now so so like
3138640	3143480	Cinematically as far as what happens on the screen. It's it's actually one of the least gratuitous things in the game of Thrones history
3143480	3148600	There's a shot of him ripping open the back of her dress and then the rest is played on her terrified face
3148600	3150320	Which is all the more brutal?
3150320	3152440	And also it's like it's like yeah
3152440	3156440	It's like the rest of the show is just like like actual reverse cowgirl action and people everyone
3156680	3161040	No one can actually ever have sex and gave a throne to everyone. Someone's always walking in
3164920	3166920	But I think so so I
3168320	3172080	Okay, so it wasn't in the book okay, and then there's a lot of argument of like well
3172080	3174400	We already knew Ramsey was bad. Why are we doing this? I?
3175400	3180560	And you certainly don't want to dance near the hot button of like the the emerging feminism and stuff
3180560	3183360	And I don't want to take that stuff lightly or dismiss it for dumb reasons
3183360	3188360	But but I will say I feel like the game the whole game of Thrones series not
3188680	3191760	Being not a guy that read the books like when I watch the show
3191760	3197880	I feel like those two sisters Aria and Sansa that the the whole series is like
3198280	3200280	It's this like look to me
3200280	3206480	I'm the whole point of that show is that I'm waiting for the two of them to enter the same room again after all these
3206480	3211080	Years because one of them in the beginning of the show is just a standard like oh
3211080	3216720	I'm I'm the princess archetype and my value is in learning to sew and I'm gonna get married off and I'm a diplomat and I'm
3216720	3221440	Gonna learn how to how to consolidate power from my family because I'm I'm pretty and blah blah blah
3221440	3223240	And then the other girl is like I want to shoot arrows
3223240	3225880	You're not allowed to shoot arrows and it's like okay. We know these archetypes
3225880	3231120	We resonate with them and then they and then there's then then the shit just hits the fan and these two girls in particular
3231120	3236640	They're separated and now we're just watching them like Aria has now become like this weird ninja
3236960	3243760	Assassin that's like learning how to like bend her mind so she can poison people or whatever and like and Sansa is like is
3244280	3249520	Is no less a hero and a bit by virtue of the tragedy that's befalling her
3249520	3252760	It's like it's to it's like the darkest versions of their little
3253000	3259560	Fantasies that we were watching them in them before their lives went to hell and and and so for that one reason I was at
3259560	3264280	When I you know, I was like, well, you know what the the more bad shit that happens to Sansa the better
3264280	3267920	Like right is I mean, maybe that's the point or the I don't know
3268200	3271240	well, I mean, I think I think the thing is
3272360	3274360	You're right. It's a very delicate topic
3274800	3281840	especially right now in society and in the world and you have to be prepared to either justify it or or be
3282040	3289040	Be sort of cognizant that this is going to create a controversy and you better have sort of your explanation ready
3289040	3295600	You better be ready to sort of explain it and and sometimes I'm surprised when networks or producers are caught off guard
3296040	3300320	By controversy when you can start sort of see it a mile away and in this age of social media
3300640	3304120	Anything can become a controversy. So you always have to be ready to
3304920	3310000	Explain yourself and and you know justify the the direction that you go on a show
3310000	3316680	So that's where I kind of sort of still don't understand is when people aren't ready to have they had have they had a response
3316680	3321920	Has there been a response from the production side to the controversy? Is anyone issued a statement saying like look here's
3322760	3327840	Leave us alone. We're Game of Thrones or anything. Have they said yeah, I mean they've come out and said, you know
3327840	3332000	What if we we apologize if we have offended people that you know
3332000	3338560	This that that wasn't the the purpose of the storyline this, you know, the sort of the usual sort of explanation and and so
3339480	3343880	You know, they're they're big, you know, so I have a question
3344520	3346240	I thought
3346240	3351400	Thank You Curtis. Well, I was just I was just wondering something because I might be wrong because I'm way behind
3351400	3353400	I'm still in the books
3353560	3355560	but
3356560	3358560	My question is
3358840	3364960	My question is that the problem with this particular case was that it actually and correct
3364960	3371900	I know I will be instantly corrected that it was something that in the books did not happen to that character
3371920	3375360	It was something that was imposed on the character. Is that correct?
3375960	3380840	So that was the reason for the controversy. It wasn't the fact that it was a rape or how how
3381560	3383840	Visually brutal it was it was that they
3384600	3390200	Arbitrarily took another character and gave right the rape to this character. Yeah, I think it was all the above
3390400	3390920	Yeah
3390920	3392520	That say it was sort of just you know
3392520	3398160	The the perfect storm of this this was going to incite some some concern out there and then on social media, especially
3398160	3402520	You know, this is an age of social media as you know, Dan that yeah, you know, and that's
3403320	3406760	Actually, it's weird, you know, it's a like we're sopranos deadwood
3407280	3408920	Game of Thrones, I mean
3408920	3411120	I'm not I'm not defending anything
3411120	3415160	But the the the the the word for the other side is that let's say come on
3415160	3421240	What what are we getting high on when we're watching these shows? It's like like the you know, there's a there's a point when like
3421880	3426640	Like it looks like I'm trying to avoid spoilers. So I'm just speaking in very general things
3426640	3428920	but there's a there's a point when it looks like
3429800	3432720	Peter Dinklage might might die and that's not a spoiler
3432720	3434800	It just look it just see it's just like he's in it
3434800	3437720	He's in a tough physical spot and I found myself going like, you know what?
3437720	3442800	This could be it like I and that's that's that's what makes that show so amazing. That's what made Breaking Bad really interesting
3442800	3449000	It's like the brutality and the randomness the chaos. It's like, holy shit. Like I don't know
3449000	3454880	I mean that that shows first season ends in one of the biggest like like like what the fucks in the
3455200	3459440	TV history because you're like what what he was Michael thrones
3463680	3466560	You killed Michael thrones TV, it's his game
3469000	3473680	Cersei literally five minutes earlier told him to give him the game of throne speech
3473680	3478720	Remember, she's like if you're going to play this game of thrones, I suggest you be very careful. He's like, okay
3478720	3480720	I will be careful skunk
3481800	3484600	And we were like holy shit and we were like, you know
3484600	3490140	We're tearing in our shirts and we're like freaking out and then we just like sat there and waited for the next season because we're like
3490220	3496780	Holy shit, and it's happened a thousand times in that show since then and so that would be that's the only I'm not
3496780	3498980	I'm neither defending nor nor nor nor
3499220	3505260	Nor nor attacking because of the sensitivity of the issue and it's like I don't want to I don't want to mansplain
3506620	3509740	About any of that stuff. I don't want to I don't I want to stay on the TV
3509860	3515060	like consumer side of this thing and not I'm not there's none of my business on the gender side the
3515380	3521100	And but that's the other thing to consider is just like, you know it the fucking like fruit brutality
3522100	3523620	We can't
3523620	3527660	Because the argument I keep hearing is like we already come on. Give me a break. We already knew that guy was a bad guy
3527660	3530860	I'm like, well, that's come on that by that argument
3531380	3534420	Oscar the grouch is as bad as it should get because he's like
3535460	3541100	Like if you if you if you want if you want to freak people out Oscar's got a like lunge at Big Bird's throat every once
3541860	3544340	I fucking hate birds cuz I'm racist
3545380	3549340	Just blood everywhere a series finale of Sesame Street
3551140	3556620	Fade to black. Why don't why don't we bring out media correspondent Spencer Crittenden?
3556620	3574360	Is that I walked in with a bag is that I brought a paper bag it says Hannah on it in Sharpie
3575140	3579020	It's not an emergency is Hannah here. Okay. There's it Hannah
3579900	3585160	Aaron packed a little bag for her. Okay. Good. I thought I'd use Spencer sit-down time
3585320	3590000	Is that it? Does it say Hannah on it? Yeah, it does. Okay, someone in here. This is below your pay grade
3590000	3596240	You're a comptroller, but you can you can hand it off. All right, there it goes to Marissa and they're we have like a whole congregation
3596240	3598240	I know people's names. Oh
3598280	3601720	Oh, that's for error. That's the backpack. Is that just a drug deal? Yeah
3607440	3609040	I
3609040	3614240	Had this idea where you could sell cocaine out of a bowling alley by putting it in the shoes
3615280	3618640	And this is very similar to that whole methodology
3623840	3631240	What TV shows are you watching Spencer? Oh, you know, I don't know. Well, I just started watching Silicon Valley and
3634960	3637760	Yeah Game of Thrones, you know, okay
3638600	3644600	Okay, this is not spoilers the you know, it's been said that obsidian can kill those white walkers
3645400	3648360	and they've revealed arrowheads made of obsidian and
3649320	3654680	Spoiler alert sometimes the white walkers watch things. They just stand there watching stuff happening
3654720	3662380	Why can't they just shoot him in the fucking face with obsidian arrows? It'd be done. It'd be over it all be giving no more game
3663920	3668080	You mean like the leaders yeah, they just fucking stand there
3669120	3671040	assholes I
3671120	3676280	Don't know when I saw those obsidian arrowheads, I was like, what the fuck are you idiots doing?
3676280	3679800	If you didn't show the arrowheads, I wouldn't have this question in my brain
3680680	3682680	Okay, sorry. I
3683280	3690400	Know but I mean there's only a limited supply of white walkers. There's not infinite of them. You could just four arrows done
3690720	3695040	Yeah, okay. Sorry everybody bumming everybody out with obsidian
3696200	3698520	all I've been thinking about you guys is just
3698520	3699760	of
3699760	3706360	Just Minecraft just just Minecraft blood magic shit. All right. Well, it's 9-11. Yay
3708760	3711360	That's it's always off-putting to the new guests
3716200	3721520	9-11 there's no and there is no hidden layer to it. We they cheer at 9-11 because we've trained them to and
3722600	3725280	our goal is just to be bad people like
3725880	3727240	All
3727240	3733400	Right. So all right Golden Age of TV. All right. All right, but Silicon Valley, by the way, you're having a great second season
3733400	3738440	If you guys are I'm way behind on that. I haven't watched since the finale of the first one. It's good, ma'am
3738680	3739800	I'm kind of scared
3739800	3745640	I need to I need to hear that before I before I dive in because like Camille's a very good friend of the show
3745640	3751480	It's like if I have like what if I hate it you won't you won't yeah, he's great. He's better this sees
3751480	3754100	I mean not he like his parts are better this season. I think
3755280	3757280	He's always perfect
3757840	3760040	Come back who mail and dreamy
3763800	3765920	What are you guys thinking about this season of orphan black
3768480	3771080	Boo, oh my god, I love that
3771920	3776120	You love you love I love orphan black. It's it's a great show
3776560	3779040	It's going it's really getting into the weeds though
3779040	3783600	So it's so I feel like the last not this past Saturday's episode
3783640	3788640	But the week before I felt like they're getting back on track. So fingers crossed
3788640	3791600	I feel like you know, I'm in I'm in it for for for good
3791600	3797040	I think but I feel like maybe now they're getting back on track more Allison. There wasn't enough Alice in this season
3797040	3800960	Oh, no, but you know what they've got more Helena and Helena. Oh
3802120	3807640	Sister oh my god. Yeah, right. I love Tatiana Maslani
3807640	3816120	I'm sorry, but I love Tatiana Maslani. I I get I think I think it's good with olive oil
3817760	3821720	So just a little salt a nice Tatiana Mussolini
3823680	3825680	For the whole table
3827760	3836040	The so are you married Schneider? Yes, did when you to a lady? Yes, see how modern I am. Look at you
3838640	3840640	Oh
3843040	3849720	I was thinking so speaking of gay marriage I I I thought of one more reason to support it while I was
3850960	3852960	Getting dressed a couple days ago
3853120	3857680	Like 80% of all straight marriages are gross people
3858600	3860600	And all gay marriages are adorable
3862120	3867160	I've never I've never seen a gay couple and I'm not talking about like because they're good-looking people
3867160	3871560	I'm saying I've never seen a gay couple and and gone like ah those two are those two suck
3872920	3878560	But I all constantly like universal city walk is just a fucking parade of shit bags
3880080	3887120	And they're all straight married couples, I mean, what are we protecting? All right. Anyways, that was my culture say
3887120	3889120	I think that's a big city walk issue actually
3891000	3893240	Like did you see that documentary with Georgia Cain is
3893880	3896000	George Cain his husband or they're goddamn adorable
3896000	3899920	Oh, they're George the kid is that condescending to say is that like a new form of homophobia to go?
3899920	3903800	They're adorable. Is that am I infantilizing them? George? Okay is the best though
3904160	3909000	They're there. I'm not saying they're adorable as human beings to dehumanize. I'm saying their marriage is adorable
3909680	3911680	Yes, it will. He's adorable
3912200	3914200	That's racist. Okay
3914200	3916200	So
3920720	3924920	So when you when you when you come home to your wife and she's like
3925480	3931380	She's like like I was gonna endow her as like washing dishes, but then I started to spiraling into like feminist
3932280	3937920	reaction, but I'm saying she just she finished her job as like a powerful attorney and she's just
3938880	3942800	She ate a little bit of protein on a plate and she's just cleaning her own plate
3943160	3950440	That's what you guys she's a graphic designer. So she's she's washing a dish and and she's not good at it
3954400	3956400	She's like fuck
3958680	3960680	And I
3960760	3965880	Just wanted to put her in a position where you you guys are a sweet married couple and you're coming up behind her
3965880	3970020	It's like you're going to what tonight Harmon town. Really? You're spending more time with Dan Harmon
3970740	3978240	What is that do you ever come up behind her and put your hands over her eyes and then and then
3979140	3982620	Sweetly whisper in her ear. Is your Schneider sense tingling?
3986700	3988700	As coined by Dan Harmon
3989340	3994500	I'm really sure I really want to make this happen. You uh, it's funny you you tweeted that out to me
3994500	3998980	But then there were Michael Schneider's across the country who actually tweeted back at you
3999060	4000180	and
4000180	4002180	But thanking you I guess
4007100	4012660	I think it's how you should open all of your columns anything that you write you should say. Hey, is your 90 cents tingling exactly
4013300	4018020	Whatever panel I moderate from here on out at comic-con. That's all yeah, like when you're doing it
4018020	4023960	Yeah, yeah comic-con you can go. Hey, is your Schneider sense tingling? Hey, it's me Mike Schneider another rape on Game of Thrones last night
4025980	4027980	And the fans are a buzz
4028980	4030980	Stay tuned
4031620	4033620	The okay, all right, all right, all right
4033620	4037380	Well, well I was I was actually bringing up your wife because I was just curious like okay
4037380	4041660	So she's a graphic designer. I was assuming she's kind of a TV buff or maybe not
4041660	4042580	I don't know what yeah
4042580	4043460	We watch a lot of TV together
4043460	4049180	but the problem is we fall asleep in front of the TV at different times so then we can't actually ever delete anything on the
4049180	4054740	DVR cuz I got to watch all that episode. She didn't and then she watched something I didn't and
4055740	4059140	So we were never actually deleting anything. Yeah, I
4059780	4065260	Don't have a point to that story. It's just it's just reality folks. Are you are you a positive TV viewer?
4065260	4067940	like when you're watching are you are you always you don't seem like a very
4069860	4073500	Judgmental I'm not a critic so that that helps I don't have to critique shows
4073500	4079180	You know you're not like but you don't watch it through that lens of like grumble grumble grumble or sharks snarky snark snark snark
4079180	4084700	No for the most part not I mean if if if if I had a bad run-in with someone that
4084740	4090740	It kind of it does maybe cloud a little bit my viewing pleasure example example
4095900	4102780	They're clapping, but they're not chanting. They're not so they like my chanting the half-hearted. I think we're supposed to do a jig at that point
4103700	4106720	You can't you can't give an example. Can you I probably can
4107900	4109900	Vince Gilligan was like he
4110260	4112860	Mistook you for a waiter at a it's at a luncheon
4113860	4117500	Exactly no Vince is like one of the sweetest guys. Yeah. Yeah, I know
4118100	4125100	Great guy, that's why does the best TV writer have to also be the nicest it fucks up everything for everybody, right?
4125780	4127780	Cuz it's like oh, Dan. Why are you an asshole?
4128620	4130620	clearly no actual reason
4133540	4136740	Before Vince Gilligan like Brovio popped you know as like
4137220	4142100	Mr. Congeniality like it was you know you could there was a there was a there was a it was like
4142100	4146720	It was a it was a myth that you could perpetuate you could go like look. I'm too. I'm too talented to be nice
4147940	4149940	But now he's just like
4152980	4154980	And he makes the darkest TV
4161140	4162940	Yeah, you introduced me to Vince Gilligan
4162940	4168820	Which is like the biggest favor I think anyone's ever done me because he then he ended up doing a prospector on right on community
4168820	4170820	And he's he's so awesome
4170820	4173500	And he I never did get my finders fee
4174740	4176740	You don't consider this a reward
4178780	4184200	Me bringing you out and talking about rape and grilling you about your marriage
4184900	4186660	the he
4186900	4192900	Came to the set and was like off book for his prospector character and was so like
4194100	4198540	Determined to do a good professional job as an actor. It was it was it was awesome
4198540	4200940	Like he was like he I don't know
4200940	4204060	I just again didn't have to he doesn't have to give a shit
4204060	4206860	He could have like rolled in there in a diaper and been like
4207420	4209420	someone get the shit out of this
4209940	4211340	I
4211340	4218140	Like give me a lemonade and then a teleprompter cuz I'm not gonna learn anything. I make TV
4218140	4220140	I'm not gonna learn your TV
4220500	4223600	But he came in dressed as a cowboy and was like, where do I stand?
4225020	4227420	All right, let me let me let me get let me get in the zone
4227980	4234380	Howdy partners and he's fucking fucking nailed it. He'd been working on it all night. He knew how to fucking twirl a gun. He's like
4235340	4238580	But the showrunner who nailed it, of course was Mitch Hurwitz
4239420	4248380	Yeah, he's amazing we gotta have him have him back on here. Yeah, you got more coupler
4250340	4254840	All right, let's uh, let's we should bring out DeMord Brown
4258180	4260980	If he's here I saw him here, all right
4260980	4269180	This is Mike Schneider from TV Guide magazine. He's the chief content officer
4270660	4272660	CC yo
4273100	4275100	Yo
4275980	4278740	Well, you want to weigh in on the state of television
4281300	4288260	No, yes, no, I mean I don't know what else there's to say it's changing and it's changing and I think that
4290980	4297500	The audience is this sort of dictating the format right now. It's still finding its place. It's still grounding itself
4297500	4299580	But oh, here's a question
4299580	4302260	That's but that's venue related and the stories are you know
4302260	4309500	Everybody's sort of heightening stakes and it's just the audience is responding to what it wants and everybody else is trying to keep up
4310260	4315860	Speaking of which well one more thing about TV. That's an important breaking topic
4316860	4320140	Algorithmic versus development like there's this new thing
4320140	4325860	It's like no joke that Netflix was assembled by someone looking at a chart of Kevin Spacey fans
4325980	4328860	Also like political thrillers and also like what's her name?
4329740	4331740	Like when they assemble the show
4333260	4339620	Based on an algorithm, but they they skipped that whole thing of like, oh the writer comes up with an idea and then the suit like
4340180	4342180	you know helps him because
4342660	4343860	Whatever
4343860	4347580	Ostensibly suits no more than writers about making TV, which is the dumbest idea
4347580	4348980	It's like doesn't make any sense
4348980	4353980	But and I see you know, I see people having different opinions about that because it does sound a little Orwellian
4353980	4360940	I mean Yahoo knew I think I've told the story of like Yahoo knew that knew what community was worth before they bought it
4361020	4364540	not what it was worth I doubt they I doubt they turn a profit on community because
4365580	4372020	They probably paid a lot of money for it. So how would you make that back? I think I don't think their intention was determined
4372660	4378420	I think their intention was to draw big numbers and they knew that those numbers would be big because they they already knew I
4378420	4384220	Had a conversation with them where they revealed that they already knew yeah, have they shown you any numbers before the show aired
4384220	4390780	But now I already knew now and then yeah, everything is going according to their fucking weird like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park
4392180	4397520	Like they they graphed out a bell curve like they they of unique impressions
4398040	4401120	Potential and blah blah blah that's just it's just going according to plan
4401120	4404360	They're like NASA technicians that just they were never worried about it
4404360	4408200	And I'm sitting there going like you hope I hope we do okay on Tuesday night because I'm like this caveman
4408200	4413520	and they're like Silicon Valley people that are just like they can like melt things with their eyes and
4415320	4420820	They get shit done for a living and then there's like you contrast that with this like these orange people lately
4422160	4426880	Development people that are like so I don't think a female lead is gonna work
4427080	4431360	Why don't wear it? Why don't you think what do you who are you? Where did you go to school?
4431360	4436480	What seminar did you attend? Who are you? Hey, my name's Michael Jacobson
4438400	4441180	You just burnt a bridge you're not gonna be able to build back see
4444080	4446260	Mr. Hollywood I make television
4448400	4451240	I hope I hope there's no one actually named Mike Jacobson
4451880	4456900	You're gonna hear about that all of them. I'm bright orange. I'm an orange person. I
4460840	4465400	Have three posters on the wall behind me one is for a show I worked on which is a piece of shit
4466280	4471760	One is for a classic TV that I didn't work on the others for like some fucking French thing
4471760	4474520	That's for the French title, so it looks like I'm smart
4475480	4477480	And I've never seen it
4478400	4482200	Badly for shows like like homicide life on the streets that sort of
4482560	4489560	Had to run this this gauntlet of like of anonymity and and and also being praised because there were pours into that network
4489560	4490080	Yeah
4490080	4495240	And there are a lot of those shows that would have lasted a lot longer if they'd been on now because they have that rabid
4495240	4499440	Fan base, but it just was the wrong popular and would have been seen more probably right
4499440	4503360	I talked to people about that show and they like I have no idea what that is and it blows my mind
4503800	4507640	It was they all love the wire. Yeah, it was ahead of it ahead of its time
4507640	4513200	So it would it would have last like ten years now if it was on today and who knows they're bringing back everything
4513200	4517320	So maybe one day they'll bring that back. So right after an all-new Fuller house. I
4520280	4525600	Can't believe the full house thing is happening and then like it was announced that they were gonna do full house
4525600	4531040	And then a couple weeks later the new headline was Dave Cooley a signs on to do father
4531640	4533920	Dude you you close that deal first
4536080	4539200	I'm no full house fan, but you don't do it without the cools
4543080	4544840	What are you gonna have
4544840	4549400	Zach Efron doing bullwinkle impressions for the for the 32 year old
4549920	4551280	girls
4551280	4558960	Tucks them in the cools contract rider was just you know unattainable first, but no they were all they were all pretty much on
4558960	4562320	I mean, it was funny just a couple days ago. They said finally that sag it was on board
4562320	4566240	But he's been on board from the beginning. They just need to have yeah. Yeah, I should know that more than anybody
4566240	4571960	We're always like taping our third episode when Alison Breeze contract closes, you know, like it's always like
4574880	4579680	Yeah, they have different different people need different amounts of time to scare me
4581480	4587680	All right, so will you will you stay and play shadow run I know it's probably your favorite part of the podcast
4589720	4595520	It's a right should I I would like you to I like it when our guests do it Curtis
4595880	4603360	Curtis was a nuke newcomer and I was once new. Yes, and you like my shadow. I'm so experienced
4603360	4605360	I'm almost cynical about the
4608960	4613040	You're gonna phone it in tonight. Yeah, probably but that's okay. I'm it's like a role-playing game
4613040	4617320	Did you ever do that as a kid ever play role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons anything like that? Oh a long time ago
4617400	4622280	Yeah, but so it's like you get your character sheet. It's got a bunch of nonsense on it. Sorry Spencer
4623320	4625480	It's like you what it won't I mean, it's like
4626320	4634400	We're all drunk and it's like armor. I'm gonna mess this up horribly, but yeah, but primarily it's just like improvised storytelling and a turn-based
4635200	4638820	Format with Spencer is the only one can actually say what happens
4638820	4643920	But you we the rest of us when it's our turn can say what we want to try to do
4644440	4646440	It's probably a good pretty good explanation
4647920	4649920	Um
4649920	4655480	So do we we got we got it we got a doctor you're playing the doctor, right?
4655480	4660440	I guess I am but I mean you went on to another story. I don't know if dr. Friend is still in the store
4662440	4667380	Story, yeah, he was in doctor friends still you don't cut cowboy out of midnight cowboy
4668360	4669600	and
4669600	4671360	demoriges, of course
4671360	4673360	coda gods, yeah, and
4673400	4675400	So I wonder if we should just have
4675800	4678400	Schneider play Mercy O'Donnell or I
4680440	4685920	Know I had a little I had a discuss because Erin Erin Erin's Erin's like text to me during the show sometimes when she's not
4685920	4687920	Doing it. She's gonna watch it live and I
4691160	4694920	Don't know she's just like you always you always have a girl come up to play
4695160	4698720	Mercy and then we got one of those conversations my point of view was like well
4699320	4701320	Yeah, but like
4701360	4707080	We don't we don't have a lot of women up here and then it's like it's not it's not because only a woman can play the
4707080	4712320	Character is just because like they make up half the planet and then we and then we and then we don't have any up here
4712320	4714320	And then there's like a character. That's a lady
4714840	4717280	God, it's hard to be a white knight these days
4721440	4727440	That's what I've learned that's the dude that's the phrase for what I do constant I'm always white knighting that's my thing
4727800	4733280	White knighting man, but it's not it's not it's not it's not the it's not the doing it to get laid thing
4733280	4736960	So it's it's the it's the I'm just doing it to try to trick people into liking me
4737200	4742680	Like give these women a break ma'am a big hero. I think that's that's usually why people do it
4742680	4746320	I don't think the you know those gallant nerds are trying to get laid
4746320	4752160	They're just trying to do what they think I mean make people like them if we're gonna eliminate that as a
4752920	4756760	you know if trying to make people like you isn't a good reason to
4757440	4761640	Not be racist or sexist or anything like I mean I might have to just give up I
4762720	4768040	Don't know what else is in it for me anymore. I kind of I'm just gonna like roll over and die. Yay
4769240	4771500	I heard your brains
4773720	4775720	Weird young hologram brains
4777680	4780880	Hurry up and die old man, so we can have our future world
4780880	4792040	Get out of our way fatty old fat man with your dumb
4793560	4800200	70s concepts wait I said dumb 70s and positive someone said glasses
4810880	4817720	Like first of all like I was searching for the word glasses while touching them
4818320	4820320	What do you call these on my face?
4822160	4824160	Second of all come on
4824880	4826880	supposed to be safe here
4828920	4835680	Calling myself old and fat and you're and you're going don't forget your glasses are dumb and you and you don't shower either
4841560	4843480	All
4843480	4848360	Right so wait so we got a mercy we got a night blade. We got a hoarder guard. We got a we got a doctor
4848840	4851920	What is it? I mean do with the Jeff's character fine
4852800	4855800	We got we got a lot of them have a girl have a girl play Jeff's character
4857120	4862080	We got Annie. We got real-life Annie. Well. You've got you've had your big moment in the spotlight. I
4864680	4866680	Don't think that's a good enough reason
4870920	4872920	Kind of beleaguered by
4875800	4877800	People feel like I should
4885880	4887880	That sounds like a mandate
4888760	4893640	We just don't even have enough say yeah, right we got all yeah, we don't even have enough chairs. Oh my bad
4893640	4899440	I this is all behind people. We're not gonna reject Annie and then say yes to Adam. That's not no. That's not
4900040	4902040	That's crazy. I
4902920	4906680	Sure was all right, but we're going to hold back sit
4907560	4910040	One of these days Curtis will be back in I know
4910720	4912720	Right to the moon Adam Goldberg
4913480	4916120	Told me in the green room, which he's not allowed in
4917360	4921400	That he wrote a did knock though, which if you knock on the green room door
4921400	4925800	What does that mean and like a vampire means why are you answered? Why are you near the green room?
4929440	4933680	No, I I enjoyed I enjoyed his knock though. It was it was pleasurable to me
4935280	4940520	He wrote a quit he wrote a quiz which obviously we don't have time to do tonight, but I thought he wrote it for the AV Club
4941120	4945040	I'm yeah, I'm way my assistant is so fired
4948200	4952440	What's up, I mean should I get is Dustin gonna do a music or
4953080	4958080	Am I gonna do it off a cappella? Are you guys is that even what you guys are looking for right now Annie?
4958080	4960600	Why don't you come up? Do you need help?
4963120	4965120	Okay
4965160	4967160	Yeah, I forgot
4967360	4975040	Okay, we'll have Annie play. I can't remember goddamn Jeff. Yeah, that is yours Eve Libertine Eve Libertine. Okay. All right. Thank you, Annie
4975280	4977280	real life, Annie
4977280	4979280	I
4979440	4981680	After that enthusiastic, no
4983680	4986440	No, I just sort of conditional love lap it up
4987840	4989840	Hi, did you like the finale?
4993760	4999800	Like you're like, oh pick up this costume and I'm like, okay sure and then it's like this literally this whole scene about
5000080	5005840	What we're about what we were talking about and like and then and then with that button of Annie saying like miss wearing skirts
5006000	5009760	Like it was like it was like you were speaking and it was like we were speaking
5010760	5015160	Did you what did you think about the because I was I was it was like three in the morning
5015160	5017160	we were about to shoot the last scene and
5017240	5023800	I'd been up all night and I got I wrote the scene and Annie enters the study room and Jeff is standing there and the cursor
5023800	5026440	Has been blinking there forever and I wrote like four different versions
5026440	5031360	Like I wrote like truly raunchy like the joke is how horny they are for each other
5031800	5037200	Scenes and I then I erased it and I wrote like like, oh, why are we still forcing this?
5037200	5042880	We're not into this and versions and I just like all erased and the cursor still blinking and then I had Aaron an instant message
5043120	5048380	And I said, what do I do? I had a way. What do I do here? And Aaron said have you ever seen drop dead Fred?
5049360	5051360	and
5051400	5056280	And I said, no, I actually haven't seen it and she was like, it's a very there's a very sweet kiss at the end of drop
5056280	5060320	Dead Fred she has to kiss drop dead Fred. Goodbye. It's not a sexual kiss
5060320	5066040	It's not it's not necessarily an unromantic kiss, but it's not it's not it's not it's not
5066320	5070040	They're not macking on each other as the kids said in 1982
5071840	5076660	The but it was like a it was like it was a kiss goodbye like it was it was love
5078600	5080600	What did you think
5080600	5086480	Well, I try not to ship because I believe that the people who are making our television for us should be making those decisions
5086480	5089680	And people shouldn't be complaining on the internet about it just because they want to see two people kiss
5090520	5092520	shit
5096520	5098520	But that being said
5099000	5105600	Two things not only was it a really nice and not really done thing. I also really loved that in Jeff's fantasy
5105600	5109680	He was wearing the same that she was wearing the same outfit. Like he's still coming back to that like
5110560	5112760	Yeah, well that was easy faster to shoot that way
5116240	5118240	The truth comes out
5119760	5125480	Alright anyways, yeah, that was weird for me to fish like like actually I was I didn't I wasn't I wanted more to give Aaron
5125480	5130680	credit for for helping me write the the final scene of the of the season and
5131120	5137720	With some nice sweet advice cold from a silly movie that I hadn't seen shit. That's it. That's called a muse
5139360	5141360	That's what you call. Yeah
5142960	5145600	Because women can't be writers, but they can be muses
5149680	5153920	It's not that horrible Sharon Stone movie. It's an Albert Brooks movie
5157480	5159480	They were both in it
5159480	5161480	All right
5161720	5167600	All right. Well, let's I mean, I guess that's that's that's it. We got a what else could I possibly do to slow down the show?
5168240	5170240	Okay. Oh, did you notice I'm in costume?
5170680	5175560	Well, yeah, you're kind of you're wearing the same thing, right? The costume in question sort of
5176480	5177840	Yeah
5177840	5184200	You're so impressed. You're all just silent. It's amazing. Yeah, I mean don't come to cosplay. It's this boring
5185200	5187640	Well, yeah when you're cosplaying just a regular person
5196360	5199640	For those of you who aren't watching on the video feed and he just threw her cane
5200560	5204400	I'm so mad in anger because no one applauded her outfit
5206040	5212020	Now you just fear, you know, they weren't gonna do it. Oh, okay. Now that's horrible. That's a toxic
5213560	5218440	That was terrible that was like that little tiny third that comes out of my dog when I make him poop
5218960	5220960	I'm like, you can't
5221200	5222480	You're a crate training him
5222480	5228480	You better pretend to pee if nothing else and then you can come back in and eat and he's like a little drop comes out
5229440	5230840	All right
5230840	5232680	Is there a guest
5232680	5238600	Mike are you are you having a good time? Yes, although I'm nervous now cuz I really I'm gonna screw this up
5238600	5241600	Have you memorized the sheet yet? I'm gonna take them back in two minutes
5245960	5249000	You'll very quickly see that nervousness will give way to
5249640	5251360	frustration and boredom
5251360	5254120	Not not induced by your skills
5254120	5258960	I mean, I'd say it is but yeah if you get if you get confused just kind of
5259200	5265600	Withdraw you don't have to really dig in deeper and try and understand any of that stuff. So there you go
5266240	5268240	and now
5268480	5270480	It's time
5271320	5273320	For a new episode of
5275240	5277240	Shadowrun
5280040	5286680	Oh, is there a guest that we have to give credit for yeah, this one is just a tweet that Jeff Davis sent. Oh, okay
5286680	5290200	This is guest guest summarizer Jeff Davis. Yep
5291280	5293880	All right, is there it was it? Where's the cue?
5294560	5296560	Here it is
5297400	5298960	All right
5298960	5304280	Harman town Shadowrun recap now Eve had an eagle flap tear gas out
5304600	5309080	Mercy was composed but cried night blade baked to guards brains
5309760	5311760	Dicks were of average size
5314000	5316000	That's that's it
5317680	5318440	I
5318440	5321640	Baked a brain. Yeah, I mean realistically
5322080	5328480	Someone broke a window so that tear gas could leave and then you taste someone so hard as brain melted
5329640	5332800	All right, so we're like in a room in this kind of hospital
5332800	5337640	You're in the hospital of of a brain plus limited you're in the C beta ward
5337800	5343520	You snuck in there using using lies and Sutter feuds to try and infiltrate this place
5343600	5346320	You're looking for secret stolen data
5346320	5352040	Well, I don't know if it's all secret data that you're trying to steal for your employer
5352600	5359480	Anything? Yeah, are we all in the same room? Yeah, you're all in the same room. There's two guards knocked out on the floor
5359480	5366240	They're unconscious. All right. Well, you guys know what I'm thinking. It's the old dress as a guard
5366240	5368240	I
5372080	5375200	Just started taking off the guards one of the guards pants
5377040	5380480	The my I'm a man of action now, I'm not gonna explain myself
5381680	5383120	And
5383120	5388080	Since we're in a hospital and I'm a doctor. I'm going to stay in my clothes
5389160	5393120	And just pretend like I'm a doctor in this hospital. Yeah
5393840	5395760	Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah, okay
5395760	5399920	I'm gonna size up my compatriots and compare them to the sizes of the
5400520	5406120	Indisposed guards to see who might fit in their clothes better. Um, one of the guards is
5407280	5409280	human sized
5409360	5411920	That's the only guard his clothes haven't been removed
5416920	5422240	So, so yeah, all right, I'll undress this guard and stick these human sized clothes on and
5423120	5428800	They feel really good. They they absolutely do
5432480	5434480	Pleather
5435720	5440720	Since horda guard since you kind of have the psychic abilities, but I'm also rather minute
5441600	5443600	So perhaps the clothes would not fit on me
5444240	5446240	That's quite true
5446840	5451040	Think they'd fit me. Yeah. Yeah, I'd say you're pretty average
5451040	5456880	I'll get dressed up as the the other guard that happens two suits of guard clothes
5458280	5460280	All right
5461480	5463480	Now we need a plan
5467560	5469800	You have normal people clothes
5472560	5479520	Well, there aren't any more guards if you know that could be an avenue to explore yeah, maybe we should go find some more and
5481040	5486680	I was wondering if I could use spell casting to create a uniform for myself. No, I'm sorry
5488280	5490280	Why don't you
5491120	5497760	Psychically scope out the outside area see if where they get a lay of the land. So I'm going to use a short of
5498600	5500600	one of these
5502080	5506480	Sort of mental mental waves mental planning sort of active sauce
5507200	5510720	To scope and see if there are any guards in the bitch in the vicinity
5511120	5516120	You got that was it like a detect detect humans kind of spell?
5516120	5522800	This is good at that provided that yeah provided the guards are human. Yes. Yeah. All right. Well you do that you detect
5523160	5530240	Not any guards anywhere nearby or in the outside hall except for the one that you will you can't detect it because that's dead
5530480	5531520	but
5531520	5537960	You detect humans not in this hall, but in the next hall over there's all sorts of them with weaker auras
5537960	5544980	Some of them are sick and damaged you could tell they've had cyberwares and certain ailments that are
5545320	5549320	Causing their spirits to look differently colored the normal to your senses
5550200	5554840	This would suggest to me that they are perhaps patients. It would subjects
5556360	5560880	That the chips might also be in this room. Is this possible that they're being tested on them
5562640	5564560	You don't know anything about that
5564560	5568000	I have like a I have a I have a like a meta question
5568280	5574720	Yes, like would do I not remember you saying didn't we scope this place out?
5574720	5580640	And there's like some computer room like up. There's a security room and the top floor of the building that
5581560	5587760	Someone found I don't know who it was. That's got to be where like the butterfly would be right involved
5587760	5591200	Well, it would be with security. Oh, let's rate the butterfly. Yeah
5592120	5594120	I mean look
5594600	5596600	Jeez, I'm not really a thinking man
5598200	5600520	It's not that the guy playing me is stupid it's
5601600	5605240	the guy playing me is it like the Dustin Hoffman of role-playing and
5606640	5610760	The the character me I'm just an idiot and a little drunk I
5612600	5617920	Deserve accolades not not for anyone to think I'm a bad bad player
5618360	5620360	I
5620640	5626720	Okay, I guess I'm kind of I've kind of lost like I think I think I think we just got to find like records room
5626720	5629200	I guess I would start up with that security area
5630200	5633880	Does the maps off is it detailed enough to have a map inside the building?
5634000	5639520	No, you don't have any maps of this building quite. I use my vision zoom
5641000	5643840	Look through the building to find
5644760	5646480	the
5646480	5650880	Security room the vision zoom is like a magnifying kind of thing
5650880	5655020	I can't see through stuff, but like you could see like but I could see feet away. I could see
5655640	5661200	Okay, so if I leave looking for it, I'll use my vision zoom and
5661800	5669280	I'll be in the hallway. Yeah, and I can see it right at the end of the hallway if it is there. Yes
5670040	5673560	But it's not well, I mean let me look
5674160	5681120	You head out into the hallway using your vision zoom, and you only see a hallway leading to the
5685200	5687200	The B beta Ward
5692600	5701360	Yeah, you look around and you locate a small a small plaque that has an as a virtual readout of the map of the place
5701480	5709540	And you can see all the offices with listings for all the employees, and there's an office that still lists Baldwin Brown
5712480	5716920	Now we're getting somewhere I would suggest we use my sneaking four plus two
5719000	5723920	To sneak there it's gonna be quite some ways you trace your way through the map
5723920	5729200	And you're gonna at least have to go down some stairs. They're located by the central cafeteria area
5729200	5731200	I can't do stirs well
5732480	5734480	Meta there's a
5734720	5741680	Well, it's a me and me and mercy will go with you, and yeah, well if she's with guards. You know she should be safer
5744040	5748540	That's what you won't look like an interloper you guys are on your own. I'm a bad leader
5751600	5753880	Perhaps leave the doctor with the
5755120	5758960	Guards who have been retressed. Yeah, is that possible?
5759200	5762120	to keep an eye on them should they wake and what the
5762520	5768040	Possibly would leave the I would like to follow them and perhaps leave you with the with the with the guards who are on the ground
5768040	5770040	Should they leave me with the guards? Yes
5770160	5772160	Okay
5773120	5775120	That's kind of a shit duty
5776000	5782320	It's it's what I usually do I wind up waiting in the car, but at least I'm in the room this time
5783320	5784640	I
5784640	5788560	Mean why don't why don't we just make sure they don't wake up for a long time. I stun them both again
5789280	5791280	Okay, their bodies twitch
5792600	5794600	I don't want anyone to feel left out
5795240	5802600	This is this is a shadow run. Maybe what we could do is we could put you in a wheelchair
5802600	5804600	I'm the doctor and
5805400	5809080	We could be walking down like I've got my I've got my
5809680	5814760	I've got my my file here, and we're on our way to a process. You know to I love it
5814760	5819360	Have her look at okay, and we'll just we'll just kind of escort you and yeah, yeah
5820800	5822800	Order guard you watch the guards. Yeah
5825480	5828120	Well otherwise I'd be the only one looking like a weirdo
5829960	5835200	Come with to I mean we got two guards a doctor a patient. I mean it's not like anyone's gonna go, but who's that guy?
5837920	5843240	It looks like I can forge some documents do you need those medical records forged yes, okay
5844920	5846920	Just trying to help no I had
5847560	5853120	Did I sound sarcastic? I got really excited about you forging. I got really excited too
5855680	5857680	Montage of him forging documents
5858920	5860920	Okay, is there a music cue
5861360	5865160	Nope, there's no music guy Dustin's getting high. He's like
5866040	5868040	No, there's none
5868040	5870040	And
5874280	5881040	Then documents all right you print some out they're really convincing looking to your eyes I
5882360	5884360	Wish I could whistles. I do that
5885520	5887720	These are some these are some smart-looking ducks
5890840	5892840	You know it
5894520	5896520	What I do
5898920	5900920	All right everybody take a document
5903320	5907920	Even the doctor all right, let's go let's head for the head for the
5909280	5910920	Baldwin's office
5910920	5919820	Alright, you do that you charge out into the hallway and down down the hallway and through a door as you as you open the door
5919820	5924680	You hear the sounds behind you of five or six guards shuffling into the hallway
5924760	5929920	They're just kind of looking around, but they don't seem bothered by your official looking presence
5931680	5938440	You cross out of the hallway and into the cafeteria area you see all sorts of delicious
5939040	5942080	Salads real salads not the fake shit
5943880	5951760	But you're only distracted momentarily you get to the elevator which is next to the stairwell that I mentioned earlier
5955440	5959400	Which one you one of you guys want to help me pick a button
5963760	5967080	Which floor was Baldwin on down down
5968600	5974820	Did you say that you say down yes, all right you want it you want to press it you press it
5980240	5982240	All right the elevator
5984920	5988440	This is so amazing we're fucking nailing this I
5989760	5993920	Think I've been on a lot of shadow runs, and I was like this is fucking butter
5995960	6003460	What's the nice quiet moment in the elevator together, let's get to know each other. Oh, where'd you learn to forge documents like that?
6006600	6012040	Use a practice you're looking really sharp in that that guards off. Oh, thanks. Yeah, I used to work in law enforcement
6012040	6015440	It's part of my dark past. How you doing doc?
6017360	6023800	I'm good. I'm good. Is this a stirring your loins to be back in a medical establishment?
6023800	6027880	I'm back where I need to be man. Thank you. Why'd you why'd you fall from grace?
6032640	6037520	I'm sorry. It's nothing. I want to talk. I'm sorry talk about right now. Sorry
6038600	6040920	If I summon some butterflies, would we all shut up?
6042120	6044120	the fuck
6046200	6049080	I'm not Jeff in case you didn't notice
6056240	6060880	The door opens into a large reception like area with no windows
6060880	6065560	It seems like you may be underground or something it is a reception area
6065840	6071360	So there's a nice receptionist seated at a desk her brown hair in a shirt sharp
6071800	6073040	sharp
6073040	6074280	stylish
6074280	6076280	future style
6076520	6079040	It looks crazy, but normal for you guys
6083360	6089120	She looks up at you expectantly she doesn't say anything though. Hey Mercy, you're usually the
6090480	6093880	Tricky talker. Well, you'll see by these documents. We're supposed to be here. Oh
6095080	6099200	She looks at the documents and inspects them thoroughly. She's like this is great
6101440	6103440	I was just saying that in the elevator
6107960	6112720	But she glances over at hortiguard and it's like that guy who's he
6118040	6121360	Very calmly very stoically I reached inside and pulled out
6122120	6127360	My identification that says Frank Douglas security guard and provide this to her
6127840	6129520	I work
6129520	6133040	Mostly on the ground floor looking for troublesome people
6133720	6135720	Hence the armor
6137240	6139240	Okay
6139720	6143280	Here you do this you do this here, this is correct
6146840	6149440	Use your use your patented
6151360	6156120	Convincing skills and spin a spin a little something. All right, we're supposed to be here
6156480	6158480	I
6158480	6160480	So shut up
6164200	6170680	Yeah, we're just gonna keep going so thanks, oh, okay
6172400	6174400	You push pastor
6180120	6184520	Lady what's the problem? I mean we got just here this guy. He says he works here
6184520	6190960	He gives me an ID that shows he works at the different location. He's a fancy fucking security consultant
6191480	6194080	You're talking your way into a goddamn like
6194760	6196760	Burnt bridge to nowhere, man
6197760	6202520	Aren't you attempt? Excuse me? I'm dr. Friend and
6203800	6205800	this is my patient and
6206840	6212400	He's in serious condition and needs help and we need to get to dr. Brown's office
6212640	6216000	You're gonna let us go and that's the end of it. Oh
6216800	6218800	All right
6220200	6222200	You're the doctor
6228200	6231280	She lets you go through the door into the next room
6235880	6238160	Man I can't I don't read people that well
6238160	6249840	You're in a large circular room. It's it's completely circular. There's a central kind of
6250480	6255680	Also circular area. It looks like it's maybe some sort of shaft or who knows what?
6255760	6262320	But doors are on the outside of this room kind of radiating off like spokes all over the place you smell
6263040	6268640	Formaldehyde and other unsavory smells all over the place. It's heavy in the air down here
6268640	6273920	Must not get too much ventilation down here or something. It's making it smell shitty
6277040	6282320	You see fought six doors excluding the one you came through to the waiting area
6285240	6287560	Let's look for Baldwin Brown's door
6288480	6294560	There's one that says 207 that's the number of Baldwin Brown's office you guys
6303320	6310320	For those just listening to more just throwing Annie's pain this is like a it's a low-budget mic drop
6310320	6312320	I
6316240	6322520	I'll stay in guard in case anybody, you know case that receptionist stuff didn't really work, you know, I'll just zapper
6326280	6329600	Anybody comes through here they won't get much further I'll tell you that for nothing
6329600	6335840	But just as you're saying that you hear the chirp chirp chirping of your comm link
6336040	6341200	Making some noise as if you're receiving some sort of call from an encrypted line
6342880	6347200	Hello, hey, remember me
6353840	6358960	It's Baldwin Baldwin Brown. Oh, you got me my latest job
6360040	6362200	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, wait what?
6363200	6368880	You delivered me to a new employer. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How'd that work out for you? Did they kill you?
6369160	6371160	No, I'm still alive
6371600	6375540	That's great. Yeah, it's better than not being that you're right
6377400	6378760	Anyway
6378760	6383960	It has come it has come to my attention that you're going after some of my research
6383960	6389600	It seems my employer has hired you to steal that research from me for their benefit

6413720	6418040	Don't deliver it to them. Listen Baldwin. If there's a place we could meet and discuss
6418520	6424600	Why we shouldn't do our jobs when you're doing your job and everyone in the world does their job
6424880	6429600	We can maybe we could make up a new job where you pay us to not do our jobs
6429600	6433320	That's also there's a vast American tradition in that it's
6434600	6439640	It's called subsidy, you know, it's I had a I had an uncle who had a friend
6440520	6443320	They literally his job was to not grow corn
6443320	6448080	Of course, these were in the these were the old days before the Pocky clips
6452320	6454320	When there was corn
