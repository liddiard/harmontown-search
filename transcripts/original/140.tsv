386000	401840	please welcome to the stage, please welcome to the stage, please welcome to
432700	439840	Are you blackmailing me are you gonna murder daughter you gonna blackmail me
439840	446680	well a like as the last person didn't blackmail me you know so you're
448360	454040	you are you blackmail I'm about to okay so you're neck-and-neck with a dead
454040	459480	person all right hey let's call the whole thing off I forget we ever let's
459480	463840	just go to Chili's have lunch great so here's the thing I will know if you're
463840	467600	blackmailing me if you say to me look I'll just say this I'll say this I'm a
467600	473960	little I'm behind in the rent I could use 50,000 if let's say $50,000 fell out
473960	478120	of the sky right now I would know exactly what to do with that as opposed
478120	482720	to walking down maybe to the local police department and saying that your
482720	485720	name is dead that what you're gonna do talk to the police okay yes I'm gonna
485720	490040	do give me $50,000 and I won't do it all right well I guess I'm a blackmail you
490040	497360	know that's blackmail let me get my is it in the drawer with the gun I don't I
497360	503720	don't have a gun drawer I have a checkbook drawer like my gun is in it
503720	509900	because it's a it's something it's another thing you use sometimes in an
509900	525780	emergency oh shit all right so now you got a dead guy on the floor of your
525780	532100	apartment bleeding all over the joint right you're dressed as a woman you've
532100	535820	been going under a fake name now you got some fucking fancy footwork to do yeah
535820	540900	now what's what's your first move I would I would do what he did go by a
540900	547380	boson start chopping fuckers up I think now now now Aaron's point is that no no
547380	552340	normal human being could get past that point and my point is that yeah that's
552340	556260	why so many people get caught like the people that like the people that get
556260	562260	away with murder are the people that go that extra mile post murder like they do
562260	565900	horrible things like you've taken a human life and now that person is meat
565900	570260	and now it's but so that's why I'm confused as to when in the courtroom
570260	574780	when they try to they bring that out like and then you know what he did he
574780	578700	tried he tried to keep doing it he tried to finish he tried to get away with it
578700	583980	yeah he took the head and he put it in a bowling bag and he threw it on the roof
583980	588900	not once but twice he missed the first time he said yeah it's hard he had a
588900	594620	difficult time he's trying to get away he didn't walk in here it wasn't he
594620	598740	tried killed the guy and he wanted to get away with it I just said that whole
598740	602300	group the goal because it's like you're talking about a jury of people who are
602300	606860	all supposed to sit there and think oh yeah that is fucked up because if I
606860	610100	killed someone and they're all running a simulation of them killing someone it's
610100	614620	like you're already fucked up people oh I wouldn't be able to do this or that
614620	618940	like tell me more about where your lines are like like like around the
618940	623140	horrible primatological act of extinguishing another primate like oh
623140	627180	what are your what are your pet peeves right after the after the life goes out
627180	632140	of their eyes like these people that like kill someone normally the
632140	640540	neurotypical murderer the heteronormative mainstream murderer the the
640540	648580	1% or not 99% I don't know okay I went too far that the what do they do they
648580	652180	kill somebody kind of in a fit of a you know rage they don't do it for any
652180	657740	reason and then they go oh no oh god I can't believe I did that well what so
657740	660220	I'm supposed to make that person senator and send the other person to the
660220	664540	electric chair the other person is playing chess with life who's this crazy
664540	668020	person that can like kill their best friend because they're in a bad mood and
668020	674100	then be like whoops that person has the hearts and minds of the jury like like
674100	678140	yeah that's dangerous to me the idea is we take it easy on people who confess to
678140	682380	a crime as opposed to people who elaborately try to like hide the fact
682380	685780	yeah I don't know it's like what what better way to keep getting away with
685780	688220	murder than to never murder someone again isn't there a kind of self
688220	695460	policing to a successful murderer well apparently not that's why we're so
695460	699500	fascinated with this guy though I think this guy is a little cuckoo pants oh no
699500	702660	he's not even good at like getting away with it or anything what he's good at is
702660	706900	having loads of money and having really good defense attorneys and that's that's
706900	710980	the thing like the prosecution absolutely screwed that one the guy chopped
710980	714620	somebody up into a hundred pieces and threw him in a trash bag and threw him
714620	717500	in the water and they floated the credit you know you always hear these stories
717500	720220	about like this whole myth of like oh these rich people they can afford these
720220	723180	rich lawyers and then but it's not like their Clarence Darrow like doing these
723180	726780	tricks like whenever you see the real-life incarnation of it it's always
726780	730420	just like the people who work for the prosecution are totally incompetent you
730420	734580	can't believe or understand what they're doing the jury's totally confused and a
734580	739900	rational normal person with an IQ over 100 stands up and represents the killer
739900	744980	and says guys let's get down to brass tacks here's the rules if you if you if
744980	752420	you didn't find a head you can't say that's the rule sorry right no it's
752420	755220	right there in the rules and then everyone's like you slick talking city
755220	759340	lawyer but you are you Dershowitz you got him you gotta make no your fucking
759340	763540	city employees or you know they're idiots they're like these like weird
763540	768660	people what's her name as a Marsha Clark whoever though Jay they fucking blew it
768660	773180	they blew it and they had our friend Cato on the understand he didn't know
773180	776540	anything and they made a big jump out of him and he was better for the defense he
776540	780420	ended up being worse for the prosecution because he didn't know anything he told
780420	784140	me the whole story I hung out with Cato the first time I met him I met him at
784140	791700	the Playboy mansion as one does and we hung out and then we went to Mel's
791700	795660	diner which is it Mel's dinner I think it was still maybe it was back when it was
795660	798860	Ben Frank's maybe it was Mel's dinner then and we sat there and he told me the
798860	803620	whole story he told me the whole day of OJ knocks on his door and says hey uh
803620	808180	Cato you know if you uh if you're gonna use the hot tub you got to you got to
808180	812340	turn it off afterwards and Cato's like I always turned off like I'm here he's
812340	815980	Cato's really smart he remembers everything he sounds like a like a
815980	819860	surfer kind of bimbo he did but he's quite intelligent and super thoughtful
819860	825180	he's like I when I use it I'm like I always turn it off and I knew that I had
825180	829180	and it was like also he never came down to the back house to speak to me so then
829180	832300	he goes okay I'm sorry I thought I did but I didn't like next time you do that
832300	835500	you uh you got to do that but he looked kind of out of sorts and weird so then
835500	838380	he goes away and then a while later he comes back then said hey do you have
838380	841780	change for hundred and at that point Cato's like I just feel like he just
841780	845100	wanted to like prove I look at looking back on it he was just trying to prove
845100	850060	like I was here and he was like no I don't have change for hundred he's broke
850060	854500	ass Cato Cano living in the back house of his place because he's good with kids
854500	859900	and Nicole Simpson loved Cato and he was great with the children OJ was never
859900	865340	there so OJ also he felt like was uh having him followed like Cato felt like
865340	868420	he was pretty sure that he was being watched because he was super jealous of
868420	874820	Nicole who was cheating on him and then he said no I don't have change for
874820	878820	hundred he's like why I want to go to McDonald's and get some food which
878820	882460	sounds like I love by like establishing and Cato doesn't know this cuz he
882460	885420	doesn't know a murders about to happen or two murders and he goes I'll just go
885420	895300	with you I'm hungry too and OJ goes ooh uh oh okay okay okay let's go let's go
895300	897660	let's go let's go let's go let's go and they go to the car and they order the
897660	900740	food and he eats the food and he eats it in the dry like the drive-through they
900740	903940	order the food in the drive-through and instantly eats his filet of fish or
903940	907400	quarter pound or whatever he gets at the drive-through which nobody's ever done
907400	919340	nobody eats it before you leave the parking lot guilty sir so it tells me
919340	923420	the whole story and then and then is a friend of his he's good friends with
923420	927300	Nicole she nearly gets decapitated and his other guy the waiter wasn't
927300	931220	Ron Goldman he gets murdered so as he's telling this story at this diner at 4
931220	936420	a.m. a guy comes over to the table and goes like hey Kato Kato hey yo man um I
936420	940460	have an old-school OJ Simpson Jersey signed by him how much you think that's
940460	947540	worth okay does like I don't know man is it whoa whoa whoa sorry asshole and the
947540	951260	guy walked away I go you just told me about your friend being nearly the
951260	954980	capitated and then some guy walks up and says how much is an OJ thing and
954980	959540	called you an asshole and he goes it happens every day once a day for ten
959540	963820	years I remember back that because people felt like he was just a party to
963820	967580	this whole circus so like I remember back then like him saying that people
967580	971620	would you know drive by and yell stuff out the window that was like years after
971620	975020	but it was like they associated him with all he was was a guy that happened to
975020	979220	hear a thump on the wall and he was he was around when it happened didn't know
979220	982260	anything and they made him a hostile witness he's the only guy I ever saw it
982260	986020	like even even Jack Black who's like probably like like with the time that I
986020	989300	was I'll be hanging out in public with Jack Black is probably the most that's
989300	992420	probably the most famous guy I've ever been in public with it at the time of
992420	996580	their the height of their fame and like height of like people just strangers
996580	1001720	coming up to Jack and going like are you famous and Jack like no because if you
1001720	1005340	don't yeah and then I'm going yeah you are and then they're like like can I can
1005340	1008940	I get a picture with you and Jack going half the time okay and half the time no
1009460	1013140	and then but then in either case they come up later and go like kid calm
1013140	1017340	school the rock or whatever like the yells some shit in him but the Kato
1017340	1023100	like like the one time we were out like he was singing karaoke and people were
1023100	1029580	just walking up putting their arm around him like he was like a statue and going
1029580	1034460	like oh taking a picture and then walking away and looking at the phone
1034460	1038580	and going hilarious like five feet away from him and he's just like playing with
1038580	1050060	the queen of hearts I guess I've become a piece of furniture in a cosmic game by
1050060	1055500	god in a incredibly unique situation he was just a celebrity for being on trail
1055500	1060260	also hilariously had no idea what he was supposed to do why he was even called as
1060260	1064420	a witness and then ended up black people hated him black people loved him white
1064420	1067940	people hated him white people love like it was no he was on every side of every
1067940	1074180	coin and what's what's truly tragic about Kato is that he's one of the most
1074180	1079100	likable people you'll ever fucking meet he you can't not like Kato Kalin
1079100	1082220	because he's such a sweetheart and if you ever saw him around children you'd
1082220	1088100	be like like he should he's no it sounds like it sounds like you're talking about
1088100	1094260	like a terrier or something but he is like a cherry he has he has terrier like
1094260	1097860	energy and he will entertain the world's children all he just runs around
1097860	1101100	the pool all day long and just like and people are like oh can you please just
1101100	1106260	babysit my children for the whole time well now you got us worried again it's
1106260	1110780	not worrisome he's not gonna do anything bad I know we're just programmed when we
1110780	1117900	hear the word children we all think about fucking them what's happened to us
1118140	1121820	it's what happened to you don't act like it's don't act like this not the case
1121820	1126740	with you hey you ever you ever you ever not brush your teeth and then you're
1126740	1129780	like leaving and then you're like oh shit I didn't brush my teeth and then
1129780	1133460	you just drink something gross like coffee cuz you're like well my breath
1133460	1139300	will be terrible but then but someone will think oh he drank coffee food for
1139300	1147440	thought food for nightmares like too far from the toothpaste I'll just drink
1147440	1153400	some gross coffee I'll just double down on being disgusting well they won't go
1153400	1156760	yeah cuz it's somehow worse if you're if you have bad breath and then it's like
1156760	1162040	the bad the bad part of your breath is like your entrails you know so you just
1162040	1166200	I had a computer teacher in high school who was awesome she was so great but boy
1166200	1170280	the coffee and cigarette breath combined to make something just I'm really phobic
1170280	1173680	about it that's what's one of many reasons why I don't I don't make eye
1173680	1177080	contact when I'm talking to people I try to like look at the floor because I just
1177120	1181280	like you get a blast of bad breath in your face it's like you know and then the
1181280	1183920	other person no one's gonna tell you you don't know if you know why wouldn't you
1183920	1187000	tell anybody and that like every once in a while happens I'm on the receiving
1187000	1190200	end of it and I always think that poor person because they don't know why I'm
1190200	1194840	why I just became 10% more aloof because it's not like anyone ever goes well you
1194840	1198320	know you just kind of like you smell it and then you just kind of like you know
1198320	1203200	you sort of like you just sort of work here you sort of pull spiritually back
1203200	1206540	from the whole thing you kind of keep your head in the same place but you just
1206540	1210300	like kind of hate them and like slowly like like like they just feel you know
1210300	1213340	that person doesn't know sometimes you talk to somebody who is just like like
1213340	1216140	clinically bad breath like they don't think they could have people could have
1216140	1219820	like halitosis they could have like a bad thing some people have that with
1219820	1224500	their armpits some people have that with their butts there are everybody has that
1224500	1231460	with their butts so it's something to think about get off your high horse
1231460	1238140	hashtag stinking is not a choice and I will send a hundred dollars to the Red
1238140	1243780	Cross okay I was I was I was in variety I was on the cover of variety with Joel
1243780	1248300	McHale this last week oh yeah and yeah little little dream come true I got to
1248300	1255820	mark this one off my my non hack version of a bucket list the hilarious variety
1255820	1259500	headline with great abbreviation well it did say it's I didn't get this for a
1259500	1264140	really long time it said it was a picture of me and Joel and then it says
1264140	1274500	imperfect harmony what's not to get there well I didn't I was like look is
1274500	1278420	that the I and the M and imperfect were in red and then the perfect was in white
1278420	1282340	that's that's that's needless yeah because I was so was like yeah for a
1282340	1287180	long time was like oh imperfect harmony the set would be a phrase like no one
1287180	1291700	really so they're trying to italicize the M yeah it was like in more like
1291700	1298460	mmm perfect harmony and like you know building on that old chestnut perfect
1298460	1306300	harmony like it's like okay that's a musical term but like I mean anyways the
1306300	1315980	thank you for putting me on your cover I have some notes I'm sure whoever wrote
1315980	1319380	that headline will agree with me that they that was not their finest hour the
1319380	1325260	yeah it sounds like a protracted meeting went on about that I just said some 19
1325260	1330940	year old kid that has to sit in this cubicle and he's like Dan Harman God
1330940	1336940	damn it Dan Dan good time don't don't just please the Harman
1336940	1349020	McHale's Navy Harman oh my god Irish Irish delight there's a paragraph in it
1349020	1357380	this is Dan Harman finishes his breakfast of peanut butter filled pretzels before
1357380	1366380	hopping on his segue which he purchased to conserve energy dash his own that's a
1366380	1372980	good lead and it's I would continue reading that article that's not the
1372980	1377260	opener that's just like if you if you write that's how you start it you start
1377260	1382100	with that one this is this is the things I have no reason I've no I have no right
1382100	1387740	to complain about section but like like like if you write an article about me
1387740	1393540	here's the start of my complaint like it would seem that if you don't mention my
1393540	1399340	fat gut like you get fined by some kind of press union or something like like
1399340	1403180	and it's always like the last two like I was in Hollywood Reporter and it's all
1403180	1408220	there's his visible punch his his protruding punch his pronounced punch
1408220	1414980	bulges from beneath his sweater as he slovenly sucks up a bowl of skittles
1414980	1425420	downing globs of frog meat a timid slave clad Leia struggles against her
1425420	1432780	chains as he gurgles his desires in a language only only worms could
1432780	1440420	understand and I know the battle of the sexes is over and the men won and we
1440420	1443580	don't have anything to complain about but man you just don't see that in
1443580	1454500	articles about just physical disco her calf muscles could use some work but how
1454500	1459340	much hell you'd catch if you also writers not actors I know that's what I'm
1459340	1462900	saying you can describe Shonda rhymes in an article about her do you know how
1462900	1466460	much trouble you would get into like if it's just like like like clinically
1466460	1471980	scrutinizing her like giving a giving a description of her or any you know that
1471980	1475100	seems a bit harsh but like part of what's for sale of someone's writing an
1475100	1479660	article about you is the fact that you're willfully like you're just you
1479660	1485100	like and part of that is like the you know what you see part of part of what's
1485100	1488740	for sale here is what you're looking at what you're picking on and that big fat
1488740	1497180	nerd shit the big big shitty thick shit face waddles into the room with shit
1497180	1502100	coming out of his face what are you gonna be another hard day in the writers
1502100	1506260	room what do you think would have been different let's say going back same
1506260	1510300	behavior same attitudes towards if I looked like Steve Levitan will be

1695340	1700620	proved it it's harder to sit down and rap it's it's or you know I think you
1700620	1706500	get more out of your little rap baby dance there's more energy in the little
1706500	1712020	kickyfoot baby dance that you do what do you think Spencer I think there's
1712020	1718220	definitely a lot more energy in your kickyfoot baby dance Spencer if you've
1718220	1721860	given any thought to getting away with the perfect murder oh I think we all
1721860	1726660	have Jeff the way you say that makes me think that you thought about it just a
1726660	1730580	little bit more well I mean I don't know I think that of course you have to
1730580	1734700	fantasize about it only for like yeah academic reasons it's like thinking about
1734700	1737820	jumping out of windows it's not like you're gonna jump out of windows it's
1737820	1740860	just you got to think about it to know you're not gonna do it I went through a
1740860	1743940	whole phase right I watched forensic files and all those shows for like a
1743940	1747460	million years I was I was unemployed and I was on the Atkins diet and I would
1747460	1751740	watch Colombo and forensic files and eat summer sausage and cheese and just
1751740	1757580	and just watched my bank account going from 12,000 to 11,000 there was like
1757580	1761620	this clock but that Milwaukee at 12 like I thought I was gonna move back to
1761620	1764900	Milwaukee and they'd be like yay you were born here so you could wash dishes
1764900	1768900	here no that wouldn't have happened anyways so I was in denial I was just
1768900	1771100	watching a lot of forensic files because I guess I guess that's what
1771100	1773780	happens when you're in a bad point in your career you watch intervention and
1773780	1780340	like murder shows because you're like man that person's fucked but what I
1780340	1784900	learned from the forensic files thing is that basically if you really want to
1784900	1788380	murder people and just never get caught you gotta have a boat you gotta have a
1788380	1796020	boat because to have a boat that you own and a harbor master that is asleep
1796020	1800220	at the wheel yeah maybe I'm sure these days like the security cameras at the
1800220	1803100	docks you know if they see you getting on a boat with someone that doesn't come
1803100	1807460	back that's probably a big part of it now excuse my burping but the but yeah
1807460	1810500	it worked a lot like Bob Durst burped when he when they when he was shown the
1810500	1815860	handwriting I'm sure there's a couple people that have to have to catch up and
1815860	1821340	it's just such a good you know you don't want to deny him a morsel there's
1821340	1826660	a couple it's it's those little little people I do this for wait for the
1826660	1833220	burping teaser I did have I mentioned before I was reading a good as a news
1833220	1838340	week like I don't know 15 20 years ago and another page like four or six or
1838340	1841820	eight of news weeks was always like a bunch of like quotes of the week and it
1841820	1847140	was a if I'm repeating myself on the podcast and forgive me but it was a LAPD
1847140	1851540	homicide detective and they'd found a body or two buried up in Angela's
1851540	1855780	National Forest that was like an unsolved crime and like a cold case or
1855780	1860580	whatever and a reporter asked the detective this like seasoned salty old
1860580	1863900	homicide detective said do you think there's a lot of bodies buried up here
1863900	1867740	and he said please if I asked every dead body out here to stand up it would look
1867740	1873820	like Venice Beach he's like this is where you go bury people and even what
1873820	1880500	one of the dead bodies would have a turban and roller skates one of them
1880500	1889580	would be spray-painted silver the rest of them would be drawing the other half of
1889580	1895860	them Spencer would you would you would you okay so if you killed someone on an
1895860	1901860	accident I'm gonna assume if any of us killed someone on an accident we would
1901860	1905140	we wouldn't try to get away with it we would we would turn ourselves in it was
1905140	1908460	an accident describe the accident like it like a crime of passion or you you
1908460	1912660	accidentally on the accident right I mean like like you got angry and push
1912660	1915420	somebody and they fell over hit their head on a table and cut themselves open
1915420	1920180	and blood to death the accident or like you hit them with a car by accident like
1920180	1923420	like you didn't see them and like like well I guess either of those cases I'm
1923420	1927460	I want to get I want to I want to know I want to get us to a place where we
1927460	1933100	killed somebody and we want to try to get away and this is conspiracy you're
1933100	1942340	talking let's pick a specific person no I mean because because obviously you
1942340	1947180	kind of bounce off of the thing I mean we if I were if I were somehow you know
1947180	1950420	indirectly like responsible for someone's death I would I would
1950420	1953860	immediately go I would think to myself well one thing's for sure doing anything
1953860	1959020	other than the honest confessional like immediate turn myself in thing is just
1959020	1962700	gonna get me in trouble I'm gonna be but I'm trying to think of like if I'm
1962700	1967820	really in a in a place where I'm like fuck man I I gotta get away with this
1967820	1971620	murder if I crossed a line I know for me because you watch these things you watch
1971620	1975180	these shows and you watch people in interrogation rooms I think you have to
1975180	1981380	be a certain kind of crazy to get away with lying about it you have to be so
1981380	1986020	cold in some way I don't think I could actually get away with dissembling about
1986020	1988900	it I think that I would have to turn myself in because I would never ever get
1988900	1992620	away with lying and I'm a professional liar I have an actor that's all we do
1992620	1996260	for a living I don't think I could pull it off I would never be able to like all
1996260	1999500	that stuff like the the time and date stuff like all the cops ask you where
1999500	2002420	were you then and where were you now and also I can't even get that stuff
2002420	2006380	straight like in reality so I know if I killed somebody then I'd have to create
2006380	2010540	this timeline that's that's the mistake I think right there you don't do that if
2010540	2013300	your stories down pat I think the regular human being doesn't know what
2013300	2016220	they had for dinner last night and doesn't know where they were yeah but but
2016220	2020020	you'd have to forget that you killed somebody you have to like leave that out
2020020	2025340	of your like natural pattern there has to be there's a big block of like not
2025340	2029700	knowings a bunch of stuff so you have to fabricate stuff to fill that okay so you
2029700	2032940	don't have a boat you drive a Prius you do it's hard to get somebody into the
2032940	2037940	middle of the city yeah how do you yeah Spencer you seem to have given us some
2037940	2041860	some some idle thoughts what do you think yeah I mean it well it all all
2041860	2046740	depends right I mean what are you is it a crime of passion are you are you
2046740	2052180	planning this do you have like a Rube Goldberg set up in your study or well
2052180	2055860	can we just say why don't you pick one you let's say it's second degree it's
2055860	2060100	not first degree it's a second degree homicide well you've got to go you know
2060100	2064620	you just the old no I read about recently you could cook down a pack of
2064620	2071060	cigarettes into a into a nicotine paste put it on a doorknob and people touch it
2071060	2076060	nicotine goes into their bodies and kills them what we do try one of those
2076060	2082180	maybe I don't know it was in a it was in an old you know military handbook
2082180	2097620	supposedly they probably read that thing yeah well I mean it's a lot of
2097620	2101380	nicotine I mean if you took all of the nicotine in a pack of cigarettes at once
2101380	2106140	you'd be you'd be in bad shape it's like thank you for smoking you know that
2106140	2114540	quality comedy I'm asking about like just take my word for it you're in a
2114540	2121340	situation where there's a body on the floor of your home and you you turning
2121340	2125220	yourself in you you've decided is not an option well I'd hope there's no blood
2125220	2132220	everywhere well I mean I'll leave let's say there's no blood but there is a 200
2132220	2137940	pound you see you got a breaking bad that shit you know with the plastic tub
2137940	2142300	and the acid you could get fucking acid man you could get acid a Home Depot but
2142300	2145420	then there's purchase this there's records of this cameras of you in Home
2145420	2152020	Depot buying that you know you find a hobo hobo's talk Spencer hobos don't
2152020	2157140	talk to nobody let you well hobos talk but if you watch Empire hobos only
2157140	2162900	talking cryptic like Egyptian riddles they're like threshold guardians for
2162900	2169820	police no but one-eyed Jack crows at midnight well that's why it depends I
2169820	2173340	mean I'd hope if you were gonna murder someone you put in the due diligence to
2173340	2177100	you know go cruising around parking lots until you find parking lot without
2177100	2181100	security cameras then you cruise around find a Home Depot without cameras and
2181100	2185940	then you go in and you use cash only to buy muriatic acid you know I mean we're
2185940	2189060	talking about getting away with murder here it's not just oh I killed someone
2189060	2193140	let me go find out the nearest Home Depot is now we're talking about first
2193140	2196140	degree you thought about this before you killed the person we're talking about oh
2196140	2200700	shit I got a dead body I haven't scouted out every cameraless Home Depot
2200700	2204540	well it's a bad move to just randomly kill someone well I don't you guys are
2204540	2208220	going back and forth though we finally got him to start talking about how to
2208220	2214420	get rid of the body let's not distract him I want to know how to find a Home
2214420	2217900	Depot with no security cameras this is where we start to get into lawsuit
2217900	2222860	territory it's all for educational purposes any anyone acting on this is
2222860	2230300	not doing anything we condone okay that's out of the way I mean how you
2230300	2233660	wouldn't be able to know there's security cameras everywhere you know
2233660	2237620	you say that but when we were in Texas I was finding an awfully lots of areas
2237620	2241940	with no security cameras so I think it's doable I mean maybe maybe not in
2241940	2247220	cities berg Los Angeles where are you gonna go get mariatic acid without a
2247220	2252060	camera pointed right at your face I mean a lot of places I don't know ace
2252060	2264980	hardware on High Street for instance maybe I don't know yeah so you're gonna
2264980	2268340	go acid in the tub there's yeah I mean there's different ways to do it I mean
2268340	2272380	well maybe ass in the tub or you do the little like what the Mexican warlords
2272380	2276500	are doing where you just burn them in like gas in an oil drum you know
2276500	2283820	something like that well you got to get away with it that's the whole point if
2283820	2288420	you're not gonna do it just go to the police don't you say we're worried
2288420	2291680	about handguns we're worried about nuclear power we're worried about the
2291680	2294220	environment we're worried about all these things that we think are ticking
2294220	2300580	down to midnight well relatively but like this at some point someone might
2300580	2306420	invent just like a like disintegration ray like that you can just point at
2306420	2310980	shit and make disappear like don't you think that the entire justice system is
2310980	2314900	based on the fundamental unspoken assumption that it's that you have to do
2314900	2319780	certain things to cover up a crime if what if people start to figure out like
2319780	2323900	something gets invented that's like oh this this handy-dandy little doozy doodle
2323920	2329340	like it disintegrates matter it turns it back back into Adams and they and we're
2329340	2334380	like yay garbage is gonna go away but then meanwhile it's like um yay habeas
2334380	2339140	corpus is impossible if you can trace a firearm you should be able to trace the
2339140	2343940	disintegration ray way better yeah you need some heavy bureaucracy if you had a
2343940	2347060	I mean even if I don't know man I don't know if the founding fathers would have
2347060	2354740	wanted that I think that I mean we can't even clear we can't even clone
2354740	2358520	people though like if a disintegration ray shows up I mean you can believe
2358520	2362060	there's gonna be some moratoriums or something yeah no I mean we're gonna be
2362060	2364820	alarmed about it but I'm saying it's gonna be a catastrophic thing like we've
2364820	2369980	had firearms which are basically just a they're just like a screwdriver that
2369980	2375700	killing you know throw baby screwdrivers at something it's like it's just a tool
2375700	2380540	it just happens to be a very dangerous tool like like it's designed to like
2380540	2384780	put holes in people which tends to kill them and and that's a big deal and
2384780	2388380	that's been around for 300 or more years and we're still trying to figure it out
2388380	2392860	but like there was a day when that shit got invented no I take that back there
2392860	2396060	wasn't a day when that shit got invented and it was back when we were pretty
2396060	2400860	barbaric as a people anyway like you're the first guns were just like extra fast
2400860	2406420	arrows like why deal with the length of an arrow when you can shorten it down to
2406420	2416940	an arrow lit now with smoke but but but like next Wednesday someone at MIT could
2416940	2420820	go hey I invented a wand that you tap tap your dog with and it disappears
2420820	2426580	probably not probably not it probably requires more difficulty than I'm
2426580	2429220	thinking the science let the conservation of energy and stuff like
2429220	2432340	that like that would be hard to just eliminate something yeah I mean don't
2432340	2437740	worry about that it's not really that's all I worry about oh by the way I got to
2437740	2442300	meet and be on stage with professor Brian Cox the infinite monkey cage you
2442300	2447540	know the English physicist from CERN from the Large Hadron Collider and we
2447540	2451100	were talking and I was telling him my ghost stories in my 9-11 dream you know
2451100	2457140	and he proved that neither that ghosts can't exist because of the second law
2457140	2470140	of thermodynamics and that which is no ghosts more or less and then that that
2470140	2475500	my dream my my my one and only panic attack on them at the exact moment that
2475500	2481780	the second plane hit the building was simply a non-zero some coincidence it
2481780	2485660	was just simply like he goes I you how many dreams that do you have a night how
2485660	2490380	many do you remember as it loads and he goes it's statistically inevitable that
2490380	2495140	they resemble things that happen uh-huh because it's a number larger than zero
2495140	2499300	it's never a zero right and in a way that made me feel like it was kind of
2499300	2501620	liberating and then he also talked about as I like what do you think about the
2501620	2505140	end of the universe and he said it's just going to cool off and it's just
2505140	2509500	going to hit a uniform cool temperature and then that will be that so there's a
2509500	2512340	million versions of us there's an infinite versions of us but there's
2512340	2516260	only one version of this there's only one version of what we're happy what's
2516260	2520060	happening right now and we get one shot at it and when it's over that's the end
2520060	2524140	of it and I thought that's that's kind of lovable it's gonna cool off and don't
2524140	2531940	want into into a into a into a cool room temperature of space will have a very
2531940	2535900	low cold temperature and that will be that there are even black holes will die
2535900	2542020	everything will die I'm not gonna die you your scientist friend forgot about
2542020	2544740	one thing the power of rock and roll
2544740	2562300	rock and roll yeah rock and roll is here to stay yeah that was so fucking rock
2562300	2571940	man that was so rock it was a wrap you can't you can't cool that that off it
2571940	2576060	doesn't matter how how much entropy there is in the universe that's that's
2576060	2580860	something my gut tells me which speaks louder than a lot of voices just just
2580860	2590340	just ask the press his prodigious fucking fat inner tube of a gut ripples
2590340	2598940	as he explains that he's the victim of you don't have the rippling kind of gut
2598940	2602900	you have that kind of ex-football coach very firm that kind of like it used to
2602900	2606460	be muscle it would sound like a watermelon like give me a thump on Mike

2931680	2935560	like well let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet because I don't remember
2935560	2939160	what was going on like they were like something about like there's some

3013540	3016900	supervisor has a has a Twitter account and I cooked him up on there and then I
3016900	3021460	explained to the department the situation which is that Annie has to be
3021460	3024860	dressed a certain way for the finale so and they're okay with that yeah they
3024860	3030500	don't care I don't care about the show was it what's the what's the bullwhip
3030500	3033820	chicken I was about can you can you spoil the bullwhip chicken scene for us
3033820	3037460	no it's not those I was using place because if I said the real things it'd
3037460	3041940	be like really like I I can't I can't say the real thing so those are
3041940	3046260	placeholders for actual actual things that you made up just as placeholders
3046260	3055540	well yeah yeah you like it improvisation improvisation is except
3055540	3058500	you're not supposed to be yeah I'm not supposed to be making things up and then
3058500	3061260	everyone the thing that kills me is that everyone underneath me who's like well
3061260	3065140	if you would give me a script with two days notice I'd be able to make the best
3065140	3071500	chicken for you or the best bullwhip but then they get it an hour before we
3071500	3077940	shoot they're like okay I guess I'll have my cousin run out and buy a shitty
3077940	3082100	bullwhip on Hollywood Boulevard like like you know like they're they I make
3082100	3089680	them look bad that's why I'm fired fire myself nobody left to fire me Harmon
3089680	3095140	you're fired but you feel like you owe it to us or as a story structure person to
3095140	3099260	get fired a third time off a show yeah but it should be me that's the that's
3099260	3105540	the third act I fire myself Harmon you're fired I'm fired I quit no you're
3105540	3111620	fired turns out that's the same thing yeah fire firing yourself is quitting
3111620	3118140	but because we need somebody's got to be responsible you know and I've come to
3118140	3124060	terms with the fact that I'm I'm just too talented to do anything do you
3124060	3127620	foresee in the future like you working for a big like like major network and
3127860	3131860	major corporation again or is that I foresee myself under a bridge eating
3131860	3140660	Aaron's leg because I tricked her into into killing the weakest dog while I
3140660	3145820	came up behind her with a bowling pin and we're in Philadelphia or somewhere
3145820	3150100	like where you read in the paper has no taxes and we're like I'm like picking
3150100	3154380	crystal meth out of my beard and we're making videos about fucking roof Rupert
3154380	3160180	Murdoch and I if you want if you want to know how I picture my future follow
3160180	3167140	Evie Evie Quaid on Twitter how many followers are they up to oh I mean it's
3167140	3170980	gotta be less than 400 that's amazing to me like that no one else is interested
3170980	3175020	in this it really is I mean I posted a link I posted a link on the Twitter and
3175020	3178620	I was like this is the most important thing in the world right now but this is
3178620	3182740	Randy Quaid and his wife yeah fucking they're fucking of the dogs going off
3182740	3186460	it's pretty great continue to issue communiques and things like that they're
3186460	3191740	trapped in Canada Hillary Clinton took their passport they're they're they're
3191740	3195460	they're what do you call it they're not expatriates they're they're depatriates
3195460	3201260	or something fugitives they've yeah they can't get back into America and they're
3201260	3206380	just they're sitting there I really it's a it's a story that makes you I think
3206380	3210580	incredibly in love it's just like a greatest love they better be like true
3210580	3215020	romance I feel like a very healthy relationship as relationships go I don't
3215020	3219660	I mean I don't know of making YouTube videos of having sex with your wife
3219660	3224380	wearing a mask of Rupert Murdoch is necessarily a healthy relationship
3224380	3229380	practice unless you're both smiling while you're doing it like that they're
3229380	3232260	not like he's not he's not like you're wearing it wrong and she's not like
3232260	3235700	you're fucking me wrong she like they're both like on the same page like
3235700	3243140	that's hard I'll take that if you're wearing a mask while you're fucking do
3243140	3246340	you think you're smiling while you're wearing that or do you let the mask do
3246340	3253260	the talking so when I worked at Disneyland I asked all the Goofy's all
3253260	3256960	the Mickey's all the minis all the chips and dales I asked him like like
3256960	3260220	when you're like smile you're smiling for picture are you smiling behind the
3260220	3265420	mask like no you do that for the first couple days when you hear smile we
3265740	3268820	smile they realize at the end of the day your face hurts you're tired and you're
3268820	3272460	hot and you're sweaty and they keep the kids keep kicking in the nuts and there's
3272460	3275820	nothing to smile about and after a while this will not work for the for the
3275820	3280260	podcast but on camera you ask any Goofy if you ever meet anybody that's a
3280260	3283860	costumed character at a major theme park ask him what they look like when
3283860	3293900	they're taking photos and it's just super super joyless and sad so I would
3293900	3298220	like to think that she is smiling while wearing the Rupert Murdoch mask also why
3298220	3302780	is there Rupert Murdoch mask because my first question watch this movie man they
3302780	3309980	mean they made it clearly out of a some magazine and printed it off the
3309980	3315380	internet yeah there's a lot of stuff about it that if you want to let it will
3315380	3321060	make you very sad however as a person who's going to couples therapy and like
3321060	3324780	is in love with his wife and one and learning like how how you know the
3324780	3328740	delicate art of like making a relationship work between two people
3328740	3333140	like these guys have been been you know they've been they've been a healthy
3333140	3338500	couple for like 20 this is more healthy I don't I don't think it follows I mean
3338500	3341860	just because they aren't mad at each other doesn't make it a healthy
3341860	3345220	relationship it's just well that's true but Bonnie and Clyde had fights between
3345220	3350980	bank robberies but their bank robbery didn't make them unhealthy if Bonnie and
3350980	3355860	Clyde robbed your bank as they were leaving you lost that guy it was you
3355860	3359700	madam officer whoever that was if Bonnie and Clyde robbed your bank robbery is
3359700	3363780	the first sign of unhealthiness yeah how can we not make this differentiation
3363780	3368000	here was that the of a couple if a couple murders your dog and they're both
3368000	3375780	like like sweetie get the tail and then the cops go like could you describe the
3375780	3380220	couple that murdered your dog I'd be like well they were very healthy like
3380220	3384340	they they got along they were on the same team like some say they got along
3384340	3388340	so well that they murdered my dog yeah yeah and and I would want the cops to
3388340	3391460	catch this couple I'd be like I hope you give him the electric chair and and and
3391460	3394180	because but and because I want you to catch them I want you to take this
3394180	3397140	unique descriptor with you so you recognize them at Grand Central Station
3397140	3404020	they get along great they're very much in love don't don't don't don't bother
3404020	3409900	your time with the healthy spouse deter the other the other one from killing a
3409900	3413620	dog and robbing a bank I don't know I think wouldn't you want to your as a
3413620	3418260	healthy spouse or or or you know significant other you would want the
3418260	3421780	person to not do things that would lend you in jail well so if Copernicus his
3421780	3427660	wife had been like why don't you stop redesigning the solar system
3428340	3432500	oh because that was that a healthy is that a healthy relationship you're
3432500	3437300	waiting redesigning the solar system with killing your dog yes I am and here
3437300	3440340	oh and here's the other thing about cutting up cutting up bodies and all
3440340	3446140	this stuff again I hate to beat a dead horse but like like or or take a horse
3446140	3451220	and then yeah but again there's people in the courtroom they go like and then
3451220	3458020	you know what he did he took us off and he cut the arm off and then he cut the
3458020	3462620	body up and he took the liver and he put it in a bag and I'm like sounds like a
3462620	3472260	doctor I've been saying this for years these people need to be watched well
3472260	3475380	you're saying the suspect is not a doctor that doctors are all suspects
3475380	3478580	because they don't I'm saying as I've said before the difference between a
3478580	3485220	doctor and a serial killer is a support system it's just money that's it but
3485220	3490060	doctors don't cut up alive or they don't kill yes they totally kill I cut up live
3490660	3496820	I got him I got him they don't a doctor doesn't go to Home Depot and buy a bow
3496820	3502620	saw they don't have to they're supported they're licensed the guy the murderer
3502620	3504820	wouldn't have done it if he had a governor that's what the cops are like
3504820	3507860	I can't believe he did that I'm like man what would you do if you weren't a cop
3507860	3511340	and you had to get rid of a body like a cop can just dump them off on the curb
3511340	3519020	and call his cop friend yeah I got another one I'm southern cuz I'm a cop
3519820	3523180	character I wasn't gonna weigh in exactly where your lawyer character was
3523180	3531060	right little Jewish little Jewish you know wait who was just the lawyer was
3531060	3537020	just a little bit wait your lawyer character a little oh they took the arm
3537020	3546340	anything okay this is a this is a reason to do things to people this is the way
3546340	3552420	to treat a mother all right I'll cop to that okay I let I let the magma of
3552420	3558580	pre-existing anti-semitism of which we are all apart you're more guilty than I
3558580	3563980	am in that sense and it seeped up into my lawyer my improvised lawyer character he
3563980	3567220	was a little Jewish a little stereotypical you went a little Lucas on

3809140	3813160	course like just like best friends did you ever see Monsters Inc to the way
3813160	3816820	that they met like they weren't they were not good friends to begin with you
3816820	3823540	know that's that that's the way you are in the post cool you you know you better
3823540	3827740	believe it you reunited with Alexander do flicky was he like a successful R&B
3827740	3831660	singer or did you kind of rescue him from no we actually neither of us were
3831660	3835580	neither of us were even hooked into the R&B scene you know what I'm saying it's
3836300	3842700	but it's like my passion for rowing like as it as it started to stop equating
3842700	3849860	with a you know ability to out row people physically what we noticed is
3849860	3854500	that Alexander's ability to call me forward bring the best out of me
3854500	3859580	spiritually psychically like it lent itself more to the hip-hop scene than to
3859580	3866020	rowing where we were losing like consistently like and if you listen to
3866020	3869420	my lyrics what you'll find in my heart is I'm not that good a rapper but I'm a
3869420	3875220	better rapper than I was at rowing a boat and Alexander's always been good at
3875220	3880980	telling me what to do and and that I'm doing good he's an encourager what's it
3880980	3885460	called that the coxswain of the boats of the most of those coxswain the guy that
3885460	3888100	he was he the coxswain and when they yelled out yeah he was the coxswain yeah
3888260	3894100	they call him the cox swing swain swain swain I believe right coxswain cox
3894100	3899820	cox sin cox sin cox it's been spelled cox swain there's cox in cox like boat
3899820	3906500	swain is bosom a gun a gun soul is a gunnel or whatever you know they shorten
3906500	3915220	things so rich people shit I'm surprised that you wouldn't know all this rowing
3915220	3920140	terminology I was a scholarship student personally I was there you know trying
3920140	3923740	to do my best turn my family around what was the school again I'm sorry this was
3923740	3932420	University of Georgia Holland Brook what was your major again noted you
3932420	3939020	majored in Notre Dame yeah cuz they have a pretty famous Notre Dame study of
3939020	3943620	school there at the University of Georgia you learn all about it I couldn't
3943620	3946700	get into Notre Dame originally and then this program came up and said you could
3946700	3951740	get a scholarship my family none of them ever went to school so like the pressure
3951740	3955820	was on I had to do right represent my family you know the way we had dealt
3955820	3960220	with in the street had to turn it around and so I went there did you graduate
3960220	3964560	knowing a lot about Notre Dame I will well I dropped out eventually the studies
3964560	3970180	were more difficult than rapping and and rowing like who's spending most I was
3970180	3975060	spending most of my time rowing and they asked me not to to study more about
3975060	3980220	Notre Dame but I was also then I was very focused on rowing and I said please
3980220	3983780	let me focus on this and they said okay but you have to be good at it and I was
3983780	3987740	like okay and then I started to get more interested in rapping because the rowing
3987740	3990500	was not working out
3990500	4000880	Alexander I didn't realize that you were here with us every friendship has its
4000880	4008380	ups and downs yeah but you know you know we do we do all right it's one town we
4008380	4013000	went through a phase where we were living together in the same apartment
4013000	4020340	one bedroom we only had two plates for the macaroni he would leave his out he
4020340	4025500	leave his macaroni plate out on the coffee table yeah but you would too yeah
4025500	4032860	but two times two don't make up for what you do that's true you guys do seem to
4032860	4036100	compliment each other pretty well yeah well you get through something like that
4036100	4040500	and it's like you you're good seems like a pretty healthy relationship yeah well
4040500	4056020	you know you got married oh that was my salvation about me my better half we
4056020	4066100	have the worst podcast why are you here why are there nine cameras why are
4066100	4077100	people allowed to spend money it's so irresponsible or is it the most is it so
4077100	4082340	responsible I don't want to be in another one fuck yeah I just keep
4082340	4084940	thinking I keep watching it through Lance bangs eyes because he's here
4084940	4089820	tonight needs brought his kids and he's he's he's funny and smart and
4089820	4094700	interesting and like lives in Portland and stuff and I don't think he and I
4094700	4100340	can't imagine him enjoying this I'm not fishing for he probably left a long time
4100340	4106180	ago after I after I talked about he's just a friend of ours he's kind of I
4106180	4110140	would call him comedy royalties if he's a comedy director guy he's like he's
4110140	4115340	done a lot of a music video work like a lot of fenty all that all the people who
4115340	4119820	you would be lance are you here cool enough to leave is he around he's he's
4119820	4123500	probably shy also even if he was here did you know when I ever come up do you
4123500	4130460	and just chat for a second okay yeah he's he's more of a he's a he's an older
4130460	4133900	soul than me discretion is the better part of valor I think he's just pretty
4133900	4137820	yeah he's he's he's with his kids out in the comic book store explaining to them
4137820	4143420	like what why dismemberment is not funny and they're like we know why it's not
4143420	4150900	funny we were in the same show you were that point was made very clear he has a
4150900	4155020	his wonderful kids he has a very healthy relationship with food a little
4155020	4159340	brunch with them in Portland so he's not killing dogs and robbing banks it's one
4159340	4162100	of those one of those dads that their families one of those families that
4162100	4164380	makes you want to have kids right away because it's like oh they're perfectly
4164380	4167540	cool and they're honest with their kids and they don't you know nobody's like
4167540	4172820	it's not like the you know that weird toxin that's like and it's not like it's
4172820	4176660	not like those spoiled la parents you see where it's like the parent is the
4176660	4179860	best friend of the kid and it's like it's not that either it's just you and
4179860	4183140	he's when he's when you witness like transparency in a family it's always
4183140	4186140	like kind of inspiring like I could do this I could try that's where the word
4186140	4197060	parent comes from parent prep from transparency that's Latin look it up so
4197060	4209020	all right so Spencer hey oh oh god speaking of horrible things hey I'll
4209020	4215660	take it from here I guess is there what's burning your croc come on give it
4215660	4220060	give it give us Spencer's up Spencer what's what's what's burning your boots
4220060	4223700	lately what's chapping your hide I can't what's it what's a bee in your bonnet
4223700	4231540	the pee in your blanket mattress add in my bill free thank you yeah do you have
4231540	4236980	a bugbear that's currently haunting you right no well okay yeah I listen so I
4237060	4241660	listen to NPR I think it's great I think everyone should listen to NPR but
4241660	4245940	sometimes you listen to these stories and they try and put too cute of a
4245940	4250780	button on the end of their stories like and it's I can't I can't think of any
4250780	4257100	good examples like I don't know like there'd be a story about like a goose
4257100	4261780	who lost his sight and then they'd end the story with like or no it's about a
4261780	4265020	goose and then they like restored its site because like chemicals got thrown
4265260	4270340	I don't know but then they'd be like but for one goose in Portland he will have
4270340	4277500	a gander I knew that's all I'm Nancy Klein NPR news and it's like so many
4277500	4281500	they're trying so hard yeah I can't think of any good that was that was
4281500	4285260	pretty hard to avoid if you're writing that story you don't do the goose
4285260	4290900	without the gander you have to listen to NPR and then they're like like okay
4290900	4295460	that's that's NPR thanks for all your thanks for your money and it's public
4295460	4303180	and and stuff we'll be right back after a word from these strangers the John Q
4303180	4308900	and James don't forget but sometimes it's just out and out like but they just
4308900	4312740	make it sound NPR ish but it's like getting really close to just like radio
4312740	4319140	lab was made possible by a sum of money by the Colgate toothpaste people
4319380	4324420	Colgate toothpaste is an interesting new way of brushing your teeth like this
4324420	4331060	is a commercial for a thing it's true it's you know the public radio have
4331060	4335540	failed in America they had to they had to you know cave to public or to
4335540	4340860	corporate interests they shouldn't even there should be a very small portion of
4340860	4346700	what we call a lot of collective revenue you could keep a lot of cool shit going
4346700	4351060	that's my feeling about that in Britain you know the government pays for like
4351060	4354980	all that shit they have crazy awesome radio stations out there yeah like
4354980	4358060	there were other show their TV shows are kind of like well not all their TV
4358060	4361780	shows we always we fetishize British TV because we see like the really really
4361780	4366300	interesting cool shit that breaks on our shores but but like we don't have I
4366300	4369900	mean they're talking to Brian Cox I only saw the shows that's the physicist
4369900	4373980	Brian we see wonders of the universe there's that but there's way better
4373980	4377020	shows that don't air out here we just don't get them and their TV sounds so
4377020	4380620	much more interesting if you're into science shows the flip side of it is
4380620	4384420	course it like America's everything it's done it's like it's it's like the the if
4384420	4387020	you're gonna admire anything about America you've got to admire our
4387020	4391940	commitment to capitalism because like our like the money drives so many
4391940	4394740	interesting things so like the everything everything that's heightened
4394740	4397980	is so heightened because of money the idea that you could have a show like
4397980	4401820	Cheers or the idea that television could be the cornerstone of all culture which
4401820	4405940	is neither good nor bad but is a is a thing like the idea of the television
4405940	4410620	show lasting 10 years and being a part of your life and your children's life it
4410620	4415980	that that that is the opposite side of the coin of like in in Europe they when
4415980	4421240	they started doing TV they looked at it like a kind of a civic thing like they
4421240	4424220	looked at it the way we look at cable access and they're like you should
4424220	4427540	everybody take turns making a TV show and make sure it has something to do
4427540	4431540	with keeping England better and there's there's still some kind of there's still
4431540	4435900	a little bit of that of that juice behind their TV industry whereas with
4435900	4439900	us it's just like fuck you man and they're like it's whatever what am I
4439900	4444500	talking about stick your head up your ass some more yeah I got invited to go
4444500	4449060	to to the LHC the Large Hadron Collider and go check it out I'm very excited
4449060	4452820	about yeah I'm not fucking right although they're turning it on soon so I
4452820	4458340	won't be able to see it while it's on cuz we're all gonna die that thing's
4458340	4463780	gonna make a dragon I sat there and said like I said explain to me I know I
4463780	4467660	know a little bit about the Higgs boson and whatnot like explain the Higgs thing
4467660	4471460	and he just he broke it down for me and started talking space-time and like
4471460	4474820	explaining space-time to me and I have no idea what he was talking about but
4474820	4477540	it was fascinating and I felt very cool and they went outside and there was
4477540	4481540	stars out and I go like what's that he goes I can't I wish I could do his
4481540	4485060	accent cuz he's very charming has a kind of a soft Manchester accent it's like
4485060	4490260	that's Jupiter I go why don't why don't stars why don't planets twinkle and he's
4490260	4493980	explained why like I was like I was gonna I'm gonna make out with this guy
4493980	4503820	right it's stargazing with professor very good you know I hit a guy in the
4503820	4507220	show one of the guests when I I played the theme song that Eric I'd let written
4507220	4512380	and I got to play music on the under live like the radio broadcast and they
4512380	4515900	had one of the guests was the cat that created teacher Rama his name I forget
4515900	4522140	and the keys into science and I won't remember if you say it so yeah you you
4522140	4529580	won't you won't remember Matt Cranig's name someone said David X Cohen I honestly
4529580	4532940	don't remember his name but he was very good and they were talking about science
4532940	4538420	stuff and like like they would make up science and change science to just you
4538420	4541300	know cuz it's a TV show it's a cartoon they're like we have to get to the
4541300	4544940	planet is 500 light years away well that you know you realize it's traveling
4544940	4547820	the speed of light it would still take 500 years to get to the guest but we
4547820	4551340	spent we sped up the speed of light and I couldn't the crowd kind of chuckled
4551340	4554780	and then Brian Cox like no no that's wrong you want to slow down the speed of
4554780	4557540	light the speed of light we're 30 miles an hour we could all get there and the
4557540	4564340	crowd cheered everybody yeah fucking science I was like I still doesn't make
4564340	4568540	any sense to me I love that you know if you want to if you want to see some
4568540	4571740	science fiction that really makes sense you should check out this movie I just
4571740	4581980	saw called the the astronaut in the bookcase colon interstellar it's based on
4581980	4587700	a novel of the astronaut in the bookcase by sapphire it's like whoo it's a goodie
4587700	4595980	not not sense nothing the sequel to 2001 have I have I sat through people in
4595980	4599100	space professor Cox said he liked it cuz the science was all right well I'm
4599100	4610620	sure it was it seemed pretty right to me Jesus Christ man not good you didn't
4610620	4615220	dig it yeah I was not into it I've not seen it so I can't you know we're have
4615220	4619620	you seen interest teller no is that that Christopher Nolan guy yeah Dan doesn't
4619620	4623940	seem to like his films no I do I do that's why I'm actually confident enough
4623940	4629620	to say okay come on I'm letting that one over the plate like if Tarantino or
4629620	4633220	the Coen brothers made a movie that was like you know I think Christopher Nolan's
4633220	4639140	talent and value to cinemas I was just the story I was like we're finding out
4639140	4642180	time and time again that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director who really
4642180	4645700	desperately needs a quality screenplay to be placed in his hands before he
4645700	4648700	before he starts shooting because otherwise it's gonna be like you're
4648700	4651940	gonna be watching like something that is like really beautiful and you're gonna
4651940	4665180	you know two hours through it be like why did you like her loved her yeah well
4665180	4668460	that's a great I mean if you read that script you'd be like riveted the entire
4668460	4671020	time you're reading the script that's a sci-fi movie if you read the script for
4671020	4674020	interstellar you would not be you would not it would not be a page-turner you
4674020	4679820	would be like 20 pages and he's still what do you mean it looks like a smeared
4679820	4695660	bookcase oh it's back to that no he's the reason why the watch I mean I yeah I
4695660	4699980	I imagine that would be astounding if when those things were happening in the
4699980	4705860	first two acts I wasn't constantly going what then it would be amazing that it
4705860	4711620	all came back to the thing that made you go what the fuck what I'll be
4711620	4716340	walking down the street go make sure is hard living on earth and the apocalypse
4716340	4726700	is all dry what what what the hell what was that some kind of silver entity just
4726700	4731380	said gooboo gooboo gooboo and then flew into the Sun this movie sounds three
4731380	4736560	hours later oh I'm changing I'm changing into something I can't goo boo
4736560	4739660	goo boo goo boo goo boo goo boo goo boo boo goo boo whoa

4744420	4761340	oh I get it oh wow that's why the movie was stupid cuz of me by credits it's the

4828020	4832580	quite well but I can't think of his name he's always standing over your
4832580	4839700	shoulder with a pair of scissors and a marathon number on a bloody tank top
4839700	4845500	and he's screaming something a warning about something but I can't and then I

4859100	4863780	shadow I don't want to say this so is there is there is there a new trend in
4863780	4868820	retail that people have to greet you when you're not if you're not looking at
4868820	4872540	them they have to say hi how are you sir welcome thank you for being I've heard
4872540	4877060	that complaint no no I'm not joking no no I've heard that complaint in with
4877060	4884220	increasing frequency I ignore people it's an alarming rate now it's like
4884220	4887700	three or four people okay just go shopping for something I know what I'm
4887700	4892460	looking for I know where it is I go in I go find it and I'll walk in door and
4892460	4894980	there'll be this voice behind me it's kind of like how are you doing sir yeah
4894980	4899420	and I would turn around and look but it's so faint that it's I'm hearing more
4899420	4903100	stories about confrontations with these people because they're hired to do a
4903100	4906180	certain thing and it's not just old people at a Walmart anymore it's now
4906180	4909740	it's like a 35 year old person who's been told that they have a certain
4909740	4915500	activity log and they get there they're starting to get aggressive Aaron told me
4915500	4920460	no I'm not joking I'm not I'm not joking either and when I leave why do you have
4920460	4926820	to say be well sir some weird shit but they're like they're they want to actually
4926820	4929980	Aaron was telling me a slightly different story because that pet pet pet
4929980	4936860	store there's people that they'll just what let
4936860	4940820	wander around the aisles that are like shilling they're a specific brand of cat
4940820	4945900	food or dog food and those people like like they're really aggressive and weird
4945900	4949780	and like if it's you can do but that that shit is for when there was a
4949780	4952820	container container store lady there Aaron had another story about this
4952820	4957860	obviously Aaron goes out into the world and she brings these stories back when
4957860	4960980	you're in like when I was in France or like you're in Italy people say bonjour
4960980	4964940	no everyone you pass says good day yeah and in France good day everyone says
4964940	4967980	bonjour wherever you go and it's just a thing you say bonjour and that's that
4967980	4970900	you walk into a store you say bonjour to the person that works there when you
4970900	4974620	leave you say merci and that's it but you it's kind of rude to not do that
4974620	4977700	which is fine because that's just kind of par for the chorus but I was in a
4977700	4981940	hotel in San Antonio Texas where I wanted to I would kill people out of
4981940	4985420	kindness because it was like every ten steps like good morning how you doing
4985420	4990100	hey howdy you couldn't go ten steps in that hotel with every fucking person
4990100	4994180	bidding you good day it's like that's too much and most people don't want to
4994180	4998540	talk to other people yeah like you say if I'm looking forward if I have if I'm
4998540	5003180	going places like if I know you if it's eye contact and I see you and we pass
5003180	5008220	each other you go hey howdy fine deal but it was you keep hearing it over
5008220	5010860	your shoulder and right
5010860	5015580	that's what I'm telling you but yeah keep playing the music well can I tell
5015580	5021660	you two sad things before we start Shadow Run that are that are like Aaron's
5021660	5030100	not here she's gonna take care of Nigel our grief dog and the and then Curtis
5030100	5034940	is not here which is tied to I don't even like and I haven't even checked up
5034940	5038460	on it since he told me about it I asked him if he was coming to the show last
5038460	5045780	week we were in Austin and he I almost I'm so conflicted because it's like well
5045780	5049060	why why create the awareness of something that you're blissfully unaware
5049060	5053260	of if you're unaware of it but at the same time it almost feels strange with
5053260	5057140	our new friend he's like going through this like dark dark thing like we were
5057140	5061300	talking to Curtis he hosts that show with Bobby Carradine and Bobby Carradine
5061300	5065900	was just in this terrible terrible car accident and he the last I looked he's
5065900	5071140	in critical condition which I assume is it I I googled I googled his name and
5071140	5075860	unfortunately and I never if I could have clicked an off button that would an
5075860	5084140	option I would not have seen the car you know I saw the car that that that he
5084140	5092180	crashed in and it can't possibly be good with the you might call it critical I
5092180	5097460	think someone already took care of that job the so so Curtis is like you know
5097460	5101300	like that that's a good friend of his and he was like he wanted to come and
5101300	5105420	hang out with us but his life is like topsy-turvy like he's he's got he's
5105420	5108260	going through a little we just met him and just made good friends with him
5108260	5112340	really fast but he it's just as he's going through this like intensely dark
5112340	5117300	tunnel so I hope he comes back and on the off chance he's listening our
5117300	5122900	thoughts and prayers are with with you and your folks and that's that's it I
5122900	5128700	don't know I just wanted to say Bobby right yeah is he ever his father ever
5128700	5133220	Carradine I don't know I think so yeah she's a she's a friend she's great too
5133220	5142340	very talented family an awesome family yeah so random it's like whatever good
5142340	5147220	job Dan you did it you did it whatever you're setting out to do let's let's
5147220	5150140	reach out to Curtis because we've we've all I don't know about you guys I've
5150140	5158980	fallen in love with that guy I think maybe that's why it was enough for me to
5158980	5164140	have worked with him on on acceptable TV yeah that one morning yeah enough yeah
5164140	5166940	yeah yeah I was really taken with him at that point because he was so
5166940	5171620	professional he came in and yeah he was like but maybe that's why I brought it
5171620	5175100	up is cuz I think I feel like I feel so much affection for the guy and I felt
5175100	5180420	like the audience did too and I wanted them to know that like he actually felt
5180420	5185140	the exact same way it wasn't like a it wasn't like a bit like it was with
5185140	5193300	LeVar Burton who just just shot through our world like a meteor and charmed us
5193300	5199820	and and is apparently on to bigger and better things but Curtis Curtis really
5199820	5203300	really enjoys his time here and wants to it wants to come back and stuff and
5203300	5206260	was just going through yeah he hugged me one time or a couple times actually and
5206260	5210140	it made me feel it made me feel quite special like that all right it's a rare

5589940	5594180	then I continue my sentence by going like I just I don't know something just
5594180	5603820	doesn't add up I always wanted to be that guy the billiard guy every time

5640060	5643940	telling you I have a kind of a mild like recreational addiction to this drug
5643940	5647580	called psyche which kind of makes my intuition and logic go up and I kind of
5647580	5652540	like it's like mushrooms but like it's good for shamans and stuff well you know
5652540	5658620	you're a young kid I don't think you should do that shit I could stop

5709900	5714940	shouldn't be playing that role I don't care okay I don't care
5714940	5719420	nightblade how drunk are you right I never mind I forgot I shouldn't care I
5719540	5724340	don't care look look we yeah we broke a lot of eggs back there we killed a few
5724340	5728860	people we certainly stunned a lot of people with electricity but you know I
5728860	5732700	mean I guess that's the life we've chosen I never feel good about it leave
5732700	5737420	me going forward I'm gonna start taking strides to be non-lethal any way that I
5737420	5741340	can just wonder on these streets they're always looking to medicate themselves
5741340	5748500	the idea of a be better than better than life chip is a not gonna be a Pandora's
5748500	5757500	box I mean if it was just a short mission I'm fine I don't need to make a
5757500	5760620	bigger deal out of it are you saying that that this might come back to bite
5760620	5768020	us in the ass I'm just picking at it like a kitten picks it a knot I'm never
5768020	5773740	gonna untie it I just just a thicker piece of thread than usual you know I'm
5773740	5778460	sorry I forget I said too much I'm alone I would say that it's in my
5778460	5784460	estimation that this is the way that we work that it is all life is a mission
5784460	5788820	now we're on the dark side you don't know so there is nothing but short
5788820	5791900	missions and long missions and the longer mission is to stay alive you guys
5791900	5798540	when I was I would say let him play with his balls in any time I perhaps will
5798540	5810420	take some of this and I will purchase indulge my own active soft addiction
5810420	5817580	and learn some new accents other ways to be other things to do we've kind of
5817580	5822500	grown to love your your kind of Norwegian accent I think you but you did
5822500	5827740	not even notice that I changed and became more precise with my accent over
5827740	5833140	time what is it now well now it is a skill soft announce inactive soft because
5833140	5837900	there was some problem before people saying it was Germanic and hurts August
5837900	5846140	so what I've done is I have suspended over a bulb and over a pool of water
5846140	5850900	listening to evangelists again but this time listening to soil festivities which
5850900	5859940	I think this is one of his best albums and learned a more academic by according
5859940	5866180	to oil Norwegian accent one from Oslo the Oslo accent it's like this it sounds
5866180	5869060	fantastic I love it well I gotta say I really love hanging out with you guys
5869060	5872900	when we're not kicking ass it's just it's just fun to shoot pool get high
5872900	5882620	and talk shit yeah I mean I a point taken though before that you know they
5882620	5886980	don't call them they don't call them picnic runs you guys can I connect can
5886980	5891180	I tell you a little story I had that stored up for a while can I tell you
5891180	5894500	that when I was when I was a little girl and I was living out in the woods with
5894500	5898260	the with the Salish Indians because I had to flee my family and live out there
5898260	5902500	and like learn the shamanistic ways it was a there's a story that means a lot
5902500	5906180	to me that I think would probably help maybe maybe mean something to you guys
5906180	5911180	too it's a young young Indian scout and he's walking around by a riverbed and
5911180	5918820	he sees a bear and and the bear is looking for salmon and he salmon keep
5918820	5923180	jumping by him and the bear is like I can't catch any salmon and the salmon
5923180	5926140	keeps jumping by and he's I can't catch any salmon the young India's cat walks
5926140	5937260	up and says oh my god a talking bear it's a little little Salish comedy for
5937260	5945780	you let's probably get a new mission what's your name yeah what's your name
5945780	5950260	yeah hey Mercy why don't you go talk to Teddy and see if we got anything new on
5950260	5953540	the burner Teddy we just got a lot of we just got a lot of money from you we'd
5953540	5958940	like some more do you have any do you have any hookups yeah maybe I mean I
5958940	5964420	gotta tell you guys I've been I've been watching your progress you uh you got on
5964420	5969820	you got on security films you know there's footage of you the people know
5969820	5973700	you're out there it's it's no good I tried I tried to do what I can to kind of
5973700	5977460	clear your traces you know no don't worry about it no need to pay me or
5977460	5981700	anything but you got to watch out man you had police on your tail this is how
5981700	5986580	people dies how shatter runners get a get killed what would it cost for you to
5986580	5992060	perhaps say stumble across some sort of mission for us oh you know I don't know
5992060	5998820	it's it's all whatever I'll find I'll see what I can do and uh you know as soon
5998820	6003460	as as soon as he finishes speaking as if on cue you see an older elvish man
6003460	6010140	scramble into the bar the bar you're all in in fact not just any bar he's he's
6010140	6014100	wearing a fine Italian suit although it's wrinkled and must as is the man's
6014100	6018620	hair and he's clutching a pistol he looks like he hasn't slept in days I
6018620	6025580	would like to perhaps activate both at the same time my ability to with combat
6025580	6033820	sense and also to detect enemies to see if this one is perhaps a problem you use
6033820	6038580	your skill to detect enemies and I say the heart of God but and also to induce
6038580	6043460	laughter I said a heart again that you sounded really Norwegian right now it's
6043460	6047940	really good I thought at that point he sounded more like Anatolian than he's
6047940	6056580	ever sounded I'm also the same person I was when I started he said he's insecure
6056740	6062060	I've never had a home oh so what's up with this up what's what's up with this
6062060	6065780	all this guy's got a pistol in his hand he's waving a pistol around yeah he
6065780	6077660	doesn't appear to be an enemy though perhaps the two of you will begin to
6077660	6089820	continue to talk and I will keep one eye on this this intruder okay what do you
6089820	6096060	do what do you say hey buddy you know I hold out my my hands in that way that
6096060	6101860	will allow my Aries predator to come out of my robot arm shoot him but in the
6101860	6109380	meantime I'm just like just sexy and cool and friendly and I'm like hey man I

6393180	6399980	around huh yeah you can't tell that's timeless I don't know who took him but
6399980	6403940	my best guess is that Arturo knows a thing or two and look if you end up
6403940	6407860	putting some bodies in the ground make it look like someone else did the job I
6407860	6412300	pay some extra to keep those shitheads off my back for a while and to leave my
6412300	6417420	name out of this which is Ryan Dervish
6418180	6423340	find Arturo find what he knows I feel like it's gonna be easy to keep his name
6423340	6429460	out of this mr. Dervish as a fellow elf and a fellow
6429460	6433100	medicine woman you got my word we're gonna get we're gonna get your son back

6438460	6443220	describes it I'm feeling like my mind's being probed right now what's what's it
6443220	6448020	going on well it's just a sort of it's what we call the normal vetting process
6448020	6452940	before we start he starts screaming and you can read into his thoughts it's very
6452940	6457020	uncomfortable for him but you see great shame and his his business you see his
6457020	6461580	business has not been doing so well he can't pay the mob so much it's really a
6461580	6465380	tough time for this guy's life and he's at his wits end he's just carrying a
6465380	6471980	pistol around public so let him off the hook and then I say look I apologize but
