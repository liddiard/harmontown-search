0	19280	Hello, Houston!
19280	26600	Harman Town is now in session, please welcome to the stage, your mayor of Houston and of
26600	29600	Harman Town, Dan Harman!
29600	45600	Thank you, Houston, maybe I should use this one.
45600	46600	Should I use this one?
46600	47600	Yeah.
47600	48600	The wireless one.
48600	49600	Thank you.
49600	50600	Thank you.
50600	51600	Oh boy.
51600	55160	Do I have to tap it or swipe it?
55160	57440	Is it like a Google, Google microphone?
58440	61440	Boy, what a fuck up of a start of a show.
61440	63440	The auxiliary cable wasn't in.
63440	71440	Thank you, Houston, Texas!
71440	77440	Dan, guess what the first word said on the moon was?
77440	78440	Probably Houston, right?
78440	79440	It was Houston.
79440	85440	It was Houston.
85440	92440	Yeah, even the people on the moon got the city right, yeah.
92440	97440	That guy shouting out from the audience is referring to a fact that could have otherwise
97440	100440	been lost to the ages.
100440	106440	If it weren't for your diligence, sir, the Woodward and Bernstein of the fucking Houston
106440	115440	show, that during the Q&A that preceded the show, I, having driven three hours from Austin
115440	123440	to Houston, thoroughly enamored with every city in Texas, as I always am, particularly
123440	130440	ones with Alamo draft houses, I referred to Houston as Austin in the equivalent of an
130440	132440	80s sex comedy.
132440	136440	I just called out a different lover's name.
136440	139440	I love you both.
139440	142440	I love Houston even more.
142440	151440	And then there's a lady in the front that cannot, she is compelled to remind us that we are in Katy.
151440	153440	We are technically in Katy.
153440	156440	I imagine it's like, you know, I'm from Brown Deer, Wisconsin.
156440	162440	It's Milwaukee, but it's like, I'm sure Katy is like, it's a suburb of Houston, right?
162440	165440	But no one wants to feel like they're in Katy.
165440	172440	Everyone was like, clearly, like Katy was, whoever came up with the idea of calling this area something
172440	181440	other than Houston was a giant asshole that was either dodging taxes or exploiting workers.
181440	186440	I don't know what the history is, but no one's going to call this place Katy.
186440	187440	I swear to God.
187440	193440	I promise we're in Houston and sometimes Austin, if you get me drunk enough.
193440	194440	All right.
194440	195440	Houston, Texas.
195440	197440	Some trivia about Houston, Texas.
197440	198440	Erin.
198440	199440	Yes.
199440	202440	The typewriter was invented here.
202440	205440	Did you know that?
205440	209440	By Neil Armstrong.
209440	219440	He got off of the rocket ship and he was like, Houston, we need a device that I can use to write a letter
219440	221440	to tell you we don't have a problem.
221440	222440	The moon looks great.
222440	226440	I can't wait to get back to Houston.
226440	234440	Guest comptroller Erin McGathey, everybody.
234440	238440	Wes Anderson is from Houston, which I found very surprising.
238440	240440	Lance Hendrickson?
240440	241440	Wes Anderson.
241440	242440	Oh, Wes Anderson.
242440	244440	Fuck that.
244440	246440	I was all excited.
246440	247440	Lance Hendrickson.
247440	248440	Holy shit.
248440	249440	That's awesome.
249440	250440	Wes Anderson.
250440	252440	I mean, all right.
252440	254440	Fine.
254440	256440	He's not here, is he?
256440	257440	Yeah.
257440	259440	He's in this podium.
259440	267440	He's in an adorable pink hand-drawn diorama.
267440	269440	Is it twee?
269440	270440	It's very twee.
270440	271440	All right.
271440	272440	You cool?
272440	273440	Yeah.
273440	274440	You look very nice tonight.
274440	275440	Thank you.
275440	276440	All right.
276440	277440	Thanks, guys.
277440	279440	We'll edit all this out.
279440	280440	What do we refer to?
280440	281440	People are listening.
281440	283440	They're like, I just started cutting the carrots for my salad.
283440	284440	Hurry up.
284440	285440	Do your show.
285440	288440	Now it's a segment called Shadow Puppet Theater.
288440	289440	Whoa, look at that.
289440	290440	Whoa.
290440	295440	For those of you listening, there's an amazing shadow puppet.
295440	297440	Facts about Houston, okay?
297440	298440	Yeah.
298440	306440	It's on the Houston River, which runs from Dallas to the Gulf of Mexico.
306440	315440	Houston was a port city founded by travelers who were selling pelts and spices to the Houstonina
315440	319440	Indians of Texas.
319440	323440	This is reading like the shittiest fifth grade book report right now.
323440	324440	All right, Dan.
324440	328440	I know that you prepared this right before class, but go ahead.
328440	337440	What would become Houston, Texas began as a cowboy hat store next to a cattle trough
337440	342440	where you could slake your livestock's thirst or fit it with a custom hat.
342440	343440	Yeah.
344440	347440	Soon after that, the local barber moved in.
347440	349440	Back then, a lot of people don't know this.
349440	354440	Barbers were also the police and dentists.
354440	363440	There was a famous shootout here at the Houston Corral between a cow that didn't get his hat fitted properly
363440	369440	and a dentist that thought he was in charge of the law.
369440	370440	I'm sorry.
370440	372440	Do you have something to say, Erin?
372440	379440	I was just curious with the barbers and the dentists, were they carrying instruments true to their profession
379440	383440	or did they have guns like cops and then also barbers?
383440	387440	A typical Houston dentist in 1900, which is when the city was founded,
387440	394440	would have as a deputy or sheriff, they would have a gun,
394440	398440	a six gun on their hip and a big hat made next door.
399440	402440	But as a dentist, they would have the dental tools as well.
402440	404440	There's a lot of famous stories.
404440	410440	Billy the Kid, he's famous for shooting 59 people.
410440	414440	47 of those are Houston dentists.
414440	416440	It's not because he was quicker on the draw.
416440	422440	It's because they forgot they were on the clock and they drew a pick instead of a gun.
422440	424440	It's a simple mistake.
424440	426440	They were actually better cowboys than Billy the Kid.
426440	427440	He wasn't that big a deal.
427440	432440	He just spent a lot of time in Houston shooting innocent dentists.
432440	438440	Innocent, talented, wonderful, law abiding, quicker on the draw dentists who made a simple fuck up
438440	445440	and paid for it with their lives and were reduced to footnotes in the history of some asshole who prayed on dentists.
445440	454440	Houston exists in the shadows of egomaniacs, tyrants, liars, politicians, vampires.
454440	457440	They sit here, they weather the storm.
457440	469440	Houston, that's why the first mayor of Houston, Richard Dawson, called Houston the city on the verge.
469440	470440	That's what it's called.
470440	472440	You can see it on its license plates.
472440	475440	Houston has its own license plates.
475440	482440	It's the only city in Texas to have its own license plates as of 1983.
482440	490440	I heard that you know about the infamous Houston underground, the society under the city.
490440	491440	Yeah.
491440	492440	Can you tell us about that?
492440	502440	Houston is famous for having a city underneath itself called Houston because it gets really hot hair in the summer.
502440	508440	And if you need to get your hair cut, you could die just walking from your house to get your hair cut.
508440	515440	So they have adopted the practice that moles and ants before them have adopted of staying underground to stay cool.
515440	516440	It's no big deal.
516440	517440	Yeah.
517440	519440	Don't shame them for it.
519440	521440	They're an underground people.
521440	527440	It's controversial because they're taking up a lot of the city's resources.
527440	530440	Well, the controversy is actually that they cheat.
530440	535440	A lot of Houston is actually in Arizona.
535440	537440	Yeah, I've heard that.
538440	546440	Because they do this weird measuring thing where you can only technically, if you're measuring property, you have to do it above ground.
546440	547440	And so they cheat.
547440	552440	And actually, Houston is 750,000 miles in diameter.
552440	557440	And a lot of it exists under Las Vegas and Phoenix.
557440	561440	And they use it as a tax dodge.
561440	563440	Yeah, it's a big problem.
563440	564440	But it's sensitive.
564440	566440	And you can hear these people.
566440	570440	I think you can hear their silence and their murmuring.
570440	572440	It's because they're sensitive about it.
572440	577440	They know that Houston is guilty of this.
577440	579440	But at the same time, they profit from it.
579440	580440	Totally.
580440	584440	I heard that all the highways in Houston were built by Beyonce's dad.
584440	587440	That's correct.
587440	589440	Heinrich Knowles.
590440	601440	The third, he was a former Nazi sympathizer turned 1940s Houston engineer.
601440	604440	He was at the forefront of the automotive revolution.
604440	607440	He designed a lot of what we call today's highway system.
607440	608440	He started in Houston.
608440	610440	It was sort of a guinea pig city.
610440	611440	Yes, yes, yes.
611440	613440	Again, you're shaming them.
613440	614440	And they don't deserve it.
614440	615440	They're a good city.
615440	616440	They've done a lot of good for a lot of people.
616440	618440	And you're bringing up the terrible things.
618440	622440	That they're mole people who were founded by a Nazi.
622440	629440	Obviously, Houston is infamous for danger and mystery and intrigue.
629440	630440	I have so many questions.
630440	634440	And because I know that you know so much about it, I just keep asking.
634440	636440	Just the typewriter was invented here.
636440	638440	It's like, focus on the positive.
638440	644440	This is the first city to ever elect a three-legged governor.
644440	647440	It was the first city to elect a governor.
647440	651440	They rose above the tyranny.
651440	655440	There used to be a rule that if you were a city, you couldn't elect a governor.
655440	658440	They used to tell you you have to elect a mayor.
658440	660440	It's fucking horseshit.
660440	662440	Houston broke that wall down.
662440	665440	Houston said, no, we want a governor.
665440	666440	And he's going to have three legs.
666440	667440	It's all lost.
667440	668440	It's all lost to history.
668440	673440	Now you look it up and it just says some crap about mission control.
673440	674440	It's just garbage.
674440	677440	It's a bunch of big NASA politics.
677440	678440	Yeah.
678440	683440	As somebody who's planning on going to the moon, I mean, you're kind of, this is a really
683440	684440	important city.
684440	689440	This is the United States elevator to the moon.
689440	690440	I'm not using it.
690440	693440	But we're not going to start.
693440	696440	I mean, it's too, you know, yeah.
696440	699440	Have you heard about the, you said moon elevator.
699440	700440	Uh-huh.
700440	704440	You know about the, you guys know about the elevator, uh, principle?
704440	706440	Like, like, like somebody was telling me.
706440	710440	Oh, this sounds, this sounds like, uh, uh, breaking news.
710440	712440	Are you, do you have a sound cue?
719440	721440	This sounds like breaking news.
731440	732440	All right.
732440	733440	Yeah.
733440	741440	Uh, yeah, there's, they, uh, I'm going to get this very wrong, but they, uh, there's
741440	748440	a, there's this principle that, uh, rocketeers, I think they're called in space engineers are,
748440	754920	are like talking about where it's like, it's actually might be actually practical scientifically
754920	760480	rather than launching things to and from the moon, uh, to the, that we should build
760480	766080	a space elevator because the physics work out that once the, that gravity is a problem
766080	770880	when you're building like towers and shit, but if you commit and actually build a tower
770880	773720	tall enough, it gets out into space.
773720	778200	And then of course the opposite effect is happening out in space and it's like, you
778200	782960	can actually just make this like metal noodle connecting the earth to the moon or maybe just
782960	786160	the earth, maybe not to the moon because I think that would bend and break it.
786160	789600	I don't think you should connect anything between the earth and the moon.
789600	794880	Um, but like to, to build like a space elevator that takes you out into space rather than
794880	800640	a rocket that you would just, I mean, you know, and hey, let me tell you, I hope nobody
800640	805560	farts in that thing because that's a, uh, that's all, that's all, that's a 27 minute
805560	806560	ride minimum.
807560	809560	This has been moon news.
809560	810560	Yeah.
812560	816560	Dustin, could I have it so I can just play the cue whenever I need to play?
816560	820560	I have several cues and I'm very proud of and.
820560	825560	Can you tell me, can you hint to me the kinds of things that you have music for so I can
825560	826560	bend the show?
826560	828560	I can't because I think you'll tell me not to do it.
828560	829560	No.
829560	830560	No, I can't.
830560	831560	I can't.
831560	832560	Can I, can I get a, can I get a drink?
832560	834560	Can I get a tequila?
834560	835560	Jesus.
835560	836560	Oh boy.
836560	837560	Here we go.
837560	840560	This is how it starts, movie of the week.
840560	842560	This has been moon news.
842560	843560	What do you want, Scoops?
843560	844560	You want a vodka?
844560	848560	Okay, I just want to add that.
848560	852560	Uh, no, I want tequila because I quit vodka.
852560	854560	Oh, your health kick.
854560	855560	Okay.
855560	856560	Give her tequila.
856560	863560	Um, the, uh, I want, I want to, uh, I want to, I want to meet one friend from Houston.
864560	868560	Just a, just a, just a random person.
868560	871560	There's people who are calling.
871560	873560	Is random Randy here?
873560	875560	Is that, well, I can't know.
875560	877560	I mean, I see Minecraft disqualifies you immediately.
877560	881560	People would kill themselves if I started talking about Minecraft.
881560	886560	Um, we got, there's, there's, uh, there's a teacher.
886560	887560	What's that?
887560	888560	Asian guy.
888560	890560	That's, that goes a long way.
890560	897560	Physicist, I heard community college.
897560	900560	Does anyone have a full glass of tequila?
900560	902560	Someone's working on that for you.
902560	903560	Don't worry about that.
903560	905560	Just got married.
905560	907560	Let's get the guy who just got married.
907560	908560	Uh, okay.
908560	910560	Who's the guy that just got married?
910560	913560	Is that, is that Tom Gray?
913560	917560	Tom Gray, come on down.
917560	920560	All right.
920560	924560	Tom Gray is wearing a tasteful Heather sweater.
924560	929560	He is walking with confidence, but not with arrogance.
929560	931560	Someone called out that's not random.
931560	932560	Good point.
932560	935560	I know his name for some reason.
935560	936560	Tom, here's the thing.
936560	938560	Your wife is the best wife of the world.
938560	941560	She wants, she tried to put the fix in here.
941560	943560	Grab any mic that you want.
943560	946560	Uh, she talked to me while you were taking a shit.
946560	947560	Oh.
947560	949560	And said, make me the best wife in the world.
949560	953560	Bring my loving husband that I'm married to for a week up on stage somehow.
953560	955560	I was prepared to do that.
955560	958560	What she didn't know is that you would be like, bring me up.
958560	960560	She probably knew that.
960560	961560	Yeah.
961560	963560	Well, she's a good wife.
963560	966560	Give her those points in spite of your zeal.
966560	968560	It's been seven days.
968560	971560	So when you're, when you're married for a week, what's it like?
971560	973560	Um, it's been good.
973560	976560	It's, um, yeah, I mean, we, we've been together a very long time.
976560	982560	So I was very curious to see if anything would change and nothing seems to have changed.
982560	983560	Okay, good.
983560	984560	How long have you been together?
984560	988560	Um, we have known each, how long?
988560	989560	I don't want to get it wrong.
989560	991560	Eight years, she says.
991560	992560	She's got this.
992560	993560	She's wrong, actually.
993560	994560	It's longer.
994560	998560	So we've known each other since middle school, dated in high school.
998560	999560	Wow.
999560	1000560	Yeah.
1001560	1004560	Someone in the audience was horrified.
1004560	1006560	Did you guys go to prom together?
1006560	1010560	And so somebody reacted to you saying you met your wife in middle school as if you said
1010560	1015560	you got bit by a brown recluse and lost your leg.
1015560	1016560	Yeah.
1016560	1017560	Yeah.
1017560	1018560	That wasn't good.
1019560	1020560	No, she wouldn't go to prom with me.
1020560	1021560	Actually.
1021560	1023560	She didn't want to go to prom.
1023560	1024560	Oh, I see.
1024560	1026560	One of those couples that said we're not going to go to prom.
1026560	1029560	Do you still feel, feel good about that decision?
1029560	1032560	Uh, I've gone back and forth.
1032560	1034560	That's a weird question for me to ask.
1034560	1035560	Yeah.
1035560	1037560	Am I allowed to pry, Tom, since we have you up here?
1037560	1038560	It's a personal show.
1038560	1039560	We will try.
1039560	1040560	Tell me if you...
1040560	1041560	You don't bully her, right?
1041560	1045060	You don't have to answer anything you don't want to answer, but I'm going to ask whatever
1045060	1046060	I want to ask.
1046060	1051560	So, so you, if you met your wife, I think the reason that guy said Jesus Christ is because
1051560	1056360	when you, you, you met the woman that you ended up marrying, you were so young that she might
1056360	1058560	have been the eighth woman you met.
1058560	1059560	Yeah, probably.
1059560	1068720	And so the question is, like, how much field playing did you do before you committed to
1068720	1072360	your fantasy football?
1072360	1074240	I know less about football than you do.
1074240	1075240	Yeah.
1075240	1077360	Well, you couldn't tell from my metaphor.
1077360	1079000	Trust me, that metaphor sucked.
1079000	1084900	Uh, no, but, but I, you know, I, I, I think that's, I, I have, I'm from a very small town
1084900	1090860	in Wisconsin and there is a, there's at least two couples I could name that were couples
1090860	1095740	when we were in high school and at my 20 year reunion, we're all 40, whatever we are.
1095740	1100760	And uh, and, and two of them are still, you know, they're married couples and they have
1100760	1103860	kids, uh, that are old enough to be here at the show.
1103860	1107380	The, the, the, my, and I think the question on everyone's mind is like, all right, then
1107380	1108380	what are we doing?
1108380	1109420	What are any of us doing?
1109420	1114600	If it's possible for you to meet the love of your life when you're a child, does that
1114600	1117960	mean that everyone's full of shit?
1117960	1121200	Or does that mean that the people in question are really lucky?
1121200	1122200	What is the truth?
1122200	1124360	There's seven billion of us on this earth.
1124360	1129200	Are we, are we really keys and tumblers?
1129200	1135560	Why is the divorce rate now like a million percent, uh, whereas in caveman times it was
1135560	1137100	0%.
1137100	1141400	Is it just because we were brutal people and try and made mari- I'm laying a lot of shit
1141400	1142400	on you.
1143400	1146320	Let, let, let me bring it back to your area.
1146320	1151000	My, my, my, if I was Howard Stern, the way I would pose my question is how many people
1151000	1152800	have you had sex with?
1152800	1159080	Uh, and, and I actually preferred your first question, Howard Stern question, but the answer
1159080	1164280	to that question would be one, so your, your wife, you lost your virginity to her and you
1164280	1166560	guys like, I mean, that's a beautiful thing.
1166560	1168920	I think that's a system that works.
1169560	1170560	Let's see.
1177040	1181480	There's a group of children outside that, that agree, we're happy about it.
1181480	1185560	They're playing hopscotch and they're, they're high fiving you on your almost Mormon like
1185560	1186560	life.
1186560	1194300	Um, what, so, so you got, you guys met in junior high, you met as like, you met when
1194300	1200540	it was, uh, actually illegal for either of you to, uh, uh, do anything sexually.
1200540	1207260	You grew into sexual adults, you did it with each other, you took a vow to only do it with
1207260	1208260	each other forever.
1208260	1216780	Now you are one week into that and you're saying nothing's changed and, uh, so, uh,
1216780	1217780	what do you think?
1217780	1218780	What do you think the odds are?
1219660	1222500	Society says 70% chance of divorce.
1225260	1226740	Another Howard Stern question.
1228500	1229300	I mean, I don't know.
1229300	1230580	I actually don't know a question.
1230580	1233740	I think it's just people are fascinated with this stuff because we want to know like, are
1233740	1236340	we allowed to be romantic?
1236340	1238180	Are we allowed to be pie eyed?
1238420	1240980	Are we, are we allowed to not be cynical?
1240980	1243940	You know, it's like, cause sometimes that could be the biggest mistake you ever make.
1243940	1249500	I think sometimes like I, cause I always think like when we watch romantic comedies,
1249500	1253380	we actually poison ourselves because then we take that into our relationships and relationships
1253380	1257100	can actually be so much more romantic if we actually allow ourselves to be human and not
1257100	1261740	like these characters that are played by Matthew McConaughey and Meg Ryan and, and whatnot.
1261740	1266220	Like, like we're watching 90 minute little stories about how the, you know, romance is
1266220	1268500	this romance is that when marriage is a completely different thing.
1268500	1272700	So, so, so on one hand, naivete is like, can, can be one of the worst things in the world.
1272700	1276700	On the other hand, it's like truly a resource that we've squandered in this country.
1276700	1278020	We don't have it anymore.
1278020	1279700	Like the idea that, oh, I just love you.
1279700	1280700	Fuck it.
1280700	1281700	Let's just be together forever.
1281700	1282700	And you know what?
1282700	1283700	I don't have a question for you.
1283700	1286940	I just try to, I think that, I think that people in the audience want to know as they
1286940	1290900	would, they want to know from Neil Armstrong, what's it like to land on the moon?
1290900	1294500	They want to know from somebody who hasn't fucked anybody other than their wife.
1294500	1297820	Uh, uh, what, what are the, how, how are you going to do that?
1297820	1298820	How are you going to pull this off?
1298820	1299820	It really sounds like Dan's panicking.
1299820	1300820	Yeah.
1301420	1303420	Is, is he getting married in a few weeks?
1303420	1304420	We get married in three weeks.
1304420	1305420	He's like, Hey, I mean, what do you do?
1305420	1308420	And then what if it's, what if the keys to the wrong tumbler?
1308420	1310420	And then you're like, Oh God, I killed myself.
1310420	1311420	And then you're doing all these shows.
1311420	1312420	You have a documentary about you.
1312420	1315420	And I was like, what do you, how do you tell your parents?
1315420	1317420	I mean, I don't even wear, I'm 41.
1317420	1328020	I don't, Aaron, we don't have the, I, I am, I am, I am, I am settling down with Aaron at
1328020	1329020	the perfect time.
1329020	1335220	Like I, I have met the love of my life and I, I also coincidentally, I don't, uh, I'm
1335220	1340820	not, I suffer no illusion that I would ever even be thinking about like, what would life
1340820	1347220	rot, uh, bring me if I, if I didn't do this, but you seem like a young strapping man here,
1347220	1348820	the prime of your life.
1348820	1351820	My God, I bet your dick could cut glass.
1351820	1358820	I just always felt like I would be a really bad single person.
1359020	1360020	Oh God.
1360020	1361020	Yeah.
1361020	1362020	I am.
1362020	1363020	Can you, can you relate to that?
1363020	1364020	Of course.
1364020	1365020	Yeah.
1365020	1367020	I, I, I, I, yeah, I, I, I can't, I, I'm not a good single person.
1367020	1369620	It just seems like the alternative is always worse.
1369620	1370620	Yeah.
1370620	1371620	Yeah.
1371620	1372620	Ah, romance.
1372620	1373620	Uh, boy.
1373620	1374620	But okay.
1374620	1383420	It's, I, I mean, the, you're so right about romantic comedies and we've talked about this
1383420	1388700	before, but I mean, romantic comedies peddle this idea that's not real, that partners are
1388700	1393540	like looking for apartments, but those apartments are already furnished.
1393540	1396900	So you go into an apartment and you're like, ah, oh, I could live here.
1396900	1397900	And then you're like, ah, I don't know.
1397900	1400380	I don't like these, these mirrors on the wall.
1400380	1404540	I'm not into this, but I think the way that relationships really work is that you go into
1404540	1410660	a space that's unfurnished and the furnishing is the relationship that you build together.
1410660	1414140	So you walk into a space and you're not like, ah, I don't like it, but it's, it has to be
1414140	1419020	like a space, like in the part of town that you like, in the city that you like, I'm going
1419020	1420820	to keep on going with this metaphor.
1420820	1425740	Um, so you're like, I, yes, this apartment I could build, I could live here.
1425740	1431180	And then together you, you furnish it, but romantic comedies, there's this, there's this
1431180	1435220	idea that you're living in the apartment and then you look across the way into another
1435220	1439180	apartment and you're like, oh my God, no, that's where I'm supposed to live.
1439180	1443340	But no, you don't, you don't just get all that for, that's not what a relationship is.
1443340	1444340	Mass is always greener.
1444340	1445340	Is that what you're saying?
1445340	1446340	Uh, not necessarily.
1446340	1447340	Yeah.
1447340	1453220	So romantic comedies, that's a, that's certainly an idea in romantic comedies, but it's just
1453220	1458780	like any valuable relationship, the important stuff I think is stuff that you build together
1458780	1465580	and the stuff that's the most romantic for me with me and Dan is when we have like, when
1465580	1469860	we have like a breakthrough together as a couple, when we, the most romantic thing is
1469860	1472980	when we work through something like that really means something.
1472980	1478300	And so rom coms, rom coms, like any other movie treat romantic relationships like any
1478300	1482700	relationship they do, but we don't notice as much between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker
1482700	1489140	as we do between, um, you know, the, the couple in sleepless in Seattle, the, the, the characters
1489140	1491820	in movies have to be dimensionalized.
1491820	1496980	They have to be complete as individuals and then they have to kind of match up perfectly
1496980	1501260	and then they have to walk away like at the, at the end of Casablanca saying, I think this
1501260	1505580	is the start of a beautiful friendship and you have to go, oh my God, I love that guy.
1505580	1506820	I also love that guy.
1506820	1507820	They're going to make a perfect cut.
1507820	1509220	This is going to be great.
1509220	1514340	That's how we approach romance and rom coms when the truth is a relationship is actually
1514340	1519900	a very codependent thing where you're like, you have a, you, the, if your relationship
1519900	1523700	is going to have life, like it's good, you're going to be creating a new thing.
1523700	1525580	Um, who cares?
1525580	1526580	That's right.
1526580	1531980	Danny Hall is so genius because it captures like this romance and there's this great romance,
1531980	1532980	but it ends.
1532980	1537500	I'm like, that's, there's romance and then there, there are relationships and both should
1537500	1538500	intertwine.
1538500	1543380	But like, you know, not every romance should be a relationship.
1543380	1551940	You can stay in an apartment for a night like an Airbnb, but you don't rent it.
1551940	1555180	You know, do you, do you, do you fight with your wife, Tom?
1555180	1556180	You've been married.
1556180	1557180	Yes.
1557180	1558180	Yes.
1558180	1559180	Correct.
1559180	1560180	So do you, do you, do you, do you yell?
1560180	1562500	Do you go like, shut the fuck up.
1562500	1563500	Yeah.
1563500	1565180	You're a terrible person.
1565180	1567820	Are you explaining what yelling is?
1567820	1571260	I want to, well, I want to know what the definition of yelling is because I'm always curious about
1571260	1572260	that too.
1572260	1573260	Like how ugly does it get?
1573260	1575260	Like, is there a cap that other couples have?
1575260	1578300	It's probably about the same as any average couple.
1578300	1579300	Yeah.
1579300	1580300	I mean, what is it?
1580300	1581900	I mean, it's like the, it's like the Kinsey thing.
1581900	1587300	Like we don't, we, we, we don't know what average couples do.
1587300	1592420	We don't, we don't, there's no, like, we don't, people say like, oh yeah, I had a fight with
1592420	1593500	my girlfriend last night.
1593500	1595180	We don't really know what that means.
1595180	1597780	Like, like we have, we have lines that we draw.
1597780	1600100	It's like, did you, did you touch her?
1600100	1601100	No.
1601100	1602100	Okay.
1602100	1603100	No, no, I don't do that.
1603100	1606140	But it's like, how mean do you get when you fight with your lover?
1606140	1609060	Like I say terrible things.
1609060	1613580	I get so mad and I, and I like say awful things.
1613580	1618380	And then we, like, like, and, and then we're going to couples therapy now and I'm finding
1618380	1620340	out like, I don't have to say those things.
1620340	1623100	That's like, that's like not standing between me and happiness.
1623100	1629140	Like I, I'm, I'm just being, and I apologize to my dad if he's still listening, but I am
1629140	1630780	just being my dad on those moments.
1630780	1633660	Like I'm like, like, like possessed by some ghost.
1633660	1637540	Like I'm, I, what you didn't buy toothpaste.
1637540	1639100	Why am I having a reaction to that?
1639100	1640860	It's an actual fight.
1640860	1646700	Like I don't, I don't know how you would answer this question honestly, but I'm just really
1646700	1656100	curious how a nice fellow like you, your shirt looks like a nicely pressed picnic blanket.
1656100	1657980	Your pants are, are, are clean.
1657980	1660780	I bet if I sniffed you, I wouldn't vomit.
1660780	1663380	Like your shoes look nice.
1663380	1665540	Your wife came up to me.
1665540	1666900	Your hair is cut.
1667140	1669060	Your, your, your, your face is smooth.
1669060	1670940	You're, you're a nice young man.
1671300	1673620	You're, you're, you're very nice looking.
1673780	1675620	Your wife is very nice.
1675660	1677820	She, she, you guys look nice together.
1677820	1678740	You've been married a week.
1678740	1680420	She came up, you were in the bathroom.
1680420	1682740	She's like, I want to be a good wife to my husband.
1682740	1683900	I want you to make them happy.
1684100	1685260	You guys are adorable.
1685380	1687500	It's like parks and rec obnoxious.
1689180	1694820	Well, and I want to know, I want to know what the fight says parks and rec at night.
1694820	1696020	Does it get community?
1696020	1702100	Does it go like, fuck you, fuck, fuck, and I don't know how you can answer that
1702100	1703380	because you're such a nice guy.
1703420	1706860	Well, well, first of all, let me work on that.
1707100	1710180	Well, first of all, on the clothing and the way she looks and everything, we're,
1710180	1711020	we're 25.
1711020	1713620	So we've had like 15 weddings to go to this year.
1713620	1715940	We literally came from a wedding to come here.
1715940	1717220	That's why I'm dressed like this.
1717220	1719060	We drove from a wedding to this.
1719060	1720940	I'm hoping it's our last wedding of this year.
1721100	1725140	No, you're, if you're 25, well, maybe it's different in Texas, but like,
1725860	1731140	if you're 25, your, your wedding attendance just started.
1731180	1734460	Like it's going to double every year for the next 10 years.
1734580	1735060	I'm done.
1735100	1735100	
1735100	1737420	By the time you're 35, you're going to have a wedding.
1737460	1741660	That means by my calculations, you're going to be at a three weddings a day.
1742740	1747020	Cause it doesn't even really kick in until your friends are 30.
1747340	1747700	Yeah.
1748180	1753140	Um, as for the fighting, I guess we, we actually went to different colleges and
1753140	1754900	did long distance for four years.
1754900	1760540	So a lot of my fighting memories, I guess would be over the phone.
1760860	1765180	And I feel like that was where our, uh, our fighting got the ugliest one.
1765180	1766100	We don't fight a lot.
1766100	1769460	We really don't, but I always feel like I hated arguing on the phone.
1769460	1772020	I really don't even like talking on the phone, which is not good for a long
1772020	1775860	distance relationship because you know, that's the only way you can really
1775860	1778420	communicate or Skype and things like that.
1778420	1782380	So I hated because she, she's the type that when we argue on the phone, she'll
1782380	1785900	hang up and then I call her back and she won't pick up and then I'll call
1785900	1787060	her back and she won't pick up.
1787060	1788820	And that, that was always messy.
1788820	1791020	So that when you first brought that up, that's the first thing I think
1791020	1794580	about is I hate any kind of argument over the phone.
1795860	1799820	But you, so is she hanging up because you're getting overheated or is
1799820	1802780	she hanging up cause she's like, yeah, usually I'm being an asshole or
1802780	1803540	something like that.
1803540	1806380	And she'll just get, get the little dee dee dee from the iPhone.
1807660	1808660	Oh, there she goes.
1810580	1811740	You guys sound tame.
1813220	1817020	That's yeah, I just feel like I don't throw the phone at her or anything like
1817020	1817220	that.
1817220	1820380	And that's why I wouldn't, yeah, I don't throw anything in air and I just feel
1820380	1822780	like, I just, I feel like a Marvel character.
1822780	1825340	Like I, this is the way I talk to her sometimes.
1836980	1840620	Have you guys found that the, uh, any kind of arguing or anything since you've
1840620	1844500	gotten engaged and sort of wedding planning, I noticed that we tended as the
1844500	1845780	closer we got to the wedding.
1845780	1849140	I expected it to get more, I expected it.
1849140	1849900	It's actually different.
1849900	1853820	I expected it to get more stressful, but we actually got more and more like kind
1853820	1854700	of excited about it.
1854700	1855380	You're a mutant.
1855420	1855620	Yeah.
1855620	1856340	Okay, sorry.
1856580	1861980	I know we both self destructed and I, I air it every, everything about Aaron
1862020	1864940	that drives me nuts and everything about me that drives her nuts.
1864980	1869700	We doubled down because we're coming up with a wedding.
1869700	1873940	We're both unconsciously going like, we're going to marry each other, better get
1873940	1875060	used to this.
1880180	1887300	Just continue to continue your, uh, don't, don't, don't act like it's my fault.
1887300	1888820	That music doesn't match what's going on.
1890660	1893060	She placed random Turkey in the straw.
1893060	1893620	Turkey in the hay.
1894700	1896100	You were, you were, you were being Southern.
1896460	1897660	No, I was not being Southern.
1898260	1904420	Uh, the, uh, yeah, no, I feel, I mean, but, but we also like, I don't know, I guess
1904420	1905620	we're just all little people.
1905620	1911700	So we're, I feel like when you get married to somebody, all of their faults become
1911700	1919020	magnified in a way because you're like, Oh, I, I'm, I also feel like this sounds
1919020	1926740	like somebody who's justifying craziness, but I do feel like it's because I take
1926740	1928700	marriage incredibly seriously.
1928780	1933940	I have absolutely no intention of ever getting divorced if I get married, because
1933940	1939820	I feel like my parents' generation was kind of a little fast and loose with the
1939820	1940500	vows.
1940540	1944780	Otherwise we wouldn't be in the situation we're in where everyone you know is
1944820	1946180	raised by single parent families.
1946460	1950660	I don't, I also think it's a bad thing to stay in a marriage for your kids.
1950660	1954660	If that's literally the only reason you're doing it, then fucking divorce, uh, each
1954660	1956300	other, your kids will thank you later.
1956620	1968860	Um, but I don't want to half ass this thing, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't
1968860	1970020	like doing things twice.
1970020	1970900	I'm very lazy.
1970900	1975340	So when I get married, I want to, I want to stay married for a really long time.
1975340	1978580	And so, and for that reason, I think it's like, I don't know.
1978580	1982460	It's like all of a sudden you're coming home and like every, every little
1982460	1985980	conversation is like, has this like giant weight behind it.
1986780	1992620	And, and wouldn't, you know, it planning a wedding, as you may know, like seems to
1992620	1996660	involve a couple of activities and things that do decisions.
1996660	1997820	Yeah, a little bit of money.
1997860	1998260	Yeah.
1998460	2001940	If there's anything wrong with the relationship, the weight will find it.
2002140	2006220	I, I, I found an out where we're going to couples therapy and I'm like, like, like
2006260	2008180	Aaron is just doing everything with the wedding.
2008300	2010140	Uh, I, I, I'm cheating.
2010380	2011540	I just feel like I'm cheating.
2012100	2013460	Aaron's doing everything with the wedding.
2014060	2018700	I, I tell her that, uh, I'm the first groom that's ever, uh, planned 50% of the
2018700	2022620	wedding, but I'm lying to maybe 15%.
2022820	2024420	I, yeah, I, yeah, I don't know.
2024660	2026820	I don't care about weddings.
2026860	2027620	I think they're dumb.
2028820	2030580	I think ours will be good then.
2031500	2031780	All right.
2031780	2038500	Well, let's thank Tom Gray for coming up and talking to us about, I hope that you
2038500	2045700	guys, uh, I hope the next time we talk to you, the, maybe we'll talk to the next
2045700	2047700	time we talk to them, they'll have a little gray baby.
2048460	2049620	Oh no, you're shaking your head.
2051460	2053140	He's too, they're too, they're too good.
2053140	2054900	They're not going to bring a child into this world.
2055940	2061700	I, I'm just fixated on the, the, the, the words, uh, gray baby together.
2062860	2067740	Um, he shook his head in a way that meant to me that either like, what's that five
2067740	2068220	years?
2068340	2069860	Oh, you're just going to wait five years.
2070300	2070860	Oh, okay.
2071660	2077340	The way he shook his, and then he said seven, the way he shook his head made me think you
2077340	2080020	guys were about to have your first biggest fight tonight.
2081180	2081500	Good.
2081500	2083460	That, that I would be like, we'll see you have a baby anyway.
2083500	2083860	Nope.
2083860	2084500	And then he sat down.
2084500	2087500	I was like, oh man, we finally found a way to make them like us.
2087580	2090020	They're going to, they're going to fight hard tonight.
2090020	2092460	This is like, why did you shake your head so hard?
2093260	2094700	Are you excited about the wedding?
2095180	2096540	I'm very excited about the wedding.
2096660	2097460	All right, cool.
2098060	2108020	Uh, uh, that, uh, it's a good, a good segue, um, to, uh, McGathey game corner.
2112220	2117500	I, uh, I put together, I put together a theme song for game corner on the, on the
2117500	2120340	drive from Austin to, uh, to Houston.
2120500	2121940	So here goes.
2128740	2130500	Let me feel this way.
2131340	2133740	What are we giving to you?
2134740	2137500	Let me dream of you.
2147700	2149220	They got the game corner.
2150220	2158300	Was that, was that, was that a lot of that in the song was that were those farts.
2159300	2160700	Those, those were farts.
2160700	2164700	Those were farts by our very own Dustin Marshall, everybody.
2169220	2172580	Those were the, those were the farts that I, that I was trying to do in the car.
2172980	2176780	I was trying to record farts into the laptop and Dan was like, Oh, come on,
2176780	2178460	let me, let me, and took the laptop.
2178460	2180060	And his farts were so gross.
2180060	2181780	I feel like your feelings were a little hurt.
2181780	2183740	Cause I was like, your farts are so disgusting.
2184140	2184300	Yeah.
2184300	2186020	Well, why, what are they supposed to be?
2186780	2188220	And what were those by the way?
2188220	2189500	It was like wicked game.
2191980	2193140	Didn't sound like farts.
2194420	2199300	So we're going to play a game called who are you marrying?
2199300	2207300	And, uh, and for this game, I, I did, I did a little work before the show.
2207300	2208860	I reached out on Twitter.
2209220	2213180	I, uh, I wanted to find a fellow redhead female.
2214260	2215940	Uh, so can I please bring to the stage?
2215940	2221460	Caroline, Caroline, come on down.
2221740	2225860	You want to see if I can literally tell the difference between you and
2226500	2231860	you just want to test my face blindness.
2232500	2234260	I know she's the one sitting in the chair.
2234300	2234980	Thank you, Caroline.
2235140	2237460	If you, if you wouldn't mind sitting in the chair.
2238900	2239620	Thank you so much.
2239620	2240860	Who the fuck is who?
2240860	2241300	I don't know.
2242300	2248060	So, uh, Caroline and I, uh, answered the same set of questions and what I'm going
2248060	2251820	to do is I'm going to present the question and I'll give two answers and
2251820	2255460	you'll have to choose which one is my answer.
2255820	2260780	But we need someone to play against you and for funsies, is there any man out
2260780	2264900	here, um, and this is an embarrassing question to ask, but is there any man
2264900	2268220	out here who thinks that they know me pretty well, who could like compete
2268220	2269780	with Dan at knowing questions?
2271780	2272140	Yeah.
2272140	2272380	Okay.
2272380	2274180	There's, there's, I saw your hand first.
2274180	2275220	Come on down there.
2275460	2278340	You just maximize the chance that this podcast recording will be
2278340	2280100	used in a future criminal trial.
2282580	2283860	Andrew, everybody.
2284860	2289260	Is there any, is there any man in the audience who thinks they know more
2289260	2291060	about me than my fiance?
2292300	2292820	All right.
2293860	2294900	All right.
2296780	2297300	Okay.
2297300	2301020	So this is going to be, I didn't, I didn't catch your name.
2301020	2301460	What was it?
2301500	2301860	Andrew.
2301940	2302900	This is Andrew.
2303300	2303980	I'm the teacher.
2304300	2308740	Now, no matter what happens, you're not calling off the wedding at this point.
2308780	2312980	Like you're, I say, let's, let's, let's be organic about this and just see.
2314300	2317140	And I'm divorced, so I'm, I'm not, I'm, I'm good with marriage.
2317140	2318220	I don't, I don't want that anymore.
2318220	2319620	So you're safe, Dan.
2320260	2321100	Just in case I know more.
2321420	2321860	Okay.
2322940	2324220	Um, and I'm so sorry.
2324220	2324860	Oh, here we go.
2325420	2325980	Got a pen.
2326060	2326540	All right.
2326660	2331860	So Caroline, if you could position yourself like kind of in a, in a way where Dan can
2331860	2335580	kind of look at both of us a little bit, that was a weird way to phrase that.
2335620	2335900	All right.
2337220	2337620	Great.
2337620	2340140	So, uh, this is the way we're going to play.
2340140	2344340	We're going to, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna play it.
2345020	2350820	And if you, if you answer correctly, uh, you'll hear this and if you answer
2350820	2354420	incorrectly, you'll hear this heard these noises already.
2354420	2355180	We're familiar with them.
2355180	2356620	We like them like they're family.
2358260	2359500	All right, here we go.
2359980	2363900	Uh, here's the first question.
2364900	2365420	All right.
2365860	2372860	My favorite meal of all time is a sun-dried tomato bagel with veggie
2372860	2378660	cream cheese topped with tomatoes, or B Buffalo Mac and cheese with a crisp
2378700	2382020	beer and a side of spicy pickles or bourbon.
2384420	2388300	Uh, I will go with the sun-dried bagel affair.
2389500	2390020	Andrew.
2390220	2391180	I'm going to go with B.
2392180	2395500	It's, uh, mine was sun-dried, uh, sun-dried bagel.
2395540	2396340	Good job, Dan.
2400300	2402580	Here, Caroline, can you grab that, uh, microphone?
2403540	2405020	Carolina, how are you doing?
2405060	2405820	I am excellent.
2405820	2406500	How are you doing?
2406540	2407820	I'm doing, I'm doing great.
2407820	2408980	What do you, what do you do, Caroline?
2409260	2412820	Oh, uh, I am a leasing consultant in property management.
2412820	2416020	So I do an apartment complex, basically.
2416820	2417340	All right.
2417340	2418540	It's as interesting as it sounds.
2419780	2420300	Awesome.
2420420	2420900	Okay.
2421540	2422260	Here we go.
2422340	2425060	Carolina and her husband were the first in line for the
2425060	2425900	Harbontown screening.
2425940	2430220	They came from Baton Rouge, which I always thought was a fictional place.
2430980	2431420	Really?
2431620	2432660	I thought that C.S.
2432660	2434460	Lewis, uh, made up Baton Rouge.
2434820	2436340	Well, it's funny you did actually.
2436340	2437940	It was named after the fact.
2438020	2438380	Oh yeah.
2438420	2438620	Yeah.
2438620	2441740	It's sort of like, um, Hobbit town or whatever over in New Zealand.
2441860	2442260	Oh, okay.
2443580	2445820	Baton Rouge, I guarantee.
2448300	2448740	All right.
2448780	2449620	The Big Easy.
2449940	2450860	No, that's New Orleans.
2450860	2453340	I know, but Baton Rouge is sometimes referred to as the
2453340	2454900	slightly smaller easy, right?
2467140	2467420	Okay.
2467420	2467900	Here we go.
2467900	2468580	Question number two.
2468580	2470900	And Andrew, you get to answer this question first.
2472500	2478860	My childhood best friend and I used to play a game called a the Dolly Pardon game.
2478900	2481620	We would wear our mother's sweaters, stuff them with water balloons to make
2481620	2488060	boobs, and then we would take turns motorboating each other or be, we would
2488060	2492140	basically make up ongoing soap opera like stories and a lot of those stories
2492140	2496060	focused on relationships and romantic entanglement entanglements and sassy
2496060	2498420	kids sidekicks were, who were basically us.
2499060	2503340	I think it has to be B cause I know a was mine and probably Dan's as well.
2505660	2507220	Dan, Dan, which one is me?
2507620	2509380	I think you're the Dolly Parton.
2509500	2511140	Uh, that is correct.
2512180	2513660	Andrew, it's not looking good for me.
2518660	2520540	You have to understand that I'm playing a different game.
2520660	2525220	If I get one of these wrong, it's two years of suffering.
2526340	2528500	Can I get another little bit of tequila?
2529220	2529900	Thank you.
2530860	2531820	All right.
2532420	2536700	I don't know if you guys feel this way on the stage and this, this is a not, not cool
2536740	2539180	of me to really talk about the lighting, but the way the lighting is, I feel like
2539180	2542420	I'm hiding in a closet with one bulb swinging back and forth.
2543580	2545060	Um, all right.
2545100	2546780	It's mildly terrifying up here.
2546780	2548300	Like, I don't, I don't know how you guys,
2549300	2550900	the nature of being on stage.
2550900	2552700	I think it's our job to suck it up.
2554940	2556860	You're totally right for them.
2557580	2560740	The lights being here to illuminate us for so that they can see us.
2560980	2561500	No, I know.
2561700	2562980	I'm less complaining about the light.
2562980	2566460	I feel, I feel self-conscious cause I feel kind of like, like weird.
2566700	2571740	You're doing a great job, Aaron.
2572180	2572940	Thank you, Andrew.
2573580	2574300	Jeff who?
2574860	2575260	Sorry.
2575660	2576340	Jeff who?
2577100	2578340	All right.
2578820	2581820	Uh, next question.
2581860	2584020	Uh, Dan, you get to answer this first.
2584060	2588860	My mother's maiden name is A Hartley B.
2589180	2589820	Dunkle.
2593900	2596380	A Hartley B.
2596620	2597300	Dunkle.
2599020	2599500	Fuck.
2601780	2605740	Uh, my mother is dead.
2610300	2614900	I get, I mean, it, it doesn't even matter at this point if I get it right,
2614900	2616860	because I already revealed that I.
2618940	2620100	Don't know.
2620180	2623540	Um, so it's a matter of whether I guess right.
2623540	2624060	And I don't know.
2624060	2627620	That would be kind of an empty victory, um, because I could flip a coin.
2628060	2629260	I think it's Dunkle.
2630180	2630580	All right.
2630580	2631100	Andrew.
2631220	2632820	Yeah, I'm going to agree with Dan.
2633060	2634540	It is Dunkle.
2635060	2636100	It is Dunkle.
2638020	2638340	All right.
2638340	2639340	Dan has three points.
2639340	2640900	Andrew has one point.
2640900	2643620	Andrew, you get to go first in this round.
2643900	2644580	Next question.
2644700	2646780	When I was a kid, I was afraid that.
2647260	2650660	A, my dead grandfather could see everything I could see.
2650660	2652740	So I closed my eyes when I got out of the bathtub.
2652740	2653940	So he couldn't see me naked.
2656340	2660500	Or B, I was afraid that I would be separated from my family and would
2660500	2663700	wonder the streets forever, or that members of my family would be lost forever.
2663700	2665260	Sometimes amnesia was involved.
2668660	2670940	Um, I'm going to guess B.
2672180	2673060	All right, Dan.
2673340	2675580	Uh, I think, shit.
2675660	2680220	I think that, so I don't remember you ever talking about either of these things.
2680860	2683540	So I'm trying to figure out which one sounds more like you.
2684620	2690380	Um, I think that because you're inherently narcissistic, the answer
2690380	2692860	is the non-empathy related one.
2693420	2698420	Uh, and the grandfather one involves thinking about other people.
2698420	2700620	So I think that it's B.
2701060	2706620	No, I was afraid that Pinkney McGathey could see through my eyes.
2708140	2711380	And so I would close my eyes when I was using the bathroom or getting
2711380	2713820	out of the bathtub or changing my clothes.
2715260	2715620	All right.
2715620	2717860	Well, maybe you became narcissistic later in life.
2717900	2720860	Pinkney McGathey from Houston and worked for NASA.
2721380	2721940	Fun fact.
2723660	2727220	And who developed a little known technology for NASA in which you could
2727220	2729860	see through your living grandchild's eyes.
2730340	2732940	It was actually a legitimate fear.
2734700	2735140	All right.
2735180	2736780	Next question.
2737020	2747060	My first CD was a, they might be giants flood or be Glenn Miller orchestra in the mood.
2750260	2754100	A, they might be giants B Glenn Miller orchestra.
2754100	2755700	I believe Dan is going first.
2755940	2763140	Uh, I think your, your first CD was your, your first CD that you bought with your money.
2763700	2766180	Uh, no, just the first CD in your possession.
2766980	2769060	So Glenn Miller.
2769900	2770460	Andrew.
2770620	2771020	Yeah.
2771020	2771420	Yeah.
2771460	2772020	Glenn Miller.
2772020	2772460	Definitely.
2773020	2773940	That is correct.
2775580	2777820	Caroline is much cooler than me.
2779780	2780860	Oh, that was your second CD.
2782780	2783260	Oh, really?
2783500	2784580	You're talking to the microphone.
2784700	2785300	Sorry.
2785860	2788820	No, that was her second CD.
2788820	2789700	That's interesting.
2790060	2793900	Uh, me and the same girl that used to play the Dolly Parton game would play this game
2793900	2797780	called M and M where we would like listen to the dances and pretend we got married.
2797780	2801580	And then we'd take our hands and put them over our mouths and pretend to make out.
2801580	2802700	And then we would have a baby.
2805420	2812500	Why don't more, are there any gay men in the audience that are, no, that's, that's a
2812500	2813340	little remarkable.
2813660	2818100	I, I, I, cause I'm wondering if like, like, well, it's like girl, every girl I've ever
2818100	2821660	talked to, they always, like their developmental years, they, it's like this.
2821780	2823380	Did you not do anything like that?
2823380	2828060	I've always assumed that men, boys kind of did similar things.
2828100	2830740	Oh, I had a lot of, I, I, no, I don't know.
2830740	2834340	Guys, we don't do that, but it's like pee together and stuff.
2834340	2838060	I mean, like we pee together and we show, we show each other our wieners.
2838060	2841660	And yeah, you like that trough in elementary school and one guy stands on the
2841660	2846260	end and you try to shoot it across and hit the guy standing over there with your pee
2846260	2849100	or with your dick.
2849100	2852700	If you're blessed, I mean, you'll hear, you'll hear the craziest shit.
2852700	2855700	If you got like, like people go, oh, summer camp, we would do this.
2855700	2856980	We would all jerk off in a bucket.
2856980	2862900	And like, it gets a little weird, but it's all kind of penis based and like the
2862900	2868220	penis is a lightsaber and we would, you know, it's, it's not, but, but girls, like,
2868220	2874020	they just like, oh, every, almost everyone I've ever talked to in their early years,
2874020	2876980	there's these stories where they just like, Oh, this is how you socialize.
2876980	2883700	You go through this stage where with another girl, you, you practice being boys and girls
2883700	2884180	together.
2884180	2888820	Like why I was Fonzie and I don't, I don't think it's every girl.
2888820	2891500	I know for me, it felt like, I don't want anyone listening to feel weird.
2891500	2896900	If it didn't happen, I just mean, for me and my friend, it really felt like an extension
2896900	2901620	of playing house, which girls do like to play.
2901620	2905260	We like to play, we like to play a lot of house and we like to.
2905260	2913540	But with each other, I do, when I was a kid, when I was like nine or 10, I think me and
2913540	2923980	my best friend, we started, we went, we started playing pizza, pizza boy, which should, which
2923980	2932420	if it had an accurate title would have been called pillow humping because the game was
2932420	2935620	he and I would pretend to be pizza delivery guys.
2935620	2944340	We would ring the doorbell of my home and pretend that girls answered walk into a living
2944340	2949900	room, which we would pretend had two invisible girls in it with, and we were delivering pizza
2949900	2956420	and then we would make small talk and we would sit down each with one of these large
2956420	2958100	couch pillows.
2958100	2964100	So we're 10 years old, so there's like these 70s sofa pillows that are like as big as us.
2964100	2968500	And we would put our arms around him and practice talking to them and be like, yeah, so what's
2968500	2969500	your name?
2969500	2970740	Oh, Stacy.
2970740	2974540	And he's doing the same thing in the same room.
2974540	2979740	We're talking to pillows and then we would start making out with the pillows and then
2979740	2985140	me and my friend, I know it's the same thing, except the only thing different is that men
2985140	2989500	have this kind of inherent homophobia where like we don't practice on each other.
2989500	2994180	I think there's like a really specific line there and I don't know if it's nature or nurture
2994180	2995500	that draws that line.
2995500	3000460	I'm sure it's nurture because we're all human, but it's just so funny that like when I really
3000460	3004380	think about it, because when I hear that from girls, I'm like, oh, we would come over and
3004380	3007860	she'd be pinky Tuscadero and I'd be Fonzie and then we'd go, oh, so you guys were just,
3007860	3011740	you were just making out, but it was like a game, but now I'm really thinking about
3011740	3012740	it.
3012740	3013740	Oh yeah.
3013740	3019820	No, me and my 10 year old friend humping pillows next to each other, high fiving, like celebrating
3019820	3024460	how straight and awesome we are, humping pillows.
3024460	3029740	And then like we would go climb a tree and talk about, I actually remember.
3029740	3031500	Did your pillow have a name?
3031500	3033460	You did definitely, definitely.
3033460	3036980	Like that was part of the whole thing was like they had names like, oh, mine's Stacy
3037100	3038100	and mine's Ashley.
3038100	3044420	And then I remember going and climbing a tree with my best friend and like remember, I have
3044420	3051780	an emotional memory, a deeply, a deep emotional bookmark of climbing a tree with my friend
3051780	3060420	after doing one of these sessions and, and sitting in the bow of a willow tree in Milwaukee
3060420	3070820	and the summer breeze and, and, and, and that's not, that's not commentary.
3070820	3078980	Well, it's not anything it's, it's a, it's a random sound, the, the, and me going like,
3078980	3085940	uh, like just, this is a lull in the conversation and I go, yeah, I'm thinking about, uh, thinking
3085940	3096180	about proposing to Stacy and, and just silence from my, and I remember just like, we, I don't
3096180	3100260	think we ever did it again after that because I think, I think that's the line that got
3100260	3104940	drawn between the, the, the people that end up at Ren fairs and the people that end up,
3104940	3107900	you know, at Verizon.
3107900	3113820	I think that I, I was like, yeah, I, I will, yes, what is the difference between any of
3113820	3114820	this?
3114900	3115900	Real person.
3115900	3120060	I think it's, it's the same as the little girls aren't socialized to like not touch
3120060	3121060	each other.
3121060	3122060	Right.
3122060	3123060	I know it doesn't make you gay, bro.
3123060	3124060	Right.
3124060	3127300	When we, when me and Megan were doing it, it wasn't, it wasn't like romance when we were
3127300	3133620	doing it, uh, when, when we were play acting in these things, it wasn't ever romantic.
3133620	3139540	There was never a moment where it even occurred to us, Oh girls do, do this to get, this could
3139540	3140740	be a sexual thing.
3140740	3147060	Like if someone was to walk in, it would obvious it would look like it would, you know,
3147060	3148060	we also took turns.
3148060	3149220	Like we played, we did that.
3149220	3154540	We played out this long story about these two young women because we always talked about
3154540	3158500	how we wanted to go to college together and then we would have an apartment.
3158500	3162860	And so we play acted this like episodic thing where we were two young, cool women in the
3162860	3167700	city and we both had boyfriends, but we had to pretend to be each other's boyfriends.
3167700	3171460	And so whenever I would be like, I want to go to, we got to name our boyfriends.
3171460	3172460	My boyfriend's name was David.
3172460	3175460	I think I was like, wait, Oh, Oh no, your name's Dan.
3175460	3176460	Sorry.
3176460	3177460	Sorry.
3177460	3186500	I had a moment where I was like, Oh, um, I wish I could just play frogs croaking or something
3186500	3187500	like right.
3187500	3188500	Random.
3188500	3192340	I played the banjo because it felt like an outside thing.
3192340	3194860	Like you're in the, you're in the tree.
3194860	3196180	It's a random sound.
3196180	3197180	It's banjos.
3197660	3200180	Will you forgive me for playing the banjo?
3200180	3203780	I'll forgive you, but I won't stop shaming you.
3203780	3206220	I condition people.
3206220	3207220	That's what I do.
3207220	3211540	I punish them when they do things wrong and then they stop.
3211540	3212540	I'm a behaviorist.
3212540	3213540	I have a question.
3213540	3215340	How old was the pillow humping thing?
3215340	3216980	Like just that because I'm a guy.
3216980	3219220	So I had something like that and I'm just wait, what do you mean?
3219220	3220220	How old was it?
3220220	3221620	I was like, I was like 10 or 11.
3221620	3222620	Yeah.
3222620	3223620	Okay.
3223620	3224620	Yeah.
3224620	3225620	Same thing.
3225620	3226620	Like 10.
3227060	3229900	I just, I just realized I'm a little bit more normal hopefully.
3229900	3234140	But, but, but, but here's the weird thing about the pillow humping that, that memory
3234140	3238940	with me and my friend, like both humping pillows next to each other, looking at each other
3238940	3243140	humping pillows and being like, yeah, it feels good, right, bro?
3243140	3247500	As part of some kind of play acting thing like playing house and playing the role of
3247500	3254260	men who are like doing it to women as pizza delivery guys that I also don't, I don't think
3254260	3256860	it was as sex, I don't think it was sexual.
3256860	3262060	I think we were pre puberty and we were doing this thing that there was enjoyment.
3262060	3268780	There was social like endorphins or dopamine spiking, but there was no arousal because
3268780	3274820	I, and the reason I know that is because a couple of years later, something incredible
3274820	3280420	happened and it was very private and fair and I wouldn't have shared it with anybody.
3280420	3285380	And I also wonder if that's nature versus nurture when you, when a little boy discovers
3285380	3294660	physical, coin area pleasure, like if it's, if it's nurture or nature that the little
3294660	3298460	boy immediately goes, this is a secret.
3298460	3303540	I am Howard Hughes, I have invented something that no one else can know about.
3303540	3308540	I am dedicating the next 16 hours a day for the next 35 years to this because I was like
3308540	3313220	watching Mark and Mindy and hopefully just Mindy.
3313220	3316420	I was just a latch key, hopefully because otherwise gay bro.
3316420	3317420	Right.
3317420	3318420	Right.
3318420	3319420	Who wants to fuck more?
3319420	3320420	Oh my God.
3320420	3321420	Fucking man.
3321420	3322420	No man.
3322420	3327700	Um, I was like, I was like laying on my stomach watching Mark and Mindy looking at Pam Dauber,
3327700	3334340	high five and, and, and, and, and, and was like moving my pelvis, slowly my pelvis is
3334340	3344220	moving.
3344220	3348180	But if you were looking at Mark, it would have been okay.
3348180	3353100	The, uh, that's a, that's an amazing meta moment.
3353100	3356620	The guy saying too soon said it too soon.
3356620	3362900	Um, the, uh, I, I, I, I just remember like, like moving and moving.
3362980	3367940	Pam Dauber and like, and then, and then, uh, and then the movement lives like a chain
3367940	3370300	reaction moving, moving, moving.
3370300	3371300	I'm going to keep moving.
3371300	3375420	I'm going to keep moving Pam Dauber, keep moving, keep moving.
3375420	3382300	And then the unthinkable, the unexperienced, the most incredible thing that had ever happened
3382300	3386700	to me in my life happening, which didn't involve at the time, not to get too clinical, did
3386700	3391900	not involve any liquid because my body was just getting to that.
3391900	3397500	It was like at that point as I, so it was all it was, was just this shutter and like,
3397500	3402460	Oh, and I, the last thing on my mind was my friends.
3402460	3405660	I wanted to like a sick cat.
3405660	3412620	I wanted to go into a cave and, uh, I just do this by myself forever, six times a day.
3412620	3418460	And uh, so, so I, my point being that that's when the real shit started.
3418460	3420020	That's basically who I am now.
3420020	3427900	Is that kid, the kid who was playing pizza guy and just miming coitus next to his best
3427900	3429340	friend in the living room.
3429340	3430340	It's weird.
3430340	3435420	It's like, it wasn't, it was sexual pantomime, but it wasn't, it wasn't sexual.
3435420	3438080	So I guess guys and girls, not that different.
3438080	3441820	It's just that, but there is that weird, I think there's a socialism.
3441820	3447980	Is it socialization though, that makes two boys not in those moments reach out and or
3447980	3448980	use each other?
3448980	3456220	Like, why wouldn't we, and do some boys do that and yeah, all kinds of questions.
3456220	3460220	I guess you guys aren't the ones to ask.
3460220	3463660	We should have a child psychologist come up here maybe.
3463660	3468500	Maybe it's sort of like, okay, so, um, there's this whole theory, like, if you give kids
3468500	3471980	less toys, they're more imaginative and creative, right?
3471980	3474900	And they've like make their own toys and do their own crap, right?
3474900	3479460	And guys kind of have a prop, if you will, like from early on.
3479460	3480460	We don't.
3480460	3483580	So we've got to come up with more shit, right?
3483580	3484900	That's an amazing theory.
3484900	3489900	I don't, but, but I don't think, I also think that all of us are wearing, it's like, like
3489900	3492780	you guys aren't these girls stories.
3492780	3494460	You're not taking off your pants.
3494460	3500340	I mean, I've also, I've been a nanny and I've worked with many, many boys who do do the same
3500340	3504900	thing and act out the same stuff and are physical with each other.
3504900	3505900	With each other?
3505900	3506900	With other boys?
3506900	3507900	Yeah, yeah.
3507900	3508900	Kissing each other?
3508900	3509900	Well, I mean, my friend never kissed.
3509900	3512940	We put our hands over our mouths and like pretended to kiss, but I've walked in on little
3512940	3519140	boys like acting out like prepubescent boys, just like acting out these scenarios in the
3519140	3521060	same way that girls are acting them out.
3521060	3524660	It's like a three-year-old little girl carrying around a baby doll.
3524660	3527820	She's not actually wanting to have a baby at three years old.
3527820	3533740	Both walked in on little boys, get specific so that this pad cast can really switch into
3533740	3537140	high gear, but also, because it's, I mean, it's an important distinction.
3537140	3538140	What do you mean?
3538140	3539140	You've walked into them doing what?
3539140	3540660	Because we're drawing a very fine line here.
3540660	3548860	I, I, I humped a pillow next to my friend, but girls, I'm saying like it's a fine distinction,
3548860	3549860	but the girls.
3549860	3557780	I, when I, when I was a nanny, there was a time when I walked in on a two, two, two friends,
3557780	3565300	who would be nine years old, acting out a doctor, nurse scenario, which on paper would
3565300	3567940	be a very sexy thing.
3567940	3571460	Like walked in on a like, is this your butt?
3571460	3573220	Oh, look at that.
3573220	3581540	And what, what probably had happened, what was the answer?
3581540	3583540	Is this your butt?
3584540	3585540	Yes.
3585540	3586540	Yes.
3586540	3591740	That's my butt.
3591740	3597300	We tend to ask that question later in life too, if a doctor asked me is this your butt,
3597300	3602220	I would definitely walk out and ask for a refund.
3602220	3604220	You should stop going to a nine year old doctor.
3604220	3611540	If, if, if you can't tell me, I know it's not your specialization, but in the same way that
3611540	3616980	me and my friend acted out this like apartment scenario, I think they had seen like a movie
3616980	3621820	where there was like a sexy nurse doctor situation or something where they were acting it out
3621820	3624700	and trying to figure it out.
3624700	3630660	But it was like, it would, it could have been a, a thing.
3630660	3631660	Right.
3631660	3635820	Cause they were, cause you saying they were, one kid was naked and the other kid was examining
3635820	3636820	him.
3636820	3637820	I don't remember exactly.
3637820	3641260	There, there was, there, there was, they were in some phase of undress.
3641260	3642380	There was something happening.
3642380	3645740	And when I opened the door, they were definitely like ashamed about what was going on, but
3645740	3650540	it clearly was really innocent and they weren't trying to like make their bodies feel good
3650540	3651540	or anything.
3651540	3652540	That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
3652540	3657140	The book of Genesis and so many origin stories like that, that awareness, like self awareness
3657140	3662700	and where it intersects with primal childhood, sexual awareness, the, the, the Freudian impulse
3662700	3670240	and all this stuff where it's, it's all about this idea that we were born innocent and,
3670260	3676440	but we have some kind of our awareness of ourselves and who we are is simultaneous with
3676440	3685460	this like possibility of punishment, the shame, the, the, the, the, the, the idea of like,
3685460	3689360	that we mythologize, like we have these gods that are like parents that they like, they,
3689360	3691760	they do the, they do the exact same thing.
3691760	3697360	They come into a bedroom and they catch us being people and they say, and then we immediately
3697400	3704880	not before that person's eyeballs touch us, but after like, like, like before that we're
3704880	3705880	innocent.
3705880	3706880	We're playing doctor.
3706880	3709200	We, we, we, we, we're just having fun.
3709200	3710720	We're following our bliss.
3710720	3716500	And then it's this moment when these adult eyeballs like see us and we, even before the
3716500	3721320	adult reacts, we go, Oh, I'm a horrible creature.
3721320	3722320	What am I doing?
3722320	3724720	Like, like, like, like this must look terrible to you.
3724720	3726160	I can't explain this.
3726160	3728360	This isn't what it looks like.
3728360	3734800	I think that's really fascinating because humans are inherently infantile as primates.
3734800	3739420	We retain infantile characteristics into adulthood, which is why we survived.
3739420	3744380	And so we're essentially like puppies or kittens or baby chimps, like our whole lives.
3744380	3750120	And we have these mythologies where that because we're neurotic and we, we, we have these mythologies
3750120	3754640	where we have these parents from the clouds that walk into our bedrooms and go, what are
3754640	3755640	you doing?
3755640	3760560	And we all, we all tell each other at 40 years old, we go like, well, you know, we're pieces
3760560	3761560	of shit.
3761560	3762560	Like, what are you doing?
3762560	3764960	We should, well, we should pass a law against this.
3764960	3769160	And of course, and it's all, all behind is like these little kids playing doctor.
3769160	3773960	It's like, like, Oh, we all know our little wieners and our little cracks are, are, are
3773960	3778920	filthy little pieces of shit, like horrible things that exude toxicity and that touching
3778920	3783680	them makes us bad people in one way or another that basically underneath our clothes where
3783680	3788880	terrible, gross, slimy little organisms that are horrible for thinking about ourselves
3788880	3790000	and each other.
3790000	3792400	We all, we all, we all agree on that, right?
3792400	3794360	So now let's get down to the Senate hearing.
3794360	3798080	And it's like, like, like we put a, we've got neckties on and we're talking about balancing
3798080	3800600	budgets and how are you going to do this and protect each other from that?
3800600	3803680	But it's like, we're just little babies that just want to like look at each other's little
3803680	3804680	no-no's.
3804680	3805680	All right.
3805680	3806680	All right.
3806680	3807680	Dan has four points.
3807680	3808680	And Andrew has two.
3808680	3809680	All right.
3809680	3817800	I believe this whole time, the whole audience was like, fuck, what are they going to get
3817800	3820040	back to that game?
3820040	3821040	Jesus Christ.
3821040	3823960	It's like the dukes of hazards, like just jumped over the ramp.
3823960	3827760	How are they going to land?
3827760	3829360	All right.
3829360	3830960	Uh, that was my joke.
3830960	3831960	All right.
3831960	3836120	So from, from now on, I'm just going to ask each of you individual questions and we're
3836120	3840320	not going to have each of you answer the question.
3840320	3843000	So Dan, this is your question.
3843000	3844000	Here we go.
3844000	3849120	Uh, my ultimate dream vacation would be going on a cattle drive with my closest friends
3849120	3855440	where we heard cattle on horseback and sit around a campfire every night and share secrets.
3855440	3861440	Or I would really love to just randomly explore different countries, different foreign countries
3861440	3862440	on a whim.
3862440	3864120	Maybe I'd start with Morocco.
3864120	3867440	Uh, you're the cattle drive.
3867440	3868440	Yay!
3868440	3869440	Yay!
3869440	3870440	All right.
3870440	3871440	Here we go.
3871440	3872440	Andrew.
3872440	3884040	Uh, the, the applause has become like, uh, it's just like, like, like, like water dripping
3884040	3887040	out of a bad shower head.
3887040	3889040	Okay.
3890040	3891040	Okay.
3891040	3892040	Here we go.
3892040	3893040	Next question.
3893040	3900160	My favorite color is A, yellow, all sunshine, all of the time, or B, red, more specifically
3900160	3902200	an orangish red, like persimmon.
3902200	3905240	Uh, the red, the orangish red.
3905240	3906240	Yellow.
3906240	3909240	That is correct, Andrew.
3909240	3910240	Andrew?
3910240	3911240	Andrew's correct?
3911240	3912240	Yeah.
3912240	3913240	Oh.
3913240	3914240	Whoops.
3914240	3915240	So that was for me.
3915240	3916240	Just going through that.
3916240	3917240	Yeah.
3917240	3918240	It is persimmon.
3918240	3919240	All right.
3919240	3926880	Next question, uh, my least favorite mode of transportation is A, driving, I love my
3926880	3931560	car but other cars scare me, or B, a cruise ship.
3931560	3933280	This is Dan's, Dan's question.
3933280	3934280	Cruise ship.
3934280	3935280	That is correct.
3935280	3936280	Good job.
3936280	3937280	All right.
3937280	3938280	Andrew.
3938280	3955300	If I was reincarnated as a building, I would be A, a brown brick pottery studio with cherry
3955300	3962760	wood floors and stained glass windows, or B, an amazing 100 year old observatory on
3962760	3963760	a hilltop.
3963760	3967640	Well, you put amazing in the second one.
3967640	3971040	So I would have to think it'd be the one that's amazing.
3971040	3972960	Nope.
3972960	3973960	Caroline is amazing.
3973960	3974960	Good job.
3974960	3975960	All right.
3975960	3976960	Obviously.
3976960	3989720	Um, so here we're at, we're at five points and, and, uh, and five points.
3989720	3994920	The, I, uh, I, I love, I loved the conversation about the kid's psychology.
3994920	3996320	I thought that was great.
3996320	3997320	Yeah.
3997320	3998320	Questions left.
3998320	4007880	We'll just do one more question, um, about, uh, how I choose to die if I got to choose
4007880	4009880	how I died.
4009880	4017160	And this is for both of you, uh, a, uh, bravely pilot a spaceship filled with evil people
4017160	4018320	into the sun.
4018320	4019480	They celebrate that.
4019480	4025760	They celebrate that every day that every year they celebrate that day every year with festive
4025760	4028400	cakes and amazing parties and all of my favorite music.
4028400	4033360	Oh, and I pilot that spaceship into the sun, uh, when I'm ancient and ready to go anyway,
4033360	4039920	or B I get drunk on Prosecco and Aperol and fall asleep in a vat of marshmallow fluff.
4039920	4044520	When I sleep while I sleep, I, I sink deeper into the fluff and eventually suffocate in
4044520	4049480	my sleep.
4049480	4053200	I think you, I think you want to drive evil people into the sun and be celebrated with
4053200	4054200	cake.
4054200	4055200	Yeah.
4055200	4056200	That's the way to go.
4056200	4057200	No, no.
4057200	4059960	I want to get drunk and pass out on a personal.
4059960	4060960	All right.
4060960	4066160	Well, I was going to say, I kind of admire the other person, but okay, I'm glad you learned
4066160	4067160	something every day.
4067160	4068160	That's good.
4068160	4069160	All right.
4069160	4070160	Thank you.
4070160	4071160	That was the game.
4071160	4072160	Yay.
4072160	4085120	Um, uh, I am having an out of body experience.
4085120	4086120	She's leaving.
4086120	4087120	Okay.
4087120	4088120	Caroline, everybody.
4088120	4089120	Caroline, everybody.
4089120	4090120	And Andrew.
4090120	4091120	Thank you.
4091120	4092120	Thank you.
4092120	4093120	Thank you, Caroline.
4093120	4094120	Thank you, Andrew.
4094120	4095120	All right.
4095120	4096120	You guys were awesome.
4096120	4097120	Let's bring Spencer to the stage.
4097120	4098120	Spencer Kritman.
4098120	4099120	Get up here.
4099120	4100120	Oh God.
4100120	4101120	Oh shit.
4101120	4102120	Oh fuck.
4102120	4105120	Leaping like a gazelle.
4105120	4122760	We did it and we're doing it.
4122760	4123760	You know what?
4123760	4124760	I hate you guys.
4124760	4125760	I hate when I cough.
4125760	4130920	I cough like this and people bless me like I'm sneezing.
4130920	4133520	It's the worst fucking thing on the planet.
4133520	4137040	I can't, I can't elaborate how much I hate it.
4137040	4138040	It doesn't make sense.
4138040	4143440	It's someone being thoughtful about me, but it pisses me off.
4143440	4147760	Because you're worried that because your cough is being misinterpreted as a sneeze that maybe
4147760	4149560	there's something medically wrong with you.
4149560	4152240	No worry has literally nothing to do with it.
4152240	4154240	Well, what pisses you off about it?
4154240	4155840	Uh, that they're wrong.
4155840	4157840	I'm not sneezing.
4157840	4159440	You fucking idiot.
4160240	4165040	You strike me as a person who probably already has fundamental problems with the whole sneezing,
4165040	4168000	bless you, gazoon-type thing because that's not logical at all.
4168000	4169000	Yeah, exactly.
4169000	4170480	So I'd rather no one said anything.
4170480	4177120	And now when you're doing it in the wrong situation, what the fuck, man?
4177120	4178120	It's not okay.
4178120	4179120	It's terrible.
4179120	4181560	Did that just happen right before you came on stage?
4181560	4184800	No, it happens every fucking day of my life.
4184800	4188500	There's a poetic irony there because I'm sure, it's like if you sneeze and someone
4188500	4190580	says bless you, what's your reaction?
4190580	4191580	Do you think fuck you?
4191580	4192580	Yeah.
4192580	4193580	Now I have to respond?
4193580	4194580	What?
4194580	4196780	Thank you for saying something at me that I didn't ask?
4196780	4198100	Fuck off.
4198100	4203780	It's like now I have to play a politician and be like, oh yes, that's what you're supposed
4203780	4204780	to do.
4204780	4205780	Good job, human.
4205780	4208060	I once sneezed in my twenties.
4208060	4213220	I sneezed and my girlfriend's sister said, bless you.
4213220	4215180	And you were like, never again.
4215180	4216780	No, no, no.
4216780	4220860	We went about our business and then five seconds later she went, uh, you're welcome.
4220860	4221860	Yeah.
4221860	4225460	And I was like, wait a minute, what?
4225460	4229060	What kind of endless chain of fucking rules are we engaged in?
4229060	4234300	It's very hard for her to say, bless you, difficult task.
4234300	4236380	It's like, I didn't know those were one of the rules.
4236380	4239100	You know what else is weird and uncomfortable?
4239100	4246060	When you check into a hotel and you go into the bathroom to take a nice hotel dump and
4246060	4250460	you spy something on the door, that is a small stain.
4250460	4253180	Now, I mean, I don't need a clean hotel room.
4253180	4254180	Trust me.
4254180	4259580	It could be as stained as possible, but this stain was right at about waist level.
4259580	4265660	Like if one was standing up in front of the toilet facing the door, perhaps a male.
4265660	4267100	I'm saying it was semen.
4267100	4271020	There was semen on the door of my hotel room, not in Houston.
4271020	4272020	You guys are great.
4272020	4279420	I've never seen this happen, but no one's ever going to mistake your stains for Austin
4279420	4280420	stains.
4280420	4285700	I may sometimes call you the rock city, but if I'm looking at a cum stain, I know I'm
4285700	4287700	in Austin.
4287700	4288700	Yeah.
4288700	4294380	I mean, I don't really have anywhere to go with that because I just let it slide.
4294380	4296900	Cause you're, you're, you're in your bathroom.
4296900	4301980	You're saying at waist height, if you're, you're facing the door, someone stood up
4301980	4304980	from the toilet and jerked up at the door.
4304980	4305980	Yeah.
4305980	4306980	To shoot onto the door.
4306980	4307980	Why would anyone ever do that?
4307980	4313460	Why would anyone invite themselves over to Dustin Marshall's house as a friend and do
4313460	4316380	that to his closet door?
4316380	4318440	Because that's something that apparently people do.
4318440	4319740	It's not cool, but it happens.
4319740	4322380	Wait, are you saying that people come on Dustin's door?
4322380	4323380	Yeah.
4323380	4324980	Every day I make a killing.
4324980	4326380	Wait, what?
4326380	4327380	I charge.
4327380	4328900	I charge people.
4329900	4330900	Dustin is shrugging.
4330900	4332780	Like you're making all of this up.
4332780	4333780	Well I am.
4333780	4336260	I don't charge people to come on his closet door.
4336260	4338340	Dustin, Dustin, can you come over for a second?
4338340	4339340	Yes.
4339340	4343260	Dustin Marshall, everybody.
4343260	4346980	This involves cum and also you, you help us to the podcast.
4346980	4347980	Dustin Marshall.
4347980	4348980	Hi.
4348980	4354900	We've turned into Howard Stern now cause you're like Baba Booey.
4354900	4355900	I am the Baba Booey.
4355900	4357900	I want to be Fred, but I'm Baba Booey.
4357900	4363380	So Dustin, your friends come over and instead of bringing a bottle of wine, they come on
4363380	4364380	your closet door.
4364380	4365780	So Spencer told me this story.
4365780	4370540	It was kind of amazing that first you were in a hotel room and you switched.
4370540	4374180	Yeah, cause it was a non-smoking room that smelled like cigarettes and I thought that
4374180	4376660	if I stayed, they'd charge me 500 bucks.
4376660	4381740	And so you asked to go to a different room and then upon the room you went in, you noticed
4381740	4383460	just a jizz stain on the back of the door.
4383460	4385660	And I should clarify, it wasn't just a stain.
4385660	4389220	Like it was like the desiccated crust.
4389220	4393240	All that was remaining after all fluids have evaporated out of it.
4393240	4396580	Just like a cobweb.
4396580	4398420	Something you recognized as cum.
4398420	4399420	Oh no.
4399420	4403700	I mean, I had to taste it before I was sure.
4403700	4404700	That's when I knew.
4404700	4405700	Wait.
4405700	4406700	Wait.
4406700	4407700	So, okay.
4407700	4408700	All right.
4408700	4412980	So he told me this story and I used to be in a band when I was like 15 and all the guys
4412980	4416180	in my band were a little bit older than me and we never hung out at my house.
4416180	4418060	So they're like, why don't we hang out at your house?
4418060	4419060	And I was like, okay.
4419060	4423100	So they came over and I was like cooking a frozen pizza upstairs for them.
4423100	4424100	For them.
4424100	4425420	I checked my America online.
4425420	4429700	I was kind of taking my time and they were all downstairs, like hanging out.
4429700	4433700	And then I went downstairs, they ate the pizza and they're all like later and they all, they
4433700	4435220	all coasted.
4435220	4439100	And then that means left, they left.
4439100	4451660	For those of you who are aren't Ninja Turtles or background actors in a honeycomb commercial,
4451660	4452660	they left.
4452660	4453660	All right.
4453660	4454660	They left.
4454660	4459100	And in case, sorry, let me clarify.
4459100	4465660	If you haven't recently been rollerblading in a sunny delight commercial, what happened
4465660	4467340	is they left.
4467340	4473260	They left the premises, but they did it like they ate the pizza and then they left.
4473260	4478020	And then so then my phone rang at my house and I answered it and they were just all on
4478020	4480100	speaker phone laughing.
4480100	4482100	And they're like, look in your closet.
4482100	4484280	I had this weird like walking closet.
4484280	4487940	And then on the back of the door, I was upstairs for maybe 15 minutes.
4487940	4488940	There's three guys.
4488940	4495420	They took turns jacking off in my closet and then ejaculating on the back of my door.
4495420	4496420	And next.
4496420	4499940	So there was visibly all this different semen on the back of my door.
4499940	4501540	All these dried semen.
4501540	4506300	No, no, it was it was dried, but the bottom wasn't like it was the top.
4506300	4507300	Yeah, yeah.
4507300	4513220	This is why little boys need to know and this stuff when they're kids, how is it the first
4513220	4514220	time I'm on the show?
4514220	4515860	This is what it is.
4515860	4516860	Okay.
4516860	4518540	Is there more to the story?
4518540	4519540	Is there?
4519540	4522300	Because I'm if you're done with that story, I need you to tell a different story.
4522300	4524820	Tell us about in New York with the cops.
4525100	4526100	No, wait, come on.
4526100	4527100	Hold on.
4527100	4528100	Okay, sure.
4528100	4531340	This is I mean, because we can't the cops just heard this story.
4531340	4536060	But three guys that came over to your house came on your there were my best friends and
4536060	4538660	then they were like, shropping me in the worst way.
4538660	4542100	I don't understand how they literally came into the house.
4542100	4544940	They rapidly like on walked out of the room.
4544940	4547020	They like you guys like Velveeta.
4547020	4548260	I'll go get some slices.
4548260	4549260	Don't coast.
4549260	4550260	And you left.
4550260	4551260	Don't.
4552180	4557580	And they and they all must have exchanged a look like, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
4557580	4558580	No.
4558580	4559580	Hey, hey.
4559580	4560580	What?
4560580	4561580	What?
4561580	4562580	It was.
4562580	4563580	There was not one among them.
4563580	4565780	It was like, guys, guys, guys.
4565780	4567100	What have we become?
4567100	4571900	I feel like they must have come to his house with the no, they have a plan meeting.
4571900	4572900	It was great.
4572900	4573900	Or something.
4573900	4574900	It was preplanned.
4574900	4575900	Let's go.
4575900	4580580	When you said come to his house, I thought you meant they came to the idea of Dustin's
4580580	4583900	house like while they're jerking off in order to come.
4583900	4585140	It was a walk in.
4585140	4586140	It was a walk in closet.
4586140	4587140	I mean, come on.
4587140	4588140	That's what it is.
4588140	4589140	The stone.
4589140	4590140	The cement.
4590140	4591140	Look at this.
4591140	4592140	The island.
4592140	4593140	The kitchen.
4593140	4594140	Oh, God.
4594140	4599700	The through with the feng shui.
4599700	4604780	But it was it was it was like non-sexual was just aggressive and it was meant to.
4604780	4605780	It was vandalism.
4605780	4606780	It was vandalism.
4606780	4609660	But at some point it had to be sexual for them.
4609660	4612660	They had to come thinking about something.
4612660	4613660	And I can.
4613660	4614660	Not when you're 15.
4614660	4616260	They must have been coming.
4616260	4617660	Thinking about was each other.
4617660	4618660	Yeah.
4618660	4619660	Great friends.
4619660	4620660	They were.
4620660	4621660	Yeah.
4621660	4622660	It's a little bromothobic.
4622660	4625340	At that age, you just poke your dick and it starts spurtin.
4625340	4628980	I mean, you don't have to think about sexual things.
4628980	4635020	You're 15 and knowing is half the battle.
4635020	4639620	If you're listening, just poke it and it'll do the rest.
4640580	4641580	Yeah.
4641580	4642580	I am aware of that.
4642580	4649380	But I would always still I had to think about like She-Ra or, you know, Penny from Inspector
4649380	4652380	Gadget whose I was her age.
4652380	4657700	So it was OK.
4657700	4661420	There was always something I was thinking about while I was.
4661420	4663980	It's just one of your friends are like, let's do it.
4663980	4666700	Let's let's they must have had some phrase for it, too.
4666700	4672780	They had to have shorthand like, let's let's cream pie is closet, bro.
4672780	4675420	This must have been like the seventh person they've done this to.
4675420	4684980	Let's Narnia dust it specifically.
4684980	4685980	That's it.
4685980	4686980	God.
4686980	4687980	Let's Narnia.
4687980	4688980	Like lately.
4688980	4698420	You guys don't know it's our entire travel is is made up of razzing me.
4698420	4704700	I was going to say, Dan and I are going to love Dan and I love making fun of Dustin.
4704700	4709220	Maybe they just were like us and they were just had so much joy.
4709220	4713780	I would never come on anything that Dustin anyone ever owned.
4713780	4716940	I would never do that as a way of asserting my ego.
4717380	4718380	I would never go.
4718380	4722980	Hey, I came on something like what I would do is, you know, you know, it came on everything
4722980	4729060	in my home because it was the same guy like he he we would hang out at his house all the
4729060	4734300	time and then he had a couch and then he had cable TV so he could like order movies and
4734300	4735300	stuff.
4735300	4738460	So there was an area of his couch that was like three feet in diameter that was just
4738460	4740060	like brown and black.
4740060	4742260	And then we were like, what's wrong with your carpet?
4742260	4744340	He's like, oh, that's where I jerk off.
4744340	4747980	Like he would lean against his couch with his arm up and then he would come all over
4747980	4750900	his floor for years.
4750900	4752580	And it was just a diameter.
4752580	4753580	He never cleaned it up.
4753580	4757300	So this is the person we're talking about something.
4757300	4758300	I'm from Wisconsin.
4758300	4764380	I feel like you grew up in the the one character in Grand Theft Auto five, the guy that from
4764380	4767340	the Inland Empire, like what's that guy like?
4767340	4768340	Yeah.
4768340	4769340	Oh my God.
4769340	4772460	That sounds like I mean, here's the thing.
4772460	4773700	Here's the truth.
4773700	4785860	As a teenage boy, like I came a lot and I did.
4785860	4792340	I do think that teenage boys like I think you think that you're the only one coming
4792340	4793340	that much.
4793340	4798300	And I do think you license yourself to be like, well, this is my we do all kinds of
4798300	4803540	weird stuff because nobody's telling us there is no class where the gym teacher says, guys,
4803540	4806140	you're going to come everywhere all the time.
4806140	4807140	Use a Kleenex.
4807140	4810220	What would that class be called?
4810220	4811220	Sex Ed.
4811220	4812220	But it's not.
4812220	4815780	It's always your gym teacher going, hey, you're going to go through some changes.
4815780	4818460	My nipples got hard.
4818460	4819460	Fuck off.
4819460	4820460	Here's a film from the 60s.
4820460	4824500	It's called it's called Little Boy, Little Man.
4825500	4829660	And it would just be like a diagram of your balls filling up with come and you'd be like,
4829660	4831460	yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
4831460	4832460	I know.
4832460	4834420	And then you'd go home and deal with it.
4834420	4839380	I dealt with it against the door of my bedroom.
4839380	4841060	It was supposed to be like punk rock.
4841060	4842460	We're in a punk rock band.
4842460	4846500	So they were supposed to be it was supposed to be like a punk rock thing, I guess.
4846500	4847500	But they were gross.
4847500	4848500	That's what the dead Kennedys did.
4848500	4849980	I don't hang out with any of them anymore.
4849980	4850980	I know.
4850980	4853780	They jizzed on everyone's closet doors.
4854060	4855980	It became a huge thing for a while.
4855980	4856980	All right.
4856980	4858340	So we got to the bottom.
4858340	4859740	Your friends were crazy.
4859740	4861460	They were they were full of common.
4861460	4864500	They felt like it was a way to express themselves.
4864500	4865500	Thanks.
4865500	4866500	OK.
4866500	4867500	I want to hear the New York City thing, though.
4867500	4868500	Which one?
4868500	4869980	You guys with the cops.
4869980	4872380	The cop in my car in the Uber.
4872380	4873380	Yeah.
4873380	4875220	Oh, I was in New York City.
4875220	4876220	Really quick.
4876220	4880900	Can I just play a very appropriate music bed very low underneath the story?
4880900	4887500	And she doesn't have a great record for this like it may just be like a flight of the
4887500	4888500	bumblebee.
4888500	4891020	That'd be good.
4891020	4892540	Or maybe it will be great.
4892540	4896060	And and and Dan will look at me and be like teammate.
4896060	4897060	I will.
4897060	4901980	I definitely will be very excited to control the volume, though.
4901980	4904580	Just go for it.
4904580	4905580	OK.
4905580	4910180	So I was in New York for Harmon town and then I kind of got dropped off and I was kind of
4910180	4912940	left my own device and I was there for like a day and a half.
4912940	4918340	And then I was like, oh, man, everybody in New York is really cool and collected and
4918340	4920500	stylish and nice like in L.A.
4920500	4923700	I just hear people bitching out loud and yelling at people all the time.
4923700	4930540	And then I got an Uber and I was going to a bar and then what is this?
4930540	4931540	Breaking Bad.
4931540	4932540	Oh, cool.
4932540	4934660	And then I was going to a bar.
4934660	4939020	My Uber driver, I was in an SUV and we were stuck in traffic.
4939020	4943180	And then he wanted to take a right turn and there was a New York City cop just standing
4943180	4944180	in the middle of it.
4944180	4946660	And my Uber driver is like, yo, he's like, this guy lives right here.
4946660	4947660	Can I just go?
4947660	4948780	He's like, fuck you.
4948780	4949780	Fuck you.
4949780	4950780	The cop.
4950780	4951780	The cop starts in.
4951780	4952780	So the windows down.
4952780	4953780	He's like, this guy lives right here.
4953780	4954780	And he's like, fuck you.
4954780	4955780	Show me your license.
4955780	4956780	Show me your license.
4956780	4957780	You live here.
4957780	4958780	And he was in the car grabbing at me.
4958780	4960220	He's like, show me your license.
4960220	4962420	Show me your fucking license.
4962420	4967180	And then it was like I just sat there frozen and I was like not showing my license.
4967180	4971500	And then the Uber driver drove away and he goes, he goes, I'm so sick of this.
4971500	4975660	Like the NYPD, like whenever they're doing something crooked, they just shut down a street.
4975660	4979380	Whenever there's something they don't want you to see, they'll just shut down streets.
4979380	4980700	That's the story I told Spencer.
4980700	4984620	I think it's an amazing story that needed to be podcast.
4984620	4985620	Okay.
4985620	4992380	But but and then like next 24 hours I I was hanging out with a Harmon town fan and there
4992380	4996260	was a homeless guy on a bench and he was like calling her a cunt and a whore and stuff.
4996260	4997260	So I was like, oh, okay.
4997260	4999100	I got a dose of the New York City thing.
4999100	5003220	You were saying, where's a cop when you need them?
5003220	5004220	But yeah, yeah.
5004220	5005220	Spencer is all right.
5005220	5009260	Why are you using the C word for this lovely lady?
5009260	5015460	Spencer is, you know, very active in the the awareness of police brutality.
5015460	5016460	Spencer hates cops.
5016460	5018700	No, we all like I thought I did.
5018700	5022580	I mean, sir, I think I hate cops less than I portray, to be honest.
5022580	5025540	I just the crimes need to be publicized.
5025780	5031460	Yeah, I think that I think that probably you and I would both agree that there's probably
5031460	5034620	I don't there's a good chance if there's 200 people in the theater.
5034620	5038100	One of them might be a cop and he's probably a good cop by the numbers, maybe a really
5038100	5039100	great guy.
5039100	5044180	I might like hang out and talk and be a human being and actually be a wonderful person.
5044180	5047420	I bet like cops by default do wonderful things.
5047420	5048420	Yeah.
5048420	5050420	One of my best friends is a cop.
5051420	5060700	I mean, I think that the general the general way in which we approach the policing of humanity
5060700	5061700	is flawed.
5061700	5062700	Yeah, it could be better.
5062700	5068100	And it is expressed in individual moments through a random person who has been given
5068100	5072660	either too much or too little power in some situation and is expressing his grief with
5072660	5076340	that in a really inappropriate way.
5076340	5077940	The system is broken.
5077940	5078940	Definitely.
5078940	5085020	I personally don't like the idea that insurance is somehow involved in law.
5085020	5091700	I have a big problem with the incredibly intricate, weird rating of capitalism and government.
5091700	5097220	I think it's weird that we have these papers called insurance in our glove boxes.
5097220	5100820	And if you don't have them, you're not allowed to drive and a guy with a gun could pull you
5100820	5106660	over and tap on your window and ask to see proof that you're sponsored by a corporation
5106660	5111300	to drive in case you collide with another corporate sponsored individual.
5111300	5115300	And I don't like the fact that when we have a problem with this stuff, everyone defaults
5115300	5120180	to these human like issues and says like, well, have you ever been hit by a person that
5120180	5122780	doesn't have insurance because it really sucks.
5122780	5126940	My brother's spine got all fucked up and the other driver didn't have insurance.
5126940	5127940	It's fucked up.
5127940	5131660	Like, no, that's not proof that we need to exist in a flawed system.
5131660	5135700	That's just you saying it sucks that a system sucks.
5135700	5141540	And that united flight shit, when you go, oh, yeah, everyone overbooks their flights
5141540	5142540	because they're all fucked up.
5142540	5147140	And then people are tweeting at me like, oh, all airlines overbook their flights because
5147140	5149620	of no shows.
5149620	5151900	We criminalize the human population.
5151900	5154740	We constantly look at each other as the problem.
5154740	5156580	How could we be the problem?
5156580	5159980	We're the fucking end and beginning of it all.
5159980	5162680	We invented systems so that we could be who we are.
5162680	5164260	How could we ever be the problem?
5164260	5168180	Why are we constantly looking at each other and saying like, hey, yeah, you know why they
5168180	5169180	have to do that?
5169180	5171820	Because some people will come on your door.
5171820	5174900	Like, you know, it's for door comers.
5174900	5175900	They have to do that.
5175900	5180300	It's like if the hotel, like if we went to a hotel and there was like you couldn't get
5180300	5185460	into the bathroom without like unzipping a zipper or like calling for permission to go
5185460	5189980	pee, like you might as well live and it's like we go, oh, why do we have to do that?
5189980	5193620	They go, you know about door comers.
5193620	5195180	Spencer had somebody come on his door.
5195180	5196780	No, we don't live in that.
5196780	5199860	Like Spencer had to go into a bathroom and he had to look at come on his bathroom door
5199860	5202020	and it's like, oh, it's something that happened to him.
5202020	5207080	Like we could, anyone can pretend, anyone can bring up some weird scenario.
5207080	5209400	It's like, oh no, humans are the criminals.
5209400	5210500	Humans are the bad people.
5210500	5212360	Humans are the things you need to defend against.
5212360	5213940	Fucking are you kidding me?
5213940	5215600	Systems are the things you need to defend against.
5215600	5217080	Those things will fuck you over.
5217080	5220120	Those things aren't human, therefore cannot fail.
5220120	5222300	They will only get better at being systems.
5222300	5225220	Like people are only good at being people.
5225220	5229380	They will only ever get weaker and weaker as their systems get more and more successful.
5229380	5231060	You have to guard against systems.
5231060	5232700	You have to be skeptical of them.
5232700	5236340	You have to look at politicians and say, you're probably full of shit.
5236340	5241140	I don't care how much you impress me, you're always probably full of shit.
5241140	5243980	If you represent anything, you must be full of shit.
5243980	5248940	I will assume that first and you can impress me later and yet we don't do that.
5248940	5252580	In our comment sections and all this stuff, we always blame each other.
5252580	5257380	We're always so angry at each other for being poor and being fallible and being human.
5257380	5258380	We get so mad.
5258380	5262300	We go like, you know these fuck faces and fucking bad assholes and we're talking about
5262300	5263380	our neighbors.
5263380	5264860	We're talking about each other.
5264860	5265860	It drives me nuts.
5265860	5269380	It makes me want to punch you all in the face because you're all assholes.
5269380	5273780	Well, I think you're taught to hate your neighbor.
5273780	5275200	Your neighbor makes too much noise.
5275200	5276200	You call the cops.
5276200	5277780	Your neighbor's tree grows over your yard.
5277780	5278780	You call the cops.
5278780	5280220	By the way, the cops never show up.
5280220	5283780	The tree situation never gets rectified, but you get conditioned that that's what you're
5283780	5284780	supposed to do.
5284780	5286500	You're supposed to tell on your neighbor to the teacher.
5286500	5288180	You're not supposed to go work it out with them.
5288180	5289600	You're supposed to call this number.
5289600	5291580	The number never fucking solves anything.
5291580	5295020	It doesn't solve anything, but that's the only thing you're supposed to do.
5295020	5299220	Because if you got along with your neighbors, like if you policed your own block and you
5299220	5300340	saw cops doing fucking shit.
5300340	5301340	That's called anarchy.
5301340	5302340	Yeah, yeah.
5302340	5303340	That is called terrorism.
5303340	5304340	Yeah, exactly.
5304340	5305340	That is not allowed.
5305340	5306740	That's not government.
5306740	5307740	That doesn't work.
5307740	5313420	If your block had its own identity, if you were the 1700 block of Fifth Street and nothing
5313420	5319380	came between your neighbors and the outside world, that's called fucking sovereignty.
5319380	5322340	That's called like self actualization of a community.
5322340	5323740	That's what gang members get right.
5323740	5327020	Because like they take over blocks and cops won't go there.
5327020	5328020	Cops won't go there.
5328020	5331020	We're advocating everything that will get us arrested.
5331020	5336980	We should all just let our neighbors coast where they want to coast.
5336980	5339580	That's why this great city of Austin is so great.
5339580	5340580	Houston.
5340580	5343580	Oh shit.
5343580	5348140	I have a scientific question for the three of you.
5348140	5350620	Just in time.
5350620	5353380	The come on the door.
5353380	5355780	You saw the come on the door.
5355780	5358060	I don't ejaculate.
5358060	5359060	You don't.
5359060	5360060	I don't.
5360060	5361580	And I don't know if I would.
5361580	5364460	It's not something that would stick out to me in the same way that when you learn a new
5364460	5366500	word you hear it all the time.
5367020	5369900	Do you see come on things all the time?
5369900	5373580	Am I going to start seeing come on things?
5373580	5377580	We all come on things at an early age and so it's easy to recognize when you're coming
5377580	5378580	on things all the time.
5378580	5379580	I think that's correct.
5379580	5383140	But I mean like at the hotel room are you like oh cool come or like on the stage or
5383140	5384140	like I mean is it everywhere?
5384140	5385140	Not cool.
5385140	5386140	No, no, no.
5386140	5387140	Where does it stop?
5387140	5389180	Well you know the whole black light thing.
5389180	5392500	Like when you run a black light over a hotel room you can spot semen and it's like an
5392500	5393500	epidemic.
5393500	5394500	It's an Spencer situation.
5394500	5395500	It was just there.
5395500	5396500	It's not a hard copy.
5396500	5402220	I'm wondering if I see it and I think it's like plaster of Paris or something.
5402220	5403660	I think you know when you see it.
5403660	5405220	I don't know.
5405220	5411780	You can mistake it for a few things like I don't know like old clear shower gel or maybe
5411780	5413780	an overly viscous spittle.
5413780	5414780	I do.
5414780	5415780	I see that.
5415780	5420580	I know that I have been in bathrooms and hotels before and been like they really should control
5420580	5421580	their.
5421580	5422580	Come.
5422580	5430100	I think Justin said it exactly right.
5430100	5431100	Did you say it?
5431100	5436340	It's it's when you have a vague memory from your little kid and you're coming 900 times
5436340	5438340	a day.
5438340	5442420	That's when you're coming inappropriately and you come in weird places.
5442420	5448020	So you actually do remember what it looks like when it's it and what it looks like from
5448020	5450020	500 feet away.
5450020	5455460	But I think as you get older you come less and less and you also you come in more appropriate
5455460	5456460	places.
5456460	5463660	And so you know actually I mean you'd have to go to like a I yeah I don't well now I'm
5463660	5468580	going to get into a way it say it no no I don't do it no I was going to go down a road
5468580	5470740	of like where would you see 12 year olds come.
5470740	5472780	I don't know why why your own eyes.
5472780	5473780	I don't know.
5473780	5474780	Okay.
5474780	5477140	I don't know what situation you'd be in.
5477260	5479100	This is what happens when you bring me on stage.
5479100	5480580	We're talking about 12 year old come.
5480580	5481580	All right.
5481580	5486380	Well Justin will you will you stay up here and play D&D with us.
5486380	5487380	This is crazy.
5487380	5488380	Yeah.
5488380	5489380	Sure.
5489380	5490380	All right.
5490380	5491380	This is insane.
5491380	5493380	Let me check the recorder.
5493380	5503420	One second.
5503420	5506420	And we need we need one more person to play D&D.
5507180	5510180	Is there somebody who's.
5510180	5511180	What's the category.
5511180	5512180	What do we.
5512180	5513180	Do we want to.
5513180	5514660	I mean do we pick someone randomly.
5514660	5515660	This is my worst nightmare.
5515660	5516660	This is what I hate about.
5516660	5521460	Well I mean people there there are some people where I know yeah pick someone.
5521460	5526660	Well I know I just but it's hard to pick people randomly and I feel like a weird Baptist
5526660	5533620	revival like I hate I hate choosing because then you're not choosing other people and
5533620	5535100	I don't know what criteria to use.
5535540	5537540	Do you want me to choose Spencer.
5537540	5538860	How would you choose if you were to choose.
5538860	5539860	All right.
5539860	5540860	Hold on.
5540860	5545300	I'm I'm I'm closing my eyes and I'm feeling the audience using his audience down dousing
5545300	5549060	rod who's behind this hand.
5549060	5550060	Oh shit.
5550060	5551060	It's that guy.
5551060	5552060	What guy.
5552060	5553060	That guy.
5553060	5554060	That guy standing up.
5554060	5555060	I'm sorry everybody.
5555060	5557060	I'm really sorry.
5557060	5562460	Well he ripped off that banded.
5562460	5564460	What is your name.
5564460	5568220	Nick Nick everybody.
5568220	5571060	Okay we're going to do a thing really quick though.
5571060	5572060	Good job Nick.
5572060	5574580	Everyone that had your hand raised raised your hand again.
5574580	5575580	Okay.
5575580	5576580	What's your name.
5576580	5577580	Nikki.
5577580	5578580	What's your deal.
5578580	5579580	Nothing.
5579580	5580580	Awesome.
5580580	5581580	How do you know when you're finished.
5581580	5582580	All right.
5582580	5583580	Hello sir.
5583580	5584580	What's your name.
5584580	5585580	Louise.
5585580	5586580	What's the best thing about you.
5586580	5587580	I have depression and I do improv.
5587580	5588580	You have depression and you do improv.
5588580	5591580	I was preparing for a different question.
5591580	5592580	I know.
5593220	5595220	I didn't mean to go around and put everybody on the spot.
5595220	5597220	I just I just wanted to touch everybody's soul.
5597220	5599220	Like just say anything.
5599220	5600220	Uh.

5616220	5617220	Well this is fine.
5617220	5619300	You're fine in Houston.
5619300	5620300	What's your name.
5620300	5621300	I'm Seth.
5621300	5622300	Hi Seth.
5623020	5624020	Hi.
5624020	5625020	I'm from Milwaukee.
5625020	5626020	Oh.
5626020	5627020	From Milwaukee.

5631020	5632020	Okay.
5632020	5633020	This is easy.
5633020	5634020	I'm Tim.
5634020	5635020	My parents got divorced today.
5635020	5636020	Oh your parents got divorced today.
5636020	5637020	Well broke the news.
5637020	5638020	My mom broke the news to my dad.
5638020	5639020	Why that asshole.
5639020	5640020	Oh Jesus.
5640020	5641020	All right.
5641020	5642020	Well good for your mom.
5642020	5643020	I'm gonna.
5643020	5644020	Yeah.
5644020	5645020	Well you're still pretty young.
5645020	5646020	How old are you?
5646020	5647020	23.
5647020	5650300	I'm gonna pay for my car because it's under my dad's insurance and I don't want to talk
5650300	5651300	to him.
5652300	5655300	How much do you have left to pay on it?
5655300	5656300	Five grand.
5656300	5657300	Five grand?
5657300	5658300	Yeah.
5658300	5659300	Jesus Christ.
5659300	5660300	Can't you just leave it on the street somewhere?
5660300	5661300	What's gonna happen?
5661300	5662300	Yeah.
5662300	5663300	But then you can't get another car.
5663300	5664300	All right.
5664300	5665300	Tough times for what's his name.
5665300	5666300	All right.
5666300	5667300	Dad's a cheating asshole.
5667300	5668300	What's up with you?
5668300	5672300	I'm Michael and I want to see if Spitz will use my dice for D&D.
5672300	5673300	Oh.
5673300	5675300	This guy wants you to use his dice for D&D.
5675300	5676300	I'll do it.
5676300	5677300	Yeah.
5677300	5678300	Okay.
5678300	5679300	All right.
5679300	5680300	Your name's Michael.
5680300	5682300	Michael's Dice.
5682300	5683300	Michael's Dice.
5683300	5687300	If you print Michael's Dice on the right font, that could win an Oscar as a screenplay.
5687300	5689300	Michael's Dice.
5689300	5692300	If Michael's terminally ill, that could be fantastic.
5692300	5696300	Denzel Washington is the uncle that comes up with a cure.
5696300	5698300	Michael's Dice.
5698300	5700300	And the winner is...
5700300	5702300	Toby Smith for Michael's Dice.
5702300	5703300	What's your name?
5703300	5704300	Isaiahs.
5704300	5705300	Isaiahs.
5705300	5708300	It's like just a plural of a regular name.
5708300	5709300	That's correct.
5709300	5712300	Your parents are like, your dad was like, should we name him Isaiah?
5712300	5714300	And your mom's like, not important enough.
5714300	5717300	He's like, how about Isaiahs?
5717300	5718300	That's exactly what happened.
5718300	5719300	All right.
5719300	5720300	What's going on with you?
5720300	5722300	You got the pulpit.
5722300	5726300	Well, my friend Matt couldn't show up, so I just want to say hi to Matt.
5726300	5727300	He had to go to work.
5727300	5728300	I told him to skip work, but he's...
5728300	5731300	Matt, you fucking suck.
5731300	5734300	He was hoping somebody would say something like that.
5734300	5736300	Where does Matt work?
5736300	5737300	He works at Kroger.
5737300	5738300	Kroger?
5738300	5739300	Yes.
5739300	5740300	Yeah.
5740300	5741300	What do they do?
5741300	5742300	They sound like they're an evil corporation.
5742300	5743300	They are.
5743300	5745300	They sell groceries and stuff.
5745300	5746300	Oh, Kroger.
5746300	5747300	Oh, Kroger.
5747300	5748300	Yeah.
5748300	5749300	Yeah.
5749300	5750300	Leonard.
5750300	5753300	Leonard gets his groceries there on Community.
5753300	5757300	But he calls it Kroger's because he's old.
5757300	5758300	He liked that.
5758300	5760300	That Leonard food reviews.
5760300	5761300	Come on.
5761300	5764300	You're a big fan of Community.
5764300	5766300	Leonard likes this.
5766300	5767300	Remember the Leonard food review?
5767300	5768300	Come on.
5768300	5769300	I'm really proud of you.
5769300	5770300	Come on.
5770300	5771300	Come on.
5771300	5772300	It's fantastic.
5772300	5774300	What's happening with you?
5774300	5779300	I'm a teenager, and I think I'm like the only teenager here for some reason.
5779300	5780300	But...
5780300	5788300	And your conversation was very uncomfortable.
5788300	5789300	Mike.
5789300	5791300	Your cum conversation was very uncomfortable.
5791300	5792300	Okay, yeah.
5792300	5796300	Well, our cum conversation made this teenager uncomfortable.
5796300	5799300	Like you're not coming right now.
5799300	5800300	I know.
5800300	5804300	It's for obvious reasons, and we don't feel sorry for you.
5804300	5806300	Bust a nut!
5806300	5810300	It's only uncomfortable because you're living the dream.
5810300	5813300	For the rest of us, it's just nostalgia.
5813300	5815300	No, sorry, kid.
5815300	5825300	I'm sure if you sued the show for warping your brain, my lawyer's first evidence would be everything on the internet.
5825300	5826300	Hello.
5826300	5827300	Hello.
5827300	5828300	I'm Ryan.
5828300	5829300	Ryan.
5829300	5832300	This is a weird conversation.
5832300	5834300	All right, what do you want me to talk about?
5834300	5835300	Anything you want.
5835300	5837300	I've just got the mic in your face.
5837300	5838300	All right, yeah.
5838300	5840300	I just wanted to say I really like Rick and Morty.
5840300	5843300	Me too.
5843300	5846300	Season two's coming soon.
5846300	5850300	What do you hope I didn't do wrong?
5850300	5852300	No, that's a dumb question.
5853300	5856300	I'm really nervous I fucked up the second season.
5856300	5860300	No, I know I nailed the first season, obviously.
5860300	5863300	I'm really, really worried about the second season.
5863300	5865300	I'm always worried about everything.
5865300	5866300	I think it'll be great.
5866300	5867300	I think it'll be great.
5867300	5868300	You guys are right.
5868300	5869300	It'll be fine.
5869300	5870300	It'll be fine.
5870300	5871300	It'll be great.
5871300	5873300	You saw one of the animatics at the convention, and you liked it.
5873300	5874300	It's fine.
5874300	5875300	You guys will be fine.
5875300	5877300	All right, what's happening over here?
5877300	5878300	I'm Thomas.
5878300	5880300	Speaking of Rick and Morty, can I...
5880300	5882300	Will you just give me Justin Roiland's phone number?
5882300	5883300	I just want to say hi to him.
5883300	5884300	I mean, I'm not...
5884300	5885300	Yeah.
5885300	5889300	No, you can't have Justin Roiland's phone number.
5889300	5892300	Because I would cut it on my profits.
5892300	5894300	Did someone tap me on the back?
5894300	5896300	Oh, I thought somebody...
5896300	5897300	Oh, you were comforting me.
5897300	5898300	Okay.
5898300	5900300	Because you're sitting next to the coming kid.
5900300	5901300	All right.
5901300	5905300	Dan, for the podcast listeners, is walking through every single aisle.
5905300	5907300	Probably about 20 aisles.
5907300	5908300	I'm a man.
5908300	5911300	It's easy to do at the Alamo draft house, because they have these nice, beautiful,
5911300	5912300	luxuriant aisles.
5912300	5913300	What's happening there?
5913300	5915300	I'm Ryan, too.
5915300	5916300	All right.
5916300	5917300	Ryan, too.
5917300	5918300	He's an android from the...
5918300	5921300	The Crab Nebula.
5921300	5923300	What's on your mind?
5923300	5924300	Good luck on your marriage.
5924300	5927300	I've been divorced twice, so...
5927300	5928300	Awesome.
5928300	5929300	Is there a mistake...
5929300	5932300	So it's a person who's made...
5932300	5934300	We don't want to call it a mistake.
5934300	5936300	I mean, you followed your heart.
5936300	5941300	Is there something that you did that we cannot do?
5941300	5944300	I like the metaphor about building the space together.
5944300	5945300	That's what you got to do.
5945300	5949300	Thinking about it as a third entity, as our couples therapist said,
5949300	5951300	you got you and you got the other person.
5951300	5952300	Those are individuals.
5952300	5953300	They can be fucked up.
5953300	5954300	They can...
5954300	5955300	They're whatever.
5955300	5958300	There's this third thing that's like a bank or a company.
5958300	5959300	It's an LLC.
5959300	5961300	You invest in it.
5961300	5962300	Yeah.
5962300	5964300	Kroger's.
5964300	5968300	It's a little Kroger's that you go to and you both...
5968300	5969300	Yeah.
5969300	5970300	That's what we're working on.
5970300	5971300	Do you...
5971300	5973300	Do your two divorces, do you ever think like,
5973300	5975300	oh man, one of those, I really fucked up.
5975300	5976300	I could've...
5976300	5977300	Like, do you think...
5977300	5982300	Or do you think, oh good, I'm glad both of those marriages are over.
5982300	5983300	Oh, geez.
5983300	5984300	You only have those two choices.
5984300	5985300	How old are you?
5985300	5987300	Thirty-eight.
5987300	5989300	What was with the first divorce where you're like,
5989300	5992300	I'm going to get married again?
5992300	5993300	The first...
5993300	5997300	The second marriage was the one that I thought was going to be the real one.
5997300	5998300	The inventory.
5998300	5999300	No, yeah.
5999300	6004300	The first one was I was a little young.
6004300	6006300	The second one was like, oh, I think I know what I'm doing now.
6006300	6007300	I got a tattoo now.
6007300	6008300	I got a convertible.
6008300	6009300	Now I'm getting married.
6009300	6010300	I got full control.
6010300	6012300	And then you're like, wait, what?
6012300	6013300	A woman?
6013300	6014300	Yeah.
6014300	6016300	It might work out the way I play.
6016300	6017300	Right.
6017300	6018300	So what's...
6018300	6021300	Do the two of them coupled together, like both of these experiences,
6021300	6025300	do you have any wisdom as a 38-year-old twice divorcee?
6025300	6026300	Don't...
6026300	6027300	Oh, Jesus.
6027300	6028300	Don't get married.
6028300	6029300	I think you were about to say.
6029300	6030300	No.
6030300	6033300	I was going to say, I have no wisdom.
6033300	6034300	Yeah.
6034300	6036300	I don't think he gained no wisdom.
6036300	6037300	He just kind of...
6037300	6038300	Try again.
6038300	6039300	And...
6039300	6040300	How long were your divorces?
6040300	6042300	Like how long did it take to officially...
6042300	6044300	Between one and the next or between...
6044300	6046300	No, each divorce, like how long?
6046300	6048300	My parents divorced for nine years.
6048300	6049300	Oh, pretty quick.
6049300	6051300	Pretty quick, about like six months.
6051300	6052300	Six months?
6052300	6053300	That's efficient.
6053300	6054300	I just want to recap.
6054300	6059300	The guy who's been married twice says, you just got to try again.
6059300	6062300	That's his secret.
6062300	6068300	It could be looked at as the secret to a happy marriage or the secret to perpetual divorce.
6068300	6072300	It could be that just trying again is the problem.
6072300	6073300	Yeah.
6073300	6074300	Yes.
6074300	6075300	I've been married...
6075300	6077300	I've been divorced seven times.
6077300	6078300	Yeah.
6078300	6079300	I don't know what it is.
6079300	6081300	And then Jeff says, you keep getting married.
6081300	6082300	Yeah.
6082300	6083300	Something like that.
6083300	6084300	I'm trying to quote my own show.
6084300	6085300	And I'm like...
6085300	6087300	I've turned to the Stan Lee.
6087300	6088300	I got to...
6088300	6089300	All right.
6089300	6090300	All right.
6090300	6092300	A couple more rows here.
6092300	6094300	I think this is working out really well.
6094300	6095300	I like...
6095300	6096300	I'm Grant.
6096300	6100300	I'm talking to my buddy that I grew up with, Casey Rep.
6100300	6101300	He's been told...
6101300	6102300	Oh, shit.
6102300	6103300	A friend of mine.
6103300	6104300	He worked with that guy.
6104300	6105300	He specifically told me not to name drop.
6106300	6108300	But we've been talking about how cool it is that Dustin's up on stage.
6108300	6111300	And so I want to apologize for name dropping him.
6111300	6113300	But also, good to see you, man.
6113300	6114300	That's nice.
6114300	6115300	Yeah.
6115300	6116300	Casey Rep's a friend of Starburn's family.
6116300	6117300	He works at Starburn's.
6117300	6118300	He's an amazing guy.
6118300	6121300	He's a Harman-town feral fanatic.
6121300	6122300	Can't Casey's brother.
6122300	6123300	Hey, Dan.
6123300	6125300	I just had my one-year anniversary at Starburn's.
6125300	6128300	Thank you so much for allotting me a job there.
6128300	6129300	No problem.
6129300	6130300	Hey, no problem.
6130300	6131300	It's my pleasure.
6131300	6133300	I like to give back to the community.
6133300	6137300	Not in any actual philanthropic way that would benefit sick people, but...
6137300	6140300	Mike, why is Casey not flown out here?
6140300	6142300	Well, because Casey's human garbage.
6142300	6143300	What are you talking about?
6143300	6145300	What do you mean why is Casey not flown out here?
6145300	6152300	Why is the doorman at Trump Tower not flown out for Donald Trump's birthday?
6152300	6156300	Because fucking Donald's got a birthday to focus on.
6156300	6157300	All right.
6157300	6158300	What's up?
6158300	6159300	I'm Nick.
6159300	6161300	I just wanted to give the dice guy an opportunity to rethink.
6161300	6167300	It seemed like Spencer's really good at spotting Tom.
6167300	6168300	What?
6168300	6175300	This guy used his access to the microphone to do a pretty good callback.
6175300	6178300	He just wants to warn you, Spencer, that...
6178300	6179300	Well, no.
6179300	6183300	He wants to warn the guy that gave you his dice, that if there is Tom on the dice...
6183300	6187300	Sorry to the teenager who's apparently traumatized by alltalk.com
6187300	6194300	and has somehow mysteriously worked his way into a cum conversation warehouse.
6194300	6195300	Yeah.
6195300	6196300	Well, we'll see.
6196300	6197300	We'll find out.
6197300	6198300	Spencer's going to open the dice and we'll see what's on him.
6198300	6199300	Hello.
6199300	6200300	Hello.
6200300	6201300	I'm Kelly.
6201300	6202300	Hi.
6202300	6203300	What's on your mind?
6203300	6206300	Just being here.
6206300	6210300	Did you have your hand up or am I, like, accosting you?
6210300	6211300	I had it up.
6211300	6212300	Oh, okay.
6212300	6213300	Yeah.
6213300	6214300	Is there anything like...
6214300	6215300	I don't know.
6215300	6219300	Is there anything in the frontal lobe that you want to cum out of your mouth?
6219300	6224300	Too soon to say the word cum.
6224300	6227300	Us ladies don't do that, you know.
6227300	6228300	We don't cum.
6228300	6229300	You don't cum.
6229300	6230300	Okay.
6230300	6231300	Yes.
6231300	6232300	Sure.
6232300	6233300	Okay.
6233300	6236300	Is there anything that you wanted to share?
6236300	6238300	Oh, gosh.
6238300	6239300	All right.
6239300	6241300	Just raising your hand just to...
6241300	6242300	Hey.
6242300	6244300	Dan, you missed two down here just so you know.
6244300	6245300	I'm coming back that way.
6245300	6246300	Hit that back row.
6246300	6247300	That's cool.
6247300	6248300	Okay.
6248300	6249300	I got one more.
6249300	6250300	I got a couple stragglers.
6250300	6251300	I don't understand.
6251300	6253300	She had her hand up and then...
6253300	6256300	I'll be confused about that for the next three years.
6256300	6257300	Hello.
6257300	6258300	Hello.
6258300	6259300	I'm Adam.
6259300	6260300	What's going on?
6260300	6262300	I'm just sitting here, you know.
6262300	6264300	Another one of these.
6264300	6269300	I got my arms really tired but not because I was jacking off like the teenager over there.
6269300	6270300	What?
6270300	6271300	In the world...
6271300	6275300	That's why a lot of times we're tired.
6275300	6276300	Okay.
6276300	6278300	So, the preamble is your arms tired.
6278300	6279300	Okay.
6279300	6280300	Now the microphone's in your face.
6280300	6281300	That's a new condition.
6281300	6283300	How are you going to deal with that?
6283300	6284300	Oh, I don't know.
6284300	6291300	See, what happened was I had something planned and then I forgot what it was while I was waiting.
6291300	6293300	Nice.
6293300	6298300	McGathey, you're all right.
6298300	6300300	The sound bites are...
6300300	6302300	I'm back on board.
6302300	6303300	All right.
6303300	6304300	Okay.
6304300	6305300	All right.
6305300	6306300	All right.
6306300	6307300	I'm coming back down.
6307300	6308300	We got a couple stragglers.
6308300	6309300	It was nice.
6309300	6310300	I like that.
6310300	6311300	I was able to ease my social anxiety.
6311300	6315300	I also like that the way this cinema is designed, you actually have...
6315300	6317300	I can be like Donahue.
6317300	6319300	Donahue was a talk show host.
6319300	6323300	This is the dream of Parmesan.
6323300	6325300	What's happening with you?
6325300	6326300	Hi.
6327300	6330300	First of all, I don't remember what I was going to ask.
6330300	6333300	He was going to ask something and he said he has a joke in Paris.
6333300	6335300	Please speak in the microphone.
6335300	6337300	I'm forgetting everything.
6337300	6338300	All right.
6338300	6339300	Okay.
6339300	6341300	All right.
6341300	6344300	She's shriveling up into her friend's armpit.
6344300	6346300	What's on your mind?
6346300	6352300	I had two friends who really wanted to be here tonight, but unlike teenagers, they couldn't come.
6353300	6355300	He had a bit.
6355300	6356300	All right.
6356300	6357300	Okay.
6357300	6359300	He's been waiting 20 minutes for that.
6359300	6363300	You know what I think might have happened there is that they're like, everyone raise your hand.
6363300	6364300	We'll cast a wide net.
6364300	6370300	Well, you told people to keep their hands up, but you didn't say why and then you just started doing stuff to them.
6370300	6378300	Don't you think it's implied that if you have your hand up, the microphone is going to be in your face and you're going to be accountable to the public?
6378300	6380300	After the 14th person.
6380300	6381300	Yeah.
6381300	6387300	Don't you think of the 16th person is like, hey, how do you tell a three legged pollock from an octopus?
6387300	6389300	And everyone's like how?
6389300	6390300	And they're like, I forgot.
6390300	6392300	Don't you think they deserve to be booed?
6392300	6393300	Maybe.
6393300	6394300	No, not booed.
6394300	6395300	No, not booed.
6395300	6396300	Nobody should be bully.
6396300	6397300	But what are you going to do?
6397300	6398300	Hello.
6398300	6399300	Hello.
6399300	6401300	Can you reveal anything about the next Rixie Minutes episode?
6401300	6403300	The next Rixie Minutes episode.
6403300	6410300	Rixie Minutes episode being the format of the episode is that Justin goes in the VO booth and makes up crazy shit.
6410300	6414300	And then we animate things to try to make sense around it.
6414300	6417300	What can I reveal about the next one?
6417300	6418300	Not much.
6418300	6420300	They're watching TV again.
6420300	6424300	So there's I can't really reveal anything about it.
6424300	6428300	So let's let's enter the best part of the show.
6428300	6434300	Let's place in Dungeons and Dragons.
6434300	6436300	Now there's so we sit.
6436300	6438300	So we were sorry, sweetie.
6438300	6439300	What?
6439300	6440300	Nothing.
6440300	6441300	I was going to do the same thing you're going to do.
6441300	6445300	We were in San Francisco and then we were in Austin and those podcasts haven't even aired yet.
6445300	6454300	So even though on one hand, you guys have to actually listen to the narration, which Spencer always luxuriously provides.
6454300	6461300	The good news is, as you probably know, we move about five feet per podcast episode.
6461300	6463300	So there's not that much catching up to do.
6463300	6469300	But yeah, just in case you're you're basing it on the last podcast episode you listened to, we've done two since.
6469300	6470300	All right. That's all.
6470300	6472300	That's what you're going to say, right?
6472300	6474300	Dustin, why don't you play Quark?
6474300	6475300	Well, I have the sheets.
6475300	6478300	Just just pass them out top to bottom style.
6478300	6481300	OK, cool. I think that I'd like to play dignity.
6481300	6482300	Yeah, my character.
6482300	6483300	Yeah.
6483300	6485300	I'd love you to play dignity.
6485300	6486300	Thank you.
6486300	6487300	I forgot.
6487300	6488300	What's your name, sir?
6488300	6490300	Nick Nick Nick Nick is playing Christopher.
6490300	6491300	There you go.
6492300	6493300	And Aaron, do you have music?
6493300	6494300	I do.
6494300	6495300	I do have music.
6495300	6496300	Cool.
6496300	6497300	Thank you.
6497300	6498300	There you go.
6498300	6499300	Quark and dignity.
6499300	6500300	My betrothed.
6501300	6502300	Oh, shit.
6503300	6504300	All right.
6506300	6511300	When we last met, our heroes had found themselves in a mausoleum.
6511300	6520300	Striking out from Rosebook, the party was on the road to Fornheim, the frozen city, to confront Admiral Darkstar once again.
6520300	6527300	Burning with passion but devoid of directionality, our gang ran into a child known as Lil Baskins,
6527300	6533300	a scrappy and industrious chap who offered to guide the party through the wilderness and lead them to Fornheim.
6533300	6538300	Quark traded his greatsword for the boy's stick, which turned out to be a magical weapon.
6538300	6543300	Lil Baskins warned of highwaymen and took a detour through a graveyard.
6543300	6549300	Their dignity tried to get to know the boy, who was suspiciously uncomfortable with discussing his life,
6549300	6553300	leading the gang to suspect he may be a ghost.
6553300	6560300	Confronting the boy, he revealed his ghastly past, and after an emotional bonding experience, decided to trust the little ghost,
6560300	6563300	even as he led them into a dank crypt.
6563300	6565300	But where were they going?
6565300	6568300	Was Lil Baskins really trustworthy?
6568300	6573300	And how would going into an underground mausoleum get them into the Northern Highlands?
6573300	6576300	Find out next on An All-New Harmon Town.
6579300	6591300	I mean, one of the most frustrating things about doing this three-city tour without it being podcasts,
6591300	6594300	is I really want to tweet about how much I love Lil Baskins.
6594300	6599300	Such a great, fun character's name to say.
6599300	6600300	Lil Baskins?
6600300	6601300	It's great, right?
6601300	6607300	Yeah, so it's like this little newsy kid that we met in a town, and it turned out he's a ghost, right?
6607300	6609300	But you guys were pretty cool with him.
6609300	6610300	Yeah.
6610300	6611300	He's a ghost, yeah.
6611300	6612300	He's going to guide us.
6612300	6615300	Yeah, and so now we're going into a mausoleum.
6615300	6617300	Yeah, okay.
6617300	6618300	That's what's happening.
6618300	6619300	You already explained it.
6619300	6621300	You're in an overstocked graveyard.
6621300	6625300	You see gray tombstones stabbing out of the sickly green grass.
6625300	6626300	Oh, shit.
6626300	6627300	Let me give you that guy's dice.
6627300	6628300	Sorry.
6628300	6629300	I'll need that.
6629300	6630300	Sorry.
6630300	6631300	Look for cum.
6631300	6636300	As well as you see the sun burning through the misty gray cloud cover.
6636300	6641300	A large mausoleum stands sentry over the legions of gravestones in the yard.
6641300	6644300	Its heavy stone doors completely ajar.
6644300	6648300	Cold darkness lies inside.
6648300	6653300	Lil Baskins, is this a shortcut you take to the great beyond?
6653300	6658300	Yeah, we have to go through here so we avoid all those highway men that I warned us about earlier.
6658300	6660300	We trust you, Lil Baskins.
6660300	6662300	Thanks, man.
6662300	6665300	Lil Baskins, when you were alive, did you cum a lot?
6665300	6667300	No, I was...
6667300	6669300	Wait, what does that mean?
6669300	6670300	Oh, sorry.
6670300	6673300	What age is Lil Baskins, like permanently?
6673300	6675300	He looks about 12.
6675300	6676300	Okay.
6676300	6681300	Sharpie, as a paladin, I'm going to ask you to keep your distance from Lil Baskins.
6681300	6683300	No, I shouldn't be talking to him about this.
6683300	6684300	No, we don't need to discuss it.
6684300	6686300	We can talk about it later.
6686300	6689300	I think you should just keep your distance.
6689300	6692300	I'll just go behind the door.
6692300	6695300	No.
6695300	6698300	All right, so we're walking through the...
6698300	6701300	I mean, you were outside of a mausoleum.
6701300	6702300	All right.
6702300	6704300	I follow Lil Baskins.
6704300	6705300	I follow as well.
6705300	6707300	All right.
6707300	6708300	What about the rest of you?
6708300	6709300	Yeah, I'm going to follow.
6709300	6710300	Just making sure.
6710300	6711300	Dustin?
6711300	6713300	I'm going to just for safety.
6713300	6715300	Everybody's walking through the door?
6715300	6716300	Yeah.
6716300	6718300	I'm going to stand outside the door and just kind of keep watch,
6718300	6720300	but I'm not going to enter the room.
6720300	6721300	Nice.
6721300	6722300	Cool.
6722300	6723300	Yeah, you don't have to coast if you don't want to.
6723300	6724300	Thank you.
6724300	6726300	I'm going to draw my sword.
6726300	6729300	I'm just going to have my sword out as we're walking through the...
6729300	6732300	Is that what a neutral milk hotel would do?
6732300	6734300	Is that why you do it?
6734300	6735300	Razzed.
6735300	6736300	Razzed.
6736300	6738300	Begin razzed.
6738300	6741300	All right, so you enter the mausoleum.
6741300	6744300	Inside you see amid the darkness several statuettes,
6744300	6749300	each about a foot high bordering an ornate brick pathway that leads
6749300	6753300	to a large five foot sculpture of a robed female holding a wide,
6753300	6756300	shallow dish as if an offering.
6756300	6758300	Worst mausoleum ever.
6758300	6761300	There's supposed to just be little rooms with dead people.
6761300	6765300	I inspect the statue and see if I can read anything.
6765300	6769300	There's no inscription, but the woman looks to be maybe 20 years old.
6769300	6770300	And she's a statue?
6770300	6771300	Yes.
6771300	6772300	Sorry.
6772300	6776300	I look inside the gold dish that she's holding.
6776300	6778300	There's nothing.
6778300	6779300	Also, it's not gold.
6779300	6781300	I don't know where you got that.
6781300	6782300	I thought I heard you.
6782300	6783300	I don't know.
6783300	6784300	I don't remember something.
6784300	6785300	Okay.
6785300	6790300	Lil Baskins, who is this woman with this empty, non-gold bowl?
6790300	6791300	I don't know.
6791300	6795300	There's no inscriptions anywhere on this mausoleum.
6795300	6799300	Well, Baskins, do you just pass through the mausoleum
6799300	6801300	or you don't know what it's for?
6801300	6803300	Well, I mean, we're using it as a passageway.
6803300	6807300	That's more important than who is buried here to me right now.
6807300	6808300	So usually you just keep walking.
6808300	6810300	You don't usually stop and look at this shit?
6810300	6811300	Well, I did.
6811300	6813300	But like I said, there's no inscriptions anywhere.
6813300	6814300	You can't really learn anything.
6814300	6815300	There's just pictures.
6815300	6816300	I don't know.
6816300	6818300	But I'm saying the fact that we're stopped here right now,
6818300	6821300	instead of just continuing moving, it's only because we have curiosities.
6821300	6823300	It's not because you want it to stop.
6823300	6824300	Oh, well, no.
6824300	6828300	We got to close all the doors before we can proceed.
6828300	6829300	Which doors?
6829300	6831300	The doors to the outside of the mausoleum.
6831300	6834300	Oh, our hipster friend is still waiting outside.
6834300	6837300	I stroll in.
6837300	6838300	Really cool.
6838300	6844300	And then I lean against the wall and I light a cigarette.
6844300	6846300	Yeah, Clark loves cigarettes.
6846300	6847300	She knows.
6847300	6848300	Or he.
6848300	6849300	Okay.
6849300	6852300	So just clarification, I'm looking at these gained items.
6852300	6853300	Yeah.
6853300	6855300	Robot baby plus power unit.
6855300	6856300	Yeah.
6856300	6858300	The power unit is inside the baby.
6858300	6859300	It's powering him.
6859300	6860300	Okay.
6860300	6863300	So it's like, you know, life force, I guess.
6863300	6864300	Yeah.
6864300	6865300	Like it's batteries.
6865300	6866300	Okay.
6866300	6867300	Like it's power unit.
6867300	6870300	And the gold dish is to sort of put it there.
6870300	6871300	It sure is.
6871300	6872300	It's not gold, though.
6872300	6873300	It's.
6873300	6874300	Well, I'm going off.
6874300	6875300	I know.
6875300	6876300	I know.
6876300	6877300	I somehow.
6877300	6878300	Don't worry about it.
6878300	6880300	I somehow projected goldness onto this dish.
6880300	6882300	Well, maybe it should have been gold.
6883300	6886300	But I am looking at the woman has in this.
6886300	6890300	It's a statue of a woman and she's holding this ball.
6890300	6891300	I just, I'm curious.
6891300	6898300	I'm looking with my, I know I'm only a wizard, but I'm kind of looking just with a layman's
6898300	6904300	eye at the statue, particularly the relationship of the dish to the woman's hands.
6904300	6909300	Like I'm, you know, I'm obviously like looking at this, like wondering is, is this a situation
6909300	6912300	where you put something in the dish and something happens?
6912300	6915300	There doesn't seem to be any kind of joints or seams.
6915300	6920300	So unless it might be magical, you know, but unless it's magical, it doesn't seem like
6920300	6921300	it moves.
6921300	6923300	How many carrots is the dish?
6923300	6931300	Oh, I was, I was thinking carrot was like a unit measurement of length or something.
6931300	6933300	It was a gold.
6933300	6935300	Can I go against the wall?
6935300	6941300	I'm kind of like sneaking around the room examining for any items or or inscriptions
6941300	6943300	or anything at all that would have a clue.
6943300	6945300	There's no inscriptions.
6945300	6946300	I said that.
6946300	6948300	But you do find a small key.
6948300	6951300	It's rusted and made of iron.
6951300	6953300	Put that shit in the bowl.
6955300	6958300	Drop it in the bowl.
6958300	6959300	All right.
6959300	6962300	I pick it up and I drop in the bowl and I walk away and I lean against the wall and I
6962300	6963300	smoke a cigarette.
6963300	6966300	That sounds like a t-shirt they would sell at Spencer's gifts.
6966300	6969300	Put that shit in the bowl.
6970300	6971300	All right.
6971300	6976300	You do those things and you're smoking, but nothing seems to be happening.
6976300	6980300	Little Baskins is like we need to close the doors to proceed.
6980300	6983300	Gentlemen, I am closing the doors.
6983300	6989300	But be careful because once the doors are closed, we'll be in pitch darkness and you
6989300	6991300	can't light any lights.
6991300	6992300	Why is that, Little Baskins?
6992300	6995300	Because the ghost way doesn't appreciate that sort of thing.
6995300	6997300	The ghost way?
6997300	6998300	Yes.
6998300	7002300	Way, W-A-Y or W-H-E-Y.
7002300	7005300	The ghost way, protein?
7006300	7007300	Sorry.
7007300	7008300	Is that like a path?
7008300	7010300	The ghost porridge hates this.
7010300	7012300	Is that like a pass or like a code?
7012300	7015300	You don't have to go the ghost way?
7015300	7019300	It's more of like a path.
7019300	7020300	Okay.
7020300	7021300	The ghosts take occasionally.
7021300	7023300	I mean, it's a physical path.
7023300	7026300	You know, can I try sense motive on Little Baskins?
7026300	7027300	Yeah.
7028300	7033300	He seems to be caring for your well-being, is his motive.
7033300	7035300	He seems like a cool kid.
7035300	7036300	All right.
7036300	7041300	Well, I respect your culture and the culture of the undead.
7041300	7044300	So, gentlemen, let's keep our torches unlit.
7044300	7047300	And anything else you have that lights up, let's not light it.
7047300	7048300	Light it.
7048300	7050300	I'm going to close these doors.
7050300	7051300	How many doors are there?
7051300	7052300	There's just the two.
7052300	7053300	Okay.
7053300	7054300	All right.
7054300	7059300	Because I can't get past the significance of this bowl,
7059300	7064300	I'm just going to sit in it while the door is closed.
7064300	7067300	You feel a rusty key under your butt.
7070300	7073300	If Dan had a dollar.
7075300	7076300	Oh, I'm sorry.
7076300	7077300	Trap sense.
7077300	7079300	Are you going to do some street art?
7079300	7081300	I have trap sense plus two.
7081300	7086300	I just want to detect any traps in the doors or the bowl with the key in it.
7086300	7089300	You look around for traps, but you don't find anything.
7089300	7090300	Okay.
7090300	7091300	We're clear, guys.
7091300	7093300	Have you tried parkour?
7096300	7097300	Have you seen my shoes?
7097300	7099300	Of course I have.
7099300	7100300	All right.
7100300	7104300	You want someone to gram you while the lights go out?
7104300	7105300	No.
7105300	7106300	I'm sorry.
7106300	7111300	What hashtag do you want to use for the lights going out?
7111300	7113300	Lights off gram.
7113300	7114300	Okay.
7114300	7115300	Hashtag thanks Obama.
7115300	7117300	Thanks Obama.
7117300	7120300	So you're sitting in the bowl still?
7120300	7122300	Yeah, I am sitting in the bowl.
7122300	7123300	Cool.
7123300	7128300	Dignity closes the doors and after they close.
7128300	7130300	Flap, flap, flap.
7130300	7132300	Why are you quacking?
7132300	7133300	What?
7133300	7134300	No, that was the doors closing.
7134300	7135300	Flap, flap.
7135300	7136300	Too close.
7136300	7137300	Two doors.
7137300	7139300	Figured out what the bowl is.
7139300	7140300	Oh, no.
7140300	7141300	Oh, God.
7141300	7142300	I didn't.
7142300	7143300	Okay.
7143300	7146300	You got to eat that mic though if you're going to have like passing thoughts.
7146300	7147300	Eat it.
7147300	7148300	Yeah.
7148300	7149300	Closer.
7149300	7150300	Like this.
7150300	7151300	Closer?
7151300	7152300	Yeah, yeah.
7152300	7153300	Like that.
7153300	7154300	Don't be afraid to almost kiss it.
7154300	7155300	Oh.
7155300	7156300	Yeah.
7156300	7157300	You love that mic.
7157300	7158300	I mean not.
7158300	7159300	Yeah.
7159300	7160300	Whatever.
7160300	7161300	You're great.
7161300	7162300	You're doing great.
7163300	7168300	No, I was thinking like once the doors close maybe it lights up or something.
7168300	7169300	Maybe.
7169300	7170300	Maybe.
7170300	7171300	You wish.
7171300	7172300	Yeah.
7172300	7174300	Once the doors close, we're in pitch black.
7174300	7178300	If the lights came on, why would that even be a thing as a dungeon master that you would
7178300	7179300	write?
7179300	7181300	Of course that's not going to happen.
7181300	7182300	That's just convenience.
7182300	7184300	The doors close and a light comes on.
7184300	7185300	Oh, good.
7185300	7186300	I read a book.
7186300	7189300	You've made a book.
7189300	7193540	Can you describe a scenario where you can't eat an ice cream cone that you're holding
7193540	7194780	in your hand?
7194780	7196300	But you still need to keep it close to you.
7196300	7198020	Yeah, but you have to keep it close to your face.
7198020	7199180	No, you want to keep it close.
7199180	7200180	I'm using him.
7200180	7203580	I'm saying to him like, like, don't be afraid of the mic.
7203580	7204580	Yeah.
7204580	7206580	I just want to think of it like an ice cream cone.
7206580	7207580	Of course you can't eat it.
7207580	7209460	I don't want him to lick it the whole time.
7209460	7210460	No one wants to do that.
7210460	7214020	I'm just saying like hold it as close as you would if it was made of ice cream.
7214020	7216220	That way you'll always have it close enough.
7216220	7217220	Okay.
7217220	7218700	Because he's a very witty.
7218700	7219700	He's saying a lot of funny things.
7219700	7220700	Sometimes the mic is away from it.
7220700	7222700	Are we in the game right now?
7222700	7223700	Sorry?
7223700	7224700	Are we in the game?
7224700	7225700	We're still in the game.
7225700	7226700	All right.
7226700	7228340	So the doors have closed.
7228340	7232220	Dan's sitting on a key inside a bowl.
7232220	7235420	You hear the grinding stone of something moving.
7235420	7242780	Dan, you feel under your butt movement as you feel yourself slide perhaps laterally to the
7242780	7246180	left or some other direction.
7246180	7248180	Nice.
7249180	7251180	Does my low light vision work in this scenario?
7251180	7252180	No.
7252180	7253180	Does anyone have dark vision?
7253180	7254180	I light a torch.
7254180	7255180	No.
7255180	7256180	God damn it.
7256180	7257180	Are you serious?
7257180	7258180	What?
7258180	7259180	Why?
7259180	7260180	What happened?
7260180	7261180	Because the ghost weight doesn't make it.
7261180	7262180	You're disrespecting their culture.
7262180	7263180	The ghost way?
7263180	7264180	W-H-E-Y?
7264180	7265180	Are you fucking kidding me?
7265180	7267180	Yeah, the ghost pudding.
7267180	7268180	No.
7268180	7269180	Come on.
7269180	7270180	We trusted the kid that we have to go.
7270180	7271180	Okay.
7271180	7277180	I hold it up and then I put it out and I lean against the wall with my Lego.
7277180	7278180	Okay.
7278180	7279180	So you light the torch.
7279180	7280180	No, he never did.
7280180	7281180	No.
7281180	7282180	No, I never did.
7282180	7283180	I go to do it.
7283180	7284180	Oh, you took it out and...
7284180	7285180	They give me a look and then I...
7285180	7286180	I mean, is that cheating?
7286180	7288180	Because he said that he lit the torch.
7288180	7289180	No.
7289180	7290180	Well, I just thought he...
7290180	7293180	I thought his second thing was after lighting the torch, I put it out.
7293180	7294180	He didn't do anything.
7294180	7295180	All right.
7295180	7296180	If you say so.
7296180	7297180	He's not even...
7297180	7298180	You're doing great, Dusty.
7298180	7299180	He's choosing a filter for this.
7299180	7300180	Everybody clap for Dustin.
7300180	7301180	That's sad.
7301180	7306180	Don't encourage him.
7306180	7307180	I'm depressed.
7307180	7308180	That's sad.
7308180	7309180	It's good.
7309180	7310180	It's good applause.
7310180	7311180	Oh, okay.
7311180	7312180	Thank you.
7312180	7313180	All right.
7313180	7314180	So Sharpie is moving to the left.
7314180	7316180	We hear a grinding noise.
7316180	7317180	Yep.
7317180	7318180	I call out.
7318180	7321180	I'm sitting in the bowl and I'm moving to the left.
7321180	7322180	Yeah.
7322180	7323180	That's the doorway.
7323180	7324180	It's opening up.
7324180	7325180	All right.
7325180	7331180	I move towards where I know the statue is and I grab onto Sharpie's foot.
7331180	7332180	All right.
7332180	7333180	You do that.
7333180	7334180	Something's touching my foot.
7334180	7335180	It's me.
7335180	7336180	Okay.
7336180	7340820	So we're just going to want to go down these stairs here if you want to get off of that
7340820	7342700	statue.
7342700	7343700	Can we see them?
7343700	7344700	No.
7344700	7345700	You can't see anything.
7345700	7346700	You're in pitch darkness.
7346700	7347700	Do we have to hold each other?
7347700	7351660	Well, you might want to figure that out, yeah, because otherwise, who knows what'll happen.
7351660	7352660	All right.
7352660	7356100	I take out my rope.
7356100	7359660	I tie it around my waist and I pass it to Sharpie.
7359660	7360660	All right.
7360660	7363180	Let's pass this through the group.
7363180	7366820	Well, Baskins, are you corporeal?
7366820	7367820	Not very.
7367820	7369380	I mean, I can't occasionally, but no.
7369380	7371060	I do have low light vision.
7371060	7374180	Yeah, but it's too dark for low light.
7374180	7375180	God damn it.
7375180	7376180	No light.
7376180	7377180	Wait.
7377180	7378180	What?
7378180	7379180	You made that sound again?
7379180	7380180	What?
7380180	7381180	You made the sound again.
7381180	7382180	It was an accident.
7382180	7383180	It's a computer noise.
7383180	7384180	A chastise you.
7384180	7385180	Chastise.
7385180	7386180	All right.
7386180	7387180	So are we down?
7387180	7390900	Christoperg, how are you feeling?
7390900	7392900	I'm trying to figure out how to get through.
7392900	7396780	I think the cloak thing would be a good idea, but climbing downstairs with the person in
7396780	7399060	front falls.
7399060	7400060	Everybody falls.
7400060	7401060	Right.
7401060	7402060	So.
7402060	7403860	I think you just described Bitcoin.
7403860	7404860	Yeah.
7404860	7408700	Or one of the problems of Bitcoin.
7408700	7409700	One of many.
7409700	7410700	I'm kidding.
7410700	7411700	I just.
7411700	7412700	Or one of the other ones.
7412700	7415260	I don't know why I didn't say I'm kidding.
7415260	7418580	Dan Harmon collapses Bitcoin with a joke.
7419580	7420580	Well, yeah.
7420580	7421660	Little Baskins.
7421660	7426580	I think what we're going to have to have you do because you're an audio only presence.
7426580	7430020	You're going to have to keep going.
7430020	7431020	Little Baskins.
7431020	7435220	You're going to have to keep saying something so we can follow you.
7435220	7436220	Yeah.
7436220	7437220	Okay.
7437220	7438220	How about.
7438220	7440380	That's what I was going to say.
7440380	7441380	Say Marco.
7441380	7443820	Thanks for making it sound like I wasn't thinking it up myself.
7443820	7446060	I appreciate that.
7446060	7449500	I thought it was really clever if I would have just came up with Marco on the spot.
7449500	7450500	I'm sorry.
7450500	7451500	Jesus.
7451500	7452500	Follow me.
7452500	7453500	What?
7453500	7454500	Follow me.
7454500	7455500	Nah, Marco.
7455500	7456500	Well.
7456500	7457500	What?
7457500	7458500	Little Baskins.
7458500	7459500	These are these.
7459500	7461980	Are these not standard stairs?
7461980	7469980	They're just stairs, but I feel confident that I can walk down the stairs in total darkness.
7469980	7470980	Yeah.
7470980	7472980	I am.
7472980	7475740	I walk pretty well.
7475740	7476740	I think.
7476740	7477740	All right.
7477740	7478740	Well.
7478740	7479740	Just charge ahead then.
7479740	7480740	All right.
7480740	7481740	You walk down the stairs successfully.
7481740	7482740	Bam.
7482740	7483740	Wow.
7483740	7487100	And what do the rest of you guys do?
7487100	7490660	Well, in a meta sense, I'm getting a drink.
7490660	7496740	I'll creep down behind her like crouching, but I'm pretty scared of the dark.
7496740	7497740	Yeah, you are.
7497740	7498740	That happens.
7498740	7499740	You're downstairs, too.
7499740	7500980	Are you guys tied together or not?
7500980	7501980	I don't think so.
7501980	7502980	I want to do the rope thing.
7502980	7504700	I think the rope thing is a good idea.
7504700	7506700	Who was doing the rope thing?
7506700	7507700	I was.
7507700	7508700	Okay.
7508700	7510140	Well, then I guess that means I followed you down the stairs.
7510140	7511140	All right.
7511140	7513500	I grabbed hold of the rope in the middle part.
7513500	7514500	Yeah.
7514500	7515780	I'm going to grab the end.
7515780	7516780	Okay.
7516780	7517780	You're down the stairs.
7517780	7521900	I have the key still clenched in my buttocks.
7521900	7523580	That will come up.
7523580	7528620	So Little Baskins is down there and he's like, hey, just follow the sound of my voice.
7528620	7534360	Oh, also just be aware that this path that we're on is only about 10 feet wide and there's
7534360	7537360	no railings and I think it's bottomless.
7537360	7538360	What you think?
7538360	7539360	Yeah.
7539360	7540360	I thought you you've been down this way before.
7540360	7541360	Yeah.
7541360	7542720	But I usually don't fall off.
7542720	7544360	What at what point is it bottomless?
7544360	7548680	There's an end of the stairs and it's a bottomless or it's an endless stairwell.
7548680	7552680	No, it goes to it goes to a regular path.
7552680	7557360	Does Little Baskins have any any temperature like do I when you're close to him?
7557360	7559440	Do you feel cold or anything?
7559440	7562360	Does he smell like spirits?
7562360	7563760	Not as far as you know.
7563760	7568200	Something that everyone has said for the last five minutes is what she said.
7568200	7571720	I just wanted to point that out.
7571720	7573240	All right.
7573240	7574240	Marco.
7574240	7575240	Polo.
7575240	7576240	Polo.
7576240	7577240	Polo.
7577240	7578240	Marco.
7578240	7579240	Polo.
7579240	7580240	Polo.
7580240	7582080	How do we know this everyone?
7582080	7588280	You feel the ground shift under your feet and give way.
7588280	7589280	Ground shifting.
7589280	7596040	Dignity and Krista Berg failed to dive out of the way, although Quark and Sharpie managed
7596040	7599400	to avoid avoid their fate.
7599400	7609880	You guys fall 30 feet down and hit the ground.
7609880	7611960	Taking 13 damage apiece.
7611960	7615640	Oh, are you guys okay?
7615640	7616960	Were we still tied together?
7617640	7619160	What I heard was that you're holding on.
7619160	7620160	I was holding on.
7620160	7621440	I have rope burns in my hand.
7621440	7622440	Yeah.
7622440	7626080	But are you guys okay?
7626080	7627080	I'm not sure.
7627080	7628080	Let me check my hit points.
7628080	7629080	Yeah, I'm okay.
7629080	7630280	I'm all right.
7630280	7631960	I think we found the bottom.
7631960	7634000	Are you are you sorry?
7634000	7635000	Are you safe up there?
7635000	7636000	What?
7636000	7637680	What do you what do you see?
7637680	7638680	We don't see anything.
7638680	7640240	It's pitch dark.
7640240	7645920	But we heard a very modern critical error of some kind.
7645920	7654560	It was a small passing of gas, kind of what that sounds like.
7654560	7659480	Are you guys coming?
7659480	7660480	Not sure.
7660480	7662520	A little bastion.
7662520	7663520	Where did our friends go?
7663520	7664520	Can you go down?
7664520	7666520	Wait, what's it called?
7666520	7667520	Baskins.
7667520	7674080	Why don't you do what you wish?
7674080	7678040	Little Baskins, can you go down there and investigate for us?
7678040	7679040	They fell down a pit.
7679040	7680040	I mean, I can see.
7680040	7681040	Fine.
7681040	7682040	Yeah.
7682040	7683040	What do you see down there?
7683040	7684040	Oh, they didn't fall off that pit.
7684040	7685400	This is a, this is a different pit.
7685400	7687360	This is a much better pit to fall down.
7687360	7688360	So it's not bottomless.
7688360	7691000	It's like, no, this one definitely about 30 feet deep.
7691000	7692000	It looks like.
7692000	7693000	Okay.
7693000	7694480	Well, is the rope still down there?
7694480	7696080	Can we just pull them up?
7696320	7697320	Yeah.
7697320	7701360	They're tied to a rope or, or, or, uh, you operate in the assumption that they're just
7701360	7702360	holding the rope.
7702360	7703360	Right.
7703360	7704360	I tied it around the rope.
7704360	7705960	You have the rope down there.
7705960	7706960	Yeah.
7706960	7707960	Okay.
7707960	7709800	We're going to pull up the rope.
7709800	7714720	I have a 12 strength, so it should be no problem.
7714720	7716160	But what's down in the hole?
7716160	7718600	Like, do we want to proceed down?
7718600	7719600	What's down in the hole?
7719600	7723200	You guys, I, uh, I, I feel around.
7723200	7727640	You feel small, uh, smooth walls and nothing else.
7727640	7734680	Was this pit what lay ahead of us as if the path that we were on suddenly had a pit in
7734680	7736960	it and we just didn't fall in and they did.
7736960	7740840	No, it was a pit trap at wherein the floor gives way and becomes a pit.
7740840	7741840	All right.
7741840	7747640	Let's get the, get the out of there and pull me out of the golden hole made of gold.
7747640	7748640	You do that.
7748640	7749640	You're pulled out.
7749640	7750680	We're pulling you up.
7751680	7753680	You're successfully pulled out.
7755240	7758360	So she said, Oh, little baskins.
7758360	7760240	Like, I forgot there's traps around here.
7760240	7761560	I don't set them off.
7761560	7762560	Okay.
7762560	7763560	You're doing great.
7763560	7768920	You're, um, a ghost baby that can see, you're leaving for people that can't see.
7768920	7769920	Yeah.
7769920	7773000	And you're being very flippant and vague about everything.
7773000	7774920	Um, I said, I forgot.
7774920	7777160	I mean, when you're a ghost, you don't set off traps.
7777160	7779880	If I have a trap sense, can I do it in the dark?
7779880	7781360	You can try, but it'll be worse.
7781360	7784600	So we've moved past the hole in the floor, right?
7784600	7786320	No, you're on the one side of the hole.
7786320	7787320	Okay.
7787320	7789600	So we need to get across this, but it's in pitch dark.
7789600	7795360	So can we throw, we tie the rope to something and throw it across and then just, I guess,
7795360	7796360	climb across.
7796360	7798480	You could do all sorts of things.
7798480	7799480	Little baskets.
7799480	7800480	Can you float?
7800480	7801480	Yeah.
7801480	7802480	Can you carry a rope?
7802480	7803480	No.
7803480	7808720	Uh, we need to, yeah, well, little baskets.
7808720	7814800	Can you describe, we want you to understand that as non-ghost babies, we cannot see anything.
7814800	7815800	I know.
7815800	7818940	So we need to anchor this rope so we can get across.
7818940	7823160	Can you tell us, be our eyes for us, tell us, are there structures over there to which
7823160	7827840	we can anchor this rope if we could hit it with a, with a grapple or something?
7827840	7831200	There aren't, uh, it's only eight feet wide.
7831200	7832520	You could probably jump it.
7832520	7833520	All right.
7833520	7837400	I, I, uh, I still have the rope tied to my waist.
7837400	7846280	I, uh, I rev up, I run towards the hole and I try to jump over the hole.
7846280	7848040	You fall in the hole.
7848040	7852340	You start, you start to go down and you guys notice the rope, it's, you know, doing that
7852340	7854440	thing that rope does when someone's fallen down something.
7854440	7856120	Yeah, it goes tout and starts pulling us.
7856120	7858960	I, I, yeah, I pull it and we, all right.
7858960	7859960	You pull her to safety.
7859960	7860960	Okay.
7860960	7861960	All right.
7861960	7862960	Let's, okay.
7863960	7866120	I've been looking at this sheet.
7866120	7867760	Would goggles at night work?
7867760	7868760	Yeah.
7868760	7869760	All right.
7869760	7872760	Thank you everybody for coming to Harman Town.
7872760	7873760	Yes.
