81000	84000	Saw your mama last night and said fuck it.
84000	86000	Alright, boring.
86000	87000	Thank you.
89000	91000	Have you given up on freestyle Dan?
91000	93000	Or have you just lost your...
93000	96000	I was just, you know, just happy.
96000	99000	I think a lot of rapping has to do with, you know,
99000	101000	you've got something you need to say.
101000	104000	I thought you were getting to a pretty good zone there.
104000	107000	Yeah, yeah, it was great.
107000	108000	I mean, you could hear the reaction.
108000	110000	They were overwhelmed.
110000	113000	In general, it's a great podcast.
113000	115000	There's a lot left to say.
117000	120000	I could launch now and do one of many segments
120000	122000	that would be totally relatable to the people,
122000	124000	that people are just waiting to gobble up.
124000	126000	I'm having some...
126000	129000	I just saw some of the decorator's proposals.
129000	131000	And, you know, I was a little disappointed to learn
131000	133000	that they were photos of just concepts
133000	136000	and not my actual house.
136000	137000	You know, stuff like that.
137000	138000	Stuff that you guys want to hear.
138000	139000	Because it's 2019.
139000	143000	Because right now you have a 17-bedroom, like...
143000	144000	Yeah.
144000	146000	Marques' mansion going on.
146000	150000	And you have a one-air mattress and there's no chairs.
150000	153000	I'm truly the voice of the next generation.
153000	158000	From my blanche whiteness to my six-figure,
158000	161000	a weak income to my...
161000	164000	He makes $700,000 a week just for doing nothing.
164000	167000	To my complaints about my numerous gardeners,
167000	174000	to my two houses, to my eight years in podcasting.
174000	176000	I mean, I just... The list goes on and on.
176000	180000	I found it a little bit excessive that you have 17 lipizone
180000	182000	or horses in your house now.
182000	184000	Look, you get into a zone where you're like,
184000	186000	you're trying to chase that happy rabbit
186000	189000	and you can't catch it anymore, you know?
189000	192000	Lipizone is a very, you know, cost prohibitive.
192000	195000	Is it at all possible that anyone else here
195000	200000	has something to complain about?
200000	203000	Who here in the crowd thinks they have the most, like, righteous...
203000	206000	I mean, like, righteous indignation complaint right now?
206000	207000	Something...
207000	209000	Oh, there's a hand one up over here in the corner.
209000	210000	What was that?
210000	211000	The sun.
211000	212000	Ooh.
212000	213000	Oh, are you...
213000	214000	Oh.
214000	215000	Are you albino by any chance?
215000	216000	Yeah.
216000	217000	Okay.
217000	219000	Would you like to come up or...
219000	220000	Okay, come on up.
220000	223000	Let's bring that albino up.
223000	224000	Wait, I haven't plugged in.
224000	225000	Play some albino music.
225000	227000	This is a guy with a resonant beef.
227000	229000	I also hate the sun.
229000	231000	You're a friend of the podcast, aren't you?
231000	232000	Yes.
233000	234000	What was your name again?
234000	235000	Wait, don't tell me.
235000	236000	Jax.
236000	237000	Turbo.
237000	238000	Turbo.
238000	239000	Scorpion.
240000	241000	Caitlin.
241000	242000	Caitlin.
242000	243000	Caitlin, yeah.
243000	244000	I knew it was cool.
244000	245000	Thank you.
245000	246000	How have you been?
246000	247000	Not too bad.
248000	250000	This heat wave, huh?
251000	253000	When you were talking about beef,
253000	256000	we're living in a world where people complain about a lot of things
256000	258000	and I get that and everybody should have the right,
258000	261000	but every day I wake up and the center of our solar system
261000	263000	is actively trying to murder me.
264000	268000	So what is your physical interaction with albinism?
268000	269000	How do you say it?
269000	270000	So I'm albinistic.
270000	273000	So albinos have the pink eyes.
273000	276000	This is going to be kind of, you know, clip triggering.
276000	278000	Yeah, it's going to piss some people off.
278000	279000	Albinos have the clip note.
279000	283000	Yeah, they have the pink eyes and they can see well,
283000	285000	but they look like pedophiles and they're the ones who are freaks.
285000	286000	Come on.
287000	290000	No, look at all the movies when the pink eye ones.
290000	291000	Okay.
291000	294000	So then I have the color in front of my eyes,
294000	295000	but I have vision problems.
295000	299000	I'm legally blind and the same amount of sun burning happens.
299000	302000	So you're saying more human being, like blue eyes,
302000	304000	not that pink eyes aren't human being,
304000	306000	but like I was saying, like more.
306000	308000	This albino is racist.
309000	314000	You're saying that having a more common color eye,
314000	318000	you still have worse vision than a pink eyed albino.
318000	322000	So albinos, the albinos have 20-20 vision generally.
322000	323000	They don't have any problems.
323000	325000	They just have pink eyes.
325000	329000	Albinistic people have vision problems
329000	331000	and they don't have the pink eyes.
331000	332000	So there are two different things,
332000	335000	but when everybody's like, hey, you albino, I'm like, yep.
335000	336000	Yeah.
336000	339000	Because I don't want to like deal with the explain.
339000	342000	Is your tongue abnormally red by albinistic thing?
342000	343000	Nope.
343000	344000	I just had a red vine.
344000	345000	You had a lolly cat.
345000	346000	There you are.
346000	347000	I just had a red vine.
347000	348000	You have a shockingly red tongue right now.
348000	349000	Yeah.
349000	350000	So I'm glad it's filming because I just had a red vine.
350000	351000	I'm like, I'm not going to go up.
351000	352000	I'm in the corner.
352000	353000	I'm so sorry.
353000	354000	I'm just curious.
354000	355000	I'm going to go up.
355000	356000	All right.
356000	357000	Thanks.
357000	358000	You're back.
358000	359000	Yeah.
359000	360000	I'm going to go up.
360000	361000	I'm going to go up.
361000	362000	Yeah.
362000	365000	Just relax with, cause we have, we have w our friend, Victor Varnado,
365000	366000	who's been our friend for ages.
366000	369000	Like it occurs to me now that you're talking about this, that he has.
369000	370000	God did the languages.
370000	371000	I'm fucking minefield.
371000	374000	Cause I want to wasn't regular eyes, but.
374000	375000	Yeah.
375000	376000	Non pink eyes.
376000	378000	And I don't think I've ever actually talked to.
378000	379000	A person with.
379000	381000	With the pink eyes, but it's interested.
381000	387320	Yeah, they can drive so are you legally blind or legally blind? Yeah, and you're wearing contacts or can't because I have a stigmatism
387320	388840	So my eyes do this
388840	391720	So no, no, it wasn't sure. What is your field of vision right now?
391720	396080	Like like like a do you have a blurry like kind of field of vision or so what happens for me is like
396560	400200	Like Brandon and I know each other and so like whoa, it's great suits
400360	404920	So he's come to a couple shows and as long as I know what color his suit is. It's great
404920	406960	Otherwise, I'll walk by him and he'll think I'm racist
407400	411960	But it's just I don't recognize I'm like like I don't you walk by and you go get out of my way nigger
414760	417180	I'm just doing a character in my show
418200	420200	Out of my way brown eyes, right?
420680	425240	Wait, what do you mean if you have tails you have to know in advance what color suit he's wearing
425240	429520	So for me like to to kind of deal with the world
429960	436880	When you see the sign that says like Ash Avenue, you got your a you got your s and h what I see
436960	439000	I can spell I see a green. Thank you
439000	442760	I see a green triangle and like two little like green squares
442760	447040	Like I make the shapes out before I see them. Okay, because I can see color differentiating really
447680	452320	Differentiation really well, but not right not anything else. So you're not allowed to have a driver's license. Oh
453520	456920	So what is I don't know how deep you've dug into the science of it
456920	459920	But the interesting thing to me is that we're talking about pigmentation here
459920	462880	And so isn't it that the the albino folk?
463440	464880	The reason their eyes are pink
464880	470040	I assume has something to do with a with an extension of this whole problem, which is like pigmentation
470040	473200	They can take so if your eyes are pigmented quote-unquote
474080	476080	adequately
477000	484760	Why is it the eyes are less functional so my brother and sister are both freakishly also albinistic which is pretty much impossible and
485360	486840	I
486840	491120	They would know better than me because they studied it. So that's not a recessive or dominant trait
491480	494920	No, it is but the fact that it happened all three of us is a
495800	499640	Freakin nature according to Greg or Mendel. It should be happening to like one of you
499640	500040	Yeah
500040	504680	If you have four kids like he learned that with the peas it should have happened once and not again
504680	510760	My mom and dad have a recessive G. My dad is Italian. My mom is Irish. She's redhead. My dad's a soiree the Italian
510880	518280	This is not supposed to happen. My brother's older. It happened three times, but they know a lot about the milk man is albino
518280	523640	I'm sure this joke gets told every fucking family reunion. I'm sorry
524000	525200	You know what? That's weird
525200	530080	My family has no sense of humor I guess because I thought they did but that makes more sense that one albino
530080	533680	Which is banging my mom three times but a lot of?
534840	537680	to cut you off you have your hair is
538520	545320	Fantastic like you you have like what a lot of people to pay a lot of money for is just this like beautiful like silvery
546160	552080	Last time I was here 16 inches. Yep. Yep when you donated to like charity. Absolutely not
552080	556320	I was so poor I had to sell it to the movies shit to the movies. I had to yeah
556360	562640	But like like to like I would like to think and I can't prove it that the Targaryen chick is wearing mine
562640	568040	Oh, let's just plant that seed you think Daenerys was wearing your hair. I hope so
568040	570400	Do you have a pretty sure that it went to Hulk Hogan?
570400	572400	I
573680	575880	Do you have any idea any of the Eagles
577080	580040	why it is mythically the because I
580840	584960	When I see an albinistic person with albinistic features
584960	588960	I can't I can't avoid thinking about the word angel
588960	595200	Which I'm sure is like problematic to the albinistic community our friend Victor's been cast as an angel many times
595400	598320	It's what is it?
598320	605760	What do you have any idea about that like the the origin of like why we portray angels as like white haired and well in the
605760	611500	Bible like like in revelation when Jesus comes back the first time in the very beginning he talks about his hair like
612000	617420	Dressed in white his feet like burnished bronze his whole like, you know, clothed in white white white white thing
617420	621000	So I guess when albiners were born, that's why you know
621000	624960	It's they're also getting cannibalized in Africa because they think they're magic as well
625200	628160	So is there's well, that's no way to treat magic. I know
628200	631960	Well, no, no, if you eat if you eat an albino thigh bone, you can raise the debt
631960	634880	It's what they're thinking there. So I mean, well, that is true
635920	641360	Yeah, but I I mean is there a part of it is right? Right. Absolutely. Oh, yeah, just the thigh bone or
642880	648080	Example they like they take trophies from albino because there's actually more albinism in in
648440	653240	African genes than in white you mean after they die of natural cause no, okay
653600	658200	Because I would eat the part of the albino that allow that magically created more albinos if I die
658200	661040	I'm gonna do an organ donor thing that says you can have whatever you want
661520	663520	For you. I appreciate your work
665000	669440	Are there are there parts I'm sorry, this is morbid but are there are there are there other
670000	675440	Like is it just raising the dead? Are there any other like I there's all sorts of things
675440	682240	These people are doing like cocaine and weird African like gunpowder drugs and and making children soldiers
682240	688240	I'm not sure what they're they're doing there all around but like they think that they get power from eating albinos
688240	692640	All right, if you're listening in Africa, we're sorry. I think I'm gonna help one day
692640	697920	I I don't want to overstep my comptroller powers, but I think there's only one way to prove this theory
699040	701040	You want the pinky?
701080	703080	I want that thigh bone
703440	705440	Why does this man insult me?
706040	710920	Did you happen to hear the episode recently where we had a kind of a
712440	714200	shockingly
714200	715960	adept
715960	717800	self-effacingly
717800	721320	neophyte dermatological scientist up here. You know
722240	725720	And he counseled me on my Polish skin tags
726720	730960	that are out of control and I gotta go get him like removed and stuff, but I
732160	734160	Don't know. I was curious about that like
734840	736240	I
736240	740620	Do albinistic folk? I make him sound like Irish fairies
741760	744680	Try to be PC and I'm just making everyone sound like a fairy
747000	751040	Do they do what's the relationship between like
751640	759000	You seem pretty young so you probably wouldn't know but like like for like do you get fucking shit growing off you like I do
759000	764280	I have little us sunspots and stuff like that from and I don't go in the Sun very often
764280	767680	but yeah, you were saying that the reason that you have a right to complain is that you have a
768240	772280	Hate relationship with the Sun if there's a crack in the window. I wake up every day and go fuck
773000	778440	Like there's a line of sunburn on my face. So you just burn even I can burn about 20 minutes
778560	782840	Really and and it's incredibly dangerous, right because I mean, it's like a cancer ray
782840	786560	It's like it's like like if it's I mean, do you know numbers on that?
786640	788280	Like you hear horror stories
788280	793240	It's like if I spend an hour and a half in the Sun with nothing on like I could it would be lethal
793240	794680	I'm so good at avoiding it
794680	798880	I'm lucky enough to have a career where I can kind of make my own hours and I know enough about you know
798880	801480	North Hollywood and Hollywood shade to run into the right corners
802080	805400	I don't and also I'm hoping that if every you know
805400	809560	It's a Highlander thing like every albino or albinist person that dies I get stronger
809560	813920	Oh, so I don't want to I don't want to educate anyone on this. I
814720	817840	Don't because each of them is a pocket of darkness shadow power
817880	822100	Yeah, so when they crack open and there's this dark energy goes into you
822640	829960	And it counteracts the Sun does that split between all the albino people or do you just get all of the deaths worth of value?
829960	834160	I'm thinking that my because of my lack of because I have a pretty strong vehicle
834160	838180	I could probably help and since I'm not I'm thinking that negative energy is pulling a little more my way
838180	839860	All right, you got a stronger gravity
839940	844080	Yeah, when when when you run into Kaylin when you run into like a full-on
845620	847620	There's a delineation between
847620	853060	Albino and albinistic when you would when you meet somebody I mean I imagine you have
853420	858260	That's like with the pink eye thing and you meet them. Is there any kind of
858780	860780	like tension between that like
861980	865260	Like have you seen the movie warriors like a rival gang? Yeah, I
866140	873260	I don't know. Like I'm so I'm so rent with them ever alone. You never disconnected the West Side Story kind of thing
873260	879700	I'm so bound up with like social anxiety. Anyway, I've done a couple photo shoots for like out like awareness and things like that
879700	883740	and then so we had every all kinds of of different pigmentless people and
884540	889300	I met them and everything was fine. But at the same time, I'm just nervous around anybody, right?
889300	893900	So but in the back of my mind, I was like, you know, you can drive so fuck you. Yeah
894500	898980	Yeah, they've got privilege. I mean, they're they probably I know how many albinists are alba
898980	905580	I know people you've met who have passed for albinistic and taken advantage of go they could put contacts in those asshole
905580	907580	Oh my god
907580	914980	Drive a car. It looks Scandinavian. I'm Italian and everyone's like, are you Scandinavian? No, I'm just sad
917900	920100	All right, I'm getting fired up well
920740	924100	Well, as always we we appreciate you being vulnerable with us
924100	929300	I wish I could believe me the Sun is my enemy too, but boy the enemy of my enemy. I
930460	935300	Mean, I wish there was something we could do. Yeah, you know, I call the Sun orange Hitler
937500	939500	And from this day forward
942620	945260	Yeah, I hate it I want to put a hat over my pool
946260	950180	You could put an umbrella that goes out. Yeah, that's kind of like I'm thinking about it
950180	952180	And then I feel like people make fun and go
952940	957660	Sexy like, you know like in the cabanas like those. Yeah curvy they go out like that
957660	960860	So you have a shady spot always and you swim there like no, I'm being active
960900	965780	Yeah, I just happen to be swimming actively in the shade. You're not you're just hanging out hiding
965780	971260	I might build a wall around it and then put a ceiling on the walls and then an air conditioner
971260	973260	So just be an indoor pool. Yeah
974260	979020	That's called a house you worked hard enough you deserve. Yeah, you do it
979020	981740	Yeah, or or or have an indoor pool
981740	983860	I guess if you ever been to the Hearst mansion
983860	987860	It's like he's getting like pools are like they start outside and then they go inside
987860	989020	But only if you're in the pool
989020	993220	Like if you're a burglar you could try to rob the house by but you'd have to go in the pool
993220	996420	And then there's like pools that have hallways like pool hallways
997700	999020	That's so badass
999100	1004100	I mean like like like like if you're you have an indoor pool and people are swimming or there and it's like can you imagine?
1004100	1009780	It's like it's like hey come come over here and people are like going down the pool hallway to do pool coke
1010900	1015380	Wait, why is there a pool hallway? Is there a pool bathroom? That's what I want to know if you go around the corner
1015380	1018100	Is there like there are urinals that you could you can hang up your
1019100	1022140	Your towel underwater over there. He's got pool rooms
1022180	1027820	So you have a pool right here and then you swim down a canal and there's another pool over here
1027820	1033060	And he's got like three pools in one big pool house, and it's the dopest shit
1033060	1036980	That's what I got excited about his dumbass house a water pool
1037540	1042300	The pool urinals are cool, but the pool sit-down toilets. They're kind of like a work-in-progress
1042820	1048660	It's putting too much power in the hands of the consumer in my opinion usually it works, but then if you have diarrhea
1049540	1057340	Still working that out if every single one of your guests is this is is not totally trustworthy like and and and capable
1057340	1061620	It's a it's a you need a pool guard who watches what the people eat before they go in the pool
1062020	1066860	Shrimp ceviche if you have two plates of that you should not be in the pool the pool dietitian
1066860	1069060	Yeah, like somebody who's just there ready. Yeah
1070100	1075420	Vacuum, it's not gonna work. How amazing would it be if you are so rich and technology was so
1076500	1079060	Accurate or whatever you call it that people could come over to your house
1079060	1081300	And just like hang out in your pool your whole house
1081300	1087180	Just had a pool everywhere like every room had a little pool part of it so that technically you could just swim to any room
1087420	1092060	And just be like a different class of citizen like I'm one of the aqua people here
1092060	1094100	I am in the charades game by
1094660	1101220	But at any point in that in that water you could shit or piss or puke or drop fucking anything
1101220	1105820	And it would all just go and just like float away to the nearest filter
1106460	1108820	Like you just crystallized my dream
1108820	1112860	Yeah, like you can just float around like a little baby like peeing poo poo
1113300	1118420	You can just be in the water you go inside for the winter like you start to see the seasons change the leaves fall
1118420	1122620	And you go out they go in and then you hunt you cannot hibernate and shit everywhere
1122620	1125440	You're saying that you just want to live in a very efficient toilet
1126220	1132220	Yeah, the biggest toilet no toilet paper to worry about don't get the bear anymore. No, no, it's brilliant
1132220	1136740	It's kind of what the internet is right? It's everybody it's every human expressing how they'd like life to be like
1136740	1141140	Oh, I'd like to be in contact with every human being and I'd like to admit whatever I want
1141180	1144980	But I don't want to ever touch anything that comes out of me or out of anyone else
1144980	1149580	The problem is the filter on the internet's bad and we're all backed up. So now we're all like knee-deep and shit
1149580	1157620	No problem is we need a pool dietitian for the internet. Thank you. You get it because they just shit. Yeah
1158940	1162320	How would we elect this pool addition? I'll do it
1163820	1165820	my second I
1166020	1168460	Don't really like I don't think people should the French
1169260	1173160	Should discuss religion or politics Steve, can you bring?
1174700	1176200	Thanks
1176200	1182040	You just came up with like a 1980s first bullet. No, he's a politic. He's a politician
1182040	1189900	I'm a politician. I just stole I just appropriated Brandon's joke. Well, when I heard politician, I thought you misheard pool dietitian
1189900	1191900	I thought it was a dietitian
1192300	1197620	Politicians way better. He said pool nutrition. All right. He said pool dietitian. He said pool
1205380	1209100	That's how it happened. I just got every dance vote in the joke
1210940	1216380	Welcome welcome to my political arty notice. There's no pee in it. Oh
1216660	1217940	Oh
1217940	1223420	Let's keep it that what is going on with the conspicuous timing of the when did we I think Steve
1223420	1228540	Lavey likes to bring it out in dramatic fashion in the middle of the show to make it like a like we should get
1228540	1230540	him a cape I
1230980	1235180	Think he's like the Phantom of our opera and he likes to bring in a half mask
1235180	1240460	He likes to bring out the vodka. Where is he trying to tempt me into health? Like let's see how long
1240820	1241940	I
1241940	1244420	Don't do it. Like yeah, I don't want to enable him
1244420	1250100	So I'm leaving it out like like I'm until he really asks for it. And then I just look I'm here to help but
1251180	1257780	Levy, you should scream it like from the rooftops that you want it. I hear I'm coming. Oh, here it comes. Yeah
1260300	1266980	Dramatic fashion. All right, Levy sit please sit down. Thank you. You can't just tell a human being to sit like a
1267740	1269740	Hello carrier
1271220	1273220	Explain yourself
1274940	1278340	Half of it is forgetting and half of it is
1279860	1285460	Strategy I think Oh forgetting must be nice. Unfortunately. My vodka is never out here
1286940	1291300	Strategy for what what's the what's the strategic ploy here? You know, it's
1291860	1294820	We keep it on the rails a little bit in the beginning. Oh
1297620	1299460	To time out dance blackouts
1299460	1301860	I forget which one it was but you were like, you know
1301860	1305860	I think I may have just too much in the beginning and I was like well
1305860	1310020	You know if I don't give it 15 minutes like via give you your 20
1310940	1316260	Well, I think the danger is more like it's it's about before the show if I pregame before the show
1316260	1318260	We're just fucked, you know. Yeah
1319340	1321340	Yeah
1321860	1323860	Shit
1323980	1329100	Like the Yardley Smith episode I just I got yeah, I think that might have been the one where you're like, you know
1329100	1330260	I was nervous
1330260	1334500	It's ironic because they get nervous about certain people and then I'm like I wanted to do a good job
1334500	1336500	But then I'm like, well, that's not how you're gonna do a good job
1336500	1341140	You fucked up with Norman Lear and then I'm like this. So then I'm like a little Dutch courage
1341140	1345860	I woke up that episode is classic. It was an awesome year. I was right was there
1345860	1349360	I was I was afraid of Norman Lear and because he was facing you
1349800	1354080	Anytime I jumped in and said something and he couldn't quite hear it. I think he thought I was attacking him
1354200	1356200	Yeah, well, you probably were
1356800	1360300	Never I would never attack Norman. He told us that great story
1361360	1367480	I forget which famous actor but it was like the dick in the hotel room
1368960	1370960	Did he tell us that
1372600	1374600	Yeah, something about a dick in a hotel room
1374600	1376600	You
1377880	1381680	Know who I speak in a Norman Lear cuz you know who was in the green room and I guess he was like
1381680	1384560	He couldn't wait to come out tell normally or then he wasn't on the show do mortgage
1384560	1387000	I ran into do mortgage on Hollywood Boulevard like I
1387600	1393960	Don't like 230 in the morning or something. He was straight sober. Like I was coming off of a
1394480	1396480	adventure and
1396720	1399920	Just trying as you play spider-man until about midnight. Yeah
1400880	1402880	Yeah
1403240	1408000	But I just ran a job and they're like the corner like like real close to where a sinner space used to be like Holly
1408000	1412260	Yeah, and it was like holy shit. It's do orange and we talked for like it felt like an hour
1412800	1418720	But and then it was just like is it like like deserted Hollywood Boulevard and then I went on my way
1418960	1422960	It's nice to see him. What was the origin of your adventure? What did you just come off?
1422960	1428600	I met with Joel McHale and Chris McKenna and that's already a lot of mix to like
1429320	1435040	You know just throw at an evening. So by the by the time we finished dinner
1436400	1438960	McKenna and I were like really?
1442120	1444320	Erin the girl I was dating on Erin McGathey
1444320	1449080	But Erin who I was dating when I was actively working at my hardest on community she observed
1449080	1454720	She's like you and McKenna bring out the best and worst in each other and like like McKenna and I were like
1454720	1460380	We were like yelling at McHale like like like, why do you love your family more than drinking?
1462040	1464040	Come out with us like like just
1464520	1469980	We were just 17 years old. We're just actively trying to get a man to break up with his family
1470800	1475800	Because we wanted to go to the frolic room and and then we didn't go to the frolic room
1475800	1483760	We went we stumbled into this other place that came before it at least this dark bar that only had one other guy in it
1483880	1487480	And and I will say to this guy's credit
1487640	1494040	He did the one thing that usually like I've never I don't think I've ever heard from the obnoxious drunk third guy at the bar
1494120	1499280	Which is he just blatantly sad after listening to us for 20 minutes. He's like, you know
1499280	1506280	What I can't hear you that good and I'm fascinated by what you're saying. So I'm gonna move one down so I can eavesdrop
1508080	1512400	That's quite a compliment and I was like, all right, well can't fault that
1513360	1519500	We're in a public place if we wanted privacy we'd leave and it was like, well, what do you do? I'm a data scientist
1519500	1522040	Oh, yeah, I'm a flavor chef
1523880	1531840	Like it's it's it's it's rare when that your job title belies the fakeness of it. I'm a I'm a water surfer
1533320	1538360	Okay, oh one of those you wanted to make it sound a little more realistic, but you blew it
1538640	1540640	Yeah
1540640	1545520	Data scientist I asked him a five question. He's like, why is that so funny?
1545520	1550600	I'm like because literally all science is data science all of it
1552200	1558240	Does that mean he's one of those people that like like just just data input like he's like he ain't shit he's drunk
1559120	1562800	He's trying to live a secret life of Walter Mitty. Like it's like
1563560	1568560	He just wanted to make up a job the the the answer was whatever what I don't know
1568560	1571540	like, I don't know he did something that had to do with like
1572640	1576520	It was like data. It was data, but it wasn't science
1576520	1580720	He goes and tries different flavors of Kellogg's cornflakes and sees if they're good
1581240	1585600	That's data science. It actually had to do with like he was basically like it was almost like data
1586160	1592480	anti-science if you want to know the truth because it had to do with like stuff about housing loans like banks hire him
1593160	1594640	to
1594640	1596640	make numbers
1596920	1599520	Fucking dance in favor of the status quo
1599960	1604280	Like like like like spit would you say he's like a book cooker it?
1604280	1606560	Well, it's more like it's kind of like you never you know
1606560	1612080	Like you watch the documentaries about like the guys that were behind climate change denial or like or like tobacco
1612640	1617560	Like you know, it's like when politics meets science. He's like a think-tanker
1618080	1623720	Yeah, like he was he's kind of a guy that you call like he's a he's a data spinner
1624520	1627640	Ain't no science about it. It's very much not science
1628160	1632120	What he does he's a cherry pen. He actually was getting drunk. I truly to his credit
1632120	1636840	I think he was getting drunk because he's ashamed of it when he actually got to the bottom of it
1637520	1640920	And was explaining what he did not like you that was trying to talk out
1641640	1643640	I'm
1645840	1652280	Yeah, it's true I get drunk because I love myself I'm like yay who wants to overhear me
1653440	1657880	And then you just meet people are like I'd like to spike my own wrists open
1657880	1661120	That's why I'm drinking like all right. Tell me about yourself. I won't remember
1661120	1673440	But the bartender was also very interesting 12 years sober and
1674480	1678840	Sometimes you run into a bartender who's like like very rock-solid sober
1678840	1682760	It takes you back a little but they there's a certain
1683120	1688560	There's a Venn diagram of people between sober people and bartenders. It's like I'm in my sweet spot
1688560	1696260	This is where I could this is how I stay sober if nothing like like they're great bartenders because they were
1696840	1699240	Alcoholics once and they're never gonna be again
1699240	1704680	And they they have empathy for people that are there for the right or wrong reasons
1704680	1710640	They they they have a sharp instinct for when to cut off when to over pour when to 86 when to call a cab
1710640	1714560	and this guy was talking about like how it was the
1715480	1720600	It was 12 years ago when he saw the episode of Cheers in in reruns where
1721240	1725320	There's a specific episode of Cheers that I remember does he described it?
1725320	1728440	I was like oh yeah that episode for sure and the lights go out and Sam's alone in the bar
1728440	1731560	And then he pours one and then he slides it down the bar and it's like yeah
1731560	1733360	Yeah, that one that one I was like, you know
1733360	1737360	That got me going about Cheers and how Cheers is great a show and everybody in my generation
1737360	1742280	I'll tell you like and and stuff and he's like he said something like he's like yeah, and I yeah
1742600	1744600	I
1744600	1747600	Think it was like that was before Norm died
1748800	1753000	And I was like Norm died. How many episodes of Cheers have you seen is like?
1754160	1758360	One or two what Cheers changed your life, and you never watched another episode
1758960	1766120	How do you know the third episode you watch of Cheers wouldn't wouldn't make you a millionaire like like you all you watch one episode
1766120	1770300	It magically transforms your fucking life, and you just you're just like that fuck it. I'll watch fire escape now
1772280	1776400	Didn't norm die. No, I'm didn't know he never died and anyone that ever cared
1776400	1782240	I mean coach he met coach no no he did well, okay, if he did mean that that he's still it's just funny
1782240	1786800	He wasn't a Cheers fan. He just saw that episode and it changed his life. That's what's funny
1786800	1792760	He didn't then watch 200 episodes of Cheers. He just was like what a fun episode or whatever the fuck that was
1793560	1796360	He just got militant about Cheers for a second about coach
1797920	1799920	I've told the story before on the show about
1800480	1803480	Being at a bar with with George went right
1804400	1807520	Probably like yeah, well I did long story short
1809000	1810960	Sudeikis is his nephew
1810960	1815720	George went to nephew we went out to which is why like Nicolas cagey changed his name. He didn't want that went
1820760	1825560	No we went we went to see a band the troubadour, which is a square or rectangular shaped bar
1826160	1831600	George went was high because that he and Jason Sudeikis likes to smoke a little weed and
1833000	1839400	Norm sat at the exact spot where Norm would sit at Cheers on the corner of the left side of the bar and
1841200	1845080	People were losing their fucking minds because everybody else is high too like
1846920	1848920	Like I just moved here from Cincinnati
1849760	1855600	Fucking norm is right there having a beer and the same stool that he would occupy and
1856120	1859600	He was like sign a sign in people's tits. It was awesome
1862960	1867840	Did you sit on this chair on purpose and did that person ask for their tits to be signed
1870280	1872280	It was a different time
1873120	1877400	It was a simpler time for a time. They wanted an autograph. They didn't have a napkin
1879920	1882840	Or to a weepy ratzenberger over in the corner
1885520	1892680	Levy how's your relationship going? It's going well. Well you got you got a new squeeze. Yeah, I got a new squeeze. All right
1892680	1895960	Yeah, so here's something that concerns me. I
1898440	1900440	Know where this is going
1900920	1908040	Cody asked to see a photo of her and you said you didn't have one why we hadn't taken pictures of each other
1908200	1911040	Also, she's not like a fan of being photographed
1911840	1913200	well, that's
1913200	1916120	That's that's does she live by Niagara Falls
1917120	1919120	Yeah, we
1920640	1926720	Yeah, we want we want to respect her obviously yeah, but we also want to question her existence. How do we do this?
1926720	1928720	How do we walk this tightrope?
1928800	1930800	how do we
1930800	1932800	authenticate the fact that you actually have a
1933040	1937440	Since that conversation, I actually took a photo of her. She begrudgingly
1938880	1940880	Yelling at her substrate
1942640	1946400	My boss's fiance wants to know you exist. Yeah. Yeah
1947480	1952560	She was not thrilled to be taking the pictures. But yeah, I took I took a couple pictures
1953120	1955120	All right. Well
1956200	1960800	Does she live in town is she a local? Yeah, she's a local. Yeah, and how long has been going on?
1961520	1968440	Four months. Are you are you happy you feeling good? Yeah, she wasn't at Comic Con. Was she? No, no, okay. Yeah
1968920	1973360	All right. I was with you every step of the way. I know cuz you were making out with that one girl and I was
1974880	1976880	Just kidding
1977640	1979640	Shirley
1982360	1986080	Surely yeah, she could have like a code name. I guess surely
1986800	1991040	She could have been at Comic Con and you wouldn't have known because she'd be dressed up some sort of
1991720	1997240	Harmon fan like she could have been a mr. Rick. She could have been a meecee. Yeah
1997840	2000600	Yeah, she could have looked like anything Dan wouldn't recognize it
2002680	2004680	He doesn't know what she looks like
2008240	2013040	You might have seen my girlfriend at Comic Con she was dressed like Harley Quinn shit
2013960	2019240	Less Harley Quinn's this year. Yeah, they're celebrating or demanding just
2020200	2023040	Just trying to offer up a subject
2023760	2028600	Did you see the Harley Quinn trailer? No, the Harley Quinn show
2028600	2036880	There's a Harley Quinn animated show and she's like shit. Fuck that Batman shit. Oh shit. Fuck. What the fuck's going on shit
2037080	2039080	That's not your mom's Harley Quinn
2039560	2044360	It's weird because it looks like all the other DC animated shows, but it's just like this
2044680	2049800	Here's what makes this one different. She's just like what the shit what the fuck and the Joker's like wow
2051680	2054320	Joke me this and she's like fuck fuck
2056080	2060720	There's something to be said for your mom's Harley Quinn, you know, I mean I like the idea
2060720	2062240	It's what's also kind of funny about it though
2062240	2068400	Is I have the sneaking suspicion because I watched the trailer only once but I'm like Batman's not joining in on this game
2068520	2073040	Like I saw you I imagine that they're like look Harley Quinn's kind of like Deadpool or whatever
2073040	2079120	You can like go crazy with her and like but she's surrounded by all these icons of the DC
2079120	2084280	Universe drawn in that same style, but she's the only one so one of them's just like ah fiddlesticks
2084280	2088040	And she's like fucking ain't right about that shit shit on a dick and pussy
2088880	2091720	We got a Joker. Let's fucking kill Batman
2092280	2094280	No sweat my pet
2095680	2097680	She sounds like hardly Quinn
2098200	2103120	Yeah, hardly Harla Quinn. Yeah, hardly hardly Harla Quinn
2104120	2106120	I'm having a stroke and nobody's helping
2107040	2114600	Nobody is how hard the Harley Quinn rest in peace Brandon Johnson. He died as he lived in the solar plexus
2115240	2117120	committing to
2117120	2119120	poorly fleshed out bits
2122640	2124640	Oh
2124640	2126640	Sleep sleep sleep
2128000	2131640	Go gentle into that good night. Oh shit. He was the only guy I knew up here
2135040	2140840	Spencer have you ever cosplayed have you ever gone out into the cosplay universe? No, I got I got this is like not
2140840	2146720	This is not a cool belief these days because you're supposed to be I don't know
2146720	2147880	I don't even want to label it
2147880	2154900	But I think that cosplays look really good when you look something like the character obviously anyone can be any character all the time
2154900	2158120	But like I've always wanted to like you know find someone
2158120	2163680	I look like and I don't look like very much at anything. Who would you go if you had to like get get?
2164240	2170160	Styled as a cosplay character you could you know whatever you wanted look exactly like that person who would it be?
2170160	2175840	There's this guy's husband in an anime that I look kind of like he's like just this big fat guy
2175840	2180760	He's like he's like giant. You're not fat. You're skinny, but he's just like a big giant guy
2181400	2188160	If like anime fat yeah, oh, I'm anime guys go a woman's husband fat for sure
2188320	2194720	What's the name of this character? I can't remember his name. She's generally called husband the woman's called teacher
2194960	2196960	How much he's her husband how much?
2197920	2204960	Recognition do you think that would get on the comic-con floor with people would be like I did not but it's very generic the costume
2204960	2208640	So like I don't think I think they just think I was a big fat guy
2209040	2214960	Right if if they like it's a it's a if you nailed an anime if you nailed it to perfection
2214960	2218120	Do you think someone go? Oh fuck? You're the husband from the thing. I hope so
2218120	2220120	Yeah, I would like to see you
2220960	2227040	Gain a little of your weight back shave your beard cut your hair and be the plump guy
2227360	2230000	from the original lion Voltron and
2230720	2236520	And we could be like the kid that like glasses one or whatever. Yeah the green one with the glass
2236520	2242640	Yes, I like that. You know these days you could go as fat Thor. It's great. Not you like me
2242640	2249240	It's like anyone could be fat Thor now. It's a great cosplay for people who want to look like they're their characters your Thor
2250040	2252040	Yeah, I could barely fit down
2252680	2254680	It's my favorite jokes. Oh

2275600	2278880	Dan cosplay cosplay go
2280760	2282320	Like really knock it out of the park
2282320	2287380	You can walk down the main drag of the comic-con and people would freak the fuck out and take photos with you
2287680	2289680	or you could just be
2289680	2293640	Like a real deep track that only a couple people like were hip to well
2293640	2299600	I can't go as Zizek, but like the what's his name? Don't know what that is. He's a philosopher guy
2299600	2303560	He's just a guy that looks so much like me that people would just it wouldn't even they'd be like well
2303560	2306140	You wear a white t-shirt and it's got a stain on it. Mm-hmm
2306520	2308520	Like it's the stains on a different spot
2309960	2316640	You google him you told a great story that the night we were walking from the boat back to the hotel
2316640	2322440	You're telling it Adam. Did you reminded Adam divine how you first met them? Oh, yeah
2322440	2329320	I've told that story at least twice. Yeah, how the the workaholics guys got got like got not really me, but another guy. Yeah
2330120	2336320	There the fast-forward versions. There was a guy that was at this at this party and he kept asking me questions about New Zealand and
2336960	2341080	I was like I've I kept going like no, I don't I'm not sure
2341600	2346240	It was like and then it culminated me going I've never been to New Zealand. So I don't know he's like, okay real funny
2346240	2351920	You've been to New Zealand. I'm like, oh, I haven't and he got you get this look on his face that just melted into
2354000	2360860	Humiliation and rage and like all kinds of things and he pointed a thrust his finger over to where the workaholics guys were all
2360860	2364200	Standing and giggling and said those guys told me you were Peter Jackson
2369600	2376080	But we I kind of got two-thirds of the workaholics back this comic-con on accident because Justin and I
2376400	2380400	Led everybody over to the Hilton under the auspices of like hey
2380880	2383700	everyone's going to the Hilton other we got to the Hilton and it was like
2384720	2387280	Everyone with a room here because we're going to bed. I
2389600	2391840	Didn't mean to get him back and it certainly wasn't his art
2391840	2398080	Did you get another boat with the Game of Thrones people like no Game of Thrones people this year far escape, right?
2398080	2402800	Yeah, far escape. Yeah, we talked about this last week. I believe I was I was do it again
2402800	2406360	I was being a water jug and not being on stage last week. That was fun
2406360	2410080	You remember when you put the hat on it? Oh, yeah that goddamn Jeff
2413280	2415960	Grow up what I just
2416920	2418960	I'm a I'm a delicate artist
2418960	2424000	And I think that episode the people that don't subscribe to it'll be lost to time
2424280	2428640	But if you if you saw what I did with just found objects
2429280	2431280	I
2431280	2433280	Brandon
2434200	2437440	How's it going in the Rick and Morty Raiders room in your opinion every
2439000	2441000	coming to kill
2444400	2448720	That is where holding a thing is so I'm sad for you is worse
2450080	2452640	We always how is Rick and Morty? Sorry
2454200	2456200	Every day is amazing
2457160	2459160	Is amazing
2459400	2464360	It's a great group. I'm proud of that. It doesn't demoralize anybody that I'm like
2464880	2466720	I'm like the
2466720	2471000	I'm like Beatle Bailey on my own army. I'm like they come in and go
2472360	2474360	Do we really have to stop talking about?
2475680	2482480	Goofy shit and work now. I mean, I don't think you're never gonna meet mr. A and W
2483000	2488000	You know that motherfucker does not know he's drinking out of the bottle. Oh
2489000	2490480	God, I
2490480	2494760	We have to have an intervention for Jeff. He's a he's a focus addict
2496120	2503880	He can't get enough focus. I think these are high-concept bits. He's he's gonna he's gonna die of focus inhalation
2506080	2508080	Every plant got to get water
2508640	2510640	His species of plant is only
2511360	2513360	Viable upstage
2513360	2517720	Yeah, where everyone has to turn their head go. All right. What why is the audience reacting differently?
2517720	2522280	I was literally moving a centimeter a second to try to steal some and then the whole plan
2522280	2529800	It took me like 20 minutes and then it was gone. Is there any correlation between albinism albinistic ness and alcohol tolerance?
2529800	2535520	Well, I don't know. All I know is that some people say they're functioning alcoholics. I'd like to say that I'm a thriving alcoholic
2537920	2539920	It's a bottle of club
2540960	2542960	concept shit I
2544920	2548440	Agree and who knows what will be the next?
2549240	2555680	Escalation if God wanted me to drink water. He wouldn't have made my body 80% of it. You see you're your own
2556480	2560800	Your own shaker. All you have to do is do a couple butterflies and you're mixing your average
2560800	2567000	Damn, put the or the Jeff put the drink on a heart. How did you provoke him tan? You provoked him?
2567000	2574480	What do you call this instrument? He put it on a wardrobe a shipper. Oh, yes a Davenport. It's a yes
2575320	2577560	Let's stop. Don't stop doing the podcast
2580720	2582720	Come on hardly Quinn
2585400	2591640	Politician was amazing so amazing that it didn't even it was like get the high watermark. Yeah, I made it from I was like
2592360	2595160	poor Brandon the sound system was like
2595800	2602560	Reverbing he's someone said pool dietitian and he's repeat repeating it wrong and you're like you're bringing us up to a new level
2603880	2608920	Pool addition. It was good. I mean, you know corn and cheese are my specialty
2611040	2613480	It was no it was no hardly Quinn
2614400	2618320	Well, don't you're trying to sabotage them because you're jealous. Where's the but you didn't you?
2619320	2623040	Right behind you on the thing. Do you get it Easter? Oh, you got it
2626160	2631240	I'd go but I'd knock everything over. So where is that Easter?
2634160	2636160	Milwaukee
2642400	2646720	That's what you when you're in a family unit where it's like, you know, the after-school specials
2646720	2649080	They pour the bottles down the sink triumphantly
2649640	2653760	Sometimes it's a little more complicated that you go to the second like well goddamn. We're not alcoholics
2653760	2655760	We should store this somewhere where we can have it
2656280	2658280	Just in case we change our mind
2658920	2662000	She's the one with the problem. I'm putting this on the backseat of my car
2662000	2666600	We few mason jars mom's not gonna put do any cherry jelly this year. Just throw them in the back
2668280	2675560	We're a proud tribe Milwaukee ins you would like it there. I believe I love the Midwest especially in the winter
2675600	2682800	Why because it's cold and dark. Oh, okay. I'm fine with both of those things. I didn't know it was dark. Oh, yeah
2683760	2685760	I was here. I was at the NPR
2686400	2692400	Radiolab is they're they're they're they're doing this multi-part series about the history of people
2692920	2694920	studying intelligence and the
2695000	2697440	all the problems that's caused throughout history and
2697800	2704180	Talk talking about the eugenics craze that being very soft on eugenics. I feel I don't know that
2704680	2709880	Tweeting about this recently. Yeah, I'm really upsetting. They soft on eugenics. Yeah these past two episodes
2709880	2716600	They're like, there's this crazy guy talking about this cool new science. They call it eugenics. Are we talking about the same thing? Yeah
2716600	2723160	Yeah, the last two episodes they brought it they've been like really diving in desks. Oh this guy invented it
2723160	2729160	He's a Nazi like it. They're not talking about that. Like it's it's that the distinct links to Nazism
2729560	2735320	Like both of those episodes like Chad was like these are Nazis. It's like an aside
2735320	2738640	But that's that's that's all the time they spent on it. It's like no
2738680	2743120	That's the whole that all it is is these are Nazis you say that once it made me
2743120	2747600	I don't want to certainly don't want to be the devil's advocate in this conversation. But yeah
2748200	2754680	Do it because it's literally the devil. I'm advocating for sure. But but but I but I got the imp I
2755960	2757520	Have
2757520	2762600	Have do it. I got the impression that they're that they might have been
2763160	2770240	More being more cautious than they needed to be of God winds law kind of thing like where they're like if we say
2770920	2771960	Nazi
2771960	2773960	Hitler
2774040	2782320	Shit every single time we evoke eugenics like we're gonna miss an opportunity to provoke thought about the root of this shit
2782320	2784680	But the root of it's not see well the root well
2784680	2787340	But but the root but the part of their point is that the root of it
2787820	2792940	Isn't there and I hate to put this fucking arrow in the worst people in the world's quiver, but
2793860	2800940	Eugenics was a craze in America like like like yeah, they swept through us like right around the yeah
2801700	2807220	Picked it up and then the Holocaust happened that like that's a very important dot to connect for America
2807220	2813340	Or is it or is it so hot button that that people stop listening and that might otherwise actually think about well
2813340	2815460	What are those problems of eugenics at the radio lab?
2818060	2825820	No, I just I really made me uncomfortable because it's like you can you can have a bit more context like very interesting stuff
2825820	2827940	They're discussing but like at the end of the recent one
2827940	2829180	They're like, you know
2829180	2835100	Some countries might say it's fine to do eugenic birthing standards and if you don't like that doesn't that make you the real racist?
2835100	2837100	And then like he literally said that
2838060	2843540	Whoa, okay. I didn't hear that one. He's like your imperialist racist in that context or something like that
2844180	2848060	Yeah, it's really interesting stuff. Don't get me wrong. Well, yeah, I will I will I
2849820	2856100	I'd rather have my needle as sensitive as yours. I mean, I I'm afraid of mine getting number
2856100	2861500	I I've achieved like a sort of fetish now for non divisiveness
2861500	2866020	Which is another way of saying like I listen to these guys the the guys that host stuff
2866020	2871980	They don't want you to know and I particularly fetishize their crazy like
2873980	2878580	almost obsessive and highly skilled ability to
2879140	2883340	go into areas that that traditionally are just
2883740	2890580	Like if your decision is to be non divisive then you wouldn't bother to talk about any of this stuff in this area
2890580	2894940	But because they're a conspiracy theory kind of podcast they constantly have to go into these areas
2894940	2900660	But they clearly like pride themselves and have said as much at a certain point after I noticed it
2900660	2905580	And then they said it at one point. I was like, oh, okay. So this is I wasn't hallucinating this you guys are like
2906340	2908340	if they look at
2909060	2911060	humanity's political frailties
2911100	2917660	good bad dark light as like a souffle that they're not gonna collapse by stomping around it and they kind of like
2917900	2919900	they have a gift for
2921060	2923060	Language that
2923740	2930620	Doesn't presuppose particularly anything as they explain things like MK ultra and and all this stuff that you
2930740	2932740	think would be festooned with
2932820	2940620	laser lines and stuff and I don't want to be that person or rather I could never be that person like I wouldn't I don't
2940620	2942940	Think the good version of me makes that a goal
2942980	2947420	but I at the same time I listen to these guys on the way to work now and they kind of
2947660	2949340	they kind of bring me this
2949340	2956540	Taoist ik piece because they're so smart and they're so interested in such fringe shit and yet they clearly not because they're
2956780	2960980	Secretly on the side of the scum of the earth and don't want to lose those ratings
2960980	2963460	but because they have some academic belief that
2964940	2967980	Proper like exploration of stuff shouldn't necessarily
2969580	2971580	ruffle anyone's feathers
2971820	2976460	and that they're just they just want to state things in some weird Jedi way that like
2977660	2984660	Doesn't necessarily feel like like like say Nixon was a bad person even like they they just kind of like
2984820	2990180	It's it's it's it's that's my kick right now. It's probably a dangerous kick. I should be yeah
2990180	2994860	I think not wanting to offend people that are Nazis is part of like why we're in the problem
2994860	2998260	We're having you know, I don't think that's necessarily bad for conspiracy theorists
2998260	3001820	But there is this part of it all though that you do get to take a break
3003020	3008180	Sure. Yeah, like you don't have to be engaging in this bad. There are times I think where you can
3008860	3012660	Objectively just watch something just to tune the fuck out for a second because it's been pretty
3012660	3019400	I think we all can agree that it's been like an onslaught for two years. So I think you more than two years, but like
3019940	3021940	three
3026420	3033180	Yeah, so I do think I do think you can watch something it be Nazi heavy and just be like for a second
3033180	3035180	I kind of just want to watch this thing
3035300	3042340	You know by contrast our nation's president executing like the absolute like divisive fucking sword
3042420	3048140	Like it the only thing that I'm taking in from the news and it should be noted that I'm trying to actively avoid news
3048140	3054900	So the shit that gets to me is fucking gravity fed and it's coming through tons of gravel and like like like
3055140	3060420	it's it it seems uncanny to me that he is absolutely I I I
3061300	3063300	agree with
3063780	3065420	What's his fuck
3065420	3067420	Newt Gingrich is
3067420	3070700	Observation that I read about I know you're bristling you agree with Newt Gingrich
3070740	3077180	I agree with Newt Gingrich's observation that what Trump is doing right now strategically is he's absolutely has to
3077980	3081540	attempt to define everyone left of fascist as
3082660	3087060	Anarchist as socialist he's he's he's he's
3087740	3092460	Looking at the numbers and he's going like I need to double down on all of the race
3093380	3095620	Talk and all of the immigration talk
3096260	3100060	Good for the base. But also what I need to generally do to
3101140	3103860	People out there who are dangerously trying to walk the tightrope
3104460	3105980	He's basically
3105980	3108940	Looking at them as people who are trying to win some kind of like
3109100	3113700	Balance game because there's n and he's shouting in their ear like so you're socialist
3113700	3121580	So you're socialist like in trying to remove from their heads like he's trying to he wants the next election to be about oh
3122220	3127580	Boy, there's just really boy. I would hate to have my home taken away by people of color
3127660	3130460	So, I mean, I'm not that democratic
3131180	3136340	And I thought about that with a reverse trajectory and I was thinking about yeah for a while there
3136340	3138340	wasn't there a little bit of a push to like
3138860	3143340	Wake people of color up to the fact that Democrats had never actually had their back
3143340	3147540	You know that cynical kind of thing where where there was like that push to go like hey
3147540	3148300	What do you know?
3148300	3154340	Look these people have never taken care of you and all that stuff and that feels like that has been jettisoned because the numbers
3154340	3161340	Just never turned around. So now he's like he's condensing all of his strategy on this idea of like
3161580	3167020	He wants you to think that in the game of coke versus Pepsi that Pepsi definitively means
3169620	3172820	Alexandria Cortez gets all of your pants like whether you want it
3173820	3179380	He needs you to be thinking about that like like the same way that you pound home like butter emails
3179420	3184540	You know Benghazi and all that stuff you just pound home that stuff's not all for the hillbillies
3184540	3189300	Oh that that stuff is to try to like scramble the signal of people who might otherwise be
3189420	3195580	Tempted to eat a sandwich take a breath and vote their conscience and to convince them that they're in a war
3197180	3201540	Between between like crazy and what I had yesterday
3202540	3207420	I do I totally agree with Spencer and that that people should might be vigilant
3207420	3211300	But I also I'm getting to the point where I understand that people probably are suffering some fatigue
3211300	3216700	But that's why I mean, that's why I understand what you're saying is like not the time to be like fetishizing
3216900	3217620	Centrism well
3217620	3224580	I just think it's like really important context in a world where there are white nationalists who are pointing to what they call science to
3224740	3231340	Justify their race science and it's like it's an impressive analog that that's what we did for manifest destiny
3231340	3236060	That's how we justified the Westward expansion and the Trail of Tears that followed and then like that
3236300	3239260	Like Nazis literally looked at that and they're like well
3239260	3245260	We're more white than you so you must be on to something and like it is this very trackable thing that started in America
3245260	3246660	It's back in America
3246660	3252860	Arguably never left America and they're just leaving that out in in a perfect contents to bring that up because a big part of their
3252860	3256900	Unit is it is problematic what these what these IQ?
3257780	3262100	Generalities are doing and they do a great job of expressing like the people like for instance
3262500	3267280	Black people can't get their IQ test in the public school system because of this court case
3267340	3272220	Which is just this weird thing because the IQ test was used to put black people in
3272700	3277560	Special ed when they didn't deserve it and like so they do a good job of talking about the bad
3277660	3282300	Elements and even when they're talking about these last two episodes they were it's just like to me
3282300	3289340	It's like it seems doubly important to explain like the historical context of where this developed and they did that just a tiny tiny
3289340	3291340	Bit and I would just like to see you know
3292340	3295580	Understand I could picture them sitting in a room right exactly
3295580	3298140	That's what piss me off. Do we connect this to today?
3298860	3304340	Overtly or do we or do we put one spark plug next to another? I don't know how spark plugs work
3304340	3306980	I don't think they're supposed to clearly
3309100	3312980	They'd probably make it a wire if they wanted to connect them it looks cool
3314140	3320100	Do we put one diode next to another and like hope that and let the listener like form?
3320380	3325640	You know it sure I'm sure that's what they're banking on as it as an editor as a storyteller as a producer
3325640	3327640	I would make an argument. Yeah, I
3328580	3332340	It's like it's like oh, man. Are we gonna like it? We have this weird
3333220	3337820	self-shaming instinct if you're if you're at all left of anything
3338220	3344380	You you you kind of tend to come equipped with this like self policing and right exploitable thing where you're like
3344380	3345740	Oh, was I getting too political?
3345740	3350060	Oh, did I accidentally like soapbox to die like the other side?
3350940	3355140	Doesn't have that self-policing instinct, but they should continue to not have it
3355140	3358220	I that's what makes it the other side, and we should continue to have it
3359260	3363880	It it I don't know man. It's like you you you research like the
3364660	3369140	Back in my day when I was a kid and it was like when I wasn't participating in any of this shit
3369140	3371140	but there was this whole push of like the
3371620	3378700	They used essentially the same trick on an atomic level which was like accusing the left of controlling the media
3378980	3385020	Accusing the media of having a liberal bias and people who go into journalism are number one
3385740	3388380	Typically probably in their personal lives
3389060	3396540	Probably big fans of freedom of speech probably big fans of of approaching things practically probably big fans of like like
3396780	3401460	Society, but did generally you know as much as they would deny it and not want it to be a thing
3401460	3408500	It's probably true that if you major in journalism in college is an increased chance of your personal politics being liberal, however
3409580	3415060	Like you use also an increased chance of you having a fucking huge power to like put that aside
3415500	3422180	Probably too much so and it was exploited throughout our history the right has that strategy they they drill down on it
3422180	3429100	they know that they can accuse the left of being unfair and the left will hear the word unfair and just freeze like a
3429100	3431700	Rabbit and then they'll just do whatever they want
3431700	3436300	Like while everyone's frozen because it's like you just call time out on the game of duck duck goose
3436300	3438300	And then you just say you're a goose. I don't know
3440020	3442820	All right politics corners over but but yeah, I
3446460	3448460	Don't know what to talk about
3449260	3454980	Warts doesn't I don't have anal. Sorry Spencer. What do you let's talk about anal work? No, no
3454980	3459700	No, doesn't Joel McHale own a steakhouse? I was gonna ask that way. Yeah, he does downtown
3459700	3462060	We think with the Russo with the Russo brothers. Yeah
3462740	3464740	What's the deal with that?
3464820	3468900	You should eat in a steakhouse. The Russo brothers are clearly sending me a message message received
3468900	3471900	I'm sorry that I wasn't more respectful. I should have taken some though
3472500	3477220	They they tease the shit out of all those comic-con fans with that
3477940	3479820	That Troy and obit clip, huh?
3479820	3484260	That really when I saw the people were like community movie and when I saw the actual clip
3484260	3489420	I was like that's not what that portends. You're just no. Yeah, you're just believing what you want to be there
3489580	3495340	It was good clickbait and then I was right, but I'm always right cuz I'm a genius and no one can make me not smart
3495860	3498900	But I used to have to say it when it was like what about the community movie?
3498900	3501060	Thank you for I would be like, oh Justin Lynn
3501060	3504700	I'll get the community movie made cuz he's got this huge deal and he's like the fast furious guy
3504700	3508780	I mean now it's like whoa, that's good. The Russo brothers being
3510180	3513060	Bored and successful is the greatest thing that can happen
3513900	3518740	Is there any theme to the is his name on it? Is he like Mike Ditka in Chicago?
3518740	3524140	Where he yes, yeah, you'll make a sweet steak. No, it's I don't know. They've a they've a class
3524980	3527180	Well, it's supposed to be very good. There is the soup. I
3528260	3530260	am
3530620	3534340	I am I am no foodie at all, but that was dope
3534780	3538260	I did the place that I ate at with McKenna McHale
3540380	3544060	That it is it was goddamn amazing
3544060	3548260	It's a Hollywood and vine over there a little hard to find in GPS
3548580	3553580	It's across the street from the panty it's called APL. Is that everything? That's right. Oh, yeah, what'd you get?
3554340	3559660	Thick cut bacon. Sorry Rob Schwab like but I mean it's a steak place
3559660	3563260	Yeah, but it's like super like if you want to
3565060	3567060	Judge
3567220	3573980	She-she foodie culture great place to walk into take a photo and like put on your blog and go look at this fucking shit
3575060	3580180	But if you want to have delicious food and or like like take a date and impress the hell out of them
3580180	3582180	It is a fantastic
3582220	3584740	place like so over the top like I
3586060	3590220	The steak knives look like throwing knives. They're made of one piece of metal
3590300	3595940	Yeah, and I was like, I thought I was just there an integral handle or a through tank
3597700	3600540	I've been watching a lot of forged fire fire. Yeah
3601540	3604180	This blade will key will kill
3605700	3608500	Market every time I see him go it will key
3610700	3611500	I
3611500	3616500	Giggle and I kind of pee my pants a tiny but and then if I go into an airport and you see keels
3616540	3618700	Like the store like that has lotions and whatnot
3618700	3624140	I have to take a picture of it and send it to people go this store will key
3624340	3631700	So I I was taking a you haven't watched fortune fire. It's like chopped but chopped took their name because the fortune fire
3632300	3636740	Hadn't come after child a lot more chopping and forged in fire. Absolutely
3636740	3641020	Yeah, and the contestants are nicer and help each other. They do and everyone likes each other
3641020	3642860	They all look after each other sportsmanship
3642860	3647860	Fortune fire is just the fucking greatest. They have to make a sword later on and doesn't mean anything. It's great
3648540	3653700	It doesn't you're talking about checking out and not wanting to watch politics and not wanting to turn on the news
3653700	3658980	Yeah, just fortune fire. Just watching people just hammer metal and go. This is all I want
3658980	3660980	I have Asperger's I want to make a sword
3662580	3667140	And then to buffer that urge I recommend 35 milligrams of hoarders
3667980	3673740	Hoarders gives me anxiety because I man yeah, but a y'all better cry to shark tank like I do
3675300	3678260	Shark tank I cry to shark tank
3678260	3683620	I have not going to lie because you bring your child on people bring their whole families on a shark tank and be like
3683860	3687980	Before I pitch you this thing that takes tops off of cans. I
3689140	3692180	Have battled leg cancer for 14 months
3692340	3696760	And then fucking this was the invention that they came up with when they were in the hospital
3696820	3700300	They just offer and like they just ask it for 20 grand pass. Oh
3706780	3710420	We could talk about reality TV for the rest of the night just got to tell you about these steak knives
3710420	3714940	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, believe me. All I want to know is more about the last thing. I'm gonna be
3715860	3723080	Where the steak knives they're non-serrated but so sharp that their steak knives and I like took a picture of
3723300	3728500	Were they etched or the Damascus where they were you guys? Oh, I don't know. I don't know you have to go there
3728500	3732020	But there's nothing you can eat there. Huh? No, I'm gonna just look at the knives
3735180	3737180	Okay, they're I'm gonna take a knife and bring my own
3737700	3743700	Ballistics dummy in there and do a fucking bunch of kill tests and because McHale knows the people there like I was caught
3743700	3745700	I was like these knives are amazing. He's like, huh?
3746100	3750400	Ask the people about him. Whatever fucking giant bicep the size of a watermelon
3752580	3754960	They have the 1051 steel, what do you got the
3756100	3762140	260 but there I believe they said the steak knives cost six thousand dollars each to make
3762540	3768700	Yeah, they charge you if you take like they call the police right if you put one in your purse and leave and yes
3768700	3770700	I've been playing that only women steal
3771100	3775340	You're welcome because you know what?
3777460	3779940	Then it's time to even those scales then
3781420	3784900	That joke he just said well keel your career
3786100	3790260	But but they tell you obviously if you I mean people are very tempted. I was tempted
3790260	3791620	I was like I want these fucking knives
3791620	3797040	I was gonna I wanted to ask them about it because I wanted to order them on Amazon or whatever foolish me these fuckers are
3797040	3802440	custom made by a dwarf in the volcanic planet of his face Gia and
3803160	3807560	There I think they said they're six grand each which makes sense because they were like they're like
3807560	3809600	So like do you have problems with people there?
3809600	3815200	I get the numbers mixed up because they might have also said there's only 600 of them in existence
3815200	3817560	Yeah, and I and that they're worth something else
3817560	3823960	But sometimes people steal them and they simply call the police and get the knife back because it's grand larceny
3824920	3826920	They sell them like if you really want them
3826920	3830940	I think they'll sell you this all to you at like full price and then they'll only have
3831360	3837680	599 of them well yeah wait you're acting like you know what that's what I read in like they you know
3837680	3843280	They they have like press and stuff about the places I eat. I am a big food lover guy
3843440	3848580	This guy started doing a food Instagram, and then I stopped cuz I got shame that I gained weight back
3848960	3850960	but stop posting about
3851080	3852520	once I get
3852560	3857880	Once the house is furnished and ready like I I want to throw knives again
3857880	3861840	I'm gonna be a knife thrower again damn. I was I was doing why don't you?
3862360	3866560	You got the money you got the space for it for sure let's build a backyard forge
3866560	3870400	And let's get on fucking foraging fire for weapons. Yes
3871160	3875960	In the backyard. I watch for I look I'm pretty sure if you give me a fucking coal forage
3875960	3881100	I'll fucking lay it down right now. I don't know man. You got to keep that heat up, but you got to keep the heat
3881100	3885820	Right you got to keep it even you got to you got to watch that quench cuz it'll warp on you and a water
3885820	3887700	If you don't I'm gonna throw you in I'm gonna throw you in there
3887700	3893380	Don't you ever water quench never water quench water. You got to put it in the oil. What about the burned tang?
3893380	3898220	What is that they don't burning it through the wood ever do a idea never do a burn through
3898220	3902420	I mean you can do that if you got loads of time, but not in a two-hour ever works out because this round of
3902420	3904420	Forging is over. Thank you
3905020	3907180	The guy's name is will Willis, and I love him
3907180	3910300	And I want to fucking hug everybody on that show can I tell you about the episode of hoarders?
3910300	3915620	We watched the other night on the recommendation of a hoarder's addict who's for ten seasons
3915620	3921100	It's like they texted somebody and they gave us the top four Hulu recommendations like number one was like this
3922060	3924420	So much poop and pee being stored
3925140	3929980	This they store the poop and the pee yeah, and I think I was like they said do you have a problem poop and pee?
3929980	3931020	I was like fuck no
3931020	3935380	I've seen a million hoarders where there's like oh, there's poop on your story cares. What sort of vessels do this?
3935900	3938280	Fuck I literally almost be it's like a guy
3938280	3943620	I'm getting watching it cuz it's like full-blown, but I just it's like the court the poop
3944020	3949580	It was a it was it was it was a woman who had it's what there's always a tragic story to it
3949580	3953700	And there was a woman who had lived with her mom or mom when she moved in with her her mom was a hoarder
3953700	3956540	And her mom was kind of like it
3957380	3962820	Whatever. I'm not gonna like he ran out of poop one day. There was a she never forgot it. There's always there's always a
3963540	3965540	There's always this crazy make-or-break mom
3966620	3973820	Where the person is he has to like they have to like they it's make-or-break like they're either willing to like
3974620	3980180	They just they kind of like they'll come but they'll come up with some thing and like this woman
3980340	3983160	Was like because they kept saying to her like you know
3983740	3987260	You know there's poop and pee everywhere here, and she's like yeah
3987260	3992660	I know it's but it's also it's like musty and they're like no musty is like a thing you say when
3992980	3997260	There's not poop and pee everywhere, but it still smells as they're like is it in mason jars
3997260	3999260	Or what's going it was like it was like these these
3999620	4005120	Water jugs, so it was like it was like I guess just even exchange if like you get water from
4005460	4011380	Albertsons and you drink it and then you pee and poop and whatever's left of those just it was it was voluminous
4011380	4015380	It was crazy. It was just like piles of these individual canisters
4015460	4020780	But though they kept they kept warning her they're like like like this is this is septic
4020860	4022860	conditions, and you can't know this stuff and like
4023220	4029180	usually you expect the person to be in denial about the danger of the conditions and she was in denial about that and then they
4029180	4033180	Started the cleaning process and then after and then there was like the chiron that said
4034380	4039060	Four days into the cleaning process like whatever her name is she has a meeting with the people in the backyard
4039060	4043700	And she goes like look guys like all I'm telling you is I get it
4043780	4046340	You're cleaning out the whole house everything's gonna
4046340	4051500	Go, and I'm just telling you like you keep throwing away all this food that I have because you're telling me like it
4051500	4053860	Probably has poop in it, and I'm just telling you
4054260	4059700	I'm like I need to I need to eat something from that house
4059700	4062900	she eats the poop and they were like saying to her like what are you saying that you're like a
4064140	4071060	Junkie and that you you need one final blaze of glory before the intervention like you want to eat potentially
4071180	4074340	Contaminated and she was just sort of like saying yeah, that's that's what it is
4074340	4078660	I want to eat food that might have shit in it like she was it was almost heroic like
4079580	4081940	That's not that's not any hero
4081940	4087140	I've ever worshiped well it is when you get to the point where you're like you're like clinging to anything that you're willing to
4087140	4089340	Fuck in ladies want a little nibble. I
4090260	4094980	Find hoarders fascinating because I wish you would hate that she poops in the food or the food
4094980	4098180	Oh, she's got shit everywhere, and then there's people like you're like telling her
4098740	4104220	It seems like the latter seasons of hoarders what they've done now is they've they didn't want to lose viewers who tune in
4104220	4110380	For the bullying which I don't like I don't like watching people come into a hoarder's place and go like holy shit
4110380	4117020	it's like what the fuck job did you sign up for you asshole like I I like that I like that like the
4117340	4119340	like the people that are like
4119340	4125900	Clinically trained and like they come in the door. They go okay all right, so what's going on with the mouse skeletons. You know like
4126860	4130340	Valuable to you yeah, yeah, no I got to keep those otherwise you never know like
4130500	4134700	And it's like these people are obviously in need of help, but if you want to help them
4134700	4139700	I just I kind of fetishize that like I like to judge the judges
4139700	4145940	I'm like and but now what they've done in the latter seasons of hoarders now is they've broken it into this like ghost hunters kind
4145940	4147940	Of a story b story where like they'll have
4148420	4150420	extreme cleaning experts
4150460	4158100	Spend the night in the house, and so they do night vision like Blair Witch stuff like there's a turd next to me. Holy shit
4159100	4165260	I've never cleaned anything this extreme this old lady's soul has been crushed
4167180	4171380	But but they're like cutting back and forth between that and the people that I like it's like I like
4172300	4178180	I'm inspired by the idea that you know like I have I have relations to
4178380	4182660	That breed of dysfunction like I but for the grace of God
4183140	4187180	You know have a place that you can see the floor in
4187820	4191220	and I've been in places where it's like I just I'm
4191620	4197820	endlessly fascinated by the ways that you can be in pain and crazy and the different definitions between
4198100	4203100	total compulsion that you can pull out of and how you pull those people out of it and stuff and I I
4203380	4210380	Like like and for me personally as a guy who was teased a lot for hygiene and stuff like that. I I find it tremendously
4211500	4212660	I go to that
4212820	4214140	I like going to that well
4214140	4218900	And I've really never met anybody that wanted to watch hoarders as much as I do so I just never get to see it
4218900	4224660	That much and I understand no one wanting to watch it, but I'm like I love that. I love watching
4225700	4227700	kind people who are like
4228500	4230500	have degrees in
4231260	4237180	the amount of pain you have to have in order to get this bad and who and watching them like
4237540	4244140	Just just be chill about it and try to reach the person and then watching the person confront their wall
4244460	4251420	Like I've watched a few and I couldn't really like keep going because I think I saw a few where the person
4251940	4254420	felt tortured by having the
4255300	4260740	Clutter removed and it was like it was hurtful for them because they're losing
4260740	4265420	Yeah, a stack of newspapers are never gonna look at covered in rat droppings, but like
4266380	4269580	Losing that was like having something ripped out of them. Yeah
4270140	4274180	It's really I mean I said, you know, it's it that's why it's riveting to me because the outcome isn't always the same
4274180	4276180	it's like it's it's
4276820	4277940	Sometimes it's like, okay
4277940	4284660	We got it you you shit and peed in your house so much that it would cost more to clean it than to tear it
4284660	4289340	Down your worst nightmare has arrived. Like we don't even want to like sort through it. Goodbye
4289340	4294780	You're going you you're gonna live with your aunt Stephanie now. I thought you were gonna talk about poop mountain
4295500	4301500	The the hoarders of you don't the poop mountain that's that's why I started gagging that that's probably the episode I'm talking about
4301500	4303500	No, there's there was a toilet
4304020	4306020	That had poop. Oh
4306460	4310980	Up to there. They were storing it. They decided to stop flushing it. They were storing it
4310980	4315060	They were still they just and I've that's what I don't watch the show cuz I have a gag reflex
4315060	4321180	Yeah, and they were they just left the poop in the toilet and it just kept growing and it and there's a picture online
4321180	4323180	Just look up hoarders poop. No
4323660	4325660	Yeah, I'm not
4326140	4330780	Literally is a hoarder of poop. There's a cousin of the show
4330780	4336060	there's an episode of hoarders that I saw a long time ago where the person had like cats in the basement and cages and
4336700	4339420	And I was like the animal ones fucking me. I can't handle this
4339420	4342460	But apparently there's a and I can't judge these people because what do I like?
4342460	4348540	But like apparently there's a huge audience of people that are like more of the animals and there's like a whole animal hoarders show
4348620	4354540	Or it's just like mainlining that drug like they need people who have a kid who's who's dark
4354940	4358060	like like like you know because because they're they're
4358780	4362140	Identifying with the hoarder of all those cats. I don't know. I don't know and it's hard
4362140	4365260	I'd be hard-pressed to tell you what I'm doing watching it
4365260	4370860	You know how much of it is me punching down and how much of it is me, you know, cuz you're an old place like your old
4371420	4376460	Wilcox place you weren't a hoarder. You were just messy and I wasn't I was a fucked up enough guy
4377100	4379740	That you know if the neighbor had a plumbing problem
4380220	4380940	I you know
4380940	4385260	I remember the shame of somebody knocking on my door and being like fuck well
4385260	4391900	Who's this like, you know and like just calling through the people because they can't come in here. They're gonna call something
4391980	4397900	They're gonna call the city. I remember like a they're gonna they're gonna call mountain dew and domino's pizza and say this guy
4397900	4399580	Should be working for you
4399580	4402220	I remember I remember like a plumber coming in because someone in the
4402300	4407340	neighboring apartment had something wrong with their plumbing and they needed to come to my place and look at my pipes and I had like
4407980	4409660	like not actual shit
4409660	4413020	But shit in the sink like cardboard just garbage in the sink
4413020	4417660	Like the sink was just full of like just like not even just dirty dishes
4417660	4421500	But just like I wasn't even allowed to go in hard board and shit like in my sink
4421500	4424940	And like I remember the sound of the plumber just going what the fuck
4426060	4430140	and it's like I it's yeah, it's like that's part of what's interesting to me is like
4431100	4437740	It like well, I kept doing it like I you've got the opposite direction now you have this this expansive
4437740	4441260	Well because because because palace because whatever is wrong with me
4441580	4447500	I'm graced with a circuit board that had an output port on it that that that connects to a money machine
4447900	4452300	I and I think that's part of it too is my guilt like why i'm fascinated with the
4452760	4458380	Neurodiverse community is because I feel a little guilty sometimes of like, well, why did I get a fucking?
4459020	4462140	uh, just like scratch off ticket that's like
4463100	4469740	when you when you're gross you you you don't have to work for a living and everyone like one
4470440	4476940	Micron to the side of me or one lithium drip different from me is like I have to live under a bridge and the
4477260	4482220	Police are gonna shoot me like and I'm like, like yeah, i'm kind of like, you know
4482860	4487900	I just like it's just morbid fascination. I guess like I maybe i'm looking for
4488380	4490780	Maybe I want to know that they also make bad choices
4491900	4497420	Like all right. Yeah, but you you you you yeah, I don't know the bad choice was storing the poop
4498380	4502620	Definitely. It's like I don't think if I could if I could if I if I didn't get to a if I didn't if I didn't
4502620	4508940	Get to a level while I was knee-deep in pizza boxes and and and and pantyhose and fucking shit
4509500	4510780	uh, like
4510780	4512380	Because there was a room in your place
4512380	4516140	So you weren't ashamed to let me or rob into your apartment
4516460	4521580	But I was not allowed to go into the bedroom because that that door was always that's where the mannequin legs were and like yeah
4521740	4528380	like and Jeffrey Dahmer famously before he started eating people like saw a mannequin in a window then he then he like
4529340	4534700	hid all night in a store so he could steal the mannequin because he was like thinking to himself like if only if I had a
4534700	4538700	Mannequin, maybe I won't have to hurt people and like it was like an open joke with you guys
4538700	4542780	It was like this looks like a serial killer's lair and i'm like, yeah, i'm always thinking about that stuff
4542780	4549260	I'm like, oh jeez, what separates me on this family tree of of of monsters and maybe that's why i'm a you know
4549260	4553100	I need to prison advocacy and stuff. Not that I do anything about it, but i'm like
4555420	4559260	How do we how do we treat our worst people like that that that documentary?
4559900	4564940	But the the pervert park or whatever where it's like every single person in there was abused as a child and other
4565580	4568860	you know anyways, but the the the
4569340	4574460	Um for the by the grace of fucking chaos by the random throws of dice
4575180	4576620	like
4576620	4582940	My being knee deep in all this garbage and hating myself and being ready to like whatever like
4583980	4588940	It resulted in me being able to get in a bigger apartment and then and then hire a housekeeper
4589660	4592060	And so then I had a person coming over every week
4592140	4596540	Like you you get to a point where you can afford to hire someone that comes over every week
4596700	4599900	They do your laundry. They wash your dishes. They want they
4600460	4604780	Swiffer your floor like you're you're done. You can be as much a pig as you want
4604860	4608620	And that's like it's like a video game. It's as good when you get that upgrade and you're fucking done
4608620	4615260	Like i'm not tested anymore about what kind of filth I would live in if it was up to me to clean up after myself
4616380	4618940	Uh, yeah more than opportunity
4619740	4623180	What's that? You are hoarding opportunity and hoarding opportunity. Yes
4623260	4626620	No, this is not me trying to shame you because like I you and I
4627180	4630940	Spend a lot of time in hotels. No one that's ever not shamed anybody started a sentence that way, but
4634460	4639660	JFK never famously came out to announce the space program. I'm not trying to shame the country
4640460	4642540	However, we should go to the moon
4644700	4646700	JFK was davros
4647740	4652300	Sounded like davros. Yeah, uh, I was shaming your impression. It was a good enough
4652300	4658140	No, but like when I stayed hotel like I like I unpacked my suitcase and when I leave
4658780	4660780	I I cleaned the hotel
4661340	4663340	Almost completely before I leave
4664060	4670780	But i've seen you check into hotel and instantly there's just debris everywhere like oh your suitcase explodes into a
4671400	4673900	Cataclysm of underpants and socks and shoes
4674780	4676780	and like something like like I
4676780	4681180	I don't know if you're going back to when me and mcgathy were together or if that's because I am solo like that
4681180	4685100	but me and mcgathy were like the key master and gatekeeper of
4686220	4689500	We would just somehow just we both were like this party
4691340	4694780	We would check into a hotel in scotland and we had just got there
4695180	4700300	And I would knock on your door and I come in and there was just there was not a single bit of floor that was not
4700780	4705020	Covered in suitcase material like whatever you had packed. It was just everywhere
4705020	4707900	Like I don't know how you like how yeah how you got there that quickly
4708300	4712060	It looked like yeah, you were sitting nancy, but just in a hurry. Yeah
4712700	4714700	Just sitting nancy, but in a hurry
4717020	4719100	I mean I for my yeah, it's like what I
4719740	4720860	Well, you're alone in a hotel
4720860	4724940	I mean do you like if you ever check into a hotel alone is it same way or if i'm in a hotel alone?
4725020	4729900	I throw my duffel bag down if you know i'm i'm like like i'm on a
4730460	4732540	I'm on a journey into darkness if i'm alone
4732940	4737500	Like so so i'll put i'm actually ironically probably a lot cleaner because i'll just put the bag down
4737740	4738700	and I
4738700	4740700	There's been trips where i'm like I
4740780	4743820	I'm like, oh three days in new york time to head back to l.a. Oh
4744460	4746460	I guess I never unzipped this bag
4747180	4751980	Just kind of just wore the same. Yeah, just just flying home with my that's how I got shingles
4755100	4757100	Pretty sure just like
4757340	4760780	Didn't sleep that much never like the bed spreads perfectly clean
4760860	4766060	You could bounce a quarter off it because I slept half on the floor with my head wedged behind the alarm clock
4768380	4770380	Yeah
4770460	4772460	I like new york
4773740	4776380	There's a drawing room on every corner yeah
4777420	4779900	I could live in a hotel. I I love the idea that
4780780	4783100	I if i'm staying at a hotel for three days say
4783580	4787580	I will put the do not disturb on the whole time because I don't really make that much of a mess
4787580	4789580	I don't need new new towels every moment
4789900	4793740	Like I could use the same towel for three days and it'll be all right. I can sleep in the same bed
4794220	4799500	Um, i'm the same way. Yeah, but uh, I I do like the idea that if you're if
4799820	4802700	In the event that i've ever had to stay at a hotel for like a couple weeks
4803340	4805340	The idea that you can
4805340	4809900	Take that do not disturb thing off go out and have lunch and come back and you're in a brand new place
4810460	4813340	I love that that timing has never worked out for me ever
4813820	4816220	Right. I'm never leaving as I like, yeah
4816460	4821340	Yeah, i've never like I call him I or if I walk down to the lobby I say hey, can you have someone come up?
4821340	4825420	I'm going to be out for an hour and a half. Can you have someone come and uh, do the do? Yeah
4826060	4828060	Feels pretentious to me
4829340	4835740	Well then tip them I do okay, I make a big mess with 20 dollar bills I leave them all over the place
4840540	4844880	There's your new hoarders episode it's like a big rich monster exploded
4845120	4847120	You did
4847120	4852240	The best is canada because the moment you get to canada you instantly have four pounds of coins in your pocket
4852560	4854560	Because they love metal money there
4854560	4858400	And uh, I think the housekeepers there must just love it because you're just like oh
4858640	4863520	Fuck all this shit. And there's like 30 dollars of coins on the level. I found like 10 tunis
4863760	4867840	I love the yeah tunis lennies. You got the whole thing. All right, it's time for our next segment
4867840	4869840	We're trying to run a tight ship here
4870880	4873440	So that's 9 30 it's time for
4875280	4877280	Uh
4878640	4880640	Make it count make it count

4930240	4933540	And I should be allowed to fight in the armed services
4934880	4938100	Because i'm probably a really good soldier
4939040	4944240	If i'm capable of patriotism in a country that does nothing but judge me
4944320	4948880	You should fucking let me polish your torpedo and sort your bullets

4995280	5000560	I think that'll be the announcement. I don't even know they told me I can't fucking remember. Yeah, I think it's 9 a.m
5000640	5003680	Pacific tomorrow. It's a really good season. You know what that time is eastern
5004720	5006400	12
5006400	5008400	Yeah, I know it's a great season
5008400	5014640	I've seen the animatics not not even all of them, but it's like amazing like just the the the team
5015360	5017360	You know, it's just a testament to
5018400	5023120	You get that rare opportunity to keep a team on board and the same people have to do the same thing
5023520	5025840	Again, and they get to improve in their own ways
5026160	5029600	Like like and it's just the it's just streamlined and amazing
5029760	5030480	Yeah
5030480	5035520	When I bumped into like when I go to starburns and I bumped into like dominic or some of the animators and whatever
5035600	5038160	They're all just like they have a giant smile on their face
5038160	5043360	Which it doesn't seem like they're going into the coal mines to go do a hard job. They're really happy about it
5043440	5047600	That's what makes me feel good as it generally does seem like people are excited about the show
5047600	5052560	They like the show and they like working on it. Like, uh, you know, I've never really made a show
5053280	5059600	Outside harm a quest so I don't I don't know if that's normal or not normal, but it definitely feels uh, you know cool
5059920	5062000	it's extraordinary, uh
5062000	5064000	my fiance
5064560	5066400	although she was a
5066400	5071280	You know, she she had a show before but she was working with the partners and she just finished wrapping her
5071760	5074080	10 episode thing for quibi and it was
5075100	5077600	remarkable going to the wrap party and uh
5077600	5082960	I've seen the same thing with your leadership that people are just so grateful to have clarity and vision at the top and
5083680	5087920	You know cody will sometimes say to me like well, you've done this more than me
5088560	5091120	What do you think and i'll go? No, we're not
5092080	5094080	All i've done more than you is
5094560	5099680	What you've done, but so differently that we're not I don't have more experience than you anymore
5100080	5101760	like like
5101760	5103760	i've watched cody
5104560	5111440	Confront certain situations politically creatively where it's like you're in post and then somebody's like they've got notes
5111440	5117440	And someone else has got notes and the way that people handle things and stuff and like my only experience is in this sort of like
5118000	5122080	I don't know this kind of thing where i'm like like, yeah, you know, I gotta nip that in the bud
5122080	5125760	I'm gonna have to tell ralph that he's not allowed to be in the edit bay anymore
5125840	5129280	This is this very like like cut and dry like, you know
5129840	5134240	Not to be too hyperbolic, but there's almost mafioso kind of thing where it's like
5134800	5140160	We're at war and this is an army the war is with lack of entertainment and we're an army and i'm the general
5140160	5145600	It's not i've come to learn all too late that it is. That is not the right way to
5146160	5147840	Get things done
5147840	5149840	There's way more
5150640	5154480	Like being a hub of a wheel where you actually are
5155040	5157920	Dealing with more shit, not less shit. You're not
5158780	5164240	MacArthur at the top like someone can be turned into dust for questioning where you park your tank
5164720	5171520	It's like you're in the middle of it getting paid the most and so there's a bunch of people like worrying about shit
5171600	5173600	And you radiate outward
5173680	5175920	Uh calm and leadership and stuff like that
5176000	5178000	I've seen cody do it and seen you do it
5178000	5180720	And see the difference in how the production goes and it
5180880	5185840	Translates into dollars and cents being saved and you should be very proud of yourself. You're a great showrunner
5186720	5187760	it
5187760	5189200	It's a
5189200	5194960	It's a real skill. It's not a it's it's it's it's it's something that just you're just good at it
5195040	5198000	I was I was very lucky david our line producer is very good
5198080	5204160	And also we have dominick who jeff mentioned he's like this big time guy from simpsons and king of the hill and stuff
5204240	5207920	So we had a lot of great people rick and i went out and uh, like
5208640	5213360	Was doing like came over to starburns for a meeting or something like that or doing some other podcast thing and
5214240	5215680	some of your
5215680	5221200	I won't say employees but like you know, some of your you know, your crew and like animators and directors and whatnot
5221680	5223840	They they looked over and they're like hey
5224480	5226480	Like the guy from the tv
5226480	5228000	They're like like
5228000	5234080	I forget her name. I forget one of the animators. She's she's like or maybe she's an editor, but she's like like roji
5234560	5237520	I I won't remember i'm sorry, but uh i'm bad with names
5237600	5242160	But she she was like she looked like she couldn't have been happier to be on the job on that thing
5242720	5245680	So that has to that has to be a trickle-down thing from
5246240	5250880	The top of people like liking to show up for work and being proud of what they're creating
5251360	5256640	Yeah, it's really cool. This season. We got who we got. We got matt gourley. We got kate makuchi
5256720	5262880	We got tony newson. We got reggie. Watts. We got joel kim booster. We got jared logan. We got darcy carton
5262960	5269200	We got jess mckenna. We got uh carl tar and we got tom kenny and they all really nail it
5269840	5274720	Jess mckenna's episode. She was she the one that did like the legal thing. Yeah, it was like a legal
5274800	5277040	Yeah, I mean without doing a spoiler. I don't know how much I can spoil
5277040	5282480	But there was a thing that I think was accidental that she happened there happened to be a a legal
5283040	5286480	Like a courtroom scene and I don't think that that was by design, right?
5286480	5292320	But she no we wanted to get matt gourley because he obviously did a great skeleton lawyer on harmontown
5292640	5296000	Right, but he couldn't make it for that episode. We got jess mckenna who is in
5296240	5301520	She apparently like went to law school and it was one of the most good laws. She was like a mock courtroom
5302080	5308000	In high school. Yeah, it was devastating improv. I was like like what the fuck like, how did you it was a tour de force?
5308080	5314080	It really was like it was I just saw her recently and like that was outstanding. She's great. Her podcast is great. Holy shit
5314240	5317520	Yeah, it's it's a goodie. And then tom kenny, of course is just a
5318560	5319760	He's his own
5319760	5322080	Yeah, it's great. He he's I don't know
5322400	5328960	It really feels like it escalates like towards the end and he really he's screaming in the end of the episode and it's like man
5328960	5334000	What a great way to finish off this. Have you seen his band tom kenny in the high seas? No, is anybody?
5334960	5336400	Yeah, it's
5336400	5338400	I think he he sings
5338640	5343200	Like a soul singer like he's like odus redding or sam cook and he he has a giant band
5343440	5349200	There's three women backup vocalists. They're great. There's a bunch of horns. They all have captain's hats on and
5349920	5353120	He just screams for a living and never loses his voice
5353200	5358240	Like he like spongebob doing soul music is very exciting at the end of hollywood's life
5358320	5362240	Tom kenny's gonna be standing outside the gates as the rest of it burns down behind him and he's gonna be like
5362320	5364000	I guess I won. Yeah
5364000	5366000	All right. He he's such an odd
5366880	5369280	character on the chessboard of la
5370320	5374400	We were having dinner. I just ran into him and him and jill talia's wife was awesome also and like
5374800	5377200	Just like sitting next to them. It's just like he
5378080	5382880	He has this ability to really make you happy and I like it's it doesn't seem like a put-on
5382960	5385840	He's just he just has childlike glee at all
5385840	5389760	He's definitely one of those guys that you'd have every opportunity to like second guess his
5390160	5393120	Glow and go like well that must come at the cost of being
5393680	5399680	Uh disingenuous somehow or like you're you're so on. I don't think he's ever been on this show, has he we should bring
5399920	5401920	We should bring tom and jill on
5401920	5403920	And while i'm thinking of it leavey
5404720	5406720	Uh
5407280	5408960	He takes out his phone
5408960	5412320	But you're not too busy with your vampire girlfriend who can't take a photograph
5412960	5416640	Andy kindler we got the we got the kindles back who kind of thought we got
5417120	5422880	The the andy kindler and uh and tom kenny on in in in respect to some religion
5423040	5427520	Like are the are the gandalf and saruman of I like kindler so
5428240	5432640	He's so he goes so dark. Yeah, god damn. He's funny. But anyways
5432720	5435040	Also, we got we got dave foley. He wants to be on the show, too
5435680	5437440	Yeah, it's good to see him again
5437440	5444400	I I saw I saw mark mckinney in san diego and he was there with his fully adult son. It was it's so weird to like look at like
5445360	5448800	colleagues people the people that you admired when you were a kid and then you're like
5449920	5451920	mckinney and I are both the same
5453420	5458000	Puffiness we're the same age, you know, like we I I I really like
5458720	5461840	like hanging out with that guy and he's a delight and like i've
5462320	5463520	uh
5463520	5470320	Ran into him in san diego and then and then went to see tom kenny at the farmer's market and scott thompson's walking
5470320	5472560	Scott thompson is sitting there with dave foley over there
5472960	5479280	I guess it's like the we did a show on winnipeg with uh foley and uh, you know the who's live anyway thing and that's where
5480000	5482320	Kevin mcdonald lives kevin came to the show
5482320	5485680	We brought him on stage and I sat in the green with with him and I
5486320	5491440	Just hugged him and he instantly just hugs you back. He's like he's everything you want out of kevin mcdonald
5491520	5493520	He's just a little love bug
5493520	5495200	It's really good
5495200	5497200	There's only they all used to hate each other
5497200	5503520	Uh, but like I think they hated each other the canadian they they they maybe like they didn't share a bus one time
5503600	5508720	Well, I think I I think I think some of them got along with some of them hate each other. Well, they've lived a
5509440	5513840	Whatever like like like they they they all definitely like each other now
5513840	5517200	It's fun going down like like being atlanta with uh, dave foley and he's sober now
5517200	5522640	And he's been sober for like I think like seven eight years. Um, and he goes. Oh, yeah, I was arrested there. I uh,
5523440	5528560	I I passed out there was arrested like like like like you like you get the dave foley kind of remembering where he was
5528560	5530720	Been in the world before tour. It's great
5532720	5534720	Thank you, sir that guy loves it
5535040	5537040	I will say it's like like
5537440	5538960	dave and
5538960	5540080	scott
5540080	5545520	are like like when you look at their faces, I don't know if scott thompson like drinks a lot but like
5546480	5551520	That face app thing that was going around where it's like all it does is just like, you know
5551520	5557120	It doesn't like either those guys both they just it's like, okay clearly you're older put at the same time
5557120	5561600	Like it's not none of the bad things. It's simply just adding like lines of distinction
5561680	5566080	Yeah, but there's the same shape face. They still have a weird kind of childlike
5566880	5570000	Cherubic kind of thing going on. It's yeah, they're aging the way we'd all
5570640	5573920	That's I think if but that's not important also your body's not important
5574640	5576640	I heard that app was the russians
5576960	5578240	Yeah
5578240	5583760	Shout out to all you people as I share my i'm like, oh here's a pic of me or a video of me diving into my pool
5584640	5585440	uh
5585440	5588640	Thank you so much everybody for your constructive criticism about my body
5589040	5594800	from the people that think I skip leg day to the people that think that my legs are great and I need to
5595760	5600000	Uh work on my upper body to the people that just want to say I look like a caramel apple
5601840	5605520	A ton a ton of people just being like fucking awesome
5605520	5608960	And just going like like like I don't want to say what you should say
5609120	5613840	But what I would say to you if I was your if I was following you and you were like
5614000	5618880	Here's me jumping in a pool and I had anything to say i'm pretty sure I would either say a
5619440	5624160	You look fucking great. Like I love you or I'd shut the fuck up
5625520	5630560	Um, I just think it's a but I I I think it's amazing like all the people that are like, dude
5630640	5635840	You need to fucking work on your thighs and your legs. So instead of like you click on every single one of their names
5635920	5637920	Not that i've done this
5638400	5642160	Always a locked account always because they're so proud of physical
5642720	5647920	Like like like beauty and they they're so focused on it that they love their life and they can't wait to celebrate
5648560	5653760	The shape of their body and they they just that's why they have a locked account and they just go and comment
5654080	5656720	Other people's pages your legs are too skinny
5658080	5659760	You know what?
5659760	5666720	Every bit of carbon dioxide that you exhale turns into fucking oxygen through me. I'm a plant apparently
5669120	5673280	Or a drunk mammal that's run out of things to say you actually might be a caramel apple, uh
5675760	5678880	I may be a caramel apple. Look I did notice it too. I do look a little
5679840	5681360	It's a little odd
5681360	5684960	I think it might be a little bit of field of view thing like I definitely like
5685680	5688640	I'm it's I think it's a combination of not
5689440	5690320	dieting
5690320	5696640	Drinking whenever I want but still working out and like lifting and stuff like that plus just like but surprisingly
5696640	5699040	we were in the pool playing pool sports where we took some of uh,
5699520	5704960	Their dogs like tennis ball like little like chew toys and we were just pitching it around
5705440	5707680	And your hand-eye coordination is fantastic
5707680	5713520	Like you like you're like you got a baseball player's like mitt on your I don't know why playing catch is fun in a pool
5713520	5716160	But if you try to do it on land, it'd be like fuck you bully
5717200	5719920	Because you could fall there's something really fun about it
5719920	5725680	Like yeah, a pool is throwing a ball because if you miss it you get to go swim over to it. It's it's it's exciting
5725680	5728960	It's really good. I'm so sunburned right now. I'm just pink
5729600	5732480	I I like like my upper my upper body is
5733120	5735520	You got it. Sorry caylin. Sorry too soon. Cool
5738080	5740160	Caitlin you're saying 20 minutes and what happens to you?
5740160	5746320	Do you just roast or I get uh, i'm pink right now from 10 minutes of my sunscreen wearing off. Uh under the stage lights
5747760	5751760	I actually got heat rash on my legs from reading calvin and hobs as a kid in my bathroom
5752080	5755920	I didn't realize that there was a heat lamp above me and I was just reading because it was the only place it could
5755920	5759680	Get away from my family who I love and who are all elbino. Yeah
5760160	5763760	Just my brother's just yeah, I realized that something was wrong when I could get heat
5764000	5767040	I could get uh burned from that. Yeah, put on sunscreen
5767120	5772320	So it's not just uv light that gets you it's any kind of every kind of everything sucks convection radiation or anything like that
5772320	5773760	Yeah, i'm not a fan
5773760	5774720	Oh, man
5774720	5780480	Did anybody happen to see the is your news algorithm the same as mine where you get that fox news story about the british girl?
5780560	5783040	That was snorkeling in cuba. I don't know
5783760	5787520	Click at your peril. It's fucking crazy. What happened?
5788320	5794720	How's she doing? Well, it's just she lived there's just a photo of i've never it's it's just a british girl
5794720	5799200	Who's fair skinned who was down in cuba and she swears she put on a million
5799680	5802320	She she knew she was fair skin and put on all the sunscreen
5802320	5808080	So it's like your instinct for victim blaming like kicks in but it's like she's her parents are like i'm telling you
5808160	5810160	I know teenagers don't listen, but
5810480	5816400	We we kept saying put on sunscreen and she kept doing it and she snorkeled for an hour and like
5817520	5822160	Goddamn horror show jeez. I've never I didn't know you just described my worst fears
5822640	5827600	Um, it it look she said it felt she's she was getting on the plane to go back to england
5827600	5832800	And she said it felt like there were water balloons on my back because in fact there were water balloons on her back
5833680	5835680	You you can't imagine it too
5836140	5842720	Extremely like like like like whatever you could conjure in your head. Imagine like you water balloons on a person's back
5844480	5847280	Yeah, devil is alive the devil is alive the devil is alive
5848480	5850480	Uh, but I don't know. I don't understand
5851120	5853120	This poor girl. I mean bless her heart
5853200	5857920	like she's viral because she did have bothered to do a facebook post you'd think like
5858400	5864560	An adolescent girl would be inherently ashamed because something went wrong with the way she looks or whatever and but she's like
5864880	5868240	the reason she's viral and it ends up on fox news is because
5869040	5870320	she was
5870320	5876480	I felt like the the tone of her posts was like she really wanted to make sure this didn't happen to anybody else
5876720	5878720	Like maybe we want to cry a little bit
5879120	5883120	She's been through enough like like and she's just sort of like actually just really be careful
5883600	5887840	Because it's subtext. Is she okay? Like my head is warming up and like there's no
5888160	5892480	I want to follow up. I want to know how she's doing. I I feel a kinship with her. She's okay. She's okay
5892560	5899520	I mean, I mean, she's probably she she may be permanently like whatever she's gonna be permanently anything that like she's healing
5899600	5901840	Okay, okay, but but she's sorry
5902800	5905040	Kaylin, where did you grow up? What's your what's your hometown?
5905040	5906720	I was born here when I was eight
5906720	5911600	I moved to northeast washington right under canada and by idaho so I was pretty because of the cloud cover or
5911760	5914400	Well, we I mean we grew up like it was 92 when we moved
5914400	5918240	So we had those big earthquakes and my parents were kind of like we grew up here and fuck it
5918880	5924000	Um, so everybody else moved up there. So pool parties the beach was always out of the question for you
5924000	5925520	I would just bring my umbrella

5937600	5939120	Yeah, amazing great shows of the gorge
5939120	5944080	But I loved it up there because winters were about six months and it was dark at 4 p.m
5944560	5946800	And everybody else was sad for some reason which I don't understand
5947360	5952160	And uh, it was great and it was a great place to be a goth. I can't wear a velvet in la

5989920	5994720	What are you doing? How do you know him? And then I'm not jealous or anything because if they were lovers once i'd be fine
5994720	5999680	With it. But uh, wow, where are you? Listen, uh, you don't have to wait my cuck
6002480	6006080	I'm so kidding. Um, your wife is so wonderful. It's

6012080	6017040	I love her. She's great. That's what i'm going to say. Um, we worked on a show together called taxi cab confessions
6017760	6021360	And uh, it was a nightmare and we were in south padre and we were drivers
6021600	6027120	So it was a fucking you were driver. I feel like she got my wife and him not me. Yeah, I didn't know. Oh, yeah
6027680	6033040	I didn't drive because I was like, well, i'm just like it's so they hire they're they're not real cab drivers
6033520	6038880	No, they're uh, they're like tv personalities at the time. They were like sort of mtv young sort of hip
6039520	6040720	like
6040720	6047280	Dudes that was the hbo show where they just chirp about their lives. This one was like a sort of a bootleg version of that
6049680	6053760	I think ours was for I think ours was for mtv, but it could have been the hbo one i'll be honest
6054240	6056240	We tried to do a sketch
6056960	6061040	Our vh1 sketch show that channel 101 inspired it was like, uh,
6061600	6065760	Taxi boat confessions or something. Were you were you part of that? Did you shoot?
6066640	6069360	It was just like it was such a waste of money because the joke didn't land
6069440	6070800	But it was like it's just funny
6070800	6074720	this was like people getting into a boat to go across a lake and then the boat's like
6076240	6078400	And and like and there's just a person going like hey
6079040	6082400	Yeah, i'm going across the lake to sleep with a married woman
6083600	6090080	Because they can't you can't hear him over the motor. Sorry, I can't I said i'm i'm engaged in adultery right now
6090960	6095600	And so that's part of the joke and then the other part of the joke is it's just a lake so

6099120	6101120	Okay, we're here
6102080	6104080	You need to resurrect that
