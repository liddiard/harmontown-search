0	16200	Welcome once again, one and all, Matt Mosel and the other guys, from Uptown, Uptown Burbank,
16200	23240	the beautiful part of Uptown Burbank, Harman Town is now in session.
23240	32680	Won't you please join me in welcoming the game master of your dream, Spencer Crittenden.
32680	45040	And the fusciest mayor of all time, you love him, Dan Harman.
45040	53000	Thank you. Thank you very much.
53000	63440	Let's bring this town hall meeting to order. That's the conceit of the show.
63440	71640	First order of business, when did we get to the moon? Remember that premise that never came to
71640	80840	fruition? Well you mean we didn't build a rocket ship? I feel like now isn't that more important
80840	91080	than ever to get the hell off of this horrible planet that wants to kill us? Yeah, but in order
91080	98240	to do it we'd have to work with hundreds of people that I now don't like. I think we missed
98240	108960	our deadline. It's like the Tower of Babel, humanity's been disbanded. I'm a lone wolf now.
108960	121360	I'm like that wolf that Tom Cruise saw in that movie. The movie was not called, what was your
121360	129240	guess? The lone wolf? No, no. That would be great. Was it called Wolf? No. Wolf of Wall Street? Nope.
129240	136800	These are all famous movies that are famous for not starring Tom Cruise, except for Spencer's
136800	142480	guess which is a non-existent movie. That would be the movie you'd expect him to see a lone wolf in
142480	148360	when he's a lone wolf. Would it though? Was it? That happens and then it's like lone wolf and then
148360	157960	the credits roll. It's like a three-minute movie. I know what it is. It was Wolfie McGuire. Why
157960	169040	wouldn't The Breakfast Club be about a sandwich with egg on it? Why wouldn't the title be a guy
169040	175200	falls through a ceiling while trying to go get his weed from his locker? That would be a terrible
175200	183600	title for Breakfast Club, but a great title for Weed Locker. Weed Locker. That was about the Iraq
183600	195720	War. That's Doug Benson's indie comedy movie. He shoots it in the Angeles desert. Is there an
195720	203320	Angeles desert? There's a forest. Okay, but next to it, is there any sand? Yeah, you go inland a
203440	207720	couple miles. Okay, and the trees run out and there's no ocean. Yeah, now you're an Angeles
207720	216880	desert. Now you're talking Angeles desert. Or you just hit Nevada. Maybe I should have said
216880	221640	Nevada, but it's like a one million dollar comedy. They got some investors, but it's like they're
221640	227200	pretending that it's about Doug Benson being an Iraq and it's called The Weed Locker. Just wanted
227200	237040	to finish my pitch. Although I agree with you, the movie sells itself. What is the Tom Cruise
237040	241560	movie you're talking about? Oh, you see him? He's a gray haired hit man in the back of a Wayans
241560	251640	Brothers. No, it was racist. Wait, who was it? Who's Jamie Foxx? Jamie Foxx? Wait, what? Jamie
252600	258160	Collateral. Oh, I thought you were telling me his name. I'm like, I'm not that often. No, it's that
258160	265400	person's name. I do not know. It's that person. Sounds like he won an Oscar. Hoatterwa. And the
265400	277840	winner is Hoatterwa. Hoatterwa is winning his first Oscar and will soon be a cab driver. We'll take
277840	283640	it up with White Society, you pricks. Don't look at me. I'm not the fucking one that's the cause of
283640	289320	this. That poor guy in the, what's that movie called? Captain My Captain. I'm the captain now.
289320	301480	Dead Poet Society? That's the only old captain. That was a Dead Poet Society called I'm the Captain
301480	311880	now, Captain. Just desk standers with an exclamation point. I found my, look what I found. Oh, a lot of
311880	317560	you, a lot of you plebs don't know what these are. I meant to bring you mine. I forgot. Earpods, my
317560	324640	earpods. These guys are going to be gone in like, like 48 hours. No way, man. I'm never gonna never
324640	330760	gonna lose you babies again. Where'd you even find those anyway? He put him in like he's dancing like
330760	336080	he's already playing music on him. I know that that's not how it works. I'm dancing like Brad Pitt
336080	344360	in Fight Club when he's, when he runs around the corner with, what's your name? Tim Burton's wife.
344360	354620	Sorry, ladies. Nothing she does can unobjectify her. She's still just some guy's wife. Helena
354660	361580	Cardo. And he drags her around the corner and then he just starts going like this, like as the cops
361580	368380	run by because if you're dancing in a junky hallway, you're not who they're looking for. This is the
368380	374300	only time I would say it was better to not pay the $5 a month for the live streams so they didn't
374300	380140	have to see that dance. They might have saved themselves the trouble on that one. To answer your
380620	389580	question, Spencer, you found them in your car. Oh, what? Yeah. Crazy. Why did I know that?
391980	403340	So I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was in the, it's not, it's not a hospital, it's a surgery
403340	409900	center. Excuse me. Trying to see if I can take care of that. They put a camera down my throat,
409980	415580	again, because here's the thing. Okay. This is a little crazy. Like, you know, I have a chronic
415580	424700	heartburn. I can't imagine why. Searching for a way to mitigate the burning pain in my esophagus.
424700	436060	Excuse me. The first time I went, they looked down my, my cake tunnel and, and they found some
436060	440140	polyps and they, they, they grabbed them and to send them off to a lab to see if they were
440140	445740	cancer polyps and, and they said like, oh, your digestive system looks great. And
448380	452300	like, I can't, what the fuck were they looking for that time? Because then the set,
452940	456780	I'm getting so upset just thinking about it. Because I went, I was, I told you last time,
456780	460140	I was a little upset in the last episode. You might've noticed a tonal shift here. I'm a little
460140	466300	calmer now. Are you, you were on like some pretty heavy duty painkillers. They give you for that.
466300	470220	Are you still floating on those or does that feel like it? But they tell you don't make any
470220	475660	business decisions today, no matter. That's what they say, which is kind of delightful. I was like,
475660	485580	I canceled my calls. Smithers. Don't, don't, don't call North Korea until tomorrow. Don't address
485580	493340	any Boy Scouts for God's sake. You might not be in a proper frame of mind to hold this stitching
493340	500220	of society together. Mind your P's and Q's sir. Don't, don't, don't go off on a psychotropic
500220	504300	substance stumbling into society. You might end up elected president. All right.
507100	511820	Don't have half a brain when you just run out into the street shouting whenever you're feeling.
512780	517580	Uh, you'll get rewarded for it endlessly and then die while killing everyone.
518860	524300	You wouldn't want that, Mr. Harmon. Goodbye. Want some Cheez-its? They gave, they gave me Cheez-its.
525500	531100	That's the one thing is like, after you wake up, you're like super high. Like it's great. It's like,
531100	535820	like they, it's kind of an intimidating thing to be rolled into a room where, where, you know,
535820	541420	it's a, you know, they don't, they don't design surgery rooms to be like, you know, they wouldn't
541420	546300	want like fluffy pillows in there and stuff with hair on them. Like the comfort, comfort goes hand
546300	552620	in hand with non-sterility. Like, you know, you wouldn't want like bean bags in your, in your room
552620	559820	or like oil paintings and the oil is going to get in your body. So it's like a grody, creepy jigsaw
559820	566140	room. Like, like, like, and, but clean, but still like sociopathic and you just beeping and you can
566140	569900	hear your heart beeping. And then when you hear your heart beeping, it starts beeping faster and,
570700	573660	and then you try to experiment with lowering it because you think you're going to blow their mind
573660	581660	and go like, who are you? Beep, beep, beep. You feel like, like I'm just seeing an eagle in the sky.
583660	587660	And then, but then they, then they like, they start this fucking thing through the IV and they
587740	591900	just like, this time they didn't even say countdown from 10 to one. Like they were just like, they
591900	596780	just didn't even give a fuck. And I was like, and it was just, boom, you're out. And I'm like, you're
596780	602300	instantly awake. Nothing happens. You don't, it's not like being asleep where you have like this
602300	607740	weird consciousness of time. It's like fucking, it's like a cut. And then you're in a different room
607740	612140	and no one else is there because they left your ass because, because you're boring because you
612140	616700	have been knocked out. Like it's a, you feel abandoned because you're like, wait, everybody
616780	620300	left. But it's like, no, we were all here with you. We rolled you like the furniture you are into a
620300	623820	corner after we cut some polyps out of your stomach, fucking chill out. When you start
623820	629740	babbling like a maniac, we'll come back and give you Cheez-its. Why is Cheez-its the go-to snack?
629740	633980	I don't know, but why do they follow the bag of Cheez-its with a lecture about why you're fat?
633980	640620	Like that's the thing. I never said the phrase, you guys gave me the Cheez-its so many times today
641260	645980	because they kept going in and they're like, you want some Cheez-its? I'm like, yes.
647820	653100	Am I in heaven? And then the Cheez-its are like, okay, the doctor will be right in. And then
653100	657900	another person comes in and goes like, Mr. Harmon, listen, you know, we didn't find anything in there
657900	664540	that's not the result of like, you know, a guy your age having gained your amount of weight.
664540	670700	You guys gave me the Cheez-its. No, I know, sir. I just saying like, it just kept happening like
670700	674540	different people kept coming in. Did they give you like the airport size bag of those or like,
674540	679580	like a baby? There's a little baby bag. Like, I just kind of felt like maybe if I wasn't eating
679580	684780	Cheez-its with crumbs all over my face, that maybe they would have laid off the fat lectures a little
684780	690220	bit. Because at least, I'm not saying I would have looked thinner with now out Cheez-its in my hand,
690220	696300	but maybe they would have thought like, well, he must not know that he's fat. For all we know,
696300	700460	he started his diet yesterday. Let's not fuck with him too much. But they were like, dude,
700460	705660	you're fat. I'm like, you gave me Cheez-its. Yeah, maybe trail mix, maybe something not so
707020	711260	fatty, like a cholesterol. Well, now that you're pitching that, I'm like, fuck, no,
711260	716060	that would be awful. That would be awful. Yeah, but you would feel that you would feel
716060	722140	like you were in a hospital, not a trail mix. What would be a good hospital? I don't know,
722140	727500	it'd be like a Robocop paste. Yeah, it's applesauce. It would be like in one of those
728220	732860	paper containers that when you finish, you can unfold it and turn it into a yarmulke.
732860	737420	But there must be some sort of like scientific reason, like is it because the salts, the fats,
737420	742620	like the things that you were defeated? Yeah, I'm sure they like, yeah, I'm sure. Or it's just
742620	747420	big Cheez-its. Big Cheez-its. Fucking involved. Yeah, they got like, uh, defibrillators with
747420	752460	the Cheez-it brand defibrillators. They're, they're station areas, like Cheez-it station area. They're
752460	757100	like, what's going on here? And you leave your hospital, you called not a hospital, and you
757100	762940	realized that you were just at Nabisco the whole time. You look back in there because you hear,
762940	768060	you hear, you hear one squeaky hinge and you look back and the stage hands are hoisting the flat.
769020	775900	It's like, this isn't a giant box of crackers. I was in the Keebler elf tree and they were all
775900	781340	on stilts. I, I told you, I went under general anesthesia once for my wisdom teeth and I woke
781340	785980	up and something horrible had happened. Like there was a footprint on my chest and my belt was off.
789340	791980	I've been under three times. The doctor wasn't there and I asked the woman, like the nurse,
792060	796060	it's like, where's the doctor? He's like, yeah, yeah, he left.
798540	802140	Like, when? When? It's like a couple hours ago. I'm like, what's up? Like,
802140	807660	was it, did everything, did all my teeth come out okay? He's like, it was a struggle.
808940	815100	My belt, my belt was off. I went to sleep with my belt on and I'd tell you fucking for sure.
816220	819340	And then she showed me my teeth in a cup and it looked like they had gone
819340	826140	hammer and chisel on those motherfuckers because they had. And then I go home and my friend drove
826140	829740	me home. You have to have somebody to drive you home because you're, you know, you're high as a
829740	837500	kite. And I go to the, I go home. I have to get my, my prescription card. Have I ever told the story
837500	843900	before on the show? I can't remember. That's what we've both gotten. I have. Early on.
844860	847340	What'd you think though? It's kind of like gremlins too. You want to see it again.
848140	857500	You're not sure. You're like, wasn't there like a, like a trans gremlin in there in that movie
857500	862780	that like transitioned and like was like kissing other gremlins? I can't remember. I think we need
862780	867500	to watch it again. I think the only, the only funny part for me was that I, I went to go get my
867500	871900	insurance, like my prescription card. And then while I was up there was so high, I thought, oh,
871900	879100	I'm taking trash out. So I threw my prescription card out with the trash. And then I get to the
879100	883340	place and now the paint, the paint colors are wearing off. I'm dying. We had to go figure out
883340	888380	where my thing was. And I was just now not high enough to remember to dig through my trash and
888380	892540	find the fucking thing. Yeah. That's why they wouldn't let me take an Uber from the, from the
892540	899740	place. Also they said it's sexist and you should take a left, but they wouldn't let me take an
899740	904220	Uber because they're there. And they were like, oh, you have to be like a limo service that we
904220	910620	have a relationship with. And I'm like, okay, the Cheez-It transit company, maybe cheese wheels.
910620	914700	Your courage tastes like it. Fucking wheels are square. It's getting, gets shitty mileage.
914700	922300	Shaped like a Trisket. So the, the salty, salty Rover. They can't, they shouldn't be giving you
922300	926860	fucking Cheez-Its after you've had a surgery. That's crazy. Well, the customer is always right,
926860	930620	man. I, I'm telling, I think at that point they're like, we put a camera down your throat,
930620	934300	you survived one bag of crackers. Did you get to see the camera? Do you get to look at the
934300	938220	apparatus before it goes down your goal? They don't show you the, I didn't know. I'm sure I could
938220	942700	have asked. I don't think they probably want you to see it though. I was, I was, I was, I was kind
942700	946460	of like, I could have asked this time because I kind of like, this is like my third time going,
946460	950940	you know, I had a, I had a endoscopy and then I had a biopsy for the sarcoid thing. And then I,
950940	954940	this was my second time going under and I like a lightweight, you know, so like, this isn't even
954940	959260	like surgery. This is just like, so I was like, I was fucking Bill Murray in that shit. I was like,
959260	962700	they're wheeling me in. I'm like, Hey, Glenda, how's it going? Still looking good.
965180	972380	My name's, my name's Diane and that, that, that, that isn't funny anymore. Just pointing at women
972380	977180	and sexualizing them. That's, that was, you were a hero in the eighties if you did that. Sorry,
977260	984220	I'm 44. We, I know I'm senior x-rays. But they, but they like, you know, doctor, doctor, doctor,
984220	989980	what's his fuck? He's like, Hey, Dan, welcome back. I said, it's good to be back. I was like,
989980	994860	I was like a real charmer. You know, I mean, I get like a hair net on, I'm laying down. I'm like,
994860	1000140	it's good to be back. I'm like, this guy thinks he's in some kind of lounge. Yeah. I was cool,
1000140	1004860	man. I wasn't getting a lot of laughs, but I was like funny. I just think doctors, like, I just
1004940	1007260	think I wouldn't want them to be cracking up because then it'd be like, these guys are
1007260	1011820	shakable. Like, I don't want that. They're focused on their craft, but I know I was being funny.
1014860	1018140	I'm sure they have like, they probably have like an orientation video where they're like,
1018140	1022060	look, some of your patients, you're in Los Angeles, some of your patients are going to be crackups,
1022060	1026540	you know, like they're going to be talented people, like, like crazy geniuses, you know,
1026540	1032860	some of them are going to have a gift for moving the human heart. You got to like, like, trust me,
1032860	1037340	as much as it seems like they would love for you to break into gales of frivolity, as much as it
1037340	1048860	would be involuntary, truly, given their hilarity acumen. Just keep a stiff upper lip. They probably
1048860	1059900	do things like, you know, like soldier guys, like they, they like, yeah, why did I, the only thing,
1060060	1064700	I'm like, I gotta try to make this specific. I'll just make them men.
1066140	1067900	You went way out of your way to make them older.
1068780	1071500	That was the final result. That was not the intention. I was trying to, I was trying,
1071500	1073340	I was like, God, come on, Tom Clancy, do it.
1075740	1080140	Soldier guys. Now it sounds like you've been in the military.
1081820	1083900	I, you know, like you said, surgery room.
1083900	1087580	Infantry. I was trying, I think I was searching for infantry and came up with soldier guys. You
1087660	1091900	can't turn soldier into infantry in soldier infantry. You'll sound like an idiot. I went
1091900	1098300	soldier guys. I fucking saved it. In their training, one of the things they have to do,
1098300	1103740	or so I've seen in movies, is that they, you know, like they, they expose you to tear gas, right?
1103740	1107980	Like, or, you know, whatever you're using on other people, they're like, take off your gas mask. Yeah,
1107980	1112700	you've seen that scene in the movies and they, you gotta like sit there and take the fucking tear gas.
1112700	1116700	They probably do. They have to do that with comedy in the operating room.
1118140	1121980	They have to hear all the dumb semi sedated jokes that they're going to hear.
1121980	1124940	They have to watch like season two of community.
1129740	1132780	I was going to, you know, when I started that sentence, I was going to say like,
1132780	1136460	the British office. But then I was like, I think that was one season.
1136460	1138940	And then I was like, do parks and rec. And I was like, fuck it.
1138940	1142460	Write what you know.
1144860	1149420	I stole, I stole the line that Greg Proops uses every time for the last 30 years at his dentist.
1149420	1154460	He's been going to forever. And every time he gets in the chair, every time the dentist asks him,
1154460	1156380	are you comfortable? And Greg always says, I make a living.
1161340	1165020	That's always a goodie. But it's funnier if you're an old Jewish comic.
1165020	1170220	I said, it's a little exchange I had. I'm no Greg Proops. But he said, welcome back.
1170220	1174700	I said, it's good to be back. And he said, how are you feeling? And I said, I said, great.
1174700	1178620	I just had a huge sandwich. And because you're not supposed to eat for like eight hours,
1179500	1182940	because they're going to go in there. And he's like, oh, thanks for telling us.
1182940	1185580	I said, look, if you found a sandwich in the bathroom, you'd eat it too.
1188540	1192540	These are good jokes. Yeah, these are good. And they're stone faced.
1193420	1195900	And it's not because I'm not funny. It's because they're good doctors.
1197340	1199660	They want me to stay alive, make more people happy.
1200860	1204860	Why don't we make your next HBO special just you on a gurney?
1207260	1213420	And you're really letting the doctor staff have it. Yeah. You're making light of what
1213420	1216060	could potentially be a fatal thing that's going on here.
1216060	1220060	I could. They always have to tell you they feel like they got to tell you there's like a 0.01
1220060	1224460	chance you'll wake up and choke on the camera and die. Isn't that crazy that they put a camera
1224460	1228140	down your throat and like, like, it's like, like, like, if you were to wake up, it's like,
1228140	1231740	it's exactly like Wiley coyote. Like when he runs off the edge of the cliff, as long as he doesn't
1231740	1236780	just fucking stay in the zone, Wiley, like, like you can just the time it took for you to mug to
1236780	1241020	the camera and hold up a sign that says, yikes, you could have made it to the other cliff.
1241020	1244220	You can technically fly. You just have to be less self-aware.
1245100	1251900	Uh, if you have a camera down your throat, they can just churn you like a butter bucket.
1253100	1259020	Sure. They can just churn you like the, like the fuselage on a butter churn.
1260540	1265740	Uh, but if you were to wake up, simply wake up, you'd be like,
1267660	1271260	and you'd immediately die because there's a camera down your throat.
1271260	1274060	Because if you were in a bar fight, that's a way to kill you.
1275980	1282220	You have a bar fight in like an AV room, like a, like a, like a bar fight with like, uh, filmmakers.
1283980	1286540	Why was my belt off and why didn't they put it back on?
1289900	1293820	What message were they trying to send me? Like, no, no, leave it off. Leave it off.
1293820	1298380	I want him to know exactly what the emotional crisis I went through.
1298460	1302300	If the doctor was in the room, it would, it would just be like, kind of like, Oh, was I,
1302300	1306220	you know, it's like, it's almost not funny. Cause it's just sort of like, Oh, what happened?
1306220	1308860	But the fact that the doctor's gone makes it funny to me. Cause it's like,
1308860	1311900	there's this story happened that he was like, I need some space.
1313580	1317660	And then she's like, I want to start sexually assaulting other, other patients.
1317660	1320860	It's like ordinary people now that are like, she's holding, she's trying to hold it together.
1320860	1324540	And he's like, where'd the doctor go? He'll be back when he, when you have calmed down.
1324540	1327660	Yeah. Yes. He's staying at shutters for three weekends.
1328780	1331580	She's like, he'll be, he'll be back later. And then she's like cleaning some tools.
1331580	1335660	And then like 20 seconds comes by and she goes, you know, he's a good doctor and he works hard.
1337340	1343420	And you're like, what the fuck? So he's allowed to grab to play with my dick.
1343420	1346540	Is that what you think happened? But then the thing, the thing that they tell you,
1346540	1349660	like, when you're getting, I had all four wisdom teeth out way too late in life.
1349660	1354140	And they said that there's a chance that a whole, it stopped me if I've talked about this before.
1354140	1358460	There's a chance that you'll perforate the sinus bone up here above your, your teeth.
1359100	1362380	And I remembered signing that thing. Oh yeah. And if it happens, it's not a big deal. Your
1362380	1366060	bone will regenerate. It'll, you know, it'll be a thing. I don't remember that after the
1366060	1371660	thing, cause I'm drugged out of my mind. The next morning I get up, rinse my mouth out.
1371660	1375340	Like you're not supposed to like spit and do anything with violence with your sinuses.
1375340	1379100	And I lean forward and everything in my mouth poured out of my nose because there's a hole
1379180	1383820	in my face. And now everything, then I was eating some miso soup and I leaned,
1385180	1389500	that night I leaned over, I leaned over to get more miso soup. And the miso soup that was
1389500	1397740	currently in my mouth went back into the bowl. You're like a Muppet. You're like the cookie
1397740	1404460	monster. This motherfucker. I was like cookies. I was a, I was a fountain. And then I freaked out.
1404460	1407740	And I was like, like, I, I called the doctor and he's like, remember that we had this big
1407740	1411980	conversation and it's going to be fine. I go, what do I do? He goes, just don't sneeze for two
1411980	1420220	months. Fuck you. Where's my Cheez-Its? Where's my Cheez-Its? The last time you talked about this,
1420220	1424140	I probably mentioned this. We're like an old married couple that both have dementia
1424140	1428860	and we're just triggering each other. Like, what is the Navy soup? Navy? I was in the Navy.
1428860	1435100	You were in the Navy. I was in the, I, I, I, I, I. Your story is going to be about the
1435100	1440380	song Me So Horny. But there's a, there's a, there's a nerve in your upper lip. That's why in
1440380	1445500	cartoons, like when Scooby Doo's about to sneeze, Shaggy, like, like, put his thing. It's like,
1445500	1448700	I always thought, I always thought that was so dumb. It was like, oh, but it's like, there's like,
1448700	1452540	if you push really hard on your upper lip, like, if you're ever in a situation where you feel like
1452540	1456860	you truly have to sneeze and like, it's a, it's a do or die, like, I've done it. It works. Like,
1456860	1460540	you just shove really hard. It's like some kind of nerve in there. Oh, well. All right.
1461420	1467180	Okay. So it's not about the nose. It's about the, it's about the lip. Yeah. It's pushing on the lip.
1467180	1470860	I don't know why you'd have to do it with your, with a fucking gangster style with your side of
1470860	1474380	your finger. I don't know why people don't go like this. I guess. Cause if people were coming
1475260	1479180	like from behind you or in front of you, they'd say, is that, is that dude picking his nose? And
1479180	1484540	you said you want to be like, no, dude, I'm like, uh, I'm like, I'm just doing a crazy mustache,
1485180	1489900	game. And then you can tell him later, sorry about lying to you. I was trying to stop sneezing.
1489900	1493900	And they're like, oh, cool. I thought you were trying to mime a mustache. No, dude.
1493900	1497500	But, and I was like, well, shit, at least you weren't picking your nose. Like, no,
1497500	1501340	it didn't even look like it did it. No. Cause you weren't using the tip of your finger.
1502620	1506220	Conversely, if you're a ninja, what I learned in ninja magazines in the eighties is that
1508300	1513660	you want to point your sword directly at your prey because it's invisible from a distance that
1513660	1518780	way. Think about it. You hold your sword like this. Oh, there's a ninja. He's got a sword.
1520140	1522220	Go like this. What's that ninja doing?
1526140	1528140	I'm going to kick his ass. I'm going to charge at him.
1529260	1532620	I'll tell you right now, if I see a ninja in front of me and I can't tell what he's doing,
1532620	1535820	I know he's doing something fucking ninja style. Well, because of the magazines, but
1537740	1540300	I mean, a lot of ninjas were mad at these magazines in the eighties. Like
1540300	1550300	did you have a subscription to your magazine? It was 1982 and you got one with your locker.
1551340	1554940	Did I have ninja stars? I had all the ninjas. Yeah. I mean, you could make them out of paper,
1554940	1558460	right? You know how to make a ninja star out of paper. You millennials know how to make a ninja
1558460	1564620	star out of paper. I got, I heard some mixed messages there, but, uh, mostly no. That's
1564620	1568700	something. That's something you could learn. A lethal, a lethal ninja star when I could break,
1568700	1572620	break skin. Well, no, you hit someone as with everything. If you hit someone in the eye with
1572620	1578860	it, I'm sure it could do some damage. That goes for socks, pillowcases, ferrets. Because when I
1578860	1583180	was in popcorn, when I was like, kisses, if you kiss someone in the eye really hard, you could
1583180	1593340	blind them or you can give them mono. Mono-acleosis. That's what they call it. It's when you get it in
1593420	1601020	the eye. That's just, that's just science, you pieces of shit. Mono-acleosis. That's what that,
1601020	1608940	that's what the Cyclops had in, uh, uh, the, uh, the, you panish ads. The, uh, the, uh, the, uh, Odyssey.
1608940	1613740	Spencer, were you ever a weapon enthusiast? Did you have like throwing stars? Oh yeah. Katanas.
1614700	1621100	I mean, come on. Do you even have to ask? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Just Chinatown. You could get
1621100	1628060	anything, man. This guy, this guy invented seagull hunting. Yeah. Oh, that's right. By burying
1628060	1632780	yourself in the sand and having a bag? What was your weapon of choice? That, that was in a ninja
1632780	1638940	magazine. I tuned it towards seagulls of course. It was, it was, that was like retired ninja
1638940	1647740	quarterly. Yeah. Like, uh, fulfilled your blood oath. Uh, kids moved out. Try hunting some seagull.
1647740	1657100	It's a great way to placate your neurotic compulsion to avenge and be invisible. Without, uh,
1658860	1665980	without, without pinching the pocket. I can see Spencer, I, I, correct me if I'm wrong,
1665980	1671740	I can see you as having owned at least one pair of nunchucks in your lifetime. Not nunchucks, no. No?
1671740	1676700	Those are, those are dangerous, man. You really gotta know how to use them before they stop being
1676700	1682780	dangerous to oneself. Yeah. Yeah. Nunchucks is the weapon that kills you before you kill you. Yeah.
1682780	1687260	You learn to kill somebody else with it. I think that's why in every scene in movies,
1687260	1692700	like that's why the person starts off with like 10 minutes of like nunchucking because he's,
1692700	1696300	because then the person's supposed to think like, goddamn, that's a long time without hitting
1696300	1703500	yourself in the nuts. I better get the fuck out of here. If this guy decides to hit me in the head,
1703500	1709100	he might succeed. I'm fucking next. He has avoided his groin for many, many minutes. And
1709100	1714380	he keeps going down. Yeah. No, he's purposely, it's like Houdini asking people to punch him.
1714380	1716540	He's going between the legs, Harlem Lope trying to shit.
1719180	1723020	Uh, I think we, I think we, I think we, we, we should, we should, uh, get our guest, uh,
1723020	1727020	prepared. Is she, is she ready back there or do we need to, do I need to say that and then pause
1727020	1732300	so that like, uh, I don't know, there's no feedback. There's no feedback loop in this show. We don't
1732300	1738540	know what we're doing. I'm just flying blind. Uh, our guest is a, is a new friend. I, I met her
1739260	1744060	through, I don't know, kind of strange circumstances, but, uh, they're, they're also kind of boring
1744060	1750620	circumstances because they're kind of work related, but, but, but, uh, I just, I, I, I, uh, I was like,
1750620	1754620	well, this is a person that we should meet. I don't know. I don't, I don't, I'm bad at introductions.
1754620	1760220	She's a, she's a, she's a rapper. She has a bus. She's just back from Burning Man and boy,
1760220	1768380	are her wheels tired. Um, her arms burnt. I think that's, yeah. Um, uh, let's bring up, uh, B-Squid.
1783980	1786620	That's, that's the music we picked to bring you on. It's beautiful.
1787580	1793420	Hello, B-Squid. Hello. B-Squid, are you, are you, are you a, are you a drinker? Do you want,
1793420	1798540	do you, do you want me to touch your ice? You can touch my ice. Do you, do you want ice? Yeah,
1798540	1803820	I'd love some ice. Thank you. Hey Dan, can I, can I touch your ice? You want to touch my ice? I want
1803820	1809660	to touch your ice. You can touch my ice. I'll touch hers. Let's not touch each other's ices.
1810700	1814140	Here, this is my ice. Hand this to Jeff so he can touch it. This is a touchy subject, you guys.
1817340	1825100	Yeah, you need that right now. Thank you. What's that? How did you guys meet? What's the origin
1825100	1833900	story of your friendship? We met in the, in the desert hot springs. We had both just robbed
1833900	1840140	different banks, uh, and we were burying our briefcases under the same tree. Uh, you know,
1840140	1846060	me and Cody and, uh, and, uh, and our mutual friend, Evan, uh, were, uh, up there. I was
1846060	1850460	working on this Vonnegut thing that I'm adapting with Evan, Sirens of Titan, and Cody was working
1850460	1856460	on her thing. Um, and, uh, we decided let's take a week and, uh, and, and I've never tried that.
1856460	1861420	Cody always does that. She gets results. Like, she goes away like a, like a sick cat that goes
1861420	1866540	under the stove. Like, like, where's the cat? And it comes out and goes, I wrote a draft. Um,
1867500	1874140	um, uh, I was like, I want to try that. And, and, and, and, uh, yeah, and it did work. Evan,
1874140	1879500	I would go out there and like, so I was, we, we got two like bungalows in the, in the, in this,
1879500	1885500	in this like resort. And, uh, and it's like at a discount because it was so goddamn hot and you're
1885500	1891340	going to the desert. They're like, if you come here and we'll give you like a dollar. Um, uh,
1891340	1895500	and then, and then there was a, and then we worked for like a, a, a business week. And then toward
1895500	1901500	the end of it, you, uh, came up in your bus because you're friends with Evan. Yeah. It's not
1901500	1904700	that exciting a story, but it's also kind of like, would you say you have a bus? Like what, what,
1904700	1910860	what kind of bus am I picturing right now? It's a short bus. Uh, it's painted blue. It says my name
1910860	1917100	on the side. It says B squid. I used it to tour in. So it's where the country and you, and you
1917100	1927100	perform rapping. I rap. Yes. I do rap shows around, uh, up here around the coast and inland and
1927100	1933580	anywhere they'll have me. Um, and you, you, you do a lot of live performance, right? I mean, obviously.
1933580	1938700	Yeah. But like, so, so are there, are there, are there live venues that make you more nervous or
1938700	1944300	that you hate doing or, you know, everyone is like a totally different experience. There's, uh,
1944300	1949740	some that are bigger. Um, and sometimes they're fuller than others. And sometimes they're kind of
1949740	1954860	empty for big places. And that's kind of weird. Uh, but I don't think there's anything really
1954860	1959420	that makes me more nervous than anything else except for, I guess sometimes when you're in that
1960380	1965340	environment where, you know, you've got people who you care about like watching and then you're
1965340	1970300	really, it's like really on your family or friends or both. Oh yeah. Like family and friends. And
1970300	1973740	you're like, Oh shit, I can't believe I wrote this line into the song. And then you're just
1973740	1978060	like kind of jump over it weirdly. And you know, that kind of thing. So when people like, how do
1978060	1981980	you explain to your family, does your family like kind of bust your balls? Like, like, like, like,
1981980	1987740	when you, like you like, they're like, so what do you do? And you're like, I'm a, is it hard to say
1987740	1993580	I'm a rapper? Sometimes they support me generally. I mean, we're all a little weird. I guess my dad
1993580	1999260	is a piano technician and my sister is, um, she like builds Moog synthesizers and she's studying
1999260	2004940	for that. Oh, okay. So they really support me in my, when I decided I was going to take the music
2004940	2010300	route. Um, because I've been working in film all this time and that was like also a little weird
2010300	2014540	for some of the people who I grew up with. It was like, Oh, it's like a creative field and you're
2014540	2019500	never going to make it in film. But you know, here we are. So we have another mutual friend,
2019500	2023500	open Mike Eagle, who was on the show a couple months ago and you know him too. That's what we
2023500	2027740	discovered over, over dinner. And, uh, but, but, but so I just wanted to drop that. Uh,
2029260	2034780	you need to respect me as an interviewer. Hell yeah. I will close this mic and turn it into a
2034780	2041420	Falcon. Uh, so dumb. I'm like, but he's fine. Why am I, why am I shitting on him? All right.
2042140	2046460	So how did you get involved? How did you get involved in rap? How did you get interested in
2046460	2050380	it? What drew you to it? He said your primary interest was film. So then take us to the
2050380	2054940	threshold in your bio pic where you're like, I'm, I'm a rap. Well, I've always written poetry,
2054940	2059500	like since I was a little kid. Um, and then I started to go through this phase like in,
2059500	2065260	you know, 2010, 2011, where like, if I would get mad at work, I would just be like, Oh yeah,
2065260	2071260	well I'm going to write a poem and I would do that. Uh, and I wouldn't, you know, share them
2071260	2077820	with anybody, but eventually like somebody showed me like hip hop music and then I was able to take
2077820	2082620	these secret poems I was writing and, and stitch them over beats and then make something really
2082620	2089340	awesome. Um, and I put out a music video once and it got a lot of attention kind of right away.
2089340	2095740	Um, and so the, someone called me and asked me to come and screen that video at this event that
2095740	2101260	he was throwing at O'Brien's in Santa Monica. And I was like, I'm not going to screen that
2101260	2105660	shitty video. It's not happening, but I'll do a 30 minute set. And he was like, all right,
2105740	2110860	that's great. Cool. Booked two months later. I had to write that music because I didn't have any,
2110860	2114700	but, um, I put it together. It may happen. I think that's how the good people have there for,
2114700	2118380	you know, like if, you know, just like somehow your ego like makes you say you're going to do
2118380	2122140	something and like, what up? That's what channel one on one was for filmmakers when we were starting
2122140	2128860	it in 2003. God, whatever it was like Rob and I knew if we don't, if we don't have a, like an
2128860	2132460	appointment, like where everyone's going to either know that we suck because we didn't finish
2132460	2137260	something or we have something like that's there. Yeah, whatever. Why am I explaining this to you?
2138860	2141100	Do you make your own beats or do you have people that you work with?
2141100	2147180	I work with people. Um, I have beat people. I have a friend in New Orleans who I met when I was
2147180	2151740	working on a job over there. His name is Radi Skervix. He produced my full album, my first album,
2151740	2156300	which I put out in November. It's called cloud nine. Um, and then I have another producer who
2156300	2161180	I work with regularly. His name is DJ bless one and he lives in El Paso. So sometimes when I'm
2161180	2165420	crossing the country to tour, I'll like stop with Radi and we'll make a song and then I'll stop with
2165420	2170220	bless and we'll make a song and then, you know, wherever I can do that. Who was the first,
2170220	2173740	I know you had like kind of a mentor character you were telling me about when we were talking,
2173740	2182700	but then also like who just pop culturally, like, like, who was the rap, uh, artist that kind of,
2182700	2188620	like they, I don't know, like your early, uh, I want to, now I really want to do this because
2188620	2191820	I'm listening to this all the time or I don't know, early influence. Is that what I'm trying
2191820	2196540	to get around to? One of my favorite bands growing up was this screamo band called glass jaw.
2197180	2202620	And I love them until the day I die. Um, and they're amazing. But anyway, it's a little
2202620	2207340	intense, very different screamo screamo. Yeah. I'm not familiar with that. Oh yeah. It's like
2208380	2214620	emo where they surmise to know that I am not familiar with screamo. I feel like you might
2214620	2219900	be. I mean, you're a screamo fan, but you're there. I just don't know what it is. I might,
2219900	2227820	might be my new favorite thing. Well, they'll sing and they'll have their heavy guitars and it's like
2227820	2233100	kind of a, I don't know, like an indie hardcore music genre, but then they scream at the top of
2233100	2240620	their lungs. Like, and it's beautiful. I don't, I, if I scream once I lose my voice. Right. It's art.
2240620	2247820	What they do is craft the people that can scream after night song, like do a two hour set night
2247820	2252060	after night on a tour. Like, yeah, that is a craft. There is something in there happening. But are
2252060	2259420	these screamo rapping? No. So there was a singer. His singer's name is, don't embarrass your son.
2260700	2264460	Well, I mean, anybody can rap, you know, like, I think probably one of the first raps that I
2264460	2269180	learned was like in a rancid song, you know, which without even realizing that that was
2269180	2272780	rap. I just, I just like really liked the fast chop of it and I wanted to learn it.
2273580	2277740	And then, but anyway, the, the singer of Glassjaw, his name is Darryl Palumbo and he
2277740	2284540	did a hook for an artist named Cage and Cage was out of New York. And I listened to that album to
2284540	2288780	hear that hook, like that part where he sings. I heard the whole album and I bought it and now I
2288780	2295180	have it. I grew up with it, you know, because of that. So like, I kind of let like people who I'm,
2295180	2300620	you know, loving and following like to bring me to my next kind of like bubble to explore in and
2300620	2306940	then to the next thing. So yeah. Well, here comes the, the part where I show you that I'm bad at
2306940	2312380	what I do. And I don't mean rapping, which I will blow your mind with later. Yes, you will. But
2313900	2318220	it will blow my mind if we can just do this like willy-milly, but you did bring like a thumb drive
2318220	2323260	of beats, didn't you? And do we, are we, would you mind like doing like, what would you like
2323340	2329020	most? What would you be following your bliss? Do you want to just do one of your numbers? I sound
2329020	2340460	like your dad. Can you spin some of your wax for us? Or, or whatever. I mean, what, what's your
2340460	2346460	preference to do? Like, like, I mean, I brought four different songs with me to perform, but I
2346460	2350780	don't expect to be able to have time to do all of them. So I mean, I could do whatever. Yeah, I could
2350780	2354700	like spit one. No, I think like you should, you should do one. That's like, all right. Well,
2354700	2359260	well, here, I'll, I'll, I'll, Dan's playing what you should do then. What did you, if you, unless,
2359260	2364140	unless there's something that would make you happier, do one. That's just like your thing that
2364140	2368460	you do. And then, and then we'll talk a little more because there was like this, you just came
2368460	2373260	back from burning man. And I want to talk about that thing, the not burning man, but the other
2373260	2383180	thing. The, but, but, and, and then at a certain point, obviously I'm gonna get some like open mic
2383180	2388700	eagle taught me like lessons about my freestyling. I want those lessons. Well, I'll give you his
2388700	2392220	lessons, but then I need more from you because I didn't come here for nothing. Do I call you,
2392220	2396460	be squid or do I call you by your first name? You can call me be squid or squid or
2396620	2401100	Allie. Cause that's also my name. Allie. All right. So what if it was Agnes?
2403180	2407260	Then it would be amazing. Obviously Agnes would be the greatest name of all time. I know Agnes.
2407260	2412620	Yeah. Go Agnes. Like my, my, my riff of what a, what a, what a sad name would be. It's like,
2412620	2417260	like, yeah, no, that would be cool. Cause that's, I'm 44. But squid, are you, are you a comfortable
2417260	2421420	freestyler? Do you like that? Or do you, is that something you enjoy? It's something I enjoy. I
2421420	2425660	actually haven't broken my public freestyling cherry. So that would be a thing. Well, the bar
2425660	2433340	is incredibly low here. You're going to be the Babe Ruth of freestyling. But I think first let's,
2433340	2437740	you know, like, let's, let's, let's, let's warm up with just a like one of your, how do you,
2437740	2441980	how do you tell them what to play though? If you wanted to just do one of your set things. I want
2441980	2447500	to do a thousand winters. Fantastic. It was the one I said I wasn't going to do. Zach, you up on
2447500	2458860	that, Zach? Yeah. All right. It's, we don't, you know, we don't always do this. It's worth the wait.
2463180	2469900	Should I like stand up? Yeah. Make a show biz. What about a lighting, a lighting effect?
2469900	2472300	That's a little less butcher shopping.
2499900	2507180	My eyes. Because I know you're waiting too and all my thoughts involve you.
2507180	2512300	Don't tell me what I cannot do for my own good. I'll wait for you. I'm searching time and watching
2512300	2517820	clothes for all the signals coast to coast. Clouds are painting tentacles, compass pointing where to
2517820	2523660	go. East into the sunrise. Cause I try and try to land a time to sandy a time like paper with
2523660	2528860	some grit. Unleash a shine with blue balloons. I float to you where I will grow it out of these
2528860	2534460	boots. And if you leave and travel on, my heart will follow with a song. You could take my magic
2534460	2539340	wand, repeat these spells across the pond. One week flies by like Dumbo did. They thought he'd fall,
2539340	2544460	but he learned to live. Of all the hearts this road will bring, I hope each one enlightens me. So
2544460	2550220	in your presence, I am free to gift you with eternity. Lighter than a feather, I am stricken
2550220	2556780	like a match. You and me expand to fill the space and plug the gaps. I miss you, need you, want you
2556780	2561740	bad. And while we wait, we may go mad, but I'll be there when leaves turn brown and I'll be singing
2561740	2567340	you this song. Dream in daylight, think of me, I'm always somewhere you could be. Feeding every
2567340	2586700	harmony with hearts of possibility. If it takes forever, I will wait for you for a thousand
2586780	2600460	winters. I will wait for you till you're here, recycling, till I'm holding you, till I hear you
2600460	2619420	sigh, here in my arms. If it takes forever, I will wait for you for a thousand winters. I will wait
2619420	2634540	for you till you're here, recycling, till I'm holding you, till I hear you sigh, here in my arms.
2636540	2644780	Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go, every day remember I adore you so. In your heart,
2644780	2651980	believe what in my heart, I know that forevermore, I'll wait for you.
2651980	2676380	I was mortified in the beginning because there wasn't enough monitor or something.
2676380	2680140	I couldn't really hear the beat but then I kind of got it anyway.
2680540	2684860	If we do more, can we get more of the sound and the monitor?
2684860	2694620	When I'm up, I'll stop the show. I was kind of thinking maybe we could
2694620	2698780	experiment where either we play that same beat again and Dan tries to try.
2698780	2701740	Well, I think I got it, yeah. Okay, so let's put...
2705820	2710140	But I also want to hear that singer-songwriter hook stuff too.
2710140	2712540	Yeah, it's the song. No, I think I got it, I got it.
2712540	2713040	Okay.
2713040	2724640	Let's give it up for Pea Squid. Pea's on Squid.
2729680	2735760	Here are a thousand winters, I'll wait for you.
2735760	2751840	I'll have no splinters inside my shoes. Ours and winters and a half a dozen falls.
2751840	2757920	I went to my friend's house and I can't take it all.
2759280	2763040	Yeah, I'm sick of this shit, I'm sick of society shit, so sick of it, I'm gonna sit on it,
2763120	2767920	I'm gonna take my ass and put it down on it. I can't fucking hear it. God damn it.
2768640	2770720	Don't fuck with me. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
2775040	2777520	I saw everyone's feet and then I went up to the sky.
2779840	2783680	Can't fucking hear the beat. Piece of shit.
2783680	2792800	And a thousand falls. I'm sick of this shit. Gonna put it in a hat and spit in it and then
2792800	2798320	put it back on my head because I've got a zit. I went into my car, went and fired.
2798320	2802960	I drove to the moon and ate some tar. It burned me real far down my ass.
2804640	2810880	Too fast when you rap too fast. You can't improvise when you rap too fast.
2810880	2817840	There's no such thing as rapping that fast when you improvise.
2819360	2822800	I saw your mama the other day, she looked at me and asked if I was gay. I said,
2822800	2827920	I don't have that honor, bitch. Mom's closed mine and she's a homophobe.
2827920	2832080	I went down the street, got on a telephone. Why is there still a telephone on the street?
2832080	2839840	Because I'm a time traveler. My dad is Dan Rather.
2841200	2845120	Played by Robert Redford in the movie Truth. Have you heard about that?
2845120	2849040	It's about the thing about George Bush's military service.
2849040	2862720	For a thousand winters, what, what, what, thousand days, what, what, what,
2862720	2869040	for a thousand million calendars. Gonna sing the purple hairs.
2869920	2873360	Tell you what about that. Fuck about a cat. Fuck the dog too.
2873360	2878160	Then a rat put them all together in a jar through the shit and said, fuck it.
2884720	2888480	For a 35 springs.
2892400	2896320	I saw you the other day, you had a tattoo. I broke my heart. What about you?
2896320	2900640	I haven't seen you in 10 years. What's the Facebook status? Why is it still single?
2900640	2905760	You know, you got, you got into somebody else. Two weeks after we broke up, I sense overlap.
2907600	2914480	I'm not stalking. I sense overlap. I'm not a Facebook stalker. I'm policing overlap.
2916240	2921360	I police overlap. Think about that. Where's your butt flaps?
2921360	2925600	Wrap it up. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Dap. Think about that.
2929040	2943600	For a thousand winters, it snows so long. I hope my zombie dragon doesn't go to the wrong side.
2944480	2950080	I can't, got the dragon out of ice. Got some chains. Don't know how I made them.
2951360	2954560	I pulled the dragon out of ice, brought it back to life, made it to ice blue. Now I'm
2954560	2958480	gonna cut like a knife through the wall. The rubble's gonna fall. Then I'm gonna walk over
2958480	2967120	it all. I'm gonna go south. Right? I'll just get that mixed up. South is, is bad. South,
2967120	2970960	it's like the Korean thing. It's like you can never keep track. North of the wall is bad.
2971920	2978480	Fucking thousand winters. Yo, it's like a thousand winters. Yo, yo.
2980640	2984560	Ain't no fucking summer in sight, bitch.
2990960	2991760	I like this game.
2995040	2997760	I mean, I don't think my version's perfect. We're gonna go to the judges.
2997920	2999440	Brought tears to my eyes a little.
3001120	3004880	I don't think, you know, yeah, I don't think mine's perfect, but you had a chance to write yours and
3006400	3010800	I did have the advantage of watching yours, so it's even. Like, I think we tied.
3012480	3016720	I'd say so. But yeah, so open mic eagle, he divested me.
3018320	3020720	You're gonna, if you want to know how I got to that level,
3021520	3029200	open mic eagle, like he, he taught me that I don't have to say fuck your mama all the time.
3029200	3034320	Like it's a, do you have crutches when you freestyle? Like the phrases that you like lean on
3034320	3039200	when you're like, you know, killing time? Sometimes. What are, what are they?
3041040	3047040	I try not to repeat them, but like as an exercise. So right now, I mean, I guess if we start
3047040	3051760	freestyling, I think you'll figure it out, but you don't want to, you don't want to give them power.
3051760	3056800	Well, yeah, because they're, they're changing. They changed every time. So if I dropped the
3056800	3061040	fuck your mama's, which as soon as open mic left, I was like back on it. Yeah, it's like,
3061040	3065920	it's like the sauce, you know, you gotta everybody was cheering. Like he made me not say fuck your
3065920	3069040	mama for like a wrap. And it was like, you gotta push yourself. Everybody was like, yay,
3069040	3073600	you're learning and growing. And then he, and then he left. He's like, I'm rich. And I was like,
3073600	3081360	fuck your mama. But, uh, yeah, is there like, did any of the beats that you brought for
3081360	3086240	freestyling, are they kind of like a little slower? Apparently they're, they're all licensed,
3086240	3091280	but they were slower. I just, uh, you know, so I guess there's other beats, uh, on hand. Oh,
3091280	3096000	we have some, I mean, Dan, you, you really push yourself. I mean, lyrically, that was great. You
3096000	3101120	know, you really move very quickly there. Yeah. But the, the, the kicky baby dance was really,
3101120	3105920	really on point tonight. That was some good kicky baby going on there.
3108400	3111280	For me, that song is about, uh, the cycle of life.
3114000	3116320	My main takeaway is that you're sick of this shit. Yeah.
3120960	3125520	I think that's, that's the main message. Yeah. Kind of a through line. That's how I perceived,
3125520	3130400	that's, that's like my perception of like a female rapper. Well, she must be sick of this shit.
3131120	3133920	Like I'm like, I'm like sick of the shit. I wonder if that was like, like,
3133920	3137920	if anyone's rapping that fast, like, like what else could it be? Like, I don't know.
3138800	3143440	I'm just sharing my obstacles. Uh, Squid, do you think there's any, any chance,
3143440	3147760	like subconsciously that based on what you just saw that you might accidentally bite some of Dan's
3147760	3154400	freestyle, right? I hope I don't. I mean, I would feel really terrible if I did, you know, like,
3154400	3159040	because I respect you and your freestyles are sacred to that moment.
3159760	3166080	Is it lame to, uh, use the word lame to as a derogatory way for the, because it's ableist.
3166080	3175120	Okay. Starting over. Is it, is it bad? What a boring world we've created. I hope Nazis take it over.
3177600	3182240	Is it, is it negative to take more than three ibuprofen?
3183040	3188960	Is it, is it, is it, is it dumb? Is it bad that his beats are so retarded?
3191120	3194560	Is it bad to ask? I feel like this is something that journalism does to,
3194560	3199840	to the female persuasion when they're like, you know, like, like, like to, to corner you and say,
3199840	3206800	like, what's the state of, of women in rap like so that you might, but, but I don't think anyone's
3206800	3210000	listening to this. So like, if, I mean, I don't know, it's just like, what's your,
3210800	3216400	do you, do you have any opinions about that or are you like gender blind, like about rap and go?
3219600	3224080	In case you hadn't noticed, I'm a lady, no hating, just saying they always underpay me when new
3224080	3228560	lanes are laid in, I'm related, gaze changing, window pane is praying, new free way to play in,
3228560	3233200	escaping, creating something missed by education, labelers are looking for your contribution,
3233200	3237600	if laboring, tailoring, or execution, impaling, failure with a loose end, goose heads, body running
3237600	3241040	crazy and a chicken's pen, gotta feel for him, he's foreign to the lore where we're supposed to
3241040	3244640	get bored, it's a four whip, chores and performance is second to bird's eye, score to make the writ,
3244640	3248560	his court and orb of explorers sentiment, especially to movers and shakers who can't afford
3248560	3252080	u-halls are dumped by their players, the system regrets to inform him, his mission is cancelled
3252080	3255680	and wishing concussion, discussion of structure that he's been disrupting is kept at a minimum,
3255680	3259440	take this chrysanthemum, let's all remember him, in memorandum, the rebel of random reaction is
3259440	3262800	granted, museum in the hall of all fame, a graveyard of hunger pings served in the name
3262800	3270640	of the young and ashamed, so all right well i think you're avoiding the question i did okay
3271200	3277120	answer the fucking question so that's my um it's actually
3278960	3282720	i performed that rap i knew i knew we were both gonna do the same job
3284080	3288800	halfway through it did you stop listening to the actual i was like for the first time i was like
3288800	3292560	god damn this is like i'm like my brain is growing you snap to something the second half is like
3292560	3298400	what's the bit that i'm gonna do which is probably there's probably the second half of of that is
3298400	3303120	like and they're always just thinking about what they're gonna say next to me you know i love i
3303120	3307680	love being a female and i love doing what i do i think that you know it it's like you know the
3307680	3314160	game of um thrones guess who remember that game guess who right with all the dude's faces you're
3314160	3319600	like oh this one's got my guys got glasses or my guys got a beard or my guy's a lady and you're
3319600	3324160	like oh it's one of these two people okay so that's kind of what it feels like you know
3324160	3328880	like not a lot of people get your card but when they do get your card it's like it stands out you
3328880	3332560	know right so that's a good thing sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad sometimes whatever it's
3332560	3338640	good is what it is and i'm just strong independent woman i think i feel i try to be anyway and uh
3338720	3342800	and so i don't like really let the industry walk all over me which is why i'm
3344000	3348320	independent starring artist but hey you know you gotta do what you gotta do in this life
3349760	3354720	now you you're rocking at los felas cap are you a los felas native or yes i am well not a native
3354720	3358640	but i i live there that's where you live in it's where i live all right that's my hometown yeah
3358640	3364080	that's damn hometown um to just to get grim for a second because it's kind of just historically
3364080	3369520	grim like you were just a burning man and i've never been and uh you've been there many many
3370080	3377600	times seven times uh this and then we're like you're talking about the heat and i was like
3377600	3381520	and then the obvious dumb joke because i was like yeah it was a little literal burning man
3381520	3386160	there were burning men there and then you're like no there was one because this fucking thing
3386160	3390240	happened i don't know how many of you heard about this like it's probably easy to to miss
3390240	3397360	news these days like like but but do you i mean should i should i say what happened and then you
3397360	3402560	talk about it like or or do you want to just take it from there um well i was there uh and i was
3402560	3408000	sitting kind of like on a like on the i want to say the three o'clock side maybe from where i was
3408000	3413520	i wasn't able to see it occur at the fire but um when the man was burning this year on saturday
3413520	3419440	night there was a guy and his name was erin joel mitchell and he ran into the fire um and committed
3419440	3423360	suicide and that was actually really like a really sad thing i didn't find out about until
3423360	3429840	the next morning um you said he was in there for 30 minutes like 30 seconds oh 30 seconds 30 minutes
3429840	3435440	okay you know what still too long to be in a fire still too long he i'm sorry i know nothing about
3435440	3440320	this i i was wondering about there was a guy i got a guy just like ran into the fire but he
3440320	3446640	to to self emulate and and kill himself by fire at burning man i mean nobody knows why he did it
3446640	3452720	oh really nobody knows if he was on drugs or they know he wasn't drunk um they know that he had been
3452720	3459840	sober previously and that he was like a a beaming gentle soul and um and that you know you nobody
3459840	3464320	can really speak on why he did it or they think it's a sign of the times that i immediately was
3464320	3468640	like i don't i won't be surprised if i find out this isn't the case but the first thought in my
3468640	3475840	head is i wonder if this guy is just like fuck it this is it like like like this point in history
3475920	3482960	like and it's whether or not it often these things are they're not sometimes a cigar is a cigar and
3482960	3487280	like who knows why he did it but like it's it's already notable that that was the first thought in
3487280	3491440	my head because it wouldn't have been last year i wouldn't have been like i bet i bet he did that
3491440	3498960	because because the world is ending like it's so it's like but the other crazy thing is that is
3499920	3506480	is realizing that you were there the entire time you were on one side of a fire with a guy that
3506480	3510320	ran into it and basically never came out i mean they fetched him out and then he died in the
3510320	3516160	hospital um but you didn't find out about it till the next day and i was like okay so i need to
3516160	3521040	recalibrate my definition of what a large fire is because like i've never been a burning man i was
3521040	3528720	like like i how many people are gathered around the the actual burning man they say there's like
3528720	3533680	there were like 50 000 people there and so there's like a whole perimeter of like party
3533680	3538160	buses and art cars that kind of like surround it and then within that between that perimeter
3538160	3544640	and then there's like a perimeter of um you know rangers like making sure nobody runs into
3544640	3550000	the fucking fire um in between that is where everybody sits and stands and you know it's a
3550000	3555600	beautiful fire show there's like this whole procession beforehand it's like very ceremonious
3555600	3561280	you know they've been doing it i think like 30 years and then there's um fireworks the best damn
3561280	3569120	fire fireworks show you'll ever see that burn um and then uh and then the fire and the fire was
3569120	3574880	like insane this year like it was insane i mean it was kind of like a structure around the man
3574880	3579920	and the man was like in the center of it usually he's like up on a post or like up somehow but this
3580000	3586160	year the theme was radical rituals so what they did was they made the the man almost look like the
3586800	3592080	traditional temple that is at burning man as well so there was like kind of a secondary it was it
3592080	3596560	was a really spiritual year um at burning man there everything was built like it was a shrine
3596560	3600640	of some kind so when there's like cynical dots i'm connecting here you're described well this
3600640	3604880	year they tried something different where they had like an injury way on the fire
3604880	3612560	i mean they kind of designed it like a place you could go into i guess so i mean
3615200	3618320	this guy broke through the lines of marshals and people there
3618320	3623440	and made it made it through yeah and thrust himself into the fire and they got him out
3624640	3630160	like half alive they got him out like after 30 seconds and they you know flew him to safety but
3630160	3637440	he did it's really sad yeah i mean that's but we don't know why if that was a moment of
3637440	3642320	passion or something he'd been planning on or no idea yeah he apparently didn't leave a note
3642320	3646320	or anything what was the reaction after that happened like did how much of that crowd because
3646320	3651280	the whole crowd couldn't possibly have seen all that maybe right i mean i remember hearing like
3651280	3656800	sound come from the other side like sometimes the the whole crowd like you know sparks up some kind
3656800	3663440	of like chant or cheer or like wave of howling at the moon or like or somebody's like calling
3663440	3667760	for their friend sarah and they're like sarah and then the whole crowd is screaming sarah
3667760	3672400	until this girl sarah's fucking found or something but i mean like you could hear something was
3672400	3677200	happening on the other side but i i mean and you've done that sometimes in a row like been
3677200	3682960	kind of there at the fire and and so yeah and you you you look back and and go oh yeah something
3682960	3689200	happened but something's always happening and i mean that that is such a that's such a weird
3689200	3696720	crazy metaphor for if i end that sentence with life i devalue my observation because this sounds
3696720	3701760	dumb that's such a metaphor for life but but it is i mean it that you can't say that's a metaphor
3701760	3706640	for society you can't say that is that is what life is that's great that we're all gathered together
3706640	3712240	and that there is tragedy happening that that from a distance from the other side of the of
3712240	3715840	the fire which is the greatest thing that's ever happened and it's like there can be a person
3716480	3723040	it and and and and it can be mistaken from certain perspectives for just a another part
3723040	3730160	of a celebration and then the next day it's like yeah dude yeah i it's like i like like
3731040	3735280	unrelated to that because i don't want to follow up that story with like i want to go to burning
3735280	3742320	man at this point i like like i i but but it's like at this point yeah after the in the
3742320	3747120	aftermath of the election and stuff it's like my mind and soul are shambles of white fragile
3747120	3753760	shards like i bought a gun uh i'm like i'm planning and just doomsday prepping in a desert
3753760	3757600	i don't know how i'm gonna die of thirst like digging a hole straight down because i play
3757600	3767200	minecraft um i i like like like and and like i so it's it's like i look back on like a a 10 year
3767760	3774000	uh history of using the phrase burning man as a comedy writer to like you know mean hippie and
3774000	3779840	dippy and whatever just like make fun or whatever like and and now it's like because of this year
3779840	3784160	it's like this is something that i gotta go to at some point you would definitely obviously recommend
3784160	3789120	it right like like maybe not to everybody but you you wouldn't go seven times if you
3789120	3792480	you weren't getting something out of it you're not like monetizing when you go there no i'm not
3792480	3797280	monetizing at all when i go there incognito and nobody you know like i'm not selling anything
3797280	3801600	there oh you don't even perform there i do perform there i do perform there i'll perform my songs and
3801600	3807280	my set and um you know it'll be a lot of fun but it's not something that i'm like banking on or
3807280	3811120	being like follow my website you know it's like not like that it's sharing what you've been working
3811120	3815600	on all like your art for the year you know and bringing that out and making sure that your
3815600	3820320	friends and family and people get to be touched by it like however they can but i definitely
3820320	3826960	recommend going i think it's an amazing spiritual journey and um and if you need it for you know
3826960	3832720	it can really open new windows of perception for anybody who goes really changes how do you
3832720	3839600	i'm sorry uh did uh how much did that guy's death like affect the rest of the proceedings there
3839600	3846400	or like did it cast a total pall over it or was did it kind of move along it was kind of dark um
3847520	3852160	just from my experience which i mean i'm not like on the inner circles of that of the burn and what's
3852160	3857440	going on in there so you know it it the news came to me in passing and it was just like really
3857440	3862480	strange but um and a lot of people like knew about it but were not talking about it you know
3862480	3867120	because they didn't want that dark dismal like black stain on their week you know but at the
3867120	3870880	same time then you go to the temple burn the next night and there's this like gigantic fence
3870880	3875200	and it's like up around it and i've never seen that before like a fence and they're like nobody
3875200	3883440	is jumping in this damn fire what's the oh so wait so just so the is there a fire multiple nights
3884080	3888720	okay there's lots of fire okay but there's one there's there's the one big burning man
3889600	3893840	or the man burns so like that's not the end of everything everyone doesn't end that and go like
3893840	3899680	jesus christ i got a powerpoint tomorrow oh somebody does i think because people like leave
3899680	3903920	people leave but burning like that's that saturday night that's like the biggest and best party
3903920	3908160	of the week and then sunday usually people are like leaving all day and then leaving all night
3908160	3912800	and the temple burn is like a really quiet and like spiritual experience for people like people
3912800	3917360	don't like talk through it stand up through it this is a joke but also it's probably true so
3917360	3923680	it's like comic-con like sunday's like yeah exactly there's just like comic-con yeah lots
3923680	3930640	of costumes lots of weirdos and freaks uh see like i i'm not a big fan of major crowds and a
3930640	3936240	lot of dirt it seems like a lot of dirt and crowds it's like dust but yeah dust but also
3936240	3940560	what was the temperature because it was bloody hot during that time right um yeah it was hot
3940560	3945680	it was really hot like 120 like what was it it was crazy i don't know it was it was really hot
3945680	3951280	it was like dry heat it was hot at night too it usually gets like really cold at night but this
3951280	3955200	year is like really hot at night and so like you're trying to like get dressed to go out at night
3955200	3960080	because at night it's like a different place it's like it's like you're going to you know antartica
3960080	3963920	for the night or something just hanging out in the snow um and so you're like i gotta put on my
3963920	3968240	heaviest shit and my my brightest things because it's like pitch black and then so when the nights
3968240	3974640	would roll around i'd be like is it a pants night should i put a shirt on what do i do here every
3974640	3982320	night's a pants night give me a beat yeah do we have a beat can you guys do like a duet like
3982320	3987360	like maybe i yeah kick it back and forth freestyle that's why i wanted like kind of a lazy beat like

4668480	4673920	an apartment building okay so oh so it what so when you say inside job literally like someone
4673920	4679360	someone who lives in yeah and so i think it was the russians but that's better than i thought you
4679360	4683280	were seriously parked on the street and then you'd have to feel guilty about that for the
4683280	4686720	rest of your life no no i parked on the street because i was just gonna run in and then someone
4686720	4693040	took my my clicker opened the garage went in and had a field day no but no you're an innocent too
4693040	4699520	you can't control when another human being that is allowed past all of the security measures is
4699520	4705440	going to be a crazy car shouldn't it be easy to investigate then i mean like it's just one
4705440	4711680	building of suspects right well there are cameras they called the i don't know i would also and i'm
4711680	4719200	suspecting like that's a good 10 episodes of a netflix original oh yeah it's called the building
4719200	4724240	dan you have enough you have enough on your plate right now you've already sprained one pinky
4724240	4730640	ed harris made one mistake it's just because i'm the only one who's lifted his head while beating
4730640	4736240	rodney king now i'm in charge of apartment building the car thievery but one job was gonna
4736240	4744480	change everything whoa this is a crazy job let's throw a car Netflix presents
4744480	4750080	a show with a trailer that follows the 90s trailer trope
4753120	4753840	in a world
4756080	4763200	yo 90s trailers they got that voice and says in a world where you stole a car
4764400	4768880	drink a jar all right get back to the i'm not that interesting talk
4769520	4771520	uh
4772960	4778960	dan and spencer shot a fun harman quest commercial this week that was a highlight real fun oh yeah
4778960	4787040	harmon quest is coming to verve next week this week this week it's twice as expensive as see so
4787040	4789760	and twice as likely to stick around for a year
4789760	4799280	here i didn't i didn't ask for this new world any more than you did like try trying to look
4799280	4805440	at it this way like see so was a kickstarter and thank you for your five dollar like commitment
4805440	4811120	to their experiment which was noble and gave like cameron and ria show and like like like
4811120	4816400	like a bunch of a bunch of really cool shows on see so and then it like i did you know i don't
4816480	4819680	think this is a controversial statement i don't think universal gave it enough of a chance you
4819680	4823840	can't that that business model needs five years but they had their own reasons they fucking folded
4823840	4828720	it that's not your problem or but it's a little bit mine because like now we have this world
4828720	4832240	where it's like guys like me are like i gotta build an audience and i am i gonna keep coming
4832240	4836000	to you and going here's another person to subscribe to i i don't want to do that to
4836000	4842400	you that's not what robin hood does he doesn't go hey mary men uh uh i want to introduce you to
4842400	4849600	gerald of knottingham he's uh he's got a real fun business plan for every bottle of shampoo you
4849600	4856080	sell uh three people underneath you sell six bottles and that's that's not the robin hood
4856080	4860320	myth we want are we finding out that harmon quest isn't good enough to make it to like an adult swim
4860320	4868000	oh yeah for sure i mean it's kind of the fact that we're not already on one of those networks
4868720	4876560	implies that we did not make it onto one of those networks right yeah but now i i but there's our
4876560	4881840	show is good enough to be on that but compared i i think there's an alternate reality where we did
4881840	4886320	go to adult swim or something similar but you know but now but now adult swim doesn't need us to
4886320	4891120	because we're making it for free for two seasons that becomes so big and with such a success
4891120	4895200	adult swim can come along scoop it up and and and they're going to be like the heroes
4895280	4898560	but they didn't do anything yeah i mean well yeah and i don't even know the particulars of the deal
4898560	4902800	but the i mean we didn't have we didn't have what among our options wasn't like we're going
4902800	4907200	to keep our show and like go because right yeah we would just do it on the internet sell it for a
4907200	4911600	dollar an episode but we that's not the business works like like we couldn't have produced that
4911600	4917200	level of show uh if see so didn't exist like they had the budget to give us to like do it like
4917200	4922320	dinner for five fucking style and have an audience and the camera's going whooshy whoosh and
4922400	4926880	and lizzie olson's on it and fucking it's it's it's a good show because it's a little higher
4926880	4932240	production value than if we did it on our own but uh the upside of that or the downside or the side
4932240	4938240	side of that is like okay so see so they're they're folded they sold all their shit to verve
4938800	4944960	verve is huge fans they love the show they're like my favorite bands uh right so you know and
4944960	4949360	then i go to you guys and i go hey it's 1199 a month now like what do you guys are like how
4949360	4954240	is this gonna happen how does this end am i just in a bunker with you giving you $50 a month
4954240	4959040	for your pee that's why this season we're asking you not to watch harmon west
4960640	4966160	we're tired of it we're not being complicit any longer look our show let's just be honest our
4966160	4973520	show is on dialysis and we need your money uh yeah for the first season but i also think they
4973520	4976880	well yeah they made the first season available you can't like check out the second season right
4977520	4982320	there might be i i would not be surprised if the first episode of the second season is free but i'm
4982320	4987920	not sure that sounds right it's a good episode though we got gillian jacobs and oh boy i don't
4987920	4993200	want to say she was like very what the fuck but it was great why i cleaned out my how do you even
4993200	4998480	have that much money it's just these are singles but what are you doing no these are this is half
4998480	5002960	of the singles in my underwear oh okay are you going to jumbo's later what's happening
5003200	5007920	okay why did you choose to take them out of your door maybe someone come up i don't know
5008560	5012640	and maybe it has it's like well if anybody feels like did you want to make it rain
5015920	5019600	if you give everyone here one dollar i think i might be no i probably couldn't
5021680	5029440	but i could try this audience is desperate for dollars or you give someone all the money
5029440	5035040	but they have to answer three riddles oh why don't i just do why don't i just do what i do
5035840	5039920	for trick or treat which is i'll put a plate at the front of the stage
5041440	5046480	with a sign that says just take one and i'll put one of these dollars on it
5046480	5051440	and fucking sleep like a baby because then you see the empty plate and you're like fuck society
5052880	5055680	this this nice man left a bunch of money on a plate
5055680	5064400	no one ever appreciates that did you really do that what yeah like you
5064400	5068080	can put it this is a trick or treat trick look if you didn't have time to go buy candy put
5068080	5072800	an empty bucket outside your door and put a sign that says like like like high road the fucking
5072800	5080400	kids and go i i go like be honest just take one and then and then and then the kid gets
5080480	5081920	here's the thing it's a victimless crime
5084880	5090640	the first kid the first kid if there's a kid that's like goes trick or treating at 3 15 p.m
5090640	5097040	fuck that kid he but also he's like a red pillar like he he knows he's like this fucking dude's
5097040	5101120	pulling a scam like there's nobody here before me okay fine that kid goes off and goes a serial
5101120	5107520	killer that every kid after that every kid after that goes up to the bucket sees an empty bucket
5107520	5113200	and a sign that says let's try to be nice people huh and an empty bucket and the kid goes like you
5113200	5118000	know what i love that there's a guy here that thought society was worth a shit too bad it wasn't
5118000	5124880	i'm gonna move on through my day go get some other candy victimless crime um i got two things okay so
5124880	5129520	for the first one is isn't it just fine to not have any candy and stuff like is that something
5129520	5133280	like will people shame you or anything like that is that something well i have a lockable gate at
5133280	5137680	the front of my estate now so this isn't really an issue anymore well i just mean you know you
5137680	5144000	just hit a button shaped like a bat and fucking turrets like pointed the kids you have 10 seconds
5144000	5152160	to expect less did you fear your tree's getting teepee'd right yeah like what's the what's the
5152160	5156480	downside of not just not having candy that's pretty standard if they're gonna teepee my
5156480	5159200	trees first of all they're only hurting my gardener uh
5164480	5168560	second of all and i'll put that on the note yeah what i like about you is their front door
5168560	5171440	the more success that you achieve the more relatable you become
5173280	5179520	i'm not trying to be relatable anymore man i'm just trying to be honest brother you
5179520	5185280	you've become a man of the people i love that i'm salt of the earth now uh it's a salt a big
5185360	5189920	a big big a big salt of the earth orbiting the earth on a military-grade platform
5191600	5193200	hoarding the oxygen it steals
5195360	5198480	i thought you were saying i thought you were saying that you were you you have you put a
5198480	5203200	bowl out with a one dollar bill in it and said please just take one and then some kids oh fuck
5203760	5208720	somebody got all the money right well i am saying oh yeah yeah i mean it's an interesting twist is
5208720	5211920	you have one piece of candy you put it in the bucket and it's the last one left see how long
5211920	5216800	it lasts yeah but if you have that kind of time buy a bag of candy right it would be hard to get
5216800	5223520	one piece of candy i'm not what about being cruel i'm not like a weird monster well yeah but you
5223520	5227600	mean like you have like you have like two like like full-size snickers in there and says please
5227600	5231600	just take one but you have a camera rig like the way they take a picture of you and you're
5231600	5236400	going down splash mountain and so the kid walks away with two snickers and he's got a picture of
5236400	5242000	him but he also gets to buy that picture if he wants look i'll tell you what man
5243440	5247360	once you get over 30 it's like the pressure it gets out unless you live in a really specific
5247360	5251120	neighborhood that's like designed for people to buy the house because it looks like a house where
5251120	5254720	they can't wait to give out candy a trick-or-treat and design for the parents who drop their kids off
5254720	5260400	at that cul-de-sac like like like every other place in los angeles it's like it's you start to like
5260400	5265680	it becomes an exercise and and the fucking like primatological like like anxiety like you open the
5265680	5273120	door and there's like a 15 year old dude like like that put like a uh uh fucking uh ski cap
5273120	5277680	on his head because that's his costume and he's like holding his shirt out going give me candy
5277680	5284960	and you're like jesus christ don't kill me like it's a big city man there's no charm to trick-or-treat
5284960	5290000	like it's kind of like the purge now i just kind of like ethan hawk into my bedroom and watch
5290000	5295200	through a camera i say this halloween we just break into Steve's roommate's car and put all
5295200	5300160	our candy in there and the kids have to go in and like kind of pretend to break into that car
5300160	5306800	did i ever share the story of of uh when i was like me and my friend my best friend ramstack we
5306800	5312320	were uh like we were like i think we were like 11 or 12 and we were like we were kind of doing
5312320	5318320	that we were like we put some like dirt on our face so we had hobo costumes and uh like and we
5318320	5322720	were like going and trick-or-treating like free candy like we're and then like here comes jenny
5322800	5329760	vote who like is like you know the the crush of my life and grade school and she's like walking
5329760	5333520	and she's got this like little girl with her like maybe a little sister is dressed like an
5333520	5339120	astronaut or a princess or something and uh and uh and and so it's jenny vote and i got like
5339120	5343440	soot on my face and i'm with her and i'm like hey what's what's going on and she's like yeah what
5343440	5349600	are you you trick-or-treating i'm like yeah are you and she's like well she is oh she was like
5349600	5355200	i'm just fucking like you know chaperoning because she was a grown-up because she was my age
5355200	5362080	and i was like that's like one of those big moments where like yeah the girls grow up fast
5362080	5368800	and then you're like i'm a fucking i'm the worst i was a worst person at that at that age we would
5368800	5375840	go up at the top of the steep hill and take the pumpkins from people's front yards and then spray
5375840	5382160	him like like aqua spray paint and light them on fire and roll them downhill and it's pretty
5382160	5388240	scary when you see a jack-o-lantern coming at you on fire but then the problem that you know the
5389520	5397360	the bad part of that is that at the end there's a house and a flaming incendiary device is going
5397360	5401600	into the juniper tree in their front yard and gonna kill everybody at the end of it is a whole
5401600	5406640	society that's just like oh so you kids just don't give a fuck like i i feel so bad about being a
5406640	5410720	kid now like we used to just like throw shit at cars like we didn't get it we thought we were the
5410720	5416960	goonies do did we talk about window tapping with the penny and the tape do we ever talk about this
5416960	5422640	uh wait my penny tap no window tapping penny tapping we called it penny tapping yeah did you
5422640	5429200	tell me about this yeah that's fucking that's some sinister shit yeah but that's like the
5429200	5433520	most benign thing of all yeah but it's that is beauty torture i know but at least yeah well you
5433520	5437440	know what now that i think about it but it's it's it but it's because you're you're you're you're
5437440	5440960	implying to a person that someone's tapping on their windows so it's like and now you look at
5440960	5444240	it through a modern lens you're like that's a horrible thing to do to somebody but we were
5444800	5449840	it was the 80s so we thought well they will think it's like slender man i i was like like i i didn't
5450320	5456640	i i was invented in 2013 is shut up you fucking uncreative shitty generation

5677760	5683520	long time and we're trying to make it work and it did you know it's it she was like

5702560	5709520	whatever wait wait i i'm not i that was a joke right are you no no i mean like i i thought it
5710400	5715040	that's like a joke that a writer would write that's a joke no i know he's taking this time
5715040	5720880	around this time around they didn't give it oh okay oh yeah no we it's like i it was always
5720880	5726480	like unrequited but our friendship like just got stronger and stronger until we were able to
5726480	5730960	finally cross a threshold and then this summer was like let's try let's actually try to have a
5731600	5734000	a relationship well you know what steve let's bring her out
5734720	5737840	uh put your hands together

5766720	5772720	like like in my in my day like that would that's that just goes right into the misogyny engine
5772720	5777680	because the way to recover from that like sure is like you get bit by a snake you rub it in dirt
5777680	5782000	or whatever like you do and that's a bad example i don't know anything i don't know anything about
5782000	5787280	primal medicine can we put a pin in that thump all right it's like you know how like you you burn
5787280	5791600	your thumb and then you shove it in your mouth and it's like probably that's not helping as much
5791600	5795520	as some other counterintuitive thing like you're supposed to pee on it or let a bee lick it i don't
5795520	5803600	know but like you you millennials you're a millennial right you're 40 uh the the the like

5997280	6002080	it's treacherous goings
6005920	6011680	no what happened uh we we fought some bandits we left with the uh with pachins right leaving
6011680	6020320	the church with pachins banditos attacked and they got him the end i'm still unconscious right
6020320	6026640	did we lose pachins pachins is gone uh that's a great question to ask in character
6028160	6033360	well we we know that that the uh that the prior boned out he decamped he left us because he wanted
6033360	6038400	yeah so you're at the campground one of one of the guys one of the guys dan touched with his
6038400	6043760	inflict wounds and he kind of wit withered that guy's kind of hobbling away and then there's
6043760	6048960	another guy who you clubbed his he clubbed him in the head and he kind of just went down cold
6048960	6054400	the rest of the banditos have kind of escaped at this point and uh they made off with pachins
6054400	6058240	clothes they took pachins clothes but i took some clothes off another dead guy and put them on
6058240	6065600	pachins i go up to pachins pachins can you hear me how are you uh oh my god
6067440	6069040	i'm stabbed
6070800	6073840	pachin is your character so important to our story that i should heal you
6073840	6080880	these are the questions you have to ask that his pachins i'll answer that
6081600	6086960	these are the moral questions you've got to decide i i have a little ptsd from fighting
6086960	6093840	these for those banditos that's in real life and you wear my clothes some other guy took him but
6093840	6100240	you're wearing a banditos jesus crow oh my god he starts sobbing inconsolably he's like he's
6100320	6106080	thrashing around and like clawing at the soil i'm gonna fix this can i i i i want to follow
6106080	6112000	the hobbling uh bandito okay he's slower right yeah so i'm gonna go grab him all right you're
6112000	6117520	just grabbing him well if i can yeah yeah well if i may yeah no i mean there's there's a lot of
6117520	6124080	ways to approach the guy but yeah that works okay so i'm sorry you rolled it too you do not grab him
6124320	6132080	um yeah no you definitely don't grab him but he's still just hobbling away so you can essentially
6132080	6139200	try yeah i i walk i walk up to passions and i cure light wounds okay uh light wounds that's 1d8
6139200	6144960	all right he heals eight damage uh he's he's uh most of his wounds are starting to scab over
6144960	6151920	but he's not like completely healed and he's still just you know i don't know it insane almost
6152080	6158320	um you want to grab him again do you want to do something i think i'm unconscious oh yeah that's
6158320	6163600	true oh steve you're dreaming you're dreaming about that same door that rob shrub's version of
6163600	6171040	you is dreaming about yeah yeah carlos we got we got bigger fish to fry here our friend uh
6171040	6177040	diarrhea junior here he's got a demon mist inside and we got to help this guy i don't have time to
6177040	6183360	explain but a lot of uh of uh medicine has to do with state of mind and he needs to confront his
6183360	6192240	uh tormentor who does who has to confront who patches i'll be right there okay i just i rolled
6192240	6199200	the two all right yeah i'd be back already okay i got you all right you grab him this time all right
6199680	6207440	drag him over all right he is still armed so he yeah he doesn't he doesn't stab you but he he's
6207440	6211120	if you don't like really restrain him like you're you're like grappling with him you know but if you
6211120	6216880	don't really restrain him he might keep stabbing you by the hair and i and i and i i you know i
6216880	6222960	say in a in a very convicted voice because the truth is my character in these moments is convicted
6222960	6230560	about these kinds of things i say if you one more time make the wrong decision about about
6231280	6239680	who you're trying to harm i i will kill you and that will be the beginning of your misery okay
6242240	6248480	um i'm an expert on these things there is a silver flame that guides us and it will make
6248480	6255440	an example of you um do you have uh do you have intimidate or diplomacy but isn't it isn't it more
6255440	6260960	intimidating if i don't have those things i'm like you know like how many times are we the
6260960	6267600	victims of a charming bully they usually have like bad grammar and okay let me look sorry there's a
6267680	6274720	whole stack of papers and i the mrs and i were recently and
6277600	6288480	other side okay great well looking for intimidate diplomacy intimidate no that's zero and diplomacy
6288480	6293600	there's a check mark okay great um but no numbers right you do have it it's just not measurable
6294400	6294880	well yeah
6297760	6304560	same could be true of all this you definitely scare him he's like jesus oh boy that's a bad
6304560	6311360	oh yeah okay yeah you're at a fork in your life you were a bandito now you're a hostage
6312880	6316480	your behavior as a hostage could lead you to the main road of humanity
6317680	6321040	something you departed when you became a bandito probably your dad's fault
6321200	6324880	okay i'm your new dad i'm taking you back
6326800	6331280	well you don't have to be a hostage forever you could die a hostage or you could spend a time as
6331280	6335120	a hostage proving that you're a human all right what's your perception
6339600	6344240	it it's not checked and then there's a it says total bonus and there's a three in parentheses
6344240	6355680	perfect i'm that perceptive all right okay so now obviously come on you just asked me what
6355680	6360080	my perception was and now you're saying nothing right well so how is it i'm not what is this
6361040	6366240	paranoid now huh what didn't i perceive yeah what didn't you perceive i pull his hair i go
6366240	6371600	what am i not perceiving here what are you talking about what are you doing i look at his hand he
6371600	6377920	swallows hard you dirty shitty person i walk over i i have 11 perception let me try
6379440	6384560	carlos what are we trying to perceive he swallowed something open up drop it drop it he opens his
6384560	6391760	mouth if i reach in and pull his jaw open yeah yeah yeah i would pull it drop it drop it drop
6391760	6395920	what spit it out he doesn't have anything in his mouth he just swallowed nervously i think he
6395920	6403120	wasn't swallowing the microfilm alternately if you swallow something it no longer remains in your
6403120	6412960	mouth i i i i punch him in the stomach all right i'm trying to i i i i i have induced vomit
6414480	6418640	give him the heimlich like you get like like hold him upside down go old school on this guy
6419840	6423920	all right well you punch him in the stomach but it doesn't make him throw up he just takes a couple
6424000	6427520	damn it he swallowed some all right well it doesn't you know what it doesn't matter i i only
6427520	6429920	brought him over here for one thing it's not like we're on an adventure where we need to know where
6429920	6435600	the treasure is i i just like patchens patchens look over here look i just want to watch patchens
6435600	6442960	watch him die that's that's oh um patchens isn't isn't really he's still he's just face down in
6442960	6447600	the dirt kind of like just flopping and flailing someone lift patchens head take a look i can watch
6447600	6452000	this guy die i pick up the bandito by the feet and shake him and try to get whatever was he swallowed
6452000	6457360	okay then i grabbed patchens head and pointed so that he's watching the guy die okay and i whisper
6457360	6463920	in his ear like it's okay like like the people that hurt you get hurt more in what's wait okay
6463920	6470080	are you gonna kill him though patchens no no the guy no he's gonna die he's going to die i want to
6470080	6474400	shake him upside down and make him cough up whatever he had how is he going uh okay well
6474400	6479360	that doesn't work okay i invent the heimlich maneuvering him the heimlich maneuvering all right
6479520	6490400	all right well yeah um i i see it yeah i don't even know how do you critically fail a bit
6490400	6497840	about non heimlich yeah is it a good heimlich or so i smash his sternum well yeah you can hear
6497840	6504320	ribs cracking as you give him the heimlich maneuver and after way too many attempts he finally starts
6504320	6510240	to choke something up and it gets lodged in his throat and it dies pachins pachins watch see
6510240	6517840	pachins see see the will of the eternal flame pachins is like still for a moment and then he
6517840	6524480	just starts like thrashing an overdrive it's okay i i reach in and grab the thing that i kind of
6524480	6530720	perceive with my 11 perception that he choked up he choked on it looks like a big weird pill oh
6530880	6538560	oh i uh i examine the pill it looks big and weird and a little bit dissolved but only a little tiny
6538560	6543040	bit oh so he was trying to take his own life he was trying to like herman gearing his way out of
6543040	6548320	not standard bandito protocol yeah what why what do these guys have to hide they want to take their
6548320	6565360	own lives perhaps these banditos no more than we know should we search him uh you can sure pachins
6565360	6573120	you okay he's he's just screaming he's saying i can't believe it's god oh my god i have one job
6573120	6578720	oh my god what is it oh my god he's like he's he's clutching at you you know like when someone's
6578720	6584400	like hysterical with with with pain and agony you don't know what they're doing like he's doing
6584400	6589680	that and he's like just kind of slapping you like he's i don't know and uh you can at some point you
6589680	6594240	figure out what he's doing is he's trying to grab like a knife out of your wallet and stuff like
6594240	6600960	he's trying to grab a knife from you pachins why do you want my knife he um he doesn't grab it
6600960	6606400	he just grabs at it and he's just like i can't i can't handle this pachins you gotta tell me what
6606400	6617840	what you lost i i had they gave me i was sent to ron for one reason just to keep this thing safe
6617840	6623440	it's like i don't know what it is it's like a treasure sacred treasure i don't know i don't
6623440	6629200	know what does it look like it's like uh like the it's like a big big gem like the most beautiful
6629200	6636720	jewel you've ever seen and all i was supposed to do was just lay low and you know hide and
6636720	6641680	i figured after there was all those boogens i should probably relocate but fuck wait did
6641680	6646880	one of the banditos just take that jewel that you had on you uh well my clothes is gone and i'm
6646880	6651600	stamped up we gotta get those banditos i thought this was just a pachins why don't you tell us you
6651600	6656880	had precious jewel treasures on you before the boogens came up because i'm not supposed to tell
6656880	6662160	anybody that's part of the whole thing if you couldn't steal it you could be you know agents of
6662800	6671280	shield i i grabbed the bandito that's that's that's there that just was he dead uh that one
6671280	6676480	that was the choking one yeah he's dead yeah are there any live live banditos there's one that's of
6676480	6683440	indeterminate status he's he's he's got a caved-in helmet um i search him to see if he's got the
6684160	6690320	other guys ran off with the gem right for sure yeah so we fucked up i searched i searched that
6690320	6696880	guy anyway yeah okay you search him you find uh what do you find you find under his regular
6696880	6703840	bandito clothes he has very finely crafted studded leather armor it's very quiet and stealthy it seems
6703840	6710240	like it was meant to be hidden underneath normal clothes what's what size is he uh he's a human
6710240	6716160	he's a human yeah a little big for me yeah shit and then you also see a dagger he's got a dagger
6716160	6723200	and a short sword and they both seem of incredibly fine make like um like masterwork weapons you
6723200	6728640	don't even know who made them but it was a real real master well i'm small i take that dagger and
6728640	6734560	i give this who wants this awesome sword you guys are sword peoples i don't know i don't use blades
6734560	6739360	i'm gonna i will check the dead guy i want to see if that's the same thing are these guys all like
6740080	6744480	yeah you search him too and you get the same thing so i didn't quite finish so i'll just
6744480	6749840	so there's also a poison pill in the one who didn't take a poison pill's pocket and then one
6749840	6755920	of them has a little note but it's it's like with like script and symbols and runes and stuff it's
6755920	6760960	it doesn't seem like any written language it seems like a code except as someone with knowledge
6760960	6769600	arcana it's clearly not magical it's uh it's just uh it's just a normal code it's knowledge
6769600	6776400	history do you have how many points do you have in knowledge history it's a check mark but
6777040	6785200	but no points okay you recognize it is it seems to use a basic uh a basic standard of symbology
6785200	6791280	used in uh the guilds for trading purposes so it's like a symbolic symbolic language that's
6791280	6796960	not exactly like for speaking it's not like the you know it's not common or anything it's just
6796960	6802480	like its own language uh but that's the only thing you only recognize the symbols like you
6802480	6806320	don't actually know what they mean and you couldn't read it if you wanted knowledge nobility
6806320	6819600	all right nobility occasionally learns that symbol language knowledge religions
6822640	6829520	some religions disagree with that symbol language linguistics i don't think you have
6829520	6836000	knowledge linguistics i do check mark linguistics do you have any points in it no i don't point in
6836000	6845440	any of this shit fucking second third level fucking like look it's i know this this language
6847280	6852240	it's a trading language these people aren't banditos they're stockbrokers
6854800	6862000	i i take that dagger i take the symbols written on a note uh yeah okay i take that note and then
6862080	6870560	i take the poison pill and i put it i put it in his mouth and then i say where are your friends
6870560	6877200	staying and i won't make you swallow this pill who are you saying that to the guy to the bandito
6877200	6882880	which one the one that's not dead they're both dead they're both dead i take his dagger just
6882880	6888320	stab him eight times oh man it's no good i'm just just testing out the strength of the dagger it's
6888320	6895200	it slides through easily all right as if it's uh magically sharp these guys weren't regular
6895200	6900880	banditos and they've got they've got pachin's precious gem yeah but we've also got a sick
6900880	6906960	diarrhea on right he's dying over here he's got that mist i think the mist went into the keyhole
6906960	6911440	in his heart and he's infected with some sort of horrible demonic business yeah we got it we got
6911440	6916000	to get him to the church i kind of get him to the church but no we got to get pachin's gem back
6916000	6924640	but what if at the expense of killing dj what sorry we should go to dj's dream probably is
6924640	6932800	that okay yeah there's a door there's sounds behind it you don't know what they are can i open
6932800	6941200	the door do you want to you don't know until you try okay i i put my ear against the door to listen
6942080	6946560	what is it what give me some of those sounds as you're putting your ear to the door like there's
6946560	6950960	just a big smash on the door like someone's beating against it it really spooks you out
6950960	6956720	and then it's followed by like do i have my weapons uh no you're naked i'm naked yeah it's a dream
6961120	6968320	ride or die i guess open the door all right as you touch the door and it opens or the the door
6968320	6973520	kind of disappears and just behind it is blackness and the blackness kind of spreads up your body and
6973520	6979200	you become consumed by the darkness and you wake up in a cold sweat like i'm i'm actually awake now
6979200	6985680	yeah yeah you're awake awake holy shit what the fuck you've been stabbed multiple times what
