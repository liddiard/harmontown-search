10000	12000	Make some noise!
12000	14000	Music
14000	16000	So happy to see you, Burbank!
16000	18000	Harleytown is now in possession!
18000	20000	We have a very special guest tonight!
20000	22000	We have a special guest tonight!
22000	26000	Sitting in for a spin to rip this!
26000	28000	It's Steve!
28000	32000	Music
32000	34000	We miss you so much, Jeff Davis!
34000	36000	Nobody's more than me!
36000	39000	Robbie's sitting here, my name is Brent Johnson!
39000	47000	Let's bring up the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
47000	51000	Cheering
51000	53000	Thank you, thank you very much.
53000	57000	I don't have any notes, I don't have any, there's no show, there's no show tonight.
57000	61000	But it's a beautiful summer night, thank you for coming out to Burbank.
61000	66000	If you were here last week, we started, we're zeroing in on the 8 o'clock start time.
66000	70000	This time I believe it was our fault, I think we walked up at 8 o'clock.
70000	72000	So I don't think we could have started the show sooner.
72000	77000	We're battening down the hatches, if that's what you do on a ship when you're making it a better ship.
77000	82000	I think that's not what you do, I think that's what you do when a short ship storm is coming.
82000	84000	Yeah!
84000	86000	Welcome, Steve.
86000	87000	Thank you.
87000	89000	Yeah, big shoes to fill.
89000	92000	Just keep judging me.
92000	94000	Yeah, sorry, Spencer's not here.
94000	96000	I'll tell you some things about Spencer since he's not here.
96000	100000	He's usually, he's a libertarian.
100000	105000	He voted for, that misfired.
105000	110000	So it's 30% of my viewership, listenership.
110000	113000	Yeah, I was gonna say he's a Republican, but I thought it was too arch a joke.
113000	114000	Yeah.
114000	117000	So I tried to make something funnier, like if somebody says, how old is it?
117000	119000	And then you could go like, oh, 85.
119000	121000	It's funnier to say 27.
121000	122000	Unless he's 85.
122000	124000	Spencer's 85.
124000	130000	And a Republican, a Nazi Republican, not even like a log cabin, like supportive of gay people
130000	138000	because it makes fiscal sense Republican, like a fucking hardcore master race Republican.
138000	142000	And he hates the fans, hates them, doesn't like them.
142000	144000	Isn't grateful for them.
144000	146000	He considers them a pox.
146000	152000	And he doesn't, he likes dungeons a little bit, hates dragons.
152000	155000	Never uses dice.
155000	159000	And we got, I moved into this new space because people kept saying I would come in from out of town.
159000	161000	I want to see Spencer.
161000	166000	So I lifted him up and put him over there, put a mannequin behind him.
166000	168000	But now he can't show up because you know why?
168000	170000	You know where he is?
171000	173000	He's whale hunting.
173000	180000	He's out hunting whales for sport, not even for oil.
180000	182000	He's hunting whales for sport.
182000	190000	Do you know where he gets the oil for his whale harpoon gun, which uses twice as much oil as a whale generates?
190000	191000	Zebra.
191000	196000	He uses zebra oil to hunt whales for sport.
196000	199000	Did you tell him about the puppy dress he made?
200000	201000	Didn't even wear it.
201000	203000	With his ivory sewing machine?
206000	208000	Conflict ivory?
209000	211000	Not regular free range.
211000	215000	The elephant knows it's been raised to give ivory ivory.
215000	220000	Like actual fucking like there's a Gaza strip of the ivory poachers.
220000	228000	And I know this is challenging for you, but there's two kinds of poachers, and one is technically relatively the other kind, the good kind of poacher.
228000	230000	And Spencer is not on their side.
230000	232000	He exploits them.
232000	239000	The poacher you'd feel sorry for if you were sealed in a room with only poachers and had only known them, that's the poacher that he exploits.
239000	240000	Right.
240000	241000	All right.
241000	244000	Well, so be thankful he's not here is my point.
244000	247000	It's just little old me with his lack of a show.
247000	248000	Oh, boy.
248000	250000	Let's go to Burbank and pay.
250000	251000	What is it?
251000	252000	Five dollars now?
252000	253000	Man, I snuck in.
253000	255000	Seventy five dollars?
255000	257000	Oh, they're they're creeping it up.
259000	268000	I thought five dollars was like, like, look, it'll be half price, like half what they paid at Meltdown, and then we can be twice as bad and you'll break even.
268000	270000	How much was that drink?
272000	273000	Okay, we'll see.
274000	276000	It was an optional dollar.
276000	277000	It was an optional dollar.
277000	280000	Yeah, it cost you a dollar because there was a jar that made you feel guilty.
282000	285000	The cost of being a human is a dollar.
285000	287000	The drink was free.
287000	289000	Otherwise, we're under arrest.
289000	290000	It's the harm of town.
290000	291000	Speak easy.
292000	293000	But thank you.
293000	294000	Thank you.
294000	295000	You're welcome here, sir.
295000	297000	You're not miked, but you're welcome here.
299000	300000	All right.
300000	301000	Well, yeah, I mean, I've spent.
301000	302000	See, I've been doing this thing.
302000	307000	I ran in last minute because I but this is really valuable for me.
307000	312000	I I started making these little garage band songs and music videos and putting them on Instagram.
312000	316000	And I've been very it's been very therapeutic for me because it's not something I'm supposed to be good at.
316000	317000	I'm not a musician.
317000	318000	Nope.
318000	319000	Wrong.
319000	320000	I am.
320000	320000	
320000	321000	No, no, no.
321000	322000	I'm just making these goofy little songs.
322000	331000	I'm using only the free software and and only using my phone and and my my little ear pod ear earbud.
331000	334000	Microphone and anything that exceeds that.
334000	337000	I'm like because I want it to be a hobby, not a profession.
337000	339000	So I'm not supposed to be good at it.
339000	340000	So it was very relaxing to me.
340000	345000	I was having a really good time and I was churning out these amazing little hits.
345000	346000	We cannot wait.
346000	347000	These little.
347000	348000	We cannot wait.
348000	349000	He's quite a wordsmith.
353000	354000	Oh, shit.
354000	355000	OK, here we go.
355000	356000	World premiere.
356000	360000	It's still my other hobby, which is getting this show to the point where I can just play shit.
360000	363000	I is I'm falling behind in that hobby.
363000	364000	I can't.
364000	365000	It'll take 10 minutes of dead air.
365000	367000	So but but I.
367000	368000	Yeah.
368000	371000	I mean, if you follow me on Instagram, I just make these little ditties about taking poops
371000	373000	and being hungover and stuff.
373000	375000	And so I was having a good time.
375000	379000	It would take about two hours to make the song and then like run around and shoot stuff
379000	381000	like like like me pooping and stuff.
381000	384000	And then I'd like put it together in Luma Fusion.
384000	389000	The iOS is a premier, nonlinear editor.
390000	391000	We lost Brandon.
391000	392000	We lost him.
392000	393000	It's not a good show.
393000	394000	The.
394000	396000	No, you can go do it.
396000	397000	You're going to make a drink.
397000	398000	I'm sorry.
398000	399000	I didn't mean to.
399000	400000	No, it's.
400000	401000	It's all good.
401000	402000	We're fine.
402000	403000	OK.
403000	404000	What?
404000	405000	Oh, oh, he's.
405000	406000	Oh, you're picking the thing to hear the story.
406000	409000	Well, don't pick up bad optics.
409000	410000	All right.
410000	413000	So the the the I saw I'm really relaxed.
413000	414000	I'm happy.
414000	416000	Then Cody gets sick.
416000	418000	She's got like a throat thing or something.
418000	419000	Some kind of throat thing.
419000	422000	And it's like she's quarantined so we can't see each other.
422000	427000	So I'm like I'm going to make.
427000	429000	Thank you, Chris.
429000	430000	He got the phone to work.
430000	432000	Steve Levy is plugging in the phone for you.
432000	433000	Oh, you plugged it.
433000	435000	You plugged in my phone or you plugged in.
435000	436000	It's my phone.
436000	437000	You're on Instagram.
437000	438000	You're a public figure.
438000	439000	That's how it works.
439000	440000	OK.
440000	441000	All right.
441000	442000	That makes sense.
442000	447000	He got that Spencer shit down.
448000	451000	I really I've been watching a lot of Star Trek too.
451000	455000	And it really makes me miss Spencer because the relationship between Kirk and Spock is
455000	462000	not to endow myself as as Kirk, but but like the dynamic between them is is makes me miss
462000	463000	Spencer a lot.
463000	466000	But that show like that show is straight up racist.
466000	472000	But before you could even be regular racist, like in a millennial sense, it was like not
472000	476000	only forget about we'll talk about Nichelle Nichols in a second and the treatment of her
476000	478000	character and all the women.
478000	479000	But but but forget about that.
479000	483000	We don't even we know that the 60s were an unenlightened time and that we are now living
483000	487000	in a Camelot of progression.
487000	492000	Historians will look back on 2017 and say they really understood.
492000	496000	They really got it.
496000	501000	There's going to be a hot dog on our dollar next week.
501000	503000	We might as well just do whatever we want.
503000	507000	No one's ever going to see from history, which is what you were supposed to be through the
507000	511000	canopy of fucking Trump like you might as well do whatever you want down here.
511000	514000	Doop doop doop doop women.
514000	516000	I don't like them.
516000	519000	No, you guys only heard that the aliens will never hear it.
519000	526000	No, they'll they'll they'll be watching him touch a ball with a with a wizard.
526000	532000	I go like these people were fascinated with this man who was so strange and wonderful,
532000	536000	I guess because we are we don't know anything.
536000	540000	DNA only has three letters and all of them are genius.
540000	542000	And so we have no life.
542000	550000	We we sleep for a million years just to make bread because it comes all the way around.
550000	551000	They're like genetically washed out.
551000	559000	We must abduct people and replenish our DNA with ape man and cow anus.
559000	561000	I love this recipe already.
561000	564000	Part ape man, part cow anus.
564000	566000	Try it, blimp flock.
566000	569000	I'm feeling a little feisty.
569000	571000	Like you could make a coffee table book?
571000	573000	No, don't be ridiculous.
573000	577000	I am part of the meme words.
577000	581000	Then keep keep trying and I'll be back with more cow anus.
581000	582000	But we already tried that.
582000	585000	Shut up.
585000	587000	Where was I?
587000	588000	Oh, Star Trek.
588000	589000	Yeah, well, whatever, man.
590000	594000	But I'm saying like that show didn't even know that nonwhite people belonged on TV yet.
594000	597000	And it was still racist because they made up a race called Vulcans.
597000	602000	And all they did was bust his balls the whole show because he only had one thing about him.
602000	604000	He was just like, look, I have one gimmick.
604000	605000	It's kind of easy to understand.
605000	606000	It's sort of my religion.
606000	608000	I have a funny haircut, pointy ears.
608000	611000	And it's associated with the fact that I only deal in logic.
611000	612000	I don't deal in emotion.
612000	614000	And then they're like, OK, got it.
614000	615000	So we understand that.
615000	618000	So at the end of every episode, they'd be like, of course, that was kind of feelings.
619000	620000	Wasn't it, Spock?
620000	622000	And he's like, it's like, why?
622000	625000	He's just like everything on his face is like, like, why do you do this?
625000	627000	Why?
627000	629000	Like, when is this going to get funny?
629000	632000	I can't hear the fucking impish music.
632000	635000	Like, I can only yes and you logically.
635000	637000	I know that's going to make you even funnier.
637000	640000	But like, what if I what what if Spock was just like, you're right.
640000	641000	Come on, guys.
641000	643000	Leave me alone.
643000	645000	And then they'd be like, ew.
645000	647000	And then you hear that like flute, that comedic Star Trek flute.
648000	650000	But then they'd stop respecting him.
650000	651000	Right.
651000	653000	Because he'd stop saving their life all the time.
653000	655000	And he wouldn't be able to throw them through walls.
655000	657000	But I don't know.
657000	659000	That's how we treated exchange students.
659000	661000	Did you have exchange students in your high school?
661000	665000	Like some kid from a they'd go like, this is Andre.
665000	669000	He's from he's from fucking Germany.
669000	672000	I mean, Germany is the easiest to pick on.
672000	676000	Like the German ones were the hardcore jeans would be too short and too tight.
676000	679000	There'd be like one ball hanging out awkwardly.
679000	682000	There was a guy from Barcelona that came to our high school.
682000	684000	I didn't want to say that because I don't want you to think I went to some rich
684000	685000	people's high school.
685000	686000	And I don't know.
686000	689000	It feels like exchange students, like they come from like warmer climates,
689000	693000	maybe a richer or something like I went to a shitty high school like I don't
693000	695000	know why anyone from Barcelona could come to Milwaukee.
695000	700000	But God damn, they must have been so fucking bummed out.
700000	705000	And then and then to be in our little 600 kid high school in this brown deer
705000	706000	Wisconsin.
706000	710000	And the kids were just like so fascinated for the first two weeks.
710000	715000	Like, hey, say this, say, say my balls or whatever.
715000	716000	I think, you know, whatever.
716000	718000	I swear.
718000	723000	I tried to change it from last minute and it didn't work.
723000	725000	Just say, go here.
725000	727000	You know, like, you know, like in your high school, you got you got your little
727000	728000	things.
728000	729000	You go like norb floor.
729000	730000	And that means pussy.
730000	733000	But it also means like the principal's fat or whatever.
733000	734000	You got your codes.
734000	735000	And then so you need the kid.
735000	736000	You say norb face.
736000	738000	Say, hey, Andre, say norb flork.
738000	740000	And he's like, what does this mean?
740000	741000	There's no flork.
741000	742000	Is that just that?
742000	743000	That's already funny.
743000	744000	What does this mean?
744000	747000	This norb flork is that he asked what norb flork is.
747000	748000	That's not actually funny.
748000	751000	That doesn't when you grow up and start practicing comedy, you find that
751000	755000	that doesn't qualify as a joke to confuse someone and for them to seek
755000	756000	clarification.
756000	757000	It's not funny.
757000	759000	It wouldn't work if you saw it on SNL.
759000	760000	They wouldn't.
760000	761000	They wouldn't get.
761000	764000	I'm not saying that's a gold standard, but they wouldn't they wouldn't
764000	767000	they wouldn't say this sketch is ready to go.
767000	768000	Yeah.
768000	769000	Third grade style, like fifth grade jokes.
769000	774000	But then they finally go norb flork and then and then the roof comes off
774000	777000	the school and Andre said norb flork.
777000	780000	And then he says it again, like because either he's going to play ball.
780000	782000	He's like, that was a real norb flork.
782000	784000	And then you're like.
784000	786000	And then and then he's that's how we consume people.
786000	787000	That's what we do.
787000	788000	We're a giant.
788000	789000	We're just a big.
789000	790000	That's what society is.
790000	792000	We're individually we're wonderful people.
792000	793000	We're better than the giraffes.
793000	795000	That's a sound like a broken record.
795000	798000	But the chimpanzee is a beautiful beast.
798000	800000	Like and we are basically chimps.
800000	805000	The thing that we created by becoming the perfect chimp, which is society,
805000	807000	a a byproduct.
807000	809000	I would say a wasteful byproduct at this point.
809000	810000	We're all choking on it.
810000	813000	Society is like carbon monoxide from a car.
813000	814000	Like it's exhaust.
814000	818000	Society has been created around us or let's say access society.
818000	821000	Society, you probably wouldn't complain about if you were running through
821000	825000	the apocalyptic forest and there were people behind you going like, you know,
825000	826000	you don't have a society.
826000	827000	So we're going to kill you.
827000	829000	And then your society came the other direction or through the jungle.
829000	831000	It'd be like, thank God for society.
831000	834000	But that's just gang shit in a jungle.
834000	838000	Then then you start like making things to grind your food instead of it.
838000	842000	And then you cut to, you know, you know, the stuff that we're in right now
842000	845000	where you're like looking at Twitter and you're getting mad because there's a
845000	850000	guy with a shirt that says buck Obama and you're like, you can't square.
850000	851000	You don't know how to swear.
851000	853000	What do you, what do you posh?
853000	857000	You don't want to, you don't want to sully your fucking forebrain with a profanity.
857000	859000	It's a free country.
859000	860000	Say fuck Obama.
860000	866000	You fucking hillbilly nerd.
866000	874000	I wouldn't want to use the F word, but let's just say that person's not human.
874000	879000	Where was I?
879000	882000	Man, I'm stuck on that superior chimp thing.
882000	884000	That was amazing.
884000	889000	But then together we're this biomass and what we do is starting on the playground
889000	892000	we see individuals and we start practicing coalescing.
892000	894000	We go like, oh, what kind of shoes do you have?
894000	895000	I don't know.
895000	896000	What kind of shoes do you have?
896000	897000	Same shoes, same shoes.
897000	898000	Your shoes are too the same.
898000	899000	Well, my shoes will be a little bit different.
899000	900000	Okay.
900000	902000	Well, that person's different shoes are really cool.
902000	903000	And you're forming this little blob.
903000	907000	And then there's the kids, all of whom became my listeners who are in or like
907000	909000	further away from the blob.
909000	911000	There's never going to be any coalescence.
911000	913000	It's going to be, it's like way over here.
913000	918000	So the blob goes like, whoa, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.
918000	921000	Just visiting, not coming over here.
921000	923000	What's with your shoes?
923000	927000	And you go like, I failed to see the logic and why you're asking the shoes.
928000	931000	Energy!
931000	935000	And there was no exchange about shoes at all.
935000	937000	Your sole was just sucked away.
937000	939000	And the blob goes scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot goes away.
939000	942000	Or the suckers go, oh, come on, guys.
942000	946000	I'll try a little harder next time and kind of follow the blob along that they'll
946000	947000	never be a part of.
947000	950000	And like, those are the people like in Blade that have the tattoo in the back of
950000	951000	their neck.
951000	956000	The thralls, the glyph slaves, the familiars.
956000	960000	The Renfords that will then run out into the night or the day time for
960000	962000	Dracula and go do whatever.
962000	964000	Renfroath?
964000	965000	What the hell was that, guys?
965000	966000	Renfield.
966000	967000	Renfield.
967000	968000	That was close.
968000	969000	Oh, shit.
969000	970000	We have a guest.
970000	971000	He's standing over there.
971000	972000	Okay.
972000	974000	What do you want?
974000	976000	Did you schedule anything for me tomorrow?
976000	977000	Yeah.
977000	979000	It's Memorial Day.
979000	980000	Okay.
980000	985000	But I didn't know that when I was asked to schedule that day.
985000	987000	Who asked you to schedule something?
987000	988000	Smalls.
988000	989000	Okay.
989000	991000	That's writing work.
991000	993000	No, not Leonard Smalls.
993000	994000	Who's Leonard Smalls?
994000	997000	I could work with Leonard Smalls if I wanted.
997000	999000	Whoever that is.
999000	1001000	So you want me to cancel?
1001000	1003000	No, because we're way behind on that.
1003000	1005000	Well, maybe, look, I'll...
1005000	1007000	We should do this right now, guys.
1007000	1010000	You have a fun dinner tomorrow night.
1010000	1012000	We should do this right now.
1012000	1013000	Yeah.
1013000	1014000	Because there's no...
1014000	1016000	You know, there's not a guest over there.
1016000	1017000	And people.
1017000	1019000	Fred, I'll break you up in a second.
1019000	1021000	I just got a few calendar items to start out.
1021000	1025000	I want to clear my day tomorrow.
1025000	1027000	Respect for one person's time on stage.
1027000	1029000	It's mine.
1029000	1031000	I'm a real wizard about it.
1031000	1036000	Let's welcome my good old friend Fred Stoller.
1044000	1048000	I'm already all sweaty, so I don't want to, like, hug me.
1048000	1050000	I forgot the water.
1050000	1051000	This is pressure.
1051000	1053000	Well, they told me, just have fun.
1053000	1054000	Yeah.
1054000	1056000	So I'm glad when they remind me to do that,
1056000	1058000	because sometimes they don't.
1058000	1059000	Yeah, yeah.
1059000	1061000	And you come up here and you cry.
1061000	1063000	And you seem like a guy, I've known you a while,
1063000	1066000	and you're always a guy that knows how to just have fun.
1066000	1067000	And go crazy.
1067000	1068000	Yeah.
1068000	1069000	And...
1069000	1070000	All right, yeah.
1070000	1072000	Somebody tells you, like, don't try too hard.
1072000	1073000	Like, you know how to do that.
1073000	1074000	Yeah.
1074000	1075000	I...
1075000	1077000	Well, you were talking about, like, the pressure,
1077000	1079000	because they didn't pay a lot.
1079000	1081000	And when I used to headline in stand-up,
1081000	1082000	which is very brief,
1082000	1086000	I used to feel sorry for the people waiting online to see me.
1086000	1087000	Headline at a comedy club.
1087000	1088000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1088000	1089000	That's not confidence.
1089000	1090000	That's...
1090000	1091000	I mean, yeah.
1091000	1093000	Yeah, you got to really think you're entitled
1093000	1094000	and you're great.
1094000	1098000	So hopefully you could fill up the slack of this.
1099000	1101000	I'm not getting into this.
1101000	1102000	I...
1102000	1103000	Yeah, I'll be here.
1103000	1104000	I'll be here all night.
1104000	1105000	I...
1105000	1106000	I always...
1106000	1107000	I felt bad.
1107000	1108000	But when you were doing stand-up,
1108000	1109000	are you still doing stand-up?
1109000	1110000	Do you still actually...
1110000	1111000	No, no, no.
1111000	1112000	I...
1112000	1113000	I did it a long time ago.
1113000	1115000	And first of all, the confidence,
1115000	1118000	when I saw the people lining up to see your show
1118000	1120000	and I walked by them,
1120000	1122000	and they had no idea who I was,
1122000	1125000	and I'm the whole show.
1125000	1126000	And he's whispering.
1126000	1129000	I look familiar, is what I got.
1129000	1130000	Sometimes I get a...
1130000	1132000	Maybe he set up.
1132000	1136000	But if I'm lucky, people, they come up to me to go,
1136000	1138000	where do I know you from?
1138000	1140000	And I list my credits.
1140000	1142000	And if it's a single mom,
1142000	1144000	then I do the kid's animation.
1144000	1146000	Right, straight.
1146000	1148000	Try to hit on them like a pedophile.
1148000	1149000	You know, like,
1149000	1151000	Hi, I'm Rusty from Handy Manny.
1151000	1153000	Is your daddy not around?
1153000	1154000	Hey.
1155000	1158000	I'm a monkey wrench that talks.
1158000	1162000	Just ignoring the kid and trying to talk to the mother.
1162000	1164000	Are you a bachelor right now?
1164000	1165000	And tell me...
1165000	1167000	By the way, I don't know...
1167000	1168000	If I'm ever prying or anything,
1168000	1170000	you don't have to talk about stuff.
1170000	1171000	I don't know why I...
1171000	1172000	Yeah, I'm like Greg Proops.
1172000	1174000	I only riff about pop culture.
1174000	1175000	Yeah.
1175000	1176000	Nothing personal.
1176000	1177000	No.
1177000	1178000	I just...
1180000	1181000	Does anyone know me?
1181000	1182000	No, I...
1184000	1185000	I need something.
1185000	1187000	I think that when people see your face...
1187000	1189000	I think this is the lucky kind of fame, I would say.
1189000	1191000	I would wager there's plenty of people
1191000	1193000	that wouldn't maybe see your face and go,
1193000	1195000	Oh, that's who that guy is.
1195000	1196000	But then when they say,
1196000	1197000	Where do I know you from?
1197000	1199000	It doesn't matter what credit you choose.
1199000	1201000	Because as soon as you start talking,
1201000	1203000	they go, Oh, Fred Stoll.
1203000	1204000	Not after that.
1204000	1206000	Usually they recognize me.
1206000	1208000	And they go, I don't mean to bother you.
1208000	1210000	And I'm so glad someone broke up the isolation
1210000	1212000	that now I'm bothering them.
1212000	1213000	Right, right.
1214000	1215000	Hey, where are you going?
1215000	1218000	I've been to the Grove before and I'm following them.
1218000	1221000	And I'm so lonely.
1221000	1223000	The frustrating thing is,
1223000	1224000	I did one sign,
1224000	1226000	filled just a few Raymans and people think I'm rich.
1226000	1227000	Right.
1227000	1229000	Like they point to the Hollywood Hills.
1229000	1230000	He must live up there.
1233000	1236000	Specifically show them the exact little apartment.
1238000	1240000	There's a new thing called Celebrity Net Worth.
1240000	1242000	Have you looked up yourself on this?
1242000	1243000	No, no.
1243000	1245000	It has, you know, with him and it's, you know, probably,
1245000	1247000	you know, 18 million, you know, all that stuff.
1247000	1249000	And I'm on it.
1249000	1250000	And it's very wrong.
1250000	1252000	It's 1.5 million.
1252000	1257000	And, you know, so I've had dates that one woman goes,
1257000	1259000	This can't be right.
1259000	1261000	Yeah, you have to have more than that.
1262000	1265000	So people now look up my credits.
1265000	1266000	They see a lot of stuff.
1266000	1268000	That would be nerve wracking.
1268000	1272000	And so, yeah, I have somebody, because somebody was in a Twitter
1272000	1275000	spat with me and there must,
1275000	1277000	my income or something must have come up,
1277000	1280000	like whether I'm fancy or richer, because it must have been.
1280000	1283000	And then somebody posted as if like spiking a football,
1283000	1284000	this link.
1284000	1286000	I was like, what is this going to be a link to?
1286000	1288000	Is this how you get like doxed or whatever you got?
1288000	1290000	It was like, and I clicked on it.
1290000	1292000	And it was this thing like, yeah,
1292000	1295000	like what are they worth dot org or something like that?
1295000	1298000	I said, Dan Harmon worth net worth five million dollars.
1298000	1299000	I was like, wow.
1299000	1300000	Yeah.
1300000	1301000	Yeah.
1301000	1302000	Money you don't know about.
1302000	1303000	And then I went through it.
1303000	1306000	I said, I guess maybe if I like sold everything,
1306000	1308000	I guess worth is like, yeah, it's not liquid.
1308000	1310000	It doesn't say how liquid are they like.
1310000	1313000	Remember if I sold everything.
1313000	1314000	And borrowed money.
1314000	1315000	No.
1315000	1317000	Like what Rick and Morty will be worth and syndication.
1317000	1318000	They're putting all that.
1318000	1319000	Oh, well, yeah.
1319000	1320000	Well, geez.
1320000	1321000	I mean, if you're allowed to start counting that,
1321000	1322000	then I'm in Ron, right?
1322000	1323000	Like I get to just go.
1324000	1327000	Because if you get to start counting that, then it's like, well,
1327000	1329000	because I'll never see that money.
1329000	1332000	However, I do have a stake in it.
1332000	1335000	So it's like, like sometime when I'm 70 years old,
1335000	1336000	in theory,
1336000	1342000	a check for like hot topic Rick slippers will come in or something.
1342000	1347000	And I'll be like, like, like it'll be at the right medical technology
1347000	1349000	or they'll be able to just feed those checks into the machine
1349000	1351000	that keeps my heart beating.
1351000	1354000	10 more beats.
1354000	1356000	And I'll be like, Mr. Harbin, you're doing great.
1356000	1358000	You're 70 years old.
1358000	1362000	Most of your average person lives to 35 today.
1362000	1364000	Can you hear the gunshots outside?
1364000	1367000	Can you smell the sulfur?
1367000	1368000	More money.
1368000	1369000	More Rick and money.
1369000	1373000	More money.
1373000	1376000	He calls it Rick and money now.
1376000	1378000	I love how savvy people are now.
1378000	1380000	I mean, you are savvy because, you know, you know,
1380000	1382000	show business from following him.
1382000	1383000	But it was at this thing.
1383000	1385000	Hey, you get good results.
1385000	1387000	You get checks, you know, to hear what Larry David.
1387000	1390000	Hey, they'll see a Seinfeld that was on and go, hey,
1390000	1391000	checks are coming to you.
1391000	1392000	How much?
1392000	1393000	Yeah.
1393000	1394000	That's my impression of a moron.
1394000	1396000	It's brilliant.
1396000	1399000	But answering your question, I used to just stand up
1399000	1402000	and I fell into it during the 80s comedy boom,
1402000	1405000	but you know when you were alive or?
1405000	1407000	That's how a lot of their parents conceived them.
1407000	1411000	But both of their parents had an open mic during the 80s
1411000	1414000	stand up boom and here they are.
1414000	1418000	And I was very shy and depressed, believe it or not.
1418000	1421000	And now people have different ways to make it.
1421000	1422000	You go on YouTube.
1422000	1424000	You see this and that.
1424000	1427000	But I only knew like stand up someone.
1427000	1428000	I thought to make it as an actor,
1428000	1431000	your parents have to put you in the Brady Bunch.
1431000	1432000	Only children.
1432000	1435000	And I was another reason to hate my parents for not putting
1435000	1438000	Fred in a TV show like you fuck.
1438000	1441000	And like they knew they were supposed to do that.
1441000	1442000	So then I went to.
1442000	1444000	I guess it makes sense if you're a kid and you're thinking about
1444000	1447000	the people on TV, you're like, how else would they?
1447000	1448000	Yeah, you don't know.
1448000	1450000	Like I said, now there's every, you know, E.
1450000	1451000	Harmon.
1451000	1452000	Not E.
1452000	1453000	Harmon.
1453000	1454000	Whatever the hell.
1454000	1456000	You know, these links like this is how you make it.
1456000	1460000	Like I probably wouldn't have been a stand up if I tried now.
1460000	1461000	I don't know what I would have done,
1461000	1463000	but you're just savvy with it.
1463000	1464000	You'd have been on an improv team.
1464000	1465000	Yeah.
1465000	1467000	So good as you could see.
1467000	1468000	Yeah.
1468000	1471000	That's because the internet hasn't changed anything about the
1471000	1473000	industry in the important ways.
1473000	1475000	Like the idea that, I mean,
1475000	1477000	that's a ridiculous generalization.
1477000	1479000	The internet has changed some things about the entertainment industry,
1479000	1482000	but the, the, the, the,
1482000	1487000	the biggest change is basically the size of the waiting room for auditions.
1487000	1489000	Like that, that, that, that's,
1489000	1491000	that's how I put it like, especially for actors,
1491000	1492000	like nothing's changed for actors.
1492000	1494000	Like, oh, how do I get my start as an actor?
1494000	1496000	Well, you know, you want to say like, oh,
1496000	1499000	just get on YouTube and put on a fresh face and just like,
1499000	1501000	but they've been doing that for 15 years.
1501000	1503000	And all it does is that's,
1503000	1504000	they might as well be doing that.
1504000	1506000	I mean, they can make a million dollars doing that and never get into
1506000	1507000	Hollywood.
1507000	1512000	But then Google will say, sorry, fart smart's been shut down now.
1512000	1513000	No more fart smart.
1513000	1515000	I grew up on it.
1515000	1517000	Well, yeah, it's like people think Fred,
1517000	1519000	isn't there so many more opportunities now?
1519000	1521000	Well, no, there's just more bullshit.
1521000	1525000	You know, now when I was, you know, came to Hollywood,
1525000	1526000	there weren't as many things,
1526000	1529000	but they were like real things like a part on Murphy Brown.
1529000	1530000	Right.
1530000	1531000	You know what I mean?
1531000	1532000	Or like a amen or something.
1532000	1536000	It was like a big deal when I moved to LA in like the mid nineties,
1536000	1537000	late nineties.
1537000	1541000	It was like a person would get a spot on a sitcom.
1541000	1542000	Yeah.
1542000	1545000	Like they'd be like the pizza guy that hits on a Dharma.
1545000	1546000	Yes.
1546000	1550000	And, but it turns out to be Greg's a clone.
1550000	1551000	No.
1551000	1552000	Why would clone?
1552000	1553000	I can't even pitch a fucking idea.
1553000	1554000	I can't get through one idea.
1554000	1556000	I fucked it up at the end.
1556000	1557000	If he says clone, use the same actor.
1557000	1558000	You dipshit.
1558000	1559000	You already own that guy.
1559000	1561000	I've done so many delivery guys.
1561000	1562000	Yeah.
1562000	1563000	So I've lost it.
1563000	1564000	I've lost it.
1564000	1565000	There's so many more quote unquote opportunities,
1565000	1566000	but it's so saturated.
1566000	1567000	But we would have parties.
1567000	1569000	We would have everybody.
1569000	1571000	Everybody would show up at that person's apartment.
1571000	1575000	You have chips and nachos and chips and nachos.
1575000	1576000	I'm going to kill myself.
1576000	1579000	I'm going to fucking kill myself on this stage.
1579000	1580000	Next week.
1580000	1582000	And I'm not saying that for clicks.
1582000	1583000	Are you?
1583000	1586000	Maybe you'll kill and murder yourself.
1586000	1590000	Cheese puffs and little doodles because, hey, so and so guy,
1590000	1591000	I got it.
1591000	1592000	They're going to be what?
1592000	1593000	One time it was on wings.
1593000	1595000	Like, come on through the wing.
1595000	1597000	The guy would come through on, you know, be your friend.
1597000	1599000	And he'd go, someone ordered pizza.
1599000	1601000	And he'd go like, aha.
1601000	1603000	And then the, and then the commercial would start and you
1603000	1606000	turn up the music and you just be like, you know,
1606000	1609000	when I would do guest spots, my friends would say,
1609000	1610000	where were you on it?
1610000	1612000	Meaning you're getting the middle.
1612000	1614000	So how much of that shit do I have to say?
1614000	1617000	It's like a chore to them, you know,
1617000	1618000	because they're flicking back.
1618000	1619000	What's that?
1619000	1620000	Don't ask him.
1620000	1621000	What's that?
1621000	1624000	I know.
1624000	1627000	There's a there's a there's a gimmick with the people
1627000	1629000	yelling stuff out that I've encouraged somehow.
1629000	1630000	And that's all right.
1630000	1634000	I'm not going to be a pussy.
1634000	1636000	You don't have to be gentle for me.
1636000	1639000	Usually, usually I if somebody starts yelling something out
1639000	1641000	because they're so concerned about something,
1641000	1644000	I find that about 75% of the time it becomes fruitful.
1644000	1645000	I'm like, like, what is this person?
1645000	1647000	You've lost your mind.
1647000	1649000	We're talking about ninjas or dolphins or something.
1649000	1651000	And then they'll keep talking and go,
1651000	1653000	do you want to just come up here so that you'd stop ruining
1653000	1655000	the show and talking to the microphone and then they come up
1655000	1657000	and then several of them become parts of the show.
1657000	1660000	And so it's a fun, nice part of the show.
1660000	1661000	It's like a town meeting.
1661000	1663000	But then I have guests on and then someone goes like,
1663000	1664000	hold the butter.
1664000	1665000	And then I can see.
1665000	1667000	I can see your nervous system go.
1667000	1670000	That means I'm failing because it does.
1670000	1672000	If you're in a stand up club like Kumail, you know,
1672000	1673000	Kumail Nanjiani.
1673000	1674000	Yeah, of course.
1674000	1676000	Like I said, he's like the he's like the brightest,
1676000	1677000	smartest, sharpest dude.
1677000	1679000	But I know he has like a stand up like DNA.
1679000	1681000	So like when people talk in the audience,
1681000	1683000	I could see his like, I could see his like,
1683000	1688000	like Iron Giant, like, like, like, like, like, like,
1688000	1689000	it's just like, oh, no, what?
1689000	1690000	No, what?
1690000	1692000	What were you saying?
1692000	1696000	Oh, so you're saying you're a fucking idiot.
1696000	1697000	Okay.
1697000	1699000	And then he just continues.
1699000	1702000	And I'm like, whoo, okay.
1702000	1704000	Well, when you're trained in stand up,
1704000	1705000	what I did, you know, like I said,
1705000	1707000	the comedy boom in the eighties,
1707000	1709000	then when I started getting some guest spots,
1709000	1713000	we think we're bombing because I come in a Murphy Brown.
1713000	1715000	Hey, I'm the delivery guy.
1715000	1716000	I suck.
1716000	1717000	You know what I mean?
1717000	1719000	Because it's dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
1719000	1721000	And then you go into the writer's room,
1721000	1723000	haven't you worked in writer's rooms and stuff?
1723000	1724000	Not too many.
1724000	1727000	The only thing, I was on Seinfeld as a writer
1727000	1729000	and there was no writer's room.
1729000	1730000	Did you know how Seinfeld worked?
1730000	1731000	Not really.
1731000	1735000	There's, I was brought in in the 94, 95 season,
1735000	1737000	again, before you were born.
1737000	1740000	And what happened was I knew Larry David
1740000	1742000	from the New York stand up days
1742000	1745000	and he would kind of taunt me, which,
1745000	1747000	you sound like an Indian now.
1747000	1750000	You're like a pathetic loser.
1750000	1752000	You're like a piece of shit.
1752000	1754000	You make everyone feel uncomfortable
1754000	1756000	because you're like a handicap guy walking around
1756000	1758000	and they want to look at you.
1758000	1760000	Your head's down.
1760000	1763000	When's the last time someone like you got laid?
1763000	1767000	And that's really what he said to me.
1767000	1770000	I was at my friend's surprise birthday party.
1770000	1772000	This became a curved episode.
1772000	1773000	He came late.
1773000	1776000	I want to scream surprise like a fucking idiot, you know.
1776000	1778000	Hey, I'm in here now.
1778000	1779000	Hey, that's Rodney.
1779000	1783000	He's just Rob Schwab but nine active blowers, that's it.
1783000	1788000	Yeah, so he was, everyone in 94 was writing a spec script,
1788000	1790000	you know, for Seinfeld.
1790000	1793000	And he goes, how come you ever wrote a spec script?
1793000	1796000	And I'm an idiot.
1796000	1798000	Like, because again, people are savvy.
1798000	1800000	I thought when you wrote on a sitcom,
1800000	1802000	you make the salary.
1802000	1806000	I didn't know that sitcom writing became five jobs ahead.
1807000	1810000	Like, the idea is not to, hey, I'm going to write on Seinfeld
1810000	1814000	and make whatever the 2000 a week would be.
1814000	1815000	Sorry.
1815000	1816000	If you're at home right now.
1816000	1818000	Okay, why was that funny?
1818000	1819000	2000 a week.
1819000	1821000	All right, I'm getting him a little bit.
1821000	1823000	Dan has picked up a kettle bottle
1823000	1825000	and the ice is completely touched if you're listening.
1825000	1827000	I'm thinking, all right.
1827000	1829000	I was like, yeah, don't steal a focus.
1829000	1830000	Fred's telling a story.
1830000	1832000	Fred doesn't want to like...
1832000	1833000	And then I lifted it.
1833000	1835000	It's like a fucking Marx Brothers bit.
1836000	1837000	It's everything you want.
1837000	1839000	Dan, what I mean is now people know about...
1839000	1840000	It's nothing more prime.
1840000	1843000	All right, I want the ice to get broken off.
1843000	1847000	And what I mean is now people who...
1847000	1850000	I forgot why I was putting the liquid out of the bottle.
1850000	1854000	I don't mean to bash Harvard because, you know, it's cliche
1854000	1857000	and I'm sure you went there and the community writers.
1857000	1859000	But they know...
1859000	1860000	I went to dirt.
1860000	1862000	All right.
1862000	1863000	Don't you know that's my issue?
1863000	1865000	You don't, because we're both narcissists.
1865000	1866000	So you don't know.
1866000	1867000	I have class issues.
1867000	1869000	That's why I couldn't function in writers' rooms
1869000	1871000	because everybody was from Stanford and Harvard and Yale.
1871000	1872000	And I'd be like...
1872000	1874000	Every time we got in a fight about coffee,
1874000	1875000	I'd be like, you know, I'd be like,
1875000	1877000	nothing or Ivy League bullshit!
1877000	1881000	Well, when I was temporarily on Seinfeld,
1881000	1882000	which I'm plugging,
1882000	1884000	I had a Kindle single called my Seinfeld year.
1884000	1886000	Did anyone hear this?
1886000	1888000	Well, it made him laugh in one person.
1888000	1889000	All right.
1889000	1891000	And you.
1891000	1894000	We will be handing out copies at the end of the show.
1894000	1896000	The actual thing is I'm happy to see you,
1896000	1899000	but I'm only disappointed because thinking I was going to plug,
1899000	1904000	I have a new one and I sent Jeff Davis the PDF of it
1904000	1907000	to save $1.99, what it costs, thinking he'll be going,
1907000	1908000	hey, it's great.
1908000	1910000	Wait, I want to make sure I understand this.
1910000	1912000	You sent Jeff Davis a PDF...
1912000	1913000	Of my new book.
1913000	1914000	Of your new book.
1914000	1915000	Okay.
1915000	1916000	Thinking, you know, go, hey,
1916000	1918000	I don't want him to spend $1.99.
1918000	1920000	These things called Kindle singles.
1920000	1921000	They're legit.
1921000	1923000	I know $1.99 people make fun of them.
1923000	1926000	And, yeah, dude sent it to me.
1926000	1928000	And so, could you pretend it's really good?
1928000	1930000	Five minutes to kill and you're Jeff?
1930000	1932000	That book, it changed my life.
1932000	1936000	I've read a lot of authors, and this book, your book, the book.
1936000	1937000	All right.
1937000	1939000	Well, I'm positive that if in any way...
1939000	1944000	I've talked to Lee Daniels about making your book
1944000	1947000	into at least a four-part movie series.
1947000	1948000	What about Leonard Smalls?
1948000	1950000	And Biggie Smalls.
1950000	1951000	Biggie Smalls as well.
1951000	1954000	But when I was on Seinfeld, one of the Harvard guys goes,
1954000	1957000	you know, because I would pitch things for my life,
1957000	1960000	which was just fucked up, you know?
1960000	1962000	He goes, you know, nothing bad ever happened to me.
1962000	1964000	I have to make things up.
1964000	1966000	And I wanted to punch him, like, now something bad happened.
1966000	1968000	Yeah.
1968000	1971000	These guys were never unemployed a millisecond in their life,
1971000	1974000	but they learned how to do the Larry formula
1974000	1976000	of just doing things.
1976000	1979000	So basically, there's no room.
1979000	1981000	You know what a writer's room is, right?
1981000	1983000	Okay. Okay.
1983000	1985000	They can put it together, pitch, actually.
1985000	1987000	All right.
1987000	1991000	So basically, you have to come up with a Jerry Kramer, Elaine,
1991000	1993000	and who's the fourth one?
1993000	1994000	George.
1994000	1995000	George.
1995000	1996000	George.
1996000	1998000	I, by accident, did 50 milligrams of Inedible the other night.
1998000	1999000	I'm an idiot.
1999000	2000000	The other night.
2000000	2002000	Yes, and it's still in me.
2002000	2004000	And so you have to pitch.
2004000	2005000	There's no room.
2005000	2007000	Like, no one's trying to come up with stories together.
2007000	2010000	My analogy, it's like a homicide division.
2010000	2013000	We're all trying to solve murders, but our own murders.
2013000	2016000	And fuck you, I'm doing the O'Daniel's murder.
2016000	2017000	You should shut our door.
2017000	2018000	We don't help you.
2018000	2021000	So I'm walking around, and there's a guy,
2021000	2023000	I have a restraining order from.
2023000	2024000	I'm not making this up.
2024000	2025000	From?
2025000	2027000	From my book, my Seinfeld year.
2027000	2029000	Check it out.
2029000	2032000	I talked about some people, and I got sued,
2032000	2034000	and I have a restraining order against someone.
2034000	2036000	I didn't mention his name a writer,
2036000	2039000	and I called him a pseudonym, and he would,
2039000	2041000	he'd lately, when my book came out,
2041000	2043000	he would pound on my door, going, fuck you,
2043000	2045000	you ruined my life, you know?
2045000	2048000	Because I haven't worked in 10 years
2048000	2050000	because of your book that's been out three years.
2050000	2052000	And, uh...
2052000	2055000	You should read my book looking for someone to blame.
2055000	2057000	Yes, yes.
2057000	2059000	So he would, like, bang on my door,
2059000	2061000	leave notes, and he had this fixation
2061000	2064000	we would go on Dr. Drew, and he'd leave notes,
2064000	2066000	we're gonna tell the world what a piece of shit
2066000	2067000	you are on Dr. Drew.
2067000	2069000	That was his manifesto, like...
2069000	2071000	Wait, I'm sorry, back up, because I don't understand that.
2071000	2073000	You said he had...
2073000	2074000	You were on...
2074000	2075000	No, no, no.
2075000	2076000	How did Dr. Drew get involved?
2076000	2079000	He thinks that I know Dr. Drew so well...
2079000	2080000	Oh.
2080000	2082000	...that we were gonna go on his podcast,
2082000	2086000	and I would confess what a piece of shit liar I am.
2086000	2088000	That is some bullshit.
2088000	2090000	He was like, oh, I got this deal.
2090000	2093000	You should get us on some Dr. Drew so I can get some money.
2093000	2094000	Yes.
2094000	2095000	And then get this episode.
2095000	2096000	We'll get residuals.
2096000	2098000	So this guy pretended to be my mentor.
2098000	2099000	Oh.
2099000	2100000	So I was on my own, and he goes,
2100000	2102000	bro, it's like, nah, I'm here.
2102000	2104000	But I'll show you the ways, and I was...
2104000	2107000	I made myself look like an asshole for listening to this guy.
2107000	2109000	So I was the one who put myself down in the book
2109000	2111000	that I'm such a schmuck.
2111000	2113000	I don't believe that you would put yourself down in your book.
2113000	2114000	All right.
2114000	2116000	I feel like it must be another one of these,
2116000	2117000	and I'm such a big shot.
2117000	2118000	Yes.
2118000	2120000	I don't get the narcissist, but in a different way.
2120000	2121000	I get it.
2121000	2122000	Oh, no.
2122000	2123000	You know what I mean.
2123000	2124000	Yeah, you know what I mean.
2124000	2125000	You and I hate ourselves, but we've...
2125000	2126000	That's what I always felt about Howard Stern.
2126000	2128000	In one way, he goes, yeah, I'm cool.
2128000	2129000	Then he puts himself down.
2129000	2131000	Didn't you see that dichotomy in Howard Stern?
2131000	2132000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2132000	2135000	I mean, to me, I relate to that.
2135000	2137000	You're a purebred something.
2137000	2138000	Like, I don't know.
2138000	2140000	Like, you're amazing, and that's why you're...
2140000	2142000	I mean, I'm jealous of you because you...
2142000	2143000	No, I'm jealous.
2143000	2144000	You're voice...
2144000	2147000	So much of this guy's walking out.
2148000	2149000	He's getting a...
2149000	2150000	He's just taking a poop.
2150000	2151000	No, no, no.
2151000	2152000	He's...
2152000	2156000	But, no, when you would get up on stage at the...
2156000	2159000	When I was living in Milwaukee, I hadn't moved to L.A. yet,
2159000	2162000	and you were one of the, like, five, six...
2162000	2164000	There used to be a thing, like,
2164000	2166000	there were so many comedy segments,
2166000	2169000	so many of these cable, evening at the improv,
2169000	2172000	Pulper, Venza, Mario, Joyner,
2172000	2174000	that you could make a marginal living
2174000	2176000	doing the same set every...
2176000	2177000	You know, on all these...
2177000	2179000	The A-list, we called it A-list
2179000	2181000	because everyone was on it.
2181000	2182000	But those shows...
2182000	2183000	But you would come out.
2183000	2185000	I mean, we were coming out of an age
2185000	2187000	where, like, someone would come up with a hammer on their head
2187000	2188000	and say, hey, I'm a hammerhead,
2188000	2189000	and people would laugh,
2189000	2191000	and then that person would be kind of fucked for 10 years.
2191000	2194000	But you weren't one of those,
2194000	2196000	but the funny thing is that you were so on point,
2196000	2198000	you were so true to your own voice,
2198000	2201000	that I bet a lot of people think you're doing a character,
2201000	2203000	because you would come up on stage,
2203000	2205000	and the audience would stop clapping,
2205000	2207000	and then you would say something like,
2207000	2208000	yeah, I'm kind of a...
2208000	2209000	I guess you're probably thinking,
2209000	2213000	I'm like, oh, hey, look at the cool guy.
2213000	2214000	Or like...
2214000	2216000	That's why I split stand-up,
2216000	2217000	because it's stuff like that.
2217000	2218000	That's my actions.
2218000	2219000	Yeah, exactly.
2219000	2220000	That's why I never...
2220000	2221000	But, you know, you'd go like,
2221000	2223000	I'm a bit of a thrill seeker or whatever.
2223000	2224000	You had your bits about it.
2224000	2225000	I live on the edge.
2225000	2227000	I drank milk that expired yesterday.
2227000	2229000	There's all these jokes.
2229000	2231000	But when you would say I'm a thrill seeker,
2231000	2233000	the audience would unanimously laugh.
2233000	2234000	And that's the thing.
2234000	2236000	That seems to be part of your voice,
2236000	2239000	is that you're like, why is that funny?
2239000	2241000	Well, because they looked at you,
2241000	2243000	and you said something that they were thinking...
2243000	2245000	Remember Louis Anderson's bit, when he would say...
2245000	2246000	Yes, brilliant.
2246000	2247000	He would open with fat jokes,
2247000	2249000	and then after he did like three minutes of fat jokes,
2249000	2250000	he'd take a pause,
2250000	2251000	and then he'd say,
2251000	2253000	I always have to open with the fat jokes,
2253000	2254000	because if I didn't,
2254000	2255000	someone in the audience would be sitting there saying,
2255000	2256000	do you think he knows?
2256000	2264000	And that is like a thing of like...
2264000	2265000	It's about essence.
2265000	2268000	It's like Sam Christensen is this class that I took,
2268000	2269000	right here in Burbank.
2269000	2270000	You told me,
2270000	2272000	and you said you'd guarantee I'd get laid
2272000	2274000	if I took it and you were going to pay.
2274000	2275000	Did you take it?
2275000	2277000	No, because you didn't pay,
2277000	2278000	like you said you would.
2278000	2280000	You guaranteed I'd get laid.
2280000	2281000	You remember saying that?
2281000	2282000	I'll pay for it.
2282000	2284000	Maybe he was going to pay for the lay.
2284000	2285000	Yes.
2286000	2288000	He's looking up Sam Christensen.
2288000	2291000	And yes, you know,
2291000	2292000	the thing is,
2292000	2294000	like a lot of comedians were insecure,
2294000	2297000	but I never learned overcompensation,
2297000	2299000	like these scrappy guys,
2299000	2301000	hey, I'm Greg Fitzsimmons or whoever,
2301000	2302000	I'm scrappy.
2302000	2304000	Yeah, shots fired.
2304000	2307000	Mad comic beats right now.
2307000	2309000	I feel embarrassed, yeah,
2309000	2312000	like saying, hey, I'm great and all that stuff.
2312000	2313000	So like I said,
2313000	2316000	I got into stand-up because it seemed to way,
2316000	2318000	my idol was like Jimmy Walker.
2318000	2319000	I never saw a guy like him,
2319000	2321000	skinny, black, funny-looking.
2321000	2322000	I go, hey, that's like me.
2322000	2323000	Don't keep looking at me, man.
2323000	2324000	I know.
2324000	2327000	If I don't, if I don't, it's racist.
2327000	2328000	You know, when you're on purpose.
2328000	2330000	It's not Dino Mike.
2330000	2331000	All right.
2332000	2334000	He looked away on funny-looking.
2334000	2335000	He was saying it.
2335000	2336000	I know, but I had to get it because he was,
2336000	2337000	you know, he's trying.
2337000	2338000	I'm trying to gape.
2338000	2342000	It's like, I can't pitch shows.
2342000	2343000	A few times you do,
2343000	2345000	you ever try to engage like the third person in the show?
2345000	2347000	You're not just talking about a really important person.
2347000	2350000	So in this show, and then high third person,
2350000	2352000	we're not ignoring,
2352000	2354000	there'll be three different arc breaks
2354000	2356000	and you're the really important person.
2356000	2358000	And out of that, you know what I'm talking about?
2358000	2360000	There's that fourth one.
2360000	2362000	I did that.
2362000	2364000	I went to a show where it was,
2364000	2366000	it was right when the stand-up thing
2366000	2367000	gave way to storytelling.
2367000	2370000	So now I was allowed on stage with you guys
2370000	2374000	and like Beth Lapita's show or something like that in LA.
2374000	2377000	And one thing I did was like,
2377000	2379000	because I'm such a master storyteller,
2379000	2380000	that just stuck out my head.
2380000	2382000	I'm like, what the fuck did that sound like?
2382000	2384000	Now I'm in.
2384000	2386000	I was waiting for my opening in this world.
2386000	2389000	It was because of a TV credit, let's be frank,
2389000	2392000	but then you're allowed to go up to these cabaret shows
2392000	2393000	and you have a drink and you say,
2393000	2395000	my dad hit me and they're like, that's great.
2395000	2397000	Here's a drink.
2397000	2401000	But I did one of those and it was like me,
2401000	2404000	Mark Maron and maybe like, let's say Scott Thompson,
2404000	2405000	I think was there.
2405000	2407000	And it was, and there was like,
2407000	2409000	we almost outnumbered the audience.
2409000	2412000	And it was like right on that bubble where it's like,
2412000	2414000	they must have talked about canceling the show.
2414000	2417000	There's like six people sitting there and then three,
2417000	2419000	and then the other two performers.
2419000	2420000	And I remember distinctly,
2420000	2423000	like it was such a weird thing that Mark Maron,
2423000	2424000	while he was on stage,
2424000	2429000	he coped with the weird sensation of performing
2430000	2432000	to only that many people.
2432000	2434000	I had only met him for the first time that night,
2434000	2436000	but he just kept on.
2436000	2438000	Maybe my laugh was louder or something,
2438000	2440000	but he basically kind of did his whole act to me,
2440000	2442000	but it really filled me with confidence.
2442000	2445000	I think I killed with the six people afterwards,
2445000	2448000	but I probably went on before him.
2448000	2450000	And so he was just like, you know what I mean?
2450000	2451000	You know what I mean?
2451000	2452000	You need the feedback.
2452000	2455000	You were talking about comedians, how they, you know,
2455000	2458000	like, you know, a man of the cool.
2458000	2462000	I'm blaming old age when I forget names, the guy, you know,
2462000	2464000	Silicon Valley, Dinesh.
2464000	2465000	Camille.
2465000	2466000	Oh, yeah.
2466000	2467000	Camille Manjani.
2467000	2468000	Yes.
2468000	2469000	Well, I did some guest spots.
2469000	2473000	Bob Saget had a show called Raising Dad, which sounds funny.
2473000	2475000	And it was the two kids grew up,
2475000	2478000	Harrison Briel and Kat Jennings.
2478000	2481000	So Saget and Kenler, they were just working,
2481000	2484000	Paramount had these tours going through,
2484000	2487000	and they'd be doing a rehearsal and, hey, hey, and, you know,
2487000	2490000	in acting class you'd have comedians, and you're doing a scene,
2490000	2493000	but they'd work the other people for laughs.
2493000	2495000	So comedians have that mindset.
2495000	2498000	But what you just said about storytelling,
2498000	2500000	I'm bringing it back to the Seinfeld writing.
2500000	2502000	So this guy would always say,
2502000	2504000	I'll tell you when to pitch laugh,
2504000	2506000	because you have to approach his door and knock
2506000	2509000	and come in and pitch a Jerry Cramer Lane and George story,
2509000	2511000	and you can't do anything until they're approved.
2511000	2514000	And I'd be approaching, he goes, not a good time, bro.
2514000	2515000	Not a good time.
2515000	2516000	And I was so insecure.
2516000	2518000	I tried everything out on him.
2518000	2519000	He goes, no, no.
2519000	2522000	And he kind of ended up sabotaging me.
2522000	2526000	And so sometimes, one thing I learned from writing,
2526000	2529000	and so there was no room, you're totally on your own.
2529000	2531000	The one lesson I learned for writers,
2531000	2533000	and I'm sure you could attest to this,
2533000	2537000	is when you try things out on friends, people, smart people,
2537000	2540000	only try it out on a guy that could say yes or no.
2540000	2541000	You know what I'm saying?
2541000	2543000	Because I tried out things on this day also.
2543000	2545000	He said, no, no, no, I'm concerned.
2545000	2546000	That's not good.
2546000	2549000	Then someone else ended up doing it, not because they stole it,
2549000	2552000	but because they tried it out on Larry David,
2552000	2554000	and I asked these middlemen.
2554000	2557000	Well, yeah, I want to interject,
2557000	2560000	and not because there's anything to defend or correct,
2560000	2563000	but because I find this fascinating,
2563000	2565000	that every show is different.
2565000	2568000	And I'm surprised to hear that,
2568000	2572000	but a lot of shows do have just the rooms where the people sit.
2572000	2573000	There's no room.
2573000	2574000	Pow wow.
2574000	2575000	And then there's one.
2575000	2577000	Community worked like that,
2577000	2579000	because that's how I understood it to work,
2579000	2581000	or rather maybe that's what Neil and Garrett,
2581000	2584000	who worked on Scrubs and were helping me run my first show.
2584000	2586000	That's really most, like, 97% work.
2586000	2589000	It's like you come into work, and you sit,
2589000	2592000	and then you've got a bunch of, it's like a police station,
2592000	2594000	where it's like you got your...
2594000	2596000	Yeah, you work on this, and they work...
2596000	2598000	This is what's been going on since yesterday,
2598000	2600000	so how is it going in that room and that room,
2600000	2602000	and then people kind of go off back to there.
2602000	2605000	So there's always, like, one person who's working on a draft or an outline.
2605000	2607000	There's, like, a couple people working, hopefully,
2607000	2609000	if you're really healthy, that they're a joke room,
2609000	2611000	and they're punching stuff up,
2611000	2613000	and then there's a story-breaking room.
2613000	2617000	No, I had no idea what other episodes were in the pipeline,
2617000	2619000	what was going on, you totally...
2619000	2621000	So you couldn't do anything.
2621000	2624000	One time I made a mistake, I tried out this idea.
2624000	2628000	Kramer does a one-man show called One Time My Uncle Hit Me,
2628000	2631000	you know, like those confessional things.
2631000	2633000	I said, that's good, that's good.
2633000	2635000	So I'm writing it up, and then I bring Larry in my room.
2635000	2637000	What the fuck is that?
2637000	2640000	You don't fucking put things on the board until I see it.
2640000	2642000	But Blackpacy said it was good.
2642000	2644000	What the fuck, you idiot?
2644000	2646000	You can't, uh...
2646000	2648000	Is it possible, Larry David,
2648000	2651000	that there's something missing from your translation of him,
2651000	2654000	that, like, maybe he's smiling while he's saying so?
2654000	2655000	Well...
2655000	2657000	He seems to be a joyful guy.
2657000	2659000	I know he's grumpy, but he was...
2659000	2660000	What time this happened?
2660000	2664000	You make him sound like a bad guy from Revenge of the Nerds,
2664000	2667000	like, like, like, like, he just a lot of didn't, like, hurt you.
2667000	2669000	What time this happened to me?
2669000	2671000	The editing room was next to my room,
2671000	2674000	so you can't do anything until the stories are connected.
2674000	2675000	So I would like...
2675000	2678000	One time I stood outside the room trying to pitch.
2678000	2681000	I waited an hour, and these two aggressive guys from Harvard
2681000	2683000	went right in, and then they pitched.
2683000	2686000	They went right in front of me, and I was so exhausted from waiting.
2686000	2688000	I went in my room and snapped for an hour.
2688000	2691000	So I'd go play pinball and, you know, walk around,
2691000	2693000	and one time he passes.
2693000	2695000	So he wasn't the worst guy,
2695000	2698000	because he said something nice for a moment.
2698000	2701000	He goes, I see you're not part of the clique.
2701000	2703000	I see that.
2703000	2705000	That was the nicest thing.
2705000	2707000	He goes, Jesus, that's the nicest thing.
2707000	2709000	Yeah, well, wait till the story goes.
2709000	2712000	And then he goes, you know, when I was on Saturday Night Live,
2712000	2713000	my, uh...
2713000	2714000	All right, I don't have to...
2714000	2716000	It's like doing a Norm Macdonald way open for it.
2716000	2717000	Don't get me started.
2717000	2720000	You can't do a story with that going, eh, eh, buddy, eh, eh.
2720000	2722000	You got the three sneakers.
2722000	2724000	You fucker, eh, eh.
2724000	2725000	So, all right, so I'll try to do...
2725000	2727000	I think you should... No, keep doing your Larry David.
2727000	2728000	All right, so he goes, uh...
2728000	2730000	When I was a writer at Saturday Night Live,
2730000	2732000	my, uh, office was right by the elevator,
2732000	2734000	and all the writers would walk by for lunch
2734000	2736000	and not include me.
2736000	2737000	So I know that you're not...
2737000	2739000	I see you're not part of the clique.
2739000	2741000	He goes, so you got to get aggressive.
2741000	2744000	You find me on the floor, you look,
2744000	2746000	and you throw things at me.
2746000	2748000	Just throw things at me.
2748000	2750000	And, yeah, they went, all right.
2750000	2754000	So they go, hey, Larry, I had this idea.
2754000	2756000	There was a guy that sees a Mr. Pitt.
2756000	2758000	I don't know if you remember who he was.
2758000	2760000	Um, and I said, what if he gets into it
2760000	2762000	with Jerry Stiller's character?
2762000	2765000	He goes, that's a fucking stupid idea.
2765000	2768000	He goes, all right, I did tell you to try things out on me,
2768000	2771000	but that was fucking stupid, Freddy.
2771000	2775000	I did tell you, but not that shit.
2775000	2777000	So, uh...
2777000	2779000	Why did he hire you?
2779000	2781000	He kept...
2781000	2783000	There's something missing from this story, I do think,
2783000	2786000	because it seems to me like, you know Shrab and you know
2786000	2787000	our friend Abed, right?
2787000	2788000	Yes.
2788000	2789000	So you think I'm like Abed.
2789000	2791000	Have you seen, well, I mean...
2791000	2796000	No, the dynamic, I mean, you've seen Shrab abuse Abed.
2796000	2800000	Well, my theory is that he sees in me
2800000	2802000	what he doesn't like about himself,
2802000	2804000	because when he was on Saturday Night Live,
2804000	2808000	he didn't like any of the equivalent of Harvard writers,
2808000	2810000	but then when it's his thing, so he...
2810000	2813000	I started to stand up with him and Gilbert Gottfried.
2813000	2818000	He goes, me, you and Gilbert were the three biggest fucking losers.
2818000	2822000	He goes, Freddy, your only chance of getting a woman is if you're blind,
2822000	2824000	because you're doomed, you're a Jew from Brooklyn,
2824000	2826000	and we went to the same high school.
2826000	2828000	I don't know, he saw something.
2828000	2832000	So basically, how I got the job was Steve Scrobin,
2832000	2836000	I don't know if you know who he is, and it doesn't help in this story.
2836000	2839000	He was the one who had the surprise birthday party.
2839000	2845000	So in 94, 95, before they got this influx of the Ivy League guys,
2845000	2849000	he would hire stand-ups from his New York days,
2849000	2853000	and so it was almost like the beginning of Platoon,
2853000	2858000	where they go, you're going to like the nom, you know?
2858000	2861000	Because I had friends of mine that were just...
2861000	2863000	They did the same thing, but they had camaraderie.
2863000	2866000	Four New York stand-ups came in, and they were totally on their own,
2866000	2869000	and you weren't sure if you were supposed to start up a story.
2869000	2872000	So he kind of got a kick out of, you know...
2872000	2875000	He goes, you know, a lot of shitty things happen to you.
2875000	2878000	Maybe you could use the shitty things from your life, you know,
2878000	2880000	because I felt episodes.
2880000	2883000	So he goes, how come you never wrote a spec script?
2883000	2887000	He goes, write one, nothing will happen, but I will read it.
2887000	2890000	And I wasn't gonna, because that wasn't the route, I wasn't smart,
2890000	2892000	like I said, people now, they know.
2892000	2894000	What I mean, they're five jobs ahead,
2894000	2896000	because I thought, you know, you make a salary.
2896000	2900000	Now all the guys at lunch, executives from Castle Rock
2900000	2903000	on their next three deals, you know what I'm saying?
2903000	2904000	I wasn't savvy.
2904000	2907000	I wasn't even savvy, I could get laid as a writer.
2907000	2910000	I was, oh man, go back in time.
2910000	2912000	That makes me feel, I feel bad.
2912000	2914000	I don't want to feel bad for you,
2914000	2916000	because I don't want pity to sprinkle on you,
2916000	2918000	and throw a pity receptor.
2918000	2920000	No, no, I'll tell you, it's all a happy ending.
2920000	2921000	Okay, all right.
2921000	2923000	Because no, that was in my route.
2923000	2927000	I never, I know comics, they watched the raw Petri,
2927000	2930000	Dick Van Dyke, and they wanted to be around a table.
2930000	2932000	I just wanted to be a character actor, you know what I mean?
2932000	2936000	I didn't know about houses, and you write on sitcoms.
2936000	2938000	And it never appealed to me, like, you know,
2938000	2940000	you see the run-throughs, they're like cows.
2940000	2942000	Moving on to Jerry's apartment,
2942000	2944000	and you see them on the Ratford lot, they look like cows,
2944000	2945000	you know what I mean?
2945000	2948000	They just, you know, the writers, you know, walking.
2948000	2950000	I was always jealous of those people, too, yeah.
2950000	2952000	I mean, I don't want to interrupt your story, but...
2952000	2954000	No, so basically what happened was,
2954000	2956000	I wasn't going to write a spec script,
2956000	2959000	but in 1994, there would be people dying
2959000	2962000	to have Larry David read their Seinfeld spec script,
2962000	2965000	you know, so I said, let me just write one,
2965000	2967000	just in case, like, the next Dan Harmon goes,
2967000	2969000	hey, Fred, do you have a spec script,
2969000	2970000	I'd have one ready.
2970000	2972000	Because he kept saying nothing will happen.
2972000	2974000	Or that Dan Harmon, probably not the next one.
2974000	2975000	Right, right, yes.
2975000	2977000	Just to have it ready.
2977000	2979000	And again, I'm an old man going,
2979000	2980000	back then they didn't have the Internet,
2980000	2983000	and I had to really look for a Seinfeld script
2983000	2984000	to see how it's done,
2984000	2986000	and my friend helped me with the format,
2986000	2988000	and in my spec script,
2988000	2992000	I used a story based on, many years ago,
2992000	2994000	oh, God, when you're old, you keep...
2994000	2997000	My new book I wrote, everything is back before the Internet.
2997000	2999000	You know, you have to practice it.
2999000	3001000	Back before cell phones.
3001000	3004000	And before there was the Internet,
3004000	3006000	remember, there was,
3006000	3008000	now there's no such thing as a blind date.
3008000	3010000	Unless your name is, like, Phyllis Smith,
3010000	3013000	because, oh, this is what she looks like, what she makes.
3013000	3015000	You know, you get pictures, Facebook.
3015000	3018000	So someone wanted to set me up with a woman,
3018000	3019000	but she was away from wherever,
3019000	3021000	the Hamptons till the summer,
3021000	3022000	and I was so excited,
3022000	3025000	I wanted to have the visualization to be excited.
3025000	3028000	I thought of a funny bit where,
3028000	3030000	what if I hire a police composite artist
3030000	3032000	to sketch what she looks like,
3032000	3035000	to go, all right, yeah, looking forward to that.
3035000	3039000	So that was part of the spec script.
3039000	3043000	And then I once, this they end up using at Seinfeld.
3043000	3047000	I met a woman in London, and it was unbridled sex.
3047000	3049000	This was 1990 when I...
3049000	3050000	Oh, 96.
3050000	3054000	And I remember, I remember, no, 1990.
3054000	3056000	Yeah, yeah, the beginning.
3056000	3058000	I remember, I confessed to her,
3058000	3060000	I haven't had sex in six months.
3060000	3061000	She goes, so long.
3061000	3063000	I remember when that was so long.
3063000	3064000	Wow, I wish it was that recent.
3065000	3067000	You know why we had so much sex in 1990?
3067000	3069000	We had no idea how to dress.
3069000	3070000	Right.
3070000	3072000	Because it was like, it was like 1989, New Year's Eve.
3072000	3075000	We were like, what are we going to do about all this Velcro?
3076000	3079000	We can't just start dressing like hippies, too.
3079000	3081000	We will by 93, but...
3081000	3085000	So I put in a storyline where I flew her to LA,
3085000	3088000	and it was almost like she gave her ticket
3088000	3089000	to a woman that looked like her.
3089000	3091000	She goes, you flew me here just for sex,
3091000	3093000	and if I said what instead of pardon,
3093000	3096000	she'd scrunch, so he said, I like the spec script.
3096000	3098000	Yeah, yeah, let me show it to Jerry.
3098000	3103000	And so he liked this stuff, and I was brought on.
3103000	3106000	And just as a quirky guy, and then I'm...
3106000	3108000	Brought on as a, to be on screen.
3108000	3110000	No, no, no, as a staff writer.
3110000	3111000	Oh, okay.
3111000	3112000	From that spec script.
3112000	3113000	So that's the...
3113000	3114000	Yeah, I...
3114000	3118000	So rewinding from that, before that spec triumph,
3118000	3120000	what were you doing?
3120000	3122000	You were at the office, you were being abused by co-workers.
3123000	3125000	But you weren't getting paid?
3125000	3127000	Wait a minute, I'm confused.
3127000	3130000	You may have been a slave, and it's illegal.
3130000	3132000	Wait, wait, wait, where was I not getting paid?
3132000	3133000	No, I was on...
3133000	3134000	I thought you were...
3134000	3135000	For 40 weeks.
3135000	3136000	Well, when you said you're five jobs behind,
3136000	3137000	or you're five...
3137000	3140000	No, no, no, what I meant is that they're strategizing.
3140000	3143000	Writers now, I'm speculating.
3143000	3147000	You don't go, gee, I just got a writing job on Community.
3147000	3149000	You go, ooh, it's a cachet,
3149000	3151000	then I'll be able to pitch FX shows.
3151000	3152000	I see what you mean.
3152000	3153000	That's what I mean.
3153000	3155000	Okay, you meant being on staff on a sitcom,
3155000	3157000	that's hardly the end of any rainbow.
3157000	3158000	Right.
3158000	3160000	But they don't think, gee,
3160000	3162000	the book is called Program Consulted,
3162000	3163000	I'm making 2,200 a week.
3163000	3164000	Ooh, that's cool.
3164000	3167000	No, they think Seinfeld, they'd be on lunch
3167000	3169000	getting their next deals, and they're five jobs ahead,
3169000	3170000	is what I meant.
3170000	3172000	And the unspoken implication there, I think,
3172000	3174000	or maybe I'll put words in your mouth,
3174000	3175000	or maybe why don't I just say my own,
3175000	3178000	is the reason that's really true is because
3178000	3179000	you could get that far,
3179000	3181000	you could have a staff writer job on a sitcom,
3181000	3183000	but then both because of what happened
3183000	3184000	to the industry and technology,
3184000	3187000	and because of the fact that you're right,
3187000	3190000	you're competing with aggressors,
3190000	3192000	you're competing with professional,
3192000	3194000	you know, I don't want to undercut
3194000	3196000	everyone that can hurt me in the business,
3196000	3199000	and everyone I wouldn't want to hurt because I like them,
3199000	3201000	because they became my friends, some of them.
3201000	3204000	But there's a DNA there,
3204000	3206000	I always look at it like dog breeds,
3206000	3209000	because there's dogs that are good,
3209000	3212000	he's a great joke writer,
3212000	3215000	but part of being a good joke writer
3215000	3218000	is that he drives that person and that person so nuts,
3218000	3221000	he has to fax his jokes in from home.
3221000	3225000	And then that person's not that good a joke writer,
3225000	3228000	but they're so vibrant in the room
3228000	3232000	that their jokes seem funnier, like 20%,
3232000	3235000	and then these other people who are different breeds,
3235000	3238000	they end up pushing that joke,
3238000	3241000	because there's the breed of...
3241000	3243000	It's a chemistry assembly.
3243000	3245000	Yeah, and I would never want to say it,
3245000	3247000	because there's no such thing as a breed of dog
3247000	3249000	that's a good dog or a bad dog,
3249000	3251000	unless, you know, pugs are evil,
3251000	3253000	but no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
3253000	3255000	I'm kidding, I know that pug owners
3255000	3257000	are driven by their protectiveness.
3257000	3259000	That's why I made that joke.
3259000	3261000	You can't talk shit about pugs,
3261000	3263000	that's the point of that breed,
3263000	3268000	it exists, but for a surplus of protectiveness
3268000	3271000	in the human breeders that bred it,
3271000	3273000	it can't breathe unless you q-tip its face
3273000	3275000	every three weeks.
3275000	3277000	It is a dog that is falling apart,
3277000	3280000	it is a pile of dog, it looks like you spilled a dog.
3280000	3282000	Their eyes pop out?
3282000	3284000	I mean, it's...
3284000	3285000	They do, yeah.
3285000	3287000	And what could they ever do?
3287000	3288000	A dachshund?
3288000	3291000	I'll tell you what, they used to use them to clean cannons.
3292000	3297000	I know every breed, they all had a use.
3297000	3302000	Anyways, arrow quivers, they would clean them with dachshunds,
3302000	3307000	but pugs are just there so that we can feel angry
3307000	3309000	about people making fun of our dogs.
3309000	3312000	That dog's cute for the first two years of its life,
3312000	3315000	and they do not age well.
3315000	3319000	Old pugs are ugly as fuck and old pug owners know it.
3319000	3324000	Pugs were part of an ill-advised program
3324000	3327000	to breed rescue dogs.
3327000	3329000	For murder.
3329000	3331000	That's how we get a big laugh.
3331000	3334000	I was like, this is impressive, I can't do stand-up,
3334000	3336000	but I would have wrote that down on a yellow pad
3336000	3337000	and gone, this'll kill.
3337000	3338000	I just wrote that over here.
3338000	3341000	Pugs are part of an ill-advised program
3341000	3343000	to breed rescue dogs.
3343000	3345000	Laugh, but no.
3345000	3347000	Because you're breeding them all fucked up,
3348000	3351000	so you don't have to go to the humane center
3351000	3354000	because it's like, oh, that dog has three legs and one eye,
3354000	3355000	I'm going to rescue it.
3355000	3356000	No, it's a pug.
3356000	3359000	It could be a thoroughbred pug, and it needs your help.
3359000	3360000	It needs your help.
3360000	3364000	No, you made a face like, no, stop.
3364000	3366000	Well, it also elicits that feeling
3366000	3369000	because if you look at a pug, you go like, that's me,
3369000	3372000	I'm an underdog, that's me in grade school,
3372000	3375000	that's me in high school.
3375000	3378000	It's the little girl dressed as a bee in the Blind Melon video.
3378000	3380000	That's what a pug is.
3382000	3384000	Because sometimes, Dachshunds, you want to be tempted,
3384000	3387000	but you're not, no, that's the kid that was into sports casting,
3387000	3390000	and so all the basketball players thought he was cool.
3390000	3393000	Could I kill the momentum of this bit that's killing?
3393000	3397000	No, a writer, no, I just did.
3397000	3401000	A writer's question, which I don't know if they care about this stuff,
3401000	3404000	do you think it's easier to fake being a writer on a sitcom
3404000	3407000	than a show like Breaking Bad or Justified?
3407000	3411000	A guy could just be aggressive and loud and throw out jokes.
3411000	3414000	He could fake million-dollar career in sitcoms,
3414000	3418000	but can someone fake that in the world of those dramas?
3418000	3420000	Well, I want to make sure I understand the question
3420000	3423000	because I do want to answer it, but I don't understand the question.
3423000	3426000	Well, it sounds like you were saying, or maybe I'm saying that,
3426000	3430000	you could fake your way to a nice career in a sitcom at a table,
3430000	3435000	fake it just by making jokes and not really being as good a writer,
3435000	3438000	but there's more of a skill set is what I'm thinking.
3438000	3441000	Those one hours, you can't fake it, you can't be loud or go,
3441000	3444000	ha-ha-ha, then Bryan Cranston dies.
3444000	3446000	Ha-ha-ha.
3446000	3448000	Hey, they'll have a stripper by him.
3448000	3449000	Oh, yeah.
3449000	3453000	I don't want to piss off my friends that work on drama shows,
3453000	3456000	but they're a less fraternal bunch,
3456000	3458000	so they probably aren't as easily pissed off,
3458000	3462000	and the few I've talked to about this will confess that,
3462000	3465000	because when a comedy writer sits with a drama writer,
3465000	3468000	it's only a matter of a couple drinks before the comedy writer says,
3468000	3471000	admit it, it's easier, and they go, yes.
3471000	3472000	Ha-ha-ha.
3472000	3473000	Which is easier than drama.
3473000	3475000	Yes, of course it's easier, there's no jokes.
3475000	3476000	I'm like, you knew it, I knew it.
3476000	3477000	Ha-ha.
3477000	3479000	But you cannot tell anyone I ever said that.
3479000	3482000	See, I'm in awe of that, like, justified,
3482000	3485000	because I think, Rayland, uh, like, whatever.
3485000	3489000	But I just want to make sure, because I didn't mean to imply,
3489000	3491000	I didn't want to be too cynical and say,
3491000	3494000	just because there's all these different breeds of writers.
3494000	3495000	It's a symmetry.
3495000	3498000	First of all, the idea that writers could work as a pack,
3498000	3500000	which is, again, how my metaphor is awesome,
3500000	3502000	is an achievement of the species,
3502000	3507000	because writers aren't supposed to be subject to the Henry Ford principle.
3507000	3509000	That should have been the death of entertainment.
3509000	3511000	We should have been in the era that we're in now,
3511000	3514000	uh, in terms of, like, our definitions of comedy and stuff,
3514000	3516000	way back when the first studios were like,
3516000	3518000	yeah, but can't you make it faster?
3518000	3520000	I don't know, what if there was more of ya's?
3520000	3521000	Ha-ha-ha.
3521000	3525000	And writers were stuck in a room together,
3525000	3529000	and just imagine that cave painting of writers being forced to do that,
3529000	3531000	and they're the worst.
3531000	3534000	They're egotistical, they're defensive, they're thin-skinned,
3534000	3536000	they're thin, thick-skinned in the wrong ways.
3536000	3539000	They're, you know, they're the monsters.
3539000	3542000	And then they go, fuck it, then.
3542000	3545000	We'll have rules for that, and we'll...
3545000	3547000	To me, that's analogous with the human species.
3547000	3550000	So it's almost like the Seinfeld writers' room is more natural.
3550000	3551000	I don't...
3551000	3552000	But also...
3552000	3554000	It sounds like it was, uh, weird.
3554000	3556000	You already said that you heard that.
3556000	3558000	But I think that's probably a successful show, too,
3558000	3559000	when the stakes get high.
3559000	3560000	They know what they're doing.
3560000	3561000	You can't dispute.
3561000	3563000	And then it's like you're coming in, so you're coming...
3563000	3565000	Yeah, it's like the army knows what it's doing, too.
3565000	3567000	So if you come in as a new writer, it's not like,
3567000	3569000	Hey, my name's Samantha, here's your bunk.
3569000	3573000	It's like, fuck you, die, or figure it out.
3573000	3575000	That's what a good pack does.
3575000	3578000	But I wanted to bring it around to the fact that...
3578000	3580000	Because there's so much...
3580000	3583000	My connection to you is the self-abuse.
3583000	3585000	I mean, you can't stop.
3585000	3586000	You just...
3586000	3590000	You have a potato in one hand and a potato peeler in the other,
3590000	3592000	and before you ever come around to peeling the potato,
3592000	3594000	you'll be like, fucking...
3594000	3596000	You will be fully peeled yourself.
3596000	3599000	When people tell Fred you've been on every sitcom in the 90s,
3599000	3603000	not news radio, not Frasier, I gotta correct them.
3603000	3606000	And all of that, but it's like, that's the thing.
3606000	3609000	I don't even know if it's possible for you to become a douchebag because of that,
3609000	3611000	because you're gonna be one of those...
3611000	3613000	You said in the beginning...
3613000	3614000	Overcompensates.
3614000	3615000	You didn't overcompensate.
3615000	3616000	We know that breed.
3616000	3618000	That's a dangerous breed.
3618000	3621000	That's 85% of people who...
3621000	3622000	The world.
3623000	3625000	Comedically, guys who were nerds.
3625000	3627000	And then they go, well, but I was funny.
3627000	3630000	And then they got that stick that says they were funny,
3630000	3634000	and then they start using it in a way that they wouldn't have if they didn't have that stick.
3634000	3638000	So it's a weird thing, but it's like, well, if you're fucking a victim
3638000	3643000	and someone gives you the power because they like watching you be a victim,
3643000	3647000	it's hard, and you've always had that voice.
3647000	3650000	You've always been that guy for real.
3650000	3651000	Well, it was the error.
3651000	3654000	And people have always been drawn to it, and some people are even drawn to abuse you.
3654000	3657000	Because, yes, Norm Macdonald, when I opened for him...
3657000	3659000	Let's not go there. No, I'm just kidding.
3659000	3663000	No, they're booing me for saying something they don't know.
3663000	3665000	That didn't happen, Fred.
3665000	3666000	No.
3666000	3668000	No, like a guy like Don Marrara...
3668000	3670000	Even they want to fucking abuse you right now.
3670000	3673000	Like a guy like Don Marrara, no one's gonna bully him,
3673000	3675000	because I think I... Yeah, I see.
3675000	3679000	There's a guy... I'll tell you later, but I don't want to turn on this crowd.
3679000	3681000	Why don't you do that, Fred?
3681000	3683000	If they're sweating, why not have them... No.
3683000	3686000	See, I grew up... There was no such thing as nerds.
3686000	3688000	They were nebishes, sad sacks.
3688000	3690000	Nerds are like cool.
3690000	3693000	And it's like, you know, now...
3693000	3695000	There's a lot of comedians now.
3695000	3698000	There's Shlubby, and, you know, there's like this guy,
3698000	3701000	a good guy, Matt Marrara, you know who he is?
3701000	3702000	Yeah.
3702000	3703000	Heavy guy. He's a great guy.
3703000	3705000	But if he was there in the 80s, hey, I'm a Shlub.
3705000	3707000	And it's like, hey, yeah, you're not a loser.
3707000	3709000	Hey, you know, so it's just pop culture.
3709000	3711000	You know, I'm like being a nerd.
3711000	3713000	You're referencing Matt Marrara.
3713000	3716000	But, you know, so I'm like...
3716000	3719000	But it's like, when I did stand up,
3719000	3722000	there was no thought that I wanted to do it to be cool.
3722000	3725000	First thing, it's embarrassing being cool.
3725000	3729000	So now it's sort of like the old nerds that were picked on,
3729000	3732000	someone said, the nerds now are like the bullies.
3732000	3733000	Yeah.
3733000	3736000	I remember back in the 90s when this was starting,
3736000	3738000	Bobcat Galtway, I'm stealing his line,
3738000	3740000	all these, like, Largo people.
3740000	3743000	He goes, they're all so cool, like, cancel each other out.
3743000	3749000	And so it's, yeah, so nerd became cool, and I resent that.
3749000	3752000	Well, yeah, and you should.
3752000	3754000	And then there's, like, Andy Kindler,
3754000	3757000	who is awesome at moving with that resentment.
3757000	3759000	And maybe that's not your essence.
3759000	3760000	No.
3760000	3761000	Like, maybe...
3761000	3763000	But Kindler, I have a problem with.
3763000	3765000	Shots fired.
3766000	3767000	I have a problem with him.
3767000	3769000	I already went on Marc Maron, did five minutes,
3769000	3770000	and why he bothers me.
3770000	3771000	No, he's a great guy.
3771000	3772000	He's hysterical.
3772000	3775000	But he went to these alternative rooms,
3775000	3779000	and it's like, yay, yay, I'm nervous.
3779000	3780000	It's like an old Jewish guy.
3780000	3782000	Why is this alternative?
3782000	3785000	You know, it's like, there's a guy, Bruce Smirnoff,
3785000	3788000	who's like a Jewish guy.
3788000	3790000	It's very guns and knives-y.
3791000	3797000	So Kindler, why Mrs. Harold has this alternative guy,
3797000	3801000	this rebel who is the biggest schmoozer.
3801000	3802000	Oh, God.
3802000	3803000	No, he's a great guy.
3803000	3805000	No, I already teased him about this.
3805000	3807000	You know what I'm saying?
3807000	3808000	You know what it is?
3808000	3809000	My mother once said,
3809000	3811000	I don't like pushy, nervy people,
3811000	3812000	because I resent them.
3812000	3815000	I wish I could be pushy and nervy.
3815000	3817000	So I resent Kindler because he could schmooze.
3817000	3818000	He's good at it.
3818000	3822000	I resent everybody because I wish I had their abilities sometimes.
3822000	3824000	I mean, how many times have you been cut off in traffic,
3824000	3828000	and there's some small part of you that's like,
3828000	3830000	God damn it, that person's winning at life.
3830000	3833000	I've never cut anyone off in traffic,
3833000	3836000	which means that I have spent so much more of my life
3836000	3838000	in fucking anxiety and thinking about other people
3838000	3840000	than I needed to,
3840000	3844000	because that person clearly never thinks about fucking anything
3844000	3847000	and had that time for Pokémon or something.
3847000	3848000	Yes.
3848000	3849000	And I don't...
3849000	3850000	It's never...
3850000	3856000	I just want to...
3856000	3860000	I want to make sure you understand,
3860000	3862000	and I think you do.
3862000	3863000	I do.
3863000	3864000	Don't feel bad for me.
3864000	3867000	I'm happy because I could never survive in a writer's room.
3867000	3870000	But let's forget about feeling bad.
3870000	3874000	Forget about pity and feeling bad and all that stuff.
3874000	3879000	I want you to know how prudent it is,
3879000	3886000	how strategically justified it is for you to stay who you are,
3886000	3889000	because it ends up paying more.
3889000	3891000	Big money.
3891000	3894000	It ends up paying more whether you have to...
3894000	3897000	Well, it's just about what you can live with.
3897000	3899000	No, it took me...
3899000	3902000	When I was younger, it was more like comparing myself,
3902000	3903000	I can't say this,
3903000	3905000	but it's really so liberating when you get older,
3905000	3908000	when you're out of the games of women,
3908000	3911000	trying to be women and trying to get pilot season,
3911000	3912000	when it's sort of over.
3912000	3913000	Now I can do what I like to do.
3913000	3916000	I'm too old a guy to be pitching my own show,
3916000	3918000	and it's so liberating because you just...
3918000	3920000	Well, first of all, that doesn't make any sense to me at all.
3920000	3921000	As I told you when I saw you upstairs,
3921000	3922000	I was dreading seeing you
3922000	3923000	because I haven't seen you in three years,
3923000	3926000	and everyone that I haven't seen in three years
3926000	3929000	is going to make me feel like I'm 90 years older
3929000	3931000	because we're all melting at a parabolic rate.
3931000	3934000	So I was telling my girlfriend about you,
3934000	3936000	and like, oh, I'm going to see Fred, and he's amazing,
3936000	3939000	and she knew who you were by reputation and stuff like that.
3939000	3942000	Reputation? What the fuck does that mean?
3944000	3946000	I have a reputation with a girl you talk to?
3946000	3949000	What the fuck are you holding out on me for?
3950000	3952000	But no, I was talking to her about you,
3952000	3955000	and I was like, you know, he's Fred Stoller,
3955000	3956000	and I was doing my impression of you
3956000	3957000	because you're fun to do an impression of.
3957000	3960000	I'm sure that makes you very happy.
3960000	3964000	Especially when Tom Kenny gets extra money in voiceovers.
3964000	3966000	And then I stopped in the middle.
3967000	3969000	And I got really scared because I was like,
3969000	3974000	ah, Fred's, like, Fred, you could draw on a cave wall
3974000	3976000	even if you hadn't gone to art school.
3976000	3980000	Like, inside and out, Fred is so specific
3980000	3982000	and so archetypal and so pure,
3982000	3984000	and now I'm going to see him,
3984000	3986000	and there's going to be something
3986000	3988000	that's going to spoil that for me.
3988000	3989000	It looked like Christopher Lloyd.
3989000	3991000	Yeah, you're going to be like,
3991000	3993000	something that was equally beautiful,
3993000	3995000	but if I had known you for 20 years
3995000	3996000	as the other thing, I'd be like,
3996000	4000000	oh, fucking time can suck my dog balls, whatever.
4000000	4001000	But you...
4001000	4003000	No, it's still...
4003000	4005000	Like, I sound like Billy Crystal doing that
4005000	4007000	for an Analama's character or whatever,
4007000	4009000	but the idea that you look good
4009000	4011000	and that's supposed to make you feel good.
4011000	4014000	I'm saying, why would you not be pitching your...
4014000	4015000	No, I've tried.
4015000	4017000	Little shows and Netflix and things.
4017000	4019000	But I'm just a weird, older guy.
4019000	4020000	You know, I'm not just...
4020000	4021000	That's the point.
4021000	4022000	It's point of view now.
4022000	4023000	You don't...
4023000	4026000	The game is not just making 350 million people go,
4026000	4027000	oh, I get it.
4027000	4028000	What is that?
4028000	4029000	I had an idea for a web series.
4029000	4030000	They liked the idea.
4030000	4031000	Let's do it.
4031000	4032000	A web series to go,
4032000	4034000	can you get some YouTube stars?
4034000	4035000	Like, who do you know?
4035000	4036000	Any time I've tried,
4036000	4038000	like, who do you know that's more famous than you
4038000	4040000	that will sell this?
4040000	4041000	Who are your friends?
4041000	4042000	Can you bother Fred Willard again?
4042000	4044000	No, no more bothering Fred Willard.
4044000	4045000	I always bother him.
4046000	4048000	He used to call me on the phone,
4048000	4050000	and there were still landlines,
4050000	4052000	and I was trying to write Monster House,
4052000	4054000	and for some reason I was doing a lot of cocaine,
4054000	4055000	and I...
4055000	4057000	I think it was because I had just found out
4057000	4058000	how easy it was to buy in LA,
4058000	4059000	and it was so hard in Milwaukee,
4059000	4061000	and I was like, I don't even like Coke,
4061000	4063000	but now it's so cheap, like...
4063000	4065000	And so I just had, like, the CD case.
4065000	4067000	There was these things called CDs.
4067000	4069000	You turned them and listened to them
4069000	4071000	with a laser needle,
4071000	4074000	and it was covered with, like, Coke residue,
4074000	4075000	and then I'd be trying to figure out
4075000	4077000	why a house would be a monster,
4077000	4078000	and then the phone would ring,
4078000	4081000	and you'd be calling me,
4081000	4083000	because we had just made friends,
4083000	4085000	and you were like...
4085000	4088000	The idea that I was the paragon of confidence for you
4088000	4090000	was...says a lot.
4090000	4092000	Like, as you were calling me for advice,
4092000	4094000	I'm like, what is this motherfucker?
4094000	4097000	Like, you're like, listen, have you ever tried...
4097000	4100000	Like, what do you do when you park in a grocery store?
4100000	4102000	Like, do you look for the park...
4102000	4104000	Because I've been driving...
4104000	4106000	I went to the store today,
4106000	4108000	and I just drove away.
4108000	4110000	I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.
4110000	4112000	Like, you couldn't handle the pressure
4112000	4115000	of parking at a grocery store,
4115000	4117000	and you called me...
4117000	4120000	No, you intimidated me,
4120000	4122000	because the last few times I bumped into you
4122000	4124000	were really, like, angry Dan.
4124000	4126000	I mean, intimidating.
4126000	4127000	Oh, so...
4127000	4128000	Wait, wait, no.
4128000	4129000	Larry David...
4129000	4130000	No, I don't...
4130000	4131000	No, no, you were nice to me,
4131000	4134000	like, there were these stupid nature half-moon walks
4134000	4136000	and the full moon...
4136000	4139000	And you went, I'm just here to fucking get laid.
4139000	4140000	And, like...
4140000	4142000	Oh, I was in a bad place.
4142000	4143000	Yes.
4143000	4144000	That sounds like it.
4144000	4146000	Yeah, I'm fucking this bitch.
4146000	4147000	I didn't say bitch.
4147000	4150000	You didn't do that, but that helped a little bit.
4150000	4152000	That helped to laugh a little bit.
4152000	4153000	Did I say...
4153000	4154000	No, but you got...
4154000	4156000	You were so brave, and there was a very attractive...
4156000	4158000	I would have said, I'm here to have sex with this girl.
4158000	4160000	You were the very attractive girl.
4160000	4161000	Very...
4161000	4162000	I won't say in front of her.
4162000	4164000	I bumped into her since, and I was so jealous.
4164000	4168000	She was sweet, and you said, I'm just here to fucking get laid.
4168000	4171000	I don't think you said fuck, but you said to get laid.
4171000	4172000	Fuck all this.
4172000	4173000	You know this nature bullshit.
4173000	4175000	But no, no, you're great, but...
4175000	4177000	I was in a phase at that time...
4177000	4180000	But you were acting like the asshole, and you were getting laid.
4180000	4183000	There was a girl that told me, and this is not negging.
4183000	4185000	Like, this isn't that red pill shit.
4185000	4188000	Like, I had come into my own as...
4188000	4191000	I had come out of a relationship where I was like...
4191000	4193000	I can't remember what this was in between, where I was like...
4193000	4197000	The justification in my head was, for about a year, I just was...
4197000	4200000	I was a pig, but not like...
4200000	4202000	I don't think I was abusive.
4202000	4203000	No.
4203000	4204000	I was a pig.
4204000	4207000	One woman said to me, which I will always remember,
4207000	4210000	because I thought it actually summed up exactly what I was doing,
4210000	4213000	and she was a customer that was explaining,
4213000	4218000	oh, this is why I stopped and bought this fucking soup that made me sick.
4218000	4220000	And I was like, oh, that's what's on the label.
4220000	4227000	She said, like, I spent so much energy trying to catch guys and their red flags,
4227000	4231000	and you wave yours like a matador.
4231000	4233000	And that's what it was, and it wasn't...
4233000	4234000	You're intimidating.
4234000	4235000	I want the kids to know.
4235000	4236000	I want these millennials to know.
4236000	4238000	First of all, I said that was a year, and I was...
4238000	4241000	Fuck, I looked back, and I almost killed myself, and I was miserable.
4241000	4242000	I almost burnt my apartment down.
4242000	4243000	It was a bad time.
4243000	4245000	I'm also not saying don't ever do that.
4245000	4246000	Do it.
4246000	4247000	Go for it.
4247000	4251000	But that is not the same as this, because these are weird fucking times,
4251000	4255000	and that shit is kissing cousins with some ideologies that have to do with
4255000	4260000	hurting other people in order to, like, reverse psychology.
4260000	4261000	This is...
4261000	4264000	The baseline is total id.
4264000	4265000	And that's...
4265000	4268000	If you meet somebody at a party that just says,
4268000	4272000	I'm very lonely, would you like to make out later?
4272000	4273000	Like, that's...
4273000	4274000	He's not...
4274000	4279000	Like, that guy can have a reasonable time.
4279000	4284000	Like, because then you're playing money ball with statistics.
4284000	4285000	And that...
4285000	4289000	I resent the fact that that bleeds into this other camp
4289000	4294000	that's about, like, taking it back from women who never took it away.
4294000	4295000	Like, that's the thing...
4295000	4297000	That's why I want to, like, put a big fucking fat asterisk on that,
4297000	4300000	but I was going through that phase where I was, like...
4300000	4301000	I would just be...
4301000	4302000	I would just...
4302000	4303000	And I'd probably...
4303000	4306000	It dates a lot, because I felt like I had done that wrong for the first part of my life.
4306000	4308000	So every girl I talked to that I was attracted to,
4308000	4309000	I would just...
4309000	4311000	I was, like, trying to be in the zone where I'd be, like,
4311000	4313000	I'm very attracted to you.
4313000	4316000	I would try not to, you know, like, snowplow them,
4316000	4318000	but, like, like...
4318000	4322000	I got a lot of, like, fucking humiliating, like, eye rolls and, like, walk away.
4322000	4323000	Like, like, really?
4323000	4324000	You'd say that to me?
4324000	4325000	But I'd be, like...
4325000	4326000	I always...
4326000	4328000	I'm very attracted to you, and I'd like to make out with you.
4328000	4330000	Now that you don't need those lines anymore,
4330000	4332000	can we hear one of them, or...?
4332000	4333000	I'm kidding.
4333000	4336000	No, you're intimidating me at the Super Bowl parties?
4336000	4337000	Super...
4337000	4339000	The Joe Hodgson thing?
4339000	4340000	I guess it's just everybody in there.
4340000	4341000	I was in my late 20s.
4341000	4343000	That's some people for 15 years of their life.
4343000	4346000	Some people die at 65 years old staying that way.
4346000	4349000	You hear the humanity in him talking about Trump and all this stuff.
4349000	4352000	I mean, that's why I wasn't as intimidated, you know?
4352000	4353000	Right.
4353000	4357000	I feel I need to do a Star Trek joke to get you back.
4357000	4358000	Because I don't...
4358000	4359000	I can't believe you...
4359000	4360000	I'm late to this angst.
4360000	4362000	You told these people everything about Dan.
4362000	4364000	Now I see why Larry David fucked with you.
4364000	4365000	Yeah.
4365000	4367000	Well, I want to tell you something.
4367000	4371000	People think I'm an easy mark, but I got sued by this guy,
4371000	4373000	and I didn't get bullied.
4373000	4375000	I didn't get bullied with the guy with the restraining order.
4375000	4377000	I pushed him away, and...
4377000	4379000	What happened with the end of that?
4379000	4381000	And he...
4381000	4385000	To give him credit, he didn't know it was illegal what he was doing.
4385000	4387000	Okay.
4387000	4389000	To threaten you and intimidate him?
4389000	4391000	To bang on my door, leave notes, and say,
4391000	4393000	let's go on Dr. Drew.
4393000	4394000	So when you say...
4394000	4396000	So when you say, restraining order...
4396000	4397000	We went to court.
4397000	4398000	Did you file it, or did he file it?
4398000	4400000	This is the funny thing.
4400000	4402000	That's it.
4402000	4405000	I filed the restraining order.
4405000	4408000	Some friends served him.
4408000	4413000	And then a few days later, he serves me with one,
4413000	4416000	saying, I can't go near him because I'm threatening him.
4416000	4417000	So I go, wait.
4417000	4420000	So I could get arrested if I'm in my own hallway
4420000	4423000	where he lurks, if he gets this restraining order.
4423000	4425000	You're describing Cape Fear, I think.
4425000	4426000	Yes, yes.
4426000	4428000	It's like competing radiuses.
4428000	4429000	I don't know.
4429000	4431000	Did anyone ever file for a restraining order?
4431000	4433000	That room you go to downtown?
4433000	4435000	I feel like there's probably two people,
4435000	4436000	at least in the room, that have.
4436000	4438000	It was weird, because it's all different types, right?
4438000	4440000	It's probably not a fun situation.
4440000	4444000	Menorities, all different people, rich, poor, and then...
4444000	4446000	Wait, we had one hand up.
4446000	4448000	Did you file one that plays downtown?
4448000	4451000	Would you be willing to talk about your restraining order?
4451000	4455000	Okay, would you like to come up, please?
4455000	4459000	See, that's...
4459000	4462000	Happy Memorial Day.
4462000	4463000	And you had to go to a place downtown
4463000	4465000	where you wait with all the people?
4465000	4467000	I was a minor at the time.
4467000	4469000	Oh, what happened?
4469000	4470000	Check.
4470000	4471000	I was told by...
4471000	4475000	If you're listening to the live, free Wednesday podcast
4475000	4478000	and my mic was bad for the first half of the show,
4478000	4483000	we've replaced it.
4483000	4485000	Have you seen Breaking Bad?
4485000	4486000	I've seen Breaking Bad.
4486000	4489000	So my dad was like a Jewish Walter White?
4489000	4490000	Sorry, what's your name, sir?
4490000	4491000	Ori.
4491000	4492000	Ori?
4493000	4496000	Keep the mic like kissy distance.
4496000	4498000	Wait, your father was a Jewish anything?
4498000	4499000	Yeah.
4499000	4500000	No, no, no, you got to turn your head
4500000	4502000	and the microphone at the same time.
4502000	4503000	It's not really working too well.
4503000	4505000	You had one job, one job, I gave you.
4505000	4506000	One job.
4506000	4512000	You think I'm sitting like this because I'm comfortable?
4512000	4515000	So yeah, my mom...
4515000	4518000	I'm a Jewish Walter White, in what way?
4518000	4521000	Well, he sold crystal meth and women.
4522000	4524000	Wow.
4524000	4526000	Welcome to the newest guest of Harvard Town.
4526000	4529000	He'll be comtrolling from now on.
4529000	4531000	Was he a chemistry teacher?
4531000	4533000	No, he was a car-staring alarm salesman,
4533000	4536000	so he went from pimping cars to pimping women.
4536000	4538000	You don't hear Jews as pimps.
4538000	4539000	Well, yeah, I know.
4539000	4540000	Now I'm a handler.
4540000	4543000	I know that I am making fun of a Jewish pimp.
4543000	4545000	I'm just so distracted by the math in my head
4545000	4547000	that he sold crystal meth and women,
4547000	4549000	so he had both.
4549000	4550000	Yeah.
4550000	4551000	And he wasn't done?
4551000	4552000	Well, I mean, he...
4552000	4554000	Don't forget car stereos.
4554000	4555000	I mean...
4555000	4556000	Oh, okay.
4556000	4558000	So this guy really craved car stereos
4558000	4560000	and could never get them.
4560000	4563000	I mean, his trinity was he would get hookers
4563000	4565000	to sell crystal meth to guys.
4565000	4566000	Oh, you ain't got to sell us.
4566000	4570000	And then they would fuck the guys and then do the meth,
4570000	4571000	and then when the job was all done,
4571000	4572000	they'd smoke the meth,
4572000	4573000	and then the meth would make them clean,
4573000	4575000	so then everything would be sponsored.
4575000	4577000	Wait, the meth would make them clean?
4577000	4579000	Well, you know, because meth makes you all like,
4579000	4580000	clean like a maid.
4580000	4581000	Oh, clean the house.
4581000	4583000	Yeah, yeah.
4583000	4587000	You were about to buy a shit ton of meth.
4587000	4590000	Meth can make me clean?
4590000	4593000	I would like to try some meth.
4593000	4595000	I'm so dirty.
4595000	4597000	Just got to get that colonic.
4597000	4599000	Oh, my God, yeah.
4599000	4601000	By the way, Levi is obsessed with colonics.
4601000	4603000	I am not obsessed.
4603000	4607000	He keeps asking me to get one because he wants to...
4607000	4610000	I was driving the car the other day, and I go,
4610000	4615000	Levi, I order you to check out getting a colonic for me.
4615000	4618000	And he was like, really? Okay.
4618000	4620000	I know what's happening.
4620000	4624000	I'm more curious, like, if I actually got one...
4624000	4626000	You should be curious about that.
4626000	4629000	I think, for me, like, I would only do it
4629000	4632000	if that meant you absolutely had to do it.
4632000	4634000	It would.
4635000	4638000	We support you.
4638000	4640000	I don't want to do it.
4640000	4642000	What do you mean you don't want to do it?
4642000	4644000	You keep bringing it up.
4644000	4645000	We want you to try stuff.
4645000	4648000	But can we get back to hookers and meth and car stereos?
4648000	4651000	I'm trying to learn something in this motherfucker.
4651000	4654000	Well, now he runs a rehab center off of Melrose.
4654000	4656000	Okay, so now he runs...
4656000	4659000	I don't care about him cleaning himself the fuck up.
4659000	4663000	I want to know, what was your restraining order for?
4663000	4665000	Because he was doing, like, a lot of meth,
4665000	4667000	and that's not good for, like, a grown child.
4667000	4669000	So how old were you at the time?
4669000	4671000	I was, like, 16.
4671000	4673000	So did you have to go to the police department yourself?
4673000	4675000	No, I was a minor. My mom had to go,
4675000	4677000	because the DEA came to our house, and they were like,
4677000	4679000	hey, your dad's doing some shit.
4679000	4681000	Why do you need a restraining order
4681000	4683000	if the DEA has already taken him away?
4683000	4685000	Oh, no, they were looking for him.
4685000	4687000	Oh, and he may come back.
4687000	4688000	Yeah.
4688000	4690000	Is that a friend of yours or one of your dad's bodyguards?
4690000	4692000	No, I have no idea what that is.
4693000	4695000	We just got killed by a Sicario.
4695000	4697000	And what ended up happening to him
4697000	4698000	in your relationship with him?
4698000	4699000	That's why I'm back in L.A.
4699000	4702000	I kind of came back to work on a relationship with him.
4702000	4704000	You should have him on the show.
4705000	4708000	I would if there was a story we thought we could track
4708000	4709000	that would be worth clicks.
4709000	4710000	Yeah, yeah.
4710000	4712000	No, but is he...
4712000	4713000	What has changed?
4713000	4715000	Has there been an arc in terms of you or him?
4715000	4718000	I mean, basically, like, from when I was a kid, like,
4718000	4720000	16, like, it's all started happening,
4720000	4721000	and then, like, slowly but surely,
4721000	4722000	I found out, like, what he was doing.
4722000	4723000	He was in jail.
4723000	4724000	He was a kingpin, all that stuff.
4724000	4725000	Kingpin?
4725000	4726000	Yeah.
4726000	4727000	Jewish kingpin.
4727000	4728000	Did you see this?
4728000	4730000	That was made for me in jail.
4730000	4731000	Oh.
4731000	4732000	Yeah.
4734000	4735000	Wow.
4735000	4736000	Yeah.
4736000	4737000	Did you just touch it?
4737000	4738000	They think for you in jail.
4738000	4739000	Yeah.
4739000	4740000	Wow.
4740000	4741000	Yeah.
4741000	4743000	So, but you're saying what's changed
4743000	4745000	is that the experience has humanized you.
4745000	4748000	At 16, it was so volcanic.
4748000	4749000	Yeah, it was traumatizing.
4749000	4750000	At that age.
4750000	4751000	You got out of there because you're a survivor.
4751000	4752000	Yeah.
4752000	4753000	And as an adult, can I ask how old you are?
4753000	4754000	I'm 25 now, yeah.
4754000	4755000	Okay, so I can ask how old you are.
4755000	4756000	Yeah.
4756000	4757000	Young prick.
4757000	4758000	Of course he can.
4758000	4760000	And he's got weed in his pocket.
4760000	4761000	I know, I do.
4761000	4766000	But as a functioning adult, this is very admirable, 25.
4766000	4767000	Yeah.
4767000	4770000	I'd still be paying my rent off my anger at my dad.
4770000	4773000	I mean, it's, you know, he's paying adult child support,
4773000	4774000	basically, right now.
4774000	4775000	You're looking back, and you're going, like,
4775000	4776000	but who's the guy?
4776000	4777000	Is he in jail now?
4777000	4780000	No, now he's running a rehab center off of Melrose,
4780000	4782000	helping, like, other Jewish and adult people, like,
4782000	4783000	get off the street.
4783000	4786000	There's so many Jewish kingpins.
4786000	4789000	I like the placement of the and there, though.
4789000	4794000	Other Jewish and adult people off the street.
4794000	4798000	So if you're Jewish, you could be a third trimester fetus.
4798000	4800000	And addicted to crack.
4800000	4801000	Right.
4801000	4804000	But so that sounds like I didn't want to force that narrative
4804000	4806000	where it's like, so he's clean now,
4806000	4807000	so it's time to repair it.
4807000	4808000	But it sounds like he is clean.
4808000	4809000	Yeah, he's clean.
4809000	4810000	He's running a rehab center.
4810000	4811000	Yeah, he runs a rehab center now.
4811000	4812000	So it's time to revisit it.
4812000	4813000	And all right, yeah, I won't know.
4813000	4814000	Let's have him on.
4814000	4815000	Yeah, go ahead.
4815000	4819000	Tell him your podcast wants to talk about fathers and sons
4819000	4822000	and all that shit if he wants to come on, for sure.
4822000	4824000	For sure.
4824000	4826000	Who, what about my stained glass company?
4826000	4828000	Well, it's not very interesting.
4828000	4835000	No, I think that's,
4836000	4838000	who am I arguing with in my head?
4838000	4841000	What do I sound like I'm defending myself?
4841000	4843000	Who's attacking me?
4843000	4845000	My girlfriend woke up this morning and she went,
4845000	4846000	oh, baby.
4846000	4848000	And I went, what, what now?
4848000	4850000	And she went, I have a headache.
4850000	4853000	And I went, oh my God, I'm so sorry.
4853000	4857000	I was so fucking ready for women to attack me in the morning.
4857000	4860000	What am I, a fucking weird cyborg?
4860000	4863000	I have so much neurological work to do.
4863000	4867000	Do you believe in neuroplasticity, Fred?
4867000	4871000	I never heard of it, but now I do believe in it.
4871000	4873000	This is when your brain can change throughout time.
4873000	4877000	No, late in life I got into weed because I do believe that,
4877000	4879000	and I tried mushrooms and it didn't work,
4879000	4881000	but I believe things could be better.
4881000	4883000	It didn't work like nothing happened?
4883000	4884000	Yeah.
4884000	4886000	Well, yes and no.
4886000	4889000	Do you want to hear the story?
4889000	4892000	Is Larry David in it?
4892000	4893000	No wrong answers.
4893000	4894000	All right.
4894000	4896000	I'll try to make a long story short.
4896000	4899000	I got into edibles and I like them because I have realizations,
4899000	4903000	revelations where something hits you and it's like in a visual.
4903000	4907000	Wow, and I had a breakthrough and now I won't go back.
4907000	4909000	You know what I mean?
4909000	4910000	And I love that.
4910000	4912000	Someone goes, you really get that on mushrooms.
4912000	4913000	Right.
4913000	4914000	All right.
4914000	4915000	So you always crave that.
4915000	4916000	See, this is an important thing.
4916000	4919000	I want to be like a commentary track that is not,
4919000	4921000	I'm opening the cut.
4921000	4924000	I feel an energy from you when I interrupt you and do my prattling
4924000	4927000	that you're like, Jesus Christ, he's talking and I'm on a fucking track.
4927000	4931000	And earlier you said, I want to get back to that thing
4931000	4933000	so that I can get back to the thing I was talking about.
4933000	4934000	I love him.
4934000	4936000	All right.
4936000	4939000	I'm trying to show I know stuff.
4939000	4941000	Hey.
4941000	4944000	Over the garden wall.
4944000	4946000	I was in that.
4946000	4949000	You like the idea of...
4949000	4950000	Realizations, yes.
4950000	4955000	You don't have anxiety about a bad trip or anything like that.
4955000	4960000	I've had paranoia, but well, it's like anything.
4960000	4963000	It's like if you're in a very bad state,
4963000	4967000	it's going to compound it a thousand percent like the loneliness,
4967000	4968000	the isolation.
4968000	4969000	So I'm smart enough.
4969000	4971000	I got dumped on acid once.
4971000	4972000	By your dad?
4972000	4974000	No, no, by a girl.
4974000	4975000	Oh, you're dead.
4975000	4977000	It was very confusing at the time.
4977000	4978000	Yes.
4978000	4980000	This is something that no one would ever assume about you, though.
4980000	4981000	I guarantee you that.
4981000	4983000	Because the average person...
4983000	4984000	I think I'm so neurotic about it.
4984000	4988000	The average person doesn't do ayahuasca or mushrooms
4988000	4992000	because of the Fred Stoller voice inside of them.
4992000	4996000	So to find out that Fred Stoller, who has that voice...
4996000	4997000	The mushrooms didn't work.
4997000	4999000	...is like, yeah, no, I'll do it.
4999000	5000000	I just don't know how to get it.
5000000	5002000	What happened?
5002000	5003000	Do you buy it at a store?
5003000	5004000	How do you park there?
5004000	5006000	What do you know?
5007000	5010000	How do you keep people from judging you when you're trying to buy ayahuasca?
5010000	5014000	Again, being the old guy in the 80s,
5014000	5016000	the few times I did weed...
5016000	5018000	Yeah, the Fred Stoller and the erotic guy.
5018000	5020000	My throat hurts for three weeks.
5020000	5022000	My sore throat, I'm dizzy.
5022000	5026000	And I don't like alcohol because of the Fred Stoller and the erotic guy.
5026000	5028000	I wake up dry-mouthed three hours later.
5028000	5030000	I'm doing an impression of myself.
5030000	5031000	I'm nauseous.
5031000	5033000	I don't like it.
5033000	5035000	So I thought weed was like...
5035000	5037000	Hey, man, did you move the car?
5037000	5039000	No, I forgot.
5039000	5041000	I go, I don't want that.
5041000	5044000	So, you know, like Brian Posein.
5044000	5046000	You know, hey, man, hey.
5046000	5048000	I like comic books.
5048000	5049000	Yeah.
5049000	5051000	I'm a stoner.
5051000	5054000	So that's what I thought weed is.
5054000	5057000	Just from your observation of other people from the outside.
5057000	5059000	You're like, I don't want to be like that on the inside.
5059000	5060000	But you found out.
5060000	5063000	But then I found out someone said it opens your mind.
5063000	5065000	So it's got more sophisticated.
5065000	5069000	I think in the 80s, when I tried it once or twice, it was just anything.
5069000	5072000	Like I said, sore throat, paranoia.
5072000	5074000	But then, you know, you see on the news, you know...
5074000	5075000	There's strains.
5075000	5077000	There's actually different strains.
5077000	5078000	Yes.
5078000	5080000	And someone said it opens your mind.
5080000	5083000	And then I listened to Sam Harris, who...
5083000	5085000	No, you know who he is.
5085000	5087000	And he's saying...
5088000	5090000	I read the book on tape.
5090000	5091000	One of his...
5091000	5092000	He's got daughters.
5092000	5094000	He goes, I wouldn't like if they did...
5094000	5096000	I'd be concerned if they did meth or crack.
5096000	5099000	But I would want them to try.
5099000	5100000	It opens your mind.
5100000	5101000	Right.
5101000	5102000	And I started thinking about it.
5102000	5103000	So...
5103000	5105000	And I then did some edibles.
5105000	5106000	And I...
5106000	5107000	Yeah.
5107000	5109000	I'd have things where I think I have a funny idea.
5109000	5111000	They never make sense.
5111000	5113000	But I really felt...
5113000	5115000	And I even would meditate.
5115000	5117000	You have a breakthrough where you...
5117000	5119000	It's a visualization where you've got something.
5119000	5123000	And once you've got it, I can't go back to what that was.
5123000	5124000	Right.
5124000	5126000	So someone said mushrooms is better and it wasn't.
5126000	5127000	Mushrooms is...
5127000	5128000	It wasn't.
5128000	5129000	No.
5129000	5130000	It didn't work on you.
5130000	5131000	Come on.
5131000	5132000	Well, the situation...
5132000	5133000	Something happened when you took mushrooms.
5133000	5134000	Okay, tell us the story.
5134000	5135000	Sorry, that's your...
5135000	5136000	Yeah.
5136000	5137000	Ori?
5137000	5138000	Okay.
5138000	5139000	Just checking if I remember the name.
5139000	5140000	Someone...
5140000	5141000	Just buckle up.
5141000	5143000	The lights are warmer up here.
5143000	5144000	Oh, good.
5144000	5147000	Great woman who I don't want to put down.
5147000	5149000	She reached out.
5149000	5152000	She has a boyfriend, but she's seen me on things.
5152000	5155000	Hey, you're an interesting character and I like you.
5155000	5156000	Not like me that way.
5156000	5157000	But she said...
5157000	5162000	And she saw me on some podcast talking about weed.
5162000	5163000	No, she does weed.
5163000	5167000	So she met me and she got me a $40 top joint thing.
5167000	5168000	She saw you on the podcast.
5168000	5171000	Like Douglas movies or the thing where you smoke or whatever.
5171000	5172000	Excellent.
5172000	5173000	No, I didn't do Douglas movies.
5173000	5176000	A lot of podcasts have live video feeds now for $5 a month.
5176000	5177000	You can subscribe.
5177000	5180000	Is there one that you might know of offhand?
5180000	5181000	Yeah, no.
5181000	5182000	The one where you smoke weed.
5182000	5183000	Yes.
5183000	5185000	I did that one with Doug Benson.
5185000	5187000	And again, that's another guy.
5187000	5188000	You don't think of him as a breakthrough.
5188000	5189000	It's like...
5189000	5191000	You know, so...
5191000	5195000	But she goes, you know, talking about that, I go,
5195000	5197000	I'd like to do mushrooms, but how do you do it?
5197000	5198000	She goes, I'll get you some.
5198000	5200000	You know, we'll do it.
5200000	5202000	And...
5202000	5203000	Can I interrupt here?
5203000	5204000	Yes.
5204000	5205000	She's local.
5205000	5206000	She's in your life physically.
5206000	5210000	Or are you connected with her online?
5210000	5213000	She sort me out through Twitter or whatever the hell,
5213000	5216000	but it wasn't like a catfish because we had mutual friends.
5216000	5217000	So it wasn't so psychotic.
5217000	5218000	Well, I wasn't thinking...
5218000	5221000	I just want to know, like, is she a person, like,
5221000	5224000	because I'm trying to figure out, like...
5224000	5225000	Who she is?
5225000	5226000	No.
5226000	5227000	God, no.
5227000	5228000	No, no, no.
5228000	5230000	No, I'm trying to figure out how much of this was like...
5231000	5234000	Your anxiety was mitigated by, like, this is a person...
5234000	5235000	I felt very interested and familiar.
5235000	5236000	You were interested and it was drawing you in.
5236000	5239000	It was saying, like, she trusted...
5239000	5240000	I trusted her.
5240000	5241000	You trusted her.
5241000	5242000	Totally.
5242000	5243000	And this is how you met her, but you met her online,
5243000	5245000	but then you were going to meet her, maybe?
5245000	5246000	Yes.
5246000	5247000	We met and she had to join.
5247000	5251000	And I just, you know, we talked and I said,
5251000	5252000	I never did that.
5252000	5253000	I'm curious.
5253000	5256000	And I had a birthday a few months ago
5256000	5257000	where I'm tired of every birthday.
5257000	5259000	You sit around with eight friends.
5259000	5262000	You know, yeah, yeah, my friends and the check comes.
5262000	5264000	You know, I want to do something adventuresome.
5264000	5266000	The check comes.
5266000	5268000	So I said, I want to do mushrooms.
5268000	5271000	And so then...
5274000	5277000	That's your description of a birthday?
5278000	5282000	I mean, by no means do I claim that birthdays are fun,
5282000	5285000	but your description of a birthday...
5285000	5287000	Oh, it gets more ridiculous.
5287000	5290000	He's fine to get killed himself.
5290000	5291000	Yes.
5291000	5292000	You sit around a table.
5292000	5293000	Well, it's always the same eight people.
5293000	5294000	Seven to eight friends.
5294000	5295000	You go, yeah, I'm older.
5295000	5296000	The check comes.
5296000	5297000	Yes.
5297000	5298000	And everyone's dipping it up.
5298000	5303000	You sound like the way a rock would describe DNA.
5303000	5307000	Like, oh, yeah, you shape yourself different than you reproduce.
5307000	5309000	It's always the same restaurant and it's eight...
5309000	5311000	Yeah, the same eight people.
5311000	5312000	They're all very nice.
5312000	5313000	So I'm always alone.
5313000	5314000	Seriously?
5314000	5315000	Yeah.
5315000	5316000	Yeah.
5316000	5317000	And no significant other.
5317000	5319000	So basically...
5319000	5322000	So I said, I want to do something crazy, you know.
5322000	5327000	And so there's another female comedian who once in all...
5327000	5328000	She heard about the animals.
5328000	5330000	She goes, let's do animals.
5330000	5333000	She texts me and I go, well, I want to try mushrooms.
5333000	5335000	Yeah, let's do that.
5335000	5337000	And so I wanted to bring her there.
5337000	5339000	So it's three of us.
5339000	5342000	Just, you know, I don't want to be uncomfortable and, you know, be sexual.
5342000	5343000	I don't know.
5343000	5344000	I thought it's like ecstasy.
5344000	5346000	Yeah, you know, you're kissing and, you know...
5346000	5348000	Which ecstasy isn't, just so you know.
5348000	5349000	Okay.
5349000	5350000	Like, I just did it with...
5350000	5353000	I haven't done it with...
5353000	5354000	That was one of the...
5354000	5356000	Ecstasy is like synthetic mushrooms.
5356000	5359000	It's like mushrooms in a salary cap.
5359000	5364000	Is this being homophobic if I say, I was afraid to do mushrooms with a friend
5364000	5367000	because I thought, oh, you start making out with a guy, everyone says.
5367000	5369000	You make out with whoever you're with.
5369000	5371000	Well, no, not that guy.
5371000	5372000	Okay.
5372000	5373000	Well, so...
5373000	5374000	Okay.
5374000	5375000	That's poppers.
5375000	5376000	I don't want to...
5376000	5377000	So there was...
5377000	5378000	It's like...
5378000	5379000	But you weren't afraid...
5379000	5380000	Here, let me...
5380000	5381000	All right.
5381000	5382000	I'm a hypocrite, right?
5382000	5383000	No, no.
5383000	5384000	I wasn't afraid with two women.
5384000	5385000	Where would you get that part?
5385000	5386000	All right, all right.
5386000	5387000	I can't even finish my...
5387000	5390000	Because of my self-loathing, I can't finish my question before you're answering with your
5390000	5391000	self-loathing.
5391000	5392000	Yes.
5392000	5393000	I'm saying...
5393000	5395000	Here, let me lay out...
5395000	5399000	I was hoping the woman that has a girlfriend may be something with her.
5400000	5405000	When I was in my 20s, I think I probably, if anybody said, this is mushrooms.
5405000	5407000	That's why I did mushrooms.
5407000	5408000	That's why I did acid.
5408000	5411000	Because I was in my 20s.
5411000	5416000	And when you're in your 20s, you're just driving into trees because you're like, why can't
5416000	5417000	I die?
5420000	5424000	People just hand you pizza and go, this has been out for three days.
5424000	5426000	And you're like, why not four?
5427000	5430000	Because you can't wait to feel pain.
5430000	5432000	And you will someday.
5432000	5433000	You will.
5433000	5436000	I got food poisoning at one point in my 30s.
5436000	5437000	I got...
5437000	5438000	You know, everything...
5438000	5440000	I had bad trips in my 30s and stuff.
5440000	5442000	But when I was in my 20s, which is what...
5442000	5448000	That's when I feel like my roster of drugs that I was willing to do was completed.
5448000	5450000	Because it's like the map of the world.
5450000	5451000	Here there be dragons and stuff.
5451000	5456000	So it's like, okay, I'll never try heroin because I made it to 30 without doing heroin.
5456000	5457000	Thank God.
5457000	5460000	So now I'll never do it.
5460000	5461000	So I had...
5461000	5462000	This is what...
5462000	5468000	But the fear, the Fred Stoller voice inside of me that would not want to do mushrooms,
5468000	5473000	wouldn't want to not do mushrooms because I'd be afraid of anything that would happen
5473000	5475000	because of a successful mushroom trip.
5475000	5478000	It would be afraid of an unsuccessful mushroom trip.
5478000	5479000	People reassured me.
5479000	5480000	Okay.
5480000	5481000	So this is what happened.
5481000	5484000	The woman said, I'll be a mushroom coach.
5484000	5485000	I'm here for you.
5485000	5486000	I was a trip advisor.
5486000	5487000	That's fun.
5487000	5489000	She goes, if you're freaking out, I'll take you aside.
5489000	5495000	So you've been told this drug represents such a threshold that the worst case scenario
5495000	5497000	was women taking care of you.
5497000	5498000	Yes.
5498000	5499000	I'm starting to come around.
5499000	5502000	Now this is what I was seeking was like, I'm not judging you.
5502000	5503000	No, please judge.
5503000	5507000	I'm like, you're still bolder than me because you're outside of your...
5507000	5512000	The fact that the story starts with you saying, I want to try mushrooms, I just wouldn't
5512000	5513000	have done it.
5513000	5514000	I would have looked for...
5514000	5520560	Well, again, I like that the realizations, I'm very into meditating and Duncan Trussell
5520560	5523000	again got me into Ram Dass and all this stuff.
5523000	5525000	Ram Dass ain't no joke.
5525000	5526000	No.
5526000	5528000	You know who he is?
5528000	5529000	You will the runner.
5529000	5530000	You know who he is?
5530000	5531000	I know who he is.
5531000	5532000	He ain't no joke, bro.
5532000	5534500	Ram Dass ain't to be fucked with.
5534500	5536200	As much as you know about my book.
5536200	5540960	You can go back two episodes and he seeds Ram Dass ain't no joke as a runner for no
5540960	5541960	seeming reason.
5541960	5544300	You're a time traveler, aren't you?
5544300	5547720	You set yourself up for a callback.
5547720	5549080	You're Marty McFly.
5549080	5550080	The reason I do...
5550080	5553040	Ram Dass ain't no joke made no sense back then.
5553040	5555560	Now it's a callback.
5555560	5556560	Everyone go back.
5556560	5557560	Everyone stop listening to this episode.
5557560	5558560	Go back two episodes.
5558560	5562040	He said, Ram Dass ain't no joke in this weird voice.
5562040	5563040	All right.
5563040	5564040	I bought it though.
5564040	5566040	I'm getting drugged, sorry.
5566040	5567040	No, no.
5567040	5569560	The reason I'm doing it later in life is I don't have any guilt.
5569560	5573520	You know, I fucked around my 20s, 30s, 40s, my 50s.
5573520	5577680	It's like, you know, I tried my hardest to meet women and write and do the career.
5577680	5579520	And you made it to now to visit...
5579520	5580520	You look fantastic.
5580520	5581520	Oh, yeah.
5581520	5582520	That was...
5582520	5583520	That's layering in why I was mentioning that.
5583520	5584520	Yeah.
5584520	5585520	No.
5585520	5586520	You have the American dream.
5586520	5588400	You may as well fucking put your dick under a bulldozer.
5588400	5593000	When Edible works right, I feel I could be in Hawaii when I'm lying in my bed, you know.
5593000	5595400	It's time to find out you're into anything.
5595400	5596400	Yes.
5596400	5597800	Now, was it a tea?
5597800	5598800	She make a tea.
5598800	5599800	No, no.
5599800	5600800	So what she did was...
5600800	5601800	All right.
5601800	5602800	So this is what I thought.
5602800	5604280	They said, you can't do mushrooms in your apartment.
5604280	5607720	You've got to be on the beach and the beautiful in Malibu.
5607720	5608720	So I said, but...
5608720	5609720	Yes.
5609720	5611280	So she said, you got to get a room.
5611280	5617680	So I rented a room and that way we could go out, come back in, yes, sleep the morning,
5617680	5618760	wake up.
5618760	5624680	So I spend my money and I'm not that rich on a place in Malibu for the night.
5624680	5629160	And she goes, okay, I'm your mushroom coach if it gets too much and this and that.
5629160	5636600	So me, her and the third very nice woman, we go to check into the hotel and she...
5636600	5639320	It's like that candy wrap you wrap it in.
5639320	5640320	You know what I'm saying?
5640320	5641320	Like, I don't know.
5641320	5642320	The taffy...
5642320	5643320	Cellophane?
5643320	5644320	You're just describing cellophane?
5644320	5645320	No.
5645320	5646320	Food.
5646320	5647320	But it's like that...
5647320	5648320	Oh, they make a mushroom.
5648320	5649320	They made like a mushroom taffy.
5649320	5650320	Yes.
5650320	5653720	So right away I'm throwing some things off because I'm eating it, no problem.
5653760	5657920	Yeah, this tastes like shit the mushroom coach is saying.
5657920	5663320	So then we go across the street to Malibu and right away it hits her and she's lying
5663320	5671960	in the sand and I'm picking her up and this is the coach.
5671960	5675880	And this guy, the only thing that hit me, I was paranoid, the guy who owned the house
5675880	5679600	was Martin Sheen because I know he lives in Malibu and he's looking and there's a girl
5679600	5683680	lying in the sand because I'm going to throw up and he's on the phone, I go, you got to
5683680	5684680	get out of here.
5684680	5686680	So I'm not really feeling anything.
5686680	5687680	I'm sorry.
5687680	5688680	The track...
5688680	5691640	Martin Sheen, is that just something that bleeped into your head because...
5691640	5692640	Yes.
5692640	5693640	Maybe I was a little paranoid.
5693640	5694640	That's the only paranoia.
5694640	5695640	He wasn't there.
5695640	5696640	See, I could have been...
5696640	5699320	I don't know if you were like, the only one I knew was Martin Sheen and he's there and
5699320	5700320	he's on the phone.
5700320	5701320	No, but I know you live in Malibu.
5701320	5704160	You're saying you're imagining in your head Martin Sheen is looking out down and...
5704160	5705160	No, but it wasn't.
5705160	5706160	I picked up a phone.
5706160	5707160	I think that might be Fred Stolu.
5707160	5711440	Looking up a phone is a woman walking and turning in the sand and I'm trying to lift
5711440	5712440	her up.
5712440	5715420	So the other woman ran off to get water.
5715420	5719280	She said she's going to throw up.
5719280	5720680	So then the only...
5720680	5722200	I think I did it for fun.
5722200	5727200	I pretended we were like DD on the beach and she was a wounded soldier and I have to get
5727200	5728780	her back to the hotel.
5728780	5735120	So she's the coach and I'm escorting her and we're just taking her and then all of a sudden
5735120	5740680	I start narrating it because I go, people are walking by, I go, look at these people.
5740680	5746200	They have houses and lives and their dogs and their kids and I'm the 59 year old guy
5746200	5752560	with two women trying mushrooms on my birthday and I'm saying that out loud and people are
5752560	5756320	walking.
5756320	5760880	So then you notice a tunnel that goes from the beach to in Malibu to this...
5760880	5761880	So she couldn't take it anymore.
5761880	5767320	She's going to throw up and she's wording, is that the word, on the floor?
5767320	5771800	And then this guy comes by with his family and he goes, what's wrong?
5771800	5781160	And I go, oh, she got nauseous looking at the water and he goes, she got seasick on
5781160	5782160	the beach.
5782160	5784560	And that has nothing to do with the story but I have to say it, he goes, don't go on
5784560	5788400	a cruise then and gave her some advice, don't go on the cruises.
5788400	5789400	You can do the voice.
5789400	5790400	Okay.
5791400	5792400	Yes.
5792400	5793400	I missed that.
5793400	5794400	You're waving.
5794400	5798600	By the way, he's like, yeah, do the, do the, because that's the punchline of the story.
5798600	5800520	Don't go on no cruises.
5800520	5801520	That's not your black guy voice.
5801520	5802720	That's not a good voice.
5802720	5803720	So can I do it?
5803720	5804720	I'll do it.
5804720	5805720	Yeah.
5805720	5806720	Don't go on a cruise then motherfucker.
5806720	5807720	I don't know.
5807720	5808720	Awful.
5808720	5809720	I don't know.
5809720	5810720	He was being humble.
5810720	5811720	I assume that he grew up in Pittsburgh.
5811720	5812720	He wasn't mad.
5812720	5813720	He wasn't Mr. T.
5813720	5820240	I was trying to make a shady spot so that he could have a picnic.
5821240	5824240	I thought I'd take the hit.
5824240	5828600	I thought I'd create a racist canopy so that he could be like, here's what he really sounded
5828600	5829600	like.
5829600	5832560	Like the waves of mail are so crazy.
5832560	5833560	You look at them.
5833560	5834560	You can't walk.
5834560	5837720	You know, you have to have two people escort you.
5837720	5839640	So then she, oh, I forgot this part.
5839640	5841440	The mushroom coach gave good advice.
5841440	5845400	If you need to have a bowel movement, do it before it kicks in.
5845400	5847920	So that was an erotic Jew in me, Andy Kindler.
5847920	5854440	Oh, I got to make a and oh, did I not go just because taking a shit on mushrooms will
5854440	5857920	make you feel like you're the universe's asshole.
5857920	5861640	I'm trying to figure out what why that is.
5861640	5862640	I love that.
5862640	5863640	That's a document.
5863640	5868320	That's like, by the way, that's as clean as like, throw the throw the grenade, not the
5868320	5869320	pin.
5869320	5870320	Yeah.
5870320	5871320	Take a shit.
5871320	5872320	You pour the mushrooms.
5872320	5876560	I understand that because your turn will be infinite.
5876560	5879360	I'm having the go and you're tripping.
5879360	5880360	It won't work.
5880360	5881360	I don't know.
5881360	5883400	So then she goes, I got a shit I got to throw up.
5883400	5887460	So here she gave the advice so she could get me back to the room.
5887460	5890920	So so she goes, you got to get out.
5890920	5892160	I need the room.
5892160	5897000	So so we leave her there and she's, you know, probably doing what she's got to do.
5897000	5900360	And then my my phone battery died.
5900360	5901360	I go to charge it.
5901360	5902760	Get out of here.
5902760	5905200	You know, don't open the fucking light.
5905200	5907440	And so we had to stand by the door.
5907440	5909640	Wait, you got to back up because we don't know.
5909640	5912760	I'm with you the entire way.
5912760	5915160	There's people attacking, you know, we don't know.
5915160	5917640	I would try to come in the hotel room I paid for.
5917640	5918640	Right.
5918640	5919640	To charge my battery.
5919640	5920640	Right.
5920640	5921640	And she goes, get the fuck out of here.
5921640	5922640	Who said that?
5922640	5923640	The mushroom coach.
5923640	5924640	The mushroom coach.
5924640	5925640	Now known as the deuce dropper.
5925640	5926640	Yes.
5926640	5928160	Oh, because she didn't like it.
5928160	5929160	She was freaking out.
5929160	5930160	Okay.
5930160	5931440	She was freaking out.
5931440	5932440	She was okay.
5932440	5933440	We were both.
5933520	5937320	We didn't know it was getting dark and chilly and was standing outside the door and we're
5937320	5938720	not allowed in.
5938720	5944160	So we couldn't I guess it didn't work because we were like, we got to save the coach.
5944160	5946480	And so I didn't have any guys.
5946480	5950080	The only realization I had was the comedian.
5950080	5954440	I was with she I go, you look like Bonnie McFarland.
5954440	5955880	I would never realize that.
5955880	5956880	It's a realization.
5956880	5957880	Yes.
5957880	5962280	That's the only thing that I realized it was Bonnie McFarland.
5962280	5967360	But you did live through, although no one would pay money for this, the experience of
5967360	5971760	oh, what would I do if I was in charge of a person that I thought was supposed to be
5971760	5972760	in charge of me?
5972760	5973760	Yes.
5973760	5974760	That's a fucking valuable experience.
5974760	5976800	No, I felt very proud in machismo.
5976800	5979480	It's not birthday valuable.
5979480	5981200	I would have you have a better birthday.
5981200	5982200	No, it didn't.
5982200	5989280	And I have to say she's a sweet woman and she was very ashamed.
5989280	5995700	And so the woman that the other woman who was OK, she has a girlfriend that said get
5995700	5997240	down to wherever she lives.
5997240	5999200	Where does Ray Donovan take place near Malibu?
5999200	6005640	I forgot in a world where secrecy is your last option.
6005640	6008640	So her girlfriend kept saying, get over here, get over here.
6008640	6010800	And she didn't want to let her know she was stoned.
6010800	6012280	She goes, I'm at a birthday party.
6012280	6013280	And she didn't believe her.
6013280	6018840	So we had to go to a restaurant and take pictures pretending I got I think the beginnings of
6018840	6019840	your stories.
6019840	6023680	I have packets of information in them that I miss because I'm an afterglow from your
6023680	6024680	last story.
6024680	6025680	Right.
6025680	6028360	So I think that's what it is because you change locations and casts.
6028360	6029360	Yes.
6029360	6034360	I was trying to say it was so crazy that the other woman we were outside the door afraid
6034360	6037240	to go in, you know, because she kept screaming, get out of here.
6037240	6038240	I'm I'm freaking out.
6038240	6039240	I just want to lay there.
6039240	6040240	Yes.
6040240	6043160	She didn't want to be with anybody while she was freaking out.
6043160	6044160	Yeah.
6044160	6045160	I always make it.
6045160	6047160	Everyone else's problem.
6047160	6053960	If I'm having a single issue with anything, like society is the first place I go.
6053960	6056840	Wipe my ass on everything.
6056840	6058800	That's why the election made me so upset.
6058800	6060200	I'm like, I'm alone.
6060200	6062440	I can't wipe my ass on anybody.
6062440	6064360	They're all wiping their ass on each other.
6064360	6066080	I was like, this is fucked up.
6066080	6068680	I didn't mean to bring it back to that.
6068680	6069680	No.
6069680	6072480	So that was the mushrooms of my birthday.
6072480	6074040	So you never tried mushrooms again.
6074040	6075040	No.
6075040	6076440	But I'd like to.
6076440	6082480	My bad mushroom chips are like when you have bad mushrooms, you I got a pain in my neck
6082480	6087520	and I thought I was I looked in a mirror and I thought I was a walrus and I like like like
6087520	6089080	they're kind of like bad mushrooms.
6089080	6091800	And so it's like like it's basically like acid.
6091800	6097440	But so it's there's still a silo silo silo silo.
6097440	6099760	I'll get it eventually.
6099760	6103920	We'll edit it back in when we do the bad mic pass.
6103920	6104920	Yeah.
6104920	6105920	Yeah.
6105920	6106920	Yeah.
6106920	6107920	Yeah.
6107920	6108920	Yeah.
6108920	6109920	Yeah.
6109920	6110920	Yeah.
6110920	6111920	Yeah.
6111920	6112920	Yeah.
6112920	6113920	Okay.
6113920	6120520	So mushrooms, they've researched, I guess I want to urge you because you're fucking bold
6120520	6123680	and badass and a guy that says it's my 59th birthday.
6123680	6124680	Let's do mushrooms.
6124680	6125680	Please do them again.
6125680	6126680	I think you'll enjoy them.
6126680	6127680	No.
6127680	6128680	What about acid?
6128680	6129680	If people are micro dosing now.
6129680	6130680	Micro Joes.
6130680	6131680	It's so good.
6131680	6137400	So good that his father's rehab center is doing to acid.
6137400	6138400	Don't do math.
6138400	6139400	Do acid.
6139400	6140400	Yeah.
6140400	6144640	He's really become his father in his bad years.
6144640	6145640	Do acid.
6145640	6147880	I mean, my dad's a Jew.
6147880	6148880	Hoffman was a Jew.
6148880	6149880	We're all Jews.
6149880	6155080	No, I'm not looking to do anything ridiculous, but I like expanding the mind.
6155080	6157000	Have you done ecstasy, MDMA?
6157000	6158000	No.
6158000	6159000	No.
6159000	6160000	That's really easy.
6160000	6161000	Yeah.
6161000	6162000	That's a fun one.
6162000	6163000	That kind of can't go wrong.
6163000	6167200	I'm scared that I would do harm to my cat.
6167200	6169200	Over petting it.
6169200	6170200	No.
6170200	6172080	Just pet him bone dry.
6172080	6178360	The cat's like, Jesus Christ, you have my number.
6178360	6179520	You have the job.
6179520	6181400	You give me food.
6181400	6187640	I don't know what you ate tonight, but I was already at an equilibrium spot.
6187640	6189480	We had a business going here.
6189480	6191000	I miss my cat so much.
6191000	6194080	I miss that kind of affection that the kind of cat can't fucking buy.
6194080	6195080	I lost two.
6195080	6196080	One was 18.
6196080	6197080	One was 19.
6197080	6198280	And I wasn't going to get another.
6198280	6201600	But someone got one from a shelter and the other cat wasn't getting along.
6201600	6203520	So I'm glad it happened.
6203520	6205960	I mean, yeah, the cat is the.
6205960	6206960	I love my dogs.
6206960	6207960	I can't believe I got dogs.
6207960	6210280	And I sit with them and they're like, what are you doing?
6210280	6214000	And I'm like, it's called nothing.
6214000	6216280	You're supposed to enjoy it.
6216720	6218240	They're like, just throw the thing.
6218240	6224480	I'm like, if I throw it, you'll just bring it back.
6224480	6227800	And they're like, yeah, well, they're no, they're not like, yeah.
6227800	6229920	Because if they were like, yeah, then it'd be sentient.
6229920	6231240	But they're like, no, throw it.
6231240	6232240	Throw it.
6232240	6233240	Damn.
6233240	6240560	And I'm like, I'm telling you I'm from the future because my brain's bigger than a peanut.
6240560	6245520	You're just going to keep bringing it back and I'm telling you that you're never going
6245520	6247520	to understand this as a species.
6247520	6253520	It never gets any better than sitting under a tree, grooming another monkey and waiting
6253520	6256080	to die.
6256080	6260760	And if a spotted leopard comes around, you go.
6260760	6264200	And you all go to safety until the spotted leopards gone.
6264200	6268480	And that is where humans started fucking up because we had nailed it.
6268480	6274600	And then one was like, what if a spaceship and they were like, you're great, Carl.
6275600	6279000	But Carl's not bad either because those chimps are going to die anyway.
6279000	6280000	I'm sorry.
6280000	6281000	I harp on this a lot.
6281000	6286400	I saw the documentary of Coco, the sign language in Guarello with my friend who was so cynical
6286400	6291120	going, there's all these theories, Coco didn't really know sign language.
6291120	6294880	He's just copying and really bothered me.
6294880	6296080	Your friend bothered you or Coco?
6296080	6301080	My friend bothered me that he had to, that his cosmology was so specific that it was
6301080	6303880	important to him that Coco, no sign language.
6303880	6305280	Yeah, Coco's full of shit.
6305280	6306280	It doesn't really sign.
6306280	6309160	I find myself wondering that all the time.
6309160	6312920	When you're with somebody and you're like, wait, what's with the pushback at this point?
6312920	6313920	Yes.
6313920	6314920	You know?
6314920	6315920	Let's examine this.
6315920	6316920	It's like a chiropractor.
6316920	6317920	Examine Coco.
6317920	6322960	They had a 30-year scam that Coco was just copying and not really signing.
6322960	6326720	It's not even like I'm open to finding out that Coco's full of shit.
6326720	6328120	I'm totally open to it.
6328120	6334160	I find it weird when you meet the guy that's like, Coco's full of shit.
6334160	6335640	I know it.
6335640	6337400	It's not a tested hypothesis.
6337400	6341360	It's just a strong belief.
6341360	6348120	You're like the guy in Awakenings, but if you wanted monkeys to not talk.
6348120	6352120	It's weird to have that strong an opinion given that there's no stakes to being proven
6352120	6353120	right.
6353120	6355560	The only thing that happens if you're proven right is...
6355560	6359000	They got a documentary about Coco is what they got.
6359000	6363400	Do you know Pat Sajak was a global warming guy?
6363400	6365160	That bummed me out so much.
6365160	6367080	Politics and the internet ruin everything.
6367080	6371520	Turns out Pat Sajak is a global warming denier.
6371520	6377840	His tweets at a certain point were like, follow the money.
6377840	6382600	Follow the money.
6382600	6383600	Global warming.
6383600	6384600	Yes, yes.
6384680	6392880	Right now someone is making a billion dollars by you believing the world is getting hotter.
6392880	6401080	It's like a cartoon or a game show where people spell common phrases.
6401080	6405480	You want Pat Sajak to walk off screen off a Wheel of Fortune, you want him to slide
6405480	6411920	down a pole into like a den with a banner rug and solve crimes or something that are
6411920	6415240	based on rudimentary English.
6415240	6416240	Or just enjoy his life.
6416240	6418800	I don't care if he jerks off at a bowl and drinks it.
6418800	6421240	I want him to be happy.
6421240	6426840	I want someone to affirm the myth of retirement to me.
6426840	6430040	Why is it the higher you look, the less happy everybody is?
6430040	6431720	What are these guys?
6431720	6435640	Rupert Fire Moon died today.
6435640	6439000	He had 95 divorces.
6439000	6441480	His face was a scowl.
6441480	6444160	He owned 900,000 newspapers.
6444160	6447160	He could tell three countries what to think.
6447160	6453320	But no one ever saw him smile because he died.
6453320	6454320	Where does it go?
6454320	6456400	Where does David Hasselhoff was night rider?
6456400	6458680	He can't stop drinking long enough to go night rider?
6458680	6462520	I thought he had the rights for the Baywatch, I thought he made a lot of money.
6462520	6465120	I don't care about him.
6465120	6469680	Because I'm looking for one person to show me the path.
6469680	6474240	Because otherwise, then it's me, I'm going like, okay, so I have to sit in my bed and
6474240	6479720	I have to like just jerk off on my girlfriend.
6479720	6481000	And watch Star Trek.
6481000	6482720	You don't have to.
6482720	6489800	No, I'm saying if I want to win the game of life, the way I have to do it is not owning
6489800	6491120	nine airplanes.
6491120	6493680	It is like exactly what I have right now.
6493680	6499200	And then you go, okay, so whoa, oh, so now I wait to die.
6499200	6500200	That's not fun.
6500200	6507040	I don't want to, no, no, no, no.
6507040	6508040	Expand your horizons.
6508040	6509040	Get out of bed.
6509040	6510040	Let me do mushrooms.
6510040	6511040	I want to.
6511040	6512040	Yeah.
6512040	6513040	Okay.
6513040	6514040	You know, let me, let me ask you again.
6514040	6515040	I don't mean to.
6515040	6516040	I want to check.
6516040	6517040	I wouldn't.
6517040	6518040	Okay.
6518040	6519040	I know.
6519040	6521120	I think we just had our first perfect show.
6521120	6523280	I was just looking for the first time.
6523280	6524560	And you were here.
6525560	6532360	I'm, I'm not as, I'm not depressed these days because I like being creative.
6532360	6535840	I'm not being an asshole plugging my stupid Kindle signals and books.
6535840	6536840	Oh yeah.
6536840	6537840	Yeah.
6537840	6538840	Yeah.
6538840	6539840	Let's plug your book for sure.
6539840	6540840	It's called five minutes to kill.
6540840	6543280	It's about the 1989 young comedian special met.
6543280	6546880	You guys, I don't know if you remember each way you said these big young comedian specials.
6546880	6550880	A lot of people were launched and I wrote about the one I was on because I found it
6550880	6556480	interesting, the trajectory and the diversity of the careers and lives, two of them made
6556480	6557480	it big.
6557480	6562600	Rob Schneider and David Spade, they were discovered from the young comedian special.
6562600	6568560	Two of them had tragedies, Warren Thomas and Drake Sather, or Warren Thomas was the best.
6568560	6569560	Yeah.
6569560	6570560	Yeah.
6570560	6572240	And one woman, she's, she's beautiful.
6572240	6573620	She's struggling.
6573620	6580240	So I kind of interviewed widows and people and it's like those like 30 by thirties, like
6580240	6585080	this is a college team that was, they were all supposed to be pros to made it, to didn't.
6585080	6592840	So is this you checking in with the, so it starts in 1989 with, um, six young hopeful
6592840	6599440	people and I wasn't so young, even in 1989 as a comedian, but this is our big break to
6599440	6600840	young comedian special.
6600840	6605960	And then what happens right away, Schneider and, uh, you can call him Schneider here.
6605960	6611480	Schneider gets his break.
6611480	6616200	They get their breaks and Warren Thomas had an opportunity to be on Saturday Night Live
6616200	6617200	is the black guy.
6617200	6620720	I'm, I'm looking at you and, uh, that's so sticky.
6620720	6624360	Was Warren Thomas the, did he have a like Mike Tyson impression?
6624360	6625360	Yes.
6625360	6627360	I'm going to put my dick in the butter.
6627360	6628360	Yeah.
6628360	6633080	So he was this guy that, um, he, there's a thing on Saturday Night Live, you're talking
6633080	6634840	about the exact special that I remember.
6634840	6636960	I'm like fifth or I don't know.
6636960	6637960	Okay.
6637960	6638960	19 in Milwaukee.
6638960	6639960	I don't know.
6639960	6640960	I really liked it.
6640960	6641960	And then it's the HBO.
6641960	6642960	Yeah.
6642960	6643960	And it was, it was.
6643960	6644960	Yeah.
6644960	6645960	Okay.
6645960	6649080	Rob Schneider, David Spade, um, Drake Sather and Jan Karam.
6649080	6655600	Jan Karam was a precursor to all the beautiful, like Whitney Cummings and, uh, Sarah and women
6655600	6660240	who were hot and she was really beautiful, but she didn't own her hotness.
6660240	6662200	Like, Hey, I'm making guys come.
6662200	6663600	I'm not saying they do those jokes.
6664360	6665360	Sort of like Keitlinger.
6665360	6666360	Yeah.
6666360	6667360	That kind of type of stuff.
6667360	6670360	So she was, uh, really ahead of her time in that way with comedy.
6670360	6671360	So yeah.
6671360	6676240	So I follow from after our quote unquote break, Warren Thomas, um, when there's a ritual
6676240	6681640	I didn't know about that when you meet, uh, Lauren Michaels, he makes you wait like four
6681640	6682640	hours.
6682640	6684560	It's just a, uh, initiation.
6684560	6685560	And he said, fuck this.
6685560	6689480	And he left and ended up going to Chris Rock, that spot.
6689480	6695800	So it's just, so it just takes us to 2017 following the triumph and the tragedy of the
6695800	6698160	six people on it, including myself.
6698160	6699160	That's great.
6699160	6701640	I don't have to pronounce that.
6701640	6702640	That sounds great.
6702640	6703640	I do.
6703640	6705560	Um, so I forgot, oh yeah.
6705560	6710260	So I, and my Seinfeld year was the, so what I'm trying to say is I'm happiest being creative
6710260	6712080	and just writing things in my own voice.
6712080	6718080	So the theory I have is, and maybe antidepressants help, but no, I'm, I'm happiest when I'm being
6718080	6723080	creative, not trying to fit into puzzles is that depression serves a purpose.
6723080	6725840	Cause then you're not afraid to die and we're all going to die.
6725840	6731640	So, so I wonder if depression to hear you talk, that's why you need to be pitching television
6731640	6737160	shows, but none of you, but when I'm depressed, you're, I'm more in tune because when I'm
6737160	6741080	really depressed, I go, why did my wasting time with shorter and Instagram, I'm more
6741080	6743840	in tune and in touch and in reality.
6743840	6747680	So maybe depression is the real thing we're supposed to be.
6747680	6754080	I wonder cause now I don't want to die and I'd be afraid to, no, I don't want to, which
6754080	6755080	is good, right?
6755080	6758880	But maybe, but, but, but I'm very depressed.
6758880	6759920	I'm not afraid of it.
6759920	6760920	I welcome it.
6760920	6763200	So maybe depression makes more sense.
6763200	6764200	Does this make sense?
6764200	6765200	Well, depression is practical.
6765200	6766200	Yes.
6766200	6770800	It is certainly, it is more practical than avoiding it than thinking that it's wrong
6770800	6771960	and everything's great.
6771960	6776680	You might be, there's, let's say there's two types of something for once in our lives.
6776680	6779200	I know we hate saying there's two types of things.
6779200	6782240	Let's say there's two types of depression and let's say that the two types of depression
6782240	6789840	are unfucking controllable biochemical depression, where as we all know, if you're in a bad mood
6789840	6793480	and you get a flat tire, your flat tire is the end of your world.
6793480	6797520	If you're in a good mood and you get a flat tire, it's kind of funny you got a flat tire.
6797520	6802400	If you're in a good mood and you win $500 in a scratch off, it's, it's, it's fucking
6802400	6803400	fantastic.
6803400	6809520	If you're in a bad mood and you win $500 in a scratch off, it's like evidence that capitalism
6809520	6813480	has its, and so on and so forth.
6813480	6820280	Like, like, like mood matters more than fact, especially when you relate it to fact.
6820280	6823920	So like, fuck, I forgot why I was talking about this, why I got all excited about it.
6823920	6824920	But is it more practical?
6824920	6829440	Because if you do not be afraid of death, if you be depressed, if whether or not either
6829440	6835080	of whichever of those things are true, whether you are biochemically uncontrollably depressed
6835080	6840760	or whether it's actually there's the other situation, which is like kind of like, yeah,
6840760	6844680	you know what, there's been like five bad things that have happened and it's kind of
6844680	6851680	hard to be in a good mood today and I was being glib when I said there was two kinds
6851680	6854800	because it's like it's a combination of things.
6854800	6855880	It doesn't matter.
6855880	6862840	Your bad mood still means the exact same thing and committing to your bad mood is still
6862840	6865240	practical.
6865240	6872640	The problem is when people connect a factuality to their mood, when you say, regardless of
6872640	6879960	the cause of your bad mood, when you say that because of your bad mood, you need to do something
6879960	6885880	and we all know what the stuff you want to do when you're in a bad mood is or, but this
6885880	6890920	is something that we overlook a lot, when you think that because that you're in a bad
6890920	6895640	mood because of the shit that happened to you recently because of everything that your
6895640	6899520	life has been, those are big mistakes.
6899520	6907040	You're connecting shit that may be co-relative, but it's not cause effective.
6907040	6912720	And that's why, but if you can just go, I am in a bad mood, here's how I feel when I'm
6912720	6913720	in a bad mood.
6913720	6923280	I feel like this and you write it down or like just feel it so much that you create
6923280	6925280	any kind of snapshot with it.
6925280	6932880	I'm telling you that snapshot is as valuable to humanity as a photograph from an oceanographer
6932880	6938920	of the Marianas Trench, because you might be experiencing depths that are no deeper
6938920	6945600	than the person that never went deeper, but you're experiencing depths from an angle that
6945600	6947340	has never been seen.
6947340	6954040	And we need before we all die, when we will probably die by our own hand, so no matter
6954040	6958920	how depressed you get, why bother killing yourself when you know humanity will do that
6958920	6962600	for you?
6962600	6963720	Leave it to them.
6963720	6968720	It's like, well, the one area of human society that you can leave to the customer service
6968720	6971320	department, like you know, they'll get around to it.
6971320	6975560	You don't have to do it, but I'm not saying logic is a reason to not hurt yourself.
6975560	6980560	I'm just saying when you're at that point, when it feels like you have no course of action
6980560	6986880	other than something, I'm telling you fucking wait it out because you are a sensor that
6986880	6991800	has been shot from God, like to like look at that spot.
6991800	6997720	It's the spot that only you can see, it may seem unremarkable, no life grows there, it's
6997720	7004720	jagged and unfriendly and all it says to you is fuck you, you shouldn't be here.
7004720	7009800	Well that's the whole point of a probe, like you shouldn't be there and you won't be there
7009800	7015040	at some point, like you will get out of there, but and you will be stronger and the people
7015040	7019800	around you will be stronger because you got down there and you saw that shit and you live
7019800	7030440	down there Fred Stoller, you were a Marianas trench cruiser, church, to make it to like
7030440	7036080	I was out here like like every day you're just like cruising through the fucking depths,
7036080	7043840	the lowest places that the ocean can afford, that's valuable data to everybody, it's going
7043840	7048800	to end up making Jared Kushner live a more fruitful life, he's going to be on his elliptical
7048800	7052600	and he's going to be like, I learned from Fred that there's a new way to describe the
7052600	7064040	feeling you have when watermelon makes you feel bad, I kind of lost it at the end there.
7064040	7069240	I get things but I can't articulate it, that's why this guy's amazing, because I can articulate
7069240	7076560	nothing, I'm like a box and if a breeze blows through it, it sounds like something's being
7076560	7083160	said, so when you hold it up to anyone, but you have to hold it up at a distance, yeah,
7083160	7089240	all right, well we should end our show, I got real drunk during it because I love listening
7089240	7097280	to you and like so, what's the book, tell us the book again so we can get off this podcast
7097280	7098280	and go get it.
7098280	7105200	It's called Five Minutes to Kill, there's a subtitle they came up with, how the HBO Young
7105200	7111680	Comedian Special Changed the Lives of 1989's Six Funniest People, that's, they came up
7111680	7112680	at the same time.
7112680	7116920	Okay, well it sounds like, it's a dollar 99 but it's legit.
7116920	7125320	I can't wait to read the book by their marketing department called Refining the Key to Killing
7125320	7131800	Something because whatever it's called, whether it's grapes or celery, it should be short
7131800	7133600	and we should remember it.
7133600	7134600	Five Minutes to Kill.
7134600	7135600	Five Minutes to Kill.
7135600	7136600	Forget the other part.
7136600	7141520	Please tell your publisher to stop doing that.
7141520	7142520	Fred Stoller everybody.
7142520	7143520	Thank you so much.
7143520	7152000	Brandon Johnson was your comptroller, Ori, Ori's going to come back with his dad and we're
7152000	7157960	going to connect about this very common story about fathers and sons, you drift apart, then
7157960	7163960	you come back, I want to be there for the, and collect a loose change that hits the floor.
7163960	7166760	Steve Levy, you did so good in Spencer's job.
7166760	7168840	By not saying anything?
7168840	7169840	Yeah.
7169840	7170840	Alright.
7170840	7171840	That's great.
7171840	7175800	But you did, you scheduled something for tomorrow and I'm supposed to just write another show.
7175800	7176800	Yeah.
7176800	7177800	I'll just write another show tomorrow.
7177800	7178800	Yes.
7178800	7180280	While everyone else is memorializing things.
7180280	7186600	Yeah, but then you get to celebrate Memorial Day with a triple A celebrity tomorrow night.
7186600	7187600	Triple A?
7187600	7188600	Vin Diesel?
7188600	7193920	I'm having, I'm having Andy Kindler guilt for those comments.
7194920	7195920	Oh, come on.
7195920	7196920	I already met him.
7196920	7197920	Wow.
7197920	7198920	He doesn't even like me.
7198920	7199920	I don't know.
7199920	7200920	I don't know.
7200920	7201920	He clearly does.
7201920	7202920	He could be anybody.
7202920	7203920	Alright.
7203920	7212120	Cancel all of it, but no, don't, the, the guy, the A-list guy, he'll think it's a famous
7212120	7213120	prank.
7213120	7214120	Alright.
7214120	7216120	The, the, the, the, all right.
7216120	7217120	Rap.
7217120	7218120	Give me a rap beat.
7218120	7219120	I'm going to rap.
7219120	7227080	But then Fred, Fred, when I point at you, you have to like, don't, you have to say,
7227080	7229800	just say, say what you're saying.
7229800	7231840	Just be the, my Fred Stoller inner voice.
7231840	7233720	Be my Fred Stoller inner voice.
7233720	7234720	Do we have a track?
7234720	7240520	I can make one on GarageBand.
7240520	7241520	You're not ready yet, Liberace.
7241520	7242520	Oh shit.
7242520	7243520	Yeah.
7243520	7244520	Little volume, please.
7244520	7245520	Yeah.
7245520	7246520	Heard him dance.
7246520	7247520	Yeah.
7248520	7249520	Yeah.
7249520	7251520	Oh Lord.
7252520	7255520	Oh God above.
7255520	7258520	I pray for the strength.
7259520	7260520	Fuck.
7260520	7263520	I pray for cord length.
7263520	7264520	Yo.
7264520	7265520	Yo.
7265520	7266520	Yo.
7267520	7268520	Yo.
7268520	7270520	I pray for your strength.
7270520	7271520	I pray in church.
7271520	7273520	I pray for more cord length.
7273520	7276520	I want the insulation and the 60 cycle hum.
7276520	7283520	I want your mama and your daddy to say drum, drum, drum from the savage to the, to the
7283520	7284520	collaborative.
7284520	7290520	Our society's got nothing to give when it grows from one strong chimp to a bunch of
7290520	7296520	simple shit that goes beyond limping across the space to the moon and then you don't go
7296520	7297520	back.
7297520	7299520	Why, why don't we live in there?
7299520	7302520	Did we have an attack of neuroses?
7302520	7307520	Are we not going places that we need to be?
7307520	7309520	It's never dated by the crowd.
7309520	7313520	I thought they wanted to hear sci-fi animation stuff.
7314520	7316520	And they got who's this fucking older guy.
7316520	7320520	He's sort of familiar, but I think they like some of this stuff.
7320520	7322520	Maybe the writing, Seinfeld.
7322520	7323520	I don't know.
7323520	7324520	Yo.
7324520	7325520	Yo.
7325520	7326520	Give me the strength.
7327520	7330520	Give me some of that cord length.
7330520	7331520	Yo.
7332520	7336520	I went into a car and I drove to a tar pit.
7336520	7338520	I saw the dinosaur and more.
7338520	7344520	I went down into it and I said, I'm now extinct like you, but here's what I'm going to do.
7344520	7347520	I'm going to eat you up, but you're covered in tar.
7347520	7350520	So you taste worse than a candy bar.
7350520	7356520	But when you're in my stomach, I'll take you far into the reaches of the place where carbon-based
7356520	7358520	life couldn't reach.
7358520	7363520	I'm glad my relatives are older and don't listen to this podcast.
7363520	7370520	I'm nervous that they're going to hear about mushrooms and spending money at Malibu.
7370520	7373520	Freddie, you got the money?
7373520	7374520	Why'd you do that?
7374520	7376520	She took advantage.
7376520	7378520	They're strangers.
7378520	7382520	Stars, cosmic stars.
7382520	7385520	Stardust from Mars.
7385520	7387520	Goes down on your planet.
7387520	7393520	And you know, no matter how hard you plan it, you can't make a motherfucking thing happen
7393520	7394520	to you.
7394520	7397520	It wasn't going to happen to you.
7397520	7399520	I've had a dick and it was a flag.
7399520	7401520	I don't know what I'm saying.
7401520	7402520	I'm so drunk.
7402520	7404520	I can't lag from my rapping and my rhyming.
7404520	7406520	Won't fuck a mama tonight.
7406520	7409520	Mike equals voices in my mind tonight.
7409520	7411520	I got to stay on the floor.
7411520	7413520	I got to rap down and low.
7413520	7415520	I was thinking about it too hard.
7415520	7417520	Get out of my yard.
7417520	7419520	This isn't rap.
7419520	7421520	I'm rapping.
7421520	7424520	Confident now after doing tonight.
7424520	7428520	I'm going to go home without the GPS.
7428520	7433520	Make my way back to cancer and get some food.
7433520	7435520	That's how confident I am.
7435520	7440520	I'll find Kewenga somehow without the GPS.
7440520	7442520	I'll do it.
7442520	7445520	Maybe I got some tweets.
7445520	7448520	I haven't checked my thing in like two hours.
7448520	7450520	This is great.
7450520	7452520	As long as I'm gone.
7452520	7453520	All right.
7453520	7454520	Fred Stoller, everybody.
7454520	7455520	Thank you so much.
7455520	7456520	Thank you for coming back.
7456520	7457520	Brandon Johnson.
7457520	7458520	Zach McKeever.
7458520	7462520	Sarah Hill.
7462520	7463520	I'm too drunk.
7463520	7464520	Do you remember anybody that works on the show?
7464520	7466520	I think you nailed it.
7466520	7467520	Okay.
7467520	7468520	There's somebody back there.
7468520	7471520	Chris Peruff who does everything.
7471520	7472520	Oh, thank you so much.
7472520	7473520	Thank you.
7473520	7474520	Yeah.
7474520	7475520	Yeah.
7475520	7479520	Just pretend you kept clapping longer.
7479520	7483520	Make some noise tonight for a bank.
7483520	7486520	This has been Home and Town.
7486520	7489520	Drop fast.
7489520	7490520	Lift fast.
7490520	7492520	Drop faster.
7493520	7516520	Did you get any of that?
7516520	7518520	It's a good show.
