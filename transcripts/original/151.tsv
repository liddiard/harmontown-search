0	7560	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, in the Meltdown showroom, Harmon Town is now
7560	8560	in session.
8560	17560	I am your Comptroller Jeff Davis.
17560	25560	Please welcome your dungeon master, Spencer Crichton, to the stage.
26560	33560	And now please welcome the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
38560	44560	Thank you, Jeff Davis, everybody.
44560	51560	Oh, I was almost going to pull my phone out and put my drink down for a physical ritual
51560	58560	that has long oppressed me, but I'm free now.
58560	61560	Dan is presenting the audience his new Apple Watch?
61560	62560	What do they call it?
62560	63560	Apple Watch?
63560	64560	Yep.
64560	71560	I only need to free a hand to swipe.
71560	72560	Ever note?
72560	73560	Ever note?
73560	75560	There we go.
75560	81560	Let's talk about Jurassic World.
81560	84560	Or if you prefer, let's talk about the Apple Watch.
84560	87560	Oh, grandpa.
87560	90560	No one calls them I anymore.
90560	96560	Black people aren't I people.
96560	97560	They sure aren't, Dan.
97560	98560	They're just people.
98560	99560	They're not.
99560	101560	They're just Apple people.
101560	102560	Remember when...
102560	104560	We've talked about this 8,000 times.
104560	106560	My grandparents think that...
106560	110560	Your grandparents probably, too, think that black people are supposed to be called colored
110560	112560	people, that that is polite.
112560	114560	You all roll your eyes at that.
114560	116560	I roll my eyes at that.
116560	121560	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, however...
121560	123560	Bit of a pickle.
123560	127560	Stationary already ordered.
127560	130560	It's just one of those funny things that happens to a species.
130560	132560	Did you hear about that lady from...
132560	134560	Well, I almost didn't.
134560	135560	Everybody...
135560	136560	Yes.
136560	137560	Yes.
137560	144560	The leader of the Spokane, Washington chapter of the NAACP was outed by her parents as being
144560	147560	a tan white lady.
147560	148560	After, I don't know how many years.
148560	149560	How many years...
149560	151560	Do we know how many years she successfully...
151560	152560	10?
152560	155560	So there's always weird conversations that are happening, which are totally awesome and
155560	161560	healthy, especially in the midst of, for instance, you know, the transgender movement, which
162560	168560	has everything to do with what you are born as does not define you.
168560	169560	Absolutely not.
169560	175560	And then there's an equally, like, totally valid, like, clearly obvious observation that,
175560	180560	like, if you were born as a blonde, blue-eyed lady, you do not have the right to go to a
180560	182560	tanning booth, frizz your hair, and then become the...
182560	185560	Say that you're getting hate mail because you're so black.
185560	190560	Like, this is all good, in my opinion.
190560	191560	This is all fantastic.
191560	195560	I mean, I'm sure other people have the right to be offended or care way more than I do.
195560	198560	As far as I'm concerned, it seems like fun.
198560	199560	Oh, man.
199560	200560	Fucking...
200560	201560	Why not?
201560	203560	Everything's fun to us, yeah.
203560	204560	Yeah.
204560	205560	That's called privilege.
205560	208560	I think that's what they mean when they say, check your privilege.
208560	211560	As long as we don't, like, get involved, we're fine.
211560	212560	That's the new political correctness.
212560	214560	We just get to say, fuck it.
214560	217560	Like, that's us being the most open-minded we can be.
217560	218560	What are you doing?
218560	219560	Jane is here.
219560	220560	Earthshine Jane.
220560	221560	All right.
221560	222560	Oh, my God.
222560	223560	What's your last name?
223560	226560	Do you want your last name out there?
226560	227560	Just Jane.
227560	228560	Just Jane.
228560	231560	Earthshine Jane is your Twitter handle, correct?
231560	232560	Yep.
232560	238560	Aside from the fact that Jane has been the purveyor and distributor for us of fine, absent
238560	241560	and awesome booze, did you make this glass bottle, too?
241560	242560	I did not.
242560	244560	I have a friend who's a master glass blower now.
244560	245560	Yeah?
245560	246560	I designed it, but he made it.
246560	247560	This is really good.
247560	248560	This is fantastic.
248560	249560	And so I have a bottle of...
249560	254560	Sadly, I have the dregs of a bottle of...
254560	256560	The rest of it's in the decanter.
256560	257560	Oh, it's in here.
257560	258560	You've broken it in half.
258560	259560	I love it.
259560	260560	Jane...
260560	262560	Can I do a commercial for Jane's absence?
262560	266560	I took this absence of malice to a party, and I actually had about that much.
266560	268560	I had about, like, maybe a little bit more than that.
268560	272560	Brought it to a party where I was dressed as David Bowie, because it was a glam party.
272560	273560	And you had a David Bowie concert.
273560	275560	I just had one laying around.
275560	280560	And I took this to the party, and everybody there wanted to know how to get more of it.
280560	281560	This stuff is really groovy.
281560	283560	And it gets you high.
283560	285560	Well, why don't we find out how...
285560	288560	Jane, do you want to come up and talk or no?
288560	289560	It's cool.
289560	290560	No.
290560	291560	Okay, okay.
291560	293560	There was a hesitation there.
293560	294560	Oh, okay.
294560	295560	All right.
295560	296560	No.
296560	297560	Okay, cool.
297560	298560	Yeah.
298560	299560	Oh, great.
299560	300560	We'll talk later on.
300560	301560	That's great.
301560	302560	That's the first time I might get in trouble.
302560	303560	Are we getting in trouble?
303560	305560	Like, don't come up if you don't want to come up actually finally, like...
305560	306560	Well...
306560	308560	Because I'm always saying it as the...
308560	310560	By the way, if you don't want to be exploited...
310560	311560	Yeah, yeah.
311560	315560	Well, there might be some sort of agencies that might care about that.
315560	316560	No, there's all kinds of shit that...
316560	318560	Well, it was just ironically why...
318560	321560	Which is why there's a story to tell and why I want to talk to you eventually.
321560	324560	But like I said, like, tweet me when the adventure is over.
324560	327560	Also, while we're thanking people for gifts, this was sent to me...
327560	329560	Apparently, it's been here for a month or two.
329560	332560	Tweet me when the adventure's over.
332560	336560	That's the title of my book.
336560	338560	That's my wake me for the weekend.
338560	340560	I got this little gift backstage, Dan.
340560	344560	It's from a person by the hilarious name of Susan Shipper.
344560	347560	And I was shipped to my first class U.S. postal.
347560	349560	And I opened it up, and it's a Scottish ski and dew,
349560	351560	which is what you put in your sock if you want a kilt.
351560	354560	Did you mention it was through a rat?
354560	355560	I did not mention it.
355560	357560	As it came out of the envelope.
357560	358560	It's a different message.
358560	359560	It's actually like, it's a weapon.
359560	361560	It's a knife that you keep in your sock if you're wearing a kilt.
361560	363560	But then I was like, why would somebody give me that?
363560	364560	And I looked at it.
364560	365560	There's a little emerald on the side here.
365560	366560	It's an emerald dagger.
366560	367560	Emerald dagger.
367560	372560	I love it.
372560	373560	Do you think that's from...
373560	374560	Is that from a Scottish fan?
374560	375560	Is the address in Scotland?
375560	378560	Susan Shipper doesn't sound terribly Scottish, but I love it.
378560	379560	Is there a return address?
379560	382560	Don't say it out loud, but...
382560	386560	Well, the wholesale cutlery store in Arlington, Texas.
386560	387560	All right.
387560	389560	This watch is one of the shortcomings.
389560	391560	It has to do with the settings I programmed into it.
391560	398560	It vibrates my wrist every time someone tweets at me.
398560	400560	Every time somebody you know tweets you,
400560	401560	or any time anybody tweets you.
401560	402560	Yeah.
402560	404560	Well, you set it up however you want.
404560	408560	I made a mistake.
408560	411560	I also immediately got all these games on my watch.
411560	413560	So at any given moment, it'll buzz, and I'll go like,
413560	415560	oh, that could be someone needs a kidney.
415560	416560	No.
416560	420560	Spy Master needs to know if he should face down these dogs.
420560	421560	Yes or no.
421560	422560	Do it.
422560	426560	There's like these games for the watch that are so dumb
426560	429560	that they're basically just like some guy,
429560	431560	like a fictional guy,
431560	433560	buzzes your watch every six hours
433560	435560	to let you know he needs more training.
435560	437560	Can you Minecraft?
437560	438560	No, you can't Minecraft.
438560	443560	Everyone stop making fun of me, which brings me to a new thing.
443560	446560	I don't even mean that because I don't take it personally
446560	453560	because that's one of the four agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz,
453560	455560	which my wife Erin McGathey turned me on to.
455560	457560	The four agreements, Jeff.
457560	461560	The audio book takes less time to listen to than this podcast,
461560	463560	which I have not done yet.
463560	466560	But I got into the first agreement.
466560	474560	But the four agreements are, goddamn this fucking watch.
474560	475560	Spencer, are you getting a watch?
475560	476560	Oh, no.
476560	477560	Now there's another fucking tweet.
477560	480560	Now people, of course, are tweeting me.
480560	482560	You guys are great.
482560	485560	It's like The Simpsons where they're all shocking each other.
485560	486560	I get it.
486560	489560	You're amazing.
489560	490560	That's hilarious.
490560	491560	It doesn't...
491560	493560	I'm not going to judge you for it.
493560	495560	I'm just going to say it doesn't take talent.
496560	498560	To do what you're doing.
498560	502560	It's just the digital equivalent of throwing a tomato.
502560	504560	That's all it is.
504560	506560	It doesn't take any talent.
506560	508560	You're creating a culture of fear,
508560	510560	which is what I've learned from this book.
510560	516560	Anyway, so the first agreement is don't train raptors.
516560	519560	No, I'm getting my notes mixed up.
519560	522560	The first of the four agreements is...
522560	525560	This is The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz.
525560	526560	So look it up.
526560	529560	The audiobook is $10, which is what you paid to get in here.
529560	532560	It is two hours long, so if you listen...
532560	533560	What are the agreements?
533560	535560	The agreements are...
535560	538560	Well, first can I explain what he means by agreement?
538560	539560	Yes, please do.
539560	542560	Okay, so he starts with the cosmology.
542560	545560	Everything that we're experiencing right now is a dream.
545560	547560	That's not new.
547560	550560	There's a famous song about rowing boats.
550560	555560	And I'm not kidding.
555560	556560	I was thinking about that on the way here.
556560	560560	I'm like, goddamn, they hide the secret in fucking plain sight.
560560	562560	It's on the back of a cereal box.
562560	565560	Life is but a fucking dream, motherfucker.
565560	568560	And then we watch The Matrix and we're like, holy shit.
568560	570560	Yeah, row, row your boat.
570560	573560	I wanted to say the N-word so bad.
573560	577560	Row, row your boat.
578560	581560	We are all dreaming right now.
581560	583560	We're all dreaming.
583560	588560	If life were but a dream, why not say the N-word after that?
588560	591560	Because I don't want to pollute that dream for other people,
591560	593560	because we're in a shared dream also.
593560	595560	Is that one of the agreements?
595560	598560	Don't drop an N-bomb in someone else's dream.
598560	601560	No, the first agreement is be impeccable with your word.
601560	604560	And so we'll get to that.
604560	605560	I need some work on that one.
605560	607560	I'll probably die getting that one right.
607560	613560	But the idea, the cosmology is we are all made of light,
613560	616560	the light between stars.
616560	619560	Easy to laugh at, young man.
621560	623560	He's not laughing at that concept.
623560	626560	He's laughing at you fishing your way through this.
626560	628560	You don't know him.
628560	632560	Trevor, he's laughing at the wrong shit.
632560	634560	I've met him.
635560	639560	He's three minutes from his next DUI.
639560	644560	But his dad's a senator, and I'm not bringing him up.
647560	649560	We're all light.
649560	651560	What is that?
651560	652560	What's the implication of that?
652560	655560	Why is that important?
655560	658560	No, it's just a model of...
658560	660560	Of light.
662560	663560	What do you mean, why is that important?
663560	668560	Well, is that a necessary principle for the rest of the agreements?
668560	669560	I think so.
669560	670560	Oh, okay, sorry.
670560	673560	But you could probably do away with it after...
673560	675560	I think, because it never really comes back to...
675560	677560	By the way, don't forget we're all light.
677560	678560	That's what I'm asking.
678560	681560	I'm just taking you through the guy's whole cosmology.
681560	683560	Thank you.
685560	687560	Do you guys like the format where we bring Spencer up before me?
687560	689560	I thought that was a good choice.
689560	691560	Thank you, thank you.
692560	694560	Why are we saving him for dessert?
694560	696560	I couldn't be more nervous.
696560	697560	Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
697560	698560	It really puts a lot more responsibility.
698560	699560	We have no idea.
699560	705560	If Spencer is like the dessert cart laying off the side of the table while you're eating dinner,
705560	707560	you're eyeing that cake the whole time.
707560	710560	You get to look at that delicious cake over there.
710560	714560	Spencer, you're like a sexy cannoli sitting over there, just whoop-whoop.
714560	717560	That sounds good.
717560	719560	There are some people who are here for the first time,
719560	722560	and they're wondering, why am I watching this?
722560	723560	I'll tell you.
723560	724560	It's for my book reviews.
724560	727560	What are the goddamn agreements?
727560	730560	The cosmology is we're made of light,
734560	735560	and life is a dream.
735560	737560	We're all dreaming right now.
737560	740560	You dream when you go to sleep, and yeah, your dog also dreams,
740560	744560	and he's like...
744560	748560	We're dreaming when we're awake, too, because this is all an illusion.
748560	751560	The difference between this dream and the one you have when you're asleep
751560	753560	is simply the fact that this one's consistent,
753560	757560	which makes you think it's more real, because it will be here tomorrow,
757560	760560	but it also means it was here before you were born.
760560	766560	It's as artificial a reality as the ones that you have when you go to sleep at night.
766560	768560	Life is a dream.
768560	771560	We all share it, and that doesn't mean bad.
771560	773560	It doesn't mean less real than important.
774560	778560	Just to put yourself in that space where you think of reality,
778560	781560	everything that we're living right now as a dream,
781560	783560	it kind of immediately sort of relaxes you,
783560	786560	and all the great myths that we've ever heard drive into that.
786560	791560	All of those sacred texts insinuate that, including The Matrix.
791560	794560	And Inception.
797560	800560	You love it. You love it.
800560	802560	You do. This guy loves Inception.
802560	806560	Wait. Oh, my God. The writer of Inception is here.
806560	809560	I glanced at you, and I was like, Holy shit. I bet you wrote Inception.
809560	812560	Will you stand up and prove...
812560	815560	Doesn't he look like you wrote Inception?
816560	818560	He wrote Inception.
818560	821560	Possibly. Or is it a dream?
821560	824560	I think he also wrote for whom the bell tolls.
825560	829560	I think that was a joke about the power you emanate.
830560	833560	It's all a dream.
833560	835560	We are indoctrinated in the dream by way of agreement.
835560	837560	So from the moment you're born, you're making agreements.
837560	839560	Your attention's getting hooked by your parents.
839560	841560	For good reason, they're telling you, this is how you live in this dream.
841560	843560	This is what the alphabet is.
843560	845560	You call that a door. You call that a doormat.
845560	847560	You call that an elephant. You call that an apple.
847560	850560	You have to...
850560	856560	The idea is that human beings are capable of experiencing a thousand things at once
856560	859560	and of living as if we are living in a dream,
859560	863560	of constant contradiction and never being certain about anything.
863560	866560	Our brains are designed for that chaos, but we won.
866560	870560	We took over the Earth, and we have created a dream of very, very focused,
870560	872560	very artificial things.
872560	877560	And the only problem with it is that reality is...
877560	880560	It's obscured by the smoke that we create between all of us.
880560	882560	We're never actually...
883560	886560	Granted, I listened to this for a half hour, and I turned it off.
886560	890560	But we're made of light.
890560	895560	All matter is mirrors. It's reflecting the light.
895560	898560	So every time you're looking at anything with your eyes,
898560	901560	you're actually seeing something that's simply reflective of something else.
901560	907560	You're not actually experiencing anything by looking at something.
907560	911560	So we are all reflecting each other, and we are all...
911560	916560	The truth is right in front of us, but we have all been indoctrinated into a dream
916560	919560	through these agreements that we make with society
919560	923560	that teach you to sort of basically operate on fear.
923560	926560	You're a good boy if you do this. You're a bad boy if you do that.
926560	929560	You're a really bad boy if you think that you're a girl.
929560	932560	Ooh!
932560	935560	There's all these rules.
935560	938560	You guys know I was being ironic when I said that.
938560	941560	It's a fucking generation.
944560	947560	This is the flawed society I'm representing.
947560	950560	God damn it, I hate these fucking kids.
950560	952560	They trick you into explaining everything.
952560	954560	Dan, they're just light. They're just light.
954560	957560	You're light. You're light.
957560	959560	You're light.
959560	962560	It's all a dream. We're gonna wake up when we die.
962560	965560	It has nothing to do with afterlife or anything.
965560	967560	It's just to say...
967560	970560	And also these illusions about an afterlife.
970560	974560	The hell that we describe in Christian mythology...
974560	978560	Isn't it now? This is what the author says.
978560	982560	This world of fear and hate and where anybody can do anything,
982560	985560	where your neighbor might break in your door and eat you,
985560	989560	or he might reward you if you're a good enough boy or a bad enough boy.
989560	993560	It's all driven by fear and prejudice and judgment
993560	997560	and constant pursuit of pleasing other people
997560	999560	and hooking other people's attention
999560	1001560	and having your attention be hooked by them
1001560	1005560	when really what we are designed to do is just float and do all this stuff.
1005560	1008560	So the idea of the four agreements is to
1008560	1011560	wipe away all the agreements that you have made to get this far.
1011560	1014560	Wipe them all away and replace them with these four primary agreements.
1014560	1016560	Number one.
1016560	1022560	Always...
1022560	1025560	If you are... Number one.
1025560	1029560	The first three are traffic-oriented.
1029560	1032560	Number one. If you're parking uphill,
1032560	1036560	always turn your wheels to face the curb.
1036560	1040560	Dan, does one of these agreements have something to do with little shits?
1040560	1042560	Whether or not to sweat it.
1042560	1044560	The first rule is, yeah, don't sweat the little shit.
1044560	1047560	The second agreement is, it's all little shit.
1047560	1049560	The first agreement is...
1049560	1051560	Don't talk about the four agreements.
1058560	1062560	I hope that's not in there.
1062560	1065560	Alright, let me just scroll through my watch,
1065560	1067560	which I'm very happy I bought.
1067560	1070560	Be impeccable with your word.
1070560	1072560	I like that one.
1072560	1074560	Fuck you.
1074560	1076560	Dan, that's not very impeccable.
1076560	1078560	What does that mean to be impeccable with your word?
1078560	1080560	Do you want me to read the copy?
1080560	1082560	It's short.
1082560	1086560	These glasses, by the way, only work for far away.
1086560	1089560	My life is a dream.
1089560	1091560	It's insane.
1091560	1095560	It's an insane dream where I'm now wearing props to make people like me.
1095560	1097560	I have 20-20 vision.
1097560	1103560	I was wearing these because people like me more in them.
1103560	1105560	Now we don't.
1105560	1108560	I fell into it.
1108560	1110560	Now that we know it's all lies.
1110560	1113560	Be impeccable with your word.
1113560	1115560	Rule number one.
1115560	1117560	Say only what you mean.
1117560	1119560	Avoid using the word to speak against yourself
1119560	1124560	or to gossip about others, Jeff.
1124560	1127560	Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love,
1127560	1131560	Adam Goldberg.
1131560	1134560	You're doing the opposite of being impeccable every time you inject...
1134560	1136560	Rule number two.
1136560	1141560	Don't call out people who are telling you you're not allowed to.
1141560	1144560	There's five agreements.
1144560	1147560	One A. You can't. You're not allowed.
1147560	1149560	If someone knows the four agreements before you do,
1149560	1152560	they get to tell you what they are.
1152560	1154560	So rule number one. Don't talk shit.
1154560	1158560	Yeah, don't talk shit. That's tough. That's hard.
1158560	1160560	Rule number two. Don't take anything personally.
1160560	1162560	This is the one that led me to this
1162560	1165560	because I think this is the big thing that I have in my life.
1165560	1168560	All of my conflict is based on either
1168560	1171560	I am taking something personally that people didn't mean to be taken personally
1171560	1174560	or I am saying something that someone else is taking personally
1174560	1177560	that I did not mean for them to take personally.
1177560	1180560	Nothing others do is because of you.
1180560	1183560	What others say and do is a projection of their own reality,
1183560	1185560	their own dream.
1185560	1187560	When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others,
1187560	1189560	you won't be the victim of needless suffering.
1189560	1191560	It's easier said than done.
1191560	1194560	I've heard that. Don't take it personally.
1194560	1196560	I find myself, I'm like, shit, God damn it.
1196560	1198560	I keep catching myself.
1198560	1201560	If I could rephrase that, don't sweat the little shit.
1201560	1204560	God, you're a fucking idiot.
1204560	1206560	Rule number one.
1206560	1208560	That's a reflection of me.
1208560	1210560	You broke rule number two and number one.
1210560	1212560	You don't know that. I'm a dream.
1212560	1214560	I'm a dream, you piece of shit.
1214560	1216560	I'm a dream.
1216560	1218560	You know nothing in my dream.
1218560	1221560	Everything you're saying is smoke.
1221560	1225560	We're doing great. This book is saving our lives.
1225560	1227560	Rule number three.
1227560	1229560	Don't make assumptions.
1229560	1231560	Find the courage. Don't make assumptions.
1231560	1233560	Pause.
1233560	1235560	Find the courage to ask questions.
1235560	1238560	I really like this one because I think this one actually,
1238560	1241560	it braids nicely. This book is very old.
1241560	1244560	My wife found this book in high school
1244560	1247560	in her identity-seeking phase.
1247560	1252560	But this rule, I think, really is important
1252560	1256560	as we enter this sort of culture of awareness
1256560	1259560	and progression and calling each other out
1259560	1262560	for things that we're doing wrong and stuff.
1262560	1265560	Because I've said a couple times on this podcast,
1265560	1268560	boy, could we try to understand ignorance
1268560	1270560	a little more than we are?
1270560	1274560	So agreement number three is don't make assumptions.
1274560	1277560	Find the courage to ask questions
1277560	1279560	and to express what you really want.
1279560	1283560	Communicate with others as clearly as you can
1283560	1287560	to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.
1287560	1289560	With just this one agreement, you can completely
1289560	1291560	transform your life. I don't know why he says that.
1291560	1293560	Because it's true, man.
1293560	1295560	Kind of shitting on the other agreements.
1295560	1298560	Dan, you're making an assumption there.
1298560	1300560	You're right.
1300560	1302560	But I'm asking you a question. Why would you say that?
1302560	1304560	Get your agreements shit together.
1304560	1307560	Anyways, on that note, the fourth agreement,
1307560	1308560	here's what's funny about this.
1308560	1310560	I'm going to try to encapsulate this.
1310560	1312560	Don't fill up on bread.
1312560	1314560	We started to...
1319560	1320560	Because right there.
1320560	1324560	Agreement number four, don't fill up on bread.
1324560	1327560	You're always going to want to fill up on bread.
1327560	1328560	It's delicious.
1328560	1330560	It's particularly hot and buttery in restaurants.
1330560	1332560	But so is the food that's coming.
1332560	1334560	They're going to charge you for your meal anyway.
1334560	1337560	Don't fill up on bread.
1337560	1340560	That was a weird one to throw there.
1340560	1343560	But the reason this whole thing came up
1343560	1346560	is because we were in Austin with Derek Waters,
1346560	1348560	the creator of Drunk History,
1348560	1351560	and Erin and I were sitting at a table drinking in this bar.
1351560	1353560	And then the four agreements came up
1353560	1356560	because Erin had encountered this book in her life.
1356560	1358560	And she remembered don't take it personally
1358560	1359560	as the important one,
1359560	1362560	the one that I think performers are constantly dealing with.
1362560	1364560	You make a show and somebody says,
1364560	1366560	this episode wasn't as good as this episode.
1366560	1368560	And what a writer hears is,
1368560	1370560	you're a failure and fuck you.
1370560	1372560	And then you write an email and say,
1372560	1373560	do your time magazine, fuck off.
1373560	1375560	I never did it.
1375560	1377560	But it's like you're taking it personally.
1377560	1380560	Anyways, so what are the other three agreements?
1380560	1381560	And we're like, oh, wow.
1381560	1382560	Be impeccable with your word.
1382560	1383560	That's crazy.
1383560	1384560	Oh, man.
1384560	1385560	Yeah.
1385560	1386560	Don't make assumptions.
1386560	1387560	That's really good.
1387560	1388560	And then, oh, shit.
1388560	1389560	Okay.
1389560	1390560	I've got a text real quick there.
1390560	1391560	Okay.
1391560	1392560	But then the fourth one,
1392560	1394560	it's just funny because it's three performers,
1394560	1396560	like creative people sitting at a table.
1396560	1397560	And we all looked at the fourth one
1397560	1398560	when we found out what it was
1398560	1400560	because we couldn't remember it.
1400560	1402560	And then when we saw what it was,
1402560	1405560	it's always do your best.
1406560	1408560	And all the people at the table went,
1408560	1409560	yeah, well, fuck that.
1409560	1413560	And then we all went, wait,
1413560	1414560	why would we feel that way?
1414560	1417560	It's because I think people who act direct,
1417560	1419560	stunt coordinate, make chairs,
1419560	1420560	I don't know.
1420560	1422560	I think there's a,
1422560	1423560	I don't know where you'd draw the line
1423560	1425560	because I don't want to make assumptions.
1425560	1427560	And I want to be impeccable with my word
1427560	1429560	and whatever the first one was.
1429560	1433560	But I do think actually somebody out there
1433560	1434560	needs to hear always do your best.
1434560	1436560	But I think the people that, you know,
1436560	1438560	a lot of the people probably in this room
1438560	1440560	and people in the city of Los Angeles,
1440560	1441560	when they hear that, they're just kind of like,
1441560	1444560	what the fuck do you think I'm doing?
1444560	1447560	You dumb piece of shit.
1447560	1450560	More like three agreements, all right?
1450560	1451560	But then we thought about it.
1451560	1452560	We're like, you know what?
1452560	1453560	I think a lot of people out there actually,
1453560	1455560	like someone that worked at Enron,
1455560	1457560	maybe if they had read that,
1457560	1458560	always do your best.
1458560	1460560	And they're like, yeah, I'm doing my best.
1460560	1461560	Yeah, but really your best?
1461560	1464560	Yeah, but that just doesn't include like your work
1464560	1467560	or your creativity that includes, you know, your...
1467560	1468560	Well, let's see what he meant.
1468560	1469560	Because I never bothered to read it
1469560	1470560	because I'm like, fuck that rule.
1470560	1472560	I'm assuming it means the way you behave to other people.
1472560	1473560	Always do your best.
1473560	1475560	Your best is going to...
1475560	1476560	Yeah, okay.
1476560	1477560	Okay.
1477560	1478560	Okay.
1478560	1481560	I got it, guys.
1481560	1482560	I got your tweets.
1482560	1483560	I get it.
1483560	1486560	Season four was great now.
1486560	1487560	It's all hilarious.
1487560	1490560	It's all coming to my watch.
1490560	1493560	You've all got my watch.
1493560	1497560	You all live on my wrist.
1497560	1499560	Now we lost, Jeff.
1499560	1500560	Always do your best.
1500560	1502560	Your best is going to change from moment to moment.
1502560	1505560	It will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.
1505560	1507560	That's it?
1507560	1510560	Okay, see, dumb agreement.
1510560	1512560	Just do your best, whatever.
1512560	1513560	I always do.
1513560	1514560	I try.
1514560	1515560	It always sucks.
1515560	1517560	But that's judgment on me.
1517560	1518560	You're not supposed to hate yourself too.
1518560	1519560	There's somewhere in there.
1520560	1521560	I've talked enough.
1521560	1524560	Let's start meeting some friends, because we've got a lot of them here tonight.
1524560	1529560	I really want to bring up the stranger that came into Season 6 of Community and nailed it.
1534560	1536560	Ms. Padgett Brewster!
1549560	1558560	You mean long?
1558560	1559560	No, I read that.
1559560	1560560	I read that.
1560560	1562560	The only two things I remember...
1562560	1563560	Hello, boss.
1563560	1564560	Hi.
1564560	1569560	The only two things I remember were, don't gossip, impossible.
1569560	1570560	Yeah, impossible.
1570560	1572560	But don't take anything personally.
1572560	1573560	Yeah.
1573560	1574560	That's the big one.
1574560	1582560	Because if someone is angry with you for whatever you did, it's more about them than you.
1582560	1584560	Most people are insecure.
1584560	1585560	I am.
1585560	1586560	You are.
1586560	1587560	We all are.
1587560	1590560	So whenever anyone says, what, who's not insecure?
1590560	1592560	Who just went, uh?
1592560	1595560	You lying sack of crap.
1595560	1596560	Who said you?
1596560	1597560	No, not you.
1597560	1598560	Enty's never insecure.
1598560	1600560	His dad's like an ambassador.
1601560	1603560	There's any time someone says...
1603560	1604560	Fuck you, Enty.
1604560	1605560	Don't take it personal.
1605560	1606560	Fuck you.
1607560	1608560	But it's true, though.
1608560	1611560	Don't take anything personally because whatever...
1611560	1614560	Any time anyone's talking, they're...
1614560	1615560	About them.
1615560	1616560	Yeah.
1616560	1617560	Always.
1617560	1618560	We don't have to worry about anything.
1618560	1619560	Yeah.
1619560	1621560	Everyone's worried about their own screw-ups.
1621560	1622560	Yeah.
1622560	1624560	I mean, we've heard it over and over and over and over again.
1624560	1627560	In fact, Spencer actually says that at the end of the dumb movie we were in.
1627560	1628560	It's not a dumb movie.
1628560	1629560	You learn it in retail.
1630560	1632560	I had to say dumb movie.
1632560	1633560	You learn it in retail.
1633560	1634560	Yeah, you do.
1634560	1636560	Well, you do or you get bitter.
1639560	1641560	He's so low to the ground.
1641560	1642560	Oh, yeah.
1642560	1645560	Well, you guys have a whole stage.
1645560	1646560	I'm not complaining.
1646560	1647560	I love it here.
1647560	1649560	It's the best table.
1649560	1653560	But yeah, I know you're literally elevated off the floor that I am on.
1655560	1656560	It's true.
1656560	1657560	It's true.
1657560	1660560	He enjoys too much power, as it is.
1660560	1661560	Best.
1661560	1663560	If I could dig a hole.
1663560	1664560	No.
1664560	1665560	Yeah.
1665560	1666560	I would put him in it.
1666560	1668560	I would have his head, like, on the floor.
1668560	1669560	No.
1669560	1670560	No, because he's...
1670560	1671560	I'm always called when I see Spencer.
1671560	1673560	He's a powerful person and he needs to be mitigated.
1673560	1674560	Aw, that's really sweet.
1674560	1675560	I love Spencer.
1675560	1676560	I'm going to remember that.
1676560	1677560	He makes me feel safe.
1677560	1680560	Spencer, do you feel powerful?
1680560	1681560	No.
1681560	1682560	Not at all.
1682560	1683560	You don't feel like you...
1683560	1684560	I feel like I have agency.
1684560	1688560	Like, I can, you know, like, lift a rock and, like, go to the beach and stuff.
1688560	1689560	You know?
1689560	1690560	Here's...
1690560	1693560	I just want to point out, here's some other people that said that.
1693560	1694560	What?
1694560	1696560	God and Hitler.
1696560	1699560	Hey, draw your own conclusions.
1699560	1702560	And don't take it personally.
1702560	1704560	But, I mean, those are...
1704560	1705560	Yeah.
1705560	1706560	God doesn't feel powerful.
1706560	1709560	Why would he make a universe if he felt powerful?
1709560	1710560	Hitler didn't feel powerful.
1710560	1713560	He would have stayed in art school.
1713560	1714560	This is no...
1714560	1718560	Don't let humility fool you.
1718560	1719560	It's the proboscis.
1719560	1724560	Do you think God and Hitler had humility?
1724560	1727560	They had self-loathing.
1727560	1730560	God was not content to be nothing.
1730560	1732560	He became everything.
1732560	1733560	Who does that?
1733560	1736560	Wait.
1736560	1737560	Who behaves that way?
1737560	1741560	A very, very confident person.
1741560	1742560	Did God...
1742560	1743560	No, I would not say that at all.
1743560	1749560	...grow up with a single mother in the projects, and he decided to be everything?
1749560	1751560	Wait, what...
1751560	1753560	No, I'm curious, maybe.
1753560	1755560	I was not raised with religion.
1755560	1757560	Well, I know...
1757560	1763560	Well, I was raised Lutheran, but I'm making up my own perception of God.
1763560	1765560	What is Lutheran?
1765560	1769560	You're saying that...
1770560	1772560	No, I'm not trying to be rude.
1772560	1773560	That's what the Pope said.
1773560	1775560	I was raised Lutheran, too.
1775560	1778560	Lutheran, they refer to it as Catholic light.
1778560	1779560	Like, it looks like Catholic.
1779560	1782560	You've got stained glass windows, and there's dudes wearing robes and shit.
1782560	1789560	You know how Catholicism is sit, stand, kneel, stand, kneel, stand, sit, kneel, genuflect, stand, kneel, pray, leave?
1789560	1793560	Lutheran is sit, leave.
1793560	1796560	It's the original Protestantism.
1796560	1797560	Oh.
1797560	1799560	It's Martin Luther.
1799560	1805560	Martin Luther was the first guy to say, look, religion should be accessible to the people.
1805560	1807560	So just sit and leave.
1807560	1808560	Well, I mean, I...
1808560	1811560	No, no, you do a little call and response and stuff like that.
1811560	1814560	He said, for instance, Bibles should not have to be in Latin.
1814560	1815560	Why aren't they in the secular language?
1815560	1816560	Oh, well, that's fair.
1816560	1817560	I mean, no one...
1817560	1818560	It's a dead language.
1818560	1821560	There's people who would argue with you, but, yeah, I wouldn't be one of them.
1821560	1823560	Because Latin is not Aramaic.
1823560	1825560	It's not like it's the language God was talking in in the first place.
1826560	1827560	No one knows Aramaic either.
1827560	1828560	Right.
1828560	1829560	I mean, Bibles should be...
1829560	1831560	If God's talking...
1831560	1832560	Dan, don't come knocking.
1836560	1840560	Which I believe was Deuteronomy 2.11.
1841560	1848560	You're saying, Dan, that if you believe in a creationist mythology that God created the universe from nothing and created everything,
1848560	1852560	you think that's an act of self-loathing and low self-esteem on his part?
1852560	1856560	You did say Hitler and God had low self-esteem.
1856560	1857560	If you don't...
1857560	1859560	They have something in common, which is a...
1859560	1863560	Hitler and God have something in common.
1863560	1864560	If you can't...
1864560	1865560	Deadline.com.
1865560	1867560	Yeah, well, that's...
1867560	1869560	Dan Harmon says...
1869560	1870560	God is Hitler.
1870560	1871560	Well, but think about it.
1871560	1876560	I mean, Jesus got crucified for saying the simple fact of, like, people would go,
1876560	1877560	oh, are you God?
1877560	1879560	And he would go like, well, technically, yeah.
1879560	1880560	And they'd be like, that's enough.
1880560	1881560	String them up.
1881560	1882560	He's like, no, we all are.
1882560	1883560	It's fine.
1883560	1888560	But, like, he's just being technical and philosophical and inviting you to think outside the box.
1888560	1889560	I mean, like, yeah, it's not...
1889560	1890560	It's not gonna...
1890560	1897560	It's not gonna get you late at a Halloween party to come into a, you know, in a costume that's like Hitler but with a halo.
1899560	1900560	And you're like, what's your point?
1900560	1901560	Because Hitler was God.
1901560	1903560	No, that's not a good message to send.
1903560	1906560	He made a lot of mistakes as a human being.
1906560	1908560	I'm saying that the God...
1908560	1909560	Hitler or God?
1909560	1910560	Wait, God or Hitler?
1910560	1911560	I feel like...
1911560	1912560	You're the one that's...
1912560	1914560	You're the one that's digging in this...
1914560	1915560	No, I'm asking you.
1915560	1916560	I'm telling you...
1916560	1918560	You're equating God with Hitler.
1918560	1921560	I'm telling you the one thing they had in common, maybe they both liked fried eggs,
1921560	1927560	but the one thing that I know that they had in common is that they weren't happy with their beginning state.
1927560	1928560	God wasn't happy...
1928560	1930560	You're saying that's the creationism...
1930560	1932560	My God, the God that I believe in...
1932560	1935560	The birth of all existence, all this light that we are and the mirrors that we all...
1935560	1936560	My...
1936560	1937560	That's the Four Agreements thing.
1937560	1939560	The whole thing that we are light is...
1939560	1940560	That's garbage.
1940560	1941560	How can the...
1943560	1944560	You have to get to the...
1944560	1946560	Just get to the second agreement.
1946560	1947560	The second agreement.
1947560	1948560	Just get to the second...
1948560	1949560	No, wait, that's not the first agreement.
1949560	1950560	Isn't that we're all light?
1950560	1951560	We're all light.
1951560	1952560	No, no, you don't have to agree with that.
1952560	1953560	Jesus.
1953560	1954560	You don't have to agree with that.
1954560	1955560	The Four Agreements are all...
1955560	1956560	The first agreement is your...
1956560	1957560	The first one's stupid.
1957560	1958560	We're all light.
1958560	1959560	No, no, there wasn't the first one.
1959560	1960560	It's a dream.
1960560	1961560	That wasn't the first one.
1961560	1962560	Fuck you.
1962560	1963560	No, don't gossip.
1963560	1964560	Nothing's personal.
1964560	1965560	That's the first one.
1965560	1966560	Don't gossip.
1966560	1967560	That's a dream.
1967560	1968560	Like, how can...
1968560	1969560	Yeah, whatever.
1969560	1970560	Yeah, right?
1970560	1971560	How can light dream?
1971560	1972560	You're living in a dream.
1972560	1973560	No one is light and a dream.
1973560	1976560	We're all dirt and we're human and we're sexual and we're assholes.
1976560	1977560	That's matter.
1977560	1978560	That's matter.
1978560	1979560	Matter's a reflection.
1979560	1980560	Sorry.
1980560	1981560	I interrupted.
1981560	1982560	No, that's good.
1982560	1983560	You're being...
1983560	1984560	I'm sorry.
1984560	1986560	You were talking about God and Hitler being the same.
1986560	1987560	And not by choice.
1987560	1988560	Carry on.
1988560	1989560	Patrick.
1989560	1990560	Patrick is being sexy dirt.
1990560	1992560	You're being impeccable with your word and saying like...
1992560	1993560	I've always been sexy dirt.
1993560	1994560	I mean, you know me.
1994560	1995560	What?
1996560	1997560	Sorry.
1997560	1999560	Get a different room.
1999560	2000560	Stop it.
2000560	2002560	Get a podcast.
2002560	2006560	You're being impeccable with your word when you say, yeah, we're all animals, we're all...
2006560	2007560	I think so.
2007560	2008560	Yeah.
2008560	2009560	So that's good.
2009560	2010560	So you're...
2010560	2011560	Yeah.
2011560	2012560	He's not...
2012560	2013560	This guy never said it.
2013560	2014560	I just want to make it clear because I feel like I'm doing a bad commercial for him.
2014560	2017560	He didn't say the first agreement was buy into all this light.
2017560	2019560	I thought you said that was the first...
2019560	2020560	No, no, no.
2020560	2021560	I was explaining his cosmology.
2021560	2022560	His cosmology is that we're all a dream.
2022560	2023560	Cosmology?
2023560	2024560	I don't know what that word means.
2024560	2025560	I don't think it means makeup tips.
2025560	2026560	It just means map of the universe.
2026560	2028560	Wait, what did you say, sir?
2028560	2031560	Cosmology is the map of the universe?
2031560	2033560	Just a map of the universe, a model of the universe philosophically.
2033560	2034560	I didn't know that.
2034560	2036560	And I appreciate you not judging me for not knowing that word.
2036560	2037560	I don't judge anything anymore.
2037560	2039560	I have four agreements.
2039560	2040560	That might be one of them.
2040560	2041560	Yeah.
2041560	2042560	Don't judge.
2042560	2043560	I don't make assumptions, yeah.
2043560	2045560	Can we have a little judgment jar that you have to put a dollar in every time you judge
2045560	2047560	somebody throughout the rest of the show?
2047560	2048560	That would be good.
2048560	2049560	Okay.
2049560	2052560	I want to keep this bullet train moving because we have so many points here tonight.
2052560	2053560	Judgment cup.
2053560	2055560	Do you want vodka in that?
2055560	2056560	No.
2056560	2057560	Oh, okay.
2057560	2058560	Someone.
2058560	2060560	Every time you judge somebody throughout the rest of this podcast, dollar in the judgment
2060560	2061560	cup.
2061560	2062560	Our friend Curtis Armstrong is here.
2062560	2063560	Curtis Armstrong.
2063560	2064560	Yeah!
2065560	2092560	Curtis, welcome.
2092560	2093560	She's my street buddy.
2093560	2094560	Oh, okay.
2094560	2095560	I ran into her on the street.
2095560	2096560	Oh, is she the one that came up to you?
2096560	2097560	Yeah.
2097560	2103560	She was the one who told me that you were worried that I didn't like you anymore.
2103560	2105560	Don't take it personally.
2105560	2106560	No.
2106560	2110560	When you were in communicado and you were having fun with your daughter, I...
2110560	2111560	No, no, no, no, no.
2111560	2112560	I know.
2112560	2113560	I know.
2113560	2114560	Yeah.
2114560	2115560	You just got a little uncertain.
2115560	2116560	Yeah.
2116560	2118560	You started thinking too much and questioning what you've been doing and saying...
2118560	2121760	Which is really selfish and egomaniacal of me to like translate the things happening
2121760	2123960	in this dream to mean something about me.
2123960	2130760	No, but I think all it was, Dan, was you expressing a very warm, friendly idea that you want Curtis
2130760	2131760	to like you.
2131760	2132760	And you had the courage to say that out loud.
2132760	2133760	And I took it that way.
2133760	2135800	I really did take it that way.
2135800	2138840	And then Leah, correct?
2138840	2144000	Leah stopped me in the street and she said, you have to talk to Dan.
2144000	2148000	I was outside a ramen place and she said, you have to talk to Dan because he's very upset
2148000	2149000	and he thinks.
2149000	2155240	He said that she stood up during the show and told you, Dan, no, he's with his daughter
2155240	2156240	in England.
2156240	2160000	And I said, well, then I guess he doesn't check his tweets.
2160000	2164240	Anyway, that's all behind us now because you're clear on everything and...
2164240	2165240	Yeah.
2165240	2166240	Have you guys ever worked together?
2166240	2167240	Yeah.
2167240	2168240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2168240	2174200	We worked like for three years on a series, an animated series called Dan Verses.
2174200	2175200	And some people...
2175200	2176200	Oh!
2176200	2177200	With Dave Foley.
2177200	2178200	With Dave Foley.
2178200	2180480	With three of us in a room.
2180480	2183480	And I never have laughed so much.
2183480	2184480	I know.
2184480	2185480	It was really fun.
2185480	2189160	We just laughed all the time.
2189160	2195720	And then the show was great and it ran and ran and then the network was canceled.
2195720	2198960	Well, it was this weird thing where we were on...
2198960	2199960	You can never get comfortable.
2199960	2200960	No, it was like...
2200960	2201960	That's exactly what happened.
2201960	2207800	We don't even know yet because it was on The Hub, which was purchased by...
2208400	2215000	Yeah, purchased by Hasbro, thank you, which then was purchased by Nickelodeon.
2215000	2216000	The Germans.
2216000	2217000	The Germans.
2217000	2218000	And then God.
2218000	2219000	I believe it.
2219000	2220000	And now we're back to Hitler again.
2220000	2223880	Hey, they kept saying, your contract is over.
2223880	2225440	Oh, no, wait.
2225440	2227320	You're now owned by the Germans or something.
2227320	2228320	Right.
2228320	2229320	Yes, that's exactly what it was.
2229320	2231800	Actually, Dave and Curtis and I had so much fun.
2231800	2235120	We were like, okay, whatever, Germans were fine.
2235440	2239280	So we were signing on to a show that didn't exist anymore.
2239280	2240280	Right.
2240280	2242280	In first position.
2242280	2243280	Yeah.
2243280	2244280	It was crazy.
2244280	2245280	And we still don't know.
2245280	2246280	I have not heard any.
2246280	2247840	I don't even know if we have a show.
2247840	2249560	You could get a call tomorrow.
2249560	2250560	We could.
2250560	2251560	Dave versus...
2251560	2252560	For them, though, I would do it.
2252560	2253560	Yeah.
2253560	2254560	It was great.
2254560	2258840	Like for you, I would do your show in a hot damn second.
2258840	2260840	Me too.
2260840	2261840	Yeah.
2261840	2262840	I would...
2262840	2263840	Oh, yeah.
2263840	2264840	I would do your show.
2265560	2266560	He's nuts, but he's good.
2266560	2267560	I know.
2267560	2268560	Well, yeah.
2268560	2269560	That's...
2269560	2270560	Keep going.
2270560	2271560	Keep going.
2271560	2272560	That's what I want.
2272560	2273560	Talk to your friend, Curtis, colleague, actor.
2273560	2279600	Pretend I'm not here and I won't take it personally and tell him everything that you would say.
2279600	2283720	If you ran into Curtis at an airport and you go, oh, I guess you just did a season of Dan
2283720	2284720	Harmon's show.
2284720	2285720	What was that like?
2285720	2286720	Okay.
2286720	2289440	You've been working with Dan Harmon, right?
2289440	2290440	I heard that.
2290440	2291440	I am beat red.
2291440	2292440	Yeah.
2292440	2293440	You are.
2294040	2295040	Hold on.
2295040	2296040	Curtis?
2296040	2297040	You know what?
2297040	2299040	I've heard some weird things about Dan.
2299040	2300040	Listen.
2300040	2301040	I know.
2301040	2302040	I know.
2302040	2303040	Curtis, that's not really...
2303040	2307520	Flight 451 to Burbank is now aborting.
2307520	2310200	Flight 451, passenger sitting in zone one are now...
2310200	2311200	I'm in the back.
2311200	2312200	So I'm...
2312200	2313200	Here's the thing, man.
2313200	2314200	I'm not going to lie to you.
2314200	2315520	The hours are long.
2315520	2316880	He's a little crazy.
2316880	2317880	Yeah.
2317880	2322000	Sometimes the scripts are late, but here's the problem.
2322000	2330920	They're so goddamn good that you will end up agreeing to have basically Stockholm syndrome.
2330920	2333760	You will be like, fuck, this guy is so fucking good.
2333760	2334760	I...
2334760	2335760	I don't know.
2335760	2336760	The whole cast is great.
2336760	2337760	No, I know.
2337760	2338760	I know what you're...
2338760	2339760	I know what you're thinking.
2339760	2340760	Look how happy Dan is.
2340760	2341760	Somebody asked me about being on the show.
2341760	2342760	Wait, I didn't hear what he said.
2342760	2343760	Oh!
2343760	2344760	Sorry.
2345760	2346760	What were you talking about this last time?
2346760	2347760	I don't know.
2347760	2348760	He's jerking off and he's drinking.
2348760	2349760	I know.
2349760	2350760	I know.
2350760	2351760	But this is conditional love.
2351760	2352760	Now boarding zone two.
2352760	2353760	Zone two.
2353760	2354760	People see it in zone two.
2354760	2366400	I think I create the deplorable situation so that you have to say that.
2366400	2367400	I think that...
2367400	2371160	I think there's some unconscious drive behind me that, like, because I don't think the time
2371160	2372160	that I...
2372160	2376080	The time that I wasted or the wardrobe supervisor's time that I wasted made the show any better.
2376080	2379400	I think all the things that make the show good can be done very quickly.
2379400	2380400	And I think I...
2380400	2381400	I think I purposely...
2381400	2383440	Or not purposely, because I don't want to...
2383440	2388120	I don't think I'm that fucked up that I do it consciously, but I do believe that unconsciously
2388120	2393920	I'm trying to put myself in a situation where mommy and daddy can say, God, you're a little
2393920	2394920	piece of shit.
2394920	2397960	You're like, we really didn't want you.
2397960	2401000	You know, Roe v. Wade is so close to your conception.
2401000	2402000	I'm gonna...
2402000	2403000	Wait.
2403000	2404000	So close.
2404000	2405000	Wait, stop.
2405000	2406000	Just a photo finish.
2406000	2407000	No.
2407000	2408000	You got...
2408000	2409000	You don't think they told me?
2409000	2410000	No.
2410000	2411000	No.
2411000	2412000	No.
2412000	2413000	I...
2413000	2414000	What?
2414000	2415000	Why else would I know?
2415000	2416000	1973.
2416000	2419920	Look it up.
2419920	2420920	Photo finish.
2420920	2421920	Oh my God.
2421920	2424200	I don't blame them.
2424200	2425200	Like...
2425200	2426200	And then I'm like, okay.
2426200	2428000	And then they're like, whoa, what if I do this?
2428000	2430000	And they're like, well, then, then, okay.
2431000	2432000	And now you're talented.
2432000	2435000	And so I'm like, I need to like drive it to that.
2435000	2436000	But then...
2436000	2437000	No, go ahead.
2437000	2438000	Please.
2438000	2439000	No, Curtis, go.
2439000	2440000	No, no, please.
2440000	2441000	No, no, no, please.
2441000	2442000	All right.
2442000	2444720	Then if everyone could do it quickly, then they would.
2444720	2447800	And you did it the way you needed to do it.
2447800	2448800	Yeah.
2448800	2449800	And that's how it works out.
2449800	2450800	I mean, it just...
2450800	2452560	You do it at the speed that you do.
2452560	2457000	And I would say to him in an airport or at Gelson's, Curtis...
2457000	2458000	Which is where we usually see each other.
2458000	2459000	Which is where we run into each other.
2459000	2460000	Okay, I'm not here.
2460000	2461000	I'm not here.
2461000	2464000	I would say he's nuts, but it's great.
2464000	2465000	Really?
2465000	2466000	It's worth it.
2466000	2467000	You're not a network...
2467000	2468000	Yeah.
2468000	2469000	Oh, yeah.
2469000	2470000	He's not a network TV guy.
2470000	2472000	I've heard that so many times about other people.
2472000	2475000	And it never works out that way.
2475000	2476000	No, he really...
2476000	2481000	People tell me, you know, the guy's really insane, you know, but it's worth it.
2481000	2482000	But he's great.
2482000	2483000	It's never been worth it for me.
2483000	2484000	Okay, I would...
2484000	2487000	Well, because have I ever said to you, this guy's crazy, but it's worth it?
2487000	2488000	Never.
2488000	2489000	I would only say it about him.
2489000	2490000	Okay.
2490000	2491000	Believe me.
2491000	2492000	I'm just a waiter.
2492000	2493000	Could you...
2493000	2494560	Oh, boy.
2494560	2500840	Could you ask your friend for examples of people who haven't been worth it?
2500840	2505520	Just because I'm a waiter and I work at an airport and this is all I have.
2505520	2506520	Bye.
2506520	2508880	Dan, most people aren't worth it.
2508880	2509880	My name's Steve.
2509880	2510880	Oh, sorry.
2510880	2511880	Steve.
2511880	2512880	You know what I mean.
2512880	2514680	I do know exactly what you mean.
2515680	2517680	I've always imagined that that's what working with him was like.
2517680	2519680	He's crazy, but it's so worth it.
2519680	2520680	He's nuts, but it's worth it.
2520680	2521680	Excuse me.
2521680	2522680	Excuse me.
2522680	2523680	Pardon me to interrupt your conversation.
2523680	2524680	I work for the TSA.
2524680	2527680	Have you been approached by someone pretending to be a waiter and not this airport?
2531680	2532680	Stop that waiter!
2532680	2533680	Stop that waiter!
2545680	2548680	The humans are suspicious.
2548680	2552680	He's now on his eye watch.
2552680	2554680	Zone 3 is now boarding.
2554680	2556680	Flight 251 to Birkbeck.
2556680	2557680	Zone 3.
2563680	2565680	Still going, still flying.
2565680	2570680	Mr. President, we've made contact with the alien waiters.
2570680	2573680	Curtis, be the president.
2573680	2577680	Mr. President, as your chief of staff, I feel it's time to get you into the bunker.
2577680	2582680	The alien waiters have invaded the Philadelphia airport.
2582680	2584680	Who's this guy from the White House?
2584680	2586680	Yeah, I don't have any idea.
2586680	2588680	I'm your chief of staff, sir.
2588680	2589680	Oh, that's right.
2589680	2590680	Sorry.
2590680	2591680	Or am I?
2591680	2592680	Patches.
2600680	2601680	Hey!
2601680	2602680	Hey!
2602680	2603680	They're both flying right now.
2603680	2608680	They both are alien faces for the podcast listeners at home.
2613680	2618680	Padgett, you're the head of an elite firm that helps people with their public scandals
2618680	2622680	before they happen, but you're having an affair with President Curtis, which is the biggest
2622680	2625680	scandal of all, and yet your job is to handle scandals.
2628680	2629680	Go!
2629680	2630680	Go!
2631680	2632680	And you both just took a shit.
2632680	2634680	Wait, but I can't...
2634680	2636680	And you can both smell it, but you think it's you.
2636680	2637680	But you don't know.
2637680	2639680	But you both think it's you.
2639680	2643680	Because you're in the Oval Office, and there's two bathrooms.
2643680	2645680	And you both just took a huge shit.
2645680	2648680	And you both think...
2648680	2649680	I don't know if that informs...
2649680	2653680	Is this the moment after he found out his chief of staff is one of the alien waiters?
2653680	2655680	Yeah, he had that meeting.
2655680	2658680	Now it's time for this meeting, where usually you guys like...
2658680	2659680	It's like your personal meeting.
2659680	2663680	I feel like the bit is you over explaining the improv.
2667680	2668680	I would not disagree with that.
2668680	2671680	Which is why I stopped doing improv.
2671680	2675680	That's every note I got after every improv show I ever did.
2675680	2676680	Every performer.
2676680	2680680	We just saw a really good improv last night in a room full of eight people.
2680680	2681680	Who?
2682680	2685680	Aaron, come out here so you can tell us who that was.
2685680	2686680	Aaron McGathey.
2686680	2689680	Aaron McGathey!
2693680	2696680	Our podcast listener, this is Aaron.
2696680	2697680	Dan's wife.
2697680	2702680	She's a great actress, a beautiful redhead, and a sex box.
2703680	2704680	Oh, thank you, Patrick.
2704680	2707680	I was just obsessively fixing my hair backstage.
2707680	2709680	I think I have a Cocker Spaniel thing going.
2709680	2710680	No, I love it.
2710680	2711680	No, it looks beautiful.
2711680	2712680	Thanks, guys.
2712680	2715680	USS Rock and Roll is the group that we saw.
2715680	2718680	Yeah, what are those names of those kids?
2719680	2720680	Annie and...
2720680	2722680	Annie O'Connell.
2722680	2723680	Levon O'Connell.
2723680	2724680	I don't know.
2724680	2725680	O'Connor.
2725680	2727680	Yeah, Annie O'Connor, Levon O'Connor.
2727680	2729680	I love really good long-form improv.
2729680	2730680	Like, it's so different from...
2730680	2732680	Like, short-form improv is like...
2732680	2733680	It's a parlor trick.
2733680	2736680	It's like we learn skills that we can use.
2736680	2738680	I'm saying we because anybody can...
2738680	2739680	I'm not saying I'm good at it.
2739680	2741680	I'm just mean like in short-form improv, which I was trained in,
2741680	2742680	it's like they go,
2742680	2744680	okay, here's all these disciplines.
2744680	2747680	And here's how you use them to make a quarter come out of someone's ear
2747680	2748680	and you could like...
2748680	2749680	Like, Jeff is...
2749680	2752680	You know, does it like on like national television.
2752680	2753680	Is that still a thing?
2753680	2754680	National television?
2754680	2755680	Yeah, it's still national.
2755680	2758680	But when you're in a short-form improv is like...
2758680	2759680	It's like vaudeville.
2759680	2761680	Like, it's like be funny immediately.
2761680	2762680	So you don't really...
2762680	2764680	Like, our friend Derek Mears made a good analogy for short-form improv
2764680	2765680	versus long-form.
2765680	2767680	Short-form is like if you're on a dirt bike,
2767680	2769680	there's a ramp every couple seconds.
2769680	2770680	So you don't ever get that much runway
2771680	2772680	and you don't ever get that much air.
2772680	2774680	Long-form is a lot of runway
2774680	2775680	and you build up a lot of speed.
2775680	2777680	So when a joke hits, you get to fly for a long time.
2777680	2779680	Like, so the payoff is way bigger
2779680	2783680	if you can like make a joke land in a long-form situation.
2783680	2784680	Short-form, like whose line is like,
2784680	2786680	joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.
2786680	2787680	You could also be like...
2787680	2789680	I mean, another way to illustrate the difference
2789680	2792680	is you could show up and walk into a room and go,
2792680	2794680	oh, there's only four other people here.
2794680	2797680	And for a short-form improv show, that pretty much...
2797680	2798680	That doesn't mean it's going to be a bad show.
2798680	2800680	It could be the most memorable show of your life,
2800680	2803680	but depending on how they react backstage.
2803680	2806680	But it generally means this short-form improv engine
2806680	2808680	is not going to get the gas it needs.
2808680	2810680	But if you come in and there's four other people in the room
2810680	2811680	and there's a little black box
2811680	2813680	and you're watching like good disciplines
2813680	2815680	like long-form improv people,
2815680	2818680	I mean, they may do a better show for four people
2818680	2820680	than they could have ever done for 40 people.
2820680	2821680	It's like you walk out...
2821680	2822680	It's like church.
2822680	2825680	I mean, like if you walk into a church and it's emptier.
2825680	2826680	I don't know. It's like so good.
2826680	2829680	There's more God for you.
2829680	2832680	Or Hitler, whatever you want to use as your placeholder.
2832680	2833680	Yeah.
2833680	2835680	Well, I think we saw it just really quick.
2835680	2838680	We saw improv at the now theater in Los Angeles.
2838680	2840680	If you're interested in long-form, improv.
2840680	2841680	That's it.
2841680	2844680	The hardcore shit.
2844680	2845680	All right.
2845680	2848680	That's Craig Kuchowski laughing, improv guru.
2848680	2849680	Right, yeah.
2849680	2853680	Craig, who many community fans know as Officer Kuchowski.
2853680	2854680	Officer Kuchowski.
2854680	2856680	He's also in the Thirling Adventure Hour.
2856680	2858680	Ten years strong.
2858680	2860680	Hey, Officer Craig Kuchowski, come up.
2860680	2861680	Let's do it.
2861680	2862680	Long-form improv show.
2862680	2864680	Long-form improv show.
2868680	2869680	I will say this.
2869680	2873680	While Craig is coming up, long-form improv will be me.
2873680	2876680	Let me show you what I mean when I say long-form improv.
2876680	2877680	Here we go.
2877680	2885680	I heard plumber and I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard wrapped.
2885680	2887680	All right.
2887680	2888680	I love it.
2888680	2891680	Just real quick, we promised Craig backstage we literally would not do this.
2891680	2892680	I know.
2892680	2893680	That's my joke.
2893680	2894680	That's my joke.
2894680	2895680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2895680	2896680	Sometimes my jokes have an audience of love.
2896680	2897680	You don't want to be a part of this pageant?
2897680	2900680	No, I'm scared.
2900680	2902680	Do you want a suggestion or anything?
2902680	2903680	I heard plumber and wrap.
2903680	2904680	That's all I heard.
2904680	2905680	Plumber and wrap.
2905680	2906680	You heard plumber and wrap?
2906680	2907680	I thought I did.
2907680	2908680	Okay.
2908680	2909680	All right.
2909680	2913680	Oh, that must be that wrapping plumber I ordered.
2913680	2918680	Can you hear me some music?
2918680	2926680	I do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
2927680	2939680	Well, my job is to unplug your toilet, but I don't want you today, because I want to help you differently.
2940680	2942680	My name is Kevin.
2946680	2947680	Okay, Kevin.
2947680	2949680	Well, the toilet's pretty clogged.
2949680	2950680	No, it's not.
2950680	2959680	Well, well, well, well, well, my name is wrapping plumber and I'm here to stay.
2959680	2963680	I like to unplug your toilet in a different way.
2963680	2967680	I'm the star of the show and I wrap all the time.
2967680	2970680	And improv is great, because I like to rhyme.
2970680	2974680	My name is wrapity, wrapity, wrapity, wrapity, wrap.
2974680	2982680	Do, do I give you the group on now?
2982680	2983680	No.
2983680	2984680	Okay.
2984680	2989680	Hi, honey, honey, I, I heard, I heard that Kevin's here.
2989680	2990680	No, I'm not.
2994680	2996680	I was a ghost the whole time.
2996680	2998680	I was just haunting the scene.
2998680	3000680	I'm from Hitler and God's world.
3000680	3001680	You know what I mean.
3001680	3003680	I'm going to moonwalk.
3003680	3005680	Downstage for you.
3005680	3007680	I'm an improv master.
3007680	3008680	This is what I do.
3008680	3009680	Break it down.
3009680	3015680	Improv, improv, improv, improv, improv.
3015680	3023680	I know, I know we're only supposed to call the number if we feel threatened.
3023680	3025680	No, they're not.
3025680	3032680	What time is it?
3032680	3035680	It's a, no, it's not.
3035680	3037680	I didn't even tell you what time it was.
3037680	3038680	No, you didn't.
3038680	3045680	Two hours earlier before Kevin the wrapping plumber showed up at the house.
3045680	3050680	This better be good.
3050680	3051680	Well, God damn it.
3051680	3054680	I've been plumbing this thing and it's just nuts.
3054680	3058680	I know, honey, and you're so good at plumbing this thing.
3058680	3059680	You are.
3059680	3064680	And I'm so sorry for making this mess.
3064680	3073680	And I know that the only plumber in town is schizophrenic.
3073680	3078680	Why did we move to this tiny town?
3078680	3082680	Well, we went down in Omaha in 73.
3082680	3084680	We didn't know what we would do.
3084680	3086680	We lived in a tree.
3086680	3101680	We had only $4 to our name, so we decided to get in the Omaha game.
3101680	3103680	Still, Omaha is a fairly large city.
3103680	3108680	Four years earlier in Omaha.
3108680	3113680	As the mayor of, hello, sorry.
3113680	3123680	As the mayor of New York, I clearly got on the wrong flight.
3123680	3129680	Four years later, back in the house.
3129680	3132680	Remember when the mayor of New York was on our flight to Omaha?
3132680	3133680	That was so.
3133680	3134680	That was a weird day.
3134680	3135680	That was so surreal.
3135680	3136680	That was a very weird day.
3136680	3138680	There was so much security.
3138680	3140680	The test came back.
3140680	3142680	It's you, not me.
3142680	3155680	I can have children, and you can't.
3155680	3159680	Look, I make so much money as an insurance executive here in Omaha.
3159680	3165680	I know, and that's why I'm with you.
3165680	3171680	It feels good when we state our subtext.
3171680	3176680	Well, I better leave because you need to take a big shit.
3176680	3183680	You know, I know that sounds weird, but I appreciate that you know when I need to take big shits.
3183680	3186680	I can just read it on your face.
3186680	3193680	And you're impeccable with your word.
3193680	3199680	All right, long form motherfucking improv.
3199680	3201680	Craig Kakowski.
3201680	3204680	Craig Kakowski, thank you, brother.
3204680	3211680	Hey, Craig probably doesn't need to plug anything, does he?
3211680	3214680	You guys can come back now, the theatrical person.
3214680	3216680	You notice Padgett and Curtis fled over here for safety?
3216680	3217680	No, because they're actors.
3217680	3220680	They're like, fucking give them space.
3220680	3222680	You can resume receipts.
3222680	3224680	The improv is over, you're good.
3224680	3227680	Oh, hello, officer.
3227680	3229680	Mr. Pickles.
3229680	3231680	Now, let me ask you a question.
3231680	3236680	Dan, you know improv is yes and not no.
3236680	3238680	Wait, what?
3238680	3241680	No, it's rapping and saying no.
3241680	3244680	Where did you guys learn improv?
3244680	3247680	Oh, I'm sorry, were you looking at your watch?
3247680	3249680	No, I was writing things down.
3249680	3253680	Okay, improv is yes and not no.
3253680	3254680	Ideally, yeah.
3254680	3257680	Okay, you know that.
3257680	3260680	That's my bit.
3260680	3262680	Your improv is no.
3262680	3266680	And then rapping and standing literally in front of Craig Kakowski, which was funny.
3266680	3269680	It should just be a yes and rap.
3269680	3271680	Your rap was stellar.
3271680	3272680	Thank you.
3272680	3273680	Right?
3273680	3275680	It's all anyone will remember anyway.
3275680	3277680	Yeah, you're right.
3277680	3280680	My favorite 30 Rock joke.
3280680	3285680	I love 30 Rock, but the best joke, well, my favorite one.
3285680	3291680	They alluded to the fact that Liz Lemon and now I can't even remember her friend's name.
3291680	3294680	That is the host of the original show.
3294680	3296680	Whatever, Jen?
3296680	3300680	Yeah, they alluded to the fact that they met doing improv workshops.
3300680	3301680	I've told this a thousand times.
3301680	3302680	It's just my favorite thing.
3302680	3306680	They just flash back to Tina Fey.
3306680	3311680	They're just sitting in all black, and they're sitting in these two chairs, and there's a little black box.
3311680	3317680	And they go, okay, the suggestions are Sling Blade and Oprah Winfrey.
3317680	3326680	And Liz Lemon kind of centers herself and then goes, I sure like those French fried potatoes.
3326680	3331680	And then Jenna goes, no, you don't, Oprah.
3331680	3334680	And then it just goes back.
3334680	3342680	All of the all of the sitcom like whip pan flashbacks that we've had to suffer, that was the that was made it all worth it.
3342680	3345680	It was so funny.
3345680	3349680	Okay, Craig has been my teacher and coach a billion times over.
3349680	3350680	I'm sorry.
3350680	3352680	I am.
3352680	3353680	Turn that phone right now.
3353680	3354680	It's time.
3354680	3355680	It's time to say this.
3355680	3356680	It's the bad beeping.
3356680	3357680	Turn it off.
3357680	3358680	Sorry about the subtext thing.
3358680	3359680	And I'm starting to go.
3359680	3363680	I'm sorry about going to the infant infertility place.
3363680	3364680	Done it before.
3364680	3365680	Take up.
3365680	3366680	Don't take a person.
3366680	3367680	Don't take a person.
3367680	3368680	No.
3368680	3369680	God damn it.
3369680	3370680	That's true.
3370680	3371680	That's that's the most important thing.
3371680	3372680	And I screwed up.
3372680	3373680	Aaron.
3373680	3376680	My favorite thing of that was it is going to the infertility place.
3376680	3378680	A hack premise because I wanted this.
3378680	3381680	It is for all Aaron McGathey.
3381680	3382680	It's not.
3382680	3383680	Yeah.
3383680	3384680	Yeah.
3384680	3386680	Yeah.
3386680	3387680	What?
3387680	3388680	We go by that clock.
3388680	3389680	Oh, yeah.
3389680	3390680	It's 9 11.
3390680	3391680	Oh, it's 9 11.
3391680	3392680	Wait a minute.
3392680	3393680	I know.
3393680	3394680	I know.
3394680	3396680	It's just something we do.
3396680	3399680	We do this all the time.
3399680	3402680	It's really disturbing the first time it happens.
3402680	3403680	No.
3403680	3407680	I'm asking about Jeff Davis wanting kids.
3407680	3412680	Oh, you mean the real 9 11.
3413680	3416680	The real the real biggest tragedy.
3416680	3417680	Patrick.
3417680	3418680	Aren't you married right now?
3418680	3419680	Yeah.
3419680	3420680	Now.
3420680	3421680	You sexy dirt.
3421680	3422680	Shut up.
3422680	3423680	Shut up.
3423680	3428680	I'm going to get in so much trouble.
3428680	3429680	It was a long time ago.
3429680	3430680	It was a long time ago.
3430680	3431680	We were both young.
3431680	3432680	We were very young.
3432680	3433680	But it was great.
3433680	3434680	And two.
3434680	3435680	Wait.
3435680	3436680	What was like a long time ago?
3436680	3437680	We had a little thing.
3437680	3438680	What?
3438680	3439680	We had a very.
3439680	3441680	We did it for like 45 minutes a long time ago.
3441680	3442680	Well, no, I'm playing.
3442680	3445680	It was longer than 45 minutes.
3445680	3446680	All right.
3446680	3447680	Fine.
3447680	3448680	They dated.
3448680	3449680	I was not the one that brought it up.
3449680	3450680	You guys brought it up.
3450680	3451680	They dated.
3451680	3452680	All right.
3452680	3453680	Every time I work with you, I find out.
3453680	3454680	I know.
3454680	3455680	This is really true.
3455680	3464680	The last time I worked with her, there was another person involved in what we were doing.
3464680	3466680	And it was this.
3466680	3470680	It was like, oh, you know, like the eyes getting all remember that.
3470680	3473680	You know, you dated a lot.
3473680	3474680	I did.
3474680	3475680	Heard of.
3475680	3476680	Padgett.
3476680	3480680	I still have two of your wigs, by the way, at my house, which I wear quite frequently.
3480680	3481680	Oh, God.
3481680	3483680	I got the red wig, the short red wig.
3483680	3484680	You do?
3484680	3485680	And the long red wig.
3485680	3486680	Oh, my God.
3486680	3488680	My landlord's son wanted that wig.
3488680	3490680	And I couldn't find it.
3490680	3496680	I have the weirdest boner.
3496680	3497680	It's not my joke.
3497680	3498680	It's Donald Glover's.
3498680	3499680	Wait.
3499680	3500680	Okay.
3500680	3501680	All right.
3501680	3502680	So.
3502680	3503680	I'm sorry.
3503680	3504680	Wait.
3504680	3505680	Padgett just said her landlord's son wanted that wig.
3505680	3506680	What do you mean?
3506680	3507680	Well, back at, not now.
3507680	3510680	I mean, I own a home now.
3510680	3512680	She's sophisticated now.
3512680	3514680	But there was a day when.
3514680	3515680	No.
3515680	3522680	I lost a couple of wigs to Jeff Davis back in the day, and that's fine.
3523680	3527680	Listen, every woman loses a couple of wigs to Jeff.
3527680	3528680	That's fine.
3528680	3531680	Padgett, you weren't the first and you want me the last.
3531680	3532680	I know.
3532680	3537680	Do you have, Padgett, do you have a, you're very experienced and you've been very...
3537680	3538680	What's going to happen?
3538680	3539680	Do you have an STD?
3539680	3540680	I'm changing.
3540680	3541680	No.
3541680	3542680	No, I know.
3542680	3543680	It's amazing.
3543680	3546680	I cannot believe it.
3546680	3550680	I thought by now I would have something awful.
3550680	3551680	No.
3551680	3552680	I feel the same way.
3552680	3553680	It's a fucking miracle, right?
3553680	3554680	Isn't it amazing?
3554680	3555680	It's a miracle.
3555680	3556680	Because you got around too.
3556680	3557680	I'm a condom.
3557680	3558680	I'm safe.
3558680	3559680	Yes.
3559680	3561680	We both use condoms.
3561680	3564680	Together and with other people.
3564680	3565680	But still.
3565680	3570680	Actually, truth be told, I used to put your wigs on my dick and fuck it with a wig.
3570680	3573680	That I do remember.
3573680	3577680	All of Hermitown is led up to this point.
3578680	3581680	This is the most important moment.
3581680	3586680	Well, I was going to ask you just because I didn't want to be remiss in having you on
3586680	3587680	stage.
3587680	3592680	Like we farted around and had fun, but you're a performer that has been funny for a very
3592680	3597680	long time and probably is admired by a lot of people when they watch you on screen and
3597680	3598680	stuff.
3598680	3600680	But it was just so that I'm not remiss as an interviewer.
3600680	3601680	I don't want to do my job wrong.
3601680	3607680	Like, is there a philosophy that you follow because your ability to, as I wrote, be the
3607680	3610680	person that dropped in and nailed it?
3610680	3611680	You wrote that.
3611680	3613680	I wrote that as a Valentine to everything you had done.
3613680	3614680	For me.
3614680	3615680	Yeah.
3615680	3616680	Which was lovely.
3616680	3617680	I wrote everything you said, motherfucker.
3617680	3618680	No, I know.
3618680	3619680	No, I'm just saying.
3619680	3620680	Don't you forget it.
3620680	3626680	No, but the fact that you wrote for me to say in the last episode as someone who came
3627680	3628680	late and nailed it.
3628680	3635680	And I was so scared to say it because I didn't know at that point if I had like to me, I
3635680	3636680	didn't know.
3636680	3639680	But no, no, I just did to you what Aaron does to me all the time.
3639680	3640680	I'm so sorry.
3640680	3641680	I just do it.
3641680	3644680	No, I like you.
3644680	3645680	Never mind.
3645680	3646680	Can we put a pin in that?
3646680	3647680	I missed it.
3647680	3648680	Can we put a pin in that?
3648680	3649680	I missed it too.
3649680	3650680	No, I was put a pin in that.
3650680	3651680	I just want to.
3651680	3652680	Oh my God.
3652680	3653680	This has become something else.
3653680	3654680	No, no, no.
3654680	3655680	Like, like, well, is there anything?
3655680	3665680	Like, before you step in front of eight fucking giant cameras, 5,000 lights, 200 people dangling
3665680	3666680	from rafters.
3666680	3670840	You know, like, is there like different actors say different things about how are they able
3670840	3675680	to do comedy or drama or anything in that totally artificial environment?
3675680	3680120	Because all we see on the screen is it's because of the courtesy of these craftsmen who make
3680120	3684840	things look like a living room and look like a courtroom in Mississippi in 1950.
3684840	3687360	Like, all we see is reality and then these amazing actors.
3687360	3692160	And we don't realize that it's like, Jesus Christ, the environment is so unnatural.
3692160	3698480	And you get, like, particularly comedic actors are able to exude all of this, like, weird
3698480	3699480	human energy.
3699480	3700480	Is there anything that you do?
3700480	3703120	Do you kneel in front of a mirror in your trailer?
3703120	3704120	Do you remind yourself?
3704120	3705120	Do you have a mantra?
3705120	3706120	Okay.
3706120	3707120	Are you crazy?
3707360	3717320	I'm going to say, this is Dan being a really generous, thoughtful man, podcaster, interviewer.
3717320	3719120	He doesn't have to ask this.
3719120	3720120	No, I wanted to.
3720120	3723720	The only thing I care about in working, no, you shouldn't.
3723720	3724720	Wait, I don't have to.
3724720	3727880	Because that question is like, oh, what do you have to promote?
3727880	3728880	You're an actress.
3728880	3730720	I'm saying because a lot of them out there want to do what you do.
3730720	3732680	No, yeah, but they don't.
3732680	3738240	They want to, like, be home with their families and, like, maybe take a course.
3738240	3739440	Totally misunderstood our audience.
3739440	3744720	Wait, no, I'm saying, no, no, no, you're being very giving and loving and supportive
3744720	3748160	and thoughtful and saying, oh, what do you have to do for this character?
3748160	3749160	I don't.
3749160	3750160	I just show up.
3750160	3752760	And I say the lines, and I do the best I can.
3752760	3753760	Is there anything?
3753760	3756120	And you write great lines, and that's why I was there.
3756120	3758560	So, it's, she a pro.
3758560	3762680	When you're in front of the, when you're in front of the camera, what, you know.
3762680	3767560	Okay, when I was younger, I thought, how does my hair look?
3767560	3771000	Am I hiding the size of my nose?
3771000	3773040	Do I have all my wigs?
3773040	3778600	Or is that guy I was dating, did he take them?
3778600	3779600	You gave them to me.
3779600	3780600	You're thinking about other things.
3780600	3782120	I asked you for them, and you gave them to me.
3782120	3784480	Of course I gave them to you.
3784480	3786520	You were a great boyfriend.
3786520	3793320	Okay, pretend you're at an airport with Curtis.
3793320	3804720	Actually, I think Curtis and I will be performing our long form farting president and presidential
3804720	3812960	aide improv at Ghelton's in Silver Lake sometime over the next two months.
3813960	3815240	We're not announcing the time.
3815240	3817440	You just have to luck into being there.
3817440	3819040	It's like a rave to let you know.
3819040	3820040	Because we don't, yeah.
3820040	3821040	Skrillex will tell you.
3821040	3822840	You have to be on Skrillex's Instagram.
3822840	3825080	You just have to be there at the right time.
3825080	3826080	Curtis, do you have a ritual?
3826080	3827080	Do you have a technique?
3827080	3828080	Do you have a mantra?
3828080	3833480	Do you have a threshold you have to cross before you step in front of cameras?
3833480	3834480	I don't.
3834480	3837880	I was thinking about this recently.
3837880	3842080	Did I tell you about finding my booger biography?
3842080	3843080	You did, yes.
3843080	3845280	Because that was what I used to do.
3845280	3854160	I actually found in a notebook, because I was trained as an actor, and what you do as
3854160	3859440	an actor is in order to understand your character, you write a biography of it.
3859440	3863400	And no one will ever know what you've written, but you'll know and that's why you do that.
3863400	3871480	And I found my biography that I wrote in 1983 for booger as to who she was.
3872480	3876320	And that was what I used to do.
3876320	3883440	I don't do it anymore because no one ever gives me roles where they actually start in
3883440	3885560	a place and end in a place.
3885560	3886960	Those don't really happen that much anymore.
3886960	3888440	Well my friend, that's about to change.
3888440	3889440	Give me a beat.
3889440	3890440	Oh, what's going on?
3890440	3892520	I like to do the roof.
3892520	3895680	I like to do the roof.
3895680	3896680	Thank you.
3896680	3897680	How was it?
3897680	3898680	Yeah.
3898680	3899680	I just, I just, yeah.
3899680	3900680	I liked it.
3900680	3901680	I don't know what it was but.
3901680	3902680	It was pretty much.
3902680	3913680	I thought you were about to go into some nice long form improv for us.
3913680	3917240	Like I could give him a role tonight on this stage.
3917240	3919240	Well it looked like that's what you're going to do.
3919240	3921240	But you would have to go off and write a biography.
3921240	3922240	Well okay.
3922240	3923240	No, no.
3923240	3924240	I don't do that anymore.
3924240	3925240	I did that.
3925240	3926240	I did that in the past.
3926240	3927240	All right.
3927240	3928240	Let's do it.
3928240	3929240	Okay.
3929240	3930240	So you, I'm your, let's, I'm your dad.
3930240	3931240	Okay.
3931240	3932240	You.
3932240	3933240	I'm not an improv guy.
3933240	3934680	So if you're really expecting improv.
3934680	3935680	No, no, no.
3935680	3942520	But we want, this is just going to be like, like, you've already done more than enough
3942520	3945680	in like Shadowrun to know, you get, this is, that's the level of improv.
3945680	3946680	You just.
3946680	3947680	I mean, don't worry.
3947680	3949680	I'm going to say somebody who's going to disagree with everything you say.
3949680	3950680	No, no, no.
3950680	3951680	I'm not going to do that.
3951680	3952680	Oh my God.
3952680	3953680	What is going on with you two?
3953680	3954680	Can I be your counselor?
3954680	3955680	Can I be your counselor?
3955680	3959680	Can I ask the, when you do X, I feel X.
3959680	3960680	What was that thing that we put the pin in?
3960680	3961680	Yeah, it was a thing we put a pin in.
3961680	3962680	About the thing that she does.
3962680	3963680	Oh, no, no.
3963680	3964680	It was just, you can't get it a topic.
3964680	3965680	It was just, it was derailed.
3965680	3966680	Let's do this.
3966680	3972680	I, I get, it's just, it would, I'm your dad and I.
3972680	3973680	Oh my God.
3973680	3975960	You're, you're at the breakfast table.
3975960	3976960	Yeah.
3976960	3979960	You just found a joint under your mattress in your bedroom.
3979960	3982960	Uh, uh, hey dad.
3982960	3983960	Morning.
3983960	3984960	Good morning.
3984960	3989960	Did you care to explain this?
3989960	3993960	I, I, I, uh, I don't know what that is.
3993960	3994960	But you should.
3994960	3995960	It's under your mattress.
3995960	4000960	Oh, it must've, it must've, it must've come with the mattress.
4000960	4003960	It's, it's not mine.
4003960	4007960	I, I gotta get to school.
4007960	4009960	You got the day off, mister.
4009960	4011960	Cause you're going to talk to me.
4011960	4014960	Because you could go to school every day for the rest of your life.
4014960	4017960	And if you keep making choices like that, it's not going to matter.
4017960	4022960	I went to Vietnam for you.
4022960	4024960	Not for my country.
4024960	4027960	I fucking hate America.
4027960	4031960	I went to Vietnam for you.
4031960	4034960	How old do you think I am?
4034960	4037960	I think you're 17.
4037960	4040960	I'm 32.
4040960	4041960	What year is this?
4041960	4043960	It's 2015.
4043960	4044960	Oh, it's now.
4044960	4049960	I went to Vietnam for you to get that mattress.
4049960	4053960	It's ostrich skin.
4053960	4054960	It's expensive.
4054960	4055960	I'm sorry, dad.
4055960	4056960	I'm experimenting.
4056960	4057960	I'm reaching out.
4057960	4058960	I'm trying new things.
4058960	4062960	The fucking mattress doesn't care about your coming of age.
4062960	4066960	I could've gone to Sears if I knew you were going to put shit that's on fire under it.
4066960	4068960	Well, dad, you were in numb.
4068960	4070960	Did you never take drugs in numb?
4070960	4071960	Of course I did.
4071960	4073960	I didn't put it under my fucking mattress.
4073960	4074960	Then why are you yelling at me?
4074960	4076960	It's an expensive mattress.
4076960	4078960	It's ostrich skin.
4078960	4080960	Dad, I don't smoke the mattress.
4080960	4082960	I just put the joints there.
4082960	4087960	See that you don't smoke the mattress.
4088960	4090960	This thing has brown on the end of it.
4090960	4093960	That means that when you put it under there, it could've been red.
4093960	4094960	Okay, all right.
4094960	4095960	Have you ever heard these stories?
4095960	4096960	Yes.
4096960	4097960	Embers could burn for a month.
4097960	4098960	I'm sorry.
4098960	4099960	You could burst into flames.
4099960	4100960	I'm sorry.
4100960	4101960	Be careful.
4101960	4107960	I'm really glad that we had this talk, though, because you don't talk to me that much.
4108960	4117960	Well, let's talk now.
4121960	4124960	Dad, what are you doing?
4124960	4127960	Pouring a bowl of grape nuts.
4127960	4130960	Oh, okay.
4130960	4133960	It's called space work.
4138960	4140960	Hello?
4140960	4143960	Dad, that was milk.
4143960	4144960	Hello?
4144960	4147960	Dad, it's milk for your grape nuts.
4147960	4148960	Milk?
4148960	4152960	I just gave you the milk for your grape nuts.
4152960	4153960	Milk?
4153960	4155960	Milk is calling me.
4155960	4156960	Take it.
4156960	4159960	Um, yeah, uh, milk.
4159960	4162960	I'm just sitting here with...
4162960	4164960	My son, everything's fine.
4164960	4166960	Look at your watch.
4166960	4168960	Look at your watch.
4168960	4170960	Look at your...
4170960	4171960	Milk?
4171960	4172960	It doesn't mean anything.
4172960	4173960	Milk?
4173960	4174960	Milk?
4174960	4175960	Why would you say something like that?
4175960	4177960	I've trusted you forever.
4177960	4178960	It's your watch.
4178960	4180960	Watch, watch, watch.
4180960	4183960	My watch and my milk are talking to me, son.
4183960	4186960	Your son is important.
4186960	4188960	You're important.
4188960	4191960	Your son is important.
4192960	4195960	Your son is important.
4198960	4199960	Dad?
4199960	4200960	You okay?
4200960	4203960	My son is important.
4204960	4207960	Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam...
4207960	4209960	Dad, you okay?
4209960	4210960	Dad?
4210960	4211960	Mom?
4211960	4212960	What?
4212960	4213960	Your son is important.
4213960	4214960	Vietnam...
4214960	4215960	Your son is important.
4215960	4217960	Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.
4217960	4220960	Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.
4229960	4231960	My son is important.
4238960	4240960	My son is important.
4242960	4244960	County line, 3,000 miles.
4244960	4246960	My son is important.
4248960	4253960	Three days later, my son is important.
4258960	4260960	I need a doorbell.
4261960	4263960	My son is important.
4264960	4266960	Is this Don's doorbells?
4267960	4270960	Is your doorbell a real doorbell?
4270960	4272960	I thought it was, I assumed.
4272960	4273960	I'm sorry.
4273960	4275960	Yes, it's a real doorbell.
4275960	4277960	You just walked into my house.
4277960	4279960	Oh, I thought it was Don's doorbells
4279960	4282960	and I assumed that the doorbell on the outside was just a...
4282960	4284960	I'm sorry.
4284960	4287960	Don's doorbells was run by my son downstairs.
4287960	4288960	Sorry, what?
4289960	4290960	Your son Don?
4290960	4292960	You need to just close the door and then try to talk to me.
4293960	4295960	Your son is important.
4296960	4297960	Bing, bong.
4298960	4299960	Uh-oh.
4299960	4300960	Uh-oh.
4300960	4301960	Yeah.
4302960	4303960	Ooh.
4304960	4305960	Your son is important.
4305960	4308960	Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.
4308960	4310960	Thank you. Don's doorbells is downstairs.
4310960	4311960	Thank you.
4322960	4324960	You get the idea.
4324960	4325960	Oh.
4329960	4331960	Mike Myers must have been so young.
4346960	4348960	Jeff, are we still in the improv?
4349960	4352960	Should I run Don's doorbells?
4352960	4353960	Yes, yeah.
4353960	4354960	Don.
4354960	4355960	Hello.
4355960	4356960	Don, it's me.
4356960	4358960	Don's doorbells here.
4358960	4361960	I'm slightly Scottish, slightly Irish.
4361960	4363960	What's happening?
4365960	4367960	I love doorbells.
4367960	4369960	And you are?
4372960	4374960	I am my son's father.
4374960	4376960	My son is important.
4376960	4377960	Donna's important.
4377960	4380960	Do you need me to call 911?
4381960	4384960	Yes.
4384960	4386960	And one.
4390960	4391960	We got it.
4391960	4393960	God's fucking bad.
4393960	4394960	An extra one, yeah.
4394960	4396960	Perfect.
4400960	4402960	I almost blew it.
4402960	4405960	But then I added the extra one.
4405960	4406960	That's good.
4406960	4409960	Did Curtis' character really go from point A to point B?
4409960	4411960	Did we really see that develop?
4411960	4413960	Or is that just another one of those one-note Curtis?
4413960	4415960	See, this is what I mean.
4415960	4417960	I think Curtis did a great job.
4417960	4418960	I thought I was going somewhere.
4418960	4419960	I didn't really go anywhere.
4419960	4420960	You know what I did wrong?
4420960	4422960	I endowed Curtis with a low status character.
4422960	4424960	Curtis, I am...
4424960	4426960	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4426960	4428960	The love of God.
4428960	4430960	Can I overrule this, Dan?
4430960	4433960	I say if we're going to do any more Curtis character development,
4433960	4436960	we save it for Shadow Run, everybody.
4436960	4437960	Shadow Run.
4439960	4442960	Okay, so we got Nightblade.
4442960	4443960	We got...
4443960	4445960	We should bring Demorge up here.
4445960	4447960	Demorge Brown to the stage, please.
4447960	4448960	Demorge Brown.
4451960	4454960	A cavalcade of stars tonight at Harman's house.
4455960	4456960	Oh, yeah.
4460960	4463960	Demorge, why don't you sit here.
4463960	4465960	Sit here and take this mic.
4465960	4467960	But I could stand.
4468960	4469960	No, I can make do.
4470960	4474960	I will say Spencer is still sitting lower than the sea level.
4474960	4475960	That's true.
4475960	4478960	I was thinking, you know, they also have taller chairs.
4478960	4481960	It's a real confluence of factors here.
4482960	4483960	Confluence, good word.
4483960	4484960	We're having too much fun.
4484960	4485960	Thank you, thank you.
4485960	4486960	No, you want a taller chair.
4486960	4487960	Padgett, we have to...
4487960	4488960	I'm fine.
4488960	4490960	We probably have to get Padgett up to speed on what the hell we're doing here, right?
4490960	4491960	Padgett, are you familiar with...
4491960	4492960	What?
4492960	4493960	Should I get out?
4493960	4494960	No, no, you're staying with us for certain.
4494960	4495960	We'd like you to help us play a game.
4495960	4496960	It's like a role-playing game.
4496960	4498960	Oh, it's called Dungeons and Dragons?
4498960	4499960	It is.
4499960	4500960	It's like them.
4500960	4501960	It's called Shadow Run.
4501960	4503960	Oh, this I don't know.
4503960	4506960	Think of it kind of like The Matrix, The Future.
4506960	4511960	We're kind of like mercenaries, like badasses for hire.
4511960	4513960	And what role will Padgett be playing, Spencer?
4513960	4514960	Well, see, that's the deal.
4514960	4517960	I mean, we've got a whole group of people here.
4518960	4519960	Dan, you have a chair coming in?
4519960	4522960	Yeah, I don't have a character sheet for Hack.
4522960	4523960	That's the problem.
4523960	4524960	I have done this.
4524960	4525960	Because he's a plot device.
4525960	4526960	You know what?
4526960	4527960	No, I'll do it.
4527960	4528960	No, no, no.
4528960	4530960	I think she should do Dr. Friend.
4530960	4531960	No, no, you're Dr. Friend.
4531960	4532960	All right.
4532960	4533960	I'll do Dr. Friend.
4533960	4534960	Well, wait.
4534960	4535960	Let's hear him out.
4535960	4536960	Let's hear him out.
4536960	4542200	Well, I was just thinking that maybe Dr. Friend, maybe what has happened is Dr. Friend has
4542200	4552960	gone into sort of a time warp time thing and has changed and is now being played temporarily
4552960	4553960	by Padgett.
4553960	4554960	I don't know what's happening.
4554960	4556960	We don't actually have too many people, do we?
4556960	4557960	We do have too many people.
4557960	4558960	Where's he, O'Donnell?
4558960	4559960	We have too many people.
4559960	4560960	I'm telling you.
4560960	4561960	Jim Nightblade.
4561960	4562960	Trust me.
4562960	4563960	Hodor.
4563960	4564960	Why would I lie to you?
4564960	4565960	Spencer, oh, my God.
4565960	4566960	I love you.
4566960	4567960	You are the most honest.
4567960	4572960	I am willing to stand by the side and cheer everyone on.
4572960	4578960	Spencer, is it possible to have, without anybody else being Hack Eye, maybe Padgett?
4578960	4580960	What's a Hack Eye?
4580960	4582960	Hack Eye is a character that you have.
4582960	4583960	Can I be a Hack Eye?
4583960	4584960	Spencer!
4584960	4585960	What?
4585960	4588960	Could she be some sort of NPC and come and join the classroom?
4588960	4589960	Can I be an NPC?
4589960	4590960	Well, yeah.
4590960	4592960	I mean, there's all sorts of things that we could do successfully.
4592960	4598960	I mean, I'm telling you now, it's just I don't have a character sheet for an extra character.
4598960	4600960	So if you don't need a sheet, if you're-
4600960	4601960	We all walk away.
4601960	4602960	We all have this-
4602960	4603960	We all have this day forever.
4603960	4609960	We all have those days where we feel different than we do the day before.
4609960	4613960	I call those, I guess that's every day.
4613960	4620960	But maybe, would it be okay if Padgett was, like, my memories?
4620960	4621960	Jeff just made a-
4621960	4622960	Oh, walk away.
4622960	4628960	Jeff just made an interesting pitch that it would take Spencer's yes to go with this.
4628960	4629960	That what we do is-
4629960	4630960	Take our shirts off.
4630960	4631960	No, I'm not.
4631960	4632960	No.
4632960	4634960	We give everybody two wigs.
4634960	4640960	We do a very special episode where we do a flashback and find out about Dr. Friend's
4640960	4641960	origins.
4641960	4647960	But it would have to be like, I mean, Spencer would be off the grid, off the map.
4647960	4648960	Oh, yeah.
4648960	4652960	It would be a real improv show.
4652960	4653960	Spencer.
4653960	4656960	Which, I mean, you guys are the masters of that thing.
4656960	4657960	I think if I, you know-
4657960	4662960	Spencer, your job would be maybe to just define whatever needs to be defined in the spatial-
4662960	4663960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4663960	4664960	Yeah, and change scenes.
4664960	4665960	I'm just, yeah.
4665960	4667960	You guys gotta do some lifting, though.
4667960	4669960	What is going on?
4669960	4674960	Can I just leave and go to the bathroom and call my mom?
4674960	4676960	No, Padgett, Padgett, we need you for this.
4676960	4677960	You're an actor and we need you for this.
4677960	4678960	No, you need someone to leave.
4678960	4679960	I will be that person.
4679960	4680960	No.
4680960	4681960	What is happening?
4681960	4685960	Padgett, we're going on a magic carpet ride right now and you're on board for this.
4685960	4686960	We've done that before.
4686960	4687960	We need you more than your mom.
4687960	4692960	I'm just asking for this to be happening.
4692960	4695960	Spencer, I'm sorry you had to see this.
4695960	4696960	You're fine.
4696960	4698960	Don't worry about it.
4698960	4703960	Please tell me that's how Jeff initiates sex.
4703960	4709960	You want to go on a magic carpet ride?
4709960	4710960	Bingo.
4710960	4711960	Dan, why don't you-
4711960	4713960	I'll co-DM with Spencer.
4713960	4719960	Co-DM and at least, Dan, go over with Spencer and you guys together come up with the- you
4719960	4722960	do the intro for wherever we are and set-
4722960	4723960	This is going to be bad.
4723960	4726960	Oh, he did it.
4726960	4727960	Jesus.
4727960	4730960	Let me tell you, that chair is the wrong height.
4730960	4738960	Guys, nobody gets a chair, a folding Ikea chair over an audience like Dan Harmon.
4738960	4742960	He's crazy, but he's great.
4742960	4746960	Padgett, this is your wheelhouse because you're also on an amazing show called Thrilling Adventure
4746960	4748960	Hour where you are in a radio show.
4748960	4750960	With a bunch of people here.
4750960	4751960	A bunch of people here.
4751960	4752960	They know it.
4752960	4757960	We're not using character sheets.
4757960	4758960	We're freestyling this.
4758960	4760960	This is the origin story of Padgett.
4760960	4762960	Curtis' character is Dr. Friend.
4762960	4765960	He is a- do you want to describe your character to her briefly?
4765960	4766960	Please.
4766960	4768960	To the extent that I understand it.
4768960	4769960	Thank you.
4769960	4772960	Dr. Friend, and I don't really.
4772960	4775960	Dr. Friend is a part of the gang.
4775960	4782960	He is a medical man, but he's a medical man who is disturbed and he has a past.
4782960	4783960	Okay.
4783960	4784960	But no one really knows what that is.
4784960	4785960	Okay.
4785960	4792960	And among the things that he's done in the course of this is he has powers that he can
4792960	4796960	use on people like- no, no, wait a minute.
4796960	4797960	I'll tell you in a second.
4797960	4798960	Oh my God.
4798960	4799960	If there's files, I want to file.
4799960	4804960	He does things like he can do healing powers.
4804960	4805960	Healing.
4805960	4810960	So in the course of one of our adventures, if we get hurt, if somebody gets hurt and
4810960	4811960	is dying, I can do that.
4811960	4813960	You have a healing power, yeah.
4813960	4814960	Right.
4814960	4817960	And everybody has powers of some kind.
4817960	4818960	Okay.
4818960	4823760	Yeah, it's kind of like a magical world, Padgett, but it's also the future, so it's technological,
4823760	4826960	but there's also spells and magic, so it's like the future.
4826960	4828960	And a lot of criminal activity.
4828960	4829960	Okay.
4829960	4830960	And also it's Seattle.
4830960	4833960	I have no files, so I have no powers.
4833960	4836960	Well, tonight is just focused on the mysterious past of Dr. Fred.
4836960	4839960	Padgett, right now, because now this is backstory, so none of us are going to be playing back
4839960	4840960	now.
4840960	4841960	No one is going to be.
4841960	4842960	Oh, okay.
4842960	4843960	You're even playing field with the rest of us.
4843960	4845960	Only Curtis knows what his character is.
4845960	4848960	I'm sorry, I'm very competitive and I want powers and a file.
4848960	4849960	I'm sorry.
4849960	4851960	Padgett, you're allowed to be whoever you want.
4851960	4852960	All your roles will become apparent.
4852960	4854960	It's a special one-off episode.
4854960	4858960	We're exploring the origins of a character.
4858960	4862960	So Spencer, what year is it when we're normally playing Shadowrun?
4862960	4863960	2074.
4863960	4864960	Okay.
4864960	4868960	And how old do we think Dr. Friend is?
4868960	4873960	Oh, he's a good, I don't know, 27.
4873960	4876960	What's 2074 minus 27?
4876960	4877960	Yep.
4877960	4882960	What did somebody say?
4882960	4883960	36.
4883960	4884960	46?
4884960	4885960	2046.
4885960	4895960	Our story begins in 2046 A.D. at Baltimore General Hospital.
4895960	4907960	Ivy overruns the decrepit building which has not been the same since the fall of the hospital
4907960	4910960	and the healthcare program.
4910960	4916960	Still, patients are served here, but they're never happy to be served.
4916960	4920960	They only have to be.
4920960	4925960	We move through the front doors of the hospital and down the decrepit halls
4925960	4931960	and start to pick up the whales of a woman giving birth.
4931960	4939960	We enter the delivery room, certainly not the most sterile one we've ever seen.
4939960	4945960	That's right.
4945960	4947960	Keep going.
4947960	4948960	Keep going.
4948960	4949960	Breathe.
4949960	4950960	Push.
4950960	4951960	Push.
4951960	4953960	I'm afraid, Mark.
4953960	4954960	Why?
4954960	4958960	I've never done this before, you asshole.
4958960	4960960	Why am I afraid?
4960960	4961960	It's all right.
4961960	4962960	We're in the hospital.
4962960	4964960	People are looking after us.
4964960	4966960	Nothing can go wrong.
4966960	4967960	Come on.
4967960	4969960	Have you heard from my sister?
4969960	4970960	No.
4970960	4971960	No.
4971960	4975960	I've tried to reach her, but there's no answer on her chip phone.
4975960	4980960	She's always so wild, always trying to find a good time,
4980960	4987960	always giving wigs to men she's having casual sexual relationships with.
4987960	4991960	If you hear from Anastasia, just tell her to get here now.
4991960	4992960	I'll try her again.
4992960	4994960	It's all I can do.
4994960	4995960	Dr. Gerber.
4995960	4996960	Dr. Gerber.
4996960	4999960	Anastasia in room one.
4999960	5001960	Anastasia's here.
5001960	5002960	Keep pushing.
5002960	5003960	Dr. Gerber.
5003960	5006960	Dr. Gerber.
5006960	5007960	There was a...
5007960	5008960	No, no.
5008960	5009960	Curtis, this is when you were born.
5009960	5010960	This is 27 years earlier.
5010960	5011960	I'm sorry.
5011960	5012960	Sorry.
5012960	5013960	Totally misunderstood.
5013960	5014960	27 years earlier.
5014960	5015960	I'm in there.
5015960	5016960	27 years earlier.
5016960	5017960	I don't have to worry about...
5017960	5018960	Did I blow it?
5018960	5019960	Okay.
5019960	5020960	Did I blow it?
5020960	5021960	No, no, no.
5021960	5022960	You were right.
5022960	5023960	I was wrong.
5023960	5024960	What?
5024960	5026960	I thought I was still Dr. Friend, and in fact, I'm still someone who knows the pregnant
5026960	5027960	woman giving birth.
5027960	5028960	No, no.
5028960	5029960	I'm the baby.
5029960	5030960	I'm in there.
5030960	5031960	What?
5031960	5032960	I'm in there.
5032960	5033960	He's in here!
5033960	5034960	In there.
5034960	5035960	Do I need a man to play your dad?
5035960	5036960	So now...
5036960	5037960	Dr. Gerber.
5037960	5038960	Dr. Gerber.
5038960	5039960	I am...
5039960	5040960	Oh, my God.
5040960	5041960	Improv can go so...
5041960	5042960	Dr. Gerber.
5042960	5043960	Get in my office.
5043960	5044960	I want to play your dad.
5044960	5045960	Dr. Gerber.
5045960	5046960	Dr. Gerber.
5046960	5047960	I am...
5047960	5048960	Oh, my God.
5048960	5049960	You go so wrong.
5049960	5052320	I want you in my office right now, Dr. Gerber.
5052320	5053320	What's wrong?
5053320	5054320	What have I done?
5054320	5055320	Dr. Gerber.
5055320	5056320	What have you done?
5056320	5057320	What haven't you done?
5057320	5060080	Don't you realize that you're the brother of the person who's the father of the child
5060080	5061080	you're delivering right now?
5061080	5062080	Oh, that's good.
5062080	5063080	It's Anastasia.
5063080	5064080	I'm a drunk intern.
5064080	5065080	Anastasia.
5065080	5066080	I don't get it.
5066080	5067080	Where have you been?
5067080	5068080	I thought you knocked me up.
5068080	5077080	I got a baby that's going to be the brother of that baby.
5078080	5079080	I don't care whose baby it is.
5079080	5082520	All I know is it's going to look a lot like that doctor right there.
5082520	5083520	No, no.
5083520	5084520	Listen to me, Anastasia.
5084520	5085520	Dr. Gerber.
5085520	5088680	Anastasia, what happened to us was a long time ago.
5088680	5089680	But it meant...
5089680	5090680	That's in the history.
5090680	5091680	No.
5091680	5092680	It was like nine months ago.
5092680	5093680	And the last thing...
5093680	5094680	Okay.
5094680	5095680	Calling Dr. Craig Kakowski.
5095680	5098720	We need help in long form improv and stats.
5098720	5099720	Calling Dr. Craig Kakowski.
5099720	5100720	Please.
5100720	5103720	Our long form improv is a critical condition.
5103720	5104720	It's my fault.
5104720	5105720	I don't...
5105720	5106720	Critical condition.
5107360	5108360	Okay.
5108360	5109360	Paging Dr. Kakowski.
5109360	5110360	Dr. Kakowski.
5110360	5113360	Yes, I was playing golf.
5113360	5116360	What can I do?
5116360	5117360	Well, the...
5117360	5118360	Oh, keep this...
5118360	5125360	We've got a patient here in crisis.
5126360	5129360	And I thought I knew what I was doing.
5129360	5130360	Patient in crisis.
5130360	5131360	You guys.
5131360	5132360	You guys.
5132360	5133360	I'm an orderly.
5133360	5134360	You'll never see me again.
5134360	5135360	I'm an orderly.
5135480	5137480	You'll never see me again.
5137480	5144400	I'm interrupting this very focused scene about the origin of a character to let you know
5144400	5150760	that at this point in future sci-fi history, some big shit is happening, Forrest Gump-style
5150760	5153760	on the tele-viewer.
5153760	5155760	Look!
5155760	5161960	They all look to the TV to see a news report about something...
5161960	5162960	Dr. Kakowski.
5163960	5167120	Well, it seems that VITAS is back again.
5167120	5169920	It's swiving the nation faster than ever before.
5169920	5176320	We got babies turned left ways, babies turned down ways, and adults turned back ways.
5176320	5177320	It's an ugly world.
5177320	5179080	You got to not touch anybody.
5179080	5180840	Don't even bother washing your hands.
5180840	5183160	Cut off your hands.
5183160	5184320	Wash the stumps.
5184320	5185640	We're talking VITAS.
5185640	5187320	It's back, baby.
5187320	5189840	I'm out of here.
5189840	5192520	Have you guys made sure that your baby is...
5192520	5196000	Please don't be offended by this, but human?
5196000	5197800	Oh, God.
5197800	5198800	Please.
5198800	5203200	Look, someone take this metal card with a number sketched in it.
5203200	5207320	Officer Gerber, your brother's number is listed there.
5207320	5209320	If you could get in touch with him.
5209320	5210320	You know what?
5210320	5211320	I'll have a look at that number.
5211320	5212320	If I could.
5212320	5213320	Obama?
5214320	5215320	Obama?
5219320	5225320	Look, no one trusts you since the pickle scandal of 2014.
5225320	5226320	Vurpo.
5227320	5230320	Well, I believe that pickle scandal was a little later than that.
5230320	5231320	Yes, it was.
5231320	5232320	Ah-ha!
5232320	5234320	All of these epidural...
5234320	5235320	That's fine.
5235320	5237320	We've got a quality...
5237320	5238320	Here we go.
5238320	5240320	I...
5240320	5242320	I...
5243320	5246320	We've got emergency breech birth.
5246320	5247320	Oh, good God.
5247320	5248320	It's hideous.
5248320	5249320	Something's come out.
5249320	5250320	We don't know what it is.
5250320	5253320	You know, it's an orderly that was just hanging out beneath...
5253320	5255320	Cut his throat.
5256320	5260320	God damn it, I'm a long-form improv doctor.
5260320	5263320	Not an OBGYN.
5263320	5265320	I also don't know if you can save this.
5265320	5269320	Six years later, at the friend household.
5270320	5272320	It's a shame.
5274320	5275320	What's a shame, Mom?
5275320	5277320	That long-form improv.
5279320	5280320	It's a shame.
5281320	5282320	They tried.
5282320	5286320	I've heard you talk about that sometimes, but you never really explain...
5286320	5289320	Because I don't want to talk about all of it, son!
5290320	5291320	Well, even a little bit...
5291320	5294320	Baby, I think he's old enough.
5295320	5302320	He is old enough to hear the story of how Obama came to the hospital.
5303320	5307320	And you slit the throat of a ghost orderly.
5307320	5310320	He is old enough.
5312320	5314320	That has been distilled...
5314320	5315320	Grandson!
5315320	5316320	...into a sentence.
5316320	5317320	Grandson!
5317320	5318320	It's your grandfather.
5318320	5321320	Would you come out on the porch with me a moment?
5321320	5323320	I just wanted to have a talk with you.
5323320	5325320	Sure, sure, Graham.
5325320	5327320	By the way, in the background, cars are flying.
5329320	5331320	That's never gonna goddamn happen.
5331320	5335320	Grandson, I won't be around a hole much longer.
5335320	5337320	Oh, these damned flying cars.
5337320	5340320	When I was a boy, there was no...
5340320	5343320	We had pickles until that horrible scandal came along.
5343320	5346320	I want to tell you this before I pass along, son.
5346320	5350320	I want you to follow in my footsteps and be a doctor.
5350320	5354320	However, you do understand that you're not like other people, boy.
5354320	5356320	What do you mean?
5356320	5359320	Have you ever noticed anything weird happen to you at night
5359320	5362320	when you're laying in bed all alone?
5362320	5364320	Five months earlier.
5366320	5368320	Come on! Come on!
5368320	5370320	Rudy!
5370320	5373320	Here, boy! Here, boy!
5373320	5376320	There's nothing there. There's nothing.
5376320	5379320	You have to be injured. Injured. Injured.
5379320	5381320	Honey, it's time to go to bed.
5381320	5384320	Oh, no, but it's... Look at Rudy.
5384320	5386320	There's something wrong. He got his leg caught in a trap.
5386320	5388320	Honey, Rudy's an old dog.
5388320	5390320	No, he's not.
5390320	5392320	I can heal him.
5392320	5394320	You is too young.
5394320	5396320	What in the...
5396320	5398320	You have the power to heal.
5398320	5400320	What in the world?
5400320	5402320	You have the power to heal.
5402320	5403320	Heal, heal, heal.
5403320	5406320	Honey, go to bed. Everything's fine.
5406320	5407320	Rudy's fine.
5407320	5409320	No, I healed him.
5409320	5410320	Grandson, back to the present.
5410320	5413320	Grandson, remember that time you healed the dog with your mind?
5413320	5414320	Yes.
5414320	5417320	I do remember it, but I thought it was all a dream.
5417320	5420320	It wasn't a dream. We're not all light. That's horseshit.
5424320	5427320	We're real people. We're here right now.
5430320	5432320	I want to make one agreement with you, son.
5432320	5433320	Okay.
5433320	5435320	Grandson, that is.
5436320	5439320	You were contaminated at birth by V-tox,
5439320	5441320	and you're going to suffer some very special skills
5441320	5443320	and some very special detriment.
5443320	5448320	Inside Pappy's chest, his heart beats heavier and heavier.
5448320	5449320	Boom, boom.
5449320	5452320	Oh, oh, I'm dying.
5452320	5454320	Don't heal me, boy. Don't heal me.
5454320	5455320	Let it happen naturally.
5455320	5456320	Boom, boom.
5456320	5458320	Let it... I don't...
5458320	5461320	I see that look on your eyes, Grandson. I see that look.
5461320	5462320	No.
5462320	5463320	Oh!
5463320	5464320	Oh!
5464320	5465320	Cut to...
5465320	5467320	Agony!
5467320	5470320	Agony!
5473320	5475320	A doctor explains V-tox.
5478320	5479320	Completely lethal.
5479320	5483320	It'll kill you in a hundred percent of situations,
5483320	5487320	unless maybe some crazy shit is in your genes
5487320	5489320	like you have troll stuff.
5489320	5490320	I'm a doctor.
5491320	5495320	Cambridge Bells fade up on the scene of
5495320	5497320	friend's grandpa dying,
5497320	5502320	and we dissolve to the now not perfectly manicured lawns
5502320	5505320	of an Ivy League medical school.
5507320	5511320	Crows and ravens are more prominent now
5511320	5515320	than the kegs and date rapes of old.
5520320	5521320	No, it's good.
5521320	5522320	Well, that...
5522320	5525320	There's a couple ways the future will be better.
5528320	5530320	There's more education.
5530320	5531320	Put it into this.
5531320	5534320	Sex ed is no longer about just what diseases you can get.
5534320	5538320	You can actually tell kids before they get horny about consent.
5538320	5542320	Okay, so we zoom in on a medical proscenium
5542320	5547320	and into a medical class.
5548320	5552320	Son, I'm here to show you
5552320	5555320	the medical college you should go to.
5555320	5558320	And so, what do you think?
5565320	5569320	Hey, friend, it's real weird we have to watch these meetings, right?
5569320	5571320	I know. Jeez.
5571320	5574320	I just want my son to pick the best
5574320	5579320	Carthage, Princeton, Harvard, Yale.
5579320	5582320	All right, okay. Thank you, Mrs. Friend.
5582320	5586320	And I think that will put an end to parents' day here at medical school.
5587320	5589320	If that's what you say...
5589320	5592320	Always been... I never approved of it.
5592320	5593320	It feels weird.
5593320	5596320	Now, as we were saying,
5596320	5600320	how does nanotechnology affect the human condition?
5600320	5603320	And what is human after all?
5604320	5608320	Mr. Friend, perhaps you'd be more willing to answer that.
5608320	5613320	Or does your troll nature confuse the issue?
5613320	5614320	The camera...
5614320	5616320	Friend whispers about friend, whispers about friend.
5616320	5617320	Not good enough. Weird.
5617320	5619320	He's a weird guy.
5621320	5623320	The camera pushes through those students
5623320	5627320	and lands on a troll-like Dr. Friend, now 21 years old.
5627320	5630320	From inside his mind a voice speaks.
5631320	5633320	Trust your instinct, Doc.
5637320	5640320	Do you like french fries, Doc?
5642320	5644320	Trust your instinct, Doc.
5647320	5652320	My troll DNA has nothing to do with my work as a doctor.
5652320	5653320	Oh, really?
5653320	5657320	We have ourselves a protégé.
5657320	5658320	Wait, what do you call it?
5659320	5660320	Protégé!
5667320	5669320	I spent the year teaching in France.
5669320	5670320	I'm your protégé.
5670320	5671320	Get out of here, Dan.
5674320	5676320	So, ladies and gentlemen, please,
5676320	5679320	I think this could be a teachable moment here at Hologram,
5679320	5682320	John F. Kennedy Ivy League Medical School
5684320	5686320	for the surgical and nanotechnological arts.
5686320	5691320	Please, do indulge us, the world's first troll surgeon.
5694320	5696320	What do you feel about Helmanson's law
5696320	5700320	regarding the inefficacy of nanotechnological devices
5700320	5701320	in the bloodstream?
5701320	5703320	Inefficacy? Good word.
5705320	5707320	Dana, also, out. This is not English.
5708320	5709320	I'm sorry.
5711320	5713320	And you were right. We were having tea in the hole.
5713320	5715320	Also, you, Mrs. Stevenson.
5715320	5718320	I don't care how much I'm behind on my rent.
5719320	5721320	Professor, do you mean to tell me
5721320	5724320	that you're going to let a troll person get up
5724320	5727320	and tell me about nanotechnology?
5727320	5730320	Yes. You all have to start listening.
5730320	5732320	It's a new world.
5732320	5737320	Trolls are every bit as worthy and acceptable as doctors,
5737320	5739320	as any of the rest of you.
5740320	5742320	And I'm going to prove it.
5742320	5743320	He will.
5743320	5748320	As friend speaks, sweat drips from his armpits
5748320	5752320	in a way that is inhuman and it creates puddles beneath him.
5753320	5755320	Well, perhaps before you advise us on our physiology,
5755320	5758320	you should manage your own. Look at the puddles.
5760320	5761320	But he's not wrong.
5761320	5763320	Look at the puddles!
5763320	5765320	You'll have to work much harder
5765320	5767320	or the world will have to get much worse.
5767320	5768320	Oh, don't worry.
5768320	5769320	Before you're successful.
5769320	5771320	Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,
5771320	5772320	just take it easy.
5772320	5774320	I'll work harder.
5774320	5776320	Can you regret this?
5776320	5779320	As long as you live!
5784320	5787320	The professors, the professors' face begins to melt
5787320	5790320	like butter in a microwave.
5790320	5791320	Dripping to the ground.
5791320	5792320	Agamem.
5792320	5793320	Agamem.
5793320	5794320	Agamem.
5795320	5796320	Agamem.
5796320	5798320	It's beautiful.
5798320	5801320	The blood goes into a signature that says,
5801320	5804320	Dr. Friend.
5804320	5807320	Cut to 2000 something, but it's a courtroom.
5807320	5809320	It's a futuristic courtroom.
5809320	5812320	Dr. Friend is in shackles,
5812320	5815320	facing a hologram of a judge.
5815320	5816320	Dr. Friend.
5816320	5817320	Dr. Friend.
5823320	5827320	Is it in fact your contention
5827320	5832320	that you have the power of the mind
5832320	5836320	at your will as a healing device?
5836320	5842320	I'm reminded, of course, of the story of a child
5842320	5844320	who had a mere human cold,
5844320	5847320	which has been eradicated for some decades.
5847320	5850320	But his parents thought that they could,
5850320	5853320	through Christian science and the word of God,
5853320	5856320	heal this young man and did not give him syrup
5856320	5859320	of Ipecac or Sudafed or whatever,
5859320	5863320	crude inventions they had at that time.
5863320	5865320	Is it possible that you,
5865320	5868320	as a non-human doctor,
5868320	5872320	claimed to understand the human workings
5872320	5876320	that were first profligated by Von Lee and Hawken,
5876320	5877320	his microscope?
5877320	5880320	Your Honor, is there a question for my clients?
5880320	5881320	Yes.
5881320	5883320	The question is.
5883320	5884320	The question is.
5885320	5888320	Prosecutor Sanders, we've asked this many times before.
5888320	5894320	If you could please rephrase your monologues
5894320	5897320	into a single sentence.
5897320	5898320	Objection, Your Honor.
5898320	5899320	And I don't care.
5899320	5900320	I don't think she knew what she was going to say
5900320	5901320	after she said,
5901320	5902320	Prosecutor Sanders.
5905320	5907320	Orderly asshole.
5907320	5908320	Oh, shit.
5911320	5912320	Well, now, Ms. Emily.
5912320	5913320	Hold on.
5913320	5915320	Your objection was about me not knowing
5915320	5918320	what I was going to say in an improvised sketch?
5918320	5920320	Don't take it personally.
5922320	5923320	I'm not.
5923320	5924320	I'm not.
5924320	5926320	I'm just a, I'm just a lawyer
5926320	5927320	as the Latinos would say,
5927320	5930320	Abigado in a three-dimensional situation.
5930320	5932320	But we have added a fourth dimension
5932320	5934320	and a fifth dimension.
5934320	5936320	And I'm reminded of Sophocles who once said,
5936320	5940320	Good Lord, how is a person to defend themselves
5941320	5943320	when they don't know their own enemy?
5943320	5945320	As this courtroom drama is unfolding,
5945320	5948320	a weird green vapor starts filling up the courtroom
5948320	5950320	from underneath the cracks in the doors.
5954320	5955320	Spencer.
5955320	5956320	Yes.
5956320	5957320	Yes, Jeff.
5957320	5959320	Tell them about the gases coming into the room.
5959320	5961320	Oh, it's, there's gas.
5964320	5965320	Thank you, Spencer.
5965320	5967320	As a court stenographer,
5967320	5969320	I'm sorry to weigh in on the record,
5969320	5972320	but something's wrong with the gas
5972320	5974320	coming from the flour.
5975320	5979320	The gas, the gas itself flows from amorphous diaphanous
5979320	5982320	to solid and cooking form.
5982320	5985320	I'm just, I'm typing as fast as I can.
5985320	5987320	I'm just a jury member,
5987320	5988320	but I tell you what,
5988320	5992320	this gas makes me want to say everything I never did.
5992320	5995320	I wish I would have taken a bath
5995320	5998320	and a barrel of flour.
5998320	6001320	I wish I would have hit a man with my car.
6001320	6003320	One by one, people from the back of the courtroom
6003320	6006320	start dropping dead and suffocating from this green vapor
6006320	6007320	and emanating through the room.
6007320	6010320	And while it's happening,
6010320	6012320	because it's such dramatic juxtaposition,
6012320	6015320	Dr. Friend, as if he's not the one making it happen,
6015320	6019320	gives his final argument about himself.
6020320	6023320	I am a troll,
6023320	6026320	but I'm more than just a troll.
6027320	6033320	I'm a troll who cares deeply about all species.
6039320	6040320	You all.
6040320	6041320	Objection, Your Honor,
6041320	6044320	people are interrupting his monologue right now.
6044320	6047320	It's in my head.
6052320	6054320	I was adopted.
6055320	6057320	I just realized,
6059320	6061320	I'm adopted.
6062320	6063320	And you're all,
6063320	6066320	all of you going to regret this day,
6066320	6068320	because I'm going to right now
6068320	6071320	clear the green fog from this room
6071320	6073320	just before you die.
6073320	6077320	And then you're going to see the sort of
6078320	6080320	troll I am.
6080320	6081320	As your lawyer,
6081320	6084320	I would have appreciated being brought in on this strategy.
6085320	6088320	As the green fog clears,
6088320	6092320	there is nothing left but a sea,
6092320	6094320	or galley as they call it.
6094320	6095320	Gallery?
6095320	6096320	What do they call it in the courtroom?
6096320	6097320	Protege.
6097320	6098320	Protege.
6098320	6099320	Protege.
6099320	6100320	Protege?
6100320	6101320	Sabotage.
6101320	6104320	A sea of corpses.
6104320	6105320	Corpses.
6105320	6108320	I'm a lowly court stenographer,
6108320	6111320	but I know from going to college,
6111320	6115320	it's a galley of dead people.
6115320	6119320	Either way, you look at it as a Harvard graduate.
6119320	6120320	You're alive!
6120320	6123320	It's a bit surprising that a troll
6123320	6125320	would surprise me with science.
6129320	6131320	As a tall man or a black man?
6131320	6135320	Well, you know, I'm part of a lot of all qualities,
6135320	6138320	but really the thing is, it's a science!
6138320	6141320	As Dr. Friend slips out the courtroom doors,
6141320	6144320	we crane shot on the conversation between those two characters
6144320	6146320	who are immune to green gas.
6146320	6151320	Cut to Rolling Stone's cue,
6151320	6155320	blares as we cut to the inside of a cyber tavern.
6155320	6159320	Just to clarify, Dr. Friend did not save those people.
6159320	6161320	No, everyone died.
6161320	6163320	Sorry, go ahead.
6164320	6166320	I'll never stop.
6166320	6170320	Please allow me to introduce myself.
6170320	6174320	I'm the overused Rolling Stone's cue.
6174320	6177320	I'm the song that's used every time you...
6177320	6181320	Yeah, it's like $45,000 every time you use it.
6181320	6183320	Because my husband's a composer!
6183320	6185320	The camera pushes down the bar.
6185320	6191320	As visit holograms inform us of the state of the new world,
6191320	6194320	the dragon president has been assassinated.
6194320	6201320	BTL chips are infected with VRL viral nanos.
6201320	6203320	Women are equal.
6205320	6207320	That's the sci-fi pewter.
6207320	6209320	Everything's insane.
6209320	6211320	Everyone has agency.
6211320	6217320	As your new president, Herman Cain...
6221320	6224320	You know, folks once asked me,
6224320	6227320	what would I do if I did not win this election?
6227320	6230320	And I said I would make mayonnaise.
6230320	6232320	Whoo!
6232320	6234320	In fact, I did win the presidency,
6234320	6237320	and I'm still going to make mayonnaise.
6237320	6240320	I am reminded of the movie motion picture officer
6240320	6245320	and a gentleman in which Richard Gere's character's name was Mayo,
6245320	6248320	but his nickname was Mayonnaise.
6248320	6253320	We arrive at a lone doctor's friend,
6253320	6257320	now fully troll, now fully alone.
6257320	6265320	He nurses his in-descript drink through troll lips
6265320	6269320	and mutters to himself dramatically.
6272320	6274320	Do you care to see her?
6274320	6276320	Oh, it's me.
6277320	6282320	I wonder if I'll ever get over the guilt that I feel
6282320	6287320	for not having cured all of those people in the courtroom.
6287320	6290320	Why can't you save me?
6294320	6299320	You're in-descript wounds, aren't you?
6299320	6300320	You know what?
6300320	6302320	The thing is Obamacare, Doc.
6302320	6304320	Obamacare and French fries.
6304320	6305320	Do you like them?
6305320	6308320	You haven't fixed anything.
6308320	6311320	You talking about saving people?
6311320	6317320	The camera swivels to reveal a trench coat-cloaked troll
6317320	6321320	of a different age, nursing his own drink.
6321320	6323320	Pastor, pastor, pastor.
6323320	6328320	He knocks back the glass with the air of an old-school drunk
6328320	6333320	before turning his yellow gaze on his racial compatriot.
6333320	6334320	Foomp!
6334320	6336320	Fuck people.
6336320	6339320	Fuck them all.
6339320	6341320	What do you mean?
6341320	6345320	Well, how many favors have they done you?
6345320	6347320	Did they cure you?
6347320	6349320	Did they give a fuck whether you live or die?
6349320	6351320	Doctor?
6351320	6353320	No, they didn't.
6353320	6358320	My name is Detective Emile Trollinger.
6358320	6362320	Of Emile Trollinger Trollinger Trollinger.
6362320	6366320	It's a German name, but I was originally Jewish.
6366320	6368320	Jewish, Jewish, Jewish.
6368320	6370320	Think about how that feels.
6370320	6372320	Feels, feels.
6372320	6375320	We cut to the moment when he became German and not Jewish.
6375320	6377320	Or not.
6377320	6380320	Why is Ellis Hyland still open?
6380320	6382320	So embarrassing, embarrassing.
6382320	6383320	Why do I have to...
6383320	6386320	Well, we were working on some sort of trap.
6387320	6388320	Shit.
6388320	6389320	Cut back.
6389320	6390320	Shit, shit, shit.
6390320	6391320	Listen.
6391320	6392320	What are you saying to me?
6392320	6397320	I'm saying to you that this world we used to think was a world
6397320	6401320	is the world we thought came after this world.
6401320	6403320	This is hell, my friend.
6403320	6406320	And it's divided into two groups of people.
6406320	6409320	People who give a fuck and people who live to see tomorrow.
6409320	6411320	Give a fuck, see tomorrow.
6411320	6414320	My name is Detective Trollinger.
6414320	6415320	Trollinger, Trollinger, Trollinger.
6415320	6419320	I used to be a cop until I became a fucking troll.
6419320	6421320	A fucking troll, a fucking troll, a fucking troll.
6421320	6428320	Now I organize shadow runs for shadow runners.
6428320	6432320	And if you call or visit text this number,
6432320	6434320	you could get involved in that world.
6434320	6436320	Complicated, complicated, complicated.
6436320	6438320	Visit text is bullshit, I don't get it.
6438320	6439320	Yeah, why wouldn't you just...
6439320	6443320	Those voices you're hearing are what the troll community
6443320	6444320	calls the inner critic.
6444320	6447320	Don't deny me, don't deny me.
6447320	6449320	You know, the thing that...
6449320	6451320	What I like the most is ice cream, Doc.
6451320	6452320	I like to go to Martha's.
6452320	6455320	One of the troll voices is just Obama talking about it.
6455320	6458320	Just do my best.
6458320	6461320	That's our curse.
6461320	6464320	Hey Trollinger, Trollinger, are you going to order something?
6464320	6466320	I'm trying to run a cyber tavern here.
6466320	6468320	Hey, what are you looking at?
6468320	6471320	Where's the horseshoe?
6471320	6474320	I'll take double what I had on the side of the hair.
6474320	6479320	Trollinger, I have worked very hard
6479320	6481320	to achieve something in my life
6481320	6484320	and I've been knocked down every time I stood up.
6484320	6486320	Oh, well you must be the only one.
6486320	6490320	Sound of my eyes rolling so far back,
6490320	6495320	they roll back around and came up from the bottom
6495320	6498320	in our forever owed one rotation.
6498320	6500320	As Trollinger says this,
6500320	6506320	he starts to feel his heart beat harder and harder.
6506320	6509320	Funny thing about troll bodies,
6509320	6517320	they can take a punch but not from God or Hitler.
6517320	6519320	Do me a favor, Doc.
6519320	6521320	Don't save me.
6521320	6523320	Don't save me.
6523320	6525320	This is no life.
6525320	6527320	I won't.
6527320	6528320	No, wait.
6528320	6531320	Maybe you break the rule this time.
6531320	6533320	That goes against my code.
6533320	6534320	I have to save you.
6534320	6537320	I can do no harm.
6537320	6542320	Oh, Hippocratic Oath.
6542320	6545320	Oh my God, Julie, did I hear you say Hippocratic Oath?
6545320	6547320	Hippocratic Oath, right?
6547320	6549320	Oh my God, I love their fun album.
6549320	6552320	My very first album.
6552320	6554320	When I was studying nursing,
6554320	6556320	Hippocratic Oath, bitch.
6556320	6558320	Oh my God, first of all, when you started,
6558320	6563320	I just want to say you always shit on your haircut
6563320	6566320	when you started nursing, but seriously, it was so cute.
6566320	6568320	Oh my God, but it's totally there.
6568320	6569320	Somebody save that man.
6569320	6571320	He's dying over there.
6571320	6573320	There's a man dying in the bar.
6573320	6576320	Back to the present at Hank's Last Stand
6576320	6581320	where Dr. Friend was revealing his past to the gang.
6581320	6583320	We're just being nurses.
6583320	6585320	Fuck.
6586320	6589320	We fucking do shit all day.
6589320	6590320	All day long.
6590320	6594320	So sometimes we fucking hang out and talk about shoes.
6594320	6595320	I need a sound effect.
6595320	6596320	What do you do?
6596320	6597320	Can we save lives?
6597320	6599320	Meanwhile, in the future,
6599320	6602320	In the future,
6602320	6605320	In a goddamn board game, we like save lives.
6605320	6606320	There's something with agony.
6606320	6607320	And save this guy.
6607320	6610320	As the nurses continue talking,
6610320	6613320	we move from the planet into the vacuum of space
6613320	6617320	and slowly to the center of the universe
6617320	6624320	where God and Hitler float in the center of all reality.
6624320	6628320	And they're watching a sitcom about two nurses called...
6628320	6629320	I'm silent.
6629320	6631320	I'm a female. I'm silent.
6633320	6636320	God and Hitler are watching a sitcom called...
6636320	6638320	Hitler's First Person.
6638320	6646320	They live on the Upper East Side,
6646320	6648320	and they have girlfriends, and they're gross.
6648320	6651320	And we're crazy, but not really.
6651320	6654320	Hitler's hand reaches out with a remote.
6654320	6657320	God's closes over the top of it, stopping him.
6657320	6658320	Really?
6658320	6659320	Don't, Hitler.
6660320	6663320	I just have a problem with the way you treat yourself.
6663320	6666320	I feel like he treats himself so badly.
6666320	6667320	Wait, me or him?
6667320	6668320	I know.
6668320	6669320	Me or your husband?
6669320	6671320	Both of you, but you more.
6671320	6672320	Okay, I know.
6672320	6674320	It's spin-off cliffhanger!
6678320	6680320	That has been Harman Town.
6680320	6682320	Craig Kieckowski, everybody.
6685320	6686320	Demos Brown.
6689320	6691320	Erin McGathey, Spencer Crittenden.
6691320	6692320	I'm Jeff Davis.
6692320	6694320	Curtis Armstrong, everybody.
6697320	6698320	Haggitt Brewster.
6703320	6705320	And your mayor, Mr. Dan Harman.
6705320	6707320	And Chris Burrup.
6707320	6708320	And Sarah Hill.
6708320	6712320	And Zach McKeever, who are back there doing all the technical shit every week.
6712320	6715320	Chris and Sarah are doing the live streaming stuff.
6715320	6718320	Earthshine James are laying down the sexy booze on us.
6719320	6722320	Fly-off for hunting God Curtis on the street.
6727320	6729320	I think we did it.
6731320	6732320	Did you get any of that?
6733320	6735320	It's a good show!
