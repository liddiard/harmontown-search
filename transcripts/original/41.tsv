0	21000	I have some very good news for you guys, this is a permanent town, it's now in session.
21000	28000	Won't you join me in welcoming the mayor of Primement Town, Mr. Dan Harmon!
51000	53000	What on earth?
69000	71000	Jesus, Jeff, take it easy.
72000	74000	Take it easy?
74000	84000	For the podcast listeners out there, Dan Harmon emerges from the shadows with no shirt on and a camera on his head.
85000	93000	He has a GoPro camera strapped to his head and a stomach that clearly has been off its diet for the last two weeks.
94000	100000	That is a comment that would hurt the corporeal, Jeff, but I am man-transformed.
101000	108000	I have been on a 20-day tour, I am now in the cradle of American civilization Portland.
108000	125000	I am in the basin, the hot tub, the bath, the belly button, the voodoo donuts of the United States.
126000	129000	Are you going to do the whole show with no shirt and a camera on your head?
130000	133000	I don't know, Jeff, I proudly tell you, I don't know.
133000	141000	Jeff, what do these people do for a living? Are they industrial or do they make art? Are they teachers? It's Portland.
142000	144000	We do what the fuck we want, Jeff.
147000	151000	We are activated humanity.
152000	157000	I truly hope that somebody, at least one person here tonight, has no idea what Harmon Town is.
158000	165000	My favorite is, like I said, the couples who come because their underage son or daughter couldn't come to the show.
166000	168000	They just came to get a community DVD signed.
169000	172000	So it's like two 40-year-old men and women coming up to me after the show and going,
173000	176000	Hi, could you just make it out to Rachel? What the fuck was that?
177000	178000	Look, here's the thing.
179000	180000	She's got no shirt on.
181000	184000	I'm almost certain that's illegal. You're not allowed to come out here with no shirt on.
184000	190000	Yeah, we did get almost arrested in Vegas when I did this, but I think that's because you're not supposed to sink the studio at karaoke.
192000	200000	The reason I'm doing this, Jeff, is because if sitting back in the green room, we're being given all these gifts.
201000	204000	Portland is the San Francisco of the Northwest.
207000	208000	Certainly.
209000	213000	I think that's safe to say. The culture is high. Everyone's practically a lesbian.
215000	218000	And they don't give a shit, and they're friendly about it, too.
219000	224000	People that aren't lesbians are still just welding shit and calling it art.
227000	230000	There's a mental and cultural health here, Jeff.
231000	236000	If there is a place that we're going to call harm in town that is earthbound, it would be here.
237000	238000	I apologize.
239000	244000	I apologize to our friends back home in Los Angeles.
245000	249000	I apologize to our friends we're going to talk to in San Francisco. You know I love San Francisco, too.
250000	261000	But here's the thing. We came in here. There's people showering us with someone made Spencer special copper dice out of garbage or something.
262000	266000	Someone made us all t-shirts. By the way, this might be a good time to give me my shirt.
267000	269000	No, Dan, do the whole show like that.
270000	272000	I need to be miked and stuff. It's not...
273000	278000	I wanted to participate in their fucking artistic abandon. I want to be a Portland-ier.
279000	284000	Somebody made me this pin. It's just a pin with a tie on it, which I love. Paul? Are you out there, Paul?
285000	287000	Thank you, Paul and Noel. Thank you.
288000	291000	And somebody made me a tie with Adidas stripes on the tie.
292000	298000	And then on the back of the... Because this is Nike Town. I got a Sharpie shirt. Someone made this. Someone made Spencer his shirt.
299000	306000	There was a guy... Portland's version of the obnoxious guy that tries to zig when he shoots zag.
307000	313000	Any other city, there's always a guy that's like, well, fuck this. I'm not going to be a fan. I'm going to impress the hell out of this guy by telling him to go fuck himself.
314000	323000	The Portland's version of that guy printed up political literature about getting me recalled as mayor of Harman Town.
324000	333000	It's filled with material. It's so dense. I couldn't finish reading it all on the thing. There was flyers. I think his name was Kyle. He had me sign a petition.
335000	338000	About me? Mine said Jeff Davis. Suit and tie?
338000	347000	Yeah. That's how heightened things are here because it's the... I don't know. It's the ocean air. It's the yogurt. What do they do here?
348000	352000	They keep it weird here. Portland is fantastically weird and groovy on its own, right?
353000	360000	They keep it practical. They ask the question, why are we doing this, society? And if the answer is I don't know, they fucking drop it like a goddamn hot potato.
361000	364000	Why can't you park here? Fuck it. We can.
366000	371000	Who should I have sex with tonight? I like Ted, but also David. See, fuck it. I'm a lesbian.
373000	378000	I'm going to make love to a woman like she has never been made love to before, and I'm going to run a local brewery.
380000	388000	And I'm going to be cool to straight guys because they're not a threat either. Everything's fine. Let's all just hang out, play board games.
391000	397000	And fly kites and just run around. Portland, I'm on fire here.
399000	402000	You're the show. Please, what can I do for you?
405000	411000	I heard dance take your shirt back off. God damn it, the more I heard about you, the more I love you.
412000	419000	Don't choke up on the bat. Take that shirt back off, man. Or take your shirt off and put your pants on as a shirt.
420000	426000	Yeah, come on. We've been on the tour bus. If I take my pants off, it's going to get uncomfortably clinical.
427000	429000	In terms of laundry.
431000	437000	Rick, rap. Rick, rap. Portland. Portland rap. Gonna rap about Portland. Portland rap.
438000	442000	Bayside, it's a place in the northwest. I fucked your mama in her crotch, in her chest.
443000	448000	Came on her titties and said, that's enough. I fucked your mama so hard, she was like a box of snuff in old-time Europe.
449000	454000	George Washington, I fucked your mama so hard, she was an astonished son.
455000	460000	Crossed the Delaware, fucked your mama's underwear, fucked your mama, fucked your mama in her pussy. Portland.
462000	472000	Whatever. Now, thank you. You're very kind. You're good people. You're wonderful people. Terrible rap.
473000	476000	Tired of it, Jeff. Transformation is what's going to happen tonight.
476000	484000	I came out nearly naked because Portland, in our story circle, if I haven't already transformed, then this whole tour has been for nothing.
485000	492000	You've heard me talking about, oh, we must be dying here tonight. We must be resurrected here tonight. Portland is like the second to last stop.
493000	497000	San Francisco's a gimme, whatever. San Francisco. Fuck those guys.
498000	499000	It's the Portland of California.
499000	511000	Yeah. That's just nothing. That's practically, we could run to Los Angeles from San Francisco if they start booing and we'll be home before they can catch us.
512000	513000	It's a long run.
514000	523000	This is the place where, we're across the return threshold, if I have transformed as a human being, then we're going to see evidence of that tonight.
524000	531000	If I am no longer a caterpillar, tonight is where we see my wings. So I came out with my shirt off because I got nothing.
532000	538000	I don't think I've been on a journey. What do you feel like you should transform into? I have an idea.
539000	547000	I've been fighting the whole cult religious thing forever because who would trust me? But then it dawned on me today.
548000	556000	I was in the back, I was talking in the green room to Morgan, our road manager, whose relatives are in Portland. He had dinner with his brothers.
557000	563000	How's your family, Morgan? My parents couldn't make it. My dad's meds, blah, blah, blah. What's wrong with your dad? His dad's got bone cancer.
564000	566000	Worst of the cancers. And cancer's the worst of the diseases.
567000	569000	It's the Portland of diseases.
570000	574000	No, I mean, meaning is the best.
577000	588000	What Jeff means is that in the monsters incorporated of disease world, cancer is like high fives people on the way to its job of making people miserable in normal world.
589000	593000	So he's right. Cancer rides a bike and has a Zach Galifianakis beard.
594000	604000	Cancer is the Billy Crystal of diseases in disease world, which is weird because Billy Crystal is the cancer of people in normal world.
605000	607000	I just got that.
611000	615000	Thank God. You can't wear a camera on your head the whole time.
615000	624000	It constricts your head and like it's so all right. So what? So I would say, oh, Morgan, that's terrible. Bone, bone, bone. I heard that's the worst of them.
625000	633000	Well, pancreatic's the worst, but it's fast, isn't it? No. Okay. All right. All right. I don't want to get a cancer.
634000	642000	Well, I do want to get a cancer debate. That's fine. I'm not shrugging that off. We can talk about cancer. But but but but sir, at least admit this much. It's bad to have bone cancer.
642000	657000	Okay. Got it. Okay. That that that's what I was in the green room having that conversation. And it's like, like, our tour manager's dad of boom. And I just expressed it as I was like, what, what, what, what is God doing? What is his end game? What's his problem? Like, what's this guy's deal?
658000	667000	And, and, and Morgan's like, what do you mean? It was like, well, what's he, what's he, what's he, what's he doing? What's he doing to us? And Morgan said, yeah, he definitely needs a hobby about God.
668000	679000	God needs a hobby. God needs a hobby. He's too focused. Then it dawned on me. Then it dawned on me. Hobby, Dungeons and Dragons. Spencer is God.
681000	683000	I would go for that for sure.
684000	697000	That's an acceptable religion. Like if I if I started to Elrond Hubbard into a kind of like Philip Seymour Hoffman master kind of like like Tom Cruise Magnolia kind of like vibe where I was like, this is how you feel.
698000	716000	Like everyone would go. It's funny if it's a joke and he's fat, he's stupid, fired from companions of care. But if we started to worship Spencer, it would never get abused. And also God needs a hobby. If that hobby was Dungeons and Dragons, all of life's rules would be consistent.
717000	743000	All of the randomness would be die rolls and all we would all have character sheets and everything we could all level up consistently or die and be resurrected as other things like it's all it all works. And I think that based on his freestyle rapping, like Spencer may be actually God like he he could be like, like God on earth like and the it makes sense to think about everything you know about Spencer.
744000	756000	Our Dungeon Master. Right. He he appeared out of nowhere. We don't know anything about him. He raised his hand in the audience. I said, do we need a Dungeon Master? And he went, I'm a Dungeon Master.
757000	772000	And he came that night, not knowing that you're going to say that, but he came with the idea. I have to drive from Simi Valley to Hollywood, which someone needs a Dungeon Master because I want to play D&D with Dan Harmon. He came that night and you asked him to come up.
773000	783000	Listen to the podcast. It's recorded where he just appears out of nowhere. He goes, I'm a Dungeon Master. He wears shorts in the snow. He wears shorts in the snow. That's another God like quality.
784000	796000	He's the best freestyle rapper ever. He can rap about dinosaurs. He can rap about he's very bashful. He's a shy guy. However, he's the most unflappable person on stage. You can't you can't tamper with Spencer.
796000	807000	He has a and this is where it gets kind of Christ like where it's like half God half man or Hercules. If you're offended by the Christianity thing, it's like, doesn't matter. The idea of half man half God has existed forever. Google it.
809000	825000	He he he is he is he he's he's he's relatable because he's a he you can access him, but he's yeah, he's incorruptible at the same time. He's separate from us like like we talk about love. He's like, I love love is for.
826000	841000	People. I'm not a people. He kind of he kind of disagrees with everything. You take him to a bar and he goes like, I've been to four bars. It's not really working. And he went off to a garden somewhere. Let's bring him out. Let's bring God out.
841000	851000	Yeah, that's a premise like Toby Keith with.
851000	866000	All right. Well, I'm proud to have Spencer as my Lord and God stars and Mars and America's and dice rolling hard.
866000	878000	Well, when those chicken sheites come a terrorist, Izing me. I'm going to refer him to Spencer and have him get a critical hit for me.
878000	888000	He's got a beard and he's not on a cloud. He's down here playing D&D. Spencer is my God, America, you and me.
889000	898000	So it's not a good song, but too much, too much.
898000	907000	I like it. He likes it. He likes it. Am I on? Yeah, it sounds sounds good. How's it going, guys?
907000	925000	Hey, hey, Spencer, I'm being attacked by a man by Toby Keith by approaching you as a shirt that can only be described as tight and ill fitting.
926000	942000	The blue and black plant screams out trying too hard with a lilting voice and a pin that plugs his Denver based I heart this barbecue and grill, whatever the fuck that place was.
942000	949000	He starts to play a song about a red cup or some shit. That's all. That's all I got.
949000	952000	Yeah.
952000	959000	So again, the references, you know, not my forte. Can we can we get our mics up a little bit or at least in the monitor, please?
959000	969000	Sound guy. Check one, two. Shit. There we go. Yeah. Portland. Nice city. What's up with their mics?
969000	978000	We like everything else, but mics are a little cold. I can't really see anybody except people in the front row. Have you been to Portland before?
978000	983000	Yeah, I've been to Portland. I spoke at this thing, this XOXO festival.
983000	991000	Whoo. It was like six months ago. I came here. I hung out with Adam Savage from Myth Busters. Oh shit.
991000	1000000	Damn. I ate a sandwich with him. Very lukewarm applause for Adam Savage. More important than that, did someone boo him?
1000000	1005000	Can you imagine somebody coming? God, bust too many myths.
1005000	1011000	No, he doesn't. Jamie Heinemann busts the myths. Adam Savage is fucking hanging on for dear life.
1011000	1015000	Yeah, that's what it is. Jamie's doing all the fucking heavy lifting on that show.
1015000	1022000	I am actively endeavoring to bust the myth of our lack of friendship between me and Adam. I told him as much. I'm sure he never gets that.
1022000	1031000	Are you guys pals? I'm trying to make it happen. Are you a fan of that show? Well, I saw like six episodes of it a long time ago. Yeah.
1031000	1042000	Are they still doing them? Yeah. Jesus. I think that show busts the myth that they're funny because they keep doing sketch comedy and it's the worst.
1042000	1051000	Please stop asking those fuckers to do sketch comedy. Just tell me the facts. Bust a myth. Don't do sketch comedy. Don't dress up like ninjas.
1052000	1068000	Who's the 20 fucking guy that always hurts himself? Tori. What a cunt. He's like, yeah, I'm a ninja. Just fucking just build something and don't be a dick and fucking get on with it.
1068000	1077000	All right. Well, all right. Yeah. Toby Keith. Jimmy Buffett. Tori from fucking Mythbusters. Good. Fuck him.
1077000	1088000	Jeff. Yeah. We are in the Nike capital of the country. Nike? Fuck Nike.
1088000	1101000	Does anybody work at Nike? Do you guys know because Nike is it's just it's just an office and it just like there's a P.O. box and you have to like you have to be a 14 year old girl from Kuala Lumpur to work at Nike.
1102000	1118000	But you can become CEO. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There's no glass ceiling. Yeah. Well, I thought that we were trying to sponsor our show by with Nike. We gave Nike a chance and they dropped the ball.
1118000	1129000	We tried to kettle one. What the hell is going on? No, they're just ordering nothing. There's ordering, ordering, ordering us to be distracted.
1129000	1147000	What do you what are you looking on your phone right now for? I wanted to check and see if you get a text. What's going on? No, no, no. I just wanted to make sure I didn't I didn't make any notes and I sure didn't. I don't know. Nope. Just hanging out in Portland. Hope this gets better.
1147000	1157000	I had to say Portland without a doubt is one of my favorite cities I've ever been to in the world. Portland is the fucking gravy.
1157000	1169000	Very strangely, you guys take food very seriously here. But even like even simple things like like a little like a grilled cheese is better here for some reason. You guys like speaking of.
1169000	1180000	Oh, yeah, we're not drinking kettle one tonight. Wait, if we go through a city that has their own local vodka and it's decent. We're drinking house spirits. It's a Volstead vodka, right? Yeah. I don't know.
1180000	1193000	Named after the act that prohibited alcohol for for what? 15 years. How long? How long was the prohibition? 20 years? 15? 20 till what? 33? 13 years.
1194000	1211000	Sports corner. Everybody keep clapping until I find the music for it. Oh, my God. I don't know where it's at. Oh, my God. Sports corner.
1211000	1225000	He loves sports. I know you do, too, because your harm in town fans. If anything says sports, it says harm in town. Nike brought to you by Nike. Nike. We're racist. Go fuck yourself.
1225000	1237000	Hey, Dan, how about those Blazers this year? What do you think? Oh, my God. Finally. Finally. Yeah. Well, you can hear it in the crowd. Like the Blazers have really turned it around.
1238000	1253000	What do you think they came from and where are they headed? What direction are the Blazers? I mean, I like to think they come from Portland, but I make no assumptions. I mean, you know, the free agent system being what it is, the new drafts, the second drafts, the third drafts.
1253000	1270000	You know, you get you don't go into regionals with the team you want. You get the team that you get. And I think coach, coach, coach, coach, North Fork is as he knows how to pick the winners at the beginning of the draftable season.
1270000	1277000	Do you think it was a stake to bring Steve Nash in after the injury? Steve Nash's injury was to me largely cosmetic.
1278000	1303000	It's no big deal. We're just summoning a giant moth. It's she protects us. It's going to seem like a monster. But when Godzilla gets here, you'll be thankful. Dan, I know this is a hot button topic for you, especially because you love soccer so much.
1304000	1326000	Timbers versus the Sounders. The Cascadia Cup is coming up in a couple of days. I've always said just like Timbers, Sounders, Jeff, I say merge them together, put them into like a timber sounder like like like, but until the until the league league allows us to do that.
1326000	1344000	I mean, the Timbers are Timbers are an offensive team and the Sounders are defensive. That's always been the way it is since since the 40s going through Jacobson and all the way to land graph and Greenblatt and all the all those coaches like swarms.
1344000	1351000	The only the only Jewish soccer coach and MLS history. He had I mean, his famous this is a team speech.
1351000	1369000	I know you're a big Greenblatt factor. Can you give us some of the Jewish coach? I mean, who can forget him saying, you know, like, like, like, this is a way to kick a ball. This is a way to kick a ball. And, you know, you don't throw, you don't write.
1370000	1376000	Just a smidge of offense is always the best defense. But what do I know?
1377000	1391000	All right, Dan, next season, coin toss. Who do you like ducks or beavers? I'm telling you, telling you beavers for sure. Only for only one reason. You've got you've got a front line. That's amazing. They're always there ahead of the back line.
1392000	1408000	They they know how to charge forward and gain that valuable footage and yardage and just stack it. I guess they keep the knees iced. They keep the they keep the defense on the point and they flank correctly.
1408000	1428000	I've never I can't tell you how many of that sports particular teams of the two schools. Do you like the schools of thought regarding the sport that we're talking about? I mean, like, which university do you like the most between ducks and beavers? I think that that that that you're saying which I'm just asking you to name one of the schools.
1429000	1442000	University of Portland. I think you pee. You pee. You pee. They've got it tied up in a ribbon. Okay. Sports corner with Dan Herman.
1449000	1457000	Something happened after the mantra attack. Like we're ringing out now. I kicked a chord and all hell broke loose. I kicked a chord.
1458000	1459000	And I liked it.
1461000	1473000	Who's in pain tonight? Like, don't say I have pancreatic cancer. No, that's fine. If you have from a hairpin turned apart. I know why I would adjust. I like don't come up and be a pancreatic cancer. We don't want your bullshit up here.
1474000	1485000	Who's it? Who's a transitional emotional? You're moving tomorrow. I hand went back up there. What's it's hard for me to see from up here. Yeah. Is it a gal? What's your name?
1485000	1514000	Alma get up here. Alma everybody. If you want to if you want to come up. I learned in I learned in either Madison or Minneapolis. I can't remember which that we got to remember to say would you like to come up here so that if they're assholes you get to ask them why did you come up here? I made the mistake of I got in the habit of like get up here and then a guy was like hey I'm an asshole and I was like why are you being an asshole? He's like you told me to come up here.
1515000	1544000	I didn't have a. Alma. Hello. Hello. So you're in a transition in your life? I am. What kind? In fact. Well I just started a new job recently. Can you give us details? I work at a bakery. I'm a baker. That's your new job? Had to be a. It's not that awesome bakery with the windows where you can look in. I walked past one from my. Were you on Alberta? I don't know.
1544000	1567000	I should have more information for you. There are there are a lot of bakeries that do that. I do have a fishbowl at my bake. You can smell. I can smell cookies everywhere. It's like why is it cooking? There's it's midnight and then I walked past this place and I looked in the window and there was this bread loaves of bread going everywhere like little trolley cars and that doesn't sound like my bakery. Unfortunately, it sounds fantastic and yours. The bread just sits there like a.
1567000	1596000	In a big pot. Well, I mean, it's it's well, it's well displayed. I work in the public because we're like hearing in. It's displayed. It's just and I sell pastries. Lots of pastries. So that's your new job. It's the new job. I just started it in in December and your old job was I worked at a food cart where I made grilled cheese sandwiches, but that job ended back in June. Right. So it's been a long. It's it's also so so really it was the pain was about the trip. The.
1597000	1626000	Period of unemployment. Yes. Did you collect unemployment? No. Did you know that you can. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. It's it's the way that I became unemployed. It's causing me it's physical pain as well. I was injured. Injured. Like at a food cart? No. Regrettably. What? That would have been more. Oh, you get you get injured off duty. Yeah. Well, what happened? I got hit by cement lamppost.
1626000	1653000	Is that is that is that your revisionist way of saying you walked into a lamppost? Because those don't tend to move around a lot. I got stabbed by a lamppost seven times. A fire hydrant kicked my foot. You mean you're a holocaust. That's what you mean. I mean, I'm a lamppost are fucking vicious. I got attacked. No, explain what happened. So.
1653000	1674000	I was at a park on the 4th of July and some friends of mine were there and they had a slack line. Do you know what slack lining is? No, no, no use it. I do. But explain to them. All right. So it's kind of. I think that's 40 bucks downtown, right? So it's somebody poops in your chest. It's okay. I mean, if you want.
1674000	1681000	What is what is slack lining?
1681000	1703000	Slack lining is so you've got a nylon rope, similar what we'd use to like for climbing. And you set it up between two things. And in this case, we're setting up really low to the ground. So no higher than this. Okay. Knee level. Knee level. Okay. Yeah. And so we were at a park and we're like, hey, let's play with the slack line. So okay, we'll set it up. And the two trees that we picked are too far apart. So somebody else said, hey, lamppost. Let's try that.
1703000	1732000	But wait, I have to stop you because I what are you what are you doing with the oh, sorry, sorry, then you walk across a tightrope walker instead of tight. It's slack line. Oh, wait, wait. So it's like an entertainment thing, like a like a performance, like you walk across the you do a tightrope act with. Well, in this case, we're just fucking around. So well, no, I mean, yes, you could do it for entertainment. There's a movie. The name of which I can't remember that subtitle is Flight of the Frenchies and they're doing something similar, but that's way more extreme.
1732000	1761000	Man on wire. Man on wire. Well, I don't think that's the subtitle flight of the Frenchies on man on the wire. Maybe not. It's a you're doing a tightrope act. You're fucking around, which is entertainment, whatever. Okay, we're all on the same page. Okay, so so the the idea is that you have to have a little bit of attention on the line or you can't walk on it. It's useless. So there's a little bit of attention on the line. And I'm standing so if this is the tree, that's the lamppost. I'm standing right about here. And the lamp just set up. And we're just figuring out if it's tight enough to walk.
1762000	1786000	And one way I put his foot on and it gets right off because something is wrong. And I'm looking at him over here. And you're kind of where my boyfriend is standing. He's gonna like, he shouts my name. I turn and I look and the lamppost is right. What the hell? You found one of Portland's many scandalous fake lamppost that they had stopped to get all that, you know, nearly blind grant money.
1787000	1803000	There was like, there was like, there was like, they found like a bunch of like, in the 70s to the 90s, like New York had like a whole shitload of fake fire hydrants that they that they just put that did not have water underneath them. It was that had to do with like city funding or something. Anyways, look it up.
1804000	1813000	I'm one of those guys because I read this, but I think you'll look it up and it's all bullshit. But anyways, a concrete lamppost comes crashing down on you. And where did they hit you?
1813000	1842000	And where did they hit you? It hit me right here. On your head. And then it hit me right here. A lamppost is like a million. Yeah, it's enormous. And it has a lamp. It's everything. So here's what happened. The lamp hit me here and then gave me a nice little laceration right up here. On her head. She's pointing to her head. It's a podcast. I'm sorry. She's pointing at her head. She's pointing at her head. Right in the middle, like right on the top of my scalp. It's like an inch long or so. They had to close that with staples. But then you went home and you explained to your mom.
1843000	1872000	And she's like, what were you doing? I called my dad from the hospital. He's like, what? You were, were you fixing a lamppost? No, dad. I was slack roping. And I wasn't even on the line. Like that's the really distressing thing. Like I was just standing there. Are you, uh, is there any like hangover from that? Is there any like lasting injury to that? Yeah, I'm still, that's where the pain's coming from. I have a mid foot sprain that is yet to heal. Like I had a broken ankle and stitches and surgery and nonsense.
1873000	1895000	And bad things and like six months on it. None of this is covered by insurance. I assume I would not. If I was an insurance company, I would say you, you, you, you, you tether a lamppost and pull them down as part of your ad hoc clown act at your own peril. When that goes wrong, it's course majeure as far as we're concerned here at all state.
1896000	1898000	That is also what the city said.
1899000	1905000	But simultaneously thinking only in Portland, coolest city in the world. Like people should do that more often.
1906000	1913000	And you totally should. This is not a cautionary tale. Do go slack lining. Don't use a lamppost, but do go slack lining because it's a lot of fun.
1913000	1921000	I would have thought those things were like deep into the ground. Like that there was a whole high thing that like, no, no, no.
1922000	1937000	They're designed to pop right off if you hit him in a car. Oh, so it's a grand theft auto. Yeah, that's interesting. Wait, they're designed to break. Yeah. Like if you hit a tree, tree stays put. If you hit a lamppost, lamppost gone.
1939000	1942000	But I guess the trade off is that you're that's our first commandment.
1942000	1950000	We're slowly going to compile a religion here.
1953000	1960000	God talks like a caveman. Yeah. Time. Listen up.
1960000	1964000	Killing people bad. Don't be a dick. Fuck off.
1965000	1972000	All right. So and so because you sustained that injury, the food cart that you worked for was like, go fuck yourself.
1972000	1982000	Like I had recently left them and I had like a two or three week period plan where I was going to like take like a week or two off in the summertime, have fun and then go to work at a different food cart.
1982000	1988000	And in between is that's when the accident happened. Oh, and so I'm still still, you know, like that.
1988000	1992000	And now you're just looking at bread go by on a conveyor about thinking about what you used to be.
1994000	2000000	It's actually not that like right now I'm just getting to like the happy part. We're on the upswing now. I'm finally I have a degree in baking.
2000000	2011000	So baking is what I want to do. It's what I love to do. So you're not in a transition. I am because my foot prevents me. My injury prevents me from like doing more like I can't do.
2011000	2016000	I'm working two days a week right now with the third training day and I can't do any more than that.
2016000	2021000	You're adjusting to life as someone who's not allowed to slackline. I'm adjusting. Yes. Right.
2021000	2027000	Okay. Well, that's Alma. All right. Let's have a hand for Alma for sharing her pain. Alma.
2030000	2037000	Is there just one more question. Like if there's anything that you could do is it doesn't it doesn't stop at slacklining, right?
2037000	2040000	Like what would you do if you could do anything?
2040000	2055000	Everything. Oh, all right. Inspiring but boring. That's fine. It's a fine healthy answer. I guess that would be mine too.
2055000	2061000	Long fucking walk. I go for a bike ride. All right. Alma, the slackliner who would do everything.
2062000	2071000	All right. We're gonna Alma. We're gonna do your you can you can you can go eat some pita bread and we're going to
2074000	2081000	we're gonna we're gonna do a movie for Alma. Okay. But now having having some success with this. I want to do like Alma's like life story.
2081000	2087000	I guess it's it's it's called slackliner slackliner.
2092000	2100000	Alma? Honey, it's time to get up. Dad. Alma, come on. It's time to get up. Breakfast is ready, Alma.
2100000	2112000	Dad, I was dreaming. Dreaming about what? More of that slackline? Door comes down. Listen, you come from a long line of tightliners.
2113000	2126000	We keep our lines taut. If I find you walking on a line that is not taut, what have I told you about non-taut lines? What have I always told you? You don't.
2126000	2138000	You're gonna break an ankle doing that shit. Yes. But you had a saying about it too. I'm gonna go I'm gonna go back to work at the at the lamp post factory.
2139000	2148000	He just doesn't get me. All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna do my last day of work at the food truck.
2148000	2169000	Alma? Yes. You're fired. But I've been. No, you're fired. You guys keep moving the truck. I can't thank you. It's called the food truck. If it didn't have wheels, we'd call it a restaurant. This thing has wheels on it.
2169000	2188000	Also, I found out yesterday that you served some cheese that wasn't grilled. When I told you about grilling cheese, it must be grilled. Or, or you're breaking ankle. You're cruising for a bruiser, Alma. You're fired. You're just like my dad. Fuck you.
2189000	2204000	Stupid truck. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna get a job at a place that is almost identical to a food truck, but that without the truck part. Oh, wait, look at this giant loaf of bread rotating around the building.
2204000	2213000	Welcome to my bakery. Would you like a job? Hey, yes.
2214000	2222000	Fair enough. My name is Alma. Alma what? Alma bitches.

2254000	2281000	Later that night. Hey, Alma, how's it going? Whoa, hey Sasquatch. It's Yeti. Anyway, that's cool, man. It's Portland fucking do it. Yeah, if I had a dollar for every one of my friends, it was named after the mythical abominable. Hey, look, man. Alma, I know that you come from a long line of top liners, but me and my friend, we're gonna go fucking slack landed later on. It's not for me.
2281000	2305000	It's not for me. Everyone's doing it. The line is less taught Sasquatch. No, we're gonna tie off to the we're gonna your father worked at the lamppost mill that we know that those are going to be sound and also a tight liner. I know. But that's that we're gonna slack line on it, man. It's less taught. There's less tension there, man. I mean, girl thought balloon. My dad is a tight liner and he makes a lamppost.

2381000	2390000	The monkey and the Sasquatch and the bread. Everything's the same.
2391000	2409000	Wake up. It's your father. Dad. Hi, you were having a door goes down. You were having a terrible dream. Were you dreaming about doing anything other than what you're supposed to do by following the rules? No, never, ever, ever follow your dreams.

3053000	3081000	These fucking kids are shitty rappers. I hate this sandwich. I hate your fucking, I looked in the magazine. I took a quiz and said, if you go to a woman's house and she has decapitated heads and one of his banana would try to hit her and that's how you fall over there, then it's going to be shit and I didn't listen to it. And I fucking regret this. I regret this shit. I regret working with you. I regret handing you that paper. I regret all the chances I took on you.
3081000	3082000	But I loved you.

3086000	3088000	I loved you so much.
3090000	3092000	And everything is so important.
3093000	3094000	Everything in life.
3094000	3095000	Everything is so important.
3095000	3096000	Everything in life.
3097000	3098000	Everything is important.
3098000	3099000	Everything comes down to that one moment.
3099000	3101000	Everything is important.
3104000	3109000	From the trees, to the bushes, to the round.
3113000	3117000	Everything, everything is important.
3117000	3118000	What?
3126000	3127000	Sasquatch comes in.
3134000	3137000	A long crawl about statistics of Sasquatch rape.
3139000	3143000	There are 75,000 instances of Sasquatch rape in the northwest.
3144000	3146000	Most people don't report it.
3147000	3148000	And those don't do.
3149000	3150000	The Library of Congress.
3151000	3152000	All right, Megan, everybody.
3157000	3159000	I guess we got to know Portland a little better.
3160000	3161000	That makes sense.
3161000	3163000	We learned a lot about Portland tonight.
3163000	3164000	I don't know.
3164000	3168000	Makes sense to me, although I'm pretty blown out on, what is this called?
3168000	3169000	Volstead.
3170000	3171000	All right, we should play D&D now.
3171000	3173000	Look at this guy over here.
3174000	3175000	Is it time?
3178000	3182000	You know, a guy came up to me at the bar, Spencer.
3182000	3185000	A guy came up to me and he said, I love your podcast.
3185000	3186000	I have one note.
3186000	3187000	And I was like, here we go.
3188000	3195000	And he said, you should separate the D&D from the podcast and do a whole D&D thing with Spencer and have celebrity guests.
3195000	3197000	And I was like, Andrew, shut up.
3198000	3199000	I did it.
3199000	3200000	I sold that show.
3200000	3201000	We're going to do that on the Web.
3201000	3203000	It's going to be a whole different thing with Spencer.
3203000	3204000	Dungeon Master.
3204000	3205000	Fuck yeah.
3208000	3209000	That's D&D time.
3209000	3211000	And he was like, oh, I already knew that.
3211000	3214000	I just wanted to like, I invented it to talk to you about.
3214000	3217000	And I was like, I ripped off his face and I was like, dad.
3219000	3221000	And he was like, like, like, I'm sorry.
3221000	3222000	Polio.
3223000	3225000	Let's get Aaron McGathey to the stage.
3225000	3227000	Aaron, McGathey, are you out there?
3231000	3232000	All right.
3233000	3235000	What if Aaron came up with his shirt off?
3238000	3239000	I was toying with the idea.
3239000	3243000	I just had I had my tights off with like a target around my pussy.
3245000	3246000	Everybody.
3246000	3251000	Did we go like like Spencer's wearing a T-shirt that says Master of Dungeons.
3251000	3253000	I'm wearing a T-shirt that says Sharpie.
3253000	3254000	I spilled.
3254000	3255000	I had a Rob.
3255000	3258000	Rob's the awesome guy who made all these shirts.
3258000	3259000	Let's hear for Rob.
3259000	3260000	Rob made it.
3262000	3265000	He made me a shirt with two arrows that said adventure.
3265000	3268000	I spilled vodka all over it, but I had it on earlier.
3268000	3270000	Vodka is a terrible stain.
3270000	3275000	But Rob, let me tell you, she spills vodka all over everything she loves.
3276000	3277000	Including vodka.
3277000	3283000	Like her boyfriend, the planet, birth certificates.
3283000	3284000	It's a christening.
3284000	3287000	This guy's got a camera in his head and he went to the bathroom.
3290000	3292000	Did you just film yourself taking a piss?
3293000	3294000	Oh, I.
3295000	3296000	I don't know.
3296000	3297000	All right.
3297000	3298000	There's no red light on it.
3298000	3302000	Is it out of D12 or whatever?
3303000	3304000	Oh, my God.
3304000	3305000	He has blood all over his face.
3306000	3308000	Neil, make sure it's still rolling.
3308000	3311000	And also give him three dollars off his ticket price?
3311000	3312000	Jesus Christ.
3313000	3319000	I also I was told I was told by Morgan, our tour manager, that I need to announce that
3319000	3324000	after the show, we're going to the Lucky Labrador across the street.
3325000	3330000	And that's where that's where Spencer and I will be selling merch and where you can
3330000	3333000	buy prints and T-shirts and Dan and Jeff will sign them.
3333000	3335000	Only fifty dollars a signature.
3335000	3337000	No, no, no, no.
3337000	3339000	Also, I'll sign anything you buy.
3339000	3340000	And also, you don't have to buy anything.
3340000	3341000	I'll sign.
3341000	3342000	I'll sign your napkin.
3342000	3343000	I'll sign.
3343000	3344000	I will for no price.
3344000	3346000	I will mime Sasquatch rape you.
3350000	3353000	Portland, you guys are fucking weird.
3353000	3354000	I love this.
3354000	3358000	Also, Spencer and I have a special kissing booth where you can stand in the middle and
3358000	3359000	we'll kiss your teeth.
3359000	3360000	And watch them kiss.
3360000	3361000	They will kiss each other.
3361000	3364000	All right, Spencer, can we get our character sheets, please?
3364000	3365000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3365000	3366000	Spencer has passed that down.
3366000	3369000	Spencer is now dispensing the character charts.
3369000	3370000	Thank you.
3371000	3372000	Spencer, get us up to date.
3372000	3373000	Would you please in the campaign?
3373000	3379000	When we last met, the party was still trapped in the confines of the Infinifish.
3379000	3383000	After taking out a lung and returning to where Corc had encountered the kidney, the party
3383000	3390000	took on the massive ordinine and the spidery sparks guarding it.
3390000	3394000	The kidney was eventually destroyed and the gang pressed on through a thicket of fleshy
3394000	3398000	cords sliding down a slimy slide to a pink platform.
3398000	3399000	Fuck.
3399000	3404000	At the bottom, they fought a tricky slime in case in which was a book.
3404000	3409000	And after slicing and dicing the bloody slime, Sharpie was able to retrieve said magical
3409000	3410000	toe.
3410000	3414000	The only way out appeared to be a large sphincter on the floor.
3414000	3417000	What would they do?
3417000	3421000	I think I've said this before, but it would be so handy to have Spencer in your day to
3421000	3425000	day life as an alcoholic.
3425000	3429000	You went to the drawing room and started doing shots of Ferdinand Branca.
3429000	3431000	Yes, you left your credit card there.
3431000	3433000	And about 3 p.m.
3433000	3437000	Dino came by and you ended up going to the L.A. zoo.
3437000	3440000	Searching for your wallet, you realize.
3440000	3445000	If you get a text from Margaret, don't answer it.
3445000	3446000	Margaret.
3446000	3447000	Yeah.
3447000	3448000	All right.
3448000	3449000	That's why.
3449000	3454000	I'm going to say, just to start things off with a fun note, I'm going to just stick a
3454000	3458000	foot through that sphincter on the floor and see what goes.
3458000	3460000	Just the one foot?
3460000	3461000	You know what?
3461000	3466000	I'm going to run and I'm going to go like a long jumper.
3466000	3468000	I'm going to go one, two.
3468000	3472000	And then I'm going to put my hands above my head and I'm going to feet first go through
3472000	3473000	the sphincter on the floor.
3473000	3475000	But what are you going to do in D&D?
3475000	3476000	Huh?
3476000	3478000	Nice, nice.
3478000	3480000	Don't you snap.
3480000	3481000	Can we?
3481000	3483000	At what time is it appropriate?
3483000	3485000	I just saw these T-shirts over here.
3485000	3486000	When do we bring those up?
3486000	3487000	In a bit.
3487000	3488000	In a bit.
3488000	3489000	Yes.
3489000	3490000	Sorry.
3490000	3491000	Wow.
3491000	3497000	Dan Herman fucked my mama and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.
3497000	3500000	All my mama got was these lousy herpes.
3500000	3503000	No, they're great herpes.
3503000	3504000	No, they're great.
3504000	3505000	Baby.
3505000	3506000	Babe.
3506000	3507000	They're great herpes.
3507000	3508000	They're weaponized.
3508000	3514000	All right, so I do a one, two, three and I make myself like I go feet first through
3514000	3517000	the sphincter on the floor, Spencer.
3517000	3518000	Bloop.
3518000	3522000	You swiftly slide through the sphincter and find yourself in a small chamber.
3522000	3524000	In front of you is a meat curtain.
3524000	3527000	You sense something powerful and dangerous behind.
3527000	3532000	Oh man, is this going to be like the Indiana Jones thing but it's a turd like rolling?
3532000	3534000	Because you're obviously in a colon, right?
3534000	3535000	That's going to be like a...
3535000	3536000	I don't know.
3536000	3537000	You're running from a round ball.
3537000	3543000	I'm looking at a meat curtain, yeah.
3543000	3546000	So what are my surroundings?
3546000	3548000	You're just in a small area.
3548000	3549000	It's pretty closed off.
3549000	3552000	You just flew through like a giant sphincter.
3552000	3556000	Okay, I do a current wheel and do a round off.
3556000	3562000	And as I round off, I try to round off through the meat curtain so that when I emerge through
3562000	3565000	the other side of the meat curtain, I go like, ta-da!
3566000	3571000	So I do a current wheel and then tuck and then do a round off and I land, I go through
3571000	3572000	the meat curtain.
3572000	3574000	Okay, so cartwheel, tuck, the knees.
3574000	3575000	Yeah.
3575000	3576000	Round off.
3576000	3577000	Right.
3577000	3578000	Meat curtain, ta-da.
3578000	3579000	Right.
3579000	3580000	Okay.
3580000	3583000	I'm upside down doing the tuck as I go through the meat curtain.
3583000	3588000	And ideally, I would round off and be facing whatever I'm facing at the other side of the
3588000	3589000	meat curtain.
3589000	3591000	Well, you attempt that.
3592000	3595000	Your shoulders get stuck in the meat curtain.
3595000	3596000	No!
3597000	3599000	You fall unceremoniously outward.
3600000	3602000	Should have done five more round offs.
3602000	3603000	I fall where?
3603000	3605000	Into a largish room.
3605000	3607000	Oh, so I've gone through the meat curtain.
3607000	3609000	You can see through the meat curtain.
3609000	3611000	I wouldn't say you're entirely through it.
3612000	3614000	But I'm in a largish room.
3614000	3619000	Yeah, and you're also like falling on the ground from failing your cartwheel maneuver.
3619000	3624000	Okay, then I just crawl, like army crawl hand over hand through the meat curtain into
3624000	3625000	the greater room.
3625000	3628000	The room is littered with flabby tubes and arteries.
3628000	3633000	The walls are covered in web-like lattices of veins and strands of fibrous tissues.
3633000	3638000	You can see a large throbbing heart standing in the center of the room.
3638000	3643000	Hanging from the ceiling are two orange orbs of tissue, perhaps some sort of nerve cluster
3643000	3644000	or other thing.
3645000	3649000	Two flabby tubes reminiscent of stalagmites stand up straight nearby the heart.
3649000	3650000	Flabby tubes.
3650000	3653000	He was an actor in all those old John Wayne movies, right?
3653000	3655000	Yeah, now it's terrible what happened to him.
3655000	3657000	The studio system really victimized him.
3657000	3658000	Hey!
3658000	3660000	You're gonna go in that heart, eh?
3660000	3662000	I don't know what's going on in there.
3662000	3663000	What's happening?
3663000	3669000	He has the famous stories that flabby tubes murdered that kid, but it was all, it's not true.
3669000	3670000	No.
3671000	3674000	Walt Disney murdered a kid and blamed it on flabby tubes.
3674000	3678000	I hollered a Sharpie in Mulray and said, hey guys, I think I found the heart and possibly
3678000	3680000	two nerve clusters.
3680000	3681000	Get on in here.
3681000	3683000	Oh, is he coming back up through the sphincter?
3683000	3684000	No, I hollered.
3684000	3686000	Did the sound carry through meat curtains?
3686000	3691000	You hear the faint squelchy sound of Quark's voice coming through the sphincter.
3691000	3696000	Does it sound like he's saying don't come down here, I'm being digested by a sphincter
3696000	3701000	or does it sound like he's maybe saying data in the goonies, hey, I found another room.
3701000	3704000	You hear, it sounds like he mentioned something about a heart.
3704000	3710000	Okay, well, I jumped down through the sphincter.
3710000	3712000	You can jump through the sphincter.
3712000	3716000	You can leave your friends behind, cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
3716000	3718000	they're not friends of mine.
3718000	3720000	Sphincter dance.
3720000	3726000	No, no, no, don't fuck a clap for that shit.
3726000	3728000	Don't reward that.
3728000	3731000	If you don't give a shit about the Goonies reference, then fuck the safety dance.
3731000	3734000	Just let me sit up here and die in front of you.
3734000	3736000	Of old age.
3736000	3738000	Let me turn into Mount Rushmore.
3738000	3740000	No, no, no, don't.
3740000	3745000	Sharpie, you can't just go through the sphincter, you have to cartwheel through the meat curtains
3745000	3747000	and then army crawl through the rest of the meat curtain.
3748000	3752000	I actually want to use that stick that you gave me that has the button on it.
3752000	3756000	I'm going to put the stick through the sphincter, so to speak,
3756000	3760000	and then slide down it like a fireman's pole.
3760000	3762000	Because I pressed the button.
3762000	3765000	Is this because you went to the embers today?
3765000	3767000	Is that why?
3767000	3769000	Embers is awesome, the fish tank bar.
3769000	3774000	We had a big fight, but it's cool that there's fish in the bar.
3774000	3777000	And then inevitably someone's going to go, oh, those fish aren't being taken care of.
3777000	3779000	Like, come on, but they're in a bar.
3779000	3781000	It's a tranny bar, right?
3781000	3783000	Yeah, but the fish don't know that.
3786000	3791000	I don't think anyone was like, oh, these trainers are a bad influence on the fish.
3791000	3794000	They're going to start dressing up as snakes.
3794000	3797000	Yeah, it's a drag queen.
3797000	3799000	They have drag queen shows, yeah.
3799000	3801000	But this was during the day, they're open at like 11.
3801000	3804000	You can go sit there, and it's like beautiful, and they've got a fish tank bar.
3804000	3806000	Embers.
3808000	3809000	I enjoyed it.
3809000	3811000	I didn't want to feel bad for the fish.
3811000	3812000	I thought the fish were...
3812000	3813000	There's goldfish.
3813000	3815000	They're a robust species of fish.
3815000	3816000	Yeah.
3816000	3818000	And the whole bar is a fish tank.
3818000	3823000	That means that the fish are over here, and they could go all the way to the end of the bar.
3823000	3827000	If you were a fish that was burned in a tank...
3827000	3828000	They came from a lake.
3828000	3830000	No, they didn't come from a lake.
3830000	3834000	No one from Embers goes out in a raincoat like a Vandy Camps fisherman,
3834000	3837000	and catches, oh, another goldfish for the bar.
3837000	3842000	They're boring in a goddamn paper cup at a carnival.
3842000	3846000	And the ones that get adopted by the drag queen from Embers are like,
3846000	3850000	they're the luckiest fucking goldfish in Portland.
3850000	3854000	And they pour them in there, and the fish are like, what's happening?
3854000	3856000	And it's like a Pixar movie, like Albert Brooks comes up and goes like,
3856000	3858000	holy shit, you wouldn't believe it.
3858000	3860000	There's a whole bar.
3860000	3864000	And then every once in a while, yeah, someone crashes through the top of the bar
3864000	3867000	because they get angry, and probably a fish gets crushed.
3867000	3868000	All right.
3868000	3872000	But at least there's no turtles eating them.
3872000	3874000	Yeah, at least there's no turtles.
3874000	3877000	All right, so I'm waiting for my friends through the meat curtains.
3877000	3882000	You see a staff poking its head through the sphincter and then the meat curtain.
3882000	3885000	Sharpie!
3885000	3888000	Oh!
3888000	3889000	I recognize that.
3889000	3892000	What's up?
3892000	3893000	This is shitty.
3893000	3896000	I grab onto the end of the staff and pull them through.
3896000	3897000	It's stuck.
3897000	3898000	What?
3898000	3899000	Oh, I'm sorry.
3899000	3901000	Let me press that button.
3901000	3903000	You pull it.
3903000	3906000	You know, Sharpie, are you on it or are you already through at this point?
3906000	3907000	Oh, boy, it's stickler over here.
3907000	3908000	Okay.
3908000	3909000	It's important.
3909000	3911000	All right.
3911000	3912000	Goddamn it.
3912000	3913000	You can just pick one.
3913000	3914000	It's fine.
3914000	3916000	Am I on the pole or what?
3916000	3917000	Yeah.
3917000	3919000	Did you already come through on the pole or is he pulling you through now?
3919000	3921000	I wanted to slide through the sphincter.
3921000	3922000	Yeah.
3922000	3923000	Well, that happens.
3923000	3924000	And then, okay, so you slide through.
3924000	3925000	Hey, whatever.
3925000	3926000	I got mole rain.
3926000	3927000	Press the button and come through.
3927000	3928000	Yeah.
3928000	3929000	Okay.
3929000	3930000	All right.
3930000	3931000	So you slide through.
3931000	3932000	Now you're there.
3932000	3933000	Now you grab the thing.
3933000	3934000	Now it's grabbed.
3934000	3935000	We got the staff through the door.
3935000	3937000	You guys cut it in a cartwheel.
3937000	3939000	I wanted to do something cool.
3939000	3940000	All right.
3940000	3942000	So what are our surroundings now, Spencer?
3942000	3943000	Am I there?
3943000	3944000	You're there now, too.
3944000	3945000	Hey, guys.
3945000	3947000	Hey, good to have you back.
3947000	3949000	So what do we see now?
3949000	3950000	You're in a room.
3950000	3951000	No.
3951000	3952000	So I explained the heart, right?
3952000	3954000	So there's a giant throbbing heart.
3954000	3959000	Hanging from the ceiling are two orbs of orange tissue, perhaps some sort of giant nerve cluster.
3959000	3960000	I said that already.
3960000	3962000	There's the two flabby tubes.
3962000	3966000	They're venting noxious gases in the colors of green and orange.
3966000	3971000	And you can also see a few tentacles waving around nearby the ground.
3972000	3976000	In the center of the room, you can see that ice stalk that you encountered earlier.
3976000	3977000	Shit.
3977000	3980000	And it begins swaying ponderously.
3980000	3989000	Gentlemen, are we trying to destroy the fish, or should we just want to leave the fish, right?
3989000	3991000	Well, I think we have to kill it.
3991000	3992000	Yeah, I would say.
3992000	3996000	But if we kill it, are we going to fall down into nothing?
3996000	3997000	Yeah, but...
3997000	3999000	I used my far sword attack.
3999000	4000000	Here's my plan.
4000000	4009000	While they're fucking mulling shit over, because I'm a barbarian, I swing my far sword as hard as I can at the heart.
4009000	4011000	At the heart itself, right?
4011000	4012000	Yes.
4012000	4013000	Okay.
4013000	4014000	Ah, you miss.
4014000	4015000	Fuck everybody.
4015000	4021000	Your far sword goes wide, and rather than hitting the heart, it instead strikes a tentacle.
4021000	4022000	Is that good?
4022000	4026000	It's better than not hitting anything or hitting yourself in the foot.
4030000	4031000	I remove...
4031000	4033000	You deal seven damage, all right?
4033000	4036000	I remove two...
4036000	4038000	The arrows!
4038000	4039000	The arrows!
4039000	4040000	Oh, she did it!
4040000	4041000	She shaved.
4043000	4048000	And as I'm pulling them out, a sparkle from my eye catches Quark's eye.
4050000	4053000	And I pull back, and I shoot my arrows.
4053000	4054000	At?
4054000	4055000	At adventure!
4055000	4056000	That doesn't...
4056000	4057000	At the heart.
4057000	4058000	At the heart.
4058000	4059000	At the heart.
4060000	4062000	You shoot two arrows at the heart.
4062000	4063000	V-arrows.
4063000	4064000	Spencer, V-arrows.
4064000	4066000	Yeah, V-arrows at the heart.
4066000	4068000	I'm listening.
4068000	4072000	Both of them strike the heart directly in its center of mass.
4072000	4074000	Yay!
4077000	4079000	Sphincter battles!
4079000	4082000	dealing six damage.
4082000	4083000	Yeah.
4083000	4084000	Six.
4084000	4085000	Yeah, six damage.
4085000	4087000	The eyeball sways barbarously.
4088000	4091000	That's some Seattle shit right there.
4092000	4093000	I don't know.
4094000	4097000	I just randomly thought maybe they had a rivalry with Seattle.
4097000	4098000	They do.
4098000	4099000	They do.
4099000	4103000	I was really tired today, and I think for a half an hour, I thought I was literally in Seattle.
4103000	4106000	And I met someone, and they were like, yeah, I'm from like an hour north of Seattle.
4106000	4108000	I was like, all right, so an hour away?
4108000	4109000	You were in Seattle?
4109000	4110000	Portland's way better, though!
4110000	4111000	It was Eddie Vedder.
4111000	4113000	You know it was Eddie Vedder.
4113000	4114000	Wow.
4114000	4116000	I thought he had something in his mouth.
4116000	4121000	Oh, you just gotta go to Voodoo Donuts and do some slacklining.
4124000	4127000	The tentacles shoot out of the floor and grapple you.
4127000	4129000	They wrap themselves around your legs.
4129000	4131000	You feel as if you can't move.
4131000	4137000	At the same time, the ponderous eyeball sways and its eye turns purple, and it looks directly at Sharpie.
4137000	4138000	What?
4138000	4139000	Sharpie.
4139000	4140000	I go like this.
4142000	4143000	Like what?
4143000	4146000	It seems like an impressive response.
4147000	4157000	As you make your excited and cool maneuver, you feel a haze come over you, and all of a sudden, you feel the presence of several enemies surrounding you.
4157000	4158000	Oh, shit.
4158000	4159000	I've been charmed against you guys.
4159000	4161000	Well, use some magic.
4161000	4162000	No.
4162000	4163000	Yeah, use some magic.
4163000	4164000	You're a mage.
4164000	4166000	Oh, can I resist it somehow?
4166000	4168000	No, you can fight the enemies you see.
4168000	4170000	No, I don't want to fight my friends.
4170000	4171000	You do?
4171000	4172000	That's the thing, though.
4172000	4173000	You can tell me that I want to fight them.
4173000	4175000	I've watched you go through this with Cheff.
4175000	4178000	Okay, you cast Scorching Ray on Moray.
4180000	4181000	It hits.
4189000	4190000	Dealing eight damage.
4190000	4191000	Eight damage.
4191000	4192000	Eight damage.
4192000	4197000	That's like fucking some average shit.
4197000	4200000	Some Bend Oregon kind of style.
4203000	4206000	That was some Eugene shit.
4206000	4207000	Yeah, yeah.
4208000	4211000	That was some Medford style bullshit.
4212000	4213000	Medford style.
4213000	4214000	You messed it up.
4214000	4215000	No.
4215000	4216000	No.
4216000	4217000	I know.
4217000	4218000	What do you want from me?
4218000	4219000	I just want the old Dan back.
4219000	4222000	I want you to take your shirt off.
4222000	4225000	Take your shirt off.
4225000	4226000	Take your shirt off.
4226000	4227000	Save it.
4227000	4228000	Save it.
4228000	4229000	Save it.
4229000	4230000	I said take your shirt off.
4230000	4231000	Oh, take my shirt off.
4231000	4233000	Who's turn is it, Spencer, for fuck's sake?
4233000	4236000	You see those orange things I mentioned earlier from the ceiling.
4236000	4241000	They're shaking wildly and shaking a violent red powder onto you.
4241000	4243000	It's making you guys sick.
4243000	4245000	You feel kind of sick to your stomachs.
4245000	4251000	I go into a power attack on one of the orange, sacky thingies.
4251000	4253000	They're pretty high up.
4253000	4255000	You'd have to jump to hit them.
4255000	4259000	I run and I first jump off of Moray's shoulders,
4259000	4261000	then onto Sharpie's shoulders,
4261000	4267000	and then jump as high as I can and swing my sword at one of the orange sacks.
4267000	4272000	Taking a few steps back to prepare your charge, you leap forward.
4272000	4275000	Kind of holding yourself off the back of the half-elf,
4275000	4279000	you leap high into the air and swing your sword in a wide arc.
4279000	4284000	You slice cleanly at the core, holding the dangling nerve cluster.
4284000	4290000	It falls off and falls to the ground and explodes into a pile of dust.
4296000	4298000	Never had a lesson.
4298000	4300000	Never had a lesson.
4300000	4303000	You hear the beast give an unearthly shake around you
4303000	4307000	as well as a long, far-off wail as if it were in immense pain.
4307000	4308000	Oh, we're close, you guys.
4308000	4310000	Somebody attack the other nerve cluster.
4311000	4315000	I take out my long sword, and yeah.
4315000	4316000	Zip?
4316000	4317000	Yeah.
4317000	4319000	I take out my long sword.
4319000	4321000	It looks great.
4321000	4323000	And I attack the other nerve cluster.
4323000	4325000	Well, it's too high up.
4325000	4326000	Well, you're too high up.
4326000	4327000	Yeah, I am.
4327000	4329000	I jump.
4329000	4331000	Okay, off Sharpie's back?
4331000	4333000	I jump off Sharpie's back.
4333000	4334000	Okay.
4334000	4336000	Super cute style.
4337000	4339000	All right.
4339000	4342000	Or would it be better to do arrows, Spencer?
4342000	4346000	It would be better to do arrows, to hit things far away.
4346000	4348000	Is it too late?
4348000	4351000	The question is, how many arrows should she shoot?
4351000	4354000	Six.
4354000	4358000	Well, I mean, I don't want to be a bad D&D player.
4358000	4361000	I did already say that I have the sword.
4361000	4362000	It's true.
4362000	4365000	Jumping off your friend Sharpie, you launch yourself with a nerve cluster.
4365000	4369000	You get right up to it, and pulling your sword from its holster,
4369000	4371000	you swing in a wide arc.
4371000	4374000	However it misses, and you tumble to the ground.
4378000	4380000	Dungeon snap.
4380000	4383000	Same team.
4383000	4384000	Thank you.
4384000	4386000	I will next time, ma'am.
4386000	4388000	I will.
4388000	4390000	Valicent.
4390000	4392000	Yeah, Valicent hasn't even followed you guys.
4392000	4395000	He's just making sandwiches.
4395000	4397000	He's back in the last area.
4397000	4399000	Sharpie, finish him off.
4399000	4402000	Sharpie, you shake off the effects of your charm.
4402000	4403000	I do?
4403000	4405000	Yeah.
4405000	4408000	I cast a Booyah.
4408000	4409000	No.
4409000	4412000	Sharpie, you attacked me.
4412000	4415000	I wasn't myself.
4415000	4419000	It's like last night when we got in that fight.
4419000	4421000	Over the straw?
4421000	4422000	Yeah.
4422000	4424000	What was the straw fight about?
4424000	4427000	It accused me of rooting his straw.
4435000	4440000	I handed her a Diet Coke, and she handed it back,
4440000	4446000	and the straw looked like an animal had mangled it.
4446000	4450000	It looked like a child had chewed it all day.
4450000	4452000	It was all twisted, and I thought it was funny.
4452000	4454000	So what the fuck?
4454000	4456000	But because I'm a professional entertainer,
4456000	4459000	I wasn't smiling and laughing when I was like,
4459000	4460000	hey, what the fuck?
4460000	4462000	And she was ignoring me because she was round that bend.
4462000	4464000	The fact that we had gotten Taco Bells
4464000	4466000	should tell you what state we were in.
4466000	4469000	We were, and we were watching Portland Public Access.
4469000	4471000	I just looked at the mangled straw, and I went,
4471000	4473000	hey, hey, what the fuck?
4473000	4476000	Because I was, yes, and-ing the fact that she was an animal.
4476000	4479000	I was like, what's with the fucking mangled straw?
4480000	4483000	But Dan, I think it's important to say that right before this happened,
4483000	4486000	Dan was like, I didn't get enough tacos.
4486000	4487000	So I gave him my taco.
4487000	4488000	That's not important.
4488000	4489000	That's like saying the sky is blue.
4489000	4491000	I never get enough tacos.
4491000	4493000	I don't know if it's a good plan, but whatever.
4493000	4494000	It's not, this is not.
4494000	4496000	Anyway, you said what the fuck.
4496000	4497000	I didn't think it was a joke.
4497000	4499000	I thought you were starting a fight over a straw.
4499000	4500000	Yeah.
4500000	4504000	Well, you're starting a fight over a straw.
4504000	4508000	Look, I love you more.
4508000	4509000	Nice.
4509000	4512000	Oh, well, that was supposed to be cute.
4512000	4513000	And yet it wasn't.
4513000	4514000	All right.
4514000	4516000	You're the best.
4516000	4518000	I cast...
4518000	4520000	Magic.
4520000	4521000	Who gives a shit?
4521000	4523000	Sorry.
4523000	4525000	I cast...
4525000	4532000	Scorching Ray!
4532000	4533000	Oh, boy.
4533000	4534000	Oh, Ray.
4534000	4535000	There's a ray.
4535000	4536000	It's a scorching ray.
4536000	4537000	It's hotter than a cold ray, hotter than the sun.
4537000	4539000	Go to Scorching Ray and then we're done.
4539000	4543000	Scorching Ray's gonna cast some damage on these motherfucker motherfucker.
4543000	4545000	Portly ain't got a scorching ray.
4545000	4546000	Motherfucker got a scorching ray.
4546000	4553000	What do you shoot it at?
4553000	4556000	Oh, uh...
4556000	4557000	You gotta aim it at something.
4557000	4558000	Yeah.
4558000	4560000	Is the eye stock still there?
4560000	4561000	There is that eye stock.
4561000	4562000	Yeah, fuck that guy.
4562000	4563000	Yeah, fuck that guy.
4563000	4565000	The guy that got me, the guy that charmed me.
4565000	4566000	All right.
4566000	4568000	Your scorching ray strikes true.
4568000	4572000	It strikes the eye directly in its lens.
4572000	4576000	Dealing 18 damage.
4576000	4580000	The eye stock closes its eye and starts crying a bit.
4580000	4582000	I go like this.
4582000	4589000	I attack with my emerald dagger at the eye stock.
4589000	4591000	You attack the eye stock with the emerald dagger?
4591000	4592000	Yes.
4592000	4593000	Okay.
4593000	4596000	Attacking the eye stock with your emerald dagger,
4596000	4598000	you notice that it misses.
4598000	4600000	It strikes by a lamp.
4600000	4602000	I notice that it misses.
4602000	4606000	It's a sad state of affairs, but there you go.
4606000	4611000	I look at my dagger and go, way to go.
4611000	4616000	It goes, well, that's the first time you've ever talked to me.
4616000	4619000	I say to the dagger, look, I didn't know you could speak.
4619000	4622000	Yes, you know, there's a lot of magic items that can speak.
4622000	4626000	Okay, look, let's not fight like Aaron and Dan.
4626000	4628000	You should kill that other orange thing.
4628000	4630000	It seemed like it pissed that thing off.
4630000	4631000	Don't tell me what to do, dagger.
4631000	4632000	I'm in charge here.
4632000	4634000	Do you know how magic I am?
4634000	4635000	I don't know.
4635000	4637000	I didn't know you could talk.
4637000	4639000	If I knew that you were a magical talking dagger,
4639000	4641000	I'd have asked you what to do.
4641000	4643000	Well, apparently we can fill a book with stuff you don't know,
4643000	4649000	but I know you should kill that because he's a barbarian.
4649000	4651000	But I know that you should attack that orange thing
4651000	4653000	because I'm magic in a dagger.
4653000	4655000	Okay, well, I tried to attack the eyestock,
4655000	4656000	and you fucking failed me.
4656000	4659000	Like, this relationship has to be built on trust.
4659000	4661000	Yeah, well, I didn't trust that we could, you know,
4661000	4662000	harm that eyestock.
4662000	4663000	Okay, okay, look, look.
4663000	4664000	I'm pacing it with this conversation.
4664000	4668000	Emerald dagger, shut the fuck up, Maureen.
4668000	4670000	I'm having a conversation with my dagger right now.
4670000	4671000	Interesting.
4671000	4673000	I wonder if the podcast is going to be at seven emails
4673000	4675000	talking about how your relationship with the dagger
4675000	4680000	ruined the podcast.
4680000	4683000	I don't know.
4683000	4684000	I liked it.
4684000	4691000	It felt honest.
4691000	4694000	I mean, I really love you and the dagger together, but...
4694000	4696000	You both need to chill.
4696000	4697000	All right.
4697000	4700000	Because my dagger is not a person, it's a dagger,
4700000	4702000	I come to an agreement, and I say,
4702000	4704000	look, from now on in the future,
4704000	4706000	let's just communicate with each other.
4706000	4711000	And if I'm ever not living up to your standards
4711000	4714000	as a dagger holder, you just say so,
4714000	4716000	and I'll try to become a better barbarian.
4716000	4719000	And if I ever have a problem with your effectiveness
4719000	4721000	as a dagger, I'll just say so,
4721000	4723000	and then maybe together we can grow,
4723000	4727000	and one day I'll live up to who I should be
4727000	4728000	and what you should be,
4728000	4731000	and together we'll form a union
4731000	4733000	and be better people for it.
4733000	4742000	A lot of experts update us, everybody.
4742000	4743000	And then I say,
4743000	4745000	and the next time I fucking attack an ice talk,
4745000	4749000	fucking get your shit together.
4749000	4751000	So a partnership is equals,
4751000	4753000	that sounds pretty good.
4753000	4754000	All right.
4754000	4755000	Yeah.
4755000	4756000	All right.
4756000	4758000	Let's attack stuff together.
4758000	4761000	You know what, dagger?
4762000	4763000	Talking to you, dagger.
4763000	4766000	Oh, I thought you meant you were throwing an ice on your bed.
4766000	4767000	No, dagger?
4767000	4770000	Okay. What's up? Hey.
4770000	4773000	You're okay.
4773000	4778000	You too, man.
4778000	4781000	I love my dagger.
4781000	4785000	The worst TV pilot ever.
4785000	4790000	Quarken dagger.
4790000	4792000	Quarken dagger.
4792000	4794000	Starring Daphne Coleman.
4794000	4796000	That's your boss that sent you out.
4796000	4797000	Quark!
4797000	4798000	What is it, dagger?
4798000	4800000	You don't have a dagger in your pocket, do you?
4800000	4801000	No, I don't.
4801000	4802000	What was that?
4802000	4803000	What was that sound?
4803000	4807000	That was my badge and my gun.
4807000	4808000	Quarken dagger.
4808000	4809000	Friday.
4809000	4811000	You know this police department has a strict rule
4811000	4815000	against talking daggers.
4815000	4818000	So, yeah, are you going to hit stuff?
4819000	4820000	Do it.
4820000	4821000	Dagger.
4821000	4824000	Hey.
4824000	4826000	Gosh, what did Spencer and Jeff start a dagger?
4826000	4827000	I know it's not my turn.
4827000	4828000	You're the best.
4828000	4830000	Let's go out of turn one more time.
4830000	4832000	Well, I don't think you've taken any combat action.
4832000	4833000	Okay.
4833000	4834000	Dagger.
4834000	4839000	I tell dagger, I believe in you,
4839000	4841000	and I want you to hold me like a dagger.
4841000	4845000	And the dagger summons a power to use me as a sword
4845000	4849000	and holds me and wields me like a blade.
4849000	4855000	And we charge towards the last remaining nerve sack.
4855000	4859000	And my dagger wields me like a dagger
4859000	4863000	and holds my ankles and my head straight.
4863000	4866000	I hold my sword up in the air,
4866000	4872000	and the dagger swings me at the last remaining nerve sack.
4872000	4874000	You know the crazy thing is that I had a cursed sword
4874000	4877000	that actually would wield its wielder like that.
4877000	4881000	So that's not even an entirely original ideal.
4884000	4887000	No, dungeon, like super dungeon.
4887000	4888000	I like it.
4888000	4889000	It's a good plan.
4889000	4892000	But that's not the magic that's enchanting this dagger,
4892000	4893000	unfortunately.
4893000	4895000	Dungeon snap, writer's workshop snap,
4895000	4897000	like Los Angeles snap.
4897000	4898000	So you're saying that can't happen?
4898000	4899000	No, but I am.
4899000	4900000	Okay, fuck it.
4900000	4903000	I take my dagger with our newfound relationship
4903000	4906000	and with an extra confidence that I never knew existed,
4906000	4909000	I wield my emerald dagger and I run right at the heart.
4909000	4911000	Right at the heart.
4911000	4913000	You strike it critically.
4913000	4914000	Well, look at that.
4914000	4915000	That's glowing.
4915000	4916000	That's crazy.
4916000	4918000	What are the fucking odds, right?
4918000	4919000	How much?
4919000	4920000	What are the odds of that?
4920000	4924000	Like, honestly, dealing 30 damage.
4924000	4938000	You strike a great blow against the heart.
4938000	4941000	It gives a violent shutter and starts to ooze blood.
4941000	4946000	The entire room you're in shudders and quakes and you take some damages.
4946000	4947000	We all do?
4947000	4950000	Yeah, from the quaking and shaking of the thing you're inside of.
4950000	4951000	Fair enough.
4951000	4952000	You all take four damage.
4952000	4953000	That's nothing.
4953000	4955000	That's some quake shit.
4955000	4957000	It's definitely injured, but not dead.
4957000	4960000	By the way, Spencer's using the dice that whoever brought the dice.
4960000	4962000	Yeah, who got me these awesome dice?
4962000	4963000	These are fucking sweet.
4963000	4964000	Who did it?
4964000	4965000	This one.
4965000	4966000	Oh, I can't see him.
4966000	4967000	What's his name?
4967000	4968000	Tom.
4968000	4969000	Nice.
4969000	4970000	Tom.
4970000	4971000	Tom.
4971000	4972000	Thank you, Tom.
4972000	4973000	These are the coolest things ever.
4973000	4974000	We're the podcast listeners.
4974000	4979000	He looks like a very crafty Jesus in the back.
4979000	4981000	Good looking guy.
4982000	4983000	Thanks, Tom.
4984000	4985000	These are some sweet dice.
4985000	4986000	All right, guys.
4986000	4987000	Finish it off.
4987000	4989000	I had a breakthrough with my sword.
4989000	4993000	So, Spencer, is the heart done?
4993000	4994000	It's not.
4994000	4996000	I mean, we might want to break here, to be honest.
4996000	4998000	Oh, the heart's a full-time job, huh?
4998000	4999000	Well, yeah.
4999000	5002000	It's a tough job, but someone's got to pump it.
5003000	5007000	Before we stop, can I shoot two good arrows?
5007000	5008000	At?
5008000	5009000	At the heart?
5009000	5010000	At the heart.
5010000	5011000	Yes.
5011000	5012000	Yes, you can.
5012000	5013000	And give me 20.
5013000	5016000	Well, I tried.
5016000	5020000	One of your arrows strikes the heart directly in the heart.
5022000	5023000	All right.
5023000	5025000	Dealing 11 damage.
5031000	5032000	Good arrow.
5032000	5033000	Just dagger or winks at me.
5033000	5034000	No.
5034000	5036000	No eyes.
5036000	5039000	But the jewel, it glimmers in a winking fashion.
5039000	5041000	It glistens.
5042000	5045000	And I accept that glisten as a wink.
5045000	5046000	That's fair.
5046000	5048000	So, you think the heart's really that full-time job?
5048000	5049000	We should stop here, huh?
5049000	5050000	Yeah.
5050000	5051000	No, you're not.
5051000	5052000	You haven't killed it.
5052000	5053000	All right.
5053000	5054000	Well, let's stop that.
5054000	5055000	Spencer, everybody.
5055000	5056000	Spencer Clifhanger!
5057000	5058000	Fuck yeah.
5060000	5062000	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
5062000	5063000	Lucky Labrador.
5063000	5065000	Aaron McGathey and Spencer Crittenden.
5070000	5071000	Wow.
5072000	5073000	All right.
5073000	5074000	Portland.
5074000	5080000	Home of good, wonderful, artistic, beautiful, clean,
5080000	5085000	spiritual, wonderful, transparent people through whom God
5085000	5090000	flows constantly and that government cannot crack.
5090000	5094000	We need to come up with our fucking constitution here before
5094000	5095000	we go to San Francisco.
5095000	5097000	Because you know in San Francisco, they'll just go like,
5097000	5098000	go to the park wherever you want.
5098000	5099000	And they'll be like crazy.
5100000	5103000	In Portland, like, these are people who sculpt things and
5103000	5104000	like understand things.
5104000	5106000	They program things.
5106000	5109000	There's like people, they're a practical people, Jeff.
5109000	5110000	They're a good people.
5110000	5112000	They're a port people.
5113000	5114000	It's called Portland.
5114000	5116000	It's named after the port of Portland.
5116000	5117000	Is that right?
5117000	5118000	Ships come in.
5118000	5119000	You have to get shit done.
5119000	5122000	When a ship full of salt comes in, you've got to put the salt
5122000	5123000	somewhere.
5123000	5125000	There's another ship full of pepper coming in.
5126000	5129000	They've adapted a culture of, it's called the New York of
5129000	5130000	the West.
5130000	5132000	Can we get a representative of Portland, somebody who feels
5132000	5134000	that they know the most about it.
5134000	5138000	Who among us right now would be the most representative?
5138000	5139000	Do we want to?
5139000	5140000	Right here?
5140000	5141000	You sir.
5141000	5142000	You seem lumberjack style.
5142000	5144000	Our first dude of the night.
5144000	5145000	What's your name, sir?
5145000	5146000	Huh?
5146000	5147000	Ryan.
5147000	5148000	Ryan, everybody.
5148000	5149000	A Portlandologist.
5150000	5151000	Ryan.
5151000	5152000	Grab a mic.
5153000	5154000	All right.
5155000	5158000	So, Portland actually is named after Portland Maine off a
5158000	5159000	penny flip.
5160000	5161000	All right.
5165000	5167000	Who is flipping the penny?
5167000	5170000	So two guys moved here, one from Boston, one from Portland,
5170000	5173000	and they both wanted to name it after their home cities, and
5173000	5175000	they flipped the penny and it came up Portland and now that
5175000	5177000	penny is in the museum.
5177000	5178000	No shit.
5178000	5180000	You know the craziest thing about it?
5180000	5182000	Because that was 1820.
5182000	5183000	There was no one on the penny.
5185000	5189000	So there was no, people say that Portland just made it up.
5189000	5190000	Yeah.
5190000	5192000	Because Abe Lincoln was, he was just running around, he was
5192000	5193000	in college at that time.
5193000	5197000	One side just had the word heads and the other side had tails.
5197000	5200000	Just said penny side one, penny side two.
5202000	5203000	Yeah.
5203000	5204000	Anyways.
5204000	5205000	Ryan.
5205000	5207000	Ryan, are you a local?
5207000	5210000	No, I moved here four years ago to start med school and I'm
5210000	5213000	actually moving away tomorrow because I just graduated.
5213000	5214000	Oh, good for you.
5214000	5215000	Congratulations.
5215000	5217000	What kind of, what do you, what?
5217000	5218000	I'm a chiropractor.
5218000	5219000	Oh, okay.
5219000	5222000	So kind of, kind of real medicine.
5222000	5224000	Oh, fuck you guys.
5227000	5230000	Something like, like, like spine surgeon just booed you.
5230000	5232000	Chiropractor, boo.
5234000	5235000	Yeah, yeah.
5235000	5238000	Well, I don't, yeah, I went to a chiropractor for a while.
5238000	5241000	I had to, I have a terrible history of back pain in my
5241000	5243000	family, but then I got one of those inversion tables.
5243000	5244000	Oh, yeah.
5244000	5245000	Those are awesome.
5245000	5247000	Do your people, they don't recommend them though, right?
5247000	5249000	No, inversion tables are great.
5249000	5250000	And you're out of a job.
5250000	5252000	No, it doesn't, it doesn't fix everything.
5252000	5253000	It just helps.
5253000	5254000	It fixes everything for me.
5254000	5255000	I mean, it helped.
5255000	5259000	I mean, it made me not have to go to a chiropractor ever again.
5259000	5261000	I mean, I don't care if you don't see me.
5261000	5263000	I just feel that if you get better, that's all I want.
5263000	5264000	Really?
5267000	5268000	I'm hugging him.
5268000	5270000	I'm making up with chiropractors tonight.
5271000	5272000	Yo.
5272000	5273000	Yo.
5273000	5274000	Yeah.
5274000	5275000	Yo.
5275000	5276000	Back doctor.
5276000	5277000	Yo.
5277000	5279000	I want to rock, rock, rock, rock too.
5279000	5280000	What?
5280000	5281000	Doesn't matter.
5281000	5282000	Yo.
5282000	5283000	It's Ryan?
5283000	5284000	Ryan.
5284000	5285000	Yo.
5285000	5286000	Yo.
5286000	5287000	Ryan, Ryan.
5287000	5288000	Back pain.
5288000	5290000	I'm running the rain.
5290000	5293000	I'm going to feel the strength and heal myself with my pain.
5293000	5296000	I'm going to bend over backwards for my lower lumbar.
5296000	5299000	I fucked your mama so hard she never come so far.
5299000	5302000	I fucked your mama until she had back spasms.
5302000	5305000	I fucked your mama and her pussy was a chasm.
5305000	5309000	The sky dove down to its bottom and fucked your mama so hard
5309000	5313000	I started to feel it was a Gotham.
5313000	5316000	I didn't really want to rap, but I think that's what...
5316000	5317000	It wasn't feeling it.
5317000	5321000	I wanted to talk to Ryan for a little bit about Portland.
5321000	5322000	That's why you brought him up.
5322000	5323000	I don't care.
5323000	5327000	When he played that song, it felt joyless and forced.
5327000	5328000	I liked it.
5328000	5329000	That was good.
5329000	5330000	Thanks.
5330000	5331000	Yo.
5331000	5332000	Yo.
5332000	5338000	I'm awful sorry I blamed my bad rap on you.
5338000	5341000	I didn't mean to take a crap on you.
5341000	5343000	I came up to Portland to transform.
5343000	5346000	I fucked your mama so hard I needed chloroform.
5346000	5350000	That doesn't mean it was non-consensual.
5350000	5353000	I fucked your mama good, but it was quite sensual.
5353000	5356000	I met her at a diner and said, let's go out.
5356000	5357000	I fucked her good.
5357000	5361000	And then she started to scream and shout, but not in protest.
5361000	5362000	Enjoy.
5362000	5366000	I fucked your mama, impregnated her, and made a boy.
5366000	5368000	It was you.
5368000	5369000	Ryan.
5369000	5371000	I'm your father.

5374000	5377000	Turn that frown upside down.
5377000	5378000	Back pain.

5381000	5383000	Come on down to harmen town.
5383000	5385000	Little bones from your butt to your neck.
5385000	5387000	They make your whole body work.
5387000	5389000	And if they get wrecked, you're fucked up.
5389000	5391000	Because heck, you've got to go to a doctor.
5391000	5395000	But if it's not a real doctor, you've got to go to a chiropractor.
5395000	5397000	He'll delay you down.
5397000	5400000	He'll snap your back, and he'll turn you around.
5400000	5402000	And he'll say, does that feel good?
5402000	5403000	And you'll say, yes, it did.
5403000	5406000	And he'll say, come back in a week no matter what.

5457000	5460000	The one you just mentioned, rub it like I should.
5460000	5461000	I won't make a wish.
5461000	5463000	I won't wish for a genie.
5463000	5466000	I just want to reach out and touch a weenie.
5466000	5469000	I hope that it makes my back feel better.
5469000	5472000	I hope you look good in a cashmere sweater.
5472000	5475000	Want to take you home and put on some music.
5475000	5479000	I'd like to fuck your mama so hard she won't know how to use it.

5496000	5499000	You go to a chiropractor for your spine.
5499000	5502000	If you think that you can get it, you will be fine.
5502000	5505000	After about three sessions, you're feeling better.
5505000	5509000	And if you know it, pussy, something wetter.
5509000	5511000	Gonna rap, gonna rap some more.

5539000	5542000	I've been listening to Dan and Ryan and Spencer flow.
5542000	5545000	But now I guess I have to let the lyrics flow.
5545000	5550000	I've been sitting there and I think I love Portland so much that it's the coolest town in the northwest.
5550000	5554000	It's such a cool town because the food is great and the booze is flowing.
5554000	5558000	I like the fact that the hoes are growing.
5558000	5559000	The hoes are growing.
5559000	5560000	It's a weird thing.
5560000	5562000	Hoes actually turn into bros.
5562000	5566000	And that's why the Portland water always flows.
5566000	5567000	Oh shit.
5567000	5568000	God damn it.
5568000	5570000	Let's get the pink ladies up here.
