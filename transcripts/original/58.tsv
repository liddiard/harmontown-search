0	24680	Hello Meltdown, how is everybody doing this evening?
24680	28220	I sort of got that feeling there's a free sound in the air, there's some electric energy
28220	31980	going on here at Meltdown Comics here in Hollywood, California.
31980	36740	Good news everybody, Harman Town once again is now in session.
36740	47420	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
47420	69980	If it seems like I'm taller, they raised the stage here at Meltdown, it's not just
69980	82340	because I got my job back, I'm not like floating, I got my job back, that sounds a lot more
82340	90300	pathetic than the heroic triumph, you lissies coming home and slaying the suitors.
90300	91860	Are we allowed to talk about this this week?
91860	100660	I think so, I mean kind of, my agents keep telling me shut the fuck up, and rightfully
100660	104680	so because their job is to close a deal that is not yet officially closed, these things
104680	110100	take forever, 90% of the time, probably 99% of the time when writers are in a writer's
110100	114500	room their deals aren't closed yet, they're kind of in the process, third season my deal
114500	118460	was so not closed there was actually a kind of debacle, which is probably one of the 800
118460	123420	reasons I got fired, because the deal wasn't closed and then Sony put a quote clock on
123420	131580	my offer, that means you have to, by sundown you better be in the street or you're going
131580	137340	to be in a box or whatever cowboy they thought they were as a transnational conglomerate
137340	144180	and I went to the roost in Las Villas and all the writers followed me and I sat there
144180	149260	and I had a drink and I put a clock on them through my lawyers and I think stuff like
149260	153180	that probably is why they're like when we do get to fire this guy let's just fire him,
153180	159060	he was such a dick, but now I have returned and you know what's great?
159060	172660	I have not changed, I have learned nothing, I have only learned that Joel McHale is the
172660	178340	most powerful man in television, because the truth is nobody wanted me back except
178340	186500	the actors, thank Joel McHale if you want to be happy for somebody, I will do my best
186500	191700	to make 13 great episodes until I make even a single good one, don't pat me on the back
191700	201380	because the truth is these companies they weren't like you know who we miss, like Joel
201380	205140	sometimes this happens in TV, the actors, the actual people in the trenches, the people
205140	209900	that create the product that you enjoy, the people who are locked in a hot box for 12
209900	214440	hours a day, they're the ones that still end up caring about the show enough to bother
214440	220100	to affect a thing and Joel, I don't know how much he's comfortable owning up to this, I
220100	225540	don't know, so just thank him and leave it at that I guess, I don't know, like we'll
225540	233260	have him on or something and he would tell the story, but he's amazing, I mean he's a
233260	237500	great guy, a great dad, one of those dads that throws his kid up in the air and catches
237500	241620	him, like throws his kid up back when his kids were small enough to be thrown, that
241620	245500	was my first impression of him, he grabbed one of his kids and tossed him like 12 feet
245500	249920	in the air, I'm not kidding and then caught him and I remember thinking like my dad couldn't
249920	255920	do that and I can't, I will not be able to do that and that explains everything, that's
255920	265680	why I'm a writer and he's an actor, it's because he had a dad that must have caught him, if
265680	275120	my dad threw me 12 feet, there was no return, it was just like a trip, you know, alright
275120	287280	well let's, I want to bring Spencer up earlier than usual, let's just bring him up on Ceremonies,
287280	293280	careful yeah, they raised the stage, so if you're tall enough you could die tonight,
293280	299440	I'm fine down here thank you, hello Spencer how are you, I'm good, I'm good, I wanted
299440	304760	to make sure you got a good seat because there was a rumor in the green room that Adam Goldberg
304760	313320	has lost his mind and has somehow gave himself the role of seating people, like he was seating
313320	316600	people and he was just telling them where they could sit, like giving away reserved
316600	323000	seats and like telling people they couldn't save seats and like is he on crack or something,
323000	329360	Adam where are you, alright can you come up and explain yourself, it's a comical misunderstanding
329600	337040	it makes me less funny when I repeat it, Adam you don't want to come up, this must be serious,
342800	347520	alright Adam Goldberg, a rare reluctance, Adam Goldberg,
350720	355680	how's it going Dan, how's it going Spencer, how's it going Jeff, I'm sure these things,
355680	360160	I'm sure these things get conflated as they as they reach me back in the in the mayor's chamber
360880	368960	but reportedly you you've just gone off the rails, I you know when you try and date several people
368960	375440	on the same night, humble brag, you have to switch between expensive restaurants back and forth, oh
375440	383680	oh that's a metaphor sorry okay, I was like that was the world's biggest shoe hard, I love how easily
383680	390000	you bought that premise, yeah I mean he he took over a room of course, I mean that's probably the
390000	393760	whole thing, there's women coming in and he's going like well, when you're smashing as much
393760	401360	puss as I am on a daily basis, I don't smash, there are three rules because it rhymes, you
401360	406960	smush puss, yeah get down on it, when you have a lot of dates in consecutive years,
406960	411440	I'm still not biting,
415520	422720	no fair enough, okay let me count back, but yeah everyone wants to sit with me, you're all my best
422720	428880	friends, all of you guys, especially the new guys who don't know that that's false and the thing is
428880	432960	I was like hey, want to save some seats, hey could you save me some seats, hey could you save me some
432960	437840	seats, and I'm like yeah sit over in this general vicinity, which has turned me into the left thumb
437840	444400	right thumb guy, you got roped into saving seats for people, yeah oh can anybody verify that is
444400	452720	that actually true, now I've heard, Judas you're all betrayers, all betraying, in my hour of need,
452720	459040	if one person in your pack of disciples betrays you they might be a Judas, if you're in a sea of
459120	468000	Judas, you might be Judas, we have an audience full of disciples, I was gonna say Barabbas,
471920	479040	I'm not parting with my silver that easily, you sound like you have a little cold, yeah it's been
479040	485120	you know I've been getting out and about in consecutive days because of my back brace,
485120	490800	so I can't get all the vigorous physical activity, smash and push, smash and push that I might like,
491760	500080	yeah so, I like this mic, the back brace is part of the Adam Goldberg, this is the new action
500080	506400	figure release push, push smashing Adam Goldberg, the workman's comp item is available with all the
506480	508880	things I've seen here, special push smashing grip,
512560	517360	just so we have to buy another one, another Adam Goldberg on the shelf, it's like a new haircut
517360	524160	Dan, that's worth the purchase, but like couldn't my old Adam smoosh push, I got him in the
526720	531120	30 cent spin at salvation army, the smoosh push is your country line dance,
531120	536000	can we do the smoosh push,
543120	548400	I am in the back brace, it's about as good as Adam Goldberg's coming, he's smashing all the
548400	559360	push, he's coming around the corner, but his name is Adam Goldberg, I can't move that very far,
562960	570080	when I get my workers' comp checks, action figure gets guitar, all right,
570640	576320	stay tuned for guitar, smash push, Adam Goldberg everybody, wow, thank you Adam Goldberg,
576320	582160	okay, he dismissed himself, and he actually walked off the stage to applause,
583840	590400	we are the Caesar Milan to the Adam Goldbergs of the world, we're rehabilitating him,
591040	596080	and yet in a world where you get fired and rehired and you don't change, you're creating change,
596080	601120	I'm changing everybody, I don't know what I did to his back, but I changed, for those of you
601120	606880	listening, I'll tell you the words back brace, I don't want you to conjure too fragile or tragic
606880	611040	an image, I mean he just, he's just wearing a, looks like a cummerbund, we've talked about it
611040	618000	before, it's like a big cummerbund with suspenders on it, and yeah, you have to go back into the
618000	622240	archives and listen to Adam come up and talk about his family's history of back problems, and
623040	630880	there's little flashes of humanity in there, here and there, it's pretty charming,
632000	636560	all right, so can we talk a little bit about this haircut, I know it's not good podcast material,
637120	643040	but it's nearly military, you look a little bit like Randy Quaid from The Last Detail,
645440	649760	I got drunk in Chicago with Dino, and I think how that movie starts too, yeah,
651200	657120	and I wandered into a stylist salon barber shop, I don't know the difference between the three,
657440	672000	I mean, it had a pointed nose and it laid eggs in dry land, so that's a salon, and they were bummed
672000	677200	out, you've never seen three gay guys more sad, like I mean, and gay guys have it bad, like they
677200	682080	live in a world of bad plight, Illinois is now recently going through their own debacle with
682560	688080	marriage rights and things, so I learned while I was there, we've been down that road here in
688080	695680	California, we don't even give a shit anymore, we're battle weary, but in Illinois now the battle
695680	701680	rages on, and they were not in the mood to cut Charles Manson's hair when he rolled in off the
701680	707200	Chicago streets with Dino, I think they maybe were relieved when Dino walked out, like when he was
707200	713680	like, I'll see you later, and they thought he was my partner, and I like, which they should,
713680	721120	you know, they should assume that, and he might as well be, and we chatted about, you know,
721120	726880	I'm down with gay people. Did they trim your beard too, is that what you were doing? They trimmed my
726880	732480	beard. That is a razor, laser precision. Yeah, it's although they made me look like Bob Greenblatt,
732560	738400	they made me, it's too trimmed. I've changed, I've turned into Darth Vader.
739680	745600	I am my own, yeah, that's the tragedy. He still works there, right? Yeah, but give me a break.
746960	755040	I mean, that place changes, I worked for three people while I was there, I got a feeling I'm
755040	759120	going to be working for a fourth at some point, right? Look, I don't know how they do their
759120	766480	business, I just, I saw the animal practice. I don't know what decisions, how they make their
766480	772320	decisions. I saw the billboard with the doctor that had the face in his hands. What was that
772320	776640	called? No holds barred, do no harm. What was that? It was a doctor, he saw that billboard,
776640	781760	someone greenlit that billboard, someone looked at that on an easel and was like, ship it. Like,
783440	787040	I see a doctor, he's got scrubs on because you wouldn't be able to tell he's a doctor,
787040	791840	he's holding his hands up in the traditional, I'm about to go into surgery doctor pose,
791840	796080	except that they have to be mushed together so that we could put an evil face on the back of his
796080	801840	hands, indicating that like a kind of a Jekyll and Hyde thing. I'll take four episodes.
804720	808720	Speaking of which, you have not watched season four of Community? No, I have not. Are you gonna,
808720	812960	you have to get down or watch? Yeah, I gotta get down to business and watch that, yes. Yes,
813600	818480	and Sony, to their credit, they expressed interest in the idea of recording me
819040	821280	doing the commentary track, like watching.
826800	831040	They're so into it that they're starting to make me like, now I'm not into it anymore. Like,
831040	834400	like, that's the thing. Like, you know, you tweet something shitty and then like,
834400	837520	Sony's like, this is awesome. Can't wait for Comic Con. And you're like, fuck you.
837680	844000	You know, they're invincible because they're a machine. They're not human. Like, they don't
844000	851920	have a heart. They have a little cog, a little DVD player. I've said before, by the way,
851920	856320	that people that work in like special features and stuff like that, like Sony, Sony is a gigantic
856320	861760	company. I think you know that they make cookies, they make bottle openers. They must make landmines
861760	866880	if any company ever did. There's got to be somehow, some way there's got to be making landmines. I
866880	871680	think that's GE. I know, but Sony must have been jealous. It's like, we got to get in on that racket.
872800	879920	We're not blowing enough people up. But I don't know. So there's a lot of fantastic people there.
881200	886720	Corporations are inhuman and therefore vile by nature. But within them, there are little heroes.
886720	891280	And some of them are the people that make the little Sony DVDs. Because they love making DVDs.
891920	896640	They love special features. They love the fans loving special features. And when the three
896640	902160	seasons I was working there, I made friends with the people in the DVD department. We had a lot of
902160	912080	fun. It's hard for you to say nice things about those people. That was difficult for you.
913200	919200	Spencer, what do you think? What about you getting maybe a job back in with the works?
920240	924400	I don't know. Yeah. I mean, what do you think of my haircut? What do you think of
925120	930720	Chicago? What do you think of gay people? I was discussing it, you know, the haircut. And
931840	941200	we landed on like an army guy, which I enjoy. Fuck everybody. Yeah. But yeah, yeah. Army guy. Anyway,
941200	948000	gay people. Great. Yeah. Like they should have it better in that place. Detroit, Chicago. Chicago.
948080	955440	Chicago. Yeah, they should have it better there. Sure. Chicago is a good place. I've said it before
955440	960880	and I'll say it again. I don't understand anyone that's not in favor of gay rights because it's
960880	967680	such a tee up. You can be a hero by not giving a fuck. It's one of the only causes. It's so easy.
970080	976400	When are you going to get that opportunity? Every other cause demands like a picket sign or like
976400	980960	do something like you can be such a hero by just standing there and going, I don't care.
982160	987760	I don't care. Like just, I mean, when something comes along like that, do it.
988480	990320	You can't help black people by not caring.
990320	1002080	Try it. I dare you. You will hurt them by not caring.
1008400	1011200	Speaking of me saying weird things and the audience reacting weirdly,
1013040	1017600	we have a lost episode. Harmon town has a lost episode. It's our first audio problems. Was it?
1017680	1022640	I think, yeah, the audio problem was that I kept talking about getting my job back at community
1022640	1026400	and I wasn't supposed to yet. I'm probably not supposed to now, but we don't have to release
1026400	1030800	this necessarily tomorrow. Like I said, we're in the final stages of making an official and I,
1030800	1033520	I don't know what compromises it. I don't know what, I'm not an agent. I don't know,
1033520	1036640	I don't work in that. I don't, I don't know. I don't know what happens. Like if a corporation
1036640	1044560	is going like, all right, should you get, should you get $55,000 in a parking space or $56,000
1044640	1052320	and he's got to park his own car. This is Jeff Jefferson from, uh, parking, parking relations.
1052320	1057280	And we got a parking spot over here for Jason Alexander. We were just promised him. It was
1057280	1064160	season two. Uh, if I could interrupt there, the key to this operation is going to be synergy
1064160	1071840	without a doubt. We've said a thousand times in parking space, you could make a thousand parking
1071840	1074960	spaces. It's not going to make a television show. Sorry, I'm sorry. It's a conference call. Would
1074960	1080640	you identify yourself, please? Uh, this is, uh, this is just, this is just, uh, John the janitor.
1085920	1091200	But if this mop could talk, it would tell you you don't make a show with parking spaces.
1092800	1098640	Thank you, John. I think we understand your points. Excuse me. Is that the mop talking now?
1098640	1106560	Yes. This is, this is Marla the mop. Um, we are overextended this fiscal quarter.
1108000	1117840	I have been squeezed over and over again to the point where we're rearranging deck chairs on the
1118640	1124240	Titanic and mopping the area underneath them with people like me, mops like me. Who cares? Edit this
1124240	1130480	out. We're going to have another last episode if I do enough bad improv.
1134400	1137360	That's a dangerous precedent. It's just going to be a test pattern. When you
1137360	1140240	download, it's just going to be a recording of an Indian.
1144160	1147600	Hello. You can't see me right now when I'm an Indian.
1149120	1152560	The episode you were searching for had audio difficulties.
1154240	1160720	They make me cry. There was much talk of, there was much talk of black people and Sony last week.
1164480	1167520	Mr. Harmon's words were like litter across a freeway.
1169760	1172480	His improv was like an eagle lost in the wind.
1172480	1185840	Mr. Harmon or as we call him limping beaver trying to do make them ups.
1187360	1191200	All right. Uh, okay. We still have some, we still have some, some business. This is a town meeting.
1192880	1196320	By the way, thanks. Thank you for showing up in so many numbers, but also, I don't know,
1196320	1200240	isn't there kind of a dark side to that too? Like, fuck you. Like, like, I guess you just hated me
1200240	1205360	because I was fired. All right. Wow. Maybe you were busy. Maybe you were busy.
1209760	1213760	I mean, don't feel bad for coming. That would be counterproductive of me to make happen.
1214960	1220480	Just think about how I feel sometimes when you randomly show up, like when I get fired and then
1220480	1224720	when I get rehired and then all the time in between, it's as if my stories about jerking
1224720	1234960	off and my bathtub aren't enough to bring you out from Tarzana. I drop by once in a while. I
1234960	1239760	know how many people show up when a real comedian gets up and does material. It hurts my feelings.
1242320	1246560	It's like you expect me to write things in order for me to have value.
1246560	1254160	Speaking of value, big value is going on at the harmontown.com store online.
1256960	1264880	We are having what's called a flash sale. I don't know if that means that you need flash installed
1266720	1271920	to participate or if that just means it's like a flash mob derivative. Like, it's like a sale,
1271920	1278160	like super fast. What if a bunch of people just showed up somewhere and started like conducting
1278160	1283600	like retail business, just like a flash sale. Like you just bring a bunch of like garments and then
1283600	1288560	people buy them. Yeah. That'd be amazing. Just spontaneous acts of capitalism. Yeah.
1290240	1295920	It's a flash sale. People like in the outer periphery, like trading, like someone makes
1295920	1300400	it a public offering like on the business going on in there. So there's people on the outer rim
1300480	1306160	like trading stock in the company and it's like spreading and it's just an explosion of capitalism.
1306160	1310000	And there's Adam Goldberg with little suspenders and bow tie on right in the middle of it.
1312000	1314480	We could call it Wall Street Occupy.
1316480	1319680	There you go. A little reverse. Like they take back the night.
1319680	1331520	All right. So if you go to harmontown.com and then in now, don't do it now, watch the show
1331520	1336240	and then then go get a t-shirt. It's cheaper now. Do we sell them here? Do we bring merchandise
1336240	1342160	here? I don't think we do. And it's because it gets complicated because the nerd melt theater
1342160	1347600	that lets us do a stuff here. If you sell merchandise here, then you have to figure
1347600	1352720	out what the vague is and all this stuff. You have to calculate consignments and things.
1352720	1355920	It would be perfectly fair to them and we're not doing it because we're so greedy and I don't
1355920	1360720	think anyone's doing anything out of greed. It's just complicated. We just sell our t-shirts online.
1360720	1364640	If that's not true and it would be easy to sell them here and just give nerd melt some money,
1364640	1370800	then let's do it. I don't care. I'm rich. All right. But I have a feeling we're not doing it
1370800	1375120	because it's hard and whoever had to sell them would not be getting paid. But if that's true,
1375120	1380800	pay yourself. I don't care. I won't notice. I'm rich. I have people. I pay people to manage my
1380800	1384400	money. Surely, I hope they're stealing from me. If they're not, they should be.
1387360	1389520	I have the same accountant, so I hope that's not true.
1389520	1393520	Well, I wouldn't have them steal from you. It's fine. And I'm sure you keep a tight,
1393520	1397840	tight, you know, before you get out your little Scrooge specs at the end of the night, your whale
1397840	1409600	oil lamp. I don't know why that's so funny. So go to Hiramandtown.com. You can buy a t-shirt.
1409600	1415760	It's extra cheap right now. We made a lot of t-shirts and I guess we didn't know no one would
1415760	1422960	want them. So our bad judgment is your gain. That's capitalism. That's how it works. Everything
1422960	1433840	must go because nothing should have been. It's called supply and lack of demand, I think,
1433840	1444320	is the principle there. Speaking of capitalism, I think now... No, don't waste a segue that good.
1444320	1452880	It's almost top. Speaking of value, head on down to Hiramandtown.com.
1454080	1459520	Wasn't that fucking sweet? I was like Paul Harvey in the old days, like Jack Benny or something.
1462080	1467440	Okay. So no, I was... You know what I was going to say is I want to get like a dickhead car.
1468960	1472480	I've been driving a Prius for like... I can't even remember. I was like the first car I ever
1472480	1479680	bought new. What's your shame aside, self-consciousness aside, what would be the ultimate dickhead car?
1479680	1486720	Tesla. I want to get one of these Teslas. So you hear that response because it's a Reddit favorite,
1486720	1490880	this car. Like people just sit on Reddit and they just watch videos of this car.
1492000	1497600	But they're really fast. Do you want a fast car? You don't strike me as a fast car type of guy.
1497600	1501440	If it's fast enough so we can get away, maybe we can make a deal.
1503200	1507200	Leave tonight, live and die this way. It's a Tracy Chapman song.
1510560	1515440	I've never felt so old and alone. I got so excited when he said it. You want a fast car?
1520960	1524560	And then it didn't matter. I could have taken forever with it. I thought everyone was gonna go,
1524560	1531280	fast car! It's like back in the 90s whenever you said who you're gonna call or anything close to it.
1537280	1541440	I know that song, but what it sounded like to me is a conversation you would have if somebody was
1541440	1545280	asking you if you would help them rob a bank. Well yeah, I don't know what that song... I mean,
1545280	1549200	I guess she's poor and she's talking to some guy. It's like a romance story. It's a little tragic
1549200	1555920	urban slice of life. It's like a hard-on-our-luck girl who's taking care of her alcoholic dad and
1555920	1563120	she's singing to some guy that has a fast car. I don't know why she thinks that the speed of the
1563120	1567520	car matters. I think that she seems like a smart person listening to her sing. She's very in touch
1567520	1574800	with her emotions. She's no doubt cognitive. I mean, who cares how fast you leave a city?
1574800	1581280	I mean, it's not like urban plight. It's like a tornado in a Bruckheimer movie. It's not like
1581280	1589280	chasing you. There's no escape velocity. Yeah, thank you. It's not like at the end of ID4 when
1589280	1596480	the fat lady hasn't sung yet. He can't speed out of something. It's not like Return of the Jedi
1596480	1601600	when you're maneuvering the... I think it's metaphorical. Is it fast enough so I can get...
1601600	1609120	Is it fast enough so I can forget? So I can break free. Yeah, I know.
1612640	1616720	She's walking a tightrope. A lot of people listening to that song aren't as bright.
1616720	1621360	They're going to be like, who cares how fast your car is. Just get on the bus.
1621360	1633040	You got a bus ticket. I got a transfer and a duffel bag. So we could save a lot of money.
1633040	1636800	Sell your fast car and get three bus tickets. We'll take your dog.
1639360	1644960	That's like, you know, it's just a workshop at a little lady. Keep brainstorming.
1645600	1648960	So you want to get a Tesla? I want to get a Tesla. Okay, so those of you who don't know,
1648960	1654960	it's like this crazy nerd car. It's purely electric, but it's a luxury sedan.
1660240	1665120	All the reasons you're not supposed to get a car. All the things that aren't supposed to
1665120	1671840	make you want to get a car. The 12-year-old in you. It has these door handles that
1672400	1676800	are flush with the body. And when you reach for the door, the handle comes out.
1679120	1687280	It has a screen in it so big that I don't even know what to tell you.
1688960	1694240	You can watch like Yo Jimbo on it? Yeah, you could watch like The Little Mermaid on it and
1694240	1705200	See Cleavage. I'm sorry that popped out of my head. Use your own standards for defining resolution
1705200	1713520	of a TV screen. Don't go by me. How much is one of these running? Do you know the sticker price?
1714720	1718560	It's a couple hundred grand. I don't know if it's a hundred grand or 200 grand. It's like,
1718560	1722240	you know, it's more than you should ever spend in a car because cars don't gain value, real estate,
1722240	1727920	hey, whatever, buy gold, buy a puppy, you know, these things appreciate. Puppies after 10 years,
1727920	1738000	boy, the resale on those puppies. You know, have you seen puppy flippers on Bravo? It's amazing.
1738000	1745440	Like these guys are sharks and they just boom, boom, boom. Pimp my puppy. They buy a puppy,
1745440	1753840	they pimp it, they flip it. Puppy pimping flippers. Right after Push Smashers. Oh shit.
1753840	1757280	I'm fine. Smush Smush Smushers.
1761760	1764960	Back bracers. Back brace dynasty.
1767920	1773120	On an all new season of back brace dynasty, Adam Goldberg smashes some puss.
1775440	1776640	You can't sit here.
1784080	1787680	I don't care where in the blip you think I can sit. Mother blip, you gotta,
1787680	1793440	you tell her I'm gonna sit here. Monica has lost her mind. On an all new puss back bracer,
1793440	1800560	smasher pussers. After that, duck, duck, duck, duck people.
1802320	1807360	Guys that work for ducks. Aquarium masters.
1807520	1816000	Carpet munchers. You knew that was, you got all excited. You don't know Tracy Chapman lyrics,
1816000	1822080	but you, I know it's where the wind blows. You know where your brunch butter.
1825680	1831440	All right. I walked the line with some cupcakes and I apologize if you were at the back of the
1831440	1834720	line. It's hard to be the back of the line, but that does mean that you didn't have to wait in
1834720	1840720	line as long as the people in front of the line. Erin McGathey, who has gone cake crazy. It is
1840720	1848240	clearly a more than welcome misdirection and projection of some kind of uterine energy that
1848240	1854240	she's, she's living with me now. We got a puppy. She's making a million cakes a day. I know what
1854240	1861520	this means and I'm fine with it, but she made like a thousand cupcakes and we handed them out
1861920	1869120	in line. And while I was out there, a gentleman named Lars said that he had brought something
1869120	1875520	to share with the audience and that it wasn't a bag of rocks, which is a reference to our lost
1875520	1882480	episode actually. Hello Lars. Hi. So yeah, last week Bill brought rocks, which I thought was a
1882480	1892000	cool souvenir, but not the coolest thing exactly. So no, I thought it was good. Lars, but before
1892000	1895760	you, before you reveal it, I can, we have to describe that you're holding a very mysterious
1895760	1901840	leather sack right now. I wanted to keep it quiet. So I made the sack for it, but no, the rocks were
1901840	1906400	a good idea. It was a nice souvenir, but they were rocks. So I brought a bag of polyhedral dice.
1907040	1911280	Wait, what are they? Polyhedral dice. Polyhedral dice. Oh, it's just, you just brought a bunch of
1911280	1917520	dice. Yeah. Dungeons and Dragons dice. Oh, on the rise. There's about a numbers on them. Yes. They're rocks with numbers.
1919680	1925440	Bill, a passive aggressive Bill went from the audience. Oh, they're rocks with numbers on them.
1926480	1932720	That was pretty aggressively aggressive. There's about a hundred in there. So there's
1932720	1936240	probably just about enough for everybody to grab one. They are, they're different. They're different.
1936240	1940560	They're not all 20 sided there. There's some tens and some eights and some, probably some fours in
1940560	1944560	there. Fantastic. Yep. All right. Well, thank you, Lars. I have one complete set if you want to give
1944560	1950320	that away to someone or something. You know what, Lars? I'd like to present you with a cup. No, that
1950320	1959680	wouldn't make sense. Well, let's give them to Adam Goldberg because we made a lot of pay out of his
1959680	1974400	misery. All right. Thank you, Lars. I feel that, I was going to say, I feel that Adam's back brace
1974400	1978480	is just him slowly walking us toward him, coming in here strapped with explosives. So we're not
1978480	1986160	going to know when it happened. We're just going to stop patting him down visually. We've seen him
1986160	1989840	wearing something that you could not get on a plane with. Oh my gosh. Thank you, Lars. These are
1989840	1995200	great. Now he's holding a thumb up. Is that the joke you were doing? Oh, I thought you were holding
1995200	2002080	a thumb up to further wean us into the idea that he's a detonator in his hand. It's great. It's
2002080	2011760	great. There's that back brace guy that's always voting his approval on things. You can't sit there.
2011760	2026080	Everybody sits over here by the wall. Gather around. What do you think, Jeff? You've done
2026080	2032240	more shows than me in your life. The bag of rocks I thought turned out to, the dispensation of them
2032240	2036640	seemed to take some energy out of the room. It was noisy and time consuming. But again, I like the
2037120	2042000	rocks. It was a lovely token. No, I'm just saying as a crowd control thing, is it okay to handle
2042000	2046720	leather sacks? For instance, that lady in the front. Are you passing out these dice? Yeah,
2046720	2050240	well, yeah. He brought them first so that everyone could take a die. Oh, really? Is it for everybody?
2050240	2054560	Yeah, there's like a hundred of them in here. So probably won't everybody get one. Probably won't
2054560	2064720	everybody get one. But I reckon if you take your fail, we'll have also a good time. It's a nice
2064720	2069600	soft leather pouch. That should mute the idea. I think Laura's thought of everything in this camp.
2069600	2074000	Well, let's try it. All right. The dice are being passed about. So hopefully people in the back,
2075120	2078320	they'll be some nice. It's a little die that you could you could you could do anything with that.
2078320	2084320	Put it on your shelf at home and you know, put it put it put it between your R2-D2 pencil sharpener
2084320	2093120	and that photo of your dad with the eyes cut out. Or the or the Sears underwear model you you pretend
2093120	2100400	is your dad because your mom told you he was a lion tamer and he was never around. So you just
2100400	2105840	picked a guy from a magazine and used to worship him. But then when you turn 15, you're like,
2105840	2117600	fuck this guy or or make a necklace out of it. What are you bringing then to this fifth
2117600	2121440	season of community? Well, what emotionally, what can I watch the fourth season first? But I mean,
2121440	2127040	I and everyone keeps saying, you know what you got to do. And I know you can finish this along
2127040	2131440	with me. You should you should have Abed come out of the box that you put him in, which I did. I did.
2131440	2135760	I kind of was thinking that at the end of season three, I was like, I got a feeling this shit's
2135760	2140880	gonna hit the fan. Let's let's let's put let's put the let's put the weird guy in the box and
2140880	2147280	have a bright light flash so that just in case, just just in the weirdest case like scenario where
2147280	2153600	if I don't come back and then an even weirder case, a much weirder case, I come back for a fifth
2153600	2161920	season, you could just have him come out of the box and then go lame. And then just get started
2161920	2166720	with a with a with a fourth season of community. But you already all thought of that. I've seen
2166720	2171600	you online saying that and it sounds to me and I can say this now because I haven't seen the fourth
2171600	2174560	season. So I'm just saying from reading the reviews, which was very healthy of me,
2175280	2181760	that that if there was a complaint among fans, and this is kind of ironic and something to learn a
2181760	2187520	lesson from, I don't know what that there was a the word fan fiction keeps coming up like a kind of
2188080	2194480	there was a what Gina Davis and the fly would call a synthetic kind of going through the motions
2194480	2200400	sort of this is what community is. So here it is for you served up on a platter and and and you
2200400	2208000	know that the the I think that in a world where everybody says that and everybody says you should
2208000	2212800	pretend for a season was a dream. And then if I did that, then we're just continuing the cycle
2212800	2219120	of abuse, aren't we? So the fifth season needs to definitely be a kind of emotional spiritual
2219120	2225200	reboot, you know, right? It needs to get get back to some kind of basics. I'm gonna I'm gonna bring
2225200	2232880	the monkey back I mentioned, but probably three more three more monkeys. That's the short answer,
2232880	2238240	just more monkeys, as I've pointed out, and I'm gonna have a doctor with a face in his hands,
2239840	2243360	the back of his hands. I want to see that talking mop come on the show.
2246240	2250720	I could carve myself out a little part, couldn't I? They can't fire me for anything now. So I could,
2250800	2255120	I could just be like, well, here's, here's Uncle Bill. Like, like, like, could you be like that,
2255120	2261440	like the Phantom of the Opera? Like, each episode begins with me like up in an attic going, oh boy,
2261440	2268480	I've been up here for a while. Oh, and he's had a lot of adventures. And like, just just just like
2268480	2274640	ruin it, just crash it into the ocean. Just like, like, like chum the water. Or do like an Andy Rooney,
2274640	2278480	like just to camera ending every time. Just like you look to camera and say what you learn. Well,
2278480	2284080	I could be like Rod Serling come out at the beginning and end of every episode. It's kind
2284080	2291680	of like, wow, this looks like it's going to be a good one. Looks like they're doing another bottle
2291680	2297760	episode. Must have broke the bank on the one before it. It all comes out in the wash here at
2297760	2301360	the Harmon Zone. That was pretty badass in Twilight Zone for hitting, for the creator of the show,
2301360	2307600	just to enter the cockpit of the plane. Smoking. The guys are flying a plane. There's dinosaurs
2307600	2316400	outside and Rod Serling just enters to the side of the plane and goes, holy shit. Not only did I
2316400	2323440	just walk in through the side of a moving plane, but I wrote this. I wrote this. And I'm here to
2323440	2327920	tell you, if you're not here when giving the commercials over, you're going to blow my fucking
2327920	2333840	mind because there's dinosaurs outside this plane. Rod Serling was super badass, by the way. Very
2333840	2342800	angry, very outraged about the blacklisting and stuff. He fucking ground heavy duty Paul Bunyan
2342800	2350960	sized axes. He was a creative guy that wanted the audience to be happy and knew that McCarthyism
2350960	2359040	was bullshit and that the government could suck his smoking dick. He just came out there and just
2359040	2364880	thinly veiled a million metaphors for it, considered for your approval. This lady thinks
2364880	2369280	she's awesome because she's rich, but she just got hit by a fucking car in the Twilight Zone.
2370000	2380400	Pea suit. He was mad. You know he went home and gave it to his wife, hard. So much harder than me.
2382160	2386800	I can't even, I can't, I just, I just, ugh, I have it. So he says something on a conference call
2386800	2393120	and I'm just like, I'm sorry, Aaron, I can't. I can't, I can't. Are you saying that when
2393120	2397600	Sony, when you could have a conference call that you cannot smash puss? I cannot. I can, I can, I
2397600	2407520	could maybe move it around a little. Like a, like a, like a croquet ball. Just knock it around the
2407520	2415440	yard. I can't smash it, you know. But you know Rod Serling. Rod Serling came home. You know,
2415520	2422960	you know Amanda Serling was a happy woman. And I'm not saying like, even though it was the 50s,
2422960	2428240	it wasn't or 60s or whatever the hell it was, there were dinosaurs outside the plane. So I
2428240	2434240	don't know if it was, I bet she, I bet she was an activated woman too. I bet she, I bet she was not
2434240	2439520	like wearing a string of pearls in the kitchen and making him roast. I bet, I bet she, I bet she,
2439600	2449600	I bet she designed jigsaw puzzles or, or, or, or wrote, wrote novels even. Wow. Yeah. You're being,
2449600	2454240	you're being very generous with made up Amanda Serling. It's the, it's the, it was the 50s. So
2454240	2459280	you have to adjust for cultural inflation and say that would be pretty, you see madmen, you know how
2459280	2465120	weird it is when a woman does something. You know the way it was back then. It's not my fault,
2465120	2468640	but Rod Serling probably didn't put up with it. He probably came home and she was probably like,
2468640	2473680	she was probably wrenching on the car. And he was like, I wish that car was my dick.
2475680	2479600	And then she was like, maybe it is. And he's like, you're right. Anything's possible.
2480240	2483840	Fucking Rod Serling. That's probably where he got half his ideas, this weird sexual
2483840	2488560	games that they would play. She'd like tie him to the bed and like, like, go like,
2488560	2492400	what if I had a pig face when you woke up and he'd be like, fucking a, I'd come like a bucket.
2492400	2499920	I got to write this down. You know what, Amanda, write it down for me. I'll put my name on it.
2499920	2506400	Because of course we can't allow you to work in the industry, but your words will reach America.
2506400	2513520	Tonight, Rod, when you come home, I want you to imagine that my pussy is dinosaur land and that
2513520	2520560	your dick is a lost 747. Yes. Yes. Carining headlong into the past. Yeah.
2523360	2527840	Submitted for your approval every night. Yes.
2529760	2535040	Submit it to me. Submit it to me. I think I figure I'm going to, you know what, I'm going to put
2535040	2539360	Sony out of my mind. I'm going to go home tonight and I'm going to get dressed up like Rod Serling
2539360	2548320	and I'm going to give it to Erin. I'm going to take up smoking again and get upset about fear of
2548320	2560800	communism. I mean, we may not have to cut the show short. Just like I got a little diamond down
2560800	2568160	here. Just thinking about it. Really? No. I just can't think of what to do next. Let's just, uh,
2568160	2571120	let's, uh, you refer to your hard penis as a little diamond.
2571840	2578480	I'm never, I'm never going to pretend I'm hung like a moose. That's not, you can tell from my
2578480	2582960	work that I'm dealing with something. You're hung like a, like a window at Tiffany's.
2584960	2590240	It's sparkly. I make up, I make up for a little lack of size. The clarity, the clarity.
2593600	2598000	And, and you could use my dick to like break into a house in a 70s heist movie.
2598640	2603120	So we get you so turned on, we just hold you up to a window and turn me in a circle.
2605440	2607840	Then James Khan just reaches through and opens the door.
2610880	2612640	Thank you, Dan. You're welcome, James Khan.
2614560	2619680	Sorry, I couldn't do it. I know your dick's too big, Mr. Khan. You don't have a little diamond.
2622320	2624880	Heroes coming all sizes, Dan. Thank you, Mr. Khan.
2628560	2631840	But then he gets mad that you use his name in the robbery. Then he has to kill you.
2631840	2635760	Stop breaking the fourth wall, Harmon. Sorry, Mr. Khan.
2637920	2643280	Your character's name is Scorpius in this 70s heist movie. Wouldn't you be worried though,
2643280	2646480	that in the third act, he finally realizes that instead of breaking into stealing things,
2646480	2650960	he should just be smuggling your dick. He should, he should, he should heist your, your diamond dick.
2652560	2656400	And then you wake up and it's just a little note to where your dick used to be.
2658240	2663200	And it says, uh, uh, I got your dick and it's just a picture of him on a speedboat.
2664960	2668560	Wait, did he leave the picture of him on a speedboat? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So no, it's a picture of
2668560	2673280	the Polaroid of him, like, and he's got like, he's got like a big giant briefcase full of money.
2673920	2680080	And the world's longest tripod. Is that like, like, what? He had someone, he could afford with
2680080	2684800	the money from the dick. By the time, by the time you read this, I will have hired Julio to stand
2684800	2691040	on the shore of Cabo San Lucas with a Polaroid camera with instructions to mail this to you and
2691040	2696560	place it on where your dick used to be. And then kill himself because no loose ends. No, no loose
2696560	2703280	ends. That's the name of the movie. It's, and it's just the poster is just a picture of a diamond
2703280	2710720	and like a high heel shoe. And, uh, and like, uh, it should be, it should be a guy with like a
2710720	2716720	magnifying glass up to his dick. Like, I got an inspector using a, uh, maybe call the movie
2716720	2723360	spoilers. I don't know. Diamond dick? No, I think, I think that's something you want to discover in
2723360	2729120	the movie. I think let's not argue about it. We're having fun tonight. Uh, let's, uh, let's, let's,
2729120	2733440	let's play some Dungeons and Dragons unless there's any more business to attend to. Let's get to it.
2733440	2737680	Let's bring up Kameo Nanjiani and, uh, Eric McGathey to the stage.
2744800	2750080	Hello. I'm sorry it's become the tradition that I talk for an hour and then bring you guys up,
2750080	2754960	but I, I, I, I always, I always want to bring you guys up earlier. Can I make a couple comments on
2754960	2761040	things you've said? Yes, you can. Okay. One, the shirt, the Harmon town shirt is it's so,
2761680	2767120	for some reason, the way it feels on me, it feels like it's amazing. It feels like I'm in the womb.
2767120	2774160	It is really soft. It's so soft. I actually tried, I looked up the label and I ordered just regular
2774160	2780800	plain t-shirts from Amazon of that type. I don't know why that's funny already. I think that, I
2780800	2786080	think, well, I was, because it sounded for a second, like you had engaged in an elaborate
2786080	2793520	attempt to pirate my shirts. No, clearly I'm like terrible at, at like figuring out what the demand
2793520	2801120	is because clearly there's a ton of them sitting around, but so I ordered it and it was not as good
2801120	2807600	as the one. So somehow the printing process of you guys's faces on it, huh, makes it really
2807600	2813280	comfortable. Also it's made in Honduras, I saw, and I, my prediction is Honduras is going to
2813280	2818480	fucking take off pretty soon because they're sitting on a goldmine of like perfect t-shirts.
2820800	2822560	What are the Honduras? Are those islands?
2823440	2829120	Nobody knows. There's no way to know. I wish there was some way to figure it out. There's no way.
2829120	2835040	I believe the Honduras is actually a country. But it's not, so there's not multiple Honduras.
2837360	2841920	Yeah, there's Honduras and Honduras is all of them. But you guys know when you go there,
2842000	2847840	don't go to the Big Island. You got to go to Hondorito. It's, people look at it, I'm
2847840	2853920	happy to go, let's go to the Big Island. Don't, it's so touristy. It's a Hawaii joke, I guess.
2854480	2859360	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I lost my crowd with the Tracy Chapman reverence and of course the
2859360	2865920	upper tax bracket Hawaii humor. You know, the joke when you're going on vacation in Hawaii,
2865920	2869120	like, dude, I just ate peanut butter on ramen tonight.
2869120	2876000	Yeah, you have to be like a showrunner of a season five show to get the joke he just made.
2876000	2881120	Yeah, it's, yeah, you gotta, I hope if you have to, you have to, you have to hit 88 miles per hour
2881680	2887920	in a Tesla, then the humor can actually like soak into your.
2887920	2890800	Just why don't you explain to them what the Hawaiian islands are, just so they,
2890800	2895360	so we all know exactly. Well, there's a, there's a big one you're not supposed to go to.
2896240	2899440	That's, that's, that's the big conversation. People go, you're going to Hawaii, which island
2899440	2902560	are you going to? And then they go, don't go to the big one. I think the big one's actually
2902560	2907200	called Hawaii. How many islands are there on the chain? Well, isn't there like a bazillion,
2907200	2914960	but there's like three main ones. There's Kauai and Maui. Why are you doing this? I just like,
2914960	2917920	you have this smug look in your face. Like, like, like, you're either going to reveal
2917920	2921120	that I don't know a lot about Hawaii or how much I do. I thought you were just going to make up
2921120	2926400	false Hawaii. Oh, oh, oh, oh, more bad improv. He's doing you a favor. He's making you seem less
2926400	2933520	rich because you know less about Hawaii. Right. Right. That would make me seem likable if I,
2933520	2937600	if I went there all the time and didn't give a fuck about it was like, do you go there all the time?
2939040	2943120	Have you been actually, what is Honolulu, one of the islands?
2944880	2949360	Isn't it? No, that's a city. Honolulu is a city on one of the islands.
2949920	2955520	Probably, probably Hawaii. Nope. We're just guessing at facts about what is it, a state?
2955520	2960880	I don't know. Oh, it's a state. It's also an archipelago.
2964960	2968640	The other thing I wanted to bring up is that Jason Alexander, Google him.
2968640	2976400	Now he has a shamelessly full head of hair. He has a full head of hair. It's fucking crazy.
2976400	2983120	It's a miracle. Yeah, he just drank a lot of coffee one night. He was really bald for a long
2983120	2989920	time. Yeah. Wow. May I address something? Yes. You meant you referred to your, to your erect penis
2989920	2992880	as little dino. Diamonds. Oh, diamonds.
2995920	3000480	Oh, God damn it. Please, please, everyone go back in time and don't, don't correct her. I want to
3000480	3005520	know what the rest of her thought was going to be. Yes. Yes, sweetie. We did a 10 minute sketch about
3005520	3013360	diamonds as dicks. Sweetie, what? Yes. I was kind of in and out. I can connect the dots. Dinosaurs
3013360	3017920	died, became fossilized, coal became diamonds. Go ahead. But what were you going to say? I missed
3017920	3021760	her. I could have already said dino. I heard of him. Well, the reason why is because of our dog.
3021760	3029520	I have our dog on the mind and his toy is his little dino. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Weird.
3030960	3034240	Well, not if that guy was just the first to think of my dick in a dog's mouth.
3035200	3041280	Well, yeah. Certainly he is not the first person to think that. I was kind of like how, I mean,
3041280	3045520	it's kind of when you're sitting in the bed, Dustin's got the, got the good seat back there.
3045520	3050720	When you're further back, it's harder to, to, to hear. To, to, to respect me.
3052480	3056560	Once I'm out of a certain radius and I'm like, whoa, whoa, why did I feel that way? And then I
3056560	3061760	come a little bit closer and I'm like, I think some of your hair just got transferred to Jason
3061840	3067280	Alexander. He's stealing it. I kept in half listening for you to say like, which is so
3067280	3070960	funny because my dog's toy, I've become the most boring person in the world. Like I'm just thinking
3070960	3079360	about the dog's toys and guys, we got a dog. Have you ever pet a dog before? We went, we went, we
3079360	3087840	took it to its first class at puppy kindergarten today. That was a mix of Oz and the curriculum
3087840	3093520	at puppy kindergarten today. It's all people talking about Hawaii today. We literally
3095840	3100720	is the exact same which island, which island, not the big one. Like that's where the poor people go.
3100720	3105440	They see it. They see it's a big island. They go, let's go to the big island. Go to the littlest one.
3107520	3116560	It's made of cocaine. The, the, the first class was, you, you, wait, there are different classes.
3116560	3121280	Yeah. And look, by the way, they're at an animal hospital and they're, they're really affordable.
3121280	3126560	The karma dog care. And I'm sure that I'm sure the money goes to do what we didn't do,
3126560	3130640	which is rescue dogs, right? Like, like, like I'm just saying, like, like, like it's not like a,
3130640	3137520	it's like out of that. It's run by James Con. Anyways, we did have to hold hands and make a
3137520	3142480	decision at the outset of all of this that we were going to be one of those couples. So we're
3142480	3146480	fine with it. So you can sit there and judge us in silence. We have a dog. We are a dog couple.
3146480	3150240	We're fucking doing putting the pedal to the metal. We went to puppy kindergarten today.
3150240	3153360	Did you say, oh, no, sorry. He said puddle. He said puddle. I thought,
3154320	3159040	man, we are putting our dick in a dog's mouth. What did you think I said? I thought,
3160000	3164560	I thought instead of pedal, you were going to say poodle. And then he just did the average of both.
3164560	3170320	Oh no. The pool to the metal? Pedal, pedal to the metal. At one point, the woman who was running the
3170320	3177760	class that Dan said that his name was Jan. I mean, I'm at puppy kindergarten. My name's probably not,
3178640	3188240	you know, Tony. What? I tried to think of the most manly name. I just tried to think of a super manly
3188240	3194480	name and then realized that why puppy kindergarten? Was that, is that just because we don't know what
3194480	3197760	we're doing and we're scared that we're going to do it wrong. And we're just, we're reading every book
3197760	3200160	and we're watching. It's like a socialization class. I mean, no matter what we say, it's going
3200160	3205040	to sound really silly, but it's at an animal hospital. It's our dog interacting with other
3205040	3210080	dogs and people telling us how cute our dog is. I like that you were making fun of animal practice
3210080	3216640	earlier. Meanwhile, that's kind of your life right now. Yeah, but I wouldn't expect more than 100,
3216640	3224560	150 people to be interested in it for free. Plus, I bet his doctor is not an actual monkey,
3224560	3228960	which I think was the premise of that show. Was the doctor a monkey? I don't know. I saw in the
3228960	3233360	poster. It looks like, it looks like the monkey is the star of the show. He's got a little stethoscope.
3233360	3238240	At the beginning of the show, a doctor gets cursed by an angry patient and he turns into a monkey.
3238240	3244480	Is that a Sony show too? The animal practice was that. I believe it is. I like to think like Jason
3244480	3252560	and Alexander directed a bunch of them. That's where he got most of the initial foundation of his
3252560	3260400	area. Yeah. I just like to think that they were like, when they were green lighting that show,
3260400	3266720	that they were like, fucking, fucking Harmon. You have a monkey on your show. Fucking use it right.
3268240	3272640	Is it the same monkey or a different monkey? Oh, this is, yeah, it's crystal, the hangover monkey.
3273600	3282800	You, you're starstruck. I am starstruck. So there's just like one great monkey in the world.
3283440	3289760	Yeah. No, you better believe it. Yeah. I, I crystal. How old is crystal? I don't know. By the way,
3289760	3295440	this is a weird fact. I found out this is true. You can look it up. Lobsters are immortal. They
3295440	3300560	only die if you kill them or if they get a disease, they would otherwise live forever. And I heard
3300640	3304960	there's a kind of jellyfish that is technically never has to die, but it eventually will bump into
3304960	3309120	enough things that it will die or we'll get eaten at some point. Maybe crystal is like a lobster in
3309120	3317680	disguise or like one of Jesus. I was caught up with the, cause the gesture you made that Jason
3317680	3323200	Alexander used to kill a man in college was a lobster kind of gesture. I'm just connecting
3323200	3330800	too many dots. This is like an episode of Twilight zone. Actually submitted for your board.
3330800	3336400	Are you, uh, are you worried about this, uh, this imminent plus smashing session that's going to go
3336400	3345600	on later on? Worried, excited, right? Girlfriend. I tell Camille everything about our sex life.
3345600	3348320	I mean, you have an hour to go back there. Should we, should we show?
3348400	3357200	Wait, hello. Sorry about my ringing noise. Hey, are you calling him in the 1890s?
3360960	3362480	Marjorie, go into the sitting room.
3366400	3371680	Hey, Camille. Oh, hey. Well, it was smashed again.
3371680	3378240	I don't know why me.
3381600	3385920	I, uh, I was, I was sitting at home. I was painting and he came in and he was telling me.
3385920	3390720	Oh, you paint? I always try and change the subject.
3393200	3397200	Yes, but more importantly, I painted my orgasms all over the walls of our bedroom.
3397840	3405360	Bedroom walls. Now what color is the, uh, it's pink. Oh, the walls are the, oh, of the house.
3406960	3413680	So you got, you bought a house. How are the, uh, mortgage, right? Uh,
3413680	3417360	what a market. I'm just, I'm just going to reenact the end of it.
3419440	3426080	Hey, that's when we found out my girlfriend doesn't know what an orgasm sounds like.
3428160	3430640	That's actually the most embarrassing thing that happened tonight.
3431920	3435440	And never shall. And never shall. Yeah. I mean,
3444560	3447680	All right, Camille. I'll call you in another month or so.
3449600	3453680	Every time he gets a haircut, all of a sudden he's Bill Pullman.
3453680	3460160	It's very telling that that's the most virile man you could think of.
3460960	3465200	It's either him or Tony. I don't know. Bill Pullman.
3467200	3473520	Uh, Spencer, you're awful quiet over there. Yeah, man. I don't know. I don't know. I just
3473520	3479200	haven't thought of a thing, a thing to say. Are you pros? A smashing post. Do you smash posts?
3479200	3482560	I, I've been known to smoosh a push.
3487920	3491040	You and me and Jeff got pretty, pretty, uh, toasty the other night.
3495120	3498480	Spencer and I had been threatening to go out and have a drink with each other.
3503200	3505200	Okay. Don't scare me like that.
3505200	3513840	I see, I see 9 11 every day twice a day. I look, I look at the clock ever since junior high
3513840	3518160	school. I see what's happening here is Dan hates the Jeff claims that he sees it on the clock all
3518160	3523200	the time. So now I see it more than anyone. And every time I do, I sarcastically pointed out,
3523200	3527920	but I'm just adding, adding to the list. You're making me see it now. I know. I know. I know.
3527920	3533440	That's, I, um, you win again. Wait, wait, this is, this is a problem you have that you don't like
3533440	3540160	that I say that I see that 11 all the time. Well, problem is a strong word. I just, I just,
3540160	3545680	I just don't, I don't believe in the, in the theory. I think it's not, it's, it's, it's bullshit.
3545680	3549600	Like I don't get to say this in the clock at certain times. I see 11 11 every day. You,
3549600	3554000	you just think you do. Cause that, that resonates for some reason. That must have been hard for you
3554000	3562640	to say. Wait, I let you say that I'm much more fascinating than I actually am. I thought you
3562720	3566720	believed in magic more than you did than, than you do. And then, and then something
3566720	3570880	about Al Qaeda's attack on the United States, like had a mystical. Oh, cause you've been,
3570880	3575120	you've been looking, you've been noticing that times in, since high school. Yeah. I always like,
3575120	3578480	for some reason I was like, if I would like get into a car and a clock and have a digital thing,
3578480	3582560	or you always see 9 11. We just like frequently. Is that where you picked that day?
3585200	3589040	You can't pin nothing on me. See, this is another last episode.
3589760	3598960	I'm on Dan's side with this, by the way. I don't have a big fucking hangup about it. I mentioned
3598960	3604320	that I used to see it a lot. And I frequently did. And then on 9 11, 9 11 happened. Well,
3605440	3609040	you were seeing it before 9 11 when I was, since I was a kid and you were just going,
3609040	3612800	oh, that's the number for emergency. Yeah. I would always see 9 11 happened.
3612800	3617120	I didn't really connect those dots until later. Yeah. But, but I, but you remember,
3617120	3621840	I had that crazy panic attack on the morning that all happened. I woke up.
3621840	3623520	Yeah. I was so rough for you that day.
3628960	3633440	I'm sorry. 9 11 really was your 9 11.
3634800	3638240	I will, I will treat your ass like a pussy and smash the hell out of it.
3639040	3646880	Oh, that's romantic. All right. Yeah. I'll orgasm all over these walls.
3648720	3651600	What color are your walls? Well, they will be pink.
3654880	3659440	I woke up like at 6am, which is around 9am. When the, when the, when the, when the shit hit the
3660320	3665120	planes hit the buildings, I woke up screaming and freaking out in my bed in LA. And I've never had
3665120	3670160	a panic attack in my life, but I woke up like just, just after 6am, uh, in my little apartment,
3670160	3674960	I used to live in then. And, uh, and I just started screaming at the top of my lungs and
3674960	3678960	bawling crying. And I didn't know why I was wide awake, but I felt like the walls were going to
3678960	3682800	fall in on me. And I kept looking at the walls. Like I was afraid that the walls in my place
3682800	3686720	were going to fall in and crush me. And then I realized that it wasn't me that was in danger.
3686720	3689920	It was a lot of people on the other side of the world that were really, really in danger.
3689920	3695680	And I was screaming for a half hour. Wait, you had a psychic. I'm not trying to be fun.
3695680	3701280	You had a psychic vision of 9 11. I have, I've had them all my life. I dream about, I'm not.
3701280	3705920	Why is this not every episode? Thank you, Camille.
3708560	3714080	Do you believe in magic? I mean, you got to talk about K9 kindergarten. Meanwhile,
3714080	3720080	ask yourself this question. What? Why is it? Why was he so put off by my insinuation that,
3720080	3724960	that he believed in magic? The power you have. It's revealed that you have a little bone to pick
3724960	3729840	up. You know what I really like? Does anyone wish they would fight less? You know what I like? I
3729840	3734000	like the idea of like a psychic who just doesn't have the confidence because his friends always
3734000	3741440	make it to like prevent horrible disasters. If I lived, if I lived in a little more supportive
3741440	3745840	environment, then maybe a lot of lives would be saved. There would not have been any 9 11.
3746720	3748400	You would have been like Mark Wahlberg.
3751120	3757840	The problem is the times, like I had, I have dreams, vivid dreams about things that happened
3757840	3762240	like, like within hours. Like there's no time to save. Like, or like I wake up and go,
3762240	3768400	I, I dreamt about the, the, the, the big, uh, when was it? 90 San Francisco earthquake.
3768960	3773600	I had a giant dream that I was walking around San Francisco and the little, uh, you know,
3773600	3776960	the houses that go up the thing, a little, uh, full house houses that go up the street.
3776960	3779120	And I was walking down the street with, with Whoopi Goldberg.
3780720	3783360	Naturally. And I'm walking down the road with Whoopi Goldberg. All of a sudden the ground
3783360	3788880	starts shaking up and all the houses fall into giant cracks in the ground and big fires go on.
3788880	3794080	And the next morning San Francisco earthquake. And, uh, I, I also, I like that you've just been
3794080	3799680	sitting on these. You're like a, now you're a bad guy. You could have, you could have prevented.
3799680	3804320	When I wake up in the morning at Trinitineon and like, so Rob, Rob's Rob called me after
3804320	3809520	I'd finally come out of my freak out on nine one, nine 11. And he's like, Hey, Jeff, uh,
3809520	3813200	turn on your TV. Uh, the white house got blown up. And uh, like he got it all wrong.
3814160	3818720	That was Rob's description up for those who have listened to you. We've relayed the events of nine
3818720	3822240	11 from our own perspective. And one of them was that Rob called me at like whenever it was
3822240	3828720	happening. And this is how Rob's Rob describes nine 11 happening on the phone. Uh, I have to
3828720	3834560	back off the mic because this is, this is how loud Cheryl Rob was and said, Jesus fucking Christ,
3834560	3839120	turn on the TV. The fucking world's blowing up. The white house blew up. The Pentagon blew up.
3839120	3845360	The world trade center blew up fucking missiles flying out of the sky. And then Jeff is like,
3845360	3851840	I knew it. Yeah. Yeah. Jeff's like that explains that. That explains why I didn't
3851840	3857440	have another dream about San Francisco. Well, I, I had one dream one day. I woke up one morning
3857440	3861600	and got out of bed and I remembered this dream that I just had. And I was like, it was really
3861600	3866480	vivid. And I was like, okay, that fucking happened because that's, that felt like one of those ones.
3866480	3870960	It felt like this one happened. And so there's a feeling to the ones that are real. Otherwise
3871040	3873440	it would be like, Oh, there's going to be a big peanut butter dog.
3875760	3881040	Every morning, there's going to be, I'm going to be naked outside.
3882400	3884400	I'm going to, I'm going to take the old sats again.
3885040	3888480	Every single day, but she wasn't really my mom, but she was.
3889360	3891600	That's your curse is that every dream feels
3892480	3895520	prophetic. If that were true, then I would have felt like today I was going to wake up.
3895520	3899360	And I would have gone deep sea diving with Stuart Copeland from, from, from, uh, police.
3900240	3902800	Uh, that's, that's also did the theme to the equalizer.
3906080	3908320	Sorry. Go ahead. This felt real.
3908320	3911520	I had a dream and I woke up and I was washing my hands in the morning. I look in the mirror
3911520	3915600	and I have this thing like, Oh fuck that thing happened. I guarantee it. And so I don't, I just
3915600	3919920	like the dead zone. And so I go out to meet my brother for lunch and he lives. I drove out to
3919920	3924000	Venice where he lives, uh, by the beach and I pick him up and he's like, is this one of those
3924000	3927920	of your brothers been dead for 20 years stories? Cause I want to be emotionally ready for this.
3930320	3935360	He had to find out from, from a train conductor for some reason, your brother's been dead for 20
3935360	3939200	years. Take it. So he goes, he goes, he goes, she goes, did you, are you watching this thing
3939200	3943200	that's happening right now about this, uh, this, this Chechnya and, uh, hostage thing happening
3943200	3946640	in this theater in Russia right now? I'm like, what else are you getting like real specific?
3946640	3949840	Well, I had a dream that there was that thing where a bunch of people were held hostage in a
3949840	3954320	theater and the police came in and there was a standoff and they put, they, they gassed the
3954320	3959120	place and they killed all the people too. They killed the terrorists and the hostages all
3959440	3963280	as one because they put too much gas in there or something like that. And there was one American
3963280	3968640	that died in that thing. Is that how you can connect? That's your side. If there's one American,
3968640	3973120	then you have a link to it. I had a dream and I woke up that morning. I had a dream that I was in,
3973120	3977360	I was in a theater and I was like in the lobby of a theater and we're all waiting to go into the,
3977360	3980480	to the, to the seated part of the theater. We're in the lobby and there's a bunch of people and
3980480	3985360	everybody's speaking a different European language. It's all European and, and I'm lost and I don't
3985360	3989600	know where I am. All of a sudden they're screaming from the outside and gunfire and everybody starts
3989600	3994880	running into the theater, like into the seated part and hiding. And I just, I duck under a table.
3994880	3999920	Why is this not every episode? I duck under a table, hold onto a guy's leg. And he looks like
3999920	4004320	in my, like the image of this guy in my dream, he looked like a big caustic, like with a big
4004320	4011680	flowing pants and the big curvy sword and the big, a scimitar. Go ahead. But he also had an AK-47,
4011680	4018800	like a Russian. Uh-huh, head to your bets. You don't know what the vibe of the fight is going to be.
4018800	4021600	You don't know what the vibe of the fight is going to be. He looked like a, he looked like a caustic,
4021600	4026320	basically. And on the outside, you don't want to bring a cemetery to an AK-47 fight. Exactly.
4026320	4030560	That's not the Chicago way. No. But there was, there was a guy's all dressed in black,
4030560	4033760	like paramilitary people running around the outside and I could see him running around by
4033760	4037360	windows. And I didn't know if this guy was on my side or not, but I tug on his pants. I'm hiding
4037360	4041920	on her table and he's standing there with his gun out. And I, and I see like these paramilitary
4041920	4046720	guys run by a window and I see they're coming toward a door at like in the lobby area. And I
4046720	4051600	tug his leg, I point at that door and they come in and they're all in black, like paramilitary.
4051600	4055920	And he shoots them all. And then I wake up and I was, I remember early in the dream that I was
4055920	4060880	the only American in this room and all this stuff. But like, like, Oh, you were the guy that died.
4060880	4070720	I'm having a very difficult time with this, Jeff. I mean, shouldn't he sleep more often?
4070720	4076960	Well, don't you owe it to the people of the world? You should be just taking Xanax,
4076960	4082080	like a, like a precog, like you should be sleeping in a hot tub. You know what? If you don't, yeah,
4082080	4086960	you should be in a hot tub all the time. Go to Dan's house. I've been saying this for years.
4086960	4092640	It's not a hard note to take. I mean, like you, like every time you're awake, like right now,
4092640	4096800	you're like kind of killing people because somewhere you really are. What I like is that
4096800	4103760	God picked you and he's like, Oh, I fucked up picking this guy. He's so hungover.
4103760	4106240	And you're running on to the stage in a, in propaganda.
4106240	4107920	Yeah, you're not getting a problem.
4109360	4112400	I had a dream that 14 women were ripped in a cellar. Hey, everybody.
4112400	4116480	Hey, welcome. Can I get a suggestion of a farm noise?
4119280	4121200	I did just using it for your improv.
4125920	4129200	God's like, man, all right. I fucked up.
4130640	4132800	Jeff, your improv is really rape centric.
4134240	4135440	You brought up rape, not me.
4136880	4140000	It would be awesome if there was somebody in the audience, like, I think I might see Jeff doing
4140000	4147520	improv the next day. It's in the news. I mean, I mean, it's never particularly,
4147520	4152960	it's always pretty grim scene work. No, it's not like, Oh, hangover two did better than expected.
4152960	4157280	You know, there's a lot of comics that like, like, like, you know, you're laughing on the way home
4157280	4161680	because they're geniuses. It's like, like his improv shows are like, you kind of sit there
4161680	4165360	in an uncomfortable, puzzled silence, but the next morning you're like,
4166080	4174240	Oh, fuck. Why is this not like, I've known you for like a year.
4174240	4178000	But I've had a bunch like, there'll be times when I'll wake up and I'll have a dream and I'll go,
4178000	4183200	I'll just get online and I'll look and I'll just type in backyard helicopter crash. It'll be just
4183200	4187680	like my dreams. There'll be a picture. There's exactly the amount of people that got hurt or the
4187680	4191520	thing that happened or if nobody got hurt, they just say, I'll just type in, I'll Google some of
4191600	4195440	the shit that happens in my dreams. And there's an image of it. By the way,
4195440	4197040	four people dead tonight. I'll do the audience tonight.
4200560	4208080	That's the day was guaranteed. Only the Americans. Yeah. Only the Americans count.
4208080	4212160	That is amazing. How long has this been? It doesn't happen as much as it used to,
4212160	4216960	but if you ever have a dream where I'm in it and something shitty happens to me,
4216960	4223680	give me a fucking call, dude. Don't, don't catch near me. But he doesn't have time. He wakes up and
4223680	4228400	it happened. It didn't. That's why I'm saying he should be asleep all the time and people
4228400	4232880	should wake him up every two hours and, and, and just, and, you know, he'll always be pissed,
4232880	4239920	but it's the least he can do for literally the world. Just wake him up. He's always,
4239920	4244480	he's always cranky. You know, just checking like anything. It's like, I don't know,
4244480	4252880	marshmallows, crocodiles. Google it. Go to the Everglades. Go to every campsite.
4252880	4259680	Everglades. I'm like, I'm like sleepy, sleepy Lassie, sleepy Lassie. That's cute.
4259680	4265680	That is amazing. Jeff. So what do you think is going on? I don't know. I, I, I feel like it's,
4265680	4270240	um, like I used to have, uh, constantly deja vu's like every day. The only thing,
4270240	4275840	this is where I am right now. Cause I'm like very like, um, you know, science and all of that.
4279840	4282960	Is that how you work that scientifically? I'm like just a science guy, you know?
4284240	4288960	This is what I'm saying. I have two options right now. Cause I, I really, you know, we're like,
4288960	4292640	we're friends and you're like a very normal grounded guy. I have to either believe
4292640	4296880	that you're a little bit crazy or that everything I know is lies.
4297600	4303760	Those are my two options right now. I, I feel like, like I used to have deja vu's all the time.
4303760	4308640	I'd walk into a room and I would, I would literally like go into like a, like a restaurant
4308640	4313840	and I would be like, so it was a deja vu's happening. Like, but I'd be a little ahead of it.
4313840	4317840	And I go, that glass is going to fall off that table. And it would fall off the table. And I
4317840	4321520	go, and there's going to be a fight in like 10 seconds and then over and under. You're like in
4321520	4326000	groundhog day. Yeah. But like, but they say that's like a thing where it's like, uh,
4326000	4329440	it's like some people say deja vu is an iron deficiency where brain synapses
4332000	4336800	brain synapses are firing twice, but it fired once and you store something as a memory that
4336800	4340960	you don't remember where it's from. So it feels like a, like a distant memory, but it's all kind
4340960	4344800	of happening at once. But so you're kind of double firing at once. So your brain is kind of,
4344800	4348400	kind of lying. I used to walk into places and go like, we have to get out of here right now.
4348400	4352880	Like why? Because bad shit's about to happen and bad shit would happen in there. Like, I don't
4352880	4358880	like what's about to happen. It's like final destination. I haven't seen that. Don't you know
4358880	4371280	what it's about already? Oh my God. Wow. I just got that. That's amazing. What do you think of it,
4371280	4377360	Dan? Uh, your joke. I was fucking great. I laughed. I just, it took me a while. 40. The joke is great,
4377360	4383760	but I, I, look, I, I am, look, here's, can we, can we retrace our steps here?
4384480	4389200	I did a call back to a kind of running joke where Jeff has talked about on this podcast with the
4389200	4392480	9 11 thing. Every time he looks at the clock, it says 9 11. Not every time he looks at the clock,
4392480	4398160	he sees 9 11 run times as a guy who like yourself, I believe the phrase he used was I'm very like
4398160	4404480	science and all that. Uh, I also am very like science and all that. Although I am a, I am a,
4404480	4408880	the foremost proponent of having a relationship with the unknown and the idea that life is
4408880	4413760	mysterious and that there's a consciousness to the universe and, and, and blibbity blah. Uh,
4414800	4419280	but, but that's philosophy and kind of like, like, like when it comes to like Abe Lincoln might be in
4419280	4424880	your dining room and you know, like the, the, the numerology and, and, and the ability to sound very
4424880	4430640	sciency. I'm saying when it comes to that stuff, when it comes to that stuff, I'm skeptical by
4430640	4436560	default because it's dangerous to bother to believe something, uh, by default. Um, uh, we've
4436560	4443200	talked about that here anyways. So I like as a skeptic, like I like Jeff cause there's a clock
4443200	4449120	next to Jeff's head. So every time I do the show, I see Jeff's face and I see a big red numbers and
4449120	4453600	it says when every time it says 9 11, which is once during the show lately, because we had that
4453600	4457520	conversation, I could go, Jeff, look what time it is, which is both a call back. And it's also
4457520	4462640	kind of like, I don't know if I'm like proving it's wrong or whatever. We talked about that.
4462640	4466880	Didn't he, is it my imagination or did he get a little, you got a little, like you thought I was
4466880	4471680	like, like, like attacking you. No, no, no. What I thought, I, I thought I was, it was being revealed
4471680	4475760	that that was, that was a burr in your boot that I, that I, I had said that burr. I mean, yeah,
4475760	4480480	burr in my, like, like, like literally that, that extreme, like a burr in my boot, like, like
4480480	4485920	nothing. Like I, I own it. I don't care. It's not your fault. I don't care. I, I'm not, it doesn't
4485920	4490720	make me, I don't go like, Jeff's hurting my foot. It's a burr in my boot. And it's not, it really,
4490720	4497120	that burr is too strong. Is there a micro burr? Is there like, yeah, I've heard of micro burries.
4497120	4505680	Is that what that is? Yeah, yeah. It's like, so, so, so, so here's the thing. I just want to like,
4505680	4510320	my sense of justice, because I felt like, I felt like Jeff got mad at me for just a second. Like,
4510400	4515280	I can read his body language in his face. Because I was like, well, Jeff, you believe that you see
4515280	4519840	9-11 on the clock all the time. And wasn't he just for a second, he was kind of like,
4519840	4525280	what? No, I'm not, I'm not that into that one. And then proceeded to reveal that he is the plot
4525280	4534560	of a CW show. That every night he goes to sleep and werewolves come to him. The reason I get angry
4534560	4547440	is because I didn't choose this power. Let's play D&D, shall we? Spencer, if you would.
4549360	4552720	Last time on Harmontown D.
4555440	4562560	And D. Our heroes were in the midst of a decisive duel with deadly doppelgangers,
4562560	4568640	except not real doppelgangers. They were the gang's own shadows. There's a difference. After 30
4568640	4575280	solid episodes, 30? About that long. Of combat, the gang had been pushed to the brink of destruction.
4575280	4581040	Wounded and bleeding, Krista Berg was dying. Sharpie saved the singer, swiftly swinging the
4581040	4587120	soul of growth to soothe the savagely sundered sneak. Down, but not out. The foes regrouped,
4587120	4593840	attacks were made, weapons were used, some things happened, and then the shadows were dead. As they
4593840	4599120	stood above the broken corpse of their slain shadows, the dark sun pulsed, and they were back
4599120	4607520	in their home in the canny forest. The end. That's uh, yeah, the last episode, we just finished the
4607520	4613440	fight with the shadow people. And now we're back on the regular. Not much happened. Not back in our
4613440	4617360	own world though, that's the thing. Like I can't remember before we got sucked to the shadow plane,
4617360	4621920	where were we before we went to the shadow plane? We were in a fish. Let's take a trip. We were in a
4621920	4628480	fish, but the fish blew up and we crashed. Starting plane, the material plane. That's the home world.
4628480	4634800	Um, eaten by the infina fish who took you through time and space, and uh, you killed him while you
4634800	4638960	were in the plane of twilight. Doesn't everything kind of take you through time and space though?
4638960	4644560	In a way, like, yeah, existing would take you through time. The earth takes us through space.
4645280	4656560	Yeah. Fair play. I mean, not really the time to nitpick. I'm sorry. The guy's here to give us.
4656560	4662880	No, I know. We're all on the same page. Yeah. No, I want, you two are fighting. We're just all defining
4662880	4668320	reality. Uh, all right. So, so in the official, you're just saying he took us through the plane
4668320	4674080	of twilight? Yeah. The plane of Twyla, which was sometimes Twyla, but not always. That was,
4674080	4679360	that was the foresty place. You met, uh, Christoperg there. Uh, he, he took you to the soul of growth.
4680240	4685840	Man, you guys did that stuff. Well, no, I used it like crazy in the last episode. I'm not kidding.
4686800	4694080	Beef fungus bill came up and played for you. And, uh, there was a, I mean, thanks. Oh, yeah.
4694080	4696560	I thought you were saying thanks to me for letting him play. No, no, no. Thanks.
4699760	4704880	He reminded me like, do you have the soul of growth? I, I, it pretty much kept us at death's
4704880	4710960	door. Like I, when I use it, it's kind of like a heal, heal all like, like it gives us all a little,
4710960	4718320	little glass of lemonade. Great. Anyway, plane of Twyla took you to the plane of shadow.
4718960	4724720	Now you're back to the plane of material plane. Oh, we're just back back to where my dad was in
4724720	4730800	the burned ruins of the Connie forest. Weren't we going somewhere? We were trying to, what are we
4730800	4738320	doing? There's a good chance. What we were doing was asking what we were doing because we've done
4738320	4749280	that a lot too, but really overall, what are we trying to achieve? Adventure. No. All right.
4750080	4754800	Well, I'm going to put some, uh, some, some meat all over my body and just run around.
4756240	4760400	You can ask in your own day to day life. I mean, it's the, the answer is no more clear than it is.
4760400	4763200	I mean, what did we do today? Why did we go to puppy kindergarten? I mean,
4763200	4766080	is that our mission when we're done with that? Do we just blow our brains out?
4766080	4781920	It's a, it's a, it's a, one of you does. It's part of a, my nose starts bleeding like fire starter.
4785120	4788880	It is taking so much effort on my part to not just talk to Jeff.
4790320	4795520	Well, we can do between the two of us. One of us was to commit suicide. Who would it be? I mean,
4795520	4802240	that's a very dark topic, but definitely me. What are you talking about? I hope that answer
4802240	4810240	gives you the happiness you need to carry on. It doesn't help me any. It's, uh, bothersome.
4811680	4818320	I am sorry. Can I ask something and we'll go back to D and D real quick. So you guys, you knew about
4818320	4826240	this. Well, I'm always so drunk when I'm with him that the line between my friend being crazy
4826240	4832400	and my friend being psychic is like pointless. Like it's like, like, like juke boxes are become
4832400	4837440	important. You know, like I start crying about my dad because I hear, you know, a country western
4837440	4841360	song. These are things that when you wake up in the morning, you're like, what was that?
4841360	4846240	Reality's a little fluid. Did Jeff say he was psychic last night? Yeah, but I don't believe
4846240	4853040	in psychic. I don't think, I don't think psychic is the thing. What is it? Is it the P word to you?
4853040	4861760	You guys don't know. I prefer to call myself temporarily advanced. I don't, I mean, I don't,
4861760	4865840	I don't, I don't believe in ghosts necessarily either. I think there's something to people
4865840	4870080	having certain encounters and stuff like that. I don't think you, I don't think a spooky ghost
4870080	4877920	running around Stan Lee here podcast episode 38 where Jeff talks about ghosts for you. You had a
4877920	4881120	ghost. You have a ghost story. I have a fucking, I have a couple of doozies of ghosts. That apartment
4881120	4886080	was haunted. Yeah. Rob's Rob's current department is or was haunted when I lived there. I believe
4886080	4891840	in psychic ability. I think that we don't, we don't know what we're capable of. And I, I believe you.
4891840	4896240	I feel like I'm not saying I don't believe you. I just want to know more. I feel like, like there
4896320	4900480	were a lot of people. I, I, I've talked to other people that on nine 11 that, that morning,
4900480	4904320	because I mean, honestly, like the, was there a meeting of the, uh, temporarily advanced?
4906000	4911760	Like, oh, we fucked up again. It's just, everyone stands up and deals with their guilt of like,
4911760	4918480	yeah, I shouldn't have slipped in. I was eating toast. It was doing an improv show in Montreal.
4919200	4920720	They're on improv comedians.
4924160	4927520	I like the idea that there's a class system where there are the people who just know what's going
4927520	4933200	to happen like two hours before. I felt like it was a time in my life when I actually had like,
4933200	4938320	like visions and voices and stuff. Like, like nothing that meaningful. I don't,
4938320	4942640	I don't want to be mean, but this is like such a shitty use of your power is being here right now.
4943360	4946000	Is it? Yes. Okay.
4947360	4954080	Thank you. There was like a diversion path where like one prevents nine 11 and one you're
4954080	4957840	comfortable. I just felt there was, there was a time in my life when I was, when I was, especially
4957840	4960560	like when I was really broke and being evicted and I didn't know what was going to happen to me,
4960560	4964480	I felt very like in the moment at all times. There was no past, there was no future. It was like
4964480	4968080	every, from moment to moment, I didn't know what was going to happen. And I really felt there was
4968080	4971200	like, it was a couple of years in my life where I felt like I could point where the lightning was
4971200	4976000	about to strike. Like if there was a storm out there and I felt it was like, you know, like Ken
4976000	4980000	Kesey on Asli talked about that. It was like, you're so in the moment that past and future kind
4980000	4983760	of are all touching. It's all one thing. So like, like you're just kind of so in the moment that
4983760	4988000	everything it's all kind of happening together. Like someone coming to a show and being like,
4988000	4991360	I think I'm going to play Dungeons and Dragons with Dan Harmon. And then that night we go,
4991360	4995120	we're going to, who, is there anyone who's a dungeon master here? There's a little bit of magic
4995120	5000480	to sure. But that's a big leap from knowing nine 11 is going to happen. Jeff, have you ever
5000480	5007600	only to the 9 11 people for those 3000 people? These premonitions were stronger when you were
5007600	5012080	younger. Did you ever wonder if you cause them? Did you ever get nervous about that?
5012080	5016000	My mom who passed away when I was 13, she had a recording. She went to a psychic when she,
5016000	5020560	when she was pregnant with my brother and she wasn't like, like, like into mysticism and stuff,
5020560	5025040	but she went to like, had a psychic reading that was recorded. And everything that she said about
5025040	5029680	my brother, pretty accurate. And she said about me that I would be psychic. And then I've, I've,
5030000	5030960	I've been with friends.
5036000	5040560	Way to bury the lead, bro. Jeff, Jeff is going to start flying around the room and be like,
5040560	5046400	no, I'm not. I'm not psychic. My mom's crazy. She predicted I would be psychic. And now I am,
5046400	5051280	but she wasn't into mysticism. Like everyone does, she had a recording.
5052560	5056640	I was, I was at a coffee place with my friend, Michael Pollock, a piano player.
5056640	5059680	And I have your disciple.
5065920	5070320	We're getting coffee and there, he was going through a bad, like, like business thing with
5070320	5074480	like some stuff. And there was, and he's totally skeptical, like, like, like absolutely a cynic
5074480	5077280	and all kinds of things, I guess. And there was a woman doing tarot readings. Like,
5077280	5081760	I'm going to go get a tarot reading over there. So he sat down and he didn't act like, like,
5081760	5086080	come on, show me what's up. And so she sat down and she does the tarot stuff. I don't know how
5086160	5091760	it all works. And it seems like you might. So we're sitting there and she, the first two things
5091760	5095760	she said, she goes, this is, this is about business. There's a woman that you work with
5095760	5098880	this pit. No, sorry. It's a guy that you work with. That's fucking you out of something right
5098880	5101920	now. That's why you sat down right now. He's like, that's exactly why I sat down. So, okay,
5101920	5105760	now I'm on board. And she got another thing, like right out of, before he even said anything,
5105760	5108880	she said two things about it right on it. And she got the third thing she says was,
5109520	5113600	as I was sitting next to him, she goes, I'm sorry, can your friend leave? He's freaking me out right
5113600	5117360	now. I'm like, what? And she goes, you're really psychic and it's fucking throwing me off.
5128960	5136320	Are these stories so old for you? You know, like, have you talked about this with him before?
5136320	5144560	I feel like I have. Jeff, Jeff, Jeff can't pass the butter without being special. Like, like,
5145680	5157200	there is, there's his stories. He's so funny. You literally go, there's Jeff again.
5158000	5165040	I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying that in a punitive way. I'm like, I'm his,
5165040	5170240	I'm his best friend. I've been hanging out with him forever. If you're asking me if I'm bored,
5171360	5180800	hearing about how remarkable he is. I mean, I'm familiar with it. I know that he is. I know that
5180800	5187920	he has a lot of predicted, you know, she, she had, there's this old, like old tape, uh, like there's
5187920	5192960	a tape of this. Yeah. And the woman that gives her the reading tells her that, that I'm going
5192960	5199920	to be psychic. There's an actual tape of this. Yeah. I mean, we have a podcast, so I guess we
5199920	5205040	should, I wish there was some way we could share it. My sister would have it. If anybody has it,
5205040	5215840	I'll try to find it. Your sister that disappeared in Roswell. By the way, Jeff's 80.
5218480	5223360	All right. Uh, all right. Yeah. So where are the material? I mean, you heard it. Look, you, you,
5223360	5227520	you've been around to hear long enough to hear that he can't go out for drinks without meeting
5227520	5232240	Vince fucking Neil. It's everywhere he goes. He goes to Las Vegas and Neil Diamond goes like,
5232240	5236000	Hey, wait, sorry. I got to stop singing. Who's in the audience? Hey, you get over here. And he just
5236000	5240800	goes and hangs out with Neil Diamond. It's not lies. He's not lying. No, he's like, after a while,
5240800	5252160	it's like, Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's like a real life forest gump. I'm not. There should be footage of
5252160	5258960	him. Like, I don't want it to stop. I don't, but, but, but I'm not like, what the fuck? I bet six
5259040	5262560	years ago, there was one point where he was like, it's all about community. And then he walked away.
5265120	5270240	Well, he did. I mean, he is like, when I first moved to LA, Jeff, the reason Jeff and I are such
5270240	5274400	good friends is because he, we were, we were both fucking broke ass vagabonds. And all,
5274400	5277360	all we would do is go out for drinks and tell each other how talented we were.
5279360	5282640	You're such a good actor. And we're like, I know you're such a good writer. And we were like,
5283360	5288880	Jeff was like, I see good things for you. We, we, we, we believed it enough. I look,
5288880	5293840	I look back on how bad a writer I was when Jeff was telling me I was a good writer. And I realized
5293840	5301360	that I owe my entire life to being convinced by him. Like, I, it's kind of, I don't know if it's,
5302320	5307360	there's something sad about it, isn't it? That was an amazing time. It's either jumbo's feather or
5307360	5312320	it's like, uh, Dan, Dan used to pay my bills and then for that, when he, when he had money,
5312320	5315200	then he was broke and I paid his bills for a while. I mean, we kind of went back and forth
5315200	5319600	and we really like, we're keeping each other alive. I go like, uh, dude, can I, I don't know
5319600	5326320	how to say this because I'm proud. Can I borrow $2,000? I'm going to get evicted. Yeah, no,
5326320	5330880	here you go. Here you go. I'm so sorry. And then both, you know, back and forth, back and forth,
5330880	5336320	back and forth, like, like, like, like, and every time what one person would say to the other is,
5336320	5341120	look, it's not that big a favor. Like I have money right now. You don't, but I know you're
5341120	5345840	going to, because I know that you're a special, wonderful person. I mean, that's beautiful,
5345840	5352480	but now are you bummed out because you know that he knew he could have planned. Oh my God.
5352480	5360880	Oh my God. I just got that. He was cheating. I was an actual good person.
5361280	5366560	Yeah. And he just knew. Dan,
5367680	5371440	I had to wait until you're ready to, ready to learn that to find that out for yourself.
5373520	5378720	I fired five arrows. I mean, I guess what's the difference though between faith and, and
5378720	5383840	prognostication? I mean, what, what is that? When you, if you say to your friend, I know that you're
5383840	5388240	going to be president of the United States. Like, are you a Dick? If you're psychic and you actually
5388240	5392560	know more than you are, maybe cause them to become the president because you already
5392560	5396880	knew it was going to happen. And then you told him, I'm telling you, like, I was really hacky
5396880	5402320	when I was 26. I was not, I was like, like, like, like, you know, monster house had to be rewritten
5402320	5408560	by the lady that did Willy Wonka through whatever adventures. I, like, I, I sat there for two years,
5408560	5411840	tried to write a movie about a house that eats children on trick or treat and couldn't get
5411840	5416640	through it without having a fucking nervous breakdown. My head's so far up my ass. I never
5416640	5420720	would have gotten through anything, but I would go out for drinks with this guy that would go like,
5421440	5425840	you know, you're right. You're right. I bet we'll find a picture at some point of the civil war
5425840	5433120	and Jeff is there like talking to Lincoln. Hey, here's an idea. I don't want to be crazy, but
5434160	5437840	it's a picture of me in bed the day he gets shot. And I was late for the theater. I had a ticket.
5438640	5445200	You're trying to catch a bus to my American cousin on the nightstand and you're just
5445200	5450560	like fucking some flapper. I was going to say flapper, but my knowledge of history
5451520	5454000	and women only goes back. He just means a woman who talks a lot.
5456560	5461280	I was so appreciative that I predicted the fads of 60 years in the future of what women would be
5461280	5464880	doing and dressing. Yeah. All your hair is going to be short. You're going to be doing the Charleston.
5465760	5469600	Did you know he was going to have a haircut when he showed up today? Yes, because I saw him
5469600	5474400	yesterday. Okay. See, he's not psychic anymore because he has Instagram. He doesn't care. Okay.
5475360	5480240	And Jeff, you have kind of a weird relationship with this ability. You sometimes embrace it.
5482880	5486480	I was talking to our friend Sam Christensen about it because this is when it was all happening and
5486480	5491280	it happened quite a lot. And it actually kind of wore me out a little bit. And there was times when
5491280	5495040	I felt like I actually felt guilty when a tsunami happened and I didn't dream about it. I felt
5495040	5498800	guilty about it. But even if you hadn't dreamed about it, you would have done fucking nothing
5498800	5504560	about it because it would have been happening. I actually went to this place. I should have
5504560	5511760	tripped about that. I'm a bad person. I couldn't meet my weight blocker 3000. In a way, that's
5511760	5520880	the most narcissistic thing I've ever heard. I felt like I'm losing touch. Oh, okay. I've lost
5520880	5526480	that thing. But Sam Christensen is kind of why his sage friend of ours is great. He's like, you're in
5526480	5530480	a place right now where like a lot is happening for you. And you're kind of in a strange moment
5530480	5533600	because you don't want to be in this place forever. It's going to take a lot out of you.
5535040	5539520	When I was really, really broke, I really had like, I would hear voices and stuff.
5539520	5541840	I think it's weird to me. I imagine you being broke and being like,
5541840	5545520	I wish I could somehow make money. That glass is going to fall. The haircut is going to crash.
5545520	5551920	I wish there was some way. I guess I'll go on audition.
5551920	5557200	I'm going to drink on my brain and tell him he's going to be okay.
5557200	5562320	Time to reach my brain across time and see which blood donation clinic is paying the most tomorrow.
5565680	5568720	What is pilot season? That pilot is going to fly into a building.
5572960	5578800	Yeah. It stopped happening. But once in a while, I'll still have dreams where like
5578800	5583520	in the dream, I'll wonder like, you know, you can kind of navigate your dreams. You can kind of
5583520	5586960	pick like, I want to try to steer left into that part of the dream or, or go back.
5586960	5589280	I don't have that. I just have my dreams are on rails.
5590640	5594480	There were times when things would be happening. Oh, actually, I would say out loud, the helicopter
5594480	5598960	one, right. I woke up in the morning. I said out loud to myself before I went to bed as an
5598960	5603840	experiment. I said, have one of your dreams tonight. Like have one, have a dream about
5603840	5607520	something that happens tomorrow. I assume you were single at the time. I was.
5610160	5616400	Have one of your dreams tonight. What was that baby? What? What? I have to go.
5619840	5624720	I was very single. Do you have premonitions about anybody?
5625520	5628880	No, never people. Never people. But like, I mean, I dream, my dream life is really like,
5628880	5632480	I wouldn't trade my dream life for anything. But like, I woke up in the morning and I really went
5632560	5636160	to the computer and it was the first time I had money to have a computer and I went to the computer
5636160	5641680	and I typed in Mexican backyard helicopter crash. And there was a helicopter crash that killed three
5641680	5645440	in a backyard. They just like fell into some residential neighborhood. It was exactly what
5645440	5649840	I dreamt. And I was like, that doesn't help anybody. That's the stupidest power in the world.
5651040	5656400	It seems like if you'd worked on it, not, I mean, listen, it's probably too big.
5656400	5662240	I'm lazy. Yeah. It doesn't happen as much anymore. But there was a time and it was pretty
5662240	5666000	wild. But like, my favorite memories is like, of us, Dan, is like, when you were like writing
5666000	5670320	monster, you'd just be drawing them and you'd just be sobbing, crying because you couldn't
5670320	5675520	finish the script about the house that is a monster. And you were so broke one time. It's
5675520	5681120	like, Dan, like you were really broke, which is amazing. You'd make like $300,000. And then like,
5681120	5686000	like six months later, penniless, like you had, but you had a Pac-Man and a centipede in your house.
5686480	5689120	And your apartment. Yeah, it wasn't six months. It was a couple of years.
5689680	5692160	What happened to that Pac-Man and that centipede? They're at my studio.
5692880	5699280	What? What studio? I make cartoons. I was imagining a Pied d'etre.
5704080	5710720	They're in Puerto Vallarta at the summer home. Do you remember when I told you, I said like,
5710720	5714800	you wouldn't finish Daedalus, the script you're writing. And I said, write me the first like 40
5714800	5718880	pages of it and I'll pay your rent. And you're like, I'll take you up on that. Because that's
5718880	5724160	where you were. Because you wouldn't finish it. You wouldn't get it out. You wouldn't like
5724160	5729200	click print or, you know, like on anything, like feature stuff. And I was like, you're so broke.
5729200	5733200	It's like, I'll pay your rent for the next two months if you give me the script and I won't show
5733200	5736960	it to anybody. And you're like, I actually will take you up on that. And you still didn't do it.
5736960	5739440	You still didn't write? No, I gave you, I gave you pages. I didn't read it.
5740160	5743200	Okay. He knew there was shit.
5744320	5747040	I know. I can't, I can't give him a little envelope with the pages.
5749200	5752160	It was the best time. I still think you need to make that movie.
5752160	5764880	Well, I'm going to. You don't, you know, the, the, by the way, the movie that you're thinking of
5764880	5768640	writing, that you've been thinking of writing since you were 25, put it off till you're 40.
5768640	5774160	You will get so much more work done. Like don't try, like the thing that you were thinking of
5774160	5777360	when you were 15 and you're listening to the Pink Floyd or whatever the modern equivalent is,
5777360	5780400	and you're like, Oh, I can see the whole thing. I'm going to move on to LA and I'm going to be a
5780400	5784640	screenwriter because I got this idea. It's a fine idea, but fuck you. You can't write it.
5785200	5790880	By the way, this, this don't try philosophy exactly explains why Jeff never did anything
5792080	5795360	because he's friends with you and you were like, don't try. And he's like, you're right.
5796320	5801440	Well, no, but I'm saying to the young writers in the audience, I'm saying the ideas that you have,
5801440	5805920	the screenplays that you think that you're destined to write, maybe you are destined to write them,
5805920	5810320	but much like the relationships you're destined to have, you're, you might not be the writer that
5810320	5814640	is supposed to be writing that script at that time. Where do you think is the best place to
5814640	5820240	get our ideas? I don't, I don't, I think that ideas come from whatever gives Jeff his psychic
5820320	5825840	powers. I think that, I think that ideas, so this is where I become a non skeptic about
5826480	5831520	just about mythology and things. I think that we are vessels. I think that we are prisms,
5831520	5836800	you know, like, like to use that metaphor, light doesn't look like anything. It's in the air all
5836800	5842240	around us. Campbell said that religion, for instance, is a frame that you draw around
5842240	5846800	nothing. You draw the frame so that people can actually appreciate what nothing actually means
5847040	5852880	for a second, but too many religions, too many sects of religions, too many zealots of sects
5852880	5860400	of religions, they add so much stained glass, they add so much opacity to the window that it becomes
5860400	5866640	a newspaper. It becomes something that blocks light and casts shadows. Those shadows take the
5866640	5872640	form of explosions and wars and all kinds of things because it's too many people taking too
5872720	5878960	much shit way too seriously that was meant to be transparent, open source. The air around us is
5878960	5885040	filled with the thing that we are constantly struggling with. We as a great species were
5885040	5891200	designed, we were born with these antennae that we were able to actually suck the nothingness
5891200	5896560	through us and split it into all kinds of weird shit based on where our parents touched us when
5896960	5903200	and spray it onto a piece of paper or on a celluloid or a digital projector or
5904720	5911840	for you kids out there, some kind of podcast. The light comes through you, it gets scattered
5911840	5918000	unintentionally by who you are. Your job is to share that map of the cosmos with everyone around
5918000	5923600	you. For that reason, if you're thinking in your head, oh man, I got this great idea, it's like
5923600	5927040	Batman, but he's not Batman, it's set in the future, but he goes back to the 1920s and he's
5927040	5931520	fighting Chicago monsters and he just drives a Prius and he's got a thing. Fuck, you can't steal
5931520	5941840	this. That idea you had that you were working on on prom night that you used as the reason why
5941840	5949760	you weren't going, you will write it one day or pieces of it will slowly get chunked into
5949760	5954160	everything that you write, but the important thing to realize is that you don't create ideas.
5954720	5961280	There is something else out there that creates ideas. Your job is to suck them in and shit them
5961280	5968640	out. You're supposed to kind of be a dick about it, kind of be lazy and follow your bliss and go,
5968640	5971840	does somebody give me the light? Oh, the door's open. Okay. I was like, holy shit,
5972080	5981200	get the light at Harman town. That's when, okay, now I'm embarrassed. I'm just saying,
5981840	5988240	because if you're like me and many of you are, you walked around your living room and you played
5988240	5992960	certain music and you imagined yourself accepting an Oscar for some movie that had so many fucking
5992960	6000000	characters in it that it was impossible to watch. It's some kind of thing. In the meantime, you will,
6000560	6003440	you know, what do they say? What's the saying? Life is what happens.
6004480	6012480	It's a box of chocolate while you're waiting. Life is the thing that interrupts you while you're
6012480	6017040	making other plans. What is it? Life is what happens while you're making other plans. Yeah,
6017040	6020640	go ahead, chart your course by that star, but accept the fact that that's not what you're going
6020640	6025200	to be famous for. It's not what you, you don't control it. We can't all, we can't all be Jeff
6025200	6030880	Davis. We can't just go to bed and dream of Chechnya. By the way, that's the name of your one
6030880	6038320	man show. Dreams of Chechnya. For instance, you know, we, we, we planned, we brought Spencer out
6038320	6041760	here early for some reason and we're not going to, we're not using him at all. We're not going to
6041760	6046320	play D and D tonight, but yet we kind of, we've kind of fell down our own little dungeon. I feel
6046320	6053680	like we didn't really need to go to a magical place because we already were, I mean, what could be
6053680	6059040	more awesome and weirder. And I don't mean, I mean that in a great way than listening to
6060480	6065760	you having dreams about shit that hasn't happened yet. That doesn't happen to anybody else. No one
6065760	6070880	else has had that before. That happens to my mom. You're right there. What's your name?
6070880	6076080	Erin. You've had that happen to you before? Yeah. You want to come up? Briefly, what was it?
6076640	6082400	Um, I was just real small and I just, I was young and I had a, I had a really
6082400	6087680	sexy dream. A sexy dream? Yeah. You were little and you had a sexy dream and it came true. That's
6087680	6095600	not good. I didn't like my dad and I had a dream about my first boyfriend, which was years later,
6095600	6100960	so. What did your first boyfriend say when you explained that to him? I never told him.
6100960	6105360	You never told him? Wait, you had a dream that you were going to have a boyfriend at one point
6105440	6109440	and then years later you had a boyfriend? No, I'm not. I'm just want to be clear what the
6110320	6113760	power is. You knew it was going to be, you knew it was going to be the specific guy. You knew it
6113760	6118080	would be this. I didn't know that I didn't, I didn't have a face or anything, but when I met him,
6118080	6121120	I just knew it. Oh, well that's, I think I was just talking about. Are you guys still together?
6121120	6124960	No. Why did you break up? Um, I- She told him that story.
6126800	6131520	I used to live in Illinois and then I moved to Ohio. So instead of having a long history
6131520	6136160	relationship, we just decided to break it. All right. So kind of different. I was a very
6136160	6140720	different. Sometimes love reaches across time, space, and reality and, and, but you know,
6140720	6144640	Illinois to Ohio, geez. How are you going to make that work? This guy's dreaming of
6144640	6151520	Mexican helicopters. So surprise you not, you didn't tell him, even when you were breaking up,
6152080	6157040	if it was me, I would scream it at him as I was grabbing the, you never thought. Well,
6157040	6160960	clearly she got sick of him. She was like, I can't tell him about the dream now.
6160960	6164960	I hate the way he slurps his cereal. I don't want him to think this is cosmic.
6164960	6168000	We're actually still in touch, but we don't talk as much as we used to.
6168000	6169120	That's good. Move on.
6172080	6175520	Spencer, it looks like we're not going to get to play any D&D tonight, man.
6175520	6179040	Can I tell you guys, I had a dream last night. Whoa. Yeah.
6179040	6184720	About that we wouldn't be able to play. It was about, uh, like Jeff and he was talking.
6184720	6190080	And so, so I didn't prepare any D&D content and it ended up working out.
6191520	6195120	Yeah. Wow. Full circle. Full circle.
6196080	6198320	Thank you very much, everybody. Welcome. Thank you.
