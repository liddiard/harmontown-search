0	8000	Beautiful uptown Burbank, in the heat of the night with the whole world on fire around us.
8000	15000	As ash rains slowly down on all of our cars and into our hair, Harmon Town is in session.
21000	25000	Let's bring out our beloved game master, Spencer Credenden.
31000	34000	And the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
39000	42000	Thank you. Thank you.
44000	45000	Thank you.
47000	48000	What's up, Dan?
48000	51000	Yeah, it's just not a bad mood. It's going to be a bad show.
53000	58000	Aside from it being hot in the world becoming a horrible hellfire of crap,
59000	60000	what's your problem?
60000	61000	I don't know.
62000	67000	I was in a good mood like all week because it was kind of a, I guess it was a thing because it was like, you know,
67000	71000	there's a hurricane in Texas and there's a, I don't know if it gets heard about that.
71000	73000	Have you guys heard of a hurricane in Texas?
75000	77000	And Bangladesh too, like, wait, right?
81000	86000	You know, and so then you go like, okay, well I have my health, I have my property, there's no alligators in my living room.
87000	92000	And you put you in a kind of a good mood, like I was in a good mood, but I think that it's like an artificial good mood
92000	94000	because it's derived from other people's misery.
94000	99000	It's like that whole thing where you're like, well, I have my health and I'm going to live it each day like it's my last.
99000	102000	Like, I think that's like taking ecstasy. It like crashes.
102000	104000	Because now I'm just miserable.
104000	107000	And I'm like, it was all triggered by me.
108000	113000	It was all triggered by me losing my second pair of those fucking air pods.
114000	121000	I lost the first pair, like, and then I made Spencer go find me another pair.
121000	123000	I think those things are like 200 bucks.
124000	127000	I got a pair I haven't used. They're still in the packaging. You want those?
127000	129000	Oh, this is perfect.
129000	130000	Yeah.
132000	134000	Why do you, you don't want them or something?
134000	139000	Normally I can see Spencer, but tonight there's a different layout where I can't see Spencer through you.
139000	141000	I assume they know what they're doing, huh?
141000	142000	Yeah.
142000	143000	Oh, they know.
143000	147000	Spencer, are you farther upstage than normal? Aren't you more downstage normally?
147000	149000	I'm hiding behind Dan.
149000	150000	All right.
150000	151000	I'm feeling ugly.
151000	153000	You've been doing that your whole career, Spencer.
153000	154000	Yeah.
155000	157000	Oh, damn.
159000	162000	You've been your mom.
164000	165000	I've been my mom?
165000	166000	Yeah.
166000	168000	Oh, that explains so much.
169000	174000	Can I start off the show with a little interesting thing that I think is interesting?
174000	175000	Maybe nobody else does?
175000	176000	Sure.
176000	184000	A guy that I kind of know is an actor who hangs out at the world famous drawing room, bar and grill, except for the grill part.
186000	190000	He, we were talking and he goes, hey, you like old movies.
190000	191000	I go, yeah.
191000	197000	And he goes, I'm friends with some old movies people that we go on a walk every Saturday in Beverly Hills.
197000	198000	They're a little older.
198000	200000	They're like in their 80s.
200000	201000	And he goes, we go on a walk.
201000	202000	Do you want to go have a walk?
202000	206000	I walked in the park and spoke one on one with Anne Margaret today.
206000	207000	What?
207000	208000	Yeah.
208000	211000	I was just watching her in Anthony Hopkins magic.
211000	212000	Is that right?
212000	213000	Yeah.
213000	218000	I just saw her last, we just watched Cody and I just watched magic last night with Anthony Hopkins and Anne Margaret.
218000	223000	I started the day walking around with her and she's adorable and she had, it was so cute because her glasses,
223000	228000	she had these cool little framed glasses, but they were on really crooked and it made it so good.
228000	236000	And we were just walking and there's this group of people that are like old dancers and show people and comedians.
238000	243000	And two people that weren't there, that were supposed to be there, but they're going to come another time, are.
243000	244000	Letty and Squiggy.
245000	257000	Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall, who are a husband and wife comedy team, that were the act before the Beatles came out on the first Ed Sullivan show.
257000	260000	And so this weird old world, but they didn't come today.
260000	262000	I'm going to meet them because I can't wait.
262000	267000	But I just at one point am walking through a park in Beverly Hills, homely park.
267000	271000	And it's just, and I'm like, so, and like, are you from here?
271000	272000	Where are you from?
272000	273000	I was born in Sweden.
273000	274000	Do you still speak Swedish?
274000	276000	And she just started talking in Swedish to me.
276000	278000	I'm like, and Margaret's talking Swedish.
278000	279000	It was the best.
279000	282000	We just sat down and she's the sweetest, nicest person.
282000	283000	And we started talking.
283000	286000	She's like, what's funny on TV right now?
286000	290000	So I started saying, well, my favorite thing is toast of London.
290000	293000	And someone else in the group goes, oh, I love the IT crowd.
293000	295000	I go, I just met Graham Linahan.
295000	302000	And then we all just sat there and watched, like on phones, we just watched clips of Matt Berry doing toast of London.
302000	304000	And we're all dying laughing.
304000	308000	Well, Burbank raged a fire around you.
308000	309000	Yeah.
309000	310000	I mean, it's crazy.
310000	314000	Like, Texas is underwater and people, by the way, where were you guys last week?
314000	318000	Like, do you love boxing that much?
318000	322000	You drove toward a forest fire to get here tonight.
322000	326000	They probably, back last week, there were eight people here.
326000	327000	It was like, what?
327000	331000	I didn't know you guys were such MMA fans.
331000	332000	What's up?
332000	333000	We want more shoe jokes.
333000	334000	You want more shoe jokes.
334000	337000	Oh, is it the previous week?
337000	342000	Because it was like, oh, Dan overestimated the number of Nazis.
342000	345000	So then you guys didn't show up.
345000	349000	And then we unpacked the Schwab box again.
349000	351000	And now you're all back.
351000	352000	Guess what?
352000	354000	I asked him to come back and he said, fuck you.
354000	355000	Wait, what?
355000	356000	I am your friend.
356000	358000	You know who else doesn't want to come back?
358000	359000	Kumail.
359000	362000	Why don't you suck his dick some more in the Reddit?
362000	365000	Yeah, these people don't like you.
365000	367000	I do, kind of.
367000	371000	A little bit if you like me.
371000	374000	Counts for nothing.
374000	375000	Solicited.
375000	378000	Dan, I said I would give you my AirPods.
378000	379000	Okay.
379000	381000	I mean, it's just like, obviously it wasn't a thing.
381000	384000	Cody's got to be on the verge of breaking up with me.
384000	386000	Because I was just like, oh, I was in a pleasant mood.
386000	389000	I was learning about mind mapping software on my iPad.
389000	392000	And I was like, I'm going to listen to some tutorials.
392000	393000	I don't want to wake up Cody.
393000	396000	And I was like, oh, I lost the fucking AirPods again.
396000	399000	Literally had them for one day because I lost the last pair.
399000	401000	Every time you buy a pair of these things,
401000	403000	you just feel like the dumbest shitface in the world
403000	406000	because they suck their awful dumb things.
406000	408000	But then I lost the first pair.
408000	409000	And I was like, I miss them.
409000	411000	I don't want to tangle the cords anymore.
411000	412000	I was like, ah.
412000	415000	It was like after the first time, you fly first class
415000	416000	and then you try to, like, coach.
416000	418000	And you're like, my knees hurt.
418000	421000	And I just, like, my fingernails are dirty again.
421000	424000	And I just, like, I don't understand why they went to the dentist
424000	426000	and my teeth are, you know, decaying.
426000	428000	It's no big surprise there.
428000	430000	Like, not that bad, actually.
430000	432000	My family has very strong enamel.
432000	436000	But, you know, they're calling out the distance in millimeters
436000	437000	between each tooth.
437000	438000	And I got a couple fives.
438000	440000	And there, which means there's some, you know.
440000	441000	Oh, five?
441000	442000	Five?
442000	443000	That's gum trouble, baby.
443000	444000	Four or five.
444000	445000	That's a couple of them.
445000	446000	Five is way the fucker.
446000	448000	I got to get the deep laser cleaning.
448000	450000	You know, and she pointed the thing.
450000	454000	She said, like, look, there's been some damage here
454000	455000	to some bone material.
455000	457000	I'm like, oh, I'm 44.
457000	460000	But I'm just like, my fingernails are going to be there
460000	461000	the day they bury me.
461000	464000	Why do your teeth fall out and rot?
464000	466000	But your fucking dumbass fingernails, what are we,
466000	467000	you're going to fight lions?
467000	469000	What is the purpose of these?
469000	471000	What is the point of these?
471000	473000	They just, they get gross.
473000	475000	You know, I was at Comic-Con one year.
475000	477000	And I was, like, sad walking around.
477000	479000	And some young lady was like, Dan Harmon, I'm a big fan.
479000	482000	And I took a, she wanted to take a picture with me.
482000	484000	And I took a picture, like, got behind her
484000	486000	and kind of, like, had my hands on her shoulders.
486000	490000	And then I, like, saw her Instagram, like, you know,
490000	491000	a week later.
491000	494000	And it was, like, me posing with her.
494000	496000	And she was like, I met Dan Harmon at Comic-Con,
496000	498000	hashtag dirty fingernails.
498000	500000	Oh!
500000	501000	And she was right.
502000	503000	That's gross.
503000	504000	It's gross.
504000	506000	You know, it makes me flashback to math class,
506000	510000	my third grade math class with Mrs. Jackson.
510000	512000	I've probably talked about her before.
512000	513000	If you're nasty.
513000	517000	She called me up and gave me a brush and said,
517000	519000	Daniel, go wash your fingernails.
519000	520000	No!
520000	521000	In the whole class.
521000	524000	Were you changing somebody's oil?
524000	525000	No, I'm Dan Harmon.
525000	527000	I changed the world's oil.
528000	531000	I don't change my own oil, you know?
531000	533000	I don't bathe.
533000	535000	I don't clean myself enough.
535000	537000	I'm so sorry.
537000	538000	You know?
538000	539000	Take me to Golgotha.
539000	541000	Oh, the dirty kid.
541000	542000	I'll show you all.
542000	544000	But then I didn't show anybody.
544000	546000	I just keep losing my AirPods.
546000	549000	There is no recourse to happiness.
549000	554000	I spent 44 years, like, trying to secure, like,
554000	556000	a place of power and comfort.
556000	558000	And then fucking Nazis.
558000	560000	This is like a joke, you know?
560000	562000	Have you looked for your AirPods in your whiskers?
562000	565000	They might have just Captain Caveman'd inside there.
565000	567000	You might have, like, a rake in there
567000	570000	or something like lost keys.
570000	572000	My stomach hurts.
572000	574000	I ate at that shithole over in...
574000	576000	I guess I shouldn't mention it.
576000	577000	Yeah, don't...
577000	579000	That unnamed shithole.
579000	580000	I know, but I...
580000	581000	Because I know the good ones.
581000	582000	What is the name of it?
582000	584000	The people are fans of Rick and Morty.
584000	585000	Well, no, they're...
585000	587000	I mean, everyone's a fan of Rick and Morty,
587000	590000	so that could mean a lot of places and nothing specific.
590000	592000	Yeah, no, I just...
592000	594000	What kind of cuisine was it?
594000	596000	Don't say that.
596000	599000	Wait, it's so specific that we would know what it was.
599000	603000	It was a country that speaks a language that we do.
603000	604000	American?
604000	606000	Well, yes.
606000	608000	In a matter of speaking.
608000	610000	Is it a Burbank establishment?
610000	612000	Yeah, it's that British place on Burbank.
613000	615000	Oh, yeah, I tried.
615000	617000	It's so gross.
617000	619000	There's always like...
619000	622000	There's always like four old dudes.
622000	624000	Burbank is so fucked up, man.
624000	626000	You gotta drink it.
626000	630000	The day that Obama was like giving his farewell speech,
630000	631000	I was at a bar in Burbank,
631000	633000	and these fucking old dudes were like muttering
633000	635000	like the N-word into their cocktails.
635000	636000	Like, this place is...
636000	638000	Burbank's fucked up, man.
638000	641000	And now it burst into flames.
641000	643000	It just fucking couldn't take it.
643000	645000	It was like, I can't...
645000	647000	I was driving to Burbank straight into fire,
647000	650000	and I was like, same page club.
650000	652000	I get you, Burbank.
652000	655000	It's like Burbank's reflecting reality right now.
655000	658000	Everyone else is just living a lie.
658000	660000	I want to just...
660000	662000	I want to get my friend, the guy whose name is Pizza,
662000	664000	I'm going to get this desert property,
664000	666000	and I'm like, I just need to figure out
666000	668000	how to desalinate water, right?
668000	670000	Like, I need to...
670000	674000	And then also I need to bring an ocean to the desert.
674000	675000	I just want...
675000	676000	Don't you think there's a way to like...
676000	677000	I guess the reason...
677000	678000	Oh, yeah.
678000	679000	Just go out...
679000	681000	Like, you don't want to build a fence
681000	683000	because then if everyone's scavengers see a fence,
683000	684000	then they'll go like,
684000	686000	oh, there must be something on the other side of the fence.
686000	687000	So I'm just like,
687000	689000	buy a random spot in the desert,
689000	692000	and just keep it looking like regular random desert,
692000	696000	and then there's a spot where you point a clicker
696000	697000	and it goes...
697000	699000	And there's like solar panels
699000	701000	that no one can see from a distance.
701000	703000	They're just like sea level solar panels,
703000	707000	and you only expose them to charge your big battery
707000	708000	under the ground,
708000	710000	and then you go down there,
710000	713000	and there's like hydroponic soy, maybe.
713000	714000	Yeah.
714000	715000	A couple record albums.
715000	716000	Yeah, and you could...
716000	717000	A couple record albums.
717000	718000	Yeah, I don't know.
718000	722000	What are your desert, not island record albums?
722000	725000	You know, Genesis, Invisible Touch.
725000	726000	Whoo!
726000	727000	Yeah.
728000	729000	Whoo!
729000	733000	What are your deserted aisle hydroponic crops?
733000	734000	Soy.
734000	735000	Soy.
735000	736000	Oh.
736000	737000	Fair.
737000	738000	I don't know.
738000	739000	I don't know.
739000	740000	Dan, you get to...
740000	743000	In your desert commune,
743000	745000	you get two records.
745000	746000	You chose those.
746000	749000	Well, Genesis, Invisible Touch is one album.
749000	750000	That's one.
750000	751000	You get another one.
751000	752000	You can choose that later.
752000	755000	You get to choose one living person that you've never met
755000	757000	and one dead person that you've never met.
757000	758000	Spencer.
758000	759000	Yay.
762000	763000	You've never met Spencer?
763000	764000	Yay.
764000	765000	Oh, you said...
765000	766000	Somebody you've never met that's alive.
766000	767000	Okay.
767000	769000	And then somebody you've never met that's dead
769000	771000	to be part of your desert hangout.
771000	773000	Don the Dragon Wilson.
773000	776000	He's a kickboxing champion.
776000	778000	Just for security.
778000	779000	Yeah.
781000	783000	Although he's probably old now.
784000	785000	So, okay.
785000	786000	Forget that.
786000	788000	Seamus, the WWE wrestler.
788000	789000	Is that...
789000	790000	Seamus?
790000	792000	Colin McGregor.
793000	794000	Is that his real name?
794000	795000	Oh, no.
795000	796000	That's all right.
796000	797000	Seamus is his wrestling name.
797000	798000	Oh, okay.
798000	799000	And he likes Rick and Morty,
799000	802000	so he's got a big red beard.
802000	804000	And I figured he could probably...
804000	805000	Yeah.
805000	806000	Annie's mad you didn't pick her.
806000	807000	She's walking out.
807000	808000	I've met her.
808000	809000	Oh.
809000	810000	Okay.
811000	812000	All right.
813000	814000	Okay.
819000	820000	There was a guy...
820000	821000	How did she always get that seat?
821000	823000	Did she get her that early?
823000	824000	He knows it.
824000	825000	You know Annie.
825000	826000	I don't know.
826000	829000	She's always fucking conning people.
833000	834000	Wait, did she say that?
834000	836000	That was her, I think.
836000	840000	That's not a joke other people can get.
843000	844000	All right.
844000	845000	So, yeah.
845000	846000	Well, there was a guy FaceTiming.
846000	847000	What is with the...
847000	849000	I don't think anyone in this audience has ever done this,
849000	853000	but what is with the people who FaceTime in public?
853000	854000	Just like and crank it up.
854000	857000	And there was just a guy sitting at the bar
857000	859000	and there was just this woman.
859000	860000	It seemed like...
860000	862000	I made some assumptions.
862000	864000	It seemed like she was like a mail-order bride or something.
864000	866000	Like she had a really thick accent
866000	868000	and he was just like staring at her.
868000	870000	And she was just going like,
870000	871000	Okay, I love you.
871000	872000	I love you.
872000	874000	But he wasn't saying anything.
874000	877000	He was just like staring at her.
877000	878000	It was weird.
878000	880000	It was like I don't know if she was checking in on him
880000	881000	or him on her,
881000	883000	but it was like one of them thought the other one
883000	885000	was like an animal that you just monitor.
885000	888000	It was just like, uh-huh.
888000	890000	Okay, I love you.
890000	892000	Don't drink too much.
892000	893000	Like what do you do?
893000	895000	Why do you share?
895000	897000	How boring does your life have to be
897000	900000	if you're willing to have a phone call in public
900000	904000	and let everyone see the person you're talking to?
904000	907000	I was sitting at the bar at the Delta terminal
907000	910000	flying out of LAX and I was like an idiot.
910000	911000	I bring a book to a bar
911000	913000	and I get mad when people are loud
913000	917000	and aren't respecting my library time.
917000	919000	It's not rational.
919000	920000	But there was a girl next to me
920000	924000	who was FaceTiming with his sister at top volume.
924000	926000	And the sister was coming in through top volume.
926000	928000	Just the happiest sisters in the world.
928000	930000	Oh, no, you did not just talk about that.
930000	931000	Oh, yes, I did.
931000	932000	I'm fucking talking about that.
932000	935000	And I was like, we're both bad people.
935000	937000	I'm the guy that wants everyone to shut the fuck up.
937000	938000	You're the person that wants everyone
938000	941000	to never have a book ever.
941000	943000	I feel like everyone else in the world is always just like,
943000	945000	uh-huh, yeah, ah, ah, all over their phone.
945000	948000	And then every once in a while, I'll pick up
948000	951000	and as I'm leaving the restaurant,
951000	954000	it's a crying baby because I'm so concerned
954000	955000	with what other people think.
955000	957000	I'll still get some dirty look.
957000	959000	And someone will be like, could you take that outside?
959000	960000	Where do you think I'm going?
960000	962000	Why does this only happen to me?
962000	964000	Why can't I take those people and put them in the same room
964000	966000	as these people that I have to put up with?
966000	970000	Why does God hate me?
970000	974000	I feel like the only person that's having a good life
974000	975000	is Donald Trump.
975000	978000	And we're almost a year into living
978000	981000	in this shadow of this insane person.
981000	983000	It's almost been a fucking year.
983000	987000	That means that you could spend a year just not doing anything.
987000	990000	You could just spend a year going, I'm going to learn French
990000	992000	or I'm going to make a birdhouse.
992000	994000	There's no bad way to spend a year.
994000	998000	We just spent it fucking raising an autistic president.
1002000	1007000	I'm so sorry to my autistic fan base.
1007000	1011000	I don't mean he doesn't have the honor of being called autistic.
1011000	1012000	I don't mean he has autistic traits.
1012000	1015000	I just mean he's having an autistic kid,
1015000	1017000	like a three-year-old.
1017000	1018000	Why is that?
1018000	1019000	Fuck you people.
1019000	1022000	Why don't you eat my fucking shit out of my ass?
1022000	1023000	What are you doing?
1023000	1024000	Because you...
1024000	1025000	The fuck I...
1025000	1026000	Whoa!
1026000	1028000	You just woke up to controversy.
1028000	1030000	I already said autistic and apologized for it
1030000	1032000	and moved on!
1032000	1036000	Not the accurate physiological part of the autism,
1036000	1039000	just the annoying offensive part of the autistic.
1039000	1041000	That's the kind of autistic he is.
1041000	1043000	I think that's what I'm talking about.
1043000	1046000	I'm saying like if you talk to parents that have autistic children
1046000	1049000	they may love them or hate them, but it's hard to raise them.
1049000	1051000	They acknowledge that.
1051000	1052000	It's a challenge.
1052000	1055000	They're not like, this is a snap.
1055000	1056000	None of them.
1056000	1059000	I think your mustache and whiskers are doing most of the driving right now.
1059000	1061000	I think it's changed.
1061000	1064000	I think it's liberated a part of you
1064000	1067000	that maybe shouldn't have been liberated or maybe should have been.
1067000	1071000	I mean, are we really policing each other for offensiveness anymore?
1071000	1073000	There's a rapist in the White House!
1073000	1076000	He's a Nazi!
1076000	1078000	Go talk to him!
1078000	1079000	I mean...
1079000	1081000	I'm a saint!
1081000	1084000	Stop yelling at each other about hurting your feelings
1084000	1087000	just because there's a fucking dude that doesn't give a fuck
1087000	1090000	sitting on the throne of King's Landing
1090000	1094000	eating babies that you can't talk to,
1094000	1096000	that you can't wag your finger at, that has no shame.
1096000	1099000	Stop taking it out on each other.
1099000	1102000	It's fucking insane how fucking heightenedly...
1102000	1105000	I thought the one good thing would be,
1105000	1107000	oh, we elected a rapist Nazi.
1107000	1111000	Looks like political correctness is going to shift into neutral.
1111000	1113000	No! No, not at all!
1113000	1115000	No, quite the opposite.
1115000	1120000	Let's all start infighting about pronouns and fucking gender fluidity.
1120000	1125000	More than ever, microaggressions just became nanoaggressions.
1125000	1129000	Hi, Jane, how are you?
1129000	1131000	Thank you for coming.
1131000	1134000	My friend, Jane.
1134000	1138000	Always a micro-pleasure.
1138000	1143000	Let's make sure that we recognize that you just compared
1143000	1146000	children with autism to Nazi rapists.
1146000	1148000	You equated them a little bit.
1148000	1151000	Yeah, well, I mean, maybe by some, like,
1151000	1156000	transitive property of math that I don't even understand.
1156000	1160000	Like, I got a 30% of my ACTs.
1160000	1165000	Those are the Midwestern equivalent of the SATs.
1165000	1169000	Math, I'm like dumber than normal people in math.
1169000	1176000	Isn't that crazy, given how smart I am about, you know, in other areas?
1176000	1178000	I just get such a big kick out of that.
1178000	1182000	I'm so stupid sometimes in some ways.
1182000	1187000	Isn't that crazy?
1187000	1191000	Anyways, so can we talk about, wait, let me, I want to make sure.
1191000	1193000	Okay, yeah, well, what's with the new, okay.
1193000	1197000	So, like, you guys ever, like, you take a ride share service, like,
1197000	1203000	I guess I'm going to expose myself as, like, yeah, I've lapsed back into Ubers.
1203000	1207000	Why'd that happen? Did you try Lyft and not like it?
1207000	1210000	Yeah, I like to charge my phone.
1210000	1213000	Lyft, you can charge your phone.
1213000	1215000	No.
1215000	1218000	How many lifts did you take to prove that?
1218000	1222000	I don't like four or five. There had to be some reason. I don't know.
1222000	1224000	I think a lot of Lyft drivers have little phone chargers in there.
1224000	1227000	There was a guy who made me take my foot off his seat, like,
1227000	1230000	which I thought was so weird because it was a Lyft and not an Uber.
1230000	1232000	It was like a fucking Acura or something.
1232000	1234000	And he was like, could you lower your foot from my seat?
1235000	1238000	Your foot was like you were crossing your leg and it was touching the back?
1238000	1241000	I like to sit on my foot, you know, like, kind of sometimes.
1241000	1243000	Isn't that really uncomfortable?
1243000	1247000	No. I mean, I think it's just, I think I'm compensating maybe for, like,
1247000	1250000	40 years of a wallet. I don't know.
1250000	1253000	I don't know why it is. So, I like to tuck my little footsie underneath
1253000	1255000	one of my butt cheeks sometimes.
1255000	1258000	And you say get your street pavement foot off of my Acura.
1258000	1261000	Anyways, I'm sorry. Sorry, I take Ubers sometimes.
1261000	1265000	But there's this thing where they'll drop you off
1265000	1268000	and then they'll give you a business card and they'll try to, like,
1268000	1271000	indoctrinate you into their own, like, private business.
1271000	1273000	Like, they're like, oh, take my card.
1273000	1278000	So, like, if you want to get a ride from me, again,
1278000	1283000	don't use the service that arranges everything.
1283000	1286000	Like, take my business card and, like, call me on a regular phone.
1286000	1290000	And, like, what do they, how is that going to take off?
1290000	1291000	I've never experienced that.
1291000	1293000	It seems like everyone's doing that now.
1293000	1296000	They drop you off and then they go, by the way, here, take my card.
1296000	1298000	When you, if you want to get picked up, like, take my card.
1298000	1302000	Like, why would I, there's an app that, and so, and I was like,
1302000	1304000	well, I'm going to make this guy's day.
1304000	1309000	He dropped me off at the shitty British restaurant here in Burbank.
1309000	1312000	And he was like, hey, remember me?
1312000	1313000	I was that guy that gave you that card.
1313000	1315000	I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, do you have another card?
1315000	1318000	Because this time, actually, this might work because I'm going to eat here
1318000	1321000	and then I'm going to just be driving a couple of blocks over to the
1321000	1328000	Starburns Castle and he's like, oh, that, no, that makes no sense for me.
1328000	1330000	Okay, so it's based on logic?
1330000	1334000	Then don't give me a business card when I've met you through a hologram.
1334000	1336000	Don't ever give anybody a business card.
1336000	1338000	I've never, ever used one.
1338000	1342000	It's basically just things to go in my trash can.
1342000	1343000	Yeah.
1343000	1344000	I don't call them.
1344000	1345000	I've never needed one.
1345000	1346000	I've never wanted one.
1346000	1349000	It's a culture based on them in Japan, you know?
1349000	1350000	Is that right?
1350000	1352000	Maybe not still.
1352000	1354000	The whole culture is based on business cards?
1354000	1357000	Well, no, I'm just saying, like, they have a whole, like, you know,
1357000	1360000	that was, like, 90s Japan, at least.
1360000	1363000	When I was learning Japanese in Marquette University,
1363000	1365000	they were explaining the whole business card.
1365000	1367000	You studied Japanese in Marquette?
1367000	1369000	For, like, a semester.
1369000	1379000	Can anybody verify or do...
1379000	1381000	Oh, yeah?
1381000	1386000	Well, there's a lot of white Japanese people here.
1386000	1391000	I think we get a lot of anime fans in our...
1391000	1393000	What did you say, just for my own curiosity?
1393000	1395000	I speak a little Japanese, which is not true.
1395000	1399000	I can only say that.
1399000	1401000	That's technically true.
1401000	1405000	Biru o nomimashoka?
1405000	1409000	Should we drink beer?
1409000	1410000	Remember that one, too?
1410000	1412000	How do you say yes?
1412000	1414000	Hi.
1419000	1420000	I never...
1420000	1421000	I thought I knew everything about you.
1421000	1423000	I didn't know that you studied Japanese.
1424000	1426000	What was the end game on that one?
1426000	1427000	I just...
1427000	1430000	I dropped out of my freshman year of college
1430000	1431000	because I was just, like...
1431000	1433000	I was just cutting classes, and I just...
1433000	1435000	Yeah, just sad.
1435000	1437000	I remember, like, there was some exam, and I, like...
1437000	1438000	I was, like, a baby.
1438000	1441000	Like, I, like, pretended my mom was sick or something.
1441000	1442000	I was, like, you're an adult.
1442000	1444000	Just fucking leave college.
1444000	1447000	What are you trying to, like, make excuses?
1447000	1449000	No, but you chose Japanese because you wanted to learn Japanese,
1449000	1450000	or you were going to, like...
1450000	1451000	Yeah.
1451000	1452000	You became a translator, or...?
1452000	1454000	I think, at the time, I thought maybe I should learn
1454000	1456000	how to sell my dad's company.
1456000	1457000	Like...
1457000	1460000	At the time, the Japanese were, like, the Chinese of the time,
1460000	1461000	you know?
1461000	1463000	They were, like, the big financial thing.
1463000	1465000	All the Time magazine covers were, like...
1465000	1469000	You know, had, like, a gay show woman with a microchip
1469000	1471000	and a suitcase, you know, on the cover.
1471000	1473000	Like, the new threat?
1477000	1480000	Land of the Rising Nasdaq.
1483000	1485000	I like Grumpy Dan.
1485000	1487000	I like you when you're a little surly.
1487000	1489000	I hate society.
1489000	1492000	I hate every single human being.
1492000	1494000	Like, how cool do you think you are right now?
1494000	1496000	I fucking hate you.
1496000	1498000	And I'm sick of hearing...
1498000	1501000	I'm sick of, like, the press, like, vilifying Antifa.
1501000	1503000	Like, I don't have to suck their dicks or anything,
1503000	1505000	but it's, like, there's a couple of kids out there
1505000	1508000	that are, like, willing to be bullies back towards Nazis.
1508000	1510000	If we didn't have them, we wouldn't have anybody
1510000	1512000	that was scaring Nazis.
1512000	1515000	Give them some slack. They're anarchists, you know?
1515000	1517000	You know, when I was younger,
1517000	1519000	I had these foreign exchange students,
1519000	1521000	and one of them was...
1521000	1523000	His dad was, like, from Basque Country,
1523000	1526000	and he was apparently, like, a freedom fighter
1526000	1528000	against, like, Spain or some shit.
1528000	1530000	And the other guy was a Russian,
1530000	1532000	and he was part of an anti-Nazi gang
1532000	1535000	that would beat the shit out of neo-Nazis.
1535000	1538000	And it was when I was a young boy,
1538000	1542000	and I remember I told this to everyone I came across,
1542000	1545000	and everyone thought it was really badass.
1545000	1547000	What changed?
1547000	1549000	It's just cowardice, man.
1549000	1551000	It's like, okay, I'm sorry there's an extreme form
1551000	1553000	of being afraid of Nazis.
1553000	1554000	Like, it doesn't mean...
1554000	1556000	It's like, this advocacy for just complacency
1556000	1558000	just fucking pisses me off.
1558000	1560000	It's like, you're not gonna accomplish...
1560000	1561000	I'm just so sick of it.
1561000	1563000	Like, because people act like it's based on logic
1563000	1564000	or something, and it's not...
1564000	1565000	It's just fucking...
1565000	1567000	I'm not a hero either, but, like, stop...
1567000	1571000	Stop dressing up your fucking regular-ass yellow belly
1571000	1573000	with, like, a Spock face, you know?
1573000	1576000	Like, hmm, well, it wouldn't really make sense.
1576000	1578000	Nothing fucking makes sense!
1578000	1580000	It doesn't make sense!
1580000	1581000	Nothing.
1581000	1583000	It's fucking... It's not politics.
1583000	1584000	It's not debate.
1584000	1586000	It's not... It's fucking, like...
1586000	1587000	It's, like...
1587000	1589000	It's fucking scary.
1589000	1591000	You know how all 20-year-olds are dumbasses?
1591000	1595000	Don't you want some dumbasses to be not Nazis?
1595000	1598000	Like, it's kind of easy to be a Nazi
1598000	1599000	when you're a dumbass.
1599000	1601000	We should thank Christ some people
1601000	1603000	who still want to fucking scrap it up
1603000	1606000	actually have the balls to be like,
1606000	1608000	plus, I don't want to be a Nazi.
1608000	1610000	Thank God!
1610000	1611000	Thank you, kids.
1611000	1613000	Like, I really appreciate it,
1613000	1615000	because I'm fucking old. My back hurts.
1615000	1616000	I can't...
1616000	1620000	If I throw a rock, I'm gonna be in a hospital for a week.
1620000	1623000	People's parents will be suing me.
1623000	1625000	You know, I gotta just sit in my house
1625000	1628000	and take shits and...
1628000	1630000	And, you know, I'm just gonna...
1630000	1631000	I'm targeting 60,
1631000	1634000	and I'm just gonna fucking kill myself if I'm not dead.
1634000	1636000	And, like, so just...
1636000	1638000	You're gonna be one of those people
1638000	1640000	that starts saying I'm gonna kill myself in their 40s,
1640000	1642000	and you're gonna end up being 80,
1642000	1643000	and we're all gonna say,
1643000	1645000	fucking didn't do it.
1645000	1648000	Are you encouraging Dan to kill himself?
1649000	1650000	You're gonna be like Dorothy Parker.
1650000	1651000	Oh, yeah? Really?
1651000	1652000	83-year-old Dorothy Parker?
1652000	1654000	Talked a lot of shit back in your 40s
1654000	1656000	about killing yourself.
1656000	1657000	Well, also, if you're 16 and you're listening,
1657000	1658000	don't take that again.
1658000	1661000	It's like, you're having a bad day like I am.
1661000	1662000	Especially if you're one of those
1662000	1665000	autistic Nazi rapists out there.
1665000	1666000	No, no.
1666000	1667000	Don't kill yourself.
1667000	1668000	If you're depressed,
1668000	1669000	this too shall pass.
1669000	1670000	It's a serious issue.
1670000	1674000	You know, a lot of kids write me on my Tumblr.
1674000	1675000	You know?
1675000	1678000	Dan's depression is mostly ear pot based.
1678000	1679000	Like, if anything, kids,
1679000	1681000	if you're depressed right now,
1681000	1683000	just think about it this way.
1683000	1685000	I'm confirming for you at 44
1685000	1688000	that there are bouts of feelings,
1688000	1690000	and I know you don't want to be talked out
1690000	1691000	on how you feel,
1691000	1693000	but I'm just saying this too shall pass.
1693000	1695000	It's like, your moods do control...
1695000	1696000	They're very real.
1696000	1697000	Your feelings are real.
1697000	1699000	They're just not reflective of reality.
1699000	1700000	You know what I mean?
1700000	1702000	Your feelings should be very respected
1702000	1703000	and taken seriously,
1703000	1706000	but then you don't have to like...
1706000	1709000	You can acknowledge that you feel really, really sad
1709000	1711000	and that could be the most important thing
1711000	1712000	going on in your life.
1712000	1715000	You don't have to then connect that to reality
1715000	1716000	by saying, like,
1716000	1717000	therefore I'm going to do this or that.
1717000	1718000	Which, you know,
1718000	1719000	do as I say, not as I do.
1719000	1720000	All right.
1720000	1721000	But, you know, if you're young,
1721000	1722000	I'm saying, you know,
1722000	1724000	you just stick it out.
1724000	1725000	I promise.
1725000	1726000	It's going to be great.
1726000	1727000	Fucking...
1727000	1729000	That's...
1729000	1730000	No, no.
1730000	1731000	It's not going to be great.
1732000	1733000	I'm not...
1733000	1734000	No.
1734000	1736000	That's not the reason to not kill yourself.
1736000	1738000	Life is a fucking shit sandwich.
1738000	1740000	It's not going to end up delicious,
1740000	1742000	but just like eat it and...
1742000	1744000	Because I'm telling you...
1744000	1745000	No, I'm going to kill myself.
1745000	1747000	You fucking...
1747000	1748000	Just...
1748000	1749000	I'm telling you what.
1749000	1751000	I'll be in a better mood again next week
1751000	1752000	and then we'll have fun together
1752000	1753000	eating the shit sandwich.
1753000	1755000	Like, the fire will have moved down here.
1755000	1757000	We'll roast some marshmallows.
1757000	1758000	Do you want to go...
1758000	1760000	Our friends from Texas will now be refugees.
1760000	1762000	It's an ironic twist.
1762000	1764000	Dan, do you...
1764000	1767000	Would it show you up if maybe you could go
1767000	1769000	have a walk in the park with Anne Margaret at some point?
1769000	1770000	Sure, yeah.
1770000	1771000	I can...
1771000	1772000	Yeah.
1772000	1773000	I mean, like...
1773000	1774000	Boy, that magic movie...
1774000	1775000	You gotta watch...
1775000	1776000	Magic!
1776000	1777000	The movie's called Magic.
1777000	1780000	Anthony Hopkins is a magician
1780000	1782000	and he becomes a ventriloquist
1782000	1785000	and he's a wonderful ventriloquist.
1785000	1787000	He's crazy or the doll's real.
1787000	1789000	And then, like, the movie's all over
1789000	1790000	and Cody goes like,
1790000	1792000	wait, I don't understand...
1792000	1794000	Aren't ventriloquist comedians?
1794000	1795000	They're not magicians.
1795000	1796000	I'm like, yeah, that's what...
1796000	1798000	Something off about this movie the whole time.
1798000	1799000	What the fuck?
1799000	1800000	Why was he a magician?
1800000	1802000	And then he, like, picked up a dummy
1802000	1804000	and was like, I'll try this magic trick.
1804000	1806000	That's not the category that ventrilo...
1806000	1807000	It's a comedy act.
1807000	1809000	People were...
1809000	1811000	That movie's weird, man.
1811000	1812000	It's actually...
1812000	1813000	It is worth watching, though.
1813000	1814000	Have you seen Viva Las Vegas?
1814000	1815000	Yeah, of course.
1815000	1816000	Yeah.
1816000	1817000	That movie...
1817000	1818000	Elvis.
1818000	1819000	That movie's pretty insane
1819000	1821000	because there's a big car race at the end.
1821000	1823000	And then people die.
1823000	1824000	There's a big car wreck,
1824000	1826000	but it's this open, like,
1826000	1828000	old-school, hot rod, like, race cars
1828000	1829000	where there's no cockpit.
1829000	1832000	You're just a dude with a helmet sticking out the top.
1832000	1833000	And when you flip over,
1833000	1835000	your head comes off and it's pretty bad.
1835000	1838000	A lot of people seem to crash and burn and die
1838000	1840000	and then it cuts straight to Elvis
1840000	1841000	and Anna Margaret just...
1841000	1843000	Viva Las Vegas!
1843000	1844000	The end credits.
1844000	1845000	That's it.
1845000	1846000	There's no fucking...
1846000	1848000	There's no requiem for all the fucking people
1848000	1849000	that just got murdered.
1849000	1850000	Oh, man.
1850000	1852000	And they don't waste a moment of sadness
1852000	1853000	before they start dancing.
1853000	1856000	That would be amazing if, like, they started dancing
1856000	1857000	and instead of going to the credits,
1857000	1860000	it just, like, slowed down and faded to, like, grayscale
1860000	1864000	and then said, like, it had dates and stuff.
1866000	1868000	All the drivers.
1868000	1870000	Dale Earnhardt.
1870000	1871000	And that was Dale Earnhardt.
1871000	1872000	Senior.
1872000	1873000	Senior.
1873000	1875000	And then the way senior passed away
1875000	1876000	is they were in the same race
1876000	1879000	and he was, like, boxing out his son.
1879000	1882000	His son was in the lead or, like, in second place
1882000	1883000	and his dad was behind him
1883000	1886000	and he was, like, boxing out competitors.
1886000	1887000	Is that true?
1887000	1889000	Like, protecting his son, you know,
1889000	1891000	giving his son some space to...
1891000	1893000	And then he fucking flipped out
1893000	1895000	and got killed and...
1895000	1896000	I don't... Really?
1896000	1898000	And then his son didn't win.
1900000	1901000	But he had an excuse.
1901000	1902000	Like, if anybody was like,
1902000	1905000	you didn't win, he's like, my dad died.
1905000	1906000	Yeah, so you could win.
1906000	1908000	But Dale Jr. was in the race when his father died?
1908000	1909000	I thought, yeah.
1909000	1910000	I don't think so.
1910000	1911000	That's what Mike Waldron told me.
1911000	1912000	Take it up with him.
1912000	1913000	No. Who told you that?
1913000	1915000	Mike Waldron from Atlanta.
1915000	1916000	Oh. I thought you said my brother
1916000	1918000	and I was like, what?
1918000	1919000	No. What are you talking about?
1919000	1921000	No, I think just Dale Sr. went into a wall
1921000	1923000	and he broke his neck and that was that.
1923000	1924000	I don't think Jr. was in the race.
1924000	1925000	Well, I don't think he was...
1925000	1927000	Okay, well, you know,
1927000	1928000	I don't want to fucking argue about it.
1928000	1929000	Is Waldron here?
1929000	1930000	I mean, is it...
1930000	1933000	Any of our Japanese people know about NASCAR as well?
1935000	1936000	Huh?
1936000	1937000	He was in the race.
1937000	1938000	He was in the race.
1938000	1939000	Holy shit.
1939000	1940000	That's fucked up.
1940000	1943000	The way you emphasized was made it seem like
1943000	1945000	you were bursting at the seams to say,
1945000	1947000	but everything else Dan's saying is bullshit.
1947000	1949000	Like, he was in the race.
1949000	1950000	He's backing you up, man.
1950000	1952000	I'm not sure he is.
1953000	1955000	It's kind of a half backup.
1955000	1957000	It's like a hard senior backup.
1957000	1959000	We got to get this mustache off of you.
1959000	1960000	No, I know.
1960000	1962000	We got to get rid of this.
1962000	1964000	I've been thinking that this whole time.
1964000	1966000	It's the mustache.
1966000	1967000	The mustache, yeah.
1967000	1968000	The mustache is fucking...
1968000	1969000	Here's the thing.
1969000	1970000	I just found out.
1970000	1971000	I can't get rid of it.
1971000	1973000	I got to grow my beard around it
1973000	1975000	because they might need me to come back any minute.
1975000	1976000	I'm like a fireman.
1976000	1977000	I'm like on hold.
1978000	1979000	Oh, boy.
1979000	1981000	I got to grow my beard around it.
1981000	1982000	How's that going to work?
1982000	1984000	Isn't the mustache going to always be ahead of the beard?
1984000	1985000	Now, can I...
1985000	1988000	I'm going to look like a schnauzer.
1990000	1991000	Terriers?
1991000	1993000	I don't know which dog I'm thinking of.
1993000	1995000	It's like a Scottish terrier.
1995000	1996000	You're kind of a Scotty.
1996000	1997000	No, I look like a Scottish terrier.
1997000	1999000	Can you bark like a Scottish dog?
1999000	2001000	How would a Scottish dog bark?
2003000	2005000	Like bark with a Scottish accent.
2011000	2013000	I knew you could do it.
2013000	2015000	I knew you could do it.
2015000	2018000	Can I take a little room's attempt to put me in a good mood is pathetic.
2019000	2021000	Everything you've tried sucks.
2021000	2023000	Can I put myself in a good mood because...
2023000	2025000	Well, I was in kind of a shit mood too.
2025000	2027000	I was being grouchy today as well.
2027000	2029000	But I want to talk about your shirt just for a moment
2029000	2034000	because Dan's shirt has a picture of Dorothy Spornak and Blanche.
2034000	2035000	What's her last name?
2035000	2036000	Devereaux.
2036000	2037000	Devereaux.
2037000	2038000	Not Du Bois.
2038000	2039000	I almost said Du Bois too though.
2039000	2040000	It's kind of...
2040000	2041000	From Golden Girls.
2041000	2042000	And it says,
2042000	2044000	Dorothy in the streets, Blanche in the sheets.
2044000	2046000	Now, I think we know where we're coming from.
2046000	2049000	But how are you going to fucking be a tough guy in a bad mood
2049000	2050000	with that shirt on?
2050000	2051000	These are what kids are wearing.
2051000	2054000	I was in a store on Vermont when I was in a good mood
2054000	2055000	when I was like,
2055000	2056000	Hey, I don't have cancer.
2056000	2057000	Kids that...
2057000	2059000	Are fans of the Golden Girls?
2059000	2060000	Yeah.
2060000	2061000	There's like...
2061000	2063000	You go into one of those stores for kids with all the shirts
2063000	2065000	that the sexy kids wear.
2065000	2067000	And there's like a million...
2067000	2071000	Not like...
2071000	2073000	Gap kids.
2073000	2074000	What are your...
2074000	2076000	You go to one of those places where the sexy kids hang out,
2076000	2077000	like...
2077000	2079000	Toys R Us kids or...
2079000	2080000	The library.
2080000	2081000	No, I mean like...
2081000	2082000	Playgrounds?
2082000	2087000	I mean legally voting age sexy kids.
2087000	2088000	They're like...
2088000	2089000	With the shirts are hanging everywhere
2089000	2091000	and there's a lot of Golden Girls shirts.
2091000	2094000	I like to think that it's like a fad with a reason
2094000	2095000	because it's like people maybe...
2095000	2096000	Because I was watching...
2096000	2098000	I watched a couple episodes of Golden Girls
2098000	2100000	and we all know our friend Mitch Hurwitz wrote on that show.
2100000	2102000	That was one of his first jobs.
2102000	2103000	And that writing staff was like...
2103000	2104000	There was other...
2104000	2107000	That was like the Dana Carvey show of its time.
2107000	2109000	Like everybody that wrote on the Golden Girls
2109000	2112000	went on to be a comedy pioneer, I think.
2112000	2113000	I can't remember any other names,
2113000	2115000	so I guess they didn't pioneer shit.
2115000	2118000	But...
2118000	2121000	Tom Wheaton is Josh Wheaton's dad.
2121000	2124000	He worked on Golden Girls?
2124000	2125000	Shit.
2125000	2126000	Bring the Wheaton's into it.
2126000	2129000	Why don't you?
2129000	2132000	There's no highway cones there that I can fuck up.
2132000	2135000	You hear about what happened to that guy?
2135000	2136000	Yeah!
2136000	2139000	You guys want to talk about it at length?
2139000	2142000	Wait, who's...
2142000	2145000	Cody's texting me that might be...
2145000	2152000	Oh, Matt Weiner worked on Golden Girls.
2152000	2153000	Really?
2153000	2154000	Yeah.
2154000	2155000	Wow.
2155000	2157000	Anyways, okay, I lost my place.
2157000	2159000	Thanks, Cody.
2159000	2160000	All right, wait.
2160000	2162000	So what was I just talking about?
2162000	2163000	Golden Girls.
2163000	2164000	No, that was...
2164000	2165000	Sexy kids.
2165000	2167000	You were talking about...
2167000	2169000	You were talking about your love of sexy children.
2169000	2170000	All right, well, have you heard this thing
2170000	2171000	where you're supposed to sneeze into your arm,
2171000	2173000	like didn't know Obama did the PSA?
2173000	2175000	Yeah, you're supposed to dab.
2175000	2182000	Destroy all bacteria.
2182000	2184000	I don't know why that got in applause,
2184000	2186000	and I'm ashamed of this planet.
2186000	2188000	Please tell me you made that up, Spencer.
2188000	2192000	No, I saw it on a school sign.
2192000	2194000	Dabbing can take a flying fuck, right?
2194000	2195000	Yeah.
2195000	2196000	What is that?
2196000	2198000	I know you're trolling me,
2198000	2199000	but I'm supposed to go,
2199000	2200000	what's with this dabbing?
2200000	2203000	But fuck you, and then fuck you.
2203000	2205000	Like, I will say what's with this dabbing,
2205000	2207000	and I'm still smarter than you.
2207000	2209000	But then you got that marijuana dabbing, Spencer.
2209000	2211000	What's a marijuana dab all about?
2211000	2215000	That's when you take like a lump of hash oil
2215000	2220000	and you vaporize it and take a hit off of that.
2220000	2221000	Yeah.
2221000	2224000	I got some fans of that in the audience.
2224000	2228000	Also, sand dabs are a kind of Pacific Ocean fish.
2228000	2230000	Yeah, those are grass.
2230000	2233000	Yeah, yeah.
2233000	2234000	Sand dab?
2234000	2235000	What are those things called?
2235000	2236000	Sand dab?
2236000	2239000	Those fucking, those chunky, flavorless things
2239000	2241000	that you get in seafood.
2241000	2242000	What are those things called?
2242000	2243000	Tofu.
2243000	2245000	Not tofu.
2245000	2246000	Wait, start again?
2246000	2248000	They're like scallops.
2248000	2249000	Scallops.
2249000	2250000	Fuck scallops.
2250000	2251000	You don't like scallops?
2251000	2253000	Fuck scallops or natures?
2253000	2255000	Chicken nuggets.
2255000	2257000	They're so good.
2257000	2258000	Scallops.
2258000	2259000	Fuck scallops.
2259000	2260000	You know what?
2260000	2261000	What's your beef with scallops?
2261000	2262000	Fuck senior citizens.
2262000	2263000	No, I'm kidding.
2263000	2264000	Yeah.
2264000	2265000	You got me back.
2265000	2268000	I tried sneezing into my arm fold today.
2268000	2269000	What happened?
2269000	2270000	Okay, I get it.
2270000	2272000	I understand the general concept
2272000	2275000	is that now my hands don't have sneeze on them.
2275000	2276000	Yeah.
2276000	2277000	But guess what does?
2277000	2278000	The entire restaurant.
2278000	2279000	What do you do?
2279000	2281000	I put my face in my arm and sneezed,
2281000	2283000	and the sneeze just went everywhere.
2283000	2284000	Yeah, it's hard to get your...
2284000	2285000	It's stupid.
2285000	2286000	I hate it.
2286000	2287000	I hate everyone.
2287000	2288000	Don't sneeze.
2288000	2289000	Just stifle it.
2289000	2291000	Make it go inside of your head like I do.
2291000	2295000	The bonus is you might get an aneurysm.
2295000	2299000	Can we talk about Angry Birds rip-offs?
2299000	2300000	Oh, yeah.
2300000	2301000	Yeah.
2301000	2302000	Oh, man.
2302000	2303000	Hit the theme song.
2303000	2304000	Wait.
2304000	2305000	I'm sorry.
2305000	2306000	Angry Birds.
2306000	2307000	Angry Birds rip-offs?
2307000	2308000	Yeah.
2308000	2309000	Yeah.
2309000	2310000	All right.
2310000	2311000	You want some music for this?
2311000	2312000	Yeah, this is it.
2312000	2313000	Yeah, we did.
2313000	2314000	There was a game called Angry Birds,
2314000	2317000	and then there were five games called Angry Birds,
2317000	2321000	and there's also 20 games that try to trick you into things
2321000	2322000	that you don't know.
2322000	2325000	And then there were five games called Angry Birds,
2325000	2329000	and there's also 20 games that try to trick you into things
2329000	2332000	that trick you into thinking they're Angry Birds games.
2332000	2334000	Well, let's try that theme song again,
2334000	2337000	but now sing the whole thing.
2337000	2338000	We did it.
2338000	2340000	No, that's not the right one.
2340000	2341000	Fuck it.
2341000	2347000	Angry Birds was a game where you
2347000	2352000	played a bird in twos and blocks and knocked him over.
2352000	2355000	All right.
2355000	2357000	So there's like many-
2358000	2361000	Real quick, how would a different Scottish dog bark?
2361000	2363000	There's two Scottish dogs,
2363000	2364000	and one goes,
2364000	2367000	What's the other Scottish-
2372000	2375000	Stop trying to cheer me up.
2375000	2379000	Dan, don't pretend to be grumpy when you're that delightful.
2379000	2380000	Society's a lie.
2380000	2382000	You're being delightful.
2382000	2385000	The anarchists were right the whole time.
2386000	2391000	I'm gonna get an Antifa tattoo and then ask them what they are.
2391000	2394000	Just like people do with Pickle Rick and stuff.
2394000	2396000	I'm just gonna get a tattoo of Antifa
2396000	2398000	and then take it to a convention and go,
2398000	2399000	Look.
2403000	2407000	I have no problems with people that get tattoos and stuff.
2407000	2409000	I used one when I was in my 20s.
2409000	2410000	I would be like,
2410000	2411000	Oh, what are you doing that for?
2411000	2412000	I explained that last week.
2412000	2413000	I've come around on you kids.
2413000	2414000	You're great.
2414000	2420000	You should attach a third arm to your chest.
2420000	2422000	It's a fucking world's ending, man.
2422000	2426000	Just don't hurt anybody else or yourself.
2426000	2429000	Make sure that was a consensual arm that you got.
2429000	2432000	Get it from a store or something.
2432000	2436000	Don't get it from your parents.
2436000	2438000	Get two from your parents if you can.
2438000	2440000	That's privilege.
2440000	2447000	Get a third one from maybe a, you know, I don't know.
2447000	2451000	Some kind of stem cell.
2451000	2452000	So, okay.
2452000	2454000	So there's this game.
2454000	2455000	So there's Angry Birds.
2455000	2456000	There's Angry Birds 2.
2456000	2457000	There's Star Wars Angry Birds.
2457000	2459000	There's Star Wars Angry Birds 2.
2459000	2461000	There's Angry Birds Transformers.
2461000	2462000	There's Angry Birds Transformers.
2462000	2464000	These are all Angry Birds.
2464000	2465000	Hey, you made a game.
2465000	2466000	It's very successful.
2466000	2468000	Keep making, build your empire.
2468000	2473000	I have no beef with capitalism.
2473000	2479000	But this guy, I can't pronounce his name.
2479000	2483000	Challa, if you go to the app store and type in Angry Birds and start scrolling down,
2483000	2493000	you will soon come to a sea of con artistry from someone named Challapop Cajon Cakachitiki.
2493000	2495000	That better be right.
2496000	2502000	His games include Bomber Birds Angry Land.
2502000	2508000	Hockey Birds The Angry Sports Tournament.
2508000	2514000	Racing Birds Real Road Car Angry Driver.
2514000	2516000	These are all the same guy.
2516000	2517000	Are they good games?
2517000	2520000	I'm not going to download them.
2520000	2522000	I looked at one of the reviews of the last one.
2522000	2524000	When I get to the last one, I'll read one review.
2524000	2528000	Ninja Birds The Angry Dungeon.
2528000	2532000	You're not fooling anybody.
2532000	2536000	Jewel Birds Angry Blast Dungeon.
2536000	2542000	Warrior Birds The Destroy Angry Soldiers.
2542000	2543000	Dan, are you reading these wrong?
2543000	2548000	No.
2548000	2553000	Fisher Birds Feeding in Angry Aquatic.
2553000	2555000	Birds and Blocks 2.
2555000	2556000	That's not him.
2556000	2559000	This is just a person doing Angry Birds.
2559000	2560000	Birds and Blocks 2.
2560000	2561000	They're not angry.
2561000	2562000	They're like regular birds.
2562000	2563000	They're placid.
2563000	2565000	But they're shaped exactly like Angry Birds.
2565000	2566000	They're just not angry.
2566000	2568000	It's called Birds and Blocks 2.
2568000	2573000	Magic Birds Marvelous Angry Territory Pop.
2573000	2577000	And of course, the best of them all.
2577000	2581000	The one with a title that doesn't even fit in the app store.
2581000	2583000	There's nowhere you can get the full title.
2583000	2586000	Even if you click on it, it doesn't expand enough for you
2586000	2589000	to ever see the end of the title.
2589000	2593000	Angry Ninja Paratrooper Pilot versus Birds Free Game,
2593000	2600000	colon, Zero Injustice 2.
2600000	2604000	These are all programmed games that you could potentially buy?
2604000	2605000	Yeah.
2605000	2606000	And this guy did.
2606000	2608000	There's one review of that one.
2608000	2612000	And the guy says, the headline of the review is, they tried.
2612000	2616000	And his review is, his review is,
2616000	2619000	I downloaded this app as a joke.
2619000	2625000	And three stars.
2625000	2628000	That's not bad.
2628000	2629000	Just think.
2629000	2632000	I mean, that guy should be ashamed of himself, right?
2632000	2634000	Chalet Pop?
2634000	2635000	Yeah, Chalet Pop.
2636000	2638000	It's a great name.
2638000	2641000	It's like, Monta Chaitiki.
2641000	2643000	There's one fly in this fucking movie.
2643000	2644000	I know.
2644000	2648000	This episode is like, it's the fly of Breaking Bad.
2648000	2649000	But us.
2649000	2650000	Wait, wait.
2650000	2651000	OK.
2651000	2652000	So where do you guys stand in this?
2652000	2653000	OK.
2653000	2661000	So if you're on a freeway, and you're in a car,
2661000	2669000	as I hope you are, or you're Martin Lawrence,
2669000	2672000	if someone is pulling up next to you,
2672000	2675000	if there's a person, there's a stranger in another car,
2675000	2678000	I think you can visualize this.
2678000	2682000	So there are some people that you're like,
2682000	2686000	you'll pick your nose freely.
2686000	2689000	And your justification for it is logical,
2689000	2691000	which is that you're never going to see that person again.
2691000	2692000	Right.
2692000	2693000	Fuck them.
2693000	2697000	But I want to be one of those people that's like, well,
2697000	2698000	I don't care.
2698000	2700000	I'm never going to see that person again.
2700000	2701000	I'm going to pick my nose.
2701000	2705000	But I punish the people that are my friends.
2705000	2708000	I'm only gross in front of them.
2708000	2711000	It doesn't really make any sense.
2711000	2713000	I care so much what strangers think of me.
2713000	2715000	And it's another reason to just hate myself.
2715000	2718000	It's fucking stupid.
2718000	2720000	Why do we care what strangers think?
2720000	2725000	But when people become friends with us, then we're like,
2725000	2726000	oh, fuck this guy.
2726000	2728000	I'll fart.
2728000	2730000	We should be like, thank you so much for being my friend.
2730000	2733000	I'm going to go in the other room and pick my nose now,
2733000	2736000	and then in front of a stranger.
2736000	2739000	And if the person's like, hey, you're picking your nose in front of me,
2739000	2743000	you'd be like, yeah, we'll make friends with me, dickbag.
2743000	2746000	Maybe I'll treat you with some respect.
2746000	2747000	Give me a chance.
2747000	2748000	Stranger.
2748000	2750000	There's a story, I'll get it all wrong,
2750000	2752000	but it was like James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart
2752000	2753000	were both up for the same role,
2753000	2756000	and there was some kind of studio dispute on it.
2756000	2757000	And they were having some kind of rivalry,
2757000	2758000	but who was the biggest star?
2758000	2762000	And I don't want to take that guy's role if he already passed on it,
2762000	2764000	because it lowers my fucking status or whatever the fuck.
2764000	2768000	But apparently Humphrey Bogart saw James Cagney
2768000	2770000	like driving down the street in Hollywood,
2770000	2772000	picking his nose in the back of his limousine.
2772000	2776000	And it's either Cagney sent a poem to Bogart or vice versa.
2776000	2779000	I think Bogart wrote a poem and sent it to Cagney
2779000	2783000	about how famous people shouldn't pick their noses.
2783000	2787000	He fucking nose pick shamed him in a poem and sent it to him.
2787000	2789000	Like roses are red, violets are blue,
2789000	2791000	you picked your nose and I saw you.
2791000	2792000	Like famous people...
2792000	2794000	You dirty rat.
2794000	2796000	Famous people...
2798000	2800000	Famous people driving in famous places
2800000	2802000	shouldn't go around picking their famous faces.
2802000	2803000	Something like that.
2803000	2806000	He's like, I saw you picking your nose, motherfucker.
2806000	2807000	Something like that.
2807000	2808000	Look it up.
2808000	2809000	PCM.
2809000	2810000	Fridays.
2810000	2812000	Fucking fly is going to get it.
2812000	2814000	It's just on your face.
2818000	2820000	Remember that fly that landed on that guy's face in Indiana Jones
2820000	2822000	and he just crawled in his mouth and he ate it?
2824000	2828000	You know, they had to dribble an invisible trail of fly food
2828000	2830000	up his chin to get that shot.
2830000	2832000	It took three days.
2832000	2834000	400 takes and 7,000 flies.
2834000	2836000	How good is your fucking prop department
2836000	2838000	when they know where to get invisible fly food?
2838000	2840000	They got everything.
2841000	2845000	So anyways, I was in another car
2845000	2847000	with an unnamed ride share server.
2847000	2850000	Top five Dan Harmon car stories.
2853000	2856000	And the guy said, what do you want to listen to?
2856000	2857000	I said, whatever you want to listen to.
2857000	2858000	And he's like, okay.
2858000	2862000	And he cranks this dating tips for Christian men show.
2863000	2865000	Which I didn't even know existed.
2865000	2867000	It doesn't even make any sense to me.
2867000	2870000	And it was like this white guy on the radio
2870000	2873000	talking to another guy and just being like,
2873000	2875000	yeah, here's the thing, man.
2875000	2879000	Believe me, women are hungry for good men.
2879000	2881000	Ask any woman.
2881000	2884000	I can't tell you how many times, bro,
2884000	2887000	that I've heard a woman say, where are all the good men?
2887000	2888000	Well, guess what?
2888000	2890000	You put your faith in Jesus Christ.
2890000	2892000	You're going to be a good man.
2892000	2894000	And it's your market, bro.
2894000	2898000	It's like, you know, you need a real man as a mentor.
2898000	2900000	Jesus Christ was a real man.
2900000	2901000	It was so weird.
2901000	2905000	It was such a weird mix of red pill and Christianity.
2908000	2911000	He didn't say like Jesus smashed puss,
2911000	2914000	but that's what he was implying.
2914000	2916000	Like Jesus will help you smash puss.
2916000	2918000	He said, be a fisher of puss.
2918000	2922000	He said, I hashtag my, when I Instagram about it,
2922000	2925000	I said, I follow me and I will make you crushers of puss.
2928000	2930000	But I felt like I was like a game of chicken.
2930000	2932000	I couldn't tell if he was really Christian
2932000	2934000	or if he was trying to be like, don't be lazy
2934000	2936000	when I ask you what you want to hear.
2936000	2938000	And so I was like, I'm going to fucking be Christian now
2938000	2940000	and crush Christian puss.
2940000	2942000	Like, I'm going to just be like, hmm, this is great.
2942000	2943000	Just to punish him.
2943000	2946000	Like, let's see how long he could sweat it out.
2946000	2948000	So we just both like.
2948000	2951000	This is a game of radio chicken.
2951000	2952000	How long is your ride?
2952000	2955000	Listen to this for 10 minutes, you piece of shit.
2955000	2958000	The guy said, you got to work on your inner game.
2958000	2959000	That's true.
2959000	2960000	Don't we all?
2960000	2962000	Yeah.
2962000	2964000	You would think at least a Christian guy would be like,
2964000	2966000	what can we drop the game part?
2966000	2967000	Like, it's not a game.
2967000	2968000	You've figured out.
2969000	2970000	You're Christian, but it's still.
2970000	2972000	Well, you got to play those ladies, man.
2972000	2974000	You got to fucking trick them into fucking you.
2974000	2976000	Still?
2976000	2979000	You've accepted the Lord Christ into your heart.
2979000	2981000	Like, answered the door on which he knocks
2981000	2982000	and you've heard the good news
2982000	2986000	and you're like washed in the lamb of the Savior's blood.
2986000	2987000	But you just still.
2987000	2988000	Fuck women.
2988000	2990000	Like, just fuck them.
2990000	2991000	Fuck.
2991000	2992000	That's Satan.
2992000	2995000	That fly is actually the devil.
2995000	2997000	That fly is on your ass.
2998000	3002000	I would serve that fly right if I let it land
3002000	3006000	and take a big drink of my fucking pores.
3006000	3008000	You're going to watch that thing fall down
3008000	3011000	and just crawl away.
3011000	3012000	God damn it.
3015000	3016000	It kind of took a dive.
3016000	3018000	I'm going to let it land right away.
3018000	3020000	I'm not going to freak out if it lands on my face.
3020000	3023000	It's almost blank on the sheets.
3023000	3024000	It's right in your tum tum.
3024000	3026000	It's right in your tummy.
3026000	3027000	It's going on your dick.
3027000	3028000	It's on your dick.
3028000	3029000	Oh, no.
3029000	3030000	On your dick.
3030000	3031000	On your dick.
3031000	3032000	Oh, no.
3032000	3034000	Fly your dick.
3034000	3035000	Please tell me you got it.
3035000	3037000	It's on his leg now.
3037000	3038000	Oh, my God.
3038000	3039000	The fly was on your dick.
3039000	3040000	It's on the floor.
3040000	3041000	One fly.
3041000	3043000	Sneezing into your arm is bullshit.
3043000	3045000	Burbank's on fire.
3045000	3047000	Can't live in the desert because there's no water.
3047000	3048000	Angry birds rip offs.
3048000	3049000	Facetiming in public.
3049000	3050000	Perception of strangers.
3050000	3053000	Private chauffeur business cards.
3053000	3055000	One guy, this guy, the Christian dating guy,
3055000	3057000	when he dropped me off, he gave me a business card.
3057000	3061000	And he said, I do everything from limo rides to private jets.
3061000	3063000	Private jets.
3063000	3065000	Eating chips for Christian men.
3065000	3067000	I quit Twitter for a while.
3067000	3068000	I'm feeling good about that.
3068000	3071000	But the mustache, obviously, has got me like, you know,
3071000	3073000	it's like, yeah, I don't know.
3073000	3075000	I don't know what's happening to me.
3075000	3078000	Well, you said the mustache brought you back into Twitter?
3078000	3081000	No, I mean, the mustache is making me as angry as I was
3081000	3082000	when I was on Twitter, I guess.
3082000	3083000	I don't know.
3083000	3084000	I don't know what's happening to me.
3084000	3086000	The mustache is what people did before Twitter.
3086000	3088000	Yeah.
3088000	3090000	He flew private jets?
3090000	3091000	Yeah.
3091000	3094000	It's like overqualified.
3094000	3096000	Why is he driving you around?
3096000	3097000	Yeah.
3097000	3100000	And his car didn't even have a charging port.
3100000	3103000	Spencer, that's like an airplane.
3103000	3106000	Spencer, it sounds to me like you've got to work on your inner game, bro.
3106000	3107000	Yeah, man.
3107000	3109000	I'm always working on my inner game.
3109000	3112000	It turns out that we're all light.
3112000	3113000	That's a throwback.
3113000	3117000	And if you're dirty inside, then it looks, you know, bad.
3117000	3119000	It's like dirty light.
3119000	3123000	Jesus, why was there only one pair of footprints there?
3123000	3125000	That's when I was wingman in you.
3131000	3134000	Shouldn't there have been a woman there with me?
3137000	3142000	Shouldn't there have been three pairs?
3142000	3145000	Three pairs or at least two pairs of footprints there?
3145000	3147000	I was carrying her.
3147000	3148000	Whoa!
3148000	3149000	Whoa!
3149000	3150000	Not cool, man.
3150000	3152000	I was flying and carrying her.
3152000	3153000	I'm the best wingman ever.
3153000	3156000	Sounds like you're an abductor?
3156000	3159000	An alien abductor?
3159000	3162000	This fucking fly.
3162000	3165000	Now I can't tell the difference between flies and sweat drips.
3165000	3168000	So for all I know, there's just flies all over me.
3168000	3169000	There he is.
3169000	3170000	There he is.
3170000	3173000	This is the fucker.
3173000	3176000	This is the show.
3176000	3177000	Eat it.
3177000	3181000	Eat this fucker.
3181000	3185000	I have Godfather 2 questions.
3185000	3187000	Lay them on me.
3187000	3190000	You know, people act like this is the best movie ever.
3190000	3191000	Okay, so all right.
3191000	3192000	So remember Godfather 2.
3192000	3194000	You get a little back story.
3194000	3198000	Robert De Niro plays the Godfather in his youth.
3198000	3202000	You get to see him go from a regular father to a Godfather.
3202000	3207000	And the way he does it is, see, this is why you're not Godfathers.
3207000	3211000	Because here's what Vito Corleone does.
3211000	3212000	I'm going to get you.
3212000	3219000	You got to go in from back.
3219000	3225000	You got to work on your fly game.
3225000	3229000	For $5 a month, you can watch Dan be tormented by a fly.
3229000	3231000	Yeah, that's this episode.
3231000	3234000	Isn't there a room full of Juju beads over there?
3234000	3236000	Is it Juju beads or Juju?
3236000	3237000	I'm getting no love from the fly.
3237000	3238000	It's on you.
3238000	3239000	That's a good point.
3239000	3243000	If we pour soda on the ground, maybe it'll distract him.
3243000	3246000	Everybody pours soda on the ground.
3246000	3247000	Or just take a shit.
3247000	3250000	I should just poop.
3250000	3254000	That's kind of, you know, I mean, I'm sure a lot of stand-ups talk about this.
3254000	3257000	But you're walking by a pile of shit, and the flies are on it.
3257000	3260000	And then you get too close to the shit, and the flies are like, whoa!
3260000	3263000	They fly away.
3263000	3265000	They're embarrassed?
3265000	3266000	Well, no.
3266000	3268000	They're like, look out!
3268000	3270000	Someone's coming to nothing, man.
3270000	3272000	You're fine.
3272000	3273000	You keep eating shit.
3273000	3275000	I was not going to give anything to you.
3275000	3276000	I think it's just shame.
3276000	3277000	They're like, oh, man.
3277000	3280000	I like shit, but I don't want everyone to know it.
3280000	3281000	These are humans.
3281000	3283000	They have newspapers and internet and shit.
3283000	3285000	I'm going to be telling everybody I'm a fucking shit lover.
3285000	3290000	So Vito Corleone, the godfather, he's just a regular guy.
3290000	3297000	He's emigrated to America from Italy, where he was persecuted as a child.
3297000	3300000	And he's grown up in Italy.
3300000	3303000	And he's an adult now.
3303000	3306000	And then it's like, oh, there's this guy.
3306000	3308000	And he's like the mafia king of the neighborhood.
3308000	3312000	And he's like, no, everybody give me some of the, let me wet my beak.
3312000	3317000	And then Vito Corleone's like, what's with that guy?
3317000	3320000	And then his friends are like, dude, you don't fuck with that guy.
3320000	3322000	That guy, he owns everything.
3322000	3323000	This is his neighborhood.
3323000	3325000	You can't fuck with that guy.
3325000	3326000	It's crazy.
3326000	3332000	He's the charge of, there's a guy above him.
3332000	3333000	He's the black hand.
3333000	3334000	He's the mafia.
3334000	3335000	You can't fuck with that guy.
3335000	3338000	And Vito Corleone's like, huh, wow.
3338000	3339000	That's tough.
3339000	3343000	I wish there was some way to do this.
3343000	3346000	It's like, you've got to give this guy all your money.
3346000	3350000	And then he just shoots him.
3350000	3356000	And then it's just like, that's it, that he just takes over.
3356000	3357000	I don't think that's it.
3357000	3359000	I mean, you just shoot the guy?
3359000	3362000	No one thought of that?
3362000	3363000	That's what it takes to be a godfather?
3363000	3366000	It must be nice.
3366000	3367000	It's like rap in the 80s.
3367000	3373000	It could just fucking, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
3373000	3377000	You could be a mafia guy by just killing one guy every 30 years.
3377000	3379000	Yeah, but then you've got to be good at not being killed.
3379000	3382000	You've got to be the guy that doesn't get killed that easy.
3382000	3385000	Yeah, why didn't the first guy think of that, though?
3385000	3387000	This guy lived alone in an apartment.
3387000	3389000	And he just walked up the stairs.
3389000	3391000	And he's like, Robert De Niro, what are you doing here?
3391000	3392000	And he's like, shooting you.
3392000	3395000	And then the guy's like, oh, I can't believe this happened.
3395000	3401000	All I did was take everybody's money and it's just kind of silly.
3401000	3403000	And the godfather movies, every time you see an orange,
3403000	3404000	someone's about to die.
3404000	3405000	Have you noticed that?
3405000	3407000	There's always a thing about oranges.
3407000	3408000	Anyone know why that is?
3408000	3409000	Is that just arbitrary and weird ass?
3409000	3413000	I hear it's the new black.
3413000	3414000	Nice.
3414000	3415000	Yay.
3415000	3416000	Nice.
3416000	3417000	He's right on my thumb.
3417000	3418000	He's on par with this.
3418000	3419000	I miss Shrav so much.
3419000	3423000	Yeah.
3424000	3425000	Did you get it?
3425000	3427000	I don't think so.
3427000	3429000	If you kill this fly, I'm going to fucking freak out.
3429000	3430000	That's the thing.
3430000	3432000	Well, if I put my phone down, which I think I can't know,
3432000	3433000	I got everything.
3433000	3435000	Maybe this fly is entertainment's way of saying,
3435000	3438000	put your phone down and be in the moment.
3438000	3440000	That would be weird.
3447000	3452000	This is like the opening act of Remo Williams, The Adventure Continues.
3454000	3456000	See, the fly's not going to come out.
3456000	3459000	The fly's like, this guy's activated.
3459000	3462000	This guy looks like a stone-cold fly killer.
3462000	3468000	I can land on anybody holding a drink and an iPhone.
3468000	3474000	So here's one last thing that I'm just like, I just say,
3474000	3476000	and then I won't be in a bad mood anymore
3476000	3479000	because I just want to get this all out.
3479000	3481000	Fucking medical forms.
3481000	3485000	When you go to a new doctor or a new dentist or anything,
3485000	3487000	how lazy are these people?
3487000	3491000	They give you 90 pieces of paper
3491000	3494000	and they all ask the same questions over and over again.
3494000	3496000	You're going to write your social security number.
3496000	3499000	Why do they get your social security number?
3499000	3501000	Isn't that an important number?
3501000	3503000	Isn't that supposed to be something that if someone else has it,
3503000	3508000	they can steal your life and send you to prison in Istanbul or something?
3508000	3514000	If anybody just breaks into one shitty dentist office,
3514000	3516000	they can have everybody's social security number
3516000	3520000	because they just found that to be a convenient way to sort people's files.
3520000	3522000	You can't ask.
3522000	3525000	Everything's just like, oh, give me your name and your address
3525000	3528000	and your date of birth 500 times on the same form.
3528000	3531000	Just fucking look up.
3531000	3533000	It's the same form.
3533000	3536000	The forms are all sloppy and shitty.
3536000	3538000	They're all misspelled.
3538000	3540000	You can't tell what you're supposed to write where.
3540000	3542000	It's fucking lazy, man.
3542000	3544000	Lazy shit.
3544000	3547000	We have better technology than that and they can just get away with it
3547000	3549000	because they're like, oh, your tooth hurts.
3549000	3551000	Fill out 900 things and then you just got to fill it all out
3551000	3553000	and you can't go get your tooth fixed.
3553000	3555000	You're just like, goddamn, dude.
3555000	3557000	I wrote my birth date 500 times.
3557000	3559000	You don't know when I was born yet?
3559000	3561000	Fuck you.
3561000	3563000	Fucking assholes.
3563000	3565000	This is shit.
3565000	3567000	Uh-oh.
3567000	3569000	Here comes this fly.
3569000	3571000	The fly's going to come right back.
3571000	3574000	Dave Votay's of my Instagram already know this,
3574000	3577000	but listen to this shit on this form.
3577000	3580000	This is the form I have to fill out to get my teeth cleaned.
3580000	3584000	On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest rating,
3584000	3587000	how important is your dental health to you?
3587000	3589000	The fuck?
3589000	3594000	So if I put one, are they going to be like, all right, we'll leave.
3594000	3599000	Or are they going to be like, thank you for being on it?
3599000	3601000	If you put five, why do they care?
3601000	3603000	Clean my teeth.
3603000	3606000	Clean it with all you got.
3606000	3609000	No matter what I say, I don't care how important my...
3609000	3614000	What is your fluoride hose hooked up to my desires to have clean teeth?
3614000	3617000	Was it powered by my fucking ambition?
3617000	3619000	Like the spirit of dental hygiene?
3619000	3622000	What am I, a care bear with a tooth on his belly?
3622000	3628000	Like you need my fucking tooth, tooth, tooth face to fucking run the thing?
3628000	3629000	What if I have leukemia?
3629000	3630000	Like guess what?
3630000	3631000	My teeth aren't that important.
3631000	3632000	Still need them clean.
3632000	3633000	I have leukemia.
3633000	3635000	Want to be able to eat a fucking hoagie?
3635000	3636000	Fix my teeth.
3636000	3638000	But one, one, really?
3638000	3644000	I'd like white blood cells more than anything.
3644000	3646000	Is that going to be okay?
3647000	3648000	Marsha?
3648000	3649000	DDS?
3649000	3651000	Whatever the fuck that stands for.
3651000	3653000	What would a Scottish cat sound like?
3653000	3655000	How would that...
3655000	3657000	Me.
3657000	3658000	All right.
3658000	3662000	Well, you had to keep pushing.
3662000	3665000	Where would you rate your current dental health?
3665000	3667000	Again, what the fuck?
3667000	3668000	Why are you asking me?
3668000	3670000	You're a dentist.
3670000	3671000	Five?
3671000	3673000	I don't know.
3673000	3675000	I came to a dentist.
3675000	3676000	Ten.
3676000	3677000	Ten.
3677000	3679000	So I can eat shit when I go in there.
3679000	3680000	You got to go to my dentist.
3680000	3681000	You're the coolest man.
3681000	3684000	A bunch of Scandinavian ladies who are just cool as shit.
3684000	3685000	And then the third question.
3685000	3688000	Where do you want your dental health to be?
3688000	3690000	Oh, give me an eight.
3690000	3693000	Oh, I get greedy.
3693000	3695000	So fucking dumb.
3695000	3696000	That is dumb.
3696000	3697000	Chiropractor does the same thing.
3697000	3699000	He had me fill out a thing.
3699000	3702000	How important is you having a good back and all this shit?
3702000	3704000	What are you trying to catch me in a...
3704000	3707000	Because you said that when I say I didn't do my back exercises,
3707000	3709000	you can be like, well, you're not going to get to attend that way
3709000	3712000	and you didn't say you wanted that.
3712000	3714000	Just fix my back.
3714000	3717000	I learned to not be honest on those things now
3717000	3720000	because one time on a TV show a long time ago,
3720000	3722000	I was honest about whether or not I'd ever tried drugs,
3722000	3723000	and I said yes.
3723000	3726000	And then a team of lawyers came from the studio.
3726000	3730000	A major studio came, and I had to fucking deal with a big-ass law,
3730000	3733000	like kerfuffle, and fill in a bunch of shit.
3733000	3737000	I was like, look at the rest of this cast.
3737000	3740000	They're all from Chicago from the 80s.
3740000	3743000	If you don't think they all didn't eat their weight and coke every afternoon,
3743000	3745000	you're out of your fucking minds.
3745000	3748000	I talked to some of these older actors like, oh, no, no,
3748000	3750000	you never say yes on that shit.
3750000	3753000	I was like, oh, terrific.
3753000	3754000	Fucking doctors.
3754000	3757000	Fucking people.
3757000	3760000	I go back in for another endoscopy.
3760000	3762000	They upsold me on another one.
3762000	3763000	I'm like, this is fine.
3763000	3767000	I went in because I was like, oh, I've been taking Prilosec every day
3767000	3768000	for my heartburn.
3768000	3769000	That can't be good.
3769000	3770000	I just heard it's linked to Alzheimer's.
3770000	3773000	Then I went into the thing, and the guy's like, well, here's the thing.
3773000	3774000	Or I told you that.
3774000	3775000	I went to my doctor.
3775000	3778000	I said, hey, man, I've been taking Prilosec for a really long time,
3778000	3781000	and I see on the box it says you're not supposed to take it that much.
3781000	3783000	And I heard this study.
3783000	3785000	It says it's linked to Alzheimer's and stuff.
3785000	3788000	And he's like, well, didn't I refer you to that one guy?
3788000	3789000	I'm like, yeah.
3789000	3793000	Remember, you guys started obsessing about my lymph nodes
3793000	3796000	and gave me a biopsy and told me I had sarcoidosis.
3796000	3798000	And then I was like, so what's with my heartburn?
3798000	3800000	And you were like, I don't know.
3800000	3803000	And so I'm like, okay, so for real, it's been okay.
3803000	3804000	What about my heartburn?
3804000	3807000	And my doctor goes, he goes, hey, listen, so go back to that guy.
3807000	3809000	But listen, this time when you talk to him,
3809000	3812000	just stay on the heartburn topic.
3812000	3814000	Don't get distracted.
3814000	3817000	I'm like, me?
3817000	3818000	Maybe so mad.
3818000	3820000	It's like victim blaming, you know?
3820000	3823000	Like, I got it bad.
3823000	3824000	Your lesson nightmare.
3824000	3828000	Hashtag heartburn culture.
3828000	3830000	This is like he blamed me.
3830000	3833000	Like he implied that like, oh, you know, this is like he's basically saying,
3833000	3836000	oh, Dan, you know how you could babble when you go to the doctor.
3836000	3842000	So maybe it's your fault that we went off on some weird fucking expensive tangent
3842000	3845000	with MRIs, like making sure you don't have lymphatic cancer
3845000	3846000	instead of telling you about your heartburn.
3846000	3849000	Remember that sound I make?
3849000	3852000	It's like I'm doing it right now.
3852000	3853000	I don't know.
3853000	3854000	Sometimes it comes back.
3854000	3855000	But it's like that was the thing.
3855000	3856000	At the end of it all, I'm like, so what?
3856000	3858000	So is that what made that sound, the sarcoidosis?
3858000	3860000	And they're like, I don't know what makes that sound.
3860000	3861000	Fucking jerks.
3861000	3864000	It's like a Louis bit.
3864000	3866000	So Dan, Dan, what?
3866000	3868000	You're not being very Dorothy in the streets about this.
3868000	3870000	You've got to be a little bit more Dorothy in the streets.
3870000	3871000	I hate everyone.
3871000	3874000	I feel like I've wasted my life trying to impress people
3875000	3880000	and all you guys ever did was beat me up and make fun of me
3880000	3885000	and then I made up enough money to make that stop happening
3885000	3888000	and now you've got Nazis.
3888000	3890000	You can't blame yourself for that.
3890000	3891000	Hey, that's crazy.
3891000	3892000	There's Nazis.
3892000	3893000	We should do something about that.
3893000	3897000	And then you people are like, oh, you know,
3897000	3899000	communists kill more people than the Nazis.
3899000	3905000	You fucking 20-year-old dickhead, stupid fucking moron.
3905000	3908000	Everyone's so fucking stupid.
3908000	3910000	The average IQ is 100.
3910000	3913000	So why did I ever get tricked into caring about young people?
3913000	3914000	I don't care.
3914000	3915000	I don't care.
3915000	3917000	I'm not a naturally caring person.
3917000	3921000	I just want to make little music videos.
3921000	3927000	I know I'm going to get foot cancer or something.
3927000	3930000	Any day now I'm going to get, you know,
3930000	3933000	I've got my health right now and I should be happy
3933000	3935000	and I've got everything that everybody wants
3935000	3938000	and I'm just pissing around my house,
3938000	3940000	yelling at my dog for eating my underwear
3940000	3942000	and a big scowl on my face.
3942000	3945000	There's a dude chasing an alligator out of his living room in Texas
3945000	3948000	and he's probably laughing about it and having a better life than me.
3948000	3949000	I've been fucking had.
3949000	3950000	I've been had.
3950000	3951000	I've been had by God.
3951000	3952000	I've been had by society.
3952000	3954000	I've been had by morons.
3954000	3956000	I just want to watch forensic.
3956000	3959000	The exits are two to the front, two to the side.
3959000	3963000	I'm glad Burbank's on fire.
3963000	3965000	I deserve it.
3965000	3968000	Hope all your Burbank crops burn.
3968000	3971000	Was there one event like today or yesterday,
3971000	3972000	like one little small?
3972000	3973000	I lost my AirPods.
3973000	3974000	That was what, that set me off?
3974000	3975000	That was a tipping point?
3975000	3976000	Yeah.
3976000	3978000	And then I had a candle in my hand looking for my AirPods
3978000	3984000	and I threw it out the window in Burbank.
3984000	3986000	Fucking knew it.
3986000	3990000	You don't think, oh, oh.
3990000	3991000	Your power went out too.
3991000	3993000	It's fucking freaky, right?
3993000	3994000	Power went out?
3994000	3995000	The power went out of your crib, right?
3995000	3996000	I don't think so.
3996000	3997000	I think Dan's...
3997000	3998000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
3998000	3999000	Jeez, okay.
3999000	4002000	There's a way to yell that and a way to not terrify everybody.
4002000	4005000	Speaking of which, I've been meaning to say,
4005000	4009000	I think that when we point out it's 9-11,
4009000	4013000	we should do it like it's the start of a musical.
4013000	4017000	Like, it's 9-11.
4017000	4019000	Like that.
4019000	4021000	Well, we shouldn't do it like that.
4021000	4024000	Because that legitimately scared me.
4024000	4027000	We thought it was 9-11 was happening.
4027000	4028000	I thought we got ISIS.
4028000	4033000	I want to circle back and admire their enthusiasm, you know?
4033000	4035000	Wherever it came from, that's a good thing.
4035000	4037000	That's what this country needs more of.
4038000	4041000	I got a flight coming up on 9-11, and I keep getting these reminders.
4041000	4042000	Hey, hey, hey.
4042000	4043000	Remember, you're...
4043000	4045000	Why would you do that?
4045000	4047000	Because I got a show on the 12th.
4047000	4049000	Well, show up on the 12th?
4049000	4051000	No, but it's in Ontario, Canada.
4051000	4052000	I can't fly data.
4052000	4057000	I've got to fly on 9-11 like a terrorist.
4057000	4060000	What's the deal with Jon Snow's thumb?
4060000	4063000	You know, it looks like a weird fucking toe.
4063000	4065000	Did no one else notice that?
4065000	4068000	He's trying to be sentimental and sexy, you know?
4068000	4072000	But it's like he has a giant fucking toe on his hand.
4072000	4073000	I've never noticed that.
4073000	4075000	What about his hairline, his weird-ass hairline?
4075000	4077000	I don't know about that.
4077000	4080000	I trust your judgment there, but I was looking right at his thumb.
4080000	4083000	His hairline looks like the Dow Jones...
4083000	4085000	You know, I got a problem with that last episode.
4085000	4088000	They never showed the fact that the wall just goes into a lake
4088000	4090000	and you could just say it around that.
4090000	4091000	Yeah, they just walked...
4091000	4094000	You could have just swung around on a rope.
4094000	4097000	Also, they could have just walked in knee-deep water.
4097000	4100000	They kept saying, oh, but the dead don't swim.
4100000	4101000	They don't have to swim.
4101000	4103000	They have to walk on the water.
4103000	4105000	The note of the wall goes just to the fucking water's edge
4105000	4109000	and you could just catch a ferry.
4109000	4111000	I mean, it's got to end somewhere, I guess.
4111000	4113000	I mean, do we think it went all the way around the world?
4113000	4115000	I just thought that they kind of...
4115000	4117000	I thought it was on the top of a high cliff or something
4117000	4118000	when it met the ocean.
4118000	4121000	I mean, my one beef was like, you know,
4121000	4123000	if something collapses like that,
4123000	4126000	there's not just going to be like this path.
4126000	4129000	They should have shown them crawling over rubble
4129000	4134000	and being like, goddamn, this is like a quarter of a wall.
4134000	4136000	That's kind of what happens when you collapse a wall
4136000	4138000	is you have about a quarter of a wall.
4138000	4140000	Yeah, that was convenient.
4140000	4144000	They cut it off halfway and then it went all the way down.
4144000	4148000	Also, that fucking ice dragon, that dead ice dragon,
4148000	4150000	they got holes all up on those wings.
4150000	4152000	How are you going to fly when you've got holes in your wings?
4153000	4157000	Where's the fucking aerodynamic integrity of the flight surface?
4157000	4159000	Well, it's flying with magic, isn't it?
4159000	4160000	Is it magic?
4160000	4163000	Well, I mean, probably a dragon at least
4163000	4165000	has some sort of magic flotation
4165000	4167000	because they're a heavy thing.
4167000	4170000	You know, you need a huge wing to put that along.
4170000	4172000	I think it's a combination of magic and like zombieism
4172000	4175000	because, you know, the white walker people,
4175000	4177000	you know, they don't got no muscles.
4177000	4179000	Like some of them got like a whole skeleton leg in there.
4179000	4180000	Yeah, some are missing a butt.
4180000	4183000	Like how are you going to walk around with no butt?
4183000	4187000	But if you can make a holy winged dragon fly
4187000	4189000	with your white walker magic,
4189000	4191000	then why don't you just make a skeleton fly?
4191000	4194000	Just make him like give him some of that dragon pie.
4194000	4196000	This is my favorite song from the movie Dumbo.
4196000	4198000	Yeah.
4198000	4201000	Yeah, they got the holes in the wings.
4201000	4203000	What was my other fucking beef with that shit?
4203000	4205000	There was some other sort of...
4205000	4207000	I just thought of that today.
4207000	4211000	The giant cultures had the giant chains
4211000	4213000	and they zombified the giants.
4213000	4215000	Yeah, but that was a lot of chain, man.
4215000	4217000	Yeah, they were a whole society thriving
4217000	4218000	above the wall.
4218000	4220000	But they had them in a cart
4220000	4222000	in the back of the goddamn fucking army?
4222000	4224000	Oh, yeah. They're always ready.
4224000	4226000	They brought all their stuff with them.
4226000	4228000	Okay, also, how about this?
4228000	4231000	Remember when they bring out the dead boogums
4231000	4233000	and they're bringing them out to show
4233000	4236000	Cersei and the whole gang that there's dead people.
4236000	4238000	And they chop the guy and he's still crawling
4238000	4240000	and kicking ass until they fucking dragon glass him.
4240000	4242000	But then the rest of the time they fight him
4242000	4244000	and they go chop and they just fucking go poof.
4244000	4249000	Now they live a lot longer when it's a story beat.
4249000	4252000	My concern with the Cersei plan was that
4252000	4255000	I thought she was going to look at the zombie
4255000	4258000	and go like, yeah, I have one for a butler.
4258000	4262000	I'm well aware you could make dead people hang out.
4262000	4264000	Yeah, I didn't think about that.
4264000	4268000	My chauffeur is a fucking mountain of zombie flesh.
4268000	4270000	My chauffeur!
4270000	4272000	Driving Miss Cersei?
4272000	4274000	There's your spin-off, HBO.
4274000	4277000	We should do a show where I'm a zombie.
4277000	4280000	And you're Dan Harmon.
4280000	4283000	But there's also a Scottish zombie dog.
4283000	4286000	What would a Scottish zombie dog sound like, Dan?
4286000	4288000	Scottish zombie dog?
4288000	4290000	Sigh.
4292000	4297000	Ooooooh.
4303000	4304000	Were you not done yet?
4304000	4305000	No.
4305000	4307000	Okay.
4307000	4309000	Zombies take their time.
4315000	4317000	Brains.
4318000	4320000	Wait, no.
4324000	4327000	Bow-wow-wains.
4329000	4331000	Would Scottish zombie dogs...
4331000	4332000	Let's not make it about Scottish...
4332000	4334000	Brains.
4334000	4336000	Earths.
4337000	4340000	Would they want cat brains or other dog brains?
4340000	4341000	Zombie, zombie dogs.
4341000	4343000	Cat brains.
4344000	4346000	Cat brains.
4346000	4348000	Do we have leave-y or leave-y still out of town?
4348000	4349000	He's gone.
4349000	4350000	Did he just leave us?
4350000	4352000	Yeah.
4352000	4353000	Get it.
4353000	4354000	Steve, leave us.
4354000	4356000	Yeah.
4356000	4357000	Where is everything?
4357000	4358000	What are you...
4358000	4360000	Well, we don't have a screen, so...
4360000	4361000	Yeah, where was the screen?
4361000	4362000	I thought we could have...
4362000	4363000	Jesus Christ.
4363000	4364000	This is a bad day.
4364000	4366000	I hope I do die.
4366000	4367000	I don't care.
4367000	4369000	The screen is up there.
4369000	4372000	Dan, you have so much to be thankful for and happy about.
4372000	4373000	I know.
4373000	4374000	I crashed from that.
4374000	4375000	You should have seen me on Wednesday.
4375000	4376000	It would have been a great podcast.
4376000	4378000	I've been grouchy all day because it's hot,
4378000	4379000	and I had dinner with church,
4379000	4381000	and I was being a pain in the butt,
4381000	4384000	and I was just being a grouchy asshole all day long.
4390000	4392000	I told you to stay in the van.
4393000	4395000	Remember when that awesome blind dude
4395000	4396000	joined us for our show,
4396000	4398000	and then the next week he was like,
4398000	4400000	Peace?
4400000	4403000	Because he just secretly didn't even like us.
4403000	4404000	Wait, what?
4404000	4405000	We found out he didn't like us?
4405000	4406000	Well, he didn't even come back.
4406000	4408000	Someone on Reddit saw that, like,
4408000	4411000	he has a short film made about his life.
4411000	4412000	Ooh la la.
4412000	4414000	Yeah.
4414000	4417000	You have a long film made about your life.
4417000	4419000	I had to make it myself.
4421000	4423000	And I still look shitty in it.
4423000	4424000	Can we go out...
4424000	4427000	We've talked kind of semi-seriously about going out
4427000	4429000	and doing another Harmon tour,
4429000	4432000	like maybe go to Europe or go somewhere fun
4432000	4435000	or maybe not film it, but just travel around a bunch
4435000	4436000	or maybe film it again?
4436000	4438000	Are you still up for that?
4438000	4440000	I can't be nailed down on that.
4440000	4443000	I mean, it sounds like when we did that last one,
4443000	4445000	you were kind of going through a little bit of a crisis
4445000	4447000	because you got fired off your show.
4447000	4449000	You seem like you're pretty down right now.
4449000	4451000	I think maybe it's time to go out there and hit the road.
4451000	4453000	I don't...
4453000	4457000	I want to do a tour and be happy.
4457000	4460000	I want to repeat the same process.
4461000	4464000	No, no, we go out and we find happiness by exploring,
4464000	4466000	by getting out of your comfort zone.
4466000	4468000	It didn't work that time.
4468000	4470000	Didn't it?
4470000	4471000	It didn't work?
4471000	4473000	I thought you were happy during that, I know.
4473000	4475000	I got faked a lot of that.
4475000	4477000	Yeah.
4477000	4478000	For the movie, right?
4478000	4480000	Yeah.
4480000	4483000	Because I knew they would sell eight copies.
4485000	4486000	Yeah, were we happy?
4486000	4487000	I can't tell.
4487000	4489000	We were trapped...
4489000	4490000	I avoided everybody.
4490000	4492000	I just kept leaving and going, doing my little disappearing act,
4492000	4494000	and I would go read a book and get away from everybody.
4494000	4496000	I'd probably work on the road with me.
4496000	4502000	I would like to do a tour again, but I want to be free to enjoy it.
4502000	4503000	Yeah.
4503000	4507000	But we can't fly to Europe and then get a tour bus, right?
4507000	4509000	You don't have to drive around Europe.
4509000	4511000	Yeah, bands never do that.
4511000	4513000	I don't know, man.
4513000	4514000	Yeah, that's what you do.
4514000	4516000	You fly to...
4516000	4519000	There's a lot of van travel in Britain.
4519000	4520000	Yeah, you know.
4520000	4522000	Marilyn Manson doesn't drive around in a van.
4522000	4524000	He's got a fucking sexy tour bus.
4524000	4525000	Okay.
4525000	4527000	I'm saying, here's the pitch.
4527000	4529000	We go out with Marilyn Manson.
4532000	4533000	That's a good idea.
4533000	4534000	Church and I hung out with that guy.
4534000	4535000	He's fucking... he's good fun.
4535000	4536000	He's a big dork.
4536000	4537000	We should get him on the show.
4537000	4538000	He's fucking... he's a good son.
4538000	4541000	He's welcome whenever he wants to come by.
4542000	4546000	Are you going to be all pouty about it when he does?
4546000	4549000	I don't know, because I don't care.
4549000	4550000	I know.
4550000	4552000	He'll come and then everybody will be like,
4552000	4553000	oh, I love Marilyn Manson.
4553000	4555000	I wish he would be on the show more often.
4555000	4556000	I'll be like, I get it.
4556000	4558000	You don't like me.
4558000	4562000	Stick it up your ass, you fucking herd of fucking...
4562000	4563000	Shh.
4572000	4573000	She turned to me around.
4573000	4574000	She got me.
4574000	4577000	Oh, we did it.
4577000	4579000	Who was that?
4579000	4580000	Yeah.
4580000	4582000	Whose laugh was that?
4582000	4586000	That laughter was unmistakable laughter.
4586000	4589000	I'm somebody who could not take my bad mood seriously.
4589000	4593000	She was just like laughing, like really entertained.
4593000	4596000	Like she was just felt... she felt a little sad for me.
4596000	4598000	But she was glad she wasn't me.
4599000	4601000	You know the movie I watched yesterday,
4601000	4604000	it does not hold up and I was pretty bummed out?
4604000	4605000	Spaceballs.
4605000	4606000	Spaceballs.
4606000	4607000	Spaceballs is not very good.
4607000	4609000	It's got a couple of jokes.
4609000	4612000	The Incredible or The Amazing Mr. Limbit with Don Knotts?
4612000	4614000	Oh, I saw that was on.
4614000	4615000	It's not that good, man.
4615000	4618000	I really wanted to remember that I loved that movie.
4618000	4619000	I've never seen it.
4619000	4621000	It never explained why he goes...
4621000	4624000	He turns into a fish, but also he has a super power
4624000	4626000	that he makes the loudest noise in the world.
4626000	4628000	Never explains.
4628000	4630000	He turns into a fish?
4630000	4632000	He turns into a fish, Spencer.
4632000	4635000	Don Knotts loves fish while his friend George Stickel
4635000	4638000	is trying to clearly fuck his wife.
4638000	4641000	And they all go out to Coney Island and he loves fish so much
4641000	4643000	and he looks down at the fish and he goes,
4643000	4645000	I wish I were a fish and he falls into the water
4645000	4647000	and he turns into a fish.
4647000	4649000	But he's also a fish that wears glasses
4649000	4651000	so we remember it's Don Knotts.
4651000	4654000	And we can tell him apart from the no other animated fish,
4654000	4657000	except for a weird lady fish, he almost fucks a fish
4657000	4660000	in the fucking beginning of the second act.
4660000	4663000	He takes to that pretty quickly.
4663000	4666000	Then he makes a weird sound.
4666000	4671000	Then he kills all the Nazis and we win World War II.
4671000	4675000	Well, how could that possibly be bad?
4675000	4677000	My childhood I thought it was awesome,
4677000	4679000	but there's a lot of holes.
4679000	4681000	There's a lot of holes in Mr. Limbit.
4681000	4683000	Oh, boy.
4683000	4687000	But the admiral in that movie is the neighbor from Mr. Ed,
4687000	4689000	so that made me happy.
4689000	4691000	Mr. Ed's fucking great.
4691000	4694000	Spencer, you've told us that you've leveled our characters up
4694000	4696000	because we've achieved such greatness
4696000	4698000	that we are now level three characters?
4698000	4700000	You've achieved such greatness, yeah,
4700000	4702000	that you're now level three characters.
4702000	4704000	Yeah!
4704000	4706000	Ooh!
4706000	4708000	We fucking heard it by lighting doors on fire
4708000	4710000	and running away from shit.
4710000	4713000	Not for me as it is for you.
4713000	4715000	Meaning what exactly?
4715000	4717000	It's more fun.
4717000	4719000	Does that mean that I...
4719000	4721000	Are my loadouts updated?
4721000	4722000	Oh, yeah.
4722000	4725000	If they're the ones on the right, yeah.
4725000	4728000	I mean, yes.
4728000	4729000	All right.
4729000	4730000	But we're still on the same loadout
4730000	4731000	that we were on the last time
4731000	4732000	as we haven't gone to sleep yet.
4732000	4734000	Because you haven't gone to sleep yet.
4734000	4735000	Okay.
4735000	4737000	I need a real refresher on this D&D.
4737000	4739000	You guys ready for some D&D right now?
4739000	4741000	No.
4741000	4745000	Are we gonna do this without a diarrhea, Jr.?
4745000	4748000	I got it all figured out.
4748000	4749000	Okay.
4749000	4751000	Which is why I got John Carmen.
4751000	4755000	It doesn't make any sense, but Steve will hate that.
4755000	4756000	Who's John Carmen?
4756000	4758000	Thank you for bearing with me.
4758000	4760000	John Carmen is a Steve Levy-looking person
4760000	4763000	that used to be Justin Rowland's assistant.
4763000	4765000	Is he here with us in person tonight?
4765000	4767000	No.
4767000	4769000	It's not for anybody here.
4769000	4770000	It's for Steve Levy.
4770000	4772000	He's gonna get a kick out of that,
4772000	4773000	and I'll be satisfied.
4773000	4775000	Okay.
4775000	4777000	And we will have burned a minute or two.
4777000	4779000	What about our new intern, Sammy?
4779000	4780000	Did you see her?
4780000	4783000	She kind of had, like, a Levy kind of vibe.
4783000	4785000	Oh, she's gonna be running this place, too.
4785000	4786000	I'll do it.
4786000	4787000	Thank you.
4787000	4788000	Was that Sammy that said that?
4788000	4789000	No.
4789000	4790000	Oh, no.
4790000	4795000	You can't do it.
4795000	4796000	All right.
4796000	4798000	You want to give us a recap, Spencer?
4798000	4799000	Yeah.
4799000	4800000	Please, please.
4800000	4802000	We had shrub, and things went kind of weird,
4802000	4803000	and I don't quite...
4803000	4805000	All I remember is that trousers were pulled down
4805000	4807000	at the very end, and that was our cliffhanger.
4807000	4810000	So, Spencer, if you will, the recap of last week's
4810000	4811000	Harventown.
4811000	4812000	It's like the one thing I don't do.
4812000	4815000	Last time on Harventown!
4815000	4817000	Our heroes were...
4817000	4821000	They had just defeated or gotten away from the evil cult
4821000	4824000	right as it collapsed, like the whole church collapsed.
4824000	4825000	Oh, boy.
4825000	4827000	It was a disaster.
4827000	4830000	The vampire escaped in the form of a mist,
4830000	4833000	leaving our heroes high and dry in the Priory,
4833000	4836000	where they searched for survivors.
4836000	4839000	There, they became attacked by two little girls
4839000	4843000	who knocked Diarrhea Jr. unconscious.
4843000	4847000	Chad leapt into action, grabbing one of the girls,
4847000	4849000	and Carlos leapt into action,
4849000	4852000	smashing one of the little girls in the face.
4852000	4855000	After some conversation, Patchens came back,
4855000	4856000	and he needed help.
4856000	4858000	So he took you to the Fell's house,
4858000	4861000	where the Pryor was burning down the house
4861000	4863000	and trying to murder the family,
4863000	4865000	but you stopped him.
4865000	4868000	Now you're outside of the burning-down house
4868000	4869000	with the Pryor.
4869000	4872000	He's tied up, and you don't know what's going on.
4872000	4875000	It's been a long night.
4875000	4877000	The end.
4877000	4879000	All right.
4879000	4881000	Wait, did you say we're...
4885000	4887000	The most important part was the Pryor.
4887000	4889000	You said we're still outside the Fell's house
4889000	4890000	with the Pryor?
4890000	4891000	Yeah.
4891000	4892000	Where we left off?
4892000	4893000	Yeah, he's unconscious.
4893000	4894000	He's, I think, tied up.
4894000	4895000	Okay.
4895000	4897000	Well, and how about the Fell's?
4897000	4898000	How are they holding up?
4898000	4900000	They're okay.
4900000	4903000	Tom just had given you a bunch of church relics
4903000	4905000	that he had stolen.
4905000	4907000	But they weren't of much value, right?
4907000	4911000	Well, you don't know that, because you're not shopable.
4911000	4912000	Well, let's...
4912000	4914000	I'll secure these relics.
4914000	4915000	I'll take these.
4915000	4918000	Are they enough to, like, small enough to fit in my sack?
4918000	4921000	Yeah, they're small enough to fit in your sack.
4921000	4924000	I say to the Fell's,
4924000	4926000	Tom...
4927000	4928000	Maggie?
4928000	4929000	Bonnie.
4929000	4930000	Bonnie.
4932000	4934000	Little Fell?
4934000	4935000	Sorry about your home.
4935000	4936000	Good luck.
4936000	4939000	We may be back to help you out,
4939000	4941000	but I think the best thing we can do for you
4941000	4943000	is get our colleague away from your little boy
4943000	4944000	while he's still unconscious,
4944000	4947000	because he's mixed up and he thinks your kid is possessed.
4947000	4949000	Well, we can handle him.
4949000	4951000	Well, don't handle him.
4951000	4953000	Well...
4953000	4957000	He's only mad because there's been so many shenanigans.
4957000	4960000	We just, you know, attempted murder.
4960000	4962000	House just got burned down.
4962000	4965000	But he was doing it because his church was under attack.
4965000	4970000	Believe me, the people that are responsible for your woes mostly,
4970000	4973000	if they were here, they wouldn't be tied up
4973000	4975000	and they wouldn't be having this conversation.
4975000	4978000	That was self-defense. He feared for his life.
4978000	4980000	Well, okay. Touchy.
4980000	4982000	I'm not saying he did a good thing.
4982000	4985000	I'm not saying, like, he doesn't deserve retribution.
4985000	4987000	I'm just saying, like, when he wakes up,
4987000	4989000	I'd like him to be at the church,
4989000	4992000	because I still want to talk to him about stuff,
4992000	4993000	and I don't want him to kill your kid,
4993000	4994000	and I don't want you to kill him before that.
4994000	4997000	Hey, Carlos, do you think there's a chance that maybe he's pissed off
4997000	5002000	because Tom just admitted that he stole all of these relics from the church?
5002000	5005000	Maybe he's mad about what these relics mean to the church.
5005000	5009000	Yeah, why would I be mad about the fact someone's trying to murder my family
5009000	5011000	and burn down my house? That doesn't make any sense.
5011000	5013000	Why did you steal these relics in the first place?
5013000	5016000	Because we're poor. I haven't been producing stuff with my farm.
5016000	5018000	The church is supposed to help. They don't do shit.
5018000	5020000	Who are you going to be selling these relics to?
5020000	5022000	Where's the market for his church relics?
5022000	5024000	Well, there was a merchant who was coming by,
5024000	5026000	but that plot threat didn't get explored.
5032000	5033000	Tom...
5033000	5035000	He should have been here weeks ago.
5035000	5039000	Like I said at the top, Tom, we're going to take the prior away,
5039000	5042000	take him to the church, so when he wakes up,
5042000	5046000	your kid can be safe, and we'll send whatever help we can.
5046000	5051000	And then he'll just go back to terrorizing the town and, you know, being a dick?
5052000	5055000	No, he won't. He's going to be in big trouble.
5055000	5060000	He lost his whole church. Believe me, he's going to be the Tom Fel of priors.
5060000	5061000	Great.
5061000	5065000	I examined the priors' body and clothes to see if he's holding anything
5065000	5068000	that might be of value or interest or...
5068000	5073000	He has the holy symbol of the church, just like a lot of the clerics have.
5073000	5076000	He doesn't have any ID or any money on him.
5076000	5079000	He's not really wearing very much clothes.
5079000	5081000	He's kind of like hastily dressed.
5081000	5084000	It's not like, you know, his formal attire in any sense.
5084000	5088000	So it's kind of like he just came out at night with a sword.
5088000	5091000	You got a wheelbarrow or something, Tom?
5091000	5093000	Yeah, sure.
5093000	5098000	Let's put the prior in a wheelbarrow and cart him back to the church.
5098000	5101000	Yeah, take those relics, take the prior back.
5101000	5102000	We'll do a debrief.
5102000	5104000	Yeah, how about that?
5104000	5106000	I guess we'll follow you.
5106000	5108000	The Fel family said that?
5108000	5111000	No, you guys got a house to reconstruct.
5111000	5116000	Why would you want to follow us if the guy wants to kill your kid?
5116000	5120000	You know, the church, it shelters people in need, theoretically.
5120000	5122000	Yeah, let's all go along.
5122000	5125000	Okay, cool. Okay.
5125000	5126000	Makes sense.
5126000	5129000	Fair enough, Tom.
5129000	5131000	All right.
5131000	5134000	I take some water out of my little water skin thing
5134000	5137000	and I splash it on the priors' face and I wake him up.
5137000	5140000	Maybe we should talk to this guy, right, and see if he's cooled out a little bit now?
5140000	5143000	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
5143000	5146000	All right, you wake him up.
5146000	5148000	What?
5148000	5151000	Hey, we got a job to do.
5151000	5153000	There's evil afoot.
5153000	5154000	What's the job?
5154000	5157000	What's your first item on your to-do list?
5157000	5160000	Kill the unclean.
5160000	5163000	Right, but the unclean of, like, they left.
5163000	5166000	No, they're right here, among us.
5166000	5169000	The Fel family, they're just dirty, grubby people.
5169000	5171000	They're not the real problem.
5171000	5174000	Your church was infiltrated by horrible evil.
5174000	5177000	I don't know what you're talking about, and you're dumb.
5177000	5180000	Do you think the whole family's unclean or just...
5180000	5183000	Yeah, they're protecting a fucking demon child.
5183000	5185000	But we released that demon.
5185000	5187000	The demon was expelled.
5187000	5190000	That sounds like lies that a demon might say.
5190000	5192000	So now the demon's in us?
5192000	5193000	I don't know.
5193000	5195000	This guy's just a fucking Looney Tunes, right?
5195000	5196000	I don't know what to believe.
5196000	5198000	You're just saying that you got rid of a demon
5198000	5201000	when I could see it clearly inside this child?
5201000	5202000	You can see it.
5202000	5203000	Yeah, he's evil.
5203000	5204000	Look at him.
5204000	5206000	He's a piece of shit.
5206000	5209000	Well, if you're such a hotshot cleric, are you a cleric?
5209000	5211000	No, not by trade.
5211000	5213000	But you're a holy man.
5213000	5214000	Yes.
5214000	5216000	Show us something.
5216000	5219000	What would you suggest doing to get this demon out of this child?
5219000	5221000	I think the sword's in the house.
5221000	5223000	You want to kill the child?
5223000	5224000	Yeah.
5224000	5226000	That's what the Church of the Silver Flame does.
5226000	5228000	We purge evil.
5228000	5229000	By killing children?
5229000	5232000	You don't, you know, bathe it into cleanliness,
5232000	5234000	like into goodness.
5234000	5235000	You kill it.
5235000	5236000	You burn it.
5236000	5238000	You're just choosing to not believe us
5238000	5240000	when we tell you that we've already dealt with this situation
5240000	5241000	when you weren't here.
5241000	5243000	You're saying that you're confused,
5243000	5246000	but at the same time you're saying that you know exactly what's going on.
5246000	5247000	Right.
5247000	5249000	You're outsiders who came snooping into our business.
5249000	5251000	You don't know our ways or what's going on.
5251000	5252000	You don't know the score.
5252000	5254000	I'm saying that there's evil afoot.
5254000	5255000	I see it.
5255000	5257000	I guarantee you one thing.
5257000	5259000	We didn't cause your problems here in this town.
5259000	5261000	You were on a track to destruction.
5261000	5263000	You had vampires in your basement.
5263000	5266000	The Fells had a demon that we released.
5266000	5268000	You are late to the ballgame,
5268000	5270000	and you're hogging all the hot dogs.
5274000	5276000	I high-five Carlos for that.
5276000	5283000	By the church bylaws, I am invoking emergency mutiny.
5283000	5286000	Rule number three, subsection seven,
5286000	5295000	if the prior of a church is demonstrating an inability to serve his office,
5295000	5298000	he will be bound and put in a wheelbarrow,
5298000	5303000	and the next highest-ranking church official in the vicinity
5303000	5305000	will take over his duties until further notice.
5305000	5307000	It's called the 25th Amendment.
5307000	5308000	Oh.
5308000	5310000	Well, who's the next-ranking church official?
5310000	5312000	That would be me.
5312000	5313000	Oh.
5313000	5314000	Well, show me.
5314000	5316000	How do we know that's true?
5316000	5318000	Well, I mean...
5318000	5320000	All that bylaws sounded improvised.
5320000	5321000	Yeah.
5323000	5324000	Hey, a prior.
5324000	5328000	Do you know a church member of your congregation named Arden?
5328000	5329000	Yeah.
5329000	5331000	Do you know that she's a vampire mist right now?
5331000	5332000	What?
5332000	5333000	Yeah.
5333000	5335000	She's a vampire that was doing crazy blood magic
5335000	5337000	down in your basement in the sanctuary,
5337000	5339000	and we went down there and kicked a bunch of ass,
5339000	5342000	but she weanied out by turning into a mist
5342000	5344000	like a piece of vampire shit,
5344000	5346000	and she boned out, and now we're looking for her.
5346000	5349000	So you've been harboring vampire mist ladies the whole time,
5349000	5351000	and what's her deal?
5351000	5353000	That's some fucking conspiracy bullshit.
5353000	5356000	Vampires and demons have nothing to do with each other.
5356000	5358000	Why would there be a demon-possessed child
5358000	5360000	if there was vampires in the church?
5360000	5362000	That's what we're trying to find out.
5362000	5363000	Oh, okay.
5363000	5366000	All we know is you run a bad church, brother.
5366000	5368000	Like, you ain't on your shit.
5368000	5370000	You called me dumb. You're dumb.
5370000	5373000	You guys are peeing in barrels and keeping it.
5373000	5374000	Yeah.
5374000	5375000	Yeah, we found your pee barrels.
5375000	5377000	We found your pee barrels.
5377000	5378000	Guess what?
5378000	5379000	Vampires are throwing them at people,
5379000	5382000	like our friend diarrhea got covered in pee.
5382000	5384000	That stuff's important.
5384000	5385000	Why do you keep the pee?
5385000	5386000	It's for laundry.
5386000	5388000	You wash your clothes in pee?
5388000	5390000	Well, kind of, yeah.
5390000	5393000	So how do you know when you pee your pants?
5393000	5394000	What happens when you pee your pants?
5394000	5395000	You go, great.
5395000	5398000	Now, I don't know if you're too laundry?
5398000	5399000	It's not that simple.
5399000	5400000	It's a process.
5400000	5402000	It's a multi-step process.
5402000	5403000	I'll show you how to do it.
5403000	5407000	You can accept that much nuance in pissed clothes,
5407000	5409000	but you can't accept that maybe we know what we're talking about
5409000	5411000	a little bit with the demon shine.
5411000	5413000	I'm starting to accept that that may be the case,
5413000	5415000	but I'm still confused about this whole vampire theme thing.
5415000	5416000	Do you know that the sanctuary was
5416000	5418000	exploded by a giant explosion,
5418000	5420000	and the whole thing is rubble now?
5420000	5421000	What?
5421000	5423000	I'm wheeling you back to your church.
5423000	5424000	Yeah, that's what's happening.
5424000	5426000	Come on, fella family.
5426000	5427000	We all go back to the church.
5427000	5428000	All right, yeah.
5428000	5429000	No, you had been.
5429000	5431000	You're there at the church.
5431000	5432000	What do you do?
5432000	5434000	Patience is there.
5434000	5437000	Also, he was with you the whole time.
5437000	5441000	I'm going to keep wheeling the prior to the hatch
5441000	5447000	where the sight of egress from the room.
5447000	5450000	Okay, you can't get there with the wheelbarrow
5450000	5452000	because it's like a ruined wreck,
5452000	5454000	like it's a pile of blocks.
5454000	5456000	It became a quarter of a wall.
5456000	5459000	You can get to that area,
5459000	5461000	but not like you have to climb and clamber.
5461000	5462000	I'm going to stand the prior up.
5462000	5464000	Let's undo his feet, but not his hands
5464000	5467000	and walk him over the rubble through sight.
5467000	5468000	You do that.
5468000	5470000	You understand why I have your hands bound still, sir?
5470000	5472000	Yeah.
5472000	5473000	You do?
5473000	5474000	No.
5475000	5477000	You're threatening the life of an innocent child.
5477000	5478000	Right.
5478000	5482000	I'm not doing it because I think that you're a bad person.
5482000	5484000	I'm trying to protect the innocent.
5484000	5488000	Well, keep an eye on that kid.
5488000	5489000	Everyone keeps an eye on kids.
5489000	5491000	By default, they're adorable.
5491000	5492000	Okay.
5492000	5495000	Here we go again.
5495000	5500000	Fucking all going to jail.
5500000	5502000	I don't know how I got this reputation.
5502000	5505000	You keep talking about beautiful, sexy children
5505000	5508000	and wanting to smash them.
5508000	5509000	All right.
5509000	5510000	So where are you headed?
5510000	5511000	To the hatch?
5511000	5512000	Yeah.
5512000	5513000	All right.
5513000	5514000	You do that.
5514000	5515000	You open the secret door and he's like,
5515000	5517000	yeah, this is the piss basement.
5517000	5518000	Yeah.
5518000	5519000	You know about this place.
5519000	5520000	Yeah, go down there.
5520000	5521000	Okay.
5521000	5523000	My hands are tied.
5523000	5527000	Well, I'll drop you down.
5527000	5529000	That sounds painful.
5529000	5531000	You go down first.
5531000	5534000	I'll kind of hand him down to you down the ladder.
5534000	5535000	All right.
5535000	5538000	If we undo your hands, are you going to be a bad person?
5538000	5539000	No.
5539000	5541000	Are you lying?
5541000	5542000	No.
5542000	5543000	I'm telling you.
5543000	5545000	I sense bad question.
5545000	5546000	Sir.
5546000	5547000	It's a bad question.
5547000	5551000	If I untie your hands and you try to harm
5551000	5555000	any of the fellow family, I'm telling you right now,
5555000	5561000	I have no choice but to intercede like with extreme prejudice.
5561000	5563000	Okay.
5563000	5564000	Okay.
5564000	5571000	How extreme.
5571000	5573000	I undo his hands.
5573000	5575000	All right.
5575000	5578000	He like, you know, if he feels his wrists
5578000	5580000	and then he slaps you.
5580000	5581000	Slaps me?
5581000	5582000	Yeah.
5582000	5583000	I take it.
5583000	5584000	Yeah.
5585000	5588000	That's what, like, that's what he didn't want to happen.
5588000	5589000	Like he was trying to bait you.
5589000	5590000	Right.
5590000	5591000	Yeah.
5591000	5592000	I say, see?
5592000	5593000	Yeah.
5593000	5594000	Yeah.
5594000	5595000	Yeah.
5595000	5597000	I can take a slap, can't I?
5597000	5604000	I go up and I slap Carlos just to prove that point.
5604000	5605000	He's really confused.
5605000	5607000	He's like, what the fuck?
5607000	5608000	Yeah.
5608000	5610000	I like getting slapped.
5610000	5613000	Brings me closer to the silver flame.
5613000	5616000	I give him like a Steve McQueen, like Ali McGrath slap in the getaway.
5616000	5618000	The forehand, backhand, forehand one.
5618000	5619000	Who you hit?
5619000	5620000	Carlos.
5620000	5622000	I'm just showing how much he likes to get slapped.
5622000	5623000	I'm showing those guys.
5623000	5624000	He's like the Hulk.
5624000	5627000	Like the more you slap him, the more he focuses his rage.
5627000	5628000	All right.
5628000	5630000	He's growing unnerved.
5630000	5631000	Okay.
5631000	5632000	All right.
5632000	5635000	Now climb down that ladder and check out your piss basement.
5635000	5636000	All right.
5636000	5638000	He climbs down there.
5638000	5640000	It's all just collapse.
5640000	5643000	There's like, you know, yeah.
5643000	5646000	Well, it's not like a fucking God eraser.
5646000	5649000	I like, like, like, like, so some shit collapsed.
5649000	5653000	There's still evidence of horrific demonic bullshit.
5653000	5657000	Can we still see the blood all over the table and the altar kind of thing?
5657000	5658000	Yeah.
5658000	5659000	Well, not so much.
5659000	5660000	All that stuff has collapsed.
5660000	5661000	The sanctuary's fallen.
5661000	5665000	Are there the corpses of those, uh, of those blood boogums?
5665000	5669000	You can see bits of corpses, like a couple limbs, like coming out of the wreckage
5669000	5670000	and stuff.
5670000	5671000	Yeah.
5671000	5675000	I walk over and I, uh, and I take one of the like, like body parts of a clearly
5675000	5678000	mutated thing and show this to the prior.
5678000	5679000	All right.
5679000	5681000	It just like, it just like sluffs off of the body.
5681000	5683000	Like it's not really heavily attached.
5683000	5684000	And I go, look at this.
5684000	5685000	Is this normal to you?
5685000	5688000	Is this a regular church basement, pee basement kind of activities?
5688000	5691000	No.
5691000	5694000	You feel, you, you probably feel pretty stupid now telling us that we don't
5694000	5695000	know what we're talking about.
5695000	5696000	Yes.
5696000	5697000	Yeah.
5697000	5701000	I take that book that says how to do what to do when your church is under
5701000	5702000	attack.
5702000	5703000	All right.
5703000	5704000	I said, did you even read this?
5704000	5705000	Yeah.
5705000	5706000	Did you?
5706000	5707000	Yeah, I did.
5707000	5708000	Oh shit.
5708000	5709000	I don't think you did though, but you could lie.
5709000	5710000	That's fine.
5710000	5711000	That's me.
5711000	5715920	The GM saying when I opened it, the binding cracks like fucking thunder.
5715920	5717000	That's a fucking lie.
5717000	5718000	Okay.
5718000	5719000	You're right.
5719000	5720000	It is.
5720000	5721000	Okay.
5721000	5723000	Why would you do that?
5723000	5724000	Why would I lie?
5724000	5725000	Yeah.
5725000	5726000	I don't know.
5726000	5728000	I just walked up that you read this book and then let your church be under
5728000	5729000	attack.
5729000	5730000	I was trying to help.
5730000	5731000	Yeah.
5731000	5732000	That's fine.
5732000	5733000	And failure's fine too.
5733000	5736000	But then when you find out you failed, you don't take it out on neighbor
5736000	5737000	kids.
5737000	5738000	That's probably true.
5738000	5739000	Prior.
5739000	5741000	Do you know, by the way, where did we leave stiff and weighing the little
5741000	5742000	girls?
5742000	5743000	Are they still with us?
5743000	5745000	They're, yeah, they were with you too.
5745000	5746000	So they're here too.
5746000	5747000	Okay.
5747000	5748000	Prior.
5748000	5749000	Do you know these little children?
5749000	5750000	Yeah.
5750000	5751000	Yeah.
5751000	5752000	Uh, do you know where they came from?
5752000	5754000	Because they don't seem to have any memory of their families or their, you
5754000	5755000	know, their whereabouts.
5755000	5757000	They were found on the church doorstep.
5757000	5759000	And do you know Arden?
5759000	5760000	Yeah.
5760000	5761000	Do you know where we could find?
5761000	5762000	Like, where does she live?
5762000	5763000	Where's she from?
5763000	5764000	Well, she stayed at the church.
5764000	5766000	We don't know where she's from.
5766000	5767000	Convenient.
5767000	5768000	She was from the church.
5768000	5769000	You know, like you guys.
5769000	5772000	Where do you think all your church people are?
5772000	5774000	Uh, dead.
5774000	5777000	What do you think they're under rubble?
5777000	5778000	Yeah.
5778000	5779000	Well, okay.
5779000	5780000	So.
5780000	5781000	Okay.
5781000	5782000	Yeah.
5783000	5784000	Okay.
5784000	5785000	Yeah.
5785000	5786000	I'm kind of talking about circles here.
5786000	5787000	All right.
5787000	5788000	All right.
5788000	5789000	So we've reached a point of agreement here.
5789000	5792000	You agree that your church got infiltrated by, uh, Boogens.
5792000	5793000	Yeah.
5793000	5795000	It's confusing.
5795000	5797000	We need to find Arden.
5797000	5799000	Shit.
5799000	5802000	Well, what do you, what should I do?
5802000	5803000	Tell us about her.
5803000	5804000	Hmm.
5804000	5811000	She liked the church and she liked talking to people and she liked prayer.
5811000	5813000	She likes fire.
5813000	5815000	Ooh.
5816000	5818000	That's normal for the church.
5818000	5819000	Right.
5819000	5820000	She never said where she was from?
5820000	5821000	No.
5821000	5822000	We never really asked.
5822000	5824000	We're not very social.
5827000	5833000	Why are people in your church turning into vampires and doing cow blood magic and in a pee room?
5833000	5834000	I don't know.
5834000	5839000	It's possible, I suppose, that she was a vampire before she came to our church.
5840000	5843000	I think we need to notify the higher ups.
5843000	5844000	Yeah.
5844000	5845000	No.
5845000	5848500	I mean, why didn't you get sent here on some sort of mission that would then involve you
5848500	5851000	like reporting back to the people that sent you on a mission?
5851000	5852000	Yeah.
5852000	5853000	Yeah.
5853000	5855000	I was kind of putting it off.
5855000	5859000	I think, I think we need to fill them in.
5859000	5860000	Yeah.
5860000	5861000	Yeah.
5861000	5862000	How do we got a table talk?
5862000	5866000	How do we go about reconnecting with our higher ups?
5866000	5870000	Well, you could like send them a letter or you could let go in person.
5870000	5881000	I say we take the prior and patrons and go back with these relics and some evidence of
5881000	5885000	what we've done and touch base back home.
5885000	5886000	Yeah.
5886000	5888000	That sounds like a good idea.
5888000	5889000	Yeah.
5889000	5891000	We still got our wagon with those horses.
5891000	5893000	This has been like a day, two days.
5893000	5895000	How long have you been here in this town?
5895000	5896000	I think two days.
5896000	5897000	Yeah.
5897000	5902000	Our horses aren't dead because we were just kind of left them in like behind that barn.
5902000	5903000	Right.
5903000	5904000	The barn.
5904000	5905000	Yeah.
5905000	5906000	The barn wasn't attached to the fill house.
5906000	5907000	It was just nearby.
5907000	5908000	Okay.
5908000	5909000	It's probably not.
5909000	5910000	All right.
5910000	5911000	We take the prior.
5911000	5913000	We take passions and we head back to the church to touch base.
5913000	5915000	Should we take Stiff and Wang?
5915000	5919000	I mean, I know what your answer is going to be.
5919000	5921000	They're orphans.
5921000	5922000	Okay.
5922000	5923000	We take the children too.
5923000	5924000	We take Stiff and Wang.
5924000	5925000	We take the children.
5925000	5926000	Yeah.
5926000	5927000	Yeah.
5927000	5928000	The priors got a lot of cleaning up to do.
5928000	5929000	What are you going to take?
5929000	5930000	We're taking him.
5930000	5931000	Yeah.
5931000	5932000	The fells have a lot of cleaning up to do.
5932000	5933000	We'll leave them be.
5933000	5934000	They'll be safe now.
5934000	5935000	Should we take passions?
5935000	5939000	Should we leave passions to clean up or should we take passions with us?
5939000	5940000	Okay.
5940000	5941000	Pations and the prior.
5941000	5942000	Stiff, Wang.
5942000	5943000	Stiff, Wang.
5943000	5944000	Let's everybody get them.
5944000	5945000	No fells.
5945000	5946000	No fells.
5946000	5947000	All right.
5947000	5951000	Take any material you need from the church in the reparation of your home.
5951000	5955400	We think we're going to make it into a community center.
5955400	5956400	Not a reference.
5956400	5959760	Just like, you know, the building.
5959760	5960760	That's interesting.
5960760	5963280	A secular kind of approach.
5963280	5965320	Obviously religion has failed this community.
5965320	5966320	Right.
5966320	5969360	Perhaps civic mindedness can take its place.
5969360	5970360	Perhaps.
5970360	5971360	I like your style, Tom.
5971360	5972360	Perhaps.
5972360	5973360	Yeah, man.
5973360	5977160	I think the next time I see you, you're going to be called Tom Rose.
5978160	5984160	Not because you're Jewish, but like Rose, like you rose up.
5984160	5985160	Right.
5985160	5986160	Right.
5986160	5987160	All right.
5987160	5988160	Away.
5988160	5991160	Back to our church elders.
5991160	5993160	All right.
5993160	5997160	We're so bad at this.
5997160	5998160	So you're standing.
5998160	6000160	I can't believe we leveled up in the last room.
6000160	6003160	All we did was yell a lot and pull a guy's pants down.
6003160	6006800	I think if you're level one and you hit a little girl in the face, you just jump to
6006800	6007800	level two.
6007800	6008800	I think that's it.
6008800	6010400	We started at level two.
6010400	6011400	He gave us level two.
6011400	6012400	Now we're level three.
6012400	6013400	All right.
6013400	6014400	Well, yeah.
6014400	6015400	Pretty hard.
6015400	6016400	Yeah.
6016400	6018760	So you're still in the church.
6018760	6019760	You're still in the church.
6019760	6021800	And what do you call it?
6021800	6022800	Diarrhea Jr.
6022800	6023800	He looks bad.
6023800	6025000	He looks not good.
6025000	6026000	He's like sweaty.
6026000	6027000	Oh, boy.
6027000	6028800	He looks really sick.
6028800	6029800	Uh-oh.
6029800	6030800	He falls down.
6030800	6031800	All right.
6031800	6032800	I...
6032800	6033800	Shit.
6033800	6034800	Okay.
6035800	6036800	I'm gonna...
6036800	6037800	Shit.
6037800	6038800	Well, I don't...
6038800	6039800	I still have the same old spells.
6039800	6040800	I can't detect.
6040800	6041800	Right.
6041800	6042800	Yeah.
6042800	6043800	Do you want to...
6043800	6044800	Hey.
6044800	6045800	Prior.
6045800	6046800	You said you had eyes that can see this shit.
6046800	6053520	Is he succumbing to the pneumonia or did Arden the mist vampire go into him?
6053520	6060560	I think that and other things.
6060560	6064000	I think he might have a demon in him.
6064000	6066080	He also looks like he has mummy rot.
6066080	6068920	DJ's got mummy rot?
6068920	6071200	And a demon and vampire mist.
6071200	6073200	Oh, no.
6073200	6074200	Jesus.
6074200	6075200	That's my prognosis.
6075200	6080320	Do you have any spells, Carlos, to help us out or to check them out?
6080320	6081320	No.
6081320	6089440	I mean, I would be using the offensive loadout from when I was level two and all I have left
6089440	6090440	is...
6091440	6096440	I use, like, perception on him to see, like, what's going on with him.
6096440	6097440	11.
6097440	6099440	Oh, man.
6099440	6105920	You can see that, like, his skin is pale in a trackable pattern and it seems to, like,
6105920	6107400	go underneath his clothes.
6107400	6108400	Fuck.
6108400	6113440	Like, it's, like, a gradient, you know, like he's getting progressively more pale underneath
6113440	6114440	his clothes.
6114440	6115440	All right.
6115440	6116440	Let's get his clothes off.
6116440	6117440	Like, just...
6117440	6118440	We can attend to this.
6118440	6119440	This is an emergency.
6120440	6121440	You see the...
6121440	6126440	You rip off his shirt and you see on his chest there's, like, a keyhole and it's, like, the
6126440	6127440	source of all this paleness.
6127440	6128440	It's, like...
6128440	6130440	Oh, the hole above his heart.
6130440	6131440	Yeah.
6131440	6133440	Oh, I remember something about this.
6133440	6134440	It happened.
6134440	6137440	From our backstory.
6137440	6138440	I look...
6138440	6141440	Is one of those relics I took a key?
6141440	6142440	No.
6142440	6143440	Shit.
6144440	6147440	So, he's got...
6147440	6150440	He's slowly dying or slowly being taken over by something.
6150440	6151440	Okay?
6151440	6152440	Yeah.
6152440	6153440	Right?
6153440	6154440	Well, who are you asking?
6154440	6155440	You, Spencer.
6155440	6156440	No, I'm not telling you anything.
6156440	6159440	Oh, I'm using my perception of watching what's happening here.
6159440	6160440	Okay.
6160440	6161440	Is my knowledge of...
6161440	6162440	He just seems sick.
6162440	6165440	I have knowledge, you know, Arcana.
6165440	6168440	I got it.
6169440	6173440	He seems like he has got some sort of crazy magical, like, some sort of curse-related
6173440	6175440	magic, like, bad juju magic.
6175440	6177440	We got to get him back to the church, then, probably.
6177440	6178440	Right?
6178440	6179440	Right.
6179440	6181440	This isn't, like, something that happened to him.
6181440	6183440	This is something that's part of his...
6183440	6184440	I remember...
6184440	6185440	I have a past with him.
6185440	6187440	I remember something about this keyhole on his chest.
6187440	6190440	You don't remember very much about it, but yes.
6190440	6195440	But the reason why he's unconscious is he got knocked out by one of the girls, right?
6195440	6196440	Well, he came back.
6196440	6198440	He got re-conscious after.
6198440	6199440	Oh, so he's been conscious.
6199440	6201440	Now he's just starting to look sick.
6201440	6202440	Yeah.
6202440	6203440	All right.
6203440	6204440	Let's get to the wagon and just get him back.
6204440	6205440	Let's get him home, yeah.
6205440	6206440	Can you do anything for him?
6206440	6207440	Absolutely.
6207440	6208440	All right.
6208440	6209440	And we're all coming, right?
6209440	6210440	We should maybe get a bigger wagon.
6210440	6211440	Yeah, yeah.
6214440	6216440	Do you have another wagon here, Pryor?
6216440	6217440	I'll find one.
6217440	6218440	Okay, great.
6219440	6227440	Or, stiff and wang, it could be adopted by the fells, and then we don't need a bigger wagon.
6228440	6231440	I mean, that's going to be a lot of paperwork.
6235440	6238440	Okay, we take the wagon by the fell's house and say,
6238440	6240440	hey, do you guys want to take care of these little girls?
6240440	6242440	The fells aren't there.
6242440	6243440	Wait, where are they?
6243440	6244440	At the church.
6244440	6245440	They're with us.
6245440	6246440	Yep.
6246440	6247440	We ask them right now.
6247440	6248440	Okay.
6248440	6249440	Hey, do you want to take care of these little girls?
6249440	6251440	We don't have room in the wagon.
6251440	6252440	Sure.
6252440	6253440	Why not?
6253440	6256440	Let's just live at the church that we're calling the community center now.
6256440	6257440	Fantastic.
6257440	6258440	All right.
6258440	6262440	We've got church business, stiff, wang, tom, bonnie, gary.
6262440	6263440	Cliff.
6263440	6264440	Cliff.
6265440	6266440	It's been real.
6266440	6267440	It's been fun.
6267440	6269440	But it hasn't been real fun.
6271440	6275440	And we pop in our wagon with pachins in the Pryor.
6275440	6276440	And I take one of those.
6276440	6279440	I take that one, like the mutant boogum arm that I took off.
6279440	6282440	I keep that as evidence to show the people back home what's going on.
6282440	6283440	All right.
6283440	6284440	Yeah.
6284440	6285440	Yeah.
6285440	6286440	Yeah, indeed.
6286440	6287440	You're traveling.
6287440	6290440	You're traveling back to the home office.
6290440	6291440	Oh, man.
6291440	6295440	It's mostly uneventful until nightfall.
6295440	6298440	It's been, let's say it's been a day of travel,
6298440	6300440	so you can reset your spells if you want.
6300440	6301440	We sleep and reset our spells.
6301440	6302440	All right.
6302440	6303440	All right.
6303440	6304440	I'm going to pick a loadout.
6304440	6306440	Pick a loadout, baby.
6306440	6307440	Pick a loadout.
6307440	6308440	Pick a load for me.
6308440	6310440	Pick a load for free.
6310440	6312440	Pick a loadout, Carlos.
6312440	6316440	And put your spell right on, right on.
6316440	6319440	You put the spell right on me.
6319440	6322440	But at night, while you're making camp and sleeping
6322440	6328440	and being like blissfully unaware and stuff, attacks happen.
6328440	6329440	Oh, shit.
6329440	6330440	You get attacked.
6330440	6331440	What?
6331440	6332440	Oh, boy.
6332440	6333440	It's bad news.
6333440	6337440	You're awoken by the sounds of screaming.
6337440	6338440	It's the prior.
6338440	6340440	He's screaming.
6340440	6343440	They look like Banditos.
6343440	6347440	They're surrounding your encampment.
6347440	6351440	I have picked the offensive loadout, just so you know.
6351440	6352440	Banditos.
6352440	6353440	All right.
6353440	6354440	Wow.
6354440	6355440	Wow.
6355440	6359440	There's Banditos in me with my offensive loadout.
6359440	6361440	Gentlemen.
6362440	6369440	You look like people who have lost your way spiritually.
6369440	6373440	Sure, yeah.
6373440	6375440	That can be dangerous.
6375440	6376440	Yeah.
6376440	6379440	For everybody involved.
6379440	6380440	We have nothing to offer you.
6380440	6381440	Why don't you just go on your way?
6381440	6383440	We are but simple men of the cloth.
6383440	6385440	The Church of the Silver Flame.
6385440	6388440	Oh, you got something all right.
6388440	6389440	Yeah?
6389440	6392440	I want to get you with like a knowing look.
6392440	6394440	I give them a knowing look back.
6394440	6396440	Yeah, we do got something.
6396440	6402440	We got a fucking fist to put up your butt.
6402440	6403440	All right.
6403440	6405440	Well, you know, they got weapons.
6405440	6408440	And you guys don't have weapons right now because like you're asleep.
6408440	6411440	So do you want to like grab your weapons?
6411440	6414440	Yes, I always sleep near my chalalie.
6414440	6415440	You are near your weapons.
6415440	6418440	But it's like, you know, now we're in like combat time kind of.
6418440	6420440	So I run to my weapons.
6420440	6421440	Oh, of course.
6421440	6424440	Who would?
6424440	6425440	All right.
6425440	6426440	Well, they attack you guys then.
6426440	6427440	All right.
6427440	6433440	Well, I think they're going to regret this.
6433440	6434440	All right.
6434440	6436440	Well, they might.
6436440	6440440	So the ones in back, you see about six of them.
6440440	6441440	That's all you can see.
6441440	6444440	But you know, you're just waking up and it's hard to say.
6444440	6446440	They shoot arrows, but most of the arrows miss.
6446440	6447440	Only one hits.
6447440	6449440	It's Chad for six damage.
6449440	6450440	Damn it.
6450440	6453440	You take an arrow in the shoulder.
6453440	6454440	All right.
6454440	6457440	I'm using my.
6457440	6460440	Let's see.
6460440	6462440	I'm going to use my defensive loadout on this one.
6462440	6464440	And I can cure my light wounds.
6464440	6467440	OK.
6467440	6468440	Sorry.
6468440	6471440	You cure five wounds.
6471440	6472440	How much damage you take?
6472440	6473440	Six.
6473440	6474440	Six.
6474440	6475440	Oh, boy.
6475440	6477440	You're almost back to full health.
6477440	6478440	Yeah.
6478440	6479440	Yeah.
6479440	6484440	And I take the arrow out and I put it between my fingers and make it like a middle finger
6484440	6486440	and hold it up like that.
6486440	6489440	You do that.
6489440	6494440	And I just fucking hold that like that was enough for now.
6494440	6497440	Is it my turn?
6497440	6498440	No.
6498440	6499440	It's Dan.
6499440	6500440	I know your name.
6500440	6507440	Can I ask you a quick question about my ability to convert any spell of a certain level to
6507440	6509440	a healing spell?
6509440	6513440	So then does that also count for level two spells?
6513440	6514440	Yeah.
6514440	6515440	OK.
6515440	6516440	So it keeps going beyond that, too.
6516440	6517440	Yeah.
6517440	6518440	That's why I don't have heal spells.
6518440	6519440	Right.
6519440	6520440	Yeah.
6520440	6521440	I don't put them in any of the loadouts for that reason.
6521440	6526440	And so it's level one and level two spells that can be turned into that.
6526440	6527440	Correct.
6527440	6539440	Gentlemen, I got to tell you, salvation takes many forms.
6539440	6544440	And it's about to take the form of a giant ant.
6544440	6546440	Summon giant ant.
6546440	6547440	All right.
6547440	6548440	Yeah.
6548440	6550440	Is that a level one or a level two giant ant?
6550440	6551440	Level two.
6551440	6552440	OK.
6552440	6554440	How many level ones and twos do we get?
6554440	6555440	Three.
6555440	6556440	Three a piece?
6557440	6559440	That's not a full question.
6559440	6562440	How many level ones do I get a day?
6562440	6563440	Three.
6563440	6564440	OK.
6564440	6565440	And level twos?
6565440	6566440	Two.
6566440	6567440	OK.
6567440	6568440	All right.
6568440	6569440	You summon a giant ant.
6569440	6571440	It looks really frenzied and angry.
6571440	6573440	Its antenna are waving.
6573440	6574440	Oh, boy.
6574440	6576440	What do you want it to do?
6576440	6578440	Attack the banditos.
6578440	6579440	That makes sense.
6579440	6581440	All right.
6581440	6583440	It misses.
6583440	6588440	It lunges at the bandito, but he rolls out of the way.
6588440	6593440	The banditos, they continue their onslaught.
6593440	6596440	They close in, and they seem to be closing in surrounding
6596440	6601440	pachins and diarrhea who are sleeping nearby each other
6601440	6605440	and both seemingly unconscious even during the melee.
6605440	6608440	Hey, leave them alone.
6608440	6609440	They don't.
6610440	6615440	You guys don't have some kind of bandito code?
6615440	6617440	What?
6617440	6620440	You don't have a bandito code?
6620440	6622440	I don't know what you're talking about.
6622440	6623440	Stab.
6627440	6631440	You're talking to banditos with stabbing weapons.
6631440	6632440	Yeah.
6632440	6635440	Diarrhea and pachins get stabbed.
6635440	6636440	Jesus Christ.
6636440	6639440	Diarrhea takes much worse of a stabbing,
6639440	6642440	and pachins screams and bolts up right awake.
6642440	6645440	This is awful.
6645440	6647440	Oh, yeah.
6647440	6648440	When's it my turn?
6648440	6650440	Now it's the priors' turn.
6650440	6652440	Is he tied up?
6652440	6653440	No, no.
6653440	6655440	He's part of the gang now.
6655440	6656440	He runs away.
6656440	6658440	What's fucking...
6662440	6663440	We don't need that guy.
6663440	6667440	The ship sails faster without the anchor, Carlos.
6667440	6668440	All right.
6668440	6669440	It's Jeff's turn now.
6669440	6671440	Is there vegetation where we are right now?
6671440	6672440	Oh, yeah.
6672440	6674440	Well, then, guess what, everybody?
6674440	6676440	Entangle!
6676440	6677440	Oh, man.
6677440	6678440	It's great.
6678440	6681440	All the plants nearby, they start coming alive,
6681440	6684440	wriggling and waving and entangling.
6684440	6686440	They're grabbing the banditos.
6686440	6687440	Oh, man.
6687440	6689440	How many do they grab?
6689440	6691440	One.
6691440	6693440	Two.
6693440	6694440	Three.
6694440	6695440	All right.
6695440	6696440	They get three of the banditos.
6696440	6697440	They're caught fast.
6697440	6700440	The rest of them are, like, just hacking at the bushes
6700440	6702440	and trying to stay from being entangled.
6702440	6703440	They're kind of like...
6703440	6705440	They're kind of like being...
6705440	6706440	What do you call it?
6706440	6709440	Occupied by the vines and stuff.
6709440	6710440	Yeah.
6710440	6712440	It's taking their attentions away.
6712440	6713440	All right, Carlos.
6713440	6715440	I got them distracted by plant life.
6715440	6719440	Sounds like a good time to inflict light wounds.
6720440	6723440	Can I make a pitch?
6723440	6726440	Inflict heavy wounds.
6726440	6730440	Well, I don't know how to do that yet.
6730440	6732440	I mean, you have a weapon.
6732440	6734440	I'm still working my way up the bridge.
6734440	6735440	Okay.
6735440	6736440	All right.
6736440	6738440	Starting light.
6738440	6740440	All right, you grab one of the guy's arms,
6740440	6742440	his sword-wielding arm,
6742440	6744440	and it shrivels and skinny-fies
6744440	6747440	like it's withering before your very eyes,
6747440	6750440	like a big part of his body just kind of shrivels up
6750440	6752440	like a husk.
6752440	6753440	Mm.
6753440	6755440	Nice.
6755440	6757440	And that was a light wound.
6759440	6760440	All right.
6760440	6762440	The Banditos do stuff.
6762440	6764440	What about my aunt, though, not to be too much of a jerk?
6764440	6766440	No, that's a good call.
6766440	6767440	I forgot.
6767440	6769440	He misses a kid.
6769440	6770440	Sorry.
6770440	6773440	I got to switch dice, how about?
6773440	6776440	I feel like I accidentally summoned, like, a regular aunt.
6777440	6780440	Like a woman that married my uncle.
6780440	6784440	He's just swinging a rolling pin.
6786440	6787440	All right.
6787440	6791440	The withered guy, he starts making an exit.
6791440	6793440	He's, like, trying to escape.
6793440	6795440	The other two, they kind of...
6795440	6796440	Or, not the other two.
6796440	6799440	The other Banditos, they kind of split their forces.
6799440	6802440	One of them continues, or half of them, like,
6802440	6805440	continued their, like, grabbed pachins and stabbing them
6805440	6807440	and, like, dragging them away.
6807440	6811440	And the other ones are turning to fight you guys.
6812440	6815440	These guys are such bad people.
6815440	6817440	So, they don't actually hurt pachins
6817440	6818440	as far as you can tell.
6818440	6820440	But they're trying to drag them off?
6820440	6821440	Yeah, they are.
6821440	6824440	But they are stabbing at you guys.
6824440	6825440	Oh, fucking hell.
6825440	6827440	They only hit you each for two damage.
6827440	6828440	Okay.
6828440	6830440	So, that's their turns.
6830440	6832440	The prior is still gone.
6832440	6834440	Quick question, because this is a new spell for me.
6834440	6836440	If I want to cast Bark Skin and harden my skin,
6836440	6840440	is that something I do prior to an attack or during an attack?
6840440	6843440	Well, it's a standard action, so you cast it whenever.
6843440	6844440	But it lasts for, like, a minute.
6844440	6845440	So, probably do it before...
6845440	6846440	Okay, I don't do it.
6846440	6848440	I've never seen that before.
6848440	6850440	Wait, I got tree shape.
6850440	6851440	I turn into a tree?
6851440	6852440	Yeah.
6852440	6853440	That would be helpful.
6853440	6854440	I'm not doing that.
6854440	6857440	That's just good to have in the bag.
6857440	6858440	Oh, yeah.
6858440	6861440	Well, I'm just attacking nearest Bandito with Morningstar.
6861440	6862440	I think it's Jester.
6862440	6863440	Oh.
6863440	6864440	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6864440	6867440	Carlos, start hitting people like they're little girls.
6867440	6872440	Man, that time you smashed that little girl in the face?
6872440	6873440	We need to be on the same side.
6873440	6876440	This couldn't be more metaphorical.
6876440	6883440	Who cares who voted for Bernie and who voted for Hillary?
6883440	6886440	Let's just beat the Banditos.
6886440	6888440	Bad hombres.
6888440	6890440	Jeff, what are you doing?
6891440	6892440	I vote for Bernie.
6892440	6893440	Firebolt!
6896440	6898440	Firebolt 101.
6899440	6900440	Feel the burn!
6905440	6906440	All right.
6906440	6908440	You catch one of them on fire.
6908440	6910440	He's got his fire.
6910440	6911440	He's on fire.
6911440	6912440	He's running around on fire.
6912440	6913440	Yeah.
6913440	6914440	Oh, boy.
6914440	6917440	We should have just ended on that laugh.
6918440	6919440	No, we've got to kick.
6919440	6920440	We've got to beat these Banditos.
6920440	6922440	Yeah, we've got one more minute or two.
6922440	6925440	So, Carlos, lay it down.
6925440	6927440	Morningstar.
6927440	6929440	On the guy who stabbed Patchens.
6931440	6932440	All right, you miss.
6940440	6943440	That makes it my aunt's turn, and his victories will be mine.
6944440	6945440	What is he going to do?
6945440	6946440	The aunt?
6946440	6947440	Yeah.
6947440	6948440	He's just attacking Banditos.
6948440	6949440	I mean, he's an aunt.
6949440	6950440	All right.
6950440	6951440	How big is his aunt, by the way?
6951440	6952440	What are we talking?
6952440	6953440	It's a giant ant.
6953440	6954440	Yeah.
6954440	6957440	It could be like the size of a bubble bee.
6959440	6960440	As big as a shoe?
6960440	6962440	It doesn't take much for an ant to be giant, does it?
6962440	6963440	Right.
6964440	6965440	How big an ant are we looking at right now?
6965440	6966440	I don't know.
6967440	6969440	Let's say, like, the size of a...
6969440	6970440	Doberman.
6970440	6971440	A mule.
6971440	6972440	Whoa, shit.
6972440	6973440	That's a big ass.
6973440	6974440	That's a big ass.
6975440	6976440	It's thrashing around.
6976440	6977440	All right.
6977440	6978440	Get him, mule.
6978440	6979440	It misses again.
6979440	6980440	He misses again.
6980440	6981440	I'm so sorry.
6981440	6982440	He misses again.
6982440	6986440	Every time, like, what are the odds of rolling the same number on a dice three times?
6986440	6989440	Well, it's 80,000.
6990440	6991440	Who cares?
6992440	6993440	All right.
6993440	6994440	Well, now it's my turn.
6994440	6995440	All right.
6995440	6999440	The Banditos, they stabbed Patchens a couple more times.
6999440	7000440	She don't patch them.
7000440	7001440	They're just so cowardly.
7001440	7002440	She just...
7003440	7005440	You see the ones that don't stab him.
7005440	7008440	They take his clothes off.
7008440	7012440	They, like, strip his clothes off, and then they, like, strip him down naked.
7013440	7014440	Poor Patchens.
7014440	7016440	All he did was back us up, you know?
7016440	7018440	It just felt awful for him.
7019440	7020440	All right.
7020440	7022440	Those guys, their tasks completed.
7022440	7023440	They bone out.
7024440	7025440	They just stole Patchens and left?
7025440	7026440	Well, no.
7026440	7028440	They leave him bleeding on the floor.
7028440	7029440	They took his clothes?
7029440	7030440	Yeah.
7031440	7036440	So these are just really just Banditos who needed clothes.
7037440	7038440	Did they get the relics?
7038440	7039440	No, no.
7039440	7040440	Not yet.
7040440	7041440	Did you try to close?
7041440	7042440	Yeah.
7042440	7046440	There's still a couple that are fighting you, but those ones that were going after Patchens
7046440	7048440	are kind of boning out.
7048440	7051440	We could've had some kind of drive for you guys.
7052440	7055440	We're a church, and you're stealing clothes from us.
7056440	7059440	It's like robbing the Toys for Tots barrel.
7060440	7063440	It's for Tots already.
7064440	7066440	All right, I attack with my Morningstar.
7066440	7067440	All right.
7067440	7068440	Someone.
7069440	7070440	Oh, man.
7070440	7072440	You blast him in the head, and he goes down.
7072440	7074440	You see his helmet is bent.
7074440	7076440	He's wearing a helmet, this guy.
7076440	7077440	He's the only one.
7077440	7080440	I walk over and I take his clothes off, and I put him on Patchens.
7080440	7081440	Okay.
7083440	7086440	Cliffhanger!
7087440	7089440	Oh, yeah.
7091440	7094440	Let's hear it for Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
7097440	7099440	It's here for Kevin Day, Sarah Hale.
7099440	7101440	Very foster on sound tonight.
7101440	7102440	Church.
7102440	7103440	Who else we got?
7104440	7105440	Chris Bulliff.
7105440	7107440	Can I already say Kevin Day?
7107440	7109440	I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
7109440	7110440	Thank everybody here at Harp and Tots.
7110440	7111440	Thank you so much for coming.
7111440	7112440	You're mayor!
7112440	7114440	Mr. Dan Harlan!
7120440	7122440	Megan Bandito!
7138440	7139440	Did you get any of that?
7140440	7142440	It's a cool show!
