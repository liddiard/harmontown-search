0	18180	Hear ye, hear ye, Harmontown is in session.
18180	21600	Welcome everybody to the Nerd Milk Theater in Hollywood, California.
21600	23600	How are you tonight?
23600	24600	Fantastic.
24600	29600	Please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
29600	46680	He's doing a little dance, little side to side.
46680	48040	Is Peter going side to side?
48040	49040	His hands are on his hips.
49040	55560	Oh yeah, sorry, it's a podcast there, sorry, sorry about that podcast listener.
55560	58320	You can't just dance on a podcast.
58320	59320	You can.
60040	65200	That's like the, when people who are big fans of LPs, that was the cracks, pops and whistles
65200	69520	of listening to old school audio recordings metaphorically.
69520	73720	You don't see the little kicky dance when you listen to a Harmontown podcast.
73720	75360	You have to come here to Nerd Milk.
75360	78400	Your dances, historically speaking, are very kicky based.
78400	81040	There's lots of little toe kicks to the side.
81040	88080	I'm a little baby and I'm getting prouder of it as I get older, which is good in a
88080	94000	Kubrickian sense because as we know, we do become babies as we get older.
94000	99360	In my 30s, in my early 30s, there was a shame of the fact that I was a baby because you'd
99360	100360	go out with women.
100360	106840	Sooner or later they find out you're a baby and they actually say the words you're a baby
106840	108360	or you say them.
108360	117040	I'm a baby and I found a girlfriend who is okay with me being a baby.
117040	124840	I specifically enjoy being what she calls a little cloud baby.
124840	127120	Would you explain?
127120	132640	I'd be happy to because we're in a good mood tonight.
132640	138200	I have a big down comforter in my room and it's white and I like to crawl under it and
138200	144640	hold it up to my chin and make a little baby face.
144640	151960	And Aaron makes a sound that is exactly half horror, half orgasm.
151960	152960	Horror?
152960	153960	Yeah.
153960	159640	Well, because she's going out with a baby and she wants a baby.
159640	163400	But she doesn't want to have to fuck it.
163400	164400	No.
164400	171720	But it's making her dignity and her ovaries fight each other and explode.
171720	172800	It's like a Twilight Zone.
172800	174000	Be careful what you wish for.
174000	181080	Yeah, I can't imitate it but I can make a little baby face in bed that will make Aaron
181080	192000	go, I'm in a good mood because I got a call from my doctor today and I got really, really,
192000	195280	really bad news from him.
195280	196880	Congratulations.
196880	201240	I had lab work done.
201240	207360	They suck the plasma out of your body and then they send it off to a lab and you fill
207360	208360	out a clipboard.
208360	209680	What do you want checked?
209680	210680	I want everything checked.
210680	214000	I want to know if I've ever come close to herpes.
214000	216600	I want to know if I've eaten waffles.
216600	220080	I want to know what my liver's doing.
220080	223320	I want to know if my kidneys, everything's just like, okay, those are going to take a
223320	224320	while.
224320	225320	Okay, fine.
225320	226320	Just give it to me.
226320	230680	I'm 39 and it's been a month and they called me today.
230680	236920	There was a mix-up with the phone number and they finally called me and it's dark news
236920	240680	because I'm in perfect condition and the reason it's dark is because now I'm going to kill
240680	246840	myself because I feel like He-Man.
246840	248800	I've done nothing but abuse my body.
248800	253320	My doctor called me today and said, your cholesterol is well within allowances.
254320	259560	We're a fat country so I prefer to look at ideals.
259560	261240	You're one point away from the ideal.
261240	265080	I think if you do a little bit of exercise, you can knock it down to the ideal.
265080	273240	I'm going to go to the Olympics with my cholesterol.
273240	275000	My liver's fine.
275000	277640	Are you kidding me?
277640	278640	That is a lie.
278640	283080	Are you sure he's a doctor?
283840	288760	He may be an elaborate Kettle One sponsor.
288760	291160	Con job, yeah.
291160	296120	I walk out of the place and the whole facade of the Beverly Hills Hospital falls down and
296120	297720	becomes a Kettle One factory.
297720	301600	It becomes a truck and drives on.
301600	305400	Well, it worked.
305400	313840	Yeah, I'm going to do a little bit of exercise from now on and knock that, what's the LDL
313840	314840	and the HDL?
314840	315840	Doesn't matter.
315840	316840	Who cares?
316840	318280	But here's what I care about.
318280	319840	I'm in perfect shape, Jeff.
319840	323440	I'm a perfect specimen.
323440	327160	I'm a super baby, a super cloud baby.
327160	329040	There's nothing wrong with me.
329040	331240	My blood sugar is low.
331240	332560	I can't get diabetes.
332560	333920	I could eat a million Twinkies.
333920	334920	I can't get diabetes.
334920	335920	That's impossible.
335920	336920	That's not true.
336920	337920	No.
337920	338920	You can get diabetes at some point.
338920	339920	If we live long enough, we'll all get diabetes.
339920	340920	You're not a doctor.
340920	344040	It's an age-onset disease.
344040	346360	If you live to be 100, you're going to get diabetes.
346360	349720	If I live to be 100, they're going to have laser spiders that go in your veins and cure
349720	351720	your diabetes.
351720	356680	Dan, we're 200 years away from laser spider technology.
356680	358440	We're 100 years away from laser spiders.
358440	362280	You're talking like you know, all of a sudden, you know a lot about sci-fi.
362280	363640	Oh.
363640	364640	Thank you for the segue, Jeff.
365000	368560	I went to the Chicago West.
368560	374040	Also, not only can you not see our kicky dance, you couldn't see my smug satisfaction about
374040	375040	that segue.
375040	376040	Awesome.
376040	382600	I feel like which part of my instinct is because last week, what we did is we had even people,
382600	386480	unless you were here last week in person, because we haven't podcast that episode yet,
386480	387480	you don't know.
387480	394440	We brought Spencer up and we embarked on our first D&D campaign with Spencer.
394440	399320	And I'll probably let him recap it, but we-
399320	405040	I fucking hope so, because I remember, we talked about mirrors for a long time.
405040	409400	We were pretty drunk, but we met on a road and we killed some goblins.
409400	411920	We went into a cave.
411920	412920	Lots of mirrors and lots of-
412920	419160	And then there was a lot of like, it was like a puzzle game for baby boomers, like mist
419160	420160	with a Y.
421160	426280	It's like you rotate the mirror and then there was like a statue that was red and then there
426280	431600	was a shield that was red and we were so drunk.
431600	437960	Spencer, who is our dungeon master, for those of you who are not following the saga of our
437960	444880	D&D campaign, he walked up to me outside, when people are waiting in line here at Meltdown
444880	450120	Comics, and comes up and he goes, he opened up his book and said, oh shit, I thought
450120	453720	I forgot your characters, but I have them, but I forgot my die.
453720	456200	I forgot my 20-sided die.
456200	463000	And so we went to the front desk here at the comic book store and they were out of them.
463000	467320	So he's going to be rolling dice for us on his iPod application tonight.
467320	468640	Oh really?
468640	471080	Because nobody here has a die.
471080	472080	20-sided?
472080	473080	No.
473080	476080	Jesus, okay, really.
477080	481080	Well, I think it's shame that's keeping you from admitting that you do.
481080	485520	Shame or ignorance, I think some of you are wearing your shirt from prom night and you
485520	488080	forgot you have a 20-sided in your pocket.
488080	493080	Does anybody have a 20-sided die on them right now?
493080	496080	Always, always keep it on you.
496080	498080	You would have been a hero tonight.
498080	499680	But we'll resume our thing with Spencer.
499680	504720	Well that's what I was struggling with, was do we want to warm up for Spencer or do we
504720	508880	want to get him in early so that we're not so drunk that when we get hit with a mirror
508880	513280	puzzle, that was the problem.
513280	514280	You're the mayor, baby.
514280	515280	All right.
515280	521720	Before we bring Spencer up, I want to hear a little bit about your trip because I haven't
521720	524000	seen you for four days.
524000	528480	I went to San Francisco and Chicago since the last time we talked about anything.
528480	530600	San Francisco, I thought that was an interesting thing.
530600	535960	I don't know if podcast listeners, some of you maybe here in San Francisco, there's
535960	539960	a guy outside the Ferry Building.
539960	545640	He's a very old, very Morgan Freeman-y black gentleman.
545640	553200	He's wearing an old suit, like it's his only suit, you can sense that, that he gets up
553200	554760	in the morning and puts on his one suit.
554760	557920	He gives you a very Morgan Freeman vibe.
557920	560400	What do you mean specifically by a Morgan Freeman vibe?
560480	570040	You want him to tell you how to golf or play the clarinet or use the force or be a librarian
570040	571160	or love a woman.
571160	575240	You want him to- You want a mystical black friend.
575240	576240	Yeah.
576240	578400	He exudes that air.
578400	583560	He's ancient and he's got a big smile on his face and he's holding a clarinet and he's got
583560	590160	the clarinet case with a recyclable bag in it for tips and he's got a hat on.
590160	593880	When I walked up to, Aaron was going to the bathroom, the bathroom line was so long that
593880	596920	I got to kind of study this guy for a while.
596920	601880	If you walk past him, all you see is, oh, it's a master of clarinet sitting on the,
601880	606640	literally on the dock of the bay hanging out.
606640	609240	Watching the tide go away?
609240	611280	My God, I wish I was a better person.
611280	617840	I wish I had more appreciation for whatever jazzy arts he could impart to me.
618840	623440	I was waiting for Aaron so long that I kind of stood behind him and watched what was really
623440	624440	happening.
624440	629240	He's really just, he knows as much clarinet as I do.
629240	631200	He kept doing this thing.
631200	635600	It was like an SNL sketch.
635600	640440	He was continually rereading his clarinet while he was talking to people.
640440	643920	He would shout out to people and they'd stop and talk to him.
644000	648600	Then he was just continually in preparation to play the clarinet.
648600	657440	When I arrived at him, it was at the end of an encounter that he was having for seemingly
657440	662440	hours with this old white couple that were like, oh no, we got to go, I'm sorry, we never
662440	665640	got to hear you play, but here's the first five dollars.
665640	670000	He's like, oh, take care of her, I wouldn't want to have a ... Then this other weird encounter
670000	679200	happened where a guy walked by, it's like an 80-year-old guy with a 50-year-old woman.
679200	684440	The clarinet guy said, oh, hey, what's going on?
684440	686520	He would just shout stuff out at random people.
686520	692000	He shouted several things out at me, but I'm Generation X, so I'd just go, huh, and look
692000	694520	at a bird.
694520	702520	But old white people would stop and go, well, just the weather and the knees and the kneecaps.
702520	709800	They would have this old person language with like, oh, Truman never got dewy.
709800	714720	They would engage each other, it was like ants, the specific species would get into
714720	716800	it.
716800	724160	That happened, he snagged another old guy, it was this 50-year-old white woman, the old
724160	732400	white guy, and the old white guy said, well, this is my daughter, and he said, oh, I thought
732400	739400	that was your wife, and then the old guy said, oh, you wish me to have a heart attack?
739400	749960	A woman this age, that's a good way to wish me to get a heart attack, fucking my daughter.
749960	754800	That's 22% of deaths over the age of 75.
754800	762080	And then he kept walking away, and the clarinet guy, he waited, it was like a block away,
762080	765600	the guy, there's no way he was going to hear him, but he kind of, the gears ground, and
765600	770120	he kind of heard him, and then he thought of something to say to him, I wish sometimes
770120	774120	she was your wife, though.
774120	778600	And then he finally, finally, after- He played a string of pearls.
778600	782400	The 30 minutes that it took Aaron to go to the bathroom at this place, because the line
782400	786520	was so long, I finally saw this guy, I finally put this thing to his lips, because I think
786520	793840	part of the thing is he needs to at some point create a seam of illusion that he just finished
793840	796360	or just started playing clarinet.
796360	800360	Always just finished, always just finished.
800360	805440	I was in his blind side, I was standing behind him, flanking him and just watching him, and
805440	808880	so he put the clarinet to his lips and I was like, okay, here we go.
808880	813400	I blow my mind or confirm what I suspect.
813400	842560	And he went-
842560	846240	That's already Shaw.
846240	853480	Scales I think he was doing, but worse, because he hadn't seen Sound of Music, and then put
853480	857280	his prop back down and then just started shouting out everybody in the pair.
857280	864160	I don't know if that's interesting to anybody, but I thought it was very interesting.
864160	865960	The clarinet is a very difficult instrument.
865960	868680	There's a guy that lives on my street.
868680	870440	I don't know if he lives on my street.
870800	873080	There's a mystery person.
873080	880640	I went away on a trip to France last year and for three months before I left town, I
880640	886320	would hear, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
886320	889760	and it was like start quiet and get louder and louder and louder.
889760	893680	And there was a clarinetist that had just taken up like fucking residents on my street
893680	897120	and he would wander around and I'd never saw him.
897120	902800	And I went out of town, apparently he'd taken up residents on my lawn and actually a neighbor
902800	905000	called the police and took him to jail.
905000	911440	The guy went to jail and I wanted to kill the guy because the clarinet is not an easy
911440	912440	instrument to play.
912440	914240	It was terrible.
914240	916760	And so he went to jail for a while, apparently.
916760	917760	Now he's reemerged.
917760	921800	I don't know the name of the instrument, but it's the one that you charm a snake with.
921800	931560	In the middle of the fucking morning or afternoon, there's a guy, the cobra-phone, the cobra-phone.
931560	933800	And I finally saw him.
933800	939720	He's an old, wisdom-grade, bearded guy with a giant clarinet thing with ribbons hanging
939720	940720	off of it.
940720	943200	That's, yeah, it's the worst.
943200	948360	Do you remember the guy, were you living in Las Feliz when that guy, he was a living,
948360	949960	he was the Forrest Gump of 9-11.
949960	950960	The rising raving guy?
950960	960360	Yeah, like the Persian guy that one day before 9-11, not Iranian, Persian.
960360	967200	Every day leading up to 9-11, because I lived in Las Feliz from 90 whatever to 2001, just
967200	971320	every single day at the same time of day there would be this guy, you would hear him at any
971320	977960	place in Las Feliz, he wasn't homeless, but he was clearly mentally ill.
977960	981600	I think he had a support system, and then the support system would say, yes, you can
981600	984440	take a walk, Kyle.
984440	990600	And then on his walk, it was just an hour a day, I don't want to be like literally
990600	994480	the cable guy and give him a name that I'm going to regret, but I don't want to riff
994480	1000880	on a name, but he, I want to assume his name's Kyle.
1000880	1004440	His name was Xerxes.
1004440	1008520	Every day at the same time, you would just hear this in the distance, because I would
1008520	1011600	be riding with Shrav in my living room, and then you'd just hear from way in the distance
1011600	1012600	here.
1012600	1023200	And there'd be a Doppler effect because he'd walk past your place like an ice cream man.
1023200	1028120	And it was before 9-11, and it didn't really matter, it was just like, oh, that's a different
1028120	1033240	kind of crazy guy, better than saying I want to strangle your children, I can't understand
1033240	1034240	it, it's kind of delicious.
1034240	1035240	I like it.
1035240	1039640	It's like an orange pop-up instead of the traditional vanilla bean.
1039640	1045720	And then fucking, it was so clear, like 9-11 happened, because I was living in that same
1045720	1051800	place, and you just like, never, ever, that guy vanished, and he was like, some white
1051800	1054440	van came and just sucked him up with a vacuum cleaner.
1054440	1056320	No, I think his family said, Kyle.
1056320	1059440	Oh, Kyle, no more walks.
1059440	1060440	They're watching the news.
1061080	1063880	As much as we'd like you to get out of the house once in a while, we don't want you to
1063880	1064880	get killed.
1064880	1070680	Yeah, they were watching the news of 7-11s with American flags draped in the front windows
1070680	1072960	because everyone was terrified of everybody.
1072960	1074920	It was a horrible time.
1074920	1080760	A lot of you were six, and don't remember how horrifying it was.
1080760	1087360	I remember the moments after 9-11, driving with Jeff, my comptroller, down Franklin Avenue
1087360	1090880	over where Birds and UCB is there now, it wasn't there then.
1090880	1095520	And I remember just driving at night, and like, you couldn't drive.
1095520	1101600	It was exactly like after a hockey game, where someone won or lost that wasn't significant
1101600	1106560	to the same demographic, like the traffic blockers.
1106560	1111160	Because 9-11 happened, and there was just, the traffic was slow everywhere, you're like,
1111160	1112160	why is traffic slow?
1112160	1113720	Is there a 9-11 happening here too?
1113720	1119560	No, it's just a bunch of 9-11 fans out in the street, and they were like lining the
1119560	1125400	street with, some of them with candles, okay fine, that's sentimental, that's nice.
1125400	1131120	I remember seeing like a bunch of dudes with baseball caps on backwards with a bed sheet
1131120	1135960	that said USA on it, a bed sheet that they just grabbed, it's like, wait, Steve, grab
1135960	1139400	the bed sheet, and write the name of our country on it.
1139400	1140400	With what?
1141160	1145360	It's crucial that we do it now, we're about to lose everything.
1145360	1150840	The towers have gone down, our beds are next.
1150840	1156720	Let them know on Franklin Avenue that what country this is.
1156720	1161200	And they were chanting or driving, the cars were like, it was bumper to bumper traffic,
1161200	1166960	gridlock, and it was just people going, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
1167280	1174040	Jeff and I were like coiling down in our seats, going, we're actors and writers, we're dead,
1174040	1178840	the next 10 years is not going to be fun.
1178840	1184720	But then we elected a black man, I don't know, so what did I know?
1184720	1188160	That was several years later.
1188160	1189800	Society's never finished, what do you think it is?
1189800	1191920	We're progressive.
1191920	1194120	It seemed that night that we were dead.
1194200	1198200	Do you have any, what do you think, Obama, Romney?
1198200	1199800	Who do you like?
1199800	1200800	Who do you like, Roman?
1200800	1203800	Boy, that Romney, he's got pluck.
1207400	1208400	He's got zazz.
1208400	1209400	I spent five minutes.
1209400	1212960	I couldn't believe, I thought that was a bit, I thought it was a bit that he was actually
1212960	1215160	the finalist, like that he was the new McCain.
1215160	1220240	I thought there was an actual onion bit or something.
1220240	1222560	He says nothing, it's insane.
1222560	1226640	It's like a parody of a parody of something that's already a parody.
1226640	1231600	I'm not even, I would characterize myself as being left of what most people would call
1231600	1239040	liberal because I really don't like the idea that we all accept that government is necessary.
1239040	1245720	It's a bummer, and I know it is, to keep everything in place now, but I think that it should be
1245720	1250240	our goal to go, can't everybody stop telling people what to do?
1250240	1255200	I just don't like this class of people running against each other in these popularity contests,
1255200	1257400	and they've never done anything in their life.
1257400	1258560	They've never lifted a box.
1258560	1259960	They've never washed a dish.
1259960	1261080	They've never written anything.
1261080	1265760	They've never directed anything.
1265760	1269000	I skewed toward my current audience in the last couple.
1269000	1271200	They were never nominated for a Hugo Award?
1271200	1273920	They don't know how to blow glass.
1273920	1276560	They don't know how to take care of children.
1276560	1279080	They don't know how to eat their own food, I doubt.
1279080	1284400	I bet there's a guy that squeezes a fireplace thing into their mouth with pudding in it
1284400	1291120	or something, or like Robocop paste that's designed to keep them more political.
1291120	1292240	They're not real people.
1292240	1293240	They don't do anything.
1293240	1295240	It squeezes a fireplace thing.
1295240	1296600	It's democracy.
1296600	1302680	The idea is supposed to be, the ideal is supposed to be that we would all be farming, and then
1302680	1308120	we would go, hey, Steve, you've got to be a councilman, and Steve would go, fuck you.
1308160	1309120	I got farming to do.
1309120	1312760	Sorry, Steve, you're a very charismatic farmer.
1312760	1317920	We need you to go to the big city and make sure that they understand how hard it is to
1317920	1318920	farm out here.
1318920	1320920	All right, but fuck you guys.
1320920	1322920	Two years and I'm out.
1322920	1323920	Exactly.
1323920	1326440	It's written into the rules.
1326440	1330760	And that's supposed to trickle up, that mentality, like the guy that's president should be like
1330760	1336240	to everyone in America, fuck you for making me do this, but I will spend, because I'm
1336240	1340960	an American, I will spend the next four years trying to make it as easy on you as possible.
1340960	1343760	I'll try to keep these trains running out of time.
1343760	1348000	But our predilection for hero worship and royalty fucking took over.
1348000	1354760	And then who seeps in, these disgusting, gross, Oxford-shirted, fucking, they just gross schmooze.
1354760	1358080	These people, they're proto-human.
1358080	1359080	None of them.
1359080	1364760	And I'm sorry, but I include all your favorite people, and I think that I do.
1364760	1369520	And the fact that I'm afraid to say the words, I include Obama for fear that I'll get, like
1369520	1373240	politics turns us all into fascists.
1373240	1378080	You start to get afraid to say the wrong thing around your friends, and they capitalize on
1378080	1382800	that instead of going the other way, which is to say, look, we all have a wolf in us.
1382800	1386920	We all want to chew each other's throats out, but we're also all monkeys.
1386920	1389080	We all just want to fucking eat berries.
1389080	1393320	So let's try to spiritually realign ourselves.
1393320	1394440	Let's find the sweet spot.
1394440	1397080	Yeah, right in the middle.
1397080	1398080	That's what humans are.
1398080	1403800	We're the monkeys that survived wolves by adopting their practices a little bit.
1403800	1408840	But we gotta, you know, it's just such a bummer.
1408840	1413160	Every four years, it gets more and more, I get more and more crotchety, and I don't know
1413160	1414840	what to do about it.
1414840	1418000	Young people get so excited, and you don't want to piss on that.
1418960	1423600	Of course, Obama's a better president than some fucking clone from a Republican vat in
1423600	1431480	the basement of the Pentagon, obviously, but that's like saying, like, Diet Pepsi's better
1431480	1436720	than piss.
1436720	1438800	Neither of it's water.
1438800	1440080	Water is what you need.
1440080	1441080	You're dying of thirst.
1441080	1447760	We need to sustain ourselves, we're human beings, and I feel the same way about religious
1447760	1451920	debate, you know, and people go, oh, are you an atheist, or are you one of these snake
1451920	1453520	handler types, you know?
1453520	1457200	Like, oh, yeah, I have to choose between those two?
1457200	1459680	You guys are all on the same side.
1459680	1464720	When you kneel before a fundamentalist God and like quiver and go like, oh, the Bible's
1464720	1465720	a newspaper.
1465720	1470280	Here's what happened last Wednesday in 3000 BC.
1470280	1473840	And also when you're getting out your slide rule and going like, well, I don't know until
1473840	1475920	I prove it.
1475920	1479000	You all agree on one thing.
1479000	1482760	You're all on the same side, because if I said one thing, I could make you all disagree
1482760	1483760	with me.
1483760	1490760	If I said, Dan Harmon is God, atheists and scientists would all throw rocks at me.
1490760	1496440	They would all go, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're not God, but maybe I am.
1496440	1498280	Why is that not allowed?
1498280	1503200	That's the Ralph Nader of religion.
1503200	1508520	But for each of us, your God, your God, your God, your God, everyone's going like, step
1508520	1510000	right up to the taste test.
1510000	1512240	Do you believe in God or not believe in God?
1512240	1515120	Last name first, first name second, do you believe in God or not believe in God?
1515120	1516120	Do you believe in God?
1516120	1517120	Do you believe in God?
1517120	1520440	Do you choose between math and a story about a guy getting eaten by a whale?
1520440	1521440	You have to choose.
1521440	1522440	You have to choose.
1522440	1523440	You have to choose.
1523440	1527360	No, I don't have to choose, because both of those exist and both came out of my species'
1527360	1528360	mind.
1528360	1531920	I'm capable, I have a processor in my brain that's more powerful than anything Apple could
1531920	1535720	ever generate, because it's capable of thinking two things at once, both equally.
1535720	1538080	I am capable of creation.
1538080	1539800	I am capable of mysticism.
1539800	1541600	I am capable of mythology.
1541600	1546720	I'm capable of approaching my life from a logical and mythical perspective.
1546720	1547840	And I'm capable of both.
1547840	1549400	And you want to compromise me.
1549400	1550880	You want me in shackles.
1550880	1555640	Don't make me choose between Pepsi and Coke, because you're just pushing corn syrup.
1555640	1557040	That's it.
1557040	1560240	And I feel that way about politics, and I feel that way about religion.
1560240	1565280	And God damn it, I was in a good mood when I came up here.
1565280	1571000	We should bring Spencer up.
1571000	1572000	Spencer get up here.
1572000	1573000	Dungeon Master Spencer.
1573000	1574000	How's it going?
1574000	1575000	Come on.
1575000	1576000	Come on.
1576000	1577000	Stay, Spencer.
1577000	1578000	Say hello to the crowd.
1578000	1579000	Let me get up here.
1579000	1580000	Yeah.
1580000	1581000	Hello audience!
1581000	1582000	Hello audience!
1582000	1583000	Hello audience!
1583000	1584000	Hello audience!
1584000	1585000	Hello audience!
1585000	1586000	Hello audience!
1586000	1587000	Hello audience!
1587000	1588000	Hello audience!
1589000	1590000	Hello audience!
1595000	1597000	Spencer, I'm guessing you're a cat person.
1597000	1601000	Yeah, I have a cat named Jason.
1601000	1603000	I'm a cat person too.
1603000	1605000	You feel like a cat to me.
1605000	1607000	I asked him to come up to stage.
1607000	1609000	He did so unwillingly.
1609000	1613000	He's neither David Spade nor is he Roberto Benigni.
1613000	1616000	He's right in the middle.
1616000	1617000	He just glares at you.
1617000	1620000	If you have some kibble in your hand, he'll eat it.
1620000	1621000	I love it.
1621000	1622000	I don't know.
1622000	1625000	I just wanted to say I love you.
1625000	1628000	It's hard for our kind to express love to each other.
1628000	1631000	The Dungeons and Dragons people.
1631000	1634000	It's true, yeah.
1634000	1636000	Do you love me?
1636000	1637000	Yeah, I love you.
1637000	1642000	I was just...
1642000	1645000	I was just thinking that there should be a universal symbol
1646000	1648000	of just like acknowledgement and benevolence
1648000	1650000	that we could just express to one another.
1650000	1652000	So like if you wanted people to live for a long time
1652000	1655000	but also prosper, like...
1657000	1660000	If there was a way with maybe a hand signal.
1660000	1662000	Something you could do with your fingers.
1662000	1665000	Where maybe two fingers touch the other two fingers.
1665000	1667000	Just to get down to the logic of it all.
1667000	1669000	You know, I agree.
1669000	1671000	Dan, Spencer, you know what it is.
1671000	1672000	It's called a hug.
1672000	1673000	No, it's not.
1673000	1674000	A hug?
1674000	1677000	No, if you're just driving down the street and you see a guy sit...
1677000	1678000	Hug.
1678000	1679000	Hug.
1679000	1680000	Hug.
1683000	1684000	Kiss.
1684000	1685000	Kiss.
1685000	1686000	Kiss.
1686000	1688000	It's like a Greek wedding.
1690000	1692000	Anyways, do we derail you?
1692000	1693000	Are you going to say something?
1693000	1694000	Just, yeah, no.
1694000	1695000	Just the symbol.
1695000	1696000	The hand symbol's cool.
1696000	1697000	Yeah.
1697000	1698000	I agree.
1698000	1699000	I think we all agree.
1699000	1701000	It's Harman Town where we should be safe to...
1701000	1705000	And in Harman Town, the new Yahtzee will be Dungeons and Dragons.
1705000	1708000	You want to set up your stuff and...
1710000	1715000	Is it possible to cover the time of you having to unsheathe your tomes
1715000	1719000	with a recap of what happened so far?
1719000	1721000	Unsheath your tomes.
1721000	1723000	The problem is I have a written down.
1723000	1726000	Unsheath your tomes!
1727000	1728000	Oh, sorry.
1729000	1730000	I don't know.
1730000	1731000	No, no.
1731000	1732000	No, no.
1732000	1733000	Follow your heart.
1733000	1734000	Follow your heart.
1734000	1737000	Make your books naked to the world.
1742000	1745000	Unbind your pages.
1745000	1748000	Flip to the chapter of my heart.
1753000	1754000	You did it.
1754000	1755000	Yeah.
1755000	1756000	The Television Academy agrees.
1756000	1759000	Gave me an Emmy for Best Original Lyrics.
1759000	1760000	Once.
1760000	1762000	I don't know if I ever mentioned that.
1765000	1767000	Anyways, we...
1767000	1770000	For those of you who have never been here before,
1770000	1776000	Jeff and I have embarked on a historic new podcasting experiment,
1776000	1780000	which is we're playing Dungeons and Dragons on our podcast.
1780000	1783000	It's probably someone else that's doing it, but fuck them.
1783000	1784000	It's podcast dynamite.
1785000	1786000	This guy's nodding in the front row.
1786000	1787000	Are you doing it on your podcast?
1787000	1788000	Is that why you're here?
1788000	1789000	No, but there's a lot of podcasts.
1789000	1790000	All right.
1790000	1791000	Well, all right.
1791000	1792000	Fine.
1793000	1795000	He said there's a lot of podcasts.
1795000	1796000	Yeah, of course there is.
1796000	1797000	That makes sense.
1798000	1799000	That actually makes it...
1799000	1802000	D&D and porn are probably the first things to arrive anywhere.
1802000	1804000	There's a new technology.
1806000	1808000	And they're the same people asking that question.
1808000	1814000	Can we use this to role play while taking a break from jerking off?
1815000	1817000	Well, we should ask him then.
1817000	1818000	Are there pitfalls?
1818000	1820000	Are there things that we should do or not do?
1820000	1821000	Well, that's a good idea.
1821000	1822000	Well, let's bring him up here.
1822000	1823000	Can you mind coming up?
1823000	1824000	Come on up on stage.
1824000	1826000	You won't be humiliated.
1826000	1827000	Share my card.
1828000	1829000	What's your name, sir?
1830000	1831000	My name's Greg.
1831000	1832000	Greg, okay.
1833000	1838000	So, Greg, you've seen Dungeons and Dragons play in other podcasts.
1839000	1840000	Yes.
1840000	1842000	I've listened to it played on other podcasts.
1842000	1849000	So, like Jeff said, are there things that we should avoid?
1850000	1855000	Give us some do's and don'ts for podcasting our D&D campaign.
1856000	1861000	What's the biggest mistake you think has ever been made aside from the action itself?
1862000	1866000	Also, Greg, take your shirt off.
1869000	1870000	Oh, geez.
1873000	1875000	Okay, I've listened to a lot of role playing game podcasts.
1875000	1878000	They do live D&D games and other stuff.
1880000	1883000	Generally, I stop listening to them because the people are sort of intolerable.
1884000	1885000	Oh, interesting.
1886000	1888000	Well, if that was going to stop anybody, I'd be dead by now.
1889000	1891000	How do we stay tolerable?
1892000	1895000	Yeah, expound on that, can you, without making too many enemies?
1896000	1897000	Oh, yeah.
1897000	1898000	How about this?
1898000	1899000	I'm going to lower your mic.
1899000	1900000	Oh, that'll help.
1900000	1902000	What makes them intolerable?
1904000	1908000	Generally, it's people laughing too much when they quote Monty Python.
1909000	1910000	Nice.
1911000	1912000	All right.
1912000	1914000	No Monty Python quote.
1914000	1915000	Yeah, that sort of thing.
1915000	1919000	You guys are new enough that you probably don't have any in-jokes from about four campaigns ago.
1920000	1923000	But that's an easy thing to fall into, those in-jokes.
1924000	1926000	Yeah, in-jokes are hard.
1927000	1929000	I would suggest maybe keeping it short.
1930000	1932000	Yeah, that's a good rule with anything.
1933000	1935000	I missed the last one, so I don't know how this went last time.
1936000	1937000	We didn't keep it short.
1940000	1942000	We fell into your third sand trap.
1943000	1944000	We fell into your third sand trap.
1945000	1947000	There was a dogleg in the first fairway enemy.
1948000	1952000	Since I'm on the spot, that did come up in line while I was...
1954000	1959000	There's people going, I hope they don't do three chapters of the laser lights with the statues.
1960000	1965000	Yeah, I mean, having been stuck in mirror puzzle-type things myself in D&D games,
1966000	1970000	I would say that if I was the DM, I might lean more towards something
1971000	1975000	which would allow you guys to roleplay and riff off each other than having to figure something out.
1976000	1977000	Right, right.
1978000	1979000	Greg, everybody.
1984000	1985000	Well done, Greg. Thank you very much.
1986000	1988000	Well, that was wolf in sheep's clothing, wasn't it?
1991000	1993000	Nobody expects this baddest inquisition.
2001000	2002000	I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself.
2004000	2006000	Spencer, catch the audience up and catch us up.
2007000	2009000	Where did we leave off last time on our campaign?
2010000	2013000	All right, well, I should say I was just testing the audience.
2014000	2016000	I do have dice. I'm really disappointed in all of you.
2019000	2020000	He had actual dice.
2021000	2023000	He pretended to lose them to see who would have dice.
2024000	2026000	You were just a clever pawn in my game, Jeff.
2026000	2030000	Well, now that's a dungeon master.
2032000	2033000	Also, that's a liar.
2035000	2036000	Same thing.
2036000	2037000	He's a mastermind.
2037000	2039000	All right. You have your 20-side?
2040000	2041000	Yeah. Yeah, I got it all.
2041000	2042000	You son of a bitch.
2043000	2044000	Don't underestimate him.
2045000	2046000	All right.
2046000	2047000	Or trust him.
2049000	2050000	Don't do either.
2051000	2054000	These are the chronicles of Sharpie and Quark,
2054000	2058000	heroes whose names are etched into the very walls of fate itself.
2059000	2061000	Who made destiny their bitch?
2062000	2065000	Our heroes were last seen hacking goblins to pieces
2065000	2069000	and rearranging mirrors deep in the bowels of the trove.
2069000	2071000	You were in the dark passage of a small cave,
2071000	2074000	but you can see that it opens up into a great cavern.
2074000	2075000	A pit stretches out before you,
2075000	2078000	but you can see a rickety old bridge bridging the gap.
2079000	2081000	Oh. Let's cross that bridge.
2081000	2083000	Yeah. I mean, if it was going to break, it would have broken by now.
2083000	2084000	Right.
2085000	2086000	I should warn you,
2087000	2090000	across the cavern lies an enormous white pig
2090000	2093000	wallowing in a glimmering pile of treasure.
2094000	2096000	Wait. He's underneath the bridge?
2096000	2097000	He's across the bridge.
2098000	2099000	If we cross that bridge,
2099000	2101000	there's a white pig with some treasure?
2102000	2103000	Yep.
2103000	2104000	A living pig?
2104000	2106000	It's a gigantic pig.
2106000	2107000	A white pig?
2107000	2109000	A white, an albino pig.
2109000	2110000	You can see it.
2111000	2114000	I have a plus seven against albino pigs.
2115000	2116000	I'm making that up.
2116000	2117000	He's making it up.
2118000	2119000	All right.
2120000	2122000	Rickety bridge worries me.
2122000	2123000	Well, okay.
2124000	2125000	Craig, any ideas?
2126000	2128000	Yeah, I didn't think so.
2130000	2132000	It's just, yeah, it's fucking scary.
2133000	2135000	And a rickety bridge, albino pig.
2135000	2137000	I want that treasure, Harmon.
2138000	2139000	I want that pig.
2139000	2142000	I want that treasure, sharpie butzilla.
2143000	2145000	I call out to the pig.
2146000	2148000	It doesn't seem to see you.
2148000	2150000	It's interested in wallowing in treasure.
2150000	2151000	I think it's an illusion.
2152000	2155000	But the odd thing is, it's mocking us.
2155000	2156000	Like, I think it's saying,
2156000	2157000	hey, look, you're pigs, right?
2157000	2158000	You want treasure.
2159000	2160000	Maybe because of my small size,
2160000	2162000	can I get across that bridge without any trouble?
2162000	2164000	You can definitely try to sneak across the bridge.
2164000	2166000	I'm going to sneak across that bridge, Spencer.
2166000	2167000	All right.
2168000	2169000	I'm rolling the dice.
2169000	2170000	Uh-oh.
2171000	2172000	All right.
2172000	2173000	You managed to cross the bridge,
2173000	2175000	but you hear a couple creaks.
2176000	2177000	Did I?
2177000	2178000	But I'm across it?
2178000	2179000	You are across it.
2179000	2183000	So I probably worried about fat ass, sharpie butzilla
2183000	2184000	getting across it.
2185000	2186000	That's fat.
2186000	2187000	I'm just not deformed.
2188000	2189000	I'm sorry.
2189000	2191000	I'm a little people.
2194000	2195000	Hey, sharpie, get over here.
2195000	2196000	It's great.
2197000	2199000	I heard creaks, fucker.
2202000	2204000	Check out the pig.
2205000	2206000	Can I?
2206000	2208000	I check out the pig.
2208000	2210000	The pig is wallowing in treasure.
2210000	2213000	It stands a good 10 feet tall at the shoulder.
2213000	2216000	Its eyes gleam yellow like topaz jewels.
2216000	2217000	Can I attack this pig?
2217000	2218000	You are far off.
2218000	2219000	You're about 30 feet away.
2219000	2220000	You'd have to charge it.
2220000	2221000	I'm going to charge a pig.
2225000	2227000	I didn't come this far to not charge pigs.
2228000	2230000	I'm a barbarian gnome.
2230000	2232000	I come from a long line of pig chargers.
2234000	2236000	Leaving sharpie across on the other side of the bridge,
2236000	2238000	you draw your sword and charge towards the pig.
2238000	2239000	Yep.
2239000	2242000	It stands up in anticipation of your coming strike.
2242000	2246000	And as you see it, you noticed a few gold coins fall from its mouth.
2247000	2248000	You swing at the pig.
2249000	2251000	It's a treasure eating pig.
2251000	2252000	You miss.
2252000	2253000	Uh-oh.
2253000	2254000	Oh, shit.
2254000	2258000	Your blade glances harmily off the pig's skin.
2258000	2260000	You hear a sharp tink.
2260000	2261000	Uh-oh.
2261000	2264000	I'm telling you, it's like some kind of golem or something.
2265000	2267000	I got to get over there and help my little semi-friend.
2267000	2269000	Just cross the bridge.
2269000	2271000	Jackass.
2272000	2275000	I'm getting my ass kicked by an albino pig over here.
2275000	2276000	Okay.
2276000	2280000	I remember from my history that I cast feather fall on myself
2280000	2282000	to get out of that tower I was kept prison in.
2282000	2283000	Uh-huh.
2283000	2285000	So I assume that's one of my spells.
2285000	2286000	You've forgotten it.
2291000	2293000	How convenient.
2296000	2299000	The pig poises, ready to strike at your friend.
2299000	2300000	All right.
2300000	2302000	I bound across the bridge, by the way,
2302000	2305000	planting my full weight on each footfall.
2308000	2310000	With ease, you cross the bridge.
2310000	2311000	Ah, see?
2311000	2312000	A few strides.
2312000	2314000	You're across the bridge.
2315000	2316000	All right.
2316000	2318000	Now you can attack or cast a spell.
2318000	2319000	Okay.
2319000	2320000	Or do nothing.
2320000	2321000	You can wait.
2321000	2322000	All right.
2322000	2323000	Can I attack again?
2323000	2324000	It's his turn.
2324000	2325000	That would be the pig's turn.
2325000	2330000	Does sleep work on potentially inanimate pigs?
2331000	2333000	You can certainly try it.
2335000	2336000	I didn't learn anything about it.
2336000	2339000	In wizard school, you learn that if this was, in fact,
2339000	2342000	some sort of construct pig, it wouldn't work.
2342000	2344000	But if it was a living pig, it probably would.
2344000	2347000	But living pigs are usually not 10 feet tall.
2347000	2350000	Construct pig.
2353000	2355000	Ray of frost!
2355000	2357000	You cast ray of frost.
2357000	2360000	A blue beam shoots towards the pig.
2362000	2367000	The beam connects squarely in the face of the pig.
2367000	2368000	Fuck yeah.
2368000	2369000	I'm not useless.
2369000	2370000	Yeah.
2370000	2372000	Took you long enough to get across that bridge.
2372000	2375000	He takes two damage of cold.
2376000	2379000	Let's hope it's a first level giant white pig.
2381000	2382000	Okay.
2382000	2386000	The pig reacting to the beam hitting it in the face rears up
2386000	2390000	and brings its feet down on Jeff.
2390000	2391000	I can't talk.
2391000	2392000	Quark.
2392000	2393000	Yeah.
2393000	2394000	Quark.
2394000	2395000	Am I okay?
2395000	2396000	Let's see.
2397000	2399000	What's your armor class?
2399000	2400000	17.
2400000	2401000	17.
2401000	2402000	Give it to me straight Spencer.
2402000	2403000	How am I?
2404000	2406000	I got a 10 foot fake pig.
2406000	2408000	The pig foot lands on your chest,
2408000	2411000	but the armor manages to protect you.
2412000	2414000	You are on the floor, but unharmed.
2414000	2415000	Sweet.
2417000	2418000	All right.
2418000	2419000	Now go.
2419000	2421000	So you're on the floor so you can get up probably.
2421000	2422000	I get up.
2422000	2424000	You leap to your feet.
2425000	2428000	I run behind my friend.
2430000	2433000	Hightailing it away, you attempt to outrun the pig,
2433000	2436000	but the pig makes a swipe at your back.
2436000	2437000	Oh, shit.
2438000	2439000	I had my chance.
2439000	2443000	Much like the first blow, this one manages to avoid hitting you.
2443000	2444000	All right.
2444000	2445000	You escape safely.
2445000	2446000	I do have a giant sword, don't I?
2446000	2447000	Yes.
2447000	2449000	I would attack that pig one more time.
2449000	2450000	All right.
2450000	2454000	You roll around and slash the pig in the face.
2456000	2458000	You connect with the pig's face.
2458000	2461000	A crack appears right across its nose.
2465000	2467000	We'll be right back.
2471000	2472000	Is it my turn?
2472000	2473000	You can go ahead.
2473000	2474000	Yes.
2475000	2477000	I have to ask you a quick question as a dungeon master.
2477000	2478000	Yeah, any questions.
2478000	2482000	I have a list of spells here, and then I have check marks on some of those spells.
2482000	2484000	You can cast the ones with check marks right now.
2484000	2486000	Later, you can change them.
2486000	2487000	Oops.
2487000	2488000	Okay.
2489000	2490000	Oh, boy.
2490000	2491000	Magic missile.
2491000	2493000	You cast magic missile.
2493000	2494000	On the pig.
2494000	2497000	A blinding sphere of light shoots forth from your palms
2497000	2499000	and strikes the pig right in its leg.
2500000	2501000	Leg?
2501000	2502000	Let me get a dice.
2502000	2503000	Aim for the face.
2505000	2506000	A dude.
2507000	2509000	I'm into the arcane arts.
2511000	2513000	You hit it for four damage.
2513000	2514000	See?
2514000	2516000	That's like twice as much as your sword, by the way.
2517000	2520000	I didn't say out loud the sword did seven damage.
2522000	2523000	Sorry, Sharpie.
2523000	2525000	Twice as much as my ray of frost.
2526000	2527000	I'm getting better.
2530000	2534000	Your arcane magic missile strikes the pig.
2534000	2535000	It is angry.
2535000	2537000	It charges you, Sharpie.
2538000	2540000	It's barreling right towards you.
2541000	2542000	Let's see if it connects.
2545000	2546000	The pig plows right into you.
2546000	2548000	It knocks you up into the air.
2548000	2551000	And you land flat on your back, sprawled out.
2551000	2553000	You can go ahead, Jeff.
2555000	2556000	I want to kill this pig.
2559000	2564000	How does a regular gnome barbarian like me kill a fake construct albino pig?
2566000	2567000	Can I swipe at it again?
2567000	2568000	Can you fly into a berserker rage?
2568000	2569000	Berserk rage.
2569000	2570000	I go into a rage.
2570000	2571000	I fly into a rage.
2572000	2576000	As your eyes turn red, the muscles on your body bulge and ripple.
2577000	2578000	Increase in size.
2579000	2580000	Get a room.
2581000	2584000	You lose all capacity to listen to logic and reason.
2584000	2586000	You can only take violent actions.
2586000	2587000	Let's do this thing.
2589000	2590000	You fly at the pig.
2590000	2591000	I'm going to kill a pig.
2591000	2593000	Slashing it across the side with your blade.
2594000	2595000	Give me 20.
2596000	2597000	You got a 17 that's pretty close.
2598000	2600000	You strike the pig on its flank.
2601000	2604000	Its side splits open and several coins fall out.
2604000	2607000	It's still on some of its last legs.
2608000	2609000	It's a piggy bank.
2610000	2611000	I just got that.
2615000	2616000	I just got that.
2617000	2618000	I can't hear logic right now.
2619000	2622000	I say that aloud to...
2623000	2625000	You're talking to a crazy person right now.
2626000	2628000	I'm attacking a pig.
2631000	2633000	Dan, take the quirk out of its belly.
2635000	2636000	Is there a quirk in his belly?
2637000	2638000	I examine the pig.
2639000	2640000	Good job there.
2640000	2641000	You examine the pig.
2641000	2642000	Good Jew.
2642000	2643000	Yeah, good Jew.
2644000	2645000	The enemy of the pig.
2649000	2650000	Here we go.
2652000	2658000	You do notice on its underbelly is a faint line indicating maybe some sort of seam.
2659000	2660000	Come on.
2660000	2661000	It's a piggy bank.
2661000	2662000	Yeah.
2662000	2663000	We're fighting a piggy bank?
2665000	2669000	Is there a little hammer I can get a hold of?
2670000	2671000	Crack it?
2671000	2673000	You can see some large Lorox lying on the ground.
2674000	2679000	I shout out to my non-logical, hateful friend.
2681000	2682000	The belly!
2683000	2685000	There's a seam on its belly!
2687000	2688000	Target the belly!
2689000	2692000	Your shout rings out and he barely can manage to register it.
2692000	2694000	You're not sure if he understood your full meaning.
2699000	2700000	Okay!
2703000	2706000	I grab a rock and I attack the pig's belly with a rock.
2706000	2709000	You grab a sizable boulder and smash it into the side of the pig.
2710000	2711000	It shatters into pieces.
2711000	2712000	Sweet.
2712000	2713000	It's full of treasure.
2713000	2714000	The whole pig?
2714000	2716000	The whole pig is destroyed.
2716000	2717000	We beat the giant piggy bank.
2718000	2719000	We beat a piggy bank!
2724000	2725000	We beat a piggy bank?
2726000	2727000	That whole thing was a piggy bank?
2727000	2730000	Beating with giant piggy bank was made by...
2730000	2731000	Yeah, that was...
2731000	2732000	Is that a metaphor for something?
2734000	2736000	It's for your destroyed innocence as adventurers.
2737000	2739000	I just made that up right this second.
2742000	2745000	Let's collect this treasure and wrap this segment up.
2746000	2749000	You count 3,500 gold pieces in coins.
2750000	2751000	Jesus Christ!
2751000	2754000	A few gems were recovered, but you don't know their true value.
2755000	2757000	You see a large...
2757000	2759000	No, a small jade statue of a lion.
2760000	2762000	It seems to be glowing softly.
2762000	2763000	It looks rather heavy.
2764000	2765000	As well as a box.
2767000	2768000	A wooden box.
2769000	2772000	Let's put that jade lion in the box.
2773000	2774000	Get the fuck out of here.
2774000	2776000	The lion does not fit in the box.
2776000	2777000	You don't fit in the box.
2777000	2778000	Don't be defensive.
2778000	2780000	Calm down for a certain range.
2780000	2781000	Shut the fuck up.
2781000	2782000	I'm still...
2782000	2783000	Stop trying to do logical things.
2783000	2784000	My eyes are still red.
2784000	2785000	I'm sorry.
2785000	2786000	You're starting to calm down.
2786000	2787000	Oh, okay.
2787000	2788000	Jesus.
2788000	2789000	Take it easy.
2789000	2791000	For future reference, don't just open boxes we find in treasure piles.
2793000	2794000	Or do.
2794000	2795000	Open that box.
2795000	2796000	Or don't.
2796000	2797000	I'm going to open that box.
2797000	2798000	I'm still illogical.
2798000	2799000	I open the box.
2799000	2801000	It's full of scrolls.
2801000	2802000	You don't understand.
2804000	2805000	Those are mine.
2806000	2809000	That's obviously literati stuff.
2809000	2816000	Using your wizard eyes, you can tell that there are two scrolls of magic missile and two scrolls of burning hands.
2816000	2817000	Nice.
2817000	2818000	I'll take them.
2818000	2821000	You also see a large gold sword.
2822000	2824000	I'll be having that sword.
2825000	2828000	As you reach through the sword, you notice a warmth in the grip.
2828000	2831000	You hold it aloft and it emanates bright light.
2833000	2835000	We're talking about jerking off, right?
2837000	2839000	What's going on over there, cork?
2839000	2841000	I'm just grabbing a warm sword handle.
2844000	2846000	Why is it warm?
2846000	2847000	I don't know.
2847000	2848000	You tell me.
2848000	2851000	Is it just warm as he grabs it or is it...
2851000	2852000	It's magic.
2852000	2853000	It's just generally warm.
2853000	2856000	Can I investigate the sword?
2856000	2858000	You investigate the sword.
2858000	2864000	Its blade is a bronzy gold color and it has runes that you don't understand etched into them.
2864000	2867000	The handle is bound in green leather.
2867000	2868000	Alright, here's my vote.
2868000	2871000	We gather all this shit up the best we can.
2871000	2872000	Take five.
2872000	2874000	Yeah, take it back to town.
2874000	2878000	We make Spencer do the grunt work of adding this stuff to our inventory.
2878000	2879000	Fantastic.
2879000	2881000	We analyze it in another installment.
2881000	2883000	Look, a full day's work.
2883000	2884000	We crossed a bridge.
2884000	2887000	Another day, another 3,500 gold pieces.
2889000	2891000	We killed the giant piggy bank.
2891000	2893000	Spencer, everybody. Spencer!
2901000	2903000	Alright, quick, Greg.
2903000	2907000	Let's go to our Dungeons and Dragons segment, Judge Greg.
2907000	2908000	Our man on the street.
2908000	2912000	And see how that compared to his vast compendium.
2915000	2916000	Greg, what'd you think?
2916000	2917000	That was really good.
2917000	2919000	I give Spencer props.
2919000	2921000	It must be really hard.
2921000	2926000	The whole time I was looking over him and just wondering like how he could not freak out.
2926000	2927000	Alright.
2933000	2934000	It seemed like props.
2934000	2940000	Then again, in my early stand-up days, when you wanted to fuck somebody over, if you were MC, you would come up after them and go,
2940000	2942000	Keep it going, folks. Comedy isn't easy.
2946000	2948000	But I don't think that was the spirit in which that was offered.
2948000	2949000	You liked it, right?
2949000	2950000	We kept it short?
2950000	2951000	That was sincere.
2951000	2953000	Do you have any advice for us?
2953000	2955000	Like things to do or not do next time?
2958000	2959000	No, I...
2959000	2960000	Sorry, I got nothing.
2960000	2961000	You were thrilled.
2961000	2962000	I'm thrilled.
2962000	2963000	You were entertained.
2963000	2964000	You're fantastic.
2964000	2965000	We did it.
2965000	2966000	We had a good...
2966000	2968000	Anybody else out there have any questions?
2968000	2969000	Yes, ma'am, right there?
2969000	2971000	Examine before you fight.
2973000	2975000	A young lady in the crowd says,
2975000	2976000	Examine before you fight.
2976000	2978000	Look, I'm a barbarian gnome.
2979000	2984000	If I examined before I fought, you know, I'd be taller.
2984000	2985000	Alright.
2985000	2986000	That's good advice.
2986000	2987000	What's your name, ma'am?
2987000	2988000	Jen.
2988000	2989000	Jen says, Examine before you fight.
2989000	2992000	Let's try to hear her ethereal voice next time we enter a battle.
2992000	2993000	Examine...
2993000	2995000	You should always examine before you fight, gentlemen.
2995000	3000000	I will say, in my defense, Jen, I didn't know we were in a battle
3000000	3005000	until my friend charged across the bridge and attacked the pig.
3006000	3010000	When I see a pig, I don't think time to fight.
3010000	3014000	I think time for breakfast or a delightful Disney conversation.
3014000	3016000	The last thing I thought was that we were going to be fighting it.
3016000	3018000	I sent him across the bridge to test it
3018000	3020000	because he's lighter.
3020000	3021000	Right.
3021000	3022000	I win, Jeff.
3022000	3023000	Alright.
3023000	3024000	You blame me?
3024000	3025000	Yeah.
3025000	3026000	Well, I'll take it.
3026000	3028000	Have you played D&D before?
3028000	3029000	No.
3029000	3030000	No.
3030000	3031000	You do life lessons.
3031000	3033000	This is life lessons.
3033000	3034000	Examine before you fight.
3034000	3035000	Examine?
3035000	3037000	That should be written in Latin on the harmontown flag.
3037000	3039000	Examine before you fight.
3039000	3041000	Pick your battles.
3042000	3043000	Thank you.
3043000	3044000	Thank you very much.
3045000	3048000	I want to hear a little bit about your trip to Chicago.
3048000	3054000	Aaron gave me a couple little nuggets about the clientele at the Hugo Awards.
3054000	3056000	Can I hear a little bit about that?
3056000	3059000	It was very interesting.
3059000	3066000	I'll tell you, the Hugo Awards, both at the pre-reception...
3066000	3068000	Explain to everybody what the Hugo Awards are.
3068000	3069000	Oh, I'm sorry.
3069000	3073000	The Hugo Awards are the science fiction awards,
3073000	3076000	and we were nominated for one for the community episode,
3076000	3079000	Remedial Chaos Theory, which involved multiple timelines
3079000	3082000	and technically qualified as science fiction, I guess,
3082000	3086000	because it asks the question, what if, which is how I would define sci-fi.
3086000	3090000	And we were honored, and Chris McKenna, the writer of the episode,
3090000	3093000	and I went with Chris' brother and my girlfriend, Aaron,
3093000	3096000	to Chicago to go to the Hugo Awards ceremony.
3096000	3099000	And it was amazing to be back in the Midwest
3099000	3102000	and specifically to be back in the Midwest in a science fiction environment,
3102000	3105000	because the body shapes were so...
3105000	3110000	I have been the fattest guy in Los Angeles for a long time.
3110000	3117000	And I was like, from Krypton to Earth.
3117000	3121000	Like, in Rekka, I was like, wow, I am hot.
3121000	3124000	And able-bodied.
3124000	3127000	Lots of rascals, lots of leg braces, lots of scooters,
3127000	3133000	lots of steam-punk tanks to help people breathe.
3133000	3135000	Goggles.
3135000	3139000	Those are called oxygen tanks.
3139000	3141000	Just a lot of gimmicks and things.
3141000	3144000	It was very cool. These are my people, after all,
3144000	3147000	and all of you are here just because we moved to L.A.
3147000	3149000	to try to force our will on the public.
3149000	3152000	It doesn't mean that we're extra sexy or anything,
3152000	3156000	but I like to think that the Harman town people are nerdy people.
3156000	3159000	And so I was definitely home.
3159000	3163000	But it's just very interesting, like the archetypes,
3163000	3166000	like the rotund women who...
3166000	3169000	They want to dress fancy.
3169000	3172000	Nothing is lost on them about the idea of, let's have a big fancy ball,
3172000	3175000	but they all want to do...
3175000	3179000	Well, fancy means Victorian or Dragon times.
3179000	3182000	Everyone's kind of wearing these costumes.
3182000	3184000	Everything's as fancy as they can muster,
3184000	3191000	but without buying into the bullshit black tie paradigm.
3191000	3194000	So when they're walking around, it's like Dr. Demento's
3194000	3200000	walking around getting tea cakes with women dressed like just Aphrodite
3200000	3204000	and no music. Never.
3204000	3209000	From the moment we got there to the moment we left.
3209000	3213000	And we left soon because there was no music,
3213000	3217000	and we weren't like, we're too cool for this.
3217000	3220000	We got there before the award show, we were told,
3220000	3224000	show up two hours before the award show to this reception.
3224000	3227000	So you're in this banquet hall, no music.
3227000	3230000	Everybody totally cool, they're all good people,
3230000	3232000	they're all clearly like...
3232000	3234000	They've all been bullied and they're all very smart
3234000	3238000	and they've all dressed to the relative nines
3238000	3243000	as per their galactic definitions of the nines.
3243000	3247000	They're dressed to the nine Kelvins.
3247000	3250000	So like I said, there's like octopi walking around
3250000	3253000	and that's not true. I don't want to conjure that image.
3253000	3256000	You've all been to Comic Con, where there's a storm chipper.
3256000	3257000	This wasn't like that.
3257000	3260000	This was like an eyes wide shut,
3260000	3265000	kind of like back room at a real sci-fi convention,
3265000	3268000	where you're not allowed to...
3268000	3272000	These are the people that are into sci-fi books
3272000	3277000	and maybe a couple movies if they're really book based.
3277000	3280000	They like the smart stuff.
3280000	3283000	And I think they like fucking.
3283000	3285000	Because there's a lot of cleavage,
3285000	3289000	a lot of just taking your boobs and pouring them into things.
3289000	3291000	Like Renaissance Fair kind of stuff?
3291000	3294000	The Ren Fair, there's lots of bodices and...
3294000	3298000	It felt a little Ren Fairy in the sense that it was like,
3298000	3300000	yeah, let's be fancy tonight.
3300000	3304000	But let's not buy into Hugh Jackman's version of fancy.
3304000	3307000	Did they embrace you? Did they recognize you or know you?
3307000	3309000	We felt, I'm sure everyone felt this way,
3309000	3312000	but we felt very nerdy. We felt outcast.
3312000	3313000	We felt lonely.
3313000	3315000	You were nerdy at the sci-fi?
3315000	3318000	Right, because we were just guys in suits.
3318000	3322000	And so we found a table like you did in high school.
3322000	3325000	And just found a quiet corner and sat.
3325000	3328000	And then some people made the effort to talk to us
3328000	3330000	and then we loosened up a little bit.
3330000	3335000	But we felt very outside and kind of off put.
3335000	3336000	And for good reason.
3336000	3338000	Because I went and we checked in at the convention,
3338000	3339000	the woman that checked us in said,
3339000	3340000	what's your name?
3340000	3341000	And I said, Dan Harmon.
3341000	3343000	She said, oh, community.
3343000	3344000	I love that show, love that episode.
3344000	3345000	I said, oh, thank you very much.
3345000	3349000	She said, you're not going to win.
3349000	3350000	She said, I don't mean any disrespect,
3351000	3353000	but you're up against The Doctor's Wife,
3353000	3355000	written by Neil Gaiman,
3355000	3358000	who is the David Lee Roth of science fiction, apparently.
3361000	3367000	And this episode was the Panama of Neil Gaiman, thanks.
3367000	3369000	There was just no way we were going to win.
3369000	3372000	And she did me the courtesy of letting me know that
3372000	3376000	as I got my name tag, which I appreciate.
3376000	3379000	Was there any rehearsal for your interaction with the show?
3379000	3383000	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3383000	3387000	Yeah, they asked that we show up early.
3387000	3389000	And I've been involved in other award shows,
3389000	3391000	and this has never happened.
3391000	3396000	We had to show up for an orientation in case we won,
3396000	3399000	which just adds to the humiliation of losing.
3399000	3403000	But also it was like a real, it was weird.
3403000	3407000	We walked in and this woman just,
3408000	3411000	she was like five foot, nothing,
3411000	3415000	and she had designed the award.
3415000	3417000	Oh boy, I don't know how to explain this.
3417000	3422000	I want to impart to you guys the misery
3422000	3425000	so that you can turn it into enjoyment.
3425000	3428000	But I don't know how to do it without making you miserable.
3428000	3430000	You walk in and you're in this space
3430000	3433000	and they explain to you how to walk upstairs.
3433000	3436000	And I guess basically everyone there has Asperger's.
3436000	3438000	Every single person.
3438000	3441000	That's what's normal.
3441000	3444000	The attendees or the recipients?
3444000	3445000	Everyone.
3445000	3446000	Every single person.
3446000	3447000	Every security guard.
3447000	3448000	Every bartender.
3448000	3451000	Every woman that's going to hand you a trophy,
3451000	3453000	or the woman that made the trophy,
3453000	3455000	the people voting for the trophies.
3455000	3457000	Everyone in attendance.
3457000	3458000	Everyone has Asperger's.
3458000	3463000	It's just Asperger, Ascon.
3463000	3466000	And so I walked in and they,
3466000	3468000	because they were just like,
3468000	3471000	welcome, as it pertains to the obligatory instructions,
3471000	3472000	will now proceed.
3472000	3477000	You see the stairs are in the center of the stage.
3477000	3480000	If you win, and should you win,
3480000	3482000	I will not presume that you should win.
3482000	3484000	However, the condition that you should win,
3484000	3486000	if it was your ex-organ, I suppose you might win.
3486000	3489000	If you do win, please proceed in an orderly fashion.
3489000	3491000	Up the stairs in the middle of the stage.
3491000	3493000	If you try to go up the left or right stage,
3493000	3495000	you will instantly break your legs,
3495000	3500000	as there are no stairs.
3500000	3501000	So go up the middle.
3501000	3502000	There is an x-mark on the stage
3502000	3504000	where you will pause with the statue.
3504000	3505000	Do not hold the statue.
3505000	3507000	There are glass wings on the statue.
3507000	3508000	Do not hold them like handles,
3508000	3509000	or it will shatter,
3509000	3512000	and that would be a bad thing.
3512000	3515000	Investigate stairs.
3515000	3516000	I investigate the stairs.
3516000	3519000	I examine the stairs.
3519000	3521000	There was a giant pig on the top of the stairs?
3521000	3525000	It was just 40 minutes of people telling you what to do,
3525000	3529000	should someone give you an award.
3529000	3536000	And it turns out what you should do is go up the stairs,
3536000	3542000	take the statue, thank everyone, and leave.
3542000	3545000	That's what you should do, but it was just,
3545000	3548000	they Arthur C. Clarked it, man.
3548000	3551000	There was no music during the awards ceremony?
3551000	3552000	Okay, so back to that.
3552000	3553000	So that was the rehearsal.
3553000	3554000	We had to show up for that.
3554000	3555000	That was the orientation.
3555000	3557000	Then we were ushered to the back of the room
3557000	3560000	where the woman who invented the awards,
3560000	3562000	or designed them for the last three years,
3562000	3564000	she's the genius that put glass wings
3564000	3568000	on the back of a rocket ship that you can't hold them by.
3568000	3570000	So it was another 40 minutes of her explaining
3570000	3574000	don't hold the rocket by the instinctive place
3574000	3576000	where you would hold it if it was handed to you.
3577000	3581000	Instead of an apology, it was just presumption.
3581000	3583000	It was like, hey, fuck you for thinking you should
3583000	3587000	hold this thing in any other way than the prescribed function.
3587000	3590000	I just told you how to mail it back to yourself
3590000	3592000	in a special box if you want it.
3592000	3594000	You did walk out of there thinking two things.
3594000	3597000	Fuck, if I don't win this thing, I'm going to feel like shit.
3597000	3601000	And on the other hand, I just saved myself an asshole to work.
3601000	3603000	She showed you how to polish it.
3603000	3607000	And everyone kept saying, because the statues shaped like a rocket,
3607000	3610000	don't hold it like a dick, because it looks like a dick.
3610000	3612000	No one's just saying the word dick.
3612000	3614000	It looks like a dick.
3614000	3616000	Everyone keeps making jokes about how it looks like a dick,
3616000	3618000	but no one says it looks like a dick.
3618000	3621000	All the women keep going, oh, yeah, they told us not to hold it like this
3621000	3623000	or clean it like this or hold it like this.
3623000	3625000	Yeah, because it looks like a dick.
3625000	3627000	It looks like a big silver dildo.
3627000	3631000	Like, own it or fucking...
3631000	3633000	Or bone it.
3637000	3639000	Yeah, so we got the tutorial about how to clean it.
3639000	3641000	This is a fucking thing that I'll ever see again in my life,
3641000	3644000	but now I know how to clean it and send it out and mail it to myself.
3644000	3646000	So you didn't win.
3646000	3651000	As Aaron pointed out, a simple 3x3 Xerox set of instructions
3651000	3654000	taped to the bottom of the statue would have sufficed, I think.
3654000	3656000	If you want to get a look on the bottom.
3656000	3659000	Oh, here's how I mail this back to L.A.
3659000	3661000	But we went through a lot of that stuff.
3661000	3663000	Then we went to the reception.
3663000	3665000	No music. No fucking music.
3665000	3668000	Was there music when people accepted the award?
3668000	3669000	No.
3669000	3671000	They didn't play them on with the theme from Doctor Who?
3671000	3673000	I'm taking you through this chapter by chapter.
3673000	3676000	There's three chapters to an award show.
3676000	3681000	The reception, the award show itself, and then the post...
3681000	3683000	After party.
3683000	3686000	No music at either of those things at any point.
3686000	3688000	Imagine an award show.
3688000	3690000	First of all, imagine a reception.
3690000	3692000	Where everyone's just eating tea cakes and going like,
3692000	3694000	hey, what are you nominated for? I don't know.
3694000	3696000	No music. You're just standing in a room.
3696000	3697000	Murmur, murmur, murmur, murmur.
3697000	3699000	And then they all go, everyone come in here, come into this room.
3699000	3700000	And then you go to the room.
3700000	3703000	And then they go, it's time for the awards.
3703000	3704000	No, it should have been...
3704000	3705000	Silence.
3705000	3707000	It should have been, it's a dead man's party.
3707000	3708000	Who could I...
3708000	3711000	It should have been, like, the greatest adventure.
3711000	3713000	The lies ahead.
3713000	3716000	Or the theme from Inception or fucking anything.
3716000	3719000	Like, what are nerds better at than fucking like...
3719000	3720000	Soundtracks.
3720000	3721000	You know, yeah.
3721000	3723000	Like, that's what we love.
3723000	3724000	I guess it would maybe...
3724000	3725000	Somebody complained or something.
3725000	3726000	You know what it was?
3726000	3729000	I guarantee you, some Aspergerian person was like,
3729000	3732000	the tech is not good tonight.
3732000	3734000	These speakers are not up to sniff.
3734000	3738000	I will not play my set list with subpar speakers.
3738000	3740000	Good news and bad news.
3743000	3747000	The good news is the sound system is optimized for verbal communication.
3748000	3750000	There will be no pops and whistles.
3750000	3755000	The bad news is, it's basically anti-optimized or de-optimized.
3756000	3757000	For anything other than it.
3757000	3760000	Which happens to include tonight's selection of music,
3760000	3761000	which is provided by Angela.
3761000	3763000	And I wish she was not consulted about this.
3763000	3765000	So I don't know what is happening at this point in time.
3765000	3767000	So I physically don't know what to do.
3769000	3770000	All right, Steven.
3770000	3771000	Well, I guess no music then.
3771000	3773000	Or someone just forgot to play music.
3773000	3774000	Because that happens a lot.
3774000	3777000	I was thinking that somebody complained the previous year.
3777000	3781000	They're like, I don't understand why there's music playing...
3782000	3784000	You know, like some music offended them or something.
3784000	3789000	Your Ben Folds Five seems to be running contrary to my life.
3789000	3791000	It just wasn't logical to play music.
3792000	3793000	And so they just stripped it down.
3793000	3795000	So this award ceremony was just a...
3795000	3798000	Like the trophy itself was just a silver dildo.
3798000	3802000	Just a finely shaped thing that could just impale you.
3802000	3805000	Did anybody make any silver dildo jokes?
3805000	3806000	Or was it...
3806000	3809000	Well, only before and after the show.
3809000	3810000	Not during the show.
3810000	3811000	Nobody...
3811000	3812000	Here's what everyone did.
3812000	3815000	Because everyone had been instructed as if we were about how to hold the trophy
3815000	3816000	and how to handle it.
3816000	3819000	And to not make it look like a dick when you held it.
3819000	3825000	So every single person who won an award accepted it from the woman who hands you the award.
3825000	3830000	And then looked at it like a soiled baby and handed it off to someone else.
3830000	3831000	They're really weird.
3831000	3834000	Are you happy you went or would you rather have not gone?
3834000	3835000	I'm very happy I went.
3835000	3841000	I got 20 minutes of me being a big fucking asshole bully out of my podcast.
3842000	3844000	No, I was happy I went.
3844000	3846000	Like I said, I was honored to be there.
3846000	3852000	As I've said, it was my big chance to lose to Dr. Who instead of Big Bang Theory for a change.
3856000	3857000	You know, that's nice.
3857000	3858000	That feels good.
3858000	3861000	To write a sitcom that gets nominated for a sci-fi award.
3861000	3864000	I'm doing something right slash wrong.
3864000	3865000	I wanted to be there for that.
3865000	3868000	You've got two TV deals with two different networks coming up.
3868000	3870000	Thank you.
3870000	3871000	What is it?
3871000	3874000	CBS and Fox, right?
3874000	3875000	Yes, thank you.
3876000	3878000	Those probably aren't going to be sci-fi shows.
3878000	3885000	Do you think you could write a sci-fi show that would compete with the likes of Dr. Who and things like that?
3885000	3886000	Do you think you could do it?
3886000	3887000	I don't know.
3887000	3892000	I think probably because TV's big secret is all you have to do is write a good pilot.
3892000	3899000	You hire a bunch of really talented people and you just farm their sadness.
3900000	3906000	I don't think there's anything that's impossible in TV because it's the Henry Ford principle.
3906000	3908000	Do you think it's possible to make a jet pack?
3908000	3909000	Yeah.
3909000	3916000	If you put enough Korean people in a warehouse and starve them to death, yeah.
3916000	3920000	If you murder enough people, you know, if you...
3920000	3922000	That's the Henry Ford thing?
3923000	3924000	Yeah.
3924000	3928000	If you chain enough human life together and make each person do one small thing, like, yeah.
3928000	3929000	You could do anything.
3929000	3934000	You're saying you could write a sci-fi show if you put enough Korean people in a warehouse?
3934000	3935000	Yes, yes.
3935000	3940000	That's my promise to you tonight on this election eve.
3942000	3943000	sponsored by Nike.
3943000	3946000	Wasn't it Archimedes who said, give me enough Korean people?
3946000	3947000	Give me enough Koreans in a warehouse.
3947000	3951000	Give me 100 Koreans in one warehouse and I can write you a...
3951000	3953000	And I will give you a hit UPN show.
3959000	3960000	If you could write...
3960000	3964000	Off the top of your head, if you could write a sci-fi show, what would the premise be?
3965000	3966000	Well, I would either do it...
3966000	3969000	My first answer would be time travel in general.
3969000	3970000	I love time travel.
3970000	3971000	I'd love to do a time travel show.
3971000	3972000	Do it.
3972000	3973000	Fuck you, lady.
3975000	3977000	No, that's the investigate before you fight me.
3977000	3978000	Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
3978000	3981000	Yeah, hey, examine before you yell out, do it.
3981000	3988000	Now, what she really meant, that was a reverse heckle.
3988000	3989000	That was a high road heckle.
3989000	3990000	She was like, do it.
3990000	3991000	Get off stage.
3992000	3994000	Go write something.
3995000	3996000	That's why...
3996000	3997000	Get us out of here.
3998000	3999000	I agree with you.
4000000	4003000	Time travel, I'd love to do.
4003000	4005000	Why time travel particularly?
4005000	4006000	I don't know.
4006000	4007000	I just think that's...
4007000	4010000	What's the wish fulfillment in time travel?
4011000	4013000	Because there must be, right?
4013000	4015000	Well, no, I don't...
4016000	4017000	I don't know.
4017000	4019000	What's the fetish of time travel for you?
4019000	4021000	Well, no, because you would say...
4021000	4022000	No, I think...
4022000	4024000	Well, okay, yeah, yeah, empowerment.
4024000	4025000	That's what it is.
4025000	4028000	Because if I could be...
4028000	4029000	If I could go to any time...
4029000	4039000	I was fantasized about if my whole garage with all of the stuff that was in my Prius got transported to 1920,
4039000	4041000	then not only I'd be like...
4041000	4044000	I could be like Batman, because I'd have a Prius.
4044000	4046000	What do you have on that Prius?
4046000	4049000	I'd just be competing with, like, Machine Gun Kelly.
4049000	4051000	He'd have, like, this shitty old car.
4051000	4053000	And a machine gun.
4054000	4055000	He'd still kill you.
4055000	4056000	I know, I know.
4056000	4058000	I didn't think my fantasy threw a job.
4058000	4060000	Because I also go like, oh, yeah, I don't have GPS.
4060000	4061000	No, I wouldn't.
4061000	4063000	The satellites wouldn't be there.
4064000	4066000	But I just think that's a cool idea that...
4066000	4067000	Your Prius, yeah.
4067000	4068000	It wouldn't have the right octane.
4068000	4070000	You're not just a normal guy in 1920s Chicago.
4070000	4071000	I think that would be cool.
4071000	4072000	If you were like...
4072000	4074000	You had to dress up in a suit.
4075000	4076000	I don't know.
4076000	4077000	Yeah, wish fulfillment.
4077000	4078000	That's everybody's...
4078000	4080000	Yeah, everyone has a time that they'd like to go to.
4080000	4082000	We all have the fantasy of going back, like, oh, fuck.
4082000	4083000	What if I was like...
4083000	4087000	If I knew what I knew now, I could go back to junior high school.
4087000	4088000	I'd be the coolest guy in the world.
4088000	4091000	But still, I would still be bad at math.
4091000	4093000	I couldn't save anybody's life.
4093000	4094000	I'd be bad at all the fucking math.
4094000	4096000	Also, you'd be the biggest loser in the world.
4096000	4099000	You would be more honest with girls.
4099000	4101000	You would be a bigger loser.
4101000	4103000	There would be a couple things that you would nail
4103000	4105000	and then everything else would fall apart
4105000	4107000	that ever went together for you.
4107000	4108000	There's your movie.
4108000	4110000	Well, I think that was called Happy Gilmore.
4111000	4113000	Or wait, no, what was the other one?
4113000	4114000	Happy Madison?
4114000	4115000	Billy Gilmore?
4115000	4116000	Billy Madison?
4117000	4119000	I think Adam Sandler was in it.
4120000	4123000	He went back to school and he went with his jean jacket
4123000	4124000	and his ACDC music,
4124000	4127000	and he found out that you actually wouldn't be cool in high school.
4127000	4128000	Oh, yeah, I never saw that.
4128000	4130000	Yeah, because high school is its own culture.
4130000	4134000	It's not based on any actual empirical thinking.
4134000	4138000	It's based on the hormonal and in-the-moment thing
4138000	4140000	of a bunch of young people.
4140000	4141000	They're right and we're wrong.
4141000	4144000	So, Greg, how's Dan doing right now as a podcast?
4146000	4149000	I have the feeling you're looking for a way to end your podcast.
4149000	4150000	Yeah.
4154000	4155000	He's right.
4157000	4159000	A better comptroller would have ended the show right there,
4159000	4161000	but I'm not going to do it.
4161000	4162000	Oh, all right.
4163000	4164000	All right.
4164000	4165000	Let's figure this out.
4169000	4170000	Anybody have a question?
4170000	4171000	Anybody like to...
4171000	4172000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4172000	4173000	Raise your hand.
4173000	4174000	Okay, there.
4174000	4175000	Shout it out.
4177000	4178000	Nike sponsorship.
4178000	4180000	He's calling out for a call back to the Nike sponsorship.
4180000	4182000	Yeah, well, he's talking about...
4182000	4183000	What's your name back there?
4183000	4184000	Daniel.
4184000	4186000	Daniel asks what happened to our Nike sponsorship thing.
4186000	4189000	I think we have to figure out how to do that.
4189000	4192000	We were trying to strong arm Nike into giving us money,
4192000	4196000	or actually any sponsor, by saying that Nike were terrible people
4196000	4198000	and then promoting Adidas.
4198000	4200000	Yeah, we should probably hit that real quick.
4201000	4204000	Everybody buy Nike because you're racist.
4205000	4207000	Yes, Nike.
4207000	4212000	The delicious shoe for the foot of the Aryan nation.
4217000	4219000	You know, Dan, while you were talking about Nike
4219000	4220000	and their overt racism,
4220000	4223000	I was thinking about how comfortable I am tonight
4223000	4225000	in my Adidas.
4228000	4231000	It's a new shoe called the Adidas made by Puma.
4232000	4234000	It's the new Puma Adidas.
4235000	4236000	We can't fucking do this, right?
4236000	4238000	We need a sponsor is what we're saying.
4238000	4239000	Someone's all...
4239000	4240000	We got all tangled up.
4240000	4244000	The answer to your question, Daniel, is we fucked up.
4244000	4246000	We tangled in forces.
4246000	4250000	We tried strong arm Nike, but Nike doesn't give a shit.
4250000	4253000	We tried to out avenue Madison Avenue.
4253000	4254000	Yeah.
4254000	4255000	We tried to out avenue an avenue.
4255000	4256000	Yeah.
4256000	4257000	It's impossible.
4257000	4258000	They're already an avenue.
4258000	4259000	I don't care.
4260000	4262000	I tried to stab a piggy bank earlier.
4262000	4264000	We don't fucking know what we're doing.
4265000	4267000	Welcome to failure.
4268000	4269000	Any other questions?
4269000	4271000	Anybody have a question for Dan Harmon right here, sir?
4271000	4272000	Yes.
4272000	4274000	Is kettle one your drink of choice
4274000	4276000	or is that just for bulk drinking?
4276000	4277000	Is kettle one your drink of choice
4277000	4279000	or is it just for bulk drinking?
4279000	4281000	It's my drink of choice.
4281000	4283000	Therefore, I drink it in bulk.
4285000	4286000	Why kettle one?
4286000	4288000	You can sense everyone's excited.
4288000	4289000	They're like...
4289000	4290000	Yeah.
4290000	4291000	This is an ending.
4291000	4292000	It's like that.
4293000	4294000	You guys want to help.
4294000	4296000	You're like, and it's a closer.
4296000	4299000	I used to go body boarding when I was in high school
4299000	4302000	and you would be out in the ocean
4302000	4305000	and you get so tired and sometimes a wave would kick your ass
4305000	4306000	and you'd almost drown.
4306000	4309000	It's just gonna be one good wave to take me back into the beach.
4309000	4312000	I'll get on its side.
4313000	4314000	It doesn't have to be great.
4315000	4318000	I'll still say cowabunga no matter what, you know.
4318000	4319000	I'm gonna roll until ball.
4319000	4321000	Just get me back to the beach safely.
4321000	4323000	You know Dino's daughter got stung by a stingray.
4323000	4324000	Yeah.
4324000	4326000	Dino Stamotopoulos' daughter got stung by a stingray.
4326000	4328000	The same animal that killed the...
4328000	4329000	See, Verwin.
4329000	4330000	See, Verwin.
4330000	4332000	Yeah, if it stings you right, it'll fucking kill you.
4332000	4333000	Even if you're an alligator wrestler.
4333000	4334000	And by all accounts,
4334000	4337000	it's bloody fucking painful to get stung by a stingray.
4337000	4339000	And she's been stung by a jellyfish
4339000	4341000	and she got her finger grounded like a meat grinder
4341000	4343000	on a field trip.
4343000	4346000	And the same week that she got stung by a stingray,
4346000	4349000	our friend's daughter, who was what, 12, 13, 14?
4349000	4350000	What is she?
4350000	4351000	Someone around that, right?
4351000	4353000	Around 12 years old?
4353000	4354000	Come on, Dan, help me out.
4354000	4355000	Wait, who are you talking about?
4355000	4356000	What are you talking about?
4356000	4357000	Tigger.
4357000	4358000	Right.
4358000	4359000	Our friend's daughter.
4359000	4360000	How old is she?
4360000	4361000	Oh, 12, 13.
4361000	4362000	Yeah, I don't know.
4365000	4366000	I can't wait to hear the recording.
4366000	4367000	Who is it?
4367000	4368000	I'm like, what?
4368000	4369000	What do you...
4369000	4370000	Yeah, she's 12, 13.
4370000	4371000	I don't know.
4371000	4372000	The same week that she got stung by a stingray
4372000	4374000	and screamed bloody murder and it's very painful.
4374000	4376000	She also dove into a pole and then a flip
4376000	4377000	and scraped her face off.
4377000	4378000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4378000	4379000	And got in a car accident.
4379000	4381000	They were backing out and something like that.
4381000	4384000	They were parked and somebody side swiped them
4384000	4386000	and her and her mom got whiplash.
4386000	4387000	Same week.
4387000	4388000	She's marked for death.
4388000	4391000	She's like the Final Destination.
4391000	4392000	Final Destination.
4392000	4393000	Thank you, ma'am.
4393000	4394000	Final Destination.
4394000	4395000	That's exactly what I was thinking of,
4395000	4396000	the Final Destination movie.
4396000	4398000	Which, by the way, are surprisingly good.
4398000	4400000	You would never think on paper.
4400000	4403000	Applause, yes, for the...
4403000	4405000	In a post, Freddy Krueger, Jason...
4405000	4407000	We went too far with the...
4407000	4408000	Who's next?
4408000	4411000	He's got forks for toes.
4411000	4412000	His name's Steven.
4412000	4414000	Like, we kept trying to come up with an understated...
4414000	4418000	Well, Jason, Freddy, Mark, Kyle.
4418000	4419000	Douglas.
4419000	4420000	Douglas.
4420000	4421000	Douglas loves fire.
4421000	4424000	He's got fire feet.
4424000	4426000	Obviously, that had to give.
4426000	4428000	And Final Destination is pretty...
4428000	4430000	On paper, you go, like, oh, these kids...
4430000	4432000	You know, in the beginning of each of these movies,
4432000	4433000	they go, ah, we're kids.
4433000	4434000	We love having sex.
4434000	4436000	Let's get on the roller coaster.
4436000	4437000	And then someone goes, like, wait.
4437000	4438000	I gotta tie my shoe.
4438000	4440000	Don't get on the roller coaster.
4440000	4441000	And then they don't get on it.
4441000	4444000	And then they, let's take pictures of each other.
4444000	4449000	So we can rip off the Damien thing.
4449000	4452000	And then they...
4452000	4455000	So then the roller coaster, like, crashes.
4455000	4457000	Big 9-11 thing happens.
4458000	4461000	But then one kid goes, looking at the pictures,
4461000	4464000	and goes, like, whoa, all your faces are, like, fucked up.
4464000	4466000	Or there's a shadow of a thing.
4466000	4468000	Like, we were supposed to die on that roller coaster.
4468000	4470000	And now everyone who's...
4470000	4473000	The whole movie is every kid who's supposed to die on the thing
4473000	4475000	gets killed by, like, a nail gun,
4475000	4478000	or their dad closes a garage door in their head.
4478000	4484000	Welcome to your Grandpa Reviews movies.
4484000	4486000	Don't, no, I have more to say.
4486000	4487000	Don't force that ending.
4487000	4488000	Don't die.
4488000	4489000	You say he almost...
4489000	4490000	Fuck you.
4490000	4492000	I had my finger on the trigger, and yet...
4492000	4496000	I think you can do better, and I think they deserve worse.
4500000	4502000	No, this is the final destination.
4502000	4504000	We're not accepting charity, brother.
4504000	4507000	No, we're gonna be here for fucking three more hours.
4507000	4509000	Yeah, we're gonna start breakfast, too.
4509000	4511000	I'm just saying those are surprisingly good movies.
4511000	4512000	I think I caught, like, two and five.
4512000	4513000	I don't know.
4513000	4514000	I've never seen them.
4514000	4515000	They're pretty good, man.
4515000	4517000	Have you heard about or seen this movie, Martyrs?
4517000	4519000	Has anybody seen that piece of shit?
4519000	4520000	One person backstage.
4520000	4521000	All right, anybody out there?
4521000	4523000	There's two Martyrs out there?
4523000	4524000	Martyrs.
4524000	4525000	Martyrs?
4525000	4526000	Martyrs.
4526000	4527000	Like a Martyr.
4527000	4528000	I thought it was about, like, loose leaf...
4528000	4529000	No.
4529000	4530000	This is true.
4530000	4531000	This is 3.5 inches.
4531000	4532000	My advice...
4532000	4533000	Is it French, right?
4533000	4534000	The director?
4534000	4535000	Is it French?
4535000	4537000	My advice to you is don't see it.
4537000	4538000	Do not see it.
4538000	4541000	Unless you like misogynistic French directors
4541000	4543000	beating women for fucking 13 years
4543000	4545000	and then ending on a kind of like,
4545000	4547000	like, oops, we did it.
4547000	4549000	That's the movie.
4549000	4551000	Somebody fucking gave me that movie.
4551000	4553000	A bartender at the fucking drawing room gave me that movie.
4553000	4554000	Like, Jeff, you like weird movies.
4554000	4555000	Watch Martyrs.
4555000	4556000	It's crazy.
4556000	4557000	Get to the end.
4557000	4558000	I watched it.
4558000	4559000	Halfway through, I texted her.
4559000	4560000	I was like, I hate you.
4560000	4562000	And I hate everyone you know.
4562000	4563000	And I hate this movie.
4563000	4566000	And if I ever see you, I'm gonna do to you
4566000	4567000	what this movie did to me.
4567000	4569000	And I'm going to beat you and tie you
4569000	4570000	and feed you pea soup
4570000	4572000	and beat you to death like the fucking women
4572000	4575000	that do it and skin you alive and then have no ending.
4575000	4576000	And then I watched the ending.
4576000	4578000	I'm like, okay, it's a pretty good ending.
4578000	4579000	But don't watch the movie.
4579000	4581000	Don't fucking watch Martyrs.
4581000	4584000	Well, Jeff, when you watch the DVD,
4584000	4586000	they gave me the DVD that you can't fucking,
4586000	4587000	it's not in stores.
4587000	4588000	It's not, you can't go to your fucking,
4588000	4589000	it's not on Netflix.
4589000	4591000	And there's a good reason because it's fucking,
4591000	4593000	it's an atrocity.
4593000	4594000	And I watched the movie.
4594000	4596000	And I've never seen a movie,
4596000	4599000	the DVD options are play movie,
4599000	4604000	subtitles, audio options.
4604000	4606000	One of them was play movie,
4606000	4610000	play movie with director introduction.
4610000	4611000	That's, I've never seen that.
4611000	4613000	And there's a little kind of chubby French guy
4613000	4617000	goes like, he's standing by like his collection of DVDs.
4617000	4618000	There's like, you know,
4618000	4620000	like everything that Quentin Tarantino did.
4620000	4622000	And you know, like, he's like,
4622000	4625000	I'm sorry that you have to watch this movie.
4626000	4629000	If you went online and watched,
4629000	4632000	watched the scenes, the reviews on the internet,
4632000	4634000	I wish you had not,
4634000	4635000	I wish you come in as a virgin
4635000	4638000	and do not watch the, come in just open.
4638000	4641000	I feel, I'm sorry for what I made.
4641000	4644000	He spends 10 minutes apologizing for his movie.
4644000	4646000	I'm glad I watched that because if I didn't,
4646000	4647000	I would never have watched it.
4647000	4651000	If I see him, I'm still gonna kick him in the dick.
4651000	4652000	Don't watch Martyrs.
4652000	4653000	But you.
4653000	4655000	Well, Jeff, I'm glad that this came up.
4655000	4659000	And in fact, I knew it would because tonight has been
4659000	4663000	a labyrinthine manipulation to get it to come up
4663000	4666000	because the director of Martyrs
4666000	4668000	is actually here in the front row.
4668000	4669000	Here he comes.
4673000	4674000	What's wrong?
4674000	4675000	What's the problem?
4675000	4679000	I already apologized in the thing.
4679000	4681000	I just feel like you hate women.
4681000	4682000	I love women.
4682000	4685000	Well, yeah, how come only women get beaten up
4685000	4686000	and the men never do?
4686000	4687000	Because they are there.
4687000	4689000	Why climb Mount Everest?
4689000	4691000	The beautiful women,
4691000	4698000	their ability to be beaten is an expression
4698000	4700000	of postmodern alphabet.
4702000	4703000	Postmodern alphabet?
4703000	4706000	What would a postmodern alphabet be?
4706000	4708000	It'd be like a woman.
4708000	4710000	It'd be like the figure eight, the violin,
4710000	4712000	the curves, the femininity,
4712000	4715000	all the beautiful, punchable parts.
4715000	4720000	Now, I feel like because it's only women being tortured,
4720000	4723000	brutalized, and beaten to death,
4723000	4726000	to the point of like within an inch of their life
4726000	4728000	and actually to death,
4728000	4731000	the fact that you made the bad guy a woman
4731000	4732000	seems like an apology.
4732000	4734000	That seems like you're just trying to get away with misogyny
4734000	4739000	by making the over, like the main bad guy also a woman.
4741000	4742000	Touche.
4745000	4747000	End it, end the show.
4747000	4749000	Point at me and yell it.
4749000	4750000	Point at me and yell it, Dan, do it.
4750000	4751000	Do it.
4751000	4752000	Point at me and yell it.
4752000	4753000	He should have ended the show.
4753000	4754000	I'll do it.
4754000	4755000	I'll do it.
4755000	4756000	I'll do it.
4756000	4757000	No, no, it's too late.
4757000	4758000	It's too late.
4758000	4761000	No, I want you to beg for it, you piece of shit.
4762000	4764000	You're like a woman strapped to a chair,
4764000	4766000	forced to poop in a bucket.
4766000	4768000	You're marching yourself right now.
4768000	4771000	I want you to look on your face when you die.
4771000	4775000	I'm Barof on the Masters, the Eli Roth, the Sam Peckinpah.
4775000	4777000	Oh, Sam Peckinpah.
4777000	4780000	Again, anybody see Sam Peckinpah films?
4780000	4782000	No, that's zero.
4782000	4785000	Welcome to the fucking Thunderdome.
4785000	4787000	Sam Peckinpah, known as a great director.
4787000	4789000	However, in every fucking movie he made
4789000	4792000	and enjoyed, rape is justified.
4792000	4794000	A case for rape.
4794000	4796000	Yeah, not just justified, but women fucking like,
4796000	4801000	no, no, uh, maybe, yes, oh, oh, my hero.
4801000	4802000	Oh, now that it's done.
4802000	4803000	Fucking boo.
4803000	4805000	That guy is fucking gross.
4805000	4808000	Sam Peckinpah, yeah, Wild Bunch is a good movie,
4808000	4811000	but still, fucking that guy, creepy.
4811000	4812000	How about this?
4812000	4814000	Gentlemen, there are many...
4814000	4816000	There's got to be a way to guarantee a closer.
4816000	4817000	There are men in the audience...
4818000	4819000	Let's have a costume contest.
4819000	4820000	Costume contest?
4820000	4821000	Yeah.
4821000	4822000	On a podcast?
4822000	4823000	Yeah.
4823000	4824000	All right, let's do it.
4824000	4825000	No, no, no, that's a bad idea.
4825000	4826000	Let's do it.
4826000	4828000	Yeah, I would say, if you're a gentleman out there
4828000	4831000	that's a writer, TV, screenwriter, films...
4831000	4833000	Come up and knock my hat off.
4833000	4837000	What's your idea?
4837000	4842000	Zach, back here, our tech guy, wants you to rap.
4842000	4843000	Rap up the show.
4843000	4845000	Well, rap up the show.
4845000	4850000	Well, rap like an art form, like a Nelly, someone called me.
4850000	4852000	How about this, Dan?
4852000	4856000	Let's see if I can pull this off here.
4856000	4861000	I'm going to pull up Johnny Cash.
4861000	4865000	We're going to do a Johnny Cash thing.
4865000	4867000	Think about summing up the show right now.
4867000	4870000	Here's an interesting topic.
4870000	4874000	I bet you could break this room into two groups of people.
4874000	4878000	People who keep listening to different songs.
4878000	4880000	I'm in the other group.
4880000	4882000	Do you land on a song?
4882000	4885000	Do you just wear it out?
4885000	4887000	Put it on a loop and you're just like,
4887000	4889000	fucking, oh, it's not a local song.
4889000	4891000	And you get a little embarrassed about it.
4891000	4893000	I remember when I was a kid, my dad,
4893000	4896000	because we're right now, just to equate myself with this,
4896000	4898000	because we were playing Rockstar,
4898000	4900000	that song by the Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,
4900000	4903000	they're like, wait, they don't love you like I love you.
4903000	4905000	Wait, they don't love you.
4905000	4907000	I fucking love that song so much.
4907000	4910000	I just keep playing it, playing it, playing it over and over.
4910000	4914000	And I remember my dad, when my parents separated,
4914000	4918000	he kept playing Turnaround Bright Eyes.
4918000	4919000	Total Eclipse of the Heart.
4919000	4920000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4920000	4922000	Total Eclipse of the Heart, yeah.
4922000	4924000	Parentheses, Turnaround Bright Eyes.
4924000	4927000	I remember being in my room, like 10 years old,
4927000	4930000	and hearing that song on a boombox in my kitchen,
4930000	4933000	living alone in a house with my dad.
4933000	4937000	And just hearing that song just kept playing over and over again.
4937000	4939000	And I couldn't leave the house.
4939000	4941000	I wanted to go play, at that point,
4941000	4943000	finally willing to play baseball.
4943000	4945000	I would do anything to get out of my room,
4945000	4949000	but I couldn't leave because any path would take me past my father,
4949000	4954000	who I could hear was playing Eclipse of the Heart on a loop.
4954000	4955000	It was really weird.
4955000	4960000	Are you saying the house was like a powder keg and giving it off sparks?
4960000	4961000	Wait, what?
4961000	4962000	I don't know.
4962000	4964000	I really need you tonight.
4964000	4965000	Oh, yeah.
4965000	4967000	Yeah, I blocked it out.
4967000	4970000	I don't know, but it kept playing.
4970000	4971000	Come on, Harmon.
4971000	4972000	Which one is this?
4972000	4975000	I'm sorry this show was bad.
4975000	4977000	I'm sorry it went bad.
4977000	4979000	I'm sorry it got slower.
4979000	4982000	And that you rhymed bad with bad?
4983000	4988000	Thank you, Jeff Comptroller, for signing with negativity.
4991000	4994000	I guarantee this won't be a closer.
4994000	4997000	Because it's impossible to rhyme with negativity.
4999000	5000000	Nativity.
5005000	5006000	Good night, everybody.
5006000	5007000	We fucking did it.
5007000	5013000	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town once again.
5013000	5014000	No.
5015000	5016000	No.
5016000	5017000	All right.
5017000	5018000	No.
5019000	5020000	No.
5023000	5024000	No.
5024000	5025000	I knew you were going to say that.
5025000	5027000	I knew you were going to say that.
5027000	5029000	There will be a real closer.
5034000	5036000	It'll be genuine.
5038000	5039000	I'm defiant.
5039000	5040000	I was going to end that motherfucker.
5040000	5041000	I know.
5041000	5042000	It doesn't matter.
5042000	5043000	You can end on anything.
5043000	5046000	These people have all been at things that have ended badly.
5046000	5047000	I don't accept that ending.
5047000	5049000	There's got to be a new way.
5054000	5055000	Fuck.
5055000	5056000	All right.
5056000	5057000	Okay.
5057000	5058000	All right.
5058000	5059000	There's no way out.
5059000	5060000	All right.
5060000	5061000	You're on your own.
5061000	5062000	There's got to be a way out.
5062000	5063000	There's no way out.
5063000	5064000	There's got to be a way out.
5064000	5065000	No, these people are hostages.
5065000	5066000	No, there's a way out.
5066000	5067000	All right.
5067000	5068000	The guy is fucking settling.
5068000	5069000	This is it.
5069000	5070000	All right.
5070000	5071000	You, sir.
5071000	5072000	What's your name?
5072000	5073000	Andy.
5073000	5074000	Andy.
5074000	5075000	Okay.
5075000	5077000	Andy, what's your favorite comfort food?
5077000	5079000	That's tough.
5079000	5081000	That's tough, Andy says.
5081000	5082000	Steak.
5082000	5083000	Okay.
5083000	5084000	Andy likes steak.
5084000	5085000	Okay.
5085000	5086000	All right.
5086000	5087000	All right.
5087000	5088000	What's your name, sir?
5088000	5089000	Jason.
5089000	5090000	Jason.
5090000	5091000	Okay.
5091000	5094000	What is your least favorite food?
5094000	5095000	Seafood.
5095000	5096000	Seafood.
5096000	5097000	Okay.
5097000	5098000	All right.
5098000	5100000	Andy likes steak.
5100000	5102000	Jason hates seafood.
5102000	5108000	And that is the title of the movie I'm About to Improvise.
5108000	5112000	Do you want theme music or you're good?
5112000	5114000	Theme music, please.
5114000	5115000	Obviously.
5115000	5118000	No, hang on.
5118000	5123000	We can do better than that.
5124000	5127000	Sir, something's gone wrong.
5127000	5130000	What is it, Jason?
5130000	5132000	It's the steak.
5132000	5135000	It's threatening all the seafood.
5135000	5140000	Let's get out there and rectify that situation.
5140000	5141000	Yeah.
5141000	5143000	I was coming here to suggest that.
5143000	5147000	I can't go over your head.
5147000	5149000	I wasn't saying that you should.
5149000	5153000	Sir, is there something wrong?
5153000	5154000	Yeah.
5154000	5155000	I get insecure.
5155000	5158000	I feel like I got promoted before you.
5158000	5160000	Don't let that worry you.
5160000	5161000	I've always respected you.
5161000	5164000	I know that.
5164000	5165000	Let's get out there.
5165000	5168000	Get the jeep.
5168000	5176000	The steak jeep.
5176000	5182000	Tom Clancy Chiron, Steak Zone, Sector 7.
5182000	5191000	Incoming seafood.
5191000	5198000	Let's go fuck up some seafood, motherfuckers.
5198000	5202000	Gentlemen, Sector 7 is clear.
5202000	5207000	All in the Steak Zone say, hoo-ah, hoo-ah.
5207000	5210000	I suggest we camp out for the...
5210000	5211000	What was that?
5211000	5212000	I got movement.
5212000	5213000	What?
5213000	5215000	Stand down, Lieutenant.
5215000	5216000	No, sir, I got movement.
5216000	5218000	You will silence yourself.
5218000	5220000	We're going on R&R.
5220000	5222000	Our hubris is primary.
5222000	5224000	We will relax.
5224000	5227000	We will not pay attention to any incoming data.
5227000	5229000	But, sir, I don't...
5229000	5232000	Seafood!
5232000	5233000	Oh, shit!
5233000	5235000	Oh, my fucking asshole!
5235000	5238000	Oh, I'm getting it ripped out of my pussy!
5238000	5240000	Oh, my intestines!
5240000	5241000	Oh, shit!
5241000	5244000	Obamacare, Mitt Romney, hotbuddies,
5244000	5248000	Monica Lewinsky, cigars, got milk.
5248000	5249000	Closer!
5249000	5253000	We did it!
5253000	5254000	Nerd milk.
5254000	5258000	It's been my pleasure to rip the fucking roof off this place!
5258000	5261000	Mic drop!
5261000	5264000	Sorry.
5268000	5272000	Oh, boy, Dan Harmon, everybody.
5274000	5277000	In an unclosable show, he closed it.
5277000	5279000	Keep your applause going if you want,
