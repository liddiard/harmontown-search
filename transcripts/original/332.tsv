80200	82200	I know.
82200	86200	A friend of mine is telling me we were talking about a mutual friend of ours.
86200	88200	And I was like, how's he doing?
88200	90200	Oh, he's good.
90200	94200	Like, you know, we were talking about he's, we're all the same age.
94200	96200	Like, you know, mid-40s.
96200	98200	And this other person's a creative.
98200	102200	And like, I was like, you know, is he self-sufficient?
102200	104200	Can he afford to, what's he doing?
104200	108200	Oh, he's on that one show, but he's also, you know, he's doing this and that.
108200	110200	And I'm like, is it, well, yeah, where's he at?
110200	112200	Like, is he, is he scared of the future?
112200	116200	Or what is he in the, in the, um, I don't know why I'm teeing this up so much.
116200	120200	We were just talking about our friend and his like situation or whatever that wasn't there.
120200	124200	And my friends goes, he goes, you know, and he's got his daughter, his kid's all grown up.
124200	130200	And, um, and, uh, she just got out of Yale and, uh, but I thought he said jail.
131200	136200	But the crazy thing is how long the conversation continued identically.
136200	142200	As I, because it was, I, I was, it's like, he, she just got, she just got out of Yale and, you know,
142200	143200	that's hundreds of thousands of dollars.
143200	145200	I'm like, Oh yeah, of course.
145200	147200	Like, how long was she in?
147200	148200	Four years.
148200	149200	Jesus.
149200	155200	Well, I, like, uh, so I mean, is she, is she even going to be able to get a job?
156200	163200	Uh, these days, it went on and on.
163200	168200	And it was like, until I finally like, was like, is it, was she in jail or prison?
168200	169200	And he's like, what?
172200	173200	Yale.
173200	174200	Oh, okay.
174200	175200	That's kind of funny.
175200	176200	I just make no difference.
176200	177200	No difference at all.
177200	179200	It's just a fucked up situation to be in as a father.
179200	180200	Yes.
180200	182200	She was hanging out with white supremacists.
182200	184200	Again, you can't tell Yale or jail.
185200	187200	Uh, yeah, but he'll be fine.
187200	188200	He's fine.
188200	189200	Yay.
189200	194200	Um, it sounds like, uh, and I had some, I had some, some of that, uh, juicy, juicy rice.
194200	195200	What was that?
195200	196200	What's that stuff Dino makes?
196200	197200	That garlicky rice.
197200	199200	Uh, give it to me.
199200	200200	Yeah.
200200	201200	Give it to me.
201200	202200	What's that?
202200	204200	It's like an Orzo kind of pastilla dish with a tomato kind of sauce.
204200	205200	It's very good.
205200	206200	That sounds pretty good.
206200	207200	Yeah.
207200	208200	I love food now.
208200	210200	You throw a little kefel, kefelotiri or some azitha on that.
210200	211200	You ready to go?
211200	212200	Oh, of course.
212200	223200	I mean, the, uh, uh, the, uh, the, the, the Holmes and Watson, uh, movie with, uh, the
223200	227200	first five minutes is like worth $30.
227200	234700	I was, I was drunk granted, but like, I, I was like, like crying, not just from laughing,
234700	241000	but also like emotion, like, like, like they just, there's this like opening where the,
241000	245880	where it's like the origin of Sherlock Holmes meeting Watson and like, it's, it's, I can't
245880	246880	even remember the details.
246880	248520	I just, I was like shrieking laughing.
248520	249880	Is this the Robert Downey Jr. kind of?
249880	250880	No, no.
250880	251880	This is the Will Ferrell.
251880	252880	Oh, right.
252880	253880	Yeah.
253880	257600	It, it, it, it, then it's just like after, it's like the first five minutes like deserves
257600	263640	an Academy award for like a comedic opening about, about a Sherlock Holmes movie.
263640	267800	It's just like, it's, it's, it's such a great, it promises so much.
267800	269120	I don't know what happened.
269120	270120	Who knows?
270120	271120	Look at the credits.
271120	272120	I don't know.
272120	273120	Is that an Adam McKay movie?
273120	274120	I don't know.
274120	275120	It probably is.
275120	276120	Yeah.
276120	277120	Cause it was the Gary Sanchez title card.
277120	278960	But yeah, I don't know.
278960	282040	I'm such a fan of that, of that circle.
282040	284880	I don't even, I just want to focus on what's good.
284880	285880	I don't want to.
285880	286880	I don't want to.
286880	287880	Did you watch the whole thing?
287880	288880	Yeah.
288880	289880	Well, no, we actually stopped.
289880	295840	I mean, that is really, I, I, I have enough respect for that camp that I assume they will
295840	299800	not be offended, but they must know that that, that something happened there and the
299800	304720	stinker got made, but, but I do, I, I just, I don't want to be a snoot about it.
304720	309360	I just want, I just want to say, holy shit, best first five minutes of a fucking Sherlock
309360	310360	Holmes story ever.
310360	313680	It's, it's so, it's so, if I'm on a plane, I'll just pop that in and watch the cold.
313680	314800	It's so worth it, man.
314800	320560	I would almost almost argue that it's worth like the, whatever it costs on Apple TV, certainly
320560	323960	the rental, rent it for the three 99 or whatever it is.
323960	324960	Maybe don't buy it.
324960	325960	You're a millennial.
325960	327560	You've, you've got enough problems.
327560	333520	Remember Vice's article about how, did you ever see that porn genre?
333520	337600	The what's it called?
337600	339320	Detective the rent is due.
339320	340320	What's it called?
340320	346400	It's like something, a property, property bros or no, it's probably property, something
346400	351880	property sluts or property, sorry, ladies.
351880	352880	Property sex workers.
352880	358000	It's, it's, it's, it's, yeah, property, something, something like that.
358000	362600	But it's like the vice angle on it was millennials have a new genre of porn based on how broke
362600	365440	they are because it's just people.
365440	369440	It's like people either taking advantage of desperate realtors.
369440	373560	It's all fictional of course, or it's like tenants that are getting evicted in it.
373560	378400	It's just sort of like, it's a genre of porn about encroaching poverty.
378400	382800	Lame is porn.
382800	385600	I've watched several.
385600	386600	Sure.
386600	390600	Did we ever talk about me getting into strap on porn?
390600	391600	No.
391600	392600	I feel like we.
392600	393600	No.
393600	394600	I know.
394600	395600	I think we've kind of breezed over that somehow.
395600	396840	Right.
396840	400800	There was sort of a rush, there's like, it's, it's, it's really because of the high definition
400800	407320	like it's girl on girl and it's like, I think it's like Russian or something.
407320	414360	And like they, but they wear a lot of pantyhose and I'm like, I have a fetish in that area.
414360	420200	But then it's like they use the pantyhose to like hold in a strap on.
420200	421200	It's not a strap on.
421200	425600	It's called, it's called strapless dildo action.
425600	426600	How does it attach?
426600	427600	Brows.
427600	429600	How does it stay attached?
429600	432680	What do they, they tie up, they tie some hose around the edge of the dildo?
432680	437800	They kind of like, I think, I think there's a thing called the field does that ring a
437800	438800	bell?
438800	439800	Of course.
439800	440920	Because it's not strapped on.
440920	446240	It's actually there's, it's inserted on the other, on the host side, double dildo such
446240	449120	so that you're feeling it as you're using it.
449120	453640	So it's not, you know, it's, I think it more passes the Bechdel test as a stress as a,
453640	458640	as a, as a girl on girl, like a penetrative instrument.
458640	463040	It's more like, Hey, this is, this isn't just about pretending there's a Dick here.
463040	465160	This is like, this is about feeling good.
465160	466160	Oh man.
466160	467160	Rob Schrab, everybody.
467160	468160	Oh yeah.
468160	469160	Hey, Rob.
469160	470160	Hello, Jeff.
470160	481520	Rob, you've got a mysterious package in your lap there.
481520	483520	It's a field though.
483520	485400	Yes.
485400	490960	It is, it is, that, that could be the exact size of a box for, for a large, I don't know
490960	491960	what's in it.
491960	497840	So based off of what Dan was saying, I thought there's an opening, man.
497840	498840	I'm going to go for it.
498840	499840	An opening.
499840	500840	Get it?
500840	501840	All right.
501840	502840	Yeah.
502840	503840	Well, we got a guest tonight.
503840	504840	So, uh, okay.
504840	511520	If you're going to explain what this is, it's a box that you showed me in the, uh, I guess
511520	516600	we should start with our text conversation because you're, uh, it's important for me
516600	519640	to let people know what an asshole you are.
519640	529660	Uh, you know, some of you may know that Rob, uh, I, uh, my, my fiance took a pretty nice
529660	533040	photo of me at a hotel in Pasadena.
533040	534680	I looking handsome and happy.
534680	538840	Is there any way we could put it up on a, on the screen?
538840	539840	It doesn't matter.
539840	540840	It doesn't matter.
540840	544040	No, I think the audience would like to know what you're talking about.
544040	549360	I'm not going to, Chris, is there a way to put that image up on the, uh, we thought
549360	550360	of that before.
550360	551800	There definitely would have been a way.
551800	552800	Gembotron.
552800	553800	It doesn't matter.
553800	554800	It doesn't matter.
554800	555800	It's a, it's a podcast.
555800	560560	I've given up on a visuals, um, I've given up on a lot of things and I had a rare moment
560560	564920	of happiness at a hotel in Pasadena and Cody captured it and I was looking very handsome
564920	567360	and she called me a snack.
567360	568360	Right.
568560	572960	Which is a reference used by the boys from Hollywood handbook who I believe are going
572960	574800	to be guesting on the show next week.
574800	577040	Oh, um, excited.
577040	578040	Wow.
578040	579640	I think so.
579640	583240	Uh, and, uh, so Cody, uh, yeah, it was nice.
583240	590880	And then Rob took the photo and he used it like it is very juvenile, you know, color
590880	591880	marker way.
591880	599760	He put lipstick and eye makeup and a ponytail and a purse on me and, and breasts.
599760	604160	But the purse was so crudely drawn that he had to write the word purse on an arrow pointing
604160	605160	to the purse.
605160	606160	And I was using my finger.
606160	608880	Yeah, it was kind of, you can, you can, oh, really?
608880	610880	I couldn't tell from the lettering.
610880	616520	I thought you had a special stylus show was sure you're using a Cintiq tablet.
616960	624720	No, he used his fucking ape finger and his dumb old man phone probably has the, uh, the,
624720	632760	uh, disability settings on zoom so he can read text from his long suffering wife.
636760	637760	Please continue.
637760	640000	Then what happened?
640000	643480	So he made this photo and then he put it and then he, and then he immediately started selling
643480	651160	it on a t-shirt called Dan Harmon and his purse t-shirt for $14.
651160	657800	If you have a phone, maybe take a second to go to my Instagram, Rob's shop and just see
657800	660800	what we're talking about since we can't have, have this.
660800	666960	And if you want to buy a t-shirt, go ahead because it's, it's, it's going down.
666960	669360	It's, it's only up for another 24 hours.
669360	673360	You only have another 24 hours to own this piece of history.
673360	676960	You could actually sue him, Dan, you know, people aren't allowed to profit off of your
676960	678720	image without your consent.
678720	680000	He won't do it.
680000	689280	So today at 6 44 PM, he texts me, I deserve a ride to the show tonight.
689280	693800	And I said, you mocked me online in front of the dozens to three dozen people that follow
693800	696240	you.
696240	700320	And he said, sold 25 shirts.
700320	704440	And I said, undercut a decade of work toward gender equality.
704440	706720	And he said, you're welcome.
706720	709600	And he said, Cody and Kate heated it.
709600	712100	I'll be out front at 7 30.
712100	717600	And I said, parentheses, hearted.
717600	719320	He meant to say hearted.
719320	722480	They know I did it.
722480	727360	What did they heat it with a fucking shut up?
727360	728560	Stupid.
728560	735920	So and then he got in the car at 7 30 and with this box, and it says it's from Mike
735920	737440	Cravello's world.
737440	738640	Yes.
738640	744360	Which is a camera shop in Milwaukee celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.
744360	747760	And if you know us, you know that we love the song that there's a great local ad that
747760	751000	have a wonderful jingle that we adore.
751000	756560	When you're thinking cameras, there's a world of things to see.
756560	764200	We've got a choice from a wide selection of the highest quality and a staff of professional
764200	768320	people dedicated to serving you.
768320	774480	So when you're thinking cameras, one place stands alone.
774480	780800	Mike Cravello's world has got that as for something of service and quality.
780800	790960	A warm and friendly world reflecting our lives through photography.
790960	797520	Mike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.
797520	802680	Mike Cravello's world is a wonderful world of cameras.
802680	805560	Happy 50th anniversary.
805560	809640	My parents worked in the film industry in Milwaukee.
810560	818360	And by that, I mean my dad kind of mopped floors at this place where they had chemical
818360	820720	vats and they would process film.
820720	823160	And my mom spliced stuff.
823160	828560	My dad kind of worked his way up to sales and things.
828560	832560	But a place called Kluge.
832560	835440	Kluge Communications, I think it was called.
835440	838600	And that's where my parents worked.
839320	843160	So they would go to Mike Cravello's Christmas party.
843160	849240	It was kind of like a who's who of Milwaukee's film community kind of thing.
849240	851240	All that fucking happened there.
851240	855960	I just really does seem, I remember my parents coming home and going, whoa, that Mike Cravello's
855960	858320	world is fucking crazy.
858320	859560	I was like, what do you mean?
859560	862600	They're like, ice sculptures and there was a live python?
862600	866520	It just sounded very fondue orgy.
866560	870440	I always pictured Mike Cravello as like this Robert Evans.
870440	873880	Anyways, his world is a wonderful world of cameras.
873880	874880	Wonderful world of cameras.
874880	879200	Anyway, on my way back from Atlanta, where I was shooting Creepshow, which is coming
879200	889280	to shutter this fall, I stopped home in Milwaukee and went to dinner with my family.
889280	894600	And on the way, Mike Cravello's was there and I said, I got to fucking go to Mike Cravello's.
894600	899480	I walked in, talked it, chatted up with the with the team.
899480	902560	They showed me around, showed me behind the scenes.
902560	905800	They seemed like they were dedicated to serving you.
905800	908960	Yeah, they were dedicated.
908960	917400	And you know, this this afternoon, when I came home, this box was waiting for me from
917400	920880	Mike Cravello's and I haven't opened it up yet.
920880	931840	And to bring some showmanship to this show, this dead elephant, this snog, to bring it
931840	935640	back to entertain some of these people for once.
935640	936640	All right.
936640	938640	I'm going to open.
938640	939640	What?
939640	940640	Slog?
940640	941640	Snog?
941640	942640	Snog?
942640	950680	Like the British slang for kissing?
950680	957120	I'm going to open this box on live podcast.
957120	973960	OK, well, you know, some fucking mics are expensive, man.
973960	977520	So Robert's having a little difficulty with the tape.
977520	978520	I don't think he's trying.
978520	979520	You're building a suspense.
979840	983960	Yeah, you're like you're like like Johnny Carson, like Karnak opening the envelope.
983960	990360	You know, we've got to we lost a opening up the ball.
990360	991360	You're not even trying.
991360	994920	Do you want me to show you like a blade or something like that?
994920	996760	It sounds like he doesn't want that.
996760	997760	All right.
997760	998760	You've got enough to pull now.
998760	999760	You've got enough to pull.
999760	1000760	All right.
1000760	1001760	That's a piece of tape.
1001760	1011520	When you think in cameras, there's a world of things I told our guest, you know, we usually
1011520	1014480	talk for 10 minutes and then I'll bring you out.
1014480	1020920	Oh, there's no there's no clock.
1020920	1025360	My dad sued my mom for twenty thousand dollars.
1025360	1027120	Are you sure you're allowed to talk about this in front of people?
1027120	1028120	I don't care.
1028120	1029520	I hope they both die.
1029520	1037320	Oh, no, but my when my parents split up, my dad like I don't think this is going to follow
1037320	1038320	that.
1038320	1043240	So yeah, I'm going to open this a little quicker and we can get back to save that story.
1043240	1047560	Let's put a bit in that because you're going to go and I hate each other and I've never
1047560	1048560	done it.
1048560	1049560	I used to beat me on Christmas.
1049560	1050560	I'm going to go.
1050560	1053560	Oh, it's a napkin.
1053560	1057160	That sounds like the best possible way things could go.
1057880	1064840	Well, I could eulogize John Singleton, Generation X legend, who's taken from us way too early
1064840	1067040	today at the age of 51.
1067040	1072840	I guess he had a stroke in April and his family had to make a terrible decision today to to
1072840	1075160	take him off life support.
1075160	1080840	So the the youngest director ever in the history of the Academy Awards 23 to be nominated.
1080840	1084640	I thought it was twenty four boys in the hood, but maybe he was twenty four when he got nominated.
1084640	1085640	I don't know.
1085640	1086640	Maybe he was twenty three when he made it.
1086640	1088040	You've stopped to correct me.
1088040	1089040	Keep going.
1089040	1092640	Well, it's probably important to people who keep track of these fucking records.
1092640	1096000	I read on line twenty three.
1096000	1100600	Also the first African American to be nominated in that category, but we don't see race at
1100600	1102040	Harman Town.
1102040	1103400	We only see youth.
1103400	1105840	Youth is the only thing that matters to us.
1105840	1119600	It's a sign.
1119600	1125600	It's a sign.
1125600	1127600	Wrapped in plastic.
1127600	1131520	Are you fucking kidding me?
1131520	1133600	Made out of plastic.
1133600	1136840	They couldn't find a smaller box for that.
1136840	1141960	What a day.
1141960	1147040	One for me and one for Spencer.
1147040	1155800	Yeah, that's good.
1155800	1160920	Just hold it like that for however long he talks.
1160920	1162280	There's nothing else in that box.
1162280	1163280	Like maybe a camera.
1163280	1164280	Is there a letter?
1164280	1165280	Look, yeah.
1165280	1166280	Keep looking at the part.
1166280	1167280	I'm looking.
1167280	1168280	It looks empty.
1168280	1169280	That's empty.
1169280	1170280	It's pretty empty.
1170280	1175280	So he just gave you advertising.
1175280	1176280	That's great.
1176280	1182240	As a forest of trees died for that box, you could definitely put these in an envelope.
1182240	1186440	These are a forest.
1186440	1187440	There you go.
1187440	1188440	There we go.
1188440	1189440	What do you think?
1189440	1190440	Logo.
1191440	1196440	I think John Singleton was 23.
1196440	1199440	Yeah, that's what I read too.
1199440	1204440	I don't know why he's got his head up his ass all the time.
1204440	1208440	You got a couple of years, I'll explain it to you.
1208440	1219440	Okay, well, our first guest, our next guest, is a self-made,
1220440	1229440	internet curator of mirth and frivolity.
1229440	1236440	He's the founder of Overheard in LA, which is an Instagram that's majorly followed.
1236440	1242440	He went on to become the founder of many franchised thingamabobs that sprung out from that,
1242440	1247440	but made himself out of dirt without permission, just like somebody I know named Dan Harmon.
1247440	1251440	Please welcome the Dan Harmon of Instagram, Jesse Margolis.
1256440	1259440	I'm not that good at introductions, I'm sorry, Jesse.
1261440	1263440	Come on, move down, Mike.
1263440	1265440	What's up, Jesse?
1265440	1267440	Hello.
1267440	1270440	Thanks for creating Overheard LA.
1270440	1273440	That's the username if you want to follow it on Instagram, right?
1273440	1274440	It's Overheard LA.
1274440	1276440	It is Overheard LA.
1276440	1280440	We've got a bunch now, but yeah, that was the first child.
1280440	1286440	I commented today, and in the past, and I've got to retract this now, as I said in my comment today,
1286440	1289440	because I was like, in the past, I have seen one.
1289440	1292440	I guess people have a visceral reaction when they think one is fake.
1292440	1296440	First of all, let's give a classic example, whether it's your favorite
1296440	1301440	or you just think it's like a classic Overheard LA kind of quote.
1301440	1305440	I think my all-time favorite is, you can't be vegan in jail.
1307440	1317440	I don't know if that's true, or in Yale, I don't know if you can be vegan in jail.
1317440	1322440	There was one yesterday, but in the past, I remember seeing one, and I can't remember which one I saw,
1322440	1324440	where I was like, I hate it when they're fake.
1324440	1327440	I had this visceral reaction, I feel like my job is to police.
1327440	1329440	That one's fake.
1330440	1339440	It comes out of a place of love, because the joy isn't like, oh, this is a hilariously written thing.
1339440	1343440	The joy isn't really believing that this was genuinely overheard,
1343440	1349440	and then I guess it trips a kind of anger in people that I can attest to
1349440	1354440	when it meets our definition of phony or something, or like, this one's fake.
1354440	1361440	But the weird thing is, I'm never doing it again, because I saw one the other day, yesterday,
1361440	1366440	it was like a kid on a plane, like a four-year-old on a plane or something that was taxiing,
1366440	1370440	and the kid says, Alexa, fly me up into the sky now.
1370440	1374440	This is the kid saying that, and everyone's like, this is fucking...
1374440	1376440	This is the most fucking real thing ever.
1376440	1382440	It was 10 years ago, Jeff said he saw some kid at the airport pinching and zooming a magazine cover.
1383440	1386440	Of course, these larva think that...
1386440	1392440	I think I wrote, I'm just surprised the plane didn't shoot up in the air and land like a fucking lawn dart.
1392440	1394440	Jesse, how is that curated?
1394440	1400440	People submit them, and then there's a team of people that select the ones that go up on the grains?
1400440	1403440	Yes, there's a bi-pedal Jewish Instagram account sitting right here.
1403440	1404440	Oh, you do.
1404440	1405440	It's all you.
1405440	1406440	It goes through it.
1406440	1410440	No, we have a team of people, but in terms of the LA account, I go through it.
1410440	1412440	So we get submissions.
1412440	1416440	You know, we aren't journalists, you know?
1416440	1418440	Well, sometimes also...
1418440	1419440	Yeah, I mean, well, you can't...
1419440	1420440	Because sometimes...
1420440	1423440	There was another recent one, for instance, where it was a...
1423440	1428440	I'm obsessed with your show, and you have the canon of a fucking meme account.
1429440	1434440	There was one where there was a guest talking to a host at a restaurant,
1434440	1437440	and then people were like, that was a really mean thing to say or something like that,
1437440	1442440	and then this will happen a lot, like in the comments, a person who was involved with the quote,
1442440	1446440	which doesn't surprise me, because that's probably a person that submitted or whatever,
1446440	1450440	and they go like, oh, that was me, actually, and the host was my friend,
1450440	1452440	and they were kind of razzing me.
1452440	1455440	But it was like, oh, and then someone overheard it, and it's like...
1455440	1459440	So it's both true, but at the same time, it wasn't like a stranger,
1459440	1465440	like taking the shit out of a stranger, as maybe the overheard person thought, but...
1466440	1470440	Yeah, I think it kills me, because obviously when you create something,
1470440	1478440	whether it's a giant television show or a podcast on stage or whatever it is, you care about it.
1478440	1480440	We like to call it a snog.
1485440	1486440	You care about it.
1486440	1492440	So I see those comments, and it's a little frustrating because that's a sort of white box,
1492440	1497440	and people look at that white box for the last couple of years, those who care enough to follow it or whatever,
1497440	1501440	and hopefully they have their own moment of imagination.
1501440	1506440	They know the location, they've met some douchebag like that, they've been that douchebag, whatever it is.
1506440	1511440	And yeah, the internet is a place for people to get angry, and...
1512440	1517440	Do you have a filter that you applied, do you see things?
1517440	1521440	That's probably, somebody wrote that, that seems too good to be true or something like that?
1521440	1525440	I don't know what the word is, where you Google on Twitter, like...
1525440	1526440	Google?
1526440	1528440	No, you search on...
1528440	1535440	Yeah, so basically if anything is too good, or it's just too on point, we'll do a Google search,
1535440	1543440	and I'll search on Twitter, which is usually where a lot of great comedians and smart people have been slamming away for the last 10 years.
1543440	1547440	And then we'll sort of post something, and I'll do a little browse of the comments.
1548440	1551440	I know sometimes we've posted stuff, and 20 minutes in, someone will be like,
1551440	1554440	that's from the Mindy show, from episode six.
1554440	1555440	And I'm like, okay.
1555440	1560440	You know, obviously someone's had a similar experience, or someone's tried to get on the account, so then we just delete it.
1560440	1566440	Is there a kind of, on the other end of that spectrum, is there...
1566440	1573440	Are there qualities, criteria that make for a particularly LA-ish quote, or, you know, like,
1573440	1576440	someone's like, oh, now that's an overheard LA gem.
1576440	1580440	Yeah, I mean, the problem with LA is it can be so magical.
1580440	1582440	Like, I don't know if you're familiar with Cafe Gratitude.
1582440	1588440	I'm sure you're there daily, but it's a restaurant you go to, and you sort of, you know, have to, like,
1588440	1592440	you know, say this mantra while you order your, like, vegan slop.
1592440	1593440	And they write stuff.
1593440	1596440	It's a very Pete Holmes restaurant.
1596440	1597440	Yeah, I think Pete Holmes loves it.
1597440	1601440	Yeah, the names of the foods are all kind of, like, IME or V or something.
1601440	1606440	Keeps Love and a Hole and, you know, Sparkle Joy, but, like, it's very similar to Kendrick Lamar's,
1606440	1610440	you know, album Damn, you know, like, Humble and Love and stuff like that.
1610440	1611440	Mm-hmm.
1611440	1617440	So, you know, I mean, there's specific things where, you know, it's the cocaine and the vegans.
1617440	1618440	Right.
1618440	1619440	And the absurd.
1619440	1624440	It's that blend of self-care, self-loathing, self-obsession, like, all the selfs.
1624440	1625440	That's the LA thing.
1626440	1631440	It's like people believing that, I mean, it's like the same people talking about yoga,
1631440	1634440	you know, who did ketamine last night kind of thing.
1634440	1635440	Yeah.
1635440	1636440	Yeah, or Yoda.
1636440	1637440	Yeah.
1637440	1641440	So, hopefully it's something that, you know, is relatable in the worst or the best way,
1641440	1642440	but isn't so tropey.
1642440	1647440	I think the LA account, like, the New York account is sometimes, you know, more interesting
1647440	1649440	because New York's just a more forgiving place.
1649440	1651440	It's like you can imagine anything happening in New York.
1651440	1655440	You can imagine someone on the street, you know, trying to give away an espresso machine.
1655440	1656440	Right.
1656440	1660440	Whereas in LA, you're like, no one talks to each other, you know, you're not on the street.
1660440	1661440	Yeah.
1661440	1667440	New York's got the built-in, there's the blue-collar guys that you wouldn't even believe existed
1667440	1668440	in LA.
1668440	1673440	Like, you could make one up in New York because it would be like, like, oh, excuse me, sir,
1673440	1675440	where can I feed my chihuahua?
1675440	1680440	And then some guy going, lady, I'm going to eat that fucking thing.
1680440	1683440	Oh, hey, oh, I'm lifting a stained glass.
1683440	1685440	I don't know.
1685440	1687440	I've never been to New York.
1687440	1692440	Yeah, I mean, I worked at the Humane Society of New York and it was very similar to that.
1692440	1698440	But yeah, so in some ways, LA's, you know, it's a harder account to do because, you know,
1698440	1702440	you really want it to be special and there are these tropes because they're true.
1702440	1703440	Yeah.
1703440	1706440	We should tell the story about the creation of this just for a second.
1706440	1711440	2016, you, I mean, is that the right year, maybe?
1711440	1713440	Yeah, it was like late 2015.
1713440	1720440	You really just, as anyone might expect, I mean, you're just doing it, doing the thing.
1720440	1722440	I mean, it's some shit you overheard yourself.
1722440	1726440	Yeah, well, it started out, I mean, I don't know if it's interesting or not, but it started
1726440	1731440	off with me being pretty broke and spending a lot of time at Erewhon, which is, you know,
1731440	1736440	sort of elevated whole foods, you know, sort of like daytime nightclub where they sell
1736440	1740440	like $24, you know, sprouted, you know.
1740440	1742440	And it's nowhere backwards, man.
1742440	1744440	It's not technically nowhere backwards, but it is close.
1744440	1745440	Yeah, it's close.
1745440	1747440	I need to see LA more.
1747440	1748440	Yeah, I got a ticket to Erewhon.
1748440	1750440	It's really fucking terrible.
1750440	1755440	But I had sort of, someone had made me an Instagram account called ThinJewish and this was like
1755440	1759440	when Instagram was first starting and I didn't really know, you know, what Instagram was.
1759440	1764440	I didn't, I never put my face on social media, but I just started sort of using it as an outlet
1764440	1767440	for whatever desperate creative, you know.
1767440	1768440	So I would do like Rorsch.
1768440	1773440	I would, you know, I had a little like barista and he would, I would do these Rorschach foam latte
1773440	1778440	interpretations or emoji book covers and I would do like 12 likes.
1778440	1780440	And, you know, I was just kind of messing around.
1780440	1784440	And I was sitting at Erewhon and these two women were talking and they were talking about their
1784440	1787440	friend Lisa, who was just obsessed with schwag.
1787440	1791440	And she, like her pitbull was out of control and they had to freeze their eggs.
1791440	1796440	And I was just like, you know, as we've all had that moment where you're just sitting in public
1796440	1801440	and a conversation just sort of comes to you and you just sort of, you know, just enjoy it.
1801440	1804440	So I just wrote it down and posted it on my account.
1804440	1809440	And you talked backstage about, I think the interesting part of the story, because then it goes from there.
1809440	1813440	It's like, that's when you start to make people jealous and maybe draw some ire from the
1813440	1816440	self-starters in the audience that haven't self-started yet.
1816440	1821440	Because like from there, it just like, it gets popular and then you franchise it and you're like,
1821440	1825440	you got like five employees because you got, there's overheard London, there's overheard New York.
1825440	1830440	And then you also do like these branded things with like Uber and what have you.
1830440	1835440	Like where you're actually, I mean, what I like to hear is these stories that start and within two years,
1835440	1842440	you've got a creative person or like, like that is paying their rent in a brand new fucking way
1842440	1852440	that never existed. And like without, it's like, we don't have to exploit labor or be billion.
1852440	1858440	It's just like, you just created a job for yourself with this, with this tool that is also often like
1858440	1862440	the source of just dehumanization and misery.
1862440	1867440	Like these, it's this larger function is like, yeah, but you know, people, you could just make your own job.
1867440	1872440	Like Rob selling t-shirts, he's making $2, ridiculing me.
1872440	1873440	$14?
1873440	1875440	I make $2.
1875440	1876440	Okay.
1876440	1881440	Yeah. But anyways, but I, but I think the interesting thing.
1881440	1883440	Milwaukee dollars or American dollars?
1883440	1886440	Just normal, regular, friend dollars.
1886440	1889440	So you're up 30 bones just from a couple of days ago.
1889440	1891440	Bones, dude, that's amazing. Yes.
1891440	1892440	I haven't used that word.
1892440	1893440	What bones?
1893440	1894440	Yeah, it's fine.
1894440	1898440	No, but you make a great point. Like people love to hit it on Instagram.
1898440	1900440	Right.
1900440	1904440	And social media. But I mean, Instagram genuinely saved my life.
1904440	1907440	Like I was just a permanent fuck up the friend with potential.
1907440	1913440	This is an interesting, just random difference between these platforms that Instagram didn't have in mind at all.
1913440	1919440	And like it, because this is a thing that works on Instagram and as you said backstage, it wouldn't work on Twitter.
1919440	1920440	It doesn't work on Twitter.
1920440	1921440	Oh, there's much better shit on Twitter.
1921440	1930440	It, it, Twitter, Twitter is like all text based and your thing is text based, but your thing works on Instagram and where it is vastly monetizable.
1930440	1933440	Nothing's monetizable on Twitter except like the presidency.
1933440	1938440	You could, I mean, if you're playing for the big bucks, you can like make a lot of money on Twitter.
1938440	1949440	But it's just interesting to me that also tonally, and maybe this is part of it, is that if you tweet that you overheard something, you're kind of a, you're almost more of a dick than,
1949440	1956440	than an Instagram that like curates it in a classy kind of like way that's sort of like, this is a celebration of the city.
1956440	1961440	And it's like, what's fascinating to me is why that works, like what the psychological routing is.
1961440	1965440	Yeah, I don't know. My theory on Instagram, because I'm like, what if we don't overheard it?
1965440	1973440	Because it's certainly not a new idea, you know, like the idea of anyone with a brain and, you know, a red moleskin journal that they don't use is, you know,
1973440	1977440	had that moment in public where someone said something weird and they've written it down.
1977440	1979440	By the way, do you want to drink? Sometimes people...
1979440	1982440	I've had like, I have two drinks a year and it's usually with a...
1982440	1983440	Better drinker?
1983440	1984440	A girl.
1984440	1985440	Okay.
1985440	1988440	But yeah, I would take like a tiny amount, like a thimble, like a...
1988440	1990440	Can we get this man a thimble?
1990440	1991440	Like a D20.
1991440	1992440	A D20.
1992440	1993440	Like a D20.
1993440	1995440	Nice to sneak in, try to play to the crowd.
1995440	1996440	Hey, man.
1996440	1998440	I grew up rolling dice, okay.
1998440	2001440	It's true, we talked about it backstage.
2002440	2004440	We got deep.
2004440	2012440	But the truth is, is that like overheard on Twitter, on Facebook, it's just, it's part of the maelstrom of whatever.
2012440	2017440	For some reason, doing it on Instagram, having it text only, having it sort of being...
2017440	2018440	Thank you.
2018440	2020440	That's like a D100, but thank you.
2020440	2021440	Yeah.
2021440	2029440	Having it be kind of enshrined as an image where you can geotag it and you can have details in the caption.
2029440	2034440	So you have this sort of double experience where you like, you read the thing and then you sort of go down and you go like, oh, you know, where was it?
2034440	2035440	Do I know that place?
2035440	2036440	Do I know that person?
2036440	2037440	Do you still put your own in?
2037440	2040440	Like, when you hear one, do you drop your own overheards in there?
2040440	2053440	I reserve about 2% of the account for myself, but not, you know, I mean, certainly at the beginning I was, you know, and I would imagine that some of it is genuinely overheard, some of it is friends sitting around talking shit and sending it in.
2053440	2058440	I sent you one that was two people that I was working with that were talking, but I still overheard it.
2059440	2060440	I thought it was funny.
2060440	2064440	It was like girls like talking to each other about setting each other up or whatever.
2064440	2070440	And one of them, Nicole, was like, she's like so young that being set up is still fun.
2070440	2080440	The idea of like, she's just saying to our friend, Leslie Arfin, like, she's like, you gotta, I keep telling you, you know, set me up with some of these nerdy guys.
2080440	2085440	And Leslie had some really, I don't know, in the room, it was really funny.
2085440	2087440	She was just like, I was just listening to them.
2087440	2090440	And she's like, yeah, but no, you don't understand.
2090440	2093440	It's like, they're actual nerds.
2093440	2095440	It's like, it's gross.
2095440	2096440	It's not like Rushmore.
2098440	2099440	Like, real nerds.
2099440	2101440	Like, it's not marketable.
2103440	2104440	Gav nerds, yeah.
2104440	2106440	That's when I sent you that.
2106440	2109440	I was like, I've never submitted anything to overheard LA.
2109440	2111440	I'm gonna do this.
2111440	2114440	And then I got this response from, I assume you, that was like,
2114440	2117440	what are you doing submitting to my thing?
2117440	2118440	I love your stuff.
2118440	2120440	Like Dungeons and Dragons episode community.
2120440	2121440	Why are you talking to me?
2121440	2122440	That kind of stuff.
2122440	2126440	And then you didn't use my overheard quote, but it's, I mean, it does that because I'm not good at it.
2126440	2127440	I'm good.
2127440	2132440	Obviously, what are the odds that I'm going to be good at overhearing and also a genius and all these other things.
2133440	2138440	I think I said in the show before my one that they overheard the two gals at the at the bar about vampires.
2138440	2140440	Did I say that one?
2140440	2141440	I can't say it.
2141440	2146440	I walked into the burgundy room a long time ago and there was just two like kind of like rock and roll chicks at the bar.
2146440	2148440	And I walk up and this is all I heard.
2148440	2150440	Why are vampires so hot?
2150440	2153440	And the other girl says, duh, because they're thin.
2155440	2157440	That's that's fucking good.
2157440	2163440	Yeah, I can certainly understand why people think the account is bullshit because everything kind of becomes bullshit at some point.
2163440	2166440	Well, I don't think I hope you didn't get that message.
2166440	2169440	No, but I mean, I'm just in terms of the comments and stuff like that.
2169440	2171440	But I mean, I was I actually have been overheard.
2171440	2180440	Like I have sat somewhere at a cafe, spoken in a way that I thought was authentic, but was actually incredibly, you know, embarrassing and douchey.
2180440	2186440	And then have like some coy little cat person write my conversation down.
2186440	2188440	Obviously, I try to keep my face away from the account.
2188440	2194440	I think it's a more interesting account if it's not about a person and have her submit me to me an hour later.
2194440	2195440	Right. Oh, my God.
2195440	2196440	That's insane.
2196440	2197440	Yes.
2197440	2199440	So what? Well, you've got to give us a specific.
2199440	2201440	Like, what's the thing you said that you got?
2201440	2203440	That is that is really interesting.
2203440	2204440	Yeah.
2204440	2209440	I would vibrate something that's like, I just, you know, it's like asterisk douchebag at Whole Foods or whatever.
2209440	2211440	Like, that's me.
2211440	2214440	I'm looking for garlic stuffed olives.
2215440	2216440	Well, there were two.
2216440	2218440	There was one I was sitting.
2218440	2220440	I was sitting at Verve.
2220440	2221440	V.R.V. Verve.
2221440	2222440	Hell yeah.
2222440	2223440	I was sitting at Verve.
2223440	2224440	I worked there.
2224440	2228440	And this was early days and these two girls, they were like musicians.
2228440	2230440	They were cool, whatever.
2230440	2234440	And they sat down right next to me at Verve on Third Street, like right next to me.
2234440	2240440	And they start they just sort of like brought themselves, you know, into my space in the way that some people in L.A. do.
2240440	2242440	And I guess there are musicians.
2242440	2244440	They were like, God, I miss I miss Sweden.
2244440	2246440	It's just so much more authentic there.
2246440	2249440	It's just like people in Europe just understand music.
2249440	2250440	They just get it.
2250440	2255440	And then and then the other girl just leans in really seriously and she's like, so what's your writing process?
2255440	2258440	And I was just like just fucking listening.
2258440	2263440	I was like, whatever, you know, like give me the fucking gold that's about to come from your deranged brain.
2263440	2266440	And she's like, well, it sounds stupid.
2266440	2269440	But like, have you heard of this Instagram account over here at L.A.?
2269440	2271440	And I was just like, huh?
2271440	2272440	I thought it was a sort of bit.
2272440	2277440	And she starts saying that like there was this post about glitter and it was really funny.
2277440	2280440	So she like went home and wrote a song about glitter.
2280440	2283440	And I was just like sitting there and I was just like, OK.
2283440	2286440	And then I posted that sort of like, you know, that's like a Hall of Mirrors.
2286440	2291440	Like you're like you're like you're like you're seeing yourself in them, which is bouncing back and forth.
2291440	2293440	I remember something about that.
2293440	2295440	I remember that being posted.
2295440	2296440	I posted it and yeah.
2296440	2298440	And then the other one was like maybe a year ago.
2298440	2305440	I was sitting at La Colombe in Silver Lake and I was whining to my female friend about women in L.A.
2305440	2313440	and how they date the same 12 celebrities and, you know, this, you know, naming names and like, you know, the whole thing.
2313440	2315440	And then she just kind of submitted it to me.
2315440	2319440	I was like, oh, I was like, wow, I'm like a middle aged douche.
2319440	2321440	Like what's wrong with me?
2321440	2322440	I was on a plane.
2322440	2324440	Maybe it's something if I mentioned this before.
2324440	2329440	I was sitting on a plane and we're getting ready to like the passengers still boarding.
2329440	2331440	And so they haven't like closed the door yet.
2331440	2333440	And there was an older gentleman behind me.
2333440	2340440	And he was on like on his phone, like giving his will.
2340440	2342440	And he's like, hello, my name is James.
2342440	2345440	And I did today's date is so mine and body.
2345440	2347440	I'd like to amend my will.
2347440	2348440	I'm going to change a couple of things.
2348440	2351440	He started shaking it up like someone's going to get the thing.
2351440	2353440	But now I'm going to give it to someone.
2353440	2362440	So I was like, I think every time he gets on a plane, it's like, you know, it's like Susan.
2362440	2365440	But I want to leave back and say, hey, man, is this something you know that I don't know?
2365440	2369440	I told Susan I was flying Delta and she got dollar signs in her eyes.
2369440	2370440	I don't know.
2370440	2373440	She's not getting a goddamn dime.
2373440	2376440	Delta is a dangerous airline.
2376440	2377440	It is?
2377440	2378440	I don't know.
2378440	2379440	I just I don't even care.
2379440	2385440	I don't care what airline I affect negatively.
2385440	2388440	Except JetBlue, New York to LA or vice versa.
2388440	2389440	That's a good one.
2389440	2391440	That's the one I should take.
2391440	2392440	I don't know.
2392440	2394440	They're probably they think they're phased out because they're phased out.
2394440	2397440	They got caught being good or something.
2397440	2399440	I've been taking Delta a lot lately.
2399440	2400440	That's why I'm asking.
2400440	2403440	Delta is the one that I really I.
2403440	2407440	Well, I mean, yeah, like like Delta is the one that sat me in coach.
2407440	2409440	Give me give me a moment.
2409440	2410440	OK, OK.
2410440	2411440	Oh, boy.
2411440	2412440	Oh, boy.
2412440	2418440	John Vinnie's and and they knew that you'd react that way so that they could get away with it.
2418440	2419440	That's the thing that really pissed me off.
2419440	2422440	I was like, all of a sudden, I'm just like, wait, wait, why is my seat blue?
2422440	2425440	And then I'm just like sitting with the, you know, the hoi poi.
2425440	2426440	The who?
2426440	2427440	The who?
2427440	2428440	The hoi poi.
2428440	2433440	OK, that's not what you call them.
2433440	2444440	The flotsam, the fucking driftwood, the people, the constituency, the civilians.
2444440	2446440	Bernie Sanders sits there.
2446440	2447440	Yeah.
2447440	2448440	Yeah.
2448440	2450440	And I was like, excuse me.
2450440	2451440	What's the thing?
2451440	2456440	But the guy the guy in the he just stood in the aisle and he made this big deal like projecting his voice.
2456440	2465440	He like really he knew exactly the kind of social leverage that he had, that I was a douchebag who got all the way to his seat before realizing they had fucked him over.
2465440	2470440	And so he knew that everything that was being said was being overheard by everyone.
2470440	2473440	I was going to have to sit next to you for six hours wherever.
2473440	2477440	And like so he just fucking it was like they just fucked me over, man.
2477440	2484440	It was like it was like he was like, oh, I oh, I like I wish you had brought it to our attention sooner.
2484440	2489440	But what the you changing my seat to a completely different.
2489440	2490440	What?
2490440	2491440	It was just so weird.
2491440	2494440	I was like, what would have happened if I had brought it to you earlier?
2494440	2500440	Like what you would have then you would have kicked someone out of first class that you overbooked.
2500440	2502440	And he's like, no, he would have given you miles.
2502440	2505440	Delta miles?
2505440	2508440	I don't I don't want Delta miles.
2508440	2510440	I don't want to be on this plane.
2510440	2512440	So so you had to sit in coach.
2512440	2513440	Yeah.
2513440	2518440	Next to a bunch of next to a bunch of people who overheard that I'm a fucking asshole that thinks they're better than them.
2518440	2523440	And I'm like, you fucking don't grow my arm hair with these people.
2523440	2531440	Yeah, both both people watching Avatar at different times fucking can't look away.
2531440	2533440	I got to see the rest of Avatar.
2533440	2535440	It's the only way to avert my eyes from fucking Avatar.
2535440	2541440	But I mean, they're telling you that, hey, we just burned three thousand of your dollars.
2541440	2542440	I know. It's insane.
2542440	2543440	Like I never got recompense.
2543440	2544440	I never.
2544440	2547440	I mean, like it's it's Delta.
2547440	2549440	You know what their slogan should be?
2549440	2552440	No recompense.
2552440	2554440	No recompense.
2554440	2561440	Don't expect any recompense here at Delta Airlines.
2561440	2566440	It should be something in the area of whoever smelt a.
2566440	2569440	All right.
2569440	2570440	There's no Delta lines.
2570440	2571440	Whoever smelt a.
2571440	2575440	There's no airlines that people talk about and like have good things to say.
2575440	2576440	I guess JetBlue.
2576440	2579440	But like people are like wasn't Virgin.
2579440	2580440	I don't know.
2580440	2581440	And then they caught him being good.
2581440	2583440	And now Virgin got by Alaska.
2583440	2585440	Now Virgin is just Alaska.
2585440	2587440	But they got better lighting.
2587440	2589440	They took all the disco lighting.
2589440	2592440	And slowly the purple lights are probably dangling.
2592440	2595440	I mean, man.
2595440	2601440	And when I was when I was coming back on Delta, man.
2601440	2604440	Man, that that was a rough landing.
2604440	2607440	I was I was sitting next to somebody.
2607440	2609440	I mean, I almost held his hand.
2609440	2612440	It was like like bumpy.
2612440	2617440	And like it was like somebody was throwing the plane up and then it was coming down.
2617440	2619440	And it was it was scary.
2619440	2623440	So that's why I'm thinking like you're on to something.
2623440	2629440	Maybe this Delta isn't as good as as they were saying because like it was it.
2629440	2634440	It was I mean, when the when the pilot goes, people just hold on.
2634440	2637440	That's not a great landing even for him.
2637440	2641440	Like the emergency seats were popping out.
2641440	2643440	The emergency seats.
2643440	2645440	Here's something.
2645440	2649440	I didn't know there were emergency seats until this flight.
2649440	2655440	They pop out of the wall and they end up in the stewardesses.
2655440	2659440	They sit in these emergency seats and they flop themselves in.
2659440	2661440	Flight workers.
2661440	2665440	And then they strap themselves into the flight workers.
2665440	2671440	And it's it was and the pilots going just hang on.
2671440	2676440	And I'm wondering what's going on in the cockpit.
2676440	2681440	Like I mean, hey, but it's a it's a capitalist society.
2681440	2690440	So all you got to do is just take that money and take it over to United and bring your dog.
2690440	2697440	And for God's sakes, if they choose you by lottery to give your seat to a richer person, don't resist.
2697440	2701440	They will beat your fucking ass and physically drag you off the plane.
2701440	2714440	Of course, then United went out of business because if you were a cookie company and you suffocated a dog and beat a man senseless and dragged him out of your cookie factory in the same fiscal fucking quarter,
2714440	2717440	you wouldn't be allowed to make cookies anymore.
2717440	2718440	But it's an airline.
2718440	2721440	So their profits probably went through the roof.
2721440	2722440	I hate it.
2722440	2723440	I hate it.
2723440	2726440	And now we're finding out what I knew the whole time.
2726440	2729440	Those things can't even stay in the air.
2729440	2732440	They're held together with fucking speaking spells.
2732440	2740440	They don't even the pilots are even they just get in there and hit a button like a Tesla and just go like Alexa, take me to fucking Reno.
2740440	2745440	And the fucking the planes are just going like now they're just going.
2745440	2746440	I saw a cloud.
2746440	2747440	I think it's a truck.
2747440	2751440	I better change lanes.
2751440	2754440	And Donald Trump's like we should have run it on coal.
2754440	2755440	We're all dead.
2755440	2756440	We're dead, man.
2756440	2758440	We're dead.
2758440	2760440	We are dead.
2760440	2765440	So anyways, like you it.
2765440	2766440	Well, yeah, it's a mystery.
2766440	2770440	In other words, like you didn't you didn't scientifically observe these things.
2770440	2772440	It was a mystery.
2772440	2777440	Why it is that some things work on Instagram and other things work on Twitter and other things work on a thing.
2777440	2778440	It's like there's nothing.
2778440	2784440	It's just sort of a it all we know is that one piece of data that well, this just works works better.
2784440	2788440	And it was very much like it came from the right place.
2788440	2792440	And I guess it landed in the right place.
2792440	2793440	You know, we have a Twitter account.
2793440	2794440	No one cares about.
2794440	2797440	I've seen you sort of pop up and down on Twitter.
2797440	2798440	You were on Twitter.
2798440	2803440	I was on Twitter was from 2009.
2803440	2806440	To like a year ago, James gun firing.
2806440	2808440	And I was like, see you till 2000.
2808440	2809440	He's back.
2809440	2811440	Well, he's yeah, he's back back.
2811440	2819440	I'm not sliding back into that fucking sewer.
2819440	2820440	You shouldn't, man.
2820440	2821440	No, I shouldn't.
2821440	2822440	I can't.
2822440	2823440	I got agreeing with.
2823440	2824440	Yeah.
2824440	2826440	Instagram is actually my only peaceful.
2826440	2827440	It's it's good.
2827440	2831440	And it's still like I can still take enough Adderall that I'll like yell at a fucking turd or whatever.
2831440	2836440	But you watch those dog memes, you know, like Chimpkin doggo friend.
2836440	2837440	Yeah.
2837440	2839440	That's like, you know, top down cooking videos.
2839440	2845440	I went through recently and I unfollowed everyone who wasn't following me.
2845440	2846440	Including.
2846440	2847440	Wow.
2847440	2848440	Holy cow.
2848440	2849440	Including us.
2849440	2850440	Well, there you go.
2850440	2851440	I know.
2851440	2852440	Are you following me?
2852440	2853440	Yeah.
2853440	2854440	I mean, I will be in about half an hour.
2854440	2856440	I don't know if I mean, maybe some things like that.
2856440	2857440	I would do.
2857440	2860440	I wasn't like, well, they're not going to put their 70 episodes.
2860440	2861440	Of what?
2861440	2869440	Oh, but it really is my only social media outlet.
2869440	2871440	I deleted my Facebook account.
2871440	2872440	I deleted my Twitter.
2872440	2880440	I was thinking the other day that Twitter, it's like there's not really any good outcome
2880440	2882440	because like, think about it.
2882440	2884440	You like you like someone's tweet.
2884440	2885440	Nothing happens.
2885440	2886440	You don't feel great.
2886440	2888440	You retweet someone's tweet.
2888440	2889440	Nothing happens.
2889440	2892440	You retweet someone's tweet and someone else retweets it.
2892440	2893440	Who cares?
2893440	2895440	You retweet someone else's tweet and someone responds to it.
2895440	2896440	Like you get pissed off.
2896440	2897440	You tweet something good.
2897440	2898440	No one retweets it.
2898440	2899440	Who cares?
2899440	2900440	You retweet something good.
2900440	2901440	A lot of people retweeted.
2901440	2904440	It's like, okay, that feels kind of okay.
2904440	2905440	Otherwise people respond to you.
2905440	2906440	It's like, this sucks.
2906440	2910440	If it goes super viral, the whole, it just everyone's screaming at you.
2910440	2913440	So it's like, there's just no, every single outcome.
2913440	2915440	It's like a choose your own adventure book.
2915440	2918440	That's just fuck you on every page.
2918440	2919440	Yeah.
2919440	2922440	I was thinking about it the other day.
2922440	2926440	I was thinking that like I have the tendency to like create all these situations that
2926440	2931440	I think will like go well, but the outcome is almost always just going to be bad.
2931440	2933440	And like, there's one out of a hundred outcomes.
2933440	2934440	That's that's that's good.
2934440	2936440	And it's like, well, why do that?
2936440	2938440	Why not do something that's like 50 50 or something?
2938440	2939440	And Twitter is like exactly that.
2939440	2943440	It's like, there's one good outcome, which is like someone you like is like, hey, you're
2943440	2944440	really cool.
2944440	2946440	But that like has never happened in the history of Twitter.
2946440	2950440	Well, at least every single fleeting thought that you've ever had for 20 years is being
2950440	2957440	slowly cataloged on a giant fucking reel to reel tape in a basement of a capital building
2957440	2965440	that obviously just at any given time might be run by a person that just sides to search
2965440	2970440	all of this by people who ever called me a shithead and send out the drones.
2970440	2975440	But like, that's what's terrifying to me is it's like this, like, when you you know,
2975440	2982440	like the 1930s in Germany when it was like, like there was a slow burn of like, like people
2982440	2987440	were like, you know, it's a march violence thing where it's like people eventually going
2987440	2990440	like, oh, okay, sorry, I changed my mind.
2990440	2992440	I think that's a great mustache.
2992440	2994440	Like, like, they're just like freaking out.
2994440	3000440	And there was like this race to like, redact and, and transpose like people's attitudes.
3000440	3004440	And like, back then, all you had was like a little bit of paperwork to fake, you could
3004440	3010440	like pay people to give you a card, a membership card in the party that was like pre backdated
3010440	3015440	that you wouldn't be like a fucking march violet.
3015440	3020440	But now we're just like, I mean, that's what terrifies me.
3020440	3022440	I'm just like, I've said it before.
3022440	3024440	It's like, it's too late.
3024440	3029440	Like I unplugged from all this stuff, but I, it's not like I did it to, I just did it
3029440	3035440	because I should, but now I'm just waiting 20 years to get shot by firing squad because
3035440	3042440	I spent 20 years before I did that going like bla bla bla bla.
3042440	3044440	Here's how I feel about everything.
3044440	3051440	Like not realizing that society was not going to continue towards like transparency as currency.
3051440	3053440	But don't you think Trump fucked Twitter up?
3053440	3058440	Like Twitter was kind of fine and then Trump happened and then everyone that you sort of
3058440	3061440	liked or respected just went fucking crazy on Twitter.
3061440	3062440	Yeah.
3062440	3063440	I mean, I don't know what chicken lays what egg.
3063440	3070440	I mean, was it that, was it that Trump ruined Twitter or was it that Twitter creeped in
3070440	3076440	on our on us like, and like, like just like installed itself somewhere between our
3076440	3082440	pituitary gland and our cerebellum and like just changed the way we think.
3082440	3087440	And so it was really, we're like micro blogging and like, like this free basing of fucking
3087440	3088440	give me attention.
3088440	3090440	And here's the thing I have to say.
3090440	3097440	And then as a byproduct of that, the, like the most likely presidential candidate who'd
3097440	3103440	been running for president for 25 years before that just like fell on that bread.
3103440	3110440	Like, like, you know, bacteria in a kitchen and just like that Petri dish was just there
3110440	3111440	for him.
3111440	3113440	And so it's like, did he ruin Twitter?
3113440	3116440	Did Twitter ruin us and grow him like a fungus?
3116440	3118440	You don't have to answer.
3118440	3120440	I mean, it's a chicken egg thing.
3120440	3122440	It's like, it's like, it's both.
3122440	3124440	It's just, this is what's, this is what's happened to us.
3124440	3129440	But I do think that the very least when you're on Instagram, you're not really seeing a person
3129440	3130440	for who they are.
3130440	3133440	You're seeing their Bernese mountain dog for who they are, but you're not seeing them
3133440	3134440	for who they are.
3134440	3139440	I like that people that are dicks, you can like click on their name and it's like 99%
3139440	3142440	of the time they're going to be a lot, they're locked.
3142440	3146440	And it's kind of like, if I was mature and I think I can become mature because I'm 46
3146440	3149440	now for something's got to give.
3149440	3154440	I think I could see myself by 50 being able to go, yeah, of course it's a locked account
3154440	3157440	because they're a coward and they're not, they're saying that and they know that they're
3157440	3158440	saying that to themselves.
3158440	3160440	Like you, you don't have to say that on Twitter.
3160440	3165440	You don't have to like declare yourself a coward in order to like have a Twitter account
3165440	3170440	that you use to just go, I think you're, I think you think you're a fucking gross monster
3170440	3174440	and like, like, and then you click on the first thing and you see an egg and you see
3174440	3178440	like two followers, but like it's on Instagram that it's always like locked.
3178440	3185440	It's always like a person that talks shit because they're terrified that you would
3185440	3187440	get, which I used to do.
3187440	3191440	I would just go to someone's thing if it wasn't locked and I would just go through every fucking
3191440	3192440	Instagram for three years ago.
3192440	3194440	Like your dog sucks.
3194440	3196440	Like who cares that you went to St. Louis?
3196440	3198440	Did that make you feel as less of a loser?
3198440	3200440	Fucking like, like nice cabbage.
3200440	3201440	Did you grow it yourself?
3201440	3202440	It must hate you.
3202440	3207440	Like, uh, just go through every single picture from their entire life and just like comment
3207440	3208440	on it.
3208440	3209440	Yeah.
3209440	3210440	We've been pretty lucky with, with trolls.
3210440	3213440	We don't have that many trolls, but when we do, occasionally I lose my mind.
3213440	3217440	Um, cause again, I'm not really part of the account, but I, I run them all, but every
3217440	3221440	once in a while someone will be like, you know, whatever the fuck they say.
3221440	3227440	And then you inevitably click on their account and it's very rare that it's like, I'm a dermatologist.
3227440	3229440	Here's my Patagonia.
3229440	3230440	Proud father.
3230440	3231440	Yeah.
3231440	3235440	I mean, I love my beautiful kids and you know, we were just spearfishing in Indonesia and
3235440	3240440	it's usually a, you know, a follow ratio of 55 people following them and 5,000 people
3240440	3243440	that they're following and just one fucking photo of a pancake or something.
3243440	3244440	Yeah.
3244440	3245440	A photo of a telephone pole or something.
3245440	3246440	Yeah.
3246440	3250440	Um, but you know, I also find that people aren't really taking into consideration.
3250440	3254440	You know, they're not sort of, I have this thing in my phone cause I'm, you know, somewhat
3254440	3259440	like you like just terribly reactive that says pause and give constructive feedback and I
3259440	3260440	ignore that every time.
3260440	3263440	Um, and I never pause and I never give constructive feedback.
3263440	3265440	Do you respond to like trolls?
3265440	3269440	Every once in a while I will drop a bomb on a troll for fun.
3269440	3271440	What's sad about it is like, you know, it's all in good fun.
3271440	3275440	And then you'll actually see other people getting involved.
3275440	3277440	What's the stuff that gets under your skin?
3277440	3278440	Is it the fake thing?
3278440	3283440	The fake stuff is annoying because it's like, it's really just, it's someone, you know,
3283440	3284440	treating Instagram like Twitter.
3284440	3285440	Yeah.
3285440	3289440	I'm really sorry that I took part in that, but I also want to say that because that's
3289440	3292440	what I think is important message to you that I learned.
3292440	3297440	And then I said in that comment is that now I understand because I saw people like calling
3297440	3298440	out that one that was like so believable.
3298440	3299440	I'm like, okay.
3299440	3305440	I think like I, people that say this stuff to me, I never believe them, but maybe you'll
3305440	3306440	hear it from me.
3306440	3310440	I truly believe that the people that say this is fake.
3310440	3311440	This is fake.
3311440	3313440	They're expressing a love of your content.
3313440	3315440	They're, they're so hooked in.
3315440	3320440	They're getting, I can speak for that personally that the, when I did that, when I said like,
3320440	3325440	this one's fake, the reason I did that is because of the respect that I have for the
3326440	3328440	institution and you could easily.
3328440	3331440	You might feel that way, but I think to a lot of people, it's just another meme account.
3331440	3335440	You know, they don't have context and they're just looking at, you know, whatever's on Instagram.
3335440	3336440	Yeah.
3336440	3341440	I mean, I tell, look, I, look, I hate people that say look, look, I was grabbing you by
3341440	3348440	the scruff of your brain and I, but, but, but I, I, I, I think the vast majority, I think,
3348440	3353440	I think you've got, I think we're 80 to 90% in the garden that people like to visit and
3353440	3354440	stuff.
3354440	3357440	And like, I think that would like, I'm telling you, I love it.
3357440	3359440	And I was an asshole.
3359440	3363440	I was, I was like, I didn't even think about until after I clicked, I was like, I thought
3363440	3368440	that I was like helping something like, like, like you have a beautiful tomato garden.
3368440	3369440	I'm like, this one's rotten or so.
3369440	3371440	I don't even know what I was thinking.
3371440	3372440	Yeah.
3372440	3373440	And I'm sure there is one that's rotten.
3373440	3377440	Like there's no doubt that someone has sent something in and you know, I've literally
3377440	3379440	asked them as like, Oh, where'd you hear that?
3379440	3382440	And they're like, in my mind, you know what I mean?
3383440	3384440	I was like, that doesn't work.
3384440	3388440	And today we got, you know, something really funny from Detroit, you know, and I'm like,
3388440	3389440	well, it's really funny.
3389440	3390440	Like, that's good content.
3390440	3391440	Do we not post it?
3391440	3394440	Because you know how honorable meme account people are.
3394440	3399440	I'm sure like all the other meme account people that are like 23 year old, like, you know,
3399440	3405440	like, you know, whatever, something smart, you would say, fill in the blank, you know,
3405440	3406440	have that.
3406440	3410440	There's no scruples and they troll Instagram and they, you know, grab content from this
3410440	3412440	person and that person and repurpose it as their own.
3412440	3417440	And we try to have integrity, you know, in this ridiculous, you know, mini mall that
3417440	3419440	we're in of content.
3419440	3421440	But yeah, I'm sure we've been tricked.
3421440	3425440	You know, I'm sure like something from season seven, episode five of The Mindy
3425440	3427440	Show got on there and we deleted it quickly.
3427440	3429440	But yeah, I appreciate your respect.
3429440	3433440	Every time, like every time I'll think about, oh, that's really that's a great play on
3433440	3434440	words.
3434440	3438440	That's that's that's that's a funny little thought like idea and type it all up, make
3438440	3443440	it a perfect crafted tweet or whatever or caption to an Instagram thing or whatever.
3443440	3445440	And then I go, you know, I'm just to be safe.
3445440	3446440	I'm going to I'm going to Google that.
3446440	3450440	I'm going to type it in as is with quotes around Twitter, Google or Google, Google,
3450440	3451440	Twitter.
3451440	3455440	And and it's already been done a thousand times.
3455440	3459440	And so one time I wrote some dumb joke, like so very low hanging fruit, like something
3459440	3460440	was in the news or whatever.
3460440	3464440	And I just wrote something and like it's so much like a nice ripoff of Jim Gaffigan,
3464440	3465440	bro.
3465440	3467440	Like I don't fucking listen to Jim Gaffigan.
3467440	3468440	Fuck you.
3468440	3474440	When I have a Jim Gaffigan, when I have an idea like that, some family and your happiness
3474440	3476440	lately, I've just been starting.
3476440	3477440	I'll Twitter, Google it.
3477440	3482440	And then instead of just posting my joke, I'll just post a screenshot of the whole search.
3482440	3486440	And so you have like a bunch of people's half-assed attempts at the same kind of area.
3486440	3490440	And that makes me feel so much better because it's like, I don't know if I could have done
3490440	3492440	a better job than this, but it definitely wasn't good.
3492440	3493440	And neither are these people.
3493440	3494440	So just look at that instead.
3495440	3496440	There you go.
3496440	3497440	I like that.
3497440	3501440	Yeah, we get the same submission like probably three, four times a week for the last three
3501440	3502440	years.
3502440	3504440	And I'm just always...
3504440	3506440	It's just one that you can...
3506440	3507440	Well, no, I mean, we...
3507440	3508440	Oh.
3508440	3509440	I'm sort of figuring out that you're the entire...
3509440	3514440	They say a man in New York, every 30 seconds, a man gets mugged in New York.
3514440	3516440	We're about to meet that man.
3516440	3517440	Anyway, sorry.
3517440	3520440	You're like, for the last three years you've been getting the same submission every day.
3521440	3523440	It's just you and your writing team sending shit in.
3523440	3528440	Is there an overheard LA thing that is actually one that just keeps coming in like month after
3528440	3529440	month the same exact way?
3529440	3530440	Yeah, yeah.
3530440	3531440	Sorry.
3531440	3532440	That's what I meant.
3532440	3534440	We have an unpostable submission that we've never posted that is the stupidest shit ever
3534440	3535440	that everyone...
3535440	3538440	And it's just basically going up to a valet parker and they're like, do you need to be
3538440	3539440	validated?
3539440	3540440	Oh, right.
3540440	3541440	And then it's just like...
3541440	3542440	Yeah.
3542440	3543440	But it probably is.
3543440	3545440	I mean, because having been to a...
3545440	3547440	Every time someone says, do you need validation?
3547440	3548440	Yeah.
3549440	3556440	I've been here 25 years and I've blocked out how many times I might have...
3556440	3557440	Yeah.
3557440	3565440	For the first two years, I've convinced myself I never did go like, just do the wordplay
3565440	3566440	response.
3566440	3567440	Do I need validation?
3567440	3568440	Well, I...
3568440	3571440	Yeah, but at least a more intelligent version of that where you expand on the validation
3571440	3574440	you need related to your horrible experience.
3574440	3576440	The other thing that occurred to me earlier is that...
3576440	3583440	That's the thing about LA especially is that you do have a bunch of people at any given
3583440	3590440	time, like how many improv buddies are sitting at the table, three tables from you who are
3590440	3596440	like actually quite witty and dry and kind of performing almost like when they...
3596440	3600440	Like writing a time travel movie at Starbucks in Van Nuys.
3600440	3601440	Yeah.
3601440	3608440	And also just one foot in and one foot out of themselves because they're just funny people
3608440	3609440	and they're kind of like...
3609440	3617440	That's why I would buy that LA overheard quotes are marginally more unbelievable than on average
3617440	3621440	because you could be listening to just a group of people that are...
3621440	3622440	100%.
3622440	3624440	And then you have the whole parenting part.
3624440	3631440	You have the absurdity of children raising children with phones and iPads.
3631440	3636440	And one of the best ones we ever had was like two kids at Pan Pacific Park and there was
3636440	3638440	like, go hide and text me when you're ready.
3638440	3641440	And it's just like...
3641440	3642440	Oh, that's terrible.
3642440	3645440	But I mean, why wouldn't that happen?
3645440	3646440	You know what I mean?
3646440	3647440	That's a real one?
3647440	3648440	Oh, my God.
3648440	3649440	Yeah, that's fucking awesome.
3649440	3650440	Yeah.
3650440	3651440	I mean, that fucking just hurts the soul.
3651440	3652440	That was me and Dan at the park.
3652440	3653440	It's better than counting.
3653440	3654440	Dismal.
3654440	3656440	Text me when you're ready.
3656440	3657440	Fuck off.
3657440	3660440	I should have made a list of my favorite ones, but I did not.
3660440	3662440	You didn't bring a list of like hits, did you?
3662440	3664440	I mean, I could just real...
3664440	3666440	You probably got them in your little head.
3666440	3667440	I'm sorry.
3667440	3668440	I said your head was little.
3668440	3669440	It's in his phone.
3669440	3670440	It's an Instagram account.
3670440	3672440	Talking about my head like it's economy.
3672440	3674440	It's a Delta head.
3674440	3677440	I went, I don't want Delta miles.
3677440	3679440	Go through your phone and text us when you have a good one.
3679440	3685440	Well, I don't want to distract you with this question, but...
3685440	3686440	Sorry, I'm on Instagram, bro.
3686440	3687440	What?
3687440	3689440	I'll field this one.
3689440	3694440	Let's check in with Spencer while Jesse goes through and finds some of his favorites.
3694440	3696440	I just meant for you to ask the question I put to me.
3696440	3697440	I can reel them off, but anyway.
3697440	3698440	Oh, okay.
3698440	3699440	Well, all right.
3699440	3700440	Reel them off, then.
3700440	3702440	Give us some content.
3702440	3704440	I like a lot of the short ones.
3704440	3707440	Like, you know, I need to cancel my threesome.
3708440	3712440	You know, it's a good one that was sort of verified reel and the people that got
3712440	3715440	overheard like wrote in saying like, oh, my God, that was me.
3715440	3718440	And I really did have a threesome and I couldn't make it.
3720440	3725440	To interject on that, I was at a bar one time and there was these three like
3725440	3727440	well-dressed, like kind of like clubby kind of chicks.
3727440	3730440	And they were having a drink as the three of clubs.
3730440	3734440	And they were just talking and shooting the breeze and another girl joins them.
3734440	3736440	It's like, oh, what a day.
3736440	3739440	Like, it's like fucking I forget the guy's name.
3739440	3740440	I say his name was Anthony.
3740440	3742440	Just Anthony just destroyed my asshole.
3742440	3745440	Like he just fucking just destroyed my asshole.
3745440	3746440	I said, oh, yeah, he'll do that.
3746440	3749440	And they're like, yeah, we all tell me about it.
3750440	3755440	Looking back on what they must be porn actresses because like they're in a cult.
3755440	3757440	They just clocked out.
3757440	3759440	They're like, oh, boy.
3759440	3760440	Fucking.
3760440	3761440	Just did 30 minutes with Anthony.
3761440	3762440	Yeah, fuck it.
3762440	3764440	Just the outtakes alone.
3767440	3769440	He never gets it in one.
3769440	3771440	You always got to fucking all the reshoots with Anthony in that.
3771440	3773440	He never gets it in one.
3778440	3780440	He always puts it in two.
3780440	3782440	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3782440	3784440	Yeah, because he's fucking your asshole.
3784440	3785440	Yes.
3786440	3789440	All right.
3789440	3790440	Well, let's hear.
3790440	3794440	I mean, that would make the account like that is that is more than worthy.
3794440	3796440	Overheard on porn sets would could be a thing.
3796440	3797440	So good.
3797440	3798440	Yeah.
3798440	3803440	I think one one I was a good one from a long time ago was the amount of coke
3803440	3806440	he gave me did not equal the amount of head I gave him.
3806440	3811440	Oh, so, you know, if it's about if it's about immediate reciprocity, man,
3811440	3813440	it's not about the fun anymore.
3813440	3815440	You got to do it because you like it.
3815440	3818440	I don't know what recompense means, but there's probably a job.
3818440	3821440	I just say things louder.
3827440	3828440	You know what?
3828440	3831440	If you're going to be that honest, you're welcome to stay.
3831440	3835440	We got a real peak behind the curtain on that one.
3835440	3841440	I'm shocked you handed that algorithm over putting yourself out of business.
3842440	3845440	That's so bashful about it.
3851440	3855440	It's like if T-Pain was like, there's an auto tune.
3858440	3861440	But by the way, that's a derail.
3861440	3865440	But T-Pain most famously now like he went on the singer thing.
3865440	3867440	And it's like it's like that.
3867440	3868440	It was shrub.
3868440	3869440	You went to art school.
3870440	3873440	Those Picasso guys and the Van Gogh guys that make the scribble dudes
3873440	3875440	and it looks like a kid drew it.
3875440	3879440	But they can all like actually they could draw Benjamin Franklin if they wanted.
3879440	3883440	Yeah, Picasso was a very, very gifted artist.
3883440	3885440	T-Pain uses all that auto tune.
3885440	3888440	But if he wanted to, he could sound like Luther Vandross.
3888440	3890440	He could sound like fucking anybody.
3890440	3893440	He fucking dominated that masked singer thing.
3893440	3895440	It's like nobody knew it was him.
3895440	3897440	And he's like, isn't that crazy?
3898440	3901440	I just can't believe that like I felt good that you followed over at LA
3901440	3903440	and now that you watch the masked singer.
3903440	3905440	I don't watch the masked singer, but I follow T-Pain.
3905440	3906440	Do you follow his...
3906440	3907440	I love T-Pain.
3907440	3910440	Do you follow his live tweeting of Game of Thrones?
3910440	3911440	No, no.
3911440	3912440	It's fucking poetry.
3912440	3913440	Well, I'm not on Twitter.
3913440	3916440	I just, it's too much of a net loss for me.
3916440	3919440	Yeah, but just get someone else's account just for Sunday nights.
3919440	3920440	And he's just, yeah, well...
3920440	3923440	Man, I wonder if he's LA based.
3923440	3926440	Because if he's like, man, I bet I could get in there.
3926440	3927440	I think he's really shy.
3927440	3928440	I bet I could get in there.
3928440	3930440	He's a big Rick and Morty fan.
3930440	3935440	Like beyond like, oh Chance the Rapper likes Rick and Morty.
3935440	3938440	It's like T-Pain fucking like for his birthday,
3938440	3940440	his wife like made him a Rick and Morty cake.
3940440	3943440	Like he's like, he's really into Rick and Morty.
3943440	3947440	And I'm always trying to get Wisconsin swag from him
3947440	3948440	because I'm from Wisconsin.
3948440	3951440	Yeah, they only had one like run of all that stuff
3951440	3952440	and then they stopped selling it.
3952440	3953440	Sorry, I derailed us completely.
3953440	3954440	I know.
3954440	3955440	Please.
3955440	3956440	I love T-Pain's Instagram.
3956440	3960440	I mean, you got like the thing happening right now is,
3960440	3962440	I mean, I can't see anything,
3962440	3965440	but is anyone familiar with his Game of Thrones?
3965440	3966440	Oh, yeah.
3966440	3970440	T-Pain screaming at Aria like live tweeting now.
3970440	3974440	Wait, so do you watch it live as you're watching the show?
3974440	3976440	I don't interact with Twitter when I'm,
3976440	3979440	I don't know what live tweeting is or how people do that,
3979440	3984440	but I will go back and I will watch his sort of reactions
3984440	3985440	to Game of Thrones.
3985440	3986440	That sounds fun.
3986440	3987440	I like that.
3987440	3988440	And it is fucking amazing.
3988440	3989440	Yeah.
3989440	3990440	I mean, that was the big,
3990440	3992440	that was the tweet about the tweeting,
3992440	3995440	but it makes me miss Twitter the most is a Game of Thrones tweet,
3995440	3996440	which is like,
3996440	3998440	it was a live tweet where you're watching Game of Thrones
3998440	4000440	and then somebody's tweet went kind of viral,
4000440	4002440	whatever you, I don't know,
4002440	4005440	got the ratio hit that gap, whatever you say.
4005440	4006440	It's this tweet,
4006440	4008440	I got through the roof while everyone's watching Game of Thrones.
4008440	4009440	They're like,
4009440	4010440	did everybody see this tweet that someone tweeted
4010440	4011440	while they're watching Game of Thrones,
4011440	4013440	which was like, oh, here comes.
4013440	4014440	Yeah.
4014440	4015440	What's his name?
4015440	4016440	Jura.
4016440	4017440	When he appears on the,
4017440	4020440	he shows up and he's not supposed to follow.
4020440	4022440	And he shows up on the,
4022440	4024440	on the gladiator arena.
4024440	4025440	Who wrote that?
4025440	4026440	Oh, great.
4026440	4030440	Here comes Lord Jura from house friend zone.
4030440	4031440	It's just such a great,
4031440	4033440	like what a great peak moment of like,
4033440	4038440	it just represents for me as of the added Glee of you as a role player.
4038440	4039440	Like it's like,
4039440	4041440	who would have ever thunk that?
4041440	4042440	I mean,
4042440	4045440	that's just a great byproduct of all the shitty things.
4045440	4048440	The world is into fucking dragons and stuff,
4048440	4049440	like the whole world.
4049440	4051440	So like, you know, like people are just like,
4051440	4052440	I mean, yes,
4052440	4053440	bring your,
4053440	4055440	bring your friend zone antics to,
4055440	4058440	to our D and D milieu.
4058440	4059440	Uh, right.
4059440	4060440	Well, I mean, well, no,
4060440	4063440	but like I watched Game of Thrones last night.
4063440	4066440	I'm four episodes behind and I haven't watched Atlanta yet.
4066440	4067440	Okay. Well, I mean,
4067440	4071440	I'm not revealing without revealing any spoilers from the largest.
4071440	4072440	Well, I heard they had the battle of Winterfell.
4072440	4075440	So yeah, apparently I know the Weight Walkers one, right?
4075440	4076440	Yep.
4076440	4078440	And so the rest of the season is just going to be them going like,
4078440	4081440	where's my skeleton horse?
4081440	4084440	Who borrowed my skeleton horse?
4084440	4086440	Who bought it?
4086440	4091440	You go on Twitter after and just kill another horse, Gary.
4091440	4093440	It's not, that's not the point.
4093440	4096440	I rode that horse till it died.
4096440	4098440	It's my skeleton horse.
4098440	4100440	Oh, so it is property now.
4100440	4103440	Maybe we should build a wall.
4103440	4105440	Sorry. I continue.
4105440	4106440	It's just like,
4106440	4108440	it's the rest of this is like the batter.
4108440	4109440	Okay.
4109440	4110440	The anyway,
4110440	4112440	like the rest is like six episodes left of Game of Thrones.
4112440	4116440	It's just the Weight Walkers arguing.
4116440	4117440	Yeah.
4117440	4118440	They break up into factions.
4118440	4119440	They're like,
4119440	4121440	I'm going to be a desert weight walker.
4121440	4124440	Fine. We'll call you.
4124440	4126440	Yeah. What are the weird priest?
4126440	4128440	What were you going to call him?
4128440	4130440	I don't know.
4130440	4132440	We call him what?
4132440	4133440	He's a walker.
4133440	4134440	Okay, cool.
4134440	4135440	Go ahead.
4135440	4140440	I want to make a baby's eyes blue with my icicle finger.
4140440	4148440	How come Steve always gets to make baby's eyes blue with his icicle finger?
4148440	4151440	This is Weight Walker infighting.
4151440	4156440	It's the hashtag that you might want to use when you're celebrating the bit that I coined.
4156440	4158440	You know Rob,
4158440	4162440	Dan has a sketch he's working on because they're bringing Mad TV back.
4162440	4167440	And one of his characters for Mad TV that Dan was going to do on his audition is,
4167440	4170440	Dan, can I tell your character?
4170440	4171440	Yeah.
4171440	4173440	Rob and Spencer.
4173440	4175440	It's very sporting of you, Dan.
4175440	4176440	It's the coach.
4176440	4179440	It's a pregame pep talk for the White Walkers.
4179440	4186440	And this is the coach of the White Walkers getting the White Walkers ready to go into the big game.
4186440	4190440	What are the White Walkers?
4190440	4191440	You'll find out. You'll find out in the sketch.
4191440	4193440	The sketch kind of lays it all out there for you.
4193440	4196440	All right, then.
4196440	4201440	I don't know if they could have made that show starting this year and just named,
4201440	4206440	you know, the All White Cast and then the White Walkers and then the Whites.
4206440	4210440	White privilege, but it's called W-I-G-H-T.
4210440	4212440	Oh my God, the Whites are coming.
4212440	4218440	No, I mean, it's shocking how resonant it got with the walls and the Whites and the walking.
4218440	4219440	Yeah.
4219440	4222440	I mean, it got so retroactively applicable.
4222440	4225440	It was like, guys, bigger fish to fry here.
4225440	4229440	Stop arguing about whether or not the blah blah blah.
4229440	4230440	All right.
4230440	4231440	All right.
4231440	4234440	Well, I have to yes and Jeff's thing.
4234440	4240440	This is White Walker.
4240440	4242440	Oh, okay.
4242440	4246440	White Walker coach at halftime.
4246440	4254440	Oh, gentlemen.
4254440	4259440	Where do I start?
4259440	4268440	We came here to enslave humanity and bind it in a magical frost.
4268440	4270440	I don't know if that's true.
4270440	4274440	I don't know what their goal is.
4274440	4275440	Yardage.
4275440	4278440	It's all about yardage.
4278440	4283440	I don't think you understand who you are.
4284440	4291440	I'm seeing you White.
4291440	4298440	And I haven't seen a single one of you walk.
4298440	4303440	You may think that you've walked from wildling territory to Winterfell.
4303440	4308440	You may think that you've walked across ice and fallen through it.
4309440	4312440	You may think that you've risen,
4312440	4316440	that you've screamed and run full speed at your former friends,
4316440	4318440	confusing them,
4318440	4321440	taking advantage of their mortal familiarities
4321440	4325440	as you bit into their rib cages,
4325440	4328440	swelling our ranks.
4328440	4334440	Before I'm standing, you ain't done shit.
4334440	4337440	My skin is blue.
4337440	4339440	I have a crown of ice.
4339440	4343440	I ride a skeleton horse.
4343440	4348440	And right now I'd like to roll over and die.
4348440	4355440	I wish I could go to Dorn and drink a wine cooler.
4355440	4363440	You call what you're doing out there white walking?
4364440	4366440	Let's just quit right now.
4366440	4367440	It's not too late.
4367440	4370440	Let's white walk back to the south.
4370440	4373440	Let's just hang out and fucking do whatever we want.
4373440	4376440	We'll roll around in the snow.
4376440	4384440	We'll let Peter Dinklage and the lady from Terminator 4 hang out.
4384440	4387440	They can advise each other.
4387440	4390440	They can consult with their hands and their kings,
4390440	4399440	make their fire water in their fucking dragon eggs museums.
4399440	4407440	Or you can suck it up and get cold.
4407440	4410440	Now, what's it going to be?
4410440	4412440	Mmm.
4412440	4415440	Excuse me?
4415440	4416440	All right, come on, Jeff.
4416440	4419440	I did the best I could.
4419440	4421440	Yay.
4421440	4423440	Yeah.
4423440	4427440	Yeah, I know, I know, sarcasm.
4427440	4428440	No, it was good.
4428440	4429440	No, shut up.
4429440	4430440	No, it was good.
4430440	4432440	I won't watch any of the season.
4432440	4438440	All right, Jesse, give us some more overheard LA classic.
4438440	4443440	Boy, hmm.
4443440	4445440	Just give us a stinger.
4445440	4446440	Give us a good one.
4446440	4448440	Give you a dinger.
4448440	4451440	Can we find your submission?
4451440	4452440	Yeah, yeah.
4452440	4453440	Let's find it.
4453440	4454440	If you can, yeah.
4454440	4455440	Yeah.
4455440	4456440	What's your Instagram?
4456440	4457440	Dan Harmon.
4457440	4458440	White Walker 85.
4458440	4461440	Where?
4461440	4462440	Daniel.
4462440	4465440	Wait, is that the Leslie Arfin one you already told us about?
4465440	4466440	Yeah, that's the one.
4466440	4468440	Yeah, I can't remember it.
4468440	4469440	It's not good.
4469440	4472440	I mean, yeah, it's going to humiliate me.
4472440	4475440	I have the chucky cheese of wireless carriers.
4475440	4476440	Oh, yeah.
4477440	4479440	The signal's no good here.
4479440	4480440	Sorry.
4480440	4483440	I mean, you know, we only dated for 11 Instagrams.
4483440	4485440	That was an all time favorite.
4485440	4488440	Yeah, I mean, that's the name of the book that you came up with.
4488440	4490440	Yeah, we did a book, which we're not here to talk about,
4490440	4492440	but we only dated for 11 Instagrams.
4492440	4493440	You're anti-plugging your book.
4493440	4494440	Yeah.
4494440	4495440	But you're excited about your newspaper.
4495440	4497440	Yeah, we just launched a newspaper a couple weeks ago
4497440	4498440	because digital's dead.
4498440	4500440	Yeah.
4500440	4502440	Yeah, real life is coming back.
4502440	4503440	A newspaper, what do you mean?
4503440	4505440	We launched a local newspaper.
4505440	4509440	We made about 12,000 of them, and they were in like 50 locations.
4509440	4513440	Like sort of down to earth, you know, like blue collar spots,
4513440	4519440	like intelligentsia and air wand and, you know,
4519440	4521440	Verve coffee and things like that.
4521440	4524440	But, you know, it's sort of like Instagramable on the outside with,
4524440	4526440	you know, bits by comedy writers on the inside.
4526440	4531440	We had a millennial weather report with Earth's current mood.
4532440	4536440	We had like comic strips with, you know, Instagram artists.
4536440	4540440	So obviously comparisons to The Onion are going to arise here.
4540440	4543440	Yeah, so we tried, you know, we're never going to touch The Onion.
4543440	4544440	It's, you know, one of the greatest things ever.
4544440	4547440	It was sort of half satire and half editorial we had.
4547440	4548440	That would be a good masthead.
4548440	4549440	Never going to touch The Onion.
4549440	4552440	Yeah, never going to touch The Onion.
4552440	4555440	And it would be a good T-Pain song.
4556440	4561440	Never, never going to touch The Onion.
4564440	4565440	Continue.
4566440	4570440	Yeah, we had a vegan go to animal, the nose to tail spot on it.
4570440	4571440	Fairfax.
4571440	4573440	So it was nose to tail spots.
4573440	4575440	I seriously, you talk like this all the time.
4575440	4576440	It's a nose to tail spot.
4576440	4577440	I do.
4577440	4581440	I assume what that is, is like you eat all of the entire Chinatown.
4581440	4583440	But for white people, yeah.
4584440	4588440	Is the appeal of it that you're somehow being like more tastefully carnivorous
4588440	4590440	because you're actually eating the entire animal?
4590440	4592440	Or is that, is that a thing?
4592440	4593440	Well, I think it's more sort of conscious.
4593440	4597440	Like, you know, if you're, you know, if you're a hunter and you eat something,
4597440	4600440	like you're making the most of the animal, you're not letting any of it go to waste.
4600440	4601440	Right.
4601440	4603440	But I mean, if you sit at a table, is it like, are they like,
4603440	4605440	do they come over and go welcome to nose to tail?
4605440	4606440	Do you know how it works here?
4606440	4609440	No, I've never actually said nose to tail out loud.
4609440	4612440	I have read it, but I think it's just, you know,
4612440	4614440	places where you can get, you know, pigs feet or.
4614440	4615440	Okay.
4615440	4617440	So it's, it's, it's, it's about the volume of offering.
4617440	4620440	They just use, they use the whole animal creatively.
4620440	4623440	But yeah, we had a vegan go there and sort of do a review.
4625440	4627440	So, you know, yeah, it's, it's fun.
4627440	4628440	We're launching into New York.
4628440	4631440	We're looking forward to your white Walker advice column.
4633440	4635440	That was the most recent project.
4635440	4639440	When you turn a baby's eyes blue with your icicle finger,
4639440	4642440	you've got to be careful not to, not to kill the baby.
4643440	4648440	I mean, you want to kill it to the extent that it becomes a white Walker.
4650440	4653440	Anyways, did you know that it's white walkers?
4653440	4656440	The white walkers is like the color white and Walker.
4656440	4659440	And then the, but then the, the, the people that are in charge,
4659440	4661440	like the Rob Schwab looking guys that are in charge of all the,
4661440	4662440	they're, they're blue.
4662440	4666440	They all look like Rob Schwab, by the way, the, the, um,
4667440	4671440	the main guy does not his like weird priest horseman, but, but the main guy.
4671440	4674440	I think they all look like trap, but so do all the hell raisers,
4674440	4677440	all the hell raisers look like not just pinhead.
4677440	4681440	I think they look like a crew of methods who listen to blink 182 and like
4681440	4682440	live in Santa Clarita.
4682440	4686440	Like they'll have long coats, electrical tape, like matrix gowns on.
4686440	4688440	Yeah. Yeah. And they look like that guy.
4688440	4690440	I think he recently passed away, but he was like, you know,
4690440	4691440	twisted fire starter.
4691440	4694440	Like that guy kind of sort of looks like that guy.
4694440	4696440	I just, I hate that their origins,
4696440	4698440	I'm excited that the battle of Winterfell happened,
4698440	4700440	which I assume is white walkers versus mortals.
4700440	4703440	And then I'm like, I, I'm not, I haven't seen what happens.
4703440	4704440	Okay.
4704440	4706440	John snow just destroys Sansa's ass and it's like,
4706440	4709440	dude, he destroyed my ass.
4709440	4711440	It was such a snog.
4711440	4712440	Yeah.
4713440	4714440	Um,
4714440	4715440	your submission.
4715440	4717440	Yeah. I already heard that.
4717440	4719440	Like Aria, wait, wait, what's her name?
4719440	4720440	Are Aria Aria.
4720440	4721440	Yeah.
4721440	4722440	I heard that.
4722440	4723440	Spoiler alert.
4723440	4724440	An early, yeah.
4724440	4729440	And an early event has witnessed to her coming of age.
4731440	4733440	Yeah. My friend screamed when that happened.
4733440	4736440	He's a 49 year old writer,
4736440	4741440	a successful screenwriter and we were watching a group of like 15 and she
4741440	4742440	sort of, you know,
4742440	4745440	started to take her pants off and they did like just one little shot of the
4745440	4746440	top eighth of her butt.
4746440	4749440	And he was like, I've known you since you were a little girl.
4749440	4750440	Yeah, exactly.
4750440	4753440	It just seems like I just picture, like I picture these living rooms full of
4753440	4757440	people with white wine and like all this silence and you just hear crackling
4757440	4759440	fireplace and, and, and, and panting.
4759440	4764440	And then one 48 year old, uh, uh, uh, person goes like, go girl.
4765440	4768440	And then everyone's like, okay, I guess this is happening. Yeah.
4768440	4769440	Get it.
4771440	4773440	Cause I don't know how it would process that.
4773440	4774440	It doesn't feel like we raised her.
4774440	4775440	Yeah.
4775440	4776440	Like she's,
4776440	4777440	but you haven't seen the actual scene.
4777440	4778440	No, I haven't.
4778440	4780440	I haven't seen this entire season or Atlanta.
4780440	4784440	I, I, I, I, I, I, Cody's not, I don't want to, I don't want to,
4784440	4787440	it's got Cody's Cody's, you know, it's like, it's like,
4787440	4790440	unless Cody and I are both like gung ho about something,
4790440	4792440	it probably won't happen at all.
4792440	4797440	Just like, and so Cody and I are both at any given time are not like,
4797440	4798440	Oh, fucking Thrones.
4798440	4799440	Let's do it.
4799440	4802440	And it's not because I, it's because I know that they're wrapping it up.
4802440	4804440	I mean, I think it was one of the greatest series in the history of
4804440	4805440	television, but it's like,
4805440	4808440	it's a serialized series and it's about all these like cataclysmic events
4808440	4812440	like coming, you know, it's like, so I just have some of the worst acting of
4812440	4813440	all time as well.
4813440	4816440	Now, like, who do you think, who do you think are the bad actors on it?
4816440	4818440	Well, I mean, I can't act, but like,
4818440	4821440	I feel like a lot of the great actors, you know, already dead.
4821440	4824440	Like, you know, Tywin Lannister, Charles dance was amazing.
4824440	4827440	The Tyrell grandmother.
4827440	4828440	She was great.
4828440	4829440	She was amazing.
4829440	4831440	Tyrion in season one was the greatest actor ever.
4831440	4833440	And now he's just sort of like walks around and he's like,
4833440	4834440	where's my accent?
4834440	4835440	And how do I?
4835440	4838440	Shots fired.
4838440	4839440	Yeah.
4839440	4840440	I mean, I don't know.
4840440	4844440	I just love, I love, I guess it's sort of like, like David Mamet movies
4844440	4849440	where it's like, like, well, who cares if Campbell Scott, like is,
4849440	4852440	it's like, obviously David Mamet's like, get me Campbell Scott.
4852440	4856440	And that is like, Campbell, do that thing where you stare straight ahead
4856440	4858440	and read all of my dialogue.
4858440	4860440	Every word matters.
4860440	4861440	Okay.
4862440	4863440	We're going to do another take.
4863440	4865440	You moved your eyebrow once.
4865440	4867440	It distracts from my words.
4867440	4868440	Go.
4868440	4871440	More Campbell, less Scott.
4871440	4874440	And he kind of like has his wheelhouse of like actors.
4874440	4878440	Because I feel like when I watch Game of Thrones, I'm like,
4878440	4881440	I don't care if they, if they have their scripts out, you know,
4881440	4882440	they're doing like a table.
4882440	4884440	I mean, it's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen.
4884440	4887440	But it's also like one of those cultural moments now where you're actually
4887440	4891440	like, I walked into work and one of my colleagues had not watched it.
4891440	4892440	You know, she's a big fan.
4892440	4893440	And I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?
4893440	4896440	Like, there's no spoiler alert time here.
4896440	4900440	Like everyone's freaking out because killed.
4900440	4901440	Right.
4901440	4904440	And it reminds me of that.
4904440	4905440	Yeah.
4905440	4909440	Like Rob Stark's ghost kills ghost.
4909440	4910440	The dog.
4910440	4912440	But it reminds me of the Sopranos or, you know, like,
4912440	4915440	like when will there be epic television like this where everyone's sort of on
4915440	4918440	board and watching Trump is the only other thing.
4918440	4919440	Truly.
4919440	4921440	And I think we've talked about this like every,
4921440	4925440	every year with HBO, cause it was sort of like the streak of,
4925440	4928440	and it was like, what's the secret over there?
4928440	4930440	Which executive is bringing the magic?
4930440	4934440	And there, and, but now I think we can truly say we're,
4934440	4935440	you're not going to,
4935440	4940440	there's going to be the end of this HBO era of prestige television
4940440	4943440	because of the AT&T buying everything.
4943440	4947440	And like, they're going to merge HBO with like a bunch of shit and just
4947440	4948440	call it HBO.
4948440	4951440	And that's what my old boss, Bob Greenblatt is going to be in charge of.
4951440	4953440	And I don't, I just don't see that.
4953440	4954440	Like I, there,
4954440	4958440	there's no longer going to be this like weird little cottage where they,
4958440	4961440	they, they would buy these things where they're like,
4961440	4963440	that sounds like a crazy idea.
4963440	4965440	But if you invested a bunch of money in it,
4965440	4967440	it was like a weird world to build.
4967440	4969440	Like, when are we ever going to see any of these crazy, like,
4969440	4971440	Where's Creepshow going to air Rob?
4971440	4972440	Shutter.
4972440	4973440	Shutter.
4973440	4974440	Maybe that's the new thing.
4974440	4975440	Maybe that's the new thing.
4975440	4976440	I'm sure that's the new thing.
4976440	4978440	First and 10, the Bulls mean business.
4978440	4983440	But then you see what's coming out and it's like Westworld and his dark
4983440	4986440	materials and they're doing deadwood.
4986440	4987440	Like, yeah,
4987440	4989440	maybe that's two, three years from now.
4989440	4992440	Well, that's, that's stuff that they've already gotten the pipe.
4992440	4995440	I'm saying like, who's who I'm talking about.
4995440	4997440	It's going to be over after that.
4997440	5000440	It is like the deadwood movie and all the stuff.
5000440	5001440	It's like, it's kind of the end.
5001440	5004440	It's an end of, I don't know, 20, 30 years?
5004440	5005440	What is it?
5005440	5011440	Like, HBO making this amazing stuff where like they're only,
5011440	5013440	and just when you think they're going to zig,
5013440	5015440	they zag kind of thing where they're, you know,
5015440	5018440	they don't go like, well, we love mafia stories.
5018440	5020440	So let's buy three more Sopranos things.
5020440	5023440	They just like, obviously, they have like,
5023440	5025440	they had like this taste over there where they're like,
5025440	5028440	as long as you create a world for me that I'm interested in,
5028440	5030440	I want to be immersed in and like,
5030440	5033440	what other network is ever going to provide that environment
5033440	5037440	for some of the craziest like writers?
5037440	5038440	True TV.
5038440	5039440	It's about it.
5039440	5040440	True TV.
5040440	5042440	And I think that's it.
5042440	5043440	Anyways.
5043440	5044440	All right.
5044440	5045440	Moving on.
5045440	5049440	Getting into the leg of the show where I'm too drunk to be entertaining.
5049440	5052440	Not that the first two thirds of the show were entertaining,
5052440	5057440	but you want to hit us with another great overheard LA quote.
5057440	5058440	Oh, yeah.
5058440	5061440	Oh, but you can't because the phones don't work here.
5061440	5062440	I'll give you one.
5062440	5063440	Yeah.
5063440	5064440	Hey, where's this?
5064440	5069440	The pancetta.
5069440	5070440	I'm late.
5070440	5071440	I'm late for my coke class.
5071440	5072440	Yeah.
5072440	5075440	That was close as one was like, don't vape all over the charcuterie board.
5075440	5077440	I feel like that's the same thing.
5077440	5078440	That's awesome.
5078440	5081440	Who are this is loosely related, but like you vape on the charcuterie board.
5081440	5085440	No, but who, who are these people?
5085440	5088440	I don't, and I don't want to offend anybody that is one of these people
5088440	5090440	because obviously they outnumber me, but like,
5090440	5092440	like what's with the, the, uh,
5092440	5095440	the places where people go and they open their laptops and they just sit there
5095440	5098440	and they write their screenplays.
5098440	5100440	Like I don't know.
5100440	5101440	People do that.
5101440	5102440	That's like taking a poo poo.
5102440	5104440	Like, like, like, like, how can you like, just,
5104440	5108440	how can you even make with people around you?
5108440	5109440	That seems crazy to me.
5109440	5111440	Well, my friend who, uh, Alan Loeb,
5111440	5115440	who's actually the one who convinced me to, uh, start the account,
5115440	5119440	um, and has written such incredible movies as 21
5119440	5123440	and here comes the boom with, uh, Kevin James.
5123440	5127440	But, um, the, um,
5127440	5128440	here comes the boom.
5128440	5132440	You know, he, he's, he's a very successful screenwriter.
5132440	5134440	I don't know if there's going to be a boom too.
5134440	5135440	I'm not sure.
5135440	5136440	Here comes the boom.
5136440	5141440	Is Kevin James name boom in it?
5141440	5143440	Is his name boom?
5143440	5144440	I think so.
5144440	5145440	I don't know.
5145440	5146440	Okay.
5146440	5147440	Oh, you haven't seen.
5147440	5148440	Okay.
5148440	5150440	I'll look it up.
5150440	5152440	Like.
5152440	5155440	Rob, are you, you're speaking very quietly right now.
5155440	5159440	It makes me think you're, you're kind of getting ready to say something loud.
5159440	5161440	You're going to drop a loud one on us.
5161440	5164440	No, I'm not going to do a shock scare.
5164440	5167440	William boom has a problem.
5167440	5171440	But he, but you know, he's obviously been successful and, and, um,
5171440	5174440	worked his ass off for 20 years and built a career, but he still loves.
5174440	5177440	Here comes the boom.
5177440	5179440	What?
5179440	5180440	What's it?
5180440	5181440	What's he?
5181440	5182440	I don't know.
5182440	5184440	Like, like, what, what?
5184440	5187440	You're like, you're like a bill hater character now.
5187440	5188440	You're like that guy.
5188440	5190440	What about, what about a guy that he's a, he's a, he's a,
5190440	5193440	he's a boom operator, but, and he's, and he's,
5193440	5195440	and he's always getting his boom in the shot.
5195440	5196440	What?
5196440	5198440	It's like, okay.
5198440	5199440	And action.
5199440	5200440	Oh, no.
5200440	5201440	Oh, hey.
5201440	5202440	Hey.
5202440	5203440	Hey.
5203440	5204440	Yeah.
5204440	5207440	Wait, do, do vampires.
5207440	5209440	No vampires don't have a reflection.
5209440	5212440	Is there a mythological, mythological creature that doesn't have a shadow?
5212440	5213440	Gargoyle.
5213440	5215440	Gargoyle's down.
5215440	5216440	Gargoyle's down?
5216440	5217440	Minotaur.
5217440	5218440	Right.
5218440	5219440	Minotaur.
5219440	5220440	Hmm.
5220440	5221440	Hobgoblin.
5221440	5222440	Zebra.
5222440	5223440	Man.
5223440	5225440	I don't think ghost cast a shadow.
5225440	5227440	Ghost catcher.
5227440	5228440	Ghost catcher.
5228440	5229440	All right.
5229440	5230440	The biggest monster.
5230440	5231440	Continue.
5231440	5232440	Lich.
5232440	5235440	What if there's like a boom operator, but he gets like a.
5235440	5236440	Rust monster.
5236440	5240440	He's like, he's, instead of being the invisible man, he, anything he touches turns invisible,
5240440	5242440	so he becomes a boom operator.
5242440	5244440	So he can put that boom in any shot he wants to, because like.
5244440	5245440	Oh, that's good.
5245440	5246440	Get the best audio.
5246440	5247440	That's good.
5247440	5248440	Yeah.
5248440	5250440	That could be an episode of Rick and Morty.
5250440	5252440	69 episodes.
5252440	5257440	I spent about four hours talking about invisibility technology today in the Rick and Morty writers
5257440	5258440	room.
5258440	5262440	Like we were, we were picking apart like how invisibility tech would work and what it would
5262440	5263440	require.
5263440	5267440	Years ago, I met a guy who is in the military and he said that like, there is some military
5267440	5272440	briefing where like some guy like was walking around wearing an invisibility suit and you
5272440	5274440	could kind of see, but like you mostly couldn't.
5274440	5277440	And so people didn't even notice that he was in the room and they're like, this is the new
5277440	5279440	tech gentleman or whatever the fuck.
5279440	5280440	Yeah.
5280440	5285440	I mean, my conclusion was like, if you, it's like, it's like, forget about the, uh, it's
5285440	5289440	funny how in the eighties, like we kind of went biological with it and that's where you
5289440	5292440	got the trope of like, Oh, you have to be naked.
5292440	5296440	Like take otherwise you're just going to be like, because it was like, we went, it's funny
5296440	5299440	how like our consciousness of like sci-fi like proceeds along certain lines.
5299440	5304440	Like in the eighties, we were like an invisible person would have to be, it would have to
5304440	5306440	be like, Oh, your skin is invisible.
5306440	5311440	And then like, so that means you, if you were wearing a sports bra, it would just be a floating
5311440	5312440	sports bra and then you take it off.
5312440	5315440	And that way we'd make these movies about like, Oh no, I'm naked.
5315440	5320440	And I'm, but we, yeah, it's now more like, like, I think, yeah, like we were talking
5320440	5323440	today about like, what, okay, what if Rick had an invisibility belt?
5323440	5327440	Like, what would it, it would be a belt and like, he would have designed it to be like
5327440	5332440	easy to just, so it's like, we're, I was, I was like, uh, probably be like a, it's like
5332440	5337440	a cloud of, you know, like scans the contiguous surfaces, you know?
5337440	5343440	So if you're holding a coffee cup and you activate the belt, like the coffee cup will
5343440	5347440	disappear because for the same reason your shirt does and your hair does and your fingernails
5347440	5353440	and your everything, because it's like, uh, it scans the surfaces.
5353440	5355440	So the cup doesn't have to wear a belt either.
5355440	5358440	No, the cup doesn't have to wear a belt.
5358440	5360440	And it could, it could.
5360440	5363440	The cup, I'm sure, could wear a little belt.
5363440	5371440	If the cup wears a little belt and then Rick picks it up, would he not need the belt anymore?
5371440	5372440	If it was the right, the same time.
5372440	5374440	All right. Well, you actually, I mean, that's.
5374440	5375440	Did I break the story?
5375440	5376440	Well, you didn't break.
5376440	5379440	68 episodes, 68 episodes.
5379440	5381440	I mean, that's actually a pretty good point.
5381440	5384440	Do I not just put the belt around a coffee cup and hold the coffee cup?
5384440	5385440	Yeah.
5385440	5387440	You get a nice hot cup of coffee and you're invisible.
5387440	5388440	And you're invisible.
5388440	5392440	And each time you want to turn visible, put the cup down.
5392440	5393440	All right.
5393440	5395440	I mean, I'm telling you, I'm using it.
5395440	5396440	Can't stay up.
5396440	5399440	It makes more sense than having like worry about a belt around yourself.
5399440	5400440	Yeah.
5400440	5407440	I don't know what the fucking problem is over there.
5407440	5411440	But it was kind of like a, you need like a cloud of, uh, like, like that,
5411440	5415440	that kind of like mapped itself around your surfaces and like,
5415440	5420440	and have like subatomic cameras and like photo receptors and projectors
5420440	5426440	that, that, that like we're taking in information from all the light that
5426440	5429440	hit it from every conceivable angle in real time.
5429440	5433440	And then simultaneously where it's like having a relationship with anything
5433440	5436440	in any variation of like behind it.
5436440	5440440	And then I asked the question like, well, what if you back up against a wall?
5440440	5443440	Wouldn't you then project a shadow onto your surface?
5443440	5445440	But then I was like, no, I'm thinking macroscopically.
5445440	5450440	Like if you, if they're subatomic, like nano cameras, I don't know if there's,
5450440	5454440	I don't know if you can go subatomic with your nano, but, uh, I mean, hey,
5454440	5457440	what's your nano if it's not subatomic?
5457440	5461440	Uh, but if it's like, then it's like, you could like push up against a wall
5461440	5465440	and still to like something that's like the size of an electron or like somewhat
5465440	5469440	bigger, there'd still be a football field worth of distance between it and even
5469440	5471440	a surface you're touching maybe.
5471440	5474440	Yeah. And I also think that it would want to map like the surface and then the
5474440	5477440	light level that it was, you know, intercepting.
5477440	5480440	So it's going to, it's going to make these calculations like, well,
5480440	5482440	there's a spotlight on the front of me.
5482440	5486440	Right. Then I'm going to take information from between this camera on the back.
5486440	5489440	And then I'm going to like, it's basically like the whole thing's job.
5489440	5491440	Obviously it sounds kind of dumb to say it out loud, but it's like the whole
5491440	5495440	thing's job is just to airbrush you out of, of, of an exit.
5495440	5499440	It's to take in all available data, which I do believe is possible.
5499440	5503440	It's just a matter of processing and AI and stuff that you would be able to
5503440	5510440	have a cloud of technology around you that was making calculations fast enough
5510440	5516440	to simply adjust for what, for all light coming at it and projecting light
5516440	5519440	outward. And you'd need like a tremendous amount of power probably too,
5519440	5521440	because it's not going to be powered by the light.
5521440	5524440	It would be like a battery that would be running out because it would be like,
5524440	5526440	it'd be like the world's most fancy lamp.
5526440	5531440	It would be like sending out like a bazillion light waves out that were like
5531440	5533440	being compensated for.
5533440	5536440	There's also like the version that it just, it doesn't actually do that.
5536440	5541440	It just, it just moves the light that would hit you to where it would go past
5541440	5545440	you. So it just bends the light around you and then puts it back at the right
5545440	5548440	exact angle right after it clears your body.
5548440	5553440	So then it's the same beam of light that would go and hit you and reflect off
5553440	5557440	showing a visual picture. And that beam of light hits the, hits the wall behind
5557440	5559440	you and then vice versa, the back way.
5559440	5563440	Yeah. I do believe that they're, I'm certain that they got to be working on that
5563440	5569440	in the military. I know that like the, that, that poor young lady that, that wound
5569440	5574440	up in the water tank at the Cecil hotel, like the part of that myth, you know,
5574440	5578440	the conspiracy theories about that is that she, so there's some, there's some
5578440	5583440	like, like two degrees of separation between her and like invisibility
5583440	5588440	technology. The red handed podcast talked about her after they heard their
5588440	5593440	appearance here because while they were in LA, they, and, and it was, it was like,
5593440	5597440	that the idea was that that's what she's in the elevator and she's like interacting
5597440	5603440	with things that aren't there is because she stumbled too close to cloaking tech.
5603440	5607440	I'm laughing because it's a terrible desecration of a human being's death to
5607440	5611440	like have these like weird captain America theories about like, I just imagine
5611440	5614440	her parents going like, I wonder what happened to her. And that's all, well,
5614440	5618440	I've got a theory. I think that GI Joe did it. And they're like, thanks,
5618440	5625440	but still kind of because there was a scene in the elevator in captain America.
5625440	5629440	Oh God. Right. Where he's invisible. I'm like, I'm, was he invisible? Yeah.
5629440	5633440	And that scene. Have you seen the security camera footage of the, of the
5633440	5639440	elite Aliza lamb that disappeared from the hotel and then ended up in there.
5639440	5644440	Have you seen that? Are you familiar with that? I haven't watched it recently.
5644440	5649440	That's fair. Has cold case murder mysteries weighed in?
5649440	5654440	Uh, yes. What did he say? Um, she,
5654440	5659440	she that, that, um, she was off her meds and,
5659440	5664440	and that she may have even, um, found some stuff,
5664440	5669440	like maybe took some E or something, but like in any case was off her meds and
5669440	5674440	was experiencing and she, that she was in a suicidal state and like kind of
5674440	5679440	found her way up to the highest point and, uh,
5679440	5681440	and just kind of went with it, you know,
5681440	5686440	but she was just on a trip and kind of found this like ladder going up to this
5686440	5689440	thing and went into this thing and there was water and it was nice.
5689440	5694440	And she just kind of had an accident. Um, I like that.
5694440	5698440	I like Asperger detective does it again. It's,
5698440	5701440	it's usually not as simple as usually more simple than it seems.
5701440	5704440	He's going to come on the show now. Yeah. He's coming on.
5704440	5706440	I think may 20th or something, which is actual name.
5706440	5711440	So we don't have to call it Asperger detective. Ryan Krauss.
5711440	5714440	It's Ryan Krauss. We have confirmation that he doesn't mind being called that,
5714440	5718440	but I think maybe other people mind him being called that. Uh, so yeah,
5718440	5721440	we'll start calling him. I also, Dan, I told you,
5721440	5725440	I ran into open Mike Eagle the other day and, uh, he, uh, you, you're, uh,
5725440	5727440	your tape that you guys made of you rapping, uh,
5727440	5729440	he was talking about that's going to drop soon. So he wants to come back on the
5729440	5733440	show. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to drop soon.
5733440	5736440	I think there's references. It's like, uh, there's, there's,
5736440	5742440	I'm like rapping on that. Now I'm going, I'm 44 years old and it's to 2014.
5743440	5747440	All right. Uh, he said, he said at one point you got, you got quite high.
5747440	5751440	And then, uh, he said, yeah, he goes, uh, Dan went into a pretty, uh, pretty,
5751440	5754440	pretty dark place. Yeah. We talked about that on here.
5754440	5757440	I like smoked like a fucking ridiculous conical shaped joint.
5757440	5761440	I like that. Look like a sushi hand roll. And like, I,
5761440	5766440	and was like, I just, all the only thing I remember is, is crying.
5766440	5771440	And Mike got like doing things like behind the other glass and going like,
5772440	5776440	Dan, what's going on, man? I don't know.
5777440	5781440	Just tell me how you feel. Tell me what you want. What do you want?
5781440	5786440	I want black people to like me. Why go?
5787440	5792440	And that's all I remember. So I'm not looking forward to that track because I'm
5793440	5798440	sure the reason isn't awesome. I got to hear this.
5798440	5799440	I say we do a double whammy.
5799440	5803440	We play that track when he comes from the show and we have Rob's drawing of you
5803440	5807440	up on the jumbo truck. Yeah. You know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a,
5807440	5811440	I'm a social media pinata. Everyone, everyone grab your candy.
5811440	5815440	I'm a, I've, you know, I'm, I don't want to say I'm unfireable.
5816440	5821440	All right. Jesse Margolis. What, uh,
5822440	5826440	so what's the worst city to overhear things in right now?
5826440	5830440	You've spawned overheard New York, overheard London, overheard Dubai.
5831440	5836440	No, not overheard Dubai. What's the, what's the, what's by far the worst one?
5837440	5841440	Uh, you don't have to answer. Yeah, I don't know. Milwaukee, I would imagine.
5842440	5846440	Overheard Milwaukee would be amazing. Yeah, it would be challenging.
5846440	5849440	I, did I ever tell you the overheard thing I heard in the Morristown,
5849440	5854440	New Jersey? We, uh, we got a woo from Morristown or just New Jersey.
5855440	5860440	All right. She thought better of it. Um, uh, producer from Morristown.
5862440	5867440	Is he leaving? Are you from Morristown? You like your cat food,
5867440	5871440	fancy lady? Stupid. Are you from Morristown?
5872440	5876440	Mmm, no delicious liver cutlets. God. Where are you from in Jersey?
5878440	5882440	Maltville. That's not what you said. That got a real woo.
5883440	5886440	He's like a talented Mr. Ripley situation. He's going to.
5886440	5889440	I won't name names in this, but we did an improv show in Morristown.
5889440	5892440	It was great. Lovely theater. And we went across the street to this pub and restaurant,
5892440	5896440	which is by the theater and the people that were our servers were lovely and they were very nice and very polite.
5896440	5900440	They had their little uniforms on and then they, they told, hey, like this restaurant's closing.
5900440	5906440	Do you want to come out with us? We're going to go to this bar. And we went to this bar and, uh,
5907440	5912440	so there's like all these girls that were there were the waitresses that this nice little pub,
5913440	5919440	they got into their street clothes and took us to this really hilarious dive bar that was like just frozen in 1991.
5920440	5925440	And people were doing the electric slide to ice, ice, baby. It was fucking weird.
5925440	5930440	And it was really good. And Ryan Stiles was there and this girl was coming on to him.
5931440	5937440	Uh, like she's very, very attractive, younger gal, like, you know, way more than half his age and a way less than half his age.
5937440	5941440	And, uh, and we're all leaving and we're going to the other bar.
5941440	5949440	But I had found out that she was there with her fiance, who was this English young guy who is very charming and nice and they're engaged.
5949440	5952440	But she is so overtly trying to nail Ryan.
5952440	5957440	And we're going to the bar and she's like, really just like hanging on him and propositioning him basically.
5957440	5963440	And, and I'm like, like saying to like her friend, her fiance is like right there.
5963440	5966440	Like, what is she doing? And, and she's like, I don't know.
5966440	5970440	And they're chain smoking and they're swearing and it's really Jersey. It's great.
5970440	5976440	And, uh, and this is what I overhear. She comes back and like Ryan, I told her, like, no, like I'm married or whatever.
5976440	5981440	And, you know, I showed him the ring, showed her the ring and I overhear her go, oh, well, you got to be single.
5981440	5984440	The fuck one of you guys, you did tell us.
5984440	5988440	Damn. You're going to stop me early. I know. I didn't want it.
5988440	5991440	It's hard. It's like, uh, it's like a parsley teeth thing.
5991440	5994440	It's like, like, I don't know what to cut it out of the show.
5994440	6000440	I didn't. This is the first time, you know, it must be hard to do overheard.
6000440	6008440	A quiet place. A quiet place.
6009440	6015440	Because if they talk, they get ate by monsters and a quiet place.
6015440	6020440	But the person that's overhearing it, it could be quietly typing into the Instagram account.
6020440	6024440	Like, I heard a guy go like, ouch, I stubbed my toe.
6024440	6029440	Or if the account is just owned by the things that are eating people, they're just like,
6029440	6033440	it's not even like funny stuff. They're just like, it's just people going like,
6034440	6037440	they're just celebrating.
6037440	6041440	Overheard baby, baby spitting.
6041440	6049440	Overheard sound of a foam padded booby hatch in a lean to cabin surrounded by Christmas lights.
6055440	6057440	Watch the movie.
6057440	6061440	Be a fan. You got the, there's my overheard one.
6061440	6064440	Yeah, I mean, it's just for the record.
6064440	6070440	Verified account, Dan Harmon, hits you up on January 19th, 2018, a very dark day.
6070440	6074440	This is Leslie Arfit to Nicole Delaney while we're working on a script.
6074440	6079440	I could hook you up with nerds, but it's not like Rushmore, okay? They're losers.
6079440	6083440	There, that's it. I thought that was funny.
6083440	6085440	Four likes.
6085440	6087440	Four likes?
6087440	6089440	No, I'm just imagining.
6090440	6094440	But the, I mean, a great movie, great soundtrack.
6094440	6095440	Yeah, for sure.
6095440	6096440	What it's worth.
6096440	6100440	No, I thought she was, I thought she really, that really resonated.
6100440	6104440	Because Nicole's a lot younger. It's just like, it's like, no, you don't understand nerds,
6104440	6107440	not nerds, like billionaires.
6107440	6109440	She meant like Avengers.
6109440	6111440	She meant geeks, right?
6111440	6114440	Look, I have semantics. I don't know. I mean, look.
6114440	6117440	Isn't there a big gap between geeks and nerds?
6117440	6122440	Well, there used to be, a geek hasn't been, geek has kind of been like sidelined, right?
6122440	6126440	There used to be a lot of talk about this, which is like, nerds are,
6126440	6132440	nerds can look like anything, but like it's about their fascination with specific topics
6132440	6135440	that makes them socially unrelatable.
6135440	6141440	And then like geeks are like more like their IQ can be in any range,
6141440	6144440	but they're physically, there's something wrong.
6144440	6147440	They have like bad mannerisms or whatever.
6147440	6151440	Like they have a lizard for a pet or something.
6151440	6154440	Yeah, which makes sense because like geeks, like I think it's...
6154440	6156440	Then what's a dork then?
6156440	6159440	Yeah, a dork.
6159440	6162440	A dork's probably like just a young nerd.
6162440	6164440	Like a puppy nerd.
6164440	6166440	Yeah, but I would just use them interchangeably.
6166440	6169440	I don't know why I'm, I mean, now, like you're a dork.
6169440	6173440	I just feel like there was a Vice article about this in 2013 that we would reach out about.
6174440	6178440	Millhouse says like geeks are, nerds are good at something.
6178440	6181440	We're like meat geeks are just nerds.
6182440	6185440	When I was growing up, they said a dork was a whale's penis.
6185440	6187440	You guys hear about that?
6187440	6188440	A dork?
6188440	6189440	A dork.
6189440	6190440	People are like, oh, you're a dork.
6190440	6192440	And then they go, ha ha, that means whale's penis.
6192440	6193440	And I never looked at that.
6193440	6194440	I thought it was a donkey penis.
6194440	6198440	I heard it was just any penis.
6198440	6202440	I didn't hear like specifically like if it was a whale penis.
6202440	6203440	Right.
6203440	6204440	Or a donkey penis.
6204440	6208440	It was just, just, just a penis is what I thought.
6208440	6213440	Like if you call somebody a dork, you're basically calling them a penis.
6213440	6214440	A dick, yeah.
6214440	6215440	Is what I thought.
6215440	6217440	They rated our animated film Heavy Metal.
6217440	6220440	The guy refers to his dork.
6220440	6221440	Right.
6221440	6222440	Maybe that's what the spawn is.
6222440	6226440	You know, people don't say any more for fucking, is pork.
6226440	6227440	Oh, yeah.
6227440	6229440	Because, and a European vacation.
6229440	6230440	European vacation.
6230440	6231440	He's gonna pork for us.
6231440	6233440	Yes, Rusty, he may porker.
6233440	6234440	Good reference to that.
6234440	6236440	That's for me is the funniest line in that film.
6236440	6239440	I thought that was, I mean, that was the defining line of my childhood.
6239440	6241440	Yes, Rusty, he may porker.
6241440	6243440	New language that I'm not a fan of.
6243440	6244440	Cum gutters.
6244440	6247440	Don't like to, don't want to hear about your cum gutters.
6247440	6248440	What, what, what, what, what?
6248440	6251440	It's a reference to these like muscles down here.
6251440	6255440	Like kind of like if you're fucking ripped, because we've gone beyond six packs.
6255440	6256440	Cum gutters?
6256440	6257440	That's not enough.
6257440	6260440	It's like, cum gutters are like the kind of angular like, you know, muscles.
6260440	6261440	Like, like, look at those cum guys.
6261440	6262440	Where's the cum coming from?
6262440	6263440	And like, what direction is it?
6263440	6265440	That's, that's the thing that I hate.
6265440	6270440	What I hate about that phrase is that it makes you picture watery cum.
6270440	6273440	Like old cum.
6273440	6275440	Just flowing down.
6275440	6279440	By the time cum needs a gutter, it's gross.
6279440	6282440	Cum doesn't, by the way, serve piping hot.
6282440	6286440	It's not fucking, it's not glamorous.
6286440	6290440	But at least, but at least it's indicative of a fucking moment.
6290440	6296440	The idea of it needing a gutter means it's like been laying somewhere for five to ten
6296440	6297440	minutes.
6297440	6298440	And it's like, oh, okay.
6298440	6299440	Like, like, yeah.
6299440	6300440	Whose is it?
6300440	6301440	Your own?
6301440	6302440	So you jerk off laying on your back like a freak?
6302440	6303440	Yeah, but, but, oh.
6303440	6304440	I'm a, I'm a kneeler.
6304440	6305440	I'm a kneeler.
6305440	6308440	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
6308440	6312440	And then I guess it's just like, I just, it makes me picture Brad Pitt in the nineties
6312440	6316440	and it's just like with cum all over him and like it's like dripping symmetrically
6316440	6322440	down each side of his, like, I don't want to, I don't want to picture that at all.
6322440	6323440	What?
6323440	6324440	Brad Pitt.
6324440	6325440	Cum gutters.
6325440	6326440	Just makes me imagine Brad Pitt with cum.
6326440	6330040	Because they go, they go, they go to your sides as there's just, there's just people
6330040	6332440	coming on your, on your hips and then, and then it flows gently down the ceiling.
6332440	6333440	I think it's your own cum.
6333440	6337680	I think it's based on the idea of like the guy just jerking off and like, he comes on
6337680	6341440	his own torso and then it's like the cum, those are, these are disgusting things.
6341440	6343440	These are disgusting people coming up with these phrases.
6343440	6347440	They're, they're, they're trying to think of the grossest way to describe something and
6347440	6352440	they're succeeding something beautiful and they got to fuck it up with their gross language.
6352440	6353440	Something beautiful.
6353440	6354440	Jesus has them.
6354440	6356440	Like it's a, it's a good, it's a good fucking like.
6356440	6358440	He's got sweet cum gutters.
6358440	6359440	Yeah.
6359440	6360440	Jesus.
6360440	6361440	Jesus.
6361440	6362440	That's sweet.
6362440	6363440	Yeah, man.
6363440	6364440	There's our title.
6364440	6365440	There's a fucking episode.
6365440	6366440	Yeah, we can't use that.
6366440	6370440	Brad Pitt has to like eat something every time he jacks off.
6371440	6376440	I'll take another sandwich.
6376440	6379440	You know what a fucking terrible summer job is?
6379440	6383440	The poor kid that's got to go clean out Brad Pitt's cum gutters.
6383440	6386440	I'm here to clean your cum gutters.
6386440	6391440	That's my Brad Pitt impression.
6391440	6394440	I only can do an impression of Brad Pitt from 12 Monkeys.
6394440	6408440	That's right after that movie is when he started eating and everything.
6408440	6409440	Yeah.
6409440	6411440	It's like every movie after that.
6411440	6414440	He always has like a bag of sunflower seeds or potato chips or something.
6414440	6418440	Like he, he took a class or something that was like, you should eat something.
6418440	6420440	I'm not, I'm not disagreeing.
6420440	6421440	I think it's interesting.
6421440	6424440	He's a jealous acting coach because he's like checking out those hot cum gutters.
6424440	6426440	He's like, here's some potato chips.
6426440	6428440	It's like your cum gutters aren't going to last forever.
6428440	6435440	But your choices are.
6435440	6436440	Give your character some business.
6436440	6438440	What everyone eats.
6438440	6441440	Not everyone has cum gutters.
6441440	6449440	You're not going to be 27 forever, Brad.
6449440	6457440	I've seen 12 monkeys and I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
6457440	6459440	I don't know what he's doing.
6459440	6463440	He keeps looking at us too.
6463440	6466440	I'm hoping some erst erstwhile.
6466440	6469440	I've learned the meaning of the word erstwhile recently.
6469440	6470440	It's not earnest.
6470440	6476440	I'm hoping some earnest Harman town fan that has a subscription will split screen me
6476440	6482440	doing my Brad Pitt impression with the clip from 12 monkeys and fucking vindicate me.
6482440	6488440	How about, oh.
6488440	6494440	Because you, you need all 12 monkeys.
6494440	6496440	We'll fucking rent it.
6496440	6498440	It's a pretty fun movie.
6498440	6500440	This is what overheard cum sounds like, right?
6500440	6502440	Yeah, overheard cum.
6502440	6503440	That's right.
6503440	6505440	Heard cum.
6505440	6506440	All right.
6506440	6509440	Well, that's got to be about a whole podcast, right?
6509440	6510440	We're close.
6510440	6511440	Yeah.
6511440	6513440	Overheard while having sex is maybe something.
6513440	6514440	That could be something.
6514440	6515440	Yeah.
6515440	6516440	Yeah.
6516440	6519440	Do you think millennials are allowed to have problematic sex?
6519440	6521440	I don't know what the word problematic means.
6521440	6523440	Well, I mean, like, I think.
6523440	6524440	Prone to problems.
6524440	6527440	Does a mixed race millennial couple.
6527440	6537440	Like if a, if a, if a millennial couples crossing, like, uh, you'd say you have like, uh, two different, uh, ethnic backgrounds represented in your millennial couple.
6537440	6538440	Yes.
6538440	6553440	When they're in bed together, do they go to a, to a place that would get one of them fired if they tweeted, you know, I would hope so too, but they don't have to, if they, if they, if they, if that's not where their heart or their loins are going.
6553440	6559440	But I, I, I fear I read these articles probably in vice about how millennials are having less sex.
6559440	6563440	I think it's refinery 29 you're reading, but, but yeah.
6563440	6566440	But I think it, I think it is because they're terrified because it actually is.
6566440	6567440	I don't blame them.
6567440	6575440	They're seeing all the, they're, they're like, why on God's earth would I exchange bodily fluids with another human being that could end up like ruining my life?
6575440	6576440	I don't know if that's it.
6576440	6585440	I mean, I, I started having sex in the sort of nineties when, you know, nobody, I mean, I guess that's when VR started happening.
6585440	6586440	Yeah. But like AIDS too.
6586440	6598440	And like, um, you know, I remember being at college at, uh, I mean, we've talked about this many times at, um, UC Santa Barbara and I, I had like, you know, a three summer, a four summer side, never had anything like that.
6598440	6609440	And hadn't since, but I was, you know, a neurotic Jew and I was just terrified and I drove home to LA and sat my parents down and was like, you know, I think I just got AIDS.
6609440	6610440	Um, so that was scary.
6610440	6615440	I was scared of sex because of that.
6615440	6618440	Um, I don't think people now are, are, are as scared of it for those reasons.
6618440	6622440	I think they're, I think they're getting stimulation from a lot of places.
6622440	6629440	I wonder if they role play though in bed is what I'm saying, because a lot of sexual role play is going to go to whatever the definition of taboo is.
6629440	6648440	And the good news would be that the definition of taboo is now more readily available than ever, because I, I personally believe that the human sexual, uh, kind of organ that is the brain, it only really needs a boundary to cross in order to get it.
6648440	6665440	It's like, if there is a place to go that you're not supposed to go, the human brain in a sexual like, uh, mode is going to want to head toward those dark corners of the room and explore boundaries and things.
6665440	6679440	Um, and, uh, I w I, I find myself wondering, like, uh, do does today's 25 year old, when they, they, they do their hologram dating or whatever they do, they swipe left and they swipe diagonally.
6679440	6682440	And then they, they end up in a relationship where they're having sex.
6682440	6692440	Like, do they, when they're actually having sex, do they then, do they then go a little animalistic, you know, do they conjure situations?
6692440	6696440	Anybody out there by applause? All right.
6696440	6699440	I mean, do they speak, stand up.
6699440	6706440	Like, is it possible to have that, that compartmentalization where you're like, look, I'm an activist.
6706440	6713440	I believe in like all of these, uh, rights and things and these microaggressions and oppressions and things.
6713440	6717440	And like, we have to be watchful and aware of all these little ways that we're hurting each other.
6717440	6727440	But then with a partner to like throw it all away for the sake of like these genuine like kind of ruts where you're like, let's, let's be sea lions.
6727440	6733440	And just, um, you know, here's who here's, here's, here's what we're doing.
6733440	6736440	I don't, I don't, I, I, I wonder about that.
6736440	6739440	Let's be sea lions.
6739440	6744440	I can't even riff like examples because I feel like that's the thing about the public world that we're living today.
6744440	6752440	And that's why I wonder a good thing about that would be if you told me, yeah, but in the bedroom, they're, they're going nuts.
6752440	6755440	Like I would, I feel like for these kids, great. I'm glad for them.
6755440	6770440	I mean, I don't know, uh, obviously, but I think that it's, it's more that, you know, I saw an article recently where it was like 2%, like 80% of all tweets come from 2% of people.
6770440	6773440	Wow. Bernie Sanders is going to go crazy about that.
6773440	6779440	Yeah. The billionaire class, the billionaire class, the billionaire class.
6779440	6784440	Um, but, um, yeah, so I think a lot of this stuff is exaggerated.
6784440	6790440	I think there's this, you know, fear of the public square and the flogging and all that, but people are actually quite, quite normal.
6790440	6794440	But people are getting fired. I mean, they're, they are, but I think, I think they're having sex.
6794440	6800440	I think there's people are more stimulated by video games or Instagram and, and that kind of feedback or social currency.
6800440	6805440	Excuse me for a second. What the fuck is going on over here? What's going on? Can I get you something?
6805440	6809440	I wasn't on mic. I didn't do anything. I'm not bothering anybody.
6809440	6810440	I can hear you. What's going on?
6810440	6812440	Why do you got to go get up all in my biz, man?
6812440	6815440	What are you explaining? What are you doing? I'm trying to hear a guest over here.
6815440	6818440	I'm not bothering you. I'm not bothering you. I'm over here.
6818440	6819440	I think you're kind of bothering.
6819440	6821440	What was he saying to you? What was he saying?
6821440	6823440	Somebody had left and he was, he was.
6823440	6825440	I was going, what the fuck is going on?
6825440	6827440	Oh, right.
6827440	6829440	And you thought I was talking about you.
6829440	6833440	Yeah. Well, it's weird how shit rolls uphill.
6833440	6834440	Downhill.
6834440	6837440	That's weird. Yeah.
6837440	6841440	Sorry, Jesse.
6841440	6844440	Anyways.
6844440	6848440	Oh.
6848440	6850440	All right. So look.
6850440	6854440	Let's quit screwing around here. Let's start the show.
6854440	6857440	We should have like, you know what we should have? We don't have to figure it out tonight,
6857440	6861440	but what we do need in the show is like a kind of the Mickey Mouse Club kind of thing
6861440	6865440	where it's like, it's time to say goodbye or kind of thing where, because it's like,
6865440	6870440	how often do we just like have to, you know, like.
6870440	6871440	No, no, no.
6871440	6875440	I was going to say we could sing the microvelo theme.
6875440	6880440	Does anybody here play piano well enough to we can make up a little Mickey Mouse like show under?
6880440	6881440	No.
6881440	6882440	Damn.
6882440	6883440	All right. Wow.

6904440	6907440	Sergio, why don't you paint the space right now?
6907440	6908440	Give us a little jingle.
6908440	6910440	I don't get enough for a guideline, but I can play a simple melody.
6910440	6921440	Well, yeah, just play us like like a hundred hundred twenty beats per minute, like maybe four chords.
6921440	6925440	Harmontown.
6925440	6930440	It's coming to an ending.
6930440	6933440	Harmontown.

6934440	6939440	We weren't intending to do what we did.
6939440	6942440	It's only a show.

6944440	6946440	We make it up as we go.
