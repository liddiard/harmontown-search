707000	710000	Please welcome Spencer Crittenden to the stage.
710000	717000	applause
717000	720000	What up? Oh, fuck.
720000	727000	You know, that's such a good applause. I'm only going to betray that confidence in me.
727000	732000	See, that laugh is exactly what I'm talking about. Get ready for that the whole night.
732000	737000	And the mayor of Harmentown, Mr. Dan Land. Dan Harmon!
737000	742000	applause
742000	747000	applause
747000	752000	applause
752000	758000	Thank you, New York. I love you so much the second time. The first show was kind of a trial run.
758000	763000	If you were at that show, and you're also at this one,
763000	768000	it's twice as expensive for the real show.
768000	773000	If you were at that show, and you're not at this one,
773000	779000	I'm not saying anything that makes us legally accountable. You can't get a refund.
779000	784000	I'm saying legally it was a good show last night.
784000	792000	I'm leaving a paper trail that I considered that a good show, worth $25 plus a $10 seating fee.
793000	798000	But I'm saying to you people, you're in for a much better show.
798000	803000	Oh, big time. We got guests.
803000	808000	Donald Trump is here, everybody. Donald Trump is here.
808000	813000	We're all so tired. We're all so raw. We're all so sad.
813000	819000	One of the silver linings of the things that I talked about already is
820000	827000	we're all so fucking scared that actually normal Republicans are talking to Democrats and stuff
827000	832000	and saying, look, all I ever wanted was to make money.
832000	837000	There's some honesty getting squeezed out of this zit of an election.
837000	843000	I don't know what to tell you, kids, because I guess actually we're talking to people.
844000	850000	Most of the people that we're talking to will already have voted or not voted, and the election is over.
850000	851000	Especially once this stops.
851000	853000	Because the podcast is on Wednesday.
853000	857000	So I'm only talking to a room full of people before the election.
857000	862000	Everyone else is like, whatever you're talking about doesn't matter anymore.
862000	866000	And we're only 300 people, so we don't matter.
866000	872000	And we're in a certain state and a certain jurisdiction, and nothing matters.
872000	876000	Kids...
876000	880000	I would say, if you live in a swing state...
880000	884000	I'm not talking to anyone in a swing state.
884000	886000	It's too late for you to tell anything.
886000	892000	If you live in a swing state, either good job or what the fuck.
892000	894000	Yeah, it's all over already.
894000	897000	We're actually living in the time but...
897000	900000	We're living in the future because nothing we do matters.
900000	903000	Nothing we do will change the election, which hasn't happened yet.
903000	907000	But as far as we're concerned, it already happened.
907000	908000	That's kind of weird.
908000	909000	We live in the future right now.
909000	915000	So let's open the imaginary door in one of two scenarios.
915000	923000	In one scenario, in a predictable election, we now have the first woman president.
923000	927000	And it's a Democrat.
928000	938000	And we've therefore aggravated a frothy, frothy white nationalist population who are not...
938000	941000	That's their dream result.
941000	948000	They're going to function a lot better if there's a race traitor lady in the White House,
948000	950000	and their only job is complaining.
950000	952000	That's going to be their...
952000	954000	That's their White House.
954000	955000	They love that.
955000	958000	They're not dreaming of Capitol Hill.
958000	960000	They're not dreaming of...
960000	965000	If you're right now a white nationalist, you're probably...
965000	970000	I don't know how to chart your weekly income, but it's got to be spiking right now.
970000	973000	In the form of combat boot fees.
973000	976000	I don't know how they make their money.
976000	980000	But you know they're making three times as much right now as they ever have.
980000	986000	And that would end if you did elect Hitler.
986000	988000	Because then he'd be like,
988000	990000	So I love being president.
990000	991000	And then they'd be like,
991000	993000	What's up with that Hitler stuff?
993000	994000	Come on, let's do that Hitler stuff.
994000	995000	He'd be like,
995000	996000	I can't do it.
996000	998000	It's going to be huge when I do it.
998000	999000	And they're going to be like,
999000	1000000	This guy is bad Hitler.
1000000	1002000	He's bad at being Hitler.
1002000	1003000	And he's going to be like,
1003000	1005000	Yeah, I'm bad at everything.
1005000	1009000	That's always been the fucking bit, you mooks.
1009000	1011000	I'm the fucking son of a slumlord.
1011000	1014000	It's hilarious that I'm standing here and you can't change that.
1014000	1016000	I fucking win.
1016000	1018000	I win when I lose.
1018000	1019000	I win when I win.
1019000	1020000	I have hair.
1020000	1022000	I don't have hair.
1022000	1026000	I'm white, but I'm orange.
1026000	1028000	I fucking like...
1028000	1032000	We're going to remember him as a hero 40 years from now
1032000	1037000	when we're like rowing space boats away from a...
1037000	1042000	A planet that just burnt to a cinder whether anyone was president or not.
1042000	1048000	Just fucking burnt up because of a fucking fireball from the sun or something.
1048000	1050000	Oh, fuck.
1050000	1051000	Can that happen?
1051000	1053000	Does the sun shoot fireballs?
1053000	1054000	I'm asking you.
1054000	1055000	Oh, yeah, that can happen.
1055000	1058000	The sun shoots fireballs.
1058000	1061000	It's called a solar flare ball.
1061000	1064000	Event.
1064000	1076000	Spencer has been hanging out more than he has hung out.
1076000	1083000	You had a conversation at some point in a van or something.
1083000	1085000	It was in a white van.
1085000	1088000	You're on the way to an undisclosed location.
1088000	1091000	There's a phrase, sexual innuendo.
1091000	1093000	Yes.
1093000	1098000	For the folks at home, what is sexual innuendo?
1098000	1106000	Sexual innuendo is when you're not saying penis, but you mean penis.
1106000	1109000	I'd like to handle that gear shift or something.
1109000	1116000	If I say, I'm sorry, I have to go wax the flagpole if you know what I mean.
1116000	1118000	And then the person says, I do know what you mean.
1118000	1121000	You mean you're going to go stroke your cock.
1121000	1124000	And that was innuendo.
1124000	1129000	And then if you say, no, that was innuendo.
1129000	1133000	That's meta innuendo.
1133000	1135000	But it's also a pun, right?
1135000	1137000	It's all kinds of stuff.
1137000	1139000	It's fanservice is what it is.
1139000	1147000	It'll not win an Emmy, but it'll keep you squeaking by.
1147000	1150000	You'll be flushing signature appointments.
1151000	1152000	Oh, man.
1152000	1153000	Never mind.
1153000	1154000	I can't talk about that.
1154000	1155000	Okay.
1155000	1156000	Don't say that.
1156000	1158000	Don't say stuff you can't talk about.
1158000	1159000	That's horrible.
1159000	1162000	That's crazy to say to people.
1162000	1165000	Innuendo, always sexual.
1165000	1166000	Right.
1166000	1169000	In today's world, it is.
1169000	1173000	We have the phrase, sexual innuendo, because not all innuendo is sexual.
1173000	1174000	Right.
1174000	1175000	Only sexual innuendo is.
1176000	1183000	And so Spencer said last night, we need to bring back non-sexual innuendo.
1183000	1184000	Yeah.
1184000	1185000	It's fun.
1185000	1186000	I thought that would be a great goal.
1186000	1187000	I don't know.
1187000	1189000	I don't have anything else to do tonight.
1189000	1192000	So I thought we could bring back non-sexual innuendo.
1192000	1193000	Right.
1193000	1204000	So like if I were to say, hey, tomorrow night, I'm going to sharpen a pencil, if you know
1204000	1205000	what I mean.
1205000	1206000	Right.
1206000	1207000	But you're like.
1207000	1212000	Well, proper innuendo, I don't think you want to be saying if you know what I mean.
1212000	1213000	Right.
1213000	1214000	Oh, no.
1214000	1215000	Okay.
1215000	1217000	Because innuendo, it's about double speak.
1217000	1219000	It's about hiding the true intention of what you're saying.
1219000	1220000	So it's a bad habit.
1220000	1221000	It's a bad habit.
1221000	1224000	Uninitiative parties don't know that you're talking about what you're talking about and
1224000	1227000	think you're just talking about bread or pigeons or something.
1227000	1228000	Yeah.
1228000	1229000	So like, I don't know.
1229000	1232000	Like, here's, this is me complaining about something.
1232000	1233000	Okay.
1233000	1241000	I can't stand how burnt my buns are getting with all these bread lines being so close.
1241000	1243000	You see?
1243000	1246000	That's just me talking about bread to you people.
1246000	1250000	You couldn't possibly imagine I was meaning other things by that sentence because that's
1250000	1253000	just normal bread people talk.
1253000	1255000	But I was really complaining about something.
1255000	1257000	I know you mean like, let the fourth Reich begin.
1257000	1259000	Right.
1259000	1262000	I know that and you know that, but they don't know that.
1262000	1263000	And that's why it's great.
1263000	1269000	And that's why we need to bring it back to hide our white nationalist tendencies.
1269000	1273000	So whatever happens on Tuesday, is it still Tuesday?
1273000	1274000	Sure.
1274000	1276000	I mean, it'll probably go until like Wednesday or something, right?
1276000	1277000	Can we push it?
1277000	1279000	Just remember, okay.
1279000	1286000	So this time around, no matter what happens, like, we're all abused children.
1286000	1287000	We live in a home.
1287000	1290000	I don't care if you're conservative or whatever.
1290000	1292000	Like, you all agree with everybody.
1292000	1294000	We have 100% agreement on this.
1294000	1300000	The last year and a half has been an abusive relationship between us and the people that
1300000	1302000	would tell us what to do.
1302000	1305000	And we have felt fed up about it.
1305000	1310000	We have been raked over shit when we have better stuff to do.
1310000	1311000	We're not politicians.
1311000	1315000	We shouldn't have to think about their job this much.
1316000	1319000	Like, we are all bummed out.
1319000	1324000	And every moment that you would think the solution would be to not care, someone says
1324000	1331000	the word abortion, or women, or race, or anything that triggers you and goes, like,
1331000	1334000	well, they're talking about important shit.
1334000	1336000	Yeah, they're always going to be.
1336000	1338000	And they got to me and they got to you.
1338000	1343000	And we're now here on the eve of, like, something's going to give.
1343000	1346000	We're all going to stop having to fucking think about it for a while.
1346000	1349000	Like, we have to spend that four years.
1349000	1354000	Like, whatever these dumb-ass House of Representatives are that we're always hearing about,
1354000	1356000	like, oh, they own the...
1356000	1360000	We've got to start getting third-party candidates into those seats.
1360000	1361000	Like, I would...
1361000	1365000	That's my weird pitch is, like, let's just start...
1365000	1368000	Let's have the historic election and go, yay, we did it.
1368000	1374000	And then be like, okay, now, the next, like, weird election that comes up, if we believe
1374000	1377000	in this system, then we'll go, like, I don't...
1377000	1380000	If you say that you're Republican or Democrat, that's a red flag.
1380000	1381000	Like, you're...
1381000	1386000	Because you're part of a bad fucking weird good cop, bad cop, alcoholic husband system
1386000	1391000	where it's, like, this syndrome of, like, black eye and then apology, and black eye
1391000	1394000	and then apology, and it's, like, it's not fucking working.
1394000	1395000	We've given it 60 years.
1395000	1397000	They built the shit on top of something.
1397000	1400000	It's made of two legs, so you think it's two things, but it's an animal.
1400000	1401000	All right.
1401000	1402000	All right.
1402000	1403000	That's it.
1403000	1405000	That ends the political segment because now we don't have to worry about it anymore
1405000	1406000	because it's fucking...
1406000	1408000	We walk out of here and into a world where it already happened.
1408000	1409000	It's over.
1409000	1413000	And you're going to find out, like, that office is so insignificant, Hitler could be in it
1413000	1415000	and nothing would still happen.
1415000	1420000	He'd be like, I want to close Guantanamo or make it twice as big, and it would just be...
1420000	1425000	Guantanamo will still be there and the same size, like, four years from now, Hitler will
1425000	1426000	be like, I...
1426000	1430000	That should be filled with Jews and, like, a million times the size.
1430000	1433000	But it'll be caught up in red tape.
1433000	1434000	Just...
1434000	1437000	We can take comfort in our cat's cradle of fucking...
1437000	1438000	We're fine.
1438000	1443000	We'll be fine for a while.
1443000	1444000	Pompeii.
1444000	1447000	Last words at Pompeii.
1447000	1448000	It's fine.
1448000	1449000	It's a big mountain.
1449000	1452000	There's some lava dribbling out.
1452000	1456000	By the time that becomes an issue, I think we'll have time to wake up and grab the kids
1456000	1458000	and boom!
1458000	1460000	I'm catching a ball.
1460000	1462000	Forever.
1464000	1471000	In a museum in Milwaukee, they make the molds and there's, like, a guy holding a guy up.
1471000	1472000	Is that real?
1472000	1476000	When you go to, like, the Pompeii things and there's a guy with a knife and then there's
1476000	1478000	a rich guy going, like, here's my money.
1479000	1483000	He's, like, in the middle of being robbed and civilization...
1483000	1485000	That can't be real.
1485000	1488000	I don't know how to feel about that.
1488000	1490000	But that's got to be fake, right?
1490000	1496000	There's no such thing as an event that happens so fast that you can be mid-robbing.
1496000	1498000	Nothing has ever happened that quickly.
1498000	1500000	I bet a nuclear bomb might do that.
1500000	1502000	But it wouldn't leave anything, right?
1502000	1506000	You'd hear a whistle of the bomb coming down and you'd be like this.
1507000	1508000	Pompeii should be...
1508000	1510000	All of the Pompeii molds should be...
1510000	1512000	Everybody going, like...
1512000	1514000	That's if it happened really fast.
1514000	1518000	It should just be a bunch of people, maybe one guy's holding a knife.
1518000	1521000	And then you go, like, I bet he was robbing him.
1521000	1525000	That would be fun, but I don't believe that the guy's going, stick-a-ma-ah!
1527000	1529000	Like, it's like a freeze ray hit him.
1529000	1530000	Right.
1530000	1531000	I don't know if I believe that.
1531000	1532000	Yeah.
1532000	1533000	I'd like to believe that.
1533000	1534000	That's, like, a guillotine.
1534000	1537000	They say that guillotine is the most humane way of execution.
1537000	1539000	No one can, no one can test this.
1539000	1544000	You can't, you can't survey severed heads versus people that got lethal injection.
1544000	1547000	But they say that guillotine is the most humane way to kill somebody.
1547000	1556000	According to my 10th grade history teacher, who, who must write about everything because he was in Korea during the war
1556000	1560000	and he also would constantly accidentally smoke his chalk.
1561000	1571000	So I believe everything he says, and he said, all you feel is a cold, a cold, just a cold sensation in the back of your neck.
1571000	1572000	He doesn't know.
1572000	1573000	Blissful darkness.
1573000	1574000	Yeah.
1574000	1578000	Did he, did he mention the least humane way to execute somebody?
1578000	1579000	No.
1579000	1580000	Oh.
1580000	1585000	What do you think, what, I'd like to challenge you to come up with it.
1585000	1586000	All right.
1586000	1587000	Okay, okay.
1587000	1589000	The least humane way.
1589000	1590000	All right.
1590000	1596000	So you get a bunch of fire ants and then you give them knives.
1596000	1598000	Tiny fire ant sized knives.
1598000	1599000	Yeah.
1599000	1603000	Just let nature take its course.
1603000	1607000	I say humiliate them to death.
1607000	1616000	Keep them fed and watered and immortal and like make them have to die of shame.
1616000	1617000	Okay.
1617000	1620000	Well, that's, that's very, uh, conceptual.
1620000	1622000	But what does that, what does that look like?
1622000	1623000	What does it look like?
1623000	1624000	Yeah.
1624000	1625000	Well, how do you humiliate it?
1625000	1629400	It looks like a standard harness, uh, in a, in a windowless room with tubes going into
1629400	1633000	them that give them nutrients and a liquid.
1633000	1635000	And then the humiliation is happening.
1635000	1636000	No.
1636000	1637000	What's the humility?
1637000	1638000	Like is it people laughing?
1638000	1640000	Is he like getting his dick slapped or something?
1640000	1645000	Like that's no one wants to be seen with their dick being slapped in public, right?
1645000	1649000	You come into the room and you say, uh, hi, how are you?
1649000	1653000	And then you leave and then you do that 40 times.
1653000	1654000	Right.
1654000	1658000	And then the third, the 41st time you say, hi, how are you?
1658000	1660000	But you said I was going to leave.
1660000	1666000	Uh, anyways, that's just one example of how you'll never know what the fuck is going on.
1666000	1672000	Uh, I'm going to tell you some shit, not because you'll, you're, you ever have the right to
1672000	1673000	know?
1673000	1678000	And not because it profits me, but because it will make your torture more exquisite.
1678000	1683000	I'm telling you, you're part of a, of an experiment where we're seeing if we can humiliate a person
1683000	1684000	to death.
1684000	1685000	That's how significant you are.
1685000	1689000	You're interesting, but you don't matter.
1689000	1695000	Uh, if we don't humiliate you to death, I guess you'll die of gangrene or anything else that
1695000	1696000	would kill you.
1696000	1701000	But if we humiliate you to death, it will be no different.
1701000	1702000	It won't matter.
1702000	1703000	It won't matter.
1703000	1704000	You don't matter.
1704000	1708000	And I'd leave and I, and then I could keep coming back and I just like some days I'd
1708000	1714000	come back with a soda, like a diet Coke and I just, and then I'd leave.
1714000	1715000	I do.
1715000	1723000	What does humiliation mean to you?
1723000	1725000	To cause humility.
1725000	1726000	Right.
1726000	1730000	And humility is when two people are talking to each other.
1730000	1737000	No, humility is when one person being talked to feels like they don't mean very much.
1737000	1738000	Right.
1738000	1740840	But they mean enough that someone's spending their entire life.
1740840	1742880	I would nip that in the bud.
1742880	1747520	I would say, I would say to the guy, by the way, we're probably doing this to 700 people.
1747520	1749400	Well, you'd have to get different people.
1749400	1752680	It couldn't be you because you'd be like, man, you need to get a life, man.
1752680	1756280	No, but I would nip what you're talking about in the bud because you're getting to a thing.
1756280	1759200	That's what all the Twitter people go when they go, Dan, you're fat and you're untalented
1759200	1760200	and who cares?
1760200	1761200	Of course.
1761200	1762200	And then I go, fuck you.
1762200	1763200	And then they go, fuck me.
1763200	1764200	Fuck you.
1764200	1765200	And I go, fuck you, kid.
1765200	1766200	Fuck you.
1766200	1771200	And then the kid's like, fuck you, fuck you, and I say, you're fat and Chevy Chase, you're
1771200	1772200	fat, fat.
1772200	1775320	And I'm like, hey, kid, listen to me.
1775320	1777680	Fuck you.
1777680	1778680	Nothing's changing.
1778680	1781280	You, you got, you got open eyes.
1781280	1782280	Nothing's changing.
1782280	1784380	Well, something's changing.
1784380	1785800	This is where the kid always goes.
1785800	1787800	Now you're paying attention to me.
1787800	1788800	That's one thing.
1789800	1792800	That's the worst thing in the world.
1792800	1796360	Like, like, like you're fucking, that's so sad.
1796360	1797360	Like, like what?
1797360	1799520	We live in a society where attention is currency.
1799520	1801640	It's also attention to criminals.
1801640	1803200	Like you fucking like handcuff.
1803200	1804200	That's the problem.
1804200	1810400	But your attention is delivered to you electronically instantly with a system that notifies you.
1810400	1816240	The idea that being left alone was a luxury, like if people were like, like noticing you,
1816240	1817920	it was like, fuck, you don't notice me.
1818040	1819960	I got a right to be fucking obscure.
1819960	1822480	Like, it's called the pursuit of happiness.
1822480	1826320	And then like we invented cameras and it's like, oh, Jerry Springer can save my marriage.
1826320	1831040	And like, I, like, like, like fame means something.
1831040	1836040	Fame is, fame is important because it's like if you had, if you had a big pile of dollars
1836040	1839520	in your hand, like, and they all said a thousand on them.
1839520	1844200	So you're like, you're walking around this big pile of dollar cake.
1844760	1849920	Then everybody around you knows, well, that person has like something.
1849920	1851320	I could use that to buy food.
1851320	1852600	I could get shelter with that.
1852600	1856160	I could get whatever I want because it's like, that's capitalism.
1856160	1858720	This, this is shit that will get you anything.
1858720	1863560	So like those people then go, well, why don't I just beat him up and take this?
1863560	1867920	The answer is because there's nine dudes standing around me who are like wearing sunglasses
1867920	1872760	because I have so much of this that they all have some and like, why don't they kill me?
1872760	1876520	Well, they don't kill me because if they do, like, they'll just, like, there's another
1876520	1878280	ring outward and outward.
1878280	1879640	So that's the whole system.
1879640	1881840	What was my point?
1881840	1883000	We want to be left alone.
1883000	1887520	Oh, so people, people make this mistake because people because the money came because these
1887520	1892880	people at one point they started going like, okay, let's make a, let's, let's, let's sell
1892880	1896160	everybody just nothing like, like, let's just sell them stories and things.
1896160	1899720	So you make television and movies and then people go like, oh, look at Iron Man.
1899720	1904160	He's ironing today and they're like, like, here's my money and then they go like, thank
1904160	1905160	you for the money.
1905160	1908400	And it's like, like, we're, we're, we're making money off of like, like, like telling you
1908400	1912520	stuff and then the guy on the screen, that guy's famous because you recognize him.
1912520	1915800	If you saw him at the grocery store, he'd be like, holy shit, Iron Man's buying milk,
1915800	1917040	but he doesn't have to buy milk.
1917040	1918600	He has a guy buy milk for him.
1918600	1923680	That's makes it even more exciting to see him fame and seeing famous people.
1923680	1924680	That's obscure.
1924680	1925680	Holy shit.
1925680	1926680	That's so and so over there.
1926680	1929080	I'm never going to see this person ever again in my life.
1929080	1931840	I may even hate him or love him.
1931840	1933040	It doesn't even matter.
1933040	1936920	I just can't leave this room without like something.
1936920	1941520	And if I had that, then I'd also have money and power and all this stuff.
1941520	1943280	But it's not true anymore.
1943280	1947940	Like people tweet you and they go like, hey fat fuck, what are you doing fat fuck?
1947940	1950480	And then you go, hey, fuck you, pipsqueak.
1950480	1951960	And they go, I won.
1951960	1954880	But then they're the it doesn't help them at all.
1954880	1961380	What they call a victory is the mechanic of Twitter functioning as planned.
1961380	1962540	He tweets at you.
1962540	1964120	You see the tweets.
1964120	1965960	That's not that's that's Twitter.
1965960	1966960	That's not a win.
1966960	1967960	Yeah.
1967960	1970760	It's like it's like a it's like a fucking amazing thing about technology.
1970760	1972680	Like you shouldn't you wouldn't like send it.
1972680	1977160	Take an x-ray of your broken leg with your phone and send it to your doctor.
1977160	1981280	And when your doctor says it looks like you have a broken leg owned, you fucking loser.
1981280	1982280	Yeah.
1982880	1986400	Why are you why are you looking at x-rays at home?
1986400	1987400	Fucking faggot.
1992040	1994640	That's faggot shit.
1994640	1999600	Look like a self-employed at home doctor looking at x-rays.
1999600	2003080	He's got a fascination like when they come to you, they interest you.
2006960	2009440	Broken leg winner.
2009440	2010120	Oh, man.
2010120	2010520	OK.
2010520	2012680	I just had the I had this idea.
2012680	2014240	I should have mentioned it before.
2014240	2018680	You know, when people have these mic drop moments, these spike the football moments,
2018680	2022320	it sounds like I was about you were about to do that before I cut you off.
2022320	2029360	But like what you should do when you have that mic drop moment is you should do the NPR sign off like they do.
2029360	2034320	Because, you know, they always end with this awesome or they think it's an awesome line, but it's not.
2034320	2036240	And then they spike the football with their name.
2036240	2041200	They're like, it looks like these ballet shoes are in lock step.
2041200	2045000	I'm Marina Simons, NPR News, Brazil.
2045000	2046000	So.
2048920	2050480	So you just be like,
2052000	2058360	hey, Dan, are those pants brown or did your shit fall out of your pants?
2058360	2061400	I'm Spencer Crittenden, NPR News.
2063520	2065560	I think we should start that.
2065600	2068720	Is that your face or did your neck throw up from Washington?
2068720	2070960	I'm Corey Flintoff.
2070960	2072440	I just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.
2072440	2078600	Yeah, I was just I was doing the same thing, but no, I just wanted to say Corey Flintoff.
2078600	2079600	It's a good name.
2079600	2081560	They're they all have amazing names.
2081560	2085440	That's part of what makes the sign off so powerful because it's not the sign off.
2085440	2087760	You know, they're just saying dumb shit.
2087760	2092080	I don't like because most of the time they sound when they say that when they say their names,
2092080	2094480	it really sounds like they're like, yeah, I really nailed it.
2094480	2096960	But most of the time it's just really lackluster.
2096960	2102160	And it's like it looks like autumn has come to town.
2102160	2104080	I'm Corey Flintoff, NPR News.
2104080	2107040	Like it's just like why that's your I don't know.
2107040	2108280	He sounds so smug.
2108280	2111720	Have you ever been listening to an NPR piece and they did they have that cadence?
2111720	2114000	And so you think it's going to end right.
2114000	2115720	And then it doesn't.
2115720	2117800	And so they go like so.
2117800	2123520	And that's and that's when homelessness becomes something where the heart is.
2124560	2129480	David walks to Dunkin' Tona and you're like, whoa.
2129480	2131040	Yeah, I was ready to move on.
2131040	2132040	Yeah.
2134840	2139920	Let's let's do let's do let's do a segment called My Friend My Friend Needs a Job.
2141880	2143040	Is Marley, are you here?
2143040	2143880	Can you come out of stage?
2143880	2145080	Marley Marley Nelson.
2145080	2146040	It might take him a bit.
2146040	2147440	I think he's in the audience.
2147440	2150880	OK, he can't clamber up the he will, but it just might take a bit.
2150880	2152280	Yeah. Or I hope he will.
2152280	2154320	I don't want to speak for him when he gets here.
2154320	2156600	We're going to give him a job.
2156600	2157400	I know what you're thinking.
2157400	2160760	It's I came here to give.
2160760	2161680	What can I give?
2161680	2164840	I drove from Phoenix.
2164840	2168440	I paid thirty five dollars and I want to engage in charity.
2173280	2176920	Standing in line was my duty.
2176920	2179680	And now begins my obligation.
2179680	2183080	That's what you're thinking.
2183080	2185040	Isn't a duty an obligation?
2185040	2187680	A duty, a duty is a necessity sometimes.
2191680	2193360	Marley, everybody.
2193360	2195520	All right. Hi, Marley.
2199840	2201160	All right, Marley.
2201160	2202600	Marley, I met you because you.
2202600	2204280	Wait, are we also.
2204280	2206040	Should we not say how I met you?
2206040	2207600	Is that. Oh, fuck man.
2207600	2209840	Yeah, that's cool. Yeah.
2209840	2212400	Well, I met you because you were working at the hotel
2212400	2216640	I was staying at and you're you're you're you're
2217120	2218680	you're very hospitable person.
2218680	2221360	And then and then while I was gone at one point,
2221360	2224240	you got fired from the hotel because you weren't.
2224520	2226160	I don't know what the story was.
2226160	2228160	Well, the story was a little complicated.
2228160	2230680	It was one person said this and the other person said that.
2230680	2235840	But essentially, I kind of had sex upstairs and it was frowned upon.
2236000	2240800	Right. Apparently, you can't do that type of thing at work.
2240800	2244200	In a hotel, when there's the only thing that is in a hotel
2244200	2245640	is a bunch of empty beds.
2245640	2246440	That's what I'm saying.
2246440	2249840	If you work in a hotel and you're doing a good enough job,
2250040	2251800	one plus one is two.
2251800	2254160	That's what I mean, like.
2254160	2258120	So that's the first that's the first time you've ever told me that, by the way.
2260760	2263800	I didn't bring him up because I knew the reasoning of fired was awesome.
2266840	2269520	He told he told me he wasn't at his post,
2270440	2272120	but it sounds like you were.
2272120	2274480	I had to keep it professional, you know, like.
2276040	2278160	But I was posting, though, it was it was.
2279280	2282480	All right. So and you were you know, you're
2282840	2285880	if you can make friends with me, it means you're you're
2286880	2288640	you're either black or
2290120	2293080	or you're a very friendly like or both.
2294040	2296080	And if you're both, we're friends.
2297000	2301880	And but but no, but I like, you know, you're you're you seem like a good guy.
2301880	2304640	I don't think that you're secretly a rapist or anything like I.
2305680	2308440	I also I don't think you're a secret murderer.
2308440	2310440	I don't think you're a secret burglar.
2310440	2313560	Oh, no, I'm actually really open and honest about my murder and burglary.
2313600	2316480	So like once I do it, you know, it's it comes through.
2316680	2318080	Yeah. All right.
2318080	2323840	So I talked to you earlier before the show and I got some data like as you put it,
2323840	2327560	because you've you were in the hospitality industry, which you were very good at.
2327880	2332040	Yes, if I could if I could start a hotel, I would have you at the front door.
2332040	2335400	Like, I would know that you were going to make every guest feel wonderful.
2335440	2337640	Oh, yeah, 100 percent. That's the job, man.
2337640	2341040	But you you you went from there to comic book distribution.
2341080	2343560	Yes. And you're currently working in that.
2343560	2345280	You're a big comic book fan.
2345280	2348560	You like Iron Man like Spider-Man. What's your favorite?
2348800	2352120	Oh, that's a complicated question, man. Oh, gosh.
2352760	2354880	Whoo. Probably Dr.
2354880	2359520	Doom and Batman would have to be like the pinnacle of comic book.
2359800	2360600	You like Dr.
2360600	2365160	Doom as I was like a guy you like like his you said earlier.
2366400	2368520	You said this election is like choosing between Dr.
2368520	2370920	Doom and Red Skull.
2373520	2374840	And super. Yeah.
2374840	2377080	Which means like an insidious like.
2377080	2378040	Yeah. Well, OK.
2378040	2380200	But if you want to work, you would work with Dr.
2380200	2382440	Doom because at the end of the day, he's going to take care of you.
2383240	2385560	He's got a lot of area. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
2385560	2388120	You got a lot of area and they're like, oh, we love Doom.
2388120	2390920	Yeah, we have universal health care, education is free.
2390960	2391760	Yeah. Dr.
2391760	2393360	Doom's above board kind of.
2393360	2396680	He really know. He absolutely is like I have a chrome face.
2396720	2397720	I have a country.
2397720	2401200	Some of it's under a hood, but that's because I don't want to look like Destro.
2401280	2406960	Well, well, and but but Red Skull is like, I don't want to know.
2406960	2409280	You know, you know, I have a red skull for my head.
2409880	2411920	I'm going to I'm going to Hydra everything.
2411920	2414400	The dude has a red skull like that that.
2414880	2416400	And he's not proud of it.
2416400	2417560	No, yeah, he's very upset.
2417560	2420040	I don't think that Red Skull was his idea as a name.
2420040	2423520	I think I think he probably was like, I'm Warlock Master.
2424560	2428040	And then like eventually gave in like the way with the big league thing.
2428440	2430040	Bigly became big league.
2430040	2430760	This goes right.
2430760	2432160	We should just stick with what we know.
2432160	2434800	All right. So politics is disturbing.
2434800	2437240	The it's it's it's it's muddying the waters here.
2437240	2439840	It's like it doesn't matter how you feel.
2440160	2443920	What matters is you're you tried hospitality.
2443920	2445840	You're now working a comic book distribution.
2447040	2450760	What you told me, if you had your ideal job, it would be getting high
2450760	2452720	and talking about comics all day.
2452720	2458080	Is there. So is there anybody in New York that is a comic book store?
2458120	2461320	Has a business that involves someone along the pipeline getting high
2461320	2464240	and smoking pot, talking about comic books, guys.
2464240	2465520	I can do this all day.
2465520	2468280	Oh, Dustin owns a podcast network.
2470400	2472000	I guess you could get high and talk about it.
2472000	2475680	Yeah, I mean, you would have to do ads while you got
2475680	2478400	ads for comics. You'd have to like go or comics.
2478400	2480120	Iron Man's dope.
2480120	2481840	And so is Dollar Shave Club.
2481840	2483400	Like you'd have to.
2484400	2487000	Can you imagine like pitching like just comic book
2487000	2489600	superheroes as if they were podcast ads?
2490000	2493000	Like I've been reading Spider-Man for a long time.
2493000	2494520	And I got to tell you, Vada,
2494520	2496000	it's 20 percent off.
2496000	2500240	And Spider-Man has webbing that entangles foes with ease
2500240	2502960	and the strength of six men.
2502960	2504960	I don't know. It would be great.
2504960	2506760	I mean, maybe it wouldn't.
2509480	2514200	All right, so so people listening to this will know Marley, Marley Nelson.
2514480	2516520	Marley Nelson on Facebook.
2516520	2518560	He's he's hot in comics.
2518560	2519960	He's in New York.
2519960	2523360	He needs he's my mom is going to hear this shit, bro.
2525280	2526960	Yeah, he's off.
2526960	2528120	He's off the map.
2528120	2529720	Well, I didn't even think about that.
2529720	2530840	Why is your mom going to hear it?
2530840	2531880	I don't know.
2531880	2534200	I'm I'm I'm kind of like a cool dude.
2534200	2536360	Well, just tell your mom not to your mom.
2536360	2538720	What? Your mom doesn't listen to my podcast.
2539800	2541080	She's your biggest fan.
2541080	2541800	You're excited.
2541800	2545280	You're conflicted because you wanted to tell your mom you were on a podcast.
2545280	2547760	And then you're like, she'll know I get high.
2547760	2551160	Yeah. Well, she like knows, but she doesn't want everyone else to know
2551160	2554360	that she knows. Well, I just put that shit out.
2554360	2556240	Well, we'll cut it out. It'll be fine.
2556240	2558280	This relationship, you need you.
2558280	2560120	You own it, not her.
2560120	2562320	Just don't tell her you're on a podcast.
2562320	2563760	She's never going to find out.
2563760	2565760	I hope not. My rent's going to be all fucked up.
2565760	2570560	Nobody that nobody that knows Martha Nelson from Greenwich Village is going to know.
2572120	2574040	How do you know that name?
2574040	2575640	I love comic books. See that, guys?
2575640	2578040	That was Batman versus Superman. Oh, shit.
2580080	2581720	What? What?
2581720	2586320	What? What do you what do you what do you think of this Bane guy
2586320	2589520	in this Batman movie and that third Batman movie?
2589520	2591560	What did you think of that?
2591560	2593800	Like for real? Oh, yeah, I guess.
2594120	2595520	Let's talk about this.
2595520	2597760	I have opinions, too, but I want to hear yours.
2597760	2601520	I mean, it's a little I mean, it was like it wasn't it wasn't Bane at all.
2601560	2605000	No, I mean, like I get what they were trying to do because they wanted to do
2605000	2607760	was like crazy shit, but that wasn't fucking Bane, bro.
2607760	2609440	Bane's a goddamn mercenary.
2609440	2610960	Has nothing to do with League of Assassins.
2610960	2612400	Broke Batman's back.
2612400	2614680	Did that shit in the whole Nightfall storyline.
2614680	2615600	It was like a whole fucking thing.
2615600	2616720	Nah, that shit was all fucked up.
2616720	2618640	Also, he's super smart, right?
2618640	2622200	Like, like he's a mastermind and that was a really good strategist.
2622200	2624560	But he's not like he's not like Batman level smart.
2624560	2625760	Well, no, Batman. Yeah.
2625760	2626960	No one's Batman level.
2626960	2627640	Well, maybe brain.
2627640	2632200	I don't like the movie begins with the idea that he he's comfortable
2632200	2635240	getting it, putting a hood on and getting on a plane.
2635240	2638240	And he's got this whole plan laid out because he apparently knows
2638240	2642280	exactly what happens when you surrender to the federal government.
2642760	2645040	Like, he knows he's got a hood on his head.
2645040	2646280	You know, when he's hit like that.
2646280	2649640	And he's like, and he's like picking his lips and like, and it's like, oh,
2649640	2654560	well, the parents are you afraid of me?
2654560	2657080	Oh, I'm afraid of you.
2657080	2658960	And it's like, and he's got this hood on.
2658960	2663200	It's like, what if the fucking guy just pointed and blew his brains out
2663200	2664640	like before he had the hood off?
2664640	2666480	He doesn't know that's not going to happen.
2666480	2668120	I don't admire that kind of villain.
2668120	2670400	He doesn't plan things like the Joker.
2670400	2671560	Was it OK? All right.
2671560	2674360	It's just it was just like, oh, the whole thing is like, oh, he's so logical.
2674360	2675640	You got him right where he wants him.
2675640	2677360	But it's like there's no internal logic.
2677360	2678120	I don't like it.
2678120	2681960	I don't like I don't like lack of internal logic in my superhero.
2681960	2683600	In the Joker or Bane?
2683600	2685440	I I mentioned the Joker for a second.
2685440	2688120	Oh, yeah. But he did a good job of creating a character
2688120	2690840	that could be counted on to do anything other than what made sense.
2691080	2693360	Because that was his superpower.
2693360	2697280	Like that was a cool that Heath Ledger Joker was like, we all agree.
2697280	2699320	Like that was well, he was the best part of that movie.
2699320	2703400	Like, yeah, like they finally they made the Joker make sense in that way.
2703400	2706600	It's like, oh, he's like he's a compulsive anarchist.
2706600	2708400	He just wants to watch the world burn.
2708400	2710280	It's like it's kind of cheating, but fine.
2710280	2711040	Fuck it.
2711040	2714640	I. But Bane was like, I've got a plan for Gotham.
2715920	2720520	I'm going to make sure everyone finds out about the corruption.
2720560	2722920	That's way better than the Bane that we had in.
2723920	2727280	I didn't even say this, like, causes me physical discomfort.
2727480	2729360	But I'm going to say it because I love all of you.
2729360	2732360	Oh, Batman and Robin. Right.
2734600	2736200	But it was like that movie.
2736200	2737120	Oh, well, yeah.
2737120	2739480	The Bane in that was just like it was like
2740280	2743120	a slap to the face of everything I've ever known in comic books.
2743120	2745400	It was like almost as bad as Spider-Man's organic.
2745400	2748360	I met I met
2748680	2753320	Adam West at Stan Lee's Kamikaze,
2754320	2756960	but it was very uncomfortable.
2756960	2758640	Why? Because I
2759840	2763960	I told the comic con organizer,
2764520	2768840	she said I heard her going like when Adam West gets here, blah, blah, blah.
2768840	2771360	And I was like, is Adam West here?
2771360	2772880	I'd really like to meet him.
2772880	2776480	And I didn't expect like actually like steps to be taken
2776480	2778960	that involved putting anyone out.
2778960	2783920	And I and then we went to meet Stan Lee, which turns out means that you
2784280	2787000	I kept thinking we were going to be brought into a room.
2787000	2790560	I like it's like, you know, the old the Greg Barents joke of like
2790560	2792720	The New York Times calls him and ask him a few questions
2792720	2794840	and he thinks that he's getting interviewed because
2794840	2796480	but they're just selling him a subscription.
2796480	2799800	Like, I thought I thought Stan Lee wanted to meet me.
2799960	2804160	Like, I was like, Stan Lee would love to have you at his comic con and meet you.
2804160	2805520	And I was like, of course he does.
2805520	2809040	That's my time has come.
2809800	2811200	He's got better shit to do.
2811200	2815040	He's going to be like he's like he's like it was more like, oh, well,
2815080	2817360	you know, the comic con you go in the front of the line
2817360	2819880	and then you meet Stanley is fine.
2819880	2824080	But then they were like, we're walking from the comic con
2824080	2828800	out to the van to leave and this golf cart is speeding up
2828800	2832880	and the comic con organizer leaps into the path of it and flags it down
2833320	2837520	because it's Adam West and Dan Harmon wants to meet Adam West.
2838520	2842680	And so Adam West is like who?
2842680	2848440	And Burt Ward, who's in the back seat, is like double who?
2849360	2852720	Because he didn't say he wanted to meet Adam West and Burt Ward.
2852720	2856400	So even if he's Barack Obama, I don't fucking fucking shit.
2856400	2861160	Well, oh, holy bullshit, me, man.
2863880	2868000	He's like he's in therapy and his therapist is teaching him how to.
2868040	2871120	She's like, when you have anger, I want you to it's OK.
2871160	2873760	You can keep saying holy, whatever is bugging you.
2874160	2876600	But you have I want you to start telling yourself.
2878480	2883800	Instead of Batman, holy divorce, me, man.
2884560	2888280	And that's as far anyways, I thought that was a funny premise.
2888280	2892040	I'm not doing myself any favors because the guy doesn't have any reason to like me.
2892400	2895920	Someone stopped a golf cart and then it was like there was just the whole golf
2895920	2900320	cart was loaded with the entire cast of the Batman original TV show.
2900840	2905000	I didn't really I didn't I was like if Adam went and then I was like, Adam,
2905320	2907680	it was it was they were like, they're they're busy.
2907800	2912560	And I found myself angry at them like and I'm like, why am I mad at them?
2912600	2915160	Like, and I was also ashamed of myself because I'm like what?
2915280	2917560	And it was like, oh, my God, I meet people every day
2917560	2920160	who are going through all this shit not to flatter myself.
2920160	2923160	I'm just saying like, like I was like, oh, this is always happening.
2923320	2925200	It's like, oh, people going like I also met
2927560	2932800	Walter Koenig and I just watched him and Bruce Campbell in Moon.
2933040	2936320	What was the fucking movie called Moon Escape?
2936360	2939760	What an awful movie from the 80s and Walter Koenig's in it.
2939840	2944120	I couldn't I couldn't fucking I was like, why am I telling him this?
2944120	2945320	Like, it's a shitty movie.
2945320	2947800	He knows it's shitty, like, like it's embarrassing.
2947800	2949600	And it's like and I knew it the whole time.
2949600	2951240	I had 20 minutes to stew on it.
2951240	2953640	And then I and I ended that 20 minutes and go and said,
2955440	2959000	sir, I had to say it, but I know it's you know, it's all that.
2959240	2962600	I know this is a big annoyance and all this stuff, but I have to say,
2962600	2965240	I just watched the shitty movie you were in, you know, yesterday,
2965240	2966680	whatever the name of it was.
2966680	2969800	And it just stared at me blankly.
2969800	2971240	I'm like, yeah, of course.
2971240	2973400	Like, what do you expect of it?
2973400	2974840	It makes me feel sad.
2974840	2978240	Anyways, the elections are
2978240	2983160	happening and let's sorry about that detour.
2984000	2987280	I'd like to bring her name is Stephanie to the stage.
2987280	2989520	Stephanie, are you are you here able to come to stage?
2991160	2993240	I hope so.
2993240	2995720	We met Marley and I were
2998480	3000360	Marley's mom.
3000360	3001160	Stop listening, mom.
3001160	3003040	Your son and I were getting high outside the
3004040	3007160	venue and then a couple walked by and
3008000	3013760	and we started we struck up a conversation and the the wife,
3013760	3015520	I think she's I think they're married.
3015520	3019640	She was just walking her husband to Harman Town and she was going to stand in line
3019640	3022280	with him until until he got to the front of the line.
3022280	3024440	And then she didn't have a ticket and she was going to go home
3024440	3027920	because she was just going to support him because he's a Harman Town fan.
3027920	3031320	So he's not capable of existing on his own on a sidewalk.
3032320	3041720	Yeah, it's Jeff. Stephanie, we have a seat and take that mic.
3041720	3045240	I'm sure you're you're probably I don't want to I don't want to assume this,
3045240	3047280	but I also want to support you if you are.
3047800	3051640	You're terrified or you're nervous or anxious or it's is this
3051720	3053800	is this a normal thing to be in front of?
3053800	3055080	You've been in front of people before?
3055080	3056120	Yeah. OK, good.
3056120	3059080	Fine. Fuck you. All right.
3059680	3061680	But we talked about you.
3061680	3065920	We I don't know how it came up, but the idea that you you can beatbox
3066120	3069680	just a little bit like you're not you're not claiming expertise.
3069680	3073840	No, you're not you're not here to take down any sucker emcees.
3073880	3075960	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3075960	3077840	If that's if that's what beatboxers do.
3079440	3081400	I don't know in their elaborate chess
3082640	3086840	game, like what if the beatboxer is allowed to take down a sucker emcee?
3087200	3089520	That may be something that only a queen can do.
3089520	3093360	Or indeed, whether or not they have anything on you. Right. Right.
3093880	3096200	That was good. I stand by that.
3098000	3101440	Well, can we can we can we get just a little taste?
3101640	3104040	Is there anything I can do to make it more comfortable for you?
3104040	3106440	Do you want some water, some vodka?
3107520	3109160	I'm good. OK, yeah. All right.
3109160	3113120	Well, just a little it's a experimental just a little beatboxing.
3117840	3120760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3121000	3123040	No, Dan, they ain't ready for this one.
3123040	3124760	Yeah, you ready for this one?
3124760	3127440	Give it up. Oh, shit.
3128280	3130120	Oh, man, give it to a man.
3130120	3131960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3131960	3135520	New York, New York, big city.
3135880	3137200	A tiny apple.
3137200	3139360	I fucked your mom and she gave me some Snapple.
3140000	3141920	She gave it to me on a vending machine.
3141920	3144840	I fucked it so hard that one leg cleans.
3145760	3147800	And then I took her to dinner.
3147800	3150800	I'd call your mom a gender winner.
3150800	3154760	She's an example to us all because I didn't fuck her at all.
3154800	3157640	I was lying. And I'm a weak man.
3157640	3160160	And your your mama should lead this land.
3160200	3163320	She's put up with enough and she's shown she has merit.
3164160	3166640	I'd fuck your mom before a ferret.
3172440	3174800	That's not easy to keep up, right?
3175360	3177360	I can't.
3177360	3181760	I can't wait beatboxing filled my hallways in eighth grade.
3181760	3184360	It was it was it was my generation's doo wop.
3185800	3189400	It was I went to I went to a virtually all black middle school.
3189400	3190800	I'm not looking at you, Marley.
3190800	3193760	I've said the word black.
3193760	3195600	I think I don't see the world through that lens.
3195600	3198000	I don't connect those dots.
3198000	3201440	Thank you. I went to I went to basically all black middle school.
3201440	3204920	And it was like it was like one of like just a half dozen kids
3204920	3208240	that have been but were bussed in to for the computer specialty.
3209080	3212760	They I remember they call magnet schools or desegregation traps or whatever.
3213200	3215360	But I'm not. That wasn't a joke.
3215360	3217400	I mean, those those were those language.
3217400	3219600	I went to a magnet school.
3219600	3221400	Is that was that magnet school? Is that what that is?
3221400	3223880	Yeah, it's like they take inner city schools and then they go,
3223880	3226840	this inner city school is now the agriculture specialty.
3227200	3230920	And there's just like like nine guys from Wichita get off the go like I'm here.
3230920	3232520	Wait, why would they come from a different? OK.
3234080	3236280	Wichita was overused in the last show.
3236400	3238040	I don't know anything about geography.
3238040	3239320	If you're in Wichita, I'm sorry.
3239320	3241400	I couldn't point at you on a map.
3241400	3243640	You're fine. You're fine. You're a fine human being.
3245120	3247120	Why am I characterizing you as anything other than a
3248920	3250720	an example of humanity?
3250720	3252720	You're a good person.
3253800	3256800	Where was I was? Oh, all black junior.
3257080	3258440	Yeah. So everywhere.
3258440	3262400	So you just walk down the hall between classes and just literally like
3262800	3266840	three dudes, any three dudes, like it was like it was like
3266840	3271000	there'd be one guy like freestyling and then like maybe trading off of this.
3271080	3272440	There was it was like triplets.
3272440	3276520	It was like like and then like so I would I kind of learned.
3276880	3279280	I learned to beatbox a little bit, too.
3280240	3281880	That's that's that was my only point.
3281880	3284600	Why do you know how to be? Oh,
3285600	3289880	I for my first exposure to beatboxing was Razzell, of course.
3289880	3293360	So I just YouTube videos was Razzell, of course.
3293360	3295720	I don't know what Razzell just Razzell.
3295720	3297960	OK, comma, of course.
3297960	3301280	Oh, no, I know you said the of course is what puzzles me because the of course
3301280	3303600	implies I should know who Razzell is.
3303600	3305920	And I don't I don't know. Oh, I'm sorry.
3305920	3308720	OK, well, so he was like one of the pioneers of beatboxing.
3310120	3312600	What about the human beatbox and the fat boys?
3312600	3314920	Was I always assumed he was the first beatbox
3315000	3317480	because his name was the human beatbox. Right.
3318000	3319640	Yeah, there was was there someone before him?
3319640	3323760	He had a he had a person who was almost literally his Razzell Ghoul.
3325400	3327240	That was his name. That was good.
3327240	3329400	That was almost Razzell Ghoul.
3330360	3332160	I also noticed that. Yeah.
3332160	3335680	Yeah, it goes into the whole Razz Rache dispute.
3335680	3337320	Then you have like people fighting and stuff
3337320	3340840	because some people say Rache Algol, some people say Razzel Ghoul.
3340880	3341760	I hate that stuff.
3341760	3344880	It's fucking annoying. I just like fuck off.
3345160	3347280	They should spell it differently if they want you to say it,
3347280	3348520	not like the letters are.
3348520	3350480	Exactly. Exactly.
3350960	3353360	If it's Rache Al Ghoul, there's a goddamn H at the end.
3353360	3357160	There's all sorts of letters they could use that they're not. Yeah. Sorry.
3360800	3361920	A C maybe.
3361920	3364280	Are you did this Razzell guy?
3364280	3367240	He predate. Was he like the actual pioneer of beatboxing?
3367480	3371720	No, no, no. He was just the first person I saw like online.
3372560	3373920	What era was he?
3373920	3378160	He was the 90s, late 80s, early 90s, mostly.
3378160	3380160	Yeah, early 80s, early 90s.
3380160	3384360	It would be, you know, you got Busy B, obviously Dougie Fresh,
3384360	3386280	then yes, Big Buff Love.
3386280	3389080	There was a lot in the late 70s and early 80s doing a lot of beatboxing.
3389080	3391400	Dougie Fresh was doing his own beatboxing.
3391400	3394120	And then he was like, the only thing I know is him and Slick Rick.
3394120	3395720	Slick Rick. Yeah, yeah.
3395720	3398040	Children's Story, Mona Lisa. Yeah, they killed that shit.
3398880	3399960	OK, so all right.
3399960	3404480	So I think that's I think that's the end of my questions, I think.
3405440	3407880	Because we don't we know the same amount about beatboxing.
3407880	3409560	I'm a bad interviewer.
3415560	3417000	Yeah, but she was really good.
3417000	3419200	Did we ever find out? Remember?
3419200	3420800	Yeah, no, for sure.
3420800	3423640	Yeah, I'll show you guys this. I I'm a.
3423640	3427440	Is the sound is the sound going to be audible?
3427440	3430360	Well, whatever, we'll find out. Yeah.
3430360	3433840	I I I staying in a hotel with my girlfriend and.
3435840	3438720	We fart in front of each other now, but like I.
3441520	3443520	Oh, I don't know what that is.
3443520	3444120	God damn it.
3444120	3449440	I'm so scared we're going to just find Steve Steve Levy's The Fall Journal.
3449440	3454160	And it's just I just I was so dread,
3454160	3458000	like just the hand sketches women's hair going over their shoulder.
3458840	3462520	Just a red marker across the eyes or something.
3463800	3466920	Anyways, I maybe I maybe I tipped here.
3467360	3472040	I I still like I try not to fight in front of her, try to go in the bathroom and.
3474400	3477560	You know, sometimes if I feel like it's going to be a loud one, I'll turn on the water.
3477960	3483000	And I think I got away with this one and I wanted to share it with you.
3484680	3486720	Oh, shit. OK.
3490200	3492200	That's the water going on.
3507920	3510480	I don't think she heard it.
3512080	3515080	I don't see she was sound asleep.
3517200	3518360	That was a really good one, though.
3518360	3521720	That was that was a solid eight, solid eight.
3523600	3525720	I think my hesitant.
3531480	3533600	It's it had an M sound is like.
3534960	3537520	It wasn't like a it's not percussive.
3537640	3540360	It's not like it wasn't like a groaning barrel.
3540360	3545960	It was like, yeah, it has something to say.
3552200	3554600	Oh, shit. Play that again. Play that again.
3554600	3557120	I think I know what it's saying.
3560760	3563120	No, I didn't. I got it wrong.
3563120	3568400	You thought you thought it was like a desalinization of seawater.
3568640	3570360	Like it was like a secret.
3570360	3573560	Yeah, yeah. But no, I just I had an idea.
3573560	3575720	And then that was just the lowest common denominator.
3575720	3577640	So I jettisoned.
3578440	3579640	I mean, he's a happy guy.
3579640	3583480	Remember that, you know, for those of you that were at the last show,
3583480	3586040	you know, there was some question about my level of happiness.
3586040	3588800	And I I think this is a happy person.
3588880	3595520	I think it's foolish to to characterize me as having personality disorders.
3595520	3597600	And that actually got to me a little bit.
3597600	3599360	I don't know how many of you were at the thing.
3599360	3604680	I that we as a joke, we googled me and we ended up at this
3604960	3607280	art and it was like, oh, Dan Harman's a piece of shit
3607280	3611640	because he yelled at a kid on Twitter and like read the whole article and read the comments.
3611800	3616920	I walked away the comment section and I was like, yeah, I'm I'm fine with this.
3616920	3617960	I'm fine with all of it.
3617960	3620600	I'm like and then I like I noticed through the rest of the night,
3620600	3622160	I was like actually really bummed out.
3622160	3624640	I was like, like it was like on me.
3624640	3626960	It was in me like it's toxicity.
3626960	3627760	It spreads.
3627760	3635480	So are you supposed to are you supposed to confront the things that make you feel bad
3635480	3639000	or are you supposed to because that just made me feel bad in a little bit?
3639000	3641400	I think you're supposed to, you know, just kind of filter it.
3641400	3645640	You're kind of you have to remove that toxicity from the universe,
3645640	3646960	you know, using yourself.
3646960	3649880	Kind of like process it through and like filter it out
3649880	3653960	and like expel that shit, you know, like acknowledge it and then like,
3653960	3655480	fuck you, you're a piece of shit.
3655480	3659040	I don't have to answer to you and like, oh, he did that for hours.
3659040	3660640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3660640	3663120	Yeah, that's why I'm playing hot, you know, chill out.
3668920	3670960	The proudest thing to me is that the finger.
3672560	3676280	It's like I'm the thing that's so meta because I'm like,
3676280	3679520	I think for a moment about being adorable.
3681440	3685280	But the thing about being adorable is that it's all about hesitation.
3685280	3690440	Like that's that's an image of oh, should I should I strike a hesitant pose?
3690440	3693480	And then I was like, I don't I hesitate to do that.
3693480	3696600	So I'm like, quadruped, adorable.
3706280	3710400	Don't you think that women are heroes?
3710400	3716480	Like, aren't they just better people?
3716480	3718680	Because isn't that gross?
3718680	3723360	And can you imagine like, like either she was asleep or she ignored it or she
3723360	3727120	she loves me like she like she acts like it's fun.
3727120	3729040	Like like she loves it.
3729040	3730840	She and I farted on a candle together.
3733360	3734920	That is that is fucking lovely.
3734920	3735720	I like that.
3735840	3740200	I was like I was I was trying to fart on a candle for her for her entertainment.
3740200	3742120	And then I was like thrusting out.
3742120	3743360	I was really wanted to.
3743360	3747200	And then I and then I heard a weird sound and I looked back and she had
3747200	3749680	creeped out of bed and was like on the other side of the.
3751440	3754080	That's amazing. Yeah.
3754080	3756600	I mean, it's hard to it's hard to define love.
3758720	3761480	You can't just say I feel like you just did.
3761480	3762280	I love you.
3762600	3765800	You have to like it all comes in the form of like specific things.
3765800	3766800	And that wouldn't be the same.
3766800	3770040	Like that's not Bridget Jones's definition of love.
3771040	3773200	I haven't seen the third movie, but I don't know.
3773200	3774240	I don't think it changes.
3774240	3776280	I don't think she wants someone to fart on a candle with her.
3778400	3782280	Stephanie, what's it like being with a Harmontown fan?
3783560	3785760	It's awesome. He's the best.
3787600	3788480	I love him.
3788600	3794520	I mean, he's introduced me to he's made he's helping me appreciate humor more.
3794520	3797160	He's more funny than me by a long shot.
3798000	3801240	I've been getting into improv lately, which I'm not so great at.
3802920	3805440	And it sounds like he's got some kind of gaslight like
3808280	3809920	stock. Yeah.
3809920	3814000	Stepford thing. Yeah, I bet you're better than him in every way.
3815960	3818440	He sounds like a terrible person.
3819440	3822120	Yeah, that's what makes people funny.
3823120	3825240	Terrible people are funny people.
3825240	3827040	Yeah. Right.
3834680	3837280	I fucking love myself.
3837280	3840960	Well, why am I so happy?
3842400	3845400	I like I love I love I love how old I'm getting.
3845400	3848400	I love I love how gross I am.
3848520	3850120	I'm like, oh, yeah, that was guy.
3850120	3853320	I always wanted to be this is who I was in kindergarten.
3854920	3856680	And the principal didn't understand that.
3856680	3858800	So he was like, you should be held back.
3858800	3860720	You should you can't move on to first grade. Why?
3860720	3861760	Because you can't use scissors.
3861760	3864000	Well, either can this guy.
3864880	3867120	Like you're I'm not supposed to use scissors.
3867120	3871160	I'm supposed to fucking fart in a bathroom like look like adorable.
3871360	3876400	I was noticing how your brow like lacks any wrinkles in this video.
3876880	3879240	On a daily basis, I have like at least three.
3879440	3882480	And especially while like concentrating.
3882520	3884360	What do you mean in the middle? Yeah.
3884360	3888880	Is that is that a I got I got a line there.
3888920	3891000	Is that is that like a big zone for women?
3891000	3892840	Like, do you? It's a cross.
3892840	3896240	It's a it's these lines across because that'll make you look that's
3896240	3899360	that's the definition of all like I played an old woman in a play.
3899360	3901840	And then that was my job as I got lazy.
3902240	3904840	Like the less I spent in makeup, I would
3905440	3908160	I would just take an eyebrow pencil and go line, line, line.
3908200	3911920	So it's like that's what you're avoiding is horizontal lines.
3911920	3916480	Yeah. And that's normally unavoidable, especially in this delicate situation.
3917200	3919760	And you manage to not have a single.
3919880	3922040	Well, every night, cucumber slices.
3924960	3927080	Then I get up and I let it all out.
3931880	3933680	What is it? So what is it?
3933680	3936680	Are you what do you do you want to talk just a little bit about politics?
3936680	3940200	But more on the spiritual side, because I know like I was at a table
3940200	3944000	last night with like three women, three dudes.
3944000	3948480	And then one of the dudes was a young harmontown fan
3948480	3950960	who came to the table and like made the mistake
3950960	3954240	of telling Evan Shapiro, head of CISO, that he wasn't voting.
3954760	3957200	And you guys are here. Yeah, OK.
3958320	3959440	Don't don't get a big head.
3959440	3960880	You're not a hero in the story. No, no, you're right.
3960880	3962080	So it's fine. You're fine.
3962080	3963560	You're you're a lamb to the slaughter.
3963560	3967440	I like why it's like Evan Shapiro is like, oh, my God, you're not going to vote.
3967440	3971240	And it's like, I'm like, oh, like I like I sympathize with everybody.
3971240	3974240	But the funny thing is that it was a bunch of dudes, one of them yelling,
3974760	3977680	everybody laughing. Then of all this talking and all this stuff.
3977680	3982000	And I just like my girlfriend and two other women were the other half of the table.
3982000	3986600	And it was kind of like I picked up like a couple of like sound bites
3987440	3989160	that it's like.
3990520	3993160	It's it's as if women are going through something right now
3993160	3996800	where it's like they're all looking at each other going like, do you fucking believe
3997400	4000880	like like like like does it no matter how they feel?
4000880	4002720	They're just like, does anyone not?
4002720	4004360	I don't know. Like what is it?
4004360	4007040	Can you give voice to that so that I'm not mansplaining it or?
4007880	4012720	Yeah, well, I mean, as a human, I don't I don't know about how my woman status plays
4012720	4015760	into it, but as a human, I'm looking at this election going like, what the hell?
4015760	4017800	How did how how did this happen?
4018440	4021640	How did how did this crazy person get so far?
4022680	4026080	And so but do you do you get mad when people are?
4027040	4029960	Is there something inside you that's like is it frustrating
4030840	4033880	because it's everybody's argument to have everybody's decision?
4033880	4036520	Is it frustrating because does it feel a little bit like.
4037640	4040960	This is this is this is my time.
4040960	4042440	This is my space.
4042440	4046080	This is this is not really in the grand scheme of elections.
4046080	4049280	Can you fucking pick up this bullshit some other time?
4049280	4052920	And can we get this over with where we make this historic important step?
4052920	4054680	Is that do you ever?
4054680	4056760	I don't know. I don't want to put words or thoughts in your mouth.
4056760	4059760	And I don't know if maybe that might offend you, that you're like,
4059760	4063960	I'm characterizing he was blinded by a pheromone, like fucking higher calling.
4063960	4065320	I don't know.
4065320	4066600	Just just save the show.
4066600	4068120	Tell us where you're at.
4069120	4069880	Yeah, no pressure.
4069880	4071800	Speak for all women and get a standing ovation.
4071800	4073720	Yeah, OK.
4073720	4076600	Back into the goal of a standing ovation from all women.
4076880	4078680	And then just imagine what would I say to get that?
4081520	4082040	I'm kidding.
4082040	4085040	Obviously, that's a terrible way to approach creativity.
4086560	4090040	So the alternative is you just say how you actually feel
4090320	4094640	and knowing that someone might out there might like put a Reddit post
4094640	4097040	and say like, she's got a lot of nerve.
4098720	4100760	If you're willing to risk that, just say
4100840	4102320	you can just say how you feel.
4102320	4107520	I do appreciate that the dialogue on women has become so much more
4107520	4110160	the forefront of everything right now.
4110160	4114240	And for once, people are angry at the things that Donald Trump
4114240	4117200	and like are saying, which is huge.
4117840	4120920	Just the fact that there are so many women and men coming out and saying
4121280	4125960	that's so not OK, it's it's so not OK that we would actually vote
4125960	4129760	for someone of the opposite party, for example, based on just these comments,
4129760	4132440	level and policy and all those other issues that are nasty.
4132840	4135040	I don't even know what's going on with Republican women.
4136720	4139640	That already sounded like an oxymoron before this election.
4139640	4143720	Like, but then again, somebody's somebody's a Republican woman.
4143720	4145720	Like, they exist. There's lots of them, right?
4145720	4147080	Yeah, I don't know what the numbers were,
4147080	4149440	but you've been paying more attention to that than me.
4149440	4157200	Has there been a huge exodus from GOP women to that are saying like,
4157200	4160840	this guy is the worst and it has to do with who I am.
4161400	4165760	Like, like, like the fuck fiscal policy, fuck class struggle,
4165760	4171640	fuck cultural shock, like I for this four years, I'm with hers.
4171640	4174320	You've seen that.
4175360	4178760	So in my social circles, I generally congregate
4178760	4182440	with liberal women and liberal men who are like minded.
4183440	4187440	But from my readings in the Washington Post,
4187440	4193880	I see more and more women of every political leaning saying,
4194880	4196320	you know, I'm with her.
4196320	4197720	He's a pig. Yeah.
4197720	4199720	All right. Well, it's too late.
4199720	4200920	There's nothing we can do about it.
4200920	4203320	Look at those airs after the apocalypse.
4207320	4208840	All we can really do is...
4212440	4221280	In like a lamb, out like a lion.
4224160	4227240	Look how happy I am.
4227240	4229600	It's like I don't know the world is at stake.
4231520	4232680	Is this guy even going to vote?
4232680	4233920	Look at his face.
4233920	4237000	This guy may not even vote.
4237000	4240200	He may just get out one of his old stickers from the drawer.
4242800	4244400	It's just to just to stick on it.
4244400	4246040	So it's like, oh, there's a lot of lint on it.
4246040	4249200	So scotch tape behind it.
4249200	4252480	This is from this is from the nadir election.
4254600	4257840	Still still stick straight to my shirt.
4257840	4259960	Now, I'm going to yeah.
4259960	4263040	I mean, I'm I'm I'm going to go and I'm going to pull the lever
4263040	4265960	like very proudly for somebody that,
4266480	4271080	in spite of all my political opinions which are left of anarchy,
4271920	4274680	like, which means I wish that everybody that ever thought
4274680	4277800	they had the right to tell us what to do would die in a fucking inferno.
4279320	4281400	Like, so who do you vote for?
4281400	4282440	The Green Party?
4282440	4283920	I don't like them either.
4283920	4288640	I know there's got to be a better way, but I also don't.
4288760	4292560	I don't like the look on people's faces if I tell them I didn't vote.
4292560	4295640	And like, like, like the pot, you know, like posturing about
4295640	4297800	how the system isn't going to work and all this stuff.
4297800	4302000	Like, I I would never, ever, ever tell anybody
4302480	4305400	that she was choosing to like write in their roommate
4305840	4308840	or vote for a third party candidate or even not to go vote.
4308840	4311960	Like at the point where you're bullying those people,
4311960	4315520	you've got to step back and ask yourself, like, like, all they're saying
4315520	4319080	is they're not voting for this particular fucking system.
4319320	4322360	And if you're only advertisement for it is to yell at them.
4322640	4325160	Like, like, what do you expect them to do?
4325400	4327120	Oh, yeah. So sorry.
4327120	4330040	Like, like, if you if you want them to be a fan of democracy,
4330120	4333200	at least give them the space to waste their vote.
4333200	4336040	Like, like, that should be their right.
4336040	4337240	And I'm going to.
4337240	4339480	But I always like go.
4339480	4341800	I'm going to go pull the lever for the Democratic candidate
4341800	4344360	because like this fucking guy is an emergency.
4344360	4347560	And I resent the fact that I should be tending to an emergency
4347560	4348880	with my fucking vote.
4348880	4351560	That shouldn't be my vote's job like like.
4353160	4356560	So I'm like, but it's not the time to protest
4356560	4361880	because both voting and protest voting aren't going to make a fucking difference.
4361880	4363120	That's the problem.
4363120	4365440	Revolution doesn't happen behind that curtain.
4366280	4370160	If it was anything behind that curtain was could happen that was powerful,
4370160	4372960	it would have been made illegal a long time ago.
4373960	4377560	And so but I'm going to go do it out of solidarity.
4377960	4380640	And then I'm like, we got to fucking for real.
4380640	4384160	We got to like figure out how to how to get to like, we got to
4384160	4390800	get we get we got to fix this.
4390800	4393200	We got to like if you're if you're if you're a human being and you're like
4393200	4396560	living within the system, like you have the right to go stand out on the street
4396560	4398320	corner and say, I don't like the system.
4398320	4399240	I think it should change.
4399240	4403200	And if somebody comes and stuns you with a taser and like puts you in a van,
4403480	4408240	then that that that you've done your job that day like like there
4408240	4413000	because you've proven like like like when we give AIDS to cancer,
4413000	4416600	as we talked about in a previous episode, you're alerting white blood
4416600	4418800	cells to an issue to a thing that should be fought.
4420080	4423120	And we'll get started on that after after Tuesday.
4423120	4426160	Like we got to we got to just go like, OK, that's great.
4426160	4427880	Historical. She's president.
4427880	4429800	Like now let's fix this shit.
4429800	4431280	These people are born rich.
4431280	4434200	They have no fucking entitlement to talk to us like animals.
4434440	4436840	We've got to have representative democracy.
4436840	4438440	And then just.
4438440	4445360	It's so proud of it, like, look at me.
4447880	4450160	Look at there's a woman that loves him.
4451800	4453680	And she's gorgeous.
4453680	4455960	She's amazing looking.
4455960	4459080	That's not why I like her.
4459080	4465040	I noticed how hot she was, like three conversations into making intellectual
4465040	4466840	love to her.
4469440	4471680	Was that do I protest too much?
4471680	4473240	That's beautiful. OK.
4473240	4474680	All right. Give me a beat box.
4474680	4475680	Let's do a New York rap.
4475680	4479640	And then and I want to I want to look like
4480200	4482640	wait five. Wait, what time is it?
4482640	4485080	Five. It says five o'clock on here.
4485080	4488280	What? You know, for the show started.
4488280	4490400	It's OK. Right. Great. This is good.
4490400	4492360	We're doing good. It's kind of an OK show.
4494360	4495320	Yeah, OK. All right.
4495320	4497920	That response was telling.
4497920	4500120	We'll figure it out.
4500120	4503520	Sorry. Well, you know, then then go back in time and don't come.
4505280	4507120	You can't, can you?
4510920	4513480	Give me a beat box and we'll do a little New York rap and then
4514440	4518080	make that seat available for somebody from the city that's feeling pain.
4519840	4521440	Or pleasure.
4525320	4532320	Yo, yo, 103rd Street to 65th took the subway down
4532320	4536440	and I smoked a spliff of reefer weed.
4536960	4539160	I fucked your mama because she was in need.
4539160	4543120	I'm a charitable contributor to your mama's pussy
4544720	4549720	with my dick and my balls every summer, spring, winter and fall.
4550280	4552760	I put my penis in her vagina
4553360	4556360	from New York to North Carolina.
4556960	4560280	The Eastern Seaboard is your mama's pussy.
4568720	4570200	The Eastern Seaboard is your mama's
4570200	4573920	and I was like one syllable for vagina, nothing acceptable.
4576320	4579120	No, there's no such thing as a one syllable word for vagina.
4579120	4582120	That's like it was going to like end your rap.
4582120	4586760	Well, we should come up with one.
4586800	4589720	Bob, I'm pitching.
4589720	4594600	Just call it Bob, Bob, Bob, oh, no, box is gross.
4596040	4598440	It's all it's all gross if it's one syllable, I think.
4599320	4601680	Is there a one syllable word for countries?
4601680	4605680	What we know, those ones countries all the way over into like refreshing.
4605680	4610600	Like it's like the N word of vaginas, veg. Come on, gang.
4612760	4614640	Gash. No, I mean, are you kidding?
4614640	4615720	Do you hear yourself?
4615720	4620480	I didn't ask is I didn't I wasn't saying, hey, name.
4622160	4623880	I know they exist.
4623880	4627760	My question is, are there ones that make us feel comfortable?
4629120	4630160	That is fine.
4630160	4633160	That is that just I'm not I'm never saying it.
4634160	4637640	But that's that's for bridal showers.
4637640	4638840	Badge seems OK.
4638840	4640040	I'll let you ladies.
4640040	4642400	How about that went back to people say slip.
4642640	4644280	That's gross, too.
4644280	4645640	Wait, was that was that bad?
4645640	4648520	I don't know. I think it's I think it's just gross.
4648520	4650840	No, it's like if you called it mud or something.
4650840	4652920	It's like no one wants to do that.
4652920	4655280	Who doesn't like to play in some mud?
4655280	4658160	I mean, well, without question.
4659920	4662360	Yeah, there's no it should be like it should be.
4662360	4665000	There should be one that's like Earth or.
4666320	4668120	Like, I guess that's that's much whole.
4668120	4669200	Yeah, that's not bad.
4669200	4671600	Did you say poll poll poll poll?
4671600	4673520	No, whole with an H.
4673520	4674520	No, a whole is bad.
4674520	4676080	Whole is a thing you put stuff in.
4676080	4678080	Yes, I know. I get it.
4679360	4682520	The rug. What? The rug rug.
4682520	4684640	All right, if you're just going to boo everything like I'm just.
4686280	4687960	I thought slit and rug were really good.
4687960	4690000	Like, oh, I mean, slits clever.
4690000	4690840	It's just I don't know.
4690840	4694360	It's just saying it's like moist, dirty dirty dirty.
4694360	4696720	It's not like it's green.
4696720	4698640	That's like the most important part.
4699560	4700440	Here's my pitch.
4700440	4702600	OK, you're going to you're going to say I'm white knighting.
4703000	4706080	Here it is for real pitch, because imagine using this in slang.
4706080	4708280	It would be awesome. Life.
4710400	4712560	Yo, yo, son, you get some of that life.
4714000	4716000	No, I was all over that life.
4716000	4717760	Last night, you get that life.
4717760	4720120	Yeah, that's actually the worst guys got.
4720320	4723160	And then it was like, yeah, like we get it.
4723800	4725760	It's life. That's why we want.
4725760	4727760	Yeah. And like, like it's still gross.
4727760	4732440	But like, because we're objectifying it, but we're at least like cosmology,
4734400	4738120	placing it like it's like, yo, yo, yo, yo, son, you get some of that life.
4740320	4745960	So I a lady called out a lady called out that holes don't have agency.
4746720	4748160	Oh, they do.
4748160	4749400	They don't. They don't.
4749400	4751080	They should. How how would we?
4751080	4753520	They should. They should.
4753520	4756240	But I think we could give.
4756240	4759320	But we can make that happen.
4759960	4761920	How would you give a whole agency, though?
4761920	4763920	Well, oh, oh, linguistically, you mean?
4764320	4766440	Well, like a Sarlock Pit, like, I mean.
4768720	4770520	Right. It's like a gatekeeper in that.
4770520	4773240	You could. How do you give a whole agency?
4773240	4775640	Well, I mean, yeah, you put a door on it.
4777240	4778400	You put a door on it.
4778400	4779320	Yeah, then it's a hole.
4779320	4781240	It's not just like something that can be affected.
4781240	4786200	Then it's like, you know, I think older men than us have come up with these solutions.
4787040	4794280	You should put a door with a lock and then a like it's made of iron and.
4795800	4797840	Uh, yeah, I don't know.
4797840	4800680	Yeah. Well, what? No, I look, I'm putting it out there.
4801040	4803680	It's not going to come from me.
4806680	4809520	You you you female harmonians go figure it out.
4809760	4810800	That's what you do.
4810800	4815160	You create. Create a one syllable word for your vagina.
4816320	4817800	Make it beautiful.
4817800	4819520	I'm counting on you.
4819520	4821240	I believe in you.
4821240	4823360	My name is Dan Harmon and I approve this message.
4826040	4830200	I don't think my irony landed and a lot of people started hating me.
4830680	4833000	They're like, is he telling women what to do?
4834040	4836080	No, I'm I'm scared of you.
4838080	4839360	Did he just say he was scared of us?
4839360	4841600	That's not comforting either.
4841600	4844640	That's what they say before shooting sprays.
4845640	4847480	OK. Noted.
4849840	4852480	Split the diff.
4852480	4854680	Give me a break. Well, yeah.
4859520	4862480	OK, never mind, never mind.
4864880	4868640	OK, let's have a hand for Stephanie for her beatboxing.
4870080	4872920	You can go rejoin your.
4875000	4878800	See, thank you.
4878800	4880280	So I'm glad we ran into each other.
4880280	4883400	I mean, like the the we live in an alternate universe now
4883400	4885600	where you came to the show instead of going home.
4885600	4887640	Who knows what you would have done?
4887640	4888600	She's ignoring me.
4888600	4889600	Yeah.
4892520	4894440	That's a tasty beatbox for a stranger.
4894440	4895520	That was really good.
4895520	4896640	She said she did it.
4896640	4898240	She kind of knew how to beatbox.
4898240	4899600	I mean, come on. That's a.
4899600	4902840	I wanted to tell you, you got to understand, like she did not like
4903440	4906560	like she was not like, well, can I be on stage?
4906560	4910200	Like I definitely totally like descended on her and was like,
4910200	4911000	that would be fun.
4911000	4914280	And she was like, oh, like so, just so you know.
4916160	4917520	OK, so all right.
4917520	4921760	Let's let's let's mine New York for a non 9-11 related.
4924240	4926880	Probably non election related.
4926880	4929800	It's 8-11. Yeah, it's 8-11. OK.
4933080	4935800	If not for daylight savings, it would be 9-11.
4943360	4946800	It's it's more meaningful because it involves remembering.
4950160	4954320	The remembering is built in to the 8-11 commemoration.
4955320	4958200	It's like part 9-11, part memorial.
4960440	4962640	I agree.
4962640	4964680	Is it is it anybody?
4964680	4966240	Anybody here?
4966240	4968120	Let's say I want to ask for something specific.
4968120	4969600	You guys are so polite and nice.
4969600	4970960	Like you've been you've been great.
4970960	4971920	Like it's New York.
4971920	4974440	They function as a as a as an entity.
4974960	4976560	That's what they do for a living.
4976560	4978400	People in L.A. are like, who's this person?
4978400	4979840	Why are they near me? Yeah.
4979840	4982120	York is just like, I live on top of people.
4984320	4986520	So I'm not going to kind of like get away from me.
4986520	4989880	Like it's like we're trying to do us and just get away and go.
4989880	4991040	It's how we kind of operate.
4991040	4993480	I think it's just like, well, yeah, it's like, it's like, it's like, OK,
4993480	4998200	I'm like I'm in a jar of people that you just and you like.
4998840	5001600	There's a dead stare that comes with that.
5001840	5004760	But if you tap the jar, they're like, how can I help you?
5008680	5010040	Because they're not dead.
5010040	5011720	They're just like, that's their job.
5011720	5013880	They're in a jar like that's the best thing they can do.
5013880	5018560	They're like focused like like in a in a space camp when they get
5019360	5021720	they accidentally launched into space, the kids.
5022080	5025240	And there's a point where it's like, oh, we only have so much oxygen.
5025360	5027520	You know, it takes up oxygen complaining.
5028320	5029040	It really does.
5029040	5033240	Like at a point like the guy who played the the gay nerd in Revenge of the Nerds,
5033240	5036360	like he was he was he was talking about French fries.
5036360	5038440	Remember that monologue?
5038440	5041120	And he's like, he's like, he's joking, eat some French fries.
5041120	5044440	And I don't know if it's the Val Kilmer like analog.
5044640	5048520	There's a guy who's like, hey, listen, I'm using up air, man.
5048840	5050280	And he's like, OK, cool.
5050280	5053360	Let's just just want to do a monologue about the guy who ate French fries.
5054320	5056680	Anyways, I'm just saying, what was I saying?
5056880	5060520	It's it's it's it's it's a jar of people.
5060920	5062120	Yeah. New York is like that.
5062120	5065160	Like like everybody, like they look you look at them and they're on the street
5065160	5068200	and you're like, oh, they they hate themselves and each other.
5068240	5069400	No, they don't.
5069400	5070960	They're just making it work.
5070960	5072160	They're fine. They got shit to do.
5072160	5074560	Every time you bump into one of them, they're like, they wake up.
5074560	5077320	It's like Westworld like they they're like.
5077960	5081680	They're like, how I'm my name is Tony.
5081680	5084560	I'm fucking I'm like, what do you need?
5084600	5086800	Like, I mean, they're not all like, what do you need?
5086800	5088600	Some of them are like, I'm going to stab you.
5088600	5092760	But but they're like, they're it's not it's not their fault.
5094480	5095840	It's not their fault.
5095840	5097280	It's a big city.
5097280	5099200	So vertically arranged.
5099200	5101440	It's not a lot of room to spread out.
5101440	5103360	Kind of get tedious.
5103880	5107600	But also you should stay here because Los Angeles is definitely going to
5108480	5109760	it's a fall under the ocean.
5109760	5110720	It's going to fall under the ocean.
5110720	5112200	Yeah. OK. Yeah.
5112200	5113280	I'm going to be moving here soon.
5113280	5114160	And like, like, like, yeah.
5114160	5119280	Can you guys have which will raise the property value in your neighborhood?
5121040	5125760	Foisting you out into a further like Jersey ish.
5127840	5131360	And you'll be like, what's up with all these fucking hormones coming?
5131560	5137240	And then there'll be like a special Harmon van that picks me up from my brownstone
5137240	5142280	and takes me up to the tower where where I do my podcast.
5143280	5147000	But the bus won't be accountable to like tickets and stuff.
5147000	5148960	And then you guys will stand in the way of it.
5148960	5151120	They're like, fuck these Harmon buses.
5154040	5156480	Have you seen have you seen those lift buses?
5157040	5158560	They're ridiculous.
5158560	5161720	They're just they're just city buses, except they have a lift on them.
5162840	5164720	I've seen them in L.A. Oh, no, I haven't.
5164720	5166520	Oh, yeah. Lift buses.
5166520	5169160	So just open sourcing public transit.
5169160	5173360	Yeah, I hear they're rolling out a program where instead of picking up people on demand,
5173360	5178400	they'll just go from place to place and people can get on and off at will.
5179600	5181640	It's a real, what do you call it?
5181640	5183920	Disruptive marketing campaign.
5183920	5191200	Yeah, you can you can get a transfer and yeah, it's amazing.
5191280	5199320	Yeah. If you earn enough points, you can slowly move from where you sit in the bus,
5199320	5202200	like toward the oh, no, that's that's complicated.
5202200	5204240	That'd be fun. Yeah.
5204240	5206880	You're like meow, meow beans.
5208680	5210720	I thought that would happen.
5210720	5216720	All right. So who right now in the Gramercy Theatre just like use your instincts
5217200	5220680	and just ask yourself, would I improve this show?
5222440	5223880	If I can. Well, let's just try that.
5223880	5225200	Let's just be open about it.
5225200	5228480	Like you, you, your, your hands are moving.
5228480	5230520	Are you? I had an interesting day.
5230520	5232120	You had an interesting day.
5232120	5233440	OK, that's good.
5233440	5235320	Let's do you want to come up and.
5235520	5245000	OK, we're we're a we're a cosmopolitan city, like we don't have to put a skin on it.
5245000	5246640	Or you're like, who likes blue?
5246640	5249960	And everyone's like, I like blue because I really just want to be up there.
5250560	5252960	This is like, who wants to be up here?
5252960	5255400	I do. I like red.
5255480	5258040	Some person said, what do you come on, knock it off.
5259840	5262720	Not everything's a wise crack.
5262720	5264480	All right. What you say your name was?
5264480	5266240	My name is Jared. Jared?
5266360	5268360	Yeah. Awesome. All right.
5268360	5270240	Hey, Jared, how's it going, man?
5270240	5272480	How's it going? Marley.
5272480	5276400	Spencer. That's that's a famous name.
5277920	5282240	Yeah, I when you say Jared, people always say, oh, Jerry.
5282240	5284160	No, oh, Jared. No, oh, Gary.
5284160	5287200	And so I always had to say like Jared, like from the subway commercials.
5287200	5288520	Right. But I can't do that anymore.
5288520	5291760	I have Jared like the prisoner.
5292760	5295920	Right. You know, like prison.
5297720	5301920	OK, Jared, well, are you young enough to ask how old you are?
5302000	5305240	I just turned twenty five a few days ago. Adorable.
5306000	5307800	Thank you. Welcome to Earth.
5309640	5311640	Good luck. Thank you.
5313200	5315000	What so? Yeah. Tell us about your day.
5315000	5320640	Well, a few like two, three days ago, I got my gallbladder taken out.
5321960	5326440	Yeah, yeah, it was my it was my second procedure in like five days
5326720	5330200	because I couldn't sleep is this horrible pain every night for like 12 hours.
5330480	5332760	And then they're like, oh, you've got a thing in your bile duct.
5332760	5334200	And I was like, that's a gross word.
5334200	5336120	And then they got the thing out of the bile duct.
5336120	5337960	And then they're like, oh, we got the thing out of the bile duct.
5337960	5339600	But then we saw their shit with your gallbladder.
5339600	5340880	So we need to get that out.
5340880	5342160	So then I got my gallbladder.
5342160	5344760	They haven't figured out when to take your gallbladder out by now.
5344760	5347000	It's very popular in women over 40.
5348800	5350160	Do you just mean the doctors?
5350160	5353800	Like, like if you go to the hospital, that's the shift.
5354000	5355720	It's like your gallbladder is going out.
5355720	5357920	Right. They love they love removing them.
5359480	5363440	Yeah, no, it tends it's normally like women like in their 40s or 50s
5363440	5364600	to get their gallbladders out.
5364600	5367920	But I was having this pain and they're like, oh, it's probably your gallbladder.
5367920	5369920	And then right, which is a really routine thing.
5369920	5372840	I mean, not it's not that it's not that it's a pretty minor surgery.
5372840	5376240	But I just curious because they said, oh, they they bothered to take this
5376240	5380160	like half step where they're like, there's something in the area of your gallbladder.
5380160	5381320	It's like, yeah, motherfucker.
5381320	5383240	Yeah, yeah. It's called the gallbladder attack.
5383240	5384840	Right. You remove the gallbladder.
5384840	5388200	Yeah, I'm I'm the offensive urban doctor. Right.
5392080	5397040	Motherfucker, you got to just give this motherfucker MRI and get over this.
5399240	5403040	I'm I'm I don't open my mouth when I talk.
5403040	5412760	I give this motherfucker a marrow transplant before I bust a fucker.
5415600	5419520	All right. Anyways, as a new character, it probably won't stick.
5420120	5423520	I don't know. Didn't seem workshopped in New York.
5423520	5426720	If anyone was going to go for it, it would have been them.
5426720	5429200	Didn't work out. Continue, Jared.
5430200	5434720	So anyway, I guess for the past few weeks, I've been dealing with this whole
5434720	5436480	like gallbladder and all the pain and stuff.
5436480	5439800	And it's it's but once I took it out, I feel like fucking great, except I ate
5439800	5443400	Zinnberger today, which was probably I probably could have made a better choice.
5443400	5448000	Well, tell us today. Well, I'm sorry, I don't want to derail you.
5448000	5453000	But like I gallbladder like I've known guys that have the gallbladder removed.
5453160	5457000	I feel like it's it seems like a thing that would happen to me.
5457120	5460640	Like I seem like a kind of person that would have a gallbladder removed.
5461000	5465400	The thing is, once it's out, you're just relying on your liver for what?
5466320	5471960	Yeah. It basically, as as I understand it,
5471960	5475000	your gallbladder like processes fat and that kind of shit.
5475240	5478440	And so normally they're like, oh, we can just take your gallbladder out
5478440	5480440	and your liver will take care of it and it'll be fine.
5480440	5483200	Oh, you know, I'm getting mixed up with the goddamn appendix.
5483240	5485120	Oh, no. Appendix. Yeah.
5485120	5487600	That's why I was doing the I was like, what the fuck?
5488200	5492480	Because the appendage, the appendix is like this thing is like this digital
5492480	5494160	and then it hurts some people.
5494160	5496760	It's hurting and you just will get that fucker out of there.
5497040	5500240	Gallbladder. OK, so you.
5501840	5505640	How many do you have before you get a gallectomy?
5505880	5508320	One, one. So it's like your liver or your heart.
5508600	5510720	Right. And that it's a one. It's a one.
5510720	5512040	It's not an open surgery.
5512040	5514800	They there's like four holes in my body right now.
5515000	5517680	And they sort of like it's here and they got I swear to God,
5517680	5521560	they like basically guide it down and pull it out of your belly button.
5521840	5525560	They pull the whole organ out, but they don't actually cut you open and go in there.
5526480	5527320	What are you showing me?
5527320	5529640	That's my that's a hole in my belly button.
5530280	5531960	OK, and then there's other holes up here.
5531960	5533040	Wow. And they're like fresh.
5533040	5534600	I want to see the whole. Yeah.
5534600	5536920	Let's let me see. Oh, OK.
5536920	5538280	I don't want to say like 50 cents.
5538280	5540640	Like they just look like the little.
5541520	5542960	They're like little bullet holes.
5542960	5545240	It was like they kept missing Jesus Christ.
5545240	5546240	They just.
5547960	5550080	What? Explain that a little bit.
5550080	5551800	I don't I don't really. Well, I was asleep.
5551920	5554320	It's a lot of stuff. Yeah.
5555160	5557280	Yeah. So dirty.
5557280	5558400	Women over 40.
5558400	5561080	How how recent does your gallbladder act to me?
5562800	5566760	OK, so you've got just little little sexy like.
5569280	5571120	But it looks like you got shot like.
5572640	5573640	Yeah.
5575800	5577000	How does it look now?
5577000	5579280	It looks less gross than this, right?
5580280	5581040	That's fine. That's good.
5581040	5582040	You're all dark.
5582040	5584000	That's as close as anybody's going to get to me.
5584000	5586360	You should bring up your gallbladder scars and show.
5587520	5589200	That's fine.
5589200	5591800	Like you you're you're a good city.
5591800	5593320	I don't want the same role.
5593320	5594080	He's coming.
5594080	5596240	I don't want to discourage behind us.
5596240	5598240	Very close, though.
5599160	5600440	OK. Oh, yeah.
5600440	5602240	Well, bring him over here for grandpa.
5602240	5604400	Well, I have that to look forward to.
5604400	5605200	Oh, yeah, that's not.
5605200	5606520	I have that to look forward to.
5606520	5607000	Bring him over here.
5607000	5609040	I guess they just give it to guys with this haircut.
5609040	5610040	You guys are.
5611440	5613120	These guys are fucking identical.
5615120	5618240	Just ethnically ambiguous guys with this haircut.
5620000	5622040	I had my I had gallbladder stones.
5622040	5623240	Did you not have this?
5623240	5624000	Yeah, I did.
5624000	5626360	But they were minor compared to the ones in the Bible.
5626760	5630000	All right, you guys, the jigs up.
5630000	5632400	You're you're a famous.
5632400	5635160	You guys are directors, I assume, like, right?
5636640	5637720	We're the duffer brothers.
5637720	5641000	Yeah, you're the something brothers for sure.
5641920	5644840	Just can you hike up your shirt, sweetie?
5645480	5646960	Oh, oh, turn around.
5646960	5648160	Give us a look at now.
5648160	5649880	OK. Oh, yeah, it's virtually invisible.
5649880	5650600	Yeah, you can.
5650600	5653280	And there was one the belly button, but that kind of didn't help.
5653280	5654680	Did you get it done in the city?
5654680	5658040	No, in L.A., actually, the city and the city.
5658040	5658720	This is the city.
5658720	5660200	No, you sound like that.
5660200	5662280	You sound like a character from Frankenstein.
5664200	5666280	Did you get from from the city up into town?
5666720	5670160	Well, if you if you live in Brooklyn or anywhere else,
5670600	5671600	Manhattan's the city.
5671600	5673600	And there's a lot of good surgeons.
5673600	5674560	Yeah, I know. I know you.
5674560	5676240	Is that a phrase in New York?
5676240	5678440	Does the city mean downtown or?
5678440	5680680	No, the city means Manhattan for the most part.
5680680	5682560	I'm from New Jersey and Los Angeles.
5682560	5684440	The city means.
5684440	5686520	In Los Angeles, the city means something went wrong.
5686840	5688880	Like I'm going to the city.
5688880	5690560	What do you why do people serve?
5690560	5692280	Did a friend of yours stay up all night?
5692280	5694680	Like, like, why are they there?
5694680	5696560	I'm from Encino, so I know you're talking about.
5696560	5698000	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
5698000	5699080	There's a Hooverville.
5699080	5701000	That's a real Hooverville.
5701000	5702400	All right. Yeah.
5702400	5703960	Well, OK, so they suck it.
5703960	5704680	What are they?
5704680	5708320	So you're saying they can remove they remove the gallbladder.
5708400	5709480	This is what I don't understand.
5709480	5711560	I can I can I can I just it's a robot.
5711760	5715000	They use a little claws to go inside and like.
5715680	5718320	Yeah, two of the two of the smaller ones.
5718640	5720400	I should have found this all out before.
5720400	5723880	They put like the tools inside and they kind of maneuver it out
5723880	5725320	and then they suck it out.
5725320	5728520	I thought it was through the bigger scar, not the belly button,
5728520	5730360	but maybe your surgeon did it differently.
5730360	5732080	But what about the duct work?
5732080	5734040	That's what I understand is when you remove something,
5734040	5737240	you have to like deal with the tubes going in and out.
5737240	5739840	You're saying like there's a robot being put in there.
5740840	5743800	I think the robot goes in the in the in the body
5743800	5746800	and the robots like in their stitching.
5748080	5751200	It's since, you know, it goes inside Christ, man.
5752080	5754600	We're going to you're going to live forever.
5754600	5756280	Problem, you kids.
5756280	5758080	Well, actually, I don't know.
5758080	5759440	Your surgery was pretty recent.
5759440	5761080	If not, he can just replace me.
5761080	5763480	Oh, no, I mean, like they say the
5764600	5768320	the doctors told me that 90 percent of people feel no difference.
5768320	5772240	But I totally experience like certain digestive kinks.
5772920	5776200	So just be aware, like if you see stuff that makes you want to puke,
5776200	5778320	you're you're kind of like, yeah, it's all right.
5779560	5782280	No, no, no, it's more actually like fatty, like fried shit.
5782480	5786000	Yeah. Also like, Dan, I know you mentioned once that like when you poop,
5786040	5788560	it's usually after you eat, it's kind of like one in one out,
5788560	5789760	like a club or something.
5789760	5792200	I I wasn't like that before.
5792200	5795320	But now after I eat, if I walk around, would you do a lot?
5795480	5797160	I've always been like that.
5797160	5798640	I've always been the same way.
5798640	5799880	It's been right now.
5799880	5803480	I'm constipated, but it's because I put like clockwork after I eat.
5803480	5804800	Like, yeah, I eat.
5804800	5809560	I believe that I'm a like a reverse pest dispenser like that.
5809560	5812440	I know I had that same thing happen.
5812440	5813640	Take a bite of a burger.
5813640	5818360	There's a poop the size of a burger that needs to come out of my butt.
5818360	5819400	That's how I experienced.
5819400	5822000	I was at work and there's this halal card across the street.
5822000	5823800	So I often go to the halal card.
5823800	5826000	One time they gave me a lot of extra shit.
5826000	5827200	So so I was eating it.
5827200	5829440	And like as I was eating it, I was like, oh, I got to go.
5829440	5832160	So I'm at work and I went and I pooped and I came back out of work
5832160	5833880	in a very small office.
5833880	5835800	I kept eating and then I had to poop again.
5835800	5838360	And then there was a third time and I was like, something's got to give.
5838920	5842960	I didn't want to be the guy who gets up and poops at least three times a day
5842960	5844120	within like an hour.
5844120	5846880	So I just told my boss I wasn't feeling well and I went home
5848240	5850480	and I took a three day weekend because I was embarrassed.
5850480	5853920	And you know what? There's no there's no hashtag for us.
5854560	5856560	Thank you.
5856560	5859440	No one cares about.
5859440	5864120	About white guys that have to poop all the time, the fecal express.
5866000	5867240	Hashtag poopy problems.
5867240	5868920	I met porn stars today.
5868920	5872200	OK, you were telling us that why your day was interesting.
5872200	5875200	And I was like, you got to go, yeah, we don't want to see your thunder.
5875200	5876680	I'm sorry. Big fan.
5876680	5878000	What was your name again?
5878000	5879640	Oh, I'm Alex. Alex.
5879640	5881160	That's my middle name.
5881160	5884520	And there's no way for you guys to touch the points of your gallbladder.
5885200	5886200	That nothing would happen.
5886200	5888040	Nothing would happen anyway.
5888040	5889480	Do you want to give it a try?
5889480	5891440	No, I mean, I mean, like if you touch them together.
5891440	5895120	Oh, well, yours are fresh.
5895120	5896400	Yeah, no, he's right.
5896400	5899920	He's he's he's it's it's not a health hazard.
5899920	5901280	And I'm glad that you pointed that out.
5901280	5903200	That's crazy. Yeah, it's a cookie butter.
5903200	5904200	They're shiny.
5904200	5906080	Like there's stuff on them.
5906080	5907800	It's not it's not a judgment.
5907800	5912920	Like they're both they're clearly they're they're family like these two.
5913520	5915080	They're not there.
5915080	5918600	There's not a lot of support out there for for younger people that have this.
5918600	5921240	It's like you go to like these chat rooms or these subreddits
5921240	5924720	and it's just all old people and makes you feel really, really small.
5926800	5929160	I didn't mean to yawn into the mic.
5929160	5934160	Sure. Hey, hey, you've got some gall.
5934160	5938680	Oh, it's a miracle.
5938680	5940760	Big chances, everybody.
5940760	5945120	We, you know, we don't got a lot of time left and we owe something.
5945480	5949520	Oh, we do. Oh, so I have I had this idea.
5950320	5954520	I know, you know, everyone's been wanting to play D&D wants us to play D&D again.
5956080	5958360	Yeah. All right.
5959840	5962760	So I was thinking maybe we could play D&D.
5962760	5964760	So first we need characters.
5964760	5967120	Do you want to reprise Sharpie or do you want to just?
5968080	5969800	I'll be Sharpie, of course.
5969800	5972680	So just we're very short on time, gentlemen.
5972680	5974960	So quickly, you got to who are your characters?
5974960	5976600	Who do you want to be? Who do you want to be in you?
5976600	5978000	Let's go. You first, Jared.

6005320	6007320	Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry. It's OK.
6007320	6009640	You didn't tell me your D&D character was a she.
6009880	6012160	I don't like brag about it, but I'm down.
6012160	6013560	You know what's up.

6049120	6051640	Yeah. No, I have to go to the field first.
6051640	6055640	I have to roll a spliff and I have to work up that appetite to get to the junk food.
6055640	6057200	So I'm going to go and smoke first.
6057200	6060800	OK, well, you're going out, you're going out to smoke and you see an old man.

6302280	6303360	I'm trying to.
6303360	6306160	Would you say do you represent the transgender community when you say
6306160	6307440	it was a great show?
6307440	6311240	I'll always. Yes, I am here completely as a I'm trying to.
6311320	6313560	I don't know how to talk about Nature Box.
6313560	6315760	OK, no, the other way around.
6315760	6316760	Because.
6320320	6321680	I get I.
6322760	6324680	What are you trying to do?
6324680	6326680	Can I? What do you need from me?
6327680	6328600	Wait, let's throw it.
6328600	6331280	Would it be accurate to say you called it trans-for-ific?
6333200	6335280	Trans-tastic.
6335280	6342480	Yeah, which is the opposite of transphobic.
6344000	6346640	Would you would you call would you call it?
6347680	6350000	Advac amazing.
6357000	6359400	More importantly, we'll put a pin in that.
6359960	6361200	How has it been going with you?
6361200	6362400	Is there any developments?
6362400	6367000	Is there anything in in either either included in your
6369240	6372520	symbolic transgender life or outside of it as a human being
6372680	6374680	in your glass blowing science?
6375400	6377040	Any what's where are you at?
6377040	6379640	We haven't heard from you in a while. Yeah.
6379640	6381960	It's been it's been quite a year, actually.
6381960	6383440	It's been a lot going on.
6383440	6384160	A lot of good stuff.
6384160	6387000	It's been quite a year for everyone.
6387000	6390080	Why is why is yours quite a year?
6391080	6393640	I've I hold his feet to the five.
6393640	6398360	She's the you guys got me.
6398360	6398840	You got me.
6398840	6399680	It's like a game show.
6399680	6403960	Culture has become a game show as a buzzer.
6403960	6406720	And then I yes, I hold holding your feet to the fire.
6406800	6410840	Well, it's been it's been a lot of of kind of spinning my wheels
6410840	6413080	and trying to figure out what's going on, really,
6413080	6415880	and getting more comfortable with the idea that
6416320	6423320	trans is always the very word trans implies a binary
6423960	6427080	as as I was taught to you going from one thing
6427080	6428520	I'm going from one thing to another.
6428520	6430080	I'm going from one side of the binary
6430080	6431640	to the other side of the binary.
6431640	6433840	And what I'm finding out is I've sort of been on this journey.
6433840	6437160	And it's like, you know, I can like stop in.
6437520	6438600	Where were we?
6438600	6439760	We were stopping at Kansas.
6439760	6440760	Yeah. Omaha.
6440760	6442160	You're the Wichita Wichita.
6442160	6443800	Yeah. I'm sort of Wichita.
6444120	6447800	There's like there's a fishing hole, but also like it's not mandatory.
6447960	6449360	Right. And it's not necessarily.
6449360	6450560	It's not necessarily why you're there.
6450560	6450760	Right.
6450760	6453320	And maybe I'm actually closer up to Calgary or something.
6453320	6455240	So I get the hotel bar.
6455760	6456960	You don't have to go on the hike.
6456960	6457960	Yes.
6461400	6462360	Is that innuendo?
6462360	6466280	I mean, you know, do we have stories here?
6467720	6471760	I always like when I go to like a hotel, I'm like, oh, you're staying in Dubai.
6471760	6472760	I've never been in Dubai.
6472760	6478200	But but it's like, oh, you're like, but really, like if the hotel is like,
6478200	6481320	oh, is there a place where I could just have a drink like in the lobby?
6481600	6483680	Like, and do you have to feel bad?
6483680	6487320	Like, because there's always like a thing in the in the foyer that says, like,
6487320	6488960	you should go to the Wonder Spot.
6488960	6492320	And while you're here, don't forget to tour Al Capone's canyon
6492520	6494160	and and all this stuff.
6494160	6496240	And you're like, kind of like this is exactly like gender.
6496240	6499520	Yes, this is I'm reading it.
6500160	6503320	Well, there's a certain amount of shame to like, like, like
6503320	6506920	as a Western culture, like it's kind of like make up your mind.
6507040	6508520	Oh, what are you doing here?
6508520	6511920	It's exactly I mean, that that is really a lot of the last year
6511920	6513760	has actually just been trying to understand,
6513760	6516040	trying to redefine what exactly gender is,
6516880	6520200	getting to a point of enough comfort that I can sort of step.
6520600	6523920	And it is comfort and it's a little bit of privilege to have that comfort.
6524280	6527800	But to be able to sort of step privilege privilege.
6528120	6530160	Well, yeah, wait.
6530160	6531960	Oh, privilege to be transgender.
6531960	6534520	Yeah, yeah.
6534520	6536280	Transgender privilege.
6536280	6538720	Or to be just a non binary gender.
6538720	6543000	They go and move new terms that new new three letter acronym.
6543000	6550720	And TLA are booing, booing, yay, or brewing, brewing, boo, boo, yay, booze.
6552560	6556840	I'm booing the binary boo boo to the binary.
6556840	6561280	Well, sure.
6563200	6564880	Do you have the fart?
6564880	6566200	I know, I'm not.
6566200	6568480	It would be a bad time to play.
6568480	6571120	Or really, once I saw you feel like your gender is like,
6572120	6575480	Oh, who ah, continue.
6576840	6578760	Where was I now?
6578760	6581080	Yeah, no, it's it's figuring out about
6581080	6587640	culture, the very idea of gender is what we've talked about this before.
6587680	6589720	It's an emergent thing.
6589720	6594200	It's something that is really exist within some sort of a matrix, some sort of a culture.
6594760	6597400	And it's manifesting something physical.
6597800	6602080	The fact that we have done that there's a there's a binary on the sexual.
6602080	6605200	There's a binary on this does that to that and out comes that.
6605200	6610600	Oh, trying to always overlay that in some sort of comfort and some sort of power
6610600	6613840	structure and let's simplify things.
6613840	6615680	Well, that does that.
6615680	6617120	So we're going to call those those people.
6617120	6618320	And they tend to do that sort of thing.
6619040	6623320	Just stepping back from all of that and saying it doesn't have to be that way.
6624040	6627560	But it's going to be a pain because it's going to be getting outside of the system.
6627560	6630000	It's going to be getting outside of the it's going to cause more energy.
6630000	6632560	You never get to be feel like the good person.
6632560	6636520	Like like like hero of the story when you're disrupting.
6636560	6642200	Like, like, yeah, there's a very few circumstances where that's when we see everybody flock to that.
6642560	6646000	When it's a matter of everybody just getting behind something and hashtagging something,
6646000	6647240	it's like, oh, it's fun.
6647240	6648160	Like, like, why not?
6648160	6650920	There's a tree there like it's standing.
6650920	6652760	Why shouldn't it be knocked over?
6653040	6656520	Like, hey, remember when I said we had very little time left?
6657720	6660520	But he said that we wasn't quite as hard of an out.
6660720	6662200	Yeah, he didn't know what I mean.
6662560	6664360	Yeah, he did say that.
6664360	6665800	Would you characterize Spencer?
6665800	6667760	What you're doing right now is transphobic.
6668000	6668600	Yes.
6670120	6674280	And it's time to transform this phobic into the end of the show.
