0	13200	For the back room of Meltdown Comics and the Nerd Melt Theater, I'm proud to say that
13200	17760	Harman Town is once again in session.
17760	24080	Please welcome to the stage, the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
24080	25080	Hooray!
26080	29080	Hooray!
29080	31080	Thank you.
31080	34080	Mr. Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.
39080	41080	Alright, thank you for waiting.
41080	46080	We usually do get it started a little bit after eight, but we had some speaker wiring issues or something.
46080	51080	The holodeck had to be rejiggered and thank you for your patience.
51080	59080	Hope it didn't affect the energy with which you were going to go home and watch Breaking Bad on your DVRs.
59080	63080	And also thank you for DVRing it and coming here.
63080	74080	Erin did not choose Breaking Bad over the show, but she is not here because she long ago committed to hosting a Breaking Bad party at my house.
74080	83080	It seems like she just stayed home to watch Breaking Bad, but it's more important than that.
83080	88080	They're guests and stuff. They're wearing costumes and having a lot of fun.
88080	98080	And we're here. Cakes shaped like hats and, you know, Aaron Paul themed snacks.
99080	101080	Anyways...
101080	106080	I was just saying backstage, I've never seen a single minute of that show.
106080	111080	And I look forward to maybe watching it all one month on DVD or something.
111080	114080	Yeah, you gotta be the last guy. I can't even think of...
114080	118080	We should find a woman that also hasn't seen it and mate you two.
118080	121080	I don't know, create some kind of...
121080	123080	Interesting couple?
123080	126080	Specialized working breed of person.
127080	132080	One thing on my mind and that's all I can think about.
132080	135080	Let's bring our friends up to make up for the last time.
135080	141080	I'm a dog owner and a cat owner. A lot of people my age have children.
141080	147080	A lot of people my age have children that are half my age.
147080	154080	I have a dog and a cat and they're not getting along.
155080	157080	They're getting along okay.
157080	161080	The cat doesn't let the dog more than a foot.
161080	164080	There's a cat bubble, you know?
164080	169080	If the dog gets too close then the cat hisses and kind of maybe swipes.
169080	172080	But they've never touched each other, ever.
172080	175080	They came very close to accidentally getting...
175080	178080	Aaron puts little Summit snacks in between the two of them.
178080	181080	There's these snacks that both dogs and cats like.
181080	183080	So those kind of cruel fashion...
184080	187080	She has a Summit and puts a little snack on the bed.
187080	190080	And the cat and the dog both like the snacks.
190080	192080	There's a Summit for the cats and for the dog.
192080	195080	Put them a little closer like Reese's Pieces.
195080	198080	A Summit like Stalin and Roosevelt?
198080	200080	Yeah.
200080	203080	So they've never touched each other.
203080	206080	The ultimate dream is to have them snuggled up to each other.
206080	208080	Like a little dog cat couple.
208080	210080	Do you think that dream is fast escaping?
211080	213080	Well, here's the plot twist.
213080	215080	So we're primates.
215080	219080	We don't understand how these creatures really think at the end of the day.
219080	221080	They exhibit characteristics that make us think,
221080	223080	well, okay, that cat's mad.
223080	225080	I get mad.
225080	228080	It doesn't want something so it's lashing out.
228080	229080	Okay, I understand that.
229080	236080	And so we then think that these things have the same brains and emotions that we have.
236080	239080	And we're just wrong and I will tell you why I found that out today.
239080	243080	I was at work and Erin texted me.
243080	248080	Well, most of my colleagues get texts from their significant others telling them,
248080	253080	oh, little Jude took his first steps while you're working on Community
253080	256080	or Franklin ate a booger.
256080	258080	You know, like they have kids is what I'm saying.
258080	266080	But I get this text, Erin said, like, uh-oh.
267080	269080	I mean, I guess I should use her.
269080	275080	I want you to feel my confusion and see.
275080	278080	For those listening, Dan has produced his enormous phone.
278080	279080	Okay.
279080	284080	So I just get a text from Erin that says, Harvey licked Fiv's butt.
288080	291080	Smile, frowny emoticon.
291080	294080	Well, it sounds like that was that was the goal, wasn't it?
295080	298080	So you said your dog touched the cat wrong.
298080	304080	Then she followed it up with dot, dot, dot, like there was candy inside her butthole.
307080	309080	And I was very confused.
309080	314080	I said, by the way, Fiv is the name of the cat and Harvey's the dog.
314080	317080	I said, what did Fiv do?
317080	318080	Question mark explanation point.
318080	321080	What did we learn we call those?
321080	322080	I forget.
323080	325080	Terror, Tara, Tara, Tara gone.
325080	327080	What did Fiv do in Tara Bang?
328080	331080	Uh, Erin, she let him.
333080	336080	Well, of course she let him.
336080	339080	Who doesn't want their asshole gently licked?
339080	341080	Then another, well.
345080	347080	I was speaking as a primate. I'm sorry.
347080	348080	Exactly.
348080	353080	Like, you wouldn't want your asshole gently licked by another primate that you hated?
354080	356080	Well.
358080	360080	Don't put words in my mouth.
360080	364080	And if you did after that primate licked your ass,
364080	369080	you would find it hard to pretend you still hated it.
369080	374080	If another primate that I hated came up to me and started gently licking my ass,
374080	376080	I would take that as an act of contrition.
376080	380080	Exactly. It would be an event that would transform a thing.
380080	382080	That's why we're a storytelling species.
382080	385080	I find ass licking always to be a transformative moment.
385080	387080	Alright, so now back to this story.
387080	389080	Oh, okay. Now I'm listening.
389080	391080	Yeah, exactly.
391080	393080	So, she let him.
393080	395080	And then followed it up with,
395080	398080	she just stood there like he was paying dues.
400080	404080	And I said, like he was paying or she was paying?
404080	407080	Are you saying she wanted it?
407080	408080	Enjoyed it?
408080	411080	And she said, he was paying.
411080	413080	She wanted it.
413080	415080	Then she sat down.
415080	419080	He sat down next to her and she hissed at him.
421080	423080	I said, I'm having trouble processing this.
423080	426080	It's not what I expected would be their first physical contact.
426080	428080	She said, believe me, I saw it and I can't process it.
428080	430080	She offered him her butt. He sniffed it.
430080	434080	He then licked her butthole for upwards of 30 seconds.
434080	436080	And I clarified.
436080	439080	And she was like, that's right. You missed a spot?
439080	442080	Then laid down. He laid next to her and she was like,
442080	444080	what are you crazy? Don't ever come near me?
444080	446080	Yep, exactly.
446080	448080	Wow.
448080	451080	Look, baby steps, you know?
451080	454080	But that's not, baby steps.
454080	456080	That's how we think.
456080	458080	You take steps and then you start to walk.
458080	461080	You develop, you adapt, you change at these milestones.
461080	464080	This cat let this dog lick its asshole.
464080	466080	It's not afraid of it.
466080	468080	Here's what I think.
468080	473080	If I had to make a guess, that Fiv, being the elder,
473080	476080	she's been there longer. She's quite old, right?
476080	477080	How old is Fiv now? Do we know?
477080	479080	She's got to be at least 13.
479080	482080	She's the grand dam of the estate.
482080	485080	And here comes this young puppy who's been bumming her out
485080	488080	and kissing at, and she's been quarantined
488080	490080	into different parts of the home.
490080	493080	And yeah, the least he can do is lick a little asshole,
493080	495080	but that doesn't make it cool.
495080	497080	It's like, no, you get to lick my ass forever.
497080	499080	I'm still not going to like you.
499080	502080	That's an alpha saying, yeah, you're the ass licker.
502080	504080	I still hate your guts.
504080	506080	Yeah, I guess.
506080	509080	The closest you can come to understanding is prison.
509080	511080	Men make love to each other in prison,
511080	513080	but they don't then high five.
513080	515080	They stab each other.
515080	517080	Thank you for letting me make love to you.
517080	520080	That's the least you can do for being in prison with me.
520080	523080	Now stabby stab stab.
523080	527080	I wonder what Harvey's instinct was.
527080	533080	He's bummed out, because Harvey views all moving things
533080	535080	as potential delays.
535080	537080	He's just assholes.
537080	540080	He sees a squirrel, he sees a cat, he sees another dog,
540080	542080	he sees a child, he sees a mailman.
542080	544080	He has the same reaction to all of it.
544080	546080	He just wants to interact and play.
546080	549080	He's a very, very, very, very jolly fella
549080	551080	who has never really experienced any pain in his life.
551080	554080	We're using this modern, you know,
554080	557080	post-Caesar Milan training technique.
557080	560080	We have never negatively addressed him.
560080	562080	We have never even implied to him
562080	564080	that he's done anything wrong.
564080	565080	And I'm proud to say it works.
565080	566080	I'm relieved to say it works.
566080	568080	Like, I always thought that dogs inherently,
568080	570080	you need to be punitive.
570080	572080	No praise, no...
572080	573080	No, no, no, praise.
573080	576080	Lots of praise for the things that you want them to do.
576080	581080	But no, if they take a shit in the middle of the Constitution
581080	585080	while you're signing it, you don't sign a Constitution, probably.
585080	589080	But if they take a shit on your Persian rug,
589080	592080	you don't, you know, the old school way is like
592080	593080	you come down, you see the shit,
593080	595080	and at the very least you go like,
595080	598080	all right, bad, and hope that they pick up on it.
598080	600080	At the worst you rub the face and blah, blah, blah.
600080	602080	It just doesn't work.
602080	604080	The dog doesn't know.
604080	605080	The dog doesn't...
605080	608080	You can make a dog negatively associate
608080	610080	negative behaviors with negative consequences,
610080	613080	but kind of, but overall what you're actually doing
613080	617080	is making the dog associate you with negative consequences.
617080	619080	You're just making the dog nervous.
619080	620080	It's kind of like,
620080	622080	the last time I did anything I wanted,
622080	625080	I got hit in the nose with a newspaper.
625080	628080	I guess I'll kind of generally stick to what I know
628080	630080	to be safe behaviors.
630080	632080	It's rabbit hunting with an elephant.
632080	634080	Well, so you've never told your dog no,
634080	636080	so your dog thinks everything is a possibility,
636080	638080	so it starts licking a cat's asshole,
638080	640080	and the cat says no after it.
640080	644080	Let's it lick her butt, and then hisses at it,
644080	645080	and he's getting negative...
645080	648080	Yeah, well, the cat isn't bound by our rules,
648080	651080	and just definitely using Caesar Milan techniques on the dog.
651080	653080	So he's all fucked up now. He doesn't know what's going on.
653080	654080	No, he's just...
654080	658080	The cat's got the dog better trained than us.
658080	660080	I don't know what you're trying to point out.
660080	661080	I'm just trying to figure out...
661080	664080	We're trying to figure out Harvey's state of mind right now.
664080	666080	It's a cat. I mean, if the dog went up to a door,
666080	668080	and the door closed on its face, it wouldn't...
668080	670080	It's the door...
670080	671080	It's a cat.
671080	673080	Do you think that Harvey has learned his lesson
673080	675080	to not lick Phib's ass anymore,
675080	677080	or do you think he's going to go back to that well?
677080	678080	That I don't know.
678080	680080	She let him lick her ass.
680080	682080	Right, for 30 seconds.
682080	684080	30 seconds is a good long time.
684080	687080	The new school of dog training suggests that over time,
687080	689080	he will become an ass-licking cat.
689080	692080	That he will only lick her ass.
692080	694080	She may have nailed it.
694080	698080	He won't go near her unless she offers her asshole,
698080	700080	and he'll just lick it,
700080	703080	but he won't ever do anything else with her.
703080	704080	I hope that's the case.
704080	705080	It'll be interesting.
705080	707080	All right, we've talked too long about this.
707080	709080	Or not long enough.
709080	712080	Let's... I just want to bring up Kumail.
712080	713080	He makes me comfortable.
713080	715080	Let's bring up Kumail Nanjiani.
719080	721080	He might be in the bathroom.
721080	723080	He's right here.
725080	727080	Hey, guys.
727080	730080	That is one of the nicest intros I've ever gotten, sincerely.
730080	732080	Yeah, I just...
732080	734080	You've become the edge of my pool.
734080	736080	I just grab it instinctively.
737080	739080	When I'm either scared or lazy.
739080	740080	We...
740080	743080	So the cat and the dog didn't like each other in the beginning,
743080	746080	and now they're better.
746080	750080	I don't have an answer to that question.
750080	752080	The dog licks the cat's asshole,
752080	754080	but the cat still doesn't like the dog.
754080	756080	The dog has always licked the cat.
756080	762080	The dog expresses all desire through barking.
763080	765080	It follows the cat.
765080	768080	The cat doesn't want to associate with the dog.
768080	771080	We have a network of baby gates with the one slat taken out,
771080	776080	so the cat has more wizardly access to the whole house.
776080	778080	It's never more than five feet away from safety,
778080	780080	whereas the dog has...
780080	782080	It's like Ladybug, that video game from the 80s.
782080	784080	There's just a lot of gates.
784080	786080	Whoo!
787080	789080	I've never heard of this video game.
789080	793080	Well, why don't you guys all marry life if you're so young?
795080	797080	I think we do.
797080	800080	We're marrying life, right, young people?
800080	802080	I don't think it's an age thing.
802080	804080	You could have referenced equally old video games,
804080	807080	but maybe a little more popular one than Ladybugs.
807080	809080	But he's like Ladybug.
809080	811080	He like...it was a very limited movement.
811080	813080	No, don't patronize me.
813080	817080	So he's like this Ladybug that you speak of.
819080	822080	You know the character's name isn't Ladybug.
822080	824080	It's Barbara.
824080	826080	We had...
827080	829080	I can't riff a name.
829080	830080	You really can't.
830080	831080	No.
831080	832080	Barbaraella.
832080	833080	Barbaraella, okay.
833080	835080	We have this cat, and she's...
835080	838080	What happened was the people who lived in our house when we moved in,
838080	840080	she had two cats, and when she moved,
840080	842080	she just left the cats outside and just moved away.
842080	844080	So which is horrifying.
844080	845080	So these two...
845080	848080	One of the cats went feral like immediately.
848080	851080	The other cat was just hanging out like really sweet,
851080	852080	like always like looking at us like,
852080	853080	hey guys, how's it going?
853080	854080	We were feeding it.
854080	857080	But our neighborhood has coyotes.
857080	861080	So every night it had to like battle giant werewolves, basically.
862080	863080	And every morning it would be like,
863080	866080	good food, do you have any guns or anything?
867080	869080	But you could see it getting more desperate.
869080	871080	So we took it to the vet, got it all checked out.
871080	873080	The sweetest cat, we named him Wallace.
873080	874080	And we...
874080	876080	Our own existing cat is bagel,
876080	878080	really sweet, unaggressive bagel, right?
878080	879080	Cute.
879080	880080	Aw, adorable.
880080	881080	And we brought...
881080	883080	Is it because when he sleeps he looks like a little bagel?
883080	886080	No, I just always wanted a cat named bagel,
886080	889080	and I was like, it's not even the right color or anything.
890080	892080	It's not Jewish or anything.
893080	895080	It is from Brooklyn though, so...
895080	896080	Not Williamsburg.
896080	897080	So anyways...
897080	901080	So, but bagels like totally switched,
901080	902080	like she turned into a different...
902080	905080	It was weird, like part of her like saber-toothed brain,
905080	907080	like evolution, it's like something changed.
907080	909080	And she like totally turned into a different...
909080	911080	Like she would walk different.
911080	913080	Super mean to this cat.
913080	917080	We would see like the bagel would just stare down Wallace.
917080	920080	So long that bagel would start falling asleep,
920080	921080	and then like wake up and be like,
921080	922080	what am I doing?
922080	924080	Oh right, fuck this guy.
925080	927080	For like a week just like staring at him.
927080	929080	And Wallace would just sort of annoyed,
929080	932080	because he's been battling werewolves, you know?
932080	933080	He's from the streets.
933080	934080	Yeah, he's from the streets.
934080	937080	It makes it clear that the Eugene Levy of cats is saying,
937080	939080	Get away, brother.
939080	940080	Exactly.
940080	942080	That's exactly right.
944080	945080	Is this better? Okay.
945080	947080	That one felt weird.
947080	949080	But Wallace is just looking at us like...
949080	950080	No, no.
950080	952080	I had that one turned down because it seemed so loud.
952080	953080	Oh.
953080	955080	And then you picked up that one.
955080	956080	All right.
956080	958080	Then I just thought to myself,
958080	962080	I think you have a more resonant voice than the rest of us.
962080	963080	You have a very...
963080	965080	I'm just loud, you're saying?
965080	968080	No, you have a very professional cedar voice.
968080	969080	You project more.
969080	970080	Okay.
970080	973080	That's a really racist stereotype, Jeff.
973080	974080	Oh yeah?
974080	976080	What do we usually scream, Jeff?
976080	977080	Oh.
980080	981080	Fuck.
982080	984080	Rise up, brothers.
984080	985080	Anybody?
985080	988080	Now nobody looks like they are on my side.
989080	990080	You do?
990080	991080	I look.
991080	992080	No.
993080	994080	I look, but I'm not.
994080	995080	He can pass.
995080	996080	He can infiltrate.
996080	998080	What nationality are you?
998080	1000080	I'm Mexican, but I still get checked at the airport.
1000080	1003080	You're Mexican, but you still get checked at the airport, yeah.
1003080	1005080	That's a bummer.
1006080	1009080	Wait, it's a bummer even if I get checked at the airport.
1009080	1010080	No, but it's a bummer.
1010080	1012080	I mean, it's a...
1012080	1014080	Look, it's a...
1019080	1021080	Yeah, but his is a double bummer.
1021080	1022080	He gets checked at the border, too.
1022080	1024080	Hey, man, bummer's a bummer.
1026080	1028080	Infinity times two is still infinity.
1028080	1029080	It's still a bummer.
1030080	1034080	Well, I guess that's sort of a crass way of putting it, but I wasn't thinking, oh, he
1034080	1039080	gets checked twice as much, but I was thinking as a white person, I was like, oh, man, you
1039080	1041080	get the harassment, which is kind of a...
1041080	1046080	I think I fantasize about being, you know, because that's the one thing that white people
1046080	1048080	don't get to have, is...
1049080	1051080	Racism? Being racist at?
1051080	1059080	Is the fantasy of being locked out, of waking up in the morning and being like, man, fucking,
1059080	1060080	fuck this shit.
1060080	1064080	So the one thing white people don't have is not having privilege?
1064080	1066080	Exactly, yes.
1066080	1067080	Yes.
1067080	1068080	You know what?
1068080	1070080	As far as sacrifices go.
1071080	1072080	Camille, Camille.
1072080	1074080	I'm aware that I'm being glib.
1074080	1075080	I'm making the same joke.
1075080	1076080	I'm just saying.
1076080	1077080	I know, I'm on one side.
1077080	1080080	You have no idea how good you have it.
1081080	1086080	Well, it's like that old joke like this, like, oh, you beat me.
1086080	1087080	You've taught me humility.
1087080	1089080	Now I have everything.
1090080	1098080	Like the idea of getting to be really hardcore Irish or really hardcore anything.
1098080	1099080	It's true.
1099080	1101080	You would want that?
1101080	1109080	What I'm saying is, if you get to be something, anything other than just this vanilla meringue,
1109080	1114080	if you get to be something, then there's the price, which is like harassment, prejudice,
1114080	1119080	and all this stuff, but then there's the upside, which is like identity.
1119080	1124080	And this poor guy, they're stopping up at the airport and going, hey, over here, Punjab.
1124080	1127080	And it's like, wait, I'm not Punjab.
1128080	1132080	I'm not even allowed to be offended in a specific way.
1132080	1134080	I'm just being inconvenienced.
1134080	1135080	What is your name?
1135080	1137080	Amadeus.
1137080	1138080	Amadeus?
1138080	1139080	Close enough.
1139080	1140080	Close enough.
1140080	1142080	Might as well be Punjab.
1144080	1147080	Amadeus is pretty racially nonspecific.
1147080	1148080	It's ambiguous.
1148080	1149080	That could be anything.
1149080	1150080	Well, I get what you're saying.
1150080	1153080	If something shitty happens to me, I'm like, oh, this guy's racist.
1153080	1156080	But to you, it's like, oh, he just hates you.
1157080	1159080	Is that what I'm saying?
1159080	1166080	What I'm saying is that when the downside is being on the barrel end of racism,
1166080	1170080	the upside is being in an exclusive club.
1170080	1172080	You get to be like something.
1172080	1173080	Yeah, I understand.
1173080	1174080	That makes sense.
1174080	1178080	So it would be a bummer to be mistaken for something and be like, whoa.
1178080	1182080	But it sounds like it's more for you like a kind of a persecution complex,
1182080	1184080	like you're kind of Christ, you know.
1185080	1191080	Yeah, that's what appeals to me about racism is the idea of being a minority.
1191080	1193080	That would be the thing that I would be into.
1193080	1198080	If I was not white, you better believe I'd make a fucking meal out of it.
1200080	1201080	Look at me.
1201080	1206080	I am a fat, white, rich guy, and I'm constantly raving about how I'm unappreciated
1206080	1208080	and I'm a genius and no one knows it and all this shit.
1208080	1210080	Would you be a Black Panther or an activist?
1210080	1215080	I imagine I would push whatever envelope you could while still being a coward.
1215080	1218080	I don't think I'd do anything cool.
1218080	1219080	I think I'd just bitch a lot.
1219080	1223080	I'd probably have a really cloying blog.
1223080	1226080	Today I was at the bank and they said, can I help you?
1226080	1229080	What do you mean can you help me?
1229080	1232080	Like I need help? I don't know.
1232080	1233080	Definitely.
1233080	1236080	It sounds like you'd be a terrorist.
1236080	1238080	It sounds like you'd have a lot of problems with a man
1238080	1241080	and you'd want to tear them down and make them feel kind of punished.
1241080	1244080	No, but he wouldn't have the courage to actually be a terrorist.
1244080	1249080	He'd just sort of have their back, whatever that means.
1249080	1252080	Some of you are trying to trick me into saying I'd be a terrorist.
1252080	1254080	Others of you are saying it takes courage to be a terrorist.
1254080	1258080	I'm stepping off of all of this.
1258080	1259080	Hey, man.
1259080	1264080	I'm just saying, you don't have to be non-white to be a terrorist.
1264080	1267080	Well, let's talk about this. Let's plan this out.
1268080	1272080	What would we do, Jeff?
1272080	1277080	First, I'd say let's hit pause on our podcast.
1277080	1279080	Let's come up with a logo.
1279080	1285080	Then I would lower the screen and I would show you a 15-minute slideshow about some ideas that I have.
1285080	1289080	I'll say I'm special guest Aziz Ansari.
1289080	1291080	We'll continue with the show.
1291080	1294080	I do. A slightly related segue.
1294080	1299080	I have been thinking lately that it's time to get back to getting to the moon.
1299080	1301080	I think we need to make that a new objective.
1301080	1304080	You mean our quickly-bailed on-premise that we had three years ago?
1304080	1306080	Yeah, but it was a passionate one.
1306080	1308080	It was about alienation, like getting the fuck out of here.
1308080	1310080	I'm getting that feeling again.
1310080	1314080	Let's get the fuck out of here, man. Everyone's dumb.
1314080	1316080	Let's go.
1316080	1319080	That's a great response. Everyone's dumb.
1320080	1324080	This guy, he's got his SAT score on a headband.
1324080	1327080	The smartest guy in the world.
1327080	1332080	Man, I've been totally waiting for someone to say that, man.
1332080	1335080	I expected a bigger response from this lot.
1335080	1337080	I thought we all felt that way.
1337080	1339080	I think most people are politely nodding, going,
1339080	1342080	Yes, don't tell them, Mayor Harmon.
1342080	1348080	Lots of monocles were falling out of people's eyes.
1348080	1352080	I want to get up there, pitch a geodesic dome with a cooler of beer,
1352080	1354080	and just be left alone.
1354080	1357080	How many people were you initially talking about bringing up there?
1357080	1359080	It should be a mythical number, right?
1359080	1363080	Either 12 or 666, I don't know.
1363080	1366080	Is pitching a geodesic dome the moon version of pitch in a tent?
1366080	1370080	Yeah, but not getting a boner.
1370080	1375080	Your bone won't be shaped like a crystal with multifaceted sides to it.
1375080	1377080	Yeah, space boner.
1378080	1379080	12 seems too small.
1379080	1381080	I think 600 is a good number.
1381080	1382080	It is.
1382080	1384080	I wonder what the ideal number would be.
1384080	1389080	The ideal number would be about 100 if the goal, excuse me for burping,
1389080	1395080	was I'm convinced that roughly 100 is sort of like,
1395080	1400080	the average person can keep track of 100 people.
1400080	1404080	It's when it starts to get past 100 that things start to get statistical.
1404080	1407080	That to me would be hell, the idea that you could keep track of everybody,
1407080	1410080	the idea that you knew everybody is living in a small town.
1410080	1412080	That would make me feel incredibly claustrophobic.
1412080	1413080	Look at these people.
1413080	1414080	There's about 100 of these people.
1414080	1415080	I don't know these motherfuckers.
1415080	1416080	Yeah, but exactly.
1416080	1418080	What if this was what we thought?
1418080	1419080	Yeah, but we don't live together.
1419080	1422080	If we all lived on a colony on the moon, we all know each other.
1422080	1423080	But it's big.
1423080	1425080	Then it would take years.
1425080	1427080	You would slowly get to know them.
1427080	1430080	You would go through rotations and go like,
1430080	1433080	hey, Ben, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
1433080	1434080	I don't know, 100 people.
1434080	1437080	No, you go to the moon and go, hey, there's a big party on Friday night,
1437080	1438080	and that would happen every Friday night,
1438080	1440080	and you'd meet everybody every week.
1440080	1441080	100 people, you get to know.
1441080	1443080	But the parties would be therefore more meaningful.
1443080	1445080	They wouldn't just default to this weird networking thing.
1445080	1447080	But you're not going to like 100 people out of that 100.
1447080	1448080	You're going to like four.
1448080	1449080	Not 100.
1449080	1450080	Yeah, at a time.
1450080	1454080	And then you get sick of those four, and you move over to four other ones.
1454080	1456080	But they're still going to be there.
1456080	1459080	You're gradually going to get sick of everybody but four people.
1459080	1462080	In 18 years, at which point there's all these new people you made.
1463080	1465080	But they're my kids.
1465080	1466080	No, they're 18.
1466080	1467080	They're other people's kids too.
1467080	1469080	But they're the kids of the people I don't like.
1469080	1470080	It's a new generation.
1470080	1472080	They rebel against their parents.
1472080	1473080	They hate their parents.
1473080	1476080	People I don't like, I don't like their kids either.
1476080	1478080	No, come on.
1478080	1481080	You would, Jeff, stop it.
1483080	1486080	We know what you're doing, and we don't like it.
1486080	1488080	I'm saying 100 people is not a lot of people.
1488080	1491080	It's just not enough for you because you're a sponge.
1491080	1494080	You would never get enough 100 people.
1494080	1497080	You'd be like, so there's a cap on the amount of love I can get?
1497080	1500080	You would be like, I'm dying in a coffin.
1500080	1502080	And I would be like, finally controlled.
1502080	1504080	It's not about receiving love.
1504080	1506080	It's about variety.
1506080	1509080	I couldn't live in a very, very small town.
1509080	1510080	Variety?
1510080	1513080	You go to the same bar every day.
1513080	1516080	I don't mean that in a bad way, but I mean like we have our pets.
1516080	1517080	No, I don't go.
1517080	1520080	Also, it's not the same people that go in every time.
1520080	1522080	It's a new cast of characters that come and go.
1522080	1523080	Is it?
1523080	1524080	Yeah.
1524080	1525080	Okay.
1525080	1526080	Is it?
1526080	1527080	Not really.
1527080	1529080	I see the same fucking people.
1529080	1531080	Every three days, some guy wanders through and goes,
1531080	1533080	hey, what's with the suit?
1533080	1535080	That wouldn't happen on the moon.
1535080	1536080	That's what you're worried about.
1536080	1539080	No, I would love, that would be good.
1539080	1543080	I love the idea that people, because now people have now stopped asking me about the suit.
1543080	1546080	Now if I show up not in the suit, people go, hey man, is everything good?
1547080	1548080	That's true, whatever you show up.
1548080	1549080	You had a funeral?
1549080	1553080	Yeah, but people are concerned like, hey man, do you just get out of jail?
1553080	1555080	What's going on here?
1555080	1559080	What do you say when people say what's with the suit?
1559080	1561080	It depends on who says it.
1561080	1565080	When I first started wearing suits a lot, you would get like,
1565080	1567080	I feel like we've talked about this in the show before,
1567080	1573080	but generally it happens at a urinal, which I'm not a big fan of urinal chit-chat.
1573080	1575080	No, I'm not here to make friends.
1575080	1576080	Yeah, exactly.
1576080	1578080	I don't want to make a connection here.
1578080	1583080	Some guy is paying next to you and he goes, hey, suit guy.
1583080	1586080	It's like, hey man.
1586080	1589080	I told dad this morning, I was at the Viper Room a long time ago,
1589080	1591080	a very long time ago, when I first, I had one suit,
1591080	1593080	one $30 vintage suit that I wore to death.
1593080	1596080	He was there with River Phoenix, that's how long ago it was.
1596080	1599080	No, it was just, it was about around the same time.
1599080	1602080	But I was in the bathroom and he goes, hey, suit guy.
1602080	1603080	I was like, hey, how's it going?
1603080	1606080	I said, do we, you know, our dicks are in hand.
1606080	1608080	And I said, I'm sorry, do we know each other?
1608080	1610080	He's like, no man, but you always wear a suit.
1610080	1614080	You always wear the same outfit, but you get some mad puss.
1614080	1618080	And I was like, I just kind of frown and he goes, hey man,
1618080	1620080	I'm not trying to hate, trying to celebrate.
1620080	1624080	By the way, and I actually said, I'm like, pine cone.
1624080	1625080	And he goes, what?
1625080	1626080	I go, I don't know.
1626080	1629080	I just thought if I say something, you'd rhyme it.
1630080	1633080	But like, you get, like, sometimes guys will go like,
1633080	1635080	hey man, how come you always wear a suit?
1635080	1636080	And I go, how come you never do?
1636080	1640080	And they go, yeah.
1640080	1642080	That's like that Donnie Darko line where they're like,
1642080	1644080	why are you wearing a stupid rabbit suit?
1644080	1646080	Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?
1646080	1647080	That's sort of like that.
1647080	1649080	Wow, Donnie Darko, what a movie.
1649080	1653080	That movie fucking stinks. Stinks. Stinks.
1653080	1655080	Some people don't like it, right?
1655080	1656080	Some people don't like it.
1656080	1658080	But more people like it.
1659080	1662080	Anatoly likes it.
1664080	1668080	Anatoly has the luxury of having English as a second language though.
1668080	1670080	That's like airbrushing everything.
1670080	1673080	It's like putting pantyhose over a shitty movie.
1673080	1678080	I'm sure like the subtleties of something's shittiness can like get...
1678080	1679080	Isn't that movie good?
1679080	1680080	I don't know.
1680080	1682080	No, I think it's like...
1682080	1683080	It's what?
1683080	1685080	It's a wonderful life, but backwards.
1685080	1687080	Yeah, it's about how he shouldn't be alive.
1687080	1688080	Yeah.
1688080	1693080	Well, but it's also backwards in the sense that it's a wonderful life is good.
1693080	1696080	So they nailed it.
1696080	1698080	They made a shitty version of a backwards premise.
1698080	1701080	It's like these movies that came out that were huge and now everybody's decided like,
1701080	1704080	we hate them like that in Garden State.
1704080	1708080	Everyone liked it when it first came out and now everyone hates those movies.
1708080	1710080	This guy hated it.
1710080	1712080	He hated it when it came out.
1713080	1714080	This guy hated it.
1714080	1715080	He hated it when it came out.
1715080	1716080	Everyone says that.
1720080	1722080	It's like in prison everyone says they're innocent.
1722080	1723080	Yeah.
1723080	1728080	I just think that like you become a curmudgeon as you get older because you basically like
1728080	1731080	you just don't bother to go through the phase.
1731080	1732080	Oh yeah.
1732080	1733080	Like when you're...
1733080	1738080	The younger you are, let's face it, I like a lot of movies from when I was like 18
1738080	1740080	that are just like they're not going to hold up.
1740080	1742080	If I show people, go like, no, this is the best movie.
1742080	1744080	It's like, watch Midnight Run.
1744080	1745080	It's the best.
1745080	1748080	Someone's going to have a right to go, Midnight Run's not that good.
1748080	1750080	Stop jacking off on it.
1750080	1756080	I was like, no, but I still agree that Midnight Run is an amazing movie,
1756080	1759080	but I still think it's equally true if somebody were to watch it and go like,
1759080	1760080	this is a piece of shit.
1760080	1765080	You were 18 when you saw this and it was meaningful to you and you can't escape those
1765080	1767080	neural pathways that you created when you saw it.
1767080	1769080	We talked about this with Goonies.
1769080	1770080	Labyrinth.
1770080	1771080	Labyrinth.
1771080	1772080	Yeah, people came up.
1772080	1774080	There was a girl that came up that felt that way about Space Jam and she's not a
1774080	1775080	bad person.
1775080	1776080	She's not a...
1776080	1779080	But she made no case for it.
1779080	1781080	Well, there's no case for it.
1781080	1782080	That's the point.
1782080	1784080	There is no way to prove that Space Jam's a good or bad movie.
1784080	1787080	Well, yes there is.
1787080	1791080	No, I meant she made no case for not being a bad person.
1791080	1793080	Oh, oh, oh, okay.
1793080	1795080	Yeah, is she here?
1795080	1796080	She's a bad person.
1796080	1798080	No, she only...
1798080	1799080	She's like Typhoid Mary.
1799080	1802080	She just wanted to suggest Space Jam was good and she's out of the next city.
1802080	1803080	Yeah.
1803080	1808080	She's in Idaho right now at an open mic.
1808080	1809080	Space Jam, right guys?
1809080	1810080	Yeah.
1810080	1811080	Give it another shot.
1811080	1816080	I don't like Led Zeppelin but I will defend Neil Diamond.
1816080	1818080	That doesn't make me right.
1818080	1819080	It makes me weird.
1819080	1820080	Right, so...
1820080	1821080	It makes you you.
1821080	1822080	Huh?
1822080	1823080	Yeah, it does.
1823080	1829080	So curmudgeonry, if that's a word, is the phenomenon of getting older and older and
1829080	1837080	older and not even bothering with the period between seeing something and realizing that
1837080	1842080	it's probably good or not good or whatever.
1842080	1845080	Not going through the part where you're like, whoa.
1845080	1847080	You just go, I'm not falling for that.
1847080	1850080	You see a Spider-Man billboard and you're just like, that's dumb.
1850080	1851080	I've seen eight Spider-Man movies.
1851080	1852080	Yeah.
1852080	1855080	And then some 18-year-old guy is like, you know what?
1855080	1857080	There's no drug like being 18.
1857080	1858640	We can't remember what it's like.
1858640	1860840	Your fucking brain is on fire.
1860840	1862720	Your dick's like a blackenedecker.
1862720	1865960	It's just like your blood is different.
1865960	1870560	Your blood is literally different and every chemical in it is different.
1870560	1876200	We take substances to alter our state but we fail to recognize that when you're 18,
1876200	1878920	you are a different species.
1878920	1883800	You see a Spider-Man billboard and you combine that hormonal energy with the fact that you
1883800	1890640	haven't been around long enough to not trust a movie and you're just like, fucking Spider-Man
1890640	1892000	4 was awesome.
1892000	1894440	And then some 40-year-old guy goes, you fucking dick.
1894440	1895440	Get out of here.
1895440	1896440	Fuck you.
1896440	1898880	You should kill yourself, you fucking piece of shit.
1898880	1900800	Whoa, what's with the fossil?
1900800	1904760	He's bummed out.
1904760	1907200	curmudgeonry is abused hope.
1907200	1908200	It's disappointment.
1908200	1912680	Yeah, you have a higher standard for the flavors you've tasted.
1912680	1915320	You go like, what happened?
1915320	1920000	But we fail to recognize that some of this shit, we're like, oh, what happened?
1920000	1923000	Why doesn't everything taste as good as Star Wars?
1923000	1925800	If you were like 12, what the fuck?
1925800	1934920	And also, there wasn't festivals and conventions where the cast of Star Wars had to show up
1934920	1940520	two years before the movie was finished and tell 6,000 people, Darth Vader's Luke's father.
1940520	1942520	Who wants to hear it?
1942520	1943520	Yay.
1943520	1944520	Okay, we got a sneak preview for you.
1944520	1945520	Here's some ash cans.
1945520	1949680	We got some bottle openers and goob goob goob.
1949680	1950680	Go to StarWars.com.
1950680	1954840	You got your free preview and all this week we got Star Wars miniseries coming in.
1954840	1957520	Everything's just kind of, you know, it's not good or bad and everything's just like
1957520	1961840	this big oatmeal of fucking like, like we were, we were, we were 12 in a world that
1961840	1963480	was like, holy shit.
1963480	1969360	There's pictures moving on the screen and there's no way to capture them except with
1969360	1970360	our hearts.
1970360	1971360	I can't.
1971360	1972360	Yeah.
1972360	1973360	They're gone.
1973360	1974360	What did he say?
1974360	1975360	He said he was his father.
1975360	1976360	I just rewinded.
1976360	1977360	I can't.
1977360	1981320	There's no word for rewinding.
1981320	1985080	My favorite toy is when I was a kid, there was two things, Legos and Star Wars action
1985080	1986080	figures.
1986080	1988640	Legos were awesome because, you know, they build stuff.
1988640	1993080	I remember being four-ish, four and a half and we're going on five, standing in line
1993080	1995680	at the Orange Cinerama Dome for Star Wars with my family.
1995680	1999680	I remember it vividly because there was a bunch of dudes in white bell bottoms because
1999680	2005640	it was 77 and they had long hair and kind of proto mustaches and everybody had pickup
2005640	2009640	trucks and vans with airbrush shit on them and there's weed everywhere.
2009640	2011080	You later on go, what's that smell?
2011080	2013200	Oh, that's the Star Wars parking lot smell.
2013200	2014640	It's a bunch of marijuana.
2014640	2016880	Why were there so many more skunks in the 70s?
2017720	2019720	By the way, it sounds a lot like right now.
2019720	2025760	My father had to take me out of the theater, out of the, embarrassingly, sadly, out of
2025760	2032440	the emergency or one of the exits by the stage left screen right door in front of everybody
2032440	2035480	because I started crying when Darth Vader came out.
2035480	2038400	That's why I love the action figures because that was the most important movie in the world.
2038400	2040840	There was a big, scary, bad guy.
2040840	2041840	That was the greatest.
2041840	2045280	So were you like training yourself with the action figure to not be scared to go through
2045280	2047360	and be able to sit through the movie again?
2047360	2048920	I am bigger than you.
2050920	2052720	You like shaming it, leaving it in the bathroom.
2052720	2053720	I never thought of it like that.
2053720	2054720	I never thought of it like that.
2054720	2059000	But that certainly has to be some of the fantasies that you are, you're Zeus, you're controlling
2059000	2061600	these things that had power over you mythologically.
2061600	2066880	I was watching the original King Kong recently and you think of like people like, when did
2066880	2067880	that come out?
2067880	2068880	I'm sure you know.
2068880	2069880	33.
2069880	2070880	33.
2070880	2074720	People just going and seeing fucking King Kong and it just like blowing their minds
2074720	2077920	and it sucks that we don't like that first movie, what was that train going through
2077920	2078920	the tunnel?
2078920	2081720	I bet people watching were like, this will never be better than this.
2081720	2083720	This is the best movie ever.
2083720	2086320	My favorite movie was People Leaving Factory.
2086320	2087320	That was good.
2087320	2088320	The Lumiere Brothers.
2088320	2089320	Yeah.
2089320	2094160	I mean, yeah, back then they actually like, like, like guys had to figure out and girls,
2094160	2100520	I'm sure, that had to figure out like that concept of like cutting from one thing to
2100520	2101520	another.
2102320	2103320	There was no language for it.
2103320	2108560	The idea of like, there was a box that captured light and there was like, oh, like those first
2108560	2116800	movies were like, go get that guy that does that magic trick because they could only conceive
2116800	2121600	of shooting something interesting that had its own interest.
2121600	2123080	Like what should we preserve?
2123080	2128560	And then someone had to figure out, wait, the camera, the audience's brain will tolerate
2128560	2135080	being, using this device to whip around the cosmos to be up in this guy's grill and then
2135080	2140880	cut to what he's looking at and then cut back to him and have him go, hmm, I want a sandwich.
2140880	2141880	Amazing.
2141880	2146680	And then when people would walk on the screen, like reportedly, supposedly, people would
2146680	2150240	see this and they would, they would like, they couldn't help but like, they would train
2150240	2151240	their necks.
2151240	2153040	And when the train came at them, people ducked.
2153040	2154040	Yeah.
2154040	2158240	It makes sense because we go to the, you know, carnival ride thing with Simpsons, Transformers,
2158240	2159240	whatever, the Capitol.
2159240	2161760	I mean, we're still going to do, anyways, what are we talking about?
2161760	2169400	So I'm wasting this show, we should be talking about terrorism.
2169400	2172600	Let's get to the moon where it's legal.
2172600	2173600	Terrorism is legal?
2173600	2174600	Yeah.
2174600	2175600	Yeah.
2175600	2176600	There's no laws there yet.
2176600	2179960	No, but nothing to blow up, but no consequences.
2179960	2183880	But then you're going against the people who you went to the moon with.
2183880	2184880	What are you rebelling against?
2184880	2185960	Aren't you all sort of in agreement?
2186400	2189000	Got to bring a couple bad people up there with us.
2189000	2190400	Just for terrorism?
2190400	2191400	Yes.
2191400	2196680	I feel like it's going to take one terrorist doing a great job for this whole thing to
2196680	2197680	die.
2197680	2203160	Now, Dan, you're saying, I don't like the idea of just a hundred people, that seems
2203160	2204160	too low.
2204160	2205160	All right.
2205160	2207480	But let's say, let's say it's a hundred because that's a good round number.
2207480	2208480	What did you say?
2208480	2209480	A hundred.
2209480	2210480	Let's just call it a hundred right now.
2210480	2211480	Well, okay.
2211480	2212480	Well, okay.
2212480	2215840	You want that guy to be like, you want to, you want enough people so that you could run
2215840	2219520	into someone at the urinal who's like, you don't hate, participate.
2219520	2220520	I don't know.
2220520	2222120	I don't want that guy in the moon.
2222120	2223960	There wouldn't be nobody allowed like that up there.
2223960	2224960	It would all be Spencer's.
2224960	2228680	It would just be like a hundred Spencer's, but a hundred Spencer's, a hundred Spencer
2228680	2230480	would devalue the Spencer currency.
2230480	2236840	I mean, I mean, I mean like Spencer, but I mean equally cool, but like everybody be different.
2236840	2238680	What have we found at Harmon town?
2238680	2239680	There are a hundred Spencer's.
2239680	2244680	My question was though, if you were up there with a bunch of really intelligent people,
2244680	2248440	would you be happy because like, isn't, isn't part of your part, your, your Christ complex
2248440	2252400	persecution thing, your fantasy that like, that how much smarter you are than people
2252400	2256240	and how much like, how much like you're always like, you know, like how much better you are
2256240	2257240	than people.
2257240	2262200	Wouldn't you kind of die on the vine if everybody was like, no, no, I don't think so.
2262200	2266280	I don't, I don't, I don't want, I don't want, I don't want, I mean, and I have discovered
2266280	2272280	as of late humble brag that I, that what like to a limited degree, as much as a, like someone
2272280	2277440	in my field is supposed to experience it, which should be never, but I have on accident,
2277440	2282120	like this concept of fame as opposed to respect.
2282120	2286120	Like I want, I want everyone to like me or I started that way.
2286120	2287280	I want everyone to like me.
2287280	2289440	I want as many people to like me as possible.
2289440	2293440	There's a, but there's, there's other people who are like, I want everyone to know my name.
2293440	2297720	I'm not one of those people do not like that because when everyone knows your name, then
2297720	2302920	it's just like random people are just going like, Hey, fuck face, like get a job, whatever.
2302920	2307840	Like I've gone out with Jack Black to grocery stores, like, like, like, like he was just
2307840	2313440	trying to buy a box of tricks and like people just like come up to him and point at his
2313440	2314440	face.
2314440	2318640	Like he's a bug and go, you're famous, right?
2318640	2322560	And he goes, no, because fuck you if you're, if you don't even know, and then like, yeah,
2322560	2325400	you are connected a picture.
2326400	2327400	Okay.
2327400	2331360	And then, and then like people running back up to him and going, cause they went and googled
2331360	2332360	him or something like that.
2332360	2339400	And they go like, Jack Black, Jack Black, King Kong wasn't that good though.
2339400	2340400	Fuck that.
2340400	2341400	That's fame.
2341400	2342400	I don't want that.
2342400	2343400	That's not no good.
2343400	2351320	Like, like, like, like, I, I want to be in a room where I don't have to worry about a
2351320	2354440	single person thinking that there's anything wrong with me.
2354440	2358240	Would you be comfortable in a room or in a, in a colony full of people that were slightly
2358240	2359240	smarter than you?
2359240	2365240	Well, you kind of felt like you, as long as, as long as I don't, first of all, not possible.
2365240	2367240	Second of all, no, no, I'm kidding.
2367240	2368240	I'm kidding.
2368240	2373760	No, I, I, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I, it's not a politically incorrect usage of the word.
2373760	2378360	Like I'm borderline retarded in terms of math, in terms of all kinds of things.
2378360	2380880	So I like, there's a lot of people that are way smarter than me.
2380880	2381880	Smart in other ways.
2381880	2382880	Yeah.
2382880	2386720	As long as, as long as the, as long as I wasn't like a burden, that's the thing that is fear
2386720	2387720	of alienation.
2387720	2389120	I don't want to be stuffed in a locker.
2389120	2393920	I don't want to be, I don't want to ever have to be in a room where there's a single person
2393920	2398280	that's like, God, it would be so much better if you just fucking die, which is high school.
2398280	2401440	It's just like, like, it's 90% of the people are just like, why don't you just fucking
2401440	2402440	die?
2402440	2403440	All right.
2403440	2407080	Then what about like, and not, not to say that people that do like, functionary jobs,
2407080	2411840	like let's say like, you know, waste removal and people that do like, people that gain
2411840	2414320	satisfaction are doing simple tasks like that.
2414320	2418440	Like they can't, we can't all be, or like the colony could not just be a bunch of intellectuals
2418440	2422640	and bunch of artists that have to be people that were satisfied doing menial tasks, like
2422640	2423640	stuff like that.
2423640	2425520	Well, I don't think, I mean, we've, we've explored this in the sixties.
2425520	2428160	Like there's, there's been like colonies of hippies.
2428160	2431680	They're all plenty smart and they, they grow their potatoes and they remove their garbage
2431680	2434200	and they cut each other's hair and they deliver each other's babies.
2434200	2437360	And it's, it's worked like there's, those people weren't dumb.
2437360	2441480	They weren't, they weren't, they weren't above or below like, like the fact that a
2441480	2443920	hundred people's worth of poop had to be cleaned up.
2443920	2447240	Like the Spanish civil war, like, like the anarchist communes there and like the Paris
2447240	2448240	communists are like that.
2448240	2452440	These are, these are people that had planned secretly under fascist governments or monarchic
2452440	2458240	governments to, they had like underground teaching each other how to run things, how
2458240	2459240	to operate stuff.
2459240	2464240	And it takes years and years and years and years of education and under those situations,
2464240	2467720	like completely illegally and underground to learn how, when the revolution happens
2467720	2469680	that we're ready to go take out the trash.
2469680	2470680	Okay.
2470680	2471680	All right.
2471680	2472680	You got this, you got this.
2472680	2473680	That's awesome.
2473680	2476120	So you'd have to be like, you can't just take a ship up to the moon and say, all right,
2476120	2478120	everybody, we're all anarcho-syndicalists.
2478120	2479960	We're all, everyone's going to do their own thing.
2479960	2482200	Uh, like, like we're all going to take pride on our work.
2482200	2483200	We're all going to do it.
2483200	2484200	Yes.
2484200	2487360	You can go, okay, everybody, cause there's only a hundred of us.
2487360	2490080	So like, there's probably 150, 200 people in this room.
2490080	2492120	So we know that we could do this on the moon.
2492120	2496200	So we go, okay, everybody, uh, we all poop and we all eat.
2496200	2501640	So, uh, there's a 100 of you, uh, and none of us, uh, wants to clean up poop.
2501640	2503840	And I mean, maybe one guy would go, I love it.
2503840	2504840	We made a mistake.
2504840	2505840	What's your name?
2505840	2506840	Toby.
2506840	2507840	Okay.
2507840	2508840	Toby fine.
2508840	2509840	Fine.
2509840	2510840	Sorry for the meeting.
2510840	2511840	Let's talk.
2511840	2515120	But assuming Toby doesn't exist, like, like, like I go, okay, no one wants to clean up poop,
2515120	2516320	but there's a hundred of us.
2516320	2517600	There's a hundred people's worth of poop.
2517600	2525200	The good news is if we all take turns, we only have to clean poop 1% of our lives.
2525200	2526200	That's a lot.
2526200	2527200	High percentage.
2527200	2532360	You also, though, you get to do all the cool stuff, like 1% of the time, like, like, there's
2532360	2533360	all kind of the poop.
2533360	2537120	If people poop, let's say once or twice or three times a day, that's, you're, you're,
2537120	2538120	you're doing it like a lot.
2538120	2540080	But this is a space colony.
2540080	2544960	Like you're pooping into a toilet that is suctioning your, we just shoot it back to
2544960	2545960	earth.
2545960	2546960	Yeah.
2546960	2548920	You know, cause then earth declares war on you.
2548920	2554760	Man, you just put like an NBC logo on it and like, like, that's a dumb joke.
2554760	2557360	It just says must see TV on it.
2557360	2564400	I was trying to think of a logo, like a corporate logo, and I blurted out the name of my employers.
2564400	2568880	That's never happened before in the, in the, in the, in the podcast where we talked about
2568880	2575720	terrorism being for brave people and the one thing tomorrow being Dan Harmon blasts the
2575720	2584520	peacock with space poop suggests that the mass opiate ain't having it.
2584520	2589440	If you, if you do hurl, uh, the colonies, the Charlie Sheen of writers blew, blew up
2589440	2591520	again last night.
2591520	2600200	This time is lava mouth flowed about poop and NBC being the same.
2600200	2609160	You could send the poop back though, because it would just burn up an earth's atmosphere
2609160	2610160	kind of harmlessly.
2610160	2611160	Wouldn't it?
2611160	2612160	Definitely.
2612160	2614080	All you have to do is make it a little slower and it'll burn up.
2614080	2615080	Yeah.
2615080	2616080	That's the great thing about the atmosphere.
2616080	2617080	Automatic poop burner.
2617080	2618080	Perfect.
2618080	2620080	We're already nailing this.
2620080	2625120	It'll be a symbolic, like now, cause because like you'd have to get that just right because
2625120	2629480	eventually you would create a pupa sphere and then a ring, a beautiful brown ring around
2629480	2630480	it.
2630480	2631480	It's like a Saturn's poop ring.
2631480	2632480	It'll look beautiful.
2632480	2633480	Yeah.
2633480	2634480	From, from the moon.
2634480	2635480	From the moon?
2635480	2636480	Yeah.
2636480	2637480	For earth it'll look like shit.
2637480	2638480	We're being satelliteed by shit.
2638480	2639480	Yeah.
2639480	2640480	And we'll go, and that's a symbol of our power.
2640480	2641480	Like we will, you know.
2641480	2644640	But then earth attacks the moon and because it's the poop wars and they come get you.
2644640	2645640	I dare them to attack.
2645640	2648760	Do you know how hard it would be for them to attack the moon?
2648760	2653680	We put, we put some fuckers on there in 1969 with a digital watch and we haven't been back
2653680	2657040	there since because we're that, it's that expensive and we're that lazy.
2657040	2658440	There's no real space program.
2658440	2661760	If we figure out a way to get back to the moon with a hundred people, all we have to
2661760	2668900	do is go to, to, to destroy the earth basically is go, Hey earth, fuck you.
2668900	2676400	And then move 20 yards so that by the time they figure out how to invade where that signal
2676400	2680720	came from, there's nothing there but a thousand craters that were already there.
2680720	2684040	Like the moon is like a mega Afghanistan.
2684040	2685040	You have moon?
2685040	2692360	I had a question, but let's talk about that a little bit.
2692360	2694320	You have, you have moon moving technology.
2694320	2695320	I think honestly.
2695320	2697160	No, not moon, I'm not moving the moon.
2697160	2699120	I'm saying a hundred of us.
2699120	2700120	Just move over.
2700120	2704360	No, but they could land a robot on the moon and we're like, I would like to see that.
2704360	2705360	We've done it.
2705360	2706360	We've done it.
2706360	2707360	Cause we're smart.
2707360	2710040	That people on the earth will still be people on the earth.
2710040	2712280	We're not smart people.
2712280	2714920	There's more than a hundred smart people on earth.
2714920	2719760	But there's sellouts and that, and that will compromise them.
2719760	2725080	If I've learned one thing, if I, if I take the hundred people I want, I will have already
2725080	2732680	removed with just removing the hundred people that I want earth, earth's passion will have
2732680	2735320	been reduced by 90%.
2735320	2744480	I want to say, first of all, I posit, I would say that mega Afghanistan is actually Pakistan.
2744480	2751920	Stop quoting your, your bumper stickers guys, they're on sale over there as you drive into
2751920	2752920	Pakistan.
2752920	2753920	Welcome to Pakistan.
2753920	2754920	Yeah.
2754920	2755920	Mega Afghanistan.
2755920	2756920	I don't know.
2756920	2761960	Maybe the tourism board needs a rewrite the entire time.
2761960	2765560	All I could see in my head was Adam Goldberg, like wearing different disguises, trying to
2765560	2768440	get on the rocket ship.
2768440	2770240	I think, I think I'd bring them.
2770240	2771240	Yeah.
2771240	2772240	I was going to say you would take Adam.
2772240	2773240	Maybe right.
2773240	2777960	I would put a statue to Adam Goldberg up in the front because it's not, there's a lot
2777960	2778960	of real estate.
2778960	2781160	So having a statue wouldn't be that big a deal.
2781160	2786680	Everybody's got a statue, so don't get too excited.
2786680	2789200	Name to me some archetypes that you wouldn't want to bring along.
2789200	2790200	Wouldn't want to bring along.
2790200	2791200	Okay.
2791200	2792200	All right.
2792200	2797080	That guy, the P guy, the rhyming, rhyming urinal talking guy is probably rhyming frat
2797080	2798080	guys.
2798080	2799080	Not coming.
2799080	2803920	Anybody who's ever said in their entire life, ever, like, and I, you'd have to somehow figure
2803920	2808120	out a way to polygraphically prove this because people are going to, their instinct's going
2808120	2810640	to be to lie when they find out what's at stake.
2810640	2815920	Anyone who has ever in their entire life said too much information.
2815920	2821480	Or first world problems or white people problems or dig a little deeper or tell us how you
2821480	2822480	really feel.
2822480	2823480	Yeah.
2823480	2824480	All right.
2824480	2825480	Yeah.
2825480	2826480	Or didn't get the best.
2826480	2827480	That's the first cut right there.
2827480	2828480	Yeah.
2828880	2831680	I just think there's one, like, I know people that use it all the time.
2831680	2834880	I just wish everybody would stop saying at the end of the day, like I hate, it drives
2834880	2835880	me fucking mad.
2835880	2836880	I say it all the time.
2836880	2837880	Yeah.
2837880	2842200	But everybody said, yeah, I think, I think I would, I probably would have to have my
2842200	2843200	own moon moon.
2843200	2844200	Yeah.
2844200	2845200	That'd be like a moon of the moon.
2845200	2846200	Yeah.
2846200	2847760	And it'd be like a little, like a little VIP moon.
2847760	2848760	Yeah.
2848760	2850760	Like we're already creating Earth.
2850760	2851760	I know.
2851760	2854000	This is why we got away.
2854000	2855000	Yeah.
2855000	2856000	But Adam Goldberg is going to be there.
2856000	2857000	Yeah.
2857040	2859720	I kind of like that, though, that we incorporate into our culture.
2859720	2860720	No offense, Adam.
2860720	2861720	I love you.
2861720	2862720	But like, it's 100.
2862720	2863720	100 off my moon.
2863720	2864720	100.
2864720	2865720	Yeah, exactly.
2865720	2866720	The moon's not big enough for the two of us, man.
2866720	2870560	I mean, but I would let you come to VIP moon once in a while.
2870560	2872880	We incorporate into our moon another moon.
2872880	2874720	Once in a blue moon.
2874720	2876800	See that's okay.
2876800	2879640	Membership provoked.
2879640	2882520	By the way, people at home don't know he stood up to say that.
2882520	2883520	He stood up.
2883720	2887040	He either took a bow or his spinal problems are.
2887040	2891680	He kind of said, I'm sorry, did that feel rude?
2891680	2894080	No, it was funny.
2894080	2895800	But it looked like he took a bow.
2895800	2898360	He chipped an imaginary top hat when he did that.
2898360	2902480	But like, yeah, it's like he had the expression on his face that he was expecting people to
2902480	2904480	just carry him out on his show.
2904480	2909680	I mean, I'm saying just for me, like the ability to be alone in a crowd is the greatest thing
2909680	2910680	in the world.
2910680	2912400	The ability to get away.
2912480	2915160	I love everybody here that comes to these shows.
2915160	2917600	I've never had a bad experience here doing Harmontown.
2917600	2919520	I've never been bummed up by anyone that's ever come.
2919520	2922600	But when the show's over, I just leave.
2922600	2924600	I want to go and kind of get away.
2924600	2929440	And that's just my own need to separate myself from crowds.
2929440	2931760	But where do you go?
2931760	2932760	You don't go to-
2932760	2935680	But I can go to, I just have to go to another place.
2935680	2938120	There'll be so many places for you to go on the moon.
2938120	2939120	Where?
2939280	2942240	The one that gives you a little tiki bar called Jeff's Place.
2942240	2943240	It doesn't-
2943240	2944240	It's a hundred people.
2944240	2945240	A hundred people?
2945240	2947400	What if I wanted a hundred different restaurant options?
2947400	2948400	There can't be just- there can't.
2948400	2949400	There'll be three restaurants.
2949400	2951400	No, there'll be more than three.
2951400	2952400	Who's gonna work there?
2952400	2953400	The moon is huge.
2953400	2955480	A hundred people are gonna man how many restaurants?
2955480	2957280	It's all automated, dude.
2957280	2958280	Okay, okay.
2958280	2961800	Okay, if there's 99 restaurants and you all work in one, then that's fine with me.
2961800	2963360	Okay, here's the thing, Jeff.
2963360	2965120	There's not gonna be any restaurants.
2965120	2966120	What?
2966120	2967120	Yeah, Jeff.
2967120	2968120	Yeah, Jeff, no restaurants.
2968120	2969120	Okay.
2969120	2971800	There's not gonna be capitalism, Jeff.
2971800	2976160	I'm not saying it's about fucking quid pro quo and reciprocity.
2976160	2979880	I'm saying there has to be- VIP Moon's gonna have some fucking swinging restaurants out
2979880	2980880	there.
2980880	2982400	If you guys wanna go have a nice meal.
2982400	2983400	VIP Moon.
2983400	2987240	Are you gonna have that restaurant that you talked about called the Leftovers or whatever,
2987240	2989800	where it's like every thing has a bite taken out of it?
2989800	2990800	Oh.
2990800	2991800	Real Ahmed's idea?
2991800	2992800	Yeah.
2992800	2993800	Is that what that was?
2993800	2994800	Well, it's gonna be called Space Bites.
2994800	2995800	Yeah.
2996000	2997880	But my moon will actually rotate.
2997880	2999640	It won't be orbit locked like our moon.
2999640	3001160	Mine will actually be like a revolving restaurant.
3001160	3004280	You can actually have a revolving view of fake bullshit moon.
3004280	3009880	Okay, where do you- a real moon?
3009880	3011400	We call it fake bullshit moon.
3011400	3012400	It's fake moon.
3012400	3014560	Because it's- Yeah, we just call it moon.
3014560	3016960	On this fictional moon that you create.
3016960	3020600	Yeah, well, we're talking about shit that we can do.
3020600	3022000	You're on a flight of fancy here.
3022000	3023320	You're trying to unite humanity.
3023320	3028440	You're clinging to the very problems that made Earth uninhabitable with your magical
3028440	3029440	VIP moon.
3029440	3033920	My moon is gonna be called Phoenixville and we're gonna look down on Moon Moon and we're
3033920	3035200	gonna go like, look, it's nice and lit.
3035200	3036200	It's just called moon.
3036200	3037200	Moon app.
3037200	3039200	We have a lot of names for the moon.
3039200	3040200	The moon.
3040200	3041200	Yeah.
3041200	3042200	The moon.
3042200	3043200	But a hundred, fuck it.
3043200	3045120	You gotta take a vacation and get off of the fucking moon.
3045120	3046120	It's so big.
3046120	3048000	Yeah, but a hundred people.
3048000	3050000	Going to the moon is the vacation.
3051000	3054080	Is the moon totally- It's like, like, like, filled-
3054080	3055080	Oh, yeah.
3055080	3056680	We have T.O. whatever the entire thing.
3056680	3057680	Yeah.
3057680	3058680	Yeah, yeah.
3058680	3059680	It's all mapped out.
3059680	3060680	What is it called?
3060680	3061680	You've got a hundred people.
3061680	3062680	We have terraformed the whole thing.
3062680	3063680	You've terraformed.
3063680	3064680	So it's not just a dusty wasteland.
3064680	3065680	No, dude, it's great.
3065680	3066680	Then where's the restaurants?
3066680	3067680	Well, I don't know.
3067680	3068680	First of all, okay.
3068680	3069680	We can't say we terraformed the whole place.
3069680	3070680	Like, there's grass there.
3070680	3071680	Is there gonna be Mexican food?
3071680	3079680	Because if there's no Mexican food, I'm going to VIP moon.
3080680	3081680	There will be Mexican food.
3081680	3082680	Here's what there's gonna be, you guys.
3082680	3083680	There has to be Mexican people.
3083680	3085680	How many Mexicans are you bringing up out of a hundred?
3085680	3087680	What in the world?
3087680	3091680	We're leaving the earth to get away from this horrible classism.
3091680	3092680	There's no words anymore.
3092680	3093680	I love Mexican people.
3093680	3094680	I love Mexican food.
3094680	3098680	Well, there will be three Mexican guys up there, and they'll all be brilliant painters.
3098680	3099680	Fine.
3099680	3101680	They're not gonna bring you food.
3101680	3102680	Okay.
3102680	3105680	Somehow that's very offensive, too.
3105680	3108680	They're gonna be great lovers.
3108680	3111680	I'm bringing Pedro Almodovar.
3111680	3114680	We're gonna need more than a hundred people, is what I'm saying.
3114680	3118680	That's a lot of shit to get done, and a hundred people aren't gonna do it.
3118680	3119680	I don't understand.
3119680	3121680	There's a lot of shit to get done.
3121680	3124680	No, we're just going up there to exist in peace.
3124680	3126680	You could do it with three people.
3126680	3131680	Yeah, but a small community, if everyone knows each other's name to me, it sounds like hell.
3131680	3132680	Oh, my God.
3132680	3133680	That's heaven to me.
3133680	3134680	Really?
3134680	3137680	Yeah, I live in a rock covered with seven billion people whose names I never know.
3137680	3142680	Yeah, but I could finally be that guy that walks into a room and goes,
3142680	3145680	Mike, Kevin, Barbara, Stacy...
3145680	3147680	We should throw some ethnic names in there.
3147680	3148680	Yeah.
3148680	3149680	Armadice.
3149680	3150680	Almodovar.
3150680	3151680	Armadice.
3151680	3152680	You're coming.
3152680	3153680	You're Mexican, right?
3153680	3154680	Armadice.
3154680	3155680	Anatoly.
3155680	3156680	He counts, right?
3156680	3157680	He counts.
3157680	3158680	Totally.
3158680	3159680	Spencer.
3159680	3160680	N.T.
3160680	3161680	N.T.
3161680	3162680	Oh, my God.
3162680	3163680	N.T.
3163680	3164680	Okay.
3164680	3165680	I guess here's the question.
3165680	3166680	You don't like to travel.
3166680	3167680	You're a hermit.
3167680	3170680	You would love to have a... build a giant Danadu wherever you ever...
3170680	3173680	I would love to not feel like a dick everywhere I go.
3173680	3174680	I go to Channel 101.
3174680	3176680	I go even out here after the show.
3176680	3177680	Jeff, what time is it?

3309080	3311200	14.
3461200	3464600	12 months to go around the Earth once, right?
3464600	3466760	Takes like 28 days or something.
3466760	3472280	But then days and nights are going to be totally different, it's not going to be 24 hours.
3472280	3474820	One day is going to be one month?
3474820	3475820	This is great.
3475820	3481120	I'll be able to read the script so much faster because already I'm not even living there
3481120	3482120	yet.
3482120	3487960	I'll get it to you tomorrow.
3487960	3496280	I might have to jerk off for a couple of air quotes, hours.
3496280	3500160	So whatever a moon year is, you have a big party.
3500160	3501160	Someone's raising their hand.
3501160	3502160	We have a hand up.
3502160	3503160	Yes, sir?
3503160	3504160	Yes.
3504160	3506160	In addition to jerking off, what would be your favorite moon activities?
3506160	3509160	I'm thinking of specifically zero gravity.
3509160	3510160	Oh, right.
3510160	3511160	Well, it's one-sixth gravity.
3511160	3512160	It's one-sixth gravity.
3512160	3513160	It's one-sixth gravity.
3513160	3517880	So he's saying, other than jerking off, what would be your favorite one-sixth gravity?
3517880	3526720	Right now, at this point, I can't see past the joy of being just left alone, largely.
3526720	3531320	I like talking to people and drinking, and I don't know if I would take a lot of advantage
3531320	3534200	of the one-sixth gravity and play a lot of football or anything.
3534200	3539280	I would think that you probably would create, indoors, it would be normal gravity, earth
3539280	3540280	gravity.
3540280	3544160	You don't want people slowly, you know, it's going to be horrible.
3544160	3550840	And given that gravity would have to be artificially induced, which means that making a fun room
3550840	3554600	would be as simple as putting less work into it.
3554600	3562240	I guess there would be places you could go where you could go, whoo, I'm only 30 pounds.
3562240	3565080	I don't know if I'd hang out there.
3565080	3568560	I think I'd just have a log cabin feel.
3568560	3572840	For you, the moon in itself, there's nothing special about the moon that is the destination.
3572840	3575000	It's just not on earth.
3575000	3577640	You just hate groups of people, and you don't want...
3577640	3583680	I don't want to be subject to, yeah, idiots' tyranny.
3583680	3586080	And then the moon is still free, free rock.
3586080	3591840	I'm afraid of my own extreme abject boredom up there with only a small amount of options.
3591840	3592840	Like I like...
3592840	3597160	But how many people do you see, like how many different places do you go to in a month?
3597160	3598160	Dozens, hundreds?
3598160	3599160	I don't know.
3599160	3600160	Hundreds?
3601160	3602520	Also, if I want to, I can take a trip.
3602520	3603520	I can go somewhere.
3603520	3604520	I'll leave.
3604520	3605520	Just the option is enough.
3605520	3606520	Yeah, certainly.
3606520	3608800	If you go to New York, it's incredibly calming.
3608800	3609800	I don't want to live in New York.
3609800	3612880	I love being in New York, because the idea that you can do anything you want at any time
3612880	3613880	of day.
3613880	3621320	I wish I would stand in a plexiglass cube if somehow you could construct a one where
3621320	3624200	it was like, oh, you're not...
3624200	3628800	You're allowed to think, say, and feel and do whatever you want while you're standing
3628800	3632480	in this space and you're not accountable to it at all.
3632480	3635120	Did you bring someone else in there with you?
3635120	3641600	No, I'm saying this is how extreme my alienation is from society.
3641600	3650920	If I could just have a three foot square patch of pee pee pad for a dog, if I stood on it,
3650920	3661160	I was not capable of being a bad person for feeling something or saying something or doing
3661160	3662160	something.
3662160	3663720	That would be such a huge...
3663720	3665680	You could just do that in a bathroom here.
3665680	3666680	Just walk the floor.
3666680	3667680	No, you cannot.
3667680	3668680	Why?
3668680	3673160	You cannot, because there is always going to be something that you can do.
3673160	3680880	Even in the privacy of your own home, you are always under the fucking rule of morons.
3680880	3684440	You are never free.
3684440	3694400	The moon is literally separate from this planet of just fucking insect people.
3694400	3696400	They will get you somehow.
3696400	3698960	And I don't care that there's no oxygen there.
3698960	3702320	That's secondary to my goddamn freedom.
3702320	3705680	I just want to stand somewhere for a little bit.
3705680	3709080	I love being asleep because they're not fucking with me there.
3709080	3712160	But in my dreams, they're still like, stop it.
3712160	3713160	Shut up.
3713160	3714160	Knock it off.
3714160	3715160	What are you doing?
3715160	3716160	Tie your shoes.
3716160	3717160	Take a bath.
3717160	3718160	I just...
3718160	3719160	But that's you.
3719160	3720160	Wait, who?
3720160	3721160	That's you talking to yourself.
3721160	3723200	No, that's them, man.
3723200	3724200	That's them.
3724200	3727840	Yeah, society's telling you to take a bath.
3727840	3728840	It sure is.
3728840	3733000	I know that this is all just like, you know, hypothetical, like in the planning stages,
3733000	3734000	but like if you...
3734000	3737760	Whatever number of people you picked, you're going to obviously have to pick them and you're
3737760	3739360	going to have the rules of who they are.
3739360	3741640	And then there's also going to have to be rules of conduct.
3741640	3745240	And my fear is that you are going to become some sort of weird autocratic tyrant.
3745240	3746720	No, no, no.
3746720	3752200	It will be true anarchy defined by the fact that there is no...
3752200	3756960	You know how like kind of in the Judeo-Christian ethic, you know, lump in all of them.
3756960	3760200	We say Judeo-Christian ethic, that's actually not probably politically correct anymore.
3760200	3765880	Like the truth is all of the new major religions, like they all have an anti-murder policy, you
3765880	3766880	know?
3766880	3769600	Like what is the worst thing that you can do?
3769600	3772520	Like inherently, what is the fiber of evil?
3772520	3775600	Like any major religion will tell you, yeah, killing another dude.
3775600	3776600	Like that's not...
3776600	3777600	Don't do that.
3777600	3778600	And then they start with the asterisks.
3778600	3785920	Well, if the government wants to, if you have to do it for me, I'd love it.
3785920	3788640	But like on the moon, of course killing, that doesn't even...
3788640	3789640	That's not even going to come into the picture.
3789640	3791240	You're never going to get there.
3791240	3798880	Like before you even get there, the big fucking taboo is going to be hierarchy.
3798880	3807080	Any implication or thirst for it will be condemned, like frowned upon.
3807080	3810200	It won't even be...
3810200	3817000	Why are you talking to me as if I'm beneath or above you at all?
3817000	3818000	Don't do it.
3818000	3822040	Don't talk to me like I'm in charge of you, and don't talk to me like you're in charge
3822040	3823040	of me.
3823040	3831520	Non-hierarchical, humanity in a bunch of grapes, like existing.
3831520	3835880	But hierarchies happen with a hundred people, there's going to be hierarchies.
3835880	3837760	We are always tempted to do it.
3837760	3840200	We're tempted to do lots of things that we have risen above.
3840200	3843200	Ideally, those hierarchies would be based on knowledge, it'd be based on seniority.
3843200	3847200	But even that, isn't that still sort of what you don't...
3847200	3849960	I have boogers in my nose that will fall out.
3849960	3856520	I have snot in my mucus membranes, I have spit in my mouth, I have turds in my butt.
3856520	3858840	We are born not knowing the alphabet.
3858840	3861800	We educate and refine ourselves.
3861800	3863480	We rise to something.
3863480	3867560	There's a memetic evolution to our species, in addition to the genetic evolution that
3867560	3873000	we've all but halted for good reasons, by going like, oh, he wears glasses, but I'm
3873000	3874000	hot for him.
3874000	3875000	Because he's smart.
3875000	3878680	Like, okay, so say hello to a myopic species.
3878680	3887000	But we chose to advance ourselves over being giraffes and going like, little bit of the
3887000	3888000	longer neck, please.
3888000	3890200	Like, fuck those guys, they're dead to us.
3890200	3892200	These giraffes are going to be dead pretty soon.
3892200	3895560	We're the only things that have a chance of getting off of this fucking piece of shit
3895560	3896560	planet.
3896560	3897560	It's not a piece of shit planet.
3897560	3898560	It's pretty nice.
3898560	3899560	It's got waterfalls.
3900560	3909040	I mean, saying that we like we achieved the ability to feel to be about to do something
3909040	3915200	naturally, raise our fist, hate, hate something.
3915200	3921840	And then we and then we and then we go, oh, no, but my species, like, even if not biologically,
3921840	3923120	I don't do that.
3923120	3926360	When I was a baby, that was like touching a hot stove.
3926360	3927360	I don't do that.
3927480	3930080	I don't I don't think about hierarchy.
3930080	3931200	I have a word for it.
3931200	3932200	I know what it is.
3932200	3933320	I recognize it when I see it.
3933320	3938120	I don't hit another person in the face with a toy fire truck.
3938120	3943680	Because when I did that the first time when I was one years old, I was I was told don't
3943680	3944680	do that.
3944680	3949120	But I don't think I think we have hierarchy now the way I mean, you called the most of
3949120	3950320	Earth insect people.
3950320	3954520	I think that's just how we do sort of because they love hierarchy.
3954520	3956000	But I don't.
3956000	3957640	That's really weird logic.
3957640	3958640	No.
3958640	3959640	Because they like hierarchy.
3959640	3963080	It's ironic logic, but it's not it's not it's not it's not flawed.
3963080	3968040	Like I look I look down on people who express hierarchy.
3968040	3970640	You look down on people who look down on people.
3970640	3971640	Exactly.
3971640	3973240	Or up to people.
3973240	3979960	I look down on everybody because we are caught in this infantile thing of thinking that we
3979960	3983080	need leaders, heroes, government.
3983080	3984600	Are you fucking kidding me?
3984600	3985600	We're not this smart yet.
3985600	3990240	How does how do we the Internet is proving to us, you know, I mean, I understand that
3990240	3993120	it has its own like like every of these governance has emerged.
3993120	3998160	But in their infancy, like like like forums like like like Reddit and like like it's the
3998160	4003480	Internet is global like like you fucking you upvote this you downvote that it's like it's
4003480	4011240	it's relatively it's not purely devoid of hierarchy, but it's functional without hierarchy.
4011240	4017200	It's like like it's like like it's not necessary for us to go, hey, there's Carl.
4017200	4018200	I love Carl.
4018200	4019200	I love Carl, too.
4019200	4020200	I love Carl.
4020200	4021200	Carl's popular today.
4021200	4023880	He doesn't have to get a better parking space.
4023880	4026280	He doesn't have to tell us what to do.
4026280	4027280	That is infantile.
4027280	4029440	It is literally infantile.
4029440	4033320	It's an instinct that we carry into adulthood from infancy.
4033320	4037520	We start to look at Barack Obama or whoever's running for anything.
4037520	4038520	We have like democracy.
4038520	4039520	We go.
4039520	4040520	We go.
4040520	4044320	Well, I mean, at the end of the day, it's got to be somebody's fault when it rains.
4044320	4045320	Like it's not going to be me.
4045320	4046800	I'm not going to take responsibility for it.
4046800	4050400	I'm not just going to hang out with my friends and like as a group, like constantly communicate
4050400	4051400	with them.
4051400	4052440	Say everything that's on my mind.
4052440	4055840	I want to go in my house and keep everything to myself and sit on a bowl of ice cream and
4055840	4059440	then get on the computer and go fuck Obama rain today.
4059440	4061560	Like it's all childish nonsense.
4061560	4064000	We are responsible for everything that happens.
4064000	4068120	Our species has inherited the planet and we know all of this in our heads, but we continue
4068120	4070680	to worship heroes and leaders.
4070680	4071720	But what do we do to them?
4071720	4072960	We crucify them.
4072960	4074120	We take people.
4074120	4078160	We put them on the covers of magazines and then we figure out why they're pieces of shit.
4078160	4083120	We do this over and over and over again in this cycle, this ritual of telling ourselves
4083120	4087360	over and over and over and nodding like rain man in the back of a truck with a straitjacket
4087360	4088360	on.
4088360	4089360	We're going, yeah, change is bad.
4089360	4090360	Change is bad.
4090360	4091360	Yeah.
4091360	4092360	Yeah.
4092360	4093360	Yeah.
4093360	4095720	I'm going to say it's a tough job.
4095720	4096720	Somebody's Adam Gilbert.
4096720	4102920	The irony of you saying, Adam, I am not above you, but don't ever clap for me because it
4102920	4103920	fucks everything up.
4103920	4108600	I like that you're saying you're not above anyone while we're all performing in front
4108600	4114360	of a three foot face of you and we're all at a place called Harman pound.
4114360	4116400	Let's bring Spencer out right now.
4116400	4117400	Spencer.
4117400	4118400	Spencer.
4118400	4119400	Spencer.
4119940	4130580	But that's a, anyone, anyone can do this.
4130580	4131960	Anyone can print a three foot.
4131960	4133480	But some people don't want to do it.
4133480	4134480	Exactly.
4134480	4135480	No, some people don't want to do it.
4135480	4136480	I don't want to do it.
4136480	4137480	I want to go to her show.
4137480	4138480	I don't.
4138480	4139480	I don't like Wednesday night.
4139480	4140800	If she has a show I want to go to her show.
4140800	4142280	What's your show?
4142280	4143440	What was the last show you went to?
4143440	4147420	You fucking and also you talk about responsibility.
4148420	4149420	Yeah, you just want to be king of the moon.
4149420	4150420	Yeah, yeah.
4150420	4151420	I don't just want to be king of the moon.
4151420	4152420	I want to live there.
4152420	4153420	No, you don't.
4153420	4154420	That's not true.
4154420	4155420	That's not true.
4155420	4156420	How often do you pick up your dog's poop?
4156420	4157420	What?
4157420	4158420	How often do you pick up Harvey's shit?
4158420	4159420	I don't know.
4159420	4160420	Like every eighth shit.
4160420	4161420	I don't know.
4161420	4162420	Well, what about the other seven?
4162420	4163420	Who picks up those?
4163420	4164420	Well, Erin works.
4164420	4165420	She doesn't pick up the other seven shits.
4165420	4166420	Yes, she does.
4166420	4167420	Does she really?
4167420	4168420	Yeah.
4168420	4169420	Where is this going?
4169420	4170420	I feel like you don't clean your own place.
4170420	4172420	You rely on other people all the time for other things.
4172420	4173420	Are you going to be Mr. Responsible on the moon?
4173420	4174420	You're going to grow your own food?
4174420	4175420	I'm not going to have a mansion on the moon.
4175420	4176420	You're not?
4176420	4177420	No.
4177420	4178420	What are you going to do?
4178420	4180420	I'm going to have a fucking Buck Rogers cubicle.
4180420	4181420	I don't know.
4181420	4183420	Like it's going to be, it's not going to be like it is here.
4183420	4184420	You're going to rely on people.
4184420	4186420	It's going to be a whole different paradigm shift.
4186420	4188420	There's not going to be property up there.
4188420	4191420	Do you think you're ready to go up there and be responsible for your own survival?
4191420	4193420	For your own daily needs?
4193420	4194420	I will have to be.
4194420	4198420	And the hundred people with me will be responsible for each other and ourselves.
4198420	4200420	And we're not going to be like, oh, my house is bigger.
4200420	4202420	The idea of a big house, think about how absurd that is.
4202420	4205420	It doesn't make any sense.
4205420	4208420	Do you know how fucking medieval that is?
4208420	4209420	Oh, my house is bigger.
4209420	4210420	Do you know where that comes from?
4210420	4212420	It's slavery.
4212420	4217420	The idea that the patch of earth that you're allowed to occupy is a little bigger.
4217420	4219420	You live in a big house right now?
4219420	4220420	Of course I do.
4220420	4222420	The earth is occupied.
4222420	4223420	It's an occupied state.
4223420	4224420	It's worth slaves.
4224420	4226420	I want the biggest house I can fucking get.
4226420	4228420	I want the most money.
4228420	4229420	I want a big bag of cocaine.
4229420	4231420	I want 11 dogs.
4231420	4233420	I want as much luxury.
4233420	4239420	But above all of that, I'd love to be on a world that didn't have to have that shit.
4239420	4240420	You don't have to have that here.
4240420	4241420	You don't have to have that.
4241420	4243420	I'm talking about you being hopeless if you didn't have that.
4243420	4245420	The kingdom of God is within you, Dan.
4245420	4247420	And then police hit you with a stick if you don't have enough.
4247420	4250420	It's illegal to be poor here.
4250420	4252420	They make your life miserable.
4252420	4256420	Freedom is a product that they sell you.
4256420	4258420	You don't have to have a house called Danadu.
4258420	4260420	You don't have to have that place.
4260420	4269420	Yes, we all want big houses because we live on a planet owned by people who have sold
4269420	4277420	us the idea that the amount of space you can walk in is an expression of freedom.
4277420	4280420	We were born out of vaginas.
4280420	4282420	We had freedom of speech.
4282420	4284420	We have the freedom of locomotion.
4284420	4287420	Nobody's talking in a vagina.
4287420	4290420	We are already allowed to do everything.
4290420	4296420	And we have been convinced that, oh, well, no, you want to park your car there.
4296420	4299420	Hey, look, man, a lot of people want to park their car there.
4299420	4300420	You're going to give me five dollars.
4300420	4302420	Not on Tuesday, you park their car there.
4302420	4303420	That's going to cost you $80.
4303420	4304420	We've got to clean the streets.
4304420	4305420	You've got to put over that thing.
4305420	4306420	What the fuck are you talking about?
4306420	4308420	What are you talking about?
4308420	4309420	It's insanity.
4309420	4313420	You're going to be such a nightmare despot.
4313420	4314420	I'm not going to have to be.
4314420	4315420	I'm going to go up there.
4315420	4318420	I'm going to have a baby for nine hours a day.
4318420	4321420	You're going to go up there thinking that you're going to be in control of the mind
4321420	4322420	of 100 people.
4322420	4323420	I'm not going to be in control.
4323420	4324420	No, I'm not.
4324420	4327420	The fact that you picked them already gives you power over everyone else.
4327420	4328420	They've got to be cool.
4328420	4335420	And the fact that you have incredibly bizarre expectations about behavior of a bunch of
4335420	4337420	different minds, a bunch of different entities.
4337420	4340420	Don't you need someone to be in charge of a situation?
4340420	4343420	Even tiny situations, you need someone to be in charge, right?
4343420	4344420	Is that Big Red?
4344420	4345420	Yeah.
4345420	4346420	Who is that?
4346420	4347420	Me.
4347420	4348420	Is that Big Red?
4348420	4349420	No.
4349420	4350420	Oh, what's your name, sir?
4350420	4351420	Ryan Drane.
4351420	4352420	Ryan.
4352420	4353420	Hello, Ryan.
4353420	4356420	I mean, I'm being devil's advocate here.
4356420	4360420	But I think that in a properly functioning society, we don't need government.
4360420	4361420	We don't need hierarchies.
4361420	4363420	We don't need power.
4363420	4367420	We don't need to enforce certain people having and holding power over the people.
4367420	4371420	People have the ability in small communities to make decisions as a group.
4371420	4375580	But have there been any sustainable communities that have lasted beyond a few years that have
4375580	4376580	had no hierarchy?
4376580	4379260	Yes, but let me just answer this question really quick, and you can answer the specific
4379260	4381780	example that I know you have.
4381780	4390060	The answer, sir, is when there's a fire, which is what you're talking about, you don't have
4390060	4395420	to have hierarchy in order to have a person who is the designated fire marshal.
4395420	4400940	You don't have to have hierarchy in order to have responsibility.
4400940	4406380	You can have 100 people get together and agree on how to get shit done efficiently
4406380	4411460	without anybody being better than anyone else and having more or less rights than anyone
4411460	4412460	else.
4412460	4415140	You can actually just organize as a group of people.
4415140	4420060	That is another fucking lie that's been told to us, is that anarchy means chaos.
4420060	4421820	Those are not synonymous words.
4421820	4424020	Anarchy means not governed.
4424020	4425020	It means non-hierarchical.
4425020	4426020	It means self-governance.
4426020	4429020	It means no rule.
4429020	4432700	As Mikhail Bakunin said, I think, he said that anarchy is the mother of order, that
4432700	4438420	the idea that capitalism and government enforced unemployment to keep price at a certain wage
4438420	4442540	at a certain place, enforced famine, war, all this stuff, that's chaos.
4442540	4444700	That's incredible disorder.
4444700	4449460	The word anarchy has been turned into something else.
4449460	4454860	I believe that people living in communities and making their own decisions, like in Barcelona
4454860	4461140	and during the Spanish Civil War and the Communes there, when the Civil Wars happened,
4461140	4464620	the governments fell apart, there was a provisional government, and everything went to shit.
4464620	4466180	Women started throwing off prostitution.
4466180	4472340	They started shrugging off machismo and started actually becoming powerful members of society.
4472340	4476700	Scholars, teachers, and universities swept up the floors and cleaned the toilets after
4476700	4479660	they were done teaching because they felt pride in their universities.
4479660	4483860	The buses ran, the sewers got cleaned, and then all of the fascists from both sides,
4484860	4489460	I'm not going to fuck the names up, but the communists and then the fascists, they all
4489460	4495940	looked at these people all living freely and starting to spread across southwestern Europe.
4495940	4499220	They all just turned their guns on them and annihilated them because the idea that people
4499220	4504400	could actually properly function if educated, if turned on by the idea that humanity actually
4504400	4506580	has an incredible desire to get along.
4506580	4510380	Kids in a sandlot absolutely share and they play and they're not bigoted and they're
4510380	4511380	not racist.
4511380	4512380	We enforce all the shit on them.
4512420	4514020	No, kids are assholes.
4514020	4515020	What are you talking about?
4515020	4517020	No, we make kids assholes.
4517020	4520300	Kids solve fucking problems beautifully if you let them, and if you don't enforce the
4520300	4527580	idea that guys are cooler than girls and get bullies and it doesn't enforce property and
4527580	4528580	shit like that.
4528580	4532780	I've seen kids beautifully behavior on each other.
4532780	4536820	If you give people respect, like Tolstoy, even though he was a landowner, he had all
4536820	4539740	these serfs and he freed them all, but he had these schools and he would let the kids
4539740	4540740	teach themselves.
4540740	4541740	What do you want to learn today?
4541740	4542740	And everybody learned it.
4542740	4544300	You could sit wherever you wanted.
4544300	4548780	They had this incredible education and these textbooks that he made were outlawed under
4548780	4552420	Stalinism and stuff because they were so cool because the idea that actually people...
4552420	4554420	Is that what they officially said?
4554420	4557820	Is that what Tolstoy said?
4557820	4560820	The anti-cooler.
4560820	4565540	You go to Lenin's tomb and there's a placard that says, no cool textbooks.
4565540	4568500	It says cool and that no smoking sound around that.
4569220	4571300	Marxism became a Pringles commercial.
4571300	4576900	I've always been an anarchist at heart, but the idea is the only bummer is that people
4576900	4581500	actually would have to have thought about it and have to be, we say, take responsibility
4581500	4584100	for your life, but that means so much more than just saying, yeah, I'll be responsible.
4584100	4587220	It's really like taking care of your children, taking care of your elderly, taking care of
4587220	4593860	yourself, not relying on everybody else to do everything for you, but also being able
4593860	4600340	to shrug off shit like sexism and misogyny and racism and these giant things that we
4600340	4605620	just taught each other to give, to necessitate power and people's control over each other.
4605620	4606620	Sounds great.
4606620	4607620	It's been done.
4607620	4609820	What happens is governments come in and assassinate you.
4609820	4611900	Not on the moon.
4611900	4612900	Because there's nothing up there.
4612900	4613900	There's no oil up there.
4613900	4614900	There's no money up there.
4614900	4615900	There's no diamonds up there.
4615900	4616900	Yeah, we have a shit ring up there.
4616900	4617900	You go very quietly.
4617900	4618900	I'm all for it.
4618900	4619900	You pitch a tent.
4619900	4620900	I'm all for it.
4620900	4621900	Now, there's no restaurants.
4621900	4622900	I'm all for it.
4622940	4625940	We're going to work on this.
4625940	4627940	The way to do that is I'll make the Mexican food.
4627940	4628940	I'll try my best.
4628940	4631060	I'll run a little Mexican restaurant.
4631060	4636460	And yes, yes, I am picking the people that are going up there because you're going to
4636460	4637460	be a king.
4637460	4641900	No, because in that town you described the fucking fascists turn the guns on them because
4641900	4644180	there's people down here.
4644180	4649100	I can't go up there with a bunch of fetuses and hatch them and be one of them too.
4649100	4652660	I have to pick cool people to end the hierarchy.
4652740	4655260	I have to pick and choose out of the seven billion people.
4655260	4656260	You have to pick and choose.
4656260	4658260	That's the flawed right there.
4658260	4659260	It's not a flaw.
4659260	4661260	It's the only way it's going to happen.
4661260	4662260	That's going to be your like slogan.
4662260	4664460	No, I'm going to wait until someone else does it.
4664460	4665460	That's how it's going to happen.
4665460	4666460	How do you pick?
4666460	4667460	How do you know?
4667460	4668460	I don't know.
4668460	4669460	I'm going to try.
4669460	4674020	And you're pointing at the insinuation that I'm going to do something as the inherent
4674020	4675740	flaw of doing it.
4675740	4678740	I'm saying how do you know what the coolest hundred people are?
4678740	4684340	See I won't n-word but I'm going to fucking like I'm going to I'm going to fucking take
4684340	4686140	a spectacular attempt.
4686140	4688420	I think you just lost a lot of black people out of a hundred.
4688420	4690620	How many black people out of a hundred are you breaking?
4690620	4691620	Eighteen percent.
4691620	4692620	Okay.
4692620	4693620	All right.
4693620	4694620	No, I don't know.
4694620	4698380	I'm going to have to come up with a methodology that's going to make sure that there's a
4698380	4700380	some kind of ethnic blind.
4700380	4701740	I love the idea that you would try to do this.
4701740	4705220	I just wonder like do you trust yourself to pick the right hundred people?
4705220	4708580	No, obviously it's going to be focused because the truth is like because then you get into
4708580	4709580	that.
4709580	4710580	Are you going to take?
4710580	4711580	Are you going to go to all seven continents?
4711580	4714980	Am I going to take like it's going to be English speaking like it's going to be American
4714980	4715980	people like I.
4715980	4719380	So it's going to be it's going to be flawed because I want to get it done.
4719380	4722780	I don't I don't I'm not I'm not going to do it perfectly.
4722780	4724360	I'm going to just do it.
4724360	4726540	I'm not going to do it perfectly.
4726540	4729700	I'm not going to I'm not going to answer to a thousand people gathering around me going
4729700	4736740	oh well if you do it this way isn't it like yeah shut it I'm doing it.
4736740	4742340	Wait you're saying there's no hierarchy by telling people to shut it this insects people
4742340	4748980	okay a planet of fucking I don't like who you've become already Dan I think I might
4748980	4752260	stay on earth for the first few years like Breaking Bad and wait until it comes out on
4752260	4753260	DVD.
4753260	4757900	But I'm telling you when you get up there it's going to be great.
4757900	4762340	Yeah no no no you're not getting a wristband to the one fancy restaurant we have.
4762340	4764340	Oh you have a fancy restaurant?
4764340	4766340	Maybe just to fuck with you.
4766340	4767340	Wristbands!
4767340	4768340	Hierarchy!
4768340	4769340	Wristbands!
4769340	4770340	Judas!
4770340	4771340	Judas!
4771340	4773340	It starts with wristbands!
4773340	4776140	Literally things around your wrist that signify.
4776140	4779980	It's going to be for one nightclub and that's going to be called fuck with Jeff.
4779980	4780980	Fine.
4780980	4784140	So that when he gets up there we're going to go hey you come into the club oh shit you
4784140	4786340	weren't here for the first two years you were waiting it out.
4786340	4790660	Can we just tattoo specific serial numbers on the people who can go?
4790660	4794180	Can we can we play a little D&D right now and can we try to enforce some of our new
4794180	4800580	anarcho-syndicalism our little coach can we try out a little like like try some of this
4800580	4807220	philosophy when we fight a spider yeah I guess hey Spencer hey guys what do you think Spencer
4807220	4811940	do you believe in me I think that you'd run into a problem of you'd have a hierarchy police
4811940	4816220	there'd be people that are like oh you're using wristbands you got to get off the moon
4816220	4819820	because but then they they're part of the same but then they're part of the yeah but
4819820	4824260	that's gonna happen because otherwise you'd have hierarchy right but so I don't know there's
4824260	4832060	got to be a way the Vulcans figured out how to the humans are fucked people are clapping
4832060	4837220	because Spencer hates humanity yeah but even it even sounds like inspiring when he says
4837220	4841940	it I mean I think it's like you know like if it's true that humans are fucked then then
4841940	4848100	what better way to spend the last decades of our fuckedness just fuck for the fuck of
4848100	4853460	it just fucking around with the idea that we're not fucked wait why not just fine we're fucked
4853460	4858220	we can be fucked by doing nothing or we can be fucked doing like trying just we could
4858220	4861540	be fucked trying I'm just playing devil's advocate here we're trying we're spitballing
4861540	4864860	we're trying to get this right you know I'm asking the tough questions now what you guys
4864860	4869500	did tonight was called spitballing I felt very persecuted and I'm really rethinking
4869500	4876140	your moon status see this is what we're up Dan I gotta tell you guys are very hierarchical
4876140	4881100	and it does not please me Dan Dan the idea that you're not gonna become a desperate up
4881100	4884340	there I think is that you need to look into that because you're almost certainly going
4884340	4892260	to be disappointed and start start making mandates and rules whatever buddy Spencer
4892260	4897320	what do you think about it all but I had a cat that I named based off of you know a promise
4897320	4903640	I made ages ago well that's a really long throwback the bagel yeah yeah why I wrote
4903640	4908000	down one time I used to carry a journal I just write down thoughts and stuff and I wrote
4908000	4914160	down cat named Jason and then my friend was like do you want a cat and I was like okay
4914160	4920480	and it was a girl but I named it Jason how long did Jason is Jason still with you Jason
4920480	4926680	still with us and Jason is great she's she's digging it okay are there are gonna be animals
4927000	4931320	on the moon I'm sorry I don't mean to go back into this no it's a that's a good question
4931320	4939760	I never would they get equal rights the dog gets a vote we're eating kibble every day
4939760	4946840	no I wish that there was a way that we could we could never leave more than a footprint
4946840	4952360	on the other species that we cross paths with but I believe that until we get our shit together
4952360	4957480	that the the most prudent philosophy is to consider humanity to be the absolute most
4957480	4960880	important thing whether or not there be dogs and cats up there I don't know that's a good
4960880	4964960	question we're not disagreeing with you we're challenging you to like you know figure out
4964960	4970680	how this is gonna go I don't know I don't like I don't like your I don't like your dominance
4970680	4974960	over animals already man I know we're gonna continue this this podcast has now become
4974960	4978640	about colonizing the moon we're gonna really do it hey where's that where's that guy where's

5059320	5063480	stood up and he took a bow I was just making the observation that spinal problems you said you'd
5063480	5067720	have a statue to him he's doing cheese reference but it came out the audience reacted as if I was
5067720	5072520	being a bully and saying his spine doesn't work right it's not that's that wasn't what I'm sorry
5072520	5078440	if it came across like that what do you think Adam could use some work but we still love your efforts
5078440	5087120	now Adam we adore you we love you thank you for coming can I can I share I I kind of like the
5087520	5094400	joke it was it was better than anything I had he came up with uh what was the skeleton one
5094400	5099120	the other day bone voyage yeah that will never be forgotten all right Spencer catch us up but we'll
5099120	5110400	do a little anarchist dnd right now hold up and last time on harmontown our heroes were in the hall
5110480	5115040	of the yarl of fornheim authentic the frozen city
5117760	5122960	the party hoped to gain some assistance in defeating admiral darkstar and ask the yarl
5122960	5129200	lived all for aid but the giant noticed right away that they had collected some of the fragments of
5129200	5136240	power and wanted them for himself this remark incensed sharpie who railed against the unjolly
5136240	5144240	blue giant unleashing a verbal teeth dicking the giant responded by stomping on sharpie leaving
5144240	5151440	him dying broken in body but not mind mulrain however had suffered a broken mind
5155040	5162320	thank you Spencer and began furiously courting the yarl's favor but chris de bur called him out
5162320	5169600	on his bullshit for which he also suffered a boot to the head but survived weighing the situation
5170240	5175120	quark alternated between rage and bargaining but sharpie continued to hurl insults at the giant
5175120	5181680	until the yarl murdered the dying man snuffing it out with his blue thumb after an insanity of
5181680	5188080	commotion and action settled the same time quark decided to trade shards for a skeleton army and
5188080	5193600	sharpie's life and limdall resurrected the slain sorcerer before sending them on their way
5195840	5196160	now
5201520	5205360	i forgot that was really intense what we did in that
5205360	5210240	throne room or whatever right guys we went we all went through a lot my favorite moment if i could
5210240	5214000	step out of the thing say was it was you you actually stood up okay guys there's a lot of
5214000	5220800	emotions going on there were there was a lot going on i don't think we'll forget no the day
5220800	5227360	within the dnd world and also in real life i know i won't so we have our skeleton army right now now
5227360	5232240	it seems a little hierarchical hierarchical right now to have a to have to have kind of soldiers
5232240	5236320	well we do the thing that Daenerys Targaryen doesn't give a throne where they're like you're
5237040	5242080	you're free but you can totally like still yeah yeah i do now i'd say to the skeletons like uh
5242080	5247520	hey you're free but blah blah blah yeah you're free but you know if you're gonna help us out
5247520	5252640	i mean we did free we did we did pick you to come to the mood so you know if you want to do me a
5252640	5262480	little favor here's some wristbands i feel like it's unfair to use the wristband that this might
5262480	5268080	i my joke i was joking the wristbands were ironic and then you guys are like wristbands
5268080	5271360	wristbands i'm like that's the joke but the moment they became convenient for your joke you put
5271360	5279520	another wristband on man wait i didn't understand that yeah hey man yeah you never will man you
5279520	5284800	never will yeah you gotta hate wristbands to get that you gotta you gotta wrist you gotta wristband
5284800	5292480	on your mind man yeah the wristband's not on your wrist man Anatoly you know what i'm talking about
5292480	5298000	you you come from mother russia like like your grandparents uh didn't have hierarchy kind of
5298080	5302240	except they had one big hierarchy over them Anatoly we're still stories books totally cool
5303920	5308640	you like them all right all right so we got our we got our army uh where do we need were you
5308640	5314480	actually going to denierism oh yeah do you want to make a speech there oh yeah yeah i know i'm not
5314480	5318400	i actually don't want to leave i don't i don't think we should do that because they're skeletons
5318400	5323200	that were conjured by a frost giant they're not people are they are they just things that not
5323200	5329440	people do they have personalities and names they are skeletons uh you know can we name them
5329440	5334720	one through 40 and that's all we that's how we like sort of give them a little bit of that is
5334720	5338160	something you could do all right we went through a lot let's just take our army and let's let's
5338160	5342800	let's let's press forward all right one through 40 we tattoo the numbers on their wrist
5345280	5349600	all right so do we not in a bad way do we need to get directions to where uh
5349600	5354400	to where admiral darkstar's fortification is or what yeah oh i mean you're still in the giant
5354400	5359760	city you're just not in that palace anymore so let's walk to the let's exit the city and go to
5359760	5366080	the admiral dark stars thing right yeah let's drop by and pay my visit yeah let's go you leave
5366080	5372240	the city heading north towards the black keep soon you come to a massive ice canyon a great rift in
5372240	5377840	the sheer cliff of ice you'll have to pass through the canyon in order to reach admiral darkstar
5378400	5383840	no bridge well no it's like uh it's like you're at the bottom of a cliff and there's like a canyon
5383840	5388960	going through it so so we should walk into the canyon or you could try and climb up it but it's
5388960	5394000	hundreds of feet and you'd need more rope probably all right well climb up it or i'm sorry yeah so
5394000	5399120	like you're at the bottom of a cliff and the only way through the cliff is this canyon that's
5399120	5404160	cutting through the cliff otherwise you'd have to go up the cliff oh i see so we're being directed
5404160	5409520	into like a like a tunnel yeah okay all right should we take a vote with us and also the 40
5409520	5419600	skeletons uh or skeletons what do you think they look on dead eyes the eyes are above the nose
5424560	5429760	well they're they're that's accurate yeah they're not going to climb anywhere with us i mean we're
5429840	5433200	not going to be crafty let's just proceed into this canyon let's do it let's go all right the
5433200	5443120	skeletons first inside the canyon you can hear howling wind but you feel cold beginning to sink
5443120	5447680	in your lack of wintry clothing is beginning to take its toll on your body is numbing your
5447680	5455840	fingers and biting your skin can we take clothes from the skeletons uh sure are they wearing clothes
5455840	5462240	they're wearing uh heavy black cloaks yeah there's skeletons they don't have dicks to be ashamed of
5467920	5471440	they don't have zipper scars on them
5474160	5478160	how do you think cloaks work by the way like what do you think the cloaks are
5478160	5484640	all right let's take some cloaks all right that happens thank you 37 thank you eight
5485440	5492560	thank you 13 you feel uh warmer but uh still it's not doing it you're gonna have to get out
5492560	5498000	at exposure within the next you know evening or so otherwise you might you might you might get too
5498000	5503200	cold in the canyon are there any like caves that we can sort of you'd have to go deeper in the canyon
5503200	5508320	to try and find something like that how much time do we have before nightfall uh you know
5508320	5512320	plenty of time i said we press on we need all right we have to find shelter you guys let's
5512320	5517200	move along immediately you hear a skittering chittering chirping sound coming from all around
5517200	5524240	you oh see we found a forest white flittering shapes swoop down from above into the canyon
5524240	5528800	thousands of these strange chittering white shapes moving about as if a cloud of gnats
5530000	5537840	hello fairies are you here to warm us that's positive thinking they are not
5538560	5544160	how do we know that they're not you just get that sense after you ask the question
5545440	5550080	are they coming straight for us they're kind of descending it's it's kind of descending into the
5550080	5555200	the canyon all around you and you kind of feel the wind whip up and you feel kind of slashes
5555840	5558880	i have an armlet of winter that's not going to help it's going to make things more cold don't
5558880	5564240	you have an armlet so we can do things with i have an armlet of spring but it's really i need to be
5564240	5569920	in a springy environment in order i can summon armor of thorny vines and i can command the vines
5569920	5577920	to blah blah blah these guys are so small though i don't know how we would i mean uh what i'm
5577920	5583920	assuming we have torches lit and stuff uh no okay well i i would like to light a torch okay
5583920	5590720	all right and hold it aloft all right you do that uh you know it's it's the winds whipping
5590720	5596240	around pretty brilliantly but you've you've managed to create like the world's best wind block to
5596240	5600880	light this torch and thank you that happens but the the howling wind at the same time it
5600880	5606320	kind of bites at your guys is uh you know heals and exposed skin you take two damage each what the
5606320	5613840	hell oh come on are the skeletons okay with them what's somebody skeletons are i mean i'm i'm using

5672160	5680160	kidding all right uh is it my turn yeah okay this is gonna sound crazy i think we should put on a show
5680960	5692000	i love shows let's do it yeah oh my god we put on a show
5696800	5702560	she's gonna be so pissed that we did a show we we put on the best show ever
5702560	5712000	well uh it's like the breaking bad of dnd show what do you do uh well i come i come down stage
5712000	5718880	and i i i i set the stage for like like it's a period piece i go it'll land without time
5720000	5727200	two peacocks fell in love one from the house of featherdom the other from the house of raven
5727200	5732720	and then the uh the camera uh cranes up and points down and it's a busby berkeley shot of
5732720	5736880	me like ester williams and i'm swimming around in the snow and all the skeletons are doing a
5736880	5746000	kaleidoscope with their boats and and the gnats the gnats are swirling around and it's a big it's
5746000	5758560	a big huge like mgm kind of musical birds of a feather never never together when you're in the
5758560	5769920	snow and you don't know where to go you need to find a cave your lives will be saved and then
5770720	5776160	uh there's a little like a little ice pool and then all of it all the skeletons are lined up
5776160	5783360	and they all start diving in like that they do the diving i rub uh i rub some snow on my face so
5783360	5788720	i have a white beard and then i and then i open a mime door and i come in and go you knock it off
5788720	5795840	you owe me the rent but i can't pay the rent you must pay the rent i'll pay the rent that's uh
5795920	5800240	that's like i made a snowman that looks like a like a hero and then the camera widens out and
5800240	5803360	i've made snowman out of every character we've met in our entire campaign
5805440	5809440	and uh and they're all there so it's like it's like a big huge production number where everybody
5809440	5813760	we've met is it yeah and i sing a song and everyone's like oh here he goes but it's a new
5813760	5821200	song it's not lady in red and it's the best fucking song you've ever heard it's amazing
5822000	5829040	it's moving and funny and inspiring and a catchy tune krista burg we had to come this far for you to
5829040	5837760	be inspired to write a new hit and all it took was putting on a show thank god we had this idea
5837760	5841200	moraine and at this point i'm all right i can't believe that you just sat there and
5841200	5846160	washington joining the show at all i'm doing nothing because like i am after last week's show
5846160	5852800	so like yeah yeah i have nothing she's not into it and all the evil gnats are crying through smiles
5853920	5861520	suffice it to say it's a great show oh we should have a final line for the show right yeah
5862160	5870320	the moral of the story the more you snow the less you know and it makes sense
5871040	5878320	yeah in the context of the show meaning don't snow so much it's too cold out here oh my god
5878320	5884240	so moving yeah you really feel not cold anymore
