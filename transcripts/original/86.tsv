0	18360	Hello, one and all. Welcome once again from Meltdown Comics in the Nerd and Melt Theatre
18360	25040	in Hollywood, California. Harmon Town is now in session. Please welcome to the stage the
25040	42240	mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon. Thank you very much. A little nervous tonight, I
42240	49480	don't know why. It's because that guy's got high standards. I could feel, I felt his
49480	53840	needs when he walked in the door, the woo guy. The woo guy sounds like he's got very
53840	59840	few needs. He's already that entertained. I'm looking at the other way around. I think
59840	64600	he's acting that way because he feels like he's at a big time. It's time for him to be
64600	68480	really entertained. Why don't you just entertain him? Why don't you knuckle down and do it?
68480	78520	I will. Speaking of our lovable fans, I stopped for a drink at the Pikey and as Aaron and
78520	88080	I were walking back, we saw this dark foreboding gang of street thugs. His kids, tufts, you
88080	95800	know? But then as they emerged into the street lights, more emo tufts. Oh, it's Harmon Town
95800	101400	fans, all of them, like five of them. But like by my perception, all different combinations,
101400	108080	like, so Anatoly was there, Matt Landsman. Those are the two faces I saw, but for my
108080	111920	social disorder caused me to just look at the sidewalk. Anatoly is wearing an Argyle
111920	117600	sweater vest. You thought he was an emo tuft? I don't know. Well, what's an emo tuft? I
117600	121200	don't know what that is. You just invented it. It doesn't matter. It was a bunch of street
121200	127200	tufts, a bunch of kids. I saw youthful posture. I saw a confident gait. Were they silhouetted
127200	130600	or could you see that he was wearing a red Argyle sweater vest? No, I did not see the
130600	136040	red Argyle sweater. So then it became clear it was like five Harmon Town fans, all walking
136040	140080	as like a throng. They were probably on their way to the pikey, I would guess, right? To
140080	147320	get 7-Eleven, okay. To get five hour energies and blinky key chains or something. It's cool
147320	153720	shit, like stuff that street kids do. But we walked past them and we were like, oh,
153720	158460	Harmon Town, Harmonians. That's what they were. We walked past them. But then something
158460	164940	occurred to me. It made me really laugh inside. Okay, so there's five guys. They're all like
164940	171820	Harmon Town fans. They probably met hanging out here. I'm just going to hazard a guess.
171820	177020	Or there's probably groups of friends who did meet by coming to the show. What if five
177020	185900	of them then robbed a bank? Or killed somebody or something? Are you worried about how this
185900	193340	would reflect on you? Worried? Delighted? I don't know. I just mean, how amazing would
193340	197100	that be? How weird would that be? Remember after Columbine where there's all this undue
197100	202540	attention on Doom, the video game? There's always this ancillary thing, whatever, something
202540	207100	happens. All friends get together in some way. They all have some common connection.
207100	214220	Oh, they would be called the Harmon Town robberies. Because they all met, there would be pictures
214220	218540	of them at the show. I think we can agree that's pretty unlikely, but I would like to plant that
218540	224940	seed right now. It would be amazing. Every group of people who ends up doing something
224940	231180	historically horrible met somewhere. I think what we should do right now is look, if the mood strikes
231180	237260	any of you, commit a non-violent but high profile crime. That's hard to do these days. And wear an
237260	243100	all wear Harmon Town hoodies. Okay, or do it with a bunch of people you've met at Harmon Town so
243100	246380	that that's the threat. Because then the cops and their statements, they're going to see this word
246380	250540	Harmon Town, they're going to circle it. They're going to release a statement and it's going to
250540	256460	be like the trench coat mafia, but it'll be like the Harmon Town killers. No, not killers. Robbers,
256460	261740	burglars. Robbers, burglars, whatever. They're going to be white collar, non-violence. They're
261740	266620	going to rob from the rich. You're worried about liability. I'm worried about being blown up by
266620	271900	one of them. I worry about my own safety if it becomes violent. Speaking of violent crime,
271900	277580	fantastic segue. Great job. We did it. That's called accidental com-trolling.
280780	287740	Twitter, you have 225,000 followers. You definitely every day someone says, someone tweets you and
287740	292860	says, my baby daughter's getting a heart transplant or whatever. Something heartbreaking and
292860	299260	you know, can you retweet and blah, blah, blah. So that I don't do it 24 hours a day. Why am
299260	303500	I qualifying this? What the fuck am I doing? I just like, like, there's all kinds of stuff
303500	308780	like that. But then those people like tweet at also Mark Marin or something like that. And it's,
308780	313740	I have, I hope your daughter has a good heart transplant and all that stuff. But I also,
313740	319100	if somebody's a big Harmon Town fan, specifically somebody that I met on tour, this, this guy's
319100	325260	brother, uh, tweeted me and it just, I promised him that I would mention it. Uh, his Twitter name,
325260	333740	the brother is, uh, um gravy, uh, um, with three S said Dan Harmon, my brother, a Harmonian you met
333740	341020	at your, uh, Portland stop was jumped beaten and stabbed and nearly died Wednesday in Seattle. Uh,
341020	347260	Thursday in, uh, ICU, we watched the new episode. We love the graceful exits for Troy Barnes and
347260	351980	Pierce Hawthorne. Would you wish Jeff a get well, uh, at Harmon Town? You're a hero to us, please.
352060	360220	Thanks. So of course, of course, Jeff, God damn it, get well. And he also said, uh, thank you, Dan.
360220	365260	When I responded to him, I said, I hope he, I hope he's, I hope he's, you know,
365260	370220	I hope he's going to get better. Uh, he said, he, I just, I don't know, surgeons broke his sternum
370220	377420	to fix his heart. So it would be a long recovery. And then he included a photo of us. Like we, we,
377500	384300	we met in Portland, not at the sternum. Yeah, there was, yeah, that's what he said. Sternum's
384300	388220	they, they broke his sternum to fix his heart. And it was a link to a picture and I clicked it very
388220	393740	hesitatingly. I'm like, well, I'm either going to, I guess I deserve this. Uh, but it was a,
393740	397980	it was the photo that we took together and the brothers. And, uh, I'm assuming from the
397980	405100	hashtag tough ginger that, uh, the kid in question, Jeff is probably the, uh, the curly redhead,
405420	410060	on the right of the picture. And boy, there's not a lot of people who look like they deserve to be
410060	416220	stabbed, but this, this, this, this kid looks the least like he deserves to be. Wow.
418060	422620	We all thought you were going either way on that one. I would have stabbed this cocksucker.
424140	428460	It's like, you're looking for something like, like, like, like, oh, I can see why he got stabbed.
428460	433740	Look at that hat. Uh, this kid looks like he's just adorable. He looks like a little angel. So
433820	439500	Jeff, uh, if you're able to be listening to this, uh, uh, our prayers and good vibes are with you,
439500	444060	uh, here at Harman town and we're, we're, tell your doctors to stop breaking your sternum.
444060	449020	No, they had to. They had to fix his heart. Can you imagine Jesus Christ? Wow.
449020	452460	Hearts all fucked up. They're going to break your sternum. Maybe they broke his sternum and
452460	458860	they said that after the fact. Yeah. You're like mechanics. You're going to make a heart omelet.
458860	462940	You gotta, you gotta break a couple. Yeah. I don't know, man. Your sternum is all in the way of your
462940	471260	heart. That's you should have brought it in more often. It makes sense because mechanics get away
471260	477740	with almost literal murder because you, none of us know anything about cars. Way less of us know
477740	482780	anything about the human body. So how do you trust these fucking doctors? Fuck them. I'm sorry, Jeff,
482780	487500	you should trust your doctors in intensive care. You should, you should trust that they know what
487500	494700	they're doing. All right. So, uh, I don't know. There's a couple of things I wanted to talk about,
494700	498780	but, uh, I think we should bring up our guests first. Let's do it. Because maybe we can talk
498780	504620	about it with some of them if we're lacking for conversation. Uh, uh, so, uh, Allie Ward and Georgia
504620	510780	Harstark, Hartstark. Uh, they're, they're known as Allie and Georgia commonly. And I asked them in
510780	515660	the last names in the green room. Uh, they're on the feral audio network. Would you figure that,
515660	520540	Jeff? Did you know that feral audio is a network? I have, I'd be jiggered if I knew that.
521420	525740	Their podcast is called slumber party. Uh, and they did have a show on the cooking channel called
525740	531340	tripping out and they're known for making insane cocktails like the McNugget teeny. What? You can
531340	536700	ask them about it if you want. I'm fucking going to. Sometimes I just read the, uh, blurb that I get
536700	541100	to, but, but, uh, but here's why they're really coming out. Cause they're going to start doing
541100	545580	their podcast live. Uh, and their first live podcast is at the Hollywood improv Wednesday,
545580	552300	the 29th. And, uh, and their first guest is Dan Harmon. That sounds exciting to me. Is he in town?
552300	556940	Yeah. Uh, so let's bring them up. Allie and Georgia, come on out.
556940	574220	Sit where you like, do what you like. Sorry. I called one of you hearstark
577100	579980	nervous tonight. I don't know why it's cause of the woo guy. I don't know.
580780	584380	You said you were nervous before the guy would then I just compounded it.
584380	587900	I think it may be because we hadn't, we didn't do shows in so long. We went to Scotland and we
587900	593260	came back. Last week's show, I was in a blackout drunk. I won't listen to it. We talked about
593260	599580	gender for three hours. I'd like to say a quick apology to all listeners that still listen to us
599580	609020	after that show. Cause that show was Ali and Georgia three unqualified lunatics talking about
609020	614380	an issue. They neither know anything about or have any fucking instinct and fucking wow.
614380	618780	Nor an issue. I was gonna say you have double vaginas up here. If you need to revisit any
618780	624860	gender stuff combined, it's like maybe one and a half or three. But you guys said you enjoyed it
624860	629580	and you have, yeah, I did enjoy it. I enjoy you guys. I enjoyed those without vaginas talking
629580	633980	about the people with vaginas. I don't think, I don't think the lack of vagina was what disqualified
634060	641660	us. It was a lack of intellectual assertion. Like we were just, it was rudderless, meaningless
641660	645740	garbage. Yeah. I just kind of blunder into that room and just go like, can you believe
645740	651980	black men had the vote before white women? That's crazy. Good night. And then I go home and sleep
651980	658700	like a baby. And then all races and all genders are like, what the fuck? What? What are you,
659260	662700	what did you mean? We're, we're making this up and we misspeak a lot. You know,
662700	665980	like, you know, like we, you say the wrong thing. You misquote something that's going to
665980	669740	happen. That's fine. You know, like it's going to happen to anybody. That doesn't bother me. I,
669740	674060	I didn't, I mean, I, I never listened to our shows. I would never listen to that one again,
674060	678940	similarly from my own sense of wellbeing. I listened to almost all of them. Then there's
678940	682860	some that I, it has mostly to do with alcohol intake. Like I feel like if I get off stage and
682860	686540	I'm like, I don't even remember how that show went, but I don't listen to it. You can, you can have
686540	692060	drunk vodka all day long and come up here and have like incredible facility. Like you can be quite
692060	698700	lucid, even though I know, because I know you, that you're steamboat Willie drunk. But, but that
698700	705420	night seemed to be extra special, like swirly and like, like, I think I had been drinking for two
705420	709660	days or something. I don't know. Let's talk to the ladies. Anything different? Yeah. Well,
709660	714060	had you read like an, I had you seen like a blurb about feminism or something like what precipitated
714060	718220	it? Well, no, some guy sent us a book. I remember that. I remember that. Yeah. I remember that it
718380	724540	was a giant shit on him. Mine was simply on format. I didn't even read his stuff. I'm sure
724540	728860	he's great, but his publisher can go second. I don't know. No, I have no idea how we got on
728860	733420	the topic. I mean, you listened to it. I did. Yeah. I mean, I just, I learned not to, not to send
733420	737820	you a book until, which is fine. I hadn't played on it anyway. So we're good. We're in the clear.
737820	742220	And then, uh, and yeah, I learned that, um, while I would revisit the thought that, um,
742220	746460	that machines replace slavery, which is always, and then of course there's us with all of our
746460	749740	dumb iPhones that are made essentially by slaves. And that's a whole nother story, but whatever.
750620	756460	God, I touched on that slavery. Can I just open up, uh, with chicken McNugget teeny?
758620	764300	Tell me a little bit about this. Okay. Well, that's how we monetized our friendship. Yeah.
766060	769580	We like have this inside joke between the two of us. We were best friends and we'd go out at
769580	775020	late at night and drink and we had the hard jobs and yeah, we had, I was actually a writer at the
775020	779420	LA times. And so I would be there until the lights turned off and I'd have to call the power
779420	783980	room and be like, can you turn them back on? And I was a receptionist. So I had to say yes to white
783980	789180	men. Yeah. Like rich white men. I had to be like smile and that's really hard. You guys, she would,
789180	793900	she would G chat me and she'd be like, Oh, they asked me to fax something. I'm right in the middle
793900	800140	of like the fourth episode of whatever. She hated it. And so, um, we had, we always had this joke
800140	804300	where we wanted to go out for a McNugget teeny after work because it would take care of dinner
804300	808300	and a drink and dessert. And then we could just get it out of the way and then suffer again in the
808300	813260	morning. And so we had this joke and I think we posted on each other's MySpace pages at the time.
813260	816140	And I'm like, nugget teeny. Right. And then we're like, what if we actually did this? Like,
816140	819180	what would it taste like? And it just like, was this like long standing joke between the two of
819180	822940	us. And finally be like, well, let's do it. It was like a Pegasus that you're like, does it exist?
822940	827900	Let's make it. So how do you make it? Well, so then we had our friend Peter Tonsio, who's the
827900	833580	really funny comedy director, but he then didn't. Yeah. He was making things for like super deluxe
833580	837260	and they paid him in like packets of oatmeal and he had still worked for them. But, um, now he,
837260	841580	now he directs Key and Peel. So we managed to get in on the ground floor there, but, um, he made a,
841580	845900	he made a video for us of us making this drink and it involves, which is like all manner of
845900	851740	horrible, just in every scale. It's a McDonald's milkshake, milkshake, chocolate, chocolate. And
851740	856140	then you add vanilla vodka to it and you shake it lightly. And then you pour it into a martini glass.
856140	861820	That's been rimmed in McDonald's barbecue sauce. And then no actual McNugget, like, no, no,
862380	867340	no, not done yet. Oh, you put one on the rim, like a. It's perched on the side as a garnish
867340	872700	is a McNugget. So wait, chocolate milkshake, vanilla vodka. Are you taking notes? No, I'm just,
872700	881660	I'm, I'm just barfing with a rim of barbecue sauce and a, and I'm imagining like you would
881660	887580	put an olive garnish or an onion and a Gibson. Yeah. A chicken McNugget resting gently across the,
887660	892780	on the rim. So you like slice it down the side a little bit. Yeah. Like a, like a lemon. Yeah. So
892780	896540	then you drink it and it's, you have to get through the barbecue sauce and then when you're
896540	901180	done with it, you swipe the McNugget around the rim and eat it. Yeah. And it's like, you know,
901180	908060	when you dip French fries and like a milkshake, I've heard of worse foods than that. And there's
908060	913980	a hilarious, like Greg, please, if you have not done this, go read, there's a New York times,
914060	919340	a restaurant review of Guy Fieri's Times Square. Amazing. Times Square. Have you heard, have you
919340	929500	read this review? Yeah. This guy absolutely buys 15 machine guns, loads them up and just blazes
929500	935020	that restaurant to pieces in this, this review. It's, it is an absolute like assassination of
935020	939660	this restaurant. And now I love that New York times even went to Guy Fieri's, what's it called?
939660	947660	Bros and tits. Bros and tits and anus. It actually kind of made me want to go there. Like it,
947660	952620	that article made me be like, well, I got to see this. It sounded like, it sounds like a miniature
952620	957660	golf course of food, just like things in wrong scales and confusing. If on that menu or anywhere,
957660	963820	if you'd said it's the chicken McNugget teeny and you said it's, it's a McDonald's chocolate milkshake
963820	970380	with vanilla vodka, a barbecue sauce rim glass and a slice of chicken McNugget on the rim,
970380	977500	that would sell like gross McDonald's hotcakes. So have you sold this enough? No, we have it
977500	982460	because we have just a tiny bit of pride left. So we haven't ever sold it. But what happened was
982460	987900	this video went viral and we were like, oh shit. Because we didn't mean to be known for this. Like
987900	992300	I, I studied so hard in school. There's so many times where we'll do like, we'll be doing something
992300	1000060	in that alley. We'll be like magna colada. This is your penicillin. Yeah, this was my accident. Like
1000060	1004620	this was, this was my moldy dish after vacation. It was my, it was like this weird accident. It's
1004620	1008780	like a, a baby that you're like, let's not abort it. And then we just have raised it into a career.
1008780	1012460	I didn't go to college. So my parents are stoked that like I have a career.
1012460	1017420	And when you both made these, this was a joint like collaboration on it.
1018140	1022540	So since then, it was like 2009, we've made a fucking career out of this. We quit our jobs.
1022540	1026060	And like, this is our job. We ended up, it went viral. And then,
1026060	1029180	and then the New York Times contacted us and they're like, we'd like to do a feature story.
1029180	1033740	Can you fly out to New York so we can interview you? And we both collectively lost our shit. And
1033740	1038460	then, uh, and then food network offered as a contract. So we would, because of that. Yes,
1038460	1044380	I don't know. Well, here's why, because it sounds just ridiculous enough to be awesome.
1044380	1050140	Jeff, you're being impolite to our guests. No, I'm sharing their incredulity. I know,
1050140	1054140	but well, you shouldn't share people's incredulity about their success. You should let them be
1054140	1059820	incredulous. And you should assure them that it's for a reason. So that's, that's just like taking
1059820	1064780	their coat. I'm saying that I'm certain, I'm certain that they proved them. They're, they're
1064780	1072060	worthiness outside of that. That's hilarious. Their world-class holatrices.
1072540	1078380	Well, I want to talk to you guys about, about podcasting because you, for a very long time
1078380	1083500	now in a feral audio network, which is an amazing network, you've been doing, I don't know how else,
1084540	1090140	uh, like, like, I don't know what the terminology is. Like in, in, in terms of sitcoms, there's
1090140	1094140	single camera and multi-camera, which means there's an audience. Like there's an audience here.
1094140	1097980	There is not an audience. You guys have been doing the not an audience one for a while.
1097980	1102620	Have you, uh, and now you're, you're going to, are you just shifting gears entirely bailing on
1102620	1107500	the non-audience and doing the audience thing now? No way. I think we just want a more immediate
1107500	1113260	form of validation. So we're going good. I mean, we've done it with an audience of Dustin, the
1113260	1117980	producer, who's just out, like right outside the pillow fort. And if we say something really
1117980	1122700	disgusting, we'll hear him wince. Yeah. Like to get Dustin to laugh outside the room. You can hear
1123500	1129180	how heavily did you edit? Because like, I went through all these phases with this thing where
1129180	1133180	we would record this and then I would sit with, you know, try to schedule a time with Dustin and
1133180	1137980	go through it. And then we'd be sitting there in pro tools or whatever logic or a square five or
1137980	1143180	whatever the fuck kids use. Um, and, and, and going like, Oh, well that was kind of, that kind of
1143180	1147260	doesn't really go anywhere. So let's, let's, let's bring up that laugh and do all those things. And
1147260	1151580	we tried to minimize the dishonesty and like, I was trying to keep it to 90 minutes, all this stuff.
1151580	1157340	The more emails I got or Tumblr messages about people that were just going, you know what, I, I,
1157340	1162220	I listened to your podcast while I'm welding a mechanical bowl at work. I listened to your
1162220	1167100	podcast while I'm driving to and from work. I, they, it became very clear that part of the format
1167100	1173820	was that the, the, the people that really gobble it up, what they prefer more is a timely schedule
1174540	1179660	than a finally edited masterpiece. And so we just stopped editing at a certain point.
1179660	1183100	That makes total sense. And I don't like to listen to myself talk. So if I'm saying,
1183100	1187420	if I'm on doing the podcast and I say something like racist or like shitty that I know is bad,
1187420	1191580	I'm like, that's not that I ever did Dustin like that. Take that out. But like, I won't go back
1191580	1196540	and listen to it. And our best, our best like episodes have been our solo episodes when we're,
1196540	1201260	cause we're best friends, you know, fucking everything about each other. We know each other's
1201260	1205660	buttons to push. So the best episodes are when we're just totally candid and like,
1205660	1207500	have you guys ever been in a, like a actual fight?
1212300	1216860	No, no, no, no, no, no. I locked her out of a hotel room in New Orleans. But I mean,
1216860	1221740	that was the worst thing I've ever done. She busted through the fucking door. And I was like,
1225260	1229660	there's a monster outside. When they put the door, like the lock
1230380	1234700	when they meeting Allie who's locking door. I watched your crime constantly.
1236620	1240140	If you take a credit card or the room, you slide it through.
1241180	1244300	Good to know. My favorite thing about that is
1245820	1251340	everyone's groaning because you just armed a million. But my favorite thing about that is
1251340	1257740	the idea of the midst of a drunken hotel fight. One person will do something as delicate as
1258540	1262460	threading a needle. And then I'm sure you're right back to, fuck you,
1262460	1266700	bitch. I thought I was so smart. And really, I should have just gone and sat down and had
1266700	1269580	some water and like everything would have been fine. But I was like, I got it.
1270220	1272780	Where did you pick that up? Like watching like dog, the bounty hunter.
1272780	1278220	No, I watch, I obsessively watch shows about like people who have been, have murdered people.
1278220	1284060	Right. Like 48 hours. Yes. So my god, all of them. Hence I locked the hotel room door when
1284780	1288140	wait. So the little, the little hinging one was a little thing that slides in and kind of locks
1288140	1293020	in. You can, you can put a credit card through that credit card and like kind of slide the hinge
1293020	1299580	off. It's so easy. Life hacking. This is why I put yeah, it's our life hacking segment. Also,
1299580	1309660	you get a Mountain Dew bottle makes a great silencer. Yeah. You put a pillow inside a Mountain
1309660	1314700	Dew bottle. It has to be Mountain Dew for some reason. If you hold certain buttons down in a
1314700	1318300	certain elevators and you just, you bypass all the other floors. If you want to go straight down.
1318300	1322620	Oh, I did not know this. Yeah. If you hold the door, open or close button and hit a thing
1322620	1326940	and the floor you're going to, it just goes, fire departments use it to get in places.
1326940	1330940	So now I tell the world that, uh, so that the fire department, uh, so people die.
1332380	1336940	But if you hold it down a second too long, you end up on a special floor where the elevator master
1336940	1343820	goes, who brought you here? We have no way of knowing you have come up, but you can never go
1343820	1354140	down. Uh, you're just in a shitty like adjustment bureau movie. Uh, okay. What? I'm sorry. I was
1354140	1359260	asking about slumber. We're like murderers and slumber parties. Um, yeah, we have this,
1359260	1362860	we have a slumber party podcast. So we get in pajamas because it's comfortable. And then we
1363260	1367020	slumber parties that no one until now has been able to see, like you guys have actually pitched
1367020	1372220	to 10, you get in there and you make the guests feel comfortable. And then you talk to them.
1372220	1375740	And now you're going to start doing that in front of an audience. So there's challenges there.
1377660	1379740	Have you thought about them? No, no, actually.
1381820	1384380	Good thing. I'll be your first guest. Thank you for being our first guest.
1384380	1387580	Wait, so you're going to be, you're the first live guest of this lumber party.
1387580	1391340	Yeah. Are you going to wear PJs? Sounds like it. Yeah.
1391420	1397100	You wear like a little onesie or something. I have one. I got one from Paramount for
1397100	1402620	Christmas. It's like a red onesie. Is it a union suit? It's a little button.
1402620	1406220	Yeah. It looks like, it looks like, uh, I want you to get off my moonshine.
1409020	1414060	Uh, all right. Should we shift focus and talk about constitutional law and Justin Bieber?
1414060	1419180	Oh yes. He's on that scissor. He's, he's on that surf so bad.
1419180	1421100	Jeff, Jeff, what do you know about Justin Bieber?
1422060	1425180	Very precious little. I do know what's going on right now.
1425180	1430220	I do know that I was flipping channels and he is under felony charges for aching his neighbors.
1430220	1435020	Does anybody else in this audience have the immediate, do I have a personality disorder?
1435020	1435500	Yes.
1435500	1443180	Or within, within five seconds of those chyrons, are you upset about search and seizure? Are you
1443180	1448140	upset about, like, like all I heard was, uh, everybody's laughing about like, like, like,
1448140	1452780	like, I guess Justin Bieber egged, egged his neighbor's house and the cops. So the cops
1452780	1459580	raided his house and found cocaine. What? Wait, back up a million steps in the fucking constitution.
1459580	1466700	I know he's not American, but apparently either are we. What are you talking about? Oh, well,
1466700	1471980	I guess he had surveillance cameras. So they want to, that's self-incremented. What, what,
1472060	1479180	you can't, you can't, if I, I, I'm pretty sure if you search every house in California,
1479180	1484860	you're going to find some fucking cocaine. Let's just call that a given. Let's, let's,
1484860	1490380	let's make the assumption that in the eyes of the fucking government, which is a shitty,
1490380	1496860	joyless organization designed to govern, not to provide us with happiness, but to supposedly
1496860	1504140	protect it. Um, let's just assume that within the eyes of a faceless, inhuman organization,
1504140	1510540	like the government, every person's individual life is spent breaking the law. Let's assume that,
1510540	1515020	that if you pull every car over, there's something nasty in their trunk. If you go into anyone's
1515020	1520060	house, they got something that they're embarrassed about. That's why the founding fathers put a
1520060	1527900	little concept in the goddamn constitution called fucking privacy. We have privacy. We have a right
1527900	1532540	to be individuals. And when it comes to drugs, I think it's perfectly fine for a country with
1532540	1539020	a gross national product to say, well, at our borders, we're going to try to like put a throttle
1539020	1543660	on the amount of cocaine or heroin or whatever, whatever the fuck their business is. If you're
1543660	1549580	living in a country that has less pantyhose or more potted ferns because your giant country made
1549580	1553420	a social contract with some free trade agreement with some other country. Hey, that's tough titties
1553420	1557980	for you as an individual. You move countries or whatever the, or you're trapped there and you're,
1557980	1564700	you have less pantyhose. So, so, so goes drugs. But I think the idea has always been that by the
1564700	1571180	time a little bindle of cocaine gets into your front pocket at the local bar, you're allowed to
1571180	1576300	have it. Like, like, like, like you need to have done some fucked up shit before they're allowed
1576300	1582380	to find that shit. And people can't kick in your door. Did they burst in or did they actually have
1582380	1589100	access to the house? All I understood was that the kid egged a house. Obviously, he's been a bit of
1589100	1594780	an annoyance in his neighborhood. I have a feeling his neighbor is well hooked up. I picture his
1594780	1600620	neighbor being like a guy like me, like a 41 year old guy whose neighbor is Justin Bieber and is
1600620	1606540	like, or, or has had it for 20 years and who's and dines with cops and is like, fuck this fucking
1606540	1611340	kid. What it kind of reminds me of is like, when you hear about like people who were peeing in a
1611340	1616860	bush, which was how we met. Yeah, it actually is how we met. Get like, we'll go back to that.
1618860	1626060	And then have their like sex for sex crimes or what is it called? You know, like, thank you. But
1626060	1630940	then they're they're on the sex offender registry because it's almost like a like a thing where
1630940	1635100	they're like, come in for a free tour. And then they try to sell you a condo. It's like, well,
1635100	1638860	that's not really the same thing as that. And like egging a fucking house like he if he really
1638860	1643180	wanted to, he could have killed that guy. I saw I saw a couple days ago, God, fucking if Bieber
1643180	1648300	just whacks somebody, that'd be so good. What do you mean when you say if he really wanted to,
1648300	1652940	he could have whacked that guy? I'm just saying like, egging a house is a is an innocent, simple
1652940	1658460	way to get out your frustrations on this person. Over a certain dollar amount of damage. Oh,
1658460	1663260	I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. Well, apparently, there was $20,000 worth of damage,
1663260	1667100	which is believable when you egg a rich person's house. And I saw this news item a couple days
1667100	1671260	ago. So I don't know what I don't know what happened today. I guess they really got he's on
1671260	1675740	he's drinking copious amounts of cough syrup, sweet, which is so sad. People do that. Doesn't
1675740	1680540	you have any cocaine on him? The impression that I got when I first watched it was that
1681260	1686620	that, like, there was probably a bunch of people in his house, he throws parties, and people,
1686620	1690780	maybe him included, maybe not when egg the neighbor's house, and then the cops came in,
1690780	1695180	like, hey, we come in, sure. And then there was somebody had cooked, right? No, now I think it
1695180	1699340	was actually I think it was on one of his entourage, little, little, little personal pizza, whatever it
1699340	1706140	is. Let's say one of his one of his entourage, his name, little, little pee pee, writing dirty,
1706140	1711180	but but but but I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now, if you kick in my door, you're
1711180	1715500	gonna find some shit. I'm an American. Let's get over there right now. I'm trying to think.
1716300	1722540	I pursue my fucking right to happiness. And I do it on the on my own property. And if you
1722540	1728220	kick in my door, and you go through every inch of my house, you are going to find illegal shit.
1728220	1736060	God bless me. And the same went for George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who would
1736060	1740540	have been hung if they caught them because they were fucking treasonous terrorists.
1740540	1744540	They were forming a fucking country where people should mind their own goddamn business.
1744540	1749660	And I an egging a house is shitty. And if you can prove that you egged a house,
1749660	1754860	then you owe the guy 20 grand. And that is not fun. That is not a search warrant situation.
1754860	1758940	Well, I don't think they I would guess that it wasn't they broke they broke down the door
1758940	1762540	without a search warrant and started looking. No, they served him a warrant. I'm sure and I
1762540	1766060	think I think he was like, okay, but they can also say, can we come in? I think and they go,
1766060	1769660	yeah, you can come in when they come in and they see coke on the table, they go, what's this? And
1769660	1775820	they can bust whoever is anyways, team beeps. I'm just I'm just saying that you're you're
1775820	1783180	you've become a bit of a constitutional believer. And I'm going back to all of Justin Bieber's
1783180	1787180	crimes. And I'm going, you know what, and Frank probably would have been a believer. He had every
1787180	1796700	right to. I think he's getting I think he's getting punished for just being a tiny douchebag
1796700	1802460	is what's happened. Exactly. And that is if that's a crime, we're all in trouble, man, especially me.
1802460	1808300	Like, I need to kick my ass. Like, like, like, it needs to not be illegal to be unlikable. My
1808300	1812380	only problem with Justin Bieber is that he's rocking and made quite famous the haircut that
1812380	1817820	I had when I was four. I was doing the big sweepy thing a long time ago and fucking nothing.
1818780	1824780	No record deals. I also want to reach out to him and say from the bottom of my heart, I'm so sorry
1824780	1830940	about the photos they choose when you're being vilified. And the because man, they found when I
1830940	1837820	when I when I made my classic rape joke, boy, they found the yellowest teeth, like, like,
1837820	1846700	they just found like snarling photos of me going. And he's he's the he egged a house,
1846700	1851020	they found cocaine and there's every photos like him on the red carpet doing like a Corey Feldman
1851020	1860540	breakdancer. Can I here's my look, I love the Constitution as much as anybody, but I do think
1861260	1866860	that personal rights might have to be stepped in on when he's wearing the pants with the
1866860	1873420	crotches by the knees. Fucking no, then then no. Then you're under that meat crotches by the knees.
1873420	1878620	He has those pants, the sag, the saggy crotch pants were like the the the bells would be where
1878620	1884140	the normal pants would be wasted. But the crotch portion is down here. So you know what? It's full
1884140	1891100	of cocaine and eggs and cough syrup. Cocaine and eggs and cough syrup. Oh my. The heaviest habits
1891100	1900460	known to man. Just in case. Just in case. Oh, just in case. Good night, everybody. It's been our show.
1900460	1904780	Thank you for coming to Hermiton. Let's search her house. She made a pun.
1906940	1911020	Georgia, what's the worst thing they would find in your house? The worst thing they would. Georgia
1911020	1913820	and I have this game we play on slumber party because we ask slumber party questions. And one
1913820	1919820	of them is when you die, what's the worst thing? Feel free to include hard drives. Oh, hard drive.
1919820	1926300	And we're all fucked. You know, I got this isn't my house, but I stay friends with an ex
1926300	1932300	partly because he has videos and pictures. You know what I mean? And it's like, what's his name?
1932300	1938940	I'm just kidding. No, he, you know, I can't piss him off that much. Right. Because he has. What are
1938940	1944060	these videos? Can you get a broad strokes? Long term relationship videos. She was in a musical.
1944540	1950380	Yeah. Yeah. It's you and it's you and Pippin when you're at that. No, it's a
1951740	1957420	kinky scale one to 1010 being holy shit. Five. It's not that bad. Yeah. So yeah,
1957420	1962860	enough to enough to be embarrassing, but not, yeah, not felonious. My hair was terrible. You know?
1962860	1966940	Oh yeah. Is that what you're worried about? See, Dan, it seems to me that a lot of your
1966940	1973260	beef with this whole Justin Bieber break in is that the idea that your, your illegal stuff
1973260	1982300	at home isn't safe, right? It all, it all goes back to me taking a pee in first grade and all
1982300	1988220	of the kids at the urinal slowly looking over and laughing at me. And at that point, me realizing
1988220	1994460	that you're not supposed to drop your underwear and pants all the way to your ankles, which is
1994460	2000700	why Justin Bieber invented these new pants and it's the job is half done. Maybe there is overlap
2000700	2003900	there. Maybe people should be allowed to do whatever they want with their pant level too.
2011500	2016860	I never diagnosed myself with Asperger's. I never will. I'm 41. It takes too long,
2016860	2022380	too much money. I don't care, but, but I have achieved a lot of understanding about my
2022380	2027900	personality and the struggles I've gone through by, by participating or voyeuristically spying
2027980	2034860	on conversations between people on the spectrum on the internet, which I started doing accidentally
2034860	2040540	because I was writing this character that I didn't want to, I didn't want to get wrong. And, and I,
2040540	2046620	what I understand now very clearly is that there's a fit, like, we all share as a fear of alienation
2046620	2052380	and excommunication and that a lot of people have like these tendrils, these social cues, these
2052380	2057100	pickups and the things that like, like, like, like they just keep them safe. Like, like people,
2057100	2060780	there's people who are naturally buoyant to use the metaphor of a pool. And then there's people
2060780	2066460	who feel like they sink like a stone after a second, if they don't flail or grab something.
2066460	2072380	And I think when you're on the spectrum, you are, it's not, it's not the doing things wrong.
2072380	2076860	It's the realization that you can do things wrong and not even realize that you've been doing them
2076860	2083340	wrong until it's too late. And it's that fear that we all have of being kicked out. It's like,
2083340	2088220	I didn't know that if I egged my neighbor's house, you could fucking kick in my door.
2088220	2093580	We've both been pantsed before as young people. The panting was a formative.
2095580	2100060	In the lunchroom and just slapping you in the back of the head. And you have no idea it was
2100060	2105180	coming and you don't know why it happened. And then you find out because you're confused and
2105180	2109980	your hero is Spock or Dr. Who, and he gets to the bottom of things. Why did that happen? Why
2109980	2116540	did Troy do that? Troy did that because you spoke up in science class and you embarrassed him. You
2116540	2119820	raised your hand at the wrong time. You've been wearing those pants for too many days in a row.
2119820	2124140	Well, realizing you're the butt of the joke is like the most eye-opening thing, you know,
2124140	2127980	that happened when I was in fifth grade and got pants. And it was like, oh, like this is
2127980	2133660	funny to people. What was your reaction? Because I saw some girls go through some pretty traumatic
2133660	2139100	pantsings. Like really traumatic, like life-changing. Oh, yeah. Mine was in seventh grade.
2139900	2143340	I was in a fight with my friend, Laura. She was not drunk and not in a hotel room, but
2144860	2149740	her boyfriend was a dick. And yeah, like a whole group of them are like, hey, Laura wants to talk
2149740	2155100	to you. And then Kenji, her boyfriend came up behind me and pulled the guy down. And it was
2155100	2161660	like I had a whole group of people watching. I remember the same thing, slow motion, my entire
2161740	2166300	fifth grade class. Down to the knickers or down to fully nude? Just underwear. I think just underwear.
2166300	2171260	But still, like you don't get pantsed if you're like a popular kid. We both were really,
2171260	2176380	oh yeah, super dorks, hated ourselves, total nerds. And then that happened. I slapped Kenji
2176380	2181180	in the fucking face though. I clawed this girl's arm. It's funny that you guys have the slumber party
2181180	2186060	motif though, because slumber parties were really even beyond any scholastic environments. Slumber
2186060	2193420	parties, your closest friends, also the place where the knife could go in the deepest. I had
2193420	2197740	my best times and my worst times at slumber parties, where we called them sleepovers because
2197740	2205900	we were dudes. But the reason why you always wanted to have sleepovers is because you
2206940	2213260	wanted to be participatory of the most joyous moments of young life. And those spikes would
2213260	2216620	come and those are like jumping up and down and you're friends and you're having a great time.
2216620	2221260	But then up my worst memories are at slumber parties where I'm suddenly realizing again,
2221260	2226860	like, wait, what the fuck? What did I, wait, me? I'm the scapegoat? No, that's the worst. Did you
2226860	2231260	guys have a meeting about this? That's the worst, but that's the worst fear. That's the fear that's
2231260	2236220	so weirdly universal to humanity. And I wouldn't get like, I wouldn't get like, like down or about
2236220	2240140	it, but it's something that I struggled with my whole life. I mean, like, what if everyone fucking
2240220	2244700	hates me and I have no idea. So when a helicopter shot of Justin Bieber's house is on a thing, like,
2244700	2250940	my mind doesn't automatically go to, fuck that guy. He's so popular and rich. My mind goes to,
2250940	2257900	fuck the police. Fuck. Like, I know there's police out there that are so, such great people. I don't,
2257900	2263420	like, like, thank God there are decent people who've signed up for that job. But, but I'm just
2263420	2268940	saying as a, as an institution, like, if I'm watching someone's house get raided on CNN, like,
2269020	2273260	I never go. I don't care how famous they are. Like I, first we have to hate the government,
2273260	2279820	then we have to hate famous people in that order. So important because famous people can't yet,
2279820	2283740	all they can really do is fuck with your brain a little bit and lower your taste.
2283740	2287500	Like the government can really do a lot of damage with too much power. Those things don't really
2287500	2292780	make sense. Egging to raiding. Don't they, you know, it's charming sheen. You'd be like, well,
2294460	2298380	if there was a news story that broke about a little kid that eggs somebody's house and then,
2298460	2303740	and then the cops raided, raided their house, like under the right demographic circumstances,
2303740	2307340	that would be all over Facebook. It's like an example of police, like, that happens every
2307340	2311020	night all across the country. I'm certain the people it's called raiding people's houses who
2311020	2316620	didn't even egg people because they live in the wrong neighborhood. If somebody, if you're,
2316620	2322140	if you live in a wealthy neighborhood and you are a non-famous child living in that neighborhood or
2322140	2328540	youngster, like he is, and you decide to do shitloads of like, like grand, like, like heavy
2328540	2332460	duty damage to your neighbor's house, the cops are coming. They're going to come into your house if
2332460	2337340	you allow them in. If you go, no, sir, that would have a warrant. They go, all right. They'll have to
2337340	2341580	play mother rules. But if you let them in and they find drugs there, you go to jail, everybody there
2341580	2346060	gets questioned and all that shit happens. Helicopters come because he's Justin Bieber.
2346140	2352940	But those are news coppers. I understand coppers. I understand. But the whole thing in total that
2352940	2359180	disturbs me is that the entire thing adds up to something that we all just take for granted,
2359180	2364140	which is that, oh, well, he had it coming. Now, wait a minute. I don't care who had it coming.
2364140	2369980	I watched enough law and order. I love me some Sam Waterston, like, like the rule of law is what's
2369980	2375580	important. It doesn't matter who had it coming. You can't shoot someone in the face because they,
2375580	2380540	you know, like until after the law fails you anyway, like, like, like, you know, like, like,
2380540	2386220	you can't you can't like, and we can't just look at somebody and go like, oh, well, he was a dick
2386220	2391500	about that monkey thing on the airline. And he he's there's been all kinds of stories about him.
2391500	2396780	So fuck him. No, not fuck. It's just that people are under charges right now. Has he been like
2396780	2401260	arrested or I don't know. I gave up at my outrage. I had something to talk about. So I stopped
2401260	2405820	researching. He was in the news today for drinking for drinking a shit ton of weird cough syrup,
2405820	2409740	which is so slumming it. But I but on that point, though, I think there's something really interesting
2409740	2415100	about like, about hive mind and about there's have you ever heard of this syndrome, the term
2415740	2421900	tallest poppy syndrome, where it's this it's a it's like a metaphor for the tallest poppies in
2421900	2427100	opium crops get cut because they don't conform. So this idea that something rises above and it's
2427100	2434780	bigger and it's it's, it's more conspicuous than gets the nature human nature is to chop it. And
2434780	2441340	so it's that's the I think it's above constitutional law concerns. It's also that that that's Harrison
2441340	2447580	Berger on the but that's celebrity. But that's celebrity as we're uncomfortable with a kid who
2447580	2453020	put a YouTube video up and became a billionaire at 12. That's my problem. I don't see than any one of
2453020	2456780	those. I don't like that hypocrisy. I thought I thought our country was supposed to be about
2456780	2462780	innovation and this whole stuff. I don't the glee that we take in raising people up. It's like,
2462780	2467260	there if somebody is that famous, it's because everybody loved them. And then we crucify them.
2469020	2475980	I don't like that. And neither did God. Hence the New Testament. It's not a cool behavior. And we
2476540	2480940	fucking don't learn our lesson. But all of that is a reflection also, and this is super cheesy,
2480940	2485660	but of how much you actually like yourself. And if you hate yourself, you want everyone to hate
2485660	2488540	themselves. And if you're okay with yourself, you don't give a shit what people think about
2488540	2493260	themselves. And so the idea that if you're in this cycle of like, I suck, I suck, everyone hates me,
2493260	2496220	I must be terrible. What's wrong with me? Is there something wrong with me? I don't know about am I
2496220	2500940	okay today? You're ever you're gonna want you're gonna wish failure on everyone. Yeah, and you're
2500940	2505500	gonna feel fine with it. It's like throwing a rock at the moon. That's every day on Twitter,
2505500	2510700	somebody like takes a shot at me, you know, 85,000 people hug me and make me feel wonderful
2510700	2514780	about myself. And then one person goes like, Hey, fuckface, why are you so fat and untalented?
2515820	2521340	And of course, I go like, well, let's talk about this. And I get out my eyeglasses, and I want to
2521340	2527660	talk to them. And I like over and over and over again, it's the same thing. It's like this person
2527660	2532620	that no matter how they want to dress it up, regardless of what form they take, it's this
2532620	2541420	person that is actually quite shocked. In the end, that like I would go, Hey, what? Because they
2541420	2547420	the first thing they say is they go like, what a loser talking to me? What the fuck? That's sad.
2548060	2552620	You don't want to? Well, why did you talk to me? Are you doing it? Like, do you just think of
2552620	2558940	thinking you and then 90% of them go like, Look, maybe I misspoke. I'm just saying like, I think,
2559340	2566940	like, like, it's our celebrity worship is they think you're invincible is dangerous. And they
2566940	2574700	think that and that's just me. Like, I exist in a safe part of that pond. You look at the things if
2574700	2583500	you ever go to like a Kardashians Instagram. And some girl takes a photo of herself and says,
2583500	2592460	I'm having fun at the zoo. I'm a Kardashian. And the things like, it's just kill yourself. You
2592460	2597420	should kill yourself. If you don't kill yourself, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna hire someone to kill
2597420	2602940	you. Your head looks stupid. Your face looks stupid. I you shouldn't be at the zoo. You're
2602940	2610140	a horrible person. I hope your face gets ripped off by that animal. I hope you're I don't I've
2610220	2615580	never watched the Kardashians show. I don't know what these people do. That's so wrong. But it's so
2615580	2621100	disturbing. We always want like, have like, like, struggle with the thought of like, promoting
2621100	2625420	ourselves like, and being like, Look at me doing this thing. And look at us doing this thing. And
2625420	2630220	hey, we're gonna be even like a harm in town. And it's like, are we bragging? What's in? Are we
2630220	2634700	inviting people to be annoyed with us and to hate us? Yeah, that's a lot. I got a documentary coming
2634700	2639900	out about myself. That's gonna go well. That's gonna go real well. I can't wait to read the AV
2639900	2647820	club review of the documentary I produced about myself. That's gonna go that's gonna make me feel
2647820	2654460	fantastic. But all of that is you'll notice like the like the more invincible and the more on top
2654460	2660060	people seen then the more than the more of that like, shopping Poppy syndrome you see and so you
2660060	2664460	have to understand and take that with some kind of weird almost like but and I don't know if this is
2664460	2667980	part of the solution or part of the problem. But I think what you're suggesting is that a healthy
2667980	2676540	person would would look at each knife as a hug. Like, I don't know if that turns you into a monster.
2676540	2680380	Isn't that the definition of a sociopath? I think what you do is look at the person on the other
2680380	2684460	side of the knife and realize that they're these sad people who are never gonna affect your life.
2685420	2691180	In their mind, the blade on the knife is a nerf blade. Yeah, I mean, they're trying to get your
2691180	2695020	attention. That's what they're doing. So there's something about them that needs. It's almost like
2695020	2701100	an Andy Kaufman routine where it's like, like, like he just went fuck it. If people are booing you,
2701900	2705820	that's part of the act. Like he didn't it didn't affect him that way. But you just said Dan that
2705820	2710860	you know that 85,000 people hug you and one person says you're fat and that drives you crazy. Like you
2711580	2716140	you don't think that you're going to get 100% of the people to say nice things to you on
2716140	2719820	right online. So intellectually, you understand that there's a percentage of people who are going
2719820	2725180	to say that. No, I understand that all intellectually. But that's just like I don't I'll look here.
2725180	2733420	Here's the thing. Everyone loved the last episode of community. But five seconds into reading the
2733420	2741420	praise of the last episode of community, I started to get bummed out because the praise came in the
2741420	2749740	form of this is the funniest episode of community since season two, which made me go bad job. It's
2749740	2754940	season three. I made a realization and I'll make it again for the rest of my life. It's too late
2754940	2760700	for me. I'll never be mentally healthy. But it's another epiphany in my epiphany drawer. I my work
2760700	2766380	my relationship with strangers will never make me happy. That's how sick I am. Yes, I realize all
2766380	2770220	these things. The logical realization of it doesn't it doesn't doesn't mean anything. But do you think
2770220	2776460	that this that you're self hatred and we both have it in certain doses, like helps fuel you as a
2776460	2782460	person because you you hate yourself yet you've made this incredible like career doing something
2782460	2787740	you love and are good at. But you know, if you liked yourself, would you have tried so hard to
2787740	2793100	prove? No, exactly. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's a problem is that and that validation is the reward
2793100	2797180	for ambition, which can a lot of times be fueled by the need for validation. So you if you are like,
2797180	2800860	oh, fuck, I got a hole in my bucket, you're going to keep trying to fill your bucket. And you're
2800860	2804300	like, I still got a hole in it. I think the key has something to do with that hole. The hole in
2804300	2811740	the bucket has to you have to let that lead you into vocational ambition. Yeah, where it will
2811740	2818220	never be fulfilled. And you have to then simultaneously somehow, I'm miming like some bucket
2818220	2825660	going underwater. It looks like some weird thing. But but like, look, while that while that income
2825660	2833900	that unfillable void directs you forward, in terms of the things you output, you simultaneously have
2833900	2842700	to derive your emotional well being from your dog, your fiance, your, which are amazing. You have
2842700	2849020	not mine. I have neither. And you have to not let those things that's the thing like you can't like
2849020	2855420	you have to like, yeah, you just have to go like, okay, I'm a person who can never do anything right
2855420	2860140	for anybody. So I'm gonna always like until I drop dead, like Robert Altman, I'm just gonna like
2860140	2864220	make things like Woody Allen, I'll just make things like those are great. They're heroes of
2864220	2868220	ours, because they're prolific. But they compartmentalize because obviously, if Woody
2868220	2874620	Allen ever allowed people's opinions of his personality, his output, there would have been
2874620	2879820	a little bit of a divot at a certain point in his career. And there wasn't he better not egg anyone.
2879820	2885100	He should never know that was pretty shitty. Well, yeah, I mean, he's a he's psychologically
2885100	2890460	probably a monster, but he's not listening. And he won't punch a mirror when you say that,
2891260	2896140	unlike me. And that's where I fall short, like a punch a mirror. But but that's I mean,
2896140	2902860	that's the thing is, is in for me, we would not have multiple TV shows if out of a McNuggetini
2902860	2909180	video, if I didn't have an unfillable void. My anxiety and depression wasn't fueled on like,
2909180	2913180	but you're not doing enough enough. We wouldn't have Yeah, we wouldn't have
2913180	2922460	I have no ambition. I have zero. I don't think I'm crazy enough to be that talented
2922460	2926060	or that funny. Like, I feel like I don't think I'm talented. I know I work my ass off the guilt
2926060	2930460	of having some a partner that you have to I would have never done this on my own. Like the guilt of
2930460	2933580	being like, well, I was going to be disappointed if I don't write this thing or like, well, I have
2933580	2937180	to show that I'm carrying my weight. And so when you have someone to work with like that, it really
2937180	2941260	helps. I'm the deadline bitch a lot of times. So I keep I don't like people like you that have
2941260	2946620	ambition that have I don't like people that have holes in their bucket because you guys are all
2946620	2952060	the people are getting shit done. You guys know, you guys have careers and shit like that.
2952060	2955340	No, I actually had a weird and I don't know if this is you guys don't know me. So I don't know
2955340	2959580	if this is weirdly personal, but I had a fucking the last couple weeks I we've both had really
2959580	2963740	hard years. We've had terrible years. And if you listen to Slumber Party with Ali and George on
2963740	2968460	Peril Audio, we the one of our episodes was called Flash Flood of Sadness because like in the one
2968460	2973900	month, like we just we both went through all kinds of weird shit outside of our control. And so I've
2973900	2979660	had like this terrible hard year. And I have beat myself up a million times for how I am not enough.
2979660	2984060	I didn't handle it well. I'm everyone must hate me, blah, blah, blah, blah. I if I send a birthday
2984060	2987900	gift late, I'm like, oh, I'm a monster. I'm associated. I should kill myself. Like I should
2987900	2995900	Kardashian myself at the zoo. I'm the worst. And I just recently, like, just recently finally was
2995900	3000380	like, I can't do this anymore. No one wants me to hate myself. I keep thinking everyone will like
3000380	3005820	me more if I'm successful and have it together. And I'm like, not hideous. And I have like a show
3005820	3009820	with my best friend. As long as I hate myself, I'm acceptable. And I was like, no, no one wants me to
3009820	3013980	hate myself. I'm that's makes me more of a garbage person. So I'm just like, fuck it. I'm just going
3013980	3023260	to be okay with it and worry about other shit. So I'm able to accept your applause.
3024220	3029180	There is there is there is always an outrage underneath every heckle when you confront it
3029180	3032140	that the people go like, well, wait a minute, what the fuck are you doing? You're standing
3032140	3036220	in front of me. You're you're running your mouth. I'm not allowed to shoot a paintball gun at you.
3036220	3040140	That's all I'm doing. Yeah, I have my own issues, but I'm not a celebrity, blah, blah, blah, blah,
3040140	3045980	blah. They unfold all this stuff. And then we go, well, oh, look, look at all the hypocrisy of your
3045980	3049980	point of view and all this shit. They're like, yeah, I'm not in that business. Fuck off. Like,
3050620	3056380	I'm a fucking audience member. Like, I don't know. I'm sitting on Twitter. I'm just like
3056380	3060940	tweeting that Dan Harmon's an asshole. I didn't I didn't expect Dan Harmon to fucking come down
3060940	3068060	on me like a goddamn like weird cloud. But I'm going to keep doing it because it freaks them out
3068060	3072380	so much. Like all the other people like the percentage of people in this room who have
3072380	3077340	tweeted at you is probably really low. But the percentage of people who like appreciate you and
3077340	3081020	like you. And I mean, like, think about the people that you used to love when you were growing up.
3081020	3086060	And there was no way to tell them ever. Yeah, exactly. And also, if I knew that like Kyle
3086060	3090140	McLaughlin from Twin Peaks, like was really sensitive about how people perceived him,
3090140	3095100	I would have liked him less. I don't want to know the ins and outs of his fucking relationship with
3095100	3099100	his self image. Now that I know what it's like for someone to come up to me and be like, I love your
3099100	3103660	show. Like I saw Jellibee Afra outside of a bar like years ago, I should have been like, you
3103660	3107740	changed everything. But and I was like, I'm going to annoy him. I'm not going to say anything. But
3107740	3112220	like, these people are really stoked. But I would have retweeted Jeanine Garofalo all the time. I
3112220	3118860	would have spent my entire adolescence just arching like more look of horses. I had no access
3118860	3123740	to that. I just had to stare at them from afar and read liner notes. So I mean, that's a totally I
3123740	3129100	mean, people I think now celebrities or people, tallest poppies are much more porous in that way.
3129100	3134060	I think that they're much their their membranes are much more permeable to that criticism and
3134060	3138060	not I don't think people who are in this business necessarily take praise with the way that they do
3138060	3142060	criticism. And that's a big thing that you just have to like get zen about or else you're gonna
3142060	3146620	be the tallest poppies are more sensitive to the sun and are reaching higher and are represented
3146620	3153500	biosphere in which poppies are gonna get taller. Everyone's on opium. Because yeah, like, but it's
3153500	3159100	true. Like, like, because there's not there is no Cary Grant of the year 2050. That doesn't work
3159100	3163820	that way anymore. There's no newsreel going, Hey, who's that with Marilyn Monroe on the red carpet?
3163820	3167740	It's only gonna be a bunch of people that are like, Hey, what'd you say about me? Fuck you.
3169500	3173580	Because everyone's gonna be you're not gonna be allowed to be famous if you're not accessible.
3173580	3177420	Having to reveal more and more about yourself. Are you gonna like you have to be this you can't be
3177420	3182140	this character, you have to be like, here's how flawed I am. Or like here, here's everything about
3182140	3186940	me that you need to know. I would say like, like, throughout time, like, the Mount Olympus of,
3186940	3189660	you know, the people that we allowed to be celebrities, there are people that we don't
3189660	3194460	want to touch. There are people that we that are sacrosanct. We always give like some George Clooney,
3194460	3198140	like a little like, yeah, George Clooney, or a little Beyonce, like, okay, she's safe,
3198140	3201820	like, we'll fucking leave her alone. You know, when people were being vicious to each other
3201820	3205100	throughout the years, like, nobody out of Barbra Stanwerk or Doris Day, because they're fucking
3205100	3209980	beloved. And everybody knew that they were gay, they knew them, but they didn't say it.
3210060	3215260	Because I found out right now. Yeah, because I made it up. No. But, but like, there are people
3215260	3219500	that we do want to be Apollo and an Aphrodite. And there's also people that we want to be
3220300	3223980	punished. We want those people that we want to cast away like Madonna from the beginning.
3224700	3229340	Like, it's not like she was beyond reproach. Like, like, like, she was a sex symbol. And she was
3229340	3234780	world conquering. And everyone knew her name. But at the same time, she represented an archetype
3234780	3241500	that was like inviting everyone's bile. We don't have a Cary Grant. I mean, you know,
3241500	3246780	George Clooney is doing his level best to probably not without trying to, we're forcing
3246780	3252700	it on him to be a guy that people really want to like. And he's, he's making it very easy for us
3252700	3256780	to like George Clooney. He doesn't. And even if he ever did something bad, people wouldn't fucking
3256780	3260940	talk about it. Like when I was a kid, like, as I mentioned before, I was in a play with
3260940	3266700	Yul Brynner, if you guys know him as an actor from the 50s. And, you know, he was a big sex
3266700	3272460	symbol for many years and a big hotshot in his giant movies. And when we were, we did like 13
3272460	3277260	cities on this tour before I went to Broadway. And we were in Cincinnati. It was opening night.
3277260	3280780	And we were on the whatever the river is there. Is it the Ohio River? What is it?
3281900	3284620	And there was a riverboat. And that was where opening night party was. And there was always
3284620	3289820	local dignitaries and press and, you know, like kind of local hotshots and possibly a mayor would
3289820	3294620	come to these parties. And the kids, there were 13 of us, seven that traveled and seven local kids
3294620	3300540	that filled out the kid portion of the cast. We would all walk up on this procession and meet him.
3301180	3307580	And I learned, I mean, I was raised in kind of an old school like LA kind of very mannerly
3307580	3312140	environment where you said good evening and how do you do and stuff like that. But we were suits.
3312140	3316140	And my understudy was brand new in the job. And he was a kid named Luke from Philadelphia. He was
3316140	3321340	very crass, very, you know, like Irish Catholic working class kid, really funny, but really,
3321340	3325900	you know, like rough around the edges compared to, you know, like the rest of us probably.
3326620	3330220	And his dad was this, you know, tough old, you know, Irish guy is hilarious.
3330780	3335180	And he was in front of me and he was first time meeting Yule and in front of everybody,
3335180	3340380	his cameras, you know, for the local newspapers. And he walks up and he goes, hi. And Yule just
3340380	3346540	goes, boom. It just smashes him with this giant hand across his face. Absolutely clobbers this
3346540	3351660	10 year olds, 10 year olds. And I'm right behind him. And I, I never seen Yule hit anybody,
3351660	3356060	but I knew that like you don't fucking cross. He's the king on and off stage. And he was a bad
3356060	3362220	old school motherfucker who was dying of cancer. And who was a robot cowboy? Yes. And who said to
3362220	3370540	him, go back to your mama. Is that what he said? No, in Westworld. Okay. Westworld quote for nobody.
3373420	3377180	Fucking rent Westworld. He fucking gives Richard Benjamin the fucking time of his life.
3377180	3380060	I love that you just got, he really gives Richard Benjamin what how.
3381180	3386220	What how? Anyway, you got one person snapping to that, by the way, like a beat,
3386220	3390780	like a beat audience, just like a glorious and disgusting. And I love it. It's Adam Goldberg.
3393180	3395100	And I did, I did not rub your lamp at him. Be quiet.
3397340	3401420	So anyway, so he's, so Yule just bashes this kid and he gives him this big model. Like
3402060	3405340	you're in the presence of ladies. You don't say, hi, you say, how do you do? You say,
3405340	3409660	good evening. I gave him this big ass thing. And the thing is the guys with the cameras,
3409660	3414140	the press that were there put their cameras down. Right. And like this kid's getting the
3414140	3418940	fucking talking to, he's getting the rules right now. No, look, the Irish Catholic father of Luke,
3419580	3424620	who was, you know, he diabetes, he had scoliosis, one leg was fucking a foot shorter than the other
3424620	3429980	one. Like he, this guy had been through wars and shit. He, like his fists came up, uh, and then
3429980	3437340	put him right back down because like, like there was, there was a status ladder and Yule just gave
3437340	3442220	him this fucking talking to. And I mean, the sound it made when he hit this kid was a fucking major.
3442220	3449740	Okay. So let's not live in that world. But if paratroopers come in through the skylight then
3449740	3455260	and arrest Yule Brenner for the future crime of child murder, then I'm on Yule Brenner's side.
3457100	3461580	The reason I bring that up, that we lived in a time when, when, when celebrities misbehaved,
3461580	3466460	that wasn't news. Now any bit of misbehavior is front page news at all times. Gloriously,
3466460	3471020	the concept of celebrity, hopefully interesting to watch how this happens. It's like a paint
3471020	3477100	pigment. That's like, you know, how you can't, you used to, I, I feel like from watching old
3477100	3483100	black and white, you know, culture and stuff that you could count the number of celebrities on a
3483100	3488220	couple of hands, like, and that, and that the list dropped off really fast. You didn't like
3488220	3494540	have like, you didn't know who, who was famous beyond like 10 people. And that now it's just
3494540	3499740	more, it's more stratified kind of like, obviously it's just like, Oh, my, my neighbor has a podcast
3499740	3505180	and she's got a thousand listeners, uh, which I think is very healthy and very good, but it's
3505180	3512380	like, it's being infected by this old world concept of celebrities as a class. I disagree
3512380	3516780	with that though. I think we've needed celebrity since before we had to Twitter or podcasts. Like,
3516780	3522540	if you look like I studied Latin in college or in high school and AP Latin only will person in my
3522540	3527500	class. It was me and Mrs. BCO. She's dead now. Don't worry about it. Um, it was just me and her,
3527500	3531740	but you know, so you study, when you study the classics and, and you know, Roman and Greek
3531740	3535100	mythology, you learn about demigods and you learn about there's Zeus and then he's got a whole bunch
3535100	3539420	of people that are like half a year and they're half human, they're half gods. And that is who
3539420	3545100	you look to, to learn like how the fuck to grow grain and like how not to get smoked essentially.
3545100	3551420	But I mean, between that and like sun gods and gods of rain, I think, and royalty through before
3551420	3556300	we had media, the kind of technology that we have now to be like, so in everyone's face.
3556300	3559980	People need to talk about, they need to go like paint it in your Hermes, fuck the swan.
3559980	3564940	Yeah, we need something to guide us. Back, back when there was only the radio and, and before TV,
3564940	3567980	and then when there was TV and there was, there was three channels and then there was five and then
3567980	3572860	there was a million. And now there's, everybody has a podcast and a, and a YouTube channel and
3572860	3577660	stuff like that. We still want to classify the people around us, the celebrities that we choose
3577660	3581900	to, to put on pedestals. And the reason why we erect pedestals is for the purpose of knocking
3581900	3587740	them off. Exactly. When that happens in the, in that fucking glory, glorious two weeks when
3587740	3591580	Charlie Sheen was becoming the greatest thing that ever fucking happened. Everybody was just like,
3591580	3597020	okay, this is fucking exciting. Whether or not you loved it, hated it, didn't give a shit. You were,
3597020	3601660	you were violently indifferent to it. You were indifferent to it. And in a, in a slow news
3601660	3606300	week, if Dan and Chevy Chase get in a fight, that's because Charlie Sheen isn't doing it on a fucking
3606300	3612620	way bigger level. We do need to cast. I'm offended by that. I'm kidding about that. I'm saying,
3612620	3619660	well, you aren't, uh, like, uh, we, we, we have to cast our, I'm definitely kidding about wanting
3619660	3625660	to be more famous than Charlie Sheen. We have to cast, uh, our, our gods and demigods. We have to
3625660	3629820	create our Mount Olympus at all times. Now it's so diffused because we have a million Charlie
3629820	3636940	sheans. I agree with all of you. I think that the reason why, I think that in days when media was,
3636940	3643180	what was, uh, very, very limited, where it was just one way transmission of like, uh, imagery,
3643180	3647580	then what we had that perfect harmony with that golden age where they basically supplanted what
3647580	3652540	you're describing an ancient Greek, ancient Roman society where you had like the mystery gods and I,
3652540	3656700	I worship Isis and I have a statue of sojour. Yeah, but did you hear Isis as the reason why
3656700	3660060	there was a float last week? Yeah. Fuck that bitch. All right. She's all right. She's all right.
3660620	3666860	Um, you know, like, like it was sort of like, it was gossip and soap opera all tied into religion
3666860	3671180	and it was civic and it worked as long as the society worked and then the barbarians at the
3671180	3676940	gate and then the monotheism and whatever the, the, the, the only thing that I'm saying is that
3677500	3684780	nowadays, now that we have so much access to everything, we were coming off of a,
3685740	3691980	a, uh, industry where select the concept of fame and celebrity had so much dollar value per
3692860	3703660	ounce that, uh, it, it doesn't, it's incompatible right now that you would hold the third lead of
3703660	3712700	vampire diaries or someone whose blog is taking off to this Cary Grant kind of standard. It's
3712700	3717900	where we're seeing as a sort of a blender of weirdness. I, I, I certainly feel that way
3717900	3725020	as a person who never wanted to be regarded as anything in particular except by a couple of
3725020	3731100	people. Like I, I, they, that that's what I'm saying is that there's a lot of fame to go around
3731100	3735580	and I do think we can, we'll always have George Clooney's that we can launch to the moon and we
3735580	3741420	can watch them explode in space and now famous. So I think the idea now, because, uh, the internet
3741420	3746540	being what it is, uh, the amount of efficacy people have that they can rumble you and you
3746540	3751500	can be rumbled and then the crack can come out from the sea and start laying waste to start like
3751500	3757180	engaging like the townsfolk. But also I think people see famous, something much more attainable
3757180	3761180	now because you can become a, like a, and they should, everyone can be famous. That's what I
3761180	3767340	wonder about. That way first stop looking at your life as miserable and start realizing that
3767340	3775020	although it doesn't pay anything tomorrow, you can be seen by a million people and that's why
3775020	3779660	every fucking day you turn a TV on, there's some guy who shot up a school. Uh, everybody can be
3779660	3784220	famous. Those people are having a fucking breakdown because of some kind of like, I think they don't
3784220	3789580	matter. They don't matter. They don't matter. They're supposed to matter. There's another's
3789580	3795740	recourse. I don't exist. I can exist for 48 hours in the fucking national media. Like I can, like,
3795820	3800780	I can be notorious. I can trade in all my mortgage and all my mom's yelling at me or whatever the
3800780	3807340	situation I'm in. I'm going to kill myself anyway. I think I'll, I'll go blow away a syrup factory.
3807340	3811260	Yeah. I'll be, I'll be, I'll be a, I'll be a shitty John Wilkes booth. Cause they make sweets.
3811260	3816300	I'll be a John Wilkes booth kind of, you know, I'll be, I'll be like, um, it's, uh, we've, we've,
3816300	3822380	we've made fame something that you can't just choose. Like the, the tribe has to choose
3822380	3826300	who gets on the pedestal and the tribe gets to stand around that pedestal and decide whether or
3826300	3833020	not it's a holdover from the idea that everyone knowing who you are equated to money. I think
3833020	3837980	that some, you know, it seems like you won the lotto, like why Jennifer Lawrence than some other
3837980	3843260	blonde actress? Like it could have been anyone. And you know, the, the, the third lead on whatever
3843260	3848940	the vampire diaries is making so much fucking money off of that. Right. And everyone, it seems
3848940	3853340	like an easy thing to attain these American idol shows and things like that. But they,
3853340	3858300	like, I don't know, I don't know how these people fare afterward, but I know the miracle of that
3858300	3861740	show is that they actually, now you're just famous cause you're on American idol. Cause it's a fucking
3861740	3868220	popular show. But my God, that promise of like, and the winner will be a famous singer. Yeah. Just
3868220	3873180	like that. Um, they kind of, they kind of end up being a famous singer because everyone was watching
3873180	3880860	that show lasted 20 years. It was major league baseball, but, but like, it, it, it's American
3880860	3886940	though. That's a weird America. American expansion was based on like, shit, there's gold and everyone
3886940	3891820	ran to it. And like, and you know, California was settled because we had gold up north and we had
3891820	3895980	movies down here. So we had like gold and fame. And so that's the only reason why any of you are
3895980	3902140	sitting here to expand on that metaphor, because there was only so much you can do with a pickax
3902220	3906940	or a stick of dynamite. There's only so much gold you can get out of the earth. And then
3907500	3913980	if you have the technology to point a ray and just go and scan the planet and go,
3913980	3920700	this planet is 10% gold. Okay. I'll take it. The planet move away. That's what the internet is.
3921660	3928060	Whatever you have to offer, give it to me. I'll take it for free. I'll download it. I don't care.
3928060	3933340	There's no, it's not gold. Maybe the gold is limited because if the gold is talent,
3933340	3938540	but fucking I'll take it and I'm not going to pay you that much for it. Like I, and Snickers
3938540	3942460	ain't going to get paid for it. Nike ain't going to get paid for it. Like, like those are the days
3942460	3947420	in which we live. So all of us people who want to be heard and want to like, like our narcissists
3947420	3951900	and want to output stuff, we're living in the golden age, but we're not going to get any money
3951900	3957820	for it. I don't know. Well, I think if McDonald's offered us any money, I think I would, I would have
3957900	3962700	no, you take it. They're not going to, I would say no. But I mean, that's a, that's the thing is like,
3962700	3967260	is, you know, we have some one dumb video that led to now, this is our job. This is our career.
3967260	3971180	I make more now than I ever did at the times. And that the times also, uh, if we wanted coffee
3971180	3976460	creamer, we had to pay 15 cents. And once I had to look under my floor mats in my 1993 Subaru
3976460	3980940	to buy coffee cream, I only charged her 10 cents for coffee. That's true. But I mean, but that's
3980940	3986060	the thing is it is, um, it is that gold rush and it is, it is that idea that like anyone here
3986060	3990460	sitting in front of us or listening to this could have some idea that no one's ever really had. And
3990460	3997420	then in 72 hours, someone's aunt would be like, did you see the thing? And then your door opens,
3997420	4000540	then there's something there. Okay. You can look at that two ways. You can look at that as like
4000540	4004140	gross. Everyone needs validation. Everyone wants to be famous. Everyone's a whore. Oh my God,
4004140	4008380	who's going to notice me? My bucket has a hole in it. Or you can look at it as we have a platform
4008380	4015020	and a voice. We essentially, everyone in like 2005 was handed a megaphone and it's very loud
4015020	4019660	and it's very noisy, but everyone has more areas of jazz. So that's how people talk now. I think
4019660	4025020	it's great that everyone has a podcast. When, when, when, when, when I got a podcast, I was the,
4025020	4030300	I was the 450 millionth person. I, there was no way I was going to convince myself that it was
4030300	4034620	doing anything innovative by saying, I'm going to have a podcast. I, I bit that bullet. I was like,
4034620	4040700	yeah, but podcasts are awesome. That I like, that's just, uh, like there's the alternatives
4040780	4045180	of people tweeting about like, like, everyone's got a podcast. Well, where is that going to get
4045180	4049660	you? I'm all over the place, but I'm just saying like, like, and I don't think this issue needs
4049660	4054460	to be resolved. I think we're boring everyone. But that brings up a really important question
4054460	4060140	and that is on different social media platforms, you have a really different tonal way of
4060140	4065020	representing yourself in your life. And Twitter it's, oh, I'm so fucking miserable. You don't
4065020	4070300	have cheap opinions in five days. I don't have a boyfriend send. And then, um, and then on
4070300	4079580	Instagram, following, uh, uh, quest love, Hillary Clinton, um, official, but, um, no. And then on
4079580	4084220	Instagram, it's like, well, isn't that nice? And then on Facebook, it's like, I am so grateful for
4084220	4090780	my family. And so you represent and then Tumblr, it's like, I cannot believe what happened yesterday.
4091580	4098460	But I mean, that's a weird and how dare he in that interview suggest that Jeff and Annie's
4098460	4102060	relationship had something to do with the schoolgirl crush. All right. You're projecting. I'm going
4102060	4105900	to kill myself right now. If no one stops me, you're projecting. And that is a very, that's a
4105900	4111020	limited scope of your experience, but I believe you scroll down to the cat meme. Right now on
4111020	4116620	Twitter, I'm not like the world's biggest tweeter. Uh, I don't know. I do it once in a while. I'm
4116620	4121180	going through a fucking crisis. I have been for a long time. Now I've been confused with Jeff Davis,
4121820	4126140	the creator of criminal minds. And now the television is teen wolf. Oh, dear. There's a
4126140	4133900	guy, a guy that makes shows that has your name. And once I was told by my, uh, my accounts,
4133900	4140860	our accountants, uh, uh, we had the same accountancy people, uh, that, Hey, uh, you BLS limo, you used
4140860	4145260	a limo service for something and it got charged to another Jeff Davis, but we've sorted it out.
4145260	4149820	My credit card was shut off a couple months ago because I, my accountant called me up and said,
4149820	4155180	did you just spend $5,000 on limos last night? Like, no. They go, okay, that's, that's criminal
4155180	4162300	minds. Teen wolf, Jeff Davis. Can you tell BLS limo to get their shit together as I've left them
4162300	4170940	and also BLS, if you let me go, uh, you need a middle name, like Minotaur. My name is Brian
4170940	4175580	because of sag. There's a million Jeff Davis. I am Jeff Brian or Jeff B Davis rather. I'm Jeff B
4175580	4179820	Davis for that reason. Cause there's a long line for Jeff Davis is out there. You need to throw
4179820	4184220	Mohammed in there. You need to do something. You need to go for heart stack, which is not
4184220	4188460	George's last name. It's hard start, but everyone missed it. Allie has a name because of that. Oh,
4188460	4193660	yeah. I, I did, um, search engine optimization on my name and I changed my identity. Hi. Um,
4193660	4199660	my name is Allie Ward, but it was A-L-I and then Ward. And then, um, and then 2011, uh,
4199660	4205980	happened 2011, 2000 and September 11th happened. Hi. I don't know. I already fucking forgot.
4207900	4210380	There's a mnemonic device. If you want to remember 9 11.
4211340	4215580	I have a posted note on my, on my mirror and it's like, don't forget the thing.
4217420	4221820	I know. But after that I would, I would, people would call me Ali all the time and I was like,
4221820	4225180	this is getting confusing. And then I started writing for a newspaper and there was another
4225180	4230540	journalist named Allie Ward spelled with no E and she was a horticulturist in, uh, in Britain. And
4230540	4235660	so people would be like, hi, I'd love for her to ask about tulip bulbs. And I was like, fuck you.
4235660	4240940	And so I put an E on the end. I googled Allie Ward with an E, no one else, zero search results.
4240940	4243900	And I was like, all right, that's my new name. And now my parents, when they write to me,
4243900	4249660	they don't, they, they put the, sometimes it's an E. No, no, they don't know what to call me. And
4249660	4253100	I'm like, hi, I'm the, I'm the chick with the E on the end. You know, when I was younger,
4253100	4257100	I got made fun of for my name, like both the first and last, so fucking much. But now I'm so
4259100	4263980	hard stark in the world. You have the name of a dead woman. It's Georgia Miriam, hard stark,
4263980	4267740	house, hard stark. What the hell? I get a lot of guys come up to me like, do you,
4267740	4273820	do you watch Game of Thrones because your last name is really, what is it? It's like house stark,
4273820	4280940	right? Who's it? We're my nerds at. If you go up my Twitter timeline right now, look,
4280940	4285340	90 fucking percent of it is a bunch of people going like naming characters like, Oh my God,
4285340	4290140	the best thing that ever happened. So-and-so, and then it's everybody replying to everybody,
4290140	4297100	including the official MTV Teen Wolf sites. So before this quite escalated, I say,
4297100	4301020	I wrote a tweet a while back like a couple of weeks ago and said to the people following me
4301020	4304940	that have confused me with Jeff Davis, creator of TV's Teen Wolf. Don't you think it's weird
4304940	4310060	that I've never tweeted about Teen Wolf? And then I said, you know what? Fuck it. I've never
4310060	4318060	seen the show, but I'm going to do a Q and A. I've never seen the show, but I'm not the creator
4318060	4321100	of Teen Wolf. I'm going to do a brief Teen Wolf Q and A. Some people are like, how do you know
4322140	4325660	when a Teen Wolf goes through puberty, hairy your balls? So now I just like stupid shit like that.
4326620	4330460	And what's it going to be called when he's not a teenager anymore? It's just going to be called
4330460	4336460	Wolf. So I did five of those and said, thank you. I hope I answered your Teen Wolf questions.
4336460	4341580	Sincerely, Jeff Davis, creator of Teen Wolf. But also I called the cast a bunch of pricks and I
4341580	4348300	said I had a methadone addiction. So there was some like online news thing. I was like the dots
4348300	4353100	or I don't know what they were talking about. Did some funny article. The wrong Jeff Davis answers
4353100	4359020	your Teen Wolf questions. And they go like, it's comedian Jeff Davis, Jeff Ryan Davis,
4359100	4362780	because apparently this guy, Jeff Davis, had gone offline of Twitter a couple of years ago,
4362780	4367980	probably because he's truly disliked because most of the shit I get at my time, I was like,
4367980	4373260	fuck you, you're Satan. I'm like, hey, whose line shouldn't be taken that seriously?
4374620	4379980	We better get this guy on the show. Please, Jeff Davis. So actually the Teen Wolf people said like,
4379980	4384220	that was hilarious. Thank you. But with all of that, because people that watch the show,
4384220	4391100	God bless them. I'm sure they're lovely people, but I would guess younger and irony, not their
4391100	4399900	fort. So I cast them, not their bag, neither the bread nor their butter. And so now, because of
4399900	4406620	that, I have so many more followers to think I'm the creator of Teen Wolf. And so I've just gone
4406620	4412620	on begging MTV, please set the fucking record straight on this one. My time right now is a
4412620	4418460	fucking absolute morass of people saying things I have no idea what they're talking about.
4418460	4422860	Do you have dueling wikis? Dueling wikis, by the way, name of my autobiography.
4422860	4425340	No, do you have dueling Wikipedia? What the hell was that?
4425900	4426540	Your phone fell out.
4426540	4432620	It's fine. Her bejazzled phone. It was blowing up too much. Oh, don't worry about it. Do you have
4432620	4437180	dueling Wikipedia? I don't know what that is. Like, did you have a Jeff Davis and a giant
4437180	4442540	TV? Oh, my Wikipedia page is so fucking absolutely fallacious. I've tried to change it.
4442540	4449260	I'm not allowed to change it. I'm still dating a person I've never met. I created calcium.
4451820	4459100	I'm the viceroy of Bengal. I won't go to mine because people that hate me,
4460380	4465420	I cross the tipping point. I don't Google myself and I won't Wikipedia myself because I'm afraid.
4465900	4470700	Sometimes there'll just be a paragraph in there that's like, fat asshole Dan Harmon is a fat fuck
4470700	4476700	and a fat piece of shit. If it was just that, it would be great. It's the insinuation that I'm a
4476700	4483260	bad person with bad values. That's what gets under my skin. When I was in my 20s and Google was first
4483260	4489740	a thing and I would Google my own name and there was a little blend of like, oh, I've done some
4489740	4497500	stuff. It's a dim recollection of wishing that I was like, oh, I wish I was because there was
4497500	4505260	another guy who was like a district attorney of Arkansas named Dan Harmon who had participated
4505260	4511100	in the assassination of two kids who were walking down a railroad track and stumbled onto a drug
4511100	4516140	deal between cops and drug dealers. You can assassinate kids? Yeah. Well, if they witness
4516220	4524140	the drug deal between cops and drug dealers and the two kids were just blown away and Dan Harmon
4524140	4529420	was the district attorney, I want to say, or attorney general of the state or something like that.
4529420	4538300	You Google my name. Oh, you're not done. I would Google my name and I would click at the first
4538300	4542700	three results and I would be like, fuck this fucking guy that murdered two kids. One day I'm
4542700	4546620	going to be more famous than him. I would really think that in my head. I'm like, I'm the one day
4546620	4551980	I'm going to fucking Trump this guy for the murder of two children. Be careful what you wish for.
4552940	4559180	Also, a name for a noose in the South is a Jeff Davis necktie. Like there's a famous Jeff Davis
4559180	4565100	out there and he wrote. Yeah. When you Google my name, which I don't do often because it's fucking
4565100	4570140	terrible for yourself, but there's this, like years ago, like three years ago, I wrote for
4570140	4575740	a deal breaker blog, like a deal breaker. If you, um, if you share custody of a pet with your ex,
4575740	4580380	like I won't date, like that's a deal breaker. It's a fucking guy. Like there's now, if you
4580380	4585820	Google my name, it says why Georgia hard Stark will die alone, not literally word for word. And
4585820	4589980	you click on it and it's like just tearing me apart for having that opinion. Clearly a guy that
4589980	4595420	shared a bulldog with her, like a every time people I think will Google me, they'll click it
4595420	4599740	because it's terrifying. And so it stays up on like the top of the Google list. So like my grandma
4599900	4605980	is like 103. If she fucking, she does not give a shit. She's like ever life potion.
4608540	4611900	Hey Dan, can we bring Spencer up? Uh, well we should, uh,
4611900	4614220	we should, uh, we should, we should, we should bring goodbye to our guests.
4616060	4623500	On dead grandma. We have to, but I was saying, if you're welcome to stay as far as I'm concerned,
4623500	4626060	but I think it's time to, uh, to have, I think we're going to bring Aaron up. We're going to
4626140	4631340	bring Spencer up and we're going to play D and D. So I would, I would give our guests the broom,
4631340	4635900	but you've pointed it out now. Sorry. I just assumed they were staying with us.
4635900	4638860	No, we're outie. We'll watch the, we'll watch the D and D from the wings. I still have a magic,
4638860	4644780	the gathering deck in case anyone wants to play. All right. Well, let's thank Allie and Georgia
4644780	4674540	for coming by. I didn't mean to give them the, uh, the, the, the hook.
4674860	4677500	Yeah, man. I was, I was trying to get rid of them and you fucked it up.
4679100	4683420	Or I just put the pedal to the metal. Well, yeah, I guess you forced the issue. That's for sure.
4683420	4685180	Well, let's bring Spencer out shall we? Spencer.
4694300	4701260	Spencer. Hey, you leapt to the stage like a, like a, like a desert breeze. Yeah. I'm all over the
4701260	4706860	place today. How are you doing, man? I don't, I'm, I'm out of sorts. I mean, I don't, everyone who's
4706860	4713180	not listening to the podcast will know I look like shit. Um, I smell like shit. I, I, I woke
4713180	4720300	up bad. I, I, I threatened the life of an old elderly lady today. All right, go with that.
4720300	4725740	Let's go with that. Okay. What was the, uh, what occasion do you threatening the life of an elderly
4725740	4733900	driving on a near, near, near target, uh, labrea. There was this old woman who had the crazed look
4733900	4740540	of a homeless person, but the, but the well, well-dressed ness of, you know, a lady going to church
4740540	4746460	and she was wandering in the street like, like those hobos do when they're going up and down
4746460	4752780	the aisles looking for change. But she was just making the most crave and stare like at people
4752860	4757420	and then like walking towards them if they gave any indication of noticing her existence.
4757420	4763500	And, uh, I slipped up, I slipped up, I, I gave one glance and the next thing I know,
4763500	4767180	she was right at the corner of my car, like right in front of it, like just
4769340	4774460	and, um, and my window was down. I think that might be why she was targeting me. Because,
4774460	4778620	you know, I could hear her potentially, but she didn't say anything. She was just staring at me
4778620	4783420	and then the light turns green. And you'd think it was like, because she was trying to cross the
4783420	4788380	street, but it wasn't, but she started to like go in front of my car, like to make us as if she was
4788380	4793180	like going to walk in front of my car, make an eye contact all this time. Like, like, you know,
4793180	4797660	what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen. What are you planning old lady? But so
4798380	4804460	my, my window was rolled down and so I cut around her and like sped off and I was like,
4804460	4812140	I will end your life. You said that end your life. Yeah. As you, as you drove away,
4812940	4819020	you could have just done it. I know. And I wanted her to know that I could have just plowed
4819020	4824700	straight through her and had a great size. So you drove around her, but said, I chose,
4824700	4831020	I saved you this day, but I will in the future end your life. Yeah. What did that lady say at
4831020	4834460	the drive-thru in that YouTube video, which you couldn't get her chicken McNuggets. You know what
4834460	4839020	I'm talking about? I will achieve my ultimate form. You do not want me to achieve my ultimate
4839020	4846860	form. It's like, it seems like this is now a thing. Like, I mean, because really you said that in a
4846860	4852860	rage. That's what you said. I am ageist. I have a problem with old people. I will end your life.
4852860	4858380	Like not, I will run you over. I will kill you. Fuck off old lady. I said, I said, fuck you under
4858380	4865100	my breath. And then I went into your life. I just feel, it feels like there's a, like, like, like,
4865100	4871180	we're becoming a society of a video game. No, I'd love, I'd love to be able to end the lives of the
4871180	4881740	elderly. I'd love to have the, the, the, the composure to word my outrage like that. I had
4881740	4886380	no idea what she was planning. Like if, okay, if I was trying to get the attention of a motorist,
4887020	4892300	um, you know, I would, I would make eye contact and then maybe gesture at them and maybe mouth a few
4892300	4897900	words, get their attention, you know? And then once they had my attention, I'd maybe sidle up to the
4897900	4904700	side of the car and maybe say anything at all. Or, you know, do, do anything other than walk in front
4904700	4909020	of my car right the second that the light is turning green with, without the intent to cross
4909020	4913820	the street. I don't know. Is it possible she was just kind of like a demented, like, well, that's
4913820	4920060	even worse for me. I want to kill those people too. Wow. Um, I got a lot of problems. Yeah. You're,
4921340	4926460	you're about, uh, I don't know, like 70 years too late for that, man. There was a time. I know.
4928300	4934540	I got to catch up. Let's bring out my betrothed, uh, Erin McGathey.
4943820	4951980	Thanks for coming, Erin. Erin McGathey, everybody here.
4953980	4959660	Wow. Short interview in Georgia. Yeah. I love, I love alley in Georgia. I just remember when we were
4959660	4962780	in that restaurant, we were in the rustic in and I yelled at that guy at the children's store,
4962780	4968060	the podcast where the guy like yelled at us at the end of a lunch for swearing during lunch.
4968060	4971820	And I just blurted it out. I don't know. Because he said, you mean, uh, Tam O'Shanter, right? Yeah.
4971820	4976860	He said, uh, oh yeah, I said rustic. He said, he said, uh, if you guys want to, want to talk like
4976860	4980060	you're at a truck stop, why don't you eat at one? And I just blurted it out. Like, if you were to
4980060	4987580	tell people how to talk, why don't you go back to Germany? I'm saying like, like in my most
4987580	4995740	outraged moments, I am not, uh, not the most articulate. We tell them that's not true. I mean,
4995740	5000940	you, you've been outraged and been overly articulate and decimated people are, are,
5001180	5005740	eviscerated people. Who's the guy that came by in the hat, uh, at that, uh, big foot lodge.
5005740	5009500	And he, we saw him and he had a foot door on and suspenders and he was kind of one of those guys.
5010060	5016460	And, uh, yeah, he was exactly one of them. He might've, he might've known swing dance and, uh,
5016460	5023500	and he, and actually I, I knew him from the old swing dance days. So, uh, so there you have it.
5023500	5029180	But, uh, he was like, oh, I'm so-and-so, I'm so-and-so, and he kind of like pistol winks and,
5029180	5033740	you know, and he moved off and we didn't leave. And we're two hours later, he comes by like,
5033740	5037900	are you guys still in the same booth? And I forget what you said, but it was a fucking goodie.
5037900	5041660	And you're like, I said, well, count your blessings. If it were for people like us that
5041660	5045580	didn't move, you wouldn't, you wouldn't know. You'd lose your stripes, Magellan.
5048060	5051180	But I wasn't mad at him. I just hated him. I wanted him to die.
5052700	5055660	You weren't mad at him. You just wanted him to die. We're not in a fight or flight response.
5055660	5062460	I'm not going to be like, uh, Jonathan Swift. Like I, it's, it's, it's when I'm in a surly mood,
5062460	5067980	like I, if I'm, if I've been drinking and I just want to be left alone and someone comes up to me
5067980	5071980	and does one of those things where they wave their hand in front of your face because you're not
5071980	5077980	making enough eye contact or they say like, like that guy did, like he implied that I should have
5077980	5087180	been moving more. Like I, I, I would gladly watch that guy just like descend on a, on a spike onto
5087180	5095340	a bunch of other spikes. I don't know how torture works, but, but like I just, I just, I had more
5095340	5101420	like murder. Like, like, like, like, I just, like, like, if I'm, if I'm going to surly, surly leave
5101420	5105740	me alone mood. I'm kind of in the mood to get a good session of D and D and you guys down for that?
5105820	5106300	I don't know.
5111420	5115660	It's like the last couple, we didn't get shit done. Oh dear. Well, now we know why.
5115660	5121660	Harmon drop them. Aaron, do you have anything to even, even building up pressure back there in the.
5125020	5133100	I'm doing great. I am enjoying the show so far. I'm a little distracted by our recent wedding
5133100	5139500	planning because we wanted to be special, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, we're not going to talk about it,
5139500	5145580	but, but backstage I was just talking to our friends and, and floating on a happy cloud.
5146220	5150300	So I was listening to the episode. I love Valley in Georgia, which is enjoying their, they're all
5150300	5157820	right. The wedding thing does like it, it, it, it, it's kind of cool to have to like pick seven
5157820	5162620	groomsmen. Like that's like when you're a kid, like picking action figures, like,
5162620	5165740	I don't know. You guys discuss like slumber parties and stuff while you're talking about that.
5165740	5171580	I was thinking about like my bachelorette party and what that means and, and being able to,
5171580	5178060	to pick people for that. And, and like you said, being able to pick a bridesmaids and groomsmen,
5178060	5184060	it's a weird position position for like a, an outcast to be in, but it's great. It's so,
5184140	5190780	it's so fun. But as far as like building up steam, I've just been right in this high, man.
5191340	5195420	Because we went to, we went to our wedding venue yesterday. I'm still, still right in that,
5196540	5199740	right in that high. It's going to be good. It's going to be good. Are we going to be the first
5199740	5204860	people that get married that don't almost get divorced during the planning of the wedding?
5205740	5208940	Are we going to be able to pull this off? I hope so. Is that, is that a life trope? Well,
5208940	5213340	I know. It just seems like everyone I've ever talked to when they're planning their wedding,
5213420	5216140	it seems like. How involved are you going to be in this planning, Dan?
5217260	5223260	So far, 100%. I don't know. I would like to think that everything that I don't care about
5223260	5227740	is stuff that Aaron cares about. Right. Yeah. Have you chosen to be very involved or very not
5227740	5235900	involved? I want it to be a good wedding. I'm not going to baby out. I'm not going to like,
5235900	5239980	I'm not going to go, just tell me where I'm getting married. And then also complain about
5239980	5246780	everything. I have a lot of opinions about weddings. I have gone to a lot of them. And I,
5246780	5252220	so I want to make sure the sound system is fucking whip ass. I don't want to hear a crackle or a
5252220	5258220	fucking hum during those goddamn shitty self written vows. I don't want, I don't want, I don't want,
5258220	5262380	I don't want any of the shit that always bugs the fuck out of me when I go to weddings to bug the
5262380	5265660	fuck out of anybody that goes to my wedding. And so I have a lot of opinions about that.
5265660	5270860	I don't want to jinx it, but so far, if I did, it would go a little something like this.
5271900	5278060	So, I mean, I, I mean, I, I wasn't one of those, uh, little girls who dreamed about her wedding.
5278060	5283900	So now as an adult, I'm getting to dream about it from scratch, but all of my really specific
5284700	5291740	passionate ideas match with dance. And I don't feel you guys will see it's just going to get
5291740	5298300	weird at our wedding. Uh, but like it's all, it's all very specific and like works with,
5298300	5304700	it's the same as your vision. So it's all great. I had a dream about your wedding.
5304700	5311820	You can't go though. You're not invited. When is it? I'm out of town. Uh, I had a
5311820	5317100	dream about your wedding that you had asked me to, to, to MC it, not officiate it, but to be like
5317100	5322860	the MC, like kind of bring people up. And then like Dan, Dan panicked and just went out there and
5322860	5330300	just started roasting everybody. And Dan, Dan just did a big roast and then there was a dolphin
5330300	5335820	playing violin. So you were there at our session with our wedding planner.
5335820	5345100	All right, uh, Spencer, what, uh, have you been enjoying being my assistant?
5345100	5350860	Yeah. I, uh, I feel like I've been slipping lately. I'm not sure, not sure exactly.
5350860	5354780	Cause I don't need an assistant lately. Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. So it's been an easy job.
5354780	5361900	Okay. You should high five yourself. Dan doesn't have a workaholic. Yeah. He doesn't have a house.
5361900	5368860	I will go get one right now. I have a copy. I know. I also need a, uh, I need my key fob
5368860	5373580	for my Prius replaced. Uh-huh. That's, that's the one that you like hold near the door and then it
5373580	5381420	opens. What, what are you an alien? No, you have to push a button. I don't know why I'm so offended
5381420	5388300	by that. Your car doesn't have a smart key access where it opens up. Well, it does. He has to push
5388380	5392540	the button, but if he doesn't have the key fob, it won't work. Right. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's,
5392540	5397980	it's fallen apart. I've, I've, I've dropped it and it's, I need a new one. All right. That's
5397980	5401660	something to work on. Let me read that down. So now you're a good assistant. Spencer, do you have
5401660	5407740	any critiques for Dan as an employer? Uh, you know, no, you're doing a, an amazing job. I think
5407740	5413980	he could stand to gain a few pounds. I like this guy. Yeah. You know what? You're promoted to senior
5413980	5422860	assistant. He just became platinum assistant. Especially we did a role in this D and D. Yeah,
5422860	5434300	sure. Let's say we, uh, how exciting is it to see the Harmon quest, uh, animation, which is really
5434300	5441420	exciting. Um, I'm terrified. I've never, you know, I'm just a fucking guy and now I have this thing.
5441420	5447180	And now there's a cartoon of you is pretty incredible. How do you, how do you feel about
5447180	5453740	that cartoon? I feel good. We are. I, uh, I looked way too fat originally. I was like,
5453740	5460860	I'm not saying I'm skinny. I'm saying I'm tall and fat, not fat. No, I see a difference. There's
5460860	5465740	a lot of weird stature changes. I had to tell you like, tell them you're not that fat. I was
5465740	5470140	like, I made Dan, your character is like an incredibly wrote. He's an orc. Like he's
5470140	5475340	characters like six foot seven. Like, and I was fatter and taller than him and I'm six foot four.
5475340	5482220	So that doesn't make sense. Right. Meanwhile, Olair McGaffey, my animation is sexies. Yeah. Yeah.
5484300	5490540	Way sexier than I'm going to Jessica rabbit. Yeah. And you could note it and be like,
5491100	5495580	this does not look like her at all. But instead it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. In her
5495580	5501020	mind. That's what, that's what it is. It's appropriate. I'm glad you like it. I love it.
5501020	5509820	I didn't want it to be like trivialized. No, I was like, I am torn. I am torn in that way.
5509820	5516620	And I say during the thing I describe myself as very like busty and skinny. It's incredibly
5516620	5522940	insulting for every feminist listening. I'm sure. And I should also my, my dream also great because
5523180	5527980	I'm, I'm, I'm virtualizing myself. I should just disclaim. I didn't actually like say anything.
5527980	5533500	They did a great job on their own. The artists. Thank you for just claiming. Yeah. I didn't want
5533500	5538860	to have people think that was my idea. Well, now that's all we know what this is going to,
5538860	5542460	would this be visible? When's this going to be done? No idea. That's, that's what's so crazy.
5542460	5546860	That's what I never would have expected. Like, because, you know, those people who like wrote
5546860	5552300	a pilot and took it around and then they get it shot and then they have a pilot in, in the works.
5552300	5559820	Like I just fell into that. It's weird. I feel bad for everybody else. I'm going to make sure
5559820	5565740	next week, next week's podcast, we're going to have like a civil rights activist on the last two
5565740	5571020	weeks. We've talked about how I don't understand women and how fat I'm getting and how famous we
5571100	5587260	all are. Just a mental note to myself. Okay. Someone who's desalinizing water off the coast
5587260	5593100	of Africa or something. Just to, just to gain something back that I think we've lost. And that
5593100	5599260	person just by proxy is a civil rights activist. No, I'm just, I'm riffing lists of possibilities.
5600220	5603020	Someone special. Someone humanizing.
5606380	5613900	When we last met, our heroes were down a hole and up a creek hundreds of feet below the earth.
5614460	5620380	After landing in the dust, the group spied an approaching hissing skeleton with orange glowing
5620380	5626780	hands. His name was Linnev the rebel. And he revealed to be, he revealed to the gang that
5626780	5633740	Krista Berg was possessed by dark forces as fates would have it. Linnev was also also happened to
5633740	5640380	reveal a cure to the heroes, the mythical mystical terracotta. Then Krista Berg started shooting
5640380	5645580	lasers all over the place and more rain had to restrain him, deftly crafting crafting a
5645580	5651100	muscling manacle. Then court took off the muzzle to make out with the possessed road, which was a
5651100	5658860	admittedly terrible idea. And in return received a mouthful of vomit. Appetite sated the party
5658860	5665260	departed for Torma Tor, the city of unshackled dead. But who was this mysterious skeleton?
5665260	5669900	And why did he quickly drop his language of hisses within five minutes of meeting him?
5670620	5677500	And why did his hands glow with an orange light? We'll find out next, maybe probably not, I doubt it.
5681100	5691820	How drunk were you last week? I don't, I don't. That's like, that was like the hearing like,
5691820	5696300	this is what you did. That's what you sounded like when I was saying it then too. So you told
5696300	5704380	Trisha she was a racist. Trisha, who's Trisha? Do we need a Krista Berg up here? Are we going to
5704380	5709980	go just to freestyle it with us? Can I be Krista Berg? Yes. All right. Hey, Krista Berg, how are
5709980	5717660	you feeling? Are you still possessed? No, no. I mean, I'm fine. I sense, I sense motive on him.
5717660	5727020	His eyes are glowing with rage. Do we find even untiming? No, no, we're going to leave you. You
5727020	5735500	vomited on my mouth, man. Where do we find this tarragon of virtue? That's a weird thing to ask
5735500	5742060	me. The person who's afflicted by it. Okay. I asked the, I asked the game master because I
5742060	5747500	forgot. Did he say where are the tarragon of virtue lay? No, he said he'd take you to the bone sages.
5748300	5755100	Lenev the rebel speaks up. I'm taking you to the bone sages now. All right. We'll recall. Fantastic.
5755100	5760940	Yeah. Let's, let's go to the bone sages. That sounds good. All right. As you trek through the
5760940	5766780	dusty gray darkness, you're reminded of the hazy monochromatic look of the monochromatic
5766780	5775500	look of the shadow plane. Remember this, remember this fellas? By several dark gray pillars and
5775500	5781500	massive curved bones stab out of the ground like teeth. The old shadow plane. It's funny.
5781500	5784060	It's funny what you come to call home when you've been so far.
5784060	5789900	Ain't that the truth? Never thought I'd miss the shadow play.
5798300	5799900	It's just good to be back in the shadow.
5807340	5812140	So we're walking with a skeleton. I don't know what the fuck. I swear to God. I, like last week,
5812140	5816140	I was just, I just, I don't know what happened. It wasn't, it wasn't a long, it wasn't a long.
5816140	5819500	Lenev, touch on, tell me about the, uh, the bone sages. Who are they?
5819500	5825260	Oh, the bone sages. They, they, they, they see the future. They know stuff. They're like,
5825260	5831500	you know, normal non-bone sages. Why, why is people, dude, advisors, they advise the
5831500	5835020	Magister of Tormad Tor. Are they, are they nearby?
5835020	5840700	They're pretty nearby. We're getting close now, but. Okay, cool. Thank you. I take a quick aside.
5840700	5844380	Who's Lenev? When did we meet her? Is she, I don't know what.
5844380	5848300	It's a, he, or it was a, it was a hissing skeleton that had orange gluing hands that came out.
5848300	5849740	Hissing skeleton, orange gluing hands.
5849740	5852700	Yes. And then he stopped hissing and they started speaking.
5852700	5854300	And, uh, he's here to help us.
5854300	5857740	Yeah. He's, I, look, I was there too, baby. I don't know.
5857740	5859420	Okay. Hey, man.
5862380	5865740	I was just saying that, you know, I'm a skeleton, but I'm not a bad guy,
5865740	5868460	but there's skeletons down here that are bad guys.
5868460	5869340	For sure.
5869340	5874620	How do we know that we can trust you, Lenev? I mean, I haven't eaten your faces.
5874620	5879340	Oh, nor have you tried, in which case you would invoke my fucking rage.
5881180	5884140	Sharpie, sharpie, no, no, no, I just want to make that clear.
5884140	5889580	I've run into too many people on this quest who have implied that they have power over me.
5889580	5895180	Nobody does. I've been stomped by an ice giant and I'm here, motherfucker.
5895180	5899500	You eat my face. You eat it.
5900700	5903660	You were so much more pleasant just five minutes ago.
5905740	5907020	He had a cup of coffee.
5907020	5908220	I'm confused.
5908220	5911020	You're thankful that I'm your friend.
5913180	5914380	Not the other way around.
5914380	5914860	Sharpie.
5915340	5916220	You're lucky.
5916220	5916700	Sharpie.
5916700	5917580	You're lucky.
5918140	5918620	Sharpie.
5918620	5920140	When was luck invoked?
5921660	5922140	Sharpie.
5922140	5923660	I just said I didn't attack you.
5924060	5924540	Sharpie.
5924540	5927740	Just because you don't remember what happened five minutes ago doesn't make it his fault.
5927740	5928220	All right.
5928860	5929260	Lenev.
5929260	5932060	Okay, okay, okay. I take Lenora's side. Can I take Lenora's side?
5932060	5932540	Lenev's.
5932540	5933100	Lenev's.
5933100	5934140	Lenev's.
5934140	5935180	Lenev.
5936220	5937900	Lenev. Listen.
5939900	5941260	Fucking alcoholics.
5941260	5946060	I'm going to tell you something that I don't feel like I could tell other people.
5946060	5946460	No.
5946460	5947420	I'm an alcoholic.
5948060	5953020	And it comes with all kinds of behaviors that...
5955020	5956220	I'm sorry.
5956220	5957820	That's okay.
5957820	5958540	But don't fuck with...
5961980	5964300	Don't assert dominance over me.
5964300	5964780	What is it?
5964780	5965740	What is dominance?
5967420	5971500	You just implied a minute ago that I'm fortunate that you haven't eaten my face.
5971500	5972860	Don't fucking deny it.
5972860	5975660	No, I categorically deny that.
5975660	5977500	He didn't imply that you were lucky.
5977500	5979260	He said, how do I know you were on our side?
5979260	5981820	He goes, because if I weren't, I might eat your face.
5981820	5982220	How many?
5982220	5983660	Well, I just want to correct that.
5983660	5986060	If you weren't, you would try to eat my face.
5987340	5988380	Asterisk.
5988380	5989180	You'd fail.
5990860	5992780	As so many have before.
5994300	5996060	Because I'm a fucking badass.
5996620	5998940	Because this is the game and not real life.
5998940	5999420	Sharpie.
6001820	6004540	Sharpie, let's put this to the test in Tor Mod of Tor.
6005340	6008380	As we go in search of the tarragon of virtue.
6008380	6010460	To save Christoperg from his possession.
6011500	6011820	What?
6013660	6015420	Just nod and go, all right, all right, okay.
6016860	6018860	I was drunk last week and I'm sorry.
6020140	6020540	You know what?
6020540	6021020	I won't lie.
6021020	6022060	I'm a little drunk this week.
6024060	6024560	No.
6025980	6026700	I'm sober.
6027820	6028380	What's your name?
6028380	6029020	Lenore?
6029020	6029580	Lenev.
6029580	6030780	Lenev.
6030780	6031340	Lenev.
6031660	6037980	Okay, just like, let's both be thankful that we're friends.
6039340	6040540	Sharpie, leave it.
6040540	6043020	No one's benefiting.
6043020	6045420	Who's talking about thankfulness or friendship?
6045420	6047660	Are we still walking while this is happening?
6047660	6048940	He didn't.
6048940	6050540	Are we walking while this is happening?
6050540	6052220	Justin Bieber shit, you got all bent out of shape
6052220	6054220	because they went to his house because he ate people.
6054220	6058060	Somebody implies that, like, oh, here's how you know if I wasn't your friend.
6058060	6058700	Your face would be.
6058700	6060300	Hey, how many zombies?
6060300	6062140	How many zombies that have been your friend
6063740	6065660	bit you in the face upon meeting you?
6065660	6065980	None.
6066620	6069340	Yeah, because none of those zombies were your friends.
6070060	6075820	I approached Sharpie and I used my fingers to do, like, the walking up,
6075820	6078380	spider motion up his arm to his shoulder.
6079020	6079980	I slap it away.
6083260	6087980	I'm just saying, I just want to clarify, here's where the culture gap is.
6087980	6088860	I really thought we were...
6088860	6090140	In movies, in movies.
6090140	6091500	I start eating dirt.
6091500	6093740	In movies, when they...
6093740	6094620	You know what else to do.
6094620	6095580	I want to...
6095580	6099660	What is that term for that condition where you want to eat dirt and rocks?
6099660	6100140	Pika.
6100700	6101340	Micah?
6101340	6102060	Pika.
6102060	6102380	Pika.
6102380	6104780	I have pika, so I start eating dirt and rocks.
6104780	6107740	It's a badass thing to say in movies.
6107740	6111580	If somebody goes, like, if I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead.
6111580	6112780	That's how I interpret it.
6113660	6114620	I'm a person.
6116940	6117900	I'm okay.
6117900	6118700	Don't eat dirt.
6119660	6120300	All right, okay.
6122300	6123820	I stop her from eating dirt.
6123820	6125340	Mommy, daddy, in the sand.
6127500	6130780	I walk off with Leneve in the direction of Tormont of Tor.
6130780	6131740	Don't eat dirt.
6131740	6131740	
6131740	6132380	Don't eat dirt.
6132380	6132940	I leave them...
6132940	6135340	I want to get some shit done today.
6135340	6138700	Well, I want to get into some combat.
6138700	6140780	I want to fucking fuck shit.
6140780	6143420	I sing an original song called Don't Eat Dirt.
6143420	6148940	It's awesome.
6148940	6149580	Sing it.
6149580	6150300	Take my word for it.
6150300	6150620	Sing it.
6151820	6155180	Well, it doesn't matter if he rolls, but it's awesome.
6155180	6155660	It's awesome.
6155660	6156940	No, it's all right.
6156940	6159180	You'll sing it, and if I like it, it's awesome.
6159180	6160940	Don't eat dirt.
6163180	6165020	Don't munch gravel.
6166860	6171660	For your hurt can now unravel.
6173820	6178620	If you take my hand in yours, you don't need minerals
6178620	6181020	or oars to go down your gullet.
6182940	6185740	Take that bullet and bite it.
6185740	6188300	Take my hand, don't eat dirt.
6188300	6189820	But I'm afraid.
6192860	6194380	And anyways, it's awesome.
6194380	6196460	No matter what you roll, now you can.
6199020	6199660	So now we...
6201180	6203020	Dan, we just revealed our vows.
6203420	6208540	Hey, Laverne, wait up.
6208540	6209020	Laverne.
6211020	6212300	The face eater.
6215180	6216620	Don't eat my face.
6218140	6222940	I run up to a quirk, and I'm also trying to stay on task.
6222940	6223420	Okay.
6223420	6225100	Just promise me you won't eat my face.
6225100	6226700	He never said he was going to, man.
6226700	6229420	I said I would know if we weren't friends
6229420	6230700	because he would eat my face.
6231260	6232060	That's a threat.
6232060	6233820	He said, did I try to eat your face?
6233820	6235420	He didn't say, did you just your face eat?
6235420	6238300	And he said, how do I know you on our side?
6238300	6239260	Have I tried to eat your face?
6239260	6240620	By the way, why are you on his side?
6240620	6241180	Because he's been...
6241180	6242460	I asked him, are we on your side?
6242460	6244700	He goes, have I tried to eat your face?
6244700	6245500	Do you know?
6245500	6248700	It's a very common, undead activity to eat your face.
6249660	6251340	The very normal among them.
6251340	6252220	Okay, I just...
6252220	6254860	Out of curiosity, like I pull Laverne aside,
6254860	6257420	and I go, okay, Laverne, my trampy's being...
6257420	6259100	He's in one of his episodes right now.
6260380	6261980	Go up there and try to eat his face.
6262140	6262940	I lay down.
6262940	6263980	I lay down.
6263980	6266140	I lay down with my hands under my back.
6266860	6268140	And I go, here's my face.
6271820	6272940	Let's pretend...
6272940	6274140	Hey, fuck your mother.
6275660	6277100	We're not friends.
6277100	6278700	Go through the motions you'd go through.
6278700	6280700	Christoperg vomits acid on your face.
6283260	6283580	What?
6284220	6285980	Christoperg, the possessed rogue.
6287100	6288540	Dealing how much vomit damage?
6288540	6289420	We haven't been tied up.
6289420	6290220	Yeah, still vomit.
6290780	6293740	French speakers, does nev'em mean dream?
6293740	6294620	What does nev'em mean?
6295820	6297500	Oh, nev'em doesn't mean anything?
6297500	6298060	You're drunk.
6301180	6303820	Okay, so there's vomit on my face.
6303820	6305100	Yeah, that's great.
6305100	6306700	Well, why'd you get down on the floor
6306700	6308220	and threaten things to happen to you?
6308220	6310300	To make a point, to assert dominance.
6310300	6311260	Did you make your point?
6312300	6313500	No, you didn't.
6320220	6320860	Okay, fine.
6320860	6323980	I get up, and I follow Laverne.
6323980	6324540	La-nev!
6326620	6327260	La-nev.
6330620	6332460	La-nev, are we close to Tormod?
6332460	6334220	I stopped walking to see all this happen.
6334220	6335420	Yeah, I'm sure we're really close.
6336060	6337980	I'm sure we're right on the precipice of it.
6337980	6339740	Can we compress time and be there?
6339740	6341660	I mean, we could have done that five minutes ago.
6342780	6343580	Let's do it now.
6343580	6344460	We do it now.
6344460	6346300	Okay, but if during any of that time...
6346300	6347580	Jesus Christ!
6350780	6352860	Fine, compression.
6354620	6356620	Hey, I turn to Sharpie and go,
6356620	6358540	Sharpie, look, you're on edge right now,
6358540	6361180	but I say harness that energy, harness that rage,
6361180	6362860	because we might need it for what's coming up.
6362860	6366220	Okay, I don't like people telling me...
6366220	6367500	You didn't say anything.
6368140	6370940	Do you think there are any kids who listen to Hermitown,
6370940	6374860	and they first heard about Dungeons and Dragons
6374860	6379180	or Pathfinder via Hermitown, and they're playing,
6379740	6380940	and then they all tell each other,
6380940	6382540	no, no, you're not drunk enough.
6385500	6387180	And they go into their parents' liquor cabinet,
6387180	6388780	or they start drinking Drano,
6388780	6391500	or it was like, this isn't real yet.
6392140	6393020	You have to play.
6393020	6395260	You have to be blackout drunk to play.
6395900	6397340	There's an explicit label.
6398700	6400780	What if Justin Bieber and his friends were playing D&D,
6400780	6402140	or they started larping,
6402140	6404060	and the eggs were part of it like they had.
6404860	6406700	They were casting spells in their eggs?
6406700	6408620	I guess he's a Justin Bieber.
6408620	6409500	Egg of doom.
6410940	6412940	You know that Justin Bieber's larping is like,
6412940	6414300	I go to the grocery store.
6415900	6417420	I buy fruity pebbles.
6417420	6418220	I go home.
6419900	6420540	The end.
6420540	6421260	Teen Bieber.
6422620	6424300	Teen Bieber.
6425260	6429260	I believe in the Constitution's intact.
6432060	6434060	Teen Bieber.
6434940	6438300	I believe in the Constitution's right
6438300	6440300	to protect you from search and seizure.
6442300	6443500	I couldn't hit the high note.
6443500	6445180	All right, Spencer, keep it going, baby.
6445180	6445740	What?
6445740	6448220	No, Spencer, I attack the ephenophis.
6449980	6450700	You miss.
6451580	6452940	Keep what going?
6453580	6455420	I'm sorry, let's get back on track.
6455420	6455900	I'm sorry.
6455900	6457660	Get back on track?
6457660	6459100	Let's get on track.
6459100	6461260	Okay, now that makes sense.
6461260	6462700	I've been trying, I have been trying.
6463660	6464300	So have I.
6464300	6465580	I'm fucking role playing.
6465580	6467340	When somebody says they're going to eat my face.
6468140	6470300	He didn't say he was going to eat your face.
6470940	6472940	Dude, this is being recorded.
6472940	6475340	Everyone on Reddit is going to agree with me.
6475340	6475820	They're not.
6475820	6477180	No, they're not.
6479340	6483660	The way that that skeleton talked to me was unacceptable.
6484300	6486300	I said, are you friends?
6486300	6486860	And he said-
6486860	6488620	There's a live audience of sober people
6488620	6489900	who heard just what I heard.
6489900	6493580	He said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.
6493580	6494380	No, he did not say that.
6494380	6495420	That's not what he said.
6495980	6496860	That's what he said.
6496860	6500620	No, that's what you heard because you're a fucking paranoid lunatic.
6503500	6506300	He said, if I wasn't your friend, I'd be eating your face.
6506300	6507420	No, he didn't say that.
6507420	6508700	That's not what he said.
6508700	6512540	I've told you four times what he said.
6512540	6513180	What did he say?
6513180	6515100	I said, can we trust you?
6515100	6518060	And he goes, how do we know we can trust you?
6518060	6519660	And he goes, well, have I tried to eat your face?
6519980	6520460	I go, no.
6520460	6521740	This is the same thing like that.
6521740	6523180	Yeah, okay, fine.
6523180	6527100	I don't accept that socially.
6527100	6527660	You're fucking crazy.
6528380	6528780	Crazy person.
6528780	6530300	Hey, man, can you park my car?
6530300	6531740	Oh, sure, I can take you.
6531740	6532620	I'll park your car.
6532620	6535100	Is the valet in undead monstrosity?
6538220	6540380	He's separating himself from the other undead people
6540380	6542140	who would absolutely try to eat your face.
6542140	6543660	Hey, bartender, can I have a drink?
6544940	6547420	Is the bartender in undead monstrosity?
6548220	6550780	Yeah, I'll get you a drink.
6551500	6554540	Hey, you're working this shift, right?
6554540	6556860	Hey, I'm not stabbing you in the throat, am I?
6558700	6559900	Is he wrong?
6559900	6560940	No, you're not.
6560940	6562940	But fucking try, motherfucker.
6562940	6563580	What the fuck?
6563580	6564940	We're in a fight now.
6564940	6566460	You're just trying to stab me.
6566460	6567740	Why are you so defensive?
6567740	6569900	I'm a what the fuck way.
6572860	6574940	You used to talk about gender neutrality.
6575020	6578780	Everybody's on your side.
6578780	6581900	Dan, everybody's on your team right now.
6581900	6582780	Take it easy.
6583660	6584060	Fuck it.
6584060	6585100	Have a sip of water.
6585100	6585580	Fuck it.
6585580	6586060	Take it.
6586060	6587180	Take a couple breaths.
6588140	6589820	Nobody's out to hit you right now.
6589820	6592220	No, no, everybody is because I went to them
6592220	6593020	and they all booed.
6593900	6595820	I don't understand the society where someone
6595820	6597020	could threaten to eat your face.
6597020	6598060	They didn't threaten you.
6598060	6599500	He didn't threaten your face.
6599500	6602220	We're staying here until midnight tonight, by the way.
6603100	6605820	We don't go home.
6607180	6610460	We play D&D until this shit is fucking settled.
6613100	6614140	Do we have live playback?
6615900	6616940	I know what he said.
6616940	6618300	I agree with what you said.
6618300	6619900	He said, fuck it.
6619900	6620460	God damn it.
6620460	6621820	Great idea for a new t-shirt.
6621820	6623340	We don't go home from town.
6623900	6625820	I think you're on an edge about this whole Justin Bieber thing.
6625820	6626780	But that's not the root of it.
6626780	6629180	The root of it is that you feel that the world is closing in on you.
6629180	6631900	Just Spencer's point, because he's an undead maniac,
6631980	6633580	I'm supposed to accept threats from him.
6633580	6634220	But guess what?
6635180	6635980	I'm Sharpie.
6636780	6638460	I've been stomped by giants.
6639100	6641820	I didn't take shit from them, and I don't take shit from anybody.
6641820	6643020	He didn't give you any shit.
6643020	6643980	He gave me shit.
6643980	6647340	He fucking said that he has the freedom to eat my face.
6647340	6648860	You're being a fucking weirdo.
6648860	6649820	You're being a weirdo.
6649820	6651180	So, Nev, Nev, what is our...
6652060	6654700	We're going to meet these other guys, yeah?
6654700	6657180	We're trying to help Christopher get unpossessed, I think.
6657180	6657660	All right.
6658300	6658780	All right.
6659180	6659680	Nev.
6662620	6663180	Forward.
6664220	6667980	And hey, just so you know, I'm happy to be with you right now.
6668780	6669820	Exhibit A.
6669820	6672220	I'm not stabbing you in the face.
6675180	6677100	That's how you know we're friends.
6678700	6679580	Let's hang out.
6681420	6683900	Dan, you're behaving like a monstrosity right now.
6683900	6684700	That's what I am.
6684700	6685500	I guess that's what I am.
6685500	6687100	I guess you should take it as a compliment.
6687180	6689740	Can I summon Coco the horse?
6689740	6690380	Yeah.
6690380	6691500	She's been here.
6691500	6692220	Okay.
6692220	6693420	I hop on top of her.
6694460	6695340	Quirk Sharpie.
6696220	6697820	Would you like to hop on top of my horse?
6698940	6699260	Yes.
6699260	6700540	I hop on the back of the horse.
6700540	6702060	Of course I'd love to hop on your horse.
6702060	6703020	You know how you know.
6703020	6703900	Here we go.
6703900	6705420	Jesus Christ.
6705420	6708380	I'm not cutting a tart out and roasting it over a fire.
6710380	6711500	I'm willing to ride your horse.
6712700	6714060	Socially acceptable exchange.
6715660	6716700	I hop on your horse.
6717660	6719980	He's a giant skeleton with glowing hands.
6720620	6721660	Why do you expect it to be him?
6721660	6724220	We're all on Coco and we're following you at this point.
6724220	6725340	Fucking I'm worried.
6725340	6725900	He's been standing still.
6725900	6727260	I'm worried about Sharpie right now.
6728060	6728780	Yeah.
6728780	6729100	All right.
6729100	6729340	I am too.
6729340	6730860	So it's so advanced, Linhav.
6731660	6731980	No.
6731980	6733340	This is all fucked up now.
6735500	6737420	This guy's being a real dick.
6737420	6738700	I'm just trying to help you.
6739660	6740940	I get off the horse.
6740940	6741820	I get off the horse.
6743500	6744460	I go up to him.
6745100	6745580	She is.
6746780	6747100	What?
6748780	6749420	What do you mean?
6749420	6749660	What?
6750700	6751980	Who's being a real dick?
6752540	6755180	You were threatening to stab me in the face just now.
6755180	6757420	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
6758860	6759420	Interesting.
6764140	6764860	That's weird.
6764860	6766940	Then by the transitive property.
6766940	6767500	Fuck you.
6768780	6769980	Don't eat my face.
6771180	6773020	I will be friends with you.
6773020	6776540	Friends don't throw shit like that out into the air.
6777340	6779020	You don't go to a party.
6779020	6780380	People don't do that.
6782060	6783820	Friends or enemies.
6783820	6786380	Enemies have like détente where they go like,
6786380	6787740	I'm keeping my eye on you.
6787740	6788700	I might eat you's face.
6789340	6792060	Friends are fucking friends.
6792060	6793340	You bony dick.
6794380	6796220	You don't fucking do that shit.
6800940	6802300	He stabs you in the face.
6803020	6803740	He stabs you.
6806620	6807900	Please be a 20.
6807900	6809020	Fucking be a 20.
6809020	6809740	Nope, he doesn't.
6809740	6810540	He doesn't.
6810540	6811500	He lunges at you though.
6812380	6813420	With his glowing hands.
6814220	6815180	Sharpie, he's our friend.
6815740	6817900	I never said anything about being friends.
6817900	6819900	I said, I'd take you to tour my tour.
6819900	6821420	Everyone's being a douchebag to me.
6822860	6825740	I'm reverting to my base or instincts.
6825740	6826700	This is happening.
6826700	6829340	Is he saying all this while he's missing me?
6829340	6830860	Yeah, he has plenty of time.
6831660	6833660	Sharpie, he's going to help us to leave it.
6833660	6834700	I'm going to help him.
6834700	6835500	I'm going to help him.
6837020	6839260	In ways that he would never imagine.
6839260	6841260	This is a totally inappropriate moment for us,
6841260	6843100	but I'm so happy that we're getting married.
6846460	6848380	Christopher's head spins around,
6848380	6851100	vomiting all the way 360 degrees.
6852300	6853820	He's tied up and it doesn't matter.
6853820	6854940	Like a fountain.
6854940	6857100	Okay, I dodge.
6857580	6858940	Obviously, he missed me.
6858940	6859900	He sure did.
6859900	6860940	And I say to him,
6862460	6865100	and I want you to know that I have the skill of...
6867100	6867980	Yeah, I don't really have a thing.
6867980	6868460	Impulse.
6869900	6871020	I say to him, look.
6872620	6873500	Let's not fight.
6875180	6878140	You initiated literally the last 20 minutes of fighting.
6878140	6879500	Let's not wait about who started fighting.
6879500	6881340	That's how fights get perpetuated.
6882380	6884460	What sort of schizophrenic shit?
6887820	6889180	Are you going to stab me in the face?
6890220	6891580	I'm not the one attacking people.
6891580	6892700	Yes, you are.
6892700	6893180	What?
6893180	6894060	This is crazy.
6894060	6895100	I didn't do shit, man.
6895100	6896780	You've been fucking antagonizing everything.
6896780	6899260	I'm not spreading a term explaining to my supposed friend
6899820	6900540	how this fucking...
6900540	6901660	Supposed friend?
6901660	6902220	Yeah, well...
6902220	6903260	I'm trying to keep you alive.
6903260	6904620	Take the skeleton side a couple more times.
6904620	6905740	I'm trying to keep you alive.
6907580	6909100	Fucking weird.
6909100	6910140	Laverne?
6910140	6910620	La-na-na.
6914540	6915820	I'm cool if you're cool.
6916700	6918780	It's La-na!
6920780	6921740	Cliffhanger!
6921740	6922540	What?
6926540	6928940	Thank you for coming to Hermitown, everybody.
6929900	6932300	We almost got something done in D&D.
6936380	6939020	Thank you, Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden,
6939020	6941660	Allie and Georgia, everyone here for coming.
6943980	6945100	I believe in you.
6945500	6947180	I'm Jeff Davis, your cop-troller.
6948380	6949900	Go on the internet and discuss
6950940	6953340	whether that was an appropriate way to respond to someone.
6954540	6957420	I'm your friend because I'm not eating your face.
6957420	6959260	It's not an appropriate way to talk to somebody.
6960060	6960780	It's up to you.
6961420	6972940	Dan Herman, everybody.
