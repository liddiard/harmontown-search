0	19440	Oh, we're going to the Harman Town. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown. In Hollywood,
19440	25760	California, Harman Town is in session. Won't you welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman
25760	43200	Town, Mr. Dan Harman. All right. Happy St. Patrick's Day aftermath, right? You're a little
43200	51000	hungover, Jeff? I got pretty drunk last night. I spent the entire day on the couch overeating
51000	57680	and watching David Attenborough animal documentaries. Aaron and I coincidentally have been watching
57680	63720	a lot of the John Hurt, what's it, Human Planet? That's the one that John Hurt narrates, I think,
63720	71640	in the beginning of the title sequence. He goes, there's only one animal that makes total use of
71640	77240	the whole planet and does whatever it wants. Something like that. That's not really, it's
77240	82640	better written than that. But I always, at the end of it, I compulsively have to go, me, John Hurt.
82640	93800	Just thought I'd share that with you. It's kind of interesting. I thought I knew mostly everything
93800	101240	about why I should be proud of people and being one of them. Because usually you're being told by
101240	105920	the television to be ashamed of being human, and there's a lot of reasons to be ashamed if you want
105920	113880	to dwell on that. For instance, we rape people. We murder each other. We're destroying the whole
113880	120760	thing, whatever. We're doing all kinds of terrible things to ourselves and each other. I always find
120760	128000	it ironic and heroic to try to focus on, yeah, but kind of a cool awkward monkey species that
128880	140240	rose to prominence. There's an underdog story there. A long time ago. No, not really. Not at
140240	145360	all. Not in the time scale that matters. Not if you're telling that story. If you're telling a
145360	153040	story about species, we are in the opening of the third act of the Bad News Bears. We're not even,
153040	166880	it's not. The Bad News Bears are losing that game. I never saw it. We're watching this John Hurt
166880	174880	thing, Human Planet. These guys, I'm assuming it's in Africa. I think that's where lions are.
174880	186080	They get food by waiting for lions to attack an animal, like a gazelle or something, and then
186080	192200	they have this technique, like John Hurt tees it up and goes, they've got an interesting technique,
192200	197200	but first they have to wait for the lion to make its kill. I'm like, okay, what is there going to
197200	202760	be some weird thing, like a fishing pole and then a $20 bill on the end of a line? It's not Vincent
202760	209880	Price narrating that? No, it's not. It's John Hurt. I don't do an impression of either of them,
209880	215400	so I can understand your confusion. These are the guys that just sneak up and just scare the lions
215400	223160	off. No, they don't. Okay, I want to stress that they don't sneak up. The whole thing is they just
223160	233720	roll up. They just walk up like they're going to get a paper, and then part of the gimmick of this
233720	237000	show is all these people that you're visiting around all the corners of the earth, they all
237000	241080	have their own language. You don't know what the hell they're saying. These subtitles, they're
241080	245160	modern subtitles because they float in their keyframes a little bit. They float a little bit.
245960	249880	They float a few pixels to the right as the people are saying them, but the weird thing is
249960	256760	none of the people ... If these subtitles are actual translations, America is the only place
256760	262440	that has any linguistic nuance at all. Everyone everywhere else, if there's a guy climbing a tree
262440	270760	to get to honey, he only ever says, I found bees up here with honey. There's lots of honey in here.
271640	276520	That's what he would say to his friends after 20 years of doing this. He doesn't have any
276520	286280	fucking lingo. We did it again, hot chat. Come on, baby. Yeah, daddy needs a new pair of shoes.
286280	289880	We should be asking ourselves when we see the subtitles, what the fuck's going on? Even though
289880	293000	it's translated into English, it's still like, oh, I get it. He's been doing this for a while,
293000	298440	but everyone just keeps going. There's the lions. Now we make our move, and these guys,
298440	304040	two guys, they just stand up out of the bushes, and there's 20 lions, and they're like, damn,
304040	309400	they have blood on their faces because they're just mushing their faces into dead gazelle and
309400	315160	just eating them. Some of them have manes, and the other ones don't. I think there's some
315160	320440	significance there among them, but the point is like any kind of lion, picture anything. These
320440	325720	aren't scrawny lions. These are like zoo lions. These are big, fat, fucking scary, giant lions,
325720	334680	and like the kind you would get a wax sculpture of out of a machine, and there's 15 of them,
334680	342440	15 of them. What machine dispenses wax lions? That's not a universal thing? No. Oh, okay. Well,
342440	349800	the Milwaukee County Zoo had these machines. I assumed that was a regular thing. I'm sorry.
350520	353880	Go to the Milwaukee County Zoo. The machine makes a wax lion?
354760	359640	They have a machine they used to anyway at the Milwaukee County Zoo. There was a machine,
359640	366200	almost every exhibit almost, like every kind of category. There was a penguin, and there was a
366200	372360	lion, there was a giraffe. If you went there, they kind of dry you in and put a quarter in or a
372360	378920	dollar. I'm sure it inflated, but when I was a kid, it was a machine that would... Really,
378920	382840	none of what I'm about to tell you is going to make a lot of sense to modern ears, but
383480	390200	this was before the internet, and also before I hit puberty. It made sense to me. There was a big
390200	395560	machine, and you put coins in it, and it was kind of transparent what it was doing, and a lot of
395560	399240	tubes and metal things in it. You would put enough coins in it, and it would go...
401800	408040	And these metal things would come together, and then colored wax plastic would go through
408120	424200	these tubes into this thing. And it would drop a hot, dangerous melted plastic lion into a tray
424200	428600	that the machine very specifically told you, a la McDonald's giving you an apple pie.
428600	436280	Like, your fault. If somebody in the front row gave me a picture of one, yeah, that he googled.
436920	442840	Try to enjoy the show. Stop googling. So it's an injection molding machine that makes you a
442840	451800	liner? Yeah, it's a hot plastic injection, as Judd Nelson would say. Do you want to get a hot
451800	457160	plastic injection later on? Did he give you the hot plastic injection? Leave me alone!
457160	467960	See, this is what you get when you spill paint in the garage. Your dad molds a plastic giraffe on
467960	473480	you. It very specifically tells you how you're allowed to hold it, because there's holes in the
473480	478600	bottom of it, and that's where the plastic goes. That's the umbilical point for the mother plastic
478600	484760	machine. And if you hold it the wrong way, ostensibly melting molten plastic would drip
484760	493400	on your child hands, rendering them forever claw-like. You would become like this weird,
493400	500040	like self-loathing phantom of the zoo, feeding goats out of your weird, useless flipper.
500840	506520	Come here, come here. I'm here because I have to be. I once came because I loved it. Now I have
506520	512520	nowhere else to go. No woman will touch me in the parking lot. I've turned into Peter Lorre.
513400	522120	I took on a weird accent that can't be traced. It can't be traced! Rick! Steepy! Steepy! Steepy,
522120	529560	where am I from, Steepy? Um, anyways, tonight's gonna be a tangent free night. I don't want to
529560	536440	get off on anything. Tonight's show is called Focus. So, when I tell you there were 20 lions
537320	543640	burrowing their faces into those kilos, because I used that handy reference to that plastic molding
543640	552840	machine, you guys know exactly what I mean by 20 lions. I had completely forgotten what you were
552840	560840	talking about. But imagine this, too. Here's the thing about lions in the wild. You know, they're
561800	570280	kind of getting no pun intended. I guess pun intended, but also not... No pun celebrated.
570280	578200	They're getting catty with each other, you know? They're eating the gazelle. I said not celebrated,
578200	585560	lady. I couldn't have put a bigger disclaimer on it. I connected the dots. I proceeded as usual.
585560	589320	I did everything I needed to do. I got in the airlock. I took a deep breath. I told everyone
589320	598200	what was happening. I said catty. Some lady... It's a pun. I know. It's an accident. Fuck it.
598200	604280	You know? Like, I'm not gonna censor myself. So, these lions, like, they're eating, and they're
604280	610520	in a mode, you know? Like, they're at a point in their day and their lives where even another lion
610520	617480	is pissing them off. They're like, hmm, this is good, you know, femur muscle. And I know someone's
617480	621800	like, is the muscle good? You want to try some of the spleen? And it's like, I know you're just
621800	625320	saying that because you're gonna want the femur muscle, you know? Like, I don't know. I don't
625320	628680	want the spleen. If I wanted the spleen, I wouldn't have started eating the femur muscle.
628680	634680	You know what I mean? Yeah. Is that only my pet peeve? Like, when you go to eat with your
634680	641720	girlfriend, and she's like, how is the duck? And you're like, the duck's fine. And just in my head,
641720	648840	I just see the chess game, like, yeah, you want to try the duck. And then you don't bite on it
648840	655080	because you come from a family of four people that guarded their food. So then they go, mmm,
655080	659560	god, this chicken. Oh, you want to try some of the chicken? No, I don't want to try the chicken.
659560	667640	I know it's a fucking setup. You want to get into a food exchange where the net result is you get my
667640	675480	duck, but I ordered right. I win dinner. So when you take your losses, eat your chicken.
676360	682040	When you watch a documentary about lions over a carcass, you connect the dots to you having dinner
682040	687000	with your girlfriend? No, I just connected those dots now. I'm just, what I'm telling you is that
687000	693480	well, in order to explain to you what the state of affairs of these lions raising over this gazelle,
693480	699960	like, they're not being polite. They're not lulled into a state of graciousness. These are
699960	705960	lions at the height of their lionness. They're like so mad that another lion could, but they're like
705960	714920	going, you know, I'm eating, I'm eating. So into that fray marches these two fucking idiots
715480	721560	with like blankets for shirts. They got nothing. They don't have like special lion guns or
722040	727080	like rocks that they know make a lion choke. They have like sticks and what they have is eye
727080	733240	contact and they just start walking up. Just a gate, just a g-a-i-t gate. Like they just stand up
733240	737640	from the bush and they just go like, they don't make a set. They don't go like, hey lion, lion,
737640	745000	lion, lion. They don't go nothing like that. They just, they just silently walk up like,
745000	749000	well, they used to carry a g-a-t-e gate and just make it seem like they were separated.
749080	752200	They just slowly pretend like they live there. Oh, another piece of junk mail.
753240	754680	Hey, what are you guys doing in my front yard?
758200	760760	They slowly change their address by one digit.
762280	767560	Uh, no, they walk and the fucking 15 lions, they bone out. They all go like,
768920	772760	these guys mean business. And these guys like quickly carve off. And then John Hurt goes like,
772760	777800	they have to work quickly because, uh, you know, the lions will catch on to their bluff. They
779160	784440	lions will catch on to their bluff. Hey, wait a minute. Those are, those are upright walking
784440	789720	priming. You, you know, more food that just stole our food. You know, you know that you're hungry
789720	794200	when you're chasing lions off a kill. Like you have to be starving. And then, and then they,
794200	797960	they slink it over their shoulder. Like they're, like they're walking out of a deli, like a bad
797960	804600	deli. Cause a good deli would give you a bag, but this is Africa. Like they just went Christmas
804600	810440	tree shopping. Yeah. And they don't run off. They just cruise out. Just walk away, just walk away.
811560	816680	And then they go around to campfire and then the subtitles say like, we got lucky with those
816680	823000	lions today. They didn't know they could have eaten us. Yeah. Uh, that could have gone totally
823000	828120	bad. They'll do it again next Wednesday. I'm just, I'm very impressed with, with, with,
828120	833640	with human beings. Then there's another one where, uh, there's like these, these, uh, uh,
833720	837880	God damn it. What is it? It's a, uh, hey, Aaron, what is it with the,
837880	841240	was it pigeons or something in the, uh, in the trees? What's the thing in, in,
842840	847080	there's those birds that, uh, they, I don't want to spoil the ending. You know what I'm talking
847080	852440	about? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. There's like these locust like birds that are basically like the
853080	857800	avian equivalent of locusts and they like eat everything. So again, it's just these guys that
857800	862600	just hang out and they're like, but now these are birds that'll eat their crops. So like,
862600	867160	but the humans have developed a different solution, uh, to, to their bird problem. At
867160	872120	the end of the night, the birds must, must go home to their nests where the humans have prepared
872120	879960	a rather, uh, clever, uh, trick. They just show them like, like unspooling what looks like cable.
879960	883960	I'm like, wait, this isn't that they're not spearing dung on their heads and like, like,
883960	889160	this isn't a symbiotic relationship. Those look like canisters of gasoline and then they just show
889240	893800	like A teaming, like he's bringing these cheese. And then it's like a joke. It's like a British
893800	898200	sitcom or something. Like the birds all fly to their nests and then it cuts to a wide shot.
900280	904680	Then the entire forest explodes. And then they move on to the next subject.
906040	911720	On the shores of Scotland, humans love to ride segues. Um, it doesn't, there's no,
911720	915720	he doesn't, he doesn't comment on it. It's nothing like human beings. Ah,
916200	920440	ah, that plucky species don't just blow. These birds are getting out of hand. It just blew up
920440	927080	the forest. Uh, they'll have to do it again next Wednesday. Uh, very interesting species. And I
927080	931320	don't say, I think it's important to embrace it and say, you know what? You're all right, humanity.
931320	936120	You're, you're all right. Um, if you could be another animal, like in terms of like,
936120	942040	I would kill myself. I would be a suicidal porpoise. I would purposely go out of my way
942040	949640	to find the places where people dispose of those six pack rings, um, and not cut them
949640	954200	responsibly so I could hang myself. Could you have a choice? Are you a predator,
954200	960040	a scavenger, a victim, herbivore, carnivore? I would, I mean, can I be an auto-trope? Can I
960040	967640	be a photosynthetic, uh, kind of just like mushroom? No, animal, animal. No, it could be
967640	974280	insect, bird. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Uh, I think I would, boy. Oh boy. I mean, there's,
974280	977320	there's hundreds of species in the world. You know, it seems like they got it right.
979080	985880	20 of them undiscovered. Manatees, manatees, they cruise around, they graze on grass, and
985880	989560	nobody eats them because they're too big and fat and no one fucks with the manatee. They just like
989560	993000	can cruise around. Yeah. Well, there is stuff like that, like at the top of the food chain. That's
993000	996600	nice. But they're herbivores. They're vegetarians and nobody eats them because they're, they're
996600	1003640	giant fat people. Yeah. And they, why are you raising your hand, Jesus? Yes. You got one?
1003640	1008120	I just put a column of manatees that get hit by propellers. Yeah. They get hit by propellers. Oh,
1008120	1015560	yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's true. I mean, I think, I think the assumption is that you wouldn't
1015560	1019720	have a manatee brain, right? You would, you would be like, you would be like Albert Brooks as a
1019720	1026840	manatee going like, oh boy, this is, I'm neurotic about this. Like, I would assume that you'd see
1026840	1030600	a propeller and go, I don't want none of that. I wouldn't choose to be a neurotic manatee. I would
1030600	1037160	choose, I'd be Alec Baldwin as a manatee. You'd have a voiceover. You'd have a celebrity voiceover
1037160	1041880	and an intelligent manatee that had like a kind of a dialogue with the audience. You'd be like,
1041880	1046920	I'd be a Bruce Willis manatee. I'd be like, you know, all things considered, I'd rather be at
1046920	1056360	Philadelphia. And those estuaries. Yeah. Oh boy, look, a propeller for me. Fool me twice.
1061400	1063400	Come to Miami, hang out in the channel.
1063400	1074360	Uh, I would be, I would, I would be, or you could be a Liam Neeson manatee.
1075800	1076840	I wonder what that is.
1077880	1082120	Sorry, I didn't mean to set myself up with one of my well-known impressions.
1082120	1086440	All right. Wait. Okay. Let me get out my phone. Let's start, let's start bringing people up.
1086440	1096440	Um, um, I, oh, uh, I want to, you know what, uh, quick, um, listen to Duncan Trussell's podcast.
1096440	1101640	It's like, like, I, I like, I like to think that, uh, most of our audience is kind of overlapping
1101640	1105400	because I think if you, if you like the meal you get here, it's, it's pretty tasty over there as
1105400	1111080	well. And vice versa. But, um, uh, but I mean, right. If you, if you haven't jumped aboard
1111080	1116280	like right now, like I feel like this is hyperbolic. I don't, I don't like a big podcast guy,
1116280	1120920	but I feel like he must be making podcast history. Uh, uh, that there's something that
1121720	1126680	his mom is dying. Uh, he just recovered from testicular cancer, which is completely unrelated
1126680	1132840	to him. And his mom, his mom is succumbing to breast cancer, I believe. And, and, and, but it's
1132840	1138120	like, I, it's just incredible. Like I, I, I had to pull my car over to the side of the road
1138120	1143320	when he was just talking about it. He's in, I think he's in North Carolina, uh, uh, uh, you know,
1143320	1147400	getting her affairs in order and talking to her and stuff. And then that was, it was already
1147400	1151320	enough just him talking about it. It was mind blowing the way that this guy is able to cope with,
1151320	1156760	uh, the thing, the fundamental things that cause us suffering. Um, and that the big giant cosmic
1156760	1161720	elephants in the cosmic room, like he's, it's not like he's a man, he's not Caesar maligning them,
1161720	1166360	but he, he, he is able to like, he, you're not supposed to, he knows that you're not supposed
1166360	1170040	to. And he's just like, I don't know the Alon with which he talks about this stuff. And then,
1170040	1174840	and then on top of all that, just the most recently, now the most recent episode is
1174840	1180360	these, it's his mom. He's interviewing his mom literally on her deathbed. There is no
1180360	1184360	skirting around it. They're not, nor are they joking about it hilariously.
1184360	1190280	It's not depressing. It's not, it's not fake uplifting. It's just honest and sincere and
1190280	1195240	incredible. And, and there must be some kind of, uh, uh, because this is how I process things.
1195320	1201640	There must be some kind of potty award. Oh, you mean like podcast, not potty. Like you take a
1201640	1206280	poop when you're a baby. I want to reduce everything to give him an award. That was great.
1209720	1215080	That was a joke, but I guess you guys believe that I'm that petty potty, which makes it sound
1215080	1218680	like poopy. Oh, no, no, I don't think, no, they still, they still, no, they understand what I'm
1218680	1223320	saying. They refuse to laugh at my joke because they're like, Dan, a woman's dying. And I'm like,
1223320	1228120	yeah, but I have a joke that I'm doing. And they're like, yeah, we get it. It doesn't,
1228120	1232760	you're not entitled to a laugh from us. We visited a friend of ours that was in a hospital
1232760	1236360	for maybe trumped up reasons and nothing was wrong with him. But you, you were very ill at ease in
1236360	1241160	there. We were in their ER with our friend. I don't like hospitals for sure. Yeah. I mean,
1241160	1247080	I mean, nobody does, but you were, uh, you looked really like, like, uh, really freaked out. Well,
1247080	1252840	I mean, here's the thing. I don't make a lot of eye contact in general. Uh, uh, an emergency room
1252840	1257800	is a three foot, like closet. So if you're not making eye contact in an emergency room,
1257800	1262360	it's like, you don't really have, it's kind of like, you can either stare at your friend in an
1262360	1266280	emergency room bed or you can do what you did, which is you showed up for five minutes and then
1266280	1270840	you went, I'm bored and you left, which is fine. Uh, I also said, do you validate, which is how that
1270840	1277800	hilarious. No, we all did lots of bits and we had a great time. Nobody might be dying. Like Dino,
1277800	1280760	I'm going to, I'm going to use that forever. Now, every time I go over to somebody, I'm going to
1281240	1285720	leave, uh, the validate. We all took pictures and did bits about the environment stuff, but yeah,
1285720	1290360	I mean, like, like sure. I'm, I'll, I'll own the fact that I don't, I don't like my friends in
1290360	1294440	hospitals and I don't like strangers in hospitals. I don't like hospitals. I get this, people that
1294440	1297880	get like lightheaded and there's people that get sick to their stomach. I got more of this stomach
1297880	1302440	kind. I get, I get a little queasy and I want to see people hurt. I thought he wasn't, he was fine,
1302440	1306120	but like I've, I've gone and visited friends that were like, you know, had been in car accidents and
1306200	1313480	stuff and I get really like, like I want to puke. All right. No, I, I, I, maybe I went,
1313480	1319880	maybe I went to him sort of puking award. He, he, he, he, he had, he had, you know what,
1319880	1328440	let me do what they didn't do. Uh, you know, there's basic human rights people have as
1328440	1331960	performers. You know, they're, if you, if you, if they go like this, for instance,
1331960	1334920	where they bounce on their toes, like Johnny Carson at the end of something, you could give
1334920	1339080	them a chuckle, even if you don't think it's funny. I didn't know whether to, whether to marry
1339080	1346040	it or drive it. And then you kind of do that. Thank you. Was that so hard? Jesus Christ. It's
1346040	1354040	not, you know, I'm not running for office. Uh, just, just doing a show. Uh, it's all,
1354040	1359400	it's all a joke. I don't know what I'm saying ever. Um, but I do know what I'm watching
1360200	1367160	and sometimes what I'm watching are horror movies. And last, last week we, we, he wasn't here,
1367160	1371480	but he's here this week and it's, he actually, it turns out he's, he's, he's currently in the
1371480	1376040	process of retiring his horror movie a day, uh, blog. And we've, now it's more, actually more
1376040	1382040	timely to bring him up. So God smiled upon us, uh, booking wise. Um, so can we bring to the stage,
1382040	1393160	Brian W. Collins. Is he here? Is he here? Maybe he's not here again. Oh, he's here. Okay. Here he is.
1395640	1403640	Brian's, uh, here, you can grab one of those. Hello, Brian. Hello. Yeah. We can sit down
1403640	1409480	like this. Um, so you're, you're a long time Armenian. I mean, you, as far as I know, you've
1409480	1413480	been here since, since long before we even started podcasting, but I don't know or care,
1413480	1418760	but, uh, I mean, we've talked to you often and, and, and know you as a, as a friend and that you
1418760	1425080	have this blog, which I have never visited, but that I find endlessly fascinating, which is sure
1425080	1428600	by our symptom of narcissism. Like, well, you're like, Oh, my friend does this really interesting
1428600	1433240	thing. And I'm just like, still though, I'm going to read this tumbler entry about myself one more
1433240	1439480	time. And it's, and it's no wonder my brain is decaying. Like, like, it's like eating, eating
1439480	1446600	the lead paint of my own ego. And of course I'm going to die of something. Um, uh, Brian, uh,
1446600	1452200	tell us, tell us about your blog in a nutshell and know that I'm a bad interviewer. All right.
1452200	1458520	So, uh, yeah. Um, just a little over six years ago, I started watching horror movies every day
1458600	1463400	and a couple of weeks into it, uh, I just decided to start writing reviews as well.
1464440	1471720	Does it, that does it. Thank you. And, uh, you know, I, I, I started being like an editor. I
1471720	1476440	never really wrote much. Um, so it is kind of figuring out how to write reviews every day.
1476440	1481480	So you watch a horror movie every day for six years. Yeah. So what's six times 365?
1481480	1489640	Anybody good at math? Is that right? Well, there are days where I watch more, you know,
1489640	1493880	I go to festivals and there's like four or something. So the 2,500 is the mark that I'm
1493880	1500920	stopping at, which is, uh, March 31st. So first question is, how does that start? Like, like,
1500920	1506120	like, like, like, at one point you noticed, you realized you were on a streak of watching one a
1506120	1511000	day. Basically what happened was that I had rented, you know, the disc from Netflix that all happened
1511000	1515960	to be horror. And, uh, they were sitting on my, like my couch for four months. And I was like,
1515960	1519480	looking, I'm like, wait, I could have just bought these three movies by now. There's a lot,
1519480	1523240	there's 2007, they didn't have Netflix. What do you mean you bought them as opposed to what? As
1523240	1526920	opposed to paying for Netflix for three months for nothing. Cause this is before instant. So it's
1526920	1531080	just the discs. Oh, okay. So I was like, all right, four times, whatever three, you know,
1531080	1534520	Netflix. And I'm like, I could have just bought these. Um, like, you know, and then I just start
1534520	1538040	thinking about my day. I'm like, all right, you sleep for eight hours. You work for eight hours.
1538040	1541400	I'd say eight hours of the day. I'm doing something. Why can't I just watch a horror movie?
1541400	1549560	Right. Um, so now were you single at the time? No, actually the only time I ever
1549560	1554840	missed a day was like a week after I started, uh, my wife and I took like a, uh, it was our
1554840	1561080	five year anniversary of dating and we went down to, uh, to Long Beach for like a four day weekend.
1561080	1564760	And I missed one day then the other three days. I still watch star movies,
1564840	1570120	but so you've not missed, you've only missed one day in six years. Yeah. Wow. And, uh,
1570920	1574280	that's why I've been in come last week. Cause I was actually, I didn't watch the movie yet.
1574280	1579080	So really, yeah. So I got out of work and I was like, is it worth it? Do you still enjoy it?
1579080	1583240	Yeah, no, it's, it's part of the day now. So, I mean, I don't, it's not hard to like,
1583240	1587960	I mean, every now and then things get busy, but, uh, so we can assume you've seen leprechaun
1587960	1595320	on the hood. Well, let's talk about that in a second. Uh, leprechaun the hood up to no good.
1596120	1601800	How did you know? Good. Uh, the, um, uh, so what, what, what do you think it is about the genre?
1601800	1606360	Is it, is it like cheesecake? Is it like, like, like, like, is it a comfort food,
1606360	1613000	like the genre of horror as opposed to sci-fi fantasy as opposed to, uh, Tom Cruise thriller?
1613240	1617640	Uh, is it, is it, is it, what, what is, is there a factor you must have thought about this
1617640	1624680	sometime in six years? Well, Tom Cruise Thriller day sucked. I mean, no, I've left horror since
1624680	1628920	I was a little kid. Um, you know, it wasn't like I just started watching her that day. Like I,
1628920	1633240	you know, I've always been into it since I was like six or seven. So why, why do we like horror
1633240	1638440	movies? Uh, I think for me, I just found them, they're more creative because I, you know, I always
1638440	1643480	had friends that were into like doing special effects makeup, um, and, you know, editing and
1643480	1647880	stuff like that. So to me, like you can really get away with more when you're doing horror as
1647880	1652040	opposed to like, like romantic comedies where you kind of have to fit that formula. Did they
1652040	1656440	scare you? Are there any, not since I was a kid. No. So there's not one that still gets you,
1656440	1660440	gives you nightmares or anything like that. No, I mean, those, I watched, uh, I rewatched
1660440	1664040	like two years ago that this TV movie that I saw when I was a kid called don't go to sleep.
1664040	1669320	Does anybody know that one? No, it was a TV horror back like when they did made for TV
1669320	1674120	movies every week. Uh, it's about a little girl that gets possessed by the spirit of her older
1674120	1678680	sister who had died in a car accident and she blames the family. So she systematically wipes
1678680	1683320	out the family. And there's this bit where like she's possessed and she has a pizza cutter and
1683320	1687080	she's just like going up the stairs with this pizza cutter. And like she goes upstairs and kills
1687080	1690280	her dad with it. And like that freaked the shit out of me. I was like six or seven. There's
1690360	1695640	always some image afraid of pizza cutters. Oh yeah. Like if I open the kitchen drawer,
1695640	1699800	I see when I get scared. It's funny that you would bring up romantic comedies as the obvious
1699800	1704600	antithesis to the horror, which I think is accurate because sex, which is the ultimate
1704600	1708440	creative act, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're pro creating, you're creating life
1708440	1713080	and death, which is, you know, I don't know if it finishes thought like this is,
1713080	1717320	this is the battery that charges a human life. Like, like, like, like we're avoiding,
1717320	1722120	we're afraid we're all going to die. We know that we're going to die. And we're also like driven to
1722120	1727080	like make a life and live life. And, and so, and there probably is an equal volume of,
1727800	1732520	actually, I bet horrors got it, got it, got it like doubled or tripled. But, but like,
1732520	1737880	you could watch a rom-com a day, you could try, like, and you wouldn't necessarily end up having
1737880	1743240	a loop back on yourself. I think they might make one a day. The, the, the big question is,
1743240	1748280	why isn't that like a visceral, like, like thing? And I think the answer has to do with the
1748280	1753960	honesty level of a, of a, of a society that's like high on the hog. I think that, I think in a post
1753960	1760280	Spielbergian box office world, you're, you, you're just not allowed to be as creative with love as
1760280	1766280	you are with death. I think that we have decided that death, because we elude it daily and, and
1766280	1770680	have kind of compartmentalized it, we can actually, you can put, have Clint Howard in your movie and,
1770680	1774600	and have him stab someone in the head with an ice cream cone and, you know, like, like, and go,
1774600	1778920	and go like, ah, what a fun way to kill that person. And here's a new way to make brains look real.
1778920	1783880	And we're constantly experimenting with death and encouraged to do so because we've cartoonified
1783880	1789320	death, because we don't actually, we've turned funeral parlors into, you know, the parlors of
1789320	1795400	our homes into, into living rooms and, and, and, and put funeral parlors down the street and like
1795400	1799400	made dead bodies, things that you bear, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, ranting about that. But we've,
1799400	1804840	we've compartmentalized death in Western society. And so like, movies are like, hey, fun. It's like,
1804840	1810840	whoa, imagine if his guts are flying out. Romance, however, is like, it's on these rails. It's like,
1810840	1816040	like, like, like, okay, like, this guy's a bad guy because he's, you know, you can't, you can't do a
1816040	1823240	million fun, creative things with your dick and a vagina. That's pornography. Like, that's not, it's,
1823880	1830280	like, horror is still, it's not considered pornography, but it's like, it's equally
1830280	1836840	voluminous and also dealing with the primary colors of, of, of what we deal with. Like,
1836840	1845400	we're all scared of monsters and dying and stuff. Thank you. I win, I win the contest with myself to
1845400	1849640	see if I can explain why horror movies are good. And they're not good. That's the other thing I
1849640	1854600	wanted to ask you. You must know more than anyone how many of them are bad, because for the reasons
1854600	1860600	I'm describing any, like a lot, like it actually, like more hacks are probably attracted to the bug
1860600	1866120	lamp that is the horror genre. Well, that's, I mean, that's the thing is that, you know, unfortunately,
1866120	1870680	not only there are a lot of bad movies, there are, you know, no offense, bad fans, and that they're
1870680	1875480	like, you know, you guys were talking about last week, the guys that like think Sharktopus and these
1875480	1879640	sci-fi movies, they're funny. So you can make pretty much anything. And not only will people
1879640	1884680	watch it, but it's easy to sell because, you know, most horror movies are independent. And it's like,
1884680	1889320	oh, you killed three people in it. Cool. We can put that on the cover and, you know, sell it in
1889320	1893560	Germany and sell it over here. You know, romantic comedies, all these other things, you know, that
1893560	1897800	they're more star driven. You can't like make like a low budget rom-com and instantly get that
1897800	1901960	right sale when you go to like one of these film markets. So yeah, I'll never run out of horror
1901960	1905560	movies if I wasn't quitting because there's always going to be hacks that are like, eh,
1905560	1909320	$10,000. Look at, they do paranormal activity. You know, we have a video camera in a house.
1909320	1914520	And so you have to sit and watch like the most horrible ones of all, which you can browse through
1914520	1918440	on Apple TV. And thank God for the preview feature where you can see from the trailer,
1918440	1923320	oh, Jesus, they didn't even mix their sound. Like, like, it's just like a rat, like flies on a
1923320	1927080	tour. When you're done with this, when you watch 2500, are you going to be happy to not have to
1927080	1930200	watch these anymore? Are you still going to continue to watch horror? No, I mean, I'll still
1930200	1934520	do stuff. You know, I work for a couple of different websites now. And like, I actually
1934520	1939720	might be working for Netflix as like a horror expert of some sort. If anybody is, it's got to
1939720	1945400	be you now. Holy fuck. So, you know, so I'll still be watching. It's just like, and the site
1945400	1948840	will still be there too. And I'll update it when I feel like it, but I just won't like wake up and
1948840	1953240	be like, all right, I got to find time to watch like some Children of the Corn sequel or something.
1953240	1957320	Like, you know, or if I start watching a movie and it's terrible, I'll be like a normal human
1957320	1962440	being like you guys and shut it the fuck off. Now what's your stance on the leprechaun of
1962440	1967880	franchise? I like the first one when I was 13. Right. I think I watched one other I watched one
1967880	1974360	of the he's gone to the hood twice. Yeah. Well, that's it's an interesting thing to look at in
1974360	1979640	terms of sequelogy. Like if there's a term paper you could write because let everyone kind of
1979640	1985800	widely will say as a knee jerk response, if you bring up the leprechaun franchise, that leprechaun,
1985800	1991560	I think it was three in the hood into hood. No, no. So three was Vegas, I think, or two.
1991560	1995960	Four was in space and then five and six of the hood. Oh, five. Oh, really? Yeah. Wait,
1995960	2000520	the two hoods were in a row. Are you sure about that? Okay. Okay. And it's not as interesting
2000520	2005880	as I thought. He goes to space. Yeah. He went to space. He went to space. And then he comes
2005880	2010200	back and goes to the hood twice. But it was, it was better when he was in the hood. The reason
2010200	2013960	why it was better when it was in the hood, you could, you could tell watching the first one,
2013960	2018520	like, like, like, like that it was like, it felt like it was written by white screenwriters. I
2018520	2022280	don't know if any of this is true. Like everyone correct me. This is what it felt like. I'm not,
2022280	2027080	I'm not a journalist here. It felt, I kept picturing like two white screenwriters going like,
2027080	2034200	you know, let's write a movie for the black people that want to like, let's put the people in the
2034200	2039160	theater that are always yelling that crazy stuff. Let's put them in the movie and have them yell the
2039160	2044360	stuff at the leprechaun. That's what it felt like. They were, it was sort of like this weird,
2044360	2049720	like, like half love, half hate, like half a racist, half like, like, like, I had a cultural,
2049720	2055000	like emboldening, like thing. It was, that's what it felt like. I hope to hear it was written by a
2055000	2058840	wonderful black screenwriter who was, who was just working organically and not from a weird
2060040	2066040	entomology perspective by some guy going, what would they like here? I think ICE-T should say
2066040	2070920	what we're all thinking when we see the leprechaun as black America, which is you ugly motherfucker,
2071960	2077160	and then pop a cap in them. Try to pop a cap in them. Show them that the cap popping doesn't work.
2077160	2082920	Show them why. They want to know. We asked them after the first two movies, why wouldn't they pop
2082920	2088680	a cap? You know, and, and let's show them, let's show them pop a cap and then have the caps pop
2088680	2093400	right back out. And then now you're invested. And I kind of, I kind of agree with that philosophy.
2094120	2100040	I'm giving him a weird, like, like, like nasal dialect, but, but that might be me. That might be
2100040	2105480	how I would approach writing a leprechaun movie. Anyways, here's, here's my observation that I would
2105480	2110520	like to make about the leprechaun franchise. Here's the thing. We watched like three of them
2110520	2118280	for St. Patrick's Day. Leprechaun, that's his name. Definitely like watch these movies again
2118280	2125720	and like watch a man, like, like he's, he's, he, he very, very many times under a variety of
2125720	2135640	circumstances, ends up pretending to be a woman to get a man horny and then killing him. Like,
2135640	2141000	like right as the guy is like about to climax. He never does the other thing. He never,
2141000	2144600	like if you want, if he wants to just kill someone, he can just rip their finger off or
2144600	2149160	like he he'll just go like, let me give you a leg up and then it'll just rip your leg off.
2149960	2154840	So it's like weird that he sometimes then he'll crouch behind a crate or a bed and he'll just
2154840	2160840	like a guy, I'll be taking out the male and then, and then a woman will go, Hey, Carl, come here.
2160840	2164760	And it'll just be this sexy lady. And then they'll just keep cutting to the leprechaun behind the
2164760	2171320	crate going like, and he does it over and over and over again. And it keeps, I think it kind of
2171320	2176920	escalates. Like I feel like the leprechaun series is about on another level. It's about a bicurious
2176920	2183080	kind of mythical creature. Like he's, it feel like he's getting more and more either honest or
2183080	2186920	dishonest. I can't tell because one of them's about him and he wants to marry this woman,
2186920	2190920	but then he keeps on, he's like, Oh, I've got, I've got you here. Oh, my bride. Oh,
2190920	2195400	but he never does anything with her. And then he keeps making excuses to go out and just pose as
2195400	2200600	more women and have fake, fake leprechaun sex with men. You know, I don't know. Watch it. Tell,
2200600	2204760	tell me what you think. Just put more thought into leprechaun sequels than any other,
2204760	2210680	including the people that made them. Well, that may be true, but mythology has a life of its own.
2210680	2214360	And I feel the story being told with the leprechaun character. He's like Ulysses, you know,
2214360	2219000	he's his own character. And I think that his character exists in a maelstrom of sexual
2219000	2223960	feelings. You know, I feel I feel like he's like popping out of the in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in
2223960	2229960	modern America. And he's going like, Oh, it seems like the standards are a bit different now. Oh,
2229960	2237960	what was once a little weird to go to as a place like is now a little more. Oh, okay. I could have
2237960	2243480	a lot of fun around here. And he's sort of like, you're watching him like kind of pushes boundaries,
2243480	2249560	his own personal boundaries. Like he's getting over his own cathexes. Like there's no, there's
2249560	2254760	no sign on the wall that says don't be gay. Like he's that's in his head, but he's kind of like
2254760	2259400	pushing it and pushing it. Like, and he gets increasingly like more sexually amorphous as
2259400	2263320	the series continues. So I think if they make another leprechaun movie, they should just have
2263320	2267000	them like naked, like, like, and just kind of like, like, they're making another one. It comes out
2267000	2270200	this month. Okay. Thank you. Adam Goldberg says they're making another one comes out this month.
2270200	2275480	I hope it's called like leprechaun. The gloves are off. And, and, and, and by gloves, we mean
2275480	2280440	sexual hang ups, you know, and have them just have it. Maybe it's not a horror movie. Maybe it's a,
2280440	2286200	maybe it's just about, you know, like, like him doing his thing. Like, like, why, why have to end
2286200	2291640	it with a guy's face getting cut off? You know, if clearly, if you look at the amount of time that's
2291640	2296680	spent in each leprechaun movie percentage wise, it's really the more important theme in these
2296680	2304680	movies is, is a bisexuality. I didn't watch all the, you know, all the secrets. Do they keep up with
2304680	2308520	that? I really remember the first one anymore was like they stopped him by throwing shoes at him
2308520	2312680	because he had a thing where you had to clean shoes. Yeah, that's the original. You've watched,
2312680	2317560	you've watched over 2000 movies now. And you didn't get through more than one leprechaun.
2320440	2324040	No, like, I know the leprechauns are like, it's just the ones that, I mean, the first one actually
2324040	2329800	played theatrically. And then this, and it's with a, with a child, like, like,
2331400	2336520	unrecognizable recommendation. I don't know how easy it is to do with Netflix's or Hulu's or
2336520	2343480	whatever. But at some point in my life, a friend of mine got his hands on a copy of Child's Play.
2343480	2351240	It was a Mexican or the Spanish dub, the Spanish dub of Child's Play. And it is hilarious. It's the
2351240	2356040	best fucking thing. If you want to have a good time with your friends, get Spanish Child's Play,
2356040	2360920	because he's just this, they give him this kind of speedy Gonzales voice that is really,
2360920	2370040	is really, he's just this little, little, little Spanish guy running around and it's good.
2370040	2376200	Also ET, ET in Spanish is hilarious because he really is like, he just sounds like an immigrant,
2376200	2387160	like an illegal alien. And a second, it takes on a different meaning. Also,
2388120	2394360	different, not horror, break into, is that electric boogaloo? Rent that movie. Is that the
2394360	2400360	one with turbo in it? Or is that, is that turbo? Anytime turbo is on, freeze frame,
2401160	2404920	because he's making the funniest face in the world. I sent this out there, put it on,
2404920	2412120	like, go to, like, send images to me. Anytime turbo is on the camera, hit pause, funniest shit
2412120	2415720	you'll ever see in your life. Get high and watch break into and hit the pause.
2416520	2419880	We should, we should have like, like Oprah's book club. We could have like a, we could have
2419880	2424280	an assign, like, oh, let's all watch before we reconvene. Let's all watch. We'll pick one
2424280	2427320	movie that we can watch this week. Let's all watch Hard Targets. I'll talk about it. I'll
2427320	2430440	talk about Wofford Brimley afterwards. Maybe we'll pick one by the end of the
2430440	2435720	show and experiment with that concept. Uh, uh, so it's, it's, it's called horror movie a day
2435720	2442040	dot com. Or yeah, it's on blog spot, but yeah, it's on blog spot. I mean, I don't know how you
2442040	2447240	guys feel about that. Well, it's got this long cause it's blog spot, you know, it's a URL. So
2447240	2451800	it's like a whole bunch of terrible dashes and stuff. So just horror movie day dot com. It'll
2451800	2459880	redirect you. It'll, it'll, it'll slash through your, uh, URL and, and murder it. Um, horror movie
2459880	2465560	a day dot com. Uh, thank, thank you, uh, Brian W. Collins for visiting us on the eve of your,
2465560	2469240	uh, thank you, Brian.
2475000	2476200	He seems like an okay guy.
2478040	2482200	He seems like I lose my mind watching that many horror movies. I like, I like, I like, I like
2482200	2487400	random, like, like, yeah, like I need something like that. I need some kind of thing to come into
2487400	2493000	my life where I'm like, I mean, I have a thing, you know, where you go like, okay, I'm going to
2493000	2498760	do this thing now. It's called Minecraft. Well, no, that's, that's just, you know, like, that's,
2498760	2503080	that's not, if I were to say, I'm going to play two hours of Minecraft every day or something,
2503080	2508120	you could turn something unhealthy into something healthy structure, you know, but that's not going
2508120	2512520	to be it. That's dumb. That's a dumb idea. You just pitched, you know, it's a dumb idea.
2513640	2516920	Something like, I'm going to, I'm going to do stained glass in my basement. I'm going to make
2516920	2523320	a stained glass duck. I'm going to make up, I'm going to make my own BB gun. I'm going to make
2523320	2529080	a BB gun and it's going to fire a real BB. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to,
2529080	2535320	I'm going to, uh, uh, uh, don't you owe Fox a script right now? Yeah. I'm going to write that,
2535320	2541400	but then like, you know, like, if I'm a Fox exec and I'm hearing this podcast next week and you're
2541400	2546680	talking about making BB guns, I'm like, where's my sitcom? Yeah, I think they've moved on. I think
2546680	2551800	if they're smart, but I'm saying I need a hobby, you know, at a certain point, as soon as I finish
2551800	2557000	my job, I need a hobby. Uh, uh, let's keep the train rolling and bring, and bring, and bring,
2557000	2571880	let's get Spencer up here, huh? Because, uh, we also watched space jam, uh, last night. I got
2571880	2576600	drunk and went home. I missed that one. Hello, Spencer. How are you, man? I'm, um, I'm, I'm, I'm
2576600	2582920	good. I'm good. Hey, that was a measured response. Did you stay for all the space jam? No, I left
2582920	2588120	pretty early. I mean, I've seen that movie, but I used to watch that a lot. I had, um, you know,
2588120	2594680	what were those the Martian guys called? The Monstars. No, before that they had it like a dumb name
2594680	2600200	that wasn't a team. It was like something Ling, I think. I don't know. Whatever. I had stuffed
2600200	2604840	animal versions of all the puny little versions. It was pretty awesome. And I had like a favorite,
2604840	2610040	you know, but they were all really like cut and paste before they got like superpowers. So,
2610040	2613880	yeah, I don't know. So they were just different colors. I was like, is space jam like the bugs
2613880	2621080	bunny? Yeah. Yeah. Michael Jordan and Bill Murray and Newman. Yeah. I imagine space jam might be some
2621080	2626200	people's Xanadu in this room, you know, given the age. Does anybody here love space jam? Yeah. My
2626200	2631160	applause. Don't know. Raise your hand. Really? Explain it knowing that it's terrible and non
2631160	2635800	ironically, or is it an ironic love? I grew up in Chicago in the nineties. Michael Jordan was like a
2635800	2639720	God. I thought it was the greatest movie ever made. So you love it because Michael Jordan is a
2639720	2645560	protagonist in it or is he like a guest star in it or is he? No, no, he's a buddy comedy with him
2645560	2652680	and you know, bucks bunny space jam. Yeah. Wait, all I remember is that as Marvin Martins in it,
2652680	2658040	right? Isn't he out there? Like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All the Looney Tunes are in it and
2658760	2665160	they play basketball. If I, if I were to, the, I tried to run through today, the narrative like,
2665160	2672360	like kind of cascade of like, why ending with the answer to why are they playing basketball?
2672360	2677800	Why? What are the stakes? It starts five iterations up like on a, on a planet that is
2678600	2685400	both animated, but not Looney Tune planet. It's a planet of animated monsters that need amusement.
2685400	2691560	They're in an amusement shortage and the boss of that planet says, I want the Looney Tunes to work
2691560	2695880	for us. And he sends his henchmen out and the henchmen go and they make the, they tell the Looney
2695880	2700920	Tunes, you have to work for us. And the Looney Tunes go, you know, they use Bugs Bunny clever power
2700920	2706440	to go, Hey, we have to, we get a chance to fight back before you indenture us into servitude.
2706440	2711080	And instead, instead of just saying you, you're not allowed to do this, Bugs Bunny says, you have
2711080	2718120	to give us a right chance to fight back. And they go, okay, how? And they go, okay, they're really
2718120	2724840	small. So let's play basketball. So then because they say basketball, the monster aliens steal the
2724840	2730040	talent from Charles Barkley and Lil Penny or whatever, whoever was in a Nike commercial back
2730040	2737800	then. And they all grow big because that means they're talented. And and the, because they do
2737800	2743000	that, then the Looney Tunes go and abduct Michael Jordan from a golf course. Meanwhile, there's a
2743000	2748120	B story to the movie which details Michael Jordan's emotional journey from going from basketball
2748120	2755720	player to baseball player to golf hobbyist and friend of Bill Murray. Bill Murray, meanwhile,
2755720	2764040	walks into and out of the movie of his own free will. Anytime he wants, just like in the middle
2764040	2771400	of his own scenes to just just go, Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to just disappear from
2771400	2775880	coverage. Where'd Bill Murray go? Wasn't he there a second ago? Yeah, I guess he got tired. It's like,
2775880	2781800	it's like a tootsie. He's there. He's gone. Yeah, he's just bad. And so there's another character
2781800	2787800	played by the fat guy from Jurassic Park who I, my writer's eye tells me it's the same character.
2787800	2793080	Yeah, Wayne Knight. Yeah. It's the same character, but for all the scenes Bill Murray couldn't do.
2793080	2797320	No, Wayne Knight is kind of, there's another character. He's Michael Jordan's agent or
2797320	2802920	something. But anyways, like I said, if I were to start trying to explain Space Jam to you,
2802920	2807960	we'd be here till like 9pm. But there are people here that love the movie. And don't
2807960	2811000	marry it. So it's simply because you were from Chicago and Michael Jordan lived there.
2811880	2815480	It was great. Come up on stage. Can we get you on stage? Let's get you. What's your name?
2816520	2821880	What's your name? Shannon. Come on, Mike. Shannon, Shannon, Shannon, Space Jam apologist.
2823240	2828200	I mean, like, I love being right about stuff. So let me, let me try to, I'll answer the question
2828200	2834680	for her and we'll see if she agrees. Some movies are so like loud and big and weird and so have
2834680	2838520	such a time in your life. That's why I brought up the Xanadu comparison. There's no arguing with
2838520	2843080	Xanadu is a good movie. Xanadu is an insane movie though. And it was part of my childhood.
2843080	2849880	All right, go Shannon. So when someone asks, do you like it ironically or none of that? No,
2849880	2854920	I like Mac and me ironically. Like that's a horrible movie and I don't actually have any
2854920	2860280	connection to it, but you have an emotional connection to Space Jam. But you could probably
2860280	2866200	recognize with your adult brain. Yes. Yes. But that doesn't, you know, it doesn't stop me from
2866200	2871320	having kind of an emotional reaction to it even now in adulthood. And there's a lot of movies.
2871320	2878360	Goonies. I'm looking at you like my generation. I'm 40 now. I can finally start saying this
2878360	2883320	without getting booed because I'm getting so old. But 10 years ago, if I said Goonies was shitty,
2884200	2898600	which it is, it is Goonies is a ridiculous cacophony of logical loop-de-loops. It is an insane,
2898600	2907880	it is an opera written by a madman in a footlocker at the bottom of the ocean. Like there is
2908120	2912600	Goonies is out of the. So what's a better movie as a whole? Space Jam or Goonies?
2914200	2917560	Space Jam. No, fuck you. No, Goonies is better than Space Jam.
2919080	2923800	No, Goonies. You pushed him. I almost had him. Goonies is better than Space Jam. Goonies.
2925320	2929240	Okay. Here's the difference between a sociopath and a like a regular murderer.
2929480	2932520	Like Goonies knows what it's doing wrong.
2934360	2940920	Like Space Jam will kill again if you don't lock it up. Space Jam has no idea. Space Jam's like,
2940920	2947720	what? Yeah, I'm a movie. Goonies is like, like, like, like, like, I'm a movie. Like they know,
2947720	2955000	they know. Like, if there was a Goonies too, we'd focus on the chunk character more
2955880	2961720	and do more blender scenes with. Space Jam would be like, well, what have we learned?
2964680	2968840	I don't feel like Space Jam knew what it was doing. Shannon, how many times have you seen
2968840	2974440	Space Jam, Shannon? How many times have you viewed Space Jam? In my childhood, probably in the
2974440	2979720	dozens. I haven't seen it in quite a while because my parents have it on VHS and nobody fucking has
2979720	2988600	a VCR anymore. Right. Really? Space Jam party. You can probably, I'm sure it's Space Jam's on
2988600	2995320	YouTube. I mean, it's not, I don't know. Yeah, I'm 40. I don't care. Is it Space Jam and one of your
2995320	3000760	little friendship bracelets? Can't you just download it on a USB dongle? Shannon, what are
3000760	3007560	your favorite movies of all time? What do you think of as your favorite genre, your favorite
3007560	3011560	kind of movie or your favorite? Do you have a favorite movie? My favorite movie is Stripes,
3011560	3017400	actually. Stripes is a goodie. Which, when's the last time you saw it? Probably in the last year.
3017400	3021320	I have it on DVD. Yeah. I mean, some of these movies you go back to, like Back to the Future.
3021320	3025480	I saw Double Feature, Back to the Future and Goonies and it was like a, because they're both
3025480	3031080	right around the same time, but it was like a study in, okay, there are movies from your,
3031080	3035560	from a certain age when your brain was like firing certain chemicals. Like you have permanent
3035560	3040360	imprints on these movies and I would call them identical walking into that theater
3040360	3044280	as a 30-something. I was like, I'm going to see Goonies and Back to the Future too, indelible,
3045560	3050840	comparable, like masterpieces of my, from my childhood era. But walking out of the theater,
3050840	3057080	I was like, okay, come on. Goonies was a, is a nostalgic mess. Back to the Future, I think,
3057080	3062280	remains as kind of a well-structured like little piece of cinema that took seven years to write
3062280	3069640	and blah, blah, blah. What were we talking about? Space Jam. Space Jam versus Stripes,
3069640	3073800	like Stripes I'm afraid to go back and watch is my point. Why would you be afraid? I'm just afraid
3073800	3077800	it will be a Goonies and rather, rather than a Back to the Future. Stripes is hilarious because
3077800	3085160	there's 11 35-year-olds pretending to join the military. There's clearly people in their 40s
3085160	3091800	that are in this unit. It's really funny. And everybody's drunk in it. John Candy, John
3091800	3095880	Lirikett, everybody's just a bunch of alcoholics. I remember what that movie is. It has a very
3095880	3100840	strange, it's got a three act structure overall, but it also exists in two giant acts because
3100840	3106280	there's the point where they actually like in the 11th hour, like, but the movie's only halfway over.
3106280	3110760	Like it seems like the movie is over. It turns into this weird action movie with the RV and stuff,
3110760	3116520	but it was good. It shares that with the good Batman movie. Like that Batman movie was like,
3116520	3121720	what the fuck? When's this over? I don't care. I don't know. All right. Now, okay. Truck chase.
3121720	3131080	Okay. Fuck it. Well, thank you Shannon. Shannon, everybody. Thanks for coming up and talking about
3132040	3140920	Space Jam. Space Jam. But they come up with that name too. Weird. I'll tell you exactly where they
3140920	3146360	came up with that name. They tested each letter of each word. They're like, uh, okay. So far we've
3146360	3156440	got spud come. No, no, no. People like a more than you. There was a space spade come. I was
3156440	3160440	surprised because there was jock jams at that point, right? Like, wasn't there a thing where
3160440	3165880	I don't know. I would like to be a fly on any wall during any part of any branch. Adam Goldberg.
3165880	3170280	Why was it called Space Jam? They use jam all the time in the nineties. It was the number one word
3170280	3179720	the way rad ruled the eighties. It didn't. That's not your name. And consulting producer on community
3179720	3184760	Adam F Goldberg's name. Not the same person. Okay. That was my fault. That was my bad.
3185880	3192120	No, I tap that hornet's nest. When he was, when he started saying they use jam all the
3192120	3196360	time in the nineties, I was like, wait a minute. Come on. Like, like, I thought he meant like
3196360	3201160	jelly. No, come on. No more than the eighties. I was there for all of this.
3202280	3208920	Jam did not become a bigger thing. I'm officially my grandpa. The nineties had young man jam. Jam
3209000	3215000	is a universal. The nineties did have jock jams and Pearl jams. And we had less than nineties.
3215960	3221000	Jack jams and Pearl jams. Isn't that gross that they named their band Pearl Jam? That's gross.
3221880	3226120	Pearl jam sucks. Fuck Pearl Jam. Oh, come on. Oh, fuck them. That's terrible. Hey,
3226920	3231080	Jeff. Why are you going to make me feel bad about my band?
3231080	3242360	No. We are people. We have feelings. You've got them.
3244920	3249080	It was the nineties was a great time to be an angry white guy and maybe I'll bum down and wear
3249080	3255000	a fucking helmet before we called it emo and just kind of like, like both embraced it and wrote it
3255000	3259560	off. It was like it was being presented as if this is the new thing. I think that was what was
3259560	3264120	uncomfortable for people. And I invite all of you to tell me I'm a bad person on online for
3264120	3267560	not liking Pearl Jam. It's going to happen. There'll be a lot of bad. I don't think that's going to
3267560	3272520	happen. You know why? Because they're indefensible. Pearl Jam is an unsupportable band. They'll
3272520	3276360	accept. They're, they're these guys. Look at them. Look at, look out in this audience. Look at these
3276360	3284280	Shannon. Do you love Pearl Jam too? Okay, good. So she's not just jam centric. These guys are post
3284280	3289320	iTunes. They're little, they're little tune babies. They're, they have little, they have
3289320	3295560	little hologram dongles that they use to subscribe to their music from a, from a stream in a cloud.
3295560	3300200	And part parcel of that is that they don't, they don't, they don't have the same emotional,
3300200	3304360	they don't, they don't, you know, they go, Oh, did you hear, hear that new granddaddy?
3305160	3316760	I heard that EP was an LP on the SP. You know, no, I don't. I don't either. I'm just trying to get through it.
3317880	3321240	You know, it's like, like you had to put all this energy into buying an album.
3321240	3325080	Spencer, if you had bought, if you bought a Led Zeppelin album and like, like someone
3325080	3329320	else said Led Zeppelin sucked. Oh, you got something to defend. But if you download
3329320	3334360	zigger spligot, you know, it's like you listen to me, you know, you don't care. Like you got a
3334360	3339160	whole fucking catalog of shit. Like every, everyone's an individual, like the, you know,
3340280	3344600	so they don't really care that much if someone goes like, and no one's gonna go that stupid,
3344600	3349320	that sucks. I think maybe I'm projecting onto them my wishes for the younger generation to be
3349320	3355960	more action actualized. Spencer, are you a music purchaser? Do you, are you a music guy? Uh, no,
3355960	3361160	I mean, I, I listen to lots of music. I don't purchase a lot of music. How do you, how do you,
3361160	3368360	how do you get your music? Um, you know, sometimes I'm just on my computer and this is like,
3368360	3374040	this is legal stuff, man. This is, they're gonna listen to this podcast. Sometimes a bit like,
3374040	3379720	like just falls on me and then sometimes more of them come in like a torrent of, uh, yeah, yeah.
3380360	3385080	Sometimes you just get caught in a tempest of, of fights of peer to peer pressure.
3389000	3394520	So you've been stealing music online all the time. I mean, I've bought maybe three albums in my life,
3394520	3402600	but I, I, I mean, like, you will pay the piper days of music probably. But I don't know,
3402600	3406680	it's really eclectic. I usually get discographies and then I'm like, Oh, I like this album is this
3406680	3410120	album and delete a lot of stuff. And then I, you know, have what I like. And I kind of just
3410120	3414680	cycle through it randomly. What's in heavy rotation for you right now? What's in the car?
3414680	3421320	Let's see, borders of Canada has some good tracks. Um, yeah, I think the campfire head phase is the
3421320	3427240	album I've been listening to a lot. There's a DeLorean is a band with an album called Subiza,
3427240	3434840	which is just really delicious. Um, gold Panda makes this really weird, um, electronic music.
3434840	3439320	And it's pretty, it's pretty awesome. I listened to it at an airport and it was perfect.
3441800	3445720	Uh, there's, what about nose cone? You listen to nose cone. Oh yeah. You know, nose cone,
3445720	3450280	he had some, some, some deep YouTube riffs. I was really into that. I actually, I just
3450280	3454520	made that name up. I was ripping the audio. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm bullshitting also. Okay.
3455480	3461080	I thought, I thought I riffed a real guy and I wanted to cop to it. I felt bad.
3461800	3465880	I said we play some D&D. How's that sound right now? Well, we gotta get Camille out here. Camille.
3469800	3475000	Camille, you like nose cone? No, I like the peaceful muttons. They're really good right now.
3475000	3482040	Sandblasts. Um, can I, I have a couple points to make. Space Jam is clearly from NBA jam,
3482040	3486600	which was a huge basketball game in the night. Don't clap Adam Goldberg as if that's what you
3486600	3493160	were saying. The other point, you gave it so much shit for exposition. Yeah. It takes,
3493160	3498600	you gotta jump through a lot of hoops to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room.
3499480	3504520	You can't just be like, open on, it can't be like, but open on basketball court. Bugs buddy and
3504520	3508680	Michael Jordan are hanging out. Okay. You have to, here's how many hoops you have to jump through
3508680	3512920	to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room. The same number of hoops that they jumped
3512920	3517400	to get Elmer Fudd and Michael Jordan in the same room. One, they jumped Michael Jordan through a
3517400	3523960	literal and figurative threshold. They sucked him through a golf course hole into cartoon land and
3523960	3531160	Elmer Fudd was right there and said, oh, hi, Michael Daud and I, I love you. Um, what, what,
3531160	3535560	what, what their crime that they committed. By the way, I am not defending this movie at all.
3536360	3541160	Well, just for fun, for fun, defend it. It's really good. You're saying,
3543480	3548280	you're saying it's a necessary evil because of the, because of the subject matter that there needs
3548280	3553800	to be five thresholds instead of one threshold. And I'm saying that will never be true. Uh, uh,
3553800	3559880	until our son supernovas, um, our stories are allowed to just have one fucking like what if
3559880	3567320	I've never, uh, full disclosure, never seen the movie or, or finish the word disclosure.
3568280	3575640	Never done that full disclosure. Can I also, you were talking about human planet. Can I
3575640	3580600	quickly say what my favorite thing of that is? Speak it will. There's one store. It's all like
3580600	3586360	humans in extreme conditions. So Papa New Guinea, there's this one village that just eats sharks.
3586360	3590680	That's all they eat, which is like sort of an arrogant, dickish move, you know? But they're
3590680	3595480	like, you have fruit. What are you doing? They're like, well, sharks, we eat them for breakfast.
3595480	3600280	Like that's what they're going for. So they have one guy in the village who's the designated
3600280	3605720	shark hunter. And now he's like 70 and then they just like send this guy out. He's like, all right,
3605720	3610920	I'll go get more shark. And he gets into a canoe that he's made and he's like seven and he's like
3610920	3613720	ripped. Are these the guys that just like strangle them on the side of the boat? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3613800	3618600	That's what I was going to tell the story. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well, he's like super ripped,
3618600	3622840	like, but he's like, like Nepal ripped, you know, not like Jim ripped, like,
3622840	3625080	like Sri Lanka ripped. So he gets into the boat.
3627560	3633720	I want to be Sri Lanka. It's great. It's great. And he just goes to the middle of the ocean.
3633720	3639880	And then he starts singing his shark beckoning song. No, I fucking swear to you. Yeah. Well,
3639880	3647960	I don't want to do the song for you. Yeah, that's what it is. It would sound like this.
3647960	3653560	What the songs are like pretend you're a racist and then imagine a tribal song. That's what it
3653560	3656920	sounds like. Do it. Do it. Just do it. Now that you just claimed it, but it sounds very.
3659960	3666040	Pearl Jam. You're doing Pearl. Yeah. It's a lot like Pearl Jam. And then he sings this fucking
3666120	3673400	song with a little, just a hint of Hepburn. Just a shining army.
3675080	3677400	It's a little bit like, what was that song? Sadness.
3682040	3688200	But everything's going backwards. What's that called? Enigma. Enigma. Enigma. So he starts
3688200	3693240	singing this fucking song. Okay. And he's singing it all day and all night. There's no food because
3693240	3700520	they run out of shark. All day, all night on day three, a shark shows up. And even then John
3700520	3705160	Hurd is like, and he has the balls to assume it's the song. I know. I want to go up to the guy and
3705160	3712760	be like, try once without the song. One time a control group. Exactly. Just once. Either, either,
3712760	3718360	I, either I believe it was a coincidence or that the magical shark beckoning song works and
3718360	3724360	everything I know is lies, you know? It only takes six days to test the theory that without a song,
3724360	3729400	the shark takes twice as long to show up. Just do it once. So the shark shows up and then he
3729400	3734840	starts fashioning a noose, which I'm like, have the noose already fashioned? You've been there
3734840	3742680	for three days. Get the noose. Act like you've been there, you know? So he can't be, do, have.
3742680	3749720	Yeah. So he always be noose making, but this is my favorite part. He always be noose making
3751080	3757880	shark is for closers. I've got a 12 foot boat. I've got a custom made shark news. That's my name.
3758600	3764200	Who the fuck are you? Well, it presents the shark stranglers.
3765880	3770920	So he fashions this news and as the shark, this is my favorite part. As the shark is going by,
3770920	3776680	he lassles the shark in the open ocean. He lasses it and then I swear he lasses it and then he does
3776680	3782360	like a fist bump. He's like, yes. So I'm like, we're all human. Everybody does that because like,
3782360	3785880	that's the only gesture we have. You might have picked that up from the camera crew.
3787400	3792680	Holy shit. I have just enough SD card to store that footage. Yeah. And he was like, oh really?
3793800	3797720	Exactly. So like the SD card gesture, I wonder that when they're getting the shots, it's like
3797720	3801240	clearly you're getting the shot from a Jeep, but you're studying these guys who just hang out with
3801240	3805960	wearing blankets for shirts and bluffing lions. Like how much, I mean, the gods must be crazy.
3805960	3811080	Like what's happening here? I always thought there was like a couple of years ago, they found a new
3811080	3815480	tribe in the Amazon and all the pictures were like, they were like, we don't, you know, they're like
3815480	3819640	looking up at this thing, this helicopter, and they were like, we didn't want to disturb them
3819640	3825240	because we didn't want to go down. You've already changed everything. That helicopter is their god
3825320	3832280	now. It's like Iceman. Yeah. They're gonna go back and be like, burn the books. This is all lies.
3832280	3841080	Look at that thing. Look at that. Todd, what have I been saying? Yeah. See, I told you, metal burn.
3841080	3846840	I used to worship a toucan. Look at that fucking thing. There's three of us inside that toucan.
3847560	3851960	They're clearly like, all of them have like their bows and arrows out, like pointing at this thing.
3852200	3855800	You've changed everything. I don't even mean like, why does it all give them ACDC pictures? That's
3855800	3860840	a clear example of those guys. Those guys actually live in actual isolation and that kind of
3860840	3864840	contamination. But also there's just like, these people, they know what a jeep is and they know
3864840	3869160	what a camera crew is. They're bringing a camera crew along and they're saying like, the camera crew
3869160	3878040	is going, show us how you bring your 18 cattle from 600 miles across the desert and then have
3878040	3882600	a weird negotiation with the elephants with a stick in order to get your cattle fed. And it's
3882600	3887480	like, I just mean like emotional, psychological, long-term contamination of like this 16 year old
3887480	3894200	kid going like, fuck, go faster in a jeep. Yeah. All right. See you later. That's a wrap. Yeah.
3894200	3898280	They should just show them on their iPad like Phantom Menace. Like watch this. All right. We're
3898280	3903720	gonna go. Yeah. Like, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's, it's, it's so weird. Like, like, like,
3903720	3907560	that's not, I know everyone knows it's weird. All right. Aaron McGathey, you're here tonight.
3907560	3914680	Let's get Aaron McGathey up here. The only thing I just saw, leprechaun in the hood. The only thing
3914680	3920280	I wanted from that movie was the leprechaun to refer to as part of gold as bling. That is all
3920280	3924360	I wanted out of it. That might've come, the bling might've happened after the first leprechaun in
3924360	3930040	the hood. Maybe. Cause I didn't, he wasn't ever like, I got to get some bling or whatever. They
3930120	3937960	really like, it was a very selective, like, uh, uh, membrane in terms of what racism got through
3937960	3942360	and what they refused it to. It's very, very weird. Like you'd look at one example and go like,
3942360	3947000	well, that's just, that's just ridiculous. Like, why would you do that? And then, and then the
3947000	3952120	other one would go, well, why would you choke up on that bat? I can't think of examples, but, um,
3952120	3958440	the, the, um, when you watch leprechaun tonight, um, here's an interesting thing.
3958440	3964040	There's this, there's a point in the movie where, where he has beguiled this trio of, uh,
3964040	3967640	hoochie mamas, uh, badonkadonks. I don't know what you'd call them in the parlour.
3967640	3969400	I think that's the preferred nomenclature.
3970600	3972040	There's zombie fly ladies.
3972040	3976760	There's zombie fly ladies. And that's right. It's a sort of multi-ethnic like, like trio of like,
3976760	3981400	like, yeah, they have green eyes underneath their ray bands and they have like gold type fitting,
3981400	3988920	lame dresses and, um, and they don't match with their shoes. Um, the, um, they don't explain
3988920	3994200	where they came from except through some weird ADR line. Then they're just there. Then during
3994200	4001000	the ending credits, you see the origin. He does a rap in a, which you would expect to see in a movie
4001000	4005560	called leprechaun and a hood. You'd expect to see where would Davis do a rap and he doesn't do it
4005560	4009880	until the ending credits. And he's like, oh, my name is leprechaun. I'm here to say I just came
4009880	4015800	from Dublin to shuttle today. I got my bling bling bloom and my blarney stone and I'll
4015800	4021000	possess your mind and you're not alone. And, uh, he, while he's doing it, he's like, he's like
4021000	4025720	hypnotizing these fly girls in this bar that we never saw in the movie. So it seems very clear
4025720	4031400	to me that they extracted that scene from the middle of the movie where it really belonged.
4031400	4036280	And they, and the only reason I can think that they extracted it is that they actually hit some
4036360	4041800	kind of threshold where people, the test viewers are like, yeah, you know what? Come on. I want to,
4041800	4045480	I want to like, I want to like make fun of the movie. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to,
4045480	4050040	I don't want you to piranha 3d me. Like, like, like, like they actually hit like a tipping point
4050040	4053640	where people are like, fuck you. Like, like, like when he started rapping, it's like, well, what,
4053640	4058680	what's my job? Uh, I'm supposed to get high and watch a movie. Oh, if you guys are high,
4058680	4064360	fuck you. And they went, oh, you know what? Yeah. People, people like that it's campy. They like that
4064360	4068440	it's stupid. They want to make fun of the movie. Like we need to actually commit to our job and
4068440	4073800	move this rap to the credit. I thought you were saying that they'd hit too many like cultural,
4073800	4079240	like urban things. And then people were like, all right, that's too much shit. And then over the
4079240	4083400	credits, you can be as offensive as you want. That wasn't my guess. I truthfully on that topic,
4083400	4089160	I felt like like all pound for pound. I thought that they actually like, I found myself going,
4089160	4094040	I expected to be quote unquote offended, you know, to have, I expected to be going, what,
4094040	4099000	like way more per minute. Yeah. This movie like kind of safe. It was pretty safe for a movie
4099000	4104520	called leprechaun into hood. I just feel like he, Warwick Davis has said little people writes back
4104520	4111000	like so many hundreds of years with his body of work. I mean, has he, or is he, uh, is he, is he,
4111000	4115640	it's like one, like, you know, you like, wow, God, how do I get out of this?
4116600	4123400	What I was going to say, like, it's true for a lot of like urban youth, the way out is basketball
4123400	4128360	or rapping. Right. And so for little people, now it's like becoming in horror movies.
4128360	4133800	Are you a hero? If you get into the NBA or are you perpetuating like a cycle of like on,
4133800	4137960	you know, unrealistic expectations or, or, or whatever that you would call it. No idea.
4137960	4143320	But I want to see a one act, uh, black box theater production about a mythical meeting, uh, on a
4143320	4148280	fateful, uh, 1998 night between Peter Dinklage and Warwick Davis. He was like, all right, I'm
4148280	4153160	going to go to the right. You go to the left. I'm going to do eventually Game of Thrones and
4153160	4157720	movies that are Oscars. You can rap in an Irish accent. Like they do plays of like, what if,
4157720	4162360	what if on the eve of his assassination, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, like had a conversation,
4162360	4170120	like they do plays like that. I bet they hate each other. But you have, you have normal people
4170120	4174440	play the like non little people. Cause you're like, like, like, like, no, the, the big draw here
4174440	4179000	is that, you know, this is, I mean, God, this is David Strathane for God's sakes. He's a,
4179000	4182840	you just tie like shoes at their knees. Is that what you're suggesting? Dorf style?
4182840	4186040	Maybe you just make the sets really quick. Yeah. Yeah. Just make Lily Tomlin,
4186040	4189640	it just have giant chairs. It's going to all be set at, uh, Abed, real Abed's restaurant.
4190840	4194040	No, that's the other way. It's going to be the reverse of that.
4194040	4197000	Or maybe it starts at Abed's restaurant and then they leave. You're like, Oh no,
4197000	4202120	everything there was little, you don't know. He says goodbye. Thank you for coming to what's
4202120	4207960	the name of Abed's restaurant. And then you, didn't you pitch an idea where it's just leftovers
4208600	4213320	that it was like, it was just bites, bites taken out of burgers and stuff.
4213320	4218440	My question was, would it be things shaped like the bite that somebody would be a hamburger
4218440	4223240	with a bite already taken out of it? No, I think the appeal is that it's a miniature version of
4223960	4229800	it. Yeah. Although that's a good idea. Yeah. You could call it, are you going to finish that?
4231480	4234040	All right, Spencer, get us up to date on the, uh, D and D with you.
4237640	4247080	All right. Last town on Harmon town. Wait, wait, wait. Last town? What? Sorry. Go ahead.
4248120	4252760	After fighting with a grip of sinister serpentine foes, Sharpie had been poisoned.
4252760	4257560	As the fast acting poison course through his veins, the wizard fell into a deep slumber.
4257560	4262840	Realizing what must be done, Mulrain Sedana donned her hat of disguise, taking the form of someone
4262840	4267880	she thought looked, must look like Sharpie's mother before attempting some curious reprogramming on
4267880	4273880	the sleeping mage. Quark and Christopher got uncomfortable and checked out some old statues
4273880	4278760	to pass the time. But realizing the flaws in Mulrain's methodology attempted to grease the
4278760	4282680	wheels on the whole situation. After being gripped tightly by the dreaming wizard,
4282680	4287160	Christopher freaked out and stabbed him with a knife, waking the wizard with a quick prick.
4287800	4292760	After some discussion, the group entered the larger chamber, bisected by a cracked staircase,
4292760	4296680	and started to try and figure out some rope situations to get the treasure.
4296680	4302520	Their musings were interrupted by a powerful voice taunting them. A dragon! Recognizing the dire
4302520	4306920	danger that this magical beast presented, the gang launched into action. The barbarian slashed
4306920	4312360	in rage and then tried to climb up to statue or something. Mulrain fired arrows. Sharpie
4312360	4316600	summoned the monstrous scorpions, Keith and David, to distract and threaten the dragon while the
4316600	4323000	sneaky robes stabbed the dragon in the dick with a paralyzing syringe. The attacks seemed to be
4323000	4333560	working, but still the dragon fought on. Spencer, everybody. I just remembered last week marked a
4333560	4338760	milestone where we played D&D for like, it seemed like 40 minutes, and then at the end of it,
4338760	4344120	Spencer was like, you guys have to stop. It's gonna take a long time to kill that dragon.
4344120	4347960	Which is, which was kind of a, it was a milestone because we were engrossed. If you listen to the
4347960	4354040	recording, we were like, we had finally stopped going like, D&D, like, we've got to make sure
4354040	4358840	stays on, you know, like a little cliffhanger. And Spencer was like, you guys knock it off.
4358840	4363800	Well, yeah, go to bed. I thought that you would, I thought you were just expecting me to like,
4363800	4369080	truncate the combat at the end of the session sort of thing. And I'm like, no, no, there's a dragon.
4369080	4375080	How many hits have we put on this dragon? Let's see. I think you hit it once, sliced it in the
4375080	4381160	neck. He took an arrow or two. You shot him in between the eyes, I think, and it made him look
4381160	4385400	kind of. He was in berserker rage and he did some stuff. Yeah. And then yeah, he hit him in a berserker
4385400	4389880	rage and, and, and distracted him while you got in position. And then you went and tried to climb
4389880	4395320	up a statue to jump off of it, but you failed the climb check. Right. You, you summon this,
4395320	4399960	a scorpion didn't do much. Then you summon another scorpion. Keith and David. Yeah, Keith and David.
4399960	4407960	Okay. So by, by popular demand, by popular hand wringing brow sweating demand, check in with us
4407960	4413320	about our hit points and get definitive for the people because they never know. People tweet me
4413320	4417640	and they go, I don't know when to be concerned that you guys are about to die. I don't know what's
4417640	4421400	going on. It's like, like, like we don't, we don't pay attention to that because we're a bunch of
4421400	4427720	drunk like performers. Like we never go, Oh shit, I have three hit points. Yeah, it's true. Um,
4429480	4437240	Sharpie right now you're at 24 hit points. Yeah. That's like, you have like a smoker's hit points.
4437960	4445240	Yeah. It's not bad. You're okay. What's the, what's the range? Well, you, you, you, you max out every
4445240	4453720	time you level up your maximum hit points, uh, go up like a video game. No. How many does Christa
4453720	4458680	Berg have right now? Christa Berg is a sitting pretty at a 43. I don't think he's gotten hit
4458680	4465960	this whole time to be honest. Yeah. Yeah. How's how many more rain? Yeah. Uh, right now you have 35
4465960	4471400	on this. Okay. Cool. And I have a maximum of 51. I took a beating last time. Yeah. You're right.
4471400	4477960	Actually right now at 38. So we're all doing pretty well. That's not bad. No, no, it's true.
4477960	4483480	All right. So the dragon still pacing the cage and it's still got a numb Dick, right? Yeah. Yeah.
4483480	4488520	The poison hasn't quite, you know, taken hold, but, um, yeah, it was, it was in the, it was in the,
4488520	4493800	it was in the Dick and there's, and I have two scorpions in here. Yeah. Yeah. Keith and David.
4493800	4499640	Yeah. It's important. And I'm allowed to give them standing orders to attack the
4499640	4503800	scorpion of the dragon. They'll go on your turn. I'll try to remember.
4505800	4515560	I'm, I'm going to put it at a Jeff's turn. Okay. Has my far sword recharged? No, it hasn't in fact.
4515560	4519960	And so can I, can I do a flaming sword attack? Yeah. All right. Flaming sword attack,
4519960	4526120	flaming sword attack with your flaming sword. You charge the dragon and slice towards his flesh,
4526760	4534440	striking a quite decent blow at his chest. Yeah. There we go. Dealing. Um, I'm bad.
4535640	4544040	I hate myself. 11 damage. How much damage did you deal to yourself?
4544760	4549960	I'd say I lost a good, uh, uh, three charisma points.
4555080	4559400	You know? All right. So we've given this guy a lot of hit points. He's taking, he's taking a,
4559400	4565080	you know, he's taking a beating. Who's next? Um, yeah, let's just go down this way and then I'll,
4565080	4571240	I'll go. It'll be easier. Uh, in this, in this area where we are, is it possible to climb up?
4571240	4577080	So we have a, so I have a, an advantage from above. Um, there are those statues,
4577080	4584120	they're a good 15, 20 feet tall. You would be above him. Can I move silently up the statues?
4584120	4589320	Yeah, you can definitely try it, but it's pretty tricky to climb and be a stealthy. So, you know,
4589320	4593400	you're, if your attention is split, it'll be a bit tougher than if you just tried to clamber up it.
4594200	4599160	Okay. Well, I, I wink at Sharpie and I try to climb up the statues. All right.
4600040	4603640	Is that two turns? Well, I officially retire.
4605640	4611960	The wink fails off the lumber. No number. Too high. No die. Yeah. Sorry guys. Spencer's 20
4611960	4617000	sided die fell off the table for the podcast listeners. Or I mean, is it, is it against the
4617000	4622200	rules for this dog leg right on the links? I mean, I guess you already rolled, but would it be too
4622200	4626600	much to say I use the rope to climb up the statue? Well, I would assume you'd use the rope in some
4626600	4632120	fashion. Yeah, totally. Me too. Totally. Yeah. So it's good. You guys are on the same page. Yeah.
4632840	4638360	So throwing the rope over the shoulder of the statue, you catch it and begin to try and
4638360	4644760	hoist yourself up, but the arm of the statue actually breaks off and falls down. You just,
4645560	4651000	you just did that and I empty it out on the ground. That's a, that's a roll of a two by the way,
4651000	4654600	you know? Oh, that's for the listeners. Did the John Williams score go?
4658200	4661640	It's so frustrating watching those movies. Blue balls.
4664280	4668200	So is it me now? Yeah, that'd be you. You've been, you're kind of lurking right now. Am I still
4668200	4672520	stealthy right next to the dragon? Yeah. He hasn't yet noticed you, but you know,
4672520	4676280	he's a bit sluggish. Yeah. Cause of the, the dicks dabbing. Yeah.
4676360	4681400	Yeah. That'll, that'll happen. He's not fucking anything soon.
4682520	4687800	Or he has like great stamina, right? Yeah. Okay. Could go either way. Yeah.
4689400	4696120	So I, do I, do I have another, um, uh, I have another poison deck. I have a poison. Yeah.
4696120	4703160	Yeah. You have a poison dagger. It's true. Can I just stab him in the same deck?
4704120	4709320	How many go through as opposed to go for a more vital part of him, like his head or his heart or
4709320	4714840	something like that. How many dicks do dragons have? This is a question I've been asking for years.
4716040	4717720	How many dragons do you know?
4722040	4729880	That movie sucks. Just the one. Take exception to your critique. Just the one dick. Just the one
4729960	4736040	dick. Where is it? A good idea to stab the, you know, wherever you can,
4738040	4741800	you can't afford to be picky. Am I still close to the deck? You're not too,
4741800	4745000	you're actually a good, like 15 feet off at this point. You know,
4745000	4748600	get him in a major artery or a blood vessel or something, but I don't know where that would be.
4748600	4753640	That's true. You wouldn't. Ah, guys, I'm just going to play it safe and stab him in the dick.
4753640	4761400	All right. Go with what you know, Christoper. Christoper, you are kind of a one hit one. Yeah,
4761400	4767720	with everything. I know one thing and I just fucking go at it. Yeah, I mean, I guess don't
4767720	4773240	change. Yes. Stabbing in the dick is the dragon fighting version of Lady in Red.
4774360	4779560	So do you think that a dragon dick hurt you in the past? Or just a dick that would to him
4779560	4787000	was larger when he was at a certain age? Right. So, um, as a rogue, you have the ability to sneak
4787000	4791320	attack, which means if they're kind of unaware of you, you can do extra damage. So do you want to,
4791320	4794920	you want to go for that probably, right? Yeah. And the good thing is his dick is already numb,
4794920	4798520	so it'll do damage, but he won't know that I'm there. He'll just be bleeding out and he won't
4798520	4806440	even know. It's crazy. Yeah. No, I'm enthusiastic about this choice. Honestly. Honestly. I hope he
4806440	4814280	isn't. I hope he isn't either. Huh? Yeah. Okay. Striking him directly in the dick with the poison
4814280	4825720	dagger. You score a seemingly nice score. Nice cut. This is the funk break.
4829800	4834040	I'm just pitching a music video right now of a dragon, a dragon looking down at his numb dick.
4835000	4837320	And there's like rose petals falling from the sky.
4850600	4855160	So a pretty good slice. Yeah. Pretty good slice. You could tell the, you know, the poison, uh,
4855880	4862120	poured in, you know, to the phallus. So that's, that's, you know, you got, you got paralyzing
4862120	4867560	poison. You got that red poison. I think it was the dagger guys. I'm doing great work. Yeah.
4868840	4878040	Not bad. Not bad at all. But you also deal. That's a Jesus Christ. 10 damage. It's like almost all
4878040	4882280	the damage amounts have been 10 and 11 and it's weird. Is that low or high? It's, it's, it's pretty
4882280	4887320	solid, but it's just weird. It's like, I don't know, maybe rolling sevens, you know, two sixes.
4887320	4895320	We should go to Vegas. Yeah. Let's do it. Seriously. Spencer, me and you fucking MGM. Let's
4895320	4899560	get this fucking on. You know, I've never been to Vegas. We should go together. I've never been
4899560	4907400	either. Let's all go. I don't want to go with you guys. The city may never sleep, but I could have
4907400	4917080	been a light. Spencer and Jeff at Vegas is a movie. I will wait to rent. Vegas Jam.
4921640	4924600	So let's go to Vegas when Pearl Jam is playing next
4927160	4935320	and bring Michael Jordan. Oh, the buffet is open from 3 p.m. and I'm lover.
4936040	4940280	Have you, have you seen that movie where it's the guy who goes off into the woods on his own
4940280	4948200	and basically dies? It's like into the, what's it called? Not into the wild. That movie is hilarious
4948200	4953800	because it's this guy living on his own alone and it's literally Eddie Vedder narrating what he's
4953800	4960520	doing. So it's literally Eddie Vedder, like, he made a shower. It's still, it's fucking awful.
4961240	4964280	That's a true story. Yeah, I know. Well, that guy's an idiot.
4965800	4971080	Genuinely is. Anyway, we can jibber jabber all we want, but we have a, we have a dragon.
4973240	4978680	Sidebar. How many monsters can I summon at one time? I have two scorpions on, on, on, on, on,
4978680	4985400	on the, uh, scorp deck. Yeah. You know, I think you can summon, you know, however many, but yeah,
4985400	4989880	I mean, yeah, you can only like do one order though. So you, you have the standing orders
4989880	4994440	to attack, but like, if you had like four monsters, you couldn't be all like you attack. No,
4994440	4999160	no, I don't want to do different shit. That's okay. If I could keep summoning more scorpions
4999160	5002840	every turn and having all those scorpions, well, eventually you're going to run out of spells.
5002840	5007400	I think you got like two more, uh, a level two summons. Is it possible for you to cast ray of
5007400	5010920	frost and for one of us to shatter him? Like, like with a sword attack and like, like, like,
5010920	5016360	take off a leg, like frozen. Yeah. But I mean, it's not very much damage. Yeah. Can we, can you
5016360	5023160	call the next ones Dennis and Hayesbert? Uh, I'm going to let, I'm going to let Keith and David do
5023160	5026920	their thing. I'm going to spend this turn trying to do something a little more. Um, uh, no, no,
5026920	5032520	no. I don't mean I'm passing. I know. Well, I heard you roll. They're attacking, you know,
5032520	5039480	they're like, like you would had ordered. I, um, I want to know about Tasha's hideous laugh again.
5039480	5045640	Yeah. So that's, that's a spell that's a charm spell that if they fail their will save, um,
5045640	5050120	you know, they, they, they lose their action because they're, they're doubled over.
5050120	5055560	Might it work on a large reptile? I mean, dragons in general are pretty hard to charm,
5055560	5059000	but yeah, it would. If, if you rolled, you know, if he rolled poorly,
5064680	5071800	Tasha's hideous laughter. What's he doing? I think he's taking leprechaun in the hood. Yeah.
5071800	5076120	Oh, me don't play that.
5080760	5082920	You guys hang out with this guy, like all the time.
5085240	5087080	You say as you're staring at a dragon's dick.
5088840	5092280	What a weirdo. Anyway, I'm going to continue stabbing this deck.
5092280	5096520	He does, he does pass his will save. So he's unaffected.
5096520	5099880	All right. Well, Keith, David, well, did that do anything to singing? No.
5100840	5103240	But it was worth a shot. My scorpions do this.
5104200	5108840	The scorpions attack. David doesn't manage to strike the high.
5112440	5119240	Why is this happening? However, Keith deals a wicked blow to the back left leg of the dragon
5119960	5127240	dealing eight damage. That's not bad. You basically chipped its nail.
5127240	5132360	So, so right now the dragon has a numb dick, right? Yeah. That's true.
5132360	5136280	Is it how big is the dick? How big is the dick? How big is the dragon's dick?
5140920	5145800	I really need to know. I'm really, I'm really crunching. I'm living in a world.
5145800	5152840	I'm taking this as soon as you are now. Breaking me down. Huh? Is it bigger than a bread box?
5152840	5156920	Yeah. It's numb. I'm small. Can I crawl up inside his dick hole?
5159400	5163960	I can kill him from the inside. I'll take my, I'll take my sword. I'll climb up his dick.
5164760	5171880	It's numb. He won't know. Can I squeeze in through the dick hole and get inside his abdomen and just
5171880	5177000	smash it and fucking. And I'm like, I should have thought of that. This is how I fight.
5177000	5182440	Is it too small for me to climb inside? Yeah. It's like, I mean,
5182440	5185800	maybe the size of an elephant, like you can't climb up an elephant's dick.
5185800	5189640	Yeah. What do you, how big do you think? What if I go up to his dick and I hold it
5189640	5195240	open and I have mole ring come behind me. I should have her shoot arrows into his dick hole.
5195240	5200600	What? I'm just, I'm trying to kill a dragon. That'd be exceedingly dangerous. But I mean,
5201400	5207000	maybe, maybe cool. I mean, technically it's possible to hold. Okay. I use it because I have
5207000	5212680	fast movement. I say mole rain. I'm going to run up using my fast, sneaky dwarf. Let me run this
5212680	5219480	by you. This is a tough sell. You don't have to do it. I'm taking all the risk here. I want you
5219480	5224600	just to get two of your favorite arrows handy and I'm going to run it real quick, grab his numb dick,
5224600	5228600	open it up and I'm going to aim it towards you. And I want you to shoot as many, as many arrows
5228600	5233880	as you can into his dick hole. Am I still hanging out by the dick? Be careful. Don't hit me.
5235480	5241480	Hit the dick. I'll agree to this. If only we can talk about what this means after.
5241480	5246200	I'm trying to kill a dragon. We can discuss it. This trying to make sense to me. All we've done
5246200	5249720	so far is numb this guy's dick. I'm taking advantage of a breach in the, in the, in the
5249720	5256920	armor right now. We've done all I've done. You've been trying to climb a statue. I'm trying to stand
5256920	5261560	on the shoulders of your hard work. Dude, we're all on the same team. All I'm saying is that I
5262120	5267400	quirk and, and Chris, this, we should examine this a little bit more afterwards. In an impetuous
5267400	5272680	known barbarian state of mind, I run up to say, just do what you want to do. I'm going to go open
5272680	5278120	that dick hole. And I run up and I grabbed, I grabbed the dragon's numb dick and I opened it
5278120	5284360	up and they aim it at her like a fire hose. And I go, shoot your arrows. Why would arrows,
5284360	5292440	why would arrows open it up? No, no, no, no. He opens it up. Oh, okay. The gesture you're making
5292440	5298280	is very flattering to the dragon. I don't know how big a dragon's dick is. I bet it's not as big as,
5298280	5302920	I mean, that's like a post office box. I don't know. What a weird, my dick looks weird. I,
5302920	5308920	I, my mind, I'm opening it up to mailbox size, the size of mailbox, right? Can you hit a mailbox?
5308920	5313400	Yeah. Hey, what's up, dude? I'm right next to the dick still. Hey, what are you doing? Oh,
5313480	5317720	Chris, step a little over to the side. Okay. Yeah, this is a bad place to be. Oh,
5317720	5322200	are you opening the dick hole to shoot arrows in? Yes. Oh, you're going for the number three. Yeah.
5326520	5331960	So I'm, I'm standing there holding a dragon's dick open. Okay. I bet you've never said that
5331960	5337560	sentence before. So before that quite happens, the dragon attacks.
5338520	5346200	Oh, you told me his dick was numb to Berg. Yeah. He did his attack you with his dick.
5347960	5352440	He has. I was, I was trying to, I didn't want to get into a big conversation. I wanted to use my
5352440	5355960	fast movement, open the dick, get an arrow in there and run the fuck over. I think we're all
5355960	5360440	safe here. Convened around his dick because God knows if a dragon could attack us here,
5360440	5372360	he wouldn't leave the house. Hey, oh, dungeon snap. Wait. So who does he attack? Probably me.
5372360	5380360	Well, he attacks Keith, you know, and he, okay. Let me just narrate this. We're okay with that.
5381000	5387320	Rearing back and striking with his front claw. He pins down the scorpion before biting its head
5387320	5391960	with his fearsome beak, ripping it from its shoulders. Do you, do scorpions have shoulders?
5391960	5396200	Yes. Ripping it from its shoulders. They got like eight. Yeah. They got a bunch of shoulders.
5396200	5400200	At the same time. Its survival instinct is terrible by the way. He's not going for the
5400200	5405160	guy opening his dick. Well, that hasn't, chronologically that hasn't happened yet.
5405160	5411800	Oh shit. It's yet to happen with both of his wings. He, he, uh, he flails them wildly and
5411800	5416840	his left wing catches Christoper right in the chin, knocking you off your feet onto your back.
5417480	5419080	My mouth is my fortune.
5426360	5431240	But now this is the perfect time. Christoper is now cleared out of the way. He's distracted with
5431240	5437000	it with scorpion shoulders. So now I've run up, opened up this call and cry out to Mulrane.
5437000	5441000	That wasn't me, you guys. I cry out to Mulrane to shoot some arrows into this dragon's dick,
5441000	5445240	for Pete's sake. Okay. So approaching the dragon, he points his beak at you and then
5445880	5452120	does something like a pack attack. How about, you know, rearing back like a cobra. He lunges
5452120	5458040	forward, striking you directly in the chest with his beak. It pings harmlessly off your armor
5458680	5462840	and you manage to position yourself right under his, uh, you know, dickle regions.
5464760	5470520	I think the dickle regions are just called dick positioning yourself strategically around the
5470520	5477400	dick. You force your hands into the opening, whiting the urethra. You call out to your
5477400	5484040	compatriot, Mulrane, who is somewhat conflicted by this whole thing. It seems it's fine. Okay.
5484040	5488120	Well, that was just what I'm reading off your face. Can I, can I ask how much did I get hurt?
5488120	5492360	You got hurt for, uh, what did I, I said five damage, right? Five or four damage. Four damage.
5492360	5495880	I mean, I'm just, I'm guessing, well, no, nevermind. I was gonna say the dumbest thing in the world.
5495880	5500280	I just, I can't help but just picture a giant penis. I was about to say I've had more
5500280	5503480	experience with penises than you guys have. That's retarded. You all have penises.
5503480	5508520	I experience one every day. How much experience do you have with my retarded sister?
5512040	5516600	All right, cliffhanger. We'll come back and see how we break that out.
5519160	5522200	Am I going to stand here holding a dragon's dick open for the rest of the day?
5522600	5525480	What can I shoot? Somebody shoot an arrow for pity's sake.
5527240	5531960	I, I shoot two V arrows into the dragon's urethra. Okay.
5533720	5536680	Now we're talking. Retardedly. Now we're playing D and D.
5536680	5540200	I don't get the connection. What are you talking about? Did somebody use that word?
5540840	5548680	Yeah. Oh, retarded. Oh, okay. We're supposed to be phasing that out. Yeah, yeah. No,
5548680	5552120	I don't like that term. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said retarded. Dan has-
5552120	5558440	Don't you keep saying it. Well, I meant, I meant retarded in a inefficient way.
5558440	5562920	Too many like gay. I meant, I meant, I meant that the devil
5562920	5565720	shows you because your parents committed a sin.
5565720	5570600	Genuinely, nothing is gayer than shooting an arrow into a dude's penis.
5572920	5577960	I'm very sorry. I said retarded. In my mind, I pictured this whole thing to go down a lot faster.
5577960	5582280	I didn't know that I would spend seven minutes holding a dragon's penis hole open.
5583560	5585960	Now I'm getting, it's getting a little gay over here.
5587480	5590760	I shot two, I shot two V arrows. Yeah, both of them missed.
5591480	5595160	Oh, you retired. We got a huge retard.
5597240	5602120	So I, I, I, uh, I, uh, I look up at the dragon and give him like a, sorry.
5603640	5607800	And I run back to my friends and be like, you guys did fucking a little less jibber jabber next time.
5607960	5612200	I take some gold coins and I, I put them in an envelope and I mailed them to the special Olympics.
5615800	5617080	I don't know how to get out of it.
5619640	5623320	Stop going back into it. Yeah. Our good ways to not talk about it anymore.
5624120	5626760	You're forgiven. Just let's keep going. It's fine.
5626760	5631320	I cast a spell to pro to protect myself from the awkwardness in this battle chamber.
5633000	5635720	I absolve everyone. I have a bubble.
5636680	5640520	Um, all right. So it's my turn. Yeah. Yeah. You've been knocked onto your feet.
5640520	5646200	So, you know, you, you have to get up before I get up. I walk over, I open, I hold it,
5646200	5651880	dickhole open and I yell at Mulwright. Try again. There we go. You can do it.
5654040	5660840	Approaching. No, no, no, I don't. Okay. I don't think she's on board. All right. Um, so I have
5660840	5668440	a, uh, I can, uh, short bow sap or what does sap do? A sap's like a blackjack. It's like, uh,
5668440	5674680	you know, like a donkey sock. Like a what? A donkey sock. What's a, what are these words?
5674680	5682440	Like, okay. So have you ever like filled, uh, like a bag with coins? Oh, it's really full of
5682440	5687800	like, uh, and then like, is it spiky? No, like it's just really heavy, but you can like, you can
5688760	5695160	knock something out with the back of the head with a blackjack, you know? Okay. Yeah. Oh, blackjack.
5695720	5701720	No, I don't know what, I don't know in this context what it means. Um, so I have a blackjack
5701720	5710280	that saps, uh, energy. No, it's just also called a sap. Oh guys, shut up. I, I use the blackjack on
5710280	5721240	the dick. Yeah. Oh, what are we going on here? You strike directly in the dick. However,
5721240	5726920	he doesn't seem to take notice as it is numb. Yes, but it hurts him, right? I mean, the sap does
5726920	5732760	non-lethal damage, so he can't feel it. So if you did it enough, eventually he'd go unconscious and
5732760	5742680	not know why. I do it enough. But you do do seven damage. So overall the dragon is hurt. He's, he's
5742680	5747880	been hurt. Yeah. Although he wouldn't know it. But seven, okay. The knowing is not important to me.
5747880	5752120	I'm not doing this because I want the dragon to know I'm attacking its dick over and over.
5752120	5759000	That is the last thing I want the dragon to know. That is why I numbed its dick. That was step one.
5759000	5765080	I don't want to announce to this dragon, hey, I have a bunch of things in my bag. I'm gonna pull
5765080	5772040	about one by one and I'm gonna strike your dick with this. You numbed its dick so you could hit it
5772040	5779800	with a bag filled with coins. Hey, that wasn't the first thing I did. I'm just looking in my bag. I
5779800	5784200	don't know what else I have. Some, some dragons pay a lot of money for this kind of stuff.
5784200	5792360	Am I causing the dragon any pleasure? Is that what kind of dungeon this is? This is like a weird
5792360	5798520	sex dungeon. Dungeons and dragons are just a bunch of, just a weird domination dungeon for dragons to
5798520	5806600	go to. Well it does say I'm a rogue, so. Have you ever googled dungeon master? It's pretty worse.
5806600	5816680	Uh, ready for my move? Oh yeah. Oh shit, I have like a wire saw and stuff. Oh yeah, yeah, like you
5816680	5823160	could uh cut a limb off a branch. Oh, you could probably saw his dick off. That'd take a while,
5823160	5827800	but yeah. I think someone said that from the back, which is one of those responses. Oh hey guys, I
5827800	5835160	think I got my next turn planned out. Here's what I'm doing, because I know what I'm doing and I've
5835160	5841400	seen a lot of movies where you're fighting an oversized beast. I'm casting the spell jump,
5842440	5848360	and I am leaping onto the dragon's back. Why? That's not where this dick is.
5850360	5858200	It's where, it's where my hero metal is. Oh, that's where the brain is. Yeah, there's lethal
5858200	5866600	parts of the body. It's time to get cinematic. All right. Jump. Casting jump on yourself. You
5866600	5873800	feel arcane energy swirling around your legs. You get the sensation that you can jump powerfully
5873800	5883320	for a time. I do so. Onto the back of the dragon. Yes. Heroically leaping up into the air. You land
5883400	5888840	cinematically on the back of the dragon successfully. For a bit you feel unsteady,
5888840	5893400	but then you catch yourself and you have sturdy footing. That guy's awesome.
5894920	5898120	That's way better than the laughing attack you did. Letterboxing appears.
5899720	5903320	Can I do more? Is that my whole turn? Yeah, that is your whole turn. Yeah.
5903320	5915320	I take my great sword and I throw it up to him so he can plunge this. You should tell him when
5915320	5923800	you're doing it. I say, look alive. And I throw it handle first up to a sharpie so he can plunge
5923800	5930600	my sword into the back of the spinal column like a coup de gras and a bull fight. But not before
5930600	5938120	the sluggishly poisoned dragon unleashes an acid line onto your party. It flows directly
5938120	5943080	into Quark's path as well as Moraine's path and you'll have to twist yourselves out of the way to
5943080	5948280	dodge. I have a good dodging ability, don't I? That's true. I can jump. I can dodge. I'm very
5948280	5958760	nimble. You can dodge. So yeah, but you didn't in this case. Sometimes it's just not your day.
5958760	5963000	Yeah, sometimes it's just not your day. I was two arrows, two arrows up a dick all the way from
5963000	5970680	finishing this thing. Two arrows at a dick, two girls won. Sometimes you numb and open up a dragon
5970680	5978760	dick. Sometimes a dragon dick opens up you. Oh yeah, we all grew up with that thing.
5980840	5987480	So Moraine takes 16 damage from the line of acid and his corrosive juices burn through her armor.
5987480	5994680	I know why. Because it's acid. Well, because I said retarded earlier. No, because
5994680	6003080	it happens, America. Is my awkwardness shield still up? Yeah, yeah. That's what they always,
6003080	6007560	that's a true standard of standards and practices thing. They go, it would go like, oh, can Annie
6007560	6011160	get, can she get drunk? And though she's underage and they're like, as long as she has a bad time.
6011800	6016520	Oh really? It's so crazy. Just let there be negative consequences to
6016520	6021240	their foolish act. That's like a lot of horror movie stuff that it's all very like morality.
6021240	6025000	Yeah. Can these two do it? Can you see your boobs? Yeah. If you murder them afterwards.
6027000	6033240	How many hit points do I take Spencer? You also take 16. Shit. I'm getting screwed over. By my
6033240	6038520	count, you're at 26. I think maybe you've got, no, you should have taken another eight damage,
6038520	6046040	right? So it should be 18. Yeah. I take a healing potion. Okay. Well you were gonna,
6046040	6049160	okay. So you could take a healing potion and throw the sword, but that's all you could do.
6049160	6054600	Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So swilling a healing potion in a single gulp and hurling
6054600	6061640	your sword directly at a Sharpie butts a lot. Shit. Critical. So yeah, you catch it and like,
6061640	6066440	you throw it in like a super dramatic manner and it's all slow motion style and it cuts to people
6066440	6073480	like looking at it, you know? Right. And it totally lands perfectly in your hand. In my hand. Oh. And
6073480	6079240	there's almost like energy kind of like, you know, surrounding this whole epic situation as it lands
6079240	6085880	directly into your hand perfectly. And also you gain 14 hit points. So he gains back 14 hit points.
6087880	6092840	But also you have the thing now. Yeah. So you got my sword now. Use it Jackson. Well, is it my turn?
6092840	6100840	It's yours, right? Let's see. Well, first of all, I'm sorry about saying retarded.
6101720	6106760	I was just joking. The arrows just, I know, but I don't know. Is this a joke on bad? It happens
6106760	6110040	all the time. Yeah. I'm going to go on a message board and there's going to be a
6110040	6117160	Photoshop on my face covered in blood. I don't know. Um, I'm not asking for that, by the way. Uh,
6117160	6123240	too late. Okay. I take, sorry. It's already happening. Yeah. It's already, if you go to
6123240	6128520	YouTube, it'll be there. I'm sure this is very annoying, but it's clear that I'm sorry. I don't
6128520	6133800	mean it. You've, you've paid your penance. It was a joke. I know. The language is garbage.
6134600	6137560	Sounds that come out of people's mouths. I know one hates the idea that you can't say
6137560	6143640	retarded more than me. I was doing a bit. I, I did it. I did that to you. I'm sorry. I got my,
6143640	6149320	I got my shitty retarded joke all over you. I'm sorry. Like that was my bit that didn't land and
6149320	6155720	made your plane crash. I imagine you doing that to bother you with a sword in your hand. So I take,
6155720	6170680	I take two, uh, V arrows. Sure. And I shoot them at the dragon. I sh what? Don't. All right. Sorry.
6170680	6175480	I thought you were whispering at me at him. Okay. I take two V arrows and I shoot them
6175480	6182200	at the dragon's head in his head. He's right there. Right. But I can't handle my arrows.
6182200	6187800	No, but I want to make sure you don't, don't hit him. I guess I'm too reliant on my skill.
6187800	6194200	I shoot them at the, at the, at the dragon's belly. At the dragon's belly, huh? Or his heart.
6195320	6201160	At his heart, huh? You said earlier that the dragon's organs are different from regular
6201160	6206200	organs. Yeah. They have like, you know, they got like, you know, numb dicks. This one has acid
6206200	6211640	bladders, you know, to hold acid so he could spit it out. You know, you don't have that.
6212520	6219000	They're different. It's different. Anyway, arrows hit both of them hit. Um, you deal 13 damage
6219000	6225160	altogether, striking them directly in the neck with both arrow shots. He's a bit, he's a bit
6225160	6229320	woozy right now. He's gotta be on the ropes. We've been kicking this guy. Dragons are tough,
6229320	6237000	you guys. Yeah, I know. Okay. Yeah. Um, all right. Christopher. It also says I have a bear trap,
6237000	6243080	like in cartoons. Yeah. Like, see, because your character is also like a
6243080	6246600	trapsman. Yeah, traps and stuff. I can throw that thing on the deck.
6249720	6254760	It seems so obvious now. You guys watch this. Yeah.
6254760	6263000	Yeah. He's not gonna feel it. And I have a great singer. Yeah. All right. More like dick trap.
6266120	6274200	I can only write songs. Right. Song. But it doesn't. Your bear drop trap goes off as expected.
6274200	6281560	Grinnin' Barrett. That's it. That's a good one. Oh God. That's grizzly. Um,
6282840	6290280	of me too. Yeah. It's quite grizzly of me too. Um, uh, that doesn't feel like honey.
6292760	6298120	You're really dragging it out. Yeah. Yeah. Hey boo boo.
6298120	6307880	Boo boo boo. I got a boo boo on my neck. Geez Louise. Yeah. So the bear trap works as intended.
6308680	6314280	Um, it finishes the job that your poison, you know, dagger started. Wait. Okay. I have a quick
6314280	6320600	question. Yeah. Does this mean, is this like, am I helping it by severing the organ that is poisoned?
6320600	6325240	Yes. Well, at this point, the poison would have already worked its way into the system. But,
6325240	6330040	but I mean, you, you, there's not more dick poison going to go into him. Definitely not.
6330040	6332120	Yeah. I mean, you could have thrown it in his mouth and maybe like, well,
6333080	6334760	guys have good news and bad news.
6338280	6346360	Does anybody want like a dragon? I put it in my sack just, just in case. Yeah. You know,
6346360	6354040	they got the magical, magical dicks. If you're in the market for a dragon, there's an old legend
6354040	6359720	that if severed dragon penises are really good at helping you write songs. Yeah. Yeah.
6363240	6370840	But you have to put it in your mouth. This won't be the first one I've put in my mouth.
6372440	6376840	Yeah. That's amazing. That is a legend, right? It's a legend. All right. So Sharpie,
6376840	6381240	it's your turn. Please go. You're up. You got my sword. I got a sword. You still,
6381240	6385720	you're still carrying the dramatic motion of the toss that comes to you. And everything goes
6385720	6395320	quiet. And then you go, father. And then thrust down. Did he just said father? Yeah, he just said father.
6395320	6404520	Fuck. I don't think he's slaying that dragon. Planting the blade directly between the dragons
6404520	6409080	have shoulders, everything has shoulders between the shoulder blades of the dragon's back. The
6409080	6423080	blade slices cleanly through the spinal cord and the dragon goes limp. Wow. This really puts my
6423080	6431640	dick strategy into question. My mother judged me in the bathtub. What? What? What? You had a break
6431640	6442120	through. I must have dreamt something. Yeah. Yeah. Is the dragon alive? No, it's dead. I go up and
6442920	6451800	it's dead. We killed the dragon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I take one of my burnt sticks and draw
6451800	6457960	dicks and balls all over the dragon's face. I draw swastikas on his balls and dicks on his face.
6458200	6464120	All right. You're ruining the market value of that dragon hide. Oh, shit. I don't give a fuck
6464120	6469320	for dragon. Oh, dragon hides marketable. Well, yeah. Everything dragon is marketable. Oh,
6469320	6476680	including what I got. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Camille, everybody. Aaron McGathey,
6479240	6483880	Spencer, and that's not even a cliffhanger. We just laid a dragon.
6484120	6487640	That's how you do it. Well done, sir.
6489400	6493400	Krista Berg, I doubted your tactics, but you know, all's well that ends well.
6495720	6499720	Send your letters to Aaron McGathey and I hate retarded people dot com.
6500840	6505080	Which is a weird email address for her to pay. I know. It seems like she was asking for it.
6505800	6511640	But it's also a weird place to send emails. Yeah, so it's a website. There's a contact page on that.
6511640	6517320	Why did you come here if you didn't expect to get offended? That's another problem with the
6517320	6520920	internet culture. People seeking out offense. All right, Dan, we've gone long. Let's bring this
6520920	6525320	fucker into the station. What do you think? I'm doing on a dime. On a dime. Yeah. Ten cents.
6525320	6527400	Ten cents? Straight up. What do you want, Herman?
6530680	6535480	Give me something sexy. You want something sexy? Yep. All right. You got something for us? No.
6535480	6542040	When did I ever have something? I sat on it for two hours. Now I have something? I don't know.
6542040	6545800	Do you want to connect with the crowd first? Do you want to just say goodnight? You want to bid
6545800	6549960	these people a fond farewell? Well, how do you connect with them by talking to them? They're
6549960	6554600	all sleepy. Like if I go, what's your name, sir? And I'll go, Leonard. And I'll go, what's your
6554600	6563960	problem? And he'll go, I'm sleepy. I live in Rancho salad. Did anybody here particularly
6563960	6567720	feel like they learned something or take something away from tonight? Does anybody
6567720	6572040	feel like they've grown as a person? Anybody got a big, big, big, big problem that you came in here
6572040	6577400	with that you really need solved? See, that takes a lot of guts and fortitude for them to like,
6577400	6581320	there's, they're stonewalling us. They're like, no, the show's over. Get out of here.
6582360	6586440	That's good. We had a, we had a perfect, perfect little, little show. We just need to.
6586440	6594920	Does it have to be long? Just just make it short and sweet. Put a little cherry
6594920	6598600	on top of this beautiful Sunday we've created for these people. Okay. All right.
6603720	6613080	I killed a dragon with you. We fought a monster or two. We're gonna do it in Harmon town.
6617240	6619400	We watched horror movies.
6622280	6627880	Stupid. I don't like this. You know, the problem with that song that it's the whole tour, it's like,
6627880	6634600	I don't like the structure of the, because it's you wait for the beat and then, and then the thing,
6634600	6639000	and then it picks up. I don't know how to articulate the, the corner that they don't articulate that
6639000	6646360	singer. I'm trying to tell you that I can't to that song. Don't tell me you can't sing,
6646360	6651560	sing, but you can't to that song. Okay. Okay. All right. Fight through it, man.
6652760	6661000	Weird to sing to a song that doesn't have a beginning or end. Now it's going quiet for a second.
6661960	6669720	It's just my job to have to reckon with it in Harmon town. And it doesn't, you don't,
6669720	6677160	there's no, it doesn't, there's nothing to do with the song. Everything comes out wrong.
6677160	6684600	You're still creating a song. Sometimes the limitations of the genre liberate the creative
6684680	6695800	mind. Yo, I fucked your mama at five. Use the limitations. Her pussy gave me the jive to carry on
6697480	6704840	in Harmon town. I fucked your mama a lot. I made her cry. It's not.
6706600	6711480	She looked sick to the neighborhood. They brought her in and said,
6714600	6722600	fart corner. Fart corner. We're going to end at a fart corner. Fart corner. Fart corner. Yeah.
6724600	6732280	Fart. Fart. Fart corner. Yeah. Break down. Mama's in the kitchen. Fuck your mama said,
6732280	6738120	stop that bitch and put my dick in her eye and her mouth. Northwest, south, south, south.
6738920	6742280	Fuck your mama on the floor. Fuck your mama like Eva Gabor.
6742840	6748360	Fuck your mama in the attic, in the basement. Fuck your mama said, this is a case that's closed.
6749640	6754280	Fuck your mama like sisters and bros. Fuck your mama up and down the street.
6754280	6758760	Fuck your mama with my hand and my feet. Fuck your mama on a big snowplow.
6758760	6763160	Fuck your mama and I don't know how. It boggles me. I tried to figure it out.
6763160	6767720	Fuck your mama, but I don't have the clout. Went to city hall, asked the mayor,
6767720	6772680	can I fuck your mama? He said, she's over there. Went over to her, fucked her again.
6772680	6778840	Fuck your mama. Eight, nine, ten. Fuck your mama up in the air. Fuck your mama, I don't care.
6779480	6785080	Fuck your mama, cut my hair. Fuck your mama, dragon's lair. Fuck your mama.
6785080	6787400	Thank you for coming to Hermitown, everybody. We did it again.
6789800	6794120	One more time for Spencer Crittenden, please. Erin McGathey, Camille Nantiani.
6794920	6799560	Everybody here at Meltdown Comics, Brian W. Collins and Horror Movie of the Day.
