382820	383820	Been drinking since the day began.
383820	384820	Been drinking since the day began.
384820	389700	You had the presence of mind to know you were taking aggression out on her that was
389700	391980	based on someone stealing your book bag?
391980	399020	She felt like it really didn't matter what the reason was, but she was her fucking house.
399020	403340	I don't know why you're upset with me, but I can tell you this, I saw your bitch ass
403340	406580	run home today.
406580	410140	So whatever's going on, you'll need to talk to me like that because I'm sure you can't
410140	411140	back it up.
411140	413820	I used to wipe your ass, bitch.
414820	418820	Allow for that to happen in your relationship.
418820	423620	Did your mom ever give you this one where you're like, did you ever come home like sniffling
423620	430220	and crying because you got bullied and did your mom go like, well, if they're that mean
430220	435220	then they, you don't want them as your friend.
435220	436220	You fucking bitch.
436220	440860	It was just like, it was like, it's so true.
440860	445540	It's so perfectly right, but it's not the message you're willing to receive at that
445540	446540	time.
446540	447540	No.
447540	450220	They're so mean to me.
450220	453500	Well then they're not good people and you don't want to hang out with them.
453500	454500	Yeah.
454500	458660	Well, that doesn't mean being in their tree house wouldn't be rad.
458660	459660	Right.
459660	460660	Right.
460660	463540	That doesn't cause fucking society, bitch.
463540	464540	Yeah.
464540	469100	Your advice doesn't raise my self esteem, mom.
469100	470100	Shrob's next t-shirt.
470100	475060	Where the fuck is Shrob?
475060	476700	You lost him on the way here.
476700	478100	His big, his biggest dream.
478100	486140	Oh, the episode where Shrob's gone, everyone misses Shrob and I miss him too.
486140	490780	Who's going to find the good chair and move it into place?
490780	495820	I sat down with, there's no, there's no guest per se.
495820	500940	I think I heard a possible guest respond to that.
500940	506340	But I sat down here cause they, there's a camera situation where the worst, I don't
506340	515740	know, like me standing up there is not good for camera purposes, whereas this is amazing.
515740	516900	Me sitting here is amazing.
516900	519140	Well, just look at the composition.
519140	522220	But let's, let's, let's, let's bring on our friend, Nick Rutherford.
522220	523220	Nick.
523940	524940	Nick Rutherford.
524940	529500	Ladies and gentlemen, you don't from such shows as the Nick Rutherford show written
529500	536580	and produced by Nick Rutherford, sorry, all right, Rutherford, what?
536580	537580	Yeah.
537580	541660	Ladies and gentlemen, his entrance tonight is brought to you by lime, lime scooters.
541660	544340	You're going to, you're going to bust your mouth open.
544340	545340	Lime scooters.
545340	546340	Oh my God.
546340	547340	Wow.
547340	548340	Man.
548340	549340	Subtle.
549580	550580	Subtle.
552260	553340	That was good.
553340	554340	I saw that.
554340	557380	I saw the headlight on that thing coming down the thing and I was like, we're all going
557380	558380	to die.
566100	571460	Oh, for the folks at home, Nick wrote a scooter up on stage and then had to turn it off so
571460	573060	he didn't keep getting billed for the show.
573060	574060	Yeah.
574060	575060	He locked it.
575060	576060	Very expensive.
576060	577060	So frustrating.
577300	581260	So you knew, you're, you're, you're facile enough with these things that you knew it
581260	584140	would make a punchline sound when you deactivated it.
584140	585140	I love limes, man.
585140	586140	They're the best.
586140	588380	People who rail against limes are, are awful.
588380	589380	Yeah, man.
589380	590380	That's what I'm saying.
590380	593460	I think they're a little too curmudgeon-y, like, yeah.
593460	595140	The people or the limes?
595140	596380	The people.
596380	598100	I think limes are too curmudgeon-ly.
598100	601820	Also, it's only people who live in Santa Monica and fuck that place, right?
601820	602820	Yeah.
603620	608500	Anything, like, any critique people have of these scooters is the same about bikes, but
608500	612260	no one said them about bikes because bikes are old and adults use them.
612260	613860	Okay, boomer.
613860	614860	Okay, boomer.
614860	615860	Oh, shit.
615860	616860	Oh, shit.
616860	617860	Oh, shit.
617860	618860	Okay, boomer.
618860	619860	This phrase, like...
619860	620860	I can do it too, boomer.
620860	621860	Oh, shit.
621860	624580	I also know how to use the phrase of the day, boomer.
624580	625580	Okay.
625580	626580	I saw...
626580	631380	This phrase has exploded like a fucking wad of shitty cum everywhere.
632100	633100	Okay, boomer.
633100	636380	Oh, he fucking got your ass.
636380	639940	Nailed your ass to the fucking wall.
639940	640940	I saw...
640940	641940	Wait, what is that?
641940	642940	What is that?
642940	643940	I celebrate.
643940	649180	I celebrate when I say it, boomer.
649180	651700	You know demographically, Brandon, you're my age.
651700	656420	I'm sorry to out you, but like, we're Generation X.
656420	657420	You and I.
657420	658420	That's right, yeah.
658420	659420	We're the little one.
659420	663860	Did you know demographically what that means is that we have no voice?
663860	666380	We don't, but all the shit's made for us right now.
666380	667380	What?
667380	668380	No, you're thinking it's 1995.
668380	669380	It's true.
669380	670380	No, no, it's true.
670380	671380	Oh.
671380	672380	True.
672380	673380	It's all made for us.
673380	674380	What do you mean?
674380	675380	We're in that sweet spot where it's like...
675380	676380	What?
676380	677380	People market to us.
677380	678380	All the music and shit is for us.
678380	679380	Like The Morning Show.
679380	680380	No, I don't...
680380	681380	Like The Morning Show.
681380	682380	No, I don't...
682380	683380	Disney Plus is made for you guys.
683380	684380	That's true.
684380	685380	What is made for us?
685380	686380	There's nothing made for us.
686380	687380	I don't...
687420	689420	What is like probiotics?
689420	690420	Okay, all right.
690420	691420	Oh, yeah.
691420	692420	Activity is huge.
692420	693420	My point was gonna be...
693420	698060	I mean, I would love to think what you're saying is true, but my point is that like
698060	701340	demographically, when you examine it, the baby boomers...
701340	702340	Okay, boomer.
702340	705900	Those are my parents, Brandon's parents, okay?
705900	706900	That was a generation.
706900	708220	They're called baby boomers.
708220	713380	Let me walk you through this, because it's Veterans Day.
713380	719820	My grandpappies came back from Guadalcanal and did so much fucking that they created
719820	723420	the Beatles with their dicks.
723420	727460	They're just like, holy fuck, I'm so fucking horny, I've just been like bayoneting the
727460	731020	enemy forever, and I can't wait to fuck.
731020	737340	And so there was this baby boom, and that's our fucking obnoxious Trump generation is
737340	738340	the fucking...
738340	740780	These boomers, they're like, I want a trivial pursuit.
740780	743020	By the way, Nick, how are you?
743020	744020	I'm great, man.
744020	745020	I've been liming.
745020	746020	Okay.
746020	747320	Sorry, I'm a bad interviewer, a bad host.
747320	749700	You said you don't have a guest, per se.
749700	750700	Yeah.
750700	756700	Well, I didn't wanna...
756700	757700	Per se.
757700	758700	I'm sorry.
758700	762900	So, like, did you forget, or you don't consider me a guest?
762900	766660	It's the biggest problem I can bear you, I'm like, you're my friend.
766660	767660	Don't tell him that.
767660	768660	I don't have any friends.
768660	769660	Damn.
770660	771660	I don't have any friends.
771660	772660	Damn.
772660	774860	I don't know what I'm doing.
774860	778900	Don't let me fucking do that to you.
778900	779900	I'm sorry.
779900	780900	I'm your friend, Dan.
780900	788940	Anyways, the baby boomers had a couple of kids, like three of them total, me, Kurt Cobain,
788940	789940	and Brandon.
789940	797620	Paul F. Tompkins, David Cross, Janine Gravelow, okay, yeah, that's us.
797620	802760	We didn't have any kids, because we're fucking awesome.
802760	803760	We were like...
803760	805260	Trying to save that planet.
805260	806260	Yeah.
806260	808620	Trying to impact that waste.
808620	810140	And we were like, Disney?
810140	813260	Oh, think so.
813260	814260	Coca-Cola?
814260	816260	Uh-uh.
816260	817260	Anything corporate?
817260	818880	No, uh-uh.
818880	822160	You think you're into the Bernie or whatever, like, fuck you.
822160	826260	We were like socialist before we knew it was called socialism.
826260	828700	We were like, fucking fuck you, dude.
828700	832220	Hands in the pockets, Alanis Morissette.
832220	835340	Give me a fucking peace sign, and I'm playing the piano over here.
835340	838980	They don't know about Nader.
838980	841260	I thought you said something else.
841260	842260	Oh, no.
842260	845660	I was like, it's the hard R on the Nader, man.
845660	851700	Yeah, no, they don't know about no Nader.
851700	854460	My first vote was 1992.
854460	857500	I was 18 years old, voted for a guy named Ross Perot.
857500	860060	My parents voted for Ross Perot.
860060	865660	Felicia Day in her book talks about that was her first vote.
865660	866660	It was like...
866660	867660	Yeah, anyways.
867660	872980	Like, here's the thing, Generation X, sandwich, real little sliver, if you were to represent
872980	877220	demographically population-wise, we're just outnumbered.
877220	878500	Our parents...
878500	882380	We have 1,000 parents and 1,000 cousins that are younger than us.
882460	887660	I don't know how that worked, but even though we didn't have kids, we now...
887660	892940	If you're Generation X, you're just a fucking piece of shit sandwiched between...
892940	894980	Fuck everybody, man.
894980	896460	But we were nailing it.
896460	898060	By doing what?
898060	899060	Nothing.
899060	900060	Yeah.
900060	901060	What are you talking about?
901060	902060	We gave them...
902060	903060	Hip-hop.
903060	904060	Hip-hop.
904060	905060	Hip-hop.
905060	906060	We had hip-hop.
906060	907060	Yeah, we did hip-hop.
907060	909620	You guys came up with hip-hop?
909620	911820	Brandon and Dan, you came up with hip-hop.
911820	912820	Cable.
912820	913820	Cable.
913820	914820	Cable.
914820	915820	Cable.
915820	916820	Cable.
916820	919500	You motherfuckers was getting free TV.
919500	922820	Our generation came and said, pay for these reruns.
922820	924820	Cable.
924820	927260	Fuck shit.
927260	928260	Generation X...
928260	929260	Yeah.
929260	933740	There were three channels when we were born, and then when we were 20, we were like, there
933740	935020	should be 300.
935020	936020	Yeah.
936020	937020	We did that.
937020	938020	We did that.
938020	940060	We added value to everything.
940060	941060	Yeah.
941300	942300	You're using one home phone?
942300	943300	Fuck that.

1172460	1174460	I saw some bus bench ads for that
1174460	1175460	Pretty good
1175460	1183460	Yeah, Adult Swim really tried to promote DreamCorp LLC by having really cool ads that didn't say what DreamCorp LLC was
1183460	1186460	Right, it was like, that's great, I've been having sleeping problems lately
1186460	1188460	Maybe I should go to these guys
1188460	1189460	Yeah, it's like, no, it's a TV show
1189460	1190460	Oh, never mind, man
1191460	1199460	It was like, they did really subversive, like, it was like a picture of John Grice who plays Dr. Roberts
1199460	1206460	And it said like, oh, we will analize your dreams, and it's a fun anal pun
1206460	1207460	That's fun
1207460	1210460	Yeah, but then everybody was like, look at that dumb billboard
1210460	1214460	They spaced their text wrong, and then nobody watched the show
1215460	1219460	When I was doing Community, which I never bring up
1221460	1224460	There was, I wanted to, I was like so excited about the website
1224460	1228460	I was like, I want to do the Greendale College, Greendale?
1228460	1229460	Yeah, Greendale
1230460	1233460	I'm like, is it Glendale or Greendale? No, Greendale
1234460	1241460	I want to do the Greendale College's website, and I want it to be like, it's got to be legit
1241460	1246460	It's got to be like the Dunder Mifflin website, but beyond that
1246460	1248460	It's going to be this fully immersive thing
1248460	1252460	We're going to have hundreds and hundreds of student registries and other things
1252460	1257460	And then it was like, NBC Digital was like, yeah, but we did research
1257460	1263460	And we did that Dunder Mifflin page, and people were upset
1263460	1270460	Because what we found in our testing is that they wanted to know whether it was a real website or not
1271460	1277460	And so what we found is if we put like a Toyota ad, it made people more comfortable
1280460	1284460	I mean, it sounds like I'm complaining, but I'm not, I'm just laughing
1286460	1290460	We did the, I'm sorry, I've been drinking since 10am
1290460	1293460	Wait, so you never got a community college website?
1293460	1297460	No, we never really, it was like, well, there was like a, there was a website, but it was like
1297460	1304460	Sony.com slash community slash NBC dot hashtag slash this is a TV show slash
1304460	1312460	We promise this isn't really happening slash dot org slash TV dot biz slash Toyota
1312460	1320460	Like, oh, just for funsies, let's pretend this is a community college dot, just for fun dot, just kidding
1320460	1326460	dot com, and it was like, it was nothing, it was like, let's go through the motions and hated it
1326460	1332460	And then we would do like Twitter, I was like, let's do a Twitter episode where we have the characters talking to each other
1332460	1338460	And they're like, that's great, just make sure that every character after everything they tweet, they hashtag
1338460	1344460	NBC underscore community, watch it at eight, why would, why would Annie Edison be saying that?
1345460	1349460	Anyways, those guys all got mad at me one time on Twitter or something, they were all like adding me
1349460	1356460	The cast of community? Yeah, the characters from community? Yeah, like Abed's tweets or whatever
1356460	1357460	That would probably be me
1357460	1361460	It was, it was someone, it was just someone who was like, oh, this could be fun
1361460	1363460	Before we met, I was yelling at you as Abed on Twitter?
1363460	1367460	No, this was after, it was after, it was way, it was way later than those accounts were like active
1367460	1372460	Like they went rogue or something, like the people were like RPing them and they just like, you know, lost reality or something
1373460	1377460	For a while those were all me, they had to be, because you couldn't, you couldn't make writers do that stuff
1377460	1379460	Who's doing it now then?
1379460	1381460	The guy who hates you
1381460	1382460	Yeah
1382460	1387460	We did the Vulture, Vulture fest, we did the community reunion panel
1387460	1389460	Was anyone at that?
1389460	1396460	Yeah, it was, it was basically everyone, pretty much at the risk of offending anyone that I'm forgetting
1396460	1401460	Yeah, it was basically everyone minus Donald and Chevy on the panel
1401460	1409460	And, and then we went to this dinner in the basement of this steak place that Joel loves
1409460	1412460	And in the middle of the dinner, fucking Donald Glover walks in
1412460	1420460	It was so fantastic to see him with his fucking crazy beard and his like, like, like, God dammit, I'm jealous of that guy
1421460	1424460	Did he know about the dinner or does he work at that steak place?
1424460	1429460	I think he was like, he's trying to make ends meet
1429460	1437460	He, I think he was literally coming, got off, I think he was trying to make the panel and only made it, like, just to the dinner
1437460	1440460	But it was just, it was just good to talk to him again
1440460	1447460	Did he, were you guys having a dinner and he just happened to be in the same place at the same time or did he know you guys were going to be there?
1447460	1451460	No, he, that's what I'm saying, like, I think he was, I think he was literally coming from Atlanta
1451460	1456460	Figuratively and literally, like, like, or literally and literally
1457460	1461460	And, and he just, the flight didn't work out
1461460	1464460	But he just made it to the dinner
1464460	1466460	Did Chevy show up at all?
1466460	1469460	No, yeah, no, he didn't make it
1471460	1473460	Well, you should give his phone number out
1473460	1474460	Yeah
1478460	1480460	I think they would like his phone number, right?
1480460	1482460	I bet they'd love it, yeah
1484460	1488460	You should get hired, like, after people go through rehab, you should be like the tester
1490460	1493460	We should get one more drink, right? We should just do more, one more line, right?
1493460	1498460	In, in, informal poll, does anyone answer their phone anymore?
1499460	1500460	Someone said yes
1500460	1501460	Sometimes, yeah
1501460	1502460	Who said yes?
1503460	1504460	A liar
1504460	1506460	Me, Fred answer phone
1507460	1508460	Someone said yes, right?
1509460	1510460	Yeah, Boomer
1510460	1512460	Oh, no, oh, no
1512460	1515460	Like, I, like, who, why would you ever answer your phone anymore?
1515460	1518460	I don't think we even need the actual phone call function anymore
1518460	1524460	I don't, I, yeah, I don't, I think, someone's calling me, even if it says mom, I'm like, yeah, right
1525460	1526460	Nice try
1526460	1528460	Well, you don't think it's your mom, or?
1529460	1530460	I just
1530460	1531460	Nice try
1531460	1532460	I just assumed
1532460	1533460	My own contacts
1533460	1535460	Yeah, exactly, I'm like, good one, AT&T
1536460	1538460	Uh, Nick, what'd you do last night?
1539460	1542460	Oh, we went to, uh, the Rick and Morty premiere last night
1543460	1544460	Yeah
1544460	1545460	Oh, shit
1545460	1546460	It's back
1546460	1547460	Wubble, wubble, dub, dub
1547460	1549460	Did you guys like that episode?
1550460	1552460	Who said no? Nobody
1554460	1555460	Okay, good
1555460	1556460	It was, uh, very fun, Brandon
1556460	1557460	Did you like it?
1557460	1558460	Yeah
1558460	1559460	Did I like the episode?
1559460	1562460	Did you like, uh, uh, how'd you feel, was this your second one? First one?
1562460	1569460	Uh, this is my first premiere, I don't care for the show itself, but I do, like, um, just hanging out with friends, so, yeah, it was nice
1569460	1571460	It's great, it's great, there was food, there was food
1572460	1575460	Brandon was in the Raiders room for a while
1575460	1576460	It's great
1576460	1588460	The time on that show moves so slowly that the episode that you inspired, which I will, we will call the Vat of Acid episode, like, you gotta see the fucking finished product on that
1589460	1590460	It's an amazing episode
1590460	1591460	I cannot wait to see it
1591460	1592460	Yeah, it's gonna be live action
1592460	1594460	That's a good room, man
1594460	1598460	Can you imagine? You guys know, it's, uh, it's fucking hilarious in there
1598460	1600460	It's a fun room, they have a good time
1600460	1601460	Rob's in there
1601460	1602460	Rob is in there
1602460	1604460	Sometimes there's a dog in there
1604460	1607460	There's a lot, there's two dogs in there, constantly
1607460	1608460	Let's talk about them
1608460	1610460	Well, one's a little angel
1610460	1611460	That's Tilda
1611460	1612460	That's Tilda
1612460	1615460	There's a dog named Tilda, just think of a cute dog
1616460	1617460	That's kinda what it is
1617460	1619460	It's about the size of this microphone
1620460	1628460	I think that I'm having a lot of trouble, I think one thing, because, like, last night I was, like, blackout drunk and I, like, went wandering around
1630460	1634460	I have video of you and I holding hands prancing downtown
1635460	1638460	Yeah, I guess you were just, like, wrangling me or something
1638460	1639460	I, I, I
1639460	1640460	No, I don't know
1640460	1642460	We were just wanted to prance
1642460	1645460	Tilda were screaming at me in the photo booth and then there's a picture of it
1645460	1647460	I screamed at you
1648460	1650460	It was not, it was friendly, it was great
1650460	1651460	Not sincerely, okay
1651460	1652460	It was great
1652460	1655460	But it was right as the first picture got taken
1655460	1657460	So you're sort of like, ha!
1657460	1659460	And I'm like, ah!
1660460	1662460	I was truly blackout drunk
1662460	1663460	So much fun
1663460	1666460	And I think part of, maybe, like, I don't know, I don't want to be, like, a drama queen
1666460	1671460	But I just, I also want to be, like, honest and, like, try to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me
1671460	1675460	What am I going through, why am I in this weird state
1675460	1679460	You know, we had our producer friend Mike who passed away
1679460	1684460	And, like, his wife was there at the premiere
1684460	1688460	And I think, I think maybe that, like, set me off
1688460	1689460	I don't know
1689460	1692460	That just seems like something that a fucking horrible drunk uses as an excuse
1692460	1698460	Like, I, but, you know, Jewel, like, as I've said here before
1698460	1703460	She was the casting director on the first thing that Rob Schraub and I ever did for TV
1703460	1705460	Three decades ago or something
1705460	1709460	And it was just pure coincidence that her husband was the line producer of Rick and Morty
1709460	1712460	And then, and then I hadn't seen her since the funeral
1712460	1714460	And she was there at the premiere
1714460	1719460	And I just, like, I can't, I just, I feel
1719460	1723460	I texted her today, like
1723460	1726460	Like, can you have a drink with me
1726460	1728460	And she's like, no, I'm at work
1728460	1730460	And I'm like
1730460	1733460	I don't, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like
1733460	1736460	I keep, I keep doing it wrong with this
1736460	1741460	Like, I, like, like, she was robbed of her husband
1741460	1745460	And I, I just have this shame
1745460	1747460	Like, I'm just filled with shame about it
1747460	1750460	Because I feel like
1750460	1755460	We take people from their private lives and we use them in TV
1755460	1757460	And then it's like, it was for nothing
1757460	1761460	And as Justin said to me recently, it was like
1761460	1765460	Do you think that if Mike knew
1765460	1769460	That it was gonna end that way, that he would have shown up for a day of this shit
1769460	1772460	The answer is obviously no, not at all, of course not
1772460	1774460	Like, what the fuck, but I don't even know
1774460	1778460	And then to see her there was like, what the fuck are we doing
1778460	1779460	And I don't, I, I
1779460	1780460	It's super hard, man
1780460	1782460	And it's really hard to make sense of it
1782460	1785460	But I don't know if it's like, is this me grieving
1785460	1786460	Yep
1786460	1787460	You sound so sure of it
1787460	1788460	I don't, I don't, I don't like it
1788460	1790460	Well, I mean, you know, I've grieved
1790460	1791460	If that's what it is
1791460	1792460	You've grieved?
1792460	1793460	You've grieved?
1793460	1794460	I've grieved
1794460	1795460	You haven't grieved, Brandon
1795460	1796460	I've grieved
1796460	1797460	Fuck you, you piece of shit
1797460	1798460	I love you
1798460	1804460	And that's how, that's, that's the way it works
1804460	1805460	It sucks
1805460	1806460	Who, who have you lost them?
1806460	1807460	I'm an orphan, you know
1807460	1808460	Oh, you lost both your parents?
1808460	1810460	Yeah, you brought them up earlier in the show
1810460	1815460	You mean when I wrapped that I fucked your mama?
1816460	1817460	That's colloquially
1817460	1818460	Did you fuck my mama?
1818460	1819460	Brandon, no
1819460	1821460	I'm a very special
1827460	1828460	Brandon
1830460	1831460	Your mama
1831460	1833460	Oh, god damn
1833460	1834460	I fucked her
1834460	1835460	Oh
1835460	1836460	All right, it's a
1836460	1837460	It's a specific
1837460	1839460	It's all right, cut it, cut it, sorry, I'm sorry
1839460	1840460	But it
1840460	1841460	It's not funny
1841460	1844460	But it is super, it is super hard to see
1844460	1846460	You have a survivor's guilt, part of it
1846460	1849460	And then it's super hard to see the passage of time
1849460	1850460	When you lose somebody
1850460	1854460	You see that other people that loved them at a function like that
1854460	1856460	And you naturally look for Mike in that room
1856460	1859460	There's survivor's guilt and then there's murderer's guilt
1859460	1861460	Well, you shouldn't have murdered him
1861460	1862460	Yeah
1862460	1863460	Yeah
1863460	1866460	I feel like I took him away from his family
1866460	1869460	He, remember that he went on a trip right before
1869460	1870460	Yeah
1870460	1871460	And he had spent time
1871460	1872460	Glad he got to spend time
1872460	1873460	Yeah, I know
1873460	1876460	He was a great family man, great husband, great father
1876460	1880460	Yeah, I took as much of that away as I could
1880460	1883460	And for nothing
1883460	1884460	For nothing
1884460	1885460	Like
1885460	1888460	Some people may say that the fact that he was great at his job
1888460	1890460	Made him a better family man
1890460	1891460	I, yeah
1891460	1892460	Yeah, no
1892460	1897460	You may have provided like a full universe for a person to express themselves fully
1897460	1900460	If you looked at that room last night
1900460	1901460	That's what you saw
1901460	1905460	Is that there's a room full of people who are standing around all agreeing
1905460	1907460	And that's what you've created
1907460	1911460	So the fact that Mike was a part of that, a massive part of that
1911460	1913460	Is amazing
1913460	1915460	And it super sucks that he's gone
1915460	1918460	Yeah, I'm sorry but I don't mean to like
1918460	1921460	Fucking draw it out and all this stuff
1921460	1924460	But I want to get to the bottom of it
1924460	1928460	That's the profane thing to me is the idea of like
1928460	1931460	It's this old Hollywood thing of like
1931460	1933460	Yeah, what we do is so important
1933460	1935460	That it's worth human life
1935460	1936460	And it's not
1936460	1938460	Like, I mean that's
1938460	1940460	Well nothing's worth that
1940460	1942460	But if you have to be stuck on this motherfucker
1942460	1945460	You might as well make a show like that
1945460	1947460	Yeah, well, yeah
1947460	1949460	I mean he chose the job, right?
1949460	1951460	He probably could have quit
1951460	1953460	No
1954460	1956460	No, that's
1956460	1958460	That's why this is so complicated
1958460	1959460	No, but like
1959460	1960460	No, it's actually
1960460	1961460	Yeah
1961460	1962460	We didn't tell you
1962460	1963460	No, that's
1963460	1964460	There was this controversial program
1964460	1965460	We
1965460	1966460	Yeah

1978460	1980460	I like it
1980460	1981460	Better than the old one
1981460	1983460	I didn't grow up in New Jersey
1983460	1984460	Okay
1984460	1986460	I grew up on the Coney Island Pier

1992460	1996460	I was a carnival barker on the Coney Island Pier
1996460	1998460	Where were you born, Nick Rutherford?
1998460	2000460	I was born in Tarzana, California

2009460	2012460	I'm so confused, what?
2012460	2014460	I feel like everyone here is from somewhere else
2014460	2016460	And then there's a bunch of people that are just like
2016460	2020460	Hey, I was born here, like, I'm a con artist
2020460	2022460	Yeah
2022460	2025460	Well, maybe I'm just a funny con artist
2025460	2028460	I do feel like a con artist a lot of the time, you know
2028460	2030460	You're a lovely man
2030460	2031460	Thanks, Dan
2031460	2034460	I don't know you that well

2037460	2040460	Well, we've been hanging out, it's very fun to hang out with you
2040460	2041460	I trust you

2043460	2044460	The show
2044460	2045460	Yeah
2045460	2049460	We just felt like it was a bold choice to set a sitcom at an airport
2057460	2060460	Yeah, we got drizzle wings at BJ's
2060460	2063460	I can't believe there's a restaurant called BJ's
2063460	2066460	Yeah, what a fucked up set of initials
2066460	2068460	Yeah
2068460	2071460	He's thinking about his mom again
2071460	2075460	Does anybody call you BJ?
2075460	2077460	Fuck no
2079460	2082460	Yeah, I worked at Brandon's restaurant
2083460	2087460	But yeah, we had drizzle wings and is this good content?
2087460	2088460	Yeah, yeah, I mean
2088460	2092460	What kind of wings, let's talk about, are they those, the root beer wings that they got over there at BJ's?
2092460	2093460	What?
2093460	2095460	I think they have root beer wings at BJ's now
2095460	2096460	No, we didn't have those
2096460	2098460	Oh, well, what were they drizzled with?
2098460	2099460	Root beer?
2099460	2100460	Oh, yeah, they do have those
2100460	2101460	Well, you see
2101460	2103460	Well, that's just because you got me self-conscious now
2103460	2107460	Let's make sure, let's bring out a celebrity guest
2107460	2109460	Here's Rufy McFamous
2111460	2113460	Hey everybody
2114460	2115460	It's me
2115460	2116460	Rufy, what's up?
2116460	2117460	Hey
2119460	2122460	Rufy, I understand you have a book or movie coming out?
2122460	2123460	Yeah
2126460	2128460	What's that about?
2128460	2132460	Just living life on the East Coast, hanging out
2133460	2136460	Is that kind of self-autobiographical?
2136460	2137460	Yeah
2137460	2138460	Okay
2138460	2139460	Do you want me to go?
2139460	2140460	No
2140460	2141460	Wait, wait
2141460	2142460	Wait, are you?
2142460	2147460	I know I'm not a guest, so you just made up a guest with a guitar pedal
2149460	2150460	Don't
2150460	2151460	Rufy McCelebrity
2151460	2152460	You're ruining the
2153460	2155460	You don't tell people it's a guitar pedal
2155460	2157460	It doesn't even, it's not even a modulated voice
2157460	2160460	It's like two voices on top of each other
2160460	2162460	I can't even hear it, I don't even know
2162460	2165460	You just see Rufy that clearly
2167460	2168460	You guys, come on
2170460	2171460	I'm famous
2171460	2174460	I don't think that pedal is doing anything, honestly
2175460	2177460	Here's the thing
2177460	2178460	Here we are
2178460	2179460	Okay
2179460	2181460	It's me now, I'm more famous than ever
2182460	2185460	I remember working with Meryl Streep
2185460	2189460	Oh, on a car?
2189460	2190460	Oh, you guys built a car
2190460	2192460	I built a car with Meryl Streep
2194460	2197460	And four wheels
2197460	2198460	We're good
2198460	2199460	Fuck
2199460	2201460	This isn't easy
2201460	2203460	Being a guest on the show
2203460	2204460	No, you don't say
2204460	2207460	Anyways, yeah, I'm famous
2207460	2210460	And I built a car
2210460	2212460	And I wrote a book about it
2212460	2214460	You got into a lot of trouble recently
2214460	2217460	Yeah, I got kind of rumbled on Twitter
2217460	2218460	Uh-huh
2218460	2219460	Black Twitter
2219460	2220460	Right
2220460	2221460	The funny one
2221460	2222460	People don't tell you
2222460	2225460	That's a whole different Twitter
2225460	2228460	I love that that's what you think we call it
2230460	2233460	I knew you'd say that
2233460	2236460	That's what I got in trouble for
2236460	2238460	As I said
2238460	2239460	I bet it's not
2239460	2242460	Call Black Twitter by black people on Twitter
2242460	2246460	And then Black Twitter got all upset
2246460	2248460	And I was like, whatever
2248460	2250460	Snowflakes
2251460	2252460	Cocks
2254460	2255460	Cocks?
2255460	2257460	Did I trigger you?
2257460	2259460	Snowflake
2259460	2261460	Groofy, you're very right-wing
2261460	2264460	Well, no, that's not true
2264460	2267460	And I don't mean to be a contrarian
2268460	2271460	But I'm more of a centrist
2272460	2275460	I like things the way they were
2276460	2279460	When America was great
2281460	2283460	It just seems like a lot of like
2283460	2285460	What? A lot of what?
2285460	2286460	Jew
2286460	2287460	Yeah
2288460	2290460	Are you Jewish?
2291460	2292460	I don't even
2292460	2294460	Because a lot of Jewish people think I'm right-wing
2294460	2296460	But I'm not
2296460	2298460	That's just something Jews say
2299460	2300460	I find
2300460	2301460	Well, I'm not
2301460	2302460	I'm not Jewish
2302460	2303460	Okay, well, you talk like a Jew
2303460	2304460	Well, no, I don't
2304460	2305460	Okay, well, I'm not
2305460	2306460	What does a Jew talk like?
2306460	2307460	Well, I don't know
2307460	2309460	Because I'm centrist
2310460	2312460	I'm politically neutral
2312460	2313460	All right, you got me
2313460	2314460	I'm Jewish, fine
2314460	2316460	You fucking Jew
2317460	2318460	I love it
2318460	2319460	I love you
2319460	2321460	You're gonna get fucked on Jewish Twitter soon, man
2321460	2322460	Dude
2322460	2324460	Don't get me started
2324460	2325460	Player
2327460	2328460	Player
2330460	2331460	Rufy, everybody
2331460	2335460	Hey, this is Rufy's publicist
2335460	2336460	Oh, fuck
2337460	2338460	It's too late
2338460	2340460	And administrator
2340460	2342460	I am the administrator of black Twitter
2343460	2346460	And we're taking Rufy away now
2347460	2348460	What?
2348460	2349460	What'd you say?
2349460	2350460	He just had a
2350460	2351460	Ed 209
2351460	2352460	Oh, Ed 209
2352460	2354460	A classic character for the past
2354460	2355460	Yeah, Ed 209
2355460	2356460	This is Ed 209
2357460	2358460	You got excited
2358460	2359460	You were like
2359460	2360460	Yeah, I get it
2360460	2363460	I can't believe Ed 209 is Rufy McCelebrity's publicist
2363460	2364460	Hey, it's me, Ed 209
2366460	2370460	If anybody wants to yell out a character name at any point, please
2370460	2372460	You know what's exciting was Ed Newmeyer
2372460	2374460	Like, did we talk about it when he was on the show?
2374460	2375460	Like, his
2375460	2379460	One of his kids is like a non-binary activist
2379460	2382460	Like, trans and autistic
2382460	2387460	Like, you name it, they're an activist for it
2387460	2390460	And he wrote Robocop
2390460	2393460	And since he was on the show
2393460	2395460	Like, their kid who's like this crazy
2395460	2397460	Like, not crazy
2397460	2398460	That's a bad word
2398460	2400460	Crazy, I meant extreme
2400460	2404460	Like, super activist into trans rights and stuff
2404460	2408460	Like, they've heard my Ed 209 bit that I did years ago
2408460	2409460	Where I was Ed 209
2409460	2410460	And I was like
2410460	2413460	But it was like Ed 209 was gender fluid
2413460	2415460	And they heard it and they liked it
2420460	2423460	And they would have a lot of reason not to like it
2423460	2425460	I think I'm pretty fucking woke
2425460	2426460	This is an amazing
2426460	2427460	This is not part of the show
2427460	2429460	Like, I do fucking edgy shit that's like funny to everybody
2429460	2431460	And I never offend anyone
2432460	2434460	Okay, boomer
2434460	2436460	Oh, he did it
2436460	2444460	Ed 209 wasn't the robot that was addicted to nuke, right?
2444460	2446460	Yeah, that was T2
2446460	2450460	Yeah, that was the Frank Miller written sequel, Robocop 2
2450460	2452460	And you don't like it as much
2452460	2455460	Well, I mean, you can't like it if you're a Robocop fan
2455460	2457460	I mean, it's
2457460	2461460	In a vacuum is a pretty good movie, actually, I would think
2461460	2463460	Remember the little drug dealer kid?
2463460	2466460	Yeah, the kid, Ed Neumayer, talked about that
2466460	2467460	He cursed
2467460	2468460	I can't believe we had Ed Neumayer on the show
2468460	2470460	Well, now you have Nick Rutherford on the show
2470460	2471460	Yeah, all right, all right
2471460	2474460	So what is it, what's it, what was it like being in
2475460	2477460	A human giant
2480460	2481460	As great
2481460	2483460	Is a Z's as funny as
2483460	2484460	Even funnier in person
2484460	2485460	Okay
2488460	2490460	When you
2491460	2493460	Come up with your comedy
2493460	2494460	Uh-huh
2494460	2496460	What are you smoking?
2496460	2499460	Yeah, because some of these ideas, man, they're out there
2499460	2501460	What are you smoking when you come up with some of this stuff?
2501460	2506460	Yeah, just high on life and not Jesus, but the Jewish one
2509460	2510460	I guess not Jesus
2510460	2511460	Excuse me
2512460	2513460	Nick

2557460	2559460	Who says sucking me?
2561460	2563460	What in the bot?
2563460	2566460	What in the computer generated porn talk?

2726460	2727460	Just listen

2748460	2751460	Oh, I'm sorry, it's like Phil Collins
2751460	2755460	He never had a song named Phil Collins
2755460	2756460	No, I don't
2756460	2758460	I don't think he ever said his name in any of his songs
2758460	2759460	Yeah
2760460	2762460	Choose whatever reference you want
2762460	2764460	Okay, uh

2791460	2793460	Going long and strong
2794460	2796460	Six feet under

2800460	2801460	I am
2801460	2803460	Six feet under
2805460	2807460	That's cool
2807460	2809460	Oh, so Black Twitter came around
2809460	2811460	Yeah, I know, look
2812460	2816460	Everyone expects Black Twitter to not be into white people shit
2817460	2818460	I like this band
2819460	2821460	I love six feet under
2822460	2823460	Good
2823460	2825460	You want to go see them in concert?
2825460	2826460	Yes
2826460	2828460	Okay, here we go

2844460	2845460	Yup
2845460	2846460	That's cool
2848460	2849460	Oi
2850460	2852460	It's six feet under
2852460	2853460	They're Irish?
2854460	2856460	I think they're Australian?
2857460	2858460	Hey
2858460	2859460	Yeah
2860460	2861460	Jamaican
2861460	2863460	Hey
2863460	2865460	Everything's Irish
2867460	2868460	Jamaican
2868460	2869460	Jamaican
2869460	2871460	Alright, alright, that's not going anywhere
2872460	2876460	Okay, well anyways, so it's kind of a show
2876460	2878460	But not a show
2878460	2879460	Six feet under?
2879460	2880460	No, this
2882460	2884460	This is kind of, I mean this feels like a show
2884460	2886460	I think we did good so far
2886460	2888460	Yeah, yeah, I think we did good
2888460	2889460	How's Harmon Quest going?
2889460	2891460	Oh, it's done
2891460	2896460	We put it out already and it's in the hands of the people
2897460	2901460	You got any numbers on that? Did you retain the office's ratings?
2901460	2902460	We were, no
2902460	2905460	That was always the metric when I was your age
2905460	2906460	Yeah, that makes sense
2906460	2908460	How much of the office did you retain?
2908460	2909460	I don't think any of it
2909460	2911460	Okay, well you failed then
2911460	2912460	Yeah, by the way
2912460	2914460	We're moving you to 8pm, good luck
2914460	2916460	I mean that sounds great
2916460	2918460	Well, okay, CBS thinks so too, fuck off
2919460	2923460	Oh shit, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy
2924460	2927460	Steve Levy looking wonderful tonight
2927460	2929460	Doing a big hug
2929460	2930460	Jesus
2930460	2936460	That's how drunk I am that Levy brought out the booze like an hour into the show instead of 20 minutes
2937460	2940460	He was like, maybe this, maybe this will help, I don't know
2941460	2943460	There's more alcohol
2943460	2945460	We get to start booking real guests
2946460	2947460	Per se
2948460	2949460	Oh no, he's back
2949460	2950460	Thank you, Steve
2951460	2952460	No applause
2952460	2957460	Hey, Nick, when it comes to cities, Tarzana, not being from California
2957460	2960460	Tarzana, you have a rivalry with what city?
2961460	2962460	Well, I...
2962460	2964460	Jamesville
2964460	2966460	Yeah, civilization
2968460	2971460	Well, I didn't grow up in Tarzana, I grew up in Thousand Oaks
2971460	2972460	Okay, oh, okay
2972460	2975460	So, I was born in the valley, raised in Ventura County
2975460	2977460	Thousand Oaks is great, I grew up in Moore Park
2977460	2980460	And when you wanted to have fun, you would go to Thousand Oaks
2980460	2983460	Or if you wanted to not have very much fun, you go to CME Valley
2984460	2986460	Yeah, CME Valley is like more kind of funkier
2986460	2993460	The thing I know about CME Valley is they had an outlier in terms of per capita incest rates
2995460	2996460	And an outlier
2996460	2998460	And the show's back on track, ladies and gentlemen
2999460	3001460	Thank Christ, where'd you get here by bus?
3001460	3004460	Holy shit, entertainment finally arrived
3005460	3008460	Yeah, no, but all the cool people went to Thousand Oaks, that's where the mall was
3009460	3010460	Hold on, hold on
3010460	3011460	Yeah, hey guys
3011460	3014460	How did you find out about the incest thing, and then what are the numbers?
3014460	3016460	I looked at the census
3016460	3019460	No, I don't know, I ran the numbers
3019460	3021460	It's on there like, welcome to CME, son
3021460	3022460	It was it, yeah
3022460	3024460	It says population, but really
3024460	3028460	Population 20,000, 5,000 incest
3029460	3036460	When are we going to confront the fact, pornographically, that literally everyone is getting online and like
3037460	3038460	Stupid
3038460	3042460	Pornhub is this beautiful thing where they can report these numbers
3042460	3046460	They go, happy St. Patrick's Day, here's how many people searched for leprechaun rape
3048460	3050460	It's like, what's his name, Kinsey?
3050460	3053460	That's what we had back in the day, was that Kinsey guy
3054460	3058460	Who basically just represented to everyone who's like, hey, whatever you're thinking
3058460	3060460	Like, no one's normal
3060460	3063460	That was his contribution to mankind
3063460	3066460	And that's kind of what Pornhub represents
3067460	3073460	They're like, hey everybody, you're all searching for incest porn, all of you
3073460	3075460	Well, that's all there is now
3076460	3082460	I heard someone say that the attention towards incest porn signaled
3082460	3085460	A deep lack of connection felt by the user base
3085460	3088460	Everyone is feeling super isolated
3088460	3091460	And they don't have any sort of connections to draw upon
3091460	3094460	So, you know, when you kind of eroticize that
3094460	3096460	That's like the truest form of a bond
3096460	3098460	As someone who's already your family
3098460	3102460	But I find that, this is going to sound silly
3102460	3104460	But I find that incredibly unscientific
3104460	3106460	Oh, no, that's philosophical
3106460	3109460	I can very easily say, philosophically
3109460	3111460	No, it's the opposite
3112460	3114460	Are two connected with their families
3114460	3116460	It's two connected
3116460	3119460	Here's a sample size of one, but I hate everyone in my family
3119460	3122460	And I love incest porn, so, you know
3122460	3124460	I guess that's also not scientific
3125460	3127460	It's just taboo, right?
3127460	3129460	Well, that's part of it, sure
3129460	3131460	It's like you got to, I think it's like
3131460	3136460	But my biggest question is, does sex have to be taboo
3136460	3138460	That's my huge question
3138460	3140460	Like, could you let
3140460	3142460	And good money?
3143460	3146460	Could humankind, if they were given an infinite sandbox
3146460	3148460	If they were given total permission
3148460	3150460	And there was no such thing as taboo
3150460	3158460	Would sexuality, my speculation, my gut tells me
3158460	3163460	That sex is not automatically tied to
3163460	3164460	Shame
3164460	3165460	Naughtiness
3165460	3167460	And it's not even American
3167460	3170460	It's just human, homo sapien
3170460	3173460	We just have this thing
3173460	3176460	Oh, it's naughty, because we're so into it
3176460	3179460	And part of what we're into is the naughtiness
3179460	3181460	It's like putting your thumb over a garden hose
3181460	3184460	It makes it spray more
3184460	3185460	This is how you jerk off?
3185460	3187460	That's how I do it, yeah
3187460	3190460	The inhibition is what drives things
3190460	3193460	But I don't think that that thumb needs to be there
3193460	3197460	I think there's a version of humanity that just flows out of the hose
3197460	3201460	Well, I think taboo is attractive the same way
3201460	3203460	It's attractive to touch a hot stove
3203460	3206460	It's like, I know I can't do that, so I want to
3206460	3208460	But it's like, so that's part of what's important
3208460	3210460	But I think that's a human inclination
3210460	3213460	That then goes and ties in with their shame towards sex and stuff
3213460	3217460	But yeah, I think that we would still seek out various forms of taboo
3217460	3219460	If sex weren't taboo, but it wouldn't be
3219460	3222460	There's another function of taboo that I think
3222460	3226460	When I explore it myself, when I go like, why is it that I'm thinking about this fucked up shit
3226460	3229460	You know, when I have so much permission to do whatever I want
3229460	3234460	Like, why am I continually going to, like, bad places where I'm not supposed to be
3234460	3237460	Gonna grab that officer's gun
3239460	3241460	That's all I think about
3241460	3243460	Hot stoves and...
3243460	3245460	I don't know what I gotta do with it, but once I have it
3245460	3246460	Top killing
3246460	3247460	Then I'll know
3247460	3252460	And I think the answer is because as human beings, as animals
3252460	3254460	We want to just engage in sex
3254460	3256460	We want to have fun with sex
3256460	3259460	But we work with each other
3259460	3260460	We wear neckties
3260460	3263460	We go like, oh, can I take your order please
3263460	3265460	Like, we have alphabets
3265460	3267460	We don't just fuck to make up words
3267460	3270460	Like, we don't just shit in the street
3270460	3271460	We go in toilets
3271460	3275460	And so we, as human beings, as sentient mammals
3275460	3279460	We don't even trust ourselves to be fully sexual
3279460	3282460	Unless we build a wall around it
3282460	3285460	We need it to be private
3285460	3288460	Or we don't really actually trust that it's erotic
3288460	3289460	Or intimate
3289460	3292460	I mean, that's the other component of it is that because it's intimacy, it's gotta be hidden
3292460	3295460	So there is this automatic built-in naughty, right?
3295460	3297460	It's because you're eating chocolate, you know
3297460	3300460	Well, it's kinda like, how many friendships are based off of, like, this moment
3300460	3302460	Where you, like, take each other aside and you're like
3303460	3305460	Are you thinking what I'm thinking? It's, like, naughty
3305460	3307460	There's something, it's, like, shit talking to a third friend
3307460	3309460	Or some situation you're both in
3309460	3311460	It's, like, it's that
3311460	3315460	It is the fact that you're not supposed to be saying what you're saying
3315460	3319460	That actually makes what you're going through sincere
3319460	3320460	Yes
3320460	3323460	And there's something really funny about that
3323460	3327460	It equates to me with that feral pig thing
3327460	3331460	Where the reason feral pigs are a problem is because
3332460	3336460	There are people who are incentivized to hunt feral pigs
3336460	3338460	And so they're breeding the pigs
3338460	3341460	Like, if you really wanted feral pigs to go away
3341460	3345460	You should make it not legal to hunt them
3345460	3350460	Whereas, if you really wanted, like, taboo sexuality to go away
3350460	3355460	You should, like, accept that sexuality is what it is
3355460	3357460	And then it would, because people would then be like
3357460	3359460	Oh, okay, I'm allowed to be sexual
3359460	3363460	But it's, like, for my money, I'm, like, I find myself with Cody
3363460	3365460	Like, my mind will wander
3365460	3368460	I'm, like, why is my mind wandering when I'm with Cody?
3368460	3370460	Like, we're already filthy enough
3370460	3373460	Like, we do, we get up to enough, like, bad shit
3373460	3379460	And I'm, like, oh, it's because you want to trick your brain
3379460	3384460	Into only focusing on the primal sexuality
3384460	3385460	Like, you trust it then
3385460	3387460	You're, like, well, there's no way
3387460	3391460	This has anything to do with anything other than my dick, then
3391460	3393460	If this is what's going on
3393460	3395460	I nailed it
3397460	3398460	It's drywall
3398460	3399460	Taboo is drywall
3399460	3401460	It's just like this, like, it's
3401460	3403460	It's a taboo's drywall
3403460	3404460	Yeah
3404460	3405460	All right, all right
3405460	3406460	We proved it
3406460	3408460	Well, I mean, I think you kind of hit on it
3408460	3410460	That, like, you have a little secret
3410460	3411460	People bond over secrets, right?
3411460	3412460	Right
3412460	3414460	They bond over something that they can withhold from other people
3414460	3417460	And that is, in a way, connection
3417460	3420460	Also, can we get back to touching the hot stove?
3420460	3421460	I'll get there
3421460	3422460	Okay
3422460	3423460	What do you want to talk about it?
3423460	3424460	I don't have
3424460	3426460	I am so afraid of getting burnt
3426460	3428460	I got burnt making popcorn
3429460	3430460	Mm-hmm
3430460	3431460	Yeah
3431460	3432460	And that's the story
3432460	3435460	Well, do you have the thing where
3435460	3437460	When you're up high, you picture yourself jumping off
3437460	3438460	Yes, I do have that
3438460	3442460	I think the human mind has this mechanism
3442460	3445460	It's a survival mechanism where it's kind of like flashcards
3445460	3448460	It runs through scenarios and then has visceral reactions to that
3448460	3451460	And those cement the, like, connections on our brain
3451460	3453460	And so you think of jumping off a cliff
3453460	3455460	And then you're like, bad, that's scary, that's horrifying
3455460	3458460	And you're like, okay, if I'm in a situation where that actually comes up
3458460	3460460	I'll remember that feels terrible and I won't do it
3460460	3462460	The same with grabbing a cop's gun
3462460	3464460	Or, you know, like, um
3465460	3467460	You keep wedging that in there, man
3467460	3468460	That's the kind of thing
3468460	3471460	Whenever I see a cop, I'm like, man, I could just
3471460	3473460	Sucker punch it right in the neck
3474460	3476460	What do you do with it?
3476460	3478460	You're only going to seal your own death
3478460	3480460	Like, that's the only thing that could come of that
3480460	3482460	But it's something I think about all the time
3482460	3483460	Um, I can't stop
3483460	3485460	We know, we know
3485460	3488460	But, yeah, like, so I think there's a lot of shameful thoughts we have
3488460	3490460	And then we have guilt associated with it
3490460	3494460	But it's like, you having that thought and then that reaction
3494460	3499460	Is you affirming, like, your ethical nature or something, you know
3499460	3502460	And I think that's, I think people think those thoughts and they're like
3502460	3504460	Oh, this is so violent or something
3504460	3506460	This is, I'm so fucked up
3506460	3508460	But it's like, no, you're revulsed by that
3508460	3512460	And that's because, like, that's your brain reminding you to not be a sociopath
3512460	3517460	Because if you're like, oh, man, that actually seems like a fine thing to do with no consequences
3517460	3519460	That means your brain doesn't work right, you know
3519460	3523460	And I feel like the worst elements among us are constantly using, like, naturalism
3523460	3525460	We've talked about this before
3526460	3530460	They act like if they can conceive of the idea that it would be natural
3530460	3532460	Or people that have a natural inclination
3532460	3534460	It's like, aha, that's proof
3534460	3537460	Like, women do this and you know it, ladies
3537460	3538460	Don't fucking deny it
3538460	3539460	Ah, we proved it
3539460	3541460	It's like, yeah, but you, people take shits
3541460	3543460	But you do it in a toilet
3543460	3545460	Because if we did it in the street, we don't get sick
3545460	3548460	Yeah, natural, it's called, like, the naturalism fallacy
3548460	3552460	It's a classic logical fallacy that people use to try and excuse behavior
3552460	3553460	But it just doesn't hold up
3554460	3558460	Well, like you said, like, we built a toilet because shitting is natural
3558460	3562460	Yeah, and we all get to live to 80 instead of 50 because of it
3562460	3564460	Yeah, exactly, so natural isn't good
3564460	3567460	But their whole premise is natural is better than unnatural
3567460	3570460	It doesn't make any sense, like, alphabets aren't natural
3570460	3571460	No
3571460	3572460	We fucking made that shit up
3572460	3576460	Yeah, it's crazy, it's crazy to think that all the words are made up
3576460	3578460	A, B, C, it's crazy
3578460	3579460	Yeah
3579460	3582460	D, E, come on
3582460	3584460	Come on with E, yeah, fuck E
3584460	3586460	I do all that than F
3586460	3587460	I like F
3587460	3590460	I mean, okay, ooh, that's pretty cool
3590460	3592460	But G?
3592460	3594460	H?
3594460	3596460	This is like your big H fan over there
3596460	3598460	Big H
3599460	3600460	Guy loves H
3600460	3603460	I like, you know, bonobo monkeys
3603460	3605460	Yeah, the sex thing, you know what they love?
3605460	3606460	Incest
3606460	3607460	Yeah
3607460	3609460	And fucking gang orgies
3609460	3611460	Yeah, it's like conflict resolution
3611460	3613460	They love wiki fencing
3613460	3615460	They are genetically our
3615460	3616460	Look it up
3616460	3619460	The closest animal to us that's also another species
3619460	3620460	Uh-huh
3620460	3621460	We are bonobos
3621460	3622460	I'm very fascinated by it
3622460	3627460	But we, they don't have religion or like, you know, Protestantism telling you like
3627460	3632460	Don't, this is the limit, that was the biggest word I know
3632460	3635460	Don't, you know, don't, you gross
3635460	3637460	Oh, you grabbed a booby, that's gross
3637460	3638460	Don't touch a
3638460	3639460	Yeah
3639460	3641460	When they get into a fucking tussle over a banana
3641460	3642460	They suck each other off
3642460	3643460	Yeah
3643460	3644460	Yeah
3644460	3645460	They have orgies
3645460	3646460	That's their breakdown
3646460	3648460	One of the bonobos is like, oh, you're sucking me right now
3648460	3649460	Yeah
3649460	3652460	They're like, they're like, two bonobo tribes are like
3652460	3654460	There's only so much fresh water here
3654460	3656460	Ooh, ah, ah, ah
3656460	3657460	I got an idea
3657460	3660460	And then someone's like, all right, it's go time
3660460	3662460	Ooh, ah, ooh
3662460	3665460	And then they just all fucking suck and lick
3665460	3668460	And then they, yeah, they wake up and they're like, we can share the water
3668460	3670460	Yeah, what the fuck, man?
3670460	3671460	God damn
3671460	3672460	Like, let's all agree
3672460	3674460	The only reason we wanted water is so we could hydrate
3674460	3675460	So we could do this
3675460	3676460	More fucking
3676460	3677460	And goddamn, you're a great sucker
3677460	3678460	That's my sister
3678460	3679460	There's my cousin
3679460	3680460	There's my Uncle Glenn
3680460	3682460	Like, we're doing it fucking upside down
3682460	3685460	Scientists were studying bonobos
3685460	3688460	Like, there's a, there's a huge like lag
3688460	3690460	Behind the scientific study of them
3690460	3692460	Because in the 50s
3692460	3696460	People were just like, they kept like, noting their behavior
3696460	3698460	And then like, not writing it down
3698460	3700460	Literally, they were just like, well, that's fucked up
3700460	3702460	I can't write that down
3702460	3703460	That's crazy
3703460	3706460	I can't tell my wife what I watched today
3706460	3707460	And that is the generation
3707460	3709460	I'm a primatologist, not a pornographer
3709460	3710460	Yeah
3710460	3712460	And they would just go, well, that's an outlier
3712460	3714460	Turns out we are the outliers
3714460	3715460	That is what we are
3715460	3717460	We want to fuck and suck, baby
3717460	3718460	That's it
3718460	3719460	That's all we have to do to live is eat and fuck
3719460	3720460	That's it
3720460	3723460	But Desmond Morris
3723460	3726460	Says, well, then we had to compete with wolves
3726460	3729460	So like, the other part of us is like, we have this pack mentality
3729460	3731460	This alpha mentality
3731460	3734460	Like, we're ashamed of our fucky sucky part
3734460	3737460	Like, we hate, we hate how communist we are
3737460	3739460	We hate that we just want to groom each other
3739460	3741460	And like, lick each other's tits
3741460	3748460	We don't like it because it suggests to us that we're gonna die
3749460	3753460	Which is not an unfounded belief, genetically
3753460	3756460	Because our primate cousins are like, dying
3756460	3758460	And we are
3758460	3760460	But they're dying because they didn't invent drywall
3760460	3765460	Well, I mean, they're dying like, not really because of us
3765460	3768460	They're just dying because it's hard to have a planet that's so lush
3768460	3772460	That its equator can support this fucking giant, tailless ape
3772460	3775460	That doesn't climb trees anymore because it's too heavy
3775460	3778460	And just hangs out and wipes its ass with its hand
3778460	3780460	And fucking howls at the moon
3780460	3783460	It's like a flash on the pan
3783460	3789460	But the version of those primates that experimented with this weird forebrain
3789460	3792460	That's us, and here we are, going strong
3792460	3795460	We're ashamed of our animal nature
3795460	3799460	We hate the part of us that is like, would save our lives right now
3799460	3803460	We hate, we hate that we just want to chill
3803460	3807460	And if we just held ourselves to the standard that we had when we were chimpanzees
3807460	3809460	We could fucking save the world
3809460	3812460	But we have this compulsion, we're just like, yeah, but what about my iPhone?
3812460	3815460	What about the fucking smokestacks? What about the rocket ships?
3815460	3817460	What about fighting this other person?
3817460	3821460	You told me, Brandon, at one point
3821460	3825460	We still genetically, we're acting like we're
3825460	3828460	We have this feeling like we're competing over resources
3828460	3830460	Yeah, scarcity
3830460	3834460	I mean, at the end of the day, we go through all this technology
3834460	3836460	And we get to these great heights
3836460	3840460	But there's always like two floors of breast augmentation
3840460	3842460	And like one floor for sick kids with cancer
3842460	3844460	Because we're monkeys
3844460	3846460	And we're just like, titty, oh, titty, make titty roll
3846460	3848460	Gotta make titty floor
3848460	3850460	Titty floor, like, well, your kid's sick
3850460	3853460	I know my kid's sick, titty, titty, titty
3853460	3857460	Got a titty, shiny monkey, banana, more banana
3857460	3860460	And you can tell monkeys, this is gonna be awful for you
3860460	3863460	This piece of technology is gonna be awful for you
3863460	3865460	Whether it's breast augmentation or a cell phone screen
3865460	3868460	And they're like, yeah, but titty
3868460	3871460	Yeah, but can you imagine a monkey with tits?
3871460	3873460	That would be fucking hell, yeah
3873460	3875460	If you could just talk to a chimpanzee
3875460	3877460	If chimpanzees could talk, that would be
3877460	3880460	If you could teach one to talk, not sign language, none of that bullshit
3880460	3883460	Oh, okay, not sign language bullshit
3883460	3886460	All right, sorry, deaf people that listen to the podcast
3887460	3889460	We're gonna lift that
3889460	3891460	They're gonna hear you laugh, and it's gonna be fucked up
3891460	3893460	Yeah, you guys, fuck you
3893460	3896460	Yeah, that's on you guys, that was a test
3896460	3901460	Whoever's signing you guys to them, it's on you guys
3901460	3906460	If a chimpanzee could actually have a sentient conversation with us
3906460	3908460	That would be, that's what we need
3908460	3910460	The atonement with the fuck
3910460	3913460	We have that, it's called the president dent
3913460	3915460	Oh, yeah
3916460	3920460	No, no, that's a fucking wolf, that guy's a fucking jag off
3920460	3925460	A chimpanzee would go, okay, what's all this ruckus?
3925460	3928460	What are you guys doing? What's happening?
3928460	3931460	And we'd be like, we're trying to save the earth
3931460	3932460	We gotta ask
3932460	3936460	From what? Spotted leopards, giraffes, ants?
3936460	3939460	Like, what is it, a chimpanzee would be like, what the fuck is your problem?
3939460	3941460	Calm down
3941460	3944460	And we'd be like, no, no, no, it's these people in Saudi Arabia
3945460	3947460	I don't know what you're talking about
3947460	3950460	What are you so fucking panicked about?
3950460	3951460	But they're tribal
3951460	3953460	Yeah, they literally war
3953460	3955460	Yeah, chimpanzees are gnarly
3955460	3957460	They're just as worried as we are, just about
3957460	3960460	All right, well, you guys are taking it a little more literally
3960460	3963460	Oh, the monkey mad, because we told him he was a monkey
3963460	3967460	Yeah, I know if we could talk to an actual monkey that they'd be inferior to us culturally
3967460	3970460	You know what you should do is rip that guy's head open and he's his brain
3971460	3975460	I just mean, I'm saying like
3975460	3979460	Like us, minus the thing that separates us from chimps
3979460	3983460	Which is like this fucking compulsion to reach for the stars
3983460	3986460	We are no, our stars are shit
3986460	3990460	If we could just, if we were just to take one breath and go
3990460	3997460	What if we, just as a litmus test, what if we just for one second held ourselves to the standard of the chimpanzee
3997460	3999460	And fuck frogs
4000460	4004460	And like, which would define a frog as a great Saturday afternoon
4004460	4009460	And which would define indoors as a fucking miracle
4009460	4011460	Because we control the weather
4011460	4017460	Like a chimpanzee that could make a house would be a chimpanzee that wouldn't make war
4017460	4020460	A chimpanzee, they would be like, fuck, are you fucking kidding me?
4020460	4021460	But they do
4021460	4024460	They make, they make like, leave houses and leave beds
4024460	4025460	And they, they
4025460	4027460	I feel like, I don't want to bump you in
4027460	4029460	I think what you're saying is, I don't know
4029460	4031460	I keep coming back to more and more in my life
4031460	4033460	That like humans are driven to strive
4033460	4034460	We like being in conflicts
4034460	4037460	We like, we have a goal and we go for this goal
4037460	4039460	But then you hit that goal and you're like, well this fucking sucks
4039460	4041460	I hate this, I hate myself, nothing has changed
4041460	4042460	I still want to die
4042460	4043460	We're afflicted as a species
4043460	4047460	Yeah, but I think that, so like if you could like go to therapy and work that out
4047460	4048460	But it's like every human has that
4048460	4050460	And I think that's evolutionary because it's like
4050460	4052460	Oh man, I just got to jump over this cliff
4052460	4053460	So I get away from the wolf
4053460	4056460	And like a couple people survived and passed down that trait
4056460	4060460	And it's like, I'm really good under serious pressure
4060460	4063460	And I only feel like alive under pressure
4063460	4067460	And once I accomplish the thing that I'm evolutionarily allowed to accomplish
4067460	4068460	I don't feel better
4068460	4071460	Because evolution wants me to keep going, keep doing those same things
4071460	4072460	And keep propagating the species
4072460	4074460	But that just makes us all miserable
4074460	4078460	Like if you put a spider in an aquarium full of flies
4078460	4081460	Like, and it was like, I got to build a web, I got to build a web
4081460	4084460	And you'd be like, dude, you don't have to build a web
4084460	4085460	And the spider would be like, what are you talking about?
4085460	4086460	How am I going to catch all these flies?
4086460	4088460	No, the flies are right there
4088460	4092460	Like if the spider could just understand and cheat the system
4092460	4094460	And go, oh, the flies are there
4094460	4098460	I'll save all of this biological energy that God gave me
4098460	4105460	Like, my metabolism is so high because it expects my ass to like crank out silk
4105460	4109460	Um, what if the spider was aware enough to go
4109460	4110460	Yeah, but I don't have to do that
4110460	4112460	There's a bucket of flies here
4112460	4115460	That's the situation that we could be in
4115460	4118460	You assume that the web is built to catch the flies
4118460	4122460	Not that he is a compulsion to build the web without knowing its relation to the flies
4122460	4123460	Whoa
4123460	4124460	What?
4124460	4125460	Yeah, that is it
4125460	4126460	Whoa
4126460	4128460	Because that is the human experience
4128460	4129460	Yeah, we just got to do it
4129460	4131460	That's what, yeah, I agree with you there
4131460	4132460	That's the thing
4132460	4139460	Skyscrapers, space programs, alphabets, eyeglasses, insulin, podcasts
4140460	4145460	Uh, uh, Oprah, uh, Tom Hanks, toothpicks, uh, wallpaper
4145460	4147460	Oh, see, Billy Joel Williams got the fire
4147460	4148460	I like this
4150460	4153460	All of it is like a web we're spinning
4153460	4157460	Like humans, and we have ourselves convinced that we're like making these decisions
4157460	4160460	We're not at all, obviously it's compulsive behavior
4160460	4163460	Or we wouldn't fucking do the shit that we do
4163460	4166460	It's obviously compulsive, obviously
4167460	4169460	But we measure intelligence by this thing
4169460	4171460	Where we go, well, if you know what you're doing
4171460	4173460	And then you choose to do it, that means it's your choice
4173460	4175460	That's horseshit
4175460	4177460	We're not choosing shit, Jack
4177460	4178460	Right, it's true
4178460	4182460	Nick, your book's coming out, right?
4182460	4183460	Yeah, yeah
4184460	4186460	You were going to write a chapter?
4186460	4188460	Yeah, I lived with the Bonobos for a year
4188460	4193460	And we would just suck and fuck each other all the time
4193460	4196460	I don't know, yeah, I drank since 10 a.m.
4196460	4197460	How much do you think you drank?
4197460	4199460	We know how long you drank, but how much do you think you drank?
4199460	4202460	I feel like 75,000 units of alcohol
4202460	4203460	That might be right
4203460	4206460	How are you still able to do all this?
4206460	4208460	It's called functional alcoholism
4208460	4210460	And it's like the most dangerous kind
4210460	4212460	Did you see Denzel Washington in flight?
4212460	4214460	Yeah, he saved all those people
4214460	4216460	Yeah, those people were so pissed
4216460	4218460	He's a goddamn hero
4218460	4220460	That's why that movie is so important
4220460	4222460	Because Denzel has nobody...
4222460	4224460	He's the only one holding himself accountable at the end
4224460	4226460	He could fly a plane upside down
4226460	4229460	And he could get away with drinking while flying
4229460	4232460	And then finally at the end, he alone has to be like
4232460	4234460	Nah, dude, fuck you, I'm drunk
4235460	4238460	I really was bummed by that ending
4238460	4240460	I don't know what that says about me
4240460	4243460	I'll never watch that movie again, but I will forever say
4243460	4245460	That was such a...
4245460	4248460	In the world of cinematic portrayals of alcoholism
4248460	4251460	That is like the fucking end-all be-all
4251460	4253460	That and McNulty and The Wire
4253460	4257460	Like that, like when he would get drunk, McNulty
4257460	4258460	McNulty?
4258460	4259460	Fuck you guys
4259460	4260460	On The Wire?
4260460	4262460	The Wire, come on, Jesus Christ
4262460	4263460	I've never seen The Wire
4263460	4264460	Oh, for fuck's sake
4264460	4265460	David Simon?
4265460	4267460	Oh my God, they just turned on me so hard
4267460	4269460	The whole audience is over it
4269460	4272460	I'm sorry, there wasn't a dragon in it
4272460	4274460	Fucking nerd
4274460	4275460	I've never...
4275460	4277460	I didn't watch Game of Thrones either
4277460	4279460	I watch Wings
4279460	4280460	Yeah
4280460	4281460	hilarious
4281460	4282460	God damn it
4282460	4284460	Don't remember where my wing heads at
4284460	4286460	Don't let our director really want wings
4286460	4288460	Let's meet one friend
4288460	4294460	Who really genuinely feels like they deserve attention
4295460	4296460	Uh-oh
4296460	4297460	I'm proud of you guys
4297460	4298460	That was an amazing response
4298460	4300460	This dude has a sign
4300460	4303460	It says, give me 90 seconds to speak
4304460	4305460	Um
4308460	4309460	Oh no
4309460	4312460	Well, if they made a sign, let's find out what it's about
4312460	4314460	Come on, come on sign, guys
4314460	4316460	He got to come up, he got to come up
4316460	4317460	Come on, sign
4317460	4318460	It's a style audience
4318460	4319460	He made a sign
4319460	4320460	Who came from the farthest?
4320460	4322460	Because there's a lot of people in town
4322460	4324460	For the last couple
4324460	4326460	Florida, who's farther than Florida?
4327460	4329460	We have anybody from Italy, Germany
4330460	4332460	Man, Germany, y'all always fuck up when y'all get up here
4332460	4334460	But we might fuck with you later
4334460	4335460	What's your name, friend?
4335460	4337460	This guy's like the perfect version of me
4338460	4339460	Hilarious
4339460	4340460	This is so fucked up
4340460	4342460	He's like airbrushed you
4342460	4345460	I like look tired and sick next to him
4346460	4347460	His fucking shirt's open
4347460	4350460	He took a Photoshop tool and just went vroop
4350460	4351460	25
4352460	4353460	Vroop
4353460	4354460	Good guess, yeah
4354460	4355460	God damn it
4355460	4357460	He probably sings
4357460	4358460	That's another good guess, yeah
4358460	4359460	What's your name, friend?
4359460	4360460	My name is Pele
4361460	4363460	He's named after an amazing soccer player
4364460	4365460	Oh, Pele
4365460	4367460	Yeah, my dad was a big soccer fan
4367460	4370460	To the audience, I waited for like a moment where he asked
4370460	4372460	I didn't just raise it, you know what I mean?
4372460	4374460	No, you gotta forgive us
4374460	4375460	Wait, this is the signed guy?
4375460	4376460	You'll win them over, no worries
4376460	4377460	This is the signed guy
4377460	4379460	I feel pretty good, man
4379460	4383460	Our audience, I very much respect our audience
4383460	4385460	It's like skepticism about people that come up
4385460	4386460	What's been
4386460	4388460	Yeah, you're right to, that's good
4388460	4389460	You're going like, hey, look
4389460	4391460	I'm not like some crazy person
4391460	4393460	that just really thinks they're entitled to it
4393460	4394460	That's what the audience worries about
4394460	4397460	Like, oh, don't, don't, I could have been up there
4397460	4398460	and I didn't go up there
4398460	4401460	Well, you just can't go up there because you want to be up there
4401460	4404460	You're humble and you've done it, you nailed it
4404460	4405460	Now you can do whatever you want
4405460	4406460	Be racist
4407460	4410460	A mixed race, that would be a strange choice for me
4410460	4411460	But it would be okay
4411460	4412460	So racist to say that
4414460	4415460	I don't see a mixed race
4415460	4417460	What did your sign say?
4417460	4419460	The idea that mixed race people can't be racist
4420460	4423460	I find really offensive as a white person
4423460	4425460	What did your sign say?
4425460	4426460	It was kind of over promising
4426460	4429460	because I thought that I could weave together
4429460	4430460	some disparate ideas
4430460	4432460	The sign said, give me 90 seconds
4432460	4436460	and I can offer a fulfilling conclusion
4436460	4438460	You had 60 seconds right now, bro
4438460	4439460	Sorry, 90, 90 seconds
4439460	4440460	Oh, geez
4440460	4441460	You had 60 seconds right now, bro
4441460	4442460	I have 60, okay, all right
4442460	4443460	I got people from Germany wanting to get up here, bro
4443460	4444460	You better hurry up
4444460	4445460	I'm from Canada, if that makes a difference
4445460	4446460	I'm still staying pretty
4446460	4447460	I got lost in my eyes
4447460	4448460	You're so handsome
4449460	4450460	Don't let him thwart you
4451460	4452460	You got 30 more seconds
4455460	4457460	Firstly, I want to thank you for doing what you do
4457460	4459460	Not just for this and for Harmony request
4459460	4465460	It's not always easy, but I do it for the people
4465460	4467460	I appreciate that
4467460	4470460	And also for opening up your platform over the years
4470460	4471460	I've been listening to you for a while
4471460	4473460	to people who wouldn't otherwise be heard
4473460	4476460	Regular people like myself and socialists and minorities
4477460	4480460	And you're using your soft power, your platform
4480460	4482460	to allow people to talk
4482460	4483460	You're welcome
4484460	4487460	But shouldn't he use his hard power?
4487460	4488460	Doesn't it feel like...
4488460	4490460	Did he say soft power? Is that a phrase?
4490460	4491460	Yeah, I'm a political theorist
4491460	4493460	That's why I wanted to talk, yeah
4493460	4495460	What does soft power mean?
4495460	4497460	So soft power is everything that's not hard power
4497460	4498460	It's...
4499460	4501460	Get the fuck off the stage
4501460	4502460	That's...
4504460	4508460	Academia, I gotta survive for six years
4508460	4511460	No, so hard power is like guns and money
4511460	4515460	It's military might and the straight up actual capital P power
4515460	4517460	Whereas soft power is diplomacy
4517460	4519460	And yeah, hegemonic forces, cultural forces, yeah
4519460	4521460	Like if your country has all the movies
4521460	4525460	Right, or if you are a person who runs shows that are in the side guys
4525460	4526460	Then you have some soft power to you
4526460	4528460	What did you want to say? Or if you happen to be...
4528460	4530460	No, I sidetracked him, I sidetracked him
4531460	4533460	Gotta be better than that to get up here
4533460	4534460	What did you want to say?
4534460	4535460	Right, sure
4535460	4537460	So I am a little flustered you might imagine right now
4537460	4538460	But essentially what I...
4538460	4539460	Unacceptable
4539460	4540460	Sitting next to me
4540460	4541460	It's gotta be hard
4541460	4542460	I run a tight ship
4544460	4546460	Don't take photos of this guy
4547460	4548460	Take photos of Nick
4548460	4549460	Not with me, next to him
4549460	4551460	It's like a before and after
4551460	4553460	This is like Faces of Meth right here
4553460	4555460	Pele, get in there man, get in there Pele
4555460	4557460	It's like you...
4557460	4558460	Okay, we know
4558460	4567460	So you've...over the years I've watched as you've gone from being a centrist
4569460	4570460	Hey man, give me security
4570460	4571460	Sorry, don't...
4571460	4572460	Give me security
4572460	4580460	Anarchist leaning a political person into sort of recognizing your role as you quoted
4580460	4582460	The world shifted under your feet
4583460	4588460	And I just think that you've gone out a lot of rants
4588460	4592460	I've seen you existentially worry about the state of politics and power
4592460	4597460	But you've never like delved into actually political theory
4597460	4601460	So I just wanted to get one idea out to your brain
4601460	4602460	That's what I wanted to do
4602460	4603460	Oh go for it
4603460	4604460	Nazism
4605460	4606460	Give it a shot
4606460	4608460	Mixed race Nazism
4609460	4610460	Hear me out
4610460	4612460	It actually is practical
4612460	4616460	It is the race that will dominate eventually
4616460	4619460	It makes sense, it's what God wants
4619460	4621460	Mixed race Nazism
4622460	4623460	It works
4624460	4627460	Let's get back in there Pele, let's get back in there
4627460	4628460	Okay, I'm back
4628460	4630460	See Rutherford had you on the ropes
4630460	4632460	Merge you up in penalty time Pele, come on
4632460	4637460	Essentially, it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong but it seems like
4637460	4641460	You are recognizing the issues of late stage capitalism
4641460	4645460	Oh they drew, you know, they booed Drake off stage last night
4646460	4649460	I'm gonna let you know what LA will do to you
4649460	4652460	Unless you get into that second song we all want to hear
4652460	4654460	Now let's go
4654460	4655460	Okay, and it seems like
4655460	4657460	Don't flustered that stuff, I feel bad for it
4657460	4660460	No, like say whatever you want
4660460	4662460	This is a really long 90 seconds, I'm sorry
4662460	4663460	Do it
4663460	4669460	And it seems like that to some degree you circle around the idea of anarchism as the alternative
4669460	4677460	And what that is doing is taking a corrupt and outdated mode of power or power structure
4677460	4681460	And then replacing it with a lack of power instead of fixing the power structure or evolving it
4681460	4683460	Yeah, I agree with you totally
4683460	4685460	No, I'm saying that that doesn't work because of the nature
4685460	4688460	Oh, wait, I disagree with you
4688460	4691460	No, wait, yeah, okay, sorry, continue
4691460	4697460	Yeah, so what I'm trying to say is that anarchy is impossible because of the maximum of power
4697460	4704460	The essential nature of what power is is that it looks to concretize itself, to cement itself, to understand itself
4704460	4706460	And it doesn't go away like that
4706460	4709460	So you need to fix the power structure, not dissolve the power structure
4709460	4711460	It sounds nice in theory because it's like
4711460	4714460	Oh, hey, everybody is on equal footing and everybody has equal power
4714460	4719460	But it's just what you're doing by the dissolution of political power is not empowering people
4719460	4725460	You empower people by having a political power that is powerful enough to give power to the people
4725460	4727460	Yeah, we don't tend to roll as anarchists
4727460	4729460	We don't tend to roll
4729460	4732460	We don't tend to roll non-hierarchically
4732460	4735460	We tend to, no matter what, you give us an infinite sandbox
4735460	4737460	You give us like a bunch of mushrooms
4737460	4742460	And like the hierarchies tend to happen because we're primates
4742460	4747460	Like we tend to fucking start leveraging each other and exchanging things
4747460	4749460	People tend to rise up and you go like
4749460	4752460	Hey, is it me or is that guy more awesome than that guy?
4752460	4754460	You kind of start to compare things
4754460	4756460	Why would you say that?
4758460	4761460	Why was that the example you gave?
4761460	4765460	I mean, I think I, yeah, I used to like
4765460	4768460	I was way left of Noam Chomsky when we started this podcast
4768460	4770460	Because I was like, I had that privilege
4770460	4773460	Like I never cared, I thought all politics was horseshit
4773460	4776460	Because it was dangling chads and are you going to convince me
4776460	4780460	Al Gore is any different from fucking George Bush and all my fucking bullshit
4780460	4784460	And then we went through, we sure showed me
4785460	4787460	We really showed me a thing or two
4787460	4791460	Like politics is not bullshit, it actually is a thing
4791460	4796460	Because both parties, admirably or not, like they both got hacked at the same time
4796460	4800460	Like the Democrats got hacked by quote unquote socialists
4800460	4802460	You know, just to oversimplify
4802460	4806460	And the Republicans got hacked by to oversimplify Nazis
4806460	4808460	Because they were both smart enough to go
4808460	4810460	We're not going to suffer the third party fate
4810460	4813460	And what happened, it was just like this crazy
4813460	4815460	So then politics became real politics
4815460	4819460	And then once it did, I was like, oh shit, I guess I can't be an anarchist anymore
4819460	4820460	I really can't
4820460	4824460	Because you actually have a bipartisan system that actually means something now
4824460	4826460	Because right actually means Nazi
4826460	4829460	And left actually means socialist and I don't want either of them
4829460	4833460	Because I want my Obama back
4833460	4837460	The other things that I was saying was total straight theory
4837460	4839460	This is just opinion to some degree
4839460	4841460	I mean it's based on, you can look at the empirical studies
4841460	4843460	And you can look at the theory of it
4843460	4846460	And essentially you can call it reform liberalism or democratic socialism
4846460	4848460	Democratic socialism or social democracy
4848460	4851460	They're all just different steps of the same thing
4851460	4856460	Which is a synthesis of market society and a powerful enough Leviathan to provide for people
4856460	4859460	But that seems to, that's the thing that is required
4859460	4860460	You're so handsome
4860460	4861460	Thank you so much
4861460	4863460	I can't focus on anything you're saying
4863460	4865460	I just want you to read my paper
4865460	4867460	Here you go, just take my life
4873460	4874460	Here he goes
4875460	4877460	Hey Vic, Vic, Vic, Vic
4878460	4879460	Leave the scooter
4886460	4890460	Yeah, I honestly, I'm too drunk to have followed what you just said
4890460	4893460	And that's on me, not you
4893460	4896460	I mean, I don't know man
4896460	4898460	We've been doing this podcast for eight years
4898460	4901460	I've tried to be up front about my politics
4901460	4905460	Which is like, man, I was sucking my thumb and going like
4905460	4908460	No baby, no baby, voting's bullshit and democracy's now
4908460	4910460	And you have been, you're amazing
4910460	4912460	I so appreciate how important you are about it
4912460	4914460	And then I told people when I changed my mind
4914460	4915460	I told people I was really wrong
4915460	4920460	And I got real invested to the extent that I'm like
4920460	4926460	No man, it's not even politics to me when it's like fascism versus anything other than that
4926460	4929460	And most recently, because it's primary season and stuff
4929460	4931460	I'm like, I'm not even going to talk about it
4931460	4932460	Because I don't want to be like
4932460	4934460	I'm an Elizabeth Warren guy and have everybody
4934460	4938460	Because I totally respect everybody
4938460	4940460	Like I don't want them fighting
4940460	4943460	Like it is a fucking heartbreak that the good guys
4943460	4945460	And yeah, they're the good guys
4945460	4947460	That they're all fighting
4947460	4948460	They have to fight now
4948460	4950460	And so I can't even
4950460	4952460	It's like, I just watch the whole thing play out
4952460	4953460	And I'm like, God damn it
4953460	4958460	I wish there was some way that we could be as unified as the shit faces
4958460	4959460	You can't, as far as I can tell
4959460	4962460	I mean, as somebody who's involved in politics, progressive politics
4962460	4964460	That's where the thinkers are
4964460	4966460	And that means that you get really neurotic people
4966460	4972460	Who are all worried about very specific and small issues or wording
4972460	4975460	When you think about like
4975460	4977460	Like I had talked on this podcast about
4977460	4980460	Because I heard some Radio Lab episode or whatever
4980460	4982460	About the Irish system
4982460	4983460	Like the way they do
4983460	4985460	Alternative rank chose floating, right?
4985460	4987460	Yeah, and it's like everyone gets five votes
4987460	4989460	And then they do some system where it's like
4989460	4990460	Oh yeah, yeah
4990460	4993460	First pass the post is terrible and antiquated
4993460	4994460	It doesn't work at all
4994460	4995460	Yeah
4995460	4996460	It makes sense
4996460	4997460	It's true
4997460	4998460	Look it up
4998460	5000460	When you actually think about that
5000460	5002460	What that is, the five votes is the first pass
5002460	5003460	No, no, that's our system
5003460	5005460	Here and in Canada, which is where I'm from
5005460	5006460	Is first pass the post
5006460	5007460	And he's Canadian
5007460	5008460	Oh, boy
5008460	5009460	You're tri-racial

5202460	5203460	Okay, okay
5203460	5206460	Um so I was at the community reunion yesterday
5206460	5207460	Oh shit
5207460	5208460	It was so fucking emotional
5208460	5211460	I like I cried when you guys got on stage like
5211460	5212460	Did you?
5212460	5213460	Yes
5213460	5216460	Did you happen to know I fucking like I
5216460	5220460	When I went up I thought I was like this is a problem
5220460	5221460	I had to shut it down
5221460	5223460	I was going to weep
5223460	5224460	Mm-hmm
5224460	5227460	That something about going up there
5227460	5230460	And everybody like in a line like you guys got up on stage
5230460	5231460	And I was just like fuck
5231460	5233460	I was like I had to make a decision in my head
5233460	5239460	I was like you were either going to weep in front of a bunch of people about your own sitcom
5239460	5244460	Which is as your generation calls it a bad look
5244460	5247460	Or you're going to fucking
5247460	5250460	Robot and like I made the right decision
5250460	5251460	You did really well
5251460	5252460	Yeah, thank you
5252460	5253460	Yeah, no you did well
5253460	5255460	Anyway, so what yeah it was emotional
5255460	5256460	It was truly emotional
5256460	5259460	It was emotional and so since I've been here so okay
5259460	5262460	So I got here on the 9th of August and on the 12th of August
5262460	5269460	There was my first Harmontown show and I've been coming every week and it's been like the best transitional thing for me
5269460	5275460	Because I mean, I don't know like this is the first time I've ever been here and I I'm really bad at making friends
5275460	5279460	But like Harmontown is the only like escape I have every week
5279460	5282460	And it's just it's amazing because I've been listening to the podcast
5282460	5288460	Like I remember being at home back in Pakistan and just like listening to the podcast and like laughing to myself
5288460	5292460	And just the fact that I can be here live is just it's insane
5292460	5296460	And it's kind of a mind-blower to me like I have no image in my head of Pakistan
5296460	5300460	Like we obviously that's where that's where Kumail is from
5300460	5305460	And like I don't talk about bad at making friends
5305460	5308460	Like I never asked him. What's it like there?
5308460	5313460	I have no image in my head, you know, like I don't know like where what was it?
5313460	5315460	What was it you you're just a little baby
5315460	5319460	Have you started listening to this show back when we started listening in 2013?
5319460	5324460	I was just starting my undergrad. So yeah, I wasn't a baby. I was pretty old
5324460	5330460	What is it you living with your parents in Pakistan? It's like a house an apartment. It's a so
5330460	5336460	We have a really large farmhouse. So it's just it's pretty cool. But it's very like rural
5336460	5343460	Like there's lots of donkeys. Did you have like dogs? Yeah, I have one dog. And was it long or short hair?
5344460	5346460	Brandon
5346460	5350460	What the heck? No, I just wonder was it long or short hair? Brandon is doing his cold reading technique
5350460	5354460	He's about to tell you the ghost of your father wants you to
5354460	5357460	He buried your money in Arkansas
5357460	5361460	My dog is a German Shepherd. So you had to cut his hair. No
5361460	5362460	Oh
5362460	5365460	What is going on? What is happening?
5365460	5368460	What is what is that?
5369460	5374460	I'm just trying to figure out if she had a dog and they had to cut the hair. That's all
5376460	5382460	What you say that like that's an innocent thing to want, you know, that's tell you the secrets of controlling
5382460	5387460	But I get people to talk. Do you want to know about Victor's dogs hair length? Sure
5387460	5392460	Do you have a dog when you were a kid Victor Vincent Vincent Vincent Vincent Vincent?
5392460	5394460	I'm just listening Vincent
5394460	5399460	Did you have a dog? Yeah, how long was his hair? Yeah
5399460	5402460	Who was involved in its upkeep? Did you cut it?
5403460	5408460	I had a dog of a barber. I had a cat a cat. Hell. Yeah, how long are his ears?
5409460	5411460	So many good people
5412460	5418460	Did you uh, did you cut your cat's hair? Yeah, was it a short hair or a long hair hairless medium medium?
5418460	5421460	So did you okay, did you did you brush it?
5422460	5427460	That response by the way people are gonna listen to this podcast ten years where they're gonna think cats are going extinct
5430460	5435460	Oh my god, it's like Bojack Horseman like cats
5437460	5439460	All right, anyways
5439460	5444460	That is good. I know I know who we are now. I know whatever I know what's going on now. All right, I
5445460	5447460	Don't know what's going on anymore
5447700	5450860	Well brings you here from Germany Vincent this show
5450860	5456140	Oh, this is the only thing how long are you out here for a while two days? Okay, so you're about to go back
5456140	5461820	Yeah tomorrow morning really just coming up pilgrimage here for this show. Yeah. I mean I made some stops
5461820	5466140	I was in Berlin previously and now I mean the balance in Germany, obviously, right?
5467220	5472260	Yeah, that's not where I live. Have you been listening to this show for how long yeah
5472260	5478140	I think I started at about episode hundred one hundred and then I made my way down and up and now I'm here
5478660	5479940	Hell yeah
5479940	5485860	What's it? Here's the thing about ending this show? All right. What what? Oh, you didn't know
5487860	5489860	He's not on the emails I
5491420	5494760	Went to the vet once I had a cat late was like
5495760	5497760	Now you guys are over cats
5497760	5504240	I remember the vet like now they don't even care about cats saying to me the vet was like as if I think the vet was like
5504880	5510480	He must have like had this conversation with so many people because I really didn't cue him to do this speech
5511160	5513600	but he it seemed like he's just like
5514560	5520400	So he so wanted people to understand this that I almost thought he was like a cat murderer
5521600	5523600	But he was like, you know
5525560	5532120	If your cat's sick, it's not human. So it's not gonna let you know. It's not gonna be like oh, I'm sick
5532880	5534880	you know and then
5535480	5539800	You take the cat home and it's like curled up in its favorite Sunray
5540400	5542400	what and it's like
5543160	5546080	It's like wagging its tail now this guy didn't know anything about cats
5547400	5553280	No, but he was like he was like your cat acts like your cat and then it's like you don't want to put it down
5553280	5556800	But he was like this was a guy who was like pro putting my cat down
5556800	5559080	He was like he was letting me know it's like yeah
5559080	5564160	Here's the thing once you decide to put your cat down your cat's gonna start acting like a normal cat
5564160	5566160	You still got to put it down
5566440	5570480	Why did I bring that story of you were talking about the show and I know
5571160	5576520	That's a horrible but that's gonna make anyone happy. Like what do you wear a seat? Yeah, the show feels healthy
5577320	5579320	You gotta put it like
5579800	5585440	Cody Cody's dog Barbara is like riddled with cancer and it has been for a while
5585440	5589160	And it's like we're saying goodbye to Barbara and like she's going to die
5589640	5592080	like it and it's like
5592760	5597280	She's like wagging her tail and she's like running all over the place and like it's like
5598000	5606480	Fuck man. It's like knowing that she's going to die is like making her seem even healthier than if we didn't know that
5606880	5612680	Yeah, that's such a weird thing podcast because there's always like you were saying like the doctors or whatever. They're always like, oh man
5612680	5615920	It's okay. You know, it's it's word. It's torture to leave them alive
5615920	5621760	It's like well, it would be great to actually ask the pet like oh, would you like to be ceased right now?
5621760	5629120	Or do you want to keep feeling pain for another terrible couple weeks because like you're it's all just trying to assuage the guilt
5629120	5632500	But it's like no you are ending their life and that's crazy if you think about it
5632620	5638060	But you we had talked about this and you had said something that really stuck with me which is that we as
5638580	5643500	Like you genesis who have been mastering the dog race forever
5643540	5649300	Like we have like there's not a dog alive that we haven't tampered with genetically and I'm a big scholar of you Genesis
5649300	5650180	the
5650180	5655420	The dogs that we have created. There's no biological profit in them
5655940	5661380	Registering pain or expressing it like dogs that said ow
5663140	5666860	Gone like they're not in the gene pool right dogs that
5667380	5670780	When their leg is broken are like can I have a cookie?
5671780	5676380	Those are all of the progenitors of our species. Anyways, what's it like in Pakistan? I don't know
5677220	5681020	Does it bug you when people when guys like I go Pakistan?
5681020	5686420	Okay, I don't want to take the leap and go start going Pakistan. No, no, no, it sounds weirder when you say pop. Okay
5686420	5688420	Thank you. Yeah, god damn it. Can I
5688940	5691120	Can you give me a card that says like?
5692500	5698180	Because I just feel like a bag of dicks. I'm like like, yeah, I know it's Pakistan at this point, but I'm like Pakistan
5698900	5703500	That's not your fault. All right. Thank you. Oh, it's like when you talk to someone from nigga, wagwa nigga
5707660	5711220	So many hard hours in there, yeah, you got a lot
5712900	5717860	Anyways, so what let's squash this beef between Germany and Pakistan
5717860	5719860	I
5719860	5725940	Play some soccer you guys. What do you do in Germany? Are you studying as well? Yes, I studied journalism
5727700	5732660	That's why I was gonna bring up when she's talking about architecture I majored in journalism and I
5733620	5737440	Like very quickly like my first year of journalism. I was like
5738060	5742420	Journalism sucks. Yeah, I didn't have a fallback. So I dropped out of college
5742620	5743980	Yeah
5743980	5748940	You're not gonna though. No, no, I'm German journalists. I'm gonna finish it and but I mean, yeah
5748940	5753260	It sucks right now. Everybody keeps just keep telling me how you're not gonna get any money
5753260	5758360	You're not gonna get a job. No, you could be like you could work for BuzzFeed. Yeah, right. We have that in Germany
5758900	5763980	Is your media like ours? Do you guys have a no sensationalized? It's not as extreme
5763980	5769860	I mean, it is obviously emotionalized, but it's not I mean you guys everyone makes fun of Fox News
5769900	5774100	But even if I look at MSNBC, I think all I've seen and it's like
5774820	5777300	It's still extreme. That's what's so crazy
5777300	5783700	People are like Fox News is bad and then the Fox News watchers are like, no, you don't understand CNN's the fake news
5783700	5786700	It's like no, it's a whole fucking nightmare hellscape
5789340	5793280	Anywhere else in the world, it's like oh there's news actually there's a real news
5794100	5798820	It's bad. Is there real news? Yeah, BBC's better, but it's so boring. Yeah
5800420	5802340	That's the secret
5802340	5806480	Instead of like a supervillain. They're so they're so busy pronouncing Nicaragua, right?
5807860	5809860	I mean, where's the fucking hits?
5810940	5815060	What's going on over there nazi-wise? Come on be real. I mean it's coming back, right?
5815540	5821260	Cities it Dresden is fucking overrun. It's fucked up. They declared a national emergency or a city emergency
5821580	5825780	They're like we got skinheads folks. Yeah, I think that that was another city
5825780	5829860	But we just had an election and they were second largest force. Yeah
5829860	5835100	Yeah, I mean we're toast then all right if we can't count on you guys
5836060	5837500	to be
5837500	5838660	Nazaphobic
5838660	5840500	We're fucked
5840500	5845940	Right. I mean, it's all of Europe and America. It's the whole way. Why do you think as a journalist?
5845940	5851580	Yeah, what why do you think as a planet? I have my theory. Why do you think as a planet?
5851580	5856500	It's just like almost unrelated Lee. It just seems like all of these nations are just
5857340	5859140	sliding, right
5859140	5864260	Do you have a theory about that or I probably you wouldn't be a journalist if you were like good
5864260	5868580	It's because of Christmas, but I can't think of it now. I think it's because of the fucking internet
5868580	5872860	I mean, that's it right. I think the internet is simulated. That's certainly part of it
5872860	5878460	Like I think people people who were just in a little bubble or maybe just one guy in a village now
5878460	5884820	He is connected to typically people historically people when they like nations when they go
5885460	5887460	multicultural when their
5887500	5890220	economy is destabilized like there's certain like
5890700	5894060	cues that people start sliding right because they have an
5894780	5898580	Authoritarianistic instinct when they start to get threatened they start to have that
5899340	5901340	xenophobic here like the
5902140	5904140	You weren't finished. No, no, I
5905020	5910820	Comma semi-colon whatever and I my the rest of my thought would be the internet has made
5911220	5914260	Everyone feel like that's happening, but it's not happening
5915020	5917860	Because people like oh my god, I didn't know how many Muslims there are
5917860	5922860	It's like there aren't any Muslims where you are like like you just got on Facebook for the first time calm down. Yeah
5922860	5924620	yeah, it's like
5924620	5926260	every time the
5926260	5932180	Parts of the countries where these parties are active where those numbers are the most extreme
5932340	5935260	There's like none of the problems that they're running on. Yeah
5935780	5942580	It's it's where all the cities where people are stacked up on top of each other. You can't stay racist of living, New York
5943940	5949140	It's not really that possible. Yeah, I mean okay it is some people rise
5952420	5959900	Really you can't like hold on to these fucking crazy theories and be stacked on top of each other these giant cities where people are
5960300	5961820	functioning and like
5961820	5967940	generating all of the shit that keeps the lights on for the rest of the country and it's like this this age old irony that
5967940	5971420	Then you go out to the sticks. Sorry. No offense
5971420	5977620	What the fuck ever but it's like where there's like three people per square mile and those people are like
5978060	5983620	Absolutely the most convinced that the world is ending and that race mixing is gonna make everything
5983620	5988460	It's like that and they're like dude you your grandpa's birthday is the last time you saw anyone
5989100	5990420	Yeah
5990420	5993700	Well, they're fine. I think in New York and stuff
5993700	5998560	It's like it's the same kind of thing, but it's just like those the the internet kind of lets you
5999140	6003980	Hold on to these crazy theories without being challenged in the same way that you know
6004060	6006180	Your your face isn't rubbed into it
6006180	6011060	And that's what we didn't anticipate is that we don't want to evolve and I'll and we should all cop to that
6011060	6013060	I will like I don't want to be wrong
6013180	6016620	I got a I got a world of knowledge at my fingertips
6016620	6019640	but as I've said in this podcast before like I'll sit in a bar and go like
6020500	6027900	Hudson Hawk that was 1993. No, no, but you $50. No one gets their phone out because no one wants to actually know
6028540	6034140	Anything I think we do not actually want to use the internet to become like cyber Christ
6034140	6039540	We don't we don't want to like learn and of course stuff north. We could easily just know everything
6039620	6041820	We don't say stuff. No, I did say stuff
6043020	6045020	That's a reference to this podcast
6045540	6052260	Stup stub no, there's an episode called cyber Christ and stub north and I want to say Matt gorley was involved
6052780	6054780	All right kids. What are you plugging?
6059380	6062220	You got a book coming out about architecture I
6064420	6067900	Want to make it worth your while I don't I'm babbling and like oh god
6069580	6074580	Almost there. Yeah, it's already worth my while. I'm I'm good. I'm so I'm so flattered
6074580	6081180	Thank you for expressing that you too. Like it's it's it's that's why I brought up the dying dog thing
6082740	6088100	It what it wasn't to discourage the show can't tell us it's hurting it was like
6091420	6096340	It's like yeah, okay the show of course like goddamn what could the show just be ending forever
6097060	6102660	We'll launch another podcast called the Harbin town's ending and then we'll just do that forever and like well
6102660	6104780	Then everyone be on their best behavior. I
6106420	6112380	Don't know. I just want to say my accent sounds really German now that I oh
6112740	6117020	It's cool though. You didn't know that no, I didn't you never heard you
6118020	6122700	I'm so glad you said that I was thinking that the whole time does he know
6123460	6125780	You're like, oh my god. I sound like Dieter
6126580	6127900	I
6127900	6134180	Will you please say will you please say there are no more fucking cougarons? Mr. Johnson?

6143140	6145140	It'll work
6146940	6149140	But now Brandon is rock hard right now
6150220	6156220	You guys can't see he's rock hard. He's throbbing. Can you fully torqued as long as you're doing requests
6157060	6161140	Can you give me an evil laugh and then say?
6162140	6164140	diplomatic immunity
6167580	6169580	Okay, I can
6170580	6172580	Not you there's the evil laugh
6173660	6175660	diplomatic immunity
6176940	6179900	Bitch you think you can hide behind that shield, but I'm no Gibson. I'm gonna get you
6180820	6186340	I just got those bad guys were South African. How do you feel about South Africa as a German? Are you proud of it?
6186340	6191140	No, it's good. Yeah, it's Dutch. It's Dutch. Those are the Dutch. No, they're
6191940	6195420	Were they there first? Yeah. Yeah. Look at you bragging on oppression is shit
6196220	6198220	No, no, we got there first
6200460	6201980	It's good
6201980	6207420	Have any Imperial territories as Pakistan like oh, yeah, we ran Portugal for a while
6207460	6209740	There's no we we were run by the British
6212260	6216260	Do you wait wait did so did Pakistan have to like fight for its independence?
6216260	6222900	Oh, it was part of India and then when the British left they were like fuck you guys what do you want? And then?
6223620	6227460	Pakistan was like, oh we want to be separate and then there's this like fine. Whatever. Okay
6228580	6231980	That's kind of what happened here except there were muskets except for the nuke issue
6232340	6237820	Guys kind of will nuke each other right India and Pakistan. It's crazy. Oh, yeah, Pakistan. Well, yeah forever
6237820	6242420	Like yeah, you you guys are a nuclear power. I say you guys like you you
6243180	6248060	But like Pakistan's been a nuclear power forever, right? Yep. Yeah, they got that hard power
6248780	6250420	Yeah
6250420	6251540	Pele
6251540	6253540	Nice. Yes. Yeah
6253900	6261580	But it's never been a crisis that what when did Pakistan become a nuclear power? When was it 70s 80s?
6262060	6268720	I think 70s and like why wasn't that a crisis was that because we were on good terms with them
6269020	6275820	So was that America did America go like yeah, you guys should have nuclear bombs like that's not like us at all
6276820	6279900	Typically when you colonize a place you invite people to come back
6279900	6285860	They learn the same things that they're taught so you have a bunch of new engineers then why doesn't Alaska have the nukes man?
6286860	6288860	God damn it
6289900	6297140	It just doesn't it seems like such a weird outlier as I remember like during the Iraq war the first one it was like
6297740	6303540	Pakistan was like this like wild card. It was like, oh, are they gonna get involved like they're like US allies and like we don't
6303540	6306220	Yeah, I don't know. Whatever man. So fucking drunk
