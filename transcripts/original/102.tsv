0	29000	Hello Hollywood. Hollywood, California. Meltdown comics. There's no theater.
29000	36000	Sing it Freddie. Guess what everybody? Harman Town is now in section.
36000	44000	Welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
44000	52000	Thank you.
52000	58000	A weird thing happened there because I heard cheering and I was preoccupied.
58000	60000	We're relaxed now. We've done a lot of these shows.
60000	67000	I was just coming in and I thought for a second because I heard cheering and then I heard silence.
67000	77000	Then I looked and I thought I ran up halfway because I thought you had introduced me and I was lagging.
77000	81000	Then I came up halfway and froze like a rabbit.
81000	87000	Then you finished introducing me during which I slinked back like a cobra.
87000	90000	Then I sprang up.
90000	98000	It was the podcast introduction equivalent of two guys in the men's room doorway when you don't know.
98000	103000	Normally I try to keep the thing rolling and you know logically when it's time for you to come up.
103000	110000	I was moved by a queen musical interlude to pause for a moment.
110000	115000	Or as they say in music I went tacit.
115000	121000	Jeff, you know how the people have the what would Jesus do? It's a question they ask themselves.
121000	126000	It keeps them on point in a Christian sense.
126000	130000	What would Jesus do? It's a yardstick. It's a guideline.
130000	143000	I decided today this morning I have a new Twitter guideline which is why is Tony Danza following me?
143000	147000	How do I make that keep happening?
147000	149000	How long has he been following you?
149000	152000	I'm not sure. Was there a way to know that?
152000	156000	Can you date stamp when somebody started following you?
156000	162000	That sounds like an invasion of privacy that I don't think this society would put up with.
162000	168000	How do you use why is Tony Danza following me as a yardstick of morality?
168000	173000	You know how when you're in an argument you should stop and take deep breaths?
173000	181000	It's like letting your out and out. Whatever shit you're in, just step back and imagine Tony Danza is watching.
181000	185000	For me, maybe it's a different person for you guys.
185000	191000	It's not because I'm afraid of letting Tony Danza down, but I also don't have contempt for him.
191000	197000	He's kind of like the ultimate stranger, the ultimate boss.
197000	204000	I'm not sure if he's the boss, but I don't know. It's just the idea that Tony Danza...
204000	216000	It would be a nightmare for me to have Tony Danza be reading me, getting into arguments about political correctness or something with a 17-year-old or something.
216000	220000	Well, not my worst nightmare, but it's a nightmare that keeps you in check.
220000	224000	Tony Danza's picking out his shirt and he's looking through his phone and he's like,
224000	227000	Yeah, I don't need this.
227000	231000	I mean, I think I didn't buy a ticket to this right.
231000	236000	There's a possibility that you've done something right to make Tony Danza follow you,
236000	242000	and then maybe you could cross a line and do something that would make him not follow you so that you could use that as a moral compass.
242000	251000	What would Tony Danza unfollow me for doing? That's what I'm saying, yeah.
251000	256000	So anyways, I don't know. Just give it a shot and see if it changes your behavior this week.
256000	260000	But there's no control group. We don't know what you did that made him follow you. It might have been bad behavior.
260000	264000	We don't know. He might have been like, I like that guy. He's bad.
264000	272000	He's like me. He's like young Tony Danza. He's got spunk.
272000	277000	Well, yeah. Somebody said there was a community episode where we referenced who's the boss and stuff,
277000	280000	but he's following like 1,300 people.
280000	284000	Oh, really? Yeah. So he casts a wide net.
284000	291000	But you know who else cast a wide net? Jesus.
291000	294000	He's a fisherman of followers. Yeah.
294000	303000	Yeah, there's that story about the two footprints and then Jesus says like, that was when I was checking my tumbler.
303000	307000	Dumb. That was dumb. But it was improvised, so it's allowed to be kind of dumb.
307000	312000	It was so close. If you didn't back off it, it would have stood as a good joke.
312000	318000	Yeah. Well, like if I hadn't put those Woody Allen hesitations in there, I don't know.
318000	323000	I think that's the salt on my steak, which is good for me. I like salty steak.
323000	330000	But you hesitate a lot. Yeah. Then that's always me salting my food, their food.
330000	334000	I'm putting a little pepper on it, but with my little stammers. I'm kind of like, I'm not sure about this.
334000	336000	They're premeditated? Oh, yeah.
337000	343000	All the time your stammering is a huge Woody Allen construct that you have a complete handle on.
343000	349000	Yeah. I could talk about anything as if I'm totally confident in myself, but no one likes that.
349000	355000	That's uncaring. Just to try it out. Let's spend the next three or four minutes where you never stammer.
355000	363000	Even if the show should suffer for us losing that timing.
363000	365000	To show you what I mean, I will do this for you.
365000	366000	All right. Nice and clean.
366000	369000	Moving on, can we continue with the rest of the podcast?
369000	371000	I would love to, Dan.
371000	373000	All right. Then we shall.
378000	381000	Moving on to our corrections section.
381000	386000	This is the moment of the show when we correct things that we've done wrong, Jeff, in the past.
386000	389000	Are you implying that we've ever said anything wrong?
389000	392000	Even things that we think we might have done wrong is worth a correction.
392000	395000	It tells the people listening that we care.
397000	400000	And by uh, I don't mean uh.
401000	404000	You have to say like, oh, I'm one positive.
404000	411000	Our first correction is this is the thing that I wanted to correct last week, Jeff.
411000	415000	Remember when I mentioned that guy that said that the podcast got him through Hurricane Sandy?
415000	416000	Yes.
416000	421000	To me it sounded when I listened to it as if I was rolling my eyes when I described it a little bit.
421000	423000	Do you remember what I'm talking about?
423000	430000	When I listened back to it, to me it sounded as if I was mocking or ironic about how I appreciated the guy
430000	434000	and how much he liked Harmontown and how he said it had gotten him through Hurricane Sandy.
434000	437000	I had a certain patois in my voice.
438000	440000	Our sarcassipatois.
441000	446000	I said, at the end of it, I said, and it got him through Hurricane Sandy.
446000	449000	It sounded like my head was wiggling and my eyes were rolling.
449000	451000	And that was absolutely not the intention.
451000	453000	I was very flattered by this gentleman.
453000	454000	I spoke with him in the parking lot.
454000	456000	I had a wonderful time with him.
456000	460000	So wherever you are, mister, whatever your name is, I love you.
460000	461000	What's that?
461000	462000	Someone say something?
462000	463000	And of course not.
463000	465000	This is a very structured show.
466000	470000	And so far, so far, no stutters.
470000	471000	Yeah.
471000	473000	And don't you think it's gotten more boring?
473000	474000	No, no, no, no, no.
474000	475000	Less charming?
475000	476000	Don't you trust me less?
476000	477000	No, no, no, no, no.
477000	478000	I sound like Walter Cronkite.
478000	484000	I actually think the show is better when it's clearer and there's more articulation.
484000	486000	It's making me very nervous.
486000	491000	Well, what we've created is a balloon full of tension.
491000	494000	And the moment you stutter, it's going to be a big thing.
494000	495000	You're letting it out.
495000	497000	It's like a tantrum when you stutter.
497000	498000	Oh, boy.
498000	500000	All right.
500000	503000	Moving on to our next topic.
503000	505000	Ah, yes.
510000	515000	Is this a topic where you go back in time and talk like somebody from the 1890s?
515000	518000	Well, this is how people talk when they're not stuttering.
518000	520000	They talk like words are scripted.
520000	522000	Oh, you're on thin ice.
522000	523000	When you start riffing.
523000	525000	When you start riffing.
525000	531000	Jeff, I was very amused to have a Twitter exchange on Twitter today.
536000	540000	In speaking about net neutrality, I threw out what I thought was a reasonable metaphor.
540000	543000	I was trying to behoove people.
543000	546000	God damn it.
547000	552000	I was trying to get people to understand the importance of gatekeeping within media
552000	560000	by using the example of pre-Lutheran Vatican endorsed Latin Bible.
566000	571000	To be quite honest, I haven't heard a thing you said since you weren't stuttering
571000	574000	because I'm trying to be the stutter cop right now.
574000	576000	Well, listen to what I'm saying, Jack.
576000	577000	All right.
577000	578000	Jeff.
578000	582000	I reached in warning about the...
582000	584000	You made me do that.
584000	586000	I said in warning to...
586000	589000	I had max headroomed on the in warning because of what you said about counting my stutters.
589000	592000	If I'm conscious of you counting my stutters, I'm going to stutter.
592000	594000	Now I'm not. I let it go.
594000	595000	All right.
595000	598000	All I'm saying is that now I have the song queued up if you do stutter.
598000	602000	There is a musical sting that might happen.
602000	604000	I might have to speak more slowly.
604000	606000	What? Take a breath.
606000	610000	Don't tell me what to do.
610000	613000	You see how good that felt and how good that sounded?
613000	614000	Normally...
614000	617000	Don't tell me what to do.
617000	622000	When I start stuttering again, I'd like to talk about that impression
622000	625000	and how hurtful it is.
625000	628000	But right now, I'm cool as a cucumber.
628000	632000	I know everything I'm about to say, even before I say it.
632000	635000	What if you made it through the whole show and never stuttered?
635000	637000	It would be boring, is my prediction.
637000	638000	I see. I think not.
638000	640000	I think it would lose something.
640000	645000	I think it would be like eating a boiled yam as opposed to a fresh, crisp...
645000	647000	Right out of the ground.
647000	657000	Everyone loves a dirty, raw, wonderful, earth-nurtured yam.
657000	661000	Just put the bug still on it. Pull it out of the ground.
661000	665000	Asking the question, why did we ever boil yams?
665000	667000	These things don't need our help.
667000	670000	This is a hate crime boiling this yam.
670000	672000	This thing was perfect.
672000	674000	God wanted this in my mouth.
674000	680000	I can't believe he grew it in the ground.
680000	684000	Normal people say, uh, sometimes.
684000	687000	We're not going to call us or stutter.
687000	689000	We're talking about the...
689000	692000	Dan, I'm only going to bust you on...
692000	695000	I'm not bust you. I'm only going to throw the flag on the play.
695000	696000	When it goes off the rails.
696000	697000	When you go...
697000	699000	Also, I do that too.
699000	700000	Alright.
700000	703000	Someone just laughed like that.
703000	707000	Guys, laugh as a stutter.
707000	709000	Okay, what were we talking about?
709000	710000	Could you please remind me?
710000	712000	Net neutrality.
712000	713000	Latin.
713000	716000	Latin Bible's net neutrality. Thank you very much.
716000	718000	You scattered people.
718000	725000	Must be strange to be so unfocused.
725000	729000	I bet you wish you could speak publicly.
729000	735000	Anyhow...
735000	738000	Speaking about net neutrality on Twitter today,
738000	744000	I used that metaphor for the dangers of gatekeeping in society.
744000	748000	Remember when Bibles were only in Latin?
748000	750000	Poor people couldn't know Latin.
750000	754000	You had to access God through another class of people.
754000	758000	I didn't think anybody thought that that was ever a good thing.
758000	765000	This guy took exception to my comments, which I found amazing.
765000	766000	Which guy?
766000	768000	This guy. Just a guy.
768000	772000	I mean, I have 250,000 followers.
772000	778000	You'd expect that if I talked about...
778000	781000	Bragglebrag.
781000	786000	Excuse me, sir.
786000	790000	My intention was not to hurt your feelings.
790000	791000	What do you mean, which guy?
791000	798000	Believe me, sir, the volume of my followership...
798000	801000	It mitigates the quality of my life.
801000	803000	It's a burden I bear.
803000	807000	I'm not bragging, I'm complaining.
807000	809000	If I were to talk about zebras...
809000	813000	By trying not to stammer, you get a little British.
813000	816000	I'm thinking about what I'm saying, and I'm not going to...
816000	819000	Maybe you get Game of Thrones, your favorite British character,
819000	822000	and see if that elongates your vowels and helps you out.
822000	823000	Don't, come on.
823000	825000	I'm just trying to help, man.
825000	827000	It seems like you're not trying to help.
827000	829000	I am. No, I'm absolutely trying to help.
829000	834000	It seems like you're camp Mohawk in meatballs, and I'm doing a teacup race.
834000	839000	For two people, two people.
839000	844000	A lot of gray-haired men pumping their fists right now.
844000	846000	And by a lot, I mean two.
846000	850000	No, no. I'm definitely the evil ski instructor right now.
850000	854000	You can't make it down the slope, Dan.
854000	856000	Don't frazzle me.
856000	859000	I'm trying to help. I swear to God.
859000	871000	This young gentleman was, to me, absurdly defensive of the Holy Roman Empire.
871000	874000	I thought I had seen everything.
874000	877000	We are getting dangerously close to the day,
877000	880000	and you'll call this an exaggeration.
880000	883000	Some people will call this offensive in and of itself,
883000	886000	but it feels as though we are getting dangerously close to the day
886000	891000	when someone's finally, once and for all, going to say on the internet,
891000	894000	I'm sick and tired of this Hitler metaphor being a can,
894000	897000	we can just kick whatever we want.
897000	902000	Hitler this, Hitler that, like he's just the definition of bad.
902000	906000	How do you think that makes me feel as a Hitler lover?
906000	910000	We're getting pretty close to that because this guy was,
910000	912000	he was up in arms.
912000	915000	He said, uh...
915000	917000	No, I was okay.
920000	923000	He said...
923000	931000	His point was that he is a Catholic churchgoer
931000	939000	According to his biography on Twitter, he's a polyglottal glottist.
939000	941000	What do they call themselves?
941000	943000	Polyglott, yes.
943000	945000	Who speaks multiple languages?
945000	948000	One of them being Latin.
948000	950000	He goes to Latin Mass.
950000	954000	He's tired of this stereotype, I think,
954000	964000	where people that speak Latin are just a bunch of assholes.
964000	968000	And the world history idea that we all learned in world history,
968000	971000	maybe this is an American thing, maybe this guy lives in Frankfurt,
971000	973000	maybe he lives in Rome, I don't know.
973000	978000	But it made me think, holy cow, really anything,
978000	982000	no sooner have you conquered something than something becomes the underdog,
982000	991000	I was kind of not realizing that I was just using the Vatican as a whipping boy
991000	995000	because I thought no one could get offended.
995000	998000	But what about people who love the Vatican?
998000	1001000	There's a million of them.
1001000	1004000	There's a couple hundred million of them, I'm sure.
1004000	1007000	A billion?
1007000	1010000	Are you on the side of the Catholic church now?
1010000	1015000	I have always been on the side of anyone who wants to atone with the unknown
1015000	1017000	through a religion of their choosing.
1017000	1022000	I would never want to be guilty of impinging on anyone's freedom of religion.
1022000	1023000	I think that's terrible.
1023000	1027000	That's why I've stood up here before and it's been kind of weird minefield
1027000	1030000	because we have a very intelligent group of kids who come to us.
1030000	1033000	By the way, I love you guys.
1033000	1036000	You're my kids.
1036000	1039000	Except for the four gray-haired guys who know meatballs.
1039000	1042000	Also my children.
1042000	1044000	And I theirs.
1044000	1048000	I learned from you guys, we are a happy family.
1048000	1051000	I would never change a single one of you.
1051000	1053000	Except Keith in the back.
1053000	1055000	I'm just kidding.
1055000	1058000	There's no Keith.
1058000	1060000	Are there any Keiths in the night?
1060000	1062000	Wow.
1062000	1067000	I went to Duncan Trussell's live podcast at the improv.
1067000	1074000	I talked a little bit about God there and I got applauded for it.
1074000	1076000	You guys give me a hard time.
1076000	1084000	You're very atheistic, very intelligent, very skeptical people.
1084000	1085000	It's very strange.
1085000	1089000	I imagine there's going to be a huge overlap between Duncan's audience and this audience.
1089000	1090000	What did you say about God there?
1090000	1094000	Maybe they would have applauded the same monologue here.
1094000	1103000	You tried to start your own religion a while ago and you were roundly booed for that.
1103000	1112000	I guess on Duncan Trussell's show you came in a little lower than Jim Jones.
1112000	1117000	I can't, while speaking smoothly, I can't interject and jackhammer you out of this.
1117000	1118000	Dan, you're off the hook.
1118000	1120000	You made it.
1120000	1129000	That's the music that would have played if you had stuttered.
1129000	1132000	Mocking's Asylum music.
1132000	1134000	What was that?
1134000	1136000	What was that?
1136000	1146000	You made it a good what, 10, 15 minutes?
1146000	1148000	I don't like that guy.
1148000	1153000	That seems like a boring old school radio.
1153000	1160000	Because it was so measured, it sounded really intimidating that you were holding something back that might have...
1160000	1163000	You were not saying what you really meant.
1163000	1166000	It was scary.
1166000	1168000	I prefer the other version.
1168000	1172000	You want to know what's for sale here, what's going on behind my ears.
1172000	1175000	No one came here because I went to broadcasting school.
1175000	1183000	I did not slave for hours, years, decades, millennia in the stand-up minds.
1183000	1186000	You notice that you haven't stuttered since we stopped.
1186000	1189000	It's like, I'll do it on purpose, but whatever.
1189000	1196000	But I'm just saying, when I want to find the words, whatever.
1196000	1198000	How did we get on this?
1198000	1200000	It wasn't us making fun of you stammering.
1200000	1202000	I stammer and stutter and mumble and all kinds of shit.
1202000	1204000	It was an experiment.
1204000	1206000	All right.
1206000	1208000	That's not all right.
1208000	1211000	God and atheism and females.
1211000	1212000	Right.
1212000	1213000	Well, yeah.
1213000	1215000	I mean, you guys...
1215000	1222000	Wait, you're accusing this crowd of hating you loving God or hating you hating God?
1222000	1224000	Our crowd has a little bit...
1224000	1230000	Duncan talks a lot about religious pursuits on his podcast.
1230000	1232000	He has religious experiences.
1232000	1240000	He's really into Ram Dass and eating things that make you see that sheep are watching and whatever.
1240000	1242000	He reads books.
1242000	1244000	Or that Mushroom Jesus thing?
1244000	1245000	Yeah.
1245000	1248000	And so his crowd includes more...
1248000	1261000	I think the fringe of his audience, I picture as being genuinely almost tie-dyed in silhouette.
1261000	1263000	Tie-dyed in silhouette?
1263000	1265000	I was trying to think of tie-dyed in...
1265000	1267000	That's the most poetic thing you've ever said.
1267000	1269000	I should have just said tie-dyed.
1269000	1278000	And then the fringe of our audience, I think, has actual surgically augmented pointed ears.
1278000	1281000	These are fringes, and I love all of those people.
1281000	1285000	I don't know who of those two I love more, but those two...
1285000	1291000	And sometimes you might see a really nice, fun road movie about those two having to cross the country together.
1291000	1296000	They often travel in the same circles because neither of them would judge each other.
1296000	1301000	But one guy is like, I beg to differ about the thing that you said the other day.
1301000	1303000	I did some research myself.
1303000	1308000	And then the other guy is like, yeah, that's what I keep saying. Let's get naked.
1308000	1311000	No, Keith, we're not...
1311000	1315000	Stop pushing your nude agenda.
1315000	1319000	You look great in tie-dyed. Leave it at that.
1319000	1325000	And I was just like, in that show, I don't know, we were talking about writing the creative process.
1325000	1332000	I got a little spiritual about it, and I felt less punished than I do here sometimes.
1332000	1335000	It's because you're smart.
1335000	1338000	Whereas Duncan Trussell's audience...
1338000	1340000	No, they're not the opposite of smart.
1340000	1344000	I was trying to make them feel better, not make other people feel worse.
1344000	1347000	I shouldn't have gone down this road.
1347000	1351000	Boy, that guy that defended Latin, what an asshole.
1351000	1356000	Wait, so his angle was he's tired of having Latin kicked around the block?
1356000	1360000	Yeah, I mean, I would happily do...
1360000	1367000	If somebody could pull up the Twitter conversation, we could do a love letters thing.
1367000	1370000	But I lack the facility. I think I'll...
1370000	1375000	I'm just looking at my Evernote thing, which I think is...
1375000	1380000	It's all tapped, except for Aaron went to this camp the last three days.
1380000	1383000	Aaron was at a special camp for hipsters.
1383000	1386000	I think...
1386000	1388000	It's called Cervalec.
1388000	1391000	That sounds dismissive.
1391000	1394000	I think it's better to say it was a camp for hipsters
1394000	1397000	instead of saying what it is so that you're silently in your head going,
1397000	1400000	so a hipster camp?
1400000	1402000	I think you can...
1402000	1408000	They were very activated, young, independent business entrepreneurs
1408000	1411000	who were teaching each other and learning from each other
1411000	1417000	how to live in a new world business-wise on the internet
1417000	1420000	and whittle and make s'mores.
1420000	1422000	They did camp stuff, but they were...
1423000	1426000	Yeah, they were doing camp stuff and having seminars and stuff.
1426000	1432000	But weirdly, counterintuitively, whereas if you go to XOXO,
1432000	1435000	it's like, holy shit, here's your hashtag, here's your thing.
1435000	1437000	I mean, because obviously we're fucking...
1437000	1439000	This conference is about technology.
1439000	1446000	We encourage you to gram it and tumble it and flip, flip it, flip its face nipple.
1447000	1449000	Flip its face nipple.
1449000	1452000	It's new. It's face nipple.
1452000	1456000	N-I-P-P-L.
1456000	1458000	But in brackets.
1458000	1462000	With a 2 after it for no reason.
1462000	1466000	But this place, they took their phones.
1466000	1467000	Where was this place?
1467000	1469000	And they never gave them back.
1469000	1472000	They had to whittle new phones before they were allowed to leave.
1472000	1474000	Until you tell me or Erin tells me otherwise,
1474000	1477000	I'm imagining they're all on TPs up in Big Bear.
1477000	1478000	It was Big Bear.
1478000	1479000	Really?
1479000	1480000	Yeah.
1480000	1483000	I know, because Erin left her luggage there.
1483000	1484000	And I said, where was this place?
1484000	1485000	I didn't even know where she was.
1485000	1487000	It occurred to me, like, what if she had gotten hurt?
1487000	1490000	Wait, you could bring luggage but not a phone.
1490000	1491000	And it's in Big Bear.
1491000	1492000	Yeah, you could bring...
1492000	1495000	You can bring your phone, but it's gone for three days.
1495000	1496000	Do you stay in a tent?
1496000	1500000	Well, that's a question she'll have to answer.
1501000	1505000	Also, I knew she'd come back with one good story.
1505000	1508000	My definition of a good story is always a lot of
1508000	1513000	schadenfreude and pain and just unfairness happening in front of everybody.
1513000	1516000	What's the name of this convention or this camp?
1516000	1518000	I want to know how it all began.
1518000	1520000	Is this the first or 17th year?
1520000	1522000	I want to know all about this.
1522000	1524000	Well, she'll give you all the details.
1524000	1525000	Why don't we just bring her up?
1525000	1526000	Erin, are you...
1531000	1533000	CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
1541000	1544000	I wish that had gone on for ten minutes.
1554000	1557000	World's best podcast!
1558000	1564000	She was staring off into space like an autistic six-year-old
1564000	1569000	while doing a Bobby Brown-derived hoochie...
1569000	1570000	Soul train.
1570000	1572000	...hoochie gyration.
1573000	1578000	But it was combined with a strange final episode of St. Elsewhere,
1578000	1583000	just gazing up to the point where I thought it was going to be one of those stories where...
1583000	1586000	And then we realized she was an insolent shock.
1586000	1587000	And we didn't know she would...
1587000	1589000	That's when we took her to the emergency room and they said,
1589000	1591000	she's been diabetic for six years.
1592000	1593000	Oh, boy.
1593000	1597000	At the last night of camp, there was a dance and it was future-themed.
1597000	1598000	So I dressed as...
1598000	1599000	All right, guys.
1600000	1601000	I dressed as...
1601000	1602000	I got so many questions.
1602000	1604000	I dressed as Barf from Spaceballs.
1605000	1608000	And I bought this giant...
1608000	1610000	A lot of Spaceballs fans.
1611000	1616000	I bought this giant cover-all thing in, like, 7X because I wanted...
1616000	1618000	I was going to stuff it, but I didn't.
1618000	1622000	And I realized halfway through the dance that you couldn't see my body moving.
1622000	1626000	Like, I was working so hard to dance, but it just looked like I was...
1629000	1630000	It's all covered up.
1630000	1631000	Like a bobblehead?
1631000	1632000	Yeah.
1632000	1635000	And I was drunk and I, like, took a rope and I was, like, trying to tie it around my waist.
1635000	1637000	And I was trying to explain to people, like, I've been dancing.
1637000	1639000	I've been cheating you of moves.
1640000	1644000	I've got to get a leash around them so I can take them around.
1644000	1646000	I've been jiggy the whole time.
1647000	1654000	So the camp, it's put on by this really great organization in L.A. called Unique L.A.
1654000	1656000	Is anyone familiar with Unique L.A.?
1656000	1658000	Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!
1662000	1663000	They have a building...
1663000	1665000	And the crowd went whaaa.
1665000	1669000	They have a building called the Unique Space in downtown L.A.
1669000	1674000	And it's just about, like, I don't know, cultivating community between, like, artists and entrepreneurs.
1674000	1677000	And they do a lot of, like, made in L.A. type things.
1677000	1680000	And so the camp is called the Unique Camp.
1682000	1684000	And it's a camp...
1684000	1692000	Their acronym is Cultivate Ambition Map Possibilities.
1693000	1694000	I mean, come on haters.
1694000	1695000	Chill out.
1695000	1696000	Chill out a little bit.
1696000	1697000	I tell you, they hate God, too.
1698000	1700000	Cultivate...
1700000	1702000	Cultivate Ambition Map Possibilities.
1702000	1703000	Just because they wanted to...
1703000	1705000	Basically, it's just people that love...
1705000	1706000	They wanted to spell the word camp.
1706000	1707000	It's people that love...
1708000	1711000	Chocolate, almonds, marzipan...
1711000	1712000	Creative.
1712000	1715000	...ambitious, multi-ethnic progress.
1717000	1723000	It's basically just this very fun camp-themed thing where different, like, creative people that are...
1723000	1726000	It's mostly, like, self-made people that are artists and business...
1726000	1728000	I really had no business being there, like, over...
1728000	1733000	I kept on changing my introduction because, like, in every group you have to say, like,
1733000	1736000	I'm so-and-so, and I founded Eco Shoes.
1736000	1739000	And I'm like, I'm Aaron, and I...
1739000	1740000	Invented calcium.
1742000	1746000	I was the fireman with the GoPro on his head when that kitten got oxygen.
1746000	1749000	I assume that was more viral than maybe it was.
1749000	1751000	No, it's pretty viral, yeah.
1751000	1752000	What was yours? What was yours, Aaron?
1753000	1755000	Jeff went, then I went.
1756000	1758000	Now it's your turn to make fun of you.
1761000	1763000	But it's very neat if you're...
1763000	1765000	Look it up, he makes space.
1765000	1767000	You said you changed your introduction.
1767000	1770000	What was the evolution of your introduction?
1770000	1772000	It says humiliating.
1773000	1777000	Well, I think my first introduction, I said, I do...
1777000	1779000	Hi, I'm Mary McGathey.
1779000	1784000	I mean, because of the truth, I went because I have all these different interests,
1784000	1786000	and I have my fingers in so many different pies,
1786000	1789000	and I guess technically I'm a freelancer, but I have my podcasts,
1789000	1793000	I'm performing, but I make things, and so I'm just trying to figure that all out.
1793000	1796000	So that's why I went, just for fun.
1796000	1798000	And I also love summer camp.
1799000	1801000	I just got back a couple hours ago.
1801000	1804000	I'm very sunburnt, and I feel a little woozy from the elevation.
1804000	1806000	What was the list of things that you introduced?
1806000	1808000	Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1808000	1812000	Driving up there in the car, your introduction that you had planned for it was what?
1812000	1817000	Well, I had no... I did not plan an introduction.
1817000	1820000	I was very intimidated by the groups because, like I'm saying,
1820000	1824000	there is an astronomer who studies black holes at Dartmouth,
1824000	1828000	and there is all these people that have created all these things,
1828000	1830000	a lot of you guys I'm sure use.
1831000	1833000	So I was like, hi, I'm Erin.
1833000	1837000	I do comedy and stuff, and sometimes I pick a cake, and I'm okay.
1841000	1845000	And then once I wrote something, I was like, I'm a writer,
1845000	1849000	but not really, not actively, but like, okay.
1851000	1853000	That's going to be so annoying to hear on the podcast.
1853000	1854000	I'm sorry, listeners.
1854000	1856000	I hate it when I do that Bobcat voice.
1858000	1860000	Yeah, so I refined it to...
1860000	1863000	I host a podcast called This Feels Terrible,
1863000	1864000	and I deal with these other things,
1864000	1866000	and I want to kind of bring them all together
1866000	1869000	and figure out how to cultivate the community of that.
1869000	1873000	All right, so, took Erin out to dinner.
1873000	1875000	They didn't take her out. She took me out.
1875000	1876000	Boy, took each other out.
1876000	1878000	You took me out. I paid for valet.
1878000	1879000	All right.
1879000	1880000	Yeah.
1882000	1886000	Yeah, I mean, we haven't been apart more than...
1886000	1888000	This is probably the longest we've ever been apart, right?
1888000	1890000	And definitely the longest without talking.
1890000	1893000	And I was so excited because I knew something.
1893000	1895000	There's got to be something.
1895000	1898000	And you did not disappoint after a lot of boring stuff
1898000	1901000	about this hunky astronomer guy that swept you off your feet.
1901000	1902000	Never.
1903000	1906000	His name is Kevin, and he's...
1907000	1908000	He's amazing.
1908000	1910000	He's going to be my next guest on This Feels Terrible.
1910000	1911000	He's really incredible.
1911000	1912000	He knows all this stuff about black holes,
1912000	1914000	and he's a huge fan of Rick and Morty and...
1914000	1917000	Which is supposed to make me feel good when he's fucking you.
1918000	1920000	Hi, honey. I'm...
1920000	1922000	You better love my cartoon, mister.
1926000	1928000	Finish up and get out of here.
1928000	1930000	Or stay. We'll play catchphrase later.
1932000	1935000	Oh, and Jeff, I made a bunch of people play catchphrase.
1935000	1936000	So alienated.
1936000	1937000	A lot of people have the rules.
1937000	1938000	Who ran it?
1938000	1939000	Well, come on.
1940000	1941000	All right, all right. So...
1941000	1942000	Anyway, anyway.
1942000	1943000	The horse story.
1943000	1944000	The horse story.
1944000	1945000	The horse story.
1945000	1946000	Okay, so...
1946000	1948000	To me, this is like a parable.
1949000	1950000	What happened?
1950000	1951000	I mean, you're building it up.
1951000	1953000	I'm going to make myself comfortable.
1954000	1956000	So, yesterday...
1960000	1961000	You know what, guys? I'm just going to be myself.
1961000	1963000	And myself wants to be comfortable.
1963000	1965000	So, yesterday...
1965000	1967000	Did you learn that at camp?
1969000	1972000	Technically, she learned it from Kevin under the stars.
1973000	1976000	Gravity is like just another stool under your feet.
1976000	1978000	That's Cassiopeia up there.
1978000	1980000	You know, she sacrificed herself for her lover.
1980000	1983000	Oh, I wish I knew someone with...
1987000	1989000	Speaking of holes.
1990000	1992000	Kevin, the stars aren't under my blouse.
1994000	1996000	Yeah, I definitely have the glow of...
1996000	1999000	Dan didn't recognize me when I came to the car.
1999000	2003000	Well, you were wearing this knit shawl.
2003000	2004000	Is that an accurate description?
2004000	2005000	Yeah.
2005000	2007000	Like a knit shawl in a baseball cap.
2007000	2009000	Because I won a scavenger hunt, so I got a baseball cap.
2009000	2010000	And I just...
2010000	2012000	I looked right at her and I...
2012000	2014000	And then just went right back to listening to Radiolab,
2014000	2017000	waiting for my fiancé to come to the car.
2017000	2018000	And then the car door opened.
2018000	2019000	I went, ah!
2019000	2023000	Because this knit shawl scavenger from Sector 7...
2024000	2028000	This person that was dressed unlike anything I'd ever seen Aaron in,
2028000	2030000	like, just coming into my car.
2030000	2031000	I was like, oh, my God!
2031000	2032000	You're not...
2032000	2034000	You're not the strange...
2034000	2035000	I don't know.
2035000	2038000	For some reason, I have no idea what happened,
2038000	2040000	but in my head, you were an Asian woman.
2042000	2045000	I just projected a race onto you.
2045000	2048000	I don't know if, to me, that's an Asian shawl,
2048000	2050000	or I don't know what was in my head, because obviously...
2050000	2053000	All those knit shawl ball cap wearing Asians?
2053000	2055000	Well, I mean, let's not...
2055000	2059000	So, like Dan was saying, at the camp,
2059000	2062000	there are all these camp activities that you could do
2062000	2064000	in addition to these workshops.
2064000	2066000	And I signed up for horseback riding,
2066000	2069000	and it was the last horseback riding session of the weekend.
2069000	2070000	This was last night.
2070000	2072000	And they said on the sheet,
2072000	2076000	come right at 5 o'clock, because, you know,
2076000	2078000	they didn't explain why.
2079000	2081000	Take our word for it.
2081000	2082000	You want to ride a horse?
2082000	2084000	There's an appointment involved.
2084000	2086000	And I was very excited, so I was like 10 minutes early,
2086000	2088000	and was looking at the horses
2088000	2091000	and imagining which one I would ride.
2091000	2094000	And there were like 10 other women
2094000	2096000	who showed up exactly on time.
2096000	2102000	We get this talk from the horse training person who says,
2102000	2104000	yeah, I'm so glad you guys are here on time,
2104000	2107000	because it's so important for us all to be here on time,
2107000	2109000	and I'll hear this explanation together,
2109000	2111000	because these horses are very particular.
2111000	2115000	And we get on these logs with, what do you call horse ropes?
2115000	2116000	Rain.
2116000	2117000	Rain.
2117000	2118000	Horse ropes.
2118000	2119000	Or leaders.
2119000	2120000	Rain.
2120000	2121000	Okay.
2122000	2123000	Horse ropes.
2123000	2125000	They should just call them horse ropes.
2125000	2128000	Well, I'm sure there's a lot of ropes you use with horses.
2129000	2131000	So we're sitting on these logs.
2131000	2135000	We go through this entire training session with this woman,
2135000	2139000	and we see somebody walking from the camp,
2139000	2143000	because the horse stuff is kind of far away from the bunks and everything.
2143000	2147000	We see someone walking, and the leader waves at her,
2147000	2151000	and she just kind of casually waves back,
2151000	2154000	and she does a hurry,
2154000	2157000	and the woman just walks at her same pace.
2157000	2159000	She's a very fit, athletic young woman,
2159000	2162000	just walking slowly while she's going over this thing.
2162000	2165000	So the instructor's like, okay, we'll move on.
2165000	2168000	Clearly, this person's just taking a walk and was waving.
2168000	2170000	Eventually, this woman arrives,
2170000	2173000	and she's come after the entire explanation,
2173000	2177000	and the leader, the horse instructor lady, said,
2177000	2181000	oh, she's about to say, sorry, you can't ride with us,
2181000	2185000	because you've missed the explanation, and we have to go now.
2185000	2186000	And she's like, hey.
2186000	2188000	And the woman's like, oh, don't worry.
2188000	2189000	I ride.
2189000	2190000	I'm very comfortable.
2190000	2192000	To the horse instructor lady.
2192000	2194000	And we're all like, oh, God.
2195000	2199000	Just very, so proud and so shitty and very comfortable.
2199000	2203000	And then the woman's like, oh, but you need to like,
2203000	2206000	I'll go over the stuff with you, because just legally you have to.
2206000	2212000	Even if she was an expert, like steeplechase Olympian,
2212000	2214000	we already know two things about this stranger.
2214000	2219000	One is that she may or may not know anything about horses,
2219000	2222000	but we know she knows nothing about group dynamics.
2222000	2226000	She has walked into a group of people who have,
2226000	2230000	she's 15 minutes late, and she's just announcing to all
2230000	2232000	of these strangers here, it's all right.
2232000	2234000	I'm an expert.
2234000	2237000	Also, I've been around enough horse lady instructors
2237000	2240000	to know that the first 15 minutes is all bullshit.
2240000	2243000	I'll get there when the horse ride starts.
2243000	2245000	Yeah.
2245000	2247000	The horses tend to learn a thing or two from me,
2247000	2249000	to tell you the truth.
2249000	2252000	And also like the instructions were a favor to all of us,
2252000	2254000	which they are.
2254000	2255000	As we will learn.
2255000	2256000	Yeah.
2256000	2261000	So we all were assigned horses, and as they're assigning horses,
2261000	2267000	the horse instructor lady, the hill, says,
2267000	2271000	it's very important when we go out that we stay in the line
2271000	2274000	that we go out in, because horses are like people,
2274000	2277000	and they dislike some horses, and they like other horses.
2277000	2279000	And some of these horses are very particular,
2279000	2282000	and it's very important that you stay in this specific line.
2282000	2284000	So we know that we get on our horse.
2284000	2287000	My horse's name is Bergen.
2287000	2290000	So we're sitting, sorry, I was just thinking about Bergen.
2290000	2291000	Bergen.
2291000	2292000	Bergen.
2292000	2294000	So we get on the horses, and I know that during this time,
2294000	2296000	she's going over this explanation with this woman who's ridden horses
2296000	2297000	and is very comfortable.
2297000	2302000	We get on the horses, there's a pin where you go in a circle
2302000	2305000	just so you get used to controlling your horse
2305000	2306000	and going in this line.
2306000	2311000	So she, the horse instructor lady leads us out in this line,
2311000	2313000	and we start going around in this circle.
2313000	2316000	I'm second in this line, and this woman who is very comfortable
2316000	2320000	on horses is kind of towards the back of this line of 10 horses.
2320000	2323000	We're going in this line, like from the very beginning,
2323000	2326000	the horse instructor lady is saying to the,
2326000	2328000	I'm going to call her Blondie.
2328000	2329000	She was blonde.
2329000	2333000	So she says to Blondie, no, no, you're out of line,
2333000	2337000	because her horse was going in the middle of the ring.
2337000	2340000	Everybody else is in this line, and this woman who's so familiar
2340000	2343000	and comfortable with horses, her horse is kind of veering out.
2343000	2346000	And the lady is like, no, no, no, you need to go back.
2346000	2347000	You need to go back.
2347000	2349000	And she's not, she's trying.
2349000	2350000	She says, you need to go back.
2350000	2354000	And then Blondie says, look, I heard you.
2354000	2359000	She's put off by all the, I ride already.
2359000	2360000	I don't know how to ride a horse.
2360000	2361000	I get it.
2362000	2365000	But the woman's like, no, this is actually important.
2365000	2367000	Is she leading a horse?
2367000	2369000	Is she coloring outside the lines?
2369000	2371000	I don't know.
2371000	2372000	Yeah.
2372000	2373000	She's like, you know what?
2373000	2374000	This is beginner shit.
2374000	2378000	This horse is going to ride an elephant while I ride the horse.
2378000	2381000	And while, because she's out of the line,
2381000	2386000	the order gets all fucked up because the horses are used to traveling
2386000	2387000	pretty close to each other.
2387000	2391000	So we're on our second go around this ring.
2391000	2393000	We're about to go out on the trail.
2393000	2395000	We're coming around the side of it.
2395000	2400000	And she's, the Blondie is trying to get her horse back into this line of horses.
2400000	2405000	And as she does that, she spooks the horse in front of her.
2405000	2406000	And the horse freaks out.
2406000	2408000	I've never seen anything like this.
2408000	2410000	The horse gets really scared.
2410000	2413000	And horses are big.
2413000	2414000	As big as a horse.
2414000	2416000	As big as a horse.
2416000	2420000	They could eat a smaller horse.
2420000	2423000	When they get hungry, they just lick their hooves.
2423000	2431000	So the horse gets super spooked and throws this nice mother off of the horse,
2431000	2433000	bucks, and she falls to the ground.
2433000	2437000	The horse is going, nah!
2437000	2438000	Try again.
2438000	2440000	Try again.
2440000	2442000	It's okay to get it wrong the first time.
2442000	2445000	We just find out you don't know it all.
2445000	2448000	Even in a speaking spell.
2448000	2452000	Just try to put yourself back in that moment and do the horse thing again.
2452000	2454000	I really thought I was going to have a Michael Winslow moment.
2454000	2456000	I thought that was going to be really amazing.
2456000	2457000	Just let it go.
2457000	2458000	Just try one more time.
2458000	2462000	The mother...
2462000	2463000	Okay.
2463000	2467000	Whoo-hoo!
2467000	2470000	I think that's a swamp horse.
2470000	2473000	I think there was a loon.
2474000	2476000	Certainly a loon.
2476000	2479000	So a woman is dead or maimed?
2479000	2483000	She gets thrown off the horse and everybody is silent
2483000	2485000	and the instructor is like,
2485000	2486000	Still!
2486000	2487000	Everyone be still.
2487000	2488000	Everyone be still.
2488000	2489000	Don't move.
2489000	2490000	Don't move.
2490000	2491000	She has to jump off her horse and calm down this horse
2491000	2497000	and keep her from smashing in this mother's head.
2497000	2499000	So she calms down the horses.
2499000	2500000	Everybody is silent.
2500000	2502000	She's still telling the woman to be quiet.
2502000	2506000	She takes the spooked horse back into the stable
2506000	2508000	and then we all follow suit.
2508000	2510000	This woman is still on the ground.
2510000	2513000	So we don't know if she's dead or if she's just being still
2513000	2516000	because she needs to be safe, obviously.
2516000	2519000	We get all our horses tied up and then she's...
2519000	2520000	I call out like,
2520000	2521000	Are you okay?
2521000	2523000	Not that I'm the hero, but...
2523000	2525000	I asked her if she was okay.
2525000	2526000	She was okay.
2526000	2529000	They called the medics over and she was fine.
2529000	2530000	She was bruised up.
2530000	2532000	She was just still because she was told
2532000	2533000	that she was supposed to be still.
2533000	2535000	And we get all tied up with the horses
2535000	2536000	and everyone is...
2536000	2539000	I mean, I don't know how everyone is feeling.
2539000	2541000	I was feeling so happy that this woman's head
2541000	2542000	wasn't smashed in.
2542000	2546000	And I hear Blondie on the other side of the stable say,
2546000	2548000	So are we not going out?
2548000	2556000	She can't get a break.
2557000	2560000	I had the shittiest day today.
2560000	2564000	They started horse class too early.
2564000	2568000	Then the bitch teaching it tells me I got to learn it anyway.
2568000	2571000	Then some other bitch's horse throws her off.
2571000	2574000	Like, when's it going to be Natalie time?
2574000	2578000	Natalie time.
2578000	2579000	What do you think her deal was?
2579000	2581000	Do you think that she used to ever ride a horse
2581000	2583000	or that she was cocky and she was just like,
2583000	2585000	or she just was full of shit?
2585000	2587000	Also, what business did she start?
2587000	2588000	I want to know about that too.
2588000	2591000	It's an overused term, but I'm going to go sociopath.
2591000	2596000	Her general problem is that she has no fucking empathy.
2596000	2599000	Or was she such a good horse?
2599000	2601000	There's a horse for anything.
2601000	2602000	I grew up around horses.
2602000	2605000	I've been riding horses since I was a little girl.
2605000	2610000	These trained horses, they don't want to ride in a line, man.
2610000	2612000	I'm going to go outside the line
2612000	2614000	and she fucked up and spooked the horses.
2614000	2618000	Did she fly too close to the sun or was she just a complete lunatic?
2618000	2620000	I don't know the answers to all those questions,
2620000	2623000	but I just want to say in response to that,
2623000	2626000	if she was any of that,
2626000	2629000	if it did come from a place of her being a horse expert
2629000	2631000	or anything like that,
2631000	2634000	she's also a sociopath just from her behavior.
2634000	2638000	No chimpanzee walks into a group of chimpanzees
2638000	2641000	where they're outnumbered and goes like,
2641000	2644000	hey, Jim here, out of my way.
2644000	2646000	Not sorry I'm late.
2646000	2649000	Sorry you're early.
2649000	2651000	Any mistakes will be on me
2651000	2656000	because no one would bother to write that insurance check.
2656000	2659000	And no concern for the woman that had fallen?
2659000	2660000	Was she okay?
2660000	2663000	She was okay, but no, that woman showed no concern.
2663000	2665000	She didn't connect those dots.
2665000	2668000	She didn't go, cause an effect.
2668000	2672000	Can't help but feel like it's a little bit on me.
2672000	2675000	The story would still, she'd still be a shitty person
2675000	2677000	even if at the end she was kind of like,
2677000	2682000	huh, I kind of feel like maybe I should have just come on time.
2682000	2684000	She'd still be like, yeah, fuck you.
2684000	2686000	But she didn't even do that.
2686000	2689000	She's like, you know, if this class is going to take any longer
2689000	2692000	and involve less full speed horse riding,
2692000	2694000	I want my money back.
2694000	2696000	So the end, the ride was over.
2696000	2698000	The riding was over.
2698000	2703000	Everybody left except for me and a couple other women
2703000	2707000	that wanted to hang out with the goats and the...
2707000	2709000	And there's like a little goat.
2709000	2711000	I think you buried the lead on this story.
2711000	2713000	There were these goats in this llama
2713000	2716000	that I had become kind of close to, so I was...
2716000	2718000	What's this camp called? A unique camp?
2718000	2720000	It is a unique camp.
2720000	2723000	What if it was just a dream I had?
2723000	2728000	So I have a quick beef that I didn't talk to you about.
2728000	2730000	But really quick, the reaction afterwards,
2730000	2732000	it was obvious what had happened,
2732000	2735000	but the way that everyone said to each other,
2735000	2738000	almost in a way to deal with the trauma,
2738000	2740000	oh, well, I heard horses just do that sometimes.
2740000	2742000	There's no predicting what happened.
2742000	2745000	Maybe a bee flew in the horse's nose.
2745000	2748000	But it was so clear what had happened,
2748000	2750000	and I kept on looking around at people's eyes,
2750000	2753000	like, is anyone else going to talk about this?
2753000	2754000	But no one else.
2754000	2757000	Even the woman that was injured, like, did it.
2757000	2758000	Really?
2758000	2760000	I think she knew.
2760000	2762000	She was injured?
2762000	2765000	Well, the woman who fell off, she was bruised up.
2765000	2767000	And she was very sweet, but she was very excited
2767000	2770000	that she was the one who got thrown off the horse.
2770000	2771000	Right.
2771000	2773000	Yeah, I mean, some people are happier
2773000	2775000	when they're the injured one.
2775000	2779000	Well, her business was thrownoffahorse.com,
2780000	2782000	but the blog, it's like...
2782000	2784000	Well, no, that's not fair.
2784000	2786000	She gets thrown off a horse each day.
2786000	2787000	I want to re-track that.
2787000	2789000	She was very sweet.
2789000	2791000	And then the woman that was the...
2791000	2793000	You're calling her sociopath.
2793000	2795000	She deals with luxury eyewear.
2795000	2796000	And she looks...
2796000	2798000	Case closed.
2798000	2800000	I didn't even say that as a thing, but all right.
2800000	2801000	So, sorry, what was your beef?
2801000	2804000	Oh, well, I saw Tom Kaufman
2804000	2806000	at the Rick and Morty's writer's room.
2806000	2808000	Because he's a writer there.
2809000	2810000	Yes.
2810000	2812000	I say yes, yes.
2812000	2814000	He looked on Instagram.
2814000	2816000	There were people...
2816000	2819000	Somebody took a photo at Unique Camp.
2819000	2820000	That's my beef.
2820000	2822000	Somebody had their phone.
2822000	2825000	Well, because Unique Camp and that whole scene,
2825000	2827000	they're very good with all their social media stuff.
2827000	2830000	There were 10 or 20 photographers the entire time,
2830000	2833000	but all the pictures from camp are already up.
2833000	2834000	And they were...
2834000	2837000	The people that were in charge of the camp were Instagramming.
2838000	2839000	Yeah.
2841000	2842000	I don't know.
2842000	2845000	A society where you can't Instagram,
2845000	2847000	but the government can.
2848000	2849000	Makes me nervous.
2849000	2854000	Erin, you said you changed your description of yourself.
2854000	2856000	What did it evolve to later on?
2856000	2857000	I already said.
2857000	2858000	Oh, you did?
2858000	2859000	Yeah.
2859000	2861000	Okay, I thought there was more evolution to that.
2861000	2862000	At the end, I was like,
2862000	2864000	Mmm, scuba.
2864000	2866000	I invented the space shovel.
2866000	2868000	Scuba surgery.
2868000	2870000	Now, did you come away from a...
2870000	2871000	Other than a good horse story,
2871000	2874000	did you come away with any insights or any knowledge?
2874000	2876000	Any good things you can apply to your life?
2876000	2877000	Yeah, absolutely.
2877000	2878000	Yeah.
2878000	2879000	Prove it.
2879000	2880000	Yeah.
2880000	2881000	Prove it.
2881000	2882000	Prove it?
2882000	2883000	I will.
2883000	2885000	You'll see in the next five years.
2885000	2889000	No, I mean, the thing I took away was just integrating all of my skills
2889000	2890000	into one finite thing.
2890000	2893000	And I was talking to Dan about a project I'm very excited about.
2893000	2895000	I'll tell you about it too.
2895000	2897000	Oh, thank you for applauding.
2897000	2899000	It's killing juice.
2899000	2900000	She got...
2903000	2904000	For the podcast listener,
2904000	2907000	I just said it's killing juice because people were applauding
2907000	2909000	a project without knowing what it was,
2909000	2911000	and Hitler was mentioned earlier.
2911000	2913000	I thought you said it's canned juice.
2915000	2917000	Okay, now that we're all at full disclosing,
2917000	2919000	I thought she said,
2919000	2920000	CUN JUICE.
2920000	2925000	I love that they're...
2925000	2928000	Can we combine all three of those things?
2928000	2930000	Look, I know I have something going on,
2930000	2932000	really great going on here, and I've got to share it.
2932000	2934000	I invented canned juice.
2934000	2936000	Canned juice?
2936000	2938000	No, it's not canned juice.
2938000	2940000	It's a very obvious thing.
2940000	2941000	Yeah.
2941000	2947000	Doesn't it suck that every joke is this kite that we fly now
2947000	2951000	and it has to have this tail on it to keep it from crashing into...
2951000	2952000	Oh, God.
2952000	2953000	Well, in full disclosure, because of what I just said,
2953000	2955000	I did not hear the word kite.
2957000	2959000	You heard kite because you hate the Jews.
2961000	2962000	Did she just say that?
2962000	2964000	Wasn't that the dot you were connecting?
2964000	2965000	Yeah.
2965000	2966000	Yeah.
2966000	2967000	I'm sorry.
2967000	2968000	I'm one step behind.
2968000	2970000	Anyways, but fuck that.
2970000	2971000	Who cares?
2971000	2972000	The only worst thing is fucking talking about it.
2972000	2973000	Let's just...
2973000	2976000	Let's just neo-fascist movement fucking eat itself.
2976000	2980000	I will be silently watching in the corner with a big bag of popcorn
2980000	2983000	because I can make jokes about kittens, man.
2983000	2984000	Sorry.
2984000	2985000	Let's hear one.
2985000	2986000	No.
2986000	2990000	When you told me that horse story, it made me flashback, too.
2990000	2992000	When you told me once when you were a kid,
2992000	2994000	you were like this obnoxious kid,
2994000	2996000	and one of the things you did was you were like,
2996000	2998000	how old were you?
2998000	3001000	And you did the exact same thing that this woman did of the story
3001000	3003000	except you were a kid.
3003000	3005000	You went to this horse riding thing,
3005000	3009000	but you were just this sweet little girl and told them,
3009000	3011000	I ride horses all the time.
3011000	3012000	Total lie.
3012000	3013000	Yeah.
3013000	3018000	It was when my family lived overseas and we were exploring around England
3018000	3021000	and I went to this thing and I told them that I had a bunch of horse riding experience.
3021000	3023000	Because you wanted the fastest horse
3023000	3026000	or you thought you were going to get a shitty horse if you told them you weren't.
3026000	3028000	I feel like other people can relate to this.
3028000	3030000	Maybe not just exclusively women,
3030000	3033000	but it feels like with horses like, oh, I know.
3033000	3034000	You know what I mean?
3034000	3036000	It doesn't seem like if you haven't ridden a horse,
3036000	3039000	it feels like, well, we'll just get each other.
3039000	3042000	And then you just got on the horse.
3042000	3045000	It sounds like a Fairly Brothers movie.
3045000	3049000	You got on the horse and just fucking, yeah!
3049000	3050000	And the horse did.
3050000	3051000	Yeah.
3051000	3053000	Everybody was in a line,
3053000	3056000	but I had talked about how great I was at riding horses
3056000	3059000	and this nice teacher wanted to empower me, I guess,
3059000	3062000	and everybody was strapped with rope to rope to rope.
3062000	3064000	And I had never ridden a horse.
3064000	3066000	And I was like, this is my chance.
3066000	3069000	And I did what I had seen in the movies.
3069000	3072000	And we took off down the mountainside
3072000	3076000	and the instructor had to go after me because immediately I was like,
3076000	3077000	ah!
3077000	3080000	I clearly had never.
3080000	3082000	When you see it in the movies,
3082000	3084000	National Velvet was my favorite movie as a kid
3084000	3088000	and I just figured, oh, I'll just bear down and I'll be fine.
3089000	3092000	I love that all your childhood stories
3092000	3094000	are stories about you just like...
3094000	3095000	Being the worst.
3095000	3098000	...leaping and then maybe glancing
3098000	3100000	where you've left.
3100000	3102000	You're just kind of like, I'm going to do this.
3102000	3104000	And then you're like, ah!
3104000	3107000	Erin, was Blondie you?
3107000	3109000	She was the shadow you cast.
3109000	3110000	No.
3110000	3115000	I do like her confidence was pretty amazing.
3115000	3119000	I think she was very petite and looked very young for her age.
3119000	3123000	And I wonder if maybe because people usually see her as a young woman.
3123000	3125000	And condescend to her.
3125000	3128000	She needs to approach situations that way.
3128000	3130000	She's probably gotten way more,
3130000	3132000	especially someone who lives in America
3132000	3134000	and makes, what did you call it?
3134000	3136000	Fashion eyewear.
3136000	3137000	Luxury eyewear.
3137000	3140000	Somebody whose job does not usually involve
3140000	3144000	like hand-to-hand combat.
3144000	3148000	I bet she's gotten way more positive results
3148000	3151000	about the ratio of positive results to negative results
3151000	3156000	for false kind of forced assertiveness is higher.
3156000	3160000	It seemed like bad behavior from someone who's not necessarily a bad person
3160000	3163000	because I interacted with her later and she was totally cool.
3163000	3166000	It was just like, I don't know, just really shitty behavior.
3166000	3169000	But it is like a parable because it's like, it doesn't...
3169000	3173000	I mean, the people that get fucked over...
3173000	3175000	I mean, I guess it happens on the freeway every day.
3175000	3176000	It's like, I don't know.
3176000	3179000	It's just like, you see that like weird look on people's faces
3179000	3181000	when they do shitty things in traffic and they're kind of like,
3181000	3185000	you just, you project all this information onto them.
3185000	3188000	Oh my God, Kevin was saying the same thing.
3188000	3194000	About galaxies.
3194000	3199000	But the biggest nightmare of all is that when the person's like not even mad,
3199000	3202000	you kind of want people to be malicious more than you want
3202000	3204000	and that so often seems to be the reality,
3204000	3209000	which is that they're not thinking about other people.
3209000	3213000	They're just like these mannequins that are like driving a car
3213000	3218000	and they just like, I have something to do and they'd be so shocked if you...
3218000	3221000	And then other people who are like having a bad day,
3221000	3224000	they intersect with this behavior and then they're fucking...
3224000	3229000	Now that person's mad and they go like, what the fuck are you doing?
3229000	3231000	I'm like, what the fuck?
3231000	3233000	You just pulled out into...
3233000	3235000	I saw you, you're the look on your face.
3235000	3238000	You're like a fucking turtle behind a wheel.
3238000	3242000	You're just looking for a fly but you're in a world full of people
3242000	3244000	with three ton automobiles.
3244000	3249000	There are pregnant people, babies, giraffes, everywhere.
3249000	3252000	I went too far.
3252000	3256000	But then those people, if you've ever actually gotten mad enough to honk
3256000	3259000	and then make eye contact with them and flip them off,
3259000	3263000	kind of vent your outrage at their carelessness,
3263000	3266000	more often than not they're like...
3266000	3270000	They have this look on their face that's like, say moi?
3270000	3278000	They're just kind of like, me? My day? Today?
3278000	3280000	Someone gets mad at me? What did I do?
3280000	3282000	Well, or there was a mistake.
3283000	3285000	It's always a mistake.
3285000	3286000	They didn't mean to...
3286000	3289000	I mean, except for maybe like a weird Teregino character.
3289000	3291000	Nobody's like going out there.
3291000	3294000	I'm going to go ram into people or almost cause car accidents.
3294000	3301000	But they're not angry at people. Whatever.
3301000	3304000	What I'm saying is, I think that's more terrifying.
3304000	3308000	Because why weren't you thinking about other people?
3309000	3316000	I mean, I can understand not seeing that the light turned green or something.
3316000	3320000	I don't know. You get lost in thought and people behind you honk
3320000	3322000	and that's irritating. We've all been there.
3322000	3324000	Behind that person, we've all been there.
3324000	3326000	I bought a student driver magnet.
3326000	3330000	But I'm talking about not looking, not driving.
3330000	3332000	I've officially become middle aged.
3332000	3335000	Listen to my podcast. I will bitch about young people driving.
3336000	3337000	Can I add a correction?
3337000	3341000	I listened to the last week's episode, which was really fun.
3341000	3343000	In the episode, you were talking about baby names.
3343000	3346000	And you asked Dan what baby names I wanted.
3346000	3350000	Dan named two names that he suggested that I hate.
3352000	3354000	Connor and...
3354000	3355000	Cormac?
3355000	3357000	Cormac. Those are two names that Dan literally was like,
3357000	3359000	What about Cormac? What about Connor?
3359000	3361000	I don't remember that. I'm very sorry.
3361000	3363000	But you like Paloma.
3364000	3365000	I do like Paloma.
3365000	3366000	Yeah.
3366000	3367000	Maxwell.
3367000	3368000	Maxwell? Nope.
3369000	3371000	Is your name Maxwell?
3371000	3372000	No, it was from the podcast.
3372000	3373000	Oh.
3373000	3375000	From your former D&D character or whatever.
3375000	3376000	Oh, yeah.
3376000	3378000	I do like the name.
3378000	3381000	My D&D character, Maxwell Artfall.
3384000	3386000	Or was that my Shadowrun character?
3386000	3388000	I can't remember.
3388000	3390000	What was Night moves?
3390000	3391000	Nightblade.
3391000	3392000	Night moves?
3392000	3393000	Night moves?
3396000	3399000	That's what Dan said to the ladies when he was...
3399000	3403000	Oh, one more thing and then we'll bring Spencer up.
3405000	3407000	You were telling me a story from camp.
3407000	3410000	And then you started crying while you were telling the story
3410000	3412000	and telling the story.
3412000	3415000	And I was telling a story at the Memorial Day barbecue
3415000	3417000	where I couldn't...
3417000	3418000	I could not...
3418000	3420000	And I don't think it was that drunk.
3420000	3422000	I'm sure there was some chemical involved.
3422000	3425000	I'm sure I had enough liquor in me that maybe if I was dead sober
3425000	3426000	this wouldn't happen.
3426000	3430000	But I could not tell this story without crying.
3430000	3431000	I was trying.
3431000	3433000	I was talking to two guys.
3433000	3436000	Chris McKenna and Tom Kaufman, I think.
3436000	3440000	I was very incentivized to not fucking be crying
3440000	3442000	while I was telling this dumb story.
3442000	3444000	And I couldn't get through the story.
3444000	3446000	And then that was happening to you at dinner tonight.
3446000	3448000	Or actually, well, it was happening because you were telling
3448000	3449000	about how it happened to you at camp.
3449000	3451000	What was the story that you...
3451000	3456000	It was about the swings in Montreal.
3456000	3460000	In Montreal, there's this artist that put up these swings
3460000	3462000	in the middle of a central area.
3462000	3464000	And they're lit at the bottom.
3464000	3468000	And when you swing on them, they play music.
3468000	3470000	And when the artist installed this piece,
3470000	3473000	he was just thinking it would be this beautiful thing from far away.
3473000	3474000	You see lights swinging back and forth,
3474000	3478000	kind of like the light posts outside of LACMA.
3479000	3481000	But the...
3481000	3482000	I wonder if I'll cry again.
3482000	3483000	I'll just...
3483000	3484000	That's what I wanted.
3484000	3487000	So there are all these swings.
3487000	3489000	And there are like 50 different swings.
3489000	3496000	What he didn't anticipate was that people on the swings
3496000	3499000	started interacting with strangers
3499000	3503000	and started working together to make music on the swings.
3503000	3505000	Because they all made different...
3505000	3506000	They all make different songs.
3506000	3509000	So they would say, no, you go this way, you go that way.
3509000	3512000	And there was a picture of a man and his daughters
3512000	3515000	and he's holding the swings and they're all moving together.
3515000	3518000	And this woman was explaining this as part of her presentation
3518000	3521000	and I was just weeping and then I cried at dinner.
3521000	3523000	And I guess I'm all out.
3523000	3525000	But yeah, so it was just very...
3525000	3527000	I was curious.
3527000	3529000	Are those things like sponges?
3529000	3530000	Can you squeeze them?
3530000	3532000	Do you have three times to tell that story?
3532000	3534000	When we were on the road, that guy told me the story
3534000	3536000	about his fiancé.
3536000	3538000	And I had found that when I was telling the story,
3538000	3541000	I couldn't do it without crying backstage.
3541000	3544000	And so that night on the road,
3544000	3547000	I can't remember what city we were in, but I tried it.
3547000	3549000	And again, I think I cried on stage, right?
3549000	3550000	Because it was like...
3550000	3554000	And then at the Memorial Day barbecue,
3554000	3558000	I started recounting how we went to NASCAR
3558000	3561000	because we got invited there.
3561000	3562000	It was the year I got fired.
3562000	3563000	It was right before we got fired.
3563000	3566000	The head of Sony is like a NASCAR enthusiast.
3566000	3567000	They sponsor a car.
3567000	3569000	Sony sponsors a car maybe.
3569000	3573000	And we went to this NASCAR thing in Tacoma.
3573000	3574000	It's a subway thing, right?
3574000	3575000	Whatever.
3575000	3577000	And this woman that came to meet us,
3577000	3582000	who was like the head of Sony's assistant,
3582000	3588000	she sounded like...
3588000	3590000	Glorious Dynam.
3591000	3594000	Jeanette from the Ghostbusters secretary.
3594000	3595000	Annie Potts character.
3595000	3596000	Jeanine.
3596000	3597000	Jeanine.
3597000	3599000	Which is how I imagine Glorious Dynam.
3599000	3600000	She had that...
3600000	3606000	She was like that archetypically Jersey.
3606000	3609000	And she was like three and a half feet tall.
3609000	3610000	And she had...
3610000	3613000	I remember I was having horn rimmed glasses with chains
3613000	3618000	and was very tired in a very urban chic way.
3618000	3621000	She greeted us at the arena and was like,
3621000	3624000	you are going to love NASCAR.
3624000	3626000	It's a delight.
3626000	3628000	The drivers are so amazing.
3628000	3629000	It's a great experience.
3629000	3631000	People just love it.
3631000	3633000	It was such a weird...
3633000	3635000	It was not a NASCAR personality.
3635000	3636000	Erin and I kept...
3636000	3638000	She was very intellectual too.
3638000	3640000	She was very smart and thoughtful.
3640000	3641000	We kept falling back and going,
3641000	3643000	is she forced to do this?
3643000	3645000	Because she shouldn't be forced to do this.
3645000	3647000	Because if you haven't been to NASCAR,
3647000	3649000	it's all very white.
3649000	3650000	It's all very Christian.
3650000	3652000	God is a big part of all of it.
3652000	3653000	There's constant praying.
3653000	3658000	It doesn't seem like a place where a nice Jewish woman
3658000	3659000	would want to hang out.
3659000	3660000	That's her backstory.
3660000	3661000	She's very nice.
3661000	3662000	She shows us where the sandwiches are.
3662000	3664000	She introduces us to the driver of the car.
3664000	3669000	Everything is very heartland, wasp-y.
3669000	3671000	Is it in California here?
3671000	3672000	Yeah.
3672000	3674000	So the Pomona Speedway probably, right?
3674000	3675000	Fontana, right?
3675000	3676000	Fontana, yeah.
3676000	3677000	Yeah.
3677000	3680000	So at a certain point, I go,
3680000	3681000	I'm going to broach it.
3681000	3682000	I'm going to go,
3682000	3684000	so whatever her name was,
3684000	3686000	how does...
3686000	3687000	In that space she goes,
3687000	3690000	how does a New Jersey Jewish girl end up being a blah, blah, blah?
3690000	3694000	She summed up the whole thing.
3694000	3697000	So it took the whole burden of it off of her.
3697000	3700000	We're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3700000	3703000	What is this action figure doing in this playset?
3704000	3707000	And she goes, well, you know,
3707000	3708000	and she starts to...
3708000	3710000	She recounts the story.
3710000	3711000	It has a real answer.
3711000	3714000	And the answer is that when she was a kid,
3714000	3715000	her dad...
3715000	3717000	Are you going to cry?
3717000	3719000	Cry, cry, cry.
3719000	3721000	Her dad was really into cars,
3721000	3724000	and she would sit with him and fix cars with him,
3724000	3725000	and then he died,
3725000	3727000	and then she explained that.
3727000	3728000	It was fucking amazing.
3728000	3730000	And I can't say it without crying,
3730000	3731000	because it's...
3731000	3732000	I don't know.
3732000	3735000	The stories like that aren't sponges that you can ring out,
3735000	3737000	like you can say three times and all the tears are gone.
3737000	3739000	There are certain stories that you might get better at telling
3739000	3742000	and eliminate the parts that are potent.
3742000	3745000	Yeah, I could maybe steer around that with my jet ski,
3745000	3748000	like set waypoints, Grand Theft Auto waypoints
3748000	3752000	that I know will avoid combat with my emotions.
3752000	3755000	But it's weirder to me that there's like a point in there
3755000	3758000	where it's an uncontrollable emotional response
3758000	3759000	to something that's...
3759000	3760000	It's not random,
3760000	3762000	because there's an emotional component to that story.
3762000	3763000	A father died and all this stuff,
3763000	3765000	but something is happening to me,
3765000	3766000	because Aaron said...
3766000	3767000	Someone said,
3767000	3769000	told me you're telling this story,
3769000	3770000	you couldn't stop crying,
3770000	3774000	and I thought we agreed that story was funny.
3774000	3775000	It was just kind of a funny thing.
3775000	3776000	I think he's not like the worst.
3776000	3777000	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
3777000	3778000	I don't know.
3778000	3779000	We both agreed it was touching,
3779000	3781000	but you were surprised,
3781000	3783000	because it wasn't like we were bawling that day.
3783000	3785000	Yeah, at the time it was kind of a...
3785000	3786000	Not laughing at her in any way,
3786000	3788000	but laughing at a like,
3788000	3792000	oh, this is such a seemingly really touching,
3792000	3795000	obvious, on the nose story.
3795000	3796000	For me,
3796000	3799000	father and son, mother and daughter stories and movies,
3799000	3800000	those always get me.
3800000	3801000	Frozen's a good movie.
3801000	3803000	It's not a great Disney movie.
3803000	3805000	I'm a sucker for Disney films.
3805000	3807000	Frozen, it's not great.
3807000	3809000	But still, there's moments in it
3809000	3811000	where sisters or family stuff,
3811000	3812000	I'll just start crying.
3812000	3814000	I'm a pushover for that kind of shit.
3814000	3815000	You gotta let it go, Jeff.
3815000	3817000	Let it go, let it go.
3817000	3818000	I'm scared to watch them.
3818000	3821000	The young male friendships get me,
3821000	3823000	Sandlot and Stand By Me,
3823000	3826000	like little boys that are friends.
3826000	3827000	I just gotta...
3827000	3829000	I just want to watch those.
3829000	3830000	I just want to watch them.
3830000	3833000	I'm going to get you a white van for Christmas.
3835000	3836000	I want you to live your...
3836000	3840000	Can you get me a big baseball met decal for the side?
3840000	3842000	With free beneath it?
3842000	3844000	I don't know.
3844000	3846000	I want to attract the right kind of boys.
3847000	3849000	Someone said, like, baseball.
3849000	3851000	There are certain scenes in certain movies
3851000	3853000	that are absolutely meaningless to other people.
3853000	3854000	If I describe a certain scene,
3854000	3855000	I will start crying,
3855000	3857000	and I've done it a million times.
3857000	3859000	There are certain things that affect you.
3859000	3860000	Well, I'm a crier.
3860000	3861000	I think we've discussed it.
3861000	3863000	I mean, you could fake cry on cue.
3863000	3865000	People couldn't tell a difference, so...
3865000	3866000	I can't fake cry on cue.
3866000	3868000	I can't just produce a tear
3868000	3870000	without actually going through something.
3870000	3872000	But I can cry on camera.
3872000	3873000	Right.
3873000	3874000	It's embarrassing,
3874000	3876000	because one time I did a pilot...
3876000	3877000	Pumblebag.
3877000	3878000	I did a pilot.
3878000	3879000	Oh, dear.
3879000	3880000	I did a pilot, and it was two doctors,
3880000	3881000	and I cried on scene,
3881000	3882000	and the director walked up and he goes,
3882000	3884000	okay, Jeff, that's a little bit much.
3886000	3887000	I was like, all right.
3887000	3889000	I didn't have to cry on that scene, did I?
3889000	3891000	He didn't say any cries.
3891000	3893000	I just started crying and just saying...
3893000	3897000	That little boy doesn't retrain his brain.
3897000	3900000	He'll be dyslexic until sixth grade.
3900000	3901000	No, maybe...
3901000	3903000	It was like...
3903000	3905000	What time is it again?
3905000	3907000	It was meeting the scene.
3907000	3909000	I just thought I'd really get an Emmy
3909000	3910000	in that pilot that never aired.
3910000	3912000	When I was in the fifth grade,
3912000	3913000	I was in a Christmas play,
3913000	3915000	and at a certain point,
3915000	3918000	the chorus came out with these big plastic lollipops,
3918000	3920000	and we were supposed to be dancing with the lollipops,
3920000	3922000	and in rehearsal, the director had said,
3922000	3925000	like, pretend like you really want to lick the lollipop.
3925000	3927000	And I misunderstood.
3927000	3929000	So in the play, when everyone came out
3929000	3931000	and everyone's dancing with the lollipops and going...
3931000	3933000	Like, for the podcast listeners,
3933000	3936000	just gently, like, away-air licking the lollipop.
3936000	3940000	I was licking and pretending to eat the lollipop,
3940000	3942000	and I forgot to dance, was just standing there,
3942000	3944000	like I was eating.
3944000	3945000	Just...
3945000	3947000	Just...
3951000	3956000	And to get notes after a one-time production.
3956000	3959000	Yeah, they're just worried you're going out into the world.
3960000	3962000	They're not even worried about next week's show.
3962000	3963000	The show is closed.
3963000	3965000	Here's the personality notes.
3965000	3968000	Erin McGathey, the world is full of scissors,
3968000	3973000	so we need to talk to you about your behavior on stage tonight.
3973000	3974000	Yeah, I can't...
3974000	3979000	I can't watch that Michael Keaton's My Life...
3979000	3980000	Fucking...
3980000	3983000	When the dad starts shaving them, look it up.
3983000	3986000	When the dad starts shaving them.
3986000	3988000	Michael Keaton in My Life plays a terminally ill...
3988000	3989000	Oh, TMS.
3989000	3992000	...man who is... Nicole Kidman is pregnant,
3992000	3995000	and he's taping his life...
3995000	3996000	He's taping...
3996000	3997000	He's taping...
3997000	4000000	He's making tapes that his kid can watch.
4000000	4001000	This doesn't affect me at all.
4001000	4003000	I can roll my eyes describing this.
4003000	4006000	Michael Keaton's making tapes because he's going to die
4006000	4010000	so that his kid can watch Michael Keaton after he's dead.
4010000	4014000	You know, I mean, don't flatter yourself, Dad.
4014000	4015000	But it's...
4015000	4016000	Hard work.
4017000	4019000	But Michael Keaton's dad is like...
4019000	4020000	I don't know.
4020000	4024000	Something pheromonal must come off the screen
4024000	4026000	or something in his relationship with his dad.
4026000	4028000	It's just a lack of a relationship.
4028000	4030000	And then he's not even telling his family
4030000	4032000	he has cancer for a while,
4032000	4034000	and then there's a point where Michael Keaton's too sick
4034000	4035000	to get out of bed,
4035000	4037000	and his dad is shaving him with a straight razor.
4037000	4039000	It's fucked up.
4040000	4042000	His dad shaves him.
4043000	4044000	Oh...
4045000	4046000	It was fucked up.
4046000	4048000	I also once cried at the end of Doc Hollywood,
4048000	4049000	so you go...
4050000	4051000	You figure it out.
4051000	4052000	That was just drunk.
4052000	4054000	That was just fucking drunk.
4054000	4057000	I went on a date with a girl...
4057000	4060000	What year did Pretty Woman come out? Anybody?
4060000	4061000	Ninety.
4061000	4062000	Ninety?
4062000	4065000	I went on a date with this girl to Pretty Woman,
4065000	4067000	and I cried.
4067000	4068000	Cried.
4068000	4069000	I think she should have.
4069000	4071000	She cried too.
4071000	4073000	But I was crying harder.
4075000	4077000	Because you feel like a little hooker.
4082000	4084000	You want to...
4084000	4086000	I haven't seen the movie.
4086000	4088000	You go back into that warehouse.
4088000	4089000	I had a no kissing role,
4089000	4091000	but I found out that you have to break that rule sometime.
4091000	4092000	I haven't seen it.
4092000	4093000	Wait, you are.
4093000	4094000	Oh, Billy Elliot.
4094000	4095000	You haven't seen it?
4095000	4096000	The film Billy Elliot.
4096000	4097000	I also haven't seen Billy Elliot.
4097000	4098000	Little boys.
4098000	4099000	I saw that with a friend.
4100000	4101000	It wasn't a girl I was dating with.
4101000	4103000	It was a friend of mine.
4103000	4105000	And we went to the Los Feliz 3, a little tiny theater,
4105000	4106000	and we saw it.
4106000	4108000	And I was sitting there, and I'm watching it.
4108000	4113000	And it's about a little kid who wants to dance,
4113000	4116000	and his family is poor, like working class English family.
4116000	4119000	And the mother dies.
4119000	4122000	Father sacrifices everything to get this kid through dance school.
4122000	4125000	And at the end, he comes on stage, and he just swan like.
4125000	4126000	Oh, okay.
4126000	4128000	When he jumps in the air...
4128000	4131000	Spoilers, everybody, if you haven't seen Billy Elliot.
4131000	4132000	30 years ago.
4132000	4134000	He comes out, and he's an adult.
4134000	4136000	What they don't do in that movie is make a big thing about him
4136000	4137000	possibly being gay.
4137000	4139000	They don't make a big thing about,
4139000	4140000	well, you're a gay son.
4140000	4141000	They don't do that.
4141000	4143000	Like, you want to dance, and I'm a coal miner,
4143000	4145000	or whatever he's mining.
4145000	4147000	I can't afford your lifestyle.
4147000	4148000	I can't send you to classes.
4148000	4149000	I can't do that.
4149000	4150000	So they do that.
4150000	4153000	And that's Father's Sonship that's amazing.
4153000	4155000	And then at the end, when now he's an adult,
4155000	4156000	and they cut to all of a sudden,
4156000	4158000	he's this huge, fit, sexy, older...
4158000	4160000	Or not older, he's probably 18, 19.
4160000	4164000	And he's like the swan and swan.
4164000	4167000	And he comes out and does his leap.
4167000	4168000	And I may cry when I say this.
4168000	4170000	I've told it too many times, Dan.
4170000	4173000	And they cut to the father, and he goes...
4173000	4175000	And he sees his son leap in the air,
4175000	4177000	and he's like overwhelmed by it.
4177000	4180000	And that to me, I cried so fucking hard in that theater.
4180000	4181000	We got in the car.
4181000	4183000	I live, at the time, like six blocks away from that theater.
4183000	4185000	I had to pull over.
4185000	4186000	Because I was driving.
4186000	4188000	You were watching in your car?
4188000	4189000	No.
4189000	4190000	I cried in the theater.
4190000	4191000	And you were still crying?
4191000	4193000	I was embarrassed.
4193000	4195000	I was not embarrassed about crying.
4195000	4199000	I was afraid of affecting other people's movie-going experience
4199000	4202000	because I was sobbing.
4202000	4204000	And so I was trying to muffle.
4204000	4205000	I broke down.
4205000	4210000	And then we made it to the car, and I got my shit together.
4210000	4212000	We were the last people to leave the theater.
4212000	4214000	And we got in the car, and I drove home.
4214000	4216000	And I had to pull over because I couldn't see the road
4216000	4217000	because I was crying so hard.
4217000	4219000	And I had to stop three blocks away,
4219000	4221000	and I was still just completely overcome by that.
4221000	4222000	Jeez.
4222000	4223000	Yeah.
4223000	4225000	Get a life, this guy.
4225000	4226000	You know what fucked me up?
4226000	4227000	Yeah.
4227000	4230000	Yeah, it's no Doc Hollywood.
4230000	4234000	I got all fucked up by the Lego movie.
4234000	4235000	Really?
4235000	4236000	Did you see me?
4236000	4238000	Did you know I was crying next to you?
4238000	4239000	I did not know you were crying.
4239000	4241000	And usually, I'm always watching the TV.
4241000	4243000	That was a hard one because it was right on the fucking bubble
4243000	4247000	of what's allowed to make you cry versus what's, like,
4247000	4249000	just forcing it and, like, hoping you cry,
4249000	4251000	which I don't want to give a fucking satisfaction on.
4251000	4253000	It's a kind of Lego movie.
4253000	4257000	It's literally about corporate plastic.
4257000	4259000	And I was like, I know you want me to cry.
4259000	4260000	It's a fine-written movie.
4260000	4262000	You did a good job.
4262000	4264000	But it's not cry for me.
4264000	4268000	It's musical crescendos when a simple story beat happens
4268000	4269000	and the music swells.
4269000	4270000	I'm fucking on.
4270000	4271000	Game over, baby.
4271000	4273000	I think it had a lot to do with Will Ferrell.
4273000	4277000	I think he's a really, like, stranger than fiction.
4277000	4279000	Like, if he wants to, he can.
4279000	4281000	I think that's why he's so funny.
4281000	4283000	I think he's a really facile.
4283000	4285000	Did you cry during Meet the Robinsons?
4285000	4286000	Did anyone?
4286000	4287000	Underrated movie.
4287000	4289000	Anyone like Meet the Robinsons?
4289000	4290000	I never saw.
4290000	4293000	Wait, what was Meet the Robinsons?
4293000	4294000	Yeah, that's good.
4294000	4296000	How about Fox and the Hound?
4296000	4299000	Fox and the Hound is my ultimate.
4300000	4302000	There's still little boys, but they're animals.
4302000	4303000	Wait, what's Meet the Robinsons?
4303000	4305000	What is that?
4305000	4306000	I don't know.
4306000	4307000	What's Meet the Robinsons?
4307000	4308000	There's somebody Meet the...
4308000	4311000	Meet the Robinsons is about the young orphan
4311000	4312000	who's an inventor.
4312000	4313000	And he finds a family.
4313000	4314000	I haven't seen it.
4314000	4318000	I was watching the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn.
4318000	4320000	And it starts off, and I've...
4320000	4321000	Who's it?
4321000	4323000	Is it William Holden in Boca?
4323000	4324000	Who's in it?
4324000	4326000	Nobody knows, right?
4326000	4328000	It starts off like these rich people partying,
4328000	4330000	and they pan outside the party,
4330000	4332000	and they go up this tree,
4332000	4335000	and there is this chauffeur's daughter
4335000	4338000	from this rich family, this rich New York family.
4338000	4341000	She's just in the tree watching these sexy rich people party.
4341000	4342000	Fuck that movie.
4342000	4344000	And they go up the tree,
4344000	4346000	and they just cut to Audrey Hepburn's face,
4346000	4348000	and I was watching it at home alone,
4348000	4351000	and I just hit pause and broke down crying.
4351000	4352000	Really?
4352000	4353000	It's such a beautiful story,
4353000	4357000	but Audrey Hepburn is too beautiful in that movie.
4357000	4364000	I think you lose the impact of that story so lost on her beautiful little star face.
4364000	4366000	I'm not defending the film or the plot or anything.
4366000	4368000	I'm just saying that when they cut up there,
4368000	4369000	and you see her looking at that,
4369000	4371000	and it was that moment so well-directed of somebody
4371000	4373000	being on the outside of something,
4373000	4376000	and you cut to her eyes, and she's so beautiful,
4376000	4378000	and she's so unique.
4378000	4381000	It's one of those moments where I had to hit pause,
4381000	4383000	and I just came apart.
4383000	4386000	But I do that a lot, so that's not what I'm saying a whole lot.
4386000	4389000	Are you saying you were just crying at her beauty?
4389000	4391000	No, not her physical beauty.
4391000	4392000	There was just that moment.
4392000	4393000	How are you not weeping right now?
4393000	4394000	There's moments like...
4394000	4396000	Catherine Hepburn, what's the fucking movie?
4396000	4397000	Holiday or some shit?
4397000	4398000	Was it her and...?
4398000	4399000	Holiday?
4399000	4400000	No, not Robin Holiday.
4400000	4403000	This one, it's her and...
4403000	4405000	What's the one with Cary Grant?
4405000	4406000	Fuck, now I can't think of who it is.
4406000	4408000	It's called Fright Niddles.
4408000	4412000	He's kind of like a socialist anarchist.
4412000	4414000	He should marry the rich heiress,
4414000	4416000	but he wants to go away and do his own thing
4416000	4418000	and not become a capitalist.
4418000	4419000	That's deep.
4419000	4420000	Uh-huh.
4420000	4424000	At any point, Catherine Hepburn...
4424000	4427000	Catherine Hepburn turns into...
4427000	4431000	She's the not-sexy sister,
4431000	4433000	although Catherine Hepburn's gorgeous.
4433000	4437000	And the guy leaves, and the door opens,
4437000	4439000	and she sees him, and she turns to the camera,
4439000	4440000	and Catherine Hepburn has the ability
4440000	4442000	to always look like she's about to cry
4442000	4443000	or say something amazing.
4443000	4445000	And she just turns to camera.
4445000	4449000	It's one of those moments where somebody tweet me
4449000	4451000	or put it on some sort of forum
4451000	4452000	and tell me all the details about that.
4452000	4454000	There's a moment where cinema,
4454000	4456000	like the director, the actors, the script,
4456000	4459000	all comes together, and somebody just turning the camera
4459000	4461000	and the way it's lit and the way it's shot,
4461000	4463000	they can just hit you like a fucking lightning bolt.
4463000	4466000	And that's my favorite stuff in the world.
4466000	4470000	That's what happened in Doc Hollywood.
4470000	4472000	You gotta watch it.
4472000	4475000	You know who I always call Doc Hollywood.
4475000	4477000	Glory gets me, too.
4477000	4478000	I, uh...
4478000	4479000	Glory just...
4481000	4483000	Yeah, Glory had a shelf life for getting away.
4483000	4485000	I think Glory got me in high school,
4485000	4486000	and then I started to go like,
4486000	4489000	fuck, these poor people are all just dying for rich people.
4489000	4490000	I don't even...
4490000	4492000	I'm just angry watching it.
4492000	4494000	But monuments, man, I started crying
4494000	4497000	because Hitler lost all his paintings.
4497000	4501000	I mean, I've been wanting to say that for 15 minutes.
4501000	4504000	I thought that was that funny.
4504000	4506000	But I'm also distracted.
4506000	4509000	Is this a friend of yours, this young lady?
4509000	4512000	Did she leave because the show was terrible, or did she...?
4512000	4514000	I'm so much more focused.
4514000	4517000	I feel bad about where she's sitting.
4517000	4520000	I don't think it's because your feet were in her face.
4520000	4521000	Oh, okay.
4521000	4524000	I'm sitting at a certain angle,
4524000	4526000	and I want to keep the volume at the same place
4526000	4528000	so the person I'm talking with doesn't know that it's happening.
4528000	4530000	But there's a fellow right there...
4530000	4531000	Shit, he woke up!
4531000	4532000	This guy over here.
4532000	4534000	Are you okay?
4534000	4535000	What's your name, man?
4535000	4536000	What's your name?
4538000	4539000	What's your name?
4539000	4540000	What's your name?
4540000	4541000	What's your name?
4541000	4542000	Colin.
4542000	4543000	Colin, you're right, man?
4543000	4544000	I'm sleeping.
4544000	4547000	Because I've been watching you struggle with this the whole show, man.
4547000	4549000	Like, you've been head in hands.
4549000	4550000	Are you high?
4550000	4551000	Are you a little tired?
4551000	4552000	What's going on over here?
4552000	4553000	A little bit of both?
4553000	4556000	Well, I just got back from a long trip.
4556000	4560000	Colin, I could be wrong, but have you ever fallen asleep at a UCB show?
4561000	4564000	I feel like I've seen you sleep before.
4565000	4567000	I thought you were being defensive.
4568000	4569000	No, don't worry.
4569000	4570000	We're not trained to improvise.
4570000	4571000	When I saw him, I was like,
4571000	4573000	that guy fell asleep at my show at UCB.
4573000	4575000	Colin, you went over there.
4577000	4578000	You're good, right?
4578000	4580000	Oh, see, a guy just brought you a water.
4580000	4581000	That's great.
4581000	4584000	That guy is podcast producer Dustin Marshow.
4584000	4587000	Colin, I'm just glad you're going to make it, man.
4587000	4590000	Where'd you fly in from, or where'd you travel from?
4590000	4591000	I drove back from Zion.
4591000	4592000	From Zion?
4592000	4593000	Oh, nice.
4593000	4594000	Where's Zion?
4594000	4595000	It's in Utah.
4595000	4596000	Oh, Utah.
4596000	4597000	You can't know where Zion is.
4597000	4599000	The robots will find it.
4603000	4606000	It's a little Matrix comedy, man.
4609000	4610000	Classic.
4610000	4612000	That's what we do here at Harmony Town.
4612000	4615000	We sneak into Matrix comedy once in a while.
4615000	4616000	Are you good, though, man?
4616000	4617000	Yeah.
4617000	4618000	Okay, good.
4618000	4621000	I thought you might have some serious shit going down.
4621000	4622000	He's just a little sleepy.
4622000	4623000	What a nightmare to be.
4623000	4625000	He stirred from your sleep.
4625000	4626000	He wasn't just sleepy.
4626000	4628000	He was wringing his face, and he was rubbing his head.
4628000	4631000	I mean, that's what I do when I'm going,
4631000	4632000	like, God, please don't fall asleep.
4632000	4637000	I know this show is just three people talking about movies they liked.
4638000	4640000	But it's so much like being in a car,
4640000	4643000	just going down the highway from Zion.
4643000	4645000	I don't know what's real anymore.
4645000	4648000	What was going down in Zion, Colin?
4648000	4650000	Oh, I was doing some canyoneering.
4650000	4653000	Did you do some canyoneering?
4653000	4656000	Okay, the shit got fucking more interesting, doesn't it?
4656000	4658000	What does it take to canyoneer?
4658000	4661000	I'm not familiar with the canyoneering lifestyle.
4661000	4662000	Yeah.
4662000	4663000	Get a...
4663000	4665000	Go sit at Spencer's table, Colin.
4665000	4666000	Get on the microphone.
4666000	4667000	No, no, come up to the...
4667000	4669000	Sit down over there so you can fall asleep, possibly.
4669000	4671000	Okay.
4672000	4675000	Colin, are you a canyoneer by trade?
4675000	4677000	Not by trade, no.
4677000	4678000	What would he sell?
4678000	4682000	I don't know what a canyoneer is.
4682000	4686000	Okay, so he might sell rope or arrowheads?
4686000	4688000	I don't know what he does.
4690000	4694000	Colin, we need four canyones today.
4694000	4696000	Just make a list.
4697000	4700000	These arrowheads are going out the door like hotcakes.
4700000	4703000	We need more canyoneering to happen.
4703000	4705000	The overhead's so tremendous.
4707000	4710000	Walk me through as an outsider.
4710000	4713000	So you know mountaineering, like climbing a mountain.
4713000	4716000	Well, this is canyoneering, so you go down.
4716000	4718000	So you descend into canyons.
4718000	4720000	You descend down into canyons.
4720000	4721000	It's a joke.
4721000	4723000	Why did you canyoneer?
4723000	4725000	Because it isn't there.
4726000	4729000	No, we canyoneering.
4729000	4732000	That's mountain climbing.
4732000	4734000	No, you have to climb up.
4734000	4737000	And then you descend down into a canyon through...
4737000	4739000	How do you know when you're finished?
4739000	4741000	So if a canyoneering is the opposite, you descend down,
4741000	4744000	then the hard work lay ahead where you have to climb the fuck out.
4744000	4747000	You don't have to climb out because you get to the bottom.
4747000	4750000	Isn't your car up there?
4751000	4755000	You just live down there for the rest of your life?
4756000	4760000	Okay, sometimes you can go from your car,
4760000	4763000	hike up, and then come back down to your car.
4763000	4765000	Or you set up a shuttle.
4765000	4767000	So when you get to the bottom...
4767000	4768000	Canyoneering has shuttles.
4768000	4770000	Someone will pick you up.
4770000	4773000	Sometimes it's a long walk back to your car.
4773000	4776000	What is your favorite part of canyoneering?
4776000	4779000	Clearly not the walk back to your car.
4780000	4783000	Do you like going down more?
4783000	4785000	Or going back up?
4785000	4788000	Oh, so you have to repel.
4788000	4791000	So you're going to share cliffs and shit?
4791000	4793000	We had to wear wetsuits.
4793000	4794000	What?
4794000	4796000	Yeah.
4796000	4798000	Why wetsuits?
4798000	4800000	Because we had to swim in these canyons.
4800000	4802000	Jesus.
4802000	4804000	You're like a navy seal.
4805000	4808000	So when you're repelling,
4808000	4811000	in the movies, the people,
4811000	4816000	are you driving metal into rock?
4816000	4819000	Okay, so that's like rock climbing.
4819000	4821000	They're setting anchors in here.
4821000	4823000	So you can tie something up at the top?
4823000	4824000	They're climbing up.
4824000	4826000	How do you anchor yourself into the top?
4826000	4829000	Well, we repelled off some rocks.
4829000	4831000	Just a pile of rocks?
4831000	4833000	So you just tie off on a big rock
4833000	4834000	and hope that that rock is...
4834000	4836000	And hope that Looney Tunes rules don't apply.
4836000	4841000	Sometimes you can use a nice big tree.
4841000	4843000	What do you prefer, a rock or a tree?
4843000	4845000	I set an anchor that was just a pile of rocks.
4845000	4848000	So you go down into a canyon.
4848000	4850000	Essentially, your shit is up top, right?
4850000	4854000	So yeah, you park your car at the...
4854000	4856000	I feel like he's annoyed with these questions.
4856000	4861000	The trailhead, you hike to the drop-in point
4861000	4864000	following some very vague directions.
4864000	4868000	Sometimes it's very difficult to find it, get lost.
4868000	4872000	And then you climb down into the canyon.
4872000	4874000	Once you're down there, how do you get...
4874000	4875000	Your rope is just tied up there?
4875000	4876000	It just stays there?
4876000	4877000	Do you have a way to get it back off?
4877000	4879000	Or do you do an Indiana Jones thing with a whip
4879000	4880000	where it just comes off?
4880000	4883000	So you throw one end of the rope down,
4883000	4887000	and then you block it off so it can't go any further.
4887000	4890000	You repel down, and then you have to have a rope
4890000	4892000	that's twice as long as the repel.
4892000	4893000	Right.
4893000	4895000	So you can throw the other end down,
4895000	4898000	and then when you all get down, you can pull that other end.
4898000	4899000	Oh.
4899000	4900000	I would do it wrong.
4900000	4902000	I would do it wrong because I didn't even get that.
4902000	4905000	So one of your friends has to not be a canyonary.
4905000	4907000	It has to be up at the car getting your rope back.
4907000	4908000	No, no, no.
4908000	4909000	Oh, when you're done, you get back up there
4909000	4910000	and you fucking pull it back up.
4910000	4911000	That's where the car is.
4911000	4915000	The car's by the tree, basically.
4915000	4916000	So when you get down to the canyon,
4916000	4918000	do you guys have a little party down there?
4918000	4920000	Do you guys set up camp and fucking make marshmallows
4920000	4921000	and shit?
4921000	4923000	Well, it depends.
4923000	4926000	Sometimes there's the canyons that are long enough
4926000	4930000	to facilitate a three-day trek through it.
4930000	4934000	What's a good canyon and what's a bad canyon?
4934000	4935000	What?
4935000	4936000	What?
4936000	4939000	Like when you're like, obviously...
4939000	4941000	He's not going to talk shit about a canyon.
4941000	4942000	He's a canyoneer.
4942000	4944000	Obviously, like...
4944000	4945000	He's making all the arrowhead money.
4945000	4948000	Obviously, some trips are better than others.
4948000	4952000	Like, what makes, like, oh, yeah, that was deep.
4952000	4954000	Or like, that was...
4957000	4959000	That was cavernous, man.
4959000	4962000	Straight up cavernous.
4962000	4964000	That was not convex at all.
4964000	4965000	It definitely depends.
4965000	4967000	It depends on what you're there for.
4967000	4968000	See, I like...
4968000	4969000	What are you there for?
4969000	4971000	I like the challenges of, like, some down climbing
4971000	4974000	and some of the problem solving that comes with setting anchors
4974000	4975000	and...
4975000	4977000	What's bad canyoneering form?
4977000	4980000	Like, were there any, like, faux pas?
4980000	4983000	Like, do you ever be going down into a canyon
4983000	4985000	and you see someone else going down the canyon
4985000	4986000	and you go, that guy's doing it wrong.
4986000	4990000	Well, yeah, there was a story, this group.
4990000	4991000	Well, it wasn't really a group.
4991000	4992000	It was two people.
4992000	4996000	It was this gentleman and his priest.
4996000	5000000	That's already the wrong way to canyoneer.
5000000	5002000	That seems pessimistic.
5005000	5007000	I got a bad feeling about this.
5007000	5009000	Father, will you join me?
5009000	5013000	He wanted to be baptized in this canyon or whatever.
5013000	5018000	So his poor priest is like, okay.
5018000	5021000	So I don't know what they were thinking,
5021000	5025000	but they went into the canyon with flip-flops,
5025000	5029000	like tank tops, like shorts,
5029000	5032000	and a backpack full of camera supplies.
5033000	5036000	No water, no food, no helmets,
5036000	5039000	and no rope or descending.
5039000	5041000	No rope?
5041000	5044000	They somehow managed to get their way down this canyon.
5044000	5046000	They were going to have to put buttscoot down the hill?
5046000	5047000	Yeah.
5047000	5051000	They somehow managed to get down this canyon
5051000	5053000	and they got stuck on the opposite side
5053000	5056000	of this pool of freezing water
5056000	5058000	and they couldn't get across.
5058000	5060000	Who told you that story?
5060000	5063000	The group I went with actually was in that canyon.
5063000	5066000	They were doing the canyon with all of their gear and whatnot,
5066000	5068000	and they came across these two people.
5068000	5070000	That's so nuts.
5070000	5072000	Not to digress too much,
5072000	5074000	but somebody was telling me,
5074000	5076000	did you watch the show,
5076000	5078000	it's a reality show called I Should Have Died
5078000	5080000	or I Survived or something like that?
5080000	5082000	Yeah, yeah, I've heard of it.
5082000	5084000	I shouldn't be alive.
5084000	5086000	I Should Have Died was too negative.
5086000	5088000	They workshopped it.
5088000	5089000	I should have died.
5089000	5091000	I don't want to live.
5091000	5093000	Somebody was telling me about the show
5093000	5096000	and they were telling me about this couple
5096000	5098000	that was like they should have died
5098000	5100000	because they kind of went off into the wilderness unprepared,
5100000	5102000	but the thing that was amazing to me
5102000	5104000	is that at a certain point in their story,
5104000	5107000	when things are really dire already,
5107000	5110000	they come across a corpse,
5110000	5113000	an undiscovered corpse of a guy
5113000	5116000	that had more equipment than they set out with,
5116000	5120000	a fucking Chester Copperpot to their goonies,
5120000	5124000	and it was like a fucking emaciated,
5124000	5127000	skeletal fucking dude by a river
5127000	5128000	that was like,
5128000	5130000	yep, I found water, not enough.
5130000	5134000	And the way they survived,
5134000	5136000	this is so fucking sad.
5136000	5137000	I don't know.
5137000	5138000	Are you going to cry again?
5138000	5141000	No, no, because it's sad about just reality.
5141000	5143000	It's a sad joke that God plays on all of us.
5143000	5146000	The way they survived is that the guy,
5146000	5148000	this corpse had a lighter in his equipment
5148000	5153000	and the guy just started setting forest fires
5153000	5158000	until finally they caused enough of a problem
5158000	5161000	in terms of climate,
5161000	5166000	in terms of global economics that vehicles showed up.
5166000	5167000	So the guy got lost.
5167000	5168000	They got lost.
5168000	5169000	I found a corpse.
5169000	5170000	Yeah.
5170000	5171000	The corpse had a lighter?
5171000	5172000	The corpse had a lighter and it worked.
5172000	5174000	And then he just started lighting forest fires.
5174000	5175000	Yeah.
5175000	5176000	Hey, Colin, would you do it?
5176000	5178000	What part of that story do you...
5178000	5179000	That's just...
5179000	5180000	He's just being incredulous.
5180000	5181000	Dan, how about this?
5181000	5182000	Let's bring Spencer out.
5182000	5183000	Colin, would you mind coming up on stage
5183000	5184000	and playing D&D with me?
5184000	5185000	Yeah, yeah, would you?
5185000	5186000	You know...
5186000	5187000	We have a real...
5187000	5188000	A real engineer.
5188000	5189000	Let's bring Spencer out.
5195000	5197000	You'll be great at, I assume,
5197000	5201000	because it's like simulated wilderness.
5202000	5205000	What's happening, you guys?
5205000	5206000	Hey!
5206000	5207000	Spencer.
5207000	5209000	Sorry, it took so long to get you out here, man.
5209000	5210000	It's cool.
5210000	5211000	We met a sleepy canyoneer.
5211000	5212000	Oh, I know.
5212000	5213000	I know.
5213000	5214000	I saw.
5214000	5216000	Just real, real quick.
5216000	5219000	Large musical movie swells make me cry too, Jim.
5219000	5220000	Oh, yeah.
5220000	5221000	Musical swells, man.
5221000	5222000	Yeah, yeah.
5222000	5223000	Just...
5223000	5224000	That's getting out of the way.
5224000	5226000	I don't think you said this, but I know Colin.
5226000	5227000	Oh.
5227000	5228000	I'm friends with him.
5228000	5229000	For real.
5229000	5230000	Oh, yeah.
5230000	5231000	Yeah, yeah.
5231000	5233000	I like Colin because you're fucking...
5233000	5234000	You're a coyote.
5234000	5239000	I'm being glib, but you're into life hacking and wilderness, kind of.
5239000	5241000	Not that you're a big camping guy, but...
5241000	5243000	Yeah, we definitely trade coyote notes.
5243000	5244000	Sure.
5245000	5247000	Spencer, there was a coyote...
5247000	5251000	Spencer, there was several coyotes up at the camp.
5251000	5252000	Yeah.
5252000	5253000	Oh, Spencer.
5253000	5254000	Spencer's been telling me...
5254000	5256000	Spencer drives me to work in the morning.
5256000	5259000	He's been telling me that since that podcast...
5259000	5264000	I don't know if he connected the dots, but since that podcast, you've told me that you've
5264000	5268000	been seeing more and more coyotes gathering around your apartment.
5268000	5273000	Like, you didn't put it that way, but I was like, I think they heard the podcast.
5273000	5275000	They want to throw down.
5275000	5279000	I wouldn't put it that way because it's not factually accurate.
5279000	5286000	Like, when I dropped Dan off at his house, I was driving home and just, like, you know,
5286000	5288000	a couple near his house, I saw a coyote there.
5288000	5289000	All right, nearby.
5289000	5292000	And then I see him all the time at Griffith Park because I drive by in the mornings.
5292000	5294000	Oh, yeah, it's not near your place at all.
5294000	5296000	Coyotes are finding you, though.
5296000	5298000	Yeah, yeah, we're hanging out and stuff.
5298000	5303000	Coyotes are marauding through my neighborhood in Los Feliz, and my neighbor, Paul Rust,
5303000	5305000	his cat got eaten not so long ago.
5305000	5306000	Yeah, it's sad.
5306000	5307000	I see those signs.
5307000	5312000	And he said when he walks his dog, he goes out...
5312000	5317000	If it's 2 a.m., and he'll open the door, and the sound of the leash jingling is the dinner
5317000	5320000	bell for coyotes, they know the sound of doors opening and leashes.
5320000	5324000	And so there'd be a big-ass pack, and you wake up in my neighborhood to the sound of
5324000	5327000	an animal being absolutely murdered and screaming.
5327000	5332000	And then people coming out and throwing wine bottles and, like, whatever's at hand and
5332000	5333000	throwing shit at coyotes.
5333000	5334000	Wait, this is in your apartment?
5334000	5335000	Yeah.
5335000	5336000	What?
5336000	5337000	You live in a fucking...
5337000	5338000	What?
5338000	5339000	Let's go.
5339000	5340000	Coyotes come down by the dozen...
5340000	5341000	No, not at the dozen.
5341000	5342000	I'll say, fuck it.
5342000	5343000	400...
5344000	5346000	We are the 400!
5347000	5349000	Jeff, Jeff looks 50 yards from us.
5349000	5350000	You'll see.
5350000	5351000	Yeah, no, no.
5351000	5353000	You'll see, like, one coyote, three more, five more.
5353000	5354000	What?
5354000	5356000	And they come down in packs, and they go down...
5356000	5357000	Come down from where?
5357000	5360000	Coming down from Griffith Park.
5360000	5361000	They cross...
5361000	5362000	They cross those fields of ballpark.
5362000	5365000	You can see them sometimes crossing, like, little caravans, and they go...
5365000	5367000	And they come because of the dinner bell?
5367000	5369000	They come down to eat cats, and they come down to eat dogs.
5369000	5372000	My cat goes outside, yeah.
5372000	5374000	A dog across the street at the house...
5374000	5377000	Maybe like about a month, a month and a half ago.
5377000	5378000	I heard...
5378000	5379000	I mean, I can't do an impression...
5379000	5381000	Aaron, do an impression of a dog getting eaten.
5381000	5382000	A dog being eaten?
5382000	5383000	Yes.
5383000	5384000	What kind of dog?
5384000	5386000	A small dog, high-pitched terror.
5386000	5387000	Okay.
5389000	5390000	Oh, those are the coyotes.
5395000	5396000	Now, I...
5396000	5397000	I just came.
5397000	5398000	I imagine that.
5398000	5399000	I imagine that, but...
5400000	5402000	Someone's jerking after that right now.
5402000	5405000	I imagine that, but ten times worse and louder, and then...
5405000	5406000	Okay.
5406000	5407000	People were...
5408000	5409000	I said imagine it.
5410000	5412000	But, like, no, it's fucking...
5412000	5415000	It's bloody murder out there, and the coyotes are getting real good at it.
5415000	5417000	Do you think they could get into my backyard?
5417000	5418000	And don't be a doomsayer.
5418000	5421000	Be a supportive, if enabling, friend.
5421000	5422000	Yes, yes.
5422000	5424000	I will say that absolutely they can get into your backyard.
5424000	5426000	But there's a lot of bushes around it.
5426000	5427000	I don't think so.
5428000	5430000	Our backyard is surrounded by houses.
5430000	5433000	See the bush in our backyard, you know, like, not from your front yard.
5433000	5434000	They come in through the back.
5434000	5435000	There's...
5435000	5436000	Just jump down that wall thing.
5436000	5437000	But that's a back...
5437000	5438000	They would jump all that distance?
5438000	5440000	Yeah, it's a seven-foot wall.
5440000	5442000	They probably can't get back up easily, but, yeah.
5442000	5443000	Well, that would serve them right.
5443000	5445000	I'd like to see that coyote.
5445000	5449000	It'd be worth him eating my cat, just to have him trapped in my backyard.
5450000	5453000	Dan and I had a racking problem, and we kept on catching the neighbors.
5454000	5456000	If you're in back, I got a friend you want to meet.
5458000	5459000	Now, I don't think...
5459000	5462000	You're backyard surrounded by other houses that have front gates and stuff, too,
5462000	5463000	so it's probably...
5463000	5464000	It would be difficult for them to get out.
5464000	5468000	I just see them cruising, like, patrolling from door to door,
5468000	5469000	and they go in and out.
5469000	5470000	They do, yeah.
5470000	5472000	They go check out, like, back gates and stuff.
5472000	5473000	Yeah.
5473000	5474000	They were...
5474000	5476000	I mean, one came tooling down fucking...
5476000	5478000	I thought he was just, like, a drunk coyote,
5478000	5481000	because he was just coming down avocado?
5481000	5482000	What's it?
5482000	5483000	Little doms?
5483000	5484000	We were eating outside of little doms.
5484000	5488000	And he's just down the middle of the road, like, fucking an REM video,
5488000	5489000	just like...
5490000	5491000	Everybody hurts.
5491000	5492000	Everybody hurts.
5492000	5493000	Okay.
5493000	5495000	It's the end of the world.
5495000	5498000	But we had Harvey, and he was a puppy, and it was like...
5498000	5500000	He was, like, just...
5501000	5502000	It's crazy.
5502000	5506000	There's a family of skunks once in a while that will just decide to take up shop
5506000	5508000	in front of my front door, and they're adorable,
5508000	5510000	because there's mom and pop and a couple kids,
5510000	5513000	and they'll just cruise up, and they'll just sit on my front door,
5513000	5516000	and there's a Mexican stand-up that happens.
5516000	5517000	They're not going anywhere.
5517000	5518000	I'm not approaching them.
5518000	5523000	It'll be midnight, and it's just adorable little pole cats sitting there,
5523000	5525000	and they just look at you, and then the dad or the mom,
5525000	5526000	I don't know which is which.
5526000	5527000	Pole cat?
5527000	5528000	Skunks, yeah.
5528000	5529000	Is that skunk?
5529000	5530000	Is that racist?
5531000	5532000	I don't...
5532000	5533000	You made it racist.
5533000	5534000	It's got to be offensive to somebody.
5534000	5536000	Aren't skunks pole cats?
5536000	5537000	Yeah.
5537000	5538000	Same thing.
5538000	5539000	Also, Mexican stand-up?
5539000	5540000	Mm-hmm.
5541000	5542000	Yeah.
5542000	5543000	Are you a realist?
5545000	5546000	Okay.
5546000	5548000	It's a gentrified stand-up.
5550000	5553000	It's part Armenian, part gay stand-off,
5554000	5557000	given way to a nice place with wine bars.
5558000	5560000	Do skunks make noises?
5560000	5561000	No.
5561000	5562000	I've never heard of making noises.
5562000	5565000	If you hear something, it's the sound of them spraying you.
5565000	5567000	I always stomp my foot on the pavement.
5567000	5569000	I don't fuck with skunks, because at one time...
5569000	5570000	Well, I don't fuck with them.
5570000	5572000	I just make a nuisance of myself and hope that they...
5573000	5574000	Yeah.
5574000	5575000	Spray you?
5575000	5576000	Is it a skunk?
5576000	5577000	No, I want to scare them.
5577000	5578000	A skunk?
5578000	5579000	I don't know what happened when I lived on Talmadge,
5579000	5581000	that shitty apartment, Talmadge and Franklin.
5582000	5583000	A skunk?
5583000	5585000	I don't know what happened, but the skunk must have exploded
5585000	5589000	underneath my door jam, because for a month,
5589000	5590000	I couldn't even be in my apartment,
5590000	5592000	because your eyes would just water.
5592000	5593000	When it's in close quarters like that,
5593000	5595000	it's like neurotoxinism.
5595000	5596000	Yeah.
5596000	5597000	That stuff's crazy.
5597000	5598000	Sorry, Colin.
5598000	5599000	Sorry about that.
5599000	5601000	He's exploring a new canyon tonight.
5601000	5604000	A kind of valley of entertainment.
5604000	5607000	A dangerous rocky ravine.
5607000	5609000	No bottom.
5609000	5611000	Hope you doubled your rope.
5612000	5615000	Colin, before we have you play,
5615000	5617000	possibly Camille's character in this,
5617000	5619000	anything that makes you cry?
5619000	5622000	Is there a trigger for you that could get you teary?
5622000	5623000	Flat land.
5623000	5624000	Mountains?
5625000	5626000	Hates them.
5627000	5629000	Like in film or music,
5629000	5631000	or you see a nice sunset,
5631000	5634000	or a certain kind of thought crosses your mind?
5634000	5636000	Nothing really actually comes to mind.
5636000	5637000	Are you a crier?
5637000	5638000	You're not a crier?
5638000	5640000	Sometimes when it strikes me,
5640000	5642000	I can't think of a...
5642000	5644000	There's not a genre that makes you cry.
5644000	5646000	You're not much of a crier, though.
5646000	5649000	I mean, it's not like you're rock solid,
5649000	5651000	but you're not super emotional.
5651000	5654000	Sometimes there's a moving moment in a movie,
5654000	5655000	but...
5655000	5656000	Did I get you?
5656000	5658000	That'll get me, but I can't really think of any.
5658000	5659000	How old are you, Colin?
5659000	5660000	I'm 25.
5660000	5661000	25.
5662000	5664000	Um, I...
5664000	5668000	Demorraj was so amazing playing Maureen Sedana.
5668000	5671000	I'm just gonna pick up where he left off.
5671000	5673000	I'm gonna do it his style for now on.
5674000	5676000	All right, Spencer, are you good to go?
5676000	5677000	Uh, yeah.
5677000	5678000	Sorry to make us wait so long.
5678000	5679000	Hey, it's cool.
5679000	5681000	I'm not feeling great.
5682000	5684000	Oh, let's play.
5686000	5688000	That's the perfect music cue.
5688000	5689000	Yeah.
5689000	5691000	That's the sound of my stomach.
5691000	5692000	This is the sound track.
5692000	5695000	Can you DM your stomach problems right now for us
5695000	5697000	before you get into that?
5697000	5701000	Gurgling in the soft darkness of the sack,
5701000	5705000	you feel that not all is where it should be,
5705000	5708000	but soon it would get there.
5709000	5710000	I don't know what that means.
5710000	5712000	That sounded right, right?
5712000	5713000	I don't know.
5713000	5714000	What up?
5714000	5715000	Should I keep stomaching?
5715000	5716000	D&D.
5716000	5718000	Yeah!
5718000	5721000	When we last met, our heroes had just joined forces
5721000	5724000	with the secret order of the Seekers of Paradise.
5724000	5726000	Charles Hoffman, their gnomish leader,
5726000	5729000	shared with the heroes a magical tablet,
5729000	5731000	which Quark activated, causing a dangerous
5731000	5733000	and deadly rift to open,
5733000	5737000	sucking our heroes through to unknown lands.
5737000	5739000	After licking their wounds,
5739000	5741000	Sharpie and the gang found themselves in a new land,
5741000	5743000	the Isle of Paradise,
5743000	5745000	where they encountered Yomiji,
5745000	5747000	the angel guardian of the Isle,
5747000	5748000	who demanded a joke,
5748000	5751000	a joke which Quark gladly supplied.
5751000	5754000	Yomiji relented accepting the gang's worthiness
5754000	5757000	and showing them to the Plants of Paradise.
5757000	5760000	The gang found the fabled Teragon of Virtue
5760000	5762000	and used it to force Admiral Darkstar's spirit
5762000	5763000	out of Christoperg,
5763000	5766000	initiating an epic ghost battle.
5766000	5768000	And after several blows,
5768000	5770000	the ghost pulled a desperate maneuver,
5770000	5773000	possessing Yomiji and taking control of his body.
5773000	5776000	Then Sharpie declared a retreat.
5776000	5780000	But would they truly be able to escape Darkstar's wrath,
5780000	5782000	or would they end up charred bits
5782000	5785000	on the end of Yomiji's flaming shovel?
5785000	5788000	Find out on an all-new harm in town.
5788000	5790000	Whoo!
5794000	5798000	Alright, so I think we all agreed we were running at the end.
5798000	5800000	We cliff-hand done running.
5800000	5803000	Yeah, so you guys have all that Teragon of Virtue.
5803000	5804000	You've got several clumps.
5804000	5806000	You're on the floating Isle of Paradise,
5806000	5808000	floating high above the land,
5808000	5809000	and it's an island.
5809000	5812000	So where are you running to?
5812000	5815000	I have a question for Sharpie.
5816000	5819000	What is this Teragon of Virtue capable of?
5819000	5821000	What, me? You're asking me?
5821000	5823000	Well, you can use it to do what we did,
5823000	5825000	which is get our friend uncursed.
5825000	5829000	But can't we go back and attack Yomiji with it?
5829000	5831000	We can try, but I tried to feed him some,
5831000	5834000	and it was just, he's really big and scary.
5834000	5838000	But we're running while we're talking.
5838000	5841000	I have my Armulet of Spring,
5841000	5844000	and we're in a fucking goddamn...
5844000	5848000	I've been waiting for months game time
5848000	5851000	for us to be in a place with growth.
5851000	5852000	I forgot I had it.
5852000	5854000	I could entangle his ass.
5854000	5855000	Alright.
5855000	5857000	So should I go back and kind of lure him along?
5857000	5859000	Is he chasing us right now, Spencer?
5859000	5860000	Oh, yeah.
5860000	5862000	Okay, so fucking no.
5862000	5865000	I look around and see if there's any sort of wooded areas
5865000	5868000	or bucolic kind of things.
5868000	5870000	What's bucolic mean?
5870000	5872000	Verdant.
5872000	5873000	Sure.
5873000	5874000	Okay.
5874000	5876000	The whole isle is very verdant,
5876000	5878000	but it's not super vegetated.
5878000	5879000	It's kind of sparse.
5879000	5882000	Like, even if you tried to hide in the one copes of trees
5882000	5885000	on the island, I'd see you.
5885000	5887000	For enemies, you know.
5887000	5889000	Sharpies, I don't have growth for it.
5889000	5891000	But my Armulet of Spring,
5891000	5893000	which has the kind of entangle thing to it.
5893000	5894000	Yeah.
5894000	5898000	Like, how reliant on verdantry is that?
5898000	5900000	Well, the Armulet's not.
5900000	5902000	It has vines as part of it,
5902000	5903000	and it shoots off those vines.
5903000	5904000	Oh, you're shitting me.
5904000	5906000	I could use that on a space shuttle?
5906000	5907000	Yeah.
5907000	5908000	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5908000	5910000	I always thought it was, like, entangled.
5910000	5912000	Yeah, well, Maureen has the entangle spell,
5912000	5913000	so she could do that,
5913000	5915000	but yours is part of your artifact.
5915000	5917000	Jesus Christ, I was like Boba Fett the whole time.
5917000	5919000	I could just...
5919000	5920000	Yeah.
5920000	5922000	Are you saying we should turn and fight?
5922000	5925000	I look around and see if there's any canyons nearby.
5925000	5928000	No, it's like an isle floated in air.
5928000	5929000	All right.
5929000	5931000	It's like a magical island,
5931000	5933000	like a desert island with one palm tree kind of thing,
5933000	5934000	but with more than that.
5934000	5935000	All right.
5935000	5937000	I say we're small, you know, not giant.
5937000	5938000	So we have nowhere to run to?
5938000	5939000	No, it's an island.
5939000	5940000	It's in the air.
5940000	5941000	Let's turn and fight.
5941000	5943000	Well, Rhode Island's an island.
5943000	5945000	There's lots of places to run if you go there.
5945000	5946000	You could go to New York.
5946000	5947000	You could go to Pennsylvania.
5947000	5949000	Rhode Island's not an island, though, is it?
5949000	5950000	All right.
5950000	5951000	Well, maybe that's why.
5951000	5955000	What if we try to light him on fire, burn him down?
5955000	5957000	Just light him on fire, the guy?
5957000	5958000	Isn't he like a monster?
5958000	5960000	He's a blazing angel.
5960000	5961000	He's already on fire.
5961000	5963000	He loves being on fire.
5963000	5966000	He woke up on fire, and he said, yay.
5966000	5970000	I think our only chance is using this tarragon of virtue
5970000	5972000	to release that.
5972000	5973000	Yeah.
5973000	5974000	He defended.
5974000	5976000	He tried to use mage hand to get some in his mouth,
5976000	5977000	and he blocked it.
5977000	5978000	Maybe it was just a bad move.
5978000	5980000	Why are we trying to feed it to him, though?
5980000	5982000	Well, that's another point.
5982000	5984000	Well, because every time we do that,
5984000	5987000	we've done it twice now, and the spirit comes out of him,
5987000	5989000	and it goes to someone else.
5989000	5992000	Now it's in somebody that I'm not going to say, well,
5992000	5995000	if we kill him, it's just going to come out of him, too.
5995000	5998000	I mean, this is like net neutrality.
5998000	6001000	It makes you want to give up.
6001000	6004000	You know, people from Comcast are working for the FCC.
6004000	6007000	Everyone that used to work for the FCC is working for Comcast.
6007000	6010000	How did we get up to the Isle of Paradise again?
6010000	6014000	You activated a magical tablet that sucked you through
6014000	6015000	and damaged you.
6015000	6018000	It created this portal to the island.
6018000	6020000	That portal still exists.
6020000	6022000	Let's go back to that portal.
6022000	6023000	Oh, shit, yeah.
6023000	6025000	If we're going to run, let's run correctly.
6025000	6028000	And then have him chase us through?
6028000	6032000	Well, I mean, then he'd just be in a gnome village.
6032000	6035000	He could fight the smoke monster from the cigarette store.
6035000	6036000	Remember that guy?
6036000	6037000	So we don't care about the gnome.
6037000	6039000	So, yeah, let's go to the portal.
6039000	6042000	I mean, we've never been good people.
6042000	6043000	But we did our job.
6043000	6045000	We got Christoperg healed.
6045000	6047000	Let's get the fuck out of here, right?
6047000	6048000	Yeah.
6048000	6049000	Sounds good to me.
6049000	6051000	Head for the portal.
6051000	6052000	All right, we run to the portal.
6052000	6057000	You run towards the portal, and it glows softly.
6057000	6060000	It's covered in dazzling, polygonal shapes
6060000	6065000	that kind of slough off of it like some sort of spray or water.
6065000	6066000	It's magical.
6066000	6068000	It looks painful, though.
6068000	6071000	Like you recall when you went through it, it hurt pretty bad.
6071000	6074000	Your skin was rent from your bodies in some places.
6074000	6077000	You remember that as you run towards the portal,
6077000	6079000	and you'll need you to chase you.
6079000	6084000	Should we try to get him to go first?
6084000	6087000	Yeah, at the last second, let's all just jump out of the way.
6087000	6094000	Yeah.
6094000	6098000	Look, I don't mind stopping, spreading out,
6098000	6101000	and kind of like attacking him from multiple directions.
6101000	6103000	Yeah, I said we'd put up a fight with this guy.
6103000	6104000	Let's fucking do it.
6104000	6105000	Yeah.
6105000	6106000	But here's the thing.
6106000	6107000	This is just table talk.
6107000	6110000	I'm not taking a turn having this conversation,
6110000	6113000	but I guess I should because this is what our characters are saying.
6113000	6115000	I could talk about this all day,
6115000	6118000	but instead I'm just going to talk about it.
6118000	6122000	If we kill him, it's the same effect as putting tarragon in his mouth,
6122000	6124000	which just seems to be an endless...
6124000	6127000	There's no fucking end in sight to this.
6127000	6130000	This dark star ghost comes out of him,
6130000	6132000	and it goes into someone else.
6132000	6134000	It's like Vietnam.
6134000	6135000	This is our Vietnam.
6135000	6137000	Yeah, but we haven't killed him.
6137000	6139000	Maybe it just stops when he does.
6139000	6140000	But we killed...
6140000	6142000	I mean, we...
6142000	6143000	Wait.
6143000	6146000	Didn't we kill somebody and then the ghost came out of him?
6146000	6150000	You stuffed tarragon into Charles Hoffman's mouth.
6150000	6153000	Okay, so we did that with Kumail, we did that with Charles Hoffman.
6153000	6156000	Okay, so we actually killed an entity that had this thing.
6156000	6159000	Maybe, and I know I just said that I was committing to playing like Demortch,
6159000	6165000	but what if I, with my supplies, built...
6165000	6167000	Here we go.
6167000	6168000	Don't fall off the wagon.
6168000	6170000	Did you get it, sweetie?
6170000	6171000	I'm not falling off the wagon.
6171000	6174000	I was just making a joke.
6174000	6178000	It felt real.
6178000	6183000	But what if, because he jumps into the nearest...
6183000	6187000	Is he jumping into the nearest vessel or the most...
6187000	6188000	I don't think so.
6188000	6189000	I think it's more random.
6189000	6190000	It's random.
6190000	6194000	So he's able to travel to something far away.
6194000	6199000	If we made a decoy vessel that we could burn,
6199000	6203000	if I was to build an ogre with a crown and be like,
6203000	6205000	that's the king of all ogres,
6205000	6207000	and have him there and feed him the tarragon,
6207000	6210000	I'd be like, oh, I'm going to jump into this king.
6210000	6215000	And we'd be like, no, it's made out of yarn.
6215000	6218000	And then we would set it on fire.
6218000	6220000	He's able to just travel.
6220000	6222000	He travels.
6222000	6226000	Sharpie, I think maybe he's just around forever.
6226000	6229000	Well, I didn't make him.
6229000	6231000	And also, I don't think he could go into sticks and stuff.
6231000	6232000	He can't go into sticks.
6232000	6234000	What if we took a pig's heart or something
6234000	6235000	and put him in the...
6235000	6237000	Let's just try to kill him.
6237000	6240000	I turn and fire an arrow.
6240000	6242000	There you go, Colin.
6242000	6245000	And we have SleepyCanyoneer.
6245000	6247000	You fire an arrow.
6247000	6249000	What's the damage on that?
6249000	6253000	Because you hit 1d6 plus what?
6253000	6255000	4.
6255000	6258000	Dealing 6 damage to Yomiji.
6258000	6262000	He takes an arrow in the thigh.
6262000	6264000	So we're fighting this guy now.
6264000	6265000	Well, he is.
6265000	6268000	I produce my armula to summer,
6268000	6270000	and I create my fire armor.
6270000	6273000	Breathing yourself in fire armor.
6273000	6276000	You feel the fire's warmth.
6276000	6278000	Do you want to do another thing?
6278000	6279000	Yeah.
6279000	6281000	Activating is pretty quick.
6281000	6284000	Once I'm on fire, I'm not sure what to do.
6284000	6287000	Oh, speaking of fire, the whole island's on fire.
6287000	6292000	You lit it on fire quark in the last episode.
6292000	6293000	I did?
6293000	6294000	Yeah, I forgot.
6294000	6299000	Fire blazes all around you, choking smoke.
6300000	6302000	Why'd you light the island of fire?
6302000	6303000	I don't remember that at all.
6303000	6307000	You used a flaming sword.
6307000	6308000	A fire sword.
6308000	6310000	Maybe we should take this fight through the portal.
6310000	6315000	I fire five fire arrows, which I guess are just arrows.
6315000	6316000	Yeah.
6316000	6317000	You can only do three.
6317000	6318000	Is three cool?
6318000	6321000	It says I can fire five arrows at once.
6321000	6325000	See, Demorj could do four with the wistler bow.
6325000	6326000	Demorj, Demorj was so great.
6326000	6328000	And I think that used up his opening.
6328000	6329000	I'll take three.
6329000	6330000	It's fine.
6330000	6331000	Okay.
6331000	6332000	It's a really good job.
6332000	6336000	I mean, the wistler arrow and red the sheet.
6339000	6341000	Two of your arrows strike true.
6341000	6345000	The other one, it just goes into the grass, the burning grass.
6345000	6347000	But two, two.
6347000	6348000	Yeah, two arrows.
6348000	6354000	Plunk into each of his shoulders, doing a total 19 damage.
6354000	6356000	Yeah!
6356000	6358000	I'm going to adventure you to death.
6358000	6362000	I call it my armament of winter and call us a snowstorm to put the fire out.
6362000	6363000	Whoosh.
6363000	6366000	Whoosh.
6366000	6372000	Smoke coalesces into clouds, which sprinkle sleet onto the fire.
6372000	6376000	It starts calming it in some of the less fiery areas.
6376000	6379000	But the blaze is still largely burning.
6379000	6382000	It's just more contained now.
6382000	6384000	I'm trying to help you guys.
6384000	6385000	It's helping.
6386000	6387000	But that doesn't take very long.
6387000	6388000	That's like activating the thing.
6388000	6389000	Is that my whole turn?
6389000	6390000	No.
6390000	6391000	It's not?
6391000	6392000	No.
6392000	6397000	Then I go into a rage and I do powerful blow.
6397000	6400000	Powerful blow!
6400000	6405000	And then it just starts talking about unbreakable all night.
6405000	6409000	I mean, it's really good blow.
6409000	6414000	Going into your rage and striking a powerful blow.
6414000	6415000	You do so.
6415000	6416000	What weapon was that?
6416000	6417000	Mighty greatsword.
6417000	6418000	What's the damage?
6418000	6421000	That's 2d8 plus 7.
6421000	6423000	2d8 plus 7.
6423000	6425000	Dealing 23 damage.
6425000	6427000	Fuck you!
6427000	6429000	You okay, team?
6429000	6430000	Do some blow.
6430000	6432000	Powerful blow.
6432000	6437000	If you're listening at home, kids, you just got to do powerful blow.
6437000	6440000	Perhaps you beat the angels.
6440000	6442000	That's good.
6442000	6448000	That goes out to four schizophrenic kids.
6448000	6449000	Put me in your note.
6449000	6451000	That's all I ask.
6451000	6453000	He's not kidding.
6453000	6457000	That's the term my fingers are not kidding.
6457000	6461000	I don't want to be in it.
6461000	6466000	It would be a guaranteed biopic, but I don't want it.
6467000	6469000	Am I up?
6469000	6470000	Sure.
6470000	6476000	I want to use my, I want to cast mage armor just because it's not because I'm selfish.
6476000	6477000	I'm just weak.
6477000	6479000	I need extra protection.
6479000	6480000	Touching your clothes.
6480000	6483000	They become stiff and armorous.
6483000	6491000	And then if I have time left, I'd like to try to ensnare this angelic biatch with my armulite of spring.
6491000	6492000	All right.
6492000	6494000	Activating your armulite of spring.
6494000	6497000	You attempt to do so.
6497000	6503000	And he gets caught by the legs, by your vines, and kind of, he can't move so well.
6503000	6508000	He's not immobile, but he's definitely kind of stuck.
6508000	6509000	You know?
6509000	6510000	Not great.
6510000	6511000	Okay.
6511000	6512000	We got him or we want him, you guys.
6512000	6513000	Yeah.
6513000	6514000	Colin?
6514000	6518000	So he starts swinging his flaming axe around.
6518000	6524000	And he's trying to just, you know, generally start fires and attack people in his general vicinity.
6524000	6532000	He doesn't hit anybody, but he does manage to strike kind of the entanglements, and he slashes those off.
6532000	6533000	Lame.
6533000	6535000	And then he shoots eye lasers.
6535000	6537000	But he misses.
6537000	6539000	Not your day, Yamichi.
6539000	6541000	No, it's not.
6541000	6543000	That would be Colin's turn.
6543000	6544000	Yeah.
6544000	6545000	I want to try to sneak up behind him.
6545000	6546000	Yeah.
6546000	6547000	All right.
6547000	6549000	I'm focusing on your best sneaking-ness.
6549000	6552000	You try and sneak up on him.
6552000	6554000	You're not very sneaky.
6554000	6556000	But you are behind him.
6556000	6557000	I am behind him, though.
6557000	6558000	Yep.
6558000	6559000	All right.
6559000	6561000	I stab him with my poison dagger.
6561000	6563000	With the poison dagger.
6563000	6566000	Use that poison dagger through my heart.
6566000	6569000	I hate it.
6569000	6571000	Stabbing with your poison dagger.
6571000	6575000	Your knife sinks into his angel flesh.
6575000	6578000	But it doesn't seem to do any damage.
6578000	6580000	It's weird.
6580000	6581000	Just doesn't.
6581000	6584000	Maybe it's because you weren't sneaky enough.
6584000	6585000	Hmm.
6585000	6587000	Sorry.
6587000	6590000	Was it me, Jeff's turn, or is it Maureen's next?
6590000	6591000	Maureen's next.
6591000	6592000	Sure.
6592000	6596000	Not today, Yamichi.
6596000	6599000	I'm going to use my...
6599000	6603000	Was that your turn?
6603000	6609000	She cast Magic Singer.
6609000	6614000	It's about to get really hot.
6614000	6615000	Doesn't make any sense.
6615000	6616000	Okay.
6616000	6618000	I'm going to use my Whisper Bow.
6618000	6619000	All right.
6619000	6622000	And I'm going to whisper in Elvish.
6622000	6626000	Scrubby-doo-yubby-ubby.
6626000	6629000	Loo-dee-bee-eye-yo.
6629000	6631000	Ma-ma-ma-ma-ya.
6631000	6637000	Tikka-tok-ch-cheetah-cheetos.
6637000	6642000	Bicycle pump-eye.
6642000	6644000	You whisper with your Whisper Bow,
6644000	6646000	but it only works once per day,
6646000	6649000	so your whispering is in vain.
6649000	6652000	No, I wasn't.
6652000	6655000	I heard it.
6655000	6657000	You can still fire three arrows,
6657000	6659000	but not the Whisper Bow style.
6659000	6660000	Okay.
6660000	6663000	Well, so I guess I do that.
6663000	6666000	Okay.
6666000	6669000	I also blow up a balloon because nothing matters.
6669000	6673000	Firing three arrows, two of them fly off the island
6673000	6675000	never to be seeing again.
6675000	6676000	Goodbye!
6677000	6679000	Hits Yomiji right in his pectoral
6679000	6681000	and deals four damage.
6681000	6682000	Ha-ha!
6682000	6684000	Burned.
6684000	6685000	Spencer, what a surprise.
6685000	6687000	Oh, sorry, moment of clarity.
6687000	6689000	Moment of clarity.
6689000	6692000	It always comes after doing way too much powerful blow.
6692000	6697000	Turn around and look at the clock.
6697000	6702000	I cast Morten Kanan's Rock Bottom.
6702000	6705000	I cast Staring Too Long in the Mirror.
6705000	6708000	I summon sponsor.
6708000	6711000	I summon my spirit sponsor
6711000	6717000	to help me get the powder out of the tile grout.
6717000	6721000	It lets you not be as crazed when you're in a rage.
6721000	6727000	Can I use that and do a power attack?
6727000	6729000	Yeah, yeah, sure.
6729000	6731000	All right, so I take my Mighty Greatsword
6731000	6733000	and I summon my moment of clarity
6733000	6735000	and I do a...
6735000	6738000	Where am I in relationship to him right now?
6738000	6741000	Uh, you know, in front maybe?
6741000	6743000	How tall is he?
6743000	6744000	He's 12 feet tall.
6744000	6745000	12 feet tall.
6745000	6747000	All right, I go...
6747000	6750000	Is he kind of standing with his legs apart?
6750000	6751000	Yep.
6751000	6753000	Okay, I come running in and I change it.
6753000	6755000	I do a moment of clarity, a Forest Sword attack.
6755000	6757000	I run between his legs and do a Forest Sword
6757000	6759000	and try to cleave him right in two,
6759000	6762000	right up his wiener, like through his hands.
6762000	6766000	You only got one Forest Sword per day also, I think.
6766000	6768000	So you should be out.
6768000	6769000	Say what?
6769000	6770000	I think you only have one Forest Sword per day.
6770000	6772000	Okay, I'll just jump into a Greatsword
6772000	6774000	right through his crotch.
6774000	6776000	In summoning a brief moment of clarity,
6776000	6779000	you weigh your options before launching yourself
6779000	6784000	directly at his scrotal sack.
6784000	6785000	You've gone from pretty woman to monster.
6785000	6787000	Wait, can I go back in time?
6787000	6788000	Can I go back in time a little bit?
6788000	6789000	Sure.
6789000	6790000	Can I put a little Tarragon of Virtue
6790000	6792000	on the tip of my sword, just in case,
6792000	6793000	and see if that does anything?
6793000	6794000	Yep.
6794000	6796000	All right, I go over whoever has a Tarragon of Virtue,
6796000	6798000	I put some on my sword, and just in case,
6798000	6800000	that might be like a poison,
6800000	6802000	or some sort of magical thing.
6802000	6805000	And I do the same attack up the butt.
6805000	6808000	Swinging wildly with your power attack,
6808000	6812000	your powerful swing is not as accurate as a normal,
6812000	6815000	barbarian-style non-power attack swinging,
6815000	6817000	and just nicks him in the leg.
6817000	6819000	It doesn't hurt.
6820000	6822000	What about the femoral artery?
6822000	6824000	Don't angels have those?
6824000	6826000	Not angels.
6826000	6828000	That was a bunch of shit.
6828000	6830000	Yeah, your intent is good.
6830000	6831000	What about demons?
6831000	6832000	Powerful.
6832000	6833000	All right, it's 10.03.
6833000	6834000	Yeah.
6834000	6835000	When's it my turn?
6835000	6836000	It's your turn now.
6836000	6837000	It's yours right now.
6837000	6838000	Okay, I said check this out.
6838000	6839000	Make it count, baby.
6839000	6840000	Just this bad boy out.
6840000	6841000	Make it count.
6841000	6847000	Why don't you pick on someone our size?
6847000	6849000	Reduce person.
6849000	6851000	Oh.
6851000	6854000	Smallinus ordinarus.
6854000	6858000	Giantus angelus cum humanus.
6858000	6859000	He does so.
6859000	6862000	Shrinking down to six feet tall.
6865000	6867000	Scribbledy-dee, scribbledy-doo,
6867000	6872000	what once was large is now like you.
6872000	6873000	Cliffhanger.
6873000	6875000	Cliffhanger.
6878000	6880000	Thank you, Colin.
6880000	6881000	Colin?
6881000	6884000	Colin, the sleepy canyoneer.
6888000	6890000	Aaron McGathey.
6893000	6894000	Spencer Crittenden.
6894000	6896000	I'm Jeff Davis.
6897000	6899000	Thank you, everybody.
6899000	6902000	Your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6902000	6904000	Thank you, Zach.
6904000	6905000	Do you just thank Zach?
6905000	6907000	Zach McKeever and Dustin Marshall
6907000	6909000	and everybody here at Meltdown Conference.
6909000	6910000	We love you all.
6911000	6913000	Drive fast and take chances.
