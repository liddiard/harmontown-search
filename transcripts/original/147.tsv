0	22000	From Hollywood, California, meltdown comics, nerd melt meter, Harman town, now in session.
22000	26000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
39000	43000	Hello. Hello everybody. Hi. Hi, how are you? Let's get down to business.
45000	50000	How you doing, Dan? I'm good. Sorry I brought the energy down with my hello. I don't know why I did that.
50000	54000	I think we've created as a pregnant pause. Pregnant with possibility.
54000	60000	Oh. Impregnated by possibility. Pregnant with potential.
63000	65000	Now you brought the mood down.
66000	68000	All right, Jeff, let's run through my notes.
71000	74000	Hey, okay, so are there any British people in the audience?
75000	76000	All right. Wow.
77000	90000	Well, but so what is with the word aluminum? Like, like, like, because we, it's spell, it's, did we discover it?
91000	94000	And then they heard about it but didn't see how it was spelled?
95000	103000	I think they think they discovered it because Kate, my Scottish ex-girlfriend, she was emphatic about aluminium and wouldn't her otherwise.
103000	109000	There's an, there's an I that's not there. Yeah. It's not like nuclear where we say it wrong.
110000	117000	You know, I would, I would definitely just assume that, you know, we're, we're Americans and well, we do everything wrong, but they're wrong about this.
118000	123000	Aluminium? Knock it off. All right.
125000	130000	Hey, do you think dogs know how to share with each other? No. Okay. All right.
134000	141000	I think dogs are a pack mentality. There's alpha, beta, and so on. And so the beta will always defer to the alpha of any group.
142000	149000	Right. And so when there's owners there, because we have these sticks, these like pepperoni sticks that the dogs really like, they love them.
150000	156000	But Harvey, the big one, he, he eats, he tries to eat them slow and you can see him watching Nigel, the little tiny one.
157000	165000	And like Nigel just puts it between his paws and does that little thing where he's just like nibbling at the end and he just loves licking and nibbling it with his little needle teeth.
166000	175000	And, and Harvey just sits across the room and watches him while he like shops it like, like a candy bar. It's like gone in three bites, but he wishes it wasn't and he just stares at Nigel.
176000	180000	And then he starts doing laps, but he's like, he's got one eye on Nigel and one eye on me all the time.
180000	186000	Like, like, cause I think that means that he know if I think if I walked out of the room, he'd steal the other dogs. Yeah.
187000	196000	Look at, uh, runts of the litter, like puppies won't share the teats. One puppy is going to be the, you know, get no milk and be a little runt.
197000	203000	Right. But dogs have to get socialized into the rule. I mean, yeah, puppies, certainly they don't share. Of course they're like little blind larva.
204000	208000	They're just looking for, they don't even, they probably don't even know they're not sharing. They probably think they are.
209000	214000	The mothers disagree with you about, about pie.
215000	222000	But the mothers don't even like, like try to distribute evenly. They just like, they just lay there and say fucking first come first serve baby.
223000	229000	Yeah. What, what do you do? Do adult do the mother dogs? Do they go like, all right, come on, this guy doesn't get as much.
230000	234000	They lay there and just go, Jesus Christ, I got 17 people sucking on my tits right now.
235000	257000	How would you feel then? Do you think that feels good? Because I just thought that would feel good when you said that. I was like, well, that would feel 17, 17 times as good as, as when you get a little nipple play.
258000	267000	My nipples are extremely sensitive. I don't like a whole lot of nipple play. Yeah, we've been over this. Yeah, you said you don't like, you're not a nipple guy.
268000	275000	I just don't, I just don't need a whole lot of it. Yeah. Well, nobody does. That's the beauty of nipples. That's the point. I mean, I mean, I don't really need any of it.
276000	283000	All right. We're back to, back to alienation. Okay. I thought, I thought maybe there was a misunderstanding like, no, no, no, you know, there's, there's supposed to be sensitive.
284000	293000	Yeah. Okay. That's, that's the selling point. I think mine are more, I think mine are more sensitive than people that enjoy it because it's like, it's like, it's, it's, it's really like, it's a lot. There's an overload.
294000	302000	All right. Uh, uh, so, uh, uh, pop pop culture corner. All right. I don't know what that other stuff was.
303000	313000	Sometimes the society's made out of things that aren't art or, uh, education or war. We call them pop culture.
317000	318000	Uh, where'd you get that?
320000	325000	That is, uh, it's our friend, Kevin McCloud, who gave us a family. Oh,
326000	339000	from the clan McCloud. Um, holy ground. Um, I got something to say. It's better to burn out than fade away.
340000	351000	It's Highlander. Uh, okay. So there's a hot hamburger. That's it. It's been, it's been in the news for ages. If you don't know you're, you're, you're not hip.
351000	361000	There's a hot hamburger. They got Jake, Jake Gyllenhaal's playing the hamburger now. Yeah. Jake Gyllenhaal. I mean, hey, did you see, have you seen that movie Nightcrawler?
362000	370000	Uh, is that Jake Gyllenhaal? Okay, good. I always get them confused with the other guy. Who's the other guy? Uh, Martin Luther King.
371000	379000	Yes. Uh, I'm sure they, they're sick of seeing each other in casting sessions. Those guys, I have a nightmare.
382000	387000	That Jake's out for this part too. That was my Martin Luther King impression.
388000	399000	Mm. I'd like some toast. It's a very sensitive, very cautious Martin Luther King impression. Hello.
402000	411000	Do you know the way to the library so I can continue to be a very smart person? My name's Martin Luther King.
412000	432000	I was murdered. Oh my God, a ghost! A ghost! Yeah, I'm here. It's me. I'm a ghost. Uh, boo. I don't know what, I don't know. I'm on a weird, are you, are you, or is it me tonight?
433000	438000	Dr. King, what do you, what's your favorite thing to go haunting now that you're a ghost?
439000	456000	Well, uh, you know, as you know, like, I don't want to do the whole dream thing. Like Freddy Krueger, you know, like, you know, every time you have a dream and then I'm there and it's like, this is my dream.
457000	474000	Because I feel like fun's fun, but it undercuts my larger message. But I want to turn, turn the importance of my life into a bit in death. Even though I will be dead far longer than I was alive and that is something you should be warned about.
475000	485000	It's going to get boring. Enjoy it and stop being racist. I don't know how many times I have to say it. It's a waste of your life.
486000	499000	Is there racism in the afterlife? There are racist ghosts. There are people who, who died racist. And so they're, they can't get not racist. They're just walking around going, look at all these black people.
500000	509000	And they're upset. And it's, that's what they deserve because they can't do anything about it. You can't segregate with, with, with non-corporeal hands.
509000	524000	You can't, you can't separate people when you're, when your body is a vapor. They deserve it. And I'm not a, I've never, I was not famous for being a judgmental person in my life, but I think they deserve it.
524000	541000	When, when I, when I died, I had, I had two immediate thoughts. One was like, why the fuck am I not in heaven? This is insane. Why am I, why am I a ghost to me? And then my second thought was like,
541000	546000	Oh, so if you're a ghost, it's neither heaven nor hell. That's purgatory kind of style or what? Like, is that the deal?
546000	565000	Well, I, I, I, I ain't seen no, uh, harps. I ain't seen no harps. Someone just repeated it in the audience. I don't, um, anyways, it's, I, look, I was never going to make an exciting ghost. That's the fact.
566000	569000	Who's your, who's your, who's your role model ghost? Who's your favorite most entertaining ghost?
569000	576000	I'm glad you asked. Come on out. Come on out, Napoleon. Suck my booze! Suck my booze! Suck my booze!
576000	579000	Suck my booze! Suck my booze!
579000	585000	I didn't think of it the first time. I said blue and then I was like, oh fuck, boo boo! Suck my booze!
585000	590000	Wait a second sir. Napoleon, wait, hang on. You just keep, you just came up with suck my booze just now in front of us?
590000	596000	Yeah, yeah, we, we, uh, I'm, I'm constantly inventing and experimenting.
596000	598000	You've been dead for like almost 200 years.
598000	607000	We! There's a thousand things to do when you die. You float around, you look at the people. Suck my booze!
607000	614000	I just now got to LA. I never knew about it. Oh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a Napoleon ghost.
614000	619000	Napoleon, are you okay?
619000	625000	Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I, I got ghost pneumonia.
625000	628000	But you, you can't die from ghost pneumonia, can't you?
628000	635000	No, that's why it's so bad. You just keep coughing. You can't get rid of it. There's no ghost medicine.
635000	639000	Why do I sound like Cheech Marin?
639000	643000	You sound like Cheech Marin who might have lived in Frankfurt for a while.
644000	647000	Dave's not here, man!
647000	652000	Um, alright, so anyways. Yeah, that was Pop Culture Corner.
652000	655000	Yeah, you guys like segments, right?
655000	661000	I'm just staring at my phone and there's not a lot on here. Look, I just wanted to, uh, you know, I think we have some entertaining guests.
661000	665000	But we do have to, as I tweeted, uh, we, we don't have Spencer tonight.
665000	667000	No!
667000	670000	But we're going to make the best of it, you know?
670000	672000	Yeah.
673000	676000	A general malaise has fallen over the crowd.
676000	679000	Maybe the ghost of Spencer will come by.
679000	682000	Well, I don't mean that he died.
682000	688000	I mean the ghost of his presence. The ghost of his, his enthusiasm.
688000	694000	Which, which I do think died around episode three.
694000	699000	I would believe that his enthusiasm is a ghost walking around somewhere.
700000	708000	Alright, so, uh, well, okay, so, well, I don't, not to bring things down, but, um, like, uh, so, like, alright, dog sharing.
708000	712000	Alright, so, well, they got that, they got that new Uber program.
712000	717000	There's a, they keep adding the things. It keeps getting, there's like more and more things in the bottom of Uber.
717000	723000	And now the, the thing on the left most is Uber pool, where you can, like, pool with Uber people.
723000	728000	And then Erin was like, I, I don't think I'd ever do that.
728000	737000	She's like, well, wait, I'd do that before I'd take a regular Uber because of all the, you know, harassment and creepy, creepiness that goes on in your average Uber.
737000	744000	And I was wondering if that was their point. Like, maybe Uber pool is them, like, they, because they can't say Uber chaperone.
744000	751000	Like, maybe they really are like, hey, for the ladies, um, uh, well, there'll be another person there.
752000	753000	Alright, so, uh,
753000	760000	Aren't you just doubling or tripling down on more guys getting in the car with your wife and saying like, hey, what are you guys doing later on?
760000	764000	Well, I guess that's what, that was my thought was like, how likely is it, how, how does this pool thing work?
764000	772000	I was wondering if maybe that's like, uh, maybe it's a fake thing where the third person is always just a licensed social worker or something.
772000	773000	A federal marshal, yeah.
774000	782000	And they're just like, they just clear their throat a lot whenever the driver's like, so should I take a left up here?
782000	785000	Um, no, no, take a right. Oh, sweetie, you don't know anything.
786000	788000	Uh, yes, okay. Left end.
790000	795000	Uh, yeah. Anyways, so, okay, so do you think Curtis Armstrong is mad at us?
796000	797000	No, why? What happened?
797000	804000	I don't know. He said he was going, because I'm always drunk during the show and I don't know if like,
806000	808000	Did anything happen at the end of the last show he was on?
808000	809000	No, not at all.
809000	810000	Just making sure.
810000	813000	We professed our love to him, he accepted that love.
813000	816000	I was at the top of the show and then I was like, okay, now the other shoe's gonna drop.
816000	820000	And then usually the show ends in a blackout for me.
820000	824000	Like, I don't really, I kind of have to listen to the end of the show.
824000	826000	That's why, that's why our role playing games are so bad.
826000	829000	Like, by the end of the show, I'm a little gone.
829000	832000	So, like, I can't, it's a little bit of a fog, you know?
832000	838000	And I was, I just, I remember talking about boxers and, you know, we touched on, I don't know,
838000	845000	like, I couldn't remember, like, because, well, he just, he hasn't responded to my direct tweets,
845000	847000	which is how we usually communicate.
847000	852000	And I just, I've just been really paranoid about, about, about Curtis being upset.
853000	855000	He says he's going to England.
855000	857000	He says he's going to England, yeah, but, I mean, yeah.
857000	858000	Twitter there.
858000	860000	Yeah, he's with his daughter on vacation.
860000	864000	They don't have, they don't have the word aluminum there, but they have Twitter.
864000	866000	All right, fine, he's like spending time with his daughter.
866000	867000	He doesn't check his tweets.
867000	868000	Fine.
868000	869000	Yeah.
869000	871000	Good.
871000	876000	I'm not, I'm not gonna be worried about it.
876000	877000	I think you're fine.
877000	878000	I think you're fine.
878000	879000	All right.
879000	880000	I think he's very happy here.
881000	884000	If there was anything, there was maybe a moment of sincerity where we all agreed that we all
884000	885000	like each other.
885000	889000	And then we talked about how long it took for us to hang out, and then it took for ages
889000	893000	for us to actually hang out as friends and not, like, meet at a party or whatever.
893000	894000	Yeah, that was at the beginning.
894000	897000	By the end of the show, though, it was like, we were talking about boxing, and I was like,
897000	898000	well, it'd be great.
898000	899000	McDonald's, black people, blah, blah, blah.
899000	904000	And I just don't know if I, like, if that bulldozer had any casualties, you know?
904000	905000	I don't think so.
905000	908000	I mean, I, Justin just brought your mail.
911000	912000	Do you get paid to do the show?
912000	915000	Is that, is that your check?
921000	924000	Sis, boom, bah.
925000	926000	Sis, boom, bah.
934000	937000	What is the sound of a sheep exploding?
938000	939000	I'm stealing from Johnny Carson, everybody.
939000	940000	Johnny Carson.
940000	941000	No, no.
941000	946000	I have a note about our guest tonight and what his, if we play Shadowrun, what his character
946000	947000	will be.
947000	948000	Oh, I see.
948000	950000	Okay, well, I actually, we should bring up our first guest.
950000	953000	I'm kind of excited because we haven't, I don't think we've ever, we haven't really
953000	956000	had a lot of, is he, is he back there?
956000	958000	What's that?
958000	960000	Yes, he's back there, right?
960000	961000	Okay, all right.
961000	966000	Because we, we never, we've never done the political thing like in the sense of like,
966000	970000	like we've never had anybody come on the show to actually help, help them politically.
970000	972000	Like, this is kind of an exciting thing.
972000	976000	Like they have a show, you know, like the Daily Show or something like that, where people
976000	977000	announce they're keen to see.
977000	980000	I mean, now it's, it's, it's, it's presidential election season.
980000	981000	Right.
981000	983000	And we've become a very important show.
983000	987000	But I, I truly hope, Dan, that we're not going to, like no one's going to come on this show
987000	990000	and use that to stump for their, for their own political gain.
990000	994000	I think that any candidate that was going to come on this show would be doing so because
994000	1000000	they had decided that this, this demographic is savvy and young and critical thinkers and,
1000000	1005000	you know, it's skeptical and that their votes matter the most in what is sure to be a very
1005000	1006000	important election.
1006000	1009000	I mean, you guys know how I feel about politics.
1009000	1014000	I didn't, I didn't, when I heard this guy was coming on the show, I didn't at all have
1014000	1015000	to say, wait, who's that?
1015000	1018000	And have Demarge explain it to me.
1019000	1024000	It's, you, you, you, you, you, well, there's a, it's a, he's a, he's a Republican candidate
1024000	1029000	and he's, he's, he's been in the news a lot lately.
1029000	1034000	He's a little controversial, but, but he's, he's, he, I have no, I don't know anything
1034000	1035000	about him.
1035000	1039000	And, but I know you guys have heard all about him and you're always tweeting about him.
1039000	1041000	Let's welcome Bernie Sanders.
1041000	1044000	Senator Bernie Sanders.
1045000	1048000	Wow.
1052000	1053000	Senator.
1053000	1056000	Pleasure to meet you, Senator.
1056000	1060000	He can just grab any mic you want to sit anywhere you feel comfortable.
1060000	1063000	I assume the mics were rigged with union workers.
1063000	1066000	That's good to know.
1066000	1068000	I should clarify the introduction.
1068000	1069000	I'm not a Republican.
1069000	1070000	Oh.
1070000	1071000	I'm an avowed socialist.
1071000	1076000	I'm the only independent Senator from the state of Vermont in the United States Senate,
1076000	1082000	but I'm running for president as a Democrat because well, I like to change things up.
1082000	1084000	I got, I got my information wrong from Demarge.
1084000	1086000	I thought you were like the new Herman Cain.
1086000	1088000	Look, you get your information wrong.
1088000	1092000	Like the American people get inaccurate information from the mainstream media,
1092000	1095000	which is controlled by five corporations.
1095000	1096000	It's the same situation.
1096000	1103000	What we're fighting against is the top 1% that controls more than the bottom 60% combined.
1103000	1112000	And if you look at the numbers closer, it's the top 10% of the top 12% of the top 1.1% year on year labor adjusted statistics.
1112000	1113000	Yeah.
1113000	1121000	That has more growth than a lot of, a lot of, a lot of further statistics, further down the line.
1121000	1124000	You can't argue with that.
1124000	1130000	So, well, I mean, I mean, we've all seen those charts and stuff about wealth distribution.
1130000	1133000	What do you say to the people that say like.
1133000	1146000	Did you know that over two thirds of charts that are used to illustrate economic data contains more blue and red graph sections than the 99% of the working class,
1146000	1153000	40% that operates somewhere with between the chocolate and vanilla layers of the middle class cake.
1154000	1162000	Senator Sanders, do you feel that a lot of people think that you might be drawing votes away from, from Hillary?
1162000	1164000	Sure. No, I don't think there's any danger of that.
1164000	1169000	And everybody working on my campaign is well aware.
1169000	1171000	Is there any truth?
1171000	1175000	I never want to be a gotcha question kind of interviewer.
1175000	1177000	Well, that's fine.
1177000	1180000	My life is an open book specifically.
1180000	1188000	It's a 20,000 page printout of the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for the fiscal year 2014 to 2015.
1188000	1191000	And it's all dot matrix too. It's all dot matrix printer.
1191000	1194000	Well, yes, because I believe in fiscal accountability.
1194000	1198000	So I print on very cheap paper, which is still a dot matrix printer.
1198000	1205000	If I need, if I need further copies, I use a mimeograph machine because I'm from the 1970s.
1206000	1212000	Senator Sanders, is there any truth to the allegations that your hair is actually a sideways wig?
1219000	1225000	Look, I hope we're going to, I hope we delve into some hard numbers after this because I think this is a distraction from the issues.
1225000	1228000	But since it's brought up, I will address it for the people.
1229000	1240000	My hair is harvested on a monthly to bi-monthly basis to provide cotton candy for younger Americans
1240000	1244000	who come from a socioeconomic background where they could not afford cotton candy.
1244000	1246000	And as you know, the summer months are approaching.
1246000	1255000	So I've donated recently my real hair as cotton candy to some lower income children in Vermont.
1255000	1270000	Yes, I do replace it with two wigs that are lowered onto my head by union labor like Darth Vader in the rotunda of the Capitol building.
1270000	1278000	I think both the mortgage and I in the green room, when we heard your name, thought you were that black guy, that crazy doctor guy.
1278000	1281000	Look, I don't agree with him on the issues, but I respect him.
1281000	1283000	Bernie, the other one, sure.
1283000	1286000	Look, I think I compare very well.
1286000	1287000	Ben Carson?
1287000	1288000	Ben Carson?
1288000	1292000	I'm so relieved that the mortgage also had no clue.
1292000	1294000	I'm way out of the loop here.
1294000	1300000	Look, wishful thinking, look, I'm a presidential candidate that everyone agrees with on everything, but no one will vote for me.
1300000	1303000	You sound like you're singing my tune, for sure.
1303000	1315000	If one-third of the two-thirds who support my positions were to vote for me, that would be one-sixth of the population that would vote for me, and we wouldn't win the election either.
1315000	1316000	Oh, okay.
1316000	1318000	So you think it would be difficult.
1318000	1320000	You don't think you're going to win.
1320000	1323000	Look, I don't think I'm here to talk about winning and losing.
1323000	1328000	I think that's the problem with American capitalism, that we've been obsessed too much with the losers.
1328000	1340000	And that's how the middle $40 billion in the federal budget goes to the top 1% of the top 2% of the top, let's say, 17% of the country.
1340000	1346000	Is this just kind of a thinly veiled ploy, this run, this bid for the presidency?
1346000	1349000	Are you aiming to maybe settle in at vice president?
1349000	1356000	Look, I don't have any aspirations further than maybe a nice walk, maybe a nice cup of warm chocolate from time to time.
1356000	1359000	Senator Sanders, is there any truth?
1359000	1361000	Hold on a second.
1361000	1363000	Let me finish the question, Mr. Sanders.
1363000	1367000	Look, if provoked, I will fill a muster.
1367000	1369000	Let me finish the question.
1369000	1376000	Is there or is there not any truth to the allegation that you are wearing my mom's glasses?
1377000	1393000	That's a reasonable question because what I am doing is wearing glasses that are of the model that is widely available to librarians and mothers across this country who have to work in humiliating conditions as public workers in the education and library systems.
1393000	1402000	And so in solidarity, I wear the glasses that are the minimally covered glasses that you have to wear if you have public health care in these professions.
1403000	1408000	Look, see, we're resonating with people who will not vote for me, but we're resonating with them.
1408000	1413000	They don't even correct my vision to the right degree.
1413000	1420000	I wear them merely to be in solidarity with the working, the hardest working people of this country.
1423000	1425000	I've been very impressed by you.
1425000	1430000	What little I know about you, you've been very strongly in support of women's rights and equal pay.
1430000	1437000	I feel like that would be like the most appealing thing for me as a voter is that you actually stand up for the women.
1437000	1440000	Look, women are 50% of the population.
1440000	1442000	But if we really dig into the numbers.
1442000	1444000	How many percent is 50%?
1444000	1456000	Look, the bottom 40% of all 50% is equal to the top 12% of the middle, I don't know, Avogadro's number.
1457000	1465000	I feel like I really have this urge to bring Barack Obama out here and have you guys have like a little debate.
1465000	1469000	Look, I would be happy to go toe to toe with the President of the United States.
1469000	1470000	Let's bring him out.
1470000	1472000	Let's bring him out, Barack Obama.
1472000	1474000	Is he here? Is he here?
1475000	1477000	I think he might be taking a shit.
1480000	1482000	Okay, he's here.
1483000	1485000	Thank you.
1485000	1488000	Mr. President, Mr. President.
1488000	1490000	Thank you, sir.
1490000	1492000	Mr. Obama, sorry about that.
1492000	1494000	Mr. President, how was your shit?
1496000	1498000	Was it a bit brief?
1499000	1501000	Now, in the green room...
1501000	1503000	Certainly it was instantaneous.
1504000	1517000	If elected President, my shits will all be short in duration, with minimal about spent out of the federal budget on cleaning up the smell of the room afterwards.
1521000	1525000	These are your salad days.
1526000	1528000	You can say things like that.
1529000	1531000	I'm sorry, did you say salad days?
1531000	1532000	Yes.
1532000	1534000	I don't eat anything as exotic as salad.
1536000	1539000	My diet consists of oatmeal, mostly.
1539000	1543000	I can occasionally porridge, and if it's a celebration, I get some raisins.
1546000	1548000	Isn't that a bit extravagant, Mr. Sanders?
1548000	1555000	Look, a box of raisins in 1970 contained over 40 grapes that had been shrunk down to an edible raisin size.
1556000	1570000	Today, over 40 years later, that same box of raisins contains over 20% less grapes from farm to plate because of Monsanto and genetically modified organisms,
1571000	1581000	which I will fight to stop in the impossible scenario where I occupy the White House for even two or three weeks before the Pentagon calls a coup d'etat
1582000	1588000	because I am simply unacceptable to anyone with power to be in the office.
1589000	1594000	But you were also implying that likewise, you don't think people will vote for you, all the powerless people.
1595000	1602000	Of course, the grandpas of the world don't want you anywhere near the throne, but you think the voters of the world are also a little jaded.
1603000	1607000	Well, that's what I'm running for. I'm running for the young people, the people out there who are burdened.
1608000	1610000	Now, I'm entering a pandering section.
1611000	1613000	You see, here's the thing.
1615000	1619000	Wait, hold on. Let me do my Looney Tunes stopping sound.
1621000	1622000	Go ahead.
1626000	1628000	You can talk a fair game right now.
1628000	1629000	Sure.
1631000	1637000	When you get into the room, the Oval Room, there's a red phone.
1638000	1640000	The red phone might ring. It might be the middle of the night.
1641000	1643000	That's no concern to me. I'm color-blight.
1645000	1653000	I'll treat every phone of every color with the same respect that I would treat an average gray phone,
1654000	1659000	operating year-on-year on original AT&T payphone wires.
1662000	1672000	Mr. Obama, if I might, Mr. President, I might say, I think I respect you as a person and as an antagonist over a nice game of mahjong.
1673000	1680000	And don't forget, Mr. Sanders, Senator, I guess you're a senator. I thought you were a doctor because I thought you were a completely different human being.
1681000	1684000	You could use his support. I mean, you're not even running against him. This might be a good time to...
1685000	1692000	Look, I would, but I'm not accepting support from any corporations or any human being that's made up specifically of corporations,
1693000	1696000	which includes Mr. Obama, and as much as I respect you as a person,
1697000	1702000	I think that you, as a labor organizer, did more good for this country than you have occupied the White House.
1703000	1708000	Look, the cadence and the volume was there for the crowd to agree, but still to this day,
1709000	1714000	not even in the waning days of a presidency that could only be argued as a failure,
1715000	1718000	people are still on his side comedically, room by room.
1719000	1721000	I think this country... I would argue that these days are not waning.
1722000	1727000	I think this country's ready for a socialist Jewish president. That would be an awesome change of pace.
1728000	1734000	Look, I don't think there's a problem with that, but look, if people are worried that that's unpopular, socialist Jewish, don't worry.
1735000	1745000	I'm also an atheist, and I used to... Look, I have a very popular time everywhere I go.
1748000	1759000	I don't think we need to dwell on that any further. I think, look, the bottom 40% of the top 60% of the 11% who've even heard of me
1760000	1767000	have 50-50-50 opinions on whether I look good on C-SPAN.
1768000	1771000	Senator Sanders, what flavor is your cotton candy here?
1772000	1780000	Look, it's traditional sugar flavored, and this was the result of a freak accident when I was a young man.
1781000	1783000	I saw The Grateful Dead at Brandeis University.
1783000	1798000	And there was some very strong lysergic acid that I sampled at the time, and it altered me, not unlike Peter Parker, sort of superhero,
1799000	1807000	except that my hair turned into cotton candy because it was an outdoor event, and that's what we were eating, and there was sweetness along with LSD.
1808000	1814000	And so it's a debilitating, it's a gift and a curse, you might say, when your hair tastes so good.
1815000	1821000	When you're doing a speech, a 17-hour speech, like I do on a Tuesday, just when I feel like it, it's a humiliating.
1822000	1829000	When another senator, like John McCain, gets up after you and just sort of licks your hair and grabs it and licks it like a goat.
1830000	1834000	That's humiliating. And as president, I would only allow that on Sundays and certain holidays.
1838000	1841000	I'm a little intimidated. This is the largest crowd I've performed for.
1843000	1845000	We've been doing fundraisers around Southern California.
1846000	1848000	I think you've found your people. I'm just a little old.
1849000	1850000	We've got about 40 bucks out of it.
1851000	1856000	I'm sad about how jaded and cynical and kind of disheartened you've already become, and I just met you.
1857000	1858000	I didn't even know there were guys like you out there.
1859000	1862000	I'm the picture of optimism, but I don't believe in irrational optimism.
1863000	1866000	People say you either think the glass is half full or half empty.
1867000	1872000	I believe that the glass can increase year-on-year with targeted investments in certain sectors.
1874000	1881000	That the share of the glass for the bottom 40 percent can be equal to what the share of the glass for the top 10 percent is,
1882000	1886000	using real dollars inflation adjusted back to the original statistics used to degrade the pressure.
1887000	1893000	And if that's not a ringing endorsement of the potential of the American people, I don't know what is.
1895000	1901000	I guess some people just want to hear, you know, like we're going to kick butt overseas and we don't have to be afraid.
1902000	1907000	Look, I'm not a jingoist, but in favor of wars that aren't necessary.
1908000	1912000	If there's any butts that's going to be kicked, they're going to be voluntary butts.
1913000	1916000	They mean people that want us to go to war with them?
1917000	1922000	Look, I think that kicking butt should be like abortion.
1923000	1925000	I think it should be safe, legal and rare.
1926000	1930000	And I think it should involve consenting of both whatever possible.
1931000	1935000	As far as foreign policy, I don't believe we should have one.
1936000	1945000	I think that we should pull all our military forces back and replace it with some brownies that we may be a big sale of some kind in an international scale,
1946000	1948000	which has never been tried anywhere except Norway and look at them.
1951000	1954000	All right, well, I mean, I've never heard.
1955000	1958000	And I am a fan, by the way. I am a fan of the show, the community show.
1959000	1960000	Do you like it, the other community?
1960000	1970000	Yes, I think it's a fantastic look at what we need to be doing for American young people who are in the education system and the burden of student loans that they have to face.
1971000	1974000	Oh, yeah. You don't mean moving to Yahoo, you mean?
1975000	1985000	The top 12% of the middle 6% of the 17, 5% of the, let's say, APR of 11.7% is equal to or greater than.
1985000	1990000	Now, this is an algebra problem. I don't even know the answer to this. I'm just posing it to the people.
1991000	1992000	Given X, what is Y?
1997000	2002000	Carry the one, but the problem is the middle class no longer can carry the one because the two burden carrying the two and the five.
2005000	2007000	All right, Senator Bernie Sanders, everybody.
2008000	2009000	Senator Bernie Sanders.
2010000	2011000	Thank you for coming out.
2012000	2013000	Thank you.
2014000	2015000	Sorry, Mr. Obama.
2016000	2021000	If you want any more, you can go to my website, birdysandas.org forward slash why not Bernie?
2023000	2025000	Bernie Sanders. Thank you, Senator.
2026000	2028000	I didn't like to march. Will you stay, please?
2033000	2034000	Call me an Uber, please.
2039000	2040000	What happened?
2041000	2054000	He and I were talking last week about Herman Cain and Ben Carson. And so when I heard I immediately switched to Ben Carson, so I'd give you a whole Ben Carson because it is in a Domian's wheelhouse to come in.
2055000	2056000	That was James Adomian, everybody. James Adomian.
2059000	2060000	It is well in his wheelhouse.
2063000	2066000	We've never had someone come out and just do a dedicated one off character like that.
2067000	2069000	No, yeah, I don't know if that's what he wanted to do.
2070000	2073000	Do you think you could get Bernie Sanders to come out and play Shadowrun with us?
2074000	2075000	Yeah.
2076000	2078000	Or would there be too much percentage points in the APRs?
2079000	2091000	You could get him to do a lot of that. For example, when I was going on my Ben Carson, Herman Cain run, he, for about an hour straight, was just doing Pat Buchanan to a room of kids who had no idea who the fuck Pat Buchanan was.
2092000	2098000	So much so that afterward I was doing amazing Pat Buchanan impressions to people because I was just copying him.
2099000	2113000	We've had them on before. Aaron and I have talked about how we like his impressions come from a different school of thought, spiritually, kind of, than the rich littles where you just figure out how someone talks and then you kind of repeat.
2114000	2130000	I don't know, he always sympathize with the people that he's mocking. He makes you like them, like they're underdogs and they're the heroes of their own stories.
2131000	2136000	We're fighting position. A thief never knows he's a thief. He always thinks he's doing good work.
2137000	2143000	I love that I can just be at a party and just say, hey, Mark Marin, is it okay if I have these chips and then he does Mark Marin?
2144000	2145000	Or Eddie Papaton.
2146000	2150000	I've got it! My wife is in a vat of blue water.
2151000	2157000	He does the most amazing Eddie Papaton. Two Papaton. There are Papaton shows where he'll heckle him as Papaton.
2157000	2169000	One of these days, maybe, not to be presumptuous, but the most flattering thing in the world would be...
2170000	2172000	To have them heckle you as you?
2173000	2176000	I'm sure the wheels have already started.
2177000	2178000	Dan Harmon impression.
2178000	2179000	The man does not start.
2179000	2185000	He did a good one at one point, was Abed Gaeth, real Abed. He did a pretty good Dan Harmon.
2186000	2194000	He physically becomes everybody. He can't do the impressions necessarily, but he can physically become and do the mannerisms of everybody. It's very shocking.
2195000	2200000	That's kind of how I got to know him. He was at a party and everyone was gathered around in a circle.
2200000	2208000	It was like you made your way through the circle and everyone was just shouting names that this guy was contorting with each name and was on overload.
2209000	2212000	Looking back on it, that may be how we broke him.
2216000	2217000	He was already there.
2218000	2220000	He was an accountant when he walked into that party.
2225000	2229000	I'll never forgive you for that because I introduced him as a Republican. I didn't even know what the hell was going on.
2229000	2234000	I tried to correct him. Once he came in, I was like, what are you doing? He told me. I went, oh, fuck. I can please.
2234000	2236000	So we tried to rewrite it and get the message.
2240000	2243000	That wouldn't have helped. That's exactly the information I had.
2244000	2246000	I just don't know who these people are.
2249000	2255000	Can we talk about the other guy, though? He's a doctor. This is a new tradition in the post-Obama Republican world.
2255000	2263000	There is this effort on the Republican side always, and I shouldn't even say this because I don't want to give them the key to the portal.
2264000	2280000	But they refuse to access people like us our age who are Republicans and have a sense of how to run the internet, how to promote through the web, how to do other things.
2280000	2286000	They really do run off this hierarchy that the elders know better, and they're consistently out of touch.
2287000	2292000	Every run of these campaigns, they focus on, right now, it's because of Obama, it's a black thing.
2292000	2296000	They try to find some sort of minority savior that's going to...
2296000	2302000	And then that's where it goes into fear-mongering, because then they go, okay, what part of the black culture are we going to do appeal to?
2302000	2310000	You look at the way that they gravitated to Herman Cain last time, which is hilarious, because this guy, there was no part of that guy that was serious at any point.
2310000	2314000	And yet, there was a six-week period where he was the leader.
2315000	2319000	He was the guy. They had all eliminated it. Bachman turned out to be a head-spinning freak.
2321000	2326000	Rick Perry did everything he could to blow it, including that moment where he went to Vermont.
2326000	2331000	They gave him a bottle of maple syrup, and he was tripping balls on pills and booze.
2331000	2339000	Maddow wrote nothing for two days. She just played that full tape for two days of him kissing a bottle and then gesturing to women in the audience.
2340000	2343000	He was fucking insane. And so here comes Herman Cain.
2343000	2350000	Keep in mind, at this time, when he finally had to go, his dismount was somebody...
2350000	2355000	He was giving a speech, not about saying goodbye, because he actually never said, I quit.
2355000	2360000	He said, I'm suspending my campaign for the rest of my life.
2361000	2365000	But a person, he's on satellite feed, and somebody's walking around, how you doing, man?
2365000	2371000	And he's sitting there staring into space, because everything that he's done and everything, so you've got to deal with now.
2371000	2375000	And where do you go when you've got six weeks in the spotlight? And now you leap.
2375000	2385000	And he said, a man once asked me if I could be any ice cream, which one would I be?
2386000	2393000	And I said, rocket road, because it has been a rocket road to the president.
2393000	2397000	This is what he said. And this guy was the leading candidate.
2397000	2403000	Now, if he opened with that, if that's how he started off, then we would like that kind of thing.
2404000	2413000	But you said something that distracted me back there a ways, a stretch, as the Republicans say, back there as the crow flies, a yonder.
2414000	2431000	I mean, I know that there is such a thing as the concept of a fiscal Republican that doesn't give a shit about any of this other voodoo that we've come to associate with this tent.
2431000	2442000	But still, don't you think that they've crunched those numbers? Because that would be less work for them if they thought that there were so many young people out there that would just answer the call of pragmatism financially.
2443000	2458000	You implied that maybe you think that, that there's like a tragedy for the Republican Party that they're hung up on this other non-economic crap as if they could somehow get the popular majority in an honest way.
2458000	2473000	All I can talk to you about is this. My contemporaries, who don't agree with me politically, the ones that I get in serious discussions with, where the argument is not about shutting somebody up, about talking louder than somebody,
2473000	2482000	where it's about the actual mathematics of argument and rhetoric, where if you know something that I don't know, we're going to hash this out until I know what you know.
2482000	2487000	But if you don't, shut the fuck up and take my information and move on. These kinds of arguments.
2487000	2493000	Which are based on logic, which we don't teach. We don't teach in public schools. We don't teach logic. We don't teach civics.
2493000	2498000	So you have kids going to public venues and pissing on walls because they don't realize they own a part of that.
2498000	2506000	You have people saying, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, I don't hear you, because they don't understand that that's not an argument.
2506000	2510000	They think that I had an argument with my friend. No, you didn't. You have a discussion about anything.
2510000	2519000	They've been infantilized. They've been limited in terms of how they can see the world.
2519000	2528000	But the ones that I have serious arguments with, those people continue right. They write for Bush.
2528000	2534000	I have friends who are Democrats who actually wrote for Bush, because that was the best job they could take.
2534000	2544000	There's barely any difference between those jobs. I used to write ads for Coke, but fuck, I can only work for Pepsi.
2544000	2554000	What am I going to do? Oh, wait, it's refreshing again. Fuck it. That's always my job.
2554000	2555000	Vote red.
2556000	2561000	I was sitting, sorry. Brought to you by Frito-Lay.
2561000	2566000	But wait, wait, wait. I want to worship. Jeff, Jeff, I want to worship. Finish this thought.
2566000	2567000	Jeff, I want to worship.
2574000	2577000	There's a, but there is a, the mortgage finishes.
2577000	2582000	I wouldn't have done the fifth one. I wouldn't have done.
2582000	2585000	How many comes in fives, man? How many comes in fives?
2585000	2592000	No, these people are my friends. They're all over the place. They're my colleagues and everywhere.
2592000	2598000	But they're tapping in now. They got sidetracked by this Tea Party thing.
2598000	2604000	There's this whole neocon thing of creating enemies and creating arguments where there are no arguments,
2604000	2609000	because you think that your populace is going to vote for you no matter what.
2609000	2614000	And you've got to search out certain areas and own those areas, and it expands and expands and expands.
2614000	2622000	There's a hierarchy to set up that they bought into. It's been going on since the early, mid-70s or whatever.
2622000	2623000	And it stepped up.
2623000	2625000	You and I were born into this, so I don't even know.
2625000	2629000	Yeah, and it stepped up pace when Clinton went in office immediately,
2629000	2637000	where they sort of threw out all of the understanding of how, the things, the graces that you allow the president for better or for worse.
2638000	2642000	I don't think it's panic. It's just hunger. They want their power back.
2642000	2645000	They had power for X amount of years. They did everything that they could.
2645000	2653000	So they just became the other political party because it became a world where you could get elected by, from their perspective,
2653000	2658000	by lumping everyone in that wants hope and change or whatever the rhetoric is for it.
2658000	2667000	So then they became, ironically, this horrible shadow monster that makes the really easy villain because they're constantly lying
2667000	2672000	and engaged in all kinds of open-faced hypocrisy.
2672000	2679000	They sort of have no choice now but to buy into not the younger minds that have a symbolic resonance for it,
2679000	2680000	because they've gotten burned on that now.
2681000	2686000	This woman in South Carolina who was insane that they put in office.
2686000	2691000	So there are these pockets where they pick young people and say, this is our masthead.
2691000	2693000	And then they turn out to be ill-qualified.
2693000	2696000	Well, like these Joe the Plumber guys you mean, or do you mean actual appointments?
2696000	2702000	These are actual people running who they shore up and they end up winning because they look good on the surface
2702000	2704000	and then they don't know what they're doing. They don't know how to legislate.
2704000	2706000	They don't know how to govern immediately.
2706000	2709000	They tell that that's what they thought Barack Obama was.
2709000	2713000	I was paying a little bit of attention this last time because it was a long time ago
2713000	2716000	and I still had something in me that was a little bored.
2716000	2720000	I was getting like drawn in because Barack Obama was so charismatic
2720000	2723000	and the other side was so uncharismatic that it actually made politics,
2723000	2726000	although constantly nauseating as always.
2726000	2728000	I refuse to believe in any of it.
2728000	2733000	But the drama of it I really did enjoy because he really was.
2733000	2737000	I really enjoyed watching him in this sort of Nazarene capacity.
2737000	2743000	Just them throwing all this shit at him.
2743000	2744000	Careful with that.
2744000	2747000	Well, no, I'm not going to be careful because it's not going to be fun.
2747000	2748000	I'm not going to fucking care at all.
2748000	2749000	What do you mean?
2749000	2758000	He was an awesome ninja Christ figure because he did not resort to,
2758000	2765000	he was diplomatic and gentlemanly and classy and humorous
2765000	2770000	and it was fun to watch him win because of his personality.
2770000	2777000	It was fun to watch the bad guys get so angry.
2777000	2779000	There was so much at stake for them.
2779000	2785000	What was not fun, at least for me, is that in the run-up to that,
2785000	2788000	he had to run against or within his own party.
2788000	2793000	At each point that somebody fell challenged by him,
2793000	2795000	people turned.
2795000	2800000	Hillary ran that critical Ohio weekend
2800000	2804000	where she released that red phone ad on Friday,
2804000	2809000	this sort of borderline race-baiting ad
2809000	2814000	with the stock footage of a young white girl in a bed and a phone ringing.
2814000	2818000	A mushroom cloud and then a picture of Bin Laden.
2818000	2820000	This is crazy.
2820000	2827000	The implication was that because she's technically literally been in the White House
2827000	2830000	when that phone rings, she won't go like,
2830000	2832000	Holy fuck, what the fuck?
2832000	2835000	But that's the kind of thing, what they're talking about is like,
2835000	2839000	who do you want to pick up that phone that will have that little white girl
2839000	2841000	sleeping in the room, a black dude?
2842000	2845000	Then they find out, then you find out two weeks later
2845000	2848000	that the girl at stock footage from a Lionel train ad
2848000	2851000	or some sort of train ad, like Amtrak or something,
2851000	2854000	and that the girl as a grown-up doesn't endorse the ad.
2854000	2859000	She actually was working for Obama out of Seattle or someplace in the Northwest.
2859000	2860000	That's awesome.
2860000	2862000	But by that time, the two say it had run,
2862000	2865000	so that primary had been run and he'd already lost that state.
2865000	2869000	And there were these little upturns all the way through.
2870000	2872000	Yeah, it's horrible.
2872000	2873000	What the fuck?
2873000	2874000	Anyway.
2874000	2877000	We all agree, we're not going to vote on this one.
2878000	2881000	I'm not going to say that out loud because there's too many kids listening to me
2881000	2883000	and I don't want to be part of the problem.
2883000	2885000	I just think that the Republican resources are gone.
2885000	2889000	They now realize, and it's going to be interesting when it happens,
2889000	2895000	when they start empowering their informed,
2895000	2901000	their educated youth to really take control of that campaign.
2901000	2904000	And the elders stop this sort of shit that we can all see
2904000	2906000	because even their own constituency now
2906000	2910000	can see this sort of baiting and weirdness that's going on.
2910000	2911000	I checked out.
2911000	2915000	It was so long ago, it was that big election.
2915000	2916000	I voted since then.
2916000	2917000	I voted for Obama.
2917000	2919000	I was just like, I never want to be that guy.
2919000	2923000	There's such a terrifying fucking terrorism.
2924000	2925000	It was like this non-vote.
2925000	2926000	You didn't vote?
2926000	2929000	You're a fucking U-AIDS, cancer, asshole, fuckface.
2933000	2937000	So I do turn out because I just want to say, I want to be able to go,
2937000	2940000	yeah, I did and I also don't give a shit.
2941000	2944000	But when I really checked out spiritually and mentally.
2944000	2946000	The way it is at this time, vote Bernie Sanders.
2946000	2947000	Right.
2947000	2949000	Well, I wish people would vote.
2949000	2951000	I voted and I don't give a shit.
2951000	2952000	Vote their conscience.
2952000	2955000	I don't even know if that guy really exists.
2956000	2958000	But I like his style.
2958000	2961000	You're the top 1% of the bottom 45%.
2961000	2963000	He's certainly singing my tune.
2963000	2965000	There's always one guy early on that's like,
2965000	2968000	hey, I'm Mr. Elfman from the trees.
2968000	2970000	And it's like a big joke.
2970000	2972000	But we always know at the bottom of it all,
2972000	2977000	it's like for instance, oh, yeah, God forbid an atheist Jewish socialist
2977000	2981000	become the president because they'd care more about their country than their church.
2981000	2987000	They'd believe in equality financially and they'd take their job very seriously.
2987000	2991000	Like, oh, no, the stereotypes associated with these groups.
2993000	2996000	A Jewish atheist? Oh, God.
2996000	2997000	But I don't know if that guy is.
2997000	2999000	I don't know what if James was making up.
2999000	3000000	I don't know if that guy exists or not.
3000000	3001000	Yeah, he does.
3001000	3002000	He's real.
3003000	3006000	My father is a conservative and we don't really talk politics,
3006000	3008000	but he's not a dummy.
3008000	3011000	He's not a Rush Limbaugh, lunatic, you know,
3011000	3015000	as far as I'm concerned when people are party-lined right wingers.
3015000	3017000	Also, I think I don't like liberals much either.
3017000	3018000	I don't really like it.
3018000	3021000	Anyway, there's no good politics for me.
3022000	3026000	The idea that anybody thinks that they know how everybody also has to operate
3026000	3028000	is fucking insanity or dim-witted.
3028000	3030000	So I think it's foolish to say like,
3030000	3032000	all conservatives are out of their mind
3032000	3035000	or all liberals are just a bunch of fucking dickheads.
3035000	3036000	But that's how people think.
3036000	3041000	And the idea that there's these two polar opposites duking it out in a ring
3041000	3042000	is nuts.
3042000	3044000	They're so close to each other ideologically.
3044000	3047000	And then we create stupid things to argue about
3047000	3048000	that really have nothing to do with anything.
3048000	3050000	We make a big argument.
3050000	3052000	And the right wing right now seems to have made, as somebody said,
3052000	3054000	a constituency out of crazy.
3054000	3058000	And there is a huge amount of crazy people that will vote for crazy shit.
3058000	3059000	Do you think it'll be different?
3059000	3060000	I'm sorry.
3060000	3061000	Just to finish my point.
3062000	3066000	I was at Seattle Tacoma Airport today at the Anthony's Fish Place
3066000	3068000	having a Bloody Mary before I got my plane.
3068000	3071000	And I was reading my book, and there was a guy next to me,
3071000	3074000	and I put it on my Instagram, a little video of him.
3074000	3079000	He was burping and farting and grunting and just making every goddamn thing.
3079000	3081000	He was farting all over me.
3086000	3089000	And also, bar tap, which is my least favorite thing.
3089000	3093000	And this guy was like 55, maybe 58-ish.
3093000	3096000	And bar tappers drive me up the fucking tree.
3096000	3099000	And he was a one-man band of just bumming me out.
3101000	3105000	And I finally moved a stool over when he finally farted a fog around me
3105000	3107000	and my Bloody Mary, and I moved around.
3107000	3108000	I moved his seat away.
3108000	3110000	And I don't think he liked that much.
3110000	3112000	Then he kind of was engaging everybody like,
3112000	3113000	oh, you got a Boston shirt on.
3113000	3114000	He had a Southern accent.
3114000	3116000	And he really did sound like it.
3116000	3117000	He said, you got a Boston shirt.
3117000	3120000	So what do you think about that Tom Brady verdict?
3120000	3121000	Blah, blah, blah.
3121000	3124000	And the guy's like, I'm a Boston fan.
3124000	3125000	I thought it was fair.
3125000	3127000	And the guy goes, ah, blah, blah.
3127000	3130000	The bartender's like, I got to get out of here.
3130000	3132000	And the bartender closed him out.
3132000	3136000	And he announced to the bartender, I'll do it as loud as he did it.
3136000	3138000	And the bartender was two and a half feet from him.
3138000	3140000	And he announced this for you.
3140000	3143000	The room, Harman Town, you would all have heard this at the bar.
3143000	3145000	And there's music playing, and it's an airport.
3145000	3146000	And there's a band playing over there.
3146000	3149000	And he goes, well, I don't like y'all's politics,
3149000	3151000	but them oysters was delicious.
3159000	3161000	And I'm sitting right next to him like, you've got to be.
3161000	3162000	A political mastermind.
3162000	3163000	Yeah.
3163000	3164000	And so the bartender, without a beat,
3164000	3166000	and I don't know that he was gay,
3166000	3170000	but he had that kind of polish to him that maybe he was.
3170000	3173000	He wasn't like a gruff jockey, never going to be gay guy.
3173000	3178000	He goes, you know, Jackson can't be gay, right?
3178000	3181000	You know, you can't be gay if you're in sports?
3181000	3182000	You guys know that?
3182000	3186000	But he goes, what politics are those?
3186000	3189000	And this guy's like, you know, maybe early 40s.
3189000	3194000	And he goes, I just mean, you know, around here, it's like around where?
3194000	3197000	And the guy's like, do you mean like in Seattle?
3197000	3202000	Well, you know, you guys, and he's like, what's your point?
3203000	3205000	And he goes, just give me the signs of Bill,
3205000	3208000	and leaves the guy a hundred dollar bill.
3211000	3213000	Because he really just meant the oysters were good.
3213000	3214000	They were that good.
3214000	3218000	He wasn't going to stand around Seattle and not leave a parting shot
3218000	3220000	and say like, you guys are all a bunch of like,
3220000	3223000	women love and fag kissing, fudge a bunch of weirdos.
3223000	3226000	Rootin' tootin'.
3226000	3227000	Or the opposite of rootin' tootin'.
3227000	3228000	No, you guys never rooted or tootin'.
3228000	3229000	No, I'm rootin' tootin'.
3229000	3230000	Yes.
3231000	3234000	You guys are Vladimir Putin.
3236000	3237000	Right, buddy?
3237000	3238000	You know what I'm talking about.
3238000	3239000	Anatoly.
3239000	3240000	Anatoly knows what I'm talking about.
3240000	3241000	Anatoly knows exactly what he's talking about.
3241000	3243000	That's a little inside joke for our Russian friend.
3243000	3246000	But the thing is like, what bummed me out is like,
3246000	3249000	we can't just go around hating 50% or whatever the, you know,
3249000	3251000	the populace of people that are the voters are like,
3251000	3254000	like we can't all be right and we can't all be wrong.
3254000	3257000	It's like, it's just the idea that we've been polarizing is too.
3257000	3258000	Yeah, it's silly.
3259000	3262000	We've been barking that at them for three years of this podcast.
3262000	3265000	And you and I have been barking it for, since we were their age.
3265000	3274000	But what I wonder is, now that the country is arguably in jeopardy,
3274000	3277000	or maybe as, you know, because it's been arguably,
3277000	3282000	it's been supposedly in jeopardy since way before I was born.
3282000	3287000	I mean, it was in jeopardy because we were fighting Anatoly's grandparents.
3287000	3290000	And we, it turns out that was a fucking Wizard of Oz,
3290000	3291000	if there ever was one.
3293000	3295000	If ever there was a wizard, there was a wizard.
3295000	3298000	There's always by the side, like, oh God,
3298000	3300000	the Chinese are buying everything.
3300000	3303000	The Japanese, oh, we owe the France so much money.
3303000	3305000	Like, I don't, so I can't tell.
3305000	3308000	I feel like because I'm 42, I kind of get the sense
3308000	3312000	that actually we are crumbling now.
3312000	3321000	But if we are, maybe will we now see maybe three political parties?
3321000	3323000	Maybe four?
3323000	3326000	Like major ones, like big ones?
3326000	3329000	Because there's maybe four ways to think about the future?
3329000	3333000	How about 50 and 70 other countries that have high IQs?
3333000	3335000	The history of our country, when we were forming it,
3335000	3339000	and there were a thousand ways to commit treason
3339000	3342000	against the British crown, you know,
3342000	3345000	and there were like a lot of fucking ways to think about it.
3345000	3348000	Yeah, now it's just like, isn't it just a sign of absolute luxury
3348000	3352000	that we've gone into like, are you a lefty or a righty?
3356000	3358000	Aren't we just sort of sucking our thumb and kind of like?
3358000	3361000	I think it's, the main thing for me, on a style standpoint,
3361000	3364000	if you just look at America in terms of like if it was a person,
3364000	3366000	would you want to hang out with that person?
3366000	3368000	The answer is fucking no way.
3368000	3370000	You would never hang out with America at a party.
3370000	3374000	You would fucking absolutely be hanging out in fucking like Norway.
3374000	3376000	You know, like your friends would be other people.
3376000	3378000	I'm kind of fascinated with this concept
3378000	3381000	because it all depends on whether you're inside or outside this black box.
3381000	3383000	So like if you're inside of it,
3383000	3385000	my new thing is I just call it King's Landing.
3385000	3391000	Like it's kind of cool in here unless you're like super poor.
3391000	3394000	So you see they go on a little tour through King's Landing
3394000	3398000	and there's a lot of people going like, my arm hurts.
3399000	3402000	Horror, horror, horror.
3402000	3404000	Bastard.
3404000	3406000	Like they're on the edge and they're on the verge.
3406000	3409000	But like there's, you know, like we're hanging out
3409000	3411000	and we're like trying, I don't know,
3411000	3414000	there's a concept inside the box called America
3414000	3417000	that everything could be super cool.
3417000	3419000	But like yeah, if you zoom out
3419000	3421000	and look at its relationship with the planet,
3421000	3424000	then definitely you don't want to hang out with that guy at a party.
3424000	3427000	It's a guy with a baseball hat on backwards and a tribal tattoo.
3427000	3428000	Yeah.
3428000	3430000	But he won't even be nailed down about that.
3430000	3432000	And if you go up to him and say,
3432000	3436000	hey, I noticed your baseball cap and your tribal tattoo,
3436000	3438000	I take that to mean you'd like accourers,
3438000	3440000	he might go, fuck you, you jerk.
3440000	3443000	You broke ass piss of shit.
3443000	3444000	What?
3444000	3446000	Piss of shit?
3446000	3448000	And you'd be like, what?
3448000	3450000	And he's like, I'm fancy.
3452000	3455000	I'm backwards cap, tribal tattoo, fancy pants.
3456000	3461000	Wait, but I thought, yeah, well, you don't get paid to think, Germany.
3463000	3467000	Keep making my Volkswagens, brah.
3468000	3470000	Yeah, you wouldn't hang out with that guy.
3470000	3472000	No, you would not hang out with that guy.
3472000	3479000	Because America, if America like went to like out for the evening,
3479000	3482000	America would not go to the opera or to the theater.
3482000	3484000	I like this game.
3484000	3488000	It would absolutely be in the second row of a UFC fight.
3488000	3490000	That's where America went to fight.
3490000	3492000	I think that's too simple.
3492000	3495000	That kind of thinking is what gets people like George Bush elected
3495000	3497000	if he can convince you he's from Texas.
3497000	3500000	It's like, oh, we're just simple folk.
3500000	3503000	We just like populism and like popular stuff.
3503000	3506000	And if it makes sense, like crushing a bro with a brew,
3506000	3508000	or sometimes the other way around.
3509000	3510000	Or pissing a shit.
3510000	3516000	There's a scheming, like there's an underhandedness to it, too.
3516000	3518000	There's all this snootery and charcuterie.
3521000	3523000	Gladden putery.
3524000	3530000	We're nouveau riche and we're a trailer park beach.
3532000	3534000	We're the end of the Roman Republic.
3534000	3537000	It's exactly ancient Rome, man.
3537000	3538000	I mean, let's not root for it.
3538000	3541000	I live in a big house on a big hill.
3542000	3544000	I just keep hoping it's steep enough.
3544000	3547000	Every time I climb it and I'm out of breath,
3547000	3550000	I hope the same thing is happening to poor people right now.
3553000	3557000	Because if I keep getting fatter and they keep getting thinner,
3557000	3560000	this is going to make a fun climb for them.
3560000	3562000	And I'm going to be halfway up,
3563000	3565000	like eating a cheeseburger.
3566000	3568000	The poor people in America are pretty fat, too.
3568000	3569000	Right.
3569000	3570000	And that's a good sign.
3571000	3572000	And the two parties.
3572000	3575000	The fact that everyone's a big fat baby that's going like,
3575000	3576000	are you this or are you that,
3576000	3579000	means that things haven't even begun to go down yet.
3579000	3580000	That's my question.
3580000	3582000	It's like, shit's going to go down.
3583000	3586000	I'm not one of these people that loves panicking everybody.
3588000	3591000	People talk about super volcanoes and avian flu and Ebola
3592000	3595000	or even have political panic buttons and stuff like that.
3595000	3597000	It's like, are you fucking kidding me?
3597000	3600000	Do you really think that that is the thing that's going to happen?
3601000	3607000	If tomorrow the dollar was worth a penny instead of a dollar,
3607000	3609000	which isn't that big a difference.
3610000	3613000	If tomorrow you woke up and the dollar was worth a penny,
3613000	3618000	you'd have about six hours before your week would be different.
3619000	3622000	It wouldn't, you would be like,
3622000	3624000	shit would be immediately all over the,
3624000	3628000	everybody would like, everything would be fucked up.
3628000	3633000	Six hours and like, you wouldn't be able to call people.
3633000	3635000	Things would be, it would be Armageddon
3635000	3637000	just because we'd think it was Armageddon.
3637000	3638000	Because what the fuck is the dollar
3638000	3640000	except our gift certificate to ourselves
3640000	3642000	for an ice cream we're never going to get.
3644000	3646000	And as soon as it says, we lick it
3646000	3648000	and there's no ice cream flavor on it,
3648000	3653000	we're going to flip a shit bird if that's an expression.
3654000	3657000	Over the last four minutes, you've coined some doozies.
3657000	3660000	Well, you better start making up new languages now
3660000	3663000	because each sector is going to have their own.
3663000	3664000	I'll tell you.
3664000	3666000	You're not going to go into the free fire zone.
3666000	3669000	They're all going to be speaking an amalgam of Chinese and Mexican.
3670000	3676000	That means I'm holding a thermonuclear hand grenade.
3678000	3681000	You've got me terrified, and I'm a pretty easygoing guy.
3681000	3683000	You've got me terrified the moment a dollar is worth a penny
3683000	3686000	that people will start crushing bros with brews.
3689000	3691000	Right now we crush brews with bros.
3691000	3692000	Right.
3692000	3695000	That can flip like the magnetic polarity of the earth.
3696000	3698000	Imagine a world where you crush bros.
3698000	3700000	Apparently we can start pissing a shit.
3700000	3701000	Yeah.
3701000	3702000	I don't know.
3702000	3704000	What is it with me tonight?
3704000	3708000	I think I drank myself in New York into oblivion like,
3708000	3709000	oh, really, Dan?
3709000	3711000	Tell us about it.
3711000	3712000	Why?
3712000	3713000	How?
3713000	3714000	How did that happen?
3714000	3717000	Was someone getting married?
3718000	3721000	I think I pinched a nerve.
3721000	3724000	I scheduled a doctor's appointment, but every once in a while,
3724000	3726000	I'm like, yeah, my pinky's a little numb.
3727000	3729000	I think I drank myself to death,
3729000	3731000	and we're just living out the final hours.
3733000	3737000	It's possible, and I'm okay with it.
3738000	3740000	I wanted to have kids, but...
3744000	3745000	After New York, that ship has sailed?
3745000	3746000	Well, no, no.
3746000	3748000	I'm just saying, it's just becoming increasingly like,
3748000	3751000	I'm getting that feeling of like,
3751000	3754000	well, either your kid's going to be John Connor,
3754000	3758000	or he's going to be one of those skulls.
3761000	3765000	To put it in Strictly Terminator 2 terms.
3769000	3772000	Just to use that movie as an example.
3772000	3774000	So what are the odds that my kid's going to...
3774000	3777000	And pretty high that my kid would be John Connor.
3777000	3778000	I agree.
3778000	3779000	You don't have to say.
3779000	3783000	If anyone was going to raise the hope of society in Los Angeles,
3783000	3785000	yeah, I do think it would be me.
3785000	3786000	I do.
3786000	3788000	But I don't know if he'd get the message in time.
3788000	3789000	I don't know.
3789000	3790000	He'd be looking at me and going,
3790000	3792000	so why are robots bad?
3792000	3796000	This guy seems to jerk off to laptops a lot.
3799000	3801000	He really loves playing Minecraft.
3801000	3802000	Why would my son...
3802000	3805000	I need to get my shit together and have a baby
3805000	3807000	so that I can teach him jujitsu.
3808000	3811000	And I just have so much Minecraft to play.
3812000	3818000	I guess my point is if I were to get so drunk that I died
3818000	3821000	before I had a baby...
3824000	3827000	You might have doomed us to a terrible apocalypse.
3827000	3829000	No, no, to someone else I'll have John Connor.
3829000	3831000	It's 9-11, by the way.
3835000	3838000	It took us a few years, but we're cheering for 9-11.
3839000	3842000	We didn't think that was going to happen in the weeks following...
3842000	3844000	Tragedy plus time.
3845000	3848000	Think about it, with the six months of those buildings falling
3848000	3850000	and all those people dying, how...
3850000	3852000	Thanks for bringing it back to that.
3852000	3854000	If somebody said to you, Dan,
3854000	3857000	Dan, you and Jeff and Davis are going to be on stage doing a podcast,
3857000	3859000	and when you point to a clock and say it's 9-11,
3859000	3861000	the whole crowd will cheer.
3861000	3863000	What year do you think that will be?
3863000	3864000	I don't know.
3864000	3865000	You might as well...
3865000	3867000	You're making me feel like I'm...
3867000	3870000	The joke is about the number having significance.
3870000	3875000	You're tying it to the corpses and the rubble, and I'm out.
3879000	3882000	It is terrible when people die all the time.
3883000	3885000	It always will be.
3885000	3888000	But the number being important is funny.
3889000	3891000	It's weird, though.
3891000	3893000	And again, I talked to Professor Brian Cox,
3893000	3895000	and he says it's all just coincidence.
3895000	3899000	I've been looking at my clock, and all the time now, it's 9-10.
3900000	3901000	Really?
3901000	3903000	Yeah. So maybe I'm going back in time.
3905000	3907000	We did have a controversy...
3907000	3908000	Wait, what a controversy.
3908000	3910000	Now I'm Helen Slater.
3910000	3912000	How drunk are you right now, 1-10?
3912000	3913000	This is my...
3913000	3915000	Well, I've filled it up a couple times
3915000	3920000	when the lines between political satire and my ignorance
3920000	3924000	were so blurred that life was a teardrop.
3925000	3927000	I did fill this a couple times, but...
3927000	3929000	Actually, when you drink...
3929000	3931000	You can drink a lot of vodka and still be very articulate.
3931000	3932000	Thank you.
3935000	3936000	That's the problem.
3936000	3942000	In Portland and New York, those towns are my towns, baby.
3943000	3945000	I drank a lot.
3945000	3946000	Did you hang out with Dino and get it on with him?
3946000	3948000	Yep. I did it all.
3948000	3949000	I did it all.
3949000	3951000	My definition of it all.
3951000	3953000	I hung out at a lot of bars
3953000	3956000	and had a lot of fun conversations with a lot of wonderful people.
3956000	3958000	New York is very friendly.
3958000	3959000	I don't know...
3959000	3960000	Now it seems like that's the gimmick.
3960000	3961000	I think that's just Dino's New York.
3961000	3964000	Dino knows how to take you through New York,
3964000	3967000	and it becomes this magical, wonderful place
3967000	3969000	where you're just walking into these creepy places
3969000	3971000	and everyone is so happy.
3971000	3973000	I think that's just New York.
3973000	3974000	That's just my...
3975000	3979000	Maybe you're Dino and maybe I'm the odd man out,
3979000	3983000	but I was always so intimidated by that city.
3983000	3986000	I always felt like it was so hustle and bustle
3986000	3989000	and you're in the way.
3989000	3993000	It's all about practicality and more insectoid.
3993000	3996000	Now when I go there,
3996000	3999000	it's like this honeycomb of dive bars.
3999000	4001000	Everyone's just kind of like...
4001000	4003000	They know you're from out of town,
4003000	4005000	but they don't care and they're happy to...
4005000	4006000	Where did you go?
4006000	4008000	Do you remember Radio City Music Hall?
4008000	4013000	They have this lounge in the...
4013000	4015000	They'll talk to you.
4015000	4018000	And there was a lady there that kicks for a living.
4022000	4024000	And only at Christmas.
4024000	4026000	What a city.
4027000	4029000	Why would they attack that town?
4034000	4039000	See, you guys feel how I feel when you bring it to the actual...
4039000	4041000	Yeah.
4041000	4043000	Boo him.
4043000	4045000	You were booing him.
4045000	4047000	Good.
4047000	4049000	They were booing you.
4050000	4052000	No, they weren't.
4052000	4054000	I just...
4054000	4059000	One little tiny little cinnamon hot apple
4059000	4061000	from the apple pie of New York
4061000	4063000	that is largely a blurb.
4063000	4065000	It was so fun.
4065000	4068000	Like sitting at a bar with Dino
4068000	4072000	and this guy came out of the back room
4072000	4074000	and he was wearing this...
4074000	4078000	He was eight feet tall and...
4078000	4080000	I guess if you...
4080000	4083000	Certainly I wouldn't describe him this way if he were present,
4083000	4088000	but it seemed like his head was too small for his giant body.
4088000	4093000	And he had this sports jersey on
4093000	4096000	like a muscle shirt
4096000	4098000	and kind of like...
4098000	4100000	I don't know, he just had this big giant arms
4100000	4102000	and this little tiny head
4102000	4104000	and he was just coming out of the back room
4104000	4106000	and he had this furrowed brow
4106000	4110000	and was looking for his wallet as he's heading out of the bar
4110000	4113000	and Dino was in the middle of talking to people
4113000	4114000	and he was like,
4114000	4116000	oh sorry everybody, hold on.
4116000	4118000	The guy I paid to beat the shit out of me is here.
4118000	4122000	And we just all looked at the guy
4122000	4124000	and we started laughing because it really looked like
4124000	4126000	this guy was like...
4126000	4128000	His job is to beat you up and we were like,
4128000	4130000	yeah, it's funny, it does look like you're...
4130000	4132000	And he's like, what, what?
4132000	4134000	It looks like you beat people up for a living.
4134000	4136000	He's like, I do, I'm a professional boxer.
4136000	4140000	Why does everybody react to me that way?
4140000	4142000	And I was like, aww.
4142000	4144000	And he sat down and was like, let us buy you a drink.
4144000	4146000	He's like, I don't drink, look at me.
4146000	4148000	And it was like...
4148000	4150000	But he had this really thick accent
4150000	4154000	and he spent the five minutes
4154000	4156000	because I was like, can I get you a power bar?
4156000	4160000	It's like reverse bullying this guy, but loving him.
4160000	4164000	And he's like, no seriously, it's like fucking weird.
4164000	4166000	I don't choose this.
4166000	4170000	Every year it's like my arms keep getting bigger.
4170000	4174000	And we're just dying laughing
4174000	4176000	because we're like...
4176000	4178000	Because we're dying and we're laughing.
4178000	4180000	This is like a young big strong guy who's like,
4180000	4184000	someone get me out of this body.
4184000	4186000	It's such a...
4186000	4189000	I don't see that happening in other cities.
4189000	4193000	It's just like, I gotta go to the gym now and beat up more people.
4193000	4197000	It's all I can do.
4197000	4199000	I feel like New York is really good.
4199000	4201000	They make eye contact, they flirt and bars
4201000	4203000	and people talk to each other.
4203000	4205000	There's a lot more stranger interaction, I've found.
4205000	4207000	And from people I know that have lived there,
4207000	4210000	they say, yeah, that's very appealing and that's great.
4210000	4212000	But the relationships don't really...
4212000	4216000	They're very good at short kind of superficial,
4216000	4220000	like short quick fix relationships and hangouts.
4220000	4222000	There's a lot of that going on,
4222000	4225000	but dating is very hard out there and stuff like that.
4225000	4228000	It's very transient out there because there's so much going on.
4228000	4230000	I don't know if that's true or not,
4230000	4232000	but maybe we have some New Yorkers here that agree or disagree.
4232000	4234000	Yeah?
4234000	4236000	Everybody's just very busy all the time
4236000	4238000	and everything's just kind of moving
4238000	4241000	so it's hard to keep track of people over a long period of time.
4241000	4244000	People also exit the city at different points
4244000	4246000	so you might be dating somebody like, you know what,
4246000	4248000	it's time for me to get out of here.
4248000	4254000	You've been part of a sort of cutting I've been doing.
4254000	4257000	And now it's time to heal up and go to Oregon.
4257000	4260000	There was once, I went back years ago,
4260000	4263000	I went back for, I think it was like the last,
4263000	4265000	before Christmas, the last showing of SNL.
4265000	4267000	It was a whole week where we were all back.
4267000	4270000	And Josh Fadim was there and James Adomian might have been there.
4270000	4272000	I think Derek Waters was there.
4272000	4274000	Jonah Ray was there.
4274000	4277000	All these people from LA just happened to be in town at the same time
4277000	4279000	and there was a Friday night where we all agreed
4279000	4281000	that we were going to meet at one bar
4281000	4283000	and then from there go to another friend of mine,
4283000	4287000	a bar that was near a friend of mine in Brooklyn.
4287000	4291000	So we set up this bar and a bunch of great stuff happened leading up to this.
4291000	4294000	So it was already a good night and we get to this bar
4294000	4296000	and it's sort of a yuppie bar on Delancey Street
4296000	4298000	and we're just hanging out.
4298000	4301000	And I'd been there before so I thought it was a good hangout
4301000	4308000	and right around 1130, quarter to 12,
4308000	4312000	people started coming in and going downstairs in the same bar
4312000	4315000	but these people were wrapped in vinyl.
4315000	4320000	One person was leading another person in on all fours
4320000	4322000	and I remember at some point Fadim goes,
4322000	4323000	where are they going?
4323000	4325000	And I go, oh there's another grape bar downstairs
4325000	4326000	because I remembered in that moment.
4326000	4328000	Oh yeah, Friday night there's a dungeon downstairs.
4328000	4329000	Was it lit?
4329000	4330000	Was it lit?
4330000	4333000	No, I think it might even be Delancey Street bar.
4333000	4334000	Delancey?
4334000	4335000	Yeah, the Delancey.
4335000	4336000	Wow, I think it's got nothing.
4336000	4344000	So I said, I go, Josh, it's a great bar downstairs.
4344000	4345000	You should go check it out.
4345000	4348000	And Josh went downstairs and then didn't come back
4348000	4351000	for like an hour.
4351000	4355000	And he came back and he's like, what's going on?
4355000	4357000	It was just a museum of chaos.
4357000	4359000	I had these friends that told me years ago, long time ago,
4359000	4361000	like 12 years ago, 15 years ago,
4361000	4363000	to meet us at a bar in Hollywood
4363000	4364000	that I don't think is there anymore.
4364000	4367000	It's near where Borden's is and it was like it's changed.
4367000	4368000	I think it's next door to Borden's.
4368000	4370000	It used to be like kind of like a leather club
4370000	4372000	or I don't know what that was.
4372000	4373000	But it wasn't that bar.
4373000	4374000	It was near that place.
4374000	4376000	And they go, meet us at this bar and we'll all meet up there
4376000	4378000	and then we'll all go to this other thing.
4378000	4382000	It's kind of like a sexy like S&M-y kind of themed bar.
4382000	4383000	Like fine.
4383000	4386000	So we go in there and it wasn't just S&M themed.
4386000	4388000	It was fucking on.
4388000	4391000	And there was a guy that I would say, you know,
4391000	4395000	30-year-old, 28-year-old guy on a sawhorse,
4395000	4397000	like strapped down to like all the legs,
4397000	4399000	like arms and legs strapped down, laying across,
4399000	4402000	totally naked and no eye protection.
4402000	4408000	And there was a couple women like working on him with whips
4408000	4410000	and like car batteries and whatnot.
4410000	4418000	And then out of his asshole was half of a very large hammer.
4418000	4421000	Well, you could tell by the end of it, there's a claw hammer.
4421000	4423000	And by the size of the head of the hammer
4423000	4426000	and only about maybe five inches of it like out,
4426000	4429000	like there's eight or nine or ten inches of a hammer up that guy's butt.
4429000	4431000	Wait, what do you, okay, hold on.
4431000	4436000	So the important thing to me is that the head of the hammer
4436000	4437000	was what you were looking at.
4437000	4438000	Okay.
4438000	4439000	Because you were like, it's a claw hammer
4439000	4443000	and you could tell from the, it was like, what was in the,
4443000	4445000	I don't know, and you brought me around to a place like,
4445000	4447000	okay, so the handle of the hammer is up his ass.
4447000	4448000	It's a big deal.
4448000	4449000	So we sat there drinking and like,
4449000	4453000	this guy was getting the fucking four multi-man.
4453000	4456000	People have been drinking, this guy's got a hammer in his butt.
4456000	4458000	Yeah.
4458000	4460000	Table five needs bread.
4465000	4469000	I had nothing to say so.
4469000	4472000	Clean, clean up in aisle three.
4472000	4474000	How do you know when you're finished?
4474000	4475000	How do you know when you're finished?
4475000	4476000	How do you know when you're finished?
4476000	4478000	When you have a hammer up your ass.
4478000	4479000	How do you know when you're finished?
4479000	4481000	Like, when does that guy go, got it.
4481000	4483000	That's it.
4483000	4485000	Thank you, ladies.
4485000	4487000	Tabitha, Samantha.
4487000	4489000	And then he, same time next week.
4489000	4493000	He walks out and they're like, oh shit, our hammer.
4493000	4496000	I mean, we lose more hammers that way.
4496000	4498000	The fascinating thing about that stuff is like when Dino,
4498000	4501000	when Dino has experiences, there is a,
4501000	4505000	I think it's okay for me to say this without drawing like,
4506000	4509000	either jeers or cocked eyebrows or anything,
4509000	4510000	because I think that,
4510000	4512000	I assume that's what that Fifty Shades of Grey business is,
4512000	4515000	is our increasing awareness that we are a little jealous of,
4515000	4518000	of people who are able to have heightened, like,
4518000	4520000	and I think if you're a human being like,
4520000	4522000	like heightened sexuality,
4522000	4526000	if that does involve like crazy shit that we would look at as being
4526000	4529000	way distant from prom night,
4529000	4533000	like that, it's like almost like, well, yeah,
4533000	4536000	because like wolves can do prom night.
4536000	4538000	It's like, I'm a wolf and I haven't had sex yet.
4538000	4540000	And the female wolf's like, me neither.
4540000	4541000	So here we go.
4541000	4542000	Okay, we're done.
4542000	4543000	Oh, you got pregnant.
4543000	4546000	Let's have more normal wolves.
4546000	4550000	Like whereas there are some people out there that are like,
4550000	4553000	you know, and the internet has made them more able to do it through
4553000	4556000	with control and safety and like, while still,
4556000	4557000	like, I don't know,
4557000	4560000	they just have this whole fucking like network and crazy.
4560000	4565000	And I swear, like, it's not going to work for me.
4565000	4567000	I'm going to my grave very happily,
4567000	4571000	like kissing Aaron and like sometimes coming and like making a baby
4571000	4573000	and then like, I'm going to tell him do the same thing,
4573000	4574000	but if he doesn't, fine.
4574000	4582000	Like, but like, I do see the nobility like are the,
4582000	4585000	I definitely don't look down on it when people are like,
4585000	4590000	like, like the Dino, like he has adventures like he has like,
4590000	4594000	like he, like he tells one person this thing and then he tells them
4594000	4597000	and they make agreements like you're going to meet her in the,
4597000	4598000	in the hotel bar.
4598000	4600000	He lied to a dominatrix.
4600000	4601000	Did he tell the story on the show?
4601000	4602000	Yeah, he did.
4602000	4603000	I don't know.
4603000	4604000	You know, there's like the dishonesty thing,
4604000	4606000	but I'm talking about like the,
4606000	4608000	I'm talking about like the role playing thing where it's like,
4608000	4610000	you could agree in advance and you can go like,
4610000	4614000	like he did this thing in New York where he had one person,
4614000	4616000	he had one person that he knew from,
4616000	4619000	from one part of the world and another person and they were,
4619000	4623000	one was a Dom and one was a sub and he told them like,
4623000	4624000	like he was explaining to me over drinks.
4624000	4625000	He's like, here's what I did.
4625000	4629000	I told them, I gave him my hotel room keys and I told them,
4629000	4630000	you're going to,
4630000	4631000	I'm going to go to this adult swim thing.
4631000	4633000	You guys are going to meet in my hotel room.
4633000	4634000	They've never met before.
4634000	4638000	You guys powwow about whatever you want to do to me when I get back to
4638000	4639000	the room.
4639000	4640000	I don't know.
4640000	4641000	I don't know how you're going to interact with each other or what
4641000	4642000	you're going to do.
4642000	4643000	You know,
4643000	4645000	it's just like going to go have dinner, hang out.
4645000	4649000	And then while I went to the upfronts and learned about marketing and
4649000	4653000	demographics and watched a Miley Cyrus performance,
4653000	4654000	do you know,
4654000	4656000	went back to his hotel room where two women,
4656000	4660000	you know had agreed to do secret things to,
4660000	4661000	to, to,
4661000	4662000	to his body that were like,
4662000	4663000	he didn't know if he was going to,
4663000	4664000	when he was going to walk in there,
4664000	4669000	if he was going to be attacked and told that he was a pig and tied up and
4669000	4670000	blah, blah, blah,
4670000	4671000	blah, blah.
4671000	4673000	Or if he was going to walk in and one woman was going to have the other
4673000	4675000	women's woven in a web and hanging from like,
4675000	4678000	in a Lord of the rings cocoon,
4678000	4679000	you know, like,
4679000	4680000	and go like,
4680000	4681000	like she's in there,
4681000	4682000	but like,
4682000	4683000	like he didn't know.
4683000	4684000	And so,
4684000	4685000	and then I,
4685000	4686000	and I never,
4686000	4687000	I never asked him cause I didn't really,
4687000	4688000	that,
4688000	4690000	that stuff I was fascinated with like the preparatory period.
4690000	4692000	And then the next day I saw him and it was like,
4692000	4693000	how'd it go?
4693000	4694000	And he was like,
4694000	4695000	it was great.
4695000	4696000	Like,
4696000	4697000	but he knew going into it that it could have been a disaster.
4697000	4698000	That's the other weird thing.
4698000	4702000	It was like the acceptance of like part of our mythology of sex is like,
4702000	4703000	oh,
4703000	4707000	it's supposed to always be good.
4707000	4708000	Like,
4708000	4711000	like it's like dessert when like,
4711000	4715000	like actually it's like an intermingling of the human animal,
4715000	4716000	you know?
4716000	4717000	And like,
4717000	4718000	I it's like that,
4718000	4719000	that,
4719000	4724000	that idea that certs commercial idea that romance equals sex equals
4724000	4727000	always infatuated equals all that stuff.
4727000	4728000	That,
4728000	4732000	that could be responsible for a very high divorce rate because you look across
4732000	4737000	the table at breakfast at this person that you haven't felt animalistic about
4737000	4738000	in 10 years.
4738000	4741000	And why should you out of respect to her feel that way?
4741000	4742000	And now all of a sudden,
4742000	4745000	because you saw a stupid rom-com the other night,
4745000	4747000	you think that means you're not in love with her,
4747000	4748000	which isn't true.
4748000	4749000	You know,
4749000	4753000	there just might need to be communication about what makes your little wee wee,
4753000	4754000	uh,
4755000	4756000	dance around and what,
4756000	4758000	and maybe like what terrifies it.
4758000	4760000	What makes your little wee wee dance around?
4760000	4761000	And maybe what scares you,
4761000	4762000	what,
4762000	4763000	what you think might be a trigger.
4763000	4765000	What makes your little wee wee dance around?
4765000	4767000	What kind of music makes your wee wee dance around?
4767000	4768000	And what sort of dance is it?
4768000	4771000	Is it a foxtrot or a merengue?
4771000	4774000	My final thesis is those guys are,
4774000	4776000	I'm sure there's a lot of douche bags among those people,
4776000	4777000	but they're,
4777000	4779000	I perceive them as existing on a slightly higher,
4779000	4780000	more evolved level.
4780000	4783000	Cause I think that if we're all going to survive in a world where our kids are
4783000	4785000	able to like look at the internet and like,
4785000	4787000	how do people raise children?
4787000	4788000	Like,
4788000	4789000	like,
4789000	4790000	like,
4790000	4792000	like we're becoming like this myth that like,
4792000	4793000	well,
4793000	4794000	when a man likes a lady,
4794000	4796000	they go in the bedroom and then they,
4796000	4798000	she takes off her clothes and he loves what he sees.
4798000	4799000	He drops his pants and she's like,
4799000	4800000	wow.
4804000	4806000	And then she lays back and then he goes in there and he's just like,
4806000	4807000	root,
4807000	4808000	toot,
4809000	4810000	and they both love it.
4810000	4811000	And like,
4811000	4812000	well,
4812000	4814000	we used to think she didn't have to love it,
4814000	4816000	but now we know as of the seventies,
4816000	4817000	if she loves it,
4817000	4819000	it increases the chance of conception.
4820000	4823000	Because her car will glide his right into the egg.
4823000	4824000	And that's how sex,
4824000	4825000	it's like,
4825000	4826000	it doesn't,
4826000	4827000	like we're,
4827000	4829000	the people who are talking about like,
4829000	4830000	like,
4830000	4831000	you know,
4831000	4832000	you should,
4832000	4833000	you should,
4833000	4834000	you should dress like a leprechaun, man.
4834000	4836000	I want you to dress like a leprechaun.
4836000	4837000	And I don't,
4837000	4840000	I don't want to know when you're coming for my gold.
4843000	4845000	I'm just going to keep gold in my kitchen and,
4845000	4847000	and wear pants with a,
4847000	4849000	with a dick cut out and like,
4849000	4851000	but take three days,
4851000	4852000	surprise, shock me,
4852000	4854000	scare the shit out of me and be like,
4854000	4855000	where's me gold?
4855000	4856000	And like,
4856000	4858000	and then fucking get on me and just like,
4858000	4860000	make my limp dick hard.
4860000	4861000	Because I'll be like,
4861000	4862000	that's a leprechaun.
4862000	4863000	Like make it hard,
4863000	4864000	make it hard.
4864000	4866000	Unless I say tequila.
4868000	4869000	Let's be honest.
4869000	4870000	How many,
4870000	4871000	how many little weebies are dancing around right now?
4872000	4875000	A couple of polite shows of hands there.
4875000	4876000	I'm like,
4876000	4877000	I knew a girl that,
4877000	4878000	her job,
4878000	4879000	she gets paid quite a,
4879000	4880000	quite a good deal of money.
4880000	4882000	There's this billionaire that she works for,
4882000	4884000	apparently is quite good looking and very successful
4884000	4886000	and a nice guy and seems well adjusted.
4886000	4888000	But her job is to humiliate him on like,
4888000	4890000	kind of grand,
4890000	4891000	grand scale.
4891000	4892000	And like,
4892000	4893000	she's also supposed to like,
4893000	4894000	fuck him in the butt with a,
4894000	4897000	with a big strap on and stuff at the end of the whole bang.
4897000	4898000	But before that happens,
4899000	4901000	she's supposed to do high concept humiliation.
4901000	4903000	And so one of the ones that she did,
4903000	4904000	he's like,
4904000	4905000	and like,
4905000	4906000	here's a blank check.
4906000	4907000	Like,
4907000	4908000	like,
4908000	4909000	like,
4909000	4910000	like,
4910000	4911000	like,
4911000	4912000	remake Star Wars
4912000	4913000	and put my name on it.
4920000	4921000	$85 million!
4924000	4925000	This is,
4925000	4926000	this is terrible.
4926000	4927000	He's like,
4927000	4928000	the odds were rounder.
4928000	4929000	I don't know.
4929000	4931000	Oh no!
4931000	4932000	Boing!
4933000	4934000	No, fuck me in the butt.
4934000	4935000	Quick, fuck me in the butt.
4935000	4936000	High concept humiliation.
4938000	4939000	All right.
4939000	4940000	Wow, that was a goodie.
4940000	4941000	Thanks so much.
4941000	4942000	What a,
4942000	4943000	what an orgasm.
4943000	4944000	Back to work tomorrow morning.
4946000	4948000	One of the ones she did,
4948000	4950000	he got off a plane and she had like,
4950000	4951000	a team of people,
4951000	4952000	this is a cast of people,
4952000	4953000	and he doesn't know what it is.
4953000	4954000	And he gets off the plane
4954000	4956000	and there was like a car waiting for him
4956000	4957000	and his,
4957000	4958000	his publicist is there,
4958000	4959000	which is all fake.
4959000	4960000	He's greeted by his publicist,
4960000	4961000	his agent,
4961000	4962000	and he's,
4962000	4964000	he's going to a high fashion photo shoot.
4964000	4967000	And he goes to this office building
4967000	4970000	and he's told that he has to go do it.
4970000	4971000	He's a,
4971000	4972000	he's a supermodel.
4972000	4973000	And this guy is not a supermodel.
4973000	4977000	And waiting in the waiting room are the best looking men in the world.
4977000	4978000	Like,
4978000	4979000	like,
4979000	4980000	super good looking guys.
4980000	4981000	And they're all going in there
4981000	4984000	and he has to watch them do what he's about to do.
4984000	4985000	And so he has to get naked,
4985000	4986000	but then they dress him up like a little,
4986000	4988000	I forget what the costumes were,
4988000	4990000	but everybody there,
4990000	4991000	everyone he met that day,
4991000	4993000	all had to watch him do something.
4993000	4995000	And the whole thing was just completely
4995000	4996000	to like,
4996000	4998000	diminish him and to make him feel horrified
4998000	4999000	and like,
4999000	5000000	take his clothes off and dance around.
5000000	5001000	Like,
5001000	5002000	dress up with a little boop.
5002000	5003000	I don't know what the fuck it was.
5003000	5004000	But like,
5004000	5005000	she's like,
5005000	5006000	the hard part is like,
5006000	5007000	you got to keep coming up with these fucking ideas.
5007000	5012000	The easy part is fucking him in the butt there.
5012000	5013000	Yeah.
5013000	5014000	Nice work.
5014000	5015000	If you can get it,
5015000	5016000	you can get it.
5016000	5017000	If you try.
5017000	5018000	I would never want that job.
5018000	5019000	That would be terrible.
5019000	5020000	Yeah.
5020000	5021000	But I admire,
5021000	5022000	that's great.
5022000	5023000	Like,
5023000	5024000	because obviously the people who do it successfully
5024000	5025000	and get paid to do it,
5025000	5026000	they're,
5026000	5027000	they're,
5027000	5028000	it's like,
5028000	5030000	we live in a world where you can't make a lawn toy
5030000	5031000	without,
5031000	5032000	you know,
5032000	5033000	consumer advocacy oversight.
5033000	5034000	And it's like,
5034000	5035000	it's like,
5035000	5037000	we live in a world where you can't make a lawn toy
5037000	5038000	without,
5038000	5039000	you know,
5039000	5041000	consumer advocacy oversight.
5041000	5042000	Like,
5042000	5043000	like,
5043000	5044000	and like,
5044000	5049000	we don't have a lot of fatalities and emotional casualties of like,
5049000	5051000	the sex service industry.
5051000	5052000	And,
5052000	5053000	and we know that it's a big industry.
5053000	5057000	And so what we know is that even though it's mostly unregulated,
5057000	5059000	like there's a lot of very responsible,
5059000	5063000	independent agents out there that through nothing but their primal
5063000	5064000	understanding of,
5064000	5070000	this is part of a fantasy I paid Jeff to help.
5071000	5072000	Yeah.
5081000	5083000	It's supposed to be my show.
5085000	5086000	Stop.
5086000	5087000	Dancing.
5087000	5088000	Stop making.
5088000	5090000	He's dancing.
5091000	5093000	He's dancing.
5093000	5097000	If,
5097000	5101000	if I'm going like this and you go like that,
5101000	5102000	yeah,
5102000	5103000	I know what happens.
5105000	5106000	I'm explaining to them.
5106000	5107000	Your little wee wee dances, right?
5110000	5112000	First syllable in dancing is Dan.
5113000	5115000	To Mark, you've been quiet.
5115000	5116000	I have been quiet.
5116000	5117000	I have a,
5117000	5118000	one thing you can touch on is like the people who,
5118000	5120000	because in my experience with it,
5121000	5126000	I have a lot of friends who go in to cross that line into that,
5126000	5127000	but they, they don't,
5127000	5129000	they don't know that until it happens.
5129000	5130000	It sort of happens accidentally to them.
5130000	5134000	And then they have these stories and they tell you that they didn't know
5134000	5135000	that they had that part.
5135000	5136000	I had a friend who was a writer,
5138000	5142000	a very accomplished writer who went to a party once in Boston,
5142000	5143000	I think in a,
5143000	5147000	like a weird sort of loft party in Boston and was milling about with talking
5147000	5152000	to people and wandered around to look at the place and walked into a room.
5152000	5158000	All four walls of the room had murals of Lucille Ball painted on them.
5158000	5160000	And then the door shut behind him.
5160000	5161000	And there was,
5161000	5163000	was a woman in there who was,
5163000	5169000	I think it was her place and she was a dominatrix.
5169000	5170000	And she said,
5170000	5172000	who asked you to come into this room?
5172000	5173000	And then she said,
5173000	5174000	who told you to come in this room?
5174000	5176000	And he said, no, nobody.
5176000	5180000	And then she put him in a rack,
5180000	5183000	pulled a rack down from the ceiling and put him in.
5183000	5185000	And he's telling me this story and I'm listening.
5185000	5186000	He gets into this rack,
5186000	5190000	she straps him up in this thing and there's no suspension in the middle.
5190000	5191000	So he's sort of,
5191000	5192000	his body is held,
5192000	5195000	but the middle of his body is drawn down and it's discomforting.
5195000	5200000	And she raises him up to the ceiling so that he can see all four murals,
5200000	5201000	basically at the same time.
5201000	5203000	And there's all this pressure.
5203000	5205000	And she walks out of the room,
5205000	5208000	shuts the door, locks it and leaves.
5208000	5212000	She doesn't let him out until the morning.
5212000	5213000	And he comes down and he said,
5213000	5215000	so this happened on like a Friday or Saturday.
5215000	5217000	This is Thursday when he's telling me this.
5217000	5218000	And I was like,
5218000	5221000	you realize that every point of that you had to,
5221000	5224000	you could have outgunned her and walked around,
5224000	5226000	gotten out of the room.
5226000	5232000	You got into the rack and he just goes, yes.
5232000	5234000	And there are other examples of just friends of mine who have just said,
5234000	5236000	you're not going to believe what happened to me Thursday.
5236000	5239000	And then they tell the story and it's just, you know, it's, you know,
5239000	5243000	these things sometimes people don't know.
5243000	5245000	And then they, they just have it in them.
5245000	5246000	I think it,
5246000	5249000	it just is in them and they don't maybe go to it regularly.
5249000	5251000	I think that's true because I,
5251000	5255000	I will lay myself bare as much as I can here and say like,
5255000	5258000	I've never, I've never done anything like that.
5258000	5259000	All right.
5259000	5263000	So I think from the, from the moment a story was over at 42,
5263000	5266000	what I have done is gone through a bunch of relationships where I was very
5266000	5270000	much in charge and then a couple where things got a little sketchy and a
5270000	5274000	little hurt, a little hurtful, where I got a braided a little bit.
5274000	5278000	And I like, I, I don't,
5278000	5282000	I don't know if this makes me scarred or healthy or as is like,
5282000	5284000	is this what I was always into?
5284000	5287000	Like Dino says, like, it's not about the, it's not about like a hard-on at the
5287000	5290000	moment. It's not like, it's not, it's like a whole, there's this whole experience
5290000	5294000	and then you jerk off to it later. Like to, to, to quote Dino about this stuff.
5294000	5298000	Dino's whole thing is like, it's like, do you, do you get off?
5298000	5301000	And he's like, oh no, never. It's like, it's all for, for jerking off for the
5301000	5303000	rest of your life thinking about that.
5303000	5305000	Right. And so, and so then I think, okay,
5305000	5308000	you jerk off for the rest of your life thinking about that. And then I think,
5308000	5311000	well, what have I jerked off to the rest of my life thinking about?
5311000	5315000	And some of those things have been very emotionally painful.
5315000	5318000	Like I, and I don't know if that's like distancing, you know,
5318000	5322000	pornography can be very, can be very misogynistic.
5322000	5325000	Every once in a while,
5327000	5332000	male pornographers don't take the ladies feelings into account.
5332000	5335000	There are, there are, there are lots of self, self, self-employed female
5335000	5339000	pornographers out there who are the heroes of the new information age because
5339000	5342000	the first people to monetize the internet and they're millionaires and they're,
5342000	5345000	they don't have pimps and they're not, they don't exist in a world where they're
5345000	5347000	ruled and they're, they're doing what they like.
5347000	5352000	But pornography's history does have a trace of misogyny to it.
5352000	5357000	And, and I, and I wonder how much of that has to do with the fact that men are
5357000	5359000	like these brutes who like,
5359000	5365000	we exert all this control based on like this instinctive fear and need.
5365000	5370000	And then it's like getting hurt, getting, getting like getting victimized,
5370000	5375000	getting taken advantage of, you know, it's not like, I don't know.
5375000	5378000	I'm sorry, are you saying that I'm saying there are memories that you have that
5378000	5380000	were sexual memories, but that were still hurtful?
5380000	5381000	I don't know.
5381000	5382000	I'm saying, no, no, no.
5382000	5385000	I'm saying that I have, I have in the past, like throughout my life,
5385000	5389000	I've seen a pattern and I, I like where I like,
5389000	5394000	I will masturbate thinking about ex-girlfriends that I do not like,
5394000	5398000	that like, like you're cheating on me.
5398000	5399000	That's what I'm saying.
5399000	5403000	Like, like, like, like, like a cuckold, like, like, like, like thing.
5403000	5408000	Like, but I know from my life experience that I don't like that.
5408000	5410000	I don't want that to happen to me.
5410000	5414000	But then, so I don't know if when I'm like,
5414000	5421000	am I exhibiting a need during masturbation to distance myself from what I'm
5421000	5425000	thinking about so that it can be animalistic appropriately?
5425000	5427000	That's how I've always parsed it.
5427000	5430000	It's like when you're masturbating, you don't want it to be,
5430000	5433000	you don't want to think about the royal wedding.
5433000	5438000	I hope, I hope in spite of her low born upbringing that Princess Di is happy
5438000	5442000	in this marriage and I hope he really makes love to her tonight.
5442000	5445000	You, you, you think about people being animals, you know,
5445000	5449000	you think about the taboo and, and so I don't know if that's just like a
5449000	5452000	personal expression of that where you're just like, like, well, look, I want to,
5452000	5455000	this is, this is about self indulgence and this is about like,
5455000	5460000	like part of that trigger is like things I'm not supposed to be thinking about.
5460000	5464000	What if your girlfriend was cheating on you with Prince Charles?
5464000	5467000	She is.
5467000	5468000	What is this, the 80s?
5468000	5469000	And you're not supposed to say it.
5469000	5471000	We're all going to die tonight.
5471000	5476000	But courtesy of her majesty's somewhat untrained,
5476000	5480000	but still very effectual secret service.
5480000	5482000	Sorry, what were you going to say, DeMarche?
5482000	5487000	I just, I mean, that kind of sexuality is targeted, I think,
5487000	5489000	when you're, when you're thinking that way.
5489000	5494000	And it's psychologically it based if you subscribe to that,
5494000	5497000	but also neurologically it's Olympic and that's,
5497000	5499000	and that system kind of acts on its own.
5499000	5504000	It sort of bridges that gap between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.
5504000	5507000	And so you can do targeted thinking.
5507000	5509000	You can find, and it actually does,
5509000	5512000	I think isolate the things that you're concerned,
5512000	5514000	the narrative aspects of it, like kind of pushes them out.
5514000	5515000	It edits them out.
5515000	5519000	And it just sort of is the node is those things that trigger those dendrites
5519000	5521000	and make those things, make all those things move.
5521000	5526000	I just like them big old titties.
5526000	5528000	What if you had 17 of them?
5528000	5531000	Brought to you by Frito-Lay.
5531000	5532000	Brings it all around.
5532000	5534000	That's not, no, that's not how the show ends.
5534000	5535000	You can't force it to end.
5535000	5536000	No.
5536000	5538000	You don't get to pick the ending of the show.
5538000	5541000	I know you have school tomorrow.
5541000	5545000	We don't end before 10 ever.
5545000	5548000	You're totally going to end the show.
5548000	5549000	I hate it.
5549000	5551000	I don't want to end the show.
5551000	5552000	I don't.
5552000	5554000	Are we bringing, is it just us tonight?
5554000	5557000	I want to bring out as a Spencer replacement,
5557000	5560000	but not, he's not going to guide us through D&D unless he wants to,
5560000	5562000	but he probably won't.
5562000	5566000	My other assistant, Steve Levy.
5566000	5574000	What up, Steve?
5574000	5580000	You can choose if you sit there or sit in the Spencer seat.
5580000	5582000	Hello.
5582000	5590000	My favorite thing about Steve is he's the opposite of Spencer.
5590000	5591000	Is that right?
5591000	5592000	Yeah.
5592000	5595000	You're very clean shaven and very nervous.
5595000	5597000	Not that Spencer's not nervous.
5597000	5600000	I mean, and you care about me?
5600000	5602000	Yeah, I do.
5602000	5605000	Spencer does as well.
5605000	5608000	Spencer does not care about me.
5609000	5614000	If Spencer and I were somehow locked alone in a home and I died,
5614000	5618000	like the dog would eat my face first.
5618000	5620000	The cat, third.
5620000	5622000	Spencer, second.
5622000	5625000	I don't know about that.
5625000	5629000	He doesn't, but I'm saying you're compassionate.
5629000	5632000	What is the division of labor between these two assistants?
5632000	5633000	I will tell you.
5633000	5636000	Does one hunt and one gather?
5637000	5641000	I used to have Daniella, who then she got pregnant,
5641000	5644000	she raised her kid in the office.
5644000	5648000	I did my best to be a part of this modern workplace
5648000	5652000	where we don't provide women with any kind of acknowledgment
5652000	5657000	that maternity is part of healthcare, blah, blah, blah.
5657000	5662000	Points, points, points, ladies, thank you.
5663000	5665000	There's a crib next to my desk.
5665000	5667000	I didn't change the diapers,
5667000	5670000	but I took all the Instagrams of the baby.
5670000	5673000	Everything a modern boss should do.
5673000	5677000	Making your employee bring the baby to work.
5677000	5679000	Not maternity leave.
5679000	5681000	No, she had maternity leave.
5681000	5683000	How dare you?
5683000	5685000	That's not enough.
5685000	5687000	When the baby was of a certain age.
5687000	5688000	It's childcare.
5688000	5690000	Once you have a baby, the child needs care.
5690000	5693000	We tell parents that they both have to work,
5693000	5695000	but we also simultaneously tell them,
5695000	5698000	oh, yeah, you should definitely have kids.
5698000	5700000	Then when a mother has a baby,
5700000	5702000	we act like they got the flu.
5702000	5704000	We're like, oh, okay.
5704000	5706000	Go home for a while and come back when you're better,
5706000	5708000	which means you can hire a nanny?
5708000	5710000	If you can't afford that,
5710000	5713000	i.e. you're 99% of everybody,
5713000	5715000	then what are you doing?
5715000	5718000	In our case, the baby was in a drawer.
5720000	5723000	Their faces are so smooth at that point.
5723000	5728000	They make great mouse pads for the laser-tracking ones,
5728000	5732000	not the old ball ones, because they're like pugs.
5732000	5734000	They have accumulated.
5734000	5738000	This wasn't why I wanted to bring this up.
5738000	5741000	Daniella eventually had to leave by virtue of the call.
5741000	5743000	She was like, you know,
5743000	5745000	I feel like I'm being a bad assistant and a bad mother,
5745000	5749000	and obviously I'm going to choose to be a good mother.
5750000	5752000	Spencer filled that first hole, right?
5752000	5754000	Well, some time along,
5754000	5757000	when Spencer filled the first hole...
5757000	5760000	And you never forget that.
5760000	5762000	It was a claw hammer, by the way.
5762000	5764000	When she got pregnant,
5764000	5766000	I started to feel guilty about making her go to Toys R Us
5766000	5769000	to buy video games.
5769000	5772000	You answer the phones,
5772000	5774000	do appointments and all this stuff.
5774000	5776000	You're the clerical assistant.
5776000	5777000	That's what you do.
5778000	5780000	This is a big job.
5780000	5783000	Full-time job for old popular man, right?
5783000	5784000	Right.
5784000	5787000	Lots of people want to interview me.
5787000	5788000	It's true.
5788000	5789000	Yeah.
5789000	5792000	Vanity fair, I'm sure, or something.
5792000	5795000	So at that point, brought Spencer on,
5795000	5799000	because Spencer was in the back room of the Apple store.
5799000	5801000	So Spencer's going to schlep.
5801000	5803000	He's going to be a bee assistant.
5803000	5806000	If I need video games, I'll go get him.
5806000	5809000	If I need a head photo, he'll schlep.
5809000	5813000	If you need an eye-harmon fashion, he'll do that for you.
5813000	5817000	Yeah, he'll fill the bar at home,
5817000	5821000	or the schleppy personal assistant stuff,
5821000	5823000	and then the business assistant.
5823000	5824000	That's the division.
5824000	5827000	Yeah, I guess that's sort of how it is.
5827000	5829000	But Spencer does a lot more.
5829000	5832000	He's been helping me in a lot of ways.
5832000	5833000	Fuck that guy.
5834000	5836000	All he does is go to Toys R Us.
5836000	5837000	No, I'm not.
5837000	5841000	It sounds like I thought it sounded like both of you do a lot.
5841000	5844000	I wouldn't want to schlep or fucking handle it.
5844000	5847000	I was explaining to Jeff, boy, I'm getting drunk.
5847000	5854000	So when Daniella left, and she helped me find her last act
5854000	5857000	as one of the greatest assistants in the world.
5857000	5859000	She took her baby out of the drawer.
5860000	5864000	I said, your baby and your gun.
5864000	5866000	And she put them on the table.
5868000	5869000	I took them.
5869000	5870000	I don't know why I took them.
5870000	5871000	You took the baby?
5871000	5875000	Yeah, I guess it's just part of, like, she's on suspension, I guess.
5875000	5877000	But if I catch her pursuing this case.
5877000	5880000	You're getting too close to this baby.
5880000	5882000	I want you to have this baby.
5882000	5886000	And then I interviewed a bunch of candidates,
5886000	5888000	and one of them was Steve.
5888000	5890000	And that's Steve's role.
5890000	5895000	He's the new Daniella, whereas Spencer is just kind of like,
5895000	5899000	he's like a chauffeur.
5899000	5902000	He has to drive me everywhere, because I still don't have a car.
5902000	5904000	That's Spencer.
5904000	5907000	And then, yes, good.
5907000	5909000	Does he provide any bodyguard service?
5909000	5910000	He's a big fella.
5910000	5912000	He's got that wolf kick defense thing.
5913000	5916000	I feel like Spencer adds against nature.
5916000	5919000	I think if you got attacked by any group of anything,
5919000	5921000	be they thugs or wolves or anything,
5921000	5926000	I think Spencer might just tap into some weird reservoir of rage
5926000	5928000	and really fucking hurt people.
5928000	5932000	I'm sure, yeah, I think between me and Spencer, you know,
5932000	5939000	like, if a very, very small unarmed preteen girl,
5940000	5943000	you're kind of like Rodney Dangerfield,
5943000	5945000	and I forget the actor's name, Lou.
5945000	5947000	Bert Young.
5947000	5949000	Back to school.
5949000	5952000	Anyway, so, Steve, Spencer's not here,
5952000	5956000	so I thought I'd bring you up, and we'd get to know you.
5956000	5958000	That sounds good.
5958000	5960000	Sorry, I'm getting text.
5960000	5966000	Steve, what's the most satisfying element of being a Harmon assistant?
5967000	5970000	Oh, so Aaron's actually also...
5970000	5971000	Maybe my...
5971000	5974000	I thought it was obvious that I value Spencer a lot,
5974000	5979000	so Aaron's warning me that it sounds like I don't think Spencer does anything.
5979000	5983000	I would say to balance things out a little bit,
5983000	5985000	say something nice about Spencer.
5985000	5988000	I mean, the guy who couldn't bother to be here?
5988000	5990000	He's amazing.
5990000	5992000	That's not fair.
5992000	5995000	And the next time he's here, I'm going to crush him.
5996000	5998000	And I'll tell you one more thing, Eugene.
6001000	6004000	Spencer, if you're out there, and I hope you are,
6004000	6006000	the show is called Harmon Town,
6006000	6008000	but no matter when Greg Proops came on or Ryan Styles
6008000	6010000	or somebody made a dig on Spencer,
6010000	6012000	fucking sacred territory.
6012000	6014000	Oh, man, no way.
6014000	6016000	Why do you think I hate him?
6016000	6017000	No, no, no.
6017000	6018000	He's my son.
6018000	6019000	What do you want me to say?
6019000	6020000	He's my son.
6020000	6021000	What do you want me to say?
6021000	6023000	Tell him you love him.
6024000	6025000	Tell your son you love him.
6025000	6027000	I don't know what love is.
6028000	6030000	I have hired him to help me find out.
6030000	6031000	You're being a...
6031000	6033000	He does a very good job.
6033000	6035000	You're being the great Dantini right now.
6035000	6037000	You're being a harsh father.
6037000	6038000	It's my instinct.
6041000	6042000	Why is it...
6042000	6044000	What do you like about him?
6044000	6046000	Name a couple of things that you like about him,
6046000	6047000	and they're valuable to you.
6047000	6050000	The same thing as them is beard, and he's funny.
6050000	6054000	It's a flannel shirt, and it's, like, May, you know?
6054000	6057000	Do you consider him a friend, a pal, a confidant?
6057000	6058000	Yeah, definitely, yeah.
6058000	6061000	I only have, like, three friends, you know?
6061000	6062000	Like, yeah.
6064000	6066000	If you and Dino, like, stop hanging out with me,
6066000	6069000	I'd be like, Dana Gould?
6071000	6073000	And he'd be like, hey, Dan, what's going on?
6073000	6077000	I'd be like, yeah, remember 1995 when we said we'd hang out?
6078000	6080000	So, yes, Spencer's my friend.
6080000	6083000	But I guess I undersold that.
6084000	6086000	I'm not going to pressure you,
6086000	6089000	because you were having a difficult time expressing...
6089000	6091000	Isn't that the highest compliment?
6091000	6092000	Affection. No, it's not...
6092000	6094000	The highest compliment is an actual high compliment.
6096000	6097000	He's...
6099000	6102000	I see myself in him, and I respect him,
6102000	6105000	and even that's not a good enough compliment, because you know...
6105000	6106000	No, that's a good compliment.
6106000	6109000	He's not like a mini me, or anything like that.
6109000	6111000	I just like, you know, I like him,
6111000	6113000	and I feel very comfortable with him.
6113000	6114000	That's the thing.
6114000	6117000	When he comes and picks me up, like, I've talked about that before.
6117000	6121000	Like, he and I are in the same wavelength, or lack of it.
6121000	6125000	Like, other people, there's always that inevitable point where it's like...
6127000	6132000	I'm fine with the fact that I haven't said that you're doing a good job
6132000	6135000	for the last four weeks, but are you, you know?
6135000	6137000	And I warned you about that when I interviewed you.
6137000	6140000	I think that drives a lot of people screaming out of the building.
6140000	6141000	Yeah.
6141000	6145000	But Spencer's one of the most charming, genuine, moral people
6145000	6148000	I think I've ever met, and that's just part of the allure.
6148000	6150000	Well, like, for example...
6150000	6151000	Here, here.
6151000	6156000	So, this might really embarrass Marissa, I hope it doesn't,
6156000	6159000	but when she was visiting...
6159000	6161000	She was here for all this while she was getting her...
6161000	6163000	She was doing her post-productive thing.
6163000	6164000	Who's Marissa?
6164000	6169000	Marissa was... She was the first person to ever do a blog about us.
6169000	6172000	She was like... She's the number one absolute...
6172000	6173000	Of course, yeah, yeah.
6173000	6174000	Beyond community fans.
6174000	6179000	She was like a Dan Harmon fan before that was a thing,
6179000	6186000	and as a delightful young lady, and really smart and cool and balanced,
6186000	6192000	and she came to our wedding, and she's like a friend.
6193000	6195000	She's more than a fan. She's like a friend.
6195000	6200000	And she was in L.A. getting her degree in post-production,
6200000	6204000	and I brought her over to the community, and we were hanging out.
6204000	6206000	We were doing all this stuff, and we're all like,
6206000	6208000	let's go out and get a drink and all this stuff,
6208000	6210000	and Marissa's like, I gotta pack up my shit,
6210000	6213000	and I got my truck full of shit, and all this stuff, blah, blah, blah.
6213000	6217000	Marissa's coming to meet us at this restaurant to have a drink,
6217000	6218000	and she gets...
6218000	6219000	She was moving that day.
6219000	6221000	All of her stuff was packed in her car.
6221000	6222000	She gets in this terrible...
6222000	6225000	Well, not terrible, but all...
6225000	6226000	It was a scary accident.
6226000	6229000	She gets in a car accident.
6229000	6232000	And she's freaking out, because she's young,
6232000	6235000	and anyone freaks out when they get in a car accident,
6235000	6238000	but you're first one, and you're out of town,
6238000	6242000	and your shit's in the back seat, and you don't...
6242000	6247000	She was really freaking out, and Spencer and Steve ran over there,
6247000	6248000	and Steve...
6248000	6250000	I didn't fucking go.
6250000	6251000	I was like...
6251000	6253000	She was like a block from the restaurant,
6253000	6256000	and I was like, Steve, Spencer...
6258000	6260000	They're like your angels to your Charlie.
6260000	6264000	Tell her, I'll cover the insurance bill, whatever.
6264000	6266000	You know, like, I'll throw money at shit,
6266000	6267000	but I'm not like...
6267000	6268000	I don't have a heart.
6268000	6270000	I'm a horrible, heartless villain.
6270000	6271000	It's not true.
6271000	6273000	And these guys ran over...
6273000	6274000	I thank you.
6274000	6276000	You get a bonus for this segment.
6277000	6282000	But anyways, just talking about Spencer...
6282000	6285000	Spencer puts his money where his mouth is in terms of a personality,
6285000	6288000	because Steve's account of it was like,
6288000	6290000	not only did Spencer go over there and help out,
6290000	6295000	but actually, at every accident scene,
6295000	6298000	there's a little flaw in our justice system
6298000	6300000	where it's like two people collide,
6300000	6302000	no one knows who faulted it is,
6302000	6303000	two civil servants show up...
6303000	6304000	And it's traumatic.
6305000	6307000	Two people are traumatized,
6307000	6309000	and two guys with badges and guns show up,
6309000	6312000	and they basically are a judge jury.
6312000	6314000	It basically ends with them.
6314000	6316000	They have to get out of the car and make their decision.
6316000	6317000	Spencer was so...
6317000	6320000	They were so taken with Spencer that...
6320000	6322000	He was so warm and...
6323000	6324000	I was shocked.
6324000	6325000	I'm pretty sure...
6325000	6327000	We all have our qualities.
6327000	6330000	They're kind of our lead qualities.
6330000	6332000	And also, I think that we're all good people,
6332000	6334000	but I don't know very many people...
6334000	6335000	Thank you.
6336000	6337000	I don't know very many people
6337000	6339000	that the lead quality that I would say about them...
6339000	6342000	I know some, but Spencer's one of the few people I know that...
6342000	6344000	The first quality I say, he's good.
6344000	6346000	Spencer is a good person.
6346000	6349000	Not that we're not good people, but he leads with good.
6349000	6352000	And you said it, Steve, that he's a moral person.
6352000	6354000	I think that he has an intense moral compass,
6354000	6355000	which I think is very valuable.
6355000	6356000	Yeah, he wants to do the right thing,
6356000	6358000	and he thinks about that a lot.
6358000	6359000	He doesn't want to do the popular thing.
6359000	6360000	He doesn't want to even do the thing.
6361000	6363000	I think I fall short of that, where I'm like,
6363000	6365000	what do most people think is the right thing?
6365000	6368000	I want to do that, if they're looking.
6368000	6369000	Spencer doesn't hesitate.
6369000	6371000	Spencer knows what's the right thing to do.
6371000	6373000	Spencer doesn't give the panhandlers,
6373000	6377000	but does jump out of his car to give to the people
6377000	6381000	that are going through recycling bins, getting shit,
6381000	6383000	even though they might tell him to go fuck himself,
6383000	6385000	because they didn't ask for anything,
6385000	6387000	but he's giving them money.
6387000	6389000	He's like, puzzling through in his head,
6389000	6393000	do you actually use your pocket change to help society?
6393000	6396000	Actually, that sounds kind of draconian and Randish,
6396000	6400000	but I mean, he thinks about morality.
6400000	6401000	He thinks about being a good person,
6401000	6406000	and I could picture him like,
6406000	6409000	that's why I didn't go over there.
6409000	6411000	There's going to be hysterical people getting out of cars,
6411000	6412000	pointing at each other and shrieking,
6412000	6413000	this is your fault, no, it's your fault,
6413000	6415000	and there's going to be two douchebag cops
6415000	6417000	who don't know what to do,
6417000	6418000	but they're going to file their little report,
6418000	6420000	and all this shit's going to be handled by insurance companies,
6420000	6422000	and I don't want anything to do with this shit.
6422000	6423000	Just tell me who to write the check out to,
6423000	6424000	and I don't fucking care.
6424000	6426000	Spencer went over there with his little cargo shorts
6426000	6427000	and his flannel shirt.
6427000	6430000	It was probably the reason why the cops were basically like,
6430000	6432000	yeah, it was probably the other lady's fault,
6432000	6435000	because she was screaming bloody murder,
6435000	6438000	and Marissa was traumatized and freaking out,
6438000	6440000	having this lady shrieking at her,
6440000	6444000	well, not at her, but about her, to the cops.
6445000	6448000	But Spencer was just like, well, you were there.
6448000	6449000	Yeah, yeah.
6449000	6454000	The first thing I saw was Marissa was noticeably upset,
6454000	6456000	and her car was totaled.
6456000	6458000	It was destroyed.
6458000	6460000	And Spencer, the first thing he did,
6460000	6462000	he walked over and he gave her this big hug,
6462000	6465000	and he was like, it's going to be okay.
6465000	6469000	Whatever happens, you're healthy,
6469000	6473000	and it's a vehicle, it's aluminum, I don't know.
6473000	6474000	What is it?
6474000	6475000	Aluminium.
6475000	6476000	Steel?
6476000	6477000	Aluminium.
6477000	6478000	Yeah.
6478000	6481000	Everything's going to be okay,
6481000	6484000	and she just had all these things going through her head,
6484000	6486000	like, how am I going to pay for all this?
6486000	6488000	Am I going to get a new car?
6488000	6489000	Me, that's the answer.
6489000	6491000	I'm going to pay for it.
6491000	6494000	That's my morality.
6494000	6498000	Spencer's like, well, one thing at a time.
6498000	6501000	Let's get through this whole process with the police,
6501000	6504000	and I know this woman's an insane person right now,
6504000	6506000	and she won't even talk to you.
6506000	6509000	She wouldn't even look at Marissa's face.
6509000	6512000	Marissa would say, I'm sorry,
6512000	6516000	trying to talk to this woman so they can come
6516000	6518000	to some kind of an agreement,
6518000	6520000	but she wouldn't even talk to her.
6520000	6522000	It was really terrible.
6522000	6524000	But Spencer was there through the whole thing,
6524000	6526000	and the cops showed up.
6526000	6527000	If I ever got a car accident,
6527000	6530000	I would want somebody who's good at logic and maps to go,
6530000	6532000	there's no way the car could have gone there,
6532000	6535000	because the cars only moved at this rate per second.
6535000	6537000	Spencer was like that,
6537000	6539000	so he examined, before the cops even got there,
6539000	6542000	he examined the damage of Marissa's car and the woman's car,
6542000	6546000	and he was like, okay, Marissa,
6546000	6548000	take me through it.
6548000	6550000	What happened?
6550000	6552000	So she was like, you know, this guy,
6552000	6554000	I was in the left-most lane,
6554000	6556000	and we were in a red light,
6556000	6558000	and the guy waved me on because I had my blinker on
6558000	6560000	to get into the next lane,
6560000	6562000	and so this guy was stopped,
6562000	6565000	and Marissa went into the next lane,
6565000	6567000	and he held up traffic for her to move on.
6567000	6571000	And her car, I guess, she looked,
6571000	6576000	and she said another blinker to move into the right-most lane,
6576000	6580000	and this car just whizzed up and just nailed her.
6580000	6584000	And so Spencer looked at the damage, and he goes,
6584000	6587000	she was definitely speeding or texting.
6587000	6592000	You know, like, you know, he, so, you know.
6592000	6594000	Spencer, CSI.
6594000	6596000	Yeah, it's the kind of thing, she was like,
6596000	6598000	you know, I shouldn't have cut across two lanes,
6598000	6600000	but Spencer's like,
6600000	6603000	but for the amount of damage that happened here,
6603000	6605000	she was doing something illicit.
6605000	6607000	Like, there was something wrong.
6607000	6609000	And then the cops came, and they,
6609000	6611000	Marissa was totally honest with them, you know,
6611000	6613000	I cut across like two lanes, or whatever it was,
6613000	6615000	and they were like, yeah, you shouldn't do that.
6615000	6617000	But at the same time, they were like,
6617000	6619000	ma'am, were you looking at your phone?
6619000	6621000	Were you texting?
6621000	6622000	No, I was texting.
6622000	6624000	You know, like, she's from Miami.
6624000	6626000	It was legal there until last year.
6626000	6628000	You could, like, look at your phone,
6628000	6629000	or, like, text on your phone.
6629000	6630000	This is a crazy place.
6630000	6632000	Don't go to Miami.
6632000	6634000	Well, leave me, but, all right.
6634000	6637000	So aside from noticing how awesome Spencer is,
6637000	6641000	your talents include helping me edit,
6641000	6644000	like, the last half of Season 6 of Community.
6644000	6646000	Because I was fucking checked out.
6646000	6647000	This guy's awesome.
6647000	6649000	He doesn't have anybody here to say,
6649000	6650000	what about Steve Levy?
6650000	6652000	That's why I wanted to bring him up.
6652000	6655000	Yeah, fuck Spencer.
6655000	6657000	That's what you're saying.
6657000	6661000	Wait, so, Dan, I think you told me that there were times
6661000	6664000	when you were like, I'm tired,
6664000	6666000	and you let Steve take the wheel?
6666000	6668000	Like, he took the helm sometimes?
6668000	6669000	Absolutely.
6669000	6672000	I don't want him to get blamed if Season 6 sucks.
6673000	6676000	Or get in trouble with a guild or a union or something.
6676000	6678000	No, no, but I'm saying, like, I'm saying,
6678000	6680000	there were times when I would have phoned it in.
6680000	6683000	And, like, Steve had that enthusiasm.
6683000	6685000	Which is also, like, Chris McKenna before him
6685000	6687000	and Ruthie Aslan, the editor.
6687000	6690000	Like, I am at the mercy of people who,
6690000	6692000	at the moment of my exhaustion
6692000	6695000	and the point where I'm reading the 700th tweet
6695000	6698000	that's, like, you know, pushing me, like, out the door
6698000	6700000	where I'm just like, I don't, you know, who cares?
6700000	6702000	It's funny enough. It's good enough.
6702000	6704000	There's always, there's someone else that goes like,
6704000	6706000	yeah, but what if you did this?
6706000	6713000	And, like, Ruthie and Steve and, I mean,
6713000	6716000	just in the edit bay, like, there at the end.
6716000	6719000	And our other editors, in case they're listening,
6719000	6723000	JP and Billy, and also the hairdresser.
6723000	6728000	But, you know, it was awesome to have somebody,
6728000	6730000	because you, I'm never going to say to somebody,
6730000	6732000	come to the edit bay with me.
6732000	6734000	You said, hey, I'm interested in that.
6734000	6736000	Okay, good. Come in here.
6736000	6740000	And then you were like, what if you did that instead?
6740000	6743000	And there's like, by the way, I've never said this to you
6743000	6744000	now that we're done.
6744000	6747000	There's a lot of hazing that happens when you do that.
6747000	6750000	Like, the editors, out of protection for the whole thing,
6750000	6754000	like, they weren't too coy about, like, oh, no.
6755000	6759000	If you had been capable of being shamed into silence,
6759000	6761000	they would have found that button.
6761000	6763000	Well, at first, I was terrified of saying anything,
6763000	6766000	but there were, like, a couple bits in Grifter
6766000	6769000	where you're like, I really wanted to work this way,
6769000	6773000	but I don't know, like, I can't think of it.
6773000	6774000	I don't know, like, right now in this moment,
6774000	6776000	I don't know how to make it work.
6776000	6778000	And then I was like, what if we did that?
6778000	6779000	And then, yeah.
6779000	6780000	Did you, like, Hugh Jackman take your shirt off
6780000	6782000	and start editing with both hands?
6783000	6786000	No.
6786000	6787000	Not quite.
6787000	6790000	I love both my children.
6790000	6791000	That's diminishing.
6791000	6794000	They're both adult males, Dan.
6794000	6797000	Yeah, and I'm really old and about to die.
6797000	6800000	I should have adult males for children.
6800000	6804000	Are you comfortable, Steve, in the role of Dan's son?
6804000	6806000	Sure.
6806000	6807000	Yeah.
6807000	6810000	See, Steve, what's your goal?
6811000	6812000	What are you aiming towards?
6812000	6814000	You seem like you're probably an ambitious fellow
6814000	6815000	in your own way.
6815000	6818000	I guess, like, producing or directing.
6818000	6819000	Television, film?
6819000	6821000	TV for now, I guess, yeah.
6821000	6822000	Great.
6822000	6823000	Yeah.
6823000	6824000	So far, so good.
6824000	6826000	It's been an amazing process,
6826000	6829000	and Dan's a phenomenal boss.
6829000	6830000	Tell them why.
6830000	6832000	For all the haters out there, fuck you.
6832000	6834000	You're wrong.
6834000	6835000	What do you mean?
6835000	6838000	There's haters?
6839000	6841000	Well, okay, so...
