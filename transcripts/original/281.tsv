0	18480	Ladies and gentlemen, coming to you from downtown Burbank, California, Hormontown, now in session.
18480	28480	Let's welcome the Dungeon Master himself, Spencer, Criterion Edition, Crittenden, here he comes.
32480	43480	And now, let's welcome the Mayor of Hormontown, Dan Hormontown.
44480	45480	Thank you.
45480	50480	Here's the Mayor of Hormontown in front of us, Dan Hormontown.
50480	56480	Yo, yo, yo, rapping, rapping, rapping at the top of the show.
56480	57480	Flow.
57480	58480	Alright.
58480	62480	Oh yeah, that was slick, man.
62480	63480	Holy shit.
63480	71480	I think that was my most pared down, but therefore admirable freestyling in the history of the show.
72480	75480	Well, Shrab's comtrolling this episode.
75480	77480	You're welcome, Sauron.
77480	79480	He looks like no-face.
79480	82480	He's already doing physical bits.
82480	86480	Hey, I was the one that wanted to do the podcast on video.
86480	88480	This is you.
88480	89480	Yeah, this is you.
89480	90480	What do you remind me of?
90480	93480	That's a Sesame Street Muppet, right?
93480	95480	Those yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, guys.
95480	97480	Yeah, I remind you of that.
97480	99480	In that jack-eye with the hood over.
99480	102480	Okay, in the audio world, what's going on?
102480	103480	Nothing.
103480	105480	I'm on deadline.
105480	110480	I have to finish the script tonight, so I'm going to try to...
110480	112480	So we're going to talk double fast to get the show down.
112480	117480	Wait, but don't distract from what's going on in the audio world.
117480	118480	Oh.
118480	122480	Well, that's what I was just switching over to not talking about what Shrab looked like.
122480	124480	Oh, right.
124480	126480	No, let's talk about what Shrab looks like.
126480	129480	Well, that would be going back into the video world.
129480	130480	Oh, shit.
130480	132480	Yeah, let's not do that.
132480	136480	Let's not go back into the video world.
136480	138480	Well, it's going to be a great show.
138480	139480	No, yeah.
139480	146480	Never in the history of the opening of a show have there ever been more milestones of that in the span of two minutes.
146480	150480	This is the part where I talk about whatever's going on.
150480	152480	Like I said, I got to finish the script.
152480	155480	Excuse me.
155480	157480	That was Shrab.
157480	159480	No, it wasn't.
159480	166480	I covered my mouth. I didn't think you would hear that.
166480	184480	Yeah, so I'll probably have one drink at some point in the show, maybe even three, because I'll start to get nervous that the show is going poorly because I'm bad at doing a show, but I really got to keep my shit together.
184480	188480	I got a fucking my therapist told me this.
188480	193480	I am sitting on this script because it is my last chance to be miserable.
193480	199480	I am this close to happy.
199480	200480	That's interesting.
200480	201480	That's interesting.
201480	202480	I'm going through the same thing myself.
202480	203480	I'm having a.
203480	205480	What are you using to make yourself miserable?
205480	206480	Doing nothing.
206480	210480	Just just just postponing stuff.
210480	216480	I mean, we're so we're well, Cody Cody right now is at home just.
216480	223480	You know, she probably doesn't mind me telling this because she's she just finished.
223480	237480	She's on hiatus at her regular job and then she her her her other project that she like put a lot, you know, she's spent a year of a relationship with this this series of scripts and and that lifetime has come to an end.
237480	242480	And so she's having that like writer postpartum kind of depression.
242480	245480	And it's just funny because we're all miserable.
245480	247480	You're miserable because you don't have a job to do.
247480	249480	Cody's miserable because her job is over.
249480	252480	I'm miserable because I won't stop working.
252480	256480	And and I think it's like the grass is greener.
256480	263480	Never applied more like we we we are afraid to deal.
263480	266480	Look, I'm just going to go there because my therapist goes there.
266480	269480	We're afraid to deal with God like I.
269480	275480	And if you're an atheist, I applaud you because that just means you're a scientist and a skeptic.
275480	278480	And we need those more than ever.
278480	282480	So when I say God, you just think universe, think chaos.
282480	290480	But I don't want to pussyfoot around about it because I believe in a God that like made my sister retarded and will just give you leukemia because he's bored.
290480	301480	So I'm like scared of God and like I don't want to move on to that part of my life where I have to have a relationship with this thing I picture as a big Dan Harmon head in the sky.
301480	308480	That's like psycho and just does crazy shit just to remind you that he's around.
308480	314480	I feel like a relationship with God is like owing Polly and good fellas money.
314480	319480	It's like like he's doing you favors and now you're like, what do I have to do and you don't know.
319480	323480	And I've wanted like forever to like control that.
323480	333480	You know, I've wanted to do like it's that's what that's what a writer does or a workaholic does is they say, well, I'm in charge of my bad luck and my good luck.
333480	339480	I'm in charge of of of like whether or not I'm having a bad day.
339480	344480	But it's crazy to do that because I've been doing it for 45 years.
344480	347480	And what if tomorrow I find a lump or whatever?
347480	350480	It's like I'm going to be double the sucker.
350480	354480	I just got to I just got to stop pretending like it's hard to write.
354480	358480	It's just been the biggest scam that I've ever perpetrated on myself and humanity.
358480	361480	It's just not what I do is not difficult.
361480	363480	And I think I'm ashamed of that.
363480	367480	And like I try to make it like it's like art or something.
367480	375480	And it's like you think you're doing that because if it wasn't difficult, it wouldn't be work.
375480	383480	Yeah. Yeah. I think the voice of my brother who I've been I've tried not to mention on this podcast because we don't speak to each other because I mentioned him on the podcast.
383480	385480	So I've tried to like I'm not going to talk about my brother.
385480	391480	But another way of looking at it is I can do nothing but talk shit about my brother now forever.
391480	394480	But but but you know, my brother is five years older than me.
394480	404480	And growing up like just like this chorus of like he was the he was the guy who was like, yeah, you're not you got mom convinced.
404480	407480	But you're a fucking idiot.
407480	409480	You're you're not an idiot.
409480	410480	My brother knew I was smart.
410480	420480	But like you're not special. You're not like like you just you're you're just a lazy piece of shit, you know, and like you're spoiled and you're entitled and mom buys it.
420480	433480	And just because just because I am five years older than you and I smoke weed first and I set fire to the mailbox first and then the driveway first and then I poured motor oil and the neighbors swimming pool first and dropped out of high school first.
433480	438480	And hit the house with a baseball bat first, just because I'm doing all those things first doesn't mean you're not going to do them.
438480	441480	And even if you don't do them, it'll only because you had me as an example.
441480	444480	And the truth is, you're just a charlatan, you know, you're just like this.
444480	446480	You just you're you're the baby.
446480	448480	You're like, you got you got it all.
448480	451480	You got you got you got everything like lined lined up for you.
451480	462480	And and that that voice is an important voice because it keeps you especially in these days of like monitoring, checking privilege and whatever.
462480	471480	It's like, I got I got like this great fucking antenna for that because I'm just always going, you little piece of shit in my head over and over again.
471480	474480	Like, you're not you're not stuff trying to act like you're fucking talented.
474480	476480	You're not talented and all this stuff.
476480	488480	And so the idea of me being like like just good or lucky, like, you know, it has to do with my sister, too.
488480	491480	It's like it's just it just fucks with me.
491480	499480	But it's it's it's it's been selfish to to like think of it that way.
499480	501480	It's been it's it's it doesn't make any sense.
501480	502480	It's not productive at all.
502480	504480	Sorry, I have my back to you, Spencer.
504480	506480	No, I kind of had a suspicion that you're God.
506480	509480	So I wanted to leave you out of this for a little.
509480	510480	Right.
510480	514480	If you are God, prove it.
515480	521480	If I was God, wouldn't it like betray my purposes to prove it at this point?
521480	522480	He just proved that.
522480	524480	I don't think so.
524480	529480	I my therapist said, could you be crazier?
533480	535480	That's what she wants.
536480	547480	No, she said she said, could you live with the fact that you weren't like the special one?
547480	555480	You know, like, I mean, like, you know, like you because you you feel like because I've I've had problems where I'm just like,
555480	562480	well, you know, you get you get the spotlight and and then all of a sudden your brain goes blank and you can't figure it out or whatever.
562480	567480	And just like, well, well, maybe don't be tempted by the spotlight.
567480	570480	You know, you don't have to be the best.
570480	571480	Yeah.
571480	580480	And especially with writing, you know, like writing is and any art is like when you go like, oh, I'm going to make the best thing I've ever done before.
580480	582480	That's usually failure.
582480	587480	But if you go, I'm going to make a piece of shit, that's just going to be fun to do when you do your best work.
587480	603480	Yeah. And and another thing my therapist pointed out is like, you know what, you know what, aside from being like cheating, you know, if you were to just do what's easy and fun for you and let yourself be good at it and fast at it.
603480	607480	It's like you you you work like barely at all.
607480	609480	Aside from not being fair.
609480	632480	Another thing that that would be is effeminate because it's like I have this masculine relationship, this faux Hemingway relationship with the idea of writing, like, oh, you've got to dig and make and decide and create and alter and and ultimately it's it's taking something
632480	644480	that should not be dichotomous, i.e. success and failure or kill or be killed or good or bad writing and it and turning it into that.
644480	650480	That's what you do when you're like competitive and petty and self loathing and about your work like, oh, I want to.
650480	652480	This is I'm writing shitty today.
652480	653480	Now I'm writing good.
653480	654480	This has to be the best.
654480	659480	And then you wonder why you take six months to write something that could take you three hours.
659480	665480	And it's because you're like you've decided to like get into a ring and like make everything about like combat.
665480	667480	And do you write every day?
667480	668480	Do you like?
668480	669480	No, no.
669480	670480	Do you do it?
670480	676480	But when you when you decide I'm going to write today, do you write like a couple of hours?
676480	677480	Do you write how long?
677480	683480	I mean, do you sit down and go, I'm going to do a marathon or do you do like ten minutes at a time?
684480	691480	Because the because I'll answer that question to the show after I turn in the script that I've been working on for way too long.
691480	692480	Right.
692480	694480	Because I want to answer that question honestly.
694480	707480	And if I answer it honestly, right now, the people that that that are that I've been torturing by sitting on this script like might just find me and shoot me because I know that that answer.
707480	710480	That's part of the thing that we dread is like, well, what page are you on?
710480	714480	What what what how long did you know, like what's it's like?
714480	723480	Yeah, if I if I was working six hours a day this entire time on this and focusing on it, of course, it would have been done by now.
723480	729480	I get I try to write every day.
729480	740480	But what I end up doing is I go to my spot, I open up my laptop and I stare at the computer for six to eight hours.
740480	745480	Then I close it up and then go, I can't work.
745480	747480	I'll start on it tomorrow.
747480	752480	So I'll do I and I'll be doing that for months and months and months.
752480	753480	Yeah.
753480	758480	I mean, believe me, I I'll maybe write like three sentences.
758480	765480	I mean, it used to be so much easier because I would write I would write because I would go, oh, I'm a shitty writer.
765480	767480	I'm just going to write a piece of shit.
767480	771480	And it was so much easier back then.
771480	772480	This is a good enough segue.
772480	781480	I mean, we could because we can talk with our guest about all the other crap, which is just like everyone else, just going like, holy shit, the world is exploding.
781480	783480	And we can talk about that with our guest.
783480	790480	But what a good segue because we have a woman writer, not a female writer.
790480	792480	That's a that's a callback to one of her pieces.
792480	806480	She's got if you go if you go to her website, Kara Brown dot com, you can see there's like a there's like a list of the shit she's written for Jezebel and and other sites and she has and blog entries and stuff.
806480	810480	And she's like, it's it's it's all really great stuff.
810480	813480	I'm looking forward to just making friends with her or chatting with her.
813480	815480	Please welcome Kara Brown.
822480	826480	Hello, I'm not good at greeting people.
826480	829480	I don't know if he's terrible at it.
829480	832480	Hello. Would you like some vodka?
832480	834480	Oh, man. You know, I'm getting over a cold.
834480	835480	So vodka helps that, right?
835480	836480	Yeah. Yeah.
836480	844480	And then it'll. Yeah. So digging digging into the ice with your with your.
844480	846480	That's a lot of ice. Yeah.
846480	849480	He uses all of that by the end of the show.
849480	851480	Yeah. Do you want me to pour it for you?
851480	852480	You know, like a gentleman.
852480	862480	Well, I'm a guest, you know, or am I going to read an article on Jezebel next week of why men need to stop pouring them in drinks?
862480	866480	You know, if I was still at Jezebel, it might be a concern.
866480	872480	We'll see. That's good. That was a that was a thank you.
872480	874480	You've also retired your shade court.
874480	878480	Oh, my gosh, you know about shade court because I went to your website.
878480	889480	So I was like looking through all your stuff that your voice was amazingly crisp and like.
889480	897480	Well, like like you literally have an entry that talks about this like angry black woman like stereotype and how people can't like.
897480	911480	And so it's it's it's hard to like you're a white guy and you're like you read stuff and you go like I want I want to let this person know that they're intimidating because that would be a good compliment.
911480	913480	But maybe not to.
913480	917480	No, I know. I know what you mean because I've gotten intimidating.
917480	923480	I think outside of the fact that I'm a black woman, like I know that I'm kind of like an intimidating person.
923480	926480	So I think you can I think you can divorce the two.
926480	928480	I am intimidating so you can say it.
928480	931480	I won't. I won't write about it tomorrow.
931480	934480	You say you have a you also have a pasta fetish.
934480	937480	You have a pasta.
937480	938480	I live at your website.
938480	939480	I was like, I think we'll probably get along.
939480	940480	I think this will be fine.
941480	944480	I make I make fresh pasta.
944480	947480	Fancy pasta, but yeah, I I do do that.
947480	955480	It was sort of a response, I think, to like I started early last year and I was like, this feels like it's going to be a long ass four years, hopefully.
955480	962480	And I I needed like some sort of I like it because it's a busy body type of hobby.
962480	969480	Like you you're doing something with your hands, but it doesn't necessarily require a lot of like brain power and you can watch TV or do something like that.
970480	972480	And then at the end you get to eat pasta.
972480	976480	So but you hate arugula and continues to make us.
978480	982480	I was so glad to see somebody just shit on arugula.
982480	983480	It's disgusting.
983480	988480	I'm so tired of people acting like it's like delicious.
988480	989480	It's everywhere, too.
989480	990480	They put it on everything.
990480	991480	Yeah, they won't.
991480	993480	They won't put it in the menu description.
993480	995480	By the way, we're going to put what you call scraggly ass.
995480	997480	What did you describe arugula?
997480	999480	I don't even remember that one.
999480	1000480	Craggly lettuce.
1000480	1001480	Yeah.
1001480	1005480	On top of your shit that's going to like taste like you got lost.
1005480	1006480	Yeah.
1006480	1010480	You know, when they give you like a side salad and they don't tell you arugula is in the side salad.
1010480	1011480	I hate that.
1011480	1012480	Yeah.
1013480	1016480	But the headline item is that you're a TV writer.
1016480	1019480	You were you on Blackish?
1019480	1022480	No, no, I actually went from Jezebel to Grownish.
1022480	1030480	Grownish is the spin off of Blackish.
1030480	1031480	Yes.
1031480	1045480	I honestly have not only seen clips of Blackish even though I did a panel with the creator and he's much more respectful to my work than obviously I am of his or toward his not of his because I haven't seen it.
1045480	1048480	But so I don't know.
1048480	1049480	Can you describe?
1049480	1053480	So Blackish is about a black family.
1053480	1054480	Gross.
1054480	1055480	I know, right.
1055480	1064480	Cosby show esque just in that it's like, you know, a well to do black family right now navigating all of that.
1064480	1070480	And in the show, the oldest daughter, her name is Zoe Johnson, played by Yara Shahidi.
1070480	1084480	And so our show is Yara going off to college conveniently, a different world esque and her her dealing with all of that and being in college right now and and all that bullshit.
1084480	1086480	So were you a different world fan?
1086480	1090480	I was I was a little young to watch it while it was on.
1090480	1093480	But later I would watch a different world.
1093480	1094480	Yeah.
1094480	1095480	And so you're way too young to.
1095480	1098480	Did you watch Cosby and like syndication or.
1098480	1099480	Yeah, I think. Yeah.
1099480	1100480	What was it?
1100480	1102480	What's your take as a modern millennial?
1102480	1103480	I'm assuming millennial.
1103480	1104480	I don't know.
1104480	1105480	Okay.
1105480	1110480	Like what's your take on the on the on the Huxtables as as a black family on television?
1110480	1114480	I mean, I love the Cosby show, I think, like everyone.
1114480	1115480	I actually still do.
1115480	1122480	I wrote about I wrote a piece about this recently where like in sort of the wake of all of this stuff that's happening and coming up.
1122480	1128480	Like for me, I may not fuck with Bill Cosby anymore, but it seems really disingenuous to act like I didn't.
1128480	1131480	I didn't love the Cosby show because it was wonderful.
1131480	1133480	And I get that for a lot of people.
1133480	1137480	It's tainted now, like understandably, and it could be difficult to watch.
1137480	1147480	But, you know, I'm not going to pretend like it wasn't amazing and like groundbreaking and that I didn't love seeing a family like that on television.
1147480	1153480	It sort of seems like I mean, especially at its at its high point when there were still only three or four networks,
1153480	1166480	there was a different game being played that we that we learned from now, which is that I'm always pointing out the Norman Lear philosophy, which is that we're not our goal is not to like.
1166480	1167480	Well, I don't know.
1167480	1179480	All I know is that Norman Lear was was was was like looking at himself and going, like, look, I don't I don't look like the family that I'm about to create a show for.
1179480	1183480	But if I don't, nobody will.
1183480	1189480	And then the syndrome will continue where people are watching television and seeing nobody that looks like them, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
1189480	1197480	And and so, like, it just seems like TV like we made a decision to worship it.
1197480	1201480	We made a decision, a decision that it wasn't even going to be about quality.
1201480	1202480	It's not art.
1202480	1207480	It was like it's like a barn raising or a church, you know, like we.
1207480	1211480	And so it that I watched the Cosby show every night.
1211480	1222480	And like I was it was it was like, you know, you would read in TV Guide this and that about the idea of it having something to do with blackness.
1222480	1228480	But the more important thing was that it was the Cosby show and it was it was the Huxtables and it was like always going to be amazing and funny.
1228480	1235480	And part of that was like listening to this like audience that may or may not have existed in the live studio, losing their fucking shit.
1236480	1244480	Because this episode is about, you know, it might come down to Bill Cosby, like making a face for his daughter to help her get over a cold or something.
1244480	1246480	And everyone's just pissing themselves.
1246480	1249480	And we just we just took part in it.
1249480	1251480	I don't know what my goddamn point is.
1251480	1255480	I'm having my very first like I'm a bad interviewer Vodka.
1255480	1257480	So it's not going to make me a good interviewer.
1257480	1270480	But like so what so your perspective on this, though, is like it's a little different, like because I'm I'm possibly 20 or more years older than you have no idea.
1270480	1271480	I'm not going to ask.
1273480	1279480	But like what do you what do you make of these shifting definitions?
1279480	1292480	Like as far as as far as white people are concerned, like your advice to them, like in terms of like, are you supposed to let's just start with the basic.
1292480	1299480	Are you supposed to recognize race or or this fantasy of being colorblind?
1299480	1301480	Like, let's get that colorblind.
1301480	1302480	Yeah, that's bad.
1302480	1307480	Like we tried that for like this tremendous amount of time.
1307480	1309480	And it just didn't.
1309480	1316480	Also, I don't want I don't know that colorblindness is sort of saying, like, just pretend everyone's white.
1316480	1319480	That's like kind of what people mean when they say colorblind.
1319480	1322480	And like, I don't want like I like being black.
1322480	1325480	So I don't need anyone to act like I'm not.
1325480	1329480	And I'm sure that other people of color like being whatever they are.
1329480	1333480	And so this is like people love being white because it seems incredible.
1333480	1338480	So I went into a library the other day and they said, you don't have to bring the books back.
1338480	1339480	Really?
1339480	1340480	Yeah, I was like, what?
1340480	1343480	They're like, they did this like gesture.
1343480	1346480	I was like, oh, and then there's a black guy behind me.
1346480	1347480	And they were like, this is overdue.
1347480	1350480	And he was like, well, I know that's how libraries work.
1350480	1354480	And the person, the librarian was like, I didn't know that's what they meant by.
1354480	1354480	
1354480	1355480	Anyway, sorry.
1358480	1360480	What is going on?
1360480	1361480	It's complicated.
1361480	1363480	I followed all of that.
1363480	1364480	Yeah.
1364480	1369480	But OK, so this is your this is your first step into TV, right?
1369480	1371480	From pros from essay.
1371480	1372480	Yes.
1372480	1374480	How did you get the job?
1374480	1375480	I got the job.
1375480	1378480	So I had been so I've been at Jezebel.
1378480	1381480	I actually like when I moved to L.A., I was living in New York.
1381480	1385480	I moved to L.A. with the intention of getting into TV writing.
1385480	1387480	And I had a really strong start at Jezebel.
1387480	1389480	So I kind of got distracted.
1389480	1391480	I was like, Ta-Nehisi Coates knows my name.
1391480	1393480	Who the fuck cares about TV?
1393480	1398480	And then Gawker filed for bankruptcy and I panicked.
1398480	1403480	And also, I think it clarified that ultimately what I was trying to do.
1403480	1408480	And so I had been working on a sample that I ended up finishing in like two weeks
1408480	1411480	out of just like sheer desperation and a friend.
1411480	1412480	He helped me edit it.
1412480	1415480	And then he actually he was wrapped.
1415480	1416480	He's wrapped at CIA.
1416480	1420480	They were having this comedy writer's boot camp kind of seminar thing.
1420480	1422480	And it was aimed towards women and people of color.
1422480	1425480	And so there were like panels and networking and whatever.
1425480	1428480	And so Issa Rae was one of the speakers.
1428480	1430480	And so I knew that she she followed me on Twitter.
1430480	1433480	And I was like, I know I think she knows who I am and has read my writing.
1433480	1436480	And so I went up to her and she immediately was like, oh, my God.
1436480	1437480	Hello.
1437480	1439480	Like I didn't know you were interested in TV.
1439480	1440480	And so she had her deal.
1440480	1441480	She has her deal with HBO.
1441480	1444480	And so she was looking for material.
1444480	1447480	And I was like, I literally have this one script.
1447480	1449480	And I sent it to her team.
1449480	1450480	And they're like, cool.
1450480	1451480	And they liked it.
1451480	1452480	And they sent it to HBO.
1452480	1455480	And then all of a sudden, I had a meeting with an Amy at HBO,
1455480	1456480	which meant nothing to me.
1456480	1458480	I was like, I don't know, guys.
1458480	1459480	I'm going up.
1459480	1460480	She's the head of comedy at HBO.
1460480	1462480	I had no idea.
1462480	1466480	And people, a bunch of people who didn't really give a shit before started to
1466480	1467480	give a shit.
1467480	1470480	So like, that's how I got my agents because like I had sort of been sending
1470480	1471480	things to friends and agencies.
1471480	1474480	And obviously, nobody cared until you had something going on.
1474480	1481480	And then I just spent the beginning of 2017 like doing all those
1481480	1483480	generals and that slog.
1483480	1487480	And then I had been going into ABC a lot.
1487480	1490480	And they kept being like, we think Kenya, Kenya Bears who created
1490480	1491480	Black-ish and created Grown-ish.
1491480	1493480	They're like, we think Kenya will like you.
1493480	1494480	We think Kenya will like you.
1494480	1498480	And I kind of had to wait until the show had been picked up.
1498480	1500480	He didn't like want to meet anyone until everything was ready.
1500480	1505480	And then I drove to Encino and we had coffee and then I got the job.
1505480	1506480	This is exciting.
1506480	1507480	Yeah.
1507480	1511480	Are you, are you, are you, so you're just, you're a staff writer
1511480	1515480	entering and like, are, what are, what are, well, and you can say, I don't
1515480	1519480	want to talk about this because I don't want to start my TV career, even
1519480	1520480	risking doing the right thing.
1520480	1523480	But I was just like curious, like, what are your, what are your nightmare
1523480	1526480	scenarios in your head when you think about the first day of school?
1527480	1530480	The thing is I had been working from home for three years.
1530480	1535480	So the idea of just interacting with humans all day was like, I, it was
1535480	1539480	all I need, like I was so desperate for human contact that it would have had
1539480	1543480	to have been such an unbelievable nightmare for me to have like been
1543480	1545480	unhappy with the setup.
1545480	1546480	So I don't know.
1546480	1550480	I just didn't really like, one of the things that I think has helped me is
1550480	1553480	there's a lot of stuff that I didn't really know, like in the same way that
1553480	1555480	I didn't really know who Amy was.
1555480	1558480	I was like, I don't know guys, like this will be fine.
1558480	1562480	And, um, because I didn't really know what to be afraid of.
1562480	1564480	I wasn't that afraid of things.
1564480	1567480	Which is most of the value in a staff writer.
1567480	1572480	I mean, like you're, this town runs on fresh blood from the Midwest.
1572480	1573480	By the way, where did you grow up?
1573480	1577480	I grew up in Seattle, Seattle, Washington.
1577480	1577480	
1577480	1580480	That naivete, Schwab and I are never going to get that back where we did
1580480	1583480	our best writing when we were probably how old you are.
1583480	1584480	I'm not going to ask.
1584480	1588480	Um, but we were like, we wrote this pilot called heat vision and jacket.
1588480	1589480	It might as well have been called.
1589480	1590480	We don't know how TV works.
1590480	1595480	Like, like we just, we just grew up watching it and we just like love the
1595480	1597480	idea of a talking motorcycle kind of thing.
1597480	1601480	It was like, like that naivete is, which is a bad word for it.
1601480	1604480	It's, it's, it's, it's not naivete.
1604480	1605480	No, I didn't.
1605480	1606480	I mean, there was so much stuff.
1606480	1609480	I didn't like when the scripts kept coming back in different colors and I
1609480	1612480	was like, I was like, I didn't want to ask anyone.
1612480	1615480	You know, like obviously I wasn't going to ask like, you know,
1615480	1616480	someone in charge.
1616480	1619480	And so I might've asked one of the writers assistants or I think I maybe
1619480	1620480	just figured it out.
1620480	1621480	It was like, Oh, it's a different draft.
1621480	1624480	It's a different draft when the scripts are in different color.
1624480	1627480	And I was like, Oh, it's purple today.
1627480	1628480	Does that mean I did bad?
1628480	1629480	Yeah.
1629480	1631480	I didn't really figure it out.
1631480	1633480	Um, yeah, I never knew.
1633480	1637480	I guess I kind of still don't know when because people will like make jokes
1637480	1641480	about, you know, in community, it was like, okay, we're on, we're on tears.
1641480	1645480	We're on tier three of like salmon.
1645480	1648480	We've been in triple, triple, triple blues.
1648480	1652480	We've definitely flipped the flip to the rainbow a couple of times with our
1652480	1653480	rewrites.
1653480	1655480	Like, what do you see when you go back to blue?
1655480	1659480	You, you just hope that by that time it's mathematically impossible that
1659480	1664480	there's a still blue pages left from the first time you had a meltdown.
1664480	1668480	If you've done that many rewrites, how can it be possible that there's
1668480	1670480	still first blue?
1670480	1674480	I think you, I think there is some kind of like, I, this is why writers
1674480	1679480	when that situation is happening, you're less concerned exactly which blue
1679480	1683480	pages you're looking at because it's like, we're fucking 12 days behind.
1683480	1684480	Yeah.
1684480	1688480	Well, I also, I also like it, it makes me wonder.
1688480	1689480	Yeah.
1689480	1692480	I always, I would never could tell because who's going to come up to me and
1692480	1697480	say, um, you know, there's way too many colors in the binder.
1697480	1698480	You know, it's fucking ridiculous.
1698480	1700480	I would always say, this is getting crazy.
1700480	1701480	Can we, can we repaginate?
1701480	1706480	Like, this is like, because they do this thing where the pages break because
1706480	1708480	they don't want the other page numbers to change.
1708480	1712480	So then you had the community would be like, you know, just turn the page.
1712480	1717480	And then Troy says, uh, Troy and Abed in the, and then you've turned the page
1717480	1719480	because I changed it to morning.
1719480	1727480	Um, anyways, the, uh, that's a, that's a, that's a reason why I, as much as I, I
1727480	1732480	understand that people who like tweet me or through other channels, like inquire
1732480	1734480	about the concept of a writer's assistant.
1734480	1739480	I know that the image in their head is like of a squire with like a quill, you
1739480	1744480	know, that he hands to Shakespeare when Shakespeare gets in a duel with, with
1744480	1745480	another writer.
1745480	1746480	And that happens.
1746480	1747480	It does.
1747480	1749480	It's just not the main part of the job.
1749480	1750480	Yeah, it's not, it's not.
1750480	1751480	I thank God.
1751480	1755480	I never had to be, I would have been, if I had had to come up and sort of like the
1755480	1759480	traditional, like a PA and then a writer's piano, I would have, I wouldn't, I
1759480	1761480	would have found a different career.
1761480	1762480	I'm not organized.
1762480	1767480	Like I find that job insane and they're so like, I would have, I wouldn't have
1767480	1769480	made it through a season of television.
1769480	1770480	Yeah, for sure.
1770480	1775480	I it's, it's, it's, it's legitimately, I guess, I guess I'm saying this, like,
1775480	1780480	it's a mind blower because what isn't it, but it's harder work than the, the, the
1780480	1781480	writing on the show.
1781480	1782480	We just sit around and talk.
1782480	1783480	Yeah.
1783480	1787480	And the fact that the writer's assistant is there means that what is already an
1787480	1791480	easier, easy job, which is going, what if a guy had a horse?
1791480	1796480	We now just like sit there and like vape and go, what if a guy had a horse?
1796480	1799480	And like, it's up to Tim to remember that we said it.
1799480	1800480	And yeah.
1800480	1804480	And a lot of those people are good writers.
1804480	1808480	It's not like, oh, those people are science brains, like they're clerical
1808480	1809480	thinkers.
1809480	1812480	Like they're, no, they're, they're, they're decent writers who go on to good
1812480	1813480	writing careers.
1813480	1817480	And, and, and then you look back and go, oh man, that poor fucking guy.
1817480	1818480	Yeah.
1818480	1819480	Anyways.
1819480	1820480	Couldn't have been me.
1820480	1823480	But well, let's talk about like fraud complex.
1823480	1828480	Have you, have you, is it, is it, is it different for you like at all?
1828480	1833480	Like you, you, you, you, when you leap from the pages of, of, of the
1833480	1838480	internets into, into a writer's room like that, do you ever like, are you
1838480	1842480	like, are you, are you plagued with anxiety about, I don't deserve this or
1842480	1843480	anything like that?
1843480	1847480	I mean, I think one of the things for me is that I had been writing
1847480	1849480	professionally for three years.
1849480	1851480	Like people were giving me money to write.
1851480	1854480	And also because it's the internet, I was getting a lot of feedback.
1854480	1858480	So I was like, I know I, like when I first wrote that, that script, I was
1858480	1862480	like, I know I'm not a shitty writer because like it would have, someone
1862480	1864480	would have figured it out over the course of the three years.
1864480	1867480	I don't know if I'm good at writing comedy scripts, but it's probably not
1867480	1871480	going to be super shitty because I'm not a super shitty writer.
1871480	1874480	Um, so it helped me in that regard.
1874480	1879480	But I mean, I feel like even now, um, like I just wrote, I wrote a cover
1879480	1883480	story for the fader on the singer SZA and it was the first feature like
1883480	1885480	profile I'd ever written.
1885480	1889480	And so I, when I finished the story, I was like, I think this is fine.
1889480	1891480	It was like, this is a fine story.
1891480	1895480	And the response has been much, people think it's much better than fine.
1895480	1898480	Um, but that's usually how I am with my writing.
1898480	1901480	So I, you know, even like when I was at Jezebel and I would write something,
1901480	1902480	I was like, this isn't that funny.
1902480	1904480	And then the commenters like are finding it really funny.
1904480	1908480	So I know that my standard is different.
1908480	1911480	Um, so I think it, it, and I kind of knew that.
1911480	1915480	So I was like, even if I think this is fine, I think other people think
1915480	1916480	it's better than that.
1916480	1919480	So I wasn't as nervous about that.
1919480	1920480	Um, but I don't know.
1920480	1922480	It's like, also it's funny.
1922480	1923480	Like my dad says this.
1923480	1925480	I lived in Dallas, Texas until I was seven.
1925480	1929480	And so my dad talked about when he was raising me and my sister.
1929480	1932480	Um, my mom was there too, but he tells the story.
1932480	1934480	Um, and he's like, I really raised,
1934480	1937480	tried to make sure that you had a lot of self-esteem because I didn't want
1937480	1941480	to raise like a little black girl in the South to not have a lot of self-esteem
1941480	1943480	because there were probably a lot of things that would crush that.
1943480	1947480	And so, and then his punchline is that like he went too far.
1947480	1952480	Um, I think that's never been a real big problem for me.
1952480	1958480	Um, yeah, my mom made it very, very clear that I could do anything I wanted.
1958480	1964480	And I, I, I, at 45, I sometimes like, I now I'm entering an age where I'm like,
1964480	1966480	I'm like, what if she was lying?
1966480	1969480	Like, and then I'm like, well, too late.
1969480	1970480	Yeah.
1970480	1971480	Like everybody else wanted.
1971480	1972480	The idea, right?
1972480	1973480	Like that.
1973480	1976480	I mean, it is like, when we talk about, cause I've always, I, I,
1976480	1978480	I've always used the example when I'm like, I'm panels and stuff.
1978480	1982480	It's like, you know, being a, being a, like a, like a guy that like wishes he
1982480	1986480	could, you know, in some regard, as far as doing the right thing with a job that
1986480	1993480	is very like cake, like not a cakewalk, but a, um, an honor, a privilege, like,
1993480	1996480	um, a rare like thing to, to come by this job.
1996480	2001480	Like I, my white guilt and stuff and like, like always makes me, what am I
2001480	2005480	supposed to do to like, like, like take my little piece of the, of the industry
2005480	2009480	and like try to like make sure I left it a little better than I, than I came
2009480	2010480	into it.
2010480	2016480	And the metaphor that I've constantly used is, is like the problem isn't that,
2016480	2018480	you know, we can talk about representation of the writers and all these
2018480	2022480	things, but like we've, the syndrome ends the day.
2022480	2030480	Like a black girl in sixth grade right now is watching TV and going like, oh,
2030480	2037480	I, I, I think I'll try writing that, which I just don't think it was in, in when
2037480	2042480	I was your age, probably I won't ask the, I think that I don't think that that
2042480	2043480	was even a remote.
2043480	2045480	And it was like, that's what we talk.
2045480	2048480	I think that's what we're getting at when we talk about this, this systemic,
2048480	2052480	like, yeah, problems that are, that are now, we're not going to pretend that
2052480	2056480	they're ending, but that, that, that we noticed that the, the actual like
2056480	2058480	profound changes are coming in the form of show running.
2059480	2060480	Yeah.
2060480	2064480	I mean, Shonda rhymes was like when I first watched Grey's Anatomy and then,
2064480	2067480	cause you know, sent in Seattle and so we're like, we're going to watch the
2067480	2068480	show.
2068480	2071480	Um, and then when I saw a picture of her for the first time, cause like you
2071480	2075480	don't see to the show runner, you know, unless it's, um, so the first time I
2075480	2079480	saw a picture of her and I was like, oh my God, like this black, Shonda rhymes
2079480	2080480	could be like an old Jewish guy.
2080480	2084480	It's kind of like, Shonda, we're going for lunch.
2084480	2086480	I'm working on the rewrites.
2087480	2088480	Like could have been.
2088480	2091480	And then I saw the picture and I was like, I think that was like, that was a
2091480	2093480	very important thing for me.
2093480	2095480	Like, oh, she's doing this.
2095480	2098480	Um, and that, that person exists and is doing this.
2098480	2099480	It's a job.
2099480	2100480	It's a job you can do.
2100480	2105480	It's like, like, like I, yeah, I just think, and I, it's not, I, I was just,
2105480	2108480	you know, like I go to the extreme place with like little black girl, like that
2108480	2113480	image, but it's like little kids in general, but here in lies the problem.
2113480	2118480	Now, like in terms of your biography too, we'll segue into that because I
2118480	2124480	always feel like then, but we can't tell people to take a shot at this job.
2124480	2125480	It would, it's there.
2125480	2127480	Part of that is extremely irresponsible.
2127480	2131480	It would be more responsible to tell somebody to try being a doctor because
2131480	2138480	there's like definitive milestones, scholarships, tests, a million chances
2138480	2143480	for you to, uh, for, for you and I, as somebody who might say to somebody,
2143480	2144480	you should be a writer.
2144480	2147480	Like, like for us to have sent that person on a path to hell.
2147480	2148480	Yeah.
2148480	2152480	It, it seems like something, I don't know, like I've, one of the things I hate
2152480	2156480	is when someone like wins an award, like an, you know, and they're up there and
2156480	2158480	they're like, follow your dreams.
2158480	2159480	You can do anything.
2159480	2161480	It's like, are you good at that thing though?
2161480	2164480	Because you shouldn't be telling people who are bad at some, like you at a
2164480	2169480	certain point, you know, I think you have an inkling of like, can I do this?
2169480	2171480	Is this really like, is this possible?
2171480	2172480	Do I believe in myself?
2172480	2173480	Whatever.
2173480	2176480	And like, I don't think you should be like, I think that's an important thing to
2176480	2177480	remember.
2177480	2181480	But also we got to be honest, like even a lower middle-class white guy like
2181480	2186480	myself, I think like there is a support system there.
2186480	2191480	I mean, I was borrowing money from my mom for, you know, well into my twenties.
2192480	2197480	And like my mom was like, yeah, you, you look like a comedian.
2197480	2198480	You look like a writer.
2198480	2202480	You know, here's another three grand for, you know, what really turned out to be
2202480	2203480	cocaine and weed.
2204480	2211480	Like, like, but like it was like, it, I can't fathom that that exists in, in, in
2212480	2217480	the neighborhoods that, that would, that it would be important for that to be
2217480	2220480	because it's like, but that's where my brain turns into a balloon animal.
2220480	2225480	Cause I'm like, you can't tell a poor kid, like a dirt poor kid.
2225480	2227480	Um, yeah, you should go to, you should try being a writer.
2227480	2229480	You can, you, your dreams, you can do anything.
2229480	2231480	It's like, no, we can't.
2231480	2232480	Yeah.
2232480	2238480	I mean, and like I, in a lot of ways, like my, when I was living in New York, I
2238480	2243480	was working in PR and I had, um, I was just like blogging all the time.
2243480	2246480	And so Jezebel had offered me an editorial fellowship.
2246480	2249480	So that was a job that was at the time it was part time minimum wage.
2249480	2252480	And it was something where like, if I had asked my parents for help, they
2252480	2255480	would have, if I was like, this is my dream, they would have, they would have
2255480	2257480	helped me, they would have supported me.
2257480	2259480	And I, and I knew that I had that as an option.
2259480	2264480	Um, but I also was just like, I don't want to ask them for help for something
2264480	2267480	that I'm not like, Oh, this is, this is like the dream.
2267480	2268480	Right.
2268480	2272480	Um, I like to save my big favors for, you know, when like I really need it.
2272480	2274480	And I was like, I don't know if I need this bad enough.
2274480	2276480	Um, I also want to lower my $3,000 number.
2276480	2279480	That was me adjusting for like Trump dollars.
2279480	2283480	Um, uh, you know, my, that was like a hundred dollars.
2283480	2286480	I never got, I never got more than you can get out of an ATM from my mom.
2286480	2289480	No, but like, I definitely spent it all on Coke and weed.
2289480	2291480	Like, so it really wasn't privilege.
2291480	2293480	Like I didn't spend it on a typewriter.
2293480	2294480	Right.
2294480	2295480	Um, but yeah.
2295480	2298480	And also I want to put another asterisk on something I said, because if they're
2298480	2301480	it's like, like I said, like, no, no, they can't, they can't.
2301480	2304480	It's like, well, no, I mean, it's not as easy.
2304480	2305480	There's no equivalent.
2305480	2309480	And if you don't know anyone, like one of the, the most helpful things for me
2309480	2313480	is when I moved to LA and I started meeting TV writers and I was like, oh,
2313480	2315480	these people are not that impressive.
2315480	2319480	Surely I can figure this out if these dumb, dumb figured it out.
2319480	2323480	And like, I think that was really important to like realize that like, oh,
2323480	2324480	these are just regular.
2324480	2329480	Most of them are regular people doing this, but like, if you don't live in LA
2329480	2332480	and you're not around those people, I have no idea how you would figure that
2332480	2335480	out. Like it seems like this mythical unreachable thing.
2335480	2340480	Yeah. It's difficult to figure out when the actual empire that is the
2340480	2346480	geographically located Hollywood will just bottom out because it seems by a
2346480	2350480	logical assessment that it's a total non-necessity anymore.
2350480	2353480	And we know that people are shooting things in Portland and Vancouver and,
2353480	2354480	and all over.
2354480	2357480	And that as a city, a city going broke now,
2357480	2360480	a great way for them is to give tax incentives and say, come shoot here and
2360480	2361480	we will do it.
2361480	2364480	So you keep, I keep wondering like, why are we here?
2364480	2365480	What's going on?
2365480	2368480	But it, that's one thing that hasn't changed in 50 years.
2368480	2369480	It's like, oh yeah,
2369480	2375480	you moved to LA and you get a drink and a bar and you are immediately gaining
2375480	2380480	some kind of advantage over someone who's in Minneapolis aspiring to,
2380480	2381480	to write one day.
2381480	2383480	Cause you're just, it's just erosion.
2383480	2386480	It's just, it's just like, you're, you're going to run into somebody.
2386480	2388480	You're going to overhear jokes.
2388480	2391480	You're going to like, you're, you're just, you're just getting desensitized to
2391480	2395480	what is otherwise an impossibly mythical kingdom.
2395480	2396480	And you're right.
2396480	2398480	It's just a bunch of normal morons.
2398480	2401480	You know, like we're just, we're just piddling around out here.
2401480	2406480	Like we're, we're plumbers that, that, that didn't have to qualify for anything.
2406480	2409480	We don't even have to, because you keep, there's no bar.
2409480	2410480	You really have to.
2410480	2413480	Yeah. Like you can't prove that the toilet is leaking in writing.
2413480	2417480	You can, you can say it, but we can also go, I think you have bad taste.
2418480	2420480	I don't think you really understand what a toilet is, sir.
2423480	2427480	But, but yeah, specifically like class wise, where would you place yourself
2427480	2428480	growing up?
2428480	2431480	I mean, my dad, my dad worked at Microsoft.
2431480	2434480	That's why he grew up in Seattle, but we moved back.
2434480	2437480	So like, you know, I went to, I went to a private school.
2437480	2439480	I went to a private university.
2439480	2443480	So like, I, you know, I don't, I had a lot of friends.
2443480	2446480	I had a lot of friends that were like very wealthy.
2446480	2449480	And so I knew we weren't that, but I was like, we're fine.
2449480	2454480	So I didn't, you know, we weren't like, but life was nice.
2454480	2455480	For sure.
2455480	2458480	What do you think shrubs thinking over there?
2458480	2460480	How, how, how was growing up for you?
2460480	2462480	It was all right.
2462480	2464480	It was okay.
2464480	2471480	I lived in a small town and I drew a lot and I've made like stop motion animated
2471480	2472480	movies.
2472480	2473480	That's fun.
2473480	2477480	Shrobs hometown, Mayville, Wisconsin, there's a billboard outside of it.
2477480	2481480	You know, like, like how towns have signs that with logos and slogans and
2481480	2482480	things.
2482480	2487480	And Mayville was, was the last stop where you could get like supplies.
2487480	2491480	If you're going to go to a place called Horicon, which is like duck hunting
2491480	2492480	territory.
2492480	2493480	Okay.
2493480	2496480	And, and so that was like a big thing for a town of that size.
2496480	2501480	So the, the sign outside of Rob's hometown says, welcome to Mayville gateway
2501480	2502480	to the marsh.
2502480	2503480	Yeah.
2503480	2504480	Wow.
2504480	2505480	Yeah.
2505480	2506480	Wow.
2506480	2507480	And one.
2507480	2508480	I'm so jealous of that.
2508480	2509480	I know.
2509480	2510480	I know.
2510480	2515480	And then one, one, there was like a time where McDonald's except I come from
2515480	2521480	like a 3000, 5000 population town and they, we had a McDonald's in town and
2521480	2522480	that was a big deal.
2522480	2529480	And McDonald's gave us a sign that said with Ronald McDonald on it.
2529480	2531480	And it said Mayville gateway to the March.
2531480	2533480	Oh, Ron McDonald was on that sign.
2533480	2537480	Hey, we own you now.
2537480	2538480	That's hilarious.
2538480	2541480	It's like Adderall giving you a defibrillator.
2541480	2546480	But they, but the town wasn't big enough and they went, they closed down
2546480	2549480	McDonald's and they took the sign away.
2549480	2552480	They took the sign away.
2552480	2558480	I guess they didn't want to get sued by somebody who was like, look, I'm, I
2558480	2560480	have reverse diabetes.
2560480	2566480	I need, I needed a, a, a Big Mac and you made me think I could get one here.
2566480	2568480	I was expecting a McDonald's.
2568480	2570480	I'm suing you for all your duck ammunition.
2570480	2574480	And then they took, they, they turned the McDonald's that they was bought and
2574480	2576480	turned it to a mom and pop burger shop.
2576480	2578480	And it was called bumpy burgers.
2578480	2580480	That's maybe better.
2580480	2581480	Right.
2581480	2582480	Bumpy.
2582480	2583480	I don't know.
2583480	2587480	Mom and pop, you know, that seems on, on brand for what this town sounds like.
2587480	2588480	To me.
2588480	2589480	Yeah.
2589480	2590480	It's grown.
2590480	2591480	It's grown ish done for its season.
2591480	2592480	You do.
2592480	2593480	You're finishing the whole season.
2593480	2594480	Yeah.
2594480	2595480	We finished.
2595480	2596480	We got it.
2596480	2597480	Are we done with me?
2597480	2598480	Oh yeah.
2598480	2599480	I move around.
2599480	2600480	I stir.
2600480	2601480	Okay.
2601480	2602480	I'm a good host.
2602480	2603480	All right.

2632480	2636520	Cause then you get to do a thing, but like there's there, right.
2636520	2642480	I'm very excited about, uh, what do you mean you're not allowed to talk about it?
2643480	2648480	What's the worst that's going to happen if you start talking about it?
2648480	2649480	It'll be fine.
2649480	2650480	I don't, I don't know.
2650480	2656480	I just know like people like to try and see I've, I've, I've, I've tried.
2656480	2662920	I've done my 20 years of seeing what the worst that could happen is if I say stuff and you're
2662920	2663920	still here.
2663920	2664920	I know.
2664920	2669840	So Kevin Smith just said to me, uh, when I was talking to him, he's like, cause he's

2701560	2705840	Um, anyone's wearing a table.

2716800	2717800	A list.
2717800	2719200	Emmys are on tomorrow.

2728200	2734000	Um, uh, the Royal tomorrow, I just wanted to finish my little, my little, my little,
2734000	2737600	I was talking about bumpy burgers and you moved on.
2737600	2739600	What was so great about what happened there?
2739600	2740800	We had something.
2740800	2746800	We were talking about, they had something, something patronizing you.
2746800	2748000	You don't know that.
2748000	2749600	I was interested.
2749600	2749800	Okay.
2749800	2750500	Thank you.
2750500	2753100	Well, you know, I have a weird form of burger.
2753100	2755500	I'll give you two more minutes on bumpy burgers.
2755500	2757500	No, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
2758700	2759300	Okay.
2760100	2760500	I was good.
2760500	2764100	I'm, you know, I like to move around, you know, organically.
2765100	2765500	Yeah.
2765500	2766300	You got a second.
2766300	2770400	Anyways, by the way, my little joke, I now I have to call it a joke and then I have to
2770400	2772100	tell it and it's just like, this is the worst.
2772100	2774200	I was going to say this look, I was going to say, what?
2774200	2775100	No, I do.
2775200	2776400	I do have to.
2778000	2779000	I'm not stopping you.
2779000	2782900	Please do the LA story where she has to finish the shave and a haircut on the
2782900	2786900	tuba like, you know, but did she have to?
2787700	2791300	That's why I laughed at it because I knew she had to.
2791300	2792100	I got it.
2792100	2794400	I knew she had to finish her shave and a haircut.
2794400	2796400	I don't remember this.
2797500	2797900	I'm not going to.
2797900	2798100	Okay.
2798100	2799200	I'm not going to finish my joke.
2799500	2801100	I didn't want you to not finish it.
2801400	2801800	You know what?
2801800	2802400	It wasn't a joke.
2802400	2803900	It was just a stupid turn of phrase.
2803900	2804600	It was just dumb.
2804600	2807700	I wasn't even I was making it up as I went and it's just, but I don't like getting
2807700	2813700	interrupted, but it's like, well, then why do I have a show if I don't like getting
2813700	2814000	interrupted?
2814000	2814500	What's going on?
2814500	2814800	You know what?
2814800	2815300	I would do it.
2815300	2816600	Are we on a pirate ship?
2816600	2818500	Why is everything creaking?
2818500	2819700	We are taking on water.
2820200	2823700	If I didn't want to get interrupted, you know, what I do is just never talk.
2824100	2824500	Yeah.
2827200	2829100	Well, that's why it works for me, right?
2829700	2832300	You could be a man that helps also.
2832400	2833200	Oh, yeah.
2834400	2836500	But what do you what are your aspirations?
2836500	2843100	Because do you know, I mean, you have to you have to wait and see are you is your job a
2843100	2845900	guarantee on season two or do you just wait and like here?
2845900	2847300	No, I'm pretty sure.
2847500	2847800	Yeah.
2850700	2856700	The glimmer in the eye was that you have to pay $5 a month to see that the true confidence
2856700	2858700	of a staff writer that nailed it.
2860000	2862400	Yeah, I think you're looking at a story editor.
2862400	2866300	Well, that's cool.
2866300	2876600	But and then and then like long mid mid midterm ambitions like like if if Grown-ish keeps going
2876600	2878500	for years and years and years.
2878500	2886500	Do you see yourself, you know, gaining more levels in that or do you are you chomping at
2886500	2887700	champing at the bit too?
2888400	2890300	I'm champing at the bit.
2890300	2890900	I changed it.
2890900	2892600	Champagne, she went to private school.
2892600	2894800	So it's she knows it's champion.
2895500	2899300	But champion sounds wrong because everyone says chomping, right?
2899300	2900100	They don't know.
2900400	2903400	It's just like fort instead of forte.
2903400	2905100	Yes, exactly.
2905100	2906500	Like shit drives me nuts.
2907300	2908000	Yeah.
2909100	2910800	Drives me nuts too.
2912000	2916000	Let's you go draw something draw a cube in perspective.
2918000	2920200	Do you guys remember that game draw something?
2920300	2922200	You played it on your phone with friends.
2922200	2923500	That was yeah, I was pretty addicted.
2923500	2924300	I was the best.
2924300	2929000	The only time I would ever lose is when it was Asterix, which is like some fucking cartoon
2929000	2931400	character in Deutschland or something.
2931900	2934700	And it's just like it's not a real word.
2934700	2937700	So how could you guess something that's a made-up word?
2937700	2938800	You could never guess that.
2939400	2941000	Anyway, you ever play that game?
2941000	2944500	I don't know what it I don't know what it's called because I've only it's just like a it's
2944500	2949600	not like a thing you buy at Toys R Us but it's like a game where you it's like a party
2949600	2955400	game where you everyone writes a phrase and then you pass the stack of papers and then
2955400	2961900	you look at the phrase and then you draw crossword the and then you pass that it's like a telephone
2961900	2963200	game that comes back around to you.
2963200	2968300	So you write Ghostbusters on the top sheet and then you hand it off and you get like putting
2968300	2972800	pops or whatever and you and you write which you try to draw putting pops because that's
2972800	2973600	what you're reading.
2973600	2977800	You got it wrong and I didn't know if you're past putting pop.
2978800	2983900	I want anyways it comes back around and you've got you you're like well, I I wrote Ghostbusters
2983900	2988200	and then this is how Amanda drew Ghostbusters and because that's what she drew.
2988200	2991900	This is what the next person wrote and then it's kind of it's really fun.
2991900	2996900	Oh, I get I have not played but I there are other movies besides Ghostbusters that you
2996900	2997700	can write down.
2997700	2999000	Yeah, putting pops.
3000800	3005300	Yeah, I haven't seen that Ghostbusters was we tried our friend KK was so drunk that we
3005400	3011100	were like this is always a one drunk person in the game that like either ruins it or makes
3011100	3014800	it like worth playing depending on how you look at it.
3014800	3020400	But like my friend Dino just wrote Ghostbusters is like it's a movie with a logo even if you
3020400	3026400	drop badly than the next personal and then it went through KK and it was like it came
3026400	3031800	out as like this like there were guys like pointing things at a giant peanut and it was
3031800	3035000	crying and it's just such a great game.
3035000	3038400	Because then the next person is like a giant peanut and then you're like you have to
3038400	3043400	ask so we should make a phone version of it or we should we should we should we should
3043400	3049000	have a society that effectively reproduces the effects so that by the 21st century we're
3049000	3049700	almost dead.
3049700	3051100	Let's talk about politics a little bit.
3051100	3053000	You're you're a you're a millennial.
3053000	3055900	What are you hopeful or are you like stocking canned goods?
3056300	3059800	I you know actually so one of the one of the writers in our room.
3059800	3064800	She was telling us how she and her husband had just bought gas masks and was like condensing
3064800	3065800	everyone to go buy a gas mask.
3065800	3066600	So I was like okay.
3066600	3070600	So I went to Amazon and they were like 80 bucks which is like a little more than I felt
3070600	3074200	like it had been like 45 or 50.
3075400	3083100	What like say a friend of yours had an extra gas mask and you wanted to try it out.
3083100	3083900	Oh God.
3083900	3089900	Well, would you be like a cheapy peepy if you know what it made me realize that I didn't
3089900	3092500	want to spend if I was only to spend $80 on a gas mask.
3092500	3096000	I was like I think if I need a gas mask I'd like to be dead.
3096600	3097600	I was like I don't want to be here.
3097600	3099000	You have to run around gas masks.
3099000	3100900	I hope I go out and the for I don't want.
3100900	3101600	I don't want to have to.
3101600	3102700	You're going to breathe it in.
3102700	3106100	You're going to be like I just want to breathe it and then I'll go.
3106100	3110700	My only thought about that's how I feel about a nuclear strike like I'm not going to get
3110700	3118600	in the car and head for a print of that so that I can have half a face for 10 years.
3119100	3124200	I'm just I'm going to like run to the impact point and like try to catch the missile in
3124200	3128800	my teeth because I want to like die in a flash but gas mask.
3128800	3129700	I don't know.
3129700	3135700	I don't want because the way you die by things that that kill you by inhaling them make you
3135700	3136600	suffer.
3136800	3140900	I want to I might buy a gas mask so I can make it to my gun.
3142100	3143200	I don't have a gun.
3143600	3143900	I don't know.
3143900	3145400	I was like I don't have enough stuff.
3145400	3147500	I bought a gun when Trump got elected.
3147500	3148100	Did you?
3148600	3151400	I don't I just feel like that is part of the problem.
3151400	3151800	It's part.
3151800	3152400	No, it's not.
3152400	3152600	Wait.
3152600	3158400	Fragility is it is I've realized it all now, but I still got the gun.
3158400	3162000	What did you what did you think you would need the gun for?
3162000	3163400	Like what what made you like?
3163400	3166900	What did you think would happen to shoot his dogs weirdly now?
3166900	3170100	Well, there's that I mean, it's always talking about shooting his dogs these days.
3170100	3176600	Really really really don't put a nickel in him really every day.
3176600	3181200	He's like I got to show you can shoot you're going to shoot your two dogs.
3182200	3186700	Well, I don't I don't want to derail this but like at the end of the world if I'm about to kill myself,
3186700	3191600	I don't want my dogs to well, I guess they I guess they could eat me and there's a I guess I could leave
3191600	3198200	them to eat me and they'd have a couple days of ground Chuck to have fun with I but like I was just
3198200	3203600	thinking like I'll just kill you know, everybody that loves me that needed context, but but no,
3203600	3204700	it's not for suicide.
3204700	3206800	It's for it was for the gun.
3206800	3213500	The gun was definitely overall the most accurate description of it, which is my new favorite phrase
3213500	3214800	because they're just like holy shit.
3214800	3217500	What a wake-up of like is that like white fragility.
3217500	3226000	It was like I have never had this level of experience unlike basically all women all people of color all people
3226000	3233000	of any identifiable demographic as a vanilla man with while I thought I was an underdog and I thought
3233000	3233900	I was bad-ass.
3233900	3235400	I thought I was punk rock.
3235400	3242100	I thought I was an anarchist as in let's bring the anarchy like like like and then like I saw my girlfriend
3242100	3248900	crying after an election and I was like I can't stop crying, you know, and like and that's why you bought
3248900	3255000	the guys didn't yeah, he's like stop crying and and and and and and then and then and then the waitress came
3255000	3261100	over and she had been crying and then the women were hugging and then and I was like and I'm like talking
3261100	3265800	to the other guys and going like but then but then I got to shoot my dogs.
3266300	3267800	I got to go right now.
3267800	3270700	It was like shoot my dog.
3270800	3273200	Now we've come back to I'm convinced of it again.
3273200	3280200	Like I'm back to like yeah, it's happening again, but but in the days after the election, I was like this is
3280200	3290000	happening fast and by this I mean unidentifiable total destabilization like how hard is it going to be
3290000	3300600	for a guy that can the first guy to go out of business in Las Vegas owning a casino like like how hard
3300600	3310100	is it going to be for this guy with an already unstable global economy to to just like provoke a polarity
3310100	3313100	shift that just crumbles everything.
3313100	3318500	I didn't even think at the time of like oh, you know, these racists are going to start clockwork orangeing
3318500	3323600	and then everyone's going to like it mad and now what I'm scared of is that the Mueller report is going to
3323600	3329600	come out and it's like we already know like he's got it's going to be he's a criminal and now we have a
3329600	3336000	constitutional crisis and then it's going to be I'm genuinely like just as a just a fan theory civil war is
3336000	3342400	going to because like it's going to be Street to Street like fighting people going like and so but my the
3342400	3351200	reason I got the gun is because I'm like it's a power tool right that I don't have that like a flashlight is
3351200	3361400	for an earthquake and and a drill is for making a bird feeder and and and I don't have one of those things that
3361400	3369000	knocks the people down that saw your sparklets bottles like I that that if I didn't have a girlfriend, I don't
3369000	3375400	know if I because I'd be like, well, what am I tech savory? I'm going to like like like enjoy protecting my empty gun
3375400	3387000	with its last 11 bullets. I you're going to draw a droopy dog. I it's a home invasion white fragility like fear of
3387000	3395700	impotence like like like like the worst death in the world would be not being able to protect my loved ones like
3395700	3401700	that's and then it's like there's this product and it's like I'm exactly the part of the problem. That's why everyone has a
3401700	3410400	gun. Yeah, I mean I I've I remember right after the election and I was talking to my dad like I was sobbing and I was
3410400	3415100	talking to my dad or I think it was a couple days later. It was probably still sobbing and I asked how my grandmother
3415100	3423200	was my 85 year old grandmother and he was like she seems fine and I was like, oh, yeah, like she used to like they used
3423200	3431400	to just like black people walk down the street and then you just never saw them again. And so part of it was like when I
3431400	3437200	she and I talked to her and she was like, yeah, no, I hate him. This is terrible. Also, she's like old. So I think also at
3437200	3446400	that point you're like, I don't know whatever. She's like ice on a porch could be my Donald Trump. But I did think about
3446400	3456200	that. I was like, you know, it's it's been worse. So like it there's that. But I've also had to like, I don't know, like I've
3456200	3460600	had to really narrow the shit that I can like really, really care about because I feel like all this other stuff takes so
3460600	3466600	much energy just to like absorb it and want it and like I don't want to ignore it. And so I've had to be like, there's like
3466600	3472000	five things I can care about in a real way. And then I have to like pay attention to all this other shit because it feels
3472000	3478900	necessary to pay attention because there's so much and even now I'm like, I don't even there's shit that I don't like names
3478900	3485900	that I see and I don't really I know that it's like a bad thing or there's a, you know, scandal, but I don't really know what it
3485900	3500200	is. So as a millennial, I feel I weirdly actually feel I feel okay, going into the midterms. I feel very like just just okay,
3500200	3507400	though, like not on either side of it, just like really solidly. Okay. And I think it's just because like, I have to feel okay.
3507400	3514400	Otherwise, like it's just because the alternative is going like, because I went through that phase where I was like, these guys
3514400	3523300	are all acting like there aren't going to be free and fair elections in 2018. They still kind of are. But now it's and I'm not I'm not
3523300	3528900	arguing. I'm not saying I'm still willing to believe in the worst nightmare bar. Yeah. But now there's this other theory, because the
3528900	3538400	behaviors become so incredibly like clownish that I'm like, Oh, maybe they are just they just thought they just they're just dumb.
3538800	3547500	Like, I know they're they're always dumb, but like not dumb and knew something that I didn't. Like maybe they're just idiots. I think most
3547500	3557000	of the people who knew stuff seem like they're kind of gone. Like it feels like mostly idiots left. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like the people
3557000	3564700	that knew stuff were like, oh, this shit we knew the jig is up. We can't leave a paper trail like and he's just like, you're fired.
3564700	3572900	You're fired. You're fired. And it's like, those are all the people that were like, either a just want to say, I don't think this might be illegal
3573000	3580500	later. And or the people that were like, we should do this illegal thing, like both categories of people. That's a really interesting way of
3580500	3587800	looking at it. Like he's like, he's just but is that like, it's just this absurd thing about like, he's just like the you're fired guy.
3587800	3595200	And now he's just you're firing. It's like, like, could you become Caesar that way? Could you just fire every Roman senator and then fire the
3596100	3604200	executive branch and fire that? Oh, wait, no, that's me. Okay. I'll hire I'll promote the executive branch. I'm going to fire this the fire, the
3604200	3611400	Constitution. Like, is he just going to fire? I'm sure he I bet you he thinks he can like fire a Supreme Court judge. Firing is the only thing
3611400	3620400	he's ever done. Yeah, that my dad would call running a business. Like my dad, who's like an actual businessman, like, like, I think that's the only thing
3620400	3632000	he's ever done. That was like, I bet he's never filed taxes or like checked, cashed a check or like put balance the ledger or or like looked at a pie chart, like, but
3632000	3643800	he's just he's just fired people. He's just he thinks it's just like anyways. Well, I think if I think if we can, I think if after the midterms, I don't feel like I feel like talk to me again
3643800	3654300	after that. Yeah, because if I still feel this shitty, like next January, then it's like, in assuming maybe we flipped things, then it's like, oh, we're super fucked.
3654300	3665700	So yeah, but you'll have made a lot of pasta by then. I've made a lot of pasta by then. I will. That's got to be you think that's a thing that's like a phenomenon in America is like people have these
3665700	3675200	Trump hobbies. They're like, if it's going to be four years, I might as well take up bonsai tree farming or like something. I think and people gained a lot of weight apparently after the election.
3675200	3686800	They were just like, I stayed home for weeks. Yeah, I put on a lot of weight. And then in 2018, and I was like, I got to start working out and also buying. I think I think absolutely like everybody like that's why I started.
3686800	3693500	We're all going to there's going to be like some equivalent of the baby boom. But instead of just being a population explosion, it's going to be like a weird hobby explosion.
3693500	3704400	Like like, how come there's so many more stamp collectors that are aged 40 in 2030? Well, because it traces back to this panic people had that they were missing out on the smaller things in life.
3704400	3720400	All these CrossFit gyms like every day I seen in one of those. That's probably the response. Yeah, I mean, there seems I don't know the people I know that go to gym say that the drop off that happens at the beginning of the year hasn't really happened so far, which is interesting. I don't know.
3720400	3731800	Do you want to meet my my black friend that has your last name? Oh, yeah, I might know him. Oh, yeah. Did you did you meet him before the show? Or did you do you might do? No, I just, you know, we said you guys all know each other.
3731800	3756200	You know, it's fun. You know, it's shitty. Okay, I'm gonna say this, because it's like, we don't all black people don't, but it's hard because like in Hollywood, I'm learning like, I have met, I'm gonna say, probably 60%. Well, in Hollywood. And I haven't even been doing it that long. I mean, just cuz there's not that many. And so it's one of those things where I'm like, Yeah, I do know that person. And I don't want to tell you that because you're asking me.
3756200	3775320	I have that conversation constantly now, because I'm not all it's almost like a social customer. I'm not allowed to I have to I go like, Oh, Asian person, do you know Randall park? And they're like, of course, I know Randall parking. I figured you did, but I'm not allowed to write. All right, well, let's bring up the mortgage Brown. No relation.
3787200	3813680	Brown, down, down, down, down, down, down to march brown, sit down, down to march Brown sitting down down to the morge. That was me. That was great. Keep your freestyle short like little little punctuation. And you're like, you get through him. What's going on? I'm all right.
3813680	3831200	Yeah, what else was Mayville like? Anything new? Not similar, just working, working, working, working, working. We don't know each other, by the way. Okay. We don't know each other. But now we do, so. Yeah. Uh oh. Do you want to share any of your work?
3831200	3859200	Uh, my stuff personally, I'm just still writing really weird sort of shorts. Um, it's a weird thing where it's like Fela Kuti at a children's show and it's a cold open of the cold of the show. So it's a puppet and Fela Kuti, something you're writing on spec. No, no, it's just my thing. It's just part of my sort of on ongoing sort of realm of shorts that are ideas I want to see executed that nobody ever do.
3859200	3889200	Do you write every day? Do you get up at like a certain and get right to it or? Uh, it's every day is different for me. So like, uh, but at some point every day I sit down and, uh, write in some form. I mean, yeah, absolutely. Me too. Every day, every day. I mean, like Stephen King. I, that's what they call me. You know, that motherfucker writes every day. I read on writing. That's why I know somebody told me something. I think it was, I think it was my partner and my other
3889200	3919200	podcast. Uh, uh, uh, Jessica Gao, she quoted something from that book that I thought was really profound and then I immediately forgot. But it sounds like that's, that's the first time I've heard somebody like, uh, like, yeah, Stephen King's on writing sounds like a great inspirational. You know, he almost died. I didn't know that. Yeah. It's crazy. I, uh, I, I had a girlfriend in Milwaukee who, uh, bragged to me that she went out to his place
3919200	3949200	one time and stole one of his gargoyles. And I, to this day, like when I see him on Twitter, I feel like, should I tell him? Cause it's like the world changed that I was like back in Milwaukee in the nineties. It was like, ha ha. Stephen King was a guy, his name's on a book on your bookshelf. And he stole his gargoyle and it's like the world just like tesseracted. And now he's just there. If I mentioned him, he might go, I like record morning. I'm like, my girlfriend's still your gargoyle. You should tell him. You gotta tell him. I don't know. It's, it's
3949200	3979200	not my piece to make though. It is. I didn't do anything. What if you're telling him right now, ladies and gentlemen, I love Rick and Morty. Um, do you read a lot of, uh, fiction? Do you, uh, I do. I've, I have gone back to reading a lot of fiction because I find that writing is much easier for me when I'm reading something. Like I, um, even like a couple months ago, I was just having a hard time like getting words down and I realized I hadn't read a book and like,
3979200	4009200	a month or something like that. So I have, and I'm not working technically. So I got a lot of time. Um, I used to read mostly nonfiction though, but I'm back to fiction. So I don't read anything. Yeah. I can't even read. I feel like I can't, it's like, it's that Twitter thing. I can't read anything longer than a bumper sticker anymore. Like my brain. Oh my God. Oh, that's bumpy burger. Executives are starting to happen. We'll find out what's going on.
4009200	4039200	What happened? We're going to conduct the thorough internal review. Did anybody see what happened? I think it was. Yeah. Hmm. Fucking gel clips. Well, the heavier things are mounted very securely. Okay. Um, how are you emotionally and spiritually and, uh, I'm good. I'm good. Um, exhausted. I put a lot of pressure on myself this year to kind of like crack something open and make something happen in this town.
4039200	4069200	But I, uh, can I help in any way? I suppose. I mean, it's your choice. Like, yeah, I don't, I don't know the answer either. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I just, I mean, all you can do is be who you are and do what you're doing. And, and, but, but I mean, but I'm not, what else are you supposed to do? Yeah. That's, that was either the Royal you like, like everybody can either condense it or that was that you do you Harmon, uh, money. That would help me. I don't have it.
4069200	4099200	I don't know if you saw the headlines, but Rick and mortise and limbo. Um, I, I, I didn't see the headlines. What did they say in limbo? It's not in limbo. It's the, where's the negotiating a contract. And I, so I said, you're still negotiating. I said to the 5,000th kid that tweeted me, Hey, you fat lazy alcoholic stop, um, being so slow writing the scripts. Like, cause they're 15 and they, I understand that they don't know how TV works. I just don't understand why they're so horrible.
4099200	4129200	Why are they so mean? Why are they so there's not, you can't, when, when community fans would go, I'm upset right now because Annie kissed Jeff instead of Britta. I would go first of all, you're, you're crazy because you're upset with me and their fictional characters. But second of all, that's how I feel about TV too. Thank you for the biggest compliment in the world, which is total immersion in my narrative. And I get it. I understand. Uh, the, the compliment on this. I get it.
4129200	4159200	I get it. I get it. I got a, I ate a cupcake today and they're like, why don't you fucking stop eating cupcakes and write the fucking show you piece of shit. And I was like, well, we skipped the part where you like it even like it's crazy. Clearly you do. Is there a world where that would work? Like a kid would go, will you stop eating cupcakes and you'd write the script?
4159200	4189200	And you read the show, even though it hasn't been ordered by the network, which is why now the trades, because now I've yelled at a 15 year old, like it hasn't been ordered. And then so that would be, it's like, I just, I can see on this, on the, on the absolute vodka sponsored sidebars of like the websites where I'm trying to like, uh, procrastinate. It's like, I just, I see like my name and I see Rick and Morty thumbnails. I'm like, ah, you did it again. Um, and, uh, but, but like, uh, yeah, is there a universe where a
4189200	4219200	kid saying that would make me write a season of Rick and Morty by myself, uh, without getting together with Justin? It was Justin. Hey, Justin, I'm going to, I'm just, you know what? This is taking so long. I'm going to just start writing the show. Cause you're going to have to write it anyway. Right. Exactly. And if we have to change it, we'll still have a headstart fade in. Rick's like, ah, I love inventing stuff. And I was like, like, like, like, yeah, no, I don't, I don't see if there was a world where that was going to happen. I think maybe the kid would be saying something
4219200	4249200	along the lines of I have Lou Gehrig's disease and I'd love to see a script of Rick and Morty before I die. And obviously that's not good. I'm not going to get to see the show. Maybe not. Hey, you piece of shit. Um, you're fat. This is why your wife left you. Like, like they dig into my personal life. Yeah. And, and I'm like, you don't know how TV works and you don't know what this is. You're 15. So you're supposed to be dumb, but you're not supposed
4249200	4279200	to have this hubris. This is dangerous. I guess this is what all old people have said about young people forever. Internet people are scary though. We used to get crazy emails of Jezebel. Like every day it was like, well Jezebel terrifies me. Yeah. I mean, like, I can't imagine the people are very bold. That's cause you know, you got to like offer to meet them Spencer's way of putting it, which I thought was very accurate because it kind of like, it's like the internet has stripped shame from the species. And that has resulted in
4279200	4309200	amazing things like, uh, and, and evil things like it has, you, you can now focus in comfort groups for like people with leprosy and stuff like very serious things. Like, uh, you know, that people have had to live in isolation from and, and had terrible stigma. How could you successfully have raised transgender consciousness without the internet? When the very thing about it that, that is used to oppress is that, is that there's not strengthened numbers. There's not like, you know, you're not going to have
4309200	4339200	a million transgender March. Probably people that yell at me for that. But, but, but I just, I mean that in a, in a, in a way of saying like, like we shouldn't have to wait for that. And like, like it's like, it's, that's how amazing the internet is, is that we can go, oh, there's, there's, it doesn't matter. It doesn't, it doesn't have to be mob rule or anything, but it's like, and then the fucking exact same thing happened with Nazis. They're just like, oh yeah. Yeah. No shame. Like, like, no, no. Yeah. Like totally. Like I, no shame. There's also like an, like an invitation to,
4339200	4369200	this method, like your, your, every thought is an opinion and every opinion matters and should be because there's always a cursor. It's just, it became free. It went from being this expensive technology that Gutenberg developed on the set of cocoon and my references are getting so older than the first Gutenberg. Like, like, like, yeah, it was, it was like lasers to have to print a newspaper or leave a comment on something. And then it
4369200	4399200	became like anything to say in this Farmville move. Yeah. Well, there you go. It's now it's in Farmville font. Remember back in the comic book days where people would snail mail the shit that you get comments on. Yeah. Like we would get in Milwaukee. Somebody went, hmm. I'm going to write this shitty comment down. I suppose you're wondering why I would take pen to paper and there's such circumstances. However, it permits me to make a bit of an introduction. First of all, if you were
4399200	4429200	to ask questions about myself, I am a, what they call a militant virgin. I am proud to see your comic book has given me very much guidance through this. However, I object to the principles at hand. Now, second of all, in regards to issue three, yeah. And then it would just, it would have a, you'd have to put a stamp on it. Walk to the mailbox. That person had to, had to need to put cardio into their fucking parasitism. There's an entitlement thing too, because I find that if like, if I tweet something and then someone responds back with some
4429200	4459200	new, a fucking question and they're like, why'd you tweet it? I'm like, just because I tweet something is not an invitation for your dumbass opinions. And they think that just putting anything out there is like, now I get to respond to it. And it's you like, I have the right to, and you have to respond to me. And if you didn't want people to like comment you about it, you shouldn't have said it. And it's like, nobody's talking to you. It's not a conversation. I'm not having a conversation with any of you people. Yeah.
4459200	4489200	I mean, like every once in a while, and this is a fun way to use Twitter every once in a while, I'll go like, Hey, I need shorts. You know, like, like anybody got any, or I found a drone in my yard. Does anyone know who's it is? And like the internet snaps out. It's like, yeah, there's very specific points. When as a primate, you could recognize when someone wants information from you and it, if, and if we keep defining it as when a cursor is blinking underneath what they're saying, we're going to die.
4489200	4519200	It's like, oh, we can obviously do a million things, but the internet's and websites, they present a number of options and so they limit it. And so you're not thinking, oh, commenting is not something I have to worry about. But then it gives you an option. It's like, would you like to comment? This is something you should consider doing. And it's like, well, no, you shouldn't consider commenting every time you see a box that says comment that would be absurd. Well, I don't know if they ever like, but they don't have a box that says comment.
4519200	4545500	Like I noticed that the people they're writing for online publications and stuff, they, they started having to put in their like TV reviews and stuff. Like, like they, they, they have to end their paragraph with like, did you think a little inflammatory? No, don't, don't tell them they need to be ashamed.
4545800	4565840	Yeah, I did not, I did not like the comments. I know I, I like the, just any benefit. I mean, it was nice when people like stuff and sometimes people gave you corrections and sometimes it was helpful, but like it, the negative far outweighed any of the positive. And like, it was always this thing of like professionalism.
4565840	4594420	Like if we, if they would like, people would comment stuff on, on articles and they'd be just smart asses. And then we would respond back like smart asses. Cause you're, you came in being a dick and like, I can be a dick too. And then they're like, well, this is really unprofessional and it's like, you just call it like, you just called me stupid. Also, I don't work for or with you. And this is not a service. So there's no professionalism to be had between you and I, because we're like, I, it's me and my coworkers and I'm not providing a service to you.
4594520	4605760	We're just putting the shit out there and you're choosing to read it. And like, I just, if we could have, every day I would ask our editor, like it became a joke where I was like, can we, can we get rid of the comments today?
4607200	4622240	If we get rid of the comment section, then we're competing with websites that have comment sections. And there's a certain, I don't know who the fuck these people are, but there's, there's a sizable percentage of the audience that like, they like to comment.
4622580	4648260	So if Jezebel removes their comment section and Hezebel doesn't, Hezebel, I guess gets that 10%, 20% of readers and it's over terrified. But then, and I just, man, I mean, this is how, like journalism, seeing the internet and going, what do we do is, is, is, is the whole reason why we're in everything now.
4648260	4662400	Because instead of going, we need to double down on journalistic standards and like basically elitism. Because I'm sure we sound like elitists right now to somebody who's like, I leave a lot of comments. What makes you so better?
4662400	4676220	Aren't you doesn't, isn't Kara's job to comment on society? And then I leave a comment under her comment on culture and like, now I'm an asshole because I'm just a plebe. Well, I guess part of me wants to just go, yeah, let's end that argument.
4676220	4688680	You are a plebe. Like you're, you're, you're, you're fucking thought process is horrible. Like you didn't, you didn't want to spend any more than the three hours it took you to write these two paragraphs about like how she's technically being unfair.
4688680	4700280	It's like, you're, you're not, you don't, you don't really hurt as much for this as, as, as, as the person you're commenting on does. So yeah, elitism, I guess, but like,
4700280	4715140	they're doing work. You commenting isn't like, it, it wasn't, it's not like it just came to mind. It's like, I wrote something, I spent time on it. Someone else read it. It was checked. Like I was doing, I was doing something and that's.
4715140	4730260	But even, but you and I agree that even on Twitter where we're not doing work, if I'm just like, Hey, I don't like, I don't like banana splits. Here's the, here's the, here's the replies. I enjoy a smart, fun person saying,
4730280	4749540	like banana splits are the, are the blank of blank. Like, like, maybe it's a swing and a miss, but it's like, they tried and it's like, they're, they're yes, ending. They're going there. You know, they're not, here's the ones I don't like, they're, they're technically not banana splits. That's a fallacy or whatever the fall.
4749540	4778640	The banana split at the other place or, or like, or like just repeating the joke. Like, like, I can't give an example of that because bananas, I don't like banana splits isn't a joke, but, but, but like, where they just like repeat it. And it's like, it makes you wonder if like they knew like, so what do you think I am? Do you think I'm just a guy just like making noise? And now you're making a joke. I just, I, and I put a flow chart. I pinned it to my Twitter profile. I, I, I, I, I, I, I grafted out where you can walk through it.
4778740	4807740	If you read a tweet, you can walk through the flow chart when deciding whether or not you should reply. And it's, it's pretty, it's pretty well thought out. If I give, if I do say so myself, how long did it take you to make the flow chart? I'm not going to comment on that until I turn this script in the, but it's like, and then I posted it. I was like, there we go. So, you know, that's good. Then, then like, I, I don't have to get mad at people anymore because I can even, if anything, I can just reprint the flow chart. Everybody looked at the flow chart. And because I, they like.
4808440	4823640	80% of the people were like, ha ha. Oh, how do you know when you finish? Or like, they were like, they thought it was a board game or they thought it was like a flow chart of whether or not I will respond to their tweet.
4823840	4842340	This is, this is so there used to be, in my opinion, there used to be a gear of hesitation in that. So shame, see something. Yeah. But there's this fear of being expelled from the fig tree of monkeys, because you suck fear of that.
4842340	4869340	The reflex and the opinion are not the same thing. So you have a reflex of action or response to something. And your first was your, there used to be a check that sort of said, all right, let me just be ashamed for just a second away. Let this, let this opinion form. Let me think about what, and then if it, if it became something that you had solidified, you could, you would post that if it was, if there was enough base to overcome the shame acid, you had a milkshake. Yeah.
4869340	4896040	That sort of gag reflex is gone. And now people just kind of go like that right away. Yeah, here's something that I is in my head. And it's like, and you can never again, you can't say to the person like, well, you don't even know how to spell and you're like, yelling at me. That's long gone. We're in the middle of an anti intellectual revolution. The president is like, I, he spells cats, dogs.
4896440	4924340	People don't read anything also is something I've learned because I would get comments and it's like they're commenting on something. I'm like, it is literally in the thing I just wrote. You made it halfway through and you got pissy and you went in and left a comment. And if you would just finished reading the fucking article, the exact thing question that you have was answered. And I mean, even with Twitter, I feel like people like, I'll get responses. I'm like, are you understanding what I just said? I don't think you're understanding this or you're not reading this clearly.
4924340	4954340	People and that irony is that underneath it all, people just want to be heard and connect, but they can't then turn that into empathy and go, Oh, I guess that's how everyone feels. So maybe don't like go into this YouTube video of someone's daughter doing ballet and go, she looks a little fat. Like, like, like, like, because the reason you're saying that is that that's your pirouette. Like, that's you wanting praise on a YouTube video from your dad that doesn't exist. And it's like, it's insane that you can't anyways, let's do this to save
4954340	4984260	save, save, save you guys from my maelstrom. What's what's good about the modern world? What's what do we like about it? It used to be worse in some ways. Yeah, you see those those beer bottles that the mountain turns blue if it's cold. Holy shit. That's the perfect temperature to drink beer. What is really my therapist always makes me do this. Like, what's good? What's what is good? Even if it's just in your personal life? Like, oh, well, you're you're easy.
4984340	5014340	You're you're on a fucking streak. That's what's good. You don't even give a shit about us. You just think you're like, I wonder if I get a parking space next season. No, I mean, it's I think I have to remember that, at least for a black person, it's better to be alive anytime in the future than in the past. Right. Most likely. So it's better now than to
5014340	5035860	20 years ago. So I guess there's that. Yeah, like it. It's Yeah. Yeah. It's hard not to be positive about it, because you can't be nostalgic about it. No, still not great. Yeah. No, but I it's like, I would rather be alive now than 60 years ago. But I think
5036620	5064580	along those lines, one of the things is that the representations of what we see are more specific now because you can't hide behind this idea that people only want to see this type of family on TV or that kind of thing. So you're talking about the Huxtables. And that was for me, that was like, one of the first times that I saw situations that were reflective of my own life. And people would come up and say, well, it's not it's not a real family, or it's not a this or it's not a that.
5065580	5083700	I know plenty of families through my parents and through my, you know, other just circles were black lawyer, black doctor, black, whatever, black, black wheels, or black, whatever, who had friends and have the best parts for me, the costumes would be at the end, when the guest star would have been a
5083700	5113700	musician of amazing note, but that I didn't know I didn't know who Betty Carter was until that episode where she came in, they give her 10 minutes at the end of the show to sing a song as part of the narrative, that kind of stuff. And so for me as a kid, I go, I don't know who that is. But that song is amazing. Wait for the credits to roll, write the name down, go to the library right after that, realize who this woman is, and and how amazing she was. And that show just had constantly had that kind of stuff. And then the
5113700	5143700	show just had that kind of stuff. And so I think that now what's happening is so much stuff is happening so much faster. And you have kids whose vision of the world is is several increments faster than the people who are trying to create entertainment for them, because now people are trying to match up with these kids in the way that they see the world. And the internet is one way that you see that. I mean, you have to kind of, yeah, if we can last another
5143700	5173700	30 years, we have we are living through a tipping point where the syndrome that we've been grappling with will will have been overcome. Right? Like, we can all agree on that. But now it's a question, ironically, if we if we are here in 30 years, if we could have what we have today, plus, now, now that we got, now that we got a Shonda, and then therefore are going to have the 10 Shonda imitators and the 500, like Shonda, Inspirees and the and the blah, blah,
5173700	5203700	like, not just confining it to that topic, but keeping it on theme for this episode. But like, like it, that plus 20 years equals boom, I think we're done. And but the it's it is that wide. So it's like, we're having a fever, because we're like, we're like, it's getting too close to that. It's like, like, I don't I don't like all this talk about like, I don't I keep hearing that I'm white. And I just don't like it. And it's like making me uncomfortable. Like, I've never heard that before. It's like, wait, do you mean I'm bad? I don't know what that
5203700	5233700	means. Like, I haven't been called white outside of like a Richard Pryor album in like, and like, so like, we're in America is just like, it's having this seismic fucking conniption fit precisely because things because we're in the bubble right now, because things are almost there. We're in a place now where you can't, it's a lot harder to walk around and go like, I don't know what that is. Or I don't know what that term is. Everything is changing so fast. And they just throw in these words. You now have to learn the vocabulary. People are learning that there is a
5233700	5259940	place for themselves in this world. And they're choosing their own definitions. And then they're forcing you to learn the label because what I'm excited about, which I don't think other white people understand about as far as changing times under our feet, is that if you if it feels like a conveyor belt is making you go like this, like, yeah, your first instinct is something's going wrong, stop it from happening. But much like with mp3 technology or anything else that is just going to happen.
5259940	5289340	The second thing that happens is you now have an unprecedented license to be even more relaxed than you've ever been like you can now like pretty soon if this nightmare that you're worried about where white people are somehow just other people like like like or and that they're always wrong or there was it's like you can now be you could just go like, yeah, I don't know, like, like, which is like a fun I like, like, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. Is that what you call that?
5289940	5317940	It's a form of of social custom. I certainly wasn't trying to offend anybody. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I'm just white, right? I'm a fucking idiot. Like, isn't that a luxury? Isn't that fun? Like, that's like being in a cruise ship. Excuse me. Where's the bathroom? I just took a shit over the rail. I don't know. You tell me. I'm just here. I'm just old and dying on a boat. I don't know. I don't know why I'm like looking at you guys like right, right? It's like I have the wrong panel for this. It just says like business as usual to me.
5319940	5349940	I think you know what I do think though. I think I think white people just also maybe need to relax a little bit. Like, it'll be fine. We get to now. It'll be fine. It's like not invited to the conversation. You don't have to care about Black Panther. Isn't that isn't that fun? Yeah, it's fine. You don't have to. You can't you can't you can't make or break a Marvel movie with your Rotten Tomatoes review. Isn't isn't that nice? You can take the day off. You don't have to care. I guess I'm flaunting my my my
5349940	5379940	friend and I have the advantage of listening to Jessica Gao for for however many episodes we've been doing that show. Yeah. I just like that. That had to really be drilled into me cuz I was like we're talking about theuilding and I was like I've still like. What
5379940	5409940	you're Optimus Prime and you're in charge but we hate you for being in charge and we we want we want you to stop doing things but we want you to start doing things different all this stuff and she's like no one said you were Optimus Prime. It turned into this like really weird like moment where I was like wait so I don't have to have an opinion about Confederate. Yeah. And she's like no. No. No one asked for your opinion about it. I'm like but and I'm thinking in my head but but yeah I'm like good. I don't wanna have one.
5409940	5439940	It sounds like a really sticky situation. I'd rather just like look at my Twinkie and eat it like like like what a fucking amazing I just gained five hours of my work week. I don't I don't have to sound off about fucking Confederate and whether it like and I can't you apply that to everything America can't you like can't you stop fucking commenting on everything that you're not you don't need your feedback is not going to make a difference. It's not going to get you
5439940	5469940	a job. It's not going to keep anything bad from happening. You are dumb and you're going to stay dumb and if you're poor you should you should do something that makes money and commenting isn't one of them and if you're rich then you're going to you're losing money commenting and you're if I mentioned you're stupid and and no one cares and check out the flow chart. Yeah. Yeah. Just go look at my flow chart. Look at the flow chart.
5469940	5499940	I don't get caught in a loop. Did we did we fill our didn't you promise him two minutes of bumpies. Oh yeah. Well yes he yes he did promise that I gave it to him like my iPad and he didn't. How are the fries at bumpies. I like French fries. No but were they. What kind of fries were they. They were French like the thin ones. They were thin. They were thin. Wait. You know it's been a long time. Okay. So.
5499940	5529940	I bet you they were thin fries. But I like the French fries. I love French fries. Do you like bumpy burger more than McDonald's. Yeah. Because I drew a logo for it and I won a competition. How come they didn't put it on a billboard outside of town. They didn't put it on a billboard but they put it on their menu. Oh that's pretty cool. That is cool. Yeah. That was worth it wasn't it. Yeah.
5529940	5559940	We still got a minute left. Did we really talk for two hours. No I just mean to have covered two minutes of bumpy burgers. Oh I mean no one said the podcast has to be two hours also. What time. No no one ever has ever said that. And most people are like stop making the podcast two hours. Really. You read that stuff. Yeah. I'm at work. I'm already at work and I want to press. I got to press pause. Yeah. Yeah. And that's when we play Dungeons and Dragons. And so we're not going to play it this week. And people are always like that's the worst part of
5559940	5589940	the show. Spencer hates himself. I don't know why he keeps showing up. It seems like he wants to kill himself. It seems like every time I see Spencer he's going to kill himself. I don't know why Spencer hates himself so much in everything he does. So maybe that also happens because the show goes on so long. Must be nice to be able to read about yourself on the Internet without killing yourself. Oh it's great. I'm I I've. Yeah it's great. I definitely want a lot of typing Dan Harmon into Google and seeing what the autofill
5589940	5619940	says. I know you have. No I haven't. I know. I mean the last time I did was like eight years ago and it was definitely like Dan. It was like Chevy Chase Dan Harmon Chevy Chase all this stuff. Chevy's pissed at me. Oh no. He's pissed at a lot of people. Yeah but he was we were friends and I consider that an accomplishment because I was an asshole to him by doing that voicemail thing and I felt like I was mature and then that article came out with that was about the feature on Donald.
5619940	5649940	I like I had a quote in there that and I was like it was like right on the heels of me like a really nice conversation with Chevy and he was like he wasn't he hasn't talked to me since. What what. Well I don't say what did you do now. What did you do. What did you do now. He said well the article said that like Chevy recognized Donald's talent and stuff like that. And I never and it said I mean honestly like all due respect to the writer who wrote a really incredible piece on Donald. So I know he must be a good guy but like I did have
5649940	5679940	two conversations with him on the phone where I was like very adamant about how I did not want to dog pal Chevy and was really worried about this quote and he it really was kind of assembled out of like weird like I I would never ever use the word jealous in reference to an actor because I know that that would. It's it's it's it's I just know that that's like the J word like you don't say yeah so and so was jealous of so and so like especially about actors and I and I just like.
5679940	5709940	It's just like whatever. Just thought I had my second I'm a bad interviewer drink and now I'm now I'm in therapy just mean I'm not going to get my script done. Then I get to be miserable for another week. Thanks Levi. Yeah Steve's traditionally right in these scenarios. Are you in love Kara Kara not with me. The Netflix series. No no relationship. Is that is that bad form.
5709940	5739940	What's going on with you sexually now. Well you said it normal. Yeah. And then I and then you made it weird. What's going on with you sexually. Well I got as close as I could I said emotionally for tomorrow's is like what's going on tomorrow's. No I don't know if you have always weird. It's weird. That's where you're going to meet like the coolest person in the world. Yeah. Yeah. I would rather I would rather have a good script than a
5739940	5769940	boyfriend right now. I think that's what I'm saying. One could do a lot for me. I heard one light clapping from the back of the warehouse. I think your publicist is here. Someone. Yes. Work all. Yeah. Well that's your you're probably 19. I'm not going to ask you. Don't don't rush it. Are you going to ask. No no.
5769940	5799940	If you want to know how old Kara Brown is go research her and in the process read some of her amazing little thought pieces on on her website which is really easy to remember K. A. R. A. Brown dot com. But she doesn't even need you to go there anymore because she's departed from that world. She doesn't she thinks that the Internet is a bunch of shit heads like I do.
5799940	5829100	Borrow. You're going to be borrowing iPads anywhere in the neighborhood. I hate you. Are you enjoying the iPad. Can you at least give us an update. I haven't. I haven't used it since I brought it. Are you fucking kidding me. What. No. You haven't used it. I kind of used it and then I don't know. I I don't know how many times we have to discuss this. This is insane.
5830720	5853960	Why is it insane. I gave I let him borrow an iPad pro because he wanted to see how it worked. And then he came in the podcast and told the story about how me doing that made him feel bad. And then I felt bad about using it. Oh. And so you're just keeping it on a shelf to make things better. No.
5854580	5880220	Do you have to give it back. Does he have to go back. He needs it so badly because he he needs two of them. He needs it so badly. He's it's so badly. Did you take it to even the score. Are you Robin Hood. No. No. I it's I look at all things creative right now. And it's just like a wait. It's I'm you know we've talked about this. Yeah.
5880220	5910220	I was hoping that it would inspire me. It didn't. So we'll give it back. I think that's you last week. I'd give it back. That's how most iPad purchases feel. I think they get up. They got the pencil. That's true. A hundred dollar pencil. Well it's worth it because finally the reason I wanted it. You know but I just I don't have anything that makes me want to draw right now. I mean unless you have something like that you should redraw those drawings that you're posting from when you're
5910220	5940220	a kid. Remember those are really cool. You know those are better than anything anyone's ever drawn. Thanks. Yeah. I think I'm of the opinion that you should just take it easy and let yourself. I have been. I have been. I'm I'm sorry. Do you deal with. You're too young. You've never done. I'm not going to ask but you've never dealt with like. Oh God. Rob
5940220	5970220	you're you're you're you're you have you have germination phases where you're like I'm done. I'm I don't have ideas or something. Yeah. I can't work. I'm I'm desiccated. I'm I will say one of the things the Internet. A good thing about the Internet was that we were writing. I was writing every. Yeah. Born into a deadline. Yeah. One of the deadline in your hand. Yeah. So I do like it. I think of it very much as like oh this is my job. My job is writing. And so I have to do my job.
5970220	6000220	So yeah use use. All right. Well I should have anything to plug. Don't high road me. I wasn't to mortgage. I know you have anything to plug a live show at the Lyric Hyperion with Anna Sergina and with Thomas and they've sort of come up with these personas who are poets and they're going to do it straight as almost as like a straight poetry reading or something. And then they came to me and said we want you to be the person
6000220	6030220	who curates the event. We're not going to tell you what to do. You just do whatever. So I'm this character that I've sort of been creating over the last couple of months named Ephraim Elizabeth King is sort of like a composite of any writing and structure I had in college. It's we've never had you do a character on this show. Like your character work is amazing. Oh thanks man. I mean I did. You know what's the space in Shadow. Bernie Sanders. Oh yeah. I mean you. Yeah. Like yeah. It's like you immerse yourself into the silliest shit and then make the so it's like it's like
6030220	6060220	that's the best part about it. Yeah. Sort of finding connections to things and then connecting the gaps and just sort of disappearing and just you know coming out the other end. It's like the Fela Kuti thing is just because I was hanging out with Kyle and he said I want to open the next episode of Gumble with this song. And it was just Fela talking and the music of his voice. I was like that's pretty close to mine. I bet you I could do that. And then he counts off the song and he just goes one two three five.
6060220	6090220	And I was like that's that's a five second impression. That's perfect. If you just did that and walked away. So the whole premise of that thing is like what how little can I do. But then also physically I'm going to cut a crazy widow's peak in my hair. And for one day just have this weird Fela Kuti haircut. You know just to set up a joke that's kind of like that. But we can't order it up like a fry cook. We can't go.
6090220	6120220	Or we'll introduce you as an alternate thing. Like you'll just come up as some like character and do something and walk off. Yeah. Just don't introduce me as the mortgage. Introduce me as the character. Hell yeah. Are you going to do it. So you're going to go in the kitchen and cook something up and let us know when you want to do that. And then I'll just. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that. Let's do that. OK. Great. Wow. This has been a productive evening. I mean I do that all the time. This is what I do with characters. Like with 101 even what I'll do is like if the characters ready in a way then I'll just kind of in a week.
6120220	6150220	The best thing is to go to food courts and malls as a character and just kind of hang out and just do mundane shit like order food and kind of be not so much to see how people react but see how it feels to be reacted to by real people. Because then suddenly you've got this inner thing that's that's building and it's you think less about what's on the outside. More about the insides. All right. Dan do you have anything to plug. Yeah. Watch for my butt. Hell yeah.
6150220	6180220	I have to plug my butt. I have to plug my fat ass. I'm sorry. Yeah. No you had. You have some of the. You know why he's sorry is because he he he lost just strategic ground. It's not because he actually has remorse or empathy. Right. He's making. He was like oh shit. I'm the bad guy now. I better back pedal. That's a good thing. Yeah. Yes. He's like oh I oh did Napoleon. Did you did you move into Russia.
6180220	6210220	I sure did. Give me my iPad back. Yes. Give it back. Come over and get it. Come over and get it. Come to my house. I had people over yesterday. I'm writing. It's hard to write. You're telling me. You're telling me. As soon as I'm finished I will be a good person. I'm going to end this 45 years of being a piece of shit with retirement
6210220	6240220	and I'm going to know everyone's zodiac sign. I'm going to like ask about your kids. It's got you. Everyone's going to love me. They're going to be like you were this cool the whole time. Yeah. I was busy. That's it. So watch for that coming up soon. Yeah. Now that Rick and Morty's in limbo it's like faster upon us. All right. Well does anyone have a question for me. Spencer is there anything you'd like to plug. Oh I don't know. I don't know. That's a great
6240220	6270220	man. It's so interesting you ask. I guess I got to think about that. You guys hear about these these Chinese murder bands. They're bands in China. Isn't that just racist slang for ambulance. No we we do do this every time. It's great. It's my favorite. This is becoming like a real running gag. No. But they're these these vans that they'll they'll pick you up and they'll kill you. And in theory they're in some cases they've
6270220	6300220	they've linked to selling and transmitting your organs. So watch out for that. Yeah. Also watch out for if you have a student protest in a giant square in the center of your town. Like they just turn off the cameras and roll all of you over with steam rollers. And there's that's another thing to keep your eye out for. Right. Tenements. Did that really happen. Yeah. They fucking those people are spaghetti. Those people are spaghetti by the by by numbers that
6300220	6330220	would shock by numbers. Yeah. Tiananmen Square happened and notice the yeah it's like they were like oh look at the guy from the tank. I can't tell if you're being serious. And then they and then and then they just they just fucking soylent green people into fucking like. Yeah. They killed everybody. They killed everybody. Everyone. This is what happens in autocracies. This is why we shouldn't think it's cool to fucking like Russia. They kill gay people and journalists. Like
6330220	6360220	they they they like like China is a fucking. Yeah. Like you can't like can I just quickly on a soapbox. People people who are like oh man you shouldn't be worried about Russia. It's like read about Russia. It's really bad. They definitely are putting gay people into camps. It's not about virtue signaling. It's about pragmatism. If you're into game theory and you're fucking like you should be scared of the idea of not having checks and balances and three branches of government. You fucking idiot. Yeah. Sorry. You think I'm a noble.
6360220	6390220	I just don't want to die. Part of it is like the way news is reported in this country. So for example when I can't think of the guy's name when the first Hitler not the first but when the spy was poisoned radioactively poisoned Skirpal. It showed up on ABC News the day that it was sort of prominent as president. This is happening. He's dying. This is going on. If you read The Economist which is not the great
6390220	6420220	greatest magazine in the world but like it is certainly informative and has an opinion about a lot of stuff and it's weekly and they he was saying for a year and a half before that they're going to get me. They're going to get me and people were listening but nobody was doing anything. And when they went in a Chernobyl and like or when it went in and but these girls and like gas that that basement and then said well there were people in there. They were going to do bad things. So we had to take them all out. There was a journalist who called bullshit on that and then she
6420220	6450220	got shot in the head. I don't get a public courtyard. That's the thing. This is within five years. The whole time 20 shit like 20 things like that have happened. Like this is not or not just making it like this shit has happened. People are being killed. Yeah. We had a period in American history in the 1920s when like the gangland culture was like being celebrated by journalists and and you know it was prohibition all that stuff. The thing that really brought that whole thing down wasn't necessarily prohibitions repeal and it wasn't
6450220	6480220	al Capone's taxes being police. They killed a journalist like like like somebody wrote something about one of the gangsters that the gangsters didn't like and they just they just treated him the way they treat mobsters and the funds stopped. Like we in our most brutal times like we have always in this country maybe only for white people.
6480220	6510220	We have to be careful. We are animals. We will murder each other. People will get away with what they get away with. Like you don't want to live in this world you think you want to live in where tough guys are able to do whatever they want and everything seems cool. You're dumb. You're dumb and you're 15 and you're stupid and I hate you. Read the flow chart. This is something that I figured out with no research. I am as dumb as you are. I'm a 15 year old that lived for 30 more
6510220	6540220	years if that math is right. That's how stupid I am. I along the way. Here's what you pick up. You're going to die if the government stops being a democracy. You fucking moron. Knock it off. It's not fun. It's not going to be fun. Journalists getting killed is not. It's it's it is a it's like that's like your country has has HIV at that point. Like there is you can't you're you're all right. Anyways quip toothbrushes are
6540220	6570220	an amazing new technology. The buzz when you brush your teeth. Harmontown is brought to you by him's for men for him's for him's him's for him's for him's dot com. If you're bald or your or just your balls are. I don't think you're describing impotence right. It's not when your balls go bald. Not the way I get it. It's a one stop shop for all the things that plague men. You're you're you're you're you're going bald. You want to avoid it. You're I guess you're
6570220	6600220	your weiner has. Why would you want to avoid it when it makes you so handsome. Well the listeners are going to have to answer that question for themselves when they go to for him's dot com and take advantage of our sponsorship. Take the survey. It's free and ask yourself this. How much money is the sponsor model making compared to the subscription model. And why are we doing this. When it gets to the point where you're shilling boner pills. I don't. I want to show boner pills and it's a real problem.
6600220	6630220	It could be it's it's it's it may be a battle we can afford to lose. All right. Well care. Did you have a good time. I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to fish but it was a good podcast. Right. You love being here. Yeah. You come back sometime. Yeah. This this 8 p.m. on on a Sunday in perfect. Oh yeah. No it's good. What else would I have done. All right. Well I'm bad at ending shows. I'm bad at starting of a better running them. Everyone misses Jeff. Everyone misses Kumail. Go fuck yourself. It's a terrible show.
6630220	6660220	Here's your five dollars back. Eat my dick. Fuck you. I'll be in a better mood next week because I will be done with all of my work. All right. And I'm never going to work again. I'm not going to work on anything. That's not easy. I'm going to be like Baryshnikov but without the training. I'm just going to be a dude that's like spinning around going there's your draft. I look like you just falling. That's what I do.
6660220	6690200	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I pitched rapping close the show. Yeah. Time to go out. The laptops go. Close your shit. Buckle it. Put your shoes on. Send your mom a picture of your tits. Say these are smaller than yours. And she'll say that's because of heteronormative norms. And you'll say my titties are as big as they want to be.
6690680	6707400	She'll say but they can't compete with this. Come on. See. And then you've got to lunch. All right. Good night. See you next week. Oh yeah. That's our show everybody. Thanks so much for coming out.
6707400	6736380	Thanks to Chris Bohroff. Sarah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Do that. Kevin. Zach the Audio Maniac. Everyone that we're forgetting. Nolan. Steve Levy. Oh boy. Thanks to our guest carer Brown. Our guest comptroller Rob Shrob. Demours Brown of course. And last but not least our mayor Dan Harmon. Thanks so much. Stay home and don't take chances.
6737400	6759380	Did you get any of that? It's a good show.
