0	5400	Hello gang from beautiful uptown Burbank because the fire marshal shut us
5400	11160	motherfucking down last Saturday. Harmontown is now in session from the
11160	17440	confines of the recording studio at Starburns Industries. I'm Jeff Davis
17440	21180	your common children. Give it up for your game master. Don't give it up. There's no
21180	25820	audience here. You have to give nothing. If you're listening you could clap.
25820	30540	You know what yeah from wherever you're listening right now all around the world
30540	35580	just do yourself a favor just for your own sense of peace of mind. Give it way
35580	39460	up for the game master Spencer Critton. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna give you
39460	42900	time to keep clapping. Yeah. I mean you don't have to but we just don't want to
42900	46580	tell them not to in case they're so inclined. I'm gonna keep pausing until the
46580	49740	people that are really clapping have clapped themselves out. All right. And I
49740	53140	want to do it so long that people that think they should have stopped by now
53140	56940	are gonna feel bad when I keep pausing.
58300	64380	All right. Let's give it up for your mayor Dan Harmon.
66540	73860	Thank you. Thank you very much. So yeah we got shut down. We were apparently
73860	80580	performing quite illegally since the from the very moment that we left
80580	86300	Meltdown. I wouldn't have left Meltdown if I had known that. I wouldn't have had
86300	91380	people you know audiences coming into an illegal place. If you're listening and
91380	95180	you've come to the live shows no you can't sue us. Don't be stupid. And the
95180	99380	rumors that there was a sex for pay scandal happening. These are all
99380	105600	unfounded. I should say you know no we were doing every we were illegal in
105600	110080	terms of like you know the fire department you know this is serious
110080	113340	stuff. Like I don't want to be in violation of fire code. We need we
113340	119400	didn't have permits that we we have applied for a long time ago. I think the
119400	123720	misunderstanding was that we thought it would work like driving where you're
123720	127320	when you're 16 you can just have a thing in your glove box that says you're
127320	133400	working on getting your license. And then if a fire marshal ever
133520	140480	wondered in that that we could just flash a piece of paper signed by our
140480	147320	driver's ed teacher and we would be there for it to keep performing. We
147320	151800	really had big dreams for that venue. Remember the guy who said oh here you go
151800	157840	with your podcast the playbook. You got your own venue now. Your podcast is
157840	163360	gonna die. Oh yeah. I mean he's probably because he's a dumbass that guy
163360	166640	is definitely high-fiving himself right now. I mean I wouldn't say this
166640	170240	vindicates him but he would. His threshold for vindication is probably
170240	173920	very low. He probably congratulates himself for masturbating. That guy's
173920	177880	probably dead. You know what I'm not gonna say I hope so but because we've
177880	181840	got a lot of death in the news going on right now and I want every human out
181840	189800	there alive that is is still alive. Now the night we were drinking nearby you
189800	193360	and I and our friends like the church and Cody and our friends Daniel and
193360	197160	Rachel were having a drink and we got the message that the show was canceled
197160	201240	like 40 minutes before the show. Yeah what happened was there was another there
201240	204360	was like a party going on in the same neighborhood. Now originally I what I
204360	208880	heard was that there they were operating illegally so the fire department showed
208880	213320	up to shut them down and then noticed the big crowd outside our castle. That's
213320	217640	not true. What I then heard is that it's a little it's a little less
217640	222520	ironic than that. It's it's actually because they were operating legally the
222520	226920	fire department was there to help them or something because you actually need
226920	230480	fire people on hand if you're gonna perform or something like that. If you're
230480	234560	gonna have a crowd in a space of a certain type I think you need like an
234560	238120	off-duty fireman or something like that and that person was there in that
238120	242560	capacity saw our space looked for his colleague that should have been also
242560	248640	there didn't see him. Where's Panch? Oh that place must be non it must be
248640	254280	flammable and and so then that's how we ended up getting shut down and I'm
254280	256960	really sorry to anybody that showed up that night including our guest Dave
256960	262640	Anthony. And people that had flown in from or driven in from long distances
262640	268360	we feel terrible about that. We didn't get to meet a few people that had flown
268360	272040	in from New York or yeah Pennsylvania or whatever. It's interesting like those
272040	274920	people are always so nice I mean I would of course if they started to
274920	278040	actually express discontent when something like this happened I would
278040	281520	immediately skip to hating them but as it is when they're there because they're
281520	285180	so nice about it I'm just kind of in awe of them because I mean imagine the
285180	288560	disappointment there there's there was like literally some people that that that
288560	293440	you know they're always a little embarrassed to to actually say the words
293440	297120	I came here for this reason you know because who wants to say that especially
297120	300720	if you are a nice person you don't want to guilt somebody out or imply that
300720	306000	you're this is the you know the big thing that you wanted to come out for I
306000	309840	think there's a natural kind of shame there and that's why I'm always really
309840	313400	impressed by those people they're always so nice maybe the ones that aren't nice
313400	317780	and are really outraged they skulk into the shadows and curse my name but yeah
317780	321680	there's a couple of those people came by the the Guild Hall the bar that we've
321680	326040	discovered that's like an eSports nerd themed bar that's a couple miles from
326040	330000	the stage if you're in Burbank go there but these people came and they got to
330000	335800	take pictures and unwrap with us and buy us shots and it they acted like that
335800	341560	made it worth it and I really appreciate yeah I hope so but but now can I can I
341560	345440	tell you like I was gonna go to a show but I couldn't because Harmontown I
345440	349640	wouldn't have gotten there in time our friend the singer Peaches the teachers of
349640	354520	Peaches she's fantastic I've never seen her actually do a full live show she's
354520	359600	playing at the Roxy so Church and I went and we got there right on time and
359600	365400	the show is absolutely fantastic after the show we're up in the green room at
365400	370080	the Roxy and we're having champagne and you know our friends are there Peaches
370080	374920	is you know in her makeup and sweaty and she just did a ridiculously high
374920	381280	energy badass show Ron Jeremy was also in the room now he is usually at the
381280	384280	rainbow bar and grill every time I've been there he's been there like he kind
384280	390080	of lives there and he was inordinately like unreasonably moist like he was very
390080	395480	wet like he was just has he just had a sheen and like kind of a like the high
395480	400160	pro glow he was very oily do you know that this is uncharacteristic around
400160	405800	your I don't I mean I he it's an air-conditioned building and he wasn't
405800	409720	dancing but you've seen him naked so you know that air conditioning or not he
409720	416240	has a built-in furnace but he looked like he had just been fucking he looked
416240	420800	porn sweaty but he was just in a t-shirt hanging out in a green room full of
420800	424080	people that weren't sweaty unless they had just gotten off the stage okay and
424080	431080	I'd seen him there briefly he walked right past me as he was leaving this
431080	434440	very small green room the green room was really like it's half the size of this
434440	441120	booth and he had a banana peel a spent banana peel over his shoulder like an
441120	449040	epaulette and his hair is long Ron Jeremy wet hair is in like kind of
449040	453880	intertwined on this banana peel and I'm sitting on the edge of the couch with a
453880	458400	bottle of champagne and cups because I was kind of being like the de facto
458400	464280	like bartender and I he walked by me like he so he's back is to me he's like
464280	468240	arms length for me walking towards the door and I said sir you have a banana
468240	474880	peel on your shoulder and he wheeled around turn me goes yeah thanks and then
474880	479520	fucking blown up like he was bummed out about it like wait okay all right and
479520	487000	now the theories begin so I mean he did he for did he previously 20 minutes
487000	491440	before then did he have 30 banana peels on him did someone dump a barrel of
491440	495760	banana peels on him and he thought he cleaned them all off and was leaving my
495760	499480	first my first theory and also like people say Pixar didn't happen this
499480	505640	happened so quickly Pixar didn't happen no I bet it's are several Oscars
505640	510400	including one stolen from my studio big to different all right go ahead no picks
510400	514120	or it didn't happen why didn't why did not I take a picture of this because it
514120	517320	happened in the blink of an eye right of course you're not my first theory was
517320	522640	that he was doing a bit that you're you're supposed to be a woman to ask him
522640	525800	about that and then he makes a dick reference or something that's my first
525800	532520	theory oh because that's so grody Lee positive plausible but the only only
532520	537340	reason I go to that grody Lee a plausible thing grody Lee grody Lee
537340	544980	plausible grody Lee plausible where have you been you're my favorite woman
544980	552740	says 1910 you got hips of liberation and a suffragette I don't know grody Lee
552740	559020	plausible what is that song what is it what am I thinking of mr. Belviter it's
559020	565500	like a schoolhouse rock thing or something like I don't know so the fact
565500	572460	that he was so quickly irritated by my mentioning it means it wasn't a bit if
572460	576500	the bet is yeah I'm Ron Jeremy I have a banana peel on my right shoulder and
576500	581260	someone points I guess yeah oh it's scary there's a way to make that a bit
581260	587100	now church has a photo of peaches opening a bit she had a banana after the
587100	591820	show me here's benefit of the doubt which still doesn't explain his weird
591820	599340	rancor and irritability was that he saw peaches eating the banana took the
599340	604140	banana peel maybe had her sign it I don't know and then put it on his
604140	607500	shoulder though because he's a clean freak it doesn't want to shake people's
607500	610660	hands with a banana peel in there or she put it on his shoulder I don't know who
610660	619100	this peaches is but it's like church is shaking her head oh so the peaches
619100	623180	banana was after the Ron Jeremy banana okay good so I don't have to extend any
623180	630540	more benefits of any doubts Ron Jeremy was doing some sort of surreal like
630540	635740	artistic display because it's not weird enough that he's Ron Jeremy and looks
635740	639740	like he's I think there's also like you we're making the assumption that the
639740	645060	rancor has to do with the banana peel but if we if you think about what it
645060	649420	must be like to be Ron Jeremy there's probably a super high percentage that at
649420	655180	any given moment at a gathering that has any kind of like hip quotient to it or
655180	658980	well let's just say any gathering because like that because he's a porn
658980	664100	star because we're awful rude to our our porn stars we are we're like we treat
664100	667740	them like garbage we treat pornography like garbage we use it all and blah blah
667740	671740	blah I won't get on that soapbox but you know the people in Los Angeles that
671740	676140	have performed in porn that are recognizable as such I'm sure that just
676140	682420	as like I don't know women of color or like got really tall dudes or anything
682420	685060	anything any person that has anything really specific about them is probably
685060	689020	they're probably on a higher risk of just having had some kind of encounter
689020	693700	they really just pissed them pissed them off you know and it like somebody
693700	698900	somebody for the 800th time this week like asked him some question that or said
698900	703140	phrased something in a way or like he's become convinced that like there's
703140	705740	certain kinds of people that refuse to shake his hand because they're afraid
705740	709940	they'll get HPV or something and he he's connecting dots in his head maybe he was
709940	715700	like on his way out and it's like I got my banana peel and then Michael J Fox
715700	718860	said that fucking shitty thing that somebody always says and I fuck I'm
718860	723020	leaving yeah but like if you're gonna be walking that that razor's edge of
723020	727340	crankiness because somebody recently had said something that was kind of
727340	732140	diminishing or rude then don't be a famous porn star too late no no be a
732140	737460	famous porn star be in a bad mood don't have a banana peel and don't let that be
737460	742500	the thing that switches you off no but I'm saying my my pitch is that it's not
742500	745620	what switched him off right you caught him you caught a famous person in a bad
745620	750500	mood and hey the banana you may as well have said you're wearing two shoes yes
750500	758100	okay okay I see that but he was having a good time it's not the first time I've
758100	760660	been in the same room with Ron Jeremy I've walked by him because he's always
760660	765100	in that same he's always at the Rainbow Grill bar and grill I've never hung out
765100	768340	with him I've never been in close confines with him so it is my first real
768340	774100	Ron Jeremy encounter and I wasn't gonna go up to him and say hey Ron Jeremy can
774100	777420	I get a photo with you because it's not always my style unless it's Keith David
777420	781660	from the other night which I was very happy about yeah no but outcomes razor I
781660	786300	if I had to bet my life I would I would go with your the grottily plausible
786300	791100	thing which is that he he does this thing where he puts a banana peel on
791100	797620	his shoulder and if a hot woman asks him where's the banana banana peel on
797620	801500	your shoulder he's like that's right because if you want to see the banana
801500	805220	you got to come to the bathroom yeah yeah yeah that was my first instinct
805220	810940	yeah but but then I go like why is he coming up with well why is he coming up
810940	815900	with that shit isn't he a human banana on society's shoulder like banana peel
815900	822940	and and and and like but so wouldn't that time is it isn't aren't you Ron
822940	829220	Jeremy enough yeah and then I think well maybe not because he whatever the lead
829220	833820	up to that is whatever it is maybe maybe someone our listeners are gonna go and
833820	837620	Google this and find out that this is a long-running thing that there is a
837620	841860	hilarious bit but like he's doing a deep track Ron Jeremy joke that only
841860	846340	certain people in that room would have got but he had garbage on his shoulder
846340	854300	and didn't have a sense of humor about it which confused I mean I that's gonna
854300	858420	confuse me for a long time yeah and I feel like I have to do the little
858420	864780	asterisk here my little Stanley box in the corner where I come up in the bottom
864780	869940	and say by the way web heads I don't I don't if you're if you're a friend with
869940	875380	a with a with a porn star or you are a porn star you listen please don't feel
875380	880700	like I don't think we're just talking about Ron Jeremy like I when I hear
880700	884180	people talk about porn stars and podcasts like I feel like like you know
884180	889620	it's like I'm not judging Ron Jeremy this isn't about judging him this is
889620	895060	judging a weird it's him being a porn star doesn't doesn't weigh into this at
895060	900260	all it could have been any anybody that is worth mentioning because people know
900260	908220	his name right or her name if I saw Pam Anderson or you know Bruno Mars walking
908220	911820	around with a fucking banana on the shoulder and that same thing happened
911820	917580	that's interesting to me Spencer how are you great hey guys you guys hear
917580	922940	about these Chinese murder bands I've only heard them mentioned but what do
922940	927460	you got for us well they're like these vans in China and they come and they get
927460	930940	people and then they just kill them in the vans are these people that they have
930940	934060	contracts out on or they just randomly killing strangers I think they're
934060	940100	randomly killing people who the state says they can kill you can hear the
940100	943040	scratch of Jeff's ballpoint pennies taking notes he does that during the
943040	948780	live show too I always wonder what he takes notes during the show which is
948780	952420	really impressive to me I also now that we're doing this quote-unquote single
952420	956260	camera style I think I think one of the neat things I was thinking of like you
956260	960820	could you could pretend like like you're really smart like you could just be like
960820	971980	hey you know here we should talk about Charles you can hear Dan typing wait I'm
971980	974940	not done with Chinese murder vans you know he's an American convicted mass
974940	978020	murderer and former cult leader who led what became known as the man you can
978020	981180	just be like you could sound a lot smarter than you are when you're not
981180	985860	doing a live performance you could do research yeah so often have laptops set
985860	989260	up for just such occasions so these Chinese murder vans are state-run
989260	993940	murder vans or these are freelancers no they I think they're freelancers that
993940	999740	are employed by like a house painter yeah right no I think their government
999740	1003000	run they're they're like police like you might have a like a paddy wagon but
1003000	1006600	instead of they put you in the van then they kill you and they kill you like
1006600	1012100	bride brides handmaids tail and bridesmaids tail bridesmaids tail
1012460	1020820	handmade revisited always a bridesmaids tail so they just they're this is a real
1020820	1024820	thing of just driving around picking up people yeah wait here's my here's my
1024820	1029980	thing 27 dresses as a bridesmaids tail you you see you see a murder van come
1029980	1034260	and don't get in that van oh yeah no they pull you in there I like the theory
1034260	1038380	that murder a Chinese murder van is just a racist phrase for an ambulance the bad
1038380	1043300	murder van yeah what was that joke book you had do we ever talk about that yeah
1043300	1047980	yeah the racist joke book yeah that all of the Chinese things are backwards and
1047980	1052020	all the Mexican things are like diminished yeah yeah we've talked about
1052020	1055140	that a lot you know look we also have Steve Levy sitting in the booth with us
1055140	1058500	listen let's not pretend that Steve Levy is not here I don't know what aren't we
1058500	1064020	trying to recreate the stage feel but like I think what you know I don't want
1064020	1067820	to acknowledging Steve Levy but okay how about this look I want the audience to
1067820	1070980	know Steve Levy sitting here but we're gonna still bring him out for yeah yeah
1070980	1074540	yeah because we're gonna try to play D&D later and which I think I could which I
1074540	1080460	can only assume is gonna go a lot better dot dot dot question mark because I
1080460	1084220	guess better meaning that we're gonna find out that Jeff and I are bad at
1084220	1088300	playing because it will be more like the authentic stuff like nerd poker yeah on
1088300	1093420	ear wolf where we're really just playing D&D and there's no way for us to fall
1093420	1097580	back on well also you only brought the one vodka in we don't have the bottle
1098220	1102420	vodka on this in the room however another advantage of this format is I
1102420	1106540	can I can press pause walk out get a drink and I could teleport to a state of
1106540	1113420	drunkenness so extremely you can shut the tape this podcast was designed to
1113420	1117660	make you want to reach in and grab yeah I mean I you know what's funny is I was
1117660	1123900	just I was getting so I don't want to say the phrase sick of doing the live
1123900	1128260	podcast because I don't want anybody that's been a fan to feel like like
1128260	1131460	there's a betrayal there anything like that like we've been doing the podcast
1131460	1136260	for a really long time it's been a live show I just I'm just saying like I'm
1136260	1139220	saying this is a positive thing like I was getting to a place where I was
1139220	1143380	really starting to ask myself and this has been a slow build since November all
1143380	1146700	of you listening you're probably you've had your own little transitional stories
1146700	1152100	like where you're dealing with fucking shit which is and it's a it's a like like
1152180	1159060	a part of my thing was what is dinging to your iPad land bank associated smart
1159060	1168380	devices let's get him on FaceTime Dan's FaceTiming Charles Manson um it my thing
1168380	1172420	I kept I was starting to ask myself like why am I doing this show because I'm not
1172420	1178540	like I've grown sour on like oh this thing where I stand in front of a
1178540	1181540	microphone and I kind of kvetch about how I don't want people to tell me the
1181540	1184660	time I shoes and I wish I was on the moon where no one could bother me and a
1184660	1187460	street shouldn't be curvy they should be straight and all this stuff that was
1187460	1191140	like it was it was working really well and it was like it was working really
1191140	1197420	well under a liberal bureaucratic technocratic like regime where everything
1197420	1201420	was kind of great and I didn't have to acknowledge that it was great because I
1201420	1204740	could be a rebel because everything was running in an Orwellian Lee smooth way
1204740	1210220	and but and yet a very backward bureaucratically like absurd way so I
1210220	1216940	could just decry life's absurdities and society's little intricate wrongdoings
1216940	1220860	and things and and be a hero to myself and pat myself in the back and then the
1220860	1224740	election happens and all the women are crying and I'm like buying a gun and I'm
1224740	1228540	like I'm like and we're all worried that there's like Nazis in the streets and
1228540	1233340	it's like politics are now like real life they're as real to us as as our
1233340	1236660	black friends are telling us they've always been like or in our female
1236660	1240340	friends are telling us and and and that intersects with all this talk that we
1240340	1246180	were having blah blah blah blah blah all of that leads to me at 44 almost a year
1246180	1251300	past November I I'm like why am I what why am I doing this show where I get up
1251300	1255440	every week and I'm like babbling into a microphone like I'm angry now and I'm
1255440	1260580	fragile and I'm scared and all this stuff and I but I was also going I've
1260580	1265780	been doing this show for years I would be a really stupid unhealthy person if I
1265780	1271540	if I changed radically anything about something that had been building for
1271540	1278900	five years and growing with in the span of anything less than six months you
1278900	1282420	know like being asking these questions over a period of weeks and weeks and
1282420	1285660	weeks is just not enough so I just that's why I was kind of like I've been
1285660	1290660	building in my anxiety and and like and showing up to these shows and you've
1290660	1294700	heard me being like maybe you haven't picked up on it maybe you have but but
1294700	1299300	like that I'm like you know I just like sometimes I'm yelling at the audience
1299300	1302580	sometimes I'm not it was all manifestation of that thing and isn't it
1302580	1307780	interesting how this shit then just happens like like now I feel now there's
1307780	1312300	no audience here so I can just talk about God and throw your shoe at your
1312300	1316340	laptop all you want you you you you beautiful atheist who we need to further
1316340	1322140	our society but I I there's it's like it just feels like the universe just kind
1322140	1327540	of makes this shit happen like I was I had a kind of sense of relief when I got
1327540	1330420	texted that the fire marshal shut the show down because I was like oh that's
1330420	1335100	gonna take a long time to rectify we might have to do our show the way my
1335100	1338420	favorite murder does it the way Duncan Trussell does it this could be a really
1338420	1342780	fun thing like like this could be a shot of vitamin B in the in the in the
1342780	1347640	show's arm we can do different stuff with this now I don't know I mean you
1347640	1351180	guys seem kind of stoked about it Spencer's look at that look at that big
1351180	1356340	smiling face oh yeah well the truth is that when you're in front of an audience
1356340	1361460	if I look this blank everyone would be like angry and confused and like what's
1361460	1365300	up his ass but that's kind of my neutral face so now you know I'm free to just
1365300	1370300	let it go and not like smile and nod occasionally to pretend that I'm like you
1370300	1377420	know still with it and and keeping up and doing the live show being a live
1377420	1384020	podcast has its ups and downs like when the show is good it awesome it often is
1384020	1390460	because of the fact that there was a the crowd interaction made it good but
1390460	1394060	sometimes it suffers because of that like if it's not a guarantee that it
1394060	1397380	makes it better or worse yeah I also kind of wonder because I had this dream
1397380	1403860	of like moving from meltdown into the the the castle and that we would then be
1403860	1406780	able to do this like feedback loop that I was obsessed about where we could have
1406780	1409860	people tweeting and then I could answer the tweets and you could show shit to
1409860	1415460	blah blah blah I like I thought it would I thought it would happen more
1415460	1419060	automagically than than it did it turns out if I really want that to happen I
1419060	1422220	have to start producing like a visual show and the more visual it gets the
1422220	1426060	more alienating it would have gotten to our listeners etc so there was a lot of
1426060	1429820	incentive or non incentive to not move in that direction once we got to the new
1429820	1434620	venue so it starts to occur to me as we're sitting here I'm like well yeah
1434620	1440660	pump out your audio podcast and we'll and we can Howard Stern it Joe Rogen it
1440660	1446020	by bringing the live stream cameras in here isn't that more valuable to people
1446020	1449940	and can't you do all the shit that I'm talking about where you go hey if you're
1449940	1453300	watching you know remember when Howard Stern it is an EU show it's like you
1453300	1457980	just have cameras we could even make them permanently like mount it up in here
1457980	1461540	and use them when we want to use Greg Proops on smartest man in the world
1461540	1468020	podcast he does a lot of live shows and then he does just like audio from his
1468020	1473580	house or wherever he is like if he's in a hotel room from the the fortress
1473580	1480100	of purpitude or he calls it the porpoise of fortitude and I like the change I
1480100	1484660	like sometimes hearing the crowd but sometimes the live shows have bad audio
1484660	1488540	and they're kind of crap because like the technical difficulties and sometimes
1488540	1493260	I just like hearing Greg just monologue into a microphone yeah in a
1493260	1496460	controlled environment I think is we got more comfortable in here anyways whatever
1496460	1499860	so don't start freaking out oh I hope they don't do this I hope that we're
1499860	1503300	obviously we're gonna do what feels right but I'm just I'm just I'm just
1503300	1508900	sharing my current I'm I think this is I think it's cool this is the right time
1508900	1513580	for a change to come along for me whether it's temporary permanent or or
1513580	1519220	it causes some kind of weird fission where we have the podcast but then you
1519220	1524740	know when we do have live shows Los Angeles or not then we dive into the
1524740	1530260	privilege of okay it's gonna be a live show we're gonna have slides and yeah
1530260	1535300	cartoons and fucking tap dances and so make make a dog tricks make the live
1535300	1540100	shows more event-based and say there's a reason we're doing it and charge 20 bucks
1540100	1544020	a ticket and give it to Planned Parenthood and you do you have one show
1544020	1553380	all you you invite only fire marshals that is that is it Steve is that called
1553380	1557420	a minion if there's if there's at least nine fire marshals we can we can create
1557420	1566340	we could rewrite fire fire code yeah oh shit Steve leave everybody thanks for
1566340	1571980	having me applause break can you guys talk to people we will I go get a drink
1571980	1577460	that's some good applause or do I pull the ultimate dick move and make Steve go
1577460	1581460	give me a drink no you go get your own drink it's your studio Dan has to walk
1581460	1585780	30 feet to go to the from from his recording studio to his lounge because
1585780	1589100	if you don't know the Starburns Industries has its own bar where all the
1589100	1594020	meetings take place and it's quite nice it is Dan make me a little something
1594020	1597660	would you what do you want yeah surprise me I'll have what you're
1597660	1607300	having leave me with new oh you know you've had a long 48 hours 72 hours yeah
1607300	1612220	I don't even know anymore I'm so tired crisis averted though for now cuz when
1612220	1617820	we got shut down on Saturday night yeah at right before 8 o'clock yeah there was
1617820	1623260	audience already seated right oh yeah and were you there I was you were there
1623380	1628140	yeah and people were already getting drinks from the bar they were yeah and
1628140	1633500	then the fire marshal shut the thing down and then you had to you and who
1633500	1640060	Brian from Nolan who really champ was a champion and Chris Boroff yeah and so
1640060	1648220	you guys at midnight had to find a new venue oh go scouting for that yeah it
1648220	1653320	was a yeah after we got shut down we figured try to figure out what we can do
1653320	1657700	we had a lot of conversations Nolan and Chris had to deal with the castle stuff
1657700	1664060	I contacted our whole team for ricking Morty to see because the next night on
1664060	1666900	Sunday night is Rick ricking Morty if you don't know what that is that's a big
1666900	1673900	like live adult swim streamed event with paid people like guests and stuff yeah
1673900	1677940	you talk about the record yeah watch the episode live so that and that's a
1677940	1682740	big deal and that was must have been an expensive and time-consuming move yeah
1682740	1688020	I mean what do you do when you lose your venue less than 24 hours from showtime
1688020	1697100	and you have an entire set you have to move so yeah we thank him bearing gifts
1697100	1702620	like you know first person I call was Jen Roskin who is an amazing producer here
1702620	1710460	at Starburns and she she started helping me out try to find a place I
1710460	1713620	finally got in touch with Brian Baldinger who books there's a talent
1713620	1719380	producer on the show and he Brian's got the beard right yeah yeah yeah he he
1719380	1726100	found someone with a space and he and I scouted it at like 2 in the morning and
1726100	1729300	we just had to pull the trigger because we couldn't find anything else it was
1729300	1733940	gonna be really expensive but we need to the last time I saw you that worn out
1733940	1737300	and tired was like during Harmon quest I think when you you were being sleepy
1737300	1741060	leavy on a couch yeah there there are times where it just gets really
1741060	1748660	exhausting I just start like barely he's a sleepy leavy he'll take a catch on some
1748660	1759540	they take a couch he'll take a nap on your they'll take a nap someone sofa he's
1759540	1766620	not a loafer he's just a little sleepy from his job I mean he's the kind of guy
1766620	1772660	that works hard he breaks him like a glass shard he's the kind of leavy who's
1772660	1779140	a sleepy old leavy he's no don't try to tell him to work less just he's
1779140	1784740	worthless without his job he's got no family for any listeners that thought
1784740	1788340	that Dan's freestyle abilities would suffer from not having the energy of a
1788340	1793020	live audience I think we found out that right and Phil Collins you check is on
1793020	1802300	the way so yeah how's uh have you recovered emotionally from the the
1802300	1807620	girl situation yeah I mean still going I'm just no I yeah no I'm I don't know
1807620	1815700	I'm I had a lot of work fire so that really took a lot out of me and the last
1815700	1821700	couple days were horrible because of the Vegas thing and Tom Petty yeah I'm real
1821700	1825420	hard things getting dark and to the point where the news story is how dark
1825420	1832060	things have gotten like like and not in a cool way like I feel like now like it
1832140	1836900	because we can't communicate effectively or honestly with ourselves as a nation
1836900	1843740	about about how worthless human life has become we are now like the mainstream
1843740	1849220	media not to sound like a fucking jag off living in the woods but the
1849220	1857320	mainstream media stream Petey poop I noticed it maybe this is a refraction
1857320	1862360	or factors a distortion in some way but I now this is what I'm feeling as I'm
1862360	1866400	looking at the news when I if I just type Las Vegas after I hear about this
1866400	1873520	shooting I see what I see is a nation that immediately is just talking about
1873520	1880160	talking about it which is really disturbing to me that that it's like we
1880160	1886440	immediately leapt to how many famous women are responding inappropriately
1886560	1890760	which is like it has become the new theme like like we're like we're almost
1890760	1897440	verging on some kind of lists Australian gender gap where we don't like we wait
1897440	1902680	for the if you're a woman and you have a voice like now we've just gotten so like
1902680	1905880	when the rubber hits the road we just want you to shut the fuck up like like
1905880	1910320	like 58 people died and this maybe it's a coincidence maybe these are all just
1910320	1912960	coincidentally female people but if you're a female politician you're a
1912960	1915640	female comedian a female comedy writer it seems like you couldn't say anything
1915640	1919800	right about any of this which is really disturbing to me because it seems like
1919800	1924000	the alternative to responding inappropriately to a to a breaking a
1924000	1928920	world record for massacres after we have already decided to 20 kindergarteners who
1928920	1933680	have hearts the size of a bullet it wasn't enough you know do you really how
1933680	1940320	long do you expect people to maintain their the the the the gears and valves
1940320	1944500	that it takes to bow your head and take a moment of silence when human life is
1944500	1950260	wasted like and then and then the unconscious answer to that which really
1950260	1953980	terrifies me is oh they don't expect anything they want this to be like
1953980	1957900	carousel and Logan's run like they want it to be a ritual where we keep
1957900	1963300	sacrificing human life and then we keep on and then it's like who's gonna fart
1963300	1967660	first who's gonna break the silence let's all bow our heads and hum the
1967660	1972300	national anthem quietly while we talk about how our thoughts and prayers are
1972300	1976020	happening and then the moment a Saturday Night Live writer off-duty on
1976020	1982380	Twitter or a female senator or it you know a professional tweeter or blogger
1982380	1988260	says something that is effective because maybe it's satirical maybe it's biting
1988260	1995300	maybe it's a little inconvenient to hear however long after the final bullet
1995300	2000700	expends another American life that that happens then we then then we get to tie
2000700	2005660	that person to a stake and shame them like and poor gasoline all over their
2005660	2010940	feet and play with matches and like it's just like it's not I'm not trying to
2010940	2015340	wait night like like I just I do happen to notice that it's it always seems to
2015340	2019980	be women I just that's a call that a side order of intersectionality or
2019980	2025660	whatever but uh like I'm overall so fucking deeply troubled by the numbness
2025660	2029340	that I felt when I heard about this and then the and then the data that hit my
2029340	2035580	eyeballs when I googled it and how the theme seemed to be that we were being
2035580	2041780	chastised by our own technocracy for responding inappropriately whether it was
2041780	2047740	not responding at all or responding with biting wit responding with political
2047740	2051620	pleas to please stop this I can't believe we're still having this
2051620	2057060	conversation I can't believe people have the balls to say I know it's three
2057060	2062500	minutes after the last shell casing hits the floor is not too soon to talk
2062500	2067260	about fucking gun control you fucking heartless piece of shit like I don't
2067260	2071140	care if the families of the victims want to wait a hundred years to talk about
2071140	2075300	anything they're the families of the victims that's not that's not who we are
2075300	2080740	we're a nation who has its heartbroken how about this is way too many years
2080740	2085780	after Sandy Hook to talk about fucking gun control I'm a gun owner I still want
2085780	2090420	to talk about it do you want my gun back like like like let's talk about it
2090420	2095980	like gun sales go up when these massacres happen that is such a mind
2095980	2099780	fuck even if you're not politically motivated forget about red sides and
2099780	2103740	blue sides that's us that's such a philosophical mind fuck gun stocks like
2103740	2112300	boomed gun sales like imagine like so 9-11 didn't cause skyscraper sales to go
2112300	2118780	up it's this is like a unique disease we have and it's really frightening how
2118780	2123300	logical it is that everyone keeps erupting into these mass shootings and
2123300	2128180	then every time a mass shooting happens everyone runs out and buys guns because
2128180	2131780	they're afraid that guns will become illegal because someone used them bad
2131780	2138620	again the day before the what was the Vegas thing on Saturday Sunday Sunday
2138620	2142380	and so on Saturday whatever the day the day before the event was I've been to
2142380	2146740	that festival cuz Chip Esten my friend has played that festival before and I
2146740	2150660	was backstage and hung out and it was really fun met a bunch of people met
2150660	2153780	Jason Aldean and this guy named Jay Jackson who's a guitar player in that
2153780	2158460	band he had texted me the day before saying hey we're doing that festival
2158460	2161780	route 91 harvest festival do you want to come out and I'll get you tickets I
2161780	2168020	thought I can't I have a thing to go to and the next day that happened and it
2168020	2172420	was his band that was on stage when the bullets were flying and I texted him I
2172420	2177060	said how you doing and he goes where he said we were on stage when the bullets
2177060	2181580	were peppering the stage and we all had to dive off the back or to the side to
2181580	2185620	hide and then run during the pauses that this guy was taking while either
2185620	2189860	reloading or whatever he's doing and they all made it out all right but like
2189860	2194660	and then church your sister what like that has a best friends you know who
2194660	2204460	got yeah my my sister's friend was at the show with her friends and they all
2204460	2208100	ran and I guess they flagged down a car and this person was nice enough to just
2208100	2213820	drive them all all the way home and when she got home it was only then that she
2213820	2219060	realized that she was covered in someone else's blood so you have to think of how
2219060	2223860	close she must have been to actually getting hit because she was near enough
2223860	2229500	to someone who was to have that blood splatter on her and everyone's just so
2229500	2233420	disturbed by that it's a nauseating thought I thought what because I wonder
2233420	2240300	how many of those fatalities are trampling yeah I think a lot I mean if
2240300	2245020	you've ever seen that well whatever I saw a photo I saw like a slide photo
2245020	2249660	thing on Reuters like of the images of it and there are people hiding and it's
2249660	2254780	the exact same tent area that I would have been in like that where that where
2254780	2258300	I know I would have been if I were at that show no no this is not me making it
2258300	2262940	about me but like I did just because I can physically picture the layout there
2262940	2267740	there's no way out because you're fenced in there and there's only a couple
2267740	2271540	exits because they want to control the comings and goings there so there really
2271540	2276500	was nowhere for people to go as far as I can imagine because I remember trying
2276500	2281620	to go out and get somebody in there's only a couple little like small egresses
2281620	2286540	there yeah well that's a that's a theme with terrorism is like you know they're
2286540	2291420	taking advantage of slaughterhouse like environments created by capitalism but
2291420	2294980	then it wasn't terrorist because he was a white guy he's a lone wolf he's not he
2294980	2299020	can't be a terrorist and by that it makes me crazy just want to pause in our
2299020	2303780	dialogue to address the the folks out there that are going oh I thought this
2303780	2308980	would be the podcast that didn't talk about this hey how about this topic suck
2308980	2315580	my dick fucking jag off like fuck you and I can't say kill yourself because
2315580	2319980	it's too much fucking death but like fuck off into the night and suck suck
2319980	2324580	your own balls and fucking till they fall off and roll down a hill and fucking
2324580	2328900	end up in a steamer trunk and just leave my life with your fucking judgment get
2328900	2332380	out of my head you're not entitled to anything you do nothing you're you're a
2332380	2337380	fucking jerk you're a piece of shit you're a fucking garbage person you you
2337380	2341740	you how why are you listening to my podcast and then and then picking and
2341740	2345780	choosing what you like and don't like about it fuck you I already have my
2345780	2348780	older brother's voice in my head I have the voice of every fucking bully on the
2348780	2354820	playground I fucking I come out here to Los Angeles I do the hard work of
2354820	2360020	becoming a fat blowhard that owns a microphone and and you know how hard it
2360020	2365020	is for me to spout nonsense into a microphone without having to think about
2365020	2380620	your judgment I I'm a I'm a I'm a troubled man that was the weirdest sports
2380620	2385980	corner I've ever done I don't know I thought don't you feel compelled to have
2385980	2390100	like a little like like they add like like I said because it's like are you
2390100	2394260	worried that like as with the D&D segment that will play that it's like
2394260	2398260	the absence of the audience it feels simultaneously refreshing and also like
2398260	2403540	oh shit are we a creature that was breathing audience water and like then
2403540	2407780	when you put us in this terrarium out of our aquarium like now we look like a
2407780	2412100	floppy weird it's like everyone's gonna notice that we are boring the only
2412100	2415900	thing that's disturbing me is that Spencer is exactly the same he hasn't
2415900	2419140	changed it he Spencer just sits there it'll be amazing if I just like lean
2419140	2425940	back and I was made out of cardboard almost motionless but you like it more
2425940	2428340	now you said which is kind of surprising I could have thought it would be the
2428340	2431900	other way around where Spencer sitting there think realizing he's going oh man
2431900	2436860	my deadpan thing like it it really works in front of an audience and now I now
2436860	2440260	I'm just a guy that's not saying anything but you like not saying
2440260	2444820	anything and what you don't like is the feeling feeling pressured to say things
2444820	2447820	and you feel more pressured in front of an audience right that's one of the
2447820	2454020	competing theories at the moment Steve just walked out yeah what does that mean
2454020	2461380	our entire audience just left yeah take a giant shit oh when he gets back let's
2461380	2465980	let's play a lot of D&D but like let's really get a good hunk of D&D sure sure
2465980	2469100	like let me whatever man I'm still mad at that guy that didn't want us to talk
2469100	2474220	about the shooting what guy that guy they're still contacting you know I was
2474220	2478420	in my head the guy in your head oh well if the guy in your head is telling you
2478420	2482660	that that's you telling yourself that no it's the part of me it's the part of me
2482660	2486580	that's an unemployed flannel-wearing golden retriever owner in the middle of
2486580	2492180	America that that is calls himself a graphic designer but really is just a
2492180	2499140	freelance douchebag and who sits and listens to the podcast while he
2499140	2505460	masturbates which is a weird move but and and and kind of put to toodles
2505460	2510220	around on like mindmap software you know what it's me it's me I just described me
2510220	2513140	it's just too hot to wear flannel you masturbate while listening to Harman
2513140	2516740	town and I have a golden doodle I like I changed only what he doesn't have to
2516740	2521980	Harman town is masturbation that's part of what's so weird about it is me I
2521980	2524980	don't know I'm picturing a really specific dude that's like he's got one
2524980	2531060	tattoo okay and it's like okay cuz he's like just a little more back of the
2531060	2535780	shoulder now forearm top of the forearm and it's like a tribally thing and and
2535780	2541960	and he's any any really rough houses with his dog like like well he just like
2541960	2546660	wrestles with it like the dog thinks he's a dog and and and he like throws it like
2546660	2550660	raw meat and shit and like like tries to take it from him and they both eat the
2550660	2556180	raw meat in their backyard and he he owns a snowmobile and he like I don't
2556180	2560340	know he just and then and then if you're talking is he in a snowy region yeah
2560340	2564820	he's just eccentric he lives in a place he likes to take it up to Big Bear if he
2564820	2567460	lives somewhere warm because he can maybe came somewhere warm because he
2567460	2570980	decided in the tundra that he lives in that he's a graphic designer so he came
2570980	2573260	to LA maybe but it brought his snowmobile because he likes to go up to
2573260	2579340	Big Bear but he he like he's it's just like he loves beer he loves like 900
2579340	2582540	different kinds of beer thinks that beer is like a thing that you should
2582540	2586860	experience every different kind of flavor of and then and that's fine that's
2586860	2591180	all good but when you if you go to his public house that he likes to drink at
2591180	2594220	and then once he gets three beers in him he starts he starts saying some fucked
2594220	2598020	up libertarian shit that that you're like you kind of like bite your lip and
2598020	2603340	go like yeah because you don't want to argue with him right but he's like just
2603340	2608500	he's just like throwing out like like like at the top of his brain he's like
2608500	2613180	he's like making these observations about like how all lives should matter
2613180	2618180	instead of just the black lives and you're just kind of like
2618180	2623300	how did I end up drinking with you am I getting heartburn from this beer and you
2623300	2628020	suck you fucking suck I just know we're never gonna get along you know like and
2628020	2630780	I'm gonna end up auditioning for you and I'm gonna slowly slide into your
2630780	2634300	ideology because I can recognize the logic behind it but I don't feel it
2634300	2640900	myself I don't want it I don't want to talk to you you're too bro-y so stop
2640900	2645900	listening to my podcast man like like or listen to it if you're that guy but like
2645900	2650460	everything when you listen to me just like just how could that guy listen to
2650460	2655980	this podcast I mean like how likely is that because he's not totally stupid and
2655980	2659700	he likes smart stuff or something I don't know and like we're not like
2659700	2664060	bleeding heart whatever is like but that's what he that's why he's hated the
2664060	2667700	podcast since November because then now I'm starting to sound like all the shit
2667700	2672380	that he hates because I now I'm like freaked out cuz I used to be a full-blown
2672380	2677620	anarchist and now I'm now I'm like a Democrat basically because I gave for
2677620	2680740	the time being cuz I can't cuz that's the lever I keep pulling because I'm so
2680740	2685100	scared of fascism I just keep pulling the lever that says don't let fascists
2685100	2690140	win so and it's like that's the fucking system man that's the game and that
2690140	2694340	which is what I used to say so if if I have four years of my podcast I have
2694340	2698580	dudes like that that like started to like build up like I don't I shouldn't
2698580	2702460	be surprised but I'm just saying like let's have a reckoning here guys like
2702460	2706620	if you're that dog wrestling dude and you feel that way like you don't have to
2706620	2712860	leave or stay but like can you do me the favor of of like looking at at at your
2712860	2719820	time with me as the inverse of when you go to the gym in other words like this
2719820	2723900	is your you should be more of a pussy time like like like like like where you
2723900	2729260	just like exercise your pussy muscles like like like where you acquiesce a
2729260	2733260	little bit more because I'm going through a fucking crisis about this shit
2733260	2736820	and I'm you've probably noticed I try to be honest about the fact I don't know
2736820	2742820	what I'm talking about and then I'm lazy and and hypocritical and and and
2742820	2747380	and whatever like I'm not I'm not I'm not ever gonna like decide what the
2747380	2751700	truth is and start barking it at you I'm just like always saying like this is
2751700	2756180	where I'm at at this moment could you take that ride with me without without
2756180	2761700	this fucking thing that drives me nuts that's all in my head I guess of like now
2761700	2765500	I don't like this podcast like like this idea that the podcast exists in some
2765500	2769980	dichotomy of like well that was good now it's bad like I can't fucking handle
2769980	2773620	thinking like that then you just Sony and then I want to fucking beat you with
2773620	2778020	a bat and I just want to let you know how much I hate you because for my own
2778020	2781860	integrity sake for the same reason ironically that you wrestle your dog and
2781860	2786260	don't like me because you don't want to be told what to do okay great so like
2786260	2790500	minus your dumb tattoo that you got like like we're basically the same flabby
2790500	2793540	fucking blowhard assholes you could probably beat me up in a fight you know
2793540	2799620	how to use a knife but you know what if you cut me scorpions come out is that
2799620	2802660	true yeah that's a little that's not a metaphor have you ever seen the original
2802660	2807420	Clash of the Titans like if you fucking cut me bro scorpions are gonna come out
2807420	2815420	of me giant ones but my blood will make giant how giant giant enough to fit
2815420	2819180	inside you know they start small watch Clash of the Titans the original all
2819180	2824340	right and they get bigger with Harry Hamlin as Perseus if you my blood if my
2824340	2828180	blood hits the ground little tiny scorpions form that then quickly grow
2828180	2834660	through the miracle of green screen to the size of mammoth if you cut me little
2834660	2839420	Burgess Meredith's come out that's now I'd like to talk about that is that from
2839420	2845780	Rocky no Burgess Meredith isn't Clash of the Titans oh yeah but he okay his
2845780	2849300	character whatever his character is from Clash of the Titans right but they're
2849300	2853300	like a bunch of little Burgess Meredith's and Toga's come out of me but
2853300	2856420	they don't get bigger so the character that you represent like I guess I'm
2856420	2861140	characterizing myself is that guy a cerebus sir sir not cerebus yes
2861140	2864940	Cerberus Cerberus or something like that like is a close because he's the guy with
2864940	2869620	the tail yeah he got he gets turn he like so I found an icon of that movie
2869620	2873420	and you're saying well whatever guy you are we don't know who it is but we know
2873420	2876900	he didn't get cut in the movie no he's kind of like the Obi-Wan Kenobi
2876900	2880500	mentoring guy oh wait a minute I'm sorry now there's a couple 45 year old people
2880500	2883860	throwing their shoes at the laptop because I just realized that guy is the
2883860	2888100	one who stabbed it's the man I'm the Medusa the Medusa's blood is what makes
2888100	2892300	the scorpions I believe oh yeah so it's been a long time so whoever you are you
2892300	2895460	might be the Kraken for all we know when you cut the Kraken Burgess Meredith's
2895460	2900220	come out we don't know cuz we didn't or a little metal owls that's only there's
2900220	2902700	three things I remember about that movie there was a Medusa there was a
2902700	2906900	three-headed thing and then there was the metal owl and then Burgess Meredith
2906900	2912060	and then from what I heard of the reboot in the reboot of class of the Titans
2912060	2917660	they're going through a trunk and one of the things that they pull out while
2917660	2920780	they're throwing garbage around is a little clockwork owl and the guy looks
2920780	2925020	at it and goes like what's this garbage what's this shit for real fuck this
2925020	2929020	garbage and he like shits on it and like rubs the shit into the eyes and then
2929020	2933500	pisses on it and to wash the shit out but then like throws it in a river that's
2933500	2938020	harsh and you're supposed to be like that's amazing because you're a fan of
2938020	2944540	class of the Titans and you hate the clockwork owl I don't I mean we'll never
2944540	2947300	understand that I know we've talked about that before but like at the end of
2947300	2950900	the Lone Ranger movie where it's like he's like hi ho and Tonto goes don't
2950900	2956140	dumb um here's some other don'ts don't fucking rewrite don't take the job
2956140	2960500	rewriting this movie if you hate like what the fuck is your problem I was
2960500	2965180	eating a pastrami sandwich in New York when I was a kid at stage deli and I'm
2965180	2969300	having my pastrami sandwich and I'm you know 10 or 11 years old fucking Burgess
2969300	2973660	Meredith walks by me down the street and I'd like I yelled out loud into a
2973660	2978740	restaurant class of the Titans he couldn't hear it all people do is it's a
2978740	2983340	love reel was just yelling out a name of a movie and no one saw that that Burgess
2983340	2989060	Meredith is going by then like the day before or the day after we saw Richard
2989060	2992980	Gere walking down the road and I could hear my mom ovulate like a show you
2992980	3002180	just she's like oh Cody got her period during an Annie DeFranco set and Lilith
3002180	3007620	fair is it Lilith fair you meet her first period yeah her friend yeah she
3007620	3011540	became a woman she dropped her first egg I don't know if that's accurate but that
3011740	3017940	she shed her first she yeah she got her period like yeah she she transitioned
3017940	3021700	from girlhood to womanhood during an Annie DeFranco song there's a girl I
3021700	3028140	knew I went to high school with that she her first orgasm was like at 12 or 13
3028140	3032860	years old at a Prince concert she was with her mother or father or both and
3032860	3036700	she was standing and she goes like I didn't know it was happening to me I was
3036700	3040980	watching this man perform and she realized later on she's oh no like I
3040980	3047020	came all right like she had a full-on Prince induced mind orgasm because I
3047020	3050620	was like yeah like I almost have an orgasm when I watch Prince like he's
3050620	3055180	fucking amazing there is an article about Prince when he died that where it
3055180	3063660	was like I think it was like from the point of view of trans it's what do you
3063660	3066700	what do you call it you can still call him drag queens right that's fine yeah
3066700	3069940	like I think it was like but I can't remember it that part I can't remember
3070020	3076420	whatever it was like sort of performers who who worked within the the the flux
3076420	3082740	the the outer edges of the binary world the heteronormative sphere and but they
3082740	3088900	were talking about like how Prince was this song that you know Prince was music
3088900	3092700	that like no matter what the song was it was always this song like Prince was
3092700	3096940	specialized the sonic waves that came from a Prince song were perfect at
3096940	3102100	turning straight straight people by or gay like like it was like like if you
3102100	3105900	were on the edge if you were curious like the thing that would that would get
3105900	3110100	you every time was like the Prince was making this music by intention or not
3110100	3114820	unconsciously that that was the energy that wasn't his sole purpose in the
3114820	3118380	world but that that was like something that was kind of known to DJ's and
3118380	3123020	strippers and things that sounds like Catholic propaganda well I mean yeah I
3123020	3126900	did but but but this was from a place of like these were people who were like
3126900	3130860	thankful for those properties they were like we could we could really put this
3130860	3140220	to some use Prince could sing the straightaway I mean he definitely yeah I
3140220	3143860	remember what my brother was five years old to me and like so in the 80s like
3143860	3147740	the androgynous revolution started to happen in Papa boy George and Prince and
3147740	3152740	and even heavy metal like if you could tell whether you were a boy or a girl it
3152740	3156780	was like a little bit to your discredit you know like you you really needed to
3156780	3161100	be like the even the mat the more you were more masculine if you were like
3161100	3164900	more like yeah there was more makeup and hairspray and high heels and yeah motley
3164900	3169420	crew kind of or like poison rather they kind of took it to the extreme is like
3169420	3172780	okay like you're going out of your way to be fake drag queens but I gotta
3172780	3175460	confess because my brother was five years older than me so I was a kid and I
3175460	3178260	was so I was like 10 years old when that was happening it was a little
3178260	3181740	intimidating to me that was too much sexuality for me it was sexuality I
3181740	3185620	didn't even know what sex I mean I knew what sex was sex was Pam Dauber from
3185620	3193220	Morgan Mindy sex was Penny from Inspector Gadget I was her age it sex was
3193220	3199460	like it was you know Linda Sheen Buckner you actually were there was arousal
3199460	3204940	because of Penny from Inspector Gadget no all right come on can we put it on
3204940	3210180	that yeah it's a yes or no question I was yeah dude I was like well I was
3210180	3214940	thinking I was when I when I was like 11 years old I hit this transition where I
3214940	3219300	started thinking of everything sexually like I one of my most common fantasies I
3219300	3224020	would like hump a pillow and think of myself as being Skeletor and thinking
3224020	3231460	about fucking either Tila or She-Ra from the human averse I guess because he
3231460	3234940	was a monster and like maybe because I would have I had like these blue
3234940	3239060	pajamas that were really tight cuz I had like I was sprouting so because I was
3239060	3241900	going through puberty so I had like these blue pajama bottoms that were
3241900	3246260	basically becoming tights because they were so small like they were made for a
3246260	3249500	little boy and I was becoming a man so I was like hulking out through my blue
3249500	3253100	pajamas so I and I something about like I had talked about this where I was like
3253100	3258500	I didn't want to touch myself but I was like getting so into like so I was just
3258500	3262460	humping everything and so there was like I also part of that was like I didn't
3262460	3266500	want to do it with my dick out so then I like wear these pajamas and I'm like in
3266500	3270140	blue tight pajama bottoms and I would think I just like got the visual cue
3270140	3273660	that I was like Skeletor okay because I was something that was on TV when I
3273660	3277460	would come home from school and then so then I was like you know what I'm saying
3277460	3284540	is like everything was sexual everything the charge of the Light Brigade peanuts
3284540	3289700	when I first started masturbating like maybe like maybe I was 12 ish you know
3289700	3293540	like when I first started perfecting the arts or beginning the the lifelong love
3293540	3299060	affair of masturbating there was I would go into the the bedroom the bat
3299060	3301860	the bathroom in our house I had a lock on the door cuz one didn't and one did
3301860	3310380	and there was a magazine that had a ad with Nadia Comunich the the gymnast and
3310380	3314300	it's like for like Haynes underwear or something like she was like like we're
3314300	3320100	kind of wearing like boy short underwear and that was the sexiest sexiest thing
3320100	3324980	in the world for me like I had like I hid that magazine like a treasure that
3324980	3329500	one picture of Nadia Comunich yeah I mean that was a big thing in the 80s big
3329500	3333140	people who grew up in our generation everybody knows about like the series
3333140	3338100	catalogs and stuff yeah pornography it's just hard to fathom for anybody that was
3338100	3341980	born in the internet when Victoria's Secret catalogs came along like this is
3341980	3347140	free sex I was like I can't believe that I'm on this mailing list how did they
3347140	3351860	all you have to do is just ask like why aren't they asking any questions you
3351860	3356060	know the answer is they don't care they were the merrier but it was that yeah I
3356060	3360140	felt it's like so funny that like there must be a huge generation gap for that
3360140	3362340	where people are like what are you talking about pornography is something
3362340	3366180	like it's like black mold it like grows in your walls why are you hoarding it in
3366180	3369780	a folder we used to like when we like Matt Gorley and I were young like we
3369780	3373980	were like maybe early early high school like freshman year there was a
3374340	3380300	someone found a penthouse like not the big full like Playboy size magazine
3380300	3385260	size penthouse like a smaller one that had like stories and it like penthouse
3385260	3391340	letters or whatever right I love the forum yeah yeah and we hit it under like
3391340	3397620	a and then and like a knoll like a knot of a tree and it was all covered in bugs
3397620	3404700	and just moisture we would like five guys we would run run home from school
3404700	3409980	to go to the tree and and unearth this horrible relic and sit there and just go
3409980	3415060	oh explain to modern moms like moms are 30 now and they're like kids to me
3415060	3418580	they're 14 years younger than me and they're their moms of kids who are
3418580	3424580	starting to they're catching their web history on the laptop YouTube like where
3424580	3430220	you can type in anything you want and and they're I try to assure them I'm
3430220	3433580	like it's a weird conversation because they'll express all this anxiety about
3433580	3437180	my kid the searching for this like how are you supposed to raise a kid healthy
3437180	3441340	in this environment where they can just type stuff I'm like and I and I and I
3441340	3445540	always respond by which I'm sure isn't reassuring them like everybody going
3445540	3449420	like hey look when I was a kid my YouTube was a pile of mud outside of
3450060	3454300	on a railroad track you know like we there was a printing company that made
3454300	3459180	hustler that then so like torn sheets of it would end up next to the crawdad pond
3459180	3465900	where we'd hunt for crawdad and like my generation learned about sex in in mud
3465900	3472380	and dirt and ladybugs and crawfish and I you ended up building a raft and going
3472380	3477900	down a river with a noble black and I think that that's bound to make you more
3477900	3485500	misogynistic more bent and closeted and therefore have a propensity for you know
3485500	3490740	just foot and mouth or in the worst case like actual you know aggressive behavior
3490740	3498300	I think that's that's I that's gotta be worse than growing up in a computerized
3498300	3502740	technocracy where you can type in vagina because you don't know how to spell it
3502740	3509540	yet and like it says do you mean vagina here's a hundred of them I mean it's
3509540	3512700	obviously what everyone's worried about it's like yeah but you can type in horse
3512700	3519060	fucking into YouTube and like it's it's like a kid can like like and it's like
3519060	3522860	so if they're exposed to all that stuff how can they grow up healthy and I you
3522860	3525980	know I don't I don't have the answers but these are people that type in horse
3525980	3529340	fucking because they want to watch two horses fucking that's that's that's their
3529340	3533220	jam I think the answer is yes I think that I think the fear is that the more
3533220	3538540	sex is demystified the more it becomes the it's there's an invitation to
3538540	3542780	sociopathology there and it makes it makes a gut level sense to us that if
3542780	3549100	your kid has access to an infinite database of sexuality that if you grew
3549100	3555380	up where with sex being precious and mysterious and marked by thresholds and
3555380	3561500	rites of passage and your kid is raised in a mainframe of sexual imagery isn't
3561500	3567340	your kid going to have more of a tendency to become Jeffrey Dahmer
3567340	3573860	because they'll look at all these boobs and vaginas and bestiality and gender
3573860	3579220	bending and blah blah blah and because they won't have any thresholds or rites
3579220	3586180	of passage about it then they'll they'll be they'll crave something more
3586180	3592740	flavorful which can only be any like the darkest things possible I understand the
3592740	3596260	logic of that the gut level emotional logic of that but if you really think
3596260	3599620	about it and I'm not saying I have the answers and that's all of society let's
3599620	3602980	do this experiment where we don't give a shit what kids do on the internet but
3602980	3606900	doesn't it also make sense that that's an inverted logical principle Spencer
3606900	3611140	don't you think that that's like a classic logical fallacy that that that
3611140	3619820	that if the kids are have access to more sex information that they will become
3619820	3625980	kinkier because what we're really saying is I had less access to sex
3625980	3630900	information and I'm only so kinky therefore my kid who has all sex
3630900	3634780	information will be kinkier than me that's a lot isn't there a label for
3634780	3639700	that fallacy I don't know I mean I think it's probably true I think the
3639700	3643900	internet is only reverse stigma in terms of sexual acts I don't think it's
3643900	3648540	really added any stigma to any sexual acts that hasn't been there before you
3648540	3652940	know so in a way the only thing that can happen is barriers being broken down and
3652940	3656780	thus people getting kinkier and kinkier right good but that's you know defined
3656780	3663300	like all the kinks must have been invented by now and there's people that
3663300	3668020	have been doing weird shit for you know pre-internet but one should one should
3668020	3672820	acknowledge the de morge perspective which was that because I was talking
3672820	3679180	about how don't you think porn like is like as much as we disrespect it it's
3679180	3685060	like it's the it's the tip of the spear in a cultural sense because when you
3685060	3690700	reduce all humanity to animalistic energy which does include this big black
3690700	3695940	studs gonna fuck these two white girls like they've never been fucked yes
3695940	3704700	you're you're animalizing the black dude but there's these women are not being
3704700	3710460	respected either elevated yeah and and and that everybody in a porno movie is
3710460	3716860	an animal and which is a state that you go into when you're jerking off and like
3716860	3720580	that I don't know that's what I was trying to explain in those episodes
3720580	3726140	which I keep thinking that's what she's to more joy but I do want to I just want
3726140	3732700	to say his point was actually whenever there's delineation that it doesn't
3732700	3735980	matter how progressive it looks to you I don't mean to put words into more just
3735980	3739540	mouth but that he I think what his point was is like whenever there's
3739540	3745580	acknowledgement of a black man being black basically you know like you're you
3745580	3750380	you may feel like it's better than than hitting him with a belt in a bar
3750380	3754380	because he's black but and that may be technically true but that it's a it's
3754380	3758860	also a fallacy to say looks like we're making progress in the porn world
3758860	3763140	because because they're because they're not saying you can't fuck because you're
3763140	3768580	that was my fat that was my fallacious observe I so I do I just wanted to like
3768580	3772940	make sure like I think I understand his point of view too which is like yeah okay
3772940	3778980	like like like until the until the day comes when porn is Martin Luther King
3778980	3784140	style ie everyone's just a person and nobody is being called like check out
3784140	3789940	this spicy Latina you know we're not we haven't made it anywhere and porn is
3789940	3793620	just important maybe not the tip of the spear maybe porn is just the jet stream
3793620	3798620	behind our fucking sluggish racist like ways well speaking of making porn
3798620	3802380	progress in the porn world let's make progress in the fantasy realm world
3802500	3807380	showing Jesus is it already that time we're 60 minutes and this is so easy if
3807380	3811860	I want to play a lot no no I'm just saying like fucking time burns dude when
3811860	3815660	you there's no audience you don't wait for their dumb asses to approve or
3815660	3819420	disapprove you do hate the audience you know how many fucking minds I just
3819420	3823060	stepped on talking about like spicy latinas in porn but I didn't say
3823060	3826460	anything offensive like there's a spicy latina listening who's like thank you
3826460	3833260	for saying that and do you think latinas like like like Latina women are
3833260	3837940	spicier than other races stop it I mean like what's your spice level on like
3837940	3842220	let's say like stop it my point is my exact point is that by the time I was
3842220	3847580	done with my thought allowed to complete it I had I I definitely like made it
3847580	3852560	clear that I was like on the right side of history if I was in front of an
3852560	3864840	audience they like they have they're like oh that's my least favorite person
3864840	3872200	is the fucking dude who just like goes I know I know I know I make that sound
3872200	3875760	sometimes I hear it too that's the thing and I what I hear it and I go oh fuck I
3875760	3880040	fucked up dude if that that guy's that cuz that sounds so fucking dismissive
3880760	3885920	you fucking idiot that's what that sounds like so if you may I know that I
3885920	3888520	know that you're if you're in the audience you made that sound I'm not
3888520	3894000	saying I hate you I'm just saying like fucking I'm just saying this is good for
3894000	3899720	me I the escaping from a couple of fucking like sounds that I have to
3899720	3903760	listen to in my desperate addiction to pleasing people this could be really
3903760	3910120	fair what the fuck did that mean do you guys remember the Mick gangbang I was
3910120	3914840	talking about the same with Spencer about this last weekend what the Mick
3914840	3919440	gang bangs this website called like secret menu calm and it basically just
3919440	3924040	oh it's a bunch of bullshit and it gave it all these crazy names and then
3924040	3928720	certain people like Steve act like it's like a legitimate thing and it's just
3928720	3932460	like a fucking idiot in Florida New York you were talking about it's not like an
3932460	3937460	established menu item but no what are you talking about it's a Mick double
3937460	3941620	there's a Mick double it was a Mick chicken inside of a Mick double yeah you
3941620	3945620	just put them into the same sandwich right and so it's certain drive-throughs
3945620	3949100	and things to the internet you can say can I get a Mick gang it's like it's
3949100	3952740	like bartending like you can say I get a blowjob shot but that doesn't mean that
3952740	3957060	the establishment that you're drinking at approves of the concept of a blowjob
3957060	3962740	or you know like you go I go like I'd like a I'd like a gangbang at a
3962740	3967260	McDonald's drive-through and the person might say what or they might say okay
3967260	3972500	got it yeah because it's a secret my favorite menu item at McDonald's is the
3972500	3986540	cancer well no what's let's resolve this well yeah I just want to just explain
3986540	3991380	some of this to you right because it's tough that you guys ought to be knowing
3991380	3999180	yeah so so wait help us help us I am okay it involves reading the treasure
3999180	4004020	because like right like okay so this is a bunch of stuff you've got most of this
4004020	4006940	isn't listed on your character sheets this is a bunch of stuff it's two
4006940	4010700	masterwork short swords two plus one daggers of sharpness one poison pill one
4010700	4014460	black dragon shard two stealthy leather armor two thousand silver pieces one
4014460	4018100	religious relic one secret message one book what to do in your church is under
4018100	4024340	attack right so these are all things you started oh I see it's the it's the
4024340	4027820	compiled list of stuff we've a vast majority of this stuff is stuff you
4027820	4032340	looted off the bodies of the assassin okay well what is it but not all what is
4032340	4035740	a black dragon shard do right exactly you don't necessarily know what that
4035740	4039860	does I'll tell you right now it's it's it's like a magical if a geode could be
4039860	4044420	magic it's like that so it's like they could be they could be found and then
4044420	4048580	they're like these magical stones that are just native to the planet so you
4048580	4052140	don't know exactly what it does because it's almost as if you just found like a
4052140	4055780	weird stone you know but it's it's something that exists okay it's not it's
4055780	4059540	not like a weapon like a yeah it's not okay the secret meant the religious
4059540	4063220	relic is what Tom fell gave you like a gift I have that right that's in your
4063220	4067180	yeah so maybe we should cross that off this and then the secret message was
4067180	4072020	found on the assassins it was written in a in a language that Dan divine was a
4072020	4076220	language used by merchants right that's the secret cuz they work for a guild or
4076220	4080060	something and passes to see you so you can look at it too all right so Spencer
4080060	4084460	do you want to work we're back where we're ready to play some D&D good and
4084460	4092740	proper here in the booth no audience Spencer you want you want to give us a
4092740	4096380	little recap because it's been a hundred years since we've played I really want
4096380	4100900	to be good at this I think a lot of those sheets might be obsolete we might
4100900	4111900	want to clean that folder I'm prioritizing okay well let's let's you
4111900	4115260	you want to you want to make sure that I'm comfortable I want to make sure you're

4403000	4406560	my my life is over and you're like what's going on he's like this jewel was
4406560	4411480	my whole job was to protect this jewel and it's gone oh boy you searched the
4411480	4414880	banditos and it turns out they might not have just been normal bandits or
4414880	4419640	banditos they might have been some sort of hired task force assassins who knows
4419640	4424920	what they had special arms and armor that seemed normal or better than bandito
4424920	4429240	armor they had a message with a secret message in another language they had
4429240	4436600	poison pills and a sack of silver pieces what else so yeah it was all crazy you
4436600	4440560	guys were trying to figure out what to do you were thinking about maybe chasing
4440560	4444760	them down you interrogated the banditos but you killed them in the process you
4444760	4447560	don't know what to do you were thinking about maybe going back to the home
4447560	4452840	office to research the secret message and turn in the mission the prior is
4452840	4458720	still gone though you nailed it no perfectly timed it almost not to
4458720	4463280	metagame but it almost sounds like we made a mistake not having the prior with
4463280	4467960	us why don't why don't we have the prior with he ran off in the melee I think yeah
4467960	4472960	yeah I think what happened he kind of is he was tied up and then I think the
4473200	4478240	started attacked and he was like untiming right and I did he just decal and then
4478240	4483720	Patches started complaining about his jewel and I like this is why my
4483720	4492000	character will will fail because he's too much like me I I got distracted by
4492000	4496240	Patches's need I wanted to make sure he was happy can I can I take some all
4496240	4499800	everyone's doing good can I take some of that stealthy leather armor is it too
4499800	4503160	big for me as a gnome right now it's too big you'd have you could put it on
4503160	4506440	but it wouldn't work as well and you could you could also get it fitted so if
4506440	4509800	you take it with you you can maybe get it fitted later all right does it so go
4509800	4518360	ahead does anybody have any kind of ability to to locate track of the prior
4518360	4525080	we made a big mistake he got away we should be going back to the headquarters
4525080	4533560	of the Church of the Silver Flame with him and as a guest okay well as you say
4533560	4539360	that you hear the the the beating of hoofbeats says as hoofs pound the ground
4539360	4543480	you see a black horse in the night it approaches and on the black horse
4543480	4549160	there's there's a darkened shadowy figure yeah he's wearing brown plate
4549160	4553080	mail you don't know what it's made out of but it seems kind of fancy and pretty
4553080	4560920	heavily worn and on the back on the behind the rider you can see tied up is
4560920	4564880	the prior on the back of the horse kind of over on his stomach he doesn't look
4564880	4569520	conscious you recognize this guy it's Geffen he's a veteran church militant
4569520	4574280	Inquisitor from the Eldine campaign the Eldine campaign was a campaign that the
4574280	4580040	church went on it was like a crusade to purge dryads from the forest so you you
4580040	4584080	Dan actually know Geffen a little bit from that it's not like you're great
4584080	4586860	buddies but he's someone you've seen around you might have fought side to
4586860	4589800	side with him or you know something like that you he's kind of like an old
4589800	4594280	person and I am Inquisitor or um Templar you're you're an Inquisitor yeah
4594280	4599160	you're you're a colleague he's a like higher ranking than me you don't
4599160	4602880	actually know his ranking um the the church certain parts of the church
4602880	4607200	hierarchy are kind of dubious and it's hard to tell the level inquisitors yeah
4607200	4610720	especially with inquisitors and you you're not close enough to know his
4610720	4614080	exact duty he just kind of shows up and leaves and stuff so you don't know what
4614080	4616760	he you don't know what he does and you're not close enough to him to ask
4616760	4620440	okay you're not close enough to him to have asked but I know his name yeah
4620440	4629720	Geffen Geffen oh what ho strangers oh no strangers are these
4630880	4635040	good old Geffen I found some vermin scuttling about in the night does this
4635040	4638800	look familiar out to you he tosses the prior down from the horse and he just
4638800	4643200	lands flat on his stomach and he was unconscious and he he kind of awakes
4643200	4649320	from the sudden impact he's all tied up it does indeed I you've you found a
4649320	4654680	source of our humiliation Geffen I we let this one escape and we weren't
4654680	4658480	supposed to thank you haha don't you don't want to tell me that because I'll
4658480	4662000	let you have them for the right price oh come on you already kicked him off your
4662000	4665960	horse I know it was an enticing offer wasn't it he's right there in front of
4665960	4671800	you well I first of all he's not exactly think we don't know that he's a bad guy
4671800	4678840	one silver piece come on man Geffen we work for the same company we're not
4678840	4683400	supposed to charge each other for doing the company's job yeah that's true
4683400	4687280	they're not supposed to serve two masters but yet you know coin in the
4687280	4692800	flame they're pretty pretty tempting you know I'm saying yeah I think the
4692800	4697920	question is what's more tempting to you the coin or the flame right now the coin
4697920	4705400	so you're not you're not really doing the flames bidding and like two silver
4705400	4710240	pieces which is fine you're you've presented yourself as a stranger to the
4710240	4714040	church you know so this isn't holy work so we'll approach it like you're a
4714040	4719120	traveling merchant I mean whatever you guys want man I'm just I'm just fucking
4719120	4723680	with you you could have them what I just thought I could get a couple gold you
4723680	4730360	fucking Jeff and you know you stranger oh yeah I'm Geffen well it's good to
4730360	4734200	find out this way that you got you and I are a little closer than I thought you
4734200	4738880	that we're fucking around level yeah yeah I show Geffen the secret message to
4738880	4746520	see if he can decipher it hmm I've seen this guild language it's the language
4746520	4750560	the guilds use yeah it's like shorthand it's it's kind of specialized for
4750560	4755200	business purposes like accounting and stuff like that transactional but it can
4755200	4759000	be used for other things too but you can't decipher it no it's just it's so
4759000	4763120	common because all the scribes use it it's a very common language we need this
4763120	4766680	prior we're gonna take them back to our church and you know kind of get back to
4766680	4772120	basics you want to come with or you want you could just kind of deus ex machina
4772120	4782240	yeah I just coming thanks for resetting our a-story I here's five silver pieces
4782240	4786000	because you're you seem like a good guy you're kind of like that guy in Game of
4786000	4790400	Thrones that the Uncle Bill or whatever that comes out with his uncle Benjen
4790400	4795680	he's got those fire maces whatever you can watch Game of Thrones what I watched
4795680	4799480	it at your house before I thought I love game I don't watch game with their
4799480	4803080	own I like it the most it's got magic who's uncle bill uncle he's talking about
4803080	4807560	Benjen it's like a half white walker like like oh yeah like only popped out
4807560	4815040	every now and then to save everybody's ass anyways I but what I have one
4815040	4818960	question about this yeah the guild we keep talking the guild like we're acting
4818960	4824800	like there's one guild guilds but but I'm sorry I'm okay I'm a little I
4824800	4827880	recognize the language but can't decipher it too but we're just to be
4827880	4832480	clear all guilds have languages all guilds have their own secret language
4832480	4837200	no no no it's just a it's a language that all the guilds use like a short
4837200	4841240	short-hand like I said like a shorthand secretarial kind of thieves guild uses
4841240	4845480	the same secret language as the anti thieves guild well all the guilds tend to
4845480	4848600	use the language they use other languages too but when they're writing
4848600	4853440	you know accounting or business related stuff they'll use this guild language so
4853440	4857120	it's sort of a language that specializes in accounting and and
4857120	4861440	diplomacy or whatever like a hierarchy yeah union shit you don't want to be
4861440	4866200	having dwarven script and then you have dwarven medals and trading them for elven
4866200	4869440	wares that are an elven script it's easier for everyone to just learn the
4869440	4874840	guild language I think I kind of get it and I'm excited about this world it's
4874840	4881720	like basic it's sort of like a really lateral way of organizing the normally
4881720	4887280	mishmash nature of language oh it's great there's a language called common
4887280	4890720	it's like it's like oh it's like a mark it's like markdown language it's like
4890720	4896360	saying like BU elf assassin thief plumber if you're in the business of
4896360	4903680	business let's let's do a CSS kind of coding language that that maximizes the
4903680	4908720	ability to transact right got it but I don't speak it no me neither I step in
4908720	4913680	and say hey a little less chipper jeffers and a little more adventuring
4913680	4917480	hey man I'm just marveling at this world man I know but sometimes there's shit
4917480	4927600	you know that guy in the the the the the the pooping is you know like shot 58
4927600	4930840	people with an automatic arrow and like we're all bummed out and I just like
4930840	4937680	that sometimes society does some it does function well okay all right well thanks
4937680	4944000	Geffen we're gonna we're gonna scamper off over to the way who is the prior
4944000	4951720	awake yeah we're should we ask him which way to go to the to the main town yeah
4951720	4955200	I'm kind of like a half place nowhere well the play okay the player is saying
4955200	4958600	I don't know where it is but the character knows where it is right okay
4958600	4965680	yeah yeah I mean we're we I take some rope out and rebind and the hands and
4966400	4971000	prior but just an aside like well we're I mean I'm just saying like we like as
4971000	4975800	far as I understand it like we don't we haven't categorized the prior in our
4975800	4980480	heads is like a bad guy no he's not like he's just a coward he may be an unwilling
4980480	4986720	companion on this on our journey he's not like he's not it's it's like we
4986720	4990840	have arrested him but he's not guilty of anything until a judge says so right
4990840	4994840	yeah that's how I'm looking yeah I mean I think he lift up the church circle we
4994840	4999000	only had to arrest him because he was threatening the safety of a kid you know
4999000	5002560	because he was like and it may be because he's one of the good guys yeah
5002560	5007760	but there was weird blood monster boogin magic going on in his basement at
5007760	5012440	his church that's under his purview but as the guy that's it's like if you run
5012440	5021000	into a guy you know after an attack he's the guy that's probably not involved
5021000	5024560	well we're gonna find out the church will have something to say about this
5024560	5031080	sure but let's not I just don't know I mean let's let's let let's let the
5031080	5034680	church sorted out right we're not gonna poison that well but the last time we do
5034680	5039760	have the poison pill he ran off and you can point he's a hostile witness yeah
5039760	5044900	yeah he has given us reason to mistrust his he's a flight risk to the church of
5044900	5052920	the silver to the church this is the song we sang every time we
5052920	5063440	I was trying to do it under
5082920	5099980	thank God I'm a country boy well I got me a hammer and I got me a sizzle I got
5099980	5106340	me a waffle and I got me a wiffle ain't got a life in lesson John Denver thank
5106440	5113480	God I'm a silver flame all right later in the in the evening passes or it takes
5113480	5118040	two days to travel in the second evening the only notable thing that happens is
5118040	5124240	on your on your path in the nighttime you're you you feel the quiet broken
5124240	5127840	just as if something strange has happened and you look out and you can
5127840	5133080	see over the night sky over the trees and canopies of the outlying area you
5133080	5138540	can see a large muscular brown demon like a classic demon like a muscular
5138540	5143300	humanoid with bat wings you know like a just a classic demon but he's got classic
5143300	5148340	demon yeah he's got giant giant orb like globe like glowing eyes and he's he's
5148340	5154180	carrying a lantern he's like carrying a hanging lantern and he's just hanging
5154180	5160960	out in the room as we're a demon what's up oh it's uh you you see you see him
5160960	5166120	like it's very far away and he's flying over like you might see a dragon flying
5166120	5170960	in the distance or something or like in modern times like a like a like a black
5170960	5179200	helicopter right it's like a little weird but yeah and you and diarrhea you
5179200	5184060	notice it like you feel like your heart stop like in your chest and like it
5184060	5187620	actually feels like for a sec you're having a heart attack as you see the
5187620	5192460	demon makes eye contact with you it like oh and then it just keeps flying on
5192460	5197660	and oh nothing else really happens it doesn't seem to really I think my I think
5197660	5202300	my heart just stopped how far away is he from us more than a mile but it's just
5202300	5205940	he's a big guy so you can kind of see it's also he's carrying a lantern is he
5205940	5211660	what is he flying over trees trees he's just doing his thing over the treetops
5211660	5218100	yeah carrying a lantern do what do we notice that he looked detected diarrhea
5218100	5222260	you saw him like look but you didn't see that he looked yeah I guess all of you
5222260	5225500	kind of think he looked at you but only Steve fell and then he said I feel like
5225500	5228500	I'm having a heart attack so we turn our attention to him and say what was going
5228500	5235580	on there but he that his eyes were piercing looking straight at me and then
5235580	5243020	my heart just stopped I think I did but weird bodily reaction to that preacher
5243020	5249900	looking at me from my understanding of Arcana believe that demon is a searcher
5249900	5256260	I may be making this up he's got a lantern and he's looking for stuff it's
5256260	5261900	interesting that he sensed diarrhea but that wasn't his objective you're right
5261900	5266260	that's a demon that's got a job and his job involves looking I said we go
5266260	5273220	investigate this shit oh that's a big demon and he's looking for something
5273220	5278220	there's there's three of us and a weird prior I think we can handle this shit
5278220	5286860	we're on our way do we know he's an unfriendly demon demons are unfriendly
5286860	5291380	if the friendliest demon is not someone you'd trust is this demon on the way to
5291380	5296140	where we're going we'll be going out of our way on our journey to the church to
5296140	5300460	go yeah it is but also it's like it's flying and you guys aren't flying and
5300460	5304500	it's miles away and it's flying fast so like it would be you kind of have to
5304500	5308580	triangulate and then you know it would be is it flying away from our destination
5308580	5311740	well yeah it's kind of going the other way like it's going so we'd have to
5311740	5317460	intercept his path somewhere fight far off our path yeah let's just clock it
5317460	5321660	like ho-oh in the pilot of Pokemon like it happened and we should continue on
5321660	5328500	our journey it's foreshadowing we I just want to I take the opportunity because
5328500	5333340	we're focused on travel because I just for my own edification I know the
5333340	5338460	character knows this stuff that is the player I just like we were in way in
5338460	5345780	this realm like we're in a continent called what we're in a realm called just
5345780	5351500	to Corvair you're in the country of Thrain and we were in Thrain and now so
5351500	5356180	Corvair is the continent Thrain is like the one of the kingdom yeah and and we
5356180	5360940	were and now we're and where is where we're headed back it's still in Thrain
5360940	5365460	Thrain most you're gonna stay in Thrain most of the campaign probably okay but
5365460	5369580	where is it and so it's a city that our headquarters are in yeah it's in the
5369580	5375020	it's in the the county of placeholder place right okay and it's a pure burn
5375020	5381700	abbey pure burn like pure burning propane or something that's like the
5381700	5385940	headquarters at least not maybe that globally but rats but it within Thrain
5385940	5389820	right well yeah the global headquarters is called flame keep but you guys are
5389820	5393820	kind of you know irregular so your headquarters in the flame keep your kind
5393820	5399540	in a satellite office right got it what I like using my like either local
5399540	5403900	knowledge or nature knowledge or whatever can we learn anything else
5403900	5409060	about that that demon flying local or what knowledge nature not with those
5409060	5413340	knowledges no I don't have anything with our it would be our candidate have to be
5413340	5419100	religion or planes yeah I say that Patchens is he awake how's he doing yeah
5419180	5425620	hey guys was I it was my voice hi hey guys Patchens we just saw a demon
5425620	5430820	seeking something that knew we were here but didn't even want to bother with this
5430820	5437500	is it possibly searching for this jewel of yours no but I don't know I don't I
5437500	5442580	don't think so it's fucking crazy if the demons here demons are like from a
5442580	5446420	different dimension yeah that Patchens voice was so high from no this is more
5446420	5452940	of a standard no voice gotta tell you my keyhole hurt a keel is hurting you
5452940	5456820	know I gotta tell you guys as a member of the the church metal tend to the
5456820	5463140	silver flame what we're gonna go back to the church to talk bureaucracy when we
5463140	5466900	could eliminate a demon from the world I mean isn't our job to go out there and
5466900	5471700	and destroy evil we're at a real crossroads I've gotten in enough trouble
5471700	5477580	for you know infractions of their stupid rules like I'd like to finish out
5477580	5481580	the job that we were assigned it like he's got a lantern and I gotta tell you
5481580	5485940	lanterns pissed me off because there's fire inside there but they're like it's
5485940	5492140	like keeping fire in a cage yeah it's a fire prison and I'm the fireliker I want
5492140	5495860	to go let that fire out and burn this demon up I want to get back to
5495860	5501460	placeholder okay you guys should fight should we have a vote oh we have a
5501780	5505620	we should fight amongst ourselves I mean not that wasn't a real pitch but yeah
5505620	5514380	that's what I said I fight what all right what do you guys I want to go I
5514380	5520740	want to go beat up this demon I okay I don't I mean so I'm just gonna get what
5520740	5523580	are we doing woods how are we gonna track that thing down just don't think
5523580	5529180	that's our job this world is filled with demons I have no doubt that that demon
5529180	5541180	is you know is related to to a larger okay I'm I'm metagaming I I yell to the
5541180	5548100	demon hey demon you're safe tonight not not you're in no danger from the church
5548100	5553140	of the silver flame I mean really we're a church full of weenies if we chase it
5553140	5559060	down I still think he would be in no danger well hey guys there's a million
5559060	5563660	demons we can go we can go hunt them down one by one and end up getting
5563660	5567140	killed because they're demons or we can do the job that we're supposed to be
5567140	5570420	doing don't you don't you want to go back home for just one night where we
5570420	5576620	could shower and just like bathe and we could just I mean in a bed and it'd be
5576620	5580740	so comfy and then maybe we can get like pancakes or something I'm a child of
5580740	5586300	nature I mean no my the woods in the wilderness is my it's my shit I know and
5586300	5591620	I I you I as a youth lived that life wandering from adventure to adventure
5591620	5594980	getting into any trouble that presented itself and there was no completion there
5594980	5598900	the church rescued me gave me structure the church isn't perfect but it gives
5598900	5603420	you a role in the universe which is to fight evil and if we depart from the
5603420	5609540	church's path and just go jumping into trouble then I may as well shed my silver
5609540	5615260	flame pendant and and and just become a regular-ass cleric wandering the fucking
5615260	5621700	world hunting treasure I'm just not that guy not yet you're not well I don't know
5621700	5625380	what the fuck that means but well how far away are we of Spencer from the
5625380	5630460	church like they're pretty no you know this is like you'll be there by morning
5630460	5635140	or you can see it from where you are okay let's go to the church let's play
5635140	5641180	it's safe I appreciate your you know I mean silver flame first it's like I got
5641180	5644140	a lot of complaints about how the church is run to this prior represents that
5644140	5648820	maybe yeah let's turn the prior in let's see what I say look we press on to the
5648820	5653420	church all right you get there you can see pureburn abbey as well as pureburn
5653420	5657260	keep you see pureburn keep is the barracks and it's the base of the church
5657260	5662020	militant that's stationed in placeholder pureburn keep works with pureburn abbey
5662020	5665740	to keep the peace but like the more churchy people go to the abbey and the
5665740	5670100	more military people go to the keep it keeps they work together to keep the
5670100	5676300	peace in placeholder and keep all of Corvair safe from evil you arrive at
5676300	5681660	pureburn keep it's your home office it's like a classic you know coming back to
5681660	5685660	the coming back to the office sort of situation you go through the front door
5685660	5689640	and into kind of the medieval office pool where all the Inquisitors and
5689640	5694280	militants hang out and they have desks you know there's there's people like
5694280	5698720	that it's it's not your home really because you're used to just getting shit
5698720	5703040	done this is more of like a paper pusher place than for soldiers and warriors and
5703040	5707120	clerics you know we have lockers and something yeah you're kind of going
5707120	5710440	through the office pool where all the tables are and people are like calling
5710440	5724880	you I was like oh it's spooky Carlos yeah keep keep shaming spirituality when
5724880	5730680	you work for a church why they call you spooky Carlos because I believe in weird
5730680	5735360	shit and so should you we work for a church yeah you you notice an old friend

5864660	5870500	your mission you're a report to the briefing room immediately well we're do
5870500	5873700	you want me to answer the first part or just follow the second part I don't know
5873700	5881500	maybe it was meant to be given out in two parts this line we'll see you in the
5881500	5888260	briefing room awesome that's brother Schrader brother Schrader these names
5888260	5893620	aren't super important but you know it'll be good keeping every note I like
5893620	5900740	it yeah all right well he disappears after doing that okay like magically no
5900740	5905780	no like his head was popped out of a door pops back all right so we got it
5905780	5909900	we got the brief it briefing room all right you enter the dark and you enter a
5909900	5914180	darkened room lit by narrow slit windows in the thick stone walls of the
5914180	5918400	keep Schrader takes a seat apart from you and seated nearby Schrader is a
5918400	5923180	bishop recognized open mobile recognizable by his uniform but
5923180	5927780	unrecognizable in his face or body or based on any of your memories okay
5927780	5938140	bishops are bishops are pretty big deals within the church ministry Patchens
5938140	5942260	also comes in with you and also yeah I mean up against the wall is Geffen he's
5942260	5952340	there it's a shady shady room hmm hey Geffen you got snacks no no what no all
5952340	5960620	right okay um I I approached the bishop and is it customary to like bow or
5960620	5966700	anything like a higher ranking hmm do we have like a thing I whatever nah nah
5966700	5972460	that's like not in this kind of thing what's our saying the flame will keep
5972460	5978940	the flame burns tall always keep that flame burning always keep that flame
5978940	5986220	burning chaos is a ladder that's I said this before but it's great chaos is a
5986220	5990500	ladder is a great response to condolences like I'm so sorry chaos is
5991500	6000300	I go up to the bishop and I nod and I say I as an indifference and I say may
6000300	6008540	the flame purify then may we be found worthy I walk up and say blessed be the
6008540	6019980	fruit for it will ferment is that how you say are there seats in here yeah
6020060	6024100	seats all right so I assume we're supposed to take a seat so I see I turn
6024100	6028700	the seat around and sit like the backward seat like a cocky way and we
6028700	6038620	have the prior with us and I I I now I I take a I untether him I'll say this is
6038620	6051540	prior to a name Abernathy this is prior Abernathy from Roan from Roan sir he we
6051540	6057980	believe he'll have more information than then we can give you we arrived at the
6057980	6065580	at the site of a quite a kerfuffle there was there was bad things happening to
6065580	6070660	to livestock they were doing blood magic rituals and making crazy blood
6070660	6076300	boogens and the whole thing blew up yeah we heard you blew up the church we
6076300	6079740	didn't blow up the church the bad guys blew up the church and we were lucky to
6079740	6088180	escape with our lives I think we blew it up didn't we no it was the creature lady
6088180	6093100	I assume that was an aside right yeah yeah just to be clear it's fine can you
6093100	6098580	remind me at table talk like what did we do all it up no but in theory you
6098580	6101700	could prevent it from being blown up right well we climbed up the ladder
6101700	6105140	because it was about to blow up like something got set off and we were like
6105140	6112100	okay yeah the P barrels it's true the the priority was lost
6112580	6120220	it was blood magic as my colleague is telling you taking place Abernathy here
6120220	6124740	claims to be ignorant of all of it I don't disbelieve him but I didn't want
6124740	6129660	to interrogate him without turning him into the the church that's that's our
6129660	6137300	full report Abernathy should hopefully have less trouble telling you the full
6137300	6140500	story we should probably also talk to petty cash about replacing a couple
6140500	6148260	doors for the fell family we we we kind of load a few things on fire all right I
6148260	6151580	want to put in a good word for Abernathy before anything begins and
6151580	6155020	that I think that he was the prior for my observation of an abbey that had gone
6155020	6158860	awry had been infiltrated by an evil force I believe he was dealing with it I
6158860	6163620	believe it pushed him over an edge so he was in danger of harming others that we
6163620	6167940	personally had exercised already we brought him here against his will
6167940	6172300	because his will was to run but I believe that's because he's aligned with
6172300	6177500	the church I just wanted to put in a good word for him sounds good I
6177700	6185340	appreciate your candor and your honesty and your what's what's just being a good
6185340	6191300	detective like what's that gum gum sure e yeah and your gum sure e so just rate
6191300	6194500	this one up for the logs you can collect your pay from Zellie in the
6194500	6200140	commissary sweet we'll take Patchens and abs and Abernathy and talk to him for a
6200140	6206580	bit we also Patchens you should tell Patchens is looking at you like he does
6206580	6211820	want you to say anything what we're not on salary we get paid per job you are
6211820	6215500	on salary and you get paid per job oh sweet Patchens doesn't want me to talk
6215500	6218380	about sidebar Patchen doesn't want me to talk about the fact that he lost an
6218380	6222940	important yeah he's looking at you like he'll die if it that comes out as a
6222940	6227460	pageant like he'll die like he'll be fired of life I finished my son if I go
6227460	6233220	Patchens I see the luck on your Patchens this guy he's the shit and then we walk
6233220	6238180	out yes sir I sorry Bishop I should have also commended this young man
6238180	6242660	Patchens he was a huge aid to us he didn't know who to trust but he trusted
6242660	6247940	us he helped us a great deal and he's been under a lot of duress and we were
6247940	6253260	we were assailed by bandits along the way back and he was hurt very badly I
6253260	6257100	hope that the church will take care of him make him comfortable and I'd also
6257100	6262220	like to know when he'll be released from debriefing so that I can buy him a beer
6262220	6267180	and give him my personal thanks it shouldn't take more than an hour all
6267180	6273740	right well Patchens thank you very much and we'll see you soon well we should
6273740	6281100	arrange to meet somewhere yeah like where that's a local tavern awesome is
6281100	6286020	that there's a name of a place that we what's our drawing room in in this in
6286020	6293420	placeholder oh wait the skull and bone there yet it's the play it looks like a
6293420	6297740	pirate flag but there's only one
6301100	6307340	all right well yeah that sounds good yeah all right let's go get paid at the
6307340	6315300	commissary let's collect that sweet placeholder money all right so this this
6315300	6321060	is the point where three weeks ago when I came up with this content I had an
6321060	6329820	audio video porch whoa we can I don't really we could cut the audio I can give
6329820	6335580	the audio to actually be cut in I could put the file online so that the audience
6335580	6340900	can see it but it's not gonna be perfectly viewable for us you know does
6340900	6344220	that make sense should we do as a cliffhanger and do it when we're back on
6344220	6348420	stage live or should we go out and fight that demon I don't I think we should
6348420	6352260	at least I don't know oh I guess we should probably stop soon huh but yeah
6352260	6361980	we should at least I want to play cuz it's been three weeks I don't know we
6361980	6371780	can put a poor Spencer trying to follow my dream of having an AV podcast church
6371780	6375300	can you just wear a fire marshal outfit and come in here and shut the whole
6375300	6381060	thing down this would be a great time to subscribe to bark box bark box and me
6381060	6387020	undies it's like a box full of dog stuff sent to your home on a subscription

6411500	6416220	hot summer day wait a second there's a new underwear in town it's called me

6447980	6456620	detective dick diamond I've solved the case of chafed balls we get it's gonna be
6456620	6460580	the most underwhelming we should just not do it no I want to support you I know
6460580	6464660	but it's just now it's the most it's gonna come on everyone's on your side no
6464660	6469060	no and no and I hate you if we just a boy I said I said we should have gone
6469060	6471940	out and fought that demon we could have averted this whole thing I want it this
6471940	6478140	isn't a we've had a great beer platform for your agenda let's get behind
6478140	6483500	Spencer I'm excited about this well yeah I mean he's saying don't be you
6483500	6487980	support him by not being excited he's gonna Twitter it I'll put our reddit to
6487980	6491540	the harmontown Instagram maybe we can I'll put it there too it'll be it'll be
6491540	6495980	on the harmontown Instagram yeah all right I hate myself now come on dude
6495980	6499980	you're I mean I want to support you now more than ever like you this is you were
6499980	6504340	like man let me get behind this fucking podcast like I want you to be rewarded
6504340	6508980	yeah well this is my reward this is gonna be your shining moment here we go
6508980	6512980	all right first of all you became president of the United States today
6512980	6515980	mission complete
6534820	6541100	we got a final grade of a d-plus yeah see those listening it's like this it's
6541100	6545540	basically he made like the video game equivalent of like when a dungeon master
6545540	6550020	like tells you your campaign your or not your campaign your mission is his over
6550020	6553540	and like he's here's your here's your experience points and things but we got
6553540	6559180	graded we saved four people we got a d-plus overall the game we got was for
6559180	6564860	time right because it happened really I guess that assumes we rushed I mean
6564860	6569340	that was a good thing but so we probably should have been a little more
6570180	6573580	maybe that's good to know well that's the thing is that like you know you play
6573580	6576660	these video games and then you're like I did okay then you get the score it's
6576660	6580580	like wait wait here's what we're measuring right how many gold pieces do
6580580	6585140	we get no that was collateral you cost five hundred gold
6585140	6589900	that's part of what mayor's gonna have all right yeah that's amazing all right
6589900	6595340	so that makes me want to keep playing more so I see more well that's I mean I
6595340	6598660	think that was Spencer's right successful goal was that he's like why
6598660	6602780	don't we make this give you the dopamine spike of a mission that's
6602780	6607020	finished well or not okay and then you're like God okay so now you get a
6607020	6609780	kind of a fresh start of the next one that would have been a smash hit with an
6609780	6616980	audience I know it was a great idea I have good ideas it's almost like we
6616980	6621180	should have had permits for our new venue yeah no it's cool I should if I
6621180	6623980	didn't bitch out that one time when we were gonna play D&D it would have
6623980	6627500	happened probably huh now are we gonna get a new a new adventure now we're
6627500	6630460	gonna talk about a new mission here embarking on a new that's why I'm so
6630460	6633220	exciting now we know the characters and now we're like in placeholder and then
6633220	6636580	we like I'm going to the tavern and I'm gonna have a drink and then we have so
6636580	6641060	many storylines to invest so we can all turn to each other and say okay D plus
6641060	6647900	not our best word lots of mistakes were made but we kind of know who we are now
6647900	6654180	we kind of know how to use our spells a little bit we we worked as a team we
6654180	6658060	failed kind of as a team but a D plus is better than an F but I want to get
6658060	6661460	better and I can now because I can take notes I want to I want to learn to use
6661460	6664940	note-taking software the best way possible so that like when we meet a
6664940	6669580	character I can like hashtag it yeah so that it's like I'll have a list of all
6669580	6674660	the characters and you know like I'm gonna fucking nail this okay so now that
6674660	6679020	was dismissed who's our who's our main man who's who's Charlie to our angels
6679020	6683740	that's gonna give us our new thing how about brother Absalom brother Absalom
6683740	6690060	yeah brother Absalom are we still going well anyways no but I said I do want to
6690060	6693660	I do want to partake of the irony here though that you know like I've been this
6693660	6697780	Howard Hughes obsession person about the new venue and how we're gonna show
6697780	6703620	video and audio and stuff and Spencer's what it's like a fucking really funny
6703620	6709220	irony there that Spencer secretly was like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna
6709220	6713700	blow their socks yeah I do what Dan's keeps babbling about and like do the
6713700	6717060	audio visual thing at the end of a Dungeons and Dragons I'm gonna back them
6717060	6720540	up and do this and then it's like the fire marshall comes in and I spent 90
6720540	6723940	minutes talking about how thrilled I was
6723940	6732740	it's fun well this would have been better if we I think it's really
6732740	6739660	beautiful I know it's like sitcom it's hard to park the wreck level I love but
6739660	6744500	yeah thank you well it sounds like we're teed up for next time for a new mission
6744500	6748700	right I feel it's pretty safe to say the next time next Harman town episode is
6748700	6753400	going to be in this format we're not gonna just like leap into some
6753400	6759360	willy-nilly live venue I'd rather refine this experience while we wait for
