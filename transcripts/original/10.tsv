0	7000	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, geniuses of Harman Town.
7000	20000	Please, let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
20000	26000	Thank you, thank you.
26000	29000	I already screwed up the music.
29000	33000	Alright, it's cool, just take it easy.
33000	44000	Alright, please welcome back guest comptroller Erin McGathey.
44000	46000	See, they like you, they're okay with you.
46000	48000	Alright, thanks guys. I feel okay.
48000	55000	Full disclosure, I had two drinks before the show and I feel too drunk for two drinks, but I'm fine.
55000	60000	That's unacceptable here. We've explained it before, we were on a tight ship.
60000	66000	Just don't let it get us off on too many tangents because we don't like to do that.
66000	67000	We like to focus.
67000	71000	What are your guys' favorite drinks?
71000	81000	The theme of tonight is, I guess we decided in the car because I was trying to explain Knight Rider to Erin.
81000	90000	So I thought, maybe if we made the theme of the 80s, we'll just get some stuff from you guys about the 80s and I'll try to find out what she knows about them.
90000	97000	I was trying to explain Knight Rider to her and I realized, it sounds like a pretty sloppy show.
97000	107000	Well, he was a cop that, I think he got targeted by the mob, so he got killed, but they erased him and changed his face and gave him a new name.
107000	110000	Well, why'd they do that? Well, I don't know.
110000	116000	Okay, so instead of putting him in the witness production program, they're like, I think you could also just keep on being a cop.
116000	119000	Yeah, well, he wanted to fight more crime.
119000	121000	Wasn't the car talk? The car has a spirit in it, right?
121000	128000	It doesn't have a spirit in it. It's just a very sophisticated automobile.
128000	134000	This was a time in pop culture when computers were very exciting to people and magical.
134000	137000	It was enough that it was a computer. That's what made it talk.
137000	138000	But it had a personality.
138000	141000	Yeah, that of William Daniels from St. Elsewhere.
141000	143000	Yeah. Aaron, let me ask you something.
143000	144000	Okay.
144000	149000	What do you know about Alf?
149000	152000	I saw some episodes of Alf as a child.
152000	154000	I didn't.
154000	166000	I remember that he was a, he was kind of like a sexual puppet and he couldn't tell that guy what to do.
166000	169000	He had a lot of advice. He also always stayed on a couch.
169000	172000	He never got up from the couch, but sometimes he got up from the couch.
172000	174000	Stayed behind the couch, probably.
174000	175000	He's a puppet, right?
175000	177000	But a lot of times he was on the couch, right?
177000	179000	I'm just telling you about my memory.
179000	181000	You saw it more than me. I never watched that.
181000	189000	Right, but he was an alien and a family took him in and they, boy, did they learn a lot about who they were.
189000	192000	Were there people trying to catch him? Was there ever a danger?
192000	196000	Because I used to watch My Favorite Martian and Morgan Mindy and there was always a...
196000	198000	Who is your favorite Martian?
198000	200000	Just kidding. Sorry.
200000	203000	Ray Walston.
203000	204000	I don't remember.
204000	210000	There's usually like an FBI guy or somebody who were a cop or somebody that, boy, oh, boy, if we find out, oh, God.
210000	212000	Because in addition to being younger than you...
212000	217000	I'm sorry, stop everything. Adam Goldberg is getting fidgety.
217000	220000	I just saw him in the audience. He's raising his hand.
220000	224000	No, that's normal. Stop the show when he's seizureing.
224000	228000	Adam, I have a pad of paper. Whenever you have an idea, write it on the paper.
228000	230000	We'll talk about it.
230000	233000	The elf was constantly menaced by the government.
233000	234000	Okay.
234000	237000	So I did have a cliffhanger where they caught him and they never made part two.
237000	238000	Oh.
238000	240000	He fucking wanted to eat a cat.
240000	243000	Right, right. Cats. He like cats. Yes.
243000	244000	All right.
244000	247000	I'm sorry I've asked for your...
247000	248000	All right.
248000	249000	Let's hear it for Adam.
249000	252000	Here's everything that Adam just said.
252000	258000	According to Adam, elf was wanted by the government and wanted to eat cats.
258000	267000	Then he said, I'm sorry I have ass-burgers, which he insists on pronouncing that way because he has ass-burgers.
267000	268000	It's like a tick.
268000	271000	I just wanted to say I feel like this is important.
271000	277000	I am 12 years younger than you, but I also, because I'm a navy kid, when I was a kid,
277000	282000	the television, was anyone else a child in the navy and group on navy bases?
282000	283000	Thank you.
283000	285000	So we watched a channel called AFRTS.
285000	288000	So you watched like a weird selection of shows.
288000	293000	So I may have seen elf, but I saw like three episodes of elf.
293000	294000	I'm sorry.
294000	297000	Because the soldiers aren't allowed to watch current things.
297000	299000	No, because there was just...
299000	302000	They might incite them to be non-soldieric.
302000	306000	They're like, wait a minute, who is the boss?
307000	309000	Kill the general.
311000	313000	That car is talking.
313000	315000	I mean, I can talk.
315000	317000	I can talk my way out of this war.
317000	319000	Who am I fighting?
320000	321000	I'm disappearing.
321000	322000	It came a lot.
322000	325000	They do the same thing with the juries, because they have to sequester them,
325000	328000	and they do the same thing in all of China.
328000	335000	You have to keep people from looking at Bloomingdale's catalogs if you want to fight...
335000	337000	A way of life.
338000	341000	Elf, we have to talk.
341000	344000	That's my impression of elf's dad.
345000	346000	Max Wright.
346000	353000	Elf, are you trying to get chased by the government and eat cats?
355000	359000	I want to get serious tonight, because it's obviously a quiet,
359000	362000	either intimidated or bored crowd.
362000	363000	I'm not blaming you guys.
363000	364000	That's not what I meant.
364000	366000	Please don't ever let me slip into that.
366000	368000	I will never abuse you just because I'm doing a shitty show.
368000	369000	No.
369000	371000	Dan, I don't think they're doing anything wrong.
371000	372000	No, they're not.
372000	373000	I think it's me.
373000	374000	I'm being nervous.
374000	375000	All right, well, let her good cop it.
375000	376000	I'm not good copping it.
376000	378000	I'm saying you can blame me.
378000	379000	Oh, no.
379000	380000	I wouldn't do that either.
380000	382000	You were talking about anxiety.
382000	384000	It's fine to have a quiet night in Herman Town.
384000	385000	It's okay.
385000	386000	You don't have to be uproarious.
386000	390000	There's absolutely nothing funny happening or entertaining.
390000	393000	There's no one coming at me with a knife.
393000	401000	Your heart rate can be down here by sleeping.
401000	406000	You can be relaxed, like a person in a commercial for a bed.
406000	410000	It's fine, because ultimately there is no sponsor,
410000	414000	and there is nothing at stake, except your $10,
414000	417000	which is now gone.
417000	420000	But I will give you $10 worth of an experience.
420000	425000	If I have to slash my wrists up here, you won't react to it.
425000	428000	You'll cringe, and it'll make you sad.
428000	431000	Tonight we are sponsored by humanity.
431000	432000	That's correct.
432000	433000	Thank you, baby.
433000	435000	So we're talking about anxiety.
435000	439000	I want to talk about my newly found mental disorder,
439000	441000	the fact that I'm losing my fucking mind,
441000	443000	the fact that I'm falling apart.
443000	447000	I started doing this diet where you eat.
447000	450000	It's the four-hour body diet, and hold for applause.
450000	451000	Okay.
451000	456000	I didn't mean it.
456000	459000	The four-hour body diet in a nutshell.
459000	460000	I didn't read the book.
460000	461000	Erin did.
461000	463000	She imparted it to me.
463000	466000	You eat beans, meat, and veggies for six days a week,
466000	469000	and then every cheap day, Saturday in our case.
469000	475000	You eat 18,000 cupcakes, 20 pretzels, a cars, fire hydrants,
475000	478000	whatever you want, because you're spiking your blood sugar
478000	480000	and then you're doing all this stuff.
480000	482000	I'm certainly not doing the diet right by supplementing it
482000	486000	with quarts of vodka.
486000	488000	There's all kinds of variables there.
488000	491000	Started doing the diet, lost a bunch of weight.
491000	496000	Then for you avid podcasties, you know that there was a point
496000	499000	where I called an ambulance because I got so lightheaded,
499000	501000	I had no idea what was going on.
501000	504000	I had a sensation that I had never experienced before,
504000	506000	which was just vague lightheadedness.
506000	508000	I didn't faint, and there was no pain,
508000	511000	and my heart wasn't going fast.
511000	513000	There was nothing other than it was just cloudy,
513000	516000	but it was so persistent and so odd.
516000	518000	I never experienced it before, so I was certain,
518000	520000	well, this means I'm dying.
520000	525000	I gave it 45 minutes to an hour to go away thinking,
525000	528000	well, drinking water, maybe it's a thing,
528000	532000	ate a bowl of beans, maybe it's blood sugar because of this diet.
532000	533000	It just keeps going.
533000	534000	I'll lay down.
534000	536000	I don't want to lay down because that's what dead people do.
536000	538000	I lay down, and then I get up.
538000	539000	Now I'm even more lightheaded.
539000	540000	Okay, call an ambulance.
540000	542000	Ambulance comes over full of all these Jake Gyllenhaals,
542000	545000	and they said, you're in fine condition.
545000	547000	I went to the doctor.
547000	548000	The doctor took my blood.
548000	549000	Blood came back.
549000	552000	He said, again, as I talked about on the podcast,
552000	553000	cholesterol is perfect.
553000	554000	Liver is perfect.
554000	555000	Kidneys are perfect.
555000	559000	Blood sugar is very, very low, but not in a bad way.
560000	562000	Your triglycerides are high, but not in a bad way.
562000	564000	It's just a sign of you being on this diet.
564000	565000	I'm like, okay.
565000	568000	So that didn't show anything.
568000	570000	They keep having these lightheaded spells,
570000	572000	and I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
572000	574000	And Aaron keeps going.
574000	576000	It's probably anxiety, probably.
576000	577000	I'm like, that's retarded.
577000	578000	Stop it.
578000	582000	I'm sorry for the retarded people that just heard me say that.
582000	584000	Like my sister.
584000	586000	My sister's retarded.
586000	588000	I get one every podcast.
589000	592000	Because of her and the sacrifices I made growing up with her.
595000	600000	The next thing I call retarded will be valuable and capable.
605000	607000	So I slowly come to the...
607000	611000	Then I had this breakthrough during this beach trip with my friends.
611000	612000	I'm like, God.
612000	614000	Somebody said, well, maybe it's a vitamin D deficiency.
614000	615000	I'm like, God damn it.
615000	616000	That's it.
616000	618000	They said I had a vitamin D deficiency.
618000	621000	So I go out in the sun, and I'm like, I'm like Birdman.
621000	622000	I get power.
622000	623000	That's what it is.
623000	624000	Of course, I never go out.
624000	625000	I figured it out.
625000	626000	I figured it out.
626000	627000	And then a half hour later, I'm like, ugh.
627000	628000	And then I have a root beer.
628000	629000	And I go, no, it's blood sugar.
629000	631000	Because now I feel great.
631000	633000	I take some potassium.
633000	635000	I eat a banana, and I go like, no, it's potassium.
635000	636000	It's potassium.
636000	639000	And every time I get on the internet,
639000	641000	and I Google whatever it is I'm doing,
641000	643000	and I go, potassium deficiency.
643000	645000	And it pulls up the symptoms, and I search for lightheadedness,
645000	646000	and I go, OK, there it is.
646000	647000	I clinched it.
647000	648000	I got it.
648000	650000	And I'm doing all these experiments on myself,
650000	651000	trying to figure this out.
651000	654000	And basically, all the experiments
654000	657000	result in just further and further panic.
657000	661000	Like, I just keep, like, these things don't go away.
661000	662000	So we went to San Diego.
662000	663000	I went to the San Diego Zoo.
663000	664000	I'm walking around.
664000	665000	She's in heaven.
665000	666000	She's always wanted to go there.
666000	667000	It's a bunch of fucking animals.
667000	669000	I love it, too.
669000	673000	But I'm preoccupied by, I just keep having these spells.
673000	674000	I'm like, there it is again.
674000	675000	OK, I'll drink a Sprite.
675000	676000	I think it's blood sugar.
676000	677000	I'm back around to that.
677000	678000	No.
678000	679000	And now I feel better.
679000	680000	OK, I've noticed.
680000	681000	Half hour after I drink a Sprite,
681000	683000	my head clears up perfectly.
683000	685000	But then that starts not being the case.
685000	687000	Then that science goes out the window.
687000	690000	Now, no matter what I do, maybe I drank too much Sprite.
690000	692000	Maybe I'm hyperglycemic.
692000	694000	I don't know what's happening.
694000	695000	And Erin, who's been saying for weeks,
695000	697000	like, it's probably anxiety.
697000	698000	We're standing in line.
698000	700000	She goes, like, let's go on the bucket
700000	702000	that takes you over the whole San Diego Zoo
702000	704000	and dangles you from 5,000 feet.
704000	706000	That'll relax you.
706000	707000	And I'm standing in line.
707000	710000	And it's like, this is probably not a good idea.
710000	712000	But I don't want to be a pussy because, God knows,
712000	718000	I've done nothing but show her what a man I am so far.
718000	723000	I want to find out now that I am a complete pussy.
723000	725000	So I'm just kind of standing there going,
725000	726000	this is not a good idea.
726000	728000	I'm going to be in a bucket dangling over people.
728000	731000	And we get to the front of the line.
731000	733000	And I'm just still talking about it.
733000	734000	I just don't get it.
734000	735000	It's not the Sprite.
735000	736000	It's not the bananas.
736000	737000	It's not the pretzels.
737000	738000	It's not the fire hydrants.
738000	739000	It's not the giraffes.
739000	741000	What the fuck is wrong with me?
741000	742000	What's happening to me?
742000	744000	And earlier that day, I'd been in tears.
744000	745000	There's something wrong with you.
745000	747000	And you don't know what it is.
747000	749000	I'm spoiled rotten.
749000	752000	20% of you in the audience have diabetes.
752000	754000	Some of you have MS.
754000	758000	There's a guy here that's an aneurysm survivor.
758000	760000	He came here tonight in spite of his symptoms.
760000	763000	He's like, the doctors are giving him horrible news.
763000	766000	And he's, I'm just going like, oh, why am I lightheaded?
766000	768000	My life, I can't do it.
768000	771000	Like crying in hotel rooms and then going to the zoo
771000	772000	and going, I think we need to go home.
772000	775000	We're standing in front of the line at the bucket.
775000	779000	And Aaron goes, Dan, Dan, you've eliminated
779000	780000	every possibility.
780000	783000	Sooner or later, you have to accept the fact
783000	785000	that you're going to be fine.
785000	786000	It's anxiety.
786000	787000	No, it's not.
787000	788000	No, it's not.
788000	789000	It's not anxiety.
789000	790000	I have anxiety.
790000	791000	I'm at a zoo.
791000	793000	Everything is going fine for me.
793000	797000	No, you've spent the last six months to a year
797000	801000	going through enormous changes that no one,
801000	804000	you're the only one that hasn't acknowledged.
804000	806000	You're the only one that hasn't accepted
806000	809000	or acknowledged or expressed or felt any of it.
809000	812000	You've acted completely normal while your entire life
812000	814000	has completely changed.
814000	817000	And it doesn't matter if you're at a zoo or eating spaghetti
817000	820000	or a Sprite or dancing or drinking or drinking water
820000	821000	or not drinking water.
821000	824000	They're coming and going at random intervals.
824000	826000	You're having panic attacks.
826000	829000	And the way that they go away is when you accept
829000	832000	the fact that you're going to be fine.
832000	835000	And I was just thinking in my head,
835000	837000	this fucking bitch keeps going on.
837000	840000	This is just making me panic.
840000	843000	And I had experimented in the past
843000	845000	looking in the mirror and going, you're fine.
845000	847000	That's stressful.
847000	850000	That's what Norman Bates does.
850000	851000	You're fine.
851000	852000	You're fine.
852000	854000	You're a winner.
854000	857000	You're going to get out there and take the world by storm.
857000	859000	Get out there, Norman.
859000	863000	But because I was in a line for a bucket that goes over a thing
863000	866000	and I had to just internalize it really
866000	869000	for the first time I said it in my head, okay,
869000	870000	I'm going to be fucking fine.
870000	872000	There is nothing left to do.
872000	873000	Either I'm going to die.
873000	876000	Either I have a tumor or I'm a ghost.
876000	879000	Or I'm a Twilight Zone episode.
879000	881000	Somebody erased me in the past.
881000	885000	Or it's a new form of pretzel I haven't narrowed down.
885000	888000	I can do nothing about it.
888000	891000	I'm probably going to be fine.
891000	894000	And then it vanished.
894000	895000	My head completely cleared up.
895000	898000	I got completely normal, like I am now.
898000	900000	And then we got in the bucket and dangled over the zoo
900000	901000	and I was fine.
901000	902000	I was even more relaxed.
902000	904000	I was like, whee, it was a bucket over the zoo.
904000	907000	And I started crying because my girlfriend cured me
907000	911000	of my insanity and saved me from what I thought was something
911000	912000	that was killing me.
912000	918000	And it wasn't a funny story, but it made me like you more.
918000	919000	Ugh.
919000	925000	I hate inflating her head.
925000	926000	But maybe that has something to do with it.
926000	928000	Maybe I'm in a relationship where I'm like,
928000	929000	this is it.
929000	930000	I don't know.
930000	931000	Maybe that's it.
931000	933000	Maybe it's writing a CBS sitcom.
933000	936000	Wait, did you just say that I'm causing your anxiety?
936000	937000	No, no.
937000	939000	The idea that you're...
939000	942000	Let me put this in terms that you'll accept.
942000	950000	Maybe you're so awesome that I'm having anxiety attacks.
950000	952000	I'm not trying to stress you out.
952000	953000	I'm just trying to understand.
953000	954000	I would like to, as an experiment,
954000	956000	try to cause an anxiety attack.
956000	957000	Because here's the other thing.
957000	960000	Then I was fine.
960000	961000	And then it was fine.
961000	962000	I was like, oh, shit.
962000	963000	We cured it.
963000	964000	We cured it.
964000	966000	And then, like, today I was in this writer's room.
966000	968000	And then I started having one.
968000	971000	And this time I was like, I just noted on my stopwatch, like,
971000	972000	okay, let's see how long these things last.
972000	973000	What's going on?
973000	975000	It lasted a half hour.
975000	978000	And then it was gone.
978000	981000	And then right before the show, I went out with you.
981000	984000	We went across the street to Pikey.
984000	987000	And I had one for, like, an hour, like, a general unease.
987000	991000	They have different classes, like the ghosts and ghostbusters.
991000	995000	Like, there's the kind that are so small, like, waves,
995000	996000	that I can...
996000	998000	They're so small that I can just jump over them.
998000	999000	I can feel them coming in.
999000	1001000	And then I just go, they're not happening.
1001000	1002000	And then they go away.
1002000	1007000	And then there's ones that are so big that me saying they're not
1007000	1010000	happening and them not going away makes them bigger.
1010000	1013000	And those are basically the two categories.
1013000	1017000	And then they last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and a half.
1017000	1018000	Right.
1018000	1021000	And so now I'm, like...
1021000	1024000	And then we have this argument about, well, I shouldn't be cataloging them.
1024000	1028000	I'm going to the doctor tomorrow because I probably have a fucking meatball
1028000	1029000	in my brain or something.
1029000	1030000	No.
1030000	1031000	There's, like, a baby skull.
1031000	1036000	Like, I have an absorbed twin that's, like, trying to get out of my brain.
1036000	1038000	And it just keeps moving every once in a while.
1038000	1039000	Like, it kicks.
1039000	1041000	And then I have a spell.
1041000	1042000	And then it stops kicking.
1042000	1045000	And then I go, oh, the sprite worked.
1045000	1046000	I don't fucking know.
1046000	1047000	I've tried not drinking.
1047000	1048000	I've tried...
1048000	1051000	You would have such mixed emotions if you found out that you had a really
1051000	1053000	special tumor.
1053000	1055000	I know.
1055000	1058000	Well, I'm pretty psyched about having anxiety disorder, like, on the level
1058000	1059000	of Tony Soprano.
1059000	1062000	Like, I'm like, I am an interesting guy.
1062000	1063000	I'm kind of into it.
1063000	1065000	I'm like, oh, do I get to be, like, Linus?
1065000	1068000	Do I get a blanket?
1068000	1071000	I think that makes me pretty interesting.
1072000	1074000	Maybe you add a little side order Asperger's.
1074000	1076000	I don't know.
1076000	1077000	You want it so bad.
1077000	1078000	Oh, and glasses.
1078000	1081000	Why is my vision 2020?
1081000	1083000	I want sexy glasses.
1083000	1084000	Well, like I said earlier...
1084000	1087000	And why is it too hot to wear a cool leather jacket?
1087000	1090000	Like, Neil Gaiman.
1090000	1091000	No way.
1091000	1093000	He just dresses like Ford Prefect all day.
1093000	1096000	So lucky to be from London.
1096000	1099000	When we went into the Hugo Awards, because Neil Gaiman was nominated in the
1100000	1102000	same category when we walked in, I said...
1102000	1103000	And you know why?
1103000	1105000	Because he grew up with the name Gaiman.
1105000	1107000	That's why he won.
1107000	1111000	You're not going to beat a guy in a sci-fi contest who grew up with the name
1111000	1113000	Gaiman on the playground.
1113000	1114000	Erin, would you...
1114000	1115000	Yeah, I know.
1115000	1116000	I know I'm not winning.
1116000	1117000	Well, Jesus.
1117000	1118000	I was going to ask...
1118000	1120000	I was going to pull another thing.
1120000	1121000	Oh, yeah.
1121000	1123000	Please.
1123000	1124000	I'm sorry.
1124000	1126000	It's like milking a cobra.
1126000	1128000	If I just go, Erin...
1128000	1130000	I raped your brother.
1130000	1132000	I didn't know.
1132000	1134000	It's like a tuning fork.
1134000	1135000	That's so weird.
1135000	1136000	I'm sorry.
1136000	1138000	I don't know why I'm feeling so anxious.
1138000	1139000	I apologize.
1139000	1140000	Do what I do.
1140000	1141000	Blame the audience.
1141000	1143000	They're mellow tonight.
1143000	1147000	The audience's job is to sit and absorb.
1147000	1152000	Their mood is a nuanced, organic thing that no one can predict or control.
1152000	1155000	They're like a gelatinous mass made of little people-shaped particles.
1155000	1158000	They're just like Play-Doh or goo.
1158000	1167000	The only thing that they respond to is total balance between acknowledging them and ignoring them.
1167000	1172000	A guy who spins plates has to spin his plates.
1172000	1177000	If he pretended that the audience wasn't there, he'd be a shitty plate spinner.
1177000	1181000	But also if he kept asking them which plate to spin, all the plates would crash to the floor.
1182000	1184000	They sit there like this ooze.
1184000	1187000	The performer wades into the ooze.
1187000	1189000	The air conditioning.
1189000	1194000	Whatever's happening on the evening news and whatever collection of sandwiches they've eaten,
1194000	1197000	they all add up to some random number.
1197000	1198000	We just accept it.
1198000	1201000	Guys, I just want to ooze with you.
1201000	1203000	Just ooze together.
1203000	1207000	Sometimes the ooze is dark and heavy, like gravy.
1207000	1209000	Want to take a nap after Thanksgiving?
1209000	1212000	Just hang out, watch a football game.
1212000	1219000	This isn't me blaming you, but I think all of our talk about anxiety made me feel very anxious.
1219000	1221000	Yeah, that's what you always say.
1221000	1222000	I don't know what to do with that.
1222000	1223000	That makes me more anxious.
1223000	1225000	No, no, don't feel anxious.
1225000	1226000	Don't feel anxious.
1226000	1227000	Let's forget it.
1227000	1229000	Hey!
1229000	1231000	Forget that I'm having anxiety attacks.
1231000	1234000	Forget that me talking about them gives Aaron anxiety attacks.
1234000	1238000	Everyone, please forget that you affect us.
1238000	1241000	Forget you're watching a show.
1241000	1249000	Get up, and in an orderly fashion, go to your cars and forget that you came here.
1249000	1251000	I need to say really quick about anxiety attacks.
1251000	1255000	That just because you identified it doesn't mean that it's going to end.
1255000	1256000	It's good.
1256000	1259000	It also doesn't mean that I don't have cancer.
1259000	1261000	The symptoms could still be the same.
1261000	1264000	I'm going to go back into the doctor and I'll go, seriously,
1264000	1267000	you can't just take some blood out of a guy's arm and tell him he's fine.
1267000	1269000	Something's happening to me.
1269000	1271000	I don't want to think that you have cancer.
1271000	1272000	No, you're not dying.
1272000	1274000	Aaron, I'm dying.
1274000	1277000	You are in love with a dying man.
1277000	1283000	It's just like how I love my mom before she died of cancer.
1283000	1286000	Maybe I want that kind of love.
1286000	1289000	Maybe I'm sick of hearing about this woman.
1289000	1292000	I gave you so much.
1292000	1298000	Why don't you marry her or let go of her and marry me?
1298000	1302000	You were going to go to the bucket?
1302000	1303000	I don't know.
1303000	1305000	Hey, Max Headroom, what do you think?
1305000	1306000	Oh, boy.
1306000	1310000	We went to my 10-year high school reunion this last weekend,
1310000	1313000	and Dan was a hit.
1313000	1314000	He started the whole...
1314000	1316000	He started everyone dancing.
1316000	1318000	He just decided that he would start dancing.
1318000	1321000	The band geeks from my class came up to me
1321000	1324000	and were telling me that they all knew who Dan was
1324000	1328000	and they were telling me how cool it was, all the band geeks.
1328000	1330000	He could have predicted that.
1330000	1331000	Well, that was his reaction.
1331000	1332000	I thought it was really cool.
1332000	1334000	I was like, damn, they know who you are.
1334000	1335000	I was like, yeah, pretty much.
1335000	1338000	And I know who they are.
1338000	1343000	Their names are Bread and Butter.
1343000	1347000	And I have known them for my entire 20-year career.
1347000	1349000	And I am peaking right now.
1349000	1352000	I knew that your high school class would have like five guys in it
1352000	1356000	who played tuba or track team too.
1356000	1360000	I knew there'd be a couple guys who would slip up to me at the urinal
1360000	1363000	and go, hey, man, good job.
1363000	1365000	I'd go like, hey, thank you.
1365000	1368000	Good job going to high school with my girlfriend.
1368000	1370000	You had guys slip up to you at the urinal?
1370000	1376000	No.
1376000	1379000	And I spent like an hour there.
1379000	1385000	Because of my prostate and my desperation.
1385000	1389000	I tried to take Aaron through all of the Friday the 13th movies.
1389000	1392000	What I like about trying to explain 80s things to Aaron
1392000	1396000	is for the first time in my life having to explain them
1396000	1399000	and realizing how dumb they are and how confusing.
1399000	1403000	I was trying to go from Friday the 13th part one
1403000	1407000	all the way to the end even though they stopped numbering them
1407000	1409000	and started rebooting and all this stuff.
1409000	1411000	And it got very convoluted.
1411000	1413000	Same with Knight Rider.
1413000	1415000	Same with Phil Collins.
1415000	1421000	My whole life just becomes rubble in the eyes of my 27-year-old girlfriend.
1421000	1424000	No.
1424000	1427000	Wow, you like dumb shit too.
1427000	1431000	I don't care about no neutral milk hotel.
1432000	1434000	Why is there a hotel neutral?
1434000	1436000	Answer that.
1436000	1438000	Stupid.
1438000	1441000	Can we talk about the fact that you don't know how Smurfs talk,
1441000	1443000	which I found out?
1443000	1444000	I know how Smurfs talk.
1444000	1446000	I called Aaron a Smurf.
1446000	1449000	I can't even remember for what reason we were in a hotel room,
1449000	1453000	but I wrote this down because I can't remember why I called her a Smurf.
1453000	1456000	She was brushing her teeth and she was like, come on, let's go.
1456000	1458000	I was like, hey, you sound like a Smurf.
1458000	1459000	That was just a riff.
1459000	1464000	But then her response was, she said, well, stop being Smurf lazy
1464000	1467000	and Smurf brush your teeth.
1467000	1469000	That's not...
1472000	1475000	I can't believe you don't know how Smurfs talk.
1475000	1481000	Smurfs, all their adjectives are Smurfs.
1481000	1486000	Okay, so say I'm going to go park the car in Smurf ease.
1486000	1490000	Okay, I'm going to go Smurf park my Smurf car.
1492000	1494000	Amazing.
1494000	1496000	You're wrong.
1496000	1500000	I'm going to go Smurf my Smurf.
1500000	1501000	Oh.
1501000	1503000	Yeah.
1503000	1505000	Well, that's stupid.
1505000	1506000	Yeah, well, they're Smurfs.
1506000	1510000	They're fucking idiots and they're all dead now.
1510000	1511000	You don't even...
1511000	1512000	It's not an adjective?
1512000	1514000	Yeah, you can't tell what the fuck they're talking about.
1514000	1516000	That's the whole point of Smurfs.
1516000	1521000	They make no Smurf when they talk.
1521000	1527000	They ask the question, how strong is context?
1527000	1529000	And they go over the line to the point where you're like,
1529000	1531000	what are you talking about?
1531000	1534000	Honey, the boss gave me a Smurf today.
1534000	1538000	Oh, fuck you or let's get married.
1538000	1541000	Depending on what I find out later, a Smurf is.
1541000	1542000	Yes, exactly.
1542000	1543000	That's the whole thing.
1543000	1546000	I go Smurf brush your Smurf teeth.
1546000	1548000	So adorable.
1548000	1550000	I can't believe that's the extent of my power.
1550000	1552000	That's what 12 years buys me.
1552000	1554000	I'm lording that over you.
1554000	1558000	You'd think I'd have bigger arms or something.
1558000	1562000	I don't know, 12 years, I should have a unicorn or something.
1562000	1566000	Instead of just some trivial knowledge about Smurfs.
1566000	1568000	No wonder I have anxiety attacks.
1568000	1569000	I'm feeling better.
1570000	1574000	Let's change that by playing Dungeons and Dragons.
1580000	1585000	Spencer, you want to take your position at the Dungeon Master table?
1585000	1588000	For those of you who have never been here before and listened before,
1588000	1592000	a couple weeks ago we started playing Dungeons and Dragons on this podcast.
1592000	1598000	I've since then learned that there are several podcasts that play Dungeons and Dragons.
1598000	1602000	Brian Postaine just launched one where that's all he's going to do.
1602000	1606000	I'm not going to let that stop me.
1606000	1609000	I don't think you guys are having a terrible time.
1609000	1610000	You guys all seem very nice.
1610000	1614000	Can we give it up for Spencer, who's really wonderful?
1614000	1616000	Thank you.
1619000	1623000	And also, can you give it up for yourselves for going to a live show?
1623000	1625000	That's exciting.
1626000	1629000	That counts as an accomplishment these days.
1629000	1631000	That's the new thing.
1631000	1636000	We were at the San Diego Zoo and we came up with an idea that I thought was pretty cool
1636000	1640000	because I heard a baby crying and you're walking around, you're so used to looking at animals
1640000	1642000	and you're seeing these signs with animals on them.
1642000	1645000	And then I heard a baby crying and I couldn't tell where it was coming from
1645000	1648000	and I was like, that would be weird if you walked around the corner
1648000	1650000	and there was a cage and it just said, baby.
1650000	1652000	There's just a baby in there.
1652000	1661000	And then I realized, baby zoo, like ingenious because practically no overhead
1661000	1664000	because we're overpopulated and they're everywhere.
1664000	1665000	But people like them.
1665000	1667000	They like looking at them.
1667000	1668000	Women love them.
1668000	1672000	And the cages are cheap because they can't go anywhere.
1672000	1680000	And then when they get old enough that they're not fun to look at for women,
1680000	1685000	you send them to an idiot zoo because they haven't learned to do anything
1685000	1689000	because they've just been babies in a zoo.
1689000	1692000	And guys would love that.
1692000	1696000	That's when you get the men money because it's like three stooges.
1696000	1701000	Imagine going through cage after cage of guys that were raised in captivity
1701000	1705000	with no exposure to any alphabet or math and they're just like eating bricks.
1705000	1709000	Guys would be like high-fiving each other.
1709000	1715000	You know, people call me crazy, but I know how to save the economy.
1715000	1716000	Baby zoo.
1716000	1720000	Or if you don't have money for idiot zoo, you get a giant take of water
1720000	1724000	and you drop all the babies in the water and then you flash freeze it.
1724000	1729000	You look crazy.
1729000	1730000	They'd all be in different positions.
1730000	1732000	One of their soft faces.
1732000	1734000	Jesus.
1734000	1736000	And then you'd slice it into different sections.
1736000	1738000	What the fuck?
1738000	1740000	And you'd ship it off to different places.
1740000	1742000	What are you, Eli Roth?
1742000	1749000	And my parents would pay for it if I'm Eli Roth.
1749000	1750000	Jeez.
1750000	1754000	I'm talking about a beautiful baby rolling around in some grass or whatever.
1754000	1755000	Me too, man.
1755000	1756000	You burn them.
1756000	1759000	You use the fertilizer for a field, right?
1759000	1762000	And you take people on a tour through the field,
1762000	1766000	but you use like baby's breath and stuff and everyone's like,
1766000	1767000	Oh, I get it.
1767000	1769000	I get it.
1769000	1772000	Or hats.
1772000	1775000	Erin Anastasia McGathey.
1775000	1776000	How dare you.
1776000	1777000	Baby zoo.
1777000	1778000	Look it up.
1778000	1779000	Baby zoo.
1779000	1780000	Don't look it up.
1780000	1781000	There won't be anything.
1781000	1784000	No, there may be something and you might get in a lot of trouble for it.
1784000	1788000	So don't look up anything.
1788000	1791000	That was another thing I thought I wanted to talk about.
1791000	1795000	He also had puppy zoo and cootie.
1795000	1798000	There's always that moment in the zoo where you look like you,
1798000	1804000	any zoo you go to, you're looking at a bangle tiger or a marmoset or a taper.
1804000	1807000	And then there's like a raccoon.
1807000	1810000	You can't figure out whether you're supposed to feel bad for it or good for it.
1810000	1813000	Like I remember taking a pee at the San Diego zoo
1813000	1816000	and there was a spider on top of the urinal and I would say,
1816000	1819000	I came out and I said, Hey, Aaron, there was a spider on the urinal.
1819000	1824000	And I bet he was trying to say to me like, Hey, how do I get in on this?
1824000	1830000	And Aaron laughed, but ironically, and said, that is such a dad joke.
1830000	1833000	Not to throw her under the bus, but just saying, maybe I,
1833000	1838000	maybe there should be a bad girlfriend too.
1838000	1839000	Unsupportive.
1839000	1842000	That raccoon is right after the polar bear exhibit.
1842000	1845000	So there's this beautiful thing called the polar bear plunge
1845000	1848000	and you're seeing them underwater and like on the ice and they're,
1848000	1851000	they're tearing apart things and they're, they're, they're talking.
1851000	1853000	They're having meetings in front of you.
1853000	1854000	It's amazing.
1854000	1857000	And then there's a raccoon right next to it.
1857000	1858000	And you can't see him.
1858000	1859000	He's hiding.
1859000	1860000	Of course he's hiding.
1860000	1864000	He's like, I, yeah, I could be right outside the cage
1864000	1865000	and I would do nothing different.
1865000	1866000	Fuck you guys.
1866000	1867000	I'm cool.
1867000	1868000	Hand-luking this.
1868000	1870000	I will be inside if you need me.
1870000	1873000	Speaking of like people's zoos, I'm sorry, Spencer.
1873000	1877000	Have you ever, have you ever worked at a haunted house?
1877000	1878000	Oh, you're talking to me.
1878000	1880000	I thought you said I'm sorry, Spencer.
1880000	1882000	Have you ever worked at a haunted house?
1882000	1883000	I thought you were insulting him.
1883000	1885000	I'm sorry, Spencer, but.
1885000	1887000	You just look like you're really creepy.
1887000	1890000	I'm sorry, Spencer, but shouldn't you be being paid to scare people
1890000	1892000	right now for the March of Dimes?
1892000	1896000	Has anyone, has anyone ever volunteered or worked at a haunted house here?
1896000	1897000	Clap your hands.
1897000	1898000	Yeah.
1898000	1900000	It's kind of like being at a zoo.
1900000	1904000	You sit in one little station and all day long you do one thing,
1904000	1910000	like jump out of a coffin or be afraid by a hanger or.
1910000	1911000	Yeah.
1911000	1912000	Afraid by a hanger.
1912000	1915000	It's the, I would say that's the mommy dearest exhibit,
1915000	1919000	but there's no 40-year-olds here that would laugh at it.
1919000	1923000	The, God damn it.
1923000	1924000	She doesn't see you.
1924000	1926000	Stop being smurf lazy and smurf brush your teeth.
1926000	1927000	I just keep seeing that.
1927000	1930000	Sorry, I got my little, my little file.
1930000	1932000	And then one last thing.
1932000	1934000	This is the last thing.
1934000	1936000	After this we're off-roting.
1936000	1937000	Okay.
1937000	1940000	Up until now it's been a Ruby on Rails.
1941000	1945000	I was just having drinks with Erin before the show.
1945000	1947000	It's here for Erin.
1947000	1948000	Across the street.
1948000	1950000	Thanks guys.
1950000	1954000	And we split a little burger patty because of our stupid diet.
1954000	1958000	And then they, so they brought the check and they put two little meringues on it,
1958000	1959000	which we can't eat.
1959000	1963000	But Erin took the meringues and put them in her purse and said,
1963000	1967000	I'm hiding these because I don't want to hurt her feelings.
1967000	1968000	That's it.
1968000	1969000	I wrote it down.
1969000	1973000	Like the waitress has a relationship with the meringues.
1973000	1978000	When I was eight, I went to dinner with my mom and her childhood best friend
1978000	1981000	and her childhood best friend made steak and like put it down on the table
1981000	1983000	and I took a bite of it and I said to my mom like,
1983000	1985000	this tastes like rubber.
1985000	1987000	And my mom took it and threw it in her purse and she was like,
1987000	1989000	shut up.
1989000	1993000	And I sat there and it was like, her best friend Denise came back in the room.
1993000	1995000	She's like, whoa, big appetite.
1995000	1996000	And my mom's like, big appetite.
1996000	2001000	And I was like, big appetite.
2001000	2003000	And my mom had to throw away her purse.
2003000	2008000	Like she had meat in her purse.
2008000	2009000	RIP.
2009000	2013000	I'm pulling the chair like Bill Cosby because the so fucking low key tonight.
2013000	2015000	Talk about a trip to the dentist for 45 minutes.
2015000	2016000	I don't care.
2016000	2019000	No, I guess because we're playing Dungeons and Dragons and I'm going to nail it.
2019000	2021000	Am I playing Jeff's character?
2021000	2022000	I guess we should just transition.
2022000	2025000	I have a little surprise for you.
2025000	2027000	Okay.
2027000	2032000	Just you just sit tight and let me play Dungeons and Dragons by myself.
2032000	2035000	Surprise.
2035000	2038000	Do I need my character sheet?
2038000	2040000	Spencer, how are you tonight?
2040000	2041000	I'm doing pretty good.
2041000	2042000	How are you?
2042000	2043000	I'm good.
2043000	2046000	Good.
2046000	2049000	This is engaging podcast talk.
2049000	2050000	Thank you.
2050000	2053000	Sarcasmos.
2053000	2055000	Spencer, you look very healthy.
2055000	2057000	What?
2057000	2062000	I thought it was the first time that's ever been said to me.
2062000	2064000	You look spry and your cheeks are rosy.
2064000	2066000	You look healthy.
2066000	2067000	Okay.
2067000	2068000	I'm sorry.
2068000	2070000	I'm possessed by a dying Jewish woman, I guess.
2070000	2071000	I'm sorry.
2071000	2072000	Well, thank you.
2072000	2073000	All right.
2073000	2076000	To recap as quickly as possible, I am Sharpie Butz a lot.
2076000	2079000	I am a first level wizard.
2079000	2088000	I have recently become friends with my previous rival, Quark, played by Jeff Davis.
2088000	2093000	We fought a giant piggy bank and beat it.
2093000	2095000	And then we got some treasure.
2095000	2101000	And now I refuse just because Jeff's not here to not play the game.
2101000	2104000	So, Spencer, tell me where I am and what's going on.
2104000	2105000	Well, you're still in the cave.
2105000	2111000	And after putting most of your treasure away, you notice a strange wooden box.
2111000	2114000	For the podcast listeners, I have this physical box.
2114000	2115000	Come and take it, please.
2115000	2116000	Oh, my God.
2116000	2119000	Whoa.
2119000	2124000	This wooden box is stained purple with engraved stars and celestial bodies on its surface.
2124000	2125000	Oh, my God.
2125000	2128000	Spencer's proposing to dance.
2128000	2130000	Oh, my God.
2130000	2139000	You know, Dan, it's been great on this podcast in the past few weeks.
2139000	2141000	I hope this campaign never ends.
2141000	2145000	I know we took it to the next level in our relationship last week with that hug.
2145000	2149000	It meant a lot to me.
2149000	2154000	Will you please level up with me forever and become immortal?
2154000	2155000	All right.
2155000	2156000	Well, wait.
2156000	2161000	So, if I open it in real life, Spencer handed me a real box.
2161000	2162000	This is a little weird.
2162000	2165000	Just like Sharpie Butzlot found in his treasure.
2165000	2168000	So, if I open it in real life, I'm opening it in the game, right?
2168000	2169000	Yeah.
2169000	2171000	And if you open it in real life and it's a trap, you're going to die.
2171000	2172000	Oh, my God.
2172000	2175000	Someone tape it.
2175000	2176000	All right.
2176000	2181000	Well, I'm not going to open it because I don't know if you know this about my character,
2181000	2183000	but I'm a pussy.
2183000	2187000	I have a lot of anxiety.
2187000	2190000	What happens if I cast detect magic on it?
2190000	2194000	You detect a small trace of unearthly magic coming from inside the box,
2194000	2197000	but the box itself does not seem magical.
2197000	2198000	All right.
2198000	2201000	I examine it as much as I can for any kind of mechanisms,
2201000	2206000	like, you know, strings that lead to guns that are pointing at my face.
2206000	2212000	You look it over thoroughly and find that it doesn't appear to be trapped or mechanized in any way.
2212000	2215000	I very carefully open the box.
2215000	2219000	Opening the box very carefully, you see a small stone inside.
2219000	2220000	I do.
2220000	2223000	In real life, I do, too.
2223000	2225000	That's the beauty of it.
2225000	2229000	Oh, well, I touched the stone in real life, but I'm not doing that in the game.
2229000	2230000	You can.
2230000	2232000	I mean, it's not going to kill you.
2232000	2233000	Oh, all right.
2233000	2234000	Maybe I just gave it to you.
2234000	2236000	Spencer, I'm right here.
2236000	2240000	Right here.
2241000	2242000	What?
2242000	2244000	Inside lay a small iridescent stone.
2244000	2248000	Its surface shines in many colors and shape is confusing,
2248000	2250000	full of squared spirals and tiny ridges.
2250000	2251000	Yes.
2251000	2253000	Kind of like your relationship.
2253000	2259000	This is all an integrated marketing campaign for Spencer's girlfriend
2259000	2264000	who owns a surf shop where she makes shitty jewelry.
2264000	2266000	But that's beads on Pacific Avenue.
2266000	2273000	You find yourself enamored with this unique design, which can be ordered online.
2273000	2274000	It's called a quiggle.
2274000	2278000	It's supposed to bring you luck in finance.
2278000	2279000	Sorry.
2279000	2282000	Grasping the stone in your hand, you feel its surface warm up
2282000	2285000	and your surroundings fade to white and you lose consciousness.
2285000	2286000	What?
2286000	2289000	The next thing you know, you're outside the trove again.
2289000	2292000	The stone glows brightly, then fades to dimness.
2292000	2296000	This must be the fragment of greatness that Derevan sent you for.
2296000	2297000	Oh, that's right.
2297000	2301000	The scryer who sent me and my friend of cork to the trove
2301000	2303000	said that there was a fragment of greatness.
2303000	2304000	I found the...
2304000	2306000	Did you say I teleported?
2306000	2307000	Yeah.
2307000	2311000	When you lost consciousness and when you came to, you were outside the trove.
2311000	2312000	And it was an anxiety.
2312000	2314000	It might have been.
2314000	2315000	All right.
2315000	2316000	But I teleported.
2316000	2318000	Sharpie as his demons.
2318000	2319000	All right.
2319000	2321000	Well, then I'm done with that trove.
2321000	2323000	I'm going back to town.
2323000	2324000	All right.
2324000	2326000	The road back to Thornvale is wrong.
2326000	2330000	Well, it's long, but you are confident after finding the fragment of greatness.
2330000	2333000	You see the familiar green rows of fields surrounding Thornvale
2333000	2336000	and it fills you with a sense of comfort and calm.
2336000	2337000	It's true.
2337000	2341000	On your left, you see a stables and just pass it, the local tavern.
2341000	2342000	Now, I didn't come up with a tavern name.
2342000	2345000	I thought the audience might want to name the tavern, maybe.
2345000	2346000	All right.
2346000	2347000	What's your name, sir?
2347000	2348000	David.
2349000	2351000	Madlib style.
2351000	2353000	Do you want to name a tavern?
2353000	2354000	Sure.
2354000	2355000	Take your time.
2355000	2357000	I'm going to make a drink and we can edit out the pause.
2357000	2358000	So just take your time.
2358000	2362000	You're not under any pressure to be as magnificently witty
2362000	2365000	and quick as I have been tonight.
2368000	2371000	Just listen to this music and think of a tavern name.
2371000	2374000	Erin, you can talk about pantyhose or something, Will.
2374000	2376000	Ah, pantyhose.
2377000	2381000	For times when you feel like your legs are a little too pale
2381000	2387000	or for when you are dating someone who says that he likes pantyhose.
2391000	2393000	Pantyhose.
2393000	2397000	For ladies who want to feel like Sigourney Weaver in the 80s.
2397000	2399000	But have varicose veins.
2399000	2401000	Pantyhose.
2401000	2404000	For when you have a meeting in the morning and a burglary at night.
2405000	2406000	Pantyhose.
2415000	2416000	For the record.
2416000	2418000	I wore tights and pantyhose before we dated.
2418000	2419000	I know.
2419000	2420000	That's important to me.
2420000	2421000	I know.
2421000	2422000	I know you know.
2423000	2425000	This isn't awkward at all.
2427000	2430000	What do you think I liked you?
2431000	2434000	Because of my insecure brain.
2434000	2435000	Alright.
2436000	2437000	I love you.
2437000	2438000	I love you too.
2438000	2442000	Thank you for taking my anxiety attack away at the San Diego Zoo.
2442000	2443000	Well, I care about you.
2443000	2445000	I want you to feel better.
2447000	2448000	What was your name again?
2450000	2451000	David.
2451000	2453000	Alright, David, what's the tavern name?
2453000	2456000	It's a Chacha's Tavern.
2456000	2457000	Chacha's Tavern, alright.
2457000	2459000	I think that's in Silver Lake, isn't it?
2460000	2462000	It's not a tavern in Silver Lake.
2462000	2463000	It's a bar.
2463000	2465000	Chacha's Tavern.
2465000	2467000	Chacha's Tavern.
2467000	2470000	The tavern is a welcoming place.
2470000	2475000	It has a large lounge with polished tables and a puffy chairs and a long bar.
2475000	2478000	Several humans, gnomes, elves and halflings are mingling.
2478000	2483000	And a gnome is standing on the counter pouring steins of beer from a large keg.
2483000	2485000	I assume that Quark and I kind of...
2485000	2489000	Quark's a bit tired after his rage.
2489000	2490000	He's not saying much.
2490000	2491000	He's kind of...
2491000	2492000	Oh, is he with me?
2492000	2493000	Yeah, he's just hanging out.
2493000	2494000	Oh, okay.
2494000	2495000	Hey, Quark.
2495000	2496000	He's doing a show in Chicago, right?
2496000	2497000	Well, why don't we get a...
2497000	2498000	Why don't we get a...
2498000	2499000	I'm gonna go...
2499000	2502000	I'm gonna talk to the tavern keep about getting a room.
2502000	2504000	Do they have rooms to let at this tavern?
2504000	2508000	Yeah, this tavern has an upper floor with some rooms.
2508000	2509000	Alright.
2509000	2510000	Alright.
2510000	2511000	Tavern.
2511000	2513000	So you head up to the tavern keeper.
2513000	2514000	Yeah.
2514000	2516000	He's this gnome standing on the counter.
2516000	2518000	His name is Chacha.
2518000	2521000	He's the bartender and the keeper of the tavern.
2521000	2523000	He's a white-haired gnome with thin beard.
2523000	2525000	And he sees you coming up and he's like,
2525000	2528000	What'll you drink?
2528000	2531000	I'll have a flaggin' of ale.
2531000	2532000	A flaggin' of ale?
2532000	2533000	That'll be three copper.
2533000	2534000	Oh, alright.
2534000	2539000	Well, a bargain at twice the price, methinks.
2539000	2541000	What say you for two rooms?
2541000	2545000	A tuppence or a shilling for Wayne's cutting?
2546000	2550000	I could part with two rooms for only three silvers.
2550000	2551000	Alright.
2551000	2552000	Here's...
2552000	2554000	I assume I have three silvers.
2554000	2556000	Actually, you only got gold pieces from the treasure.
2556000	2558000	You don't even...
2558000	2560000	I'm so sorry.
2561000	2562000	Accident.
2562000	2564000	They hate gold.
2568000	2569000	I'm very sorry.
2569000	2571000	It's an accident.
2571000	2575000	Erin just put her elbow on her soundboard iPad app.
2575000	2578000	I thought it was a boing.
2578000	2581000	It doesn't make as much...
2581000	2582000	Ooh!
2582000	2585000	No, I thought that was a hooray.
2585000	2586000	Sorry.
2586000	2589000	It's mixed pretty high, Nespah.
2589000	2590000	Like for...
2590000	2592000	Alright.
2594000	2595000	Here's a gold piece.
2595000	2597000	Keep the change.
2597000	2598000	Oh, wow.
2598000	2599000	A high ruler, eh?
2599000	2601000	Are you an adventurer?
2601000	2603000	Yes.
2603000	2606000	Yes, and I'm new to Maine.
2606000	2611000	I've never been in the lighthouse district.
2611000	2617000	Yes, I'm an adventurer, and I'd like to make sure our rooms are particularly safe,
2617000	2621000	so keep the change in exchange for your constant vigilance.
2621000	2624000	Much obliged, sir, but have you seen this?
2624000	2626000	Emotions to a poster on the wall.
2626000	2628000	It's a wanted poster.
2628000	2631000	It says Wanted, the Ember Mauler.
2631000	2635000	There's a picture that looks like a lion with a flaming mane
2635000	2639000	and some two tails it's made with pastel crayons.
2639000	2641000	There you go. That's good.
2642000	2645000	The charred dismembered corpses of cats, dogs,
2645000	2649000	and most recently a thorn veil mare have been found,
2649000	2653000	and reports of black burnt crops have been made in the fields.
2653000	2656000	30 silver pieces for any information on this beast
2656000	2659000	or 1,400 gold pieces for its head.
2659000	2661000	Interesting. Thanks for the tip.
2661000	2665000	As you read the sign, you notice someone seems to be staring at you
2665000	2668000	and seeing you look at the sign.
2668000	2670000	Am I noticing them peripherally?
2670000	2673000	You just feel the sense of being watched.
2673000	2675000	I look at them.
2676000	2678000	You see a tall, thin...
2678000	2679000	Is it an elf?
2679000	2681000	No, it's a half elf.
2681000	2682000	Loved by all.
2683000	2685000	Loved by all.
2685000	2687000	Standing with a bow
2687000	2690000	and a sheath sword in the corner of the room.
2690000	2694000	He seems to be interested in your looking at the poster.
2695000	2699000	All right, so for the podcast listeners, this is Erin's character.
2699000	2701000	Yeah!
2701000	2703000	God damn it.
2703000	2706000	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2706000	2708000	I have a sheet.
2708000	2709000	Thank you.
2709000	2711000	How could this go wrong?
2711000	2713000	Good morrow, sir, butts a lot.
2713000	2716000	Marks a lot, sharpie.
2716000	2718000	You know my name.
2718000	2720000	I have heard of you.
2722000	2725000	You have me at a disadvantage, mister...
2725000	2727000	Sedana.
2727000	2729000	Mulrane.
2731000	2734000	May I bow to you?
2737000	2740000	I can't stop you?
2741000	2743000	Well, regard me bowing,
2743000	2745000	for it is a great honor to be...
2745000	2748000	to witness the bow of an elf human.
2748000	2750000	Bow.
2750000	2752000	I'm also a ranger.
2752000	2754000	Your bow is so loud.
2755000	2756000	I...
2756000	2759000	Well, I have put on my loud robes today.
2762000	2765000	Tell me what you know of this lion.
2765000	2769000	I know that I just started looking at it on a sign.
2769000	2772000	And that then you started staring at me.
2772000	2774000	And that now you say you know me
2774000	2776000	and are bowing loudly.
2776000	2778000	You and I are on the same page now,
2778000	2779000	across the board.
2779000	2781000	We are all caught up.
2781000	2785000	Well, I could sense your energy across the room, dear sir.
2785000	2787000	I feel like you and I shall be friends forever,
2787000	2789000	and I shall be involved in every adventure
2789000	2792000	that you have from here on out.
2792000	2794000	Thank you.
2799000	2801000	Interesting.
2802000	2804000	Regard my bow.
2804000	2805000	Oh.
2805000	2807000	It's so cloying.
2807000	2809000	And...
2809000	2811000	invasive.
2812000	2813000	Like its owner.
2813000	2815000	May I join your team?
2815000	2816000	What's that?
2816000	2817000	May I join your team?
2817000	2820000	I recognize that you and your lover are on a long journey.
2820000	2823000	All right, hold on a second.
2823000	2825000	I just want to stop you there.
2825000	2827000	He's a very good friend of mine.
2827000	2829000	We met in the howling mines.
2829000	2832000	It seems that his face is at dick height, yes?
2840000	2842000	I don't wish to be disrespectful, sir.
2842000	2844000	Only understanding.
2844000	2846000	Can I inquire as to your specialties,
2846000	2848000	what you're bringing to the table?
2848000	2850000	Should we go on an adventure together?
2850000	2854000	For now, I shall let you know one of my special abilities.
2854000	2859000	For I am full of mystery, and that makes people like me more.
2860000	2862000	I am immune to sleep.
2864000	2866000	Let us adventure.
2867000	2868000	Do you like cookies?
2868000	2870000	I also have cookies.
2870000	2872000	That's not... that's okay, right?
2872000	2874000	You got cookies, yeah.
2875000	2878000	Yeah, I like the cut of your jib.
2879000	2880000	Thank you, sir.
2881000	2884000	I think that I just have to make sure
2884000	2886000	that you're not going to murder us in our sleep.
2886000	2888000	Oh, of course not, sir.
2888000	2890000	I have never been known to murder.
2890000	2892000	In fact, I'm kneeling.
2893000	2896000	I'm taking my hand and I'm crossing it across my chest.
2896000	2900000	Sir, all of the...
2901000	2906000	Sedanas have been onerous since the beginning.
2906000	2909000	We existed with the dinosaurs.
2911000	2915000	And the fungi and the rocks and the storms.
2916000	2919000	We have always been here bringing goodness to the world,
2919000	2922000	and no harm has been inflicted
2923000	2926000	on part by part.
2926000	2928000	We haven't done anything wrong.
2931000	2933000	I accept your oath.
2933000	2935000	I grew up in a family without honor,
2935000	2938000	and I appreciate people who have it.
2938000	2940000	I've always dreamed of being part of a family
2940000	2948000	that had some kind of tether to the realm of good things.
2948000	2951000	Aye, aye, we'll speak no more! Adventure!
2951000	2953000	Yes.
2953000	2956000	Let's bound out of the tavern into adventure
2956000	2959000	while my gnome friend sleeps.
2960000	2962000	If you would like to be alone with your sleeping gnome friend,
2962000	2964000	I understand.
2964000	2968000	Listen, man, you got the wrong idea about that.
2969000	2971000	Like, I barely know the guy.
2971000	2974000	We go on adventures together, okay?
2974000	2976000	And I'm not saying there'd be anything wrong with it
2976000	2979000	if we were partners in that sense.
2979000	2982000	I'm just saying it's not the way it is.
2982000	2984000	You got the wrong idea, man.
2984000	2988000	As the earth is unashamed of his rivers.
2989000	2992000	Honesty is like water.
2992000	2995000	Let your water flow and be happy.
2995000	2997000	Adventure!
2998000	2999000	All right.
2999000	3002000	Well, I feel like an adventure would take too long
3002000	3004000	at this point.
3004000	3006000	I've come a long way.
3007000	3009000	And we need to sleep.
3009000	3012000	Fine. Well, I am immune to sleep,
3012000	3014000	so enjoy your sleep.
3014000	3018000	I shall dance and plan and dream and sing.
3019000	3022000	Are you staying here in the tavern?
3022000	3024000	Yes, I am not leaving you.
3025000	3027000	Ever.
3027000	3030000	I am part of this.
3032000	3034000	I should go up to Quirk's room and ask him
3034000	3040000	if he's willing to have Solomon Goldberg?
3040000	3042000	What's your name?
3042000	3044000	Quite all right.
3044000	3046000	Moraine Sedana.
3046000	3048000	You head up the stairs to Quirk's room.
3048000	3050000	You open the door.
3050000	3052000	Quirk is trying to get to sleep,
3052000	3054000	but he hasn't quite got to sleep.
3054000	3056000	He seems kind of bothered.
3056000	3059000	I nudge him gently.
3059000	3061000	What?
3061000	3063000	Quirk...
3063000	3065000	This is...
3065000	3069000	Solana Gomez.
3071000	3073000	I just want to get the quick verification
3073000	3075000	that she will be involved permanently
3075000	3077000	in all her adventures forever.
3078000	3080000	Well, does she have a bow?
3080000	3082000	Do I have a bow?
3082000	3084000	Does the earth have dirt?
3084000	3085000	Do the oceans have water?
3085000	3087000	Yes, I have a bow!
3087000	3088000	Adventure!
3088000	3090000	Will you guys let me sleep?
3090000	3092000	Yes, I know that you're
3092000	3094000	metaphorically out of town
3094000	3096000	by being in bed.
3096000	3099000	And your butt is full of cum!
3100000	3102000	That's not true.
3102000	3105000	I don't know where you got that impression.
3105000	3108000	This is a giant mythical planet
3108000	3110000	full of people traveling in all kinds of combinations.
3110000	3113000	This isn't the first time two dudes have hung out together.
3113000	3114000	Why do you keep...
3114000	3116000	Your fixation is making me think
3116000	3118000	that there's shit up with you.
3118000	3121000	When you're ready, you'll be ready.
3122000	3124000	All right, well, then we all go to sleep
3124000	3125000	for the night.
3125000	3128000	Do you have a room, Sadana?
3128000	3130000	It's Hussein?
3131000	3133000	Moraine Sadana.
3133000	3134000	Yes, I have my room.
3134000	3136000	My room is the forest.
3136000	3139000	Okay, go to sleep in the woods and we'll...
3139000	3143000	I am immune to sleep, so I will walk the woods.
3143000	3144000	It's quite all right, sir.
3144000	3146000	Let's meet at six in the lobby.
3148000	3149000	All right.
3149000	3150000	Yes.
3150000	3151000	Okay, Spencer, everybody.
3151000	3152000	Go do the dragon.
3152000	3153000	Thank you, Spencer.
3159000	3162000	All right, so it comes to this point in the show
3162000	3163000	when we...
3163000	3165000	And this has happened before.
3165000	3166000	When we're trying to figure out
3166000	3168000	how this isn't the worst harm in town ever.
3168000	3169000	Like, what is it?
3169000	3170000	What do we do?
3170000	3171000	We've got to go for broke.
3171000	3172000	We've got to do something.
3172000	3173000	Okay.
3173000	3175000	So we have to close up the show.
3175000	3180000	We have to go to a weird, personal, revelatory,
3180000	3183000	exciting, interesting place.
3183000	3184000	Okay.
3184000	3185000	Help me out.
3185000	3186000	All right.
3188000	3191000	Weird, personal for you and I?
3191000	3193000	I don't know.
3193000	3195000	Well, it's not going to be for any of them.
3195000	3196000	I don't know them.
3197000	3198000	Oh, I smell...
3198000	3199000	I like your shirt.
3199000	3200000	Thanks.
3200000	3201000	Let's get deep.
3201000	3202000	All right.
3202000	3203000	I like your shirt.
3203000	3205000	I'll take another look at my phone, I swear.
3206000	3208000	We're going to remind people about Jareth, Halloween.
3208000	3210000	Everybody dresses Jareth as Halloween.
3210000	3212000	Jareth from the lab.
3212000	3215000	Did we announce that Jeff has hired a costumer
3215000	3217000	for his costume?
3217000	3218000	It's true.
3218000	3219000	This shit is on.
3219000	3222000	We were having a conversation about Halloween
3222000	3224000	and, yeah, Jeff...
3224000	3225000	Hired a costumer.
3225000	3228000	He told us he was going to a fitting for a television show.
3228000	3230000	And then, like, we were hanging out with him
3230000	3232000	and he had to go several times.
3232000	3233000	And I was like, what is your fitting for?
3233000	3235000	And he's like, I'll tell you.
3235000	3236000	Because he doesn't...
3236000	3237000	He's not a liar and didn't want to lie
3237000	3239000	and told us that he was getting fitted for his costume.
3239000	3242000	So we got to measure up.
3242000	3243000	Jareth.
3243000	3244000	Jareth is the character.
3244000	3247000	I'm very excited because that movie meant a lot to me
3247000	3249000	as a kid, a big deal.
3249000	3251000	Shaped me a lot, sexually.
3253000	3255000	You know what meant a lot to me is RoboCop.
3255000	3256000	If I ever get the nuts up...
3256000	3258000	Thank you, gentlemen.
3258000	3259000	Ladies.
3260000	3261000	If I ever get the nuts up,
3261000	3263000	I'd like to make a really good RoboCop costume.
3263000	3266000	And I heard they're remaking RoboCop.
3266000	3268000	They're remaking everything.
3268000	3269000	I'm not gonna...
3269000	3271000	I feel like I'm being baited to go,
3271000	3272000	oh, don't remake it.
3272000	3273000	I don't care.
3273000	3274000	Just bury me.
3275000	3276000	Dan.
3276000	3278000	Bury me in your remake, Pete Moss.
3278000	3279000	I get what you're doing.
3279000	3281000	You're telling me that you don't care
3281000	3283000	if I come to the movies anymore.
3283000	3284000	I get it.
3284000	3285000	It's not my money that you're after.
3285000	3286000	How about this?
3286000	3287000	It's 18-year-old people.
3287000	3289000	I don't know what total recall is.
3289000	3291000	I don't know what RoboCop is.
3291000	3292000	I feel...
3292000	3294000	How do you think that makes me feel, Hollywood?
3295000	3296000	It's a bummer.
3296000	3297000	RoboCop's a perfect movie.
3297000	3298000	You don't have to...
3298000	3299000	As your...
3299000	3300000	What the hell?
3300000	3301000	First of all...
3301000	3302000	All right.
3302000	3303000	Fucking...
3303000	3305000	You know what's great about RoboCop?
3305000	3307000	It wasn't a goddamn remake.
3308000	3309000	What the fuck?
3309000	3312000	Listen to the title of the fucking movie.
3312000	3314000	Do you know how dumb sounding that is?
3314000	3315000	RoboCop?
3315000	3317000	And the poster is a dude
3317000	3320000	that fucking looks like the Tin Man.
3320000	3321000	He just...
3321000	3322000	That's it.
3322000	3325000	He just looks like the modern version of the Tin Man.
3325000	3328000	Modern circa 1986.
3328000	3329000	Whatever it was.
3329000	3330000	87.
3330000	3331000	88.
3331000	3332000	I think it was 88.
3332000	3333000	What was it?
3333000	3334000	You know.
3334000	3335000	You're not in your head.
3335000	3336000	I saw you.
3336000	3337000	Okay.
3337000	3338000	I thought it was like Ed Newmeyer's kid was here.
3338000	3339000	No, it was a poster.
3339000	3340000	It's a fucking guy.
3340000	3342000	It's just Peter Weller encased in fucking plastic.
3342000	3344000	It was a fucking dumb robot suit.
3344000	3345000	And the poster said,
3345000	3348000	part man, part machine, all cop.
3348000	3350000	And you did RoboCop.
3350000	3352000	Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
3352000	3354000	But here's the crazy thing.
3354000	3356000	Great movie.
3356000	3359000	Amazing movie.
3359000	3360000	And it didn't...
3360000	3362000	It wasn't a revisitation of anything.
3362000	3364000	So now you're revisiting it.
3364000	3365000	Why?
3365000	3366000	Like can't...
3366000	3369000	How hard can it be to make another RoboCop
3369000	3371000	without calling it RoboCop?
3371000	3373000	Speaker head.
3374000	3375000	I'm looking across the room.
3375000	3376000	I see a speaker.
3376000	3378000	Speaker head.
3378000	3380000	Part speaker.
3380000	3382000	Part head.
3382000	3386000	All crossing guard.
3386000	3388000	I'm proving the theory wrong, aren't I?
3388000	3390000	Maybe it's not that easy.
3390000	3391000	But an hour?
3391000	3392000	If you had an hour?
3392000	3393000	Dan.
3393000	3394000	Come on.
3394000	3396000	My guy's a fucking unicorn octopus.
3396000	3399000	A shoe hamburger.
3399000	3401000	Salt.
3401000	3402000	A giant.
3402000	3405000	Ice, ice, ice monster.
3405000	3408000	Fucking meatballs nine.
3408000	3409000	Wait, no, no, no, sorry.
3409000	3411000	Dan, I think you should stop here naming all of
3411000	3414000	Rob Schneider's next ten movies.
3414000	3415000	Jank Lee.
3415000	3416000	Lumber.
3416000	3417000	Giant termite.
3417000	3418000	Dan.
3418000	3419000	Giant anything.
3419000	3420000	Dan.
3420000	3421000	We haven't made everything giant.
3421000	3422000	Just give me a second, baby.
3422000	3425000	I'm talking to friends.
3425000	3427000	I'll be to bed in a second.
3427000	3428000	Giant anything.
3428000	3429000	Giant beer bottle.
3429000	3431000	Giant, giant, giant, giant, giant,
3431000	3434000	giant, giant piece of fucking glass.
3434000	3436000	What about that, what about that video now about
3436000	3438000	that guy that puts the mason jar up his ass,
3438000	3440000	you know, and it breaks in his ass,
3440000	3442000	and then he pulls the broken glass out of his ass.
3442000	3444000	Maybe there's a movie there.
3444000	3446000	Adapt it into something.
3446000	3447000	What was that guy thinking?
3447000	3448000	What's he doing?
3448000	3450000	It's a modern day Frankenstein.
3450000	3451000	Just called glass.
3451000	3453000	Yeah, I don't know, glass.
3453000	3456000	But yeah, there's a hyphen between the L and the A.
3456000	3464000	Insects decide that they're at war with people.
3464000	3468000	The sky, the sky is a monster.
3468000	3471000	The sky, the hole in the ozone becomes a mouth.
3471000	3472000	The sky is a monster.
3472000	3477000	How do you run from the only thing you've ever been under?
3477000	3479000	Fucking done.
3479000	3481000	Taking 90 minutes to write it.
3481000	3483000	It's called Chicken Huge.
3483000	3486000	Maybe it's good, maybe it's bad.
3486000	3488000	Make 10 of them.
3488000	3490000	One of them is going to be good on accident.
3490000	3492000	Die Hard wasn't made by geniuses.
3492000	3494000	It was just fucking stop it.
3494000	3495000	Knock it off.
3495000	3499000	Stop trying to figure out the system of how to guarantee
3499000	3502000	your movie is going to make money based on the variables
3502000	3505000	of, well, you take Matt Damon and you put a minute,
3505000	3508000	and then you take this thing that is where the wild things are.
3508000	3509000	That was a hit book.
3509000	3513000	Then you shoot it in 3D and you guarantee the overseas.
3513000	3515000	Come on, man.
3515000	3518000	People used to wing it a little bit.
3518000	3525000	Dan hates romantic comedies because he hates the idea
3525000	3527000	of people cheating on people, and he's convinced that
3527000	3531000	every romantic comedy is about people cheating on people.
3531000	3534000	Recently, Dan and I got in a very, very big fight
3534000	3538000	because I never asked Dan to watch romantic comedies with me,
3538000	3543000	but I wait until he's asleep, and then I put on a romantic comedy,
3543000	3547000	and I was watching The Five Year Engagement with Allison Brie
3547000	3549000	from your fucking show.
3549000	3552000	It wasn't a five-year engagement.
3552000	3556000	It was a two-year relationship, and then they broke up for two years,
3556000	3558000	and then they got back together.
3558000	3560000	You didn't watch the movie.
3560000	3562000	You didn't watch any of it.
3562000	3564000	He woke up in the middle in a fever dream,
3564000	3568000	and he was like, fucking romantic comedies, movie industry,
3568000	3573000	you cheat on somebody, get together, and no, I want to be with somebody,
3573000	3577000	and I kiss a little Brie like insane.
3577000	3580000	I realize I want to be with you because I kissed this person,
3580000	3583000	and then we're like, fuck, and I'm about to make a million movies.
3583000	3587000	It's like going to a salt restaurant.
3587000	3589000	It's a seasoning.
3589000	3590000	Romance is a fucking seasoning.
3590000	3592000	It's not a plot point.
3592000	3593000	You're killing me.
3593000	3594000	You're killing me.
3594000	3596000	No, I don't disagree with you.
3596000	3597000	He hadn't watched the movie.
3597000	3598000	I watched it when he was asleep.
3598000	3600000	I leaned over, and I was like, oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
3600000	3601000	Don't be upset.
3601000	3602000	I kissed him.
3602000	3605000	He shoved me off of him, and he's like, fucking cheating,
3605000	3608000	and he just associated me with the cheating and the moving.
3608000	3609000	I was asleep.
3609000	3612000	You're not putting this, I talk in my sleep.
3612000	3613000	He was asleep.
3613000	3614000	And I was asleep.
3614000	3618000	That's not, you're making everyone think I'm a weird Scarface.
3618000	3619000	I talk in my sleep.
3619000	3621000	He had a desk with all this cocaine and then these guns,
3621000	3622000	and they were his friends.
3622000	3624000	I talk in my sleep.
3624000	3626000	Will you tell him the thing I said?
3626000	3628000	What was the thing?
3628000	3630000	Which thing?
3630000	3631000	You talk in the sleep.
3631000	3632000	You sleep all the time.
3632000	3635000	The shittles thing.
3635000	3637000	Dan talks in the sleep all the time,
3637000	3638000	and sometimes I can understand.
3638000	3645000	I write it down, and it sounded like a movie pitch.
3645000	3646000	I can remember it.
3646000	3648000	He said, it's the 70s.
3648000	3650000	I said, it's the 70s.
3650000	3652000	But it was, it's the 70s.
3652000	3654000	It's rain.
3654000	3656000	It's gone.
3656000	3658000	What was the middle part of that?
3658000	3659000	They're all shooting us.
3659000	3660000	They're all shooting us.
3660000	3663000	I said, I'm supposed to come down here.
3663000	3664000	It's gone.
3664000	3667000	Shittles.
3667000	3670000	Shittles.
3670000	3671000	It was like a pitch.
3671000	3672000	It sounds good.
3672000	3674000	I'm developing in my sleep.
3674000	3675000	It's the 70s.
3675000	3680000	In a world where disco is the way you dance,
3680000	3682000	and bullets are what you use.
3682000	3684000	Shittles.
3684000	3687000	Don't make them angry.
3687000	3691000	They'll dance all over you with their poop.
3691000	3692000	They'll dance all over you.
3692000	3697000	I'm just saying.
3697000	3700000	Here's the thing about movies.
3700000	3702000	Yeah.
3702000	3704000	You can just make them up as you go.
3704000	3706000	Speaking of making them up,
3706000	3712000	Dan and I did an improvised movie like a month ago.
3712000	3714000	Where's this going?
3714000	3718000	Could we get a suggestion of a moody title?
3718000	3719000	Wait.
3719000	3722000	You want to close the show with more improv movie things?
3722000	3724000	Can we hash out the rom-com thing?
3724000	3726000	Because when you and I talk about it
3726000	3728000	and there's no one else around,
3728000	3731000	it's seriously, I swear to God, it sounds like a bit.
3731000	3734000	We've never fought about anything more severely.
3734000	3735000	Here's the thing.
3735000	3737000	I never make you watch them,
3737000	3739000	and you get mad at me for watching them
3739000	3742000	and then tell me that it's not a big deal that I watch them.
3742000	3744000	I don't make you watch them.
3744000	3747000	You don't make me watch them,
3747000	3750000	but then I go to the sci-fi fantasy section
3750000	3752000	and you kind of like,
3752000	3754000	come on, you roll your eyes a little bit.
3754000	3755000	No, I don't.
3755000	3757000	The time that you're talking about
3757000	3759000	was after a very big fight we had
3759000	3762000	where you were in the wrong,
3762000	3764000	and I made a bit saying like,
3764000	3766000	well, I thought you were going to get a hug.
3766000	3767000	Exactly.
3767000	3769000	We got in a fight about something else.
3769000	3771000	You went to the bathroom and I started picking out a movie
3771000	3774000	and it came back and you looked at the section I was looking in,
3774000	3777000	which is what I would like to call movies about things.
3777000	3780000	But Dan, I watch exclusively sci-fi with you.
3780000	3783000	I don't make you watch anything you don't want to watch.
3783000	3784000	I like watching sci-fi.
3784000	3785000	I like watching all those things.
3785000	3787000	I am perfect.
3787000	3788000	You came back from the bathroom
3788000	3790000	and you looked that I was surfing through movies
3790000	3793000	that are about time travel and spaceships and lasers and stuff
3793000	3796000	and you went, huh, well, I guess you weren't that sorry,
3796000	3799000	as if I owed you because we had a fight and then we made up
3799000	3801000	and now I got to watch fucking Jason Siegel
3801000	3806000	and James Franco travel across the country together.
3806000	3808000	This is where we had the fight.
3808000	3811000	The fight started because I made a joke like,
3811000	3814000	oh, I thought I was going to turn on some romantic comedies.
3814000	3817000	Like, well, what do you want to Jason Siegel's Stephen Crut?
3817000	3820000	Like, as if those are the only movies I like.
3820000	3822000	I like romantic comedies.
3822000	3823000	Those guys make romantic comedies.
3823000	3826000	I watch every single romantic comedy.
3826000	3827000	Yeah.
3827000	3828000	Yeah, but like I know they're shitty.
3828000	3831000	Well, to reasons, I know that movies about octopus monsters
3831000	3833000	are shitty, but they're about something.
3833000	3836000	It's like there's always a guy no matter how bad the movie is.
3836000	3838000	Yeah, and I don't discourage you from watching them ever.
3838000	3840000	You did when you came out of the bathroom.
3840000	3841000	No, it was a fucking bit.
3841000	3842000	God damn it.
3842000	3843000	It was a bit.
3843000	3844000	It was a bit.
3844000	3845000	It was a bit.
3845000	3847000	You're a bit.
3847000	3848000	You're a human bit.
3848000	3849000	Yeah.
3849000	3851000	And I'm telling you, man, I'm just saying,
3851000	3854000	movies about people that fall in love and then fall out of love
3854000	3857000	and then fall in love again, it's like eating ketchup.
3857000	3858000	They're not fucking for you.
3858000	3861000	You can put that ketchup on a movie about an octopus monster.
3861000	3864000	You can have a guy invent an octopus monster
3864000	3866000	while he's falling in love with someone.
3866000	3868000	And you can have the octopus monster
3868000	3870000	be the reason they fall out of love.
3870000	3872000	And then they can fall back in love
3872000	3874000	because they beat the octopus monster.
3874000	3876000	It's ketchup.
3876000	3878000	The movies that are popular,
3878000	3881000	it's just fucking the mushrooms on top of the steak.
3881000	3882000	You're right.
3882000	3884000	If you only eat those, you'll die.
3884000	3885000	I'm not arguing here.
3885000	3887000	I watch all of those movies with you.
3887000	3889000	And the ancient Greeks didn't know.
3889000	3892000	You're the most high maintenance, difficult person on the planet.
3892000	3893000	I can't hear you right now.
3893000	3897000	I can't hear you because I have a bigger point to make,
3897000	3900000	which is that we have been telling stories
3900000	3902000	for 60,000 years.
3902000	3904000	Pull that number out of my ass.
3906000	3908000	Guys.
3908000	3909000	It doesn't matter.
3909000	3912000	You can play as many sound effects as you want.
3912000	3919000	We have been telling stories for 60,000 years.
3919000	3922000	If you drew that line on a piece of paper
3922000	3926000	and you illustrated the portion of it
3926000	3930000	that represented us telling stories about monsters eating people
3930000	3934000	and people beating them and people with weird shit in them,
3934000	3936000	there would be like 90% of it.
3936000	3940000	We only just now invented the idea that you can make a whole movie
3940000	3943000	about a dude being not into somebody.
3943000	3945000	It's fucking dumb.
3945000	3947000	Who cares if you're not into her?
3947000	3948000	Is that a movie?
3948000	3950000	Be not into her and have a robot.
3950000	3953000	Have a robot.
3953000	3955000	I'm angry.
3956000	3958000	I don't think you're wrong.
3958000	3959000	What about Deadly Friend?
3959000	3963000	That was about a guy, he liked a girl and she died
3963000	3965000	and then he turned her into a robot.
3965000	3966000	That's pretty cool.
3966000	3969000	We have to end this show.
3969000	3970000	Yeah.
3970000	3974000	Because it's become about a man in a woman's relationship.
3974000	3976000	So they hate it.
3976000	3980000	You know, if a fucking monster came up on stage right now,
3980000	3982000	they'd be like, I'm in this for three more hours.
3982000	3984000	Let me see six more of them.
3984000	3987000	There's no such thing as a series of romantic comedies
3987000	3989000	that goes to like 12 movies.
3989000	3992000	Jason Voorhees has been slashing people apart forever.
3992000	3995000	He's a crazy fucking guy that kills people.
3995000	3998000	He does it in space, does it in the 1800s.
3998000	4002000	Even the leprechaun can sustain a franchise
4002000	4005000	longer than a fucking guy and a girl going,
4005000	4007000	I don't know if I want to get married.
4007000	4009000	Dan, Daniel James Harmon.
4009000	4012000	I know before I was saying like,
4012000	4015000	look, I don't, this isn't about that and I like those movies
4015000	4017000	and I also like the movies you're like, you like,
4017000	4020000	but you've convinced me.
4020000	4024000	Perhaps we should not be together.
4024000	4026000	You've made it very clear.
4026000	4028000	You like monster movies.
4028000	4030000	I like blow jobs and making dinner.
4030000	4036000	So I think that perhaps we should part ways
4036000	4040000	and you should be with a woman that's better suited for you.
4040000	4041000	All right.
4041000	4045000	Thank you everyone for coming to our breakup show.
4045000	4047000	I guess that's how it ends.
4047000	4050000	Really quick, I'm always very vulnerable after relationships
4050000	4056000	and listen, this throat is super deep.
4056000	4058000	And I'll listen to you.
4058000	4060000	I have this problem where I just like listen to you
4060000	4062000	and I'm really interested in things.
4062000	4066000	I'm like really smart and stupid.
4066000	4069000	So if you want me to listen to you and talk to you for a while
4069000	4072000	and blow you and love you and care about you,
4072000	4074000	then I'm available.
4074000	4076000	I'm also, I know this is like, this is a big bummer,
4076000	4083000	but I'm not crazy or like emotionally dysfunctional,
4083000	4084000	I don't think so.
4084000	4086000	Okay. All right.
4086000	4089000	I'll be in the parking lot on my knees.
4089000	4094000	I'm just going to go down to my secret laboratory
4094000	4098000	and mourn the loss of our relationship.
4098000	4105000	Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
4105000	4106000	Computer.
4106000	4109000	Yes, Mr. Harmon.
4109000	4111000	Continue research project.
4111000	4116000	Omega Amadeus.
4116000	4118000	Omega Amadeus online.
4118000	4119000	Pretty fucking interesting.
4119000	4125000	Meanwhile, I'm on the parking lot.
4125000	4130000	All right.
4130000	4132000	I obey your command.
4132000	4136000	Omega Amadeus, seek out all female life forms
4136000	4138000	and annihilate them.
4138000	4139000	I am online.
4139000	4142000	I am programmed to comply.
4142000	4145000	Meanwhile, in the parking lot, your mother was shitty.
4145000	4147000	I'll be your mother.
4147000	4149000	I'll be there for you.
4149000	4151000	CG wall explodes.
4151000	4156000	Eliminate all women.
4156000	4158000	Cars exploding.
4158000	4160000	Meanwhile, in the parking lot, yes,
4160000	4164000	I have one of those weird squeezing vaginas.
4164000	4168000	So embarrassing, but it just squeezes and stimulates a penis
4168000	4172000	unlike any other vagina that's ever been.
4172000	4174000	Card door rips off.
4174000	4176000	Giant robot hand grabs your body,
4176000	4178000	lifts you into the air,
4178000	4182000	and Omega Amadeus looks at you with its gleaming red eye
4182000	4191000	and says, state your primary function or be exterminated.
4191000	4193000	Honestly, lover.
4193000	4197000	Oh.
4197000	4205000	Little tiny robot dick emerging from tiny hatch.
4205000	4208000	Just put it right here.
4208000	4212000	Affirmative.
4212000	4216000	It'll be okay.
4216000	4222000	Input acceptable.
4222000	4224000	Thank you, everybody.
4224000	4226000	All right.
4226000	4229000	Thank you for coming to a very special Harman Town.
4229000	4231000	Thanks for coming to Harman Town.
4231000	4234000	As in short bus special.
4234000	4237000	I'd like to thank some people.
