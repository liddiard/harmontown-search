0	9040	Good evening, Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
9040	12480	How is everybody doing tonight?
12480	14680	Hear ye, hear ye.
14680	16720	Harman Town is now in session.
16720	20360	Please, for your absolute delight and abject entertainment,
20360	25120	please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan
25120	25600	Harman.
30000	32480	And I'm stepping up the hill.
32480	34480	And I'm looking for a lover.
34480	35480	Thank you very much.
35480	37440	Looking, looking, I'm away.
37440	41480	Thank you, thank you.
41480	44960	I'd like to thank Jeff Davis for controlling again tonight.
44960	46960	Thank you, Jeff, for coming back.
46960	50240	And how about for those of you who were here and listened
50240	53080	to it, Erin McGathey as guest comptroller last week.
53080	55920	You guys are here as well.
55920	58640	She did all right.
58640	59400	It was adorable.
59400	60320	She had her moments.
60320	61000	It was adorable.
61000	62960	It was a different dynamic, most assuredly.
62960	64120	Oh, because we're not fucking.
64120	65440	Right.
65440	75040	I saw recently on Apple TV the gray
75040	77360	was on with Liam Neeson.
77360	79600	Liam Neeson fights wolves.
79600	80560	Anybody by applause?
80560	81800	Anybody has seen this movie?
84920	87400	Like a good eight to 10 people.
87400	89720	Yeah, I have not seen this movie.
89720	94480	Liam Neeson is a professional wolf hunter for a corporation.
94480	95400	He's on a plane.
95400	96720	It goes down.
96720	99840	He spends the rest of the movie with like nine guys that
99840	102440	slowly get picked off one by one by these wolves that
102440	103280	are around them.
103280	107320	I imagine the luck of being a wolf hunter.
107320	110680	And then they didn't go down in the water, thank God.
110680	112000	Or he would have been like, I don't
112000	115080	know what the fuck's going on.
115080	117000	No, he knew exactly what was going on.
117000	119240	And he wasn't very encouraging to the other people.
119240	122160	He was very informative about wolves.
122160	127080	And I've been talking like Liam Neeson about wolves
127080	129280	for the last two weeks, about everything.
129280	131880	When I'm making a sandwich, if somebody says,
131880	136120	is there mustard, I go, they don't give a fuck about mustard.
136120	138400	They're killing machines.
138400	141320	And if they've got cubs and we're within 150 yards of them,
141320	143400	we're already dead.
143400	145480	I have a question, because I've not seen this film.
145880	147800	What's your question?
147800	150560	Can I ask you, Liam Neeson, some questions about the movie
150560	151200	that you're in?
151200	154320	Your questions don't matter.
154320	158040	We're surrounded by biological killing machines.
158040	160920	But go ahead.
160920	163920	If you're a wolf hunter, how come everybody keeps dying?
167640	170320	I'm not a wolf hunter.
170320	173800	Wolves are the hunters.
173800	175200	They aren't hunted.
175240	177640	They don't give a fuck what we do.
177640	180640	They've been around for five billion more years than us.
180640	183320	They've got a mouthful of weapons.
183320	184440	They've got six legs.
188720	192880	The whole movie takes place in the Arctic, somewhere cold.
192880	193400	I'm sorry.
193400	195320	So they just keep walking and building fires,
195320	198320	and he keeps explaining how fucked they are.
198320	199760	And I really never watched the end,
199760	202120	because I know from the trailer that he glues glass
202120	205320	to his fists and faces off with what's probably the last wolf.
205320	206520	I didn't bother to.
206520	207600	I saw that in the trailer.
207600	210200	I just watched an hour and a half of him telling everyone
210200	214040	they're fucked, and that nothing they say matters.
214040	215960	In the first act, there's a guy that's like,
215960	219000	so what kind of wolves are these, man?
219000	221120	What, are they herbivores?
221120	222640	They eat nuts and berries?
222640	225800	They don't give a fuck about nuts and berries.
225800	227960	That's a real line from the movie.
227960	230840	The word fuck is in that movie more than anything,
230840	234120	more than a Scorsese film.
234120	237000	Everyone's saying fuck in ways that you never even
237000	238600	heard the word fuck used.
238600	240320	They're just past the fuck salt.
243320	245720	There is no fucking salt.
245720	250720	We're in a frozen sea surrounded by killers.
250720	253920	They've got a kill range of 300 kilometers.
253920	255920	We're in within half of that, and they've got cubs.
255920	258560	We're already dead.
258640	263440	How did the, I have questions about that.
263440	268680	I want, well, I don't want to see the movie.
268680	271600	The movie doesn't matter.
271600	275160	You think these things give a fuck what you watch on a screen?
275160	276520	They just want to eat your face.
279280	284160	They can see you 300% further than you can see them.
284160	286720	Their eyes are like microscopes and telescopes
286720	288960	taped to each other.
288960	292160	Their noses are sharper than their teeth.
292160	294520	Their noses are sharper than their teeth?
294520	297120	Yes.
297120	299640	Who would win in a fight, a bear or a wolf?
299640	301040	They don't fight.
301040	302600	They hunt.
302600	304600	Sorry, what was the rest of the question?
304600	306800	I got distracted by something I could dismiss.
311040	312840	I think wolf versus bear.
312840	314200	They're not wolves.
314200	316520	Oh, I'm sorry, they are.
316600	319080	Sorry, I got a jump the gun.
319080	321120	Our guns don't matter.
321120	322680	But I jumped them.
322680	324680	I can't verify it because I don't
324680	325880	think I've seen enough of the films
325880	328080	to know if you're doing a good Liam Neeson impression right
328080	328520	now or not.
328520	329520	I think it's pretty good.
329520	330520	It's pretty good.
330520	331160	Is it good?
331160	331840	I don't know.
331840	332320	Whoo!
332320	333800	Whoo!
333800	336320	Yeah, it's pretty early in the night for the audience
336320	338920	to be sarcastic.
338920	341040	Those of you who were here last week, I really,
341040	343000	I bet none of you were here last week,
343000	348840	because I went headlong for Inception's throat
348840	351920	like an angry wolf.
351920	357480	And you could feel the rift between me and the flock.
357480	360800	It just, Bo Peep almost got sheeped to death.
360800	364160	Well, see, I was listening to just the audio, the podcast
364160	364680	version of it.
364680	367560	I didn't sense that the audience was that disgruntled
367560	369120	by your hatred.
369120	369960	It's their faces.
369960	372080	You see their faces.
372080	375080	Just watch you at home that are listening on the podcast.
375080	376800	You won't be able to participate in this.
376800	381840	But just, Jeff, you focus on the, I don't know, Inception, eh,
381840	382720	it's kind of dumb.
385360	386080	So look at that guy.
386080	388080	Look at that guy.
388080	390080	He looks horrified.
390080	394640	But Harmontown is a plan that we have to form a colony.
394640	397600	Because I think we feel we don't want to be dire about this.
397600	401480	We don't feel like the world is ending terribly soon.
401480	403560	It's not a huge emergency.
403560	407800	But it takes a long time to start a city of people
407800	410320	who can carry humanity's torch.
410320	413960	So what we want to try to do, probably on the moon.
413960	415880	I keep thinking it's got to be on the moon.
415880	416760	Because I just don't know.
416760	419840	There's no place in Texas that's going to let us do this.
419840	421920	And I don't want to go anywhere where there's like mosquitoes.
421920	422760	They tried that once.
422760	424680	And the ATF came down pretty hard.
427320	427880	Yeah.
427880	428800	Don't groan it.
428800	431440	I mean, groan the government.
431560	433720	Bad for him to burn people alive.
433720	436720	It's a terrible, terrible way to govern.
436720	438400	I feel like it is too, actually.
438400	439920	We have to talk about religion.
439920	441360	We have to talk about politics.
441360	444640	We have to talk about what we would do with our unseemly
444640	445400	citizenry.
445400	448480	Like, what do you do if somebody does something you don't like?
448480	451280	It's going to happen in a room full of 200 people.
451280	454880	Like, you, sir, do something that nobody likes.
454880	456240	Fuck Batman.
456240	458240	Oh.
458240	459360	He said, fuck Batman.
459360	460000	I like that.
460000	460880	Now what do we do?
460880	464080	Now what do we do with him?
464080	466000	We fuck him.
466000	467760	An eye for an eye.
467760	469680	Fuck him?
469680	470480	You fuck Batman.
470480	472120	We fuck you.
472120	474800	It's not that hard, governments.
474800	475480	We figured it out.
475480	475840	That's it.
475840	476160	All right.
476160	476760	Now what do we do?
476760	477640	Let's play charades.
477640	482160	Also, a lot of my answer is, I'm just going to fuck you.
482160	483080	That was good.
483080	484080	Thank you for doing that.
484080	485480	It's not easy to be called upon.
485480	486640	I'm like a drowning man in a pool.
486640	487320	You don't have to applaud him.
487320	488000	That's ridiculous.
488000	489040	That was good.
489040	491960	You can if you want, but don't ever do anything here
491960	493440	that you feel compelled to do.
493440	494520	That's bad governing.
494520	495920	Did you not like the new Batman?
495920	496320	No.
496320	497280	I haven't seen it either.
497280	499320	I've given up on movies.
499320	501720	I don't even want to go to them anymore.
501720	502840	You didn't like the new Batman.
502840	504640	I haven't heard anything good about it.
504640	505560	It was silly.
505560	508520	Silly.
508520	509560	It's silly, he says.
509560	510760	We should give this guy an identity.
510760	511720	What's your name?
511720	512200	Max.
512200	512680	Max.
512680	514280	You should get a microphone, for fuck's sake.
514280	515720	Well, you can have one if you want.
515720	518320	Well, here's a Batman we can talk about,
518320	520520	because a lot of you people didn't even see it.
520520	522360	And the ones who did probably blocked it out.
522360	526120	Remember the Tommy Lee Jones two-face?
526120	529240	I was explaining this to my 27-year-old girlfriend today.
529240	533920	It was like explaining Korea or something.
533920	534840	She was going, what?
534840	536680	Come on.
536680	538560	Batman was sitting in the courtroom?
538560	539920	Wait, is this hanging out?
539920	541080	Because she started laughing.
541080	543160	We were actually watching the second Batman,
543160	545720	which everybody agrees is like, that's a pretty.
545720	548000	Well, it's certainly the best Batman movie
548000	549240	we've ever seen.
549240	551480	Were you saying it's like Korea, in that there's
551480	553520	North and South, that it's divided like two faces?
553520	555560	No, like a place.
555560	556680	No, no, no.
556680	560400	Down the middle of his face, there's the 38th parallel of.
560400	561400	No, I apologize.
561400	562760	I'm all over the place tonight.
562760	564600	I meant like I'm like an old veteran.
564600	566160	And I'm going, well, she's going,
566160	567680	what were you finding about Grandpa?
567680	570280	Well, we wanted to the Korea to be different.
570280	571880	Well, who gives a shit about Korea now?
571880	572600	I don't know.
572600	573600	We gave a shit back then.
573600	578960	What if the character of Two-Face
578960	580760	was actually a trenchant commentary
580760	581920	on the Korean conflict?
585400	587960	I don't remember which movie it was.
587960	590280	I think it was the Danny DeVito as the Penguin one.
590280	591760	I think it was still Michael Keaton
591760	595000	was Batman sitting in the courtroom in his Batman outfit.
595000	597160	And they show the origin of Two-Face
597160	599120	in the form of a newsreel.
599120	603120	And Tommy Lee Jones is questioning a mob guy.
603120	605080	And the mob guy doesn't like the way it's going.
605080	610200	So he pulls out, as they do, a jar of acid
610200	613840	from the pocket of his double-breasted suit coat.
613840	615080	You give a jar of pocket.
615080	621720	And he flings it at Tommy Lee Jones, who it's a visual thing.
621720	625920	I'll do what he did visually first.
625920	631480	He uses a manila folder to block exactly half his face.
631480	634880	And that's how he became Two-Face.
634880	637880	And he has a contentious relationship with Batman,
637880	642320	as Aaron Eckhart's Two-Face does with Christian Bale's Batman.
642320	644400	In this version, just because, well, where were you
644400	646260	when I got that acid on half of my face?
646260	648560	And the answer is, I was sitting there in the courtroom,
648560	651600	and I just couldn't get over the gallery thing.
651600	652880	They show a shot of Batman trying
652880	658760	to get over the courtroom, like people's court flappy door.
658760	660120	It couldn't be more ridiculous.
660120	664640	You'd have to show Batman taking a shit to ruin
664640	666680	the mythology more for nerds.
666680	669480	We just sat there in the theater and looked at Shrav.
669480	673840	And Shrav looked at me, and we just started making out.
673840	675600	I understand the appeal of Batman.
675600	677680	Somewhere in our heart, we want a guy
677680	680440	out there that's rich, which represents the fact
680440	682240	that America, it does work.
682240	684000	It's OK to be capitalist.
684000	685840	But we need a hero.
685840	688740	We need a Prometheus who uses his godlike powers
688740	692380	to uphold our value system.
692380	694340	But Max, you said the new one is silly.
694340	695540	Yes, it's a little silly.
695540	697340	They're not taking it seriously enough.
697340	699500	Well, maybe a little too serious.
699500	700020	Oh, OK.
703020	706980	You know what Liam Neeson would say about Batman?
706980	708900	Doesn't matter.
708900	711980	I'm determined that Liam Neeson pays off at some point tonight.
711980	713380	He probably will.
713380	714260	There's no payoff.
714940	716140	You're not going to get paid.
716140	717140	You're going to get eaten.
717140	718140	It's a weird crowd tonight.
718140	720140	I'm going to blame them.
720140	721140	I blame them.
721140	722700	I don't know what they did wrong.
722700	723860	I don't know what you guys paid.
723860	724860	I kind of blame myself.
724860	726860	I feel like I blew up my leaving town for one week,
726860	728940	and the continuity has just gone to shit.
728940	729740	They're expecting.
729740	732180	They're like, where's this show that I got all excited about
732180	735540	with a couple bitches at each other?
735540	738660	And then they bring other couples up and ruin.
738660	740260	I was out of town.
740260	743260	I hang out with Aaron and Dan quite a bit.
743260	744260	And I see them.
744260	749140	They have their little moments of cuddling and schmooby-schmoops.
749140	751340	And then they frequently have their moments
751340	753340	when you're at the great Greek having Greek food,
753340	755180	and they're fighting about the new improv idea
755180	756940	that we have for 40 minutes.
756940	760300	And it's an impenetrable, lonely place
760300	762300	to be sitting across the table from them.
762300	764220	And then I justify an exit, and I
764220	767020	have an Uzo with a guy named Nikos.
767020	768700	And I come back, and they're still talking
768700	769820	about the improv group.
769820	771500	And then one of them goes to the bathroom,
771580	773160	then one of them goes to the bathroom,
773160	774700	and I depose that person and say,
774700	778940	is this better or worse than being alone?
778940	781700	And then they pause for eight and a half seconds.
781700	784860	And in that pause, I leave and have another Uzo with Nikos.
784860	786580	And I come back, and there's no answer.
786580	788140	Then they come back, and you guys are making out,
788140	789940	and you guys look so happy together.
789940	791340	And then you probably go home and have
791340	792700	the worst sex of your lives.
795300	799820	Yeah, I have no qualification for that.
799820	802100	That's true.
802100	805980	So after that podcast, because there was a moment,
805980	807700	you guys are very self-revalatory.
807700	809620	And then what happened after that podcast?
809620	812180	Did you guys go home, and did you go to Baskin Robbins?
812180	817100	I got up Sunday, and did you go home and strangle each other?
817100	819100	It wasn't really revelatory.
819100	820580	I'm dating me now.
820580	825300	I'm dating myself with red hair.
825300	828380	I'm dating another person that's like me.
828380	829900	We don't balance each other out.
829900	832340	We just sink every boat that we step onto.
834980	838020	Because we just go straight to the asshole section,
838020	839780	which is only one seat there.
839780	840700	We sit on each other.
840700	842660	We argue about it as we sink.
845660	848940	They don't call the stern of the boat the asshole section.
848940	850900	But you know, who wants to die alone?
850900	852940	That sounds, you know.
852940	855100	Me.
855100	856460	See you at the finish line.
859340	861020	I don't know.
861020	862700	When I'm alone, I'm not alive.
862700	865740	I don't know that I exist when I'm alone.
865740	869140	I feel like there's a swarm of black CGI
869140	873140	insects eating my fucking skeleton from under my skin.
873140	876980	I feel like something wrong is happening.
876980	878380	That's when I'm feeling anything.
878380	880180	I just don't feel like I exist.
880180	884180	I'm a mouth with a brain on it, and two little legs
884180	887660	to walk it around and make people listen to my bullshit.
888660	891940	If I'm just walking around an empty house,
891940	894180	I can't talk to anybody.
894180	895100	I'm not alive.
895100	897820	You don't talk to yourself when you're at home?
897820	900700	I haven't had enough experience with it, but no.
900700	901420	I don't.
901420	904420	I'll maybe mutter something like, why is it there?
904420	904900	See?
907540	910060	Bathtub's not working.
910060	913540	How am I going to make the jets shoot up my ass?
913540	914740	I don't know.
914740	916380	Where did I put that mannequin leg?
918660	921540	Can't find it frickin' frickin' frickin' frickin' frickin'.
921540	923500	I just do Hanna-Barbera mumbles.
923500	925140	Frickin' frick.
925140	927660	I don't get it.
927660	930300	I don't get it either, but I know what I like.
930300	935060	I like a good woman to hate me.
935060	936540	No, we love each other.
936540	938140	Now we're going to get a big fight about,
938140	940500	Erin takes everything I say, not everything
940500	941540	I say very seriously.
941540	944380	Erin and I get in fights sometimes about, she doesn't,
945020	948660	she, I, when I'm.
948660	950380	For those of you listening in podcast land,
950380	955820	she's in row two, seat F. When I stand up here for an hour,
955820	957820	and I went, for those of you who are new here tonight,
957820	959820	in case you haven't figured this out, what I do on the show
959820	962820	is I stand up here for an hour and waste everyone's time.
962820	965300	While I'm doing that, I say whatever
965300	968500	I could possibly think to say to make you not get mad at me
968500	969980	and throw a rock at me.
969980	973540	So in scrambling to say things that get rocks not thrown at me,
973540	977340	I sometimes will say something that in the drive home,
977340	982940	Erin will go, so you like raspberries, huh?
982940	984100	I don't know, I don't know.
984100	986140	It just seemed like the funnier word to use.
986140	990020	Well, you know, raspberries, you know,
990020	991940	you called me that when you were mad at me.
991940	995180	That's a terrible example, I didn't, why didn't I?
995180	998420	Stupid, I'm the, is this the worst Harman time show ever?
998420	1000740	So far, OK.
1000740	1002100	Well, maybe we should talk about that.
1002980	1004740	Let's go where the energy is.
1004740	1005460	Let's wallow.
1005460	1008780	I can answer your job-related questions.
1008780	1011940	I can answer questions that you raise your hand and shout out.
1011940	1014900	I can arm wrestle one of you.
1014900	1017620	Or we could talk about the fact that the show sucks tonight,
1017620	1018740	since that's in the air.
1023740	1027660	We have a quorum, arm wrestle, arm wrestle in it.
1027660	1029860	Who wants to arm wrestle?
1029860	1030360	Get up here.
1030360	1030860	All right.
1032100	1033100	What is your name, sir?
1033100	1034100	It's BJ.
1034100	1048060	BJ, you have a, you have a, what could only be described as a fuchsia hat on.
1048060	1052460	I don't know what Renaissance fair you were recently expelled from,
1052460	1058740	but I'm glad you could take time out of your busy swashbuckling career to challenge.
1059640	1062360	You need like a big ostrich plume.
1062360	1063920	I think that would really put it over the edge.
1063920	1064920	Nice purse.
1064920	1066420	Nice purse.
1066420	1068920	He's getting heckled.
1068920	1073800	He doesn't deserve that, because for those of you listening in podcast form,
1073800	1082160	a guy came up to arm wrestle me that is already a better show just when he woke up
1082160	1087240	this morning than anything that I guess I have to do the Vince Colley check her
1087240	1088980	and play by play on this one.
1088980	1093500	Well, there's a man on stage right now wearing a smart little leather purse kind
1093500	1096900	of it's kind of like a Louis Vuitton kind of thing.
1096900	1099540	It's got a gold chain.
1099540	1100580	It's gold.
1100580	1101660	It's what?
1101660	1102420	It's gold.
1102420	1102940	It's gold.
1102940	1105060	He has a golden satchel.
1105060	1108900	He has a lady's scarf from from season four of the love boat.
1108900	1116100	So he has a he has a shirt that says a wicked lot of laughter, which I guess
1116240	1119120	you're from your recently in a Boston comedy festival.
1119120	1124320	I would imagine from that he's wearing a sky blue Crocs and I'm not fucking joking
1124320	1124920	podcast.
1124920	1127080	The man it's complicated.
1127080	1128040	He's got big hair.
1128040	1136760	He looks like John the Baptist from Rembrandt's decapitation and I'm really
1136760	1138360	going to throw a fucking wrench in this thing.
1138360	1140400	He's put his left hand up on the stool.
1140400	1141320	Oh, oh shit.
1141320	1143400	Yeah, this is we're going lefty on this one.
1143400	1144920	Are you lefty PJ?
1144920	1145540	No, you're not.
1148700	1154700	Have I taken time out of this yet to describe his turquoise Varnay ironic
1154700	1156780	glasses?
1156780	1158180	Believe me, I'm all for it.
1158180	1160900	This is fucking fantastic stuff.
1160900	1161940	Is anyone taking photos?
1161940	1164460	I want this on Instagram immediately.
1164460	1165980	All right, you call the go.
1165980	1170620	I'm going to I'm going to put my hand on top of both of your hands here to two
1170620	1174100	great competitors for a worthy cause when I take my hand off, I want you to begin
1174100	1177960	the first person to put somebody over the edge of the stool sets the tone for
1177960	1180680	the rest of what may be the worst or best time in town.
1180680	1181480	Okay.
1181480	1184360	And begin.
1184360	1188240	Okay, let's make it for 50 bucks.
1188240	1189560	He's kind of a stalemate.
1189560	1192960	He's purposely he's thinking I can't win because then I'm an enemy of the show,
1192960	1197000	but he's no, he's he's toying with trying to make it interesting.
1197000	1198200	He has a bracelet on between.
1198200	1200360	He went to a club last night or recently gave blood.
1200360	1202980	So maybe have I described?
1202980	1206340	He's got a fucking violet hat on a violet violet.
1206340	1208060	He looks like like Miss Marple.
1208060	1209740	No, what do you look like?
1209740	1210300	What do you look like?
1210300	1211340	He's just fucking with you.
1211340	1211660	I can't.
1211660	1213060	We're just finishing BJ.
1213060	1214100	Finish him.
1214100	1214600	Finish him.
1214600	1215100	BJ.
1223260	1224420	You're cheering over nothing.
1224420	1226660	You're still locked right at the top.
1226660	1228220	It's from the Eiffel fucking tower.
1228220	1228920	The imperative.
1230920	1234280	BJ, BJ, gold purse, gold purse.
1234280	1235800	Complicated outfit.
1237960	1238680	This is okay.
1238680	1239440	Oh my God.
1239440	1240080	Day three.
1243720	1245800	Dan took his scarf off.
1245800	1247920	Dan removed his scarf.
1247920	1250160	It's like Samson's hair.
1250160	1252000	Oh, he took his hat off.
1252000	1255520	Dan just put the guy's hat on his own head.
1255520	1256940	Now Dan looks like he's going to solve
1256940	1258260	a crime in Victorian England.
1261380	1261880	Jesus.
1261880	1263340	I propose we work together.
1263340	1264860	I propose we work together.
1264860	1265520	Work together.
1265520	1266020	He nodded.
1266020	1266520	He nodded.
1266520	1267020	He nodded.
1267020	1267520	It's a tie.
1267520	1268020	It's a fudge.
1268020	1268520	It's a tie.
1271520	1274700	Very noble of you, BJ.
1274700	1277020	Very noble of you.
1277020	1277620	See, you know what?
1277620	1280260	I mean, I guess on the moon, Harmon 10 is just
1280260	1282580	going to be a bunch of pussies who give up
1282580	1284460	in the middle of a fight.
1284480	1286760	When we get attacked by Mars, we're just going to go fuck it.
1286760	1288960	You guys, whatever you want.
1288960	1289720	BJ, everybody.
1289720	1291720	BJ.
1291720	1292360	Thank you, BJ.
1295520	1297720	Dan, I hate to tell you this.
1297720	1300320	He was never here.
1300320	1301680	We all just imagined that.
1301680	1302840	That is someone I'd invent.
1305800	1309880	But then Sony would go, make it grounded, will you?
1309880	1311160	That's how we'll settle disputes.
1311160	1313120	And it'll be easier on the moon because it's
1313340	1314860	gravity.
1314860	1317860	Jesus, we were both trying not to win, kind of.
1317860	1320420	Who do you think actually had, to be honest, who what?
1320420	1322060	Who do you think actually would have taken that one if it
1322060	1322580	had been like?
1322580	1326700	Anybody that's ever arm wrestled me would win.
1326700	1329180	I couldn't do a pull-up in grade school.
1329180	1332100	I was always like, did everybody go to grade schools
1332100	1335980	where they made you do pull-ups like the Jim Pops?
1335980	1336980	It's my imagination.
1336980	1338260	I don't want to insult you guys.
1338260	1341140	But I would like to think that everyone in a Harmon Town town
1341160	1345560	meeting is all of the people who couldn't do one pull-up.
1345560	1351760	And we want to prove that you don't need to.
1351760	1353680	What it should say in Latin on the flag
1353680	1355440	is our gym teacher was wrong.
1358520	1360160	People die of heart attacks every day.
1360160	1361440	Some of them were good at football.
1361440	1362440	Some of them weren't.
1362440	1367640	It has no bearing on lifespan, no tax bracket.
1367640	1369960	It's just some shit that we were doing back then
1369960	1374300	to just make everyone uncomfortable and kill time.
1374300	1377460	They should have let us play Dungeons and Dragons more.
1377460	1380580	I don't mean to bait you guys, but I'm
1380580	1383980	a little winded by that experience.
1383980	1387140	Ask me the most embarrassing thing in the world.
1387140	1389500	What's your favorite D&D character?
1389500	1391380	What's my favorite, like the one that I play?
1391380	1393460	What is your favorite?
1393460	1395660	Just to repeat in case we don't pick this up over podcasts,
1395660	1398780	what is Dan's favorite D&D character?
1398780	1401720	My character that I played was named Jim Nightblade.
1407720	1411080	And I was always partial to the throwing knife type,
1411080	1413200	the thief, the assassin.
1413200	1415600	Could you describe to me your dungeon master?
1415600	1416600	Did you have a good one?
1416600	1419720	Yes, Graham was the name of our dungeon master.
1419720	1422920	He's the greatest dungeon master that ever lives.
1422920	1425800	Because he was just insanely smart.
1425820	1430660	And Graham had hair down to his shoulders.
1430660	1431780	He never washed it.
1431780	1433900	And this was before Weezer, so it mattered.
1436620	1439840	He had these big, thick, brown frame glasses.
1439840	1443060	And he only had eight shirts, and they were all
1443060	1444820	from different state parks.
1444820	1448900	Because it was obvious that he had a kind of adventure
1448900	1450040	nature fixation.
1450040	1452940	I think his dad maybe just flew the coop.
1452940	1455300	And you pictured him out there climbing mountains
1455300	1456400	in sandals or something.
1456400	1459480	And he had all these t-shirts that
1459480	1463680	would have a howling wolf on them, and it would say Montana.
1463680	1465840	And then the next one, it would just say Alaska.
1465840	1467320	And there'd be two owls on a branch.
1467320	1468480	Those were all his t-shirts.
1468480	1472360	But they all had permanent sweat stains in the armpits.
1472360	1477500	And the kids in school, their whole four-year high school
1477500	1481280	experience was just the only thing that they got from Graham.
1481280	1485280	I got worlds that he created with his mind.
1485280	1488280	And had a whole birth as a human being,
1488280	1489440	courtesy of Graham.
1489440	1490860	For the rest of the high school kids,
1490860	1493360	they just figured out 90 ways to trick someone
1493360	1496120	into raising their arms so they could laugh at his.
1496120	1498320	They go, hey, where are the lights?
1498320	1500440	Where are the lights?
1500440	1502280	They're up there.
1502280	1503780	Look, there's a sweat stain in his armpit.
1503780	1506080	Yeah, god, when is that going to get tired?
1506080	1510480	But he carried a woman's briefcase everywhere he went.
1510480	1511320	Because it didn't.
1511320	1513820	BJ.
1513900	1517740	He fetishized Spock from old school, Star Trek.
1517740	1520860	Like, he really, as a lot of super nerds do,
1520860	1524420	they latch onto Spock or Data if they're younger.
1524420	1526220	Because it's logic.
1526220	1528940	Instead of all these trappings, all this shit
1528940	1529900	that makes no sense.
1529900	1531400	Like, can you dribble in basketball?
1531400	1533980	And why are you with no white pants after Labor Day,
1533980	1534940	or whatever the fuck?
1534940	1536860	This stuff, there's nothing logical about it.
1536860	1540580	So you escape into this idea that you're just pure brain.
1540580	1542020	And that's what Graham was.
1542620	1544340	He could have gotten a man's briefcase,
1544340	1545580	if he had wanted to.
1545580	1547580	But that wouldn't have been logical.
1547580	1549220	Why would he buy a man's briefcase
1549220	1551180	to appease some kind of weird?
1551180	1552680	So he just walked around with this like.
1552680	1553980	What was in the briefcase?
1553980	1555300	Dungeons and Dragons equipment.
1557700	1560500	And all of his perfect homework assignments
1560500	1563020	that he probably did on the bus with his mind
1563020	1565260	and a laser pencil.
1565260	1566460	Do we know where he is now?
1566460	1567820	Have you followed up with this guy?
1567820	1570540	He ended up going to MIT.
1570540	1572500	Either that or he was a pathological liar.
1572500	1574900	But he always wanted to go to MIT.
1574900	1576460	And I think he got accepted there.
1576460	1577940	And I never really saw him again.
1577940	1579140	Actually, I did.
1579140	1580540	I was in my 20s.
1580540	1582740	He came and hung out.
1582740	1584460	And he had a big tank of nitrous oxide
1584460	1588740	in the back of a pickup truck and a garbage bag.
1588740	1589740	And we just.
1589740	1591420	Maybe he was a dentist?
1591420	1598300	We just huffed nitrous all night out of a big, giant plastic
1598300	1601460	bag and talked about science.
1601460	1602980	And then he left again.
1602980	1605260	He was like Laszlo and real genius.
1605260	1606580	That's why I picture him.
1606580	1608940	That's a good image to have.
1608940	1611940	I don't know if he could pull off that beard.
1611940	1614700	But yeah, he was the greatest dungeon master in the world.
1614700	1617980	What makes you a good dungeon master?
1617980	1620220	You have to be the world's biggest nerd
1620220	1621980	and strangely arrogant about it.
1621980	1628280	You have to be so proud of how smart and logical
1629220	1629720	you are.
1629720	1632400	Didn't we try to play this as adults?
1632400	1634000	Yeah, I tried to dungeon master.
1634000	1634800	It was terrible.
1634800	1635440	It was terrible.
1635440	1636080	It was the worst.
1636080	1638320	You think you would be good at being a dungeon master?
1638320	1639360	You're an arrogant nerd.
1639360	1640040	Yeah, I am.
1640040	1642480	But not arrogant enough.
1642480	1645080	Just I don't know.
1645080	1647360	Maybe I spoke too much pot in my life or something.
1647360	1648280	I don't know what it is.
1648280	1649080	I'm not good at it.
1649080	1651160	I worry too much about what people think about me.
1651160	1652080	That's what it is.
1652080	1653360	You can't be a good dungeon master
1653360	1656520	if you're worried about doing a good job as a dungeon master.
1656520	1658600	Did everybody got that?
1658600	1660440	Anybody else have another question?
1660440	1662680	You want something embarrassing again?
1662680	1664360	Yeah, try to dig deep, man.
1664360	1664860	Fucking.
1664860	1665880	Trying to embarrass you.
1665880	1667880	Yeah, make this a memorable night
1667880	1669320	so that when you walk out of here,
1669320	1671440	you don't go, oh, I was at the shitty Harman town.
1671440	1675080	You go, oh, I was at the one where fucking pedophile tried
1675080	1678040	to attack Dan.
1678040	1680360	And then they wrestled each other to the ground.
1680360	1682160	And then he took off the pedophile's mask.
1682160	1682920	He wasn't a pedophile.
1682920	1685680	He just had a purple hat on.
1686560	1687160	Sorry, BJ.
1687160	1688320	I wasn't referring to you.
1688320	1689400	Wow.
1689400	1691440	Jesus.
1691440	1692280	Terrible.
1692280	1693760	I saw a hand shoot up over there.
1693760	1694680	That was BJ waving.
1694680	1695180	OK.
1698480	1698960	Anybody?
1698960	1700160	I'm not an underage child, BJ.
1700160	1700680	Stop waving.
1700680	1701920	I got one back there, yes?
1701920	1704880	What's the most embarrassing thing you did as a kid?
1704880	1707200	Embarrassing thing you've done as a kid.
1707200	1710720	Aside from constantly shitting my pants, just constantly.
1710720	1712480	What do you mean, constantly shitting your pants?
1712480	1715440	Just all the time, just always pooping my pants.
1716320	1717480	Is that a medical condition?
1717480	1717880	Is that a thing?
1717880	1719960	I don't know.
1719960	1721520	I didn't like to go to the bathroom.
1724400	1726280	There's your problem.
1726280	1728000	You know, when you're a kid, I don't know.
1728000	1729720	I'm not going to try to put this off on you guys
1729720	1731280	if you don't have a similar experience.
1731280	1735080	But when you're a kid, and you're just learning to poop,
1735080	1741880	but you're also learning to read, learning to poop.
1741880	1744000	And sometimes you're sitting there reading a book.
1744320	1746200	I used to sit cross-legged on the floor.
1746200	1746880	I'd be reading a book.
1746880	1749320	And then I'd feel like, ah, I got to take a shit.
1749320	1751200	Get up.
1751200	1751760	Get up.
1751760	1752840	It's Asimov.
1752840	1753840	I'm not going to get up.
1753840	1756800	I want to finish reading I, Robot.
1756800	1757400	It's amazing.
1757400	1759320	You're still going to be seated when you read.
1759320	1760280	I didn't get that part.
1760280	1761320	I didn't understand that.
1761320	1763280	I just would shit my pants.
1763280	1764840	You're saying you were that into that book,
1764840	1765960	or you were that lazy?
1765960	1766720	Or what's that?
1766720	1769160	I don't, I can't, I can't, I totally.
1769160	1771000	Maybe you just have a weird thought.
1771000	1772400	Maybe I have less muscle control.
1772400	1773000	I don't know.
1773200	1774320	Kids shit their pants, man.
1774320	1777360	You're acting like they don't, and they do.
1777360	1779040	Kids shit their pants.
1779040	1782600	I'm not just playing the foil to you right now.
1782600	1786840	I've never heard of anyone that constantly shit their pants.
1786840	1791160	Old people, not little people.
1791160	1794640	Do you remember when we had Adam come up and read
1794640	1796720	that email from my brother, remember that?
1796720	1800400	And he referred to a story that my mom told
1800400	1802720	about how they used to put me in a closet when I was a kid.
1803080	1804600	Was it with books?
1804600	1807160	That's a reference to, when I was in kindergarten,
1807160	1808840	I already knew how to read.
1808840	1811200	And they wanted to know how well I could read.
1811200	1813240	Because I came into kindergarten, I can read.
1813240	1815520	So they would, this was in the 70s,
1815520	1818600	it wasn't politically incorrect to track kids and stuff.
1818600	1821120	They wanted to know who's smart, who's dumb,
1821120	1824440	how smart are you, how smart can you be, and all this stuff.
1824440	1826760	We later realized that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.
1826760	1830200	But back then in the 70s, it was the Wild West.
1830200	1832640	Everyone was looking for a meteor man.
1833480	1836320	And I could read, so they would take me.
1837320	1840120	This lady, Miss Piana, would come and she would get me.
1840120	1841960	All the kids would start playing with blocks and stuff.
1841960	1846280	And then this beautiful, I remember it was beautiful
1846280	1849880	and tall, but it was probably the third woman I'd ever seen.
1849880	1851520	And I was two feet tall, so.
1852520	1854800	And she would take me to this closet.
1854800	1857240	It was like a storage closet filled with all these books
1857240	1859160	and overhead projectors and stuff.
1859160	1861800	And then it's not like they could devote resources to that.
1861800	1863320	So they would just sit.
1863320	1864640	So she would put a book in front of me
1864640	1866040	and she'd go read this chapter
1866040	1867480	and then answer the questions at the end of it.
1867480	1868320	Give me a piece of paper.
1868320	1870280	She would separate you from the rest of the kids.
1870280	1871280	Put you in a room.
1871280	1872600	It turned out to be a great idea.
1872600	1874920	Like the Count of Money Cristo in there.
1874920	1875760	Yeah, yeah.
1875760	1877200	So the kids loved me for it.
1877200	1879080	It was great, because I would come back to recess
1879080	1882680	and they'd be like, oh, it's our hero.
1882680	1885480	It's the, please, please.
1885480	1886720	We were just learning football.
1886720	1888320	Let us catch you up on things.
1888320	1890920	No, it was, I'm not complaining.
1891800	1893320	I got to read a lot of dumb shit
1893320	1895800	about nothing I can remember.
1895800	1897880	But they would go, okay, and then fill out this thing
1897880	1898720	after you finish reading it.
1898720	1900000	But then she'd take off.
1900000	1902760	So that just reminded me of that thing,
1902760	1905280	because I had to pee really bad.
1905280	1906520	But I was in kindergarten.
1906520	1908400	I never had gone pee without somebody
1908400	1909840	helping me go pee before.
1909840	1913040	And so she told me, when the bell rings,
1913040	1913920	you can go to lunch.
1913920	1916120	And for some reason, I knew what that meant,
1916120	1917560	that I would be able to get up out of the chair
1917560	1918400	and go to lunch.
1918400	1919400	But she never came back.
1919400	1921160	And I had to pee really bad.
1921160	1922800	And I couldn't tell time.
1922800	1925000	So I just knew I was waiting for this bell to ring
1925000	1926120	so I could get up and go to lunch.
1926120	1929080	And then maybe I could get someone to help me pee.
1929080	1931480	But I just stared at this clock.
1931480	1932320	And I never knew.
1932320	1933800	And then I was just like, you know,
1933800	1936160	if you've ever tried to hold your pee,
1936160	1937400	and then when you're a little kid,
1937400	1938560	you're a little bladder
1938560	1940400	and it hasn't fought any dragons yet, you know?
1940400	1945040	You haven't gone to any frat parties or anything.
1945040	1946680	It's just a little muscle.
1946680	1948400	It's like trying to hold in
1948400	1950120	all those Flintstones vitamins and things.
1950120	1955120	And so I just stared at this mysterious circular dial.
1955880	1957400	And then the bell never rang.
1957400	1960800	So then I was just like, all right, here goes nothing.
1960800	1963280	And I just pissed myself.
1964240	1966960	And as I was pissing, I got, I don't know if it's,
1966960	1968360	yeah, yeah.
1968360	1969440	I don't know if it's the same for women,
1969440	1971080	but once you start, you can't, you can't just,
1971080	1973640	it's not like a, you know, it's not like a valve.
1973640	1974480	It's like-
1974480	1975320	It's like Pringles.
1975320	1976960	It's like Pringles.
1976960	1978160	It's a lot like Pringles.
1979000	1980320	Once you pop.
1980320	1981160	Yeah.
1982080	1985520	So yeah, at the apex of me relieving myself
1985520	1989320	in my little ashkash bhagash overalls
1989320	1994320	with a little iron on D on the front of them, for real,
1994320	1995720	which I called my D pants.
1995720	1997920	My mom made them out of red denim
1997920	2002920	and they had a little blue sunflower, cornflower blue D
2004160	2005880	and I called them my D pants.
2005880	2008040	And I always wanted to wear them.
2008760	2010240	These are what I'm pissing in
2010240	2012600	and the bell's ringing while I'm,
2012600	2014240	and so now the bell ranks and now I can leave.
2014240	2015680	So I just remember getting up
2015680	2017480	and just looking back at this chair
2017480	2019040	in the middle of a storage closet
2019040	2021360	with a big puddle of piss around it.
2021360	2023520	And I'm kind of going like, well, fuck her.
2024600	2025480	Clean it up.
2025480	2026740	Clean up your mess.
2028320	2029680	And then I went downstairs to lunch
2029680	2032240	and for some reason I thought that
2032240	2034220	because it was in my pants,
2035240	2037760	I thought that the semantics of peeing in your pants
2038360	2041280	somehow applied to the privacy and the containment.
2041280	2044680	I didn't understand yet that it's darker
2044680	2046520	where all the pee is.
2046520	2049480	And it looks like I just rode a horse made of spray paint.
2051640	2053240	So I'm just down in the lunch line
2053240	2055800	and I'm wearing my little red denim pants
2055800	2060080	and I just have a black fucking saddle,
2060080	2061520	whatever you'd call that.
2061520	2063080	And I remember my brother was down there,
2063080	2064640	my big brother was five years older.
2065440	2068280	My brother, it's important to have a big brother.
2068280	2070800	They can stick up for you to bullies and stuff like that.
2070800	2072760	So I came down to the lunch line
2072760	2074080	and my brother looked and went like,
2074080	2077280	Jesus Christ, did you piss your fucking pants?
2077280	2079440	And all the sixth graders were like, holy shit, he did.
2079440	2081160	They were actually more embarrassed for me than my brother
2081160	2083440	and my brother wanted to talk it out a little more.
2084940	2087960	Were you there at the Price is Right
2087960	2089280	when the woman Peter pants?
2089280	2090120	You weren't there, right?
2090120	2091520	No, doesn't that happen every week?
2091520	2095120	Well, we're both friends with Drew Carey
2095120	2097200	and he just got the job and I went to go see,
2097200	2099160	we haven't talked about this in the show before, have we?
2099160	2100760	God damn it, it was so good.
2100760	2102160	I went to go see Drew and he's like,
2102160	2104200	hey, come on down to Price is Right.
2104200	2105480	I really love doing this job, it's really fun.
2105480	2106640	Come down and I'm hosting this thing.
2106640	2109000	It's like big rock concerts, great.
2109000	2110080	Keep talking, I'm gonna get a drink.
2110080	2111640	All right, Dan's gonna make a drink.
2111640	2112760	But you're right there in the thick of it
2112760	2113600	and it's pretty exciting.
2113600	2116360	And if anyone's ever been to a taping event,
2116360	2118760	it's like going to like a Beatles concert.
2118760	2121480	People are so happy and so, people are screaming.
2121480	2122760	It's really delightful.
2122760	2125080	And you got the little Yodel-y guy that goes up the thing.
2125080	2126680	Oh, God damn it, I love that fucker.
2126680	2129320	Yeah, Dan was there like kind of bashful,
2129320	2131520	like when you're getting your Plinko chips
2131520	2133760	and you're like, does the kitty liver cost $35?
2133760	2136080	It costs $25 and Dan's like, it's gonna cost $35.
2136080	2136920	That's the kitty litter.
2136920	2138360	I buy the same kitty litter.
2138360	2139640	I'm like, yell it out.
2139640	2141520	And Dan's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2141520	2142720	She's looking at the audience like,
2142720	2144360	you have the same kitty litter, yell it.
2144360	2145960	Hey, I don't know, I don't know.
2145960	2146960	You got really nervous about it.
2147760	2149760	$35, $35.
2149760	2152240	And she gets it right and it's like, it's exciting as shit.
2152240	2156120	So there's a woman that gets up there and she, I don't know,
2156120	2160360	I would maybe put her at 40-ish and probably a couple kids
2160360	2162840	and just a nice lady got a little mom jeans on,
2162840	2164480	a little blouse and she comes up and she's down
2164480	2166680	in contestants row and I'm sitting right behind her.
2166680	2169480	And I'm sitting with a bunch of Marines.
2169480	2173280	And this woman, she's one of the first people called down.
2173280	2175720	She's there from the very beginning.
2175960	2178200	And from the get-go, she's losing her mind,
2178200	2180840	but she's also holding her crotch in the pee-pee dance
2180840	2181920	fashion.
2181920	2183800	So she's doing like that, like she's happy as can be,
2183800	2188760	but she's holding her pussy.
2188760	2191880	Like a little baby holds your crotch when you try to,
2191880	2194880	you think that that can stop the flow and it can't,
2194880	2195720	but you do your best.
2195720	2197160	It's, you know, mind of her matter.
2197160	2198440	And she's just smiling and having,
2198440	2200120	she overbids on the washer and dryer
2200120	2201440	and then they go up and do that.
2201440	2203600	Then she overbids, they're underbids on the pool table
2203600	2205200	and then they go to commercial and she's still there.
2205440	2208240	And she now is like, every time she's still so happy to be
2208240	2210320	up there, but now she's holding on for dear life
2210320	2211360	and front and back.
2211360	2213840	So one around the front, one around the back.
2213840	2216280	She's worried that it's like whack-a-mole, that it's a.
2219520	2223920	So the best game in the Price is Right universe
2223920	2225000	is of course Plinko.
2225000	2228800	And when you, when Plinko comes out, it's like,
2228800	2230880	it's bedlam, people go mad.
2230880	2233880	And she, and, well, first of all, you don't know,
2233880	2235800	she bids, she wins, she comes up on stage,
2235800	2237800	the curtain goes up, it's Plinko.
2237800	2242400	And at that moment, when she had come up on stage,
2243280	2245840	I could see the little saddle of the spray paint horse,
2245840	2247160	Peepee, staying on the thing.
2247160	2250360	She had wet herself and she was still holding
2250360	2251200	on to herself.
2251200	2252280	She had let a little go.
2253280	2256000	And the whole audience is like, ah, Plinko, whoa.
2258400	2259480	No, sorry, she gets up on stage,
2259480	2260440	she's one of the things she hugs through.
2260440	2263200	We see the pee, I'm now bracing two Marines.
2264040	2266160	It's like we're closing ranks.
2267120	2269840	And then the Drew can't see it.
2269840	2271960	The whole audience can see that she's pissed herself
2271960	2273080	a little bit.
2273080	2275160	Then the curtain goes up and Plinko comes out
2275160	2276520	and then it's fucking over.
2278920	2282080	She's now, but she's like, she just doesn't care.
2282080	2284960	Jumping about, she's just as happy as can be.
2284960	2287680	And she's peed herself in the whole audience just like,
2287680	2289520	because you put yourself up on stage and like,
2289520	2294520	oh baby, you're on camera, like your family.
2294520	2295600	But she just doesn't care.
2295600	2297520	So she becomes everybody's hero.
2299040	2302120	And I believe you get five little chips, right?
2302120	2304680	You get one for free and then you get four bid prices
2304680	2305600	and things like that.
2305600	2306440	And she gets them all.
2306440	2307280	She just nails them.
2307280	2308960	That's 12, that's 14, that's 38.
2308960	2310920	She just nails the clock radio.
2310920	2312240	And she's got all of her chips.
2312240	2313800	And only at that moment,
2313800	2316800	cause Drew Carey has to follow her up the staircase
2317800	2320480	to ascend the heights of the Plinko.
2320480	2322600	So that's what, that Drew's the last one to know.
2322600	2323560	Yeah, Drew's the last one to know.
2323560	2326600	Cause Drew's only been hosting the show for a few months
2326600	2329160	and he's kind of seen a lot of stuff go down.
2329160	2331680	But clearly there's some other free song in the air.
2331680	2332520	It's like something else.
2332520	2333960	He's just going, why is this woman so focused
2333960	2335400	and clear headed?
2335400	2338720	And, it's as if she doesn't have anything
2338720	2342400	left to care about other than getting prices right.
2342400	2345680	So the audience is in some weird kind of just like,
2345720	2348680	we're all just holding on to each other.
2348680	2351360	And we're just like, we just don't want her to be embarrassed.
2351360	2354480	We don't want to see a woman realize what's going on
2354480	2355680	and run off the stage.
2355680	2358480	And we just don't want to see something terrible happen.
2358480	2362160	So she gets up on stage and she beats Plinko's dick
2362160	2363600	all around the fucking room.
2364480	2367600	It's just fucking 10,000, 5,000, 10,000, 2,000.
2367600	2368800	She just lights it up.
2368800	2372520	And she won, I think the second most money in Plinko history.
2372520	2374480	And Drew was the last person up the stairs
2374480	2378000	and he finally figured out what was going on in the room.
2378000	2379840	And he goes, all right, so and so and so,
2379840	2381480	go up the stairs, oh boy.
2381480	2386160	Because he was absolutely eye level with her pants.
2387080	2389520	And he goes, okay, let's just get you up here
2389520	2391080	and facing the other direction.
2391080	2392400	And I'm like, he got it.
2392400	2393840	And they took her backstage.
2393840	2395320	I don't know if they gave her a new pair of pants
2395320	2397520	or they gave her a hair dryer.
2397520	2400000	But she came out, she won the fucking showcase showdown
2400000	2402280	and the entire building was chanting her name.
2403280	2406080	Because yeah, and I wish I could remember.
2406080	2407080	I wouldn't repeat it.
2408080	2410400	But God fucking bless you for peeing your pants
2410400	2411520	and not caring.
2411520	2412360	That's cruel.
2413320	2414440	None of us would do it.
2414440	2415640	None of us would do it.
2415640	2417240	All right.
2417240	2419840	What is your advice, writes an audience member,
2419840	2422320	for screenwriters looking to get into writing for TV?
2422320	2425960	Obviously, I'm the last person you should be asking.
2425960	2428040	That's not true, because you have shows.
2428040	2428880	Well, I got it.
2428880	2429840	I remember what I did.
2429840	2433080	Yeah, just don't do what I did afterward.
2433080	2436160	How do you get into, don't, I swear to God,
2436160	2438360	this is gonna sound like a glib jaded thing,
2438360	2440520	but I swear to God, it's my honest answer.
2440520	2444080	It's not a jaded cynical thing, like it's gonna sound.
2444080	2449080	Don't have an idea that much.
2450160	2452920	Community wasn't, it's just cheers.
2452920	2453760	It's just taxes.
2453760	2455960	TV is not, we're not going to a sitcom
2455960	2460720	to have our minds blown by the concept of the sitcom.
2460720	2462200	That's my best advice for TV,
2462200	2463960	because I think too many people make that mistake.
2463960	2467120	Science fiction, maybe, if you want to do a sci-fi drama,
2467120	2469640	then maybe what's drawing people in.
2469640	2472080	I haven't, I've never written that stuff
2472080	2474000	or pitched that stuff to anybody, so.
2474000	2476080	But you're about to go back into the market potentially
2476080	2478160	and write another half hour show, right?
2478160	2480280	Yeah, I'm closing some deals.
2481280	2483160	But do you have ideas, or are you gonna?
2483160	2484680	No, absolutely not.
2484720	2488560	And I would be a bad sitcom writer if I had any ideas.
2488560	2490840	My ideas start, because the system,
2493040	2494400	it's got its own momentum,
2494400	2497400	and the tough thing for TV writers to learn
2497400	2500320	is that you wanna, yeah, it's really important
2500320	2501640	to be super talented.
2501640	2504200	That's fantastic if you can manage that.
2504200	2508080	But what you really need to do is like understand
2508080	2510000	that everyone wants to help,
2510000	2512040	and they're all getting paid a lot of money to help.
2512040	2515360	So just work less and think less.
2515360	2519160	You're going to be just as talented a writer
2519160	2521680	whether you think a long time
2521680	2524160	about what you wanna write or not.
2524160	2528040	What you're being paid to do is be smart on paper
2528040	2531440	and the execution of a script, but they wanna say.
2531440	2532840	Could he work at a pickle store?
2532840	2535000	Just say yes, yes.
2535000	2537640	The answer is yes, he could work at a pickle store.
2537640	2540280	Because then aliens can still invade the pickle store
2540280	2541840	in episode five, it doesn't matter.
2542280	2543520	If you wanna get fired later,
2543520	2545040	you can figure out how to do it.
2546400	2550680	My boss stomps all over my soul furiously and regularly.
2550680	2551680	Is it Maxigan?
2553160	2556120	How do I get paid more for enduring that?
2557200	2558840	I think this person's baiting me.
2563920	2567280	I got a book on tape at an airport.
2567280	2569000	Something about lion taming.
2570000	2575000	A guy that tamed lions wrote a book for CEOs or something.
2575000	2576800	He was writing a book, but it was all about,
2576800	2578800	I listened to it for a while, it was kind of interesting.
2578800	2582280	He was talking about basically how to make assholes think
2582280	2585320	that doing what you want is their idea.
2585320	2586640	Because that's what a lion tamer does.
2586640	2590480	Obviously lions can rip your head off if they want to.
2590480	2593480	But what lion tamers are doing is convincing the lion
2593480	2594880	that for instance when they stand
2594880	2596840	on those stupid little pedestals,
2597600	2600560	the lion thinks that it's defending the pedestal.
2600560	2602680	It thinks that it's pedestal
2602680	2605600	and that the lion tamer really wishes it could be up there.
2605600	2607440	And the lion's going like,
2607440	2610760	stay away from my shitty little bongo drum
2610760	2612400	that you left standing on.
2612400	2615240	And the audience is going, what a dumbass lion.
2615240	2616960	The lion is really proud of itself.
2618760	2620520	The answer to the question is,
2620520	2623240	somehow you have to trick your dipshit boss
2623240	2626280	into thinking that he would be even dumber
2626280	2628040	for not paying you more.
2628040	2629000	I don't know how to do that,
2629000	2632280	otherwise I would have picked a better job than I picked.
2632280	2635080	I don't have any bosses, and as soon as I do,
2635080	2638160	I get three years before they're all over my ass
2638160	2639360	and fire me.
2639360	2640920	I don't want to sound like a broken record,
2640920	2641920	but I got fired.
2641920	2646120	What do you think, I mean,
2646120	2647840	this might be beating a dead horse,
2647840	2651240	but what do you think their justification is for firing?
2651240	2652200	What would they say?
2653200	2655640	Sorry, what was the question?
2655640	2658360	What would they, not their press release answer,
2658360	2660760	but why do you think they fired you?
2660760	2664640	Oh, it's cost benefit ratio.
2664640	2669640	NBC moved the show to Friday night at 8.30,
2670000	2671920	and said only 13 episodes.
2671920	2675160	So that's NBC saying, you're basically almost canceled.
2675160	2677160	We're just, we're about to cancel you.
2677160	2679720	So what is Sony gonna do with that clock,
2679720	2680800	with that shot clock?
2680800	2683160	They're not gonna give the ball to psycho pants.
2683160	2686880	Like, I don't, what am I gonna do with 13 episodes?
2686880	2690800	It's not gonna be the thing that makes starting NBC go,
2690800	2693520	oh shit, we had you wrong.
2693520	2697280	Get this guy back at 8, put him at 9.30 on Thursday.
2697280	2698320	This guy's the best.
2698320	2701560	If your motivation is like to get a show running
2701560	2703760	and syndicated and as long as possible,
2703760	2708760	you definitely, it's not a dumb decision to bid me ado.
2709640	2712760	It was just, it's a boring answer.
2712760	2715280	I'm just an asshole that does it.
2715280	2716840	I don't take notes very well.
2716840	2719520	I don't like, you could give me five notes
2719520	2721560	and if one of them was what I was gonna do already,
2721560	2723520	I'll say that's a good idea.
2723520	2726520	But it doesn't, it only fools them for three seasons.
2728080	2730840	Will drugs be allowed in Harmon Town?
2730840	2732040	Yes, of course.
2735640	2737840	Would there be some drugs that you would not allow?
2739000	2741160	No, no, there can't be, honestly,
2741160	2743360	we have a big problem in this country right now
2743360	2746680	with momentum, we are all freaked out
2746680	2750440	because we go, oh shit, if you legalize this tomorrow,
2750440	2752540	whether it's a certain kind of gun and we all,
2752540	2753900	all this stuff makes perfect sense,
2753900	2755840	but it's only given the situation that we have.
2755840	2757320	That's why we have to start over.
2757320	2759760	Because the truth is, hand grenades should be able
2759760	2762480	to grow on trees, but we should have self-control.
2762480	2765320	Like, we can't, because what if some guy
2765320	2767800	just in his garage invents tomorrow,
2767800	2770820	just invents a laser wand that if you touch people
2770820	2773760	with it, they just, their body just disappears.
2773760	2776720	Is, does that guy get to be the most successful person
2776720	2778720	in the world because he invented that?
2778720	2781000	Because he can't be prosecuted for his crimes,
2781000	2783480	he can't be, he's just gonna go up to people,
2783480	2785080	you don't have any evidence to convict him.
2785080	2787080	Like, the mailman comes over and he goes, fuck you,
2787080	2790920	I don't like your cheekbones and he makes him disappear.
2790920	2793680	Is, does that guy get to be president?
2793680	2798160	Or is it wrong to hurt people and make them dead?
2798160	2801240	It's obviously the latter, it's wrong to hurt people.
2801240	2804440	We have to remember that that's really the star
2804440	2807840	we're pursuing here, not, we can't get too hung up
2807840	2810240	in how to make nobody hurt anybody.
2811400	2813760	I told the story, I never told it again
2813760	2815720	because we did record it and I'd like to put it
2815720	2818040	on the website, but it's an old classic.
2818040	2821360	It's my origin story, the story of how my dad
2821360	2823760	beat the living fuck out of me and my brother
2823760	2824800	for playing with matches.
2824800	2827320	It's really my, it's my radioactive spider
2829240	2831440	because it explains almost everything I can think of
2831440	2835440	about my, me as I am.
2835440	2838560	So my brother and I got caught playing with matches.
2838560	2841080	My brother loved setting stuff on fire,
2841080	2844400	he's fascinated with fire and he was five years older than me
2844400	2847280	so we went out in the back bushes and we gathered
2847280	2848960	some dry leaves and he had a book of matches
2848960	2850520	and we were lighting little piles of twigs
2850520	2854360	and stuff on fire and my mom came looking for us
2855440	2857160	and she caught us playing with matches.
2857160	2862160	So for this offense, as with all major ones,
2862800	2865800	the misdemeanor was always the wooden spoon.
2865800	2867400	My mom could handle that, she had a big bag
2867400	2869880	of wooden spoons because they would break on your ass
2869880	2872000	to just hit you, got a lot of wooden spoon people
2872000	2875680	in the audience, I can hear you, I can feel you.
2876560	2879400	For the felony offenses, like playing with matches,
2879400	2882560	big deals, it was wait till your father gets home
2883560	2886240	and my dad didn't get home until like 9 p.m. usually.
2886240	2889480	He was a very hard worker and a lot of his job
2889480	2892760	seemed to involve some Southern comfort.
2896280	2897880	You don't mean porch swings.
2897880	2902640	And so it's wait till your dad gets home,
2902640	2904200	you got caught playing with matches.
2904200	2907720	I'm telling you, this is gonna be really bad, says mom.
2909240	2911960	My brother's freaked out, he didn't usually freak out
2911960	2915840	very easily, this is a guy who once crawled out
2915840	2917880	the bedroom window in his Spiderman pajamas
2917880	2919240	just to go fight crime.
2921360	2923120	I admired his moxie.
2925200	2929040	He didn't seem to be afraid of much but he certainly,
2929040	2930800	he knew that we were in for it.
2930800	2934040	My mom took me aside and said,
2934040	2937400	Daniel, you know those little stories you like to write?
2937400	2939960	Because I did like to write the little things and go,
2939960	2943840	now Dan Harmon and the Fabulous Time Tunnel
2943840	2948080	by Dan Harmon, like just be scrawling,
2948080	2951520	like just write on typing paper and staple them together.
2951520	2953880	I wrote a book, pay attention to me.
2956200	2959640	Once upon a time there was a bear in the bathtub.
2960960	2965160	La la la, Pulitzer please, I'm precocious.
2967920	2969120	My mom goes,
2972800	2975560	I want you to write one of your stories for me
2975560	2978000	while you wait for your dad to get home.
2978000	2980400	I want you to write me a story about a little boy
2980400	2984420	that gets caught playing with matches and regrets it.
2985440	2988000	Was she not terrified for your safety?
2988000	2989680	She was like, we need to mitigate the beating
2989720	2991160	that's about to go on.
2991160	2993240	I feel like part of her was going,
2993240	2995720	let's not lose the lesson.
2995720	2998600	But I think most of her was going like,
2998600	3000120	I want to fuck with you.
3000120	3004280	I am basically the bad guy from Tango and Cash right now.
3004280	3008320	I want to just kind of psychologically, I don't know.
3008320	3009440	My mom's gonna listen to this and go,
3009440	3011160	that's not what I was doing.
3011160	3012680	You're so old, how do you know?
3013880	3014720	I didn't know what you did.
3014720	3016440	What'd you have for breakfast this morning, mom?
3016440	3018680	As a special request, as the story continues,
3018720	3022200	whenever she says anything, can you say it as Jack Palance?
3022200	3023240	From Tango and Cash.
3024440	3027960	I want you to write one of your stories.
3027960	3029080	No, I'm not gonna do that.
3029080	3032240	But I write stories and I want you to write it
3032240	3033840	about a little boy that gets caught playing with matches
3033840	3037680	and learns to regret it.
3037680	3042680	So I think in my head, if I tackle this adequately,
3043400	3044680	this could be my ticket.
3046400	3048300	So I do, I sit down and I write.
3048900	3050780	Once upon a time, there's a little boy,
3050780	3052740	I was like, just lose that fucking bear in the bathtub.
3052740	3054980	Shit, this is the real deal, Harmon.
3054980	3057180	No, but it's who you are, it's who you are.
3057180	3058340	Write what you know.
3059740	3062300	And I write, a little boy got caught playing with matches
3062300	3065620	and then his dad came home and I just went into
3065620	3068380	all this detail about like, with their lighting leaves
3068380	3069820	on fire and they thought it was a good idea,
3069820	3072900	but boy, did they not know that it wasn't.
3072900	3077300	And at the end of my story, the dad comes home
3077300	3082300	and he reads the story that the little boy wrote.
3082540	3084060	See, you're already getting it.
3084060	3086260	This is why I got fired.
3087100	3088300	It's like, this is confusing.
3088300	3090260	It's a story about a story.
3093260	3095060	You were a meta, even Batman.
3096340	3099540	I think just lazy, but yes, it came to be called meta.
3101060	3103460	At the time, we just called it zero research.
3104460	3108500	At the end of the story, the dad comes home,
3108500	3113500	reads the story and realizes that the kid felt so bad
3114380	3117660	for playing with matches that he didn't need his spanking.
3118580	3121900	And the end, and I gave it to my mom
3121900	3125540	and my dad still wasn't home and my mom just read it
3125540	3128540	in silence, she went through, hmm, hmm.
3130220	3131860	This is really good.
3132860	3136860	I don't buy the ending, for real.
3137740	3139300	Not kidding.
3139300	3140660	Third act problems.
3140660	3141500	Yeah.
3144020	3147180	So I'm sorry, I don't handle notes well.
3148060	3152140	Sometimes it means I'm gonna die inside.
3152140	3153580	But she's right, you should have said,
3153580	3157020	and then my father came in and he kicked the shit out of me
3157020	3158660	and I called the police.
3158660	3159500	Right.
3160420	3165420	He's now serving 15 to 20 years in a minimum security prison.
3166340	3167580	The neighbors came over and said,
3167580	3170180	what the fuck is going on?
3170180	3172900	No one else is doing this.
3172900	3174180	You're insane.
3174180	3175860	This is like a horror movie.
3177020	3179540	Yeah, my parents always said, later when they,
3179540	3181220	everyone's parents, if there's anyone in this room
3181220	3183420	that's ever had hands-on parents, you know the story.
3183420	3185940	They always go, they turn into little raisins
3185940	3187660	and you feel, they're fine.
3187660	3189700	You play Peanuckle with them and they're like,
3189700	3193660	doesn't, you can never, and they always go like,
3193660	3196260	ah, it was the 70s, everyone was doing it.
3196260	3199060	And I'm like, name three people who were doing it.
3199060	3201980	John McEnroe, who was that?
3201980	3205500	Mary Lou Retton, who was doing it in the 70s?
3205500	3206860	Did you see it on a Wheaties box?
3206860	3208300	What are you talking about?
3209540	3210780	So yeah, then my dad came home
3210780	3212860	and the rest of the story is terrible.
3212860	3214380	But I never got my spanking, actually,
3214380	3217100	because my brother's was so bad that there was a medical.
3217740	3219060	Emergency, yeah, yeah.
3219060	3222180	My brother had recently had his tonsils taken out, so.
3222180	3223420	Shit takes a fucking turn.
3223420	3226500	And my dad, my dad often,
3226500	3228700	wait, I feel so bad if my parents listen to this,
3228700	3229780	because they're good people,
3229780	3231020	everybody should understand that.
3231020	3233300	Now that we're podcasting and I feel like you can't.
3233300	3235660	I think the statute of limitations is over.
3235660	3238020	No, but it's, no, but not on their emotions.
3238020	3240060	All right, yeah, you're probably right.
3240060	3241540	Yeah, you know what, it would be like
3241540	3245820	hitting my parents with a belt to talk about,
3248100	3251100	it would hurt them at a very vulnerable time in their lives
3251100	3252620	when they can't do anything about it.
3252620	3254580	How about this, Dan?
3255900	3260220	Why don't you tell the story, we'll record it,
3260220	3262500	but before we air it and we have the option to edit it,
3262500	3265620	have your mom and dad write a letter or a story.
3269660	3272620	How about a son who grows up to be a famous writer,
3272620	3275620	has a podcast, he can fucking lampoon those cocksuckers.
3276540	3278580	Come on, you met my parents, you love them, they're great.
3278580	3279420	They're great.
3279420	3281660	Everyone's great, the whole world is great.
3281660	3283780	It sounds like we end up in these rules
3283780	3285540	who are sealed off from each other,
3285540	3287340	not understanding things, acting out.
3287340	3291740	My brother, my dad came home, oh, matches, all right.
3291740	3292860	Well, I know what I have to do,
3292860	3295460	because my dad's dad did it and his dad's dad did it.
3295460	3298460	Nevermind the fact that all these people are insane.
3298460	3299860	My dad took off his belt
3299860	3301060	and he always had this catch phrase,
3301060	3302660	he'd say, this is gonna hurt me a lot more
3302660	3304100	than it's gonna hurt you.
3304100	3306020	But he was always so drunk,
3306020	3308060	he'd get it mixed up half the time.
3309980	3312140	And just say the scariest thing in the world,
3312140	3316660	this is gonna hurt you more than it's gonna hurt me.
3316660	3317940	I know that.
3319180	3322980	It's like, it's terrible.
3322980	3325620	And that's not the way it's supposed to work.
3325620	3327700	That's how cold I am and how-
3327700	3328860	It's like if a nurse said,
3328860	3331940	you're gonna feel a large stabbing in your arm.
3332940	3335940	And then the blood's gonna get siphoned out of your body.
3335940	3340500	But just think of puppies burning while I do it.
3340500	3342860	Now, what kind of father do you think you would make?
3342860	3345020	If you had kids, let's say you had two boys.
3345020	3347860	Let's say like five years from now or six years now,
3347860	3350980	you've got a five-year-old and a one-year-old.
3350980	3353220	What kind of father do you think you're prepared to be?
3353220	3354620	I don't know, man, that really scares me.
3354620	3355700	My girlfriend's in the audience.
3355700	3358380	But I was telling a story last week
3358380	3359900	of how I was working on shelving units
3359900	3362900	and Aaron was there and I cut the shelves wrong
3362900	3367740	at Home Depot and they didn't fit for like the third time,
3367740	3368580	back and forth.
3368580	3372020	And I just, fuck, I kicked shit and threw shit.
3372020	3375580	Sometimes the cat, before I figured out
3375580	3378940	what the cat was doing, why it was meowing with the-
3378940	3380180	It turns out I had a toy in its mouth
3380180	3381460	and I wanted to give me the toy.
3381460	3383580	But I was like, cat would just meow constantly.
3383580	3385980	And I was like, I don't know, I'd get up and chase it.
3385980	3389260	I'd be like, shut the fuck up.
3389260	3390260	And then I'd get angry.
3390260	3394100	Because the cat was giving you notes?
3394100	3396500	Because I don't know if you've ever met a two-year-old.
3396500	3397420	They give you fucking notes.
3397420	3399180	They give you a lot of notes, yeah.
3399180	3402460	They're not called the constructive twos.
3402460	3403740	No, I'm aware of this.
3403740	3407060	I've met my friend's children and I've read all about it.
3407060	3409740	And then it's only 13 years before they're adults
3409740	3412700	that can really, like Dino's daughter now,
3412700	3414100	adorable little Tigger.
3414100	3415780	I don't know if I'm allowed to say names of people
3415780	3418220	who aren't even legally allowed to defend themselves.
3418220	3420140	But I'm not going to say anything bad about her.
3420140	3421620	She's a little woman now.
3421620	3423500	We've known her ever since she was a little kid.
3423500	3425180	My friend Dino had a little daughter.
3425180	3430780	And I remember when she loved Bananas Foster.
3430780	3432580	It was a dessert that Dino would make for her.
3432580	3435540	And so I would do a little character called Bananas Foster.
3435540	3437500	And I'd go, hey, I'm Bananas Foster.
3437500	3439300	And I'd do a little dance and she'd giggle.
3439300	3440580	I was like a rock star.
3440580	3442940	And now she's just texting.
3442940	3445780	And every once in a while I catch a cold glance
3445780	3448260	and she's like, blech.
3448260	3451060	And I want to be like, fuck you.
3451060	3454860	Just because I'm not good at football.
3454860	3457100	There's that, too.
3457100	3460300	You've only got 12 years before they're actually like,
3460300	3463860	when they hit puberty, they become like,
3463860	3465660	now they're rolling their eyes at you
3465660	3468540	and they actually have eyes to roll and using sarcasm
3468540	3469020	and stuff.
3469020	3474660	That's only 12 years after it was adorable for one year.
3475580	3476820	Do you want to have children?
3476820	3478700	I do, really badly.
3478700	3485340	But I'm terrified that I'm not going to be able to handle it.
3485340	3487740	It was the whimper you were, how you said that.
3487740	3492860	I really, I feel, I really do.
3492860	3495100	I'm terrified I'm going to be a bad dad.
3495100	3497900	And I'm also, definitely, the solution
3497900	3501060	isn't to be one of these horrible pussy dads
3501060	3502300	that are all over LA.
3502300	3503840	You see people walking around Target
3503840	3505520	and the kids just screaming their head off
3505520	3507000	and the people are just going like,
3507000	3509920	Martin, use your indoor voice or whatever.
3509920	3512760	Come on, shame the kid.
3512760	3513840	It's public.
3513840	3516680	My mom only had to have one conversation with me.
3516680	3518480	She didn't need a wooden spoon for that.
3518480	3520600	I said some shit too loud in a Target.
3520600	3525280	And she was like, you don't talk like that outside the house.
3525280	3527440	And if she was allowed to, she would have said n-word.
3527440	3535840	It seemed like that was coming, didn't it?
3535840	3537640	Back in the 70s, everybody was doing it.
3537640	3539520	There was only one conversation.
3539520	3540720	I was like, we don't.
3540720	3542320	My mom would say it logically.
3542320	3544240	I remember the logic seeping into my brain,
3544240	3545600	being a movie theater.
3545600	3548920	And it was like, what if everyone was talking right now?
3548920	3549800	Shut up.
3549800	3550320	Yeah.
3550320	3551280	I go, oh, yeah.
3551280	3551800	She's right.
3551800	3553040	She's got a point.
3553040	3555000	I remember, I was at a friend's house
3555000	3560280	and I said something kind of rude in front of the kids
3560280	3561440	that I went to school with.
3561440	3562440	It was like a new school for me.
3562440	3563960	I had moved into a new neighborhood.
3563960	3569520	And I said something kind of cocky or suspend your disbelief.
3569520	3571480	I came in a little high.
3571480	3572560	I'm some kid.
3572560	3575200	I probably said something kind of arrogant and shitty.
3575200	3578480	And the mother, who I'd known a few months,
3578480	3582320	pulled me into the kitchen and just went whack across my face.
3582320	3584560	Another woman slapped you, not your mom.
3585560	3588400	Some woman, whom I will never remember her name,
3588400	3589480	she just pulled me into the kitchen.
3589480	3590640	Jeffrey, can I talk to you?
3590640	3592280	And I was like 12.
3592280	3595320	And she just clobbered me across the face.
3595320	3596640	And I was like, whoa.
3596640	3599200	And she's like, you're not better than my son.
3599200	3599680	Whoa.
3602680	3607600	Well, me thinks he pretests too much.
3607600	3609800	So I'm not that that's your takeaway.
3609800	3611520	No, no, no.
3611520	3612600	I'm fucking her.
3612600	3616440	It's a long story short.
3616440	3618200	And I mean, fucking her damn.
3618200	3619680	I am really like.
3619680	3622800	She's getting that 12-year-old Spiderman JD.
3627800	3629240	Should we do a?
3629240	3632080	I remember one time, when I was 12, around that age,
3632080	3634160	I remember this odd.
3634160	3636880	This actually bonded me with my mom, in a way,
3636880	3639040	because I suddenly realized the cycle of abuse
3639040	3640760	that was really happening.
3640760	3642400	She told me to feed the cat.
3642400	3643840	And I went, yeah, yeah.
3643840	3646880	And as I said that, I opened the closet door,
3646880	3648000	where the cat food was.
3648000	3650360	And I bent over to grab a can of cat food.
3650360	3654120	And I felt this unexpected sharp kick in my tailbone,
3654120	3656240	like really hard, like Charlie Brown going
3656240	3657800	for the football hard.
3657800	3659960	She just put everything into it.
3659960	3661520	But she wasn't Charlie Brown.
3661520	3663840	And my tailbone was there.
3663840	3665800	And if you've ever been kicked in the tailbone,
3665800	3669200	and also just any kind of unexpected impact
3669200	3673520	with your body, I had a can of cat food in my hand
3673520	3675080	and was 12 years old.
3675080	3676360	So I'm like cusping.
3676360	3680880	I have testosterone starting to kind of go through my blood
3680880	3681560	a little bit.
3681560	3684880	I probably had a little wispy Hitler mustache or something.
3684880	3688960	I got a little prepubescent little wisp on my upper lip.
3688960	3693920	And I instinctively, because some mammoth or saber-toothed
3693920	3696160	tiger is kicking me in the tailbone,
3696160	3699720	I wheeled around hefting this object in my hand,
3699720	3701040	this can of cat food.
3701040	3702600	And this was 80s cat food.
3702600	3704680	They used to come in big-ass cans
3704680	3707440	that you had to open with a device.
3707440	3710360	They hadn't figured out how to make portion them yet.
3710360	3713160	And I turned her out with this thing.
3713160	3716320	And my mom, who had just kicked me in the tailbone,
3716320	3720560	she made this sound in this face that was like,
3720560	3724320	ooh, like she wilted.
3724320	3725800	Oh, man.
3726320	3727320	Yeah.
3727320	3731320	And I was like, oh, I get it.
3731320	3734440	It's just like white trash, like larva becoming a bee.
3734440	3737640	You know, like I'm supposed to do this now.
3737640	3740600	And I was like, what is your, what did you do?
3740600	3742680	And she's like, I thought you were being snotty.
3742680	3746040	Like she just, she didn't know what she was doing.
3746040	3749280	And she knew what I was supposed to do.
3749280	3751640	And she was OK with it.
3751640	3756240	And I literally broke that cycle there in the pantry
3756240	3757640	that day for my sockets.
3757640	3759760	I was like, Jesus Christ, no.
3759760	3761520	I'm not going to bludgeon you to death
3761520	3765440	like Chris Penn at the end of shortcuts.
3765440	3769760	And then have kids of my own and find a nice closet
3769760	3770920	to store our cat food in.
3770920	3772400	I'm not going to keep doing this.
3772400	3773080	All right, let's do it.
3773080	3775960	We had some success with this as a closer for last week.
3775960	3777600	We got a bowl full of questions that
3777600	3778680	could do a lightning round.
3778680	3779200	Speed round.
3779200	3780440	Speed round.
3780440	3784120	All of my answers will be five words.
3784120	3784880	OK.
3784880	3785360	Woo!
3785360	3785860	Woo!
3785860	3786360	Woo!
3786360	3786860	Woo!
3786860	3787360	Woo!
3787360	3787860	Woo!
3787860	3788360	Woo!
3788360	3790000	No, no.
3790000	3791080	Three-word answers.
3791080	3792120	I like their attitude.
3792120	3792620	Yeah!
3792620	3793120	Woo!
3793120	3797840	And in honor of Aaron McGathey's soundboard last week,
3797840	3799480	I don't have the soundboard, but just, Aaron,
3799480	3800960	I want you to do a lightning round.
3800960	3803800	If you can yell it loud enough, the theme song.
3803800	3806280	Everybody, welcome to the Harmontown lightning round.
3806280	3808760	Da da da da da da!
3809760	3816640	If you could have sex with any mythical creature, which
3816640	3819880	would you pick and why?
3819880	3821880	You wish you had those five words now.
3821880	3824680	Cerebus, comma, more mouths.
3835400	3837040	I'm going to read this as written.
3837080	3840280	I'm going to read it as written, would ever write a play?
3842840	3845520	Yes, would.
3845520	3850480	Lady, are you a conspiracy theorist?
3850480	3855960	If so, do you have one in particular you firmly believe?
3855960	3857680	Well, Jews.
3857680	3858180	Pfft.
3862280	3862960	It was a joke.
3862960	3864720	I mimed getting shot in the head.
3864720	3866680	Everybody said, mime, we'll fix that.
3866680	3869400	There'll be a gunshot later on.
3869400	3872040	How can I get my producing career back on track?
3875760	3880080	I'm offended, asshole.
3880080	3882000	Because isn't that a bit, right?
3882000	3884440	It's not like Michael Bay's sitting in the back
3884440	3886400	that really wants to know that from me.
3886400	3888360	I think there might be somebody who actually
3888360	3889360	had a producing career.
3889360	3892720	Oh, no, you're saying that they're just taking the piss out
3892720	3894240	of me.
3894240	3897120	I haven't lost enough weight, but I have a nice black shirt.
3897120	3898200	Should I wear that?
3898200	3899840	They're kind of like, like.
3899840	3902040	How do I get a podcast without a structure?
3902040	3903160	Yeah.
3903160	3905720	Yeah, should I just do it?
3905720	3908520	How do I raise 200,000 plus on Kickstarter
3908520	3910480	without an established brand?
3910480	3913040	Yeah, now they're coming right at you.
3913040	3916640	Again, dickhead.
3916640	3918240	How many hand jobs?
3918240	3926160	By the way, that was one of the questions in the Tao Te Ching.
3926160	3928960	At least 20.
3928960	3929880	Fair enough.
3929880	3934400	How do you maintain hope for humanity
3934400	3938960	after things like the Dark Knight Rises shooting?
3938960	3940920	Ooh.
3940920	3942400	This is Max, right?
3942400	3943200	No, it's not you?
3943200	3944200	OK.
3944200	3945240	He's not even silly.
3945240	3947120	No, no, no, let's take it serious.
3947120	3947920	Let's take it serious.
3951280	3952240	Does that count as a word?
3952240	3953160	No.
3953160	3953880	Is that?
3953880	3955040	No.
3955040	3956080	That's three words.
3956080	3958200	No, no.
3958200	3959000	A no no.
3959000	3959760	It's a no no.
3962720	3963920	Lassie, what are you trying to say?
3969240	3969760	You OK?
3972560	3973240	Take it serious.
3974200	3974680	Realize.
3978520	3981480	I just painted himself into a corner.
3984680	3985680	Mankind fails.
3992680	3995520	I'm sorry.
3995520	3996520	Aaron, theme song.
3996520	3998120	Aaron, da da da da da.
3998120	3998920	All right.
3998920	4000120	Got time for 10 more.
4003840	4006960	How do I pass a piss drug test?
4006960	4008120	Penny in armpit.
4011120	4013320	He's not lying.
4013320	4015160	Uh-oh.
4015160	4016200	This one's just blank.
4016200	4018240	You want to answer that one?
4018240	4020840	So symbolic.
4020840	4021320	Right?
4021320	4022320	Uh-oh.
4022320	4034600	If I blow a guy to get a job in Hollywood, should I swallow?
4039200	4042520	Dad, you're drunk.
4042520	4047800	Thank you very much for coming to Harbontown in a minute.
4047800	4048760	We did it.
4048760	4050880	One more time.
4050880	4052680	Do you want to thank the people?
4052680	4055680	I'll thank the people, or do you want to thank the people?
4055680	4057200	First of all, your mayor, Dan Harmon.
4057200	4058200	Would you, one more time?
4060840	4062440	I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
4062440	4065680	I'd like to thank Katie Levine for doing our audio recording.
4065680	4068440	Zach McKeever, our tech technician guy.

4080720	4084800	for sitting down and answering the hard questions, everybody.
4084800	4088400	We will see you next week in Harbontown.
