0	5000	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Nerd Mel Theater, this is Harman Town.
5000	10000	Please welcome your mayor, Mr. Dan Harman.
10000	15000	Thank you.
15000	20000	Thank you.
20000	26000	Good to be back at our headquarters. We've been abroad a lot.
26000	33000	Unpredictable schedules. You never know when we're here, when we're not. Who's comptrolling? Who is? Who's not?
33000	36000	Whoever's just hanging out at your house.
36000	39000	Guess comptroller Dave Horowitz, everybody.
39000	44000	Hi, guys.
44000	50000	I have a couple things I could talk about, but I do think that we should be prepared for a terrible show.
50000	60000	No, no. I feel laconic. I feel neutral. The pressures of nuptials, nuptial pressure?
60000	61000	Impending nuptials, yes.
61000	65000	Impending nuptials? The pressure of impending nuptials?
65000	70000	The pressure of impending nuptials, yeah.
70000	76000	You compensate for them with a kind of dead calm.
76000	81000	Because you don't want to be one of these people that's nervous about getting married, because that would be dumb.
81000	85000	You'd be in a CERTs commercial or a Mentos commercial.
85000	90000	Looking for a quick fix because you blew a cuff link and then you put a Mentos in there.
90000	95000	Who cares? I'm cool. I live in L.A.
95000	100000	Joel McHale's going to be at my wedding. I'm not going to fucking put some pressure on it.
100000	106000	The guy from the soup's going to be there. He's going to smell fear like a dog.
106000	109000	He'll get up and start heckling me.
109000	110000	That'll never happen.
110000	114000	He'll call me a Kardashian. So I've got to be cool.
114000	120000	But nothing to do with that. It's obviously also the beginning of the second half.
120000	124000	The second and probably last half of my life.
124000	128000	You only get two.
128000	133000	When it comes to halves, you're guaranteed a maximum of two.
133000	140000	So when you're starting the second half of your life, there is a subtle realization there that you are now officially,
140000	144000	absolutely, officially dying.
144000	150000	Absolutely more so than being born. You are now more dying.
150000	158000	Because your next tasks include, for instance, helping someone else get born and handing the reins off to him
158000	169000	before your third heart attack proves irreconcilable, as the doctors might say in some strange universe where doctors are extra coy.
169000	173000	It's a truly romantic way to think about marriage.
173000	186000	Replication. Like the humble mosquito who lives its life and then at the end of its full mosquito life, which I think probably spans a day,
186000	191000	we're always like, what are you doing? Who flies in a face like that?
192000	195000	And the mosquito is like, this is it!
199000	201000	And we're just like, unbelievable, will you knock it off?
201000	203000	This is all I have!
206000	210000	It's comforting to think of things in those terms.
210000	217000	This is it. I am about to lay eggs in a puddle outside your mailbox.
218000	231000	Somewhere in some swampy land where hopefully a giant frog tongue won't rake across my deposits, rendering them pointless.
231000	235000	What's your frog tongue?
235000	237000	It's Chevy Chase.
237000	240000	Oh no! Does he know about the wedding?
240000	243000	He'll be back. He'll be back.
243000	247000	No, I just thought that was a comedy brain thing.
247000	251000	What should I say there? What is my frog tongue?
251000	254000	My frog tongue is spiders. Motherfucker!
256000	261000	So Erin came home and she saw a black widow with a web on the stairs.
261000	265000	She's taken pictures of it. She's like, oh, there's a black widow.
265000	271000	It's got an hourglass on its back. It was eating a caterpillar in the fucking thing.
272000	278000	Everything about them has to be so maudlin and extreme.
278000	281000	It couldn't just be eating a fly.
281000	285000	That thing was art directed to scare you.
285000	288000	An hourglass on its back eating a caterpillar.
288000	290000	A fly. That's hoi polloi shit.
290000	298000	Only the fact of an unbaptized caterpillar will quench this black widow's thirst.
299000	303000	It's sitting there watching it wriggle.
303000	310000	It's a black widow. If they bite you, it probably won't kill you.
310000	320000	But if you're a small child or a lamb, a baby lamb, it'll take you out.
321000	331000	And when's the last time you went to work on enough toxins to take out a baby lamb?
331000	336000	That's going to fuck up my shooting schedule, which is a professional form of death.
336000	341000	Black widows are dangerous. They're not brown look recluses, but they're dangerous.
341000	346000	I don't remember what the point was. Oh, that's my frog's tongue. Spiders.
346000	352000	Okay. I was in the middle of something. What was it?
352000	355000	Oh, I'm dying because I'm getting married.
355000	360000	My body knows that, but my mind therefore puts this like...
360000	364000	I have no choice over it. My mind is just going like,
364000	369000	Hey man, what's good? I have to affect this weird McConaughey drawl.
369000	374000	I don't care about anything. I don't know. Just get married, man.
374000	380000	Because otherwise I'll panic and I'll achieve my final form.
380000	382000	But you're going to be feeling it up there.
382000	386000	The emotional flood will be too much for your steely McConaughey reserve.
386000	393000	I don't plan on spending the ceremony itself withholding anything. I will give it my all.
393000	402000	But it's a week of nerves for the nerve full.
402000	405000	So one mitigates one's nerves.
405000	413000	I'm definitely going to cry. Not right now, but when it happens.
413000	416000	I might cry right now.
416000	418000	Do you want to cry right now?
418000	422000	Yeah. Do you want to say something sad to me?
422000	428000	You know me a little. Maybe get really in there in my insecurities and I'll see what happens.
428000	434000	Do you know that when they cleared the debris at Waco.
434000	441000	They found the skeletons of preteen children who died in the arms of their parents.
441000	447000	But they hadn't burnt to death because they could tell because the skeletons were bent backwards,
447000	450000	which is a sign of cyanide poisoning.
450000	457000	They had they had they had died in terrible pain that broke their own backs like.
458000	460000	He's laughing.
460000	462000	I made him laugh.
462000	466000	I it. I am so I was so close to actually.
466000	468000	I was like, this isn't going to work.
468000	470000	It was like it got too real. It's too real.
470000	473000	I felt too many things in 30 seconds.
473000	475000	Fuck you, man.
475000	476000	That's not cool.
476000	478000	OK, I'll tell you.
478000	481000	I'll make you cry. I'll tell you something. I'll make you cry.
481000	482000	OK, go ahead.
482000	491000	See, did you know that when you mute someone on Twitter, if they tweet at you, you'll still see it.
491000	493000	It really doesn't matter.
493000	499000	The only people you can mute are just people who just spout nonsense into the dry air like that.
499000	500000	Yes, we all have one.
500000	502000	Wait, they you really see it if they tweet at you, even if you.
502000	507000	Isn't that true, right? No.
507000	508000	No.
508000	514000	So there's so there's like 50 people right now tweeting me all the time going like, hello.
514000	517000	I addressed that joke to you like that.
517000	518000	I'm just ignoring them.
518000	521000	OK, that's all right.
521000	526000	Well, good. That's the way it should work.
526000	528000	Why even why even block anybody anymore, then?
528000	534000	Right. I mean, I I I did a large unfollow recently.
534000	537000	I mean, I don't have quite the.
537000	541000	Nobody cared that I did it, but I was like, I can't.
541000	550000	I muted a few people and it didn't it didn't give me the same rush as just going, you're out the fuck out of my not real life.
550000	558000	You know about you know about our podcast producer, Dustin Marshall's thing, right?
558000	560000	I mean, he's got a lot of things.
560000	564000	Yeah. He I feel like I might.
564000	568000	My instinct is to whisper this because I hear no matter what.
568000	571000	I feel like I'm somehow like it's less harsh.
571000	576000	Like I feel like I'm embarrassing him less because I'm keeping my voice down.
576000	578000	Yeah, he's got headphones on.
578000	588000	Yeah. But I you know that he he he he he keeps his followers number like the people that he's following is six six six.
588000	596000	Six six six. And he so he can't start or stop following someone without replacing them so he can keep the number.
596000	601000	Yeah. At six six six.
601000	605000	Wait, I mean, no matter what's going on with you, it could always be worse.
605000	610000	Is it better or worse that I do the same thing but with 420?
610000	616000	I think it makes me like way more chill, but I could be wrong.
616000	619000	I'm it's a rhetorical question, right?
619000	622000	Yeah, no one's chiller than me.
622000	628000	Hey, did you know you could fit every planet in the solar system between the Earth and the moon?
628000	634000	Spencer just told me that.
634000	639000	It's true. I don't. Why did I say it's true? Like I'm the judge. It's true.
639000	641000	I just found out.
641000	645000	Did you know you can fit all of Boston in Brooklyn?
646000	648000	That's true.
648000	653000	That's what someone told me when I told them I was from Boston and they they were from New York and they were like, you don't live in a real city.
653000	658000	And I was like, prove it. Like your whole city could fit in my burrow.
658000	662000	I was like, cool, Spike Lee.
662000	666000	Like I was saying they were like Spike. It wasn't actually Spike Lee.
666000	672000	I heard a guy rapping once about how each of his fingers was a burrow.
673000	678000	And so when he makes a fist, he's got the whole he's got all of New York in the palm of his hand.
678000	680000	And I think it was Lloyd. What's his name?
680000	682000	Lloyd Benson.
682000	684000	Lloyd Webber.
684000	686000	Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.
686000	687000	Lloyd Banks.
687000	689000	Yeah, he said he goes.
689000	697000	Yeah, the trigger finger is Staten Island and the middle finger is Queens and the I used to sling rock in Manhattan.
697000	699000	So you know, the Pinky's what I mean.
699000	711000	Ring finger is the Bronx because I hope that to meet the love of my life there one day, if my if my current career trajectory takes me where I hope to go.
711000	716000	But I digress. And the and the thumb is is Radio City Music Hall.
716000	719000	I don't remember all the burrows.
719000	722000	And then and then I think that that's kind of cool.
722000	727000	There's there's there's no way that the real song is better than that.
727000	729000	That was the best.
729000	735000	And also, I did like you said, I heard a guy rapping once like you walked past him on the street and then you're like, it was Lloyd.
735000	744000	Well, it was part of that part of that Busta Rhymes song that he did, like 40, 40, 40, 40, 40,000 remixes of.
744000	745000	Don't touch me.
745000	747000	Touch, touch, touch it.
747000	748000	Touch.
748000	749000	Don't do touch it.
749000	753000	Touch it. Touch it. Stop it. Form it. Make it go. It. Do it.
753000	759000	And you know that. Well, put it in your plate and put it on a bowl and tester.
759000	762000	Bigger, bigger and it's bigger, stronger.
762000	763000	Lift out those weights.
763000	764000	Mr.
764000	777000	And then he has like celebrity friends come in and go, yo, yo, Missy.
777000	780000	Oh, best time, Missy Elliott.
780000	781000	What is it?
781000	782000	Oh, make it.
782000	783000	Wow.
783000	784000	I'm going to make it.
784000	793000	So you see, you see, you know, you know, you know, you know, but for bags, I'm not taking it.
793000	794000	Take a DMX.
794000	799000	I love you.
799000	800000	Lloyd banks.
800000	806000	You know, you know, the trick is that I went in the middle fingers with the ring fingers, the Bronx.
806000	809000	Because you know what I say, I got the pinky and the queens in the usual way.
809000	810000	I put them all together.
810000	814000	They got a fist and a punch the whole city, even though I love it.
814000	819000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, remix.
819000	821000	It won a Grammy.
821000	824000	Yeah.
824000	828000	I don't know why you guys are staring at me.
828000	831000	What other songs don't you know?
831000	832000	I can touch it.
832000	833000	Remix.
833000	834000	Touch it.
834000	837000	My thumb is the subway.
837000	840000	He did one that was just all the queens of the game.
840000	843000	There's a little dog for the cap to the fairer sex.
843000	845000	He had Mary J.
845000	846000	Yeah.
846000	847000	Busta Rhymes.
847000	848000	Yeah.
848000	849000	Busta Rhymes is like, yeah, I'm back.
849000	850000	Oh, remix.
850000	851000	Part eight.
851000	852000	Oh, 2007.
852000	853000	I'm coming at you.
853000	856000	The Queens of the game.
856000	859000	And then like, he had like, go, go Mary J.
859000	861000	And I was like, oh, it's Mary J.
861000	864000	And then, but then in the video for it, they like switches back and forth.
864000	865000	It doesn't.
866000	867000	Does Mary J.
867000	870000	Blige have like a, have like an alter ego?
870000	871000	No.
871000	873000	She's like a very soulful lady.
873000	874000	I know.
874000	875000	That's kind of her thing.
875000	876000	I feel like Mary J.
876000	877000	Blige.
877000	880000	Like, you know how Garth Brooks had like that angel, angel man, whatever.
880000	881000	Yeah.
881000	883000	Chris Gaines, Chris Gaines, brooding bangs.
883000	884000	I feel like Mary J.
884000	888000	Blige had like a, had like a bad guy persona that was like Bliggy, Bliggy,
888000	891000	Bliggy, Bliggy Mary or something.
891000	893000	It was like, it was like Mitzel Plick or something.
893000	894000	It was like backwards.
894000	898000	And that, that she could, she could say like, like, like less soulful things.
898000	901000	I thought, I thought that was depicted in the video too.
901000	906000	Like she was, I could be mixing a bunch of stuff up, but check it out, kids.
908000	910000	I don't want to look for this song now.
910000	913000	I mean, there's nine, literally nine remixes of it.
913000	916000	I mean, if I look, if I just do touch it in Google, I'm not going to find it.
916000	920000	Stick it, put it, stick it, put it, poop it in your booty.
922000	923000	Yeah.
923000	926000	I'll just, I'll just do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
926000	927000	It's pretty cool.
927000	929000	It's a cool song.
929000	933000	It was at least nominated for a VMA in 2006.
933000	935000	I know that for sure.
935000	940000	I'll just go into my Excel spreadsheet of 2006 VMA nominees that I keep in,
940000	942000	in Google drive that you and I share.
942000	944000	So you should just be able to have it right now.
944000	946000	So Erin was making fun of me playing Minecraft.
946000	949000	I play a lot of Minecraft and then Erin makes fun.
949000	954000	Like she looks over at the laptop and then she asks me questions about
954000	960000	Minecraft that are designed not to, not for her to start like enjoying the game.
960000	964000	Like it's not, she acts like it's like her like becoming interested in Minecraft,
964000	968000	but it's just to shame me and mock me for playing Minecraft.
968000	973000	So she asked me last night, she said, did you, she just, there's just a barrage of
973000	974000	stuff.
974000	975000	I'm like, I'm just, I'll be cutting down a tree.
975000	980000	And she goes, like, are you, did you get your, did you remember your backpack?
980000	986000	And I just like try to ignore her and go like, there's no backpacks.
986000	988000	I'm cutting down a tree.
988000	989000	Oh yeah.
989000	994000	Did you, do you need to, do you need scorpion poison?
994000	995000	No, there's nothing.
995000	1002000	And then she, and then she said, do you, do you have all of your scent gems?
1002000	1007000	And then she started laughing so hard, she almost died in bed.
1007000	1015000	She couldn't breathe because she was so entertained by her rift scent gems.
1015000	1017000	So I wrote down scent gems.
1017000	1020000	Those are really some of the best laps you can have when it doesn't matter
1020000	1022000	even what the other person's enjoyment level is.
1022000	1027000	But when you say something that tickles you to your, deeply to your core,
1027000	1029000	you can just ride that out for an hour.
1029000	1032000	I would, I would, I would take that version to Erin all the, all the time.
1032000	1035000	Like that's my, like what she, she makes herself laugh.
1035000	1041000	And then she goes, she can't take it anymore.
1041000	1049000	Like it usually has to be, you know, victimizing someone else in order for her to find it really that funny.
1049000	1058000	She must have just really made a lot of fun of me to be laughing so hard that her epiglottis is like revolting.
1058000	1061000	But I do like the sound. It's the sound of true joy.
1061000	1066000	You can, yeah, if you could bottle it, depression would be gone, man.
1066000	1072000	Or if I could just live, live with it by virtue of legal vow for the next 40 to 55 years.
1072000	1074000	And you can!
1076000	1082000	Polite clapping for impending nuptials, impending nuptials.
1082000	1086000	All right, so I want to bring Spencer Crittenden up here unceremoniously.
1087000	1089000	Spencer!
1098000	1102000	Oh, what's, what's up? It's good to be back.
1102000	1104000	Thank you.
1106000	1111000	This is our first show back since terminating the tour, right?
1112000	1114000	Yeah, I think we were back here for, well, the Joel McHale-
1114000	1116000	That was during the tour.
1116000	1123000	Okay. Well, the definition of tour I don't get because we, you know, I'd be working every day and then I'd have to get on a red eye and go to-
1123000	1126000	Hey, me too. I was doing those same things.
1126000	1130000	I know, but I don't know when you call it a tour then because it's like, it's not really a tour.
1130000	1135000	If you go to the post office, it's not a tour because you're leaving your home.
1135000	1138000	I would never consider that a tour, no.
1139000	1141000	It's more of a trip.
1142000	1144000	Spencer, do you like Busta Rhymes?
1144000	1148000	Yeah, that was so great. It was, it was-
1148000	1153000	I don't think Busta would be happy with that, but I was, I was quite tickled.
1153000	1156000	Busta Rhymes! Oh, wow, did you want that?
1156000	1161000	He wouldn't disagree that he says his own name at least 12 times a song. He does.
1161000	1163000	It's in his record contract, I think.
1163000	1166000	Wait, Dan, is this the song?
1169000	1172000	No, no.
1177000	1180000	Don't touch me! Throw the water on him.
1180000	1187000	Touch It remix, it can't be that hard to find. It was, it was quite a popular song among the hips and the hops.
1187000	1195000	If it was Touch It, there's been remixes by everyone who's existed, so it might be actually a bit hard to hone in on.
1196000	1200000	You know, you talked about that spider. What was the end of that spider story?
1200000	1204000	When we last left, it still existed in your house. What the fuck?
1204000	1208000	Well, Aaron, it's not in the house. It was out by the mailbox.
1208000	1209000	Okay, still.
1209000	1216000	Every time you're walking up those dark stairs to my mansion, now there's a new reason you could die,
1216000	1223000	other than just you'll fall and, like, cut yourself open on these sharpened dreamwork stairs.
1223000	1227000	I always think about that. Those dreamwork stair impalements.
1227000	1231000	Now, if you, now you might fall down on the last thing you'll see as a spider going like,
1231000	1235000	Oh my god, it's the biggest caterpillar ever!
1237000	1239000	You don't want to kill it or anything?
1239000	1246000	Aaron takes care of that stuff. She's, she has a video of the spider and a video of her killing it.
1246000	1248000	Oh, she killed it!
1248000	1250000	So then I came home, she killed it.
1250000	1251000	Yeah, okay.
1251000	1252000	Your enclosure!
1252000	1254000	Thank you. That's all I needed to hear.
1254000	1259000	So I came home and I do a sweep with the flashlight. Now I'm on the lookout for Black Widow.
1259000	1260000	Sure.
1260000	1266000	And, you know, and I find eight, nine, ten of them.
1266000	1268000	Like, they're everywhere.
1268000	1269000	What?
1269000	1270000	Well, because I don't know what they look like.
1270000	1271000	Oh.
1271000	1272000	Oh.
1272000	1278000	And so I'm, all spiders are now Black Widows and I'm like, because I'm not going to look for the hourglass
1278000	1281000	and some of them are small and I'm like, there's Black Widows everywhere.
1281000	1284000	We should call a service of some kind.
1284000	1288000	And then Aaron was like, those are Black Widows. That's not a really, it's not a story.
1288000	1292000	I like it though. I just am glad that she killed it.
1292000	1297000	I mean, I don't hate spiders, but when it's a Black Widow, I mean, that's, geez, you don't want to,
1297000	1299000	you don't want to tangle with that sort of thing.
1299000	1304000	Here's the weird thing about Aaron, or not weird at all really, if you know her personality.
1304000	1316000	Like when there's a spider on the wall in the house, like I just go like, okay, I'll, if I have to, I'll just, I'll find something and I'll kill it.
1316000	1319000	I'm superstitious about it for some dumb reason.
1319000	1321000	That's a classic superstition.
1321000	1323000	I know. It's so stupid.
1323000	1326000	But like before I'll do that, Aaron will be like, I'll take care of it.
1326000	1332000	But Aaron will just like, she, I don't, so there's some people who are like really good with spiders.
1332000	1334000	And then there's some people who are terrified of them.
1334000	1344000	Aaron just, I always, she just, if I describe her behavior to you, like, like, you wouldn't know which one she was because she just, she'll take like a coat hanger and just poke at it.
1344000	1348000	Like, and then they'll like, like, I don't even know what she's trying to do.
1348000	1349000	Just agitate it.
1349000	1351000	And I'll go like, why are you, what are you trying to do?
1351000	1359000	No, just, and then she's like poking it and then the spider like fall onto the floor and then she'll go, ah!
1360000	1362000	What are you doing?
1362000	1364000	I don't, I don't, what, what's the attempt?
1364000	1371000	Like, she wanted it to crawl onto the coat hanger and she was going to be like, ah, ah, gentle, gentle Ben?
1371000	1373000	Or what's a?
1373000	1374000	It's gentle Ben.
1374000	1375000	Yeah, we all know.
1375000	1377000	No, who is Dan? Dan Hangerty played him.
1377000	1378000	Gentle Ben.
1378000	1379000	No, no, no.
1379000	1381000	Grizzly, Grizzly Adams.
1381000	1383000	Grizzly Adams.
1386000	1387000	I like gentle Ben.
1388000	1392000	Whose gentle Ben was the name of the bear in Grizzly Adams, I think.
1392000	1394000	I thought you just called him Ben.
1395000	1397000	Grizzly Adams was a show in the 70s.
1397000	1401000	This is, this is how little you could take your business elsewhere on network TV.
1401000	1406000	Grizzly Adams was just a guy that lived in the woods and that is it.
1408000	1410000	He wasn't wanted for a murder he hadn't committed.
1410000	1412000	He wasn't a counterfeiter.
1412000	1414000	He wasn't, he couldn't turn into a snake.
1415000	1417000	His parents weren't vampires.
1417000	1419000	He didn't, he didn't go on dates.
1419000	1424000	He sat in a fucking cabin and he had a beard and he hung out.
1424000	1428000	And it was like, I guess the other two networks had news on it or something.
1429000	1430000	Did they make a lot of episodes?
1430000	1432000	Yeah, I think it was on all the time.
1432000	1434000	Like I'm, it's burnt into my memory.
1434000	1437000	And he had obviously friends who also lived in the woods.
1437000	1439000	There was a guy that was like a prospector.
1439000	1440000	Sure.
1440000	1444000	Who had a mule and he would walk around up in the hills and he was like very cranky.
1444000	1448000	And then, so then Grizzly Adams was like a kind of cool like,
1448000	1451000	knights in white satin kind of shirt.
1451000	1454000	But he would cut his own wood and he had a big beard and long hair.
1454000	1458000	And he would just go like, hey cranky, cranky Tom, whatever the guy's name was.
1458000	1460000	Don't be so mean.
1460000	1462000	He just, he just lived in the woods.
1462000	1464000	It sounds like a children's show the way I'm describing it.
1464000	1467000	It sounds like somebody would like play on a loop in a museum or something.
1468000	1469000	Yeah.
1469000	1471000	It sounds like something that will inevitably teach you about weights and
1471000	1473000	measures or something.
1473000	1474000	Yeah.
1474000	1475000	It's a Canadian.
1475000	1476000	You stick around long enough.
1476000	1479000	There's like a teaching moment about splitting wood and angles and stuff.
1479000	1480000	All right.
1480000	1482000	So I want to address some concerns about my dog.
1482000	1483000	Oh.
1485000	1489000	So I don't, and I don't know how much of this I have explained at the show yet,
1489000	1495000	but I know like, like the, the new TVs, the dogs can see them.
1498000	1500000	They're watching what we watch now.
1500000	1504000	Their eyes and our eyes are seeing the same thing because of the TVs are
1504000	1505000	different now.
1505000	1507000	I'm telling you.
1507000	1508000	You're right.
1508000	1514000	And Harvey, if there's ever a dog or a squirrel or a cat or a, and he'll react
1514000	1520000	to each one differently or a deer, but like not a cockroach, like, like he
1520000	1522000	won't, he differentiates it.
1522000	1524000	But like a cartoon cat.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1528000	That was the new thing was that then we were, they were watching the Simpsons
1528000	1531000	and Santa's little helper came on cartoon dog.
1531000	1533000	Harvey starts going nuts.
1533000	1535000	He's recognizing a cartoon dog.
1535000	1538000	That's the next step is he could read the word dog.
1538000	1539000	Yeah.
1542000	1544000	That's a, it's a symbol for a dog.
1544000	1549000	It's not, it doesn't even, how could it have any, any, it doesn't make any sense.
1549000	1550000	And we tested it.
1550000	1551000	Like he doesn't eat.
1551000	1555000	He looks at the cartoon of the dog and he starts going crazy.
1555000	1556000	Yeah.
1556000	1560000	We were, I think he was watching or he was watching with the, like the rainbow
1560000	1563000	bright cartoon movie was on and there's like a scene with like a kid in the snow
1563000	1566000	and he's got a dog and Harvey just started going nuts.
1566000	1571000	And I was watching him and I couldn't believe it, but also he freaks out when
1571000	1572000	he sees himself.
1572000	1573000	If you like show him a picture.
1573000	1574000	Well, that's what Aaron did.
1574000	1577000	And I was like, by the time I caught Aaron doing it, it was too late because
1577000	1583000	Aaron, Aaron videotaped with her phone, Harvey, put it, air played it onto the
1583000	1586000	TV. So Harvey starts going ape shit.
1586000	1587000	Yeah.
1591000	1597000	And that's so, so Aaron, because she's insane, she, she videotaped Harvey doing
1597000	1598000	that.
1599000	1600000	Yeah.
1600000	1601000	And then air plays that.
1601000	1602000	Yeah.
1602000	1608000	And then, and it's a video of the dog going at a dog and the real life dog goes
1608000	1619000	like, so then she does it again and she's, and I, and she showed it to me and I was
1619000	1623000	like, stop that you're making him sentient.
1623000	1624000	Yeah.
1625000	1630000	I saw like the fifth generation of it where it was like a crazy, like, like where
1631000	1636000	you shine a TV at a TV and there was just like a dog watching a dog, he's like,
1639000	1643000	like the next thing would be like, he would go, I am.
1648000	1649000	Yeah.
1649000	1652000	And I don't know why that would be a goal.
1654000	1656000	She just thought it was funny.
1656000	1658000	It was disturbing.
1658000	1662000	Because I think as fun as it seems hypothetically, like, no, we wouldn't like
1662000	1667000	it if he could, if he was sentient, like if he could speak, he wouldn't be happy
1667000	1668000	about his situation.
1668000	1669000	No, he would not.
1669000	1671000	He would be like, what the fuck are you guys doing to me?
1671000	1672000	Why are you showing me this?
1672000	1673000	What did you do to me?
1673000	1674000	Where are my texticals?
1674000	1677000	I mean, I, I've written about this.
1680000	1681000	Yeah.
1681000	1685000	I mean, that was, yeah, that episode of Rick and Morty was based on Justin's
1685000	1687000	love of his little Malteses.
1687000	1691000	I didn't have a dog at that time, but yeah, it's very disturbing.
1691000	1695000	The dog, he, he, he, he understands shit.
1695000	1700000	Like he, and he, like, he's like, I come home and he doesn't even, I started to
1700000	1704000	get mad that he, like, he just sits at the top of the stairs and like, I come
1704000	1707000	home and he doesn't even, like, he doesn't come down to the door and he like, he
1707000	1711000	like lifts his head up and then he wags his tail, like, while he's laying down.
1711000	1714000	And I just felt kind of like, and then I get to the top of the stairs and he
1714000	1720000	rolls over, so I get scratched his belly and I'm like, I, I, I, I work for him.
1720000	1725000	And so I was like, it'd be nice if he, I mean, when the pizza guy comes over, he
1725000	1729000	goes down to the door and Aaron says, cause he's got pizza.
1729000	1735000	And I'm like, well, Aaron says here, I'll put a bag of treats in the potted
1735000	1737000	plant outside the door.
1737000	1742000	When you come home from work, take a treat and then, you know, give him a treat
1742000	1746000	every time you come in and then he'll, and then he'll, you'll get the pizza guy
1746000	1749000	treatment if that's what you want so bad.
1749000	1754000	And, uh, no, it's like the first, the first time we tried it, I come in and
1754000	1757000	he's like, I think he could hear the bag.
1757000	1759000	And then I got the treat.
1759000	1763000	And so then the second night I come home, I open the door and he goes straight to
1763000	1766000	the potted plant.
1766000	1770000	He's like, oh, he said he's, yeah, every time he comes home, he, there's that bag
1770000	1772000	of the plant.
1772000	1774000	He's way too smart.
1774000	1780000	There's, there have been times and like, you know, so I'm a, I've, I've never had
1780000	1785000	a pet in my whole life and that's too long because I'm like a gross dog person.
1785000	1790000	Like not gross, but like I'm, I love dogs the most and I've, I think Harvey's my
1790000	1791000	friend.
1791000	1796000	So we have like a, we're friends, but every, there are times when I will look at
1796000	1800000	him and I will think that there's a man in a dog suit because he's, his eyes are
1800000	1801000	too expressive.
1801000	1804000	He has those weird, those whites of his eyes.
1804000	1805000	Yeah.
1805000	1807000	And it's backing up as a balance.
1807000	1808000	Yeah.
1808000	1810000	It just looks like a dude.
1810000	1813000	Like you expect me to be like, Hey, like if you're rubbing his belly and he's
1813000	1817000	like, Hey man, a little, if you said like a little to the left, I would, I would
1817000	1821000	freak out, but not as much as if another dog would be like, Oh yeah, okay.
1821000	1822000	What?
1822000	1824000	He sleeps in between me and Aaron.
1824000	1830000	Like a, like an eight year old boy.
1830000	1833000	Wait, what?
1833000	1839000	You know, like before, when you got a car, when you got a dog, when you hired that
1839000	1843000	eight year old boy to sleep with him, he sleeps right in the eight year old boy spot
1843000	1849000	on my bed.
1849000	1856000	Uh, I had, uh, there was, uh, there was something else.
1856000	1858000	I felt like there was something else.
1858000	1863000	Oh, can we, Hey, can we, can we tee up at least just so it's at the ready?
1863000	1872000	Just like a, like a, like a, just a, uh, kind of a laid back rap beat.
1872000	1875000	Oh, I guess not.
1876000	1877000	Nice.
1877000	1878000	Nice comptroller.
1878000	1884000	Cause I feel like it's a lazy show and a, and a, and I, I wanted to try to embrace
1884000	1888000	that and turn it into entertainment and get myself a little excited.
1888000	1891000	Cause you can, you can tell I'm phoning it in.
1891000	1893000	I can't know.
1893000	1894000	Yeah.
1894000	1898000	Oh, I have suspicions, but I can't tell.
1898000	1899000	Well, you guys have other stuff to do.
1899000	1900000	I think they can tell.
1900000	1902000	They didn't really think that until you said it.
1902000	1909000	No, that guy knew who, uh, who came here from the farthest tonight.
1909000	1911000	Moscow, Moscow.
1911000	1912000	Who's the Moscow guy?
1912000	1913000	I don't even know what you said.
1913000	1915000	You could have said, I need a kidney.
1915000	1917000	Help me.
1917000	1920000	Do you want to come up Moscow and just talk to us?
1920000	1922000	We won't pick on you.

1979000	1981000	Actually, that was my name.
1981000	1984000	Oh, no, no, no.
1984000	1990000	I didn't, I didn't mean it was a, I didn't mean it didn't sound like a name.
1990000	1996000	I saw a hesitance on your face and I thought maybe that you American analog is something
1996000	1997000	like Eugene.
1997000	1998000	Oh, you do.
1998000	2000000	So is it a Chinese name?
2000000	2002000	Uh, not Eugene.
2002000	2004000	The other one.
2004000	2008000	What is the, what's the origin of the, of your real name?
2008000	2009000	Russian.
2009000	2010000	You're born in Russian.
2010000	2011000	That's your Russian name.
2011000	2016000	Uh, actually I was born in Russian, but my grandfather is from Vietnam.
2016000	2018000	I never knew him.
2018000	2019000	So is that a Vietnamese name?
2019000	2020000	The first one you mentioned?
2020000	2023000	No, no, it's actually, it's totally Russian.
2023000	2024000	Totally Russian.
2024000	2025000	Okay.
2025000	2026000	That's, can you say it again?
2026000	2027000	Cause I.
2027000	2028000	Uh, Zhenia.
2028000	2029000	Zhenia.
2029000	2030000	Okay.
2030000	2031000	I, you know what?
2031000	2034000	I'm racist because when you said Zhenia, I pictured it spelled with an X and a bunch
2034000	2037000	of like vowels.
2037000	2046000	Uh, the, uh, so Eugene is the way it gets kind of, uh, you've got, uh, Bushkin version
2046000	2052000	of, uh, you've getting an egg and it's like Eugene.
2052000	2057000	Have you seen you've Guinea before a lot, but never the way that you just pronounced
2057000	2059000	it this for your name.
2059000	2060000	Well, it's like, uh, it's different.
2060000	2061000	It's like a modification though.
2061000	2063000	And they're similar names.
2063000	2065000	It's a shorter version.
2065000	2066000	Oh, okay.
2066000	2068000	Have you lived in Russia your whole life?
2068000	2069000	Yeah.
2069000	2071000	And this is the first time you've been in the U S.
2071000	2072000	Yeah.
2072000	2074000	So how does it come to be that you're all of your worldly possession?
2074000	2077000	Is it just, you travel, you travel to the hill?
2077000	2083000	Well, I can tell a long Russian, uh, short Russian.
2083000	2089000	I guess it all depends on, uh, if it involves werewolves or, or chess.
2089000	2095000	Uh, well, uh, Joe McHale counts as werewolves.
2096000	2097000	Sure.
2097000	2098000	Sure.
2098000	2099000	Definitely.
2099000	2103000	Well, uh, his hair certainly changes at night.
2106000	2112000	Well, uh, actually I saw John McHale messed up some video show and, uh, uh,
2112000	2121000	everyone's talked about his, oh, he just didn't give them about that video show.
2121000	2126000	And I just wanted to get to know what's this guy.
2126000	2127000	He's okay.
2127000	2130000	He's, these games are just shitty.
2130000	2133000	And he's don't like to be here.
2133000	2139000	And he made the final guy who wears all jackets in LA.
2139000	2142000	I don't know how many.
2142000	2145000	So Joe, Joe McHale was on a show that you.
2145000	2146000	Yeah.
2146000	2151000	Basically, uh, Joe McHale, uh, looks, he Googled, Googled him.
2151000	2154000	He's, uh, in the community.
2154000	2160000	He's, uh, uh, I, what's, what's community.
2160000	2164000	I watch that show and.
2164000	2167000	So you're, you're, you're a huge fan of Joe McHale.
2167000	2169000	So you Googled community.
2169000	2175000	I knew the guy, but he looked nice.
2176000	2181000	How did you first, how did you first come upon Joe McHale?
2184000	2186000	Just watching TV in Russia.
2186000	2191000	Uh, no, it's say thanks to piracy.
2191000	2193000	Yeah.
2193000	2198000	You don't, you downloaded Joe McHale.
2198000	2200000	Uh, you're actually community.
2200000	2204000	We don't have, uh, what you're saying is the, yeah, you're in Russia.
2204000	2206000	You bit torrented community.
2206000	2207000	Yeah.
2207000	2209000	Or something that Joel was in and then you're like, what the hell is this?
2209000	2212000	And are you saying that you made a pilgrimage to come see this show?
2212000	2214000	Because I mean.
2214000	2220000	Actually, because, uh, of the Hamilton because, uh, in, in the end I got
2220000	2229000	into Hamilton and I started at first, uh, not season episode session.
2229000	2239000	Uh, and, uh, I listened through all these series and, uh, who's Adam Goldberg?
2249000	2250000	Is this real?
2250000	2253000	Is that real?
2253000	2256000	It was so flawless.
2256000	2261000	At this point you could be a highly trained upright citizens brigade.
2261000	2262000	Yeah.
2262000	2264000	Practical joke.
2264000	2273000	Uh, I just Googled him and, uh, there's a guy that plays, uh, in the seven private
2273000	2277000	Ryan's is the Jew guy.
2277000	2280000	Oh, you found the wrong Adam Goldberg.
2280000	2281000	Yeah.
2281000	2282000	The days.
2282000	2283000	Oh yeah.
2283000	2284000	Yeah.
2284000	2285000	Yeah.
2285000	2286000	Yeah.
2286000	2288000	Uh, is Adam here?
2288000	2289000	Are you here?
2289000	2290000	Adam.
2290000	2297000	I bet we thought we'd never hear you say those words.
2297000	2302000	Uh, Adam, do you want to come up and meet this, uh, this guy's, this guy's traveled
2302000	2303000	the globe.
2303000	2306000	I mean, not to meet you, but he's just curious about you.
2306000	2307000	I'd hope not.
2307000	2308000	How's it going?
2308000	2309000	This is Adam Goldberg.
2309000	2310000	How's it going?
2310000	2312000	I got you a wedding thing for Aaron.
2312000	2313000	It's ace of spies.
2313000	2316000	It's a game fun.
2316000	2318000	What should I get Dan for his wedding?
2318000	2319000	Oh, I don't know.
2319000	2320000	Are you on the clock?
2320000	2322000	What's another game?
2322000	2323000	Shadow run.
2323000	2326000	I'm going to get Dan shadow run for his wedding.
2326000	2328000	Thanks for helping me figure that out.
2328000	2332000	For my wedding, if you get yourself shadow run and then you, we start to play in the
2332000	2335000	new year, we'll play shadow run on the podcast.
2335000	2338000	I feel like it'd just be easier if I got you shadow run.
2338000	2340000	And then I have to game master.
2340000	2341000	I don't know.
2341000	2343000	I just, you know, that's the end of it.
2343000	2346000	If I just gave it to you.
2346000	2347000	Thank you, Adam.
2347000	2348000	No worries.
2348000	2352000	Uh, so you came here with all, why do you have all your money with you?
2352000	2355000	That's the mystery here, right?
2355000	2358000	Well, when you leave Russia, you don't just leave stuff in Russia.
2358000	2363000	They have bank banks are capitalists.
2363000	2367000	They just have a big pile of their stuff in the center of the, I'm kidding.
2367000	2368000	I, I.
2368000	2370000	It's not true.
2370000	2374000	They, they, they, they converted to capitalism.
2379000	2386000	Our currency is falling down or rising up in some other way, like a premium.
2386000	2387000	Yeah,
2387000	2388000	even the currency is rising up.
2388000	2390000	Yeah.
2390000	2392000	Well, who's, ain't brother.
2393000	2395000	We gotta go to that Bitcoin business.
2395000	2398000	We gotta, we gotta, we gotta do some kind of Google money now.
2398000	2401000	What if you can mine Bitcoins in Minecraft?
2403000	2405000	Did I just make a million dollars?
2406000	2407000	Spencer, you gotta go.
2407000	2409000	You gotta get out of here, man.
2409000	2410000	You gotta get out of here right now.
2410000	2413000	I just start running like I have the golden ticket.
2414000	2415000	Out of my way.
2417000	2419000	I watched that Bitcoin documentary and still don't understand it.
2419000	2421000	But what I do understand is that it is inevitable.
2421000	2425000	It may not be Bitcoin, but obviously we have to go to some kind of peer to peer currency, right?
2425000	2427000	Well, haven't I explained this to you, Dan?
2427000	2428000	You have, but it's not.
2428000	2430000	It's a cash register full of math.
2430000	2431000	Yes, yes.
2432000	2433000	The way I always heard it.
2433000	2434000	It's so simple.
2434000	2441000	The way I always heard Bitcoin was if I gave you a Dave and Buster's dollar for every hour you spent idling your car.
2441000	2442000	It's like that, yes.
2442000	2447000	That's how much, that's how much the money is worth and how much electricity it actually costs to make.
2447000	2449000	Well, electricity, who cares?
2449000	2450000	Yeah, it's infinite.
2451000	2452000	Well, that's.
2454000	2462000	Yeah, well, I think at this point after watching this documentary, I think that any arguments for or against Bitcoin are kind of point.
2462000	2475000	It's sort of actually mute the larger conversation or realization should be that like MP3 technology, there is really nothing that's going to stop the nations of the world from inevitably.
2475000	2484000	If we if we continue to exchange any kind of currency, it's going to have to become a global kind of peer to peer currency.
2484000	2487000	There is no it's not because we're anarchists.
2487000	2493000	It's because the governments will not be able to sustain themselves while trying to endorse different kinds of currency.
2493000	2497000	They will one by one become incompatible with something that spreads.
2497000	2499000	I bet Adam disagrees with that.
2499000	2500000	I would.
2500000	2502000	I guess you know me well.
2502000	2509000	The thing about having a universal currency, it's a really big staple of sci fi, even in Shadowrun.
2509000	2519000	But the ability to issue debt from huge nations to huge nations means that having the yen and having the dollar be different things is really, really useful.
2519000	2532000	Well, if everything is like future bucks, then Japan can't control their exports and imports or set taxes that say this is valued internally as a currency and this is worth less as we export it.
2532000	2534000	I hear you there.
2534000	2535000	Definitely agree.
2535000	2536000	That's that.
2536000	2540000	I mean, in that I don't understand that shit at all.
2540000	2544000	And therefore, I definitely readily accept that it's impossible to take.
2544000	2549000	But but there's a difference between saying universal currency and peer to peer currency.
2549000	2558000	What's the difference between a dollar and a Bitcoin right now in terms of me being able to send it to you and you being able to send it to me, hopefully in a large amount.
2558000	2562000	There's a cash register made of math.
2562000	2563000	A cash register is made of math.
2563000	2567000	It takes one and then it turns it into one hundred of something else.
2567000	2569000	That's dollars and pennies.
2569000	2571000	Yeah, that's a cash register.
2571000	2576000	This is the most thrilling thing we should go back to talking about your dog who is so cute.
2576000	2578000	Is it a muppet dog?
2578000	2588000	Is it undignified or or embarrassing to admit in my position or not that I don't understand anything you guys are talking about?
2588000	2591000	I'd say that's that's a winning statement right there.
2591000	2593000	A lot of people are on your side.
2593000	2595000	I'm not trying. Yeah, I mean, if you don't. Yeah.
2595000	2597000	OK, so a couple of people also don't.
2597000	2598000	Good. That's cool.
2598000	2603000	Do you guys did you guys see Interstellar because I didn't.
2603000	2606000	That's a that's a movie you could see everywhere.
2606000	2607000	Yeah, no, I don't know.
2607000	2608000	I don't understand anything.
2608000	2616000	Not only do I not understand Bitcoin, I don't understand the actual American dollar or any kind of anything about economics worldwide.
2616000	2617000	OK, good.
2617000	2627000	So the thing that felt clear to me watching watching this documentary is that technology is going to affect currency as surely as it has affected culture.
2627000	2634000	Media of exchange like ideas, the way that we shoot things, edit things, record things.
2634000	2638000	They become peer to peer over time.
2638000	2647000	They transcend things as relatively vestigial as what country you live in over time.
2647000	2651000	It just seems like a safe enough bet.
2651000	2652000	I don't know.
2652000	2658000	There's nothing there's no risk at that bet because it's either 50 years or 500 years or five years from now and I don't know which it is.
2658000	2667000	But but we are we are tending toward we are going to end up not like going, oh, here's a picture of the queen on a piece of paper.
2667000	2675000	We're going to we're going to be sending each other blip blops under and they're going to be called one thing because I mean, I don't know.
2675000	2687000	I still think there's a skill difference because Channel 101 is the best this year as it's ever been in terms of cinematography, in terms of quality, in terms of people turning out half hour long finales to some of their series is like.
2687000	2697000	But there's still a difference between an episode of community and the finale of Fish Bowls are definitely my thing, which you should all watch because Fish Bowls is definitely my thing is fucking amazing.
2697000	2700000	And it tells you how the movie Seven ends.
2700000	2706000	Wow. All right. Adam Goldberg. You got to meet Adam Goldberg.
2706000	2709000	I did it. That was Adam Goldberg.
2709000	2715000	What did you think? Great guy, but he's not in the movie.
2715000	2719000	He's not in the movie for like a frame.
2719000	2722000	There is a shot of Adam Goldberg in the in the movie.
2722000	2724000	Yeah, he's reacting to something.
2724000	2729000	Have you also seen have you seen days in confused because that same actor is in.
2729000	2732000	Have you seen Richard Linklater's days of confused action?
2732000	2737000	No, it's like Adam Goldberg is like he's like pacing around the woods.
2737000	2740000	He's like dominant male monkey motherfucker.
2740000	2741000	And he's like pops his chest up.
2741000	2745000	He's wearing an army jacket. Anyway, you should check it out.
2745000	2749000	It's the same guy and he's got a new sitcom on ABC.
2749000	2752000	Is that the Goldbergs? Can I? Okay.
2752000	2758000	So the print ads of that show meet the Goldbergs like they in some of them,
2758000	2761000	they tried to do this thing where, oh, it's a bad picture.
2761000	2764000	We're bad at taking pictures. My eyes are closed during the picture.
2764000	2768000	But in some of the shots, they don't understand how eyelids work.
2768000	2773000	And the lower eyelid goes up way too far and it looks hideous like the reptile people.
2773000	2778000	And it's like, how do you couldn't just you ask the people to close their eyes for the photo.
2778000	2783000	You had to Photoshop these disgusting eyelids. I'm sorry.
2783000	2788000	You clearly haven't seen the show because it's about a family of reptile people.
2788000	2794000	Like, oh, my inner eyelid stuck again before the big dance.
2794000	2800000	My tail fell off. Is it going to regrow before photo picture day?
2800000	2802000	That was the finale last season. It was really good.
2802000	2804000	The photo picture day episode.
2804000	2805000	Photo picture day.
2806000	2809000	All right. New Zealand guy. Where's the New Zealand guy?
2809000	2811000	You want to come up here for a second?
2818000	2819000	What's your name? Matthew.
2819000	2821000	What brings you from New Zealand?
2821000	2824000	A bunch of TV stuff, actually.
2824000	2829000	I kind of went to a table reads of Family Guy and The Simpsons
2829000	2832000	and spent a day on the set of a couple of TV shows.
2832000	2833000	What for?
2833000	2834000	Because I like them.
2834000	2837000	You're just there as a fan?
2837000	2838000	Yeah.
2838000	2841000	They let you in? They just let you come in?
2841000	2843000	I actually did the same thing on Community last year.
2843000	2844000	Oh, yeah?
2844000	2845000	Yeah.
2845000	2848000	I won a charity auction to attend some of these things.
2848000	2850000	So, spent the money.
2850000	2860000	So, you're kind of loaded. You're down there in Kikiwe Town and you're sitting on some koalas.
2861000	2863000	As we call them.
2863000	2866000	They're a universal unit of currency in New Zealand.
2866000	2867000	Koala.
2867000	2868000	Yeah. Soon to be e-koalas.
2868000	2869000	Bit koala.
2870000	2878000	And you're like, oh, I could give this money. It'll go to charity and I can get close to my favorite shows.
2878000	2879000	That's nice.
2879000	2881000	How was your visit to Community?
2881000	2883000	It was really, really cool.
2883000	2887000	I actually got it on a scene on Season 5.
2887000	2889000	Oh, that's right. I think I've talked to you before, right?
2889000	2890000	Yeah, briefly.
2890000	2891000	Yeah.
2891000	2893000	All right. Now it's all coming back. More or less.
2893000	2895000	You want to come to my wedding?
2898000	2901000	No. Aaron will yell at me. I keep doing that.
2901000	2904000	I keep just going, hey, are you going to come to my wedding?
2906000	2909000	There's this seating chart. I can't do that.
2911000	2914000	So, what's better, Russia or New Zealand?
2915000	2917000	Are you guys proud of your countries?
2918000	2920000	Do you have patriotism where you come from?
2921000	2923000	We're pretty slack about it.
2923000	2928000	We are compared to Californians and Australians are compared to Texans.
2928000	2931000	The terms there are very Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.
2932000	2933000	I don't know.
2934000	2935000	But we live there.
2935000	2936000	Yeah.
2936000	2937000	That's about it.
2937000	2942000	Yeah. I actually can call myself Patrick, but...
2943000	2949000	Kings made some stupid decisions over the time.
2949000	2950000	Yeah.
2950000	2953000	You guys don't still have kings, though. We know that.
2958000	2961000	Well, I mean, how many terms has Putin been serving lately?
2961000	2963000	It's kind of like that, right?
2963000	2964000	He's trying to be a king.
2964000	2966000	Are you allowed to say, will he beat you up if he says so?
2966000	2967000	He will.
2968000	2970000	There are a lot of news articles about it.
2971000	2973000	I don't know. He's got my...
2974000	2978000	In Russian, does the word Putin...
2982000	2984000	Because it's kind of a...
2984000	2987000	You know what it is over here. He's farting.
2988000	2989000	He's cheating.
2990000	2992000	What are you doing over there, Vladimir?
2992000	2993000	I'm Putin!
2997000	2998000	You like that?
2999000	3001000	Is that funny in Russia?
3007000	3008000	Because it's not here.
3011000	3013000	I'm hoping to get into the export business.
3014000	3016000	I guess I'll never know.
3017000	3019000	After this show.
3022000	3024000	No, I don't judge it.
3025000	3028000	I still have Russia questions.
3038000	3039000	The alcoholism.
3040000	3043000	Yeah, that's a butt of all lives.
3048000	3049000	Why?
3050000	3053000	Because the stereotype is because of the weather.
3053000	3056000	It's just cold in Russia, so everybody drinks.
3056000	3058000	It seems a little oversimplified.
3059000	3062000	Yeah, it's actually more than that.
3063000	3064000	Yeah.
3066000	3067000	How much more?
3068000	3078000	Well, everyone is grumpy and don't want to rage against something.
3079000	3083000	He just wants to drink up, forget about things and don't.
3084000	3089000	So it's sad there? Is the implication there?
3090000	3094000	Or is it just with America's rich tradition of like, we have retail therapy.
3095000	3102000	When things are at their most culturally obtuse, you would see us buying the most pants ever.
3105000	3111000	There would be nine different cereals and there's like a CG bear going like, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, smack!
3115000	3118000	Everything's just kind of crazy in a consumer-y way.
3118000	3124000	And in Russia, I guess at the height of the Cold War, is what I'm describing.
3125000	3130000	When we were like, yeah, breakdance, got lots of Velcro, fuck Russia, boop, boop, boop.
3130000	3133000	I got seven kinds of toast, seven, seven, seven kinds of toast.
3133000	3137000	Caramel, bacon, M&M Skittles, way, way.
3140000	3142000	Those sound like great toasts.
3143000	3149000	It was more shit than you ever thought you needed while we were supposedly in a Cold War.
3149000	3155000	And then Russia was, at that same height, was like, the average Russian citizen was like,
3156000	3160000	they spent all my money combating those glow-in-the-dark pretzel commercials.
3160000	3163000	I'm going to just sit here in my cubicle and drink.
3165000	3170000	Because all of my money goes to missiles.
3172000	3175000	Researching Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
3176000	3180000	See if we can find a weakness in their plan.
3183000	3188000	Yeah, we had no money back then, basically.
3189000	3190000	So you drink?
3190000	3191000	Yeah.
3191000	3192000	Yeah.
3192000	3196000	And then the kids watch the parents drink, and then everybody drinks.
3196000	3197000	You just drink.
3198000	3200000	Something like that.
3201000	3204000	What was New Zealand doing during the Cold War?
3205000	3206000	Hanging out.
3206000	3207000	Hanging out.
3208000	3209000	Just being chill.
3209000	3211000	You guys don't have any missiles, do you?
3211000	3212000	No.
3212000	3213000	Do you have any missiles you could blow anyone up with?
3213000	3219000	Apparently, back in the 70s, the joke was that there were four people unemployed in the country,
3219000	3221000	and the Prime Minister knew them all by name.
3222000	3223000	Apparently, that's how it was.
3223000	3224000	What did you say?
3224000	3226000	There were four unemployed people in the country?
3226000	3228000	The Prime Minister knew them all by name?
3228000	3229000	Yes.
3229000	3230000	Oh, yeah.
3230000	3232000	Steve, get a job, Steve.
3233000	3234000	He tried.
3235000	3237000	The Prime Minister, I'm fine.
3237000	3238000	I'm sorry.
3238000	3240000	Get a job, Toby.
3241000	3243000	I know your mother.
3243000	3246000	It's not the country's problem.
3247000	3248000	You're lazy.
3249000	3251000	I've talked to your family.
3252000	3255000	I'm tired of pulling strings for you.
3256000	3259000	So, yeah, not quite the Cold War, but around that time,
3259000	3262000	and just infrastructure and things to be built.
3262000	3264000	So, that's awesome.
3265000	3269000	Could you swim to Australia from New Zealand?
3269000	3270000	Me, personally.
3273000	3274000	Could anyone?
3274000	3275000	Could a human being?
3275000	3276000	How big is it compared to like...
3276000	3277000	I think it's been done.
3277000	3278000	I think it's been done.
3278000	3279000	I'm not exactly sure.
3280000	3281000	Actually, probably not.
3281000	3282000	Probably not.
3282000	3283000	There could be a lot of sharks.
3283000	3284000	Sharks that just eat you.
3284000	3285000	That's for sharks most of the time.
3285000	3286000	Oh, yeah.
3286000	3289000	But don't they do all that sort of stuff with the cages and boats
3289000	3292000	and people swimming in the English Channel and stuff like that?
3292000	3293000	Yeah, well, the English Channel, yeah.
3293000	3297000	It's just small enough that you can like set a record
3297000	3299000	by doing some weird across it.
3301000	3303000	No one would ever think about doing it, but you can do it.
3303000	3305000	I was wondering how that compares to...
3305000	3308000	Probably a bit too far to go from New Zealand to Australia.
3308000	3312000	It would be about two hours flying time, so it's probably too far.
3313000	3314000	Yeah, that's a long...
3315000	3318000	That'd be like a day of swimming probably, right?
3319000	3320000	How do you feel about it?
3320000	3321000	It's so nice.
3321000	3323000	Are there spiders in Russia or New Zealand?
3324000	3325000	Spiders?
3325000	3326000	Black widows.
3326000	3327000	Brown recklessness.
3327000	3329000	There are red widows over there.
3330000	3335000	Not sure about black widows, but spiders are everywhere.
3338000	3341000	All right, so I'm going to try something really specific here.
3342000	3344000	All right, can you play a rap beat?
3344000	3346000	I don't have one, but I can beatbox.
3346000	3348000	Well, I think Zach might say that.
3348000	3349000	Zach will probably have a rap beat.
3349000	3351000	So when I point at you guys...
3351000	3352000	Sorry, you beatbox.
3352000	3353000	This is your part of the rap.
3353000	3354000	You don't have to...
3354000	3355000	Don't panic.
3355000	3356000	I can feel you panicking.
3357000	3360000	All you have to do, Eugene, is whenever I point at you,
3360000	3362000	you just say Russia.
3362000	3364000	That's all you have to do.
3364000	3366000	And you just have to say New Zealand.
3366000	3367000	I forgot your name already.
3367000	3368000	Matthew.
3368000	3369000	What's that?
3369000	3370000	Matthew.
3370000	3371000	Matthew.
3371000	3372000	New Zealand.
3372000	3373000	When I point at you...
3373000	3374000	I can probably handle that.
3374000	3375000	Eugene, you say Russia.
3375000	3378000	All right, and if you have a rap beat, okay.
3382000	3383000	Yeah.
3383000	3384000	Yeah.
3384000	3385000	Oh.
3385000	3386000	Yeah.
3386000	3387000	Yeah.
3389000	3390000	Yeah.
3390000	3391000	Oh.
3391000	3392000	Yeah.
3392000	3393000	Yeah.
3393000	3394000	Yeah.
3394000	3395000	Nation to nation.
3395000	3396000	Which nation is best?
3396000	3398000	The ones in north, south, east, or west.
3398000	3401000	I'm gonna compare nations and rap about them to you.
3402000	3404000	Fuck your mama with a shoe.
3406000	3407000	Yeah.
3408000	3409000	Yeah.
3409000	3410000	Yeah.
3410000	3411000	Yeah.
3411000	3412000	Yeah.
3412000	3413000	Russia.
3413000	3415000	Russia's the best.
3415000	3417000	Fuck your mama all the way to the west.
3418000	3419000	Thank you.
3422000	3423000	Yeah.
3423000	3425000	Yo, Russia got Lenin's tomb.
3425000	3427000	But fuck your mama so hard,
3427000	3428000	she ruptured a womb.
3428000	3429000	I'm sorry.
3431000	3432000	Yo.
3433000	3434000	Yeah.
3434000	3437000	Fuck your mama up and down Red Square.
3437000	3439000	Fuck your mama at the county fair.
3439000	3442000	Fuck your mama outside of the Kremlin.
3442000	3445000	Sold your mama's pussy like it was a gremlin
3445000	3447000	in a Chinese shop.
3447000	3450000	A curiosity's get a mop.
3450000	3452000	Don't get water on his back.
3452000	3455000	He's gonna reproduce and then he'll attack.
3455000	3458000	Don't feed him after midnight or they'll turn bad.
3458000	3459000	New Zealand.
3460000	3461000	Yeah.
3463000	3464000	Yeah.
3464000	3465000	Yeah.
3465000	3466000	Yeah.
3466000	3468000	New Zealand is the place to be.
3468000	3471000	It's on the top of Australia, you see.
3471000	3474000	You got less kangaroos up there
3474000	3477000	because they can't make the hop and they got thick hair.
3478000	3479000	Yo.
3482000	3483000	New Zealand.
3485000	3487000	Located atop the River Ganges,
3487000	3492000	the New Zealand island is populated primarily by criminals.
3493000	3494000	Criminals.
3495000	3496000	Russia.
3497000	3498000	Alcohol.
3499000	3502000	Located east of the River Gaches,
3503000	3507000	the Soviet Union is now known as the Soviet Republic, sir.
3507000	3510000	Taxes, taxes, no new taxes.
3511000	3512000	New Zealand.
3513000	3514000	Russia.
3516000	3517000	New Zealand.
3519000	3520000	Russia.
3524000	3525000	New Zealand.
3526000	3527000	New Zealand.
3529000	3530000	New Zealand.
3532000	3533000	Russia.
3533000	3534000	Russia.
3534000	3535000	Russia.
3540000	3541000	All right.
3541000	3542000	Yeah.
3542000	3543000	Okay.
3543000	3544000	That's good.
3544000	3545000	That's been there.
3545000	3546000	That bit.
3548000	3551000	Thank you Eugene and Matthew for our international guest.
3557000	3559000	You guys can take a seat.
3559000	3563000	Unless there's anything that you provided us with so much,
3563000	3566000	is there anything that while you're here you've traveled a long way?
3566000	3567000	Yeah.
3567000	3569000	I traveled to ask you one question.
3569000	3570000	Oh, yeah.
3570000	3571000	God.
3571000	3573000	I can't believe we almost lost you.
3574000	3575000	Yeah.
3575000	3576000	That slipped your mind.
3579000	3581000	All my belongings in my backpack.
3581000	3584000	I saw Joel McHale in an illegal BitTorrent.
3584000	3586000	I made it here.
3586000	3589000	But then you did that rap and it was so funny.
3590000	3591000	See you later.
3591000	3592000	All right.
3592000	3593000	What's your question?
3593000	3594000	You have the floor.
3595000	3599000	If you woke up on an island one day
3599000	3606000	and all you had is a cloning machine that could make instant clones of yourself,
3606000	3607000	what would we do?
3608000	3609000	Please do.
3628000	3634000	Because among the possibilities and among some of the necessities are,
3634000	3636000	you might have to eat yourself.
3640000	3643000	And you might want to fuck yourself.
3645000	3646000	My way too.
3646000	3650000	And any of yourselves might want to kill you for fucking and eating you.
3653000	3656000	Are the clones, do they have my mind?
3656000	3657000	Do all my memories?
3657000	3662000	Or are they just biologically me and they come out kind of like new to the world
3662000	3663000	and I get to teach them English or not?
3663000	3668000	No, actually they complete copy of you the memories.
3668000	3673000	So they just come out and go like, oh, hey, I'm not a copy.
3674000	3675000	Yeah.
3675000	3676000	Like, yeah, you are.
3676000	3678000	You just came out of the copy machine.
3679000	3680000	Okay.
3680000	3684000	Well, so you needed a friend and I'm like, no, I'm hungry.
3687000	3690000	Like you'd have to like, I mean, I'm assuming like,
3691000	3694000	hide right by with a, with a baseball bat.
3695000	3700000	You just have this device, like this two by four that would come down with a nail on it.
3700000	3702000	Just make a mob grinder like a Minecraft.
3702000	3703000	Yeah.
3703000	3704000	Minecraft mob grinder.
3704000	3705000	Yeah.
3705000	3708000	You would hang the cloning machine over a pit of spikes.
3710000	3717000	Just hang it, hang it facing down so that it is shot down like a kitchen faucet.
3718000	3725000	And then there's two, two early clones that you, that you enslaved and hired to drag the corpses.
3727000	3733000	And they know they get 20% of the corpses because you have pretended there's a bunch of you up there
3736000	3740000	by taking previous clones, dead bodies and kind of puppeting them.
3741000	3744000	So they think there's a whole society up there and that they did something wrong.
3745000	3755000	So if they, if they, if they keep hauling corpses and cleaning and cooking them and passing the meat up through the dumb waiter, they get, they get an arm.
3759000	3762000	This is actually what that TV series, the illusionist is about.
3763000	3765000	Yeah, the illusionist.
3766000	3772000	Well, I mean, can I ask what have you thought about this, what you would do or is this just a question to make people sad?
3775000	3788000	Actually, I wanted to hear your question because I had something in my mind, like, yes, killing myself, making a boat of my skin and bones.
3788000	3789000	I went there.
3795000	3801000	This is not the time or the place to judge people for the question is, what would you do?
3802000	3805000	Not, can you impress us with your lying?
3809000	3812000	Did you say you'd make weapons or clothes?
3812000	3813000	No, a boat.
3813000	3814000	A boat?
3814000	3815000	A boat.
3815000	3816000	Oh, to get off the island.
3818000	3819000	Yeah.
3822000	3824000	Meanwhile, in Portland, and they're like, what?
3825000	3837000	They got something out here and it's just this giant, cured human flesh, cartilage, Cronenbergian-fucking vessel, you rowing a femur.
3839000	3840000	Oh, my God, man.
3847000	3852000	But don't you think that you could make enough of you and then say, huddle up, everybody.
3852000	3853000	Come on.
3853000	3854000	How many time?
3854000	3856000	You can get dressed in a second.
3857000	3858000	Here's the situation.
3858000	3859000	No food.
3859000	3860000	No water.
3860000	3861000	Desert island.
3861000	3863000	Just made a ton of mouths to feed.
3863000	3864000	We got to split up.
3864000	3865000	Let's fucking do this.
3865000	3867000	Let's turn this place into Miami.
3867000	3869000	Like, get out there.
3869000	3871000	Sharpen, sharpen, start sharpening sticks.
3871000	3873000	You hand the sharp sticks to him.
3873000	3874000	You get some wild boar.
3874000	3879000	I want you to start punching grass and plants and see if any seeds come out.
3879000	3882000	Again, all my survivalist knowledge is based on Minecraft.
3882000	3883000	It's useful.
3883000	3888000	If you punch enough grass, doesn't the seed come out that you can use to make food eventually?
3888000	3891000	Punch one log, then make a crafting table.
3891000	3902000	But you could, or with that automatically, it would be like, no way, because the whole point of a biomass is that if it's gotten that big, it's because it was sustainable.
3903000	3910000	There's no way you could drop 50 strangers on an island and expect more than 20 of them to be alive three days later.
3910000	3911000	Yeah, probably.
3911000	3916000	Could you make 20 of you and then be like, all right, guys, huddle up.
3916000	3920000	Listen, I know we don't have any food, but I'm going to make one more of me, and we're all going to eat that one.
3922000	3923000	I feel like that could work.
3923000	3924000	Yeah, that's what you do.
3924000	3931000	Is this a one shot only you make however many you make, and then the cloning machine's broken, or can you make food people?
3933000	3934000	For lack of a better word.
3935000	3936000	Actually, I thought about it.
3937000	3940000	You can make as much as you like.
3940000	3941000	Oh, perfect.
3941000	3942000	So you can eat a bunch of them.
3942000	3943000	It's a meat machine.
3943000	3961000	But I feel like if I had a choice between, and I do in this hypothesis, I have a choice, between making 20 of me and saying, let's all ritualistically eat into new people who are no different from any of us except that they're 21st.
3962000	3963000	Yeah.
3963000	3964000	They're late.
3964000	3965000	It's just bad for morale.
3965000	3970000	It's just like everyone's at the table going, are you going to finish that toe?
3970000	3972000	And they're like, this is great.
3972000	3974000	Me is great.
3974000	3979000	And everyone's like, yeah, we're so lucky to be given this bounty.
3979000	3980000	What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
3980000	3984000	Well, let's press the button again and do this again.
3984000	3990000	And everyone would just have this kind of podcast over them where they're like, well, what's the point?
3990000	3996000	Whereas if you just take things in your own hands and are like, I'm a maniac.
3996000	3999000	I control this machine.
3999000	4000000	I'm going to control the food chain.
4000000	4012000	I'm going to position myself as like a god and create a new civilization underneath me in which I don't have to deal with the psychological ramifications of life and death.
4012000	4016000	I simply am somehow I'm passed meat up.
4016000	4017000	Like it's already cooked even.
4017000	4019000	I can't even recognize it.
4019000	4020000	I'll start to convince myself.
4020000	4025000	I'll just I'll bury the lip of the machine so that all I do is hit a button.
4025000	4029000	And I slowly forget that it's me coming out of it.
4029000	4044000	And I just like every day I go to like a bamboo cabinet and I open it and a fresh steaming pile of me is delicately prepared by the best chef version of me because it's just because I'm just I'm I'm Sumner Redstone.
4044000	4047000	Like I'm just like I don't even touch the things I control.
4047000	4055000	I just like there's just layers of fucking like metropolis is down there.
4055000	4059000	Sorry you just compared yourself to this CEO of Viacom.
4059000	4063000	I'm just saying like what you're like like like like those guys like those.
4063000	4065000	They don't even know I get it.
4065000	4067000	I don't know what's happening on Comedy Central.
4067000	4068000	I'm talking to VH1 today.
4068000	4069000	Yeah.
4069000	4070000	What you're saying is I don't know.
4070000	4071000	I guess it's I guess that's me.
4071000	4072000	I'm just pressing a button.
4072000	4073000	Yeah.
4073000	4074000	I buried my machine underground.
4074000	4076000	You could easily just like forget about it.
4076000	4081000	I believe I believe in a way we have all done this.
4081000	4087000	That bamboo cabinet is called America.
4087000	4094000	That button is called your taxes.
4094000	4100000	You're a genius.
4100000	4102000	Thank you Eugene.
4102000	4110000	Congratulations on a successful pilgrimage.
4110000	4114000	Everything all his steps in that backpack.
4114000	4119000	I mean this isn't hilarious but you guys didn't go with what I would have done
4119000	4123000	which I don't even know if this is a good idea but some species of ants have
4123000	4128000	evolved a way of surviving floods by which they all form together in a giant
4128000	4132000	ant ball and they slowly spin the water.
4132000	4134000	Each person gets a turn to breathe.
4134000	4140000	I think I might do that.
4140000	4143000	All right other Spencer's listen up for a little while.
4143000	4144000	You're going to be underwater.
4144000	4146000	It's going to suck but then we're going to rotate.
4146000	4147000	But guess what?
4147000	4151000	If this doesn't work I'm leaving a retainer clone to try something else.
4151000	4155000	It's really funny when you picture them all as Spencer's anyway.
4155000	4157000	All right Spencer listen up.
4157000	4161000	Okay so here's how it's going to be and they're already getting involved.
4161000	4162000	I know we all like breathing.
4162000	4165000	Uh-huh yeah uh-huh okay yeah.
4165000	4169000	And then there's just a shot of all of the...
4169000	4173000	Just completely solemn coming out of the above the waves.
4173000	4178000	The Duran Duran rough boys video where they're like coming out of the water
4178000	4183000	and I'll splash this water coming off the face.
4183000	4186000	And you leave behind one Spencer who's on the shore like yep if this fucks up
4186000	4188000	I'll just make a bunch of new ones.
4188000	4192000	We'll try plan bridge of humans.
4192000	4195000	That's what I thought you were going to say that ants like they kill themselves
4195000	4198000	and lay down across the water and then other ants walk across their deck.
4198000	4204000	Ant ball requires no sacrifices my friends.
4204000	4205000	Ant ball.
4205000	4206000	Ant ball.
4206000	4210000	Speaking of arthropods uh just I want to cycle.
4210000	4213000	I want to cycle back around to spiders real quick.
4213000	4217000	If you put you know how like you can see cats eyes glowing in the dark.
4217000	4219000	Spiders eyes do that too to a lesser extent.
4219000	4224000	If you put in a light right by your eyes so it's like right in line with your eyes.
4224000	4227000	So like if you take your phone and have the phone flashlight right up to your eye
4227000	4231000	and you look out into the darkness like in a bush you can see these little tiny
4231000	4237000	they almost just look like glitter among the among the shadows and those are spiders eyes.
4238000	4241000	I listen to podcasts bro.
4241000	4243000	I know all sorts of shit.
4243000	4245000	Have you tested it?
4245000	4249000	Yeah it's terrifying.
4249000	4254000	Like don't don't actually do it you'll shit.
4254000	4257000	I know we were talking about spiders once.
4257000	4260000	I missed I missed it back then.
4260000	4263000	What do you think it is about spiders that are so extra terrifying?
4263000	4269000	Well humans actually actually the the racism psychologists that we talked to in Chicago was talking about
4269000	4274000	humans actually have this evolutionary almost like a flash card of snakes and spiders
4274000	4276000	that's like these are terrifying.
4276000	4277000	Is it because they're venomous?
4277000	4282000	Yeah probably just because stuff like that is a lot more instantaneous of a death.
4282000	4287000	It's not like a coyote or something where you can learn tactics to combat it.
4288000	4290000	I think that's got it.
4290000	4293000	That was a that was a smooth plug.
4293000	4294000	Very subtle.
4294000	4295000	It's it's true though.
4295000	4303000	It's like there's a lot of animals we can't actually just you know combat but you can't punch a spider if a spider bites you once you're you're potentially dead.
4303000	4306000	Yeah I think that's that probably is what it is.
4306000	4312000	Yeah if you like if you live with poison inside of you that you can it'll leave your body.
4312000	4315000	Like if I if I knew that I could.
4316000	4324000	If I knew that I poisoned inside me and I could just be like hey fuck you like like in a bar fight like fuck you man.
4324000	4327000	Like that's crazy power.
4327000	4333000	All I have is like my like impotent rage like that's not that's not that's not terrifying.
4333000	4339000	You would you you would use poison if you if I don't know man it's almost that's my girl.
4339000	4340000	Whatever.
4344000	4346000	You're gonna fucking step to me.
4346000	4347000	I'm full of poison.
4347000	4349000	I got a reserve of it.
4349000	4350000	It lives in me.
4350000	4352000	If I'm mad enough it's out.
4352000	4354000	That's what it's for.
4354000	4356000	Do you know if you would ever use it.
4356000	4357000	I don't know.
4357000	4358000	No.
4358000	4361000	Well I can't think of a situation in which I would use it recently.
4361000	4363000	Well you would.
4363000	4365000	If someone steps to my girl.
4365000	4367000	I think I think we all.
4368000	4370000	Like you guys are at Aria in Hollywood.
4370000	4374000	You're dancing on a Saturday night with your girl like you are want to do.
4374000	4376000	And I know you.
4376000	4379000	You got a real wide collar unbuttoned to the chest.
4379000	4380000	You're dancing.
4380000	4382000	A dude comes up to you.
4382000	4385000	He pretends like you're not even there.
4385000	4387000	He's getting all up on your girl.
4387000	4390000	You're bribed to be dog.
4390000	4396000	Now mind you you've got a you've got a reserve of poison that venom is like ready to.
4396000	4397000	What happens.
4397000	4403000	Do you just go like hey man maybe maybe like just maybe just go to a different table or do you go.
4403000	4404000	I.
4404000	4414000	Well first I would go like I better watch what Aaron does in this situation because this might be how I find out she doesn't love me.
4414000	4416000	And then your poison stays put in your.
4416000	4419000	Yeah I mean why will far be it for me to poison this guy.
4419000	4423000	He's he's he's you know going to be her new.
4424000	4426000	This is how they meet.
4426000	4437000	I think that's what separates us from the snakes because snakes can't just like Uber to Carl's Junior and like you know get like a six dollar guacamole bacon burger go home.
4437000	4440000	Well this venom would be a rescue.
4440000	4443000	Would you be immune to your own venom.
4443000	4444000	You have to be.
4444000	4451000	OK so like you could go up to someone who's like eating a sandwich and spit poison on it and feel like hey man that's going to kill you.
4451000	4456000	Can I have that just all the free food.
4456000	4459000	You can just ruin people's days.
4459000	4460000	Poison.
4460000	4464000	It's all about you stealing people's free sandwiches.
4464000	4466000	Oh I poison your slurpee bro.
4466000	4468000	Hey you can't drink that can I have it.
4468000	4477000	But you know technically you can do that with your regular spit or regular non-extreated poison.
4477000	4480000	Yeah hey that's not gross to me man can I have that.
4481000	4485000	Well I feel like if you're a venomous creature you might get more of a pass.
4485000	4491000	You know it's like if you spin something people would be like they'd punch you but not if you are a venomous creature.
4491000	4492000	But they still would.
4492000	4497000	They could punch you and like leave you at the side like on a sidewalk but they still wouldn't drink their slurpee.
4497000	4502000	So you'd have a black eye but then you'd also have like a large slurpee with your name on it.
4502000	4508000	Well we just cut out the very complicated middleman of a very complex problem.
4508000	4509000	So I'm glad.
4509000	4511000	Did you see a hard target.
4511000	4515000	Jean-Claude Van Damme punches a snake in it.
4515000	4517000	How does that go.
4517000	4525000	He grabs a snake it's going to bite the woman and then he grabs it and then he holds it and the camera is over the snake's shoulder.
4525000	4532000	As Jean-Claude Van Damme goes and the snake passes out.
4532000	4534000	He knocks it out.
4534000	4535000	I got to see it.
4535000	4539000	I'm obsessed with the scene. Have you seen the beach with Leonardo DiCaprio.
4539000	4540000	No.
4540000	4552000	He punches a shark in the face and that and it's like the greatest thing I've ever seen because then there's a scene where he's telling that story to a bunch of people on a beach as if as if they're like us watching the movie.
4552000	4555000	And he's like and then I decided that I will not die tonight.
4555000	4559000	And everyone's like yeah I guess you punched a shark.
4559000	4561000	Sort of impressed.
4561000	4568000	Is that the scene because I remember seeing a trailer where I just see Leo DiCaprio going like this in the trailer.
4568000	4572000	Is that him like hallucinating his life is like a video game.
4572000	4574000	It's not the best movie.
4574000	4576000	I got to see this thing.
4576000	4577000	Yeah you should probably see it.
4577000	4580000	Isn't what's his name from Last Action Hero in that.
4580000	4589000	Isn't there like an old crazy old man that's keeping him prisoner on the island or am I thinking of you might be thinking of Last Action Hero or Dr. Moreau.
4589000	4590000	Shutter.
4590000	4591000	Shutter.
4591000	4592000	Well not Shutter Island.
4592000	4599000	I saw that little little steaming little surprise in the theater.
4599000	4601000	They love that little reveal in Shutter.
4601000	4604000	Has everyone seen Shutter Island.
4604000	4606000	Yeah I don't.
4606000	4612000	I mean it's like it's it's the world's worst crying game.
4612000	4615000	I mean you would be you would.
4615000	4616000	Yeah.
4616000	4624000	Are there are there movies that have a twist that big that make you go like I like that you get really excited about because sometimes I just feel like I don't like that people are fucking with me.
4624000	4625000	But maybe I'm just too fragile.
4625000	4629000	I don't think that's I mean our brains and our bodies are six million years old.
4629000	4636000	There's no there's no such thing as like a there's twists in storytelling but you can't just say at the end of a campfire story.
4636000	4641000	But by the way this whole time they were in a hat.
4641000	4643000	They were all really tiny.
4643000	4645000	And you're like oh.
4645000	4646000	Yeah.
4646000	4647000	Like you just do.
4647000	4651000	The whole time I was telling you that Bruce Willis was hanging out with this kid.
4651000	4652000	Guess what.
4652000	4654000	He was a ghost.
4654000	4656000	I didn't say anyone else could see him.
4656000	4658000	What.
4658000	4660000	Check out a bunch of flashbacks motherfucker.
4660000	4661000	What are you.
4661000	4662000	Flashbacks.
4662000	4663000	It's a campfire.
4663000	4664000	Yeah.
4664000	4665000	I think you get it.
4665000	4670000	I mean so I mean make your movie however you want but.
4670000	4671000	I will.
4671000	4674000	I'm going to make my movie and there's going to be so many twists.
4674000	4677000	Tell this old timer a story.
4677000	4679000	For instance horns.
4679000	4680000	Did you watch horns.
4680000	4682000	I just watched horns.
4682000	4685000	I drove past the theater that was playing horns 10 times.
4685000	4691000	And I feel like if I did it one more time I would have gone in because that poster of old cutie little Daniel Radcliffe with horns.
4691000	4693000	That's almost enough man.
4693000	4694000	I don't even know what it's about.
4694000	4695000	Why does he have horns.
4695000	4697000	That's what it's about.
4697000	4698000	Then he has horns.
4698000	4699000	Yeah.
4699000	4700000	Why.
4700000	4701000	And why.
4701000	4702000	Yeah.
4702000	4703000	Did you see it.
4703000	4704000	No.
4704000	4708000	I watched it.
4708000	4709000	What do you think.
4709000	4721000	It's like you know old crudite because it's kind of dry and ashy.
4721000	4726000	Supposed to be good for me but it's just like from Albert since.
4726000	4737000	Like why are you trying to make me rethink how I think about morality when you don't even know what your movies about.
4737000	4738000	Like why.
4738000	4739000	Why.
4739000	4747000	Why are we going straight to me having my definitions of good and bad subverted if like you know you know.
4747000	4751000	I hate when crudite makes me think that I don't know.
4751000	4752000	I'm too old.
4752000	4753000	I just want.
4753000	4756000	I just watch these things now and I just I feel like it just everyone's on my lawn.
4756000	4758000	I just go like get off my lawn.
4758000	4760000	There's another movie to get off my lawn.
4760000	4764000	Like I kind of like don't even consider it their good their goal to entertain me anymore.
4764000	4768000	I just like go six dollars six dollars.
4768000	4769000	OK.
4769000	4770000	What do we got here.
4770000	4771000	He's fast.
4771000	4772000	He's furious.
4772000	4778000	Make up your mind.
4778000	4786000	It's not for me and I kind of like therefore I'm kind of like it's like I actually don't.
4786000	4790000	I can't tell you in the old days like eight years ago I would have been like horns.
4790000	4793000	I'll tell you what I thought about horns.
4793000	4803000	I'd be like angry about it because underneath that anger would be some supposition that it's possible to make a good movie or that or that or that you know like RoboCop was so great.
4803000	4807000	You know it's just like I'm just 41 in my back hurts and I'm kind of like I think all these movies suck.
4807000	4809000	I think they've always sucked.
4809000	4813000	I think everything is always sucked way more than we think.
4813000	4816000	And you're just catching some sucky shit when you're in a good mood.
4816000	4817000	You're like I'm 11.
4817000	4820000	Star Wars is amazing.
4820000	4824000	I mean I was like you're not wrong but also have you seen Birdman.
4824000	4826000	I haven't seen Birdman.
4826000	4829000	I want to see people think it's done.
4829000	4836000	I saw the trailer for it and I was like I don't think I'm going to be able to handle watching that because it's just because Michael Keaton's too much for the average current movie.
4836000	4839000	Going audience because he's too fucking good.
4839000	4842000	He's back.
4842000	4847000	Anyone in here doesn't think he's back.
4847000	4848000	Who honestly.
4848000	4849000	I don't know.
4849000	4850000	I'm sorry.
4850000	4851000	I'm sorry to do this by show of applause.
4851000	4853000	If anyone doesn't think he's back.
4853000	4856000	Speak now.
4856000	4860000	A week applause that I will not dignify with a response.
4860000	4861000	He's back.
4861000	4862000	He's back.
4862000	4863000	All right.
4863000	4864000	Michael Keaton's back.
4864000	4865000	He's back.
4865000	4871000	I mean it's just a real fucking treat to watch that guy for two hours after like a million years of not seeing him for two hours.
4871000	4873000	You get you get him for two hours.
4873000	4878000	I guess I have I guess I wasn't I didn't realize how that I hadn't seen Michael Keaton for a while.
4878000	4885000	You forget but then you see it in a movie theater and you realize like I've been watching a bunch of guys named white guys named Chris for like the last 10.
4885000	4891000	Who the fuck are these guys with like cool hair or not Paul Rogan.
4891000	4892000	Yeah.
4892000	4893000	Greg Phillips.
4893000	4894000	Yeah.
4894000	4895000	Yeah.
4895000	4897000	Like Ripley Cooper do like oh my God.
4897000	4898000	Right.
4898000	4899000	Right.
4899000	4900000	That's right.
4900000	4901000	Zach Bergen Bergen.
4901000	4906000	A bunch of guys who have like cool abs and they have faces and they like can't act the way out of a paper bag and they're driving a cool car.
4906000	4908000	You're like I guess this is a cool movie.
4908000	4912000	Fucking Keaton is here for you here for you.
4912000	4914000	And I'm not fucking around.
4914000	4917000	It's like people think I'm joking.
4918000	4921000	Listen listen listen listen and I will show I promise I'll shut up.
4921000	4922000	It's your show.
4922000	4930000	But guys Beetlejuice does not appear in his own movie for 50 minutes.
4930000	4932000	50 minutes into Beetlejuice.
4932000	4934000	He shows up for real earlier in the movie.
4934000	4936000	He's like on a commercial on a tiny TV.
4936000	4938000	He's like I mean look at me.
4938000	4939000	50 minutes.
4939000	4942000	He comes in for real and takes the movie over.
4942000	4944000	Nobody remembers that because he fucking owns it.
4944000	4946000	Because he's Keaton.
4946000	4948000	He's Keaton.
4948000	4950000	I'll tell you something else.
4950000	4955000	Gina Davis was an almost Olympic archer.
4955000	4956000	Did you know that?
4956000	4957000	Oh I know.
4957000	4958000	Google it.
4958000	4961000	Gina Davis almost was in the Olympics as an archer.
4961000	4962000	She was almost an Olympic archer.
4962000	4967000	She was in Beetlejuice and she had a sitcom where she played the president.
4967000	4971000	And I have no opinion about any of that stuff but I think it's interesting.
4971000	4973000	No yeah I don't think she's a good or bad person.
4973000	4974000	I just think it's amazing.
4974000	4982000	Post Gina Davis the actor, Gina Davis might have been representing the United States as an archer in the Olympics.
4982000	4986000	That's impressive to me because to be good at more than one thing it really eludes me.
4986000	4988000	Because I'm not even good at one thing.
4988000	4995000	Obviously she's got to be a pretty shitty archer because how many people can possibly be trying out for that?
4995000	4999000	Since the invention of the gun.
4999000	5003000	Raise your hand if you can kill someone with a bow and arrow.
5003000	5007000	Someone's iffy on it.
5007000	5010000	You could maim them like maybe draw a bunch of blood.
5010000	5013000	I did like 15 years ago so I don't know anymore.
5013000	5017000	You maimed someone or you practiced archery?
5017000	5027000	I shot an arrow at a Ren fair two years ago and I did not come close to a target or I shot at a bale of hay and I missed.
5027000	5036000	Alright we don't have an ending for the show because it's not because Spencer is a bad person.
5036000	5040000	It's because we've grown over dependent on Dungeons and Dragons as a closer.
5040000	5042000	And yet the show has no structure anymore.
5042000	5053000	There's no like Jeff's been on sabbatical for so long and you know to ask you to keep writing these D&D adventurettes.
5053000	5057000	I mean I wrote them but yeah I mean it's tough.
5057000	5058000	It's a tough ass.
5058000	5061000	But the show has got a it's got a Dungeons and Dragons addiction.
5061000	5065000	I mean we we don't know how else to end the show.
5065000	5066000	I feel like I know how.
5066000	5072000	Ladies and gentlemen Michael Keating.
5072000	5073000	Keep the applause.
5073000	5074000	He's coming.
5074000	5076000	He's slower.
5076000	5078000	It didn't work.
5078000	5080000	But but honestly what if.
5080000	5081000	What if.
5081000	5082000	What if.
5082000	5083000	It could happen man.
5083000	5085000	It would blow minds.
5085000	5087000	And I know that.
5087000	5090000	And that's what makes you think Keating's back.
5090000	5092000	Keating's back man.
5092000	5093000	I'm sorry Dan.
5093000	5094000	No it's all right.
5094000	5095000	Okay.
5095000	5098000	Well so I mean you were talking a bunch of where were you going with all that.
5098000	5099000	No I'm.
5099000	5100000	Some interesting talk.
5100000	5101000	I'm just floundering.
5101000	5102000	I'm just sharing my anxiety.
5102000	5103000	Oh.
5103000	5104000	I don't script the show.
5104000	5107000	I don't know if I if I prepared things do you think I'd talk about my dog.
5107000	5109000	Yeah I think your dog is.
5109000	5110000	I'm not Bill Cosby.
5110000	5111000	I didn't go.
5111000	5112000	Oh my dog will be interesting.
5112000	5113000	I'll do a take 20 about that.
5113000	5114000	And fuck Bill Cosby.
5114000	5115000	I don't know.
5115000	5116000	Everybody look.
5116000	5125000	People are going to start being okay when talking about fuck Bill Cosby.
5125000	5126000	Yeah.
5126000	5127000	I mean.
5127000	5130000	I know that one person's week applies.
5130000	5131000	Yeah.
5131000	5134000	People were way happier about Beetlejuice not showing up for 50 minutes and they were about
5134000	5137000	talking about Bill Cosby.
5137000	5138000	Nobody here knows him.
5138000	5139000	He did it.
5139000	5140000	Yeah.
5140000	5141000	No.
5141000	5142000	I mean that's it.
5142000	5143000	You're all wrong.
5143000	5144000	You're all wrong.
5144000	5146000	He's not actually your dad.
5146000	5148000	He just played a dad on TV.
5148000	5149000	It's okay.
5149000	5150000	It's okay.
5150000	5153000	Danny did it.
5153000	5154000	I know.
5154000	5155000	I know.
5155000	5156000	I know.
5156000	5157000	I remember.
5157000	5159000	We all know.
5159000	5160000	Let me.
5160000	5161000	Let me.
5161000	5162000	Let me just do it.
5162000	5163000	Let me do a really sweet ass rap.
5163000	5164000	Like.
5164000	5165000	Like I won't.
5165000	5166000	But it doesn't necessarily.
5166000	5167000	It's not going to close the show.
5167000	5168000	The rap.
5168000	5169000	Just let me clear my head.
5169000	5170000	But could it.
5170000	5171000	Sorry.
5171000	5172000	Sorry.
5172000	5173000	It's not my job.
5173000	5174000	No.
5174000	5175000	Of course.
5175000	5176000	My job is to flow.
5176000	5177000	To clear your head.
5177000	5178000	This is serious shit.
5178000	5184000	I don't know what I'm doing up here.
5184000	5185000	Dan Harmon motherfuckers.
5185000	5186000	Yeah.

5200000	5202000	She uses them to walk.
5202000	5207000	Cooked a pussy like a walk.
5207000	5209000	Chinese food.
5209000	5214000	You're mama's in the mood.
5214000	5216000	Chops sticks.

5245000	5247000	I'm breaking it down.
5247000	5250000	Like a sad clown.
5250000	5253000	Because I'm stepping up the place with my jungle and balls.
5253000	5257000	And I'm screaming to the place from the walls to the walls.
5257000	5258000	I don't know.

5270000	5273000	Fuck your mama with a thimble.
5273000	5275000	Because my pinky's so small.
5275000	5278000	Don't want her to poke it at all.
5278000	5283000	So I protect it with a sewing piece of equipment.

5311000	5313000	And now I'm about to begin.
5313000	5315000	My name is Dave.
5315000	5317000	And I don't rap a lot.
5317000	5318000	Yo.
5318000	5319000	I smoke a little pot.
5319000	5320000	And that's cool.
5320000	5322000	It's decriminalized.
5322000	5323000	Girl.
5323000	5324000	I'm between your thighs.
5324000	5325000	That's cool.
5325000	5327000	I rap about Keaton.
5327000	5330000	Motherfucker Jodi Sweeten.
5330000	5333000	Coming back from a meth addiction.
