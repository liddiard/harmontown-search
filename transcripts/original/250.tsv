0	13000	Ladies and gentlemen, from beautiful uptown, Burbank-Harmon Town is now in session.
19000	23000	Let's welcome to the stage the Game Master Spencer Crittenden.
23000	33000	And your mayor of Harbontown, Dan Harmon.
38000	41000	Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out.
41000	48000	It's a holiday weekend. We check in for granted that we keep filling this place, but we've got this venue now,
48000	53000	and it's like, it's not easy to get people over here. It's Burbank.
53000	59000	So all these people that keep filling the joint, they're obviously, we could probably do anything.
59000	62000	We got them on the hook.
62000	66000	Who drove really far, like from L.A.? How far did you come from?
66000	67000	Minnesota.
67000	71000	You drove from Minnesota? See, now that's a hell of a drive.
71000	73000	Yeah, that's a lot harder.
73000	76000	You must have left like this morning.
77000	82000	Yeah, who wants to go to Burbank from Minnesota? That's crazy.
82000	84000	What part of Minnesota are you from?
84000	85000	The Twin Cities.
85000	88000	The Twin Cities. Which ones?
88000	90000	I'm kidding, of course.
90000	92000	Hello, Dan. How are you doing, man?
92000	93000	I'm good, I'm good.
93000	95000	You seem like you've got something on your mind.
95000	98000	Well, no, I'm just trying to think of what I do have on my mind. I'm afraid I don't have anything on my mind.
98000	100000	It seems like you have nothing on your mind right now.
100000	105000	I'm in the midst of a deadline on a treatment that I'm supposed to turn in.
105000	106000	I should have turned in on Friday.
106000	110000	It's been one of those weekends where you saw it coming and it was like,
110000	112000	so four-day weekend, this is going to be great.
112000	116000	The sick dog wasn't even allowed to leave the house.
116000	120000	So it was really, Cody and I were like, it's going to be four days in the house,
120000	126000	like just sitting in bed and we don't even have to feel like we're bad people for doing that
126000	129000	because we've got a dog to take care of.
129000	131000	And then I had to go fuck it up.
131000	132000	Is Nigel all right?
132000	133000	Yeah, he's okay.
133000	141000	Nigel ate like a big clump of grass and then he was in there and then...
141000	146000	Look, man, Spencer was pointing out on this...
146000	148000	Hey, guys.
148000	149000	Are you doing Spencer?
149000	150000	Are you doing Nigel open?
151000	160000	So we go into the veterinarian with the Nigel dog and the doctor comes in
160000	162000	and he's taking X-rays and then he's taking X-rays the next day,
162000	164000	so he's analyzing this thing.
164000	167000	And it's like, oh, there's this thing in his stomach and he's like,
167000	169000	I thought we were bringing him in for surgery.
169000	174000	But then the guy says, he goes, well, at this point, you know,
174000	179000	I think we should just wait because it's moving, this thing.
179000	180000	It's just like this big thing.
180000	182000	It looks like a tube sock, but it looks like a tube sock
182000	184000	because now it's in his intestine.
184000	188000	So everything that you would put in there would look like a tube sock.
188000	191000	You could put gold in there and it would look like a tube sock.
191000	193000	It's kind of a neat idea.
196000	199000	But he has this thing and I'd still...
199000	200000	I'll never know.
200000	201000	I don't know.
201000	202000	He just kept going.
202000	205000	We would say, well, he's panting now and then he'd go,
205000	207000	well, you guys, he's a sick dog.
207000	211000	And he just had that lilting tone and every sentence began with you guys.
211000	216000	And then we'd go, so you think we shouldn't operate on him.
216000	219000	Well, you guys, we don't know.
219000	225000	And the fifth time he did that, I said, you know,
225000	231000	you do this thing where you keep saying you guys and there's this tone
231000	235000	and the message that we're getting is that you don't want any information from us.
235000	238000	We're not doing anything wrong, doctor.
238000	241000	We're asking questions and saying words.
241000	243000	He's getting mad at us.
243000	247000	We're assuming that the science of caring for a dog,
247000	253000	since the dog can't talk, that maybe it might involve collecting some data from us.
253000	255000	Or maybe, hey...
255000	257000	I mean, I was just like...
257000	261000	Usually in that situation, maybe this is a bad habit that I have.
261000	262000	Maybe I'm a bully.
262000	264000	Maybe people are making me uncomfortable, making me feel bad.
264000	267000	Maybe I'm accustomed to the fact that then I'll shine a spotlight on it.
267000	272000	And maybe because I'm a six-foot-tall fat, like, Ursine kind of dude,
272000	276000	maybe I'm spoiled, maybe most of the people I'm talking to,
276000	279000	maybe I wouldn't do that if I was talking to The Rock, you know?
279000	282000	I wouldn't adjust him, you know?
282000	284000	Maybe I need to examine that.
284000	287000	But I haven't thought about that because it always works
287000	290000	because usually what the person does is they go, oh, God, oh, geez, no.
290000	293000	Because the very fact of, like, you're just pointing out
293000	296000	that there seems to be some kind of breakdown
296000	298000	is enough to get everybody kind of scrambled
298000	302000	and then you reset, now you're recalibrated and you're communicating as humans.
302000	304000	That's what I usually find.
304000	306000	But I was like, hey, you know, you're doing this thing
306000	308000	and it sounds like you don't want us to talk to you
308000	310000	and we don't know if we're supposed to say anything
310000	312000	and that's all, if that's the case, then I don't know.
312000	315000	And then he just kind of blinked, right?
315000	319000	And then he was like, well, you know, he's a sick dog
319000	323000	and he's going to say, you know, my recommendation is,
323000	324000	at this point, we should wait.
324000	326000	And you know, if you guys don't like having me as a doctor,
326000	328000	you know, you can get another doctor.
328000	329000	You can get another doctor.
329000	330000	And I was like, what?
330000	331000	Whoa!
331000	332000	But I didn't do anything.
332000	333000	I was, like, reeling.
333000	334000	And I was, like, just silence.
334000	335000	I was like, how do I react to this?
335000	338000	And during the silence, Spencer goes, if you think that's best.
338000	341000	Well, it wasn't like, just hold on.
341000	343000	Just hold on.
343000	347000	I think I said that we trusted his opinion
347000	349000	and we'll do whatever he thinks we should do
349000	350000	or something like that.
350000	352000	I don't think it was, like, sarcastic, like, yeah,
352000	353000	give us another doctor.
353000	354000	Oh, no, no.
354000	356000	I think it was like, yeah, no.
356000	357000	We trust.
357000	358000	You're the guy.
358000	360000	You're the guy to listen to.
360000	363000	You don't want to piss off a doctor when your dog is sick.
363000	364000	It's like you're pissing off.
364000	366000	Like, a waiter can spit in your food.
366000	371000	Your doctor can metaphorically spit in your dog.
371000	372000	Yes, he could.
372000	373000	Kill your dog.
373000	374000	So that guy leaves.
374000	375000	He just leaves.
375000	377000	And then I heard him slap an animal.
377000	381000	I thought when he said, if you guys want, you can see another doctor.
381000	384000	I thought he was saying it like a teenager would say it,
384000	387000	like a passive aggressive kind of like, you know,
387000	389000	maybe I'll go eat some worms if you want me to go eat some worms.
389000	391000	And we're supposed to go, oh, no, you're a great doctor,
391000	393000	which is why I was, like, stunned.
393000	396000	I didn't know what he was saying was, well, we have several doctors here.
396000	398000	Let me go get another one, which I guess is what he was doing.
398000	400000	You could hear him faintly out there talking to another guy.
400000	403000	And I'm like, saying to Spencer, like, is it me?
403000	404000	Is it you?
404000	405000	Is it the dog?
405000	406000	Is it him?
406000	410000	I was like, I don't think he knows that he sounds passive aggressive.
410000	412000	I think he's just stupid in that sense.
412000	416000	Yeah, he had, like, you know, maybe an aptitude for treating dogs
416000	419000	probably doesn't spike in the same brain statistically
419000	421000	as an aptitude for, like, communicating with people.
421000	422000	We don't know.
422000	423000	We don't know.
423000	427000	Yeah, there are certain fields of medicine that doctors will tell you
427000	431000	that, like, we're not people persons or we're not people people.
431000	432000	We want to solve you.
432000	434000	We don't want to hang out with you or talk to you.
434000	435000	We don't touch you.
435000	437000	We just want to, like, open you up and look at your insides.
437000	439000	Sure, and maybe this guy was like, oh, I get it.
439000	443000	They're animals, so I can be, like, a savage, horrible, primal monster.
443000	446000	Maybe you're so Ursine, and because he's a veterinarian,
446000	448000	he thought you might actually be a bear.
448000	449000	Right.
449000	450000	And so it was like a...
450000	452000	And he kept saying, you guys, to prove that you're actually a person
452000	453000	and not a bear.
453000	456000	It was the veterinarian equivalent of, like, a racism thing.
456000	460000	Like, he didn't really believe I was a bear, like, a magic talking bear,
460000	465000	but I put off enough of a bear vibe that a guy who loves dogs and cats
465000	469000	and shoots their ales is like, I don't like this guy.
469000	473000	He looks like someone that eats in a landfill,
473000	477000	and that's an enemy of the canine and the feline in my book.
477000	480000	My name's not Dr. Asshole.
480000	484000	So five minutes goes by, and a new doctor comes in,
484000	486000	and he goes, hello, my name's Dr. Ruiz.
486000	487000	And that was a surprise.
487000	490000	We did not expect a different doctor to come through the door.
490000	493000	Yeah, I thought maybe, like, a bouncer from Jerry Springer would come in
493000	496000	or something and, like, oh, well, you guys got to go.
496000	498000	Like, we need this room.
498000	501000	But a new doctor comes in, hi, I'm Dr. Ruiz.
501000	504000	He shakes our hands, and then he starts looking at the x-rays,
504000	508000	and he acts like nothing has happened.
508000	513000	He goes, like, oh, Dr. Ruiz, so we're going to do some exploratory surgery on Nigel.
513000	516000	We're going to go in, and we're going to pull this foreign body out.
516000	519000	And I'm like, what?
519000	523000	And Spencer says, okay, but what would you say if we told you
523000	526000	that the last guy said the exact opposite thing?
526000	528000	And the guy says, oh, no, I know that.
528000	529000	I just talked to him.
529000	530000	I totally disagree with him.
530000	534000	I have a totally second opinion about what to do about your dog.
534000	536000	Is it Anderson and Ruiz?
536000	538000	Like, that's the thing.
538000	541000	They're like, this is the thing that will plant me forever,
541000	545000	because this guy was nice, and I was like, yes, now we're talking.
545000	546000	I'll let my dog open.
546000	547000	See you later.
547000	548000	Here's $1,700.
548000	550000	I'll see you three days from now.
550000	554000	I changed my dog's life with a scalpel and just walked out skipping
554000	558000	and going, by the way, that first guy's a prick.
558000	562000	Like, was my part of some, were they just like, you know,
562000	565000	like the guy comes out and he goes, like, oh, we got to, you know,
565000	567000	they probably have some veterinarian code for it.
567000	570000	Like, we got to, we got to, we got to, we got to, we got to,
570000	573000	DFI or whatever, yeah.
574000	575000	And they're like, gotcha.
575000	578000	Let's cut his dog open and make him pay.
578000	583000	We just, is the second guy totally inept and loved?
583000	587000	Do they call him the butcher of Burbank?
587000	589000	But he's a people pleaser.
589000	591000	And so what's our first guy?
591000	595000	Like the Einstein of dogs eating shit?
595000	597000	And it's like, fuck, man, you know?
597000	599000	Like when he's on Charlie Rose, Charlie Rose will go,
599000	602000	what do you think is the biggest problem facing veterinary medicine?
602000	605000	I think it's, I think it's the worship of the myth of bedside manner.
605000	609000	I got to tell you, I, like, like, I've, I think we're,
609000	612000	I think we, we, we, these, these are patients that can't speak to us.
612000	614000	And if they, I'm sorry, I'm getting upset, Charlie.
614000	616000	He's like, yeah, well, you're doing this thing.
616000	617000	You sound kind of patronizing.
617000	618000	See, it's happening again.
618000	620000	But I'm telling you, I'm a good fucking dog doctor
620000	622000	and I could have been a brilliant child doctor,
622000	625000	but nobody's going to let me near those little fuckers.
625000	628000	Like, so I, so I, so I humble myself, I stoop,
628000	631000	I try to do my best, no harm.
631000	633000	I come into this stinky hospital.
633000	640000	I'm dealing with these little tiny scaled down disposable patients.
640000	643000	But I'm still a big prick.
643000	646000	I'm still the worst guy at the hospital.
646000	648000	And he's like, he's trying to save you money.
648000	650000	He's like, I don't think this is a big deal.
650000	654000	You're going to talk to Ruiz in 45 seconds and he loves to charge you for it.
654000	656000	I'll go get Jack the Ripper.
656000	658000	Elective, elective dog surgery.
658000	661000	Well, you like feeling good about yourself.
661000	664000	You want to make a best friend that loves cutting your dog up?
664000	665000	I'll go get him.
665000	666000	So what happened?
666000	667000	Did Nigel get sliced open?
667000	669000	Yeah.
669000	672000	And the ongoing debate was, is this going to be the world's,
672000	675000	is this going to be the end of our miyundis relationship?
675000	678000	Because is he going to pull out like a whole thing?
678000	681000	Because Nigel just eats a lot of fabric and stuff and it looked like,
681000	684000	you know, they give the dog barium and then all we knew is that there's a big
684000	687000	thing that soaked up all the barium moving very slowly through him.
687000	690000	So they, then Spencer called the hospital and then, uh, uh,
690000	693000	the subtext of the story is Spencer loves my dog more than me.
693000	698000	Uh, the, the, but he said they, they, they pulled grass out of him.
698000	699000	It was just grass.
699000	701000	It was a bunch of grass.
701000	702000	Yeah.
702000	706000	You know, cows, it takes some like three whole stomachs to digest that.
706000	707000	Cellulose.
707000	710000	You can't digest cellulose unless you're a dog.
710000	711000	Oh, wait, wait.
711000	712000	No.
712000	716000	Dogs and humans, deer and cows.
716000	717000	That's it.
717000	719000	They have, they have different systems to digest cellulose.
719000	722000	If you can get into the cellulose digesting game, that's like, oh boy,
722000	724000	that's like panning for gold.
724000	727000	Like, like, like, like you got to make a lot of biological sacrifices.
727000	730000	There's so much food in elephant poop that elephants that they get hungry
730000	731000	can eat their own poop.
731000	734000	There's still that much food because it's hard to break cellulose down.
734000	735000	So they break down a little bit.
735000	737000	It's like a very difficult thing.
737000	740000	You know, I guess maybe grass at one point was like, Jesus Christ,
740000	741000	what are we?
741000	743000	The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the biosphere's toilet paper.
743000	746000	Like, what if everyone's just going to eat us?
746000	747000	Fine.
747000	748000	Try, try eating us now.
748000	753000	And then everyone was like, and they're like, yeah.
753000	759000	My, my dog, I had a crazy dog when I was a kid and ate a bean bag open
759000	763000	and ate all the little tiny styrofoam pellets.
763000	768000	Ate like as much as it as could fit inside of a dog.
768000	771000	And then just kept pooping styrofoam poop.
771000	772000	Yeah.
772000	775000	Which is amazing because it was like the easiest poop to pick up
775000	780000	because it was so lightweight and versatile.
780000	784000	And then once I ate, went into one of my shoes, ate the shoe, like,
784000	787000	like a basketball shoe I had with, had like one of the footliners,
787000	789000	like the little pads that goes in there, ate the thing.
789000	791000	And it came out a spiral footliner.
791000	796000	It, it, it came out like, you could have put that back in the shoe.
796000	797000	Yeah.
797000	798000	Yeah.
798000	799000	It's like fucking boa constrictors.
799000	802000	Nigel, in a coat hanger two days before this all happened,
802000	804000	which is why I thought I was like, oh, that's a coat hanger.
804000	806000	He must have wood splinters in there.
806000	809000	He ate a coat hanger, a wooden, a nice wooden coat hanger.
809000	812000	He probably ate the grass to like chase it.
812000	814000	That's probably, that could be what it was.
814000	816000	He ate something softer than a coat hanger.
816000	817000	They do, they do eat grass.
817000	818000	That's what everyone keeps saying.
818000	819000	Well, you know, they eat grass with their stomach hurts.
819000	820000	I'm like, what is this?
820000	821000	What is this information?
821000	823000	Why are you gainsaying me?
823000	824000	It's a story.
824000	825000	They already pulled it out.
825000	826000	What do you want me to do about that?
826000	827000	You want me to go talk to the dog?
827000	830000	I think they want you to not know more than they do because they studied
830000	832000	medicine and they know how to fix dogs.
832000	834000	Oh, well, no, I was talking about people on Twitter.
834000	835000	Oh, okay.
835000	836000	Don't do that.
836000	837000	Yeah.
837000	839000	What do you think grass is thinking?
839000	840000	What was it?
840000	842000	Like evolutionarily, like, wait, what was it?
842000	846000	So grass is like a half step up from, because I know moss, you know,
846000	847000	I know moss.
847000	850000	And moss is like pre-curricular.
850000	854000	Can we have one podcast, Dan, when you're not going on your moss ramps?
854000	857000	Moss is like you're basically your first plant.
857000	860000	You know, it's like the idea of like, well, why don't we maybe, well,
860000	862000	what are we doing on the water all the time?
862000	865000	Why don't we just like be on a rock next to the water?
865000	868000	And then like, like we'll get splashed and we'll drink that.
868000	870000	But then we'll get a lot more sunlight or something like that.
870000	874000	But that's before the advent because then you're just limited to like the
874000	876000	surface of things.
876000	880000	And then the big step was capillary action,
880000	884000	taking advantage of water's slight negative ionic charge,
884000	887000	which you will see illustrated when you do dishes and try to pull your
887000	889000	plates apart.
889000	894000	That's a whole, that's how, but water, if it didn't have that,
894000	897000	if it didn't have that slight charge to it,
897000	901000	then it couldn't be drawn up as far basically as you want to.
901000	907000	A redwood tree is using that slight charge to carry water all the way up.
907000	911000	I'm probably very wrong about most of this,
911000	912000	but it's the precursor.
912000	916000	This by the way, Dan went, Dan briefly went to community college and
916000	919000	took a biology class, learned a lot about plants,
919000	923000	and now knows exactly this much about plants,
923000	926000	but wrote a TV show about going to community college.
926000	929000	But it's pretty fascinating because water has the first thing you learn
929000	931000	in biology is like, well, let's talk about water first.
931000	934000	It's because the water is like, oh, it's everywhere to us.
934000	936000	And it's like, oh, water, fuck water.
936000	937000	Eat shit, water.
937000	938000	You're a piece of shit.
938000	939000	Like, you're just like, whatever.
939000	940000	Like, oh, water is here.
940000	941000	Who cares?
941000	944000	Oh, it's old 80% of the earth.
944000	948000	But water is, it's a magical, a magical, it's not magical.
948000	950000	That's, if I'm trying to get you interested in science,
950000	953000	I shouldn't call things magical.
953000	957000	I should write a book about wizards or something.
957000	960000	You should write a book about wizards.
960000	961000	Good.
961000	962000	And you know what?
962000	965000	It's not hard.
965000	968000	It has many properties that make life on earth possible
968000	970000	if water was just a little bit different in any way.
970000	974000	For instance, water expands when it freezes, so it floats.
974000	977000	So a planet that goes through an ice age,
977000	981000	if water on top freezes and you get your little tiny boogens underneath,
981000	984000	your little creepy fish, they can keep living.
984000	987000	All those little monsters.
987000	988000	Cryo-boogens.
988000	990000	Cryo-boogens.
990000	993000	And that earth thaws and we come crawling back out and we go,
993000	995000	let's do this again.
995000	996000	Couldn't do that.
996000	1000000	You're fucking dropping some serious science on this show.
1000000	1001000	Yeah.
1001000	1002000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1002000	1003000	I like your Pink Floyd shirt.
1003000	1004000	That's very exciting.
1004000	1007000	Yeah, Cody went to the Roger Waters concert.
1007000	1011000	I guess he has like this big dick.
1011000	1013000	She showed me pictures.
1013000	1017000	Did anyone go to the, is anyone into Roger Waters?
1017000	1019000	She showed me a picture.
1019000	1023000	When I was your age, I mean, when I was 15,
1023000	1027000	I was like really into the Roger Waters Pink Floyd.
1027000	1028000	It was very important to me.
1028000	1032000	But I never actually bothered to see a photo of him because it was pre-internet.
1032000	1034000	I didn't go type Roger Waters.
1034000	1037000	Oh, let's see how he looks because I'm not a vain person.
1037000	1040000	I don't live in that world.
1040000	1048000	I thought he was probably black because he was important to me.
1048000	1049000	And I didn't care.
1049000	1057000	I cared enough to think he was black and positively judged him for the color of his skin.
1057000	1063000	But anyways, he's a very fit man because he's got to be 109.
1063000	1069000	So he's definitely not eaten what I ate this weekend.
1069000	1072000	And it's like a picture of him from the thing.
1072000	1076000	But he's got this big boner in his pants.
1076000	1077000	And Cody sent me a photo.
1077000	1079000	He's just like, look how big his dick is.
1079000	1085000	And look, look, look how hard it gets from his work.
1085000	1086000	Really, really.
1086000	1092000	You can just like, this is very like, like, like, that's, he, he wins.
1092000	1095000	Because also he made that album and it was like, oh, hey,
1095000	1099000	what walls are important to kids because they're about education or psychology.
1099000	1100000	Like, well, I'm young.
1100000	1101000	I'm going to, oh, I got it.
1101000	1103000	Oh, it's a brick on the wall.
1103000	1107000	And then, and then he got into his, you know, Steve Martin's, uh,
1107000	1110000	tweeting a couple, a couple bad jokes on Twitter kind of phase where you're like,
1110000	1112000	kind of like, okay, I'm not the sharpest guy.
1112000	1115000	I should probably try to hire writers from here.
1115000	1118000	Uh, like kind of, you know, we get, I'm getting to that age where, you know,
1118000	1121000	you want to start mentoring in comedy and, and, and other things.
1121000	1124000	Like, you're not, you know, like, well, you know, you kind of go,
1124000	1127000	you're going into your Gandalf the brown phase.
1127000	1132000	Kind of just like, go, go, go and just like start getting into growing basil or something.
1132000	1137000	And, uh, but at that exact age, the Berlin wall comes down and Roger Waters
1137000	1138000	comes out of retirement.
1138000	1141000	It's like, like, oh, let's do a concert for the wall.
1141000	1142000	Cause it's the wall.
1142000	1145000	And now you got, and then Trump is like, oh, the wall.
1145000	1148000	And he, he was like, let's do it.
1148000	1150000	He's got, he's got a perfect life.
1150000	1151000	I bet he was just out of money.
1151000	1153000	And then Trump was like, we're going to build a wall.
1153000	1160000	And he was like, and then he screwed down a fire pole and his own dick in his
1160000	1166000	head.
1166000	1169000	Uh, so Roger Winters got a big 90 year old car.
1169000	1174000	He's got a giant baton in his pants or he's so vain that he puts like a flashlight
1174000	1176000	down there because it's important.
1176000	1178000	Maybe that's like a holdover from 60s rock.
1178000	1179000	He's like, well, you got to do it.
1179000	1180000	Everybody does it.
1180000	1181000	Yeah.
1181000	1182000	I mean, you got to stuff.
1182000	1183000	People did stuff.
1183000	1185000	He might've, he might've, he might be an old school stuffer.
1185000	1186000	He probably not even thinking about it.
1186000	1189000	It's like, you know, we should have him on the show and find out.
1189000	1192000	Pardon.
1192000	1194000	You know, people that are on tour with him.
1194000	1197000	Can you, can you text him right now and find out how big his dick is?
1197000	1201000	All right.
1201000	1207000	I've got a little black book with my poems in it.
1207000	1211000	Got a bag, got a toothbrush and a comb.
1211000	1213000	Steven X.
1213000	1216000	All right.
1217000	1221000	That was some stuff I talked about at that weird show we did last week at
1221000	1224000	that freaky Chris Hardwick cult meeting.
1224000	1225000	Yeah.
1225000	1226000	We went to.
1226000	1227000	That was weird.
1227000	1232000	We made out in the woods and 90% of the crowd was dressed as stormtroopers or
1232000	1233000	meeseeks.
1233000	1234000	It was pretty wild.
1234000	1236000	I'll go wherever Hardwick tells me to go.
1236000	1237000	It's, it's called the patriarchy.
1237000	1238000	Look it up.
1238000	1242000	Like it's, it's, it's his, his, his, he's a hard wick.
1242000	1243000	I would, I would go.
1243000	1248000	If he was, if he was a soft wick, I would, I would listen to him 10% less.
1248000	1253000	And if he had no wick at all, nope, can't be president.
1253000	1254000	Oh, not funny.
1254000	1256000	Okay.
1256000	1257000	Too true.
1257000	1258000	Okay.
1258000	1261000	Just a little, we'll start it out as a simple word play and penis jokes turned
1261000	1268000	into a negatively resonant late motif for the ladies and the men that support
1268000	1269000	them.
1269000	1272000	It wasn't like there was a bunch of guys going, women can't be president.
1272000	1275000	We got, we got a lot of enlightened people here.
1275000	1278000	Sorry, I hurt you.
1278000	1281000	You're probably very excited then about that.
1281000	1285000	Uh, the, um, the fact that the 25th amendment is now going to be invoked
1285000	1289000	because he tweeted a meme, uh, with a CNN thing on it.
1289000	1290000	Oh yeah.
1290000	1293000	We're all just so like fucking, we're like, no, it's not.
1293000	1294000	What are you talking?
1294000	1295000	Just stop.
1295000	1296000	I think this is, this was like the big turning point.
1296000	1300000	Like I saw people on Twitter being like, even saying to guys, I really like like
1300000	1301000	Keith Olbermann and stuff.
1301000	1305000	They were just going like, like Keith Olbermann going, look, this is it.
1305000	1309000	They tweeted a meme with a CNN and is a wrestler hitting him.
1309000	1315000	And we got, we must now for the 700th time, we must do something about this
1315000	1316000	man.
1316000	1319000	And then just like a couple of people tweeting like, this is just a, like a
1319000	1320000	sideshow now.
1320000	1322000	Like, I don't even want to do this anymore.
1322000	1325000	Like this thing where we pretend like you can stop the antichrist.
1325000	1327000	Like it's not, let's just enjoy it.
1327000	1328000	It's biblical.
1328000	1329000	Let's just enjoy it.
1329000	1333000	I think, I think it's, it's, it's not a cheery thought, but I was thinking
1333000	1335000	today when I had the same reaction to that.
1335000	1340000	It's like, like we're going to look back fondly on today, like on these days
1340000	1343000	because he's not a professional tyrant.
1343000	1345000	The next president is going to be worse than him.
1345000	1347000	He, he, he's a clown.
1347000	1348000	It's going to get worse.
1348000	1350000	We're not going to go like, oh, this is the dark ages.
1350000	1352000	And we're going to have an awesome president next time.
1352000	1356000	It's going to get sadder and worse, but the next people are going to be pros,
1356000	1363000	not, not winging it and not being, you know, like, like just crappy, you know,
1363000	1365000	WWF characters, you know?
1365000	1370000	Well, it's like this monkey got loose on the Paramount lot and, and like
1370000	1373000	everyone's chasing it and going, get back here, Bobo.
1373000	1380000	And, and, and, but Bobo like is running into sound stages and like turning on
1380000	1384000	cameras and putting on a hat and like getting a two point rating, you know,
1384000	1388000	like, and, and so everyone that's everyone chasing him or cheering him on is all
1388000	1390000	going, ha that crazy monkey shit.
1390000	1393000	You can do that.
1393000	1395000	Like they said, like the monkey doesn't even know what it's doing.
1395000	1398000	Like it's running into edit bays and like pressing buttons that make just like
1398000	1402000	champagne and Coke come out in a big sliding wall that was hidden from the
1402000	1403000	Robert Evans era.
1403000	1408000	And like, everyone's like, okay, noted there too.
1408000	1409000	Yeah.
1409000	1415000	So, so, so, so if you have more than a 90 IQ plus choose fascism, you could
1415000	1417000	really get some shit done in this country.
1417000	1423000	Whereas he's just going like, I got lonely, I'm lonely.
1423000	1426000	So he went throughout his life.
1426000	1431000	Like he was, he was, he was the son of a fucking slumlord with a trust fund.
1431000	1435000	He blew through and then one day he tried, he was a Democrat and he tried to get
1435000	1437000	rich people to like him and rich people were like, you're tacky.
1437000	1438000	You're gross.
1438000	1439000	Like you're creepy.
1439000	1440000	I heard you fucked a 13 year old.
1440000	1441000	Get out of here.
1441000	1444000	And then, and he's like, those are allegations.
1444000	1447000	They're like, it means it's, you know, I don't have those allegations against
1447000	1448000	me.
1448000	1451000	I don't want the system to work that way, but I just think that you shouldn't
1451000	1453000	have 13 year olds accusing you of fucking them.
1453000	1454000	All right.
1454000	1459000	So the, the, the, the, the, just Google it and like, let's figure it out.
1459000	1464000	I don't know if he had like a pre-team model agency.
1464000	1467000	Like who has that?
1467000	1470000	He was like, so he's like, you know, he's like doing high society and like, hey,
1470000	1474000	I'm, I'm, I'm a big, I'm a big rich guy and I want to hang out with the bald ones
1474000	1477000	and the, and the things and the, and they're, you know, they're just, he's just
1477000	1478000	kind of a joke.
1478000	1479000	And then he's just like getting older and older.
1479000	1482000	And then he's like, there he's, and then he's like, so he's like, well,
1482000	1487000	what, so who, who in this world that's left like would ever just give me what
1487000	1490000	Howard Stern was giving me, what the television show was giving the other
1490000	1491000	thing.
1491000	1496000	And this is like, you know, the, the, the, the PT Barnum, like, like, like,
1496000	1501000	uh, the devil character from, uh, uh, Needful Things was like, well, uh,
1501000	1502000	I got the bin over here.
1502000	1507000	I just, just hillbilly Nazis would, would love you.
1507000	1508000	Are you sure about that?
1508000	1510000	That doesn't seem like a big fit to me.
1510000	1512000	It sounds like a great sitcom.
1512000	1515000	Like, like, like, no, no, they're pretty easy here.
1515000	1519000	Put on this trucker cap and just start saying, I'm tired of brown people.
1519000	1523000	Like, like it'll catch on or believe me where it's, it's, it's, we're,
1523000	1524000	we're rife for it.
1524000	1525000	And he's like, okay, I'll try it.
1525000	1528000	And it fucking worked and I'm going to kill myself.
1528000	1529000	All right.
1529000	1533000	But, uh, yeah, I was just thinking, you know, I was like, these other people
1533000	1536000	are like, Oh, Oh, look at it.
1536000	1537000	Uh, this is it.
1537000	1540000	This is a deal breaker with the wrestling thing that he tweeted.
1540000	1544000	Cause it was like so sad when people are like, cause it's violent imagery.
1544000	1547000	Is he promoting violence against journalists?
1547000	1548000	Like, well, don't play into that fucking.
1548000	1552000	He's promoting violence against good Photoshop or after effects.
1552000	1553000	That was pretty crude.
1553000	1554000	Yeah.
1554000	1556000	And the guy that did it, you know, and then everyone is like, well, look at the
1556000	1558000	last thing this guy did.
1558000	1561000	And it's like some Nazi shit about how everyone in CNN is a Jew or whatever.
1561000	1564000	And the, um, the, and it's there.
1564000	1565000	I agree.
1565000	1566000	I agree with him on that one.
1566000	1569000	You agree that everyone in CNN is a Jew.
1569000	1572000	Well, according to his chart, I mean, if you only go by that,
1572000	1573000	I don't have any other data.
1573000	1577000	Uh, it seemed like it was scientific.
1577000	1582000	The, um, the, but it was like, like decrying that, I feel like it was like,
1582000	1586000	actually didn't you kind of feel like when he, when he does something crazy,
1586000	1590000	then it's like, you kind of feel like, uh, what am I measuring it by?
1590000	1592000	But it just kind of like the Twitter's like, guys, like you see it.
1592000	1595000	I feel like you see a little spike in people going like, all right,
1595000	1596000	come on, man, knock it off.
1596000	1599000	Get off like people that voted for him going like, come on,
1599000	1600000	you're embarrassing me.
1600000	1606000	You know, but, but, but, but then the more that we go, that's right.
1606000	1607000	He's embarrassing you.
1607000	1611000	And technically he's in violation of political correctness because that's
1611000	1612000	actual racism.
1612000	1615000	If you look it up and then, and then the person that was like, you're embarrassing
1615000	1617000	me. Oh yeah. I remember why I voted for you.
1617000	1621000	Like, like, cause I feel stupid and barbaric and I'm tired of feeling that
1621000	1624000	way. So instead of improving myself, I pulled a lever that, you know,
1624000	1627000	I said, I would have to put that off for four years.
1627000	1629000	Uh, but that's us too.
1629000	1630000	We're all lazy.
1630000	1631000	We're online.
1631000	1633000	We're, none of us are out there doing fucking mental crunches,
1633000	1635000	like trying to figure out how to be good people.
1635000	1637000	I have only gotten to the point where I'm like, I'm just like, oh,
1637000	1640000	I was wrong about everything my entire life.
1640000	1644000	That's possible even when you're a genius.
1644000	1646000	So what hope do we have for morons?
1646000	1648000	How are they going to flip?
1648000	1652000	Like, what are we going to like, is there going to be an Abolisk outside of a
1652000	1656000	fucking a trailer park and like, like everyone that caused this problem is
1656000	1660000	going to like hear this high pitched wine and touch it and then throw a fucking
1660000	1666000	spray, spray, spray paint, spray paint can in the air that turns into a,
1666000	1670000	uh, a job at a solar, uh, a panel who factory.
1670000	1672000	I want you to never stop this metaphor.
1672000	1675000	I want this to go on for the rest of the show.
1675000	1678000	I want that to be a scene in a Kubrick movie.
1678000	1679000	I mean, what do we think we're going to do?
1679000	1681000	We're waiting. We're in a civil war culturally.
1681000	1684000	And believe me, there's just as many dumb people on both sides,
1684000	1686000	like in laziness and like ads to dumbness.
1686000	1689000	I was like, at this point we're at this like impasse or something and
1689000	1692000	impasses don't get, they don't just sit there.
1692000	1693000	Like we used to think we were at an impasse,
1693000	1696000	but what we were really in was like the reign of the bipartisan system,
1696000	1697000	which I used to sit there and scoff at,
1697000	1699000	but we didn't know how good we had it.
1699000	1701000	And it was like, Oh, I want my corruption back.
1701000	1702000	I want my bureaucracy back.
1702000	1706000	I want my, like, I want my fucking transparent collusion between two
1706000	1710000	corporations that just rigged debates and fucking just hang out back.
1710000	1714000	Like, and it's like, okay, so that system wasn't working for other people.
1714000	1716000	So I'm guilty of these crimes, right?
1716000	1718000	But then again, I didn't inherit my fucking money.
1718000	1721000	I worked for it and see, okay, now I sound Republican.
1721000	1723000	Like, like set, set, set.
1723000	1726000	So like, what, what, what, what, what?
1730000	1731000	All right.
1731000	1732000	Hit pause.
1732000	1733000	Hold up.
1733000	1738000	Somebody, one of our fans go online, make that a remix.
1738000	1739000	Whistle tip.
1739000	1741000	Whistle tip.
1741000	1744000	That was like the EDM kind of thing.
1745000	1747000	They, uh, yeah.
1747000	1748000	Uh, yeah.
1748000	1749000	Well, that's what it's not an impasse.
1749000	1750000	That's the thing.
1750000	1751000	Okay.
1751000	1754000	So here's why you kids, when, when, when, when, when grandpa,
1754000	1757000	when grandpa that made Rick and Morty and it's all, it's such a bummer.
1757000	1758000	Why is he such a cuck?
1758000	1761000	Like, like, wait, what, what are you doing?
1761000	1762000	Why are you talking about politics?
1762000	1766000	You make this great cartoon that's like, Oh, it speaks to, to, to,
1766000	1772000	to the very heart of my alt right or, or Bernie crack or Hillary loving or
1772000	1773000	Trump loving ass.
1773000	1774000	Yeah.
1774000	1778000	Because I'm a genius and it's called resonant storytelling and timeless
1778000	1781000	character craftsmanship and, and, and Justin Roiland's coattails.
1781000	1784000	And it's, there's a delicate recipe.
1784000	1789000	Also, a lot of the background art looks like dicks balls and vaginas.
1789000	1791000	But when you're, when you're all bummed out, like, Oh, why aren't you?
1791000	1793000	Oh, you used to be so fun.
1793000	1794000	I'm sure that's not true.
1794000	1799000	First of all, I'm sure I don't remember, but I don't think I was like a laugh
1799000	1801000	a minute when I was not political.
1801000	1803000	I was probably just gross or something.
1803000	1808000	I was probably just going like, is it me or bananas fitting in your ass wrong
1808000	1809000	or something?
1809000	1810000	That sounds fun.
1810000	1811000	I couldn't riff at a thing.
1811000	1816000	I didn't want to like, but like, like, which end is the wrong end of the banana
1816000	1817000	to put in your ass first?
1817000	1821000	You think the banana is the atheist worst nightmare.
1821000	1822000	Google it.
1825000	1829000	The like, you're all bummed out and you're going like, Dan, what is politics?
1829000	1830000	See, here's why you're doing that.
1830000	1831000	Here's why you're thinking that.
1831000	1834000	And I understand this because you're, you're younger than me.
1834000	1837000	And so, and it's, I'm not implying that when you get older, you know more.
1837000	1839000	I'm saying like, I've lived longer.
1839000	1848000	So if you've lived longer, so imagine like you're listening to a, a 10 minute song.
1848000	1849000	Okay.
1849000	1855000	And so, and you're, you walk into the room and it's been playing for eight minutes,
1855000	1859000	but now you're hearing your first minute of it.
1859000	1864000	If, if the people that have been in that room longer are saying, I think this
1864000	1867000	song is ending, listen to them.
1867000	1870000	They have gotten more of a feel for it.
1870000	1873000	It doesn't, it's not so much like, oh, you're so much smarter.
1873000	1877000	Your IQ keeps growing saying this doesn't happen.
1877000	1878000	And I think everyone keeps saying that.
1878000	1882000	And I'm like, it's like, I know the difference between like, oh, the dangling
1882000	1886000	chads and the abortion arguments and the gays in the military and the Republican
1886000	1888000	Democrat and just out and out.
1888000	1893000	Like we're, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem here that has really
1893000	1898000	actually nothing to do with what we used to call politics because that word has
1898000	1903000	for 44 years has to me has meant the boring thing, the grownup thing, the part
1903000	1909000	of the scam part of the thing, but politics now it's like actually like, I
1909000	1913000	mean, there's only once this stops being the case where everyone's like all
1913000	1914000	freaked out.
1914000	1919000	Like it's not, it's going to be like people, you're going to be wearing like
1919000	1923000	jumpsuits and stuff and we're going to be like walking in like stainless steel
1923000	1928000	honeycombs like the deep beneath a Mars station and they're going to be being
1928000	1932000	told, I'm now making it sound cool.
1932000	1937000	We're never going to get to Mars because, because whoever comes after Trump is
1937000	1940000	going to be like, is going to win by opposing gravity.
1940000	1944000	Like as a, and people are going to be like, yo, what, why are you libtards
1944000	1945000	always talking about how there's gravity.
1945000	1950000	If you want to get to space.
1950000	1952000	Did you see how stupid that is?
1952000	1958000	Oh, here's the, here's a meme of a gorilla going, hmm, I want to go into space.
1958000	1963000	I think I'll say that nothing can go up forever.
1963000	1969000	That's you.
1969000	1972000	Because the, because the world will be an ocean and there won't, that will,
1972000	1974000	there will be, okay, well we were wrong.
1974000	1975000	Yeah, okay.
1975000	1977000	We were wrong about the polar ice caps, you know, but what's,
1977000	1980000	what is this gravity you're always talking about?
1980000	1981000	I see.
1981000	1985000	If you're, if you're poor and you want to get into space, just jump.
1985000	1989000	If you believe in yourself, you should be able to fly.
1989000	1993000	Well, technically, you know, no, no egg head.
1993000	1997000	You fucking sell out you traitor.
1997000	2000000	You, I know it.
2000000	2009000	I haven't checked my chart yet, but you got that fucking Jurassic Park vibe.
2009000	2011000	What, which character?
2011000	2015000	Which character?
2015000	2016000	Goldblum?
2016000	2021000	Yeah, the Stegosaurus.
2021000	2025000	You better wake up motherfucker.
2025000	2030000	Did you see that fucking, holy shit in a bottle?
2030000	2034000	Did you see that NRA video that was like, whoa.
2034000	2035000	Yeah.
2035000	2036000	See it's, it's over.
2036000	2038000	Like, like, like, like not over.
2038000	2041000	Like, like, I mean you over, like, like schools out.
2041000	2044000	Like, like, like, like they're saying like, it's over.
2044000	2047000	Everybody do what you got to do.
2047000	2050000	So that's a cue for activists.
2050000	2054000	That video was like what's playing on a TV in the background and Robocop 2.
2055000	2056000	Yeah.
2056000	2057000	So much far beyond that.
2057000	2062000	It was all those crazy, and here's the craziest thing about that video to me.
2062000	2066000	When those guys, like, there's a, there's a, when, when, when, when someone goes into
2066000	2073000	a school and shoots like 20 people and then their response is, well, I'll tell you this
2073000	2074000	much.
2074000	2078000	If, if the teachers had guns, they would, they would only be 10.
2078000	2079000	Yeah.
2079000	2080000	Okay.
2080000	2081000	All right.
2081000	2082000	Okay.
2082000	2083000	So everybody, everybody should have had a gun.
2083000	2084000	No.
2084000	2085000	Yeah.
2085000	2086000	Everybody should have a gun.
2086000	2087000	Okay.
2087000	2088000	Got it.
2088000	2089000	I get it.
2089000	2090000	I get it.
2090000	2091000	There's almost an honesty there.
2091000	2093640	Like, I don't know if they believe it or not, but their message is transparent.
2093640	2098960	They're going, oh, 20 kids got shot, so everyone should have a gun.
2098960	2101000	There is no hidden agenda.
2101000	2108320	That video, they're saying, they're pretending that they think that because police can't quell
2108320	2114200	disruption enough on their own without causing more of it, that if there's any psychos out
2114200	2118160	there with their ears on, you might want to just start DIYing it.
2118160	2120120	That might actually work.
2120120	2124600	That's the unspoken implication is like, you should, you should jump in because the government's
2124600	2125720	hands are tied.
2125720	2127080	They're cucked out, man.
2127080	2130520	Like, like they're, they gotta, they gotta do these Miranda's and all these things and
2130520	2133440	well, and then the minute they poke someone with a stick, if they're wearing a badge,
2133440	2134720	then there's more protests.
2134720	2136440	It's like, it's crazy.
2136440	2140200	So you know, and then they end it with like now more than ever, you gotta just like, you
2140200	2141520	gotta fucking hit.
2141520	2149760	So what they're like, they're saying to their base, like if you're out of your goddamn mind
2149760	2156600	and you pop off, uh, it could be a solution and they know that that's not true.
2156600	2161000	They know that that person will go to prison and they know there will be even more disruption
2161120	2164440	and, and, and, and embroilment and civil war and stuff.
2164440	2169620	And they, I, I mean like, it's almost admirable in its villainy.
2169620	2171160	I mean, they're so committed.
2171160	2175120	Like I'm pretty sure like, they're about six months from going, okay, now we've been putting
2175120	2176840	this off for 60 years.
2176840	2182840	We're finally gonna like put one foot on each dolphin here and we're going to start being
2182840	2186840	actively marketing to liberals as well cause they're gonna, they're gonna love another
2186840	2187840	video coming up.
2187840	2190040	And it's open season on you motherfuckers.
2190040	2194280	It's like, you can't go to a protest these days without worrying about who's gonna shoot
2194280	2195280	you.
2195280	2196280	Am I right?
2196280	2197520	Well, they already did that.
2197520	2198520	You bought a gun.
2198520	2200520	They already did it to me.
2200520	2204720	It's, that's, that's the, it's called white male fragility, not white male endurance.
2204720	2209360	I'm not going to be the last person to buy a gun.
2209360	2214680	I'm like that little mercury thing that explodes when something gets a little too hot because
2214680	2215680	there's a fire.
2215680	2218080	And you haven't even, have you shot it yet?
2218080	2219080	Have you taken it?
2219080	2220080	I didn't get it to shoot it.
2220080	2221880	I got it to wait until someone shoots me.
2221880	2224680	Yeah, but you're going to get it.
2224680	2229400	Someone's going to come on your doorstep with a burning pitchfork and cause that's the thing.
2229400	2231200	You think pitchforks are dangerous.
2231200	2235520	When you light the tips of the pitchfork on fire, you got a real, a real problem on your
2235520	2236520	hands.
2236520	2237520	Yeah.
2237520	2240680	In ancient times, angry moms needed torches and pitchforks.
2240680	2241680	It was a mess.
2241680	2242680	Yeah.
2242680	2244680	And then, uh, it took us like, why did it take us so long?
2244680	2249760	It was, I think it was Eli Whitney who found out that if you combine fire and the pitchfork,
2249760	2253840	you get a flaming trident, the ultimate angry mob facilitator.
2253840	2259160	And if you can combine that with writing two dolphins at the same time, you're, you might
2259160	2262720	be the most terrifying individual in mythology.
2262720	2263720	You're certainly not a redneck.
2263720	2264720	That's for sure.
2264720	2269920	If you were pitchforks on fire and you can still write two dolphins.
2269920	2276840	Then on two dolphins and the way you express your, your frustration with the ruling class
2276840	2281560	or a monster is a flaming trident.
2281560	2282560	You're probably not a redneck.
2282560	2283560	You're probably not a redneck.
2283560	2286400	You might be like Prince Namor, I don't know.
2286400	2289480	You might be from like Mount Olympus.
2289480	2290480	Yeah.
2290480	2294760	Uh, but did you notice that jump, the shark, that invention, angry mobs, they just stopped.
2294760	2299480	They, you know, you never, you never see the flaming trident, uh, used in angry mobbery.
2299720	2301840	Well, Egypt kind of did it.
2301840	2307640	Like the Arab spring kind of thing that they went full on, like angry mob shit.
2307640	2308640	They went storm the best deal.
2308640	2309640	They have a flaming trident.
2309640	2310640	I don't know.
2310640	2313080	They probably have the modern equivalent of that.
2313080	2314080	All right.
2314080	2315080	Well, we'll get back to that.
2315080	2316080	Uh, wait.
2316080	2319220	I'm just saying, but you, you're going to, you're going to wait until somebody comes
2319220	2325480	up at your place with a weapon to take your dog or, or, or something, and then you're
2325480	2326480	going to pick up your gun.
2326480	2329040	Like Woody Allen was going to fly apart because you don't know how to use it.
2329480	2330480	You've never, you have to go.
2330480	2333640	I've already field stripped it and cleaned it and put it back together.
2333640	2340200	What I don't know how to do is get the little, the rockets inside the clippy thing.
2340200	2345160	I can't, I can get one in and then I'm like, really, it's this, you have to push this
2345160	2346160	hard.
2346160	2347160	It's going to shoot.
2347160	2348160	It's going to shoot.
2348160	2351360	I'm pretty sure you can go in, you can go on Google and type in how to put rockets and
2351360	2355080	clippy bits and you'll, I'm scared to load the magazine.
2355080	2358760	Because also that's like, that's, you know, now you're actually loading a gun in your
2358760	2359760	house.
2359760	2360760	I haven't gotten that far yet.
2360760	2363560	I just put, I, but I was like, I wonder if it takes some thumb strength to get those,
2363560	2367600	uh, I gotta get these little bad boys ready for the revolution.
2367600	2368600	Yeah.
2368600	2371160	Look, man, I don't know what to tell you.
2371160	2376200	I'm not a role model.
2376200	2381560	I got two dogs and a girlfriend and I live on a big house on a hill with a lot of fresh
2381560	2383400	water in it.
2383400	2385400	I got a gun.
2385400	2387280	I got a hammer in case of nails.
2387280	2391080	You just told, you just told her, however many people listen to our podcast that you
2391080	2392560	don't know how to load it.
2392560	2397280	So it's, it's not really, I don't know what kind of security level you think you're at
2397280	2398680	right now.
2398680	2402160	Maybe I'm all the way past into the world where I'm setting traps.
2402160	2407600	Have you ever, maybe I'm like jigsaw, maybe I'm like playing like lame, lame, lame wounded
2407600	2409000	duck or whatever you call it.
2409000	2410000	Have you, have you fired a weapon before?
2410000	2411000	Have you fired a gun?
2411000	2416000	I feel like when I was a kid, I fired a gun in a, like a camping trip or something.
2416000	2419640	How much fresh water did you say was in your house, Dan?
2419640	2422440	Look, you don't need a gun if you want to take my water.
2422440	2426320	I just want to estimate of how much of fresh water you think you have on your process.
2426320	2429720	I keep forgetting to cancel my sparklets, uh, or my arrowhead delivery.
2429720	2431960	Can I go out of town on all these shows all the time?
2431960	2436160	So I've got, I have a gigantic pyramid of bottles of water.
2436160	2438960	So the real fresh water is a jet shot.
2438960	2443120	I feel like I used to have that, but I, I got these cameras installed because I'm Batman
2443120	2448800	and, and, uh, and now that I got the camera, I swear I thought I saw a pretty chat.
2448800	2452200	I thought, I thought, I thought I saw, Google it.
2452200	2458440	It's a great, uh, the, the, the, the, I thought I could swear I saw the sparklets guy or whatever
2458440	2464680	you call them now, the Nestle mobile oil guy, whatever fucking, the, the Pentagon, uh, ministry
2464680	2476360	of, of, of drinkables, uh, centurion, uh, brought, brought a five gallon drum of water.
2476360	2480000	And uh, and I was watching him on the camera, like Phil Spector, just like playing with
2480000	2491960	my gun and just watching him because he had kind of a Cuban vibe, uh, and I swear it was
2491960	2497200	like, he came up and then I saw, I thought he left with water.
2497200	2498520	He took my water.
2498520	2499780	I think they take it now.
2499780	2501480	He might take empty ones.
2501480	2503760	He take, no, he was like, it was, it was heavy.
2503760	2507480	Like he was like, oh, this water I brought up.
2507480	2509480	I don't, I think he took my water.
2509480	2510520	I don't know what happened.
2510520	2514800	I don't, so I don't know why I should, maybe he brought too many and then I was like, oh,
2514800	2516760	I gotta take this back.
2516760	2518680	I gotta remember to call them.
2518680	2523480	I canceled it for, I forget how many months because like I've got 9,000 things of water
2523480	2524480	in my place.
2524480	2528480	You're not supposed to do Nestle, by the way, you know, if you're interested in your consumer
2528480	2536640	dollars advocating because boy, we're still at that stage and not at all like the branches
2536640	2540960	of the government are collapsing into a fucking like murder van that's going to drive around.
2540960	2548320	But if it was 1999 and you thought the way you spent your next water dollar would influence
2548320	2555860	the totally fair capitalistic biosphere in the, the Nestle, the Nestle guy, like he's
2555860	2559640	on record as saying in interviews, like, yeah, I don't get it.
2559640	2563000	I don't understand why water is considered a natural resource.
2563000	2564000	That doesn't make any sense.
2564000	2565000	It's a product.
2565000	2566000	Everybody buys it.
2566000	2567000	You need it.
2567000	2568000	You drink it.
2568000	2570080	Looks like a candy bar.
2570080	2574760	They also, they're also like, they're trying to buy up all this water that's like cheap.
2574760	2576280	That's like reservoirs and stuff.
2576280	2578840	And they're getting these crazy deals for it.
2578840	2580840	And they're just, they're going to profit off of it.
2580840	2582680	But the water they're buying is so cheap.
2582680	2587240	It's like you could start a Kickstarter and buy the water for like cheaper than them except,
2587240	2589000	you know, we're not corporations.
2589000	2593360	So we don't have access to these markets, but it's like, we could buy that water that
2593360	2600560	we don't want Nestle to buy from us, but you know, they won't let us do it.
2600560	2601560	It's fucked up.
2601560	2608800	But all your money into Arrowhead, they're a Native American tribe that makes their own
2608800	2624120	water out of, out of a trail of tears out of, they also make salt.
2624120	2628840	I'm so glad I didn't think of that because I would have said it like, what, what, what
2628840	2629840	is that?
2629840	2636040	Can we hear Sam Elliott's commercial for the fully croissant?
2636040	2639840	Hello, I'm Sam Elliott for Arrowhead Water.
2639840	2645720	You know, our water's salty and here's the reason why.
2645720	2658720	Andrew Jackson, no, no, 80% of your body can't be wrong.
2658720	2663480	It's just general water advertising, I don't know, it's not for trail of tears.
2663480	2667720	The trail of tears was of course a horrible thing that would be totally offensive, but
2667720	2668720	we made it delightful.
2668720	2669720	Right.
2669720	2673720	Well, also there's, it's like, it's, we, the history's written by the winners and there's
2673720	2677720	not, you know, it's, we're not, we're not afraid of the, I'm, that's my apology to anyone
2677720	2678720	who is listening.
2678720	2679720	That's like, that's a little hurtful.
2679720	2687440	I'm like, I'm sorry, like, like, because it's just, it shouldn't, it shouldn't be a numbers
2687440	2688440	game.
2688440	2689440	Like, you know, like, like what's offensive?
2689440	2693320	You know, it shouldn't be like, oh, that group isn't like going to million man march us.
2693320	2697160	So you recently made a, I thought I'd tell a putty tent reference.
2697160	2701440	They don't think you're current.
2701440	2703120	You're a, you're a baby boomer.
2703120	2707680	You still, you know, you're so loud.
2707680	2713480	Why is it now?
2713480	2716480	Just hear those sleigh bells tingling, a ring ting tingling.
2716520	2718160	It's got ice stuck to his balls.
2718160	2722960	I've never seen that much ice stick to anything.
2722960	2729320	It's should we bring up our, let's bring up two of our friends so we can, uh, yeah, uh,
2729320	2731920	let's bring up Abed Gaeth and Kelly Fonteccio.
2731920	2732920	Yeah.
2732920	2733920	Kelly and Abed.
2733920	2734920	Kelly and Abed.
2735920	2736920	Hey, buddy.
2736920	2737920	Oh my God.
2737920	2738920	Look at that.
2738920	2739920	Kelly Kazoo and real Abed too.
2739920	2740920	It's a double whammy.
2740920	2741920	There's a cloud underneath this crazy, what the fuck?
2741920	2742920	It's a cloud of ice.
2742920	2743920	It's a cloud of ice.
2743920	2744920	Did you not notice that when you were sitting?
2744920	2745920	I was focused on the Fonteccio and I was like, I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2745920	2746920	You got the last name right, which is a big, like a big, uh, you know, that's a big achievement.
2746920	2747920	I've never said your last name.
2747920	2748920	Thank you.
2748920	2749920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2749920	2750920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2750920	2751920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2751920	2752920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2753920	2754920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2754920	2755920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2755920	2756920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2756920	2757920	I've never said your last name.
2757920	2758920	Thank you.
2758920	2759920	You said it correctly.
2759920	2760920	He said it now, just now, right?
2760920	2761920	Yeah.
2761920	2762920	We both have unpronounceable names.
2762920	2763920	Well, you're named after Kali, like the god of destruction or whatever.
2763920	2764920	God is a death.
2764920	2765920	I usually always shake his hand when I come up.
2765920	2766920	Okay.
2766920	2767920	Sorry, I had to do that.
2767920	2768920	I'm glad we didn't miss that moment.
2768920	2769920	It's a ritual.
2769920	2770920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2770920	2771920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2771920	2772920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2772920	2773920	I'm going to nail the Fonteccio.
2774920	2775920	God is a death.
2775920	2777920	Always shake his hand when I come up.
2778920	2779920	Sorry, I had to do that.
2780920	2781920	I'm glad we didn't miss that moment.
2781920	2782920	It's a ritual.
2782920	2784920	No, no, I was like 2 seconds.
2784920	2785920	No, it was important.
2785920	2786920	Very important.
2786920	2788920	I did it every time I came up here.
2788920	2789920	As includes now.
2789920	2791920	Hey, keep that tradition going.
2791920	2792920	Eat that mic.
2792920	2793920	All right.
2793920	2794920	Thanks.
2794920	2797920	Kali, you're looking very smart with your fuzzy Simpsons bag over there.
2797920	2798920	Thank you.
2798920	2800820	It's Sauma and Patty.
2800820	2801820	It's nice.
2801820	2802820	Patty, yeah.
2802820	2803820	It's nice.
2803820	2805820	My favorite part is their unshaved legs.
2805820	2807820	How's Patty and Selma?
2807820	2808820	Patty and Selma.
2808820	2810820	Did you purchase this, or is there something you created?
2810820	2811820	Oh, no, I purchased this.
2811820	2812820	Yeah.
2812820	2814820	It's a purse slash pillow.
2815820	2818820	I guess when you pass out at parties, you need that.
2818820	2819820	Yeah.
2819820	2820820	Because then you can just use a pillow that isn't there.
2820820	2822820	There's never a pillow.
2822820	2823820	I passed out at a party recently.
2823820	2824820	No pillow.
2824820	2825820	Oh, boy.
2825820	2827820	I remember you talked to a guy who passed out at a party, but you didn't care.
2827820	2828820	It was Rod.
2828820	2829820	Oh, yeah, that was Rod Hasler.
2829820	2830820	Oh, my God.
2830820	2832820	That story's never going away.
2832820	2833820	That story's never going away.
2833820	2837820	It's like the OK corral, or it's like you shot a match off a buffalo's back or something.
2837820	2840820	Why in the fuck does that story keep coming up all the time?
2840820	2843820	I'll tell you why by telling you the story.
2843820	2847820	It was a Halloween party, or no, it was a wizard party.
2847820	2850820	Is it where me and Justin were?
2850820	2855820	Everyone came dressed as actual wizards, like cone hats, like moons and stars and wands.
2855820	2859820	Me and Justin, we just went to a thrift store and found random shit, and then he was the
2859820	2864820	wizard of cell phone technology, and I was the wizard of the past or something.
2864820	2865820	I had like an Indian outfit.
2865820	2867820	I mean, the Native American outfit.
2867820	2868820	Oh, shit, sorry.
2868820	2869820	So the party's winding down.
2869820	2870820	People are getting kind of high.
2870820	2871820	There's maybe nine people.
2871820	2872820	We're tired.
2872820	2876820	There's just a bunch of out of shape wizards sitting in the main area of the party.
2876820	2878820	Because it was a full-on wizard dance party.
2878820	2880820	It was just wizards just dancing.
2880820	2881820	Yeah, dude, it was fun, man.
2881820	2882820	I had a great time.
2882820	2883820	I love seeing wizards at parties.
2883820	2884820	All of our mana has worn down.
2884820	2886820	We're regenerating it.
2886820	2888820	And we're just talking.
2888820	2892820	And at some point, somebody goes like, all right, I'm going to keep talking to you like
2892820	2899820	this because I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but I want you to, at some point,
2899820	2902820	look over to the other room where...
2902820	2903820	It was Rob, wasn't it?
2903820	2910820	Where Abed is sitting in a director chair next to our friend Rod Hasler, who is also
2910820	2912820	sitting in a director's chair only.
2912820	2916820	At that point, Rod, he's like, watch, Abed is talking to Rod.
2916820	2917820	And Rod...
2917820	2918820	Excuse me.
2918820	2919820	Rod is just...
2919820	2921820	He's falling asleep.
2921820	2923820	He's not always sleeping.
2923820	2926820	His head keeps...
2926820	2930820	If you were talking to somebody and they went like that...
2930820	2933820	He was slightly awake.
2933820	2936820	Maybe he's a bad listener.
2936820	2939820	But that's where heroism comes in.
2939820	2943820	By the time that passed around to me, everybody just look over there.
2943820	2944820	Don't make a big deal.
2944820	2947820	I looked over and Rod was completely comatose.
2947820	2948820	He kept getting funnier and funnier.
2948820	2951820	He says, his head was dangling like an apple on an old tree.
2951820	2952820	Well, that's my fault.
2952820	2953820	The tree got more boring.
2953820	2955820	His head was parallel to the floor.
2955820	2958820	There was no mistaking this man for conscience.
2958820	2960820	I went to work stories and it all timed out.
2960820	2963820	Also, there was a point, because you were talking, and everyone was watching you, but
2963820	2968820	we couldn't quite hear what you were saying, but there was a point where his head was just
2968820	2971820	dangling over the arm of the chair.
2971820	2977820	We were all watching you, and then at a certain point, you reacted to him.
2977820	2980820	As if he had interrupted you or something.
2980820	2985820	He had made a good point that allowed you to...
2985820	2986820	Well, that's a different matter.
2986820	2990820	He was listening, but he slightly zoned out.
2990820	2993820	Maybe he snored or something, and you're like, well, speaking of that...
2993820	2995820	Well, I thought he was still awake.
2995820	2998820	So then he did some motion that I'm like...
2998820	2999820	How could you...
2999820	3000820	What, in the weekend at Bernie's...
3000820	3002820	Were you talking about Farscape?
3002820	3007820	No, I was talking about, well, we worked together at the time on Mancers, and I was saying stuff
3007820	3009820	like, do people at work like me?
3009820	3010820	Am I annoying?
3010820	3016820	And I think I was trying to get validation that people liked me at work, so I was confused,
3016820	3018820	because they treated me weird there.
3018820	3020820	So I'm like, come on, they like me, right?
3020820	3022820	And I think he phased out at a certain point.
3023820	3028820	I was so passionate about what I was talking about that I didn't notice he passed out.
3028820	3030820	So, yeah, you guys saw that.
3030820	3031820	You saw me...
3031820	3033820	I mean, he was awake two seconds ago.
3033820	3035820	And then in those two seconds, he fell asleep.
3035820	3038820	Well, thank you for saying the words pass out so that we could all remember to mock you
3038820	3040820	for that same thing from like 11 years ago.
3040820	3044820	Look, it was weird because you guys looked over at the right comedic moment where it was funny.
3044820	3047820	No, no, we were watching you for 45 minutes.
3047820	3048820	There was no...
3048820	3049820	It wasn't a window.
3049820	3051820	Oh, you got it just the right time.
3051820	3054820	Like, planet Earth, like, oh, man, that orca just left up.
3054820	3055820	For real.
3055820	3058820	We were all playing it cool, but marveling.
3058820	3062820	You kind of had your head down, and you were making a point about Ben Foltz live or something.
3062820	3064820	And some record or whatever.
3064820	3066820	And he was completely dead.
3066820	3068820	You were trying to get a corpse.
3068820	3069820	And we were like...
3069820	3072820	He didn't have it right now.
3072820	3073820	I'm so embarrassed.
3073820	3076820	I mean, because the weird thing is later when you guys said you were watching the whole time,
3076820	3078820	I was like, I didn't remember.
3078820	3081820	I was like, I did talk to him, but I didn't remember if he was asleep.
3081820	3082820	I mean, we were all...
3082820	3085820	It was the end of a very long drunken party, so everybody gets a pass on that one.
3085820	3087820	But it was delightful.
3087820	3089820	It sounds like we're making fun of you.
3089820	3090820	It kind of...
3090820	3092820	For you guys, it was delightful.
3092820	3093820	I mean, I don't...
3093820	3096820	It was almost like watching a superhero.
3096820	3098820	Like, you...
3098820	3099820	That's weird.
3099820	3100820	I mean, we make fun of...
3100820	3101820	Look, I was thinking about it.
3101820	3103820	I can talk to people why they sleep.
3103820	3104820	I'm a superhero.
3105820	3110820	Because we're writing this treatment and there's this character in the thing that Mike McMahon and I are talking about.
3110820	3115820	We're talking about the character, and we're like, oh, he's a character that's kind of deluded himself.
3115820	3116820	And then we're talking about that.
3116820	3121820	And then it was like...
3121820	3124820	I was like, wait, yeah, you know...
3124820	3125820	He's living in his dreams.
3125820	3126820	He's living in his character.
3126820	3128820	He's living in his dreams.
3128820	3131820	And it's a fine line between that and living a lie.
3131820	3135820	And I think the difference is, well, what are you making other people lie?
3135820	3138820	And if they say that you're lying, do you get mad at them?
3138820	3139820	And I was like, oh, that's...
3139820	3142820	I think that we would all admit, if the stakes weren't so high,
3142820	3147820	that there is this half of our president, or 25%, that was like...
3147820	3157820	We kind of marvel at his absolute fucking, like, dead-nerved, like...
3158820	3161820	It's funny and almost cool, from a writer's perspective,
3161820	3166820	a character that if you said, can you pass the salt, they would say,
3166820	3171820	yes, I will do the best job of passing salt of anyone that's ever passed you salt.
3171820	3172820	Did it?
3172820	3173820	Ask around.
3173820	3174820	I passed the salt the best.
3174820	3176820	You see me as a character, don't you?
3176820	3177820	You are a character.
3177820	3178820	Are you kidding me?
3178820	3180820	No, no, I'm not talking about you, you narcissist.
3180820	3182820	I understand. I understand.
3182820	3184820	I'm just trying to laser into what you're saying.
3184820	3187820	With him, it's like, when we talk about that aspect of him,
3187820	3191820	if you could just isolate it, if you could just, like, suck that little bit of juice,
3191820	3194820	like, we're envious of that, because it's called, like...
3194820	3197820	This is like a writer's meeting you had with Mike McMahon?
3197820	3200820	You were like, we can't figure out, Ovin, what's the deal with him?
3200820	3201820	No, no, no, no.
3201820	3202820	That's a function.
3202820	3204820	No, it was a related thing.
3204820	3205820	Oh, I see.
3205820	3206820	I'm tying it back to me.
3206820	3208820	Maybe I am the narcissist, you're right.
3208820	3209820	I'm bringing it back around you.
3209820	3212820	I am pretty narcissist, thank you, you just brought it out.
3212820	3213820	I'm just saying, like...
3213820	3214820	You're doing what you gotta do.
3214820	3216820	All of us have, maybe, blind spots.
3216820	3218820	I'm not gonna try to universalize it.
3218820	3221820	I'm saying, like, you could talk to a guy who is, like, catatonic.
3221820	3223820	It's like, we're making fun of you for it.
3223820	3224820	I see.
3224820	3227820	But, like, there's also, like...
3227820	3233820	I'm trying to learn that from this, like, you know,
3233820	3240820	troglodyte that we've chosen to celebrate our demise as a culture,
3240820	3242820	not you, as a president.
3242820	3243820	Oh, I know.
3243820	3245820	I'm trying to, like, I'm trying to, like, see the...
3245820	3246820	I'm, like, I'm, like...
3246820	3247820	You're wheeling in a fish here.
3247820	3248820	What do you admire about him?
3248820	3249820	Like, and why is he so...
3249820	3252820	How come you watch, like, Huckabee, like, get away with it,
3252820	3253820	or not get away with it?
3253820	3256820	Like, you can see, like, Huckabee on Twitter trying to, like,
3256820	3260820	all right, I guess the market's prime for an old man to be kind of a...
3260820	3261820	Now it's my turn.
3261820	3262820	Kind of a ghost ball on Twitter.
3262820	3263820	It's the Huckabee hour.
3263820	3264820	No, you're the worst.
3264820	3266820	I'm running in here.
3270820	3271820	Whatever, Abbott.
3271820	3272820	I'm with you.
3272820	3273820	I'm trying to give you...
3273820	3276820	Between my danceplaining your Abbott-ness, like,
3276820	3278820	and you being Abbott during it, it's, like, we're...
3278820	3279820	The audience is, like, we've...
3279820	3280820	It's a black hole.
3280820	3281820	We're gonna die.
3281820	3282820	Yeah, but you guys...
3282820	3283820	My wristwatch turned into legs.
3283820	3286820	You guys are doing your own show that's gonna be happening...
3286820	3287820	We are.
3287820	3288820	On NBC.
3288820	3290820	So, here.
3290820	3291820	On the 6th, right?
3291820	3292820	A couple days.
3292820	3293820	Yeah, Starburn's Castle.
3293820	3295820	Yeah, this is what you'll see.
3295820	3296820	It's our second ever show.
3296820	3299820	Our first one went off really well, like, a good turnout,
3299820	3302820	and our guest was Rich Fulcher last month, and this month...
3302820	3303820	Oh, yeah.
3303820	3306820	It's Martin Olson, who you might know from Adventure Time, or...
3306820	3307820	You brought him a Spartan life.
3307820	3308820	Quite a guy.
3308820	3309820	Quite a guy.
3309820	3310820	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3310820	3312820	We did a skit with him before, where he was your dad,
3312820	3314820	and I'm asking for a date.
3314820	3315820	And then he beats the shit out of me.
3315820	3316820	No, he strangles me.
3316820	3317820	What does he do?
3317820	3318820	I don't know.
3318820	3319820	He's a good guy.
3319820	3322820	You guys ever go to Disneyland and go to Mickey's house in Toontown?
3322820	3325820	You wait and you meet Mickey Mouse?
3325820	3327820	I just did that for the first time with my girlfriend,
3327820	3331820	and as you're waiting in line there, there's these awesome cartoons
3331820	3335820	that are old, like, vintage-looking Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse things.
3335820	3336820	And that's Callie.
3336820	3337820	She made those things.
3337820	3340820	Well, I did a bunch of designs.
3340820	3342820	There was a whole team of people.
3342820	3344820	But the design is the whole point.
3344820	3346820	It's, like, beautifully designed.
3346820	3350820	It's, like, some of the coolest animation I've seen in a very long time.
3350820	3352820	Did you know it was her when you saw it?
3352820	3355820	I remember seeing clips of, like, stuff that you've posted online.
3355820	3356820	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3356820	3359820	And then I was watching it with Church, and I was like, oh, this is the thing
3359820	3360820	that Callie worked on.
3360820	3361820	Yeah.
3361820	3366820	It's, like, old, vintage, black-and-white Disney meets, like, Ren and Stimpy meets,
3366820	3368820	like, the Triplets of Belleville.
3368820	3370820	Like, it's really cool.
3370820	3374820	Yeah, the background team especially are, like, super, super amazing.
3374820	3375820	Is that Andy?
3375820	3376820	Andy Suriano?
3376820	3377820	Yeah, Andy Suriano.
3377820	3378820	He's great.
3378820	3379820	Ninja Turtles now.
3379820	3380820	Great guy.
3380820	3381820	He looks like Wolverine.
3382820	3387820	Suppose I'm a young Burbank hipster.
3387820	3390820	You just described me and Spencer.
3390820	3391820	Yeah.
3391820	3393820	I mean, you could pass for that.
3393820	3395820	Beard really does that.
3395820	3396820	What do you consider your thought?
3396820	3401820	Why should I come to whatever your show's called, which you should now tell us.
3401820	3402820	Well, it's because it's not film.
3402820	3407820	Wait, so to go back to the egotistical thing, it's called What About Me?
3407820	3410820	Which is about us going, well, what about me?
3410820	3413820	Every time someone ends a sentence, we're like, well, what about me?
3413820	3414820	And I'm important, too.
3414820	3415820	But, like, uh...
3415820	3418820	The birth of the show was that I was frustrated with Hollywood.
3418820	3419820	Yeah.
3419820	3423820	And I wanted to write and get people to see my comedy, so I was like, I'll just do a show
3423820	3426820	and, you know, make it with my friend who does great music.
3426820	3428820	Yeah, so it's like it's a true variety show.
3428820	3430820	And we'll just do a little tiny stuff.
3430820	3433820	What was the most frustrating thing about Hollywood for you?
3433820	3438820	Well, there's a lot of things, but mainly, like, I've pitched and I've...
3438820	3439820	Oh, also, you might know Abed.
3439820	3441820	He wrote a little bit on Rick and Morty.
3441820	3443820	He worked on the commercial episodes.
3443820	3444820	Oh, that's right.
3444820	3445820	Yeah, yeah.
3445820	3447820	And I had a hundred ideas, and they picked five.
3447820	3450820	It was the lack of you that frustrated you about Hollywood.
3450820	3451820	Oh, yeah.
3451820	3452820	Wait, why am I not in there?
3452820	3453820	No, no, not the lack of me.
3453820	3457820	The fact that I think I'm as good as Johnny Two-Tones over there, who's...
3457820	3461820	He's like, you know, I watch his career just spiraling out of control, and I'm like...
3461820	3462820	Yeah, I can do that.
3462820	3465820	Is Johnny Two-Tones here tonight?
3465820	3466820	I don't know.
3466820	3467820	He might be here.
3467820	3468820	You fucker!
3468820	3469820	Motherfucker!
3469820	3470820	Fuck you!
3470820	3471820	No, I mean, but look, I have...
3471820	3474820	You know, I feel like I can do that.
3474820	3477820	So I'm like, let me just do a show where I can do that.
3477820	3478820	I know executive is saying...
3478820	3479820	Stop!
3479820	3480820	That being a variable...
3480820	3481820	That's crazy.
3481820	3484820	I can't ask you, because I'm not going to start a beef between you and Johnny Pemberton,
3484820	3485820	or whoever it is you're...
3485820	3486820	No, Two-Tones.
3486820	3487820	No, he's a friend, actually.
3487820	3489820	I'm saying, like, we're not going to...
3489820	3493820	I'm not going to ask you to tell me who it is that you do think you're...
3493820	3494820	Please don't.
3494820	3496820	Yeah, please don't.
3496820	3497820	No, I mean...
3497820	3501820	The alternative for anybody who wanted to come to the show but was still on the fence,
3501820	3504820	going, like, gosh, maybe I do some...
3504820	3506820	Well, we have a lot of good special guests.
3506820	3511820	This month, besides Martin Olsen, we also have Mike McCafferty of 101 FAME and Star Trek
3511820	3514820	podcast on the Feral Audio Network.
3514820	3515820	Star Trek podcast is great.
3515820	3516820	I like the Rafa Khan one.
3516820	3518820	We were just guests on there.
3518820	3522820	And also, we will be having Becky Garcia, who's an adult swim writer.
3522820	3523820	She writes on these.
3523820	3524820	Yeah, she wrote on Hot Streets.
3524820	3525820	Yeah.
3525820	3527820	As of a couple days ago, I was in the show, but then I...
3527820	3528820	Yeah, sure.
3528820	3530820	Yeah, Jeff Davis was our special guest.
3530820	3531820	I screwed up and double-booked myself.
3531820	3532820	Oh, let's go.
3532820	3533820	We'll get you in a few months.
3533820	3537820	Abed, you in the show, like, because you can't...
3537820	3539820	You could say, Johnny Two-Tones, I can do what he can do.
3539820	3540820	Right.
3540820	3541820	And we can't have you...
3541820	3544820	We can't make you say, I mean, Vince Vaughn.
3544820	3550820	Like, so I'm asking you, what are you doing in the show that you're like,
3550820	3552820	fucking come see me do my thing, goddamn it?
3552820	3554820	Yeah, I'm like the Bob Odenkirk of the show.
3554820	3556820	I just kind of write stuff and I act and stuff.
3556820	3560820	But I don't give myself the main part, because I like to be on the sides.
3560820	3561820	And I like other people to...
3561820	3562820	Abed's the crazy part.
3562820	3565820	I want to extract their craziness in my own way.
3565820	3566820	And it's fun.
3566820	3568820	You know, last month, Fultur...
3568820	3569820	Well, Fultur...
3569820	3571820	There's a sort of script that Abed writes,
3571820	3574820	but he kind of just went off the rails and did improvise the whole section.
3574820	3576820	Yeah, Fultur really brought so much to it,
3576820	3578820	and he made it way better than I wrote.
3578820	3580820	So that was a great experience.
3581820	3582820	Because I like working with him.
3582820	3583820	Yeah.
3583820	3585820	It was like we both had a talk show where we're the host at the same time.
3585820	3588820	I saw Fultur like in 1994, I think, for the first time.
3588820	3589820	Oh, wow.
3589820	3590820	It was a comedy festival, and he came on stage.
3590820	3591820	It was a show he did.
3591820	3595820	I might have the date wrong, but it was called Modern Problems and Science
3595820	3596820	or something like that.
3596820	3600820	It was him and a couple other guys, and they would just get a theory.
3600820	3604820	And they would get three different schools of scientific thought,
3604820	3606820	and they would prove or just prove that theory.
3606820	3609820	And his was Russian literature, and he clearly didn't know...
3609820	3610820	Sounds like him.
3610820	3612820	He clearly had never read any Russian literature,
3612820	3615820	but committed to it so fucking hard that it was like...
3615820	3618820	I watched it. I go, that's the funniest improv I've ever seen.
3618820	3621820	Well, I met him because I was his stand-in on Crossballs,
3621820	3623820	hosted by Chris Tallman.
3623820	3625820	Because you guys have a similar kind of profile.
3625820	3628820	Well, I was his stand-in, and he heard about me being quite a...
3628820	3631820	I just was talking the whole time, and Matt Besser told me to shut up,
3631820	3634820	and it was like really crazy experience.
3634820	3638820	And then Fultur was like, oh, you're the guy that was my stand-in.
3638820	3640820	Everyone said you were weird.
3640820	3642820	You have a podcast with him, too.
3642820	3644820	I have a podcast with him on Feral Audio.
3644820	3646820	Can you keep doing your Rich Fultur impression?
3646820	3648820	It's because I see him so much.
3648820	3650820	Speaking of other superpowers,
3650820	3652820	I don't know how this will translate to a podcast,
3652820	3654820	but remember at a party one time,
3654820	3656820	you can do impressions of people, but not verbally.
3656820	3658820	Visual impressions.
3658820	3660820	He can embody you.
3660820	3662820	Yeah, I can embody you.
3662820	3664820	He'll do visual impressions of...
3664820	3666820	Do Dan Harmon.
3666820	3668820	Give us some Dan Harmon.
3668820	3670820	I got a lot of things to say about the president.
3670820	3672820	It's really crazy, because you guys are going to like what I say.
3672820	3674820	Okay, here we go.
3674820	3676820	The president, I mean...
3676820	3678820	You know...
3678820	3680820	He's a little fucked up.
3680820	3682820	Now do me. Do Jeff Davis.
3682820	3684820	The thing about it is...
3684820	3688820	So you do a character like Rich Fultur, and...
3688820	3690820	I just got to see it for a second.
3690820	3692820	Hold on.
3692820	3694820	Now do it now.
3694820	3696820	Now do Ted Knight.
3696820	3698820	Oh, Mary.
3698820	3700820	Oh, God.
3700820	3702820	Oh, Mary, what are you doing?
3702820	3704820	I'm of Ted Knight, and oh, Mary...
3704820	3706820	He's just like saying...
3706820	3708820	Can you do Callie?
3708820	3710820	Can you do a Callie?
3710820	3712820	Hey, what are you doing there?
3712820	3714820	Look out. We got a show to make.
3714820	3716820	Get to work.
3716820	3718820	She's Minnie Mouse.
3718820	3722820	She's easy to do, because she's a character.
3722820	3724820	You have to be a character. It's easier to do.
3724820	3730820	If you really Google acting with Abed, and you'll see a young Jeff and a young Dan.
3730820	3734820	They all turn on Abed, because Abed's trying to teach you guys acting.
3734820	3736820	You guys all...
3736820	3740820	You come after me because of a real conversation we had.
3740820	3742820	You're like...
3742820	3744820	I'm really intimidated by you.
3744820	3746820	Yeah, and I told you that at Rob's house.
3746820	3748820	And then Rob goes, don't say that.
3748820	3750820	Why are you saying that to him?
3750820	3752820	Do your Rob impression.
3752820	3754820	Give him some Rob Shroff.
3754820	3756820	Abed, what are you doing?
3756820	3758820	No, that's more like Ridley.
3758820	3760820	He's like, you gotta talk about his shit.
3760820	3770820	Abed, you and me and Kate are going to go to this restaurant, and we're going to learn about Doctor Who.
3770820	3772820	My favorite show.
3772820	3774820	And you're going to like it, God damn it.
3774820	3776820	You had it all the way.
3776820	3778820	My name's Rob Shroff, and I love taking shits.
3778820	3780820	No, I know.
3780820	3782820	But I was on camera, I was nervous.
3782820	3788820	And Rob made me nervous because he was sitting there, just judging me with his eyes, being like, you better be funny, you motherfucker.
3788820	3790820	And so, yeah, that was awkward.
3790820	3792820	Can you do Spencer?
3792820	3794820	Hey, guys.
3794820	3796820	We gotta move things along.
3796820	3798820	We gotta move things along, guys.
3798820	3802820	I can do Spencer. Spencer's like this.
3802820	3804820	I couldn't tell who did what there.
3804820	3806820	That was amazing.
3806820	3808820	Hey, how's it going?
3808820	3810820	She lives with me.
3810820	3812820	Not like that, though.
3812820	3814820	Or you live with me.
3814820	3816820	Oh, yeah, we're roommates.
3816820	3818820	There's a shoe.
3818820	3820820	Is Spencer a happy roommate?
3820820	3822820	He's like the best roommate I've probably ever had.
3822820	3824820	I would imagine he'd be a pretty good roommate.
3824820	3826820	Yeah, I know. I hope my old roommates aren't listening, but really.
3826820	3832820	My secret is I spend most of my life thinking I'm a terrible roommate.
3832820	3834820	Seriously?
3834820	3840820	You have the most adorable cat that I get to vicariously love.
3840820	3843820	She's got little short, stumpy legs, and she's super timid.
3843820	3845820	And this cat has its own comedy show.
3845820	3847820	She did.
3847820	3849820	What about me?
3849820	3851820	What about meow?
3851820	3853820	Yeah.
3853820	3855820	Oh, shit.
3855820	3857820	It's me.
3857820	3860820	I might have a black eye and a broken nose, but I still do the puns.
3860820	3863820	You're looking pretty good with a broken nose, by the way.
3863820	3865820	It's healed fast.
3865820	3867820	Last time I saw you, it was worse.
3867820	3869820	Yeah, it's getting better.
3869820	3871820	You're a good healer.
3871820	3873820	You're a big healer, Jeff.
3873820	3875820	He really knows how to heal this guy.
3875820	3877820	I know your way around it.
3877820	3880820	I did a doodle of your new characters, but I didn't finish it.
3880820	3882820	I'll post it online.
3882820	3885820	We'll put those up on the screen when we play.
3885820	3887820	That'd be awesome.
3887820	3889820	What are the action items?
3890820	3893820	For people that are in the area, when's the show?
3893820	3895820	What's it called?
3895820	3897820	What do the tickets cost?
3897820	3899820	You can go to starburnscastle.com to buy tickets.
3899820	3902820	It's this Thursday on July 6th, so after July 4th.
3902820	3904820	What about me?
3904820	3907820	What about me with Cali and Abed?
3907820	3909820	There's also music.
3909820	3912820	There's a wonderful musician, Chris Lynch, who's a friend of mine from New York.
3912820	3914820	I'm actually going to be doing a duet with him.
3914820	3916820	What song are you guys doing?
3916820	3918820	I'm not going to tell you the surprise.
3919820	3926820	I play music and I'm a singer-songwriter, so it's also a venue where not only I get to participate in the comedy,
3926820	3929820	and I let him run off the rails, but I get to do new songs.
3929820	3931820	I'm very lucky that she doesn't interfere with my comedy.
3931820	3933820	When I eventually come on the show, can I sing a song with you?
3933820	3935820	Of course. Are you kidding me? That would be wonderful.
3935820	3936820	You're a great singer.
3936820	3938820	I would love to do a country duet.
3938820	3940820	I love Rainy Night.
3940820	3942820	It's a great song.
3942820	3945820	You're a big Eddie Rabbit fan. We know a lot about you.
3945820	3947820	I tried.
3947820	3949820	But yeah, I know. Starburnscastle.com.
3949820	3952820	And just right here, where we are right now.
3952820	3954820	Let's hear for Callie and Abed, everybody.
3954820	3955820	Thank you, everybody.
3955820	3956820	Check out this show.
3956820	3957820	Thank you.
3957820	3958820	Thanks, guys.
3958820	3960820	Go to Harmon Town Castle.
3960820	3962820	What about me? Thank you, my love.
3962820	3966820	Also, find her artwork online. It's absolutely fantastic.
3966820	3969820	CallieKazoo.com?
3969820	3973820	She did a portrait of Roy Orbison for me that's hanging in my bathroom.
3974820	3975820	Yeah, her Instagram is awesome.
3975820	3980820	She's always doing the cute little Callie-looking things.
3980820	3982820	I'm not an artist. I don't know how to talk about it.
3982820	3985820	She draws like this really cute, kind of cutesy pie,
3985820	3987820	Disney pin-up girl kind of things.
3987820	3989820	But it's always about sadness and loneliness.
3989820	3992820	It's a lot of vomiting, a lot of crying.
3992820	3994820	It's very good.
3996820	4000820	I wonder if we have time just for a couple of Twitter questions here.
4000820	4002820	Oh, I hope we have time.
4002820	4006820	Somebody asked a really interesting question.
4006820	4010820	He said, if you had $1,000,
4010820	4014820	how much would you regret your life decisions?
4014820	4016820	I was like, oh, is that a joke?
4016820	4018820	I was like, oh, no, you mean if I was it?
4018820	4020820	Yeah, fuck. Oh, my God.
4020820	4025820	I was like, if I hadn't been as lucky in my life,
4025820	4029820	how much torture would I be inflicting on myself
4029820	4032820	for every fucking thing that I've ever done?
4032820	4034820	It's fucked up that we do that to ourselves
4034820	4039820	because I guarantee you the fact that I have more than $1,000
4039820	4041820	isn't the result of smart choices,
4041820	4044820	nor should I be patting myself on the back for the choices I made.
4044820	4046820	It's kind of two different things.
4046820	4050820	It's like two different graphs, like, oh, money got made,
4050820	4054820	but then also mental illness was explored.
4054820	4058820	And only because I don't have bad consequences
4058820	4061820	to blame on who I am am I able to say,
4061820	4063820	oh, those are two different things.
4063820	4067820	So if you're broke and you're nuts, go easy on yourself.
4067820	4069820	It's 9-11.
4069820	4072820	9-11. Oh, shit.
4072820	4074820	9-11.
4074820	4076820	For people that have never seen the show,
4076820	4078820	they were bitter before, that's...
4078820	4080820	Please don't think we're terrorists.
4080820	4081820	That's the thing that we do.
4081820	4083820	Spencer, do you want to dole out some character sheets?
4083820	4085820	We'll be right back.
4085820	4087820	Oh, yeah, let's take a mid-roll break
4087820	4089820	for a pre-recorded ad
4089820	4091820	during which the people that are in this space
4091820	4094820	and the people that paid $5 a month to watch
4094820	4097820	get a secret dance segment.
4097820	4098820	Damn.
4098820	4101820	Damn. Do an armpit fart.
4101820	4102820	Can you do it?
4102820	4105820	I've never been able to do armpit farts.
4105820	4107820	I'll do the shirt.
4107820	4109820	I can show everybody.
4109820	4110820	All right, and we're back.
4110820	4111820	No, no, no.
4111820	4114820	Oh.
4114820	4116820	I could show...
4116820	4117820	We're not back yet.
4117820	4119820	I'll show people the...
4119820	4120820	You know, that lady...
4120820	4122820	The last segment didn't get cut out
4122820	4124820	and any plebeians listened to it,
4124820	4126820	even though it was like bonus and not for them.
4126820	4128820	Well, there's some work to do at Feral Audio.
4128820	4129820	They'll figure out how to do it, right?
4129820	4132820	By the time that we actually make these segments worthwhile.
4132820	4133820	There.
4133820	4134820	I put...
4134820	4135820	You know, there was that lady.
4135820	4136820	She's like...
4136820	4137820	I can't remember where she is.
4137820	4138820	Oh, there.
4138820	4139820	There she is.
4139820	4140820	Remember her?
4140820	4141820	She was on Twitter a little while ago
4141820	4143820	because she was bragging about how we're spending less on...
4143820	4144820	Wait, what is this?
4144820	4146820	She's the ambassador to the U.N.
4146820	4147820	The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
4147820	4148820	So I was like, I don't know.
4148820	4149820	I'm going to put Levi's face on her
4149820	4151820	just to give the old iPad a try.
4151820	4153820	And then partway through it, I was like,
4153820	4154820	Hubba hubba, you know?
4154820	4158820	Like, nothing against her.
4158820	4160820	And we're enlightened now.
4160820	4161820	We're not going to judge women,
4161820	4163820	especially in politics, for their looks.
4163820	4166820	But I'm just saying, you throw Levi's face on...
4166820	4168820	I think we're finding out.
4168820	4171820	We found out he's a winter.
4171820	4172820	That's really his color.
4172820	4173820	And I have a type.
4173820	4176820	All right.
4176820	4178820	Okay, well, boy, we're back.
4178820	4184820	And man, oh, man, you should really pay $5 a month.
4184820	4186820	You guys want to look at my apps?
4186820	4191820	You guys want to hear a little bit of Pathfinder role-playing real fast?
4191820	4195820	Let's get Steve.
4195820	4197820	Oh, let's bring Steve Levi up here.
4197820	4208820	There's people sitting on the floor.
4208820	4213820	Did they pay less for their tickets?
4213820	4217820	I want to say hi real quick to Heather and Andrew Gray,
4217820	4223820	my ex-girlfriend's parents, who are here from Scotland, UK.
4223820	4224820	They're over there?
4224820	4226820	Are you still back there, Heather and Andrew?
4226820	4228820	Hello.
4228820	4230820	I think we owe you a thank-you and apology
4230820	4233820	because we went to their house when Dan was still with Aaron.
4233820	4237820	When Dan proposed to Aaron McGathey,
4237820	4241820	he had the ring in his pocket while we were at their house,
4241820	4244820	and we proceeded to drink all of their Scotch, all of their whiskey.
4244820	4248820	So I hope we give him some back, but I think we drank most of it.
4248820	4249820	I fucked up.
4249820	4251820	I'm not signed into our Slack.
4251820	4258820	Because I got a new 10.5-inch iPad, like an Apple douche.
4258820	4260820	But I don't have a car.
4260820	4263820	And the world is ending, and I can do what I want.
4263820	4268820	And I create jobs.
4268820	4272820	All right, Spencer, do you want to kick this off and go give us a little recap?
4272820	4274820	Yeah, I guess.
4274820	4276820	I seem very excited about it.
4276820	4278820	I always am.
4278820	4280820	Fuck, god damn it.
4280820	4282820	Son of a bitch.
4282820	4285820	I feel like maybe, I don't know.
4285820	4288820	Fuck.
4288820	4289820	Should I not?
4289820	4293820	I'm just thinking that there's a trend where I read this while Dan's occupied,
4293820	4296820	and I think we're playing into that trope if I start right now.
4296820	4297820	Thank you.
4297820	4299820	It's nice of you to notice.
4299820	4300820	I'm in the D&D channel.
4300820	4303820	Dan, do you want to put your little fidget spinner down for a minute while we do that?
4303820	4305820	No, no, he's...
4305820	4308820	Oh, yeah, I guess that is a solution.
4308820	4310820	Well, what's new in Steve's world?
4310820	4312820	Yeah, let's catch up with Levy for a moment.
4312820	4313820	You're wearing shorts.
4313820	4314820	Levy, you look great.
4314820	4315820	What the fuck's going on?
4315820	4316820	Damn.
4316820	4318820	You look fantastic in a nice wintery pink.
4318820	4319820	Did you know that?
4319820	4321820	I do now, I guess.
4321820	4323820	You look a little wiped out.
4323820	4326820	Your jacket looks tucked into your shorts.
4326820	4327820	Oh, no, it's not.
4327820	4328820	It's not, yeah.
4328820	4329820	You okay, Steve?
4329820	4330820	Yeah, just...
4330820	4331820	You a little tired?
4331820	4332820	A little tired.
4332820	4333820	What happened, long day?
4333820	4336820	Yeah, a long weekend, holiday weekend.
4336820	4338820	Yeah, just beginning.
4338820	4339820	Yeah.
4339820	4340820	Yeah.
4340820	4342820	Not for me, it doesn't feel that way.
4342820	4343820	No?
4343820	4344820	No.
4344820	4345820	You got to go back to work tomorrow?
4345820	4347820	Steve always works.
4347820	4351820	Spencer, actually, he covered for me all day Friday, and I love him for that.
4351820	4352820	Thank you.
4352820	4353820	Great.
4353820	4354820	Steve always works, unless he doesn't.
4354820	4359820	Okay, I have my character sheet up, and I'll just multitask between that and the slack
4360820	4363820	to look at the PDF of the spell sheet.
4363820	4369820	And, you know, every once in a while, I'll pass this photo of Levy and get a boner,
4369820	4378820	but that's just going to have to be, like, a little handicap that I...
4379820	4381820	A capability, a different ability.
4381820	4385820	Which picture do you think you could more successfully masturbate to,
4385820	4388820	the original of that woman or the edited Steve Levy one?
4388820	4393820	No, for sure the Levy one, because I know...
4393820	4394820	Yeah, for sure.
4394820	4396820	In my heart, I'll be like...
4397820	4398820	It's like she was...
4398820	4402820	You know, the only reason I ever photo is because she was bragging about the savings
4402820	4407820	that we've made by not caring enough as much about the UN.
4407820	4412820	And, Steve, which photo of Dan do you think would be the easiest to masturbate to?
4415820	4417820	Probably that one with his balls, right?
4418820	4421820	It's so easy to embarrass Steve Levy, it's almost unfair.
4421820	4424820	No, I know, it's great. That's why I brought him up.
4425820	4431820	Every group text, no matter what anybody says, it's like a hair trigger,
4431820	4433820	you're going to get the monkey with his...
4433820	4435820	The Cino Evil monkey.
4435820	4437820	You get shy monkeys, and if it's really embarrassing,
4437820	4441820	because there's also the thing that Cody and Dan, occasionally me,
4441820	4443820	there's a picture of Dan with his balls out.
4443820	4446820	It got worse a couple of weeks ago, Jeff.
4447820	4451820	Cody and I like to trick Steve into looking at my genitals.
4454820	4457820	Cody will take pictures of me in hotel rooms and stuff,
4457820	4462820	and then there was a hotel, and it had a thing that was like...
4462820	4465820	I don't know why it would have this, but it was like a thing that were...
4465820	4468820	No, it was a thing you put on your doorknob outside the hotel room.
4468820	4469820	I would say breakfast.
4469820	4470820	Because it means that you wanted...
4470820	4471820	You want breakfast?
4471820	4473820	They'll take your order or something.
4473820	4475820	Yeah, you fill it up before 6 a.m.
4475820	4477820	Before 6 a.m., you hang up your door.
4477820	4479820	But it was like, well, guess what's going through there?
4479820	4483820	And then it's just a circular hole that says breakfast.
4488820	4492820	You could just text somebody, you could just send that photo to somebody,
4492820	4494820	and you'd be tricking them into seeing it,
4494820	4497820	but it's funnier to be like, hey, Steve, I need those tax forms.
4497820	4499820	Have you seen the thing?
4499820	4503820	We were in the middle of the desert and some random bar doing work,
4503820	4506820	and Cody is texting me in the store with Dan,
4506820	4508820	and she's like, you know, we got to do this thing,
4508820	4510820	and hey, can you help me with this?
4510820	4512820	I'm going to send you some stuff that I need help on,
4512820	4515820	and then just this picture of Dan comes through.
4515820	4517820	We're sitting at the bar in public,
4517820	4522820	and it's three or four images in a row of him with his dick through the breakfast thing.
4522820	4523820	That kind of backfired, because it was like...
4523820	4524820	There was a guy...
4524820	4525820	There was a giant bar on these giant screens,
4525820	4528820	and it was just like in the timeline, and I'm like, aah!
4528820	4532820	And there was a guy next to Dan who clearly saw this picture,
4532820	4535820	this conservative misogynistic guy,
4535820	4540820	and we're laughing, and he commented on this laughing...
4540820	4541820	I don't know.
4541820	4543820	And then Dan got sucked into this horrible conversation.
4543820	4549820	I mean, didn't you guys at Starbirds recently have a sexual harassment worksheet?
4549820	4550820	Yeah.
4550820	4553820	We did.
4553820	4556820	How does this not qualify as full?
4556820	4558820	It's totally fine.
4558820	4560820	You obviously missed the meeting.
4561820	4566820	If it has to be unwelcome in order for it to be passed.
4566820	4569820	Exactly. It has to be unwelcome.
4569820	4572820	Also, technically, Cody sent it to me, so...
4572820	4573820	Okay.
4573820	4574820	She's not...
4574820	4575820	She doesn't work with me.
4575820	4577820	Dan had no involvement with that at all.
4577820	4580820	He didn't want you to see a picture of his dick going through the breakfast line.
4580820	4581820	I don't know.
4581820	4582820	I think Dan texted Cody like,
4582820	4585820	Yo, it would be funny if he sent that picture to Levy.
4585820	4586820	I don't want to see that photo.
4586820	4588820	I'm a little sad I wasn't on that group text,
4589820	4593820	but by the way, it was a preemptive sexual harassment seminar.
4593820	4595820	A lot of companies have them.
4595820	4596820	Yeah.
4596820	4598820	We were overdue probably, right?
4598820	4600820	Well, don't say that either.
4600820	4602820	I think it was right on time.
4602820	4604820	No, because we're so good at it.
4604820	4608820	A traditional educational thing to equip all of our employees
4608820	4611820	with the knowledge they need to make a safe environment.
4611820	4612820	Right.
4612820	4617820	It took you guys 45 minutes to make your next dick joke in front of everybody.
4617820	4618820	Well, yeah.
4618820	4621820	Everybody that works at a company that knows that those days are the days
4621820	4623820	that everyone is the grossest.
4623820	4625820	Because everybody has this camaraderie
4625820	4626820	and then they're like,
4626820	4627820	Oh, we're going to do the sexual harassment.
4627820	4629820	And then people start...
4629820	4632820	I'm above it.
4632820	4635820	Because then I have a separate meeting
4635820	4637820	where the lawyer comes in and goes like,
4637820	4638820	Okay, here's your meeting.
4638820	4639820	The management thing where they go,
4639820	4641820	Here's the number of ways you can get sued
4641820	4642820	and for how much money?
4642820	4643820	I'm like,
4643820	4645820	Oh, feminist.
4646820	4648820	I'm just like,
4648820	4652820	I was woke before I started talking to these people,
4652820	4654820	but now I'm like wide awake.
4654820	4656820	You're wide awake.
4656820	4657820	I'm like,
4657820	4658820	Five hour energy.
4658820	4660820	Who's feeling unsafe?
4662820	4664820	Spencer, you ready to go?
4664820	4665820	Yeah, sure.
4665820	4668820	Are you ready to rock here?
4668820	4671820	You should save that image to your photo stream.
4671820	4672820	Yeah.
4672820	4673820	What would that do?
4673820	4675820	You don't have to log into Slack that way.
4675820	4677820	Oh, I...
4677820	4678820	I...
4678820	4679820	I...
4679820	4680820	I...
4680820	4681820	I...
4681820	4682820	I...
4682820	4683820	I...
4683820	4686820	I needed to get into Slack for the spell loadouts.
4686820	4688820	I had this in my photo roll.
4688820	4689820	Got it.
4689820	4691820	You look nice tonight.
4692820	4693820	Wow.
4693820	4695820	You should wear more sweaters.
4697820	4699820	He's straight up harassing me.
4700820	4702820	This is the definition of harassment.
4702820	4703820	All right.
4703820	4704820	This is funny.
4705820	4707820	It's cut and dry.
4707820	4709820	It's not as gray as you might think.
4709820	4711820	It's also like technically one of the things you learned in the seminars.
4711820	4713820	Someone in this room couldn't make the case.
4713820	4714820	They're like,
4714820	4716820	Yeah, you could go to a lawyer and you could say,
4716820	4721820	I watched a conversation between Dan and Steve that made me feel unsafe
4721820	4722820	at a Harman Town show.
4722820	4726820	And you could think you might find the right lawyer.
4727820	4729820	I wouldn't put that out there.
4729820	4730820	All right, Spencer.
4731820	4732820	Take it away, Spencer.
4733820	4734820	All right.
4734820	4735820	Last...
4738820	4742820	Last time on Harman Town D&D.
4742820	4744820	You guys were in the town.
4744820	4748820	You had came to help because they had asked for your aid
4748820	4750820	and you showed up and punched a kid
4750820	4753820	because he was possessed by multiple entities.
4753820	4754820	Fake news.
4755820	4757820	This is why he won.
4757820	4761820	Then what happened was you left and you went and checked out some burnt out
4761820	4764820	buildings, finding some buried corpses.
4764820	4767820	Then you went to the church and talked to the church prior.
4767820	4769820	He was all weird and you're like,
4769820	4771820	Whoa, he was sad.
4771820	4773820	It was Tom.
4773820	4776820	Tom's the bad guy and you weren't buying it,
4776820	4778820	but Jeff was buying it and diarrhea.
4778820	4780820	Junior was there.
4781820	4782820	The end.
4784820	4786820	Yeah, we're like we're our third chapter in.
4786820	4792820	And because we did this the last time in a tent in the summer at a festival,
4792820	4795820	we're already into the whole thing.
4795820	4797820	I'm like, Oh, yeah, what did we do?
4797820	4799820	I remember we went to the fryer.
4799820	4802820	But then like, OK, so where are we?
4802820	4803820	We went back.
4803820	4805820	We got holy water from the fryer.
4805820	4807820	We went back to Tom's house.
4807820	4808820	Right.
4808820	4811820	And we tried to kick his door down eight times, but we couldn't do it.
4811820	4813820	Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
4813820	4817820	Yeah, because you kept rolling apparently ones or twos and we couldn't kick a door down.
4817820	4819820	Wait, put the music back on. Hold on.
4819820	4820820	I can't.
4820820	4822820	You want the music?
4824820	4829820	Jeff tried to burn the door down and then they started throwing rocks from the second floor
4829820	4831820	and everybody took damage.
4831820	4832820	All right.
4832820	4833820	Now it's got it.
4833820	4834820	And that's currently where we are.
4834820	4835820	We're on the outside of the house.
4835820	4836820	Yeah, you're outside.
4836820	4837820	I'm at the back door.
4837820	4841820	Jeff tried to burn it down and then Steve put the water.
4841820	4844820	He put his water skin on it to put the fire out.
4844820	4847820	And Dan tried to kick it down, kick down a door.
4847820	4851820	And then you guys tried to kick down the door and they're throwing stuff at you.
4851820	4853820	Are we in a combat situation right now?
4853820	4855820	Yeah, you're in a combat situation.
4855820	4856820	All right.
4858820	4860820	You're in the back of the house.
4860820	4861820	Right.
4861820	4862820	Right.
4862820	4863820	Carlos.
4863820	4864820	I call out to Carlos.
4864820	4866820	Carlos, come back out to the front of the house.
4866820	4869820	We're getting rocks thrown at us and I need your help.
4869820	4870820	OK.
4872820	4875820	I want to climb to the window.
4875820	4876820	Yeah.
4876820	4877820	All right.
4877820	4879820	I got to get my dice.
4885820	4888820	I wish I had like sexy stripper music.
4888820	4889820	You guys do stuff.
4889820	4894820	It's like when an 80s wrestler gets his snake out of the bag.
4897820	4898820	Which 80s wrestler, Dan?
4898820	4899820	All right.
4899820	4900820	I'm sorry.
4900820	4901820	I didn't.
4901820	4902820	The snake man.
4902820	4903820	I don't know.
4903820	4904820	I wasn't part of that culture.
4904820	4905820	Jake the snake.
4905820	4906820	Well, how invent is.
4909820	4910820	I'm sorry.
4910820	4913820	Should we just say that I'm doing loadout one just to keep things simple because I keep
4913820	4915820	fucking up with my I didn't you know.
4915820	4916820	Yeah.
4916820	4917820	OK.
4917820	4920820	Because we have been using loadout one and we still are.
4920820	4921820	OK.
4921820	4923820	No, it's important to establish that.
4923820	4924820	Yeah.
4924820	4925820	You climb up the house.
4925820	4928820	You're on the second floor window.
4928820	4929820	Steve.
4929820	4930820	You did you.
4930820	4933820	I climbed into the house because we couldn't open the door.
4933820	4935820	He he he's being a man of action now.
4935820	4936820	Finally.
4936820	4937820	Like after after putting up the fire.
4937820	4939820	I said to try to burn the door down.
4939820	4941820	I just want to know did he do that in the front.
4941820	4944820	Where were you in relation to the front door.
4944820	4945820	I'm sorry.
4946820	4947820	Yeah.
4947820	4948820	Sorry.
4948820	4949820	It hasn't been my turn yet.
4949820	4951820	Well you came around your turn happened first.
4951820	4953820	You came around to the front door.
4953820	4956820	Then Steve climbed the wall.
4956820	4957820	OK.
4957820	4958820	Careful.
4960820	4963820	I say to to Carlos.
4964820	4966820	Hey this door is probably about to give in.
4966820	4967820	Kick this door down.
4967820	4968820	You're stronger than I am.
4971820	4972820	Me.
4972820	4973820	Oh shit.
4973820	4974820	You are.
4974820	4975820	You are.
4975820	4976820	Yes.
4976820	4977820	All right.
4978820	4980820	Silver flame guide my foot.
4981820	4984820	It guides it directly into the door.
4984820	4986820	You kick it and nothing happens.
4986820	4987820	Jesus Christ.
4988820	4989820	What is this door?
4989820	4990820	It's a really strong door.
4990820	4993820	I don't know but I think this is the fourth attempt to kick down this door.
4994820	4995820	Is it weakening at all.
4995820	4998820	Can we tell that it's maybe giving in a little bit.
4998820	4999820	No.
4999820	5004820	Your your attempts have made it seem like this door is made out of iron or some shit.
5005820	5006820	Even though you could tell it's not.
5008820	5009820	All right.
5009820	5010820	I am.
5010820	5014820	I use my chalalie because I have a.
5015820	5018820	My quarterstaff as a plus one weapon damage to D6.
5018820	5021820	So I I just give it a full.
5021820	5022820	Oh no.
5022820	5024820	I shoot a fire bolt through my.
5024820	5028820	I use my weapon domain and I shoot fire through my chalalie at the door.
5028820	5030820	You shoot a fire bolt.
5030820	5031820	What do I have.
5031820	5032820	What shoots out of my.
5032820	5034820	You can shoot all sorts of things.
5034820	5035820	All sorts of places.
5036820	5040820	I shoot a magical like actual flame at the door.
5040820	5041820	Yeah.
5041820	5043820	Well you have multiple spells that shoot fire.
5043820	5046820	Fire bolt is a spell or is a thing you could do.
5046820	5047820	That could be the answer.
5047820	5048820	I just want to make sure.
5048820	5049820	Okay.
5049820	5050820	Yeah.
5050820	5051820	Fireball.
5051820	5052820	Okay.
5052820	5053820	Sorry.
5053820	5054820	You do that.
5054820	5055820	You shoot it.
5055820	5056820	It starts burning.
5056820	5059820	It's burning and now Steve's on the second floor.
5059820	5062820	So it's not going to put itself out with water.
5062820	5067820	But again it will take a while because fire is not you know it's a thick door.
5067820	5069820	It takes a while to burn a door down.
5069820	5070820	Yeah.
5070820	5071820	Yeah.
5071820	5072820	I step back after that and so I'm out of rock.
5072820	5074820	The door is on fire.

5167820	5169820	Not only did did he not.
5169820	5170820	But if you did it's fine.

5203820	5205820	It's like as clerics go you know we don't.
5205820	5207820	We don't spend a lot of time with the gym.
5207820	5208820	And so.
5208820	5209820	Sorry.
5209820	5210820	What.

5216820	5217820	Yeah.
5217820	5218820	It's in a bottle.
5218820	5219820	Oh you're right.
5219820	5220820	Your jar.
5220820	5221820	That's right.
5221820	5222820	It's in my jar.
5222820	5223820	Because Dan would have dropped it.
5223820	5224820	But I have some too.
5224820	5225820	You and I both have.
5225820	5226820	Okay.
5226820	5227820	Yeah.
5227820	5228820	Now I remember.
5228820	5229820	But Dan used his.
5229820	5230820	Is it my turn.
5230820	5231820	No.
5232820	5233820	All right.
5233820	5235820	So I'm going to.
5237820	5239820	Because the door is on fire.
5239820	5240820	Is there a window.
5240820	5243820	We could just go in and not deal with this crazy ass door.
5243820	5245820	You could climb through the window.
5245820	5246820	I climb through.
5246820	5248820	I'm just going to kick the flaming door.
5248820	5249820	Okay.
5252820	5253820	It's round five.
5254820	5255820	All right.
5255820	5256820	You kick in the flaming door.
5256820	5257820	Kick it in?
5257820	5258820	Yeah.
5258820	5259820	Yeah.
5262820	5263820	That's.
5263820	5264820	That's the level we've been reduced to.
5264820	5266820	They're cheering that we did one thing.
5266820	5267820	Right.
5267820	5268820	Yeah.
5268820	5270820	We tried for an hour to kick this fucking door.
5270820	5273820	You wouldn't be cheering if you were the family that lived here.
5273820	5277820	Like they haven't really technically done anything to deserve this yet.
5277820	5278820	We don't know that.
5278820	5279820	All right.
5279820	5280820	We don't know that.
5280820	5282820	But that's when you shouldn't kick in there.
5282820	5283820	Exactly.
5284820	5285820	All right.
5285820	5286820	Okay.
5286820	5288820	So you kick in the door and it flies off its hinges.
5288820	5291820	It lands on the ground smoldering and firing.
5291820	5292820	We're here to help.
5294820	5296820	You not be a piece of shit.
5296820	5297820	I see Tom.
5297820	5298820	Is Tom there?
5298820	5299820	No.
5299820	5300820	He's upstairs.
5300820	5301820	Okay.
5301820	5302820	I run upstairs.
5302820	5303820	All right.
5303820	5304820	Wait.
5304820	5305820	Steve's turn.
5305820	5306820	Sorry.
5306820	5307820	It's okay.
5308820	5311820	I go into their kid's bedroom.
5311820	5312820	All right.
5312820	5313820	Well, Tom.
5313820	5314820	Tom's.
5315820	5317820	Just that as a time code here.
5317820	5319820	If you want to make a gif.
5329820	5332820	Well, Tom's Tom's in the window.
5332820	5336820	He's like you're kind of outside the house and he's on the inside of the house.
5336820	5337820	So I didn't climb into the house.
5337820	5339820	No, you're on the outside of the house.
5339820	5341820	Oh, he's like threatening it.
5341820	5343820	Well, like he was trying to stab you.
5343820	5348820	Well, I want to do a move where I like jump to the window and kick him.
5348820	5349820	All right.
5350820	5355820	You jump through the window and you try to kick him, but you just jump in the window.
5358820	5363820	Now you're inside, but you know, your kick missed any like whirls around.
5363820	5364820	He's like, wow.
5364820	5365820	All right.
5365820	5367820	Jeff's turn now.
5367820	5369820	I run upstairs to that room.
5369820	5370820	All right.
5370820	5371820	You do that.
5372820	5373820	Is the door open?
5374820	5378820	Where you are, where Steve is, is kind of like the landing of the house.
5378820	5379820	It's not a room.
5379820	5380820	It's just kind of open.
5380820	5383820	So that's you're both standing in that.
5383820	5386820	And then there's two closed bedroom doors.
5387820	5389820	Do I know which one Tom is in?
5389820	5392820	You know, which one was the kid's room because you were there.
5392820	5393820	Okay.
5393820	5394820	I opened that door.
5394820	5395820	All right.
5395820	5396820	You do that.
5396820	5397820	Is that the end of my turn?
5397820	5398820	The kid you see the kid.
5398820	5400820	He's he's he's still belted to bed.
5400820	5403820	He doesn't seem awake, but Tom's not there.
5403820	5405820	No, Tom is in the landing with Steve.
5405820	5407820	Can I keep looking or is that the end of my action?
5407820	5408820	What are you looking for?
5408820	5409820	Tom.
5409820	5410820	He's with Steve.
5410820	5411820	He's on the way.
5411820	5412820	So I was just there.
5412820	5413820	Yeah.
5413820	5414820	Okay.
5414820	5415820	I take out my holy water and throw it at him.
5415820	5416820	All right.
5416820	5417820	It hits him.
5417820	5418820	Wait, does it hit him?
5418820	5420820	It hits him right in the eye.
5426820	5428820	You see, you see the weight.
5428820	5431820	What kind of what is what is the holy water in?
5431820	5432820	Like a lion's skin.
5432820	5434820	I just squeeze it and squirt it at him.
5434820	5435820	Okay.
5437820	5440820	I swear I had a five gallon drum of it somewhere.
5440820	5442820	You had holy water, but you used it.
5442820	5445820	And I think you marked it off in your sheet, but you don't have the current sheet.
5445820	5446820	I just got a call back.
5446820	5448820	Oh, sorry, everybody.
5448820	5449820	Right.
5449820	5451820	Because the spark this guy stole your holy water.
5451820	5452820	Sorry.
5452820	5453820	Your fault.
5453820	5454820	My joke didn't land.
5454820	5455820	They would.
5455820	5456820	They would have laughed.
5456820	5457820	I'm sorry.
5458820	5461820	Um, no, uh, what?
5461820	5462820	Sorry.

5463820	5465820	I, I, I like, like take my wife.
5465820	5466820	Right in the eye.
5466820	5467820	Yeah.
5467820	5470820	He stumbles backwards and lands on his back.
5470820	5475820	Um, he's like, ah, ah, water's in my eye.
5475820	5478820	See, that's the thing about hitting him in the eye with the holy water.
5478820	5483820	You still don't know if they're evil because they're like, ah, there's water in my eye.
5483820	5485820	I was so sure that he was evil.
5485820	5491820	Lesh doesn't, um, you know, like steam, like a vampires or whatever, you know?
5491820	5495820	And by the way, met, met a gaming table talk, but the fucking guy that we talked to, the
5495820	5497820	fryer had shit all over his face.
5497820	5500820	I'm not saying that makes you a bad person, but he was like paranoid and crazy.
5500820	5501820	All right.
5501820	5503820	I don't know if he had shit all over his face.
5503820	5505820	Also, you did throw holy water at him.
5505820	5506820	The fryer?
5506820	5507820	Yeah.
5507820	5508820	Oh yeah.
5508820	5509820	That's right.
5509820	5510820	Yeah.
5510820	5511820	I've kind of, see, this is what I do.
5511820	5512820	I alienate.
5512820	5513820	So that was great.
5513820	5515820	That was so much fun.
5515820	5517820	Go back and listen to that.
5517820	5518820	Oh, I will.
5518820	5519820	Okay.
5519820	5520820	Oh yeah.
5520820	5523820	The holy water has no effect other than just being water in this guy's eyeballs.
5523820	5524820	No.
5524820	5525820	Yeah.
5525820	5526820	Well, it knocked him over.
5526820	5528820	The holy water, the force of the holy water knocked him over.
5528820	5529820	Yeah.
5529820	5530820	Hit him right in the eye and he fell backwards.
5530820	5531820	Hit him in the eye.
5531820	5532820	I mean, you of all people should know.
5532820	5535820	I didn't, a guy punched me in a cave concert.
5535820	5536820	I didn't fall down.
5536820	5539820	I just spilled my drinks and blood all over my suit.
5539820	5541820	I'm sorry.
5541820	5542820	Yeah.
5542820	5545820	And we spent the episode talking about Ovid.
5545820	5546820	Yeah.
5546820	5549820	You know, he talked to a guy while he was asleep.
5549820	5550820	Yeah.
5550820	5555820	Um, I, it's probably the end of my turn.
5555820	5556820	You can move, but yeah.
5556820	5558820	I get on top of him and try to subdue him.
5558820	5561820	Like I take some rope out and try to like bind him.
5561820	5562820	All right.
5562820	5563820	Well, you go to do that.
5563820	5565820	You can't quite start, but you get in his space.
5565820	5567820	So you're kind of like threatening him, you know?
5567820	5568820	Yeah.
5568820	5569820	All right.
5569820	5570820	He just starts crying.
5570820	5571820	He doesn't try and fight or anything anymore.
5571820	5572820	He just starts crying.
5572820	5575820	Okay.
5575820	5577820	Is it?
5577820	5578820	Whose term?
5578820	5579820	Dan.
5579820	5580820	Sorry.
5580820	5581820	Uh, what's this?
5581820	5582820	I only know this guy's name is Tom, right?
5582820	5583820	It's Tom Fel.
5583820	5584820	Tom Fel.
5584820	5585820	He fell from grace.
5585820	5587820	He's a, he's a, we think he's a baddie.
5587820	5590820	Tom Fel of what's the town's name?
5590820	5591820	Rohn.
5591820	5595820	Tom Fel of Rohn.
5595820	5597820	You have many enemies.
5597820	5599820	We might be your only friends.
5599820	5603820	You must tell us the truth.
5603820	5604820	Uh, he's just crying.
5604820	5606820	He's like, whatever.
5606820	5608820	Just leave me alone.
5608820	5611820	Leave us alone.
5611820	5613820	That never works.
5613820	5614820	Yeah.
5614820	5617820	You look around.
5617820	5619820	So I spent my, I spent my turn.
5619820	5621820	No, you can still do some talking.
5621820	5626820	Well, uh, I just want to, uh, uh, what if I, okay.
5626820	5627820	Okay.
5627820	5632820	Some sort of clerical healing or like evil casting out kind of abilities or no.
5632820	5635820	Well, you know, I'm not.
5635820	5637820	Look, let me try.
5637820	5643820	Is he damaged to the point where like, can I like, don't I have like, uh, like,
5643820	5647820	like maybe I can get in this guy's good graces with like, just to make him
5647820	5651820	understand that, that we're, we're civil servants, you know?
5651820	5658820	Like if I were to go, if I were to just, you know, wait, where's the, okay.
5658820	5661820	Like, uh, what is it?
5661820	5666820	Well, if I just use that channel thing and I just go, can I just heal him?
5666820	5668820	Yeah.
5668820	5669820	He's not, he's not damaged.
5669820	5670820	Yeah.
5670820	5673820	He feels healed though.
5673820	5676820	I go, I got, hey man, you all right?
5676820	5678820	What are you doing?
5678820	5681820	Look, there's something crazy going on in this town.
5681820	5682820	Like everybody's.
5682820	5683820	Yeah.
5683820	5686820	There's a fucking nightmare church that's bursting into people's houses and not
5686820	5688820	healing sick people.
5688820	5690820	Is this not the first time this has happened to you?
5690820	5698820	No, this is the second time you have been here this evening.
5698820	5705820	That feeling when your trail of clues leads back to you.
5705820	5706820	Yeah.
5706820	5708820	We're so bad at this.
5708820	5710820	What's the, what's the kid doing?
5710820	5711820	The kid is in the room.
5711820	5713820	He's, he's in the bedroom.
5713820	5716820	Is he, is he, does he still seem evil?
5716820	5717820	Does he still seem evil?
5717820	5718820	Who are you asking?
5718820	5722820	Uh, the you.
5722820	5723820	He's, well, he's in the bed.
5723820	5724820	He's not on the landing with us.
5724820	5725820	He's in the bedroom.
5725820	5727820	He's asking you is in the landing.
5727820	5728820	He's with everyone.
5728820	5730820	We tried holy water on the kid before, right?
5730820	5733820	Dan missed, but then I mopped his brow with, with the thing.
5733820	5734820	And that didn't kind of didn't do much, right?
5734820	5735820	It did some damage to him.
5735820	5740820	Oh, I mean, we can damage the kid all we want.
5740820	5745820	Like we're, we're great at that.
5745820	5746820	Diarrhea, go check on the kid.
5746820	5748820	I walk into the room where the kid is.
5748820	5749820	All right.
5749820	5751820	The kid seems asleep.
5751820	5756820	Oh, well, where's the wife?
5756820	5760820	Does he, does he look, does he seem sick?
5760820	5761820	He seems asleep.
5761820	5763820	He doesn't, yeah, he doesn't seem healthy.
5763820	5764820	Is Bonnie the wife there?
5764820	5765820	Who's got eyes on the wife?
5765820	5766820	You don't see the wife.
5766820	5767820	No one sees the wife.
5767820	5768820	I need a 10 on the wife.
5768820	5769820	Wait, 10?
5769820	5772820	So wait, Jeff hit the kid in the eye with holy water and he's now asleep?
5772820	5775820	No, Jeff hit the Tom in the eye with the water.
5775820	5776820	Oh, okay.
5776820	5782820	Well, I want to take my glass jar of holy water and pour it on the kid.
5782820	5783820	All right.
5783820	5786820	Isn't he the one that's like sort of possessed?
5786820	5787820	Yeah.
5787820	5788820	What?
5788820	5789820	I can't hear you.
5789820	5790820	I'm on the landing.
5790820	5793820	He gets experience points for doing that.
5793820	5794820	Who?
5794820	5795820	Dan?
5795820	5796820	Dan, for knowing that he couldn't hear me.
5796820	5797820	Yeah.
5797820	5799820	You get experience points for being on the landing.
5799820	5802820	Wait, wait, wait, Jeff.
5802820	5803820	Yes.
5803820	5804820	Let's sidebar here.
5804820	5805820	I mean, who's Jeff?
5805820	5806820	Oh, fuck.
5806820	5807820	Whoa.
5807820	5809820	Jeff gets experience points.
5809820	5811820	Who's this, Jeff?
5811820	5812820	Chad.
5812820	5814820	Chad, Chad, Chad, Chad.
5814820	5816820	Steve gets experience points.
5816820	5819820	What if, look, I don't know how holy water works.
5819820	5822820	I've never used it for anything like this before.
5822820	5823820	Yeah.
5823820	5829220	Do you think we should hold him down and chain him to the bed and then make him drink the
5829220	5830220	holy water?
5830220	5831220	I think he's already belted to the bed.
5831220	5832220	He's already belted to the bed.
5832220	5833220	Oh, okay.
5833220	5834220	Good.
5834220	5835220	Yeah.
5835220	5836220	Just get in there and do your thing.
5836220	5837220	Go nuts up there.
5837220	5838220	Follow your heart, diarrhea junior.
5838220	5839220	No wrong answers.
5839220	5840220	All right.
5840220	5841220	All right.
5841220	5842220	Are you calling out to me?
5842220	5843220	Wait.
5843220	5844220	You're not in the room?
5844220	5845220	No.
5845220	5846220	I'm in the landing.
5846220	5848220	But I hear him and I go into the room with him.
5848220	5849220	It's a small house.
5849220	5850220	It's a small house.
5850220	5851220	Okay.
5851220	5853220	Come in here and help me hold this kid's mouth open.
5853220	5858220	I go to the kid and I pry his jaw open in his head and hold his mouth open.
5858220	5860220	I take out my glass jar.
5860220	5865220	I pop open the lid and I start pouring it down his throat.
5865220	5866220	All right.
5866220	5867220	All right.
5867220	5870220	That happens.
5870220	5875220	That happens.
5875220	5878220	We wait with wild expectation to see with the results.
5878220	5880220	You should close his mouth and make him swallow.
5880220	5883220	I close it and shake his head like a popper in Mexico.
5883220	5884220	You do that.
5884220	5886220	He starts frothing.
5886220	5891220	Steam starts shooting out of his body.
5891220	5894220	Steam starts shooting out of his body.
5894220	5899220	And you feel a sharp, terrible pain in your, what do you call it, ankles.
5900220	5903220	You forgot ankles.
5903220	5904220	All right.
5904220	5906220	You remembered ankles.
5906220	5908220	So we didn't have a 20 on the wife.
5908220	5909220	Yeah.
5909220	5914220	A knife shoots out and stabs you in the legs for three damage.
5914220	5917220	Each of you take three damage.
5917220	5919220	Is she under the bed?
5919220	5920220	Yeah.
5920220	5921220	God damn it.
5921220	5924220	When you do a raid, you always look for the wife.
5924220	5927220	They get a homestead instinct.
5927220	5928220	Riles them up.
5928220	5931220	They'll take you out like Rambo.
5931220	5932220	How much damage did I take?
5932220	5933220	You take three.
5933220	5934220	Jesus Christ.
5934220	5935220	I'm getting killed over here.
5935220	5936220	All right.
5936220	5943220	The demon spawn child starts thrashing and sizzling and frothing madly
5943220	5945220	and spasming all over the place.
5945220	5949220	You see a black spirit erupt from its mouth.
5949220	5950220	It's all weird.
5950220	5956220	It looks like a flat, dark colored ghost silhouette kind of shadowy thing.
5957220	5961220	And right after that happens, you see the ghost kid kind of burst out of it
5961220	5964220	and it starts like it's wailing on the demon.
5964220	5965220	It's like punching at the demon.
5965220	5970220	And they're just kind of wrestling on the floor, these two immaterial creatures.
5970220	5973220	Is that the ghost of the brother that we saw from earlier?
5973220	5974220	What was it?
5974220	5975220	Archer.
5975220	5976220	Yeah.
5976220	5977220	It's the ghost you saw in the past.
5977220	5980220	So Archer is now fighting a demon ghost that's emanating.
5980220	5983220	They're both emanating from Cliff.
5983220	5984220	They have emanated.
5984220	5985220	Now they're done being emanated.
5985220	5986220	But yes.
5986220	5987220	They're out fighting.
5987220	5988220	Yeah.
5988220	5989220	Physically out in the room right now.
5989220	5990220	Oh, yeah.
5990220	5991220	They're duking it out.
5991220	5992220	Oh, man.
5992220	5996220	The production values are great.
5996220	5998220	I'm just cradling Tom on the landing.
5998220	5999220	This is going.
5999220	6000220	It's going to be cool, man.
6000220	6002220	Sometimes shit, you know, life doesn't...
6002220	6006220	Why don't you just, you know, come back in the morning or something?
6006220	6007220	Look.
6007220	6009220	Or not burst down the door.
6009220	6011220	Or not light the house on fire.
6011220	6012220	Wait, so you guys put the house out?
6012220	6015220	I think there's a burning door downstairs.
6015220	6017220	You smell smoke real bad.
6017220	6019220	I'll take care of that.
6019220	6021220	But before I do, I want to say this.
6021220	6022220	No offense.
6022220	6026220	But I don't get the impression from where you live that you haven't made mistakes in your
6026220	6029220	life.
6029220	6030220	You're right.
6030220	6034220	Every citizen should live a perfect life in order to not be murdered by the state.
6034220	6035220	That's not what I said.
6035220	6039220	Don't put words in my mouth.
6039220	6041220	I don't come to where you live.
6041220	6042220	No, I agree.
6042220	6043220	I do come to where you live.
6043220	6044220	Yes, you do.
6044220	6045220	Yes.
6045220	6047220	You do that twice a night, apparently.
6047220	6048220	All right.
6048220	6049220	You're not even...
6049220	6050220	No, I agree.
6050220	6051220	I'm agreeing with you.
6051220	6052220	Okay.
6052220	6053220	Well, where's your water?
6053220	6054220	What?
6054220	6057220	There's water to put out the fire in your house I started.
6057220	6059220	It's in the well.
6059220	6060220	It's no well?
6060220	6061220	It's in the well.
6061220	6062220	Uh-oh.
6062220	6063220	We live on a farm.
6063220	6064220	All right.
6064220	6067220	Well, do you have any people that can go get some...
6067220	6068220	Fuck.
6068220	6069220	Well, my wife is under the...
6069220	6070220	Do you have a bucket?
6070220	6071220	Is there a bucket at the...
6071220	6072220	Yeah.
6072220	6073220	There's a bucket.
6073220	6074220	All right.
6074220	6075220	Well, come with me.
6075220	6076220	I don't want you running around like a...
6076220	6077220	There's a plan.
6077220	6079220	He grabs the bucket and runs outside.
6079220	6081220	I assume you're following him?
6081220	6082220	Yeah.
6082220	6083220	Yeah.
6083220	6084220	He just does it normally and starts...
6084220	6085220	He throws the bucket of water.
6085220	6086220	He puts out the fire.
6086220	6087220	Oh.
6087220	6088220	It's nondescript.
6088220	6089220	Teamwork.
6089220	6090220	Yeah.
6090220	6091220	I hollered down.
6091220	6096620	I said, hey, we got a ghost fight up here and a lady just cut my ankles from underneath
6096620	6097620	the bed.
6098620	6100620	We got a code 14 up here.
6100620	6103620	Well, you're doing it all in a house that ain't on fire.
6109620	6112620	And there's like a Voltron split screen.
6115620	6116620	We're all working together.
6116620	6117620	Synergy.
6117620	6119620	That's great.
6119620	6120620	We could call it...
6120620	6121620	Let's keep going, though, right?
6121620	6122620	All right.
6122620	6124620	Tom, I'm going to head upstairs because I'm a cleric.
6124620	6126620	Sounds like shit's going down with your haunted son.
6126620	6128620	Yeah.
6128620	6130620	Who's the best church in the world?
6132620	6133620	All right.
6133620	6134620	You know what?
6134620	6135620	We'll sell you later.
6135620	6136620	Yeah.
6136620	6137620	I head upstairs.
6137620	6138620	Okay.
6138620	6141620	I fill him in and say, oh, by the way, we poured holy water down this kid's mouth.
6141620	6142620	The mom is angry.
6142620	6143620	She's underneath the bed.
6143620	6146620	She just sliced us and the ankles like a prison fight.
6146620	6147620	Okay.
6147620	6148620	Are the spirits emanating?
6148620	6149620	They're already emanated.
6149620	6150620	Oh, interesting.
6150620	6151620	They're...
6151620	6153620	This is post-emination.
6153620	6154620	Okay.
6154620	6155620	All right.
6155620	6157620	I mean, look, I don't want to point out the obvious.
6157620	6164620	I don't want a ghost's plane, but there's a ghost fighting what we think is the spirit
6164620	6169620	of the dead brother, Archer, and they're duking it out on the mortal plane right now.
6169620	6170620	All right.
6170620	6175620	Well, I think we should help the good ghost.
6175620	6177620	Are you bleeding from your ankle?
6177620	6178620	Yeah, I took three damage.
6178620	6181620	I eat a good berry.
6181620	6182620	Wait, do you...
6182620	6184620	Yeah, I eat some good berries.
6184620	6185620	Okay.
6185620	6187620	Do I see Bonnie?
6187620	6190620	No, you don't see anything under the bed.
6190620	6192620	How much healing do I take from the good berries?
6192620	6196620	Well, each good berry you eat gives you one health, so it's up to you how many you want
6196620	6197620	to eat.
6197620	6199620	I eat three.
6199620	6201620	Then you gain three health.
6201620	6202620	Okay.
6202620	6204620	So I'm good to go.
6204620	6209620	I mean, I got to get some new socks tomorrow, but I'm...
6209620	6213620	I mean, as long as we're still talking, who cut your ankles?
6213620	6215620	It's a crazy lady under the bed.
6215620	6216620	I mean...
6216620	6217620	There's a lady under the bed?
6217620	6218620	Yeah, the mom.
6218620	6222620	I mean, she might be just protecting her family, but it's a weird instinct to have a knife
6222620	6224620	underneath a bed.
6224620	6226620	I don't really like her style.
6226620	6227620	Yeah.
6227620	6231620	I mean, seriously, we need to keep an eye on her.
6231620	6235620	We have to keep, you know, just don't get too close to the bed.
6235620	6239620	Diarrhea, get the lady out from under the bed.
6239620	6241620	I look under the bed for the lady.
6241620	6242620	All right.
6242620	6244620	Well, describe that action.
6244620	6246620	Don't look with your face.
6246620	6247620	I don't...
6249620	6253620	I'm like, you know, like five feet away, and I look to see if she's under there.
6253620	6254620	Yeah, she's under there.
6254620	6257620	She's crouched up like a big green tarantula.
6257620	6265620	All right, so I take my slingshot and I load it up, and I shoot her in the head.
6265620	6266620	Shit.
6270620	6272620	Not hard, just like, you know, like...
6272620	6274620	We have no wrong answers.
6274620	6275620	What's your attack bonus on the slingshot?
6275620	6277620	Do you see that?
6277620	6278620	Plus four.
6278620	6279620	All right, you hit her.
6279620	6281620	You hit her in the face.
6281620	6282620	All right.
6282620	6284620	With what, like a rock or a rock?
6284620	6289620	And while she's in pain, I want to pull her out front of the bed.
6289620	6291620	All right, that happens.
6292620	6297620	All right, guys, I think I have it under control.
6298620	6301620	Can we do like a perception check on her or like a sense of motive?
6301620	6305620	Like, is she evil or is she just being a good mom?
6305620	6306620	You know what?
6306620	6308620	Save your dice.
6308620	6310620	She's a mother.
6311620	6313620	Home is being invaded.
6313620	6315620	She has a knife under the bed?
6315620	6318620	She's just doing the best she can with what she's got.
6319620	6321620	I don't care if she is evil.
6321620	6324620	She's going to do the same thing as if she's good.
6324620	6327620	She's either a great mom or Steven Seagal.
6329620	6330620	Either way.
6331620	6333620	She seems normal, you know.
6334620	6336620	Oh, shit, I'm so sorry.
6336620	6339620	I just want to help your child.
6339620	6341620	I take it back.
6341620	6342620	I take it back.
6342620	6345620	Now I want to go over to the kid.
6345620	6349620	I think diplomacy has gone out the window a long time ago.
6349620	6351620	Wait, wait, just, just, just.
6351620	6353620	We've got zero hearts.
6353620	6354620	Give me a second.
6354620	6356620	I take out my water skin.
6356620	6360620	I try to give the kid some water and some trail rations.
6360620	6362620	All right, well, the kid's unconscious.
6362620	6363620	I just lost the heart.
6363620	6364620	I made my broken nose bleed.
6364620	6365620	Oh, no.
6365620	6366620	Do you need anything?
6366620	6368620	Oh, no.
6368620	6369620	Oh.
6370620	6371620	Yeah.
6372620	6374620	Do I get his turn?
6374620	6376620	Yeah, you get his turn.
6381620	6383620	He's got, he's, he's.
6383620	6386620	Someone get that man a tissue.
6386620	6387620	Hollywood.
6387620	6388620	Hollywood.
6388620	6389620	Hollywood.
6389620	6390620	Hollywood.
6394620	6397620	How amazing would it have been when you got in a fight with that guy
6397620	6402620	at the mid cave concert if he had you cornered and he had a couple of guys
6402620	6408620	and then all of a sudden, like, all of your friends from jail, the Latino,
6408620	6410620	like, Hollywood guys.
6411620	6412620	I appreciate it.
6412620	6413620	You having a problem, Hollywood?
6413620	6417620	And then you look and it's just, like, nine dudes and they, like, swing like
6417620	6419620	pirates into the fray.
6423620	6425620	All right, continue.
6426620	6434620	I just, I know this is like, oh, oh, Dan, just same old Dan.
6434620	6436620	He doesn't know how to play Pathfinder.
6436620	6439620	But I could have sworn, like, I'm a cleric.
6439620	6440620	Oh, yeah.
6440620	6441620	I'm level two.
6441620	6445620	There's an evil beastie here in front of me in the form of this, like, black silhouette
6445620	6446620	ghost.
6446620	6452620	Like, I got, and I don't, I just, I don't have any, like, standard, like, just in AD&D
6452620	6455620	in the 80s, it was just, I'm a cleric called Turn Undead.
6455620	6456620	It's just a skill I have.
6456620	6459620	Like, I don't have anything like that, right?
6459620	6461620	Yeah, you'll get that next level, I believe.
6461620	6462620	Well, I can't wait.
6464620	6467620	But for now, I guess I just go, like, go, white ghost!
6470620	6471620	You do that.
6472620	6473620	The white ghost is going.
6474620	6476620	Well, I guess it's a white ghost.
6476620	6478620	The ghost, it's a ghost of color.
6479620	6482620	Maybe it's the ghost of, of, of white Rhone.
6482620	6483620	Yeah.
6483620	6487620	Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe the whole thing that happened here is we forgot Rhone's Rust Belt.
6491620	6492620	Could be.
6493620	6494620	All right.
6494620	6496620	You root for the kid.
6496620	6497620	Go, Archer, go!
6497620	6498620	We believe in you!
6498620	6499620	Come on!
6500620	6501620	You believe in Archer.
6503620	6504620	All right.
6504620	6505620	All right.
6508620	6509620	Someone else do something.
6509620	6510620	Okay.
6511620	6512620	Chad, I believe.
6512620	6515620	Are they in physical form or in ghostly kind of apparition form?
6516620	6517620	Oh!
6517620	6518620	You don't know.
6518620	6519620	Wait a minute.
6519620	6520620	It's hard to tell.
6520620	6522620	By looking at it, they just look, they look ghostly.
6522620	6523620	I mean.
6523620	6528620	Channel Smite is a feat, which I hope does not fail me now.
6529620	6533620	Use channel energy to deal extra damage to undead on attack.
6533620	6537620	So basically, like, if I could just do a standard attack, I mean, might as well do something.
6537620	6541620	Attack the, clearly the more evil of the two ghosts.
6541620	6542620	I know who Archer is.
6542620	6544620	I don't want to attack Archer.
6544620	6545620	What do you attack with?
6545620	6550620	I am, of course, going to use my Morningstar.
6550620	6551620	All right.
6551620	6553620	What's the attack bonus on that?
6553620	6554620	Plus two.
6556620	6557620	It hits!
6558620	6560620	And I'm using that Channel Smite.
6560620	6563620	So I'm going, like, in the name of Horroff.
6567620	6569620	I can't find my dice.
6571620	6572620	The whole bag of dice.
6576620	6578620	Dealing 10 damage.
6579620	6585620	Your Morningstar phases through the incorporeal body of the demon spirit, but you can see
6585620	6589620	the white energy of the silver flame that emanates from your weapon.
6589620	6595620	Disperse the form of the demon creature as it slices through its mistly body.
6602620	6605620	You get the sense that the ghost kid did most of the work.
6606620	6610620	But you don't let that bother you because a win's a win.
6612620	6613620	I think you did it.
6613620	6614620	He did do it.
6615620	6619620	And hey, nice bullseye on that housewife.
6624620	6626620	She cut my ankles.
6626620	6627620	I was scared.
6627620	6628620	She was the worst.
6628620	6629620	I didn't know.
6629620	6631620	She's still under the bed, you guys.
6631620	6632620	You can hear us.
6632620	6633620	She's got to know.
6633620	6635620	He dragged her out after he hit her with a rock.
6635620	6637620	We're the 18th.
6637620	6643620	I mean, but results are results.
6643620	6645620	I don't want to be Machiavellian about it.
6645620	6647620	I turn to Tom and I go, come on.
6647620	6650620	Yeah, we got that house no longer on fire.
6650620	6652620	Kid no longer haunted.
6652620	6654620	I'm talking about a good church.
6656620	6657620	He passes out.
6658620	6662620	What's happening with the with Archer, the ghost of Archer, the good spirit?
6662620	6668620	The ghost kid looks at you like in a in a regarding way.
6668620	6671620	It's like, wow, people, huh?
6672620	6673620	Archer.
6673620	6674620	Yeah.
6674620	6675620	What's going on in this town?
6675620	6681620	Archer doesn't really talk, but it kind of walks backwards and phases out of the wall.
6681620	6684620	And you can kind of see it outside the window.
6685620	6686620	Oh, oh, oh.
6686620	6688620	He wants his diarrhea.
6688620	6689620	Follow the ghost.
6689620	6691620	I follow Archer.
6692620	6701620	Archer's going towards the graveyard at the end of the city, at the edge of the forest.
6701620	6706620	But would our heroes find a thing in the end of the D&D?
6709620	6710620	All right.
6710620	6711620	Yeah.
6711620	6712620	Do you want to wrap or something?
6712620	6713620	Yeah.
6713620	6714620	Yeah.
6714620	6716620	We did it.
6717620	6718620	Zach.
6718620	6720620	Zach, you got a beat?
6720620	6722620	Lay it on us, Zach.
6722620	6725620	Zach McKeever back there, the DJ with the mostest.
6729620	6730620	All right.
6732620	6733620	Oh, yeah.
6737620	6738620	Yo.
6740620	6743620	Higher and higher.
6744620	6745620	Wrap.
6746620	6747620	Hip.
6747620	6748620	Hop.
6748620	6749620	Wrap.
6749620	6750620	Wrap.
6752620	6756620	I'm getting higher and higher.
6756620	6762620	I went out to the sun, said to the moon, I'm going to combine you both real soon because
6762620	6764620	I'm an alchemist.
6764620	6769620	I combine things and make children sing.
6769620	6774620	So I took some gold and some silver, put them in a bowl.
6775620	6781620	And I waited, but nothing happened.
6781620	6785620	I'm a bad alchemist.
6785620	6789620	Got a lot to learn about alchemy.
6789620	6793620	Can't just put two medals in a bowl.
6793620	6794620	They won't do anything.
6794620	6797620	If they did, alchemy wouldn't be called alchemy.
6797620	6801620	It would be called what normally happens.
6802620	6805620	But this is how we learn.
6805620	6817620	So I went to burn some books about alchemy because I was still not thinking right about
6817620	6823620	how it works and thought if I could make alchemy have less information that relatively I would
6823620	6825620	be more of an alchemist.
6826620	6831620	It was misguided thinking.
6831620	6833620	It was stinking thinking.
6833620	6835620	It wasn't like Lincoln.
6835620	6849620	He freed the slaves and created graves that are haunted by white America today.
6849620	6852620	We struggle with integrity.
6856620	6861620	We played G&G and we did it pretty nicely.
6861620	6863620	I'm real proud of myself.
6863620	6866620	When you say self, you're probably going to rhyme it with shelf.
6866620	6870620	There's almost no other word that you're going to come up with.
6870620	6881620	Mouth, south, yo, I'm going to take a tooth, put it in a booth, and it's going to shoot Lincoln.
6882620	6887620	That's a homonym, right?
6887620	6890620	Yo, a minty homonym.
6890620	6893620	I heard my name, I'm coming in again.
6893620	6898620	I sound like other things, and when I ring a ling, I suck my jingle ling.
6898620	6904620	I got a Roger Waters-sized dick.
6904620	6915620	I can suck on it just by bringing it to my lips, the hip, the hop, the hip, hip, the hip.
6915620	6918620	Can you do a Roger Waters sample about his dick?
6918620	6922620	Can you do a Pink Floyd mix on that?
6923620	6939620	The razor blade, the cold cut of British government, issues you don't understand when you're 15, but they sound cool.
6939620	6948620	I'm Roger Waters, the government of England in the 70s, who is confusing to you,
6948620	6953620	but the general idea is disenfranchisement.
6953620	6958620	My name is John Johnson.
6964620	6970620	This rap has been hit and miss, but it's like a river of piss.
6970620	6975620	Maybe it's made of piss, but it's still a river.
6975620	6983620	You could try to fish in it, and if you catch a fish, it's still a fish even though it lives in piss,
6983620	6990620	and you take it home, and you cook it up, and you eat it up, and then you get seven up to wash it down,
6990620	6993620	but then you got diabetes.
6993620	6998620	Thank you for coming to Harvard Town, everybody.
6998620	7000620	I think we did it.
