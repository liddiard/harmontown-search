0	7800	Ladies and gentlemen, this is Harman Town. It is now in session. Please welcome to the
7800	22960	stage, Spencer Crittenden. The mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman. I will be guest come to
22960	27400	the stage for the lovely, lovely Jeff Davis. I am Brandon Johnson. God bless you.
27400	36400	Thank you, Brandon. How are you? I'm a little drunk already. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, we
36400	43520	got a late start, so we're just up there boozing it up. Sorry, we'll start on time at some
43520	50720	point in the future. And if we don't, then we're just late, starting on time. I like
50720	59840	that. Yeah. I have really bad heartburn because I just went off of Prilosec because I went
59840	66640	to the doctor and he said, how are you feeling? I went to go in for my little checkup, you
66640	73200	know, check the liver, check everything. Just the liver. Well, mostly the liver. I'm going
73200	79720	for the liver. Yeah. Well, whatever. I know I'm going to get some kind of cirrhosis or
79720	84760	whatever or something. And then people are going to be like, I just hate that. I'm allowed
84760	95000	to drink and then die without it being like, I told you so. It's just like, fuck you. What
95000	102480	if I drink my whole life and then it's my liver that kills me? It's like, see? I just
102480	107740	hate that. I hate how we deal with death. We act like it's a disease, but even worse
107740	111900	than that, like that it strikes only those that did something to deserve it. Like you're
111900	117420	all going to die. You fucking pieces of shit. And by the way, I've said it before, I'll
117420	125700	say it again. I'll believe any shit that you say about medicine the day anyone generates
125700	132140	a society where the doctors live on average a day longer than the other people. There's
132140	140620	no fucking doctors don't live any longer. They know everything and they die randomly
140620	152580	because God made us to kill us. That's our relationship or we created God to kill us.
152580	159100	Keeping things fancy for Brandon, a little more collegiate for the kids. But anyway,
159100	163900	I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking long enough to have Alzheimer's for sure.
163900	169500	Because if you do die, you don't want to die with heartburn. Yeah. And also, but then they
169500	174900	linked Prilosec to Alzheimer's now, like last year. So the doctor says, oh, how you feeling?
174900	180540	He says at the end of the whole thing, he says, is there anything you're worried about?
180540	190020	First of all, you told me, motherfucker, your job. Like, how fucking fake is this shit?
190020	194740	It's like a tarot card reader being like, just think about what's on your mind and also
194740	202540	tell me real quick, my job. Well, then that's what that means. He goes like, are you worried
202540	205700	about anything? And I'm like, no, no, I'm fine. And I'm like, well, wait, well, you
205700	212340	know, I've been taking Prilosec for like a fucking ever. And should I be doing that?
212340	217740	They told me keep taking it because I was fine. And he's like, uh, I'm like, because
217740	222620	I heard it was linked to Alzheimer's. And he's like, yeah, here's the thing. I want
222620	231220	you to get off the Prilosec because it causes Alzheimer's. Like he acted like I said nothing.
231220	238140	He just pretended that it was his idea. I was like, what the fuck?
238140	240660	Maybe he heard your impression of him.
240660	250460	Oh, whatever, man. Is it, is it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant? Is it? Yes. Well,
250460	255380	I don't mean to ask you a question and then disagree with you, but I think the answer
255380	260860	is a case by case basis. I think if you can tell it's going to be audible, like the what's
260860	270580	in there, I think if, uh, uh, I think no one should ever sneeze. I think if I hold
270580	277840	in my sneezes, I'd say like 95% of the time. And I'd say it's the right thing to do.
277840	282340	I certainly wish to rip off a thought from, uh, you know, Karen and Georgia and my favorite
282340	287540	murder. They were talking about a shout sneezers scream when they, when they, people that just
287540	293660	like stop doing that. That's a choice. That's a choice. Another thing you could do is you
293660	302500	could turn a sneeze into a yell where you go. Yeah. But I'll, I'll tell you this, man,
302500	307300	nothing is more nerve wracking than people. No, I mean, I, the people, when they go like,
307300	314580	you know, and you're like, God, Jesus Christ, you're killing yourself. Yeah. I don't want
314580	319420	anybody doing that. Yeah. Don't, don't do that for me. Like, Oh, I'm doing it. But that's
319420	326340	part of why you do it because that's what exactly it, that's what, that's the, the stigma.
326340	330140	Like you're going to get a stroke or something. Wouldn't that be amazing if someone was like,
330140	337620	and they just like topple over and their eye turns red. It would be amazing. He was so
337620	346340	polite and then his head exploded. It killed him. He was a doctor, but he died at 50 because
346340	353260	he was a polite doctor. Uh, well, uh, yeah. Well, I don't think I had anything else to
353260	356620	say except that I just, I, look, I blew my nose in a restaurant at a house of pies today
356620	361780	and I was like, first of all, it's a house of pies. So the bar is lowered and uh, but
361780	365500	then I blew it and I was like, I bet nobody wanted to hear that. Like, like, because it's
365500	370620	one thing, there's a, there's a nose blow where it just sounds like there's a, you know,
370620	375740	you're just blowing your nose and then there's nose blows. That's like, Oh, two things just
375740	380900	came out. I don't know if that should hear like a thump, thump, you know, no one wants
380900	385580	to hear fully work. Like when you're blowing, I don't know, if you could, if it's one sound
385580	390540	effect of guy blowing his nose on the sound effect record, fine. If it's two sound effects
390540	396500	of like, you know, grape coming out of a garden hose or something, you know, like it's
396500	402780	still a record in your mind. It's still a sound effect record, which I love when I was
402780	409180	a kid, they had record albums at the library and uh, I used to always rent the, I would,
409180	413260	I begged my mom, like, can I get this? And she's like, again, it was sound effects record.
413260	418180	I would get, I would get sound effects records and I would just sit and listen to him like
418180	425940	a fucking asshole. The shit paid off. Just like, like, like, like, like spooky sound
425940	429420	effect. I was really into like the occult of stuff. So there was like, but all year round
429420	434500	I would rent Halloween sound effects records and it would just be like the same shit on
434500	438700	every record. Cause they would just be recycled or licensed. There was just like some guy
438700	446220	going on a piano and then like window shutters and then a cat going and I would just sit
446220	455780	there and fucking stim and listen to it. I've got to be autistic, right? Like I just like
455780	459980	figured out how to start covering it up at like nine or something. So you can't diagnose
459980	465300	me now cause I'm like Ben Affleck in the accountant. I'm like hiding it. No, he's not hiding it.
465300	471140	He's like, he's like stoked about it. You got to see Ben Affleck in the accountant.
471140	477380	That's amazing. Uh, it's so incredible. He's a, he's a, he's an autistic superhero because
477380	485500	his dad, his dad was an army man that didn't cotton to autism acceptance and so trained
485500	490700	him to his, his dad figured, well, if he doesn't like bright lights and loud sounds, then he
490700	496500	should be exposed to more of them and he should learn to kill. And, and, and, and, and instead
496500	500120	of that guy being the villain, that guy is like the OB one. That's the, he's the reason
500120	505080	why instead of just a regular autistic, Ben Affleck is an amazing crime fighter because
505080	511920	he's part autistic part functional soldier. The combination is amazing. He can, he can,
511920	518240	he can artistically aim his sniper rifle. It's so fucked up. Like he can calculate how
518240	524400	to kill you. And it's, it's really, it's really silly and amazing. It's really that and Lucy,
524400	528680	like you want to watch these movies, all bad movies should be as good as that. Lucy's that's
528680	531200	the one where she's using a hundred percent of her brain so she can just start making
531200	535640	people float and stuff, right? Is that the one I'm thinking of? I did not see Lucy and
535640	539800	Morgan Freeman just keeps narrating the whole movie at 70% of your brain. You can make shit
539800	544040	float and then she just does it. There's no conflict on the whole movie. She just like,
544040	548200	then the first 10 minutes there's conflict because she hasn't yet ingested this superhero
548200	551600	amount of drugs. And then she becomes a superhero and the rest of the movie is just her fucking
551600	556280	like making the city lay down or making a building dance. And then Morgan Freeman is
556280	560920	explaining in VO why that's possible and then she just turns into a computer and flies
560920	568960	into the moon or something. But it's great. It's a great movie. All right. Let's bring
568960	590240	up, uh, let's bring up Rob's shrub and cordry. The Rob's are gesturing to each other to go
590240	603880	through the stairs. They went up together at the same time. I'm narrating. We came up
603880	610320	together at the same time. You know, this is a great live show and a better live stream,
610320	621360	but it's also an audio podcast. Yep. So those listeners at home, we did a fantastic bet
621360	628440	and I narrate it. Even though no one laughed at it, it was, it was funny in a very subtle
628440	634320	way. I, I really liked it. I really liked what we did. I thought it was, it was really
634320	640800	good. It was great. It was really good. Daniel, we were on the same page. Hello. Come on,
640800	652600	Harmon. Don't fuck this up. Um, hi, Dan. Hi. Happy Sunday. The thing's not coming up. That's
652600	663680	asking me if I want a mirror. Why is the mannequin hid behind, uh, the doll house? Why is it
663840	677520	nice? You thought I was the mannequin. That's a compliment. That's a sexy mannequin. You think
677520	683880	I'm that thin? Oh, I bet I know what it is. Oh, you could see is the dome. All right. Okay.
683880	691120	All right. And you saw fishnets. Got it. Okay. You like, you ready, Dan? We've been stalling.
691120	696400	Yeah. So yeah, I don't know if, you know, I probably won't do this every, uh, you know,
696400	700720	I don't know if I'll do it every week. I'm experimenting with her. I didn't make you wait
700720	709040	for any, is it shut up. I got, I got two, I got two Rob's up here. You know, that's a good,
709040	713320	there's a fucking point to that. If either of you steps out of line, it's like, look to your left.
713960	719880	It's a problem. Oh shit. And I'm someone, and I'm someone's dad.
720680	725240	So I got, you know, I got, I got, I got like, uh, topics tonight.
728840	732760	Is this like, it's like a slide. This is my, this is my mind map.
732760	737160	I got entertainment, politics, psychology, art, science, and culture.
737160	742680	Brandon's face is on cold water. Thank you, Brandon, for posing for,
744520	747480	for those of you that they're just laughing at the fact that I've got a,
747480	753400	quite a visual, I've got a mind map set up here, but, but the, uh, but the, but the, but the,
753400	758520	but the podcast is still going to be very audio friendly. Like, so I, and I, and I don't know that
758520	766120	I'll have all Sunday to like, you know, I talked about heartburn. I didn't talk about Ruby Ridge.
766120	770760	I saw a documentary about Ruby Ridge. Uh, do you know anything about that? You ever hear of
770760	777480	Ruby? No, I don't either. It was like the prequel to Waco that makes you go like, well,
777480	781000	why did Waco happen? Why, like, why didn't they learn anything? Cause it was just like the
781000	786200	government was just like, Oh, first they entrapped a guy. Like they were worried because there were
786200	791080	Nazis in the woods. Uh, like, like there are people out there, but it's like now I think you,
791080	797240	you watch that and go like, God, the glory days, the fucking, remember when the Nazis were in the
797240	803800	woods, just running around being Nazis and having like a little, little serious burning things and
803800	811480	like dancing and going like, we ought to be in the city. And like, I'd love to seek higher
811480	815480	with more people. Well, you can't, you gotta stay in the woods.
815480	824120	Jethro Hitler. Uh, but you know, cause now they're in the White House that it's worse,
824120	828520	isn't it? That's worse when they're in the White House. It's pretty bad. I always go,
828520	835560	when I go back to, I, I grew up in New England, whenever I go back there, um, there's bunkers
835560	842920	everywhere, like old cement bunkers from World War II. And it always seems so cute. It's like
843000	848040	adorable. Like, oh, look, they thought people were going to attack from the sea.
849800	854920	Now it's going to be electronically, you fucking dummies.
857240	860040	Pepe, the frog will be the submarine that
862680	864600	can hack your Amazon account.
867400	871960	Don't you feel bad for the eyes of DVDs? All right. Well, look,
873000	878600	so yeah, whatever. I mean, they, so there was this guy that was running around with the Nazis too,
878600	882840	but he was really just like, he was like a farmer and like in the seventies, like far as far, we
882840	888120	really, the farmers got really fucked. And, um, and this guy was kind of like, uh, you know, he
888120	892440	didn't, he wasn't, wasn't a big fan of the federal government and he, he, he liked his farm and life
892440	896120	and he moved out to the middle of nowhere and there were Nazis out there and he kind of made
896120	903240	friends with them. And, uh, uh, because their cups of sugar were still sweet.
906040	912200	They just happened to be Nazis. Uh, and, uh, and, uh, there was, and because there were Nazis there,
912200	916360	there were like feds that were like infiltrating and always trying to like, you know, figure out
916360	921480	how do we bust these guys? They make us nervous. And, uh, and so they told this guy, they, they,
921480	924520	it was entrapment. Like they said like, Hey, do you think he could saw off some
924600	928600	shotguns for us? And he's like, okay, I have a saw. And then they're like, you're under arrest. And
928600	937160	he's like, God damn it. No, no, this is cause I'm a Nazi, right? This is my friends are Nazis.
937160	940600	And so he didn't, he didn't want to go to jail. So they, and then they're like, well, now what
940600	945960	are we going to do? He's surrounded by Nazis and has a bunch of sawed off shortcuts. You didn't
945960	953080	take the shotguns with you. Uh, um, and, and so then, and then it just went to fucking shit
953080	958920	because the government was trying to figure out how do you walk in and go and like, they're just,
958920	963720	there's kids and there's guns. And so they were like creeping around the property all the time
963720	968040	for months, trying to figure out what to do. And maybe we'll set up a couple more cameras and just
968040	972920	watch them a little bit more. And after a while, we'll figure out an easy way to do this. And then
972920	976760	one time they were creeping around the property and the dog started barking. And then like, um,
976760	981720	like five minutes later, no, no one knows what really happened. Everyone's accusing everyone
981720	989240	else of being villains, but, but like the dog was dead. A kid was dead. Um, and everyone was
989240	993560	freaking the fuck out and there was a big standoff. And then they, and then the fucking like they
993560	998120	brought it, they were just had like snipers that were just watching the house. And then like the
998120	1003880	wife walked out and they just fucking killed her. And like, and then the, but the feds didn't know
1003880	1008440	that the wife was dead. So they kept trying to use her to like, get the guy to surrender and go like,
1008440	1014040	come on, do it for Margaret. He's like, what the hell are you talking about? She's laying on the
1014040	1018280	kitchen floor. And they're like, we can't hear you. You don't have a loudspeaker. Margaret loves
1018280	1025000	muffins. Come on. And he thought they were just fucking with him. Like, like, like, because how
1025000	1033400	do you kill someone and not know? Um, and the answer is government. Uh, anyways, Ruby Ridge,
1033400	1040520	check it out. Google it. It's fun. Uh, is it rude to blow your nose in a restaurant? I guess
1040520	1046200	the, what I'm hearing is no. Oh, you had something. I had something you had something to say. Uh,
1046200	1053880	check it out. I think it is if you have cloth napkins, if, if you're in a nice,
1053880	1060280	nicer restaurant that has taken the time to give you cloth napkins, but I still do it.
1061000	1066840	I'll still blow my nose in those things. Yeah. I've never done that. That feels like, yeah,
1066840	1073960	I know. I don't feel good about it, but I'll do it. I'll definitely do it. I found out I'm not
1073960	1083800	sexist because I was, I was at a rap party for a show that I will control from above. Uh, and, uh,
1083800	1092040	I, I, one of the writers who's a lady writer, a righteous, um, she, who I respect as a human
1092040	1098440	being, I gave her a job on a show and her partner, by the way, wrote the show while writing a human
1098440	1105880	being in her belly because, because if she needed maternity, she wouldn't get it. But, uh, the, the,
1105960	1112760	but so one of the writer, right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
1112760	1119960	She, she brought her husband who I've met a thousand times and my girlfriend, Cody,
1119960	1124760	who's also a righteous, by the way, um, she met the husband. She started talking. She's like,
1124760	1129480	well, what do you do? And I was like, what does he do? He's married to a writer. That's what he does.
1129480	1135320	Um, and then his job turned out really interesting. It was like, he, he like designs like video games
1135320	1138840	and stuff. And he particularly is designing stuff that has to do with like helping people's
1138840	1143000	neurology that have PTSD and all this stuff. All this interesting stuff that I didn't know
1143000	1146440	because I never saw him as a human being because I'm not sexist
1148600	1151240	because I respect writers, not men.
1151240	1161080	And I hate spouses, not women. I'm fucking awesome. Thank you.
1163640	1167960	Well, why don't we check in with the entertainment section here?
1170200	1172760	Got a lot of, see, I'm so excited. It's like a real show.
1174120	1178280	You guys heard about Piers Morgan today, right? Like he, uh, what happened? It turned out,
1178280	1183560	he, uh, he doesn't know. Oh yeah. Yeah. I did. I did read it. Somebody, he was talking about,
1184600	1189720	he was talking about men, men, this and men, that men should suck it up and then suck it up. And
1189720	1195720	then, and then men should suck it up. I'm going to get that tattooed on my fucking balls. Uh,
1195720	1200360	the, the, uh, and he was like, Oh, men, this and men, that. And then men were tweeting at him and
1200360	1205080	going like, well, fuck you. Why don't you grow up? Like real men did know how they feel and talk
1205080	1209960	about their feelings. And then he responded to one of them is James Bond, not a real man then.
1211720	1216680	And the real entertaining thing was like, then for the rest of the day, he, it was like, you
1216680	1220920	knew something was up. Cause it was like, wait, he doesn't know. But then he clearly, he was like,
1220920	1226200	Oh yeah, I didn't know that. Yeah. Thanks a lot. I didn't know that. But he responded to every
1226200	1229800	tweet. And it just kept like, yeah, I didn't know. Thanks for telling me what James Bond
1229800	1236040	is a real. I thought he was real. It was like, you did, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. You, you, you,
1236040	1240760	you tweeted 50 times about this. You thought James Bond was real and you're British. We're,
1240760	1245720	we're allowed to think he's real. Does he not hang out with GI Joe?
1250280	1254440	So anyways, way to go. You fucking ball sack. I hate Pierce Morgan. I guess you're supposed
1254440	1258120	to hate him. And that's bread and services. What is this? Adam ultra-burg tag? You know,
1258120	1265240	you're just playing into his trap. Yeah. That's Adam, Adam, Adam Goldberg figuring out how he's
1266120	1271960	he just keeps tagging tweets. Cause he realized that that'll make a dropdown happen. That's so,
1271960	1279400	that's so fucked up. Well, I've got some, now don't freak out when I say video finds,
1279400	1282440	because you're listening at home and you're chopping your carrots and you're poor and you
1282440	1287720	don't pay for the podcast is going to be terrible for you. No, it's not. I promise. Oh,
1288280	1292920	so like for instance, well, so, okay. So my girlfriend, Cody Heller,
1292920	1297640	like she, she does what a lot of people does do. No, does, does.
1299400	1304120	She, uh, at one point she started following everyone named Cody Heller on Facebook and stuff.
1304120	1309400	Like I do that. I have, I have, I have a couple of Dan Harmon friends. Yeah. No, every,
1309400	1313400	everyone should do that. I think it's fun. I want to find out what you look like if your
1313400	1320040	parents had actually fed you vegetables. Yeah. I also follow a guy that's like the better version
1320040	1323400	of you. Cause if there's like, like I look, there's a better Brandon Johnson out there.
1323400	1327640	Like he's fucking successful and he's handsome and I'm like, I'll kill this dude.
1329640	1337000	I follow a guy whose first name is Cordry. Really? Yeah. Because his parents were a fan
1337000	1345320	of my like distant cousins who was a journalist for the Washington post back in the sixties.
1346120	1353160	And he asked Ronald Reagan a question once in the eighties and they were like, yes, he,
1354280	1361160	he then, and they named him Cordry. His first name is Cordry. So shout out.
1361560	1365960	I follow one of the guys I follow on Twitter is Dan Garmin.
1368360	1370600	And so when things are real bad, like after the election,
1370600	1373480	I'll just check in with him and go, what's going on in your universe?
1377320	1380040	You're treating it like you're parallel. Donald grump get elected.
1385480	1389480	But he's always like, no, it's the same here. My name's just different than yours.
1390120	1392040	Your fame doesn't make me an object.
1394520	1399320	But anyways, Cody, Cody, Cody follows a bunch of Cody Hellers who are all dudes.
1399320	1403400	Basically, Cody's more, I guess, skews more of a dude name.
1405240	1410200	And but so it's just that the only reason that's important is that all this is,
1410200	1413640	is just a random video from YouTube. And if you're listening, you'll hear the audio.
1413640	1418120	There is no, the video is simply will tell you what the video is, but the audio is where it's at.
1418120	1422040	Speaking of hearing the audio, we're going to need to plug in that headphone jack.
1422040	1425080	Good call. Good call, brother.
1425080	1430040	Do you follow any Spencer's or do you know, I think it's a really weird thing to do.
1431480	1434120	Maybe it's because I have a weird name, but yeah.
1435480	1441000	Are there dicks in this? No. Okay. Just asking.
1441560	1450360	I think I think I think that's a reasonable question context. Yeah.
1450360	1454200	Yeah. I mean, you made it a point to say that Cody's are usually men.
1454840	1460280	Oh yeah. Well, but I mean, there's a it takes place in a karate dojo.
1460280	1462760	This video, so I guess you could say there's like 50 dicks, but
1464680	1470200	but so it's just this video that's posted of this guy, Cody Heller's YouTube page.
1470760	1477240	I guess what it is, is him like except I think it's Cody Heller who I think is maybe a Russian
1477240	1481080	guy or a Polish guy, I don't know, or maybe it's just his karate instructor whose voice you'll
1481080	1486040	hear in a second is Russian or something. He's speaking English, but with this like
1486040	1493240	Eastern European accent and he he's going to give Cody Heller, this young man, his purple belt
1494360	1499240	in whatever martial art there this is. And the guy, the guy is so this has nothing to do with
1499240	1503000	my girlfriend or her name. It's just like, that's how we found this random video. And I was just like,
1503000	1508200	so entranced by this. I wanted to share it with people because I'm so confused about this guy
1508200	1514600	and his like, I don't his attitude about giving someone a purple belt and also what you'll do.
1514600	1520920	Yeah. So just listen to this guy over here training really hard.
1522200	1526280	Yeah. I mean, really broad to make this level right now.
1526280	1529880	Wow. His name is Corey. Come in here.
1553880	1554840	Where is the camera?
1557080	1565160	It's like a casting board to say it. Yeah. So part of the visual is that this guy,
1565160	1572040	the karate instructor, I guess has a GoPro, maybe like in between my row, Corey.
1574280	1578040	I don't think he's being surreptitious. I think he just doesn't, he just wanted to,
1578040	1581800	he just doesn't have a harness or he just, oh, I got a harness.
1581800	1589160	I have a saddle and a whip Corey. But the one video, so really all you're
1589160	1593160	seeing is the inside of a guy's coat. And you're just, so if you're chopping carrots and listening
1593160	1597640	to this, you're not missing anything, but except, except this one thing, he's about to tie the
1597640	1606840	purple belt around Cody. And, and you're, and I don't, does this guy, is he, this guy is either
1606840	1613640	not the instructor or, or, or is so focused on the martial arts. He's never actually tied
1613640	1625320	a belt before. Like he starts to put it on. Okay. You've done enough, by the way, belt
1625320	1630440	wise, as far as I'm concerned, but now he keeps going. You can't hold them better. You can't hold
1634440	1637640	stuff to the belt. Yeah, that's just a,
1639800	1643560	I think he hands it off to a guy who just like ties it like a karate belt. And then they hug.
1646360	1648920	I just want to listen to him again. Come in here.
1655320	1673080	It just sounds like he's up to something. Is that like a, is that an, is that an Eastern
1673080	1677480	European stereotype? Is that like, is like, if you have an Arkansas accent, people like do we,
1677480	1681560	it's bad. We're closed-minded. We think you're dumb because you talk like this, but, but like,
1681720	1684760	like, and then is it like, if you sound like Eastern European, you sound like you're going
1684760	1687720	to like fucking murder someone. That's like that guy's from the Alabama.
1692920	1695320	Yeah. No, we got your guns in the car.
1698600	1703720	We never cut your head and hands off. So the fingerprints and teeth can be identified.
1703720	1715640	I'm Greek, not Serbian. All right. And I just wanted to share that. I found this on my YouTube
1715640	1719080	channel and I don't know if I ever shared this with anybody. This is from forensic files. Again,
1719080	1723960	if you're listening, just listen, you know, there's nothing visual. You have to have a voice in the
1723960	1739000	kills instantly. According to forensic pathologist, Dr. John, Dr. John, but don't get any simpler than
1739000	1745160	that. What, what, what forensic files were they, were they trying to get underneath?
1745160	1748760	I don't think it was Frederick files, but it was, that was, that was, uh, what's his name? The guy
1748760	1755640	poor man's forensic file. What was his name? The guy, the, the guy that rescued and, uh,
1755640	1760200	and then here's the only other, is the only other video clip. And again, totally audio friendly
1760200	1763640	for those of you fucking assholes that just listen for free and complain.
1765000	1769000	This is from the movie, which one was a Pierce Brosnan and volcano or Dante's peak?
1771560	1777400	So like, I don't know either do or don't name your characters Harry and Terry. If you're in
1777480	1779400	an action film.
1779400	1805720	Yeah, all right. That's the, I saved the worst for last. I understand. But, uh, yeah,
1806520	1815000	Harry, Terry, Terry, can you hear me? Terry, Terry, where are you? Terry, wait, I'm Harry.
1816440	1826520	Terrence, Terrence Harrison, Harrison, Terrence Harrison, Harold, what is your full name
1826520	1832520	that you shortened to Harry? Let's go to one thought provoking Twitter question.
1833480	1838840	I'm so stoked about my technology. Oh, this fucking not Dan Harmon guy keeps responding
1838840	1845240	to everything. All right. How do you feel about LA versus New York and the impassioned back and
1845240	1852280	forth between us? Is there, what is that? What does that mean? Is there rap? Do you mean like
1852280	1858760	with rap? No, I think just hip hop. I think just with the city's east coast is better than
1858760	1864840	west coast. All right. That's not a good question. Yeah. No, that wasn't a statement. That was a
1864840	1870680	question. We don't get it. We don't get it. Uh, I, I think I got the clear to tell this story about,
1870680	1879240	about Cody. I thought this was funny. Uh, we do a lot of, uh, role playing. Oh yeah. Like pathfinder.
1880280	1886120	Yeah. Second edition. Yeah. Uh, you know, and it gets pretty
1886120	1895080	violent, sexual, creatives, heavy, let's say taboo, beautiful. You're both writers. So it gets
1895080	1899000	pretty good. You lose yourself to some dark forbidden places. You kind of lose yourself
1899000	1906200	in order to verify for our own animal brains, that sex is happening. Got it. Uh, there's visuals
1906200	1911480	to this. No, no, I just want to, I just wanted to tell this story. Cause I, cause I, cause I,
1912440	1919000	cause I love my girlfriend so much and I, and I, so I just, this really just made me really love her
1919000	1923960	extra more. Uh, okay. Yeah. Share with us. Right.
1925000	1930760	Share with us pal. We were, we were, we were doing like a thing. So a scene
1931480	1937960	and a sexually and, uh, and the, the, the construction of the scene had to do with the taboo,
1938600	1945160	uh, age dynamic and, uh, and, uh, she was way older than you. Yeah.
1947160	1951720	Was it, it was young doctor and really, I needed a college credit and,
1954680	1960680	Daniel, come on over. My rocket chair don't work so good anymore.
1960680	1969080	It's centered on a lack of experience on her part. And, uh, I've never had sex before.
1976840	1982760	I could go with any second time in my nineties. Could you please help a poor old lady out?
1982760	1988360	Oh, could you help a poor old lady out? And she's so hard right now.
1990440	1996280	And she's fading out in her life. Could you help me? Let me put my teeth in.
1998200	2004840	Um, it was, it was, uh, I look, I'm not proud of, you know, that's why it's the bedroom and not the
2004840	2009560	boardroom. I, uh, although we've done that, we've done that too. We talked about the boardroom,
2009560	2015960	but, but I, but I note to self, stay away from the starburns, uh, no, no, no.
2015960	2021160	Conference room table. No, no, stop it. The, uh,
2022840	2030600	I haven't my sandwich on the table here. During the, uh, during the, during the taboo fantasy,
2030600	2039240	I was like, well, if you ever done this before and she was like, uh, well, a couple of times
2039560	2044680	I mean, four or five. And I was like, okay. And then I had more questions. I'm like, with whom?
2044680	2050760	And then, and then we went into, and it was a kind of a circuitous path to, to, to then,
2050760	2057560	you know, just like the board room. Yeah. And then afterwards, you know, we like to, uh,
2058440	2063800	review, give notes, give notes. It's not less, less notes, more accolades,
2063800	2074680	I think like awards ceremonies. Uh, when you said, uh, this was really good. I don't feel like
2074680	2078760	your arc really, we've done that. It was really good. That was really good. Thank you for giving
2078760	2082920	me a Latin surname. There's not enough diversity in these scenarios. I really appreciate it.
2082920	2088040	I was very proactive of you. Um, yeah, we give each other a little little props and high fives.
2088040	2093160	And I, and I was like, why, why, what happened with the, with the little loop of conversation?
2093160	2099240	Why was, why, why was it so important that the number of times that she had done this or that
2099240	2103800	and you went into all this detail and then I had questions and she's like, oh yeah, I just got,
2103800	2109880	I had an internal logic bump there. Like, cause, uh, you know, I just felt like I, you know,
2109880	2115400	the idea was I had never ever done anything before. Then why would my blow jobs be so good?
2119000	2121720	And then she wasn't doing a bit. I was, I was like, are you,
2123080	2128920	like, she was like, so, I mean, it's yeah, I just try to justify. Yeah. She's trying to,
2128920	2134760	for her, that's a matter of actual good writer, internal logic. Yeah. Yeah. When ego fucks up
2134760	2143960	role play, essentially four or five though. I mean, that's a lot. I, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't
2143960	2150360	have been like, wait a minute, but because your character was not your character. Your character
2150360	2163560	was old, old helicopter pilot brand new private in the military. Joshua Koppel asks on Twitter,
2164440	2168840	is the community movie basically a no go asking for a friend? I don't, I don't know. I don't know
2168840	2173000	why I saved that question. I don't know. Here's the related question. Did you ever watch the TV
2173000	2181640	show the cape? I saw, I saw, uh, no. Oh man. It was great. There was an episode where there was
2181640	2186200	this autistic chick who could like murder people with math. It was great. Well, she didn't really
2186200	2190760	murder people. I think she just stopped in elevator or something. I don't know. Continue.
2192040	2199240	She could have, but she was a good person. You minus life equals and then they cloned her brain
2199240	2205320	and made her into a Siri console. And they were like, everyone can use this. It's a good show.
2207720	2214600	Because the, is that a cape power? The ability to make some bad guy was trying to, uh, make, make
2214600	2222200	series for everybody. But the, the bad part in prison, in prison, the chick. No, no, no,
2222200	2226520	you got so disappointed because there are so many great places to pitch a series right now.
2227160	2233800	That's true. Uh, yeah. Did you, did you guys know about that young lady who stayed at that
2233800	2240440	hotel in LA and then they found her body at the, in the water, uh, water downtown town? Uh,
2242440	2248200	funny at all. No, it's not, it's not. Is this recent? Are you guys, what's that? Sorry.
2249160	2259080	Oh, Lisa, Lisa lamb, lamb, lamb, lamb, lamb, like that. Okay. Oh, she's dead. Well, it's not, I mean.
2259960	2262760	Let's, let's not make lamb noises. Yeah, I was stricken suddenly with like, okay, well,
2262760	2268680	say her name. Uh, the guy behind you tried his best to make a joke out of it,
2268680	2273400	but there's no jokes to be had. Are you sure? Wait, the guy that, with the guy that went bad,
2273480	2277880	I think he was just, he was just trying to help, like, yes, it was like, I'm going to help you.
2277880	2283400	It was the perfect joke. Right. Perfect joke. It was also funny. Well, so it's still, it remains a
2283400	2287800	mystery what happened to her, but you get, but did you know about the whole, have you heard of the
2287800	2293800	elevator game? The, the, the, the, the, the, the, I never knew that. Start from the beginning. I
2293800	2300360	don't know what you're talking about. The Roberts are in the dark. Yes. Well, this young lady who
2300360	2305560	stayed at this hotel, which is an ancillary fact, it adds to the, to the spookiness of it,
2305560	2311160	that this hotel is downtown hotel. The one that it's the one that I can't remember what it's called.
2311160	2318280	Is it the downtown hotel? Oh, I don't know about, I don't know. Uh, you know, like,
2318280	2323560	apparently Richard Ramirez stayed there and I don't know, Sherlock Holmes broke his toe or
2323560	2329000	something. I don't know. But, uh, the, but she, she stayed there and then she, yeah, then they,
2329000	2334200	the, what the, the, well, the facts of the story are that she was there. Then she disappeared. She
2334200	2340040	was traveling alone. She was on some meds that she was then off. It was, uh, then she was, and
2340040	2344600	she was staying in a room with some people who testified to the fact that she, she was kind of
2344600	2351720	acting in an off her meds kind of way. But then she, sorry, sorry, somebody, somebody just yelled
2351720	2360920	out Mazel. I sound like Mazel Tov, like two Jewish people wanted to get married here, but
2360920	2368920	just awful time for a Mazel Tov, uh, terrible time. The, uh, wait for the middle of the sentence.
2370760	2373400	I'm treading lightly. And every time someone says something out loud, I'm like,
2374120	2379240	because we're in Los Angeles, there's 200 people in the room. Because, you know, statistically
2379240	2382360	speaking there might be somebody who was a friend of this person or whatever, but she was traveling.
2382360	2387880	I don't think she was from LA, but, uh, but anyways, the, so I'm trying not to be as crass
2387880	2392200	as I might be if I was moving very fast, telling this story, like dehumanizing her. But, uh, what
2392200	2397400	happened is she disappeared and, uh, then she was gone for a while. And then people were like,
2397400	2403400	this water tastes bad from the hotel. And then they eventually found her body in the water tower
2403400	2409240	for the hotel. It was just floating in there for a long time. And, uh, and so, but then the video
2409240	2415400	was released from the hotel, the security video of her on the elevator and she's behaving very
2415400	2420280	strangely in the elevator and it's very spooky and they, and they edited it before it was released.
2420280	2424360	And there's just a lot of like very strange things about the video and their release of it and their
2424360	2429480	editing of it. Like they changed the speed of it. And if you, um, and that they're, yeah. Anyways,
2429480	2436120	one of the, one of the curious things that came out of like the, the DIY sleuth boards that were
2436120	2440840	analyzing this thing that I never knew about was, uh, this thing called the elevator game, which is
2440840	2446600	this whole elaborate thing where if you go into an elevator, millennials believe, uh, and you,
2446600	2452200	and you prep because they think that elevators just grew out of the ground. They were, they're,
2452200	2457480	they're post elevator children. I mean, when, when I was a kid, I don't believe elevators are magic
2457480	2464280	because I saw them being invented. There were, we called them pulley cars when I was your age.
2465240	2468600	There's nothing magical about them. I want to Uber to the fifth floor.
2474600	2478360	Apparently there's an elevator game where it is like an urban legend thing where you,
2478920	2484440	you, you press elevator buttons in a certain order and then it's got all these instructions.
2484440	2487480	I wonder what the, please tell me. And then the devil come,
2489560	2494760	dangerous territory. I know. I'm a little scared to just pop open a, okay. It's terrifying.
2494760	2500040	Thank you. Look at my, I don't want, I want people to see my web history. Still dangerous.
2500920	2509320	Australian accent tips. Oh shit. He, huh? Jeff Daniels, Wikipedia, Kate Beckins, sales,
2509320	2516600	I am Jeff Daniels. Trump intelligence allegations. Donald Glover makes magic with touching speech
2516600	2523160	after winning best actor in a comedy series. The Wikipedia entry for spaniel. You've been trumped.
2523160	2528520	Trump intelligence allegations. FXX still work in progress. Update a network's pushing animation.
2528520	2535640	Let me see caliber, but all right, whatever. Wow. Okay. Hold on. Wait. I need to,
2535640	2544520	I'm, I'm really brave and bold for doing this, but yeah, be careful. I just want to, I'm really
2544520	2552520	nervous right now. Why am I nervous? I don't like this at all. This is not cool. The elevator game.
2552520	2560840	Get the fuck out of here. Urban legend ritual game from Korea. Oh, that means it's legit horror.
2560840	2569720	Uh, the, uh, the death of Eliza, Elisa lamb provided an opportunity to boost the game's
2569720	2574840	notoriety. That's a weird take on it. It was great for the game. Elevator game stock is through the
2574840	2580600	roof. Floor is to visit. The player must stay in the elevator for the entirety of this game and
2580600	2585880	press the following floor buttons in sequence. One, four, two, six, two, 10, five, one. The game
2585880	2590200	rules state that if the ritual succeeds, when the player finally presses, instead of going down to
2590200	2595000	the first floor, the elevator will, did a Korean write this? The elevator will return to the 10th
2595000	2601080	floor. Alternative world is the header of this next section. The game goal is to access quote,
2601080	2606280	another world unquote the 10th floor should lead to an alternative reality where nobody exists
2606280	2611960	except for the player, uh, traveled back steps must be done in the same sequence. Then to the
2611960	2615880	fifth floor, then the final button will return the player to the first floor. The game rules,
2615880	2618840	ask the player to check for small things to be sure they are back in the real world.
2619400	2622680	Uh, the fifth floor ghost girl. That's what I was interested in. At the fifth floor,
2622680	2630520	a girl could appear in person or disguised, uh, luring the player. The game rules state
2630520	2634440	the girl must not be talked to. That was the creepy thing. That's not even in this thing.
2634440	2639240	Hey, who are you on a specific floor? There's a girl on this on a specific floor. There's
2639240	2644840	a girl that gets on the elevator and she says, where are you going? Do not answer her. That's
2644920	2651960	the creepy thing. That's fun. Isn't it? Yeah. Anyways, I just thought, you know, this elevator
2651960	2656760	has the ability not, not only to take you to another place, but also to conjure a ghost.
2656760	2660600	Well, and they, and the full idea that I read about it was that at the end of this thing,
2660600	2665240	the most you can accomplish is just, you get to this alternate reality and you get to a floor
2665240	2669640	and there's a door ahead of you and you'll never make it to the door. But you, the, I think the
2669640	2673720	best you can do is like walk for a while and then pass out. And then you wake up in a random
2673720	2679560	location. So then everybody's like, like a water tower, except for this young lady's parents who
2679560	2685880	are like, it's not a bit. Yeah. Maybe someone killed her. All right. You know what I think?
2685880	2690840	Probably someone killed her. People don't teleport into water towers.
2693240	2698680	It's coming from the dungeon master. I know a lot about teleportation.
2698680	2704280	The tough thing is that she was in there for so long that there's no possibility of any kind of,
2704280	2708360	like there, she was, she was, this is, this is awful to say, but there's no, she, you know,
2708360	2714840	she was like, she was sort of anything that could have provided a clue. Significant decomposition.
2714840	2719480	She was like, yeah, she was sort of dissolved. People were bathing in this and drinking this.
2719480	2722760	And they were, those people all, I mean, I don't know what kind of settlements they got,
2722760	2730600	but they were drinking traveler for like days. It was like a sickly sweet odor in the thing.
2732040	2736520	They always say that about death. Sickly sweet. Yeah. It must be true.
2742520	2747240	Jesus. Will we see any commentary on the 2016 election, the Trump administration,
2747240	2752440	a Rick and Morty season three? No, we will not. Oh, because it's, we were, we just, just raced
2752440	2757640	right out of that bit. Yeah. In the set mouth. Do you think it's possible to ever really know
2757640	2764920	another person at Julia seven asks, do you think it's possible to ever really know another person?
2766760	2774360	No. Because that's a girl just cackling like a, because apparently a witch just snuck in the
2775160	2777960	like a, like a Home Depot witch decoration. The ghost girl
2781000	2790200	who's Tituba. There's a two drink maximum tonight, folks.
2794760	2799640	You know what we could do? I actually, I have a lightning round of Twitter questions and I
2799640	2808680	thought I could, uh, lightning round. What is the answer to the question we should ask you? Yes.
2811400	2813320	What's your favorite pastry and pinatas
2815880	2822680	using your socks as napkins. That's cool. Right. If you're alone major in college journalism
2823960	2827800	with a minor in psychology, but I dropped out halfway through my freshman year. So what it
2827800	2831560	doesn't matter. What is your advice to young writers who are scared to take chances in our
2831560	2836440	nation's current political climate? Uh, write about being scared to take chances.
2841480	2844360	Is the Rick mobile real? I think so. Yeah, it seems to be
2845800	2852280	Knight writer to the a team Knight writer. What's the project you've most enjoyed working on
2852280	2857240	this show? I think I like this show. Uh, what happened to your elliptical periscope sessions?
2857240	2866040	Fuck you. All right. No, I'm gonna, I'm thank you for, thank you. Thank you. Daffy. Daffy woods.
2867320	2870920	That's good that you, uh, had all those questions lined up for yourself there.
2872760	2874200	Yeah. You couldn't get any for Rob.
2876120	2879720	You got like nine people on stage. We're listening to you answer questions.
2879720	2889240	I mean, you could have elaborated as well. Oh, no.
2893640	2899320	All right. Well, I'll, I'll, I'll pick a topic that you guys can join in on. Let's go to psychology.
2900840	2906120	All right. Action and thought. Yes. On both of them. So my therapist,
2907000	2917560	my therapist blew my mind on Friday. She said, uh, your thoughts, you will never lead to action.
2917560	2921320	Your thoughts are kind of a, well, some of this I'm putting words in her mouth, but this is my
2921320	2926440	interpretation of it. Your thoughts are kind of ever never going to be more than kind of a,
2926440	2932280	a catalog and analysis of the, of the, of your experiences and behaviors. Like
2933240	2937640	you can't actually, if you just keep thinking about action, it'll never result in action.
2938440	2944600	Whereas if you do things, it'll result in new thought. So you have to act to create new thought.
2944600	2949720	You can't think to create new action. And that really made sense to me and also bummed me the
2949720	2953960	fuck out. Cause as with the elliptical thing, it's like, yeah, I have to get on the elliptical.
2953960	2958680	The answer to what happened to the elliptical sessions is I stopped doing it because maybe a
2958680	2963400	vacation or maybe a bad mood or a holiday or something, some excuse I had something that
2963400	2967480	interrupted, I can't get on the elliptical. And then, so then my behavior changed and then my
2967480	2972680	thought changed and my thought never started. And it's like the, I have to just get on the goddamn
2972680	2976680	elliptical at which point my thought will change again. And it's kind of a bummer cause you're
2976680	2983080	like, so I have to like, you have to do shit that you don't really think about doing in order to
2983080	2990600	think new stuff. That sucks. Or you, you know, because we're creatives, we get shit on for not
2990600	2995560	having a nine to five necessarily. So when we want to go to like the beach or go thrift shopping or
2995560	3001960	go do something that seems like it's anti-productive, we feel guilty, but the act of like getting up and
3001960	3006840	walking around, even if it's to do something that's kind of bullshit actually steers us back
3006840	3013880	into writing and being creative. But we never get taught that. We always get, keep your claps
3013880	3022840	for creation. Half y'all motherfuckers should be at home writing right now. Don't try to professionally
3022840	3031560	procrastinate with me. I go see Dan Harmon. You should be writing in your journal. So it sucks
3032040	3036920	cause we get told like we want to fuck off and drink, smoke a little pot, do something on just
3036920	3042840	a Tuesday at noon, but we get told that's shameful. You shouldn't do that, but it's actually for us.
3042840	3046600	That's garbage. Yeah, that's total garbage. Cody just went through this. She's 12 years younger
3046600	3056520	than me. Uh, which is, it's weird cause her blow jobs are like a 50 year old. That is worse.
3058040	3066520	But, uh, the, the, the seems like you've done this 900,000 times. The, um, the, the, she,
3066520	3071080	but I'm, cause she's 12 years younger than me. So I'm kind of watching another writer go through
3071080	3076280	a lot of shit that I have gone through and I'm, I'm an, I have my own problems, but, uh, uh, but,
3076280	3082760	but I, I do know for sure. Like I tell her cause I watch first of all, the fact that like, you know,
3082760	3086920	just like, like Dorothy Parker said, I hate writing. I, I, I love having written like that's
3086920	3095080	what she, I watch her like, like hate the process and then she just wants everybody to read her shit
3095080	3101000	and like she gets this like fix for five seconds of like, Oh, I did a good job. And then this crash
3101640	3108360	but, um, also just like the endless punishment of the self for not writing, which doesn't really
3108360	3115400	make any sense because it's like you, you have to just like, kind of be depressed a little bit.
3115400	3120440	It is part of the process. You're like a, you're like a little cauldron or an oven. You're not
3120440	3124600	going to be like a happy camper the whole time. If you're making something that consists of,
3125320	3130520	of all of the emotional things that human beings go through when they go through a story, like
3131400	3135240	part of that is going to be you being all bummed out with yourself and like sleeping
3135240	3139560	or playing video games or, or, or just getting high and like beating your head against the wall
3139560	3143160	or watching Ben Affleck movies. Like you're, you're just doing all the things that people
3143160	3149240	do to torture themselves. The, the, the, the, you, you do the, the, and, and like,
3149240	3154120	but here's the crazy thing that happened. Like Cody was like, she wrote two scripts that were,
3154120	3157960	that were really good. She did it. She did her job. She, she had, had a deal to write these
3157960	3162360	two scripts and she wrote them and she turned them in and, and they're like, these are great.
3162360	3167160	Can we get two more? Which is like their way of saying these two are great. And I knew that
3167160	3170600	would happen. Then she's like, okay, I gotta do two more. And then she just, and she was like,
3170600	3175320	I'll have them done tomorrow. Cause she was on this high, which is also fine to be wrong,
3175320	3178520	to be wrong about what you think you're going to be able to do. But then, and then she crashed.
3178520	3181960	She's like, wait, I don't feel like writing anymore. And then she was like, I feel so sad.
3181960	3185560	And I was like, you're supposed to feel sad. Just lay there. And it's like this weird conversation
3185640	3189960	to have with somebody where they're like, I feel sad. I feel untalented. I feel
3189960	3193800	not like doing anything. I feel like laying here like a lump. And to say to somebody,
3194680	3197240	that's what you should be doing. That's what you should be feeling.
3197240	3201000	How long do you recommend that goes on? I mean, eventually you're going to have to
3201000	3206360	get back to work, right? But it's a, it's, it's a couple of weeks. I don't know. It kind of depends.
3206360	3211080	It's the masterpiece race. If you make a masterpiece, it could go on for the next 30
3211080	3216440	years. Cause it's so hard to turn out a masterpiece in your lifetime. But if you're not,
3216440	3219800	if you haven't turned on a masterpiece, your ass should probably wake up every day at nine.
3222440	3228360	But she, she, she went through a couple of weeks where she finally, because her therapist and I
3228360	3231480	were saying the same thing, which is like, you're fine. You're doing what you're supposed to do.
3231480	3236440	Just lay there like a lump and watch forensic files. And, and that's what we did for weeks.
3236440	3242280	And then the really funny thing was that at the end of it, she, she got up one morning and she
3242280	3247800	was like, I gotta get out of here. I gotta go. I gotta go somewhere. And I gotta, I gotta,
3247800	3251160	I gotta write. I think I'm going to go into a hotel for a couple of days. And I immediately
3251160	3257800	was like, what the fuck? It took me a whole day to realize I was, I was like, I'm sorry.
3257800	3264120	I didn't like, cause it was like, I had become the cocoon. And so for her to finish, it's,
3264120	3271560	it's not like a butterfly goes like, I'm stoked about being in a cocoon, slippity doo da flying
3271560	3277640	away. Um, do we have to pay for that? If I said that on the stream, the, the, but of course you're
3277640	3282280	gonna be like, the first thing that you're going to do, isn't going to be like, I feel like writing.
3282280	3286360	You're going to be like frustrated and go like, God damn it. I fucking can't stand it anymore.
3286360	3291560	Which is different from, I feel so dead. I feel like I can't do anything. Those are two different
3291560	3296760	things. If you feel irritation, that's like a coming out of an egg or a chrysalis. You're like,
3296760	3303320	look, fuck, I can't fuck it. You should follow that impulse. Like I want out of here. I want to
3303320	3308520	go do something. Even if that thing isn't writing, you got to go do that. But I, at the time, the
3308520	3313160	funny thing is that I, my immediate reaction was like, fuck you. You get to warn me about this
3313160	3316520	stuff. You can't just decide you're going to go check out. And then I was like, wait a minute.
3316520	3320440	What am I, what did I expect? How did I expect this process to end? I am the cocoon. I'm going
3320440	3326040	to get ripped apart and she's going to leave me to go be a butterfly for a second and write
3326040	3333960	a script over the weekend and probably fuck a hundred dudes. With the professional ability
3333960	3345320	of a 50 year old. Anyways, action and thought. So tomorrow, even though I don't think I'm going to,
3345320	3349800	I'm going to get back on the elliptical and then I'm going to like think that I should get a,
3349800	3355160	because when I was on that, it took no time at all for me to be like, I would be like late for
3355160	3361160	meetings because my compulsion was to get on the elliptical once I was doing it. It's just like
3361160	3367160	Newtonian laws. Like you, if you're doing it, you tend to keep doing it. If you stop, you tend to
3367160	3373320	stay stop stopped. And I'm not being one of those preachy exercise people on my, not to my, my
3373320	3380040	listeners, but, um, uh, that's the sad thing is like, you gotta just like do some crazy. If that's
3380040	3387960	what this podcast turned into, it's like a health, health podcast, like, uh, like, well, I mean,
3389000	3395000	if I just started change fighting with Joe Rogan, I just pushing like different vitamins and stuff.
3395000	3402920	You gotta take your sponsored by a GNC brought to you. I'm telling you, bulletproof. I'm drinking
3402920	3410920	these ginseng Vicodin shakes. My, my, my, my, I was losing my hair, but now there's dicks growing
3410920	3418120	out of my head. I'm like, it's called the Medusa zone. And you gotta do it. You gotta go through
3418120	3421160	this process. You gotta have a hundred dicks growing out of your head and jerk them all off.
3421160	3425880	And the calm, you're going to keep that calm and put it in the freezer because it's not
3425880	3431400	calm. It's vitamins. Keep that calm. Gotta keep that calm. It's not calm. It's vitamins. Yep.
3435640	3439640	Uh, and another, another thing I've been talking to, to Cody about cause
3440600	3447720	is like, it's the, for, for those of you who are actively writing, uh, here's something that I've
3447720	3452600	never really, that took me like 20 years to figure out you, you, you know, there's two modes
3452600	3457160	of writing, which is like, sometimes I equate to sometimes you're the chess piece and sometimes
3457160	3460600	you're the chess player. Like sometimes you're like, you have to like get immersed in your own
3460600	3465880	shit and that can be counterproductive because you should be thinking structurally. Like, so
3465880	3470200	you all know if you're, if you've ever tried to write that, you know, you get stuck on page one
3470200	3473960	because anything can happen and you're like, what the fuck's supposed to happen? And with,
3473960	3477800	you know, at that point you should be thinking structurally like more macro,
3477800	3482280	but she also don't want to just be a hack. That's like, well, every story is like this and it goes
3482280	3489080	like that. Like the magic happens inside the story. So what I'm just realizing watching
3489080	3494760	Cody work is that I think that I've been making a mistake of thinking that you're supposed to
3494760	3499720	think structurally up until a point where your structure is done. And then you're supposed to
3499720	3508120	think immersively, but you may never finish that structural work because it may start to
3508120	3513720	generate all kinds of question marks and you actually find your structural inspiration by
3513720	3519240	going into your shitty fucked up structural story and like living in it as a passenger
3519240	3525480	where you can clearly see what's going wrong. So I think the better metaphor now that I'm landing
3525480	3530600	on is it's like, it's like train tracks is the structure. Like you could, you could say willy
3530600	3536680	nilly and probably should be more willy and nilly in structure because you don't want to waste too
3536680	3541800	much time on structure. Just say, for instance, this is going to go from Chicago to Philadelphia.
3541800	3546440	That's like saying like boy meets girl, boy, you can lose this girl, boy, you just like whatever
3546440	3550600	your story, your basic story is, knowing that it's going to change. Like it's just a plan. It's
3550600	3555080	going to go from Chicago to Philadelphia. You could, if you really don't have any further
3555080	3559560	passion about it, I guess you could get meticulous and go and it's going to go over this river and
3559560	3563320	all this stuff, but you're still just thinking structurally and the truth is the thing that
3563320	3569320	makes your movie, TV show, poem, whatever you're working on good is stuff that happens inside a
3569320	3576040	train car and like some stuff makes use of the fact that you can tell you're on a train, call that
3576040	3582040	maybe meta or like a high concept or something where it's like wow, I can really feel the
3582040	3586360	structure as I'm riding in this train car, but then other stuff is like I didn't even know I was
3586360	3590280	on a train. Yeah, because they just said it goes from Chicago to Philadelphia and it's level the
3590280	3595720	whole time and it's quiet and but really it's just like a thing that happens inside a box car.
3597320	3603320	And I think that you have to, I think we have to go back and forth. I think you have to lay track
3603320	3608600	or lay plans for track and then you got to get in the car and then go okay, Chicago to Philadelphia.
3608680	3614760	Let's see how that works and let it be like screech, fucked up, that just makes no sense and then
3614760	3621880	change it from to Chicago to Florida or because that's a city right? The story of a person who
3621880	3628600	failed geography becoming a writer and telling people what to do. You change the generalities
3628600	3634600	because they're easy to change then you get back in. I think it's important not to have an end goal
3634600	3640600	when you're working on structure or when you're working within. You got to get out of either. It's
3640600	3645240	almost like I don't know what to do with this new epiphany. How are you doing Rob? Are you having a
3645240	3650280	good time? Yes. Okay. No, this is good. This is really good stuff. Okay, I was I was I couldn't
3650280	3655640	tell if you were listening or wanting to kill yourself. Sometimes you're the one who invents
3655640	3660040	a new structure. It's almost like you have to say set like an egg timer. It's kind of thing where
3660040	3665240	it's like okay I worked on structure now I have to force myself to do that thing where I'm like
3665240	3669880	yeah but what does Mikey feel like in the in the scene but then you have to also not get sucked
3669880	3673560	into that for too long because that'll drive you nuts. Yes. It's like you have to go back and forth.
3673560	3678600	It's like if you were building a tube you would want to be outside the tube and inside the tube
3678600	3683880	at equal amounts of time. You don't want to spend too much time like tube constructing. Are there
3683880	3689640	any tube workers here? Anybody work on tubes? Because there's shit on the inside of the tube
3689640	3692600	that you're not even going to realize until you get in there and you're like oh man I didn't know
3692600	3698920	I was making this out of. So what's the transition like between uh moving from inside the tube to
3698920	3706120	outside the tube? I don't well I mean it's no what is that no for real I'm not making a joke.
3706120	3709800	Well I kind of feel like you could characterize it as like working on a white board or with note
3709800	3714120	cards versus like actually sitting at the keyboard and like like where you're typing dialogue that's
3714120	3718600	an easy distinction. That's kind of how I characterize it but that could be different
3718680	3723560	for other people because I feel like when I sit down and start typing dialogue I'm like inside
3723560	3729080	the thing. Right. And so I'm actually like I might jump from character to character but I'm
3729080	3733880	but I'm actually sealed within the reality. You're not building it you're smoothing it out.
3733880	3738360	Right but then there's but then if I'm standing at a white board you know it's like okay what
3738360	3743240	should happen you know then you're you're having these like weird conversations that God has about
3743240	3749080	people like what if what if a bunch of people got cancer hardy har har I'm God I don't give a fuck.
3749080	3756920	Do you do you uh do you structure like per scene or just the whole the whole thing the whole story
3756920	3762520	like if you're working on like oh I've got to work on this scene today you structure out the scene
3762520	3768760	and then go in? No I'm not what am I productive I don't know no I don't I don't I don't I don't
3769240	3775560	I don't have a process yet. I'm like whatever we worked in TV on Community and Rick and Morty
3775560	3783880	like the thing that the the nature of the beast becomes break the story and then take the broken
3783880	3788920	story and send it to outline and then take the outline and send it to script and I kind of and
3788920	3794280	but then we end up re-breaking everything we always end up re-breaking and then and then and
3794360	3801400	we look at that as like a crime like we're like Andy Bobrow was the fire marshal uh for uh on
3801400	3806840	Community like they because it was like some fire paramount like building code thing like he was the
3806840	3811640	official fire fire steward or something like he was the guy whose job it was to know when there
3811640	3817240	was a fire so they paramount like showed him a closet where there was an orange vest and two
3817240	3821960	cones or two highlights this is serious yeah and he would but he would he would of course there
3821960	3826040	was never a fire but he would he would grab them when there was a re-break and he would run down
3826040	3834440	the halls of paramount and go re-break made me feel like shit because the joke was not me because
3834440	3842200	it was oh we work on a psychos show there's a re-break happening why can't why can't you just
3842200	3847320	air why can't you just air what we wrote yesterday and get an Emmy you fucking narcissist
3848120	3854120	fucking dumb fat blowhard is that you or Bobrow
3855560	3860040	yeah it's it's Dan I think it's it's Dan I'm not gonna call Andy Bobrow a big fat blowhard
3861880	3862360	uh
3864760	3870120	this I told I told Brandon to yeah yeah I told Brandon to make a face
3870920	3875240	uh the the face of someone who had been told they were the culture icon
3877000	3881720	Dan was working so hard on this before that's why we were so late no that's not that's not
3882600	3887480	really that's not why we're truly we were waiting along with you upstairs yeah we were waiting on
3887480	3896760	Steve Levy yeah Steve Levy's fault can we get a pillow for Steve he's just like hanging out
3896760	3906840	he loves it he looks good he looks sad lonely health care oh nice oh I texted this dispenser
3906840	3910840	and then I saved it because I thought it was a good observation conservatives act like socialism
3910840	3914440	is the opposite of capitalism but their whole perception of poor people is inherently socialist
3914440	3917960	because they expect their pursuit of happiness to generate so much revenue that even the people
3917960	3921800	they fuck over have less to gain by slitting their throats that's one big fucking federal
3921800	3928200	program and that funding just got cut uh because poor people are mad and they're gonna get sick
3928200	3932200	and they're getting sick in both parties and we're we're in a real fucking emergency situation here
3932200	3935480	like these are the beginning this health care thing seems like something you've been hearing
3935480	3940200	about your whole life but the the the the thresholds that have been crossed now are like
3940200	3947320	so fucking official like like it's like it really is let them eat cake like feudal europe level
3947320	3952440	shit like like to say that because underneath all this stuff people act like they're arguing
3952440	3958120	about math and concepts and philosophies because no one is going to profit or live through the day
3958120	3962840	by saying what's really happening which is rich people are just saying look times are tough all
3962840	3972440	over uh living long is uh is a luxury it's like cable tv uh tesla's uh your kid going to college
3972440	3977000	these are these are privileges uh and you should either be born rich if you want those things or
3977080	3980920	you should work really fucking hard or get really lucky and that's what capitalism is and like i
3980920	3984520	don't see why you people are bitching so much and why we should have to pay for your your aids and
3984520	3990840	your cancer uh and and i'm telling like when i went to fiji it was like i like like the life
3990840	3996600	expectancy of the people that work by the pool is like fucking 20 years less they got great water
3996600	4002040	that that that that in spite of the great water i love their water this is a real thing if you if
4002120	4006840	you look at i'll pay extra for their water yeah the waters if you look at third world countries
4006840	4012360	that have resort sentiment stuff it's just like that is the way that your republican congressmen
4012360	4020440	see the future like they they don't see a problem with the idea that being poor should equate to a
4020440	4027000	20 year less lifespan like like like and that's what's really being said to you right now is uh
4027240	4032280	yeah enough's enough like like like we lived in la la land along enough of this idea that that
4032280	4036680	everyone was going to have coverage if you get cancer and you're poor then you're going to die
4036680	4040040	that's that is the real conversation that's happening and i don't know why i'm lecturing
4040040	4043480	you like you don't know that but i just say like like like i just want to say it out loud because
4043480	4047480	like some of us i think we're walking around going is that what's really being said right now
4047480	4054440	or because we're so used to this chatter of like oh i think so uh uh i was senator so-and-so just
4054440	4060040	said blah blah blah uh because it's called this senator it's like we kind of like are still in
4060040	4064680	this mode where we're calling each other out on semantics but we've gotten to a point where the
4064680	4069960	semantics don't matter the actual fundamental thought that's being uh could communicate it
4069960	4075800	to us is that they actually think that you should die they're actually telling you to fuck off and
4075800	4081000	die and and they're saying it in different ways and people are at town halls going you're telling
4081000	4086280	us to fuck off and die we see you we hear you that's what you're saying and they're running
4086280	4091160	out of the town halls and hiding and they just they just did this thing anyway in spite they're
4091160	4096040	saying like they're just going they're just doing what they were going to do anyway it's fucking
4096040	4106600	insane um i i i i i have no solutions as usual the the resist we have solutions do you have any idea
4106600	4110280	how much harder it is to do what they've just done for the last two months than it is to call
4110280	4115960	for impeachment like google bill clinton impeach like like like they fucking know how to do this
4115960	4123160	shit democrat republican congress people know how to move to impeach it's not that difficult like
4123160	4128680	like and everyone is just they're just holdovers from a different time i don't know what to do do
4128680	4134040	we grab pitchforks we're they're killing us they're gonna kill us we continue to monetize the
4134040	4141000	democratic push for 2018 we take congress back we all can write legislation that's the great thing
4141000	4146920	about america is that any one in this room could write a bill and then push it you you would start
4146920	4154520	at your state level so we are kind of fucked but we we do outnumber them there is hope we are
4154520	4161080	learning am i right are we learning how to mobilize also here in california especially because we have
4161080	4169880	one of the largest gdps in the world number six like yeah number six guys six that's pretty good
4171000	4176360	uh so that that actually commands a lot of power you're talking about california yeah
4176360	4181480	california that's right yeah i want to like i every time i talk about politics we end up
4181480	4185320	realizing the solution is to act locally clean up our own shit and then set an example for the
4185320	4191720	outlying territories but yeah like fucking california should like just become we don't have to
4191720	4197000	secede we can functionally secede by being the oldest state in the union that's in the black
4197000	4204280	say is is right on the money this is secession people right but i mean come on it's just not
4204280	4210440	well it's like why but i think it's just like an extreme thing they say to to let's talk about
4210440	4218040	these issues and my producing partner came up with a great idea he's i knew the producing you
4218040	4225720	were doing wasn't solo i knew it all right i got a good one going there i have a partner there's
4225720	4236920	always i have a partner or two um he is doing a uh he's right he's having a lawyer draw up a
4236920	4247800	ballot initiative right now to rid california's pension fund of all everything that's not SRIs
4247800	4257160	socially responsible investments and that will fuck fuck the whole world if we do that you know
4257160	4266280	what i mean okay no because we invest a lot in tobacco and uh thank you the rest of the oil
4266280	4273800	and oil and stuff if we stop if the sixth largest gdp in the country stops investing
4274520	4280680	in oil and tobacco and and things like that then there that will send a message
4281640	4288040	that's the only way to to have the rest of the country give a fuck about us i wish there was
4288040	4294200	a way that california could have its own health they're pushing for single player single payer
4294200	4300760	so california will eventually have its own um health like health plan system so i know i know
4300760	4307000	that people are really trying like you said rob of making california be the place that people learn
4307160	4312360	how to do things across the country and that that can happen because we're we're sort of light years
4312360	4318760	ahead of the country as we speak we should like the the amazing thing would be california as the
4318760	4323560	liberal version of the iron bank and game of thrones that we're just like that with every
4323560	4329240	state that starts to go bankrupt because of free market deregulation and then their rivers start
4329240	4334200	to be filled with bloodthirsty scorpions like they come to us and we come out in robes and go like
4335160	4339720	hmm well let's open the books like ideally looks like you have three congressmen that
4339720	4344520	are nazis like i don't think that's a good investment for us i recall it was you go back
4344520	4349720	to your people and have some rallies and clean up your your state because we have an election
4349720	4355240	coming up and california doesn't want to live in shit land uh you failed to legalize marijuana is
4355240	4366120	not true but you know california like like you know we're the bluest state in the union and you
4366120	4371720	still saw the numbers like one out of three out of ten people at your trader joe's like secretly
4371720	4378040	voted for trump it's like um those people aren't really like at trader joe's in los angeles but no
4378040	4385960	no they they traded joe's at in in yeah the empire trader joe's it's like yeah trader jethro's
4389960	4392680	well a garlic stuffed mess what
4395320	4404920	organic um the the but yeah i i i it sucks because we were chilling man and now we all
4404920	4410600	gotta get busy yeah we had such a great time we were having a great time we were having such a
4410600	4417320	good time we were having a good time but but aren't you worried about the did you better off like
4418280	4426760	like better off now are you are you are you uh are you you're not a trump supporter but
4426760	4429720	but you're you're better off now because we're energized
4429880	4431880	oh
4431880	4433960	yeah now you now you're involved
4439640	4443800	oh man come on by all means interrupt them
4445880	4449080	something that does concern me or that i see it coming i was like i think there's going to be a
4449080	4453720	bunch of republicans or libertarians libertarians that that in the next couple years they're going
4453720	4458600	to start receding to a position of they're going to go we're just rupticons like we
4459560	4464040	we didn't we never supported trump or believed that he was good for the country we just saw that
4464040	4470360	you libtard snowflakes needed some shaking up and we were right about that and i can't wait to spit
4470360	4475720	in their face and like i i like but i yeah i'm just so panicked about it's the it's the whole
4475720	4482200	bernie hillary holdover it's this it's the socialist versus the the liberals like the the
4482280	4489720	this thing of like i i it's like the republican party got hacked decimated and then repaired
4489720	4495880	like right now they're like suturing through their greed they're like coalescing and going like
4495880	4501320	but at the end of the day we love money and they're and they're they're solidifying and
4501320	4507960	the democrats are going like remember that thing you said on that march motherfucker like like
4507960	4513800	we're we're we're in danger of further fragmentization in a in a way but it's like and
4513800	4519320	it's this whole conundrum where you're like you want to fight the death star and there's
4519320	4524360	no better way to do it it seems by then by constructing a bigger space station that can
4524360	4529240	destroy more planets and how do you do that except well we should have more black in our
4529240	4533160	costumes and we should and then and then there's the people that keep going what are we doing
4533160	4539160	stop yeah like like one of the issues is that we didn't i think the left didn't know um how
4539160	4545400	fragmented it was it is i think a lot of people on that side assumed that we had gotten past some
4545400	4550280	things like racism and misogyny and what we're learning about ourselves i think is that there's
4550280	4554520	still a lot of bullshit in our own party so it's hard for us to come together i'd say and we're
4554520	4564040	also learning i hope that it's called fucking politics and democracy because if the issues are
4564040	4569800	super fundamental and you're fighting for things that are as fundamental as like almost like people
4569800	4577400	should have water then that means the war you're fighting is between armies so big a huge majority
4577400	4583080	of the people fighting side by side with you are going to be fucking stupid because most people
4583080	4589480	are dumb so if you're waiting for a political party that's going to one be all smart people
4589480	4597000	and two win then you're a fucking idiot that's just on the sidelines like statler and waldorf
4597000	4604120	just going like oh more like muppet stupid uh like i'm i'm just not impressed by that anymore
4604120	4608920	like i used to be one of those guys you know i was like i was like a fucking like weird third
4608920	4616760	party the guy and now i'm like fucking cucked out and then like i'm i'm livid up and dimmed down
4616760	4626120	and cut out and lived out i'm eating that hillary pussy and fucking like i don't know man i'm just
4626120	4631800	because i'm just like fucking we gotta because i nothing it's the thing that shook me up my fragile
4631800	4638200	straight white like like eggshell was yeah the idea that oh so if i just keep sitting here and
4638200	4644200	going you know why that's stupid you know why that doesn't make sense you know i all i need is
4644200	4650520	a blaster by my side i don't believe in no force um that if i keep doing that i'm gonna end up
4650520	4655720	living in a universe controlled by lizard people like and then that's no good for my smuggling
4655720	4662920	neither and and so i'm so i'm just like yeah i was like i'm not just gonna like keep going yeehaw
4662920	4668200	at the end of the movie i need to like actually like notarize shit i don't know fucking what that
4668200	4674120	hell he's supposed to do i just i'm just like i just i have amends to make and i was like okay
4674120	4678600	i'm fucking sorry it keeps flickering remember that thoughts and action thing this is a great
4678600	4683560	place to merge all that yeah so that's so i went i went to i went to that one march
4687480	4691960	yeah and i came up with this great story well we're gonna well we have here at starburns

4818840	4822920	mention it because we were rob and i are constantly saying we suck dick and you suck dick and suck a
4822920	4833720	dick and and yeah and i i've tried to remove all of the gay is uh stupid gay is lame gay derogatory
4833720	4839480	stuff from my regular parlance it's it's it's you know i catch myself now and then but like i see
4839480	4844760	the i see they're hurting that and i try to i've been but but and then and then there's like this
4844760	4851400	curtain that i recognize where i'm like oh when you say uh two people like two same-sex corrupt
4851400	4858360	politicians whose relationship you're trying to satirize for its inappropriate level of intimacy
4858360	4865640	in spite of not supposing to be connected like to say they're sucking each other's dicks um are you
4866440	4872840	are how much homophobia parts per million are you smelling in that because i don't think it
4872840	4877080	should be binary and they go that's homophobic or that's not i want to respect a gay person that
4877080	4882280	would say you know what that smells pretty much like you hate gay people and you're hiding behind
4882280	4887960	a couple of technical things like a like a like a date on the thing but yeah it's kind of a it's
4887960	4893560	kind of a puzzler because it's like well i could definitely see if you if your car breaks down and
4893560	4900600	you say my car sucks dick i think that that's way on the other side of the line that i've
4900600	4904840	learned to recognize right like well i think you're saying your car is gay because it broke down
4905560	4909800	and you're saying your car doesn't you don't like your car and you're and you're you're
4909800	4915560	equating that with the car engaging engaging there's so much more involved than i am i i
4915560	4920360	but i mean these are words by the way that no one was ever consciously employing for those
4920360	4924600	purposes but it's just like you're you but then we're all taking a lot of another look through
4924600	4929240	them but that's what i'm saying like when i looked through them again i was like yeah yeah if you say
4929240	4933160	like like i would sit in the community edit bay and i'd go like oh get rid of that shot that's
4933240	4938680	fucking gay and then like and then after a while like somebody told me the editor was gay and i
4938680	4943960	was like what the fuck and i and i and i and i apologize i was like by the way i'm so sorry i
4943960	4949000	grew up in the 70s in the midwest and i i think i've been saying i think i've been saying that a
4949000	4953640	lot of shit is gay when i mean it's bad and i'm really sorry about that and i and i and i was
4953640	4960440	actually still at the time i was going like oh i violated protocol uh and and but then he said in
4960440	4965800	accepting my apology he goes well i was never going to say anything but i'm glad you apologize
4965800	4974680	because uh when i hear that word i go back to a playground in my head where i was finding out i
4974680	4979800	was different and was finding out that that was a bad thing and that the people in control of me
4980760	4985640	could like just make me feel bad for who you know and he just is like like in a human way and i
4985640	4991960	was just like oh the worst so then i'm like okay i'm not gonna but so then there's just now this
4991960	4999640	new frontier of like well colbert said implied that trump is sucking on putin's cock as to
4999640	5006200	characterize the level of corrupt relationship between them is that still do we have to do we
5006200	5017480	have to hedge we we whack we do we do typical black man always with your boundaries about
5017480	5026520	homosexuality your community is so first to worship gay people we do love you rupaul we love you
5026520	5035080	um it's it maybe it's that the act started with women that makes us start there right not necessarily
5035160	5039640	even starting with the idea that servicing a cock at all there you go woman or gay man it's like oh
5039640	5046440	you're the weaker person because you you slobber on my knobber we're so sick we're so sexist that
5046440	5051640	it makes us homophobic but but but then but then i and i know this isn't a technical issue but i
5051640	5055320	don't know how else to talk about it other than that but it's like but but then i go like well
5055320	5060280	wait a minute no there's a two guys so someone's getting their dick sucked and it's not the it's
5060280	5065720	not a stronger person necessarily like there is no inherent to say two politicians that happen to
5065720	5071880	be male neither of them has a vagina no like if like oh trump well trump wasn't uh well of course
5071880	5076040	wasn't going to vote that way in the un because of course he's all up in putin's butt where he's
5076040	5082760	sucking putin's cock is i mean it is we'll break that down for me just for the sake of it um the
5082760	5089160	deal is that if we had a great deal of respect for people who suck cocks to begin with that joke
5089160	5095560	wouldn't play but because we always always put down the person right because we never say he's
5095560	5101320	eating her out well we never we don't say we don't we don't we don't say oh the prime minister of this
5101320	5107720	is like obviously eating her pussy like we don't say that right and then when you it's the craziest
5107720	5113000	thing to hear a man talk about how he got a deal on a car or how you got a deal on a house in front
5113000	5118040	of his wife or his girlfriend because he got fucked he'll be like man i i was supposed to
5118040	5121720	pay ten thousand but i only pay eight thousand i told that motherfucker suck my dick ain't that
5121720	5127960	what i told him baby suck my dick suck my dick baby suck my oops you are a person who sucks my dick
5128840	5133560	and that's where it fucking starts all right if we had handled it and this is the shittiest thing
5133560	5138040	about shit like that is that if motherfuckers would just handle their shit we could go back
5138040	5144040	to telling the full wide range of jokes right you know like if you were if you were racist or sexist
5144120	5149480	or homophobic the material that we could fuck with would be amazing that's the thing like in
5149480	5154440	the 70s it was like shit was getting edgier chevy chase said the n-word to richard priors face in a
5154440	5160120	sketch on snl right i'm not saying we peaked progressively there like that's our that's our
5160120	5166680	goal so we just want to be able to say the n-word to black people on tv i i but but we were we were
5166680	5176040	you can say it we were we were we were more racist by our definitions now but we were also
5176040	5183880	comedically bolder that's just like like it's different from uh sinatra and the rat pack like
5183880	5190760	abusing sammy as if he was uh not a human being like we look at the 60s comedy and oh don rickel
5190760	5195080	said this or that but then he'd say we all love each other and stuff like but the the the idea
5195080	5201800	of the experimentation the fascination people like like saying look uh cards on the table i
5201800	5206840	don't understand this or that or that that area i think that's what really scared us comedically
5206840	5212760	philosophically and it and it threatened some kind of uh deep state and it's a money train
5212760	5217080	it's back in the day it was in the 70s they monetized talking about race and gender and rape
5217080	5221400	and things like that i'm going to i'm blurs now they sort of were like we want money but we don't
5221400	5226280	want money by alienation so they're they're more likely to turn on a product that is appeasing to
5226280	5231000	all people that doesn't start any controversy in the 70s they were like there's money and controversy
5232120	5236600	i call my girlfriend the n-word constantly but does she act like that
5236600	5251400	did we get the light the lights got brighter because that joke was so great
5254680	5259000	i do want to confess that and i don't know if i'll stop or not i have to look within myself but it's
5259000	5262920	like it's thing i mean we do with my girlfriend and i do so much fucked up shit that we could
5263000	5268760	that i could never share no matter how honest our society got like the things that we say when we
5268760	5274760	have sex the things that we get up to the things that way i i i find that you know what my my
5274760	5279720	relationship with megathy was very public it was a public marriage it was a public divorce it was a
5279720	5284280	public like we were we were pretty transparent about every thought and feeling we had and then
5284280	5289960	with with cody it's like well cody doesn't want to be on a podcast and when we we're like we're
5289960	5298600	private like we we like i i'm starting to appreciate the concept of privacy and i and i
5298600	5305000	and i but i but i want to admit that like yeah i mean it's like it's so i if there was a more
5305000	5309080	horrible word than it than i would call her that when we were talking when i was like like do you
5309080	5318520	want to get a sandwich but you know like and like and i i i i know that words aren't magical but i
5318520	5323320	but i i think the difference is like when you're with the things that we get up to in public when
5323320	5328920	we're talking when we're communicating in public the purpose of language is to share each other's
5328920	5334920	minds and to avoid misunderstanding and so when we have arguments about technical rules about
5334920	5338680	language in public we're kind of defeating the purpose of language which is to be understood
5338680	5343880	and to gain each other's trust like we we and that and that's a that's another thing that i've
5343880	5347640	like that where i used to be a different kind of guy i used to be this whole like
5348520	5352360	if somebody said this word or that word is like should be taken off the menu
5353080	5357480	i would immediately leap to the place if this is a slippery slope and first amendment you have to
5357480	5362680	be able to express yourself but it's like over time hey maybe maybe i get tired and sold out
5362680	5367320	and whatever but i think it's more like well wait a minute we were never talking about legality
5367320	5371720	nobody that ever said that this word offends me ever wanted to actually pass a law keeping you
5371720	5377240	from being able to say anything they're only saying this hurts me and that's their first amendment
5377240	5380680	right and like that's the beautiful thing about language is someone being able to reach out to
5380680	5387720	you and say when you say the word pickle uh my dad hit me with pickles so it causes a reaction
5387720	5394280	to me you don't have to you don't have to be like you piece of shit you nazi fuckface pickle pickle
5394360	5402200	pickle get your hands off my body um it's not it's no one is touching you no one's trying to
5402200	5407480	take your words away they're that's one person and they might not be an expert in telling you
5407480	5412440	they might be a dummy they might be they might be an entitled piece of shit like you know like like
5412440	5417480	maybe they're an unlikable fucking oath that also in addition to that gets hurt when they
5417480	5422600	hear the word pickle maybe they're lying maybe they love the joy of being hurt by things maybe
5422680	5429320	they're just not the but the the larger truth is you can keep saying the word pickle all you want
5429320	5437400	there's a but like oh thank goodness i use that word all the time i'm sorry
5438920	5445800	i interrupt you to train stop go ahead keep going damn keep going keep going let's turn it over to
5445800	5457640	you guys no you don't have to listen to what these pickles have to say anyways yeah well i
5457640	5461880	think i look at that whole thing and i was like i think everybody played it right i mean i don't
5461880	5466600	think i think i think anybody hashtagging fire colbert is kind of dumb i think that's really
5466600	5471000	stupid because like that's not going to solve anything and you're actually not speaking you're
5471000	5476520	not you're not using your i statements you're not saying i think a hashtag like uh i don't you
5476520	5482680	know i'm gay and like that hurts my feelings it's probably too long a hashtag um like somewhere
5482680	5487720	where you're like accountable where you go like i personally i don't like the smell of that and
5487720	5493240	then there's like hashtags are for like solidarity where you go plus i'm not alone check it out um
5493240	5497560	but we have to get over that mob mentality too because there's a lot of people that deserve
5497560	5502040	respect that shouldn't be required to have a million people marching before we give them our
5502040	5512120	respect anyways uh the but but the but like colbert said putin trump sucks on putin's dick
5512120	5516520	and then he did it in the midst of an important fucking tirade about what a piece of shit this
5516520	5521400	horrible criminal president was and and how offensive he was and and and how he's not entitled
5521400	5525000	to his own feelings and he can get up and have a hissy fit whenever he doesn't feel comfortable
5525080	5529720	in an interview because he's a fucking piece of human garbage and and when colbert gets upset and
5529720	5533880	he's his words have power in things and in the midst of that he said like oh he sucks up his dick
5533880	5537640	and then people are like that hurts or that's homophobia and like half of them are conservative
5537640	5543240	or whatever and then colbert's quote-unquote apology was like i used words that were more harsh
5543240	5548280	than maybe they should have been but i would have said i'd say it again i do the thing that i did
5548840	5560040	use the word cockholster right which is hilarious right yeah and it's like we're the trolls now
5560040	5564520	that's the important thing like we're the ones that are disenfranchised and and like one power
5564520	5570120	that we should have is the power to say things that get attention uh i can't talk shit that's
5570120	5574840	not our that's not our thing that's what they do republicans are good at that they're full of hate
5574840	5579960	not all republicans but that side so whenever we try to talk shit back to them yeah we look
5579960	5584600	stupid we keep it self-destructive yeah it's not our thing we're not good at firebombing we're not
5584600	5589240	good at excluding we're not good at being racist and prejudiced so we shouldn't try to do that shit
5589240	5593400	that's what fucked him up is he was trying to play their game we kind of have to remember don't do
5593400	5606840	that we have to figure out some way that has to be like a it has to be some product we can sell
5606840	5614520	on cafe press that's a little brandon a little pickle for white writers it's your angry brandon
5614520	5628040	writing coach that's that's what that's what that's what your your privileged

6170600	6183400	anymore yeah uh let's close the show with an amazing improvised musical thing that i'm
6183400	6186040	very passionate about and totally sober enough to do
6189160	6192920	hit it oh so reluctant
6198520	6199000	yo
6204520	6211320	yo yeah yeah wick wick wicky wicky wicky wicky leaks
6211320	6222360	wicky leaks wicky leaks wicky leaks wicky leaks yo yo yo i'm a gay rapper
6225240	6234760	i'm a gay rapper i have to walk a lot of lines i've gotta be tough but i can't sell out
6234760	6245880	i'm a gay rapper what does that mean what will that mean a gay male rapper i want to get up in
6245880	6252680	the morning with a partner that i love and respect and he's a man but i don't respect him because
6252680	6259400	that's the thing so would a gay rapper be like fuck all these dicks suck all these butts fuck
6259480	6266760	these dudes with all their nuts dudes they're sluts i use them up like coconuts i'm a gay rapper
6268040	6274680	i fuck a million butts don't care about any of the butts because i'm a gay rapper i don't know
6277640	6283560	does that further stereotypes of gay promiscuity as a dean and gayness is it a rapper's job to
6283560	6289720	humanize anything gay rapper g-a-y fucked your butt now i won't tell you why fucked it
6289720	6294600	now i walk away i'm a tough rapper and gay do i have to be tough i don't know
6303720	6304920	it's a good question
6304920	6313720	because you can't be like wake up in the morning cookie of food because i'm in a good mood
6313720	6322040	because i'm gay those curtains gotta go away that's a stereotype yeah that's fucking dumb
6322680	6326440	you don't want to do that so i think i think a real gay rapper would be like
6326440	6339000	my name is mr johnson i don't do a lot out of the ordinary i went to the library today
6340120	6347720	but i didn't read about being gay because i know what that's like it's like getting your bike taken
6347720	6354760	by a motherfucking forsaken sucker mc that tries to take your shit all day you know what that's like
6354760	6360440	i do because i'm a gay rapper i grew up different i'm harder than you because i'm
6360440	6367320	gayer than you that's a gay rapping stance and i also better at dancing that's a stereotype
6368520	6371160	but it's about black people not about gay people
6373080	6377000	is it racist and homophobic to say i'm a gay rapper i dance twice as well
6377000	6385960	that would be a dangerous area so you'd stay out of it you'd say i'm a gay rapper i cut down
6385960	6394520	a tree today i took my shirt off in a non-binary way i i wrung it out i drank a glass of lemonade
