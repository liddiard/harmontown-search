0	9000	Hello, I would like to order a burger please.
9000	13400	Okay, I mean usually you would just say what you wanted like you pulled up to a burger
13400	16960	spot but that's fantastic.
16960	22760	I would like a cheeseburger and soda and some fries.
22760	28880	Got it and those are Carolina hot cake fries or do you want the blisters?
28880	32640	Are the blisters hot cake style?
32640	35760	Yeah, 100% they're blasting, man.
35760	38160	Okay, I'll have those.
38160	39160	Great.
39160	43760	Can I take your order?
43760	46480	Welcome to Denny's.
46480	50520	Is there supposed to be another?
50520	51520	We've been getting interference.
51520	54120	Don't listen to him.
54120	55600	Hey, can I get your order?
55600	56600	Darryl.
56600	57600	It's currently priced.
57600	58600	Darryl.
59320	60320	We've got interference, man.
60320	65480	I mean go ahead and do the order but you're going to have to go across the street.
65480	67720	How come I can hear him?
67720	69640	Why is there two speakers?
69640	77600	Well okay, so we just bombed Syria and so the Russians are responding with a massive
77600	84000	cyber attack and what's happened is they've created an interference wave that's essentially
84000	87880	all the fast food restaurants have mixed up with each other.
87880	93480	So they knew the number one way to hurt America was to fuck up the fast food distribution
93480	94480	chain.
94480	95480	And it's working.
95480	98480	Seven of our customers committed suicide last week.
98480	99480	We're going for eight.
99480	100480	Can I take your order?
100480	101480	I can't.
101480	102480	I can't.
102480	103480	I can't.
103480	104480	You just have to cross the street.
104480	105480	Just cross the street.
105480	106480	No.
106480	109800	Why do I need to go across the street if you're the same restaurant?
109800	113400	If you want to order from me, you can.
113400	115600	I will take your order from you.
115600	120680	But I am in another restaurant three blocks up.
120680	122080	No!
122080	134360	All right, we get we get time and a half.
134360	135520	Yeah, so cool.
135520	136840	Per Suicide.
136840	139760	Thank you, Putin.
139760	142360	It's Harman Town time.
142360	143360	Harman.
143360	144360	Harman Town.
144360	145360	Here we go.
145360	146360	We're zooming.
146360	149360	You got to get off the stage.
149360	151360	Here we go.
151360	177080	Okay, do I start now?
177080	178600	Here we go, friends.
178600	185400	Welcome to the pre-singularity, pre-World War III, Harman Town, presenting your favorite
185400	188400	game master, Rob Schrupp.
188400	201840	And there he is, king of the town, Dan Arman.
201840	204840	Yo, yo, yo, rap-a-dee-rap, rap-a-dee-rap.
205840	209840	Yo, rap-a-dee-rap, rap-a-dee-rap at the top of the show, rap.
209840	212840	Put the music in your heart and your feet.
212840	215840	Fuck your mama until she's red like a beat.
215840	217840	Get the beat on the street.
217840	219840	Make your voice go up a couple matches.
219840	222840	Eat, I'm gonna fuck your mama with my dick.
222840	224840	I'm not doing anything weird.
224840	225840	It's nothing sick.
225840	232840	Just gonna take her out, take her back home, and shout into her pussy like a paper bag.
232840	235840	And then I'll pop it.
235840	236840	All right.
236840	237840	Thank you.
237840	238840	Thank you.
238840	240840	We're still working out the...
240840	242840	I like this new format.
242840	244840	Yeah, we're still working with the format.
244840	245840	This is fantastic.
245840	246840	We could do this every week.
246840	247840	Change nothing.
247840	251840	We opened with the drive-through sketch, a classic.
251840	252840	Classic.
252840	254840	A little updated.
254840	263840	There were some added updates of topical news.
263840	264840	That's right.
264840	265840	Because it's coming.
265840	266840	Yes.
266840	270840	If this is your first episode of Harman Town, you...
270840	272840	Not for me.
272840	274840	You shouldn't...
274840	276840	This isn't like the other episodes.
276840	278840	This is a very special episode.
278840	280840	Our comp-troller is Duncan Trussell.
280840	281840	Thanks for coming.
281840	282840	Hello, everyone.
282840	283840	Thank you.
283840	284840	Good to see you here.
284840	287840	Our gay master is Rob Shaw.
287840	288840	What did you say?
288840	289840	What did you say?
289840	290840	Gay master.
290840	291840	Rob Shaw, the gay master.
291840	292840	You're filling in his gay master.
292840	295840	I think you're missing a consonant.
295840	296840	Nope.
296840	298840	Not at all.
298840	301840	What, are you accusing him of gaslighting?
301840	302840	Yes.
302840	305840	And there's no audience.
305840	309840	You're losing the audience.
310840	313840	I mean, am I allowed to leave the podium and get myself vodka?
313840	314840	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
314840	315840	Absolutely.
315840	316840	Eggs.
316840	321840	Do we have coke or sodas?
321840	323840	Do you have Coke Zero?
323840	328840	Do you have Crystal Pepsi?
328840	331840	Do you have Cherry 7-Up?
331840	333840	I don't know what else we have besides vodka.
333840	335840	What about La Croix?
335840	339840	Will someone please bring Rob a non-alcoholic beverage?
339840	340840	All right, guys.
340840	341840	Here we go.
341840	345840	I just need something sweet.
345840	353840	I wouldn't mind getting through this one kind of quick.
353840	354840	Which one?
354840	355840	The show?
355840	356840	Yeah.
356840	357840	What's wrong?
357840	358840	Why don't you shorten the show?
358840	361840	I got a hot game of Minecraft going at home.
361840	363840	Why don't you shorten the show?
364840	368840	I'm thinking maybe I'll start shortening it by 10 minutes every week
368840	371840	so that no one notices that it's eventually an hour.
371840	373840	Sorry, this is all water.
373840	375840	This is water?
375840	378840	OK, that's kind of like soda.
378840	381840	I got to say, I haven't been here in a while, man.
381840	383840	But we've been tightening the format, yeah.
383840	386840	And this is strange.
386840	390840	This fits in with everything that's happening.
390840	394840	You know, it's like perfectly exactly what's happening.
394840	398840	It's like this kind of fantastic collapse.
398840	400840	Do we have no audience last time you were here?
400840	402840	No, we had an audience.
402840	404840	We had this beautiful, wonderful audience.
404840	409840	And now it's just this empty cavernous space.
409840	411840	It's like the end of it.
411840	413840	This is something I've been thinking about a lot,
413840	418840	is the apocalypse and how the apocalypse is not going to be
418840	421840	the way people think the apocalypse would be.
421840	422840	No big insects.
422840	423840	What's that?
423840	424840	Sorry.
424840	425840	Keep going.
425840	426840	No what sex?
426840	427840	No big insects.
427840	428840	Insects.
428840	430840	No incest in the apocalypse?
430840	431840	Yeah.
431840	434840	No big incest.
434840	437840	No, no, massive incest.
437840	442840	I think it'll be filled with giant insects.
442840	445840	Like giant bees that fuck their cousins?
446840	448840	Yeah.
448840	452840	Most insects are essentially practicing massive incest,
452840	453840	right?
453840	455840	I've never looked into that.
455840	456840	I have no idea.
456840	460840	I suppose every species has some built in exogenous safety
460840	464840	valve, like tries to keep itself from fucking itself.
464840	468840	Yeah, there's probably a safety valve.
469840	475840	So when you leave for Minecraft, Duncan and I will just
475840	477840	we'll mine the store while you go play your game.
477840	479840	Now that sounds like a plan.
479840	480840	Yeah.
480840	485840	We could get a lot of stuff done tonight after he'd go.
485840	486840	Yep.
486840	490840	We'll probably have an audience again soon.
490840	493840	We're going to be moving out of here.
493840	495840	Into my butthole.
495840	499840	I'm evicting us so that the great Tyco ITT can make his
499840	501840	Starburns feature.
501840	503840	I love his trains.
503840	505840	I mean, the format is crazy right now.
505840	506840	I know.
506840	508840	Well, that's why I was doing this.
508840	510840	I'm trying to get it out of the system because I know we're
510840	512840	going to be back in front of an audience soon and then we're
512840	516840	not going to be able to do stuff like fake cold opens and things,
516840	517840	you know?
517840	521840	No, I mean, this is like something I would dream.
521840	524840	I would dream I was doing this with no audience or something
524840	527840	like truly like after the world ends,
527840	529840	a few of us have gone mad.
529840	531840	There's a few people in an old empty warehouse and we're like,
531840	532840	fuck it.
532840	533840	We'll just do a talk show.
533840	535840	We all have beers and we're eating our legs.
535840	536840	Yeah.
536840	540840	Like, I mean, I there's something about like like if it
540840	543840	was like if you walked outside, you would die.
543840	545840	You know, like there's something about still doing the
545840	546840	podcast.
546840	547840	Yeah.
547840	549840	The responsibility of like, look,
549840	551840	people are boarded up in their homes.
551840	552840	Right.
552840	554840	You know, they're eating their legs and growing beards,
554840	557840	but they still this is the only happiness they have.
557840	558840	Oh, my God.
558840	560840	I know I know what this reminds me of because I was just
560840	561840	watching it.
561840	564840	You know, one thing that just infuriated me is I realized
564840	569840	you cannot download the original dawn of the day from normal
569840	570840	meat.
570840	571840	You have to get it off of YouTube.
571840	572840	It's lower.
572840	573840	What are you talking about?
573840	577840	You as far as I'm aware, you can't get it from Amazon.
577840	578840	You can't get it from iTunes.
578840	581840	You can't get it from the normal ways that you would down.
581840	583840	I mean, you could you could torn and I'm sure but like,
583840	586840	you know, the convenience of just downloading it for like
586840	587840	three bucks.
587840	589840	It's for some who knows why.
589840	591840	You know, because they want you to get the new one because it's
591840	594840	all probably same money going to the same place and so they
594840	595840	want.
595840	599840	Well, they just put out a 4K version of Night of the Living
599840	602840	Dead and they're probably doing a new restoration of that.
602840	608840	I just bought coincidentally somebody took like all of the
608840	612840	cuts of the original dawn of the dead because Dario Argento
612840	617840	produced it and there was like more different deleted scenes
617840	618840	in the Italian version.
618840	621840	Someone did a super cut of both of them and I'm going to get
621840	624840	it in the mail this week.
624840	626840	So I've never seen the Italian version of it.
626840	627840	That's bad ass.
627840	629840	It's a different name, wasn't it?
629840	631840	Zombie or something, I think.
631840	632840	Yeah.
632840	634840	But that's one of my favorite movies and it starts off and
634840	635840	it's sorry, Dan.
635840	639840	It starts off on a TV studio during the apocalypse and they're
639840	640840	trying to process it.
640840	644840	And it's very similar to this, except we're like more like low
644840	645840	key.
645840	646840	They're freaking out.
646840	651840	But it is like an abandoned like news state, like the cameras
651840	653840	moving around, people are talking, you know, in the
653840	654840	background.
654840	655840	Yeah.
655840	659840	It does have this kind of, you know, dead, dead has been show
659840	660840	feeling.
660840	666840	The owner of that release, didn't we write a what if we
666840	669840	were Dawn of the Dead sketch?
669840	670840	Yeah.
670840	672840	So I don't know why you guys are spoiling it so much.
672840	673840	Okay.
673840	676840	I mean, I said we should segue to this topic to tee up our
676840	678840	Dawn of the Dead sketch that we've been spending so much
678840	679840	time on.
679840	681840	We had our meeting about the show yesterday.
681840	682840	Yeah, when we wrote the burger sketch.
682840	683840	Right.
683840	686840	It took a long, a team of 15 writers.
686840	687840	Yeah.
687840	688840	Yeah.
688840	689840	Well, yeah.
689840	692840	So let's let's let's let's start that sketch.
692840	696840	This is the Dawn of the Dead sketch.
696840	700840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
700840	702840	They're coming for you.
702840	703840	They're coming.
703840	704840	It's funnier every time.
704840	707840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
707840	710840	Last week on Night of the Living Dead.
710840	715840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
716840	718840	They're coming for you.
718840	722840	They've been dead a long time, Barbara.
722840	725840	They're coming for you.
725840	729840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
729840	733840	You know, man, when I was watching my friend in his
733840	737840	throat ripped out by a zombie before I ran in here.
737840	738840	Yes, Barbara.
738840	740840	I thought to myself, I'd never laugh again.
740840	741840	Like I would go into shock.
741840	742840	I'd go nuts.
742840	746840	But that fucking thing, man, every time you keep doing that
746840	750840	impression from Night of the Living Dead is fucking funny.
750840	751840	It's a good one, Bob.
751840	755840	How did you first learn how funny that was?
755840	758840	Oh, the first time I said it, Barbara.
758840	760840	I love it.
760840	765840	And Barbara laughed.
765840	767840	And then you also laughed, Barbara.
767840	769840	Can I be clear on something?
770840	773840	You're saying that he's doing it from the movie
773840	774840	Night of the Living Dead.
774840	775840	Yes.
775840	779840	He's doing the impression, ironically, because I slipped
779840	781840	on intestines on the way in here.
781840	783840	You did, Barbara.
783840	784840	All right.
784840	787840	I just want to be clear because that's sometimes a thing like
787840	790840	Night of the Living Dead is a movie that we can rent.
790840	794840	And End of the Thing defines the thing, Barbara.
794840	798840	So they're coming to get you, Barbara.
798840	799840	Here we are.
799840	801840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
801840	804840	I've been saying that all night.
804840	806840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
806840	807840	Oh, shit.
807840	808840	Shit.
808840	809840	Sorry.
809840	810840	We're live again.
810840	811840	They're coming.
811840	812840	All right.
812840	819840	If you are in the Glenbrook area, Reseda, Riverside,
819840	821840	we have a new list of shelters for you.
821840	822840	Riverside?
822840	825840	Do not go to the schools.
825840	827840	Do not go to the shelters.
827840	831840	We've mentioned in the previous segment, those shelters have been
831840	834840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
834840	836840	Seriously, my mom lives in Riverside.
836840	837840	If you are just tuning in.
837840	838840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
838840	839840	Guys, we're live.
839840	840840	This is live.
840840	841840	It's not funny.
841840	842840	My mom.
842840	843840	The dead have been returning to life.
843840	845840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
845840	846840	And murdering the living.
846840	848840	They're coming to get you, Barbara.
848840	850840	I left the door open.
850840	851840	It's okay.
851840	853840	It doesn't.
853840	856840	It's okay.
856840	858840	Laughter gets through.
858840	860840	Laughter gets through this.
860840	864840	We have a doctor here, a physiologist in the studio.
864840	867840	His name was Finch Williams.
867840	870840	I was my brother.
870840	873840	They were eating his throat.
873840	875840	I guess he's no longer with us.
875840	876840	Okay.
876840	884840	Again, if someone near you has perished, do not leave the body unattended.
884840	886840	Do not attempt to bury it.
886840	887840	Burn it.
887840	888840	Or cut off the head.
888840	890840	Or drive a sharp object.
890840	892840	Don't do any of that?
892840	893840	No, don't.
893840	894840	Oh, sorry.
894840	896840	Don't bury the body.
896840	897840	Don't just hang out with it.
897840	899840	Don't sit, Shiva.
899840	901840	I think that's what they call it.
901840	904840	Well, you could try to make it laugh.
904840	908840	You could go, they're coming to get you, Barbara.
908840	909840	It's not funny anymore.
909840	910840	If I was going to make a zombie laugh, I wouldn't.
910840	911840	It's funny.
911840	912840	It's not.
912840	913840	My mom's probably dead right now.
913840	914840	It's my fault.
914840	918840	Well, I mean, the question is, like, is she really dead if she comes back to life?
918840	919840	Your mom's immortal now.
919840	920840	That's not...
920840	924840	Your mom's, like, immortally retarded?
924840	925840	Is that what a zombie...
925840	929840	Last thing I said to her is, I hope they fucking get you.
929840	931840	It's just your mom's going to live forever.
931840	932840	You should be happy.
932840	933840	Oh, shit.
933840	934840	You know what?
934840	940840	We're going to take a brief break from the broadcast because I left my keys in the helicopter
940840	945840	on the roof, and I'm just going to run up there, go in the helicopter, grab my keys,
945840	952840	and come back down to hang out here with everybody, all these funny people, and keep helping people
952840	953840	by...
953840	955840	I'm so glad we have that helicopter.
955840	956840	Me too.
956840	959840	If there was ever a reason to have a...
959840	962840	That's for sure.
962840	964840	Did you hear something?
964840	965840	Yeah, I heard it.
965840	966840	What did you hear?
966840	969840	I heard a bird flapping really fast.
969840	972840	Yeah, it sounded like a giant hummingbird.
972840	978840	Or helicopter?
978840	980840	And scene.
980840	981840	Oh, man.
981840	983840	I thought we were going to say helicopter together.
983840	984840	Yeah.
984840	986840	We didn't.
986840	987840	Yeah.
987840	988840	I mean, it's good.
988840	993840	So, Dawn of the Dead's probably coming out on DVD or something, and so we threw that together.
993840	995840	Yeah, on DVD.
995840	996840	DVD, it'll come out.
996840	998840	We have some other sketches coming out throughout the show.
998840	999840	King Kong Lives.
999840	1001840	Try to get your mind off the Trump thing.
1001840	1005840	We're not doing a lot of current event sketches, but we do...
1005840	1009840	We got to do a couple, otherwise we're going to lose listeners to MSNBC.
1009840	1010840	That's true.
1010840	1013840	We try to keep it above the belt.
1013840	1015840	We try to keep it...
1015840	1018840	We try to keep it above the belt.
1018840	1020840	This is wild, man.
1020840	1021840	Last time I was here...
1021840	1022840	There were people laughing.
1022840	1024840	Filled with people laughing.
1024840	1025840	No bad...
1025840	1027840	Do you know why they stopped?
1027840	1028840	Do you know why they stopped coming?
1028840	1029840	Yeah, I heard...
1029840	1030840	Quality.
1030840	1031840	Yeah, I heard the quality.
1031840	1032840	Yeah, we actually...
1032840	1035840	We dropped our tickets to a penny.
1035840	1037840	People just aren't coming.
1037840	1038840	They just...
1038840	1039840	What happened?
1039840	1040840	It just slid downhill.
1040840	1041840	Yeah.
1041840	1042840	What happened?
1042840	1044840	I started showing up regularly.
1044840	1045840	I don't...
1045840	1046840	Was it you?
1046840	1049840	I remember you spiraled into some deep, dark existentialism.
1049840	1051840	Yeah, that's always good.
1051840	1055840	When you incurred the wrath of the gods is what happened.
1055840	1057840	Do you worry about that?
1057840	1063840	That the reason that the fire department came and shut down Harmontown and that the chaos
1063840	1066840	is coming from a vortex of that dark...
1066840	1067840	Remember that?
1067840	1069840	I don't know if you're still in it, that thing you went into.
1069840	1073840	Do you worry that it's like law of attraction stuff?
1073840	1075840	I'm on the rim.
1075840	1076840	Yeah, I mean, I'm sure...
1076840	1079840	I believe that stuff like that is related.
1080840	1084840	You get dark enough and the universe around you starts reflecting that darkness.
1084840	1087840	What do you think about, you bring about?
1089840	1092840	Yeah, but I don't see the merit in...
1092840	1093840	I mean, I'm trying...
1093840	1095840	It's not that I don't see the merit in it.
1095840	1096840	It's just that I...
1096840	1098840	It's just hard to...
1098840	1103840	I don't want to disingenuously be happy.
1103840	1104840	No.
1104840	1105840	I don't want to force it.
1105840	1106840	No way.
1106840	1110840	You know, those people that say it takes less muscles to smile and they got to think positive
1110840	1111840	and stuff.
1111840	1112840	It's just like...
1112840	1115840	What I like to do is be happy.
1115840	1118840	I had it out with my therapist Friday.
1118840	1119840	Let her have it.
1119840	1126840	Because it was a pretty interesting session because it was pretty...
1126840	1128840	She made it pretty clear.
1128840	1130840	I do have...
1130840	1133840	My big thing is shame.
1133840	1137840	And the shame doesn't really let me...
1137840	1140840	You know, it just sort of dominates everything.
1140840	1141840	There's a lot of people.
1141840	1142840	I got to try to...
1142840	1147840	The next five years is going to be about replacing the shame with esteem.
1147840	1151840	You know, this thing Terrence McKenna said I always think about is that...
1151840	1154840	Because, you know, the happy idea are supposed to be happy.
1154840	1157840	Terrence McKenna was saying this thing about how...
1157840	1160840	He was talking about something called shamanic ecstasy.
1160840	1165840	Like, ecstatic states are not limited to happiness or joy states.
1165840	1172840	But there's ecstatic sadness, ecstatic shame, ecstatic misery.
1172840	1177840	And I really like that because it's not an invitation to, like, oh, just be happy.
1177840	1183840	It's more of an invitation to, like, fully be what you are right now, as deep as you can be,
1183840	1185840	which is what you do.
1185840	1193840	And even if that thing produces a wave of some kind of psychic repulsion
1193840	1198840	that produces dark ripples that make the fire department shut down this beautiful fucking theater
1198840	1201840	and transforms everything into a reflection of the darkness,
1201840	1205840	even that's kind of amazing because it's like, holy shit, magic's real.
1205840	1207840	I was looking at it more like...
1207840	1209840	The funny thing is, as much shame as I have,
1209840	1212840	I didn't really think to blame myself for the fire marshal.
1212840	1214840	I was actually thinking the fire marshal was paling me out.
1214840	1217840	Like, that that was God, like, saving me.
1217840	1220840	Because I was really... because I was starting to hate the audience.
1220840	1222840	And I mostly hate myself.
1222840	1224840	I mean, you can't really hate an audience.
1224840	1225840	An audience is always...
1225840	1228840	Are you afraid... are you afraid you're going to hate the audience again when they start crying?
1228840	1229840	No, no, no.
1229840	1231840	It's like a rom-com, you know?
1231840	1232840	We broke up.
1232840	1233840	We spent all this time apart.
1233840	1235840	Now I've got long hair.
1235840	1236840	Why'd you hate him?
1236840	1238840	I hated... I just hated...
1238840	1240840	I hated what we were all going through together, you know?
1240840	1242840	So it was just brought out the worst in all of us.
1242840	1244840	You know, I just speak for myself.
1244840	1248840	It just made me... I was just really sad and all this stuff.
1248840	1253840	So it's like, I'm not going to have a good relationship with the audience.
1253840	1255840	I was just like...
1255840	1260840	They're a giant crowd of people that react on certain cues.
1260840	1261840	And like, that was exactly...
1261840	1263840	You know, I wasn't in the mood for that.
1263840	1266840	We were all feeling kind of, like, really frightened
1266840	1270840	about these concepts of, like, crowd dynamics and stuff.
1270840	1273840	Like, you know, what makes people go,
1273840	1277840	ooh, or what makes people go boo, or yay, or...
1277840	1278840	It just kind of...
1278840	1281840	There was no good news to any of it.
1281840	1284840	It was like, I would come out on stage and I would...
1284840	1286840	I don't ever think about it that much,
1286840	1290840	but it was just like, my micro flowchart would be...
1290840	1293840	If you slowed it down, would be something like,
1293840	1295840	okay, so what am I supposed to do?
1295840	1299840	Ignore how much peril is...
1299840	1302840	I feel how much sadness, how much frustration,
1302840	1305840	how much humiliation, how much shame, how much rage.
1305840	1308840	Do I ignore those things?
1308840	1310840	And then become like a kind of...
1310840	1313840	I don't know, like a Regis Philbin character?
1313840	1316840	Do I become, like...
1319840	1320840	Sean King?
1320840	1324840	Do I become a voice of a generation?
1324840	1326840	That sounds like a lot of work.
1326840	1327840	And not my generation.
1327840	1329840	Do I actually have to...
1329840	1333840	It's like an experiment with signal boosting young activists
1333840	1336840	and stuff, like, okay, let's use this platform
1336840	1339840	because it just doesn't feel right to sit around
1339840	1343840	and talk about how I don't want to tie my shoes anymore.
1343840	1346840	I was just thinking as you're doing this...
1346840	1350840	You know, obviously, Jonestown's pretty sad.
1350840	1353840	But it's kind of like there's at least one little happy part of it,
1353840	1357840	which is that Jim Jones killed himself, too.
1357840	1359840	But think how fucked up it would have been
1359840	1362840	if they walked in there and he's still talking
1362840	1366840	and there's all those fucking dead bodies just surrounding him,
1366840	1369840	but he's giving a sermon to the dead bodies.
1369840	1372840	Damn, that would have been amazing.
1372840	1374840	He just didn't have the guts.
1376840	1379840	You watched this Wild Wild Country?
1379840	1380840	Yes, I did, yeah.
1380840	1382840	Your opinion?
1383840	1385840	I thought it was beautiful.
1385840	1387840	Like, the way they edited it and put it...
1387840	1390840	I thought it was beautiful, but I wish they'd focused more on Osho
1390840	1394840	because I think that what I love about a good cult documentary
1394840	1397840	is if they put in enough of the cult leader's philosophy
1397840	1399840	that it makes me want to join.
1399840	1400840	Right.
1400840	1404840	But not to be one of the people that responds this way to that,
1404840	1410840	but I noticed the same thing but felt that that was the point.
1410840	1412840	Then that was what made it really cool,
1412840	1416840	was that they actually just focused entirely on the relationship
1416840	1421840	between the cult and the townspeople to the point where
1421840	1424840	if you were an alien, you wouldn't know what a cult was
1424840	1427840	and you spent the whole time going like,
1427840	1431840	well, why aren't they a cult, these hillbillies that are so smug
1431840	1432840	and have their...
1432840	1435840	They keep talking about how they have their own way of doing things.
1436840	1441840	And I loved how you would love them and hate them
1441840	1444840	up and down and up and all around.
1444840	1448840	And I think that they just very tastefully inserted
1448840	1454840	from the rednecks perspective toward the beginning
1454840	1457840	that movie that comes out that everyone gets to see
1457840	1462840	their naked primal scream therapy or whatever.
1462840	1470840	But it was like, didn't it feel like if they had focused in
1470840	1474840	on this guy who didn't talk for four years
1474840	1477840	and stuff like what that religion was,
1477840	1479840	that it would invite all of your...
1479840	1481840	It would just put you in the shoes of the redneck
1481840	1484840	or the shoes of the convert, like you're saying.
1484840	1487840	I keep thinking kind of what you're saying.
1487840	1489840	I guess it must have been intentional.
1489840	1496840	The thing that happens where the gatekeeper
1496840	1499840	becomes the destination, sort of.
1499840	1501840	They're showing the gross thing.
1501840	1503840	Everyone focuses on the pope.
1503840	1507840	It's like everyone focuses on the representative of the thing
1507840	1508840	instead of the thing itself.
1508840	1510840	And maybe they wanted to make a point of doing that
1510840	1512840	without saying that's what they were doing.
1512840	1515840	It was good in the sense that it elicits all of these thoughts
1515840	1517840	and makes you wonder.
1517840	1519840	Maybe I'm just looking for a different documentary,
1519840	1522840	but I could easily just do the research and read Osho stuff.
1522840	1525840	Yeah, and he's pretty fun.
1525840	1531840	Cody was a lover of his quotes and stuff.
1531840	1533840	What are some of his quotes?
1533840	1534840	I don't know.
1534840	1539840	He was a fun guy because he had that look,
1539840	1544840	but he would just talk very liberally about sex and stuff.
1545840	1548840	But yeah, I mean, I found myself, too.
1548840	1551840	I was like, wait, pump the brakes and let me get out
1551840	1553840	and smell the roses here.
1553840	1557840	These people just started carrying assault rifles
1557840	1559840	and dressing like the Joker and stuff like that.
1559840	1563840	All these people with their ties and their clean-cut beards
1563840	1567840	and like, what is this cult?
1567840	1570840	But I think it was good that it was just like,
1570840	1572840	I felt in the end, I was weeping at the end
1573840	1576840	because I felt like I had been thrust into the position of God
1576840	1580840	by both these rednecks and these cultists
1580840	1583840	and everybody had just swirled around
1583840	1589840	in this tidy ball of conflict and chasing each other
1589840	1591840	and that the whole thing was just...
1591840	1593840	I just started crying.
1593840	1596840	Thank God for that guy, the guy that kind of takes you through
1596840	1598840	the whole thing, the lawyer,
1598840	1600840	and then he's just walking with his cane.
1600840	1602840	I just started bawling my eyes out.
1602840	1604840	I think he's just so...
1604840	1608840	It was like he didn't do anything wrong that entire time.
1608840	1610840	He was a reliable narrator
1610840	1615840	and he was neither a Sheila loyalist
1615840	1620840	nor a trying to abscond with Osho.
1620840	1623840	I mean, he represented that kind of...
1623840	1625840	Like when you read Going Clear,
1625840	1627840	those Scientologists that are just sort of like,
1627840	1629840	look, I'm getting something out of this.
1629840	1632840	Can we stop with the drama?
1632840	1636840	And that he was a sort of life master.
1636840	1639840	He represented the best that that quote-unquote cult
1639840	1642840	could accomplish, I think, that the reason for its existence
1642840	1646840	was that it made you an effective, happy person that drew people.
1646840	1647840	It still goes on, you know.
1647840	1650840	You didn't have to leave capitalism behind.
1650840	1653840	You didn't have to have all these extreme conversations
1653840	1655840	about like, this world is bullshit.
1655840	1658840	They just fucking built a city in the middle of nowhere.
1658840	1660840	And then I guess what made me start crying
1660840	1662840	was that you could do all that.
1662840	1667840	You could ride that wave without falling off the surfboard
1667840	1672840	like he did, and then it still just ends with you
1672840	1674840	with a gray beard walking around.
1674840	1676840	You can't surf forever.
1676840	1677840	You can't...
1677840	1679840	Well, I mean, it does happen,
1679840	1683840	but for that thing to happen, it takes war.
1683840	1684840	I mean, historically.
1684840	1687840	If you look at it, it's like to get the big paradigm shift
1687840	1690840	to happen in a serious way.
1690840	1692840	You know, pulled it off the Mormons.
1692840	1695840	Like, there was conflict with them.
1695840	1697840	They fought them for a while.
1697840	1700840	When a thing like that, when a theocracy bubbles up
1700840	1703840	or a new idea bubbles up, quite often,
1703840	1706840	it seems like the idea it bubbles up inside of
1706840	1711840	tries to kill it, especially if it's a contagious idea.
1711840	1712840	They try to...
1712840	1714840	If it's like a threat to the dominant paradigm
1714840	1717840	and it gets big enough, the helicopters show up,
1717840	1721840	the cops show up, the fire marshal shows up.
1721840	1723840	Yeah, yeah.
1723840	1726840	There's a fantastic, like, closing thought
1726840	1729840	at the end of that Going Clear book
1729840	1734840	that just, yeah, sort of without bothering
1734840	1737840	to categorize Scientology as either a good thing
1737840	1740840	or a bad thing, just talking about the history
1740840	1748840	of upstart religion in the United States
1748840	1752840	and how, yeah, we want to look at all of these things
1752840	1755840	and go, they either need to live or die,
1755840	1758840	but we coexist with things like Mormonism
1758840	1763840	or Jehovah's Witness re, whatever you call it
1763840	1765840	in its noun form.
1765840	1769840	But it's like, yeah, these little things,
1769840	1771840	they're not called cults anymore.
1771840	1773840	You could call Mormonism a cult if you wanted to,
1773840	1777840	but we don't anymore because we, yeah, we went to,
1777840	1779840	like you said, we jumped them in.
1779840	1781840	What's up with the Pope now?
1781840	1784840	The Pope's saying that hell doesn't exist?
1784840	1787840	Excuse me, can I make a bunch of fucking chair sounds
1787840	1789840	now that you're talking?
1789840	1791840	The fuck were you doing over here?
1791840	1793840	Trying to make a goddamn place.
1793840	1795840	You were talking for a while.
1795840	1797840	I felt like I was supposed to get comfortable.
1797840	1799840	Bookcase, what the fuck is going on?
1799840	1801840	I'm trying to relax here.
1801840	1803840	You're talking forever.
1803840	1805840	You're not even turning or including me.
1805840	1807840	You're all in love with Duncan again.
1807840	1809840	You don't even look at me.
1809840	1811840	What do you mean again?
1811840	1813840	I'm trying to get comfortable.
1813840	1815840	You fell out of love with me.
1815840	1817840	You fell out of love with me.
1817840	1819840	Make it a bookcase.
1819840	1823840	Dan, you noticed those, I didn't notice those chair sounds.
1823840	1825840	I didn't either.
1825840	1826840	Yeah, I did.
1826840	1827840	Oh, you did?
1827840	1829840	Yeah, I know you were doing them.
1829840	1831840	You're like on the fucking vowels of my words.
1831840	1833840	You're like a monkey.
1833840	1835840	You're a naughty monkey.
1835840	1839840	Well, don't invite me anymore and you'll be the happiest person in the world.
1839840	1842840	Please, please, please do the show.
1842840	1844840	Spencer's not going to be here tonight.
1844840	1845840	Davis isn't going to be.
1845840	1847840	Would you please, please?
1847840	1849840	Everybody loves you.
1849840	1850840	Come on, please.
1850840	1852840	That conversation never happened.
1852840	1853840	He's making this up.
1853840	1856840	No, I walked to the door and I found out Spencer wasn't here.
1856840	1857840	Jeff wasn't here.
1857840	1860840	Dan, Dan, I'm just going to read the text you sent me.
1860840	1861840	I know.
1861840	1862840	This is a text from Dan.
1862840	1865840	Please, please, please, please, please.
1865840	1866840	Will you please?
1866840	1868840	Pretty, please, please do the show.
1868840	1869840	Spencer isn't going to be here.
1869840	1871840	Will you please, please?
1871840	1874840	Please, please, please, please.
1874840	1875840	Come on, come on, come on.
1875840	1876840	Please, please.
1876840	1877840	Everyone loves you.
1877840	1879840	Please, please.
1879840	1880840	Come on.
1880840	1881840	You guys, look.
1881840	1883840	MC gun control.
1883840	1884840	What's this?
1884840	1887840	Yo.
1887840	1890840	Yo, it's me, MC gun control.
1890840	1893840	I'm a repeat character.
1893840	1894840	Well, now you are.
1894840	1896840	This is the second time you showed up.
1896840	1897840	Give me a beat.
1897840	1901840	I'm going to rap about gun control.
1901840	1903840	Yo, gun control.
1903840	1906840	MC gun control.
1906840	1909840	A lot of guns.
1909840	1912840	Awareness of guns.
1912840	1914840	Gun control.
1914840	1917840	Awareness.
1917840	1922840	A lot of lethal weapons in the world.
1922840	1926840	The AR-15 can kill 30 people per second.
1926840	1932840	It's a very, very expensive military-grade weapon.
1932840	1939840	MC gun control.
1939840	1940840	All right.
1940840	1941840	OK.
1941840	1942840	Got it.
1942840	1945840	So anyway, the pope says that hell doesn't exist?
1945840	1950840	I think it's weird, because the pope said hell doesn't exist.
1950840	1951840	So I heard right.
1951840	1952840	Didn't he?
1952840	1955840	No, but it was like a misquote or something.
1955840	1957840	He's walking it back.
1957840	1959840	He tried to walk it back.
1959840	1960840	I don't know, though.
1960840	1963840	It's one of those things that pops up on the drudge report.
1963840	1966840	That's the thing that gets hit.
1966840	1972840	I think it was either a misquote or it was taken out of context or something.
1972840	1980840	But the thing is, eventually they will say that, right?
1980840	1983840	The drudge report?
1983840	1988840	No, because for hundreds of years,
1988840	1993840	they were holding the line on whether the sun went around the earth or not.
1993840	1998840	I think the important question for us all to ask is, does hell exist?
1998840	1999840	OK.
1999840	2000840	Let's break it down.
2000840	2001840	OK.
2001840	2002840	All right.
2002840	2004840	So no.
2004840	2006840	How do you know?
2006840	2008840	I guess I don't.
2008840	2011840	I don't have any proof about that.
2011840	2015840	Well, their version of hell might not exist.
2015840	2020840	But one of the creepy things about black holes, we don't know what the fuck is going on in there.
2020840	2021840	Yeah.
2021840	2023840	And those things are sucking in galaxies.
2023840	2024840	Yeah.
2024840	2031840	And those galaxies, if there is a soul, does your soul leave the galaxy or does it float around the galaxy?
2031840	2033840	Or does it go to multiple galaxies?
2033840	2035840	Could a soul get sucked into a black hole?
2035840	2042840	My point is, is there some point of maximum soul compression where you would be sentient,
2042840	2045840	but eternally in some infinite blackness?
2045840	2055840	I think because your soul doesn't have mass, it's not accountable to the laws of speed of light and time.
2055840	2062840	So your soul, if there is such a thing, if your consciousness is a field that exists independently
2062840	2068840	of your organ that kind of is representing it corporeally, then upon death,
2068840	2075840	it's possible that your soul will experience infinity because time stops being in time.
2075840	2083840	And then it's possible that that's not like a fun thing for a soul, that that's like being locked in a box
2083840	2085840	because that's why the universe started.
2085840	2092840	It's because God, which was all of us, and everything was like locked in nothingness at no time
2092840	2097840	and was like, I got to get out of here, which is what you do when you're a kid and your brother puts you in a cupboard.
2097840	2100840	You experience the same panic, whereas a rabbit would just hang out.
2100840	2102840	It would just go, I guess I'm locked in a cabinet.
2102840	2107840	But sentience makes you claustrophobic because you go, I can't just be nothing.
2107840	2109840	And you freak the fuck out.
2109840	2112840	And then you start thinking about everything.
2112840	2114840	And then you're like, get me out of here.
2114840	2115840	You throw a tantrum.
2115840	2125840	And that's your piece of the Big Bang, which means possibly when you die, hell may be the only thing that happens,
2125840	2129840	which is simply you returning to the state of the universe before it existed.
2129840	2136840	But with that one little thing of you want to be, but you can't.
2136840	2139840	Osho, that's directly quoted from Osho.
2139840	2140840	Really?
2140840	2142840	That's part of it.
2142840	2145840	And then the other part of it is hell certainly exists on planet Earth.
2145840	2154840	I mean, people become their own black holes and they get so compressed into themselves that every breath is a living hell.
2154840	2157840	So that happens, too.
2157840	2164840	So when the pope says hell doesn't exist, it's like a time when I think I kind of disagreed with the pope.
2164840	2171840	I mean, maybe if he meant it, it's like, well, you must mean like the fire pit thing, probably.
2171840	2176840	But certainly people suffer so deeply on this planet.
2176840	2183840	It'd be cool if he said, sorry, I meant hell doesn't exist underneath the Earth when you die.
2183840	2189840	I meant hell exists on Earth and I know where it is and we have to go fight them.
2189840	2195840	And then he let us and the fucking Lord of the Rings score started.
2195840	2197840	What a great war.
2197840	2201840	That would be so cool to be part of just a war on hell.
2201840	2204840	Do you not happy we beat airstrikes against hell?
2204840	2206840	It would be cool right up until the fighting part.
2206840	2208840	Like it would be fun just walking there, right?
2208840	2212840	Like you were walking part of a big line because the worst case scenario is you'd get tired and be left behind.
2212840	2214840	Big deal.
2214840	2217840	You'd be like, whoops, because I won't make that war we're headed to.
2217840	2221840	But in the meantime, you'd feel like, you know, I always wanted to be like a migrant bird.
2221840	2223840	Like you're just like, you'd have that togetherness.
2223840	2224840	You'd be part of a big caravan.
2224840	2225840	Hey, where are you guys going?
2225840	2229840	We're walking to hell and we're going to fight all the bookends.
2229840	2234840	And then you just walk and you got your knapsack and your marshmallows and your sword.
2234840	2239840	You're wanting to be a migrant bird?
2239840	2243840	Like, dare to dream, man.
2243840	2246840	I wanted to be a firefighter.
2246840	2248840	A migrant bird.
2248840	2249840	Well, it's cool.
2249840	2252840	Danny, what are you going to be when you grow up?
2252840	2255840	Oh, I would like to be a migrant bird.
2255840	2259840	I mean, it's like, yeah, not a migrating bird, but like the.
2259840	2262840	Yeah, like a like an illegal.
2262840	2265840	A migrant bird.
2265840	2267840	It's like doesn't have its visa.
2267840	2269840	A bird, a bird that they make.
2269840	2270840	Yeah.
2270840	2276840	Pick up other birds eggs because the economy of its own bird country is fucked up.
2276840	2281840	Can you imagine if Trump went that nuts that he started trying to keep Mexican birds out
2281840	2283840	of the United States?
2283840	2284840	That'd be incredible.
2284840	2285840	We got.
2285840	2290840	But yeah, I mean, like that's that's always, you know, in this we bomb people and it's
2290840	2292840	all so confusing and ultimately sad.
2292840	2296840	You just think like, man, it would be so nice if if we had some something real to fight.
2296840	2301840	Like we've got all these great weapons and nothing's black, black or white.
2301840	2303840	And it's always so confusing.
2303840	2305840	How glorious would it be, man?
2305840	2309840	Just if Trump came out and he's like, we have found the gateway to hell.
2309840	2310840	Yeah.
2310840	2311840	Here's the videotape of it.
2311840	2312840	Look.
2312840	2315840	And him peeing on a prostitute mattress.
2315840	2321840	That's why the thing is all screwed up.
2321840	2322840	You didn't get the facts right.
2322840	2324840	He's like, there's no pizza for the longest time.
2324840	2328840	And then he's like, look, do you ever think finally they got the P tape and he's like,
2328840	2334840	listen, don't I'm telling you while I was making those hookers pee a gate to hell opened.
2334840	2335840	It was part of a ritual.
2335840	2337340	That's why I didn't want you to see it.
2337340	2339840	I'm proud of making people pee on the Obama's bed.
2339840	2342840	As most of you suspected, that's not a deal breaker for me.
2342840	2344840	I'm a Nazi and a rapist.
2344840	2346840	I don't care what you think of me.
2346840	2353840	I do care if hell overtakes the earth and on that P tape is the gateway to hell.
2353840	2358840	And then Rachel Maddow is like, nice try clown.
2358840	2363840	And then she presses play and then it's like, oh, but it's like fun because it's like,
2363840	2371840	yeah, there's like there's like bad guys that are just like made of shit and they got horns
2371840	2377840	and yeah, you know, and they're like, and then like you could you could fight them like
2377840	2379840	with your friends.
2379840	2381840	You could fight them as part of the army.
2381840	2383840	Like, what are you doing, man?
2383840	2385840	We should people are down the street.
2385840	2386840	Yeah, I'm over.
2386840	2389840	They have like you could choose if you wanted to be like a guerrilla fighter like street
2389840	2393840	to street or just like hang out with your friends and like like because it's like it's
2393840	2395840	just it's just reality versus hell.
2395840	2396840	So it's like not.
2396840	2402840	Yeah, there's an army version, but and that's it's it's for people who who enjoy that kind
2402840	2403840	of thing.
2403840	2406840	Well, that's that's one of the satanic aspects of war, isn't it?
2406840	2413840	It's like it takes exactly what people want to do, which is to build stuff together and
2413840	2419840	like and blow things up and set things on fire and have fun together and like and survive
2419840	2420840	together.
2420840	2426840	And then it takes that thing and transforms it into like a bond.
2426840	2431840	Nothing is more bonding than being like going out in a stressful situation with your pals.
2431840	2432840	People want to have a mission.
2432840	2433840	They like going camping.
2433840	2434840	They like building things.
2434840	2438840	Yeah, I don't feel like camping.
2438840	2439840	Ask me again.
2439840	2440840	Do you like camping?
2440840	2441840	No.
2441840	2442840	You went on a bad camping trip.
2442840	2443840	What?
2443840	2444840	You just went on a few bad camping trips.
2444840	2445840	All of them.
2445840	2446840	I don't.
2446840	2447840	Why would how many camping trips are you going on?
2447840	2450840	I don't remember because I try to block them out.
2450840	2451840	Come on.
2451840	2452840	You can remember.
2452840	2453840	That's ridiculous.
2453840	2454840	How many camping trips you get.
2454840	2456840	You got to think back like you with it under 10 or over 10.
2456840	2457840	Under 10.
2457840	2459840	See, you went on some bad trips.
2459840	2460840	Yeah.
2460840	2463840	And they were all with your parents and you were 10 and you were all right.
2463840	2465840	Let's go on a camping trip.
2465840	2466840	That would be fun.
2466840	2469840	That's the next version of harm in town.
2469840	2471840	Deep in the fucking forest.
2471840	2473840	Just Dan and me.
2473840	2474840	Hunting.
2474840	2475840	No hunting.
2475840	2476840	I don't hunt.
2476840	2481840	The irony should be that we should dress the set for like a camping site like in a sitcom.
2481840	2483840	And then we hit try to have like a campfire.
2483840	2486840	And then the ultimate irony is because the fire marshal shut us down.
2486840	2490840	The whole fucking stage goes up in flames.
2490840	2494840	Do you think that there would be at least a couple of like happy firemen like they would
2494840	2499840	like there would be like a sense of like I told you as they're dragging your charred corpse
2499840	2500840	out.
2500840	2502840	They're like we tried to save you.
2502840	2503840	But they tried.
2503840	2504840	I mean they saved us from the audience.
2504840	2506840	I mean the audience didn't start us on fire.
2506840	2509840	I mean really if like you knew that you were in a simulator.
2509840	2510840	You're going to live forever.
2510840	2512840	You get to repeat everything.
2512840	2519840	Wouldn't in one of those versions the last harm in town be you self emulating.
2519840	2520840	I don't know.
2520840	2523400	I think it would have to be at least one.
2523400	2524400	Oh God.
2524400	2526560	I mean that would be incredible.
2526560	2527560	That could save the world.
2527560	2535200	I'd have to have to have massive guarantees about you know that not being the end and
2535200	2539280	also like like ouch regardless.
2539280	2543040	I mean there's morphine there's ways we could prop your body up make it seem like you're
2543040	2544040	awake.
2544040	2545680	True.
2545680	2547600	Use some kind of scarce crow.
2547600	2549440	You got you run a studio man.
2549440	2554200	There's got to be a way to like get the props to hold you up tight go to animate that get
2554200	2560560	tight go to animate that you get you animate the flames on you with Tyco.
2560560	2568520	You can do it him in bubbles and tight tycos animating bubbles he can animate you em emulating
2568520	2575360	yourself or I don't know man I mean I'm I'm not suggesting self emulation but like if
2575360	2582480	you think in terms of like badass ends of podcasts or series that would be really smart
2582480	2584240	that'll spread all around the world.
2584240	2585240	Yeah.
2585240	2589280	You know it'd be cool is that in the comment section underneath the YouTube video you'd
2589280	2596080	be five comments in before someone commented.
2596080	2602160	Looks like we need to legislate fire control and then the whole thing would just turn into
2602160	2604960	people arguing about guns.
2604960	2609760	After my fucking burning burning death on YouTube like immediately just like every YouTube
2609760	2614760	video I was like oh it's a girl that balance a spoon on her nose and then five five comments
2614760	2621720	down somebody goes like hmm maybe that spoon should be given to Syria and then yes like
2621720	2626120	and then everyone just like like what are comment sections for anyways no that that's
2626120	2630280	the that's one of the things people are worried about with A.I. is it just going to like eternally
2630280	2634080	destroy going to get rid of the comment section just get to there it's going to embed itself
2634080	2639560	into all comment sections and we're not going to be able to comment on the section.
2639560	2646800	It'll just always just be like some kind of chaos running through that dialogue forever.
2646800	2652440	Well I don't know man it's really really interesting.
2652440	2653440	I like it.
2653440	2656320	I like the experiment you're doing is pretty cool.
2656320	2657320	Pretty cool.
2657320	2658640	We tried different stuff.
2658640	2662040	We tried to do it like Howard Stern style in the in the V.O. booth.
2662040	2668360	I was like yeah you know I could do any podcast like that and I was like all right well let's
2668360	2671040	go back on the stage we just have nobody there.
2671040	2672480	Let's get it's ups and downs.
2672480	2676600	Well it's like it's like I guess one thing I don't know that anyone I'm just trying to
2676600	2682720	think of a late night show or a show in this format with no audience where it's just this
2683160	2686440	I'd have to go back to the Alan Haivi show late night.
2686440	2687440	Yeah basic cable.
2687440	2688440	That's what it was.
2688440	2689440	Yeah.
2689440	2694000	Nick Bacci as his Andy Richter and it was kind of like quiet and wasn't there an audience
2694000	2695000	of one or something.
2695000	2699640	Yeah I think there was like I mean you can always like hear a couple of people chuckling
2699640	2700640	here and there.
2700640	2705920	It reminds me of like local TV or Joe Bob Briggs like Monster Vision where it just it
2705920	2712560	was obvious it was just one guy in a studio like this with maybe three people laughing
2712680	2713680	behind the camera.
2713680	2719120	Yeah a guy tweeted at me and he was like there's like several tweets chained together and he's
2719120	2728960	like I I know you I know you think it's easier to I can't remember what his presuppositions
2728960	2734720	were but he was like like I urge you to listen to the early episodes I think you'll find
2734720	2739880	that they're better like he was like really like breaking it to me that the podcast is
2739880	2745920	worse when there's no fucking audience so it's like responding to him going like what
2745920	2749760	is your point like what do you think is at stake here I don't understand.
2749760	2753400	Well I don't I think he's probably saying like it's not that the podcast is worse it's
2753400	2760920	like if you do a format that's generally made for an audience minus the audience it produces
2760920	2766160	and then you add to it no I didn't know this guy was I can guarantee you this guy was basically
2766280	2772760	he was like he wanted the audience back and thought that even though he said he just finished
2772760	2776520	listening to all of the episodes so I don't know how you get through that without the
2776520	2784440	information that this isn't really a choice like so right to like weigh in and go I don't
2784440	2789240	know it's kind of like you're out in the middle of nowhere and like your your truck has got
2789240	2793040	one tire in the ditch and people are like trying to get a piece of wood under the tire
2793080	2797480	but then some other people are like well maybe if we sing and dance like me who's who who
2797480	2801800	says who says this wasn't our destination and like as long as the trucks not working
2801800	2808520	and all this stuff just to have have one guy there going like you know I think if you really
2808520	2812640	think about it pound for pound what we're going through right now is actually worse
2812640	2819000	than than what what was happening yesterday I was like thanks Miles no shit right no shit
2819200	2826400	man his name was Miles it was to me that's a great name for somebody commenting on a truck
2826400	2836240	that yeah stopped Miles to go Miles Togo Miles to go Togo but yeah we will soon be back in front
2836240	2839040	of an audience but then the cut you know be careful what you wish for because I think that
2839040	2845360	you know there's gonna come a point you know that that's that's gonna be like a return threshold
2845560	2853320	and then you know those are that's how stories end we just go okay we did it we did this then
2853320	2860560	we did that and then we did this then we did it like this yay and it's gonna be like 45 like
2860560	2868200	what what do we what do we what do we what are we you're 45 yeah I'm saying like there there may
2868200	2875800	become a day when when the appropriate thing for me to do for my own happiness and to and to evolve
2875800	2884680	is actually has not only nothing to do with a public life but also in fact maybe actually be
2884680	2891320	counter to a public life you know what I mean like do you think you're resisting something do you
2891320	2899280	feel resistant in what what can you get more specific just like you know like when you're in
2899280	2904520	a situation and you and you realize you don't want to be in that situation it you could be in you
2904520	2909600	know in general like do you think you're you find yourself feeling like resisting what's happening
2910560	2923360	more more often than not I find myself trying to trying to find my bliss in situations that by
2923360	2932200	definition and that's a very appropriate phrase by definition because everything by definition like
2932200	2939600	kind of excludes it starts to run counter to bliss following so so like let's say you so you do
2939600	2945120	something fun and then you say let's do something fun every week yeah and then you can you gotta
2945120	2949720	strike that balance you just do everybody does like like okay we're gonna have a book club we're
2949720	2957520	gonna get together every Wednesday and you know you a big boy understands that sometimes if you're
2957520	2962440	getting together every single Wednesday for your book club yeah there's gonna be some Wednesdays
2962440	2967480	when you're not the one who's so stoked about showing up on Wednesday hey you're kind of an
2967480	2974480	asshole if you show up therefore on Wednesday with this like kill the book club vibe whatever
2974480	2980280	because for all you know everybody else on that particular Wednesday is like kind of in a good
2980280	2987120	mood and like like like actually the book club is there to carry them you know and it's this is
2987120	2992400	this it's the nature of things you start you schedule them you make them regular you decide
2992400	3002600	to do them you you you and and there's always gonna be this like struggle to balance the let's
3002600	3009640	let's always do this with oh and by the way let's always do whatever the fuck we feel like doing I
3009840	3014560	mean I that thing that you are doing with this thing has always blown me away because it is the
3014560	3021800	regularity of the complexity of it the getting getting here even now doing it like this is it's
3021800	3028520	insane like when I do my podcast I go into my studio I get high I've got synthesizers and I
3028520	3033880	just putter around in there until something like happens that I like and it's pride it's very
3033880	3039760	private like they were telling me that you were you felt good that you were able to do this minus
3039760	3046160	an audience and I was thinking like holy shit man I mean like doing it with an audience is madness
3046160	3052080	it's madness it's such a when I go on tour with my podcast that's like a it's heavy for me like
3052080	3058240	that's a it's a huge it feels like big and like any kind of time I do a live show it feels like
3058240	3065520	really just very intense and less like what it is when I record it which is just a day of just
3065520	3072240	allowing whatever happens have to happen so it's I don't I mean I could understand you feeling
3072240	3076840	starting to really feel weird about what you've been doing it makes sense to me I hope I don't
3076840	3081320	seem like I'm judging the way that you're feeling because I get it man it's just I get it I think
3081320	3087640	it's just very hyper pressurized what you've been doing a weekly live show in front of a
3087640	3094120	really smart audience some of whom are really fucking mean and the champ the challenge is to
3094120	3098720	yeah is to it's a high-pressure thing to decide that you're gonna do something every week and
3098720	3108840	then the and then the fun worthwhile pressure is the fun worthwhile activity is it was once
3108840	3116280	squeak I moved I can't move I think that was an accident it was it was it was I moved my foot was
3116280	3120600	falling asleep and I put it on the floor the fun worthwhile activity is trying to figure out how
3120600	3125000	to take something that you've you've determined you guys looked at me like I spit in his drink
3125000	3131200	and then also like like continue to be like okay well then on top of that then how is it always
3131200	3136400	different and challenging and fun or whatever whatever that word is chaotic or something you
3136400	3146800	know like it I think that I think that a nice death that's occurred with this venue is the death
3146800	3156080	of my idea that it was gonna ever grow into a into any into something that had more structure you
3156080	3162520	know I thought like maybe that would grow like it's like you put up a trellis and then like a
3163000	3171880	crazy chaotic thing that just grows by nature uses the trellis so the combination of the of the out of
3171880	3177600	the moment like backbreaking carpentry plus the it's okay that thing everything's just gonna grow
3177600	3184760	over this that's that's my fantasy of doing things you know that aren't for money you go like oh wow
3184760	3189520	it's cool that we grew that thing into this thing so yeah Channel 101 like grew into this thing and
3189520	3195880	like it wasn't it was neither based on us not giving a shit nor was it based on us giving too
3195880	3203560	much of a shit it was just sort of like just grew well this thing's still growing just not growing
3203560	3207680	what you thought it would yeah exactly I think that's an important part of its growth is the
3207680	3211640	you know there was a part of Point Channel 101's history when Shrove and I were like are we gonna
3211640	3216440	keep being the ones with our thumb on the switch because the thing started this idea that the
3216440	3221280	audience is always in charge and then we kind of tweaked the system to allow for us to not even
3221280	3228480	be involved and that was an important thing like the likewise this this the growth of this show I
3228480	3233880	think this is an interesting chapter because it's like I was like let's move it to Starburns and
3233880	3239640	then let's like for the subscribers we could have like video segments and we can you know I just had
3239640	3243280	these ambitions I never made the mistake of thinking I'm gonna work really hard on the show
3243280	3248840	but I always thought I made the mistake of thinking oh we'll move in and we'll set up a
3248840	3254520	foundation and then shit will grow on top of that like everyone will keep wanting to add to it and
3254520	3261640	it'll like grow into this thing and and then the fucking election happened and then I and then it
3261640	3269120	just like every nobody nobody nobody it's just like we all across the entire country we like
3269520	3277880	the music changed for everybody it didn't matter what dance move you were about to do and what
3277880	3282160	plans you had with other people it's just like all of you know it's just like fucking everything
3282160	3286040	shifted and then and then the smart creative people are like okay how do we adapt to this
3286040	3293280	but there's no question that it was just like like it kind of disrupted everything you feel
3293280	3299960	like this is related to the election yes this is connected to the political climate of the United
3299960	3305000	States I don't know if it's connected to the political climate but it's definitely connected
3305000	3315880	to the event of of like the election and it's like social repercussions and things yes I like
3315880	3322640	you know so like on Friday night I had a little a little party and I was like fuck man like this
3322640	3329440	is how selfish I am I'm like fuck god damn it World War three is gonna start on the night of
3329440	3333280	this party that I'm throwing and I was like bum because it's like everything's gonna come and
3333280	3338600	then there's gonna be nuclear war or something and it's gonna like fuck up the party and I was like
3338600	3343600	I was like goddamn that's such a selfish thought but then I realized like whoa man like you're I
3343600	3348960	started getting anxious you know beyond that you know I started getting scared and worried and
3348960	3356160	nervous about World War three and then and dying and then I kind of realized like oh I have no
3356160	3361120	control over that like there's nothing I could do there's no phone calls to be made there's
3361120	3368920	nothing to be done about this these are massive massive gears that are turning and that you know
3368920	3375680	I don't know much of what can really be done about it right now like in this single moment do you
3375680	3382880	think that's naive or like a form of nihilism or to just suddenly just realize like oh actually I
3382880	3390040	don't really care about the president or political climates or empires or governors or principalities
3390040	3396760	or powers I'm just using my mind is becoming attached to that because there's a bigger problem
3396760	3405040	I'm trying to avoid no I don't I don't think there's anything weird or wrong with that I think
3405120	3410480	isn't that pretty much how you felt the entire time and isn't everybody just catching up with you?
3410480	3416240	No I don't know I don't I go back and forth everyone's just exhausted and tired of caring yeah you
3416240	3423280	never really did care you knew it was dumb before everybody else like it was we some of us tried and
3423280	3429920	then we're like herniated or fucking embarrassingly putty like muscles of of like and and revealed
3429920	3438080	that we were hypocrites and yeah everyone is tired now and and and it yeah no there's nothing
3438640	3444160	there's nothing wrong with that mode of thinking I'm I didn't even know that we were about to be
3444160	3450880	in world war three the the student has become the master in that regard I was minecrafting
3451680	3457920	like where there is no war and there is no president and you know I'm waiting waiting to
3458800	3469600	you know waiting to cash in and and head for the hills man this is great man I'm reading this book
3469600	3475440	right now this is perfect it's it's this new book by the zen roshi roshi jone halla facts
3475440	3479360	I think it's called standing on the edge it's really good but it's about edge states
3480000	3488640	and it talks about like you know altruism healthy altruism and unhealthy altruism and how like a
3488640	3494240	person who's like got a really good heart and he really wants things to be better really wants
3494240	3501760	things to be better in the world can like fall over the edge into absolute despair and absolute
3501760	3507360	just just broken heartedness and like she she gives all these examples she's amazing she like
3507920	3516080	you know I'm like planning parties and like like having a really fun life she's like does she like
3516080	3520720	flies to you know there's just that big earthquake that happened recently I think it was in Nepal
3520720	3525760	right where's that big earthquake where was that there's like a massive wasn't recent recently but
3525760	3533280	the point is she like flies to places where people are suffering and sets up camps and gets blankets
3533280	3540080	flown in and like just tries to help and she doesn't do it in a real flashy showy way I've
3540080	3543680	met her she's just this is just what she does she's go or this here we are on planet earth here's
3543680	3551680	what you do and so she encounters people who do who are doing those things with her and she watches
3551680	3560160	some people get just fucking shattered on their altruism just get broken apart in their compassion
3560160	3564880	how do they get broken apart because because because what happens is is like you become bitter
3565440	3569440	you go you go out there to help you have an expectation that you're going to make things
3569440	3576160	better you come into contact with a really a reality which is that oh really you're you're not
3576160	3580080	going to make everything better in fact things might be getting worse while you're trying to
3580080	3585120	make things better right but in your mind you are like oh no I'm going to do it or it could be done
3585120	3590560	or it might be and then so but suddenly you're like you're watching people bring their children
3590560	3597280	to like triage centers where it's like no that's that kid's gonna die and you're watching that
3597280	3602880	happen day after day after day after day it's it's kind of what you do with animals rob you know
3602880	3608400	what I mean and and you you like if you if you don't watch what you're doing and you fall on
3608400	3613680	the other side what ends up happening is the darkness consumes you you know it's that classic
3613680	3618160	thing you the thing you're fighting you become and you don't even realize it's happened to you
3618160	3623440	and then suddenly you're all broken apart by and then the fucking thing won then it won you know
3623440	3628720	that's the crazy thing about it is the way the darkness wins is not by killing people who are
3628720	3634560	fighting it it wins by getting into their hearts and then and then you know what I mean like sith
3634560	3639760	style sorry to use a star it's like that it like it's like gets you and you don't even know it got
3640320	3643200	it's a cool book it's really good I really love it what's it called
3643200	3646880	I think it's called standing on the edge you mind if I google it real quick I'll tell you it's like
3646880	3651840	it's about edge states and I'll talk while you do that hey Dan what would you do today you did
3651840	3660320	some minecraft that must have been fun yeah I just finished uh level three no are there levels in
3660320	3665840	minecraft well if you don't know why would you cut me off and you asked me about minecraft I'm being
3665920	3670080	trying I'm trying to reach out and make a connection all right I don't have to
3670080	3675600	I'm trying to make an emotional bid okay well can I answer it can I tell you about minecraft a
3675600	3682480	little bit yes yeah there's that fire behind your eyes you don't want to hear about minecraft
3683760	3686560	I got no internet in here it's just google the new book by
3687520	3694400	Joan I just finished gathering all of the necessary ingredients for a tier one void
3694400	3703760	resource void ore miner uh from the environmental tech pack in minecraft that's badass yeah it took
3703760	3711280	a great deal of diamonds and other materials that were hard to come by I went to monster palooza
3712160	3726000	this afternoon with Kumail and Jonah and we looked at monster paloozas you mean masks
3727680	3738320	yes masks and bootleg DVDs my therapist told me the name of some guy that like I don't know I said
3738320	3743680	because I said like oh can you uh you know how you taught me to deal with like relationships
3743680	3749760	like by explaining rules and stuff is there rules for how to be interested in people because it
3749760	3758960	seems like that's become the what we're really talking about for me is like well the when I
3758960	3766000	talk about the election I don't mean oh everything changed because of who became president I mean
3766720	3774160	I mean we all like our whole mission statement changed and and my therefore me as a parasite
3774160	3779760	as a person who's like just just always wanted to fit in or make people like me or not get beat up
3779760	3787840	or just be funny or whatever it's like that's scrambled my signal so like that's a good thing
3787840	3793280	because then it then you you you finally get to a place where you're like okay so let's just care
3793280	3801120	about dan what do you want right and then you go okay well I'm gonna lock that down that down okay
3801920	3808240	um and then what's left is sort of like other people like what am I supposed to how am I
3808240	3815120	supposed to interact with them and it's like uh you know I guess I'm you know and the therapist
3815120	3819600	gave me some materials or something to look at but I kind of like it's just like a sink full of
3819600	3826160	dishes like I don't want to learn how to how to how to interact with people she's like trying to
3826160	3831040	show you I don't understand I'm not I don't know either because it's like I haven't unpacked it
3831040	3837760	you know it's like like like oh look up this guy read his book watch his ted talk you know
3837760	3844960	like go you'll you'll enter this realm of like this guy is like a guy who like the area the thing
3844960	3850080	that you're talking about this guy would be helpful you know right but I don't I don't I just
3850080	3855760	wrote it down and I'm like yeah I don't know all that stuff is like when I go to these ram das
3855760	3860720	retreats they always talk about mind versus heart like being up in your head versus in your heart
3860720	3864800	and all that stuff's so heady it's all mental it's all like you're up in your head it's like
3864800	3869040	those books will get you up in your head now that's bad books are great but like some of those it's
3869040	3874080	like as opposed to just like oh well I love it because it's so simple because it's like just
3874080	3879520	what you're in right now it's perfect it's fine even if the thing you're in right now is just this
3880160	3886800	simmering cauldron of whatever it is it's that idea of like yeah that's where we're at right now
3886800	3891280	I'm that thing and then feel that without any expectations like oh I'm gonna change it
3892000	3897600	that's this thing that um what's her name Pima Chodron another Buddhist teacher she says
3898160	3905440	people say oh we're gonna start meditating because we want to be a better person and she says that's
3905440	3910640	an aggression against the you that you are right now the idea is not to meditate to become a better
3910640	3917840	person the idea is to meditate so that you could be yourself more fully feel yourself more fully
3917840	3922480	I love that idea it's just so fun to just play around the idea that where you're at right now
3922560	3928560	this this where you're at this where you're at fucking it's perfect yeah I find myself last
3928560	3934480	couple like like I've gotten to some dark places I've been really upset I was connected to my dog
3934480	3940240	getting sick and stuff are these things like cue like operas in your head yeah like pockets of magma
3940240	3948320	and things like okay now I have an excuse to flush that vein of lava uh so I don't know what's going
3948320	3956080	on down there but I know on top it's like the reality not the illusion is numbness and stillness
3956080	3960880	and so then I have these conversations with people like my therapist or or just anybody who's like
3960880	3965040	actually interested it goes like well what where are you really at and then I found myself going
3965920	3974320	well I guess you know kom sikom sa like like and then the the like oh what do you mean don't you
3974320	3979040	think this and that it's like the the other person like wants so much more than stillness and
3979040	3985600	numbness and they can have it but then that's that's that's fracking like it's like okay
3985600	3992880	where you're gonna pierce me and you're gonna dig down and it's not necessarily more true what's
3992880	3998320	boiling down beneath in the core of the earth like that's no more the earth than the crust
3998320	4005040	and the polar ice caps and all this stuff like I I just feel on my surface right now like I just
4005040	4013680	like numb yeah just so numb yeah like I just reduced to like but then it's nice what I noticed
4013680	4019280	in my behavior is like well you haven't gotten on twitter in like three days and you didn't even
4019280	4023360	do it by saying you were gonna quit twitter for three days like you forgot to get on twitter
4023360	4030720	because you're fucking numb and when numbness comes also you don't need to self-abuse what is
4030720	4038000	the so how would you like if you had to instead of just saying numbness like how would you describe
4038000	4045680	the numbness what is it how would you describe it if you couldn't use the word numb stasis I don't
4045680	4053920	know I mean is it like it's like it's like is it if it were is it solid is it like malleable is it
4053920	4061520	is it is it changing does it come and go would have a color associated with it is it opaque
4061520	4068320	like how would you just what is it I think I feel like it's like I don't know if I controlled it or
4068320	4076720	someone else did but I feel like it's like uh going around the house it's and like shutting off
4076720	4085520	like like it's or it's it's like like like like there's like white noise that you get used to
4085520	4090640	you're just like oh I'm on a submarine so like I just hear all the time background noise sounds
4090640	4100640	like this because that's what it takes to run a submarine and then like it's just silent running
4100640	4108160	like you just like oh one by one you're just turning off equipment and I don't know if I did
4108160	4114000	that or if that's like a Russian weapon that or you know what I mean like I'm not gonna claim
4114000	4118240	credit for it it's just a it's just a thing that has happened that's the state you mean you feel
4118240	4123520	like it's like a shutting down yeah it's like an energy that's sort of like there was some energy
4123520	4130480	and then that energy is now turning itself off yeah like like like like but but for a purpose
4130480	4138880	like waiting it's about time it's about like we were being counterproductive with the worrying and
4138880	4147520	the and the pinging and the periscoping and all this things so like okay go deep and shut everything
4147920	4155360	and just you know like and it because it not because nothing is important because everything
4155360	4161760	is important because we're hunting the red october I don't know like like like it's it's it's it's the
4161760	4168480	time for for nothing right now it doesn't feel purposeless right I feel if I thought that this
4168480	4174800	was my new life I'd put a bullet in my head because I'd be like well that's boring but I feel
4174800	4188080	anticipation I feel like like okay this chapter is wrapping up like everything all my energy
4188080	4194400	creatively is being put into like tying knots on things going like okay let's get this off my plate
4195040	4200160	not don't okay say no to that pitch don't do that don't start that don't promise that
4200160	4208720	and then like let everything like like come down to uh to a to a to a point of complete silence
4208720	4215920	and then so that the orchestra can start and the metaphor mixer can can mix the metaphor of the
4215920	4224720	submarine and the orchestra monster palooza who gives a fuck about that stupid ass fucking
4225440	4234480	kamil jonah great me wow what did you buy any masks I didn't but I bought a bunch of dvds
4234480	4241040	that I'm gonna watch when I get home I bought a Zachary Lee album monster album
4243840	4253520	Zachary Lee monster album I'm gonna listen to that on my turntable and I bought some dvds
4255680	4262080	uh I'm mad because I got that that breathalyzer uh keychain and I was like really excited about it
4262080	4271840	but you have to wait 15 minutes to get an accurate reading which makes no sense that sucks so bad
4274400	4279120	you have to wait you have to breathe on it and here's the here's the directions for the breathalyzer
4279120	4286080	stop drinking wait 20 minutes blow into the thing then you'll know how drunk you are
4286080	4292000	motherfucker if I had the presence of mind I got the thing because it was 60 bucks I thought oh
4292000	4299360	this might be a cool way to like create awareness you know I just like start putting a number
4299360	4307200	if I'm you know if I am an asshole if I'm angry if I you know like start start putting like road
4307200	4313920	flares on no man and then go like oh shit the last time I blew a point eight I you know I was
4313920	4325280	point eight by the way he he doesn't call me anymore dude that's cool that's like thanks man
4325280	4330000	I just pulled that out of my ass right now but do you think that do you think the ones the cops
4330000	4335280	use like like like do you think if you get pulled over by the cops and they and they go like are
4335280	4339920	you do you want to blow into this thing like are you actually supposed to say well you want to give
4339920	4346320	me 20 minutes because I just or take me to dinner like it's counterintuitive but but but maybe their
4346320	4350800	dirty little secret is that they're like they ask you are you willing to blow a breathalyzer and
4350800	4358560	because your instinct as a drunk driver is to say uh or they or they go or they maybe they
4358560	4365040	I've never been pulled over like and checked like that but maybe maybe they say uh uh when's the
4365680	4372480	last time you had a drink and unless and if you say I just had one like five minutes ago before
4372480	4379920	I got in my car the irony is you're allowed to wait 15 more minutes but no one wants to say that
4379920	4383760	because it sounds like a confession of drunk driving wait you have to wait 15 minutes before
4383760	4389200	you blow into it yeah but I don't I'm hoping that that's a that's a function of the cheap
4389200	4394880	shitty keychain thing that I I I heard it makes sense though it's in your stomach isn't there
4394880	4401760	like they give you a choice you can blow in the breathalyzer here or you can go down to the
4401760	4407520	station and blow into the breathalyzer there don't you don't they give you a choice I heard that
4407520	4414400	and then they say you know go down to the station because by the time you get to the station you'll
4414400	4420880	probably sober up enough to not be drunk and or if it if it if it if their equipment works the
4420880	4430000	same way as this piece of shit I got from amazon um uh sober or not your result if you just like
4430000	4434800	you know within 20 minutes like is is just off the fucking charts it's not accurate
4435520	4441200	it's not accurate unless you wait but but I'm thinking come on it's gotta be
4441200	4447840	just because the the cheap ones I don't know get a get a get a get a get a get a get a $70 one
4447840	4454160	get a fancy one that seems like good money after bad and why don't you get a get a fancy one
4454160	4463440	get one with your name on it a designer breathalyzer yeah just do it just just do it just let it all
4463440	4468800	hang out with another ten dollars just do it it would be amazing if they had technology wouldn't
4468800	4475840	be great if they had technology that was so like like the the constant like if you could digitally
4475840	4481280	know immediately how drunk you were like if it was as simple as GPS like you don't have to put
4481280	4486000	any effort into it and then you could just choose to set your twitter or your your phone in general
4486000	4492320	your text messages but like you you choose your settings like when you're sober but like you go
4492320	4497840	like look you are Andy Dick right now like like like are you and and you're about to text your
4497840	4502000	so-and-so like you could you could create lists of people or if they could hook it up if your
4502000	4507760	apple watch could connect to your iPhoto library so that underneath each photo it showed your
4507760	4513440	blood alcohol level yeah that'd be incredible you could you could set your email settings to be like
4514320	4517920	hey like when you were sober
4520080	4527040	you you you made me promise that when you clicked send on an email i would go okay i sent it and
4527040	4532240	then wait six hours and then review with you you know yeah then you'd be like god damn it i don't
4532240	4539120	know what's the worst drunk email you ever sent oh god i don't know i mean i i i've i've i've i
4539280	4545120	stopped using email so long ago like what do you think's the worst drunk tweet you ever did
4547280	4547760	i don't know
4551440	4555920	i don't know i mean like the drunkest most out of control stuff i think was just like
4557040	4563040	there was an article about it it was like some some i'd like yelled at some kid for for three
4563040	4570320	hours or something you're a sober guy rob huh no i i fucking i fucking drank you ever blast out
4570320	4578880	any drunk tweets yeah but nothing angry just something stupid i'm trying to think of what's
4578880	4588960	the dumbest thing i've ever tweeted it's hard to categorize it probably be easier to i got really
4589040	4594160	drunk at a party once and i said oh i'm gonna go fuck those black girls or something like that
4594160	4600080	i think that's probably i think i and i think i screamed that to you from across the the party
4600080	4605520	i think that's probably the worst thing i've ever done you you you muttered it through gritted teeth
4605520	4614640	to me and jeff oh god that was a bad that was the worst you were lonely i was ugly lonely i was just
4614640	4621360	like i didn't i did not like that time in my life that was a really really dark time
4623120	4630480	i think we've all been there ugly lonely ugly lonely and drunk yeah fuck man the only
4631440	4639520	the only thing that makes you graceful lonely is time which is really just saying your taste buds
4639520	4645040	go dead you know like it's there's no there's no hero or villain in that process it's like from my
4645040	4654720	experience you're if you don't know loneliness enough yet you overreact to it and act like a
4654720	4660960	big fucking tool that is going to embarrass you later when you become mature which becoming
4660960	4666960	mature does not involve you going to a crossroads and learning the blues uh because you really wanted
4666960	4674240	to evolve yourself becoming mature you the laziest least mature people become mature because they
4674240	4679200	get old and tired and they start experiencing the same fucking shit over and over again because
4679200	4684880	they don't make any effort to change so they're lonely a million times and then they're like this
4684880	4690640	isn't so bad it's kind of like the last time and i know it'll end again and that's not wisdom and
4690640	4697680	it shouldn't be i hate that we when we get old like high road young people when really it's just
4697680	4705680	like yeah yeah like every spider-man 4 is the third movie you've ever seen like like why are
4705680	4712080	we arguing i've seen 700 more movies than you i don't remember the last 30 because my brain is
4712080	4719920	dying i i like it's just like we we don't do anything heroic to transform we don't like gain
4719920	4724880	we don't level up because we're good people we just like we just keep living and tasting
4724880	4729200	shit and we get bored with it well that's the one thing i love about buddhism is the concept
4729200	4735040	of fundamental dissatisfaction which is the idea that oh no you're that is actually to be human
4735600	4743040	so it's it's so the the i think the big lie is that comes from all the fucking spider-man movies
4743040	4748560	and all the movies and lots of stuff is we tell these people no no no no it gets better
4749440	4755280	that'll go away that gnawing empty thing inside of you i'll go away and in buddhism is like no
4756000	4761680	that's like a fish saying one day i'm going to be dry well when you're dry you're dead fish
4761760	4766560	and in the same way for a human to think that that thing goes away is one of the great ways
4766560	4772320	a human tortures itself yeah also the the idea of looking forward to it like that's a good thing
4772320	4777440	it's that would be like saying the best example i can think of is imagine if these like parkland
4777440	4784400	kids that that whatever comes of what they did just imagine if they had been cool enough to
4784400	4789600	realize how little they'll care in 10 years or had they taken cues from all the people
4790320	4795680	uh previous like they just like they reacted from the from the place that they were in and it was
4795680	4800800	like yeah they didn't react like 30 year olds or 40 year olds and as a result like they got shit
4800800	4808080	done that i don't know like like we don't and young filmmakers and and everything young we
4808080	4815680	worship youth but we make fun of its naivete like like wisdom is just is just is just it's just
4815680	4819680	dying a little bit it's just it's just going like yeah it's gets a little boring i remember
4819680	4825120	my dad i was like i was like 25 and he was however old he was and i i just couldn't believe how old
4825120	4830400	my dad was and i was like and it was a legitimate question in my head and i was like if it was if
4830400	4835200	he was any other human being i wouldn't i would know that this would be tacky and rude and then
4835200	4839200	i might get punched or yeah yeah just that it would be hurtful but it's like your dad's here
4839200	4847680	just like fuck it this is the guy i can ask this question because fuck him um and i was like so now
4847680	4854080	that you're this old like you ever you you're scared that you're gonna die and stuff like
4854080	4859120	which is like really gnawing at me is it is it my guy in my 20s like i was like really thinking
4859120	4864720	about like what it must be have to think about death all the time and i remember my dad being
4864720	4878640	like yeah nice kind of been alive a long time and he starts to get kind of boring depressed
4878640	4883680	yeah well i wasn't i don't know who characterized my dad as a depressed guy well i mean i disagree
4883680	4887920	with you on what and what you're saying and and i used to think that i just don't think that's true
4887920	4892240	and i used to think it though i know people think that but when they're when i've been
4892240	4897360	numbed down i've thought that but i don't think that's actually it for me well i certainly don't
4897360	4902400	want to i don't want to make the mistake of going like i figured it out that's the one law by which
4902400	4909360	the universe goes i keep going because i know that there's this other you just i think the beauty of
4909360	4915920	it is you stumble upon something really beautiful and in your the you know man i like kind of like
4916720	4921920	came out of the closet with this ram das stuff you know i have a guru and i i'm really i feel
4921920	4928320	really good and i used to feel really bad and i feel really really good and i feel love in my life
4928320	4935360	and i feel really good i know it's like it feels lame to say that but uh but i used to think like
4935360	4941040	what you the way you're talking i used to think it was like an infinite mordorscape or something
4941040	4946240	and that it just goes on forever kind of never-ending mordorscape in fact maybe it just gets worse and
4946240	4952080	worse and then what happens is all this fucking shit the hippies are saying you hear it and and
4952080	4957360	from that mordorscape and you shut the fuck up that can't be real it's not real but then you
4957360	4961920	kind of that's the entryway you know and then you start like you're like what i would do is kind of
4961920	4966560	like you know i'm gonna be like this like anthropologist i'm gonna go into this and i'm
4966560	4972400	gonna find out where it's not real by being part of it and then you start realizing it's real
4973040	4977200	and then that thing that you're talking about that afflicts a great many people
4977920	4982320	which is that sense of like oh fuck my brain's rotting i'm getting old it just gets boring this
4982320	4989600	is terrible oh my like that thing you realize oh my god it doesn't have to be like that for real
4989600	4994320	and now you're in a real predicament because you either have to when people are saying things like
4994400	4999440	what you're saying you have to decide like oh my god am i going to be the fucking guy who says that
4999440	5004080	thing and or am i going to keep my mouth shut about it or am i going to be like roll like be
5004080	5010000	cynical or try to tune into like that and now it's like fuck i have to say it because it's
5010000	5014400	incredibly unethical if i don't and you know what i mean it's incredibly unethical to be like
5014400	5020000	no i know you mean you know or to not say it's actually it doesn't it doesn't work like that
5020000	5026880	you know it it can if it can and that's okay i mean and that the the the lineage i've become
5026880	5032320	part of the paradigm is not one incarnation it's like we get many many many of these things
5032320	5035760	and that is not to say to take it for granted but it's also to say in this one you really just
5035760	5042000	might be miserable for the entire incarnation but what's and i they they don't say that with like a
5042000	5045840	you really might be miserable for this entire incarnation if you don't do what they say
5045840	5051360	they just might be say like yeah this one it might be a sad one for you and and and and that's
5051360	5055920	okay that's okay not to be like no you could be like you should be better they're like no
5055920	5059600	this is a perfect universe i wish there was more standardized language about
5061120	5067440	mood and stuff i feel like i feel like if i answer the question honestly like how are you doing
5067440	5075280	in a bar uh to someone and like like very often people will be like oh you're so hard on yourself
5075280	5080400	or hope you get better and all that stuff and i'll be like well wait wait you don't understand
5080400	5088640	i'm incredibly happy yeah that's it yeah like like i i i'm just ashamed of myself by default
5088640	5095280	like i'm filled with shame which is like a a mechanism like it's like my plumbing like needs
5095280	5102240	to be like like wrenched a little bit in therapy and stuff because it was just like just flooded
5102560	5108720	i just run on shame i like like you a device could run on water it could run on steam it
5108720	5115920	could run on oil like i was like like i just like like just shame just like like is the lubricant
5115920	5121520	shame is the fucking like well another way to put that would be the thing you currently think you are
5122400	5128240	thinks it runs on shame you know but that's not you know the the idea is like really the thing
5128240	5134320	that you are is much bigger than a thing that thinks it runs on shame part of what there are
5134320	5139200	another way to put it be there is shame here or there is shame another way to put it's called
5139200	5144080	noting and buddhism you just watch it shame you so like and then what you're doing is like something
5144080	5151840	that sharon salzburg calls add-ons so shame happens you feel shame that's it there is shame
5151840	5156800	but then the mind starts attaching all this shit to the shame right so now it becomes like this
5156800	5160960	sort of recursion it just goes on and on and on with the mind saying oh because of their shame
5160960	5164000	this must be this and that must mean that and that must mean that and that so that's called
5164000	5171040	in buddhism the poisoned arrow you get hit by the arrow that's the first pain shame usually it's a
5171040	5175600	triggering thing it's not even shame it's like something happens and the event is the arrow and
5175600	5181040	then that then shame and then all the add-ons but really it's just shame there is shame here
5181040	5186880	in this field of matter called my human body and then that's it you just sit with it and then when
5186880	5192880	the add-ons come all this other stuff too it's like okay that's there too but to say i'm a machine
5192880	5201200	that runs on shame is true now you know what i mean well i don't yeah i didn't mean to proclaim
5201200	5206160	it as like i'm i'm i'm i know i'm sorry the whole thing is like an expression of like
5206160	5214560	like i am changing and i'm going to change yeah like i'm not resigned to the way that i run
5214560	5224720	shit but i like yeah i just kind of like i i just feel like i feel like like it's it i just
5224720	5229680	like people go like they listen to me talking then they go like oh he's so depressed and he's
5229680	5234720	so sad or he's so you know and then i go like well no if you talk like the way i'm talking
5234720	5239120	then that might be indicative that these might be words that you would only say
5239120	5245440	if you were about to put a gun in your mouth yes but like because of how fucked up i am like
5246080	5251600	this is like like you know these are my metaphors and this is my language and this is this is my
5251600	5259200	baseline yeah it does need to be improved and lightened but that's the same as like
5259200	5266560	somebody who's middle class saying i need to be rich like the middle class person is like my my
5266560	5274080	middle line is just there's a lugubriousness to the to the language yeah because it's based on
5274080	5281200	shame because i like i i i went into my therapist office and it was like she's like how did how did
5281200	5285200	how did how did it go with nigel and all this stuff and and it was like he's good he's better
5285200	5291440	he's better so i saw him in a much better mood i'm feeling very good now nigel's feeling better
5291440	5299520	because our last session nigel was very sick and i was very very upset and i was like i was i was
5299520	5308160	saying like i have this like i don't know where to put this rage and shame like i can't get rid
5308160	5314640	of it and she she we spent the entire hour doing all these exercises of like going underneath this
5314640	5319200	layer and that layer and all this stuff and then we we went out in the sidewalk and walked like a
5319200	5325040	fucking python sketch and whatever the fuck and like all of it had different effects and things
5325040	5330000	but and it wasn't about it working or not working but the bottom line is it came back to the office
5330000	5338560	and i was like she's like how's that and i'm like it's i'm it it's on fire like like it thinks for
5338560	5343040	blowing on it or putting a blanket over it for a second but the blanket is flammable and it's like
5343040	5350880	there is a fire i can't i just want to beat something to death i want to kill i want to hurt
5350880	5357840	i want to finish something i want to hurt something and i and i and i know i'm not supposed
5357840	5362560	to want that and i can't blah blah blah and and you know we got through that session so
5362560	5366320	then a week later i come i come back in now during that week nigel gets better
5367760	5371920	so then i sit in the chair and she goes like how are you how is it going well nigel's better so
5371920	5378000	i feel fucking great i walked into that room on a rainbow i was like one of those days where i'm
5378000	5384240	like well this is 200 bucks wasted because i feel great um but and then she's like well so
5386080	5390480	see making progress right and i'm like and then the whole session is based on the fact that my
5390480	5396080	response to that was like no no progress made whatsoever absolutely none yeah the only thing
5396080	5404720	that happened is my dog got better i didn't learn how to handle anything and she's like no but you
5405280	5413840	you when when your cat got sick you punched a wall yes this time did you punch a wall no i did not
5413840	5422480	so we would call that uh progress for the wall mason's union like like like if jack the ripper
5423440	5431600	chokes a hooker to death uh on monday and then on wednesday like he just sits in a pub and
5431600	5438240	and draws pictures in his notebook about of dead hookers great day for hookers great amount of
5438240	5446320	progress from monday to wednesday great day for his victims not for him not in my opinion and so
5446320	5451840	we fought and fought i mean i fought it's like but then by the end of the session she was like
5451840	5458320	she basically was like the whole time was like making me realize how hard you're fighting you
5458320	5465200	don't want to say that you are better well i mean maybe you're not and then the other question is
5465200	5468480	like but she didn't want it she was like she was like asking me like does your god believe in
5468480	5476560	incremental change is your god willing to does your god think that a little bit of progress is
5476560	5484000	is is good enough and i was like the honest answer is no no i do not worship a god that
5484000	5492320	gives out medals for for doing better than yesterday by a skosh i don't and and and that's
5492320	5498160	because i created that god and etc you created the god i sure did motherfucker damn created
5498160	5503280	yours too what is that like what's up is that a 3d printer how do you do it i fucking pray how
5503280	5508960	do you create a god i pray that's how you do it just prayer dear god make a god for
5509680	5514720	duncan what god did you pray to you to make the god uh master god root god super user god
5515600	5520960	based god man you gotta start listening a little beat that's you know not to give you a prescription
5520960	5525680	i know you turn me on a little bit i love you're doing great but yeah the answer is to you know
5525680	5530080	say thank you based god and hope for his blessings and then you know who knows not
5530080	5534720	that you need anyone's blessings or anything like that but have you heard little b squeaky chair
5537120	5542800	oh okay we heard his feelings you the other thing i keep thinking is like man what is your
5542800	5547040	definition of i mean forget the whole god thing what's your definition of i like what do you think
5547040	5552960	you are definition of what of you of you what do you think you are let me answer that thank you
5556640	5561680	he's great you're great what else like what do you think you are what are you
5566880	5575280	i'm a fragment of an explosion of a of a thing that that uh only knew that
5575920	5584240	being was better than not being and uh yeah i'm a shard with like different amounts of
5584880	5589840	this and that in it than other shards because it's not uniform how big are you
5591040	5598080	shard sized what's that is like your human size foot that you think that's your size your body
5598080	5603840	if you are you getting it do i see myself on a kind of map is like somehow more important than
5603840	5608640	other people no not that at all i'm saying like you know when you're when you start
5608640	5613120	self-referencing in any situation you already know this i know but you start self-referencing
5613120	5616800	you immediately are stuck with like you talk about when i say this it's going to sound like
5616800	5620560	i'm saying you're you talk about yourself a lot but we all do you talk about yourself a lot
5620560	5624000	i'm this thing i'm that thing this is what i am this is how i feel this is who i am this is what
5624000	5628800	i am and then you you start playing this game where you're like okay okay who's talking about
5628800	5640000	me like what's that the thing that's saying what dan is what's that you know the watcher
5640000	5646720	is what they call it or the witness yeah i don't know that thing's interesting huh it's like what
5646720	5651520	is that it's this thing watching you and it's making this comment you're making a commentary
5651520	5656000	it's watching the commentary in fact but there's like there reminds me of a thing that my
5656640	5662240	therapist pointed out because i was i was saying like look i think the thing is the problem is
5662240	5666000	like excuse you said does your god have standards or just or does he have compassion does he just
5666000	5670080	have standards or does he have compassion i said i honestly honest the answer even though i'm going
5670080	5675920	to fucking yell that for it i could lie and say he has compassion and then be like like what no
5675920	5681360	i'll tell you the truth my god has just standards why why doesn't he have compassion because
5681360	5687280	compassion is the idea that the god like was like rooting for you and that's an insane thing to do
5687360	5694000	and and and and so he's he it was like like like those those those ai those robots the the on the
5694000	5699440	youtube videos the guy from mit that created them you know how he expresses his love for that thing
5699440	5704160	his pride in that thing and his desire that it be the best robot he can be his foot comes into frame
5704160	5710000	and he tries to kick it the fuck over as hard as he can because he created it for the purpose
5710000	5716080	of proving that it can overcome that and it can walk like a god no matter and if if if
5716080	5719760	god's foot comes in and goes like no fuck you you thought you knew everything about walking
5719760	5724560	now now fuck you right and then and then the robot goes like this and then it starts walking
5724560	5727840	and that's when you're watching youtube and you go shit we're gonna we're gonna be hunted to
5727840	5734320	extinction yeah because because you're recognizing superiority not not you're not going like oh look
5734320	5738560	at it stumble you're like oh shit that motherfucker knows how to walk right when it gets kicked
5739600	5745200	anyways the the i was trying to explain that to her and then she was like and she was like but
5745680	5751760	so how did you not meet god's standards when nigel got sick and was it because i like i already
5751760	5757200	learned this shit and i said i said you know i recognized that i was doing this script i got to
5757200	5761760	finish this script because like you said i'm sitting on this script because it's my last chance to make
5761760	5766320	myself miserable and then once i finish this script like now i can what i'm afraid of doing
5766320	5771440	is moving on and like dealing with life you know instead of just like sucking my thumb and going
5771440	5776400	like oh i got a deadline so it's kind of similar to minecraft like it's just like you just dig a
5776400	5781760	little hole where you control whether you're miserable or you control the cause of your
5781760	5787040	misery you think and then it was like okay finish the script because you know what it's time to move
5787040	5794240	on because cody might get sick anyone might get sick the the the the syria might explode like
5794240	5798480	everyone might get leukemia on my block like i might find a ball in my nuts and a nut in my
5798480	5804640	balls and like it's time to join that fray it's called life and i had made up my mind that i was
5804640	5810960	ready to do that and then god gave me the littlest tiniest little nibble of of life's caviar called
5810960	5816560	your dog is like trembling and i was like yes and then she stopped me and said all right stop right
5816560	5823840	there stop the characterization of your dog trembling and vomiting and needing to be taken
5823840	5835920	to the hospital as a little nibble of caviar is called a distortion like you're you you have
5835920	5843840	chosen to believe in a god that has bigger fish to fry than your dog and the things that make you
5843840	5853520	upset so that's what i want you to think about is like like like why you know you know the god
5853520	5858880	that you chose isn't the actual one true one you know it's a model why would you choose your model
5858880	5865280	to be so fucking like distorted i don't mean to do this but my question would be who's choosing
5866160	5871440	who is this well i'm saying isn't isn't this like a kind of like chicken egg thing where you go if
5871440	5875520	you're a miserable person you create a miserable god and the god create you know you well you have
5875520	5880320	to you that's like the god thing is like a few years like a few like whether there's a god or
5880320	5885120	not a god you're still still dealing with this like interesting thing that happens with a human
5885120	5889360	which is there is this field of awareness well if you're a miserable person you have a miserable
5889360	5893680	map of the universe well you have the miserable person the miserable person is within a field
5893680	5897680	of awareness there's a field of so like in the bhagavad gita they say there is the field and
5897680	5903440	the knower of the field so what happens with humans is we get caught up in the in the field
5904000	5908320	so and then that's when all the things start happening like you get caught up in the field
5908320	5914000	so you're like when i get caught up in my field myself my life my cell i become selfish literally
5914000	5919520	selfish because i'm deeply caught in my own self like deeply caught in my my own self that's
5919520	5924720	selfishness and so but then when you start playing around with this concept like wait a minute wait
5924720	5931600	a minute there is awareness here that seems to be watching this thing happen right uh-huh that
5931600	5937120	is is where that is where it gets interesting because when you start like playing around with
5937120	5940640	that field of awareness like you know you look in the mirror you can't look back at you can't
5940640	5945360	you you have to look in the mirror to see yourself you can't see yourself right now you have it's a
5945360	5953200	similar problem this is this this field of awareness what is it is it consciousness what is it
5953200	5959040	but within that field all the drama is happening right the drama is happening within the field of
5959040	5964880	awareness and the field of awareness is watching so the practice or one of the practice of
5964880	5974640	mindfulness is not to change anything not to change anything except to watch now we're watching
5974640	5980240	in other words we are trying to shift ourselves from being the field to identifying with the
5980240	5988560	knower of the field and so the concept is moving from individual identity to soul to the soul
5988560	5994320	identity or the like that universal consciousness that's the practice did you fucking fart i think
5994320	6000400	it was a fart not the chair oh no no it was a smell i smelled sulfur that was well that could
6000400	6004800	be because you're talking about this pagan talk no but i really like that that's interesting it's
6004800	6011840	just sort of like awareness of awareness like like identification with the awareness yeah
6011840	6016960	that's it because if there's a camera there to make you feel ashamed if you look fat from a certain
6016960	6023920	angle stop reacting to that by like like people walk by a camera in a department store window and
6023920	6030480	like we get all confused and we start waving our arms and stuff become the camera for a second
6031040	6034800	that's what you're trying to do anyway yeah that's that's you're sitting there wondering
6034800	6040400	how fat you are or what you're doing wrong all this stuff like oh the invitation is to become
6040400	6045040	a more objective point of view because other people will enter that frame yeah you'll become
6045040	6049920	a character yeah and you'll become a shard along with everything like like you put your money where
6049920	6056080	your mouth is instead of like reacting to seeing yourself on the scoreboard by getting more obsessed
6056160	6062960	with your bald spot you go holy shit i'm i'm looking at myself from the perspective of a stadium
6062960	6067520	he has a bald spot so does he so does so does everyone who else does like and then what what
6067520	6073120	is it you know like like yeah that's that's very interesting interesting it's interesting and the
6073120	6080000	only thing is it's like they wouldn't say you were but you you become that they say you are that and
6080000	6085040	that thing has become entangled in this thing yeah so it's not that you become it it's actually
6085040	6088000	that's what you are no that's what you were in the first place otherwise you wouldn't we wouldn't
6088000	6092160	talk the way we do we go like oh i'm such a piece of shit like well it sounds like you're talking

6499920	6506880	milch he's the creator of nypd blue and deadwood he put his dick in beans beans beans is this
6507520	6513360	woman that was like a set decorator is the craziest person i've never heard of i can't
6513360	6519600	we were told an anecdote where david milch like uh at the at the craft service table like right
6519600	6523520	or at a party or something like he i don't know what the fuck you're talking about
6524560	6528480	maybe it was okay yeah i'm speaking out of school that i was like probably like from uh
6529280	6535280	i don't know it was like yeah you were you you were hanging out with chris mckenna but
6535280	6540960	there were a bunch of people that saw it david david milch put his dick in some beans what and
6540960	6545920	then uh how does that ruin you or how does that get out there oh well because there was a bunch
6545920	6549520	it because he was like it basically like he took some beans from the craft service table and then
6549520	6557520	he like he like had his dick in beans and then like and somebody said uh and then everybody's
6557520	6562560	like waiting in line to get their food and then he's just like doing that here and everybody's
6562560	6568560	like uh can you mind the way i was introduced to the the concept was that there were writers
6568560	6575200	who were saying like they among each other like they used the expression like oh man i really put
6575200	6580560	the put my dick in the beans like to mean like is it supposed to feel good i bet it feels no it's
6580560	6585200	well i mean it's no he wasn't doing it to feel good he was doing a bit about like and i i know
6585200	6589040	you have more questions about why he did it but i don't know but it's like their perspective is
6589040	6592640	that he had did it and then and then it was like there was a weird silence and because the guy in
6592640	6598320	charge put his dick in beans and then and then and then so then thereafter it was an expression
6598320	6605760	among these writers of like uh oh shit i i over i overreached i uh i uh i was i was feeling my oats
6605760	6612400	or i i i kind of like uh i just sort of like i just sort of fell on my face or but but but i did
6612400	6619360	it because i was because i wanted to be feel like the scenario is like milch was like trying to be
6619360	6624560	funny whips out a stick puts it in the beans and everybody kind of went oh they were like yeah
6624560	6630400	floor and then he went oh too far all right i guess we're not gonna laugh at me putting my dick
6630400	6639440	in the beans okay um what did you bring to the table bananas but i do think it would i mean not
6639440	6643600	that it's it's it doesn't matter because it's really missing the point but i i do think that
6643600	6650160	like it would probably feel good to put your dick in warmer cold don't even think about it warmer
6650160	6655440	cold okay great point it's not don't even think about it what do you mean of course warm warm
6655440	6661120	warm beans yeah cold you want to put your dick in warm beans not cold beans that's not anything
6661680	6667200	do you ever do food sex stuff like oh i tried that in my 20s because you know you see it in
6667200	6670800	like playboy videos or whatever and they're like oh let's get out the honey and the whipped cream
6670800	6678480	and then it's like okay yeah it took one time to i was like yeah this is gross you're like sticky
6678480	6682240	like who wants to i was like like if someone came up to you and said like hey do you want to eat a
6682240	6687920	hershey's kiss off of steve leavy's arm i wouldn't be like oh yeah i'm about to come so why would you
6687920	6693680	think that your your girlfriend would suddenly become sexy if she had whipped cream like like
6693680	6699280	now like like whipped cream is usually experienced in a contained environment it's on top of frozen
6699280	6704000	ice cream stuff you put it on a tit and then it's like now there's you get to see what you ever like
6704000	6710400	spill like soda on your like linoleum and then you don't get to it right away and then you walk
6710400	6719200	across it with your socks and it's got like dog hair on it now add cum that's that's what we're
