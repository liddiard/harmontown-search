0	24000	Welcome, one and all, to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
24000	36000	Hermit Town is now in session.
36000	45000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hermit Town, Mr. Dan Hermit.
45000	49000	Thank you. Wow.
49000	53000	Thank you for coming out on a holiday weekend.
53000	56000	All right, Jeff. We've got a lot to do tonight.
56000	58000	Let's get down to business, Hermit.
58000	62000	Okay, so, Society Corner.
62000	64000	Do you want a theme for that, or no?
64000	65000	You just want to jump in.
65000	66000	I think I got one handy.
66000	76000	Let's do Society Corner.
76000	78000	Some advice about how to run a society.
78000	80000	It's a corner where society lives.
80000	81000	Society Corner.
81000	82000	Society Corner.
82000	85000	Advice how to run society.
85000	87000	How to run a society.
87000	89000	It's a corner where the society lives.
89000	91000	It's called Society Corner.
91000	92000	Corner, corner.
92000	96000	Okay.
96000	97000	Yeah.
97000	99000	We've got them trained to expect less.
99000	100000	You guys understand the show is improvised.
100000	102000	We don't write this shit.
102000	106000	I know it comes off like a highly pomorous gem,
106000	109000	but this is completely just off the shit, off the cuff.
109000	114000	Okay, so, I'm making up no expressions.
114000	116000	It's off the shit.
116000	120000	Spencer, our dungeon master, came up with, and I were driving along.
120000	121000	Spencer is also my chauffeur.
121000	126000	He's my dungeon master chauffeur and B assistant,
126000	131000	as opposed to A assistant, not like apiary.
131000	132000	Is that right, apiary?
132000	133000	Is that B?
133000	134000	Okay.
134000	139000	But we came up with this when we were watching a fire truck drive by us,
139000	141000	and we were talking about, okay, there's fire trucks,
141000	144000	and they, you know, what is it like to be a fireman, you know?
144000	149000	And they sit in that station, and they wait for fire alarms.
149000	152000	And a lot of times, it's like somebody that's been hurt, you know?
152000	155000	They're the first response, often, the paramedics on board.
155000	158000	If somebody just, like, you know, loses a foot or something,
158000	160000	it's not on fire at all.
160000	161000	They're the first there.
161000	164000	So Spencer and I came up with a new pitch,
164000	166000	and if you're listening and you work for civic government,
166000	168000	please take this to heart.
168000	173000	Firefighters should leave for fires earlier
173000	177000	by not getting dressed at the station.
177000	181000	They should take their fire gear with them,
181000	184000	leave the station earlier, thereby increasing chances
184000	188000	of getting to a fire when it's smaller,
188000	192000	and if they need to get dressed, they can do it on site.
192000	195000	Same amount of time increase the chances of catching a fire
195000	197000	when it's smaller, and of course, there's the people
197000	199000	that lost a foot, and it's not on fire at all.
199000	202000	Just show up in a shirt and jeans, take care of it.
202000	203000	Is there a fire?
203000	205000	Oh, let's put on our rubber pants.
205000	208000	Now, the taxpayers would appreciate a good show.
208000	210000	Oh, they're getting in their rubber pants.
210000	212000	Don't do that in the station.
212000	213000	You don't know where you're going.
213000	214000	You don't know how big the fire is.
214000	216000	Get the fire truck over to the fire.
216000	218000	It might be tiny right now.
218000	220000	That's a very good idea.
220000	223000	Do you think that when the dispatch comes out for a call
223000	227000	and they go, hey, we got a guy, he has a broken foot,
227000	230000	they don't get full fire gear, do they?
230000	231000	I don't know.
231000	233000	I don't know how it works, but there's room for improvement.
233000	235000	In my mind, because you see them driving to things
235000	237000	and there's the hook and ladder and there's a dude in the back,
237000	240000	he has his pants on, but he has like a T-shirt on
240000	243000	with the suspenders, and you know why they wear those, right?
243000	245000	I think I've heard that.
246000	249000	But yeah, I think it's a very sound idea.
249000	250000	Okay.
250000	251000	All right.
251000	253000	So I don't know if you want to spend time
253000	254000	on this bartender concept.
254000	256000	We were talking to the green room.
256000	258000	We brought it up.
258000	260000	Last week we talked about, oh, wouldn't it be nice
260000	263000	to have what we're calling a bartender,
263000	266000	but that does not mean anything legally definable.
266000	268000	Yeah, it's not going to be a bartender.
268000	270000	We're worried about the idea that it might be illegal
270000	273000	in some way for meltdown, but we're not going to have
273000	276000	somebody up here serving drinks to the audience
276000	278000	and being paid for that service,
278000	281000	because that would be against the alcohol beverage commission.
281000	283000	Also, the person, and I'm not kidding about this,
283000	285000	they wouldn't be handling liquor at all.
285000	287000	They could just be an ice tender.
287000	288000	Ice tender?
288000	290000	Yeah, they could just put ice in the cups.
290000	292000	There's only one kind of booze up here.
292000	293000	So who's going to pour the vodka in?
293000	294000	No, we wouldn't have the vodka.
294000	296000	The hard part is the ice.
297000	299000	As we learned last week, we spent the whole...
299000	301000	No, the hard part is that it interrupts the show
301000	304000	when people are putting microphones down to deal with alcohol.
304000	305000	Ice.
305000	306000	It's the ice.
306000	307000	It's the ice?
307000	308000	Yeah.
308000	309000	It's easy to pour vodka into a cup.
309000	310000	I've done it a thousand times.
310000	311000	Do you think that...
311000	313000	It's hard to get the ice happening up here.
313000	315000	Would we get in legal trouble if somebody was over here
315000	317000	making me a vodka on the rocks?
317000	319000	Making you a vodka on the rocks?
319000	321000	That I don't know, but I know for sure it's totally legal
321000	323000	for someone to put ice in a cup and hand it to an alcoholic
323000	327000	who has his own designs on the cup, you know?
327000	328000	And they could still be a bartender.
328000	330000	It's just a bar of ice.
330000	331000	They don't have to be...
331000	334000	Then we sidestep all of the municipal issues.
334000	337000	Then you're gonna want to still stop and open up the bottle
337000	338000	and then pour it in?
338000	339000	It's not...
339000	340000	Okay, I think that...
340000	345000	I mean, this conversation is the putting ice in the cup of the evening.
348000	352000	I was just trying to help, like, make it faster.
352000	354000	I don't want anyone to get arrested.
354000	355000	I don't want, like...
355000	357000	I think we just have somebody make you drinks.
357000	358000	All right, okay.
358000	359000	You're a troublemaker.
359000	361000	We're not charging for it.
361000	362000	It's basically...
362000	364000	If Kumail came out here and said...
364000	366000	And you said, hey, Kumail, while I'm talking,
366000	368000	would you grab a cup, put some ice in it,
368000	370000	and throw a little vodka on top of it?
370000	372000	I don't think we'd get in trouble.
372000	374000	We're just meeting a new friend that's gonna do that service.
374000	376000	Okay, how do we meet that person tonight?
376000	379000	That's a conversation we have to have now.
379000	381000	Who traveled the farthest?
381000	383000	This guy.
383000	384000	Nashville?
384000	386000	Can somebody beat Nashville?
386000	387000	North Carolina.
387000	388000	North Carolina.
388000	389000	North Carolina.
389000	390000	South Florida.
390000	391000	Did I hear China?
393000	394000	South Florida?
394000	395000	Versus Australia, they have.
395000	396000	Australia.
396000	397000	Australia.
397000	398000	Australia wins.
398000	399000	Australia, get up here.
399000	400000	Yeah!
400000	401000	If you want.
404000	405000	Putsman!
408000	410000	If this is a stunt, you better be willing to fake
410000	412000	one of the hardest accents there is.
412000	414000	It's deceptively hard, mate.
415000	416000	I've tried it.
417000	418000	Crocodile, mate.
419000	421000	Come up here and grab a microphone.
421000	422000	Come on up here, young lady.
422000	423000	Grab yourself a mic.
423000	424000	What's your name?
425000	426000	My name is Sarah.
426000	427000	Sarah?
428000	430000	Say something with an Australian accent.
432000	434000	My name is Sarah and I'm from Australia.
434000	436000	You don't sound particularly Australian.
437000	438000	You came here from Australia?
439000	440000	Yeah, bloody earth I did.
441000	443000	But like, you came to the show from Australia
443000	445000	or do you live here for the last seven years?
446000	448000	No, no, I'm from Australia.
448000	449000	I'm going back there.
450000	452000	You came here for the show?
452000	453000	No, no.
455000	457000	Well, we wouldn't really want to live in that world.
458000	460000	Then this is a terrible show.
461000	463000	She came here in a 15-hour flight.
465000	468000	Sarah, one of my favorite things about Australians,
469000	470000	and I have a lot of Aussie friends,
471000	473000	is that they make the word N-O.
473000	475000	No, a three- or four-syllable word.
476000	478000	They say yes or...
478000	479000	No.
479000	480000	No.
481000	482000	That's good.
482000	484000	That's also always a question.
484000	485000	No.
485000	486000	That's very convincing.
486000	487000	That's a good Australian ID.
488000	490000	She's either Australian or she's Meryl Streep.
490000	491000	That's great.
492000	493000	In either case, welcome.
493000	494000	What was your name again?
494000	495000	Sorry?
495000	496000	Sarah.
496000	497000	Sarah, okay.
497000	498000	Where do you want a situator?
500000	502000	I think, for now, let's have her just seat
502000	504000	in that seat closest to the ice bucket, right?
504000	505000	Okay.
505000	508000	Maybe between Spencer's table and...
509000	510000	The one over there.
510000	512000	The stage right chair, Sarah.
513000	515000	You also offered to pay for this, right?
515000	516000	This is a paying gig.
516000	518000	Oh, sure. Let's see what I got.
520000	522000	I'll chip in, too.
523000	524000	What do we say?
524000	525000	Do we come up with a price?
526000	529000	Well, I said $100, but I meant Australian.
534000	536000	What is the exchange in the Australian dollar right now?
536000	537000	Do you know?
537000	539000	I just know that whatever you offer somebody there,
539000	541000	they say, that's not that currency,
541000	543000	and then they pull out a bigger form of currency
543000	546000	and say, that's that form of currency.
547000	549000	20, 40, 60, 80...
549000	551000	It's amazing that people still get that reference.
551000	554000	It's so funny the things that make it through the sandstorms
554000	555000	of time.
555000	557000	Sometimes I make references here,
557000	560000	like to the disco ball lady in dance hall days,
560000	561000	everyone's just stone-faced.
561000	564000	They're like, what are you talking about, grandpa?
565000	567000	But then for some reason, we're all going to just
567000	571000	permanently retain Paul Hogan's three-year stardom
571000	573000	in the United States.
573000	574000	It was very culturally impacted.
574000	575000	I only have $15.
575000	576000	Can I chip in that?
576000	577000	Yeah, I have like $80.
577000	579000	We're getting close to our mark.
579000	580000	All right.
581000	582000	Do I have this?
582000	583000	$80?
583000	584000	I have $17.
585000	586000	$85?
586000	588000	We're going to put that close to $100.
588000	589000	$95.
589000	590000	There you go.
590000	591000	That should be...
591000	592000	That's it.
595000	597000	$100.
597000	598000	Pay in advance.
598000	599000	All right.
601000	602000	Okay.
602000	605000	This show is like hitting the ground running.
605000	607000	Sarah, I'd like a drink.
609000	611000	He likes vodka on the rocks.
612000	614000	So let's see what happens.
614000	616000	Now we're allowed to just ask you for a drink, right?
616000	619000	It's not going to be a bully-ish thing for me to say,
619000	621000	Sarah, get off your ass and give me a drink.
621000	622000	No, yeah.
623000	624000	We own her now.
625000	626000	We've subjugated her.
626000	629000	That's the easiest $100 anyone's going to make.
629000	630000	Yeah.
630000	632000	I'm going to make it fucking so hard on you, Sarah.
633000	636000	You're going to wish you never moved from Australia to here.
636000	638000	You're going to wish you said, nah.
642000	643000	All right.
643000	644000	So I don't know what...
644000	646000	I mean, I don't know how long we can continue to delay this.
646000	650000	We have a superstar in the wings tonight.
650000	653000	We have an internet superstar.
653000	654000	Do we really?
654000	655000	Yeah.
655000	656000	I was backstage.
656000	657000	I didn't see any.
659000	660000	I forgot.
660000	662000	We do have a nascent...
662000	666000	A man that might have changed social media for good.
666000	667000	Yeah.
667000	669000	I guess let's just bring him up and get to it.
669000	676000	Please welcome the inventor of what salon.com calls shrobbing, Rob Shrob.
690000	691000	Thank you, Sarah.
691000	692000	Huh?
692000	693000	Gorgeous.
693000	694000	Perfect.
694000	695000	Sarah, so sweet.
695000	696000	She brought me a vodka in the rocks,
696000	698000	and she wanted to make sure that it was to my liking.
698000	701000	It has equal parts vodka and ice.
702000	703000	So, shrob.
703000	704000	Yes.
704000	705000	Davis.
706000	710000	What started as you haranguing our producer, Dustin Marshall, on Twitter,
710000	714000	or Instagram, by just...
714000	715000	I got good at it.
715000	716000	You got really good at it.
719000	723000	Take us through the rich history that is shrobbing.
723000	726000	Like, how do we get to this place where salon's writing?
727000	729000	A very Woodford...
729000	732000	Woodford and Bernstein's-esque article.
732000	734000	It really got to the bottom of it.
734000	736000	Yeah, or not.
736000	738000	I'll give you another choice.
738000	743000	You can explain why when you woke up during your colonoscopy
743000	746000	that you chose to pretend to stay asleep.
748000	749000	Wait, what?
749000	751000	Let's talk about either of these things.
751000	753000	Okay, I'll talk about the colonoscopy.
753000	754000	Okay, all right.
755000	757000	Because I don't really know an answer to that.
757000	758000	Your question.
758000	761000	Yeah, I mean, it started off as a thing and then became...
761000	765000	But also, the shrobbing phenomenon, if we can call it a phenomenon,
765000	767000	which I believe now we can, right?
767000	771000	I'm not going to make that bold of a statement.
771000	775000	What blows my mind about shrobbing is that everybody now tries to shrob a shrob.
775000	776000	You can't...
776000	777000	Can't shrob a shrob.
777000	778000	You can't shrob a shrob.
778000	779000	Can't do it.
779000	781000	But also, it seems like an easy bit.
781000	782000	Seems easy.
782000	783000	But everybody does it wrong.
783000	786000	Deceptively, it's like the Australian accent.
786000	789000	You also said that a lot of people, because the headline of the article
789000	793000	was like the king of trolls, that there's a lot of people just trying to now...
793000	795000	De-throw me by...
795000	797000	They'll tweet to me and it's like,
797000	799000	Hey, shrob, you're a piece of shit.
799000	801000	Why don't you go kill yourself?
801000	803000	Try saying smart to that.
803000	804000	Didn't think so.
804000	810000	I didn't become the king of trolls, I'm quote, air quotes.
810000	814000	King of trolls by de-throwing the other king of trolls.
814000	817000	There was no guy before you that was like Johnson-ing.
817000	819000	Yeah, there's that prison yard rules.
819000	822000	You don't take down the troll.
822000	823000	You do it.
823000	824000	You put in the hours.
824000	827000	You work hard.
827000	830000	And you're just a business.
830000	832000	You're a work-a-day troll.
832000	833000	Yeah, yeah.
833000	834000	No, you do put a lot of elbow grease in there.
834000	835000	Self-taught.
835000	836000	How many followers...
836000	838000	Did you gain like a silicon followers because of this?
838000	843000	I had like 15,000.
843000	846000	Thank you.
846000	849000	It was one person wins 15,000.
849000	858000	And then after like the podcast, I went up like to 20,000.
858000	859000	I got like 19 now.
859000	862000	It's just 5,000 people telling you to go fuck yourself.
862000	863000	Yeah, in like two weeks.
863000	865000	All right, colonoscopy.
865000	867000	Okay, what do you want to know?
867000	869000	They put a camera up your butt.
869000	871000	They sedate you before they do that.
871000	872000	Yes.
872000	874000	I was recently in for an endoscopy.
874000	875000	That's the other way.
875000	878000	These kids will learn all about this stuff soon enough.
878000	881000	It becomes de rigueur, I believe the phrase is.
881000	883000	Now they want to check out your tuchus.
883000	887000	They put a camera up there, a little robot, a little Mars Rover.
887000	888000	They sedate you.
888000	891000	They want to put you under.
891000	893000	The anesthesia didn't take.
893000	896000	It took right away.
897000	901000	The nurse goes, okay, you should start feeling a little dizzy.
901000	906000	And I'm like, I really don't feel and then I was gone.
906000	910000	And then what I'm going to say is probably halfway through the procedure,
910000	917000	I start waking up and I open up my eyes and there's a big screen in front of me
917000	921000	because I'm laying on my side and the screen is there because on the other side,
921000	925000	the doctor's like sticking this up my butt.
925000	929000	And I get to see what's inside my butt.
929000	933000	This was the poster for the Truman Show, remember?
933000	938000	And in my brain, my brain goes, you should say something.
938000	945000	And then I imagine myself saying something like going, I'm still awake.
945000	950000	And it just sounded like begging to be made fun of.
950000	952000	That's your concern in that moment.
952000	957000	Rob, you're a director. You could just say cut.
957000	960000	Moving on. Check the gate.
960000	962000	I mean, really check the gate.
962000	964000	But I was going to say something.
964000	966000	I was going to say something.
966000	970000	But then another voice in my head said, no, wait.
970000	975000	I want to see if these guys are going to talk shit about me.
975000	980000	So I kept my eyes closed and I just I sat there.
980000	984000	And then actually I told this conversation to my dad who I, you know,
984000	987000	like the next day because he said, so how did it go?
987000	990000	I woke up in the middle of it, Dad.
990000	998000	Oh, the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.
998000	1002000	We're on speakerphone in Kate's car because we're driving to Topanga.
1002000	1004000	I woke up in the middle of it, Dad.
1004000	1006000	And he goes, oh, that must have been weird.
1006000	1009000	You know something? It wasn't that bad.
1009000	1013000	I just silence. Just just maybe.
1013000	1016000	OK.
1016000	1017000	Wasn't that bad?
1017000	1020000	Your dad was in the Navy, right? Too close to home, maybe.
1020000	1022000	Probably.
1022000	1024000	This is where he met my mom.
1024000	1026000	You can tell him I said that.
1026000	1029000	He's a fan of yours.
1029000	1030000	I just am amazed.
1030000	1035000	How much of it do you think had to do with the chemical reaction in your brain?
1035000	1040000	Like, how high do you think you were and how lucid do you think you were
1040000	1044000	making a decision like, I'm waking up in the middle of the American public's
1044000	1048000	worst medical nightmare, which is failed anesthesia,
1048000	1051000	which happens once at 10,000 times.
1051000	1059000	And you're waking up, and you make a decision based on, like, peer pressure.
1059000	1061000	I'm paranoia, probably.
1061000	1068000	You want to know whether or not people make fun of your intestines behind your back.
1068000	1070000	Yeah.
1070000	1073000	I would be curious to know what kind of shit they might talk.
1073000	1079000	Look at this guy's fucking lower, fucking cold. Oh, my God.
1079000	1082000	He taco bell much?
1082000	1087000	Like the twist and turns, like, oh, we got a Scotland highway here.
1087000	1089000	Scotland.
1089000	1092000	Someone's going to Glasgow.
1092000	1094000	Yeah, I mean, come on.
1094000	1095000	Come on.
1095000	1099000	I mean, if you work at a restaurant and, you know, you're a waiter and you come back
1099000	1102000	in the kitchen, you go, man, table eight.
1102000	1104000	What a bunch of dickheads.
1104000	1106000	Hey, we should spit in his colon.
1106000	1110000	Yeah.
1110000	1113000	Hey, wake up. It's great. Oh, thanks.
1113000	1115000	Shit.
1115000	1121000	He knows I didn't tip him. I should have done that.
1121000	1124000	Rob, do you want a drink from Sarah from the Outback?
1124000	1127000	I'll have a, yes.
1127000	1130000	Could I kettle one on the racks?
1130000	1133000	Thank you, Sarah.
1133000	1136000	No, no, we pay her. We pay her. Don't get out your wallet.
1136000	1137000	I'm going to tip her.
1137000	1141000	Now that this gets into the illegal right now, if it's money.
1141000	1147000	Oh, shit. I only got a hundred.
1147000	1151000	No, it's a receipt from El Pollo Loco.
1151000	1156000	And by the way, I mean, he keeps acting like that shopping thing in salon was like no big deal.
1156000	1157000	No big deal.
1157000	1161000	He was texting and he was like, I was like, you fucking asshole.
1161000	1164000	I hope you're happy. And he's like, this is all I ever wanted.
1164000	1169000	And then he texted me later and said, Jessica Alba is following me now.
1170000	1176000	Jessica Alba, I'm meeting Jessica Alba's social media assistant probably is following, was following me.
1176000	1178000	I noticed at one point, I'm sure that made you very jealous.
1178000	1181000	So you texted me. Jessica Alba is following me now.
1181000	1183000	And Valerie Bertinelli.
1183000	1186000	Valerie Bertinelli? You mean Queen of the Trolls?
1186000	1191000	Yep. That's who I took down.
1191000	1194000	Valerie Bertinelli, you think you're so cool? Fuck off.
1194000	1198000	Take it. That's what I'm going to do.
1198000	1203000	This one guy, this one guy, like right after the podcast was like, like, was shropping me.
1203000	1207000	It was like going, oh, what is this?
1207000	1210000	Did it like three times in a row and failed every single time.
1210000	1216000	And then like the fourth one, he was, your bit's getting old.
1216000	1218000	He ran out of gas on you. Yeah. Yeah.
1218000	1220000	I was like, I went out. I was at work.
1220000	1223000	And then I noticed like this train of this guy, like every 15 minutes.
1223000	1227000	And then on the fourth tweet, your bit's getting old.
1227000	1229000	I think you've got to get some new material, buddy.
1229000	1233000	They're like, okay. After four times.
1233000	1237000	Is the book deal, is it going to be, what's your book going to be called?
1237000	1241000	What is this book called? Humblebrag.
1241000	1244000	Does the crown weigh heavy on the King of the Trolls?
1244000	1247000	So heavy. A lot of responsibility.
1247000	1251000	And my fingers are so aching from.
1251000	1254000	I'm so familiar that Camille's not here tonight because he will be.
1254000	1256000	I think Camille hates me right now.
1256000	1257000	Oh yeah. Camille. Yeah.
1257000	1261000	I think he absolutely, I've been texting him and writing him.
1261000	1264000	Hey, Guardians of the Galaxy. It's like one o'clock.
1264000	1265000	What do you think?
1265000	1269000	Nothing. Usually you would be like, hey, we're going to see Star Trek into darkness.
1269000	1272000	Come on. Whatever. Not anymore.
1272000	1274000	He's kind of busy.
1274000	1277000	Busy, not liking me.
1277000	1285000	Well, I'm kind of eager to bring Spencer out because there's also a new segment I'd like to do with him.
1285000	1288000	Do you think that would be okay to bring him out this early?
1288000	1290000	It's never too early to bring Spencer out.
1290000	1292000	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
1304000	1307000	Spencer, don't mix up those purses.
1307000	1308000	Hey, what?
1308000	1310000	Don't mix up those purses.
1310000	1312000	I'll fucking kill you, man.
1312000	1314000	Don't mix them up.
1315000	1317000	Two purses.
1317000	1320000	Are you live-shroving right now?
1322000	1323000	What is that?
1323000	1326000	Can I just be topped off with ice, Sarah?
1326000	1328000	I don't actually need more vodka.
1328000	1329000	Or maybe a little bit more.
1329000	1330000	Spencer, have you met Sarah?
1330000	1333000	Yeah, yeah. I met on the way up.
1333000	1335000	And the way down.
1335000	1337000	You don't really drink, though, do you, Spencer?
1337000	1338000	No.
1338000	1340000	Would you like a drink while we have Sarah?
1340000	1344000	No, no. I'll go bad.
1344000	1347000	I'll just spoil immediately.
1348000	1351000	Spencer, I brought you up early because you mentioned something in the green room
1351000	1355000	when I was like, okay, stop. Save it for the stage.
1356000	1362000	To catch us up, stop me if I start to become insensitive about this.
1363000	1365000	That's an option?
1365000	1370000	Did you hear about this?
1370000	1372000	I haven't been on the show in a while.
1372000	1373000	We would have no...
1373000	1376000	Stop him if he becomes insensitive.
1377000	1380000	The G.I. Jeff would have been a different story.
1381000	1383000	Stop me if I talk too much.
1387000	1393000	Since you've joined our family, Spencer, your parents have broken up.
1393000	1394000	Yeah.
1394000	1398000	As we've discussed in the past, you kind of felt like maybe you were the glue
1398000	1400000	that was holding them together.
1400000	1402000	Yeah, you know, I've long theorized that.
1402000	1403000	And then you moved out.
1403000	1406000	We've watched Spencer grow up from a young waif,
1406000	1410000	an urchin in the back of the Apple star.
1410000	1418000	He's now a producer and I think a hanger about in the writer's room.
1418000	1423000	Writer's room and like...
1423000	1425000	Also an unlicensed bartender.
1425000	1428000	Yeah, you may... Oh, yeah, constantly getting me drinks.
1428000	1432000	I mean, it's... But you moved out of your parents' house
1432000	1434000	and then they immediately went their separate ways.
1434000	1437000	It was pretty immediate.
1437000	1440000	And the last time we saw your dad, he was bounding up from the audience
1440000	1442000	and he was like, hey, it's me, Spencer's dad.
1442000	1445000	Oh, yeah, Spencer has testicles.
1446000	1450000	So the thing is, so now your parents have gone their separate ways
1450000	1453000	and this is not unfamiliar to me.
1453000	1456000	When I was like 10, my parents had a little separation year.
1456000	1457000	Yeah.
1457000	1462000	But you're much older than that and this seems more permanent than theirs.
1462000	1466000	But much like my parents, they've kind of like...
1466000	1469000	Now you're watching your parents kind of like do their own thing.
1469000	1470000	Yeah.
1470000	1476000	So your dad has gone to Central America?
1476000	1480000	Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's in Columbia right now.
1480000	1483000	And so I sent that to Erin and she was like, is he going to be okay?
1483000	1486000	It's like the kidnapping capital of the world.
1486000	1490000	Like, sorry if you're a Colombian Harman Town fan.
1490000	1492000	Also don't get kidnapped.
1492000	1493000	It's safer there now.
1493000	1494000	Okay, thank you.
1494000	1497000	We got a Colombian update.
1498000	1500000	So your dad, and now you told me in the green room,
1500000	1503000	you said your dad is sending you updates, like newsletters.
1503000	1508000	And man, he sends these emails and started out just like,
1508000	1511000	hey, Spencer, just wanted to let you know I got off the plane okay.
1511000	1514000	My phone exploded, but then it was fine again.
1514000	1517000	Or like, you know, whatever, I stubbed my foot.
1517000	1518000	Do you stub a foot?
1518000	1519000	I don't know.
1519000	1523000	But he would just send me little things.
1523000	1527000	But then it turned into this, like, Christmas style newsletter
1527000	1530000	that would just happen and the email, like,
1530000	1533000	the list of recipients got longer and longer.
1533000	1537000	And there's people that I'm pretty sure are just my little brother's friends
1537000	1542000	that, like, receive this newsletter.
1542000	1546000	Is it just called, like, Mike Smith's?
1546000	1550000	They're all cleverly titled individually.
1550000	1552000	But there's no title for the actual thing.
1552000	1556000	No, each of them is like its own beautiful vignette, if you think about it.
1556000	1557000	Example.
1557000	1563000	He had an email that was like, oh, I fell asleep getting a haircut.
1563000	1565000	Never fall asleep in Colombia.
1565000	1568000	How about never fall asleep getting a fucking haircut?
1568000	1571000	That's an insane person thing to do.
1571000	1574000	I fall asleep getting haircuts all the time.
1574000	1575000	That's crazy.
1575000	1579000	You have a lot of faith in your, I was going to say your opponent,
1579000	1581000	your bartenders.
1581000	1582000	Bartender?
1582000	1583000	Your bartender.
1583000	1584000	What do you call it?
1584000	1585000	A barber?
1585000	1586000	A stylist?
1586000	1587000	A salonist.
1587000	1588000	I don't call him a bartender.
1588000	1590000	I call him a bartender.
1590000	1591000	Maybe this is my problem.
1591000	1594000	No, but your barber, you don't count.
1594000	1597000	Man, your neck's going to be moving all around.
1597000	1599000	You don't fall asleep stock still.
1599000	1603000	Last time, the haircut you're currently looking at, I was fast asleep during.
1603000	1604000	I exploded in.
1604000	1607000	Apparently, my neck was not flapping around.
1607000	1608000	Or maybe it was.
1608000	1611000	Maybe you just got an iron neck or something.
1611000	1613000	I mean, I wouldn't be surprised.
1613000	1616000	That's what the ladies say.
1616000	1620000	I have a general rule.
1620000	1626000	I never travel anywhere where one of the rules is don't fall asleep.
1626000	1629000	Well, I don't know if the rule is actually don't fall asleep.
1629000	1633000	I think the only places that that's applicable in pop culture are the asylum
1633000	1636000	where Freddy Krueger survivors live.
1636000	1638000	Is he in Medellin or Bogota?
1638000	1639000	What's he doing?
1639000	1641000	I think he's closer to Bogota.
1641000	1642000	Is he on a vision quest?
1642000	1643000	Is he doing ayahuasca?
1643000	1644000	I wish.
1644000	1647000	That'd be so respectable.
1647000	1649000	He's trying to get by.
1649000	1651000	It's cheaper to live there.
1651000	1652000	He's teaching English.
1652000	1654000	Oh, so he's gone there, not just for kicks.
1654000	1656000	He's gone there to make his way in the world.
1656000	1657000	Yeah, yeah.
1657000	1660000	He wants to eventually get a job.
1660000	1664000	I'm one of those TV companies stationed out there.
1665000	1666000	He used to work in TV.
1666000	1667000	That's admirable.
1667000	1668000	That's very cool.
1668000	1669000	It's certainly interesting.
1669000	1671000	What's your mom doing?
1671000	1672000	She's holding up.
1672000	1673000	Burn.
1673000	1674000	She's...
1681000	1682000	This is the perfect...
1682000	1686000	I want to get a T-shirt, like a Rob Schwab, like a Schwabbing T-shirt
1686000	1689000	that says, what is this T-shirt?
1689000	1691000	Or what T-shirt is this?
1691000	1694000	And then on the back it says, who is Rob Schwab or something?
1694000	1696000	Remember when Rob used his own technique
1696000	1698000	to promote the found crap thing?
1698000	1701000	He said, when is this thing I'm promoting for the thing?
1701000	1702000	All right, anyways.
1702000	1706000	I was going to say, you've become Rip Taylor.
1706000	1708000	But before we move on to your mom...
1708000	1709000	Yeah.
1709000	1711000	He's pantomiming confetti.
1711000	1713000	It's better with confetti.
1713000	1715000	You can't just...
1715000	1719000	Before you answer about your mom,
1719000	1721000	I just want to ask about your dad.
1721000	1723000	Are you trying to get off her mom?
1723000	1724000	Yes.
1724000	1726000	I thought of that earlier.
1726000	1728000	I didn't get an opportunity to say.
1728000	1730000	Do you think your dad probably, I would guess,
1730000	1733000	he probably, not to flatter us, but he probably is listening, don't you think?
1733000	1735000	Maybe, I mean, you never know.
1735000	1736000	What else is he doing down there?
1736000	1738000	I really don't want to flatter him.
1738000	1740000	Yeah, I mean, well, he's always having adventures.
1740000	1742000	It's kind of amazing.
1742000	1745000	Spencer, do you want to fire off, assuming he's listening,
1745000	1746000	which he most certainly is,
1746000	1748000	do you want to fire off a missive to him right now?
1748000	1751000	I don't know who you're sending all these fucking,
1751000	1753000	how many people you're sending these emails to,
1753000	1755000	but it's kind of ridiculous.
1755000	1756000	So, all right.
1756000	1757000	That was it?
1757000	1758000	Yeah.
1758000	1759000	Oh, okay.
1759000	1760000	This is how our communications go.
1760000	1762000	They're very matter of fact.
1762000	1763000	All right.
1763000	1764000	All right.
1764000	1765000	You, yeah.
1765000	1768000	Ring in your recipient list.
1768000	1771000	It's offensive to all the people that you are sending it to.
1771000	1772000	Or have to...
1772000	1773000	Just make them feel like a piece of shit.
1773000	1775000	Yeah, I have to scroll past it all and get to the, you know.
1775000	1777000	I'm on the list for certain, like, people.
1777000	1778000	That's an L.A. thing.
1778000	1782000	A lot of times it's like an actor will just send out a newsletter
1782000	1786000	that's like, Steve's Daily Gazette.
1786000	1787000	Or Monthly Gazette.
1787000	1788000	Yeah, yeah.
1788000	1790000	It's like, it's been a weird month for Steve.
1790000	1796000	I found a lot of solace in the documentary Chocolate Man.
1796000	1798000	It's the story of a thing.
1798000	1800000	He'll just talk about what he's been watching.
1800000	1802000	And it's like, it's addressed to,
1802000	1804000	and I want to say to, like, Steve, like, you know,
1804000	1808000	have the balls to tell your grandma you love her.
1808000	1810000	Don't send her a fucking newspaper,
1810000	1814000	because she's the only one who gives a shit about any of this,
1814000	1816000	and you're treating her like a fucking plebe.
1816000	1817000	True.
1817000	1820000	Like, just email your grandma and say, I love you.
1820000	1822000	Thank you for taking an interest in my shit.
1822000	1823000	Yeah.
1823000	1824000	Everyone else is like, Steve's...
1824000	1825000	What?
1825000	1826000	What is this?
1826000	1827000	Yeah.
1827000	1828000	He had an audition for The Shield?
1828000	1830000	What the fuck has he taught?
1830000	1832000	That's canceled.
1832000	1834000	Have you seen...
1834000	1836000	Have you seen Chocolate Man?
1836000	1838000	So true.
1838000	1840000	I mean, I've seen it.
1840000	1842000	I'm assuming you've seen Chocolate Man.
1842000	1843000	It's riveting.
1843000	1844000	Yeah.
1844000	1846000	It's, I mean, the guy can't keep...
1846000	1853000	The sad thing is that he can't keep a pet dog.
1853000	1857000	Like, he loves dogs, but his livelihood is chocolate.
1857000	1859000	And they just keep dying on him.
1859000	1860000	Wait, wait.
1860000	1862000	Why can't Chocolate Man have a dog?
1862000	1864000	Chocolate is poisonous to dogs.
1864000	1866000	But only really dark chocolate.
1866000	1870000	But Chocolate Man deals in dark, dark chocolate.
1870000	1871000	And he loves dogs.
1871000	1873000	But no one will pay him to love dogs.
1873000	1875000	So it becomes...
1875000	1877000	As the New York Times said,
1877000	1881000	it becomes an unwitting expose of dog culture.
1881000	1886000	What starts as a chocka journey.
1886000	1887000	Dumb.
1887000	1888000	Stupid.
1888000	1890000	That's not a play on words.
1890000	1891000	That's not a play on words.
1891000	1893000	The New York Times is not what it used to be.
1893000	1894000	Yeah, no, no, no.
1894000	1895000	It's just a block now.
1895000	1897000	I remember that guy that reviewed the podcast.
1897000	1899000	He's like, Aaron's got a poo cast.
1899000	1902000	Kumail Nanja-Johnson is doing great.
1902000	1905000	Jim Davis is funny as always.
1905000	1907000	That's the New York Times.
1907000	1908000	It's really weird.
1908000	1911000	And Salon will just do an article of a shrah.
1911000	1912000	I know.
1912000	1916000	Clearly they're running on vapors out there.
1916000	1919000	A couple other websites too.
1919000	1920000	Oh yeah?
1920000	1922000	Does the story have legs?
1922000	1923000	Did it catch fire?
1923000	1924000	Did it make it to TMZ?
1924000	1927000	I sent you another article.
1927000	1929000	I texted you.
1929000	1931000	Most of the time when you text me something,
1931000	1935000	I'll click on it and it's just a dude with two dicks in his mouth.
1935000	1937000	Only two dicks?
1937000	1938000	Yeah.
1938000	1940000	Shrahb's not what he used to be.
1940000	1944000	I was a three dick guy back in the day.
1944000	1948000	I'm so lazy to do the work.
1948000	1950000	By the way, I didn't retweet the Salon article.
1950000	1953000	I'm very proud of you, but I'm really conflicted about it.
1953000	1957000	I boycott Salon because of that weird, I don't know,
1957000	1959000	they did a weird hatchet job on Patton Oswalt
1959000	1961000	and I don't think that kind of stuff should be rewarded.
1961000	1962000	No.
1962000	1965000	It was just a weird, I'm not clicking on it.
1965000	1967000	What was the tweet that he did that got their dandruff?
1967000	1968000	Who knows?
1968000	1969000	Whatever it was, it was ironic.
1969000	1975000	You don't get more progressive and not racist than Patton Oswalt.
1975000	1977000	He doesn't give a fuck about it.
1977000	1978000	He's a comedian.
1978000	1981000	He's been making people laugh for a really long time.
1981000	1984000	Patton, as far as I know, is one of the most flagrant bigots
1984000	1987000	I've ever had in my life.
1987000	1988000	I don't even want to talk about it.
1988000	1991000	I'll get my dander up and then my dander will be up.
1991000	1992000	Don't do that.
1992000	1994000	Keep that dander down, man.
1994000	1998000	I prefer it to be dripping into my cup.
1998000	2000000	I don't know why I'm looking at this anymore.
2000000	2002000	Let me see if there's anything else on here.
2002000	2005000	Did I ever tell the story about Suck and Dick?
2005000	2007000	Mmm.
2007000	2009000	Davis.
2009000	2011000	No, you did not.
2011000	2014000	Please continue.
2014000	2015000	Heads down.
2015000	2016000	Keep scrolling.
2016000	2020000	I do not have that honor.
2020000	2022000	Chaplin does.
2022000	2023000	I wrote it.
2023000	2026000	The night is young.
2027000	2035000	Did I ever tell the story that one time a friend of mine,
2035000	2037000	it's kind of like a super hacker,
2037000	2040000	he let me know that my iCloud account had been hacked,
2040000	2043000	and that's why now I use this one password thing,
2043000	2046000	like this app, because I was using really easy passwords,
2046000	2050000	and he let me know, yeah, we're tracking this guy.
2050000	2052000	He set up a thing.
2052000	2056000	He hacked people's cell phones and high profile people,
2056000	2060000	and they traced back this whole operation that this guy had set up,
2060000	2062000	and it started with Cameron Diaz's cell phone.
2062000	2064000	Thank you.
2064000	2067000	Two cell phones away from Cameron Diaz.
2067000	2069000	I'm not in her cell phone,
2069000	2072000	but someone who is in Cameron Diaz's cell phone has my number.
2072000	2075000	Probably Ben Stiller from 18 years ago.
2075000	2076000	All right.
2076000	2077000	Not a good story.
2077000	2078000	Sorry about that.
2078000	2079000	I thought it was interesting.
2079000	2080000	Put it in my Evernote.
2080000	2081000	That was the whole story?
2081000	2083000	Yes, yes, yes.
2083000	2085000	I want to know about the dick sucking.
2085000	2086000	Yeah.
2086000	2088000	Why'd you drop that?
2088000	2091000	Do you want to have that honor?
2091000	2093000	Do you want to be honored?
2093000	2095000	Rob, would you honor Dan?
2095000	2097000	I would love to.
2101000	2102000	What does that mean?
2102000	2105000	Is there ever been a podcast where two straight guys just started sucking dick?
2105000	2109000	I think they wouldn't be straight guys if that happened.
2110000	2112000	Well, I guess it is.
2112000	2114000	Two straight guys could suck a dick.
2114000	2116000	Especially, you know.
2116000	2119000	Sucking dick for an audience.
2119000	2120000	For a cause.
2120000	2121000	Yeah, for a cause.
2121000	2124000	If you do it to raise awareness of something.
2124000	2127000	Unless it's to raise awareness of sucking dick.
2127000	2131000	To raise awareness of how much you like a dick in your mouth.
2131000	2134000	Then that's not charity.
2135000	2139000	Hello to all our homosexual listeners.
2139000	2140000	How are you?
2140000	2141000	We believe you're human.
2141000	2144000	We value your listenership.
2144000	2145000	I'm sorry.
2145000	2149000	I think that was implicit until you said that weird disclaimer.
2149000	2152000	That was a weird apology.
2152000	2156000	Also, the word homosexual is the new Afro-American.
2156000	2158000	It sounds kind of weird on the tongue, doesn't it now?
2158000	2159000	Homosexual.
2159000	2162000	Weird on the tongue.
2162000	2164000	You know what else feels kind of weird on the tongue?
2164000	2166000	Rob dick.
2166000	2169000	What do you say now instead of homosexual?
2169000	2170000	Gays?
2170000	2172000	Well, I don't know.
2172000	2173000	It's weird.
2173000	2174000	It's not that it's a bad word.
2174000	2176000	It doesn't sound kind of clunky now.
2176000	2179000	Are you saying it's kind of a mouthful?
2188000	2190000	I don't know why I keep looking at my phone.
2190000	2192000	I don't have anything on here anymore.
2192000	2195000	Because there's pictures of dicks on it.
2195000	2201000	I don't like fundraising at the office, unless it's for charity.
2201000	2204000	What in the segway is going on?
2204000	2206000	That was the last thing on my phone.
2206000	2208000	So like book drives?
2208000	2210000	Listen to me.
2210000	2212000	I'm not opposed to it.
2212000	2213000	I'm not telling you to stop doing it.
2213000	2214000	Here's what I'm saying.
2214000	2215000	I think it's weird.
2215000	2218000	I think we have accepted something as normal that's very weird.
2218000	2221000	I think that we all work at offices and office environments,
2221000	2224000	and we're all pretty familiar with the fact that every once in a while
2224000	2228000	someone comes to the office and they'll just kind of announce
2228000	2232000	that their niece, Katie, is going to Scotland to play soccer
2232000	2234000	or learn to play the trumpet or something.
2234000	2236000	Nothing to do with any disease or anything.
2236000	2239000	It's just like some kid is going to do something,
2239000	2243000	and then everyone at the office is kind of subtly pressured
2243000	2245000	to buy a KitKat or something.
2245000	2248000	I just think it's really weird that we accept this as common behavior.
2248000	2250000	I'm assuming your office may name Starburns?
2250000	2254000	Well, I'm not complaining about anyone that works for me right now.
2254000	2256000	People come in and say, hey, my daughter's going on a trip
2256000	2258000	and everybody's pony up.
2258000	2260000	By applause, how many people have been in an office
2260000	2262000	where this has happened?
2262000	2264000	Smattering.
2264000	2266000	That's a well, well...
2266000	2268000	That was easily 1,100 people.
2268000	2271000	It happens outside of the grocery store, too.
2271000	2273000	You ever notice this?
2273000	2275000	You ever see one of these?
2275000	2278000	You're going into the grocery store?
2278000	2282000	Rob, are you about to break into one of your patented universal comedy bits?
2282000	2285000	Yeah, you're walking in and you see them,
2285000	2288000	and then what you do, you pull out your phone.
2288000	2290000	Ooh, I'm checking a text and you...
2290000	2292000	Right by, man.
2292000	2295000	No, I will not have a chocolate bar.
2295000	2298000	No, I do not want that.
2298000	2300000	I'm looking at my phone.
2300000	2302000	I walk too fast.
2303000	2307000	I told you the story about the guy that came to my door, my house,
2307000	2309000	and he had a baseball cap on it.
2309000	2312000	He had kind of a Kevin James sort of build.
2312000	2315000	So very fit and lean.
2315000	2319000	And he rang my doorbell, and I came out,
2319000	2322000	and I said, of course I'm in the middle of something.
2322000	2324000	No one is ever sitting in a glass chamber
2324000	2326000	waiting to interact with a stranger at their door.
2326000	2328000	So that's another thing.
2328000	2332000	If your hobby or vocation involves costing strangers,
2332000	2335000	try to remember you're in the middle of their lives,
2335000	2338000	not the other way around.
2338000	2340000	All right. Oh, Sarah, okay. Sorry.
2340000	2343000	We're new at this. Sarah went to jump a drink,
2343000	2345000	and I let it derail the show.
2345000	2347000	Are you okay with this? I'm so sorry.
2347000	2349000	She's making $100.
2349000	2352000	She's already made it. She could walk out the door right now.
2352000	2354000	She could just disappear into the night,
2354000	2356000	and she would have $100 still.
2356000	2358000	Yeah, we saw Crocodile Dundee, too.
2358000	2360000	Not only can she leave, she can go somewhere
2360000	2363000	that even cartels can't get her.
2363000	2366000	She could put, like, bats in bags
2366000	2368000	and throw them on our campfire,
2368000	2371000	and we'd be like, ah, curumba!
2371000	2373000	Did that happen? Yeah.
2373000	2375000	Sarah, you've already made your money, Sarah.
2375000	2377000	If at any point you want to just disappear, you're allowed to.
2377000	2380000	You're not beholden to stay up here on stage,
2380000	2382000	although we would love you to stay.
2382000	2384000	I think her date applauded that.
2384000	2387000	No, I think she is beholden. We gave her 100 bucks.
2387000	2390000	She's got to give us 50 if she leaves.
2390000	2392000	All right.
2392000	2394000	What kind of crazy...
2394000	2397000	I'm just saying, it's not endangered servitude.
2397000	2399000	I mean, if you wanted it that way,
2399000	2402000	we'd say we'll give you $100 at the end of the show.
2402000	2404000	I'm going to give you $20 to please sit down,
2404000	2407000	because you're making me feel bad.
2407000	2412000	He's paying you $20 to devalue my $100.
2412000	2414000	What kind of crazy...
2414000	2418000	I put $17. You paid $83, whatever.
2418000	2419000	Right.
2419000	2420000	All right, Sarah.
2420000	2424000	I mean, you're free to go. I'm not going to be Sauron.
2424000	2427000	No, I think stay.
2427000	2429000	Do what you want. Yes, keep it.
2429000	2431000	Keep it. Keep it.
2431000	2432000	Also...
2432000	2434000	Keep my guilt money.
2434000	2436000	The reason why I feel bad is because we have a woman on stage
2436000	2438000	and she's not talking at all.
2438000	2441000	As always, there's a bunch of dudes sounding off,
2441000	2443000	and we have a gal on stage.
2443000	2445000	Give her a microphone, Dan.
2445000	2447000	I...
2447000	2449000	This microphone costs $15.
2449000	2450000	Yes.
2450000	2453000	What's like a good Aussie, like,
2453000	2456000	bar drinking... bar song?
2460000	2462000	How about the person I asked?
2462000	2464000	Is there like an Aussie toast?
2464000	2466000	Like a famous cheers?
2466000	2469000	Like a poem or a rhyme or anything like that?
2469000	2472000	It would be Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, and then everyone goes...
2472000	2474000	Oi, oi, oi, oi.
2474000	2476000	Didn't they do that on The Man Show
2476000	2477000	when Kimball was on there?
2477000	2479000	Did they do some kind of thing like that?
2479000	2481000	Yeah, we got it in Mexico. People knew it.
2481000	2482000	Is that right?
2482000	2483000	Yeah.
2483000	2484000	I love that. It's nice.
2484000	2485000	What part of Australia are you from?
2485000	2486000	Melbourne.
2486000	2487000	Melbourne.
2487000	2489000	I went there once. It was quite lovely.
2489000	2491000	It's very funny people, very nice.
2491000	2493000	Is it true about the toilets?
2495000	2497000	Is that an urban legend, or is that true?
2498000	2500000	That they're full of poo?
2500000	2503000	No, that they swirl in opposite directions.
2503000	2507000	How long did that take before somebody figured it out?
2507000	2510000	You know, because they're living on the other side of the world,
2510000	2514000	and then, I mean, like, somebody would have had to have, like,
2514000	2518000	gone to the bathroom, stared at the toilet,
2518000	2520000	went, ooh, counter-clockwise,
2520000	2523000	and then jumped on a plane, flew to America,
2523000	2524000	and then immediately did a...
2524000	2526000	Dan, are you pouring yourself a drink right now?
2526000	2528000	Yeah, you guys freed our indentured servant.
2528000	2531000	No, she stayed up here. She had a job to do.
2531000	2533000	Put that ice back in the bucket.
2534000	2536000	Here, I'll take the ice.
2536000	2537000	Put the ice back.
2537000	2538000	I'll take the ice.
2538000	2540000	No, let her do it. We fucking paid her.
2540000	2541000	I'll take the ice.
2541000	2542000	I'm so fucking confused.
2542000	2546000	This is exactly what was happening in America in 1848.
2548000	2551000	Like, there's a lot of, like, we...
2552000	2555000	Look, it's to our discomfort
2555000	2557000	that it happened to be a woman that came up and was like,
2557000	2559000	God, you wouldn't be bothered by this at all.
2559000	2560000	No.
2560000	2561000	I wasn't bothered with it.
2561000	2564000	I love throwing money at people and just, like,
2564000	2566000	that's what I do with Spencer.
2567000	2568000	Easy, easy, easy, easy.
2568000	2569000	Everybody wins.
2571000	2573000	Adam, sit the fuck down.
2573000	2575000	Adam? Adam, sit down.
2575000	2578000	I'll pay you $20 to shut the fuck up.
2578000	2580000	No, I don't have any more money. Get away.
2582000	2583000	Get away from me.
2583000	2584000	I like a lot of ice.
2584000	2586000	What the home audience doesn't know right now,
2586000	2587000	the listener doesn't know.
2587000	2589000	Adam is hiding behind a beam right now.
2591000	2593000	And he's holding a vial.
2595000	2597000	He's wrapped around a pillar like the snake in...
2597000	2600000	Like the water bottle in the end of 12 Monkeys?
2600000	2602000	Am I mistaken, Adam, or...
2602000	2604000	I don't want to bring you up on stage. I really don't.
2604000	2606000	And Adam, I say this with all due respect.
2606000	2607000	I love you.
2608000	2610000	Not as due, but all is offered.
2611000	2613000	I do like you, Adam.
2613000	2616000	But when Abed on the last show was up here,
2616000	2619000	were you losing your mind because you got out-ass-burgered?
2619000	2620000	Yes.
2620000	2621000	Yes.
2621000	2626000	Because you were firing off, like, quips and fucking non-sequiturs, like...
2627000	2631000	You couldn't believe there was a guy on stage that was weirder than you.
2632000	2634000	You feel nose evil.
2635000	2637000	You're out of a job.
2637000	2638000	Yeah, right now.
2638000	2640000	But why are you standing?
2640000	2641000	I'm so well lit.
2643000	2645000	Now you're kneeling in the aisle.
2645000	2647000	Someone took your chair.
2648000	2649000	What are you doing, Adam?
2649000	2650000	Quick, run, everybody.
2653000	2655000	The entire audience.
2655000	2656000	Run away.
2657000	2659000	We'll meet back in 20 minutes.
2659000	2664000	Adam, you're the only person that's standing poised to charge the stage.
2670000	2671000	There we go.
2671000	2673000	I mean, but I'm not giving up my mic stand.
2674000	2675000	Thank you, Adam.
2675000	2677000	You were trying to liberate her genius.
2677000	2678000	Yes.
2678000	2679000	Fantastic. Thank you, brother.
2679000	2680000	Adam Goldberg, everyone.
2682000	2684000	I'm not clapping.
2684000	2685000	No, I'm not clapping either.
2685000	2686000	And I have a mic stand.
2686000	2687000	I could clap all day.
2690000	2692000	My lack of clap means something.
2694000	2695000	Sorry about Adam.
2695000	2696000	Have you ever listened to the show?
2696000	2697000	Do you know what's happening?
2698000	2699000	Yes, I have listened to it before.
2699000	2700000	Okay.
2700000	2704000	I thought, I don't know if maybe like there was like a wayward poaching expedition.
2704000	2708000	You got tranqed, darted and stuck in a crate and now you're here and you're like.
2710000	2712000	Do kangaroos really box?
2715000	2716000	Is that a thing?
2716000	2718000	Yeah, there's some really tall kangaroos.
2718000	2721000	And when they get up on their hind legs, they're like six foot tall.
2721000	2724000	And if you make them angry, they will punch you in the face.
2724000	2725000	With their front paw.
2725000	2726000	With their boxing gloves.
2726000	2728000	That's like a natural thing they'll do?
2728000	2729000	Yeah, because they get up.
2729000	2730000	Like this.
2730000	2731000	And they're like really, really high.
2731000	2733000	And if you can't give them, then they're like.
2733000	2734000	Wow.
2734000	2737000	And people mistake them for like giant mice.
2737000	2738000	Yeah.
2738000	2739000	Well, I mean.
2739000	2742000	No, no, no.
2742000	2743000	Only.
2743000	2745000	Holy cow, look at that giant mouse.
2745000	2747000	It's as big as a kangaroo.
2747000	2748000	I think only.
2748000	2749000	I think only.
2749000	2750000	Giant mouse.
2750000	2754000	Only Sylvester the cat from the cartoons.
2754000	2755000	I thought I wanted a giant mouse.
2755000	2756000	This is why I'm there.
2757000	2758000	Oh, Father.
2758000	2761000	Here's a fun thing to ask our foreign guests.
2761000	2767000	Pop culturally, like what is what is something that is on TV in Australia
2767000	2772000	that's like very like kind of home brewed Australian entertainment pop culture
2772000	2775000	that is like every Australian kind of knows.
2775000	2780000	But that once you leave those waters, like you find that it just drops off
2780000	2782000	entirely like it's just like this Australian thing.
2782000	2785000	Is this you trying to find out if they watch community in Australia?
2785000	2786000	No, no, no, no.
2786000	2789000	That's that's that's a transnational export from a conglomerate.
2789000	2792000	I'm saying like I was like, like transnational from Montreal.
2792000	2794000	I'll go like lickety dick, toodle dick.
2794000	2797000	And you're like, what are you talking about?
2797000	2798000	Like, you know, the little dicks.
2798000	2801000	And you're like, what the fuck are the little dicks?
2801000	2804000	It's a you know, and it's like I always find this really amazing.
2804000	2806000	I hear about these things.
2806000	2808000	Is there something like that?
2808000	2809000	Yes.
2809000	2811000	There's TV shows like Kath and Kim.
2811000	2812000	And Kim.
2812000	2815000	They did an American version of which to translate.
2815000	2817000	There's a movie called The Castle.
2817000	2818000	Yeah.
2818000	2821000	So that's like everyone in Australia can quote that movie.
2821000	2824000	Like from what's the movie The Castle about?
2824000	2829000	It's about this family small suburban town.
2829000	2834000	Why do you hold your mic to your face to make that distracting sound?
2834000	2836000	It's about a small suburban.
2836000	2837000	So it's yes.
2837000	2841000	What is the movie Castle?
2841000	2843000	It's not about a castle.
2843000	2844000	It's not.
2844000	2845000	Okay.
2845000	2846000	Go ahead.
2846000	2847000	Okay.
2847000	2848000	What is it about?
2848000	2849000	It's like a typical.
2849000	2851000	Where do they live?
2851000	2853000	They don't live in a castle.
2853000	2855000	It's a metaphor.
2855000	2859000	It's a metaphor, you fucking eight year old.
2859000	2862000	And also there's a movie called The Castle in the States.
2862000	2865000	And it's not James Gandolfini in a prison.
2865000	2867000	It's against Robert Redford.
2867000	2868000	All right.
2868000	2870000	Stop yelling at me.
2870000	2871000	You shouldn't.
2871000	2874000	Next time you wake up and there's a camera up your ass.
2874000	2875000	Say.
2875000	2876000	Excuse me.
2876000	2878000	Excuse me, madam.
2878000	2880000	I happen to be conscious.
2880000	2883000	Could you please give me more whatever you put in here.
2883000	2888000	If I woke up in the middle of a procedure where they told me beforehand I was supposed to be asleep.
2888000	2891000	I would fucking start making a lot of noise.
2891000	2895000	Rob Rob Rob thinks you have to have a monocle and a top hat and be British.
2895000	2899000	It's such a fancy thing to say your ass raping me.
2900000	2902000	It's so fancy.
2902000	2903000	I would just say.
2903000	2905000	I wouldn't want to be pretentious.
2905000	2911000	I paid a lot of money to be asleep for the next 12 hours and I'm awake during the thing.
2911000	2918000	I would feel like it's just a good idea to say I'm awake and put me back to sleep.
2918000	2921000	I should have just started screaming as loud as I could.
2921000	2925000	Then they would have been, oh shit, fucking get him.
2925000	2927000	Fill him up.
2927000	2930000	Dump the shit on him. Make him go to sleep.
2930000	2933000	What's the castle about? It's about a small family.
2933000	2934000	They live in a little...
2934000	2937000	Mark Castle can't make it through college.
2939000	2942000	Until he met a friend.
2942000	2945000	Dress up like two women.
2945000	2948000	Mate, I got the perfect apartment.
2949000	2951000	But there's a catch.
2951000	2954000	We gotta dress up as koalas.
2955000	2957000	Now wipe out.
2963000	2965000	This is going to be great.
2965000	2966000	This is going to be great.
2966000	2968000	What's Castle about?
2969000	2970000	Please continue.
2970000	2971000	What's it about?
2971000	2973000	It sounds like a great show.
2974000	2978000	It's just about a family, like a nuclear family living in a normal suburban town.
2978000	2979000	They love their house.
2979000	2981000	It's like everything's their castle.
2981000	2982000	Then a...
2982000	2983000	Really?
2983000	2984000	Yes.
2984000	2987000	And then a...
2987000	2989000	A big airport company.
2989000	2991000	I don't know the word.
2991000	2992000	Qantas.
2992000	2994000	They get Qantas.
2994000	2998000	Come along and say basically we need to knock down your house because we need to build a runway.
2998000	2999000	And you have no choice in the matter.
2999000	3001000	What's the name of the airport?
3001000	3003000	Castle Airlines.
3003000	3004000	Drawbridge?
3004000	3005000	I don't think...
3005000	3007000	There's certain jokes.
3007000	3013000	That's what I'm doing.
3013000	3014000	I'm redefining the word.
3014000	3018000	Does the father of the house make a stand and go like you're not taking my fucking house?
3018000	3019000	That's awesome.
3019000	3020000	See?
3020000	3021000	It's a good show and you're missing.
3021000	3022000	All right.
3022000	3023000	Great.
3023000	3024000	Next show.
3024000	3025000	Okay.
3025000	3026000	What's Squigglepuss about?
3026000	3027000	No.
3027000	3028000	I'm going to end up a show.
3028000	3029000	Made up a show.
3029000	3031000	I want to know about Lickle Dicks.
3031000	3034000	Dan, did you see the pilot of Lickle Dicks?
3034000	3035000	There was a thing.
3035000	3039000	I dated a Canadian a long time ago and she in the middle...
3039000	3041000	She was like, clickety-click barba trick.
3041000	3042000	It was like the Barbapappas.
3042000	3044000	That's what it's called for our Canadian listeners.
3044000	3045000	Barbapappas?
3045000	3047000	Canadian listeners will know what I'm talking about.
3047000	3048000	There's a cartoon called the Barbapappas.
3048000	3053000	But, you know, like Io, you would reference Scooby-Doo and she'd be like, what's that?
3053000	3056000	And then you could just make up anything about Scooby-Doo you wanted.
3056000	3060000	They'd be like, yeah, well Scooby-Doo is this dog and he was a ghost.
3060000	3061000	So he haunted them?
3061000	3062000	Yeah.
3062000	3066000	Because the dog haunted them and told them to solve crimes or else he'd kill them.
3066000	3069000	Because you'd just find out she doesn't have...
3069000	3072000	But then she would go like, oh, it's like a Barbapapa.
3072000	3074000	That's a real thing, Barbapapa.
3074000	3077000	They were like these blobs that would turn into bulldozers.
3077000	3078000	All right.
3078000	3081000	Oh, I've seen that.
3081000	3085000	I like when you go through like a Canadian airport and you just look at the corner,
3085000	3090000	there's a TV in the corner, there's like a purple dog with a unicorn horn going like,
3090000	3093000	and that solves that.
3093000	3096000	And you're like, this isn't foreign language.
3096000	3098000	It's amazing that I've never seen this.
3098000	3100000	It's just like it's done with all the polish.
3100000	3104000	They have their own little Gilligan's Island up there.
3104000	3108000	They're making radios out of coconuts and cartoons about purple ducks.
3108000	3116000	Is there a radio station in Australia?
3116000	3118000	I'm almost certain there's several.
3119000	3122000	The Boomerang coming back with the hits from the...
3122000	3123000	That's what I mean.
3123000	3124000	That's what I mean.
3124000	3126000	You know what I'm talking about.
3126000	3129000	Put your hits on the bobby.
3129000	3131000	Here's Phil Collins.
3131000	3134000	What does Slick Rick and Batman talk about in the morning?
3134000	3136000	It's like a morning zoo team.
3136000	3138000	What is their catchphrase?
3138000	3140000	Slick Rick and Batman.
3140000	3143000	Slick Rick and Batman coming at you.
3143000	3145000	We're better than two cups of coffee.
3145000	3146000	Come on.
3146000	3147000	Bob, you be Batman.
3147000	3149000	Dan, you be Slick Rick.
3149000	3150000	Can I?
3150000	3151000	Can I?
3151000	3152000	Can I?
3155000	3157000	O.J. Simpson.
3157000	3159000	Not getting any breaks this morning.
3159000	3162000	Don't know what's going on with that.
3162000	3164000	Boy.
3164000	3170000	If you're driving to Sydney today, stay off the three.
3170000	3173000	What's the three all about?
3173000	3174000	Oh, Reggie.
3174000	3177000	We'll be back with Reggie later, but first...
3177000	3179000	Here's an update about the...
3179000	3181000	The pinch at the pump.
3189000	3191000	So answer the question.
3191000	3192000	Sorry.
3192000	3196000	So Slick Rick is not the rapper Slick Rick from the 80s.
3196000	3198000	No, they don't know about that.
3198000	3199000	No, no, no, no.
3199000	3201000	It's spelled without the C.
3201000	3202000	All right.
3202000	3205000	So is there like a radio team?
3205000	3207000	Yes.
3207000	3209000	I knew it.
3209000	3212000	Is it two guys?
3212000	3213000	It depends.
3213000	3215000	There's different type of radio stations
3215000	3217000	and there's different demographics.
3217000	3218000	Example.
3218000	3219000	I don't know.
3219000	3220000	It's hard to say.
3220000	3222000	But yeah, generally two guys is pretty common.
3222000	3223000	Yeah.
3223000	3226000	You don't know any names off hand, like...
3226000	3229000	Tubesock and...
3229000	3232000	Like Monkey Whistler.
3232000	3234000	No, they don't have like DJ or radio names.
3234000	3236000	It's just like Matt and Joe.
3236000	3237000	Joe and Matt.
3237000	3239000	We're more advanced.
3239000	3240000	We're so much more advanced.
3240000	3243000	Sarah, what is the antipodean fascination
3243000	3244000	with giving everybody a nickname?
3244000	3246000	So if your name is Jeff, you're Jeff-o.
3246000	3247000	All right.
3247000	3249000	Sarah, do you have a nickname, right?
3249000	3250000	What do they call you?
3250000	3252000	Bertie.
3252000	3253000	Bertie?
3253000	3254000	Bertie?
3254000	3255000	Bertie.
3255000	3256000	Bertie.
3256000	3257000	My last name's Bert, so Bertie.
3257000	3258000	Bertie.
3258000	3261000	Yeah, everybody has to have a diminutive nickname, right?
3261000	3262000	Yeah, that's...
3262000	3263000	Like Steve Allen.
3263000	3264000	Yeah, I don't know why they do that.
3264000	3267000	I think it's just more casual and we just like to be casual, so...
3267000	3268000	Oh, fuck.
3268000	3269000	Wait a minute.
3269000	3270000	Wasn't there a zoo team in...
3270000	3271000	Was it Australian?
3271000	3272000	Those guys that called...
3272000	3276000	There was like a scandal where they called and pretended to be a friend of the...
3276000	3278000	And it was a horrible thing that happened.
3278000	3281000	Like they did a prank about...
3281000	3283000	There was the royal baby in England
3283000	3285000	and they pretended to be a nurse or something like that
3285000	3287000	or talked to a nurse.
3287000	3288000	What did...
3288000	3290000	It went like this.
3290000	3294000	My cuff link managed to hit a button.
3294000	3295000	That's true.
3295000	3297000	It's a pretty sad story.
3297000	3301000	Basically, there was two DJs and they called up the hospital
3301000	3303000	where Kate Middleton was giving birth
3303000	3304000	and they got through to a nurse and they said,
3304000	3306000	oh, we're the queen or someone.
3306000	3307000	I don't know who they said.
3307000	3309000	And they said, oh, what's happening?
3309000	3310000	And she was like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3310000	3314000	And gave all this information and then they aired it
3314000	3317000	and then the nurse killed herself.
3317000	3318000	What?
3318000	3319000	And she left a note saying...
3319000	3320000	Yay, media.
3320000	3321000	Because of...
3321000	3322000	Did she gave up the good?
3322000	3323000	Well, she was humiliated.
3323000	3324000	She was humiliated.
3324000	3326000	Thought she would lose her job, get in big trouble
3326000	3330000	and she left a note saying that these DJs basically had to take care of her family now
3330000	3331000	and it was their fault.
3331000	3332000	Whoa.
3332000	3333000	Yeah.
3333000	3334000	And they've only...
3334000	3336000	I think only one of them has just gone back to work like over a year later.
3336000	3339000	And he's like very trepidatiously his first day of work.
3340000	3344000	It's a squeaker in the morning.
3344000	3348000	Looks like it's a high of 68.
3348000	3351000	Bit less of a pinch at the pump bed.
3354000	3355000	Whoa.
3357000	3358000	Looks...
3358000	3361000	Here's Phil Collins.
3364000	3365000	Yeah.
3365000	3371000	It's funny to ask because everyone that was affected was on some island.
3371000	3374000	We got our own problems over here.
3374000	3377000	That's horrible for everyone involved.
3377000	3378000	I remember that.
3378000	3379000	That stuck out.
3379000	3380000	And I thought...
3380000	3381000	What really stuck out was that they were Australian.
3381000	3382000	They weren't even like...
3382000	3384000	Because really honestly and not to admit like...
3384000	3389000	It's very easy when something horrible like that happens to like jump on whoever was immediately
3389000	3391000	like, well, what were you guys thinking?
3391000	3394000	But they were thinking, we're Australian DJs.
3394000	3396000	We shouldn't be able to get away with any of this.
3396000	3398000	And they were kind of like trying to do a prank.
3398000	3400000	I'm not sticking up for anybody or...
3400000	3402000	Yeah, whatever.
3402000	3404000	Everyone's on their edge of their seats.
3404000	3408000	Who's Dan in favor of in this story?
3408000	3410000	The baby.
3410000	3411000	Oh, no.
3411000	3415000	I was just going to say that apparently in their defense they said they didn't want it aired.
3415000	3418000	And it wasn't their decision in the end to some higher up.
3418000	3419000	Oh, nice.
3419000	3420000	The suits did it.
3420000	3421000	Yep.
3421000	3425000	Is it true you guys drive in the middle of the road?
3425000	3426000	Yes.
3426000	3427000	Yes.
3427000	3430000	Where does the other side of the road go?
3436000	3440000	When they turn right, like they turn so far right that they go left.
3440000	3442000	Like it goes around.
3442000	3443000	All right.
3443000	3444000	Anyways.
3444000	3448000	It's getting close to D&D hour.
3448000	3451000	I want to bring out my lovely fiancé who almost didn't make it tonight.
3451000	3453000	Erin McGathey.
3467000	3468000	Hello.
3468000	3469000	Hello.
3469000	3470000	Hi.
3470000	3472000	Oh, there's another mic.
3472000	3474000	I was told there was a mic on a chair.
3474000	3475000	Yep, yep, yep.
3475000	3476000	Nice.
3476000	3477000	All right.
3477000	3479000	Thank you for having me at this town meeting.
3479000	3480000	No problem.
3480000	3481000	Excited.
3481000	3482000	You know we're going to the moon, right?
3482000	3483000	I heard.
3483000	3484000	I heard.
3484000	3486000	I learned how to play a didgeridoo last night.
3486000	3487000	Oh, cool.
3487000	3488000	Yeah.
3489000	3491000	Good night, everybody.
3491000	3493000	Erin, don't be racist.
3493000	3498000	Well, that's really offensive to Australian people because you're supposed to use those
3498000	3504000	to call your clan to fight for you.
3504000	3506000	And then we just think it's like our instrument.
3506000	3507000	Yeah.
3507000	3513000	And we're like, and they're like, who wants to fight?
3513000	3515000	It's like a false alarm every time.
3515000	3516000	They come over.
3516000	3518000	They get on a Qantas flight and they come over.
3518000	3519000	I heard the wah-wah.
3519000	3522000	And we're like, no, we were just having a party, man.
3522000	3523000	It's burning, man.
3523000	3524000	Yeah.
3524000	3525000	Well, thank you, mate.
3525000	3532000	I learned while in a pool, soup very sober.
3533000	3536000	My friend was holding it down for me to play.
3536000	3537000	That's how I learned.
3537000	3538000	How was it?
3541000	3542000	That's the wrong way.
3542000	3543000	Photoshop.
3545000	3546000	Yeah.
3546000	3547000	It was a lot of fun.
3547000	3552000	Also on the way home in our car, there was like an hour, or not an hour, but a half hour
3552000	3555000	where everyone in the car got really good at our Australian accents.
3555000	3556000	And then we started to lose it.
3556000	3558000	Can I hear you're a really good Australian accent right now?
3558000	3559000	Yes.
3560000	3561000	Jeff.
3562000	3563000	Talk to Sarah.
3563000	3564000	Sarah?
3565000	3567000	No, no, I can't do it.
3568000	3570000	No, that was a deaf Australian person.
3570000	3571000	That was a deaf Australian person.
3571000	3572000	More!
3573000	3574000	Betty.
3574000	3575000	Betty.
3579000	3580000	Come over later.
3580000	3583000	We're going to make pizzas on the barbie.
3584000	3590000	And we're going to talk about Joe, because he's been surfing all the time.
3591000	3593000	And we're proud or concerned?
3595000	3597000	Sarah, scale of one to ten.
3597000	3598000	How was that?
3598000	3599000	Was that a passable accent?
3599000	3600000	It was English.
3602000	3603000	That's fair.
3603000	3604000	Not bad.
3605000	3608000	Does anybody really have a barbie in Australia?
3608000	3609000	Or is that just like...
3609000	3611000	Also, they don't call them shrimps, they call them prawns.
3611000	3612000	You don't put a shrimp on a barbie.
3612000	3615000	Yeah, they don't call them shrimps, they call them prawns.
3616000	3617000	Knock it off.
3617000	3618000	Why are you doing that?
3619000	3620000	I'm sorry.
3620000	3621000	Am I right, Sarah?
3621000	3622000	You don't say a shrimp on the barbie.
3622000	3623000	You don't say a prawn.
3623000	3624000	Erin.
3624000	3627000	Yeah, no, my dad's never put a shrimp on the barbie, ever.
3627000	3628000	It's a prawn.
3628000	3629000	Wow, that's a dad fact.
3629000	3630000	Or even a prawn, no.
3630000	3633000	Did you guys collectively say, okay, let's stop doing it,
3633000	3636000	because that's all we're hearing every time we go over there.
3637000	3638000	Yeah, it's a bit cliched now.
3638000	3639000	We're just like, oh.
3639000	3641000	I was like, you don't barbecue a shrimp,
3641000	3643000	but you guys don't even call them shrimps, you call them prawns, right?
3643000	3644000	Prawns, yeah.
3644000	3646000	Yeah, we've been over this.
3646000	3647000	Erin.
3647000	3648000	Yes, Rob?
3648000	3651000	Erin, what songs did you learn on the didgeridoo?
3652000	3656000	I learned slow rumbling wind.
3657000	3661000	I learned mummy opening his mouth.
3663000	3665000	I learned despair.
3666000	3669000	And I learned, hey, ricola.
3669000	3671000	That's something different.
3671000	3673000	That's an alpha and horn.
3673000	3675000	Well, you play it the same way.
3675000	3677000	It's the same song, different instrument.
3677000	3678000	Is that right?
3678000	3684000	Yeah, you have to relax your lips like they're not part of your face.
3684000	3685000	I'll teach you.
3685000	3687000	So you have to relax your lips,
3687000	3690000	and then you blow air through your lips like a trumpet.
3691000	3692000	Get up on the mic.
3692000	3694000	Get up on the mic there.
3694000	3695000	Great podcast.
3695000	3701000	I'm assuming the answer is no, but it'd be so cool if it was yes.
3701000	3706000	Is there an Australian cinematic hero from the 80s
3706000	3709000	who comes down to Australia,
3709000	3712000	and he's not familiar with Australian ways,
3712000	3717000	but he plays a banjo, and he's like,
3718000	3721000	he's always eating hot dogs,
3721000	3724000	and then he's walking around Melbourne,
3724000	3726000	but he doesn't get it, and people are like,
3726000	3727000	give me your wallet.
3727000	3730000	And he's like, whoa, that's a knife.
3730000	3732000	That really is a knife.
3733000	3735000	This is a smaller knife.
3735000	3736000	That's all I have.
3738000	3743000	Because he's the equivalent of the crocodile Dundee.
3744000	3748000	Do you think it's cool that all super-villains want Australia
3748000	3751000	when they join forces with aliens?
3753000	3754000	Do what?
3755000	3757000	Man, what's her problem?
3760000	3763000	Lex Luthor in the original Superman movie,
3763000	3765000	the list goes on and on.
3767000	3768000	Is your family from Australia?
3768000	3770000	Were your parents also from there?
3770000	3772000	No, they moved there in the 80s.
3772000	3773000	They're from the Irish.
3773000	3774000	Irish?
3775000	3776000	Interesting.
3776000	3777000	Can we hear your Irish accent?
3777000	3778000	Yeah, let's do that.
3780000	3783000	Sarah and Erin, I want you guys to have an Irish conversation together.
3784000	3785000	Or contest.
3793000	3795000	Specifically 80s Irish, though.
3796000	3799000	Let's get magical, magical.
3802000	3807000	You know, the song that I started the show with was from Xanadu,
3807000	3809000	which is, you know, Olivia.
3809000	3810000	Thank you.
3811000	3813000	I was talking to Sarah, but you're welcome.
3813000	3816000	My wife lived next to Olivia Newton-John.
3816000	3817000	Is that right?
3817000	3818000	Yes.
3818000	3822000	I was on a cruise ship one time doing a comedy show and I was like 25
3822000	3826000	and there were these two girls that walked like in the middle of the night
3826000	3829000	onto the pool deck and into the jacuzzi.
3829000	3832000	And I was like, oh my God, these are the most beautiful girls in the world.
3832000	3835000	Then I realized, okay, probably well underage.
3835000	3837000	They were like 15, 16 years old.
3837000	3840000	So I was like, okay, these are little girls.
3841000	3844000	Then a woman comes out, hotter than them by a mile.
3844000	3845000	It was the mother.
3845000	3846000	It was Olivia Newton-John.
3846000	3848000	She was fucking dead, sexy.
3848000	3849000	She was like, Olivia.
3849000	3850000	Bam.
3850000	3851000	Bam.
3852000	3854000	So anyway, I'm fucking Olivia Newton-John.
3855000	3857000	And I mean fucking her.
3859000	3860000	All right, let's try it.
3860000	3861000	What?
3861000	3862000	Batty.
3862000	3863000	This is Irish?
3863000	3865000	That I'm doing Australian.
3865000	3866000	No, no, no.
3866000	3867000	Not your Irish.
3867000	3868000	It was Irish.
3868000	3871000	Oh, I thought Birdie was going to do Irish and I was going to do Australian.
3871000	3873000	You're both going to do Irish.
3873000	3874000	We're both going to do Irish.
3874000	3875000	Yeah.
3875000	3876000	Okay.
3876000	3877000	Go.
3878000	3879000	Birdie.
3881000	3882000	Fucking cool.
3885000	3886000	Aaron.
3887000	3888000	Birdie, hi.
3889000	3890000	Oh, dear.
3891000	3894000	I was sitting outside the school today.
3897000	3905000	And I saw a man that looked very sad in a suit, staring at the children.
3906000	3907000	Shit.
3914000	3917000	He reaped of vodka and repetition.
3918000	3922000	Were there yellow moons, green clovers, blue stars?
3923000	3926000	No, what did you think about that, Birdie?
3926000	3937000	I don't think he was a dad of any of the kids, no.
3938000	3942000	He didn't look like he had any sparkle in his eye.
3947000	3949000	I don't know how to do an Irish accent.
3952000	3953000	That sounded like one, maybe.
3953000	3954000	Maybe I was projecting.
3954000	3956000	Yeah, discretion is a better part of valor.
3956000	3957000	I love that about you, sir.
3959000	3961000	Where's me gold?
3963000	3964000	Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
3965000	3968000	Oh, it's me, McSeinfeld.
3968000	3969000	Jerry McSeinfeld.
3969000	3974000	Oh, have you ever noticed that your clovers are never in the washing machine?
3978000	3980000	What's up with rainbows?
3981000	3984000	How many purple hearts do you need?
3985000	3987000	Isn't that for Vietnam?
3988000	3989000	What kind of luck is that?
3989000	3993000	If you got a purple heart, it means you got bad luck, not good.
3994000	3996000	I just noticed these things.
3998000	4008000	Now, Dan, would you give me a Korean Johnny Carson?
4008000	4009000	This is going to be bad.
4009000	4011000	Korean Johnny Carson.
4024000	4026000	South Korean Johnny Carson.
4026000	4027000	South Korean.
4028000	4030000	Have you noticed?
4030000	4041000	I drive down Burbank today.
4042000	4044000	You sound like Mr. Brainwash.
4044000	4045000	Yeah.
4046000	4049000	It was so hot in Burbank.
4049000	4051000	How hot was it?
4051000	4059000	I noticed a bird noticed eating worms and spit it out so hot.
4062000	4064000	Russian Johnny Carson.
4070000	4074000	In Burbank, monologue, do you.
4074000	4084000	This is the worst show I've ever been a part of.
4085000	4087000	Black Popeye.
4088000	4091000	Let's just make sure I'm in TMZ tomorrow.
4091000	4093000	Give me some Black Popeye.
4093000	4095000	Black Popeye.
4095000	4097000	Black Popeye.
4097000	4099000	Black Popeye.
4099000	4101000	I'm not doing Black Popeye.
4101000	4104000	Okay, stop one more.
4105000	4107000	American Indian Roseanne Barr.
4109000	4113000	Native American Roseanne Barr.
4117000	4119000	Canadian Mr. T.
4121000	4123000	Hey, fool.
4124000	4128000	I pity the fool that don't care about their mother.
4132000	4135000	Ah, cah, cah, cah, cah, motherfucker.
4136000	4137000	Black Popeye.
4138000	4139000	Whoa.
4139000	4141000	Stuck in a Black Popeye over the plate.
4142000	4143000	Not cool.
4144000	4147000	Let's say that there was a movie called Black Popeye.
4147000	4151000	And Robert Altman made it, and it was the full cast.
4151000	4153000	But Popeye was black.
4153000	4155000	Who would be the cast?
4155000	4158000	Curtis Fiddy Cent Jackson as Popeye.
4158000	4159000	As Popeye.
4160000	4161000	Olive Oil.
4163000	4164000	Iggy as Azalea.
4164000	4165000	Jada Pinkett.
4166000	4168000	Jada Pinkett as Olive Oil.
4168000	4169000	Black Olive Oil.
4169000	4171000	Tiny Lister as Brutus.
4171000	4172000	That's good.
4173000	4174000	What's his name?
4174000	4175000	Bluto.
4175000	4176000	Tiny Lister.
4176000	4177000	Yeah, if he's still got it.
4177000	4178000	Tiny Lister, yeah.
4178000	4179000	Still got it.
4179000	4180000	Never lost it.
4180000	4181000	Who's Poop Deck Happy?
4182000	4183000	Morgan Freeman for sure.
4183000	4184000	Morgan Freeman is fucking Bluto.
4184000	4186000	Are you talking now or then?
4186000	4187000	What?
4187000	4188000	Oh then, I guess.
4188000	4189000	Red Fox.
4189000	4190000	Red Fox?
4190000	4191000	Oh, Red Fox.
4191000	4193000	We could sell this tomorrow.
4194000	4196000	If it were 30 years ago.
4196000	4197000	Exactly.
4198000	4199000	Alright, so.
4199000	4200000	We could sell this yesterday.
4200000	4203000	Alright, so you'd be Red Fox as Poop Deck Pappy.
4203000	4204000	No, no, no.
4204000	4205000	I'm not gonna do that.
4206000	4209000	Jeff, please do all the characters.
4209000	4210000	Hispanic Hogan's heroes.
4213000	4214000	Hogan, you dick.
4216000	4217000	Alright, great.
4219000	4221000	Yo, you locked us up here, Holmes.
4221000	4222000	Fucking let us out, dick.
4224000	4226000	I know something.
4229000	4230000	I don't know why he would know more than this.
4230000	4231000	Alright, okay.
4232000	4233000	Jump down your pit.
4233000	4234000	I'm sorry, Davis.
4234000	4235000	Eskimo Hitler.
4236000	4237000	Eskimo Hitler?
4239000	4240000	Eskimo Hitler.
4240000	4241000	Eskimo Hitler.
4249000	4250000	He's cold, but he's mad.
4250000	4251000	He's really cold.
4251000	4252000	He's cold, but he's mad.
4253000	4254000	Alright, well.
4256000	4257000	Welcome to the...
4257000	4258000	Puerto Rican...
4259000	4260000	Churchill.
4261000	4263000	I feel like my heart is shivering.
4263000	4264000	I'm getting nervous.
4264000	4266000	Give me some Puerto Rican Churchill.
4266000	4269000	Speak softly, Holmes, and carry a big stick, Holmes.
4269000	4271000	That's Roosevelt, you fucking learn.
4271000	4272000	Alright, fine.
4272000	4274000	Alligator Lincoln.
4275000	4276000	Alligator...
4276000	4278000	Abraham Lincoln, but he's an alligator.
4278000	4279000	Alligators.
4279000	4280000	He's an alligator.
4280000	4281000	As an alligator.
4282000	4285000	Four score.
4289000	4297000	It's seven eggs ago.
4297000	4298000	Seven eggs ago?
4298000	4300000	How do you think crocodiles measure time?
4301000	4302000	Alligators.
4303000	4304000	Alright, Sarah.
4306000	4307000	Give me...
4309000	4310000	I want...
4311000	4312000	Let's see.
4312000	4313000	Dan, give her one.
4313000	4314000	Give Sarah one.
4314000	4315000	Throw one on her.
4316000	4319000	Elvis as a robot.
4322000	4323000	Robot Elvis, Sarah.
4326000	4327000	Okay.
4329000	4330000	I don't know.
4331000	4332000	Go for it.
4333000	4342000	Sarah, just say, you ain't nothing but a hound dog and a robot voice.
4343000	4345000	You are no longer a hound dog.
4345000	4346000	Yeah!
4347000	4349000	That was actually just a really good Elvis.
4349000	4350000	Yeah.
4350000	4351000	Alright.
4351000	4354000	Okay, so we should probably roll into the D&D.
4354000	4355000	What do we got?
4355000	4356000	We got everybody we need.
4357000	4359000	We should probably say good night to Sarah.
4359000	4360000	No, Rob, you got to play D&D.
4364000	4365000	She was a bartender.
4365000	4367000	She's walking around like 200 bucks.
4367000	4368000	I thought I was...
4368000	4369000	She can stay.
4369000	4370000	We can bring somebody else to play.
4370000	4372000	I thought I was going to help Spencer tonight.
4373000	4377000	Well, right now we should have enough people for D&D in general, right?
4377000	4379000	I mean, four players.
4379000	4382000	We talked in the green room about Rob being the Dungeon Master's helper.
4383000	4386000	I don't think that Spencer was involved in that conversation.
4387000	4389000	No, I think it would be cool.
4390000	4391000	Let's try it out.
4391000	4393000	Rob as Spencer's assistant.
4393000	4395000	Well, then we'd need another player.
4395000	4396000	Is Woolie Roberts here?
4397000	4399000	Woolie Roberts coming to the stage, would you join us?
4401000	4403000	Alright, so we're saying goodbye to Sarah.
4403000	4404000	Thanks, Sarah, everybody.
4404000	4405000	Thank you, Sarah.
4406000	4407000	Thank you, Sarah.
4410000	4413000	But Sarah, if I want another drink, you'll still be in the room, right?
4414000	4415000	No, she's done.
4416000	4417000	Sarah's over.
4418000	4419000	Wow.
4419000	4420000	My reign has begun.
4421000	4422000	I love it.
4422000	4425000	I think earlier we were trying to talk about skyscraper skip, right?
4426000	4427000	Scary.
4428000	4429000	Yay.
4429000	4430000	Woolie Roberts, everybody.
4430000	4432000	From the Real Life Sci-Fi, what's it called?
4432000	4435000	The Real Life Sci-Fi podcast, which is quite fucking good fun.
4435000	4436000	So dig that.
4437000	4438000	Also,
4439000	4443000	Woolie is the clan leader of my Clash of Clans clan, and he is...
4444000	4446000	I've got to come up with a better title for that position.
4449000	4450000	What about Grand Dragon?
4456000	4458000	Dungeons and Grand Dragons.
4459000	4461000	Alright, so Spencer, or Rob...
4461000	4466000	Rob, as Spencer's assistant, it's your job to dispense the character sheets for us.
4466000	4467000	Yes.
4469000	4471000	I heard someone gasp at that.
4471000	4477000	Aaron, you weren't here last week, but Demorge played Dignity Sarsgaard to great effect as Obama.
4479000	4482000	And I'm assuming that Woolie will be...
4483000	4484000	Christa Berg.
4485000	4487000	There's no way he's doing that right.
4487000	4488000	There's no way.
4490000	4491000	I got Sharpie.
4493000	4494000	I don't know whose that is.
4494000	4496000	So Rob, look at the names on the top of them.
4498000	4499000	That one's Dan, yep.
4500000	4502000	Avengers, this is for Dan.
4502000	4503000	Head on to Dan.
4503000	4504000	This is a nightmare.
4504000	4505000	Rob, you're doing it wrong.
4505000	4506000	You're doing it wrong.
4506000	4509000	This is Edit Point for Dustin.
4510000	4511000	Spencer, do...
4512000	4513000	Hey.
4513000	4515000	Turtle, George Washington.
4517000	4518000	Let's see.
4518000	4520000	What did George Washington do?
4520000	4523000	He sailed across the Seven Seas.
4523000	4524000	Yes.
4524000	4526000	That was exactly what he did.
4526000	4527000	Let's...
4527000	4531000	For you in the booth, I'm swapping mics so that my mic reaches shrub.
4532000	4533000	There we go.
4533000	4535000	On Christmas Day.
4535000	4537000	Alright, so Edit Point back in.
4537000	4538000	That happened, right?
4538000	4540000	Didn't they murder a bunch of British people on Christmas?
4540000	4541000	No.
4541000	4542000	Either way.
4544000	4545000	Either way...
4546000	4548000	Grey7Truth.org.
4548000	4550000	Grey7Truth.org.
4551000	4554000	Also, while this is being all ridiculous,
4554000	4558000	I'm gonna be up in Pittsburgh, I think, September 19th or something that weekend.
4558000	4559000	Wait, what the...
4559000	4560000	You have dates now?
4560000	4561000	I have a date.
4561000	4563000	This is the first date I'll ever have.
4563000	4564000	Last one, too.
4564000	4566000	I'll be at this thing.
4566000	4567000	It's called Knights of the Arcade.
4567000	4571000	It's basically an elongated version of the D&D pot thing that we do here.
4571000	4574000	But they wanted me to come guess it up.
4576000	4577000	Elongated?
4577000	4580000	Yeah, it's like the whole session is like a D&D.
4581000	4583000	So it's 10 hours?
4583000	4584000	It's like 10 hours.
4584000	4586000	It's a real marathon.
4586000	4590000	But, you know, we provide free water, and it's a great time.
4590000	4593000	If any of you guys who live in L.A. are out in Philadelphia or...
4593000	4595000	What did I say, Pittsburgh?
4595000	4596000	Pittsburgh.
4596000	4597000	I don't know where places are.
4597000	4598000	Home of the Sandwich.
4598000	4600000	Home of the Sandwich.
4600000	4603000	It's by the Monongahela and the whatever-the-fuck-rivers.
4603000	4605000	Home of the Sandwich.
4605000	4607000	All right, so Spencer...
4607000	4609000	Willie, you're gonna be Christoper.
4609000	4612000	He's a rogue and a thief.
4612000	4614000	He wrote one hit.
4614000	4616000	He wrote Lady in Red.
4616000	4622000	Aaron has become Dignity Sarsgaard, who last time was Obama, our president.
4622000	4624000	Spencer, do you want to take us away?
4624000	4627000	I feel like maybe Rob should take it away.
4627000	4628000	Yeah.
4629000	4632000	Read that first top paragraph.
4633000	4636000	Jeez, I don't have my glasses.
4642000	4644000	Oh, man, get ready.
4645000	4647000	We are ready.
4651000	4656000	When last we met, our heroes were just outside the juicery,
4656000	4657000	where...
4657000	4659000	I can't pronounce that word. What is that?
4659000	4660000	Darmvon.
4660000	4661000	Darmvon.
4661000	4664000	The drunken knight accused the local priest of misdeeds
4664000	4666000	and fell upon his own blade.
4666000	4669000	Father Tinder reacted by calling off.
4669000	4672000	The Jewish tour wanted to inform the wife and the kids,
4672000	4675000	but Sharpie insisted that they do it,
4675000	4679000	sparing him the trouble and headed to Mrs...
4679000	4680000	Darmvon.
4680000	4682000	Darn... Darmvon.
4682000	4684000	Shit, I scrolled down.
4687000	4690000	It would take over, tag out.
4690000	4694000	Mrs. Darmvon's home, where they broke the news and looked for clues,
4694000	4696000	convinced that the father was up to no good.
4696000	4700000	Meanwhile, Dignity and Krista Berg went back to the Constabulary
4700000	4703000	and met with Spizbol, the gnome they had saved.
4703000	4706000	They were immediately suspicious of Spizbol when thought sought to flee,
4706000	4710000	but the party reunited after Mrs. Darmvon spurned Sharpie's advances.
4710000	4715000	With Sharpie and Quark, the gang retired and conspired.
4715000	4718000	And drew up a plan to break into Father Tinder's house,
4718000	4721000	hoping to find incriminating evidence.
4721000	4723000	But what would our heroes uncover?
4723000	4725000	What evils may they face?
4725000	4727000	What laws would they be breaking?
4727000	4729000	Find out now, time.
4729000	4731000	Teamwork!
4734000	4737000	You know, you never realize that you think you're, you know,
4737000	4740000	that you might be good at something until you see someone else.
4740000	4742000	What, what, what the...
4742000	4744000	I didn't bring my glasses.
4744000	4746000	You sure did. You sure did.
4746000	4748000	I can't read with the shape that small.
4748000	4749000	You sure can't.
4749000	4750000	It's not fair.
4750000	4751000	It's not fair.
4751000	4752000	No, it's not.
4752000	4754000	You don't do notes in the middle of a show.
4754000	4755000	Oh, I do.
4755000	4757000	It's not fair. It's not cool.
4757000	4760000	The volunteers themselves are Assistant Dungeon Master.
4760000	4762000	Assistant, not Dungeon Master?
4762000	4765000	Bring my glasses.
4765000	4768000	I didn't know I was coming up. You didn't tell me.
4768000	4772000	Yeah, I didn't tell him. I snuck him in. I just, you know.
4772000	4777000	All right, so Spencer, it's me and Christa Berg
4777000	4779000	or Dignity breaking into the house right now.
4779000	4780000	What's happening?
4780000	4783000	You guys, you guys are all, yeah, okay.
4783000	4786000	So it's just nighttime. You guys just left Spizbulb's house.
4786000	4789000	He gave you a black bundle of cloth,
4789000	4792000	and you guys were going to sneak into Tinder's house.
4792000	4795000	And the bundle of cloth, he didn't specify what it was.
4795000	4797000	He said use this in case of emergency,
4797000	4800000	but also if you use it by the border, by the barrier,
4800000	4801000	that bad things would happen.
4801000	4802000	We leave town with it, I think.
4802000	4805000	It'll break, yeah, if the barrier's turned on.
4805000	4807000	But it'll be good in case of emergency
4807000	4809000	within the boundaries of that thing.
4809000	4810000	That's what he said.
4810000	4812000	He didn't really say that much about it, to be honest.
4812000	4813000	But that was the implication, right?
4813000	4814000	Yep.
4814000	4815000	That was the inference. Okay, so.
4815000	4816000	Definitely.
4816000	4817000	So where are we standing right now?
4817000	4820000	You guys are right outside of Spizbulb's tower,
4820000	4822000	just kind of in Rosebook in general.
4822000	4826000	It's really late at night, like maybe one o'clock, you know.
4826000	4830000	Well, you and Christa Berg are the stealthy ones,
4830000	4833000	I mean, I can come with, but I should keep a perimeter.
4833000	4836000	But we're about to break into Father Tender's crib right now, right?
4836000	4839000	Yeah. Okay, so it's me and...
4839000	4840000	And to Berg.
4840000	4841000	And Christa Berg.
4841000	4843000	We're going to go in and break into this guy's house.
4843000	4846000	We think he has a power shard.
4846000	4849000	And we're going to go break into this guy's house.
4849000	4851000	I have a teleport cape.
4851000	4853000	I can't do Kameil, sorry.
4853000	4855000	Can I bring somebody with me?
4855000	4859000	I want you to commit to doing a bad Kameil action.
4859000	4862000	Commit to being a bad Pakistani.
4862000	4864000	Who has a teleport cape?
4864000	4866000	According to my gear...
4866000	4870000	I feel like you must have Dan's item sheet.
4870000	4871000	How did that happen?
4871000	4874000	I don't know.
4874000	4876000	What kind of circus are you running here?
4876000	4877000	Oh, goodness.
4877000	4880000	Sorry, Christa Berg definitely doesn't have one of those.
4880000	4881000	Yep.
4881000	4884000	All right, so Chris, here's the deal.
4884000	4889000	I examine the house to look for entrances and exits and stuff.
4889000	4891000	You see the juicery.
4891000	4895000	It's a low ceiling rectangular building attached to a larger cylindrical building.
4895000	4897000	You know, that's like a normal house.
4897000	4900000	So it's like the juicery is attached to the house.
4900000	4901000	You see the juicery.
4901000	4907000	It's got these fine stained glass windows depicting roses and fruits and decanters and mugs in great detail.
4907000	4911000	The rest of the building is dressed in roses as is tradition around Rose Book.
4911000	4914000	So one of the buildings is where the juice is made.
4914000	4915000	The other one is where...
4915000	4916000	The fudge is made.
4916000	4917000	Yeah.
4917000	4919000	That's around the corner.
4919000	4921000	One's for milk and one's for lemonade.
4921000	4923000	If you go around the corner, I think...
4923000	4924000	Fudge is made.
4924000	4930000	If I put on my goggles of night, do I see anything else?
4930000	4933000	You can see all sorts of stuff.
4933000	4936000	Whoa.
4936000	4938000	That was Rob's tribe helping.
4938000	4945000	So yeah, you put on your goggles of night and you can see clearly in the darkness.
4945000	4952000	You can see into the juicery where metal and wooden devices lie dormant inside the juicery.
4952000	4955000	I go towards the dwelling where Father Tender lives.
4955000	4956000	All right, you do that.
4956000	4957000	You see...
4957000	4958000	Well, I mean, they're attached.
4958000	4959000	It's like the same building.
4959000	4961000	It's like there's two parts of it.
4961000	4964000	Christopher, you probably have a...
4964000	4965000	I can turn invisible.
4965000	4966000	You can turn invisible?
4966000	4967000	Yeah.
4967000	4968000	Well, do that.
4968000	4972000	But also, you have probably a thieves kit where you can break into, silently break into
4972000	4974000	like a lock and open a door, right?
4974000	4975000	Hey.
4975000	4976000	Yeah.
4976000	4977000	Guys, remember...
4977000	4978000	Sharpie, Sharpie, what are you doing here?
4978000	4980000	I can't go any further than this.
4980000	4982000	You're going to wait by the van.
4982000	4984000	I can't go any further.
4984000	4986000	He had it in his breast pocket.
4986000	4989000	Like he patted his breast when he was talking about...
4989000	4990000	Yeah.
4990000	4991000	Okay.
4991000	4992000	I'm slinking back.
4992000	4993000	Okay.
4993000	4994000	We go up to the door.
4994000	4995000	Chris, pick that lock.
4995000	4996000	Let's go.
4996000	4997000	All right.
4997000	5004720	I'm going to turn invisible, pick the lock, and then look for the breast pocket.
5004720	5005720	So a prom night.
5005720	5007560	That's what they call it.
5007560	5009560	That's the thief talk.
5009560	5014600	That's him turning invisible.
5014600	5016200	What's him picking the lock?
5016200	5017400	What?
5017400	5027440	What's him picking the lock sound like?
5027440	5029400	And just like that, the lock is open.
5029400	5032640	Roger Habner is in the house.
5032640	5037160	The lock was a cat's mouth.
5037160	5046400	Rob, can you open the door, but also do a chainsaw and a lawnmower at the same time?
5047400	5050400	Pretty amazing.
5050400	5054400	That's a joke for three people.
5054400	5057400	I don't get it.
5057400	5060400	There was a sound effects guy at Comedy Sports in Milwaukee.
5060400	5062400	He has passed now.
5062400	5063400	He was a craftsman.
5063400	5064400	Hilarious.
5064400	5068400	He would do sound effects, and then the referee for Comedy Sports would say,
5068400	5072400	Roger could do three sound effects at the same time, but the three sound effects were always...
5072400	5073400	Give me the three sound effects.
5073400	5075400	This is what it sounded like every night.
5075400	5078400	Give me three sound effects.
5078400	5091400	Roger, I'm going to start a vacuum cleaner,
5091400	5095400	and then I'm going to start an electric can opener, and then a chainsaw.
5095400	5096400	All right.
5096400	5099400	I think you're going to have to act it out for me to do mine.
5099400	5101400	So here we go, starting with the vacuum cleaner.
5105400	5109400	Electric can opener.
5109400	5118400	Chainsaw.
5118400	5119400	Amazing.
5119400	5121400	People would go crazy.
5121400	5128400	If you've never heard a man hum, then hum louder, then fart.
5135400	5138400	Well, it's nice that he has a legacy.
5138400	5141400	R.A.P. wherever you are.
5141400	5143400	Rest in peace, Roger.
5143400	5148400	He died in the sound booth.
5148400	5149400	Oh my God, really?
5149400	5150400	Did he really?
5150400	5153400	He died on the job?
5153400	5155400	Did they record him?
5155400	5156400	No.
5156400	5159400	And I'm not making a joke about this.
5159400	5160400	This is not funny at all.
5160400	5162400	Stop down and be emotional about this.
5162400	5164400	They buried him with his microphone.
5164400	5170400	Oh, that's great.
5170400	5173400	I got to meet him, and I heard him do the thing in the sound effects,
5173400	5175400	and I was like, that's fucking great.
5175400	5176400	And they called him Mr. Voice, right?
5176400	5178400	Mr. Voice?
5178400	5180400	I think that's the only thing he didn't have.
5180400	5182400	Mr. Sound effects probably.
5182400	5183400	Mr. Mouth?
5183400	5185400	We called our guy Comedy Sports LA.
5185400	5187400	Mouth and a microphone alone.
5187400	5192400	But he was like, he would make a lot of his sound effects sounded wet.
5192400	5193400	Yeah.
5193400	5194400	I'm going to make a peanut butter sandwich.
5194400	5199400	They sounded very fart-like.
5199400	5200400	Yes.
5200400	5202400	Ask the peanut butter sandwich.
5202400	5203400	All right.
5203400	5204400	So Spencer.
5204400	5208400	Do you want to unlock the door again?
5208400	5209400	Yes.
5209400	5211400	I...
5211400	5215400	Christoper, we've already opened the door, right?
5215400	5216400	Yeah, yeah.
5216400	5217400	I don't know.
5217400	5224400	Okay, so I creep in and examine the surroundings inside the doorway.
5224400	5226400	Yeah, yeah, you do that.
5226400	5229400	And inside you see several strange contraptions,
5229400	5232400	wooden racks with handles and gears and great wheels.
5232400	5235400	The walls of the juicery are lined with barrels,
5235400	5237400	each with roses affixed to the lids and sides.
5237400	5243400	You see drums of apples, oranges, grapes, raspberries, bananas, pineapples,
5243400	5246400	and even the most sinister fruit of all, the pear.
5247400	5249400	There's a small wooden hatch in the floor
5249400	5253400	and a small wooden bard gate joining the juicery in the house part of the building.
5253400	5257400	I go to the hatch and tell Chris to try to quietly open it.
5257400	5258400	Which one?
5258400	5259400	The hatch.
5259400	5260400	In the floor?
5260400	5261400	Yes.
5261400	5262400	All right.
5262400	5263400	Yeah, okay.
5263400	5266400	I'm going to quietly open it and then drop my robot baby in there.
5266400	5267400	Okay.
5267400	5271400	I'm not discouraging that at all, but I mean,
5271400	5274400	it's made of metal and dropping that would make noise.
5274400	5275400	I mean, do it anyway.
5275400	5280400	We're trying to break in at night to rob a shard off a guy's sleeping breast pocket.
5280400	5282400	But what would it sound like?
5287400	5288400	You don't know.
5288400	5290400	It might not be that loud.
5290400	5292400	We can't afford to make noises right now, Chris.
5292400	5293400	It might not be that loud.
5293400	5295400	We open the hatch.
5295400	5300400	This is the hatch that adjoins the juicery to the house.
5300400	5303400	Well, if it's the hatch in the floor, it doesn't.
5304400	5306400	There's a door and a hatch.
5306400	5307400	We go to the door.
5307400	5308400	I want the shard.
5308400	5309400	I don't care about the juicery.
5309400	5310400	All right.
5310400	5311400	You open...
5311400	5312400	Wait, wait.
5312400	5313400	You go to the door?
5313400	5314400	Yes.
5314400	5315400	You go to the door.
5315400	5316400	It's locked.
5317400	5320400	Chris, use your thieves' kit.
5320400	5325400	I'd like to use my thieves' kit and unlock the door while admiring my dragon dick.
5325400	5326400	Yeah.
5326400	5327400	Well, it's not on you.
5327400	5330400	It's just I think it's in your bag or whatever.
5330400	5331400	I'll still look at it.
5331400	5332400	Yeah.
5332400	5334400	It gives you focus.
5334400	5336400	It's like an energy drink.
5336400	5338400	But, yeah.
5338400	5339400	Well, that's not...
5339400	5341400	I mean, that's a weird reaction.
5341400	5342400	Anyway, you do it.
5342400	5343400	It opens.
5348400	5349400	Chris.
5349400	5350400	Chris.
5350400	5354400	You've got your goggles on, your low light vision stuff.
5354400	5355400	Yeah.
5355400	5356400	Lead the way.
5356400	5357400	Tell me what you see.
5357400	5359400	I lead the way.
5359400	5361400	And tell Jeff what I see.
5361400	5362400	Oh.
5362400	5363400	Quirk.
5363400	5364400	That's right.
5365400	5366400	What is that noise?
5366400	5367400	That's his vision.
5367400	5368400	That's his little light goggles.
5368400	5370400	Those sound different.
5371400	5374400	This room is a combination sitting and dining room.
5374400	5377400	A wooden table with chairs dominates half.
5377400	5381400	And a small fireplace with nicer cushion chairs dominates the other half.
5381400	5387400	You see a small door and also a small enclosed stairwell leading to the second floor.
5388400	5392400	The cushions from the chairs, we're going to attach those to our shoes.
5392400	5393400	All right.
5393400	5394400	Okay.
5398400	5399400	Rob.
5399400	5400400	What does that sound like?
5400400	5402400	We fashion cushion shoes.
5403400	5404400	Oh.
5409400	5411400	Optimus Prime just came in.
5414400	5415400	All right.
5415400	5420400	You guys are playing a CD-ROM video game for kids from the 90s.
5420400	5421400	All right.
5421400	5425400	I feel like he was probably sleeping upstairs because the bedroom in the house like this
5425400	5427400	would probably be upstairs.
5428400	5432400	I use my ears.
5432400	5437400	My Noma here is to detect where the snoring is coming from, Spencer.
5437400	5439400	It's coming from upstairs.
5439400	5440400	All right.
5441400	5448400	I creep up first and I draw, what's my smallest weapon?
5448400	5450400	I draw like a dagger or a small sword.
5450400	5451400	Yeah.
5451400	5453400	I draw a dagger and walk up the stairs.
5454400	5455400	Okay.
5455400	5460400	So before you can get up those stairs, you hear a noise.
5460400	5463400	The stomping of feet and the breaking of glass.
5463400	5464400	Actually.
5466400	5467400	Smash.
5470400	5471400	Reverse order.
5471400	5475400	You hear smashing of glass and then the breaking of the feeding.
5479400	5481400	That sounded much better.
5481400	5482400	I'm sorry, folks.
5482400	5488400	Then from upstairs you hear a no, no, no, no.
5496400	5497400	He's good.
5499400	5502400	I charge up the stairs and kick in the door.
5502400	5505400	Upstairs you find Father Tinder.
5505400	5506400	Tinder.
5506400	5510400	Sprawled out on the floor covered in blood that streams from his mouth and face.
5511400	5512400	He groans weakly.
5514400	5518400	Are you saying that we fucking missed this because we tied cushions to our feet.
5518400	5519400	He groans weakly.
5523400	5524400	As if in pain.
5527400	5529400	Do we see the attacker?
5529400	5530400	Wait.
5530400	5531400	Do you?
5532400	5533400	Yep.
5533400	5539400	A shadowy figure wielding a thin fencing foil is escaping through the broken window and
5539400	5540400	up to the juicery roof.
5540400	5545400	I lunge toward him with my dagger in hand as fast as I can to try to apprehend him and
5545400	5546400	stab him.
5546400	5547400	All right.
5547400	5548400	Yeah.
5548400	5549400	What did you draw?
5549400	5550400	Dagger.
5550400	5551400	Okay.
5551400	5552400	What's the damage on that?
5552400	5553400	Do I have a dagger?
5553400	5554400	I don't even know.
5554400	5556400	It's 1d4 if it's non-magical.
5556400	5559400	Well, actually it's 1d3 since you're small.
5559400	5560400	Yeah.
5560400	5563400	I don't have a dagger in my inventory, but I'm assuming I've stolen so many knives.
5563400	5564400	All right.
5564400	5569400	Leaping after the foe, you catch yourself on a piece of broken shattered glass that's
5569400	5573400	on the floor and you slip and fall and you stab yourself in the stomach.
5573400	5574400	What?
5574400	5578400	Three damage to yourself and you fall flat on your face.
5578400	5579400	Did you roll a one?
5579400	5580400	Yeah, I sure did.
5580400	5581400	You piece of shit.
5581400	5582400	I need new dice.
5582400	5583400	Yeah.
5583400	5585400	Straight up need new dice.
5585400	5587400	I'd like to do, can I do multiple things?
5587400	5588400	Can I?
5588400	5589400	Maybe.
5589400	5591400	I saw something about blinding.
5592400	5594400	You have a blinding bomb, I think.
5594400	5599400	I'll throw a blinding bomb at him, use my sneak attack and then become invisible.
5599400	5600400	All right.
5600400	5601400	Well, you can't sneak attack it.
5601400	5608400	Then I go by Roth IRA and I provide for my family and I live a full life.
5608400	5610400	I wait until I can sell high.
5610400	5612400	And I have a beautiful funeral.
5612400	5618400	Well, you can't sneak attack him because he's not like, he's aware of you somehow.
5619400	5622400	You're already invisible already because you made yourself invisible before.
5622400	5623400	It's true.
5623400	5629400	Can I use the, can I intensify wins and push him, try to push him back into the window
5629400	5630400	he's sneaking out of?
5630400	5634400	You can, you can do that, but yeah.
5634400	5635400	What does it sound like?
5635400	5637400	It would sound pretty interesting, I'm sure.
5648400	5651400	The wins are about that fierce, it doesn't really affect him at all.
5654400	5663400	I have to ask at this point, if I'm outside, I'm positioned at being the microchip to this Punisher Comics adventure.
5663400	5664400	Yeah.
5664400	5666400	Like, am I seeing somebody coming out a window?
5666400	5671400	Curiously, you didn't see, you didn't see anyone sneak onto the property or whatever, but wait.
5671400	5673400	No, I didn't see anything.
5674400	5678400	I don't think my thoughts are audible.
5678400	5680400	Shucks, I got it.
5680400	5682400	Nobody there.
5682400	5687400	You don't see anything, but you do hear the shattering of glass as if a window's being broken.
5687400	5689400	It's on the far side of the building.
5689400	5691400	Sounds like something's breaking over there.
5691400	5692400	Wait, wait, wait.
5692400	5694400	At that point, I remember our signal.
5694400	5695400	What was our signal?
5695400	5697400	I would do what?
5697400	5698400	Silver dollars.
5698400	5699400	Silver dollars.
5699400	5700400	Silver dollars.
5700400	5701400	But I say it twice, right?
5702400	5704400	You can say it a bunch, but in a panic.
5704400	5705400	I forget the code.
5705400	5706400	Silver dollars.
5706400	5707400	Silver dollars.
5707400	5708400	Silver dollar.
5708400	5709400	Avenger.
5709400	5710400	Silver dollar.
5710400	5714400	That means Avenger's going to go fly around to the place of the sound.
5714400	5717400	I want Avenger to do a little drone surveillance.
5721400	5723400	Avenger's a helicopter.
5728400	5729400	Yeah.
5730400	5731400	Avenger comes back.
5731400	5734400	He's like, I saw a small thing running off.
5734400	5735400	Fucking follow him.
5735400	5736400	You don't come back to me.
5736400	5737400	I'm following you.
5737400	5738400	Oh.
5738400	5739400	Sorry about that.
5746400	5750400	Spencer, from where I'm standing, am I able to see the guy?
5750400	5753400	No, it's on the other side of the building where you guys are standing.
5753400	5759400	Do I notice anything strange with somebody who's spent a lot of time in good old Rosebook?
5759400	5763400	Not other than hearing the shattering of glass on the other side of the building.
5763400	5764400	Smash.
5764400	5765400	All right.
5765400	5771400	Well, I stand and I stew because this is a conundrum.
5771400	5774400	I want to protect these people, but they're also stealing.
5774400	5776400	So I feel very guilty.
5776400	5777400	Guilt.
5777400	5778400	Guilt.
5783400	5786400	And I take a gold piece out of my pocket.
5786400	5791400	I put it in my mouth and spit it up into the air and hit it on my heel and then throw it on the ground.
5791400	5792400	Tink.
5792400	5793400	Oh, right.
5793400	5794400	I'm running.
5794400	5795400	I'm running toward Avenger.
5795400	5800400	I'm using Avenger to, like, we had an agreement with Avenger.
5800400	5803400	My character isn't my weight.
5804400	5809400	You don't have to make it sound like a kid from a hot dog commercial.
5809400	5813400	Because that's how they sell hot dogs.
5813400	5817400	I didn't lose my ice cream down a storm drain.
5817400	5821400	You can stow the tubas.
5824400	5827400	Thank you.
5827400	5831400	My character's built like Steven Merchant, just for the record.
5832400	5834400	I had a deal with Avenger.
5834400	5837400	Avenger's following the thing faster than I can.
5837400	5839400	I'm following Avenger.
5839400	5840400	You had a deal.
5840400	5841400	Okay.
5841400	5842400	So you give chase.
5842400	5848400	You give chase until you see what looks like a massive ice crystal in the middle of the street.
5848400	5855400	You find six armed guards standing frozen in a combination of terror and magic.
5855400	5865400	Shimmering force energy kind of traps them in place and they can't move at all encased in this glowing glass-like substance.
5865400	5866400	Six armed.
5866400	5870400	I mean, this is about what I predicted, if I'm honest.
5870400	5873400	I note that distraction, but I continue on.
5873400	5875400	I'm chasing the...
5875400	5880400	You continue on towards Mrs. Darmvon's house.
5880400	5882400	Welcome.
5882400	5885400	Let's cut to the inside of the house.
5885400	5886400	What's happening there?
5886400	5893400	So the guy, the attacker that killed or at least tried to assail Father Tinder has left the building, right?
5893400	5894400	Oh, he's gone.
5894400	5897400	And is that who Sharpie is chasing right now?
5897400	5898400	Yes.
5898400	5905400	I go and I get up off my ass and I examine Father Tinder to see if the shard is still in his breast pocket.
5905400	5907400	You don't find any breast pockets.
5907400	5908400	Is he alive?
5908400	5910400	Yeah, he's grown in weekly.
5910400	5911400	I say, Father Tinder, what happened?
5912400	5914400	I was attacked by...
5914400	5916400	It was that goddamn gnome.
5916400	5917400	Fizzbob?
5917400	5920400	I don't know his name. Fizzbam?
5920400	5921400	Stephen?
5921400	5922400	It's Fizzbob.
5923400	5924400	He attacked you?
5924400	5925400	Oh, man, yeah.
5925400	5926400	Are you okay?
5926400	5928400	Fucking gnomes, man. Get away from me.
5928400	5930400	I'm a gnome, but I'm on your side, man.
5930400	5932400	Don't murder me.
5932400	5934400	You come to finish the job.
5935400	5936400	I fuck him.
5938400	5939400	For real, though?
5940400	5941400	Yeah, I fuck him.
5942400	5947400	I grab him and I say, Father Tinder, in your weakened state...
5948400	5951400	In your weakened state, I'm going to tell you this.
5951400	5953400	I never liked you.
5953400	5955400	I fucking never liked you to begin with.
5955400	5958400	You've been dishonest with us from the fucking outset.
5958400	5964400	So I hold him kind of tenderly, like Patrick Swayze-style, by the head.
5964400	5967400	And I just missionary fuck him.
5968400	5972400	And I intensify the winds while this is going on.
5975400	5981400	I hear what's going on down on the ground and I run into the tower to stop it.
5981400	5985400	You burst in and see a grisly scene unfolding before you.
5986400	5989400	Gnome! Gnome, you needn't do this.
5989400	5991400	Look at me. Gnome, look at me.
5991400	5993400	Oh, I'm looking at you.
5993400	5996400	No, don't look at me. Don't look at me.
5997400	5999400	All right? Look at the ground.
5999400	6002400	I'm looking at you while fucking Father Tinder right now.
6002400	6004400	All right, fine. I'm going to look...
6004400	6006400	Father Tinder, don't fight me.
6007400	6008400	Help me.
6008400	6009400	Gnome.
6009400	6010400	Help me.
6010400	6014400	Gnome, I want you to reach into the bottom part of your soul and I want you to just...
6014400	6015400	I already am.
6015400	6016400	Please don't.
6017400	6022400	I want you to stir up the seeds of goodness.
6022400	6023400	I want you to...
6023400	6024400	I already am.
6025400	6028400	He's about to be filled with my seeds of goodness.
6028400	6030400	Stop talking. Stop it.
6030400	6033400	All right, I just... Please, please don't do this.
6033400	6034400	You're going to...
6034400	6035400	It's too late. It's already happening.
6035400	6043400	Okay, and then I'm going to intervene and pull Quark off of poor Mr. Tinder.
6043400	6045400	Father, all right.
6045400	6054400	He comes right out with a pop.
6054400	6057400	You've rested him out.
6057400	6064400	Father Tinder, I know that nothing that I can say can repair the damage that has been done, but...
6064400	6069400	At night, I want you to look for your seeds of healing.
6069400	6072400	I start fucking him again.
6072400	6075400	I kick him you off again.
6075400	6078400	I lie on top of Father Tinder like a...
6078400	6079400	I start fucking you, then.
6079400	6080400	No, you don't.
6080400	6081400	I start fucking both of you.
6081400	6084400	You're dominated physically by dignity.
6084400	6088400	Yeah, and so I flip you over and I make my...
6088400	6089400	I turn you on your stomach.
6089400	6091400	I'm trying to fuck everybody right now.
6091400	6094400	I'm fucking anything that moves.
6094400	6098400	I'm on top of you just shushing in your ear and I use...
6098400	6099400	I'm trying to fucking...
6099400	6100400	God damn it.
6100400	6101400	I use...
6101400	6102400	Where is it?
6102400	6103400	Diplomacy.
6103400	6104400	I use diplomacy.
6104400	6105400	I use diplomacy.
6105400	6106400	I go into barbarian fuckrage.
6106400	6107400	You don't.
6107400	6108400	You don't.
6108400	6109400	Barbarian fuckrage.
6109400	6110400	No, I said fine.
6110400	6111400	Barbarian fuckrage.
6111400	6134160	Okay.
6134160	6139520	You do that going into a barbarian rage but maybe it's the stab wound you've just inflicted
6140520	6142520	but you still are too weak and small.
6142520	6143520	Wait.
6143520	6144520	I use...
6144520	6146520	I rolled a two that time.
6146520	6154520	I use diplomacy and I get my face right in your tiny little baby ear.
6154520	6161520	And I say, look, if you mess with me again, I'm going to take your dreams.
6161520	6165520	I'm going to eat your dreams.
6165520	6168520	I'm going to feed them.
6168520	6171520	I cast two gives a shit.
6171520	6172520	All right.
6172520	6173520	Thanks, Jeff.
6173520	6174520	I'm going to...
6174520	6182520	So I use diplomacy to convince him that I'm not to be trifled with.
6182520	6187520	Well, being in a barbarian rage, he can't hear reason, I'm afraid.
6187520	6188520	Okay.
6188520	6189520	So I'm going to...
6189520	6190520	I'm just going to tie...
6190520	6191520	I'm going to...
6191520	6193520	Is there a closet in the room or anything?
6193520	6194520	Yeah.
6194520	6195520	Okay.
6195520	6196520	I'm going to throw him in the closet.
6196520	6197520	I'm just watching.
6197520	6198520	I'm here.
6198520	6199520	I'm in the closet.
6199520	6200520	No, no, no.
6200520	6201520	Not Father Tinder.
6201520	6202520	I'm going to...
6202520	6203520	Oh, I see him.
6203520	6204520	Okay.
6204520	6205520	I'm going to...
6205520	6206520	Look at me.
6206520	6207520	I'm in the closet.
6207520	6209520	I'm going to throw a quirk into the closet and then I'm going...
6209520	6210520	Put him in here with me.
6210520	6215520	I see you have something called magic bracers.
6215520	6217520	Could I use that to keep the door closed?
6217520	6218520	They're just armor.
6218520	6219520	Okay.
6219520	6220520	They're like magical armor.
6220520	6222520	I push the door up against the...
6222520	6223520	I say to her...
6223520	6224520	The bed up against the door.
6224520	6231520	I say to Digne Sarsgaard who we just met, look, we never liked this guy.
6231520	6234120	There's a power shard that's been stolen, I think, by somebody else.
6234120	6236520	We have bigger fish to fry.
6236520	6238520	There's no reason fighting in here.
6238520	6240520	We should go get the person we're getting.
6240520	6241520	Also, fuck Father Tinder.
6241520	6242520	He's an asshole.
6242520	6243520	He's never been good to anybody.
6243520	6247520	I think he's probably one of the bad people in town.
6247520	6250520	That's a rapist.
6250520	6253520	Whoever said that, I'm going to come over there and rape you right now.
6253520	6255520	Live action fucking girl playing.
6255520	6257520	I'm going to larp rape you right now.
6257520	6260520	Oh, boy.
6260520	6262520	Oh, yeah, rape you.
6262520	6263520	All right.
6263520	6265520	Meanwhile, outside...
6265520	6266520	Yes, okay.
6266520	6267520	All right.
6267520	6268520	I'm running and chasing the guy.
6268520	6269520	You're running and chasing.
6269520	6273520	That's how it sounds.
6273520	6275520	You're so thin.
6275520	6280520	You find yourself outside Darmvon household, the Darmvon household.
6280520	6285520	You see that one of the walls, the wall nearest you, has a massive hole in its side.
6285520	6291520	It's a strange pentagonal shape that must have been cut by one of the sharpest blades in history.
6291520	6293520	It's so clean, this cut.
6293520	6298520	Massive chunks of hewn stone lie in the grass on the ground.
6298520	6300520	I guess that's what grass is.
6300520	6302520	I wasn't already outside the Darmvon.
6302520	6304520	No, you were heading towards there.
6304520	6306520	That was your heading.
6306520	6307520	Okay.
6307520	6309520	Well, I just want to continue to chase the...
6309520	6312520	Well, it looks like that's where it's gone.
6312520	6313520	It's gone to the...
6313520	6314520	Oh, the Darmvon.
6314520	6315520	Yeah, I'm sorry.
6315520	6316520	I got confused there.
6316520	6317520	I apologize.
6317520	6318520	Okay.
6318520	6320520	I charge and walk through the pentagonal...
6320520	6322520	I get confused about Darmvon.
6322520	6323520	Yeah, okay.
6323520	6324520	Sorry about that.
6324520	6327520	I charge through that pentagonal egress.
6327520	6329520	How does that sound?
6329520	6331520	Not an eagle.
6331520	6332520	Well, that's wrong.
6332520	6333520	That's wrong.
6333520	6334520	I'm sorry.
6334520	6335520	I wasn't listening.
6335520	6336520	Inside...
6336520	6337520	What are we doing?
6337520	6338520	No, you're good.
6338520	6339520	Hang back.
6339520	6340520	Okay.
6340520	6341520	Okay.
6341520	6342520	Inside is a scene of...
6342520	6343520	Standing by.
6343520	6346520	Inside is a scene of devastation.
6346520	6349520	Everything is askew or exploded or cut in half.
6349520	6351520	Furniture, walls, doors.
6351520	6353520	Oh, my gosh.
6353520	6356520	These oddly clean cuts.
6356520	6357520	Yuck.
6357520	6358520	That's not...
6358520	6359520	Things don't make sounds.
6359520	6361520	There's things that don't make sounds.
6361520	6363520	Most things don't make sounds, I'd say.
6363520	6364520	But these do.
6364520	6365520	Ew.
6365520	6366520	I mean...
6369520	6370520	Smell.
6370520	6372520	I feel like my position on this was clear.
6372520	6374520	A lot of your favorite movies would be ruined by this.
6374520	6377520	Like, if every clue in Seven was like,
6377520	6379520	I'm a fat guy that's dead.
6379520	6381520	I'm a head in a box.
6381520	6382520	Yeah.
6382520	6383520	What's in the box?
6383520	6385520	I told you, I'm a head.
6387520	6389520	But those weren't podcasts.
6389520	6390520	They sure weren't.
6390520	6392520	John Doe has the upper hand.
6392520	6393520	I'm a super hand.
6393520	6394520	Oh!
6394520	6396520	I'm up here.
6397520	6398520	Notes after the show.
6398520	6399520	After the show.
6401520	6403520	So, yeah, all those things I just said.
6403520	6404520	Everything's just strewn and...
6404520	6406520	Cut in half and into pieces.
6406520	6411520	You see a splintered door appears to be one of the only things not hacked to pieces.
6411520	6414520	Instead, maybe just exploded or smashed somehow.
6414520	6415520	Mrs. Darfot!
6415520	6417520	You hear no response.
6417520	6420520	Mrs. Darfot, I go to the door and kick at it.
6420520	6423520	Inside, you see a grisly sight.
6424520	6426520	The corpse of Mrs. Darfot.
6426520	6427520	Jesus Christ.
6427520	6432520	Cased in a mound of silvery force energy.
6436520	6437520	Really?
6446520	6447520	There we go.
6447520	6449520	Spencer just took away Rob's mic.
6450520	6453520	Encased in a mound of silvery force energy.
6453520	6454520	Dripping with blood.
6454520	6455520	Her head clean.
6455520	6456520	Cut off at the neck.
6456520	6457520	What?
6457520	6459520	You see another small body lying on the floor.
6459520	6463520	A pillar of force extending out of the cracked ground where the head should be.
6463520	6469520	Blood spills across the floor and standing in the window sill is the small shadowy figure.
6469520	6471520	Here you can recognize him clearly.
6471520	6474520	It's Spizbulb, the gnome, all in black ninja gear.
6474520	6475520	Spizbulb!
6475520	6476520	Fuck!
6481520	6482520	You fuckers!
6482520	6484520	That's what you get!
6485520	6486520	Yeah?
6486520	6487520	Well, here's what you get.
6487520	6488520	Fireball!
6493520	6499520	Okay, so he stands stock still, completely laughing and not able to dodge.
6499520	6504520	But as your fireball impacts where his face should be, you see a dazzling flash of white
6504520	6508520	light and in an instant it's gone, disappeared, and he looks happy.
6509520	6516520	You see a crackle and a fizz as a sort of white shimmering barrier kind of shimmers out of existence in front of him.
6516520	6517520	Fuck.
6518520	6519520	You fuckers!
6520520	6523520	I use my teleport cape to teleport to behind him.
6523520	6524520	Alright, you do that.
6530520	6532520	And then I...
6532520	6533520	Just give me one second.
6533520	6534520	Wait, one second.
6534520	6536520	Fuck, I don't have any fucking...
6536520	6537520	Make it big, Dan, because we're close to the end.
6537520	6540520	I need like a diffuse magic kind of thing.
6540520	6542520	I don't have anything like that.
6542520	6545520	I'm behind him.
6545520	6547520	I'm successfully behind him.
6547520	6550520	I'm just gonna try to cause fear on him.
6550520	6553520	Alright, you do that.
6553520	6555520	And I go, hey!
6559520	6564520	He turns around, seemingly unaffected by your action.
6564520	6565520	Fuck.
6565520	6566520	He's not afraid.
6566520	6567520	Your dice are broken, man.
6567520	6568520	Yeah, no, they're fucked up.
6568520	6570520	I'll take some dice if anyone has them.
6570520	6581520	But he waves his hands in a magical manner and you see a sheet, a rectangular sheet of force energy start to coalesce into existence above his hand.
6583520	6584520	It gets bigger.
6584520	6585520	I run.
6586520	6587520	You run.
6587520	6588520	Yeah.
6588520	6590520	He launches it directly.
6590520	6591520	Someone actually has dice.
6591520	6595520	He launches it directly at you and you dodge out of the way.
6596520	6601520	It smashes and slices a clean cut through a wall and continues going on.
6601520	6602520	Chop!
6603520	6606520	Meanwhile, outside or wherever, what are you guys doing?
6606520	6610520	I've jumped out of the window, stopping, raping...
6610520	6611520	Wait, you're in the closet?
6611520	6612520	Did that actually happen?
6612520	6613520	No, I never got in the closet.
6613520	6615520	I threw you in the closet.
6615520	6617520	You were physically forced into it.
6617520	6624520	Yeah, I break out and follow the trail of action towards where the guy...
6624520	6625520	Does he break out?
6625520	6626520	Let's see.
6626520	6627520	I push the bed up against the closet door.
6627520	6630520	No, you break your wrist.
6631520	6633520	So it's not just my dice.
6633520	6634520	It's not just my dice.
6634520	6636520	That was a one, yeah.
6636520	6637520	I jump out of the...
6637520	6641520	So Diggity Sarsgaard has put me in the closet when I'm trying to help my friend Sharpie out?
6641520	6642520	Well, you were trying to rape someone.
6642520	6644520	Yes, that's why I put you in the closet.
6644520	6646520	Because you were being so helpful.
6646520	6649520	But yeah, battering down the door, you break your wrist.
6649520	6650520	You had nothing to do with it.
6650520	6651520	You were doing shit.
6651520	6652520	Well, she's a paladin.
6652520	6653520	They're like police.
6653520	6655520	Well, I mean, police wouldn't let that happen.
6655520	6656520	I don't like the police.
6656520	6657520	I don't like the police either.
6657520	6658520	Fuck the police.
6658520	6659520	Fuck the police.
6659520	6660520	But you know what?
6660520	6661520	TV dramas are about them.
6661520	6662520	Yeah.
6662520	6663520	I don't watch those shows.
6663520	6665520	Not about rapists.
6666520	6667520	I don't rape people.
6667520	6669520	I just fuck people.
6670520	6675520	I use my climbing kit and my fast stealth and try to follow the trail.
6675520	6676520	You do that.
6676520	6677520	You follow the trail.
6681520	6682520	I follow behind.
6682520	6683520	Am I agile enough to follow behind?
6683520	6684520	Oh, yeah, totally.
6684520	6689520	I'm in the closet making a private decree to kill Dignity Sarsgaard.
6689520	6691520	Under any circumstances.
6691520	6693520	I make her my own target.
6693520	6696520	Well, your promise is so powerful that the door opens.
6697520	6699520	That time I got a turn.
6700520	6702520	I don't know what's happening today with these days.
6702520	6704520	I also apologize before I left.
6704520	6705520	Is that cool?
6705520	6706520	Yeah, no, that happened.
6706520	6708520	To the guy that Jeff was fucking.
6708520	6711520	I yell out, we have to help Sharpie right now.
6711520	6712520	He's alone.
6712520	6713520	We have to.
6713520	6714520	We're ahead of you.
6714520	6715520	We're doing that.
6715520	6716520	Yeah, you're great.
6716520	6719520	I love this argument that I stopped you raping.
6719520	6721520	So I'm a bad person.
6722520	6723520	Yeah.
6723520	6726520	So you guys are all converging on the location.
6726520	6730520	But who knows what will happen in the future?
6730520	6734520	No, don't fucking fucking cliffhanger us.
6734520	6736520	No, we have to have an actual cliffhanger.
6736520	6737520	Well, it seems like a cliffhanger.
6737520	6740520	You're kind of racing towards this deadly murderer who's.
6740520	6741520	But Dan is there, right?
6741520	6742520	Sharpie is there.
6742520	6743520	And he's escaping.
6743520	6745520	He's running away in terror last I checked.
6745520	6746520	Oh, stop.
6746520	6747520	Seems like a real.
6747520	6748520	Leave me alone.
6748520	6749520	Oh, stop.
6749520	6750520	Stop it.
6750520	6751520	I'm running away.
6751520	6752520	Stop.
6752520	6753520	Stop.
6753520	6754520	Ow.
6754520	6755520	Stop.
6755520	6756520	Stop it.
6756520	6757520	Please.
6757520	6758520	Please.
6758520	6759520	Please.
