0	8640	Hey, Kevin, open up.
8640	11400	Who is it?
11400	13040	It's Tom.
13040	17960	Tom, Tom, you, I leave the key under the mat.
17960	18960	You know this.
18960	22800	I got a, I got a six legs full of pollen here.
22800	23800	I can't get the key.
23800	24800	What?
24800	29560	You're supposed to keep one pollen free leg so you can go under my mat and open the door.
29560	30760	Well, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
30760	31760	Then I wouldn't make your quota.
31760	38560	Shit, now I spilled half of the, fuck, God damn it, what are you even doing here?
38560	39560	It's springtime.
39560	43760	Hey, shut the door, lock the door.
43760	45400	I killed a guy.
45400	46400	What?
46400	47400	What?
47400	48400	Yeah.
48400	49400	Kevin.
49400	50400	I stung a guy.
50400	51400	I didn't know that he was allergic to bees.
51400	52400	I killed him.
52400	53400	Look.
53400	54400	To stung someone?
54400	57680	Truth be told, I heard that he might have been allergic to bees, but he's been mean
57680	61960	to bees for most of his life and I stung him on purpose.
61960	66000	I am going to die because now that my, yeah, I was going to say stinger ripped out of my
66000	67000	butthole.
67000	68400	I only have like about four minutes to live.
68400	70400	Jesus, Kevin, you buried the lead.
70400	71400	No, I killed him.
71400	72400	Kevin.
72400	73400	Oh God, Kevin.
73400	74400	Buzz, buzzes.
74400	75400	Buzzes.
75400	76400	No.
76400	77400	Buzzes.
77400	80960	Oh, why are we designed this way?
80960	85080	It doesn't make any evolutionary sense.
85080	86560	Your majesty.
86560	87880	Yeah.
87880	89880	Hey.
89880	93520	Kevin stung someone and he died.
93520	96320	That's what happens.
96320	97960	Yes it is.
97960	105320	It's hard to be a bee.
105320	107440	Your voice has gotten deeper.
107440	109600	No, it hasn't.
109600	117080	It's always been like this.
117080	121120	We should play bee ping pong.
121120	122120	Okay.
122120	123120	Tink.
123120	124120	Tink.

139640	141080	This is what ghost bees sound like.
141080	142360	Bees can have ghosts.
142360	143360	Yeah.
143360	147400	You guys should play a new game that bees play.
147400	148800	Okay.
148800	151200	It's called Bee and Bee.
151200	155440	Yeah, it's hard to improvise the end of a sketch, right?
155440	159560	Like, I mean, it's easy to improvise them, but then how do you end one?
159560	162040	Wait, say that again?
162040	164840	How do you end the, how do you end an improvised sketch?
164840	171840	Live from New York, it's Saturday night!
171840	177040	Lorraine Newman, musical artist.
177040	179040	I'm telling you, this format has promise.
179040	194120	Rachel Dratch, Kate McKinnon, Kevin Sudeikis, Steve Chiatakis, Tommy Hilzweger, Adi Cornish,
194120	202080	Ted Nugent, an institutionalized policy of not protecting our writers.
202080	209320	Time up, town Burbank, Harman Town is now in session.
209320	212320	Spencer Crittenden, I'm Jeff Davis, you're coming to all the welcome to the stage.
212320	213320	He's already there.
213320	214320	He was a bee in that sketch.
214320	219320	He was Tom the Bee, the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman, everybody.
219320	221240	Oh, yeah.
221240	224240	And then should I, in the format, should I do like this?
224240	228240	Yeah, in the format, you should do like that.
228240	229240	Okay, thank you.
229240	230240	No, no, no, no, no.
230240	234680	I think, let's take it, come off stage and then you walk down like you're, you're Steve
234680	235680	Martin.
235680	237160	Okay, so, we need like sexy music.
237160	241320	Next week when we do this, should we just, since we're working this out, should we try
241320	245720	to do another sketch and then, so that we can end it and I'll run off and then we'll
245720	246720	restart the show?
246720	249400	But you should also have like a different outfit on, like a suit jacket or something
249400	250400	like that.
250400	251400	Alright.
251400	253000	So, how are we doing?
253000	254000	Right now, what are we doing?
254000	255000	We're going to just try.
255000	256600	Let's just start the sketch over.
256600	260840	Yeah, let's just do another bee sketch and we'll try to make it faster because it's really
260840	264800	just, the results aren't important, we'll just, I don't know if we should say live from
264800	265800	New York on Saturday night.
265800	266800	It's not the name of the show.
266800	267800	Well, we got live from Burbank.
267800	269800	It's Harman Town night.
269800	272400	I think it was original and no one's done that joke.
272400	273800	Well, I'll leave it to you guys.
273800	276000	Well, let's, let's feel it up.
276000	277000	Okay.
277000	278000	Let's go, let's go.
278000	279000	Let's black it out.
279600	282000	I'll turn off my iPad so it's not being a thing.
282000	283000	Alright.
283000	284000	Okay.
284000	287000	For those of you who are listening, you know, it's no worse.
287000	301240	Yeah, let's, no, let's, let's keep them off so that the subscribers can, just, Chris,
301240	302240	do one thing.
302240	304080	Take it all, all lights totally down.
304080	307400	Can you just throw them up totally full lights really fast?
307400	308400	Oh God.
308800	309800	Okay.
309800	311800	So now, keep it down.
311800	312800	Okay.
312800	319800	Some bee in this room is a murderer.
319800	320800	Hmm.
320800	325800	Wouldn't it be the guy whose guts are hanging out of his abdomen?
325800	327800	No, that's the, that was the murdery.
327800	331800	But when we kill people, we, we die too.
331800	333800	Our stingers rip out.
334800	345800	Why are you the only bee in this room with a stinger clumsily taped to your butthole?
345800	349800	Who may be?
349800	352800	Harmentown is now in session.
352800	355800	Hey everybody, welcome to Uptown Burbank.
355800	357800	It's Harmentown.
357800	359800	Nice.
360800	364800	Sarah Huckabee Sanders is on the show tonight.
364800	368800	Musical guest, the Coldplay.
368800	379800	And the host, special guest, Dan Harmon.
379800	382800	Oh yeah.
382800	384800	Drop a rap beat.
384800	387800	Well, we had a good, listen, we've got a great show.
387800	388800	It's always great to be back.
388800	391800	This is my 307th time hosting Harmentown.
391800	394800	And, you know.
394800	396800	Hey, I'm Bobby Moynihan.
396800	398800	I'm Bobby Moynihan.
398800	400800	I'm being Bobby Moynihan over here.
400800	402800	Look at this guy.
402800	404800	I'm Bobby Moynihan.
404800	406800	See, I understand, I get that a lot.
406800	407800	Game of Thrones.
407800	411800	Because of the reason why I was asked to host a lot of times Bobby Moynihan or Kenan Thompson
411800	415800	will come out and stand next to me and then we'll go into a musical number.
415800	417800	I'm Kenan Thompson.
417800	420800	Stop.
420800	422800	But I mean.
422800	427800	Listen guys, for the last time, I'm not going to do a song.
427800	429800	A rap song.
434800	438800	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
438800	443800	I'm a special guy, going down the riverbed.
443800	450800	Got a special eye in my special head and what do I see on the shore.
450800	455800	A man making s'mores for me.
455800	457800	I'm Alec Baldwin.
457800	459800	Alec Baldwin.
459800	460800	Yeah.
460800	462800	You're not a hair loss.
462800	464800	You're a Baldwin.
464800	466800	Like that word, toss.
466800	467800	That's awesome.
467800	471800	Alec Baldwin is the opposite of hair, Alec hair loss.
471800	472800	Alec hair loss.
472800	475800	Bobby Moynihan again.
475800	476800	Bobby, step to the left.
476800	477800	Step to the right.
477800	478800	He did time to it.
478800	479800	And your undies tonight.
479800	480800	Bobby Moynihan.
480800	481800	The undies.
481800	482800	The undies.
482800	484800	I'm Alec Baldwin again.
484800	487800	I didn't have a different outfit so I took off my clothes.
487800	490800	Tina Fey.
492800	493800	That's cool.
493800	494800	All right.
494800	495800	Let's listen.
495800	498800	We've got a great show tonight.
498800	499800	Yeah.
499800	501800	There's no commercials because you're a subscriber.
501800	502800	There might be.
502800	506800	There will be commercials if, there might be funny fake commercials.
506800	507800	Yes.
507800	510800	I think we go right into a fake funny commercial right now, don't we?
510800	512800	Gold Bond Powder.
512800	513800	You guys have to do it while I get dressed.
513800	518800	That's the idea because I had to change outfits so you guys do the fake funny commercial.
518800	521800	Oh, my armpits.
521800	522800	They're so wet.
522800	524800	Hey, it's me.
524800	526800	Your armpit hairs.
526800	527800	Oh, hey.
527800	528800	You sound like that.
529800	534800	Your armpit hairs, whether or not you know this, your armpit hairs are from Brooklyn.
534800	537800	I am peristalsis.
539800	540800	Yeah.
540800	545800	We started a Kickstarter GoFundMe thing for you so you get some care and you get taken
545800	547800	care of for your sweaty armpit hairs.
547800	549800	What kind of product you got there in your pits?
549800	551800	Gold Bond Powder.
551800	552800	Oh, what's that?
552800	556800	It's a powder you put in your armpits so I don't fucking drown to death in your weird
556800	558800	diseased armpit sweats.
558800	560800	And you just find it yourself?
560800	566800	No, I have to go online to start the crowdfunding stuff for you guys.
566800	569800	That must take three or four clicks of a mouse.
569800	574800	Hey, you try being just a hair and try to click a mouse.
574800	576800	No.
576800	579800	I hope you die, you piece of fucking human shit.
579800	581800	Okay, I will.
581800	582800	I'm just kidding.
582800	583800	Gold Bond Powder.
583800	586800	You don't need to have your armpit hairs click on a mouse anymore.
586800	587800	Click, click.
587800	588800	Uh-oh.
588800	590800	Flood.
594800	600800	Now do the still photos, like the pose of Dan Harmon.
600800	603800	I got a pizza.
603800	605800	I don't want that.
605800	607800	Harmon Town is now in session.
607800	609800	All right.
609800	611800	Look, it's a work in progress.
611800	615800	So we're working on some of the kinks to our new format.
615800	619800	Our new format is mostly based in copyright infringement.
619800	626800	Yeah, I mean, well, look, we're not going to emulate the losers in the institutionalized comedy game.
626800	627800	We could try that.
627800	630800	I have a killer Miss Swan.
630800	632800	I mean, does anybody...
632800	633800	Can we hear it?
633800	635800	No.
635800	640800	I mean, was there an iconic opening to Mad TV?
640800	644800	I think they'd go like, why are you mad?
644800	647800	Like they worked their way around to...
647800	649800	Like every sketch, it's just not that.
649800	651800	People were impressed by that because they did that for 15 seasons.
651800	654800	Like, oh, the sketches always end with somebody getting mad.
654800	657800	But that's a pretty amateur thing.
657800	659800	I trained high school kids in improv.
659800	663800	Like they tend to want to fight or dance and wear props.
663800	665800	You got to encourage them to come out of their shell.
665800	669800	So the fact that every Mad TV sketch ends with someone getting mad...
669800	673800	Good idea for a theme, but not a feat.
673800	676800	It wasn't a sacrifice they were making, comedically.
678800	679800	What did I miss over the last two days?
679800	682800	I was up in the northwest.
682800	685800	I'd just been sitting...
685800	686800	How's Nigel?
686800	688800	With the little one.
688800	689800	Is he alive?
689800	690800	Is he recovering?
690800	691800	Is he all right?
691800	692800	Yeah, he's doing good.
692800	703800	I mean, I got to deal with all this shame.
703800	705800	When you own a dog...
705800	708800	I don't have kids, so a lot of people have kids.
708800	713800	Last I checked, at least 4 billion of them had them.
713800	718800	So it's got to be worse when it's a kid.
719800	723800	It just sucks because your dog starts acting weird
723800	726800	and then you got to choose whether to take them to the vet.
726800	730800	And then once you take them to the vet...
730800	733800	It's not their fault.
733800	738800	I'm sure the veterinarian industry is not flush with cash.
738800	744800	And I'm sure the doctors that are funneled into it are wonderful people.
744800	748800	And I'm sure the technicians that couldn't be doctors
748800	752800	at a veterinarian hospital yet are also great people.
752800	756800	And I'm sure the people that work at the front desk
756800	758800	that can't even be technicians,
758800	761800	that can't even be doctors that can't even have human patients,
761800	765800	I'm sure they're not five levels beneath normal humanity.
765800	768800	They're just five levels beneath a regular doctor.
768800	770800	And what is a doctor, as we've discussed on the show,
770800	773800	a serial killer with a support system?
773800	777800	A doctor is a person who's comfortable cutting things open.
777800	780800	The people that cut humans open are going,
780800	783800	oh look, that's what a bladder looks like.
783800	785800	Yeah, why do they call it Kaiser?
785800	787800	That's pretty, you know...
787800	789800	Kaiser? German.
789800	793800	It's also permanente, it's like an eternal Kaiser.
793800	795800	Kaiser is from Caesar.
795800	798800	Yeah, why are these people the ones that are trying to save our lives?
798800	801800	They want eternal empirical rule.
801800	803800	Yeah, they want a permanent Caesar.
803800	805800	They want to rule over your health.
805800	809800	Yeah, I mean, look, there's no question that doctors
809800	811800	know how to help you when you're sick,
811800	816800	but there's also no question that doctors are scientists,
816800	818800	they have to be.
818800	820800	And they're not...
820800	822800	What kind of person is drawn to an occupation
822800	827800	where you might have to be next to someone who's dying all the time,
827800	830800	or you might, or just sick, just, you know,
830800	833800	where every day you get up and go to work,
833800	836800	and it's just going to be nonstop problems,
836800	840800	and sick, desperate people looking for answers that you may or may not have
840800	844800	with you always rolling the dice with advice and diagnoses
844800	848800	and things that could either make or break the rest of your life
848800	850800	and pay off your student loans.
850800	853800	The kind of person that looks at that minefield and goes,
853800	856800	I think I'll go hang out in there, I'm not going to call them a sociopath,
856800	858800	I'm not going to call them probably also coincidentally
858800	861800	like the warmest person in the world.
861800	866800	Like, they probably have some pretty heavy fucking emotional armor on them.
866800	870800	Or, as I suspect, they enjoy suffering.
870800	872800	They love cutting open dogs.
872800	876800	Because the answer is, I think that most people follow their...
876800	880800	I mean, like, would you go into that field because it didn't hurt you,
880800	882800	or would you go into that field because you liked it?
882800	884800	I just think, I feel like they like...
885800	887800	I'm talking about regular doctors here.
887800	890800	I'm talking about people who are like, yes, I see you have a tumor.
890800	892800	I'm going to cut you open, pull it out.
892800	894800	Oh, look, there's your lungs, there's your heart.
894800	895800	I hope I don't make it stop beating.
895800	896800	Okay, sew them back up.
896800	897800	Okay, by the way, my name was Tony.
897800	898800	See you later.
898800	899800	I'm going golfing.
899800	901800	Come on, serial killer.
901800	903800	We had those people on the show that talked...
903800	906800	Like, they were EMTs that talked about they have...
906800	907800	We should have them back.
907800	910800	Like, they have injury porn that they send to each other.
910800	911800	Like, who can out-gross?
911800	912800	Well, now you humanize them.
912800	913800	They don't like that.
913800	916800	And EMTs, they don't get paid very much.
916800	917800	You know, we heard...
917800	919800	Like, those people are undoubtedly heroics,
919800	921800	and now you evened it up.
921800	924800	I mean, in fact, there are people that are willing to show up,
924800	928800	where people have, like, fucking just fallen down on the sidewalk
928800	930800	and no one knows what's wrong with them,
930800	932800	or hit themselves in the hand with a hammer.
932800	935800	They just find a dick and balls laying in the side of the road.
935800	937800	Like, or whatever. Like, God knows.
937800	941800	Was it your idea or Justin's to have Beth be a veterinarian
941800	942800	in Rick and Morty?
942800	946800	I can't remember.
946800	949800	I think that was a decision that was made
949800	953800	during the writing of the pilot, and...
953800	957800	It wasn't based on your current beef with veterinarians.
957800	958800	No.
958800	962800	And I don't really have a beef with...
962800	969800	I only have a beef with the species in general, if that.
969800	970800	Which, how can you?
971800	972800	It's not really a beef.
972800	975800	I'm just like, come on, it's as plain as the nose on our face.
975800	980800	Like, if you're poor and you are comfortable looking at guts,
980800	982800	you end up in prison.
982800	985800	If you're rich, you end up a doctor.
985800	989800	I don't know how anyone can argue with that.
989800	990800	Like, people go to medical school,
990800	993800	and then the people that aren't as comfortable looking at guts
993800	997800	as murderers fall down and faint, and then they go into research.
997800	999800	Yeah, a friend of mine, when I was going to college,
999800	1001800	maybe I've told the story before,
1001800	1006800	you have to go through, like, an actual autopsy
1006800	1010800	and watch a cadaver be, like, you know, totally taken apart.
1010800	1015800	And for the first time, these young students all walked in there,
1015800	1018800	and there was two doctors over it,
1018800	1020800	and the students didn't know,
1020800	1023800	because he was a dead human being,
1023800	1027800	and they had lined it with tin foil and filled it with spaghettios,
1027800	1031800	and when the students walked in, they were just eating out of the chest cavity
1031800	1033800	and eating spaghettios out of it,
1033800	1037800	and half the students ran out and barfed or fainted or whatever,
1037800	1039800	and that's a little joke.
1039800	1044800	Get used to not caring about the insides of people.
1044800	1050800	Yeah, you know, that's great that them noticing that they're sociopaths,
1050800	1054800	plus them having free time makes them want to have fun that way,
1054800	1057800	but another thing you could do with your free time if you're a sociopath
1057800	1059800	is learn empathy.
1059800	1062800	Like, you're smart, you learned all of the anatomy,
1062800	1066800	like, you learned how to turn your stethoscope into a bong,
1066800	1072800	like, maybe give them some seminars about humanity and stuff
1072800	1076800	and, like, how people that don't become doctors think and feel.
1076800	1079800	I told you about, like, Alice Flaherty, the neurologist,
1079800	1082800	she's like, we're not good with people,
1082800	1085800	we look at you in the way that you sit and the things that you say
1085800	1087800	or the things that are wrong with you,
1087800	1089800	you touch something that's cold, you think it's hot,
1089800	1091800	like, we're looking at your brain,
1091800	1093800	all we want to do is we're zombies,
1093800	1095800	we just want to take the top of your head off
1095800	1099800	and poke around in that big bowl of toothpaste, which is your brain,
1099800	1103800	like, we're not good with people, we just like solving the brain puzzle.
1103800	1105800	Like, if you were good with people,
1105800	1108800	you probably wouldn't be good at sawing off a head
1108800	1110800	and poking around in there.
1110800	1112800	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
1112800	1116800	So, these are the people that you have to take your dog to,
1116800	1118800	your dog can't talk, you take your dog to him,
1118800	1120800	and then, you know, it's probably a technician,
1120800	1122800	it's probably not even a doctor,
1122800	1124800	I don't know if a doctor's the one that has it,
1124800	1126800	it's like, I talked to three different doctors on the phone
1126800	1128800	over the three days that Nigel was at the hospital,
1128800	1131800	it's like, the bottom line is, I'm filled with a lot of toxic shame,
1131800	1139800	like, I took my dog to the hospital because he wouldn't stop trembling
1139800	1144800	and vomiting, he was vomiting so much that the equivalent for his size
1144800	1149800	would be like, you know, like, the middle, you know,
1149800	1154800	like, all across the stage except for your area and Spencer's area,
1154800	1157800	like, that much, which is, you know, I was like,
1157800	1160800	jeez, I mean, you know, it's time to go to the hospital,
1160800	1162800	like, he's never puked that much,
1162800	1167800	and he already had his issue with where he had, you know,
1167800	1170800	they had to pull out a clump of grass out of his intestines,
1170800	1173800	or did they have to? We'll never know, you know,
1173800	1176800	like, fans of the podcast will recall that story,
1176800	1180800	the punchline of it is, we're left to wonder for the rest of our lives,
1180800	1184800	should we have let the dog pass this giant clump of grass,
1184800	1186800	or would that have perforated his intestines on the way out
1186800	1189800	because it was moving so slowly, it was almost not moving at all,
1189800	1192800	do you wait for your dog to try to fit that out his asshole
1192800	1195800	and possibly cause permanent damage to him,
1195800	1198800	or would you cause permanent damage to him
1198800	1200800	by cutting him open and pulling it out?
1200800	1203800	That's what we opted to, so this is Nigel's second surgery,
1203800	1207800	second time he's been cut open by humans that he trusts,
1207800	1212800	and I just, and this time there was nothing in there,
1212800	1215800	there was, he was, you know, he was inflamed,
1215800	1217800	his stomach, the x-ray is stomach, and they go,
1217800	1219800	it's really big, do you think there's something in there,
1219800	1221800	did he eat anything that might be trapped in there,
1221800	1224800	because his stomach is gigantic and he said he's been puking a lot,
1224800	1227800	so like, we think there's something in there,
1227800	1229800	and I said, well, he eats a lot of stuff, so.
1229800	1231800	Would the x-ray show a thing or not a thing?
1231800	1233800	No, it doesn't show a lot of things,
1233800	1236800	as they condescendingly told me, like I even literally said,
1236800	1240800	I said, are you sure, is it possible,
1240800	1242800	it could be just inflammation that is making,
1242800	1244800	cause you're saying his stomach is big,
1244800	1246800	I didn't even know why I said that,
1246800	1248800	I didn't go to fucking medical school, I was just like,
1248800	1251800	cause I don't want to cut my dog open twice in a year,
1252800	1254800	and so I just, it was just kind of almost like,
1254800	1257800	it was just, it was just like, you think it could,
1257800	1259800	another reason, cause what they said,
1259800	1262800	they were using logic at midnight at an animal hospital,
1262800	1264800	so I'm thinking, I probably don't have the fucking Sherlock Holmes
1264800	1266800	of animal doctors, right?
1266800	1268800	Or maybe it's the Fox Mulder,
1268800	1271800	maybe they're so fucking smart about diagnosing animals
1271800	1273800	that people call them spooky, Dr. McGillicuddy,
1273800	1275800	and like make them work at midnight,
1275800	1277800	cause they're so fucking good at figuring out what's going on,
1277800	1279800	but they were scratching their heads,
1279800	1281800	your dog's stomach is huge,
1281800	1284800	and you said he just puked like the size of a pool table,
1284800	1287800	and so his stomach should be small, right?
1287800	1289800	Cause he puked all that, and I'm like,
1289800	1291800	this is, can I be a doctor?
1291800	1293800	And then I was like, well, is it possible
1293800	1295800	that the reason the stomach is large
1295800	1298800	is because it's irritated, is that a thing?
1298800	1302800	And the technician, I think there was a technician,
1302800	1304800	I don't think it was a doctor,
1304800	1307800	I don't know the difference, like honestly,
1307800	1310800	I perceived them looking at me like I was an idiot,
1310800	1312800	and they're like, yeah, well,
1312800	1315800	x-rays don't pick up inflammation, so.
1315800	1318800	And I was like, that wasn't an answer.
1318800	1321800	The answer that could have saved my dog a lot of pain
1321800	1323800	was, it's possible.
1323800	1326800	I didn't ask if x-rays picked up inflammation.
1326800	1328800	It's like when you go to the bank,
1328800	1330800	when you used to go to the bank,
1330800	1332800	and the people would say, yeah, the computer says no,
1332800	1334800	and you're just like, you're filled with this rage,
1334800	1336800	and go like, this isn't a computer interaction,
1336800	1337800	this is a human interaction.
1337800	1339800	I'm asking a human being a question,
1339800	1340800	stop pointing at your computer,
1340800	1342800	which you know God damn well if your computer
1342800	1344800	told you to jump out the fucking window,
1344800	1347800	you would pat it on the side.
1347800	1349800	You would go like, what's wrong with it?
1349800	1353800	If the screen flickered, which it might and sometimes does,
1353800	1356800	you wouldn't go, oh, time to kill myself.
1356800	1361800	Like, you're being lazy, and you're being condescending,
1361800	1363800	like, yeah, x-rays don't pick up inflammation.
1363800	1365800	I didn't ask if they did.
1365800	1367800	I asked if his stomach could be enlarged
1367800	1371800	because of inflammation, as opposed to a foreign object.
1371800	1374800	Do we think he ate a bowling ball?
1374800	1379800	I just think, just save my dog, save my dog.
1379800	1383800	So at the earliest absolute possibility,
1383800	1385800	a doctor called me on the phone then
1385800	1387800	after he stays there all night, and she goes,
1387800	1389800	yeah, the x-ray is stomach,
1389800	1391800	he's getting a little worse.
1391800	1393800	Stomach's getting, I don't know,
1394800	1397800	if there's something in there, it's not moving.
1397800	1400800	So like, maybe there's nothing in there.
1400800	1403800	Maybe it's inflammation.
1403800	1406800	And I'm like, but I'm talking to doctors now,
1406800	1408800	and I'm like, okay, so if there's something in there,
1408800	1410800	like last time it was a clump of grass,
1410800	1412800	and it was moving real slow.
1412800	1414800	And he's like, yeah, if this is a foreign object,
1414800	1416800	and you said he eats a lot of foreign objects,
1416800	1418800	I said, yeah, he ate a clump of grass at one point.
1418800	1420800	But it's not movement.
1420800	1422800	The x-ray would show if he ate a baseball.
1423800	1428800	It wouldn't, I mean, so they give me three choices.
1430800	1432800	Endoscopy, and then there's another choice
1432800	1434800	that was like an endoscopy,
1434800	1436800	but it's like they put something down his nose or something.
1436800	1439800	And like, both of those choices involved
1439800	1443800	keeping him the way he was and getting more information,
1443800	1445800	which now that I know,
1445800	1448800	I made the horribleest, most fucking awful choice.
1448800	1450800	Like, I just, I wanna cry.
1451800	1454800	But they don't recommend anything.
1454800	1456800	You ask them, what do you recommend?
1456800	1458800	And they might as well say out loud,
1458800	1460800	well, I don't wanna get sued.
1460800	1461800	It's your dog.
1462800	1465800	Yeah, so this whole system is based on two things,
1465800	1467800	total disrespect for the layman
1467800	1470800	and total burden on the layman with any kind of fucking risk.
1472800	1474800	We think you're an idiot
1474800	1478800	because we went to two years of dog school or something.
1479800	1482800	But so there's that, which is true.
1482800	1484800	I'm two years dumber than you
1484800	1487800	or whatever the fucking associate's degree you have
1487800	1490800	that has you working at midnight at a veterinary hospital.
1490800	1493800	And anybody who's watching who's going like,
1493800	1495800	my cousin works at a veterinary hospital,
1495800	1497800	I'm a veterinarian, I'm in school,
1497800	1499800	take your personal story
1499800	1502800	and just shove it all the way up your fucking dumb ass.
1502800	1505800	Because the fact that something is connected to your life
1505800	1507800	doesn't mean that you're outraged
1507800	1508800	doesn't mean that you have anything
1508800	1510800	to contribute to the conversation.
1510800	1512800	Otherwise, every time people were stupid
1512800	1514800	or had to deal with stupid people,
1514800	1516800	I'd lose my fucking mind
1516800	1518800	because I'm a fucking expert in that, okay?
1518800	1519800	So shut the fuck up.
1519800	1521800	I don't care if you're a veterinarian
1521800	1522800	and you're a fan of the show
1522800	1524800	and you're disappointed in my fucking closed-minded shit.
1524800	1527800	It's closed-minded because I'm fucking upset.
1527800	1528800	Shut the fuck up.
1528800	1531800	Stick your whole life up your ass.
1531800	1532800	Stick it all the way up.
1532800	1534800	And I hope it hurts going in
1534800	1536800	and then don't thread it through your mouth
1536800	1539800	so that you have a cosmic experience.
1539800	1543800	I want you to stumble around your front yard
1543800	1545800	with bandages on your arms
1545800	1548800	where their IVs were staring drug-addled
1548800	1550800	into the fucking cosmos,
1550800	1553800	wondering if the sound of the lawnmower is a threat or not
1553800	1555800	because you're on so many painkillers
1555800	1557800	and you can't speak English.
1557800	1559800	I want you to just walk around for two weeks
1559800	1563800	wanting to lick a bandage on your stomach
1563800	1565800	that everyone keeps telling you not to
1565800	1568800	and then finally just like finally have to take
1568800	1572800	a big diamond-plated fucking serrated shit
1572800	1575800	out of your own head and your own life,
1575800	1577800	out of your stupid ass.
1577800	1580800	I'm in fucking pain and so is my dog, so shut up.
1580800	1581800	I fucking hate veterinarians.
1581800	1583800	I hate myself.
1583800	1584800	I hate...
1584800	1586800	I'm filled with hate.
1586800	1588800	And I went to my therapist and I'm like,
1588800	1590800	I'm filled with hate, okay?
1590800	1594800	I'm filled with rage and shame.
1594800	1597800	And she's like, well, do this.
1597800	1600800	And I'm like, okay.
1600800	1602800	And I cried a little.
1602800	1605800	She's like, oh, she says, yell at the chair
1605800	1607800	like Clint Eastwood.
1607800	1609800	I'll come sit next to you.
1609800	1611800	She's like, okay, the veterinarian's in the chair.
1611800	1612800	Go ahead and yell.
1612800	1614800	And I go, I'm not gonna yell.
1614800	1616800	I'm in therapy to stop yelling.
1616800	1618800	You fucking nuts.
1618800	1620800	And she's like, what?
1620800	1622800	No, you're not in therapy to stop yelling.
1622800	1625800	You're in therapy to handle your emotions.
1625800	1627800	Like, well, I'm not gonna...
1627800	1630800	You may think it's cute or therapeutic to yell,
1630800	1636800	but I'm not gonna yell.
1636800	1640800	Your office is in a fucking apartment building in Los Feliz.
1640800	1642800	There's a yoga class next door.
1642800	1644800	And she's like, well, let me check about that.
1644800	1647800	She goes, nope, no yoga class.
1647800	1648800	Did you just fart?
1648800	1649800	Was that the chair?
1649800	1653800	Yeah, I just farted, and it sounded really loud.
1653800	1655800	Was it really a fart?
1655800	1660800	Yeah, it was, and it was stinky, too.
1660800	1662800	Dan, what I want you to do right now,
1662800	1665800	is I want you to yell at Spencer's fart.
1665800	1666800	Well, I don't know where it is.
1666800	1667800	Oh, God, it's in my...
1667800	1670800	No.
1670800	1672800	And then she goes, you know who will really like it
1672800	1674800	is the psychiatrist upstairs.
1674800	1677800	Oh, the guy that used to be in your bigger office,
1677800	1679800	or is it now in your bigger office?
1679800	1681800	So she doesn't mind me yelling.
1681800	1684800	I talk to the chair, and I vent a lot of the stuff
1684800	1685800	that I just vented.
1685800	1688800	And then at a certain point, yeah, I guess if I want to,
1688800	1691800	I can go...
1691800	1693800	And I do that, and she's like, okay,
1693800	1697800	now talk about what's right underneath that.
1697800	1698800	She said, how do you feel?
1698800	1701800	I said, 1 32nd better.
1701800	1705800	Like, 1 32th.
1706800	1707800	And it's already filled back up.
1707800	1709800	But she's like, well, wait, what's underneath that?
1709800	1710800	Is there something else?
1710800	1714800	Because if it's not all rage, if doing that doesn't help,
1714800	1716800	that means that you got rid of the rage layer.
1716800	1717800	What's underneath there?
1717800	1719800	And she was right about that.
1719800	1722800	I don't think my therapist is a bad therapist.
1722800	1724800	Like, there was shame underneath there.
1724800	1730800	I feel shame because I have to take care of this animal.
1730800	1731800	That's my job.
1731800	1733800	The animal can't express itself.
1733800	1735800	I have one fucking job.
1735800	1739800	And I started explaining why I was ashamed of myself.
1739800	1741800	And I started weeping.
1741800	1743800	And then she's like, now how do you feel?
1743800	1745800	And I'm like, 2 30...
1745800	1748800	Now a total of 1 16th better.
1748800	1749800	All right.
1749800	1750800	And now it's filled back up.
1750800	1753800	And she's like, okay, let's go outside.
1753800	1754800	Uh-oh.
1754800	1756800	She kicked your ass?
1756800	1758800	She fucking beat the shit out of me.
1758800	1760800	She hit me with it.
1760800	1764800	And it was a they live John Carpenter style fight.
1764800	1766800	So it ended up...
1766800	1768800	I had to pay extra because it was long.
1768800	1771800	Yeah, I actually paid her extra to do that.
1771800	1773800	Put the sunglasses on.
1773800	1774800	No, she makes me.
1774800	1775800	I don't want to say makes me.
1775800	1776800	I did it.
1776800	1778800	Partly because I was like, you really think...
1778800	1779800	I bet you think...
1779800	1780800	I felt like...
1780800	1782800	I was like, game theory.
1782800	1785800	She thinks this is like Good Will Hunting.
1785800	1788800	Oh, Dan Harmon's afraid to walk up and down the sidewalk
1788800	1790800	in his neighborhood in front of Matt Bronger
1790800	1794800	and Amy Mann and Patton Oswalt and Edgar Wright
1794800	1796800	like getting their coffee.
1796800	1799800	And yeah, he's not...
1799800	1801800	John Hamm is getting a ham sandwich.
1801800	1803800	He's not going to do this in front of John Hamm.
1803800	1806800	And I'm like, fuck, I did whatever she did twice as much.
1806800	1808800	She's like wiggling her arms like noodle man
1808800	1813800	and like walking like the keep on trucking drawing by a crumb.
1813800	1815800	And I'm like, yeah, it's like silly walks.
1815800	1818800	Like I was just like, okay, so you walk silly.
1818800	1819800	She's like, you feel that?
1819800	1820800	You feel that?
1820800	1823800	I'm like, yeah, I don't know, man.
1823800	1824800	What was she trying to get you to feel in this moment?
1824800	1825800	I don't know.
1825800	1826800	Like it was like the energy.
1826800	1827800	There's energy in your body.
1827800	1828800	And there's like...
1828800	1829800	The idea was like...
1829800	1832800	Because I kept saying, I don't know where to put this rage.
1832800	1835800	Because I have a couple holes in my wallet home
1835800	1837800	from when Fiv was sick, the cat.
1837800	1840800	And because it's like there comes a point
1840800	1841800	where you don't know how to express.
1841800	1844800	Like you have rage and shame that you don't know
1844800	1845800	where to put it.
1845800	1847800	It seems like there is no...
1847800	1849800	Like I'm a very sheltered person.
1849800	1851800	Like I don't have a lot of feelings that I don't know
1851800	1854800	how to get rid of in a proper way.
1854800	1858800	But like intense levels of rage and shame above a certain voltage.
1858800	1859800	There's no...
1859800	1860800	It's just like...
1860800	1864800	And I was just like, yeah, I still don't...
1864800	1865800	You can feel it.
1865800	1869800	You feel it in your heart, behind your eyeballs, in your fists.
1869800	1874800	Like you feel like you want to beat something.
1874800	1875800	You want to kill.
1875800	1879800	What is your shame about that you let Nigel down?
1879800	1880800	Yeah.
1880800	1881800	By...
1881800	1883800	By hiring people to stab him?
1883800	1886800	Or before...
1886800	1890800	Do you feel responsible for why he got whatever he got?
1890800	1891800	No.
1891800	1892800	Because you found out it was what?
1892800	1893800	It wasn't...
1893800	1894800	He didn't eat something.
1894800	1895800	It was like an allergy or something.
1895800	1897800	He has a condition called IBD.
1897800	1901800	But you know, at this point, whatever.
1901800	1902800	Like he's...
1902800	1905800	The thing that he is sick at home with right now
1905800	1907800	is a fucking stab wound in his stomach.
1907800	1909800	It's not what he went in with.
1909800	1915800	What he went in with is apparently a condition called IBD.
1915800	1916800	I don't know why...
1916800	1917800	Irritable bowel disorder?
1917800	1919800	I don't know if that's what it stands for.
1919800	1922800	It's basically like allergies, food allergies.
1922800	1924800	Like they say he ate something
1924800	1927800	and I think it could build up for a year.
1927800	1930800	Like so it's just got to fuck around with his diet and stuff.
1930800	1932800	Like it's doubtful that he ate.
1932800	1934800	No, that's not true.
1934800	1938800	It's possible that he ate some grass that he ate last time
1938800	1941800	or that era is also milk thistle
1941800	1944800	or some species of fucking California kumquat
1944800	1947800	that he fucking like found in a backyard.
1947800	1950800	And like it's possible that he ate one thing
1950800	1952800	that like shocked his system immediately.
1952800	1957800	It's also possible that over a year of having a little bit of chicken
1957800	1962800	or snail corpse or whatever, you know,
1962800	1964800	it's like oh this food's got TBDs
1964800	1968800	and this food's got IBKs and like IBKs.
1968800	1971800	TBDs is good.
1971800	1973800	What should we call this disease?
1973800	1976800	Of course by the way, everyone's so full of advice too.
1976800	1979800	And it's just like I don't want to say
1979800	1981800	take your advice and shove it up your ass.
1981800	1984800	Like I just want you to observe things from my perspective.
1984800	1986800	When your dog eats a bunch of grass
1986800	1989800	and has to have it surgically removed from his intestines,
1989800	1993800	I think I've already heard by now
1993800	1997800	that dogs eat grass when they're sick to induce vomiting.
1997800	2001800	I've also heard that that's fucking horse shit
2001800	2005800	and that dogs that eat grass end up sick from it.
2005800	2007800	Please shut up now.
2007800	2010800	It doesn't change anything being told this stuff.
2010800	2015800	You're not really helping anybody because you had a sick dog once.
2015800	2018800	I don't mean you should be ashamed of yourself.
2018800	2022800	I just shut up.
2022800	2025800	It's a fucking dog that starts shaking and vomiting.
2025800	2028800	You take him into idiots who are smarter than you
2028800	2031800	and you're given a choice between three doors
2031800	2032800	and one has a scalpel on it.
2032800	2035800	You choose the scalpel and they cut him open and they go,
2035800	2036800	oh nothing, sorry.
2036800	2038800	Yeah, he's got food allergies.
2038800	2040800	Zip, zip, so, so, so.
2040800	2044800	And now the dog's on doggy painkillers
2044800	2048800	and you can't touch him without him crying
2048800	2051800	and you just have to spoon feed him
2051800	2056800	little pieces of dog food that he'll barely eat.
2056800	2059800	You give him little spoonfuls of grass.
2059800	2062800	And you have nothing to think about that entire time
2062800	2064800	except what you did wrong.
2064800	2066800	You can run from your mistakes, everything else,
2066800	2068800	and you can fix by playing Minecraft.
2068800	2070800	I had a dog that kept eating grass
2070800	2072800	and would not stop eating grass, loved grass.
2072800	2075800	Favorite thing in the world ate grass all day, all night
2075800	2078800	and was constantly bummed out and constantly puking.
2078800	2081800	It's like, hey, we'll let you sort this out.
2081800	2083800	You're an idiot.
2083800	2087800	Also, when that dog was little, because we got this dog in New York,
2087800	2091800	we would be in Central Park and favorite food?
2091800	2092800	Horse shit.
2092800	2096800	The fucking handsome cabs that would go to take married couples down the lane.
2096800	2099800	Yeah, Nigel and the giant horse apples.
2099800	2103800	And this dog just loved eating, just couldn't get enough horse shit.
2103800	2104800	Nigel and Harvey.
2104800	2106800	The dog seemed so happy
2106800	2109800	and we didn't, like, want to stop the dog from being happy
2109800	2111800	but it was really embarrassing.
2111800	2114800	It's like, what's your dog problem?
2114800	2116800	Nigel and Harvey, every morning,
2117800	2121800	they bark at the neighbor's cat, Dash,
2124800	2127800	the cute little black and white cat
2127800	2129800	that I never told my neighbors.
2129800	2131800	I accidentally caught in a humane trap
2131800	2134800	when I was trying to catch a raccoon that was eating all my dog food.
2134800	2135800	Wait, wait, sorry.
2135800	2136800	Go back.
2136800	2139800	I went over to my neighbor's house once and I was like,
2139800	2140800	oh, that's your cat.
2140800	2141800	And I was like, the thought balloon.
2141800	2144800	I was like, I caught your cat in the trap once and let it go.
2144800	2145800	There's a raccoon once.
2145800	2147800	Yeah, there was a raccoon coming to the doggy.
2147800	2148800	It still is.
2148800	2150800	You almost murdered the cat back.
2150800	2151800	It almost murdered it.
2151800	2152800	Definitely.
2152800	2156800	I certainly gave it the most miserable night of its life
2156800	2162800	depending on when it took the bait that was for a raccoon,
2162800	2164800	which is a bunch of dog food.
2164800	2166800	It got caught in a cage and it was a humane trap.
2166800	2167800	It wasn't going to hurt.
2167800	2170800	It just came out to the backyard like, I got my prey.
2170800	2172800	And it was, yeah, anyways,
2172800	2174800	a very adorable outdoor cat named Dash.
2174800	2177800	Also, a bad name for a cat, Dash,
2177800	2179800	if you can't get out of a fucking trap.
2179800	2180800	No, come on.
2180800	2182800	You think trap sense would be a part of...
2182800	2185800	Anyways, the dogs, the dogs, when I'm working out in the morning,
2185800	2187800	they bark at Dash.
2187800	2188800	Dash comes up and they're like,
2188800	2190800	I'm always making fun of it because I'm like,
2190800	2191800	at this point, what do you think?
2191800	2195800	Remember we were talking about, what are the dogs saying to the cat?
2195800	2197800	Well, I just realized what they're saying to the cat
2197800	2200800	because I'm talking to Allison, the dog sitter,
2201800	2204800	she's like, you know, they fucking,
2204800	2205800	they love going out in the front yard
2205800	2207800	because they know the cat shit's out there
2207800	2210800	and they race each other to the cat shit.
2210800	2213800	It turns out when the dogs are barking at the cat through the front window,
2213800	2216800	they're like, you only got the Wells Fargo wagon.
2218800	2220800	I hope I got the reasons from Fresno.
2225800	2227800	Is my how to draw bug here yet?
2227800	2229800	Make a nice juicy one for me.
2229800	2232800	Cynthia, they're all up in that cat shit.
2232800	2234800	Yeah, they run out to the spot where he shits
2234800	2237800	and they fight over it like raptors.
2237800	2239800	What's in that cat poo that's so delicious?
2239800	2242800	I think that dogs, because they smell so intensely,
2242800	2244800	you have to think, you do the backwards math and go,
2244800	2247800	that means that if they could smell shit,
2247800	2250800	which they surely can because we can.
2250800	2252800	But they smell the ingredients in there.
2252800	2253800	They have to...
2253800	2254800	They're super tasters.
2254800	2258800	God gave them noses that could smell
2260800	2265800	the concern of a poodle an hour away
2265800	2269800	or that can smell their way home to...
2269800	2273800	If they get trapped in a U-Haul or whatever the stories are,
2273800	2277800	they can smell a forest fire in Utah.
2277800	2280800	And so we can smell a turd.
2280800	2283800	So then God's like, well, they're going to go nuts about the turds.
2283800	2284800	They're going to just kill themselves.
2284800	2285800	Like their nose will explode.
2285800	2288800	So then he's like, well, I can't make their nose less sensitive.
2288800	2291800	I mean, I really want these things to live by their nose.
2291800	2295800	All right, well, I'll just make them love it.
2295800	2297800	So that's why when they meet each other, they're like,
2297800	2299800	let me check out that asshole.
2299800	2301800	Wow, you got one coming, don't you?
2301800	2303800	It's cresting. I can see it.
2303800	2305800	Barbara, Cody's dog came over.
2305800	2308800	By the way, Nigel's dog, he's got...
2308800	2311800	Dogs come home from surgery. They're constipated.
2311800	2314800	He constipated in air quotes because he just doesn't want to squat
2314800	2315800	to take the shit.
2315800	2317800	He's got a fucking knife wound in his stomach.
2317800	2323800	But long story short, he's got a fucking little diamond tip turd.
2323800	2326800	You can see it if you look.
2326800	2329800	And then Barbara, Cody's dog, comes over
2329800	2331800	and she's just like right up in that ass.
2331800	2333800	I'm like, well, there's a turd coming out.
2333800	2335800	Do dogs like other dog shit?
2335800	2337800	Yes, they do. They like shit.
2337800	2340800	I don't think I've ever seen a dog eat another dog's shit.
2340800	2342800	Oh, no, I don't...
2342800	2344800	Do dogs eat their own shit?
2344800	2347800	Dogs that were raised in puppy mills...
2347800	2349800	Dogs eat their own shit if they've...
2349800	2352800	That's a heavy sign of abuse because they...
2352800	2353800	They're hungry.
2353800	2356800	Well, because dogs don't like the shit where they eat.
2356800	2358800	So dogs that are forced to shit where they eat,
2358800	2361800	eat their shit, especially mother dogs,
2361800	2364800	to keep the puppy mill cage sanitary.
2364800	2365800	It's really sad.
2365800	2368800	If you get a dog that's eating its own shit
2368800	2371800	and that's a red flag,
2371800	2375800	it's learned that behavior or it's personally experienced trauma.
2375800	2378800	Let's get away from this animal shit and bring up Rob Schraub.
2378800	2380800	Rob Schraub, everybody.
2380800	2384800	You know what dogs like eating shit the most?
2384800	2386800	German Shepherds.
2386800	2388800	Rob Schraub to the stage, everybody.
2393800	2397800	Oh, my God.
2398800	2400800	Holy shit.
2400800	2403800	He's been un-cheapy peeping.
2403800	2405800	Can we end this now?
2405800	2408800	Can I be your friend now?
2408800	2410800	Can we be friends?
2410800	2412800	Can we be friends again?
2412800	2415800	What does that iPad say? Is there an inscription?
2418800	2421800	I love you. Love, Steve.
2424800	2425800	Wait, what?
2425800	2427800	Worth it.
2427800	2430800	When you order an iPad, you can fill out an inscription thing.
2430800	2432800	And it's free.
2432800	2435800	Why did it become I love you, love, Steve?
2435800	2437800	That smacks of...
2437800	2440800	There was a little redundancy thing there.
2440800	2444800	I filled out a joke and then Steve also did.
2444800	2445800	Right.
2445800	2448800	It's like if you put by Dan and then it's by Dan again
2448800	2450800	because it automatically puts that.
2450800	2452800	Yeah, I don't know why Steve did that.
2452800	2454800	Couldn't Steve have just written I love you?
2454800	2456800	He could have done a lot of different things.
2457800	2460800	Let's run through some other things Steve could have done.
2460800	2462800	He could have got a B8.
2462800	2464800	I have a question.
2464800	2466800	Have a B8.
2466800	2472800	Am I released from this fucking weight?
2472800	2474800	Can I have my life back?
2474800	2476800	That's something only you can answer.
2476800	2478800	Can you call off your dogs, your Twitter dogs
2478800	2480800	and your Instagram commenters?
2480800	2482800	Can you call them off, please,
2482800	2484800	now that I've given your property back?
2484800	2490800	Thank you for allowing me to try it out.
2490800	2491800	It says Dan sucks on it.
2491800	2492800	No, it doesn't.
2492800	2493800	Yeah, it does.
2493800	2494800	Don't even start.
2494800	2499800	I'm trying to end this cruel...
2499800	2503800	It says I actually am a cheapy peepy.
2503800	2504800	See, you know...
2504800	2505800	That's crazy.
2505800	2506800	Why would you even do that?
2506800	2507800	I didn't do that.
2507800	2510800	Well, we know you were the last person to own it.
2510800	2512800	Spencer, you know I don't like that word.
2512800	2513800	Stop it.
2514800	2517800	It is one word, and I want to...
2517800	2518800	It's two words.
2518800	2522800	It's one word, and I want this to be over with.
2522800	2526800	Will you please set me free?
2526800	2529800	Can you unshackle me with it?
2529800	2531800	Can you do that?
2531800	2533800	Is there some sort of ritual or some cleansing
2533800	2534800	that we can go through?
2534800	2535800	Can you unshackle me?
2535800	2537800	Can I get unshackled?
2537800	2541800	Because I'm famous for my control over my fans.
2541800	2543800	And my fans are famous for loving me.
2543800	2545800	And they do what you tell them to.
2545800	2547800	They're famous for listening to what you say
2547800	2548800	and agreeing with it.
2548800	2550800	But you're in kind of a quicksand, Shrob,
2550800	2554800	because people Shrob you all the time.
2554800	2555800	I don't mind that.
2555800	2558800	I actually like that because they always do it wrong,
2558800	2560800	and I find it entertaining.
2560800	2562800	It's hard to Shrob right.
2562800	2564800	It's hard to do Shrobing funny.
2564800	2566800	How do you Shrob wrong again?
2566800	2568800	Because I see it happening all the time.
2568800	2569800	Let's try it.
2569800	2570800	Shrob, tweet something.
2570800	2572800	No, I can't.
2572800	2574800	You got me too stoned before.
2574800	2575800	Just tweet something out.
2575800	2576800	No.
2576800	2578800	You don't have the right glasses to type.
2578800	2579800	Improvise it.
2579800	2581800	You don't have to actually type it.
2581800	2586800	Just like fire off a mental, like a vocal tweet right now.
2586800	2588800	And then we're going to try to Shrob it
2588800	2591800	and prove that it's hard to Shrob things right.
2591800	2593800	Why don't you just read one of my...
2593800	2594800	Just tweet a tweet.
2594800	2597800	Hey, everybody, come and watch Harmon Town.
2597800	2599800	Sounds perfect.
2600800	2604800	Oh, are you going to be at Harmon Town?
2604800	2605800	Yes.
2605800	2607800	Now, is that him doing it wrong, or is it you?
2607800	2608800	I was trying to.
2608800	2609800	Yeah, that's doing it wrong.
2609800	2610800	That's not a...
2610800	2611800	That was bad, right?
2611800	2612800	Not to put you under too much pressure,
2612800	2614800	but can you now Spencer tweet something
2614800	2616800	and you do it right just to show it?
2616800	2618800	Spencer, fight on the Spencer tweet
2618800	2620800	and then Shrobs and then Shrob it.
2620800	2621800	I'm very...
2621800	2622800	It depends.
2622800	2623800	Sure, I'll try it.
2623800	2624800	Spencer.
2624800	2628800	Hey, look, I just got this new stack of Betamax tapes.
2630800	2632800	Did you get any Beta Minis?
2633800	2635800	There you go.
2635800	2636800	Do you see the difference?
2636800	2638800	Yeah, that's pretty good.
2638800	2640800	Yeah, but somebody might extrapolate from that
2640800	2645800	and go, oh, I get it, so you need to blah, blah, blah.
2645800	2651800	I think all you're saying is people try to be...
2651800	2655800	They try to reduce nuance to formula and it doesn't work.
2655800	2656800	I don't know.
2656800	2657800	They just don't know how to do it, right?
2657800	2659800	It's about timing and it's about...
2659800	2662800	It's picking the right tweet.
2662800	2665800	I'm a watch and wait predator.
2667800	2669800	You're like a jaguar on a limb.
2669800	2670800	Correct.
2670800	2671800	You pounce.
2671800	2672800	Can we get a T-shirt?
2672800	2673800	Yeah, you stalk and pray.
2673800	2675800	You can't just do anything.
2675800	2678800	Rob Shrob, watch and wait predator.
2678800	2680800	Well, I can't control my fans, Shrob.
2680800	2683800	However, I can control myself.
2683800	2684800	So I will say to you,
2684800	2686800	thank you for bringing the iPad back.
2687800	2694800	You established that you weren't using it anyway, so it is...
2694800	2695800	Which is kind of cheap.
2695800	2697800	I appreciate you bringing it back.
2697800	2700800	Otherwise, I would feel a little back because I just want you to be happy
2700800	2705800	and I would do anything to ensure that you keep coming back to the show
2705800	2710800	because it's been very helpful to me going through a transitional phase of my own.
2710800	2711800	I like having you here.
2711800	2714800	I've been a good friend of mine for a very long time.
2715800	2721800	If anything were to happen to either of us without me having expressed that,
2721800	2722800	it would be...
2722800	2725800	I don't know why I have to do this cadence where I'm like Richard Lewis
2725800	2726800	when I'm expressing affection.
2726800	2727800	Ira Glass.
2727800	2729800	But, you know...
2729800	2731800	He does that?
2731800	2737800	So for me, I riffed the phrase cheapy peepy.
2737800	2738800	It was insensitive.
2738800	2745800	And it's reductivist.
2745800	2747800	It's sexist.
2747800	2753800	And it's been now co-opted by some of the worst kinds of people,
2753800	2756800	people who like to see others feel pain.
2756800	2758800	A basket of deplorables.
2758800	2763800	I can't think of a worse word to apply to another human being, period.
2763800	2766800	Because it's so false.
2767800	2772800	I think of you as a very magnanimous, tranamus.
2772800	2774800	So you like that? You like that?
2774800	2775800	Thank you David.
2775800	2777800	Let's make that the new meme.
2777800	2779800	Remember when Harris Whittles...
2779800	2781800	Harris Whittles did...
2781800	2783800	There was a row...
2783800	2784800	It wasn't really a row...
2784800	2789800	You had a birthday and you had people that you like perform on your birthday
2789800	2792800	and you showed some stuff that you're proud of, like old shit.
2793800	2795800	It was kind of like the beginning of Harmontown.
2795800	2797800	Because you went up and you...
2797800	2799800	Did I go up even? I don't think I went up.
2799800	2801800	Yeah, you did.
2801800	2802800	Did I?
2802800	2803800	Yeah.
2803800	2804800	What did I do?
2804800	2808800	Well, you commented that Sarah Silverman was there, back...
2808800	2812800	It was Camille, Harris, Sarah, and you.
2812800	2813800	You closed it.
2813800	2814800	Was I a dick to Sarah?
2814800	2815800	No, no, no, no, no.
2815800	2816800	We hung up backstage, right?
2816800	2817800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2817800	2820800	You just said, I didn't know Sarah was gonna...
2820800	2822800	I would be following Sarah Silverman here.
2822800	2824800	It was like that, you know? I don't know.
2824800	2826800	Well, anyway, Harris did...
2826800	2830800	Harris's set was really funny because he went up and said,
2830800	2834800	I'm not gonna roast Rob because Rob's very sensitive.
2834800	2836800	You know, joke writers go to negative plays,
2836800	2839800	so like roast jokes are the funniest jokes.
2839800	2843800	But Rob's a very sensitive person, so I'm just gonna do...
2843800	2847800	I'm gonna try to roast Rob, but in a positive way.
2847800	2850800	And then he did a whole set of just jokes about,
2850800	2854800	Rob is such a good person and blah, blah, blah.
2854800	2859800	It was really funny because it was actually even, to me,
2859800	2863800	even more abusive because he was calling you a pussy
2863800	2868800	in a gigantic general sense and making a big show
2868800	2871800	of a kid gloving you, which is actually a great way
2871800	2874800	to hurt someone very deeply.
2875800	2877800	Yeah, he wasn't...
2877800	2880800	He didn't say anything untrue.
2882800	2884800	Does anybody own the tape of the roast for your birthday,
2884800	2885800	Dan, that we did?
2885800	2886800	I don't know.
2886800	2888800	At that Armenian restaurant in the valley?
2888800	2889800	I don't know.
2889800	2891800	My memory of that was that it was the funniest thing
2891800	2894800	that's ever happened, but I'm sure it's not.
2894800	2895800	Yeah, I'm sure it's not.
2895800	2898800	Comedy doesn't age well, but what was funny about it,
2898800	2900800	which is the thing that we do remember is that I turned 30,
2900800	2903800	we had a roast, and we specifically were like,
2903800	2905800	well, what if no one shows up?
2905800	2907800	We're like, well, why do we want anyone to show up?
2907800	2911800	All we want to do is have a dais.
2911800	2912800	We don't care.
2912800	2918800	So it was like three plus ones, like wives, husbands,
2918800	2922800	girlfriends, who had to sit there next to a salad bar
2922800	2927800	in the back of the Serbian restaurant and watch 10 guys
2927800	2930800	just piss themselves laughing while they,
2930800	2932800	for no reason at all, into a microphone
2932800	2935800	because there was no one to address except each other.
2935800	2943800	And facing an empty room just did roast jokes about Dan.
2943800	2946800	It was a roast of Dan Harmon, but as is the tradition,
2946800	2951800	everyone just did one Dan Harmon joke and then ripped everybody else.
2951800	2954800	Yeah, it's really fun.
2954800	2955800	Does that tape exist?
2955800	2957800	Do we know if anybody has that?
2957800	2958800	I don't know.
2958800	2960800	I have to imagine that if it exists,
2960800	2965800	it's filled with homophobia and racism and things that don't age well
2965800	2970800	because not only is it a roast, but it's a roast from 15 years ago,
2970800	2972800	and it wasn't made for television.
2972800	2975800	So I'm sure if we found it for our own purposes.
2975800	2978800	I'm not saying we released this to the general public.
2978800	2982800	I'm saying, do we have the courage to watch this together?
2982800	2984800	That was a symptom of my disease that you're like,
2984800	2986800	I wonder if that tape exists that I'm immediately leaping to.
2986800	2987800	The world would hate it.
2987800	2989800	They're like, well, that's not about the world.
2989800	2990800	It's about our friendship.
2990800	2992800	We could watch it and then burn it in a trash can afterwards.
2992800	2996800	Yeah, or just keep it and wait until it's funny again in 50 years
2996800	2999800	when people are so equal and free that everyone's like,
2999800	3001800	that is hysterical.
3001800	3004800	So that's what you called a gay joke.
3004800	3006800	So the joke was just that everyone was gay,
3006800	3008800	and then it turned out to be true.
3008800	3010800	I get it.
3010800	3011800	You're joking about Chris Tomlin.
3011800	3013800	He's like, yeah, Chris Tomlin, Dan had a joke.
3013800	3016800	Chris Tomlin's bad with the ladies.
3016800	3018800	Chris, we have all of our friends.
3018800	3020800	We have a bedding pool going on.
3020800	3023800	What's going to last longer, your virginity or Saturn?
3029800	3030800	I saw A Quiet Place.
3030800	3032800	You hear about this Quiet Place movie?
3032800	3035800	I heard about it, but then I forgot about what it's about.
3035800	3036800	What is it?
3036800	3038800	It's about A Quiet Place.
3038800	3039800	Thank you, Spencer.
3039800	3041800	There's like, I'm right there.
3041800	3042800	It's in like, like, I don't know.
3042800	3043800	I think it's like 20.
3043800	3045800	It's like, it's like in five years.
3045800	3047800	Oh, this is just quiet.
3047800	3049800	This is Dunder Mifflin guy.
3049800	3052800	If you make a sound, you get eaten by the ladies.
3052800	3055800	So the first, like, half hour of it is...
3055800	3056800	Sign language.
3056800	3057800	...silented sign language and whispering.
3057800	3058800	And it's really effective.
3058800	3059800	It's really...
3059800	3062800	I really enjoyed it quite a bit.
3062800	3066800	So I want to ask a question about it as a sci-fi horror fan.
3066800	3068800	And as a big rules guy.
3068800	3071800	You know, we talked a lot about zombie movies with Kirkman.
3072800	3077800	And I'm not going to say if the answer is yes.
3077800	3079800	Oh, the movie sucks or whatever.
3079800	3083800	But I just like, what I will do is throw a parade if the answer is no.
3083800	3087800	Are there inconsistencies in the rules of these things?
3087800	3091800	Like a lot of times in movies like that where there's rules that are so clear cut.
3091800	3096800	It's like, is there a scene where the person is like in the corner and it's like...
3096800	3102800	You know, the Foley person is like making their breath dramatic.
3102800	3103800	But it's like, well, come on.
3103800	3108800	You did a whole scene earlier about how literally a pin dropping could have brought them.
3108800	3110800	I thought it would...
3110800	3115800	You might watch it and go, hey, Shrob, I can hear her breathing.
3115800	3118800	You know, I thought it was very consistent.
3118800	3125800	I thought it was a very simple rule to this creature that you make any noise.
3125800	3131800	I mean, they spend a long time setting up the world before they ever introduce the other thing.
3131800	3134800	It's like they're walking around barefoot.
3134800	3139800	They have like these pre-made sand paths.
3139800	3144800	So they're not like stepping on twigs and going through the forest and stuff.
3144800	3150800	And it's just, it is a great monster that's new, which I really like.
3150800	3153800	Do you get to see him before the...
3153800	3154800	Yeah, you get to see...
3154800	3156800	Yeah, spoiler probably.
3156800	3158800	A decent look at him, you know.
3158800	3162800	Is it true, Rob, that you've been asked to make a sequel to it called Don't Make a Peepy?
3166800	3167800	Is there...
3167800	3169800	If I started crying right now, would you feel bad?
3169800	3170800	That would be awesome.
3170800	3171800	Would you laugh?
3171800	3172800	I'd laugh.
3172800	3173800	I'm just curious.
3173800	3174800	It's more...
3174800	3175800	It says more about you.
3175800	3176800	Well, I can't wait to see it.
3176800	3177800	I mean, I love...
3177800	3178800	It's really good.
3178800	3180800	I saw Isle of Dogs.
3180800	3181800	Stop.
3182800	3184800	Oh, that's Wes Anderson.
3184800	3185800	Yeah.
3185800	3186800	Yeah.
3186800	3187800	I kind of agree with...
3187800	3192800	I can't remember if it was Lauren Duka or like tweeted like, well, I want to see a Wes Anderson
3192800	3193800	movie about animals, but...
3193800	3196800	And then a list of like, are you...
3196800	3197800	Is there going to be...
3197800	3201800	I mean, it just seems like a setup for a fucking heartbreak.
3201800	3204800	No, there's...
3204800	3205800	It's a really good...
3205800	3207800	I really liked it a lot.
3207800	3213520	I think you as a Starburnt co-owner might want to check it out because it's...
3213520	3217800	I thought it was just beautifully designed and it...
3217800	3221240	There's some off-putting stuff, you know, with Dog.
3221240	3222920	I just am very sensitive to that.
3222920	3223920	So...
3223920	3224920	But I think it's done...
3224920	3225920	Is it animation?
3225920	3226920	Yeah.
3226920	3227920	It's stop motion animation.
3227920	3228920	Yeah.
3228920	3236680	And they do a bunch of stuff up front that I kind of was like, ugh, god, oof.
3236680	3238440	And I think they're saying like, this...
3238440	3242200	If you brought kids to this, you should probably take them out, you know, because it's...
3242200	3245120	But the voice talent is great.
3245120	3247560	I just think it's a beautiful, well-designed film.
3247560	3250320	I love the Wes Anderson loves stop motion.
3250320	3251920	Is it literally stop motion or is it...
3251920	3252920	Yeah.
3252920	3253920	Yeah.
3253920	3254920	That's great.
3254920	3255920	It...
3255920	3256920	I mean, like the fur is all moving.
3256920	3257920	It looks clunky.
3257920	3258920	I mean, like, it's like...
3258920	3262600	I don't know if you saw the Mr. Fox movie that he did.
3263600	3268720	I can now admit that I haven't seen it yet because the guy I would have offended that
3268720	3273120	I would have been working with, I think, now has to...
3273120	3279320	The movie Tike is doing for us, the Bubbles movie.
3279320	3280320	It's co-director.
3280320	3282600	It was the co-director of Mr. Fox.
3282600	3285600	I haven't seen Mr. Fantastic Fox, man.
3285600	3287840	I've never seen it.
3287840	3288840	That one's fun, too.
3289600	3292960	I love stop motion animation.
3292960	3294200	I just love the model building.
3294200	3296520	I think it's just really great.
3296520	3297520	It's amazing.
3297520	3306440	Speaking of segues, the reason why Tike Waititi, world's most sought after director, of course
3306440	3308600	his next movie is for me.
3308600	3315040	Well, after a quick hop over to Prague where he's going to make his amazing Hitler movie,
3315040	3317040	but he's going to...
3317040	3318800	It's called The Amazing Hitler Movie?
3319760	3322480	I think it's going to be truly...
3322480	3326360	It's going to be pretty...
3326360	3333160	His description of the movie, to me, made me really jealous for the first time in a
3333160	3337120	long time of another guy my age.
3337120	3341000	I was just like, God, you're just fucking doing what you want.
3341000	3347040	It really made me spiritually jealous as opposed to, oh, he has a Tesla.
3347800	3351320	I was like, ah, fuck, I'm creatively jealous of someone.
3351320	3355440	You just finished your Thor movie and now you're going to go make this fucking thing.
3355440	3357480	I think people are going to be blown away by it.
3357480	3362080	Then he's going to do our Michael Jackson monkey movie over here.
3362080	3364720	I know that chimpanzees are apes, not monkeys.
3364720	3367040	Put your fucking life up your ass.
3367040	3369160	Oh, man.
3369160	3370160	Write us in...
3370160	3373880	Until a shitty veterinarian has to cut it out and see how you feel.
3373880	3376920	Write us in if chimpanzees aren't monkeys.
3377800	3379680	Write us in on the election.
3379680	3382480	The problem is that they look exactly like monkeys.
3382480	3385080	Yeah, let's just call them all monkeys for Christ's sake.
3385080	3386480	Like you didn't know what I meant.
3386480	3388680	Yeah, like you didn't know what I meant.
3388680	3391400	Why is language so living?
3391400	3392560	Exactly.
3392560	3399720	But we're getting evicted by this piece of shit studio, Starburns.
3399720	3402880	I don't know who's running this fucking place, but...
3402880	3407320	We're leaving Starburns Castle and we mentioned it last week.
3407320	3411840	Yeah, and if you can't hear the silent cries of the audience we're not allowed to have
3411840	3417600	in here, believe me, they're happening in the ether with that ghost bee from our second
3417600	3418600	sketch.
3418600	3419600	What's the next step for us?
3419600	3420840	I'm kind of excited about it.
3420840	3426600	We toured a place, I don't know, I don't want to speak out of school, so we went over there
3426600	3427600	and looked at it.
3427600	3429200	Is this the one kind of downtown-ish-ish?
3429200	3430200	Yeah.
3430200	3431200	It's kind of downtown-ish-ish.
3431200	3434200	I met with an agent and he's like, if you guys need a new space, there's this place
3434200	3435200	and it's the same place.
3435200	3436200	Okay, yeah.
3436200	3437200	I mean...
3437200	3438200	Oh, it's popping off.
3438200	3440080	I don't know why it would be secret, but just in case, I don't want to...
3440080	3441080	It's called...
3441080	3442080	It rhymes with...
3442080	3443080	No, it doesn't.
3443080	3444080	It rhymes with Maples Mentor.
3444080	3445080	It doesn't.
3445080	3446080	He's lying.
3446080	3447080	It's the Staples Center.
3447080	3448080	We're going to the Staples Center.
3448080	3449080	He's lying.
3449080	3450080	It's not that...
3450080	3451280	We haven't locked it down yet and don't say Staples Center yet.
3451280	3456160	I think that our LA fans will be excited, would be excited to be able to come see us
3456160	3458360	even if it was in a shit hole.
3458360	3460960	This place is not a shit hole.
3460960	3467000	It's really nice and it seems like it's run by good people.
3467000	3477280	I think our next home very likely will be a rebirth of this show as not what it was
3477280	3478280	at Meltdown.
3478280	3479280	I knew...
3479280	3483480	It's like we were something at Meltdown, then we came here and we're kind of building to
3483480	3487960	God knows what and then collapsed into this cocoon phase where we found out we don't care
3487960	3493660	if anyone is in the audience, which is a cool thing to find out, but the reason it's
3493660	3498360	cool is because it allows you to miss the audience and then maybe we can now go in front
3498360	3500720	of an audience again and not be...
3500720	3503820	I won't be as fucking...
3503820	3510000	Maybe I can be a little more Spalding Grey, a little less...
3510000	3514480	Speaking of audiences, Dan, while I remember this, we have to talk about...
3514480	3515920	We're doing a show in Boston.
3515920	3516920	Oh shit.
3516920	3520440	Friday, June 22nd will be the awesome Wilbur Theater.
3520440	3524240	We're going to be at the Wicked Retarded Fium.
3524240	3530280	The show's going to be a Wicked Pisser.
3530280	3533040	It's probably going to be...
3533040	3538080	The Boston Herald is calling it the most retarded show coming to...
3538080	3541640	And that publication, they used that phrase and they mean good.
3541640	3545480	Yeah, they rated it on one to five Retarded people.
3546480	3549000	This has five Retarded people on it.
3549000	3550640	It's a five Retarded show.
3550640	3551640	It's going to be Wicked.
3551640	3552640	It'll probably be some Pisser.
3552640	3557320	There's going to be lobster rolls and it's going to be good.
3557320	3560120	I played the Wilbur Theater before.
3560120	3561120	It's an awesome theater.
3561120	3563200	It's a really, really fun venue.
3563200	3565520	Have we been at the Wilbur with this show?
3565520	3566520	No.
3566520	3568040	Where were we when we went to Boston last?
3568040	3572240	That was on our tour and Adam Goldberg's brother came up.
3572240	3574600	We were in Somerville.
3574720	3576720	We were at Jay's Laughs station.
3576720	3578720	So we've never been in Boston proper?
3578720	3579720	Prappa.
3579720	3580720	Prappa?
3580720	3582120	We've never been in Boston Retarded?
3582120	3586160	No, we were not Wicked or a Pisser.
3586160	3589760	So we could get beaten up or achieve independence?
3589760	3590760	Or both.
3590760	3593160	Or, yeah, probably both.
3593160	3595400	Or asked to share in casual racism.
3597800	3602360	So come see us and kill us at the Boston Wilbur Theater on Friday, June 22nd.
3602360	3603960	You've got to eat that mic, you fucking...
3603960	3604960	So Long Island...
3604960	3605960	Wicked retards.
3606960	3607960	Don't.
3607960	3608960	Don't.
3608960	3612960	My sister's retarded with a hard R, so...
3612960	3617840	Also, we're going to be in Long Island somewhere at the Aviation Museum.
3617840	3618840	What the fuck is it?
3618840	3620800	We're going to be in the air.
3620800	3624400	The 23rd, we're going to be in Long Island and it's...
3624400	3626600	Google Harmentown, Long Island, Ticketmaster.
3626600	3630960	Go online and do it like a regular person, you pieces of garbage.
3630960	3632960	Yeah, that'll be wrong.
3633960	3635960	Yeah, they're not pieces of garbage.
3635960	3636960	And that's because...
3636960	3638960	Wait, what is it?
3638960	3639960	Why are we...
3639960	3640960	I don't mean to say, why are we doing that?
3640960	3641960	Like, we shouldn't be.
3641960	3642960	I just mean like...
3642960	3643960	We're at an aviation...
3643960	3644960	Oh, we're doing...
3644960	3645960	I think it's a charity thing.
3645960	3646960	We're going to do that...
3646960	3647960	Is that a charity thing?
3647960	3648960	That planetarium thing.
3648960	3650960	Oh, the planetarium thing at the Aviation Flim Flam.
3650960	3652960	It's a charity event for what?
3653960	3654960	Stem cell research.
3654960	3655960	No.
3657960	3660960	Science, technology, education, and medicine.
3661960	3665960	We're doing a benefit show.
3665960	3668960	It's all the stem cells you can eat.
3668960	3671960	Better find out before the show.
3671960	3674960	We're pretty sure it's about science, education, and women.
3674960	3676960	Those are ingredients we like.
3676960	3677960	It's like a casserole.
3677960	3678960	Like, you can't go too wrong.
3678960	3682960	And it's aviation themed, so we can actually talk about going to the moon finally.
3682960	3684960	Also, we get to do a show in a planetarium.
3684960	3685960	Yeah.
3685960	3689960	Are we going to turn the lights down and play Pink Floyd and shit and look at the ceiling?
3689960	3690960	We will, yeah.
3690960	3694960	And we're going to bring pot brownies.
3695960	3699960	Let's get there early and work with the lighting crew and see what we can do.
3699960	3703960	We're going to get there early and work with the lighting crew and see what we can do.
3703960	3707960	And also, if you're naked, Rob Shrob has some t-shirts.
3708960	3709960	Oh, yeah.
3710960	3714960	Tea Public, Rob Shrob, Shrob Home Video.
3715960	3718960	New t-shirt design came out last week.
3718960	3719960	Yeah, what does that say?
3719960	3721960	Chinese murder van.
3722960	3724960	Really burning up the charts.
3724960	3727960	All the proceeds go to purchase a Chinese murder van.
3727960	3728960	Right.
3728960	3729960	We want to support that.
3729960	3731960	We're going to get rid of the mean streets of Burbank.
3731960	3736960	All proceeds go to benefiting the people in Boston who are truly wicked retarded.
3736960	3737960	Right.
3737960	3746960	It's kind of like that charity where they rescue dogs from countries where they eat them.
3746960	3748960	But we're going to China.
3748960	3751960	We want to buy a van, one of these Chinese murder vans.
3751960	3752960	Right.
3752960	3754960	We just want to take it off the streets of China.
3754960	3758960	We're going to fucking pimp it out and roll it up and down the streets of Burbank.
3758960	3762960	It's going to be a new show on The Learning Channel called Pimp My Chinese Murder Van.
3762960	3763960	Right.
3763960	3767960	Everybody knows there's a constitutional right to own a Chinese murder van.
3767960	3769960	Because in America, it's called an ambulance.
3769960	3770960	Right.
3771960	3773960	It's called a veterinarian van.
3773960	3774960	Yeah.
3774960	3775960	Rick.
3775960	3776960	Rick Ashley.
3776960	3777960	Rick Ashley.
3777960	3778960	Who's that?
3778960	3780960	Who's Rick Ashley?
3780960	3782960	A symptom of your stroke.
3785960	3786960	Never get asked.
3786960	3787960	Never get asked.
3787960	3788960	Ask Ashley.
3788960	3789960	Yeah.
3789960	3790960	I mean, I know.
3790960	3791960	He's having a stroke.
3791960	3792960	Oh, no.
3792960	3795960	I always wondered when we were living in Milwaukee, I always wondered like, like, Shropp and I
3795960	3796960	would joke.
3796960	3797960	We were in our 20s.
3797960	3798960	Oh, we do.
3798960	3803960	Every once in a while, we'd allude to, as friends do, the image of us on a porch and rocking
3803960	3805960	chairs, drinking lemonade.
3805960	3806960	This is it.
3806960	3807960	Yeah.
3807960	3808960	But this is it.
3808960	3809960	This is it.
3809960	3812960	I mean, I'm looking at her image.
3812960	3815960	I think we could create beers and glasses.
3815960	3818960	I mean, this is what we would dress up as.
3818960	3819960	I like this, though.
3819960	3820960	This is good.
3820960	3821960	I like this porch.
3821960	3823960	I'm fine with living this long.
3823960	3824960	Yeah.
3824960	3825960	What's the future of this beard, Robbie?
3825960	3827960	Are you going to just do its own thing?
3827960	3832960	I got my first, I don't know, from Kate.
3832960	3835960	Oh, which is probably the death of it.
3835960	3836960	I mean, I'm fine.
3836960	3838960	I mean, she was like, yeah, I'm fine with it.
3838960	3839960	It's cool.
3839960	3841960	You know, it's all right, man.
3841960	3843960	Man, you look good.
3843960	3845960	That's what Sophie's mom said.
3845960	3847960	Mom said you look handsome.
3847960	3851960	Your impression of your wife sounds like Howard Stern's impression of a black person.
3851960	3852960	Hey, man.
3852960	3853960	Hey.
3853960	3854960	Hey, man.
3854960	3855960	Hey, man.
3855960	3856960	This is me.
3856960	3857960	That's real groovy, man.
3857960	3859960	That's real groovy, man.
3859960	3861960	I loved your wife on Starsky and Hutch.
3861960	3862960	Hey.
3862960	3863960	Hey.
3863960	3864960	Hey, Shrav.
3864960	3867960	You're going to pick up your socks.
3867960	3871960	I've been chipping over your socks every morning.
3871960	3872960	Pick up your socks.
3872960	3876960	You're all balled up to sock wearing motherfucker.
3876960	3877960	Yeah.
3877960	3878960	So she finally...
3878960	3884960	I have to be careful what you wish for myth happening with Cody.
3884960	3890960	The older I get, the longer my hair gets, the longer my beard gets.
3890960	3893960	She's just like, I like it.
3893960	3896960	She got bummed out when you cut your beard out.
3896960	3903960	I was trying to do a little trimming thing, and I did one of those things where I shaved
3903960	3906960	too much on one, and then I tried to even it out.
3906960	3910960	You can hear about all of it on our friend Rob Tanchum's upcoming album.
3910960	3913960	He says a rap about an uneven shave.
3913960	3915960	Church can't wait for my hair to get gray.
3915960	3917960	My hair's getting gray gradually, but Church wants...
3917960	3920960	You want me to be an old man, don't you?
3920960	3921960	Yeah.
3921960	3922960	She actually...
3922960	3923960	She goes out of her way.
3923960	3925960	She just stressed me out, so I just...
3925960	3931960	She sets a vibrating alarm so that she can wake up in time to be at the foot of your
3931960	3935960	bed at 3.30 in the morning holding a butcher knife.
3935960	3940960	It's like watering a plant when you want your man to get white hair.
3940960	3943960	She's just going to gradually, like, Stephen King you.
3943960	3945960	Have you seen Annihilation?
3945960	3946960	No.
3946960	3948960	Can you explain it to me?
3948960	3949960	Yes.
3949960	3950960	It's 9-11.
3950960	3952960	It's pronounced Annihilation.
3952960	3954960	Annihilation.
3954960	3956960	Have you seen a 9-11?
3956960	3958960	What question do you have?
3958960	3959960	What does it...
3959960	3960960	It's 9-11, everybody.
3960960	3961960	You know what that means.
3961960	3964960	It's time to drink Coors Light.
3964960	3965960	Coors Light.
3965960	3967960	And pop some hymns.
3967960	3971960	Crack open a nice, cool, tall glass of meandis.
3971960	3973960	I was talking to a Broadway composer.
3973960	3974960	Lin Manuel.
3974960	3975960	No.
3975960	3977960	Lin Manuel Lin.
3977960	3979960	I won't say yes.
3979960	3981960	I won't say no.
3981960	3986960	Lin Manuel's Wario is out there.
3986960	3989960	I don't like the Constitution.
3989960	3991960	My music is bad.
3991960	3993960	It doesn't rhyme or anything.
3993960	3996960	It's going to be all country western about how the Constitution is bad.
3996960	3999960	Lin Manuel Lin.
3999960	4002960	He's Cap Azrael.
4002960	4004960	And he's talking about...
4004960	4005960	9-11.
4005960	4007960	He's telling a story about...
4007960	4008960	Whatever.
4008960	4009960	It doesn't matter.
4009960	4010960	No, go on.
4010960	4012960	He was telling a story about the timing of a thing.
4012960	4013960	And then he said...
4013960	4019960	Broadway people refer to 9-11 a lot because the history of Broadway was heavily affected.
4019960	4021960	It's like, don't break a leg.
4021960	4022960	I did the joke.
4022960	4026960	That's what they say before you go on stage instead of saying good luck.
4026960	4027960	Hit a tower.
4027960	4028960	9-11.
4028960	4029960	No.
4029960	4030960	9-11.
4030960	4032960	It's in the timeline of Broadway.
4032960	4033960	Broadway's ups and downs.
4033960	4036960	Obviously 9-11 is a marker in that timeline.
4036960	4041960	There were 9 ups and 11 downs on Broadway.
4041960	4046960	And coincidentally, Broadway stopped on 9-11.
4046960	4048960	There's no Broadway anymore.
4048960	4049960	What?
4049960	4050960	All right.
4050960	4056960	Sometimes I bring something up and I'm like, God, I wish they'd just let me finish.
4057960	4060960	And then sometimes I bring something up and I'm like, well, it's going to be conspicuous
4060960	4063960	that I don't finish, but I'm glad they didn't let me finish.
4063960	4064960	Which one was this?
4064960	4065960	You should finish.
4065960	4066960	The latter.
4066960	4067960	The latter.
4067960	4069960	So let's do the sketch.
4069960	4073960	Let's do the sketch with Shrob, the post office sketch.
4073960	4074960	Okay.
4074960	4076960	We've worked on this a lot.
4076960	4077960	I'm off book.
4077960	4078960	You guys are...
4078960	4079960	I'm good.
4079960	4080960	I'm good.
4080960	4081960	It's a live show.
4081960	4084960	Sometimes people break up, they start laughing.
4084960	4089960	But those people get fired or stay on the show for 20 seasons.
4089960	4092960	It depends on whether they're popping.
4092960	4094960	All right.
4094960	4095960	I'm locking tonight.
4095960	4097960	Chris, can we get lights down?
4097960	4098960	Let's do this.
4098960	4099960	Do the post office sketch.
4099960	4100960	Post office sketch.
4112960	4113960	Come in.
4113960	4114960	It's a post office.
4114960	4115960	Excuse me.
4115960	4116960	I'd like to mail this.
4116960	4117960	Okay.
4117960	4118960	Whoo.
4118960	4119960	Sorry.
4119960	4120960	You can...
4120960	4121960	Was that the studio audience?
4121960	4122960	Mail whatever you want, sir.
4122960	4123960	I'd like to.
4123960	4124960	Okay.

4136960	4137960	Excuse me.
4137960	4139960	Excuse me.
4139960	4140960	Excuse me.
4140960	4146960	I'd like to mail this box here.
4146960	4147960	Okay.
4147960	4148960	Well, we need to weigh it.
4148960	4149960	It's...
4149960	4152900	I'd like to wear the box here.
4152900	4153960	Is it a mock chair?
4153960	4155960	A mock chair.
4155960	4157960	A boc-cha-hair.
4157960	4158960	Yeah.
4158960	4160960	Are you going to mail a boc-cha-hair?
4160960	4161960	Well, look.
4161960	4163960	I don't need to know what it is.
4163960	4164960	Media mail.
4164960	4169960	I am kind of a meteor man in the sense that I...
4169960	4170960	Media.
4170960	4171960	Media man.
4171960	4174960	In a media man.
4174960	4176960	It's a meteor man.
4176960	4178960	It sounds like you got a meteor man.
4178960	4179960	Yeah.
4179960	4180960	In the back.
4180960	4184960	Well, that's...
4184960	4186960	That's my boss's office chair.
4186960	4187960	It's...
4187960	4189960	A lot of people think that it's him farting, but...
4189960	4190960	Oh!
4190960	4191960	Oh!
4191960	4192960	Oh!
4192960	4193960	Oh!
4193960	4194960	No!
4194960	4195960	No!
4195960	4196960	Okay.
4196960	4201960	Well, let's take that meteor man behemoth chair and...
4201960	4202960	Oh!
4202960	4205960	Looks like that weighs about five pounds and depending...
4205960	4207960	Depending on where...
4207960	4208960	Uh-huh!
4208960	4209960	Uh-huh!
4209960	4212960	Depending on where you're mailing that.
4212960	4213960	Will...
4213960	4215960	Have you filled out an address form?
4215960	4216960	No!
4216960	4217960	No, no.
4217960	4218960	Well...
4218960	4219960	You should...
4219960	4220960	You should...
4220960	4221960	You should...
4221960	4222960	Okay.
4223960	4226960	That was such a long...
4226960	4230960	Long casual but also loud laugh.
4230960	4231960	Whoa!
4231960	4232960	Okay.
4232960	4233960	They don't like being self-aware.
4233960	4234960	All right.
4234960	4235960	All right.
4235960	4236960	That's...
4236960	4237960	All right.
4237960	4238960	All right.
4238960	4242960	It sounded like some of them didn't like it towards the end there.
4242960	4243960	It's...
4243960	4244960	Dead.
4244960	4246960	So let's fill out this form.
4246960	4247960	Uh-huh.
4247960	4248960	Uh-huh.
4248960	4249960	I need a pen.
4249960	4250960	That and utensil.
4250960	4251960	Yeah.
4251960	4252960	There's a pencil.
4252960	4254960	You just put your...
4254960	4257960	Put the address you want to send it to on one side and the address that you're...
4257960	4260960	That you are sending it from on the other side.
4260960	4261960	Mm.
4261960	4262960	Wow.
4262960	4263960	You really write...
4263960	4264960	You write so magically.
4264960	4265960	Ha!
4265960	4266960	Ha!
4266960	4267960	Ha!
4267960	4268960	I want mail, but...
4268960	4269960	Sir...
4269960	4271960	Wa!
4271960	4272960	This is a...
4272960	4275960	This is a series of hash marks.
4275960	4277960	We're sorry.
4277960	4279960	Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
4279960	4280960	Hey.
4280960	4281960	Another one.
4281960	4282960	Okay.
4282960	4284960	Well, I'm glad to hear that you're...
4284960	4287960	You have standards for yourself.
4287960	4288960	All right.
4288960	4289960	Come on.
4289960	4293960	Well, now, what do you mean?
4293960	4294960	Continue to say...
4294960	4295960	Continue to say...
4295960	4296960	It's been...
4296960	4297960	Are we fucking doing this?
4297960	4298960	Are we fucking doing this?
4298960	4299960	Are we fucking doing this?
4299960	4300960	Are we fucking doing this?
4300960	4301960	Are we fucking doing this?
4301960	4304960	After all that fucking talking about...
4304960	4306960	I'm sorry.
4306960	4307960	I was...
4307960	4308960	I can't work like this.
4308960	4309960	You can't work like this.
4309960	4310960	Just fucking end the scene.
4310960	4311960	All right.
4311960	4312960	Come in.
4312960	4313960	It's a post office.
4313960	4324960	Honey, I thought you were going to be home after you mailed your box.
4324960	4326960	Oh.
4326960	4327960	Cheryl Teague.
4327960	4328960	Ha!
4328960	4329960	Ha!
4329960	4330960	Ha!
4330960	4331960	That's the end, because it's a sketch.
4331960	4334960	He's got a crazy character, and it's crazy that he's married to a sexy model lady.
4334960	4335960	Yeah.
4335960	4336960	My character...
4336960	4337960	The character was...
4338960	4347960	How much can I pay to get you a non-sound dog free sample of sounddog.com fucking audio files?
4347960	4353960	Like 12 KBPS fucking sound.
4353960	4358960	It sounds like my grandma is Skyping in the sound effects.
4358960	4359960	If you were...
4359960	4360960	Yeah.
4360960	4366960	That laugh, like, is, like, peace to get...
4366960	4367960	Do that laugh again.
4367960	4376960	Listen to the way they kind of trail off and lose interest in their own laughter.
4376960	4377960	Wait.
4377960	4378960	Okay.
4378960	4381960	They all went back to the punch press.
4381960	4385960	Shrobs, say something funny and then hit the button.
4386960	4389960	When do you know when you're finished?
4389960	4390960	Come on.
4390960	4391960	Press the...
4391960	4392960	Jesus Christ.
4392960	4393960	What the hell are you doing?
4393960	4394960	Which button?
4394960	4395960	I've got loads of buttons.
4395960	4396960	No.
4396960	4397960	Press the fucking laugh button.
4397960	4400960	Obviously the fucking laugh button.
4400960	4401960	Sorry.
4401960	4402960	Sorry.
4402960	4403960	Sorry.
4403960	4404960	Thank you.
4404960	4405960	We'll try it again.
4405960	4406960	We'll try it again.
4406960	4407960	We'll try it again.
4407960	4408960	We'll try it live.
4408960	4409960	All right.
4409960	4411960	Say something funnier.
4411960	4414960	I'm pimping me.
4414960	4418960	Well, I'll take it to you.
4418960	4419960	You guys...
4419960	4420960	I'll...
4420960	4422960	Based on these...
4422960	4427960	Spencer's in the middle of leading an experiment of some kind.
4427960	4428960	Okay.
4428960	4429960	Spencer, take over.
4429960	4430960	Okay.
4430960	4434960	I'm sticking with the laugh track button on this one.
4434960	4435960	Okay.
4435960	4440960	There was an explosion somewhere in New York, but people think it might have been a Samsung
4440960	4443960	Galaxy S8.
4444960	4451960	Again, I mean...
4451960	4466960	The president tweeted today that he wants the country to stop doing bad things.
4466960	4472960	When reached for comment, he was at Stormy Daniels House.
4472960	4478960	There's one guy in there that's just like...
4478960	4479960	That's crying.
4479960	4482960	Or is he slowly realizing that he's like...
4482960	4483960	He's booing, right?
4483960	4484960	There's one guy in there that he is booing.
4484960	4487960	That puts it to be a sound like someone going...
4496960	4497960	Or actually...
4497960	4498960	It might be a murder.
4498960	4499960	Is there a murder house?
4499960	4500960	A ghost or a zombie?
4500960	4504960	When you get your cheap sound effects, they're like, look, we can't...
4504960	4508960	It's the same as like, you get cheap tuna, there's going to be some dolphin in it.
4508960	4514960	It's like how in poltergeist they use real skeletons.
4514960	4518960	Yeah, the Pirates of the Caribbean had...
4518960	4520960	They got some UCLA skeletons for a while.
4520960	4522960	They were like, well, you know, we'll fix it later.
4522960	4527960	You know, they got away with it until they were caught selling arms to China.
4530960	4537960	Well, it's been 283 episodes to do that joke.
4537960	4541960	I mean, I really would like to outfit you for our sketch segments.
4541960	4542960	No, I've said that.
4542960	4544960	It's not a terrible idea.
4544960	4545960	It's the execution.
4545960	4549960	I want to say at hindsight, it's awful, but we're going to be here for a couple more weeks.
4549960	4553960	We're not going to be up and running in front of the audience, but this is a rare opportunity.
4553960	4562960	We're doing a single-camera podcast, and we could have some fun with this and wear it the fuck out.
4562960	4564960	Right, we could do video bits.
4564960	4573960	Well, not video bits, but I'm just saying audio bits, doing fake sketches, like our B sketch,
4573960	4577960	we could have somebody doing a little soundboard with the laughter.
4577960	4578960	I like that idea.
4578960	4580960	That's fun.
4581960	4584960	That's an atom bomb of an idea, Dan.
4584960	4585960	All right.
4585960	4588960	Well, come back.
4588960	4596960	You guys were talking about like cutting open people and cadavers and stuff like that earlier before I remember.
4596960	4601960	That reminded me of like in the Return of the Living Dead, like special features.
4601960	4606960	The production designer goes like, oh, I wonder if I can tell this.
4606960	4615960	So we went, you know, Dan O'Bannon and I, we went to several funeral homes in Southern California where we were shooting,
4615960	4620960	for research to see what they look like on the inside, the morgues and the funeral homes.
4620960	4629960	And every single time as we were leaving, somebody would run out to the parking lot and go, they're fucking them.
4629960	4630960	They're fucking them.
4630960	4632960	They're fucking the bodies every night.
4632960	4635960	Every night, they're fucking them.
4635960	4642960	So when you die, you go to the funeral home and somebody's probably fucking you.
4650960	4652960	I have necrophilia questions.
4652960	4653960	Okay.
4653960	4654960	Shoot.
4654960	4658960	And they're not based on shaming anyone because although...
4658960	4660960	Hold your head up high if you fuck dead people.
4660960	4666960	Necrophilia is a tricky area because the rule, the safe, easy rule is don't fuck dead things.
4666960	4669960	Don't kink shame people if your kink has no victim.
4669960	4670960	It's a tough area.
4670960	4674960	Necrophilia, a dead person has not consented.
4674960	4675960	They have loved ones.
4675960	4676960	I don't know.
4676960	4677960	Vandalism.
4677960	4679960	Well, also like though...
4679960	4681960	You're also trusting the person.
4681960	4687960	If you're fucking a corpse in a funeral home, I would, you know, that's unprofessional if nothing else.
4687960	4689960	We don't have to go into unethical.
4689960	4690960	We could just call it unprofessional.
4690960	4695960	It's like if I fucked the director's cut of Community in the edit bay.
4695960	4698960	It's like, well, I don't know if he's doing anything bad.
4698960	4700960	I just know that he should be working on the show.
4700960	4702960	Yeah, that's a good example.
4702960	4707960	So apart from that, so I'm not judging.
4707960	4712960	If you're listening and you have necrophilia-esque urges...
4712960	4713960	Stop it.
4713960	4715960	Look, I got mannequin legs in my home.
4716960	4722960	If you listen to the podcast, I have parasexual tendencies.
4722960	4724960	What does parasexual mean?
4724960	4728960	It's anything other than, you know, what it sounds like.
4728960	4729960	There's two of them.
4729960	4732960	You do it jumping out of an airplane behind enemy lines.
4732960	4736960	It's not like a pussy, but it's sexual to you.
4736960	4739960	Like a mannequin leg.
4739960	4740960	I don't know.
4740960	4742960	It's just like paranormal, anything.
4742960	4744960	A mannequin leg isn't a pussy.
4744960	4745960	You're a boob.
4745960	4746960	Exactly.
4746960	4747960	Like a foot isn't.
4747960	4751960	If you have a foot fetish, you're under the umbrella of paraphilic,
4751960	4753960	which when you start to...
4753960	4754960	It's like the end of Revenge of the Nerds.
4754960	4756960	Everyone who's a nerd come down here.
4756960	4758960	If you're a nerd for any tiny reason and you're all under one tent,
4758960	4759960	then everyone is.
4759960	4760960	We all...
4760960	4762960	What is normal sexuality?
4762960	4766960	That's what the Kinsey studies were, you know, the most useful.
4766960	4769960	It's like, look, we're all kinked like hair.
4769960	4773960	What follicle is perfectly circular?
4773960	4778960	So anyways, my question to people who are necrophiles,
4778960	4782960	or rather not my question to them, my question about necrophilia is,
4782960	4785960	how does that work?
4785960	4787960	Is it...
4787960	4790960	Aren't they...
4790960	4792960	They're cold and they're...
4792960	4799960	We tend to leap to, oh, they're putting their penis in a dead vagina.
4799960	4800960	Oh, yeah.
4800960	4804960	Which then we go, well, logistically that doesn't make any sense to me.
4804960	4805960	Right?
4805960	4806960	That doesn't make any sense.
4806960	4808960	But you masturbate with a mannequin leg, isn't that cold?
4808960	4809960	Right.
4809960	4810960	Well, that's what I'm saying.
4810960	4811960	Is necrophilia...
4811960	4814960	Is it necrophilia if you're working at a mortuary and you're like,
4814960	4818960	well, this person died very attractive.
4818960	4826960	Now their blood is pooling on the underside, but...
4826960	4829960	And their joints are kind of stiff, but you know, a foot's a foot.
4829960	4832960	And I'm going to rub my dick on the sole of the foot until I come.
4832960	4833960	Yeah, I think that counts.
4833960	4834960	Is that necrophilia?
4834960	4835960	Here's a question.
4835960	4837960	Can I ask a question to you?
4837960	4838960	Mm-hmm.
4838960	4839960	All right.
4839960	4843960	So I'm a mortician and I like to fuck dead people.
4843960	4844960	Okay.
4844960	4845960	So win-win right there.
4845960	4846960	Right.
4846960	4847960	Everybody's a winner.
4847960	4848960	Everybody's a winner.
4848960	4851960	Just like Den Master, Priest, all these other things.
4851960	4852960	Right, right, right.
4852960	4853960	Just follow the heat.
4853960	4854960	Right, exactly.
4854960	4855960	So...
4855960	4856960	Follow the money.
4856960	4858960	Somebody brings in...
4858960	4861960	When they bring in a dead body and I've decided,
4861960	4863960	I'm going to fuck this one today.
4863960	4864960	Okay.
4864960	4865960	You're seeing it when they bring it in.
4865960	4866960	You're like...
4866960	4867960	Yeah, I think I can deal with this.
4867960	4868960	From across the room.
4868960	4869960	Yeah.
4869960	4870960	Okay.
4870960	4871960	Yeah, perfect.
4871960	4872960	It's great.
4872960	4877960	But my job is really not to fuck the dead people.
4877960	4878960	The job is to...
4878960	4883960	Can you make this presentable for us?
4883960	4884960	The customer is saying that.
4884960	4886960	The customer is like, can you please take this
4886960	4889960	and make this look more sleeping than dead?
4889960	4890960	Right.
4890960	4891960	Like alive but...
4891960	4893960	Can you make our loved one look beautiful?
4893960	4894960	Yeah.
4894960	4895960	Can you do that?
4895960	4902960	So my question is, do they fuck it before or after?
4902960	4903960	Do they like go...
4903960	4905960	You have better necrophilia questions than I do.
4905960	4907960	Because I'm like, if it's all...
4907960	4909960	The blood pooling is what made me go,
4909960	4910960	yeah, you're right.
4910960	4913960	I say you do both and that way...
4913960	4914960	That's true.
4914960	4915960	It's like two different...
4915960	4916960	Oh, wow.
4916960	4921960	Grandma, you clean up nice and then you start...
4921960	4923960	Well, here's an important question.
4923960	4925960	Are these necrophilia questions...
4925960	4927960	When we're talking about mortuaries where there's
4927960	4932960	an influx of corpses, but exactly at the same time,
4932960	4937960	the whole point of that point of sale is to cheat death
4937960	4942960	in a way, to restore lividity to all these things.
4942960	4948960	If there's a problem as there is in forgive me Catholics,
4948960	4951960	you know, like where there be priests,
4951960	4954960	there be problems, we've found if there's like
4954960	4956960	nexus points of...
4956960	4959960	Is that properly necrophilia?
4959960	4961960	Do necrophiliacs...
4961960	4962960	I want to...
4962960	4964960	Because like...
4964960	4966960	How many necrophiliacs do you think there are?
4966960	4967960	Do you think it's a common...
4967960	4969960	Well, he's just telling an anecdote about how they
4969960	4970960	went to a bunch of funeral homes.
4971960	4973960	Three or four funeral homes in Southern California
4973960	4975960	and he would made it a point that it was like
4975960	4979960	every single one, some intern, some person...
4979960	4980960	A whistleblower.
4980960	4983960	Somebody would go, these guys are fucking the corpses.
4983960	4984960	For sure, they're fucking them.
4984960	4986960	So it's like that Westworld dude that is like
4986960	4988960	fucking all the robots.
4988960	4990960	But here's the thing, how...
4990960	4993960	I'm not forgiving that behavior,
4993960	4995960	I'm calling it unprofessional...
4995960	4997960	At the very least.
4997960	4999960	But I'm wondering though...
4999960	5001960	That's what I would say if I caught him in the act.
5001960	5004960	I want to understand what genuine necrophilia is
5004960	5006960	and if there's a distinction between that
5006960	5010960	and someone who, for instance, if I walk by...
5010960	5018960	If Jeffrey Dahmer, he was drilling holes in guys' heads
5018960	5022960	and experimenting with pouring water and acid
5022960	5027960	and stuff into the holes because he said to the police
5027960	5030960	that his dream was to create what he called a zombie.
5030960	5032960	And what I think he really meant by that,
5032960	5034960	I'm not a psychologist but...
5034960	5036960	It's like everybody gets to pile in on this
5036960	5038960	but I think the popular theory is that
5038960	5042960	what he really means by that is a man that won't judge him
5042960	5046960	for being gay, which he was,
5046960	5049960	but he didn't have a healthy relationship with his gayness
5049960	5054960	and he didn't realize that it's okay to go out
5054960	5056960	and get a drink and tell another dude
5056960	5058960	that what you really want to do is this or that.
5058960	5060960	He had a lot of shame and all this stuff.
5060960	5064960	It's like, did he really want to fuck corpses?
5064960	5067960	Is that what a necrophiliac really is?
5067960	5072960	Because I always wonder if there's an actual genuine necrophiliac,
5072960	5076960	if someone's like, I love rotting flesh.
5076960	5078960	I love dead people.
5078960	5083960	I'm turned on by the idea of a dead person.
5083960	5087960	Is that person offended by all these other yahoos
5087960	5091960	who are basically just like, yeah, I'm insecure.
5091960	5093960	I just don't want people judging me.
5093960	5095960	So I'm going to...
5095960	5103960	Yeah, like Dahmer hid out in a store
5103960	5106960	so he could abscond with a mannequin once.
5106960	5109960	He was taking these steps.
5109960	5112960	I think he came over to my apartment in Hollywood once
5112960	5115960	when I was starting to become aware of my fetishes and stuff
5115960	5118960	and he's like, what the fuck is going on?
5118960	5120960	Are you a serial killer?
5120960	5122960	Because I had fucking mannequin legs.
5122960	5124960	I wasn't allowed in your bedroom because there's stuff in there
5124960	5126960	that I don't want you to see.
5126960	5128960	The menagerie.
5128960	5134960	I was exploring stuff that had a lot to do with
5134960	5138960	the intersections between my self-awareness, my shame, and all this stuff.
5138960	5141960	I came out on the other side, a guy who could say on a podcast,
5141960	5144960	I know what I really want is for a woman wearing pantyhose
5144960	5146960	to rub her toe on my nipple.
5146960	5149960	Like, and Cody can be like, yeah, I like doing that too.
5149960	5152960	It strengthens my core and then we do other stuff.
5152960	5159960	It really had nothing to do with so much like...
5159960	5163960	That's my necrophilia question.
5163960	5166960	Is there such a thing as a person who's like,
5166960	5169960	I want the corpse to be stinky and bruised?
5169960	5170960	I'm sure there is.
5170960	5174960	There's somebody who's into anything.
5174960	5179960	There's people who want to roll around in blood and guts.
5179960	5186960	It's like you can find anything on the internet to jerk off to because of that.
5186960	5189960	Some people want to eat people.
5189960	5191960	Some people want to eat poop.
5191960	5193960	I listen to a lot of true crime podcasts with Cody.
5193960	5198960	We go to sleep on them and there's the Sunset Strip Killers.
5198960	5200960	I think that's what they're called.
5200960	5202960	There's this couple that were...
5202960	5205960	There's the guy indulging himself and the woman was kind of raised...
5205960	5208960	There's a lot of questions about it.
5208960	5211960	But she, according to her testimony,
5211960	5221960	he loved to pay people for sex and then kill them while they were performing sex on him
5221960	5225960	because his sex workers were a big target for him.
5225960	5228960	According to her, he would do shit.
5228960	5235960	He took a person's head into the shower with him and he fucked the head.
5235960	5240960	The cops said that they found semen in the decapitated head's throat.
5240960	5249960	But then the guy, they have him recorded and giving his deposition and stuff.
5249960	5253960	He's going like, what do you think I did?
5253960	5257960	I put a head in a freezer and I took a frozen head.
5257960	5259960	Have you ever heard of Rigor Mortis?
5259960	5265960	I'm going to take that in the shower and I'm going to put my dick in it.
5265960	5270960	He sounds like a completely rational person going like,
5270960	5273960	yeah, what do you mean I fucked a decapitated head?
5273960	5275960	That doesn't make any sense.
5275960	5277960	But he probably did.
5277960	5281960	But he has another lobe of his brain going like, that's crazy.
5281960	5283960	Why would that give you a hard on?
5283960	5287960	It's another thing to be able to achieve orgasm too.
5287960	5293960	Imagine being turned on that much by the idea that the head is dead.
5293960	5298960	Not the idea that the head is going to do whatever you want because it's no longer judging you.
5298960	5300960	I feel like that's a different...
5300960	5302960	Is it a power thing?
5302960	5306960	I think for a large amount of people under a larger umbrella,
5306960	5312960	it's a more mainstream thing to have fantasies about loss of control
5312960	5317960	and about controlling others because we carry a lot of shame into sex.
5317960	5323960	And so we naturally grow our sexual fantasies over across lines
5323960	5327960	where for outside circumstances in our taboo imagination,
5327960	5330960	I have permission to do this or I have to do that.
5330960	5334960	And that's where BDSM, it's almost at this point,
5334960	5340960	post-internet, we can acknowledge that there's mainstream,
5340960	5342960	which is almost a theoretical construct,
5342960	5344960	which is a man and woman getting into their pajamas at night
5344960	5347960	and laying next to each other and then a baby being brought by a stork.
5347960	5349960	And then there's everything kinky,
5349960	5354960	which involves people thinking about things that they know they're not supposed to think about
5354960	5362960	so that they can reach and scratch itches that they grow up thinking or deny them
5362960	5365960	when the truth is with a consenting adult, you could actually just say,
5365960	5370960	let's pretend this or let's have you do that and my safe word is apples.
5370960	5377960	But so I guess my fascination and my question is,
5377960	5382960	but then that means, I think, that people who feel free to meet someone and say,
5382960	5384960	let's kill a hooker together.
5384960	5386960	These people aren't ashamed.
5386960	5389960	They're not living with all this shame.
5389960	5393960	So then when it's reported that they fucked the head
5393960	5398960	or they always killed the person and then sodomized the corpse,
5398960	5403960	these are people who actually can't wait for the dead part to happen.
5403960	5404960	Right.
5404960	5407960	So the answer would be, to go back to my original question,
5407960	5413960	is that person would fuck the gunshot wound person without sewing up the holes.
5413960	5414960	Right.
5414960	5418960	They would get done and they'd go, well, I'm going to clean it off anyway.
5418960	5419960	I mean, that's the thing.
5419960	5422960	It's like you're cleaning it off twice if you're...
5422960	5424960	But then there's a different kind of person.
5424960	5425960	And I'm sorry if this...
5425960	5426960	I don't know who I'm apologizing to.
5426960	5429960	They'll be like, I didn't subscribe to this podcast.
5429960	5431960	I don't know who that person is, but...
5431960	5433960	My family listened to this podcast.
5433960	5437960	But it is kind of fascinating then to think about the two.
5437960	5441960	You could do a sitcom and a mortuary and there's the guy who's like,
5441960	5447960	well, man, I could barely contain myself before we make him look alive again.
5447960	5450960	And then the other person is like, oh, now that we added all that rouge,
5450960	5451960	I'm like...
5451960	5452960	I know, now.
5452960	5453960	Yeah.
5453960	5454960	Okay.
5454960	5456960	You watch the door.
5456960	5457960	I don't think these guys...
5457960	5458960	You watch the door this time.
5458960	5459960	I think these guys both...
5459960	5460960	I watched the door last time.
5460960	5461960	You watched...
5461960	5462960	I don't know.
5462960	5465960	If those guys cooperate, it's like a fucking most dangerous thing in the world.
5465960	5469960	I think they both go home to their wives and go, I think Ted's a pervert.
5469960	5471960	I think this is how it is.
5471960	5472960	Okay, so there's...
5472960	5476960	The old guy and the new guy comes in and the old guy teaches them,
5476960	5477960	hey, you know?
5477960	5478960	Hey.
5478960	5479960	Yeah.
5479960	5480960	You know?
5480960	5481960	Go for it.
5481960	5482960	No cop, no stop, man.
5482960	5483960	Go for it.
5483960	5484960	You know?
5484960	5485960	What are you talking about?
5485960	5486960	I see you.
5486960	5488960	I see you checking them out.
5488960	5492960	If we lived in an idealized society, there would be like a good classic
5492960	5495960	karate kid kind of movie where it's like...
5495960	5499960	But I think it would be like a student becomes a teacher thing where the...
5499960	5500960	Or no, okay.
5500960	5504960	The classic version would be like, the new guy comes in and he's like,
5504960	5508960	yeah, come on, let's put some embalming fluid in these things
5508960	5514960	and let's get them dressed up and looking alive.
5514960	5518960	Because the truth is, I got to tell you, now that we're having a drink in the back room,
5518960	5520960	I want to fuck a corpse.
5520960	5523960	And the mentor goes like, you want to fuck a corpse?
5523960	5524960	No, you don't.
5524960	5526960	Listen to yourself.
5526960	5528960	You can't wait until it's pretty.
5528960	5531960	You can't wait until its eyes are closed instead of popped open,
5531960	5533960	staring into the dead air.
5533960	5536960	You hate the bruising.
5536960	5542960	If you were a real necrophile, brother, you'd be at the indoor with your heart on out.
5542960	5545960	It's in the way that you use it.
5545960	5549960	And it's like he learns to be a purist.
5549960	5552960	Okay.
5552960	5554960	Write it.
5558960	5560960	Yeah, necrophiliacs.
5560960	5563960	It's just brought to you by Reebok.
5563960	5565960	It soon will be.
5565960	5570960	Well, I guess, okay, so I'm the only one that has these necrophilia questions.
5570960	5572960	I'd never really give it any thought.
5572960	5579960	I mean, I think there's probably people that death is a turn on because of their shame
5579960	5583960	and because of the feeling of lack of judgment.
5583960	5586960	And then there's also people that I think are just so fucked up that there's something about...
5586960	5588960	It's so naughty. It's so forbidden.
5588960	5596960	It's so fucking crazy that I'm the Johnny Rotten of sex.
5596960	5606960	It's like misanthropic because when you get to the point where it's no longer a person,
5606960	5610960	that's why it turns you on is that it's rotting flesh.
5610960	5615960	That person is so fucked up, not to...
5615960	5622960	I mean, whatever, but that person has gone so far past the threshold.
5622960	5627960	They hate humanity itself to the point where they love death.
5627960	5629960	They're a necrophile.
5629960	5632960	I want to fuck a corpse because it's dead.
5632960	5639960	So if you were from, like I say, a small town and you were a mortician,
5639960	5645960	it would be a good chance that you would know a lot of the people that would come through.
5645960	5647960	Right.
5647960	5649960	That's the ticket.
5649960	5651960	Why is that the ticket?
5651960	5655960	Because then you can go, eat us.
5655960	5657960	Wait, but you don't want to put...
5657960	5660960	Well, yeah, because the Johnny Rotten thing, it's vandalism.
5660960	5666960	You're like, oh, I remember Gladys from the diner and now she's dead and that makes my difference.
5666960	5673960	Yeah, I mean, like if you were into that, maybe there's a different thrill and maybe there's a motivation to work in a small town.
5673960	5677960	I don't know.
5677960	5683960	Dahmer went to, was at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
5683960	5684960	Did he? Wait, no, he didn't.
5684960	5694960	He didn't go to it, but when I went back for my talk that I did there, my old sculpture teacher, Bruce,
5694960	5706960	says, like a week before he was busted, he was at the MyAd, like, not gift shop, but like supply store looking at the...
5706960	5714960	I don't know if you remember this, but back in the early 90s there was this thing called spray fix or whatever, or stone fleck,
5714960	5718960	and it was like a can of spray paint, but it wasn't paint.
5718960	5726960	It would just like make it look like your block of wood was made out of marble or stone or concrete or whatever.
5726960	5728960	And he was looking for flesh.
5728960	5741960	Well, no, here's the thing is like, you know, like the joke was in sculpture class that there would be like, like out of 10 people there would be nine stone fleck, like shoes,
5741960	5746960	like it was just like instant art, whatever, but Dahmer was checking out.
5746960	5748960	That's where he bought the stone fleck.
5748960	5756960	If you look into it, I think he sprayed like some skulls with this stuff, but my teacher like talked to him for a second.
5756960	5758960	He's like, yeah, you're kind of a weirdo.
5758960	5759960	Why is this guy here?
5759960	5762960	And then like a week later, Dahmer got busted.
5762960	5763960	Wow.
5763960	5765960	And I was like, oh.
5765960	5773960	I said like the true crime, my true crime podcast addiction is like obviously every every every podcast is going to eventually touch on Dahmer.
5773960	5779960	And I thought I was a bit of a Dahmer expert compared to the rest of the country because we're from Milwaukee when he was doing it.
5779960	5783960	And boy, oh boy, it's just you missed out.
5783960	5786960	Well, it's it's paying attention to the war.
5786960	5790960	The police scandal thing is just fucking like what do you mean?
5790960	5791960	Like what do you mean?
5791960	5802960	Well, you know how you know if most people that have heard of Dahmer know the fact that that the cops brought victim number.
5802960	5812960	I'm going to make up a number like 14 of 17 or something like that, like was brought back to his apartment because he escaped.
5812960	5817960	And it was just like this like Dahmer showed up.
5817960	5824960	He would with his bag of liquor that he went to go by while he chained this guy to a bed who escaped.
5824960	5827960	It was like the cops brought him back to Dahmer's apartment.
5827960	5830960	And because Dahmer said, oh, we're just look, we're lovers.
5830960	5838960	And yeah, I know he looks underage and he's bleeding and he's delirious and he has handcuffs on his wrist.
5838960	5843960	We're just gay like that. And the cops like handed him over and he killed him immediately.
5843960	5844960	Well, of course he did.
5844960	5848960	But then also he killed more people after that. Right.
5848960	5851960	And and the like I knew about all that.
5851960	5854960	And I was like, OK, shame of a city and blah, blah, blah.
5854960	5863960	But what I didn't know is that those cops were something like even lighter than suspended without pay.
5863960	5866960	It was like they still got paid.
5866960	5878960	And they and one of them ended up like captain of like it was like it's like you hear the shit and then you go like, well, I'm sure you know it's important to be shameful and all this stuff.
5878960	5886960	But it's like it's like for real like it just like it just they like there was no punishment.
5886960	5890960	There was no nothing happened to those two cops.
5890960	5898960	And it's like because it doesn't your instinct, your human empathic instinct, like, well, I'd hate to be those two cops because they didn't know they were thrust into the midst of this thing.
5898960	5900960	And who knows what it's like to be a cop and all this stuff.
5900960	5913960	And you extend all this empathy and then you and then you realize that you're dealing with a system that does not extend even the slightest bit of that empathy by saying like, well, maybe you should fucking even if for symbolic purposes, never be a fucking cop again.
5913960	5921960	Ever like ever within the hundred mile radius of the people whose families were eaten by this guy.
5921960	5924960	I'd like like like like go to Detroit.
5924960	5928960	I don't know what let's figure something out of the Vatican can come up with a system we can.
5928960	5932960	But they're just like it was like I can't believe.
5932960	5942960	Can you imagine being like living in that neighborhood, which was, you know, on Marquette's campus where I went to school.
5942960	5945960	Anyways, it's just it's fucking insane.
5945960	5947960	Whatever.
5947960	5948960	What were you talking about?
5948960	5950960	Annihilation is.
5950960	5951960	Annihilation.
5951960	5952960	What were your question?
5952960	5953960	What's annihilation about?
5953960	5954960	Is it? Oh, what?
5954960	5956960	I think I answered all my I didn't know.
5956960	5957960	He had a nice question.
5957960	5960960	Oh, you didn't answer most of your necrophilia questions, right?
5960960	5962960	I thought we did at least.
5962960	5964960	Um, it's a pretty heavy movie.
5964960	5966960	So heavy.
5966960	5971960	Yeah, I mean, it was it just I mean, like, looking.
5971960	5980960	I watched the movie and it's very like I kind of I can't it would have been a better movie if it was made like say in the 70s or maybe even the 90s.
5980960	5994960	But it's like it because it was like about like this meteor that crashed on Earth or something like that is a zone, a weird zone, a zone crashed on Earth or something appeared on Earth.
5994960	5995960	A what?
5995960	5996960	A zone appeared on Earth.
5996960	5998960	A zone appeared on Earth.
5998960	6001960	And where it is, things were a little different.
6001960	6017960	And then and then like the prism effect not only reflected reflected lighter, refracted light, but it also refracted feelings, feelings and DNA and stuff like that.
6017960	6019960	And it got kind of weird.
6019960	6020960	It's a weird pacing thing.
6020960	6023960	But, um, yeah, I don't know.
6023960	6026960	If you haven't seen it, I can't we can't really talk about it.
6026960	6027960	I can't wait to check it out.
6027960	6029960	Are there corpses in it?
6029960	6030960	Oh, there's a corpse.
6030960	6033960	But there's a bit of surprise with it.
6033960	6035960	Are they are they hot corpses?
6035960	6037960	Oh, one of them is.
6037960	6039960	But that, you know, a bit more than that.
6039960	6043960	Spoilers, I think one of it's really right.
6043960	6044960	And a bit more.
6044960	6047960	Should we these and these and shambles and mounds or is it enough time?
6047960	6048960	It's court.
6048960	6049960	We don't do that.
6049960	6051960	Is that enough time?
6051960	6054960	I mean, I'm so high still.
6054960	6056960	Well, could I get high and then we'll do it?
6056960	6058960	No.
6058960	6059960	That's sarcastic.
6059960	6060960	Yes.
6060960	6062960	Are you allowed to get high like on camera?
6062960	6063960	No, we can't.
6063960	6064960	We'll get arrested.
6064960	6065960	That's not true at all.
6065960	6067960	It's true.
6067960	6068960	No, I can say it's tobacco.
6068960	6069960	What if it's not?
6069960	6073960	What if we say it's fake pot that we bought?
6073960	6076960	What if can Rob get arrested for saying that he's high?
6076960	6077960	Can he get arrested?
6077960	6078960	Yeah.
6078960	6079960	And he can take me man.
6079960	6080960	Sure.
6080960	6081960	You're at my house.
6081960	6084960	I got to say with a beard from this angle, like from a certain angle.
6084960	6086960	It's a little Brody Stevens going on here.
6086960	6088960	Oh, a lot of Brody Stevens going on.
6088960	6090960	I would say don't think it high end.
6090960	6091960	You don't even know.
6091960	6093960	I can't tell you what your point ever is.
6093960	6095960	Like you just dry and dry and dry and dry.
6095960	6097960	Sometimes you're saying the opposite of what's true.
6097960	6099960	And sometimes you're saying exactly what's true.
6099960	6100960	What can you like?
6100960	6104960	Like what do you know about getting high on camera on podcasts, et cetera?
6104960	6107960	Say the truth.
6107960	6111960	It's, um, I don't, I don't know.
6111960	6116960	Like getting Doug with high, everybody gets high at the show,
6116960	6118960	but they don't live stream it.
6118960	6119960	Right.
6119960	6121960	I feel like I did two versions of getting Doug with high,
6121960	6125960	one where we were on like, there wasn't an audience.
6125960	6126960	Yeah.
6126960	6129960	And I, we smoked pot on camera.
6129960	6132960	I get high just making eye contact with Doug Benson.
6132960	6134960	And that's illegal.
6134960	6135960	It's hard to make eye contact with,
6135960	6138960	but one of the signs is just looking at weed.
6138960	6144960	Do you think like Dan Spencer and I look like Spencer is slowly turning into me
6144960	6146960	if like an evolutionary chart.
6146960	6148960	If I took off my hat.
6148960	6150960	No.
6150960	6152960	Cause the glasses are getting darker.
6152960	6154960	I went to the Adderall doctor and I,
6154960	6157960	and I was like looking forward to it for two months because I've been fucking
6157960	6161960	heavily working out and seven pounds.
6161960	6162960	Nice work.
6162960	6167960	When I was like, I had a number in my head that was a little higher than that.
6167960	6168960	Yeah.
6168960	6169960	I was a little disappointed.
6169960	6173960	I never thought I'd hear you lost seven pounds and be like bummed out.
6173960	6175960	That's, that's what, I don't know.
6175960	6176960	When I started weighing myself,
6176960	6179960	that was the thing I had to break the most is just because it's like every
6179960	6180960	time you get on,
6180960	6184960	you have something in your head and you're going to be disappointed every time.
6184960	6185960	That's why I don't weigh myself,
6185960	6188960	but I did think it was safe to fucking two months.
6188960	6189960	Right. Exactly.
6189960	6190960	And that's what will always happen.
6190960	6192960	It'll always be the worst.
6192960	6194960	So I'm never getting on a scale again.
6194960	6195960	You got to do the opposite.
6195960	6198960	You got to only get on the scale until your nerves go dumb.
6198960	6200960	I mean, numb.
6200960	6202960	You said, you said, yeah, you can,
6202960	6205960	you only take the lowest and highest or whatever.
6205960	6206960	I do different.
6206960	6207960	I mean, when I think of my weight,
6207960	6209960	I think of the last time I weighed myself,
6209960	6212960	but when I think about how far I've come from the fact that I used to be 270
6212960	6213960	pounds,
6213960	6215960	I go with the lowest because it's like,
6215960	6217960	holy shit, I lost 57 pounds.
6217960	6220960	How do you get rid of the fat in your tits?
6220960	6221960	Wait.
6221960	6223960	Why does it sit there forever?
6223960	6225960	Well, if you come over to my place tonight,
6225960	6226960	I'll show you.
6227960	6230960	Show me how to get rid of it or why it sits there?
6230960	6231960	Both.
6232960	6233960	I'll show you why.
6233960	6234960	I'll show you why.
6234960	6235960	Are you to suck on?
6235960	6236960	I know.
6236960	6238960	I titty fuck you.
6238960	6241960	There's the patent to Jeff B. Davis titty fuck workout.
6241960	6242960	Right.
6242960	6243960	Right.
6243960	6244960	I just fuck your man titties.
6244960	6245960	And it really...
6245960	6246960	And you lose weight?
6246960	6248960	No, your titties lose weight, too.
6248960	6250960	My titties lose weight, but you fucking...
6250960	6251960	Yes.
6251960	6252960	I've heard this before.
6252960	6254960	It's about moving the fascia around the skin.
6254960	6257960	It's called the dick and ball titty massage,
6257960	6258960	where I get right in there.
6258960	6259960	This is a scam.
6259960	6260960	And I titty fuck you.
6260960	6263960	And do you remember the old vibrating belt things?
6263960	6264960	Yeah.
6264960	6265960	It worked in the same principle as that.
6265960	6267960	And then he releases the magic medicine.
6267960	6271960	It's moving that adipose fat tissue.
6271960	6273960	Did those belt things work?
6273960	6274960	No.
6274960	6275960	No.
6275960	6276960	They did not work.
6276960	6280960	Which is why I'm here to tell everybody about Jeff B. Davis
6280960	6283960	patented titty fuck lose.
6283960	6289960	You'll lose your man titties in three nights.
6289960	6290960	You'll lose your man titties.
6290960	6291960	Or four.
6291960	6293960	But you got to really relax.
6293960	6294960	Wow.
6294960	6295960	As a person who loves...
6295960	6298960	You have to really, really just let it wash over you.
6298960	6300960	And I really mean that.
6300960	6301960	Yeah.
6301960	6306960	As a person who loves, as I assume you do, fucking men's titties.
6306960	6307960	No.
6307960	6308960	I do not do this because I enjoy this.
6308960	6309960	Oh, you don't love it.
6309960	6310960	I'm a medical...
6310960	6312960	I'm a man of science.
6312960	6313960	So you want them to go away.
6313960	6314960	What?
6314960	6315960	Yeah.
6315960	6316960	I mean, I'm a healthcare provider.
6316960	6317960	I want people to...
6317960	6318960	Like, if you come to me and say,
6318960	6325960	I can't get rid of these testosterone-y soy boy fucking estrogen-y man titties.
6325960	6326960	Right.
6326960	6328960	And I was like, look, I have the cure for you,
6328960	6331960	but this is not going to be the most...
6331960	6332960	Masculine.
6332960	6333960	It's not going to be the most...
6333960	6336960	You might not like these three nights, but it's about results.
6336960	6341960	And that's what I bring to the table, is results.
6341960	6342960	Results.
6342960	6343960	Results.
6343960	6345960	Always be results.
6345960	6346960	ABR.
6346960	6348960	I mean, I'm not going to like it any more than you, Old man.
6348960	6350960	Do you promise that they'll be gone, my titties?
6350960	6351960	Or are you...
6351960	6354960	That's absolutely a guarantee.
6354960	6355960	Three nights.
6355960	6356960	Take your shirt off right now.
6356960	6357960	Let's do it before...
6358960	6359960	We're going to come back.
6360960	6362960	The important thing to look at is right here.
6362960	6363960	This is the thing that bums me out.
6363960	6365960	I would be fine with my body the way it is right now.
6365960	6366960	That's the hard-off part.
6366960	6367960	I just don't like this...
6367960	6370960	Because if you were to draw me,
6370960	6374960	I don't mind if I have a belly as long as there's a smooth curve.
6374960	6376960	I don't like this...
6376960	6381960	I don't like a lump that you would have to do an extra pen stroke.
6381960	6382960	You get that sucked out.
6382960	6384960	That's what makes me...
6384960	6386960	Sympathize when people get lightbulbs.
6386960	6387960	Just get it out of there.
6387960	6389960	That's what we call a lateral flange.
6389960	6391960	That's done in night two.
6391960	6392960	A lateral flange.
6392960	6394960	That's done on night two.
6394960	6395960	Night two.
6395960	6399960	You're going to find your lateral flange gone by two nights,
6399960	6401960	and then the third night is just simply toning.
6401960	6402960	Toning?
6402960	6403960	Yes.
6403960	6405960	It's all about shape, tone.
6405960	6407960	We're going to get it just like you want.
6407960	6409960	Most of the results come from the third night.
6409960	6412960	Do you push them together?
6413960	6415960	Titty fucking, man.
6415960	6416960	What are you doing?
6416960	6420960	He's a lot of the things that he's describing are different things.
6420960	6423960	What planet do you titty fuck on?
6423960	6426960	I think I maybe tried titty fucking in my 20s.
6426960	6428960	You try everything because you see it in the movies,
6428960	6429960	and I'm like, okay.
6429960	6430960	After a while, you're like, okay.
6430960	6432960	You got to push them together, man.
6432960	6433960	I think of the movies as different.
6433960	6435960	How can you fucking do it wrong, man?
6435960	6436960	How can you fucking do it wrong?
6436960	6438960	How do you fucking do it?
6438960	6439960	There's a lot of different approaches.
6439960	6441960	I take it on a titty by titty basis.
6445960	6447960	Do you change your technique on the second night?
6447960	6449960	Well, I mean, let's go away.
6449960	6450960	I don't understand.
6450960	6451960	Your dick is rubbing me.
6451960	6454960	Human physiognomy is always very different from person to person.
6454960	6456960	I love human physiognomy.
6456960	6458960	The first night, I fuck one titty individually.
6458960	6459960	I alternate.
6459960	6461960	I fuck just individual titties.
6461960	6462960	I don't do just...
6462960	6464960	Oh, you don't put it in between like a hot dog.
6464960	6465960	He puts it into it.
6465960	6467960	Night two, lateral flanger.
6467960	6469960	How do you titty fuck, man?
6469960	6471960	You got to push them together.
6471960	6472960	You got to push them together.
6472960	6474960	These are closely guarded trade secrets.
6474960	6475960	Okay, okay.
6475960	6476960	I understand.
6476960	6477960	Hey, man.
6477960	6479960	How do you titty fuck, man?
6479960	6483960	You got to push them together, man.
6483960	6484960	But we have...
6484960	6487960	We're going to post the before photo.
6487960	6489960	We're going to come back on next Sunday,
6489960	6491960	and we're going to see different results.
6491960	6493960	Well, you got to push them together, man.
6493960	6494960	It's titty fuck.
6494960	6495960	Come on.
6495960	6496960	It's the new character.
6496960	6498960	Yeah, pushing...
6498960	6500960	He's so irritated.
6500960	6503960	He's so mad at the world for not titty fucking right.
6503960	6505960	It's what he's doing, man.
6505960	6506960	You got to push them together.
6506960	6508960	In his defense, you got to push them together.
6508960	6511960	I don't even like that I have to call it titty fucking.
6511960	6515960	I like to call it titty flanger movement.
6515960	6521960	But I think the way that the world's eyes into my special technique
6521960	6525960	is that people are going to associate me putting my dick on your tits
6525960	6527960	and it's just the simplest way to do it.
6527960	6528960	The haters.
6528960	6530960	Yeah, the haters are going to call it that anyway.
6530960	6532960	So why not get out in front of them?
6532960	6534960	Do you finish?
6534960	6535960	Do I?
6535960	6536960	Does he finish?
6536960	6537960	Church...
6537960	6538960	See, that's a great question.
6538960	6539960	Important question.
6539960	6544960	If you go to tittyfinesremoval.org, .med...
6544960	6546960	.med?
6546960	6550960	On my FAQ, first question, do I finish?
6550960	6551960	Right.
6551960	6552960	No.
6552960	6557960	Unless the finishing is, do I finish giving you the results that you want
6557960	6559960	out of your man titties?
6559960	6561960	Sometimes I do come all over your neck.
6561960	6562960	But that's...
6562960	6563960	Okay.
6563960	6566960	But that's only when that's what the customer wants.
6566960	6567960	Again, this is about...
6567960	6573960	It's a two-way street of commitment.
6573960	6574960	Am I zealous?
6574960	6575960	Yes.
6575960	6577960	Is there...
6577960	6582960	You know, it's a vigorous three-day process.
6582960	6584960	And it happens at night.
6584960	6586960	It happens at my place.
6586960	6590960	And we have the before photo.
6590960	6597960	And if you don't see results on Dan's titties as of next Sunday,
6597960	6599960	Dan's money back.
6599960	6601960	Or I didn't go.
6601960	6602960	Or I didn't go.
6602960	6606960	Well, if you don't go, then we're not posting the after photos.
6606960	6607960	Right.
6607960	6611960	See, again, second question on the Jeff B. Davis tittyfinesremoval
6611960	6616960	technique system is how many people chicken out?
6616960	6617960	It's like...
6617960	6621960	They say when you go skydiving, the scariest part of skydiving is making
6621960	6623960	the reservation to go skydiving.
6623960	6625960	Jumping out of the plane is the easiest part.
6625960	6631960	It's can I, Dan Harmon, commit to a three-day system to get the results
6631960	6632960	that you want.
6632960	6633960	I paid 500 bucks for this.
6633960	6636960	If I don't jump out of this plane or let my friend come on my chest.
6636960	6637960	Yeah.
6637960	6640960	Harmontown listeners, especially for subscribers, if you subscribe
6640960	6644960	this month to Harmontown, I'm going to give you the first night free.
6644960	6647960	That's a $200 discount.
6647960	6651960	$400 for a three-day system, normally $600.
6651960	6652960	That's a $200 discount.
6652960	6655960	Dan, I'm going to give you yours for free because I want to get this,
6655960	6658960	you know, I want to get this system out there.
6658960	6659960	All right.
6659960	6663960	Well, we don't know what the state laws are or when they become federal
6663960	6667960	when we go with the podcast, but apparently I can't get high.
6667960	6668960	Right.
6668960	6672960	But Jeff can promise you that he'll rub his cock on your tits.
6672960	6673960	Right, or your money back.
6673960	6676960	Mayor may not come on you, but then again, that's completely secondary.
6676960	6678960	But only if you give him $200.
6678960	6681960	No, $400, it's normally $600.
6681960	6684960	I'm giving subscribers to Harmontown a $200 discount.
6684960	6685960	The first night is free.
6685960	6687960	If you use code...
6687960	6688960	Code.
6688960	6690960	Code titty fuck.
6690960	6691960	Right.
6691960	6692960	24.
6692960	6693960	Again, taking it back.
6693960	6694960	Is it childish?
6694960	6695960	Of course it is, but let's...
6695960	6696960	That's what people are going to say.
6696960	6697960	It's like the Soylent guy.
6697960	6698960	That's what people are going to say.
6698960	6699960	Yeah.
6699960	6700960	Just call it that.
6700960	6701960	Just like the Soylent guy.
6701960	6703960	Get out in front of the critics.
6703960	6706960	Also, my dick is made of micromodal fiber.
6706960	6708960	It's three times softer than cotton.
6708960	6711960	Do you think that's what Nigel ate or do you think I just cut him open
6711960	6712960	every six weeks?
6712960	6714960	Yeah, that's the question.
6714960	6717960	Did he just eat enough of your butt holes out of your underwear
6717960	6718960	to die?
6718960	6720960	I don't fucking know, man.
6720960	6725960	What if it's just a bunch of little swatches of me and these micromodal fiber
6725960	6727960	just came out of your dog's butt?
6727960	6728960	Have you ever...
6728960	6729960	You know, you hear people go like,
6729960	6733960	well, if I could take...
6733960	6736960	I would green mile my dog's stomach wound
6736960	6738960	because I'd be like, you know what?
6738960	6739960	That one's on me for sure.
6739960	6741960	I would do it too.
6741960	6742960	I would green mile that shit.
6742960	6746960	I would be like, okay, put a slit in my stomach
6746960	6749960	and I'll lay in bed and feel bad
6749960	6751960	because it's not even that noble a sacrifice
6751960	6753960	because I have the capability of saying,
6753960	6756960	Cody, can you get me a LaCroix?
6756960	6757960	Nigel can't be...
6757960	6761960	He doesn't know why we do anything we do.
6761960	6764960	You scoop him up because you love him and he's shivering
6764960	6765960	and he's like, why am I hurting?
6765960	6767960	And then you take him to a place.
6767960	6770960	Then you leave him.
6770960	6772960	The worst.
6772960	6776960	And their brain is the size of a fucking, like,
6776960	6778960	four-sided die.
6778960	6781960	Oh, I know what that is
6781960	6785960	because it's like a thing that I relate to.
6785960	6786960	All right, well, apparently...
6786960	6788960	We got two minutes to play D&D.
6788960	6790960	Spencer's the only one that's allowed
6790960	6791960	to be start craving high on stage.
6791960	6792960	I'm not...
6792960	6793960	What?
6793960	6795960	He's afraid that if we all get high,
6795960	6797960	he'll be out of a job.
6797960	6800960	His job is to be this high.
6800960	6803960	Did you check out this week's Atlanta?
6803960	6804960	No, I haven't seen it.
6804960	6806960	There was a Slender Man thing or...
6806960	6808960	No, no, no. I never said that.
6808960	6810960	Well, I saw, like, a still...
6810960	6812960	There's a big Slender Man arc this season.
6812960	6813960	No, no, no.
6813960	6815960	I guess I completed two things.
6815960	6817960	There's a Slender Man movie coming out.
6817960	6819960	Oh, Slender Man.
6819960	6820960	I thought I said, like, a still...
6820960	6822960	I swear to God, I'm not even doing a bit.
6822960	6825960	Like, I thought it was, like, an Atlanta episode.
6825960	6827960	This is how much of, like, me not watching Atlanta.
6827960	6830960	I'm also starting to enjoy this Atlanta in my head.
6830960	6832960	Like, oh, there's a Slender Man episode.
6832960	6833960	There is, yes.
6833960	6835960	Slender Man gives him a sandwich.
6835960	6837960	It's a fucking great episode.
6837960	6838960	You should watch it.
6838960	6839960	You gotta watch it, Dave.
6839960	6841960	Do I have to watch from the beginning of the first season?
6841960	6842960	No, no, no. It's a good...
6842960	6844960	I mean, honestly, I mean, I haven't...
6844960	6845960	That's the first episode I watched.
6845960	6846960	I loved it.
6846960	6847960	It's pretty slice-a-laffy.
6847960	6849960	Steven Soderbergh even said, like,
6849960	6851960	this is, like, the best...
6851960	6853960	Did Donald direct the song?
6853960	6855960	I think he wrote it, but it's...
6855960	6857960	He works with the director.
6857960	6860960	I think you should check it out, because he's amazing.
6860960	6861960	It's fun.
6861960	6865960	It's just, you know, it's not the kind of television you would...
6865960	6867960	that has existed in the past, you know?
6867960	6870960	It's just interesting to see what the medium can be.
6870960	6874960	You know, it could be a cartoon, and it could be Atlanta.
6874960	6877960	It's cool.
6877960	6878960	He's not gonna watch it.
6878960	6881960	You know that the photo that Church took of you at the protests,
6881960	6883960	of you wearing the Rick and Morty thing, drinking a flask?
6883960	6884960	Mm-hmm.
6884960	6886960	Just, I posted it on my Instagram.
6886960	6888960	She's already sold a couple prints.
6888960	6889960	People want that print.
6889960	6892960	She's making a limited 10-print run of those,
6892960	6893960	and people are snapping them up.
6893960	6894960	Snapping them up?
6894960	6895960	Yeah, it's...
6895960	6897960	That's a good photo.
6897960	6898960	I like that it says...
6898960	6901960	I'm wearing my Help Me Morty in Summer t-shirt,
6901960	6903960	but it just says, Help Me.
6903960	6905960	In the shot.
6905960	6907960	All right, well, what a show.
6907960	6908960	What a show.
6908960	6909960	What a show.
6909960	6912960	We really got through to some stuff.
6913960	6915960	I'm interested to play this one back and understand,
6915960	6918960	like, what line did I cross in asking my necrophilia questions
6918960	6919960	that made everybody...
6919960	6923960	You crossed a line where you chose to not offend necrophiles?
6923960	6924960	Oh.
6924960	6926960	Well, yeah, because I don't...
6926960	6928960	But look, I've gone to bat for pedophiles on this show.
6928960	6932960	I fucking hate, like, I hate victimization,
6932960	6936960	so people that victimize other people for their own pleasure,
6936960	6939960	like, okay, they're doing something that is criminally wrong,
6939960	6943960	like, so isn't that enough?
6943960	6945960	Are we gonna solve the problem
6945960	6947960	by just being so happy that we found monsters?
6947960	6951960	I find it really fucking weird, but not weird.
6951960	6954960	It's totally understandable that what we go like,
6954960	6956960	oh, what gives you a hard-on?
6956960	6957960	What? Ladybugs?
6957960	6959960	You're fucking crazy.
6959960	6961960	And it's like, we're all that person,
6961960	6963960	like, in some specific way.
6963960	6964960	I don't fuck ladybugs.
6964960	6966960	We're all that person.
6966960	6968960	And then we just, like, are we really...
6968960	6970960	That's exactly what they do in prison,
6970960	6972960	is they're all in there for fucked-up shit,
6972960	6974960	and then they get so fucking excited
6974960	6976960	when they hear a fucking pedophile in prison
6976960	6978960	that they run down to fuck the person to death or whatever.
6978960	6981960	Like, it's bullshit. Come on.
6981960	6984960	Like, criminality is criminality.
6984960	6986960	Like, some people are sick.
6986960	6988960	Some people are experiencing cycles of abuse.
6988960	6990960	Like, people that are abused in their childhood,
6990960	6992960	they grow up to abuse people.
6992960	6994960	Guess how you solve this problem, you know?
6994960	6997960	It's not through being so excited
6997960	6999960	as someone alien and monster that you, like,
6999960	7001960	point your finger at them and throw mud at them.
7001960	7003960	It's not gonna change anything.
7003960	7006960	Cliffhanger!
7006960	7008960	Thank you so much for coming or watching,
7008960	7010960	or you didn't even come.
7010960	7012960	You're just watching or listening to it.
7012960	7014960	Thank you so much, everybody, for coming down.
7014960	7016960	It's here for Rob Schraub, everybody.
7019960	7022960	And when you find out whatever file I have,
7022960	7025960	just remember how I went to bat for you.
7025960	7028960	Yeah, we're sorry to all the necrophiles that anyone was offended.
7028960	7030960	Sorry we didn't get to bring church up and leave you tonight,
7030960	7032960	but they will be back in parts.
7032960	7035960	Also, let's thank Kevin, Chris, Zach, Farrah,
7035960	7039960	you saw Spencer fit in.
7039960	7041960	That's all the time. I'm your cop trouble.
7041960	7043960	Jim Davis will probably be back in town.
7043960	7045960	Come here, if I'm in town.
7045960	7050960	He's gonna fuck a dead person tonight.
7050960	7052960	What are we hoping with D&D next?
7052960	7054960	What's up?
7054960	7057960	We're gonna open with D&D right after Dan Harmon shows you
7057960	7060960	his newly sculpted titties.
7060960	7063960	Jeff B. Davis titty plans removal.
7063960	7065960	Three-day system.
7065960	7068960	Go online.
7068960	7070960	Boston, buy your tickets to Boston.
7070960	7074960	Yeah, Boston on January 22nd, the Wilbur Theater.
7074960	7078960	It's gonna be wicked, retarded, and possibly a pisser.
7078960	7081960	And also the 23rd Long Island somewhere at the aviation.
7081960	7088960	Clint Glamin with joints and fish fry.
7111960	7115960	Did you get any of that?
