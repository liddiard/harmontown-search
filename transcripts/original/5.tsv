0	26000	Here ye, here ye, oh yes, oh yes, hey 99, welcome to Harman Town everybody, how are you today?
27000	35000	As Comptroller of Harman Town, I Jeff Davis officially declare this session of Harman Town to be in session.
36000	41000	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
41000	58000	Thank you. Thank you. You're a good crowd. You're a good crowd. I don't say that every week.
59000	61000	Because they aren't always good crowds?
61000	65000	No, no. I won't get away with that lie anymore because we're on the internet now.
65000	71000	I am notoriously bad at opening shows, case in point, what I just did. What was that?
72000	75000	But I want you to think of it as more of an evolution of performance on stage.
76000	83000	The Almighty Mud Skipper, for instance, and the link between fish and breathing reptile.
84000	90000	Well, not a graceful entrance, but perhaps one of the most important things that ever happened.
90000	100000	A floundering, slimy, sweaty, gross thing, gasping for air and mud. Think about it, next time you're about to judge somebody.
101000	105000	So this show is flopping its way onto the shore of entertainment?
106000	113000	Yeah. Here's another awkward transition to a greater world. Maybe you heard of him. Jesus Christ.
114000	118000	Don't you feel a little bad about how you welcomed him?
119000	123000	So I ask you again, are you having a good time tonight?
124000	134000	I'm kidding. Sorry. I don't even want to lose people. It leverages people emotionally. I didn't mean to do that.
135000	141000	The theme of tonight is confession. If we're going to found a new colony, as we will one day, I promise,
142000	148000	and we're going to talk about the Mars developments later, Jeff has a theory that I think is very important for him to confess.
149000	150000	We'll get to this.
151000	158000	Or we won't, because we're both drunk and that segues me into what I think is the more important theme.
159000	164000	But I'll just say to you later, if the show's dragging later, as opposed to now.
165000	168000	This rocket ship that we're on right now.
169000	172000	If you see this look on her face that you may have sometimes seen where we're like,
173000	174000	Jim Henson?
175000	183000	Feel free to shout out Mars, and we'll get Jeff started on his obsessive theories about what's happening there right now.
184000	185000	I can stand by everything I think.
186000	190000	But I want to start with the theme of confession, partly because our surprise guest tonight,
190000	194000	I think he's a good way to start things out, and I want to get him out of here because he's doing us a favor.
195000	201000	I don't have a lot of guests anymore. I went on our following guest's podcast live in San Francisco
202000	205000	months and months and months ago during the Comedy Festival in San Francisco,
206000	214000	and they had some preamble to their podcast. There's four guys that host it, or maybe there was only two.
217000	219000	I don't know. I walked in pretty drunk.
220000	221000	And they all did stand up.
222000	227000	Why were you that drunk? You knew that you were at a comedy festival. You're a professional.
228000	229000	Why did you show up that drunk?
234000	236000	The show was on at 8 and you just started drinking at 2 or what?
237000	244000	I think it was on at, let's say it was on at 9 and I got there at 8.30, but then I wasn't on until midnight.
245000	247000	That was part of my whole shtick. If you listen to the thing, I come out and I'm like,
247000	256000	you kept me waiting back there. I was doing a bit. My bag of tricks is like, I go, I'm angry.
257000	261000	It's a dumb bit. I just fall back on it. My dad hit me too much.
262000	266000	I think it's funny to come out and go, I was waiting backstage forever.
267000	271000	Then I started making fun of them for doing stand-up, which precipitated in me making fun of stand-up in general,
271000	276000	which resulted in me over and over and over again. And for those of you who are alcoholics,
277000	281000	you know that the first thing that goes out the window is your sense of overkill and timing.
282000	287000	You become a six-year-old child who's just like, well, this is funny. And if they stop laughing,
288000	290000	I'll just wait for them to remember how funny it is.
291000	293000	It's called Harmontown.
294000	300000	I kept doing this joke over and over and over again where I was just doing a joke about jokes.
301000	306000	It was like pretending to be a stand-up and going, well, black people are on a podcast like this,
307000	311000	and white people are on a podcast like that. And that reaction happened, the silence.
312000	317000	When I was growing up, it was a big deal. You point out the differences between black people and white people.
318000	323000	It was very celebrated, very funny. I picked the wrong decade to lampoon that.
324000	327000	I picked the wrong substance to lampoon it on, for all I know.
327000	331000	But most of this is a blur to me. The important thing about tonight's story before I bring him up,
332000	337000	this is how I want to introduce him because I barely know this guy. I was on his podcast once. I've met him twice.
338000	344000	He was here last week because he was finishing a podcast upstairs here at Meltdown with John Krickfalousie.
345000	349000	And I happened to bump into him, hey, how are you? I haven't seen you since I ruined your podcast.
350000	354000	Why haven't you aired it? And I expected the answer to be, well, because you're a big, sloppy, drunk shithead
354000	360000	and you fucked up the whole thing and it's unearable. Which I would accept, but I would also be like, fuck you, you prude.
361000	367000	If that was his answer. His answer was, well, you know, by the time we started being ready to release it,
368000	375000	that Chevy Chase thing happened. And then that happened and we waited for that to cool out. And then, like, you got fired.
376000	383000	And there was no point in time where I felt like, ah, we're doing this guy a big favor by airing this episode.
384000	392000	But he said that. It was like, wow, you're a good guy. Would you come up tonight? You want to be a guest thing?
393000	397000	And I was like, dude, I know you have dinner plans. He's like, yeah, maybe next week. And he showed up tonight.
398000	402000	He showed up in the green room and I said, how quick can we get you out of here? He said, as quick as possible.
403000	409000	And I've already betrayed him. But I wanted to make sure my introduction was fitting because I want you to know,
409000	414000	because I don't know that much about him. I only know that about him, which I think is a lot.
415000	419000	He's a gentleman in a world without gentlemen. I want I want to I don't know what we're going to do with him.
420000	425000	Let's just talk to him, maybe tee off a theme of confession. Ladies and gentlemen, Doug Benson.
430000	434000	Well, sorry, what? I didn't know who was. I just presumed.
434000	438000	Please. I just presumed. Please welcome to what is basically his own stage, Chris Hardwick.
446000	447000	Hello, Dan Harmon.
454000	455000	Oh, my God. Thank God.
455000	460000	I'm a pussy fever. I don't want the cure.
461000	465000	Sad now. That's a thing from community. And it's so sad now.
468000	474000	You know, you should drop the song down into a minor key. So sad. Pussy fever.
475000	483000	When you when you research St. Patty's Day and you find out the colors and people got slaughtered and you dig deep in any holiday and you find out
483000	488000	some guy got hung upside down and eviscerated. Now pussy. Now pussy fevers like the book Hot Zone.
489000	494000	Everyone's I don't know what that means. That was the monkey book.
495000	501000	That was a brave confession. No, thank you. See, we're confessing tonight. That's good. That was a night. That was a nice. That was a nice long intro.
502000	509000	The truth of the matter was I was worried that because you were making fun of stand up, which I know as a comedian.
509000	513000	Right. And the audience was way on board with you at first for the first.
515000	527000	And then there's a point until I tried to introduce them to what I call the rule of eight teens, the rule and comedy teens, which is one through nine. Really funny. Ten through fifteen.
528000	535000	Wow. And then sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Even more hilarious. Andy Kaufman is reborn. This is a picture I took of you.
536000	551000	It's a picture of me. I look like a frog. It looks like a dance drunk on the stage. Basically that it looks like it looks like a toddler photograph from a Sears portrait studio because I was learning to walk.
552000	562000	And this is this is where you were like, you're going to the stage. You were grinding your junk into the stage going back. People do this and white people do this.
563000	573000	And there was no there was no there was no subject. It was. And so at a certain point, you know, a couple of people were like, hey, and I just didn't.
573000	585000	It was not at all about race. Nothing you were doing was actually about race. But I just didn't. When the when the Chevy thing broke, I didn't want it to be another like TMZ or someone goes and look at this offensive thing he's doing over there.
586000	595000	This guy is full of. I had become Charlie Sheen for for like a most exhilarating three weeks of my life. And I was Charlie Sheen. I mean, a very minor scale.
595000	603000	And if people if people don't get weird, I just didn't want people to make it about something that it was never about. It was about you making fun of us because he came out.
603000	614000	We did. You didn't go on a midnight. It was. But it wasn't early. And so, OK, maybe we have some attention here. No, no, no, but I was waiting back there long enough to drink two bottles of Grey Goose.
615000	618000	That's how I measure time. I don't know.
618000	631000	So we, you know, we did stand up on top of the show and then you and then you came out and I love that you were making fun of us and you're making fun of Santa.
631000	639000	It was so much. It was such a great dynamic on the show. But we always want people to feel like, you know, fun and celebrated and positive and safe and safe.
639000	648000	And you just didn't want, you know, I just didn't want the wrong person to take something that they read in a headline out of context and say, oh, that Dan Harmon did this.
648000	656000	It's like, no, you weren't there. He wasn't about that at all. And so that that's all. It was just sort of my story is it doesn't even matter if you're right or wrong.
656000	664000	The fact that that's the diamond loop you have in your eye when you're looking at anything makes you one of the last true gentlemen in a horrible wasteland.
665000	672000	Really, we're all eating each other. I mean, I would like to think I would also the thought that thought would also cross my mind partly.
672000	677000	I don't know. But but I was like I was astounded. It was like I did not expect to hear that coming out of your mouth.
677000	685000	I really don't know you. And I for you to extend me that courtesy. I expected to see a guy ride by on a giant bicycle.
685000	692000	I felt I felt like we were in an era where you put your pinky out when you drank and you put a cape over the thing.
692000	699000	It was just like it seemed like second nature to you. Like you had enough problems going on back then. Yeah, I just didn't want to I just didn't want to add that.
699000	703000	And it was. And but the truth of the matter is the audio on live shows is very, very difficult.
703000	710000	We do get a lot of complaints in that because we set four mics are set on the table and people lean back. People lean forward.
710000	715000	You know, the audience is mike separately and audio levels on live shows are just very hard to to normalize.
715000	720000	So that that was actually the other issue. So it really it really it really was a couple of things.
720000	727000	But it was a really fun show. And I'm glad that you did it. And we'll have you back on. Also, racism levels are hard to realize, too.
727000	737000	I don't know. Well, I think it's also hard to on a podcast to to really get the sensation of a white man humping a stage.
737000	742000	Yeah. Supposedly lampooning something while inventing a new art form himself.
742000	747000	Well, yeah, I mean, I think people here know, but it's a classic. It's sort of a classic stand up.
747000	756000	You know, when you're making fun of stand up comedy, you say things like men and women are like this in San Francisco and New York are like this and flying is like this and black people do this.
756000	763000	The Simpsons, the Simpsons have the classic, you know, black people drive a car like this to do it, you know, white people like classics, the important word.
763000	768000	I was doing it 20 years after everyone already got the job. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
768000	774000	It's that one since episode where we're homeless on the couch and he's watching. He's like, it's true. We're so lame or whatever.
774000	780000	And it's like and they made, you know, like they so that is a classic stand up making fun of stand up joke.
780000	783000	But I just didn't want people to misconstrue what you what it was actually.
783000	789000	I thought it was amazing. My philosophy is I got drunk when on your show and send stuff into a recorder.
789000	795000	And also, I'm currently famous for playing a guy's voicemail into a thing. I don't think you can go ahead.
795000	798000	Let it loose. My deals are closed with CBS and Fox.
798000	803000	My favorite, my favorite part about my favorite part about how druggy was, he came out, you're like, you would talk for a second.
803000	806000	You're like, yeah, you know, he visioned Jack.
806000	813000	I am so drunk and it is your fault. It is your motherfucking fault that I am this drunk.
813000	817000	I've been backstage for five hours. It wasn't really five hours.
817000	820000	But you but it must have felt like must have. But we should.
820000	823000	But I do have to apologize. We should not have all done stand up before you came out.
823000	827000	We should have just brought you out. Well, you shouldn't have met my headline.
829000	833000	I know that I just said that to get a laugh and I didn't get it.
833000	838000	We're going to get a confession out of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I said to you backstage.
838000	841000	Because here's the other thing about Chris and I don't know how public it is and how much it isn't.
841000	848000	But I know that my girlfriend, after I did this, after I did this debacle, it was it was after that that my girlfriend, Aaron,
848000	855000	who came to San Francisco with me and watched this whole thing, she was like, you know, part of that might have been a little bit of this.
855000	860000	You know, Chris is sober. He used to drink. Now he doesn't anymore.
860000	863000	And it's like people that used to drink and now don't anymore.
863000	867000	Like a good 85 percent of them are pretty uncomfortable around. No, no, no.
867000	873000	It's a good reminder that I made the right choice. Yeah, that's how I'd think of it.
873000	879000	That's how I'd assume. But I never I don't care. I've been I've been sober for nine years.
879000	884000	Like I don't even remember. I have I have flashes of like, oh, yeah, I used to be that guy.
884000	893000	I've now pawned it off on I had this fat brother named Peter and he used to fuck shit up like I don't even take responsibility for it anymore.
893000	896000	So but I thought because tonight's theme is confessions. Yeah.
896000	901000	We're having to come up and I'm confessing that I ruined your podcast and I did it because I'm an alcoholic.
901000	904000	No, no, no, it wasn't. You're a great stand up guy. No, no, no.
904000	913000	I was wondering if you in the green room, I said, like maybe in classic sober fashion, maybe you have a confession.
913000	917000	A couple drunk. I can I can give you a couple drunk confessions.
917000	921000	One is one is sort of a cool story, bro, because it doesn't really go anywhere.
921000	927000	But in 2001, I went to London and I was visiting.
927000	930000	I just went to London for a couple of weeks because you can literally drink everywhere in London.
930000	936000	Like you can drink in museums, you can drink in zoos, like everywhere just has alcohol and they think it's adorable and charming.
936000	941000	And I just when I started to know I had a problem was like, wow, I really fit in here.
941000	946000	Like I knew I had a problem. And because I was just all about it all the time.
946000	950000	And and Zek Galifianakis was out there shooting a submarine movie called Below.
950000	956000	And so I stayed with him for a couple of days. And he we went out one night and he was with these.
956000	960000	The other actors in the movie were these like pretty schmancy British actor types.
960000	965000	And so we went to all these underground British clubs and I got really fucking drunk.
965000	973000	And at about three a.m. somewhere in London, I tried to hit on Bjork.
973000	975000	All right. I got it.
975000	980000	That headline works in tabloid format with an exclamation point.
980000	983000	I tried to hit on Bjork. I tried to hit on Bjork.
983000	986000	Can you what was your first move?
986000	990000	My first move was staring at her for an hour and a half. Right.
990000	994000	That's actually good because she's fascinated by fire hydrants. She is.
995000	998000	She probably mythologized you.
998000	1006000	Yes. Whenever she speaks, this weird subtitle with a brush script font appears.
1006000	1010000	And so, you know, I was I was I was basically just like this.
1010000	1014000	I must have felt like it was like 10 minutes, but it really was like an hour and a half.
1014000	1019000	And so Zek and all these all of his smash smashy British actor friends were like, yeah.
1019000	1022000	If we go and I'm like, no, man, I'm only going to make my move.
1022000	1024000	I'm going to hit on Bjork.
1024000	1027000	And she was talking to some other people.
1027000	1030000	And then finally, they were ready to leave.
1030000	1032000	And I'm like, OK, I'm going to do it.
1032000	1039000	And so I walk up to her and I tap her on the shoulder and she she turns around like this, you know, just looking all Bjorky.
1039000	1050000	And and I and I'm like, like, I take the breath in to go to ask her a question and she sees me and immediately just turns around and scampers up.
1051000	1054000	She may have disappeared in a pile of dust or been swallowed by the earth.
1054000	1056000	I'm not 100 percent sure she's from Iceland.
1056000	1058000	She knows when she's getting a puke.
1062000	1065000	I don't know. She's turned into a pyro pile of fire salts.
1065000	1066000	And then I don't know what happened.
1066000	1068000	You never even had a conversation with her.
1068000	1070000	And it was such a failure.
1070000	1073000	And and then it's like she immediately started talking to some other guy.
1073000	1079000	So we all like I have to like walk with all these people who I'd been making wait forever for this
1079000	1081000	utter moment of failure.
1081000	1084000	And we end up going back and, you know, hanging out.
1084000	1091000	And then I was sitting on the bed and Zach videotaped me being really bummed that I totally struck out with Bjork.
1093000	1095000	And I'm like, are you saying her by name?
1095000	1097000	And yeah, I'm saying her by name.
1097000	1101000	Bjork. And then she I think I said, like, and then this other guy showed up.
1101000	1103000	He totally cock Bjorked me.
1103000	1109000	And which I really said that.
1109000	1120000	But I was genuinely bummed that in my in my drunken state of mind that that I had this moment that was a total like I would have had any chance to mine.
1120000	1122000	This is something that I constantly want to ask.
1122000	1129000	And I probably the coolest sober person I've ever talked to in my life appears as a perfect time to ask this.
1129000	1130000	I hear that story.
1130000	1131000	Perfect example.
1131000	1134000	I go, so why aren't you still drinking?
1134000	1136000	What's wrong with that?
1136000	1140000	You got to get back on the Bjork saddle and fucking.
1140000	1143000	Well, I mean, I talked to other people.
1143000	1146000	They go like, yeah, I woke up in a puddle of blood and I kept doing that third time a day.
1146000	1148000	Yeah, you got to stop waking up in puddles of blood.
1148000	1150000	Well, no, you get a dark one.
1150000	1152000	Don't don't think of it as a comedy show.
1152000	1158000	Give us a second one and then I'll let you go to dinner with Bjork.
1158000	1159000	A dark one.
1159000	1165000	You know, it wasn't it wasn't just that there was like it wasn't any specifically that any one thing happened.
1165000	1171000	It's just when I look back at what my life was like back then, I had been on MTV in the 90s and there was a sort of unspoken curse.
1171000	1178000	Like, well, if you're on MTV, like that's it, you know, like you probably won't do anything else after that because a lot of people didn't.
1178000	1181000	And the business was less forgiving back then for crossing over.
1181000	1191000	Like if you were VJ, if you're on MTV, it was like, yeah, you know, sort of like being what people consider like being an Internet personality now, you know, and someday that'll change.
1191000	1193000	Or it's in the process of changing.
1193000	1200000	And so I just I was I had I was like chunky and blotchy and I didn't I wasn't working.
1200000	1204000	And I think I just kind of looked at the sort of like, here's the landscape of my life.
1204000	1206000	I can keep doing this, which would be fine.
1206000	1212000	You know, like I wasn't I never had to go to the hospital except for one time.
1212000	1216000	I jumped over a wall and like fucked up my foot like that was it.
1216000	1218000	And I was also fat and I had these leather pants.
1218000	1221000	It was really embarrassing.
1221000	1222000	Never wear leather.
1222000	1223000	No, no one.
1223000	1227000	Were you fat and in leather pants when you tried to pick up Bjork?
1227000	1230000	Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
1230000	1231000	Jeff put it together.
1231000	1232000	You know what?
1232000	1233000	You know what?
1233000	1242000	I think in my drunken mind, I'm like, I was like Jim Morrison, you know, like that guy with leather pants.
1242000	1247000	One day some hot girl is going to blow me in an elevator and that never happened.
1247000	1249000	That never, ever, ever happened.
1249000	1255000	And so I think I just you know, I just kind of get the truthfully like sincerely, I just got to a point.
1255000	1262000	It wasn't anything specifically bad happened, but just a period of my life was just sort of like a dark ages where nothing really moved forward.
1262000	1264000	And it just kind of kept getting worse and worse.
1264000	1271000	And I just thought, you know, right when I was about 30, 31, I was like, you know, I can stand this path and that's fine.
1271000	1277000	I don't black out drunk, but nothing else really substantial is probably really going to happen in my life.
1277000	1285000	But I also realized, wow, I have this crazy ability to focus on something like I'm clearly addicted to alcohol.
1285000	1288000	So, you know, what if I could refocus that?
1288000	1297000	You know, so like there was this idea of maybe I could take this demon that I had and figure out how to spin it in a way where I could use it instead of denying that I had it.
1297000	1303000	So I did, you know, I go on, OK, as Jeff goes to the vodka bucket.
1303000	1305000	And so, you know, I did.
1305000	1309000	And then when I quit, then I realized like, oh, yeah, I had all these problems that I wasn't dealing with.
1309000	1314000	And then, you know, there was a little period where I where I had to, you know, fix the brain.
1314000	1318000	Every conversation I have with people, I go, like, first question is, are you an alcoholic?
1318000	1321000	I immediately I can't say yes, fast enough.
1321000	1324000	The reason the reason is because I've I caught on to the game.
1324000	1327000	If you say no, you're an alcoholic. Right. Oh, yeah.
1327000	1331000	Some people some people will like, oh, you're in denial, huh? You're like, but you didn't even give me the.
1331000	1334000	Yeah, I just I just I just click the blue wire right away.
1334000	1340000	I don't care if it blows up or diffuses the bomb, but I'm not going to stand there and go.
1340000	1348000	It sounds like an alcoholic because 85 percent of everyone is a dick.
1348000	1353000	Yeah. 85 percent of all drunks are dicks and 85 percent of all sober people are dicks.
1353000	1356000	And you meet less sober people than you meet drugs.
1356000	1363000	So if you're drunk and you meet the sober person, 85 percent chance you're going to have a fucking bad time because you don't meet that many.
1363000	1365000	And 85 percent of them are dicks.
1365000	1374000	And and what in a sober dick is somebody who gets as much identity from being sober as a drunk gets out of being drunk.
1374000	1377000	Like you met them when you were drunk. You met them when they were drunk.
1377000	1382000	Like they their alcohol is their life. I'm a drunk. I love being drunk.
1382000	1386000	Let's drink. And then they and then they find Jesus or they get sober.
1386000	1390000	And then it's like, I'm sober. Are you sober? I'm sober.
1390000	1393000	Some people talk like this over people.
1399000	1401000	But I never knew you were sober.
1401000	1406000	I met you. I walked into your life pissed on your stage.
1406000	1410000	Yep. I raped your dog.
1410000	1414000	Did a shot of Fernet Branca walked out and then someone else told me, you know, he's sober.
1414000	1417000	Oh, but I don't really. It doesn't never bother me because I don't.
1417000	1421000	You know, I'm definitely not someone who looks around everyone.
1421000	1424000	They're like, well, that person should probably like I have my problems.
1424000	1427000	Other people have their own path. I just don't fucking you know, like that.
1427000	1429000	That's just how that's just how it is for me.
1429000	1432000	I just don't tell people I don't judge people that way.
1432000	1435000	All right. How do we how do you judge people?
1439000	1442000	Do you want to plug anything or you don't need to. You're King Kong.
1442000	1446000	No, no, no, no, no. I'm just glad that you're doing the show here weekly now.
1446000	1451000	I mean, it's really fun. And I love for anyone who's listening before people support that.
1451000	1454000	But I love for anyone who's listening to this podcast.
1454000	1458000	You should really know like Dan walks the line when people are lining up, get suggestions,
1458000	1461000	talks to people like there's a very there's a very communal thing.
1461000	1464000	Are you enjoying your time here? It must be nice therapy.
1464000	1467000	I can't. I won't do therapy. I can't do it.
1467000	1469000	What do you what do you not like about therapy?
1469000	1474000	It's dumb people. Oh, shit. Holy shit.
1474000	1478000	Mothra just flew on stage flying cockroach.
1478000	1483000	The flying cockroach the size of a hubcap just hit Dan in the chest.
1483000	1485000	The hair stood in the back of my head.
1485000	1487000	I thought somebody threw a frisbee.
1487000	1491000	I thought I thought a group of therapists got busted.
1491000	1496000	I thought I was going to get fucking murdered by the middle of the bell curve.
1496000	1501000	I thought that people with the minimal requirements for degrees.
1501000	1503000	Yeah. And judging people.
1503000	1508000	You call it you call it a demographic stupid and a giant animal.
1508000	1511000	That's an argument for shamanism.
1511000	1514000	Actually, I didn't say shamanism was bullshit.
1514000	1517000	Snake snake.
1517000	1520000	I like to think that that was the drunk fairy.
1520000	1528000	But it's undoing ironically.
1528000	1530000	The thing is not dead. Can we kill it?
1530000	1532000	We crushed it. Someone crushed it.
1532000	1537000	A hero in our audience stepped forward and slayed the dragon.
1537000	1540000	Quickly, man. Quickly.
1540000	1542000	The greatest adventure.
1542000	1548000	Fetch me a toothpick. We must place its head on a spike to warn its compatriots.
1548000	1550000	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1550000	1554000	Dude, you fucking destroyed.
1554000	1558000	Didn't even flinch. Just got up and just dispatched it.
1558000	1563000	Emily's coming up with a napkin like it's 50s radio.
1563000	1569000	My question is, what if that was Bjork in fairy form?
1569000	1577000	I have been summoned to somebody who has spoken my name three times.
1577000	1583000	And then she shows up and then blam.
1583000	1588000	She had her chance when you were fattening in leather.
1588000	1591000	No fairy would have seen the prince that you were going to become.
1591000	1592000	That's right. She didn't know.
1592000	1594000	Let's thank Chris Hardwick for coming.
1594000	1603000	Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Dan Harmon. Thank you, Jeff Davis.
1603000	1606000	Thank you, Chris. That was delightful.
1606000	1610000	I can't think of a better closer. I don't know how to close it.
1610000	1612000	I warned him in the green room. I don't know how to do interviews.
1612000	1615000	But please come up because I want to tell people how cool you are.
1615000	1618000	For all I know, he could be a rapist. I don't know.
1618000	1620000	I don't know anything about him. I know two things about him.
1620000	1623000	And they suggest that he's like a knight in shining armor.
1623000	1625000	He seems like a cool guy.
1625000	1626000	Yeah, I see right through it.
1626000	1628000	I won't listen to...
1628000	1633000	You caught up immediately. You zeroed in on the leather pants thing.
1633000	1635000	You're like, what were you wearing?
1635000	1637000	He's telling the story.
1637000	1641000	I would guess that if you're really drunk and you're floating with Bjork
1641000	1643000	and you're at a low point in your life,
1643000	1647000	you probably also are fat and have leather pants on.
1647000	1649000	It takes a Jeff to notice these things.
1649000	1650000	We all just heard...
1650000	1651000	It takes a Jeff.
1651000	1654000	All we heard is that Bjork's a bitch.
1654000	1657000	Anyways. No, he's cool.
1657000	1660000	Also, real quickly, that Chris Hardwick section of Harmontown
1660000	1661000	was brought to you by...
1661000	1664000	Adidas. Nike.
1665000	1668000	Yes, all of Harmontown is brought to you by
1668000	1672000	the top-of-the-line, comfort-fitting, state-of-the-art shoe.
1672000	1676000	Yeah, strap on the smooth comfort and easy walkability of Adidas.
1676000	1678000	You pieces of shit at Nike.
1678000	1681000	We're doing this for free for Adidas until you pony up some money.
1681000	1682000	Fucking...
1682000	1686000	We're inverting the advertising paradigm.
1686000	1691000	Nike, pay us money to make us stop telling you
1691000	1694000	that Adidas is the most perfect shoe
1694000	1697000	you will ever wear in your fucking life.
1697000	1701000	It's like putting your foot into a uterus of comfort.
1701000	1703000	Who's working for who?
1703000	1706000	Pick up a phone, Nike, you douchebags.
1706000	1708000	Adidas isn't paying us a dime.
1708000	1711000	We just decided to fucking love them.
1711000	1713000	Nike.
1713000	1716000	Yeah, we're gonna strong arm Nike into it.
1716000	1720000	It might cost a dollar to make us stop advertising Adidas.
1720000	1723000	Unless Puma gives us ten.
1723000	1728000	Anybody can beat Greg Proops and get Spotify or the...
1728000	1732000	Adam and Eve, audible.com, yawn, yawn.
1732000	1736000	What is this? This feels terrible with Aaron McGathey?
1736000	1739000	One of these bullshit...
1739000	1743000	It's new and noteworthy, but I don't see it in the top ten.
1743000	1746000	I don't see it in the hard numbers.
1746000	1748000	This feels terrible with Aaron McGathey.
1748000	1751000	It's new, it's noteworthy. What does that mean?
1751000	1756000	Our show is the Adidas of podcasts until further notice.
1756000	1762000	You hear that, you Nike cocksuckers?
1762000	1765000	You're throwing money away.
1765000	1768000	There's other techniques we could try next week.
1768000	1773000	Nike, next week, we're gonna start coming at you from different angles.
1773000	1780000	We're gonna start saying we like Nike, and we're gonna have pillowcases on our heads.
1780000	1783000	We're gonna have swastikas on our foreheads.
1783000	1786000	I would say as a podcast, let's do something less visual.
1786000	1791000	Yeah, you're right, you're right, sorry.
1791000	1794000	We're gonna say that was Nike's idea.
1794000	1797000	We're gonna die broke thinking like that, man, come on.
1797000	1799000	All right, all right, all right, all right, sorry.
1799000	1803000	I've never been a Madison Avenue type.
1803000	1812000	Confession, so Chris Hardwick was very, very gracious to tell us about his former life as a fun-loving drunkable.
1812000	1814000	He confessed some things.
1814000	1816000	He told us things that he was embarrassed about.
1816000	1819000	I've been going through the stack of audience submissions.
1819000	1822000	I pulled a few aside. There's some really dark ones in here.
1822000	1828000	Do you want to talk about, I only have, I'll read down the list of things that I have on my list of things to talk about.
1828000	1829000	Adidas?
1829000	1830000	Right.
1830000	1831000	Check.
1831000	1832000	Confessions?
1832000	1833000	Check.
1833000	1835000	Mustard butts a lot?
1835000	1836000	Nope.
1836000	1843000	That's a quickie, we were at the drawing room, and Dan was talking about people in high school that are,
1843000	1845000	if you have a silly name, right?
1845000	1853000	I was illustrating the point that if you had a silly name, and this is one of those things that we've talked, at an end point,
1853000	1859000	we've talked about this in the show, so if any of you have been here, don't feel cheated.
1859000	1863000	Now that we're podcasting, we're breaking out the chest.
1863000	1866000	Edit, out point.
1866000	1869000	If any of you wanted to just yell out,
1869000	1874000	I hate Mexicans, you should have done it in there.
1874000	1876000	Now it's on the record.
1876000	1878000	I don't know what that means.
1878000	1880000	I don't know why I'm so racist.
1880000	1881000	Why are you so racist?
1881000	1882000	Why is everything about race?
1882000	1883000	You're fascinated by race.
1883000	1888000	Because it was brought up, you get to not be racist, and I just think that's something that people care about.
1888000	1892000	You marvel at Mexicans and Asians and black people.
1892000	1897000	Because it's like, okay, when you go bowling, your job is to...
1897000	1899000	Oh, here we go.
1899000	1902000	The reason I'm fascinated with race, I think.
1902000	1906000	This is my defense of my fascination with race and racism.
1906000	1908000	When you go bowling, you never see black people...
1908000	1910000	No, I'm kidding.
1911000	1913000	That's what you thought I was going to say, isn't it?
1913000	1916000	No, when you go bowling, there's pins down there,
1916000	1921000	and the goal of bowling is you take a ball and you roll it.
1921000	1927000	The reason why it's a sport and not just a thing that you do is because of these gutters.
1927000	1932000	The gutters represent this thing, and by default what happens is your ball rolls into the gutter,
1932000	1934000	and you don't hit a single pin.
1934000	1937000	So you have to thread this needle with bowling.
1937000	1940000	And with communication and with culture and stuff,
1940000	1944000	I said with our perception of what race is and what racism is,
1944000	1947000	we're so obsessed with it, and I'm always fascinated by the gutter.
1947000	1951000	I'm fascinated by the fact that, oh, if it goes too far to the left,
1951000	1955000	it just goes in there, and that's the default response.
1955000	1958000	And I don't know, are we...
1958000	1961000	Is the guy that owns the bowling alley the right guy?
1961000	1964000	Is the guy that's making all the money off of us threading this needle?
1964000	1967000	Is he laughing all the way to the bank?
1967000	1970000	And is that the right bank?
1970000	1973000	Where are you going with this?
1973000	1977000	If that's not interesting to you guys, you deserve Jeff Davis' Mars...
1977000	1980000	I didn't bring it up. I didn't bring it up.
1980000	1983000	I will take the time to tell you that...
1983000	1986000	Wait, who's the hero in that bowling story?
1986000	1990000	The person that's bowling is just any person, any person at all.
1990000	1991000	It's a human being.
1991000	1994000	It's just the gutter.
1994000	1998000	Mars! Mars!
1998000	2000000	The gutter represents the fact that...
2000000	2001000	All right, Mars.
2001000	2003000	Mars!
2003000	2006000	Holy shit.
2006000	2010000	Rob Schwab has become downright mutinous.
2010000	2012000	I'm telling you something.
2012000	2016000	I was going to say talk to me after the show, but don't.
2016000	2018000	Talk to me before next week's show.
2018000	2021000	Let's all go bowling. That sounds really wild.
2021000	2025000	Or pledge $2,500 to the Anomalisa Kickstarter
2025000	2027000	and go drinking with me and Dino.
2027000	2031000	And I'll tell you all about the bowling metaphor, which I just landed on.
2031000	2034000	I just made it up now. It's fucking perfect.
2034000	2036000	I'm on to something. I'm going to write a book,
2036000	2039000	and I'm not going to share with any of you the profits.
2039000	2041000	You're not going to get a free copy. You're not going to get anything.
2041000	2043000	Because you didn't support me.
2043000	2046000	You backed a hooligan and my friend.
2046000	2050000	And also, that was brought to you by Nike.
2050000	2054000	My thoughts on racism are brought to you by Nike.
2054000	2058000	A shitty shoe in a dark world.
2058000	2061000	A crappy, cynical, fucking horrible world.
2061000	2063000	A shared shoe that stinks.
2063000	2065000	It's a stinky shoe.
2065000	2067000	You put your foot in it, and I think there's a mouse in there.
2067000	2068000	Nike.
2068000	2069000	Bullshit.
2069000	2074000	The guy that stepped on the Bjork fairy, Cockroach, Adidas.
2074000	2078000	Just don't do it.
2078000	2080000	All right, now what is your beef with me and Mars?
2080000	2083000	We're talking about the curiosity as of the reporting of us.
2083000	2084000	Let's do this quick.
2084000	2085000	And believe me, I don't know.
2085000	2088000	There's been some contention that was erupted between you and me.
2088000	2092000	But I want you to tell people, because I'm interested in you.
2092000	2094000	I'm going to stop me if I'm wrong.
2094000	2100000	Jeff has become convinced since his tour of the JPL facility at NASA,
2100000	2103000	where he thinks, as in most of Jeff's stories,
2103000	2107000	those of you who are hardcore Armenians,
2107000	2112000	you know that when Jeff tells a story, there's a theme.
2112000	2114000	Don't interrupt me.
2114000	2115000	You're talking about me.
2115000	2116000	Why would I?
2116000	2121000	I'm going to make up a story and try to fill it to the Jeff Davis template
2121000	2123000	of storytelling.
2123000	2129000	Jeff goes to a laundromat, and he puts a shirt in the washing machine,
2129000	2133000	and a beautiful Cuban woman is watching him.
2133000	2137000	And she comes over, and she asks him why he's putting his shirt
2137000	2140000	in the washing machine in quite that way.
2140000	2142000	And he explains, I don't know.
2142000	2145000	I thought that this shirt needed to be cleaned first.
2145000	2150000	And she puts a hand on his arm and says, thank you.
2150000	2152000	And then she takes him back and introduces her family,
2152000	2156000	and then she just fucks him blue.
2156000	2157000	Jeff has these stories.
2157000	2158000	I don't think they're false.
2158000	2160000	I think these things happen to Jeff.
2160000	2162000	Jeff falls into these adventures, the kind of revolver.
2162000	2167000	And his personality is people trust him, and they open up to him,
2167000	2169000	and they want him to like them and things.
2169000	2173000	So Jeff went to the JPL facility, Jet Propulsion Lab.
2173000	2175000	Is that what that stands for?
2175000	2178000	Seems a little uninventive for rocket scientists.
2178000	2182000	I was invited by a friend to go to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
2182000	2184000	and it was a tour from a guy that works.
2184000	2186000	And I won't get too specific about his job,
2186000	2189000	because I think that he was going to get in trouble for saying too much.
2189000	2191000	So suffice to say, I go on a tour.
2191000	2194000	And there's a tour that everybody can go see.
2194000	2197000	And you can see a little mock-up of the Voyager probe and the Cassini
2197000	2198000	and stuff like that.
2198000	2199000	And it's very cool.
2199000	2201000	I like space travel stuff.
2201000	2206000	And we're going kind of a little bit behind the scenes.
2206000	2208000	He's like, this is not kind of on the regular tour,
2208000	2211000	because I work on such and such a program.
2211000	2214000	And we get to go see the rooms where they're building,
2214000	2218000	what is now called Curiosity, that I think last night successfully
2218000	2219000	landed on Mars.
2219000	2222000	And yeah.
2222000	2223000	Very cool.
2223000	2227000	Back then they called the Mars Science Laboratory,
2227000	2229000	like another uncreative.
2229000	2232000	Yeah, and these people are real Shakespeare's over there.
2232000	2233000	And so we saw it.
2233000	2236000	And it was just this big gigantic thing about the size of a Prius.
2236000	2240000	And it's got a big meaningful, heavy backhoe shovel on it
2240000	2244000	and giant wheels about 10 to 12 inches across.
2244000	2246000	This thing was mean.
2246000	2248000	The rovers were the size of a coffee table.
2248000	2251000	We're going back there with a purpose, some big robust.
2251000	2253000	The previous one had little arms on it.
2253000	2255000	It was like, we don't know if a funny bottle of wine,
2255000	2257000	so there's a corkscrew.
2257000	2260000	We might have to kill a moth, so there's a little moth there.
2260000	2261000	We don't know what's going to happen.
2261000	2262000	There's wheels on top and bottom.
2262000	2263000	This thing was a bulldozer.
2263000	2265000	We're sending a bulldozer to Mars.
2265000	2267000	This thing's going digging and analyzing.
2267000	2270000	And it's very intense, and the people are very nervous.
2270000	2273000	So now that thing that I got to see a little peek out,
2273000	2275000	it's also very cool and very human.
2275000	2278000	It made me so proud of humanity, is laying on this titanium chassis
2278000	2280000	with these big wheels in the corner and this big shovel,
2280000	2283000	with just a good old proper crescent wrench.
2283000	2285000	Just some dude's wrench.
2285000	2289000	Snap-on tools, you know, the Adidas of tools.
2289000	2291000	You hear that, Nike?
2291000	2295000	You pieces of shit.
2295000	2297000	It was such cowards.
2297000	2299000	So it was very cool.
2299000	2301000	So we're walking around the hallways.
2301000	2303000	I'm talking to this guy, a scientist,
2303000	2307000	and he works just about my age, a little younger, actually.
2307000	2311000	No, he works about my age, and he flies spaceships and stuff.
2311000	2312000	It's very cool.
2312000	2314000	I said, were you there when the camera's turned on?
2314000	2316000	He doesn't fly spaceships.
2316000	2317000	He does.
2317000	2318000	I can't say which one.
2318000	2319000	I don't want to get him in trouble.
2319000	2320000	What?
2320000	2322000	He gets in trouble if they tell him what spaceship he flies?
2322000	2324000	What is this, Battlestar Galactica?
2324000	2326000	They're Cylons?
2326000	2328000	This is not an exaggeration.
2328000	2330000	This is not yellow journalism here.
2330000	2333000	I was walking through the thing, and there's all these pictures
2333000	2338000	from Spirit and Opportunity, the two rovers, right?
2338000	2340000	What do you mean he controls spaceships?
2340000	2341000	Yeah, yeah.
2341000	2345000	He sends math that flies probes and things around.
2345000	2347000	I think he was like Starbuck or something.
2347000	2348000	No, no, no.
2348000	2349000	He didn't sit in them.
2349000	2350000	We fly them.
2350000	2351000	Sorry.
2351000	2352000	I was raised in the 70s.
2352000	2355000	Yeah, we fly them remotely, these things.
2355000	2358000	Maybe one day there'll actually be people on Mars.
2358000	2362000	Because of what I think was going on in this conversation,
2362000	2367000	I said, so when you were there, and when the cameras turned on,
2367000	2369000	the first images were beamed back to Earth,
2369000	2371000	and you didn't know if the thing was going to work,
2371000	2373000	but you guys are all scientists.
2373000	2376000	You guys watch sci-fi movies.
2376000	2379000	You're clearly all sci-fi enthusiasts.
2379000	2381000	When that camera turned on, weren't you all kind of holding
2381000	2383000	hands and thinking, what if we just saw a footprint,
2383000	2387000	or a guy running by, or a Snickers wrapper, or some stuff?
2387000	2390000	You don't know what you're going to see up there.
2390000	2393000	He goes, yeah, I'd be lying if I said that wasn't the case.
2393000	2396000	I said, so what did you see?
2396000	2399000	His eyebrows went up, and he just kind of blushed a little bit.
2399000	2401000	I go, did you see something cool?
2401000	2405000	He's like, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
2405000	2406000	He got kind of weird.
2406000	2408000	I go, what did you see?
2409000	2412000	He's like, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
2412000	2415000	He shook his head no, did the throat cut thing,
2415000	2417000	and pointed at the ceiling.
2417000	2419000	I'm like, what's in the ceiling?
2419000	2422000	He's like, there's microphones.
2422000	2424000	They're listening to us right now.
2424000	2427000	I'm like, what did you fucking see?
2427000	2429000	And he's like, stop it.
2429000	2430000	Stop it.
2430000	2431000	Can we go outside?
2431000	2432000	Just stop it.
2432000	2433000	Stop it.
2433000	2434000	There's a little place next to the dumpster
2434000	2436000	where they smoke cigarettes, and there's no cameras.
2437000	2441000	So anyways, when the Martian dick goes in your soup, we.
2441000	2443000	It's like men in black.
2443000	2444000	Did you see a tree?
2444000	2447000	Did you find diamonds?
2447000	2449000	What the fuck is going on up there?
2449000	2452000	And he was real bummed out, and he walked away from me,
2452000	2454000	and his face had turned like plaid.
2454000	2456000	He was so, he was like really bummed out
2456000	2457000	and nervous about some shit.
2457000	2458000	He's like, I can lose my job.
2458000	2460000	I can't talk about these missions.
2460000	2462000	I was like, oh, fucking hell.
2462000	2464000	So he walked outside, and I'm like,
2464000	2465000	my friend Jerry that took me, he's like,
2465000	2467000	dude, what did you say to so-and-so?
2467000	2470000	I'm like, he was the guy that blew it.
2470000	2472000	And he's like, yeah, he's all bummed out.
2472000	2474000	He really wants you to stop talking about that.
2477000	2479000	So then we go to this building, and we see this thing,
2479000	2480000	and they're building a giant Prius
2480000	2483000	with a huge backhoe shovel on it.
2483000	2484000	They're going fucking digging.
2484000	2485000	They're going digging.
2485000	2487000	I agree with that.
2487000	2489000	If you send up a little thing with a little brush on it,
2489000	2491000	and then the next thing you send is a shovel,
2491000	2492000	I do brush something.
2492000	2495000	I don't think they found little people.
2495000	2498000	I don't think they found a subterranean colony.
2498000	2500000	What race would they be?
2500000	2501000	Martians.
2501000	2502000	I'm sorry.
2502000	2503000	I'm obsessed with race.
2503000	2507000	I don't mean to bore you assholes.
2507000	2512000	I don't want to interrupt your fucking radio lab.
2512000	2515000	But I think it's fucking interesting that, where are we?
2515000	2517000	Anyways.
2517000	2519000	You told me that you thought I was being conspiratorial
2519000	2520000	and overly imaginative.
2520000	2522000	I don't think they found...
2522000	2523000	Here's what I think.
2523000	2525000	I think there's ice under the surface
2525000	2527000	that they have to actually really dig for,
2527000	2528000	because I think they found that.
2528000	2529000	And I think they're going to find,
2529000	2531000	what I'm hoping they find,
2531000	2534000	is evidence of microbial life or something like that,
2534000	2537000	where some kind of life maybe still exists,
2537000	2539000	or at least at one point did.
2539000	2541000	Because it wouldn't be life as we know it,
2541000	2542000	because the atmosphere is so low,
2542000	2544000	it would be irradiated and stuff like that.
2544000	2545000	I think they're going to go up there
2545000	2549000	and maybe find out that we're not the only right,
2549000	2550000	spinning around in the sky.
2550000	2553000	It's just as important to get that American flag on the moon,
2553000	2557000	having an American shuttle come back with a rock
2557000	2559000	that has a little fossil of a little amoeba
2559000	2562000	that's basically going to look the same as an Earth amoeba,
2562000	2565000	but it was on Mars 17 billion years ago.
2565000	2566000	That's a big deal.
2566000	2567000	It'll forever be.
2567000	2569000	It's like hegemony.
2569000	2570000	But it would be cool, though,
2570000	2571000	if they went back and we found out,
2571000	2572000	because we don't know what's up there.
2572000	2575000	What if there was a little tiny underground people?
2575000	2577000	Tiny underground people!
2577000	2581000	And they see this giant retro rocket thing coming down
2581000	2584000	at the size of the Empire State Building, as far as they are.
2584000	2586000	How amazing would that be?
2586000	2589000	You broke up with your girlfriend.
2589000	2593000	Verizon's trading on the NASDAQ.
2593000	2596000	People are shooting people left and right,
2596000	2598000	and everything's going right and wrong,
2598000	2600000	and countries are, whoa, China's dollars above the euro
2600000	2601000	and all this stuff.
2601000	2604000	And then they just dig a thing, and there's little people on Mars,
2604000	2608000	just little dudes in line class like Kevin Pollack and Willow.
2608000	2610000	Oh, hello!
2610000	2612000	Ah, I live on Mars!
2612000	2613000	Ah, hello!
2613000	2616000	Come inside, have a cup of Martian juice!
2616000	2617000	And that's why the first...
2617000	2619000	Everything's just like, fuck it.
2619000	2622000	Like every guy on every New York stoop
2622000	2625000	dropping a girl off after dinner is like,
2625000	2626000	oh, can I have a kiss?
2626000	2629000	And she's like, I don't know, I'm not committed.
2629000	2630000	It's like, fuck it, life on Mars!
2630000	2632000	Mwah! Mwah!
2632000	2634000	Like, just everything changes.
2634000	2637000	That one, was it spirit or opportunity, the one that broke down up there?
2637000	2641000	I want to find out that it got Gulliver traveled like that.
2641000	2644000	They tied it down, and they're like, what are these things?
2644000	2647000	And then like, we keep sending these robots up,
2647000	2648000	and then we find diamonds.
2648000	2652000	The reason we're going back there is they found a big diamond mine there,
2652000	2655000	and then we're just going to send these little robot prospectors up there,
2655000	2658000	and they're all going to be alone, they're all going to have beards after a while.
2658000	2660000	Everything turns into dead wood up there.
2660000	2663000	Because they found basically, what's an 8,000 pounds of diamonds?
2663000	2667000	Because it takes like $7 billion to ship them back and forth.
2667000	2671000	But in the end, you make $1,100,
2671000	2674000	and that's more money than NASA's made ever.
2674000	2677000	So everything becomes fucking dead wood up there.
2677000	2680000	There's robot whorehouses and stuff like that.
2680000	2683000	Elsewhere, you cocksucker!
2683000	2685000	I love that they grow beards automatically.
2685000	2689000	The robots just have beards because you need to.
2689000	2693000	One beard is insane like Humphrey Bogart from Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
2693000	2697000	All right, well this is the closest we've come to having a thematic show on Confessions.
2697000	2699000	That was just a random burst of technology.
2699000	2703000	If you're listening at home, edit it yourself.
2703000	2706000	We talked about Mars.
2706000	2710000	But I want to talk like, people are so good.
2710000	2715000	If you go down a line of people, I'm convinced, and I'm not pandering,
2715000	2719000	I think that Harmon Town audiences are the best audiences in the world,
2719000	2722000	in the history of anything.
2722000	2727000	For those of you listening, I'm not prompting them to say that, to do that.
2727000	2732000	I walked down the line and I'm pushing the envelope of what we can ask of them.
2732000	2736000	I said, because we ask them, ask us questions about your job and all this stuff.
2736000	2739000	This week I said, write down a confession.
2739000	2743000	I want to try to think of a confession just to get the ball rolling.
2743000	2746000	Hardwick came up, he's very gracious.
2746000	2749000	Because we need to be clear, we need to trust each other.
2749000	2754000	I don't know if we've proven since we started podcasting that Harmon Town is a safe place for human beings.
2754000	2760000	If you've done something that you're ashamed of, and you're sorry about it,
2760000	2763000	maybe that should be resolvable.
2763000	2766000	I'm trying to think of something I'm really embarrassed about.
2766000	2771000	Jeff and I were talking about just lies that we told teachers and stuff like that.
2771000	2773000	We were pretty criminal minded kids.
2773000	2775000	I was a really bad person.
2775000	2779000	I think when you're up to the age of 18, you're really a sociopath automatically.
2779000	2783000	Everyone teaches you when you're young because they're so scared of you.
2783000	2786000	When you're 18, the secret is you can do whatever the fuck you want.
2786000	2788000	You can beat anyone up.
2788000	2791000	Think about it, we draft them into our armies.
2791000	2795000	When you're 18, that's when you're old enough to hold a gun
2795000	2799000	and charge at another nation's 18-year-olds.
2799000	2804000	If they're scared of 18-year-olds, we wouldn't use them to kill people.
2804000	2806000	We found a place to hide them.
2806000	2810000	Because we're scared of them, we tell them very, very clearly,
2810000	2813000	you need to keep it cool, brother.
2813000	2818000	Your reward awaits you later if you learn how to act properly.
2818000	2826000	I do think that young people, not because human beings are bad when they're younger,
2826000	2830000	but because we put so much emphasis on training,
2830000	2836000	young people are sociopaths because what they learn for the first 18 years of their life
2836000	2840000	is that the reason not to do things is that you'll get caught and you'll get in trouble.
2840000	2842000	There's no emphasis.
2842000	2846000	You have to kind of self-learn, and I think only 15% of us do learn later,
2846000	2850000	oh, I shouldn't do that because I'd be an asshole.
2850000	2853000	Most people spend their lives going,
2853000	2856000	oh, I wish I could do that, but I'd get caught.
2856000	2860000	That's why we're fascinated with mafia movies and serial killers and stuff like that,
2860000	2862000	because we're like, ew, what if I could?
2862000	2865000	You all have it within you, and hopefully we captured some.
2865000	2867000	I want to hear the dark stuff.
2867000	2868000	There's some dark ones in here.
2868000	2870000	I mean, there's some goodies.
2870000	2872000	I don't know that I could absolve you of it, okay?
2872000	2874000	I mean, but could a priest ever?
2874000	2875000	Could anybody ever?
2875000	2876000	Can you ever?
2876000	2877000	Could a therapist ever?
2877000	2884000	But also, hearing it anonymously, maybe you might save somebody else here tonight.
2884000	2886000	So let's hear a couple of highlights.
2886000	2887000	It's hard to think.
2887000	2889000	And we'll comment or not, but maybe we can barrel through a bunch.
2889000	2890000	Right, okay.
2890000	2892000	Like a fireworks display.
2892000	2893000	What if they just pop off?
2893000	2894000	All of you are in this room.
2894000	2896000	I want to save that one because it's about race.
2896000	2898000	I'm going to save that one.
2898000	2900000	Okay, somebody writes.
2900000	2903000	My first attempt at sex was my first kiss.
2903000	2906000	It didn't work because I didn't know female anatomy
2906000	2909000	and was just pushing my boner into her pubes.
2913000	2915000	Okay, that's not a crime.
2915000	2917000	That's called every guy.
2917000	2918000	That's just like Marco Polo saying.
2918000	2920000	I thought Chinese people were wearing lanterns.
2920000	2921000	I didn't know.
2921000	2922000	He didn't know.
2922000	2923000	That's how I still do it.
2923000	2924000	Yeah.
2924000	2928000	Actually, if you keep doing that long enough, it'll work, so.
2928000	2930000	All right.
2930000	2932000	That's basically how it works.
2932000	2933000	Let's see.
2933000	2935000	I don't really like my sister.
2939000	2943000	You're already absolved because the fact that that's a confession means
2943000	2946000	you pretend you do, and that's your job as a brother.
2947000	2948000	That's the best you can do.
2948000	2951000	I ended a four-year relationship via email.
2954000	2956000	Yeah, the crowd has spoken on that.
2957000	2959000	I can't.
2959000	2962000	This is why I didn't want to do questions because I'm not good at answering them.
2962000	2964000	I'm not a life master.
2964000	2968000	I would say don't try to give advice so much as just put yourself in their shoes.
2970000	2973000	For instance, ran over the neighbor's cat and didn't care.
2973000	2974000	Hate cats.
2977000	2978000	All right.
2978000	2979000	Now we're getting deeper, actually.
2979000	2980000	That's amazing.
2980000	2981000	Yeah.
2981000	2983000	We got some haymakers in here.
2983000	2986000	This is a good confession because they don't bother to say they're not
2986000	2987000	expressing remorse.
2987000	2992000	Some of these you can go, oh, you confessed it so problem solved.
2993000	2994000	This person still hates cats.
2994000	2995000	Yeah.
2995000	2996000	Unrepentant.
2996000	2997000	It feels bad.
2997000	2999000	Like a serial killer saying, put a rubber band around my nuts.
2999000	3001000	I will kill again.
3002000	3003000	And they do that.
3003000	3004000	Like rapists and stuff.
3004000	3005000	They go, castrate me.
3005000	3009000	I'm begging you because that's tough.
3009000	3010000	Thank you.
3011000	3016000	I wish I hadn't pushed my cousin down the hill in a dog crate.
3019000	3023000	That just sounds like a story and ended in a terrible mishap.
3024000	3026000	You won't have the chance to do that again.
3026000	3027000	You're fine.
3029000	3030000	Here's a goodie.
3031000	3032000	Here's a goodie.
3032000	3034000	Pretty sure I have an STD.
3036000	3037000	Parentheses.
3038000	3039000	Tame one.
3039000	3040000	No symptoms.
3040000	3044000	But haven't told my past partners and probably won't tell my current one.
3044000	3045000	How do you?
3048000	3049000	All right.
3049000	3050000	Well, yeah.
3051000	3053000	In an email, says the young lady in the front row.
3054000	3055000	In an email.
3055000	3057000	Well, should we stop and talk about that?
3057000	3058000	Yeah.
3058000	3059000	I don't know.
3059000	3060000	We're not Dr. Drew.
3060000	3061000	We didn't.
3062000	3064000	But it's like that guy ran over a cat.
3064000	3065000	He doesn't give a shit.
3065000	3067000	Pretty sure I have an STD.
3067000	3068000	A tame one.
3068000	3070000	He means not AIDS.
3070000	3071000	Not AIDS.
3071000	3072000	But he doesn't not mean.
3072000	3074000	But he says no symptoms.
3074000	3075000	He means herpes.
3075000	3076000	He means herpes?
3076000	3077000	I think.
3077000	3079000	If you have herpes, you have symptoms.
3079000	3080000	You know it.
3080000	3081000	No, not necessarily.
3081000	3082000	That's a big problem.
3082000	3084000	That's why one out of three people in this room have herpes.
3084000	3086000	Is it because guys are dipshits?
3086000	3087000	Why are you raising your hand?
3088000	3091000	I'm saying it's a he only based on the handwriting, but that could be wrong.
3091000	3093000	I feel like this is a guy.
3093000	3094000	But it's guys.
3094000	3097000	Guys don't show as much symptomatically.
3097000	3101000	So guys, I'm just saying to you, if you're 19 years old, you're here, you're coming to
3101000	3102000	Harbin Town.
3102000	3103000	This is just good advice.
3103000	3104000	Whatever.
3104000	3105000	Aside from this guy.
3105000	3109000	I'm just saying like herpes is like it's a little bit of an epidemic.
3109000	3113000	And it's partially because guys carry it around and you need to get checked and stuff.
3113000	3114000	That's all.
3114000	3115000	That's my Dr. Drew segment.
3115000	3116000	It's funny.
3116000	3117000	You said that.
3117000	3118000	How do you tell somebody?
3118000	3120000	And she in the front row said via email.
3120000	3128000	This written confession ends with a frowny face emoticon.
3128000	3130000	I think you're probably right about that.
3130000	3131000	Yeah.
3131000	3132000	I don't know.
3132000	3133000	What do we say to that guy?
3133000	3134000	We say you got it.
3134000	3135000	You got to tell.
3135000	3136000	First of all, you do.
3136000	3138000	You just tell your current partner because every time you put your dick in her, you're
3138000	3140000	putting a gun to her head and playing Russia.
3140000	3141000	It's not.
3141000	3142000	You have to take your medicine.
3142000	3147760	The guy that ran over his cat who's confessing that he doesn't give a fuck about whether
3148760	3149760	cats live or die.
3149760	3151760	He probably has AIDS.
3151760	3156760	He doesn't own a veterinarian hospital.
3156760	3162760	As a person who's having sex with women constantly, you hate cats and you own a veterinarian hospital.
3162760	3167760	So you need to put a little sign on your thing that says also may have herpes.
3167760	3170760	You got to talk to the girl.
3170760	3174760	Well, here's a better solution.
3174760	3178760	Have her give you hand jobs until you get checked.
3178760	3179760	I tried.
3179760	3180760	I tried.
3180760	3182760	I tried to make it easy for him.
3182760	3183760	I don't know.
3183760	3184760	I'm trying.
3184760	3185760	That's a toughy, man.
3185760	3188760	You got to go get fucking get checked and get up to.
3188760	3189760	Also herpes is hard to.
3189760	3192760	But he admits or let's just say he.
3192760	3195760	I actually I just injected herpes.
3195760	3197760	I just assumed that I created that.
3197760	3198760	Yeah.
3198760	3199760	He didn't say herpes.
3199760	3202760	If it's chlamydia, go to Planned Parenthood, take a pill.
3202760	3203760	It's gone.
3203760	3204760	That's the end of it.
3204760	3205760	Not that anyone was asking for advice.
3205760	3206760	You were confessing stuff.
3206760	3209760	But sometimes when someone says, my dick has a tick on it.
3209760	3210760	What should I do with it?
3210760	3214760	Well, stop sticking it in, people.
3214760	3218760	Because you're not pretending to give advice here necessarily.
3218760	3220760	This is about getting things off our chest.
3220760	3223760	But when you go to a therapist and you go, well, my parents hit me.
3223760	3225760	That's why I think I'm a shitty writer.
3225760	3227760	The first thing they say is, are they still hitting you?
3227760	3228760	No, I'm 39.
3228760	3229760	And they go, I know.
3229760	3232760	I just have to ask.
3232760	3235760	We're also presuming that people want to be anonymous about these.
3235760	3238760	If any of you, if I read one of yours and you want to talk about it,
3238760	3242760	you want to talk it out, then a herpes dick doesn't want to talk to anybody.
3242760	3246760	What about this one who writes, I've never tasted my own cum.
3246760	3248760	Stand up.
3248760	3250760	Anybody?
3250760	3251760	Never tasted your own cum?
3251760	3252760	Rob, I know it's not you.
3252760	3254760	That's not a confession.
3254760	3255760	It's not you.
3255760	3256760	It's not you.
3256760	3257760	All right.
3257760	3259760	No, that's a confession.
3259760	3260760	They wrote it down.
3260760	3263760	It tastes like salt water.
3263760	3264760	Salt water?
3264760	3265760	Yeah, it tastes like salt water.
3265760	3268760	What do you mean, what the hell?
3268760	3270760	It tastes like, what do you think it tastes like?
3270760	3273760	No, mine tastes like root beer.
3273760	3279760	It smells like paper mache, but I feel like it tastes like salt water.
3279760	3282760	I feel like this is dangerous, but I'm going to read it anyway.
3282760	3285760	I regret being racist at the age of five.
3285760	3288760	After a black girl ate my purple crayon,
3288760	3291760	I had to be convinced by my mom that, quote,
3291760	3294760	not all black kids eat crayons.
3300760	3301760	Well, I will say if you're...
3301760	3304760	Which is why we're going to Mars to solve this.
3304760	3307760	I will say if you're going to be racist,
3307760	3309760	that's probably the best stereotype.
3309760	3311760	Keep it high concept.
3311760	3312760	Yeah.
3312760	3314760	And they're just muppets.
3314760	3318760	Hey, keep your purple crayons away from those people.
3318760	3319760	Well, again, this is another one.
3319760	3321760	These are adorable confessions.
3321760	3323760	So far the cat and the driveway guy
3323760	3325760	and the herpes dick or herpes titty,
3325760	3329760	we don't know who this person was.
3329760	3332760	I hate to fan the flames.
3332760	3336760	I one time told my Asian friend to open her eyes
3336760	3340760	only to realize they were already open.
3340760	3344760	I was like, is it Andrew Dice Clay in the audience?
3344760	3345760	Bobby Slaton?
3345760	3346760	No.
3346760	3348760	If that really happened, then you were probably a kid
3348760	3349760	and whatever.
3349760	3352760	Little kids are fascinated with each other's differences
3352760	3354760	and things.
3354760	3355760	You touch each other's hair.
3355760	3356760	You touch each other.
3356760	3357760	You look at it and you go,
3357760	3359760	oh, why are your fingers different and all this stuff?
3359760	3362760	But it doesn't really register on the level that we perceive.
3362760	3364760	Race is an artificial construct.
3364760	3365760	People go, oh, you have freckles.
3365760	3366760	You have red hair.
3366760	3367760	You're taller than me.
3367760	3368760	You're shorter than me.
3368760	3369760	All that stuff.
3369760	3373760	What we call race blends into that shit until our parents get involved,
3373760	3376760	and it's passed down from their parents.
3376760	3379760	Anyways, the obsession is trickling out.
3379760	3381760	I am 39 years old.
3381760	3383760	I'm talking to a bunch of 25-year-olds.
3383760	3386760	You guys are already bored with me being obsessed with race,
3386760	3387760	which is great.
3387760	3388760	It's eroding away.
3388760	3389760	I like it.
3389760	3393760	If I walk into a playground these days
3393760	3395760	and look at these kids playing with each other,
3395760	3398760	it's different now because some kids are different now.
3398760	3400760	In other words, some have different abilities.
3400760	3402760	Some maybe are better looking than others.
3402760	3404760	Maybe some get higher grades.
3404760	3409760	Why are you going around playgrounds looking for better-looking kids?
3409760	3412760	I'll tell you why.
3412760	3416760	Because I will fuck a kid.
3416760	3417760	That's my confession.
3417760	3419760	That's a confession.
3419760	3422760	Especially if he says he'll do it again.
3422760	3426760	They're just smooth.
3426760	3428760	Smooth.
3428760	3430760	Delicious.
3430760	3433760	This is not a confession.
3433760	3434760	Maybe it is.
3434760	3435760	I don't know.
3435760	3439760	When I was 12, I was on a Highway to Heaven episode.
3439760	3442760	For those of you who don't know, thank you, Rob.
3442760	3445760	Thank you for one person that's 40 in here.
3445760	3447760	There's a TV show with Michael Landon where he played an angel
3447760	3450760	and came down to earth to solve people's little problems
3450760	3451760	from their little work a day.
3451760	3452760	He helped him out.
3452760	3454760	He was like the Hulk, but without turning into the Hulk.
3455760	3459760	Yeah, they got less rope belts and less flipped over cars.
3459760	3462760	But I played a kid that went to college too young
3462760	3465760	and was being bossed around by my football playing roommate
3465760	3468760	who was using me to steal computer,
3468760	3471760	the answers to tests and things like that.
3471760	3477760	So I turned 32 or 3 maybe,
3477760	3480760	and I'm at my computer and somebody sends me a link to something
3480760	3482760	and they're like, hey, check it out.
3482760	3485760	It's all these screen captures of me when I was 12
3485760	3486760	on Highway to Heaven,
3486760	3489760	but it's all the pictures of me with my shirt off.
3489760	3491760	I'm like, I didn't put that together.
3491760	3494760	It's like, wow, there's all these pictures of me on this TV show.
3494760	3496760	I'll save that image, save that image.
3496760	3499760	I look up at the URL at the top of the thing and I'm like,
3499760	3502760	I'm going to erase all the information of the JPEG
3502760	3505760	and the thing to find out what is this website.
3505760	3508760	Pedophile website.
3508760	3511760	And there's a link to blogs.
3511760	3514760	It's called Forever 14, if I remember correctly.
3514760	3515760	Yeah.
3515760	3521760	Guys, check it out.
3521760	3525760	Search for Jeffrey Brian Davis shirt off.
3525760	3526760	Forever 14, though.
3526760	3530760	Do pedophiles consider themselves young-inated?
3530760	3533760	It's pictures of adult actors when they were young.
3533760	3536760	So there's Corey Feldman and Will Wheaton,
3536760	3539760	and it's all these pictures of actors that were acting when they were young,
3539760	3542760	and it's generally pictures with them in a bathing suit
3542760	3544760	or with their shirt off or wet.
3544760	3547760	It's raining out and the clothes are sticking to them.
3547760	3549760	No matter how old these people get,
3549760	3553760	we will bring them to you in their prime.
3553760	3556760	That's the Forever 14 guarantee.
3556760	3557760	Fucking rough.
3557760	3560760	And you know what, Nike, if you don't fork over some money,
3560760	3563760	we're going to promote Forever14.com
3563760	3566760	and tell them Nike sent it.
3566760	3571760	Start in discount code Nike at Forever14.com
3571760	3576760	unless they give us some money.
3576760	3580760	There's a link to the forum part of it,
3580760	3582760	which is like conversations about it.
3582760	3586760	And they had stopped in like 2002, or I don't know what it was,
3586760	3587760	like 98.
3587760	3589760	They'd stopped years before.
3589760	3592760	Right around your appearance on Jump Street.
3592760	3593760	And your stubble came in.
3593760	3594760	Exactly, yeah.
3594760	3596760	And I had to pass my prime.
3596760	3598760	And there were conversations.
3598760	3601760	And I think you could probably go to jail for any of the things
3601760	3602760	they were saying.
3602760	3604760	Because it was like, hmm, he's like the boy next door.
3604760	3606760	I'd like to have him come over and mow my lawn.
3606760	3608760	I'll teach him a thing or two.
3608760	3610760	And I just felt this hand.
3610760	3612760	I felt the sensation of someone walking up behind you
3612760	3615760	and putting a cold, clammy hand on your shoulder.
3615760	3617760	And I can't imagine what it's like to be a woman.
3617760	3619760	No man possibly could because it's too.
3619760	3622760	Oh, God, because they have a hole where their dick's supposed to be.
3623760	3624760	I'm sorry.
3624760	3626760	Take it easy.
3626760	3628760	Take it easy, Nike.
3628760	3632760	But women walking through a parking structure at night,
3632760	3636760	or getting in an elevator with guys,
3636760	3643760	I felt for a moment, I just felt violated by everything at once.
3643760	3646760	And I felt very vulnerable and crazy.
3646760	3648760	It's just the worst.
3648760	3653760	However, little boys, mmm, mmm, mmm.
3653760	3655760	Yeah, well, OK.
3655760	3658760	All right, so let's barrel through some of these conventions,
3658760	3659760	I think.
3659760	3660760	I don't know.
3660760	3662760	I look at porn on my work computer.
3662760	3664760	Not a confession.
3664760	3670760	If you're getting away with it, you're a hero.
3670760	3677760	I wish I didn't sit through every episode of The Cape.
3677760	3678760	All right.
3678760	3681760	Meanwhile, someone else in the same room,
3681760	3683760	I've never watched Firefly.
3687760	3688760	Hey, you know what?
3688760	3689760	Neither have I.
3691760	3693760	Yeah, drink it in.
3693760	3695760	There's my confession.
3695760	3697760	Meghan Ganz wrote that line in that community episode
3697760	3700760	when Troy and Abba revealed themselves to be Firefly fans.
3700760	3702760	I've never actually seen it.
3702760	3705760	I've never watched Community.
3706760	3711760	This one might be the most revealing and shocking confession
3711760	3714760	of them all, just because in its simplicity.
3714760	3717760	I've heard a lot of people, but I feel worst
3717760	3721760	about not feeling bad about any of it.
3721760	3725760	Well, yeah, that's your sociopath, right?
3725760	3727760	And you know that, and you're afraid of getting caught,
3727760	3729760	and that's the only thing that drives you.
3729760	3732760	What's the most shameful thing you could say?
3732760	3735760	What's something that you would just be like?
3735760	3738760	I think it's closely related to that.
3738760	3740760	I think the most shameful thing I could say
3740760	3744760	is how little I care about other people's lives.
3744760	3747760	I was in the bar tonight, and I saw
3747760	3749760	that there was another fucking shooting.
3749760	3750760	I don't even know.
3750760	3752760	It's like we made comments about it,
3752760	3754760	and we talked politically and psychologically about it.
3754760	3756760	Yeah, Dan and I met before the show,
3756760	3758760	and it's that the shooting in the Sikh temple,
3758760	3760760	was it Wisconsin, was it?
3760760	3763760	Yeah, and it's just hot on the heels of that last asshole
3763760	3765760	in the movie theater.
3765760	3766760	It's my first response, of course.
3766760	3768760	I'm from Wisconsin.
3768760	3773760	I immediately, and then we're talking about media coverage.
3773760	3776760	We're talking about whether or not they should have given
3776760	3779760	so much attention to the Joker guy.
3779760	3781760	It's just me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
3781760	3784760	We didn't, I don't know what we're supposed to do.
3784760	3787760	Get off our bar stools and run out in the street
3787760	3790760	and stop traffic, like in a Spike Lee movie,
3790760	3792760	and say, wake up!
3792760	3794760	Everyone stop!
3794760	3795760	We're humans.
3795760	3800760	But I don't think that other people exist.
3800760	3803760	That is my most shameful confession.
3803760	3807760	I don't, I think that if you started to care
3807760	3811760	that other people existed, you would get absorbed by them
3811760	3813760	and you would never be alive again.
3813760	3815760	But in some way, does that qualify you
3815760	3818760	or disqualify you as someone that creates characters
3818760	3820760	and writes shows about people and for people?
3820760	3823760	I don't, halfway through your question,
3823760	3826760	I started thinking about myself.
3826760	3828760	Halfway through my question,
3828760	3831760	I was thinking about little boys.
3831760	3834760	I don't, I don't know, and I confess that in the hopes
3834760	3837760	that we all go through that, but I've known people
3837760	3840760	like our friend Daniel Gillies, who's on Vampire Diaries,
3840760	3842760	who before he was on Vampire Diaries,
3842760	3845760	heard about Katrina happening and jumped in his car
3845760	3847760	and drove down to Katrina.
3847760	3849760	Yeah, and commandeered a bulldozer
3849760	3851760	because Red Cross wouldn't let him have one
3851760	3853760	because you have to go through all this rigmarole
3853760	3857760	to actually be in a vehicle helping people out.
3857760	3859760	So you went to a neighborhood where nobody was helping,
3859760	3862760	like one of the many neglected neighborhoods,
3862760	3864760	and he just rented one?
3864760	3865760	I forget how he did it.
3865760	3867760	I think he had to steal one because the government was like,
3867760	3868760	you can't help people.
3868760	3869760	You're not allowed to help.
3869760	3871760	Helping people is worth a dollar.
3871760	3874760	You have to go over to the line helping people pen.
3874760	3878760	Future Elijah from Vampire Diaries is just,
3878760	3880760	oh, mate, I've got to clean up this garbage, man.
3880760	3882760	Yeah, he's Australian or Kiwi.
3882760	3883760	Kiwi, yeah.
3883760	3885760	He's not even in his country, and he's like,
3885760	3886760	fucking, people are drowning.
3886760	3888760	He's like, Jeff, Jeff was just watching the TV,
3888760	3891760	and I was like, I can't just sit at home and watch.
3891760	3894760	I'm like, I did.
3894760	3895760	I could.
3895760	3898760	I was like, well, it's flipping back and forth.
3898760	3899760	Fucking, yeah.
3899760	3901760	I was like, whoa, what's Jerry Springer doing?
3901760	3903760	Yeah, that's my shameful confession,
3903760	3905760	is that I'm everything they want me to be.
3905760	3909760	I'm a fucking breastfeeding baby on this tube that comes
3909760	3910760	into your living room.
3910760	3911760	I don't.
3911760	3913760	I have been in.
3913760	3914760	I don't.
3914760	3916760	And that's one of those confessions,
3916760	3919760	like the guy that confessed the cat thing.
3919760	3921760	There were a couple of those where the thing was like,
3921760	3924760	the real cry was like, when you're really confessing it,
3924760	3928760	it's like, and I don't believe that the confession helps.
3928760	3932760	Because otherwise, I would have confessed it a long time ago.
3932760	3938760	A confession is something that you don't want to be true.
3938760	3940760	And we're primates.
3940760	3943760	So if you hide it long enough, it goes away.
3943760	3946760	Cat shits on the carpet, dries, turns into crumbs,
3946760	3947760	blows away in the wind.
3947760	3950760	Take your shitty underwear, put it in the garbage.
3950760	3951760	You never shit your pants.
3951760	3953760	We forgot.
3953760	3954760	You play with matches.
3954760	3955760	Mom doesn't catch you.
3955760	3957760	It never happened.
3957760	3959760	You murder somebody, and the body goes away.
3959760	3961760	You're not guilty.
3961760	3964760	But so confession is over.
3964760	3965760	Here's the thing about confession.
3965760	3966760	No fucking resolution.
3966760	3968760	That's the thing, OK?
3968760	3969760	Maybe that's how we slipped.
3969760	3970760	I'm just stumbling into this.
3970760	3972760	I took world history in 10th grade.
3972760	3977760	The Catholic Church invented this concept of they would sell you absolution.
3977760	3979760	Like they put a dollar value on it.
3979760	3981760	That would be my next step, as I would say.
3981760	3982760	Write it down on the slip of paper.
3982760	3983760	We'll read it out loud.
3983760	3984760	Tell it to me or me alone.
3984760	3986760	Give me a dollar.
3986760	3987760	Now it's done.
3987760	3988760	Now it's over.
3988760	3989760	Now you didn't do it.
3989760	3991760	Maybe that's not how confession works.
3991760	3992760	Maybe confession just needs to happen.
3992760	3993760	You just bubble it up.
3993760	3997760	It just becomes a froth, like a zit on your face.
3997760	3999760	Black head turns into a white head.
3999760	4000760	Maybe it stays painful.
4000760	4002760	Maybe it festers.
4002760	4005760	But maybe honesty stays the best policy.
4005760	4009760	We confess stuff that doesn't lead to us not having done stuff.
4009760	4011760	I'm still a shitty person.
4011760	4013760	I shared it with you, though.
4013760	4015760	It goes to the front of my brain.
4015760	4016760	I don't know.
4016760	4017760	So that's it.
4017760	4021760	So now we move on to because this is important.
4021760	4022760	I'm making this commitment.
4022760	4026760	We got the harmontown.com website going up.
4026760	4031760	I'm going to put on the harmontown.com sometime between now and the next show.
4031760	4037760	I have to make sure that Jeff and I have rolled first level Dungeons & Dragons characters.
4037760	4040760	Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters.
4040760	4044760	I guess I have to specify first edition.
4044760	4045760	Well, okay.
4045760	4046760	Whoa, whoa.
4046760	4047760	Okay.
4047760	4048760	Sorry, buddy.
4048760	4052760	Somebody cried out in pain like a wolf trapped in a little...
4052760	4054760	The saddest confession of all.
4054760	4055760	Well, okay.
4055760	4056760	All right.
4056760	4062760	Well, see, that already gets complicated because I grew up on just A, D, and D with the old-school
4062760	4063760	stuff.
4063760	4064760	I don't know.
4064760	4066760	So is anybody here...
4066760	4069760	Is somebody here like a Dungeons & Dragons kind of aficionado?
4069760	4070760	All right.
4070760	4071760	First-hand a shoot-up.
4071760	4073760	Are you willing to come up here for just a second?
4073760	4074760	All right.
4074760	4075760	Just to answer some questions.
4075760	4076760	It doesn't...
4076760	4078760	Let's welcome them to the stage.
4078760	4080760	You all be...
4080760	4084760	What is your name?
4084760	4085760	Spencer.
4085760	4086760	Spencer, everybody.
4086760	4087760	All right.
4087760	4088760	That's already a good...
4088760	4094760	I got to admit, A, D, and D is a bit before my time, but I...
4094760	4096760	I get it.
4096760	4097760	I get it.
4097760	4098760	I've read the books.
4098760	4099760	I just haven't played it too much.
4099760	4100760	Well, that's why I called you up.
4100760	4103760	Because what has happened since 89?
4103760	4106760	Like, I...
4106760	4110760	Well, 9-11 happened.
4110760	4116760	Well, I didn't care.
4116760	4117760	I just...
4117760	4118760	How many...
4118760	4120760	What edition of Dungeons & Dragons are we on?
4120760	4122760	I think there's, like, fourth edition right now.
4122760	4123760	Jesus Christ.
4123760	4125760	Is it better than third?
4125760	4127760	Has it been getting better?
4127760	4129760	Third edition's probably better.
4129760	4130760	Fourth edition's too easy.
4130760	4131760	Does that make anyone angry in here?
4131760	4133760	It's really done down.
4133760	4136760	Third edition's better than fourth?
4136760	4137760	Yeah.
4137760	4138760	Okay.
4138760	4139760	I'm willing to take that as a quorum.
4139760	4140760	Thank you so much.
4140760	4141760	All right.
4141760	4150760	Spencer, would you be willing to generate first-level characters for Jeff Davis and me so that...
4150760	4152760	And then we'll put them on the line.
4152760	4154760	So sometime talk to us after the show.
4154760	4155760	Yeah, no problem.
4155760	4157760	So we'll arrange you being able to upload them.
4157760	4159760	Have you been a Dungeon Master before?
4159760	4160760	Yeah.
4160760	4161760	I was, like, before I was coming here.
4161760	4162760	Hey, take it easy.
4162760	4163760	Take it easy.
4163760	4164760	He was...
4164760	4166760	We haven't started yet.
4166760	4168760	I'll cast a magic missile.
4168760	4170760	I don't even know what that is.
4170760	4171760	Awesome.
4171760	4172760	So you've done it before?
4172760	4173760	Yeah, no.
4173760	4174760	I was just writing some stuff today, actually.
4174760	4175760	Fucking yes.
4175760	4177760	Hey, don't give him the fucking job.
4177760	4178760	No.
4178760	4179760	I'm saying...
4179760	4180760	I just need an audition.
4180760	4181760	Yeah.
4181760	4182760	We lucked out.
4182760	4183760	You'll get an audition for sure.
4183760	4185760	Who better to start with?
4185760	4187760	We'll inaugurate this new segment.
4187760	4188760	We need characters.
4188760	4190760	Now, what is the end game?
4190760	4193760	We're going to try to find somebody that we actually want.
4193760	4195760	We'll try out, like, a handful of people.
4195760	4198760	Yeah, we'll play, like, 15-minute segments with them.
4198760	4201760	It's not that fair, but either is American Idol.
4201760	4205760	I mean, Radiohead wouldn't win American Idol.
4205760	4207760	You need to listen to a whole album before you realize they're worth it.
4207760	4210760	And then we'll start playing D&D.
4210760	4213760	Are you going to be Mitch Nightblade or whatever your name was?
4222760	4224760	I was close, wasn't I?
4224760	4230760	Spencer, if you could do us the honor of picking the race and class of the characters,
4230760	4232760	you don't have to name them.
4232760	4233760	We'll name them.
4233760	4234760	OK.
4234760	4237760	Rob Schraub is having a hard attack in the audience.
4237760	4243760	So then part of our show next week is maybe you'll present the characters next week?
4243760	4246760	I have no idea what's going on. I'm all for it.
4246760	4248760	I know I'm going to win.
4248760	4252760	Come to next week's Harmon Town with your satchels and your dice.
4252760	4256760	I have a feeling there's a lot of Dungeon Masters out there in Los Angeles,
4256760	4260760	and I think all of them listen to his podcast.
4260760	4262760	Yes, we do.
4264760	4266760	I know all of them.
4266760	4268760	Thank you, Spencer, for...
4268760	4269760	Spencer, everyone.
4269760	4271760	I trust Spencer.
4273760	4276760	I trust Spencer to say Third Edition is the way to go.
4276760	4277760	I don't know, man.
4277760	4281760	When I was a kid, there were no auditions.
4281760	4286760	My Dungeon Masters guide had melted wax on the inside cover
4286760	4289760	and just all kinds of notes and maps
4289760	4292760	because everyone felt like you were this close to worshipping the devil.
4292760	4294760	It was punk rock. It was cool.
4296760	4298760	All you people care about is fucking inception.
4298760	4300760	That's all you care about.
4300760	4302760	That's your Dungeons and Dragons.
4302760	4303760	Because if you think about it...
4303760	4308760	No, if you think about it, a troll could be a paladin.
4308760	4310760	That's mind-blowing.
4310760	4314760	A dream in a dream that a six-year-old could say that.
4316760	4317760	We're running way late.
4317760	4319760	I've never played Dungeons and Dragons.
4319760	4322760	We had won a board of attempts to try to play it as adults,
4322760	4323760	and it failed miserably.
4323760	4325760	Because I was the Dungeon Master. I'm the worst.
4325760	4327760	It worked. We didn't like it.
4327760	4333760	Also, I went out and played crappy pitch-and-putt golf with Matt Gorley yesterday,
4333760	4335760	and we invited you, but you were playing Minecraft,
4335760	4338760	which I'd also done. I don't see the allure of it.
4338760	4340760	It's the best. I can't explain that now.
4340760	4342760	You're talking about another three-hour podcast.
4342760	4344760	Thank you, sir. Thank you.
4344760	4347760	Minecraft. 1.31 update.
4347760	4350760	Was that close? Was it Mitch Nightblade or something?
4350760	4352760	Jim Nightblade.
4353760	4355760	All right. We will see you next week.
4355760	4357760	We're going to get this settled.
4357760	4359760	Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.
4359760	4360760	You guys have been tremendous.
4360760	4362760	Thank you for coming.
4363760	4365760	Do you get the people to thank?
4365760	4367760	I can find it.
4368760	4371760	Let's pull them up. I should have had that up.
4371760	4373760	I can find it right now, the thank yous.
4373760	4375760	Hold up.
4375760	4377760	Keep it down, Olivia Newton-John.
4377760	4379760	All right. Thanks once again, everybody.
4379760	4381760	We want to thank Katie Levine for audio recording.
4381760	4384760	Zach McKeeper, our tech. Emily Gordon,
4384760	4385760	producing the live show.
4385760	4387760	Danielle Kramer, program director.
4387760	4389760	Dustal Marshall, podcast producer.
4389760	4391760	Mo Fathlebab, on-site director.
4391760	4393760	And Jenny Fine are a fantastic artiste.
4393760	4395760	Thank you so much for coming to Nerd Milk.
4395760	4398760	Also, thank you for listening out there in podcast land.
4398760	4400760	Go and prosper. Thank you so much.
4400760	4402760	Thank you.
