0	14440	I'm spending all my money and it's going up my nose.
14440	15440	You guys got the rhythm.
15440	19280	My daddy's got me out and he's tearing up my clothes.
19280	25400	Welcome once again to Knelt Down Comics in Hollywood, California.
25400	27240	Harman Town is now in session.
27240	34240	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
34240	45000	Alright, let's get this over with.
45000	52120	I've been Minecrafting for two days and I'm in the middle of a big skyscraper and I'm
52120	54240	trying to get my item ducts working.
54240	56240	I'll tell you about it later.
56240	57240	What are you talking about last night?
57240	58240	Chicken chuggers?
58240	60120	What was it?
60120	67320	Spencer was recommending, because in Minecraft the world is infinitely procedurally generated
67320	71640	as you go anywhere and everything that is created stays where it is.
71640	74400	However, things don't stay active.
74400	80240	Like if you're cooking something in a little grill and you walk too far away from it, it'll
80240	84400	just kind of stop cooking on the grill, but the grill will still be there and the thing
84400	89840	will still be on the grill unless you get, unless you build what's called a chunk loader
89840	93240	because everything's in chunks, the data is in all in chunks.
93240	96840	So Spencer was recommending I get a thing called chicken chunks.
96840	97840	Okay.
97840	98840	Alright.
98840	102920	This is the most ill-advised way to open a show.
102920	103920	Should I start playing this game?
103920	104920	Is it that good?
104920	105920	Oh god, it's the best.
105920	106920	Are you kidding?
106920	107920	Well, my applause.
107920	108920	Who plays this game here?
108920	114360	It's not even a game, it's like, it's like, it's like knitting, you know?
115360	120560	Remember when we both had pirated copies of Maya and we would just send a little things
120560	121560	back and forth?
121560	122560	Yeah.
122560	127400	You would make like a sphere with some nipples on it and then you'd email me the file and
127400	134360	then I'd open it up and I'd extrude the nipples and loft them into a nerve surface.
134360	137040	No, it's fun.
137040	138040	It's like a hobby.
138040	141600	It's not really a game because you're not like, there's no score and you're not trying
141600	142600	to kill anybody.
142600	143600	Right.
144360	145360	It's like playing Legos.
145360	148480	So the sense of achievement is from moment to moment.
148480	150000	Yeah, just making stuff.
150000	151000	Just go.
151000	154560	That's what, you get a multiplayer server and then you can go, you know, you sit there
154560	158280	by yourself most of the time forever, even if your friend's on there, but then sometimes
158280	164600	you maybe jet pack over to your friend's location and look at what they're making and, you know,
164600	166600	you know, just, okay.
166600	168440	Alright.
168440	169440	Maybe I'll take up knitting.
169440	172040	That'd be alright.
172040	173040	Make a hat?
173200	174200	That'd be great.
174200	175200	Alright.
175200	177760	I'm really sorry about the beginning of this episode.
177760	180080	I didn't mean for it to happen this way.
180080	186280	I got picked up for an Uber tonight and I don't know why I can't, I can't, I can't penetrate
186280	187280	the lift membrane.
187280	188280	I don't know why.
188280	191600	I've had nothing but good experiences with lift, but I keep going back to Uber like an
191600	199680	abusive, like an abused boyfriend, like Abe Lincoln crawling back to Mary Todd no matter
199680	203040	how hard she hits him.
203040	210720	Wasn't there some rumor about that?
210720	212240	She was so crazy she beat Abe?
212240	213240	Yeah.
213240	215560	What was there some rumor about that Abe Lincoln was a battered husband?
215560	216560	What?
216560	218800	I can't be just making that up.
218800	220680	I mean, I can be.
220680	223120	I wish you had that deep of imagination.
223120	224120	Yeah, exactly.
224120	225120	Me too.
225120	226120	Yeah.
226120	227120	I don't, I think I must, I feel like I heard that somewhere.
227120	228120	Okay.
228120	230400	So we'll find out tomorrow online.
230400	238520	So I got into the Uber and the new, new, new thing, the guy, I get into the Uber and the
238520	244880	guy has a paper and pencil, a piece of typing paper and a pencil.
244880	251040	And he says in the Uber app, as you know, you type in, you know, your address where
251040	252040	you want to get picked up.
252040	254080	And then you type, now you can type in your destination.
254080	258800	So you would think a little less talking, maybe a little less maintenance.
258800	264200	I get into the car and the guy says, where are you going?
264200	265200	And this happens a lot.
265200	269560	And I just, I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I just, I just went like, isn't
269560	270560	it on the thing?
270560	271800	Like, look at the thing.
271800	272800	Cause I can see it.
272800	273800	It's on the armrest.
273800	279280	There's like a map on his phone, a blinking, like, like, like a hologram of me saying,
279280	281720	but this is where you drive me.
281720	283080	But he's got the pen and paper out.
283080	287320	And he had, and he pulled, and then he goes like, what, what's, what street?
287320	289600	And I said, wait, look on the thing.
289600	291120	It's, it's on, it's on sunset.
291120	292120	He's like, well, what street?
292120	293120	He was Dan.
293120	294120	Was this guy Asian?
294120	295120	No.
295120	296120	I'm joking.
296120	297120	I'm joking.
297120	298560	I'm joking.
298560	301680	I just realized I, he was talking about my street.
301680	304000	He was talking about the street I live on.
304000	307960	And he wanted to know how to spell it because he wanted to write it down on a piece of typing
307960	315320	paper with a pencil to murder his leg, like a, like a weird, like emotionally challenged
315320	320680	a junior in high school, like who was trying to get his homework done on the bus.
320680	326680	He's just like writing, scribbling, scrawling my, the name of my street, Dan, was it, is
326680	328840	it keeping a cooked book or something?
328840	330240	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
330240	332000	Now I, now I told you what street I live on.
332000	335640	So it's all I paused in the middle of that.
335640	337040	It's a long street.
337040	341480	So it's a, it's a, it's at least six houses long.
341480	346920	You'll never find the gate with H on it.
346920	349440	Just look for the Uber car out front.
349440	355080	Just look for the line of Uber cars, man, the lift lift is way more fun.
355080	357400	It's faster and easier for my entertainment dollar.
357400	358400	Well now it doesn't matter.
358400	363440	I'm going to be murdered on by Monday, like three people who will only be doing things
363440	364440	with the best intentions.
364440	366680	So you took it, you took a couple of lifts though, right?
366680	368480	Or just one?
368480	371400	I took two lifts and I had a good time in both.
371400	372400	Yeah.
372400	373400	Yeah.
373400	375800	I mean, I just, I know it's the front seat thing.
375800	376800	You don't have to sit in the front.
376800	377800	I know.
377800	378800	But that's, then you're weird.
378800	380440	In a lift, you get in the backseat and you're weird.
380440	382680	I accidentally sat in the back.
382680	387120	Sometimes I sat in the front of an Uber, nobody, nobody seems to care.
387120	388120	Uber's just a bummer.
388120	389120	I don't know.
389120	392320	Like that's fucking, it's slow and funky and I don't like it.
392320	393320	Hygiene corner.
393320	401280	Hygiene corner, going to find a good song for it because it's Hygiene Corner.
401280	407040	It's a lot like sports corner.
407040	418440	It's when you clean yourself, yo, yo, Hygiene Corner, calling all scientists, please.
418440	421240	The planet only has so much time left.
421240	425400	We're all dying.
425400	428560	We're not going to make it to the moon.
428560	431520	The globals are warming.
431520	434840	The tides are rising.
434840	438640	AIDS is airborne.
438640	442400	By the time you hear this recording, maybe it will be.
442400	448400	All I'm saying is before we die, could someone just make a pill that makes your fingernails
448400	450400	stop growing?
451400	455880	Just make a, how hard can that be?
455880	458840	Has this become a big burden in your life?
458840	464800	Only for 41 years or so since I was born with these pointless fingernails that constantly
464800	475680	grow unless you take a medieval appliance and use pressure and hewn metal to chisel
475680	479720	off chunks of lifeless carotene?
479720	480720	What is it, chitin?
480720	481720	What the fuck is on us?
481720	482720	What is this shit?
482720	486160	Why do we have it?
486160	489240	It's from before punching was invented.
489240	492000	It's like it regenerates so you can pick up your keys.
492000	495920	I don't use my nails to pick up my keys.
495920	498080	Your credit card off the bar?
498080	499080	You need that.
499080	503520	If they get damaged, they have to regenerate, like a rodent's teeth has to regenerate the
503520	505640	dentin to burrow and shit, man.
505720	511240	I guess if we're using them, you know, you never scratch yourself.
511240	516480	You never, yeah, you never, but I just feel like if we didn't have them, then we wouldn't
516480	523920	itch as much and we, and we'd make keys thicker and credit cards with little handles on them.
523920	530920	Like we would, we don't have a belly button tentacle, but it's not like we, we, we, we
530920	535560	notice it's gone all the time because we don't have any devices.
535560	538080	You know, there's not like our rope to get into each building.
538080	540240	It's like, use your belly button tentacle to get it.
540240	541240	Oh fuck.
541240	546160	Like let's just get rid of the fucking fingernails or just make them stop growing.
546160	547160	Just make them stop growing.
547160	548440	What if you damaged one?
548440	554880	What if you, uh, like you, uh, then you take the antidote for a week and make them grow
554880	555880	a little bit.
555880	556880	If you work for big pharma, is that your thing?
556880	557880	I don't know.
557880	559480	It's a weird drug push right now.
559480	560480	Okay.
561040	565600	No, no pills, a better device than these clippers.
565600	567200	They're called your back teeth, Jack.
567200	568200	I bite my fingernails.
568200	569200	Look at these.
569200	570200	Perfect.
570200	572520	I'm a perfect fingernail biter.
572520	573520	Gross.
573520	574800	It's weird.
574800	577720	What grosses people out doesn't gross other people out.
577720	580760	Biting your toenails is gross, but people do it.
580760	581760	Anyone here bite the toenails?
581760	582760	What?
582760	583760	No one's going to bite.
583760	584760	How do you?
584760	585760	There's people that do it.
585760	586760	My brother.
586760	587760	Your brother does?
587760	588760	My brother has it.
588760	589760	Oh.
589760	590760	You can do it?
590760	591760	Yeah.
591760	592760	That's, that's horrifying.
592760	595320	He has to, he has to lift his foot all the way up to his...
595320	597600	Is he a yogi?
597600	598600	That's flexible.
598600	599600	I couldn't.
599600	600600	I couldn't if I wanted to.
600600	601600	Do you know what I mean?
601600	602600	Yeah.
602600	603600	I guess it is jealousy.
603600	608520	All right, Jeff, uh, a, uh, a, a bootlegger.
608520	610320	Are we, are we still on hygiene corner?
610320	611320	No.
611320	612320	Do you want a new segment?
612320	613320	No.
613320	614320	Hygiene.
614320	617320	That was hygiene corner.
618320	619320	I, I just like, I like bookends.
619320	620320	There was a guy that got 33 months in prison.
620320	621320	Somebody tweeted me a link to an article.
621320	622320	I believe this was in the UK.
622320	635440	Some guy, uh, uh, recorded Fast of the Furious 9, whatever they're on, in the theater, you
635440	636680	know, like they do.
636680	642880	He uploaded it onto the web and was charging like a pound 50 for, uh, for torrent downloads
642880	643880	of it.
643880	647600	And they caught him and they sentenced him to 33 months in prison.
647600	652880	You should be sentenced that much for just going to that movie in the first place.
652880	654880	Sing.
654880	656600	Obviously making an example of this guy.
656600	657600	33 years.
657600	658600	It's pretty fucking disgusting.
658600	661000	Wait, he, he was already sentenced to that.
661000	662000	That's the sentence.
662000	664000	Uh, he has been sentenced.
664000	665000	33, not 33 years.
665000	668160	Why don't I get, did I, I said, okay, sorry, I heard yours.
668160	669160	Okay.
669160	670160	Uh, 33 months.
670160	671160	That's ridiculous.
671160	672160	It's crazy.
672160	674240	I mean, obviously all it comes down to is money.
674240	678880	So in the, in the article, which is clearly slanted towards, like they use the guy's worst
678880	679880	photo.
679880	683520	He's leaning against a Camaro flipping the finger.
683520	688080	They every, every quote from him, like he would post stuff to his Facebook page and
688080	693760	then the guy that sentenced him, like referenced him saying shit on the Facebook page, which
693760	694760	is crazy.
694760	698680	Like when they're a sentencing, they're like, clearly you, you know, everything we need
698680	702320	to know about your attitude is all in that Facebook post from yesterday.
702320	703320	What the fuck?
703320	704320	What are we in eighth grade?
704320	712360	What kind of do, what in the do process more like do not process, don't, don't process.
712360	713360	Don't.
713360	718520	Uh, what, what, uh, what, uh, how much money did he make?
718520	722680	Well, they, they, they tabulated what he cost universal.
722680	724680	Uh, I think that's the studio.
725680	730360	Uh, they, so all these people wouldn't go by the DVD cause we all know that's how exactly
730360	731360	how everything works.
731360	732520	Cause we're, we're all Sims.
732520	740520	Like you, you'd only download a torrent of fast and the furious six, uh, uh, if you were
740520	743880	unable to get out to the theaters and watch it.
743880	747680	And of course if you downloaded it means you definitely would have gone to the theater.
747680	752840	Uh, that's the first erroneous, uh, piece of math, but, but they, they use a bunch of,
752920	758520	uh, you know, theoretical math to figure that this guy cost universal, I don't know, tens
758520	759920	or hundreds of millions of dollars.
759920	769200	You know, they tabulated, uh, and, and, uh, and he, uh, obviously it's just, okay, so,
769200	774680	so rich people run the world, the money makes the world go around.
774680	778120	It should be a crime to fuck with rich people, I guess.
778120	780040	I mean, it's their world.
780040	783360	Like why, why put them in prison?
783360	786720	Like why are you putting, why like, what is, how much money is he going to make anybody
786720	787720	in prison?
787720	794040	Like send them to, send them to like, uh, universal studios camp or something like put
794040	797880	him in a Panda outfit and make him, make him drive that tram.
797880	798880	Yeah.
798880	801960	Make a, like, like, like, like great theme parks that are like cheaper because they're
801960	809600	peopled with criminals who stole movies or something, you know, like, oh, it's, it sure
809600	810600	is hot in here.
810600	819360	It'd be a lot less hot if I hadn't, uh, for taking in hot, hot merchandise, if you can't
819360	820360	stand the heat.
820360	821360	Like, like Backdraft.
821360	828600	Well, speaking of which the Backdraft stunt show starting over here, uh, you know, it's
828600	835560	like, they could just kind of blend confession with, uh, with helping, helping paying customers
835560	837080	and then they work off their debt.
837080	838720	Well, do it that way.
838720	845520	Put people in prison, unless they're going to stab somebody, this should be this pretty
845520	847360	simple rule with prison, right?
847360	852080	Like, like when should you put a guy in a, uh, in a little cubicle that he can't get
852080	857200	out of physically when he, when he would physically do something bad if he was out?
857200	860760	What about like Bernie Madoff who ruined a lot of people's lives?
860760	863520	I think there's got to, well, first of all, do we really punish these people?
863520	866400	I mean, is that, that's an example of a guy is doing time, right?
866400	867400	Yeah.
867400	872040	But like, I mean, not to get off on that tangent, but you know, there's a, there's
872040	877760	a pretty big disparity in the amount of these people that actually do see hard justice.
877760	883560	Uh, uh, so, so why not commit to that idea that anybody that commits a crime that is
883560	890240	financial in origin has to suffer some kind of financial punishment, you know?
890240	891240	What's the big deal?
891240	892240	I don't get it.
892240	894080	And also pills that make your toenails stop growing.
894080	895080	That's it.
895440	896720	I don't have all the answers.
896720	900720	Uh, uh, tweet me at suck, suck, suck my dick.
900720	902720	I don't care.
902720	904400	And suck, suck, suck my dick?
904400	905400	Yeah.
905400	910920	Well, obviously suck, suck my dick and suck, suck my dick were both taken because Twitter's
910920	912480	been around for like 15 years.
912480	915960	So suck, suck, suck my dick.
915960	918360	There's lots of underscores and shit like that.
918360	919360	All right.
919360	920360	All right.
920360	921360	What else we got here?
921360	922360	Oh yeah.
922360	928080	The Uber trip, silence for the half way, half the car ride except for all that rigmarole
928080	929080	in the beginning.
929080	930080	No, just follow the map.
930080	931080	Then we're driving.
931080	934080	It's really quiet for a long time.
934080	940800	And then, and then he just says, uh, it's cooled down, huh?
940800	945880	And I, and it just made me think, and I was like, yeah, like, and it made me like, I mean,
945880	950800	you know, this is not new territory to talk about, but like talking about weather, like
950800	951800	it really is insane.
951800	954640	Cause we're like, what if we, what if he said cooled down, huh?
954640	959080	What if I had said, no, I disagree.
959080	961560	I don't think it has cooled down.
961560	967520	Now we're in a small argument.
967520	970720	George Takei as a hero saw a documentary about him.
970720	972640	What, what, what did he do?
972640	973640	You know what he did?
973640	974640	Jeff?
974640	975640	It's just occurred to me.
975640	979360	Aside from, aside from delighting us on TV for so many years, he's always been a delightful
979360	980360	personality.
980360	981360	That's silly.
981360	986960	He talks like this, no matter what he's talking about, but, but this guy, and he's very happy
986960	991760	go lucky and he's kind of, kind of talks like a game show host, but, but I realized we'll
991760	993120	watch the documentary.
993120	998600	This guy has been, uh, I don't want to use too strong language, but I don't, I also don't
998600	1005280	want to fucking stretch out a big long daisy chain of words just so it's not that strong.
1005280	1009320	I mean, I realized that other people have had it harder than in the life, but I just
1009320	1015000	want to say like George Takei as a jolly old man, he's been betrayed by his country
1015000	1019880	twice in his lifetime, once because of his race and once because of his orientation.
1019880	1024640	Like he has had, he, he spent his childhood in a Japanese American internment camp and
1024640	1033440	still like exited with enough like, uh, altruism and, and, and magnanimity and an optimism to,
1033440	1035060	to have a good life.
1035060	1037900	You know, if you, if you let that get you down, I'm sure a lot of people left those
1037900	1042740	camps all fucked up and bitter and, and, and, and fucked for life.
1042740	1047780	Uh, but, and then having done that, then he had to be, you know, he didn't have to be,
1047780	1053580	but he kind of had to be, uh, uh, in the closet for, for, you know, like in order to get acting
1053580	1055020	work and stuff.
1055020	1059500	And then he, you know, it's like the, the, the equal marriage rights thing.
1059500	1063100	Like he found himself then at the forefront of that phase, like people telling him you
1063100	1065340	shouldn't be allowed to get married if you're gay.
1065340	1070460	And every, every time at each turn, this is a country that this guy loves and he loves
1070460	1072580	everybody and he likes talking to people.
1072580	1076100	And I like having conversations and he's, and he's not like diluted.
1076100	1082460	It's not like he's Regis Philbin, just like, oh, he just, he's sat there, but he's like,
1082460	1084780	he's meeting head on like these controversies.
1084780	1088700	He's like, he's, and he's transparent and honest and sincere when he talks about them,
1088700	1092580	about his experiences at this camp and in his experiences, like on the forefront of,
1092580	1094900	of fighting for gay rights.
1094900	1100940	And uh, and, and yet, but, but at no point does he do what I, what I did when the Ferguson
1100940	1104700	thing happened, which is just like throw my hands in the air and get all mad and whiny
1104700	1106780	and start screeching and to tap on my lungs.
1106780	1109260	If everybody did that, we'd really be fucked.
1109260	1110260	Like it was kind of inspiring.
1110260	1114180	I thought, you know, maybe if always find the humor and, and the George Takei, where
1114180	1118980	was this documentary on, uh, I don't know, the Takei network.
1118980	1119980	I don't know.
1119980	1123580	Did I tell you that I was, I was on a plane with him and we were coming back from a gig
1123580	1127220	and it was like, I was with Greg Proops and he sat across from us and like, we were like
1127220	1132380	row two and he was in row one and, uh, it was like fucking Tzulu is on the fucking plane.
1132380	1136260	Like, like this play can't crash.
1136260	1139460	Everybody on the plane was like, we're, we're good.
1139460	1143100	And so we're boarding the plane because we had been with him in security and he was in
1143100	1146780	front of us checking in, but then he got, he was with like his like assistant or handler
1146780	1149420	or wrangler or maybe, maybe companion.
1149420	1150420	I don't know.
1150420	1151420	Like buddy, friend, boyfriend.
1151420	1152420	I had no idea.
1152420	1155380	I think Tzulu, Tzulu, God damn it.
1155380	1156380	George Takei was a little under the weather.
1156380	1160180	He had a kind of a cough and this guy was like keeping him like, you know, like making
1160180	1163340	sure he was warm and stuff and being very attentive and nice.
1163340	1167740	And then we kept getting in front of him and, uh, so we were, uh, Greg was in front of him
1167740	1168740	getting on a plane.
1168740	1172820	I was behind him and he gets on and the guy who's beep, boop, like, thank you, Mr. Davis.
1172820	1173820	Boop.
1173820	1174820	Thank you, Mr. Proops.
1174820	1175820	Mr. George Takei.
1175820	1178820	And, and just, he goes, well, hello.
1178820	1185380	And he goes, and he goes, uh, I'm a, I'm a big fan of yours, which is, okay, well, thank
1185380	1186380	you very much.
1186380	1187380	It's very nice to hear.
1187380	1189420	And then he goes, I forget the show.
1189420	1193340	Was he on like a, uh, like, uh, family guy or something like that?
1193340	1196020	Like he, a guest start on some show or whatever.
1196020	1197020	Was it?
1197020	1198020	Yeah.
1198020	1199020	Family guy.
1199020	1200020	And he goes, he goes, I saw your family guys.
1200020	1201020	And he goes, Oh, that's very good news.
1201020	1203100	I can expect a residual.
1203100	1204100	Yeah.
1204100	1210740	And he is, he and his husband are very, uh, they're a cute couple.
1210740	1214820	They're very, very inspiring to, to, they're, you know, they're an older couple now, but
1214820	1219660	they're there and they're not like making out with each other and every step or trying
1219660	1223460	to prove something, but they're clearly in love and they're like soulmates and they walk
1223460	1228020	around hand in hand and it's, uh, it's a check out the documentary.
1228020	1229020	It's a cute little thing.
1229020	1230020	I don't know what it's called.
1230020	1240060	Be me, be me over to, uh, you should be, be me out, be me out of the closet.
1240060	1248060	I don't know of the, of the, of the internment camp, of the closet, be me, be me out, uh,
1248060	1249060	everywhere it goes.
1249060	1251780	Someone's trying to keep me in somewhere.
1251780	1254140	Where was this beaming technology when I needed it?
1254140	1255140	All right.
1255140	1256740	Well, that's the end of my notes.
1256740	1262500	I think that, uh, yeah, I wore the wrong shirt or it's these, it's these goddamn lights.
1262500	1264420	I was saying a pin again.
1264420	1265620	Navy is a good color on you.
1265620	1266620	You look, you look very dynamic.
1266620	1267620	Well, it absorbs heat.
1267620	1270180	I should have worn tin foil.
1270180	1273780	I don't think that would work either.
1273780	1274780	That would heat in too.
1274780	1277620	That would be like a potato.
1277620	1281940	I should have worn mirrors like the lady in Dancehall Days.
1281940	1287780	It's there to reflect everything outward.
1287780	1291780	I bet that lady in Dancehall Days was cold as a cucumber, but she comes out of the disco
1291780	1294980	ball and she's covered in disco mirrors.
1294980	1306820	We were so, in, face, in my dance, hall, dance, this is, this is, this is from the video.
1306820	1316340	What is, what is, what is, when I sing, sing all the words, I don't open my mouth and napkins
1316340	1317500	on my shoe.
1317500	1320820	I never knew the words of that song.
1320820	1324860	No, he's saying, take your baby by the heel.
1324860	1325860	Take her by the heel.
1325860	1328340	No, that's, that's by the hand for sure.
1328340	1331380	No, it's, they say he says hand and then he says heel later.
1331380	1332380	What?
1332380	1333380	Yeah.
1333380	1334380	Does he really?
1334380	1335380	Yeah.
1336380	1345540	And look up, and look up fingernails and Fast and the Furious at, at www.sucksucksuckmydick.com.
1345540	1347780	Let's bring up an early Spencer Crittenden.
1347780	1349780	Early, Crittenden.
1359780	1363540	Just to get out of these lights, man, I gotta get out, I gotta get, it's like one of those
1363540	1368020	things it's like, it's like, oh, that's nice of them.
1368020	1371300	Well, I don't want to be responsible for people being unable to see me.
1371300	1372980	No, we can still see them.
1372980	1373980	Okay.
1373980	1374980	You still reflect light.
1374980	1375980	All right.
1375980	1376980	Hello.
1376980	1377980	Spencer.
1377980	1378980	Hey.
1378980	1384420	Spencer, you're on at 826, 827, is that the earliest you've ever been out here?
1384420	1385580	I don't know, man.
1385580	1386580	Feels like.
1386580	1387580	Maybe on this stage.
1387580	1392980	Spencer, did you get high since I last saw you five minutes ago?
1392980	1396700	No, I got a, I'm feeling just weird in the stomach.
1396700	1398260	It's, it's, it's throwing me off.
1398260	1400300	I'm having a good time though.
1400300	1402180	I'm glad to be here.
1402180	1403180	Do you have to make chocolate cookies?
1403180	1404420	In this fine country.
1404420	1411100	No, I'm sure I will before this day is done, but right now I'm here, I'm seated, ready
1411100	1412460	to do some comedy.
1412460	1416020	Did you eat some, did you eat a misguided burrito or something?
1416020	1417020	I think I did.
1417020	1418020	Yeah.
1418020	1421020	I went to 7-Eleven and I got two taquitos and they were really delicious and I've never
1421020	1425620	had them before, but I'm already like, no, see the thing.
1425620	1426620	Here's the thing.
1426620	1427620	7-Eleven.
1427620	1432260	They have all this food that's like crappy food and it's, it all is like, it has flavor,
1432260	1436660	but it also has this consistency that's very microwaved.
1436660	1440580	But the thing is I eat food that I cook in the microwave.
1440580	1443140	So like it's not that big of a deal, right?
1443140	1446260	But you know, these are the ones that are rolling around.
1446260	1447260	Yeah.
1447260	1448900	They're those rolling taquitos.
1448940	1453140	I get a lot of hot dogs, no incident, but man, taquitos.
1453140	1455780	I don't think a 7-Eleven is a food destination really.
1455780	1456780	Well, that's the thing.
1456780	1460940	That's why you can't complain too much is because otherwise, why would you come here?
1460940	1461940	Right?
1461940	1466580	But, uh, no, I mean, I was just, I got, I got, you know, I came into the meltdown.
1466580	1467580	I parked.
1467580	1469260	I was like, let's go to 7-Eleven.
1469260	1475140	You know, I would rather have like a big bucket of noodles, but that wasn't on the table.
1475140	1476660	Is bucket of noodles still open?
1476660	1477660	Yeah.
1477660	1478660	It's not on Sundays.
1478660	1479660	That's the thing.
1479660	1480660	They're all Christian.
1480660	1481660	It's sad, really.
1481660	1487860	A big ramen, big, big, big bucket of ramen without even that much soup in it.
1487860	1488860	Yeah.
1488860	1491340	Just eat a big brick of ramen that's like lightly boiled.
1491340	1493500	That's what I'd like to do.
1493500	1494940	Make me feel 25 again.
1494940	1495940	Today's cheat day.
1495940	1497460	What do you, what do you have for cheat day?
1497460	1504980	I found out Aaron came back from, uh, from wherever she was and she, uh, I was looking,
1504980	1507220	I was like, well, it's cheat day.
1507220	1512080	So I'm, I could eat anything I, I want, but then I was playing Minecraft and I was too
1512080	1515980	lazy to get up to eat food.
1515980	1516980	And uh.
1516980	1517980	Did you waste a cheat day?
1517980	1522540	And then I thought I was, cause it was like 4.30 when Aaron came back and, and I was like,
1522540	1526020	fuck man, we got some catching up to do.
1526020	1527420	And she said, what do you mean?
1527420	1528420	I said, cheat day.
1528420	1530220	She said, we don't get a cheat day this week.
1530220	1531220	I said, why?
1531220	1536540	She's like, we had pizza on Wednesday, Wednesday.
1536540	1539380	I don't even remember.
1539380	1542660	We cheated on Wednesday.
1542660	1545540	Like it wasn't, it wasn't even good pizza.
1545540	1546540	Whatever it was.
1546540	1547540	It was like.
1547540	1549500	Now she's going to spin class every day.
1549500	1551300	She's on day seven, I believe.
1551300	1552300	Right?
1552300	1553300	Yeah.
1553300	1554700	Are you, are you going to, is that going to inspire you to maybe get my little fitness
1554700	1555700	kick yourself or?
1555700	1557300	I am on a fitness kick.
1557300	1561220	This is as fitness kick as I get is trying to be on a diet.
1561220	1562820	I'm not going to go to spin class.
1562820	1565420	No, it's not going to happen.
1565420	1566420	You should go.
1567420	1568420	A lot of fun.
1568420	1569420	Yeah.
1569420	1573060	Douglas Adams died in a treadmill.
1573060	1574060	Is he dead?
1574060	1577540	You know, I don't know a lot of things about people.
1577540	1579980	I mean, who keeps track of who died?
1579980	1582580	That seems like depressing, right?
1582580	1586180	I wasn't trying to keep track.
1586180	1588580	I was just being defensive, overly defensive.
1588580	1590660	It's nothing you've done.
1590660	1594340	I brought you up here early because you made a new friend.
1594340	1595340	Oh yeah.
1595340	1601700	Well, I mean, I guess Spencer's been hanging out with a mutual friend
1601700	1602700	of ours.
1602700	1606180	He's been, he's been really logging some quality time with him and he just, it's a
1606180	1607420	blossoming friendship.
1607420	1608420	Do you feel jealous?
1608420	1609700	No, he does.
1609700	1610700	I'm very curious.
1610700	1611700	Yeah.
1611700	1614340	I mean that, yeah, that's what you're curious about.
1614340	1617860	Uh, should we bring them out and talk about your friendship?
1617860	1618860	You do whatever you want, man.
1618860	1622860	Do you think it'll, do you think it'll negatively affect the friendship to talk about it?
1622860	1623860	I know.
1623860	1625860	I mean, it couldn't help.
1625860	1629460	No, no, do it.
1629460	1630460	All right.
1630460	1633100	Ladies and gentlemen, Jack Nicholson.
1633100	1637020	No, it's, it's Nicholas Cage.
1637020	1640300	Whatever it was, that would be great.
1640300	1644380	Let's bring to the stage, uh, Spencer's new friend, real Abed.
1644380	1645380	Abed Gaeth.
1645380	1646380	Abed Gaeth to the stage.
1646380	1647380	Real Abed.
1647380	1648380	Real Abed.
1648380	1654380	Slightly less dimensionalized than my creation.
1654380	1657380	Oh yeah.
1657380	1665380	I killed the song, didn't I?
1665380	1666380	No, you, you, you tagged it.
1666380	1667380	Oh yeah.
1667380	1668380	Yeah.
1668380	1669380	Uh, it's been awhile since you've been up here.
1669380	1670380	Can I say something?
1670380	1671380	Yep.
1671380	1673660	So those lights, the new ones, oh, you mean these ones.
1673660	1674660	Yeah.
1674660	1678500	The orange ones kind of remind me of like the restaurant at Pirates of the Caribbean.
1678500	1682220	It's like, remember you go by and you're like, fuck, I'm going to get, I'm going to eat at
1682220	1683220	that restaurant like tonight.
1683220	1684220	The blue, the blue bayou.
1684220	1686220	I keep going by, wanting to do it.
1686220	1687220	I never do it.
1687220	1688220	It's like, this is the time.
1688220	1689540	I'm going to do it this time.
1689540	1691500	I had the same memory.
1691500	1692540	That's exactly what I was thinking of.
1692540	1696220	Like last week, I called him with something like, like a Caribbean bungalow or something
1696220	1697220	like that.
1697220	1698220	It looks kind of Caribbean.
1698220	1700540	It didn't sound like it made any sense, but that's what I was thinking of is that fucking
1700540	1703420	restaurant that you go through to the Pirates of the Caribbean.
1703420	1705220	Doesn't it look like the most amazing restaurant?
1705220	1706740	It looks like it would be great to eat there.
1706740	1707740	It's not that great.
1707740	1708740	It's not that great.
1708740	1709740	No, the conversation.
1709740	1710740	From that side.
1710740	1712180	Oh, those people are really into the ride.
1712180	1713180	Looks like a great restaurant.
1713180	1716860	Oh no, those people, like they're kind of into it, but one person's scared.
1716860	1719820	Once in a while, like when you're on that ride, when you get on Pirates of the Caribbean
1719820	1725820	and you just, you just start moving and right on the right is the Blue Bayou restaurant.
1725820	1726820	It's really quiet.
1726820	1727820	It's very tranquil.
1727820	1728820	It's called the Blue Bayou.
1728820	1729820	The Blue Bayou.
1729820	1730820	No, I knew that.
1730820	1731820	I did.
1731820	1733820	What was Pirates of the Caribbean the restaurant?
1733820	1736820	Pirates of the Caribbean of the restaurant.
1736820	1740900	I was like, oh, that's the Pirates of the Caribbean the ride restaurant.
1740900	1741900	That's the ride restaurant.
1741900	1744220	Pirates of the Caribbean, the movie, the ride, the restaurant.
1744220	1750260	It'd be amazing if on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, you started as regular passengers and
1750260	1753580	then like most of those rides, you get kind of indoctrinated into the thing.
1753580	1759380	If you got actually turned into a pirate on the ride and then at the end, you got to steal
1759380	1761900	a village, the restaurant, steal somebody's butter.
1761900	1762900	Yeah.
1762900	1763900	Yeah.
1763900	1764900	Now go get them.
1764900	1765900	The hearties.
1765900	1766900	Fuck you.
1766900	1767900	Give me your butter.
1767900	1768900	Have you seen?
1768900	1770980	I've seen some of these old pirate movies.
1770980	1771980	They don't fuck around.
1771980	1776220	Like they really stab and bite and like, oh, like cling to the barnacle.
1776220	1777220	Like there's no tomorrow.
1777220	1778220	What?
1778220	1779220	What?
1779220	1780220	What?
1780220	1781220	What movie did you see?
1781220	1782220	What movie did you see a pirate clinging to a barnacle?
1782220	1784860	I was, it was Blackbeard the pirate.
1784860	1785860	It was that movie.
1785860	1787820	It was really awesome, but it was fucked up, man.
1787820	1789460	Blackbeard is quite a character.
1789460	1792580	But I think, I think, you know, barnacles are famous for their clanging.
1792580	1793580	My treasure.
1793580	1795460	And it's like, you can't fuck with him.
1795460	1801460	Like I was like, I never, I'd never fuck with Blackbeard, you know, I would never fuck with
1801460	1802460	him.
1802460	1807860	Which I would see you being a pretty valuable, uh, shipmate if you're on a pirate ship.
1807860	1808860	I'd see you.
1808860	1809860	Yeah.
1809860	1812100	I mean, if I were a captain, I think I could put you to some good use.
1812100	1813540	You look like you could tie some knots.
1813540	1814540	Yeah.
1814540	1815540	I could like tie knots.
1815540	1821420	No, I could do that, but I would choose to just be like a survivor.
1821420	1824060	I'd probably hide like high up.
1824060	1827740	So whenever there's a crazy mutiny, I'm just like watching it like, Oh my God.
1827740	1828740	Oh my God.
1828740	1829740	Good thing I climbed up here.
1829740	1830740	Holy shit.
1830740	1831740	Every time there's a mutiny.
1831740	1835740	But what if Blackbeard, what if, what if your captain is Blackbeard and he goes, Arr, bed,
1835740	1837460	get down here and join the fray.
1837460	1839660	Call me Arr, bed, get down here.
1839660	1840660	Arr.
1840660	1842420	How can you not be partaken in this week's mutiny?
1842940	1845940	See, I would be the ship's jester, so that would suck.
1845940	1847340	Did you say entertain him?
1847340	1848740	He'd always know if I was missing.
1848740	1850860	He'd just like, yeah, where is that Arr, bed?
1850860	1851860	It's comedy.
1851860	1852860	Arr, bed.
1852860	1853860	Get over here.
1853860	1856620	So they would just call you Arr, bed because they can't, they wouldn't be able to pronounce
1856620	1857620	Arr.
1857620	1858620	I know.
1858620	1859620	Yeah.
1859620	1860620	He just loves saying Arr, bed.
1860620	1861620	He gets mad when he starts saying it.
1861620	1864660	So he's like Arr, and then he remembers bed and he goes, bed, Arr, bed, all right.
1864660	1865660	I did.
1865660	1866820	I always, I always wonder that too.
1866820	1871340	Like, could you climb up, like, like up there with some, could you just, could you just
1871340	1872500	stay out of trouble?
1872500	1876060	I think so, because they had like this cool, like, Swiss family Robinson deal where it
1876060	1877060	was like a little.
1877060	1878060	You're a sitting duck up there.
1878060	1882260	The people have harka busses and blunder busses and whatnot, so just fucking, you're, you're,
1882260	1883260	you're sitting, sitting.
1883260	1886260	But if no one sees you, like, you climb out in the middle of the night when everyone's
1886260	1887580	hiding that crow's nest.
1887580	1889140	Was there a member about harka bus?
1889140	1890140	Yeah.
1890140	1891140	What is that?
1891140	1892540	Harka, it's a, it's another match lock, guns along.
1892540	1894100	It's like a precursor, I believe, to a blunder.
1894100	1895420	It took a longer rifle.
1895420	1896420	Hmm.
1896420	1897420	Yeah.
1897420	1898420	Well, those pirate movies though, they're pretty nuts.
1898420	1899420	Let me tell you.
1900420	1903660	The old ones, it looks like you're on the ride.
1903660	1904660	Like it's amazing.
1904660	1907180	Like I look, like everything looks like a set.
1907180	1908180	It's beautiful.
1908180	1909180	It's like.
1909180	1911540	You know where Shiver My Timbers comes from?
1911540	1914420	That's from, God, Are You in the Bounty?
1914420	1915420	No, no.
1915420	1917180	You, now you have to answer.
1917180	1920300	Why did you just leap into, oh, that's, I got that one.
1920300	1922380	Okay, I got this one, guys.
1922380	1923380	Jesus.
1923380	1924380	I mean, I don't know for sure.
1924380	1926500	I've heard one, one story about what, where we get the term.
1926500	1927500	Shiver me timbers.
1927500	1930060	Where would you think, Abed, real Abed, that Shiver me timbers come from?
1930060	1935060	I would say, like, it would have to be like an old pirate movie, but it might be a pirate
1935060	1936060	series.
1936060	1938060	You know, I'm going to go with pirate movie.
1938060	1942100	Maybe it's Captain Courageous or something?
1942100	1943100	Captain's Courageous?
1943100	1944100	Captain's Courageous?
1944100	1947220	I believe it actually comes from actual pirate, like, terminology.
1947220	1951700	I assume it's just your boat's made out of wood, and if it's shivering, like if there's
1951700	1958180	a, if you're in high seas and it's really scary out, like, the foremost way of knowing
1958180	1962420	that you're in deep shit is that your timbers are shaking.
1962420	1964420	Your boat's like, creaking.
1964420	1969380	From what I read, it was, one of the most common injuries when you got hit by a broadside
1969380	1972540	cannonball, it wasn't the cannonball that was likely to hit you, it was going to hit
1972540	1976620	the wood, and you would get hit by splinters, and they called those shivers.
1976620	1981380	So you died by getting, like, shrapnel with wood, that if it didn't kill you outright,
1981380	1986900	you would die of infection eventually, because you just had gross, rotting shipwood stuck
1986900	1987900	in your body.
1987900	1988900	Shipwood, huh?
1988900	1991900	Well, you know, I would have thought that it's just, like, the guy's balls, and he's
1991900	1996100	like cold, and he's like, oh, my timbers are shivering, oh!
1996100	1997100	That's what I thought.
1997100	2001020	Like, it's something funny like that, and he leaps into this, like, dark, like, splinters
2001020	2003300	attacking you like a crazy Hellraiser movie.
2003300	2004780	Yeah, I know.
2004780	2008940	What's with that guy?
2008940	2009940	What is he crazy?
2009940	2010940	I know.
2011500	2014580	So, you and Spencer have been hanging out?
2014580	2021580	Well, you know, it's funny that you say this because, like, it's odd that he says that.
2021580	2022580	Is that better?
2022580	2023580	No, it's the premise.
2023580	2027580	It's strange that you would bring that up, because it's the topic of the conversation
2027580	2028580	that just started out.
2028580	2030580	It's crazy that you bring that up.
2030580	2031580	Interesting enough.
2031580	2032580	No, I don't know.
2032580	2036780	No, but see, he, like, I've been for his friend from the get-go, you know, from, like, the
2036780	2038620	first time I hung out here a couple of times.
2038620	2039620	From Jump Street.
2039980	2045420	Well, I would be at that crazy karaoke place, and for some reason, like, me and him always
2045420	2046420	just clicked.
2046420	2048340	I mean, I would just make jokes, and then he would laugh.
2048340	2049660	And then we'd just hang out, and I found out.
2049660	2050660	That's how you do it.
2050660	2051660	This guy likes muffins.
2051660	2052940	He likes Magic the Gathering.
2052940	2055740	It's like, you know, we find that we have stuff in common.
2055740	2056740	Right.
2056740	2057740	Muffins.
2057740	2060660	This is kind of weird to me, because Spencer's not a big laugher, and you're not...
2060660	2061660	And he hates muffins.
2061660	2062660	He...
2062660	2063660	Like, I don't...
2063660	2064660	Like, like, like...
2064660	2065660	He's a very...
2065660	2066660	If anyone listened to you joke around, it would be...
2066660	2069580	Yeah, they would feel like, how do I get the map away from him?
2070540	2073180	Well, their laughter limits would be tested.
2073180	2074180	Like, they...
2074180	2075180	Yeah, yeah.
2075180	2076180	I take people to laughter limits.
2076180	2079980	I find it very easy to be dry when I'm listening to you make jokes.
2079980	2080980	Well, you have to be because...
2080980	2082460	I'm not tempted to, like, guffaw.
2082460	2083460	Well, you...
2083460	2088140	Every relationship I have in that sense is, like, I'm always the, you know, the Castello
2088140	2090780	and everyone else is the Abbott, just like, what are you doing now?
2090780	2091780	Like, I...
2091780	2092780	Really?
2092780	2093780	Come on, Castello.
2093780	2094780	Don't do that.
2094780	2095780	Yes, you Abbottify a planet.
2095780	2100080	Be like, well, you know, Abbott, it's Babadoo and, like, if everyone...
2100080	2101580	Nobody really, like...
2101580	2102580	They're like, um, I...
2102580	2104620	We're in a supermarket.
2104620	2105620	What is happening that's Babadoo?
2105620	2106620	You know, I don't understand.
2106620	2107620	Yeah.
2107620	2111340	Yeah, it's like, they look around, because, like, you have to kind of put on the parental
2111340	2113140	hat to be like, all right, what is really...
2113140	2115500	Can we just get to the bottom of why I came here?
2115500	2116780	So where do you guys hang out?
2116780	2118780	Do you guys go get soup or do you get...
2118780	2121220	No, well, I mean, we hang out at a place.
2121220	2122220	We get muffins.
2122220	2123220	We get Portos.
2123220	2124780	Yeah, we go to the bakery Portos.
2125180	2126180	You get Portos.
2126180	2129980	We go to the 7-Eleven.
2129980	2130980	Back to back, though.
2130980	2131980	Nothing weird.
2131980	2132980	They sell muffins and pornography.
2132980	2133980	Have you rented the movie Shipwood?
2133980	2134980	Oh, man.
2134980	2135980	Shipwood.
2135980	2136980	Shipwood.
2136980	2140580	Dude, if I ever got Shipwood, you'd have to put a bullet in front of me.
2140580	2142820	It's like, there's no turning back from Shipwood.
2142820	2146100	What was the crossover for you guys being acquaintances that you'd met, you know, through
2146100	2147420	mutual friends to...
2147420	2149580	No, I met through you guys being the mutual friends.
2149580	2150580	Right, so what was the...
2150580	2155940	I mean, most recently, it was when we went to the fair together.
2155940	2157420	I think the Renaissance Fair.
2157420	2158420	Was that it?
2158420	2162020	I think we were hanging out a few times before that, but I mean, most recently, yeah.
2162020	2163020	That's probably the last time.
2163020	2164020	So right behind my back.
2164020	2165020	Like, I was there.
2165020	2166020	The front of your face.
2166020	2167020	I mean, you were there, too.
2167020	2168740	Like, under my nose and behind my back.
2168740	2169740	So you are jealous about this.
2169740	2173060	It wasn't like we were trying to hide it, like, run around and have a friendship behind
2173060	2174060	a corner.
2174060	2175540	Like, you were there on the trip.
2175540	2176540	I'm not jealous.
2176540	2177540	I just...
2177540	2178540	I feel like I'm cheating on you.
2178540	2182540	I need to be notified of new friendships.
2182540	2184500	I don't want to have to find out about them accidentally.
2184500	2186300	Should I notify you about every friendship that I...
2186300	2187300	Well, can I tell you something?
2187300	2188300	Like, my friendships are weird.
2188300	2189300	Oh, wait.
2189300	2190300	Go ahead.
2190300	2191300	No, I was...
2191300	2192300	I was just watching.
2192300	2193300	I had a...
2193300	2194300	I remember...
2194300	2197700	There's this one time I was driving around because I was smoking, it was early morning
2197700	2202620	on a Sunday morning, and you were on Twitter, and you were talking about how you were driving
2202620	2206540	around in the morning on Twitter, and then we started tweeting at each other while we
2206540	2207540	were driving.
2207540	2209540	Like, we should go run our cars into each other.
2209540	2210540	No, yeah, because we made a joke.
2210540	2214660	Because I was like, wait a minute, if he's tweeting and driving, it's gonna be dangerous.
2214660	2215660	Yeah.
2215660	2216660	You guys...
2216660	2217660	You guys get up early in the morning, go to a bakery?
2217660	2218660	That's how it started.
2218660	2219660	Well, first off, I was up all night, actually.
2219660	2221660	Yeah, he was up this morning, this one morning.
2221660	2225140	I was up all night because of those amazing breakfast burritos by my house, and I'm like,
2225140	2229540	I'm gonna get them this time, and, like, I waited, I waited, and it was, like, 6 a.m.,
2229540	2230540	and I'm like...
2230540	2233900	Then I'm tweeting about it because I'm like, I've got to stay awake for that burrito, so
2233900	2234900	I drove around.
2234900	2235900	I'm gonna stay awake.
2236780	2237780	But we were tweeting each other...
2237780	2238780	Oh, wait, you talk.
2238780	2242780	I'm just saying, I'm jealous because your lives are more exciting than mine.
2242780	2244780	They're not that exciting.
2244780	2245780	They're exciting.
2245780	2249300	I haven't looked forward to anything that much in the last 20 years.
2249300	2253300	So we were driving around waiting.
2253300	2254300	What do they have?
2254300	2255300	Would you guys hang out?
2255300	2256300	Do you talk at the same time?
2256300	2257300	Yeah, definitely.
2257300	2259820	No, it's kind of like, it's give and take, you know?
2259820	2262900	It's like, sometimes I gotta hold back, sometimes he's gotta hold back.
2262900	2264620	I'm holding back.
2264620	2265620	You know what I mean?
2265860	2266860	It's like a tug of war.
2266860	2267860	Yeah.
2267860	2268860	It's like, I'm tugging.
2268860	2269860	Okay, now he's gonna tug.
2269860	2270860	It's a real contest of war.
2270860	2272260	What is that tug of war we're trying to throw the fight?
2272260	2273260	What does it look like?
2273260	2278420	As someone who's known you for 9 to 13 years, I'd like to know what it looks like when you
2278420	2279420	hold back.
2279420	2280420	Like, show me...
2280420	2284660	I guess, like, if I'm mad, I'll just be quiet.
2284660	2285660	It's weird.
2285660	2286660	It sucks.
2286660	2287660	Yeah, he's usually mad with me.
2287660	2288660	Well, just show me for a second.
2288660	2291180	Pretend you're holding back.
2291220	2295620	So, Abed, man, I really love alternative music.
2295620	2298380	I wish there was somebody I could talk to about it.
2298380	2302420	That's not very holding it back.
2302420	2309340	No, actually, I don't really have much to say about it to an alternative music.
2309340	2311980	I mean, that's in the answer, I mean, that's in what it is.
2311980	2313580	Yeah, I didn't land that bit very well.
2313580	2316700	No, no, no, no, I don't have a theory on that.
2316700	2320540	Like, if you maybe change the topic, maybe that would be harder for me to resist.
2320540	2324700	Yeah, I wish I knew more about tornadoes or nuclear subs.
2324700	2326740	Oh, he's holding back.
2326740	2328660	That's more Spencer's Bayley Wick, I would think.
2328660	2329660	Sure is, yeah.
2329660	2331660	What do you need to know about Spencer?
2331660	2335260	See, you guys compliment, you guys complete each other.
2335260	2336260	That's what it is.
2336260	2337260	I saw this movie, I'm sorry.
2337260	2340700	It's like if Wikipedia was hanging out with, I don't know, Grindr?
2340700	2341700	What are you?
2341700	2342700	Grindr!
2342700	2345700	I don't know how to characterize you.
2345700	2346700	Grindr!
2347700	2348700	Grindr!
2348700	2352700	Wikipedia Grindr is like the perfect storm.
2352700	2357980	It's more like a cake website where you buy cakes and then I am like, what is this Grindr?
2357980	2358980	Like you grind shit?
2358980	2359980	No, I know what it is.
2359980	2361380	Spencer, do you have a take on nuclear subs?
2361380	2362820	I saw you kind of light up over there.
2362820	2366700	Oh, I mean, they're not really nuclear, it's a common misconception.
2366700	2369460	See, he wouldn't hold back.
2369460	2371340	They run on a nuclear fuel source, don't they?
2371340	2374540	Well, they run on a nucleated fuel source.
2374540	2375980	What's the difference, Spencer Crittenden?
2375980	2378460	It's a word, nucleated, did you just make that up?
2378460	2379460	Yeah, I did.
2379460	2384460	I've never heard that before.
2384460	2385460	Guys, I mean.
2385460	2386460	I was intrigued.
2386460	2388180	I was like, oh my God, my vocabulary.
2388180	2391980	I want to go get a muffin with you guys so bad.
2391980	2394260	We haven't been the last few times.
2394260	2395260	We haven't been.
2395260	2397860	There's also a zany candy shop right next door.
2397860	2399180	Yeah, Rocket Fizz.
2399180	2402620	Yeah, it's like got crazy things like candy from the 70s.
2402620	2404060	It's probably been there since the 70s.
2404060	2405060	It's, yeah.
2405660	2406660	I'm jealous too now.
2406660	2407660	I don't know if you are.
2407660	2409500	I don't like anything that's going on up here.
2409500	2410700	It's not very often.
2410700	2412460	I mean, we just played Magic today.
2412460	2413460	It was fun.
2413460	2414460	For like six hours, right?
2414460	2415460	It was about three hours.
2415460	2418460	No, I fucking couldn't play that game until the cows come home.
2418460	2419460	It's fun.
2419460	2420460	It's a great game, Magic.
2420460	2421460	Yeah, it's so nerdy.
2421460	2424700	Abed, you were saying backstage that you felt a little guilty because you attacked Spencer
2424700	2426940	and you felt like he didn't take it well, but you said that's part of it.
2426940	2430940	Oh yeah, well, because when we play Magic, this is going to bore anyone here that doesn't
2430940	2431940	play Magic.
2431940	2432940	I doubt it.
2432940	2436820	Much like this guy's Minecraft obsession, like I played Magic when I was in high school.
2436820	2437820	I really liked it.
2437820	2438820	I was really good at it.
2438820	2440060	And then I'd put it away for a while.
2440060	2444500	And then every once in a while I'll meet someone that wants to play and then my deck is still
2444500	2445500	sitting there.
2445500	2447780	So I'm like, all right, might as well dust this off.
2447780	2452580	And we played and like, I noticed something that when we play in a group, if like, let's
2452580	2457260	say I attack Spencer, he's going to feel like, oh man, are you pissed off him or something?
2457260	2458260	I'll just be enraged.
2458260	2459260	Yeah.
2459260	2460260	It's like, it's mad.
2460260	2462780	And it's like, it's not, it's not personal, dude.
2462780	2463780	It's a game.
2463780	2464780	It's personal.
2464780	2468820	This guy's amassing a crazy army, I have to stop it.
2468820	2471620	It's like nothing to do with me liking or not liking Spencer.
2471620	2474660	And then like, no matter what, he'll get mad just like, all right, now I'm going to really
2474660	2475660	fuck him up.
2475660	2476820	And he like does.
2476820	2479380	We play in these big groups and it's all political.
2479380	2484140	So like I, I become a, you know, a character, I tell people what to do and like try and
2484140	2487980	get people to do things that benefit me because it's a big part of it.
2487980	2488980	Yeah.
2488980	2490980	He's like kind of like the puppet master and he watches you dance.
2490980	2491980	I don't know the game.
2491980	2492980	Is there a dungeon master?
2492980	2493980	Is everybody a player?
2493980	2497460	No, you're all playing the same game, but you know, in theory it's like you're all fighting.
2497460	2501020	So if I was like, Hey man, it'd be better if you punched him in the face here and then
2501020	2502460	I could kick him in the leg.
2502460	2506260	It's kind of like that where it's like, if you do this here, that'll help me out.
2506260	2509340	But I'm trying to convince you why I would help you out to imagine if you could be as
2509340	2514420	violent as possible with spells and creatures, but no, like there's no drawbacks.
2514420	2516060	Like no one's going to put you in jail.
2516060	2518320	I mean, that's where this guy shines.
2518320	2523240	He comes through like a fucking zenith and he's just like crazy zenith, um, a phoenix
2523240	2527240	and then he just like just destroys and it takes everyone apart.
2527240	2529480	It's, he beat me with like 900 points.
2529480	2530480	I dealt 900.
2530480	2531480	Yeah.
2531480	2537120	And I'm like, I'd have to be playing this game for 70 hours to get 900 points.
2537120	2539640	Normally you do 20 damage to kill someone as well.
2539640	2540640	Yeah, I know.
2540640	2542640	I want to go to the bakery part, not the magic part.
2542640	2548280	Well, the bakery part's like, I just, I just, I, I, I just had lost time.
2549280	2559400	Like on X-Files, like I, the clock just changed from eight 39 to eight 49.
2559400	2565840	That conversation proves there's a paranormal force in the world.
2565840	2566840	It's a paranormal.
2566840	2569440	It's, it's, it's, it's evidence of, of the unknown.
2569440	2570440	Yeah.
2570440	2571440	Evidence of the paranormal.
2571440	2572440	That are normal.
2572440	2581400	Uh, no, they'd be more like a pair of Normans that are mall, like bad, but what do you,
2581400	2582920	I can't, I can't get out of that one.
2582920	2588160	What do you think is the worst, if you, if you know, if you don't want to answer, don't
2588160	2591880	because I mean, oh, you mean the game again, where I try not to answer?
2591880	2592880	No, no, no, no, no.
2592880	2594880	I'm going into my in depth interview.
2594880	2596440	Uh, oh, oh, all right.
2596440	2598240	I'll put on my Larry King answering hat.
2598240	2601320	What do you think the worst thing you've ever done?
2601560	2602560	Oh, the worst thing.
2602560	2604280	Another person is another person.
2604280	2605680	Oh my God.
2605680	2610120	One thing comes to mind, but it's not, it's not that bad because I had it done back to
2610120	2611120	me.
2611120	2613040	So does that cancel it out?
2613040	2614040	I don't know.
2614040	2620880	Is it just a pillow fight or, uh, I want to say, you got to tell us about it.
2620880	2622760	It sucks to admit this because it's fucked up.
2622760	2623760	Good.
2623760	2624760	But I was like, I can't remember.
2624760	2626760	Well, God, there's two things.
2626760	2628440	What's the worst?
2628440	2629440	Say the worst.
2629440	2630440	Start with the better one.
2630560	2631560	Okay.
2631560	2636960	The better one is like I peed in a cup and then I put it in the freezer and it was nice
2636960	2637960	and cold.
2637960	2638960	Cause I figured coldness will detect.
2638960	2642840	It won't be able to detect its piss and I mixed it with like a little bit of country
2642840	2643840	time.
2643840	2645480	When you say heat, who's the target on this one?
2645480	2646480	Oh, my cousin.
2646480	2647960	I can't remember what he did to me.
2647960	2653200	And then, and then I served it to him just like, oh my God, it's so hot outside, dude,
2653200	2654200	have some lemonade.
2654200	2658080	And first of all, did you put any lemonade in it or was it just key?
2658080	2659640	I was trying to like mask the taste.
2659840	2661600	So you put like powdered country time.
2661600	2664360	No, no, the kind in the can, I think, or whatever it was.
2664360	2668080	You mixed your pee, your refrigerated pee with lemonade.
2668080	2669080	What else?
2669080	2670880	And served it to your cousin on a hot day.
2670880	2673760	I want fucking horrible.
2673760	2675760	I want to hit pause.
2675760	2678280	Spencer, Spencer, at what temperature does pee freeze?
2678280	2681400	Oh, that'd be a 32 degrees Celsius.
2681400	2682400	Wow.
2682400	2683400	How does it feel like that?
2683400	2684400	Celsius.
2684400	2685400	Yeah.
2685400	2686400	Wow.
2686400	2687400	I just think all it up.
2687400	2688400	It's just all made up.
2688400	2689400	I think at the temperature the pee boils at.
2689560	2690560	All right.
2690560	2691560	So what happened with your cousin?
2691560	2692560	Did he drink the pee?
2692560	2693560	Yeah.
2693560	2695560	I mean, like, well, I was shocked, first of all, that because I was so scared.
2695560	2699560	I'm like, he's not just going to accept a glass of lemonade out of the blue.
2699560	2701560	I'm just standing right there like, have some lemonade.
2701560	2705120	And it's like, wait a minute, you're giving me lemonade.
2705120	2711800	Like I would be suspicious, but he was just like, oh, yeah, said I have this feeling in
2711800	2717280	my, in my mind of like success, but failure because it's like, it's like, it's like, you're
2717280	2722080	telling me that if someone offered you a glass of lemonade, your first thought would
2722080	2724480	be, this might be his pee.
2724480	2725480	And yet.
2725480	2726480	Yeah, of course.
2726480	2727840	No one just offers you lemonade.
2727840	2732480	And yet when Justin told you famously once that Lindsay Lohan was coming over to his
2732480	2736880	apartment so you should clean up and get a six pack of beer.
2736880	2737880	You did it.
2737880	2738880	When was that?
2738880	2739880	When was that?
2739880	2740880	I don't remember that.
2740880	2741880	This is years ago.
2741880	2742880	I don't remember that.
2742880	2744480	But I'm saying you are, you are famously gullible.
2744480	2747040	I've never been that amazed by Lindsay Lohan.
2747040	2748040	So I question.
2748040	2750280	Well, I don't think that you were like, I'm your biggest fan, but you were like, she's
2750280	2751280	a celebrity.
2751280	2752280	I should clean up.
2752280	2753280	Maybe it was like Mandy Moore and her Hayden.
2753280	2754920	I'd be like, oh yeah, I'm over there.
2754920	2755920	Holy shit.
2755920	2756920	You're famously gullible.
2756920	2757920	Yeah, I know.
2757920	2758920	But I don't.
2758920	2759920	Well, whatever.
2759920	2763720	No, but look, see, this is, this is like one of those things where it's a learning lesson
2763720	2768360	because you're like, oh man, I got to do this just because I can do it.
2768360	2771280	But then you're like later going like, what did this serve?
2771280	2772280	This served?
2772280	2773280	No, no point.
2773720	2782440	You didn't tell him and he didn't notice later after he drank the whole thing, he sucked
2782440	2784360	it down like it was like his own piss.
2784360	2787360	He didn't give a fuck.
2787360	2788360	Wait a second.
2788360	2789360	And like it was Waterworld.
2789360	2790360	Right.
2790360	2791360	Yeah.
2791360	2792360	Like Dennis Uppern Waterworld.
2792360	2797880	He's like, take us, take us through the denouement.
2797880	2800760	He brings the cup up to his mouth and what, and what happens next?
2800760	2801960	He drank the whole thing.
2802720	2803720	He guzzled down the alps.
2803720	2805120	He took a couple of sips and then he was.
2805120	2806560	Like it was his own piss.
2806560	2812520	He was enjoying it as though he had just poured himself an ice cold glass of his own urine.
2812520	2816360	I was like watching it and it was like, it was like fascination and horror because I'm
2816360	2817360	like.
2817360	2821480	You would have thought it was the guy's own urine the way he guzzled it.
2821480	2824240	I had not.
2824240	2827200	He didn't detect anything was wrong with, with the lemonade.
2827200	2829040	He just drank it a couple times.
2829040	2831920	How much, how much lemonade, what was the ratio of the real lemonade?
2832880	2833880	It must have been a lot.
2833880	2834880	It's probably like this much pee.
2834880	2838040	He's holding up a solo cup with like two fingers of pee.
2838040	2839040	Two fingers of pee.
2839040	2840040	Two fingers of pee.
2840040	2841040	I was peeing the cup.
2841040	2842040	I was like, oh, I don't want it to be too full.
2842040	2846320	And then I had to like move aside and I got to pee that much.
2846320	2847320	And then.
2847320	2848320	And then you top, you topped it off.
2848320	2850920	So it was, it was what, like 60, 70% lemonade.
2850920	2853320	I would say like 70% lemonade.
2853320	2859360	Just, just a, just that whisper of, whisper of your suggestion of strangers piss.
2859360	2860360	All right.
2860800	2863360	I would love a lemonade with suggestion of piss.
2863360	2864360	So he gets through it.
2864360	2868240	Does he ever go like, that's the best, that's terrible lemonade.
2868240	2873520	No, I think he drinks it and because there's like the ratios over, you know, more lemonade
2873520	2876080	than piss, he can taste more of the lemonade.
2876080	2879760	So he's kind of like, he's like, it looks like he's going to freak out, but he does
2879760	2881480	it because I'm on like pins and needles.
2881480	2882480	I'm like, yeah.
2882480	2883480	Oh shit.
2883480	2884480	And then it's like, he doesn't know.
2884480	2889200	And I'm like, you get away with it and you're like, fuck, I feel horrible.
2889200	2892560	You know, it's like, I won, but I don't feel like I won.
2892560	2894440	I feel like I really did something bad.
2894440	2895440	Did you ever tell him?
2895440	2896840	Or is he going to find out by listening?
2896840	2899040	No, no, he didn't, nothing happened.
2899040	2903080	And then like later I told him and then he freaked out, just like, how could you do that?
2903080	2904600	Oh, I mean, rightly so.
2904600	2905600	I mean, rightfully.
2905600	2908320	So it's like, I didn't ask for the worst thing.
2908320	2909320	Yeah.
2909320	2914320	But I was like, I told him, I was like, I can't believe you couldn't tell like, shame
2914320	2915320	on you.
2915320	2916320	Yeah.
2916320	2917320	Like, holy shit.
2917320	2918400	I was waiting for you to kind of like figure it out.
2918400	2923400	Like, is it possible that you drank it like it was, is it possible that your, that your
2923400	2927560	piss is delicious, that it's not too tart, not too sweet?
2927560	2938160	It's like a 12 year old boy, maybe, but not now, I was like ripe and no alcohol, I connected
2938160	2939160	different dots.
2939160	2947760	Is it the tangy taste of Flintstones vitamins, maybe a little bit of Centrum to throw it
2948600	2954760	on those crazy weekends, you're like, I'm going to have a Centrum, you know, grandpa's
2954760	2955760	away.
2955760	2956760	Yeah.
2956760	2963760	They're at the park, Centrum, you eat like seven, what was it, what was the, was that,
2963760	2965600	was that, was that, was that there were two things.
2965600	2966600	Was that worse than the second thing?
2966600	2967600	Yeah.
2967600	2968600	I think that is worse.
2968600	2972160	Just because when I was doing it, I was feeling so guilty.
2972160	2976480	But the other time was like, the worst thing is when he peed in his brother's pee because
2976480	2980240	his brother loves to drink his own pee.
2980240	2984000	It's one thing to spike country time lemonade, but, yeah, spike brother's pee, they're going
2984000	2985000	to know.
2985000	2986000	I mean, yeah.
2986000	2987000	All brother's pee.
2987000	2988000	All right.
2988000	2989000	Sorry.
2989000	2990000	Go ahead.
2990000	2992720	It's like, but this is the one that it happened to me later in life, which, deservedly so,
2992720	2996440	I couldn't get mad because I was like, well, I did do that to somebody.
2996440	2999520	And anyway, I did this to my brother.
2999520	3005240	I took, I took like cayenne pepper and I put it in water and then I put it in a super sober
3005240	3009000	and then I went up to him and squirted his eyes.
3009000	3010000	I think that's worse.
3010000	3011000	In a way.
3011000	3012000	Yeah, that's pretty bad.
3012000	3013000	I know.
3013000	3014000	I think he was like screaming.
3014000	3015000	I think that's called.
3015000	3017560	I think it's called aggravated assault.
3017560	3022920	Well, it was so, it was so evil and rotten and I remember my mom being like, who are
3022920	3023920	you?
3023920	3024920	Who does that?
3024920	3027400	Are you like a Bond supervillain?
3027400	3030440	Like, you know, like that's like not like you.
3030440	3031440	You're not evil.
3031440	3033000	You're not manipulative and crazy.
3033000	3034600	Like, I'm like, I don't know.
3034600	3036040	I mean, sometimes you get mad.
3036040	3039320	You just got to strike out and then strike back.
3039320	3044440	And then what happened was later in life, I was hanging out with Justin, right?
3044440	3045760	And I fell asleep at his house.
3045760	3050280	And of course, when you hang out with Justin and he's like, whoo, in one of his moods,
3050280	3051280	he doesn't want you to fall asleep.
3051280	3053140	He needs a partner in crime.
3053140	3058680	So he got so mad that I fell asleep that he wakes me up and then he just dumps like water
3058680	3063400	with cayenne pepper in my eyes, you know, like, just like wake up, wake up.
3064120	3066800	Wait, did he do that because he knows that you had done that?
3066800	3067800	No, no, no, no.
3067800	3068800	I think I told him later.
3068800	3069800	Really?
3069800	3070800	Yeah.
3070800	3072800	Because I said, like, I was like, you know, I didn't really get that mad because I kind
3072800	3073800	of deserved it.
3073800	3074800	Right.
3074800	3075800	And he was like, he was like, Oh, no shit.
3075800	3077800	And then I told him the story.
3077800	3083080	And anyway, but what's crazy is like, I just remember, like, I think I was in a dream and
3083080	3086440	then I just woke up to like instant pain and blindness.
3086440	3090760	If you jump cayenne pepper water on somebody while they're sleeping, you better be certain
3090760	3092200	they're not going to murder you after that.
3092200	3096800	No, I was like, I felt it was a nightmare because I was in so much pain, but I was like,
3096800	3097800	what's happening?
3097800	3098800	Like, like, where am I?
3098800	3102240	Like, I was at a slumber party one time when a girl stepped in my hand and I just asleep
3102240	3104360	punched her and knocked her out.
3104360	3107240	Somebody fucking actually abused me while I was asleep.
3107240	3108440	I fucking it would be murder.
3108440	3111040	Wait, she just woke you up like I was sleeping.
3111040	3112040	She was trying to go to the kitchen.
3112040	3114720	It was in college and people were all laying all over the, all over the floor.
3114720	3115720	Oh, yeah.
3115720	3116720	Like in 16.
3116720	3117720	And it was exactly.
3117720	3121080	And, and she, someone just walked and like stepped on my wrist.
3121600	3122600	Oh, I hate when that happens.
3122600	3123600	Bang.
3123600	3124600	It really hurt her.
3124600	3125600	Oh, my God.
3125600	3126600	You were late.
3126600	3127600	Did you punch her in the vagina?
3127600	3128600	You're laying down.
3128600	3131720	She was kind of crawling and I socked her in the head.
3131720	3132720	Oh, she was crawling.
3132720	3133720	Right.
3133720	3134720	Right in the temple.
3134720	3135720	You haven't a dream about.
3135720	3136720	What the fuck?
3136720	3137720	I'm like, what's happening?
3137720	3138720	I don't know what's going on.
3138720	3139720	I'm asleep.
3139720	3144000	Somebody's standing above me laughing, pouring fucking was like King Hippo.
3144000	3147480	And then he like, he like punches him in the dream and he wakes up and it's like a girl.
3147480	3148480	No.
3148840	3153280	I have a big collection of my friends when they pass out at parties.
3153280	3155120	I will put things on them.
3155120	3156120	But it's all stuff.
3156120	3157120	If they wake up, it comes off.
3157120	3158120	Like no, no ink.
3158120	3159480	Like no, like in like Sharpie markers.
3159480	3160480	Yeah.
3160480	3161480	Like no fucking can pepper.
3161480	3163320	But I'll put signs on them, right?
3163320	3166880	I covered Dan and post-it notes one time and you're a little post-it monster.
3166880	3170520	Me and Justin once drew like a penis on a girl's face.
3170520	3171520	And that was funny.
3171520	3172520	Cause that's like harmless.
3172520	3175400	You know, it was with a Sharpie, but.
3175400	3179680	The best photo I've ever taken was when Jay Johnson passed out and I, I made a duct tape.
3179680	3183640	I took some duct tape and a Sharpie marker made a mustache that he had like a nice big
3183640	3186080	handlebar mustache made on a duct tape.
3186080	3189280	And then this girl whose house we're at, she had bought like Playboy bunny ears.
3189280	3191120	So I put those on his head.
3191120	3193920	And what the amazing thing was you couldn't wake Jay up.
3193920	3195200	You didn't have to tiptoe around.
3195200	3196200	You could speak full voiced.
3196200	3197200	Yeah.
3197200	3198200	He said, Henry, let's pay my bunny ears.
3198200	3199200	Like, give me those.
3199200	3200200	Because we had put a million.
3200200	3201520	I'm so jealous of those kind of sleepers.
3201520	3204600	I had him dressed up as a full, like as an old lady, like he looked like a Monty Python
3204600	3207160	old lady and he had like a thousand pieces of clothes on.
3207160	3209680	He was just never moved a muscle.
3209680	3210880	And then I made a big sign.
3210880	3213720	He had the Playboy bunny ears on and I just made a sign around his neck.
3213720	3217320	I said racist.
3217320	3218320	That's amazing.
3218320	3219320	It's a great picture.
3219320	3221320	I have that on my phone.
3221320	3222320	It's pretty amazing.
3222320	3224800	He asked me to remove it from my phone and said, but can I keep it?
3224800	3226720	Because you can keep it, but you can't show it to people.
3226720	3227720	I have it on my phone.
3227720	3231480	You have it on your phone, but I don't show it to anybody.
3231480	3232480	No.
3233360	3235240	I mean, maybe you do, but we don't know.
3235240	3236560	You showed it to Jay, though, right?
3236560	3237560	I know.
3237560	3238560	I wouldn't.
3238560	3239560	He would pound me into the earth.
3239560	3243040	If you're on your death bed, it's totally like fine.
3243040	3246080	The reason Jay let me keep it, because even he agreed, it's a very good picture.
3246080	3247080	Yeah.
3247080	3248080	I mean, it would have been a crime to delete that thing.
3248080	3252120	Or if you're about to go on a coma, you'll be like, dude, before this coma, got to see
3252120	3253120	this picture.
3253120	3254120	Dog.
3254120	3255120	All right.
3255120	3256960	I got to tell you one thing.
3256960	3261760	So Justin did that to me and then his mom made him feel bad.
3262520	3267080	He was fine with it until she's like, how could you do that to your friend?
3267080	3270200	I feel like I'm watching a stand-up show on Nickelodeon.
3270200	3271200	All right.
3271200	3275200	That's like, well, dude, that's our lives together, man.
3275200	3276200	I met him.
3276200	3277200	I'm like, man, you're like a fucking Nickelodeon.
3277200	3280200	You ever been sleeping over at a friend's house?
3280200	3282200	They do some shit.
3282200	3285200	Then they mom get mad?
3285200	3287200	Yeah, dog.
3287200	3289200	I didn't do nothing.
3289200	3291200	She's like, what are you doing?
3291200	3292200	I don't know.
3292200	3293200	I'm not.
3293200	3294200	She's not my mom.
3294200	3295200	We'll be right back.
3295200	3296200	It's like some cheating and chaos.
3296200	3297200	You know what I'm saying?
3297200	3298200	You said three quarters of the N-word.
3298200	3299200	I know.
3299200	3300200	No, I mean Nickelodeon.
3300200	3301200	Oh, Nickelodeon.
3301200	3302200	Okay.
3302200	3303200	Were you doing Nickelodeon?
3303200	3304200	Is that what he said?
3304200	3305200	Did I say that or was I repeating somebody else saying Nickelodeon?
3305200	3306200	All right.
3306200	3307200	All right.
3307200	3308200	Hey, man.
3308200	3320200	If that's not the title of this episode, I'll eat my fucking hat.
3320200	3321200	It better be Nickelodeon.
3321200	3322200	You have to name it that, dude.
3322200	3325200	He's going to eat a hat.
3325200	3329200	Let's all protect ourselves and make him feel awkward by bringing up Demorj Brown.
3329200	3334200	Do I read down like Letterman?
3334200	3336200	No, don't move down.
3336200	3337200	Just behave yourself.
3337200	3338200	All right.
3338200	3339200	Hello, Demorj.
3339200	3344200	I haven't heard word at all.
3345200	3353200	Yeah, I brought you up because one time you substituted for Aaron when we played D&D.
3353200	3354200	I thought it went quite well.
3354200	3355200	Oh, thank you very much.
3355200	3356200	Yeah.
3356200	3357200	Yeah.
3357200	3358200	That's what I do.
3358200	3359200	I judge.
3359200	3360200	I sit and then judge.
3360200	3363200	Who did well in D&D this week?
3363200	3365200	You judged D and D.
3365200	3368200	I mean, you're going to...
3368200	3371200	No, I had to get that one out.
3371200	3372200	Right.
3373200	3376200	You can't sit on that fucking...
3376200	3378200	fucking ingot of gold on that one.
3378200	3379200	It was a two-parter.
3379200	3380200	It was a D&D.
3380200	3381200	Don't keep your light under a bushel.
3381200	3383200	You're judged D, D&D.
3383200	3385200	Do you like Judge Judy?
3385200	3386200	Judge Dredd?
3386200	3388200	Yeah, I like Judge Dredd, but he's in a hurry.
3388200	3389200	He's like Judge D.
3389200	3391200	I got to get on the house right now.
3391200	3393200	It's the same amount of syllables.
3393200	3395200	All right.
3395200	3396200	Wow.
3396200	3399200	Everyone's like so fast these days, they got to zip through words.
3399200	3400200	I know.
3400200	3401200	Sorry.
3401200	3404200	What are a couple of old fellas like I was supposed to do in this world?
3404200	3405200	I know.
3405200	3407200	I'm just saying you're pronouncing shit.
3407200	3409200	What's going to happen when you get old and cranky?
3409200	3410200	Oh, God.
3410200	3411200	Who knows?
3411200	3414200	I'll get taken down like a fucking wild deer.
3414200	3416200	I think you'll be like a crazy...
3416200	3417200	I don't even know what that means.
3417200	3419200	You'll be like the guy that...
3419200	3421200	You'll be the get-off-my-lawn guy.
3421200	3423200	Yeah, get-off-my-lawn, you rotten kids.
3423200	3424200	Jesus.
3424200	3425200	My heart?
3425200	3426200	Not like that.
3426200	3427200	You'll be for real.
3427200	3430200	You'll be yourself, and you'll be all frantic, and you'll be not wanting them on your lawn.
3430200	3433200	I see him more as a get-on-my-lawn kind of guy.
3433200	3435200	Just like, kids, get on my lawn!
3435200	3438200	Don't go by that guy's house.
3438200	3439200	His house, yeah.
3439200	3441200	He wants you on his lawn.
3441200	3442200	I see.
3442200	3444200	Don't go past old man Abbott's house.
3444200	3447200	He'll come out and watch your windshield.
3447200	3448200	I like that me and Damore's...
3448200	3449200	You're probably always out.
3449200	3451200	You're just always out on your front lawn looking for kids.
3451200	3453200	Yeah, I'm always because it's like, man, it's so boring in there.
3453200	3455200	What's going on out in this world?
3455200	3457200	Whoa, kids coming by?
3457200	3458200	You're going to make them watch Farscape.
3458200	3461200	Or Frisbee went over to the fence into old man Gates' house.
3461200	3462200	Oh, man, don't go in there.
3462200	3464200	Last time I went there, he burned me a CD.
3468200	3469200	It's pretty good.
3469200	3472200	It took like three hours.
3472200	3475200	I had to hear about all the track information, and it was fucking...
3475200	3477200	Burned me a CD, and then downloaded all of Farscape.
3477200	3479200	Yeah, yeah.
3479200	3481200	I'd sit him through like five...
3481200	3484200	Wait, okay, first five episodes, come on, but we'll get through seven.
3484200	3485200	This is how we met.
3486200	3488200	You actually gave me Darkplace.
3488200	3493200	Well, I gave it to Dan, but you were in the office, and you said, can I take this?
3493200	3495200	And then you said, in return, I'll give you Farscape.
3495200	3497200	And I said, I don't know where that is.
3497200	3500200	And then I lost three months of my life sitting on a couch.
3500200	3502200	I still need a copy of Darkplace.
3502200	3503200	I put it on your desk.
3503200	3505200	You still have the same copy.
3505200	3507200	That was a copy that Bill Hader gave me.
3507200	3508200	Oh, really?
3508200	3509200	Yeah.
3509200	3510200	Wow, that's amazing.
3510200	3511200	No, I didn't take it.
3511200	3513200	You said, all right, you can borrow it.
3514200	3517200	And then a year later, you said, I still have your copy.
3517200	3518200	It's in the truck.
3518200	3519200	It was an 80s truck.
3519200	3520200	Oh, it was.
3520200	3521200	That big fish.
3521200	3522200	Now time just passed for me.
3524200	3525200	Cock-a-doodle-doo.
3525200	3527200	It's just a regular old podcast.
3527200	3528200	I have a...
3528200	3529200	My wife and his friends.
3529200	3530200	I actually have a George Takei story.
3530200	3532200	Hey, who borrowed my hoe?
3533200	3534200	I know my garden hoe.
3534200	3536200	I gave it to you the other day.
3538200	3540200	Jim Orge, you said you had a George Takei story?
3540200	3541200	Barely.
3541200	3542200	It's me and Josh Fatum, actually.
3542200	3545200	And we went to get sushi in Little Tokyo at a place called Frying Fish,
3545200	3546200	which is a carousel...
3546200	3547200	Frying Fish?
3547200	3548200	Yeah, it's a syrup.
3548200	3549200	What?
3549200	3550200	Give it up for Frying Fish, yo.
3550200	3551200	That's it.
3551200	3552200	That's it.
3552200	3553200	I understand.
3553200	3554200	Someone's got to represent.
3554200	3555200	Jim Orge is up here now.
3555200	3556200	Okay.
3557200	3558200	But I bet it is, too.
3558200	3559200	Let's be a little bit better.
3559200	3561200	Imagine that you did move down the couch.
3561200	3563200	Oh, like mentally.
3563200	3565200	Yeah, like mentally moved down the couch.
3566200	3568200	I'm going to watch that happen.
3568200	3569200	Yeah, no.
3569200	3570200	Crap.
3570200	3571200	Okay, just half.
3571200	3573200	And we're sitting at two chairs next to each other.
3573200	3575200	I'm with Josh Fatum.
3575200	3577200	The stools are very close together.
3577200	3579200	They're very small, so you can't even keep things in your pockets.
3579200	3580200	My phone's out.
3580200	3581200	My notebook's out.
3581200	3584200	And we're well into this sushi thing.
3584200	3587200	I'm eating some kind of dragon surprise shit.
3587200	3589200	That's just pee.
3589200	3590200	Yeah.
3590200	3592200	With a tiny bit of green tea.
3592200	3595200	And my phone goes off.
3595200	3597200	It's a text.
3597200	3598200	I look at it.
3598200	3602200	It's from Josh, who is sitting next to me.
3602200	3604200	So I furl my brow like this.
3604200	3606200	And I'm like, this fucking better be good.
3606200	3607200	And I open it.
3607200	3610200	And it says, Sulu.
3610200	3613200	And I've just been cranking this in the second half just,
3613200	3614200	what the fuck?
3614200	3615200	And I look up.
3615200	3617200	And as I look up, I see Takai.
3617200	3619200	And I go, Sulu!
3620200	3621200	She!
3621200	3622200	And he's staring right at us.
3622200	3623200	And then he just smiles.
3623200	3625200	And he goes, mmm.
3626200	3627200	Hey, can I replicate his laugh?
3627200	3628200	That's his story.
3628200	3631200	It's like, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3631200	3632200	He laughs like the camera.
3632200	3633200	He's Mr. Magoo?
3633200	3638200	No, it's like, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3638200	3639200	He laughs like the camera.
3639200	3640200	It's cool, though.
3640200	3641200	It's cool laugh.
3641200	3643200	You laugh like that, right?
3644200	3645200	Yes.
3645200	3646200	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3646200	3647200	It's like that kind of laugh.
3647200	3648200	Who was that?
3648200	3649200	Yeah.
3649200	3650200	He had a skip in his throat.
3650200	3653200	What is it that happens to you when you come on stage?
3653200	3654200	Yeah.
3654200	3655200	Are you thinking, like, I got a...
3655200	3656200	Like, you kind of...
3656200	3657200	You remind me of Fauzi Bear.
3657200	3658200	Like, like...
3658200	3659200	You said that before.
3659200	3660200	You said that before.
3660200	3661200	Yeah.
3661200	3662200	No.
3662200	3663200	You're kind of like...
3663200	3664200	Like, the show must go on.
3664200	3665200	Like, you really...
3665200	3666200	Well, no.
3666200	3668200	I mean, he's a showman, Dan.
3668200	3669200	He's a showman.
3669200	3670200	How does Fauzi Bear laugh?
3671200	3672200	Oh, Kermit.
3672200	3673200	Wait, it's like...
3674200	3675200	It's like, walk it, walk it.
3675200	3677200	No, that's all the family.
3677200	3683200	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3683200	3685200	Oh, Kermit, you're so funny.
3685200	3687200	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
3687200	3688200	That's so funny.
3688200	3689200	I love so funny.
3689200	3690200	Will somebody give me a favor online
3690200	3692200	when this podcast drops?
3692200	3696200	Play that against Fauzi Bear.
3696200	3697200	Let's see how accurate that is.
3697200	3699200	That is a walk, walk, walker.
3699200	3701200	That's not a laugh, it's like, just...
3701200	3704200	I've been, give me some Miss Piggy.
3704200	3706200	Oh, Kermit, what?
3706200	3707200	I really love you.
3707200	3709200	That's actually quite good.
3709200	3710200	Alright.
3710200	3711200	Hiyah.
3712200	3714200	Give me some Swedish Chef.
3714200	3716200	Dortadorable.
3716200	3718200	That was easy, that was easy.
3718200	3720200	Give me some Roosevelt Franklin.
3720200	3721200	Which one is he again or her?
3721200	3722200	Exactly.
3722200	3724200	Nobody knows who Roosevelt Franklin is.
3724200	3725200	I can do the fish guy.
3725200	3728200	He's the Franklin of Sesame Street.
3728200	3729200	I can do the fish guy.
3729200	3730200	The guy that throws fish.
3730200	3731200	What's his name?
3731200	3734200	He's like, whoa, whoa.
3734200	3735200	He's that guy.
3735200	3738200	Ah, but if I keep you up here...
3738200	3739200	Well, look, I'll behave.
3739200	3741200	I know where you're going with this.
3741200	3742200	I've known you a long time.
3742200	3744200	I can tell where you're going with this.
3744200	3750200	I mean, I actually feel like you might be good playing D&D.
3750200	3751200	I played before.
3751200	3752200	He'll be a good Christopher.
3752200	3755200	He's like a human road flare.
3755200	3759200	I don't know how to work him and I read the instructions
3759200	3764200	and I go, here's Abbott and then people are losing eyes and stuff.
3764200	3767200	Or it just doesn't work, it just lays there.
3768200	3771200	Demarj, did you play Mulrane or Christaberg last time you were here?
3771200	3772200	I forget.
3772200	3773200	I think he played Mulrane.
3773200	3775200	It was the Unicorn last time I was here.
3775200	3776200	Oh, so you had not played...
3776200	3779200	No, Demarj played Mulrane and Sonana.
3779200	3780200	Now Mulrane is gone.
3780200	3783200	We can cast whoever as Dignity.
3783200	3786200	I owned a guy last time that's Sunlady in red.
3786200	3788200	I would have Abbott play Christaberg, yes,
3788200	3791200	and have Demarj play...
3791200	3792200	Dignity Sarsguard.
3792200	3794200	Dignity Sarsguard.
3794200	3798200	Aaron committed Seppuku last time and reemerged as a new character
3798200	3800200	that sounds a lot like the old character.
3800200	3802200	She has a different name.
3802200	3804200	She didn't lose a step.
3804200	3806200	No.
3806200	3808200	Well, unicorns...
3808200	3809200	I'll stop.
3809200	3810200	Don't stop.
3810200	3812200	Yeah, what are unicorns?
3812200	3815200	Abbott, whenever you hesitate, hit the gas pedal.
3815200	3817200	Yeah, oh man.
3817200	3819200	I was watching Seinfeld.
3819200	3820200	I want the real deal.
3820200	3822200	I need an opposite George kind of thing.
3823200	3825200	I don't ever fucking bock up here.
3825200	3827200	I want you to fucking throw high and hard.
3827200	3832200	Well, I mean, unicorns, they have more than a step.
3832200	3834200	They have sort of a glide, right?
3834200	3836200	Yeah, I suppose.
3836200	3837200	You know that...
3837200	3840200	It's like you see them glide and then rainbow sprinkles
3840200	3842200	come from behind their hooves kind of thing.
3842200	3843200	That's how they move.
3843200	3844200	Is there anything...
3844200	3845200	I heard a...
3845200	3847200	I was listening to some podcast.
3847200	3850200	It was people talking about all the things that they...
3850200	3853200	They were personally humiliated to find out
3853200	3857200	they didn't know until they were much, much too old.
3857200	3860200	So one of the examples that that reminded me of
3860200	3862200	is there was a girl who was telling a story
3862200	3865200	of how she thought that unicorns were real animals
3865200	3867200	until she was like 30 at a party.
3867200	3869200	And it was like at a party
3869200	3871200	and people were talking about endangered animals
3871200	3873200	and she piped in with like,
3873200	3874200	what about unicorns?
3874200	3875200	Are they endangered?
3875200	3877200	And found out then...
3877200	3878200	What?
3878200	3880200	That she just thought that...
3880200	3882200	I so wish I was there. That's awesome.
3882200	3883200	But you know what?
3883200	3884200	That's the...
3884200	3886200	She had the best 30 years of anyone's life.
3886200	3887200	Well, that's... Yeah, that's a thing.
3887200	3888200	There's a lot of people, yeah.
3888200	3889200	Like, well, I mean...
3889200	3891200	I can't remember what the other examples were.
3891200	3893200	She didn't spend any of those 30 years seeking one out.
3893200	3894200	Like going to find...
3894200	3896200	Where would you see one?
3896200	3898200	She just figured that they were in Africa or something.
3898200	3899200	I don't know.
3899200	3902200	I don't know where she thought they were, but...
3902200	3903200	Whatever, rainbows.
3903200	3904200	That's fantastic.
3904200	3906200	I went to school with a girl who...
3906200	3908200	She was a new student when I was in ninth grade, I think,
3908200	3909200	or eighth grade, in ninth grade,
3909200	3913200	who failed her first exam because she was convinced
3913200	3917200	she had been taught, as her parents angrily stated later,
3917200	3919200	that the South had won the war.
3919200	3921200	Whoa!
3921200	3924200	She'd gone to an academy and they brought in like her work
3924200	3927200	and it was just a book that had rationalized the whole thing
3927200	3928200	and it created this whole...
3928200	3929200	This is where she had gone to school.
3929200	3932200	That's like evil Santa Claus line, you know?
3932200	3933200	One step, one step.
3933200	3936200	Santa Claus is bad, but that's fucking worse.
3936200	3937200	Wait.
3937200	3939200	Abed, go on.
3939200	3941200	You know what I'm saying?
3941200	3943200	You lie to a kid about Santa Claus.
3943200	3944200	We were talking about this.
3944200	3945200	It's kind of bad.
3945200	3946200	Oh.
3946200	3947200	Yeah, but we were, yeah.
3947200	3949200	But if you lie about that shit,
3949200	3952200	that's like fucking with a kid's sense of history.
3952200	3953200	That's bullshit.
3953200	3956200	I don't get the impression that they told the kid
3956200	3959200	the South won the war so that they would think
3959200	3962200	that they were living in a better world.
3962200	3963200	I think they...
3963200	3965200	Is that what it was?
3965200	3967200	She took this exam.
3967200	3969200	They made her take the test because she'd gotten there
3969200	3970200	on a Tuesday or something.
3970200	3971200	The test was on Friday.
3971200	3973200	So just to be part of the school.
3973200	3975200	And a lot of it was blue book stuff.
3975200	3978200	And I guess the teacher kind of was frazzled,
3978200	3979200	lost his head over the whole thing.
3979200	3980200	And on Monday just said,
3980200	3983200	I can't even give you a grade on this so you fail.
3983200	3986200	Because what are you even thinking?
3986200	3987200	These opinions don't...
3987200	3989200	Everything you have written is insane.
3989200	3991200	And she was in tears and went crazy.
3991200	3994200	And the parents came in to match for this conference.
3994200	3997200	And they went step by step trying to explain that
3997200	3999200	in their education this is what...
3999200	4002200	It goes back like farther.
4002200	4005200	She had a book, like the text that she had used
4005200	4009200	when she learned the history of the United States
4009200	4012200	editorially rationalized this sort of conclusion,
4012200	4015200	that that was why the flag was still flown down there
4015200	4016200	and that is why.
4016200	4017200	Her alphabet had three keys.
4017200	4019200	Oh my god, so it wasn't.
4020200	4022200	Her spelling books were like...
4022200	4025200	They showed black people as slaves still.
4025200	4027200	It was insane.
4027200	4029200	And so the parents' argument, apparently,
4029200	4031200	and I know this from teachers, I was on student council,
4031200	4034200	that apparently the parents' argument was that's up for debate.
4034200	4037200	It depends on how you define the woman.
4037200	4038200	What is winning?
4038200	4040200	Had to be there, had to be there.
4040200	4043200	Well, that's the point where it starts to actually get fascinated.
4043200	4045200	Because it's like, yeah, what the fuck?
4045200	4046200	What is it?
4047200	4050200	I think unconditional surrender of your army
4050200	4052200	and your ability to document.
4052200	4055200	They signed a surrender document, didn't they?
4055200	4057200	Yeah, they signed a whole lot of things.
4057200	4059200	Yes, but we're talking about two parents
4059200	4062200	who are saying this is why the flag is still flown
4062200	4064200	on our porch down here.
4064200	4066200	And they're saying we don't acknowledge
4066200	4067200	that surrender document.
4067200	4069200	Why isn't there a flag cop that shows up
4069200	4072200	and he's like, so you got the wrong flag,
4072200	4074200	you will take that, this is the right one.
4074200	4076200	Why isn't he in his job?
4076200	4078200	Then they sent her off and gave us back
4078200	4080200	an all new flag cop, chicken out Friday.
4082200	4084200	That decision is made at the state level.
4084200	4087200	What would the pilot for flag cop be?
4087200	4088200	The pilot?
4088200	4089200	The pilot.
4089200	4094200	We're a studio, you're pitching us your show flag cop.
4094200	4098200	I mean, flag cop, the first episode is like...
4098200	4099200	Who is flag cop?
4099200	4101200	I mean, he's a cop who has to see
4101200	4102200	if people have the right flag or not.
4103200	4104200	Don't take some in.
4104200	4105200	Okay, so what's the pilot?
4105200	4107200	Well, the pilot's like the first episode is like
4107200	4109200	his best friend from like childhood.
4109200	4111200	Still, like he said, was Ray's thinking
4111200	4112200	the south really happened.
4112200	4113200	I mean, the south won the war.
4113200	4114200	The south really.
4114200	4115200	So it's like...
4115200	4116200	It's still happening, baby.
4116200	4119200	Flag cop is like torn between two sides.
4119200	4120200	The south is still happening.
4120200	4121200	It's like my best friend,
4121200	4123200	but he goes against everything I believe.
4123200	4124200	What do I do?
4124200	4125200	So it's like this...
4125200	4129200	What's the season finale of flag cop?
4130200	4133200	Where he finds out that he was brainwashed as a kid
4133200	4135200	and that he actually does believe in the other flag.
4135200	4138200	So he has to like think, like everything I've been taught is a lie.
4138200	4139200	Oh, okay.
4139200	4140200	And then you're like...
4140200	4141200	So it's just...
4141200	4143200	Next season, was it really a lie
4143200	4145200	or was he tricked into thinking that?
4147200	4149200	Sounds about as good as most TV these days.
4149200	4150200	Yeah, I know.
4150200	4152200	Well, he didn't give me much to work with.
4152200	4153200	He gave me flag cop.
4153200	4154200	I thought flag cop...
4154200	4155200	I could see this on Netflix.
4155200	4156200	Yeah, I could watch it.
4156200	4158200	Could flag cop be into different flags?
4158200	4159200	So it's only about the north and the south.
4159200	4162200	Well, like in season two, he starts to go...
4162200	4165200	Well, the flag is kind of like cool,
4165200	4167200	but I like that design and the Brazil flag.
4167200	4169200	It looks like a cool globe.
4169200	4170200	It's all blue with stars.
4170200	4172200	And so he's like...
4172200	4174200	He falls in love with this Brazilian girl that's like...
4174200	4177200	She's really working for Brazil to kind of trick him,
4177200	4178200	but he doesn't know that.
4178200	4179200	So the whole season you think,
4179200	4180200	oh, he just found a girlfriend,
4180200	4183200	but like she's really against it, you know?
4183200	4185200	And the last episode we're like...
4185200	4187200	That sounds better than most TV.
4187200	4191200	It's probably first season is Confederate versus U.S. flag,
4191200	4194200	and it's like a really popular show, really critically lauded.
4194200	4198200	And then second season they do like the wire doing the stevedores,
4198200	4199200	you know?
4199200	4200200	He's right, he's right.
4200200	4203200	It's kind of like, oh, the wire can be about any kind of wire.
4203200	4205200	And then third season they're like,
4205200	4209200	okay, yeah, but seriously, how about those crack dealers?
4209200	4212200	So then third season we go back to his roots,
4212200	4214200	like who taught him about flags?
4214200	4215200	Okay.
4216200	4218200	When does the movie come out?
4218200	4220200	It's gonna be like season five.
4220200	4224200	There's a cool Emmy-nominated episode
4224200	4227200	where he's having a toxic reaction to his medication
4227200	4229200	and he meets Betsy Ross.
4231200	4234200	Well, it's like Betsy Ross is in his great-great-grandfather,
4234200	4235200	Dana, you see?
4235200	4239200	So like his great-great-great-grandfather was like her first lover,
4239200	4241200	but then she dumped him for George Washington.
4241200	4242200	Wait, no, wait.
4242200	4244200	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4244200	4246200	Fuck, me and my history bullshit.
4246200	4247200	Don't apologize, I mean.
4247200	4250200	Yeah, anyway, you know, Betsy Ross and him almost hooked up,
4250200	4253200	but then she like dumped him for this like brawn bones,
4253200	4255200	you know, sleepy hollow guy that's like,
4255200	4258200	and he like wins her over.
4258200	4260200	What does Flankop think of those parking lot guys
4260200	4263200	that are just waving orange flags that no loyalty?
4263200	4265200	No, it triggers this crazy like seizure where he's like...
4265200	4267200	They don't understand.
4267200	4269200	And he like goes into a seizure of like...
4269200	4270200	That's his kryptonite.
4270200	4271200	You know, like, yeah, it's like his kryptonite.
4271200	4272200	Like he can't see flags.
4272200	4274200	Yeah, you can just wave an orange flag and I'm in a hill.
4274200	4276200	Yeah, because he sees a flag trapped.
4276200	4278200	You know, like it's like, oh, I got to free that flag.
4278200	4281200	Is there a whole flag cop police department?
4281200	4284200	Like is he just one cop among many Flankops?
4284200	4285200	He is the department.
4285200	4287200	He's like the laughingstock of his department
4287200	4290200	because everyone's like, you're just investigating flags, man.
4290200	4292200	I wonder what it's like out there for Flankop.
4292200	4295200	He's like, hey, some shit goes down with flags too.
4295200	4298200	Kitchen-y flags today?
4298200	4301200	Hey, Murphy, Murphy, here comes Flankop.
4301200	4305200	Hey, my flag is billowing too much in the wind.
4305200	4308200	You want to fucking do something about that?
4308200	4311200	That's the pilot is the guys like getting made fun of like that.
4311200	4315200	And then a fucking senator is killed with a flag.
4315200	4319200	And the homicide department's like, fuck.
4319200	4320200	We have no...
4320200	4324200	I want these departments working together on this one.
4324200	4326200	This is a flag crime and a homicide.
4326200	4328200	It's finally Flankop's moment.
4328200	4330200	And he's like, I've been waiting for this my whole career.
4330200	4331200	Which flag was it?
4331200	4332200	I don't know.
4332200	4333200	I see some stars.
4333200	4335200	That's not specific enough.
4335200	4338200	There's stars in a million flags.
4338200	4339200	The knot's too tight.
4339200	4340200	Well, don't touch it.
4340200	4342200	There's evidence on it.
4342200	4344200	And the whole thing's about untying that knot.
4344200	4347200	You're untying the flag the whole season.
4347200	4349200	Don't let it touch the ground.
4349200	4351200	Yeah, you can't let it touch the ground either.
4351200	4354200	Because it might be an American flag.
4354200	4356200	He knows where it's been.
4356200	4358200	There's a bad guy who lives on a mountain.
4358200	4361200	He has a flag and he's slowly lowering it towards the ground.
4361200	4366200	And if you don't get there by the time the flag touches the ground,
4366200	4367200	he'll murder somebody.
4367200	4368200	No.
4368200	4370200	He won't murder somebody.
4370200	4372200	He keeps murdering people until you make him...
4372200	4376200	The reason they come up there is because the flag is going to touch the ground by the season.
4376200	4377200	He wants the flag to touch the ground?
4377200	4378200	No, no.
4378200	4380200	The bad guy is lowering it to the ground.
4380200	4383200	And Flankop has to keep it from touching the ground.
4383200	4384200	I don't know what the stakes are.
4384200	4385200	I just know.
4386200	4390200	Because you open the episode with Flankop like raising a flag,
4390200	4395200	and it's like he knows the time of when a flag has to hit the top and the bottom.
4395200	4396200	Yeah.
4396200	4397200	No one else would know that.
4397200	4398200	It's like 24.
4398200	4400200	It's a ticking clock thing with that guy.
4400200	4401200	Yeah.
4401200	4403200	It doesn't count down to a flag touching the ground.
4403200	4405200	How much time they have to save all the horses.
4405200	4408200	And he has to go through a series of puzzles to get to the flag.
4408200	4409200	Can I have you play by Christo?
4409200	4410200	Huh?
4410200	4411200	Can Christo play that guy?
4411200	4412200	I was just going to ask who's playing flag.
4412200	4413200	Or bad guy?
4413200	4414200	Christo.
4414200	4415200	Flankop.
4415200	4416200	Oh, Flankop?
4416200	4417200	Oh, sorry.
4417200	4418200	Sorry.
4418200	4419200	Flankop?
4419200	4420200	Flankop?
4420200	4421200	Flankop?
4421200	4422200	I've alerted that out of here.
4422200	4423200	I can't talk that.
4423200	4424200	Can we get Max?
4424200	4441200	Not at one day
4442200	4443200	Shit.
4445200	4447200	Fool, you fucked up again, Flankop.
4447200	4448200	Shit.
4448200	4450200	Get in my office.
4450200	4455200	I've never seen anybody earn so few stripes protecting stripes.
4457200	4458200	The irony.
4463200	4465200	Flankop, get the fuck out of here.
4465200	4467200	Don't do your job.
4467200	4468200	Flankop, shit.
4468200	4469200	What am I here for?
4469200	4470200	My health?
4470200	4471200	My health?
4471200	4472200	God damn it, Flankop.
4472200	4474200	And then halfway through the season at the vending machine.
4474200	4475200	I bet.
4475200	4476200	I bet.
4476200	4477200	You have to play Fiddy for this.
4477200	4478200	He'll be Ice-T and you're Fiddy.
4478200	4479200	You're Flankop.
4479200	4480200	Oh, sorry.
4480200	4484200	At the vending machine, I'm just describing an event that happens.
4484200	4485200	It's not.
4485200	4486200	Like.
4486200	4487200	Stage direction.
4487200	4491200	At the vending machine, Ice-T has been riding the guy for the whole season.
4491200	4492200	It's Ice-Q.
4492200	4494200	He's always riding him.
4494200	4495200	Oh, it's Ice-T?
4495200	4499200	And then he's putting some money in the vending machine and he drops his wallet and an old
4500200	4508200	ID falls out revealing that Ice-T when he got started was on the flag to permit.
4508200	4511200	That's why I ride you so hard.
4512200	4514200	Because I know you can do better.
4514200	4515200	That's brilliant.
4515200	4516200	That's brilliant.
4516200	4517200	I love it.
4517200	4518200	I love it.
4518200	4521200	And you got to work twice as hard when you are a Flankop.
4521200	4525200	Because all people see is a fucking Flankop.
4526200	4530200	It doesn't matter how good you are.
4530200	4531200	Shit.
4531200	4532200	Miranda rights.
4532200	4533200	Due process.
4533200	4534200	Quotas.
4534200	4537200	You can fuck all that.
4537200	4539200	Air, air, air, air.
4539200	4540200	Flankop.
4540200	4541200	Oh, sorry.
4541200	4543200	I thought that was the theme song.
4543200	4546200	There's an alarm going off at Flankop Central.
4546200	4547200	Oh, shit.
4547200	4548200	Flankop.
4548200	4549200	Oh, shit.
4549200	4551200	I better take care of that, boss.
4551200	4552200	Fuck.
4552200	4553200	You bet your ass you better take care of it.
4553200	4555200	Yo, am I going to get a raise, though?
4555200	4556200	For real.
4556200	4557200	I've been working so hard.
4557200	4559200	Man, the only thing that gets raised around here are flags.
4559200	4561200	Get the fuck out of there.
4562200	4564200	Don't do your job.
4571200	4572200	All right, Spencer.
4572200	4574200	Let's play some D&D, shall we?
4576200	4577200	Dan, if you would...
4577200	4579200	Fucking Flankop.
4579200	4580200	That's a show?
4580200	4582200	Flankop should be a show.
4583200	4585200	I would see the ad for it and be like,
4585200	4586200	that's a show?
4586200	4587200	Flankop?
4587200	4588200	I'll tell you what, I mean...
4588200	4590200	It's a Channel 101 show.
4590200	4592200	If Homeland can be in its sixth season...
4592200	4593200	What?
4593200	4594200	I haven't even watched it.
4594200	4595200	That show.
4595200	4596200	Terrorist, Senator.
4596200	4599200	That's basically 24, just from a different angle.
4599200	4600200	All right.
4600200	4601200	You're Christopher.
4601200	4602200	I'm Christopher.
4602200	4604200	Do I give you this?
4604200	4605200	Pass it down.
4605200	4607200	Keep your character and pass the others down.
4607200	4608200	Okay.
4608200	4609200	Of course.
4609200	4610200	Where am I?
4611200	4614200	These are all three pages, these are all dignity.
4614200	4615200	All right, let me see it.
4615200	4616200	Okay, sorry.
4616200	4617200	It's okay.
4617200	4619200	This is Quark, and he's only one page,
4619200	4620200	so I would assume one of those pages.
4620200	4621200	Give him.
4621200	4622200	That's Quark.
4622200	4624200	Pass this all the way down to Jeff.
4624200	4626200	We can edit this part out later, maybe?
4626200	4627200	I hope so.
4627200	4629200	Such lovely energy early on.
4629200	4630200	If you're listening at home, get up,
4630200	4632200	make yourself a nice cold beverage.
4632200	4633200	Jim Orange, that's you.
4633200	4635200	This show brought to you by P.
4636200	4638200	Who doesn't like a nice, distracting,
4638200	4640200	lemonade P cartoon?
4640200	4642200	Are you in the bathroom and you're wondering,
4642200	4643200	how do I get that?
4643200	4646200	Country time P tastes just like you or P.
4646200	4648200	I've ever taken a piss and wondered,
4648200	4650200	I want that in my body, back in.
4650200	4651200	I've never taken anything.
4651200	4652200	How do I do that?
4652200	4654200	Country time.
4654200	4656200	All right, are we good to go?
4656200	4657200	I think so.
4657200	4659200	Spencer, take us on a magic voyage.
4659200	4660200	Okay.
4665200	4667200	Last time on Harmon Town.
4667200	4670200	Our heroes were safe for the moment.
4670200	4673200	After losing Mulrain in combat and taking refuge
4673200	4678200	from Admiral Darkstar in the town of Rosebook,
4678200	4680200	our heroes rested in the Constabulary
4680200	4684200	with their new friend Dignity the Paladin.
4684200	4688200	Our heroes went to inspect the magical barrier defending the town
4688200	4690200	and ran into Father Tinder,
4690200	4693200	who was handing out juice to everyone.
4693200	4696200	After great internal turmoil, debate,
4696200	4698200	and many skill checks,
4698200	4700200	our gang decided the juice was safe
4700200	4703200	and drank the delicious juice.
4703200	4706200	They were so enamored by the juice
4706200	4709200	that they demanded to see the juicery where it was made.
4709200	4712200	Father Tinder took the gang to the juicery,
4712200	4715200	but outside was a drunken knight named Darmvon.
4715200	4717200	The drunk accused the Father Tinder
4717200	4721200	of putting the entire village in danger
4721200	4722200	and attacked.
4722200	4724200	But as Krista Berg moved to intervene,
4724200	4727200	the drunken knight fell on his own blade,
4727200	4728200	impaling himself.
4728200	4732200	But what did Darmvon mean with his strange words?
4732200	4736200	What secrets did the juicery hold?
4736200	4739200	Why is everyone so interested in juice?
4739200	4742200	What the fuck is going on to my left?
4742200	4747200	Find out on an all-new episode of Harmon Town Time.
4747200	4749200	...ice beats.
4751200	4753200	All right.
4754200	4755200	Sorry, man.
4755200	4756200	We were, like, distracted by the crazy ice.
4756200	4757200	No, no, it's cool.
4757200	4758200	I just can't see,
4758200	4759200	because, like, Dan's in the way,
4759200	4763200	but very clearly something insane is going on.
4763200	4765200	It's just the big hunk of ice, is what I'm hearing.
4765200	4766200	You're in a hunk of ice.
4766200	4767200	I don't know.
4767200	4769200	That's not interesting at all, really.
4769200	4771200	The truth is that this also is not interesting,
4771200	4774200	but there's no easy way to make people drinks up here.
4774200	4775200	Yeah, I know.
4775200	4776200	Usually it's not a problem,
4776200	4778200	because we don't usually have drinkers up here.
4778200	4780200	No, I'm certainly not complaining.
4780200	4782200	I just couldn't see at all.
4782200	4784200	You know, I can't see.
4784200	4785200	But we should have a pill
4785200	4786200	that makes your fingernails stop growing,
4786200	4788200	and we should have, like, a little dispenser up here
4788200	4789200	that you could just...
4789200	4791200	Like, in Big, that robot that's like,
4791200	4792200	you want drinks?
4792200	4793200	Here you go.
4793200	4794200	We could do that.
4794200	4795200	We could just get a bartender.
4795200	4797200	We could just have somebody back here attend a bar.
4797200	4798200	No, I mean, but it's insulting.
4798200	4799200	You got to have a robot,
4799200	4801200	because a robot doesn't care if we...
4801200	4803200	If we just, like, kick him around a bit,
4803200	4804200	we'll pay the guy.
4805200	4806200	Hey, you dumb robot.
4806200	4807200	Give me a drink.
4807200	4808200	We could...
4808200	4809200	Every night, we could, like,
4809200	4810200	put up, like, 50 bucks,
4810200	4811200	and we'll have somebody from the...
4811200	4812200	We'll not...
4812200	4814200	There'll be a number under someone's seat.
4814200	4815200	50 bucks?
4815200	4816200	Where would they stand?
4816200	4817200	Back over here in the...
4817200	4819200	Or maybe over here in the 10 bar.
4819200	4820200	Obit will do it for 50 bucks.
4820200	4821200	I'll do it for 50 bucks.
4821200	4822200	Fuck, yeah.
4822200	4823200	Well, actually, we'll do that.
4823200	4824200	I will.
4824200	4825200	I mean, I'm not joking.
4825200	4826200	I know you would,
4826200	4828200	but it would also be interesting, yeah,
4828200	4830200	to have, like, a random person from the audience
4830200	4831200	be sweet bartend.
4831200	4832200	I said 50.
4832200	4833200	Is that too high?
4833200	4834200	No, it's too low.
4834200	4836200	No, you low-balled it.
4836200	4837200	100.
4837200	4838200	What do they call this?
4838200	4839200	No, $140.
4839200	4840200	No, $140.
4840200	4841200	Okay, let's try next week.
4841200	4842200	$100 surprise bartender.
4842200	4843200	Jesus.
4843200	4844200	$100 surprise bar...
4844200	4845200	I like it.
4845200	4846200	We'll put the bucket over here,
4846200	4847200	and if we snap our fingers,
4847200	4850200	they're getting paid to come bring us drinks.
4850200	4853200	And we'll mic them up so that then we can go...
4853200	4855200	How's it going over there, Tony?
4855200	4856200	And then Tony can go,
4856200	4858200	my name's Alice.
4859200	4862200	We're talking a higher bit ratio
4862200	4864200	because you're going to get two more bits each show
4864200	4866200	from, like, the time you make the drinks,
4866200	4867200	you get more bits.
4867200	4868200	What are you talking about?
4868200	4871200	I think every week we find a different way
4871200	4873200	to select, like, you know,
4873200	4875200	like, it'll be some whose driver's license number ends
4875200	4876200	with a thing, or I don't know,
4876200	4879200	like, we'll find a way to, like, select somebody.
4879200	4882200	Well, I will change my driver's license.
4882200	4885200	Dan, just give Abed $100.
4885200	4886200	I'm just joking.
4886200	4887200	I'm having fun.
4887200	4889200	I keep thinking about the thought experiment
4889200	4893200	of taking Abed, Gaeth, and Steve Brody
4893200	4897200	up to an elevator on the top floor of a really tall building
4897200	4899200	and putting them both in it and pressing the lobby button
4899200	4901200	and then running down and just waiting
4901200	4903200	to see what's going on in that elevator.
4903200	4904200	Steve Brody?
4904200	4906200	Yeah, we've had him on the show.
4906200	4907200	Brody Stevens.
4907200	4908200	Brody Stevens.
4908200	4909200	No, I know Brody Stevens.
4909200	4910200	Yes!
4910200	4911200	I know him.
4911200	4912200	You got it.
4912200	4913200	I smoked...
4913200	4915200	Well...
4915200	4917200	I think if Brody Stevens and Abed touched fingers,
4917200	4918200	they would create a singularity.
4918200	4920200	You should do stand-up.
4920200	4921200	Steve Brody.
4921200	4922200	I used to do stand-up with Brody Stevens.
4922200	4923200	I know him.
4923200	4924200	He's like a mill stripper.
4924200	4925200	Yeah.
4925200	4926200	All right.
4926200	4927200	It's weird.
4927200	4928200	I have photographs of that.
4928200	4929200	Okay.
4929200	4930200	You do have photographs of that.
4930200	4931200	Spencer, we were all distracted.
4931200	4932200	I'm sorry.
4932200	4933200	Doing your eloquent soliloquy there.
4933200	4935200	Yeah, there was an ice situation, I think.
4935200	4938200	So what's going on exactly right now in the nutshell?
4938200	4941200	You guys, you were outside the juicery
4941200	4944200	after having ingested this lovely juice.
4944200	4945200	Right.
4945200	4947200	Darmvon the night, he had came up and he was like,
4947200	4950200	you guys, you fucking guys, you're going to kill us all.
4950200	4951200	We're all dead.
4951200	4956200	And then he attacked and he fell on his own blade.
4956200	4957200	Right.
4957200	4959200	And that just happened.
4959200	4961200	And then you guys were all like,
4961200	4963200	we're still excited about juice.
4963200	4966200	I want to make sure...
4966200	4969200	I get down by Darmvon's head, you know,
4969200	4971200	like they do in the movies when someone's dying.
4971200	4972200	Darmvon.
4972200	4976200	In case he's got some extra words to squeeze out.
4976200	4980200	He's like, you got to stop him.
4980200	4984200	We'll all die.
4984200	4985200	Is that Darmvon?
4985200	4986200	Yeah.
4986200	4988200	Is he talking about Father Tinder, you think?
4988200	4990200	Or Admiral Darkstar.
4990200	4994200	Oh, by the way, while that's happening, I loot him.
4994200	4996200	You're going to loot the man while he's dying?
4996200	4997200	I'm fucking...
4997200	4999200	I'm looting everybody that dies.
4999200	5001200	Father Tinder's like, hey man, that's fucked up.
5001200	5003200	There's like, you know...
5003200	5004200	Yeah, don't die.
5004200	5005200	What do you call them?
5005200	5006200	Estates and shit.
5006200	5007200	There's laws like...
5007200	5009200	Father Tinder's standing right there?
5009200	5011200	Yeah, he's all here.
5011200	5013200	I just put it on the ground and I go,
5013200	5014200	this guy's got lots of shit.
5014200	5015200	Oh, yeah.
5015200	5017200	But I mean, that's got to go to his family.
5017200	5020200	Okay, well, I take inventory of what he's got.
5020200	5024200	He's got five gold pieces, one belt buckle,
5024200	5027200	three torches, one sword,
5027200	5030200	a half-plate mail suit of armor.
5030200	5031200	That's all.
5031200	5033200	Dibs on the buckle.
5033200	5035200	My pants are falling down.
5035200	5037200	Yeah, exiting on the Ibs day.
5037200	5039200	I think we're going to play it cool here.
5039200	5041200	Father Tinder, why was this guy so irate
5041200	5043200	and accusing you of horrible things?
5043200	5046200	Well, we all just saw it.
5046200	5048200	Don't you remember?
5048200	5050200	That literally happened seconds ago.
5050200	5053200	I said why do you think he would be doing that?
5053200	5055200	Oh, I know why.
5055200	5058200	He was possessed by the demon of alcohol.
5058200	5061200	The second the alcohol reached his lips,
5061200	5064200	he was already dead.
5064200	5067200	Sounds like someone spiked his punch.
5067200	5074200	Could I, as a paladin named Dignity,
5074200	5078200	could I perhaps pull out my ability to smite evil
5078200	5079200	two times per day?
5079200	5081200	Tonight the role of Dignity Sars guard
5081200	5084200	will be played by President Barack Obama.
5084200	5091200	Yeah, what evil do you want to smite, though?
5091200	5096200	Well, I'm assuming the father's got some sort of darkness in him.
5096200	5099200	Must I select between the two or is it just general evil?
5099200	5102200	As it happens, you're a paladin and you can detect evil,
5102200	5104200	yet you detect no evil among him,
5104200	5107200	and you get the feeling if you tried to smite his evil,
5107200	5109200	it wouldn't smite him, evilly.
5109200	5113200	Guys, why don't we just take a tour of that juice factory?
5113200	5116200	It's awful to see a guy die.
5116200	5119200	Yeah, I would like some free samples.
5119200	5121200	Now, I mean, I don't want to be rude.
5121200	5125200	I enjoy juice a lot more than the next guy,
5125200	5127200	but it's getting late.
5127200	5129200	A man just died.
5129200	5132200	I have to go inform his wife and kids.
5132200	5136200	There's an angel demon beating down our magical barrier.
5136200	5138200	Maybe we should just turn in for the night.
5138200	5140200	You know what? I'm on for the juice tour.
5140200	5142200	You know what?
5142200	5144200	You know what we should do to cover more ground?
5144200	5147200	You tend to the city's more dire business,
5147200	5149200	given a civic emergency,
5149200	5156200	and we will volunteer to go report the bad news to Darvon's wife.
5156200	5160200	And then we'll, like, do a juice tour on the side?
5160200	5163200	Maybe just tour the juicery tomorrow.
5163200	5165200	I mean, I'll take you there. It'll be great.
5165200	5167200	No, it'll be different tomorrow.
5167200	5168200	Maybe I won't want to do it tomorrow.
5168200	5171200	Father Tender, are these soul rods holding up?
5171200	5173200	Is this force field going to last much longer?
5173200	5175200	Oh, yeah. It'll last forever,
5175200	5177200	as long as God's favor is on our side,
5177200	5181200	and no one drinks the demonic alcohol.
5181200	5183200	Is there a difference between the juice and the alcohol?
5183200	5186200	Juice is juice. Alcohol is evil.
5186200	5191200	Did he know he was drinking demonic alcohol?
5191200	5193200	All alcohol is demonic. He knew what he was doing.
5193200	5195200	Oh, so he's just a drunk.
5195200	5198200	Are we in the presence of any alcohol at this time?
5198200	5202200	Uh, no, no. Not the way I see it.
5202200	5204200	Just wholesome juice.
5204200	5205200	Wholesome juice.
5205200	5207200	All right. Well, we'll go tell his wife about his death,
5207200	5211200	and you go do city things.
5211200	5214200	I think I'd just go to bed, I guess, really.
5214200	5216200	Well, I mean, wait a second.
5216200	5217200	You returned some library books or something?
5217200	5218200	No, no.
5218200	5220200	Where are we going to sleep tonight, Father Tender?
5220200	5222200	Is there a hotel or a hostel for us?
5222200	5224200	You know, you could go...
5224200	5226200	Didn't she want to go tell the town...
5226200	5228200	Whatever. Let me answer your question.
5228200	5229200	There's extra bests.
5229200	5233200	We will take on thy duties.
5233200	5235200	I mean, we'll do it.
5235200	5240200	And then you can attain to your previous, like,
5240200	5241200	Stop.
5241200	5244200	I'm sorry. I was trying to help this out.
5244200	5248200	You might have to forgive my partner's loquaciousness.
5248200	5252200	If we could, perhaps, find the wife,
5252200	5254200	and you can accompany us.
5254200	5257200	What I'd like to do at this time, though...
5257200	5259200	I have a horse, if I can mount the steed,
5259200	5262200	and I'll ride the caboose on this train,
5262200	5265200	and I'll put you in front of me and keep my eyes on you.
5265200	5269200	Well, I mean, I can go tell the wife and kids,
5269200	5271200	and you don't have to come, or you guys can go do it,
5271200	5273200	and I don't have to come.
5273200	5275200	I don't know why we have to all do it together.
5275200	5277200	But you seem reluctant to let us do it.
5277200	5279200	We should test in the bedchamber.
5279200	5281200	I'm going to change courses here.
5281200	5283200	I'm going to backtrack. Let's go together.
5283200	5285200	Why don't you take a nice nap in the bedchamber?
5285200	5288200	I feel like we should go, and you should go to sleep.
5288200	5289200	Yeah, bedchamber.
5289200	5290200	You need your rest.
5290200	5292200	Or you could stay here and bury the body.
5292200	5293200	Well, yeah.
5293200	5296200	Speaking of which, he puts his fingers to his mouth,
5296200	5298200	and he whistles, and two guards show up
5298200	5300200	in red and white uniforms, and they're all like,
5300200	5302200	What's all this, then?
5302200	5304200	And he's like, This man, he attacked us.
5304200	5306200	He killed himself, basically.
5306200	5308200	And they're like, Oh, okay.
5308200	5311200	And they start hauling the body off.
5311200	5312200	That's it.
5312200	5314200	Well, that's the end of that, then.
5314200	5315200	Was that for nothing?
5315200	5317200	Well, now, let's continue talking.
5317200	5319200	You wanted beds, I think, right?
5319200	5321200	I'm tired. It's been a long day.
5321200	5323200	I can take a snooze.
5323200	5326200	As I said, there's extra beds in the Constabulary,
5326200	5328200	if you'd like to rest.
5328200	5330200	Is that another made-up word?
5330200	5333200	It's like a police station.
5333200	5336200	All right, we'll go to the Constabulary and rest.
5336200	5338200	Sounds like you get stabbed there.
5338200	5340200	Well, you might.
5342200	5346200	Yeah, I'm not feeling this Constabulary, fellows.
5346200	5347200	Can I say that?
5347200	5348200	That's just a joke.
5348200	5351200	It's a little, like, stab-licious.
5351200	5353200	Let's just go to the Constabulary and get some sleep.
5353200	5355200	Let's go sleep at the Constabulary.
5355200	5356200	I'll stay awake.
5356200	5358200	Yeah, but stab is in the word.
5358200	5361200	In the morning, we'll go over to Darmvan's wife's house,
5361200	5362200	which is what district again?
5362200	5365200	Well, if you don't want to do it tonight, that's not a big deal,
5365200	5367200	but I just feel like it should be done tonight.
5367200	5368200	I'll do it. It's fine.
5368200	5369200	No, I'll do it.
5369200	5370200	Well, you guys are...
5370200	5371200	Well, somebody do it.
5371200	5372200	Yeah, someone do it now.
5372200	5374200	I'll do it. I'll do it.
5374200	5375200	Okay, well, go, go.
5375200	5376200	Well, let me do it. Where does she live?
5376200	5380200	She lives over on Reading Street.
5380200	5381200	I'm going to Reading Street.
5381200	5382200	I go with him.
5382200	5383200	All right.
5383200	5384200	I'm going to hang back.
5384200	5385200	I'm going to stay here without it.
5385200	5387200	Yeah, I'll hang back.
5387200	5389200	I'm going to go home.
5389200	5390200	All right.
5391200	5394200	Why don't you guys go dig up what you can dig up at the Constabulary?
5394200	5395200	I'll tell you.
5395200	5397200	Oh, we'll find some stabbing.
5397200	5401200	Quark and I are going to go check out this guy's wife.
5403200	5405200	I feel like it's high school,
5405200	5409200	and I was told to go somewhere so that someone else could fuck.
5409200	5411200	It's not. That's not...
5411200	5413200	We're not going to fuck his wife.
5413200	5417200	I'm sorry, check out his wife also means look at her.
5417200	5420200	But I'm just saying, look, cover more ground.
5420200	5421200	It's an investigation.
5421200	5424200	I think that there's strange things afoot in this town.
5424200	5425200	It's all sealed off.
5425200	5427200	This guy's crazy about juice.
5427200	5430200	Guy was saying he's going to kill everybody,
5430200	5432200	and then he falls on his own sword.
5432200	5434200	I saw him roll the one, too.
5434200	5436200	That wasn't supposed to happen.
5437200	5440200	When that guy fell on his sword, he rolled a one.
5440200	5441200	All right.
5441200	5445200	So we go up Reading Street to the gals.
5445200	5446200	Yeah, you do that.
5446200	5449200	You do that as Father Tenner departs.
5449200	5450200	You get to Reading Street,
5450200	5453200	and you see a small house that must be it.
5453200	5457200	It's a cylindrical house with a small conical roof.
5457200	5458200	Yeah, yeah.
5458200	5460200	That looks like it.
5460200	5462200	A cylindrical house.
5463200	5465200	Conical roof.
5466200	5468200	They say it looks like a dick kind of.
5468200	5470200	And that's what they said, yeah.
5470200	5472200	It's a pre-address society.
5472200	5475200	All right, I knock on the door.
5475200	5477200	What time of day is it, by the way?
5477200	5478200	It's really late.
5478200	5480200	It's probably like 11 or 12.
5480200	5482200	Well, it's kind of early.
5482200	5483200	I don't know.
5483200	5484200	Sure.
5484200	5485200	I mean, at night, though.
5485200	5486200	Oh.
5486200	5487200	Okay.
5488200	5489200	Sorry.
5489200	5491200	Knock, knock, knock.
5492200	5493200	Hello.
5494200	5496200	Hello, Mrs. Darmfon?
5497200	5499200	She opens the door.
5499200	5501200	She's like, yes.
5501200	5503200	We have terrible news for you.
5504200	5505200	I'm sorry.
5505200	5510200	Your husband, in the commission of his duties to protect the city,
5510200	5513200	figuratively and literally fell on his own sword.
5525200	5527200	He's no longer with us.
5527200	5532200	I hand her his belt buckle that I took from the pile.
5533200	5535200	You took the belt buckle?
5535200	5538200	Just to verify our story.
5538200	5541200	Well, I also have the gold coins, too.
5543200	5546200	Her eyes well up with tears, and she's like,
5546200	5549200	oh, I knew this might happen.
5549200	5553200	He was talking about it, you know, in the past few days.
5553200	5556200	Mrs. Darmfon, before you continue,
5556200	5559200	could my partner and I come into your home
5559200	5562200	so that this conversation could happen in private?
5562200	5565200	I mean, I don't really know who you guys are.
5565200	5567200	Well, it seems to me, Mrs. Darmfon,
5567200	5569200	from the way things are going around here,
5569200	5573200	that us being strangers means you can trust us the most.
5575200	5576200	All right.
5576200	5578200	Come in.
5578200	5580200	I'll put the kettle on.
5582200	5584200	Just don't put any juice in it.
5584200	5587200	Now, Mrs. Darmfon, you're saying that he was talking about what
5587200	5589200	over the last couple of days?
5589200	5592200	He was talking about how Father Tinder had a magic power
5592200	5594200	that made him untouchable by anyone.
5594200	5597200	You couldn't even try to kill him if you wanted to.
5597200	5599200	Why would somebody want to kill Father Tinder?
5599200	5601200	Oh, because that power that he has,
5601200	5608200	it's highly sought after and not, you know, not, or not uncommonly.
5608200	5611200	In fact, I would say it's a common occurrence.
5611200	5615200	People, enemies, malefactors, and sometimes dangerous
5615200	5617200	and more dangerous creatures come to the city
5617200	5622200	to try and regain control of this power that he possesses.
5622200	5623200	I pull Sharpie aside.
5623200	5626200	Do you think he has one of those magical shards,
5626200	5628200	those power crystal thingy shards?
5628200	5631200	Did you ever hear anyone say anything about a shard of something
5631200	5633200	or other, or a power of something,
5633200	5636200	or a something of power, or a shard of something?
5636200	5638200	The only thing Darmfon ever talked about
5638200	5642200	was how the Scriptures mentioned something about holy stones.
5642200	5644200	Ooh.
5645200	5648200	Cut your oven into boards with a constabulary.
5648200	5650200	Hey, uh...
5650200	5656200	I think there's an echo in this constabulary.
5656200	5658200	Echo, echo, echo.
5658200	5661200	Uh, what...
5661200	5665200	Is there anyone there to show us to our accommodations?
5665200	5667200	Well, so you guys are outside,
5667200	5669200	you're walking towards the accommodations,
5669200	5673200	but then up rolls a gnome in a small wooden wheeled chair.
5673200	5677200	That's not shitty that you're small and you're a gnome.
5677200	5680200	You're also in a wheelchair.
5680200	5682200	Am I starting this bad?
5682200	5686200	Sir Chris, again, Mr. Gnome, if you'll forgive us,
5686200	5692200	my name is Dignity and my partner's name is not.
5692200	5694200	This is Sir Chris.
5694200	5697200	Yeah, no dignity with this woman.
5697200	5700200	Look, look, little gnome, I mean, honestly,
5700200	5702200	I didn't mean to say that because you're a gnome.
5702200	5704200	I mean, obviously, I was joking, right?
5704200	5706200	Sir Chris, if you would.
5706200	5707200	I'm just trying to, like...
5707200	5708200	I understand.
5708200	5710200	I want to divide some information if there is anything to get from this.
5710200	5712200	He probably likes comedy on each other.
5712200	5717200	Is there perhaps anything of note about the evening?
5717200	5719200	You know, just the way things have been going in the air.
5719200	5722200	Well, how long have you been in that little cart?
5727200	5728200	I should...
5728200	5732200	Camille's out of a job, by the way.
5732200	5734200	You're in, Camille's out of a job.
5734200	5735200	Was that mean?
5735200	5736200	No, it's great.
5736200	5737200	I mean, I'm saying the obvious.
5737200	5738200	It's all good.
5738200	5739200	It's all good.
5739200	5741200	The gnome speaks up, he's all like,
5741200	5745200	you must have forgotten, for I am Spizbulb,
5745200	5747200	the gnome you've saved.
5747200	5749200	Oh, Spizbulb.
5749200	5750200	Oh, the guy that got...
5750200	5751200	It's been years.
5751200	5752200	No, no, no.
5752200	5759200	I mean, I remember when he was, like, walking around on two little legs.
5759200	5760200	You know?
5760200	5763200	And, like, this whole cart thing, this is new.
5763200	5764200	You realize he can hear it.
5764200	5765200	Spizbulb.
5765200	5766200	Spizbulb.
5766200	5767200	Spizbulb.
5767200	5768200	I mean, come on.
5768200	5769200	We're buddies.
5769200	5770200	Oh, Spiz.
5770200	5774200	Remember that time I gave you a noogie and you thought it was funny?
5774200	5776200	Anyway, great to see you.
5776200	5779200	What sort of information, maybe, do you have for us?
5779200	5780200	I'm just feeling a lot better.
5780200	5782200	I'm able to roll around in a wheelchair now.
5782200	5784200	You know, all these healing sessions.
5784200	5785200	They're working.
5785200	5786200	It's great.
5786200	5787200	This place is fucked up, though.
5787200	5789200	You shouldn't trust anyone around here.
5789200	5790200	I don't...
5790200	5793200	You don't say with a name like Constabulary.
5793200	5794200	Speaking of the...
5794200	5795200	Obviously.
5795200	5797200	You shouldn't stay at the Constabulary tonight.
5797200	5798200	It's real...
5798200	5799200	It's gonna be real dangerous.
5799200	5800200	I mean, I got a tower.
5800200	5804200	You know, not that I don't trust him because he's a little guy with a cart,
5804200	5809200	but I feel like we should probably bail.
5809200	5811200	We should hang out with our homies over at the...
5811200	5812200	Where are they at?
5812200	5813200	With some girl?
5813200	5814200	You know?
5814200	5816200	She's like a prom queen or something?
5816200	5818200	Well, that sounds great.
5818200	5819200	Let's go do that, then.
5819200	5820200	Yeah, let's do that.
5820200	5821200	I mean, like...
5821200	5822200	Here's what we're gonna do.
5822200	5823200	How far are we gonna get with this guy?
5823200	5824200	All right.
5824200	5828200	Thank you, Spiz Bob.
5828200	5829200	Spiz Bob.
5829200	5830200	Yeah, yeah.
5830200	5835200	It's been great, sir, and your notes are duly noted by us.
5835200	5839200	What we're gonna do is take a different tack on this.
5839200	5843200	We won't reveal it to you, heeding your words of not trusting anybody,
5843200	5845200	but honestly, we're going somewhere else.
5845200	5846200	Wonderful Constabulary.
5846200	5847200	Thanks for the talk.
5847200	5849200	It's really nicely decorated, but I mean, come on.
5849200	5850200	I mean, once you've seen them all...
5850200	5853200	This is not my Constabulary.
5853200	5855200	I'm trying to steer you away from there.
5855200	5857200	I'm just saying you're kind of like the host kind of deal.
5857200	5859200	Why don't we just let it get a move on ahead?
5859200	5860200	Let's just, like, get out of here.
5860200	5861200	We move to...
5861200	5862200	It's been fresh.
5862200	5863200	It's been fresh.
5863200	5864200	Yeah.
5864200	5865200	We gotta...
5865200	5866200	No, let's move.
5866200	5867200	I'll give you a little advice.
5867200	5870200	If I can drag my friend away, just a moment.
5870200	5871200	Yeah, let's go.
5871200	5872200	Sir Charles.
5872200	5873200	Sir Charles.
5873200	5874200	So you don't have to drag me.
5874200	5875200	Sir Charles.
5875200	5876200	Honestly.
5876200	5877200	Maybe there's a little cloth over the cart, so I think he was walking.
5877200	5879200	You know, there are two types of rhetoric in this world.
5879200	5882200	In every movement, there's a rhetoric of convergence and a rhetoric of agitation.
5882200	5883200	What he said...
5883200	5885200	My partner here is using a rhetoric of agitation.
5885200	5886200	He's the guy with the words.
5886200	5887200	I just...
5887200	5888200	I hang out.
5888200	5889200	Let's go.
5889200	5890200	So if you could just...
5890200	5891200	So we're on our way.
5891200	5892200	We're on our way to the house.
5892200	5893200	We're gonna rejoin.
5893200	5897840	Well, you guys should come back to my tower to get sleep and not sleep in these beds when
5897840	5901440	you guys want to sleep, if that would require us to trust you, and you've just told us not
5901440	5902440	to do that.
5902440	5903440	Sounds like a double negative.
5903440	5907320	But, I mean, we have this whole backstory that has been established.
5907320	5908560	We know each other so well.
5908560	5910280	Why don't we head toward the tower?
5910280	5911520	You know what?
5911520	5912520	That's probably interesting.
5912520	5913520	Like, so interesting, dude.
5913520	5914520	So we have...
5914520	5915520	Hey, seriously?
5915520	5916520	We are like mine.
5916520	5917520	I mean, like, he's obviously on...
5917520	5918520	Sharpie and I...
5918520	5919520	Meanwhile, yeah.
5919520	5920520	Meanwhile, back at the house.
5920520	5921520	I'm not really well back at the house.
5921520	5922520	Can I take a rain check?
5922520	5923520	Back at the damn vorn or whatever the house.
5923520	5924520	Back at the damn vorn house.
5924520	5925520	Well, good night, madam.
5925520	5926520	Thank you.
5926520	5937520	Thank you for the information about Father Tender.
5937520	5944520	Well, between those leads and what I'm sure our partners have turned up, I'd call this
5944520	5946520	case just about close.
5946520	5947520	Yes.
5948520	5953520	You don't have to be flag confident which way the wind is blowing on this town.
5956520	5957520	All right.
5957520	5961520	As I'm leaving, I take out the gold coins that I purloined off of her dead husband.
5961520	5965520	I said, these belong to you and our condolences.
5965520	5967520	But thank you for your information.
5967520	5973520	And if it's any assurance, we will do our best to right whatever's wrong in this town.
5974520	5979520	I thought we'd retired from the adventure game, but it seems like as soon as you get
5979520	5981520	out, they pull you back in.
5981520	5986520	It seems like nothing gets you in an adventure quicker than avoiding one.
5986520	5988520	We haven't learned this from 6,000 years of stories.
5988520	5990520	We walk back into town and we bump in.
5990520	5991520	Wait, hold on.
5991520	5993520	One thing, just to close up with the lady.
5993520	5994520	Ma'am?
5994520	5995520	Yeah.
5996520	6002520	I understand this is a difficult time, but this is also part of a larger thing.
6003520	6004520	Zip.
6006520	6011520	You talked about the things that he mentioned about Father Tindred being crazy.
6011520	6018520	Were there any documents, maps, secret artifacts, things hidden under his floorboards, anything
6018520	6020520	cinematically stowed away?
6021520	6024520	Did you have a locket around his neck?
6025520	6027520	You're not there.
6028520	6034520	Also, where would you, any incarnation of you have learned that from anyone?
6034520	6036520	He seems like a locket guy.
6042520	6048520	You keep shouting out things to people who aren't in the room with us and about it.
6048520	6050520	I mean, I understand.
6050520	6051520	One of the things is this.
6051520	6052520	You know, you got to come clean with me.
6052520	6054520	If you're a shape shifter, that's one thing.
6054520	6055520	Oh, yeah.
6055520	6056520	No, I'm no shape shifter.
6056520	6061520	Well, you know, then you're crazy, and that requires a bit of care.
6061520	6062520	He's right.
6062520	6063520	My bad.
6063520	6065520	No, I'm afraid no evidence at all.
6065520	6066520	I'm afraid not.
6066520	6067520	Nothing incriminating.
6067520	6068520	Documents, no.
6068520	6073520	Well, God bless you, ma'am, and please stay strong and at the risk of sounding crass.
6073520	6079520	I think you've got, you know, a lot of years ahead of you, and you look great.
6080520	6086520	I don't think that, you know, I don't think that your life is over just because your alcoholic husband died.
6086520	6089520	Well, you never know when it's your time.
6089520	6090520	That's true.
6091520	6095520	I, myself, had a father who...
6096520	6097520	It's pretty late.
6097520	6098520	Okay.
6103520	6104520	All right.
6105520	6106520	Yeah.
6108520	6110520	I guess you're right.
6110520	6113520	I'm in the background shitting myself laughing.
6116520	6117520	Oh.
6117520	6118520	I guess.
6118520	6119520	Okay, all right.
6119520	6123520	I get up from laughing, and as you're walking away from the door, I would imagine...
6123520	6125520	And I give you an ironic high five.
6125520	6128520	I go, way to go, Clark Gable.
6129520	6131520	She's trying to comfort her.
6134520	6137520	You can tell me about your dad on the way back to our friends.
6137520	6143520	Well, he was buried up to his neck by cobalt or something, and then we left him like three years ago.
6144520	6145520	All right.
6145520	6147520	Oh, hey, look.
6147520	6156520	Walking towards some sort of place to sleep, a tower, we see Christopher and Dignity Sarsgaard.
6156520	6162520	Outside the Constabulary, talking aside about 15 feet away from a small gnome in a wheelchair.
6162520	6165520	Last time, I met a girl with the last name Stab.
6165520	6166520	I mean, crazy.
6166520	6167520	Spizball.
6167520	6168520	Spizball.
6168520	6169520	Hey.
6169520	6170520	Spizball, how you doing, man?
6170520	6171520	Hey.
6171520	6172520	Hey.
6172520	6173520	What's up?
6173520	6174520	I see you're getting around.
6174520	6175520	Yeah, I'm getting around.
6175520	6176520	I'm doing pretty great.
6176520	6178520	These guys are just talking away from me.
6178520	6180520	I could still hear them.
6181520	6182520	Super annoying.
6182520	6183520	Not talking about anything important, though.
6183520	6184520	Spizball, we're tired.
6184520	6187520	Do you have a place we can stay, and then we can walk and talk about what you might be
6187520	6189520	able to tell us about Father Tinder?
6189520	6191520	Yeah, that's exactly what can happen.
6193520	6200520	Hey, Spizball, you know, I know we have differences, but about this Father Tinder...
6200520	6201520	What differences did we have?
6201520	6202520	I didn't detect them.
6202520	6203520	No, I mean...
6203520	6204520	We're friends.
6204520	6210520	I know I talked about your little will cart, but I just want to know, is that Tinder situation?
6210520	6211520	I mean, what's that like?
6211520	6212520	It hurts.
6212520	6214520	I'm in a lot of pain.
6214520	6215520	What?
6215520	6223520	Let's not run the family house and shiver me tinders.
6223520	6224520	We should be.
6224520	6228520	If you guys are ready to get on your way, certainly we've convened a committee and done
6228520	6233520	some discussions and come up with a policy that says that we're ready as well.
6233520	6236520	So if we could just maybe proceed forward with this.
6236520	6243520	Yeah, I think the streets have ears we should wipe to interior Spizballs at home.
6243520	6245520	That was the silent game we're playing.
6245520	6250520	Wait, can we go down the line and say what we think this guy's name is?
6250520	6253520	Dan, you go for it.
6253520	6254520	Skizball?
6254520	6255520	Skizball?
6255520	6257520	What do you think his name is?
6257520	6260520	It's Skazz Bill.
6260520	6262520	I don't know.
6262520	6265520	I was told Spizbob, but again, my source is, you know.
6265520	6266520	Spizbob?
6266520	6267520	Is that what he said?
6267520	6268520	Spizbob.
6268520	6269520	Spizbob.
6269520	6272520	Yeah, Jeff got it.
6272520	6273520	Oh, man.
6273520	6278520	I was saying, let's circle the wagons here.
6278520	6280520	We don't get a lot of things right.
6280520	6282520	Let's call the guy the same name.
6282520	6284520	Yeah, I think we get a lot of shit to correct.
6284520	6287520	Try having Hussein thrown at you.
6287520	6289520	So I'm with you on this one, brother.
6289520	6293520	All right, so we've got a Spizbob's non-square home.
6293520	6295520	Yeah, it's like a tower.
6295520	6296520	It's like a tower.
6296520	6298520	What kind of name is Spizbob?
6298520	6299520	It's a family name.
6299520	6302520	It's kind of, I'm sorry, but you got to change that, dog.
6302520	6303520	Jesus, take it easy.
6303520	6304520	I don't agree.
6304520	6305520	I don't agree.
6305520	6306520	I'm just saying.
6306520	6308520	Christopher, you're really on a kind of...
6308520	6310520	I'm getting too old for this.
6310520	6311520	No, I don't know.
6311520	6314520	I mean, maybe that works for him, but...
6314520	6317520	The guy is physically disabled
6317520	6321520	and giving us a home free of murder.
6321520	6323520	I know, but if his name's Spazbob,
6323520	6326520	it's like he's clearly doing something wrong.
6326520	6328520	He doesn't want to be called Spazbob.
6328520	6331520	You're like the jock in a nerd movie.
6331520	6334520	I know, but I'm just like...
6334520	6337520	Oh, if it isn't Spazbob.
6337520	6340520	All right, so we get up to Spazbob's place.
6340520	6343520	It's a cramped and dirty location.
6343520	6346520	It's full of all sorts of weird gizmos and gadgets,
6346520	6349520	little pieces of metal and weird bottles.
6349520	6352520	There's all sorts of still set up all over the place
6352520	6356520	and liquids travel to and fro and weird tubes and vials and stuff.
6356520	6357520	It's all over.
6357520	6360520	He's like a crazy mad scientist kind of type,
6360520	6363520	and he's just kind of taking you through to a room with a bunch of beds,
6363520	6365520	and he has a big bottle of alcohol,
6365520	6367520	and he's like, do you guys drink alcohol?
6367520	6369520	I drink alcohol.
6369520	6371520	Hey, guys, first of all, no alcohol.
6371520	6372520	We got to chill.
6372520	6374520	No, let's drink it.
6374520	6376520	Because, I mean, he probably put something in it.
6376520	6378520	Spazbob, the guy that tried to kill us,
6378520	6380520	he was drinking alcohol.
6380520	6382520	Did you provide that alcohol to him?
6382520	6383520	Yeah, man, anyone who wants it.
6383520	6385520	That's like my job and stuff.
6385520	6387520	I used to do it back at Bill Martigan's.
6387520	6388520	I'd do it everywhere I'd go.
6388520	6391520	But he went crazy on it.
6391520	6394520	You know, alcohol, people get addicted.
6394520	6396520	They drink it. They make some poor choices.
6396520	6399520	Well, maybe he went sane in a crazy town.
6399520	6402520	Yeah, he didn't mean to fall over on his own.
6402520	6404520	Well, he rolled a one. I saw it.
6404520	6407520	I'm telling you, he rolled a one.
6407520	6412520	Can I maybe at this time just exercise my ability to detect evil,
6412520	6416520	just possibly to see if there is anything to stay alert about?
6416520	6421520	Spazbob is completely blameless.
6421520	6427520	Spazbob, what do you know about Father Tinder's attitude towards alcohol versus juice?
6427520	6429520	I mean, it's fucked up, right?
6429520	6430520	Everyone loves drinking.
6430520	6431520	I love drinking.
6431520	6435520	Nomes love drinking almost as much as we love riddles and cigarettes.
6435520	6436520	Oh!
6436520	6439520	I smell booze.
6439520	6442520	Spazbob, can I have a drink?
6442520	6444520	Yeah, man, everyone can. He starts pouring.
6444520	6446520	Wait a minute, wait a minute. It's like that level of mist.
6446520	6448520	I would advise against such action.
6448520	6451520	Hey, man, I'm a gnome too, man. I want to drink.
6451520	6454520	We have been, you got to resist those tendencies.
6454520	6455520	I may be crazy.
6455520	6457520	You didn't detect any evil on this stuff?
6457520	6458520	No, don't drink it, dude.
6458520	6459520	I mean, like, remember that game...
6459520	6461520	Detection is only 50% of the balance.
6461520	6462520	Don't drink it.
6462520	6464520	I'll drink it first to test it.
6464520	6466520	Okay, he's gonna drink it first.
6466520	6468520	He drinks a bunch of it.
6468520	6470520	It's all great. He's like, yeah!
6470520	6475520	I say, hey, don't bogart the chalice, Alice.
6475520	6480520	Hey, man, I wouldn't drink anything that touches homeboy's lips.
6480520	6481520	I think he's on to...
6481520	6484520	I also, I run very quickly to the trademark office and trademark,
6484520	6487520	don't bogart the chalice, Alice.
6487520	6489520	Yeah, I think you guys have got it all wrong.
6489520	6492520	I mean, it's like, alcohol's been around forever.
6492520	6496520	This city that's got a bubble around it made from soul rods and praying,
6496520	6498520	where the guy who inexplicably...
6498520	6499520	He's a religious fanatic.
6499520	6500520	...carts juice around.
6500520	6502520	The people who get drunk want to kill him.
6502520	6505520	I mean, like, I'm on their side.
6505520	6508520	A lot of people say a lot of things.
6508520	6513520	And when a community comes together,
6513520	6518520	it is not on the responsibility of every person to carry the weight of everything.
6518520	6522520	It is on the responsibility of one person who chooses to accept the mantle.
6522520	6525520	So I will choose to accept the mantle of not drinking alcohol.
6525520	6530520	But if you guys want to exercise your personal rights to do so, go ahead.
6530520	6531520	But understand.
6531520	6533520	Hey, you can close Guantanamo any day now.
6533520	6536520	It's been, like, eight years.
6536520	6537520	You know...
6537520	6540520	And maybe a couple less wars than when you got elected.
6540520	6544520	Now doesn't have to drink to have thine good old time.
6544520	6547520	Guys, go ahead. Sample, as you will.
6547520	6550520	I take a big pull off of Spizball's booze.
6550520	6551520	It's great.
6551520	6554520	It's some of the best booze you've ever imbibed.
6554520	6556520	Are we all imbibing?
6556520	6557520	Should I...
6557520	6558520	You can do whatever you want.
6558520	6559520	I, for one, am not.
6559520	6560520	Spizball...
6560520	6561520	There's your partner I bibed.
6561520	6562520	I'm going to be with you.
6562520	6563520	I absolutely imbibed.
6563520	6564520	I mean, we've come this far together.
6564520	6565520	I'm not going to imbibe.
6565520	6567520	Hey, Spizball, is there a restroom?
6567520	6568520	Is there a restroom runner?
6568520	6569520	I have to roll a one.
6569520	6570520	Yeah.
6570520	6572520	Is he rolling a...
6572520	6573520	It's right through that door.
6573520	6574520	He's rolling a...
6574520	6577520	I'm not going to roll a two.
6577520	6579520	I just have to roll a one.
6579520	6580520	Trademark that, please.
6580520	6581520	Trademark that, please.
6581520	6582520	I run back to the trademark office.
6582520	6583520	See, a Bali shag?
6583520	6586520	Is it Bali shag or is it Bobladdy?
6586520	6587520	Yes.
6587520	6588520	What?
6588520	6589520	Sounds like it's Bali shag.
6589520	6590520	Stay in the pocket.
6590520	6591520	Stay in the pocket, bro.
6591520	6592520	One is tobacco.
6592520	6593520	Okay.
6593520	6595520	If you're not...
6595520	6597520	When you're not saying something,
6597520	6598520	there's your brain going like,
6598520	6601520	I'm not saying something.
6601520	6603520	And then it will literally just fabricate.
6603520	6605520	You said earlier to like...
6605520	6608520	You'll just say fire hydrant log.
6609520	6610520	It's good. It's good.
6610520	6613520	I'll hang back.
6613520	6614520	I'll be like...
6614520	6615520	All right.
6615520	6617520	As I said, do not hang back.
6617520	6618520	Yeah, exactly.
6618520	6619520	Pedal to the metal, baby.
6619520	6620520	Pedal to the metal.
6620520	6622520	He said earlier not to hang back.
6622520	6625520	I just want to know more of your secrets.
6625520	6628520	I also want to know from Spizbulb,
6628520	6630520	what the town secrets...
6630520	6631520	They hate drinking.
6631520	6632520	I don't know.
6632520	6633520	I don't trust any of them.
6633520	6635520	Can't trust a dry county.
6635520	6636520	When did you move here?
6636520	6638520	I just moved here to leave Bill Martigan's.
6638520	6641520	I got exiled because my alcohol was too good.
6641520	6645520	Well, I don't trust this guy.
6645520	6648520	I think he's got a shard of power or something on him,
6648520	6649520	some source of power.
6649520	6650520	Have you heard anything about that?
6650520	6651520	Yeah, I mean, no, I haven't.
6651520	6653520	But I don't trust him either.
6653520	6655520	I mean, if I were you, I'd get the hell out of here.
6655520	6656520	I don't trust him.
6656520	6657520	Where does he live?
6657520	6658520	Can we go sneak attack him at night?
6658520	6659520	He lives in the...
6659520	6661520	You know, you were right by his house.
6661520	6664520	I remember when I made that guy drink my pee,
6664520	6666520	it's like, obviously he's trying to make us drink...
6666520	6667520	Guy was your brother.
6667520	6668520	Your cousin.
6668520	6669520	No, no, that was my cousin.
6669520	6670520	Okay.
6670520	6671520	No, but he's trying to make us drink his alcohol,
6671520	6673520	which might have his pee in it.
6673520	6674520	I'm just saying.
6674520	6675520	I just drank it.
6675520	6676520	And if it does, fine.
6676520	6677520	It's delicious.
6677520	6678520	I don't care if it's all pee.
6678520	6680520	He probably mixed it with some, like, 70%.
6680520	6681520	It's D&D.
6681520	6682520	There's, like,
6682520	6683520	Cheers that eat you.
6683520	6684520	Was it lemony in any way?
6684520	6686520	Was it lemony in any way?
6686520	6688520	No, it tastes like really good alcohol.
6688520	6689520	Listen, I think we've got a lot of
6689520	6691520	spindly little fellas here,
6691520	6694520	masters of the art of invisibility,
6694520	6696520	silence creeping around.
6696520	6697520	Who's that?
6697520	6698520	Who you got?
6698520	6699520	You. That's you.
6699520	6700520	Out of your back pocket.
6700520	6701520	My friend and you.
6701520	6702520	Oh, yeah.
6702520	6703520	Oh, I didn't know I could do that.
6703520	6704520	You're very sneaky.
6704520	6705520	You're a rogue and a thief.
6705520	6706520	You're very good and stealthy.
6706520	6707520	Really?
6707520	6708520	Yeah.
6708520	6709520	This strange cultish autocrat
6709520	6710520	sleeps tonight,
6710520	6712520	the sleep of the damned.
6712520	6715520	Listen, don't you think with my insane thief instinct
6715520	6717520	that maybe he might be, like,
6717520	6719520	trying to make us drink his pee?
6720520	6721520	What the fuck?
6722520	6725520	No, we're talking about Father Tinder, Chris.
6725520	6726520	Father Tinder.
6726520	6727520	I'm saying we should,
6727520	6729520	maybe you guys should sneak over to his house,
6729520	6731520	do a little ninja recon.
6731520	6732520	Oh.
6732520	6733520	See what you can dig up.
6733520	6734520	Maybe steal that.
6734520	6735520	I'll go with you.
6735520	6737520	I'll go in there and if you need some muscle.
6737520	6738520	He can't send them alone.
6738520	6739520	No.
6739520	6740520	He'll eat the house.
6740520	6741520	Yeah.
6741520	6743520	Can the two of them, the two of them,
6743520	6744520	hop on my horse.
6744520	6745520	What's that?
6745520	6746520	Yeah, I'll ride my horse
6746520	6747520	and I'll ride the two of them over there.
6747520	6749520	I don't know how stealthy that is.
6749520	6750520	Can I get my own horse?
6750520	6751520	No offense.
6752520	6754520	I mean, anytime you can conjure one.
6754520	6756520	Something about sitting behind somebody.
6756520	6757520	Sharpie, are you saying that
6757520	6759520	Christopher and I should maybe go sneak over
6759520	6760520	into Father Tinder's house?
6760520	6761520	That's what I'm suggesting.
6761520	6762520	And see if we can maybe break in
6762520	6764520	using his stealthy abilities
6764520	6767520	and my fighting ability to go in there
6767520	6769520	and maybe steal the shard off him?
6769520	6770520	Let's see what you can find in there.
6770520	6771520	Dig some stuff up, yeah.
6771520	6772520	Should we split up?
6772520	6773520	I guess we should all go as a team.
6773520	6776520	Well, I'm a clunky, clumsy wizard with, you know,
6776520	6778520	I could recharge my spells.
6778520	6780520	No, Sharpie, you're a great wizard.
6780520	6782520	I just mean, I'm not very stealthy.
6782520	6784520	Your name is Sharpie, I don't know.
6784520	6786520	You don't have to come in the building,
6786520	6787520	but you could be nearby.
6787520	6789520	You could be within a shouting distance.
6789520	6791520	I could be outside, like, in the equivalent
6791520	6792520	of a white van.
6792520	6793520	And you're...
6793520	6796520	Being a sort of microchip to your punisher.
6796520	6797520	Okay.
6797520	6798520	All right.
6798520	6800520	Spizball, do you know where Father Tinder...
6800520	6802520	Do you know where Father Tinder dwells?
6802520	6805520	Yeah, you guys were just right by his house.
6805520	6807520	It's attached to that juicery.
6807520	6809520	Is it well guarded, or does he live alone?
6809520	6810520	No, he lives alone.
6810520	6812520	He's a priest, right?
6812520	6813520	Hey, I got an idea.
6813520	6816520	Let's make him think that we're getting a juice tour,
6816520	6818520	but we're really, like, collecting notes.
6818520	6819520	It's the middle of the night.
6819520	6820520	He's not gonna think it's a juice.
6820520	6821520	About, like, how sketchy he is.
6821520	6822520	It's the middle of the night right now.
6822520	6823520	Oh, it is?
6823520	6824520	Yeah.
6824520	6825520	He doesn't give tours this late.
6825520	6826520	No, he's asleep.
6826520	6827520	Wait, wait, wait.
6827520	6829520	Well, okay.
6829520	6831520	I'm out of options, you guys.
6831520	6833520	You're never out of options.
6834520	6836520	Everyone's trying to distract him with...
6836520	6840520	You have a prime directive, and a prime directive is to run with our friend
6840520	6842520	and see what you guys can dig up.
6842520	6845520	We could just take a nap behind this, like, dumpster,
6845520	6849520	and then we'll get up and we'll get the early tour,
6849520	6851520	and we'll use that tour to, like...
6851520	6852520	We're in my house.
6852520	6856520	Christopher, Christopher, we're in the man's house.
6856520	6858520	You can't call this a dumpster.
6858520	6861520	You've insulted him enough already.
6861520	6862520	As I've said before.
6862520	6864520	As I've said before tonight.
6864520	6865520	His house is so shitty.
6865520	6867520	He can hear you.
6867520	6871520	His ears are in art and wheelchairs, too.
6871520	6874520	Let's, like, look around this house.
6874520	6876520	No, he's fine.
6876520	6878520	He's the guy that makes booze.
6878520	6882520	We're gonna go sneak attack Father Tender right now.
6882520	6883520	That's a different house.
6883520	6884520	Believe me, we're not...
6884520	6885520	No!
6885520	6886520	It's a different house.
6886520	6887520	I'll wait outside.
6887520	6888520	I'll be the getaway horse.
6888520	6890520	And while you guys are doing that, I'll use my ability to lay hands.
6890520	6891520	Getaway wagon.
6891520	6892520	Try to heal your ears.
6892520	6894520	Lay them on your ears and heal everything you've heard.
6894520	6895520	Oh, these ears.
6895520	6896520	They feel so good now.
6896520	6897520	Okay.
6897520	6901520	I could hear you just as well as I could this whole time.
6901520	6902520	Guys...
6902520	6904520	I'm sorry, you know...
6904520	6905520	I lead them outside.
6905520	6908520	I ask everybody, Father Tender and the whole crew, to go outside,
6908520	6909520	and I go down.
6909520	6912520	I take a knee and I draw a circle.
6912520	6915520	This is Father Tender's house.
6915520	6919520	And we draw up a little battle plan, like a little football play.
6919520	6921520	And I say, here's the deal.
6921520	6923520	Just spitballing here.
6923520	6924520	Me, Christa Burke.
6924520	6927520	We're gonna sneak in.
6927520	6928520	You sure you want me?
6928520	6929520	Yes.
6929520	6930520	Like little kittens.
6930520	6933520	You're gonna use your stealthy abilities to open the door,
6933520	6934520	use your tools, your thieves...
6934520	6935520	I do have those.
6935520	6936520	I have stealthy abilities.
6936520	6938520	You probably have thieves' kit and stuff like that.
6938520	6939520	Oh, yeah.
6939520	6940520	Look at that.
6940520	6941520	What's underneath the post-it.
6941520	6945520	And we're gonna break in.
6945520	6948520	Sarsgard, I want you nearby with a horse in case we have to make a hasty retreat.
6948520	6953520	Sharpie, you're gonna be in the van.
6953520	6958520	I'll hide in a pyramid of juice barrels.
6958520	6959520	Okay.
6959520	6961520	With several spells at the ready.
6961520	6962520	Okay.
6962520	6967520	The signal in case things go wrong is, oh, shit!
6967520	6968520	All right.
6968520	6972520	What if it's like something like, oh, silver dollar, silver dollar.
6972520	6973520	So he doesn't know what we're like.
6973520	6974520	Okay, again.
6974520	6975520	Good idea.
6975520	6976520	Good idea.
6976520	6977520	Silver dollar.
6977520	6978520	We say it twice.
6978520	6981520	If we say it once, it means get in here.
6981520	6982520	Everything's good.
6982520	6986520	If we say it twice, that means we're coming out hot.
6986520	6987520	Okay.
6987520	6993520	Should you make the signal for don't do something sound like an urgent version of do something?
6993520	6995520	Okay.
6995520	6996520	Come on in.
6996520	6998520	If you see me, lean out the window.
6998520	6999520	Silver dollar.
6999520	7001520	That means the coast is clear.
7001520	7002520	Okay.
7002520	7004520	Silver dollar, silver dollar!
7004520	7006520	That means it's bad.
7006520	7007520	That means it's bad.
7007520	7014520	Now, if I go silver dollar, that means somebody killed me while I was saying silver dollar,
7014520	7015520	silver dollar.
7015520	7017520	We need like a bad silver dollar.
7017520	7019520	I'm not going to go, silver dollar!
7019520	7021520	We're like, hey, guys, it's great.
7021520	7022520	Come on in.
7022520	7026520	Silver dollar, if I say it urgently, that means I was stabbed in the process of saying
7026520	7027520	silver dollar, silver dollar.
7027520	7030520	And if you say silver dollar twice, casually.
7031520	7032520	Wait.
7032520	7033520	So, wait.
7033520	7037520	You're saying if you say it once, excitedly, it's the same as saying it twice.
7037520	7044520	I'm saying if I say silver dollar any amount of times, casually, the coast is properly
7044520	7047520	clear, but I'm not going to because that's going to confuse it.
7047520	7049520	Oh, so the code isn't based on repetition.
7049520	7051520	The code is based on tone of voice.
7051520	7053520	Well, two silver dollars.
7053520	7056520	Two silver dollars means it's bad.
7056520	7057520	Things have gone.
7057520	7060520	Even if you're calmly, even if you're like, silver dollar, silver dollar.
7060520	7063520	Yes, because maybe I'm whispering, maybe there's a guy behind me going, silver dollar,
7063520	7064520	silver dollar.
7064520	7065520	Okay, all right.
7065520	7066520	Thank you.
7066520	7067520	Huh?
7067520	7068520	Adam, shut up.
7068520	7070520	We already have Abed up here.
7070520	7072520	Well, you know, he might be right.
7072520	7074520	No, we're not going to order pancakes.
7074520	7076520	It's the middle of the night.
7076520	7077520	All right.
7077520	7079520	So, okay, are you guys ready to do this?
7079520	7080520	Yeah.
7080520	7081520	Are we clear on the signals?
7081520	7082520	Absolutely.
7082520	7086520	Well, I mean, we know two silver dollars is bad.
7086520	7087520	Right.
7087520	7088520	Kind of.
7088520	7089520	Sometimes.
7089520	7090520	Okay.
7090520	7091520	We're running over time here.
7091520	7092520	So, we are.
7092520	7094520	So, Christopher and I, we sneak up.
7094520	7095520	Hold on.
7095520	7096520	Hold on.
7096520	7099760	Spizbull, before you guys leave, Spizbull was like, it's dangerous to go alone.
7099760	7100760	Take this.
7100760	7106400	And he gives you, he gives you a bundle of black sackcloth and he's like, don't use this
7106400	7109880	unless there's a serious, serious emergency.
7109880	7112080	And also it'd get destroyed by the barrier.
7112080	7113080	Just keep that in mind.
7113080	7114080	Bye.
7114080	7115880	We got a ball sackcloth.
7115880	7116880	Yep.
7116880	7117880	Exactly.
7117880	7118880	All right.
7118880	7119880	Remember that sackcloth.
7119880	7122640	Tell your sober self to remember that sackcloth.
7122640	7123640	Sackcloth.
7123640	7124640	We got a black cloth.
7124640	7127120	That would be bad if we touch the barrier with it.
7127120	7128120	Yep.
7128120	7129320	Can't leave the town with it.
7129320	7131720	Use it in case of emergency, but don't take it to the barrier.
7131720	7132800	Not when it's active.
7132800	7133800	Not when it's active.
7133800	7134800	So, we got to use this.
7134800	7136800	Don't take it to the ball sack bank.
7136800	7137800	Yes.
7137800	7138800	Okay.
7138800	7139800	Okay.
7139800	7141680	I guess to wrap this episode up, we all get together in a huddle and we put our hands
7141680	7142680	in like a football team.
7142680	7143680	Oh, yeah.
7143680	7144680	I like that.
7144680	7145680	That's great.
7146480	7150560	So, Sharpie, you want to say a couple of words before Christa Berg gives us the thing that
7150560	7152320	we say when we let our hands go?
7152320	7157980	Guys, I hope whoever's playing your characters next time is able to understand what's going
7157980	7158980	on.
7158980	7159980	Okay.
7159980	7162320	And let's stick together.
7162320	7163320	All right.
7163320	7164320	Jackie, join her cursive.
