0	29360	I know, I know. I'm not all dressed up like Jeff, but ladies and gentlemen, I am
29920	42560	alternate Jeff, just for tonight. And this week's Harman Town is now in session!
42560	55760	You begin! Spencer!
55760	80160	And now, ladies and gentlemen, the mayor of Harman Town himself, his honor, Dan Harman!
80160	92560	Hello, thank you very much. Thank you. It's very kind of you. It's not really kind, it's
92560	100080	it's Duregur. It's Duregur to apply when people come out. Yeah. What does that mean? I think those
100080	111040	are evil dwarves, right? Duregur? Yeah. By default, mandatory or rather perfunctory, part of the part
111040	115520	of the process. Hardly perfunctory. Just like evil dwarves. Having you out would not be perfunctory.
115520	121040	Yeah, well it kind of is though, isn't it? Huh? It's a show with me in it. I mean, it is perfunctory
121040	126720	to bring me out. It's perfunctory for them to applaud. Everything's fake. Everything that you
126720	135040	ever thought was real is gone. That's what you came here for tonight, right? I saw the line
135040	145600	outside. I got the divorce bump. This isn't my first time with the rodeo. I remember last time
145600	150800	you guys were hanging from the rafters, I'd just been fired. Now, come on, we're always sold out
150800	157760	and you guys are always very supportive and you always love me. And yes, there's the divorce
157760	162800	thing. I don't know if I mentioned this, Curtis. You didn't. I'd heard that. I did mention it to
162800	174160	everybody at a show yesterday. And so now it's out. I mean, it's good. I mean, as you can probably
174160	181520	tell, if you follow us on Twitter, it's amicable and mutual. It really is a simple
181520	189520	failure of two people to live the American dream of monogamy or commitment rather. We didn't fail
189520	200960	monogamy. I'm not like a shake from Dubai or something. We were living together and we were
200960	206720	best friends and we were eating pizza and watching movies. And then we were kind of like,
206720	212640	we could almost do this without being married or and all that kind of stuff. How many marriages
212640	219360	have you had? Well, it's interesting you say that because my first marriage ended in divorce
219920	227440	in much the same way. And we decided ultimately that rather than work on saving the marriage,
227440	235600	we would work on saving the friendship. And today that woman, my first wife, is in business
235600	243360	with my second wife and current wife. And she is also the godmother of my daughter.
244160	253520	So it can happen when it's done lovingly. That is either a beautiful story or the revelation
253520	262560	that Curtis is a strange David Koresh figure. And her cousin, her 13 year old cousin, is the
262560	271920	mother of my next child. And we all go to the same gun shows. It's like that Sherlock Holmes
271920	275840	troupe of ladies that you're hanging out with. Yeah. Oh, you've seen that. See, I know there's
275840	280880	crazy shit going on. No, you mentioned that. Yeah. And I never asked enough questions about that.
280880	285600	The Baker Street babes. Yeah. I don't even know what questions to ask. You don't need to.
285600	289280	It's better not to. Let's let it be a mystery. Let's let Curtis just have his mysterious life.
291280	295920	We have an exciting show. I have all kinds of shit going on. I mean, I don't want to spoil all of it
295920	301200	in advance. Let's just run down anything that I would talk about without bringing people out.
302560	307920	Let's see. I don't have anything in here except for notes about one of our guest's movies,
307920	312160	which was interesting. We'll talk to him about in a second. But yeah, there's the divorce thing.
315760	318880	I don't know if I, well, you brought up an interesting point when you said like saving
318880	325040	the friendship. I thought what was interesting was, you know, it was Aaron made the very smart,
325040	331200	like practical decision to, after we both like took a lot of space. And I wouldn't even call
331200	335680	what I did thinking about it. I was just taking time because the therapist recommended, she's
335680	340560	like, well, just don't make this decision hastily. Don't, don't do anything, you know,
340560	346400	just like you got nothing but time. Now you guys get married, you dumbasses. She talked us into it.
346400	351360	The, the, the, but, but it was like, yeah, so just take time. And I didn't even know. And I walked
351360	357200	into a couple's therapy session, you know, that we had scheduled and, and Aaron started it by
357200	363440	having, having made a decision. And it was, it was, it was very, very brave and thoughtful,
363440	368400	but then everything like spiraled into crazy, like shouting and yelling and accusing each other
368400	373120	of all of these crimes, you know? And I think the reason that happens is because it's fucking
373120	380080	embarrassing and hurtful to admit that, that love didn't work somehow. And I think you feel weird
380080	386480	about it. You feel bad. You feel like you spilled something. And then you, and then the easy way to,
386480	391440	to make it less like that is to get mad at this other person. Like, Oh, we must be breaking up
391440	396160	because they're an exceptional piece of shit. And so just yelling and yelling. And for 20 minutes,
396160	402160	while the therapist sat there and like, okay, you guys could do this or the other 364 days of the
402160	407600	year. Like, do you want to, and then it was kind of this calm sort of settle in. And the final
407600	411760	epiphany for both of us was, well, wait a minute. If we really are breaking up, if that's really
411760	417040	what we're doing, then we can immediately just start being nice to each other because we're both
417040	421760	good people that are really nice to strangers all the time. And we've only really been mean to each
421760	430000	other. And so we, uh, how long did that, did that take the, the process to get to that point?
430000	436640	Three years. No, say, uh, you mean to cool down? I don't know. 20 minutes, 30 minutes of like,
436640	441120	just kind of like tattling, you know? Well, you did this, you did that and you're like this and
441120	444960	you're like that. And this is why this is happening. It's your fault. No, it's your fault.
444960	449120	Like if you had, like, what's the implication there? If you hadn't done something, we'd be,
449760	455680	you know, because that's not a good, that's not a good idea to like be married to somebody that's
455680	460800	based on like, Oh, if you had done this thing, it's like, if you had done this butterfly effect thing,
460800	468640	it's like much better to think as you walk away from somebody that it's not because of some Mr.
468640	474720	Destiny bad movie flower you could have brought or, or thing you couldn't have said, uh, didn't say
474720	480160	it much better to just think that actually, shit, we dodged a bullet before we involved children.
480160	484080	Exactly. Um, so now I'm really judgmental of everyone that has kids.
486320	490320	And, and, and I'm kind of, yeah, it's weird. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting. And
490320	493760	by the way, I'm very, very, very, very proud of her. I'll probably start crying if I talk about
493760	502000	that, but, um, but I mean, I, like, especially I feel like, like, you know, if the relationship
502000	509600	was toxic, it was definitely toxic because of me and that toxicity came with a dynamic that was
509600	515360	uneven and the, and the uneven dynamic came with a comfort level. It was probably difficult for her
515360	521440	to, you know, it was very, very, very brave and admirable for her to actually be the one to put
521440	528080	the dog down, you know, instead of waiting. And, and, and, and like, that's, I think, I think I feel
528080	534960	like the moral of the story is like, or the irony of it is that we got married and we, we were
534960	538720	imperfect people that got married maybe for imperfect reasons. And because it wasn't working
538720	542160	for that reason, then we went to couples therapy and said like, well, how do we make this work?
542160	546480	And she said, well, first of all, you're both nuts. And like, I'll start seeing both of you
546480	552800	separately, which of course that's one way to triple your money as a therapist, but I do also
552800	558000	think that, that, that she was right. And because, because she started seeing Erin separately and
558000	562080	seeing me separately and seeing us both as a couple. And we were learning about how couples are
562080	566880	supposed to work and how this stuff works. And I think that, I think maybe the unspoken thing
566880	571440	the whole time, you know, was that we were both learning, well, given that this is how this works
571440	579520	and given that, given that I'm capable of being a normal person alone, like maybe we didn't, we
579520	583760	didn't really look at it until it was like right in front of our face. And then it all happened
583760	589360	very quickly. But I think that's the nice thing about it is that you don't, you don't enter a,
590160	595600	you don't enter a relationship for flawed reasons and then leave it because you're more flawed.
595600	600560	You leave it because you got better. You leave it because you improved, you grew
600880	608800	and learned stuff. And she's a, she's, she's, she's great. And I'm, I'm friends with 99% of, of,
608800	615360	of all of my exes, but I'll certainly continue to be like really good friends with her.
615360	622560	Cause she's one of the funniest people I've ever met. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
622720	636720	and blibbity blob. Give me my podcast award now. It's weird. It's weird. It was weird. The round
636720	640240	of applause is weird. I did not, you didn't do anything wrong. I'm saying it sounds weird.
640240	643120	It's all weird. If I was watching from an alien planet, I'd be like, that's weird.
644000	647600	It's weird what you're doing. Why did you play that recording of you crying when your cat died?
648320	652800	It was a guy that tweeted at me that he couldn't believe. He was like, where'd you do that? And I'm
652800	656880	like, what the fuck? What are you doing? I'm so mad at that guy still. So I'm like, what did you
656880	660400	think I was trying to do? Impress people. I played a, I played a recording of me crying.
660400	665680	Like it sounds horrible and fake and dumb. And I was like, it just seemed kind of weird
665680	669200	that you did that. I was wondering why you did it. I did it because you're mama.
672240	676800	Is, is fifth dead? No, she's fine. Oh, fifth is great by the way. That's why you really came.
678320	685840	She said she died. All right. What else? I know that I know there is a, uh, I don't think, I think,
685840	689760	I think I'm going to keep this up my sleeve because it seems like a good, uh, a good thing
689760	695600	to have up your sleeve, but I, an authentic MC like challenged me to a rap battle on Twitter.
697040	701360	Really? Are you here? MC clarity? Okay. Oh, damn.
701360	708160	Yeah. And I'm not being racist when I say he's an authentic MC.
710560	718320	Yes, he's black. I looked at his Instagram, not at his face. I looked and he's got,
718320	723040	there's flyers. Like you're, you're, is it safe to call you a professional MC?
726720	731120	Have you ever gotten like some of the door? Yeah, professional. No, no, no. Like,
731120	735440	I mean, I mean taken like, like, like, do they ever do like open MC nights? Like, like,
743040	747840	have you ever received a dollar for MCing in any indirect way? Okay. He's trying to dodge the issue.
749680	751520	Tonight I'm going to take down a professional,
752000	763840	a legit, a legit MC. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah. And with, and with him, I'm going to take down,
763840	765520	uh, racial stereotypes.
771920	777360	You're welcome. You're welcome. White people. You're welcome. Black people. You're welcome.
777360	781840	Hip hop. You're welcome. Harmon town. You're welcome. You're welcome.
783040	788080	I can't, we appreciate it. You're welcome. All right. Well, let's, let's move on that.
788080	792880	Cause we got a cavalcade of, of, of, of odd wonders tonight. Like it's very sturdy. Oh,
792880	796960	by the way, Curtis Armstrong, our guest comptroller. So good to have you back.
798960	806320	And honor as usual. Okay. So there was this thing it was called, it was, it was called records.
806320	810640	Like before most of you, uh, kind of started listening to stuff, there was like,
811920	815840	there were these chunks of vinyl and I don't even know how they made them, but, uh,
815840	820960	cause they were kind of going out when I was like, uh, younger. Um, and, uh, there was this, uh,
820960	828080	there's this guy that made this documentary about the rise and fall of the biggest, uh, uh,
828080	833520	vinyl retailer turn that ended up becoming also the biggest CD retailer tower records as a fixture
833520	838480	of Los Angeles started in Sacramento, quickly moved to San Francisco. It's just exploded.
838480	842720	It was, it was, it's so ubiquitous. Like until I watched this documentary that he made,
842720	846880	I wasn't even realizing that it was a story that you could follow that had a rise and a fall,
846880	852000	but indeed it did because they just went out of business and, and marking the end of an, of an
852000	858560	era. Um, this guy is very talented, a documentary director. He, uh, he's also an actor every once in
858560	863760	a while. Um, why don't we, uh, talk to him about, about one or both. Please welcome Colin Hanks.
878080	885600	Hello again. How many, how many, how many divorces are you on? I'm on four.
885600	892240	We're including all the different family members, but so, because it affects everybody. Oh, okay.
893120	899680	So there's my parents' divorce and then my wife's parents' divorce and then a couple of uncles,
899680	906240	maybe cousin. Did you ever get the, it's not your fault divorce talk? Always. That's part of the
906240	910560	contract of having a divorce. I think it's, you're, it's legally binding. Yeah. You have to tell the
910560	915120	kids it's not your fault, which is the child's earliest encounter with the concept of protesting
915120	920640	too much. Yes. So are you going to have like the conversation with the cat or dog? We already told
920640	930160	Spencer it's his fault. Yeah. But I get full custody of both of us. Um, the, but I, I remember
930160	934880	very distinctly riding with my dad in our station wagon and, and, and like it, and it was, it was
934880	939840	really delayed. And I say this with, with, with a lot of love for my dad. Like, like, um, I think
939840	944240	he's long since stopped like listening. Cause I'm always like, I'm always like casting shit, you know,
944240	950640	backward at my parents. Um, the, but, um, but I just remember like, cause I, I remember like,
950640	954800	I was, I was like looking at a comic book and I remember my dad trying to like awkwardly launch
954800	958560	into the, it's not your fault talk because my, my parents were getting separated. They ended up
958560	965040	staying together. Um, but it was just also alarm everybody. Most awkward thing in the world. What,
965040	971440	what an interview Dan. Um, good job. Well, I would say this, uh, the, the, it's not your fault talk
971440	978880	always sort of segue it like no matter how it goes, it's so uncomfortable for the parents that
978880	989280	it always segues into two Christmas conversation. And I remember being super, uh, uh, like jealous
989280	996080	because when I was a kid, I was in like my neighborhood, I was the only divorced, uh,
996080	1000640	I was the only child of divorce. All my other friends, their parents were married until they
1000640	1008400	all went off to college and then all the parents divorced, which is super fucked up. But I remember
1008400	1013200	being super jealous at all their, all their, uh, all my friends, uh, parents were still married.
1013200	1018160	And I remember even going so like deep into it, that's like, man, all right, yeah, two Christmases,
1018160	1025360	whatever. But if I was Jewish, I would have gotten 16 Hanukkah's that would have been fucking bad ass.
1026080	1032560	Wow. Yeah. That's about the extent of my math humor. Yeah. But I just keep going because every,
1032560	1037280	every Jewish kid I've ever talked to, like they, the first thing they lead with is like, don't,
1037280	1042560	that's not eight Christmases. It's like, it's like eight shitty half stockings.
1043680	1049440	It's like a, it's like a go bot if you're lucky. It's like, it's like eight, it's eight presents
1049440	1055840	from the aunt that clearly does not know you is what it is. Yeah. It's like, like vampire teeth.
1056400	1064960	Great. I guess, I guess our people are chosen. I don't know if this is the day we're supposed
1064960	1070800	to prove that, but I feel great. I'm, I'm, I'm off to school where the last three months have
1070800	1079280	been dedicated to our Lord and savior in the form of just fucking lavish, like blinking lights
1079280	1087360	is like Christ was born. Everyone here's $20. Here's a candy cane for breakfast. I'm doing
1087360	1092160	80s standup. I'm doing John Stewart's act for when he was sickly. All of the stereotypes are
1092160	1098000	being broken tonight. All of them. Um, all right. So you made this documentary. It's called, it's
1098000	1105360	called, uh, now it's, I want to say this too shall pass because it's the Buddhist thing,
1105360	1109600	but it's not that it's all things must, all things must pass. Um, and there's significance
1109600	1114720	to that that I won't spoil. Although I will say this documentary, this will sound like a lack of
1114720	1119520	endorsement, but really it's the remarkable thing about this documentary. There are no twists in
1119520	1125040	this story. No, you know how all the stores close, uh, literally all the, all the things that, I mean,
1125040	1130000	they can guess why. And then, uh, that, that, that, okay, this is a place that, that, that started
1130000	1135360	right when, you know, I mean, they, they, they, they started selling records and then 1963 happens,
1135360	1139920	the beach boys become a thing. The Beatles become a thing. The, the single culture goes to an album
1139920	1147200	culture and this place explodes. Yeah. Um, the, but, but yeah, I know that wasn't a question. And
1147200	1152240	they also can guess that then guess, guess what, guess why it all ends, but it's, that doesn't make
1152240	1158640	it at all uninteresting to like trace every step of this. Well, no, and that is actually sort of
1158640	1165040	the first, that was the thing that interested me to, uh, to start making it is I found out
1165040	1171280	that this guy, Russ Solomon, who founded tower records, he started selling used 78s from his
1171280	1180480	father's drug store in 1939 41. It's the, he's a little bit hazy with those dates, but, um, that's
1180480	1186560	how he started selling records. And then by the time that tower records closed its doors, he had
1186640	1193200	192 stores around the world. And so that little like factoid got me super supremely interested
1193200	1202320	in just the overall arc of the company. And I got lost in the most mundane minutia of tower records
1202320	1208080	and all of the little fascinating things from a historical perspective that I, that I find to be
1208080	1212800	really interesting. The fact that, you know, he opens up the first tower, the true tower records
1212800	1219440	in 1960. He spends eight years kind of perfecting it, opening three stores in Sacramento. And then
1219440	1226640	on, uh, basically he goes into San Francisco to go sleep with some woman who works at his barber shop.
1227520	1231920	Oh yeah. That story is so interesting. The story is incredible. It's incredible. And he
1231920	1235120	totally glides over in the documentary, the fact that he's married with a kid.
1235520	1242720	Oh, he doesn't mention that like at all, even though we have footage of him with his son
1242720	1248240	talking about how his wife was the bookkeeper at the pharmacy. But anyways,
1248240	1253360	I thought that was such a charming story. It is a charming story though. It is a charming story.
1253360	1258960	He goes to San Francisco, has this great night with this lady and then wakes up super hung over
1258960	1264640	and finds this location in San Francisco and decides he wants to open up a tower records.
1264640	1271520	He opens up in March of 68 right before San Francisco is invaded by hundreds of thousands
1271520	1276960	of dirty hippies from all over the world. And that ends up being the summer love and it becomes
1276960	1282960	the most popular store in all of San Francisco. Right. And so I found all of these little things
1282960	1288560	like that supremely fascinating. And I think a lot of people who kind of know some of the history of
1288560	1293520	that will can like go into it thinking, Oh, it's just going to be a documentary of dates
1293520	1299120	and places in historical context and all that stuff. And Oh, we miss vinyl, dah, dah, dah, dah,
1299120	1306320	but really what the story is, is about Russ and these, this group of, you know, people that worked
1306320	1313360	at tower that ended up working at this place for 30 plus years and really became like a family as
1313360	1320160	cheesy as that may sound. They became a family and work together and had a fucking blast going
1320160	1327600	around the world working in the music business. And they get married, they get divorced, they have
1327600	1333840	children, they have so much fun. And then at the end of it, they all have to fire each other. Yeah.
1333840	1339200	Yeah. That's crazy. It reminded me of like a documentary about, about our, about Ireland.
1340080	1344160	It was like, like that whole horrible, like the Michael Collins era of like, because it turns
1344160	1348000	into, it ends up becoming, they had to do more than fire each other. But yeah, but I mean,
1348080	1352320	it ends up becoming this other journey that I don't think many people think of. And we were
1352320	1359120	talking about this earlier, you know, I think for, for a large group of people relatively our age,
1359120	1364720	I'm looking, yeah, I think we're all cool. I think for people relatively our age, you know,
1364720	1369680	if they were even just a sort of like casual music fan, they would just think of tower as the place
1369680	1374080	that was everywhere and sold overpriced CDs. Right. Yeah. And you mentioned that backstage and
1374800	1378800	that, that, that, because there, that is part of the story is that all of a sudden best buy target.
1379360	1384640	Everybody starts being able to sell CDs for $10 a CD, which is how much it costs to, you know,
1384640	1388160	buy them and put them out on the shelf. And they're just like, we don't give a shit. This is the,
1388160	1393040	those little, if you buy your Britney Spears here, you'll buy more milk. The, and then the tower
1393040	1397040	records across the street is like, we sell our, we have to sell these for $20 or we're going to
1397040	1402720	go out of business. Yeah. And what's hard to even for me to wrap my head around, and I'm sure that
1402720	1409200	therefore for, for these little, little, little profligate fucks. I was going to say whippersnappers,
1409200	1414800	but that works too. Is that, is that, is that before the internet, which I can barely remember
1414800	1420720	now. And, but it was, it was like, imagine you mentioned the hate Ashbury movement. So imagine
1420720	1426240	like there's no internet. The newspaper is filled with lies. There, there is no, you know,
1426240	1430240	short of smoke signals or like, you know, just hanging out in a drum circle or something like
1430240	1435600	there's, there's not really a kind of, there's not really a hot bed of like kind of counter
1435600	1441280	cultural or, or even just straight cultural, like, like, like check-in points and to have
1441280	1444800	these giant, these giant record stores keep going up. And that's why they ended up being
1444800	1448640	192 of them is because everywhere that they were, they were never in, they were never in
1448640	1452400	our Wisconsin. They were never, they never, they made it to, they, they had like two,
1452400	1457680	35 of them in Japan before they had one in New York, but they never, and some, it almost
1457680	1462960	has to do, it almost seems to have to do with that kind of cosmopolitan need at that time,
1462960	1469280	because the same technology that ended up killing records in general would also supplant the need
1469280	1474720	for, I don't know, the equivalent of barn raising among, among people who want to care about
1474720	1478160	something other than what Nixon is telling them or something. Yeah, no, totally. I mean, like,
1478800	1484880	what was really, I found to be, I resent that sound. I just, you know, guys, Nixon was a bad
1484880	1489920	dude. I think we've established that when you come in, we've got serious issues.
1491120	1496880	No, like the, the thing that I want to, I mean, there are a lot of things that I, I, I, I love
1496880	1504640	about the, the, the overall story with tower, but the thing that I found to be most insightful and
1504640	1511920	also really inspiring was the fact that, you know, sure, it, it ended when there were 192 stores and
1511920	1517440	there are a lot of reasons why tower ended. It's not just the, you know, Aaron Sorkin,
1517440	1522240	simple answer of like, Oh, Napster killed it. Do you know what I mean? It's not that at all.
1522240	1527760	And we spend a large portion of the film actually really discussing what it was that actually killed
1527760	1531440	tower, which I found fascinating, not to interrupt you, but that is, yeah, I mean, well, because
1531440	1535840	that's the thing that I find really interesting because I always just assumed like everyone else,
1535840	1540000	like, Oh, the internet came and it just changed everything and no one could control it at all.
1540000	1545440	However, as we all know, Apple, which made computers and phones, um, decided to become
1545440	1550320	the music industry. They made that decision and tower at the time had a website and it's revealed
1550320	1555360	at one point at that exact moment, their website was on AOL and it was like this little like
1555360	1559920	rinky dink website. And it was just like, they could only be so progressive for so long. You know,
1559920	1565440	you can go, you can go from LPs to CDs, but you can't then also be have, you can't keep juggling
1565440	1570880	those chainsaws. No. And there's so much new technology that ends up sort of coming up and
1570880	1577920	tower was one of these places where they really prided themselves on trying. It was not a company
1577920	1583840	that was run from the top down. It wasn't some, it wasn't Russ Solomon saying, here is how you do
1583840	1590800	this stuff. Go make me rich. It was, here's the keys to the store. Stock what you want. Stock what
1590880	1597040	you think people are going to like, uh, when the cops, yeah, decorate it however you want. Just
1597040	1604320	don't show up drunk or high. And if you do, then go home. Um, and don't fuck me over. And that was
1604320	1610080	how the company ran. And it worked for 30 years. And it was, yeah, it's like a sort of model of the,
1610080	1616000	the, the, the souls in that movie who more than one of them does that awesome documentary thing,
1616000	1619920	which is what I go to documentaries for where they, they, they're talking about something that
1619920	1625680	seems innocuous and then their throat catches because they've been, they, they, they, those
1625680	1631920	souls are, uh, they, they, they're couching it as a cautionary tale. Oh, we put ourselves out of
1631920	1637280	business by not seeing MP3 coming or something like that. The, but the, the real story is that
1637280	1644560	it was a, it was an actual successful demonstration of really non-corporate. Yeah. Anarchic. Yeah.
1644560	1653040	Uh, uh, uh, small business turned to take into a global, uh, uh, level with, uh, God knows how many
1653040	1656800	employees and including their newsletter and all this stuff. It was like, they never, they had one
1656800	1661120	accountant practically the entire time. Yeah. And they didn't need to, there is no, there's no
1661120	1665920	necessary need to all of a sudden like take your stock public and start being beholden to a bunch
1665920	1671360	of things and, and mutual funds and good buddy booby do. It was like, it was like, it was just
1671440	1676000	a bunch of people that couldn't get jobs anywhere else. And they liked selling records and, uh, and
1676000	1680080	they kept growing and growing and growing that way. And they just kept, they, they just kept going
1680080	1685920	and they would go to, they would just constantly always be in that right place at the right time.
1685920	1692560	And as much as they would have the big stores in the, you know, like Los Angeles, San Francisco,
1692560	1697920	eventually New York, and then you get into the Chicago's, the New Orleans and stuff like that,
1697920	1705040	they would also have small stores in Stockton and sort of those off the beat sort of, you know,
1705040	1710400	off the beaten path type places where not a lot was going on culturally or, you know, the, the
1710400	1715920	places where, you know, the bigger bands would not stop to play. Do you know what I mean? And so they
1715920	1723760	had, uh, they really had a mentality, which was we want to be that place wherever we are,
1723760	1727120	where it doesn't matter what you look like. It doesn't matter what you're into.
1727920	1733200	You can come in, you can hang out, and it doesn't even matter if you have money. We will not bother
1733200	1740000	you unless you want to be bothered, unless you piss us off and you can hang out for as long as
1740000	1745520	you want. And if you don't leave with, you know, a record, that's fine. You know, maybe you'll come
1745520	1749520	back and then the next time you'll buy something. And then maybe when you buy something, maybe you'll
1749520	1753280	be open to hearing what some of our suggestions and then you'll leave with, you know, 14 different
1753280	1758160	records. Yeah. One thing I thought was interesting about that, by the way, was that I never knew,
1758160	1767520	was the, um, the album culture plus the CD culture became, you can't be experimental about your music
1767520	1773840	consuming anymore. Yeah. When you could just pay $3 for a piece of, uh, you know, black plastic
1773840	1777360	that was like, it was like, you could, you, you were more incentivized to kind of leave there with
1777360	1782320	a big box full of stuff and a good 10% of it, as when you go to the library, it might have been like
1782320	1786880	shit you might never listen to, but then you do listen to it and you're like, now I'm into
1786880	1791600	Aretha Franklin or something. And then that turns into holy shit. I only have so much allowance
1791600	1796480	and Britney Spears doesn't have any singles out on CD. Well, and that ended up being the most
1796480	1803200	fascinating nugget. When I asked Russ, I said, if you had to like blame everything on something else,
1803200	1809120	besides what, what you did, I said, what would be, you know, what would it be? Would it be Napster?
1809120	1814880	Would it be, you know, poor management? Like what would it be? And he actually said the biggest,
1816720	1820480	in his opinion, the biggest mistake was they stopped selling singles.
1820480	1823920	Now, if you think about this, and I don't want to get too boring here, but
1823920	1829360	you know, do you, anyone here remember buying cassette singles? Yes. Okay. Right. That's how
1829360	1835440	you started your addiction to buying music, whether you know it or not. That's how it started.
1835440	1839920	Just that small little hit first. And then next thing you know, you're going into that store and
1839920	1845680	you're buying maybe more singles or maybe you're buying the full albums that that, you know,
1845680	1851360	eventually at some point it's the focus sets, full CDs, whatever. Once they stopped selling
1851360	1857680	singles, they lost an entire generation of kids. And I know this because I'm that age. I was that
1857680	1861440	age. I remember when they stopped. But you weren't choosing between going to tower records and
1861440	1867920	downloading an MP3. No, but here's the thing. I remember when they stopped selling singles,
1867920	1874880	but at that point I was like, I love music so much. I'll buy CDs. I'll still do it. I just
1874880	1878080	couldn't buy as many, but I'll still do it. You had to be very careful about your choices. So
1878080	1883600	you're going to flatten out, but you're going to lose an entire generation of kids, even going
1883600	1890400	into a store. And once you do that, you lose an entire generation of future customers. And that
1890400	1896400	generation of kids all were in college when Napster was released. Yeah. They had no loyalty
1896400	1899920	to anything. They had no loyalty anyways. And also, and I think they're being too hard on
1899920	1902720	themselves. Honestly, I don't think if they had sold singles, I don't think they could have
1902720	1909440	competed with Napster, but it's easier to compete of, you know, a small single that costs, I don't
1909440	1915440	know, maybe a buck, two bucks. That's easier to compete with than completely free. Logically,
1915440	1921120	technically it's there. But I also think that obviously without the actual, like I can not
1921680	1928400	put on pants, they would have had to have a Netflix visionary idea in addition to already
1928400	1932640	having a visionary idea of being tower records. I feel like it's a beautiful bell curve, this
1932640	1937040	beautiful trajectory of like, you know, all things have to come to an end. I mean, like, you don't
1937040	1941120	want this thing to become Disney or any other thing. It's like, it's this beautiful bell curve
1941120	1946560	that lasts an entire generation and traces the evolution of music. And it is a bummer. And in
1946560	1954160	the end, the sad, it's like, well, this is how it ends. It never ends really great. It's not like
1954160	1959920	something like green, like euthanasia chamber. It's like the jaws of capitalism and the loans
1959920	1964080	being defaulted and the people being brought in and having to fire each other and all that stuff.
1964080	1970880	But let's, let's, let's, let's bring things to a positive note because, oh, but there is one more
1970880	1976480	reason to watch this movie. Well, if, if, if you get a chance to see it, it's out on Friday, we should,
1976480	1980320	I should mention, because I'm realizing we're talking about a movie that we've seen.
1980320	1985680	None of you have seen this. Oh, yeah. You can't see it on Friday. No, this is, this is the art
1985680	1991440	like in LA and the village. There's a guy, there's a guy in the movie. You have to watch it alone for
1991440	1998240	the most amazing mustache I've ever seen. Yes. Mark, Mark Vidage. Mark Vidage. Yeah. So in normal
1998240	2002160	time, because they're all like old and talking about the memories of it, he's got a regular Sam
2002160	2006560	Elliott. There's nothing regular about a Sam Elliott mustache, but he's like, okay, it's big.
2006560	2011920	It's a brush, whatever the, but then they, you see him in photographs and it's like,
2011920	2017120	I've never seen a mustache like this. It looks to me, if you just told somebody, yeah, somebody,
2017200	2025760	somebody took, somebody took a duct tape with strip of hair and put it right over his mouth,
2025760	2030080	like a hostage. Yeah. That's what his mustache looks like. It just looks like, it just doesn't
2030080	2034480	look, it looks like something happened. Like something flew across a room and splattered.
2034480	2039520	I'm so glad that you've picked up on Vidage's mustache because we've taken this movie out to
2039520	2045120	a bunch of different film festivals and we always get, you know, you get super nervous. It's funny.
2045120	2051840	I could seen, I've sat through horrible, shitty things that I've acted in and been totally fine.
2051840	2056000	Like no problem. I don't care how like it plays. It's just sort of like, ah, whatever. But when
2056000	2062480	it's your movie that you've like fucking like put everything into all of a sudden, every noise that
2062480	2069600	you hear while the movie is screening is of the utmost importance. And we have these like little
2069600	2074960	moments in the film where I can tell if an audience is with us or if they're just not.
2074960	2081280	And luckily that mustache is the fucking, like that's the dividing line. It really looks like,
2081280	2086640	you know what it looks exactly like to me, his mustache in the photographs, um, being from the
2086640	2092000	Midwest, you make like the Euro restaurants, there are, uh, uh, I, I missed them because it's like,
2092000	2098800	it had the rotisserie and you like, you just carve off the big greasy strips of jagged lamb meat,
2098800	2106080	just giant long ruler length strips of, of, of, of, of serrated edge lamb meat and just lay them
2106080	2110560	in a pita. And like, if I don't, if I don't ask for anything else, just do that. And I'm just,
2110560	2116240	I'm angry at myself. Um, just that it looks like a piece of Euro meat. Like, like, like, like was on
2116240	2120400	a ceiling fan after a party and he came in and was like, Hey guys, I have a good idea about a
2120400	2125840	record industry. And I just went like, I just like went over his lips though, like centered on his
2125840	2129840	lips. That's the weird thing about his mustache is it looks like he's like a weird part of a weird
2129840	2136400	freedom of speech, like a demonstration. But what's, but you got to understand that we specifically
2136400	2142640	cut it this way because we have this old photo of him and you see this old photo and it's basically
2142640	2147840	you just hear his voice saying like, Oh, well I, you know, I, basically describing the first time
2147840	2152240	he walked into tower records and got a job and we see have this old black and white photo and
2152240	2159120	everyone starts chuckling at the mustache, like every way. Like I've heard people go like, Oh, wow.
2160400	2165440	It's an audible thing. Like not just a gas, but like words as well. Like, Oh Jesus,
2166480	2172960	not as detailed as lamb off of a fucking hero placed on a Pito with hummus and the whole thing,
2172960	2180880	but close to it. And then the next shot is him today. And he still has the fucking mustache
2180880	2185600	and then people lose their shit. They go, he still has it. Oh my God. Well,
2185600	2190080	he kind of refined it though. Cause back then it was like, Oh, someone ran over a centipede in like
2192160	2196560	and I don't know why it ended up on your mouth. Like why on your, on the center of your lips,
2196560	2201840	like he clearly, like he clearly since those days had children or wives that said like,
2201840	2209840	you got to clear out an area. It's a way I recognize people is two dots and a slit.
2211680	2217840	Steven Spielberg, uh, definition. Like, that's like, they just hit the gray alien triangulation
2217840	2224240	two dots of a slit or it's not a person. And you got you two dots and a fucking like just Euro.
2224240	2228880	Yeah. Anyways. All right. So, um, you'll see, you'll see, uh, I'd like, you know,
2228880	2234160	when you go, please promise me when you see that photo, go, Oh, when you see the black and white
2234160	2240560	photo. And then when you see it, I live, if you, someone could just go, Oh shit. Yeah. Just for my
2240560	2245120	own person. I would love it if someone did that. Truly worth the price of admission. Honestly,
2245120	2250640	just see the mustache. You'll love it. Um, the, uh, I'm going to bring out, I, I, I'd like you to
2250640	2254880	stay up here. Cause we haven't talked about Fargo. I know you also, you have this diversion.
2254880	2266880	Now that we've fed your PR furnace, I haven't seen Fargo, but I'm glad love to hear about it.
2266880	2272560	Uh, like, but, uh, before we do, I, I, I'd like you to meet my, uh, my neighbors.
2274880	2280320	I'm going to sit over here, right? No, no. Yeah. Okay. We're going to do the tonight show rules.
2280320	2284320	Yeah. Tonight show style. Yeah. That's great. Thank you, Colin. That's very classy of you.
2284880	2293040	All right. There you go. By the way, no relation.
2295280	2297520	No, no. Okay. Um,
2300240	2306080	did I get a bigger laugh? Sometimes your voice, it's like, wow. No, I know.
2307280	2312000	He's talking about Michael Keaton, right? Yeah. All right. Cool. Um, the, um,
2312240	2322480	now I, now I feel bad. I was like, you said it. Um, uh, my next two guests, you've,
2322480	2328000	if you're a hardcore Harman, Armenian, um, you, you know, is that what they're called now?
2328000	2332960	Armenians? Yeah. Well, we did cause it's LA based. So we want to respect the Armenian culture here.
2332960	2339360	Yeah, of course. Um, the, uh, the, the, the, you know, you've, you've met, uh, uh,
2339360	2345040	my neighbors before I, I called, uh, uh, Beth, my, uh, the tumor lady. I had a conversation with
2345040	2349920	her and found out she had survived a golf ball sized tumor and that she was fine now. And I was,
2349920	2355520	I'm endlessly fascinated with this shit because I'm morbidly like, like terrified. And, um, uh,
2355520	2359440	and she and her husband came up and her husband didn't say a word, uh, even though he's got
2359440	2363200	interesting things about him. But, but tonight is not the night for them to have interesting things.
2363200	2372640	Tonight is a night for me to plumb the depths of their, to me, completely, um, uh, baffling
2372640	2381200	obsession with, uh, with, with four trees in their backyard. So we're just gonna, we're just gonna
2381200	2389520	talk about it. We're neighbors. They, they have been texting me, Beth has been texting me, uh,
2390480	2396400	uh, for a long time about her trees and, and, and she's gonna come out and we're gonna talk
2396400	2402560	about her fucking trees. Please welcome Beth Bootson and Dan Bootson.
2402560	2421120	All right. So one day, one day Dan, we will have on the show just to talk about the really
2421120	2427120	interesting thing, uh, of, of like, like the, you know, there's no LA heritage. There's no such
2427120	2433120	thing except Dan's dad was this guy named Gypsy Boots, who you can, you can look up on Wikipedia.
2433120	2439360	It was like the, he was like the founding father of the health craze, uh, like the idea of health
2439360	2446240	food, the idea of like yoga and all this stuff, like, like being, being hip, being like, uh, uh,
2446240	2452320	married to the, uh, people that we think are cool. There was this guy Gypsy Boots running around and
2452320	2457040	that's Dan's dad who's now lives next door to me, which I think is like that, you know, those stories
2457040	2460800	don't happen in New York. You don't live next to the guy that, um, you know, you probably live next
2460800	2467920	to a fisherman or a plumber. It's New York. They do stuff there. Here in LA, you, you, you, you might,
2467920	2473520	you live next to like, who knows? It's like, like, like, oh, my dad was a famous hippie. All right. I
2473520	2478320	didn't sell that very well. Um, it's a great story. Guys, they fish and plumb in New York. They don't
2478320	2486000	do that here. All right. So Beth, all right. So it's been, uh, it's been a long time. We've been
2486000	2492560	exchanging texts about your trees. All right. So where, where do you want to start? I, I, because
2492560	2497360	I, among the things I was saying, I was suggesting that we just read our texts. Yes. So, um, let's
2497360	2501200	just start from the beginning. Do you, do you want to, do you want to just start by doing the dialogue
2501200	2506720	of the texts? Um, maybe so. Okay. That's good. Yeah. It's like that love letters play. Well, because,
2506720	2511840	yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like love letters. The, the, um, the, I guess there's a little bit of preamble
2511840	2519760	where we just say like, well, well, let me just tell you this. Um, our house, um, outside in the
2519760	2529520	back, we have, um, little courtyard and we have, um, the most beautiful, or we had the most beautiful,
2531120	2539040	seven, it looks like seven story, um, 100 year old eucalyptus trees. And these things, uh, provided
2539040	2546880	a wall of privacy from our neighbor, from our neighbor. And, and they had a beautiful canopy
2547520	2555520	where we hung, um, Moroccan lanterns from, and we would have, um, great, uh, barbecues out there,
2555520	2561440	which you came to our house for. Yes. Um, a wine. Yeah. Um, did you have lamb? And then I came on my
2561440	2567040	show and said, I met this tumor lady, no lamb, but I sort of got, this is, this is more about me.
2567040	2574960	This is about me. Not about, not about you. Like I never, I never noticed or cared about the trees.
2574960	2580960	I don't, I didn't know they existed. Apparently they're gone. So, so, so that's the, that's my
2580960	2586080	context of like this, like, well, first of all, I mean, so, so, so for, if it starts with like,
2586080	2590240	you're calling, you're calling me like, and I was a little like, I was at Beth boots and I'm like,
2590240	2596320	oh, it's the, you know, it's my neighbor. And I'm not picking up the phone, the voicemails and saying
2596400	2600240	like, Dan, and you were, you were, you were inexplicably kind of cryptic about it. You're
2600240	2605040	like, Dan, I have to talk to you about something important to tell you. I don't know why you'd
2605040	2609440	bury that lead, but you're going to tell, and then you're sending me texts and saying like,
2609440	2612960	did you get my voicemail? I got to talk to you about something. And I keep, I'm in the middle of,
2612960	2618720	you know, as it turns out a divorce, but it's like, I got a, I got a studio I'm trying to keep above
2618720	2623520	water. And I, I'm like, like, ah, it's neighbors. Okay. But I always, I'm thinking the back of my
2623520	2627520	head. I'm like, oh shit. Like there must be something like, like maybe my sewage is coming
2627520	2632800	up into their sink or something. Could it be? So, so I'm walking and then I see Dan, he's walking
2632800	2637760	his dogs and your dogs. Yeah. So I was walking and I had to, of course, introduce myself again.
2637760	2646720	Every time we meet, I face blindness. Fine. I have to earphones to, I was going to my chiropractor
2646720	2652240	and I was listening to my podcast. I said, I said, Dan, you know, my, my wife's been trying to
2652240	2655680	reach you and he said, yes, I know. Oh my God. Oh God. What happened? What happened? Did the tumor
2655680	2660240	come back? What happened? And I said, uh, right. Is it a tumor? I said, no, exit it, but it's really,
2660240	2666080	it's, it's going to be, it's very upsetting. I said, it's the eucalyptus trees are, are rotten
2666800	2670960	and they're going to have to be removed. And the first thing Dan said was, are they on my property?
2674560	2679920	Yeah. And I've been a little quicker. I of course would have said, why? Yes. You could have tricked
2679920	2686000	me into paying for the whole operation. $25,000. Yeah. I was like, well, so, so then, but then I said,
2686000	2689360	well, no, no, they're ours, but they're, it's really sad and they're going to have to take them all out
2689360	2695680	and he dances. Well, they're just trees. But that's, that's, I want, I don't want you to gloss over
2695680	2702880	what I consider the moral of this story. They're just trees to me, to me, that's, to me, I want,
2702880	2708720	I just want that to always be in the background. There's beautiful trees, beautiful. They're just,
2708720	2714960	they're just trees. And I keep being, so, so, so just, just, just all those voicemails. And then
2714960	2718480	the conversation with Dan and I'm like, Oh fuck Jesus Christ. It was actually a little file in
2718480	2721920	the back of my head. Not that I did anything about it, but I was like, Oh God, there's a crisis.
2721920	2727680	I'm being, I'm being a bad neighbor. And I'm like, fucking trees. What? Okay. I was actually
2727680	2730720	charmed because it seemed like your concerns that you were going to wake me up with like chain
2730720	2735600	saws and things. So I'm like, Oh God, tell her not to know. No, I don't care. I don't, I sent this,
2736560	2745120	this letter out to all the neighbors on that next door app because I didn't want anybody being
2745120	2752720	furious with me when all these old one, oh, oh, oh, oh, you gotta, oh, you gotta eat the,
2752720	2758480	I didn't want people being furious with me for cutting these hundred year old trees down four
2758480	2763840	of them and be, they were the, um, like if you drive down the block, you just, you could see them
2763840	2768560	for from far, far away. I want to say, I want to say Dan, but I don't recognize his face. So I'm
2768560	2773440	like, I don't see the trees. Everyone else is upset. All right. Okay. Well, you know,
2774400	2779200	their medals are all in the mail. You accept into the role. I said, this is, this is what it is.
2779200	2782400	I know it's about me. I'm like, I just don't, I feel like I'm living in the twilight zone because
2782480	2789520	I'm like, I don't understand what's happening. So, so, so, so September 21st, 4 42 PM. Now,
2789520	2794080	do you want to, it occurs to me, do you want to read your part or should I read your part?
2794080	2798160	Whatever you want to do. Don't you read your part. Yeah. You read my part. Yeah. I'll read
2798160	2807200	your part and you read my part. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, it is with,
2813120	2818320	and I, and you just said like, you sent this to everybody, but I don't know. I think I'm just
2818320	2822960	getting this as a tech. Oh, by the way. Oh God. There's another, there's another important point
2822960	2827440	that I don't know to bring up now or later that Aaron McGathey is on all of these. It's just,
2827440	2831360	this is a message to me and my wife who were struggling to keep our marriage together.
2833840	2839520	And Beth, Aaron is Aaron is radio included in it. I thought they were still married.
2839520	2842400	No, no. Well, yes, you can. There's only one line at the end.
2842400	2845920	Aaron, Aaron, Aaron nails it at the end. Can I read that part?
2849440	2850640	I know I'll hand it over,
2850640	2854000	but I do want you guys to be prepared for the fact that when I say at the end,
2854000	2860880	I mean like at the end of roots, the mini series, like the whole point is that this is to me. And
2860880	2865600	here's the thing is I knew Aaron would be, I knew Aaron would be interested in this.
2866160	2869920	You were so wrong. I knew you might not, but I knew Aaron would.
2869920	2873600	Okay. Well, absolutely. All right. I wish she could. I wish she was here right now.
2873600	2877520	I thought you guys were still married. Oh, she's still here right now. I will channel her
2878560	2882800	on this one line at the very end. Very good. We're going to need you.
2882800	2889680	So here we go. Here's the, I mean, it is with much sadness that I write this,
2890480	2898480	but our four 100 year old eucalyptus trees will have to be removed. This is after so many voice
2898480	2903600	messages and conversations about it. It's like, this is news to nobody and never was.
2906320	2909200	It's been confirmed by a well-respected arborist.
2912320	2919440	That although the trees look healthy and are, believe me, but I end up being
2919440	2924320	the bad guy. So it's okay to laugh because she's beautiful. She's caring about trees. Like I end up
2924320	2929120	being the villain or I wouldn't be taking it. It's been confirmed by a well-respected arborist
2929120	2932880	that although the trees look healthy and are thriving on the outside, that they are full of
2932880	2937520	decay in the trunk and roots and are not expected to withstand a winter of rain and winds.
2938640	2944640	The tree trimmers will begin their tree cutting at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. New paragraph. Trees are
2944640	2952560	located at the end of the cul-de-sac and address withheld for stalker purposes, but
2952560	2958640	everybody knows where I live. Your neighbors, the bootsons. And then Dan Harmon wrote back and he
2958640	2965680	goes, sad to hear about these majestic trees, but I do feel you and your family will enjoy a fresh,
2965760	2968560	unobstructed view of my trademark nude sub meeting.
2974880	2980320	Something to talk about to all the other neighbors. If I can get a picture, think of all the money I
2980320	2986320	can make. Make sure you are in a good area and expose all so I can make a lot of money.
2987360	2992000	And then the weird thing is you left an emoticon. The emoticon is a yellow face going.
2992000	3003200	But it's like, wait, that should be my emoticon. So, okay, so then it's a day later, I think,
3003200	3009120	September 24th, maybe three days later, a photo of our strong, healthy-looking trees that our
3009120	3014880	arborist said would never survive El Nino. And there's this thing, it's like she keeps sending
3014880	3020640	this pictures. It's the same picture. It's like a... Dan is going to show, we actually brought...
3021440	3027360	Yeah, well, right. It was completely soft inside.
3030240	3037200	Okay, so I am in the minority. And on the outside, it was so green and thriving. I mean, just,
3037200	3045600	it was so lush. Who's life did we save? It's a hollow tree. That would come down on your house.
3046080	3052560	Oh. Well, and my house. But she keeps sending. It smells delicious. Yeah, it's true. You can let
3052560	3058960	this has always been my favorite flavored tree. Can you see the scroll of the pictures? Because
3058960	3067040	she just keeps sending the same picture. I wasn't trying to make a point. I did that because I was
3067040	3071440	in a place where the message wouldn't go through. So I was like, what's up? So I kept sending it.
3072240	3076800	And then after that picture, like nine times, and there's a picture of a human hand in, I guess,
3076800	3081280	what is a tree trunk. And then there's like a close up of just looked like Afghanistan. I don't
3081280	3086240	know what that is. And then there's just pictures of trees, normal healthy looking trees, which I
3086240	3090720	don't know. It's like, wait, are we past that part of the story? There's like all total, there's
3090720	3097120	7,000 pictures. And they keep coming in over and over again. So then after all of that,
3097120	3103120	so then you say, those photos did not go in the right order. Plus, it wouldn't send the photo of
3103120	3109680	the stump with the lovely hole in it. Yes, it did 900 times. So I kept trying to send it.
3110400	3116720	That's why you have 100 of the same photo. So you knew. That's also what happens when your
3116720	3123520	battery is at 2%. I don't know. You should see the view we have from our window now. It makes
3123520	3148480	me want to cry. Oh, here's a line from Aaron. Oh, I know you're doing that because you want it to
3148480	3157360	be over. But I actually was mistaken. Aaron's big line comes later. Yeah, no, yeah, it's like,
3157360	3164640	it's becoming Othello. It's like, this is a big part. So then, so then Beth in response to Aaron's
3164640	3172000	awe says, is that the best you can do? I thought I was talking to you. Oh, oh, oh, that's right.
3172000	3177600	In her phone, she can't tell when Aaron's talking to when I'm talking. Also, she's kidding. But
3178240	3190720	how about an apology? And then and then Aaron says, Oh, sorry. Then Beth sends an emoticon of
3191520	3198800	a yellow person drying their eyes with a handkerchief, then sends the same fucking circle.
3198800	3213600	Is your battery at 4% now? So then and then it says, Hey, good news. We can wave to each other
3213600	3218640	whenever we each whenever we see each other now, which will be every five minutes. We'll look up to
3218640	3226240	your window and you look down at ours. Exciting the rainbow and completely like becoming conscious of
3226240	3230400	the fact that I haven't responded to you in a while. I now I having learned to make animated
3230400	3237280	gifts. I now send I send my standard gift of me lowering my glasses to my nose and I just put the
3237280	3245120	meme caption. That's what I call an unhealthy eucalyptus tree. Because I don't know what to do
3245120	3254320	anymore. I don't know what to do. And then Beth says more drawn curtains now. And then lol. And
3254320	3263680	then later says still laughing out loud. Then then you're sending then you send a photo. There's a
3263680	3267920	there's something written on a board. More photos. There's another photo. There's a photo of the guys
3267920	3272720	who are cutting down the tree. Another of the same photo of the arm and the stump. Then there's a new
3272720	3277680	photo. There's a new photo of a tree stump. And this one has a pencil jammed into it. I'm starting
3277680	3286160	to show how soft the core is. You have to post all of this. You have to post all of this.
3286160	3291760	Then again same photo as far as I'm concerned. So then so then so then you said I want you to notice
3291760	3297920	the photo with the pencil in it. That's all soft center that can be pushed in with just a finger.
3298720	3303600	All of the trees although hard on the top have been rotten in the lower trunk.
3303600	3310080	Does that other eucalyptus tree belong to you? He's got one on his property. He's got one on his property.
3310080	3316320	I'm sure it's fine but some of the neighbors are starting to inquire about the other eucalyptus trees.
3316320	3324560	I can give you the number to our arborist. She might very well give your tree an A plus.
3324560	3332000	But I don't think that's what you're thinking. We had mushrooms growing on the bottom of one of our
3332000	3337120	trees. We also had holes in our tree that she could put a stick into to see how deeply that
3337120	3344960	stick would go in. That indicated decay inside. If nothing else it might give you peace of mind.
3346160	3348800	It'll give all the neighbors peace of mind too.
3352480	3356320	And then Dad Harvin wrote back I don't want to high road you
3356320	3360000	but my peace of mind is a lot fucking harder to come by than that boots in.
3362000	3372880	By the way going through a divorce like this whole time like so angry and drunk the whole time.
3372880	3376160	We'd never sober when I'm texting you.
3377200	3385280	And Beth goes okay. What can I do to help? I have a feeling that you will never have peace of mind.
3385280	3393040	I think you're doing fine. I guess part of what gives me struggle is the quest for independence
3393040	3400160	in a world defined by loneliness. In a lot of ways I guess I'm like a giant eucalyptus tree rotting
3400160	3405600	from the inside. They love it. They love it.
3405600	3416880	Aww. You identify.
3419040	3422320	Is that why you wanted to hold on to your eucalyptus tree?
3425280	3431200	Well I don't. Besides that tree didn't get hit with a belt by its parents.
3431200	3435680	And it never was and it never was able to do anything other than what it's doing.
3437040	3440240	Yes but it did get hit with some huge storms in its past.
3444800	3452240	As humans as humans we are told unlike trees that we are in charge of what becomes of us.
3452240	3457760	Their storms are our fault. That tree got to sit there for a hundred years while people got on
3457840	3462000	and off the bus in LA expecting things and having things expected of them.
3463680	3467200	In a weird way Beth that tree can totally suck my human dick.
3481360	3484400	I'm so glad I don't have my neighbor's cell phone number.
3487760	3498480	Besides I got hit with a belt by my dad but I remember all the great stuff he did for me too.
3498480	3500640	He did his best and he could be quite loving.
3506320	3510640	I think it got more than it deserved and I hope it burns in fucking tree health.
3517760	3525280	Are you okay?
3532480	3533120	Are you?
3536240	3537120	I'm doing well.
3539840	3543120	That's what you say but what if I push a pencil through you?
3543120	3546720	How soft will you turn out to be?
3547280	3552000	Oh that's the part they didn't apply. I was like oh my god I've become a fucking maniac.
3553520	3556160	I'm sorry yeah that's how soft will you turn out to be okay.
3557520	3562320	I know what this is about. You're pissed because you don't have your privacy anymore.
3563440	3566640	You think that I made up this whole decaying tree thing just to stalk you.
3568480	3571760	I can see right through you especially now that all the trees have gone.
3573120	3583600	Days later I think days later October 1st from now on I'm going to yell up to your window and say
3583600	3592240	hi Dan. It's my way of saying it's a beautiful day don't you think? Three days later hi Dan.
3592240	3596400	My Dan and I were thinking of dropping by your podcast today to talk about the eucalyptus trees.

3627120	3631600	Beth she signed it so that in case I'm like who's this?
3633360	3636160	The woman I just threatened to push a pencil through.
3638480	3643280	And then Dan writes yes but we don't need to include Aaron in this conversation anymore
3643280	3648720	we're divorcing. I'm going to connect you to my assistant Steve Levy who books the show
3648720	3654720	and makes sure the guests have all the right information. Okay and then let's see his email
3655440	3660320	can I give him yours? Of course mine is blah blah blah. I thought you two were just living together.
3663600	3667520	I'm so sorry to hear about the divorce that's always a difficult thing to go through.
3669760	3675920	That's me yeah you do that's you reading me yeah yeah.
3675920	3679520	Oh you perceived right we were just living together.
3679920	3683280	Oh that's why it didn't make sense to stay married.
3683920	3687120	I'll give your email to Steve and have him contact you tomorrow.
3687760	3690880	We'll only have okay wait hold on hold on.
3693760	3697280	This next part Aaron's. Oh yeah and then Aaron comes in for the closer here.
3699680	3704000	Thank you Beth. Truth be told our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus trees came.
3709520	3720080	Wait wait thank you Beth. Truth be told our marriage was fine until the eucalyptus
3720080	3724080	trees came down because it turns out I was just in it for the shade.
3725600	3727200	Aaron McGathey ladies and gentlemen.
3727200	3745680	Okay so in the green room just to put a ribbon on this so like I said the audience is on your side
3745680	3749360	they're reacting to the size of the tree or I don't know the amount of decay. I still don't
3749360	3756320	understand how old they are. I never noticed them. I live in a world of just dirty underwear and
3756320	3761680	sadness. I actually think that now that that that wall of eucalyptus trees is down
3763120	3769120	and you've lost your privacy and you're looking down into our yard you don't have that wall of
3769120	3778720	privacy anymore and there's there's there's big stumps of ugliness there now so. Yeah the neighbors
3778720	3781760	shouldn't be separated. I had eucalyptus trees around my heart. But you might have never bought
3781760	3787200	your house if there was no privacy there. I don't know but well uh I don't know about that
3787200	3790720	honestly. I looked in the backyard and I was like oh so green and there's a grill.
3791360	3796320	And the eucalyptus trees were there. I think if I yeah maybe because if I yeah okay well we'll
3796320	3800880	talk about that later but well anyway I feel like if I had realized like how many steps there were
3800880	3803920	I wouldn't have bought the house so obviously I don't notice things that normal people notice
3803920	3809360	like the UPS guy's like what the fuck man. Right right. And I'm like oh shit okay. Well I I want
3809360	3817040	to tell you that you know I sent out those same photos to all the neighborhood and people
3819600	3827040	at first were like us very very upset that these beautiful trees had to be cut down. But then
3827040	3832400	afterwards when they saw how much decay there was they were shocked and then they were asking about.
3833360	3841120	My tree. Yeah these trees are 100 year old 100 years old. Right before we were um going to cut
3841120	3848000	the trees down um we've had the same tree trimmer for many many years now. And um I wouldn't have
3848000	3855440	had I wouldn't have had anybody else trim them because he knows the trees. And go ahead you know
3855440	3860800	and it's not that I'm a tree lover. Shit is real yo when you are a homeowner this shit is important.
3861040	3867120	So don't fucking judge or I will come in and I will hit you in the head with this fucking microphone.
3868960	3875840	Well and here's the thing it's not that I'm a tree lover or tree hugger it's that these were
3875840	3881920	when I looked out my bedroom window these trees were right there and our house is small and these
3881920	3888960	trees um were a focal point. So and we've lived in that house for 20 years. Now we're the small house
3888960	3897200	in the shadow of Dan Harmon's palatial uh stage. And these these trees were probably about seven
3897200	3906160	stories high and they were 100 years old and now we look up at this. I will I will build a statue
3906160	3915360	to your trees and it will spray cranberry juice for the neighborhood's children. Well I just want
3915360	3920560	to say that. So you told me in the green room oh what were you going to say? Yes um right before
3920560	3927760	we cut the trees down. Oh boy okay here we go. Yeah I was uh this was a very um um upsetting
3927760	3935520	thing to me but right before we cut the trees down um I actually had a service or gave homage
3935520	3944000	to these trees. And you're and you're and you said can I can can I please read the poem I read
3944080	3944880	at the service.
3949920	3955760	And you're currently for for our listeners you are as broken up as one of these tower records people
3955760	3960640	like and it's me talking about my divorce like you're you're crying genuine tears. Beth loves
3960640	3966720	these trees and I'm a horrible heartless maniac that cannot fucking like I cannot see in these
3966720	3974480	colors. I do want to say that you identified with the trees. Unwittingly unwittingly keep
3974480	3979200	that in mind when I read this poem. Yes this tonight's theme is about loss and yes uprooting
3979200	3989600	and okay my trees blue gum eucalyptus four of them so tall so majestic I've always been proud that
3989600	3996400	those trees were mine fighting through the harsh environment standing tall and proud for over 100
3996480	4004080	years those trees belong to me they provided shelter when the sun was beating down and when
4004080	4010800	the winds would show no mercy yet it was after the storm that they were at their most fragrant
4011440	4019920	it was like walking into a spa especially after a big rain the life that existed in them raccoons
4020000	4029280	possums skunks the chatter of the squirrels that mocked my dog why even the hawks made their home
4029280	4037360	there a nest built on the strong branches of my eucalyptus trees a nest holding three large babies
4037360	4045760	and the parents and I got to see my hawks grow and I got to see my hawks fly and I got to see
4045760	4054480	my hawks soar the cold winters the hot summers the powerful winds nothing could break those trees
4055280	4063840	and to think that those trees belong to me and to think that those trees my trees will now be gone
4063840	4076480	but with every end comes a new beginning with great love Beth and Tamoor
4076880	4083120	oh
4086560	4091920	someone just someone just called out give her your tree if that is possible
4092800	4099360	if that's possible biologically or legally you it is your tree I don't know where it is on my property
4100160	4104880	is it the thing with the green stuff there's a million trees back there
4105680	4110800	that was beautiful Beth and I I probably don't have to acknowledge this but rather want people

4273600	4278800	episode it's fantastic and all the people that they have in it are great it's cool so it's like
4278800	4284320	it's like um i don't know it's like if you wanted to do like the marvel universe thing
4284320	4289360	with the Coen brothers that's what it is i can't think of a of a worse idea on paper
4290080	4295200	on paper i know on paper i was like i can't it is truly like that could have been some
4295200	4301200	fucking horrible fan fiction dude it really could have been but uh Noah Hawley for whatever reason
4301200	4307680	that dude uh is on like another level you know if Paul McCartney said there are seven levels he's
4307680	4313200	on like the eighth or maybe the seventh um and he wrote that first season of Fargo which was
4313200	4318240	really great that was sort of had a brief connection to the movie but yet existed in its
4318240	4326480	own right and this next season is was alluded to multiple times in the first season and so
4327360	4335440	Lou Solverson who owned the cafe who um Carradine played in the first season he is now played by
4335440	4342960	Patrick Wilson and it shows his whole experience as a sheriff in a completely different town
4343920	4350320	and it's a supposedly badass i've seen the first episode it's great and i'm i cannot wait for the
4350320	4355440	second episode i gotta get and i've been waiting fucking months for the second episode i'm so
4355440	4360480	upset that i had to wait on the show i mean he was that he was a he was a he was a pilot brother
4360480	4364960	when i was doing the pilot for community he was doing a pilot for i can't remember the name of
4364960	4369600	it now it was like some like it was on abc like it was called like the unknowables or yeah
4369600	4375840	generation or something like that yeah ex ex other people or something other people's exes yeah um
4375840	4382160	and and i got together with him for a round of drinks and and i as we talked about he's he's
4382160	4387440	kind of hard to read yeah i don't know if having him on the show will be uh uh will make me secure
4387440	4393360	about myself but i but i think no but your your your your guys's verbal knowledge you will be you
4393360	4397360	guys will be able to communicate in a way i don't know if anyone else will understand it but
4397360	4402560	but the two of you don't oversell it he i don't know he could just be like a eucalyptus tree
4402560	4409280	it's just dead on the inside and by that i mean fascinating uh as it turns out artists dead on the
4409280	4415840	inside and yet fascinating i love when they they brought the circular stump that they had been
4415840	4421520	sending me pictures of and everyone went whoa and i was like okay i'm the monster you really
4421520	4427680	should i was just looking at you really should post like screen grabs of that that conversation

4433520	4439520	through this i had no idea what they were going to do and i just here start scrolling through a
4439520	4444960	very long text conversation and i said well this is going to be very interesting because she's
4444960	4449600	clearly not at all interested in what's happening right now and is very interested in this text
4449600	4454480	conversation that was brilliant yeah it was great turned out great yeah it had a beginning

4585760	4589920	i'm just i'm just an artist you know like i'm just trying to just live off of my art so what is that
4589920	4594400	lifestyle how does it work because i had to stand up when i was a kid it's not delivery it's the
4594400	4599440	struggle for sure um like it's just i'm very hungry all the time i'm frustrated every i can
4599440	4606640	look at anything thank you other guy right there your eviction notice too for sure yeah i know right
4608640	4614960	that guy's going like this right just so you know i mean he's playing it off but the guy's like
4614960	4620800	oh no no well off no but this is frustrating i'm always hungry and stuff like that um i never have
4620800	4627520	any gas um i i always try to find a story in something so if i see just like a kid crying
4627520	4632480	about their ice cream i need to find a social political turmoil about how america is just some
4632480	4637600	one kid crying about their ice cream i'm actually actually writing a song about foot fetishes so are
4637600	4643040	you are you thinking in rhymes when you look at that kid yeah sometimes you're like cone alone
4643760	4654800	yeah exactly you know why america got boned uh 900 number phone yeah okay but i won't i won't
4654800	4662560	keep bragging the uh but that's very interesting because i've talked to like like like i had dinner
4662560	4668240	with ben folds once humble brag and i uh and i because what i find interesting about musicians
4668240	4674080	is that they like i have i have like dialogue in my head all the time like like like it's i i
4674080	4678480	imagine myself i don't want to flatter myself or offend anybody who has a legitimate mental illness
4678480	4683040	but i when you hear about like voices in your head i always think like there's got to be like
4683040	4688160	one drop of chemical difference in the brain between like a writer who's good at dialogue and
4688160	4692640	like somebody who's setting themselves on fire because they can't stop like the voices in their
4692640	4696960	head because i just like i'm just used to it it's just one of those like like i just always hear
4697600	4702080	talking talking talking talking talking and when people are talking to me i see their words
4702080	4705680	in front of my face blah blah blah i talked to ben folds and i'm like what is what the fuck are
4705680	4710400	musicians how does that work and he said like he can't he has the same thing but it's melodies
4710400	4714960	which is so weird to me because to me melodies are a thing you make up like you go down to the
4714960	4719600	ditch and you're just like oh i need a melody but that's how other people feel about writing
4719600	4723120	and he feels that way he's like i can't stop thinking of this melody i can't get it out of
4723120	4726960	my head which i've heard from like paul mccartney and stuff like that in interviews you're saying
4726960	4733680	that in interviews he said interviews he said in interviews you were so quick on the humble brag
4734320	4741520	thank you so quick on the trigger in interviews with the maca
4744000	4747920	with the paul maca as he's called in brazil
4750160	4754720	colin hanks is like exhausted having just been promoting his documentary probably all week and
4754720	4762160	he has to come here and like defend me from i was he was very quick on the humble brag yo
4762160	4766640	i really thank you for doing that but no the thing you're talking about the thing you're
4766640	4772400	talking about that there's a very big difference between crazy and insane you can deal with a
4772400	4777920	crazy artist because they're constantly focused on whatever it is that their their brain needs
4777920	4782720	to focus on whether it's words or melody whatever they're crazy because they they they hear melodies
4782720	4789440	all the time whereas insane is just a fucking insane person well you're always connecting
4789440	4793360	things but here's the thing when i listen to like m&m lyrics i'm like this guy must have been born
4793360	4797520	in a generation where it's like oh because of hip-hop culture that came before him and because
4797520	4803040	of maybe something in his brain like he's thinking phonetically because he rhymes shit that i'm like
4803040	4808640	that didn't rhyme until you made it rhyme do you do you think in rhymes do you hear rhymes in your
4808640	4816080	head i definitely do um i mean how i usually kind of start like my like the process is every song
4816080	4819760	i do is a story so the first thing i do is i just think about what the story is going to be
4819760	4823120	about so i always have to make sure i have a beginning and middle and the end and i always
4823120	4831280	have to write out i always have the right call back that's a callback thank you you want to tell
4831280	4835120	story you're saying so what so taking us back to the cube the ice cream cone you're saying when you
4835120	4840400	look at the cube the ice cream cone you're like i want to do i want to rap about that yeah yeah
4840400	4844880	pretty much like if i see a kid like like like say if he drops the ice cream the first thing
4844880	4849280	i'm thinking about was this kid must have had like my story was he had a shitty day no one wanted
4849280	4854080	to like pick him for kickball his graham crackers were too soggy and all this other shit and all
4854080	4857760	he really fucking wanted was just that chocolate chip icing from thrifty he was so excited got
4857760	4862880	the store and then he tripped on something he's like fuck you know i'm saying like my saving grace
4862880	4866800	and now i'm going to destroy my teddy bear because i don't know what else to do that's pretty much
4866800	4871600	how i'm going to put my story because i feel like um i feel like there's like a twisted bittersweet
4871600	4875280	thing and anyone's like moral of the story of the day like you have the greatest day possible but i
4875280	4879680	feel like something about your day is a bittersweet so i always try to make sure i end every note of
4879680	4885760	my song in a bittersweet lyrical funny way so like bittersweet would be an example would be like
4886720	4894000	so he doesn't get any more ice cream but like uh but he's gonna lose weight yeah pretty much yeah
4894000	4898640	like like the moral stories he's not gonna be diabetic you know what i'm saying so i mean yeah
4899280	4905440	i guess this diabetes will come a year later later later later and that's like that's like
4905440	4911040	the and then it goes into some weird sketch you with you and your friends in a car yeah it's like
4911040	4915840	smoking a lot of marijuana looking at the kid who like who said oh shade your ice cream as we all
4915840	4920000	have ice cream bro like aha we have money we're adults we have jobs we just buy something else
4920000	4924480	i can never figure out how i feel about those comedy sketches that rappers do on their albums
4924480	4928320	like i'm like i'm like on one hand i don't want you to stop but on the other hand you really need
4928320	4935120	to take a workshop oh this is this is insane it's all kind of depends it's one of those things to
4935120	4939840	where it's just like everyone wants to be something that like was like when you have like movie stars
4939840	4944080	who want to be singers like Jennifer Lopez she did Selena she was like fuck i have a great voice
4944080	4948000	and she was like i'm going to go ahead and be a singer when you have like actors or if you have
4948000	4952000	like rappers or singers who are like you know what i'm gonna go into acting and you go when you're
4952000	4955440	like you know what i'm really not that great of an actor but i'm gonna still keep on doing it so
4955440	4959120	it's kind of like the same thing with the skits you know i don't have very funny skits i actually
4959120	4964720	have a very very corny skit with my girlfriend in it where this is about like going on a shopping
4964720	4971520	spree at uh swap meet and it's it's so corny and like we're still proud of it till this day and
4971520	4974800	stuff like we feel like we're like comedic geniuses when people look at it they're like
4975360	4981920	so is this a swap meet skit and i'm like yeah it's funny it's her birthday it's a $60 shopping
4981920	4986240	spree she won the purse was five dollars over go for it and that same reaction you guys are
4986240	4991680	i have right now that's the exact same feeling i get hey you know my mother my dad while my
4991680	4995280	friend you never know when you're gonna hit the gold mine that is a decaying eucalyptus trade
4995280	4999920	yeah exactly like you don't know what what what the people are going to consider an important story
4999920	5007680	um all right so when you battle mothers uh do you do it sitting and do you do we got i got two i got
5007680	5013600	two beats from our man zack in the booth we've uh there's a there's a slower one and a faster one
5014400	5019280	like like like do you want to sit do you want to do you want to be congenial do we need to like
5019280	5026800	move the seats out and like do it in the center have you battled ever before really yeah this
5026800	5030160	how does that work that was the thing i was trying to ask you when i said about the lifestyle like
5030160	5033920	how does that work when i was 17 i started i was like i'm gonna be a comedian so there was this
5034000	5039440	whole thing going there was open mics and i like it was like this weird um it was this whole
5039440	5045440	culture but i was like i have no if i was supposed to write a movie about like like how what the
5045440	5050240	hell does that look like what do you do you go to a place do you put your hat in the name and a hat
5050240	5056000	and then they bring you up um i mean like you didn't do like open mics or something like that

5463760	5468640	rhyme with the feet you like you do you just rhyme it's just kind of sporadically just as soon as
5468640	5473600	you hear a word you just start rhyming it i'm like i don't think i don't think i would you like to go
5473680	5477200	without a beat it's actually pretty fun you can kind of make it

5839600	5847360	no thanks i was in a i played bass in a band in college that fancied itself as a live hip-hop group
5848640	5854160	this is a horrible thing to fancy themselves and we called ourselves the underlords
5855680	5864480	such a horrible name for a band so bad that the guy who was recording our demo labeled us the
5864480	5871440	overlords and he said over under doesn't matter it doesn't it does not matter you're a band first
5871440	5876080	and then said let's try rapping that was the beastie boy i was not oh well no i just played
5876080	5881120	bass i was just the quiet bass player that's you're like leave me out of this yeah i'm just
5881120	5887600	off to the side playing a bass and uh on that little demo that we made the one thing that you
5887600	5895280	cannot hear is the bass um yeah so this isn't something you kept no i still have it oh you do
5895280	5900000	so i still have it it's really bad it's really bad no you can't listen to any of it okay
5901840	5906000	i want to make sure i'm just going to check my microsoft one note i gotta go to the bathroom
5906000	5912160	real quick i'll be right back he's got to make a little poopers oh there is one it's been sitting
5912160	5919920	here the entire time watching all of this he's a professional i think we're about to get to his
5919920	5929680	part of the show and he goes i gotta go to the bathroom doesn't even wait to announce i gotta go
5931520	5939200	and does it like just leaps there's no permission oh he's you know he's really gone to his head no
5939200	5944080	he's he's he's doing it for free so but he got to executive produce i would hope he's shitting
5944080	5948400	for free i mean if you were charging him that would be really bad i mean the game mastering
5948400	5953520	oh there's one thing we'll talk until he gets back um the the dave girl is in your documentary
5953520	5958640	and he's because as a person who was i don't know just one of many people that we recognize these
5958640	5966880	days who who is in documentaries thinking that he's in a lot of documentaries he made all of his
5966880	5971680	in the time it took so he talks about the fact that the appeal of tower records was the snobbery
5971680	5975520	basically not to put too fine a point on it but that's and i've always been fascinated with that
5975520	5981280	idea because i've never i think i enact a lot of snobbery without realizing i'm doing it but i've
5981280	5987200	never been patient for it at all is that like like what what is that like the people like the
5987200	5992000	idea that they like to go to record stores and be given a hard time or did back then yeah so like
5992000	5996560	with grole there's a very specific reason why i put grole in the documentary because everyone was
5996560	6000320	like when we released the trailer there were some people that were like oh great david grole
6000320	6006640	is in another documentary about music like that per the rules he just has a he just has a kit
6006640	6011040	every documentary about music that is just him is just clips of him saying you have to understand
6011040	6017280	that at the time nobody had heard anything like this and it's just it could be about anything
6017760	6024400	it's like clip art it could be anything but very specifically he actually worked at tower records
6024400	6030240	before he was in nirvana he worked at a tower records in washington d.c so i specifically went
6030240	6035760	after him because i knew that he worked there and he uh he talked a lot about the fact that
6035760	6042880	a lot of the people that uh that worked at music stores at record stores have a a tendency to be
6042880	6048480	pretty snobbish they haven't been i i have to tell you i was i would i can't wait to see this
6048480	6054080	because the tower that was here on sunset boulevard when i moved here in 83 yeah which is i think was
6054080	6059680	the year it opened uh it opened in on sunset around there it opened in the 70s but it opened
6059680	6066880	for you in 1983 that's right it was in new york was in 1980 anyway but the the reason that i can't
6066880	6074080	wait to see it is because i never encountered that i never encountered snobbery and i lived
6074080	6080160	in that tower record for years i was there constantly yeah and and and one of the things
6080160	6087120	that i thought was so sorry about the whole thing going south was that there was a social
6087120	6093760	environment there yeah which everyone has lost yes as a result of going to mp3s yeah no i always
6093760	6097920	sort of say that there's there are two things that are missing now that these stores have a
6097920	6102080	tendency to not really exist and i'm saying this knowing full well that we're in the back of a
6102080	6107200	comic store where this happens every day but there are two things that are that happen a is there's
6107200	6112560	the social interaction between people at the stores who are going through bins and seeing what
6112560	6116320	the other person is doing and maybe there's a connection there that can be made or there's
6116320	6120800	at least some sort of connection being made between the person that is taking the money
6120800	6126720	and the person that is giving the money the only difference now is that i don't remember
6127600	6133600	what i was doing when i downloaded some song there's no there's no special moment of like oh
6133840	6139200	i'm about to download this that is going to change my life or like man i remember where
6139200	6142960	i was when i downloaded this but i remember where i was when i bought an album that
6143600	6148720	meant a great deal to me exactly and that is something that is uh somewhat special at least
6148720	6154400	to me and so it's notable to to notice the lack of that but it's also like i mean let's be honest i
6154400	6158240	mean we could you could say you could say the same thing about making bread or something like
6158320	6163840	like people people used to have to uh you know well we need a loaf of bread so i guess i know
6163840	6168560	what i'm doing wednesday you know and then and then and then once bread started to be made by
6168560	6174000	other people you know it's like oh we lost wednesday when we when when when bread started
6174000	6179600	to get streamlined we lost our wednesdays you know it's and it's true but it's not necessarily good
6179600	6186800	or bad it's it and i feel i do again i do feel like like in that documentary i always i often
6186800	6190480	feel this way about documentaries but people that contributed so much to popular culture
6191120	6196080	they beat up on themselves so much in the third acts like they're like oh but we could have never
6196080	6200400	known that was going to be the end of everything did you see the paul williams documentary yeah
6200960	6207280	that guy is so hard on himself yeah for being one of the most amazing people for all of everything
6207280	6212800	in the 70s and being one of the most inspiring interesting people it's like this diminutive guy
6212800	6218160	that just experimented kind of like beth bootson with the idea of like like i'm here mocking her
6218160	6222640	and she's like i'm gonna be bulletproof i don't care i'm so at peace with myself or just all i
6222640	6228960	care about is is whether you're okay and so this tiny little guy who was a brilliant songwriter
6229520	6235200	and and and like wrote all of these hits he he all of a sudden he's like becomes like this amazing
6235200	6240800	celebrity and it wasn't because there weren't taller more handsome people available it was
6240800	6246320	because people loved him because he was so unflappable and so sincere and yeah it was the
6246320	6253440	70s so he did a bunch of coke and drank and this the documentary kind of follows him looking back
6253440	6256960	on those days and in the end of it i just i felt like i had to tweet him and go like you're too
6256960	6262000	too hard on yourself man it's like so what you rubbed your nose during the dick cabbage show
6262000	6267600	like what the fuck like like you were great like this and he wrote back like yeah but i have to
6267600	6273360	find peace and grace and all this stuff it's it's just like no be drunk again with me no no no i i
6273360	6276720	i don't know what it's like you don't want to you don't want to fuck with that shit but i feel like
6276720	6280960	people are too hard on themselves in these documentaries where it's like yeah we did this
6280960	6285120	thing and then like what was tower records supposed to do the important thing that i
6285120	6289840	oh the the most important thing that i kept trying to remind myself was the fact that i was
6289840	6295680	being interested to tell these people's stories and so when i see things and when i see documentaries
6295680	6299680	and people are being too hard on themselves i go no they should be hard on themselves because it
6299680	6306800	was their lives this is what they did for better for worse this is what they did and a lot of times
6306800	6311280	especially when you get into these scenarios where documentaries are talking about you know
6311280	6315440	people that dedicated their lives to something they will spend the rest of their lives wondering
6315440	6321120	what they could have done differently and um and we gave the people that worked at tower a chance
6321200	6327040	to be able to talk about that and to sort of maybe just maybe give them an opportunity to
6327040	6331360	sort of get them you know get that off their chest and you capture really powerful moments
6331360	6335680	wait what's your relationship between acting and i mean now you're now you what does it take to
6335680	6339280	direct a documentary and what how does that compare to because you can just show up to a
6339280	6343120	place and have your own trailer and have people put makeup on your face and go yeah that shit's
6343120	6349360	really nice i'm not gonna lie that's really nice when people are like hey be funny and like wear
6349360	6354480	makeup and pretend to be someone else that's a nice day job to have and i really enjoy doing it
6354480	6363440	and i got a new show now um it's called thanks a lot it's called thanks a lot super great um no but
6363440	6370480	i like that is really fun for nothing thanks for nothing thanks for the memories um boy there's a
6370480	6375840	lot of they're all involved with thanks don't they yeah i'm not pretty much all do no um but like
6375840	6380320	with the with the documentary thing it was really uh something that i started doing because
6380320	6386000	i wasn't working because i couldn't find any acting work and i'm not a writer i don't pretend
6386000	6397280	to be a writer a lot of actors do um ouch um oh wait but um no basically it was it was a chance
6397280	6402320	for me to do something else creative and and i needed some sort of outlet and so this doc proved
6402320	6408480	to be it and since i started making it i've done a couple of other ones and i'm not uh pretending
6408480	6413200	to be a documentary filmmaker this was just one story that i really wanted to tell and i was lucky
6413200	6419360	enough to well you did swell at it yeah uh it's it's it's it's really on friday and then you know
6420240	6426480	and we can we can talk for the next three hours about certain like like like the what it is like
