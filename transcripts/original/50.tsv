0	23720	Hello Meltdown, how are you tonight?
23720	25840	Just as I expected.
25840	26840	Guess what?
26840	32400	This town is in session, but not just any Harman Town, this is our 50th episode rather
32400	35640	of Harman Town.
35640	42360	Wow, it seems like only yesterday for the very first time I announced the mayor of Harman
42360	43360	Town.
43360	52480	Welcome to the stage for the 50th time, Stan Harman!
52480	66480	You're a comptroller, Jeff Jamis, wow.
66480	67480	Hello.
67480	75240	49, 49 times before now, I never thank you enough.
75240	76320	Thank you.
76320	79480	You thank me simply by being my friend, Dan, that's all I need from you.
79480	80960	That's good, that's good to know.
80960	84280	All right, ma'am, would you please have a seat?
84280	88440	This is my girlfriend, always late.
88440	91760	How many episodes in was she your girlfriend, do you think?
91760	93280	I have a terrible memory.
93280	94600	Not for all 50 for sure.
94600	95600	No way, right?
95600	96600	Yeah.
96600	103520	Oh, so it's not 50 Harman Town, just 50 podcast episodes, because yeah, we've been doing this
103520	106440	for 17 years.
106440	107440	Yeah.
107440	108840	There was a whole phantom zone.
108880	115000	We still have all these things we keep threatening to release archives of the old recordings before
115000	116720	we even thought this would be a podcast.
116720	118520	Yeah, but we'd sound all young.
118520	119520	Yeah.
119520	123200	And we'd be talking about Beetlejuice.
123200	125360	We still talk about Beetlejuice.
125360	129400	Back then we were talking about it because it was just about to come out though.
129400	130400	We got a lot of stuff to do.
130400	131400	I'm sorry.
131400	135720	Hey, oh, here's item number one on the docket, I'm assuming, I wouldn't ask this for any other
135720	136720	audience.
137720	144240	I feel like if there's a hundred people here, the answer might be, there's a 2% chance of
144240	145240	being yes.
145240	146240	Does anyone have a five hour energy?
146240	147240	No.
147240	148240	Okay.
148240	149240	All right.
149240	151240	Does anyone have a 20-sided die?
151240	152240	Yes.
152240	153240	Okay, see?
153240	154240	All right.
154240	155240	It's still my crowd.
155240	156240	It's still my crowd.
156240	160880	Yeah, I'm feeling a little sluggish, but I'm going to force a manic behavior.
160880	163880	I listen to the episodes, Jeff, I like the ones where I'm manic.
163880	165360	I don't like the depressive ones.
165600	168120	Well, why don't we send somebody off to the liquor store down the road?
168120	170560	Because then they'll miss the show and they come here and they want to see me.
170560	172480	But that portion of the show is going to be shitty.
172480	173480	The depressive portion.
173480	174480	Yeah.
174480	175480	That's an off-brand.
175480	176480	Wow.
176480	177480	Wait, come up here, Sherry.
177480	178480	Come up here.
178480	187080	A gentleman just came on stage, handed Dan what he referred to as an off-brand five hour
187080	188080	energy.
188080	189080	Yeah.
189080	191120	Is that why you didn't say yes when I asked for a five hour energy?
191120	194600	I wasn't sure if I had it in my bag because I just flew and I wasn't sure if I had it
194840	195840	in there.
195840	196840	What's your name, sir?
196840	197840	I'm Chris Dunford.
197840	198840	Chris Dunford.
198840	199840	All right.
199840	200840	Fake name.
200840	202840	Totally my real name.
202840	215960	Just in town to do some raping and using my ID from Denmark and it says Grape Kirkland
215960	216960	Energy Shot.
216960	220240	Should we do a commercial for it?
220240	221240	Thank you so much.
221240	222240	Okay.
222240	223600	Kirkland Energy Shot.
223600	229320	The number one energy drink of an anonymous rapist.
229320	230320	That's a fact.
230320	234480	I'm Alec Baldwin for, what's it called?
234480	235480	Grape Kirkland?
235480	236480	Yeah.
236480	240480	Grape Kirkland Energy Shot.
240480	241480	For real?
241480	242480	Yeah.
242480	244520	So, Dan's trying it.
244520	246480	Does it taste just as shit as five hour energy?
246480	247480	Yeah.
247480	248480	It tastes better.
248480	249480	That means it's probably working less.
249480	250480	All right.
251200	252200	It tastes good.
252200	253200	Yeah.
253200	256040	This will only last, well, at this point, 20 minutes and then I'll drop dead.
256040	258360	I keep compiling these.
258360	261960	I've adopted these in place of Adderall, Street Adderall.
261960	265120	And what was your name again, Barry Dunford?
265120	266480	Chris Dunford.
266480	267480	Chris Dunford.
267480	269200	And where do you hail from, Chris?
269200	271160	I'm from Boston area.
271160	272160	Yeah?
272160	273160	Yeah.
273160	276320	And what brings you to Harman Town?
276320	279520	Well, it's my grandma's 80th birthday this week.
279520	280520	It all sounds so fake.
280520	281520	It sounds so fake.
281520	284920	Not a trace of a Boston accent.
284920	286600	Chris Dunford from Boston.
286600	288600	It's my grandma's 80th birthday.
288600	291600	I enjoy potatoes and skateboarding.
291600	296240	I swear to God, I'm not working for area 51.
296240	298280	I can neither confirm or deny that.
298280	300960	So, your grandmother passed away in Los Angeles?
300960	304000	No, she's 80 years old.
304000	305520	She did the opposite of passed away.
305520	306520	Oh, sorry.
306520	307520	She's still going.
307520	308520	She lived for 80 years.
308520	309520	Unless things have changed.
309520	310520	No.
310520	311520	Guys, I've been watching a lot of Columbo.
311520	313520	I was trying to catch him in a lie.
313520	314520	One more thing.
314520	315520	What's your grandma's funeral?
315520	316520	I'm sorry.
316520	317520	Oh, Tuesday?
317520	318520	Oh!
318520	319520	I don't know why you said...
319520	320520	You know what?
320520	321520	Chris, one thing bothers me.
321520	325080	If she's 80, why are you burying her?
325080	327920	No, I'm not passing it.
327920	331880	Although one thing alarms me, I think I drank one of these three hours ago.
331880	332880	For real?
332880	333880	Let's see what happens.
333880	334880	But a different brand.
334880	335880	Different brands.
335880	336880	It's okay.
336880	337880	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
338240	346360	So, Chris, you're visiting from Boston to see your still alive 80-year-old grandmother.
346360	347360	That is correct, yes.
347360	349680	That you plan on murdering soon.
349680	350680	Only for the parents.
350680	353240	Right now, is she being killed by Ray Meland?
353240	355440	And this is to establish your alibi?
355440	357560	This is all about alibi establishment, isn't it?
357560	359160	That would have been a really good idea, actually.
359160	360480	But no, I don't believe so.
360480	361960	I've been watching too much Columbo, you guys.
361960	362960	What was the movie I just saw?
362960	363960	It was a Kevin Costner movie.
363960	364960	Mr. Collins?
364960	365960	What was the...
365960	366960	Mr. Brooks?
367040	370880	What if the way he looked right now was all in elaborate disguise?
370880	375200	Underneath that, he's Seth Rogen, and he's gonna...
375200	381040	Kevin Costner, at one point, to get his daughter out of a murder charge, he boards a plane,
381040	385360	puts on a fake goatee, and has kind of a long mullet wig and a denim jacket, goes and hatchet
385360	387360	murders someone, comes back.
387360	388360	Spoilers.
388360	389360	Yeah, I was about to say it.
389360	390360	Spoiler alert on that one.
390360	392120	Hey, here's another general spoiler.
392120	396240	If Kevin Costner's in it, oh, boy.
396240	397240	Careful.
397240	398240	Bull Durham, man.
398240	399240	Bull Durham's a goodie.
399240	400240	Bull Durham was a goodie.
400240	401240	Tin cup.
401240	402240	Tin cup and we're...
402240	403240	Tin cup is a goodie.
403240	404240	I finally saw it.
404240	405240	I finally saw it.
405240	407280	We had a little Kevin Costner marathon.
407280	411120	It's a golf movie with Kevin Costner and Rene Russo.
411120	413320	There's no way you're gonna like that movie.
413320	414320	That's got everything going on.
414320	415320	There's no way you're gonna watch it.
415320	416320	No, no, it's not.
416320	417400	But here's the thing.
417400	418400	It's profound.
418400	421120	Don Johnson is an awesome bad guy in it.
421120	424640	Don Johnson's agents in the audience?
424640	427720	That's the third time he said that tonight.
427720	431560	He just finished saying it at a pizzeria down the street.
431560	432720	Here's your pepperoni.
432720	434280	You forgot about Don Johnson.
434280	436040	Hey, look.
436040	438400	I'm not paid to remember him.
438400	443920	I think that stuff kicked in pretty quick.
443920	446680	It's a profound sports movie.
446680	450240	It's not a good movie in the strictest sense.
450240	451880	Well, it's Kevin Costner movie.
451960	453280	I love the position you've been putting in.
453280	457920	You're sitting here nodding about tin cup.
457920	461200	I just love the homogeneity of the people we bring on stage.
461200	462640	Any one of you could be Harmon.
462640	466640	Chris, how was your trip to Los Angeles?
466640	468120	Was it wicked retarded?
471880	474720	Hold my wicked hand.
474720	476160	Don't be retarded.
476160	477600	Come in.
477600	479640	My grandma's actually not from Boston.
479640	480640	Oh, OK.
480880	483800	I was born in LA, but.
483800	485040	All right, well, OK.
485040	487560	Throw me under the bus.
487560	489320	Tin cup's fucking good, Chris.
489320	489680	Chris?
489680	490280	Is it Chris?
490280	490560	Carl?
490560	490960	It's Chris.
490960	492640	Chris is in the back of the nose.
492640	494040	It's good.
494040	496720	It's a philosophically profound sports movie.
499880	503000	It comes down to going for it or laying up.
503000	505920	I really identified with the Kevin Costner character.
505920	507440	He loves going for it.
507440	508440	He's self-destructive.
508440	510280	He's impulsive.
510880	512040	I can't spoil the movie.
512040	513040	You have to watch the whole thing.
513040	515240	But right when it comes down to that last moment when he's
515240	516640	in the US Open, that's not the plan.
516640	518520	Don't spoil it, for real.
518520	520560	I defy you, if you've never seen that movie,
520560	522800	to write the end of that movie better than they write the end
522800	523080	of that movie.
523080	524480	I defy you to write a sports movie
524480	527160	and try to get your way around the idea
527160	528880	that in the third act of a sports movie,
528880	532000	either the people that you love have to win or lose.
532000	534160	And if they lose, it's a fucking bad movie
534160	535440	because you love them.
535440	536440	So why would they lose?
536440	538680	Or they have to win, in which case it's a shitty movie
538680	541160	because you knew they were going to win.
541160	543440	There's only a couple movies that get around that.
543440	548280	And obviously Teen Wolf has won, but.
548280	551280	Are you saying Teen Wolf is mostly a basketball film?
551280	552280	It definitely is.
552280	555640	There's a, OK.
555640	557760	How many minutes of that movie are spent with anyone
557760	559360	being a werewolf?
559360	560960	Well, all the basketball minutes,
560960	562160	and then some other ones too.
562160	566000	No, there's a huge, huge lion's share of that movie
566000	567080	is basketball.
567080	567800	It doesn't matter.
567800	568880	Who cares?
568880	569440	It's hitting me.
569440	570040	It's hitting me.
570040	571480	I saw a tweet today.
571480	573160	Somebody fun fact that Kirkland County's
573160	576440	grape, grape, grape shot, whiff of grape shot is hitting me.
576440	578960	Somebody fun fact that on Twitter, that space jam
578960	580960	that we really got into last week
580960	585400	is the number one basketball film of all time.
585400	587280	By what metric?
587280	588280	Money?
588280	590480	By your precious money?
590480	592800	I don't doubt it.
592800	593960	It's certainly box office.
593960	597060	When you pool together all the fucking
597060	603380	ducats, like exchange, like plush bugs bunnies
603380	607420	with holding basketballs on Universal City Walk, who cares?
607420	608060	It's vile.
608060	609940	It's a vile practice.
609940	611020	Make a good movie.
617060	620700	Gene Hackman from Hoosiers is here tonight.
620700	624780	I thought that was my, what's the guy from the Scrooge story?
624780	626940	Jacobs, Jacob Marley?
627940	630260	I thought I could only hear that clap.
630260	632180	It was like, it's my dad in the back.
632180	634260	Way to go, Harmon.
634260	638700	Way to let space jam have it.
638700	640620	This is what your careers come to.
640620	642420	Sticking it to space jam.
650340	651420	We got a lot to do.
651420	654060	What's your name, Curtis Armstrong?
654060	655300	Something like that.
655300	656140	Carl's bad, Carol?
656940	658940	Chris Dunford.
658940	662820	Thank you so much for giving me a shot of Kirkland's energy
662820	664220	now infused with grape.
664220	671620	It says down here, 10% less MSG.
671620	675580	2% of all proceeds go to the defense of the perimeter
675580	684260	of our compound by the Mormons, the Church of Jesus Christ
684260	685900	of Latter-day Saints.
686380	690180	Chris Humphord Mumperton from everybody.
690180	691620	Can I say one thing real quick?
691620	692500	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
692500	693300	Say whatever you want.
693300	695780	Since she's in the audience, Genevieve, you got robbed.
695780	696820	You should have been the King of America.
696820	698460	Oh, yeah, that's foreshadowing.
698460	699500	Genevieve, you got robbed.
699500	700380	Remember that phrase.
700380	701740	Sorry about that.
701740	705340	Chris Humphord Mumperton.
705340	706940	Thank you, brother.
706940	709020	Well, that was a good segue.
709020	712300	I think Chris made an appropriate segue.
712300	714100	The reason he said that is because there's
714100	716100	someone in the audience that I invited down to the show.
716100	718180	But I don't want to do what I usually do,
718180	720460	which is we bring up a guest, and then I spend so much time
720460	722340	talking that people get uncomfortable
722340	724580	because they're like the person sitting there.
724580	726300	So let me just say a few things about why
726300	728780	we're having her up here.
728780	729660	Last night.
729660	731620	And you promise when she gets up here,
731620	732740	she's going to do all the talking.
732740	735260	It's going to be a fucking cold ass interview, man.
735260	738660	Cool as a cucumber, man.
738740	744660	You're going to be like, is Carson's ghost leaving his?
747740	749740	Well, you'll figure it out.
749740	752180	You'll figure out how to express your wonderment.
752180	754540	I don't think I should have had that five hour interview,
754540	755860	Genevieve.
755860	758100	Dan, you don't look so good, man.
758100	760540	Were there articles about it killing teenagers or something?
760540	761540	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
761540	763020	OK, I'm going to die tonight.
763020	766020	It was invented by the Viet Cong.
766020	769300	You know, out of all the things we thought would kill me,
769300	771500	it will be weird tonight when I die.
771500	773620	An assassin with a fake name comes on stage
773620	780660	and gives you some homemade shit with a fake label on a ree.
780660	783060	Hoo, hoo!
783060	784900	Kirkland.
784900	785500	Wait, he left.
785500	785980	He's gone.
785980	787300	The guy actually is not here anymore.
787300	788540	Yeah, he's not here.
788540	789140	Fake name.
789140	789900	Hold on a second.
789900	790820	Whoa.
790820	792900	Dear Christ.
792900	795220	Harmon accidentally took his shirt off,
795220	798380	and now he's committing to the vet.
798380	799340	What is going on?
801900	804020	Dan, you know what?
804020	805540	You look 50 episodes thinner.
808380	808980	Thank you.
808980	811540	It's just a little hot from energy.
811540	814300	Well, I think it's increased blood flow,
814300	817300	and your capillary networks are fucking freakin' tired right now.
817300	819580	Yeah.
819580	824300	You might be in need of medical assistance.
824300	825900	I think I was before, and I finally got it.
825900	829260	This is what it feels like to be alive.
829260	830100	I'm just waking up.
830100	831700	I'm like Robert De Niro in Awakening.
831700	835460	So I'm like, whoa, whoa, popsicles are interesting.
835460	836060	Freakin' out.
836060	836580	Put me back.
836580	837140	Put me back.
841140	842660	Let's bring her up.
842660	846700	You haven't said anything about it.
846700	851380	You intend to use your cracky, fake, generic energy drink
851380	853820	brain to fucking never let her get a word in.
854820	858500	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
858500	862180	That seems abusive.
862180	865660	I'm teeing up a theatrical moment.
865660	867340	I'm observing the, you know.
867340	871020	All right, so last night, Erin McGathey, my girlfriend,
871020	876340	and live-in lover, she was just, I
876340	877780	don't know why she landed on this.
877780	880860	She landed on this TBS series, this reality show
880860	882460	called King of the Nerds.
882460	883500	It's a reality show.
884460	887060	It's straight up the middle, structurally.
887060	890060	It exactly follows the template of every reality show.
890060	893780	But finally, instead of like, who's the hottest?
893780	895460	What's up with titties?
895460	897020	Who wants to marry a midget?
897020	899700	Suck a nut.
899700	903180	Joe, Joe Middleroad.
903180	906340	It's like all variations on the people that you hang out
906340	907740	with at your 10-year reunion.
907740	910540	What if they got to write a show?
910540	911900	Well, there would be no writers.
911900	913420	And then we'd do that thing.
914220	919900	Ooh, the mall, the friendliest mall, eliminations.
919900	922020	It was interesting, because it's nerds.
922020	925140	They literally called it King of the Nerds.
925140	927700	They gathered what they claimed to be
927700	929980	the best of the nerds of the country.
929980	931500	And they eliminate one per episode.
931500	933220	Standard reality show.
933220	937580	Do they answer the question, what's up with titties?
937580	940220	I'm ignoring that.
941060	943980	A manic, a manic from the energy.
943980	945620	Yeah, you're fucking losing your cool.
945620	948260	This is what we wanted.
948260	950740	It's hosted, and it was executive produced.
950740	952780	So I think they probably took it out and pitched it,
952780	954580	which makes me feel a lot better about it.
954580	958220	Curtis Armstrong, AKA Booger from Revenge of the Nerds,
958220	961580	and Robert Carradine, AKA Lewis, was that his name?
961580	963380	Yeah, from right to the nerds.
963380	965460	Main nerd.
965460	967260	It's hosted and executive produced by them.
967260	968300	And then they gather these nerds,
968300	969660	and they have them in nerd competitions,
969660	971380	and they eliminate nerds.
971380	973700	But here's the interesting thing about it to me.
973700	976700	So I sit in bed last night with my girlfriend.
976700	985580	She surfs through the ether sphere, coined it.
985580	987300	She finds this show, King of the Nerds.
987300	989500	We watch, in the span of three and a half hours,
989500	992180	we watch the entire eight episode run of the first season.
992180	993220	We watch the entire thing.
993220	993900	We got nothing to do with it.
993900	995300	Sunday night, fuck it.
995300	997500	I sit there and play Minecraft while I'm watching it.
997500	999220	We watch the whole thing.
999220	1001300	And at the end of it, we're like, oh, I
1001300	1002780	hope that girl wins.
1002780	1004660	Oh, she didn't win.
1004660	1007100	Spoilers.
1007100	1009940	And then Aaron goes, oh, she's following you on Twitter.
1009940	1012860	I tweet her, hey, me and Aaron think you should have won.
1012860	1013580	Oh, thank you.
1013580	1015020	Hey, if you're ever in LA, buy you a drink.
1015020	1016380	Hey, I live in the valley.
1016380	1017380	Hey, you want to be on my show?
1017380	1020300	OK, yeah, see you tomorrow night.
1020300	1023220	In the span of 12 hours, this is either Rupert Murdoch's
1023220	1028300	greatest nightmare or his master plan.
1028300	1031660	I can't figure out which, but I know that reality has changed.
1031660	1034220	And I know that it has nothing to do with reality television,
1034220	1036460	but the television is being made differently, consumed
1036460	1038460	differently.
1038460	1039140	Interesting.
1039140	1041100	My agent didn't call her agent.
1041100	1042580	She's a fantasy author.
1042580	1044340	She was one of the nerds.
1044340	1046740	She made it all the way almost to the very end
1046740	1049860	and really, really had an incredible, interesting hero's
1049860	1052380	journey.
1052460	1053860	You can buy her books and stuff.
1053860	1056020	We'll let her plug them when she comes up here.
1056020	1059660	This is my introduction of her.
1059660	1061500	Roses are red.
1061500	1064020	Guests are blue.
1064020	1065940	Please welcome Genevieve Pearson.
1065940	1066440	Hello.
1077420	1077920	Hello.
1077920	1082140	Sorry, I had an energy drink, and then I had another one.
1082140	1083300	I noticed that.
1083300	1085380	That's like me on my seventh Diet Coke.
1085380	1085860	Yeah.
1085860	1089820	You just reach this tipping point where everything
1089820	1091860	goes by in a blur.
1091860	1100220	So and help yourself to vodka.
1100220	1102980	So all right, there's a million questions I want to ask you.
1102980	1105580	We'll probably have to get it down to like eight.
1105580	1106860	I want to talk about.
1106860	1109020	I don't see why we can't do a million.
1109020	1111740	That seems logically feasible to me.
1111820	1112540	What a nerd.
1115980	1117700	An infinite dimension.
1117700	1119400	To me, on the top of my life, I'm
1119400	1120400	sure there's people in the audience
1120400	1122380	who actually watched season one of this show
1122380	1124260	and actually would have a million questions about it.
1124260	1125240	What's up with Alana?
1125240	1126500	What's up with so-and-so?
1126500	1130700	And so but I think the most important thing to talk about,
1130700	1134100	because I've never really talked to someone intimately that
1134100	1137020	went through this whole sausage factory called reality
1137020	1140660	television, which for now, it's going on 20 years.
1140660	1141700	We've developed this thing.
1142660	1145500	But I feel like I have to give you a specific question about it.
1145500	1149140	I can't just go, hey, take us from the mouth
1149140	1153020	to the anus of this monster through eight episodes.
1153020	1154860	But OK, well, here's a specific question.
1154860	1159900	How long does it take from so you show up?
1159900	1162900	Is it like boot camp where you bring you luggage
1162900	1164300	and you show up?
1164300	1166260	Yeah, so what happened with me is I found out
1166260	1168420	I was in the top 16 and only 11 people
1168420	1169500	are going to go on the show.
1169500	1171660	But you have to show up for the final audition
1172100	1174580	with everything as though you are going on the show.
1174580	1178660	And so they spend a weekend in what we all call hotel jail.
1178660	1179820	You don't see anybody.
1179820	1181140	You don't interact with anyone.
1181140	1182940	If you go around, you have to wear a blindfold,
1182940	1185740	because they don't want you to run into another contestant.
1185740	1187500	You can't have any clue what's going on.
1187500	1190220	Wait, I don't understand the reasoning for that.
1190220	1192180	Because they don't want to spoil the surprise,
1192180	1194140	and they want everything to be genuine while you do
1194140	1194860	your final audition.
1194860	1196020	What's the surprise at that point?
1196020	1197900	When there's 16 people and five of them
1197900	1201460	aren't going to be on the show, what could they possibly spoil?
1202460	1205260	That Kurt Armstrong is walking around the hallway?
1205260	1206660	That's a good question.
1206660	1208700	Well, they just don't want you to know who else is
1208700	1210940	going to be on the show, period.
1210940	1212980	They want you coming in very blind.
1212980	1214820	They want the genuine emotion that you
1214820	1216300	have when you first meet somebody.
1216300	1219420	And if you already met them and had formed an opinion,
1219420	1221220	even if it was just passing in the hallway.
1221220	1223100	Yeah, so that's kind of what they're going for.
1223100	1225820	And so that's how we, so that was the first weekend.
1225820	1228660	And then from there, you don't have any contact
1228660	1230820	with anybody you know or love.
1230820	1233260	So your husband, who we just met before the show, Paul.
1233260	1234540	Yeah, Paul.
1234540	1237100	So at a certain point, he goes into shadow lock?
1237100	1237860	Like really?
1237860	1239500	Like you're sequestered like a jury.
1239500	1240940	Yeah, so he left me at the hotel,
1240940	1243340	and that's the last he heard from me until I was
1243340	1245140	done with the entire show.
1245140	1247140	Which is what span of time?
1247140	1248260	One full month.
1248260	1249260	Wow.
1249260	1250020	That's crazy.
1250020	1254420	So one month with no contact with the outside world at all.
1254420	1257940	No, you're not allowed to tweet, text, email.
1257940	1260340	No email, no nothing.
1261340	1263620	Yes, they confiscated all of our electronics.
1263620	1265340	That's like living in the 20th century.
1265340	1268980	They took my Kindle.
1268980	1270900	They took my Kindle, and I just about cried.
1270900	1271940	I thought, I can't.
1271940	1273100	They took your Kindle?
1273100	1275180	I can't contact anybody.
1275180	1276620	No, they thought maybe I could hack it.
1276620	1278540	You could hack it because you're a nerd, right?
1278540	1279540	Right.
1279540	1281260	That makes sense.
1281260	1284500	We're going to have to crack down on these N words.
1284500	1285220	Nerds, nerds.
1285220	1291300	Just because it starts with N, doesn't mean you can't say it.
1295140	1299780	I love N word Reagan, the first lady during the 80s.
1302780	1305700	OK, well, that's intriguing.
1305700	1310500	She's one of the nice ones, but by that I mean first ladies.
1310500	1313020	How did you not win the show?
1313020	1314780	I'm saying to her, how did you not win?
1315780	1316580	OK.
1316580	1318580	Because at the end of it, and I'm sorry,
1318580	1320180	this interview is going to involve spoilers.
1320180	1321140	You can't just go watch it.
1321140	1321660	I mean, she did.
1321660	1322500	Are you allowed to do that?
1322500	1324220	Can you talk about the show on a podcast?
1324220	1324980	It's already aired.
1324980	1325900	Oh, well then.
1325900	1328460	The reason is because they did it survivor style where
1328460	1330300	it gets down to the last two people,
1330300	1334180	and the final decision is based on popular vote
1334180	1336340	among the people that have all lost.
1336340	1339860	They all come back, and they all go, remember me, sucka?
1339860	1342060	And then they, you know, it's come on.
1342060	1347740	It's unfair because you went to three nerd offs, which
1347740	1354020	is like the dog pit where you send people that you hope
1354020	1356380	get eliminated to rip out the throats.
1356380	1358740	It's like the gladiator battle of the death.
1358740	1361140	And so three times she was sent there,
1361140	1363780	and three times you watch her have
1363780	1368260	to cope with areas outside her nerd expertise and kind of adapt.
1368260	1370060	And it's very, very lovable.
1370940	1375380	Like my favorite moment of the show of the first season
1375380	1380860	is after the debate where you did a fantastic job of debating.
1380860	1382980	They had a competition where they
1382980	1385100	had to debate about comic book characters.
1385100	1392820	And Genevieve shut down this guy that he accidentally
1392820	1395100	called Frank Miller John Miller or something like that.
1395100	1395940	You corrected him.
1395940	1397940	First of all, it's Frank Miller.
1397940	1400820	But your argument was more cogent.
1400820	1402620	It was more deserving of a win.
1402620	1404700	Kevin Smith, who was one of the celebrity judges,
1404700	1408020	goes like, first of all, you got to give props
1408020	1411100	to a chick who could shut a guy down called Frank Miller.
1411100	1415740	But at the same time, you know, I got to give it to him.
1415740	1418140	He edged you out.
1418140	1425500	Like at a distant point, Genevieve, her face is in a pillow.
1425500	1426500	Her head's not on camera.
1426660	1428020	All you can see here is her hair.
1428020	1429060	Afterwards, by the way.
1429060	1432740	And two fellow contestants sitting on her bed.
1432740	1435540	And you just see Genevieve's head buried in a pillow.
1435540	1440380	And it has to be subtitled because it's sob ease.
1440380	1445540	And the subtitles say, stupid Kevin Smith.
1448980	1450180	And then sob, sob.
1450180	1454860	And then, I thought he was supposed to be cool.
1454860	1458140	It's so great, so human.
1458140	1461300	And it's so much more merciful to him than he was to you.
1461300	1463180	Because, I mean, you can't follow up.
1463180	1465060	You've got to give props to a chick
1465060	1466740	with not giving her the point.
1466740	1468580	Because otherwise, that sucks us.
1468580	1471180	Because you just said you saw her as a chick.
1471180	1473060	She has to win.
1473060	1476860	If you say, good job, toots.
1476860	1478300	And then smack me on the ass.
1478300	1481580	You can't follow it up with, but I love guys.
1481660	1484820	Like, you can barely get away with it.
1484820	1485820	Good job, toots.
1485820	1486580	You got Moxie.
1486580	1488980	You're hired.
1488980	1490140	We've at least gotten there.
1490140	1492100	Was he still wearing that douchey hockey jersey
1492100	1492940	that he's always been wearing?
1492940	1493780	Yes, he was.
1493780	1494580	Yeah, so.
1494580	1497740	Hey, hey, hockey jersey.
1500860	1505900	That's Enigma, Return to Innocence.
1505900	1507700	That's been on your mind lately.
1507700	1508460	I love that song.
1509100	1512540	OK, so a month.
1512540	1516180	And how much do you get paid while you're working
1516180	1522620	for a month off the grid, while your husband may or may not
1522620	1524900	get 9-11ed?
1524900	1526620	And you wouldn't be allowed to know.
1526620	1527140	We wouldn't.
1527140	1528420	Because it's not on your Kindle.
1528420	1530580	And even if it was, you're not even allowed to see it there.
1530580	1532860	Yeah, we couldn't contact anyone.
1532860	1534300	OK, so I'm not.
1534300	1534940	I have an NDA.
1534940	1537180	I'll say that we got a per diem.
1537180	1542700	And it was a meal per diem of $25 for three meals a day.
1542700	1543860	So you could do them that.
1543860	1545460	And that was the total.
1545460	1547180	We didn't technically get paid.
1547180	1547700	OK.
1547700	1548820	Because it was a game show.
1548820	1550580	But we got a per diem.
1550580	1552780	Wait, you didn't get paid.
1552780	1555060	You're not allowed to say that?
1555060	1556260	Well, it was a game show.
1556260	1557260	So we're not being paid as actors.
1557260	1558980	Oh, of course paying would be unethical.
1558980	1560580	If they paid us as actors, if they
1560580	1562780	paid us as people who are performers,
1562780	1566060	then we would be admissible to SAG or another Guild.
1566140	1567620	But you knew when you signed up that you
1567620	1569660	were going to be on the show for a month
1569660	1573780	and possibly only get meals paid for that entire time.
1573780	1575380	Was I aware?
1575380	1577420	Honestly, I thought I was going to be like Survivor, where
1577420	1581420	the longer you lasted, the more prize money you got.
1581420	1583740	You didn't know that you could just be there for a full month,
1583740	1587900	go right to the wire, and then come home, and then zip.
1587900	1590740	I think they told us about two weeks beforehand
1590740	1592060	what it was going to be.
1592060	1594100	And at that point, it's like, oh, OK.
1594260	1596020	Guess what?
1596020	1598420	Loving husband.
1598420	1600540	Now I'm in the final 16.
1600540	1604140	Oh, let's take the dignity option, where we're just like,
1604140	1604940	yeah, of course.
1604940	1605500	You'd have to go through that.
1605500	1606340	What's the grand prize?
1606340	1607580	What did the winner take on?
1607580	1608820	100,000.
1608820	1609780	100,000 beans.
1609780	1611380	Which, I mean, I'm biased.
1611380	1612860	This is from my unique perspective.
1612860	1613540	But what?
1613540	1614300	That's a prize?
1618300	1619140	1%.
1619140	1622980	Return to innocence, indeed.
1623140	1626980	I mean, I guess, I guess, cheek patio furniture
1626980	1627900	is getting up there.
1630540	1632380	Yeah, $100,000 is a lot of money to pay.
1632380	1634660	We'll filigree that you want to put on your cupcakes.
1634660	1635940	That doesn't come cheap.
1635940	1637020	Oh, man.
1637020	1637940	My electric bill.
1640620	1642740	I should start a reality show where I just have people come
1642740	1646340	over and just like, I don't know,
1646340	1650660	bring flashlights and compete for the right to light my life.
1650660	1652500	And then I'd give the winner $100,000
1652500	1653580	after a year of doing that.
1653580	1658580	I'd make a profit on what I saved in light bulbs.
1658580	1661300	What are you, Caesar Augustus?
1661300	1662500	Not by choice, man.
1662500	1663220	Not by choice.
1663220	1666220	Yeah, no, it's become a choice.
1666220	1667220	What am I supposed to do?
1667220	1669780	You're choosing to make slaves out of people.
1669780	1670340	Well, oh, no.
1670340	1671060	I'm not really doing that.
1671060	1672420	But if you're paying them, then they're not
1672420	1672940	taking these things.
1672940	1675260	He's not going to pay these fuckers.
1675260	1676660	He said it's going to be a game show.
1676660	1677260	It's a prize.
1677260	1677900	I'm giving a prize.
1677900	1679180	I can't pay them, Genevieve.
1679180	1680180	They're on a game show.
1681180	1683380	And my hands are tied.
1683380	1684980	Actually, technically, so are theirs.
1684980	1689220	But that's just part of the rules.
1689220	1691820	What are you willing to do to be on TV?
1691820	1695420	I don't want to be guilty of the crime of letting you go
1695420	1699020	without, like, is there anybody in the audience who has a
1699020	1700700	question, not specifically about the show,
1700700	1703620	or just anybody, raise your hand if you're really burning
1703620	1707260	a question to ask Genevieve, whether it's about reality TV
1707260	1709100	in general or the show.
1709140	1710740	Someone's raising their hand back there.
1710740	1711980	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
1711980	1713900	It changed their minds at the last minute, as far as I've heard.
1713900	1719620	So everybody that watches reality shows
1719620	1721060	knows that there's two components to it.
1721060	1724500	Basically, there's this sort of pseudo coverage of everything
1724500	1725300	that's happening.
1725300	1728220	And then you're constantly cutting to these VH1 talking
1728220	1729820	heads against a green screen.
1729820	1734060	And they seem relevant, because if you guys were in costumes,
1734060	1736460	then you're in the same costume.
1736460	1737940	And that's probably not faked.
1737940	1742020	Because also, emotionally, very often, people
1742020	1744060	are crying in those talking heads.
1744060	1745420	So when do those happen?
1745420	1747620	And how do they get you into that slaughterhouse?
1747620	1749740	Well, so what happens is, first of all,
1749740	1751580	I don't know how other reality shows are.
1751580	1754860	I felt a lot of ours was honest to the spirit of the drama.
1754860	1757580	Honestly, they have to edit a lot out,
1757580	1758820	and everything gets changed.
1758820	1764100	But the spirit of what happened was pretty honest overall.
1764100	1767020	However, for the talking heads, that
1767020	1769100	was a sort of frustrating situation for me.
1769100	1770660	Because you might not have realized,
1770660	1773860	I'm a person who gets really focused on something.
1773860	1776180	I'll be working, and I'll be focused in on this.
1776180	1779900	And at some point, they realized that if we pull Genevieve out
1779900	1781740	when she's really focused on something,
1781740	1784140	we get really great off-cuff comments.
1784140	1787100	Because I'm so snappy, I want to get back to work.
1787100	1790460	So I start getting really snappish and kind of drowsy.
1790460	1791780	Can we do a thing?
1791780	1793460	Can you?
1793460	1795180	Let me be you.
1795180	1798100	And you be, like, is it like a producer with a clipboard
1798100	1799100	that pulls you aside?
1799100	1800100	Can we do a talking to Genevieve?
1800100	1800780	Yes, I can do this.
1800780	1801420	OK, all right.
1801420	1802500	So I'm Genevieve.
1802500	1803020	OK.
1803020	1804420	Now, do you want a moment in the show,
1804420	1806420	or do you want me to do, like, we're here?
1806420	1808140	Do you want to be a Genevieve?
1808140	1810620	You're catching me at a moment when I'm Genevieve,
1810620	1812300	and I'm writing a fantasy novel.
1812300	1814300	Dan and Aaron, you guys do a scene.
1814300	1816940	You're in the kitchen talking about stuff,
1816940	1820180	and then Genevieve will pull you out as a producer, Dan.
1820180	1821300	OK.
1821300	1822860	And when it happens, they pull you right out?
1822860	1824660	No, well, yes, for the most part.
1824660	1826660	Something happens, like, let's say you have drama
1826660	1828180	and you have a fight with somebody.
1828180	1830220	After that fight, the second it's resolved,
1830220	1831740	there's somebody there going, come on,
1831740	1833020	we're going to go talk about this right now.
1833020	1835740	All right, so we'll start from, I'm doing dishes.
1835740	1836660	I'm washing a dish.
1836660	1838900	Well, are we going to do a real scene?
1838900	1839900	I'm Genevieve.
1839900	1842180	Oh, yeah, I thought we were doing us.
1842180	1844260	Dan and Aaron, just for the sake of this experiment,
1844260	1847540	just try to manufacture a conflict between the two of you.
1847540	1850300	Just manufacture a conflict, yes.
1850300	1851740	Just strictly for entertainment purposes.
1851740	1852460	She broke a dish.
1852460	1852980	Go.
1852980	1853580	Oh, I broke a dish.
1853580	1854300	OK, that's good.
1854300	1854860	OK.
1854860	1856340	And it's a dishwashing competition.
1856340	1857620	Is this dishbroken?
1857620	1860700	This is my special Batman dish that I brought.
1860700	1862260	I'm sorry.
1862260	1864100	I just, I'm sorry.
1864100	1867180	Well, were you going to wait for me to find out
1867180	1868300	that it was broken?
1868300	1869260	When did you know it was broken?
1869260	1869660	I don't know.
1869660	1871500	I just didn't want you to get upset with me.
1872300	1872800	OK.
1872800	1873300	CG dick.
1876740	1880140	Well, Patrick, I only brought one dish.
1880140	1882060	We're being Dan and Aaron.
1882060	1882700	What?
1882700	1885340	Well, Jeff is getting a certain direction.
1885340	1887700	He just labeled you Patrick, though.
1887700	1888500	He just labeled you.
1888500	1889900	OK, fine, fine.
1889900	1890620	I'm Aaron.
1890620	1891900	I'm your girlfriend.
1891900	1894780	Jeff just hears what happened, Dan.
1894780	1895940	So now we can talk about this.
1895940	1897900	What the fuck is going on?
1897900	1898940	Jeff wanted us to.
1898940	1900940	Genevieve, just pull them out of their real lives
1901020	1902860	to give them a fucking.
1902860	1905780	OK, this is me giving him the hand signal.
1905780	1907140	Oh, OK, all right.
1907140	1909100	And now you never talk again.
1909100	1910100	OK.
1910100	1911100	Hey.
1911100	1911600	Wow.
1911600	1912100	Hey, Dan.
1917300	1918100	Hey, Dan.
1918100	1919900	How are you feeling, man?
1919900	1923500	I'm frustrated just because of the broken dish thing.
1923500	1926460	Also, I didn't understand what the fuck anyone was doing.
1926460	1927100	OK.
1927100	1930020	Well, will you tell me what happened, your own words?
1930100	1932660	Well, I had agreed at the forefront
1932660	1934340	that we were going to do a reenactment.
1934340	1934940	Wait, wait, let me stop you there.
1934940	1936860	Can you say it in the present tense, please?
1936860	1939260	Oh, right, right, right, right.
1939260	1942140	I'm agreeing to do a thing that's
1942140	1943860	like a reenactment of a reality show.
1943860	1945420	I want to play Genevieve.
1945420	1948340	And then other people are piping up with their comedy.
1948340	1949860	And it's just a little frustrating
1949860	1951140	because no one's listening.
1951140	1952620	There's not a lot of listening going on.
1952620	1957140	And I'm supposedly on stage with professional improvisers.
1957140	1959820	OK, so you're telling me nobody's listening.
1959820	1962380	Can you say that in a more concise way?
1962380	1963420	Nobody's listening.
1963420	1964220	Nobody's listening.
1964220	1965380	Nobody's listening.
1965380	1965900	I don't know.
1965900	1966700	Nobody's listening.
1966700	1969540	Hello, hello, nobody's listening.
1969540	1971060	OK, OK, that's great.
1971060	1975940	Now, can I take you back to this morning when you and Erin,
1975940	1977940	I'm going to remind you that you and Erin
1977940	1979740	were having breakfast.
1979740	1981700	And she took your eggs.
1981700	1985300	I saw her reach over and grab something off of your plate.
1985300	1986740	Now, how did you feel that?
1986740	1987780	You saw that?
1987780	1989140	I mean, I thought it was weird.
1989340	1990540	I didn't mind at the time.
1990540	1991060	I didn't mind.
1991060	1993580	Can you say the question while you're answering?
1993580	2000980	When Erin took my eggs, I didn't think it was a big deal.
2000980	2003100	So that didn't bother you?
2003100	2008380	Well, I mean, I guess it could have bothered me.
2008380	2010900	When Erin took my eggs, it seemed
2010900	2013060	like it could have bothered me.
2013060	2016500	OK, so you don't think maybe it was indicative of the fact
2016500	2018540	that she doesn't respect you as a partner?
2021420	2022780	Sure, I guess so.
2022780	2023580	Oh, sorry, sorry.
2023580	2024060	Yeah.
2024060	2024620	OK, all right.
2024620	2025380	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
2025380	2028180	Yeah, just restate the whole thing.
2028180	2030580	When Erin took my eggs, I felt like it
2030580	2035540	was indicative of her not respecting me as a partner.
2035540	2036540	We'll be right back.
2039460	2040700	Very nice.
2040700	2042620	Wow.
2042620	2045180	All right, well, Genevieve, you're a fantasy author.
2045180	2047900	I want to be able to plug your stuff, because I have a series
2047900	2050340	of books called the Song of the Silvertongues series
2050340	2052300	on Amazon, Genevieve Pearson.
2052300	2057780	And right now, I have a Kickstarter for HobbyCon 2014
2057780	2059060	in Pasadena, California.
2059060	2062020	So if you have a hobby or craft, you want to show off.
2062020	2062980	HobbyCon.
2062980	2064580	It's like an all-inclusive hobby.
2064580	2067980	It's like a grassroots pre-GenCon.
2067980	2069700	Yeah, it's awesome.
2069700	2072740	For anybody who's a nerd or a doer, if you like to knit
2072740	2077060	or paint war hand with 40K, anybody who likes to do stuff,
2077060	2078340	this is like your Olympics.
2078340	2079540	All right.
2079540	2080620	All right, HobbyCon.
2080620	2084220	And look for Genevieve Pearson.
2084220	2085380	Google the name.
2085380	2087660	She's got two books she's very proud of and one
2087660	2089140	that she's fine with.
2089140	2090900	Yeah.
2090900	2092340	She should win it, so it's OK.
2092340	2092820	Thank you.
2092820	2093340	She should win it.
2093340	2093860	Thank you, Genevieve.
2093860	2094660	Thanks for coming down.
2094660	2096100	Thank you so much for having us.
2096100	2112100	All right, let's work it out now on stage.
2112100	2114260	I don't want to.
2114260	2116180	It's not a big deal.
2116180	2119820	Jeff suggested that we played ourselves and simulated a fight.
2119820	2120620	I didn't hear that.
2120620	2121340	I didn't say that.
2121340	2122100	I said that.
2122100	2125340	I was saying, I used you guys' names to set up the thing, but like.
2125380	2125980	Oh, I see.
2125980	2127620	I thought, well, then I misunderstood.
2127620	2128100	I'm sorry.
2128100	2128980	A lot of mixed signals.
2128980	2130300	Look, I'm not here to make friends.
2133060	2134780	Can you say, I'm here to win.
2142180	2144580	That's another theme in reality shows is every single person
2144580	2147100	alternating, but when they're when they're on top of the game,
2147100	2148580	they're like, it's not business.
2148580	2149220	It's personal.
2149220	2151100	Or I'm sorry, I think they were about.
2151100	2152420	That's what I would do.
2152420	2154260	I'd be like, I don't care about winning.
2154260	2157340	Who said they didn't like me?
2157340	2159780	So Jenny, when you were up here right now pretending to be
2159780	2161860	a producer and you got in the middle of that conflict,
2161860	2164700	how did you feel about that?
2164700	2168340	I'm feeling a lot of stress right now because I don't like
2168340	2170140	having to mediate between a couple.
2170140	2171700	OK, can you make that more succinct?
2171700	2172700	Say it.
2172700	2173180	Say it.
2173180	2174580	Include the question into it.
2174580	2177140	I'm feeling a lot of stress having to mediate between Dan
2177140	2180820	and Erin right now because I'm in a healthy relationship
2180820	2181860	and I just feel really bad.
2184740	2189500	Can you say it again, be a little more succinct and also
2189500	2190820	add something racist into it?
2193740	2197580	Well, I can tell that Erin has a fiery Irish temper
2197580	2200700	and that's why she is having such a hard time.
2200700	2202860	We'll be right back.
2202860	2205020	Genevieve Pearson.
2205020	2208180	Wow, we got to the bottom of the.
2208180	2210020	That's what I was hoping we could talk about
2210020	2212980	is the reality show source code.
2212980	2215420	Yeah, it's making an open source project.
2215420	2217460	You at home can make your own reality show now
2217460	2219260	with that source code.
2219260	2221460	All right, let's bring to the stage Kumail Nanjiani.
2224460	2234140	Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2234140	2236300	That is the most rock and roll face anyone's
2236300	2238300	ever made to this song.
2238300	2239780	Kumail Nanjiani.
2243980	2245780	I love that song.
2245780	2250220	I'm going to call out your name next time I'm making love.
2250220	2251500	Is it to me?
2251500	2254300	No, it's just because I like the sound.
2254300	2258380	Kumail Nanjiani.
2258380	2260980	That's actually what I do.
2260980	2263980	I say, you've been Nanjiani'd.
2263980	2266020	You know what's weird is, you know who else does that?
2266020	2266900	Ben Stein.
2266900	2271180	And it's not Ben Stein.
2271180	2275020	Also, we heard I yell out Kumail while we're at your lab.
2275020	2276500	Kumail Nanjiani.
2279820	2282980	Enigma, 1995.
2282980	2284660	Do you know all that reality talk is interesting?
2284660	2285940	Because I just watched it.
2285940	2289380	I'd never seen it the first season of Real World
2289380	2290380	that we're re-airing it.
2290380	2290900	Oh, really?
2290900	2291780	And I just watched it.
2291780	2293940	And it's sort of the first reality show.
2293940	2296460	And it's so interesting to watch a reality show where
2296460	2300220	the people don't have like reality show personalities yet.
2300220	2302260	Where they weren't raised on reality.
2302260	2304140	Yeah, and they're just sort of being themselves.
2304140	2305420	And it was a very positive thing.
2305420	2308220	You watched them discover the flint rock of eliminating
2308220	2309140	the black guy.
2309140	2311020	Exactly.
2311020	2316980	You watched them go like, oh, Kwon is very antagonistic.
2316980	2318660	Do you notice that, too?
2318660	2321860	And then afterwards, you watched them institutionally.
2321860	2324460	What if you did a show where they had to eliminate the black
2324460	2324940	guy?
2324940	2327300	It's totally amazing, because it's exactly that.
2327300	2329300	It's stuff that happened sort of organically
2329380	2330260	with the still cameras.
2330260	2332860	But then later, they're like, all right, we got to do this.
2332860	2335620	At the end of the season, they just
2335620	2338220	decided to grab all the cameras and start interviewing
2338220	2339060	the interviewers.
2339060	2341420	And it's a very real organic moment.
2341420	2343620	But I bet at some point, they were like, all right.
2343620	2345980	OK, what you guys do now is you have
2345980	2348980	to pretend that we don't know when you come and steal
2348980	2350100	the cameras from us.
2350100	2352620	I'm like the forest gump of reality TV,
2352620	2357220	because in the 90s, I remember being in Milwaukee
2357220	2359260	in the 90s when they were starting to talk about how
2359260	2364020	they're making the show for MTV, which was still a channel
2364020	2365300	where they showed music videos.
2365300	2366740	It was like they had some butt head
2366740	2369460	and they had some other stuff, but it was still largely like,
2369460	2370460	we were all making jokes.
2370460	2372180	Like, huh, I'm going to put some music videos on it.
2372180	2374320	But the joke was because they were still
2374320	2376220	supposed to make music television.
2376220	2378060	And they were working on this thing,
2378060	2379460	and it was called The Real World.
2379460	2381540	And the whole idea was that these kids were living
2381540	2383780	in this house, and there was going to be cameras everywhere.
2383780	2384700	And it was ironic.
2384700	2385620	It was ironic.
2385820	2387980	Everyone that heard about the idea was like, what?
2387980	2389500	What does that mean?
2389500	2391660	If there's cameras everywhere, then they're not going to go,
2391660	2393020	no, what they're doing is they're
2393020	2394700	going to have the cameras everywhere,
2394700	2397420	and they're not even going to have filming them right away.
2397420	2398420	And they're just going to get used to it.
2398420	2399460	They're going to get so used to it.
2399460	2400460	And it was like this whole thing.
2400460	2402260	It was introduced like this kubrickian experiment.
2402260	2404660	Such a crazy thing that it was crazy back then.
2404660	2405660	And now we're like, yeah.
2405660	2406860	It was crazy.
2406860	2409180	And so then there was a point.
2409180	2411820	So flash forward to me in Los Angeles, Thanksgiving.
2411820	2412900	I just moved.
2412900	2414300	Schrab was there.
2414300	2415100	I was there.
2415180	2417420	I'm sitting at Thanksgiving because we had no family in LA.
2417420	2419460	I'm sitting at my agent's house for Thanksgiving.
2419460	2422060	I'm sitting next to this weird little Australian guy.
2422060	2423700	And I go, so what are you working on?
2423700	2427580	And he goes, oh, I'm working on a reality show.
2427580	2428900	It's been big in Europe.
2428900	2431260	Might Shrimp of the Barbie, whatever.
2431260	2432500	I think it was Australia or something.
2432500	2433740	I don't know, whatever.
2433740	2435340	It sounds like it might have been deaf.
2438540	2444300	I'm almost reasonably certain, piecing together the evidence.
2444300	2448100	I choose to believe it was Mark Burnett that I was talking to.
2448100	2448900	Is he Australian?
2448900	2449620	I don't know.
2449620	2453220	But it was like the easiest thing to find out.
2453220	2455780	I don't want to because I don't want to know.
2455780	2456260	He is.
2456260	2456780	OK.
2456780	2460380	So sometimes people go, I think you were sitting next to Mark
2460380	2462140	Burnett because I was at my agent's house.
2462140	2462740	That's amazing.
2462740	2464140	She was a hot shot.
2464140	2466300	And I was sitting next to this guy with this accent.
2466300	2468500	And he was telling me about the show, his reality show.
2468500	2471340	And he goes like, yeah, it's huge in Europe.
2471340	2472740	They put everybody on an island.
2473460	2476420	This was the elimination thing, was becoming a thing.
2476420	2477900	And I was like, what the fuck?
2477900	2478700	That sounds insane.
2478700	2481180	But how would that work?
2481180	2485820	And he goes, no, but they eliminate the strong people first.
2485820	2488260	And then the middle of the road people kind of take over.
2488260	2490660	But more than that, they're also eating each other alive.
2490660	2492160	And they're having sex with each other.
2492160	2493860	And I was like, that's going to be a hit.
2493860	2494460	I said it.
2494460	2495540	I said it.
2495540	2496220	Give me my money.
2496220	2497180	You said that's going to be a hit?
2497180	2497580	Yeah.
2497580	2498540	I was from Forrest Gump.
2498540	2499860	You totally are, though.
2499860	2500900	Wait, wait.
2500900	2501500	Turn it off.
2503740	2507540	Then I'm sitting in my apartment.
2507540	2509260	My girlfriend at the time calls me.
2509260	2510540	She was a studio executive.
2510540	2511180	She calls me.
2511180	2513380	And she would used to call me after a day of work.
2513380	2514580	She would call me from the office,
2514580	2515700	because people would pitch her shows.
2515700	2518900	And she would go, oh, y vey.
2518900	2520580	I got to talk to my writer boyfriend.
2520580	2524500	I got to get some release from this insane industry.
2524500	2526980	On the heels of Survivor, the world is exploding.
2526980	2528700	Everything's changing.
2528700	2531220	I remember talking to her from my one-bedroom apartment.
2531220	2533500	That was your tipping point for the world changing
2533500	2535260	was Survivor?
2535260	2537540	I thought he was going to say 9-11.
2537540	2538540	I mean, I guess that's a-
2538540	2539740	Did 9-11 haven't happened yet.
2539740	2540380	Oh, right.
2540380	2541140	It's before 9-11.
2541140	2541500	It's not.
2541500	2542500	It's Survivor time.
2542500	2544220	You realize Al-Qaeda did what they
2544220	2547140	did because of reality TV.
2547140	2547980	I guess that's-
2547980	2550860	Do you know that they said, oh, I know how we-
2550860	2552700	obviously, we can look at it.
2552700	2555180	I hope this story ends with you meeting an 8-year-old Kim
2555180	2558500	Kardashian.
2558500	2560580	Where she's like, oh, I'm never going to be anything.
2560580	2563940	You can be whatever you want to be.
2563940	2566260	And then you gave her the confidence to be horrible.
2566260	2568500	My girlfriend called me up.
2568500	2570020	My girlfriend called me up, and she said-
2570020	2571900	she would call me up every once in a while, and she'd go,
2571900	2573660	I just heard a pitch for this show.
2573660	2574620	Buckle up.
2574620	2575940	You ready for this?
2575940	2578900	These people, they're on an alien planet.
2578900	2583340	And one of the guys is in a wheelchair,
2583340	2584820	and the gravity is weird.
2584820	2586700	So every once in a while, he can walk.
2586700	2587900	And I'd go, ha, ha, ha.
2587900	2589700	Later, lost, would have a character like that.
2590700	2595180	But she calls me up, and she goes like, so listen to this.
2595180	2598660	So this is a pitch I just heard for a reality show.
2598660	2608100	A man who's rich, he doesn't have a wife, but he's rich.
2608100	2612860	So all the women compete to be his wife,
2612860	2614660	because he needs a wife so bad.
2614660	2618580	And I'm like 20-whatever-year-old Dan Harmon going,
2619580	2621580	I'm saying in response to hearing this concept,
2621580	2623900	I'm going, fuck you.
2623900	2625420	No fucking way.
2625420	2627620	Society can't go there.
2627620	2628420	It's impossible.
2628420	2629460	Marriage?
2629460	2632580	The institution of marriage?
2632580	2635020	This is before who wants to fuck a midget.
2635020	2636820	Literally, primarily.
2636820	2638940	Everything just exploded like a mushroom cloud
2638940	2641060	to the point where one day, you were
2641060	2643980	allowed to be frazzled by any of it,
2643980	2646860	and then the next day, everyone had beaten you to the punch.
2646860	2648700	It's pretty impressive, because I just
2648700	2650980	read a thing today that said how marriage, people
2650980	2654500	are getting married less and less, and almost 50% of kids,
2654500	2656580	something's happening.
2656580	2657580	Nothing.
2657580	2658140	It's fine.
2658140	2659740	I tipped my cup.
2659740	2660740	It's probably not fine.
2660740	2661740	It's not being clumsy.
2661740	2664980	It said 50% of kids born are born out of wedlock.
2664980	2667420	And I think part of the reason people aren't getting married,
2667420	2668980	the sanctity of marriage, whatever that means.
2668980	2670780	Because they want to be romantic.
2670780	2673700	But I think because of things like Bachelor and stuff,
2673700	2678460	because it has cheapened that thing so much, it really.
2678460	2680420	It makes it feel like you're kind of a sucker.
2680420	2683060	We're moving into a weird Logan's run universe
2683060	2685700	where we have three life cycles or something,
2685700	2687300	where you go like, oh, who's your first wife?
2687300	2688180	Who's your second wife?
2688180	2688940	Who's your third wife?
2688940	2691020	Yeah, when I got married, I got married pretty young.
2691020	2695180	And I told my friends, and they literally were like, why?
2695180	2696660	That was literally their reaction.
2696660	2698580	And I said, how old were you when you got married?
2698580	2699580	I got married.
2699580	2701900	Well, it's sort of, I got married.
2701900	2703780	I know you guys have several weddings.
2703780	2705100	Yeah, we've had several.
2705100	2706540	We've had several weddings.
2706540	2707900	Oh, because you're from Pakistan?
2707900	2709100	Is that a thing?
2709100	2710100	Because they love weddings.
2710100	2711940	OK.
2711940	2714580	Somehow, even though it's racist, you are accurate.
2714580	2715080	Hi.
2721580	2724260	Well, because you're, I'm assuming your gods have
2724260	2726460	eight heads, so you have to go.
2726460	2729780	Eight weddings, one for each head.
2729780	2734260	I, Kumar of the North Plains, am sanctifying this marriage.
2734260	2736980	OK, now we have to go to the Western territory.
2736980	2743420	I, Asop, I lower my sword.
2743420	2745300	One wedding for each stereotype, so we
2745300	2748380	have to do one for the cab driving god,
2748380	2750980	and one for the side of the god.
2750980	2756140	I, Shalub of the cab, I declare this wedding.
2756140	2757580	Good reference.
2757580	2759180	Holy shit, quick change.
2759860	2762460	Shalub of the checker gods.
2762460	2763900	Oh, yeah.
2763900	2772580	I, of the Big Bang Theory, the dirty, Basinga, the Fisher
2772580	2774980	Stevens god.
2774980	2778540	This short circuit is complete.
2778540	2780180	By the circuits of Johnny Five.
2782940	2785740	Oh, my god.
2785740	2786580	No, this is why.
2786580	2790860	Because we first got married in secret,
2790860	2793620	like just me and her and a couple of our friends
2793620	2797660	at a, like, you know, where you go to just stand in line.
2797660	2799020	You literally stand in line.
2799020	2800060	At City Hall or something?
2800060	2801100	At City Hall.
2801100	2802940	And you get married, and it was like actually
2802940	2804500	a really beautiful, wonderful experience,
2804500	2805700	because all these people in line,
2805700	2807580	and some of them are pregnant, some of them are super old.
2807580	2808460	Oh, they're all kind of like.
2808460	2810140	They're all kind of had these things,
2810140	2811220	like everybody cleared their history,
2811220	2813860	but it was like very, and the guy who married us,
2813860	2816260	the magistrate guy, I don't know what you call him,
2816260	2818580	it was probably like the 30th wedding he'd done,
2818580	2821220	but he was so, like, warm.
2821220	2823860	And he seemed genuinely happy and joyous,
2823860	2825460	and it was such a wonderful.
2825460	2827940	And then after that, we went home and watched four weddings
2827940	2831420	at a funeral, you know, like it was a good day, you know?
2831420	2833700	I'm sorry, I couldn't get over the insensitivity.
2833700	2835660	You don't know if he's called the magistrate.
2835660	2839020	Like, can't you be a little more politically correct?
2839020	2840580	Like, judge.
2840580	2844420	No, I thought that would be funny after the eight headed god.
2844420	2848020	So we did that, and then we had a Muslim wedding,
2848020	2849940	and then we had how many?
2849940	2852660	And then we've had three weddings.
2852660	2855820	And then the third one actually was not even.
2855820	2858860	But then you have to have a funeral.
2858860	2861140	Well, that'll come.
2861140	2864260	Thanks for the reality check, bro.
2864260	2865340	I'm jealous.
2865340	2866220	I love weddings.
2866220	2867060	Maybe I should be.
2867060	2868780	Well, what's interesting was.
2868780	2870660	So many weddings.
2870660	2872300	I'm going to convert to Muslim.
2872300	2872980	To Muslim.
2872980	2873860	Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
2873860	2875780	To Islam, I'm a little drunk.
2875780	2876260	I don't know.
2876260	2879340	That's kind of a sinking ship right now.
2879340	2880460	Not many people.
2880460	2882860	Once Mike Tyson got on there, we were like, all right,
2882860	2883380	we're out.
2883380	2885900	What was your third wedding?
2885900	2887060	The third wedding, actually.
2887060	2889220	So we were married, but we hadn't told anybody.
2889220	2892180	And then one weekend, we just moved in New York.
2892180	2893700	We just told our friends, like, hey,
2893700	2895620	we're going to go get married this weekend.
2895620	2898260	And what we did was we stayed at home,
2898260	2899700	and we turned off our phones.
2899700	2901220	Let's get Emily out here.
2901220	2901720	Emily.
2901720	2902220	Yeah.
2903220	2905180	Emily Gordon, everybody.
2905180	2905680	Hi.
2905680	2906180	Hi.
2906180	2906680	Hi.
2906680	2907180	Hi.
2907180	2907680	Hi.
2912680	2914300	First off, we've never told anybody
2914300	2917260	that we were married in secret.
2917260	2919900	It could not matter less now.
2919900	2922660	We've been married a long time, and you know,
2922660	2923780	no secrets anymore.
2923780	2924820	No secrets, you guys.
2924820	2927060	We were married for like a year and a half before.
2927060	2928340	Before we told anybody.
2928340	2930380	Yeah.
2930740	2932060	I highly recommend it because you
2932060	2934540	don't get people being like, oh, you guys are newlyweds.
2934540	2935420	Isn't that weird?
2935420	2938460	Well, people still do that, and you're like, fuck you.
2938460	2941020	You don't know how dumb that is.
2941020	2943220	Which honestly, for us, we've been living together
2943220	2946220	for so long that getting married wasn't really a big difference.
2946220	2947900	That's, yeah, that's the real truth,
2947900	2949540	is that once you live with someone.
2949540	2953220	I got married, how old is that, 28, 29, somewhere around there?
2953220	2953720	Yeah.
2953720	2954140	Yeah.
2954140	2956060	I think that should be the new definition of marriage.
2956060	2957820	Grant, this is very LA of me to say,
2957820	2959900	because we live out here in this culture where
2960420	2962140	people come out here to pursue their dreams.
2962140	2963820	Your dreams don't come true.
2963820	2966260	So people get married out here when they're 40,
2966260	2967580	and they have kids when they're 50.
2967580	2968460	But I-
2968460	2969540	That's exactly right.
2969540	2974260	As such, I married Shrob and Kate.
2974260	2978820	And they had been together for so long
2978820	2981060	and living together for so long before it
2981060	2983740	that your first question is, what's
2983740	2984940	the point of getting married?
2984940	2986500	And then your second question is,
2986500	2989340	what could be more romantic than the decision
2989340	2992300	to get married by two people who don't have anything to gain
2992300	2994060	or lose by getting married?
2994060	2997540	And I think that we have to move forward into a society.
2997540	3000900	We have to.
3000900	3002220	High stakes game.
3002220	3005380	We also probably have to stop making lasers
3005380	3008820	that destroy the Earth, but we'll get around to this.
3008820	3010940	Look it up.
3010940	3014820	We have to move into a world where marriage is no longer
3014820	3017260	looked at as moving across a threshold,
3017260	3019260	like a thing that has to be done where you're like,
3019260	3021540	I wonder what it's going to be like after that.
3021540	3024140	Because the answer is, it's going to be the same.
3024140	3029060	So if more of this for 30 years isn't your cup of tea,
3029060	3030260	don't marry this person.
3030260	3033180	Yeah, I mean, for us, for me, it was a very romantic thing
3033180	3035540	because it's literally just saying to the war,
3035540	3037660	like, I'm going to be with this person forever.
3037660	3039460	And it was a very romantic.
3039460	3042780	And even though we've been married three times,
3042780	3045100	I never actually got to propose to you.
3045100	3047140	So I never got to.
3047140	3048260	Are you planning something?
3048260	3049060	What are you planning?
3050060	3059060	Well, hi, hi, hi, hi, Emily, will you marry me?
3059060	3060060	I will.
3060060	3061060	Yay!
3063060	3064060	Faith.
3064060	3065060	We did it.
3065060	3067060	Forgiveness.
3067060	3068060	It took us 50 episodes.
3068060	3070060	Destiny.
3070060	3072060	Piveness.
3072060	3073060	Emily Gordon, everybody.
3073060	3074060	Destiny.
3076060	3077060	Devotion.
3079060	3082060	Fourth wedding.
3082060	3083060	Fourth wedding.
3083060	3084060	Fourth wedding.
3084060	3087340	Yeah, the right way to put it, I thought,
3087340	3090260	was when I asked Strab, why is he marrying Kate,
3090260	3096740	he said, to paraphrase him, it's like, eh, I ran out
3096740	3100940	of ways to make it clear how much I love this person.
3100940	3103540	Which is, I think that's the right way to go.
3103540	3108380	Don't marry him until it's absolutely the only thing left.
3109060	3115060	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3120060	3123060	Forgiveness.
3123060	3126060	Vacuum.
3126060	3128060	Poopies.
3128060	3132060	All right, let's, come on, we got the time flies.
3132060	3133060	Let's keep this train going.
3133060	3135060	Let's bring Spencer up to the stage.
3135060	3136060	Spencer.
3137060	3142060	You don't usually see a proposal after the wedding,
3142060	3146060	but you never see a proposal after three weddings.
3146060	3147060	Yeah.
3147060	3149060	Spencer Crichton, everybody.
3149060	3151060	Welcome to the stage.
3154060	3157060	Hey, hey, hey.
3158060	3159060	Shit.
3160060	3162060	What?
3166060	3169060	Spencer, what's new in your life since we saw you last?
3169060	3173060	Um, I told you guys, I've been listening to that song,
3173060	3175060	Steppin' Out by Joe Jackson.
3177060	3180060	And I was unable to download it in time for Showtime tonight.
3180060	3182060	Yeah, but I really appreciate the thought.
3182060	3183060	How does that one go?
3183060	3185060	Can you sing a bit for us?
3185060	3194060	It goes, ba-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da,
3194060	3197060	da-da-da-da-da, bring.
3198060	3199060	Are there words?
3199060	3200060	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3200060	3201060	How do the words go?
3201060	3209060	Now, the mist across the window blocks the light,
3209060	3216060	but nothing hides the color of the lights that shine.
3216060	3218060	That's, I can't remember.
3218060	3220060	If that shit is, if that shit,
3221060	3224060	if what you just did is not on Tumblr in the next hour,
3224060	3226060	I'm going to be very disappointed.
3226060	3230060	I want full animated, fully recreated music video.
3230060	3234060	I want to hear a mashup between Enigma's Return to Innocence
3234060	3237060	and Joe Jackson's Steppin' Out.
3237060	3239060	Steppin' Back to Innocence.
3241060	3244060	Do you guys remember that we listened to that
3244060	3248060	and other Enigma songs on the way to medieval times?
3249060	3251060	On repeat, yeah.
3251060	3252060	It's down, I'm sorry.
3252060	3254060	What is the deal with Enigma?
3254060	3256060	Like, is it one guy? Is it a hundred?
3256060	3257060	It could be anything.
3257060	3258060	It's at least two guys.
3258060	3261060	One guy, one cave, forty mics.
3261060	3264060	It sounds like it could be, are they white?
3264060	3267060	You could put Enigma and Enya in a lineup
3267060	3269060	and I wouldn't know what was going on.
3269060	3272060	Also, they had that song that's ubiquitous,
3272060	3274060	like whenever anybody, like,
3274060	3276060	boop, boop, boop, boop.
3276060	3278060	Sadness.
3278060	3280060	I tried to do an impression of it.
3280060	3282060	Sadness part one.
3282060	3283060	Sadness part one.
3283060	3285060	Which is the cockiest name to a song ever.
3285060	3287060	There will be more.
3287060	3290060	Any time anyone was doing anything
3290060	3295060	involving gauze, candles, duvetyne and S&M,
3295060	3297060	like in any HBO show.
3297060	3300060	It's like Krista Berg's song of the Aladian Red,
3300060	3302060	The Beginning.
3303060	3305060	Whenever I hear Enigma, I picture those moles
3305060	3307060	who have never seen light.
3307060	3309060	Yeah, just like walking out.
3309060	3310060	They have no idea.
3310060	3312060	They're blind moles.
3312060	3315060	I picture a kid eating mango for the first time.
3315060	3317060	Oh.
3317060	3318060	What a movie.
3318060	3320060	Beautiful.
3320060	3323060	I picture my mom's pussy, but in a good way.
3323060	3326060	Full disclosure, like, I picture that also,
3326060	3328060	like, when I hear a variety of songs.
3329060	3332060	Especially, like, the Rocky theme.
3334060	3336060	His mom's pussy's a staircase.
3337060	3340060	It's specifically, yeah, it's a marble staircase.
3341060	3342060	In Philadelphia.
3342060	3344060	Spencer.
3344060	3345060	Hey, guys.
3345060	3347060	All right, well, let's get these.
3347060	3348060	Well, you were going to say something.
3348060	3351060	I was just going to say, I actually, this is terrible
3351060	3353060	and I am terrible.
3353060	3356060	You picture my mom's pussy and blah, blah, blah, yeah.
3356060	3357060	Yeah, yeah, no.
3357060	3359060	Did you actually know what your mom's pussy looks like?
3359060	3361060	A marble staircase, right?
3361060	3362060	If anybody should.
3362060	3363060	Right?
3363060	3364060	Yeah, yeah.
3364060	3365060	Yeah.
3365060	3366060	That's what he said, I thought.
3366060	3367060	That is what he said.
3367060	3368060	Okay.
3368060	3370060	Listening skills.
3370060	3371060	See, I'm listening to you, Dan.
3371060	3372060	Thanks.
3372060	3373060	Yeah.
3373060	3375060	I was just, I didn't write an intro sequence.
3375060	3377060	So, I mean, I wrote, but I didn't write an intro.
3377060	3378060	You're going to have to write an intro.
3378060	3379060	Yeah, I can try.
3379060	3384060	I distinctly remember you holding a dragon's dick open
3384060	3386060	so that arrows can be shire.
3386060	3389060	Oh, but after that, I've already chopped the dick off
3389060	3392060	and I kind of called dibs on it and it's in my bag.
3392060	3393060	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
3393060	3395060	Yeah, definitely.
3395060	3397060	I remember that.
3397060	3399060	Why don't you just freestyle one?
3399060	3401060	For better or for worse, just try.
3401060	3402060	No right or wrong answers.
3402060	3405060	Do you want to get the character she's passed out as we do this?
3405060	3406060	I mean, yeah.
3406060	3409060	Were you just listening to that song in lieu of...
3409060	3412060	I know this is unorthodox, but can I have Genevieve
3412060	3415060	be my advisor on this?
3415060	3418060	Similar to a nerd war?
3418060	3419060	Yeah.
3419060	3420060	Or nerd off.
3420060	3422060	Nerd off.
3422060	3423060	Nerd off.
3423060	3425060	If you guys haven't seen King and the Nerds,
3425060	3428060	check it out.
3428060	3434060	So, I am a lady with arrows.
3434060	3438060	Can I bring Celeste up to help me out right now, please?
3438060	3442060	She's off spending 100 grand on...
3442060	3444060	All right, so Spencer.
3444060	3446060	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3446060	3447060	You're spilling.
3447060	3448060	She just keeps doing it.
3448060	3449060	I'm sorry.
3449060	3452060	She's like a Ronan Martin's laughing character.
3452060	3457060	How many people are going to get that reference here?
3457060	3461060	Yeah, okay, super nerdy.
3461060	3465060	Fun fact, did that this morning with a cup of water as I woke up.
3465060	3466060	When it keeps falling out of your cup,
3466060	3470060	that's God saying stop drinking.
3470060	3472060	Does it need it?
3472060	3474060	It counts with water, though, too.
3474060	3477060	It's like stop drinking water.
3477060	3478060	It's just a general sign.
3478060	3481060	Yeah, but nobody spills two glasses of water.
3481060	3483060	A doctor told me when I was eight years old
3483060	3487060	that I had a problem with my ears that made me clumsy.
3487060	3490060	Did he really say that?
3490060	3493060	Yeah, I had a doctor who diagnosed me
3493060	3496060	with a severe ear imbalance,
3496060	3498060	which meant that I couldn't measure space.
3498060	3499060	How convenient.
3499060	3500060	Yeah, exactly.
3500060	3502060	And then my mother told me later
3502060	3504060	that she told him to tell me that.
3504060	3507060	Oh!
3507060	3512060	On that dark note, let's enter the cave of Dungeons and Dragons
3512060	3513060	with Spencer.
3513060	3514060	Oh, my God.
3514060	3517060	Spencer, on a rare, unwritten freestyle moment,
3517060	3519060	50 episode anniversary of...
3519060	3520060	That's not anniversary.
3520060	3523060	It's just 50...
3525060	3528060	Last time, our heroes were scouring the depths
3528060	3530060	of the ruins of Merchul
3530060	3534060	on the faraway plain of Twyla, the Twilight Forest.
3534060	3536060	After opening a large chamber door,
3536060	3538060	they entered a treasure room
3538060	3540060	that appeared to house several treasures
3540060	3542060	and perhaps the fabled soul of growth
3542060	3545060	that they had been seeking so earnestly.
3545060	3547060	It was just then they heard a voice
3547060	3550060	echo throughout the chamber that they saw a dragon
3550060	3553060	come into view and immediately began combating it.
3553060	3556060	After a time, they had thought they had gotten
3556060	3559060	the upper hand on the dragon after paralyzing its dick
3559060	3562060	and doing other things to its dick.
3562060	3564060	Together, the group shot arrows
3564060	3567060	and commanded magical scorpions.
3567060	3569060	Sharpie tried to get it to fall over laughing,
3569060	3571060	but that didn't go so well.
3571060	3573060	Grasping its dick firmly,
3573060	3576060	Quark tried to get more into fire arrows
3576060	3578060	directly into the beast's urethra,
3578060	3580060	but that failed as well.
3580060	3582060	Grasping a bear track,
3582060	3586060	Christa Berg managed to snap off the tip of the dick
3586060	3590060	with his trusty trapsman skills.
3590060	3593060	After which, Sharpie cast jump on himself,
3593060	3596060	leaping cinematically onto the back of the beast.
3596060	3598060	Throwing his flaming sword towards the wizard,
3598060	3601060	Sharpie reared back and stabbed it directly
3601060	3603060	into the beast's back,
3603060	3605060	killing it in the last blow.
3605060	3608060	The group stood around to survey the corpse
3608060	3611060	and the treasures they had unlocked.
3611060	3613060	Whoa!
3613060	3615060	Wow.
3615060	3618060	You don't ever need to write one.
3618060	3620060	I think I still will.
3620060	3622060	I didn't feel comfortable with that.
3622060	3624060	They call that crossing the Harmon threshold.
3624060	3627060	You just found out, I don't need to do anything.
3627060	3629060	Well, that's, yeah, that's...
3629060	3632060	That was my, like, not wanting to write.
3632060	3635060	Yeah, but yeah, you've graduated.
3635060	3636060	Yay.
3636060	3640060	Pretty soon, you'll be taking baths instead of showers.
3640060	3642060	Oh, damn.
3642060	3645060	All right, so once again, remind us of our immediate surroundings.
3645060	3647060	So you were in that room,
3647060	3650060	there was, like, a big staircase that led up to where all the treasure was,
3650060	3652060	but there was a huge crack.
3652060	3654060	That's where the dragon came out of,
3654060	3657060	and you were, before the dragon, you were gonna climb up there with rope.
3657060	3660060	But now he's dead, so, like, you don't have anything threatening you,
3660060	3662060	you can look around or whatever.
3662060	3664060	There's two statues, right?
3664060	3666060	There's two giant statues, yeah, at this point...
3666060	3669060	No, there's three, actually, and one of the arms fell off,
3669060	3672060	because you tried to climb the statue, silently mooring,
3672060	3674060	and it knocked off its arm, because, yeah.
3674060	3676060	Because it was made of vodka.
3677060	3679060	She spilled the arm.
3682060	3685060	It's like chunking goonies, just anything.
3685060	3686060	Hold this map.
3686060	3688060	I am like chunking goonies.
3688060	3689060	True.
3689060	3690060	Whose turn is that?
3690060	3692060	At this point, we're not in combat time,
3692060	3694060	so you guys can just do whatever you want.
3694060	3695060	Yeah, but there's...
3695060	3696060	I start a party.
3696060	3697060	Yeah.
3698060	3700060	You guys just killed a dragon, sure.
3700060	3702060	Dragon dick party!
3702060	3707060	Guys, it's my dragon dick, there's a ten dollar cover.
3707060	3711060	This is per Genevieve's recommendation, which is so good.
3711060	3713060	Can I cut off the dragon's horn?
3713060	3715060	Yeah, yeah, definitely.
3715060	3717060	It actually has two horns.
3717060	3719060	Can I cut off both of them?
3719060	3720060	I put blades on my...
3720060	3722060	I put my swords on my legs and on my arms,
3722060	3724060	and I do, like, a slide.
3725060	3726060	Is that a thing?
3726060	3729060	She spills the knives to the floor.
3730060	3732060	Oh, the way that you're looking at me, Dan.
3732060	3733060	I'm sorry.
3733060	3735060	You put swords at night on your arms?
3735060	3736060	Yeah, on your legs.
3736060	3737060	They're double plated.
3737060	3739060	On my legs, and I get at the forehead,
3739060	3742060	and I slide down, like, spread eagle.
3742060	3743060	Does anyone understand my name?
3743060	3744060	Don't try to cut off the dick.
3744060	3746060	No, I already did it.
3746060	3748060	No, I don't get it.
3749060	3750060	Yeah, yes.
3750060	3752060	Like a kick.
3752060	3754060	Like a cutting kick.
3754060	3756060	Why are you trying to saw it off?
3756060	3758060	I mean, women are different because women have more strength
3758060	3759060	than their legs than they do on their arms,
3759060	3762060	so it's more at the top of my mind than my arms.
3762060	3763060	So I put blades...
3763060	3764060	Can I put my...
3764060	3765060	How many swords do I have?
3765060	3766060	A thousand?
3766060	3768060	You have a long sword.
3768060	3770060	You have one long...
3770060	3771060	Okay.
3771060	3773060	But you're tied to your foot.
3773060	3774060	Do you want my rope?
3774060	3775060	I have rope.
3777060	3778060	I've got, like, three...
3778060	3779060	I've got, like, three swords.
3779060	3780060	I can just...
3780060	3782060	I tie all of my swords to Mulrane,
3782060	3783060	so she's...
3783060	3785060	She's bristling with swords.
3785060	3787060	I tie a dragon's dick to her thigh.
3787060	3789060	It's like dead poet society.
3789060	3791060	Everyone's just giving her swords.
3791060	3796060	Okay, so Spencer, my idea is that I have a sword tied
3796060	3797060	to my left calf...
3797060	3798060	Okay.
3798060	3800060	...and a sword tied to my right calf.
3800060	3801060	Where is the dick?
3801060	3802060	Where is the dick?
3802060	3805060	The dick is on my head like a top hat,
3805060	3806060	like an Abraham-like top hat.
3806060	3808060	Like a bachelorette party?
3809060	3811060	Like a Dr. Seuss, like a rave hat.
3811060	3812060	Yes.
3812060	3815060	Like the shortest marriage bachelorette party ever.
3815060	3817060	I have a giant dick attached to my head.
3817060	3820060	And I put out my legs,
3820060	3825060	and I slide down to cut the horns off at the same time.
3825060	3828060	It feels like there's a more efficient way to achieve this.
3828060	3830060	Hey, hey, hey, Chris, Chris.
3831060	3832060	This is not about efficiency.
3832060	3834060	I'm trying to do it in one move.
3834060	3836060	This is about having a party.
3836060	3837060	No, it's not.
3837060	3838060	I'm trying to do it in one move.
3838060	3839060	Is there a different...
3839060	3841060	Get both of the horns in one move?
3841060	3842060	Yeah.
3842060	3843060	Okay.
3843060	3846060	See, now this makes slightly more sense.
3846060	3847060	I hear you.
3847060	3848060	I hear you, okay.
3848060	3849060	The idea is I want to get them at the same time,
3849060	3851060	and my arms aren't as strong.
3851060	3854060	Aren't the tying like different turns?
3854060	3855060	What's up?
3855060	3857060	I mean, like I said, you're not really in combat time.
3857060	3858060	You guys can do whatever.
3859060	3861060	Yeah, so the whatever you want to do is be awesome.
3861060	3863060	Yeah, so you're tying swords.
3863060	3864060	I want to go with Christa Berg.
3864060	3866060	I want to transcribe as much of this blood...
3866060	3867060	Yeah.
3867060	3868060	...blood spell book as possible.
3868060	3869060	You want to study this book?
3869060	3870060	Yeah.
3870060	3871060	Okay, all right.
3871060	3873060	Or Genevieve suggested a sword cartwheel,
3873060	3874060	if that's a possibility.
3874060	3875060	A sword cartwheel.
3875060	3877060	Either way, either way.
3877060	3879060	Legs, cartwheels, ropes.
3879060	3881060	I mean, it's true to my own spirit
3881060	3884060	if I just slide down with that too.
3884060	3886060	Huddling together, Christa Berg and Sharpie
3886060	3888060	pour over the book, trying to study,
3888060	3891060	while Mulrein ties blades to her legs.
3891060	3893060	Hey, what's she trying to do?
3893060	3894060	Doesn't matter. Read.
3894060	3895060	Read.
3895060	3896060	All right.
3896060	3897060	So I read the book.
3897060	3899060	Okay, you guys are reading the book.
3899060	3901060	I get naked while this is happening.
3901060	3903060	Walk up to the top of the steps of my loot
3903060	3907060	and lay down in kind of like a Greek, like urn pose,
3907060	3909060	like just nude on my side,
3909060	3910060	and watching them read the book
3910060	3912060	and watching Mulrein tie swords to herself,
3912060	3914060	I just start like serenading the whole thing.
3914060	3916060	Well, actually, your serenade is so powerful
3916060	3918060	that everyone stops what they're doing
3918060	3920060	and is paying attention to your sermon.
3920060	3922060	Well, it's not a sermon.
3922060	3928060	Oh, the dragon's dick is severed.
3928060	3930060	Okay, guys, go ahead.
3930060	3931060	No, I'm sorry.
3931060	3932060	Do what you were doing.
3932060	3933060	Did you ask what they were saying?
3933060	3936060	I was just quietly being nude and playing my loot.
3936060	3939060	You're not being quiet and playing the loot.
3939060	3942060	There's no...
3942060	3945060	Okay, I play the lady in red.
3945060	3948060	A song that nobody will notice.
3948060	3951060	Mulrein climbs to the top of the dragon
3951060	3953060	and doing the maneuver she had mentioned earlier,
3953060	3956060	which I'm still not fully understanding,
3956060	3958060	manages to knock.
3958060	3960060	It's very awkward and strange.
3960060	3961060	Arms are used for doing things.
3961060	3965060	Legs are used for moving people around.
3965060	3966060	No, legs are...
3966060	3967060	I take the dragon dick back.
3967060	3968060	Legs are strong.
3968060	3969060	Legs are strong.
3969060	3970060	They can be strong, but they're not...
3970060	3971060	Ladies, legs are strong.
3971060	3973060	They don't handle swords.
3973060	3974060	Thank you.
3974060	3975060	They don't...
3975060	3978060	Swords attached to her thighs.
3978060	3980060	I take the dragon dick back.
3980060	3982060	I take the dragon dick back from the head
3982060	3984060	because I think it's going to get injured.
3984060	3985060	Yeah, yeah.
3985060	3986060	Well, that happens.
3986060	3988060	But, I mean, you jump on and you do your thing
3988060	3991060	and that knocks the horns off.
3991060	3994060	Yeah, fuck you.
3994060	3995060	You realize that...
3995060	3996060	Or, I mean, you didn't realize.
3996060	3999060	You always knew that dragon horns are quite magical.
3999060	4000060	It's fine.
4000060	4004060	Fuck everybody.
4004060	4007060	I don't care.
4007060	4008060	I do.
4008060	4009060	Yeah, it's true.
4009060	4010060	I don't know.
4010060	4011060	I do feel like after this experience,
4011060	4013060	I have to go home and think about physics a little bit more.
4013060	4014060	Yeah, I honestly...
4014060	4015060	That was the first thing I thought.
4015060	4016060	Yeah, I like the physics.
4016060	4018060	I'm good at picturing stuff in my head.
4018060	4020060	I mean, wolves' jaws are strong.
4020060	4026060	You don't use them to lift up a manhole cover.
4026060	4030060	Well, I just know that my legs are stronger than my arms
4030060	4033060	and I wanted to cut off both of the dragon's horns.
4033060	4034060	And that is what I...
4034060	4035060	That's what I...
4035060	4036060	Are we still reading the blood book?
4036060	4037060	Yeah, you guys are reading.
4037060	4039060	It's actually going to take some hours.
4039060	4040060	I mean, but, yeah.
4040060	4042060	It feels like we have hours.
4042060	4043060	We take those hours.
4043060	4044060	Yeah, definitely.
4044060	4047060	It seems like that dragon thing took hours, right?
4047060	4048060	It didn't take hours.
4048060	4049060	In combat time, that probably...
4049060	4051060	I mean, in actual, like, time time,
4051060	4054060	it probably maybe took, like, probably not even 10 minutes.
4054060	4055060	10?
4055060	4056060	I just wanted to do it.
4056060	4058060	And you wanted to find out the logistics of it.
4058060	4059060	It's not my fault.
4059060	4060060	Nothing matters.
4060060	4061060	Producers.
4061060	4062060	I'm not here to make friends!
4062060	4063060	Whoo!
4063060	4064060	Just kidding.
4064060	4067060	I'm only here to make friends.
4067060	4068060	But, yeah.
4068060	4069060	So you guys are studying.
4069060	4070060	You're up there.
4070060	4072060	I mean, you're in a room full of treasure.
4072060	4073060	Okay.
4073060	4074060	I examine the treasure.
4074060	4077060	Because they're all fucking about doing book reading
4077060	4078060	and dragon slicing,
4078060	4081060	I go try to get my grubby little fingers in the...
4081060	4082060	Are you still naked?
4082060	4083060	I'm still naked.
4084060	4085060	It's important.
4085060	4086060	You know, it's weird.
4086060	4088060	In D&D, people often get naked.
4088060	4089060	Yeah.
4089060	4090060	Like, not even for any reason,
4090060	4091060	other than to not have clothes.
4091060	4094060	But anyway, you open a treasure chest.
4094060	4096060	I feel like the overlap of people who play D&D
4096060	4099060	and who get to get naked around other people
4099060	4102060	is maybe not as huge.
4102060	4104060	That's true.
4104060	4106060	It's wish fulfillment.
4106060	4107060	In the nude.
4107060	4109060	And no one laughed at me.
4109060	4110060	No!
4110060	4111060	It's the unspoken...
4111060	4112060	Wish fulfillment.
4112060	4113060	That's the unspoken part after every...
4113060	4115060	Let's all literally get naked right now.
4115060	4116060	Everybody.
4117060	4118060	I'm in.
4121060	4123060	All right, so I examine the treasure.
4123060	4124060	You examine the treasure.
4124060	4126060	I said you're opening a treasure chest.
4126060	4129060	The small chest opens with a soft click.
4129060	4130060	On the soft plush interior,
4130060	4134060	you see four identical silver rings.
4134060	4136060	A small inscription reads,
4136060	4138060	Ring of Armor.
4139060	4141060	I put it on.
4141060	4143060	You feel as if you have, you know,
4143060	4145060	you're stronger at blocking attacks.
4145060	4146060	That's one of them.
4146060	4147060	One of them says Ring of Armor.
4147060	4148060	They all say, well, I mean,
4148060	4151060	one inscription on the entire box is Ring of Armor.
4151060	4152060	First of all, before I put that on,
4152060	4153060	I read all of the names off.
4153060	4154060	So Ring of Armor.
4154060	4155060	Ring of Armor.
4155060	4156060	The other one?
4156060	4157060	They're all the same.
4157060	4158060	That's all.
4158060	4159060	Oh, they're all Ring of Armor.
4159060	4160060	They're all Rings of Armor.
4160060	4161060	I take one Ring of Armor and I put it on.
4161060	4162060	And I look down at the two guys reading books
4162060	4165060	and Mulrain slicing dragon horns off with their calves.
4165060	4167060	And I go, everybody!
4167060	4169060	And I throw them in a perfect throw.
4169060	4172060	And I go, everybody, stick a finger in the air.
4174060	4175060	And then I do a little pirouette
4175060	4176060	and I cascade them down.
4176060	4179060	They perfectly land down on each of their fingers.
4179060	4180060	Yeah, one of them does.
4183060	4184060	That's not what I said, Spencer.
4184060	4185060	I said they perfect.
4185060	4186060	Fuck you, dude.
4186060	4187060	Why don't you just hand them to us?
4187060	4189060	Now we have to go around looking for a ring.
4189060	4191060	Why don't you just saw off a dragon's horn
4191060	4192060	and not make a big thing about it?
4192060	4193060	Oh, God.
4193060	4195060	Because they could do it in one swipe.
4195060	4196060	I know.
4196060	4197060	I was inspired by you, Mulrain.
4197060	4198060	I saw her doing it fancy.
4198060	4202060	I think I heard it go in here.
4202060	4204060	I think it's around here.
4204060	4207060	Okay, so one lands on who?
4207060	4208060	Kumail gets it.
4208060	4209060	The other two fall to it.
4209060	4210060	Who's Kumail?
4210060	4211060	That's awesome.
4211060	4213060	No one's ever done to that thing.
4213060	4214060	Extra points.
4214060	4215060	Yeah.
4215060	4218060	You gained 300 experience.
4218060	4219060	Wow.
4219060	4220060	That's true.
4220060	4222060	You can take that to the bank.
4222060	4224060	What's a bank?
4224060	4225060	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4226060	4227060	I've never heard of that.
4227060	4228060	Sharpie gets points.
4228060	4232060	Just thou me no money changer.
4232060	4234060	Can we bend over and just pick up the ring?
4234060	4235060	Dwarves are celebrated bankers.
4235060	4236060	Yeah, yeah, you do.
4236060	4237060	All right.
4237060	4239060	So I bend over and I pick up the ring.
4239060	4240060	People have rings now.
4240060	4242060	I pretend that I caught it with my finger.
4242060	4243060	Thank you, Mulrain.
4243060	4245060	I guess I could just read off other treasures
4245060	4248060	if you want to just look for treasure, save some time.
4248060	4249060	We're still reading the book, right?
4249060	4250060	That's true.
4250060	4252060	Yeah, other than you caught the ring.
4252060	4255060	I fashion a cart and pretend it's sharp to your drop
4255060	4259060	and I just start running around our supermarket sweep.
4259060	4264060	I just start supermarket sweeping it around the treasure chamber.
4264060	4265060	Okay.
4265060	4268060	I tie two carts to my legs.
4268060	4270060	It's going to slow you down, though.
4270060	4271060	It's going to slow you down.
4271060	4272060	Sorry.
4272060	4274060	You find a magical liar of building.
4274060	4275060	I put that in the cart.
4275060	4277060	The magical liar of building?
4277060	4279060	Of building, like a small, like, liar.
4279060	4280060	Like a musical instrument.
4280060	4281060	Yeah.
4281060	4283060	What's in my bag of holding?
4283060	4285060	Most of your stuff.
4286060	4287060	Dungeon snap.
4287060	4288060	No, that's just how it works.
4288060	4290060	Like, it holds, you know, a lot of stuff.
4290060	4292060	So it's just all your, most of your stuff's in it.
4292060	4295060	Well, do you have any idea how much more shit I can put in it?
4295060	4296060	A fair amount.
4296060	4298060	I'd say it's less than half full.
4298060	4299060	All right.
4299060	4304060	Well, I hand that off before I resume blood magic research.
4304060	4307060	I give it to Peabody over there and say,
4307060	4308060	hey, fill this up.
4308060	4310060	Who's Peabody?
4310060	4311060	My friend.
4311060	4312060	My lifelong friend.
4312060	4313060	Quark.
4313060	4314060	Quark.
4314060	4315060	I'm Peabody?
4315060	4316060	I don't know.
4316060	4317060	Please.
4317060	4318060	It's my nickname.
4318060	4319060	You're...
4319060	4324060	I also attempt to call in Peabody in order to affect more...
4324060	4325060	Yeah.
4325060	4326060	Hey, Peabody.
4326060	4328060	What is it, snickerdoodles?
4328060	4329060	That's not...
4329060	4332060	Call me Chris DeBerg in full.
4332060	4333060	All right.
4333060	4335060	What is it, Christopher?
4335060	4338060	Peabody also do what you're doing for Quark.
4338060	4339060	Oh, Sharpie.
4339060	4341060	Only my friends can call me Peabody.
4341060	4342060	And you know what?
4342060	4343060	Okay, Peabody.
4343060	4344060	You're my friend.
4344060	4345060	I knew it.
4345060	4346060	All right.
4346060	4347060	So I do what he said.
4347060	4348060	That was heartwarming.
4348060	4349060	I really was.
4349060	4350060	I'm happy.
4350060	4354060	You also find the goggles of minute seeing.
4354060	4356060	Like binoculars?
4356060	4357060	Well, no.
4357060	4361060	I mean, they're like little goggles that strap on your head.
4361060	4362060	They just see sand.
4362060	4366060	I mean, you don't know what they just see until you put them on.
4366060	4367060	I'm small.
4367060	4368060	Can I have those?
4368060	4369060	I want those.
4369060	4371060	I'm going to crawl the holes and do my Newt seeing.
4371060	4374060	Yeah, I don't want that shit.
4374060	4375060	Okay.
4375060	4376060	All right.
4376060	4379060	Can I inspect magic on the dragon's horns?
4379060	4380060	Yeah.
4380060	4384060	They're intensely magical and you feel as if they can be used to power up spells or maybe
4384060	4386060	make magical items or potions.
4386060	4391060	Can I use that on the magic penis to see if it has anything?
4391060	4392060	Totally.
4392060	4393060	Wait, use what?
4393060	4396060	Whatever she used on the horns to find out how good they are.
4396060	4397060	Oh, yeah.
4397060	4398060	You can detect magic.
4398060	4399060	You just know that.
4399060	4400060	I'm sorry.
4400060	4401060	Yeah.
4401060	4402060	You can't detect magic, but yeah.
4402060	4403060	Sorry.
4403060	4409060	So you can do that on the penis and that is also magical and less so than the horn, but
4409060	4411060	still magical.
4411060	4415060	So it's less magical plus I have to hold a penis.
4415060	4416060	Yeah.
4416060	4417060	And it's pretty hefty.
4417060	4419060	She's a heavy penis.
4419060	4420060	Yeah.
4420060	4421060	It's a burden.
4421060	4425060	So as far as the spells go, I don't know what spells are available for these horns.
4425060	4428500	Can I use them to make everybody in the party like me a lot?
4428500	4430100	Well, you don't know.
4430100	4432940	You aren't actually like a proper like wizard by training.
4432940	4434060	You're not a proper wizard.
4434060	4435060	Truth.
4435060	4436060	Dungeon Master.
4436060	4440060	So how do I figure out what they're able to do?
4440060	4443060	I just said what I am and that's not an insult.
4443060	4444060	Yeah, but it's exciting.
4444060	4445060	I know it was awesome.
4445060	4446060	Okay.
4446060	4447060	Thanks, guys.
4447060	4448060	Well, I was doing a bed.
4448060	4449060	I'm sorry, guys.
4449060	4450700	How do I find out what I can do with these horns?
4450700	4455460	You'd have to talk to a wise sage or someone who knows much about dragons.
4455460	4456460	Is that me?
4456460	4457460	No.
4457460	4460100	Hey, it's not me.
4460100	4464340	Would it be Sharpie or he just he's not a sage.
4464340	4465340	He's a mage.
4465340	4466340	Nah, you are a mage.
4466340	4467340	I mean, you know that.
4467340	4469260	I mean, I only know how to kill him.
4469260	4474140	Well, can I can I present the horns to Sharpie and maybe he'll have some ideas.
4474140	4475140	Yeah, definitely.
4475140	4476540	Sharpie, you actually know how.
4476540	4478220	Oh, oh, I should mention this.
4478220	4479220	You all level up.
4479220	4499980	I didn't have a cute up, but yeah, now that you're leveled up, you know, brew potion.
4499980	4501340	That's a feat you have now.
4501340	4507060	So you know that dragons, horns can be used to make potions more, you know, powerful.
4507060	4510620	So like it's expect its effect would be heightened.
4510620	4516820	OK, so I present the the horns to to Sharpie.
4516820	4519380	Hey, we're trying to read here.
4519380	4521220	I'm just being a dick.
4521220	4527900	I go around Charles Charles de Berg, Christoper, sorry.
4527900	4534780	And I present my horns to Sharpie and I say, I don't I don't know what to do with these.
4534780	4535780	Do you know?
4536140	4537300	I don't know what to do.
4537300	4540180	I'm a such a I'm a such a dumb little archer.
4540180	4545820	I have no idea what the what the fuck is going on.
4545820	4550620	I immediately get an erection.
4550620	4551620	What is happening?
4551620	4552620	Is that weird?
4552620	4553620	What?
4553620	4554620	I.
4554620	4563740	So we're a weird perversion of, you know, women think that men like dumb women like
4563740	4564740	it's she's.
4564740	4571020	So speaking of Celeste's thing at the end of King of the Nerds.
4571020	4572020	Check it out, guys.
4572020	4578180	Anyway, I'm doing a parody, but I oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
4578180	4579180	Total turn on.
4579180	4580180	OK, all right.
4580180	4581180	Can I.
4581180	4582180	You do that.
4582180	4583180	I redo that.
4583180	4584180	I redo that.
4584180	4585180	Sharpie.
4585180	4586180	Yes.
4586180	4591540	I have in my possession two dragons, horns, put them in one of the bags.
4591540	4592540	All right.
4592540	4594300	First of all, don't tell me what to do.
4594300	4599180	Second of all, I'll put him in one of the what did you say?
4599180	4600180	Bags.
4600180	4601180	Why?
4601180	4602180	Do you?
4602180	4603180	Are you able to measure them?
4603180	4604180	Things.
4604180	4608860	But I want I want you to tell me I want you to tell me what they can do.
4608860	4611100	I hear that you can tell me what they can do.
4611100	4612500	They make potions more strong.
4612500	4615780	I pretend to read the book and not listen to the fight.
4615780	4616780	All right.
4616780	4617780	Hold on.
4617780	4618780	It's very convincing.
4618780	4619780	I'm flummoxed by something.
4619780	4628980	I want to stand atop the nearest mound of treasure and address my people.
4628980	4635420	You ascend a pile of 25,000 gold pieces.
4635420	4639340	Does anyone remember how we got here?
4639340	4640340	I remember.
4640340	4641340	Yes.
4641340	4642340	My dad needed something.
4642340	4643340	I don't.
4643340	4644340	Are we.
4644340	4646500	We wanted to get treasure and fortune.
4646500	4647500	We got it.
4647500	4649380	We wanted to figure out what that soul thing was.
4649380	4650380	What was that thing?
4650380	4651380	The soul of growth.
4651380	4652380	You were looking for the soul of growth.
4652380	4653380	Yeah.
4653380	4654380	That's true.
4654380	4655380	The soul of growth.
4655380	4657420	There was shards for a while.
4657420	4659460	What have we become?
4659460	4660460	Look at us.
4660460	4663580	It's like a Stephen King novel.
4663580	4669900	We are the monsters.
4669900	4670900	We are the dragons.
4670900	4671900	We've lost our minds.
4671900	4676300	I thought it was going cool until that you boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
4676300	4678740	I mean, that was weird by any definition.
4678740	4679740	Yeah.
4679740	4684020	It's not weird because Sharpie and I have had a romantic relationship and maybe that's
4684020	4685700	our language.
4685700	4689460	Maybe that's how we express sexuality to each other.
4689460	4690460	Not weird.
4690460	4693700	Sharpie didn't seem to be on board.
4693700	4694700	I'm fine with it.
4694700	4695700	I'm fine with it.
4695700	4696700	You're right.
4696700	4697700	I'm just trying.
4697700	4699700	Let me try something else.
4699700	4701940	Hey.
4701940	4705940	I'm Quark.
4706580	4710180	Are you interested in these horns?
4710180	4712820	Isn't he on top of the treasure pile now?
4712820	4713820	He's on top of the treasure pile.
4713820	4714820	So you're up there.
4714820	4717620	So can we take all this treasure and bone the fuck out?
4717620	4718620	Can we get it?
4718620	4719620	Yeah.
4719620	4720620	That's always been an option.
4720620	4723500	Let's get this loot and press forward.
4723500	4725580	The soul of growth is not going to grow itself.
4725580	4726580	Well, soul.
4726580	4727580	Well, what the hell did we do?
4727580	4728820	We wanted the soul of growth.
4728820	4729820	What was the soul of growth?
4729820	4730820	It was dragon.
4730820	4733180	I left you guys because you guys were digging about in the woods and I said, I'm going to
4733180	4735060	go try to become a better person.
4735060	4736420	And I saw it out after this thing.
4736420	4738700	Is this the place where the infinite fish landed?
4738700	4739700	Yeah.
4739700	4741940	So we're not even on God damn earth.
4741940	4746780	We're in some weird, is this anyone?
4746780	4750260	What are we doing with our lives?
4750260	4751580	We got eaten by a fish.
4751580	4753180	I have a script too.
4753180	4757180	I mean, that's long since gone.
4757180	4759460	Look, we got dragon horns.
4759460	4761460	We got all the money we can carry.
4761460	4763300	Now you guys can read that book.
4763300	4764700	We can cast some spells.
4764700	4765700	It's been a good day.
4765700	4766700	It's been a good day.
4766700	4767700	It's been okay.
4767700	4768700	It's been an okay day.
4768700	4769700	Yeah.
4769700	4779700	She's got swords all over her legs.
4779700	4783140	All right, so let's take stock.
4783140	4786980	Let's fucking find the most likely exit and get down to biz.
4786980	4789540	The exit of the soul of growth.
4789540	4794500	Then we have to exit the world that the infinite fish vomited us onto.
4794500	4798980	Then we have to like, I just wanted to know what was in the horns.
4798980	4800260	You can't tell me what's in the horn.
4800260	4802060	Well, they make magic stronger.
4802060	4803060	Magic potion stronger.
4803060	4804060	That's the potion boosters.
4804060	4805060	That's a bigger fish.
4805060	4806060	There's bigger fish here.
4806060	4810700	Then let's just leave this area.
4810700	4811820	Stop freaking out.
4811820	4812820	I'm sorry.
4812820	4815140	I'm having adventure phobia.
4815140	4822660	Like I just, I'm starting to feel like I'm, I just, I pretend like I'm asleep.
4822660	4829340	I strike out in the direction tour.
4829340	4831380	There's a light source, right?
4831380	4834500	Isn't there either one who knows where the soul of growth is.
4834500	4835500	I led.
4835500	4836500	Yeah.
4836500	4837500	It's supposed to be in these ruins.
4837500	4838500	Oh, guys.
4838500	4839500	Yeah.
4839500	4840500	Thanks.
4840500	4843580	Isn't this all that haven't we explored all the ruins?
4843580	4846060	No, he's still treasure shopping.
4846060	4850780	Ah, why don't you pretend this is a wedding and go for it?
4851780	4855300	Where, where do we go?
4855300	4858540	We got to go back up because we'd fallen down, right?
4858540	4862100	I just, I just sent the staircase to look for a doorway.
4862100	4863340	You don't see a doorway.
4863340	4867260	However, you do see a massive sarcophagus surrounded by more treasure that you haven't
4867260	4868260	picked up yet.
4868260	4869260	I opened the sarcophagus.
4869260	4872860	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Texas.
4872860	4873860	Jesus Christ.
4873860	4877460	There could be a giant fucking mummy in there.
4877460	4878460	We just killed a dragon.
4878460	4879460	We got horns.
4879460	4880460	We got potions.
4880460	4883980	I hope that means that we want to fight a mummy now.
4883980	4887580	Okay, I, I, I examined the writing.
4887580	4888580	Is there any writing or?
4888580	4889580	Look at this.
4889580	4894580	I should mention you're a literate, but yeah, there's no, uh, just nightmare.
4894580	4903220	Well, just pretending to read special, special, oh, it says no mummy here, uh, say, say, say
4903220	4904220	the word.
4904220	4905220	Jeff.
4905220	4906220	Jeff.
4906220	4907220	Who's Jeff?
4908220	4911460	No, no shit.
4911460	4917180	I pointedly clear my throat and pull out two, uh, uh, a pair of prop glasses that I keep
4917180	4922300	on me and put them on and I examined the, uh, coffin again.
4922300	4923300	No writing.
4923300	4924300	What?
4924300	4926900	Do coffins normally have writing on them?
4926900	4929140	Hey, uh, we're not coffin experts.
4929140	4933060	I wouldn't know.
4933060	4934660	Hire books are technically right.
4934660	4937740	What's this thing made out of, wood, stone, obsidian?
4937740	4938740	I'd say obsidian.
4938740	4945180	Are there, are there any other doorways in this room that we're in?
4945180	4946580	No, there was the one you came in.
4946580	4947580	All right.
4947580	4948580	Well, let's open it.
4948580	4950460	I open the, uh, the, uh, the coffin, the sarcophagus.
4950460	4954700	Opening the sarcophagus, you see a bizarre sight resting in the coffin as a skeleton
4954700	4955700	wrapped in plants.
4955700	4956700	Goddammit.
4956700	4960780	Thin tendrils are wrapped around the body, covering it in ivy leaves and small blossoms
4960780	4965180	and flowers and all manner of different, strange foreign plants cover its body.
4965180	4968900	On the breast of the skeleton is a perfectly spherical amber orb.
4968900	4974060	You can see that inside the orb is a strange plant that is changing states between seed,
4974060	4976580	seedling, shrub, tree and flower.
4976580	4980900	The inside of the orb is always shifting and if you touch it, you get the sense of vitality.
4980900	4981900	The soul of growth.
4981900	4987860	Cause I literally got chills down my spine, just unironically excited.
4987860	4989860	Oh, snickerdoodle.
4990460	4991460	Okay.
4991460	4992460	That's not nobody.
4992460	4994460	It's not catching on.
4994460	4997460	Nobody's on board.
4997460	4998460	Okay.
4998460	4999460	That's another whiff.
4999460	5000460	All right.
5000460	5005060	I, I say Sharpie, uh, you're, you're kind of the, uh, the, uh, the Hannibal of this
5005060	5006060	A-Team.
5006060	5009300	Why don't you go up there and, uh, you're like, all right, play the right song.
5009300	5014780	When I pick it up, uh, I pick it up.
5014780	5016500	You pick it up.
5016500	5019680	You feel nature's magnificence filling you.
5019680	5027560	It's obviously a powerful artifact.
5027560	5030720	You get the sense that it's the soul of growth or something.
5030720	5037200	It swirls like well water in my head, but if I focus, I can feel it.
5037200	5040840	A million thoughts of a million people calling out.
5040840	5042000	Whoa.
5042000	5045680	Dnd cliffhanger.
5045680	5049040	Thank you, Genevieve.
5049040	5062640	Thank you, Erin McGathey, Camille Nuggiani, Spencer Crittenden, one more time.
5062640	5063860	We did it.
5063860	5068560	We found the soul of growth.
5068560	5073360	Yeah, we don't want to go down the road and pick it and choose it, but I'm going to say
5073360	5076000	worst D&D chapter ever, right?
5076000	5077420	No, that was a shit fest.
5077420	5078420	Just by any metric.
5078420	5081600	Like, if you measure it by how much we got done, zero.
5081600	5082600	Nothing.
5082600	5083600	We hung out.
5083600	5084600	We went shopping.
5084600	5085600	Nothing happened.
5085600	5088800	It was like watching, I imagine, like watching Desperate Housewives or whatever you call
5088800	5092080	it, like the Real Housewives of Orange County or whatever.
5092080	5096280	Usually people say, we look for treasure, and I say the names of the treasure, and people
5096280	5099040	don't interrupt me, and I finish explaining all the treasure.
5099040	5101600	Oh, baby, that's not a critique on you.
5101600	5102600	I know.
5102600	5103600	No, I don't think it is.
5103600	5104600	It's a critique on us.
5104600	5106080	If you want more things to happen.
5106080	5107080	Oh, no, no.
5107080	5108080	Baby, baby.
5108080	5114640	That's not, that's not, everyone knows that you're good at what you do.
5114640	5115640	I'm saying-
5115640	5116640	I'm trying to help.
5116640	5117640	No.
5117640	5119560	Well, don't, I mean, we're unhelpable.
5119560	5121560	We're the worst.
5121560	5122560	Sometimes we're just-
5122560	5123560	That was madness.
5123560	5125560	I still enjoy it, just to be clear for everyone.
5125560	5126560	I think it's okay.
5126560	5127560	I love it.
5127560	5131760	Like my friend Neil Goldman used to say on Community, like, a bad piece of pizza is still
5131760	5132760	pizza.
5132760	5133760	That's what I would say.
5133760	5137320	You know, you read the Onion AV review, and you go, eh, whatever, it's still an episode
5137320	5138320	of Community.
5138320	5142640	Yeah, I mean, after playing D&D a million times, I'm still intimidated.
5142640	5145480	I'm going to do something wrong in some way, but like it was still-
5145480	5149520	Well, I assume you're over that anxiety now.
5149520	5152840	I think we've all leapt headlong over that.
5153280	5156200	Well, I know, but I still feel like I'm going to fuck shit up.
5156200	5159400	Even when I do something bold, like open a sarcophagus, everybody freaks out and tells
5159400	5160400	me I'm a bad person.
5160400	5161400	That's just me.
5161400	5162400	I'm a chicken.
5162400	5164240	I just want to look at things.
5164240	5169320	Can I speak to that, is that you're from an age in which D&D was very much about torturing
5169320	5171560	players by the dungeon masters.
5171560	5175080	You'd walk into the room, and the door would eat you, and if you kill the door, then the
5175080	5179000	floor will try and strangle you, and if you do that, there's a treasure chest, and if
5179000	5181320	you open that, that'll bite your face off.
5181320	5182440	That's literally how it goes.
5182440	5186760	So it makes a lot of sense that your style is very cautious.
5186760	5189640	Well, you're acting like it's a generational thing.
5189640	5190640	It is, no.
5190640	5197840	For 25, after the spin doctors, we started like- you walk up to an owl bear, and you're
5197840	5201960	like, fuck you, what are you, an owl or a bear?
5201960	5205960	A lot of those monsters, there was a thing that was a tree stump with a rabbit on it,
5205960	5209920	but if you approached it, it would eat you.
5209920	5213440	Those got phased out because they weren't fun, they were just torturous.
5213440	5214440	That's interesting.
5214440	5215440	I didn't know that.
5215440	5216440	Yeah, yeah.
5216440	5219960	So like Gary Gygax loved that shit, so, but I mean, as the game evolved, it kind of-
5219960	5221280	You know, I talked to him on the phone.
5221280	5222280	No.
5222280	5223280	Is he dead?
5223280	5224280	I think- yeah, he's dead.
5224280	5225280	He's- yeah.
5225280	5226280	I talked to him on the phone once.
5226280	5227280	Yeah, I-
5227280	5230200	Rob Schraub made a comic book called Scud the Disposable Assassin.
5230200	5238280	When I was- when I was your age, young man, we had a- we did an issue of the comic book
5238280	5242920	that was like a special, like, Scud went to D&D World for an issue, and we wanted to
5242920	5248360	have the cover be like a- and I had- I talked to- we were looking for a specific artist.
5248360	5251160	The guy, what was his name, Teasley, Beasley, Easley?
5251160	5252160	Yeah, Teasley.
5252160	5253160	Yeah.
5253160	5258800	We wanted to- the old school, like, first edition Dungeon Master's Guide, like, we wanted
5258800	5264600	that style of oil painting for the cover of the thing, and the only guy that had that
5264600	5269080	guy's number was Gary Gygax, and I had to kind of talk to him on the phone and just
5269080	5273800	talk to him for a little bit, and then I think he died a week later, and- also, you know
5273800	5274800	who else died?
5274800	5275800	Kenwa Akibi.
5275800	5276800	Author.
5276800	5277800	He's dead.
5277800	5283520	He's another guy that I've been bringing up lately.
5283520	5286360	Who should I bring up tonight, like, randomly?
5286360	5291680	I think half of the- half of the members of Enigma are gonna- are in trouble.
5291680	5293560	There's gonna be a weird private jet crash.
5293560	5296600	Alright, so, I'm in 50- 50 podcast episodes.
