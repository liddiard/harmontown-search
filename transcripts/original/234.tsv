0	14240	Oh man! Hello everybody! Welcome! Hommentown is now in session! Let's hear it! Come on!
17280	24240	Welcome to the back of Nailedown Comics! Let's bring out Spencer! Spencer!
24240	33840	Spencer, right here. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Rob Shrub. I will be controlling in
33840	40880	the place of Jeff Davis who could not be here tonight. How y'all feeling tonight? You everybody
40880	47200	feeling good? Alright, let's bring out the mayor of Hommentown, Mr. Dan Harmon!
55040	57040	Ahhhhhh!
71760	73680	And sit! And sit down, sit down!
73680	78480	Yay! It's 8-12!
85760	86720	Now explain that.
89120	96000	When you were in the bathroom at El Capadre, Rob Shrub shot me a mischievous look. I said,
96000	100240	now Rob, that's not a normal man's look. You've got something cooking up right in your mind right
100240	108960	now. And what did you say, Rob? Well basically, he suggested that we do what you just saw happen.
110720	118720	Like, what did you, you tweeted them? I didn't tweet shit, man! I've been on Twitter since Bill
118720	128560	Paxton died. We lost Bill Paxton. I'm really bummed out about that. Who's really bummed out about that?
128560	137040	Game Over Man! Some people make fun of it. Yeah. I'm pretty sad about it. Saying Game Over Man is
137040	142240	definitely trivializing a human being's death. Yeah. I would say. I got a lot of misguided people
142240	146560	when Harold Ramis died, you know, like, oh he's seeing Vinkman on the other side now. It's like,
146560	152400	don't, don't do the, don't do the thing where you, like, you know, relate their death to their
152400	158240	product. Like, I don't think. Not, not, not when you're genuinely trying to eulogize. You know,
158240	164560	do it, do it in the privacy of your own bedroom. When did you find out? Uh, I don't know, this
164560	172480	morning, I guess. Yeah, I mean, like, it was just, it just hit me. Yeah. It was like, so, he's like,
172480	176960	one of those guys that you think is going to be around forever, and he's just gone, you know.
177040	182400	It's like Miguel Ferrer died earlier this year, you know. It's. And we also recently lost to
182400	191360	Milo Yiannopoulos. You don't know when it's going to happen. All of a sudden, just,
193280	198000	somebody will be complicated in surgery. Some people, somebody will dig up a year-old interview
198000	202160	where you sound a little bit like you're, you're all right with pedophilia, and then you're,
202880	207760	and then you're just gone. I, I want to really just congratulate Simon and Schuster. They really
207760	215040	went out on a limb there to, uh, cancel a book deal after rediscovering someone's highly
215040	221520	publicized remarks on pedophilia. Yeah. I think the second time it became publicized, it was really
221520	227680	just the right thing to do at the time. Oh wait, now that's going to be unprofitable pedophilia,
227680	236080	oh no. All right, well, we thought it was one of those one times. It's too bad because he's such a
236080	242800	nice, likable person. It's just like, it's like, well, as you can always explain, he was just,
242800	248320	he was just being funny. He was just very funny. He was just a very funny person. He would always
248320	253760	say, yeah, I think the funniest thing about him was how he would continually talk over anyone
253760	258560	whose show he was on. He had no basic improv training. He would not give and take. He would
258560	263840	just like, like no matter what show he was on, you would just be hearing him talking over anyone that
263840	269600	was always talking. Not a funny person and not a talented person, just a tragic attention whore.
269600	276480	And that's fine. The thing is, I find the irony to be as soon as, as soon as Breitbart, uh, the,
276480	282480	you know, lost him, uh, whether he quit or got fired, it was like, and then I watched the Joe
282480	286320	Rogan thing where he was like talking about getting fucked by his priest or whatever. And it
286320	291040	was like, I think the interesting thing about the left versus the right is that the left would like
291040	297680	to hear about your bullshit. Like after we know it's related to human trauma and the right would
297760	301520	like to, uh, hear about it right up until that, that, that, that time.
310880	314320	Five dollars gets you the video subscription to harm of town.
316560	321440	See what Rob shrub is doing. All right. Well, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna try to do a regular show
321440	328160	tonight. Come on. Come on. It's the Oscars. It's the Oscars. Thank you for not going to the Oscars
328160	335920	are on right now on the Oscars are who's one, who's two suicide squad.
335920	342160	La La Land can suck, suck my dick, dick.
350800	354880	And it can too. I saw this concoction.
359120	362160	That's, that's front Bronco. That's what Jeff user drinks.
362640	364400	I feel like reanimator, man.
371120	375760	My, my thoughts on Milo were very cogent and timely and now they're lost to the ages.
377760	382320	How are you doing, Dan? I haven't seen you in a while. We discovered some new planets, Rob.
382320	390240	Okay. Have they been named yet? No.
392400	398080	How many planets? I don't know. Let's name them. I don't know. I think I don't know anything that
398080	402000	you don't know. I don't, NASA like, like said on Monday, they said, we got some shit coming out.
402000	405760	Then on Wednesday they were like, here's the thing. There's like some things that there's,
406640	411120	all I was, I was getting it third hand. There was like a, it was, correct me if I'm wrong,
411120	415040	there was a solar system that has multiple earth-like planets. There's like seven new
415040	422240	earth-like exoplanets or something evolving around a single star solar system. So only one star.
424560	426720	So imagine like, how many moons?
429840	435200	Imagine if these planets are like actually like, like, so you've got to figure like before we could
435200	440160	ever even, before we had gasoline, before we had electricity, we had telescopes, we could see what
440240	445120	was going on in the moon. So if these planets are, let's say they all have sentient life
445120	450080	evolving on them, like we would be making first contact with people. Most importantly, even if
450080	454400	they weren't, even if they weren't technologically more advanced than us, they would already be,
454400	459280	if they had telescopic contact with each other, they would already be like the New York to our
459280	464640	Wyoming. They would be, because they would have grown up like in the year 1400, they would have
464640	470080	known there were fish people on the planet, like a couple of orbits over. What if the fish people
470080	475520	were like a hundred years behind us? Or ahead of them, whatever, it doesn't matter. Like we,
475520	481360	we will be making contact with a solar system that will be like, why are you people so racist?
481360	489200	Because like, like, like when we were getting to that point, we could see fish people waving at us
489200	495040	and we could also see them beating up snake people next to them. And we could, we were like monkey
495040	499520	people next to giraffe people going like, stop doing that. And they were like, you're right.
499520	504640	You should stop doing that too. You're right. And then we're going to be like, we're going to be so
504640	510400	intimidated by them that we're going to be like, not me. I think, I don't know. I just think it
510400	514640	could be an ironic development where they're like, we're like totally technologically the same,
514640	520480	but they're kind of snobby. Like they're more cosmopolitan. And then we end up going like,
520480	525040	like they're looking down on us and going like, you're still racist. And we'll be like, yeah,
525040	530720	that's right. I hate this Mexican guy and he hates me because we're from Earth.
536240	538160	I'm glad you let me get through the thought.
544640	556240	All right. Our, uh, our guests tonight, uh, have a, have a feral audio podcast
556240	558560	called dumb people town. Let's bring out the Sklar brothers.
566720	574080	Thank you. Hey, uh, Rob, did you get that tiny bottle of table wine we sent over to you?
574080	579040	I did. Oh, good. Oh, great. Great. Somebody ate the tiny loaf of bread that came with it.
579040	585600	Well, chef's choice. Okay. So let's get through the twin stuff for a second.
586720	590400	I thought we were going to talk about it. Finally. I want it. Yeah. Finally. It's correct. I actually
590400	594560	want to talk just briefly about the pan, the planet stuff. Cause I always felt like Pluto
594560	601040	got the rawest deal of all. It's like a planet for so like, we think we have job security problems.
601040	608000	Like he had that was like, that shit was locked down for so long. That was diorama lockdown.
608000	611600	That was diorama lockdown to science fair project. Then just be like, yep,
611600	614480	you're not a planet anymore. To me, it feels like the rawest deal ever.
614480	618800	So now what is it is like my very elegant mother just served us nine
621440	626880	dwarf planets. My very elegant mother just served us nothing.
627360	633440	That's what it was. If you're Pluto, I thought I saw some little sniggling about maybe Pluto.
633440	639040	Now it was a planet. Then it wasn't a planet. And now it might be now was dwarf planet for a while.
639040	644720	Then it was on game of thrones. And then now, wait, is rich hall still doing snicklits?
649360	651920	I co-opted the word snicklet to mean a little thing.
657840	664800	An unresearched that injured my head. I thought I saw some little like sub head that was
664800	672560	always related to the NASA conference. They found like all these little exoplanets. Yeah. But then
672560	676880	there was also something attached to that a writer that was like, also Pluto might be a planet.
678640	683280	By us. Yeah. Pluto. I know. Remember all those people say Pluto wasn't a planet. It is actually
683280	688560	now a planet. It is again. No, no, I don't know if that was just an attachment on the little PS.
690320	694720	All right. We want to talk about twins. Let's get into it. Let's fucking get into it. Bill
694720	698640	Paxson. Let's talk about Bill Paxson. Is it the size or is it the distance from the sun?
698640	704000	What is the issue? For twins? I think it's no. How do you get your power?
706640	709840	We have to say equidistant from the sun or one of us dies.
710800	713760	It's a very difficult thing to manage when we're not together.
716240	721280	Actually, I actually found out about Bill Paxson last week. What? Yeah. Yeah. My phone's got crazy
721280	725760	alerts. Alerts. Yeah. That's cool. And I just seen the movie Arrival so I can actually see
725760	729600	into the future now. So that's good. See, you're trivializing a human being's death. Hey,
731280	734640	I just know I'm never getting LASIK surgery. That's one thing I'll never do
734640	740960	because you died of complications from LASIK surgery. No, I made that up. I totally made that.
742640	747040	Wow. I thought it was because your glasses are the only way we could tell you from your brother.
747040	754480	Yeah. But really I have no heart and no soul. Yeah. I was thinking I might watch a simple
754480	759360	plan tonight. You guys like a simple plan. So good. So fucking good. Particularly like Bill
759360	762960	Paxson in that movie. I don't know how we're going to do it. He was great. And then Billy
762960	768400	Bob Thornton, just nobody, he's got the most powerful, like quiet voice in all of movies. He
768400	774400	just, he says it so quietly. You ever see one false move with Bill Paxson and Billy Bob? No,
774400	780000	I have not. Really good. Really, really good. It's the simple plan of movies. No.
781520	790720	Trying to do my Billy Bob Thornton impression. It's good. Working hard. I like mashed potatoes.
790880	797600	What else do you like, Billy Bob? I'm going to just start showing you objects.
798720	801120	Do you like tiny wine? I like tobogganing.
802960	808080	Okay. That goes well with mashed potatoes. What else? I don't like being questioned by
808800	818320	Canadian interviewers about my band. What is he looking at? I don't know what Billy Bob is looking
818400	822880	at. I'm focusing. Just down on the floor. I have to focus all of my energy into my
823680	828080	impersonation lobe. I love it. I'm not going to, I'm not going to do a fucking awesome
828080	832800	Billy Bob and then also be like, who wants pizza? That's right. Or make eye contact. Or yeah. Or
832800	844480	make eye contact. Yeah. At the very least. I like mashed potatoes and gravy. See, it doesn't work.
844480	849360	No, you went from zero eye contact to the creepiest, I will never look away from you eye
849360	856080	contact. He looked through Jason to me. Like that's how. Would you ask Tom Petty about his influences?
857120	863520	Yes. Yeah. I would. You've seen that Canadian, that clip, right? Yes. Fucking amazing. That's
863520	872080	my favorite part. Would you ask Tom Petty about his influences? Pause. Pause. Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
872080	876400	It's one of the first things I asked. What you want to know? Yeah. That's the first thing they
876400	883360	cover in the Bob Donovich thing. It's a sidebar item on Wikipedia for all musicians. Right.
883360	890240	If you Wikipedia Prince, it says what his influences are. What are Prince's influences?
890240	902000	Billy Bob. What are Prince's influences? Oh, yeah. Oh, Prince's influences are
902640	908640	Oh God. I'm trying to hold it. Captain EO.
910480	917200	For sure. For sure. David Bowie. Feel that. Feel it. You started with Captain EO and then went to
917200	925840	David Bowie. In that order. In the order of most influential. Captain EO. David Bowie. Yeah,
925840	932640	David Bowie. Not a close second, but definitely a second. The Muppets.
934720	939440	James Brown. All right. All right. Twin stuff. Sorry. We made you jump off. Twisters. Oh,
939440	944320	twin stuff. All right. All right. So what? So what do you guys do? Do you have private time? Do
944320	949200	you go like at the end of the day? Like do you go? Okay. After tonight, do you go home? Do you live
949200	955360	in the same house? Yeah. Like if one of you stubs their toe, do you the other feel it? No, we
955360	962080	now come on. Somebody stub this guy's toe. Hang on a second. That is an extraordinarily fair
962080	967920	question. That is a super valid question. I don't want to stomp on the validity of that question. I
967920	972560	don't want to stub my toe on the validity of that question. I don't stub my nose in the, in the face
972560	981680	of that question. Good. Uh, no, although quite simply, that is bullshit. Such horseshit. Although
981680	988560	I will say this, I will say this. Uh, recently we were, we were about to go do some shows on the road
988560	993040	and when we have a really early morning flight, we'll call each other in the car as we're driving.
993040	1004320	We don't live in the same house. Um, we both, yeah, we, we both have two families. We live on the
1004320	1011120	only kibbutz in LA. Yeah. It's a communal living site. So we're driving. We always, I will call
1011120	1015440	him always, or he'll call me just to make sure that the other one woke up and is coming to the
1015440	1022880	gig. And, uh, and so he called me and I couldn't take the call because I had stopped because I had
1022880	1028080	to pee so badly, like uncharacteristically, so badly. I had already peed in the morning. I was,
1028080	1032960	I had stopped at a 7-eleven, which someone told me, dummy, they don't have bathrooms at 7-eleven.
1032960	1037520	I didn't know that. I went in and got into a fight while I had to pee with the guy. I was like, you
1037520	1042160	have to pee somewhere. Like, I don't know why I got into it with him at that point. Then I was
1042160	1048480	like, fuck it. I'm going to walk outside. I went, it was on Olympic in La Cienega. I went around
1048480	1053360	to somebody's house and on an apartment building and peed on the side of an apartment building
1053360	1058960	because I had no hope. I had no chance. I ran back into my car. I called Randy back and I was like,
1058960	1063040	I'm so sorry. I saw you were calling. I didn't want you to freak out that I wasn't up for the
1063040	1066720	thing, but I had to pee so badly that I just peed on the side of a building. And you said,
1066720	1072640	I just peed on the side of a building. Is that true? No, that is true. And that is so fucked up.
1073360	1079280	That is the most twin thing that's ever happened is that we both drank too much coffee before going
1079280	1086880	to LAX. And then, and that was creepy. That almost made us want to stop doing comedy. That moment
1086880	1093200	right there. But if we looked at your text messages, like, like, are you guys just nonstop
1093200	1096800	checking in with each other? I just wonder, like, I just brought you out as the Sklar brothers.
1097360	1102960	Like, I didn't call you Randy and whatever the other one's name is. Yeah. That's what I do.
1104080	1107600	Jesus. You've been hanging out with us. Like, you've been called brothers. You've
1107600	1111440	been booked as the brothers. You're in Burger King commercials as the Sklar brothers, your brothers.
1112480	1117040	So, so like what, but there's obviously, there can't be any, because you were born that way,
1117040	1122480	literally. There is no buildup of resentment or craving for individuality, right?
1122560	1127200	Unless we find out right now. Jason is not a planet.
1127200	1131760	Yeah. No, I've been demoted. Apparently I don't have a fucking name. Thank you.
1132880	1139680	Billy Bob. No. Well, we have family, like we have separate families and separate lives. And so,
1140720	1145520	you know, like, I think the fact that we, even up into that point, but the fact that we now have
1145520	1152880	kids and wives and we have multiple wives, uh, Phil Paxton. All right. You guys, you guys each
1152880	1159280	have one wife and then you have a third wife that you share. Yeah. Cronenberg, like you swap off.
1159280	1162960	The relief wife. She comes in for the last. We each have second families, but it's the same family.
1164560	1170400	And they don't know about it. So they think it's just the same person coming in. That's the third
1170400	1175120	wife is she just lives in an apartment with what she thinks is a guy named Elijah Sklar. Right.
1175120	1179200	It just comes in. A man who's not a twin. Sometimes he has glasses. Sometimes he doesn't.
1179200	1185680	And he's just super attentive. He's around a lot for her. But the catch is one of you falls in love
1185680	1195040	with her. I was going to say Thursday's on CBS, but, uh, it's just, it's called hidden figure.
1195040	1205440	Uh, all right. Well, okay. Yeah. So we do have our own lives and I, what's crazy is that since
1205440	1211120	we've had our own families and kids and stuff, uh, the, the, when we get together and we hang out
1211120	1217040	with you, can I say this? Is this all right? Uh, we, sure. Thanks, Rob. Yeah. Thanks, Rob. When we
1217040	1222880	hang out. Thanks, Spencer. Uh, we hang out. It just, it's fun. We actually look forward to it
1222880	1229280	because I feel like we enjoy it more now than ever before. Well, speak for yourself. Oh, uh,
1229280	1235040	no. Is there a tone you guys have? Like if you, if you're, if you're by yourselves,
1235040	1240960	the two of you, and then everybody else is gone, does it ever get dark? Like, like,
1240960	1245680	where you just like, you share with each other this kind of like, you're like, oh, that one,
1245680	1250240	you know, like, or something or like, like, you guys are only on each other's sides and there's
1250320	1253520	like some fucking like weird energy between you where you're like,
1254320	1257440	yes. I don't think it's a weird energy. I, oh, I was going to say yes. Sorry. Yeah.
1258160	1261600	No, maybe we're misinterpreting the energy between us. I think it's very normal. You
1261600	1265520	think it's weird? Oh, that's strange. Who the fuck are you? I don't know. It's just,
1266320	1273280	Dan, fuck. Uh, no, I, I think it is, I can describe it like this. I do think it, it goes
1273280	1280160	beyond the normal sibling relationship. It goes beyond the normal, uh, friend relationship
1280320	1285600	like we're past the point where you share things with each other. This is going to sound so bizarre.
1285600	1289680	We are past the point where you share things with each other. And I think because we're
1289680	1294400	twins in some weird way, we're allowed, we allow ourselves to be as hard on the other person as
1294400	1298640	you would be on yourself. So as negative as you would be about yourself, you, and that to me is
1298640	1305920	an intimacy to like rip on someone who isn't you the way you would basically rip on yourself is so
1305920	1311520	intimate. But also I would imagine the upside of that is that you can confide in them and you
1311520	1317680	wouldn't like if I had a twin brother and then I found out, like I was like, wait, oh,
1317680	1323520	redhead cheerleaders. I'd like, I'd like call my brother and go, I think it's redhead cheerleaders.
1323520	1327360	Right. The combination has something to do with athletic socks. And he'd be like, wait, oh yeah.
1329040	1332080	I don't know anything like that. Where you'd be like, you'd call him up and go like, wait,
1332160	1338320	do you, are you, do you hate beans? So that's, that's our journey. I think what you're just
1338320	1343280	describing right there is to get to actually, we're so close to each other. We're actually
1343280	1348320	stepped on the other side of each other facing away from each other. So the key is now over the
1348320	1354640	course of our lives, yeah, to the beginning of a duel. It's literally like it's not to get all
1354640	1360160	Hamilton about it, but the second movie poster from your trailer. It's just that it's called
1360880	1364880	you're facing each other again. Yeah. Gunpoint in between us is a redheaded cheerleader.
1366240	1377680	Socks up. It's the dark version of fabulous Baker boys. Right. Yes. Yes. So now our thinking
1377680	1384160	life is, I think to peel it back and actually have the type of relationship that a close
1384160	1389280	siblings would have. That is our work that we have to do kind of examining yourselves for your
1389280	1394160	individuality a little bit. Totally experimenting with like, kind of like, you know what, like,
1394160	1399040	like actually withholding from each other. Totally. So that there is, yes. And or taking
1399040	1403200	time apart from each other. So when we're not working, we're not doing that stuff. We do spend
1403200	1407280	time with our different friends and family, friends and whatnot. So then when we do come back
1407280	1413200	together, we are actually happy. I have to wonder if this biologically, psychologically mirrors
1413200	1418880	the stage in a normal individual's life when they would be going through some threshold that
1418880	1423520	that's something that I've never heard about in twin studies. We're always so obsessed with like,
1423520	1426960	oh, who, what's the difference between nature and nurture? Let's study these twins. Right. But like
1426960	1433680	that idea that, that twins have that unfettered intimacy and that you guys are experiencing this,
1433680	1440640	this weird crisscross right now. I wonder if that coincides with, with the age at which a person
1440640	1445520	goes through a person would be like, wait, who am I? Yeah. Just in general. I think so for sure. But
1445520	1450720	I think we're, we, we experienced that more because mid twin crisis mid twin crisis,
1450720	1456240	but I think it's also because we're comedians or we are constantly examining our relationship and
1456240	1461040	who we are and what we're about and what's wrong with us and all that stuff. So yeah, we only
1461040	1466480	participated in one twin study ever. We grew up in St. Louis, Washington University. And I don't
1466480	1473200	want to say we fucked this thing up, but like, I had to go into a room and this is no joke. This
1473200	1478000	actually happened. People were studying this. I had to stare. There was like, it was just a
1478000	1482800	little machine that would just light up with a red light. When in another room, Randy was looking
1482800	1490960	at a picture and I'm just looking at a picture and I, for no reason, Rob, just rub my temples
1490960	1496000	as if to send it to me as if to fucking send it through the ether to him. Like, cause I was like,
1496000	1501440	that's what you're supposed to do. And I just had to, when the light came on, draw what popped into
1501440	1508160	my head to see if he could send it across a hallway at WashU. And not only did I not draw
1508160	1513680	even a remotely close shape to anything he was looking at, it was so bad. Like we,
1513680	1518800	they shut down the experiment. They lost funding. They lost their grant and their funding because
1518800	1526240	of our results. What did you draw? What did you draw? I drew, I remember he was looking at a tree,
1526240	1532000	like a very tall tree. And I drew a star, nothing like a tree, rounded edges and all that stuff.
1532000	1537680	You were looking at a cow and I drew, I drew a car. You were looking at what, can you remember
1537680	1542080	any, what the other ones were? I can't. You were, I think, why don't you get in my head and find out.
1542080	1547920	Okay. Let me rub them. But I can't remember. We were so off. It was so off that they couldn't even,
1547920	1552160	it proved to us that we're like that. I don't believe in that shit. I really don't. I really,
1552320	1555760	being a comedian, weren't you tempted to just keep drawing dicks?
1558080	1562160	Every car. He keeps thinking about this. I don't know. It's only 13.
1564560	1566960	The car had a dick coming out of its mouth. This one's really here.
1568000	1570560	Just, I'm sorry, everything. He keeps thinking about dicks.
1570560	1574800	I know you're looking at a cow, but. Cow had two dicks just fucking doing it.
1575760	1582160	Uh, well, I, well, let's, let's, uh, let's bring out Brandon Johnson. Cause he's, uh, he's back.
1582160	1583440	Sure. Love him.
1586960	1587440	Brandon.
1595680	1596400	Hi, Brandon.
1596400	1598480	What is this shit about Pluto, man?
1598480	1599120	Yeah, right.
1599120	1607600	I just heard back there, all that talk about, I don't know what's going on. Is it a planet?
1607600	1612160	Is it not a planet? Riveting, riveting, riveting.
1614880	1621120	I could see Steve Harvey starting like a stand-up act. Just like, what is this shit about?
1622560	1625200	Now, now you a woman, right?
1626160	1627280	Pluto, you a planet, right?
1627280	1627920	You a planet.
1629280	1631920	Speaking of comedy and comedians, I.
1631920	1632400	Hello.
1634400	1637280	I just, I just, I just drew a dick in my mind, Rob. Just.
1638080	1644720	I was at this function and, uh, Martin Short was being given an award and he, uh, he came,
1644720	1648320	he just fucking murdered. Were you guys Martin Short fans?
1648320	1654160	Huge. And then Jim, when he did Jiminy Glick, I was like, that is the most electric character.
1655040	1658800	Martin Short was my guy. Like, like, like, when I was in sixth grade, it was like, that was,
1658800	1663120	you know, I think like a lot of us, we start just by imitating people.
1663120	1665120	Like I would just do Ed Grimley and.
1665120	1666400	From S, you started SCTV.
1666400	1667120	Let's see that.
1668960	1669920	Mental, I must say.
1672320	1676480	Wait, why is Billy Bob Thornton doing Ed Grimley?
1676480	1679200	What? Billy Bob Thornton, why are you so mental, Billy Bob?
1679200	1681680	I want mashed potatoes, I must say.
1681680	1682720	Wow.
1682720	1686320	I must say, I'm completely mental.
1686320	1688480	Oh my God. Oh my God.
1688480	1689440	That's fucking weird.
1689440	1691440	Why are you holding a triangle suddenly?
1691440	1693600	If you do this mouth, you could do John Lithgow.
1698160	1701120	Brandon, who are your childhood comedy people?
1701760	1706400	Uh, I love like the, the Broadway Whoopi was one of the first things I ever saw.
1706400	1711120	The, uh, the young comedian special Robin Williams is one of the first things I ever saw.
1711840	1716240	I had to like, we had an old ass TV and we got HBO and we had dials on the shit.
1716240	1719680	So I had to like, back in the day, if you got cable,
1719680	1722960	you had to hook it up and you didn't have to dial for like maybe a half an hour.
1722960	1726480	Just turn a dial until the cable hooked up with like a raw signal.
1727040	1728160	I fucking remember it.
1728160	1730400	Three o'clock in the morning, dial, dial, dial.
1730400	1733120	And then Whoopi Girlberg around the world in 88 days.
1733120	1735280	And I was like, what the fuck?
1736240	1739120	So you like the character pieces, like the,
1739120	1743200	the one woman show kind of like, I'm going to do 20 minutes as this person.
1743200	1745520	And I mean, that's what you were, you were like,
1747120	1750720	I mean, it's, it's just my earliest memory of somebody who inspired me.
1750720	1754800	But I didn't think like, I wasn't like one woman show type.
1754800	1755840	That's why I was in shock.
1755840	1757840	I was like, this is a one woman show, but it's funny.
1759280	1761600	Like, wasn't you molested when you were a kid or something?
1761600	1762960	Yeah.
1762960	1766640	That's always how you can tell if someone's giving a comment or they hate something.
1766640	1767760	Like I'll hide their voice.
1767760	1770160	Ask me how her one woman show was.
1770160	1771520	How was her one woman show?
1773360	1774080	Hated it.
1774080	1774720	Hated it.
1774720	1778480	Okay. Now, now ask me how her one woman show was.
1778480	1779680	How was her one woman show?
1779680	1780240	It was good.
1781360	1782400	It was really good.
1782400	1782960	Holy shit.
1782960	1783360	Wow.
1783360	1784080	A lot of characters.
1784080	1784560	You loved it.
1784560	1785280	Yeah.
1785280	1786080	A lot of characters.
1786080	1787200	Wait a minute.
1787200	1787920	Wait a minute.
1788880	1792400	That means all of my one woman shows have been terrible.
1793600	1794320	No, they were good.
1794320	1795280	They were really good.
1795280	1796000	They were great.
1796000	1797200	They were great.
1797200	1797680	They were great.
1797680	1798000	Hold them.
1798000	1799200	They were great.
1799200	1799680	Okay.
1799680	1800320	They were all great.
1800320	1801600	Wait a minute.
1802800	1804480	This is a little unrelated, but
1805360	1808480	Shrav revealed to me at dinner tonight that he's going to us.
1811040	1811840	I was there.
1813200	1813840	Thanks, Spence.
1813840	1817200	You were sitting at the next table, though, facing the wall.
1818640	1819520	Why did they make you do that?
1819520	1821120	It's because you didn't order anything.
1821120	1822160	Right. Yeah.
1822160	1822720	I forgot.
1824560	1826480	You got to eat a chimichanga.
1826480	1827840	You want a presence at my table.
1830320	1836720	Shrav revealed to us that he is going to a vocal coach.
1836720	1837360	Yes.
1837360	1839440	Because he wants his voice lower.
1840080	1840560	Wow.
1844240	1845760	That's not completely it.
1845760	1847280	No, he asked you.
1848160	1848720	All right.
1848720	1849200	All right.
1849200	1849840	Okay.
1849840	1851920	How is that working out for you?
1856640	1857680	How is your vocal coach?
1860160	1861200	I hope it's going better.
1861920	1863120	I just started.
1863120	1865680	So you're not going to hear it.
1865680	1869600	Obviously, my knee jerk reflex was, you know, maybe this is a little disrespectful to Shrav
1869600	1874080	like, like, like, because people, we have a tendency to, if somebody were to say to us,
1874080	1876960	like, oh, I'm going to do this, you know, if somebody you respect and you like,
1877120	1879840	we have a knee jerk reaction that comes from the best of intentions,
1879840	1882320	which is we kind of like, we want to argue with them.
1882320	1883680	Like, no, you shouldn't do that.
1883680	1884080	You're fine.
1884080	1885280	You shouldn't change.
1885280	1886080	Right.
1886080	1889440	But I do, but I've inspected it from that angle.
1889440	1890960	And I'm still like, what the fuck is he talking?
1890960	1894960	Why, I just want to bring it up because I just like, I don't, you were saying,
1894960	1898080	Rob, that the guy was saying when you went in for your consultation.
1898080	1898400	Yes.
1898400	1901440	That he said you're holding your breath more than you should or something.
1901440	1904080	Well, I mean, like, right now I'm comfortable in everything.
1904080	1908800	But when I'm, you know, on set and or I'm, you know, in a pitch meeting,
1908800	1914960	if, you know, when I'm having a bad time, I tend to talk fast and not breathe.
1914960	1921680	And I my register goes up and it and it's just learning how to breathe and talk and think and
1921680	1923520	just organize your thoughts and stuff.
1923520	1926160	It's just something that I'm doing to to improve myself.
1926160	1926800	I'm so sorry.
1926800	1927600	We made fun of it.
1928560	1931200	So how low how low do you want to talk?
1931200	1933760	Really low.
1935120	1936560	I mean, lower than this.
1936560	1939520	Like hip, like, I mean, like, I mean, hip.
1939520	1939840	What?
1939840	1942400	Like Hibbert, hip, hip, her.
1942400	1943280	Hibbert.
1943280	1944080	Hibbert.
1944080	1944320	Yeah.
1944320	1945600	The doctor on the Simpsons.
1945600	1948720	Oh, oh, sure.
1948720	1954640	Do people like him full of these people would know that you're about to lose your Simpsons car.
1955760	1957200	Would you want to talk this low?
1959440	1959920	I don't know.
1960560	1963440	I like Ed 209 register.
1963440	1964960	Hey, how was her one woman show?
1966320	1967040	It was all right.
1970560	1971280	Even that guy.
1974240	1974880	It was okay.
1978000	1979600	You didn't really find anything you liked it.
1980320	1981440	Well, there was this one part.
1982560	1983600	He must have loved that part.
1983600	1984640	I actually got it with my boy.
1986880	1988000	Yeah, short came out.
1988080	1989440	I'm sure it was good.
1989440	1989920	It was good.
1989920	1990720	It was good.
1990720	1991200	Yeah.
1991200	1994320	And then, you know, he introduced Chevy Chase.
1996480	1996960	That's good.
2003600	2004640	This is what I'm talking about.
2004640	2010400	You know, when you're when you're talking like this, which is my comfortable register,
2010400	2017360	you know, which to some people is grading, you know, I just like, you know, I'm trying to
2018000	2023040	I'm just trying to fix this fucking problem, which is my life.
2023040	2024800	I think a lot of people like your voice.
2024800	2027760	I think it's what makes a lot of people don't.
2028960	2034160	Well, Rob, but when I first met you, like, I mean, your origin story is your hair piece story.
2034160	2036960	Like, like, like Rob lost his hair at a very young age.
2036960	2037760	19.
2037760	2043040	In a time before Pulp Fiction before it was even possible to be masculine involved,
2043040	2045360	like in cinema before Bruce Willis, like,
2045360	2048240	impossible before saving raves from that movie.
2048240	2048880	Jesus.
2048880	2056720	Well, before and before John, the new captain, goddamn Picard, like, like,
2056720	2062000	there was there were no bald men were, you know, whatever the the hair loss was different
2062000	2063200	as you go up through the ages.
2063200	2064400	I'm not saying it's equivalent.
2064400	2065760	It's pretty much the same.
2067280	2072480	But but you told the story of like, you had a girlfriend that was like, you know,
2072480	2078160	she made it obvious that she said you had hair, you know, maybe you do need a hair piece.
2078160	2082480	And then you went to the you into the hair lions club, the lions club.
2082480	2086800	Yes, you went and you you had them outfit you with a fucking head of hair.
2086800	2091920	So real hair, somebody's hair was woven into a wig.
2092480	2095200	And and and I was like, oh, man, this is it.
2095200	2097200	I'm going to be fucking sexy again.
2097200	2105200	Anyway, and it looks like exactly how you're picturing it.
2105200	2111040	I'm just like, like a hair hat, like a bowl cut round hair.
2112320	2119200	And and I walked home wearing it just like walking down the street,
2122320	2126880	crossing the street and wearing it and then looked myself in the mirror.
2126960	2131200	And I said, oh, shit, I can't I can't do this.
2131840	2133440	And I put it in a shoebox.
2133440	2136720	And then I walked back to the lions club.
2136720	2138960	And I said, I can't do this.
2138960	2139680	I'm sorry.
2139680	2141520	And I gave it back to them and I left.
2142240	2145280	And then I shaved my head and I never had a problem with it ever again.
2145280	2148320	Yeah. So, you know, that was a nineteen everybody.
2148320	2150480	And that woman is now your vocal coach.
2150480	2153440	Yeah. Full circle, guys.
2153440	2155440	Don't you make the equation there with your voice?
2155440	2156720	I mean, who cares with your voice?
2156720	2160000	I mean, like, like, you know, I like me.
2160000	2161280	I like my voice.
2161280	2167760	I just I'm I'm it's all about like when I don't like me and when I don't like my voice.
2167760	2172240	It's it's I'm trying to get over that, you know, part.
2172240	2173520	It's not right now.
2173520	2174000	All right.
2174000	2177280	I mean, I'm not trying to high road you, but isn't it easier to just to
2177280	2179920	to change the way that you feel about yourself?
2179920	2180720	And this is part.
2180720	2181680	Yes, exactly.
2181680	2182160	Exactly.
2182160	2183280	And I think this is a part of it.
2183280	2184640	Well, when you this show.
2184720	2185680	This show right here.
2185680	2190800	No, no, no. Well, the training is like I said to you when I explained while I was doing.
2190800	2191920	In confidence.
2191920	2198800	Yes. When I said, I said, like, look, you know, if it's even if it's a placebo, if I
2199680	2205360	in the past read done the homework and then I've gone into like a meeting where I need to be
2205360	2212000	everything I need to be and everything I know that I need to do and can do, I can do it.
2212560	2214240	But, you know, all right.
2214240	2215680	You know, that's what it's all about.
2215680	2217120	Lots of things I don't like about myself.
2217680	2219280	Uh, what do you like?
2219280	2221920	What I get into it.
2221920	2223600	Top five team.
2225600	2229760	Five teen top five teen things you don't like about yourself.
2229760	2230400	Let me start.
2231760	2232240	Attitude.
2232240	2232640	Wait a minute.
2232640	2233760	We can wait here all the way.
2233760	2236080	No, this is for him to contact.
2237440	2238800	Returning texts.
2239920	2240640	Wow.
2240720	2242720	Your Billy Bob Thornton impression.
2242720	2243040	Yes.
2244400	2245920	Dinner secrets.
2245920	2247360	Time management.
2250560	2251840	What do we just get seven?
2253280	2255200	I'd like a little less hair on my shoulders.
2258800	2259200	Yeah.
2259200	2264800	And I wish I wish that my toe and fingernails didn't grow, but I guess that's a universal human.
2264800	2265200	Yeah.
2265200	2266560	Things is going to happen.
2266560	2269520	I feel like we should have invented that'll happen after you're dead.
2270240	2276320	I wish that the hair on my legs didn't stop, um, just short of my ankles.
2276320	2278480	That was because you were abducted by aliens.
2278480	2280960	That's what you told me like in 1997.
2282080	2282720	Were you?
2282720	2285360	I think it's because I wore my socks too much when I was a kid.
2285360	2286160	I don't know.
2286160	2290880	You said I was abducted by aliens and that's why the hair on your legs doesn't go all the
2290880	2292080	way up to your kneecaps.
2293600	2296240	Well, which one is it harm socks aliens?
2296240	2297200	Which one?
2297200	2298560	I don't remember that conversation.
2298640	2303280	Maybe I was, maybe I was defending myself against a new adult friend who was inquiring
2303280	2304240	about my body hair.
2304240	2304720	I don't know.
2306240	2307040	I don't remember.
2307040	2308160	It was 1997.
2308160	2310160	We've known each other since 91.
2310160	2313680	I thought this was from dinner the other night, you know, tonight.
2313680	2317680	Well, back then in the late nineties, we were getting into alien abduction mythology because
2317680	2321920	we were trying to write a screenplay about alien abductions and things and I was researching a
2321920	2322240	lot of it.
2322240	2327440	So I was starting to think about my frequent nosebleeds and maybe body hair patterns because
2327520	2330000	they were being mirrored in the testimonials in the book.
2330000	2331280	I no longer believe that.
2332400	2335840	I think it's probably, how's your body hair?
2338320	2340640	I think I have more body hair than you do.
2340640	2340800	Yeah.
2340800	2341840	How is that possible?
2341840	2342320	I don't know.
2343040	2344560	But you guys must like text each other.
2344560	2346240	Like, how's your body hair done?
2346240	2348400	And go like, do you have that thing with your nipple?
2348400	2348880	Like, do you?
2348880	2351200	Yeah, I don't want to hear it.
2351200	2351920	We don't text each other.
2351920	2354240	I can grow a beard like in 20 minutes.
2354240	2354640	Yeah.
2354640	2355760	So that I really want to know.
2355760	2358560	Do you guys like actually like, like sexually, do you?
2359920	2360800	Do you exchange?
2360800	2361520	Measure a dick.
2361520	2362320	So hot.
2362960	2363840	Twins.
2363840	2364480	Do you?
2364480	2365760	So fucking hot.
2365760	2366240	No, that's.
2367200	2368240	Do you get that a lot?
2368240	2369200	Oh, man.
2369200	2370160	Twins.
2370160	2370640	And.
2370640	2371440	Twins.
2371440	2372480	And twins.
2372480	2373280	So hot.
2373280	2379920	If one of you experiences something, if one of you were like, try a cock ring or accidentally
2379920	2385200	like twist both your nipples while you were orgasming or you put on a panty hose over your
2385200	2388960	face and swung from the ceiling fan and then you like, come your brains out.
2388960	2392160	Do you, do you text the other one and go like, have you tried this?
2392160	2392480	Yeah.
2393040	2394160	Because you might be into it.
2394160	2394800	You might love it.
2394800	2395760	Because you're genetically identical.
2395760	2396960	I've cracked the code.
2398400	2400880	We haven't yet, but maybe we should start.
2400880	2403120	All those things you suggested, I just made a mental.
2403120	2404320	I was like, maybe.
2404320	2405280	Yeah, it's possible.
2405280	2407920	All those things are people, things people do because they don't have twin brothers.
2407920	2411920	So you guys have a, have a, like, maybe we're all more darker and private and we're a little
2411920	2413920	more suffocated in our cocoons.
2413920	2414240	Right.
2414240	2417120	And you guys are just, they get to be more mainstream.
2417120	2422480	Like, like you just lay the pipe missionary style and roll over and smoke a cigarette.
2422480	2423040	That's right.
2424000	2425840	No, no conversation needed.
2425840	2427680	Tell us about your podcast.
2429280	2431200	Oh, shit.
2431200	2434000	What? Oh, Jesus.
2434800	2435440	Oh, shit.
2437760	2440240	Someone take that tiny bottle of wine away from him.
2440240	2440720	Oh, God.
2441680	2444240	Drop Shrops, sponsored by Franette Bronca.
2446480	2451520	Our podcast is, our podcast is all about us sharing sexual proclivities with each other.
2452720	2453760	It's dumb people town.
2453760	2455920	It's like, it's all those, it's the most of them.
2455920	2457440	I wasn't asking you, Dan.
2457440	2459600	Oh, but I like to hear him talk about it.
2459600	2465280	No, it's just us breaking down three insane stories and going super deep.
2465280	2466080	And the stories.
2466080	2467200	Story number one.
2467200	2468480	Story number one.
2468480	2469200	High voices.
2469280	2470560	No, no, no.
2472320	2476320	It's three crazy stories from the news that we get from our listeners, actually.
2476320	2481680	And then us and Dan Van Kirk, our co-host, along with the guest, we just start riffing.
2481680	2485440	And the stories are just comedy launching pads and we just go.
2485440	2488400	It's kind of like a writer's room before you get down to the actual writing.
2488400	2490560	How much Florida is in there?
2490560	2491760	It's a lot of Florida.
2491760	2495600	I mean, we just, we know so much about it from the first line of like,
2495600	2500400	this person, like everyone, like we can guess the age of people by their behavior now,
2500400	2501760	because we've done a bunch of them.
2501760	2506080	Like usually I know when someone looks like they're 50, but they're 33.
2506080	2507760	Like I can tell that from the whole story.
2507760	2508560	How old is Dan?
2511040	2511760	33.
2511760	2512640	33 years old?
2514000	2515520	Uh, Dan, you're probably just...
2515520	2516480	Yeah, that's about right.
2518640	2520800	I think you're around our age, slightly older than us.
2522320	2522880	What was that?
2522880	2524400	What was that drug in Florida?
2524400	2524880	What was it?
2524880	2526720	Yucka, Flucka, Fooka?
2526720	2529520	Waka Flaka, Flocka Flocka Flocka Flocka Flocka.
2529520	2531280	I think that's a rapper.
2531280	2539360	But, uh, yeah, no, there's always like scissor been like this to every, you know, scissor.
2539360	2542000	The drugs are like going through what Silicon Valley is going through.
2542000	2545680	Like we have to come up with a right that no one's squatted on the domain for.
2547200	2548320	Someone's looking for a drug.
2549040	2551200	We don't want him to go to faggot.
2551200	2552160	Bingo Tots.
2553360	2553840	No, yeah.
2554400	2555040	It's insane.
2555040	2555760	Has that been taken?
2556800	2560800	No, we had a story about a guy on a date who, I think this was in Florida,
2560800	2566080	where he was trying to impress his date and jump over, like from one building to the next.
2566080	2570880	And he didn't make it and slid all the way down between the two buildings.
2570880	2573040	They got closer as it got there.
2573040	2575920	They weren't built properly and he got stuck.
2575920	2580320	And the fire department had to come in to bust the wall down of a Chipotle to get him out.
2580400	2581680	The buildings get close.
2581680	2583360	Is it Tim Burton's?
2586320	2592080	After tried to jump the tower of are you ready for the distance between the two buildings?
2592080	2592880	A foot and a half.
2594480	2595040	How long?
2595920	2597280	Who misses that?
2597280	2598480	It was all this.
2598480	2599520	So he wasn't.
2599520	2603280	Who goes, hey, hey, babe, check this out.
2603280	2605040	I'm going to jump a foot and a half.
2606000	2606480	What?
2606480	2606960	I got this.
2611760	2613200	Call the fire department.
2614240	2615680	Call the fire department.
2619680	2621040	Call the fire department.
2626480	2627840	They punched through the wall.
2627840	2629200	They get him out.
2629200	2633440	And he probably just looked at her and was like, so can I call you again?
2634400	2639040	Hey, I know you're going to punch through the wall, but could I get like a number five
2640240	2641280	and some chips?
2641280	2646080	What if they punched through the wall and it was the wall of the one of the two buildings was a
2646080	2649280	bank and he bolted through and took all the money and ran away.
2649280	2652160	That would be the biggest, the greatest heist ever.
2652960	2654160	The Thomas Crown affair.
2655600	2658080	The Tinder heist of 2016.
2659520	2662320	I mean, I feel bad for that guy because number one,
2662400	2662880	he didn't.
2662880	2664960	He's not doing something stupid in the beginning.
2664960	2666080	He's it's a foot and a half.
2666080	2668800	So yeah, so he's he's as dumb as any of us.
2668800	2670000	I got it.
2670000	2671360	He's just very lucky.
2671360	2672960	I just want the audio.
2672960	2674880	Hey, baby, let me show you some.
2680880	2684080	Just fingernails coming down the bridge.
2687360	2688640	It was a few stories.
2688640	2690640	I know it wasn't like it wasn't like.
2692320	2698720	And it was just magic stories like that.
2702240	2704000	The buildings are too close together.
2705040	2706000	Fire department.
2706000	2706960	My foot's stuck.
2708240	2709520	What is the appeal to us?
2709520	2712960	Is it the same as like watching intervention or hoarders or something like that?
2712960	2717040	Or we just we just want to we just want to look down and not see rock bottom.
2717040	2718160	We want to see another person.
2718160	2718800	I think you feel.
2719840	2720160	Yes.
2721120	2721600	Yes.
2721600	2725680	We must see the top of one person's head at least before rock bottom.
2725680	2726160	Yes.
2726160	2728000	I think you feel better about yourself.
2728000	2732800	But just to know and sometimes we try and justify everything that someone does in this
2732800	2733600	situation.
2733600	2736080	I mean, always like the best move whenever.
2736080	2737920	Which is a healthy exercise.
2737920	2738720	Totally.
2738720	2743520	Like trying to figure out is it the yeah, I mean, the humanity of someone.
2743520	2746000	Well, I guess I've had a day like that.
2746080	2750800	Someone who shits in a pool and then goes into the house and goes into the bed and sleeps
2750800	2751680	with the six year old.
2752960	2754640	Hey, let's get into it.
2754640	2756720	Let's try to figure out what positive thing.
2756720	2759920	First of all, have you ever taken a shit that just makes you tired?
2761600	2762800	We've all been there.
2763520	2764880	You walk out of there like I did.
2764880	2768080	I just do it like a like a three K or something.
2769120	2772000	I have no electrolytes anymore after that shit.
2772000	2772880	I need to lay down.
2772960	2776080	Wait, would you say sleep with a six year old?
2776800	2777920	No, no, none of sex.
2777920	2780560	Just actually literally just go to bed in your bed.
2780560	2781440	Just took a nap.
2781440	2782800	Yeah, just took a nap.
2782800	2786160	Lay down next to a different family's child and then the pair.
2788320	2791360	And then the parents protected him from the cops.
2791360	2793280	The cops came as like, is someone in here?
2793280	2794880	They're like, no, we're all right.
2794880	2798880	Like they were some reason protecting this guy care about this person more.
2798880	2805760	I remember when the cops come though, because they reported a naked man with a machete.
2805760	2807680	Then they figured it was pooping in their pool.
2807680	2808400	Yeah, machete.
2808400	2809360	You left out the machete.
2809360	2811840	Sorry, it is Florida.
2813040	2813920	Yeah, it was Florida.
2813920	2819040	No, but I just I remember back like just the parents not wanting to like involve this.
2819040	2820320	I don't know what they were trying to do.
2820320	2821680	They're like, we can handle this on as well.
2821680	2823120	We don't trust the cops or whatever.
2823120	2824640	Well, you can't discount human empathy.
2824640	2827760	I mean, they must be looked into his eyes when he woke up and we're just like,
2827760	2828640	he's a human being.
2828640	2830800	And then they looked into the cops eyes when the cops showed up.
2830800	2832480	And they're like, this guy's dead.
2832480	2832960	Yeah.
2832960	2833760	No human.
2833760	2836800	But if you shit in my pool, if you shit in my pool, no.
2837840	2841040	I like to think that it's like they didn't know about the turd in the pool.
2841040	2841600	Exactly.
2841600	2844160	When they were sticking up for the cops, they're like,
2844160	2846800	they're like, would you bring that motherfucker out here?
2846800	2847760	We're going to take him away.
2847760	2850000	All right, Billy Bob, just take it easy for a second.
2850000	2853440	We're you know, this country has has room for error and things.
2853440	2855040	Honey, there's a turd in our pool.
2855600	2856160	Get him out.
2856160	2857120	He's right over there.
2857760	2858800	Or the cops left.
2858800	2860720	And then they're like, would you like some lemonade?
2860720	2861840	Would you like some breakfast?
2861840	2863040	Would you like to go for a swim?
2863040	2863680	No, thank you.
2865280	2866320	Wait, what is that?
2866320	2868160	Did you shit in our pool?
2868160	2868960	No, I didn't.
2869760	2874640	So are you telling me on the same night we met you, someone else took a shit in our pool?
2875600	2877200	We sit in the same night.
2877200	2881600	I would imagine a shit in the pool is probably a lot like a water birth.
2881600	2882240	You know what I mean?
2883440	2885840	We all picture the caddyshack bit with the flow.
2886240	2891200	No, but for the person doing the shitting like you're never immersed fully in water.
2891920	2892880	Take it.
2892880	2894560	Yeah, like that was for yourself.
2895760	2898400	Oh, you're talking about the ease of the end user.
2898400	2901440	Yes, just that just so he was in the pool.
2901440	2902640	Then he was in the pool.
2902640	2903600	I think he was in the pool.
2903600	2905200	So he got into this bed.
2905200	2907360	Well, yeah, well, he probably dried off.
2908320	2909520	I mean, he's not an animal.
2909520	2912240	Yeah, I mean, this is he has common sense.
2912240	2914960	Yeah, he's a considerate person.
2915040	2916080	Stupid question.
2916080	2916560	I'm sure.
2918160	2918480	All right.
2918480	2920000	Well, that's probably your favorite so far.
2921120	2924800	That is very run of the mill for the stories that we get and we get a chance talk about.
2924800	2926320	But it's a it's a good fun time.
2926320	2927360	And we love doing it.
2927360	2928560	Where are you guys from?
2928560	2929600	From St. Louis.
2929600	2930560	All three of us.
2930560	2931600	All three of us.
2931600	2931840	Yeah.
2932400	2933680	St. Louis.
2933680	2935680	For some reason, I thought you were from Chicago, Brandon.
2935680	2936080	I don't know.
2936080	2938880	I guess I lived in Chicago for a little bit, but St. Louis.
2939920	2940640	St. Louis.
2940640	2942640	Little town called University City.
2942640	2944000	Good old St. Louis.
2944960	2950240	Good old provincial old twin to be we all three escaped.
2950240	2950560	Yes.
2951440	2952720	Gateway to the west.
2952720	2953200	Yes.
2953200	2955360	They're like, that's the courthouse, the old courthouse.
2955360	2957360	And we're like, why is that place famous?
2957360	2958560	The Dred Scott case.
2958560	2962720	Oh, the case where you could go back up north and get your slaves and bring them back down south.
2962720	2963920	That's why it's famous.
2963920	2965040	Congratulations.
2965040	2966000	That's great.
2966000	2967200	Horrible, horrifying.
2967200	2968160	Really proud to be here.
2968160	2968560	Yeah.
2968640	2971600	What was St. Louis in the Bible?
2973200	2974240	What did Louis do?
2974240	2975200	That's so great.
2975200	2977600	I think it was the patron saint of acid wash.
2981360	2981840	I rock.
2981840	2984000	It was the first dude to rock the STLB.
2985040	2987360	He refused to take on this.
2987360	2988000	You know what, dude?
2988000	2989680	I love growing up in St. Louis.
2989680	2990240	I will say this.
2990240	2994160	I don't know how you feel about that, but I just feel like it did connect us with people
2994160	2996880	that we probably would not have met had we grown up out here.
2996880	3002400	Like, we were just just just, yeah, no, but it did connect the types of people.
3002960	3004000	Yes, that is also true.
3004000	3008480	The guy who when we worked like we worked at a snack bar at a pool when we were 14 years old,
3008480	3012320	the guy who brought us the ice was this tall, thin guy.
3013120	3015200	That's the Keith Longinette.
3015200	3015840	Fucking great.
3015840	3017360	And I hope he fucking listens to this.
3017360	3018720	Keith Longinette.
3018720	3019760	He no, he's dead.
3019760	3021200	He's probably dead right now.
3021200	3024240	He the Longinette family was brutally massive.
3024240	3025280	Oh, shit.
3025280	3027600	By a man with a machete who shit in their pool, yeah.
3029040	3035520	Keith Longinette claimed to us that, and there is no proof of this, no, but we had to just
3035520	3042640	agree with him, that he kicked the longest field goal in Missouri State Class 5A high school
3042640	3043280	football history.
3043280	3046880	And just told us every time he saw this, that's what he did.
3046880	3048960	That to me is like that.
3048960	3051680	I don't think people hold on to shit out here like that.
3051680	3055120	That is just an unbelievable credit and an unbelievable
3055360	3055360	
3055360	3060000	There's an amazing book by Jonathan Franzen that he wrote before the corrections called
3060000	3061360	The 27 City.
3061360	3062240	I don't know if you've read that.
3062240	3063200	It's about St. Louis.
3063200	3063920	Oh, yeah.
3063920	3065360	Amazing, amazing, amazing.
3065360	3066640	Are you just saying that?
3066640	3067120	Yes.
3067120	3067440	Okay.
3070560	3071680	It's an incredible book.
3071680	3074480	It pretty much nails the city in every way, shape or form.
3074480	3077200	But I do, I actually say I do love that.
3077200	3078160	Did you like growing up there?
3078160	3078800	You probably did.
3078800	3080000	I liked growing up in U City.
3080000	3081200	I didn't like St. Louis.
3081200	3082160	So U City was like-
3082160	3083040	It's pretty racist.
3083040	3084400	Yeah, it's pretty racist.
3084400	3089120	But U City was like mostly Jewish, a lot of black families, a lot of multiracial families,
3089840	3090640	tons of culture.
3090640	3092880	It's the city that they recently vandalized.
3092880	3094880	When you see in the national news that they-
3094880	3095760	That cemetery.
3095760	3100080	Our family is buried in that cemetery.
3100800	3104560	So that part was dope because it was great to grow up with like another culture.
3104560	3105520	But the rest is St. Louis.
3105520	3107440	I thought you were saying the part that our family was in the
3108080	3110320	cemetery that was vandalized was dope.
3110320	3112080	Because you guys don't really make the news.
3112080	3113040	The part was dope.
3113040	3114960	I was like, how dope is that shit, right?
3115600	3116000	Right.
3116000	3120640	There have been a black cemetery, but they put an airport over it.
3120640	3125600	It did not make the news like this shit did, but still, it was dope that your people-
3125600	3126080	Thank you.
3126080	3127120	Got kanked over.
3127120	3127760	Yeah.
3127760	3128880	Get on the map.
3128880	3129440	Thanks, man.
3129440	3134640	It's a very twisted relationship that this country has with,
3135600	3140720	I'm not going to blow your mind with this, with Judaism, with conservatives
3140720	3142400	love the fuck out of Israel.
3142480	3143200	It's unreal.
3143200	3146000	They can't get enough Israel because they think of it as like a football team.
3146880	3147760	We love Israel.
3147760	3150400	We love Israel's like this great, amazing-
3150400	3151920	Like the Alabama Crimson Tide.
3151920	3153360	Yeah, like don't fuck with Israel.
3153360	3158720	And anyone that's like chest puffed up and patriotic is kind of right to think that way,
3158720	3159040	I guess.
3159040	3160240	They have great recruiting.
3162080	3163040	They're fucking like-
3163040	3163920	The colors are great.
3164960	3165760	Blue and the white.
3166480	3170400	How do those people reconcile their fucking blatant anti-Semitism?
3170400	3171840	I mean, they really-
3171840	3172400	Go ahead, Jay.
3172400	3174080	You can talk deeply about this.
3174080	3174720	Well, how?
3174720	3175040	I don't know.
3175040	3176320	You just know people close to you?
3176320	3176640	Yeah.
3177520	3180000	There are people in my family, I'm not going to call them out,
3182000	3187600	my family, not Randy's family, that are conservative and because of Israel.
3187600	3192640	And I just want to be like, it's not like if anyone else is there,
3192640	3194000	they're not going to shit on Israel.
3194000	3197920	They might call Israel on some stuff, but they're not going to shit on Israel.
3197920	3201680	Israel's like a good restaurant in a weird, rough neighborhood.
3202480	3204960	They're not, the city's not going to suddenly come in and be like,
3204960	3206560	close this shit down.
3206560	3207280	We need it.
3207280	3208080	It's good.
3208080	3211120	It's like there's a lot of good that comes out of it.
3211120	3215920	So it's a very odd relationship because that happens.
3215920	3217840	I think there's no way,
3217840	3222400	desecration of a Jewish cemetery has not happened even in the Bush administration.
3222400	3224240	I think it's completely because,
3224240	3226560	sorry, I didn't mean to derail this on something.
3226560	3228080	Yeah, and by the way, Jay made a-
3228080	3228960	No, this is part of the show where we're going.
3228960	3233520	But I do think it's because Trump is like, oh, Steve Bannon, come on in.
3233520	3237280	And so now anyone who has like aligned feelings like that,
3237280	3239760	they don't feel like there's going to be any consequences for what they're doing.
3239760	3242480	So now like more and more Jewish community centers are being threatened,
3242480	3244160	more and more, you know, the cemetery's desperate.
3244160	3246640	Dude, Steve Bannon scares the fuck out of me.
3246640	3250400	I'll be like about to pick my daughter up from ballet and I'm standing outside the
3250400	3253920	Jewish community center in Silver Lake where she takes ballet and I'll just be in the parking lot
3253920	3257120	and like people are picking up their kids and my wife will call me and be like,
3257120	3258240	do you hear what Steve Bannon did?
3258240	3260240	I'm like, no, what the fuck did Steve Bannon do?
3260240	3261120	I'm in the parking lot.
3261120	3264640	I'm like, what the fuck did, what the fuck did Steve Bannon do, hon?
3264640	3266080	He's like, no, he thinks there's going to be,
3266080	3269440	this is like the fourth revolution and he wants a fucking civil war.
3269440	3271120	And he wants everyone to fucking kill each other.
3271120	3272080	So I don't know how he's going to make money up-
3272080	3273120	No, I'm goddamn terrified.
3273120	3276320	And I'm a wasp, I am a goy, whatever you call me.
3276320	3277840	I'm a fucking whatever I am.
3277840	3280560	I'm a blob of the fucking-
3280560	3281040	White.
3281040	3281840	You're just white.
3281920	3283280	I'm a white person.
3284960	3290560	Because every time, I've boiled it down now because I'm focusing on my own emotional reactions.
3290560	3291040	Yeah.
3291040	3295440	Like I bought a gun for the 10 day waiting period and I haven't picked it up yet.
3295440	3296160	Yeah, I picked it up.
3296160	3296880	So it's still there.
3296880	3297680	Distracted by that.
3297680	3300240	So it's like Dylan's Nobel prize.
3300240	3301360	But then I left it there.
3301360	3304240	But yesterday, I was like, I'm going to go pick it up.
3304240	3307520	The article I read that made me want to go pick it up was,
3307680	3312240	it was this, they barred the CNN from the thing.
3312240	3312560	I know.
3312560	3316960	For me, it's about First Amendment because I perceive Steve Bannon and that whole plan.
3316960	3321520	I don't know what, those guys, the Nazi part of Trump, and there's a huge Nazi part of him,
3321520	3323840	he's descended from fucking that shit.
3323840	3325440	His brother in the fucking-
3325440	3330720	The only fortunate thing is that they're not upgrading their playbook.
3330720	3333120	They didn't update it for the internet.
3333120	3336480	It includes, I look at all this First Amendment stuff.
3336480	3340080	Every time there's talk about laws against protesting.
3340080	3341280	That's fucking damn it.
3341280	3341760	I'm sorry.
3341760	3343040	Jesus Christ.
3343040	3343600	I'm sorry.
3343600	3344800	I didn't put it on silent.
3344800	3345280	I'm sorry.
3345280	3346080	Please continue.
3346960	3349760	That ringtone does not match your voice at all.
3354640	3357120	Just really delicate wind chimes.
3358800	3360320	Didn't he just tell you he has a gun?
3362240	3363280	He has not picked it up.
3363360	3368240	Dan, what are the other three errands you're going to do around the gun pickup?
3368800	3369520	I just want to know.
3369520	3371040	Got to go to Trader Joe's.
3371040	3374240	I got to drop off this box at the Boss Brothers.
3374240	3376080	I got to pick up your gun.
3376080	3376880	Go pick up a gun.
3376880	3377520	I'm finding out.
3377520	3379760	You got to get some porn, too, just to balance that shit out.
3379760	3384160	I'm using it to measure what I'm feeling and when and what my triggers are,
3384160	3387520	what's going on with me because we're all finding out.
3387520	3388720	Okay, we need to take this seriously.
3388720	3392000	How our perspectives are different, how our neurologies are different.
3393600	3396880	For me, every time this First Amendment stuff comes up,
3396880	3400000	particularly this idea of the press as the enemy and all this stuff,
3400000	3406320	I perceive it as those guys, like that's the velociraptors testing the fucking electric cages
3406320	3409920	because they and or they're just piling up.
3409920	3414800	The zombies piling up against the shopping mall doors in Dawn of the Dead.
3415440	3421760	If they could get thicker and push it down, they would because there's a Nazi playbook
3421760	3424000	and there's a there's a fascist playbook.
3424000	3425440	Get rid of the media playbook.
3425440	3426480	The media.
3426480	3428240	You can't go any further.
3428240	3430080	You cannot continue past.
3430080	3432000	Well, they'll get rid of the media, whether they can or not,
3432000	3434000	by saying this is alternative facts.
3434000	3434800	This is not truth.
3434800	3439760	And there are people fake news, fake news, fake news, fake news.
3439760	3440080	Yeah.
3440080	3440960	Luke and press.
3440960	3444720	It's straight out of the English translation of fucking Nazi terminology.
3444720	3445360	That's what they do.
3446320	3450480	In the 30s, it took six guys and a pair of boots to go shut down the media.
3450560	3454480	You tipped over a fucking press and you and you set fire to a building.
3455760	3457840	They're doing the equivalent of that.
3457840	3460240	And that's that makes me it's their intent.
3460240	3463600	You know, like when a kid hits you in the nuts as hard as he can with a fat
3464320	3466560	and you're like, it's disturbing to you.
3466560	3469200	It's like there's it's separate from whether or not it hurt.
3469200	3473920	It's like the kid thought that he was going to fucking hit your nuts as hard as he could
3473920	3477040	with what he thinks is the biggest weapon he has in his head.
3477040	3479920	And there's an offense there where you go nephew.
3481200	3481840	Whoever you are.
3483280	3483920	Fuck nuts.
3483920	3486720	Like, wait, wait, you don't don't do that.
3486720	3487680	Those are my nuts.
3487680	3488480	And that's a bat.
3489280	3492560	And it doesn't really matter how clownishly ineffective they've been.
3492560	3496800	It's the fact that what they would have when you see their intent,
3496800	3502320	when you see when you look into their dead eyes and see what they would see the future be,
3502320	3505440	would you see that's what that's why these policies are important because like,
3505440	3507040	they don't fucking care.
3507840	3511920	So another parent told me that the other day that they Trump was on the TV and
3511920	3514400	they're like two year old kid pointed and went Trump.
3516160	3520320	Like with this just sad, like the same way you would like because he's like grimace
3520320	3522160	from McDonald's land or the Hamburglar.
3522160	3524880	You know, it's like, like, the kids are learning the mythology.
3524880	3525920	He's not a good guy.
3526720	3528400	Like, you know, I can't say it.
3528400	3529760	I mean, there's just hatred.
3529760	3532240	There's just it's 9 11.
3532240	3534000	No, it's not by our clock.
3534480	3537360	We go by a really specific clock.
3537360	3541840	Anyway, but I was uplifted.
3541840	3545520	I mean, look, I mean, I there is this it's not a silver lining.
3545520	3548720	It's not like and I know that I know two years from now.
3548720	3550000	What is the silver lining?
3550000	3553760	What is the silver lining with any crisis is always that, you know,
3553760	3554800	it's like a forest fire.
3554800	3558960	You should be lining with a zit getting so fucking gigantic that you can't ignore it.
3558960	3560960	The silver lining is that it's ready to burst.
3561680	3566560	It's it's the when those graveyards got desecrated, you know,
3566560	3572400	one of the things that I saw was a Muslim group saying like, hey, can we get to like,
3572400	3577120	you know, it's it's the shit coming out into the open, like where the funny,
3577120	3582000	smart, progressive, decent people have nothing to fear in the light.
3582000	3587840	And and only the bad people will they will they will continue to be more and more recognizable
3587840	3591120	because they will continue to advocate for shadow and darkness.
3591120	3594320	They will continue to say everything should be secret.
3594320	3595040	Everything there.
3595040	3596080	There should be boundaries.
3596080	3597040	There should be borders.
3597040	3598480	There should be all these things.
3598480	3601920	And that is going to be that could be a really healthy thing for
3601920	3607680	admittedly a side of the political spectrum that that in times of peace and prosperity
3608400	3611040	did nothing but someone brought their their chihuahua.
3611040	3613440	And I just sat on a duck.
3613440	3614080	That's fine.
3614080	3614560	That's good.
3614880	3618880	Wait, you don't think the silver lining is that everyone who voted for Trump who
3618880	3622080	believed that their life was going to get better their life because he doesn't give
3622080	3626880	a shit about them gets so much worse that and they lose their health carry and they
3626880	3631040	see that there is no money, lose their money and they see there's no way out but to commit
3631040	3634560	suicide that entire electric dies.
3634560	3637120	And then we lose those fucking people voting in the next election.
3637120	3640080	Yeah, that's called natural levelers.
3641040	3644800	That's human gerrymandering.
3644800	3645840	That's right.
3645840	3647440	We draw a different way to do.
3647440	3652400	Did you see recently we talked about this on our other podcast that Arnold Schwarzenegger
3652400	3653600	just in a random tweet.
3653600	3659760	Did you see this that he was like it's amazing that like when Congress is less popular than
3659760	3665520	like herpes herpes and Nickelback like you drag Nickelback was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
3665520	3666400	You don't fuck with it.
3666400	3667600	Like you fuck with the nickel.
3667600	3668480	You get the back.
3668560	3674400	And they came back so hard on him and they tweeted back at him like leave us out of your
3674400	3677840	stuff and they went after him and then he apologized like immediately.
3677840	3679520	Look, I was I was going for unity.
3680720	3681120	Totally.
3681120	3683120	And I was like, wait, I thought you're supposed to be a tough guy.
3683120	3684320	You're a tough Republican.
3684320	3684960	Come on, man.
3684960	3685520	What the fuck?
3687360	3691520	That was a strange situation because I saw that video and I thought it was a really important
3691520	3695760	primer or alert to the concept of gerrymandering, which we don't talk enough about.
3695760	3696480	Totally.
3696480	3697760	But it was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3697760	3698240	I know.
3698240	3700720	I didn't retweet it because it was too.
3700720	3703840	I didn't want to deal with the I want to feel like some.
3703840	3704560	Come on, dad.
3704560	3707040	Let's go motorcycle riding in Malibu.
3707040	3709200	I mean, you can retweet some more of my stuff.
3709200	3711120	A woman groping Republicans sell out.
3711120	3715920	Also, as a Republican, he cut the first people he went after in California with the nurses
3715920	3716560	and the teachers.
3716560	3718800	Yeah, it's just another glory hat.
3718800	3722560	So it's it would it would have distracted from the message, but it was a good message.
3722560	3724160	Like we need to talk about gerrymandering.
3724160	3725040	Yeah, I agree.
3725040	3727280	And I love that Nickelback though came back at him.
3727920	3731200	To me, if that was Hoobastank, they just would have retweeted it.
3731200	3732560	So like, hey, fuck, we're in it.
3732560	3733120	We're in a tweet.
3733120	3733600	Good for us.
3733600	3736160	I said they should have gone to Hoobastank.
3737040	3738160	God fucking damn it.
3739600	3744000	Just to hear him say who was only in the app store.
3747360	3748720	Only in the app store.
3750080	3751440	Only in the app store.
3752320	3759920	What what Billy Bob and Arnold, like, just tweeted to each other.
3762000	3765360	I think it would go a little something like this.
3766560	3770080	Would you ask, do you ask Tom Petty?
3770080	3771280	What was in the app store?
3773280	3775760	I would ask him only what's in the app store.
3779280	3780560	That would be it.
3780640	3782560	But it just goes to like, remember that video?
3782560	3787520	Do you remember the video after Trump, like, Trump, Trump at the prayer breakfast was like,
3787520	3790720	well, and you should pray for Schwarzenegger's ratings.
3790720	3794160	And then Schwarzenegger released this video going like, hate Donald.
3794160	3795440	How about this?
3795440	3799360	And it was like, like, the swirling things that go through your head are like, well,
3799360	3802720	first of all, OK, so now we're just the WCW or whatever.
3802720	3806000	It's like, like, like, are these guys all with worse actors?
3806000	3808080	Like, the only thing missing is Mean Jean Green.
3808080	3810080	Like, like going between them.
3810080	3811600	Is that what they want?
3811600	3814640	But then the but then the other thing you go is like, God damn it.
3814640	3815920	Now I love Arnold again.
3815920	3823040	Because because it's like that, like charisma and empathy and just faces and heads on screens
3823040	3824400	is what we're so subject to.
3824400	3825600	And that is the whole problem.
3825600	3827280	We got to get away from that.
3827280	3829120	Like, he groped at your heartstrings.
3830320	3831600	He cornered them in an elevator.
3833600	3836240	Now he's paying for the baby that the two of you made.
3836240	3837360	No, there's too many.
3837360	3839840	That's all we felt like we were primates.
3839840	3843360	So we look at each other and sometimes the different people have different,
3843360	3845040	like, effects on us.
3845040	3847200	And we got to actually we got to grow.
3847200	3848480	We got to outgrow that.
3848480	3849200	I'm a writer.
3849200	3851920	I know all about like the need for heroes that we have.
3851920	3853760	But that's a biological impulse.
3853760	3854800	So is taking a shit.
3854800	3856080	We do that in a toilet.
3856080	3860880	When we elect our leaders, we need to have we need to overcome our urges.
3860880	3866080	And our urges are for like barrel chested leaders who are smarter and more capable
3866080	3868880	than us and John Wayne this and all this stuff.
3868880	3872800	And like the Democrats need to lead the charge, I think, on just being like,
3872800	3874640	this is not a human concept.
3874640	3876240	This is not an individualistic concept.
3876240	3878320	The idea of leading 300 million people.
3879200	3881680	And then by proxy, eight billion people.
3881680	3884320	I think Alec Baldwin should be our next person.
3884320	3886240	And he just goes in the face of my theory.
3886240	3886720	Well, I know.
3887760	3889360	It's the only way to get us the only way to go.
3889360	3892560	But it's almost like in the wake of our, you know, like, like,
3892560	3896560	those the old European countries that do still have like England.
3896560	3899040	It's like they have although they fucked up the Brexit.
3899040	3905200	They really did need to have we should have this popularity contest where we have a symbolic
3905840	3906480	leader of this.
3906480	3908400	You can just had so you must be British, right?
3909200	3910400	No, you say we already have it.
3910400	3911440	It's the Kardashians.
3912480	3916320	You seem that concerned that that if no one argues with me, we're going to revert to modern.
3916320	3917440	That's the motherfucker man.
3917440	3919200	Yeah, it's a bad impulse.
3919200	3920000	It's a bad impulse.
3920000	3922400	Like the idea of a monarchy being necessary.
3922560	3925280	Well, OK, of course, but not a monarch.
3925280	3926720	It wouldn't be a necessary monarchy.
3926720	3927920	It would be a symbolic one.
3927920	3929440	The king and the queen is.
3929440	3930880	Yeah, they don't do anything.
3930880	3931920	They are, though.
3931920	3936960	They satiate an urge people have to go visit a museum and look at a fancy hat and say,
3936960	3938000	oh, we're the best.
3938000	3938880	She's running shit.
3940000	3940960	There is this great.
3940960	3944560	But seriously, there's this great thing where they hide it and they're like,
3944560	3945760	the queen doesn't have any power.
3945760	3947520	She's got a ton of fucking power.
3947520	3950080	Parliament doesn't convene unless she speaks.
3950080	3951040	So don't trip.
3952800	3953760	They're still in.
3953760	3955360	They're still in some crazy ass mood.
3955360	3957280	I want to assure you guys, I was not tripping.
3958880	3960240	Nobody was tripping out there.
3960960	3962960	Everybody want to say the queen is not complicit.
3965200	3968000	I agree to the fact that we would be adding one.
3968000	3969760	It wouldn't be a powerful office.
3969760	3970640	We would be.
3971520	3973760	That's really what we're supposed to have already done.
3973760	3980160	We're supposed to let elected representatives and officials do some of the grunt work and
3980160	3981840	we're supposed to take care of each other.
3981840	3985440	We're in this position now because we keep trying to hire people to take us out of this
3985440	3990080	position in a true American sense where we're like, I want to send my congressman up there
3990080	3991440	to get you health care.
3991440	3995040	When the reality of the situation is how do we been together?
3995040	3996560	None of this shit would happen in the first place.
3996560	3998160	It's not Democrats or Republicans.
3998160	3999040	This shit is on.
3999040	3999680	That's true.
4001040	4003920	When did this become like, go ahead and applaud.
4003920	4005520	Yeah, that's true.
4005520	4010400	But it's also, isn't it like an American tradition and right?
4010400	4012640	The idea that that's fucking grunt work.
4012640	4013840	It's civil service.
4013840	4015840	Like go represent me on Capitol Hill.
4015840	4017360	I have potatoes to farm.
4017360	4018560	But they really want to do it.
4018560	4022560	When you talk to a congressman, when you talk to a politician, they actually really do give a fuck.
4023600	4030240	Not all of them do, but a ton of them are like, hey, man, my calling was building neighborhoods.
4030240	4032720	My calling was figuring out a way not to have.
4032720	4039120	We need to put like maybe if each of us put 10% more of our day into the being represented
4039120	4040560	part of representation.
4040560	4046720	I'm saying you could actually take your power back if you paid attention to what was going on.
4046720	4047920	Just one block over.
4048480	4049600	Just one block over.
4049600	4052400	Don't have to become an alderman.
4052400	4054160	Don't have to become the mayor of your city.
4054160	4056640	But take the block to the left or take the block to the right.
4056640	4059760	And if everybody on a block did that shit,
4059760	4063280	we'd be way better off than what we needed our elected representatives to do.
4063280	4065120	It probably is a good time to bring up this thing.
4066400	4067840	You guys heard of this indivisible thing.
4067840	4069520	We talked about it, I think, last week maybe.
4069520	4071360	But there's this thing online.
4071360	4074080	It's kind of a guidebook for what we're talking about.
4074080	4075200	It includes that.
4077040	4080640	The sad thing is that it's sort of taken a lot of pages from the Tea Party's playbook
4080640	4085600	because it's observing the fact that a small but passionate group of people
4085600	4088720	that were filled with hatred and had their heart in the wrong place
4088720	4092240	still managed political efficacy just by working on a local level.
4092240	4094720	They showed up in droves at town halls and did all this shit.
4094720	4096960	So you can tell this indivisible playbook.
4096960	4100400	And if you just Google it, there's an audio book that's an hour long
4100400	4101760	that reads through it in your car.
4102480	4103680	Don't listen to this episode.
4103680	4106160	I give you permission to spend that hour listening to this thing.
4106160	4106720	It just kind of-
4106720	4107600	Wait, wait, wait.
4107600	4110320	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4110320	4111440	Don't listen to the second hour.
4111440	4114000	All right, all right, all right, all right.
4114000	4116000	But it basically just says that.
4116320	4123440	I mean, it's like if there's not 20 people within a certain block or radius of you
4123440	4128000	that have started something, start it.
4128000	4128880	And here's how you started.
4128880	4132720	We know that's how gentrification worked was that people called the cops
4132720	4134800	once they moved to neighborhoods that had crime.
4134800	4138640	People called their friends and had a visible presence in that neighborhood.
4138640	4140960	So we know that it works for real estate prices.
4140960	4144480	The same thing would work for each one of us trying to take care of one another.
4144480	4146160	It works for schools too.
4146160	4149280	Both of us sent our kids to public schools here.
4149280	4152000	And one of the reasons why the public schools in our neighborhood are good
4152000	4153840	is because the parents are fucking involved.
4153840	4154800	It's that simple.
4154800	4155520	That's it.
4155520	4156560	That's the end of it.
4156560	4158400	Teachers can only do so much.
4158400	4161040	We have the same shitty classrooms and the shitty chairs
4161040	4163040	that every other school has in the city,
4163040	4167360	but our parents go out in the community and raise a bunch of fucking money
4167360	4168320	and put it in and be like,
4168320	4170080	we don't want the music teacher one day a week.
4170080	4174320	Which is classic, but a great role model to begin with.
4175280	4176000	It is.
4176000	4176480	It is.
4176480	4178880	They're going to argue the charter, because people say charter schools.
4178880	4179680	Well, this is a charter.
4179680	4180320	This is not a charter.
4180320	4181680	This is public.
4181680	4182000	Okay.
4182000	4185120	It's a wonderful thing that we can all bring the most money to the picnic
4185120	4188080	and then look over at the other side of the park and see motherfucker starve.
4188080	4188640	True, but-
4188640	4189680	I'm not knocking that.
4189680	4192000	What we should have been doing was passing legislation
4192000	4194000	so that all California schools got picked up.
4194000	4194720	Completely agree.
4194720	4195360	Completely agree.
4195360	4196320	Completely agree.
4196320	4197360	Or tax weed.
4197360	4198560	And we know that.
4198560	4199520	That's the thing.
4199520	4200240	We know it.
4200240	4201760	People aren't fucking with us.
4201760	4202960	Fuck a Bannon.
4202960	4204800	Bannon can't fuck you up now, really.
4204800	4207760	The truth is, we kind of let ourselves down.
4207760	4208800	They can't, because they are-
4208800	4209920	I think Bannon could really fuck it up.
4209920	4210880	Here's the bottom line.
4210880	4213440	You know that churches, maybe you don't.
4213440	4216160	But churches are already coming up with safe houses.
4216160	4218480	Maybe we got to go back to the days of abolition
4218480	4219840	where the Quakers had to hide the slaves,
4219840	4222160	and we got to hide people who have come to this country.
4222160	4223520	I don't say illegal.
4223520	4226480	Maybe that's what we got to do, but goddamn, that's what we're about to do.
4226480	4228480	You asked about the silver lining, and just real quick,
4228480	4230080	the silver lining is that you all know how to-
4230080	4230880	Go real slow.
4230880	4232400	You're getting there.
4232400	4234640	You know how to start this fight.
4234640	4235360	You know how.
4235360	4236640	That's the silver lining.
4236640	4239840	The silver lining is, instead of your $4 intelligentsia,
4239840	4242320	now you're going to these motherfucking meetings,
4242320	4245200	kicking $3 down to make some posters and showing up.
4245200	4246480	That's the silver lining.
4246480	4250560	You get to become you now more than you've ever been you before.
4255840	4257680	That's the silver lining.
4257680	4260000	Now, a lot of you are moved by that,
4260000	4261920	and I don't want to pull the Wizards curtain down,
4262720	4265600	but Brandon now pitched 1980's Manimal.
4265600	4267280	Let me tell you something about this film.
4270640	4274480	You guys said to Hollywood, we want men, but we want animals.
4275440	4277120	We want to be able to find it.
4277840	4278560	You understand?
4278560	4280640	So don't confuse us with a name.
4280640	4281520	Don't be tripping.
4281520	4283440	We want it to be simple.
4283440	4284000	Manimal.
4288000	4288960	The man is an animal.
4288960	4290560	He is just an effective speaker.
4290560	4292480	That does not mean he's not telling the truth.
4292480	4294560	All of his ideas are bullshit.
4294560	4297040	Everything he says ends in a applause break.
4297040	4298000	This is what I want.
4298000	4299520	No, Brandon.
4300320	4302080	This is what I'm looking for, Dan.
4302080	4304400	This is all I want.
4304400	4306160	This is the voice you take.
4306160	4307120	This is the one.
4307120	4309440	Why can't Brandon be your voice coach?
4309440	4311840	Are you, I have a question to you,
4311840	4313920	and this, I don't want to get too inside the business,
4313920	4316640	but are you open to having your whole life ADR'd?
4316640	4320000	You could have somebody just loop your entire lives.
4320000	4322800	Stand up in front and have Brandon do your ADR.
4322800	4323520	Just hit him.
4323520	4324240	Yeah, get up here.
4324240	4325760	He doesn't even need a mic, but okay.
4326480	4327840	That's just a prop, but okay.
4327840	4328560	Oh, it's a prop.
4328560	4329040	Okay.
4329040	4329840	Just give it to him.
4336560	4337040	Oh.
4343920	4346160	This is working.
4346160	4354400	If I speak slowly, my voice will be low.
4356480	4358160	Now I want to see, can we compound it?
4358160	4359840	Here, Brandon, you use this mic.
4371680	4372560	Oh, God.
4373520	4376480	Another day is a 19-year-old.
4383200	4390720	I want to get some, but I'm not sure this is the hair for me.
4395040	4398880	How, how, how, hey, Rob, how was her one-woman show?
4398880	4402640	It was, uh, it was pretty good.
4403840	4405280	So good.
4406240	4407680	So pretty good.
4408720	4409680	You like, you're not?
4409680	4410640	Pretty good.
4410640	4411600	Oh, I love it.
4411600	4413040	It's not too messy, Rob.
4413040	4414800	I'm thinking maybe I should skip it.
4414800	4415280	Okay.
4418560	4419120	Look at that.
4419120	4420240	That's a good circle.
4420240	4420800	Told you.
4420800	4421680	I can deal with that.
4422240	4427200	Every, everything he does ends in an applause break.
4427200	4427760	Yeah.
4427760	4430000	Wait, was it the, was it the monitors or something?
4430000	4434320	It just, your voice sounded not altered by the thing.
4434320	4435440	Was it like going lower?
4435440	4438160	I always carry a little bit of helium just for these moments.
4438160	4439200	You like offset it?
4439200	4440400	In the jacket rocket.
4441680	4443280	Just to keep you honest, don't get it.
4444560	4445280	All right.
4445280	4445680	Look.
4445680	4446720	That felt good.
4446720	4448480	That felt, that, that looked good.
4448480	4448880	Right?
4448880	4449440	Felt real good.
4449440	4450000	I looked good, right?
4450000	4451440	You listened to what I was saying, right?
4451440	4452480	You looked great.
4452480	4455440	A, uh, a friend of mine, uh, uh.
4455440	4456160	Was it me?
4456160	4460320	His son, uh, no, younger lad.
4460320	4464160	Don't really know his son's age, but he's like, he's, he's pretty young.
4464160	4468240	And, uh, like way, way, way before puberty, just like a little kid.
4469040	4474640	And, uh, he, uh, he was on the computer and he was like, the dad was like,
4474640	4476080	what are you, what are you doing over there?
4476080	4477600	And he's like, nothing, just playing this game.
4477600	4478800	And he's like, okay.
4478800	4481360	Then he kind of was wondering about it because he was extra quiet.
4482320	4485280	And he took him and went and hung out with him or whatever.
4485280	4489440	And then he later, he came back and he looked at the history, the history,
4489440	4490880	which is, this is a new thing now.
4490880	4495200	Like the way I learned about sex was like weird hustler pages in the,
4495200	4497760	in the mud next to a printing factory.
4497760	4502240	And I don't think people talking about how the internet is like, like, oh, it's a,
4502240	4503280	you know, it's all this awful thing.
4503280	4506560	Well, it's one pipe of everything coming into your home.
4506560	4509760	I think, you know, it's like, again, I was by a storm drain,
4509760	4514880	like crouched over a crawdad river, you know, like, I don't know how healthy that was.
4514960	4518960	I don't know if my girlfriends are happy that that's how I saw my first naked lady.
4520560	4525520	But, you know, and YouTube's like very, like, the kid, he was just saying
4525520	4530480	that he went through the search history and the kid, the kid had searched for the word.
4531440	4535520	Vachina, V-U-C-H-I-N-A.
4537200	4542560	Which we're not even talking to Vachina anymore as a country, a big issue.
4542560	4544000	And then also sexy ass.
4545520	4551040	Yeah, I got to look that up and Rob Shroff's picture came up on that one.
4551040	4556240	That is a sexy ass, a very sexy ass we know from just watching that bit.
4556240	4560160	You guys have kids, are you at that threshold or they're like Googling stuff?
4560160	4562400	They're not because I had two daughters, so I'm like,
4562400	4565920	fucking, they'll be 19 before they're, I mean, they're, they're kind of,
4565920	4567440	they scoot together as a stereotype.
4567440	4568240	Oh, geez.
4569680	4570800	You guys are so quiet.
4570800	4573920	I like to have room turn on a dime.
4575280	4575920	No, I like that.
4575920	4579280	I mean, look, they're, I don't think we'll have an issue with that with,
4579280	4581520	with them, but they're, it is crazy.
4581520	4582560	Just having grown up.
4582560	4584080	Wait, what do you mean you want to have an issue?
4584080	4589760	I mean, I don't think, I don't, I know my kid, I may, but I mean, for right now,
4589760	4595040	they both kind of, I don't know, the older one who's almost 12, kind of like skews younger.
4595600	4597600	We want, we've got a little more time before we can,
4598240	4599680	there'll be a point in time where she'll just.
4599680	4601280	So Paris, he'll take mine and see it.
4601280	4605120	No, there'll be a point, there'll be a point in time where she'll just
4605120	4608160	completely stop communicating with us and then we just won't have to deal with it.
4610480	4613440	My son tonight was like, he's eight.
4613440	4613680	All right.
4613680	4617840	He just turned eight and he wanted to see the karate kid because he's been doing
4617840	4619200	a lot of Taekwondo.
4619200	4625120	And I was like, well, let me, I have to also weirdest scene ever to show him the Pat Morita.
4625120	4629760	There's no, if a cop showed up at Pat Morita's house when he was drunk,
4630480	4635600	every single thing that he said, like real explanation of stuff that he was doing.
4635600	4636560	Would make him sound like a pedophile.
4636560	4637760	Would dig him into a deeper hole.
4637760	4638240	He's drunk.
4638240	4640960	What? I was just drunk with this 16 year old kid.
4640960	4641200	What?
4641200	4642880	I just was having him wash my cars.
4642880	4645680	What? I just gifted him a silk robe.
4645680	4646720	What's the problem there?
4646720	4647040	What?
4647040	4649920	I just took him on a boat and let him punch me in the stomach.
4649920	4654800	I put on a chest protector and I let him put, cops, what are the problem here?
4654800	4656320	So you wanted to show your son that.
4656320	4658560	I just gave him a car for nothing in return.
4658560	4659040	That's it, sure.
4659360	4660960	No strings attached there.
4660960	4663440	But no, I was like, I haven't seen the movie in a really long time.
4663440	4666400	And I was like, I have to watch this with you.
4666400	4669920	And in case something's in it that I want to explain to you,
4669920	4671840	like I was trying to be there for the whole movie.
4671840	4674560	And I was, and there were, dropped an S bomb.
4674560	4676720	They dropped a couple of other things.
4676720	4680320	But the thing that he wanted me to leave the room on is when they started making out.
4680320	4681680	He was like, dad, get out of here.
4681680	4683760	And I was like, do you need to see this alone?
4686480	4688720	Did he not think you were ready to see that?
4688720	4694800	I know that mommy and I don't kiss anymore, but why are you?
4696240	4698320	Our favorite moment in the movie.
4698320	4701600	We've done stand up on this and I know we're not going to bust into a bit,
4701600	4704160	but the best line, and I saw it tonight.
4704160	4708560	The best line is he makes up Ralph Maci, the karate kid makes up.
4708560	4709920	Sorry, spoiler alert.
4709920	4714160	Makes up with Elizabeth Shoe at the arcade, right?
4714160	4714960	And they're hugging.
4714960	4716000	They've just kissed.
4716000	4716960	Dad, get out of here.
4716960	4717440	I stayed.
4718960	4721760	And he goes, so I guess you've heard about,
4721760	4724080	you know about the big karate tournament tomorrow.
4724080	4725520	And she's like, who doesn't?
4726320	4727600	We're like, yeah.
4728640	4734640	Who in Southern California doesn't know about this obscure high school karate tournament?
4734640	4735760	It's also how they met.
4735760	4740240	He met her on a beach by trying karate on her.
4740240	4744880	I go out on a Saturday and there's like wet wall to wall traffic on the 405.
4744880	4748000	I'm like, what bizarre junior high school jiu jitsu.
4749200	4753440	Exhibition is happening down in Long Beach to cause this much of a stack up here.
4753440	4757760	Exploitation movies have to be supposed to skateboard a little bigger.
4759440	4761200	Otherwise, they'd have to spend 20 minutes going.
4761200	4765040	Once upon a time, the society didn't think karate was important.
4766720	4770160	They skip right to the in a world where karate is important.
4771200	4775040	But I will say, Elizabeth Shoe, I think your kid has probably experienced.
4775040	4776480	She's empirically.
4776480	4777200	Oh, my God.
4777360	4778400	She's memorizingly beautiful.
4778400	4784240	Oh, we got to do a scene with her in CSI or whatever we did with her.
4784240	4785520	She was still beautiful.
4787040	4792400	Yeah, I that that movie like like like that that character coming on screen.
4792400	4795840	It's like I that would that launched a thousand chips.
4795840	4796480	I mean, it did.
4796480	4798720	It was like it wasn't Ralph Macchio we were enamored with.
4799520	4802880	We identified with him and waxed on and waxed off with him.
4802880	4804720	But waxed off to her.
4804720	4806000	You waxed off to her.
4806640	4809680	She was like like like that was the 80s and it's fucking most perfect.
4809680	4812880	It was like like with the with the with the sweaters and the little barrettes.
4813920	4814240	All right.
4814800	4815440	Perfect.
4815440	4816000	Perfect.
4816000	4817120	You watch that movie again, though.
4817120	4820720	It's like she she plays like 25 and he plays 14.
4820720	4824640	Meanwhile, he was 22 when they did it and everyone was like in high school.
4825600	4831040	But what do you so so but this is the thing because this dad that told me about that story.
4831040	4833680	He's like, okay, how do you search history for China?
4834320	4836720	Like like and I've heard his parents over and over and over again.
4836720	4839440	All the stories, the standups and things are telling stories like,
4839440	4842160	oh, they're walking on their kids on YouTube and they're they've googled
4842160	4846560	things and they're looking at things and it's time to it's like this ambush
4846560	4852080	where it's time to have this weird talk with your kid about and all of these stories end
4852080	4857840	with this sort of like and so I said this and that and sometimes the parents is the
4857840	4862320	hero of the story because they said something so fucking weirdly like navigating all these
4862320	4864160	highway cones, but that's as good as it gets it.
4864160	4869360	It's like there is no healthy like we have all of these like toxic ways.
4869360	4872480	We have all these ways that we worry about our kids learning about sex.
4872480	4874880	We don't have any ways that we look forward to it.
4875680	4876960	We have demonized it.
4876960	4878160	I want it to be awkward.
4878160	4879920	I want it to be as awkward as possible.
4879920	4881040	Like as standups.
4881040	4885520	I think in life or just as people who look at life and try and create you want the most
4885520	4888800	if it goes smoothly, if it goes really smoothly, that's great.
4888800	4890240	Then then your life is good.
4890560	4894480	Don't you think we need as a society to adopt some kind of standard?
4894480	4900480	I think we have the most fucked up attitudes towards death and loss and like we're all
4900480	4900960	fucked up.
4900960	4902400	That's all DIY every step of the way.
4902400	4905120	Wiping your ass showering like yeah, I didn't really.
4905120	4906320	Everyone should have a bidet.
4906320	4910480	I mean, but that's starting at another point, but like controversial.
4910480	4911360	Right guys.
4911360	4912800	I'll lay that shit down.
4912800	4915280	Hey, but I mean, I just think like we have a lot.
4915280	4918640	There are a lot of things that need to be changed, but definitely the sex talk and the way we look
4918640	4921520	at it, there's a, there are puritanical underpinnings.
4921520	4923680	And when we grew up in st. Louis, I don't know if you felt it too.
4923680	4926160	I felt like it was more constricted to the Bible.
4926160	4932640	Like we go and spend time in cities like Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, the overall
4932640	4934160	attitude of the people who live there.
4934160	4939360	It's like way, way, way fucking more open about everything where we grew up in st.
4939360	4939680	Louis.
4939680	4944240	I feel like the puritanical underpinnings of sex made it something that is wrong
4944240	4945280	and you should not do.
4945280	4947840	And so you're at least not talk about it.
4947840	4948320	Don't talk about it.
4948320	4952960	So if you were like the only black dude, it was rough because everybody would experiment
4952960	4954240	with you puritanically.
4954240	4955120	That's right.
4955120	4956560	It's just taboo.
4956560	4958240	So fucking taboo.
4960480	4963520	Oh, I miss the racism of sex.
4965840	4967760	This is the good side of prohibition.
4967760	4970400	Yeah, that's everybody still got drunk.
4970400	4974160	We've had, I seem to remember we've had, we've had women up on this stage who have
4974160	4978880	recounted a golden age of the podcast.
4978880	4982480	I remember, I remember a young lady coming up and telling the story of how when she was
4982480	4986880	in high school, she was sort of, you know, it's a classic story in like the, the, the
4986880	4992160	movies that we don't, she was branded a slut essentially.
4992160	5000800	Like, like, because she, like, she was the participant in early experiences of other
5000800	5004240	shitheads that then punished her for that.
5004240	5007840	It's like, it wasn't like she went out with a sandwich board and said, let's do this.
5007840	5013360	Um, you know, she simply was the person that, or maybe she fucking enjoyed it.
5013360	5017360	Uh, did not, she came on the show and said, oh, she did not enjoy it.
5017360	5018480	No, she, she enjoyed it.
5018480	5018640	Fine.
5018640	5020320	She did not enjoy the slut label.
5020320	5024000	I'm not saying she, yeah, maybe she just enjoyed the experiences themselves and she
5024000	5025280	should be allowed to.
5025280	5025600	Yes.
5025600	5027680	I mean, you're not taking a brave stance there.
5027680	5029040	We're all, no, Jesus.
5029360	5031360	Wait, wait, wait.
5031360	5034320	Women should enjoy sex, right?
5034320	5035840	Am I right, ladies?
5036880	5037600	Guys?
5037600	5038880	No, I'm sorry.
5038880	5041680	I jumped off the ship on this one.
5041680	5044080	They should be encouraged to enjoy sex.
5044080	5046640	My wife should be encouraged to enjoy sex.
5048240	5055440	I'm saying that we, we all end up, uh, dealing with young people's sexuality, uh, over and
5055440	5058160	over again, because it does become a civic matter.
5058160	5059840	It becomes a legal matter.
5059840	5064400	If some kid didn't understand the difference between consent and not, and that's that,
5064400	5066640	that becomes a criminal legal matter.
5066640	5068480	It becomes all of our problem.
5068480	5073440	So we're still living in this weird time when we're like, oh, let my kid learn about sex.
5073440	5077920	Like, however they want and like, whoa, who would, who would want some Obama
5078800	5081120	panel telling you how to tell your kids about sex.
5081120	5083760	But there's a tube coming into everyone's home.
5083760	5086240	All of our kids are learning now from the same
5086960	5091200	fucking aluminum hinged device that Steve Jobs designed.
5091200	5094400	Like it's, it couldn't be more Orwellian the way our kids are learning about sex.
5094400	5097680	Except for one thing, they're not learning anything healthy.
5097680	5102240	No, no, they're not learning that they're not, they're not actually being told at any point
5102240	5105360	the thing that they're most interested in from age three forward, which is
5106000	5107920	where does this go and what's this for?
5107920	5109440	And what the fuck is, am I supposed to do?
5109440	5110240	And why does it feel good?
5111040	5114800	But also they're not learning about intimacy either because there's none of that in any of
5114800	5116000	the videos that are online.
5116000	5117680	We get the same shit though.
5117680	5119440	They're doing it to the adults as well.
5119440	5121280	You know, they sort of took it from all of us.
5121280	5123760	So it's hard for us to like, give it back to our kids.
5123760	5125360	Because we're all, but we're all fucked up too.
5125360	5127920	Like the way I, if I had a kid, I'd be like,
5127920	5130000	listen, what are you doing googling that?
5130000	5131840	Go out by the river and hunt crawdad.
5135040	5136480	Find a hustler dumpster.
5136480	5139040	I think there's a laptop laying by the crick over there.
5139040	5140240	You can get on that.
5140240	5144560	There's this thing that's like, are you looking at boobs and it's not attached to commercialism?
5144560	5145040	Stop it.
5145840	5149040	But if it's attached to commercialism and you're about to buy something,
5149040	5150640	then fuck yes, look at those boobs.
5150640	5151600	It's called Victoria's Secret.
5151600	5155120	Yeah, you should be being like, instrumentally, like, yeah,
5155120	5157920	like teased by Happy Meals about Hermione Granger.
5157920	5162480	Like you should be doing this on the schedule that Disney deems it appropriate.
5162480	5167200	You know, the slit in Eliza's skirt during Let It Go or whatever.
5167200	5168320	It should be just high enough.
5168800	5170400	It's like, it's up to Pixar.
5170400	5171200	It's up to Disney.
5171200	5174640	It's like when your kid gets his first hard on.
5174640	5175520	Yeah.
5175520	5178000	By the way, Eliza, not a character in Frozen.
5178000	5182800	Uh, just thought I just thought I'd
5182800	5183920	But I know she lets it go.
5183920	5185440	She doesn't know that.
5185440	5187120	Right up that fucking slit.
5187120	5189760	Oh, why did I turn to the deck?
5190960	5192880	If I had a kid, I know all their names.
5192880	5194160	You should know and you should.
5194160	5195680	Well, Aluja, Elise.
5195680	5196240	What are they?
5196240	5198080	It's Anna and Elsa, but what happened?
5198080	5199360	Anna and Elsa, right.
5199360	5201200	Sorry that I know that shit, yeah.
5202560	5204800	She should have made mystical pajamas.
5204800	5205760	She should.
5205760	5212240	If she's letting it go, she should have made comfortable flannel pajamas in my world.
5212240	5213040	Yeah, they show up.
5213040	5217680	Letting it go to me is like putting on, yeah, like, like super comfortable,
5217680	5222880	like not just, I'm just going to eat shit now and not care if I'm letting it go.
5222880	5223680	I'm away.
5223680	5225680	How do you guys filter, though, for your kids?
5225680	5227840	Like, how do you make sure they don't see any of that shit?
5227840	5230640	I mean, you got to be on top of what they're doing.
5230640	5232000	You got to watch what they're watching.
5232000	5234240	My kids got into a really interesting discussion
5234240	5236000	because they're super into Hamilton.
5236000	5237440	They're fucking so into Hamilton.
5237440	5240240	And I love that they're into Hamilton because it's amazing.
5240240	5242640	And it is like, we just bought the record.
5242640	5243200	Wait a second.
5243200	5244400	Hamilton is amazing.
5244400	5245680	I'll take the stand bitches.
5245680	5246240	Wow.
5247520	5249840	No, it is like, it's...
5250880	5252720	I don't understand trap music, though.
5252720	5253200	Yeah, I know.
5254240	5255760	I love Hamilton.
5255760	5256560	Hate rap.
5257920	5258480	Hate rap.
5258480	5260800	I mean, can we put an end to that?
5260800	5262320	It's all about the duel.
5265520	5266640	It's about history.
5266640	5268400	No, but they do love it.
5268400	5271120	But the soundtrack and some of the later songs,
5271120	5273360	they'll drop a motherfucker and they'll drop a...
5273360	5275040	They drop some bad language.
5275040	5280560	And my kids were telling me yesterday that they love that we don't make a big deal
5280640	5283200	out of the fact that we'll let them listen to that
5283200	5285040	without being like, you shouldn't do...
5285040	5287680	Because we aren't on top of them for that.
5287680	5289280	You say, it's because we cool, motherfucker.
5289280	5289760	That's right.
5291680	5293360	Damn, bitches.
5293360	5294400	I saw you drop your voice.
5294400	5294800	That's it.
5294800	5295840	Cool, motherfucker.
5295840	5296320	That's it.
5296320	5297600	How would I say it if I were you?
5297600	5298800	$150.
5301440	5302480	Sounded like Carson there.
5302480	5302960	I know.
5302960	5303840	I know.
5303840	5306000	I would love it if he was like, thank you very much.
5306000	5307200	That's very cool.
5307200	5310240	But they kind of had this weird discussion where they were like,
5310960	5315440	my son was like that today when we heard some of the bad language.
5315440	5317440	And he was like, I was like, why do you want me out of the room?
5317440	5318640	He's like, because you're going to hear something bad
5318640	5320000	and you're going to make me turn it off.
5320000	5321520	I was like, I'm not going to make you turn it off.
5321520	5322560	But I do.
5322560	5325360	If we talk about it, we can talk about that word
5325360	5328000	and when it's appropriate to use it, when it's not.
5328000	5329520	I'm like, you could actually...
5329520	5332160	Some kid, some fucking douchebag kid.
5332160	5334320	And there are douchebag kids all over.
5334320	5335520	These three fucking kids across...
5335520	5337600	All right, so there are these douchebag kids in our neighborhood.
5337600	5342720	And one of them got mad at my son for some bullshit thing
5342720	5344720	and yelled at him really loud.
5344720	5347360	And my son came in the house and I didn't think he knew.
5347360	5350080	He was like, that motherfucking piece of shit.
5352480	5356640	And I was like, I was so proud in a weird way that he knew that.
5356640	5358160	Well, here's why I was proud.
5358160	5360160	I was like, oh my God, he knows these words
5360160	5362640	and he knows not to throw them around at school
5362640	5365040	or in moments where it's not appropriate.
5365040	5367600	And this was like, he was reaching for the worst thing
5367600	5370000	he could say about someone and then he had these in his cachet.
5370000	5371200	And I was like, that's cool.
5371200	5372800	I thought that was very cool.
5372800	5374320	So there is a way...
5374320	5376160	I was like, yeah, bitch, he does suck.
5378240	5379600	But that's the way to like...
5379600	5383040	I guess that's this kind of example of allowing them
5383040	5384960	a little bit of control in this scenario.
5385680	5387600	Because I think going the other way where you're trying...
5387600	5389520	Parenting, you're going to do 80% wrong.
5389520	5392160	You're going to feel like you're doing 80% of what you're doing wrong,
5392160	5393760	even though you're trying to do everything right.
5393840	5397280	Yeah, I would never be really hypocritical of me to say...
5398240	5400000	Some of it shouldn't be upon us.
5400000	5402000	We have an alphabet.
5402000	5403360	We have insulin.
5403360	5404240	We have...
5404240	5406560	We have an alphabet.
5407760	5409520	We have a food word.
5409520	5410480	There's a stand.
5411200	5414480	We've got this alphabet, people.
5414480	5419360	We have an accepted civic, like externalized protocol
5419360	5421680	that we go like, this is how much body fat
5421680	5423200	you're kind of supposed to have.
5423840	5425760	Just like the alphabets.
5426720	5429120	What a fucking dumb piece of shit.
5430400	5432240	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
5432240	5433680	You can turn off my microphone.
5433680	5435440	I just fucking hate you.
5435440	5437040	I know, I know, I know.
5437040	5438320	I hate me too.
5439040	5441040	I get excited to share something, and then I just like...
5441040	5442400	I know, I know, I know.
5442400	5442960	And then I just...
5442960	5444240	It's your voice, and I just like...
5444240	5445200	I know, I know.
5445200	5447200	This is why he's going.
5447200	5447680	This is why...
5447680	5448240	It's just lower.
5448240	5449360	I just want it to be lower.
5449360	5450800	I know, I know, I know.
5451360	5451840	He gets it.
5451840	5453840	When my voice is low, it erupts me.
5453840	5454720	I'm like, yes, sir.
5456080	5457040	I understand.
5459600	5462720	Something about the length of the larynx, I don't know.
5466720	5467680	Anyways, whatever.
5467680	5470320	Teach your kids how to fuck right, I guess is my theme.
5470320	5471040	I don't know.
5471040	5472240	Also your album.
5472240	5473120	Also your album.
5473120	5474400	Teach your kids how to fuck right.
5476960	5478400	Teach your kids to fuck right.
5478400	5481600	That was my favorite Crosby, Stills, and Ash song.
5481600	5483120	Didn't Mr. T do that?
5483120	5483600	Teach.
5483600	5484160	Did Mr. T...
5484160	5487680	Teach your kids to fuck right.
5487680	5488480	Teach them right.
5489120	5490720	Teach them how to fuck right.
5491440	5492240	Teach them right.
5492800	5494480	Teach them how to fuck right.
5495120	5496000	Teach them right.
5496000	5496960	Teach them right.
5496960	5498400	Teach them how to fuck right.
5498400	5501280	Is that the elder barge version of that song?
5501280	5502000	Mr. T...
5502000	5503520	My girlfriend, by the way.
5503520	5504000	Cody.
5505680	5506320	Yeah, thank you.
5508960	5509440	She...
5509440	5511680	We were talking about this on the way home from that party,
5511680	5514160	and our listener, our friends, talked about the YouTube thing.
5514160	5518560	She learned sex from a children's book that probably...
5518560	5520800	Maybe hippies have, and maybe not everybody has,
5520800	5522400	but if anybody in the audience remembers this book.
5522400	5523760	Richard Scarry.
5523760	5524160	It was...
5527120	5529200	Cars, planes, and running a train.
5529200	5529700	Yeah.
5531200	5533200	Oh, snap.
5535200	5535520	Oh, boy.
5538560	5543760	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5543760	5544240	Come on.
5545360	5546320	Come on in here, honey.
5546320	5547040	It's time...
5547040	5547920	Thank you.
5547920	5548960	Come on in here, honey.
5548960	5550240	It's time to find Goldberg.
5552480	5552960	Goldberg?
5552960	5553520	Goldberg.
5553520	5554480	Goldberg.
5554480	5555120	Goldberg is...
5555120	5556080	Did you say Goldberg?
5556080	5557120	Goldberg is...
5557120	5559200	That's what the Trump administration is going to do.
5560800	5562400	Root out every Goldberg.
5562400	5563840	Time to find Goldberg.
5563840	5567920	I broke the drawer on this, on the podium.
5567920	5569600	The fictitious drawer.
5569600	5570240	I tried to...
5570880	5574000	I tried to situate myself when I was leaning back too far,
5574000	5577040	and I pulled this drawer front of me.
5577040	5578720	Rob, that's what you do to every situation.
5578720	5580320	You break the door on that shit.
5580320	5580800	Yeah.
5580800	5581600	The drawer on that shit.
5581600	5582000	I'm sorry.
5583120	5583840	I'm sorry.
5584640	5585120	Don't worry.
5585120	5586640	It's just the look of the drawer.
5589280	5590960	Just go into applause.
5590960	5591840	He's used to it.
5591840	5593280	Just go into applause.
5593280	5595680	Clap, he needs it, or else he'll keep going.
5596640	5598960	Applause is how he knows when to stop, all right?
5598960	5599840	So just...
5599840	5601120	It's just the look of the drawer.
5603680	5606000	I'm glad that happened after the plane's changed
5606000	5606880	and running a train deck.
5606880	5607600	Yeah, it was good.
5607600	5609520	It's like, come on, that's just a dot.
5609520	5609760	Can I...
5609760	5610400	Okay, good.
5610400	5611280	Cuts both ways.
5611280	5611760	Good.
5614640	5616320	Listen, it's about volume.
5616320	5617200	Shots on gold.
5618000	5619040	Shots on gold.
5620800	5622800	You make none of the shots you don't take?
5622800	5625920	My ex-wife, Erin McGathey, had the best zigger.
5626720	5629360	I did a joke, and I can't remember what it was,
5629360	5631200	but it fell in silence.
5631200	5633040	And I said, they can't all be gems.
5633040	5635600	And then a couple seconds passed, and she said,
5635600	5636880	couldn't some of them be gems?
5644400	5645600	So I do Forster.
5645600	5645840	Yeah.
5647440	5648800	Rightfully so.
5648800	5652000	There's a gem for you.
5653760	5655280	Serve those papers.
5658400	5658880	All right.
5658880	5661040	Vagina, Rob's voice coaching.
5661040	5662080	Skin conductance.
5662720	5666640	My chiropractor tells me to take these re-evals,
5666640	5670880	and he makes me put my finger in this thing.
5670880	5672880	And I looked at the computer while he was out of the room,
5672880	5675680	and it's measuring heart rate, skin temperature,
5675680	5677040	and skin conductance.
5677040	5678080	Isn't that an E-meter?
5680080	5682480	Is my back a Scientologist?
5682480	5686720	Did he make you confess all your sins into a chafing dish?
5688160	5690960	I mean, he always shows me the next week,
5690960	5693760	he goes like, oh, here's your re-eval based on that.
5693760	5697600	And then if it's within things that look really healthy,
5697600	5700240	he'll go, by the way, have you smoked pot recently?
5700240	5701520	The answer's always yes.
5701520	5702320	Of course.
5702320	5703840	And then I'll be like, I thought so.
5703840	5705360	Pot really screws up the numbers.
5705360	5706800	And it's like, this is a religion.
5706800	5707600	You're just a back.
5707600	5707840	You're making up a number.
5707840	5708800	Just crack my back.
5708800	5711680	I think you should give it another year,
5711680	5713680	and then not go to him anymore.
5713680	5715440	He makes my back feel better.
5715440	5716320	Yeah.
5716320	5717920	But all chiropractors.
5717920	5720080	Yeah, he makes your back feel better, Dan.
5720080	5723040	They have to have this religion attached to their back cracking.
5723040	5724000	Yeah, I feel like you're-
5724000	5725840	Did you know your back is part of the moon?
5727280	5730240	Because otherwise, they'd just be like a fucking back doctor,
5730240	5731760	and they don't want that.
5731760	5733680	They want to be part of everything.
5733680	5736240	Yeah, I feel like he's really overstepping his bounds.
5736800	5738560	Has he asked you to pee in a cup at all?
5738560	5739360	No.
5739360	5741440	Well, now, how often do you go to the chiropractor?
5741520	5742080	Once a week.
5742080	5742640	Once a week.
5742640	5743680	That's too much.
5743680	5744640	Yeah, you got to go.
5744640	5745840	You got to spread it out.
5745840	5750080	That's- no, the chiropractor is where you go and shit's really bad,
5750080	5751680	and then you go to the guy, and then you get a fit.
5751680	5754400	Yeah, I got a real bad bag.
5755840	5756240	All right.
5757920	5758720	No, he is helping.
5758720	5758960	Is he?
5758960	5760000	I was in chronic pain.
5760000	5760320	Okay.
5760320	5761200	All right.
5761200	5761680	I don't know.
5761680	5762000	He's helping.
5762000	5762640	It's all fake.
5762640	5763600	He's trying to help you.
5763600	5765920	He's trying to help you out, and you're making fun of him.
5765920	5767440	You're giving shit to him.
5768400	5769840	Making fun of this poor man.
5769840	5770960	He's trying to help your back.
5771040	5775040	You know, for someone who's taking voice classes, your voice is still so high.
5775040	5776960	I've only had one class.
5776960	5777760	One class.
5777760	5778640	You know, it's a bad-
5778640	5779360	One class.
5779360	5780800	You got to put in the work.
5780800	5782400	He's not going to lower your voice.
5782400	5783760	I did it yesterday.
5783760	5785600	It's like what Brandon said.
5785600	5789760	If we put in work as ourselves, don't put all the effort on him.
5789760	5790720	It's like what he just fucking said.
5790720	5791760	I'm not the enemy here.
5793920	5794880	That's it.
5794880	5797360	I can't believe he's not done with it yet.
5797360	5798160	That's been empty for an hour.
5798160	5800080	How is there still half a bottle?
5801680	5804560	Half a bottle still left in there.
5805600	5806560	I'm nursing it.
5808160	5809840	He calls that a magnum.
5809840	5810320	Why is that?
5812080	5812640	All right.
5812640	5816320	Well, maybe we should close with a what have we learned rap.
5818880	5819360	All right.
5820640	5821600	We all look at Brandon.
5821600	5822560	What if we said no?
5828160	5829680	Oh, shit.
5829680	5830320	Oh, shit.
5831840	5835680	Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
5837440	5837680	Yo.
5838480	5839680	Which wall?
5848320	5849360	I was just saying-
5849360	5850960	Was I doing 80s beatbox?
5850960	5854080	Yeah, there's a sample to start off the rap.
5856080	5857520	It's like doing the 80s.
5857520	5858640	Make shit relevant.
5859440	5860000	That is hilarious.
5860000	5862240	It's like a KRS-1 political song.
5862240	5863520	I know.
5863520	5865520	No M-O-K, no Malcolm.
5865520	5866000	Reagan.
5871200	5873600	Well, let me start you off, Brandon.
5873600	5875200	I'll lay you a beat down.
5875200	5875760	Oh, shit.
5881440	5882480	I heard him double up, too.
5882480	5883360	Did you just double up?
5884480	5885840	Oh, double up.
5885840	5886640	All right.
5886640	5887760	Did we get a-
5887760	5888400	All right.
5888480	5889040	All right.
5889040	5889440	All right.
5889440	5890400	Here's what we learned.
5890400	5892720	Matter of fact, you better get down and you can only earn.
5892720	5895120	Being smart, maybe, under Trump.
5895120	5897360	You get into trouble, but you soften and lops.
5897360	5898480	I mean, you breaking them up.
5898480	5899920	Making sure niggas pay rent.
5899920	5902320	Making sure you get money and the cashier gets spent.
5902320	5904000	On the dope thing that you can afford.
5904000	5906000	But baby boycott, don't give them the money.
5906000	5907920	The shit they already got.
5907920	5908800	Fuck that.
5908800	5911040	Pay your taxes, but don't shop in malls.
5911040	5913040	Matter of fact, you can shop in these balls.
5913040	5913760	I'm kidding.
5913760	5914240	Fuck it.
5914240	5915040	I had to laugh.
5915040	5917680	Motherfuckers looking around, but I signed autographs.
5917760	5918960	We got these points next to me.
5918960	5920160	I've been up past this shit.
5920160	5922640	These motherfuckers is here to get down relevant.
5922640	5923840	I'm giving it to y'all.
5923840	5925200	So don't you fucking quit.
5925200	5926240	Come on, motherfuckers.
5926240	5927520	Try and make a fucking hit.
5934880	5937520	Tear down, tear down this wall.
5937520	5949280	Oh, we talking about kids and we talking about families.
5949280	5951840	We talking about his voice because it's so damn high.
5951840	5954400	How was her one woman show, young brother?
5954400	5956640	How was her one woman show, young brother?
5962080	5962720	Oh, that's it?
5962720	5963440	Yeah, that's it.
5963440	5964080	Oh, that's it?
5964080	5964560	That's it?
5964560	5965200	Oh, that's it?
5965200	5966320	Why don't you take it on?
5966400	5970080	The karate kid knew that he had to do kicks and shit
5970080	5971920	because he's like you and me.
5971920	5972800	We got kids.
5972800	5974000	We teach him what to do.
5974000	5976480	We tell him what's on the internet and how to poo.
5976480	5977760	We tell him who to be.
5977760	5978960	We tell him who not to be.
5978960	5980640	We say, fuck your kids right.
5980640	5981760	And now you fuck right.
5981760	5982880	That's who we are.
5982880	5984080	That's what we do.
5984080	5985280	I'm like you.
5985280	5986480	I'm not like him though.
5986480	5986980	Oh.

5996880	5997360	My name is Flo.
5997360	5998160	Wait, wait, wait.
5998160	5999040	What did you say?
5999040	5999760	What?
5999760	6000960	Talking at the same time.
6000960	6001600	Go with it.
6001600	6002080	What?
6002080	6004880	I'm going to do some flowing and I'm throwing and I'm throwing
6004880	6006880	to rap without doing mama throwing.
6006880	6009360	I'm on the beach, but I don't mean sand.
6009360	6011920	Going to fuck your mama so hard with my whole hand.
6011920	6014320	Going to take four fingers and my thumb.
6014320	6016640	I'm going to rock her up and down one
6016640	6019440	by one with all my brain and all of my mind.
6019440	6020880	I'm going to take her into the war
6020880	6023200	and throw her at a land mine.
6023200	6025200	I rack.
6025200	6026400	I rack.
6026400	6027520	I rack.
6027520	6028080	I rack.
6028080	6029920	And I roll your mama.
6032800	6033280	OK.
6033280	6034160	All right.
6034160	6035440	Let's end the show there then.
6035440	6036720	They applaud it.
6036720	6041840	The Sklar Brothers, everybody.
6041840	6042640	Brandon Johnson.
6044320	6048240	Spencer Crittenden.

6063920	6065280	And that's it.
6065280	6067680	I don't know where we are next week.
6067680	6070240	We've been moving back and forth between here and Starbirds.

6085760	6086720	Next week we're in Oklahoma.

6090080	6091840	We came here for the Oscars.
6091840	6094560	But when push comes to shove, we bail on you.
6095520	6102480	Did you get any of that?
