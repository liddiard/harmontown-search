0	13840	From the beautiful theater district in Boston, Massachusetts.
13840	26120	One of my favorite theaters in the United States, the beautiful Wilbur Theater here.
27120	32120	I'm sure you're very excited to announce my favorite words of all time.
32120	35120	Carment Town is now in session.
41120	43120	Spencer Crittenden!
52120	55120	Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
56120	60120	Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
60120	63120	Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
63120	67120	Let's bring out the mayor of Harmon Town. Give it up for Dan Harmon.
72120	74120	Thank you.
75120	77120	Thank you Boston.
79120	81120	My goodness.
82120	83120	Wow.
84120	90120	Oh and they have cabaret-style seating. This is wonderful. What a great theater. This is really nice.
90120	94120	I thought we had a one-person standing ovation, but that was the cocktail we took down there.
94120	99120	It sounds like they're standing up in their hearts. That's one of the warmest receptions we've ever gotten. Thank you Boston.
105120	107120	Thank you, thank you.
107120	111120	We haven't been in front of an audience in a while and had it come out here.
111120	117120	The last three weeks in Los Angeles we've been farting around and getting our sea legs back.
117120	124120	This is nice and I'm probably a little nervous because I wrote you guys a song because I wanted to get on your good side.
124120	134120	It's like I don't want to, yeah, I have that privilege where I could just not know.
134120	137120	There's a thousand people and they paid. What did you guys pay?
137120	138120	Too much!
138120	139120	Too much.
140120	143120	It's a working class town. It's always too much, right?
144120	149120	Everything's too much. I got toilets to make out of porcelain.
149120	153120	I didn't want to have you plunging them. Nor is that a bad occupation, sir.
155120	157120	I think this guy makes them.
157120	160120	To me it's all dredger-y.
160120	165120	I sit in a Zeppelin thinking thoughts for money.
165120	171120	So that 10 migrant workers then just type the thoughts for me.
171120	177120	And I love all of them more than any Republican.
178120	182120	I would sell you out, America.
184120	188120	If you're an unemployed welder who's been replaced by a robot, you're right.
188120	193120	I'm a coastal elite. I hate you more than the people we're bringing in over the border.
193120	197120	I'd love them because they pick my strawberries. I would trade you for anything.
198120	205120	It's all about extremes. It's a war between whether or not we're going to just let everyone flood in and eat each other alive
206120	209120	or whether we have to have a fucking baby schwitz.
211120	213120	Baby schwitz.
213120	214120	Coinded.
215120	217120	Hashtag baby schwitz.
219120	224120	And again, my apologies to people who through whatever connection or whatever philosophical loyalty
224120	234120	or actual familial connection feel offense at the now everyday, maybe glib comparisons to third Reichishness.
234120	240120	But I got to say, look, I've said it before. I'll say it again.
241120	245120	When it comes to comparing you to Hitler, I like to jump the gun.
246120	248120	I like to get way up early.
250120	256120	And I just think the worst thing that happens to you is you're a politician that got compared to Hitler too early.
256120	258120	And you should learn to live with that.
259120	263120	All politicians should be able to survive being compared to Hitler.
263120	266120	It's not that hard a litmus test.
267120	270120	Did you have a hard day, honey? Yeah, it was hard. What happened?
271120	273120	Some of the people compared me to Hitler.
274120	278120	Did you act like Hitler in any perceivable way?
279120	282120	Well, my health care bill's a little draconian.
283120	290120	Okay, but yeah, okay. They'll get over it, go to bed, sleep like a non-Hitler baby.
290120	297120	Now run that flowchart through today's reality. Have a hard day. Yeah, compare me to Hitler.
297120	300120	What did you do? Baby schwitz.
301120	304120	Baby schwitz. It sounds like a delicious beer.
306120	308120	Crack into a cold baby schwitz.
309120	312120	The press wants to get in. The real news or the fake news?
312120	315120	Oh, the Lugan press for sure. I mean the fake news.
316120	319120	Yeah, they're trying to get in, but they won't wait the two weeks.
319120	323120	Oh, honey, why do you need two weeks to let people in to see the kids?
323120	328120	What are you doing that takes two weeks to change about your baby schwitz?
328120	336120	It's either a room full of babies that deserve to be behind a beautiful, clean, comfortable chain link fence
337120	345120	that I'm not at all saying is inhumane, especially for criminals, which everyone is that tries to get in, no matter what.
346120	351120	There's above-board ways to try to get in, and if you don't, you're a criminal.
351120	358120	And if you're a criminal and there's like a baby blanket, you're a little in a Buck Rogers space blanket, you're fine.
358120	360120	Sorry, I don't want to get political tonight.
361120	368120	But, Dan, a lot of these babies are dangerous political dissidents and intellectuals, you know.
368120	370120	We've got to weed out the bad babies.
370120	379120	So even taking it, there should be a face value thing here, so it's like, I understand that you need the babies locked up.
379120	384120	Now, where do we get into this part where I'm like, hey, can I come take a look at them?
386120	387120	Maybe in two weeks.
388120	389120	What?
390120	392120	That's cause for alarm.
392120	402120	That's way more time than my landlord has to wait before he opens my fucking door and comes in and looks at my bong and like, right?
402120	407120	Like, when I lived in an apartment, I was like, I could yell at the landlord if he tried to get in.
407120	410120	And I was like, you need to wait 30 hours!
411120	412120	It's the law!
412120	415120	Oh, it's fine, but you haven't paid your rent in six months.
415120	417120	Yeah, so what? I got rights!
418120	420120	You need to wait 30 hours!
421120	423120	All right, anyways, here's my song.
424120	426120	That was Dan's Boston song, everybody.
431120	441120	These are turbulent times, and if you're having passionate feelings, and I don't even care if you're wrong, like, if your passionate feelings are wrong, like, look, I know I live in a bubble.
441120	442120	I'm coming out from LA.
442120	443120	You people are my hosts.
443120	445120	You're being gracious to me, rolling out a red carpet.
445120	446120	You're feeding me your food.
446120	448120	You're putting me up in your hotel.
448120	449120	I mean, yeah, you are.
450120	452120	I'm sure your tax is paid for that hotel.
454120	457120	I mean, I am a guest here, so I just want to thank you.
457120	460120	I did not intend to go off about this thing that everyone's talking about.
460120	468120	And if you are, there's a thousand people here, so there's probably a couple of you that have, like, feelings that I'm rubbing up against with my liberal claptrap.
468120	473120	And I want to thank you for zipping it.
474120	475120	It's what I was going to say!
475120	476120	Let me finish!
477120	479120	I was about to thank you for shut the fuck up!
480120	484120	But, no, I really appreciate that, because I don't want to start a fucking show with me.
484120	490120	And then someone's like, because we're just going to do what we've been doing on Twitter for six months.
490120	491120	Yeah.
491120	498120	I want to reward your patience and your silence and your, well, hopefully not your total silence, but maybe your intermittent applause.
498120	500120	You know what I could go for right now, Dan?
500120	501120	A song.
501120	506120	Yeah, well, a song and the smooth taste of a nice cold baby schwitz.
509120	512120	The low-carb beer with a nipple on it.
512120	513120	Yes.
513120	516120	Try new baby schlitz lime.
517120	519120	Tuck into the room temperature, titty.
521120	526120	That rewards you like a good mama after a hard day in the rock yard.
526120	527120	Baby schwitz.
532120	533120	Yeah.
533120	535120	All right, let's hear this song for God's sake.
535120	536120	Okay, I'm trying to look for it, okay.
536120	537120	All right.
537120	538120	I have not heard this song.
538120	540120	I didn't know that you composed a little...
540120	542120	Yeah, and I got to do it acapella.
542120	546120	If I had time, I would have gotten out GarageBand or something, but it would have been a disaster.
546120	552120	So it's acapella, I don't know, and I'm not really a singer or a musician, but you paid, so...
555120	557120	And I don't do a lot of research about the cities I go to.
558120	561120	I know the typewriter was invented here, that's it.
569120	575120	Boston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Bay.
578120	583120	And the tea you tossed into it made the British go away.
584120	591120	Your buildings and your streets are famous, so is all your food.
592120	598120	But here's what I've learned while walking from the lobby to my room.
599120	601120	You might be alcoholics.
602120	603120	Austin.
606120	610120	And I don't throw that word around.
611120	618120	You maybe have a problem, Boston, and that makes you my kind of town.
624120	630120	Boston, Massachusetts, you sits on the Boston Mall.
631120	635120	And you may...
636120	642120	be the cutest of them all.
648120	653120	So now you're on my side for, I got you for an hour and a half.
654120	658120	I could do whatever, now I could fart on a fucking shoe.
659120	662120	I spent a lot of, just spent most of the afternoon today.
663120	666120	I spent most of my afternoon today just hanging out by the Boston Bay.
667120	668120	It was so nice out there.
669120	670120	You're going to drop by that mall too.
671120	672120	The famous Mall of Boston.
673120	675120	They got Sephora, they got Baby Gap.
676120	677120	The birthplace of Quincy Jones.
678120	679120	Quincy Jones.
680120	683120	When he was working on Thriller with Button Gwyneth.
688120	691120	I was having some pizza up in what he called the North End, the North End, yeah.
692120	700120	And I was just typing in because I was here not that long ago and my girlfriend and I, we went and saw like all the kind of the big, you know, touristy, like historical spots.
701120	703120	And I just typed in like, let's see what I'm around historically.
704120	707120	And like number three on Yelp, Skinny House.
708120	711120	Famous for being a skinny house, that's it.
712120	713120	Oh, it's not, it's not.
714120	716120	Like the Paul Revere statue was number five.
717120	720120	Well, it's been there forever. What has it done for anyone lately?
721120	728120	It's the Paul Revere statue, like spit out burgers, you know, if you, it's there to keep the red coats away. It's doing its job.
729120	735120	Yeah, we take it for granted a little bit, but it's kind of a gargoyle, you know, you take a picture, you move on.
736120	737120	Skinny House, that sounds like important.
738120	742120	I thought it was a vegan restaurant when you, a skinny house.
743120	744120	It should be.
744120	751120	Yeah, the only restaurant where you leave thinner than you came in, that would be Beverly Hills.
752120	753120	You can't even get out.
754120	756120	Yeah, if we've done our job, you won't be able to leave.
757120	759120	We're going to feed you so well.
760120	761120	That you're a fire hazard.
762120	763120	But seriously, there is it now.
764120	765120	Obviously my view is skewed.
766120	770120	When I, my first few times I was in New York, I was working as a writer and all I saw was Times Square.
771120	773120	I was staying at a hotel and I'm like telling everybody,
774120	775120	it works like this and it's like that.
776120	778120	There's hot dogs all over the place and vomit.
779120	780120	I don't like New York.
781120	790120	And then my friend took me and like, he's like, no, there's like, you know, you got to go below a hundred and fifth and whatever the fuck people talk about there.
791120	803120	So I, my view of Boston is limited to a hotel lobby, but I will say, I think, I think it's safe to say there is a broader definition of when you're supposed to call the police.
805120	806120	Like.
807120	808120	Right.
809120	810120	On a man that.
811120	812120	Wait a second.
813120	814120	That is like.
815120	816120	Our show's being interrupted.
817120	818120	Oh.
824120	825120	It's.
826120	829120	Shrab is crawling onto the stage wearing an outfit or costume.
830120	831120	It's hard to explain.
832120	833120	Yeah.
839120	840120	It's hard to explain.
845120	846120	How's it going?
857120	858120	Rob Shrab, everybody.
861120	862120	Thank you.
872120	873120	Thank you.
875120	876120	I bet you thought I was a dog.
878120	879120	I thought you were a seal.
880120	881120	I thought you were doing like a little sealed bit.
882120	884120	The sea dog of the ocean.
886120	887120	The first rule of theater.
888120	889120	Always make an entrance.
890120	892120	Or be wait to be brought out.
895120	896120	He doesn't like being.
897120	898120	He doesn't like waiting to be brought out.
899120	900120	He doesn't like he's not a patient man.
901120	905120	So before we started the show, Rob was like brainstorming stage work and stuff.
906120	911120	Like I saw him pulling various props off the wall and he was like trying to use chairs as stilts.
912120	917120	It was really watching a master honing his craft and to see that that resulted in the result it did.
918120	919120	It was truly just wonderful for me.
920120	921120	This is only the first part of it.
922120	923120	Yeah.
924120	925120	This is act one.
926120	928120	Rob promises more costume changes tonight than Dolly Parton.
934120	935120	Oh look.
936120	937120	A stool with no back.
938120	939120	You get so sad then.
942120	943120	Where's he going?
944120	945120	Strob, everybody.
948120	949120	Our next guest.
952120	953120	Anyways.
954120	962120	I mean I'm just saying in the day that I've been in my hotel I have seen a lot of grown men.
966120	967120	He's going to hurt himself.
972120	973120	Steve come help.
974120	975120	Dan just continue.
976120	977120	Keep going.
978120	979120	Keep going.
980120	981120	He's stilting on chairs.
982120	983120	Keep going.
984120	985120	Do your thing.
986120	987120	Do your part and I'll do my part he says.
996120	997120	Get even with us.
998120	999120	Don't upstages.
1000120	1001120	Yeah.
1001120	1002120	You've been great.
1003120	1004120	Rob don't upstages.
1006120	1007120	You've been great.
1008120	1009120	Here's my impression of Strob on an airplane.
1012120	1019120	You know they say if you get on the airplane's Wi-Fi that's how you get hacked.
1022120	1025120	And then here's Rob at the hotel this morning in the lobby.
1026120	1029120	You know if you get on the hotel's Wi-Fi.
1031120	1033120	Isn't that how they get your credit card.
1036120	1037120	Yeah.
1038120	1043120	And I'm like yeah Strob have you heard that they're cutting people's ankles in the grocery store parking lot.
1045120	1048120	I'll forward you an email about it because I'm 70.
1051120	1054120	See he's a very prudent cautious man in real life.
1055120	1056120	He doesn't like to.
1059120	1061120	I'm prudent and conscious.
1065120	1067120	That was just me hitting the thing by accident.
1069120	1070120	It's very sensitive.
1073120	1075120	I feel like I'm rolling with a lot of punches.
1075120	1076120	You're doing great.
1076120	1086120	All right well don't don't unlike other people I don't need that.
1087120	1089120	I don't thrive on that.
1090120	1091120	I will earn that.
1091120	1095120	Like he's like you don't think I was would be doing that in my living room by myself.
1098120	1100120	Crawling around with a wookiee jacket.
1102120	1103120	I flew you out here man.
1104120	1105120	I know.
1106120	1113120	And I don't know if you heard the most recent show but it was like he he found out he was coach and he almost had a meltdown.
1114120	1115120	That's not true.
1116120	1118120	Had to bump him up to first class during the show.
1119120	1120120	What's the last time toilet maker.
1121120	1122120	What's the last time you flew first class.
1123120	1127120	Yeah never your boss maybe did on his way to a ceramic seminar.
1130120	1132120	To figure out how to gouge your labor.
1132120	1136120	You'd be okay with me sitting in the back of the plane while you're up there with your.
1137120	1147120	No I wouldn't feel okay because because I have empathy and I treat people with respect and I don't I don't Trump all over their shows and yes you know.
1148120	1149120	Very very nice.
1149120	1151120	I open my doors to my friends.
1152120	1155120	And then and then and then and then I respect and support them.
1156120	1157120	And then and then I.
1163120	1166120	So anyways my I was just I was going to say is that there's a lot of drunk people here.
1171120	1172120	It's a weird thing exactly.
1173120	1175120	It's weird. It's not the amount it's the age.
1176120	1185120	It's the fact that it's like all ages affair like like guys that just look like like a friend of my dad's like just swaying.
1186120	1187120	Like like people.
1188120	1189120	We were out last night.
1189120	1190120	We got into town late.
1190120	1194120	Dan and I went for a quick like like you know like like nightcap and there was a guy.
1195120	1198120	Let's put him at fifty seven years old fifty four.
1199120	1200120	He looked like a prop master.
1200120	1201120	Is that a reference.
1202120	1203120	You guys aren't TV showrunners.
1203120	1204120	You look like a prop master.
1205120	1209120	Yeah he looked like a like a like a like a vice principal of something.
1210120	1211120	And we're below the line.
1211120	1219120	And but he he he came out of the bathroom and he was like completely like using all the surfaces to not fall down.
1220120	1221120	Like you see no more.
1222120	1224120	But he had this he had this incredible.
1225120	1234120	If I was that drunk and I go oh fuck I got to make it all the way out there through a very narrow corridor of bar stools and people moving and people serving drinks.
1234120	1236120	I would I would get on my knees and say take me to jail.
1237120	1238120	But this is not good.
1239120	1240120	This is not good podcasting.
1240120	1243120	But this is the he was so excited about it.
1243120	1246120	This is what separates Boston from drunks that I see in Los Angeles.
1246120	1249120	This is the look on the guy's face as he was barely making it going.
1252120	1253120	Yeah very happy about it.
1254120	1255120	It's a friendly town.
1257120	1262120	I think I think that's the key because I was going to say in New York and LA like I've been in both New York and LA.
1262120	1263120	I've been with drunk people.
1263120	1271120	I've been with drunk people all the way up to Andy Dick levels of of actual Andy Dick and like there's that.
1272120	1278120	But even if you're not Andy Dick and you're famous and you have this like like tag in your head like like New York bouncers will be like they'll.
1279120	1291120	It's very impressive the way that they'll like even a guy who's like a functional alcoholic but he's in that dark pocket of the night like and he's just like he's he's pulling it off with his friends but the bouncer will be like nope.
1292120	1297120	Like he's like I have bartender go like not you.
1298120	1305120	You won't look me in the eye like it's very empathic and like sentimental kind of like like like hierarchy there.
1305120	1312120	It's like big big big big but but but I do think that I mean here there's like a support of the which I guess reminds me of Milwaukee.
1312120	1320120	It's like it's like that guy that guy had a smile on his face because he wasn't ashamed of what was happening to him because because the bartender.
1321120	1324120	Was probably after we left was probably like Kevin you want another one.
1325120	1326120	And he was like.
1327120	1337120	You know she probably put out a rope ladder for him to get to the bar and he and he said am I on a helicopter she probably said you can be Kevin you can be.
1338120	1340120	If you just dream had enough.
1343120	1349120	You were waiting for me to oh shit you're waiting for me to do the it's going to be that easy the master of accents.
1350120	1352120	You've heard my Australian tour.
1353120	1355120	I am a man of a thousand dialects.
1356120	1358120	What's what do you. They're liking that hat mate.
1359120	1360120	They're liking that happen.
1361120	1366120	Say that you like the hat that hat mate but in a full hardcore Southie Boston.
1370120	1372120	I just know that ours go away.
1373120	1378120	But I do know my friend Dave Horowitz I think he lived here for a while and he said at this very theater there was a Blue Man group show.
1379120	1381120	And there was a commercial for it on TV in the 90s.
1382120	1389120	And he told me about he's like oh you're going to Boston every time I think of Boston I think of this hilarious commercial for the Blue Man group at the Wilbur theater in the 90s.
1390120	1400120	And it was a Blue Man group and it was one of those things where they do the theatrical testimonials like the audience people are like like the every man Joe is like like like come see the show.
1401120	1403120	And I'm trying to find the quote.
1404120	1406120	He told me fuck God damn it Harmon.
1406120	1409120	There are people in the sky. There's three. There's two balconies.
1412120	1415120	Rob Rob Rob Rob that's called a balcony.
1416120	1417120	OK. Sorry.
1418120	1419120	So it's just it is.
1420120	1424120	He's it. There's just this guy with like a baseball hat on any any guy we're all going to die.
1427120	1429120	It's for Blue Man group. They're like Blue Man group.
1430120	1431120	Come see the show.
1431120	1437120	Critics are raving the Blue Man groups at the Wilbur theater and then there's just this guy in the lobby of the Wilbur doing one of those testimonials from Boston.
1438120	1441120	He goes like he goes hell of a ride. Pack your bags.
1448120	1450120	It was like Greg Greg Cripps old joke.
1451120	1452120	Because I love being in Boston.
1453120	1455120	Every girl you talk to is like flirting with Cliff Clavin.
1455120	1461120	Yeah. I got pulled over in Delaware once by a cop and I could.
1462120	1465120	It was my first time talking to anyone from that region at all.
1466120	1473120	And I was so I was going through this horrible experience because I was like I felt like the other man's coming down on me and it's like but also he's like it's like a cartoon.
1474120	1475120	He's like you don't have an insurance card.
1476120	1477120	I was like come on. This is silly.
1479120	1482120	You can't have a gun. You sound like you sound like a TV show.
1483120	1484120	But then people where I'm from.
1485120	1488120	If you tell them how I talk where we come from people go like no that's Fargo.
1489120	1490120	That's not real. I'm like that is real.
1491120	1492120	We talk like that in Milwaukee.
1493120	1496120	I have just dropped that accent in support of a professional career.
1498120	1500120	I no longer speak like a Philistine.
1502120	1503120	I talk like Tom Brokaw.
1505120	1506120	All the time.
1507120	1508120	I have no nasal twang.
1509120	1510120	I lost the song.
1511120	1513120	Luster you guys are losing faith in me.
1514120	1515120	No we're not Dan we love you. Okay.
1516120	1517120	Okay. Here's the thing. All right.
1518120	1519120	Oh come on. Really.
1522120	1523120	What are you Tony Danza.
1526120	1529120	I'm sorry. You want me to be uncomfortable. Okay.
1530120	1533120	I don't know. Would you rather I'd be uncomfortable because it's your show.
1539120	1541120	I'm sure I've pointed out the harm in town.
1542120	1543120	Basic is a table.
1544120	1547120	What was the we took a long a car ride from.
1548120	1549120	Okay. You want it. You want it.
1550120	1551120	This is something. I don't know.
1552120	1556120	Do you guys know the whole ride from Dan's place to LAX takes about.
1557120	1558120	Let's call it 40 minutes.
1559120	1561120	40 minutes to an hour.
1563120	1564120	That's fair. That's very fair.
1565120	1566120	Something to get off my chest.
1567120	1570120	Do you guys have movie posters here.
1571120	1580120	Like like not just movie posters like coming this summer but but like like like like bus stop signs that have movie posters and stuff like that.
1581120	1584120	Okay. Okay. So you know what a movie poster is.
1586120	1590120	Now we could get now we can start. Okay now we can get my thing.
1591120	1600120	Okay. I don't know if you guys heard about this but a couple of months ago and I think it's still in theaters there was this movie called Peter Rabbit.
1601120	1603120	And it's about a. Yeah.
1605120	1611120	And it's about a movie with a bunch of computer generated rabbits in it.
1612120	1613120	One of them named Peter.
1615120	1616120	I know it's about time.
1616120	1622120	I haven't seen this movie I'm sure it's fine and I'm sure the people worked really hard on it.
1624120	1638120	But the advertisers there's a poster that says and I go through this every time one of these movies comes out it says there's a picture of Peter Rabbit no pants shirt going like this.
1639120	1652120	In front of a blue void and then it says in big blocky letters better eight than never ATE better eight than never.
1653120	1656120	Right. What the fuck does that mean.
1657120	1659120	What the fuck does that mean.
1661120	1666120	Is this is this a sequel to a movie that he ate something in.
1668120	1674120	Is this is this something that we've been waiting for the Peter Rabbit movie.
1675120	1682120	Where's Peter Rabbit. God damn it. Better eight than never. Good. Wait a minute. Why.
1683120	1688120	Well because he doesn't have to be like Peter Stomach or something you know like Peter Peter Peter Peter.
1689120	1696120	You know like better better. But he's got no pants on and he's jumping like this his stomach is flat is washboard I.
1698120	1709120	And is he holding a carrot. No no no no carrot. No stump carrots. No nothing. Not a pile of carrots. He doesn't have an empty plate. No no better eight than never.
1710120	1725120	This happens all the time. Remember the fucking Peabody movie the dog movie. Oh yeah. Sherman and Peabody movie. The tagline for that was anybody. Come on. You know this. The job. The dog father of all comedy.
1729120	1737120	Sherman and Peabody. It's about a talking dog who gets a pet boy who travels in time not to mob times.
1740120	1744120	Dinosaurs Abe Lincoln Napoleon not to mob times.
1745120	1761120	And it's the dog father of all. You know that thing when we go well you know it's the mother of all comedies and then it's the you know the sisterhood of all comedies but the dog father of all comedies the godfather of all.
1762120	1771120	And we all know that there's the father of all comedies. That's a very common thing to say. But I guess. I guess dog and God rhyme. No they don't.
1772120	1780120	The dog father of all comedies better eight than never. Look for it. It'll piss you off.
1781120	1787120	You'll be driving down the street and you'll go rabbit eight. I guess all animals eat.
1788120	1798120	And this one must have ate something and he's happy about it and I should go see this movie because of why. Because it's better than never.
1802120	1810120	Never can't come and soon enough because that's when I'm going to see your movie. Jesus.
1818120	1824120	Better better eight than never. Get the fuck out of here with that. Get the fuck out of here with that.
1825120	1834120	I got to pick the kids up. It's going to be like the four or five's a parking lot. Why don't we just better eight than never. Okay. Send it. Put it out.
1835120	1843120	I got to get home. I got to get home. There's the fucking water jug guy is delivering today. If I don't if I don't know.
1844120	1850120	Sir you're the head of a studio. You should. We need you to sign. Nobody's watching. Nobody cares. Just driving by.
1851120	1857120	Rabbit. They see a bunch of words. Maybe I'll see it. I got one of those posters to just say custody weekend is coming.
1860120	1874120	They should just say drop your kids off. They'll be relatively safe for two hours. Probably not. When did when did when was rhyming such an important part of movie tag lines.
1875120	1890120	I mean long long ago in a galaxy barbed wire away. Doesn't rhyme with anything. You know. Twenty six million years in the making. You will believe a man can fly. Right. Right. In space. No one can hear you scream. No rhyming involved. Now everything is like better up and up.
1895120	1896120	You're right. You're right.
1897120	1906120	Levy Levy what was the Yogi Bear one. Oh yeah. You remember the Yogi Bear. Great things come in bears.
1906120	1922120	That's a that's a very Boston which I can see why that captures your heart. It feels like a very. How you like them apples. Sounds like. Sounds like a gay porn.
1923120	1942120	That's why they like. Yeah. Great things come in bears. This is retarded. This is retarded. I'm coming in your bed. Wicked piss. Fucking your bed.
1943120	1944120	Fucking a chair.
1952120	1970120	I hope it's another bear. I hope it's a great bear. I think it's Mark Wahlberg. I think he's that's that's why he talks to animals so much. He's he's he's grooming them. That's why he bought a zoo. Did he did he buy a zoo. That's why he bought it. That's Matt Damon.
1970120	1988120	I get those guys mixed up. Yeah I'm going to accept that groan. I might have gone over the line. I might have accidentally asked you to trivialize pedophilia in your mind. That's good to find your boundaries Boston.
1989120	2002120	Certainly didn't find him in the elevator like guys that look like they should be a senator just fucking swaying and breathing out of their ears. They're so drunk and they're like like clapping their hands randomly.
2004120	2016120	I mean they're probably from out of town but you're I got an elevator and you laid out that carpet for them. We're staying in it. We're staying at a nice hotel and we are stupidly chose to stay way up top. I think I'm on the top floor.
2017120	2035120	So stupid big convention in town. It's like a big car thing. So it's a lot of like fast and furious looking dudes like a lot of big lot of giant like very tanned biceps and a lot of big fake titties. And it's and and so I get to stop at every stop on the way down. And it's just a lot of cologne. It's a potpourri of muscles and perfumes.
2036120	2052120	And everybody's lovely and nice and like no one was a jerk and everything. But just one guy gets in and he's just you know he's like probably my age but because of all the tanning he looks a little older and he's really big and buff and he stands. He does a thing where he doesn't turn around and face the door. He just because we're rammed in there. So he's got his back to the door. He's like.
2053120	2055120	No one talks in elevators.
2056120	2058120	Anybody got any coke.
2058120	2061120	I'm the guy. Oh there's a kid. Hey kid you like to do coke.
2062120	2079120	I don't like that guy. I don't like that guy. They got the guy that gets on the bus or the tram or the you know and it's just like what is this the fossil fire. Come on. Put a smile on your face like wait. Come on. We're not we're not sitting here in silence because we lack the fucking aptitude to.
2080120	2086120	To be jocular. We're just we're in mass transit. We're having a bad day. We're minding our own business.
2088120	2090120	People eat people on these things.
2091120	2095120	We want we're prepared for that. How's that sound. We weren't prepared for your open mic.
2096120	2103120	And then the door the door opened and it wasn't really room for three people but three people were waiting to get on like halfway down and he goes he goes.
2104120	2108120	I can't do the accident because you're cute. You get out. We'll kick some of the ugly guys off.
2109120	2112120	Every floor had a new routine. It was it was it was disappointing.
2113120	2114120	Was anybody like going.
2115120	2116120	Well they have to.
2116120	2120120	That's the thing is that people nervous laugh and then they take the nervous laugh and they don't.
2121120	2124120	Something in their brain doesn't tell nervous laughter from fucking real laughter.
2125120	2126120	I'm killing over here.
2128120	2131120	We got him in L.A. We got him in Burbank. We got him in Detroit.
2132120	2133120	We got him in Detroit.
2135120	2136120	We're looking.
2137120	2138120	In America.
2140120	2141120	The Huey Lewis song.
2142120	2145120	Is Boston mentioned in the Huey Lewis song the Heart of Rock and Roll.
2146120	2158120	Or is it or is it because when I was when I think it is my local radio stations had a version of that song and then he would like I think Huey Lewis like said all 70 thousand American cities and then they would put it in.
2159120	2161120	So it's like during the like the extended dance mix.
2162120	2168120	You guys are too young to be have been alive at a time when there was radio let alone when radio was so unaccountable.
2168120	2171120	When we Lewis tended and mixes were being played.
2172120	2174120	Huey Lewis at one point roamed the earth as a god.
2176120	2184120	There was just not enough Huey Lewis to still stretch what they had out into power mixes while you were driving to work at your sundial plant and.
2187120	2197120	To prepare your bronto burgers and and so and then they would just have random snippets of Huey Lewis going Milwaukee because you lived in Milwaukee and I'm assuming that.
2198120	2199120	That he is somewhere else he's like.
2200120	2201120	Medford.
2202120	2203120	Yeah.
2204120	2205120	Valencia.
2206120	2207120	Heart of Rock and Roll.
2208120	2209120	Oh so anyways.
2210120	2211120	Kudos you guys.
2212120	2213120	Your vending machines.
2218120	2221120	Is the pay range thing catching on pay range.
2222120	2223120	Have you heard of this.
2224120	2225120	One person.
2225120	2226120	All right.
2226120	2227120	That's awesome.
2227120	2229120	I was so sad last night because I'm in a hotel.
2230120	2233120	The food room services in the past 11 which I don't understand.
2233120	2235120	Like if I if I'm if I'm in a.
2235120	2241120	Why would you why would you stop having people make food for people in a hotel after 11.
2241120	2245120	When if I wanted food before 11 I wouldn't eat at a hotel.
2245120	2247120	I don't know that doesn't make any sense.
2248120	2250120	What do you think room service is for.
2250120	2252120	I'm drunk and dangerous like.
2253120	2258120	Quell me or face the fucking urban legends that will befall you.
2260120	2266120	I have a sea of accountants and lawyers I can do anything I want to this weird hipster colonial art.
2269120	2272120	I could just fold this up and put it in my duffel bag.
2272120	2273120	I like Paul Revere.
2275120	2278120	I've done I've broken shit lately.
2278120	2280120	I'm entering a dark chapter of my life.
2281120	2286120	I've just unscrewed weird urban art fixtures and just like dropped them.
2286120	2292120	And I've gotten very good at putting putting together like Legos the remote control because the remote controls never work at some point.
2292120	2293120	I just throw it out the wall.
2294120	2295120	I'm going to put that back together now.
2297120	2298120	Yeah.
2298120	2305120	You know people take you know people take remote controls traveling because it's more it's easier for them than like using the fucking hotel remotes.
2306120	2307120	Yeah. That's brilliant.
2307120	2308120	That's like next level.
2308120	2309120	That's fun.
2309120	2310120	I love you too.
2310120	2311120	That's nice.
2311120	2312120	Anyways.
2312120	2313120	Thank you sir.
2313120	2317120	I got a little digression there but you said the key is fill me with chili and you won't have a problem.
2317120	2319120	But that's the key.
2319120	2320120	But so I was very sad.
2320120	2321120	There's other problems.
2321120	2324120	I got back to the hotel at like 11 10 or something.
2324120	2325120	There's no room service.
2325120	2326120	There's nothing you can do.
2326120	2327120	There's nothing.
2327120	2328120	Oh God. Are there vending machines.
2328120	2329120	I don't know.
2329120	2330120	I call the front desk guest services.
2330120	2331120	I'm like wait.
2331120	2332120	Why is there a guest services.
2332120	2333120	Have that guy make sandwiches.

2457120	2458120	I went back to my room.
2458120	2461120	I'm like I'm eating a free bag of popcorn from a vending machine.
2461120	2463120	Because I downloaded an app.
2463120	2465120	Like like homeless people don't have a chance.
2465120	2466120	They're never going to.

2471120	2473120	There's there's people out on the street going.
2473120	2474120	Can I please have a quarter.

2486120	2487120	Here's your popcorn.
2488120	2490120	I didn't even do anything.
2490120	2492120	I didn't make a toilet for that money even indirectly.
2493120	2497120	Even the toilet making that I do in Hollywood called Monster House.
2497120	2498120	Like I don't.
2498120	2499120	None of that went into this thing.
2499120	2501120	I was like I was like I did nothing.
2501120	2503120	I was just a dude with a phone.
2503120	2506120	So I got popcorn for being a dude with a phone.
2506120	2509120	So I went back and then I'm like these people need all my money.
2510120	2512120	Like whatever they're working on that needs to spread.
2512120	2514120	And it needs to be how all of society works.
2514120	2517120	So I did do go through the maybe 40 to 80 minute process of getting my
2517120	2518120	credit card in there and.
2519120	2523120	But but but it's it's it's an app for vending machines.

2588120	2589120	eliminated it.
2589120	2594120	It goes hey you like Diet Coke two for one bro get over here.

2666120	2669120	That would be if this was a comedy album that would be a great it would be like OK then
2669120	2672120	there'd be a little bit of silence and then my next bit would be like diapers are hard
2673120	2674120	to buy.
2677120	2679120	I don't have kids but I wish they were easier to buy.
2679120	2682120	So now you do you still have credit on.

2691120	2694120	No it's like it's like everything is everything's being apified.
2694120	2697120	So it's like like it's like it's like this.
2697120	2711120	This thing uses other apps and banks and things to like like interfaces with Apple Pay or MasterCard has a thing that's like Apple Pay or there's like all these services where you can take a credit card.

2770120	2772120	I was like weeping to my girlfriend.
2772120	2777120	I was like this is I have a sea of text messages like and she's going OK I'm glad you're happy.
2780120	2784120	But I didn't punch a wall and I didn't break any light bulbs.
2784120	2790120	Just because I didn't I didn't get on Twitter and like yell at a 15 year old kid until he hung himself.
2790120	2793120	Because you were descending into a diabetic coma.
2793120	2795120	Yeah.

2822120	2823120	This is churn.

2831120	2835120	What a lot of people don't know and Dan would be embarrassed if I mentioned it.
2835120	2844120	I looked at my hotel window last night about 1 a.m. and there was Dan standing in this corner of Charles and Stewart just handing food out to the homeless all night long.
2844120	2845120	Just here's some.
2845120	2846120	It was adorable.

2859120	2860120	What'd you do.
2860120	2861120	Would you do anything.
2861120	2862120	I yelled at people online.
2862120	2867120	What's the beef.
2867120	2870120	Let's skip it.
2870120	2872120	What's your beef.
2872120	2879120	I forced myself to stay up until like 3 a.m. just helping places I wanted to eat at when I got up.
2879120	2890120	I didn't have to force myself because there were two ladies upstairs on the balcony talking all night long.
2890120	2891120	Wait.
2891120	2892120	Let me.
2892120	2893120	I can't believe I'm doing this.
2893120	2898120	Do you mind if I disrupt you for a second.
2898120	2899120	I can't even.
2899120	2901120	I can't even believe myself.
2901120	2902120	Why do I.
2902120	2908120	But I just want to put the wheels in motion because I have a friend here that I want to I want to introduce people to.

2913120	2916120	Aaron McGathey everybody.
2916120	2917120	It's a lie.
2917120	2918120	It's a lie.

2924120	2925120	Yeah.
2925120	2926120	It's a weird thing.

3043120	3044120	Laura is a very popular podcast.
3044120	3045120	It's you know Aaron's kind of a self starter and it's like.
3045120	3046120	It's lore.
3046120	3047120	It's like.
3047120	3048120	Which I would describe as the.
3048120	3049120	I'm a big fan.
3049120	3050120	I'm a big fan.
3050120	3051120	I love this shit.
3051120	3052120	Holy shit.
3052120	3053120	Yeah.
3053120	3054120	For those who don't know.
3054120	3055120	Laura is a very popular podcast.
3055120	3056120	It's you know.
3056120	3059120	Aaron's kind of a self starter and it's like.
3059120	3060120	It's lore.
3060120	3064120	It's like which I would describe as the crossroads between legend and
3064120	3065120	historical fact.
3065120	3066120	Right.
3066120	3071120	Like like it's like oh for every for every vampire that we hear exists
3071120	3076120	there's like a reason why we heard vampires exist which goes back to some
3076120	3079120	actual historical thing and that's what lore is.
3079120	3080120	Right.
3080120	3082120	That's a pretty good description.
3082120	3083120	Yeah.
3083120	3085120	So I discussed football in politics.
3085120	3086120	Yeah.
3087120	3091120	But but you know and I think I think particularly like I would say the
3091120	3094120	real reason for the success is that you take it very seriously you're
3094120	3097120	you're a good researcher and you're a good you're a good performer too
3097120	3099120	like you you're reading your own stuff.
3099120	3106120	You kind of you kind of to me you embody why a podcasting is better than
3106120	3108120	other media at its best.
3108120	3112120	It's because there's an authenticity in addition to the professionalism.
3112120	3117120	You're not just a mannequin that was like that would be hot but but that
3117120	3120120	was that was like that was carved out by the system's needs.
3120120	3123120	So it's like oh he's really good at making people believe him.
3123120	3126120	So he's cast behind this desk and then these people that are good at
3126120	3128120	writing things and these people are good at shooting things.
3128120	3131120	You're a one man team that like you're interested in this stuff and then
3131120	3135120	you you are who you are and your personality like exudes so we can trust
3135120	3139120	you and listen to you talk about Loch Ness and vampires and werewolves and
3140120	3146120	magic beans and we made they're the magic fruit.
3146120	3152120	We we we made friends online because I because I tweeted that that after
3152120	3155120	listening to your podcast a lot and I'm going to have Aaron like read you so
3155120	3157120	that people aren't familiar with him.
3157120	3160120	I'm going to have him do a cold read of one of his lore
3160120	3168120	openings which I just feel I have a certain style to them and to the point
3168120	3175120	where I like I tweeted that after I make love to Cody I like to just finish by
3175120	3185120	saying I'm Aaron Menke and let me say Cody has confirmed this is true and
3185120	3189120	then you tweeted back and we're like clearly unoffended by it and and we
3190120	3194120	became fast friends we met up for drinks and and and we like we like each
3194120	3203120	other's jibs but yeah I mean yeah I'm not good at anything like but do you
3203120	3208120	want to let's just give him a taste of this is this is this is Aaron doing a
3208120	3212120	live cold read of kind of like what he does at the top of each of his episodes
3212120	3215120	you've got one pulled up that's the text and you Jeff you've got some of the
3215120	3220120	music I got some of your music here yeah make sure to eat that Mike brother
3220120	3224120	yeah get the mic right close he was Boston they don't fucking do you want
3224120	3230120	me to start can I get a lapel mic please and a suit jacket and a glass of
3231120	3236120	Chablis do you have the music to begin please okay here we go yeah
3249120	3255120	on June 24th of 1408 a French court sentenced a murderer to death by
3255120	3260120	execution she had entered the home of a neighbor and found a four-month-old
3260120	3265120	child inside alone and unattended although she never disclosed her reason
3265120	3272120	for doing so she killed the child right there in the house after her trial she
3272120	3276120	was moved to the prison to be held until her execution the others who were
3276120	3281120	imprisoned there most certainly jeered at her they called her names this they
3281120	3286120	were hardened criminals but to kill a child even they were appalled the
3286120	3293120	prison however treated her with the same as the same as those men charged charged
3293120	3298120	her family the same day they raid for her meals the quality was a rare thing
3298120	3304120	for her easy on July 17th she was guided to the platform in a rope was placed
3304120	3309120	around her neck a crowd was most likely gathered that day to watch the spectacle
3309120	3314120	like the criminals inside the prison they too had mocked her and shouted
3314120	3321120	insults then after the trapdoor snapped open she plummeted to her death it was
3321120	3328120	over history is full of these stories a criminal goes to trial and justice
3328120	3334120	wins the day what was odd about that trial in 1408 though was the suspect
3334120	3339120	because she wasn't a local woman or even a relative of the child she killed
3339120	3348120	she wasn't even human you see she was a pig literally a farm animal tried in the
3348120	3354120	court of law and sentenced to be put to death and then executed on the gallows
3354120	3357120	three weeks later
3357120	3368120	say it say it better eight than ever
3388120	3393120	during the long history of criminal trials spanning cultures and centuries
3393120	3398120	all manner of oddities have entered the courtroom as unusual as it might sound
3398120	3405120	to put livestock on trial humans have been guilty of worse you see sometimes
3405120	3424120	even the dead get to testify I'm Aaron Mankie this is Harman town
3424120	3429120	it's the podcasting equivalent of having like Skrillex up here you know it's
3429120	3433120	like wow he really does just do it that way I thought you'd be like well I need
3433120	3439120	70 takes yeah I think you paused and we thought you were gonna say I'm Aaron
3439120	3444120	Mankie and you said better eight than never that wasn't in the original was it
3444120	3448120	no all right just checking just because it would have worked there that would
3448120	3451120	that would have been great it would have been great in there I would have been
3451120	3454120	okay on that poster do you want me to go back and edit that audio would you
3454120	3459120	please for the old episode you please do you please do you think back in 1408
3459120	3462120	they were frugal enough and thrifty enough that they ate that pig or do you
3462120	3468120	do not eat a condemned peg a pig I'm gonna guess they ate it yeah I mean I
3468120	3473120	want very badly to be able to do this because I like most fans of podcasts
3473120	3478120	like we listen we listen to you and then we like I want to do I want to do what
3478120	3481120	you do and I don't know if I but I and I've been thinking like well Jeff has
3481120	3486120	the music and I want to try doing it but but like I don't know how to like like
3486120	3491120	like like I just want to try one you just you just play the play the music
3491120	3498120	and give me a will you give me a give me a topic to give me a give him some
3498120	3506120	folklore to riff on yeah I don't know if we're local enough for that I do Salem
3506120	3513120	witch trials what I've learned from you is I have to back up three three right
3513120	3518120	train boxes from Salem witch trials or even which is okay so we're gonna start
3518120	3522120	up by talking about the history ventriloquist then we'll work our way up
3522120	3542120	to yeah in 1981 Arnold Palmer was at the top of the charts he loved music
3542120	3551120	but what he really loved was socks socks made of cotton and Arnold Palmer
3551120	3560120	could only buy those socks in one store you see cotton was scarce and socks
3560120	3569120	being made from them were scarcer so when Arnold Palmer walked into the seers
3569120	3579760	that day what he didn't know well is that he'd be starting on fire the
3579760	3585200	fluorescent lights due to faulty wiring in the section above the men's socks
3585200	3594320	caught fire and fell on his head bursting him into flames and ending the
3594320	3609360	career of a celebrated musician you see America burns what it loves
3609360	3619600	whether it's Michael Jackson or a witch what is a witch and where does a witch
3619600	3631920	go if a witch doesn't know when I think about witches I think about Salem the
3631920	3643840	capital of witches but not a good place for them to live you see in Salem as far
3643840	3658320	back as 1492 these witches far from sailing the ocean blue were subjected to
3658320	3668200	the opposite of oceans fire the same fire that burnt Arnold Palmer and Michael
3668200	3677920	Jackson and eventually the Loch Ness Monster but that cold day in 1492 Salem
3677920	3688960	was about to learn that what goes around burns around I'm Aaron Mankie this
3688960	3703920	is Laura I have a couple follow-up questions about Robert Palmer by the way
3703920	3710720	Robert Palmer was not that it matters people forget about that not only was
3710720	3716600	only a great golfer but he had simply irresistible over that video where he's
3716600	3722520	got the golf club and the girls with the lipstick Arnold she's so fine she got a
3722520	3736760	bogey on the back nine she's so fine there's iced tea in her lemonade so your
3736760	3741040	so your podcast you you like go okay so there's these monsters and stuff and
3741040	3747560	this is this is how you get rid of them I mean it's not part of it no like if I
3747560	3751920	but but come on like if a Dracula shows up yeah if a Dracula showed up you could
3751920	3758720	say well actually garlic doesn't work on Dracula it only works on yeah I'm not
3758720	3763360	really the Neil deGrasse Tyson of folklore that's not what I do who is in
3763360	3774720	your opinion today in the world no no like but you know I'm I'm I'm I'm I
3774720	3779120	haven't heard of this until now so I'm gonna check it out well here's the rock
3779120	3785480	because you're not you know you're you're more of a dog he's more of a
3785480	3791840	visual guy you'd be happy to know he's he's working on his second season of the
3791840	3795320	hit show lore based on his podcast and there's a season out what is it Amazon

3801200	3806960	Patrick's in one you remember him from the Terminator he's so stupid you have
3806960	3818560	to trick him into smart stuff Robert Patrick Robert Patrick is stupid but
3818560	3823200	Aaron are you from Boston is that why no no I grew up in the Midwest okay why do
3823200	3826760	you have a relationship with the Wilbur I remember because you saw that I was
3826760	3830400	performing here you're like hey I'm gonna be there and the folks that run
3830400	3834360	the Wilbur have a tour company for folks like us okay and they represent me in
3834360	3838640	book book venues I played here year and a half ago you ever see the blue man
3838640	3845520	group here how would you get rid of a blue man back your bags all right what
3845520	3851800	gets rid of a blue man what's the origin of the blue man yeah it's a you make a
3851800	3857400	circle of salt right and it stops them okay all right Spencer will you do a
3857400	3873960	lore intro about the blue man group if it's bad all right somebody help me
3873960	3883320	let's talk about immigration okay I think it's a problem yeah it drives me
3883320	3886280	nuts is when it's somebody I like will post like a picture it'll go it'll be
3886280	3890680	like a picture of a pretty white girl and I'll say like separated from her
3890680	3896840	family when an immigrant shot her and you go okay like okay so you care about
3896840	3903640	people so so let's let's let's let's pass a bunch of sweeping legislation to
3903640	3906340	protect people I'm sure you're into all of those and then and then and then they
3906340	3910240	go well it's contrary to what you might think I'm not just some trailer trash I
3910240	3913160	do have opinions about us it's like why are we having a grown-up conversation
3913160	3916720	that you crashed with your fucking photo of somebody saying like a brown
3916720	3921680	person shot like people just post memes and then and then they're like they're
3921680	3925840	like look at this oogity boogity and it's like a dead rat they bring in from
3925840	3928920	the backyard and then you're supposed to dim the lights and pour some wine and
3928920	3934360	talk to them like adults like is that is that how you get rid of a blue man can
3934360	3938760	you get a blue rat no okay but what I keep looking okay but what could I get
3938760	3947840	rid of with that spell I think I'm not understanding the show yet it's well
3947840	3956200	still it's not it's about actual shit asshole the blue man group exists I've
3956200	3962600	seen commercials yeah so so name something dickhead name something that
3962600	3966680	doesn't exist telling him that I'm stupid with the Robert Patrick side

3993240	3997920	what you deserve me being in your life it couldn't have happened to a better
3997920	4007120	person so I found what it's like to be on Twitter right right yeah yeah well you
4007120	4010840	know you had you had a you had a little dust up with Krista Leah and you were
4010840	4015440	you you've been a you've been active on Twitter and you've been like you know
4015440	4020400	you're you're you're Aaron Mankie and and you're and you're and you're like
4020400	4023440	you have your opinions and you're like finding out what all of us are which is
4023440	4026680	like well people might like your podcast cuz it's about werewolves and they might
4026680	4030520	also maybe vote differently from you or like have a different like like opinion
4030520	4034080	and then you like tweet something and then people like pile on you right like
4034080	4038000	they go like what the fuck bro my girlfriend and I try to fuck we fuck to
4038000	4045160	your podcast man the fuck you talk about baby switch for talk about werewolves on
4045160	4051440	your Twitter her and then you're like eat me right yeah well you know in so
4051440	4056800	many words right yeah a better eight than ever right
4057960	4062640	probably but you don't get on Twitter to become a happy right like you we can
4062640	4065960	recognize at least as a population that we don't get on Twitter to make
4065960	4069480	ourselves happy we're getting on Twitter to make ourselves unhappy like we never
4069480	4074120	go like I'm so happy right now I I should be happier I'm gonna get on
4074120	4077840	Twitter if you're happy you forget to get on Twitter if you're sad you're like
4077840	4083560	I'm so fucking sad I don't know whether I should eat glass like like like eat a
4083560	4089400	box of donuts like like dip my head in turpentine or get on Twitter and like
4089400	4094600	Twitter is the closest thing you can do be friend of that mood what's that I said
4094600	4099000	or be friend vending machine yeah well no I mean that was a joyous night like I
4099000	4103920	won't have you you guys are acting like I was described I was happy last night
4103920	4107760	that's a that's a new thing I learned from my personal trainer Dave Klein if
4107760	4113960	you watch my Instagram workouts Dave Klein has been on the show you he told
4113960	4118320	me you know he kind of blew my mind with this I'm trying to I'm trying to practice
4118320	4124220	this and seeing how it goes he said you know love can be a weapon I didn't put
4124220	4129320	it that way it's like like like you can you can you can choose to express love
4129320	4134800	and be in a loving place as an axe actually as an assertion of your power
4134800	4138640	I'm paraphrasing him it's like like like like it doesn't we associate love with
4138640	4144100	like acquiescence and and like oh I'm I have to break through past all of my
4144100	4149760	needs to be in control and and and and not feel stupid and like all these
4149760	4153440	things that society kind of like demands of us in the moment like like kind of
4153440	4156760	like it's kind of incompatible with this idea we have about love which is that
4156760	4161480	you're Zen and you're open to everything and and you're even kind of
4161480	4165420	weak on purpose and you're osmotically going to absorb everyone's point of view
4165420	4170800	and stuff but there's this version of love where you can just be like I love
4170800	4175160	everything because that gives me power that makes me a good person and it gives
4175160	4182740	me power over everyone like it makes me a more evolved person I can you can
4182740	4185920	choose to do it for kind of selfish reasons to be like I'm in love with
4185960	4191680	what's going on right now because because I'm better than people I think
4191680	4194640	that's fair I mean that seems like it slots in with the four agreements
4194640	4199000	honestly it's certainly it's certainly like it's very good you know maybe it's
4199000	4202160	not the best way to be taught about love but it's certainly like maybe a rope
4202160	4206160	into the pit when you're not feeling love at all and you're like like man I
4206160	4210400	just want to like eat a rock right now I don't want to love anything and it's
4210400	4213800	always like yeah but you know you know what love is it's making everybody else
4213800	4218920	eat your fucking love shit you know like you can't like it's like if I get
4218920	4222000	off the elevator at Rick and Morty's offices and I come out and like and I'm
4222000	4227240	feeling like I love being there I'm gonna everyone else is gonna be happier
4227240	4232680	and do a better job and like like it's it's high it is strength and it is
4232680	4238860	leadership and it is how are you gonna do that 70 episodes
4238860	4249620	I mean by loving by loving it that's I love it that's so many damn it's so

5013320	5022280	great since Lara sorts papers

5043320	5046600	in 1492
5048680	5059480	to the Boston Mall in 1982 mankind or should I say some kind
5059480	5068560	has sought to answer one particular nagging question
5068560	5082160	who am I
5087840	5092560	where did I get here from grammatical
5092760	5094760	spell check
5101000	5113280	crunch crunch crunch how can I guarantee that a Dracula won't bury me alive the
5113280	5119720	answer has come in a variety of forms from shoes
5119720	5125960	hunk of trucks and tampons
5125960	5138160	but one thing continues to emerge on this winding road of mortality
5138160	5162400	I'm Aaron Mankie and this is the Omega protocol is it that was a good that's
5162400	5168720	good lining Aaron Mankie turns into a mock man

5287000	5296760	adjunct to the Iron Man come on spider-man all right all right let's hear
5296760	5301360	the blue blue blue man girl shit this is gonna be blue man group Laura intro by
5301360	5303840	Spencer
5312240	5319440	mankind has been eating food for years decades if we're honest and for most of
5319440	5326120	that time it hasn't been salted when John Wilkes Booth walked into the mall
5326120	5331080	one day he had no idea what he was about to add to the culinary culinary
5331080	5339080	landscape spying a big crystalline rock he needed to lick it and lick it he did
5339080	5343520	since then salt has been commonplace at the dinner table across America and the
5343520	5349200	world but that made no difference to Margaret Cho as she left her house one
5349200	5360800	morning headed to the same mall what she found was peculiar a corpse torn a
5360800	5367880	sunder covered in blue markings and surrounded by the remnants of a broken
5367880	5375760	salt circle no one knows what the first sighting of the blue man group was and
5375760	5383720	one doesn't have to to fear you see things that are blue have a way of
5383720	5393040	coming back around and things that aren't might just surprise you I'm Aaron
5393040	5397840	Mankie and this is lore
5400840	5408640	that's a good law that's a good law that's good I am a huge I'm a huge fan I
5408640	5413720	love your stuff you got the job thank you thank you yeah that's there's some
5413720	5418640	overlap with dungeon mastery no I know I seriously like the the real world take
5418640	5423240	on folklore is very inspiring as someone who we've spoke lore into fantasy you
5423240	5427600	know narratives I think it's really cool source of inspiration I constantly hear
5427600	5431520	from people that do D&D campaigns and they take inspiration from the show to
5431520	5441120	build stuff yeah I play D&D every week oh nice with racist while we're on the
5441120	5448600	topic everyone everyone right now that's the new thing alt-right D&D is taken up
5448600	5456000	man and a couple of campaigns ago I was a lore bard oh you believe it yeah a
5456000	5459800	lore bard yeah if you're a bard you can pick one of the colleges I always wanted
5460040	5464120	College of Lore oh yeah Lord bard and one of the one cutting words is one of the
5464120	5467360	best spells you just make fun of people the entire night it's great yeah you can
5467360	5471080	kill someone by insulting them it's amazing I would hate to get insulted by
5471080	5478280	Aaron Mankie can you imagine he'd go throughout history pants have had one
5478280	5488240	purpose to cover or present the extremities below the abdomen however
5488360	5496360	your pants appear to be entirely removed from that purpose well altogether
5496360	5501760	they look like raggedy-ass k-mart pants
5502760	5506520	I'm Aaron Mankie
5506520	5516680	you burnt and this is Lord bard I'm Aaron Mankie and those converse are piss
5516680	5522680	wipers I used to call bad shit piss wipers when I was a kid you had to have
5522680	5527920	like these big crazy your shoes had to be like raganomic fucking like Nike
5527920	5534160	things that had like pumps and Velcro and zippers and Michael Jackson had to
5534160	5539680	be in one of the laces and if you had anything lesser than that like something
5539680	5545160	that you know more recently would be really nice shoes that people like
5545800	5549520	they're like those can the canvas all-stars they were called piss wipers
5549520	5555600	because they kind of turned yellow over time piss wipers with a wicked piss
5555600	5561840	wipers wicked piss wipers you got wicked retarded piss wipers how do you like them
5561840	5571600	apples I like them just fine from the seas of Boston Bay to the to the hotel
5571600	5579360	that I'm staying in that's the two locations I know the home of Quincy
5579360	5587440	Jones go to little Italy eat a pie go to see a lantern in the sky old-timey
5587440	5594320	lanterns to if I see I don't know what I'm doing it's the jingle for the
5594320	5599000	Boston tourism board I don't know what I'm doing come check out our fancy
5599000	5607000	streets and see where fallout see how many happened that's what I was most
5607000	5614120	excited about like this is where fall out three is did our fall for four he
5614120	5618880	played it he actually played it you did you played Fallout 4 or no wait fall out
5618880	5624440	for was New Vegas I thought no fall new Vegas was after fall I'm sorry he
5624440	5627840	definitely played it I remember very happy that you guys are that upset about
5627840	5632200	it because that makes you my kind yeah you said you were gonna get political
5632200	5637160	tonight but wait let me I want to get this straight though it's like fallout
5637160	5643280	three was like the big one with yeah and then and then and then fall on New
5643280	5646600	Vegas and then fall out New Vegas which was not a number it was just fought yeah
5646600	5653280	it was like an expansion I said I'd fall out for Boston Boston yeah okay got it
5653280	5657200	that's why I got confused you get to go down like you get to go down the Liberty
5657200	5662480	Trail and kick ass yeah you follow the Liberty Trail that's a thing again from
5662480	5668000	your knowledge of fallout for how many stops do you think if you were true guys
5668000	5674360	you could name on the Liberty Trail no I didn't know I the place where you fight
5674360	5679960	the big giant and you hide in the cargo bin oh yeah the super mutants hide out
5680800	5683880	what what he's guys
5699560	5707120	he's communicating with them did you hear it's a mate like I like to just think
5707120	5710640	that they love all video games this much and if we were like overwatch they'd
5710640	5718560	be like tracer oh my god like they just love video games yeah yeah see I would
5718560	5721840	I would I would have been equally unsurprised though if you guys hated
5721840	5725800	fallout for it because it was like that's that's a bullshit reproduction of
5725800	5732760	our historical district there's no fish monster in the park and if there was you
5732760	5736040	certainly wouldn't have that many health packs around it he wouldn't need a legal
5736040	5745480	c-40 would have got my unionized the house all right well what have we done
5745480	5751680	so far it's a lot we've covered a lot of it is half of the the season of Rick and
5751680	5760480	Morty right we've done a bunch of episodes of lore the blue man rap that's
5760480	5764360	still to come don't worry I'd like to bring the word cockamamie back a little
5764360	5769880	bit right oh they're on board here's a thought a great way to make me less of
5769880	5773360	an elitist would be to show me how much better an anonymous horde would be at
5773360	5780520	running my fucking life or kill me you know yeah I'm an elitist I don't know
5780520	5785320	yeah I think I'm better than a bunch of people I don't know who the fuck do you
5785320	5791240	think I want to run my life a bunch of people I don't know all right I think
5791280	5794440	of course you guys wouldn't be into that you're a bunch of people I don't know
5794440	5800800	you're biased but each one of you is an individual is a fucking elitist and
5800800	5806080	you're very near the coast you're basically coastal elites I'm Aaron
5806080	5816200	Mankie you're burnt the elusive libtard is a creature referred to in the forests
5816200	5822520	and catacombs of almost every urban city throughout history as opposed to not
5822520	5829800	urban cities the libtard seems to manifest itself in times and places
5829800	5837680	where well people don't have much going on
5837680	5848160	Abraham Lincoln couldn't have expected his boots to start talking to him but
5848160	5857640	that's exactly what they did on the morning of October 11th 1928 returning
5857640	5863120	to his home having absconded with the Lindbergh baby a weary Lincoln placed
5863120	5870080	the child down on the table expecting it perhaps justifiably to fly
5871600	5876640	only to watch it die
5877240	5881520	Abe Lincoln would return that baby to the wooded edges outside the Lindbergh
5881520	5889680	estate but in so doing he would start a bit of a dilemma
5889680	5908320	among the rural non-elites you see Abe Lincoln was above all a libtard and he
5908320	5913040	had now killed the baby of perhaps one of the most celebrated blue-collar
5913040	5922240	heroes a man who single-handedly flew from Paris to New York thereby proving
5922240	5925960	that we didn't need the former
5930960	5940040	when Johnny Lindbergh was buried in those woods his fractured cranium oozing
5940040	5949840	baby brains I'm sorry Jesus I know I look try being me well I like this
5949840	5954040	weren't you I thought you were about to say chocolate and candies which wouldn't
5954040	5958120	have been offensive at all okay well I'm trying to wrap it up tonight's lore has
5958120	5964480	been brought to you by the cool refreshing taste of baby sweets by the
5964480	5971520	way it's time to crack open the baby sweet Laura's brought to you with
5971520	5976800	limited commercial interruption however you will be hearing some in line branded
5976800	5988000	content I'm Aaron Budweiser and this is the cold clear taste of fully
5988000	5997720	poisoned beer I don't know Aaron Minkie didn't you know never mind
5997720	6004160	Aaron Minkie what why do you like lore not that not that not the production the
6004160	6009120	the thing that made that you stole the title from this thing they're like lore

6023920	6027120	but you could easily there's a million podcast you could you could just be like
6027120	6032760	hey here's some like unresearched like fucking urban legends about werewolves
6032760	6037160	and things but you you you like the idea that the truth is that this stuff might
6037160	6042320	be that our world might be more magical or do you like the fact that we
6042320	6045920	shouldn't even be calling it magic it should just be called normal because
6045920	6052480	light real life is fucking creepy good question I'm like fucking Bob Costas
6053080	6057800	except you don't look like a little boy yeah Bob Costas looks like a little boy
6057800	6067360	all right I just knew I can't say Charlie Rose anymore no yeah yeah people
6067360	6070840	are monsters what are we talking about Ray isn't that is that like was that one
6070840	6074040	of your guiding themes that you wanted to express through the podcast or did
6074040	6077000	you find that after your research because that is a very that's like the
6077000	6081160	main theme and in your stuff right is that it's actually humans yeah it's
6081160	6085120	become that by originally it was Wow check out this creepy stuff I found out
6085120	6088440	about this village that dug up one of their ladies and cut her heart out and
6088440	6091440	made a tonic out of it and then they drank it well like the one that I heard
6091440	6097520	Aaron what do you call it you monkey lis monkey lis monkey lis yeah and like
6097520	6102480	there was no magic to that it's actual experiments on trying to create like
6102480	6106760	raise the dead it's like it's actual things that people actually did it's not
6106760	6110960	it's not mythical it's like these are people did this court cases that
6110960	6115000	actually happened yeah yeah get yourself a dried gourd and fill it with some
6115000	6118800	blood and some semen and maybe some ground bones and then shove it up a
6118800	6121880	horse's womb and wait for you and then crack open a nice cool baby
6121880	6131480	that's baby switch calm slash more offer code Lord get a gourd fill it with
6131480	6136440	blood and semen yeah and and put it in a horse that's been done because they're
6136440	6141360	I mean yeah that makes sense yeah I mean it doesn't make sense but we only know
6141360	6144760	it doesn't make sense because we're standing on the shoulders of scientists
6144760	6147960	exactly and actually that would be science at a certain point cuz you'd be
6147960	6152800	like well I other things have blood and semen in them and then a baby comes out
6152800	6157280	so you're like how about if I put blood and semen in a gourd it's kind of there's
6157280	6161240	a misogynistic underpinning there right it's like it's like like like men going
6161240	6167400	like come on we've got we gotta be able to do this alone it's it's it's it's they
6167400	6172480	keep pulling this out in every argument right like like without me people like
6172480	6175640	you wouldn't exist I just gotta be able to like wave something in her face and
6175640	6180960	go I could come in a gourd yeah I can make a horse gourd I haven't seen it
6180960	6184000	written yet but we can make the argument that the alchemists were like the first
6184000	6191800	in cells right yeah they're like they're definitely hacking and trolling and like
6191800	6195600	well what if lead was gold basically in her emails look there was there was a
6195600	6199440	there was an alchemist who believed he could take urine and distill it into
6199440	6203840	gold because you know they're both yellow yeah right so so he filled his
6203840	6208960	basement with buckets of his own piss do you want to riff this can we go the
6208960	6216680	no come on come on come on I want to hear what it sounds like when you do our
6216680	6221160	impression when I do Dan Harman does doing you can you try just try one do
6221160	6225960	that maybe to do buckets of urine or whatever you want all right you want me
6225960	6228720	to give you something else that's my favorite Bob Dylan song what about the
6228720	6231280	chupacabra
6234120	6237640	well you gotta play well can't get him with the music that's it that's his
6237640	6240800	spirit like that's what he needs
6242240	6250680	in 1120 one you honest fun fucking face wanted to make gold
6255000	6260560	they did they wanted to make cold it's right it's true I'm sorry for your
6260560	6271240	secret a little truth so he bought himself five dozen buckets using an
6271240	6277960	ancient home line the buckets up in his basement a nice grid and then he peed in
6277960	6285040	them it smelled he had asparagus that night but that's what happens
6285440	6290600	but six weeks later that urine had evaporated and left a sticky yellow
6290600	6293200	residue
6294240	6299440	sadly it didn't turn in the gold but that cologne kept the ladies away for
6299440	6312240	decades I'm Aaron making this is pulled out you pulled out it's good I mean
6312240	6315960	you've got the weapon that it is your real voice so you can yeah I mean it's
6315960	6321160	pretty it's just fun to listen to it all right well anyways so what these
6321160	6325440	people paid a lot of they paid top dollar like this especially toilet
6325440	6330800	toilet on a toilet maker salary the money these people paid tonight like
6330800	6336080	they're definitely entitled to D&D right

6546320	6554280	quest for Patchens Jim they tried not very hard they gave up easily and then
6554280	6560900	DJ went back at it and got captured sensing imminent defeat our heroes left
6560900	6567120	into action and went to rescue DJ and they found a fight oh they fought Jeff
6567120	6571960	turned into a tree a bear showed up a dwarf with a whittleball teleported
6571960	6577040	people outside of the building after all was said and done they had a hostage
6577040	6584440	they interrogated the hostage and that led them to Boykin Hodges pig farm at
6584440	6588880	the farm our heroes were interrogated by the mute Boykin Hodge and with his help
6588880	6595720	they found the stable they were looking for and the gem that was Patchens but
6595720	6599880	then they were attacked by that very same man who turned out to be a vampire
6599880	6606120	he was easily killed what will happen next
6606120	6611760	find out now on Harbin time
6617840	6624840	okay sorry everybody so you're in Boykin Hodges pig stables you just killed him
6624840	6629040	and he exploded into dust and skeletons after being staked by Gary
6629040	6637680	Shambling's fingers dust and skeletons he exploded into yeah multiple multiple
6637680	6642040	dusts mm-hmm I collected the dusts and put it in my
6642040	6650880	oh yeah you very much DJ that's very nice okay before sorry no you go thank
6650880	6659760	you that's not sarcasm you know before that was before killing this vampire I
6659760	6664400	was having second thoughts about whether or not we were good or bad people and
6664400	6672240	you know I'm a monster but you know I'm also a decent person so I you know but
6672240	6677560	we did some good work here or pretty much just me but I mean there was a good
6677560	6682320	things here cuz this vampire probably would have hurt some other people and
6682320	6689360	creating more vampires which would hurt other people so you're welcome I'm
6689360	6694400	gonna stick around I'm thinking stick around who's currently holding the gem
6694400	6698360	do you have it Carlos let's say Carlos yeah we were thinking about putting it
6698360	6703960	in the barony max but but because I should I should hold it because I killed
6703960	6707880	the vampire so just I support that thank you thank you bear you know they
6707880	6711400	say they say if you take a gem and you put some blood and some jizz on it you
6711400	6721920	put it up a bear's ass I don't know what they say I just yeah I am gonna hold on
6721920	6727520	to it what but you didn't kill vampire no he's kind of a George for part of our
6727520	6739000	team I say we let him like I just think I just you're an outlier an outlier I
6739000	6752160	don't know all right here's the gym thank you but it's not a it's do you
6752160	6755440	understand it's not for comedy it's like we've been looking for it for a long
6755440	6760240	time what do you why would it be for comedy if we've been I just put it in my
6760240	6765000	leaf I know it's just not a bit like I don't use it to be made of bits like I
6765000	6771920	don't know like I'm giving a gem to a guy that's like made of bits bits of
6771920	6776800	comedy I don't know I did do you even have pockets like like like you're you're
6776800	6779760	like I'm a shambling mound I have pockets of
6779760	6792080	here what's in your pockets take it what's in your pocket no wait take it
6792080	6799320	take it back since you know I don't want it fine it's on the ground great I pick
6799320	6805360	it up and put it in my glass jar okay Aaron is this how you play D&D this is
6805360	6808440	how you do it well there's always the one guy who picks everything up and puts
6808440	6812520	it in a glass jar and the audience everything yeah okay all right so do we
6812520	6818560	need I mean I it was in your pockets thank you leaves more leaves how many
6818560	6824040	pockets of leaves do you have all of them I don't know I just a big pocket of
6824040	6828000	leaves yeah what so why do you have pockets of leaves this is what are what
6828000	6834600	okay you know I let's just move on from this he's got it I thought I you know I
6834600	6838880	thought you know you appreciated what I did but you didn't so it doesn't matter
6838880	6842240	it doesn't matter you don't have to appreciate no we need to do we need to
6842240	6848400	find patterns and return this gem to Patchens what a great question why were
6848400	6852960	you finding Patchens Jim do you guys remember well because we felt guilty
6852960	6858760	because we got waylaid by bandits on the road and they took Patchens Jim right
6858760	6863480	and so you're getting it for him yeah so we so we have to get this back to
6863480	6867560	Patchens well that's up to you but yeah kind of yeah I mean all right let's
6867560	6871600	let's go find Patchens okay so last time you saw Patchens he was in the town
6871600	6874840	before it caught fire all right let's go let's go back to town is probably the
6874840	6878800	fire is probably out by now it's not you can see it from the farm but it's still
6878800	6883280	going all right well let's let's let's go let's go sneak into town there's
6883280	6886800	probably a big commotion going on how did the fire start wait do we have any
6886800	6891760	enemies that are still outstanding well the whole town yeah yeah but it's it's
6891760	6895320	sort of like it's I mean they're okay they're dealing with shit all right so
6895320	6899440	should we just let that sort itself out yeah I don't know sometimes I hear true
6899440	6903120	crime podcast or it's like you know someone disappears on 9 10 and then it's
6903120	6908480	like you know like like it's it's part of the fucking thing it's like then 9 11
6908480	6912760	happened and then like I'm saying like they're undergoing a thing in that town
6912760	6917360	right now where we could they we could probably relax the law a little bit like
6917360	6921680	we don't like you say we go back and we don't go back I'm saying we go back I'm
6921680	6925760	saying I'm afraid no need for disguises I'm pretty sure all right people have
6925760	6929080	their hands full I feel comfortable
6930080	6935560	TVs on our way in yeah yeah how far away is the town can we see um you're
6935560	6938760	technically in the town you're just under like the farming so we're already
6938760	6942920	here yeah but it's like the fire is on the other side of the town so that's why
6942920	6948040	you can see it and you're not like in a fire right now okay all right let's go
6948040	6953240	walk in and start our pachins hunt yeah okay just look around for yeah or
6953240	6960320	shambled around for him thank you don't you have a little song that you'd say
6960320	6968000	when you shambled I'm Gary shambling mouth and shambling through this side of
6968000	6978400	town it's on fire all right so we're walking through the town Spencer you're
6978400	6982120	walking through the town and most of the people aren't around it's it's kind of
6982120	6986360	night and so it's like late night but everyone you can hear a commotion coming
6986360	6989160	from the fire it seems like everyone's working together to try to put out the
6989160	6995680	fire you can't quite see him because you're still like there's Rosa houses
6995680	6998640	and buildings that are interposing why don't we go act like let's go lend a
6998640	7003200	hand let's let's like play ball with these people okay or what it's a little
7003200	7009440	sociopathic we could be the town's heroes we could win back their favor
7009440	7012600	excuse me all right well maybe it's a good way to look for pachins how they
7012600	7016020	putting out how are they putting out the fire with like sand you can't see
7016020	7019680	because you know let's go check it out does the town have a well yeah it has a
7019680	7023440	well I'm gonna run to the well look for a bucket okay you run to the well and
7023440	7026320	there's no buckets there's a hole like what do you call it like a citizen's
7026320	7029640	ladder they're they're stationed from the well all the way to the fire and
7029640	7035120	they're very engaged in passing water can I help oh yeah they they look at you
7035120	7039440	and then wave you over and immediately insinuate you into their lines there
7039440	7043640	this town is quick this it's it's such a crisis that they're okay with a bear
7043640	7049840	coming in no Bernie Mac any point in a storm just to be Bernie Mac is a fixture
7049840	7054880	around town okay all right town master could you bear some more help
7054880	7060320	everyone's laughing they're fucking loving this shit he's but he's not the
7060320	7065320	bear that was in charge of fire prevention right because no different
7065320	7069000	bear right now because I'm smoking the bear showed up to like help put out a
7069120	7077440	fire I'd be like fuck you where were you this shouldn't have happened am I
7077440	7080160	immune to fire Spencer because I have all these fire things you have some
7080160	7085080	resistance yeah I mean like maybe I can put my fire abilities to use here yeah
7085080	7089600	I mean fight fire with fire that is what started the fight right I've heard that
7089600	7096120	extent okay I go I go everybody just everybody keep doing what you doing I
7096120	7100160	walk up and I say I'm not a big scientist I work for the Church of the
7100160	7108240	silver flame but I go up to a building on fire and I shoot fire and a ring
7108240	7114680	around the fire to consume oxygen around it and smother the fire what spell is
7114680	7123120	that produce flame produce flame not enough fire you can try that okay hang on
7123120	7129720	give me god damn it so can he control the fire with his powers produce flame
7129720	7133560	no I mean a little tiny bit like control fire is a different spell if I understand
7133560	7138840	do you okay I do this it's kind of it's kind of it's kind of a trick I do produce
7138840	7143720	flame so I have a fireball I can create a fireball in my hand right yeah yes so
7143720	7147800	I go I'm gonna get rid of this fire my way and I go in and I get close to the
7147800	7152080	fire and then produce a flame and then run off with it and throw it down
7152080	7163280	the well I see I keep running back and forth and just like I'm digging a hole
7163280	7175440	he's he's a centrist right that's what they call him right yeah donut you're
7175440	7181800	almost immediately recognized as the guy who started the fire remember that
7181800	7188920	what happens what are they saying um they start pointing you out because
7188920	7193040	you're kind of running fast and they're all very busy so but you start to notice
7193040	7196080	people who aren't involved in firefighting start to cluster and
7196080	7202640	accumulate around you I quietly walk backward away from him all right the
7202640	7208440	only person with the with the rapport with the town exits the situation I
7208560	7215560	think that's a smart move all right so yeah it looks like people are sizing you
7215560	7222800	up maybe to like attack you or like to call the police or something
7222800	7227200	these times of trial by fire that we must consult the silver flames
7227200	7234320	teachings on the matter for non silver flame is always the result of friction
7234320	7241560	and friction comes from fear of fire such that fire will consume the earth if
7241560	7247840	the silver flame is not acquiesced to and what is the silver flame but love
7247840	7255760	acceptance acquiescence water even is more silver flame II than orange flame
7255760	7263160	II I sneak to the back of the crowd while while he's talking I don't that
7263360	7270400	sounds like a pretty good idea I like what he's saying give him a chance to
7270400	7276400	talk you uh you're a great distraction and everyone turns to look at you
7276400	7280240	because you're a giant monster trying to like pretend to be various nondescript
7280240	7286280	people it doesn't mean I don't know your neighbor whoever you live near be they
7286280	7293640	bear or a shambling mound or a human or out-of-towner or a mischievous darting
7293640	7299600	flame wizard person all of us must work together in a war worth fighting you
7299600	7303040	will find yourselves shoulder to shoulder with those you mistrust or
7303040	7308680	else the war is no war at all for it is the real orange flame that we must put
7308680	7315640	out now with love and accepting everyone absolutely unconditionally fires the
7315640	7320840	real enemy fires the real enemy something's not actively on fire it's
7320840	7327280	not worth paying attention to at this particular time your other conflicts
7327280	7332200	will keep you could you could jump on somebody and say hey you offended me
7332200	7339280	that was micro aggressive after we beat these Nazis there's a town on fire
7339280	7350480	water water isn't that that seems like the opposite of what you were saying up
7350480	7357320	till that point I may have digressed as Carlos was giving a speech I'm I'm
7357320	7360880	sneaking around the crowd trying to see if I can find passions in the crowd all
7360880	7365880	right you're still pretty recognizable so I'm also looking around though and
7365880	7369720	everybody likes me so yeah yeah everyone's loving it to create a
7369720	7373760	distraction I go to the center of everybody I throw my shield down kick
7373760	7377320	out my sword and just start doing the craziest fucking dance I could think of
7377320	7384640	there are now five distractions hey look at that guy dance how about a sixth you
7384640	7388840	hear the pounding of hook beats on pavement the familiar sound of a horse
7388840	7393840	with a rider and on that horse you hear a voice ring out a familiar voice from a
7393840	7398440	grizzled old man oh this is what happens to those who spurn the flames
7398440	7403480	light it's Geffen he's wearing brown armor and he's wheeled in a big flaming
7403480	7407440	mace and he's bashing it into wooden structures and setting fires well
7407440	7413400	extensions and dragons fans will remember Geffen from episode 241
7413400	7420520	Excelsior refresh my memory on Geffen he's just a guy you know okay is he is
7420520	7424640	friend or foe he's a he's a friend generally he feels like he toes the line
7424640	7431400	though oh doesn't it was my friends with Patchens no he doesn't he knows who
7431400	7436440	Patchens is but anyway he's like lighting more fires and he he rides his horse
7436440	7440040	through the line of volunteer firemen and smashes one in the head with a
7440040	7445720	flaming mace oh this is what happens to those who spurn the flames light all
7445720	7450920	right all right damn you flash back to a moment on your prior campaign of the
7450920	7455800	Eldine reaches when you and Geffen were also lighting villages on fire but now
7455800	7461080	you feel worse about it because like it seems fucked up like in the present
7461080	7472520	yeah this is like what you used to be doing but you know it was a good thing
7472520	7474840	when you were doing it back then and now it's like you don't like that it's
7474840	7484120	happening all right hey Geffen come on I heard you preaching is that not what
7484120	7491400	you were doing you wanted more fire no fuck he rides off you were doing that
7491400	7495720	because it no no he doesn't sorry he doesn't he doesn't write off that's
7495720	7502040	funny is he really doing it because of me well yeah because you know you might
7502040	7504760	not remember this about your character but you used to be like this fucked up
7504760	7509800	guy who did a lot of shitty shit I still am yeah and so like no so like
7509800	7513960	this guy was a partner in crime you know he's like your your foil maybe I don't
7513960	7520520	know you know I but I was trying to make a distinction between the real fire you
7520520	7525880	know and the silver flame which is actually not real fire well it hits the
7525880	7530760	fire is very real it's inflame key I know the fire is very real but the kind
7530760	7534200	that needs to be put out is not the kind that you use to put it out which is the
7534600	7538600	flame of faith it's just I was trying to split a hair to get my friends from
7538600	7546120	being arrested and Geffen bad time for the for the gaffer
7547160	7552840	and get Geffen dial it back
7554360	7561480	well now he rides off okay all right sorry that's no need to apologize
7561480	7568200	weird what a weird yeah I call out because now the jig is up anyway I call
7568200	7574200	out patches all right we did commit it now I'm thinking well yeah why am I
7574200	7578280	trying to be a good person well I thought I thought you said we were the
7578280	7584760	good guys well maybe that's like not what this town deserves
7587000	7590200	and it seems like everything we do we end up being the bad guys
7590200	7594280	okay I just I'm just starting to think I'm remembering my previous life with
7594280	7597240	Geffen and I'm like oh yeah yeah actually we were good at one thing
7599320	7605560	burning towns and murdering people making people understand that it was god that was doing it to
7605560	7612600	them so we should instead of trying to put the fire out we should fight fire with fire
7612760	7615240	oh okay I like fire
7617640	7620840	he said he likes it he doesn't say he likes it oh yeah yeah
7623240	7627320	I mean are you applying as a dungeon master have I had a change of heart or are you just saying
7627320	7632280	that was my understanding is that you met like Steve and Jeff and you're like we're this is not
7632280	7637080	what the church is for I'm the right person and I'm gonna change the church from the inside okay
7637080	7641640	well that's cool that's an arc I mean that's why so then I hope so that's the fact the fact that
7641640	7647160	we keep doing this is is fine it's forgivable and it's actually just admirable that I don't
7647160	7653480	want to do it anymore did Geffen really write off yeah I mean he seemed kind of embarrassed but also
7653480	7658600	like he really enjoyed it and was kind of like you look bad in front of you by like doing the
7658600	7662600	wrong thing but he thought it was the right you know does he really respect me that much no he
7662600	7668440	just thought that it was killing time oh and he really bases that on me well he heard you preaching
7668440	7671400	he might not have heard you he might have heard you about as good as I was listening
7673080	7678520	which uh which I apparently misinterpreted some of your words and saw you were uh inciting
7678520	7684120	violence wait but you but you but you also thought that I was my arc was that I was becoming better
7684120	7688280	that I wanted to be better so then didn't you think it was odd that I was preaching to burn the town
7688920	7693640	um that's what it seemed like but I thought you were being a distraction like I don't didn't think
7693640	7697240	you were earnest about it you were just like trying to be distracting I didn't get that you
7697240	7700840	wanted to burn the town down you was talking about how great fire was that's what you wanted
7700840	7705240	you would purify it with the fire of righteousness I'm not saying that I heard him accurately I'm
7705240	7710280	saying I didn't hear that I thought I thought I thought you were about to get lynched and then
7710280	7715960	he was coming in to just to stop him you know what real fire would do fire would fight fire
7715960	7720120	and understand that people that look like they started the fire are probably just uh firefighters
7720120	7726040	so that's what happened 10 minutes ago yeah it was probably 15 minutes ago probably 15
7726120	7729720	yeah can we attack something yeah yeah awesome you can attack the people
7731160	7734440	no uh there's no real monsters attack these waffles
7739160	7744440	yeah patches not around god damn it has anyone seen patches are there any buildings not on fire
7744440	7750440	uh yeah shroves house let's go there let's go check inside yeah the barren shambling
7750440	7755640	mound go to shroves house you go to shroves house it's empty no one's home I just want to hang
7755640	7761160	behind and say my brothers and sisters that aren't fighting the fire I am on a quest for
7761160	7767880	the church of the silver flame has anyone seen patches god no one's really paying too close
7767880	7771720	attention to you they're like attending to the wounded and dead and fighting fire of the many
7772360	7777880	sins that people can commit against the silver flame is being distracted one must focus on
7777880	7781320	what's important gethian comes back I try to get no no no no
7783480	7786200	is gethian it's like my Tyler Durden he just shows up
7789320	7797160	hey Carlos you want their attention you want their attention I yes do you want I mean yeah
7797160	7801480	no no I don't I mean on a human level what are you planning to do are we low on time by the way
7801480	7805320	or are we going to get kicked off stage sorry yeah we have like two minutes okay sorry everybody
7805960	7807240	the red coats come at uh
7811080	7815000	yeah no we like doing the show yeah we're we're having a great time
7816760	7822760	you would eventually become as bored as us believe me we're having fun so Geffen's back no no that
7822760	7828840	was a good joke that was a great joke all right what what are you trying to you I just wanted to
7828840	7836600	find out where Patchett's is yeah me too Patchett's but he's not he's not he's not here Patchett's
7836600	7843160	I thought I would engage them and they're making a religious thing they're looking for anything
7843160	7849160	that will put out fire I'm a cleric so I thought water like be religious and ask for patch sand
7849160	7853800	but he said but he said they're not going to pay attention to you because they're too busy putting
7853800	7858680	the fire out I found that out do we find anything you find a bag that looks like it has water
7858680	7867240	symbols on it a bag yeah like okay hey hey Bernie bag with water symbols on it what do you think it's
7867240	7878200	a bag of water okay let's go I ride Bernie Mac into back to town waving this bag with water
7878200	7890520	symbols on it going this is the breeders this is the breeders album
7895720	7901880	and okay so so you're flailing around the bag and like drops of water and like water spilling
7901880	7906440	out of it like it's like a full bucket or something I go wow hey Bernie I'm gonna start
7906520	7908840	spinning it do you think you could run in a circle
7910360	7916200	absolutely okay let's give it a shot I started whipping around around right yeah around the fire
7916200	7920440	right whipping it around you know let's pick a building just one building first and try it
7920440	7926040	you're you're steering man I'm whipping I'm whipping it around I'm whipping it around
7926040	7933160	right and we're doing percentage-wise how good of a job uh not great the bag is like tied off and
7933160	7941400	so it's not really okay okay that's a good idea I untie the bag and then we start again running
7941400	7947000	around building up your choice you're waving it around now with the bag untied with the symbols
7947000	7951400	on it okay it's crazy magic it's like you're holding the fullest bucket everywhere and every
7951480	7953720	motion just splashes boards of water
7962920	7970520	how many like like let's say we do 30 laps yeah okay so does that put out the fire yeah it takes
7970520	7975960	about 10 minutes but you put out the building on fire okay one feeling down yeah you freed up a lot
7975960	7982200	of a lot of like real estate for for firefighters to stand right right okay okay all right next
7982200	7986760	building we do the same thing
