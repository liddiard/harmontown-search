0	8420	Oh shit! Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California!
8420	25000	Harman Town is now in session! Spencer Drayton, your Dungeon Master! Spencer!
25000	34000	And the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
34000	43000	Thank you! Thank you very much!
43000	48000	Alright, so I threw out my back yesterday.
48000	49000	For real?
49000	54000	Yeah, and it hurts a lot, and it's hard to walk.
54000	58000	And today, Aaron drew a bath for me.
58000	63000	And it's my wife, Aaron.
63000	70000	It wasn't Aaron Sorkin.
70000	72000	I asked him.
72000	74000	That's a better story.
74000	78000	His take on it would be too dramatic.
78000	81000	Too clever. Just draw me a bath.
81000	84000	What would an Aaron Sorkin bath look like?
84000	87000	It would be ironic.
87000	91000	It would have a picture of a desert above it. I don't know.
91000	95000	I don't improvise what Aaron Sorkin's style is.
95000	101000	So she runs me a bath, very nice. She puts all these Epsom salts in it.
101000	104000	Maybe this will help your bad back.
104000	107000	And she's like, do you want me to put some music on it?
107000	109000	She puts something on it.
109000	115000	And she puts on probably in a genuine attempt to make me feel comfortable.
115000	120000	Not mockingly, she puts on 90s alternative hits.
120000	126000	It says like a station.
126000	131000	I'm like, this does make me comfortable with 90s alternative hits.
131000	134000	It's soothing my back and some Epsom salts.
134000	136000	It's like a radio station.
136000	140000	And then the commercial on the radio station for the 90s alternative hits
140000	147000	is for a hospital that specializes in hip pain.
147000	151000	And that's a real actual thing that happened today.
151000	153000	This is sitting there in the tub.
153000	156000	And then another thing that made me feel old but in a good way
156000	158000	was I watched Kung Fury.
158000	161000	Did you see this thing, Kung Fury?
161000	166000	That was another Woody and Toy Story moment for me.
166000	169000	The box opening and Kung Fury coming out and me going,
169000	173000	oh, I'm retiring now.
173000	176000	It's kind of, not to be, I guess that's very presumptuous for me to say.
176000	178000	There's a lot of talent and passion.
178000	180000	You got to check it out. It's very great.
180000	185000	It's like 25 minutes of just nonstop passion for the 80s.
185000	189000	I would never have clicked on it because there's been so much hack shit
189000	192000	that has like, you know, Kung in the title.
192000	195000	It just sounds like something you probably nine times out of ten.
195000	198000	Kung Fu Panda.
198000	200000	You know, it's just too much shit.
200000	203000	Somebody sends me a video and goes like, oh, you should watch this.
203000	205000	It's called Kung Fury. I'm not going to, I'm not.
205000	207000	I just, I did it because of my bad back, really.
207000	210000	I couldn't do anything else except watch stuff.
210000	212000	So I clicked on it and then I was just drawn in.
212000	214000	And it's really, really good.
214000	216000	All you have to do is give it 30 seconds
216000	219000	and you're either going to watch the full 25 or not.
219000	221000	But it's really good.
221000	224000	It was kind of a coming of age day, I think, for that reason.
224000	227000	Because it's very, it's like a celebration of 80s VHS,
227000	230000	direct-to-video kind of action films.
230000	233000	But simultaneously, it's like taking advantage of today's technology.
233000	239000	It was kickstarted by someone who appears to be probably a younger man.
239000	242000	I've never seen him before.
242000	247000	It just felt, the obsolescence, my obsolescence emanating off of this thing.
247000	254000	I texted Shrob and said, man, I'm really glad this guy waited to show up
254000	258000	until after you and I were validated.
258000	261000	Because if I had been in the break room at Target and seen that,
261000	264000	I would have gotten into my car, driven to the desert,
264000	269000	stopped at the first cow skull,
269000	272000	and just gotten out and just started walking.
272000	275000	And I either would have faded down on me walking
275000	280000	or I would have just dissolved like Ice Cube and Boys in the Hood.
280000	283000	Meaning I died, I guess.
283000	288000	Ice Cube died, right? That's why he faded away.
288000	291000	Is that a yup? Is that Dave Klein?
291000	293000	Hey, Dave Klein.
293000	295000	He brought his yups to the...
295000	298000	Sitting in the sweetspot with a camera for the home listener,
298000	300000	one of them is pointed right at Dave Klein.
300000	304000	Oh, that's right. It's a Klein cam.
304000	308000	Dan, under what circumstances did you hurt your back?
308000	311000	I think I was just like, it takes very little.
311000	314000	I've had a bad back since I was 17.
314000	318000	I come from a long line of bad backs and I do.
318000	322000	I mean, everyone in my family has a fucked up back.
322000	325000	I'd pick it off of a list of things that could be fucked up about me.
325000	328000	I don't want asthma. I don't want certain allergies.
328000	330000	I'll take a bad back.
330000	334000	But it makes it really hard to do physical labor.
334000	336000	That's the big downside.
336000	339000	Boo-hoo.
339000	343000	But sometimes if I do too much twisting and bending,
343000	346000	I was rearranging my office and I think I just did
346000	348000	a certain combination of things.
348000	350000	And then I tried to get on my inversion table.
350000	355000	I have this Michael Keaton gravity boot thing that usually knocks it out.
355000	357000	But this time maybe I did it wrong or something.
357000	360000	And then I was like, ow, ow, ow, ow.
360000	363000	And I couldn't even play video games. It hurt so bad.
363000	364000	Oh my God.
364000	366000	Because that involves sitting up.
366000	367000	You couldn't sit down?
367000	370000	I can barely be standing here. I'm a hero for standing here.
370000	373000	Thank you.
373000	374000	Yeah.
374000	379000	Let's see a firefighter do this.
379000	384000	Take some time off his jeans stealing schedule.
384000	388000	These guys can't stop stealing jeans.
388000	390000	That's why they become firefighters.
390000	392000	They're like, hmm, free jeans.
392000	395000	If you're a firefighter and this is your first episode,
395000	398000	it's a callback.
398000	403000	I don't believe you stole jeans during 9-11.
403000	405000	I know that's an urban myth.
405000	408000	It's an urban myth that entertains me.
408000	410000	I'm calling back to the joke.
410000	416000	There's also an urban myth that firefighters come to our podcast.
416000	423000	Or they're out there watching on their little fireproof laptops.
423000	429000	Have you seen the Little Caesar commercial where the...
429000	432000	Little Caesars has this ad for this guy.
432000	434000	This is related to laptops.
434000	437000	Little Caesars has this guy because Little Caesars is doing this campaign
437000	447000	to convince you that their pizza is easier than ordering online.
447000	449000	They're doing these commercials where it's like,
449000	451000	yeah, man, this is so much easier.
451000	456000	They're vilifying the process of ordering pizza online.
456000	459000	I don't know. How do they think that that's going to...
459000	462000	One of the commercials I saw today, because I have a bad back,
462000	464000	I was just watching Key and Peele all day
464000	466000	and watching these shitty commercials.
466000	470000	There's a guy who goes like, hey, can I get two pizzas?
470000	472000	And his hands are below the counter.
472000	475000	And she goes, yeah, that'll be whatever, fucking 99 or whatever.
475000	477000	And he goes, thanks.
477000	480000	You have no idea how much easier it is than ordering online.
480000	482000	And he lifts his hands.
482000	484000	So he's lifting his hands,
484000	493000	and both of his hands have been thrust through the backside of computer monitors
493000	500000	on laptops because it wouldn't read otherwise as a laptop.
500000	504000	The idea is he's been so frustrated with his computers
504000	507000	and such a pussy that he had to sneak up on him.
507000	511000	He's like, I'll be right back.
511000	514000	No, it's because obviously they're in the production meeting
514000	520000	and they're like, oh, but all laptops just look like slabs of nothingness from behind.
520000	522000	Oh, well, we'll just turn around.
522000	524000	Julie, can we just turn around?
524000	527000	Yeah, yeah, just give me a second. We'll turn around.
527000	530000	Nobody was like, the actor's like, I don't fucking care.
530000	532000	I'm in a pizza commercial.
532000	535000	I already want to kill myself.
535000	537000	I'm not going to argue with these people.
537000	540000	I'm not going to be the actor that had to do a pizza commercial
540000	543000	and was high maintenance about it.
543000	546000	I'm just going to do this and I'm going to get out of here.
546000	551000	The idea being that he tried to order online and his hands went through a computer.
551000	557000	I'm assuming that the idea is that he was trying to order a pizza online and couldn't.
557000	561000	And then he told his computer to turn around.
561000	564000	Look over there.
564000	566000	I mean, the idea is that he would have punched in frustration,
566000	570000	but it looks like his computer was so ashamed that it couldn't order pizza for him
570000	576000	that it went down to the river like Lenny of mice and men.
576000	582000	And he sympathetically, euthanistically dispatched it.
582000	587000	And he's just saying to the lady, like, it's much easier to go through Little Caesars.
587000	596000	So then during Key and Peel, which is awesome, I saw a bunch of Key and Spielberg sketches that I have.
596000	599000	This is nice when you go through a spate of not watching Key and Peel.
599000	603000	You get to catch up with a lot of those guys who really go for it.
604000	606000	We should have one or both of them on the show.
606000	610000	He said flag-rently.
610000	612000	Yup, we got a yup on that.
612000	614000	Do we have a yup?
614000	616000	The yups have it.
616000	619000	Yeah, but it probably has to be one of them.
619000	621000	They hate each other.
621000	623000	They won't work together.
623000	624000	No, that's kid in play.
624000	625000	Oh, that's right, that's right.
625000	629000	Wow.
629000	632000	No, but they did voices.
632000	633000	Was he right?
633000	636000	Did you confuse kid playing with the joke maybe?
636000	642000	No, you just confused my joke for realsies.
642000	648000	You're seeing double and one thing is the joke and for realsies are separate because you're seeing double.
648000	651000	So you're looking at the for realsies.
651000	658000	Focus on the joke half of your vision.
659000	670000	They did voices for Rick and Morty, which Adult Swim didn't want us to talk about all the guest voices,
670000	677000	but like 20% of our second season is leaked online, so you already know that they did voices.
677000	680000	Unless you're one of these wonderful people who...
680000	682000	I appreciate the sacrifice.
682000	684000	I think people are tweeting me going,
684000	688000	the episodes are leaked, the two episodes that we sent out to press are leaked of Rick and Morty,
688000	692000	and I'm not going to watch them until the date.
692000	694000	I'd be with you, I think.
694000	699000	I don't fault anybody for doing it, but I don't care about the politics of it.
699000	707000	I would just say from on Justin's behalf that we'd rather be finished with the episodes when you watch them,
707000	710000	and we'd rather you see them with the sound mixed and stuff like that.
710000	711000	We're doing it for Justin.
711000	713000	All right, good.
713000	715000	Hashtag.
717000	721000	And there was another commercial during the Key in Peels.
721000	729000	Okay, so I'm 42, so a lot of this show is about me being open and honest about my racially obsessed 70s upbringing,
729000	736000	the brain that's resulted in like I'm struggling with a post-racial millennial generation,
737000	744000	and I think the second half of a proper life should be spent realizing how wrong you were for the first half,
744000	745000	and I'm loving it.
745000	747000	That's what the show's about to a large degree.
747000	748000	I'm going to therapy now.
748000	755000	You heard me swear off therapy, and I'm never going to like giraffes, but...
755000	758000	So I'm confused about this one.
758000	762000	So I'm watching Key in Peel, and then this McDonald's commercial comes on.
762000	765000	I thought we stopped doing this.
765000	768000	I thought this was like an 80s, 90s thing,
768000	773000	and then we got embarrassed about the transparency of it and stopped doing it.
773000	775000	Maybe this is post now.
775000	777000	Now it's like, well, why not do it?
777000	782000	It's just like we're still doing the wrapping all black people McDonald's commercials,
782000	785000	the separate but equal McDonald's commercials,
785000	789000	where it's just all black people, and the announcer's black,
789000	793000	and everyone's black, and everyone's unified by blackness and loving McDonald's,
794000	796000	and I can't figure out how I feel about it anymore,
796000	799000	because we used to unilaterally go, well, this is ridiculous.
799000	805000	This is a holdover from a time when we thought that race separated people
805000	807000	and that advertisers were catering to it,
807000	809000	and now I have no idea how to feel about it,
809000	812000	because they're clearly like, I mean, they're young and beautiful,
812000	817000	and if I was part of a stereotype that made me look sexy
817000	821000	and have a good time all the time while I was eating my cheeseburgers,
821000	824000	and I saw the commercial, I might go like, well, now I want a cheeseburger.
824000	827000	Now that you're telling me white people do their white thing
827000	831000	and part of being white is looking good and jamming out.
831000	836000	It's just like, it comes out, it's like 250 for a burger and fry,
836000	839000	double, double, double fry, fry, double, double fry.
839000	842000	It makes no bones about it.
842000	844000	It's not disguising it anymore.
844000	845000	It's back to the 80s.
845000	846000	80s was like that.
846000	848000	They would just have a commercial.
848000	850000	It was just fucking like crazy.
850000	853000	It was like, yo, you want to get a burger cake?
853000	854000	Whopper, a whopper?
854000	859000	If you please, I would a whopper whopper with all my cheese.
859000	862000	And it was just black people just biting into burgers,
862000	863000	and they're just like, huh.
863000	865000	And it's just like there's an elephant in the room.
865000	867000	It's just like, hey, your race is different,
867000	870000	but you should buy our product anyway.
870000	875000	And so then I think in the 90s it got a little more subtle maybe.
876000	879000	Someone told me about, have you seen this commercial?
879000	882000	I think we must have talked about this commercial on this podcast.
882000	885000	The Coors, I think it's a Coors Light commercial,
885000	887000	the silver bullet people, right?
887000	888000	So there's this commercial.
888000	890000	We had to have talked about this.
890000	892000	The commercial opens up.
892000	895000	This is the 21st century that this commercial is.
895000	900000	There's like courthouse steps or just like skyscraper steps,
900000	904000	and a multi-ethnic group of young executives comes out.
904000	907000	And they're like, they just finished work on their own suits,
907000	911000	and they're kind of congratulating each other on a job well done
911000	913000	for capitalism that day.
913000	919000	And the Asian lady walks off, and the white guy goes his way,
919000	923000	and there's probably a Latino guy, although we're lagging there.
923000	928000	But at any rate, we follow the black guy,
928000	930000	the handsome young black executive.
930000	934000	And then it goes to a special train station that he goes to.
934000	939000	And I think it's all black people on the train platform.
939000	942000	And then the Coors Light silver bullet train pulls up,
942000	946000	and it opens up, and inside is a crazy black party
946000	951000	on like a Buck Rogers set with dry ice and holograms
951000	954000	and just all black people just grooving out,
954000	957000	drinking Coors Light, and he gets in it, and it just goes away.
957000	959000	And it's like, hey, you're black.
959000	960000	You have a secret life.
960000	962000	Make our beverage a part of it.
962000	964000	Like, why not?
969000	972000	How do we feel about this?
972000	974000	I mean, I guess it's not how do we feel about it.
974000	976000	It's how does the average...
976000	979000	It sounds like the commercial is targeted strictly at an audience.
979000	981000	It goes, yeah, you're a black guy.
981000	983000	It's cool to be a black gal or a guy.
983000	986000	Like, eat a cheeseburger, have a Coors Light.
986000	989000	We certainly don't want to live in a world where anything's against the law,
989000	993000	but we're just talking about what's respectful.
993000	996000	There should be a commercial where the black guy leaves,
996000	1000000	the multi-ethnic capitalists, goes down a secret train platform,
1000000	1005000	gets on an all-black dry ice train, and then a white guy gets on the train.
1005000	1007000	And everyone's like, oh, shit!
1007000	1010000	Everyone stops for a second, and then he holds up a Coors Light,
1010000	1012000	and they're like, yeah!
1017000	1019000	Exactly.
1019000	1022000	I think it's like...
1022000	1025000	What's the messaging there?
1027000	1031000	We know you know about the black secret lifestyle.
1031000	1033000	Make this beverage part of it.
1033000	1035000	Yeah, and so their slogan is Coors Light.
1035000	1037000	Is he cool?
1042000	1044000	The funny thing is that as a TV writer,
1045000	1047000	the line doesn't seem crystal clear to me,
1047000	1052000	but I'm more forgiving of that when it's not an advertising,
1052000	1055000	I guess because advertising all seems toxic.
1055000	1060000	I don't blink at a black sitcom,
1060000	1064000	like the idea of a nice blue collar.
1064000	1066000	He's a working man, and he's got a family,
1066000	1070000	and of course you don't have to diversify your all-black cast.
1071000	1073000	I just swallow that all down and go,
1073000	1074000	well, yeah, what else are we doing?
1074000	1075000	Who cares?
1075000	1076000	What the fuck?
1076000	1078000	Try to reflect life and try to cater to an audience.
1078000	1080000	But when McDonald's does an all-black commercial...
1080000	1082000	Somehow it makes me feel...
1082000	1084000	I guess because all commercials are already
1084000	1086000	even just a regular Pringles commercial
1086000	1089000	with a rainbow cast of people not popping or stopping
1089000	1092000	or whatever they do in the librarian scene.
1092000	1095000	They're popping and not stopping.
1095000	1098000	No flavor in this library!
1099000	1101000	What's going on?
1101000	1105000	Whose juice is having flavor in the library?
1105000	1107000	Ooh!
1107000	1109000	Titties.
1109000	1112000	Glasses off, titties.
1112000	1113000	Because fuck women.
1113000	1115000	Fuck them.
1115000	1120000	I am so offended by the racial non-homogeny
1120000	1124000	in the commercials, but hey, if you want to sell me a beer,
1124000	1126000	put it right between a pair of titties
1126000	1128000	of any color, really,
1128000	1133000	because I don't see things through that lens.
1133000	1136000	I'll look at a big, round pair of fake titties
1136000	1138000	of any color.
1138000	1142000	I'm progressive.
1142000	1145000	What is going on?
1145000	1148000	Go on.
1148000	1151000	I don't know, yeah, I don't know.
1151000	1154000	When you see an all-black McDonald's commercial,
1154000	1157000	what is your instinct?
1157000	1159000	What is your reaction to that?
1159000	1161000	I go, Jesus, that's embarrassing and awkward.
1161000	1163000	That's fucked up.
1163000	1165000	Do you think a black person thinks that's embarrassing,
1165000	1167000	that they're being pandered to?
1167000	1169000	I don't know, and I'll tell you what we're not going to do.
1169000	1171000	We're not going to ask if there's a black person in the audience
1171000	1174000	and then bring them up and have them speak for all black people,
1174000	1176000	because I just don't know.
1176000	1178000	I don't know.
1178000	1180000	I'm talking about you.
1180000	1183000	I look at it, and I go, we talked about this last week
1183000	1187000	about how I confessed about my weird white perspective
1187000	1190000	on these issues that doesn't quite matter
1190000	1192000	and yet matters a lot,
1192000	1195000	should be reflected upon.
1195000	1197000	I don't know.
1197000	1199000	I don't know.
1199000	1201000	I don't know.
1201000	1203000	I don't know.
1203000	1205000	I don't know.
1205000	1207000	It matters a lot.
1207000	1209000	It should be reflected upon.
1209000	1211000	That's how my feelings matter.
1211000	1213000	It should be me looking at myself and going,
1213000	1216000	why does this make you feel this way?
1218000	1220000	The complicated thing is that all of my feelings
1220000	1222000	have to do with perception of the other.
1222000	1224000	When I see the commercial come on,
1224000	1228000	I immediately go, I think my first emotional impulse is,
1228000	1232000	if I were black, this would make me feel angry.
1232000	1234000	This would outrage me, yes.
1234000	1237000	This would make me feel, it would make me hate society, yes,
1237000	1240000	because I would be going, what do all these people have in common
1240000	1243000	and why is this corporation telling me,
1243000	1245000	why is this a hook?
1245000	1248000	Why are they considering my race to be,
1248000	1253000	and then simultaneously also saying that my race is necessarily,
1253000	1256000	of course it's fucking hip-hop music.
1256000	1258000	Of course it's, when the announcer is like,
1258000	1260000	he's not an uptight black guy.
1260000	1262000	They exist, but he's not like a,
1262000	1264000	it's like the voiceover role is like,
1264000	1267000	I don't know, the fucking voiceover guy on the McDonald's commercial is like,
1267000	1269000	hey, you know what time it is.
1269000	1272000	It's like, it's always got that oozing with fucking
1272000	1275000	nighttime DJ sexuality.
1275000	1278000	I don't know, on one hand I would be like,
1278000	1280000	Maybe that commercial is not targeted towards black people,
1280000	1282000	but to white people, like, oh shit.
1282000	1284000	That's actually a really good point,
1284000	1286000	because they're all very attractive black people,
1286000	1288000	and maybe the white person inside you is like,
1288000	1291000	fuck society, I'm going to do what black people do.
1292000	1294000	I'm so angry at white corporate America,
1294000	1296000	I'm going to go eat a fucking Big Mac,
1296000	1298000	with my thin little white lips.
1298000	1300000	Nibble, nibble, nibble, nibble.
1302000	1304000	Look at me, Ray Kroc.
1308000	1311000	Are you angry at White House?
1311000	1313000	Chicken McNuggets.
1316000	1318000	Anyways.
1318000	1320000	But there is another part of me though,
1320000	1323000	like I said, because it's not like,
1323000	1326000	it's not negative stereotypes in the commercial.
1326000	1330000	It's, you're fun, you're sexy, you're having a good time.
1330000	1331000	I don't know, it's weird.
1331000	1333000	I don't think anyone likes being defined.
1333000	1336000	I think if they had a commercial that said,
1336000	1339000	hey, you're blonde, come to McDonald's,
1339000	1341000	like, blondes have a good time.
1341000	1343000	You know how blondes are.
1343000	1345000	After work with my blonde friends,
1345000	1348000	I'm in the mood for one thing, Chicken McNuggets.
1349000	1351000	But so many commercials are all white people.
1351000	1354000	You don't feel that that's insulting to white people?
1354000	1357000	It's unanimously white people in a commercial?
1357000	1360000	I don't think you can insult white people.
1360000	1364000	I don't know how to do that, except to call them racist.
1366000	1369000	Mario at the drawing room, I'm giving him credit for that joke.
1369000	1372000	He said, because we were talking about race,
1372000	1375000	because I was in there.
1375000	1377000	And Mario, if you ever go to the drawing room,
1377000	1379000	there's that big guy, Mario, behind the bar.
1379000	1380000	He's Cuban, yeah.
1380000	1383000	And he goes, you know what they say about white people, Dan?
1383000	1384000	I said, no.
1384000	1387000	He's like, you can call them honky, cracker, peckerwood.
1387000	1390000	Just don't call them racist.
1390000	1391000	I was like, you're right.
1391000	1393000	That's the only thing that offends them.
1393000	1396000	They get all burnt out of shape.
1396000	1397000	I'd love to be called peckerwood.
1397000	1400000	That would be amazing.
1400000	1403000	It would make me feel struggle.
1403000	1407000	Yeah, I am a peckerwood.
1407000	1416000	Are you afraid of my wooden pecker?
1416000	1418000	You should be.
1418000	1425000	I will mortgage your house and then lie about it
1425000	1430000	and foreclose, because I am manipulative and racist
1430000	1433000	and I'm a peckerwood.
1433000	1434000	Careful.
1439000	1443000	What's the McDonald's commercial targeted just towards peckerwoods?
1444000	1445000	I don't know.
1449000	1453000	The knife holds hard because it curves to the left.
1457000	1460000	So you pick your three wood and you hold your breath
1460000	1465000	and you swing for the clouds, but you know that your stomach isn't empty.
1466000	1475000	I can't believe they got Bob Seeger to do that commercial.
1478000	1482000	Hey, tomorrow's Wednesday and as all white people know,
1482000	1485000	it's secret no work day.
1485000	1487000	So come to McDonald's.
1487000	1489000	There won't be any black people there.
1490000	1494000	And that commercial, what if one black guy walks in on that day?
1494000	1498000	And then he holds up at McDonald's and we're like, get in here.
1507000	1510000	So, all right.
1510000	1518000	So speaking of outrage, so I'm playing Arkham Knight on the Xbox.
1519000	1523000	Okay, so I've played all three of the Arkham games
1523000	1527000	and then realizing like, holy shit, Alfred as always is helping a lot.
1527000	1529000	He helps a lot, Alfred.
1529000	1531000	He's the point man.
1531000	1534000	He's like, sir, you should know that those fingerprints belong to someone.
1534000	1538000	So he's working a full-time job, like running prints
1538000	1541000	and going through crime databases and stuff.
1541000	1544000	And he does that in the movies too, so it's not just the video game.
1544000	1547000	It finally just occurred to me because I was playing Batman
1547000	1550000	and once again, Alfred is like, should I send the new batsuit, sir?
1550000	1551000	And I was like, thank you.
1551000	1554000	And he's like, you'll notice the Kevlar plating is a bit of a tweak.
1554000	1555000	And I'm like, yeah, thanks.
1555000	1559000	And then I'm like, okay, will there be anything else, sir?
1559000	1562000	And I was like, yeah, well, the sink is filling with dishes.
1562000	1567000	Like, you are a fucking butler.
1568000	1571000	We can't hire any more help because every time you touch a
1571000	1579000	goddamn Shakespeare head, the fucking bookcase turns into a scuba vehicle.
1579000	1580000	So we can't.
1580000	1586000	Me in this 900-room house with one guy, I just think Alfred must be pretty pissed off.
1586000	1593000	Talk about a guy that must spend his nights punching walls.
1593000	1596000	Because Batman comes home and goes, thank you.
1596000	1600000	And then Alfred's like, okay, well, he probably every night sends these big hints.
1600000	1604000	Like, well, if there's nothing else, then I guess I should, you know, while this was all going on,
1604000	1611000	while I was coming up with that antidote for the neurotoxin, I did, like, I forgot to sweep up the pantry.
1611000	1612000	So I guess I'll go do that.
1612000	1621000	And then Bruce Wayne's like, okay, cool.
1621000	1622000	He's his butler for real.
1622000	1624000	It's not like a fake thing.
1624000	1631000	Like, his boss is a guy who pretends to be a bat, but he can't even be a fake butler.
1631000	1632000	He's not even allowed.
1632000	1634000	Do you think maybe I could have an alter ego?
1634000	1637000	Maybe by day I'm not a fucking butler.
1637000	1638000	It's crazy.
1638000	1641000	White people have it hard.
1641000	1645000	Not on Wednesday.
1645000	1650000	You've been polishing Bruce Wayne's candelabra
1650000	1652000	and helping him fight poison ivy.
1652000	1664000	But your lips are smacking for that salty taste of a deep fried string of processed potato-like substance.
1664000	1665000	All right.
1665000	1668000	Hey, is Curtis here yet?
1668000	1669000	No?
1669000	1670000	Okay.
1670000	1671000	Fucking guy.
1671000	1672000	I'm telling you.
1672000	1673000	Stay nice.
1673000	1674000	Stay fucking nice.
1674000	1676000	You know we have no show other than that.
1676000	1677000	Spencer, how's it going?
1677000	1678000	Hey, guys.
1678000	1680000	I'm doing just good.
1680000	1681000	Let's...
1681000	1687000	Oh, so someone, I'd assume a fan of Harman Town sent me a Super Nintendo game.
1687000	1690000	I think an ominously it was Mega Man X3.
1690000	1692000	It's worth like a lot of money.
1692000	1697000	So I should have mentioned it weeks and weeks ago, but thank you very much.
1697000	1698000	Sorry.
1698000	1699000	Sorry, everybody.
1699000	1700000	Now to today.
1700000	1704000	I was driving by a place called Kabob Time.
1705000	1709000	I guess already you know the marketing's not very strong at this location.
1709000	1714000	But Kabob Time had to sign a subtitle, if you will, for the restaurant,
1714000	1716000	which I don't know if that's common.
1716000	1718000	I guess that's kind of common for restaurants.
1718000	1722000	But it said, no heartburn, exclamation point,
1722000	1726000	which is a very interesting tactic for advertising.
1726000	1728000	It's like you don't see that elsewhere.
1728000	1732000	Like Denny's not poison or like...
1732000	1734000	It's also totally irresponsible. They can't say that.
1734000	1738000	Yeah, that's completely down to your own constitution.
1738000	1741000	That's like that Yelp doctor saying you definitely have ADD.
1741000	1744000	Well, yeah, I mean, I guess it would be like if they were like,
1744000	1749000	no cancer or like something, like you can't determine these things.
1749000	1751000	Cancer's not a good place to go.
1751000	1753000	Found that out.
1753000	1756000	Hey, I have a new segment.
1759000	1760000	Do you?
1763000	1764000	It's called...
1764000	1767000	Dan, if you don't have a segment, don't worry about it.
1767000	1770000	It's called Uber Confessions.
1770000	1772000	Uber Confessions!
1775000	1778000	Yeah, sometimes you're in a car but you don't want to drive
1778000	1780000	because it's too far, or you're too drunk
1780000	1782000	so you have someone else drive you.
1782000	1784000	And they're Armenian.
1785000	1786000	Woo!
1791000	1793000	My first Uber confession...
1793000	1795000	I have two Uber Confessions tonight.
1795000	1800000	My first Uber confession is that every time someone drops me off
1800000	1802000	at my house and says,
1802000	1805000	you have a beautiful home, my first reaction?
1805000	1806000	Panic.
1807000	1809000	That's my first confession.
1809000	1811000	Value my candor, don't punish me for it.
1815000	1820000	My second Uber confession is that I just finally realized
1820000	1822000	I was looking down at the bottom tabs.
1822000	1826000	I've been using an American Express card to call Ubers
1826000	1831000	since I decided to not buy a car, which was a long time ago.
1831000	1834000	And I have been like fucking flat...
1834000	1838000	So there's a little tab down there with the American Express card
1838000	1841000	and it says, pay with this card.
1841000	1843000	And then I notice another tab next to it that says,
1843000	1845000	use points.
1845000	1846000	I'm like, use points?
1846000	1847000	I click on it.
1849000	1853000	I have 1.07 million membership rewards points.
1855000	1860000	Which translates to $10,766 worth of Uber rides.
1862000	1864000	Which means I...
1864000	1869000	I mean, I haven't done the math, but I can never get a car
1869000	1872000	because of all the money I've clearly blown on Uber now
1872000	1876000	means I'll be blowing even more money if I don't use all these points.
1876000	1878000	And those are my Uber confessions.
1883000	1885000	Yo, yo, smells like cologne in here.
1885000	1886000	Is there a button?
1886000	1888000	A no cologne button on the app, please?
1888000	1890000	A no cologne button?
1891000	1893000	Oh, now it smells like cigarettes.
1896000	1898000	A no cologne button, that would be good, right, buddy?
1899000	1902000	Like, you ever park your car with a valet
1902000	1905000	and you get in your car and the valet guy gets out
1905000	1909000	and it's just like, my car smells like your cologne for the rest of time.
1910000	1914000	That's an occupation where you should not be allowed to wear all the cologne.
1916000	1917000	Unregulated, man.
1917000	1918000	Here's my thing.
1918000	1921000	A flight attendant should not be able to wear all the perfume or cologne.
1921000	1924000	I was in a Southwest flight where a woman had so much cologne,
1925000	1928000	I moved to the back of the plane because I couldn't breathe
1928000	1931000	and I called the FAA and had her killed.
1933000	1935000	Which I thought was too far.
1939000	1941000	I did regret it.
1941000	1945000	Also, I lost my voice today cheering for the U.S. women's soccer team.
1951000	1953000	So, speaking of feminism,
1955000	1958000	Aaron hired a guy to clean out our garage today
1958000	1960000	because there's like a lot of...
1960000	1961000	That is feminist.
1963000	1964000	There's a lot of...
1964000	1968000	She's like the Gloria Steinem of hiring people.
1970000	1972000	The garage of my home is like...
1972000	1977000	The back and side walls are all dirt as high as the garage's roof.
1977000	1980000	It's kind of like an underground garage.
1981000	1984000	Years and years, the house was built in 1929.
1984000	1985000	Humblebrag.
1985000	1987000	Not a humblebrag, just a brag.
1991000	1994000	All the water has just been slowly seeping into the walls of the garage
1994000	1996000	and the thing's ready to fall apart.
1996000	2000000	So, Spencer helped me hire these landscaper guys.
2000000	2002000	Dig these trenches.
2002000	2004000	Anyways, that's not really important to the story.
2004000	2005000	I think it is.
2005000	2006000	We got the garage.
2007000	2008000	We got the garage, which always...
2008000	2011000	If you went in there and took a whiff,
2011000	2014000	you'd be like, I'm certainly gonna die of black mold.
2014000	2015000	Oh, by the way.
2015000	2016000	Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2016000	2017000	Wait.
2019000	2020000	Everybody get out.
2020000	2021000	Everyone get out.
2022000	2024000	If they can come back in, we're gonna start the show.
2025000	2026000	What was her name? The poor young lady.
2026000	2027000	The actress.
2029000	2030000	Brittany Murphy.
2030000	2031000	Do you guys read about that?
2031000	2032000	It wasn't as publicized.
2032000	2034000	I keep spitting on you, Willie.
2034000	2035000	You're in the splash zone.
2035000	2037000	It's just vodka for my mustache.
2038000	2040000	Like, I took a bath today.
2040000	2041000	Epsom salts and vodka.
2043000	2046000	And just a little bit of a fraud complex.
2047000	2048000	Just a hint.
2052000	2053000	Everybody kind of characterized.
2053000	2055000	Oh, she died and was kind of characterized
2055000	2057000	as drug overdose and stuff.
2057000	2058000	Her husband died.
2060000	2062000	They had black mold in their shower.
2063000	2064000	Jesus.
2064000	2065000	They died of the same thing.
2065000	2070000	And because they, I mean, fucking horrible and terrifying.
2070000	2072000	And there's nothing good about that.
2072000	2073000	There's no silver.
2073000	2075000	Try to find the silver lining in that one.
2076000	2080000	What's really terrifying is the symptoms of mold poisoning
2080000	2083000	that can lead from like anything from like headaches
2083000	2087000	to stuffy nose to like bleeding eye sockets and then death.
2087000	2089000	And so it's like, oh, I have a headache.
2089000	2090000	Oh, I'm dead.
2090000	2093000	Like, like just normal maladies.
2093000	2097000	And you go out knowing that if you're me, for instance,
2097000	2099000	that everyone's going to go, oh, he was an alcoholic.
2100000	2102000	Like, like, that's what killed him.
2102000	2104000	And I'm going to be like, no, Mike, that's,
2104000	2106000	you guarantee I will haunt your asses.
2107000	2109000	And I'll be like pointing at the black mold
2109000	2111000	and everyone will be like, oh, it's Dan Harmon.
2111000	2113000	He's, he's, he's, he's.
2113000	2115000	What's the gold buried over there?
2117000	2119000	No, it's black mold.
2120000	2121000	It's not gold.
2123000	2125000	You can only hear tea.
2125000	2127000	Yeah, there's oil in the back.
2127000	2129000	That's why ghosts are so misunderstood.
2129000	2131000	You can only hear their vowels.
2132000	2133000	They're not saying boo.
2133000	2134000	They're saying...
2134000	2135000	They're saying true.
2136000	2137000	They're saying true.
2142000	2143000	They're saying chew.
2143000	2145000	They don't want you to choke like they did.
2146000	2150000	20 times, it seems excessive, but...
2156000	2158000	The ghost is just murmuring at me.
2160000	2161000	All right, black mold.
2161000	2163000	Okay, so yeah, so you would go in my garage
2163000	2166000	and be like, oh, God, this is a death trap.
2166000	2169000	So we sealed it off on the outside,
2169000	2171000	like big expensive landscaping job.
2171000	2174000	And then because we did that now today,
2174000	2176000	Aaron hired a task rabbit,
2176000	2177000	I'm familiar with this,
2177000	2179000	to come in and like help clean out the garage.
2179000	2182000	So he goes up, so there's a bunch of stuff in the storage there.
2182000	2184000	Big cardboard boxes full of stuff
2184000	2186000	that we've put into cold storage up there.
2187000	2190000	All water damage because of the water it's seeping through.
2190000	2191000	So I wasn't down there.
2191000	2193000	Aaron came up and reported this to me.
2193000	2196000	But the guy reached up, touched the first box on the top left,
2196000	2198000	and it disintegrated in his hands,
2198000	2201000	and a thousand porn magazines just...
2202000	2206000	flooded, like Stanley Kubrick's blood elevator.
2208000	2212000	Just nothing but like 10 years of pre-internet,
2212000	2215000	obsessive compulsive hoarding of porn.
2216000	2217000	You...
2218000	2220000	I was trying to explain to Aaron, I was like,
2220000	2222000	you don't understand, she's 12 years younger than me.
2222000	2225000	I'm like, before the internet,
2225000	2229000	like you never knew if you were going to see this lady again.
2232000	2234000	And she's like, then why buy more?
2234000	2236000	And I'm like, well, because you're done.
2237000	2239000	And then you need more.
2240000	2241000	Why put it in a box?
2241000	2244000	Because I put it in a box before the internets.
2245000	2247000	And the funny thing is that I realized,
2247000	2250000	yeah, because then remember, guys my age,
2251000	2253000	when you first started,
2253000	2257000	we all had like a folder somewhere hidden away.
2257000	2259000	It was like the same instinct.
2259000	2261000	It was like, you got to hoard this porn,
2261000	2262000	but it's everywhere.
2262000	2265000	And it's like, do you realize the reason that folder is so full
2265000	2268000	is because the porn will never end and you don't need it?
2268000	2270000	And like, and now finally I've caught up
2270000	2271000	with the rest of the world.
2271000	2273000	We're all like, we're just awash in porn.
2273000	2275000	Like, why would you ever save anything?
2275000	2276000	Why do you still have those boxes?
2276000	2278000	Why not like throw those out?
2278000	2281000	Because not only were those boxes filled long ago,
2281000	2283000	they were also like packed away long ago.
2283000	2285000	So they were just boxes that were...
2285000	2288000	Those boxes were still sealed, you know,
2288000	2290000	before I moved into that house.
2290000	2292000	And then you just take the boxes with you.
2292000	2295000	You had a folder, like a little, like, manila folder.
2295000	2298000	There was pieces of porn that you had torn out.
2298000	2299000	Yeah, because I would try to consolidate.
2299000	2303000	I'd be like, okay, it's like archiving your hard drive
2303000	2305000	or like compressing it like a zip file.
2305000	2306000	Like, okay, well, what's really...
2306000	2308000	Well, let's get all the redheads out of here and...
2308000	2313000	Like, it's becoming a space problem.
2313000	2315000	It's becoming an actual physical space problem.
2315000	2318000	You had a closet that was like Florida ceiling,
2318000	2320000	just playboys and stuff.
2320000	2323000	But you had this one, like, pretty full manila folder.
2323000	2325000	So I was leafing through it.
2325000	2327000	I'm like, wow, you really like redheads.
2327000	2329000	And you're like, what?
2329000	2331000	You went, oh, fuck, I do.
2331000	2333000	Yeah, I had none.
2333000	2336000	I just went with my guy and, oh, they're all redheads.
2336000	2338000	It's probably, it's, you know, it's face blindness.
2338000	2341000	You go like, oh, their hair is, I noticed that.
2341000	2343000	I go by hair and eyebrows.
2343000	2344000	I didn't know that it was Dave Klein.
2344000	2345000	We were arguing.
2345000	2346000	So he was on the cameras.
2346000	2347000	Is that Dave Klein?
2347000	2351000	You know, or any guy with blonde hair and a beard.
2351000	2352000	Because it could be anybody.
2352000	2354000	And if it was, if Dave Klein had dark hair,
2354000	2357000	I'd be like, is that Spencer?
2357000	2361000	If he had red hair, he'd be in your folder.
2361000	2367000	Yes.
2367000	2370000	And pleated skirt.
2370000	2373000	Like, let's give him a little something.
2373000	2377000	I was watching True Detective,
2377000	2379000	and Colin Farrell has a mustache to the thing.
2379000	2381000	And then there's that one flashback where he meets Vince Vaughn
2381000	2382000	and he doesn't have a mustache.
2382000	2385000	I'm like, who the fuck is this guy now?
2385000	2388000	Oh, it's Colin Farrell just without one thing above his lip.
2388000	2390000	And I just like, static.
2390000	2394000	Because he doesn't have, I need, all my friends look weird.
2394000	2396000	Like, Jeff wears those suits for a reason.
2396000	2397000	Like, I go by props.
2397000	2400000	I need you to have like a hat or like a monocle.
2400000	2402000	Crazy thick eyebrows.
2403000	2405000	Are you saying that I wear suits so that you recognize me?
2405000	2406000	Yeah, yeah.
2406000	2410000	I think you unconsciously know that you will,
2410000	2412000	that you're at risk of like blending into the-
2412000	2414000	I always thought you were a narcissist,
2414000	2416000	but that's too far.
2416000	2418000	That's too fucking far.
2418000	2422000	I'll prove I'm not a narcissist by taking a back seat
2422000	2425000	to our guest, Curtis Armstrong.
2426000	2427000	I suck.
2437000	2440000	Also Dan, before we say hi to Curtis,
2440000	2444000	I want to say thank you for that great feminist tale you told us.
2446000	2448000	Yeah, speaking of feminism,
2448000	2451000	I have a lot of porn in my garage.
2451000	2453000	You're really on top of my-
2453000	2456000	Are you like my jokes agent?
2456000	2459000	Like, hey, look at this joke.
2459000	2460000	I said women's soccer.
2460000	2461000	You said speaking of feminism,
2461000	2464000	you told a story about having a lot of porn magazines.
2464000	2466000	Yeah, yeah, funny.
2468000	2470000	Because it's not feminism.
2470000	2472000	Oh, oh, okay, okay.
2474000	2475000	Yeah.
2475000	2479000	Jeff loses his sense of irony when he drinks a little bit.
2479000	2482000	Remember when he was so angry about chainsingers?
2484000	2486000	You're not-
2486000	2488000	Still am, still am, Dan.
2488000	2491000	I'm too drunk to even talk about it right now.
2492000	2493000	Sorry, Curtis.
2493000	2494000	That's all right.
2494000	2495000	That's a rude way to bring out a guest.
2495000	2496000	No, it's a fine way.
2496000	2497000	I'm used to it.
2500000	2503000	I was also thinking because of porn in your garage
2503000	2507000	because I kept porn in my garage.
2507000	2509000	Did you ever have that conversation with your wife?
2509000	2510000	I did, actually.
2510000	2512000	But the thing that people don't realize,
2512000	2515000	especially if you're with someone who's a lot younger than you,
2515000	2520000	is that it used to be difficult to get porn.
2520000	2524000	I mean, you had to go into a store and face a person.
2524000	2527000	And sometimes it was a young woman like your own age
2527000	2529000	who was working in the store,
2529000	2533000	and you had to buy your porn and actually look at someone
2533000	2535000	as opposed to doing it in the privacy of your room.
2535000	2536000	I never saw it.
2536000	2537000	I couldn't even consider that.
2537000	2538000	I did.
2538000	2539000	My guy was always like a-
2539000	2540000	Like a really horrible-
2540000	2544000	Like a Vietnam vet with a cigar in his ear.
2544000	2547000	I always thought they kind of profiled for those jobs
2547000	2549000	as a way of guaranteeing sales.
2549000	2552000	I always dreamed of that, but it never worked out that way.
2552000	2557000	It was like there was always the guy with the bad, horrible face
2557000	2560000	and the drool who was there most of the time.
2560000	2562000	And then when I would go in to get my penthouse,
2562000	2566000	it would be somebody like a 19-year-old woman.
2567000	2570000	That's just bad business at an adult bookstore.
2570000	2572000	Oh, I never went to adult bookstores.
2572000	2575000	I would only go to regular bookstores
2575000	2578000	that had the section in the back where everything was covered up.
2578000	2581000	I think you grew up in a bigger city than me.
2581000	2582000	That's possible.
2582000	2584000	That's something that could sustain that in their economy.
2584000	2586000	But I kept them for years.
2586000	2589000	I found them constantly-
2592000	2595000	After a while, I didn't want to go out and buy them anymore,
2595000	2599000	so I just used the same ones over and over again.
2599000	2602000	Someone should study this, and no one ever will now
2602000	2605000	because we're now in this digital age.
2605000	2608000	This is anthropology we're talking about now.
2608000	2611000	But there's some kind of useful data there about the human mind,
2611000	2612000	the male mind, the sex driver,
2612000	2614000	something in the visual relationship with it
2614000	2619000	because to study how big does the pile have to be,
2619000	2622000	assuming one wank a day-
2622000	2623000	One.
2623000	2624000	As if.
2624000	2627000	I'm just making simple numbers.
2627000	2628000	Okay.
2628000	2631000	As I was jerking off on St. Ives,
2631000	2633000	I met a man with seven brides.
2633000	2637000	I don't want to get into that situation.
2637000	2640000	How tall does the pile have to be,
2640000	2643000	the theoretical pile, before the stuff on the bottom
2643000	2646000	becomes new again for a guy?
2646000	2648000	Oh, that's a good question.
2648000	2650000	Because that phenomenon would happen.
2650000	2651000	There were times when I would think,
2652000	2653000	why are you doing this?
2653000	2654000	You're a hoarder is why.
2654000	2659000	You're a weird hoarder and an addict
2659000	2662000	and you're keeping this stuff out of some strange,
2662000	2664000	but then sure enough, at some point,
2664000	2667000	the hoarder's worst nightmare is like,
2667000	2670000	oh my God, what if I need that ball of string or something?
2670000	2673000	Oh my God, what was that one?
2673000	2675000	What did that lady look like when she was playing the pinball machine?
2675000	2676000	Right, yeah.
2676000	2678000	She had the cobra boots and-
2678000	2679000	Yeah.
2679000	2681000	And then if you can't find it, it's like a panic.
2681000	2683000	You're like, where is Margaret?
2683000	2685000	Yeah, yeah.
2685000	2688000	And what I found was that they were usually,
2688000	2691000	the ones that I had were generic enough
2691000	2694000	that I would have to make up whole stories.
2694000	2698000	So after, I didn't need that big of a pile
2698000	2705000	because it was actually a great exercise in storytelling, basically.
2705000	2709000	That after a while, I'd go back to the other ones
2709000	2711000	and then it would be a whole new story.
2711000	2713000	She'd be French now.
2713000	2714000	Yeah.
2714000	2716000	I'd met her on a train.
2716000	2718000	And now it's just a big free-for-all.
2718000	2720000	I know, and now it's so easy.
2720000	2722000	You kids today, you don't know how good you got it.
2722000	2725000	I used to jerk off uphill both ways to school.
2725000	2728000	That's right.
2728000	2730000	You had to work for it back then.
2730000	2732000	You had to hunt and gather.
2732000	2734000	That's right.
2734000	2737000	I wonder about the female side of it
2737000	2740000	because there's the myth that women aren't visually stimulated.
2740000	2742000	There's the myth that women...
2742000	2744000	I'd be willing to bet,
2744000	2746000	but I'm also very willing to be wrong about this.
2746000	2749000	I'd be willing to bet there's probably a huge difference
2749000	2753000	in the amount of porn that women consume, et cetera.
2753000	2757000	But I've had enough conversations with enough confessional women
2757000	2761000	to know that there's a myth that they don't fart
2761000	2763000	and they never watch porn.
2763000	2767000	They do both, usually at the same time.
2767000	2770000	That's a stereotype that does hold up.
2770000	2772000	It turns them on for some reason.
2772000	2774000	That's why they don't like when men fart
2774000	2778000	because they think farts are really sexy,
2778000	2780000	but only when they do it themselves
2780000	2782000	and they don't want anyone around
2782000	2787000	because their farts sound like a beautiful glass flute.
2787000	2790000	And it's Tolkien-esque.
2790000	2793000	It's like if a man hears a woman fart,
2793000	2798000	he'll be drawn to the ocean and he'll drown himself.
2798000	2800000	And they don't want to do that to us
2800000	2803000	because they're one with the tide.
2803000	2806000	Right, right.
2806000	2809000	And the road goes ever on.
2809000	2812000	Led Zeppelin.
2812000	2815000	But I am curious about the female perspective
2815000	2817000	on not only porn in general,
2817000	2820000	but more importantly, the fact that now it has changed
2820000	2826000	from a world where you used to really have to be dedicated
2826000	2831000	to, you know, you had to take physical action
2831000	2835000	to seek out pornography at some point.
2835000	2837000	It's changing into a world where, no,
2837000	2839000	everyone's private life and private thoughts
2839000	2841000	are sort of like their own business
2841000	2843000	and they're all digital now.
2843000	2845000	And we'll never be able to measure this
2845000	2847000	and how do you ask people and how do you measure it.
2847000	2850000	But, you know, have women increased
2850000	2854000	their pornographic consumption?
2854000	2859000	Has their outlook changed as a result?
2859000	2862000	You know, there's a million fascinating questions
2862000	2868000	that only Thor can answer in heaven.
2868000	2871000	I'll explain my religion in a minute.
2871000	2877000	Sort of a fusion of pop culture and evangelical Christianity.
2877000	2879000	I want to be a Christian, but I don't want to read anything
2879000	2881000	except comic books.
2881000	2891000	So when you die, Iron Man weighs your soul against Thor's hammer.
2891000	2896000	Not surprised Dave Cline is a Thor fan.
2896000	2899000	So did I take that to mean that you,
2899000	2901000	did you marry a younger lady?
2901000	2903000	I married a younger, yes.
2903000	2905000	We've talked about that.
2905000	2908000	The first wife was older actually, second wife was younger.
2908000	2915000	Ah, you old dog.
2915000	2919000	Did you, I was talking about, I don't know when you got here,
2919000	2922000	I threw out my back yesterday and I...
2922000	2923000	Oh, I'm sorry.
2923000	2927000	Sorry, baby.
2927000	2930000	I was listening to a 90s alternative station
2930000	2934000	while I was soaking my bad back and they had a hip pain commercial
2934000	2936000	on the 90s alternative hits.
2936000	2938000	Anyways, I just started to feel old today,
2938000	2941000	not necessarily in a bad way, but I was just curious,
2941000	2945000	thresholds that you've crossed where,
2945000	2950000	if you recall any, I don't know, major events.
2950000	2953000	I remember punching the dashboard of my car on New Year's Eve
2953000	2955000	because I had just turned 26.
2955000	2958000	And I was like, I'm wasting my fucking life.
2958000	2962000	And I physically punched the dashboard of my car until it broke.
2962000	2965000	Like, because I was like, 26 fucking years old.
2965000	2967000	What have you done?
2967000	2971000	And I was screaming it to myself alone on New Year's Eve.
2971000	2973000	You were alone on New Year's Eve?
2973000	2975000	That's probably what I was mad about.
2975000	2983000	And I wanted to make it about progress, you know, my industriousness.
2984000	2989000	Wow, that's really sad.
2989000	2994000	I mean, I did, you know, I usually went to the movies on New Year's Eve.
2994000	3004000	I didn't have any, I don't remember any moments of sort of huge threshold experiences
3004000	3010000	where I was smashing stuff or anything like that because of a threshold.
3010000	3014000	I mean, I used to do stuff like that, but not for any reason.
3014000	3016000	Oh, what did you smash stuff for?
3016000	3019000	Oh, just, you know, to get stuff out.
3019000	3025000	And, you know, I used to, when I lived in New York, I used to throw knives into the wall.
3025000	3031000	I had a wall that was where I would just, you know, late at night throw knives into it.
3031000	3032000	Kitchen knives?
3032000	3033000	Just steak knives?
3033000	3037000	Yeah, yeah.
3037000	3040000	But I just did that to kill time, really.
3040000	3041000	Yeah.
3041000	3045000	I used to throw knives when I was younger, and Aaron got me some throwing knives,
3045000	3049000	but I don't have the time to set up a target or anything.
3049000	3051000	That's why I used the wall.
3051000	3053000	I didn't have to set anything up.
3053000	3055000	Throwing knives is very, very, it's very relaxing.
3055000	3059000	Well, it's something when you're in your 20s, you feel like you're doing something cool,
3059000	3062000	and it's phallic, and you're throwing knives.
3062000	3064000	I was going to say, it's like very, it can't be anything.
3064000	3067000	It's something, you know, that cool people did.
3067000	3068000	Right.
3068000	3070000	In like a tavern over a flag and a veil.
3070000	3071000	Exactly.
3071000	3075000	But really, all you're doing is taking a little metaphor for your ineffective penis
3075000	3077000	and fucking a wall with it.
3077000	3078000	Exactly.
3078000	3081000	Because you're just like any other piece of fucking garbage.
3081000	3082000	Oh, God.
3082000	3084000	Yes, I know.
3084000	3086000	Did you destroy that wall?
3086000	3087000	Pretty much, yeah.
3087000	3091000	But, I mean, it was an apartment that you wouldn't notice in particular,
3091000	3093000	so it wasn't a big deal.
3093000	3097000	But, yeah, you know.
3097000	3098000	You do those things.
3098000	3103000	But I was not, I didn't smash anything because I was getting old.
3103000	3104000	Oh, wow.
3104000	3105000	I really got through my whole list.
3105000	3108000	This is going to be a terrible show.
3108000	3111000	There's French rappers standing at the Airbnb next to us.
3111000	3112000	I mean, I could start ripping out theirs.
3112000	3114000	You mean when you're down in San Diego?
3114000	3115000	No.
3115000	3116000	Oh, thank you.
3116000	3117000	God damn it.
3117000	3119000	Jesus, we have lots to talk about.
3119000	3120000	San Diego.
3120000	3121000	We're going to be at San Diego next week.
3121000	3122000	Yes, you are.
3122000	3123000	I really am.
3123000	3125000	Are you coming, Curtis?
3125000	3128000	I'm going there, but not when you're there.
3128000	3130000	I'm going earlier.
3130000	3131000	When?
3131000	3132000	I'm going Thursday.
3132000	3134000	We're going to be down there Thursday, but not when we're doing it.
3134000	3135000	You mean not when we're doing the show?
3135000	3136000	Not when you're doing the show.
3136000	3138000	Yeah, Padgett Brewster is going to be down there, but she's down there.
3138000	3141000	She said, you're not there until Thursday, right?
3141000	3143000	And they said, yeah, how early are you supposed to go?
3143000	3145000	She said, she's going down Wednesday.
3145000	3149000	What are you going to help TV Guide set up their yachts?
3149000	3150000	Exactly.
3151000	3152000	I don't understand.
3152000	3154000	It's such a social thing.
3154000	3156000	It's an amazingly social thing.
3156000	3161000	I was actually going down there because I got invited, because I've never been to Comic-Con
3161000	3164000	as a fan, and yet I'm a huge fan.
3164000	3170000	And I want to go to Comic-Cons as a fan, but then I always wind up getting tagged,
3170000	3174000	and I never wind up actually doing what I want to do.
3174000	3177000	Usually, I go there because I'm selling something like everybody else.
3177000	3178000	When you say tagged, you mean like...
3179000	3186000	I mean, because I'm wandering around, and they think I'm there for Comic-Con,
3186000	3189000	like I'm selling something.
3189000	3193000	But actually, I'm just there to look at things that I like.
3193000	3201000	And so this time, I've been invited to go because I'm a big fan of Orphan Black.
3201000	3204000	And they're down there, and they invited me to come down.
3204000	3207000	So I'm going to go as a fan to Orphan Black.
3207000	3212000	But then I'm also going to see, Thursday night, the Baker Street Babes,
3212000	3217000	which is an all-women's Sherlock Holmes group that I'm connected with.
3220000	3222000	What's this Sherlock Holmes group?
3222000	3225000	Well, it's a group of people who study the sacred writings.
3225000	3228000	Oh, they study? Okay. Cool.
3228000	3231000	It's all women. It's a new group.
3231000	3238000	It formed in New York as sort of a cheeky response to the old guard Sherlockians in New York.
3238000	3242000	And they're going to be there, so I'm going to go down and play with them.
3242000	3246000	But that's what happens, is you go down, and that's what Padgett's doing.
3246000	3250000	She's going down to just play with people.
3253000	3257000	Is it a performance, the Sherlock people?
3257000	3260000	They've got a booth and stuff.
3260000	3262000	When you say play, you mean literally just play.
3262000	3265000	I mean just hang out, because I know them from New York.
3265000	3271000	So, yeah, and if you ever want to get away from the, you know, and just float freely through the crowd,
3271000	3275000	you know, you get to graduate to the, you get to dress like a stormtrooper or something.
3275000	3279000	I know, I know. I was going to do that, and this all happened at the last minute,
3279000	3283000	so I don't have time to put the costume together, or I would have done that.
3283000	3286000	What would you go as if you could go as any costume character?
3286000	3293000	I was going to go as one of the characters that Tatiana Maslany plays in Orphan Black.
3293000	3297000	I was going to actually do, I wasn't going to just cosplay for the first time.
3297000	3301000	I was going to drag cosplay.
3301000	3307000	And I was going to play Helena, who's the psychotic killer.
3307000	3312000	But then I realized I had to do it properly, and I didn't have time to do it properly,
3312000	3316000	because now I just say the hell with it. I'm going to wander around, and whatever happens, it happens.
3316000	3325000	Erin is supposedly cooking up a little combo costume for us that I encouraged her to do.
3325000	3326000	Really?
3326000	3329000	Yeah, I hope she can pull off, and she usually tends to.
3329000	3333000	What is your show going to be down there? Where do you do that? How do you do that?
3333000	3338000	Funny you should ask. We're going to be at the, so, at the tin roof?
3338000	3339000	Tin roof, yeah.
3339000	3341000	In the gas lamp district? Gas light? Gas lamp?
3341000	3342000	Gas light.
3342000	3347000	If you get to the gas light, you've gone too far. You want to go, but it's still a lamp.
3347000	3351000	But not all the way to the light bulb. That's way too far.
3351000	3355000	If you get to gas town, you're in Vancouver.
3355000	3364000	Yeah, it's at the tin roof and the gas lamp light, and it's on Sunday night, so stay the extra night if you can.
3364000	3370000	There's still seats available as far as I know, but it's a good size crowd. It'll be a good show anyway.
3370000	3375000	But here's incentive if you need it. Aaron's been making merchandise and stuff.
3375000	3382000	There's going to be limited edition MC John t-shirts.
3382000	3389000	I guess in order to make them truly limited edition, we'll only sell them that night.
3389000	3396000	And really the only reason we'll sell them instead of giving away is because we couldn't make enough to give away and then bring them on the bus.
3397000	3400000	We'll just have them there available.
3400000	3407000	And I think there's another t-shirt she's working on, and I know there's a print of a Shadowrun poster.
3407000	3412000	Yeah, it's made by the same guy who did the D&D line art drawing from the first tour.
3412000	3417000	It's Anthony Suarez did this Shadowrun group of the gang.
3417000	3422000	And I think there's going to be a free Rick and Morty poster that you can get to.
3423000	3426000	And the drawing is Dr. Friend Kumail, or should it more rightly be Curtis?
3426000	3428000	It's Kumail.
3428000	3430000	It's Kumail!
3430000	3432000	It's all right, I understand.
3432000	3437000	I think it's really funny to imagine this Kumail troll, but then it's your voice coming out of it.
3437000	3442000	Like, I'm a doctor. I really like that mental image personally.
3442000	3444000	Yeah, it's good.
3444000	3448000	So yeah, come, come, come there. Come, come, come all.
3448000	3451000	Come, come everywhere and bring your scarf and shawl.
3451000	3454000	I'm the little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.
3458000	3461000	Come, come over there. Come, come to the south.
3461000	3464000	Come, come on your feet. Come, come in my mouth.
3464000	3467000	I'm a little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.
3467000	3470000	I'm a little elven man that lives in a tree.
3470000	3473000	All I do is promote shows all that I see.
3473000	3476000	Please go to see Rob Schneider at the Truck Show.
3476000	3479000	He was in Dukes of Hazzard and now he's nowhere to go.
3479000	3482000	Because his car had a racist flag on it.
3482000	3485000	I'm a little show promoter and I wear a bonnet.
3485000	3488000	It was my mom's idea. She made me a baby.
3488000	3491000	I want to fuck her or kill her, or maybe.
3498000	3499000	Wait.
3499000	3500000	I disagree.
3500000	3504000	Three feet tall show promoter, why do you want to fuck her kill your mother?
3507000	3513000	You try being born three feet tall and not having fucking psychosexual issues.
3515000	3517000	With your mother that made you wear a bonnet.
3517000	3519000	Were you listening to the lyrics?
3519000	3521000	I live in a fucking tree.
3521000	3523000	Fuck anyone up.
3523000	3528000	If you have that much pent-up rage, what made you become a show promoter?
3528000	3532000	I need that hug you can only get from a stranger. What the fuck?
3536000	3540000	Why not be a performer yourself? Why not go into actually being in the show?
3540000	3544000	Why only promote other people's creativity?
3544000	3547000	Look at this scar on my face.
3547000	3549000	Oh shit, I didn't see it.
3549000	3552000	Yeah, well thanks. Thanks for saying that.
3552000	3554000	You were facing the other way.
3556000	3562000	I like to be close to talent and I like to help it.
3562000	3565000	I don't feel comfortable on stage. It's not a choice that I make.
3565000	3568000	Did you ever try when you were younger to be on stage?
3568000	3576000	I dabbled. I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. I'll be on stage. I'll do it if you want it.
3576000	3579000	But I don't have to. I don't have to. I'm one of those people. I don't have to.
3579000	3584000	I don't have to. I don't have to. I think those people are crazy. I don't have to.
3584000	3588000	I like to promote it. I like what I do. I think what I do is creative.
3588000	3597000	Why are you only three feet tall? Is that a congenital thing?
3597000	3600000	I made a choice.
3600000	3607000	At a very ill-advised fair that I would tell people don't go.
3607000	3610000	There's a lot of questionable vendors there.
3610000	3619000	I did get my name in a grain of rice, but I had most of my lower torso removed.
3619000	3624000	I thought he meant for a picture.
3624000	3630000	You're not a little person. You're a regular sized person with no legs.
3630000	3635000	I paid for this. It's the fucked up thing.
3636000	3642000	You can imagine I'm a man with no country. I go to little people conventions.
3642000	3649000	No, I don't anymore. They're fucking assholes to me.
3649000	3655000	I think you know how your people treat me.
3655000	3661000	I do what I do. I hang out. I'm not bitter.
3661000	3670000	I promote shows. Whenever I start singing, people start clapping automatically, which makes me feel...
3670000	3673000	Can I ask you a question? This is off the record.
3673000	3679000	Are you excited about the Harmontown being in the Gaslight or Lamp District?
3679000	3684000	Or is that you just clocking in, doing your job, singing the song?
3684000	3687000	A good promoter remains objective.
3688000	3692000	I always tell people, your craft is what you do. My craft is promotion.
3692000	3694000	For instance, I just finished...
3694000	3699000	Frankly, and this isn't going to win me any popularity contests, but what the fuck is?
3702000	3706000	I just finished doing some radio spots for a Ku Klux Klan rally.
3706000	3710000	We actually have audio of that.
3717000	3720000	Destin, let's roll that clip.
3748000	3751000	And there's Horseshoes.
3753000	3756000	It's 9-11. It's 9-11.
3762000	3766000	I forgot to ask you, last question, last question.
3766000	3771000	Three feet tall, show promoter. What's your name?
3771000	3774000	So we can have a t-shirt.
3777000	3779000	Ty.
3781000	3783000	T-Y?
3783000	3785000	T-A-Y-E.
3789000	3793000	Were you born T-A-Y-E, or was that you reinventing yourself?
3793000	3798000	My given name is Jonathan Ty Brigston.
3798000	3805000	My father, Jonathan, was a narcissistic asshole, so I go by my middle name.
3805000	3810000	He is no less my name. It was the only way to tell me from him when you called my house.
3810000	3815000	Is Jon there? Oh, which one? Who subjects someone to that?
3816000	3818000	I go by my middle name.
3818000	3822000	What was the booth where they cut your legs off at the fair?
3823000	3827000	Tiny, tiny, tiny you.
3827000	3831000	Exclamation point.
3835000	3844000	And it had pictures of people, and they were their given height, and then next to them, it was like before or after, and they were smaller.
3844000	3848000	I thought it was gag photography.
3848000	3852000	You didn't wish you were actually smaller. You thought it would be a photo.
3853000	3857000	I thought I would walk out of there with a photo.
3858000	3860000	So they removed your legs?
3861000	3868000	They took some of my lower torso, enough. You have a small intestine and a large intestine.
3868000	3875000	They took most of my large intestine, took some of my small intestine and moved it down there to take its place.
3875000	3882000	And they took a tiny bit of my small intestine because it's smaller and you can't live with most of it. Gone.
3883000	3902000	They cut my thigh, and they cut my legs off at the hip, cut my thighs in half and my calves in half, and then took half of each and hinged them with these...
3906000	3912000	...with my own kneecaps, and then did a similar thing with my...
3912000	3915000	Well, they didn't do anything with my arms, they just wanted me to be...
3916000	3919000	Is tiny me still in existence?
3919000	3920000	Tiny you.
3920000	3921000	Tiny you, sorry.
3922000	3928000	And here's the thing that I'm not telling you, because it embarrasses me and makes me the villain of this story instead of the victim.
3928000	3932000	But I've told my story and no one cares, which is why I work in promotion now.
3933000	3938000	The truth of it is, on my way into the fair, Burning Man.
3945000	3948000	I ran over a dwarf family.
3952000	3953000	On the way in.
3953000	3957000	On the way in. Parking was hard, I don't know if you've been to Burning Man.
3958000	3963000	It's all about being a hippie and all this stuff, but it's fucking hard to park.
3963000	3967000	And it gets frustrating, and I was a different person back then.
3968000	3971000	I ran over a dwarf family, got out of the car.
3971000	3973000	Did you kill them? Did they survive?
3973000	3975000	I got out of the car.
3976000	3977000	Sorry.
3978000	3983000	I ran to the only remaining living dwarf.
3988000	3990000	Was this a child or one of the adults?
3990000	3995000	It was an elderly woman dressed in, I guess, what I would describe as shamanic attire.
3996000	4001000	As I reached for her to ask if she was okay, if she had insurance.
4005000	4012000	Her hand gripped my face and her toothless mouth hissed shorter.
4017000	4022000	And I laughed it off.
4022000	4025000	You must have thought she's just a big Stephen King fan.
4026000	4029000	Yeah, I said that's ridiculous.
4029000	4031000	Let's get you to a hospital.
4032000	4035000	And then stupid me, and this is the part that's really embarrassing,
4035000	4040000	when I saw that booth, I said to my wife, wouldn't this be hilarious given the events earlier?
4043000	4045000	So yeah, I deserve it.
4046000	4050000	That's the conclusion, everyone, that here's the story it comes to.
4050000	4052000	I stopped telling it.
4053000	4057000	So I'm in promotion. I like to focus on other people.
4058000	4059000	It's a little embarrassing.
4059000	4063000	When you go into Tiny U and you're in the booth, and it's not a photograph thing,
4063000	4065000	there's actually a surgical procedure that happens.
4065000	4067000	Do they knock you out?
4069000	4071000	Are you alert during this procedure?
4072000	4075000	Okay, you're going to drag every embarrassing detail out of this.
4077000	4080000	I'm only asking because this is riveting shit.
4081000	4085000	I was on peyote already. I was at Burning Man.
4085000	4088000	I took peyote. That's why I hit the Dwarven family.
4088000	4090000	I was at every drug known to man.
4090000	4093000	There was no police camp? There was no like, like, inquest?
4093000	4095000	There's no cops at Burning Man, bro.
4097000	4100000	You want cops? Go to the G8 Summit, motherfucker.
4102000	4107000	So, okay. So you're on peyote. You're going to Tiny U.
4107000	4111000	Peyote, mescaline. I put a tiny...
4111000	4113000	Peyote and mescaline sometimes.
4114000	4116000	Just cover your bases.
4116000	4118000	They call it a curveball.
4120000	4122000	You do those at the same time.
4122000	4128000	I had, you know, three ritalin and I think, like, just a little bit of...
4128000	4133000	a couple tutors of coke and some poppers of Amol
4133000	4138000	and a little bit of VHS head cleaner to dilate my sphincter.
4139000	4141000	Just in case.
4141000	4144000	Back then I cared how big it was.
4144000	4147000	What do they call Amol nitrate poppers and VHS head cleaner?
4147000	4152000	Well, Amol nitrate poppers, it puts you in the mood.
4152000	4155000	I'm not saying is there a nickname like curveball for doing...
4155000	4157000	Oh, doing those both? That's just called a garage.
4159000	4164000	It opens you up with the urge to host a car.
4171000	4175000	You're driving down to Burning Man. You're on a curveball and a garage.
4177000	4179000	A couple tutors of coke.
4179000	4181000	Oh, yeah. Just take the edge off.
4181000	4183000	Fuck that.
4184000	4187000	You murder a family of little people.
4188000	4189000	It was called...
4189000	4191000	The cops don't come because they're not there.
4192000	4194000	They're at the G8.
4195000	4198000	You and your wife go, wow.
4198000	4200000	Fucking so high right now.
4201000	4203000	There's a booth there called Tiny You.
4203000	4205000	You go in there, who do you meet?
4205000	4207000	What's the person that works...
4207000	4213000	I want to know everything.
4213000	4217000	First of all, why isn't there a date line on Tiny You?
4219000	4224000	Why hasn't this terrible company not been outed for...
4224000	4229000	They conduct their business in the back alleys and Burning Man's of the world.
4229000	4232000	They get away with it. This is something I've been screaming about,
4232000	4234000	but no one wants to hear my story.
4234000	4237000	As you've noticed, when I get enthusiastic about anything,
4237000	4240000	everyone starts clapping because I'm fucking...
4240000	4243000	It's hard being me and being dehumanized.
4243000	4245000	No one takes me seriously.
4245000	4247000	It's like I'm a leprechaun all the time.
4247000	4250000	Everyone just keeps clapping every time I have an opinion.
4250000	4253000	I somehow enable it by talking in rhymes sometimes,
4253000	4256000	but I don't try to all the time.
4256000	4259000	This is exactly what happened in the courtroom.
4261000	4263000	And they left.
4264000	4272000	I left. I stormed out.
4272000	4279000	One of the problems is, because my legs are made of half femur, half calf,
4279000	4283000	when I storm out, it looks like dancing.
4284000	4287000	And of course, they didn't do it precisely,
4287000	4291000	so one leg is shorter than the other, so I dance in a circle.
4291000	4294000	So I start saying things I'm passionate about.
4294000	4297000	Everyone starts clapping. I get mad. I want to leave.
4297000	4300000	I'm dancing in a circle.
4300000	4302000	And this is my life, so I'm in promotion.
4302000	4304000	I'm in promotion now.
4304000	4307000	And I'm not bitter, and I like it.
4308000	4320000	My name is Ty Brigston, and I'm a new classic Harmentown character
4320000	4325000	that is really offensive.
4332000	4334000	Thanks for coming, Ty.
4335000	4339000	And a morning zoo team.
4342000	4344000	Let's get Demorge out here.
4344000	4346000	Demorge!
4357000	4359000	Demorge Brown.
4361000	4362000	Yes, sir.
4363000	4366000	Hey, Demorge, not because you're black, but because you're my black friend.
4368000	4369000	That I am.
4369000	4373000	And I know you're not an ambassador of your race.
4373000	4375000	Far from it.
4376000	4378000	The things this guy does.
4379000	4383000	But I just personally, you personally, how do you feel about
4383000	4388000	when you see a fast food commercial that's targeting...
4388000	4390000	You realize that I've been in those, too.
4391000	4393000	You know all those Burger Kings with Joel McHale.
4393000	4395000	I'm the black guy in those ads.
4395000	4397000	But being the black guy in...
4397000	4400000	But I'm talking about the ads where literally everyone in the ad is black
4400000	4402000	and the soundtrack is kind of like...
4402000	4405000	It's been a running thing with me.
4405000	4407000	Because there are certain ads that have black people in them,
4407000	4409000	and they're just ads with black people.
4409000	4411000	And then there are ads that are black.
4412000	4415000	And the best example I can give of this is I had an audition once,
4415000	4417000	and I had an agent who was like,
4417000	4420000	I know you've had four today, I'm going to send you on a fifth.
4423000	4424000	You gotta go.
4424000	4426000	Because I can't believe this is real.
4427000	4429000	And I had a clause in my thing.
4429000	4431000	Like when I first signed with him, they said,
4431000	4433000	is there anything you won't do?
4433000	4436000	And I said, I won't do cigarette stuff and no KFC.
4438000	4439000	And this is when...
4439000	4443000	And she said, it's a KFC thing, just go, please do it for me.
4443000	4445000	You'll never, I know, just go.
4445000	4446000	And you'll see what I mean.
4446000	4448000	And so I get there, and there's two ads.
4448000	4450000	There's a black ad, and there's a white ad.
4450000	4456000	And the white ad is that there's a guy who's got a yellow Corvette,
4456000	4458000	and there's a girl next to him, and he's eating chicken fingers.
4458000	4460000	And she's like, oh, I just want to try it.
4460000	4461000	I just want to get in it.
4461000	4463000	And he's like, yeah, babe, I know you did.
4463000	4465000	And ultimately, she's talking about the chicken fingers.
4465000	4466000	Oh, my God.
4468000	4469000	That's like a no Harry novel.
4469000	4471000	She thought he was talking about the car.
4472000	4479000	The black ad is incredibly different, and the room is different.
4479000	4484000	Everybody's in the same room, but the white people are sort of just hanging out, chatting.
4484000	4485000	And then there are these black...
4485000	4487000	And I know that these are actors, these are stage actors,
4487000	4490000	people who know the story, dying laughing.
4490000	4492000	They're sitting in their seats, and you see these people going,
4492000	4496000	I'm going to eat that chicken.
4496000	4497000	We're going to eat that chicken.
4497000	4499000	And I get the script, and the script says,
4499000	4506000	it opens with a description, the THA boys are watching the game.
4508000	4512000	Mama's in the kitchen fixing up some kitchen fresh chicken
4512000	4516000	because they were trying to take the word fried out of Kentucky Fried Chicken,
4516000	4518000	and so was KFC.
4518000	4524000	And then apparently what happens is the wife of one of the three guys watching the game comes in,
4524000	4526000	sees the mom in there and gets jealous.
4526000	4528000	She's been shopping, shopping.
4529000	4531000	And then she gets upset.
4531000	4534000	So I'm looking at this, I'm looking at these guys,
4534000	4535000	and then there's three of us who go in the room,
4535000	4538000	and the guy sets with the audition, and the audition is like this.
4538000	4541000	Three guys, we're going to do the ad three times once for each of you guys,
4541000	4543000	and I'm going to give notes.
4543000	4545000	The cast directors are going to give notes.
4545000	4549000	The first guy gives his best shot, and the first line is,
4549000	4552000	the woman comes in, she goes, what are you guys doing?
4552000	4555000	And the guy's first line is, the line is written,
4555000	4558000	the line is written, eating kitchen fresh chicken.
4558000	4562000	And the guy says, eating kitchen fresh chicken is subtly as best as he can.
4562000	4566000	The guy gives notes, and he says, no notes to him.
4566000	4569000	To the wife, you should be really mad.
4569000	4572000	You see, this mom is in here, and she's in your territory.
4572000	4574000	So, you know, I don't know if you've ever seen Rolando,
4574000	4576000	but your neck's got to pop, and you've got to,
4576000	4580000	and mama, if you could just really make that chicken for us so that we get,
4580000	4581000	but anyway, go.
4581000	4583000	And then the second take, they come around to come to me,
4583000	4586000	and I've already decided I'm going to do this snagglepuss voice for the line.
4586000	4593000	So, I say, they come to me, and then she says the line,
4593000	4597000	and she's markedly upset and, you know, glistening a bit at this point,
4597000	4604000	and I say, eating a kitchen fresh chicken.
4604000	4608000	The guy comes over, no notes for me.
4608000	4611000	Honestly, I don't know if you've seen Rolando,
4611000	4616000	but you've got, like the women that get upset, and mama, honestly, with the chicken,
4616000	4619000	you know, maybe if you open up more, we'll see more of you so we can do that.
4619000	4622000	The third guy tops me.
4622000	4624000	He does this.
4624000	4629000	He can do my chicken!
4629000	4635000	And the craziest part about it is, I get a call back.
4635000	4638000	I go to the call back, and that dude is there.
4638000	4640000	Not the other guy.
4640000	4644000	So, I'm like, and look at this, I go, there's got to be somebody in a room that said,
4644000	4646000	I want to see these guys again.
4646000	4649000	We're paired together.
4649000	4653000	So, I get outside, I get out of the room, because I can see them.
4653000	4658000	They're there, and the client is enjoying their time in LA.
4658000	4660000	They're loving their time in LA.
4660000	4663000	So, they're ordering Peking Duck and then Mad, because what do you mean they have to call ahead?
4663000	4666000	It takes eight hours to make Peking Duck some shit like that.
4666000	4672000	And so, they're very much like, they're the people who wrote the ad, or approved it, or did whatever.
4672000	4676000	And I'm looking at this guy, and the guy goes, you're going to do the same thing.
4676000	4680000	And I said, yeah, I probably am.
4680000	4686000	And then the door flies open, and this Allie McGraw woman walks out,
4686000	4693000	live, lovely, riding boots up to here, a white fisherman sweater with a blue marijuana leaf on it,
4693000	4695000	doesn't even look at us.
4695000	4698000	He takes out a cigarette, takes a drag, blows it straight into the air,
4698000	4701000	then looks at us out of the corner where I smiles and goes in a room.
4701000	4703000	And I go, that's a wild card.
4703000	4706000	And I go, and I bet you anything, there's a black guy in there,
4706000	4711000	and he's probably wearing a polo, and his name is George.
4711000	4715000	And he just wants a corner office, and they probably said, oh, shit, run it by George.
4715000	4717000	And George said, oh, yeah, it's great.
4717000	4722000	And we go in the room, and there's a dude in a lavender polo sitting in a corner with a bristly mustache,
4722000	4724000	and his head's down, and he's flipping through notes, and he looks up,
4724000	4726000	and then he looks down right away.
4726000	4728000	And we did the same thing.
4728000	4731000	They called me to give me the job, and I was like, my agent goes, just a minute.
4731000	4733000	So you went, kitchen of fresh chicken.
4733000	4735000	In the room with them.
4735000	4739000	I said, kitchen of fresh chicken.
4739000	4741000	With no intention of doing the job.
4741000	4743000	With no intention of doing the job, obviously.
4743000	4744000	What the fuck is happening?
4744000	4745000	I have no idea.
4745000	4746000	I really don't know.
4746000	4750000	Ultimately, I don't think it matters, and I think even if they recognize that that's what you're doing,
4750000	4754000	they realize that on the day, if you're the actor they think you are,
4754000	4758000	and they think very little often, when they're making those types of ads of actors,
4758000	4759000	they think, well, we get them on the day.
4759000	4760000	The actor will do the thing.
4760000	4761000	The agent will make the thing.
4761000	4764000	You think there's full awareness of what's going on there, that they're a little embarrassed?
4764000	4767000	Somewhere in the production company or somewhere, somebody knows something.
4767000	4769000	I'm 42 years old.
4769000	4773000	I'm lucky enough to have been doing shit for 20 years that involved directing people,
4773000	4775000	tweaking performances and stuff.
4775000	4784000	I have at least four occasions had to ask a black performer to basically black it up.
4784000	4787000	Because it was part of the...
4787000	4789000	No, Murder He Raps.
4789000	4793000	I think you need to do a thing.
4793000	4796000	I was doing straight reads on the lines.
4796000	4799000	There's always this brick wall where it's like, we all know what's going on.
4799000	4801000	There's this uncomfortable moment.
4801000	4804000	It's almost like a reverse handshake.
4804000	4809000	Jordan Peele came in and did this time monster.
4809000	4811000	The dialogue was written.
4811000	4814000	We wrote it for Key and Peele.
4814000	4819000	The idea was these fourth dimensional time monster creatures come in,
4819000	4826000	and their dialect is like, they're very black.
4826000	4828000	Very.
4828000	4830000	And it's not my friend.
4830000	4832000	Kitchen fresh chicken.
4832000	4834000	As in the book.
4834000	4836000	You talk about those ads.
4836000	4839000	For example, Adolph Caesar, one time when I was learning to get...
4839000	4842000	I had a wonderful voiceover teacher for commercials in Boston,
4842000	4845000	and she gave me a Don Buchwald audition tape one time, I think.
4845000	4847000	Adolph Caesar's voice was on there.
4847000	4851000	It's every black ad ever from one of the greatest actors of all time.
4851000	4853000	You'll recognize why it's the guy that said,
4853000	4855000	a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
4855000	4859000	And he had like a BC powder aspirin, like aspirin powder ad,
4859000	4864000	where he's like, you've got a dirty lowdown rotten headache.
4864000	4866000	Every ad was amazing.
4866000	4869000	And he's in an ad, I saw this only one time during the Grammys
4869000	4871000	when I was a kid, and I don't know where this ad is.
4871000	4873000	If they find it, it will go viral.
4873000	4875000	It was a black McDonald's ad,
4875000	4878000	I think targeted at the Grammys with James Brown in it,
4878000	4880000	but only for a moment.
4880000	4882000	And it's black kids in a McDonald's going,
4882000	4884000	oh, they run up to the show, and it's like James Brown concert,
4884000	4885000	sold out.
4885000	4889000	And they're like, oh, man, we didn't make it in time.
4889000	4891000	Hey, fellas, look across the street.
4891000	4892000	There's McDonald's.
4892000	4893000	We're going to Mickey D's.
4893000	4894000	Oh, it's all right.
4894000	4896000	When there's not enough James Brown.
4896000	4897000	What are you going to get?
4897000	4898000	I'm going to get a big man.
4898000	4899000	What are you going to get?
4899000	4901000	I don't know, but I know when I get up there.
4901000	4904000	And then they're waiting in line, and the door flies open.
4904000	4906000	So far, this is a great commercial.
4906000	4909000	This is why I don't know why I only saw this one.
4909000	4911000	The door flies open in the last second.
4911000	4913000	The door flies open.
4913000	4916000	James Brown comes in the entire thing on one leg, and he goes,
4916000	4917000	ha!
4917000	4918000	It's a good time.
4918000	4919000	For the great taste of McDonald's.
4919000	4920000	No.
4920000	4922000	And then the guy's high five, end of end.
4922000	4924000	And then while it's going on, I think
4924000	4926000	it's Adolph Caesar's voice at the end.
4926000	4928000	It's like, you know what's up.
4928000	4933000	Get on down to Mickey D's.
4933000	4935000	OK, so original question.
4935000	4937000	Because you can find that ad.
4937000	4939000	Because you've got to get up to get down.
4939000	4940000	So forget as an actor.
4940000	4944000	OK, so you were in the trenches on the actor side.
4944000	4946000	Can you compartmentalize as a viewer?
4946000	4949000	When those commercials come on, what
4949000	4950000	happens to you in your brain?
4950000	4952000	Well, I was a kid.
4952000	4954000	I recognized it immediately as a black ad.
4954000	4958000	And I put it in my black ad trunk, which is you see them all.
4958000	4960000	But you know, you see them all.
4960000	4962000	What I loved was they were markedly low risk,
4962000	4964000	and they were markedly worse on average.
4964000	4967000	It was always, oh, it's black grandmother's black birthday.
4967000	4969000	She's buying a black Pontiac.
4970000	4972000	Let's hope she gets her black loan.
4972000	4975000	Like, it was always that, mom, try out the bucket seats.
4975000	4977000	You know, it was always that kind of stuff.
4977000	4980000	As opposed to just other ads which were subtle and weirder.
4980000	4983000	But what was great was there were other ads with black people
4983000	4985000	in them that didn't even target race.
4985000	4988000	Like, there was a little Caesar ad or something.
4988000	4991000	No, no, it was the same people who made the little Caesars ads.
4991000	4995000	Made an ad for like a sale at a department store sale
4995000	4996000	or something like that.
4996000	4999000	And they cut to all these different people who are like,
4999000	5002000	I wish I had known about the sale.
5002000	5005000	And they cut to this one black guy who's in the ad.
5005000	5006000	He dominates the ad.
5006000	5008000	He's a hot dog mender.
5008000	5012000	He goes, I'm holding my weenie and poof, my woman was gone.
5014000	5016000	And that's not a black.
5016000	5020000	It's just the ad is just people everywhere go to this sale.
5020000	5022000	And this guy steals it just by being himself.
5022000	5026000	Oh, look at that.
5026000	5028000	These are the old little Caesar ads.
5028000	5030000	So once I had the dog and different ones where they were like
5030000	5033000	really odd and strange and arch.
5033000	5034000	So jury's out.
5034000	5035000	Yeah.
5035000	5037000	No, I mean, they're horrible.
5037000	5039000	I think they're horrible.
5039000	5043000	But I think what's happened is we're all starting to get
5043000	5045000	the clearest picture.
5045000	5047000	It's the same thing about soccer, perceptions of soccer
5047000	5048000	and that kind of stuff.
5048000	5050000	I've never known a world where soccer didn't rule
5050000	5051000	and everybody was into it.
5051000	5052000	And it was a thing.
5052000	5054000	And I grew up along most people who I think for a while
5054000	5055000	like, oh, no, they'll never catch on.
5055000	5057000	It's like everybody I know played it.
5057000	5061000	And in black, there's a world where I know that everybody,
5061000	5063000	my relatives, my friends, their relatives,
5063000	5065000	they buy everything that everybody else buys.
5065000	5068000	Our consumer dollar is worth everything everybody else is.
5068000	5070000	But also people made fun of that movie Rachel's Wedding
5070000	5072000	because they're like no combinations of people
5072000	5075000	of any ethnicity exists like this and do these kinds of things.
5075000	5076000	That's all I ever knew growing up.
5076000	5078000	And I knew grew up around all these people.
5078000	5084000	These perceptions of the world are now commonplace.
5084000	5086000	And so you get ads where it's, you know,
5086000	5088000	black ads that are subtle and delightful.
5088000	5091000	You get ads that are target to everybody
5091000	5095000	but are primarily black just by ethnicity
5095000	5097000	because they're putting a black family on for the first time
5097000	5101000	or a black husband and wife or couples of mixed ethnicity.
5101000	5102000	That's right.
5102000	5103000	It's confusing because when you go like,
5103000	5105000	what is television's role and what is the,
5105000	5109000	that's what always makes my brain turn into a balloon animal
5109000	5112000	because I'm like, you know, Norman Leary started doing sitcoms
5112000	5114000	that were like, hey, what if, you know,
5114000	5118000	what if we treated this segment of the viewing audience
5118000	5122000	as if they also were human beings which entails something
5122000	5125000	that on any other day you could go like, well, that's also,
5125000	5128000	you know, it just twists my fucking brain
5128000	5130000	and I'll go to my grave awkward.
5130000	5133000	This is just awkward, racially obsessed awkward,
5133000	5135000	can't fuck up on my grave.
5135000	5138000	And I just spent his life trying to figure it out.
5138000	5141000	All of it is all about the fact that we're capable of so much more.
5141000	5144000	Our brains are capable of holding all of it in.
5144000	5149000	And we don't have to necessarily continue to generalize,
5149000	5153000	to get wider, to understand everything on infinite detail.
5153000	5155000	We can actually stay on macro
5155000	5159000	and just take everything in at its own detail and say, you know,
5159000	5162000	like you look at when Tiger Woods was first becoming a thing
5162000	5165000	and look, my mom is tired, my dad's black,
5165000	5167000	but there's also a mixed race parentage in me of other things.
5167000	5169000	So you're telling me that you want me to tell you what I am?
5169000	5171000	Why don't you just ask me about the golf game
5171000	5172000	and not worry about that shit?
5172000	5178000	Which is why the transgender movement might be the Christ of this,
5178000	5180000	you know, thing.
5180000	5183000	Because there will never be a, I shouldn't say this,
5183000	5186000	I'm sure this will get twisted into something inflammatory.
5186000	5190000	Like, believe me, I'm just, there will never be a,
5190000	5193000	there will never be a, such a, it's never going to be like,
5193000	5197000	look out the window at all those transgender people, senator.
5197000	5201000	You know, like, there's going to be, I mean, there's 700,000,
5201000	5206000	you know, outward, out openly transgender people right now.
5206000	5208000	And there's, you can probably, there's a lot of people.
5208000	5210000	I'm just saying like, we can't keep waiting for this.
5210000	5213000	They're like this little tiny key that could unravel the whole thing
5213000	5218000	because the, John Oliver just did this piece on his show
5218000	5220000	about the whole transgender thing.
5220000	5223000	And it really just, again, like flip-flopped my brain about everything.
5223000	5226000	Because like, we're, it's one thing to talk about this culturally,
5226000	5230000	but now it's like, there's laws, they're passing laws in different places
5230000	5234000	that you have to use the bathroom that corresponds to the genitalia
5234000	5238000	that you were born with, not the gender that you identify with.
5238000	5242000	So they're, and they're running ads for like these local referendums
5242000	5247000	that are like, they'll show a little girl going into a women's room
5247000	5251000	and then a dude with a baseball cap and a goatee looking around
5251000	5253000	and then going into the women's room after her
5253000	5256000	and saying, this is what you're voting for.
5256000	5260000	Because the idea is that if you identify as a,
5260000	5263000	the idea is that that guy in the baseball cap can say,
5263000	5267000	I identify as a woman, so I'm going to go molest a girl in the bathroom.
5267000	5269000	Like as if that's the slippery slope we're on.
5269000	5273000	And my point is, there's torturous things happening to people
5273000	5277000	who represent really the end all be all of like the final thresholds
5277000	5279000	that we really thought we could call thresholds.
5279000	5283000	And I think what you're saying is that macro statement,
5283000	5286000	like we can live in the macro, we have the capacity for it.
5286000	5288000	We're primates, we can do it.
5288000	5294000	And the guy in the four agreements said the same thing.
5294000	5298000	Our brains are designed to experience everything at the same time.
5298000	5299000	And we're back.
5299000	5302000	Our brains are not designed to have,
5302000	5306000	they don't have to always have like this flashlight beam
5306000	5310000	that only shines on one thing and thinks about one thing at once.
5310000	5314000	We can think a million things at once and we can definitely think like,
5314000	5320000	well, let's, for instance, you could definitely decide as a society to go,
5320000	5322000	well, let's make sure everybody's happy.
5322000	5325000	Like you could build that as the bottom foundation
5325000	5327000	and you could build everything else on top of it.
5327000	5332000	But we're living in a world that was created like so long ago
5332000	5336000	by people that didn't even see these days coming when these questions,
5336000	5339000	we would have the luxury of asking these questions.
5339000	5342000	But I don't know, I just got excited when you said that
5342000	5345000	because I was thinking about that piece and feeling the guilt inside of me
5345000	5351000	and going like, oh my God, well, that's what this transgender concept
5351000	5355000	is doing to people right now is like we're all going,
5355000	5360000	oh, I don't know, I've heard myself say out loud like,
5360000	5363000	oh, come on, you know, like about various things,
5363000	5365000	like I thought that's where you could draw the line like,
5365000	5366000	well, give me a break.
5366000	5369000	And it's like, well, why are you drawing the line there?
5369000	5371000	And it's like, well, take that line away and take that line away
5371000	5372000	and take that line away.
5372000	5374000	What do you think the worst case scenario is
5374000	5377000	where everything is just how people want it to be?
5377000	5380000	Like what do you think would happen?
5380000	5384000	And I just wanted to co-opt what you were saying
5384000	5387000	and turn it into a transgender piece.
5387000	5389000	But I feel like that's a skeleton key.
5389000	5390000	Is it television?
5390000	5392000	It's a redefinition of television, one of the things that's helping that
5392000	5396000	because it used to be that there were only certain programs on,
5396000	5400000	so there were only certain shadings of people that you saw.
5400000	5402000	And then you would meet, you'd go out in the world,
5402000	5404000	especially your adventures, you leave your town,
5404000	5409000	and you meet these people whose only experience with somebody like you is never.
5409000	5411000	They've never seen anybody like you.
5411000	5414000	But what they relate to it via generalization is,
5414000	5417000	oh, Raj on what's happening or something like that.
5417000	5420000	And they think, oh, this guy must like this and this.
5420000	5425000	I still to this day, if I go into a footlock or something,
5425000	5427000	this is not to call them out, but it's happened to everybody.
5427000	5428000	I'm a winner.
5428000	5431000	And they just poke there, and I poke my head in,
5431000	5432000	and they're like, how's it going, sir?
5432000	5433000	How's it going, sir?
5433000	5435000	Hey, bro, what can I do for you?
5435000	5437000	And this is not...
5437000	5441000	Their logo is literally black and white.
5441000	5443000	You think they have everything you want?
5443000	5444000	There was a footlocker.
5444000	5446000	I went to see a movie, and I walked past the footlock.
5446000	5447000	I didn't even go in it.
5447000	5452000	And they were giving away Michael Jordan cologne with a bonus prize,
5452000	5453000	and the guy's talking.
5453000	5455000	And I can hear them in the walk-up talking to everybody.
5455000	5457000	I already know in my head, A, I love you, Michael Jordan,
5457000	5459000	but I'm not going to buy your cologne,
5459000	5461000	because I have David Beckham's cologne.
5461000	5465000	But I'm walking past it, and the dude...
5465000	5466000	It's called Instinct, by the way, and it's amazing.
5466000	5468000	It has a magnetic cap.
5468000	5469000	Are you wearing it now?
5469000	5470000	No, no, no.
5470000	5471000	I'm wearing a combination of other stuff.
5471000	5475000	So I walked past it.
5479000	5481000	Are you going to give us a breakdown?
5481000	5482000	It's not on the wrist today.
5482000	5484000	Is that racist?
5484000	5485000	It's probably faded.
5485000	5486000	It's very subtle.
5488000	5489000	I think I'm in love.
5489000	5491000	The guys at the table...
5491000	5493000	Did you make it back?
5494000	5497000	The guys at the table turned to me and said,
5497000	5499000	try Michael Jordan cologne today.
5499000	5501000	And I just said, guys, no, I'm not.
5501000	5504000	And before I could finish that, the one on the end said,
5504000	5506000	you get a free basketball.
5507000	5509000	Because they were giving away red and black Michael Jordan
5509000	5510000	basketballs for the thing.
5510000	5511000	And I just looked at him.
5511000	5514000	I walked over, and I go, if you ever, in your lifetime,
5514000	5517000	ever see me again, do not speak to me
5517000	5520000	or say the word basketball to anybody around me
5520000	5521000	within a 300 yard radius.
5521000	5523000	Are you out of your fucking mind?
5523000	5524000	And I just sort of walked up.
5524000	5525000	And that was just my...
5525000	5526000	I was just pissed.
5526000	5527000	It was a rage moment.
5527000	5528000	I didn't need to...
5528000	5529000	But you know what that is.
5529000	5531000	Obviously, since it was part of a promotion,
5531000	5533000	you're guaranteed you know that they weren't.
5533000	5535000	But they offered nobody in the walk-up to me
5535000	5537000	a basketball as an incentive.
5537000	5538000	Oh, they were picking and choosing.
5538000	5539000	Yeah, it was a Beverly Center.
5539000	5540000	They never...
5540000	5541000	Yeah, the Beverly Center.
5541000	5542000	It was like one of the...
5542000	5543000	Never...
5543000	5544000	But I'm the last guy in,
5544000	5545000	and the basketball became part of the incentive.
5545000	5546000	And I was just like, man,
5546000	5548000	maybe the word wasn't basketball.
5548000	5549000	Maybe it was free.
5549000	5550000	I don't know.
5550000	5552000	It just unlocks the key that makes it right.
5552000	5553000	I want a free basketball.
5553000	5554000	Well, it was like...
5554000	5555000	It was like you could...
5555000	5556000	I would love a free basketball.
5556000	5558000	Dude, get over there.
5558000	5561000	But you're saying they wouldn't get me one, right?
5561000	5562000	They wouldn't offer to you,
5562000	5563000	but you would get it.
5563000	5564000	It's part of the deal.
5564000	5565000	Yeah, yeah.
5565000	5566000	The cologne would be the thing to do.
5566000	5567000	But they didn't put that in the pitch.
5567000	5568000	No.
5568000	5569000	Not to anybody in the walk-up.
5569000	5570000	But no, it would be...
5570000	5574000	The idea would be you can turn down the cologne,
5574000	5579000	but you can't possibly turn down the free basketball.
5579000	5580000	QED.
5580000	5581000	Yeah.
5581000	5583000	It all comes down to dehumanization.
5583000	5584000	That's always the theme.
5584000	5588000	Again, that's the skeleton key aspect of the transgender thing
5588000	5591000	is because it's people going,
5591000	5596000	I choose this even though it's difficult for me
5596000	5597000	and all this stuff,
5597000	5601000	because it might be our final invitation
5601000	5603000	to realize that everything leading up to it
5603000	5605000	has always been about dehumanization,
5605000	5608000	whether you're laughing about people being grouped together
5608000	5610000	with certain characteristics or something like that.
5610000	5613000	The final thing is we can do all of that
5613000	5615000	any time we want as long as everybody understands
5615000	5619000	that every individual you see is always an individual
5619000	5621000	and you can't make any assumptions about them.
5621000	5624000	And it's being hammered into our brains.
5624000	5626000	And the harder the hammer gets pounded,
5626000	5628000	the more I feel myself,
5628000	5631000	like my system goes into a shock,
5631000	5632000	and then I relax and I'm like,
5632000	5633000	oh, thanks.
5633000	5635000	That got hammered in.
5635000	5638000	Keep hammering it and hammering it and hammering it
5638000	5640000	until I can finally look around
5640000	5644000	and only see individuals and never shake this thing
5644000	5647000	where we're thinking, well, you know, the Irish.
5647000	5650000	And it's like, why? Because it comforts us.
5650000	5652000	It gives us understanding of a world full of people.
5652000	5653000	People scare us.
5653000	5655000	And we go like, you laugh with your friends
5655000	5657000	and go like, ah, that fucking Irish.
5657000	5658000	You know, he's Irish.
5658000	5660000	I thought I was Irish for 20 years.
5660000	5662000	I just found out I'm fucking British.
5663000	5665000	All right, let's move on.
5665000	5668000	We did our weird Springer's final thoughts segment
5668000	5671000	of the thing.
5671000	5674000	I wonder if in, like, in the upcoming weeks
5674000	5677000	we're going to see more of Ty Brixton.
5677000	5680000	I hope he comes back to the show.
5680000	5683000	All right, so, yeah, and then speaking of individuals
5683000	5685000	and dehumanization and stuff,
5685000	5686000	we've had this outgoing conversation,
5686000	5687000	but this is one of those nights.
5687000	5689000	We've had nothing but men up on stage.
5689000	5692000	And I think, and she doesn't, this is the important key.
5692000	5695000	She doesn't have to play Mercy O'Donnell necessarily,
5695000	5699000	but we should get, we need one helper up here, right?
5699000	5705000	And I say, make it a lady with my proactive campaign.
5705000	5708000	I'm wearing a police skirt.
5708000	5710000	All right, well, I mean, you spoke up.
5710000	5713000	That's enough.
5713000	5715000	Come on up.
5716000	5719000	Right.
5723000	5726000	It's important to my relationship with my wife
5726000	5728000	that it's not because of the skirt,
5728000	5730000	it's just because of the volition.
5730000	5731000	What's your name?
5731000	5732000	Darcy.
5732000	5733000	Hello, Darcy, how are you?
5733000	5734000	I'm doing well.
5734000	5735000	I'm excited to be here.
5735000	5736000	Thanks, everyone.
5736000	5739000	All right, so we got enough people, right?
5739000	5742000	Yep, we got enough people.
5742000	5745000	Darcy, you have an awesome Artudito tattoo on your left arm.
5745000	5746000	Yes, I do. Thank you.
5746000	5747000	It's very well done.
5747000	5750000	I also have Bender, and I also have...
5750000	5751000	Thank you.
5751000	5752000	I have to take off my clothes.
5752000	5753000	I just realized.
5753000	5755000	I also have the, I have tattoos.
5755000	5757000	What's your weirdest one?
5757000	5758000	My weirdest one?
5758000	5759000	Yeah.
5759000	5763000	Probably the, shit, man, I don't know.
5763000	5764000	None of them are super weird.
5764000	5766000	I have my Bender, probably.
5766000	5767000	Do you have a tattoo that you're correct?
5767000	5768000	I asked my brother.
5768000	5769000	Yes, I have.
5769000	5770000	My brother's 20 tattoos.
5770000	5773000	He regrets none of them.
5773000	5779000	Yes, when I was 22, I got divorced, and I got a back tattoo in Japanese.
5779000	5781000	It means freedom.
5781000	5786000	So, yeah, one day I'll get it covered, and I'll be all right.
5786000	5787000	Like a tramp stamp?
5787000	5788000	Yes, yes, tramp stamp.
5788000	5789000	Freedom, I love it.
5789000	5790000	Freedom.
5790000	5795000	I just realized that there might be somebody that hasn't seen the show before,
5795000	5797000	and we haven't explained what we're doing.
5797000	5802000	These Manila folders are coming out, and they're like, are they going to eat me?
5802000	5805000	It's tax time again.
5805000	5811000	Are they going to start praying and then dip me into a cauldron of stew?
5811000	5813000	Darcy, you're hip to the jive, right?
5813000	5815000	You know what our Shadowrun is, right?
5815000	5816000	Vaguely?
5816000	5819000	Yes, I'm a little behind because I have a lot of podcasts,
5819000	5821000	but I do know what Shadowrun is.
5821000	5824000	You're on a lot of podcasts, or you listen to a lot of podcasts?
5824000	5825000	I wish.
5826000	5828000	No, I listen to a lot of podcasts.
5828000	5830000	What's your favorite one?
5830000	5833000	Well, I love Harman Town.
5833000	5835000	I got to catch Dead Authors.
5835000	5839000	I'm from out of town, so this is my first Harman Town.
5839000	5843000	That's why I felt free to shout.
5843000	5846000	Yes, let me do it.
5846000	5849000	And I'm a little shaky.
5849000	5853000	I love Dead Authors, and they're stopping soon, so I was able to catch that.
5854000	5855000	I didn't get the name of that.
5855000	5856000	Dead Authors.
5856000	5858000	Dead Authors, podcasts with Paul F. Tompkins.
5858000	5859000	Paul? You know Paul.
5859000	5861000	Our friend Matt Groly does it a bunch.
5861000	5863000	Yeah, I wish he'd been there. I love him.
5863000	5865000	I'll tell him he said so.
5869000	5875000	Throwing Shade, Judge John Hodgman, Lady to Lady.
5875000	5876000	What am I on a lot?
5876000	5879000	Oh, Comedy Bang Bang I love, of course.
5879000	5880000	All right.
5880000	5881000	You ready to rock and roll, Darcy?
5881000	5882000	Let's try.
5882000	5883000	Spencer, do we have a guest announcer?
5883000	5887000	Yeah, this one was guest recapper John from LA.
5887000	5888000	You ready to go?
5888000	5890000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5897000	5898000	Last run.
5898000	5899000	Oh, sorry.
5899000	5901000	I'll let you finish.
5901000	5902000	Fuck, Jeff.
5902000	5903000	Wait, start it over, man.
5903000	5905000	That was fucked up.
5905000	5906000	That was fucked up.
5906000	5909000	I thought he wasn't going to go, and right when I did...
5909000	5910000	Whoa, whoa, he started talking.
5910000	5911000	See ya.
5911000	5912000	That was fucked up.
5912000	5915000	You just had the same instinct to go right at the right moment.
5915000	5916000	Right, yeah.
5916000	5918000	The one I was going to go at.
5918000	5920000	I mean, it's a natural instinct.
5922000	5924000	You see, you can't do it.
5925000	5930000	Last run on Shadow Time, Harman Town, Time Shadow.
5930000	5936000	We last saw the gang at Jim Nightblade's apartment engaged in a standoff with Jesse Yellowman.
5936000	5941000	Jesse, a street samurai, and the protege of captured scientist Baldwin Brown
5941000	5945000	was trying to convince the team to forfeit their pay data,
5945000	5949000	warning of dire consequences if they failed to do so.
5949000	5953000	Nightblade fired his grappling gun out the window for no reason,
5953000	5955000	and then a firefight ensued.
5955000	5959000	Hordegard was able to subdue Jesse with a blast of shock ammo from his rifle,
5959000	5966000	allowing the team to tie up the incapacitated vigilante for delivery to their mysterious Johnson.
5966000	5969000	Then Eve Libertine started operating landscaping equipment
5969000	5972000	and farting because this show is improvised.
5973000	5977000	Will the team manage to get paid, or will their employer double-cross them?
5977000	5979000	Find out...
5984000	5985000	Thank you, Spencer.
5985000	5986000	Yeah, man.
5990000	5993000	And thanks again to John from L.A.
5993000	5997000	As always, I spent the recap going like,
5997000	5999000	Did I talk about race too much?
5999000	6003000	So I didn't listen at all, so I have no idea what...
6003000	6008000	We took Jesse Yellowman captive to give him to our Johnson as a show of good faith.
6008000	6009000	Oh, we got him.
6009000	6011000	We have him all tied up, right?
6011000	6013000	He's knocked out and tied up, yeah.
6013000	6017000	Alright, so let's take him back to the Johnson and say,
6017000	6019000	Look, this is what happens.
6019000	6025000	Sometimes people offer us more money to double-cross you.
6025000	6027000	We're saying, Fuck that shit.
6027000	6028000	We got the guy.
6028000	6029000	Sorry my voice is gone.
6033000	6036000	You know, two things occur to me.
6037000	6038000	One is...
6038000	6040000	Is this going to be about race?
6040000	6043000	No, it's like 2075.
6043000	6046000	I'm like 30% Cherokee.
6048000	6050000	Uh...
6051000	6052000	The...
6053000	6054000	30?
6056000	6058000	It skips a generation.
6063000	6066000	One is the simple code of the street samurai, which says,
6066000	6067000	You know, this guy kind of...
6067000	6073000	I tried to stun him and he was faster and kind of feel like a chump bringing him in.
6074000	6076000	The other is, what if he's...
6076000	6083000	You know, he's talking a lot of stuff about how the stakes are, you know, kind of big.
6084000	6086000	He's saying we're...
6086000	6088000	You know, we're dealing with something like...
6088000	6090000	I don't know, man, I keep going back and forth about this.
6090000	6095000	I guess I'm not really a good shadow runner or a good thinker.
6096000	6098000	Maybe we could...
6098000	6103000	Maybe we could split the diff and set the guy free without, you know, totally fucking him over.
6103000	6107000	Our rationale was that we got to do our job, but this ain't our job.
6107000	6110000	You know, turn and snitch on a fucking fellow...
6111000	6112000	Shit, shatter.
6112000	6113000	Why don't we like...
6114000	6115000	Here's a pitch.
6115000	6119000	Why don't we take him and leave him somewhere safe with a little note.
6119000	6122000	Like we write a little note that says, look, we could have turned you over.
6122000	6123000	We didn't.
6124000	6125000	Like a warning.
6125000	6126000	Yeah.
6127000	6135000	We're not going to turn you in and get you in trouble, but, you know, just leave it be and let him know that we were cool about it.
6135000	6139000	Why don't we take a look at some of these files of somebody that knows what they mean, you know, too.
6139000	6144000	I agree with that, but also let's take a look at what we're handing over to the man.
6144000	6146000	Nobody said we couldn't do that.
6146000	6147000	You know what I'm saying?
6149000	6150000	What files? I'm sorry.
6150000	6152000	The files we got from Baldwin Brown.
6152000	6153000	Yeah, let's check them out.
6154000	6155000	Okay.
6155000	6156000	Somebody smart here.
6158000	6159000	Mercy, Mercy, you're smart.
6160000	6161000	Oh, yes.
6161000	6164000	Let me look at these files that I have.
6164000	6166000	What the fuck is in the files?
6166000	6168000	They're on a dated ship.
6168000	6170000	You find it's encrypted.
6170000	6171000	Some high level stuff.
6171000	6174000	It's going to take a real hacker to figure this out.
6174000	6175000	Shit.
6175000	6176000	We need HackEye.
6176000	6177000	Is HackEye with us?
6177000	6178000	No.
6178000	6179000	Shit.
6180000	6181000	HackEye, can we...
6181000	6182000	Go ahead. Sorry.
6182000	6183000	HackEye's not with us.
6183000	6184000	Yeah, I know.
6184000	6185000	Talking to him on the phone.
6185000	6186000	Oh, you got him?
6186000	6187000	You guys talk to him.
6187000	6188000	I talk too much.
6188000	6189000	No, no, you talk.
6189000	6190000	You talk.
6190000	6191000	No, let Mercy talk to him.
6191000	6193000	HackEye, hey, what's up?
6193000	6194000	How you doing?
6194000	6195000	Where you at?
6195000	6197000	I'm at home.
6200000	6201000	All right.
6201000	6202000	Oh, cool.
6202000	6205000	So where's home at?
6205000	6207000	Where are we in relation to your home?
6207000	6208000	Don't worry about that.
6208000	6209000	How can...
6209000	6211000	What do you need?
6211000	6213000	We need to unencrypt these files.
6213000	6214000	Yeah.
6214000	6216000	Can I send you a file then, man?
6216000	6218000	Because we got to unencrypt this stuff,
6218000	6220000	and it's really, really important.
6220000	6221000	Yeah.
6221000	6223000	Just upload it to the matrix.
6223000	6224000	Hold on.
6224000	6226000	Hang on a joke.
6227000	6230000	Portagot would argue against taking the secret files
6230000	6233000	that we have gone through so much trouble to acquire
6233000	6236000	and then just making them open to everyone to see.
6237000	6240000	What I might suggest is that if you can convince him
6240000	6241000	to be amenable to the idea,
6241000	6244000	perhaps we could either arrange to have a car sent to him
6244000	6246000	if he could give the specific details and digits
6246000	6247000	of what he needs.
6247000	6250000	Otherwise, I could possibly track his location
6250000	6252000	using some sort of combination of skills
6252000	6254000	and mechanisms that I have.
6254000	6258000	Otherwise, we could get him and bring him to us.
6259000	6261000	Who are you talking to?
6262000	6264000	I'm speaking to the group.
6264000	6266000	As a suggestion to my colleagues.
6266000	6269000	I mean, we're sending him an encrypted file, right?
6269000	6272000	Is that not safe to send over the matrix?
6272000	6274000	Well, there are other encryptors in the world.
6274000	6276000	You're being really uptight about this.
6276000	6278000	This is my job and my lineage.
6278000	6279000	All right.
6279000	6280000	All right.
6280000	6281000	Let's get him a car.
6281000	6282000	I mean, we need it now, but okay.
6282000	6283000	Let's get him a car.
6283000	6284000	Is he amenable to the idea?
6284000	6286000	I can meet you at Hank's last stand.
6286000	6287000	All right.
6287000	6288000	Let's do it.
6288000	6289000	Let's go.
6289000	6290000	Let's go to Hank's.
6290000	6291000	Yeah.
6297000	6298000	You arrive at Hank's last stand.
6298000	6300000	Later, at the Hall of Justice.
6301000	6305000	You pile out of the Uber and into the dark comfort
6305000	6307000	of the old moldy bar.
6307000	6310000	You see Hank cleaning his glass as usual.
6310000	6313000	A hot guy, not a hot guy.
6313000	6316000	A hot guy is in the corner, his corner,
6316000	6318000	his usual corner, waiting.
6318000	6320000	Well, we never discussed what we were going to do
6320000	6322000	with pinky yellow man.
6322000	6323000	Yeah.
6323000	6324000	Oh, yeah.
6324000	6325000	Back in time.
6327000	6331000	I mean, he's tied up in the car out front, right?
6331000	6333000	Did we crack a window for him?
6335000	6338000	My pitch would have been let's restrain him
6338000	6340000	and put him in the trunk.
6340000	6341000	Yeah.
6341000	6342000	Yeah, yeah.
6342000	6343000	Of the Uber?
6343000	6344000	Oh, shit.
6344000	6345000	Yeah, it's an Uber.
6345000	6346000	Fuck.
6346000	6347000	We put him in the trunk of the Uber.
6347000	6350000	We say to the driver, like, leave to me to run.
6350000	6351000	Yeah, okay.
6351000	6352000	That works.
6352000	6353000	Yeah.
6353000	6354000	All right.
6354000	6355000	All right, Mercy.
6355000	6356000	Mercy, go talk to HackEye.
6356000	6360000	Give him the encrypted data and talk your talk.
6361000	6362000	Hey, HackGuy.
6362000	6363000	Hey.
6363000	6364000	Hey, you got a drink?
6364000	6365000	Can I get you a drink?
6365000	6366000	Oh, I'm fine.
6366000	6367000	How's it going?
6367000	6368000	What do you need from me, HackGuy?
6368000	6370000	Well, we need you to be HackGuy.
6370000	6371000	We need you to do your thing
6371000	6375000	because we've got this data.
6375000	6376000	Excuse me.
6376000	6380000	We've got this data chip, and we need it unencrypted because...
6380000	6381000	Yeah, you do.
6381000	6382000	Stuff.
6382000	6383000	Give it to me.
6383000	6384000	I'll take it.
6384000	6385000	I'll take a look at it.
6385000	6386000	I'll give it to you.
6386000	6387000	So...
6388000	6392000	Wait, is there a Will They, Won't They thing going on with Mercy and HackGuy?
6392000	6393000	I know, is there?
6393000	6394000	I don't know.
6394000	6396000	It seems like you guys are getting a little sweaty over there.
6396000	6398000	This is my bedroom voice.
6398000	6408000	I go to the jukebox and put on some sexy R&B.
6408000	6412000	And I'm at the bar with Dr. Friend, and I just...
6412000	6420000	I go, so what do you make of all this shadow running?
6420000	6421000	I don't know, man.
6421000	6427000	I have to tell you, as long as I do no harm, I'm okay.
6427000	6431000	It's got to become increasingly hard in this world.
6431000	6437000	It's becoming increasingly hard now, especially with...
6437000	6444000	I turn the music up on the sexy R&B.
6444000	6447000	There are a lot of things I haven't talked about with you.
6447000	6452000	Listen, it's getting really hard for me, too.
6452000	6460000	So you can trust me and talk to me.
6460000	6462000	Hey, man, I'm like you.
6462000	6464000	I don't think you are, man.
6464000	6466000	I don't think you have a clue.
6466000	6468000	I used to be legit.
6468000	6472000	I fell down to this world, fell from grace, lost my wings.
6472000	6477000	Oh, no, I thought you meant about me being gay.
6482000	6488000	How the God goes to the jukebox and plays the next selection,
6488000	6491000	which is Luto Vanjros.
6491000	6494000	Never enough.
6494000	6501000	Well, I mean, look, if we're going there on the Kinsey scale,
6501000	6510000	truth be told, I call myself 50-50.
6511000	6515000	I'm a little more than that.
6515000	6519000	You know, we've been going on these shadow runs for a long time.
6519000	6521000	I've been keeping everything kind of low,
6521000	6526000	but I have to tell you that I'm dealing with feelings about you.
6526000	6528000	Oh, shit.
6528000	6531000	I mean, you in particular.
6531000	6533000	Well, I'm just telling you, you don't have to say anything.
6533000	6535000	I'm just letting you know.
6535000	6539000	No, no, I appreciate your transparency.
6539000	6542000	I figured you should know.
6542000	6543000	Please don't tell anybody.
6543000	6545000	It's just between us.
6545000	6546000	Of course.
6546000	6548000	I respect nothing more than privacy.
6548000	6556000	That's why I got into this business.
6556000	6557000	You know what?
6557000	6558000	I'm a precog.
6558000	6562000	I can sense your look and everything about it.
6562000	6564000	What are you guys talking about over there?
6564000	6569000	Nobody else has the mission.
6569000	6570000	How are guys still working on it?
6570000	6572000	Have we found anything out yet?
6572000	6573000	Oh, yeah.
6573000	6575000	I'm just pouring through this DATAS.
6575000	6577000	It was seriously...
6577000	6583000	Guess we're all pouring through a lot of DATAS.
6583000	6588000	Gently night blade. Gently.
6588000	6589000	What does it say?
6589000	6591000	It says all sorts of stuff.
6591000	6593000	It talks about BTL chips.
6593000	6596000	Those hot new drugs that kids are using these days.
6596000	6599000	Talks about the mechanisms by which they damage
6599000	6602000	and degrade the neural pathways of your brain.
6602000	6605000	And it looks like Baldwin Brown has been doing some research
6605000	6607000	on how to reverse that damage.
6607000	6609000	We're talking crazy BTLs.
6609000	6612000	Imagine if you could just do mountains of cocaine all day
6612000	6614000	and wake up fresh as a daisy.
6614000	6616000	That's what they're bringing.
6616000	6618000	That's what this research is about.
6618000	6621000	No downsides to drugs.
6621000	6625000	So somebody who had these files could either...
6625000	6631000	I mean, what's the... I don't know.
6631000	6633000	It sounds like if you're removing the bad side
6633000	6636000	of a dangerous drug,
6636000	6639000	I don't really see a downside to giving it to Baldwin Brown.
6639000	6641000	No, it seems pretty standard.
6641000	6643000	You just fix these neural pathways in the brain
6643000	6645000	and everything's healthy.
6645000	6647000	The question is...
6651000	6653000	The people that we give this information to,
6653000	6655000	do they want it because they want to use it
6655000	6657000	or suppress it?
6657000	6659000	Well, you know, they used to.
6664000	6666000	Cliffhanger!
6670000	6672000	Thank you, Darcy.
6672000	6674000	Darcy, everybody.
6676000	6678000	DuBois Brown.
6681000	6683000	Curtis Armstrong.
6686000	6688000	Spencer Crittenden.
6690000	6694000	Ty Brixton, the embittered three-foot-tall promoter.
6696000	6700000	I'm Jeff Davis, your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6706000	6708000	Thank you, y'all.
6711000	6713000	Did you get any of that?
6714000	6716000	It's a good show!
