0	5000	Minneapolis! Welcome!
5000	8000	Carment Town is now in session.
8000	10000	Please welcome to the stage
10000	12000	the person who is going to make this night
12000	15000	the best night of your life, Mr. Dan Harmon!
15000	17000	Carment Town is now in session.
17000	19000	Please welcome to the stage
19000	22000	the best night of your life, Mr. Dan Harmon!
34000	37000	Twin Town!
37000	39000	I'm sure that's what they call it.
39000	41000	Twin Town.
41000	43000	You know, they call it the Twin City, right?
43000	46000	It's a portion of identical twins per capita.
46000	49000	It's some kind of, I think it's the power lines.
49000	51000	Oh.
51000	55000	It affects the genetics of the sperms and the ova.
55000	57000	But they're happy. They're happy people that way.
57000	62000	They look very happy and very good looking!
62000	65000	Half of them are very good looking.
65000	67000	The other half are fortunate enough
67000	71000	to look exactly like those people.
71000	75000	And they never know which half is just riding the coattails.
75000	77000	And they have frequent arguments about it
77000	81000	during what they call the Festival Hour.
88000	90000	Don't mind my sound effects?
92000	96000	Just every time you say Festival Hour, you'll hear it gong.
96000	98000	Okay. All right.
98000	104000	Well, I appreciate the added layer of sound effects.
104000	108000	I'm not giving a note, but I don't know if being a 28-year-old
108000	112000	you're familiar with the history of the gong and entertainment.
112000	114000	It's the...
114000	118000	It has a sort of legacy.
118000	120000	It's the noise of festivals.
120000	122000	Right.
123000	126000	Erin McGathey, Comptroller, everybody.
126000	128000	I'm excited about it.
128000	130000	Thanks, Scott.
130000	134000	I just noticed that there's a camera on my face.
134000	136000	Documentaries.
136000	138000	Yeah.
138000	140000	We're making a movie here, too.
140000	143000	You're all in it. Your little shadowy faces.
143000	146000	Did they put a camera on anyone's head in the front row?
146000	148000	Sometimes they do that.
148000	150000	I notice it halfway through the show,
150000	152000	and then I want them to...
152000	154000	They should take five bucks off the ticket
154000	158000	for the guy that has to wear a camera on his head.
158000	160000	I've worn that thing.
160000	163000	It's like a jock strap on your head.
163000	165000	It hurts. I wore it in New York,
165000	167000	and you told me I looked like a Cloud Atlas character
167000	169000	because I pushed all my skin down.
169000	173000	Yeah. It looked like Holly Berry when she was the old Chinese man.
175000	177000	Chaka from Land of the Lost.
177000	179000	The crazy thing about wearing that in New York,
179000	181000	no one mentioned that.
181000	183000	Everyone came up to the merch table and was like,
183000	186000	yeah, hey, I'm gonna get a T-shirt and a thing.
186000	189000	Everyone's so used to having cameras on them.
189000	191000	Twin Town!
192000	194000	Twin Town Rap.
194000	195000	All right.
195000	197000	Twin Town Rap!
197000	199000	Whoo!
207000	209000	Two cities right next to each other.
209000	211000	Even buildings can have sisters and brothers.
211000	214000	Got two towns that can go to either one.
214000	216000	I fucked your mama like a hot dog bun.
216000	219000	Put my wiener inside, put my mustard on top.
219000	221000	Fucked your mama like a broom and a mop.
221000	222000	Clean your pussy out.
222000	224000	Made room for more.
224000	226000	Fucked your mama on the ceiling and the floor.
226000	228000	Fucked your mama.
228000	230000	Yeah.
230000	232000	That was good. That was good.
232000	234000	God damn it.
234000	237000	I'm getting really good at rapping.
240000	242000	There was like eight...
242000	244000	Yay, festival!
247000	249000	All right, it's a new tradition.
251000	254000	Yeah, there were like eight things that rhymed in there.
254000	256000	That was very good. That was really good.
256000	259000	None of them were mouth and south.
260000	263000	And you really used your floor space.
263000	265000	Yeah, I'm getting good at dancing too.
265000	268000	I'm getting really good at dancing and rapping.
268000	271000	I started the tour just going like this.
271000	276000	But now I kind of like put some stopping and starting into it.
276000	278000	Like I'm going to go somewhere.
281000	282000	Amazing.
282000	286000	I get out of breath sooner though doing that because it's like a treadmill.
288000	289000	Jesus Christ.
289000	291000	Dan's a great dancer though.
291000	297000	Before we were dating, there was a night that we spent last New Year's with Jeff Davis
297000	299000	and he put on a song and asked you to dance to it.
299000	301000	It's a surfer baby, surfer girl.
301000	303000	Surfer baby's not a song.
303000	305000	Little surfer girl.
305000	306000	Little surfer girl.
306000	309000	Dan put on a little dress and danced around the living room very sensuously.
309000	311000	I'm sorry, Dan.
311000	314000	I mean, it sounds weird on paper.
314000	315000	I'm doing...
315000	317000	Okay, so what?
317000	322000	Why on your way to a comedy show load up your iPad with gongs and fog horns?
322000	324000	Your boyfriend's show.
324000	327000	Let's see, do I got everything in here that I want?
327000	329000	A rim shot?
329000	331000	Fuck that.
331000	332000	Who needs that?
332000	334000	I'm sorry.
335000	338000	Was that a baby crying?
338000	342000	Yeah, it's a baby crying because everyone loves the milk of the show.
346000	347000	Baby crying.
347000	351000	The baby crying reminds everyone that the show is like milk that you need when you're
351000	355000	a baby and you can only digest breast milk and that's the idea.
355000	356000	Right, right.
356000	362000	I thought it was a six million year old sound that makes people uncomfortable.
362000	369000	I thought that it was a primal, instinctive, people-upsetter because it means that one
369000	374000	of our species, larva, is exposed to a saber-tooth tiger.
374000	379000	You know that babies cry like that because human babies, they don't have fur.
379000	384000	Our primate cousins, they're covered with this thick layer of fur like orangutan babies.
384000	391000	The babies, they come out and they basically just cling to the mom like her fur.
392000	395000	They walk around, they just clung there forever.
395000	400000	It's like a little baby bjorn until the baby finally lets go and starts doing its own thing.
400000	403000	A lot of our primates have similar things like that.
403000	405000	They just cling and wrap around.
405000	407000	Tell me more about it.
413000	416000	Primates, monkey super monkeys.
417000	420000	Pretty funky, got a big old brain up in their monkey head.
420000	424000	Don't fight, they think it's dead, they make fire.
424000	428000	Sorry, I guess that was great, but you gave me a look like that was a mistake.
428000	429000	Yay!
430000	434000	I don't know if Jeff would have cued a wrap-up at that point.
436000	437000	I was headlining to-
437000	439000	You're right, I give myself this noise.
447000	450000	It's the noise of someone alone at a party.
451000	453000	Okay, reset.
454000	459000	Anyways, babies cry because, yeah, they're moms.
461000	463000	Fucked up my flow, man.
463000	464000	I'm sorry.
464000	466000	A human baby just has an instinct.
466000	468000	If you walk away from it, it just starts crying.
468000	472000	As soon as it loses sight of a big person to protect it, it just starts crying.
472000	475000	Which on one hand is a horrible thing because they draw predators.
475000	479000	But human babies require constant protection from the parents.
479000	483000	And so the baby has a catastrophic response to the absence of its adult guardians.
483000	486000	And the game of peek-a-boo, I always talk about this,
486000	491000	is the mom hides her face from the baby,
491000	496000	which the baby instinctively is designed to recognize as a catastrophe,
496000	498000	that the face is gone.
498000	505000	But kind of senses, I think I can see the Brechtian narrative here.
507000	509000	I can see that she's still there, but I lost the face.
509000	512000	And then the mom opens the face and goes like,
512000	513000	Peek-a-boo.
513000	515000	And the baby goes, wait, she knows?
515000	521000	She knows that I wanted to die, and she's fucking around with it.
521000	524000	It must not be that big a deal.
525000	530000	It's like that first time you see Mel Brooks do a Hitler joke, you know?
530000	535000	You kind of just get a big belly laugh and you...
536000	540000	Okay, we have to talk about...
540000	543000	I don't understand what you brought in your sound effects arsenal
543000	545000	and what your intention was.
545000	550000	There's a doctor named Dr. Sound Effects.
550000	553000	First of all, that's not true.
553000	556000	There's probably a website called Dr. Sound Effects,
556000	561000	but I don't think anyone's ever gotten a PhD in what you're doing right now.
562000	565000	Okay, I'll cool it on the sound effects.
565000	568000	No, you don't have to do that. I'd like you to refine your targeting.
568000	570000	I don't? Well...
570000	572000	I mean, a slide whistle?
572000	573000	Sorry, that was a bad...
573000	574000	Okay, that's a dog whiny.
574000	575000	No, I'll really cool it.
575000	576000	That's a puppy being stepped on.
576000	578000	Hey, do you have rabbit skinning in there?
579000	582000	I was going to tell my duck joke.
585000	587000	She's a good kid.
588000	590000	She's having a good time.
591000	596000	Hey, I want to bring Spencer out sooner than later.
598000	600000	Bring out Spencer!
600000	605000	Advanced third edition Spencer Crittenden.
609000	611000	What up?
611000	614000	Hey!
615000	617000	Spencer, can you believe it?
617000	619000	No.
620000	622000	Spencer has been my buddy on this tour.
622000	626000	We've done a merch together and spent a lot of time together.
626000	631000	And here I am with a bunch of sound effects making a show happen.
632000	635000	Thanks for holding down the merchandise table back there, Spencer.
635000	636000	Yeah, thank you very much, Spencer.
636000	640000	Yeah, Minneapolis is a self-lining up city, I guess.
640000	642000	You guys were great.
642000	644000	Yeah, they seem like good people.
644000	646000	I really sense that about them.
646000	649000	By this time in Madison, somebody had already, for the sixth time,
649000	651000	just gone like, Pringles!
654000	656000	Diabetes!
656000	658000	You were there because it has a podcast chat.
658000	660000	Yeah, there was...
660000	662000	Do you see it, diabetes?
663000	666000	Acoustics were bad, and then I go, what?
666000	669000	Don't cheer diabetes!
669000	672000	No one was going to.
672000	674000	Don't stop the show.
674000	678000	I mean, we welcome people with things to get off their chest,
678000	681000	but it's not a hockey game.
682000	687000	And if it was, cheering diabetes isn't competing with anyone.
687000	692000	There's no match that's going to be lost between that team and anyone.
692000	696000	So I love the idea of someone with diabetes just wanting to be represented,
696000	698000	or like someone in the audience screaming out,
698000	700000	Arthritis!
700000	703000	Do something about arthritis!
703000	706000	Kup-toodle!
706000	708000	Loops.
708000	710000	Restless leg!
711000	715000	Does anyone have an ailment that they want Dan to discuss?
719000	722000	What do you have in the front row, sir?
722000	724000	Plantar fasciitis.
724000	726000	Plantar fasciitis, is that related to...?
726000	728000	What is your name, sir?
728000	729000	I'm going to do what Jeff does.
729000	730000	What is your name?
730000	731000	I'm Tony.
731000	733000	Tony, come on up here!
733000	734000	Here, Tony.
734000	736000	Thank you.
736000	739000	Anything you don't want to talk about, you don't have to talk about it.
739000	741000	Harman Town is a safe place.
741000	743000	I appreciate that.
743000	747000	Tony, first of all, Tony is wearing a red owl t-shirt.
747000	749000	I am.
749000	753000	That was the local grocery store in Milwaukee when I was a kid.
753000	754000	I'm a kid.
754000	755000	I'm a kid.
755000	756000	I'm a kid.
756000	757000	I'm a kid.
757000	758000	I'm a kid.
758000	759000	I'm a kid.
759000	760000	I'm a kid.
760000	761000	I'm a kid.
761000	763000	It was the local grocery store in Milwaukee when I was a kid.
763000	765000	It was the local grocery store in Green Bay when I was a kid.
765000	766000	Do they still exist?
766000	771000	One, and it's in Green Bay, and it's still fighting for its existence.
771000	773000	That logo, it just stirs up.
773000	775000	I haven't seen it in so long.
775000	777000	What kind of stuff do they have at the red owl?
777000	781000	Oh, God, milk, eggs, produce, and meat.
781000	784000	You just wouldn't believe it.
784000	786000	Sometimes they put it in bags for you.
786000	787000	Yeah, yeah.
787000	788000	Incredible.
788000	790000	Isles and isles of food with fluorescent lids.
790000	795000	Is it unsuccessful because red owl kind of sounds like a hate group?
795000	797000	Don't be insulted.
797000	799000	Oh, no, no, no.
799000	802000	No, baby, open that shirt.
802000	808000	Red owl sounds more like a reverse hate group, like a kind of a militant.
808000	809000	We are the red owls.
809000	810000	We detect this neighborhood.
810000	813000	It sounds like a very wise socialist organization.
813000	814000	Yeah, we're tired.
814000	817000	Like in Latin, it says never again over the...
818000	821000	It refers to something that happened to red people or owls.
821000	823000	Never again will we let a sail pass us by.
823000	826000	The red owl refers to the...
826000	830000	Somebody spilled some milk in aisle seven, and we never forgot.
831000	833000	All right, what's plantar fasciitis?
833000	835000	I'll give you one guess.
835000	846000	It's when every piece of fungus on your foot unites in a horrible Naziistic regime.
846000	848000	The red owls are fighting.
848000	851000	No, it is foot-related, but it is not fungus-related.
851000	855000	It's severe scarring of the large tendon that runs under your foot.
855000	856000	Oh, no.
856000	860000	Yeah, and it makes you limp, and it makes you look like you're 20 years older than you actually are.
860000	861000	Wait, what do you mean?
861000	864000	You mean your gait doesn't actually have the effect on your...
864000	865000	No.
865000	866000	Do you have it?
866000	867000	Yes, I do.
867000	870000	Okay, so you're not eight.
870000	872000	You just mean it makes you walk like you're 20 years old.
872000	875000	Yeah, it gives you the hobbling gait of a 60-year-old man.
875000	876000	Can you show us?
876000	877000	Oh, Tony, you look very young.
877000	878000	Show us.
878000	879000	Thank you.
879000	881000	Give us a little runway.
881000	882000	I'm going to have him walk.
882000	886000	Well, I should give you some walking music, I guess.
886000	895000	Right now it's in remission, so I used to walk like normal people do, which was back and forth,
895000	902000	and then it struck, and sometimes you get up and you lose your foot, and it feels like this.
902000	903000	Oh.
904000	906000	Oh, because the tendon is, like, not doing what it's supposed to do.
906000	909000	No, and then so you have to sit down a lot, and people ask you,
909000	911000	why are you so lazy?
911000	914000	Oh, and you're like, fuck you, I have huskraves.
918000	921000	And they go, does that have something to do with fungus?
921000	923000	No.
923000	925000	You play that song again, you know?
925000	927000	It was really moved.
928000	932000	Tony's foot, I love you.
937000	942000	Your tendon's been eaten away.
945000	951000	But, Tony, the world shops you.
951000	959000	Don't be beaten today, double rhyme scheme.
959000	963000	That was A-B-A-B, no one was impressed, all right?
963000	965000	I was damn impressed.
965000	966000	Okay.
966000	967000	Never mind, fuck it.
967000	968000	No, you know what?
968000	970000	I have worse than plantar's fasciitis.
970000	974000	I have audience unappreciateditis.
974000	981000	I wish I just couldn't walk.
981000	985000	I can't be appreciated.
985000	988000	That's the disease that infects the lower base of the brain
988000	991000	and makes further audience applause completely jaded and meaningless.
991000	992000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
992000	995000	It definitely undermines anything you get after that.
995000	999000	It's linked to solicited applause syndrome, yeah.
999000	1001000	That's the worst disease.
1001000	1003000	Somebody should stop that.
1003000	1006000	If Dan was a revival tent preacher, someone would come up and say,
1006000	1007000	I can't walk.
1007000	1008000	He'd be like, really?
1008000	1011000	Because I had a really difficult morning.
1011000	1012000	I was really in my head.
1012000	1015000	I thought a lot about my life, and I didn't know if I've done enough so far.
1015000	1017000	Go sit down.
1017000	1020000	Well, Tony, I have a very special surprise for you.
1020000	1022000	Because here in the audience, here in Minneapolis,
1022000	1028000	Twin Town, as I call it, is a fellow castaway from an old improv troupe
1028000	1030000	I used to be in Milwaukee called the Dead Ale Wives.
1031000	1036000	One of my old comedy stage partners, Sean McKenna, is here.
1036000	1039000	Let's bring Sean McKenna to the stage.
1041000	1042000	Wait.
1042000	1043000	Sorry.
1043000	1045000	Jesus, sweetie, what is happening?
1045000	1046000	You're like...
1046000	1047000	A stroke.
1047000	1048000	Holy shit.
1048000	1049000	I'm having a stroke.
1049000	1053000	It's like the second act of Robocop 2 up here.
1053000	1058000	Just shooting fire hydrants and giving candy to bank robbers.
1059000	1061000	This is after Kane took him apart and put him together?
1061000	1064000	Don't scrutinize my knowledge of Robocop 2.
1064000	1066000	Wasn't scrutinizing, just clarify.
1066000	1067000	Here he comes.
1067000	1069000	It's when they reprogrammed him, you know, and then he was like,
1069000	1073000	you know, all of you kids could rob the store and Robocop 2 is a shitty movie.
1073000	1075000	Don't smoke.
1075000	1079000	Oh, hey, Dan, I think someone's at the door.
1079000	1081000	It's Sean McKenna.
1084000	1086000	Tony, I'll get it.
1086000	1087000	Here's the amazing thing.
1087000	1088000	Look, Tony.
1088000	1091000	Sean McKenna also can't walk.
1091000	1092000	Oh, my God.
1092000	1095000	He broke his ankles walking on ice, which is why I left.
1095000	1098000	Sean McKenna, if you don't know, is also a member of the dead alewives.
1098000	1099000	Yeah.
1101000	1106000	Thank you to the three people that ever heard of us.
1106000	1111000	Sean tonight just became the first member of the Harman Town art players.
1112000	1116000	And we should probably bring Eric Noble up, too.
1116000	1117000	He's in the audience.
1117000	1118000	Oh, hell yeah.
1118000	1119000	Yeah.
1119000	1122000	He thought he was safe back there.
1122000	1124000	Very funny, gentlemen.
1124000	1126000	Did he start Minneapolis Comedy Sports?
1126000	1127000	I can't remember which city.
1127000	1128000	He started it.
1128000	1129000	Yeah.
1129000	1130000	No, it started in it.
1130000	1131000	Oh, it started in it.
1131000	1132000	Yeah.
1132000	1133000	He's also working with the huge theater.
1133000	1135000	Someone's at the door.
1135000	1136000	Oh, shit.
1136000	1138000	The doorbell's broken.
1138000	1143000	Oh, it's the second member of the Harman Town art players, Eric Noble.
1143000	1144000	Okay.
1144000	1145000	All right.
1145000	1150000	Let's thank Tony and have him limp down to the front row with his plantar fasciitis.
1150000	1152000	Thank you, Tony.
1152000	1153000	Yeah.
1153000	1154000	That ain't shit.
1154000	1155000	Sorry, Dan.
1155000	1156000	That was a controlling moment.
1156000	1157000	Check that.
1157000	1158000	Check that.
1158000	1161000	I got a pump on it, too.
1161000	1163000	Oh, that's cool.
1163000	1164000	Sorry.
1164000	1165000	I can't hear that.
1166000	1179000	Tony, what do you want more than anything in the world?
1179000	1180000	I don't know.
1180000	1182000	Just name something you like.
1182000	1185000	The newest season of Doctor Who sooner.
1185000	1186000	Okay.
1186000	1187000	All right.
1187000	1188000	Perfect.
1188000	1192000	Tony would like the newest season of Doctor Who to come sooner, and he has plantar fasciitis,
1193000	1194000	plantar fasciitis.
1194000	1198000	It erodes the tendon on his foot and makes him walk silly.
1200000	1202000	I guess I'll be playing him.
1202000	1204000	Probably a good idea, yeah.
1205000	1206000	Okay.
1207000	1209000	This is a Hallmark movie.
1209000	1210000	Okay.
1210000	1213000	It's a movie of the week and of the heart.
1214000	1215000	Got it.
1216000	1217000	No, no.
1217000	1218000	See, that's...
1218000	1219000	Okay.
1221000	1223000	One foot to walk on.
1227000	1229000	Mom, I'm home.
1229000	1231000	Tony, is that you?
1233000	1234000	Yeah, Mom.
1234000	1241000	I'm here in the kitchen mixing chocolate and icing in a bowl like you like it.
1242000	1243000	Mom.
1244000	1248000	Tony, you're walking like a fucking idiot.
1250000	1253000	You're holding your titty in your hand, Mom.
1253000	1255000	That's my bowl of frosting.
1255000	1257000	Oh, so to speak.
1257000	1258000	Put your titties in it.
1259000	1261000	Well, I told you, it's like you like it.
1263000	1265000	Thanks, Mom.
1265000	1269000	That's why I've stayed here 25 years.
1270000	1272000	I brought somebody home with me.
1272000	1279000	He's a fellow member of the Doctor Who Society at school.
1280000	1281000	Keith.
1281000	1284000	I mean, hello, stranger.
1284000	1285000	Yes.
1285000	1288000	I've never been here before to your home.
1289000	1293000	Is that a titty in a bowl of somebody?
1293000	1295000	Yes, that must be...
1295000	1297000	I wouldn't know it if I saw it.
1298000	1299000	Okay.
1300000	1301000	Mom.
1303000	1309000	Mom, just be cool while my new friend is here.
1310000	1312000	Because I'm really gimpy.
1313000	1315000	And I got a big beard.
1315000	1317000	Tony, really, I'm on the clock here.
1317000	1318000	Oh, yeah.
1318000	1321000	I don't really have gimps, you know, terribly often, right?
1321000	1323000	Well, you two probably want your privacy.
1323000	1325000	I'll go in the living room and watch...
1325000	1326000	I don't know.
1326000	1327000	Why don't you...
1327000	1329000	Why don't you stay?
1331000	1333000	I'll leave.
1334000	1335000	Thank you.
1338000	1340000	Jesus Christ, hurry it up, Tony.
1340000	1341000	Seriously.
1341000	1343000	It's a thing.
1343000	1346000	Are you going to try to go up all those stairs right now?
1346000	1348000	Is that what you're going to do?
1348000	1349000	Again.
1350000	1352000	Why don't you...
1357000	1360000	Why is there a rap beat going up the stairs?
1361000	1365000	There's like 21 stairs, Tony.
1366000	1367000	I got it.
1368000	1369000	Just remember you...
1369000	1371000	Throw in my homemade TARDIS.
1372000	1375000	You have to come back down those stairs.
1376000	1378000	I'm upstairs now.
1379000	1381000	This is a podcast.
1381000	1384000	The next day at the hospital.
1389000	1393000	I don't understand the soundtrack at all.
1395000	1396000	Mr...
1396000	1397000	Mr...
1397000	1398000	Mr...
1398000	1399000	Mr...
1399000	1400000	Mr...
1400000	1401000	Mr...
1401000	1402000	Tony.
1402000	1403000	Tony Scott?
1403000	1404000	Tony Scott, yes.
1405000	1406000	Too soon?
1407000	1410000	I tried to kill myself and...
1413000	1417000	It's two soundtrack songs.
1417000	1420000	It's a binary movie.
1420000	1422000	Can I make you a drink?
1424000	1426000	Mr. Scott, I'm afraid you have...
1427000	1429000	Planter's fasciitis.
1431000	1435000	It means you'll never be able to walk normally again.
1436000	1437000	No.
1440000	1444000	At least I'll get to watch the next season of Doctor Who here.
1444000	1447000	Tony, there's something I have to tell you.
1447000	1451000	Watching Doctor Who is what has eaten away at the tendon on your foot.
1454000	1455000	You see,
1456000	1458000	British sci-fi programming
1459000	1464000	stimulates a part of the brain that sends a signal to the athletic portions of the body,
1465000	1467000	causing them to wither.
1473000	1475000	You told my mother?
1476000	1478000	Yeah, I mentioned it.
1478000	1480000	Do you have a mother?
1480000	1482000	Have I met her?
1484000	1486000	Everyone met my mother.
1487000	1489000	Yeah, I'm sure I told her.
1489000	1491000	If I met her, I can't remember.
1491000	1493000	Just cut it off.
1494000	1496000	I'll never dance again.
1497000	1499000	I'm going to do it with a lightsaber.
1501000	1503000	Because if I did it with a sonic screwdriver,
1503000	1506000	your other foot would start to rot away.
1506000	1510000	Maybe if you put it in a teleport machine
1510000	1512000	with a good leg,
1513000	1515000	I don't know, it was a fly reference.
1515000	1517000	No one's seen that movie in years.
1517000	1519000	Well, let's try it.
1520000	1523000	Oh, that puked on it.
1523000	1525000	That was the fly.
1525000	1527000	There we go.
1528000	1530000	I'm sorry, the Germans are coming.
1530000	1532000	The Tony story, everybody.
1532000	1534000	The Tony story.
1534000	1535000	Thank God.
1535000	1536000	One foot to...
1536000	1538000	Yeah, good job.
1539000	1540000	All right.
1542000	1546000	Freestyle, Minneapolis style.
1547000	1549000	Do the...
1551000	1553000	Oh, shit. Yeah.
1553000	1554000	What?
1554000	1556000	Peace... Peace... Peace be with style.
1556000	1557000	What? What?
1557000	1562000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
1562000	1564000	Sean McKenna limping up here.
1564000	1567000	He's going to limp around and have another beer.
1567000	1569000	He's Sean McKenna from back in Milwaukee.
1569000	1571000	Yo, he fucked his mama so hard,
1571000	1572000	then he rolled her in some dough
1572000	1575000	and put her in the tummy like the Pillsbury boy.
1575000	1578000	He fucked his mama so hard, his dick felt like a toy.
1578000	1581000	Sean McKenna, the antenna,
1581000	1584000	receiving everything that I'm going to give him.
1584000	1587000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
1589000	1592000	Yo, rhymes on fresh, your rhymes on fly,
1592000	1596000	I'm investigating a booty like Magna P.I.
1596000	1598000	I'm fucking mama.
1600000	1604000	On the ice, going to give us some Minnesota nice.
1605000	1607000	That was a pandering ice.
1607000	1608000	That was a pandering ice.
1608000	1610000	Pandering, pandering, pandering.
1610000	1612000	A minute of Minnesota.
1612000	1616000	Minnesota got no iota that it's a town like Yoda
1616000	1618000	knows everything, Yoda.
1618000	1621000	I'm going to fuck your mama like a green man.
1621000	1623000	Fuck her in a Pringles can,
1623000	1626000	put my dick inside it, make it fresh and smooth.
1626000	1629000	Fucked your mama so hard, she couldn't move.
1629000	1630000	Yo, yo, mama.
1630000	1632000	I fucked her, she was getting lippy.
1632000	1635000	I fucked her up on the Mississippi.
1635000	1636000	I fucked her on the ice.
1636000	1638000	It was nice.
1638000	1639000	I fucked her twice.
1639000	1641000	I fucked her thrice.
1641000	1643000	I fucked your mama four times and more.
1643000	1646000	She lost the times table so she couldn't multiply no more.
1646000	1648000	But then she made a little baby for me,
1648000	1650000	and it came out and I said,
1650000	1652000	its face looks like pee.
1652000	1655000	Yo, I fucked your mama doggy style.
1655000	1658000	I fucked your mama like your pile.
1658000	1661000	She's damn, that pussy's good.
1661000	1664000	I knew I fucking would.
1664000	1665000	There you go, mister.
1665000	1666000	Surprise, surprise.
1666000	1669000	I fucked your mama in her mouth and came between her eyes.
1669000	1670000	I fucked your mama north.
1670000	1671000	I fucked your mama south.
1671000	1675000	I fucked your mama in her ear and her mouth.
1675000	1676000	Yeah.
1676000	1679000	Hammering, hammering, hammering.
1679000	1682000	Dan Harmon, ladies and gentlemen.
1682000	1684000	Sean McKenna.
1684000	1686000	Sorry about your ankle.
1686000	1687000	Eric Noble.
1687000	1690000	Before we say goodbye to Sean very quickly,
1690000	1692000	maybe we can do a speed version of this.
1692000	1694000	Once upon a time.
1694000	1699000	Who's familiar with Who's on First by Abbott and Costello?
1699000	1705000	Well, these guys used to do a little variation on Who's on First.
1705000	1710000	They would do Who's on First with Abbott and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1710000	1713000	It was a very cutting-edge comedic bit
1713000	1717000	that we were doing as early as 94, 95.
1717000	1720000	Yeah, sure.
1720000	1722000	Who's going to be Abbott and who's going to be Arnold?
1722000	1724000	I don't know.
1724000	1726000	Which one was Abbott?
1726000	1729000	I'd like to see Sean McKenna as Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1729000	1730000	I would like to.
1730000	1732000	Let's do Arnold and Arnold.
1732000	1733000	All right.
1733000	1734000	Okay.
1734000	1736000	We'll do Arnold and Arnold.
1736000	1737000	Arnold and Arnold.
1737000	1738000	Do I need a mic stand?
1738000	1739000	Yeah, probably.
1739000	1740000	Yeah.
1740000	1742000	They really, you know.
1742000	1744000	Yeah, you need full focus on this mentally.
1744000	1746000	Well, I just need something to lean on.
1746000	1747000	All right.
1747000	1759000	And now presenting the Hormontown players, Arnold and Arnold.
1759000	1760000	Arnold.
1760000	1761000	Yeah.
1761000	1766000	Listen, I got a baseball team.
1766000	1767000	It's very nice.
1767000	1768000	All right.
1768000	1771000	I got to learn the name of the players.
1771000	1773000	I have the list right here.
1773000	1774000	Okay.
1774000	1775000	Then tell them to me.
1775000	1776000	Who's on first?
1776000	1777000	Okay.
1777000	1779000	I don't understand what you're saying.
1779000	1780000	Who's on first?
1780000	1783000	Why would someone name who be on first?
1783000	1784000	Who is on first?
1784000	1785000	Okay.
1785000	1788000	Well, that's a dumb name.
1788000	1790000	I don't know.
1790000	1792000	Who's on second?
1792000	1799000	I don't know either.
1800000	1801000	Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
1801000	1802000	Thank you.
1802000	1803000	Arnold and Arnold.
1803000	1804000	Thank you.
1804000	1806000	Let's hear it for Sean McKenna and Eric Noble.
1806000	1807000	Wow.
1807000	1811000	From humble beginnings, Arnold and Arnold.
1811000	1815000	I feel like Eric Noble got the short end of tonight's stick.
1815000	1819000	It kind of came up and, yeah, we didn't really.
1819000	1821000	Someone should really control this show.
1821000	1822000	Yeah.
1822000	1824000	We didn't really use him.
1824000	1827000	He's very talented, very funny, very handsome.
1827000	1829000	Very handsome, too.
1829000	1830000	Yeah.
1830000	1831000	He's a brother, too.
1831000	1834000	Very handsome.
1834000	1839000	Spencer, I'm being attacked by...
1839000	1840000	Arnold Monster.
1840000	1841000	What's that?
1841000	1842000	Arnold Monster.
1842000	1844000	I'm being attacked by an Arnold Monster.
1844000	1845000	Okay.
1845000	1846000	Someone yelled out.
1846000	1848000	Someone approaches you.
1848000	1851000	He's about a four foot seven or so.
1851000	1854000	He pushes small children out of his way and says,
1854000	1856000	Get to the top of...
1856000	1857000	That's all.
1857000	1858000	All right.
1858000	1859000	All right.
1859000	1862000	You want to hit that Spencer theme when we do that?
1862000	1863000	Sorry.
1863000	1864000	It's her first night controlling.
1864000	1867000	I'm having iPad troubles.
1867000	1868000	Yeah.
1868000	1871000	I'm not so good at the references, if you'll recall.
1871000	1872000	Oh, there it is.
1872000	1873000	Okay.
1873000	1874000	Yeah, no, yeah.
1874000	1875000	We don't like to do the Hollywood stuff with Spencer.
1875000	1876000	Oh, he's slowly.
1876000	1877000	Sorry.
1877000	1878000	He's forced to have it.
1878000	1880000	Spencer grew up in a basement that he still lives in.
1880000	1881000	There's no TV in there.
1881000	1884000	There's just Dungeons and Dragons books.
1884000	1887000	And unlike, he's a genius.
1887000	1891000	Spencer, I'm being attacked by...
1891000	1893000	Shit.
1893000	1896000	Lack of sound engineering skills.
1896000	1899000	Walking into a non-acoustically tuned space,
1899000	1904000	you suddenly realize that the variables aren't exactly lining up right.
1904000	1909000	You clap your hands and hear your hands clapping.
1910000	1913000	It's a strange sensation.
1919000	1921000	I'm not worthy.
1921000	1930000	Spencer, I'm being attacked by a...
1930000	1931000	Hot dish.
1931000	1932000	Oh, sorry, what?
1932000	1933000	Hot dish.
1933000	1934000	A hot dish?
1934000	1937000	I'm being attacked by a hot dish.
1937000	1940000	Is that a colloquialism?
1940000	1941000	Casserole.
1941000	1942000	Oh, I'm being...
1942000	1943000	It's a casserole.
1943000	1946000	I'm being attacked by a hot casserole dish.
1946000	1951000	Unfirling the noodles widely with an array of various meat sauces.
1951000	1955000	You see the Rakatis G's dripping off the noodles.
1955000	1957000	Dinner is served.
1957000	1967000	One guy initiated a standing O for that.
1967000	1968000	And he wasn't...
1968000	1970000	He's not a fat guy.
1970000	1973000	He wasn't applauding the casserole.
1973000	1976000	He was applauding Spencer's GM skills.
1976000	1977000	All right.
1977000	1979000	So, all right.
1979000	1981000	Is there anybody in the audience...
1981000	1983000	I'm gonna go out and work the crowd.
1983000	1984000	Cool.
1984000	1986000	You got some crowd working music?
1986000	2003000	In the meanwhile, I'm gonna play polar bear on ice.
2003000	2007000	I don't understand.
2007000	2009000	I'd like to work the back of the crowd,
2009000	2011000	because these people come and they don't have to...
2011000	2014000	Oh, is this what I sound like back here?
2014000	2015000	That was weird.
2015000	2017000	It's like those Discovery World exhibits
2017000	2019000	where you talk on the phone,
2019000	2022000	and you can hear yourself in the ear, but on a delay.
2022000	2026000	I can barely pull it together back here.
2026000	2030000	My lips move, and then a second later, I hear my lips move.
2030000	2033000	It probably sounds less exciting on the podcast.
2033000	2036000	It probably sounds less exciting for everybody.
2036000	2038000	This is just for me right now.
2038000	2042000	Abracadabra...
2042000	2043000	Three hours later...
2043000	2047000	Wow, syllabus, red leather, yellow leather.
2047000	2049000	What's your name?
2049000	2050000	Sam.
2050000	2053000	No, it's not.
2053000	2056000	Crowd working.
2056000	2059000	Sam, did your parents hit you?
2059000	2061000	I don't remember.
2061000	2064000	Well, then yes.
2065000	2068000	With implements, my dad hit me with a belt.
2068000	2070000	Your mother hit you with implants?
2070000	2072000	No.
2072000	2075000	He said, your mother hit you with implants?
2075000	2077000	No, I said, did they hit you with implements?
2077000	2080000	My dad, for instance, hit me with a belt.
2080000	2086000	Did your parents hit you with anything, like a wooden spoon?
2086000	2090000	No, I think before I had any memories I was spanked,
2090000	2092000	but like I said, it must have hit me pretty hard.
2093000	2096000	Hey, Dan.
2096000	2100000	I have a bunch of animal sound effects up here
2100000	2103000	that are pretty obscure.
2103000	2106000	I'm going to play an animal sound effect.
2106000	2109000	You pick a partner out there
2109000	2112000	and you guys can try to guess what the animal sound effect is.
2112000	2114000	As an experiment.
2114000	2118000	Okay, I like Sam.
2118000	2119000	Are we competing?
2119000	2121000	Am I competing with Sam?
2122000	2125000	Let's see.
2125000	2127000	A gentleman with the checker.
2127000	2128000	Yes, yes.
2128000	2129000	You holding your shirt.
2129000	2130000	What's your name?
2130000	2131000	Max.
2131000	2132000	Max?
2132000	2133000	Two teams.
2133000	2134000	Max?
2134000	2137000	Oh, it's Matt, like the actual name.
2137000	2139000	Okay, got it.
2139000	2140000	Because Matt isn't a name.
2140000	2142000	Would you run up and join Spencer?
2142000	2145000	Would you be Spencer's partner?
2145000	2150000	Welcome to Guess the Sound Effect.
2150000	2154000	I'm so sorry that your dad hit you.
2154000	2156000	But he didn't really.
2156000	2158000	He didn't really?
2158000	2160000	I think they just probably smacked him in the butt
2160000	2163000	when he touched a stove or something.
2163000	2164000	That's the impression I'm getting.
2164000	2166000	I was talking about your dad.
2166000	2167000	Oh, my dad, yeah.
2167000	2168000	He knocked me around bad.
2168000	2171000	Okay.
2171000	2173000	I was going to say, if your dad didn't hit you,
2173000	2176000	why am I turned on by you all the time?
2176000	2177000	All right, here we go.
2177000	2179000	Animal sound effects.
2179000	2182000	And just to give you an example,
2182000	2187000	this animal sound effect is called dingo fight.
2187000	2190000	Dingos.
2190000	2191000	Fighters.
2191000	2194000	Wait, where is that?
2194000	2197000	Uh-oh.
2197000	2199000	Oh, there it is.
2199000	2201000	Dingos.
2201000	2203000	Anyway, that's dingo fight.
2203000	2204000	Okay.
2204000	2205000	All right, okay.
2205000	2206000	Here we go.
2206000	2208000	I'm going to play a sound effect,
2208000	2212000	and the team to get closest to it, the quickest,
2212000	2213000	Quinn's.
2213000	2215000	Don't know why I said it like that.
2215000	2217000	It's fancy.
2217000	2218000	Quinn's.
2218000	2220000	I just made it like I was a Jewish man in a deli
2220000	2221000	for no reason.
2221000	2224000	All right, here we go.
2224000	2229000	Cheetos?
2229000	2231000	Name an animal.
2231000	2232000	The teapot bird.
2232000	2233000	Sorry?
2233000	2235000	Sam said the teapot bird.
2235000	2236000	The teapot bird?
2236000	2240000	Swarming June bugs.
2240000	2241000	That's pretty close.
2241000	2244000	It was fly, swarm in Roebuck Bay, Australia.
2244000	2245000	Very good.
2245000	2249000	One point to audience dwellers.
2249000	2254000	Okay, let's play to two.
2254000	2255000	All right, here we go.
2255000	2262000	Question number two.
2262000	2265000	That's a horse.
2265000	2268000	A capybara.
2268000	2269000	Donkey.
2269000	2275000	That is a brain donkey in Brazil with parrots.
2275000	2277000	All right, this is the tiebreaker.
2277000	2280000	Here it comes.
2280000	2283000	All right, Jeff, I know that you're listening
2283000	2285000	to this podcast.
2285000	2289000	We may edit this part out.
2289000	2292000	As a rule, I edit all the stuff out that the audience
2292000	2301000	is able to do in their car on the way here.
2301000	2302000	Jeff, I'll do better.
2302000	2304000	It's going to get better.
2304000	2306000	All right, here we go.
2306000	2309000	Howler monkey.
2309000	2311000	Nope.
2311000	2313000	Non-Howler monkey.
2313000	2314000	Some kind of bird.
2314000	2317000	Reese's macaque.
2317000	2318000	I know what that is.
2318000	2320000	That's one of those little fuckers.
2320000	2323000	A fox.
2323000	2325000	Dingo's fighting again.
2325000	2326000	A double weasel.
2326000	2328000	You guys were close with Gibbon.
2328000	2332000	Gibbon goes to the stage team and they were the winner.
2332000	2335000	It's okay.
2335000	2337000	All right, let's have a hand for Sam back here.
2337000	2339000	And you win not having to talk to me about this bit
2339000	2341000	after the show.
2341000	2343000	Everyone's free to fail here at Harmatown.
2343000	2348000	You're not supposed to come up with a game show on the fly.
2348000	2351000	That's not your responsibility, baby.
2351000	2353000	Baby, I love you.
2353000	2356000	I love you too.
2356000	2358000	Someone booed love.
2358000	2360000	I heard one guy booed love.
2360000	2361000	Who was it?
2361000	2364000	All right, what's your name?
2364000	2366000	Bring him up to the stage.
2366000	2367000	Josh booed love.
2367000	2369000	Come on up, Josh.
2370000	2372000	I may be bad with sound effects,
2372000	2374000	but I can fucking talk love all day.
2374000	2375000	Let's do it.
2375000	2380000	Let's play a segment called Who Hurt You?
2380000	2381000	Who's Dan Herman?
2381000	2383000	Let's also play a segment called
2383000	2387000	None of Your Friends Would Hold Your T-shirt.
2387000	2389000	I'm sorry I bought one.
2389000	2391000	No, no, it's okay.
2391000	2392000	I'm sorry, Josh?
2392000	2393000	Yes, that's right.
2393000	2394000	Yes, okay.
2394000	2395000	All right, Josh.
2395000	2396000	Jeff writes down everybody's name on a screen.
2396000	2398000	Who hurt you, Josh?
2399000	2400000	I don't think anybody did.
2400000	2401000	Really?
2401000	2402000	Yeah.
2402000	2405000	Well, why boo love?
2405000	2407000	Why not?
2407000	2410000	Are you booing our love specifically
2410000	2411000	or just love in general?
2411000	2412000	No, I don't know.
2412000	2415000	Your love kind of destroyed an episode, kind of.
2415000	2418000	A few nights ago.
2420000	2423000	I love you guys, seriously.
2423000	2426000	Were you bummed out that there was one less free episode
2426000	2428000	that was funny?
2428000	2430000	You're happy to be.
2430000	2432000	It was just awkward.
2432000	2433000	I agree.
2433000	2436000	Well, is it more or less awkward
2436000	2438000	than not communicating with people?
2438000	2440000	If we're five questions deep into a conversation
2440000	2443000	and every answer is I don't know or nothing
2443000	2447000	or a snarky comeback, is that graceful
2447000	2451000	or is that you don't know, do you?
2451000	2453000	What's your point?
2453000	2455000	I come from the mind space
2455000	2457000	that it's better to go with the flow
2457000	2459000	and say what's on your mind.
2459000	2461000	You can't tell me there's not one person
2461000	2464000	in the history of your life that hurt you.
2466000	2467000	Maybe.
2467000	2472000	I feel like Josh might have a bigger issue with me.
2472000	2473000	Oh, not at all.
2473000	2474000	I think no.
2474000	2475000	Oh, really?
2475000	2477000	I think you're projecting.
2479000	2480000	No, come on.
2480000	2481000	How many?
2481000	2483000	I mean, I'm not even going to assume.
2484000	2486000	You've had relationships, right?
2486000	2487000	Yeah.
2488000	2491000	Was there one that ended that you didn't want to end?
2491000	2493000	I suppose that's probably true.
2493000	2494000	Yeah.
2494000	2497000	And when you did your podcast tour across the country,
2501000	2504000	when there were stresses that arose,
2504000	2506000	how did you deal with that?
2506000	2508000	I love your podcast.
2508000	2510000	The best cast?
2510000	2511000	I love it.
2511000	2512000	Great.
2512000	2514000	This is going down a bad road.
2514000	2516000	This is not a harm in town.
2516000	2519000	This is not a road to harm in town.
2519000	2520000	I'm celebrating as fast.
2520000	2522000	He booed Love.
2522000	2523000	We brought him up.
2523000	2526000	We're not going down his wardrobe.
2526000	2529000	We want to get to know him, talk to him,
2529000	2532000	try to break through to something human.
2533000	2535000	I don't want to hug him.
2535000	2538000	No, I think this is a nice thing to talk about.
2538000	2542000	Josh, why do you feel our love ruined the podcast?
2544000	2547000	The podcast was going, and it was a lot of fun,
2547000	2551000	and then it just kind of hit this weird train wreck,
2551000	2554000	and I don't know.
2554000	2555000	It's okay, guys.
2555000	2556000	It's true.
2556000	2557000	It's true.
2557000	2559000	I'm just saying how I feel, man.
2559000	2560000	Yeah.
2560000	2561000	I was kind of into it.
2561000	2563000	I liked it, but I guess it was about me.
2564000	2566000	I guess it was about someone else's relationship.
2567000	2569000	I'd be like, I don't know.
2569000	2572000	I can't really listen to it through anyone else's ears, though.
2572000	2573000	I didn't know.
2573000	2576000	It was probably like a half hour longer than it needed to be,
2576000	2579000	in terms of talking about relationships.
2579000	2581000	To be honest, I listened to the entire thing.
2581000	2583000	It's not like I turned it off or anything.
2583000	2585000	You were riveted.
2588000	2594000	Well, I'm sorry for making the podcast not funny.
2595000	2596000	Josh is mad at me, Dan.
2596000	2597000	I'm telling you.
2597000	2598000	He's mad at you?
2598000	2599000	Yes, he is.
2599000	2600000	It's okay.
2600000	2604000	I mean, I'm the girlfriend who came on stage and was in a tizzy.
2604000	2606000	And as I explained in the Chicago podcast,
2606000	2609000	I was upset about a previous fight and things.
2609000	2612000	Can I walk you guys through an alternate scenario?
2612000	2616000	Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
2617000	2619000	Dan's in the crowd talking to people.
2619000	2621000	Something happens about love.
2621000	2623000	A bunch of people start cheering,
2623000	2626000	feeling the need to break the mold.
2626000	2629000	He boos whatever reaction is being cheered.
2629000	2630000	Right.
2630000	2634000	Called out by Dan, he acquiesce coming up on stage,
2634000	2637000	proceeds to fail to answer the questions you want him to ask.
2637000	2639000	And when he comes to a question he can ask,
2639000	2642000	he answers in a way he hopes will be entertaining,
2642000	2644000	and is then torn apart for it.
2650000	2652000	The real star of the show, of course,
2652000	2653000	is Spencer.
2653000	2655000	I think we're all just raw and vulnerable up here,
2655000	2656000	you guys, it's fine.
2656000	2657000	Yeah.
2657000	2659000	Well, I know, and this isn't a day,
2659000	2661000	but I know that everything that you say up here,
2661000	2663000	Josh, as you're speaking honestly about your feelings,
2663000	2665000	you're going to make sure that it's hilarious.
2667000	2669000	I like it when people laugh, yeah.
2671000	2672000	I'm just kidding.
2672000	2677000	I'm sorry for that, but podcasts not being very funny.
2677000	2679000	You already said that.
2680000	2683000	Where's my gong?
2683000	2685000	In order for Josh to be mad at you,
2685000	2688000	I think Josh would have to be in love with me.
2688000	2690000	He's mad at our relationship.
2690000	2692000	He doesn't think that it makes for entertaining.
2692000	2696000	He was like, well, we were having fun in the Pittsburgh show,
2696000	2698000	and then all of a sudden we were talking about things
2698000	2701000	that are kind of common probably,
2701000	2703000	like the sound of a man and a woman,
2703000	2706000	like going back and forth about who hurt who more
2706000	2708000	and who needs to change and who doesn't need to change.
2709000	2711000	For some people it might be riveting,
2711000	2715000	and for other people inaccessible.
2715000	2716000	Virgins.
2717000	2719000	That was a dumb, obvious, easy joke.
2719000	2720000	It's stupid.
2723000	2726000	I think Spencer's theory is the most accurate.
2726000	2732000	I think Josh is dressed perfectly.
2732000	2734000	We're all good human beings.
2734000	2735000	Aaron's doing a great job.
2735000	2737000	I thought the Pittsburgh show was excellent.
2738000	2740000	Unpredictable turns and all.
2741000	2743000	I do want to say to Josh,
2743000	2745000	and I said this in the Chicago show,
2745000	2748000	but if there was any worry that Dan was going to censor himself
2748000	2752000	because I talked about something that bummed me out,
2752000	2753000	he definitely isn't.
2753000	2756000	That's an understandable fear, and I'm sorry about that.
2757000	2758000	That's all.
2761000	2762000	Adventure.
2764000	2766000	All right, Josh, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time.
2766000	2769000	Also, Matt, ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
2769000	2770000	Poor Matt.
2770000	2772000	Oh, Matt, I'm so sorry.
2772000	2774000	Matt, come up here for a second.
2778000	2780000	For you guys listening in the audience,
2780000	2784000	in podcast land, Matt is the name of the guy
2784000	2790000	that was on Spencer's team during a sound effect game show
2790000	2795000	that may or may not be in the edited show you're listening to.
2796000	2798000	He was put on a team with Spencer
2798000	2802000	and has been standing behind me next to Spencer
2802000	2804000	just kind of hanging out.
2805000	2807000	The attested donkey, yeah.
2808000	2809000	Great seat, though.
2809000	2810000	Yeah.
2810000	2811000	He horrendously great seat.
2811000	2814000	But it's hard to tell if we edit out Josh or the audio game show
2814000	2818000	or the, you know, we don't know what will be frog DNA
2818000	2820000	and what will be dinosaur DNA.
2821000	2822000	We're after the show.
2822000	2824000	Well, it just seemed like no one was controlling.
2824000	2825000	Right, right.
2825000	2826000	Or there was no show.
2826000	2829000	Ladies and gentlemen, good night.
2831000	2832000	Dong.
2833000	2836000	Matt, I think you've paid your dues.
2836000	2840000	Let's get to know you and touch your heart.
2840000	2841000	Please do.
2841000	2843000	Are you from Minneapolis?
2843000	2844000	I'm from Minneapolis.
2844000	2845000	What do you do here?
2845000	2846000	I'm a writer.
2846000	2847000	You're a writer?
2847000	2848000	Oh, wow.
2848000	2849000	What kind of writer?
2849000	2850000	Corporate writer.
2850000	2851000	What is that?
2851000	2852000	Now, get specific.
2852000	2853000	What does that entail?
2853000	2855000	Corporate writer, advertising, that kind of thing.
2855000	2857000	Like a gun for hire or you work for a company?
2857000	2858000	I work for a company.
2858000	2859000	Can you say which one?
2859000	2860000	I can't, unfortunately.
2860000	2861000	Microsoft?
2861000	2864000	Yeah, there we go.
2864000	2866000	My fiancé just said CIA, so.
2866000	2867000	What?
2867000	2868000	No, not really.
2868000	2869000	Shut up.
2869000	2870000	Yeah, no.
2874000	2877000	If someone says they can't say who they work for and then they go,
2877000	2880000	CIA, it could be true.
2880000	2881000	I don't know.
2884000	2885000	Hate to be so secretive.
2885000	2886000	No, you just don't want to.
2886000	2888000	It's McDonald's or something and you don't want to be on a podcast saying.
2888000	2889000	I want to still be employed.
2889000	2890000	Yeah, exactly.
2890000	2891000	Yeah.
2891000	2892000	Yeah, we did a show in Chicago and I was kind of like,
2892000	2895000	oh, I just started talking about the people I'm working for.
2895000	2898000	And that hasn't podcast yet, but I cringe a little bit when I hear it.
2898000	2900000	It's awesome, though, so it has to go out there.
2900000	2904000	But unlike you, I make my living getting fired.
2904000	2910000	Like that is my livelihood in a roundabout way.
2911000	2917000	I'm like a weird kind of like a frog with an ass for a head that jumps.
2920000	2921000	Wow.
2921000	2923000	The sound of a frog.
2926000	2927000	All right, Matt.
2927000	2930000	Matt, what's your favorite, favorite movie?
2930000	2932000	You know, I mean, a favorite movie.
2932000	2934000	I hate it when people ask that, too.
2934000	2935000	Okay.
2935000	2938000	A favorite movie, A Serious Man.
2938000	2939000	A Serious Man.
2939000	2940000	That is a great movie.
2940000	2941000	Yeah.
2941000	2942000	That's a really underrated, wonderful movie.
2942000	2943000	I've only seen it once.
2943000	2944000	I like that movie.
2944000	2945000	Which red owl played a part in?
2945000	2946000	You.
2946000	2947000	Red owl.
2947000	2948000	Whoa.
2948000	2949000	All right.
2949000	2950000	Now we got to know.
2950000	2951000	Okay.
2951000	2955000	Who said fuck you really angrily to what?
2955000	2958000	A silly man said, fuck you.
2958000	2961000	I mean, please come up.
2961000	2967000	Like, I mean, I'm going to make this assumption about a Hermitown audience,
2967000	2970000	even though on paper someone yelling out fuck you.
2970000	2973000	Come over here, sir.
2973000	2975000	Shouldn't be rewarded in maybe a regular show,
2975000	2978000	but usually people here have something on their mind.
2978000	2979000	What's your name?
2979000	2980000	My name's Joe.
2980000	2981000	Hi, Joe.
2981000	2982000	How are you doing?
2982000	2983000	I'm doing okay.
2983000	2985000	Joe, explain the reaction.
2985000	2988000	Thank you for welcoming me to Hermitown.
2988000	2989000	Oh, no problem.
2991000	2993000	Comptrolling disaster.
2995000	2996000	Spencer Neri has this.
2996000	2997000	All right, we got it.
2997000	2998000	Okay.
2998000	2999000	Me versus the microphone.
2999000	3002000	They just fixed the microphone for the podcast listeners.
3002000	3003000	We got it.
3003000	3005000	I feel important now.
3005000	3006000	Some up on stage.
3006000	3007000	So what are we doing?
3007000	3011000	Joe, you're going to tell people why he's yelled fuck you out.
3012000	3015000	What were you yelling fuck you in response to?
3015000	3016000	Honestly?
3016000	3017000	No, not honestly.
3017000	3018000	Lie to us.
3018000	3020000	Oh, this guy, right, guys?
3020000	3021000	Yes.
3021000	3023000	At least you're gone, honestly.
3023000	3024000	Just kidding.
3025000	3027000	It was strictly to get on stage.
3027000	3029000	So you weren't really saying fuck you?
3029000	3030000	Right.
3030000	3033000	You're kind of giving me bedroom eyes a little bit.
3035000	3037000	Okay, so this is an interesting phenomenon here.
3037000	3038000	I'm sorry, Dan.
3038000	3043000	I'm going to press pause here for a second because this is a very,
3043000	3047000	very interesting thing that's happening here for the second time in a row.
3048000	3050000	We finally hit this point.
3051000	3056000	In Harman Town, people who say things in the audience and are compelled to say
3056000	3060000	things, they get to come up on stage and we talk to them until we get to know
3060000	3061000	them.
3061000	3064000	And now we've reached this point where that's the second guy who just, like
3064000	3069000	Spencer said, someone wants to be different from the pack.
3069000	3074000	They're specifically saying things so that they can come up on stage and at
3074000	3078000	which point we're ringing a dry rag, just talking to a person.
3078000	3079000	They say, hey, what do you want?
3079000	3087000	And they're like, to be on stage, to have my name exist, to stand.
3087000	3090000	Is that totally true where you're really saying that?
3090000	3092000	I am not a dry rag.
3092000	3094000	Okay, that was dehumanizing.
3094000	3096000	I apologize.
3096000	3101000	But your motivation was not, you didn't want to come up and talk about a serious
3101000	3103000	man being his favorite movie.
3103000	3104000	Not at all.
3104000	3105000	You said fuck you.
3105000	3108000	For the same reason that Josh booed love, you said fuck you.
3108000	3111000	No, no, fuck Josh for booing love.
3111000	3113000	There, you're changing your story.
3113000	3116000	It's not all attack, Josh.
3116000	3117000	All right.
3117000	3118000	All right.
3118000	3120000	You sit down.
3120000	3121000	Thank you.
3121000	3122000	I'll go sit down.
3122000	3124000	Thank you for coming up here.
3124000	3128000	Maybe tonight and maybe in further shows, instead of yelling something like
3128000	3133000	fuck you, maybe say like, bananas in my pants or something obscure.
3133000	3134000	All right.
3134000	3135000	Bananas in my pants, guys.
3135000	3136000	Come up here.
3136000	3137000	Come up here.
3137000	3138000	All right.
3138000	3139000	All right.
3139000	3142000	Cover over this way.
3142000	3147000	I thought like a dozen people would say it like at the same time.
3147000	3148000	Okay.
3148000	3149000	All right.
3149000	3150000	All right.
3150000	3151000	That was a misfire.
3151000	3152000	Okay.
3152000	3153000	Okay.
3153000	3154000	So you're a team player.
3154000	3155000	What's your name, fella?
3155000	3156000	My name is Jaffer.
3156000	3157000	It's okay if you don't get it.
3157000	3158000	Jaffer?
3158000	3159000	No, you got it on the first try.
3159000	3160000	That's awesome.
3160000	3161000	All right.
3161000	3162000	Like an exotic gaffer.
3162000	3167000	I applied tape to things in an exotic way, an exotic brown skinned way.
3167000	3168000	Thank you.
3168000	3170000	What do you do, Jaffer?
3170000	3173000	Oh, well, I gave Spencer my card.
3173000	3177000	I'm the event coordinator for Fantasy Flight Games and I gave Spencer's.
3177000	3180000	Is that like planes that have jungles on them?
3180000	3181000	What is that?
3181000	3182000	What is Fantasy Flight?
3182000	3186000	Oh, Fantasy Flight Games is a hobby game company.
3186000	3188000	We're located in Rosewood.
3188000	3189000	It's like sales tax.
3189000	3190000	Well, no.
3190000	3191000	You are...
3191000	3192000	I mean, this is a...
3192000	3193000	Are they electronic games?
3193000	3194000	This is your crowd.
3194000	3195000	This is a...
3195000	3196000	No, no.
3196000	3197000	We're table type.
3197000	3198000	Role playing games.
3198000	3199000	Oh, really?
3199000	3200000	Oh, cool.
3200000	3201000	I love games.
3201000	3202000	Which is why...
3202000	3203000	Oh, okay.
3203000	3204000	This is so weird.
3204000	3205000	I didn't...
3205000	3207000	I really didn't expect this to happen.
3207000	3208000	He just thought...
3208000	3210000	He thought everyone would go bananas though.
3210000	3211000	All right.
3211000	3212000	That's why you're a hero.
3212000	3213000	It's fine.
3213000	3214000	All right.
3214000	3215000	He already got his plug.
3215000	3216000	His name of his story.
3216000	3217000	If you're in Minneapolis and you...
3217000	3218000	No, we're a publisher.
3218000	3219000	We publish games.
3219000	3220000	All right.
3220000	3221000	God damn it.
3221000	3222000	Japper, everybody.
3222000	3223000	Thank you, Japper.
3223000	3224000	Thank you.
3224000	3225000	Japper loves bananas in his pants.
3225000	3226000	All right.
3226000	3227000	All right.
3227000	3229000	Matt, we were talking about your favorite movie.
3229000	3230000	Yes.
3230000	3231000	Yeah.
3231000	3232000	Fuck that.
3232000	3233000	Oh, no.
3233000	3234000	All right.
3234000	3236000	Let's hear it for Matt also, ladies and gentlemen.
3236000	3237000	He loves a simple...
3237000	3240000	A simple man.
3240000	3242000	All right.
3242000	3243000	Okay.
3243000	3252000	Well, not a good idea to work the crowd.
3252000	3254000	A little bit of a mistake.
3254000	3255000	No.
3255000	3256000	Fuck you.
3256000	3257000	Fuck you.
3257000	3258000	Fuck you.
3258000	3259000	Fuck.
3259000	3262000	Absolutely fuck you.
3262000	3263000	No more.
3263000	3264000	No more.
3264000	3265000	No more Q&A.
3266000	3271000	But, you know, there's a time of every...
3271000	3277000	There's a time during every Harmon show where the end of my nose starts to tingle and my...
3277000	3280000	Oh, and then you have to go back to the powder room?
3280000	3281000	No, no.
3281000	3282000	No, no.
3282000	3291000	And my lips start to plump and I start feeling stronger and it's D&D time.
3291000	3297000	Should I pass out the characters?
3297000	3298000	Yes, please.
3298000	3299000	Dispense the character, Spencer.
3299000	3300000	Yes.
3300000	3301000	All right.
3301000	3302000	Then be entertaining.
3302000	3303000	Hey, everybody.
3303000	3306000	This really is a wonderful city and a cool space.
3306000	3307000	So, yeah.
3307000	3308000	Hey, there's a guy with a friend.
3308000	3309000	It's cool?
3309000	3310000	I don't know.
3310000	3311000	Oh, just saying hello.
3311000	3312000	Stay where you are.
3312000	3313000	Okay.
3313000	3314000	Stay where you are.
3314000	3315000	We'll talk after.
3315000	3316000	I screwed up this music.
3316000	3317000	I'm sorry.
3317000	3318000	I'll do it over again.
3318000	3319000	What's the other...
3319000	3320000	What's the other...
3320000	3321000	What's the other...
3321000	3322000	What's the other...
3322000	3323000	The Twin Cities is the St. Paul, yeah.
3323000	3324000	You guys all know Garrison Keeler?
3324000	3325000	No.
3325000	3326000	Is that a hat?
3326000	3327000	No.
3327000	3328000	So, you hate Garrison Keeler?
3328000	3329000	Yes.
3329000	3330000	Fuck that guy.
3330000	3331000	Whoa.
3331000	3332000	Whoa.
3332000	3333000	Whoa.
3333000	3334000	Whoa.
3334000	3335000	Whoa.
3335000	3336000	Whoa.
3336000	3337000	Whoa.
3337000	3338000	Whoa.
3338000	3339000	Whoa.
3339000	3340000	Whoa.
3340000	3341000	Whoa.
3341000	3342000	Whoa.
3342000	3343000	Whoa.
3343000	3344000	Whoa.
3344000	3347320	Who hates Garrison Keeler?
3347320	3348320	You.
3348320	3350380	Why, why do you...
3350380	3351380	What's your name?
3351380	3352380	He talks too slow.
3352380	3353380	He talks too slow?
3353380	3357240	Is that your only reason for disliking him?
3357240	3361000	Does anyone have a better reason for disliking Garrison Keeler?
3361000	3362000	Yes.
3362000	3363000	Right.
3363000	3364000	Oh.
3364000	3365000	What?
3365000	3366000	That's not funny.
3366000	3367000	It's just Minnesota.
3367000	3368000	Right.
3368000	3369000	Okay.
3369000	3373960	Yeah, that is a little annoying.
3373960	3374960	She said he sings.
3374960	3375960	That's true.
3375960	3376960	Like, he puts himself on everything.
3376960	3377960	Yeah, it is.
3377960	3378960	It's his fucking show.
3378960	3379960	Yeah, it is.
3379960	3380960	It's his show.
3380960	3386640	It says Arthur Keeler in the background.
3386640	3396480	If you've just joined us, Aaron asks, do you guys like Garrison Keeler to 225-year-olds?
3397480	3400480	Who shockingly replied no.
3400480	3402480	There was a mixed reaction.
3402480	3411480	The answer to the question, why not, is he's 109 years old, his show is 70 hours long,
3411480	3421480	he sings and talks about being in a city, he's the Dan Harmon of the future.
3421480	3423480	But then everyone started yelling at each other.
3423480	3427480	And then one guy, I'm relaying this to the podcast people because no one can hear people
3427480	3428480	in the audience.
3428480	3433480	Then another guy said, it's his fucking show about Garrison Keeler.
3433480	3437480	You're kind of a punk rock guy sticking up for Garrison Keeler.
3437480	3440480	And then people are going back and forth.
3440480	3444480	And now you're all caught up if you're listening to this in podcast form.
3444480	3446480	I like that guy.
3446480	3449480	He likes rhubarb pie and powder milk biscuits.
3449480	3455480	Rhubarb pie.
3455480	3460480	Dan, can you do a monologue as Garrison Keeler about your day?
3460480	3468480	About, I'd like to do it about rhubarb pie.
3468480	3471480	Jimmy, your dog pomero, Jimmy, start right now.
3471480	3484480	I woke up this morning in Lake Wobegon with tremendous erection.
3484480	3490480	You're Bane from Batman.
3490480	3491480	Just go with it.
3491480	3495480	Be Bane as Garrison Keeler as you.
3495480	3505480	My cock, Batman, is stronger than your body.
3505480	3506480	All right, very good.
3506480	3509480	Let's do some D&D.
3509480	3522480	The weather in Lake Wobegon, Gotham, Lake Gotham, the people will no longer stand for
3522480	3528480	rhubarb pie.
3528480	3539480	Margaret made her famous fruitcake and brought it over to the Jacobson's house for what
3539480	3548480	promised to be a perfectly ordinary Thanksgiving.
3548480	3551480	The embers were warm.
3551480	3556480	The crime was rampant.
3556480	3564480	And the justice was ultimately mine.
3564480	3565480	All right.
3565480	3567480	Batman.
3567480	3569480	Bane Dan Herman, everybody.
3569480	3578480	That's the news from Lake Gotham where the children are victims.
3578480	3581480	The poor are enslaved.
3581480	3587480	And everyone's spirit will be broken.
3587480	3588480	Here we go.
3588480	3589480	That was great.
3589480	3594480	Thank you.
3594480	3595480	D&D transitions.
3596480	3599480	Spencer, tell us what happened.
3599480	3601480	Catch us up in D&D land.
3625480	3643480	27No.
3643480	3645480	It was time to fight.
3645480	3660480	All right, let's dramatically let me set the stage you guys it just slashed through the wall of a giant organ and climbed inside in a large blob of goo drop down from the ceiling.
3660480	3667480	And it was followed by like sparks of light that kind of skittered around as if they had spidery limbs.
3667480	3673480	So in this episode, do we pretend Jeff isn't there?
3673480	3679480	For the purposes of this episode, Quark will be played by Spencer Crittenden.
3679480	3683480	Thanks, guys.
3683480	3689480	Quark's going to like Moraine in this episode. Who knows what's going to happen? Let's work together.
3689480	3692480	Take notes, man. The Dungeon Master is playing a character.
3692480	3700480	Hey, Spencer, let's just let's glue our arms together for life. So when Jeff comes back, we're one being.
3700480	3701480	Just an idea.
3701480	3703480	That's a good plan.
3703480	3706480	All right. So these are spider creatures.
3706480	3710480	There's spider lightning creatures in a multi-limbed blob on the ground.
3710480	3714480	Multi-limbed blob spider lightning spider creatures.
3714480	3725480	Sounds like a day at the office.
3725480	3731480	I just tasted what Rob Schneider had for lunch last Wednesday.
3731480	3736480	Spencer, are the lightning spiders trying to attack us?
3736480	3742480	As it happens, the lightning spiders are crawling over the cut that you slashed in the wall.
3742480	3745480	They're sewing it back together.
3745480	3751480	The slimy blob whips around a tendril or two and goo is cast all about the organ.
3751480	3755480	It seems like it's going to be hard to move about.
3755480	3757480	I appreciate the craftiness.
3757480	3758480	Yeah.
3758480	3760480	Because the goo is sticky?
3760480	3765480	You haven't touched it, but goo tends to be.
3765480	3767480	You haven't met my goo.
3767480	3769480	Oh, damn.
3770480	3771480	Smooth as silk.
3771480	3774480	Yeah.
3774480	3780480	Slippery is a baby in January.
3780480	3784480	Chewy is blueberry bubblegum.
3784480	3787480	Okay, all right.
3787480	3791480	And there's no way we're getting out of this room without either retreating,
3791480	3795480	which doesn't even seem possible because of the holes being sewn up,
3795480	3797480	or confronting this thing.
3797480	3802480	We're not able to be the coward that I'd like to be.
3802480	3804480	Correct.
3804480	3807480	Two, the lightning creatures approach.
3807480	3811480	I shoot two arrows.
3811480	3813480	That's a lightning creature.
3813480	3815480	What kind of arrows?
3815480	3816480	Adventure arrows?
3816480	3818480	Nope.
3818480	3820480	You have the special kind that are against the shooting.
3820480	3824480	Regular arrows, good arrows, sleep arrows, V arrows.
3824480	3826480	Does good just mean good skill?
3826480	3830480	It does extra damage against evil creatures.
3830480	3832480	Okay, I shoot two good arrows.
3832480	3833480	All right.
3833480	3835480	What was that, Sharpie?
3835480	3837480	I remember him telling you there was a type of arrow you had
3837480	3840480	that was optimized for multiple arrow shooting.
3840480	3841480	Yeah.
3841480	3842480	Isn't that true?
3842480	3844480	That's true.
3844480	3846480	I already rolled the dice.
3846480	3848480	V arrows?
3848480	3853480	One of your good arrows strikes the lightning directly in the center of mass.
3853480	3856480	It does six damage.
3856480	3860480	Spencer, are my double arrows the V arrows?
3860480	3862480	Yeah, V arrows.
3862480	3863480	Okay, cool.
3863480	3864480	Sorry, guys.
3864480	3866480	What about her second arrow?
3866480	3868480	I get a bad feeling about this.
3868480	3869480	That just missed.
3869480	3871480	It didn't go into anything comically.
3871480	3873480	It went to heaven.
3873480	3875480	God ate it.
3875480	3878480	All right.
3878480	3882480	No, sir, I have to warn you.
3882480	3884480	I don't know if you heard the Brooklyn show,
3884480	3886480	but after giving Ray of Frost its own theme song,
3886480	3891480	we found out it is a level zero spell that does a maximum of three damage.
3891480	3894480	We're going to need to start getting enthusiastic
3894480	3897480	about what I'm told is my most powerful spell.
3897480	3901480	Scorching Ray!
3901480	3914480	Scorching Ray is here.
3914480	3917480	Hit the...
3917480	3919480	Did you...
3919480	3922480	Did you...
3922480	3925480	Scorching Ray is going to burn a motherfucker.
3925480	3926480	Fuck your mama.
3926480	3929480	Okay, done.
3929480	3930480	I'm sorry.
3930480	3931480	Who do you fire it at?
3931480	3934480	There's the slime blob and some lightning things.
3934480	3935480	Oh, oh.
3935480	3939480	I'm scorching Ray at the tentacle that's making the goo.
3939480	3940480	Sounds good.
3940480	3945480	You strike it, dealing some amount of damage.
3945480	3946480	19 damage.
3946480	3954480	Whoa!
3954480	3956480	Going down the aisle.
3956480	3958480	Everyone's prepared now.
3958480	3962480	My relationship with the audience is back.
3962480	3965480	Or, shall I say, he's something racist.
3965480	3968480	Indian people, what's wrong with them?
3968480	3969480	Oh, shit.
3969480	3971480	I lost it again.
3971480	3972480	All right.
3972480	3978480	Scorching Ray!
3978480	3980480	High five, everybody.
3980480	3982480	Minneapolis.
3982480	3987480	Fuck your mama like an Acropolis.
3988480	3989480	Who's at the door?
3989480	3991480	Is it timing?
3991480	3994480	Come on, in fun.
3994480	3996480	You were in here already.
3996480	3997480	We got two funs.
3997480	3999480	We'll get along with this fun.
3999480	4000480	All right.
4000480	4001480	Sorry about that, podcast listeners.
4001480	4004480	You know, the joy that humans get out of high five.
4004480	4008480	Dan just ran out into the audience and high fived everyone.
4008480	4009480	Everyone is very excited.
4009480	4013480	Dan ran out into the audience,
4013480	4019480	giving salutations and greetings with his physical hand
4019480	4023480	to the populace of Lake Wobegard.
4023480	4025480	The pies were cooling.
4025480	4028480	The mashed potatoes were ripe.
4028480	4031480	And the cranberries were...
4031480	4032480	All above average.
4032480	4034480	Cran.
4034480	4036480	Batman.
4036480	4037480	Sorry.
4037480	4038480	Scorching Ray.
4038480	4039480	19 damage.
4039480	4043480	A little excited.
4043480	4044480	Quark pipes up.
4044480	4048480	Hey, guys.
4048480	4050480	I licked vodka out of my own mustache,
4050480	4054480	and a guy in the front row went, ugh.
4054480	4057480	I never had...
4057480	4059480	First of all, I did it because I was excited.
4059480	4061480	Second of all, it was delicious.
4061480	4063480	So I had that double pleasure,
4063480	4065480	but then a third of my brain became shameful.
4065480	4066480	He was excited.
4066480	4067480	He has a liquor on facial hair.
4067480	4068480	It reminded me of the playground,
4068480	4071480	and I found out in the bathroom in grade school
4071480	4074480	when all the kids started laughing at me at the urinal,
4074480	4076480	because I didn't know until sixth grade
4076480	4078480	that when you peed at urinal,
4078480	4080480	you're not supposed to pull your underwear and pants
4080480	4082480	all the way down to your ankles
4082480	4085480	and pee like a little cartoon boy from a Norman Rockwell.
4085480	4087480	You were like a Norman Rockwell painting.
4087480	4091480	Sorry, Spencer.
4091480	4092480	Quark pipes up.
4092480	4093480	Hey, guys.
4093480	4096480	Well, I have a frog in my throat,
4096480	4097480	but I'm ready to fight.
4097480	4099480	I'm a barbarian. I fight things.
4099480	4101480	Yeah, hey, Quark.
4101480	4107480	I tell Quark to go into a kind of zen state
4107480	4110480	where the universe,
4110480	4112480	aka the dungeon master,
4112480	4116480	kind of optimizes his behavior, his choices.
4116480	4118480	I don't know about that.
4118480	4120480	I thought I might just go into a barbarian rage.
4120480	4123480	Yeah!
4123480	4126480	But first, if something happens to me,
4126480	4129480	you got to take my smoke sticks.
4129480	4131480	I'm trying to quit, but...
4131480	4133480	Here, well, grab your smoke sticks.
4133480	4135480	Grabbing his smoke sticks.
4135480	4137480	He whips out his sword.
4137480	4139480	His muscles rise and grow in mass
4139480	4142480	as he falls into the barbarian rage.
4142480	4146480	Red goes over his eyes as all semblance of reason exits his head,
4146480	4151480	and he charges himself directly at the slime monster.
4152480	4154480	And he misses.
4157480	4159480	Yeah.
4159480	4161480	Sharpie.
4161480	4162480	Yes.
4162480	4166480	I know this might be dangerous, but I have a few...
4166480	4168480	I have 20, but I can only shoot two at a time.
4168480	4170480	I have Z arrows.
4170480	4172480	Yeah, yeah, those are optimized for shooting more than one.
4172480	4174480	You know what Z stands for?
4174480	4175480	What?
4175480	4177480	Nothing.
4178480	4182480	I shoot two vagina arrows.
4186480	4188480	Spiders.
4188480	4192480	Which means that they're complicated, smooth, and pink.
4194480	4196480	And they have teeth, right?
4196480	4197480	Just mine.
4197480	4199480	Oh, is that a myth?
4199480	4202480	Your arrows fail to hit their mark.
4202480	4205480	They plant harmlessly in the side of the membrane.
4205480	4207480	Well, it's still cute. It's still cute what they do.
4207480	4209480	Arguable.
4210480	4213480	One of the lightning creatures approaches
4213480	4215480	and jumps directly on Sharpie's face.
4215480	4216480	No!
4216480	4219480	You take six damage and you have a thing on your face.
4220480	4222480	That's a secondary effect.
4222480	4223480	Yep.
4223480	4225480	I only have 24 hit points total.
4225480	4227480	Was I at full health before this fight started?
4227480	4229480	Yeah, you got some of those crystals
4229480	4231480	from the broken healing pendant,
4231480	4233480	so you guys are all at full health.
4233480	4235480	Sir, when do I get an animal?
4235480	4239480	I want to say fourth level, maybe fifth.
4239480	4241480	So today?
4241480	4243480	No.
4243480	4246480	I'm, uh, no.
4248480	4251480	Well, I just want to utilize the powers of the secret
4251480	4253480	and just say I'd like an animal.
4253480	4254480	Hey, get this thing off my face.
4254480	4256480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4256480	4262480	I take a single sure shot arrow.
4262480	4263480	Okay.
4263480	4265480	Is that a thing? Did I write that?
4265480	4267480	Uh, yeah.
4267480	4270480	Uh, it says always hits every time
4270480	4272480	and my name is Spencer
4272480	4274480	and I'm going to give you a spirit animal.
4274480	4275480	Awesome.
4275480	4276480	So you fall out of here.
4276480	4279480	You fire the arrow directly into your foot.
4283480	4285480	Okay, all right. I shoot a good arrow.
4285480	4287480	Did you really have an arrow that said sure shot?
4287480	4288480	No.
4288480	4291480	Aaron. Aaron.
4291480	4292480	I know these things, you guys.
4292480	4294480	There's a lot of pressure as a comptroller.
4294480	4296480	A lot of pressure to line?
4296480	4297480	No.
4297480	4298480	To make up an arrow?
4298480	4300480	I'm going to love that voice.
4300480	4302480	Oh, Aaron.
4304480	4312480	Um, I shoot a baby arrow into Sharpie's heart.
4312480	4316480	Um, I shoot a, uh, I shoot a good arrow.
4316480	4317480	Okay.
4317480	4318480	I shoot a good arrow.
4318480	4319480	Okay.
4319480	4320480	And I shoot it good.
4320480	4321480	At his face?
4321480	4323480	No, I shoot, I shoot it at the spider.
4323480	4325480	On his face?
4325480	4327480	Well, if it's on his face right now, then yes.
4327480	4330480	Yeah, but there's also other spiders, so I mean...
4330480	4333480	Well, the one, the one that is, is most threatening Sharpie.
4333480	4335480	So the one on his face.
4335480	4339480	I'm just, this clarification is important.
4339480	4341480	Yes, the one on his face.
4341480	4343480	Unless there's another one that's threatening him more.
4343480	4344480	Nope.
4344480	4346480	Um, pulling an arrow from your quiver.
4346480	4349480	You lose it directly at his face.
4350480	4354480	You seem to think this might not be the best of ideas.
4354480	4355480	Spencer!
4355480	4356480	This was your idea!
4356480	4358480	Remember the first table?
4358480	4360480	It couldn't have been more elucidated.
4360480	4364480	You guys had a ten-minute conversation about whether you're going to shoot me in the fucking face.
4369480	4374480	It strikes the lightning spider in one of his several spidery limbs.
4374480	4377480	He takes five damage.
4378480	4382480	At least that's something I didn't hit you in the face.
4382480	4385480	Wounded, the animal skitters away.
4385480	4388480	Hey! Yeah! Yeah!
4388480	4390480	Fuck you!
4390480	4391480	Doubters.
4391480	4394480	Charles Burroughs, what was his name?
4395480	4399480	The slime whips a wicked tendril directly at Mulrane.
4399480	4402480	It strikes you right in the leg and grasps.
4402480	4406480	You feel the burn of acid against your flesh and you take eight damage.
4407480	4410480	I guess I deserve this.
4411480	4414480	You're also being grappled.
4414480	4415480	Oh.
4415480	4417480	That means stuff.
4417480	4418480	What?
4418480	4420480	That means stuff, but I mean, yeah.
4420480	4423480	Like rules-wise, but don't worry about it.
4424480	4432480	Um, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I keep forgetting what mage hand is.
4432480	4435480	It lets you telekinetically move around light objects.
4435480	4436480	Ah, all right.
4436480	4438480	Frost, sir, come on.
4438480	4440480	I mean, why don't you marry it?
4440480	4445480	It is a maximum three-hit-point damage spell.
4445480	4446480	It is a...
4446480	4448480	Scratching Frost!
4448480	4451480	It's not, it's scorching Rey, sir.
4451480	4454480	Not scorching Frost.
4454480	4460480	At this point in the podcast, I'd like to implore anyone either named Rey Frost
4460480	4463480	or from a town called Frost named Rey
4464480	4468480	to come to the podcast because you will be, there will be a crown on your head.
4468480	4473480	If there was a spell called scorching Frost, don't you think that the net effect of it would be minimal?
4476480	4479480	Scorching Frost is a glass of water.
4480480	4485480	I want to cast Burning Hands, if it's my turn, on the grappling tentacle
4485480	4490480	to try to get it to release its grip from my face-shooting girlfriend.
4490480	4496480	Fanning your hands wide, you emit a thin flame, sheet of flame.
4499480	4503480	It deals nine damage, it slices the tentacle in half.
4503480	4513480	Well, he don't know, and he slash the tentacle.
4515480	4516480	I attack!
4516480	4519480	That was, that was Quark attacking in a rage.
4519480	4521480	Oh, nice. I thought that was the tentacle.
4521480	4524480	No, I was just having an episode, you guys.
4525480	4527480	He critically hits!
4530480	4532480	We call that the Mitch Hurwitz.
4533480	4537480	Dealing 22 damage and felling the slime.
4537480	4540480	Only four lightning spiders remain.
4542480	4543480	All right.
4543480	4545480	They scuttle to the ceiling.
4545480	4548480	Well, all right. Well, it sounds like they're getting out of our way here.
4548480	4551480	Well, they are. They're out of your way now. Now you're in an organ.
4551480	4553480	So the tentacle thing is done?
4553480	4556480	The tentacle thing's done. Spiders on the ceiling.
4556480	4558480	They're just kind of watching at this point.
4558480	4562480	All right. Well, we should get out of this room.
4564480	4565480	It's a lung.
4565480	4566480	It's a lung.
4567480	4569480	Yeah, someone's been paying attention.
4570480	4572480	Prince of Alicent pipes up.
4572480	4576480	Hey, guys, we came around to destroy this fish from the inside, yeah?
4576480	4577480	Yeah.
4578480	4581480	So do you want to destroy it from the inside?
4584480	4588480	I'm saying let's slice this mother up!
4589480	4592480	Also, somebody in the audience yelled out, smoke sticks.
4592480	4595480	If we're, if we're, if we're sitting in the lung, like, like,
4595480	4598480	let's, let's Yule Brenner this motherfucker.
4599480	4602480	It's almost as if I set you up for it all along.
4602480	4604480	I know. Well, then you said slice this, yeah. All right.
4604480	4607480	Throwing the pack of smoke sticks on the ground.
4607480	4610480	And I, we do that, and then I also light on my torches.
4610480	4614480	Lighting your torches in unison with the throwing of the smoke sticks.
4614480	4617480	Acrid smoke is released into the lung.
4617480	4621480	You hear violent spasms for a while.
4623480	4627480	We should, we should, maybe, I don't know, I don't know if our job is to get out of here
4627480	4630480	or stay and be coughed up or...
4630480	4633480	Let's see next time! Cliffhanger!
4633480	4635480	Okay, fine. Yeah, good idea. All right.
4635480	4637480	Spencer, ladies and gentlemen.
4637480	4641480	Spencer!
4642480	4644480	Thanks, Spencer.
4645480	4648480	Gathering his character sheets.
4648480	4653480	The Viking-like figure and his red tartan sweat jacket
4654480	4657480	proceeds off the stage and into the 20 below weather
4657480	4661480	wearing his shorts from Los Angeles.
4661480	4664480	You don't know if he'll live or die.
4665480	4670480	His beard seems scarf-like, but will it save him from hypothermia?
4671480	4674480	He's entitled to a save versus...
4675480	4676480	That was an action.
4676480	4677480	All right.
4677480	4678480	It's all right.
4679480	4681480	Working out the kinks.
4681480	4683480	Do you want me to leave the stage?
4683480	4684480	No, no, you don't have to.
4684480	4685480	Just make it sure.
4685480	4687480	I never want you to leave the stage, Spencer.
4687480	4688480	Thanks, you guys who are here.
4688480	4690480	Not only do I not want you to leave the stage,
4690480	4693480	I want you to get into my bed.
4695480	4696480	For the podcast listeners,
4696480	4698480	there is a very expensive heart-shaped bed
4698480	4700480	raising on a platform right now
4700480	4703480	with pyrotechnics going off all around it,
4703480	4706480	and Isaac Hayes is playing a keyboard in the corner.
4706480	4708480	You just put it on mute.
4709480	4712480	Spencer, get into my bed.
4712480	4715480	Gonna fuck your mama in her head.
4715480	4718480	Put my dick into her Spencer mom's eye.
4718480	4720480	I rolled her pussy die.
4720480	4722480	Yo, rolled her pussy die.
4722480	4724480	Got a three and a four.
4724480	4725480	Added it up.
4725480	4726480	I got a bonus and more.
4726480	4729480	With my Vorpal dick, I want to put it in it.
4729480	4733480	I put my dick in your mama's cave and dungeoned it.
4733480	4735480	I went down to the Spelunk the Depths.
4735480	4737480	Fuck your mama so hard,
4737480	4740480	she looked like death.
4740480	4741480	She was a skull and bones.
4741480	4743480	I fucked your mama so hard.
4743480	4745480	She said, don't leave me alone.
4745480	4747480	Spencer's daddy came in and said,
4747480	4748480	what's going on?
4748480	4750480	I said, holy shit.
4750480	4752480	Sorry.
4752480	4755480	Down to Harmon Town.
4755480	4757480	Turn that frown upside down.
4757480	4758480	Oedipus.
4758480	4761480	These yellow poop is from myth.
4761480	4763480	Come on down to Harmon Town.
4763480	4766480	Working the crowd, going down the aisle.
4766480	4769480	Fucking your mama mile after motherfucking mile.
4769480	4772480	Twin cities got St. Paul and Minneapolis.
4772480	4773480	I fucked your mama.
4773480	4775480	There's an amp from a dick in that.
4775480	4778480	I fucked your mama so hard with my iPhone 5.
4778480	4779480	I fucked your mama.
4779480	4781480	She said, I've never felt more alive.
4781480	4783480	I fucked your mama in their eye and her tooth.
4783480	4785480	I fucked your mama ain't a lie.
4785480	4786480	It's a motherfucking truth.
4786480	4788480	I fucked your mama.
4788480	4789480	In her beard, in her ear.
4789480	4790480	I fucked your mama.
4790480	4791480	I had no fear.
4791480	4793480	I fucked your mama like a corn ear.
4793480	4795480	I fucked your mama and I shocked your pussy.
4796480	4799480	I fucked your like Gary Bussy.
4799480	4802480	Come on down to Harmon Town.
4802480	4805480	Turn that frown upside down.
4805480	4808480	These yellow poop is from truth.
4808480	4811480	Come on down to Harmon Town.
4811480	4812480	Working the crowd.
4812480	4814480	What's your name, Peter?
4814480	4817480	Peter, I fucked your mama in this theater.
4817480	4819480	I fucked her right on this floor.
4819480	4823480	There's a red rug here, but it's going to get red some more.
4824480	4826480	Because I gave her menstruation.
4826480	4829480	I fucked your mama all across this great motherfucking nation.
4829480	4831480	I fucked her in Canada too.
4831480	4832480	It counts in Toronto.
4832480	4834480	I fucked your mama like Lone Ranger.
4834480	4837480	I fucked your mama Prano.
4837480	4838480	I did it right split.
4838480	4841480	I fucked your mama, then I gave her a little tit.
4841480	4842480	A bonus one.
4842480	4844480	So now she's got three.
4844480	4847480	I fucked your mama, then I poured her a cup of lemonade.
4847480	4848480	Site P.
4848480	4850480	I made her drink my pee.
4850480	4851480	No, go ahead.
4851480	4853480	You can sing it.
4853480	4854480	Sorry.
4854480	4855480	Sorry.
4855480	4857480	The poop is proud.
4857480	4859480	Come on down to Harmon Town.
4859480	4862480	Lights above me like stars twinkin' bright.
4862480	4865480	I fucked your mama like Muhammad Ali didn't fight.
4865480	4868480	I rope a doped her ass with my big dick.
4868480	4871480	I put her on the ropes and then made her sick.
4871480	4873480	She puked out my penis.
4873480	4879480	And then I gathered it up and I took it and put it in a chocolate like slop.
4879480	4881480	It's a form of slop.
4881480	4883480	If you're a real farmer, you'd know.
4883480	4890480	It's terminology that, you know, let me clarify.
4890480	4892480	Rhythm.
4892480	4893480	Rhythm.
4893480	4895480	Dancing.
4895480	4898480	We're transitioning to a dance.
4898480	4900480	No, no, no, hold on, silence.
4900480	4902480	Give me the silence I deserve.
4902480	4904480	I deserve silence.
4904480	4906480	I rapped badly.
4906480	4908480	Toddler dance in the aisles.
4908480	4909480	Yeah.
4909480	4911480	A rap band.
4911480	4912480	A rap band.
4912480	4913480	A rap band.
4913480	4914480	A rap band.
4914480	4915480	A rap band.
4915480	4916480	A rap band.
4916480	4917480	Put your mama's pussy in a treasure chest.
4917480	4919480	Put my dick in between her big motherfucking breasts.
4919480	4922480	Took her outside where it's cold as hell.
4922480	4925480	I fucked your mama in the cold so she couldn't even tell,
4925480	4927480	because her pussy was numb from the cold.
4927480	4931480	What I told the Janeiro is that fucking weather is bold.
4931480	4934480	She got an icicle instead of my wiener.
4934480	4936480	I fucked your mama.
4936480	4940480	It was cleaner the first time when I did it a year ago.
4940480	4942480	Then I did it this time.
4942480	4943480	It seemed dirtier, bro.
4943480	4945480	What happened inside there?
4945480	4946480	Did she make it dirty?
4946480	4949480	Uh, maybe she should be a little less flirty.
4949480	4951480	Uh, I took her to a party once.
4951480	4952480	No.
4952480	4953480	No chorus.
4953480	4954480	No.
4954480	4955480	Just spitting.
4955480	4956480	Spitting fire.
4956480	4958480	Keep on doing the rhymes.
4958480	4961480	I don't give a motherfucking shit what I do this time.
4961480	4964480	Pacing the stage like a motherfucking tiger.
4964480	4967480	I fucked your mama like my name was William Riker.
4967480	4970480	Went onto the bridge and said, hey, Picard,
4970480	4973480	I'm gonna fuck your mama so hard she gets into the prison yard.
4973480	4976480	Walking dead, season three, killer ass,
4976480	4978480	like she was a fucking zombie.
4978480	4981480	Later out, head of the class, Howard Hesford came and said,
4981480	4982480	what's going on?
4982480	4985480	I fucked your mama so hard she thought my dick was a tampon.
4985480	4988480	I fucked it wasn't that time of month was she blood.
4988480	4991480	I fucked your mama so hard and left away she's dead.
4991480	4994480	Laid in a pool of her own viscera.
4994480	4997480	I fucked your mama and nobody's kissing her.
4997480	4999480	She's dead.
4999480	5000480	She's alone.
5000480	5001480	It's a tragedy.
5001480	5002480	It's not funny.
5002480	5006480	But I laughed at me because I did it brutally.
5006480	5008480	I had no remorse.
5008480	5010480	And I did it with impunity.
5010480	5012480	There was no sentencing.
5012480	5013480	There was no jury.
5013480	5016480	I fucked your mama and then murdered her.
5017480	5020480	And really, if you step back and think about it,
5020480	5023480	there's nothing funny about it.
5023480	5024480	I'm sorry.
5024480	5028480	I really revealed some dark shit.
5028480	5031480	But it's a dark city.
5031480	5034480	Now you can come back.
5034480	5037480	Come on down to Harman town, Rocky.
5037480	5039480	Turn that frown upside down.

5075480	5076480	Yeah.
5076480	5078480	Looking like you're having just another spasm.
5078480	5079480	What is that shit?
5079480	5081480	I cannot even fathom.
5081480	5082480	Look at this fandom.
5082480	5084480	It is so fucking random.
5084480	5086480	Kids from 2 to 20 and more.
5086480	5088480	It is plenty of girls too.
5088480	5090480	They looking kind of fine.
5090480	5091480	But not like this dude.

5105480	5106480	One more time.
5106480	5107480	Austin rocked it.
5107480	5108480	It can't go no further.
5108480	5110480	She keeps doing the credits.
5110480	5112480	Sorry, I started rapping one.
5112480	5114480	Pretend Austin ended the show.
5116480	5117480	One more time.
5117480	5118480	Everyone else, together.

5122480	5123480	What?
5123480	5124480	Nothing.
5124480	5126480	She was trying to take it to the chorus.
5127480	5128480	Okay.
5128480	5129480	Yeah.
5129480	5130480	My shoes are attached.

5165480	5166480	Stand it out, please.
5166480	5168480	You get it on par.
5168480	5171480	Every time it stands up, it's rapping a little bit more.
5171480	5172480	I'm going to disappoint you.
5172480	5174480	I'm going to let you down.
5174480	5177480	I fucked your mama so hard, she went to ground round.
5177480	5180480	Okay, but she waved like David Spade in the Rubbermaid.
5180480	5183480	Threw her ass away into the garbage and laid my day.
