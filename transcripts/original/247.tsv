0	10360	Well, I was gone for far too long, but now I'm back.
10360	17840	I was gone for too long, your comptroller was black.
17840	20760	But now I'm back and here to stay.
20760	32520	And all I want to say is, some people call me Pringles Dick,
32520	36400	but I never really found out why.
36400	38880	I don't really have a Pringles Dick,
38880	42840	I just keep my dick inside.
42840	45240	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can
45240	49280	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
49280	51720	Some people call me Pringles Dick,
51720	53560	but I never really found out.
53560	55280	No, I never found out.
55280	57080	I never really found out why.
57080	58920	If you know, sing along.
58920	65320	Some people call me Pringles Dick, but never found out why.
65320	67840	I don't really have a Pringles Dick,
67840	71800	I just keep my dick inside.
71800	74200	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can
74200	78280	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
78280	80760	Some people call me Pringles Dick,
80760	84400	but I never really found out.
84400	87640	I never really found out why.
87640	89080	Ladies and gentlemen, hit it.
89080	100880	From beautiful uptown Burbank, Hermiton is now in session.
108880	109880	Spencer Clinton.
119480	122280	And the mayor of Hermitown, I've missed you so much,
122280	123280	Mr. Dan Harmons.
136280	138680	You left your shit everywhere.
142200	147240	How does the video, should I put this back further out?
147240	149000	Or should I?
149000	151080	OK, we're good, all right.
151080	152760	When I watch the feed, I like the shot
152760	154920	where you get a clear shot of Spencer,
154920	157160	then the mannequins back there, it looks beautiful.
157160	160720	$5 a month, and you'd know what I was talking about.
160720	161920	Thank you guys for coming out.
161920	163400	Thanks for coming to Burbank.
163400	168320	Thanks for living in Burbank if you live here.
168320	170720	Somebody to panic and borrow for the show.
170720	172840	Anybody pen, pencil?
172840	174520	There's a little bit of official business.
174520	180040	I mean, we've been getting this venue up and running,
180040	183760	and we can't be an official.
183760	187080	We can't sell you booze, so great.
187080	188240	We have to give it to you.
191120	194840	I love that about society.
194840	196240	Legally, it has to be free.
199720	203200	That's the kind of Pringles professor you like.
203200	205280	He stops the party in the library and says,
205280	207960	you need to read books about Pringles then.
207960	209200	And it had no sense.
212880	215840	But it's like free-flowing hard liquor.
215840	218000	But I don't think that's the problem.
218000	221040	As you know, if you're here live,
221040	222880	we had to start checking your bags tonight.
222880	225600	Now here's why.
225600	228480	You're coming here to listen to me complain about our descent
228480	231520	into fascism, and now you have to pretty soon there's
231520	234440	going to be metal detectors out there.
234440	237440	What can I say about Burbank?
237440	240600	It's a tougher hood, man.
240600	243360	What it is is just like we've got a nice big room now.
243360	245640	We can fit a lot of you in here.
245640	246720	There's a free spirit.
246720	248160	We're anarchists.
248160	249280	We love no rules.
249280	251000	Somebody's got something to say.
251000	254000	They say it, et cetera.
254000	256400	But so now it's like, OK, how do we
256400	259320	coexist as a civilization?
259320	262680	People have been bringing shit and getting shit-faced.
262680	265120	Like if you just brought stuff, maybe it's
265120	267040	illegal for me to say this, but if you just brought stuff
267040	268400	and you could see, there you go.
268400	272160	You heard somebody right there falling over.
272160	276080	But I mean, just anecdotally, there were a couple of guys
276080	279440	apparently last episode, or maybe one before that.
279440	280040	I can't remember.
280040	285200	But we just have your standard security people.
285200	293040	They didn't sign up to do any heart surgery or like they
293040	294480	had to bounce a couple of guys.
294480	296600	And I guess one guy immediately as soon as he got,
296600	298000	because they were just shit-faced,
298000	300240	like walking into walls.
300240	302280	And then they went out as a pair.
302280	305480	And one of them, the official report on our side
305480	310080	was that he turned to Jell-O. He fell to the floor
310080	312000	and started pissing and shitting himself
312000	314640	and couldn't get up.
314640	316800	His friend took off running because he
316800	321240	had a $50,000 warrant.
321240	324360	So thank you for letting us check your purse.
324360	325480	It's not you.
325480	328120	It's those two guys.
328120	330480	But also, it's like, I'm sorry if I caught you off guard
330480	332520	because it's like, well, maybe you have weed in your purse.
332520	334520	And you're like, what is this, the fucking thing?
334520	340360	And there's been people smoking inside here.
340360	344000	And it's like, it's all, if you just
344000	346440	run it through the flowchart of like,
346440	348280	am I hurting anyone around me?
348280	351360	Am I interfering with anyone else's good time?
351360	354480	Which also doubles as when a cop comes in here,
354480	357480	is this place going to get shut down?
357480	358960	Because that cheats everybody.
358960	361920	So in order to keep honest, people honest, we're just kind
361920	365400	of going, OK, so we're going to check your bags and stuff.
365400	367560	But I'm not looking at this as a,
367560	372040	this is our chance to explore how societies begin.
372040	374320	I'm sure, minus the electronics,
374320	377000	this is basically equivalent to the first Thanksgiving, right?
379640	381480	Listen, some of you, I understand
381480	384520	you make houses out of buffalo.
384520	389600	Look, we love it, but I don't know.
389600	393680	But you've got to accept these smallpox.
393680	397120	It's called a social contract.
397120	400920	But anyways, so if any of you are miffed by that,
400920	402400	you can continue to be miffed by that.
402400	403800	I'm not telling you to not be miffed
403800	405640	by any invasion of your stuff.
405640	407520	But it's like, we're just doing what
407520	411480	we can to bottleneck the inhumanity so that everybody
411480	413760	can have a good time.
413760	416240	And the other official business is Jeff's back.
416240	416740	Hello.
420680	422720	I've missed you guys.
422720	423760	It's been a long time.
423760	425000	I've been enjoying listening to the show though.
425000	426440	I thought Brandon did a bang up job.
426440	429680	Brandon is amazing.
429840	433680	I kind of felt like, not nervous to come back,
433680	437640	but I felt like maybe he had stolen everybody's hearts away.
437640	438840	I like what it's brought out of you.
438840	440520	You come back with a ukulele.
440520	442000	It's good to see you on your time.
442000	446840	I felt like I had to put some hee-haw showbiz into this shit.
446840	453200	The downside was it also brought out a lash of racism.
453200	457440	But I'd rather just have all of you.
458080	459280	He was black the entire time.
459280	460560	He was black.
460560	462720	Also, I feel so nervous about coming back.
462720	464880	At Spencer and I at the halfway mark of the show,
464880	468440	we're going to do love letters.
468440	470920	Yeah, it's a nice stage set up now.
470920	474040	That's a play that two people do.
474040	475880	We're moving toward, there's going
475880	477600	to be a wireless environment up here.
477600	479720	It's going to be like going to an Apple keynote
479720	481720	pretty soon one day.
481720	484680	I'm going to come out in a turtleneck or maybe
484680	487200	a turtle and a half neck.
488160	490200	A turtle and a half neck.
490200	492720	That's pretty awesome.
492720	494200	It comes up to your lower lip.
494200	495080	I don't know.
495080	496800	I was just figuring I'm two turtle.
496800	497760	I have one and a half turtles.
497760	498080	I don't know.
498080	498600	It's pretty good.
498600	499080	I don't know.
499080	499800	I'm kind of good.
499800	502480	You know, this venue is awakening the entertainer in me.
502480	503640	A turtle and a half neck.
503640	507800	See, my ukulele inspired the vaudeville showbiz guy
507800	508480	inside you.
508480	509400	Yeah.
509400	513440	Well, let's try something real quick.
513440	515440	Speaking of, because we were testing the equipment
515520	519240	and, you know, so, you know, a little harm
519240	521160	and try to strike a balance between the, you know,
521160	522560	you don't want to turn it into a TV show
522560	523920	because the people listening.
523920	526880	But that doesn't preclude like the music stuff.
526880	530280	So I got my, I got my garage band
530280	533040	and you got your ukulele and then.
533040	534120	Oh, awesome.
534120	535520	Wait, should I get my ukulele out?
535520	536400	Oh, yeah.
536400	538920	Well, I mean, if you want.
538920	539400	Yeah.
543800	544640	Yeah.
544640	546640	I've been enjoying, if you guys have not treated yourself
546640	549760	to Dan's garage band, like little Instagram videos,
549760	551000	they're pretty tasty.
551000	552000	Yeah.
552000	554640	You can really find out what it's like to hear Dan sing
554640	555760	about pooping.
555760	556680	Oh.
556680	558120	Oh, what are you talking about?
558120	560200	You're saying, oh, well, I guess since I open garage band,
560200	562840	I might as well play one of my songs.
562840	563800	I think you should.
563800	565360	Have you got a new one for us?
565360	566440	No, it's a classic.
566440	567440	No, it's a classic.
567440	570920	From outer space.
570920	572280	For those of you who are following me,
573000	581600	see, you've been displaced from your being best friends.
581600	584960	It's where you come from, where other beings go.
584960	587120	I'm just a lonely potato.
587120	590360	I only know what I know and I know
590360	595360	I was born in the dirt and the earth is above a shed.
595360	599320	But now I can't move you from me and mine.
599400	603240	Being from outer space.
607960	608440	See.
610680	611200	Wow.
615480	618040	That one I did for my bean, Cody.
618040	620440	That was somewhere right in the middle, like equidistant
620440	623880	between Lenny Kravitz and Abba.
623880	628120	With a lengthy stop at George Michael's filling station.
628120	629240	Oh, yeah.
629240	632200	It's where you come from, where other beings grow.
632200	634160	I'm just a lonely potato.
634160	640040	I only know what I know and I know I was born in the dirt.
640040	642400	All right.
642400	643840	You should have a fucking record.
643840	645000	You can have a record, Dan.
645000	647680	I'm going to see if Logical maybe produced my album.
647680	649000	Yeah.
649000	650880	Now that he's number one, boy, is he
650880	652160	going to regret becoming friends with me
652160	655760	before he became a number one hip hop artist.
655760	657560	I'm like texting him every day.
657560	659360	I'm like, what do you think of this?
659360	661320	He's like, it's hip hop-alicious.
661320	663200	I have to say that from the time I was away
663200	664680	listening to the show, you grew a lot
664680	666680	because you started fucking dads now.
666680	667280	That's great.
667280	667920	I tried.
667920	671080	I tried everything, you know.
671080	674760	All right, well, yeah, but OK, so my new thing is garage band.
674760	676280	Because you don't have to be good at it.
676280	680880	Like, it's a hobby for me now so I can really lose myself in it.
680880	686160	So you were telling me a good chord progression is,
686160	688280	oh, shit, this doesn't have the, where is the G?
688280	689560	Yeah, you made a new song.
689560	692040	Where's the D?
692040	694040	Go back to the old song that you just wrote.
694040	695960	It's OK, we can do CGF as good, too.
695960	697600	OK, well, I see it.
697600	700200	OK, so I'm learning as people are paying to watch.
700200	702120	I'm learning as people are paying to watch.
702120	702960	That's fine.
702960	704680	That's fine.
704680	707360	But the good thing for people listening and not watching
707360	709480	is there's nothing happening on the screen really worth
709480	710240	watching.
710240	712160	No, no, we're not, yeah.
712160	714760	But yeah, one of my favorite thing about garage band
714760	719680	is the strings, because if you rub them hard,
719680	721080	but if you rub them really soft.
725120	729600	It's been seven hours and 15 days.
734640	735800	Wait, you said you said it.
735800	737400	We almost had it, right.
737400	744240	G, G, A, 7, for that is G.
744880	748800	Can we hop this mic back up, the little other guy?
748800	749600	Oh, man.
749600	751680	So D, G, A, 7, D?
751680	753160	Yeah.
753160	757040	That's a nice three chord kind of thing.
757040	759440	Oh, I guess we probably need a metronome, right?
759440	760040	Give me a beat.
764200	766760	Can you put an actual, can you lay a beat in there?
766760	767680	Yeah, I could.
767680	768400	Give us a beat.
768400	770240	What would you like the drummer's name to be?
770240	775040	Uh, I'm a fucking Tommy Lee.
777760	781520	So Cal?
781520	782560	So Cal.
782560	784040	Wait, I thought, OK, wait.
784040	786640	Well, no, wait, how come, how come?
786640	789600	OK, now the people who aren't watching are missing something,
789600	791600	because now there's drums on the thing.
791600	792920	Wait, this is very exciting.
792920	794600	I think it's different if you get a drummer.
794600	796000	OK, drummer.
796000	797520	That's what I need.
797520	799040	OK, you want Leah here?
799040	801040	This is like the scene in the movie Iceman, where
801040	803400	the Iceman finds out that he's an Iceman.
806960	810520	Is that too Silver Lake for you?
810520	813000	Would you like me to change Leah?
813000	815960	I can change Leah to Jay Pfister.
821480	824480	Oh, that's, he's too complicated.
824480	827800	I don't need your parents' divorce involved in my song.
830000	834240	Maurice looks like he's wearing glasses, so I don't know.
834240	836880	All these people are too.
836880	839720	That beat really screams ukulele.
839720	840240	You know what?
840240	844360	You know who I missed, Leah?
844360	845200	Sorry, Leah.
845200	846520	I didn't mean to ever stray.
846520	850000	OK, all right, so there's our beat.
850000	854960	And then, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
855040	855460	eight, nine, ten.
855460	856000	OK, all right.
863680	864360	We're coming.
864360	867560	You see where they're measuring.
867560	869040	Here comes, here we go.
878040	878920	Let's record it.
878920	885240	It will give us a count in and then we'll record it.
885240	889080	We made one hundredth of a song.
889080	893000	No, this is about half the time I spend on my Instagram songs.
893000	894960	All right, so here we go.
894960	897360	Can you make a loop and then improvise a song?
897360	898360	We can record right now.
898360	898840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
898840	900120	So here comes the count in.
908920	911720	Three, two, three, seven, eight.
911720	915720	I've got to do a better loop.
915720	917840	Three, two, three, six, one more loop.
917840	918360	One more loop.
918360	919840	Two, three, four, four.
919840	923980	Three, two, three, six, one more loop.
924060	925780	Two, three, four, four.
933700	936300	Head in, one, two, three, four.
936320	937300	One, two, three, four.
937420	938420	Let's do that.
938420	967980	I didn't know that it was still in there.
967980	968980	All right.
968980	969980	We got to fix that.
969980	970980	We got to fix that.
970980	971980	We got to re-recorded it.
971980	972980	Oh, okay.
972980	973980	Sorry.
973980	974980	Okay, here we go.
974980	975980	One, two, three.
975980	976980	What?
976980	977980	How come it's...
977980	978980	No.
978980	979980	No.

1072980	1075980	Out of there.
1077980	1080980	Out in the.
1080980	1083980	Out of there.
1083980	1085980	Better than men.
1085980	1087980	Not gonna fall in it.
1087980	1089980	Are better than men.
1089980	1092980	Does it matter what note you sing on the chords?
1092980	1095980	Or when you have to sing along with the chords that you know?
1095980	1098980	Can you just say something to the throat?
1101980	1103980	Yes or no?
1105980	1112980	Well it's nice to be back in the heart of the town.
1113980	1117980	It's nice to be back in the heart of the town.
1144980	1146980	Every time.
1146980	1149980	Alright, one more time then we'll get to the show.
1167980	1169980	That's the one.
1174980	1177980	I fucking miss Ryan Stiles so much right now.
1177980	1180980	No, I miss Brandon. Let's get Brandon up here.
1180980	1183980	Brandon Joseph!
1190980	1192980	Hi.
1192980	1195980	God damn it, that was hilarious.
1195980	1197980	I love that last bit where you were like,
1197980	1200980	I give a fuck!
1200980	1203980	Jeff Davis is back everybody.
1204980	1206980	Yes!
1206980	1211980	And I can go back to being the disgraced alderman of Harman Town.
1211980	1215980	Yeah, you did such a good job I was afraid to come back.
1215980	1219980	I thought that you, I liked your version of the show better than me on the show.
1219980	1222980	I can only tell you big shoes to fill.
1222980	1224980	Fucking I had no idea what goes on.
1224980	1226980	There's an entire control panel behind that thing.
1226980	1228980	You gotta sit through two hours of this shit.
1228980	1229980	That's the fucking hard part.
1230980	1233980	Big fancy shoes that only you two know how to talk about.
1235980	1237980	I like those loafers by the way. Those are swinging.
1237980	1239980	Thanks so much. You look amazing.
1239980	1241980	The chain with the jacket.
1241980	1243980	See, I can't wear brown shoes. I look like a bird.
1248980	1251980	So much has changed since you left.
1253980	1254980	He hates it so much.
1254980	1257980	There was one episode when you had the journalists that were from,
1257980	1259980	that had been overseas, like in Iraq and stuff like that,
1259980	1261980	and you kept asking them questions.
1261980	1264980	Well, you started the show by saying that you were really drunk.
1264980	1267980	And you interviewed them, you kept asking questions
1267980	1270980	and then answering their question for them.
1270980	1273980	And I came up with a new term. It's called dance planning.
1277980	1280980	I told her I'm not a good interviewer.
1280980	1283980	I thought it was a good show. I don't care.
1284980	1286980	It was. They were fascinating.
1286980	1287980	Theoretically.
1287980	1293980	I heard a psychology, there was a podcast about emotions that I saw
1293980	1298980	that said that there's this woman who's like the leading rock star
1298980	1301980	of emotional psychology right now,
1301980	1304980	but it's really weird because she's kind of counterintuitive.
1304980	1308980	She realizes herself that her theories and findings
1308980	1312980	actually fly in the face of any support
1312980	1316980	for the kind of safe space,
1316980	1321980	trigger-y thing in that feelings don't happen to you.
1321980	1324980	They're not uncontrollable things.
1325980	1328980	I was kind of like half asleep while I was listening to the podcast,
1328980	1331980	but it was like, it's kind of like we only, the weird thing is,
1331980	1335980	I don't know who figures this shit out.
1335980	1336980	How do you measure this?
1336980	1338980	And who do you know is talking out of their ass when they,
1338980	1342980	I guess that's why you have to look at like certification and stuff
1342980	1343980	and credentials.
1343980	1349980	But according to her, there's only really four actual honest,
1349980	1351980	emotional states for a human that you start with,
1351980	1355980	and I think it's pleasant, unpleasant,
1355980	1360980	aroused, and I can't remember Groupon.
1360980	1363980	I don't know. I can't remember what the fourth one is even.
1364980	1367980	But it's not like angry and it's not jealous and it's not sad.
1367980	1368980	I can't remember what it is,
1368980	1372980	but it's like basically the way that there's only really eight notes.
1372980	1377980	There's only four feelings, but then we,
1377980	1380980	depending culturally, like if you're in ancient Sparta,
1380980	1383980	then you have to have a certain attitude towards murder,
1383980	1386980	death, manhood, womanhood, et cetera.
1386980	1389980	Then if you go down the street to ancient Athens,
1390980	1394980	they're working on the streets and they have,
1394980	1399980	but all of that stuff, all the stuff that we call outrage or jealousy
1399980	1403980	or sadness or rage, like we're actually just,
1403980	1408980	those are all social constructs that we're creating,
1408980	1411980	that we're told we're indoctrinated into them.
1411980	1416980	So when you're a kid on the playground and someone steals your fire truck toy,
1416980	1420980	you feel probably, I would guess, unpleasant about that.
1420980	1422980	And then your parents tell you,
1422980	1424980	or the kid that's taking your fire truck tells you,
1424980	1426980	or somehow you get the signal, you're told,
1426980	1428980	I know you're angry right now.
1428980	1430980	What you're feeling is called anger
1430980	1433980	and it has to do with fire trucks being taken away from you.
1433980	1437980	And so you learn that the same way you learn language.
1437980	1440980	But there's very few uncontrollable emotions,
1440980	1447980	like you just kind of, you have a pretty mellow four-part quartet
1447980	1452980	of pretty almost indistinguishable kind of states of emotion
1452980	1456980	that you then, I didn't really listen to it that much.
1458980	1461980	But she herself was saying, I know this is awful
1461980	1463980	because she's a liberal and a progressive person,
1463980	1465980	but she's saying, this is honest data that I'm getting back,
1465980	1468980	this is the way we really need to look at this,
1468980	1471980	even though it actually suggests like, well, yeah, it doesn't,
1471980	1475980	it's kind of like the scientific way of saying suck it up buttercup
1475980	1477980	in certain contexts.
1477980	1479980	But does that allow for nuances in between?
1479980	1480980	No.
1480980	1482980	You can be angry and different, okay.
1482980	1483980	No, no, I don't know.
1483980	1484980	Our next guest.
1484980	1488980	No, at the top of the podcast episode, they say,
1488980	1491980	because they're doing, and I should, if I'm drawing at them,
1491980	1492980	I should cite them.
1492980	1496980	It's called invisibilia, that's the name of the podcast.
1496980	1501980	At the top of the podcast, they say, by the way,
1501980	1504980	we've discovered a fifth emotional state,
1504980	1507980	and so it's called ugut or something like that,
1507980	1508980	and we'll get to that later.
1508980	1513980	Like they found a tribe of people that feel, can feel a fifth thing.
1513980	1516980	I know it sounds absurd, but they have to create some stuff.
1516980	1517980	The Jackson family.
1521980	1524980	But, yeah, that fifth one is called germane.
1527980	1532980	Bring up my fancy mind map.
1535980	1536980	See?
1536980	1537980	We just talked about that.
1540980	1541980	Let's go to Twitter, shall we?
1541980	1543980	Yeah.
1543980	1544980	With a quick stop.
1547980	1548980	When we were doing a...
1556980	1559980	Which mind map is iron man?
1559980	1563980	Iron man going to the Twitter on the line map.
1565980	1566980	Loop.
1566980	1568980	I got a perfect loop.
1568980	1570980	I got a perfect loop.
1570980	1573980	I, I nailed this loop this time.
1574980	1576980	We'll get back to that later.
1577980	1578980	I just wanted to nail it.
1578980	1581980	I, it was just like, it was like a bike that stole me.
1581980	1582980	Like I, I...
1582980	1583980	When we were doing Soundcheck earlier,
1583980	1586980	Dan plugged this thing in to make sure the audio and video was working.
1586980	1589980	And he went, okay, everybody, a quick porn check.
1589980	1591980	He had to make sure that he wasn't going to turn his computer on.
1591980	1595980	And just, you all get bombarded with mannequin porn or whatever.
1595980	1596980	All right. Who's this guy?
1596980	1598980	Blind Melanade.
1598980	1603980	Can you fix Dan's mic at super low and then the music blows my speakers up?
1603980	1605980	I assume that person's...
1605980	1609980	Every week we get people that say the sound's way too low.
1609980	1612980	And I wonder if they just have broken sound.
1614980	1616980	I'll, I'll be back later.
1617980	1619980	I have a show to do.
1625980	1626980	All right.
1626980	1629980	Uh, could you please just say fuck Patrick O'Leary?
1629980	1631980	I guess I accidentally just did.
1632980	1634980	Is that a senator? I hope it's a senator.
1635980	1638980	A survivalism question I like to ask folks says,
1638980	1643980	Johnny Collins, whose Twitter name is silver tin time music.
1643980	1645980	I feel Spencer may have some good ideas.
1645980	1647980	Sorry for the mini manifesto.
1647980	1648980	Wait, you can't.
1648980	1649980	What's this guy's name?
1651980	1652980	Oh, good.
1652980	1653980	Oh, God.
1653980	1655980	What if, I feel like we're in porn country.
1655980	1657980	Like we're going to see my porn any minute now.
1658980	1659980	He said, he said, I don't know.
1659980	1660980	Johnny Collins.
1660980	1663980	A survivalism question I like to ask folks.
1663980	1664980	Okay. So I don't know.
1664980	1665980	It's when I click...
1665980	1666980	Just cut to the bottom.
1666980	1667980	I click on those images.
1667980	1668980	Oh, Jesus.
1668980	1670980	And then, and then it starts to go haywire.
1670980	1671980	I really need you to just tweet.
1671980	1673980	Just tweet, will you people?
1673980	1676980	You can't just don't tweet a, don't tweet a link to a thing.
1676980	1678980	You're going to end up that it's going to,
1678980	1680980	you're going to find out what I jerk off to so fast.
1681980	1684980	What if you had a guest right now would be in the chamber
1684980	1686980	and you're pouring windows right now.
1686980	1689980	What would we see if we came across it by accident?
1690980	1694980	Do you want me to tell people the thing I'm worried they'll know?
1696980	1698980	Yeah. Describe it for us.
1698980	1701980	You have to take the power away from them, man.
1701980	1705980	It's probably just hoverboard cut ventures or whatever, right?
1705980	1708980	By the way, worry, worry is not a feeling.
1708980	1709980	No, it's not.
1709980	1715980	It would be unpleasant for one split second of my bookmarks
1715980	1719980	to haunt me for 40 years of potential political career.
1719980	1722980	On a scale of one to 10, how offensive do you think it would be?
1722980	1724980	Like on a scale of like, like not that offensive?
1724980	1726980	I think there's some hot buttons.
1726980	1729980	I think that we're not a sexually progressive community.
1729980	1733980	I think that, I think that we all have little places that we go.
1733980	1735980	It's incest. It must be.
1736980	1739980	It doesn't make sense if this were like clown porn or something.
1739980	1741980	That would be a weird speech.
1741980	1744980	But remember Riley Reed said incest is best.
1744980	1748980	She said incest is like way, way up on the Pornhub searches.
1748980	1753980	And because we're all, because anything that you could think of that's taboo,
1753980	1757980	it's like, but I see these arguments online where people go like, oh, it's like,
1757980	1759980	and you can't, there's no heroes or villains in these stories,
1759980	1762980	but if you're, this is what the internet is doing to all of us.
1762980	1767980	It's like creating lack of context that is incredibly damaging to us.
1767980	1771980	Like, I've asked it before, and I wish we could like,
1771980	1775980	I wish we had like a love connection, like private kind of polling ability,
1775980	1779980	which I've said years ago, so that we could actually ask the folks that come to these shows
1779980	1783980	things that they can answer honestly without any fear that they're,
1783980	1788980	without having to clap when we say who here wants to fuck a dog, you know.
1788980	1790980	Like, that they can just.
1794980	1798980	But I do want to know kind of from millennials and then compare that,
1798980	1802980	like a kind of Kenzie investigation, like Kenzie.
1802980	1807980	Like, I want to know, like our millennial cousins, like,
1807980	1814980	are they, like, are they more or less like taboo in the bedroom?
1814980	1820980	Like, are they, are they, I mean, one person can yell out more, it's Annie in the front.
1820980	1824980	But, I mean, I know that there's no answer for one generation,
1824980	1829980	but then, but you want to aggregate that data and compare it to people 20 years older
1829980	1832980	and go like, and I don't know how you'd measure it,
1832980	1835980	but I'm just really curious about that sometimes because I,
1835980	1838980	my relationship with Cody, I don't think she'd mind me saying,
1838980	1843980	it's, we're very, like, we go to dark places, like, and we do a lot of characters
1843980	1849980	and there's a lot of narrative work that goes into, and it happens.
1849980	1853980	Do you guys ever do accents, like different dialects and things like that?
1853980	1858980	Like, are you ever like Count Dracula or some shit?
1858980	1860980	No, but I was.
1860980	1863980	Do you guys ever, do you ever do table reads?
1863980	1864980	What's that?
1864980	1866980	Do you ever table read some of your best stuff?
1866980	1867980	What, sorry, what?
1867980	1868980	Do you ever do table reads as some of your best things?
1868980	1869980	Table reads, that's right.
1869980	1871980	Sorry, I made you repeat your joke nine times.
1871980	1875980	No, it wasn't worth repeating any of those times, I would say.
1875980	1878980	Uh, can you return Rob Schraub's text please?
1878980	1880980	Answer the question, have you ever done an accent?
1880980	1881980	Have you ever played, like, a foreign character?
1881980	1889980	No, I mean, I guess the closest would be I was recently pretty, pretty high ranking Catholic.
1889980	1892980	So I probably have a lot of Italian friends.
1892980	1895980	On that Popo shit, or that page.
1895980	1898980	Did you do, did you do, like, an Italian accent?
1898980	1900980	No, no, I'm just, I was just making a joke.
1900980	1903980	Because your Fred Stoller impression was pretty good last week, I thought that was pretty good.
1903980	1906980	You should roleplay as Fred Stoller, that would be amazing.
1906980	1909980	This person says the stream keeps cutting out, and they said that 22 minutes ago,
1909980	1914980	but I think it's possible they might be experiencing, we're not starting the show yet, I don't know.
1914980	1916980	Not to be a dick, but the stream keeps cutting out.
1916980	1918980	They might have slow internet.
1918980	1920980	Who's alive tonight?
1921980	1923980	America, why aren't you up on stage yet?
1923980	1928980	Okay, see, that's, that's, that's, he's eating carrots.
1928980	1932980	When will you, fuck it, I'm eating some carrots, it wouldn't have killed you to return my text.
1938980	1943980	Wait, Rob is trolling us from outer space right now?
1943980	1947980	Please say this, please say this is a million from Rob Schraub.
1947980	1951980	I'll look at it, I'll, you know what, his texts are just, no, here's the thing,
1951980	1956980	when Rob's a fucking asshole, he, every Thursday we're supposed to hang out.
1956980	1957980	We have it on our schedules.
1957980	1962980	We're old men, like we know it, we're busy, so we only hang out if we schedule it.
1962980	1966980	So we schedule it every Thursday, Harmon and Schraub hang out.
1966980	1975980	So then he goes, I go, I go, you know, we were going to try to catch up on Twin Peaks,
1975980	1983980	like, because I have showtime and he's cheap, like, and I was like, hey, what about Twin Peaks?
1983980	1985980	He goes, I thought you canceled tonight.
1985980	1987980	I said, when did you think that?
1987980	1989980	He says, I got an email saying tonight is canceled.
1989980	1990980	I'm like, what?
1990980	1994980	And he sends me a screen grab that's clearly, he's just confused.
1994980	1998980	It's like one of those auto emails that get sent because Levy's schedules are hangouts.
1998980	2002980	And it says, updated invitation, weekly Schraub hang.
2002980	2007980	And it's for the following week because I'm going out of town for Cody's mom's birthday.
2007980	2012980	So he sends it, and this is the biggest dick move, even for Schraub.
2012980	2019980	He sends that, and you can tell he just saw it as he sends it so that he sees the dates were for next week.
2019980	2027980	And then he says, I got this too, but I couldn't decipher it.
2027980	2028980	He's, you see what I'm saying?
2028980	2030980	He said, I thought you canceled tonight.
2030980	2031980	I'm like, what?
2031980	2033980	And he's like, how about this?
2033980	2037980	And he looks at it, that too.
2037980	2038980	But there's no first thing.
2038980	2040980	He's just a fucking idiot.
2040980	2042980	And I said, all right, whatever.
2042980	2043980	I'll play video games.
2043980	2046980	And he said, AG's coming over if you want to come here.
2046980	2048980	And I said, that email is about next week.
2048980	2053980	And when you noticed that, you said, I also got this, but I never saw an email canceling tonight.
2053980	2057980	And Schraub said, I deleted it already.
2057980	2059980	Then another text, just come over.
2059980	2063980	Then finally a third text, I made a mistake.
2063980	2065980	Too late.
2065980	2070980	Then a fourth text, where are you with four question marks?
2070980	2073980	I won is what that means.
2073980	2075980	And then AG and I have our pants off.
2075980	2077980	Like, whatever, you know?
2077980	2079980	Like, yeah.
2079980	2085980	Yeah, well, he's just trying to be, you know, he's trying to make me miss him by being fun, you know?
2085980	2087980	AG, you want to come up here?
2087980	2089980	It's team AG!
2099980	2102980	We had our shirts off, not our pants.
2102980	2103980	Did you have fun?
2103980	2107980	Because I felt like, I just started playing video games.
2107980	2110980	You watched Mulholland Drive.
2111980	2118980	I said, we're supposed to watch Fire Walk with me because, you know, that's what David Lynch recommends.
2118980	2123980	If you're going to watch anything to catch up before you start watching Twin Peaks, watch Fire Walk with me.
2123980	2127980	And I said to Schraub, so should we watch Fire Walk with me first?
2127980	2131980	And he was like, maybe he wouldn't want me saying that.
2131980	2133980	He's like, Fire Walk with me sucks ass.
2133980	2137980	And I was like, so what does that have to do with anything?
2137980	2141980	So every week, should we get together and watch Citizen Kane and then Cheers?
2141980	2142980	What the fuck?
2142980	2145980	Like, I thought the point was to watch Twin Peaks.
2145980	2147980	David Lynch said, watch Fire Walk with me.
2147980	2149980	Fucking do it right, you dick.
2149980	2151980	Just sick of his bullshit right now.
2151980	2153980	And he fucked up.
2153980	2156980	You gotta read what he's writing to you.
2156980	2158980	What's he writing?
2158980	2160980	Yeah, Dan, read a couple of those.
2160980	2162980	I really want you to watch Fire Walk with me.
2162980	2166980	It would be a very good thing to do if you're going to watch...
2167980	2169980	I mean, Schraub saying, what Schraub tweeted,
2169980	2172980	will you get me tickets to write said Fred?
2172980	2174980	He's rhyming, he's rhyming.
2174980	2176980	Will you put toast on my...
2176980	2177980	He's rhyming.
2177980	2179980	Will you come visit me on my deathbed?
2179980	2181980	That was probably the first rhyme.
2181980	2184980	How do you like them apples? He hashtagged how.
2189980	2193980	Are you and Rob Schraub friends in real life?
2193980	2196980	He's funny when he's not here, it's amazing.
2196980	2197980	How come I...
2197980	2201980	At least you know you're getting $5 of Rob's money every month.
2201980	2205980	Who is Dark Man, he's asking now.
2205980	2209980	Why can't you start on time, says Derek, Tuesday sandwich.
2209980	2211980	Who is Dark Man?
2211980	2214980	It's Liam Neeson, isn't it?
2214980	2219980	Doesn't matter if your face is bandages on it.
2219980	2220980	Remember that impression?
2220980	2222980	Oh, yeah.
2222980	2226980	All right, well, TweetDeck, I'm having a little problem.
2226980	2229980	If anybody can recommend an app that functions like TweetDeck,
2229980	2231980	what's in my pocket, Schraub is asking.
2231980	2233980	Dan, do you think that in role-playing with Cody,
2233980	2235980	that you could get away and it would still be sexy
2235980	2237980	if you were Liam Neeson during the role-play?
2237980	2239980	Yeah, everything's sexy.
2239980	2241980	Everything's sexy when you trust someone
2241980	2243980	and you can go anywhere you want.
2243980	2245980	Can I give you guys assignments, like homework?
2245980	2248980	We suggest characters for you guys
2248980	2250980	and you come back next week and see if you guys can?
2250980	2251980	Scene studies.
2253980	2256980	Oh, I saw somebody had a question about Legs Lavish,
2256980	2258980	my YouTube channel that I watch,
2258980	2263980	which is about women for women reviewing hosiery.
2263980	2265980	But I lost it.
2265980	2266980	For women, you say?
2266980	2267980	Yeah, you can tell.
2267980	2271980	It's just women doing hosiery reviews.
2271980	2274980	It's not pornography.
2274980	2276980	All right, I mean...
2276980	2279980	Are you excited for the Mummy remake?
2280980	2284980	You know, they're trying to start up the dark universe.
2284980	2287980	Oh, is that like Universal Monsters?
2287980	2288980	They want it to be like Marvel.
2288980	2291980	Yeah, like Dracula and the werewolf team.
2291980	2292980	Oh, that reminds me.
2292980	2293980	I gotta check my...
2293980	2294980	To fight Imhotep.
2294980	2296980	I gotta check my Marvel Academy.
2300980	2301980	What the fuck?
2301980	2306980	I go away for five weeks and the show turns to shit.
2306980	2308980	Brandon, what did you let happen up here?
2308980	2312980	I said, we should do whatever you were going to do in your basement.
2312980	2315980	And now this is the running order of the show.
2315980	2316980	We make loops.
2316980	2318980	We play video games.
2318980	2320980	Dan's doing what he would normally do.
2320980	2321980	He's reading tweets.
2321980	2323980	He's playing video games.
2323980	2325980	I never read the dialogue.
2325980	2329980	We're like a month away from you actually just jerking off on stage.
2332980	2333980	Wait, what'd you say?
2333980	2334980	Sorry.
2336980	2337980	I'm sorry.
2337980	2340980	I've never seen somebody give the look of why wait a month.
2341980	2342980	One look.
2342980	2343980	Why wait a month?
2348980	2349980	Are you someone playing cookie collector?
2349980	2351980	What do you guys want to do later?
2353980	2355980	I guess we lost audio at some point.
2355980	2357980	We also lost the show.
2359980	2360980	Nothing happening.
2360980	2364980	It's just a rich 45-year-old just playing video games on stage.
2365980	2366980	Oh, I'm so glad you're back.
2366980	2367980	He doesn't care.
2367980	2369980	He doesn't know that we're here anymore.
2369980	2371980	He can either see nor hear us.
2371980	2374980	Well, don't you think people tweeting questions is part of a show?
2374980	2377980	I mean, I'm sorry I took a two-minute break today.
2377980	2378980	It is now.
2378980	2380980	To check on my Marvel Avengers characters.
2380980	2384980	I mean, it's a game.
2384980	2386980	What about AG's new movie?
2387980	2389980	Yeah, my movie.
2390980	2392980	My movie.
2392980	2395980	The star of Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
2395980	2396980	Yeah, my movie.
2397980	2398980	AG.
2399980	2400980	Thank you.
2400980	2401980	What is...
2401980	2402980	What's Findom?
2403980	2406980	Findom's where you hire a woman to have all your money.
2406980	2407980	Oh.
2407980	2409980	So is it possible this person is a...
2409980	2413980	Well, his Twitter name is Steven in debt.
2413980	2415980	Yeah, that's his fetish.
2415980	2417980	Dan, I'm worried my fetish is going to ruin my life.
2417980	2421980	Any thoughts, advice for beating an addiction to Findom and similar fets?
2421980	2424980	Findom seems like a stupid fetish.
2425980	2428980	I mean, but you know that that's...
2428980	2431980	There's a lot of stupid fetishes.
2431980	2434980	Yeah, but what if that made you cum?
2434980	2436980	What if giving someone all your money made you cum?
2436980	2437980	That's what he's saying.
2437980	2438980	I'd be like, that's dumb.
2438980	2442980	He obviously knows that, and so he's crying out for help.
2442980	2446980	Even if he's doing a bit, like, this person exists hypothetically.
2446980	2447980	Right, no.
2447980	2448980	I think I'd be a lot more...
2448980	2450980	If that were my fetish, I'd be a lot more productive.
2450980	2453980	Because, you know, you give all your money away, I've got to get back to work.
2453980	2454980	Yeah, you eventually run out.
2454980	2455980	I want to cum again.
2455980	2457980	I've got to go out there and make that money.
2457980	2458980	Yeah.
2458980	2463980	I would suggest to the person with absolutely no judgment at all, I would say, like, you
2463980	2473980	know, do what you would do if you were locked in a room, you know, and you couldn't live...
2473980	2477980	Like quitting smoking, you know, like, if you were locked in a room without your cigarettes,
2477980	2478980	you wouldn't die.
2478980	2479980	So I guess you just got to figure out a way.
2479980	2480980	You have to take an action.
2480980	2484980	You've got to really handcuff yourself to a radiator, werewolf style.
2484980	2488980	And it's never going to be the right time to do it.
2488980	2492980	Like, I got off the elliptical and I'm never going to get back on until I just do it at
2492980	2493980	the wrong time.
2493980	2501980	You've got to tell those young ladies on your chat window, no, you cannot have my money,
2501980	2503980	and I refuse to talk about it.
2503980	2504980	And even give it back.
2504980	2505980	Here's a pitch.
2505980	2507980	We bring your elliptical to the show.
2507980	2509980	You do 20 minutes of the show on the elliptical.
2509980	2510980	That's a great idea.
2510980	2512980	That's not a great idea.
2512980	2517980	Spencer, you guys don't understand what it involves to move that elliptical places.
2517980	2519980	Spencer's going to be the one moving that.
2519980	2520980	Yeah.
2520980	2521980	All right.
2521980	2522980	Well, so anyway...
2522980	2525980	I'll buy a new elliptical to have here so we can watch it work out.
2525980	2527980	There's an idea.
2527980	2528980	Let's see.
2528980	2531980	I mean, look, I mean, I'm not the one that...
2531980	2533980	I'm happy to talk about lots of stuff.
2533980	2534980	I got some movie recommends.
2534980	2537980	I don't feel at home in this world anymore and check it out on Netflix.
2537980	2538980	Oh, that's good.
2538980	2541980	What is this thing, all these branches going off of...
2541980	2542980	It's a mind map.
2542980	2544980	This app's called iThoughts.
2544980	2546980	I'm not sold on it right away, but...
2546980	2547980	Also, watch Sneakers.
2547980	2548980	It's a 90s movie.
2548980	2549980	It'll make you feel...
2549980	2552980	It'll make you feel better...
2552980	2553980	No, it won't.
2553980	2554980	It'll make you feel sad.
2554980	2558980	Well, because there's no internet yet, but it's about hacking and it's fun.
2558980	2560980	And there's a Russian guy in it that's like,
2560980	2563980	oh, it's crazy that the Cold War is over and you just want to kill yourself.
2563980	2564980	Did you watch the...
2564980	2565980	And River Phoenix is in it.
2565980	2566980	Yeah.
2566980	2567980	So here's the thing.
2567980	2568980	I was watching it.
2568980	2573980	I was like, goddamn, you know, all due respect to everyone in Tinseltown.
2573980	2579980	I hope this isn't ghoulish, but for real, after River Phoenix died,
2579980	2582980	you know DiCaprio's agent called him...
2582980	2584980	Called DiCaprio and was like, River Phoenix died.
2584980	2587980	And DiCaprio was like, oh, bummer.
2587980	2589980	What do you got for me?
2592980	2594980	So what do you think, Gilbert Grape?
2594980	2597980	It's like, you know, come on, man.
2597980	2601980	River Phoenix dying was good for DiCaprio is my thesis.
2601980	2604980	Yeah, I'm sure the agents were thinking that for sure.
2604980	2606980	Do you think DiCaprio murdered him?
2606980	2607980	No, I wouldn't go that far.
2607980	2611980	I just think, you know, it's weird when life puts you sometimes in the position
2611980	2613980	of cheering someone's death.
2613980	2616980	Did you see The Keepers?
2616980	2618980	Yes, I've been watching The Keepers.
2618980	2620980	It's a bummer.
2620980	2622980	No, I mean, it's insane.
2622980	2623980	It's crazy.
2624980	2626980	We've stood up here numerous times.
2626980	2628980	We all hate the kids.
2628980	2630980	We particularly hate the teenagers.
2630980	2632980	We think they're entitled.
2632980	2634980	We were...
2634980	2639980	Dino and I were in the back of a lift, and there was a crossing guard.
2639980	2641980	There were kids going across the crosswalk,
2641980	2645980	and then somehow the lift driver ended up...
2645980	2648980	By mistake, he ended up...
2648980	2650980	His car was blocking the crosswalk.
2650980	2653980	It wasn't because he wasn't looking and plowing to kids.
2653980	2656980	It was because of the ebb and flow of crosswalking this.
2656980	2660980	He ends up stuck at a stop sign, and he's in the middle of the crosswalk.
2660980	2665980	This 10-year-old kid comes up to the backseat window of the lift
2665980	2668980	and knocks on the window that Dino's at
2668980	2672980	and just has this adorable smile on his face.
2672980	2674980	But he's being a cock.
2674980	2676980	Dino rolls down his window and goes,
2676980	2679980	can I help you? He's like, can I help you?
2679980	2681980	Whoa!
2681980	2686980	Luckily, he got Dino and not me, because I'd be in jail right now.
2686980	2688980	I don't know what I would have said.
2688980	2691980	I probably would have escalated, but Dino was like,
2691980	2695980	you can walk around a car. I believe in you.
2695980	2698980	And he's like, I shouldn't have to.
2698980	2701980	And he's like, you can do it. Good boy, good boy.
2701980	2704980	And you hear him in the distance go, don't call me boy.
2704980	2707980	He was Indian, by the way.
2707980	2710980	Well, don't bury the lead, then.
2710980	2712980	Just to make sure you know.
2712980	2715980	Fucking Indian children, wow.
2715980	2717980	They can't use crosswalks.
2717980	2719980	I'm including that at the end, because Dino said boy,
2719980	2722980	and he said don't call me boy, which is like...
2722980	2725980	His race became important at that point, in my opinion,
2725980	2727980	because it's like, wait a minute, what?
2727980	2730980	Fucking shithead. Fucking shithead.
2730980	2732980	So that's how we feel about kids. We don't like them.
2733980	2735980	We like those kids, though.
2735980	2738980	Because we grow up to be those kids.
2738980	2741980	That little smart mouth motherfucker was great.
2741980	2744980	He had a running bit already on the street
2744980	2747980	that he was willing to fuck with adults on.
2747980	2749980	He's a future Dan Harmon.
2749980	2751980	Well, I hope so.
2751980	2754980	But I have a feeling that he's a future Donald Trump,
2754980	2758980	because he's like, oh, a system exists by which I can just yell at people,
2758980	2760980	it's illegal to hit me.
2761980	2763980	I think I'll just wag my dick around.
2763980	2765980	Bling, bling, bling, bling.
2765980	2767980	But here's the thing.
2767980	2770980	This was all a downbeat to something uplifting about this.
2770980	2771980	We all shake our canes.
2771980	2772980	These kids, they suck.
2772980	2774980	They're so fucking shitty.
2774980	2776980	They know it's illegal to hit them now,
2776980	2778980	and they're just taking advantage of it.
2778980	2781980	If you watch The Keepers on Netflix,
2781980	2784980	it's like this nun disappears, they find her body,
2784980	2786980	and then it all starts to uncork.
2786980	2790980	This horribleness is happening within the Catholic high school.
2790980	2793980	And it's just like episode after episode,
2793980	2795980	story after story of you can't believe.
2795980	2797980	It sounds like a parallel dimension,
2797980	2800980	the shit that people were getting away with abusing these kids.
2800980	2804980	These kids were pubescent girls in an all-girls Catholic school,
2804980	2809980	and I was uplifted, and I was talking to somebody about this the other day,
2809980	2813980	because they were griping about today's kids, you know, like, oh.
2813980	2818980	And I was like, yeah, but if these kids, like, that Keepers shit,
2818980	2819980	it's impossible now.
2819980	2828980	Like, today's 13-year-old isn't going to go into a priest's office
2828980	2831980	and believe they should just drink a soda
2831980	2834980	and talk about what a slut they are
2834980	2836980	and not think it's going to, you know,
2836980	2839980	that entitlement that we're complaining about and stuff,
2839980	2842980	it's like, where did the obedience get us?
2842980	2845980	Where did the respect for elders, like, it's just like,
2845980	2848980	it's always six to one and a half a dozen, like,
2848980	2852980	when you watch the Keepers, you just wish Ariana Grande fans
2852980	2855980	would run into the office and go like, I'm entitled,
2855980	2857980	because it would be the end of everything.
2857980	2860980	And instead, this thing goes on and on for so long
2860980	2862980	that you're just watching old people
2862980	2866980	watch the snow fall over the footprints of their abuse that took,
2866980	2867980	that was so severe.
2867980	2871980	It took them their entire life before they could even remember it,
2871980	2874980	then talk about it, then find each other on Facebook,
2874980	2877980	then be told by everyone, go fuck yourself,
2877980	2879980	you took too long to remember it.
2879980	2882980	Anyways, so the good old days weren't that good.
2882980	2887980	It is, by the way, a tenet of fascism from everybody that studies it,
2887980	2892980	these allusions to a mysterious, amorphous, uncited golden age.
2892980	2894980	Make America great again.
2894980	2897980	But, oh, everything was great at some point.
2897980	2899980	You'll never be able to get out of a fascist
2899980	2903980	the actual documentation of when it was so fucking great.
2903980	2907980	They love to talk about, like, it's like comic book golden age or something,
2907980	2910980	like, oh, remember when things, yeah, remember when you were six
2910980	2912980	and you thought fucking Santa was real?
2912980	2913980	That's what you're talking about.
2913980	2915980	You want to get back to when you were six?
2915980	2920980	Fucking bloated windbag, shitty, murderous, horrible.
2921980	2924980	I didn't... Yeah.
2924980	2927980	And by the way, politically, let's check in on my politics.
2927980	2929980	Ask me where I'm at politically.
2929980	2930980	Dan?
2930980	2933980	Politics corner!
2936980	2938980	I'm back to every man for himself. I hate everybody.
2938980	2940980	Sorry if that's demoralizing.
2940980	2944980	That's been Politics Corner brought to you by Gold Bond Foot Powder.
2944980	2947980	Gold Bond. It's powder for your feet.
2947980	2949980	I'll swing back.
2949980	2954980	But don't... I'm currently... I'm just in this mood currently.
2954980	2957980	I don't believe in liberalism. I don't believe in Democrats.
2957980	2960980	I'm back to one of those douchebags that's standing on the sidelines going,
2960980	2962980	fuck you, but it's just... I'm just thinking...
2962980	2966980	I'm like, I just can't... I just feel like it just...
2966980	2969980	Come on, everyone's fucking dumb. Everyone's dumb.
2969980	2971980	We know everyone's dumb. The average IQ is 100.
2971980	2974980	85% of every group of anyone is a fucking moron
2974980	2976980	that can't make a decision for themselves.
2976980	2978980	They say the dumbest shit.
2978980	2981980	We're just... the species has run its course
2981980	2984980	and we've got to get to the moon or I've got to get out of here.
2984980	2986980	I've got to dig a hole in the desert, just go down.
2986980	2988980	What happened to the moon?
2988980	2991980	We dropped that premise after episode three, I think.
2991980	2993980	Right.
2993980	2996980	Church and I went to the March for Truth in L.A. yesterday
2996980	2999980	and we were leaving the march.
2999980	3002980	There's always six or eight pro-Trump people on a corner,
3002980	3004980	usually completely surrounded by police,
3004980	3006980	but you're not even allowed to get close to them
3006980	3008980	because they're afraid of what might happen.
3008980	3011980	But yesterday, for some reason, you could walk up to them.
3011980	3013980	They had like a microphone and a speaker
3013980	3015980	and there was a guy dressed like...
3015980	3018980	Homeless Ben Franklin.
3018980	3021980	He had like the old Knickerbocker plus four...
3021980	3023980	Wait, so he wanted you to connect those dots,
3023980	3025980	like the American Dream now is homeless?
3025980	3027980	He had a little beat-up tricorn hat
3027980	3030980	and he looked like Homeless Ben Franklin.
3030980	3031980	And he was like, everyone wants to talk.
3031980	3033980	You can come up, liberals yell at us,
3033980	3035980	but you can come over and talk to us.
3035980	3041980	A penny stolen is a penny stolen.
3041980	3043980	Homeless Ben Franklin jokes.
3043980	3045980	Is that what he was doing?
3045980	3047980	There was Make America Great Again banners
3047980	3048980	and there was a lot of...
3048980	3052980	Why would I have a key? I don't have a house.
3052980	3055980	If I tried to discover...
3059980	3061980	But I know we're derailing you,
3061980	3064980	but are you sure this guy was conservative?
3064980	3065980	Yeah, he was.
3065980	3066980	But he was being pretty cool
3066980	3068980	because he was engaging people.
3068980	3070980	If you want to come up here, I'll give you the microphone.
3070980	3071980	We can have a discussion.
3071980	3072980	Okay.
3072980	3074980	It turns out mostly they shout you down
3074980	3076980	about what you think
3076980	3078980	because they're surrounded by lock her up
3078980	3082980	and Hillary is evil posters.
3082980	3084980	They're still on that thing.
3084980	3086980	But Church at the center, this is amazing.
3086980	3088980	I should probably talk about it like she wants to,
3088980	3090980	but she had this conversation with this woman
3090980	3093980	who had an American Indian drum
3093980	3097980	and she had a Trump Pence 2020 shirt and hat on,
3097980	3099980	but she didn't vote for Trump,
3099980	3101980	but she thinks that it was better.
3101980	3104980	But Church and I were having this hour-long conversation with her
3104980	3105980	that she came away with.
3105980	3107980	It was really uplifting.
3107980	3110980	But surrounded by people that can actually talk,
3110980	3112980	and one of the upshots of it was the woman said,
3112980	3113980	you know what?
3113980	3115980	This conversation makes me feel like I should call up
3115980	3117980	some of my friends that I don't talk to anymore
3117980	3118980	because I don't feel like I can
3118980	3119980	because we're so different,
3119980	3121980	the gulf between what I believe and what you believe
3121980	3123980	is so unbridgeable.
3123980	3125980	But there was another guy pacing around
3125980	3127980	and he had goggles on
3127980	3130980	and an American flag bandana and a helmet
3130980	3134980	and military flak jacket kind of stuff on
3134980	3135980	and carrying a flag
3135980	3137980	and just pacing around mad dogging everybody,
3137980	3139980	clearly looking for a fight.
3139980	3141980	So you have people that really do want to have a discussion,
3141980	3144980	surrounded by people that are clearly cruising for a bruising.
3144980	3145980	Yeah.
3145980	3149980	The guy in Portland, he was just this...
3149980	3152980	And there was this one kid, college-age looking dude,
3152980	3153980	and he had a big sign that said,
3153980	3155980	stop the hate, let's debate.
3155980	3157980	I walked by him and said, hey, you want to just talk?
3157980	3159980	I'm like, not really.
3159980	3163980	It's hot out, so I want to go have lunch.
3163980	3167980	And I'm pretty sure we're not going to convince each other of anything.
3167980	3169980	And he's like, no, I just feel like
3169980	3171980	it shouldn't be about shouting to you a conversation.
3171980	3173980	We should be able to talk about the difference.
3173980	3174980	I totally agree with that.
3174980	3177980	I appreciate you guys being out here and doing that.
3177980	3178980	Hurray for you.
3178980	3181980	Then I saw him a little later on while Church was having her talk,
3181980	3182980	and he held his sign up,
3182980	3185980	and underneath his stop the hate, let's debate sign.
3185980	3189980	I will post this photo because he's a douchebag.
3189980	3192980	When he lifted his thing up, his shirt said,
3192980	3195980	Hillary sucks, not like Monica, though, or something like that.
3195980	3196980	I'm like, oh, really?
3196980	3198980	So I went up and said, hey, can I get a picture of you?
3198980	3199980	And he goes, yeah, and he holds his sign up.
3199980	3202980	I wanted to get a picture of your awesome misogyny shirt.
3202980	3203980	And he goes, what?
3203980	3206980	I go, I love that underneath your stop the hate sign,
3206980	3208980	and you proudly admit you hate women.
3208980	3211980	He goes, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
3211980	3212980	Charlie Callis?
3212980	3214980	Yes, yes, yes.
3214980	3219980	Oh, good to see the high-roaded party of the emotional left
3219980	3221980	is so sensitive to my needs.
3221980	3222980	Oh, good.
3222980	3223980	They showed you true colors.
3223980	3225980	I'm so fucking sick of that.
3225980	3229980	Like, these people are not going to reward our fucking, like,
3229980	3230980	we're the trolls now.
3230980	3232980	We should be angry, and they should go fuck themselves.
3233980	3236980	I hate that they, like, switched gears to this, like,
3236980	3237980	they're trolling us.
3237980	3240980	Like, they don't really want to.
3240980	3242980	I like that there was a gang of people out there going,
3242980	3244980	no hate, let's debate.
3244980	3247980	Because what I think that means is that they're on the fucking ropes
3247980	3251980	psychologically, just them, that they've run out of ways
3251980	3253980	to feel like they're part of a group.
3253980	3257980	And now they're so lonely, and people have gotten so good
3257980	3261980	at walking by them that they're like, what about discourse?
3263980	3266980	Okay.
3266980	3268980	You guys always want to talk, right?
3268980	3271980	Intellectual, let's have a conversation.
3271980	3273980	Okay, what are you saying?
3273980	3275980	Every time.
3275980	3278980	I just, like, these people are dumb.
3278980	3281980	They're dumb, and you know they're dumb when they speak
3281980	3284980	because they don't know how to put thoughts together.
3284980	3289980	And when you say things to them like, that sounds like you don't know
3289980	3294980	that America isn't two million years old, they say,
3294980	3298980	see, it's that kind of attitude that's seen its day.
3298980	3302980	You know, like, it's an anti-intellectual revolution.
3302980	3304980	So there is no conversation.
3304980	3310980	They're ugly, mean, nasty, brutish, thuggish, selfish.
3310980	3311980	I got a boo-boo.
3311980	3312980	It's everyone else's problem.
3312980	3315980	People, I got a fucking boo-boo, motherfucker.
3315980	3317980	I pay taxes.
3317980	3318980	I pay everyone's taxes.
3318980	3321980	I'm a one percenter.
3321980	3323980	It's hard for me.
3323980	3328980	Get out the world's biggest violin for me.
3328980	3329980	You're paying for it.
3329980	3330980	Yeah.
3330980	3333980	Your tax dollars go to tiny violins all over the world.
3333980	3335980	It's just like, Louis CK had this thing where he was like,
3335980	3339980	by the way, voting is like, it's not, you're not supposed to wait
3339980	3343980	for the candidate that's like, you know, like, oh, you know,
3343980	3344980	that's what we're suffering from.
3344980	3346980	I think I was reading this thing by Noam Chomsky,
3346980	3348980	but like most things by Chomsky, I probably didn't understand it
3348980	3351980	if I read it five more times, but we're talking about this thing
3351980	3356980	about individualism also being, okay, it's this bag of potatoes principle
3356980	3362980	where individualism, like hyperbole, where it's like you kind of count
3362980	3365980	on the impoverished, you play up to everything that divides them,
3365980	3369980	even down to the individual, not just racially, not just religiously
3369980	3372980	and gender and all that stuff, but also you kind of encourage this sort
3372980	3376980	of like, oh, democracy means that you as an individual should be able
3376980	3379980	to put your feet up and eat potato chips, and if anything gets in your way,
3379980	3381980	you should be able to complain about it.
3381980	3387980	And that's a weapon that conservatives use to make stupid people go,
3387980	3391980	wait, oh, the air conditioning changed a little bit?
3391980	3394980	It's 9-11!
3394980	3399980	It's 9-11!
3399980	3402980	Yeah, it was good that I got cut off there.
3402980	3405980	It's 9-11, which is where we've decided to take an act break in our show.
3405980	3410980	Yeah, we're going to use that now as an organic time to stop and take an act break
3410980	3415980	and announce the fact that we are now officially going to start our D&D campaign,
3415980	3421980	our Pathfinder campaign.
3421980	3425980	But, we kind of did that in the wrong order.
3426980	3429980	The 9-11 is a reminder that we go to a word from our sponsor
3429980	3431980	for people who listen to the podcast for free.
3431980	3434980	Okay, do you guys know what Fulton and Roark is?
3434980	3436980	A full mitt Roark?
3436980	3441980	Fulton and Roark is a premier men's toiletry service
3441980	3447980	that specializes in wax-based cologne and body wash for men.
3447980	3451980	Well, now you're confusing people because what we're going to do is take an act break
3451980	3455980	that the feral audio people could identify where they would put the volume down
3455980	3458980	and play one of those mid-roll ads.
3458980	3461980	Oh, I thought we were telling the audience the ads.
3461980	3463980	That was the special treat.
3463980	3466980	It's 9-12 now. Did that ship sail?
3466980	3469980	So, here's what we're going to do.
3469980	3472980	It's 9-11, so we're going to take a break here
3472980	3475980	during which the people who listen to the podcast for free
3475980	3478980	are going to listen to a pre-rolled ad.
3478980	3482980	During that ad that you're listening to at home for free
3482980	3486980	or on your subway or where you're cutting your carrots in the front lawn,
3486980	3490980	the people that are here live and the people that pay $5 a month
3490980	3494980	are going to experience an exclusive Harman Town experience.
3494980	3498980	It's called a solid gold blowjob machine.
3502980	3506980	So, right now, already we're going to take a break
3506980	3512980	so, right now, already, the people that can hear the sound of my voice right now,
3512980	3516980	if you didn't pay for this, there's going to be a mistake.
3516980	3520980	Because you're now in the ad free zone.
3520980	3523980	The exclusive...
3523980	3526980	So roomy. Luxurious.
3526980	3530980	I know. It's so comfortable. It's like wearing me undies.
3530980	3535980	We should monetize the ad free zone if it becomes...
3535980	3541980	But also, it's a great time to show pictures or play some songs.
3541980	3545980	Yeah, write a song for us, Dan.
3545980	3549980	Alright.
3549980	3553980	See, this one still needs work.
3561980	3565980	What if you slow it down?
3565980	3569980	Like, considerably.
3569980	3573980	Try to request for a suggestion.
3573980	3577980	And I'm just talking about the whole music making process.
3577980	3581980	Are you about to do a slow jam for us?
3581980	3585980	Just imagine those podcast fuckers missing out on this.
3585980	3589980	Are we in the ad free zone or are we back? I hope so.
3589980	3593980	It's nice, right? It's a little more manageable.
3593980	3597980	He's right.
3597980	3601980	Dan doesn't like it.
3601980	3605980	This one is getting more depressing.
3605980	3609980	Sounds like graduation music. Yeah, that vitamin C song.
3609980	3613980	Jeff Brian Davis.
3613980	3617980	Did you guys... I don't want to sound
3617980	3621980	defensive or tyrannical, but did you guys
3621980	3625980	have been complaining the whole time about how the show's going and what's happening
3625980	3629980	and the show have anything for the people that could be special?
3629980	3633980	Did you want to share anything with anybody?
3633980	3637980	What did you do while you were there? Yeah, where were you, Jeff?
3637980	3641980	I traveled all over the country with Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops,
3641980	3645980	Jill Murray, and Bob Durkach. We did comedy for people.
3645980	3649980	It was very fun. Whose life anyway? It's a good show.
3649980	3653980	Did you say sarcastically, good thing nobody's missing that?
3653980	3657980	Yeah, you know, I didn't go anywhere last week at all.
3657980	3661980	Yes, you did. You went to some sort of Pathfinder affair.
3661980	3665980	No, no, I was hunting whales.
3665980	3669980	Did you catch any? Yeah, I murdered three and
3669980	3673980	as life was being squeezed out of their supple necks,
3673980	3677980	I was just imagining them as all the fans.
3677980	3681980	It was a podcast just murdering the fans.
3681980	3685980	I didn't even know whales had necks. Oh, they do.
3685980	3689980	They're hard to strangle, but it's the hardest way to kill a whale.
3689980	3693980	You have to hate whales so much. We were doing it for sport, of course.
3693980	3697980	It's easy to hate whales when you think of them as your fans.
3697980	3701980	You could kill a whale with a harpoon or with a bomb, but you have to fucking hate whales
3701980	3705980	to get in the water with them and just try to strangle them.
3705980	3709980	Interpol, because of all this conflict ivory that we had on board,
3709980	3713980	is a real situation.
3713980	3717980	Yeah, you're giving poachers a bad name. You're one of those bad poachers.
3717980	3721980	Yeah, yeah. I talked our way out of it. I floated the head Interpol guy
3721980	3725980	a dress made of puppies. Yes!
3725980	3729980	And he led me off with a warning.
3729980	3733980	And we're back.
3733980	3737980	That is some insane recall right there. Wow.
3737980	3741980	That was amazing.
3741980	3745980	I wish people could hear.
3745980	3749980	You guys missed something. If you don't pay five bucks a month,
3749980	3753980	there's callbacks to other shows that happen.
3753980	3757980	Let's all put our pants back on and get back in the show.
3757980	3761980	That was chilling.
3761980	3765980	Like us getting into the D&D thing.
3765980	3769980	So we're not going to do actual gameplay this episode.
3769980	3773980	That's going to be the next episode.
3773980	3777980	Hold on.
3777980	3781980	One thing we're going to establish about the D&D thing is we're going to do it earlier in the show.
3781980	3785980	About halfway through. So we're hopefully a little more sober.
3785980	3789980	We're going to keep it consistent.
3789980	3793980	We're looking at how to spiral out of control.
3793980	3797980	We're just going to have people that are always
3797980	3801980	able to do the show doing the characters
3801980	3805980	and we're not going to start doing the rotating guests and all that stuff.
3805980	3809980	Spencer is going to always call the shots. We have to respect his authority
3809980	3813980	as Dungeon Master both in terms of
3813980	3817980	out of game and in game.
3817980	3821980	That's why I now hand it over to you
3821980	3825980	to explain what we're doing this week.
3825980	3829980	You should have played that graduation music.
3829980	3833980	We're gathered here today.
3833980	3837980	We have your characters. I have your character sheets.
3837980	3841980	I thought we should talk about your backgrounds and come up with your shared backstory
3841980	3845980	as kind of like a fun exercise so that when we start
3845980	3849980	we'll kind of have some sense of your history together.
3849980	3853980	Does that make sense? Dan, what is your character's racing class?
3853980	3857980	It's a great question. It's like a quiz. I have to know
3857980	3861980	it now. You haven't thought about your character?
3861980	3865980	I haven't thought about this in a while. We kept pushing it off. Spencer and I, we just got
3865980	3869980	my character together. I know what my spells are. No, you're very proactive.
3869980	3873980	You're a human cleric. I'm a human cleric, you dick.
3873980	3877980	I did forget it. What's your character's name?
3877980	3881980	Is that blank so far? No, that's part of what we've got to
3881980	3885980	come up with. I'm going to let that sit
3885980	3889980	because can I see my sheet?
3889980	3893980	No, there's nothing. This is what we're trying to figure out.
3893980	3897980	I should have showed you guys these earlier when we weren't on stage, but you seemed
3897980	3901980	busy.
3901980	3905980	Steve? Oh yeah, because we're going to do
3905980	3909980	We've got to bring Levy up. Get a little Levy sitting down there on the floor.
3909980	3913980	Levy, get up here. Steve Levy!
3917980	3921980	More like a rivy.
3921980	3925980	Finally, more dudes on the stage.
3925980	3929980	So here's the thing about that.
3929980	3933980	We're going to have to just take that bullet.
3933980	3937980	I'm not going to be one of these guys that says, hey, you've got a hundred million
3937980	3941980	dollar movie. Take it easy. Equality achieved. However,
3941980	3945980	I will say that because we want to be able to
3945980	3949980	have consistency, it's like
3949980	3953980	for the D&D, it is going to be...
3953980	3957980	I had a wife and I lost her.
3957980	3961980	We'll continue to...
3961980	3965980	Plus, I looked into it. It turns out girls are actually bad
3965980	3969980	at D&D.
3969980	3973980	I looked it up. I saw it online.
3973980	3977980	You've got to send your angry letters
3977980	3981980	to the show.
3981980	3985980	We're not going to circulate through special guests.
3985980	3989980	We're not going to circulate through special guests,
3989980	3993980	which means that if we're starting with a sausage party, it's going to be
3993980	3997980	a consistent sausage party every time we play D&D. The show is largely sausage party.
3997980	4001980	But can women not join the game if they've already played it?
4001980	4005980	Do the cast stay together from birth?
4005980	4009980	Brandon, you just broke Dan Herman.
4009980	4013980	The game that we're going to play,
4013980	4017980	our D&D campaign started to fall apart because it started to become
4017980	4021980	inconsistent.
4021980	4025980	Yeah, we would have Curtis Armstrong two out of ten times.
4025980	4029980	It was all Kumail Kumail.
4029980	4033980	So we have to force ourselves to have a ribcage
4033980	4037980	where we know there's people
4037980	4041980	who are more likely to be here every single episode.
4041980	4045980	And if one of them is gone, we'll make a judgment call on whether
4045980	4049980	they vanish for that episode or go into another room
4049980	4053980	or Spencer plays them, or if we just take that episode off.
4053980	4057980	So that there can be consistency of character.
4057980	4061980	We're moving it up earlier in the show so that we'll be a little
4061980	4065980	hair more towards sober and that's one of the things.
4065980	4069980	What was the question?
4069980	4073980	Could we get more dudes on stage?
4073980	4077980	No, the question was how do you integrate a woman?
4077980	4081980	No, that's not the question.
4081980	4085980	Because the answer is you start bringing strangers up on stage every week
4085980	4089980	and what I'm trying to explain is that we have to take a hit on gender
4089980	4093980	equality and all that stuff in the interest of a solid D&D campaign because
4093980	4097980	we don't, we're not, we- That's what they said about baseball.
4101980	4105980	And now we have our own
4105980	4109980	postage stamps.
4109980	4113980	It looks like we made it.
4113980	4117980	You guys got a hundred million dollar movie.
4117980	4121980	What are you talking about? Wonder Woman, it's like a record breaking thing.
4121980	4125980	Is a hundred million dollars good?
4125980	4129980	Yeah, yes. Good, great. Yeah, that's good for a movie
4129980	4133980	to make it its first weekend. Damn, what's your fucking character's name?
4133980	4137980	That was the question. I'm not telling you yet.
4139980	4143980	No, that's my character's name.
4143980	4147980	You're a human cleric, you said? You're a human cleric.
4147980	4151980	And you guys are in service of the Church of the Silver Flame.
4151980	4155980	What's your character's name? Chad the Fire Liker.
4159980	4163980	Do you know your character's name? I haven't really thought about it.
4163980	4167980	Well, this is the time.
4167980	4171980	I announced I was going to come back and we were going to play D&D and you guys don't even have names for your characters.
4172980	4176980	You announced we were going to play D&D, you left us.
4176980	4180980	Yeah, because this show doesn't pay.
4180980	4184980	You announced we were leaving the meltdown, we had to just find the castle.
4184980	4188980	Yeah, you changed the locks at the comic book store, we couldn't even find you.
4188980	4192980	I missed you guys, I get excited about our new campaign.
4192980	4195980	I know, but... I picked my spells, I got the whole shit picked up.
4195980	4199980	I picked you spells. No, it's not true.
4200980	4203980	We consulted about that.
4203980	4209980	Is there a middle gear between passionate, zealously,
4209980	4215980	I'm so dedicated to us doing this particular thing right now, and you totally fucking leaving the show?
4215980	4219980	Just you coming back and just being like, oh, I'm back, it's good to be back.
4219980	4222980	It's okay, Dan forgot he was a human cleric.
4222980	4225980	Dan is right, Jeff.
4226980	4228980	Fuck you, Brandon.
4228980	4232980	You're like Ulysses, he comes back, he's like, who's trying to fuck my wife?
4232980	4234980	And then he just kills everybody.
4234980	4238980	You know, one of those guys, one of those guys Ulysses killed was just like, he thought,
4238980	4242980	I was like, I was told you were dead, I came to propose to your wife, I didn't touch her,
4242980	4246980	participating in an arrow shooting contest, now I'm dead.
4246980	4251980	I've been away, maybe I'm overcompensating by my absence and I felt remiss,
4251980	4255980	and so I thought a little bit about what spells I have.
4255980	4258980	They're mostly fire because I'm Chad the Fire Liker.
4260980	4263980	I'm a gnome druid, by the way.
4263980	4267980	Why do I always play small characters? Because I'm tall?
4267980	4269980	I can't remember in this instance.
4269980	4272980	Oh, because you like the drawing I did.
4272980	4274980	Oh, that's right.
4274980	4280980	Was the idea of this segment that you just want us to tell you stuff about our characters?
4280980	4285980	Well, I mean, I really thought it would be quick to come up with the names and we'd move on.
4289980	4291980	You're a cleric, so what kind of stuff are you into?
4291980	4293980	Like, what's your alignment?
4293980	4296980	Or even just what's your name?
4297980	4299980	No need to complicate it.
4299980	4302980	I think your name should be Chad also.
4302980	4306980	I was just going to say, Chad the Fire Hater.
4307980	4309980	Chadrick. My name's Chadrick.
4309980	4310980	That's not a good idea.
4310980	4312980	And then Steve will be with me.
4312980	4314980	The Fire Lover.
4315980	4318980	Yeah, I mean, Carlos.
4321980	4322980	Carlos.
4322980	4324980	I like it.
4324980	4325980	I love it.
4325980	4326980	Carlos.
4326980	4327980	Carlos.
4327980	4328980	Johnson.
4329980	4330980	Carlos Johnson.
4330980	4332980	What a funny name, Johnson.
4332980	4334980	Yeah, where'd you get that?
4334980	4337980	Carlos Johnson the Unimaginative.
4340980	4341980	Perfect.
4341980	4342980	Great.
4342980	4345980	So you're a healer, magic user kind of guy?
4345980	4346980	He's a cleric.
4346980	4347980	I'm a holy man.
4347980	4348980	I'm a cleric.
4348980	4349980	Yeah.
4349980	4351980	And so what's your relationship to the...
4351980	4353980	Well, what's Steve?
4353980	4356980	I've been thinking about it while on stage.
4356980	4360980	And I was in Dan's office for a phone call the other day.
4360980	4361980	Right.
4361980	4364980	I was on his window board.
4364980	4365980	You know what I'm talking about?
4365980	4367980	I might.
4367980	4371980	They're the words Diarrhea Jr.
4374980	4376980	And I was really...
4376980	4377980	Of course.
4377980	4381980	It's my curiosity and I think that should be my name.
4381980	4383980	Maybe DJ for short.
4383980	4384980	Oh, that's great.
4384980	4386980	DJ, that's great.
4392980	4393980	Okay.
4393980	4394980	That's good.
4394980	4396980	This role playing game is playing itself.
4396980	4397980	Yeah.
4397980	4402980	So now we got to come up with your characters, high concepts and your great weaknesses.
4402980	4405980	So, I mean, concepts are already kind of come up.
4405980	4407980	You're a pyromaniac gnome.
4407980	4410980	You usually come up with your concept because yours is generic.
4410980	4413980	And, Steve, you're kind of like a...
4413980	4416980	A person who can give people diarrhea.
4416980	4418980	Is that his special power?
4418980	4419980	I mean, I think his power is...
4419980	4422980	He has to stay out of pools for 14 days.
4426980	4429980	DJ the no pool swimmer.
4429980	4433980	His weakness is he has to drink a lot of Pedialyte all the time.
4433980	4436980	Well, he can't resist it.
4436980	4438980	And your flaws.
4438980	4441980	If you came up with a concept, come up with a flaw.
4441980	4445980	So the concept, does that translate into game terms?
4446980	4451980	No, it's just like, I mean, if you're pitching Jeff Winger, you're all like, you know, out of work.
4451980	4452980	Well, I don't know.
4452980	4453980	Okay.
4453980	4454980	But like that.
4454980	4455980	But for your character.
4455980	4456980	Okay, got it, got it.
4456980	4457980	And you didn't have anything in mind for him?
4457980	4458980	No, because I don't know.
4458980	4459980	I only know what Jeff's going to be.
4459980	4462980	And Steve said he was kind of basing his off Link from Zelda.
4462980	4464980	So that's kind of his concept.
4464980	4465980	But you don't really have one.
4465980	4471980	Well, I think I'd like to be an overzealous, I mean, that's judging the character.
4471980	4476980	But he's a zealot.
4476980	4477980	He's a zealot.
4477980	4478980	He's a zealot.
4478980	4479980	I think you'd call him.
4479980	4488980	Like one of those Westboro Baptists.
4488980	4493980	Yeah, like somebody that's like a cult leader in the making.
4493980	4498980	Like somebody that's so zealous that it's really more about their ego.
4498980	4504980	Like a genuine zealot who actually has a fucking like problem.
4504980	4507980	Like they found meaning in this religion.
4507980	4510980	And if it weren't for this religion, they'd be so fucked up.
4510980	4512980	It's unspeakable.
4512980	4516980	So they're hooked on it and can't like, like, like, so, you know,
4516980	4521980	maybe this person is like Christopher Eccleston in the leftovers.
4521980	4522980	Oh, I haven't seen it.
4522980	4527980	But yeah, like I would say I would assume maybe like my characters like has a problem.
4527980	4530980	Like they're a sociopath, you know, like Richard Spencer.
4530980	4531980	Did you ever see that?
4531980	4532980	Yeah.
4532980	4535980	There's so many shitty people with Spencer in their name.
4535980	4536980	It sucks.
4536980	4540980	Did you ever see that 1992 YouTube video?
4540980	4542980	It's 28 minutes long called Child of Rage.
4542980	4544980	It's this little girl she keeps going.
4544980	4547980	And there's an offscreen therapist that keeps going like,
4547980	4549980	and what would you like to do to your little brother?
4549980	4550980	Pick him with pins.
4550980	4554980	Like she's like because she was adopted and she was found like in a crib
4554980	4557980	and her own piss and stuff and she like she said she didn't know love
4557980	4560980	and didn't doesn't know how to process it.
4560980	4565980	So she like like like there's something wrong with this guy that then he found
4565980	4568980	like his religion.
4568980	4569980	Right.
4569980	4572980	He's not and it really has like given him meaning and direction,
4572980	4576980	but he doesn't it hasn't helped him grow to the extent that if he were to ever
4576980	4579980	say he needs this religion to really keep him together.
4579980	4580980	Right.
4580980	4584980	I like that so much.
4584980	4585980	Religious fanatic.
4585980	4588980	It's like when you meet when you meet somebody that you're like,
4588980	4592980	oh man, you're super dedicated to being a nerd because if you weren't a nerd,
4592980	4594980	if you somebody actually gave you Iron Man armor,
4594980	4598980	the first thing you do is step on innocent people's heads because you're so angry.
4598980	4602980	But like like but not like I don't think this guy has rage issues as much as I
4602980	4605980	think he like actually doesn't know right from wrong.
4605980	4608980	And so he's relieved to feel that.
4608980	4609980	Yeah.
4609980	4610980	I like it.
4610980	4611980	So all right.
4611980	4612980	Come up with Steve.
4612980	4613980	Do you have anything yet?
4613980	4615980	Come up with weaknesses if you haven't yet.
4615980	4616980	Think about that.
4616980	4617980	Steve.
4617980	4618980	Do you have anything for concept?
4618980	4619980	What's what's what's diarrhea?
4619980	4621980	Junior's race in class again.
4621980	4623980	He's an elf or half elf.
4623980	4626980	He's a he's an elf fighter.
4626980	4630980	I think that my guy's my guy's weakness would be susceptibility to like kind of
4630980	4635980	charm like kind of things because if he's like he's he doesn't have he's a
4635980	4636980	follower.
4636980	4637980	Well, he doesn't.
4637980	4644980	He's if you can break through his force field of of of of social programming
4644980	4650980	that he like yeah anybody that had a that was in the business of making people
4650980	4654980	think things or illusion magic or stuff like that that he'd be a little more
4654980	4658980	susceptible maybe to have a penalty against that because he's like kind of
4658980	4661980	he's yeah is that is that a good weakness.
4661980	4662980	It's okay.
4662980	4668980	Maybe he's a guy who hopes his weaknesses are up to snuff.
4668980	4670980	He's really insecure about it.
4670980	4673980	No, but what do you can you then you have extreme not allergies.
4673980	4676980	Can you can you can you work?
4676980	4677980	Can you help me here?
4677980	4679980	I don't I'm not I'm not jazzed about that.
4679980	4682980	It's hard to say because the the only thing is I think this kind of what I
4682980	4685980	told Jeff a little bit it would be better if they weren't part of your character
4685980	4686980	concept.
4686980	4689980	So it's like that's kind of a natural consequence of your concept.
4689980	4692980	So this would be a more lateral weakness.
4692980	4698980	You know like he also he he you know he he has a bad ever turns right.
4698980	4699980	Yeah.
4699980	4700980	Okay.
4700980	4701980	Right.
4701980	4702980	Okay.
4702980	4703980	Polio.
4703980	4704980	Sure.
4704980	4705980	Could be polio.
4705980	4713980	Do you get wheeled around or something?
4713980	4718980	My dad survived the polio epidemic in the fifties and so he has like a
4718980	4719980	withered leg.
4719980	4720980	My dad.
4720980	4724980	So I grew up with a very masculine dad who walked with a masculine limp.
4724980	4728980	But when he wears shorts he has like this little toothpick leg.
4728980	4729980	This is in real life.
4729980	4730980	This is real life.
4730980	4731980	I just thought so.
4731980	4732980	Just clarify.
4732980	4734980	I'm Carlos the unimaginative.
4734980	4738980	I write what I know.
4738980	4743980	So I was like maybe I maybe I maybe I have like I literally have a physical
4743980	4745980	limitation like polio.
4745980	4746980	Sure.
4746980	4752980	Like I have like I like I had I survived a disease that left me permanently
4752980	4760980	capable.
4760980	4762980	This day is next weekend.
4762980	4765980	The choices you're making right now will stick with you for a long time.
4765980	4769980	You know I'm trying to yeah I mean go big or go home right.
4769980	4772980	I mean he's a cleric so I figured you know like he's yeah like like I don't
4772980	4773980	know.
4773980	4775980	Is that does that is that I can keep.
4775980	4776980	That's fine.
4776980	4778980	But I mean I will say that we do live in a world.
4778980	4779980	I mean we don't.
4779980	4780980	But your movement is important.
4780980	4781980	Well no.
4781980	4784980	Where magic can heal death even.
4784980	4786980	So like a leg.
4786980	4787980	Boy howdy.
4787980	4788980	Can that be healed.
4788980	4789980	Well what.
4789980	4792980	Well what about like you know like.
4792980	4795980	That doesn't mean he can't be you know.
4795980	4799980	Doctor Strange the guy that's like he he's playing basketball and it's like oh
4799980	4804980	actually I'm supposed to be totally fucking immobile but I went to like what if what if
4804980	4806980	he what if he did.
4806980	4811980	He is healed with magic but he has like there's magic keeping him kind of without it.
4811980	4814980	Oh so he's like wearing a magic brace.
4814980	4815980	Yeah.
4815980	4816980	OK.
4816980	4817980	Or I like that a lot.
4817980	4820980	Or he has to constantly drink some kind of potion or something that he's basically addicted
4820980	4821980	to.
4821980	4822980	All right.
4822980	4823980	Cool.
4823980	4824980	Yeah.
4824980	4825980	Well that'll slot into great.
4825980	4826980	OK.
4827980	4828980	Steve.
4828980	4830980	You have anything.
4830980	4833980	No Steve A.G.A. a minute.
4833980	4838980	I'm still thinking about homeless Ben Franklin.
4838980	4839980	All right.
4839980	4840980	No I'm not leaving though.
4840980	4843980	Oh sorry.
4843980	4844980	Can you help me out.
4844980	4845980	What it would.
4845980	4847980	What's a normal kind of weakness.
4847980	4851980	Well what's your character concept.
4851980	4854980	The mute swordsman from far away.
4854980	4856980	That's her character concept.
4856980	4857980	OK.
4857980	4860980	Not completely mute but you don't talk much.
4860980	4864980	Look if you're open to pitches I think you know you're nervous right now because the
4864980	4867980	reason you're nervous and lethargic is because you don't want to fuck this up.
4867980	4870980	The reason you don't want to fuck it up is because you want to be really good when we
4870980	4871980	play D&D in the podcast.
4871980	4872980	I do want to be good.
4872980	4877980	You're going to be you're you're you should you should really like I think you should
4877980	4880980	be if you should be yourself.
4880980	4883980	I think you should be like like really enthusiastic.
4883980	4886980	All right.
4886980	4887980	That's his weakness.
4887980	4889980	That's a terrible weakness.
4889980	4890980	Like what is his character.
4890980	4891980	What is your character.
4891980	4892980	What is your.
4892980	4893980	I'm a half elf.
4893980	4894980	Just elf.
4894980	4896980	I'm an elf swordsman right.
4896980	4897980	Yep fighter.
4897980	4898980	So is it.
4898980	4899980	So is it.
4899980	4900980	Fire swordsman.
4900980	4901980	And we're writing his history.
4901980	4902980	We don't know his history.
4902980	4903980	Fire.
4903980	4904980	What.
4904980	4905980	Are we writing his history.
4905980	4906980	A little bit.
4906980	4907980	I mean we're about to now.
4907980	4908980	Could he.
4908980	4909980	Once we get his weakness.
4909980	4910980	But we can move on.
4910980	4911980	Could he be kind of a.
4911980	4912980	In the cold be weak.
4912980	4913980	My weakness.
4913980	4916980	The cold is everyone's weakness in a way that cold is one week.
4916980	4919980	Then we're going to be playing and you're going to we're going to want your leaving
4919980	4920980	is happening.
4920980	4921980	I think he should be.
4921980	4926980	Can't your prom just be that you're like leaving that he's like that he's like erstwhile.
4926980	4927980	He's like a squire.
4927980	4932980	You know he was like assigned to this church because it looks like you're like you're this
4932980	4933980	guy.
4933980	4937980	Like you're always telling me that you love me and stuff and I should eat better and I'm
4937980	4938980	like yeah.
4938980	4939980	Go fuck yourself.
4939980	4940980	It's a huge week.
4940980	4941980	Yeah.
4941980	4942980	Yeah.
4942980	4943980	His weakness.
4943980	4948380	He's like like like like he's a caretaker to the point of extremism like he he worries
4948380	4951980	more about other people than he should probably care more about him crippled by his naivete.
4951980	4953740	He's an anxious warrior.
4953740	4954740	That might be true.
4954740	4955740	You have an ideology.
4955740	4959660	There's you actually think that that a happy ending is possible for this species and it's
4959660	4960660	sad.
4960660	4961660	Sometimes.
4961660	4962660	OK.
4962660	4965100	That's true.
4965100	4974980	And Jeff you're afraid of the dark right.
4974980	4982460	Why couldn't you go first terrified of the dark because my my character is it's not unrelated
4982460	4986340	or maybe it's maybe it's partially related because I was raised.
4986340	4993300	I got captured when I was like a little druid gnome and held by demons like underground
4993540	4998940	and I prayed to like the silver flame gods and like actually conjured fire.
4998940	5003820	And so like I use like fire as kind of a crutch because I'm afraid of terrified of the dark.
5003820	5004820	Right.
5004820	5005820	Does it.
5005820	5006820	OK.
5006820	5007820	Yeah.
5007820	5008820	So I'm like also kind of a germaphobe.
5008820	5012580	Do you think it's your friend because I want to make sure my character balances with yours
5012580	5017620	but I'm thinking more about my like like like could I be like this like whatever my thing
5017620	5022860	is that has me like I'm I'm sort of a self flagellating kind of character figuratively
5022860	5029660	or literally where I'm like oh pain is important and you have to you know it's like like I'm
5029660	5037620	actually suspicious you know like like like like like like like like 20 percent dinklage
5037620	5046700	in Game of Thrones at 10 percent rocket raccoon and then like 40 percent I guess me.
5046700	5049180	But then like I can't remember the percentages and how they added up.
5049180	5050660	I think you're at 70.
5050660	5051660	OK.
5051820	5056340	But but like somebody that's like kind of like like like oh they they figure like you
5056340	5061700	you're supposed to like they can't they can't accept a good fortune and yeah yeah they can't
5061700	5067900	accept joy like me they want to they want it's those people that like whip themselves
5067900	5068900	literally.
5068900	5069900	Yeah.
5069900	5070900	Yeah.
5070900	5071900	Yeah.
5071900	5072900	Yeah.
5072900	5073900	Yeah.
5073900	5074900	Yeah.
5074900	5075900	Yeah.
5075900	5076900	Yeah.
5076900	5077900	Yeah.
5077900	5078900	Yeah.
5078900	5079900	Cool.
5079900	5080900	All right.
5081140	5082140	I'm afraid of the dark.
5083980	5084980	All right.
5084980	5088060	So let's let's let's come up with your with your with your character story.
5088060	5092500	So everyone gets to come up with their own character background like where they started
5092500	5097180	their adventures like where do you guys get you know where you get your start.
5097180	5098180	You might not know.
5098180	5099420	Wait me.
5099420	5100420	All of you.
5100420	5103860	These are you know we're thinking about these in ways you mean backstory or where we're
5103860	5104860	getting back story.
5104860	5106380	So where did you get your start.
5106380	5107900	Like so for you you're a religious guy.
5107900	5111060	So it might be where you found religion and like joined the church or something.
5111060	5112060	Yeah.
5112060	5113060	I'm just riffing here.
5113060	5114060	But I.
5114060	5115060	Right.
5115060	5116060	Yeah.
5116060	5117060	We're all just.
5117060	5118060	Yeah.
5118060	5119060	Right.
5119060	5120060	We're making it up.
5120060	5121060	I'm just going to go from birth forward.
5121060	5123740	I think I was like one of those kids whose parents like like like prostituted them you
5123740	5132860	know like like like had done like but toddlers and tiaras kind of thing or but less first
5132860	5139580	world more low hash tax kind of prostitution like like like genuine genuine horrible abuse
5139580	5146340	at the hands of God just to just left to drift in a horrible society like like born in filth
5146340	5153580	and and then subject to the horrible in humanities and then developed a horrible like I like
5153580	5154580	this pain.
5154580	5155580	Yeah.
5155580	5158820	And then and then because of that maybe in my adolescent years we'll put a pin in it
5158820	5166660	but whatever that was it led to injury or disease so severe that I was finally broken
5166660	5172060	down and then found this so maybe somebody from this religion like like converted me
5172060	5176700	and then I started to become a cleric and like 19 or something and that and then so
5176700	5183180	so then and then but then within this church of the silver flame I I I'm like a zealot
5183180	5188820	that I because I'm not politically facile I'm always you know I'm not a threat to any
5188820	5194420	of the higher ups I'm like always good for being sent on a mission but it's like my only
5194420	5199980	problem is that I'm kind of like like I will like like like I need I'm not going to make
5199980	5205620	a good cardinal because I'll always question hypocrisy of the church itself so like I kind
5205620	5212460	of been like bounced around and like they'll still make me do weird shit if you can justify
5212540	5219540	it yeah so I so I wound up at this place because I maybe this is like I kind of in the outskirts
5219820	5225500	this place this this church yeah well I mean it's a big church it's like it covers the
5225500	5229260	whole country but I mean are we geographically going to start in a place that's like yeah
5229260	5234980	outskirts it okay yeah so maybe I've been transferred to that place recently because
5234980	5241700	of a recent like dust up I had with a superior where I called them out on their religious
5241700	5246580	democracy sent to the outskirts yeah great that's how you got your start either of you
5246580	5253580	guys have anything Steve looks like he's going for something I got something so my my my
5256780	5263780	village when I was a kid was burned to the ground I love it and my my parents were murdered
5264780	5271780	but the church took me in but the thing that I don't know is that it was the church that
5273220	5279380	murdered my entire village including my parents okay I don't think the crowd likes that you
5279380	5286380	should change your story no that's good all right great Jeff yeah I think that like like
5287940	5292900	I said I feel like like I was kind of born in captivity right and you're in darkness
5292900	5297260	by demons in darkness surrounded by demons who are like and all there was was like the
5297260	5301700	only light was like flaming torches and my the rest of my family were just like super
5301700	5308700	religious very docile druids who didn't believe in violence they were so pure and I didn't
5309340	5313820	want to like just die in there like I watched all my family die inside this like these wooden
5313820	5319660	cages inside this like darkness and I thought the only way to get out is I like I heard
5319660	5324540	your family dying yeah I heard them die right well you get it there's a little flickering
5324540	5329220	of flame you can see him fall over there could be a twist in season three where we reveal
5329220	5336220	in flashback oh no it was yeah that was a sock but then like I like because they were
5337420	5343340	so docile they didn't like ever use like their their their druidic powers like there's no
5343340	5348020	nature in there to really summon because we're just like we're so underground and hidden
5348100	5354100	that I like I think I like communed with like the silver flame you know who's the spirit
5354100	5359220	that you call to the spirit of the silver flame right I called to that and I was given
5359220	5364940	this kind of extra violent power of fire and I ended up just burning my way out and kind
5364940	5368820	of like so I'm like I like I'm using like it seems like an anti nature thing did like
5368820	5374340	to want to set things on fire but that was how I got out and so I'm just kind of I think
5374340	5377900	I'm a little guilt-ridden about the fact that I have more of a violent tendency than I wish
5377900	5383700	I did so I try to use it like my flames to purify things and purify myself I like it
5383700	5389140	I'm sorry I almost started crying to that story I like that there's a theme of darkness
5389140	5396140	like we don't just have like a person that eats marshmallows for breakfast and doesn't
5396420	5401580	know pain because they whatever they like we're all we're a little damaged this is a
5401580	5407340	very cultish dark like we fit into a theme that's good I like that yeah I think it's
5407340	5414580	very genre yeah so now we're gonna come up with how you guys met so Jeff is gonna come
5414580	5418180	up with how he met Steve Steve's gonna come up with how I met Dan and Dan's gonna come
5418180	5423460	up with how I met Jeff and then we'll do a second round of that so it's and and if you
5423460	5427660	forget it's the person to the right and then Dan you wrap around it Jeff and Steve briefly
5427660	5432140	you're an elf fighter and what briefly was your family died family died it was the church
5432140	5440620	but he doesn't know okay wait can I just because I just want to make so you the first
5440620	5446540	adventure isn't gonna be like how we met no well I mean this could be well what's the
5446540	5449420	first adventure in the future I just mean no no the one we're about to play when we
5449420	5454060	play it yeah no you'll have met each other at the very least like you'll you know we're
5454060	5458420	doing like modern TV we're not writing an origin pilot we're starting on episode seven
5458420	5462300	yeah well this would be the origin pilot that we're currently writing right now right
5462300	5467580	right and so we're not gonna start going hey how are you my name is Donald exactly it might
5467580	5472300	be like oh we're back in the same wagon but it's not like right oh who are you fucks yeah
5472300	5477540	I like that that's that's smart from a from a from a from a peak TV Steve how old are
5477540	5487500	you when you're when your family got killed probably elves are old too so whatever hundred
5487500	5495980	and six five or five five all right so my I met Steve when I when I when I burst out
5495980	5502780	of this cave elves live so long that when they're 70 they're like sucking on a pacifier
5502780	5509900	what's the point of living long if it when I came out of the darkness I was also like
5509900	5515940	five and I stumbled into him and he because he's an elephant a little more worldly and
5515940	5520300	a little more like you're a fighter right yeah I feel like he took pity on me and kind
5520300	5523780	of took me under his wing because I was just this little blinded mole person that had been
5523780	5528700	living in darkness and I'm terrified of the dark you guys and he kind of took me under
5528700	5533820	his wing and kind of looked after me and kind of got me on my feet he was like my kid brother
5533820	5542140	yeah you guys were temporary brothers yeah is that good enough sure I guess well I mean
5542140	5549820	yeah whoever has an idea so after my village was burned down I don't remember any of it
5549820	5555460	but that's you know the church adopted me and they raised me and that was my family
5555460	5562340	they're the best and Dan's character was my mentor and he took me under his wing and he's
5562340	5571260	like look see a lot of myself in you and make sure that you you know can run this church
5571260	5582500	later on right so I killed his parents no I'm kidding are you suggesting you guys are the same
5582500	5596420	age well no no we've known each other for let's say 20 years who me and you know me and us Steve
5596420	5601580	like we were children when we read but we kind of grew up together so like I could so could we
5601580	5605940	just make it simple and I'm kind of like a wit like a fucked-up like Dumbledore to you that like
5605940	5614140	yeah like I'm the we met at the tavern and I'm you're the priest from the keepers you did
5614140	5622380	unspeakable things to these kids teacher I'm a professor I mean not to be hacky like X many
5622380	5627740	about it or you know like like but like you recognize kind of nascent greatness in our in
5627740	5632580	our spirituality you kind of mentored us and to kind of raises and like focus our powers well I
5632580	5636220	think it's like almost like now and this is where we get into like don't you know whatever you
5636220	5640300	whatever you have in store for us is fine but like the thing that would be interesting was that it's
5640300	5645180	like it's kind of a suicide mission but I'm taking my favorite students with me and I don't mean like
5645180	5651620	I'm superior to you guys but I'm older than you and you were like like I'm a cleric at the church
5651620	5657780	of the silver flame you the path that brought you guys together then joined and led you to where I
5657780	5664020	have been for a while yeah and I was like trying to teach you guys to like meditate or whatever but
5664020	5669580	then like I got I got like action or something right in the timeline did you get sent to the
5669580	5674900	outskirts before you met did you get like you know edged out by the the church before you met them
5674900	5682660	or after but well I'll go either but well do you want me to pick no yeah yeah before because
5682660	5687460	because because I've been I've been actually in the outskirts for a while because it's like the
5687460	5692900	pachinko machine of society like brought me to like where I am where I'm like I just hang out I
5692900	5698300	make a paycheck I teach people to pray and like that pain is important so that sounds like you
5698300	5703660	connected and then you got sent away and kind of you're not in contact with them too I got like
5703740	5708620	like I like these guys like they I got a telegram that said you need to go get the orb of the thing
5708620	5714340	not to tell you your job but it should probably be an orb and I'm not saying this is our first
5714340	5718100	adventure because like I said we're starting episode seven but maybe the origin was that
5718100	5723060	this is what we're yeah well he said hey shithead like it's like I'm in the outskirts because I'm
5723060	5729460	always already a piece of shit and then they like just wanted to kill me and then I was allowed to
5729460	5736900	take like like people and they came with me and we maybe had success and so now we're kind of like
5736900	5741940	out there and we get like communiques and they go okay now go do this yeah I got this we've become
5741940	5745940	like black water for this church we're kind of working together to kind of regain favor maybe
5745940	5751700	you'll be together at the beginning like you'll be on a mission like together I'll come up with
5751700	5755780	exactly yeah so we're kind of like like maybe a little band of misfits that kind of not isn't
5755940	5759540	good graces with the church maybe because we're not pure enough and we're trying to like we're
5759540	5763860	trying to like prove ourselves yeah it would probably help to have a goal like how do we see
5763860	5768820	the future like I kind of like like like what do we think what do we hope the outcome of this well
5768820	5774100	the church of the silver flame exists to exercise and purify the world of evil so I don't know that
5774100	5777860	doesn't necessarily have to be your goal but that's kind of what the church exists for like
5777860	5783620	you know Christianity is like save all sinners like this is just kill all evil yeah I think like
5783700	5787860	it would be cool like if we're all kind of zealots in our own way but we're not very orthodox about
5787860	5792420	it like we're near your regulars we're rough around the edges but we're trying to I think my
5792420	5797460	religion my part of the silver flame I'm attracted to the idea of like people keep saying oh our job
5797460	5803460	is to purify uh by burning and like they don't focus on the filth that is the wood you have to
5803460	5809540	fucking be you have to have the pain and and like and you are setting it on fire like I like these
5809540	5814820	guys because they're nuts and bolts people that get results done and I don't I think that I've been
5814820	5823540	fired let's say from three shows I created I mean campaigns and like I'm out there and I'm going
5823540	5831300	like like my overall goal is I don't care if I die trying I mean I don't want to die but I want to
5831300	5840580	actually prove that politics and kissing ass and stuff is like that this this church the religion
5840580	5848660	is right right the the church is wrong I know that they they've got us out here wandering doing
5848660	5854740	missions because they can't wait for us to die I love it that we keep not dying so I'm a little
5854740	5858980	I'm like the dark version of Tom Hanks and Saving Private Ryan where I'm like like just fucking
5859700	5865780	don't let the German go but but but uh the the the where I'm like like like we're out there
5865780	5871460	and it's like I do I do believe in my zealous heart that one day we're gonna we're gonna
5872100	5877060	make headlines like like or we're gonna do their job for them yeah yeah we're a little renegade
5877060	5882100	we're going a little like we're we're we don't go through normal channels maybe but we all are
5882100	5887940	zealots in our own way but we do really believe like in some sort of like that we can rid the
5887940	5897700	world of evil awesome last last part okay so now you favorite color yeah um no you come up with
5897700	5903380	that one special thing about your character so I mean Dean you're already someone who's like
5903380	5908500	magically healthy that might be your thing but you could have a different thing but this is like
5908500	5916900	this is like a special special thing like a unique Mary Sue trait Mary Sue yeah let's move past it
5918660	5925140	what did you say wisdom basket or let's get past it let's move past it okay yeah yeah that's a good
5925140	5932820	idea but also what if you had a wisdom basket that should be the secret I thought he said
5932820	5941380	Elizabeth was the basket I have a I have a I have a wisdom basket that if I ever lose because it's
5941460	5947780	like it's like a self it's like a self-torturing thing where every all the pain I feel I collect
5947780	5953300	it that's I don't want to I don't want to connect all these dots this needs to be like lateral
5953300	5958420	like like like this is like a just a thing like a glass eye yeah like I said it is pretty
5958420	5963620	reasonably unique that like you have some sort of ailment that you're constantly fighting against
5963620	5967460	that again doesn't have to be it but that's a give me a give me a for instance about how specific you
5967460	5977780	want this to be um here's secretly a fairy Spencer can we get back to the game please and
5977780	5985860	stop attacking each other he's just he just asked a question just you don't have to get angry at
5985860	5991700	everyone you're you're you're the fastest gun gunslinger in the west or something you know
5992420	6001620	special thing photographic memory premature ejaculator yeah there you go just an example
6005700	6010020	that's a good one you guys go first let me think yeah I should have any suggestions
6012180	6021300	say what burns cover my body oh yeah so I'm just totally burned I don't think that's unique enough
6021940	6024980	huh that's not unique enough yeah I think a lot of people are burnt
6026260	6032740	you're so glad you're about to repeat it for you my asshole is one giant third degree burn
6032740	6038980	oh no that's horrifying it's like that piece like that part of the pizza that you try to eat around
6038980	6045060	because it's burnt what's happening but it's your butthole are you imagining it what's that pain
6045460	6048980	yeah I'm trying to thinking oh that's my story breaking I think I'm imagining
6050660	6057700	night terrors like oh that's a good one unique like I can't sleep around other people like I
6057700	6062500	might stab him that's not a unique okay oh it's not unique oh okay all right well this is helpful
6062500	6068580	right the most so unique that it's like like this is the one guy in all of midi in the yeah okay
6068580	6074820	and it might not be a talent but it's definitely something unique like uh okay all right what did
6074980	6080580	you say you got three balls is that what you said like you once stole the robe off the king's back
6080580	6088820	and he thanked you for it like that's unique that's all not unique
6092980	6095460	and he's just here to fucking hate on you the entire time
6098420	6104500	it's fine I accept it what if my dick was fireproof this is a gentleman in the front row
6104500	6107140	all right I thought this was supposed to be imaginary
6115220	6116580	unique like unique
6120980	6124580	that's the question was what if you could produce ice cream at will from your hands
6124580	6129540	oh oh man the answer is not unique enough that would be badass you'd have diabetes
6129540	6139140	you have a you have a quado I have a I have a pair of 3d glasses uh okay it's unique because
6139140	6147460	3d has not been invented right uh they're just useless a glass eye is is is more unique than
6147460	6152020	your body being covered with burns yeah you're the only person up to the uniquity of this world
6152020	6160100	what did you say sir zeppelins and then I I again only heard the word zeppelins because

6295380	6300820	that's the other thing of people's minds holy shit a leg brace being used as a weapon
6300820	6302260	that's never been done before
6304900	6309940	well yeah I think he's feeling I think he loves it I think we cut our I would have loved it before
6309940	6313620	I was told that all this other stuff wasn't unique enough and you're like your leg brace
6313620	6318180	can be used as a weapon no no it's like I mean like that's like a like a summer movie from the
6318180	6324100	90s okay how about this this might be a shitty pitch I have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead
6324100	6331780	and occasionally if I really focus I can see 45 seconds into the future that's still too powerful
6331780	6336260	that's too powerful yeah man you're making up a playable thing oh yeah well I mean just
6336260	6341700	the future I just have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead but this is a really interesting thing
6342100	6346020	people ask you something that makes you different from everyone on the planet
6348660	6349380	but okay
6354100	6354600	yes
6357220	6362020	how about this I have a tattoo of an eyeball on my forehead and I can see when my eyes are closed
6363060	6367780	yeah yeah that's fine there we go it looks like it's hands yes I can pretend like I'm sleeping
6367780	6371460	but I'm watching every motherfucker you can see when your eyes are closed yeah yeah
6373540	6377140	that's fair enough that's not too that's not too super power it's a bit of an advantage but I
6377140	6381780	think it's cool enough like it's not overpowered at all yeah like people like hey go to sleep I am
6381780	6389300	sleeping well but you answered the question brushing my teeth and fixing my hair
6392260	6396980	Levi you go yeah oh also we could move off this if you don't think it's no are you fucking
6397060	6400500	kidding me this is I'm just offering this is the reason why we play
6402740	6409540	vodka yeah oh but hang on I can amend mine a little bit uh to make it better the tattoo
6409540	6415300	of the eyeball my forehead it's a closed eye oh shit I don't know I think it's gonna be an
6415300	6420180	open eye it's gotta be an open eye yeah it's gonna be like a hand okay all right yeah okay
6420180	6423700	but it's kind of it's kind of poorly drawn so it doesn't even look like an eyeball really it's
6424420	6428660	like a poorly crafted yeah okay it's like a shitty like jail tattoo of an eyeball
6429700	6432340	because I got it done in the dark because I was raised in the dark
6434180	6440020	I'm trying to think of like what's unique about like you know like any of us like which is
6440020	6444260	interesting like like like like I think we don't we don't really want to have just a thing that
6444260	6448500	makes us totally different as much as we want to be really really really really good at one thing
6449380	6454660	uh you know that's what we fantasize about none of us really actually wants like a thing that makes
6454660	6459060	us absolutely different from everyone else as much as our stories pretend how about you're really
6459060	6464260	good at dividing up the tab when multiple people are like paying for dinner like you know exactly
6464260	6468660	who I was what yeah there's those things like like I remember I remember we had that like we
6468660	6472900	I was in Milwaukee and we talked and like one of the four people because someone asked at the table
6472900	6478340	what do you think you're better at than anybody else and I had some pretentious answer about
6478340	6483620	being able to write dialogue forever uh and uh but there was a guy who said I can count the number
6483620	6490260	of words in your sentence no matter how long it is right it was it was uh it was um uh uh joe uh
6490260	6494980	I can't know I can't remember his name from Madison Comedy Sports you know joe ocd no joe
6494980	6508260	cd joe cd joe cd joe cd joe chompson joe Madison Comedy Sports
6508820	6512260	I don't know if I know joe he all of a sudden he just goes yeah I can do that and I was like
6512260	6516100	fuck you you can't do that tell me how many words in this sentence he's like 17 and it was like
6516100	6521460	fuck fuck you and then for the rest of the night and he was like you know like you could tell that
6521460	6526420	he'd been living with it his whole life anyways all right right you could do that no no but it's
6526420	6530180	and it's like what if that would be a coin actually because I'd have to do that.
6530180	6536180	Pleat amnesia for five minutes every day but to the point where you don't even know what a human is
6536180	6542500	you don't know what your hand is the sun but for just five minutes oh yeah every five minutes you
6542500	6550500	go on a salvia trip all right you make that's what happens man it's scary you make a seven layer dip
6550500	6557700	that's to die for right like it's it's it's almost magically delicious how good your seven layer did
6557700	6565620	this but you're right that's a good one haunted by the voices of the people you can actually
6565620	6570980	hear them I can hear the voices of the people I've killed yeah you're haunted or maybe even
6570980	6575300	maybe even informed by them you know but you've never killed anybody
6580340	6585140	you're gonna find this out later what if I what if I'm what if I'm what if I'm what if I'm I
6585140	6591300	like that a lot I thought what if I'm haunted by the voices of people I'm liable I'm a I'm destined
6591300	6595540	to kill and that the whole now that's stupid it's like a fucking dumb like what am I what kind of
6595540	6599460	side that would be a reveal I think yeah because then I'm like oh I'm gonna make sure I don't kill
6599460	6603620	that person I just right okay well I mean well what do you know we're getting there about your
6603620	6607220	your heart's about the second there's another cleric in your church that makes eight layer
6607220	6615460	dip and you don't know what that eight what that eight layer is I hear I hear the voices of every
6615460	6623700	single person that I've ever killed great I love it does Steve have any oh sorry you look like
6623700	6627780	you're about to say something no it's just like therefore that's a reason why I'd rather not kill
6627780	6635540	people yeah and it keeps getting louder and louder yeah okay I like it yeah uh what if also the
6635540	6640980	longer you go without killing that that you've gone their voices start to fade but as soon as
6641060	6645780	you kill someone all those voices come back including the persons that you killed I like
6645780	6650500	that too yeah that will fuse us I like that because then I'm like then I then I have a very
6650500	6658420	disingenuous uh uh reason to be the guy that doesn't want to fight yeah yeah you know what
6658420	6665300	number one okay one more is not gonna gonna make a big difference I'll get back on my diet tomorrow
6665300	6672180	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I really like that it's like I'm a I'm eating souls or something
6672180	6676180	and yeah but also every time you kill another person you lose one layer out of your dip
6679540	6686100	until it's just sour cream at the end and then you die all right I fucking nailed it you guys go
6686100	6692820	uh so complicated it was a woman that I took the idea from
6696740	6704500	um I don't know Spencer what what ask a woman you have what what if what was that is it is it
6704500	6711300	right every time you masturbate I think is what she said not unique at all
6711940	6712420	yeah
6715460	6721140	in general or to me I use I I stopped ordering lubricant I know my tears can do it
6729940	6737060	I have uh an incredible sniper like accuracy when throwing any object too powerful okay you're
6737700	6747620	gambit yeah uh bullseye really good at bar games oh like like uh jizz acid also too powerful
6749620	6750900	Spanish Tourette's
6753380	6755460	and you even you don't understand what you're saying
6757540	6758900	that better be the episode title
6759700	6761700	uh
6763300	6765940	I wish I couldn't see that through I wish I could
6767380	6778180	uh yeah fintom fintom what that's actually really I like that you you're you you you you get
6778180	6786180	turned on by by by being financially exploited by a woman is that what that means that's what I
6786180	6790260	heard yeah I mean that's what I learned yeah they get these ladies and they give them all
6790260	6794900	their bank account information and all their financial information so the the women apparently
6794900	6800260	like they have control over the finances of the men and then they get off by the women paying
6800260	6805860	their bills and not paying like spending too much for themselves well that's like an extreme I've
6805860	6810820	seen some of that it's like it's like like you see like their their women will go like send me your
6810820	6815060	send me your money you piece of shit like I saw documentaries about that like there's like it's
6815060	6820260	like it it's like it could just be expensive gifts like you're constantly sending them expensive
6820260	6825540	gifts and stuff and they're like telling you you dumb shits giving me all your money and then the
6825540	6836180	guys are like oh I know I know interesting so that's your thing Steve the the the delicious
6836180	6843060	frosting that grows on the bottom of the glass ceiling oh there's got to be some advantage
6844020	6847300	what about this like what if you had like a locket around your like you were given this like
6847300	6851140	necklace with a key in it and you don't you don't know what it is but you know it's an important
6851140	6855060	thing that you that was like it's like a destined a destiny key versus that's cool
6858100	6860340	also also you jizz ass it
6864260	6868420	it's like somebody just gave you a key at one point and said here's the deal giving you a key
6869300	6874500	if every time you think this is full of shit it's a test and you'll fucking die the minute
6874500	6878100	you I don't know are you saying like he's walking over the key that's like just a mind fuck
6878660	6881860	it's like it was like given to him like when he was too young to remember it's a mystery where
6881860	6885300	oh it's like it's like you know you give a locket like with half of an inscription and
6885300	6888740	then you like one day you'll find the other side and you'll learn some secret or some
6888740	6891220	village was killed and then he was left with a key
6891220	6901140	say what a keyhole I like somebody gave him a keyhole there's a keyhole on my chest
6901140	6904180	oh yeah there's a hole in you that's shaped like a keyhole
6904900	6910820	yeah that's good yeah all right so there's a keyhole in my chest it's like a wound like a
6910820	6917620	but your dick is shaped exactly like that key and I won't tell him I keep looking at it I'm
6917620	6922900	like I think I catch I catch it a light and then I check that like that's uh three prongs
6924100	6927220	I don't know how many times I have to look at it before I realize that's my dick's
6928180	6934180	hole how many people have a key dick yes like you have like you have to like take a lot of
6934180	6938100	yoga to like you're flexible enough to fuck your own chest he's always bowing
