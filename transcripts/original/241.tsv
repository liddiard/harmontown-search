0	13060	From our penultimate show here at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, Hermann
13060	39060	Meltdown is now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden and Anrod Schwab.
39060	46060	Do it! Do it! As the mayor of Harmentown, Dan Harmon.
46060	56060	Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
56060	65060	Happy Easter. Hello, Jane. How are you? How are the accommodations? Jane is staying at Shadyanadu.
65060	73060	There's no TV in that room, though. And also, Nigel may piss on your feet. We just ran out.
73060	77060	Yeah, the booze closet is right. It's off of the guest room, yes.
77060	89060	Nigel, our adopted dog, he... As opposed to Harvey, who you had naturally.
90060	94060	What was up with Harvey?
94060	97060	Looks like you got a lot of microphones on those chairs.
97060	101060	Seems like you got plenty over there where no one is.
101060	103060	I thought you guys were going to have two mics over here.
103060	109060	I thought that too. Yeah, that's what it sounded like.
110060	119060	Well, it's, you know, Nigel, he likes to burrow. He's like part sheet zoo. He's a foot-warmin' dog.
119060	123060	You're blaming Nigel for the lack of microphones?
123060	124060	Did he burrow through them?
124060	128060	And late last night, he burrowed down. Cody was just starting to get along with him.
128060	134060	They were just starting to like each other. And he burrowed down to the bottom of the bed.
134060	139060	And at some point during the night, he pissed on her feet. Under the blankets.
139060	145060	That's it. That's my story about him. I didn't come here tonight to talk about that.
145060	149060	So Cody hasn't learned to love Nigel?
149060	152060	Yeah, that was the most interesting part of that story.
152060	155060	There's no love lost. Wait, how does that expression work?
155060	158060	Has there been any love gained? You have to have loved...
158060	161060	There was no animosity between the two.
162060	169060	Nigel can be a little bit of a piece of shit. He's a garbage dog. He's a garbage, you know?
169060	171060	He causes trouble.
171060	175060	When I was first settling down with Cody into a monogamous relationship,
175060	182060	her first experiences with Nigel were her having to scrub him in the bathtub because he darts at skunks.
182060	190060	He's a waste of space, but he's here in my life forever.
190060	195060	I would not have adopted one dog, let alone two, had I seen...
195060	198060	Nobody sees divorce coming. I would not look at myself and go like,
198060	202060	now there's a guy that should have two of anything.
202060	207060	And while you're at it, make them mammals with emotional needs and stuff.
207060	210060	But don't get distressed if you're listening to this as a dog lover.
210060	214060	I know I can't watch hoarders episodes that involve the animals.
214060	217060	I'll just like, nope, this one's got cats in it. Nope.
217060	223060	Because the idea of an animal not being taken care of is very distressing, right, Rob?
223060	224060	Yes.
224060	226060	Okay, absolutely.
226060	228060	So do not listen to this podcast and think,
228060	233060	oh, does Dan have untended two dogs that are eating their own feet or anything like that?
233060	235060	No, that's just his friends.
235060	237060	No.
237060	242060	I throw a lot of money at making my dogs. They have a dog sitter who's...
242060	245060	But not at the audio department.
246060	250060	Rob, Steve Levy informed me that there's a microphone flying in for you right now.
250060	256060	So you're going to be well-miked. To the audiences, great detriment.
256060	259060	All right, look, I don't have anything. It's not like I have an act with a monologue.
259060	264060	This is sort of a farewell, like we're leaving the meltdown as a venue.
264060	267060	And this is our second-to-last show, as you pointed out.
267060	272060	And so we're saying goodbye to a place that's been our home for five years? Five years?
272060	277060	Can we bring the crickets and the people walking overhead?
277060	278060	Yes.
278060	280060	You never heard the sound of the crickets and the people go...
280060	282060	Well, I never heard the...
282060	284060	Look, it's been five years and we've been drinking a lot.
284060	288060	I'm sure a lot of stuff happened that I don't remember.
288060	291060	You never heard the ghost of old man Higgins haunting this place?
291060	301060	One thing I definitely remember is everyone always saying they miss Kumail Najiani.
303060	306060	And Emily Gordon!
316060	318060	Hello.
322060	324060	Oh, goodness.
324060	328060	Emily, Emily, welcome back, Kumail.
328060	330060	The baby's crying.
330060	332060	Kumail, welcome back.
332060	337060	Two guests the audience missed so much that Rob had to sit at a table with no microphone.
337060	341060	There's a lot of show tonight. We have a lot of friends coming.
341060	345060	Let's bring out the Harlem Globetrotters!
345060	349060	Oh!
357060	358060	Wow.
358060	360060	That was great. That was great.
360060	363060	I thought Meadowlark Lemon was much taller than that.
367060	370060	That would have been particularly funny to anyone who's never seen the show before.
370060	371060	I don't know what...
371060	373060	Who's that guy?
374060	377060	Do they have the Globetrotters here?
377060	381060	But no theme song. I was talking about the theme song.
381060	386060	As I pointed out, Emily, you're the George Washington of Harman Town.
386060	389060	You said to me at the Roost, you should have a podcast.
389060	391060	And then I was like, nah, I'd rather do a show.
391060	393060	We've already talked about this.
393060	400060	But you're the reason the show ever was here and existed here because of your involvement with...
401060	404060	Also, because this was a brand new space,
404060	409060	and I was desperately looking for shows for voices that didn't have a stage.
409060	412060	And this is what I thought needed a stage and needed an audience.
412060	414060	And I was just remembering, actually on the way here,
414060	419060	I remember the first show we ever had at 8 o'clock when the show started,
419060	424060	I was at the grove at the Apple Store trying to buy something for your laptop to hook up.
424060	427060	Do you remember that? Because you wanted to show a video.
427060	429060	Because it was so important.
429060	431060	It's so weird what I thought was important.
431060	435060	I remember the first couple weeks of doing shows here,
435060	439060	I would sit with Dustin Marshall after we started recording it in podcasting.
439060	444060	I remember he would go over to his place once a week and sit for like four to six hours.
444060	447060	It's editing the ums and errs.
447060	449060	And if you listen to the first couple episodes,
449060	451060	maybe you'll hear a weird stilted...
451060	453060	I'm like, what? Yeah, because that's what this podcast...
453060	457060	It's bread and butter, it's concision.
457060	460060	Anyways, at some point it just didn't have the time to do that.
460060	462060	And it was like, wait, the standards are way lower than this.
462060	464060	Obama just did Marin.
464060	466060	Yeah, anything could happen.
466060	469060	But they did edit the ums and errs.
469060	471060	And the drone strikes and the emails.
471060	473060	They deleted the emails!
473060	476060	And it was like 45 minutes of me at the Apple Store on the phone with Matt Myra,
476060	478060	of all people, trying to figure out...
478060	480060	Zach, I'm sure you remember this.
480060	483060	Yeah, and then I came back and I was like, oh, I'm so sorry, Dan.
483060	484060	I couldn't play the thing.
484060	486060	And you were like, that's fine, I shouldn't play the video.
486060	489060	And I was like, okay, cool, let's start the show then.
489060	493060	The only reason for whatever that equipment was is that the first show I did here,
493060	495060	it wasn't podcast, but it was like I had spent...
495060	500060	I stayed up all night designing this flag on Photoshop.
500060	502060	Wait, you did this?
502060	504060	This was like till 3 a.m. and then...
504060	505060	You did this?
505060	506060	Yes.
506060	508060	And you haven't fixed it.
508060	509060	No, that's it.
509060	510060	That's its final form, honey.
510060	511060	What do you mean fixed it?
511060	512060	It's great.
512060	513060	Well, I'm so sorry.
513060	514060	I didn't...
514060	515060	It's finished.
515060	518060	I mean, you know, it's all dithered and shit.
518060	519060	Well, okay.
519060	520060	Yeah, all right.
520060	521060	It's 8-bit.
521060	522060	It's cool.
522060	523060	Yeah, no, it's cool.
523060	524060	It's right.
524060	525060	What does this mean?
525060	528060	A city...
528060	530060	A city...
530060	532060	I'm acting like I can read Latin.
532060	533060	For our listeners...
533060	534060	I'm just looking at the Latin word.
534060	535060	I try to remember what my point was.
535060	538060	For our listeners, we're talking about the Harmon Town logo.
538060	539060	Poster.
539060	540060	Yeah.
540060	547940	I feel like it's a city founded without tyranny or society founded without tyranny, Latin written
547940	548940	without understanding.
548940	552060	Is that really what it says?
552060	553060	That's perfect.
553060	554060	It says Latin.
554060	555060	Wow.
555060	556060	Intellectum.
556060	557060	Yeah.
557060	558060	I bet that means understand.
558060	559060	Yeah.
559060	560060	Wow.
560060	561060	I mean, I Googled it.
561060	562060	Sure.
562060	563060	I don't speak Latin.
564060	565060	But I'd be cool if I spoke Latin.
565060	566060	I'd be some...
566060	567060	It is.
567060	569060	It's Latin for it does not translate.
569060	571060	Anyways, so...
571060	572780	We're very excited to be back.
572780	574580	I love this duo right here.
574580	576820	You guys are like the opposite, but the same.
576820	577820	It's good.
577820	578820	I like it.
578820	581620	Like in appearance, you could not be more different, but in demeanor, very close.
581620	582620	Yeah.
582620	583620	Well, it's definitely strong.
583620	588620	I mean, I hate to say it, but it's like, remember the magnet with the magnet and the iron filings.
588620	589620	And it's like...
589620	590620	Yeah.
590620	591620	Oh, with the iron filings?
591620	592620	Yeah.
593180	594180	It was filing.
594180	597180	Shrobs the default and then somebody had fun and made Spencer.
597180	598180	Right.
598180	601700	Well, somebody spent a lot of time and then somebody asshole came and shook it and it
601700	602700	showed.
602700	603700	And now you got Rob again, yeah.
603700	604700	Yeah.
604700	605700	I mean, just a little.
605700	606700	That's funny.
606700	607700	That's good.
607700	608700	Oh, yeah.
608700	609700	That's good.
609700	610700	Anyways.
610700	611700	Sorry, Spencer.
611700	614780	No, I like the idea of us both talking like we're both going because we're both sitting
614780	615780	here, you know?
615780	616780	Yeah.
616780	617780	Like that.
617780	620060	You're like the Statler and Waldorf of our Muppet Show.
620060	621060	Right.
621060	622060	Exactly.
623060	624060	Yeah.
624060	625060	So how's the movie going?
625060	626060	You go...
626060	627060	Boo!
627060	628060	What was the boo?
628060	629060	Just the scares?
629060	630060	Oh, because they were boo?
630060	631060	Oh, were you trying to scare us?
631060	632060	Oh, they would be like a boo.
632060	633060	This is a bad podcast.
633060	634060	It's bad.
634060	635060	We're statling.
635060	636060	Oh.
636060	637060	We're statling.
637060	638060	Oh.
638060	640620	I'm so sorry.
640620	643660	Look, we have too much show tonight.
643660	647780	We can't really technologically like handle how much show we have.
647780	649220	It's already buckling under the weight.
649220	650220	We're doing great.
650220	651220	Yeah.
651220	652220	You guys are doing great.
652220	653220	Yeah.
653220	654220	What's going on?
654220	655220	You guys have a hit movie.
655220	656220	No.
656220	657220	It's not out yet.
657220	658220	Oh, no.
658220	659220	It's not a hit movie.
659220	660220	It's not out yet.
660220	661220	It's not out yet.
661220	662220	Don't say that.
662220	663220	That's a curse.
663220	664220	It'll be out June 23rd.
664220	669980	God himself could not keep this from being a hit.
669980	673940	I'm counting my chickens and they're all chickens.
673940	674940	They're not...
674940	677380	Because they're not your chickens and you don't care.
677380	678380	You can jinx it.
678380	679380	I...
679380	680380	There are chickens!
680380	682380	There are eggs and they're all catberry eggs.
682380	683380	It's Easter.
683380	684380	Delicious.
684380	685380	I know, right?
685380	686380	Oh, my God.
686380	687380	Don't say that.
687380	688380	There's a lot...
688380	689380	Yeah.
689380	690380	You guys...
690380	695380	It's going up against fucking men who are spiders and apes that can talk and fucking...
695380	697380	We're going up against a lot of things.
697380	698380	Cars that become robots.
698380	702380	And then it's just a man finding a deeper understanding of himself.
702380	703380	And Baywatch.
703380	707380	When you say it's going up against them, do you mean...
707380	709380	Yeah, we're battling them.
709380	711380	In what sense...
711380	713380	You guys, this is how Hollywood works.
713380	717380	They put us in a room and make us fight each other and then whoever wins...
717380	718380	Wait, what's the actual question?
718380	721380	Well, you're distributing your own movie, so some people are probably curious about that.
721380	722380	What do you mean by going up against?
722380	724380	We're opening the same day...
724380	728380	We're going wide the same day as Planet of the Apes, which is a week out.
728380	730380	Oh, don't do that.
730380	731380	That's bad.
731380	732380	Oh, my God.
732380	733380	Don't do that.
733380	734380	Boo!
734380	735380	Don't do that.
735380	736380	Don't do that.
736380	738380	You should tell them that to do that.
738380	739380	Yeah.
739380	742380	Okay, I'll send an email, motherfucker.
742380	745380	I'm literally sweating right now.
745380	747380	So, we open July 13th.
747380	751380	It's a week after Spider-Man, two weeks after Transformers.
751380	754380	Also, The House, which is a Will Ferrell Amy Poehler comedy.
754380	755380	These are all things for...
755380	756380	You know, they call that Hollywood.
756380	759380	They call it the sweet spot.
759380	760380	Right.
760380	761380	You guys are right.
761380	764380	I like everyone's getting scared here, like, oh, no.
764380	766380	They shouldn't have done that.
766380	770380	Is there a different league you're allowed to play in, if that would be your option?
770380	774380	I don't dwell on this DIY feature world where...
774380	778380	Is there a way to not have to compete with...
778380	779380	Well, what we're doing is...
779380	781380	No, because the movie theaters...
781380	782380	We'll tell them.
782380	784380	There's a couple of interesting things that we didn't know.
784380	789380	So, we're opening only three cities, and then we're going to slowly expand,
789380	791380	and they want to go up to pretty big.
791380	794380	Lionsgate is releasing it, so it's going to get...
794380	798380	If it can support it, it'll get ultimately a pretty big release,
798380	799380	but it's only starting in three cities.
799380	800380	Like a lion.
800380	803380	Like a lion roaring into your theaters, yes.
803380	804380	But there's a thing.
804380	807380	It's called CinemaCon, and what you do is...
807380	808380	Oh, wow.
808380	811380	It's a convention, and you go, and all the movie theater owners are there,
811380	814380	and you show them parts of your movie,
814380	817380	and you try and convince them to play it in their theaters for you.
817380	818380	Well, there's two roles.
818380	819380	They'll have different...
819380	822380	They'll have celebrities there that are there to, like, be, like,
822380	824380	rewards for the cinema owners to be, like,
824380	825380	oh, my God, you guys are so great.
825380	826380	You get the rock.
826380	830380	And then they have us, who are, like, just begging them to, like,
830380	831380	look how great we are.
831380	832380	You want to see this movie, right?
832380	833380	Put it in your theater.
833380	835380	So, like, we spent the entire time...
835380	839380	They got wooed by the rock, and then we begged them, basically.
839380	840380	Those are the two levels.
840380	841380	Wouldn't you say?
841380	844380	Well, you begged, but, you know, they were very excited to meet me.
844380	845380	No.
845380	846380	They don't...
846380	847380	They don't give a shit.
847380	850380	It was the rock and John Cena, and then us.
850380	852380	And what was funny was that Amazon...
852380	855380	Amazon is the one who bought it, but they're releasing it in theaters.
855380	856380	They had a thing.
856380	857380	They're like, we're going to do a sketch.
857380	858380	We're going to be like,
858380	860380	bring up the marketing head of Amazon,
860380	863380	and then you come out, and you've kidnapped the guy.
863380	865380	And I was like, most people are just going to think,
865380	868380	oh, that's the marketing head of Amazon.
868380	869380	You do look like a marketing head.
869380	870380	That's true.
870380	872380	Oh, I guess that's the guy.
872380	877380	He's slightly more comfortable on stage than you would think.
877380	879380	What is the third city?
879380	880380	Chicago.
880380	881380	Okay.
881380	883380	You know, the second city is the third city.
883380	885380	The second city is the third city.
885380	889380	But the plan is to keep expanding as much as we can, but...
889380	890380	Okay, we get it.
890380	891380	Yeah, baby!
891380	892380	To those of you listening,
892380	895380	Rob Schaub has gotten a microphone.
895380	897380	It's not working, though.
897380	898380	It's fine.
898380	899380	Perfect.
899380	900380	Leave it exactly...
900380	901380	That's great.
901380	902380	That's perfect.
902380	904380	It should not be hooked up to anything.
904380	905380	Can we get this...
905380	908380	Can we get less Rob in the monitors, please?
909380	910380	You want to try again?
910380	911380	Try again.
911380	912380	Is it?
912380	913380	Hello?
913380	914380	Oh, shit!
914380	915380	You got your shot.
915380	916380	Yeah.
916380	922380	Okay, so today I was at Dito's Easter dinner party,
922380	927380	and I was talking to somebody that works at Starburn's studio,
927380	928380	our modest studio,
928380	932380	and I was running my hands blithely through my locks
932380	935380	because I was kind of high, and then I was feeling...
935380	937380	And then every once in a while I felt something.
937380	939380	It was like, wait, is there a bug in my hair?
939380	942380	I don't know, but it didn't feel enough like that.
942380	943380	It was probably a leaf.
943380	945380	I mean, if it was a spider and I touched it,
945380	948380	it'd be gone by now or it'd bit me or whatever.
948380	950380	I keep running my hands through my hair,
950380	952380	and I'm just listening to the conversation.
952380	955380	And this story does not go where you think it's going to go.
955380	960380	I have never been more excited for a story.
960380	962380	No, it's going to disappoint you that you're going to realize...
962380	964380	I was turned on by blithely through my locks.
964380	967380	So I finally touched something that felt...
967380	971380	It triggered my fingers to think that I was like...
971380	973380	I did feel like my body felt like,
973380	977380	oh, there's something in my hair that's alive
977380	978380	or that shouldn't be there,
978380	981380	and my reaction was my honest-to-God reaction
981380	984380	as I was talking to this woman.
984380	987380	I was just talking to her in a driveway,
987380	990380	and then I was like, yeah, and then she was like, ah!
991380	993380	I threw it...
993380	995380	It turned out to be nothing,
995380	997380	but if there had been something in my hand,
997380	999380	I would have thrown it onto her.
999380	1001380	But from her perspective, you were just like,
1001380	1002380	hey, hey, ah!
1002380	1004380	Yeah, she didn't...
1004380	1005380	Surprise!
1005380	1007380	I was telling Dino later, I was like,
1007380	1009380	yeah, I was talking to...
1011380	1014380	I guess she'll never know that I'm a horrible coward
1014380	1017380	that would throw a bug on her if it was on my head.
1017380	1018380	Wait, what was it?
1019380	1020380	It was nothing, I don't know.
1020380	1022380	I was high, I was high, and so I was just like, ah!
1022380	1025380	Dan, there was that tree in the backyard that kept...
1025380	1027380	Oh, there's probably things falling off of it.
1027380	1030380	Yeah, there's these little small, furry flowers that would come out.
1030380	1032380	So that makes sense.
1032380	1034380	What if it was a bunch of little dicks?
1035380	1037380	That's a valid question.
1037380	1039380	My favorite is his smug face after it.
1039380	1042380	Look at that. He's so happy.
1042380	1045380	Can we get Camera 7 on Rob's smug face right now?
1045380	1048380	That costs five bucks a month, that smug face.
1048380	1051380	Otherwise, you just have to hear the free audio of what if it was dicks.
1052380	1053380	A little tiny.
1053380	1054380	A bunch of dicks in your hand.
1054380	1055380	Yeah.
1055380	1056380	Okay.
1056380	1057380	What if that was...
1057380	1058380	You ever think about that?
1058380	1059380	Yeah.
1059380	1060380	Ran a mic out for him.
1060380	1063380	But then Dino said...
1063380	1064380	Dino said, no.
1064380	1068380	Five people had to scramble to find out a way to get Rob a mic.
1068380	1071380	I had to make it worth it for that.
1072380	1074380	But then Dino said, oh, no.
1074380	1076380	No, she's very low key.
1076380	1077380	She's cool.
1077380	1079380	And I said, nobody's cool with someone throwing a bug on them.
1079380	1080380	Because she didn't react at all.
1080380	1081380	She just thought I went...
1081380	1082380	Well, then she is cool.
1082380	1083380	And he's like, no, no, no.
1083380	1084380	She's...
1084380	1086380	Well, what if you threw a bunch of little dicks at her?
1086380	1087380	Yeah.
1087380	1089380	All right. Let's bring up Brandon Johnson.
1089380	1090380	Yeah.
1090380	1103380	Brandon Johnson.
1103380	1104380	Well-dressed.
1104380	1106380	This bug story is riveting.
1106380	1107380	Yeah.
1107380	1109380	I just said, you know, it's...
1109380	1110380	Yeah.
1110380	1112380	But then what came up in that story was...
1112380	1113380	Well, whatever.
1113380	1114380	No, no, no.
1114380	1115380	Get to it.
1115380	1116380	Well, I can't...
1116380	1117380	Because I named her my name now.
1117380	1118380	And then I...
1119380	1120380	We'll take the name out.
1120380	1121380	I actually didn't hear the name.
1121380	1122380	Oh, okay.
1122380	1123380	All right. Yeah.
1123380	1124380	Maybe we can bleep out the name.
1124380	1127380	Her name was Stephanie.
1127380	1128380	So then...
1128380	1134380	Because then when I thought it was fascinating, Dino said, yeah, have you ever really talked
1134380	1135380	to her?
1135380	1139380	Like, she is a Christian to some degree.
1139380	1145380	Like, I don't want to invade this person's privacy or like speak for their ideology.
1145380	1146380	How dare you.
1147380	1150380	I think she's like a 12th degree Christian.
1150380	1151380	He said...
1151380	1152380	He said, she's like...
1152380	1154380	She's like a brown belt.
1159380	1163380	He said, she's very low key and it's because of her beliefs, because I was talking to her
1163380	1165380	at one point, I was like, oh, that was very nice of you.
1165380	1166380	And she's like, oh, please.
1166380	1171380	You know, if I didn't think God was watching, I'd just put my foot on someone's face and
1171380	1173380	just grind it into the cement.
1173380	1174380	She said that?
1174380	1175380	She said that.
1176380	1178380	But God is hearing you say that.
1178380	1179380	Right.
1179380	1180380	But God's...
1180380	1183380	I mean, you know, it's an extrinsic God.
1183380	1186380	He's like, thank you for thinking that and then showing some restraint.
1186380	1187380	I got to take a poop.
1187380	1188380	I'll do it in the toilet.
1188380	1191380	I want to grind that person's face into the pavement.
1191380	1193380	I'm going to not do that.
1193380	1194380	It's Thanksgiving.
1194380	1197380	God is going to go take a poop in the toilet?
1197380	1198380	He's like, that's interesting.
1198380	1200380	I have to take a shit anyway.
1200380	1202380	That's what volcanoes are.
1202380	1204380	It made me wonder...
1204380	1205380	Is God taking a poop?
1205380	1206380	Yeah.
1206380	1207380	Is he upside down?
1207380	1208380	Yes.
1208380	1209380	He's inside there.
1209380	1210380	God is in the center of the earth.
1210380	1213380	And his shit is like white hot.
1213380	1214380	Right.
1214380	1216380	Because he eats so sins.
1216380	1217380	Sexy.
1217380	1218380	Yeah, he eats all the sins.
1218380	1219380	That's what Pompey was.
1219380	1221380	They got caught in some shit.
1221380	1222380	More like poop-ay anyway.
1222380	1223380	Pompey!
1223380	1225380	Little dicks, little dicks.
1225380	1227380	Hey, little dicks, little dicks.
1227380	1229380	Sorry, Camille's got to go.
1229380	1231380	Here's Camille Nogiani, everybody.
1234380	1235380	He's very hurt.
1235380	1237380	My husband is very hurt right now.
1237380	1238380	Poop-ay.
1238380	1239380	That shit doesn't scan.
1239380	1240380	We drove by a hot church today.
1240380	1241380	You know the hot church?
1241380	1242380	The hot...
1242380	1243380	Hot church?
1243380	1244380	The hot Christian church?
1244380	1245380	There's a...
1245380	1249380	Oh, is that when the girl puts her foot in the back of your head and then your dick goes
1249380	1252380	in your own butt and...
1252380	1253380	Yes.
1253380	1255380	What are you talking about?
1255380	1257380	Are you talking about mosaic?
1257380	1258380	Yeah!
1258380	1259380	Mosaic.
1259380	1260380	You guys know mosaic?
1260380	1263380	It's a very LA church that's like hot, sexy...
1263380	1264380	Hipsters.
1264380	1265380	Hipsters.
1265380	1266380	Wait, is that the one on...
1266380	1268380	Like when I make a right coming on Highland or...
1268380	1269380	Yeah, the Hollywood and Highland.
1269380	1270380	And Hollywood and the Brit.
1270380	1271380	There's a bunch of...
1271380	1272380	For all you Macs.
1272380	1273380	A bunch of models hanging out.
1273380	1274380	Yeah.
1274380	1278380	And they're not inside worshiping God, they're all outside getting phone numbers and shit.
1278380	1279380	Can I say something?
1279380	1281380	There was a step and repeat outside of mosaic.
1281380	1283380	We were driving here because it's Easter.
1283380	1285380	Step and repeat is where you go to like stand in front of like a red carpet.
1285380	1288380	They have like a red carpet in front of their church today.
1288380	1289380	For God.
1289380	1290380	For God.
1290380	1291380	It's a holiday.
1292380	1295380	Yeah, and there were girls in stripper heels and I was like, let them...
1295380	1297380	Let them worship too, you know?
1297380	1300380	Let's G not be just...
1300380	1302380	Unless you just...
1302380	1303380	Let's G.
1305380	1306380	That's right.
1308380	1310380	Just like my dad used to say.
1310380	1311380	Well, I guess that's what I was thinking.
1311380	1313380	Your next answer is coming out.
1313380	1315380	Rendering to Caesar was to Caesar is...
1315380	1318380	But get your dollars out for Magdalene.
1319380	1322380	There were really hot people there.
1322380	1323380	Super hot.
1323380	1324380	There's always hot people there.
1324380	1326380	No, I make a right driving here all the time.
1326380	1329380	And sometimes I just want to pull over and start going to that church.
1329380	1330380	Yeah.
1330380	1331380	Everybody's good looking.
1331380	1332380	Yes.
1332380	1334380	That's maybe the way in to Christianity.
1334380	1338380	And also those people probably would grind your face into the pavement if they didn't
1338380	1341380	think that there might be a God that would prevent them from getting phone numbers.
1341380	1343380	As long as they're grinding.
1344380	1347380	It made me think too...
1347380	1348380	Maybe we don't...
1348380	1352380	We kind of tend to look at religion as problematic and go like,
1352380	1354380	well, there's people that take it too seriously.
1354380	1359380	They think all kinds of things and they use it to justify violence against people
1359380	1360380	and oppression and all this stuff.
1360380	1367380	But how much of it is the glue that holds our nation's many, many stupid together
1367380	1372380	and just keeps them in their living rooms and maybe keeps them away from the polls?
1372380	1375380	Wait, the stripper or voting?
1375380	1377380	Yeah, which polls?
1377380	1379380	Oh, stripper or voting?
1379380	1380380	Say both.
1380380	1383380	He or Jesse Jackson and say both.
1384380	1389380	You know, I mean, I've come around to the conclusion and I know I'm late on this one,
1389380	1390380	but everyone's dumb.
1390380	1393380	Like, most people are dumber than you.
1393380	1397380	And then you add into that, what's it called?
1397380	1399380	The Dunning Krueger?
1399380	1401380	Dunning Krueger?
1402380	1405380	I've been having that spit at me on Twitter.
1405380	1406380	I don't know what that is.
1406380	1409380	It's when you're an idiot, you think that everyone else is an idiot
1409380	1412380	because you can't conceive of even average intelligence.
1412380	1415380	The dumber you are, the smarter you think you are.
1415380	1417380	It's the Lake Wobegon Effect, they used to call it,
1417380	1421380	but they actually kind of like, where everyone's above average, that thing.
1421380	1427380	They administered a test to everybody, whatever, a group of people.
1427380	1430380	And then they said, last question.
1430380	1431380	How do you think you did?
1431380	1437380	And then they've mathematically proven that, yeah, the more wrong you are,
1437380	1441380	let's not say dumber, because the interesting thing about the Radiolab,
1441380	1444380	not Radiolab, but American Life Pieces that I was talking about,
1444380	1446380	the one I had to say, I was like, you could be,
1446380	1448380	this is just for anything that you're dumb about.
1448380	1454380	Like, if Stephen Hawking went from astrophysics into how to administer a catheter,
1454380	1457380	like, he, within two weeks, he'd be like...
1457380	1459380	That's not the guy I would pick.
1459380	1461380	Is he using his mouth?
1461380	1466380	Even if I don't know much about Stephen Hawking, can I get a little help?
1466380	1467380	Stephen Hawking...
1467380	1469380	A little help over here?
1469380	1471380	Look at Rob, look at Rob.
1471380	1473380	Rob's giving a very good impression of what that would look like.
1473380	1475380	I'll try to use less distracting examples.
1475380	1479380	By the way, that was him 20 years ago.
1479380	1485380	But you would, he would, for all, for as smart as he is about black holes,
1485380	1487380	and as much as he would probably say,
1487380	1489380	because he's super smart about black holes,
1489380	1493380	he probably assumes you and I know more about black holes than we're capable of.
1493380	1495380	That's the other end of the effect.
1495380	1499380	But he would also, within two weeks of learning how to administer a catheter,
1499380	1503380	as a nurse, he would go, you know what, I got this.
1503380	1505380	I could teach this at a university.
1505380	1507380	Because he wouldn't know that much about it.
1507380	1511380	But he'd think, well, that's that effect.
1511380	1513380	The dumber you are at anything, the less you know,
1513380	1516380	the more certain you are that you actually know something.
1516380	1519380	It really does make sense, and it's actually not that,
1519380	1521380	it's not because you're angry or hateful or bigoted.
1521380	1526380	It's actually just the nature of stupidity and intelligence makes perfect fucking sense.
1526380	1532380	So now that we know that, can we just kill all the dumb people before they kill all of us?
1532380	1535380	That's been our show, guys. Good night.
1535380	1536380	Thanks for coming.
1536380	1539380	Because that really mathematically proves they're going to kill us.
1539380	1543380	That's really scary, because that means that there are no solutions.
1543380	1545380	It really means that there's no way out.
1545380	1548380	It's a horrible ringing endorsement.
1548380	1551380	Because they're just going to get more confident the less they know.
1551380	1554380	And then it's not a huge billboard for democracy.
1554380	1556380	No, it really is not.
1556380	1559380	They're like, hey, thinking about medical care?
1559380	1561380	Let the masses decide.
1561380	1566380	Well, most of us are so dumb we think cancer is a privilege.
1566380	1570380	They're like, why should I pay for other people's cancer?
1570380	1571380	I'll never get it.
1571380	1573380	No, but you're so dumb.
1573380	1575380	You're so dumb, you're going to get cancer.
1575380	1576380	No, I'm not.
1576380	1579380	I've thought about this for 30 minutes.
1579380	1582380	No, but that's less time than a doctor.
1582380	1585380	Well, that's the thing that bugs me about climate change and stuff,
1585380	1587380	where they're like all these so-called experts.
1587380	1589380	Yes, they are experts.
1589380	1591380	This is what they study.
1591380	1593380	If you want to be able to play Minecraft,
1593380	1598380	that means other people have to spend a bunch more time than you thinking about the fucking earth and shit.
1598380	1599380	That's right.
1599380	1602380	I don't know nothing about no taxes or Medicare or nothing,
1602380	1604380	so just take my money.
1604380	1605380	Take my money.
1605380	1607380	When your fridge breaks down, what do you do?
1607380	1610380	You take it to a person who knows how to fix fridges.
1610380	1611380	That's right.
1611380	1616380	I'm glad we could agree as wealthy Americans.
1616380	1619380	Everyone needs to wise up and stop being dumb
1619380	1622380	and just make a bunch of money and sit and play video games.
1622380	1623380	That's all you have to do, you guys.
1623380	1624380	That's all you have to do.
1624380	1627380	I think people have a right to be stupid, though, if they want to be stupid.
1627380	1629380	Yeah, but then don't be confident about it.
1629380	1630380	They should be more ashamed.
1630380	1631380	They should be more ashamed.
1631380	1632380	They should be ashamed.
1632380	1634380	There was a culture in this country.
1634380	1636380	There is a culture in this country.
1636380	1638380	Where you were dumb and then you'd hear yourself say something
1638380	1641380	and then you'd go like, oh, I'm stupid.
1641380	1642380	Oh, whoa, whoa.
1642380	1644380	And then you'd go back in your basement.
1644380	1645380	Amen.
1645380	1647380	Go back in your basement.
1647380	1650380	Listen, I hear what you're saying, but I'm just saying,
1650380	1652380	people do have a right to be stupid,
1652380	1654380	and there's nothing we can really do about it.
1654380	1655380	They have more than a right.
1655380	1657380	They control the fucking planet.
1657380	1658380	Yeah, they are controlling the planet.
1658380	1661380	You're talking like we live in some Logan's Run world
1661380	1663380	where we control Carousel.
1663380	1665380	Where are the crosshairs?
1665380	1667380	Stop staring at me, Kumail.
1667380	1670380	I can't believe the things you've said.
1670380	1674380	I do think, I think it used to be that stupid people were,
1674380	1677380	and I hate, I mean, people who thought themselves not as smart
1677380	1679380	used to be ashamed of that fact,
1679380	1682380	and I do think there is this idea now that like,
1682380	1685380	no, that's somehow a right, like a right that you,
1685380	1686380	no one can take away from you.
1686380	1688380	Being ignorant has become like a positive trait.
1688380	1689380	It's interesting.
1689380	1691380	In America.
1691380	1693380	We're in the second act of a Disney movie,
1693380	1696380	like Blank Check, or Gum Drop Tree,
1696380	1699380	or What If You Had A Car, you know,
1699380	1704380	like a Disney movie that fulfills like a kid's fantasy,
1704380	1706380	where the second act is like, you could,
1706380	1709380	you mean Rick Dukeman left a blank check,
1709380	1711380	and I can now have a party at my house,
1711380	1716380	and it does the montage of like, oh, I've no grown ups allowed.
1716380	1719380	There's a giraffe loose in the backyard.
1719380	1724380	They're sick and tired, people are sick and tired
1724380	1728380	of all these smarty pants is telling them they're stupid,
1728380	1732380	and now we're just living in the second act of their novel.
1732380	1735380	Well, what's going to happen in act, it's their novel.
1735380	1736380	Right.
1736380	1737380	They're going to learn their lesson.
1737380	1738380	Well, they're going to, they should learn their lesson.
1738380	1742380	Hopefully, they'll like find out that being Teen Wolf is not worth,
1742380	1745380	like, your teammates not getting to play basketball.
1745380	1749380	What happens in the third act of What If I Had A Car?
1749380	1751380	That's a good question.
1751380	1752380	They run people over.
1752380	1753380	That's a good question.
1753380	1754380	I mean, there's always, you know, it's like...
1754380	1756380	That's third act?
1756380	1757380	Wow.
1757380	1758380	Yeah.
1758380	1760380	So what's going to happen?
1760380	1761380	What do we do?
1761380	1762380	There's no...
1762380	1765380	I have never felt this...
1765380	1766380	I've always been very optimistic,
1766380	1769380	and I still feel pretty optimistic overall,
1769380	1773380	but my optimism now comes from the fact that at some point,
1773380	1776380	we'll all die, and Earth will regenerate itself,
1776380	1779380	and millions of years from now, new life world will start.
1779380	1780380	Yeah.
1780380	1782380	And it won't be...
1782380	1784380	Look, everybody's so nihilistic.
1784380	1785380	Yeah.
1785380	1787380	Well, I've been focusing on my...
1787380	1789380	Cody, like, we're just...
1789380	1791380	All we know is that we have each other now,
1791380	1794380	and we're just hoping that the missile hits, like, right on my house.
1794380	1795380	I feel like...
1795380	1797380	Because I don't want to have to shoot my dogs.
1797380	1798380	We were...
1798380	1799380	Yeah.
1799380	1800380	We were literally...
1800380	1802380	That's the first thing you're going to do.
1802380	1804380	These dogs got to go.
1804380	1806380	I don't know what's going to happen.
1806380	1807380	That reminds me...
1807380	1808380	We have to pick up...
1808380	1809380	It was a hoax, Dan.
1809380	1810380	It was a hoax.
1810380	1811380	Because explaining to them...
1811380	1814380	That, when I think about explaining to my cat what's happening...
1814380	1818380	Oh, I am so jealous that she has no fucking idea.
1818380	1819380	She's so happy right now.
1819380	1820380	She's just like,
1820380	1823380	Why can't I go outside in the morning anymore, Mommy?
1823380	1827380	Imagine how stoked your cat would be if you could really explain everything to it,
1827380	1828380	because your cat would also be...
1828380	1831380	You mean I'm part of a selectively bred species,
1831380	1833380	doomed to die of renal failure,
1833380	1838380	because the cost-benefit ratio peaks out for my species,
1838380	1842380	and I'm going to spend the last six months of my life trapped in a home,
1842380	1844380	walking around, yowling...
1844380	1851380	And while you inject bags into the scruff of my neck of cat fluid,
1851380	1856380	because I've become nothing more than a cat-shaped container for cat fluid...
1856380	1858380	Isn't that what they always are?
1858380	1859380	But then you go...
1859380	1860380	Isn't that what a cat is?
1860380	1861380	A cat-shaped container?
1861380	1862380	Yeah, but it's self-generated.
1862380	1863380	There's a pride there.
1863380	1864380	I don't know.
1864380	1866380	Shouldn't everyone adopt a Chinese kid?
1866380	1868380	But we don't.
1868380	1870380	We keep wanting it to look like us.
1870380	1871380	And the cat's like,
1871380	1873380	Yeah, I wish it was my own cat fluid.
1873380	1875380	It doesn't like that anymore than we do.
1875380	1876380	But then you tell it like,
1876380	1878380	Oh, no, there's a missile that's been launched.
1878380	1880380	The cat would be the most stoked thing in your house.
1880380	1881380	Because it would go like,
1881380	1883380	Wait, I get to go out with humanity?
1883380	1884380	Yeah.
1884380	1888380	Instead of being in a Chinese takeout container on your mantle,
1888380	1891380	because you always meant to scatter my ashes.
1891380	1893380	Totally.
1893380	1896380	It's ultimate equality, nuclear warfare.
1896380	1899380	We're all the fucking same.
1899380	1900380	We were in Seattle,
1900380	1902380	and we were reading this thing that was like,
1902380	1903380	Don't worry.
1903380	1905380	If Kim Jong Un launches a missile,
1905380	1907380	it can only get to Seattle.
1907380	1909380	We were literally in Seattle.
1909380	1911380	We were on the plane, and I was like,
1911380	1914380	Fucking take off right now.
1914380	1918380	How long would it take for a missile from North Korea to get here?
1918380	1920380	I've heard minutes, but who knows?
1920380	1921380	Minutes?
1921380	1923380	I don't think that's true.
1923380	1924380	Who knows?
1924380	1925380	I hope just long enough.
1925380	1927380	Minutes?
1927380	1929380	Your response was,
1929380	1931380	It feels like what?
1931380	1934380	What feels right?
1935380	1938380	Then why does it take five hours to get to Milwaukee?
1938380	1939380	Minutes.
1939380	1940380	Minutes?
1940380	1943380	So it's like a missile is like your same missile is super fast?
1943380	1948380	If I find out that North Koreans can get to Seattle in minutes,
1948380	1951380	and it takes me five hours to get to New York,
1951380	1953380	that's fucking bullshit.
1953380	1956380	I'd rather be blown up.
1956380	1959380	Well, now you know that, so.
1959380	1960380	Still straps.
1960380	1961380	Still straps.
1961380	1962380	Yes, go ahead, Strom.
1962380	1963380	Go ahead, Strom.
1963380	1966380	He knocked his mic out of his own stand.
1966380	1969380	Strom made the same observation with Milwaukee instead of New York.
1969380	1971380	Just moments before.
1971380	1974380	With the same amount of time, you said five hours to Milwaukee,
1974380	1975380	you said five hours to New York.
1975380	1976380	Majorism.
1976380	1978380	Why is your plane slower?
1978380	1980380	I gotta stop in Las Vegas.
1980380	1983380	Okay, sure.
1983380	1985380	Because there's a layover to go to Milwaukee,
1985380	1987380	you can fly direct to New York.
1987380	1988380	But I don't think...
1988380	1989380	Las Vegas.
1989380	1990380	You gotta see Britney Spears.
1990380	1992380	Her show's about to finish, yeah.
1992380	1993380	That makes sense.
1993380	1995380	But there is a comfort, right, to the idea of just like...
1995380	1997380	Just going away, all this horseshit disappears.
1997380	1998380	That's not so bad.
1998380	2001380	Just having a final countdown, like lighting a candle with your girlfriend and like...
2001380	2002380	This is it.
2002380	2004380	We have an hour left, what do you want to do?
2004380	2007380	Fuck, I never finished Sopranos.
2007380	2009380	We never even started Sopranos.
2009380	2011380	Yeah, it'll be like some kind of like,
2011380	2014380	well, we got two hours to kill, what do you want to watch?
2014380	2015380	Yeah.
2015380	2016380	It'll be like...
2016380	2018380	I'll be like, well, we should watch Gone with the Wind,
2018380	2020380	I never watched that, right?
2020380	2021380	Great British Bake Off.
2021380	2022380	We all great British Bake Off.
2022380	2025380	We spent 45 minutes arguing about what we want.
2025380	2026380	Yeah, yeah.
2026380	2029380	Or wherever an order from, is anybody even going to deliver?
2029380	2030380	I'm going to get...
2030380	2031380	Was there two hours left?
2031380	2032380	Anything I want.
2032380	2033380	Fried rice?
2033380	2034380	Fried rice.
2034380	2035380	Fuck, yeah.
2035380	2036380	Donuts, fried rice, oh my God.
2036380	2037380	I don't know if anyone wants to deliver.
2037380	2039380	I'm actually getting excited for the apocalypse.
2039380	2040380	Yeah.
2040380	2043380	You guys are making me so hungry to die.
2043380	2044380	Yeah.
2044380	2045380	I don't want to live through it.
2045380	2047380	I don't want to be on a wasteland fighting cannibals for gasoline.
2047380	2048380	I want to go.
2049380	2051380	I don't want to use my teeth for money.
2051380	2052380	Yeah.
2054380	2057380	Are you going to cross the ferry, sir?
2057380	2063380	Nobody gets across the ferry without paying homage to Armorall.
2063380	2064380	Armorall?
2064380	2066380	His name is Armorall?
2066380	2067380	Armorall.
2067380	2068380	Oh, you're Armorall.
2068380	2069380	He keeps your seat shiny.
2069380	2073380	In the apocalypse, a lot of tires aren't shiny enough.
2073380	2075380	By the way, teeth are pretty good,
2075380	2078380	because it would have to be something that there's a limited quantity of.
2078380	2080380	What do you do with the teeth, though?
2080380	2083380	Pre-radiation, precious.
2083380	2084380	What do you do with them?
2084380	2085380	It's for currency.
2085380	2086380	It's money, yeah.
2086380	2088380	Yeah, and the future teeth are like pearls,
2088380	2091380	and you can wear beautiful necklaces to show people how far you've gotten in life.
2091380	2092380	Oh.
2092380	2095380	It would only be scarcity that you'd be training on.
2095380	2098380	It would just be like, well, I know that these are worth...
2098380	2099380	I have eight times as much as...
2099380	2101380	It's only what the dollar is.
2101380	2103380	What if it was a bunch of little dicks?
2106380	2107380	That's right.
2107380	2108380	I would love to wear that necklace.
2108380	2111380	In the future, the currency will be a bunch of little dicks.
2113380	2115380	Rob, rob, rob, rob, rob, rob.
2115380	2117380	That would be like a hundred dollar bill.
2117380	2118380	Yeah.
2118380	2121380	What is the exchange rate between a bunch of little dicks and some teeth?
2121380	2123380	You don't want teeth to steal your dicks.
2123380	2124380	My bad.
2126380	2127380	I'm so sorry.
2127380	2131380	By the way, you can catch Kumail in Mass Effect Andromeda.
2131380	2133380	Yes, I am in that.
2133380	2135380	Is that game good? I haven't played it.
2135380	2137380	I just started playing it.
2137380	2139380	It seems a little chunky.
2139380	2142380	Like, in terms of loading, isn't it like a little...
2142380	2144380	Don't fat shame the game, man.
2144380	2147380	I'm fat shaming its memory drain or something.
2147380	2150380	If you're a console game, I shouldn't be experiencing...
2150380	2152380	You're load shaming it.
2152380	2153380	What?
2153380	2156380	Load shaming, because it takes a long time to load.
2156380	2157380	Load shaming it, yeah.
2157380	2159380	There's a few issues, but it's mostly very, very good.
2159380	2160380	Yeah.
2160380	2161380	He likes it.
2162380	2164380	I don't know why it is...
2164380	2166380	I've been on an airplane and saw some movie.
2166380	2169380	There's a Franco in a hiblets or something.
2169380	2171380	And then there's you, like a thing.
2171380	2173380	I'm like, oh, there's Kumail.
2173380	2177380	What did I think I was going to see him doing?
2177380	2178380	It's like, oh, he's in a movie.
2178380	2179380	That's his job.
2179380	2180380	Comedy movie.
2180380	2182380	But then when you're playing a video game and you hear your friend's voice,
2182380	2183380	it's really weird.
2183380	2184380	I'm sorry.
2184380	2188380	It's closer to if you were in a porn movie that I was watching.
2188380	2191380	Actually, I was in a movie called Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.
2191380	2194380	That was very pornographic.
2194380	2197380	I've been afraid to play it.
2197380	2199380	You know, I asked to be in it.
2199380	2203380	There was a developer of Mass Effect who would talk to me sometimes
2203380	2204380	and I was just like, fuck it.
2204380	2205380	What's the point?
2205380	2208380	So I just DMed and I was like, hey, can I be in it?
2208380	2210380	And it's totally fine if you say no.
2210380	2212380	And then I'm the president in the game.
2212380	2216380	But now it kind of sucks because now I don't want to play it
2216380	2220380	because I'm like, what if I fucked it up and I fucked up my favorite video game?
2220380	2224380	So I'm very nervous to play it.
2224380	2226380	I mean, you know, it's a Mass Effect game.
2226380	2230380	The only thing you're going to ruin would be a conversation between
2230380	2231380	upgrading your armor.
2231380	2234380	It's like, God damn it, I fucked up Mass Effect.
2234380	2237380	Yeah, well, they made me program the whole thing.
2237380	2238380	Oh, okay.
2238380	2239380	Can I tell you?
2239380	2241380	It's a little chunky.
2242380	2247380	It was very racist of them to assume that I would be the guy for it.
2247380	2248380	But you did it.
2248380	2249380	I did it.
2249380	2250380	I figured it out.
2250380	2251380	I went on Wikipedia.
2251380	2256380	I could never figure out the chunk problem.
2256380	2257380	How far in are you?
2257380	2258380	How many hours?
2258380	2259380	Two minutes.
2259380	2260380	Okay.
2260380	2261380	So I show up that early.
2261380	2263380	Well, you're in the...
2263380	2266380	I'm not spoiling anything.
2266380	2269380	You know, your character, not your character, the royal you,
2269380	2273380	your character in Mass Effect, the protagonist, is, you know,
2273380	2275380	there's a little kind of a cold open...
2275380	2276380	He's a pathfinder.
2276380	2278380	...where a thing happens that's like kind of a disaster
2278380	2279380	and it puts you in charge.
2279380	2283380	And so then you come in shortly after when he's sort of like,
2283380	2286380	you have to figure out, oh, I guess I'm the new boss.
2286380	2288380	And then you're checking in with your crew.
2288380	2290380	Is this a game where you get to design your look?
2290380	2291380	How do you look?
2291380	2292380	Yes, yes.
2292380	2293380	What's your stance on that?
2293380	2295380	Thank you for bringing that up.
2295380	2296380	Because I want to know...
2296380	2297380	What are you just talking about?
2297380	2298380	What is wrong with me?
2298380	2300380	Because I can't...
2300380	2302380	Because I made a character and I gave him like...
2302380	2305380	And I was like, well, I'm going to give myself like gray hair
2305380	2307380	because I want to like be old and be in this game.
2307380	2308380	Turns out it's not an option.
2308380	2309380	You have a dad that's like...
2309380	2313380	So I just gave myself gray hair, but I'm like younger than my dad.
2313380	2314380	But yeah.
2314380	2315380	But like I always...
2315380	2317380	I try to make it look like myself.
2317380	2318380	Yeah.
2318380	2319380	And then...
2319380	2322380	But Justin Roiland, co-creator, Rick and Morty, season three,
2322380	2325380	coming to a time era near you.
2326380	2328380	Justin, like...
2328380	2330380	I remember going over to his house when he was playing Skyrim
2330380	2332380	and it was like, what the fuck?
2332380	2333380	And he's like, yeah, no, I always do that.
2333380	2336380	I was just trying to make the person look as fucked up as possible.
2336380	2337380	I'm like...
2337380	2338380	So he just...
2338380	2340380	He just tried to...
2340380	2342380	However close together the eyes can be.
2342380	2344380	However wide the ear...
2344380	2346380	He'll just make every extreme choice
2346380	2349380	and like come up with this like weird potato man that like...
2349380	2351380	And it makes so much more sense to me.
2351380	2354380	And while I'm making my character in Mass Effect,
2354380	2356380	there's some really impressive hairstyles.
2356380	2358380	And one of them was like this very like fro to out thing.
2358380	2360380	So I had already created...
2360380	2363380	I had already made it look a lot like me to me as much as I could.
2363380	2365380	But then I was scrolling through the hairs
2365380	2367380	and one of them was just like, bam!
2367380	2369380	Like this powerful fro.
2369380	2374380	Like all tangled, not like a statesman in the 70s.
2374380	2379380	Like this guy had bigger fish to fry spiritually.
2379380	2382380	And it was so funny.
2382380	2384380	It made me laugh out loud, but I didn't use it.
2384380	2386380	And it was like why am I not following my joy?
2386380	2388380	It's like you could do literally anything but you're like
2388380	2390380	no that wouldn't be true to the character.
2390380	2391380	Exactly.
2391380	2392380	It's like I didn't want to throw...
2392380	2393380	No.
2393380	2394380	It's like I want to come as close as I can to...
2394380	2395380	You can do anything you want.
2395380	2396380	I agree with you.
2396380	2397380	I don't...
2397380	2399380	I think if you want to set out to make yourself, then make yourself.
2399380	2402380	And don't give yourself a fro.
2402380	2404380	But what is that narcissistic impulse?
2404380	2407380	We're playing games because we want to be someone else, right?
2407380	2409380	I'll defend myself.
2409380	2411380	It's because I think the ironic thing is me...
2411380	2413380	Like I'm Woody Allen when I'm in the...
2413380	2414380	During the Russian Revolution.
2414380	2415380	Yeah, sure.
2415380	2416380	So like that's why...
2416380	2418380	I figured the bigger laughs are to come if it looks just like me.
2418380	2420380	Which by the way it can't because as Cody...
2420380	2422380	Cody walked to the room.
2422380	2423380	I said, did I make it...
2423380	2426380	I tried to make it look like me and she saw it and then she laughed.
2426380	2427380	And she's like, you can't...
2427380	2428380	You can't...
2428380	2429380	You can't make them fat.
2429380	2430380	Like you can't.
2430380	2431380	That's the thing.
2431380	2432380	I think a lot of people...
2432380	2433380	That's my problem with video games.
2433380	2435380	You can never make them fat.
2435380	2436380	I want to make them fat.
2436380	2440380	I think a lot of people have had serious kind of emotional breakdowns
2440380	2442380	designing their bodies in these games.
2442380	2443380	Oh, we had a...
2443380	2448380	We did one where I was trying to make myself for this basketball game
2448380	2450380	and she was giving me advice on what to do.
2450380	2452380	And we almost got into a very big fight.
2452380	2453380	There's a mistake.
2453380	2456380	I was like, that's not how I look.
2456380	2458380	And she's like, move the eyes closer together.
2458380	2459380	I did not.
2459380	2461380	Emily.
2461380	2462380	Emily.
2462380	2463380	I will say that you could...
2463380	2464380	Fat her face.
2464380	2465380	Emily.
2465380	2466380	I did say fat her face.
2466380	2468380	You found other ways to say those things.
2468380	2469380	This is what I'm talking about.
2469380	2472380	When you're having to pick your body type for a video game,
2472380	2473380	it can be a very...
2473380	2476380	It's a confrontive thing to do for your emotional...
2476380	2478380	So I say always make something weird.
2478380	2479380	Always be a tap person.
2479380	2480380	Do you spend...
2480380	2481380	I get sucked in.
2481380	2483380	If I have four hours to play a video game,
2483380	2484380	which is like a big deal.
2484380	2485380	Oh, my God.
2485380	2486380	I found four hours.
2486380	2488380	And it's one of those games where...
2488380	2490380	Prepare to dock with the space station.
2490380	2491380	Bop, bop, bop, bop.
2491380	2492380	Oh.
2492380	2493380	Check the mirror.
2493380	2495380	See if your face looks all right.
2495380	2496380	Bloop.
2496380	2497380	And then...
2497380	2498380	Three and a half.
2498380	2499380	I mean...
2499380	2500380	That's your time.
2500380	2501380	Yeah.
2501380	2502380	The whole time.
2502380	2503380	And every time you try to make it look like you.
2503380	2504380	Is that right?
2504380	2505380	Or every time you...
2505380	2506380	Yeah.
2506380	2507380	I've never really...
2507380	2508380	Unless there have been maybe some games
2508380	2510380	where it was so clear that I couldn't make it look like me at all.
2510380	2514380	That I was able to make some decision in my head
2514380	2515380	that it didn't have to be me.
2515380	2518380	But mostly I'm just like trying to make it look like me.
2518380	2519380	I think that's good.
2519380	2521380	I think that's totally good.
2521380	2524380	If you're playing this game, you're in the game.
2524380	2525380	It shouldn't look like you.
2525380	2527380	I totally agree with you.
2527380	2530380	And I try and do that too.
2530380	2531380	Except when Emily's around.
2531380	2533380	Because that's not good.
2533380	2537380	For the basketball game, you literally couldn't go as short.
2537380	2539380	Like the lowest height they had.
2539380	2540380	No.
2540380	2541380	They literally like...
2541380	2544380	In the basketball game, I couldn't get to my height.
2544380	2547380	So I had to be one inch taller than I am.
2547380	2550380	And they wouldn't let me be my actual age.
2550380	2553380	And they wouldn't let me be my actual age.
2553380	2556380	So my dream is over that I'll ever end up in the NBA.
2556380	2557380	Even they're like, come on.
2557380	2560380	And you had to be on a different HBO show.
2560380	2561380	Yeah.
2561380	2562380	They were like, you got to be on Veep to play this game.
2562380	2564380	Doesn't seem like they should have by now.
2564380	2565380	They should.
2565380	2568380	I guess it's because there isn't a standard technology yet.
2568380	2569380	And it wouldn't...
2569380	2572380	The private industry isn't incentivized to do this.
2572380	2573380	But we have the technology...
2573380	2574380	To do anything.
2574380	2576380	You could be at a mall or something.
2576380	2579380	And you'd go like, oh, I should get one of those.
2579380	2580380	Because I play a lot of video games.
2580380	2582380	One of those being you step into a kiosk
2582380	2584380	and they just do a scan.
2584380	2587380	And then you walk out with a file on a thumb drive.
2587380	2592380	That every game that's based on an avatar of a human being,
2592380	2593380	it's always you.
2593380	2594380	So it's always hilarious.
2594380	2596380	But then you get to see what you actually look like.
2596380	2597380	No, that's really funny.
2597380	2598380	I mean, believe me, I try.
2598380	2599380	I go to Cheeks.
2599380	2601380	I try.
2601380	2603380	And that's why it always stops at some weird place
2603380	2606380	where it's like the game has decided you need to be athletic.
2606380	2608380	But I want to look like a bowling kid
2608380	2610380	with Randy Quaid's head on it.
2611380	2613380	What's the machine look like?
2613380	2616380	Do you step in like a booth or do they like...
2616380	2617380	It's a bunch of little dicks.
2617380	2618380	It's like an air...
2618380	2619380	It looks like a...
2619380	2621380	Do they give you like a hula hoop head?
2621380	2624380	There should be a setting for like a hot Bruce Balanch.
2624380	2625380	Oh.
2625380	2627380	Or a sexy Russell Crowe.
2627380	2629380	In the booth?
2629380	2630380	Is there a booth?
2630380	2632380	I'm talking about a booth right now.
2632380	2633380	Obviously it looks like a booth.
2633380	2634380	It's like a TSA booth.
2634380	2635380	Obviously it looks like a booth.
2635380	2636380	Or like a ticket booth
2636380	2638380	when you catch all the tickets or dollars.
2638380	2639380	No, it's TSA.
2639380	2640380	TSA booth.
2640380	2641380	It's a screening booth.
2641380	2642380	It looks like a TSA booth.
2642380	2643380	It looks like a...
2643380	2645380	So you got to put your arms above your head.
2645380	2646380	I don't know.
2646380	2647380	You'd probably go like this.
2647380	2648380	So below your head.
2648380	2650380	So below your head the whole time.
2650380	2652380	Do you keep your clothes on?
2652380	2653380	Yeah.
2653380	2654380	Now that's a good question actually.
2654380	2655380	You probably know what your butt looks like.
2655380	2658380	You put on like a special blue...
2658380	2661380	Like neo-cream suit.
2661380	2663380	I bet Rob you could make yourself in a video game.
2663380	2664380	Oh Rob's the easiest one.
2664380	2665380	You're the default.
2665380	2666380	I bet you would be the default.
2666380	2668380	I can never look like the starter guy.
2668380	2669380	The starter guy you're like done.
2669380	2670380	Yeah.
2670380	2673380	The crash test dummy looking guy.
2673380	2675380	Yeah, you know it doesn't even have the option of Spencer.
2675380	2676380	I never...
2676380	2678380	Yeah, it's like this guy's not wearing shorts.
2678380	2680380	Like he doesn't have a beard.
2680380	2681380	It's terrible.
2681380	2682380	They don't have good beard options.
2682380	2683380	There's more to you than that.
2683380	2684380	They don't have...
2684380	2685380	You know, there's never...
2685380	2687380	Like if there's a male ponytail
2687380	2688380	or even just, you know,
2688380	2690380	you can pick female hair options as a male character.
2690380	2691380	Holy shit.
2691380	2693380	That's better than most games I play.
2693380	2695380	It's just like I always look like a weird like
2695380	2699380	Cheech and Chong, like cigar Indian kind of guy, I think.
2699380	2702380	Cigar!
2702380	2704380	So you try to make yourself look like you too.
2704380	2705380	Well, I can't.
2705380	2706380	Well, but you would like to.
2706380	2709380	I would, yeah, but I have to compromise.
2709380	2710380	It's just never occurred to me.
2710380	2712380	And I don't know if it's because I'm a...
2712380	2713380	I don't know if it's because I'm a lady
2713380	2715380	and I never had the option up until three weeks.
2715380	2717380	Oh, so now we're all sexist.
2717380	2719380	That's what I was... Exactly, thank you.
2719380	2722380	But I mean, to me I never played video games to be me.
2722380	2723380	I played video games to be someone else
2723380	2726380	because I'd never had the option to be me until recently.
2726380	2727380	But I think that...
2727380	2729380	I think there's just a real distinction there.
2729380	2732380	Would I be shocked if we found out you could cross-reference it
2732380	2735380	with gender of modern gamer?
2735380	2737380	I wouldn't be shocked to see there was a co-relation of the data,
2737380	2738380	but I also think it's...
2738380	2740380	It just seems to me, I just think, oh, this is...
2740380	2741380	I'm a narcissist.
2741380	2745380	I'm just like, look, it's a negative word narcissist,
2745380	2747380	but we didn't pull them as they...
2747380	2748380	Let's pull them.
2748380	2751380	But it's not going to be an honest pull because...
2751380	2752380	Be honest.
2753380	2755380	Now it will be an honest pull.
2755380	2756380	Everyone, close your eyes.
2756380	2759380	If you're on a third date and you brought her to Harman Town,
2759380	2761380	first of all...
2761380	2762380	Don't do that.
2764380	2766380	First of all, bad third date.
2766380	2768380	But you're not going to be like, yes, I'm a narcissist.
2768380	2769380	I don't know. I mean, maybe...
2769380	2770380	No, but I don't think...
2770380	2773380	I'm not saying that because you want to make yourself in a video game,
2773380	2774380	you're a narcissist.
2774380	2776380	Okay, but I put that in their heads.
2777380	2779380	All right, so by applause,
2779380	2782380	when you play video games that let you design the character,
2782380	2785380	how many of you strive to make it yourself?
2787380	2788380	That's a solid number.
2788380	2793380	I call that 50% of the American public.
2793380	2794380	Cat people?
2794380	2795380	Yeah!
2795380	2796380	Cat people?
2796380	2797380	I always do cat people.
2797380	2799380	How about a bunch of little dicks?
2803380	2804380	Or vaginas.
2805380	2806380	Again, be honest.
2806380	2809380	How many of you would always design your avatar or your player
2809380	2811380	to be something totally different than you?
2813380	2815380	But they're more extroverted people,
2815380	2817380	so they sound like more people.
2817380	2819380	I would call that 40-60, though.
2819380	2820380	Yeah, pretty close.
2820380	2821380	It's pretty close.
2821380	2822380	A lot of little dicks.
2822380	2825380	It almost sounded like half and half,
2825380	2827380	but the people that are more extroverted, altruistic,
2827380	2829380	that are like, I want to be someone else.
2829380	2830380	I'm selfless.
2830380	2831380	I'm a wonderful person.
2831380	2832380	I mean, I'm not a big...
2833380	2834380	That's a very good point.
2834380	2836380	What he said was, it's because I hate myself.
2837380	2840380	But he did say it out loud in a room full of people.
2841380	2842380	Good point.
2842380	2843380	Good point.
2843380	2844380	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
2844380	2846380	And then you subdivide that tree.
2846380	2848380	When you get to a point of hating yourself,
2848380	2850380	when do you consider yourself a biological weapon
2850380	2851380	that you fling at people?
2851380	2854380	But I guess we're mostly not Trump voters.
2854380	2857380	But that's that troll culture of like,
2857380	2858380	you know what?
2858380	2859380	I'm so gross.
2859380	2861380	Society's not made for me.
2861380	2863380	I'm going to fucking fling myself on you
2863380	2865380	like multiple MiGs in a fucking...
2865380	2866380	That's right.
2866380	2867380	Good reference.
2868380	2870380	That is what trolls are.
2870380	2872380	They weaponize themselves and just like fling themselves
2872380	2873380	at other people.
2873380	2874380	Yeah, look how gross I am.
2874380	2877380	That's why the smart people can be into Donald Trump.
2877380	2878380	I'm not saying it goes hand in hand,
2878380	2880380	but I'm saying that's why it's possible
2880380	2881380	for that archetype to exist.
2881380	2883380	Because if you feel enough like, you know,
2883380	2885380	the prom queen's always winning,
2885380	2887380	let's see how she likes it.
2887380	2890380	And it's like, the more he misspells tweets,
2890380	2892380	the more he reveals himself.
2892380	2894380	That's that connection.
2894380	2898380	However, I think his revealing that he has no interest
2898380	2900380	in net neutrality and also wants everyone's...
2900380	2901380	I know.
2901380	2902380	I think he's losing his computer troll demo.
2902380	2905380	Well, because he doesn't really stand for anything, obviously.
2905380	2907380	And so that's been like...
2907380	2908380	It's so...
2908380	2909380	I mean, there's so much...
2909380	2912380	Why don't you stop talking about politics?
2912380	2914380	Get back to doing your podcast.
2914380	2917380	Hey, you know that Fate of the Furious
2917380	2919380	did really well this weekend.
2919380	2920380	Now that's what I'm talking about.
2920380	2922380	That's why I come to this podcast.
2922380	2924380	I want to hear about recent movies.
2924380	2929380	Outdid that Force Awakens, that Fate of the Furious.
2929380	2930380	All right.
2930380	2932380	That's that car movie.
2932380	2933380	Yeah, he won.
2933380	2934380	Get over it.
2934380	2935380	Get back to your podcast.
2935380	2937380	Tell me about the Fate of the Furious.
2937380	2941380	Now, Dan, when we started with Sharpie and Quark
2941380	2943380	back a long time ago in D&D,
2943380	2945380	you picked a fighter character.
2945380	2948380	Like, you want to be like a tough warrior character.
2948380	2950380	A furious one.
2950380	2951380	What?
2951380	2953380	And fast.
2953380	2956380	So like, attribute-wise, you want to be somebody else.
2956380	2958380	But physically, you want to still...
2958380	2961380	If you could draw yourself in that world, it's you.
2961380	2962380	But you can kick ass.
2962380	2964380	And he did for Harmon Quest.
2964380	2967380	I assume you had a say in the design of your character.
2967380	2968380	That looked like you.
2968380	2970380	Well, I had a say in the fact that it's funny.
2970380	2971380	If you're doing...
2971380	2972380	Right.
2972380	2974380	Like, recognize the formula that people need to look like the people.
2974380	2975380	Right.
2975380	2980380	But in point of fact, when we've played D&D here, Pathfinder,
2980380	2986380	and all that stuff, I've made a conscious effort to not...
2986380	2988380	Like, I don't try to...
2988380	2992380	I haven't played like stealthy assassin-coward characters,
2992380	2994380	which I usually play when I was...
2994380	2995380	Notetaken.
2995380	2997380	Like...
2997380	2999380	Because I actually was like...
2999380	3001380	I didn't have that thought in my head.
3001380	3003380	I was like, well, when you played when you were a kid,
3003380	3005380	you always were engaged in this weird...
3005380	3009380	Like, oh, it's you as the coolest guy in the world.
3009380	3011380	Like, that's gonna be your character.
3011380	3014380	And then when we started playing up here, I was like,
3014380	3016380	yeah, why don't you do what normal people do
3016380	3019380	and play like a fantasy character that you aren't, you know?
3019380	3020380	So be like a...
3020380	3021380	Yeah, I don't know.
3021380	3022380	Like a warrior.
3022380	3023380	But that's why I want to be like a cleric
3023380	3025380	when we start playing again like a holy person
3025380	3027380	because I want to split the diff
3027380	3030380	and have the right to be wrong about shit.
3030380	3031380	And I'm good at stuff.
3031380	3033380	By the way, we are...
3033380	3036380	Dan and I have drawn characters up with Spencer.
3036380	3040380	We are starting up a new role-playing thing coming up.
3040380	3041380	We just wanted to...
3041380	3043380	We want to time it with our move to the new space.
3043380	3044380	For a Harman town?
3044380	3045380	Amazing.
3045380	3046380	When we go to the new space,
3046380	3048380	we're gonna actually kick off a whole new campaign.
3048380	3049380	Wow.
3049380	3051380	How do you feel about moving, Dan?
3051380	3052380	Yeah.
3052380	3056380	Are you having any sort of emotional feelings?
3056380	3059380	Emotional feelings as opposed to unemotional feelings.
3060380	3062380	Are you having any sort of emotions about it?
3062380	3064380	What feelings are you having?
3064380	3066380	And what emotions?
3066380	3068380	Well, I don't know.
3068380	3073380	You know, I guess I have like a weird intellectual version
3073380	3077380	of an emotion, which is that I feel like...
3077380	3079380	Do you...
3079380	3080380	I don't know.
3080380	3083380	Like, I feel like I'm supposed to feel stuff
3083380	3084380	and that makes me feel...
3084380	3085380	Oh, no, you don't have to.
3085380	3086380	No, no, no.
3086380	3087380	I'm just asking.
3087380	3089380	I'm not saying you're making me...
3089380	3090380	pressuring me to have feelings.
3090380	3091380	I feel, when I think about it,
3091380	3093380	I feel like I'm supposed to feel things
3093380	3095380	and then that makes me feel sad.
3095380	3096380	Just like the...
3096380	3098380	Remember when The Sleep With Me,
3098380	3100380	our friend came on the podcast?
3100380	3103380	You weren't here, but it's just part of my endless quest
3103380	3105380	to fill your fucking vacuum.
3105380	3106380	We had a...
3106380	3108380	We had a guy in here.
3108380	3109380	Shut up.
3111380	3113380	Everything's been fine since you left.
3114380	3116380	I've always been here, Dan.
3117380	3120380	But, The Sleep With Me guy, he was...
3120380	3122380	Anyways, we were talking about...
3122380	3123380	What is...
3123380	3126380	He was so close to hitting that new Kumail role in our team.
3126380	3127380	Who is this?
3127380	3129380	We were talking about a chorus line in the musical.
3129380	3131380	It doesn't matter. Don't get distracted by any of my tangents.
3131380	3133380	We were talking about a chorus line in the musical
3133380	3136380	and the character in that musical has that song
3136380	3138380	about how she feels nothing.
3138380	3141380	And then on the nuances of that, about how feeling nothing
3142380	3144380	can actually be the most emotional experience you have.
3144380	3146380	That's how I feel about Meltdown.
3146380	3148380	And Meltdown said, do you?
3148380	3150380	Well, you've been here for five years
3150380	3152380	and you've done lots of shows.
3152380	3155380	And I dug breakdown in my podcast heart
3155380	3158380	and thought, I've been in this room for a long time
3158380	3161380	and I look at the pillars that are always in the way
3161380	3162380	and I...
3162380	3165380	They said to be a comic.
3167380	3169380	And I feel nothing, but...
3169380	3172380	But your show's not going away, so you don't have to feel
3172380	3175380	like we stopped doing our show in October.
3175380	3177380	We did it for six years.
3177380	3178380	Okay.
3178380	3179380	How do you guys feel?
3179380	3181380	You just heard about it?
3181380	3184380	What is your feeling? What's your emotional state?
3184380	3185380	I was like...
3185380	3186380	I cried a bunch.
3186380	3188380	I was sad when it happened, but now,
3188380	3190380	even though it's only been a few months,
3190380	3192380	it's kind of, to me, this sucks.
3192380	3194380	It kind of feels like it never happened.
3194380	3196380	It's this weird thing where when I like...
3196380	3199380	Every now and then, I'll get a ghost of a feeling
3199380	3201380	of what it felt like to do that show,
3201380	3205380	but for the most part, it feels like it never happened.
3205380	3207380	It's sad, but...
3207380	3209380	Okay, another NPR piece.
3211380	3213380	These people that have...
3216380	3218380	Superior...
3218380	3220380	Fuck, why is it called...
3220380	3222380	Superior...
3222380	3223380	I don't like it.
3223380	3225380	...biographical memory or something like that?
3225380	3226380	Uh-huh.
3226380	3227380	Sumac?
3227380	3230380	It's very similar to photographic memory,
3230380	3233380	but they have just instant recall of any detail
3233380	3234380	from their own life.
3234380	3236380	They're not always 100% accurate,
3236380	3239380	but they can remember every day and every moment.
3239380	3242380	You spend this time super jealous of them
3242380	3244380	because how could that ever be bad?
3244380	3246380	They can be like,
3246380	3248380	oh, what's the best season of Friends?
3248380	3250380	Well, I'd have to go back to episodes.
3250380	3252380	I was like, holy shit, that's a superpower.
3252380	3254380	You must be great in a writer's room.
3254380	3256380	You would be great at everything you do.
3256380	3258380	You'd be great in a relationship.
3258380	3259380	Aha!
3259380	3261380	They remember every fucking relationship.
3261380	3263380	They remember how in love they were,
3263380	3265380	like it was yesterday.
3265380	3268380	They're not able to forget the day it turned
3268380	3270380	from good to bad.
3270380	3273380	They're not able to forget how it felt
3273380	3276380	to be willing to die for somebody
3276380	3279380	and then to feel that same way about another person
3279380	3281380	two years later.
3281380	3283380	And then they're both,
3283380	3285380	and they're haunted by...
3285380	3287380	Well, I think part of getting over something
3287380	3289380	is having to forget some of it.
3289380	3291380	You kind of want...
3291380	3294380	Time is best served ever coldening.
3294380	3297380	Very like put, actually.
3297380	3298380	He's right.
3298380	3301380	Life is something that you want to happen right now,
3301380	3304380	not a while from now and not a minute ago.
3304380	3308380	You want it, even though it seems like a huge waste,
3308380	3310380	you kind of want to die.
3310380	3312380	Eventually.
3312380	3314380	And then when it thinks you're going forward
3314380	3316380	and you have an emotion that feels like when you felt before,
3316380	3318380	that's how you end up feeling connected
3318380	3322380	to this deeper current of whatever the emotion is.
3322380	3324380	And that's a lovely feeling, I think,
3324380	3326380	when you get just that hint of like,
3326380	3327380	oh, I've felt this before.
3327380	3329380	Whether or not it's pain or happiness or whatever it is,
3329380	3331380	that's the shit to me.
3331380	3333380	That taps you into the ocean.
3333380	3335380	When you have an emotion now
3335380	3337380	that reminds you of an emotion that you had earlier.
3337380	3339380	Because it's a big thing in therapy to be like,
3339380	3341380	okay, when have you felt this way before?
3341380	3344380	Because often you're actually reacting to something that happened
3344380	3347380	like five clicks back in your emotions,
3347380	3349380	but you haven't dealt with it yet,
3349380	3351380	so it's just coming up now.
3351380	3353380	Oh, wow.
3353380	3355380	My therapist, obviously,
3355380	3357380	missiles are about to drop on us and all this stuff,
3357380	3359380	so she's a therapist.
3359380	3361380	So there's a lot of anxiety.
3361380	3363380	For me, it's also like I'm 44,
3363380	3365380	and I'm right in the fucking crevice.
3365380	3369380	I'm right in the tile grout between the bathroom tile
3369380	3372380	where you're part of the Brotherhood of Man,
3372380	3374380	not to be exclusionary,
3374380	3377380	and then the bathroom tile where you're kind of
3377380	3379380	one of these old fogeys that we all hate,
3379380	3380380	that archetype that's just like,
3380380	3382380	well, fuck off, young folks.
3382380	3384380	Get off my lawn and enjoy Medicaid or whatever.
3384380	3387380	And you're kind of like, this isn't my battle.
3387380	3388380	You wouldn't hire me anyway.
3388380	3389380	You're ageist.
3389380	3391380	And I'm just like, I'm getting close,
3391380	3394380	like where I can start ignoring the world
3394380	3397380	and claim that I lived my life and paid my dues.
3397380	3399380	But I'm right in between there,
3399380	3402380	and I never did shit for anybody the first go-round.
3402380	3405380	And so I was explaining this to her.
3405380	3407380	I'm like, I don't know when to care and when not to care.
3407380	3408380	I don't know if that's like,
3408380	3411380	I feel like the nerve ending's deadening in my soul,
3411380	3414380	but at the same time, I feel like I'm remapping my neurology.
3414380	3415380	Now I care about people,
3415380	3419380	but now I'm just realizing how fucking dumb they truly are.
3419380	3423380	And my therapist said like, she's like,
3423380	3426380	let me tell you the story, a joke I heard.
3426380	3430380	And she says, so there's this cop, and he's walking.
3430380	3434380	And then there's, he sees this drunk guy
3434380	3436380	stumbling around in the dark.
3436380	3439380	And the cop goes up to him and says,
3439380	3441380	hey, what are you doing?
3441380	3443380	What's going on with the cop?
3443380	3448380	And the guy, the therapist is terrible at telling jokes.
3449380	3454380	And the guy says like, well, I'm drunk and I lost my keys.
3454380	3456380	I'm trying to find my keys. I can't find them.
3456380	3462380	And the cop says, well, where was the last time you saw them?
3462380	3464380	Where'd you have them? Where'd you lose them?
3464380	3468380	And the guy says, oh, back over there, you know,
3468380	3469380	down the block there.
3469380	3473380	And the cop says, why the hell aren't you looking over there?
3473380	3477380	And the guy says, well, this is where the light is.
3477380	3480380	And I said to the therapist who, believe it or not,
3480380	3482380	told the joke pretty much that way. That wasn't me.
3482380	3486380	I was like, well, there was a lot of pipe in that fucking first act.
3486380	3489380	Like, are you sure we shouldn't feed it in the police academy
3489380	3492380	when the cop's like, but then there's no more I thought about it.
3492380	3494380	I'm like, oh, I'm the cop.
3494380	3496380	That's what she was inviting me to.
3496380	3498380	The atonement with the stupidity.
3498380	3500380	You go, wait a minute.
3500380	3503380	This person, dunning Kruger effect, whatever.
3503380	3507380	You go, oh, this person doesn't get it.
3507380	3510380	They don't know that they're not going to find their keys over here
3510380	3512380	just because this is where the light is.
3512380	3515380	But there's darkness all around us, and everyone's drunk,
3515380	3516380	and everyone's stupid.
3516380	3518380	And if you are privileged enough to be a cop,
3518380	3522380	it means that you knew somebody or lived long enough to get a badge
3522380	3523380	and you're walking around,
3523380	3525380	and part of your job is to help people.
3525380	3528380	And they're dumb.
3528380	3530380	But you don't have to like, you know,
3530380	3533380	that story wouldn't make sense if the cop pulled out his nightstick
3533380	3535380	and started beating that man in the head.
3535380	3536380	That would make sense.
3536380	3539380	It is what would happen on Facebook,
3539380	3542380	but if you were that cop, you wouldn't do that.
3542380	3545380	It wouldn't make sense, because he's only just stupid.
3545380	3548380	He's not doing anything wrong.
3548380	3550380	And I was like, oh, yeah.
3550380	3553380	And I was like, wait, but isn't that nihilism?
3553380	3555380	Isn't that just kissing cousins with nihilism?
3555380	3557380	And isn't that what the bad guys think?
3557380	3559380	Nothing matters, so let's just fuck shit up.
3559380	3562380	And she's like, well, you can spend your meaningless life
3562380	3564380	doing whatever you want.
3564380	3568380	You can care about people, or you can hurt them.
3568380	3571380	And I was like, oh, like a video game, which is what we do.
3571380	3575380	When we're disconnected, some people enjoy their disconnection
3575380	3576380	by hurting things.
3576380	3579380	And when I play video games, I tend to go like,
3579380	3580380	oh, I get it.
3580380	3581380	Ah, that fucking prostitute.
3581380	3583380	I shouldn't have hit her with a baseball bat.
3583380	3585380	Like you...
3585380	3587380	Wait, but you still hit her with a baseball bat?
3587380	3588380	I shouldn't have hurt her.
3588380	3591380	I was learning what the buttons did.
3591380	3592380	That's what they all say.
3592380	3594380	That's actually what they all say.
3594380	3595380	The man says it to you, ladies.
3595380	3596380	Do not listen to that shit.
3596380	3597380	I'm so sorry.
3597380	3598380	Get out of there.
3598380	3599380	Get out of there.
3599380	3602380	That makes it easy to hit a prostitute with a baseball bat.
3602380	3604380	It practically happens by default.
3604380	3607380	There's a button that makes you pick up a baseball bat
3607380	3608380	and hit a prostitute.
3608380	3609380	If you are holding a bat...
3609380	3610380	It's an X button.
3610380	3612380	Anyway.
3612380	3613380	It's a square, actually.
3613380	3616380	No, but I remember playing Half-Life, the first Half-Life.
3617380	3619380	The first half of Half-Life?
3621380	3623380	One fourth life.
3623380	3625380	It was quarter life.
3625380	3627380	There was a scientist that was like...
3627380	3628380	I remember...
3628380	3630380	You're not going to react to...
3630380	3632380	I'm still here.
3633380	3634380	I'm sorry.
3634380	3636380	Anyway, I remember...
3636380	3639380	There was a scientist in my way or something
3639380	3644380	and I had to shoot him with a shotgun.
3644380	3646380	Rob, are you going to miss Meltdown?
3646380	3648380	Yeah, sure.
3648380	3650380	Yeah.
3650380	3652380	What are you going to miss most about it?
3652380	3654380	Yeah, are you crying?
3654380	3657380	No, my spit went down the road.
3657380	3659380	It's 9-11.
3659380	3664380	This is the only room where people are like, 9-11!
3664380	3667380	Emily and Camille, you guys have been in the long guys.
3667380	3668380	This is your place.
3668380	3669380	You guys were here.
3669380	3670380	Well, we haven't.
3670380	3671380	We kind of...
3671380	3673380	This is when we did our last show here
3673380	3676380	and we haven't really been here that much.
3676380	3678380	What's weird for me about this place is...
3678380	3680380	I have a lot of memories about theaters,
3680380	3682380	the places you've performed.
3682380	3685380	But this place, because it's this low dark ceiling,
3685380	3691380	it's like a little weird outer space little box.
3691380	3694380	I'm not going to look back on this and be able to draw it.
3694380	3696380	It'll just be empty space.
3696380	3698380	And looking down and seeing Spencer over there,
3698380	3701380	and seeing Brandon here, and you guys here down this line,
3701380	3703380	and then the first three rows of people here,
3703380	3705380	for better or for worse.
3705380	3708380	This space is like the opposite of an Indian burial ground.
3708380	3710380	This space is magical.
3710380	3713380	It is absolutely magical and the most positive way.
3713380	3715380	The first time I came in here,
3715380	3717380	when we were visiting Los Angeles,
3717380	3720380	we came here because a friend of ours said that there was a show here
3720380	3723380	and I walked in and I was like, I just want to be here.
3723380	3725380	And the first time I went to that room in the back,
3726380	3728380	I'm like, yeah, it's magical.
3728380	3731380	Actually, we just walked in because there was a comic book shop
3731380	3733380	because we ate across the street.
3733380	3735380	And then when we were here, we heard...
3735380	3736380	There happened to be a show.
3736380	3738380	Yeah, we came back here and we watched...
3738380	3740380	So does that mean the shows at our new place are going to suck?
3740380	3741380	No, but you'll...
3741380	3742380	Consecrate it.
3742380	3744380	No, but what I will take away from this place
3744380	3748380	is not like any of the architecture or the geography of this place.
3748380	3752380	It'll really be like people memories,
3752380	3755380	not physical, like spatial memories.
3755380	3758380	But I bet there will be like the smell of the place.
3758380	3760380	At some point, years from now, you'll walk in here
3760380	3763380	and you'll be like, oh my God, I didn't know that this place smelled like this.
3763380	3765380	Or just the feel of the air conditioning.
3765380	3767380	Yeah, or like the fucking cricket, you know?
3767380	3768380	The cricket.
3768380	3769380	The fucking cricket.
3769380	3771380	And by the way, there were extra poles here.
3771380	3773380	There used to be extra...
3775380	3778380	There used to be extra poles here that we got removed earlier.
3778380	3781380	But when we leave here, what happens to this room?
3781380	3783380	When this is not a theater anymore...
3783380	3785380	It cools off a little, I'll tell you that, for nothing.
3785380	3786380	That's for sure.
3786380	3788380	Will this be used as...
3788380	3789380	Yeah, there's still shows here.
3789380	3791380	There'll still be shows here, I think.
3791380	3792380	Who's buying this place?
3792380	3793380	What's it going to be?
3793380	3794380	Oh, I don't know.
3794380	3796380	And even if I...
3796380	3798380	Is somebody buying the place?
3801380	3803380	I don't know why we're leaving.
3803380	3805380	I've never really asked that question.
3805380	3807380	Dan, you should buy the place.
3808380	3811380	I think we've overstepped our bounds.
3813380	3815380	Just the back room, though.
3815380	3819380	I will say that it has been my dream for a while
3819380	3823380	to move into a venue that was just like the equivalent of
3823380	3826380	I would liken it to taking a fish from an aquarium
3826380	3828380	and putting it in a slightly larger aquarium
3828380	3831380	simply to make sure we're not stunting the fish's growth.
3831380	3832380	Absolutely.
3832380	3835380	Not because we want the fish to turn into something amazing.
3836380	3840380	But just to let organic activity continue to take place.
3841380	3844380	And part of that is the bandwidth,
3844380	3846380	the various technological things
3846380	3848380	that are kind of boring to talk and think about.
3848380	3851380	But as we've been doing the live stream,
3851380	3855380	I've just been seeing a potential to complete a feedback circuit
3855380	3858380	where the people that are watching the show
3858380	3863380	can be reacting to the odd thing that we throw up,
3863380	3866380	whether it's a chart that the audience made.
3866380	3868380	I don't really want to get it.
3868380	3871380	I'm going to sound like I'm pitching some dumb show.
3871380	3874380	You have me a feedback circuit.
3874380	3876380	That's where you lost me.
3876380	3880380	Right now what we have is the ability to show the people at home.
3880380	3883380	If we gave Chris Baruff a photo ahead of time,
3883380	3885380	I could go, cut to that photo.
3885380	3888380	I need Roger, sir. I need cut to that photo.
3888380	3890380	I want to get to a place where we can go.
3891380	3893380	But I took a picture of this lady at the bank.
3893380	3894380	That's a bad example.
3894380	3897380	I'm going to harass some lady at the bank.
3897380	3900380	There's a picture of my dog pissing on my girlfriend's feet.
3900380	3901380	Pull it up.
3901380	3903380	That's a better example.
3903380	3906380	And then everyone's looking at it at the same time.
3906380	3911380	It's just sort of graduating us from viewer access cable
3911380	3914380	to late night cable talk.
3914380	3916380	Having shot three seasons of a TV show here,
3916380	3919380	I can say that it has its limitations for sure.
3919380	3921380	We brought in extra generators.
3921380	3923380	We had to bring in stuff just to keep it going.
3923380	3924380	For sure.
3924380	3927380	You had to bring in a cricket assassin to get rid of the cricket.
3927380	3928380	We didn't. We left the cricket in.
3928380	3929380	You left the cricket?
3929380	3930380	You can't.
3930380	3932380	Literally, you could look for the cricket for years.
3932380	3933380	There's no way to find that cricket.
3933380	3934380	They're in the ceiling.
3934380	3936380	How long do crickets live?
3936380	3939380	It's definitely like the great grandchild of whatever cricket it was.
3939380	3942380	Oh, it's like the Phantom, like it gets passed on.
3942380	3944380	That was... God damn it.
3944380	3946380	Are you mad at yourself for that one?
3946380	3948380	Nobody knows the Phantom.
3948380	3951380	You talking Billy Zane, slam evil, Phantom?
3951380	3954380	Yeah, but I'm talking about like the comic strip.
3954380	3955380	Oh, okay.
3955380	3958380	I thought you were maybe Robert England, Phantom of the Mall kind of...
3958380	3960380	No, no, no, but I am talking about that Phantom.
3960380	3963380	The good news, Spencer, at The New Space,
3963380	3965380	your table's going to be farther away and lower.
3965380	3967380	And I think farther behind everybody.
3967380	3969380	They're going to dig a pit?
3969380	3971380	You won't have a mic.
3971380	3973380	We'll just know you're there.
3973380	3975380	I'm learning a semaphore.
3975380	3977380	Is that what it's called?
3977380	3981380	Hey, when somebody asks you if something's in their teeth
3981380	3983380	and they go like this...
3983380	3986380	And they thereby reveal that they have so much confidence in their teeth
3986380	3988380	to begin with.
3988380	3990380	Like they're just like, do I have something in my teeth?
3990380	3991380	And I go...
3991380	3993380	And it's like, whoa.
3993380	3995380	They do or they don't, but in case they have beautiful teeth.
3995380	3996380	Your teeth are hideous, no matter what.
3996380	3998380	And I go like, no, you don't have anything in your teeth.
3998380	4001380	And then I'm like, well, I could have a million things in my teeth.
4001380	4003380	But whether I do or don't, my teeth are gross.
4003380	4005380	I will never go like this for anybody.
4005380	4006380	You've done it four times just now.
4006380	4007380	That's true.
4007380	4008380	Well, I'm doing it for...
4008380	4009380	You know, now it's for...
4009380	4010380	As long as it's for entertainment.
4010380	4012380	You think your teeth are gross?
4012380	4013380	I think my teeth are gross.
4013380	4015380	That's something I've never heard anyone say.
4015380	4017380	And I know a lot of people who hate themselves.
4017380	4019380	My teeth look like the 70s Hulk teeth.
4019380	4020380	Like they're yellow.
4020380	4021380	They're just yellow teeth.
4021380	4023380	Ah, Hulk smash.
4023380	4024380	Yeah, my teeth are yellow.
4024380	4028380	I think a lot of people get or not get confidence from teeth.
4028380	4030380	What are you saying, Brandon?
4030380	4032380	Oh, I love my teeth.
4032380	4033380	I also hate that move.
4033380	4034380	When people do that...
4034380	4035380	I don't want to move.
4035380	4036380	No, no, no.
4036380	4037380	I'm just saying.
4037380	4038380	I get the same reaction.
4038380	4039380	Yeah.
4039380	4040380	It just...
4040380	4041380	The other person is fine.
4041380	4043380	They've got beautiful teeth.
4043380	4045380	But then I'm just like, oh my God.
4045380	4047380	My own teeth are in my teeth.
4047380	4048380	Always.
4048380	4049380	It doesn't matter.
4049380	4051380	Take a napkin and I go like this.
4051380	4056380	I'm not going to let them in on my mouth.
4056380	4058380	I look like a monster.
4058380	4062880	It's hard to live in Los Angeles because people all have beautiful, cosmetic, thousands of
4062880	4063880	dollar mouths.
4063880	4064880	My feet...
4064880	4067880	This is the thing is that if you see them in a headshot, it's like, man, that person...
4067880	4068880	Oh, really?
4068880	4069880	I hate feet so much.
4069880	4073880	Like people that share their feet on their headshot, they're like, look at me.
4073880	4075880	Hey, Emily.
4075880	4079880	Emily, do I have something in my toes right now?
4079880	4081880	I feel good about my feet.
4081880	4085880	I feel pretty confident in my feet, but I don't with my teeth.
4085880	4087880	Even though I've had...
4087880	4093520	We started going to a dentist who was great, and then they got bought by a cosmetic dentist
4093520	4094520	person.
4094520	4095520	Yeah.
4095520	4096520	So now they're all different.
4096520	4097520	They're like, do you think...
4097520	4100520	He told me that my teeth were jacked up.
4100520	4101520	Jacked up?
4101520	4104520	I've been going to this place for years and they were like, great.
4104520	4106520	And they were like, oh, your teeth are great.
4106520	4107520	Great checkup.
4107520	4109520	And then I went in and they were like, well, we have this new odor.
4109520	4111520	And this new doctor came in and he was like, your teeth are jacked up.
4111520	4114520	And I was like, that's not nice.
4114520	4117520	But I did let them talk me into getting my teeth whitened with a laser.
4117520	4120520	The most painful thing I've ever had done in my life.
4120520	4121520	And I had lung surgery.
4121520	4122520	And it weakens your teeth.
4122520	4125520	So it's beautiful, but they're more likely to chip.
4125520	4128520	Yeah, they're whitening them by shaving off a layer of yellow tooth.
4128520	4131520	And for days afterwards, I would get these pains.
4131520	4132520	I would just do that.
4132520	4133520	Well, she really would.
4133520	4135520	It would be like, ah!
4135520	4138520	It was like you, but with no bug in the hair.
4138520	4139520	She really was.
4139520	4141520	I'm very confident in my teeth cavity-wise.
4141520	4144520	I could go to the dentist and they go like, oh, you don't have any cavities and stuff.
4144520	4147520	But they look like little kernels of gnarled corn.
4147520	4149520	You got to see movies from the 70s though.
4149520	4150520	That's so true.
4150520	4151520	Because Jesus.
4151520	4152520	Yeah, those teeth are fucked up.
4152520	4154520	And they put white pancake.
4154520	4155520	Wicker man?
4155520	4156520	I was like, whoa.
4156520	4159520	If you put white pancake makeup on a woman, yeah.
4159520	4161520	Yeah, why is it like that?
4161520	4163520	Why is that stereotype like true?
4163520	4166520	Because of World War II, they had no fluoride.
4166520	4167520	There was lack of vitamins.
4167520	4170520	And so teeth weren't really a priority.
4170520	4172520	Children were raised with no vitamins.
4172520	4174520	And the teeth were really weak.
4174520	4177520	So laugh it up.
4177520	4178520	Wow.
4178520	4182520	But why does that go down to our British friends who are younger than us?
4182520	4185520	Shouldn't they have fluoride by now?
4185520	4188520	I think they just gave up.
4188520	4192520	They just found out, well, hey, man, you could be fucking James Bond and not give a fuck.
4192520	4193520	And it turns out you don't need it.
4193520	4194520	Yeah.
4194520	4195520	Well, yeah.
4195520	4196520	I mean, it's only a cosmetic thing.
4196520	4201520	I just find myself thinking about teeth when I see some of the beautiful gleaming teeth.
4201520	4202520	Chocolate teeth, though.
4202520	4203520	Sometimes they look fake.
4203520	4209520	And by the way, dentists, look, there's a ton of really quality.
4209520	4210520	It's just like cops.
4210520	4214520	There's probably more good dentists than bad dentists.
4214520	4219520	But it is like a very, if you want to be corrupt and work anywhere near medicine, dentistry
4219520	4224520	is like, Erin McGathey worked for 1-800-Dentists.
4224520	4227520	And she, I don't know, am I getting her in trouble?
4227520	4228520	No, you're good.
4228520	4230520	I think she must have talked about it.
4230520	4236520	It was like the corruption that they just tell old ladies, you need veneers.
4236520	4240520	And they take their social security money and stuff.
4240520	4242520	I just remembered that she gave me her email address once.
4242520	4245520	And it was like, Erin at 1-800-Dentists.
4245520	4248520	And I was like, you sure about this one?
4248520	4249520	You just gave her email address.
4249520	4251520	I don't think she uses it anymore.
4251520	4252520	Try email or see what happens.
4252520	4253520	Wow.
4253520	4255520	But yeah, that's a fucked up industry.
4255520	4256520	Yeah.
4256520	4262520	I was like, this dentist then to me would be like, yeah, if I did this, your smile
4262520	4263520	would be better.
4263520	4264520	I was like, what?
4264520	4265520	Fuck you.
4265520	4266520	The perfect smile.
4266520	4269520	See, I like my dentist.
4269520	4273520	My front teeth are kind of, the front two go in because a baseball hit me when I was
4273520	4274520	a kid.
4274520	4276520	And this one over here jags out because I...
4276520	4278520	I kind of have that too.
4278520	4282520	That one sticks out because Diana Madawose and my sophomore year of high school at Not
4282520	4285520	Scary Farm ran into me at a haunted house.
4285520	4287520	And she knocked my tooth up into my head.
4287520	4289520	So this one sticks out and goes up a bit.
4289520	4291140	It didn't hurt her at all.
4291140	4294520	She moved my tooth into my brain and she didn't get a nick.
4294520	4295520	What part of her body did that?
4295520	4296520	The top of her head.
4296520	4297520	Oh, God.
4297520	4300560	You would think that would cut a person.
4300560	4301960	She was dazed, but fine.
4301960	4303720	My tooth went, nope.
4303720	4308760	And so just like last week I went to the dentist and they gave me an x-ray, like this like
4308760	4311520	super duper Tron x-ray where you can stick a...
4311520	4312520	I saw you posted it.
4312520	4313520	Yeah.
4313520	4314520	It was weird.
4314520	4315520	It's really weird.
4315520	4317520	It was like a 3D rendering of your head.
4317520	4318520	A 3D thing.
4318520	4319520	And they're like, okay, that...
4319520	4323520	You might have a future abscess on this one tooth right there.
4323520	4325520	I go, the one that sticks out?
4325520	4326520	That one here?
4326520	4327520	I go, yeah.
4327520	4330520	I said, well, I got hit there really hard once.
4330520	4332520	And they go, okay, that might be trauma.
4332520	4333520	Maybe that's why.
4333520	4336520	But it might be an abscess in the future, but...
4336520	4339520	Wait, are they like pre-cods about tooth?
4339520	4343520	Well, they're saying that they saw like a little dark spot above that tooth.
4343520	4345520	I go, well, that's the one that sticks up there.
4345520	4348520	This dark up there, I said, well, I got nailed there a long time ago.
4348520	4351520	And they go, oh, that could just be trauma.
4351520	4353520	You might be fine.
4353520	4355520	Or you might need $50,000 surgery.
4355520	4358520	Yeah, but one of my doctors said, you know, if you want, because you're an actor, like
4358520	4360520	we can have that straightened up for you.
4360520	4363520	And the women that clean their teeth, they're like, don't do it.
4363520	4365520	Like leave your teeth weird.
4365520	4366520	Yeah.
4366520	4367520	Like leave your teeth weird.
4367520	4368520	Leave your teeth weird.
4368520	4369520	Yeah.
4369520	4370520	Almost always.
4370520	4372520	Perfect teeth are a little dreary, a little dull.
4372520	4373520	But you notice...
4373520	4377520	I don't know, but sometimes you see someone with perfect teeth and you're like, that looks great.
4377520	4378520	There's like a hot...
4378520	4379520	There's like a...
4379520	4380520	It's true.
4380520	4382520	Like sometimes I'll have a friend who you...
4382520	4384520	He said, I'm going to go get my teeth straightened.
4384520	4385520	Why not like don't do it?
4385520	4386520	Don't do it.
4386520	4387520	And then they come back the next week.
4387520	4388520	You're like, you look great.
4388520	4389520	Yeah.
4389520	4390520	It's like a hotening.
4390520	4392520	I think it happens to actors actually more than actresses.
4392520	4394520	But if you go back and look at...
4394520	4396520	What's Jesse from Breaking Bad?
4396520	4397520	Aaron Paul.
4397520	4399520	If you look at him early, he's like...
4399520	4401520	A guy, if you saw him on the street, you'd be like, all right, fine.
4401520	4403520	They did something to him.
4403520	4405520	It happened to Jake Gyllenhaal too.
4405520	4406520	He used to be a weird looking little dude.
4406520	4410520	And then at some point they just like put him in a machine and he came out like a hot actor.
4410520	4412520	They have a Captain America machine that they found.
4412520	4413520	Yeah, exactly.
4413520	4415520	Well, it's definitely Chris Pratt.
4415520	4416520	Oh, yeah.
4416520	4417520	What happened to Chris Pratt?
4417520	4421520	He just went into settings and like changed some sliders and now...
4421520	4423520	He looks like a fucking superstar.
4423520	4426520	But it starts with your teeth and then somehow your eyes get whiter.
4426520	4428520	Like they do a bunch of things, huh?
4429520	4430520	Yeah.
4432520	4434520	The winner of all is Tom Cruise.
4434520	4435520	That's right.
4435520	4437520	He fucking had his front tooth over a year.
4437520	4440520	And Top Gun, his teeth are like real...
4440520	4444520	But then he was famous for being handsome for a while and it was part of his personality.
4444520	4447520	He was the most handsome guy in the world, hands down.
4447520	4449520	But have you seen him?
4449520	4450520	The most...
4450520	4452520	He's got a balloon head.
4452520	4454520	He looks so weird.
4454520	4456520	I'm on Tom Cruise's side.
4456520	4457520	Robert Redford.
4457520	4459520	Tom Cruise doesn't look weird.
4459520	4460520	What do you mean?
4460520	4461520	He's done...
4461520	4462520	He did something.
4462520	4463520	He's got a balloon head.
4463520	4464520	It's like a head spread.
4464520	4467520	It's that we go years between seeing him.
4467520	4469520	So the next time we see him, he's like three years old.
4469520	4472520	But he does have some Scientology stuff going on.
4472520	4473520	For sure.
4473520	4475520	It was the second Jack Reacher thing.
4475520	4479520	Scientology, what the Scientology puts puffer fish in his face?
4479520	4483520	No, they use bats that are like...
4483520	4487520	They're illegal, but they're like stem cell face washes.
4487520	4488520	I'm not joking.
4488520	4489520	What?
4489520	4490520	Yeah.
4490520	4491520	They're ruining Tom Cruise.
4491520	4492520	I mean, I'd like to see him get old.
4492520	4493520	I'd like to watch him get old.
4493520	4494520	They're already ruining Tom Cruise.
4494520	4496520	But I think it's like when wrinkles start, they want to like...
4496520	4497520	You got to fill them in.
4497520	4500520	And if you have a balloon that's like losing air, you blow it back up.
4500520	4501520	You know what I mean?
4501520	4502520	Like that's what they're doing.
4502520	4503520	Stem cell baths?
4503520	4505520	There's a bath of stem cells?
4505520	4506520	I'm telling you.
4506520	4507520	Are you getting your phone out?
4507520	4509520	There's a face thing you can get with stem cells.
4509520	4510520	Camille's getting it.
4510520	4511520	He ordered them on Amazon.
4511520	4514520	Yeah, I got hand wash.
4514520	4515520	Stem cell...
4515520	4516520	Next to the...
4516520	4517520	Face.
4517520	4518520	I like any...
4518520	4520520	You can get a stem cell facelift.
4520520	4521520	There you go.
4521520	4522520	But that's just the facelift.
4522520	4530520	Any famous actress or especially actress, the criteria is so demanding to be perfect
4530520	4531520	in every possible way.
4531520	4532520	Oh, yeah.
4532520	4536520	When you see somebody famous with flawed teeth or a wonky nose that goes a little bit this
4536520	4540520	way or something unusual and something asymmetrical.
4540520	4541520	That's sexy.
4541520	4543520	Like Ryan Gosling's wonky?
4543520	4544520	Whoa.
4544520	4545520	Oh, I'm sorry?
4545520	4546520	What are you talking about?
4546520	4547520	He has like a weird eye.
4547520	4548520	No, that wonky.
4548520	4549520	He has a little tiny wonky eye.
4549520	4552520	Why does the show always get so shallow when you come on it?
4552520	4555520	Emily Gordon, you drag the show into the...
4555520	4559520	It's important as you're talking about his teeth's attractiveness.
4559520	4560520	Yeah.
4560520	4565520	She wrote a book just for Ryan Gosling about how to have higher self-esteem.
4565520	4570520	Just look in the mirror.
4570520	4574520	It is weird the line between the stuff that we would do or not do.
4574520	4578520	Like what qualifies as like dishonesty and honesty.
4578520	4579520	Yeah.
4579520	4587520	For men, if we start losing our hair, if we seek to do something to make it look as if
4587520	4593520	we still have it, there's a stigma there that's like, well, it's a zero-sum game.
4593520	4596520	You get away with it or you're a horrible person for trying.
4596520	4598520	You got to start early.
4598520	4602520	And so you got to go to either side of the place.
4602520	4606520	It's like, you know, I've known Shrava for 25 years?
4606520	4607520	Jesus Christ.
4607520	4609520	I met you when you were 18.
4609520	4611520	He was bald when I met him.
4611520	4612520	Yeah.
4612520	4615520	Like he was just out of college and so I got to...
4615520	4620520	Shravas looked the same for 25 years.
4620520	4621520	No, no.
4621520	4624520	If you find a photo of him with any hair, it's so gross.
4624520	4625520	You want to puke.
4625520	4626520	What was your hair like?
4626520	4627520	I agree.
4627520	4628520	What was your hair like?
4628520	4629520	What was I hair like?
4629520	4630520	What was your hair like?
4630520	4635520	It was like parted down the middle and feathered back.
4635520	4637520	Like my Mass Effect character.
4637520	4638520	Yeah.
4638520	4641520	Anyways, whatever.
4641520	4643520	It's interesting the stuff.
4643520	4645520	Part just kept getting bigger.
4645520	4649520	Every part of your body that has anything to do with...
4649520	4652520	Well, humanity, because all of it will have to do with aging.
4652520	4656520	It's like we have a tarot card for every single part of our body.
4656520	4658520	Like, oh, I just had some handwork done.
4658520	4660520	There's no stigma against that.
4660520	4661520	Right.
4661520	4664520	I don't think there's a stigma against if you get hair transplants.
4664520	4670520	Like you said, if it's not super obvious, I feel like everybody gets hair transplants now.
4670520	4676520	I feel like I'd rather have Jude Law with hair than Jude Law without hair.
4676520	4681520	But it sucks for Jude Law because he just missed it by like 10 years.
4681520	4682520	You know what I mean?
4682520	4683520	But he's killing it with hair.
4683520	4684520	Same thing happened to him.
4684520	4685520	He's a young pope.
4685520	4686520	He's a young Dumbledore.
4686520	4691520	The weird thing about it, though, is that what is it that we want?
4691520	4693520	We walk this weird line when we...
4693520	4695520	Even before we have a conversation about it with anybody,
4695520	4699520	our perceptions walk this strange razor-thin line
4699520	4701520	where we're perceiving another person.
4701520	4707520	We want them to have been perfect.
4707520	4713520	So we'll hold it against them if they've done something to pretend to be perfect.
4713520	4716520	But if that something is working out for eight hours a day,
4716520	4718520	they're the best fucking person in the world.
4718520	4722520	But if they have no control over it, we don't give up.
4722520	4723520	If you're born...
4723520	4724520	You're genetic to bad.
4724520	4727520	It's just so weird the things we hold against people and we don't.
4727520	4730520	Working out's okay, but if you're losing your hair,
4730520	4732520	which you have no control over,
4732520	4735520	and you do something to obviously get your hair...
4735520	4736520	Yeah, we've never...
4736520	4740520	I don't know what it is, but now I just started...
4740520	4742520	I take a picture in the back of my head,
4742520	4744520	or I'll see something in the back of my head.
4744520	4746520	I'm going, oh, God, it's such a shock.
4746520	4750520	But it's just because, oh, I didn't expect that to look that way.
4750520	4752520	I didn't expect to see my scalp so much.
4752520	4755520	And all it is is just, I wanted more control over this.
4755520	4758520	I wanted to be like the elves in the Tolkien universe.
4759520	4764520	Decide after a great debate at Rivendell that it's time to proceed.
4765520	4770520	I was never going to do anything with my sexy mane of flowing hair,
4770520	4775520	but you just see anything that reminds you of the passage of time
4775520	4779520	and you freak out and you want to scrub it away.
4779520	4783520	But we all have friends that have horror stories of stuff that they've tried done
4783520	4787520	and they come back and they hate themselves even more.
4787520	4791520	But there's probably some stories in there of people that just had a grand old time
4791520	4793520	that are just like, oh, had you heard of...
4793520	4796520	Hey, Kyle, you look amazing. I can't figure out what it is.
4796520	4797520	I haven't seen you in six years.
4797520	4800520	The truth, I had my lobes swapped.
4800520	4801520	What?
4801520	4803520	Yeah, no one ever...
4803520	4806520	Look, you guys are my friends, but I've always had weird lobes.
4806520	4807520	I swapped them.
4807520	4809520	My left lobe is my right lobe now.
4809520	4810520	And you're like, I'll be goddamn!
4810520	4812520	You look amazing!
4812520	4813520	And he's like, yay!
4813520	4816520	And there's a cake in the shape of an ear and everyone's so happy.
4816520	4819520	I thought that he had them swapped with another person,
4819520	4821520	but he just had them swapped with himself.
4821520	4822520	That's fine.
4822520	4823520	They were on wrong.
4823520	4824520	That I'm fine with.
4824520	4827520	But if it's another person, that's too vain.
4827520	4830520	Yeah. Oh, and for God's sakes, Jane's sitting in the front row
4830520	4836520	where all advocates of the trans community, these are folks doing work.
4836520	4838520	It's work that's allowed.
4838520	4840520	It's not like, oh, have you heard?
4840520	4841520	What a vain piece of shit.
4841520	4844520	They decided they were born in a different gender body.
4844520	4847520	So shallow.
4847520	4848520	I don't know.
4848520	4849520	What is my point?
4849520	4850520	We're all going to die.
4850520	4851520	We're all going to die.
4851520	4854520	Kumail and Emily, you guys said you had a hard out.
4854520	4855520	Yeah, we have to go.
4855520	4857520	Can we plug our movie before we go?
4857520	4858520	Of course, yes.
4858520	4859520	Hey.
4859520	4861520	It's called Kumail.
4861520	4862520	You've got Kumail.
4862520	4866520	It's got, yeah.
4866520	4868520	That would have been a good title.
4868520	4870520	That would have been a good title.
4870520	4873520	And you can watch it with all your Emily.
4874520	4877520	Oh, that joke is not in the movie.
4877520	4878520	Let's take that out.
4878520	4879520	It's called The Big Sick.
4879520	4880520	Called The Big Sick.
4880520	4884520	It comes out June 23rd in select cities in July 14th everywhere.
4884520	4889520	So just remember the date for the Planet of the Apes movie coming out.
4889520	4890520	That's when we come out.
4890520	4894520	And if you really want to see Apes buy a ticket to our movie, sneak the fuck in.
4894520	4895520	Go see Apes.
4895520	4896520	Nobody wants to see a movie about Apes.
4896520	4898520	You want to see The Big Sick?
4898520	4901520	The Big Sick.
4902520	4903520	Kumail Nanziani.
4903520	4905520	Thank you so much.
4906520	4907520	Thank you.
4907520	4909520	I'll see you in the new space.
4909520	4910520	Bye.
4910520	4911520	Thank you for inviting me.
4911520	4912520	Emily, the reason for us.
4912520	4913520	Vision.
4914520	4915520	Happy Easter.
4915520	4916520	The resurrection.
4926520	4928520	Let's bring out Doug Benson, everybody.
4928520	4929520	Doug Benson.
4932520	4933520	That's right.
4936520	4939520	You thought Emily and Kumail couldn't be replaced by one man.
4945520	4947520	Don't think it was losing a Kumail and an Emily.
4947520	4949520	Think of his gaining a Benson.
4951520	4952520	You can just grab your hand.
4952520	4953520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4953520	4956520	I was so excited about the tongs and then...
4956520	4960520	Doug made a beeline straight from the ice bucket, filling up the red solo cup.
4960520	4966520	I almost came in a few times before you introduced me just to get some ice for my drink.
4967520	4971520	I've never heard of taking the ice bucket from the green room to on stage,
4972520	4975520	excluding those of us who are not on stage yet.
4975520	4976520	I'm sorry.
4976520	4977520	Hey.
4977520	4978520	Hey, dude.
4978520	4979520	Good to see you, buddy.
4979520	4980520	How you doing?
4981520	4982520	Hey, Doug, what it is, man?
4982520	4983520	What's going down?
4983520	4985520	Oh, you know, I was just hanging out.
4985520	4987520	There was Emily and Kumail were out here.
4988520	4990520	I thought of a good one.
4990520	4991520	You've got Kumail.
4991520	4992520	It was really good.
4992520	4997520	I thought of Kumail Lificent would be a good hybrid.
4997520	4998520	Kumangi?
4998520	5001520	Oh, I like Kumangi.
5002520	5004520	It's autobiographical, their movie.
5004520	5006520	It's a little indie movie.
5006520	5007520	Yeah.
5007520	5012520	It's a little indie movie that's autobiographical as opposed to a giant blockbuster that's autobiographical.
5012520	5013520	But it kind of...
5013520	5015520	It's about a world where apes take over the world, right?
5016520	5019520	It's inspired by their relationship or how it began, the quirky...
5019520	5021520	It's crazy how good it is.
5021520	5022520	Have you seen it?
5022520	5023520	Yeah.
5023520	5028520	It's really amazing how, like, it's almost like they made a movie with science.
5030520	5033520	But it's still about the heart, though.
5033520	5034520	It's still got...
5034520	5035520	I can't...
5035520	5037520	It's still very moving.
5037520	5038520	Doug?
5038520	5039520	Doug?
5039520	5040520	It's a very moving experience, but it's...
5040520	5041520	Doug.
5041520	5042520	Doug.
5042520	5043520	Every joke lands.
5043520	5044520	It's so funny.
5044520	5045520	It is.
5045520	5047520	You've never seen the movie, have you?
5047520	5051520	No, I saw it at South by Southwest where I'm pretty sure I saw you guys.
5051520	5052520	Yeah, yeah.
5053520	5054520	All right.
5054520	5055520	Well, so it is good.
5055520	5057520	Your story checks out.
5057520	5061520	So here's some things that aren't good.
5062520	5070520	Has anybody been watching the Lifetime original miniseries Lizzie Borden 2?
5071520	5075520	It's like a reprise of the Lizzie Borden thing with Christina Ricci.
5075520	5077520	But it's like they did it again.
5077520	5080520	I guess they did a movie, and then they...
5080520	5082520	I tried to watch the...
5082520	5083520	It's rough.
5083520	5087520	It's like a sound-alike Black Keys soundtrack.
5087520	5092520	They do that thing where it's like a period piece, but it's like dirty, like, harmonica,
5092520	5094520	rock and roll kind of like...
5096520	5097520	Evil woman.
5097520	5100520	Like while they're riding covered wagons, it's like...
5101520	5102520	Barf.
5102520	5103520	Barf.
5104520	5109520	Dan, are you trying to use all the words right now because you were saying a lot of things.
5110520	5115520	I don't know where I'm supposed to jump in or if any of us are supposed to do anything.
5115520	5118520	I don't know when these guys are going to say the scores.
5118520	5119520	Yeah.
5120520	5123520	When are they going to do some color or some updates?
5123520	5126520	Let it wash over you like a tidal wave.
5126520	5128520	I was wondering when you showed up tonight.
5128520	5131520	I was like, we'll have Doug come in after Camille and Emily leaves.
5131520	5135520	So I'll be blackout drunk and he'll be so high it's amazing.
5135520	5139520	And then they'll be perfect communication between us.
5139520	5142520	When worlds could have maybe collided.
5142520	5145520	But missed each other by a barn width.
5149520	5151520	Yeah, let's check in with these guys.
5151520	5153520	But I'll drink it just to try to fit in.
5154520	5155520	Look at these guys.
5155520	5156520	We changed places.
5156520	5157520	It looks better.
5157520	5158520	Yay.
5159520	5160520	It's 9.36.
5161520	5166520	Yeah, I wanted to bring like, you know, a little bit of flavor to the second half of the show.
5166520	5167520	You know, it'd be funny.
5167520	5170520	We should have done a bit when we found out we had too much show.
5170520	5176520	We should have thrown together a bit where like police came out and like did a lottery
5176520	5179520	and selected someone for voluntary removal.
5179520	5180520	No.
5180520	5181520	And then dragged them off.
5184520	5185520	It would have been funny.
5186520	5187520	Hey, Brandon.
5187520	5188520	Brandon.
5188520	5189520	It's only a bit.
5189520	5190520	Yeah.
5190520	5191520	Until we get to the police car.
5192520	5193520	And then the jail.
5193520	5194520	And then the judge.
5194520	5195520	Ha, ha, ha.
5195520	5196520	Did you guys see the thing?
5197520	5201520	It's so funny that it has to be like a Photoshop fake thing.
5201520	5208520	But it was like the United app updated and somebody was doing it.
5208520	5214520	And it was somebody retweeted the snap of the United apps update where it says like new features.
5215520	5216520	Drag and drop feature.
5217520	5218520	It can't be.
5218520	5221520	It has to be like just a Photoshop bit.
5221520	5222520	But it was so perfect.
5223520	5224520	They didn't drop that guy.
5224520	5225520	They dragged him though.
5226520	5232520	Do you guys ever get so angry at society that you're actually you actually get experience pleasure at something like that?
5232520	5234520	Like like like just be deeply confessional.
5234520	5237520	Don't fucking high road me you millennial shitbags.
5238520	5240520	I will say value my candor.
5241520	5244520	I will say that flying a lot made me jump to the.
5245520	5252520	Sure this guy was being treated poorly but when they said get off our plane and he said no I'm not getting off the plane.
5252520	5267520	He wasn't taking into account all the people on that plane were now going to leave two hours later and the next plane that was going to take off when that plane got to where it was going to go is taking off hours later like the longer that guy sat there and resisted getting off.
5267520	5271520	The more people he was inconveniencing through his behavior.
5271520	5272520	Right.
5272520	5274520	But but you're right.
5274520	5278520	They shouldn't oversell the airplane but that's what they do.
5278520	5281520	So when somebody comes in and says you have to get off now.
5281520	5286520	But they but they spent that entire time saying we'll give you an eight hundred dollar rebate and all this math.
5286520	5289520	Yeah they could have easily could have kept going higher.
5289520	5295520	But some asshole decided let's stop it there because we're doing a great job.
5296520	5298520	I don't know why they even try to do that.
5298520	5299520	I don't know why.
5299520	5300520	So maybe we agree.
5300520	5301520	Yeah I think so.
5301520	5312520	I thought you were throwing the guy that got beaten half to death under the bus and going like why didn't that guy consider the needs of I am saying that when someone with a badge says to get off of this plane.
5312520	5314520	Unfortunately you have to get off the plane.
5314520	5315520	Fuck that.
5316520	5322520	Because because because at that point that's when it's going to get ugly instead of working it out.
5322520	5324520	It's important that it got ugly though.
5324520	5326520	I mean I don't think it was what they should have said.
5326520	5327520	Fuck it.
5327520	5328520	Two thousand five thousand.
5328520	5329520	Eventually it's going to go.
5329520	5331520	Ten thousand like the highest bidder.
5331520	5332520	They lost so much stock.
5332520	5333520	What if he went.
5333520	5336520	It was stupid not to just keep driving it off for nine hundred.
5336520	5340520	If somebody next to him goes I'll get off for nine hundred dollars.
5340520	5342520	Well Congress at the limit.
5342520	5345520	Congress actually set the limit at thirteen fifty thirteen seventy five.
5345520	5346520	Something like that.
5347520	5350520	That could have easily been a really funny bit.
5350520	5352520	You had that twinkle in your eye.
5352520	5353520	Really.
5353520	5355520	Thirteen hundred thirteen seventy five.
5355520	5358520	You were here forty forty forty forty forty forty five.
5358520	5360520	I got fifteen hundred over there.
5360520	5361520	Sixteen.
5361520	5365520	But they did have to set a limit because the shit did pop off so much.
5365520	5369520	So the truth of the matter is they should have had him up at like twelve.
5369520	5370520	They should have gone to the limit before.
5370520	5374520	But he still wouldn't have gone and it's very important to him to get home for some reason.
5374520	5375520	I'm sorry I'm sorry I grabbed this thing.
5375520	5376520	It was because I was grabbing this thing.
5376520	5377520	Holy shit.
5377520	5378520	What is that thing?
5378520	5379520	I just wanted to say it.
5379520	5382520	How many gigawatts does that go up to?
5382520	5386520	Maybe you shouldn't overbook your flights.
5386520	5387520	Because here's the thing.
5387520	5388520	Right.
5388520	5390520	Why is that a business practice?
5390520	5393520	Because a lot of people don't show up for flights and then they make that money.
5393520	5395520	And then they make that.
5395520	5396520	I don't know.
5396520	5397520	Money.
5397520	5400520	Then they make that money with an empty seat.
5400520	5408520	But they have chosen to regard an empty seat and free money as lost money because that
5408520	5409520	could have been another person.
5409520	5410520	Absolutely.
5410520	5415520	And so every Christmas they go, uh, ladies and gentlemen, just to remind you, we do have
5415520	5416520	a full flight.
5416520	5418520	No idea how the fuck that happened.
5418520	5419520	You motherfucker.
5419520	5420520	You.
5420520	5421520	You're greed.
5421520	5422520	You're endless.
5422520	5423520	Bottomless greed.
5423520	5424520	Yay.
5424520	5428520	I've been yelling about this forever.
5428520	5432520	Wait, but here's what happens Dan.
5432520	5436520	Here's what happens when they're not allowed to overbook flights anymore.
5436520	5440520	Well, they go out of business because they're so accountable to the laws of capitalism.
5440520	5443520	No, they, they raise the ticket prices.
5443520	5447520	It's going to cost us money that they can't do that anymore.
5447520	5450520	It's just one situation got fucking out of hand.
5450520	5454520	It takes one intransigent Chinese doctor to fuck it for the whole group.
5454520	5457520	I don't know how intransigent he was.
5457520	5459520	He likes to wear a panties on his head.
5459520	5462520	Well, his past has nothing to do with what happened there.
5462520	5465520	That turned out to be fake was a, it was just racism.
5465520	5468520	It was some other guy with the same Asian sounding name.
5468520	5470520	And they're like, must be the guy.
5470520	5472520	Listen, by the way, they hadn't gotten a statement.
5472520	5473520	They didn't know who the guy was.
5473520	5475520	And I don't even know who that guy was.
5475520	5478520	But the first thing I thought when I heard his accent and I saw, and he's blood trickling
5478520	5480520	down and he was going like, just kill me, just kill me.
5480520	5481520	I want to go home.
5481520	5486520	I'm like, look, like, like, like, maybe this is, maybe this is also kind of racist of me.
5486520	5491520	Maybe it's like, like the right kind of racism where I'm like, you don't know when you hold
5491520	5497520	a lottery on a, yes, the right kind of racism, i.e. consciousness of the possibility of anybody
5497520	5498520	being from anywhere.
5498520	5499520	Yeah.
5499520	5500520	They were throwing him off because he was Asian.
5500520	5504520	Well, no, but I'm saying like, you don't know on an international flight.
5504520	5508520	You don't know when you're, when you're saying, oh, let's hold a lottery and then let's go
5508520	5509520	up to somebody.
5509520	5512520	Like I didn't, I was like, do we know about that guy's life?
5512520	5517520	Like, like what trauma he's endured or his parents or whatever, like he could be from
5517520	5522520	anywhere where when that happens, it means you're fucking dead or it's like emotionally.
5522520	5525520	I don't mean like he's like bulky and perfect strangers and he doesn't understand.
5525520	5526520	He's a doctor.
5526520	5530520	He probably has critical thinking, but I'm saying emotionally he could, we could be traumatizing
5530520	5531520	the perfect strangers.
5531520	5538520	Anyone that guy also on the flight had so many bitty Bob because we tell people when
5538520	5543520	they get on an airplane that they're going past a threshold when they walk onto that
5543520	5544520	airplane.
5544520	5545520	We don't tell them.
5545520	5549520	We don't treat the threshold of crossing into that airplane like it's just going into a
5549520	5550520	bar.
5550520	5554520	So you can't bounce people because when you walk out of that airplane, you are told, you
5554520	5558520	are put, you are told the entire time when you're going through the fucking airport.
5558520	5562520	Like, okay, one more threshold at past this point, you're allowed to have your bag search.
5562520	5565520	Oh, this is so important for 30 minutes before boarding.
5565520	5567520	Don't forget, take off your shoes.
5567520	5570520	Oh, 95% of the guns get through in a test, but fuck it.
5570520	5571520	Whatever.
5571520	5573520	Hey, we redesigned this to be more convenient too.
5573520	5575520	I think the TSA people, I don't know.
5575520	5577520	These things don't give you cancer.
5577520	5580520	The guy that built them won't go through them, but he disappeared.
5580520	5584520	Just come to your gate and just do what you're told.
5584520	5588520	And you can't take your business elsewhere because you need to go to a destination and
5588520	5589520	they have a monopoly.
5589520	5591520	Okay, now you're walking down the hall.
5591520	5593520	Oh, class C citizens, go for class D plus.
5593520	5596520	Now welcoming our platinum plus, class plus, class plus.
5596520	5599520	I'm sorry, sir, you need to go back.
5599520	5600520	Oh, excuse me.
5600520	5602520	This lady jumped in front of me.
5602520	5603520	Everyone's just trying to get on the plane.
5603520	5608520	Oh, well, fuck me for buying a $500 fucking bonus platinum chip to go on my fucking ticket.
5608520	5609520	Whatever.
5609520	5610520	Like, oh, we're class citizens.
5610520	5612520	I'm class, class, class, class, class.
5612520	5614520	Going through the air vault.
5614520	5615520	Sir.
5615520	5618520	Ladies and gentlemen, just to remind you, we're going to keep proceeding to the back of this
5618520	5619520	airlock.
5619520	5620520	We're going to snap the bags into place.
5620520	5622520	You can't keep your laptop under this.
5622520	5623520	They buckle you in.
5623520	5630520	If they come up to you and say, hey, you've been selected to get the fuck off the plane,
5630520	5635520	I reserve the right, considering how everyone else on that plane dealt with the trauma of
5635520	5641520	watching it the way I would, which is to sit there and go, nice one.
5641520	5642520	Good job.
5642520	5645520	Pick on someone your own size.
5645520	5651520	Like, that might be my one recourse to heroism, is that I'm the guy that won't get off the
5651520	5652520	fucking plane.
5652520	5655520	And I don't want to think that I'm inconveniencing everybody at that point.
5655520	5658520	I'm going to be like, sorry, everybody.
5658520	5661520	Thanksgiving must be celebrating something.
5661520	5669520	I know you all want to get home to dinner with your families, but maybe this is Plymouth Rock.
5669520	5672520	I want to see what they do.
5672520	5675520	Maybe the plane will grow a third wing.
5675520	5680520	Maybe they'll admit they're a fucking cartel and an Alaskan Airlines jet will pull up and
5680520	5685520	have a magic tube gut and half the customers will get sucked aboard and everything will
5685520	5688520	turn out to be totally monopolized and price fixed.
5688520	5692520	Maybe they can drive their employees across the country.
5692520	5697520	Maybe they can offer $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000.
5697520	5700520	Maybe they should, maybe Holland Oats should come aboard.
5700520	5704520	Maybe the plane should turn into a submarine.
5704520	5706520	All I know is I have no control over it.
5706520	5708520	You don't want the plane to be a submarine.
5708520	5709520	That's bad because of that.
5709520	5712520	But did they, did they, did they taze their deck?
5712520	5713520	Airlines are too big.
5713520	5716520	There's too much going on.
5716520	5717520	I know.
5717520	5722520	But like, do those four or five people made the decision to do that to that guy.
5722520	5724520	It wasn't like, you know what I mean?
5724520	5729520	They were following like the corporate structure of the rules, but they could have kept offering
5729520	5730520	more money.
5730520	5731520	They stopped at $800.
5731520	5732520	They shouldn't.
5732520	5733520	They could have kept going.
5733520	5737520	But somebody was like, I'm going to be a good employee and save the company money and fuck
5737520	5743520	that person for like not just going to the limit to stop something like this from happening.
5743520	5747520	It would also be nice if the police officers didn't respond with some sort of corporate
5747520	5748520	hypnosis.
5748520	5749520	Right.
5749520	5751520	They just came in and just were like, yeah, we'll do it.
5751520	5752520	We'll just get this guy out of here.
5752520	5754520	And it's like, well, why?
5754520	5757520	So then when he ran back into the plane, does anyone, has anyone learned yet what happened
5757520	5762520	off camera that like, I think he just found his way back down the jet way, got on the
5762520	5765520	plane and was, but that is an important.
5765520	5766520	I thought you had him.
5767520	5770520	They dragged his lifeless body off the plane.
5770520	5775520	Well, I think you can file the end for not my department.
5775520	5776520	The cops go.
5776520	5777520	They dragged him off.
5777520	5778520	Yeah.
5778520	5780520	Oh, and then they're like, my job is to drag people off planes.
5780520	5783520	We got him off the plane and he wants to get back on.
5783520	5784520	That's his business.
5785520	5786520	I love that.
5787520	5788520	It's like Ghostbusters basement.
5788520	5789520	I'll do my job.
5789520	5790520	Pencil neck.
5790520	5791520	You do yours.
5791520	5792520	Templeton Peck.
5793520	5798520	Doug, Doug, it sounds like you have a lot of opinions about airplane travel.
5798520	5799520	Yeah.
5799520	5804520	About about justice, about about the criminal justice system, about the way that we enact
5804520	5807520	corporate power over the paying customer.
5807520	5808520	Yes.
5808520	5813520	Also, I think you, you know, Harmon town well enough to understand that now you are engaged
5813520	5816520	in a angry rap battle.
5816520	5817520	Oh, no.
5817520	5818520	Yes.
5818520	5819520	Oh, no.
5819520	5820520	Yes.
5820520	5823520	All I wanted to do when I get up here was not rap.
5823520	5826520	Well, and now I've brought on myself.
5826520	5831520	Sometimes a Chinese doctor just wants to get back to Louisville, Kentucky.
5831520	5834520	Oh, drop a beat.
5834520	5840520	Oh, you guys are groaning because you think he's using the outdated racist slur Chinese
5840520	5845520	doctor, which is what we used to call Italians.
5845520	5848520	That hasn't been a racist phrase since the 1860s.
5848520	5849520	Italian Americans are perfectly fine.
5849520	5852520	We don't call them Chinese doctors anymore.
5852520	5857520	Doug, Doug, you don't have to rap, but you certainly have to be here while it happens.
5857520	5858520	Okay.
5858520	5859520	Dan has a lot of shit to get off his chest.
5859520	5863520	I did want to announce to thank you to all our new subscribers who since we announced
5863520	5874520	it, by matching your sign up fees after we announced it, we raised $21,950 for the ACLU.
5874520	5876520	Oh, yeah.
5877520	5878520	An argument could be made.
5878520	5884520	We were slow on the uptake that the ACLU, they had a big windfall, but another argument
5884520	5885520	could be made.
5885520	5887520	I think money for the ACLU is like toilet paper.
5887520	5888520	I don't think it expires.
5888520	5893520	And I think it always gets used for something very important that we don't want to think
5893520	5898520	about a lot, even though I haven't joined yet and I haven't watched fucking Atlanta.
5898520	5901520	I need to join the ACLU and watch fucking Atlanta.
5901520	5902520	Come on.
5902520	5903520	Get out.
5903520	5904520	Get out.
5904520	5905520	God damn it.
5905520	5906520	Just get out yet.
5906520	5907520	I'm so...
5907520	5909520	It's got to be on Apple TV any day now, though.
5909520	5910520	Come on.
5910520	5911520	Let's go so fast.
5911520	5913520	I did not know the amount, but that makes me very happy.
5913520	5917520	That's a lot of money and they know exactly where to put that money, so that's very cool.
5917520	5923520	And anybody that listens to the show and thinks that donations to the ACLU is money misspent,
5923520	5926520	I would say fuck straight off into the night.
5928520	5932520	Well, I think it would be a good exercise to use your compulsion for proving things
5932520	5934520	wrong and poking holes in things.
5934520	5936520	Research the ACLU.
5936520	5941520	Go back and find out if you can find corruption or malfeasance or anything, and I don't say
5941520	5942520	that rhetorically.
5942520	5944520	It's just that I've never...
5944520	5946520	When Trump got elected, it was like...
5946520	5947520	They were like a lighthouse.
5947520	5951520	They were there right away and it was like, this is going to be a legal battle, like 90%
5951520	5953520	of this battle front.
5953520	5954520	Yeah.
5954520	5956520	And it was when...
5956520	5957520	It was at the...
5957520	5958520	Whatever.
5958520	5959520	What am I babbling about?
5959520	5960520	Whatever.
5960520	5963520	But it's like there is no ACLU gate.
5963520	5969520	You will see a history of them being vilified because they represent civil liberties, which
5969520	5975520	sometimes involves defending the rights of people to say and do shit that makes them
5975520	5976520	people you don't like.
5976520	5978520	And we all have an emotional urge.
5978520	5981520	Some people hate it when you defend the oppressed.
5981520	5983520	They are not down with it.
5983520	5985520	The ACLU is there to do it.
5985520	5987520	We all have an emotional...
5987520	5991520	Yeah, it's hard to be an objective, just like, oh, you know what I'm in favor of?
5991520	5993520	I'm in favor of freedom, plain and simple.
5993520	5999520	Every once in a while, that's going to make you an advocate of a loud mouth that's saying
5999520	6002520	really mean, nasty things and stuff like that.
6002520	6006520	Or saying that somebody got somebody's trunk.
6006520	6008520	We know that there's something in there, but you know what?
6008520	6013520	You don't have a fucking right to search it yet because the right to search that person's
6013520	6015520	trunk has to hold stronger.
6015520	6019520	You can't blow up that right with anything in that trunk.
6020520	6022520	It's not a popular position sometimes.
6022520	6029520	They're an agency that's always a confederacy that's always been fighting for us.
6029520	6032520	There's a lot of tomatoes that has gotten thrown their way.
6032520	6036520	I mean, they were badasses when they showed up at the airport first.
6036520	6037520	Yeah.
6037520	6041520	And they were miserable because they were there all day and night and people were coming
6041520	6042520	up screaming at them.
6042520	6047520	They're doing a shitty job for probably not a lot of money or maybe no money at all.
6048520	6049520	That was a rough gig.
6049520	6055520	And they sat there and got shit done and had people released out of custody because they
6055520	6058520	shouldn't have fucking been in the first place.
6059520	6060520	All right.
6060520	6065520	And then, you know, and now Planned Parenthood is next.
6065520	6066520	We'll have to figure something out.
6066520	6071520	We can't just keep on saying every dollar that the podcast makes, but we'll have to.
6071520	6076520	That's more of a defensive game where we're like, you know, the ACLU is like, let's put
6076520	6079520	money into the pockets of the people that show up at the briefcases when people are
6079520	6081520	being illegally fucked with.
6081520	6083520	You know, Planned Parenthood is more tragic.
6083520	6086520	I'd be quite happy doing the same thing for Planned Parenthood because they need protection
6086520	6087520	more than anybody right now.
6087520	6091520	But we can also sort of just want to throw it out.
6091520	6093520	Local.
6093520	6094520	We got to start local.
6094520	6099520	It'd be cool if we started local too because then maybe we can have those people on.
6099520	6100520	Yeah.
6100520	6104520	We could set an example in L.A. and like blossom out with the Planned Parenthood around here.
6104520	6107520	Greg Proops is the smartest man in the world podcast.
6107520	6112520	When he travels, he has Planned Parenthood there at every event, like organizing and
6112520	6113520	doing stuff like that.
6113520	6118520	And I know that by saying this on a podcast, there'll be six assholes that call us baby
6118520	6121520	killers because they're idiots.
6121520	6125520	It's protecting not just women's rights, mostly women's health care.
6125520	6126520	But it's not just women.
6126520	6127520	It's also everybody.
6127520	6131520	But mostly it's women's health care and the idea that women get to do what they fucking
6131520	6132520	want.
6132520	6133520	It's also not.
6133520	6135520	Cody pointed this out to me.
6135520	6137520	I don't know nothing from nothing.
6137520	6142520	The Planned Parenthood they've associated with you don't walk in and get a free abortion.
6142520	6144520	You pay for the fucking abortions that you get there.
6144520	6146520	It's not it's not why they're there.
6146520	6147520	It's also three percent.
6147520	6149520	It's health care for poor people.
6149520	6150520	It's there.
6150520	6153520	It's like there for women that aren't there.
6153520	6157520	They're looked at as a as some kind of pre-existing condition.
6157520	6161520	And it's a place where you can get the shit that's not paid for.
6161520	6166520	The idea that it got wrapped up in a oh well yeah but the abortion thing that's controversial.
6166520	6170520	There was nothing controversial about people being taken care of and they fucking did it
6170520	6171520	again.
6171520	6172520	They unplugged the whole thing.
6172520	6175520	It's about misogyny, plain and simple.
6175520	6178520	It's that women are the enemy for some strange reason in this regime.
6178520	6180520	Not just this regime but for forever and forever.
6180520	6185520	People who made those selling fetuses videos have been jailed.
6185520	6187520	Like they've actually been tried and gone to jail.
6187520	6188520	15 years.
6188520	6191520	It's like not it's not a story people know about.
6191520	6192520	Well I don't know about it.
6192520	6193520	I don't know about the selling.
6193520	6196520	Well Doug knows about it which is why he's about to do a hardcore rap.
6196520	6199520	Here we go.
6199520	6209520	Wait what.
6209520	6210520	Yeah.
6210520	6211520	Just let it happen.
6211520	6222520	I mean Doug just let it flow through you.
6222520	6225520	Yeah.
6225520	6227520	Or Dan you want to start.
6227520	6228520	Maybe Doug you can do that.
6228520	6231520	Yeah Dan can start us off for sure.
6231520	6242520	I am a first trimester fetus.
6242520	6243520	Yeah.
6243520	6246520	If you're not going to join us beat us.
6246520	6251520	If you're not going to join us then beat us.
6251520	6252520	Yeah.
6252520	6261520	I'm a third trimester here to say I'm about to come out in a biological way.
6261520	6265520	It's not about me usually.
6265520	6268520	It's more about me.
6268520	6276520	Why is pregnancy viewed as something that can happen to someone other than me.
6276520	6282520	I'm a fetus you see but whether I'm a man or a woman I will deal one day with pregnancy.
6282520	6290520	When you're making a workforce for your nation it doesn't matter the celebration.
6290520	6299520	This is a really bad dumb rap about an area that shouldn't be rapped about.
6299520	6305520	I don't like the combination tonally.
6305520	6310520	My name is Peanut Jones.
6310520	6312520	Peanut Jones.
6312520	6318520	My name is Peanut Jones.
6318520	6320520	I'm hard and crunchy.
6320520	6322520	Good source of protein.
6322520	6324520	Take me on a hike.
6324520	6327520	Put me in your trail mix.
6327520	6333520	But don't eat me if you have an allergy to me which is something anyone could say.
6333520	6336520	I am a saltine cracker.
6336520	6337520	Saltine cracker?
6337520	6339520	Also don't eat me if you have an allergy to me.
6339520	6341520	That's what I'm saying.
6341520	6342520	Thank you.
6342520	6344520	I got what you were saying.
6344520	6346520	Anyways.
6346520	6354520	My name is Peanut Jones and I'm here to say I'd like to spell the word say today.
6354520	6358520	S to the A to the Y.
6358520	6360520	I just spelled the word.
6360520	6365520	I didn't try to rap this slow or this badly.
6365520	6368520	I fucked your mama so hard.
6368520	6371520	I did it sadly.
6371520	6373520	I started to cry.
6373520	6381520	My tears dripped down on her face as I said, why am I fucking you?
6381520	6385520	It's like my partner had died in a cop movie.
6385520	6391520	But I was fucking your mom all day and all night long.
6391520	6393520	My name is Peanut Jones.
6393520	6395520	Take me seriously.
6395520	6403520	I fucked your mama conspiratorially.
6403520	6412520	It was a group of me and a group of them and there was meetings with Russians in a hotel back then.
6412520	6414520	Paul Manafort was there.
6414520	6416520	He was taking money.
6416520	6421520	I saw him go back home and met with Donald Rummy spelled.
6421520	6424520	And he gave some money to...
6424520	6426520	All right.
6426520	6429520	Okay. Sorry.
6429520	6433520	Peanut Jones.
6433520	6437520	Peanut Jones.
6437520	6440520	Peanut Jones.
6440520	6441520	All right.
6441520	6448520	Now back to abortion.
6448520	6451520	All right. Okay.
6451520	6452520	All right.
6452520	6456520	You deflected from the topic Peanut Jones.
6456520	6467520	When the sperm hits the egg, what grows first is a leg, then another leg next,
6467520	6471520	and then two arms, and then the head comes last.
6471520	6475520	So you have 30 trimesters.
6475520	6478520	One for each finger.
6478520	6481520	All right. No.
6481520	6484520	Peanut Jones.
6484520	6487520	Peanut Jones and a doctor, y'all.
6487520	6490520	Peanut Jones never went to school.
6490520	6496520	I'm not a prenatal scientist. I'm a peanut.
6496520	6500520	But let me tell you just what I know and you disagree.
6500520	6503520	There are 140 trimesters.
6503520	6505520	Peanut Jones.
6505520	6514520	They shuffle from every four years if there's a leap trimester.
6514520	6520520	That's when Irish people are born every four years.
6520520	6524520	Also, Peanut Jones is racist.
6524520	6526520	But I love the Irish.
6526520	6529520	So it's not racism.
6529520	6535520	Racism develops in the 45th trimester.
6535520	6540520	It coincides with fingernails and a nervous system.
6540520	6548520	Because, and this isn't a popular opinion, race is real.
6548520	6552520	More real than potassium.
6552520	6562520	The mother takes in race, and through the umbilical cord, race goes into the baby.
6562520	6566520	That's how babies become racial.
6566520	6569520	And racist.
6569520	6572520	My name is Peanut Jones.
6572520	6579520	I'm here to spread information about fetuses.
6579520	6581520	Bring it down, Doug.
6581520	6583520	Bring it down, Doug.
6583520	6585520	Bring it down, Doug.
6585520	6587520	Bring it down, Doug.
6587520	6589520	I flow like mad on a dragon's breath.
6589520	6591520	I'm going to breathe fire on your mother's death.
6591520	6593520	I'm going to star into the sky.
6593520	6595520	I'm going to breathe down and I don't know why.
6595520	6598520	I go from castle to castle and tell him, King, I fucked your mama with a diamond ring.
6598520	6600520	Put everything on my finger and let it linger.
6600520	6602520	I fucked your mama and tell her I got a stinger.
6602520	6604520	Come out of my dick, allergic to pollen.
6604520	6606520	Yo, motherfucker, fall it.
6606520	6608520	It's like an MC who's never going to go down.
6608520	6609520	They go to the moon door.
6609520	6611520	They're like, they have a frown.
6611520	6612520	Fuck you.
6612520	6613520	Fuck everybody.
6613520	6616520	Fuck every race.
6616520	6619520	Starting with white people.
6619520	6621520	Take it or get me a hurry down, everybody.
6621520	6626520	That's been our show.
6626520	6628520	It's here for Doug Benson, everybody.
6628520	6633520	Doug Benson.
6633520	6637520	Rob Schrap.
6638520	6640520	Emily Gordon.
6640520	6644520	Camille Nanciani.
6644520	6647520	Brandon Johnson.
6647520	6650520	Spencer Crichton, everybody.
6650520	6654520	Jay Cook for bringing me absence and booze.
6654520	6657520	Thank you very much, Jay.
6657520	6660520	Join us next week when we have nobody apparently, right?
6660520	6664520	We have a cavalcade of nobody.
6664520	6666520	I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
6666520	6671520	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
6671520	6676520	Tonight's beat is by Zack McKeever backstage.
6676520	6677520	Thank you.
6677520	6678520	We'll see you next time.
6678520	6679520	One more time for Meltdown Comics.
6679520	6680520	Drive fast.
6680520	6681520	Take chances.
6694520	6701520	Did you get any of that?
6701520	6704520	It's a cool show.
