0	21000	Hello, one and all, Harbontown is now in session.
21000	30000	Oh yeah. I have a very good feeling about this one.
30000	36000	My name is Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
36000	47000	But more to the point, let's welcome out the mayor of Harbontown, Dan Harmon.
47000	51000	Thank you. Thank you.
51000	55000	Wow, you're a lively crowd. I feel obligated to reciprocate your energy.
55000	61000	I don't want to act how I feel. You're so...
61000	63000	How do you feel?
63000	65000	In contrast to their jubilance.
65000	70000	Look-ubrious, lethargic, laconic. You know, I feel like Dan Harmon.
70000	74000	But you guys feel like, you're like Joey from Friends.
74000	82000	You're like a golden doodle. You want to just fetch the rope in the front yard.
82000	84000	I think you just call them stupid twice.
84000	88000	I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry. Okay, that's...
88000	89000	Adorable, but stupid.
89000	93000	No, but I'm convinced that... No, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean that.
93000	98000	You're filled with a life that only a god could embody.
98000	104000	No, I'm not going to let him... Maybe you are stupid. It doesn't matter.
104000	110000	Maybe stupid is what you're supposed to be. Maybe being smart isn't a good idea.
110000	114000	What does being smart mean? Knowing more about how we're going to die.
114000	117000	Isn't that what we've all found out as we've gotten smarter?
117000	124000	Don't we just figure out more and more about how we're dying?
125000	131000	Didn't dumb people at the beginning of human civilization, when life expectancy was 25,
131000	133000	didn't everybody think they were going to live forever?
133000	136000	Isn't that why they did so much dumb shit?
136000	138000	Because they thought that gods walked among them,
138000	141000	and they thought it was okay to abuse each other and themselves.
141000	144000	Because they thought that even though they only lived to 30
144000	146000	before they got eaten by a saber-toothed tiger,
146000	150000	that they were destined for greater things and that they never really died.
151000	155000	Didn't we slowly uncover the fact that we were actually only going to live
155000	158000	for a certain amount of time and then evaporate into the cosmos?
158000	164000	As we covered those stones, didn't we figure out ways to keep us alive a little bit longer, ironically?
164000	168000	Also, if you take vitamin C, you won't get scurvy.
168000	174000	We slowly extended the lifespan of an intelligent species to around 80,
174000	177000	and we spend those 80 years knowing that life means nothing.
177000	179000	Jack shit.
179000	183000	We evolved from a species of puppy dogs, you know?
183000	189000	We used to just be these weird toga-wearing murderers.
189000	193000	Just run around in the dirt alleys, just going like,
193000	196000	Ah! Zeus says I can stick a dick in this tree.
196000	200000	Just a bunch of toga-wearing Matt LeBlancs running around.
200000	202000	Yeah.
203000	207000	That's the best character on Friends, right, Joey?
207000	209000	That's the guy you want to be.
209000	212000	That was the Troy, in community terms.
212000	214000	It's just a dog, you know?
214000	219000	He loves, he's innocent and sort of looks at things in terms of vertically.
219000	222000	Salt must be better than pepper or vice versa.
222000	225000	There is no salt and pepper.
225000	227000	That's what I always said about the Troy character.
227000	229000	I said, this is a guy you have to imagine.
229000	231000	Don't judge any of these characters,
231000	235000	but the character of Troy knows that there's 26 letters in the alphabet,
235000	239000	and he knows which letter is more awesome than which.
239000	242000	He doesn't look at it like just a line.
242000	245000	He has, and it's not A through Z.
245000	247000	It's all jumbled up.
247000	252000	He thinks that C is more awesome because it's shaped in a more awesome way,
252000	254000	but D's above it.
254000	257000	Anyways, what am I talking about?
257000	260000	Your energy, your energy. Let me reward your energy.
260000	262000	What do I got to do?
262000	264000	I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.
264000	267000	You shouldn't do what you did to the green room.
267000	271000	I came into the green room, ladies and gentlemen, moments ago,
271000	275000	and could smell Dan's shit from outside the green room.
275000	282000	And I came in there, and it was heavy.
282000	285000	I made a boo-boo.
285000	287000	And you weren't there.
287000	289000	I came in, Dan wasn't there, and I assumed Dan got here,
289000	293000	took his shit, and then quit harmontown.
293000	296000	Because if I had taken the shit that he took,
296000	299000	I would have quit harmontown.
299000	301000	And so would you have.
301000	305000	While I was doing it, I actually looked up and looked around
305000	308000	for vents and stuff.
308000	310000	Have you ever done that?
310000	313000	You have to be 40 or above to,
313000	315000	while you're taking it incredibly,
315000	317000	I actually started inspecting the infrastructure.
317000	321000	I bet this is going to be a problem.
321000	325000	I think I'm pooping in someone's garage.
325000	328000	I think I'm going to ruin the party.
328000	330000	Yeah, it's bad back there.
330000	332000	The green room is not great.
332000	333000	Do you feel better now? Are you all right?
333000	335000	I feel great.
335000	337000	I feel emotionally bereft,
337000	342000	but gastro-intestinally clear.
342000	346000	Anyways, don't do that.
346000	349000	I'm a bad person. I took stinky shits.
349000	351000	Nobody here has ever taken a stinky shit
351000	353000	and bummed anybody out, right?
353000	354000	No, you're all angels.
354000	357000	You're all wonderful millennial angels.
357000	359000	You believe in civic service.
359000	362000	You vote for politicians.
362000	363000	You believe in causes.
363000	365000	You have Facebook causes.
365000	366000	You're going to make everything great
366000	368000	with your comments in your comments sections.
368000	370000	You're not Generation X.
370000	371000	You're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
371000	372000	You're wonderful people.
372000	376000	You don't understand why Instagram would have ads.
376000	379000	Shame on them.
379000	383000	You made Instagram with your Instagrams.
383000	384000	Where are these ads going to come out?
384000	386000	I'm not going to Instagram anymore.
386000	391000	I'm a millennial.
391000	394000	I hate the millennials, Jeff.
394000	396000	I don't even know if they're millennials or not.
396000	398000	I hate whoever's younger than me.
398000	400000	I'm a little embarrassed to even admit
400000	402000	that I don't know what a millennial is.
402000	404000	I guess it's just whatever's after.
404000	406000	Baby boomer, Generation X, millennial.
406000	407000	That's what it is.
407000	410000	Above the baby boomers, it's Grandma and Grandpa,
410000	412000	Guadalcanal, the greatest generation.
412000	414000	The people that actually did shit
414000	418000	and are now dead because they did shit.
418000	420000	And if they're left alive, they're going like,
420000	425000	so the Japanese are good now?
425000	427000	And I'm supposed to care why?
427000	430000	And we're like, Grandpa.
430000	433000	Rob Reiner was like, maha.
433000	434000	Those are baby boomers.
434000	436000	Rob Reiner and all in the family.
436000	438000	Sally Struthers, those are the baby boomers.
438000	442000	Now Generation X is 40, me.
442000	444000	I'm one of the younger Generation Xers, you two.
444000	447000	We're actually Generation X depending on who you ask.
447000	449000	Douglas Copeland, whoever.
449000	451000	You don't pinpoint this stuff.
451000	453000	It's not like everyone gets together like an Ender's game
453000	456000	and has some brood.
457000	459000	But you go by these sort of sine waves.
459000	462000	And I don't want to buy into this shit any more than anyone else.
462000	467000	However, I do feel like when I listen to today's 13-year-old talk,
467000	469000	I do hear my mom.
469000	474000	And I do think that these star children,
474000	477000	these fucking new babies that are coming up,
477000	480000	I do think they're full of shit.
480000	483000	I think that they love unity.
483000	486000	I think they don't have that.
486000	490000	I feel like baby boomers were sort of typified by,
490000	491000	oh, we landed on the moon.
491000	492000	We wood stocked.
492000	494000	We sock hopped.
494000	495000	We Billy Joel.
495000	496000	We did everything.
496000	498000	Hey, Billy Joel.
498000	503000	Dan, don't include Billy Joel with Woodstock in the space program.
503000	504000	All right.
504000	505000	You're right.
505000	509000	He did not start the fire.
509000	511000	I listened to that song today.
511000	513000	You had to be a big shot.
513000	514000	Remember that song?
514000	516000	It was like, we didn't start the fire.
516000	519000	There's a part where it's like, children of thalidomide.
523000	525000	It's just funny to me that there's a song
525000	527000	where you follow the phrase children of thalidomide
527000	530000	with a hot sizzling guitar riff.
534000	536000	Anyways, where was I?
536000	538000	Baby boomers with the thing.
538000	540000	And we're the David Cross generation.
540000	542000	We keep our flannel tight.
542000	543000	We keep our hands in our pockets.
543000	544000	We don't look.
544000	546000	We were like, fuck you.
546000	547000	Fuck everything.
547000	549000	Fuck, fuck, fuck everything that has a gimmick.
549000	550000	Fuck it all.
550000	552000	That's not culture either.
552000	554000	But we had one thing.
554000	557000	We perfected one thing, integrity.
560000	562000	How dare you scoff at that?
562000	567000	I heard a full blown like, yeah, that was Adam Goldberg.
567000	569000	A full blown rap.
569000	570000	No, fuck you.
570000	572000	Yeah, integrity.
572000	575000	Are you talking about Mr. Integrity, Adam Goldberg?
577000	580000	The idea, that's all you have going for you
580000	582000	if you sit in the corner of the room and go,
582000	585000	fuck this, fuck that, fuck it.
585000	587000	You may be part of the problem.
587000	589000	You may not be a hero ever in your life.
589000	591000	But at least you know.
591000	594000	You know who you are and you know what you ain't doing
594000	597000	and you're not playing into any larger hand.
597000	600000	And I think that because now those people
600000	602000	are having children and are kind of going,
602000	604000	I don't know, what do you want to do?
604000	607000	And these 13-year-olds have these little textures
607000	609000	in their hands and they're kind of like,
609000	612000	they're so excited about this idea that we can all be one
612000	615000	and we can all unite and we can all recycle
615000	618000	and we can all refreeze the polar ice caps.
618000	621000	But the general result is that they're just
621000	624000	intolerable fucking cocks.
624000	625000	13-year-olds?
625000	628000	Yeah, yeah, that's right.
628000	630000	The first, I want to be the Ben Franklin
630000	633000	of hating 13-year-olds.
633000	636000	I'm telling you, we've got six years left
636000	638000	to kick their asses.
638000	640000	They're going to be driving soon.
640000	643000	What was the last encounter you had with a 13-year-old?
643000	645000	He had Dino's kid, she's a...
645000	646000	I don't know.
646000	647000	Yeah, okay, all right.
647000	650000	It's only what I read online.
650000	652000	I don't know.
652000	654000	It's comment sections mainly.
654000	657000	I just assume all those people are 12.
657000	659000	I assume everyone online is 12, but they're all 40,
659000	661000	just like us.
661000	664000	But what about sexy 12?
664000	666000	42.
666000	667000	Oh, yeah.
667000	669000	All right, okay, fine.
669000	670000	You caught me.
670000	673000	I don't know anything I'm talking about.
673000	676000	That's a millennial way of thinking right there.
676000	678000	I used to play where his math gets checked.
678000	681000	In Generation X, you used to be able to just say shit
681000	683000	and get away with it.
684000	686000	Yeah, but just shit on an American flag
686000	688000	and throw it out the window.
688000	690000	You're saying that Generation X had integrity?
690000	691000	Yeah.
691000	692000	That's right.
692000	693000	We didn't do anything.
693000	694000	That's right.
694000	695000	That's why we had integrity.
695000	696000	No.
696000	698000	As you said, and I...
698000	699000	Here's some things we didn't do.
699000	701000	Watergate.
706000	707000	We didn't do that.
707000	708000	We wouldn't do it.
708000	709000	No.
709000	712000	We did allow our country to go to war
712000	714000	several times, and we kept our flannel tight
714000	715000	and our hands in our pockets.
715000	717000	Yeah, but we said it was lame.
720000	723000	A really flaccid, ineffectual generation, I would say.
723000	724000	Yeah, yeah.
724000	726000	No great art.
726000	729000	Also, let's put a fine point on it.
729000	733000	The 90s, would that be Generation X's music, maybe?
733000	734000	Yeah.
734000	736000	The worst music.
736000	737000	But it had integrity.
737000	738000	Right now, right now.
738000	739000	No, it didn't.
739000	742000	Because right now, if you turn on satellite Sirius XM radio
742000	746000	and you turn on the 90s station, a shitty song is playing.
746000	747000	Jeff.
747000	750000	And that is a fucking guarantee.
750000	754000	Jeff, would a shitty generation have the self-awareness
754000	759000	and self-effacement to have a pocket full of its own kryptonite?
762000	764000	That's something that millennials won't do.
764000	767000	All they want to do is bring sexy back.
767000	768000	They're bringing sexy back.
768000	770000	I got a pocket full of kryptonite.
770000	773000	It's deep.
773000	775000	I don't want to talk about it anymore.
775000	777000	And when I don't want to talk about something,
777000	780000	we don't talk about it, because I'm Generation X.
780000	783000	And you millennials can go fuck yourselves.
783000	785000	Because you're 13, and you're 25,
785000	788000	and I don't know what I'm talking about.
788000	790000	And I don't have to.
790000	793000	Because I'm 40.
793000	795000	Dan, I think what you're trying to say is
795000	797000	you want them to get off your lawn.
797000	799000	Yeah.
799000	800000	Yeah.
800000	802000	You work hard in that lawn every weekend.
802000	804000	Not there with your lawn mower and your mulch.
804000	805000	Yeah.
805000	807000	I earned it.
807000	809000	Your lawn has integrity.
809000	811000	And these millennials are stomping all over it.
811000	812000	Yeah.
812000	814000	Stop stomping all my lawn with your comments section.
814000	817000	With their Frisbees and their hula hoops and their whatnot.
817000	819000	Who cares if Instagram's going to have ads?
819000	821000	What did you ever do for Instagram, you fucks?
821000	823000	Wait, Dan.
823000	824000	Dan.
824000	826000	I was disgusted, America.
826000	827000	Wait a second.
827000	829000	I was disgusted.
829000	831000	Instagram said, we're going to have ads now.
831000	836000	I was disgusted by your response, you guys.
836000	841000	It sounds like you're the one disgusted by ads on Instagram.
841000	843000	No, I'm not.
843000	847000	Look, I'm just doing Instagram because I want people to look at my dog.
847000	850000	My dog's sometimes cute when he's sleeping.
850000	854000	Instagram's where I know that 12,000 people will look at it.
854000	857000	I don't care if it says Nike above it or it doesn't.
857000	859000	If it does, tough titties for me.
859000	861000	I guess it's hard to run Instagram.
861000	865000	I'm Generation X. I know what's up.
865000	868000	It's hard to make an Instagram.
868000	870000	You guys were born into it.
870000	871000	You know it's going to be lame.
871000	872000	It was Insta for you.
872000	875000	It's already lame to say you're 40 and Gen X.
875000	877000	That's already lame.
878000	880000	Baby Boomers came up with that name.
880000	881000	Did they?
881000	883000	We just didn't reinvent it.
883000	885000	We called Generation Y Generation Y.
885000	889000	Generation Y like Baby Boomers went, I prefer millennials.
889000	890000	Is that true?
890000	891000	Sure.
891000	892000	Yes.
892000	894000	I don't know what's true.
894000	896000	I don't know.
896000	899000	Generation X is called Generation X because the Baby Boomers said,
899000	901000	you're like Generation X.
901000	904000	And we went, I don't care.
904000	907000	And then the next generation came along and they went, name me.
907000	908000	And we went, I don't know.
908000	909000	Why?
909000	910000	And they were like, no, no.
910000	913000	Star babies.
913000	919000	We want a Trivial Pursuit Edition because we have an identity.
919000	925000	What would the trivia categories be on the pie of Generation Y?
925000	927000	Conscientiousness.
927000	929000	Words that hurt.
935000	937000	Fairies.
937000	939000	Different fairies.
939000	941000	Probably something about vampires and werewolves.
941000	943000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
943000	947000	Bloodthirsty monsters that don't have fangs anymore.
949000	950000	All right.
950000	952000	What are we moving on to?
952000	954000	I don't know.
956000	958000	You really are a grumpy old man.
958000	961000	You took a huge shit and you came at her and now you're...
965000	967000	I think we do have a special guest.
967000	968000	I don't want to put her on the spot.
968000	970000	But Erin made a new friend tonight.
970000	974000	She was at a Kamikaze, which is Stan Lee's convention.
974000	977000	And she did a panel with some ladies.
977000	978000	I don't know what the panel was called.
978000	980000	Ladies of powerful ladies.
980000	981000	I don't know. Sexy ladies.
981000	982000	I have no idea.
982000	983000	My girlfriend was on it.
983000	988000	But she made friends with a pioneer of what is now a comedic institution,
988000	989000	which is kind of an interesting thing.
989000	993000	And you don't know if she's here.
993000	996000	If I just awkwardly say...
996000	997000	Hillary Clinton, everybody.
997000	999000	Please bring her up.
1002000	1004000	Did Lorraine Newman make it tonight?
1004000	1005000	No.
1005000	1006000	Okay.
1007000	1008000	Wow.
1009000	1013000	Who is that guy that's such an expert on her not making it?
1015000	1017000	This is like a big Mr. Clean guy.
1017000	1018000	No.
1019000	1020000	I would know.
1020000	1021000	Then.
1021000	1023000	That's Chevy Chase back there.
1024000	1027000	I was hoping to talk to her a little bit about our mutual...
1027000	1028000	Yeah, we both worked with a mutual...
1028000	1030000	Wait, so Lorraine Newman was going to be here?
1030000	1031000	Yeah, she made friends with Erin.
1031000	1032000	She's a delightful...
1032000	1033000	And then she came to the green room.
1033000	1034000	She smelled that giant...
1034000	1035000	Yeah, we made best friends, Erin said.
1035000	1037000	She smelled your giant shit and she fucking...
1037000	1038000	Oh, no.
1038000	1043000	I probably fucking smoked her out with my big gross fucking McDonald's poop.
1044000	1047000	Lorraine Newman, if you're out there, thank you for not coming.
1047000	1049000	You would have only smelled my poop.
1051000	1052000	I'm bummed out.
1052000	1054000	I would love to meet Lorraine Newman.
1054000	1056000	Well, yeah, no, it'd be interesting to talk to her just a little bit.
1056000	1063000	I don't know how sick she is of talking about SNL, but she was there in 1975 at the beginning
1063000	1066000	of what is now like the exon of comedy.
1066000	1072000	But when it wasn't the exon of comedy, when it was a variety show, it was just a variety show.
1072000	1073000	It was live.
1073000	1077000	It wasn't meant to be archived and, you know, oh, this is Coneheads number three.
1077000	1078000	This is Coneheads number four.
1079000	1082000	It was the first NBC show to fire its creator and bring him back.
1087000	1088000	Back when that was cool.
1088000	1091000	Yeah, back when that resulted in success.
1095000	1103000	But in lieu of that, I don't know, man, this is a Tupperware container in the back of the fridge
1103000	1107000	that has got a lot of different colors that I can see through the translucent body.
1109000	1113000	Jeff, Jeff, I don't go on Reddit anymore and I don't go on.
1116000	1121000	Well, hold your applause because this is a segment of the show called Because I don't go on Reddit anymore.
1121000	1123000	What the fuck is going on on Reddit?
1126000	1128000	Because I get tweeted things.
1128000	1129000	I got tweeted.
1129000	1131000	Jeff, do you know what do you know?
1131000	1132000	Do you know what a subreddit is?
1132000	1137000	Look, I've gone on Reddit twice and I don't understand what the ups and the downs
1137000	1140000	and there's a little picture of a Martian and I don't know what's going on.
1140000	1141000	It's millennial shit.
1141000	1142000	Yeah.
1143000	1144000	They think that's changing the world.
1144000	1151000	Wait, so you go on, it's not a regular forum because depending on whether people like what you wrote or not, it moves up and down.
1151000	1152000	Yeah.
1152000	1156000	So if I look at it one day and then go back the next day, it's all in a different order based on its own popularity.
1156000	1157000	Yeah.
1157000	1158000	Gay.
1159000	1160000	Downvote.
1163000	1164000	Right.
1166000	1167000	All right.
1167000	1168000	And I mean gay in a Gen X.
1168000	1170000	I don't care if gay is bad, gay.
1171000	1172000	Not your millennial.
1172000	1173000	Oh, come on, man.
1173000	1175000	Bullying shit, man.
1177000	1178000	Integrity.
1179000	1180000	That's not integrity.
1180000	1181000	It's just coping a cunt.
1183000	1184000	Wait, I'm sorry.
1184000	1185000	I don't even know what you're talking about.
1185000	1187000	No, we're not good people that we think are...
1187000	1188000	No, I'm not sure we're good people.
1188000	1189000	That's so retarded.
1190000	1192000	That's not integrity.
1192000	1194000	Integrity doesn't mean good person.
1194000	1195000	Integrity means...
1195000	1196000	No, it does.
1196000	1197000	That's exactly what it means.
1197000	1198000	No, integral.
1198000	1199000	Integral.
1199000	1200000	To what?
1200000	1201000	To what?
1201000	1202000	To one's self.
1202000	1203000	Self-contained.
1203000	1204000	Self-contained.
1204000	1205000	Yeah, integrity.
1205000	1206000	I know who I am.
1206000	1208000	So we're self-contained assholes.
1208000	1209000	Yeah, sure.
1209000	1210000	All right, so you're not...
1210000	1211000	I'm sure...
1211000	1212000	You know what?
1212000	1213000	Some of us are self-contained good people.
1213000	1214000	Kurt Cobain.
1215000	1216000	He seemed all right.
1217000	1218000	On the inside?
1218000	1219000	Seems, yeah.
1222000	1223000	I don't know.
1223000	1224000	He seemed like a good guy to me.
1224000	1226000	Seemed like he had integrity.
1226000	1230000	How many of today's artists have the balls to blow their brains out?
1230000	1232000	Because they're popular.
1232000	1237000	Or how many artists today have the balls to marry somebody who hires somebody to blow their brains out?
1237000	1238000	Oh, come on.
1238000	1239000	No!
1245000	1247000	She... she had him killed.
1247000	1248000	Come on.
1248000	1250000	She fucking had that dude killed.
1250000	1251000	It's not ours to say.
1251000	1252000	It's mine to say.
1253000	1255000	Because you have integrity.
1256000	1257000	That's my point.
1262000	1264000	Shareation X, baby.
1265000	1268000	We're not going to go down as the coolest generation.
1269000	1272000	We're not even knowing the top ten in this century.
1274000	1275000	Oh, that's true.
1276000	1280000	But we did open the roads to trade agreements with China.
1281000	1282000	In our own way.
1283000	1285000	When you say we, you mean you and me?
1285000	1286000	Yeah.
1287000	1288000	Well, you and me and Doug Benson.
1288000	1291000	No, baby boomers did that on our watch.
1291000	1293000	Well, they loosened the mayonnaise jar.
1294000	1297000	But Generation X really, really drove it home with China.
1298000	1305000	We are the reason why Iron Man 3 had a special segment in it where the Iron Man lands in China and says,
1305000	1306000	I love China.
1308000	1309000	That was our doing.
1309000	1310000	It was this generation.
1310000	1312000	Does Gen X like China?
1313000	1317000	We have now come to terms with the fact that we have to like them.
1318000	1325000	To the point where we re-edited Red Dawn and airbrushed out all the Chinese flags into North Korean flags.
1326000	1330000	Generation X is the generation that has now come to terms with China.
1331000	1332000	Come to terms with it.
1333000	1336000	The way Newton came to terms with gravity.
1337000	1338000	This exists.
1338000	1339000	China exists.
1340000	1342000	We are the Marco Polo of...
1343000	1344000	Integrity.
1344000	1346000	People in a world where China's already been discovered.
1347000	1348000	All right.
1348000	1349000	What were we talking about?
1350000	1351000	A new segment called...
1352000	1353000	Red Dawn.
1353000	1354000	Red Dawn.
1354000	1355000	Okay.
1355000	1356000	All right.
1356000	1357000	So, subreddit.
1357000	1358000	There's a Harmontown subreddit.
1358000	1359000	Yeah.
1360000	1361000	All right.
1361000	1362000	So, remember our friend Levi?
1362000	1363000	Yes, I do.
1363000	1364000	With the shoes?
1364000	1365000	Yeah.
1365000	1369000	Our kind of cross-dressing...
1369000	1370000	So, he tweeted me...
1370000	1371000	He's on band now.
1372000	1376000	Well, Adam, you're coming up.
1377000	1379000	I don't know what you're talking about.
1379000	1380000	I don't either.
1380000	1382000	Adam has to come up and talk about this.
1382000	1384000	Adam is a moderator of the subreddit.
1384000	1386000	Levi was banned.
1386000	1387000	Wait, wait.
1387000	1389000	Who elected Adam, moderator of the subreddit?
1389000	1391000	Adam created the subreddit.
1391000	1392000	Oh.
1392000	1393000	Is that how it works?
1393000	1394000	Okay.
1395000	1397000	Adam, would you like...
1397000	1400000	You don't have to come up, but I'm inviting you up to...
1400000	1403000	I want to talk about the subreddit maintenance.
1407000	1413000	This is a fact-finding mission.
1413000	1418000	How is adding scenes to Iron Man 3 integrity?
1418000	1421000	I was obviously being ironic.
1421000	1423000	You guys are really good at irony.
1423000	1424000	Yeah.
1424000	1427000	That's why we invented Iron Man.
1432000	1433000	Wow.
1433000	1434000	All right.
1435000	1437000	Well, we invented loving him.
1440000	1444000	After Baywatch, there was a wonderful series called Baywatch Nights
1444000	1448000	that everybody watched, and it went more than six episodes.
1448000	1451000	And after Harmontown, there was harmontown.com
1451000	1454000	and then a Reddit section to discuss Harmontown.
1454000	1455000	Right.
1455000	1457000	So, I created it.
1457000	1458000	Someone annoyed me.
1458000	1460000	I gave them a week off.
1460000	1461000	They're back now.
1462000	1466000	And I learned the depth to which I am disliked.
1466000	1467000	May I interrupt?
1467000	1469000	When you say you gave someone a week off,
1469000	1475000	that sounds like you sent somebody to Tahiti on an all-expense paid vacation.
1475000	1478000	Any other website but our Harmontown is Tahiti.
1480000	1481000	What?
1481000	1482000	I got...
1482000	1486000	You sent someone to the cornfield, like the kid in Twilight Zone?
1487000	1488000	That's a good episode, yeah.
1488000	1489000	You banned him from it?
1489000	1490000	Yeah.
1490000	1491000	Because what?
1494000	1495000	Look, I'm going to start.
1495000	1496000	It takes one to know one.
1496000	1498000	Neither do I know nor do I care.
1498000	1500000	I don't know what's going on.
1500000	1501000	I just want to know.
1501000	1505000	No, but really, I mean, yeah, I appreciate...
1505000	1509000	I'm cognizant of the fact that dragging you up here is...
1509000	1513000	You're up at the plate with two strikes against you, blah, blah, blah.
1513000	1515000	But I really do.
1515000	1517000	I am actually curious.
1517000	1519000	I also think there's some inherent entertainment value.
1520000	1522000	At that point, I believed the first two parts.
1522000	1523000	I did not believe that part.
1523000	1526000	You don't think that I thought that it would be entertaining to talk about it?
1526000	1527000	No.
1528000	1530000	Well, I accept that I would be wrong.
1530000	1534000	This is like a DVD commentary about a DVD commentary.
1535000	1536000	But I wanted to talk to you...
1536000	1540000	What I was really thinking about when I was talking about that was how that...
1540000	1543000	But also, I've been on the Harmontown subreddit and I've seen, like, you know,
1543000	1547000	as in all of Reddit, you see every once in a while, you see the brackets and it says,
1548000	1549000	What does that mean? What happens?
1549000	1552000	Sometimes it's user-deleted, sometimes it's automatically deleted.
1552000	1553000	Well, sometimes people delete their own...
1553000	1554000	Yeah.
1555000	1558000	Like, if you say something like Tahiti being something-something,
1558000	1561000	you can be like, I didn't say that at all. I deleted.
1561000	1563000	But if someone responds to you and says,
1563000	1568000	You're full of shit and here's why, you can go back and delete your comment
1568000	1571000	and just leave that person hanging there, going like,
1571000	1575000	You're full of shit, Mr. Deleted in brackets.
1576000	1578000	Which is why you have to quote extensively.
1578000	1581000	You have to say, well, you said this, this, and this,
1581000	1583000	but actually the capital is Mogadishu.
1583000	1586000	So I think you've been welcomed to the own zone.
1586000	1588000	Hashtag own zone.
1589000	1591000	So our friend Levi...
1591000	1594000	Didn't use that term.
1594000	1595000	Our friend Levi...
1595000	1596000	Appointance?
1597000	1600000	Is in the Harmontown subreddit where,
1600000	1605000	let's all admit that nobody's...
1605000	1610000	Tomorrow's senators are not running through the Harmontown subreddit.
1610000	1612000	It is hopefully a place for misfits.
1612000	1613000	I think it's a glory...
1613000	1615000	It's like a field of dreams of glory holes,
1615000	1617000	but there are some animals mixed in there.
1617000	1618000	Right.
1618000	1620000	So it's not some...
1621000	1623000	Okay, now I'm back in.
1630000	1636000	It is a place where normal interactions are theoretically possible,
1636000	1642000	but the medium makes them squealier than nearly anything else.
1642000	1644000	Your internet is a toilet theory.
1644000	1645000	Yes, it is.
1645000	1646000	And it's horrendous.
1646000	1650000	And I'm speaking to you as a guy who won't even go back there
1650000	1655000	because I realize that even the act of being there can cause harm to people.
1655000	1658000	So I'm not attacking you, but I'm definitely curious
1659000	1660000	and think it's an important conversation
1660000	1663000	as we talk about going to form a colony on the moon
1663000	1666000	and you are in this situation, appointed or not,
1666000	1669000	where you created the subreddit, which I thought was a...
1669000	1670000	It's a good place.
1670000	1672000	It is a good discussion venue.
1672000	1674000	So it put you in the place of a moderator
1674000	1676000	and now you're in the position, you got this band button
1676000	1679000	and you clicked on it for this guy who's been on our show
1679000	1682000	with his no shoes and his crazy talk.
1682000	1685000	I think his thing was he was barefoot and wanted to be pregnant.
1685000	1686000	Right.
1686000	1687000	So what did...
1687000	1688000	Deep cut.
1688000	1691000	What did he do in the subreddit that made the difference
1691000	1695000	between clicking ban and just letting him go?
1695000	1699000	I think it was like the 87th post of why did you ban me
1699000	1702000	that retroactively justified everything.
1702000	1704000	But if you look at someone's comments on Reddit,
1704000	1707000	it tells you how many times that you downvoted them
1707000	1708000	or how many times they're like,
1708000	1710000	I don't want to read this ever again.
1710000	1713000	So his crime was being the Dan Harmon of the Harmon town subreddit?
1713000	1716000	He was being the Adam Goldberg of the Harmon town subreddit.
1716000	1719000	But the Adam Goldberg of the Harmon town subreddit banned him,
1719000	1721000	which is why this is so fascinating.
1721000	1722000	It isn't.
1722000	1727000	At some level that arbitrary power has the ability to be arbitrary.
1727000	1729000	But why did you ban him?
1729000	1731000	Because I was annoyed.
1731000	1734000	It was getting to the point where every single comment
1734000	1736000	was him responding to someone.
1736000	1738000	And I'm going to take this at a personal level.
1738000	1741000	Back in January at the show at the Egyptian
1741000	1745000	when I rushed on stage and embarrassed myself,
1745000	1749000	that was because I was thinking about Harmon town almost all the time.
1749000	1750000	What am I going to say at Harmon town?
1750000	1751000	What should I do for Harmon town?
1751000	1753000	What should I wear for Harmon town?
1753000	1756000	That wasn't a very healthy place to be.
1756000	1759000	And when you see someone who's all their internet posts are,
1759000	1760000	hey, this relates to Harmon town.
1760000	1761000	This is how I feel about Harmon town.
1761000	1763000	Is that how you feel about Harmon town?
1763000	1767000	You realize that in someone else is something that's been plaguing you.
1767000	1770000	And so giving them it's arbitrary.
1770000	1771000	It's a sign of power.
1771000	1774000	And I regret doing it because the entire community's consensus was,
1774000	1775000	I shouldn't have done it.
1775000	1776000	Okay.
1776000	1777000	So this is confessional for you, right?
1777000	1779000	This is the trap you fell into.
1779000	1783000	You felt like a nerd and an underdog.
1783000	1787000	And you felt like you had done things that you shouldn't have done.
1787000	1789000	And then you saw someone else doing them.
1789000	1791000	And you were like, yeah.
1791000	1792000	And that's what we all do.
1792000	1795000	And I didn't go about it very eloquently.
1795000	1797000	Internet is not a venue for eloquence.
1797000	1799000	It doesn't have a lot of eye contact.
1799000	1800000	It doesn't have pitch.
1800000	1803000	I have a very high standard for word choice on the internet.
1803000	1804000	Absolutely.
1804000	1808000	And I demand 100% being sarcastic.
1808000	1811000	Yeah, otherwise deleted by deleted, we'll get up in there.
1811000	1817000	But the fact that we can create communities about communities
1817000	1823000	by someone who created community shows your theory that millennials are
1823000	1829000	a really abstracted pictures of pictures of pictures of frames generation
1829000	1831000	because everything is iterated.
1831000	1833000	Everything has a comment section.
1833000	1835000	Everything is a direct response.
1835000	1838000	A way to yell at Clint Eastwood, hey, at Clint Eastwood,
1838000	1843000	you are Tefagorked, LOLs, hashtag LOLs.
1843000	1846000	And the person who reads that can click every other instance
1846000	1848000	if someone misspelling laughs out loud.
1848000	1850000	And that's our culture.
1850000	1851000	That's our culture.
1851000	1854000	And it may not be Kurt Loder on MTV News, but it's...
1854000	1866000	It's everyone thinking they're Daria.
1866000	1871000	It's every single Daria in the high school library writing to every other Daria.
1871000	1875000	That's really interesting because nobody would be more into that than Gen Xers.
1875000	1876000	That's how we approach it.
1876000	1878000	We're like, oh, shit, everyone's a Daria.
1878000	1881000	But fuck these Darias using this thing.
1881000	1885000	That's interesting because we thought Kurt Loder was as good as it got.
1885000	1887000	No, we didn't.
1887000	1889000	Yes, we did, Jeff.
1889000	1890000	Stop.
1890000	1891000	Don't be a fucking sellout.
1891000	1892000	No, Dan, Dan.
1892000	1894000	Stop tying me to fucking Kurt Loder.
1894000	1896000	Jeff, you loved him.
1896000	1899000	Please welcome to the stage Kurt Loder.
1899000	1900000	Is he here?
1900000	1903000	I don't...
1905000	1908000	Kurt Loder.
1908000	1910000	What did that guy do wrong?
1910000	1913000	He did nothing wrong, but he didn't speak for us.
1913000	1916000	I wasn't saying he was the Walter Cronkite of our generation.
1916000	1918000	Well, that was the implication.
1918000	1922000	What Adam was saying, what I'm extrapolating from that,
1922000	1928000	is that a huge technological threshold that we crossed between these generations,
1928000	1930000	depending on where you draw the line,
1930000	1935000	is that we went from passive one-way transmission into interactive.
1935000	1938000	We have a generation that's grown up on the internet.
1938000	1941000	It means that they get to say something back.
1941000	1945000	It doesn't fucking matter to Rupert Murdoch what they have to say,
1945000	1948000	and yet we have to all deal with each other
1948000	1952000	in this swirly, eyes-wide shut toilet of everyone saying back to each other.
1952000	1955000	And Gen Xers are coming from a place of like,
1955000	1958000	you know, in my day, you just, you know, you did what you had to do
1958000	1960000	and you put yourself out there,
1960000	1963000	and if somebody had something to say back,
1963000	1967000	it got back to you through less channels,
1967000	1969000	thinner fiber-optic lines,
1969000	1972000	and now it's just we're all swimming around in this turd pit.
1972000	1974000	It used to take real effort to threaten a celebrity.
1974000	1976000	You need to find out their address.
1976000	1979000	You need to get to the post office, get a stamp.
1979000	1982000	And now it's just a few clicks on your phone,
1982000	1985000	and I think that has a deeper effect
1985000	1988000	than just being allowing us to yell at each other a little louder.
1988000	1989000	Yeah.
1989000	1993000	My big concern is the psychological or philosophical,
1993000	1994000	maybe you would call it,
1994000	2000000	the impact of people feeling like it's revolutionary
2000000	2006000	to use that medium to police each other,
2006000	2011000	when in my day, Kurt Loder told kids what to dance to,
2011000	2015000	and there was a president above him who went to war with all the countries
2015000	2016000	and launched the Tomahawk missiles,
2016000	2018000	and nobody ever questioned the politician.
2018000	2020000	No, you're exactly right.
2020000	2021000	That's not how MTV worked,
2021000	2024000	because it had nothing to do with what the president did above him.
2024000	2027000	But Kurt Loder told the kids what to think and what to feel,
2027000	2030000	and the kids told Kurt Loder whether or not he was full of shit,
2030000	2034000	and you reacted to Kurt Loder by getting your haircut different from Kurt Loder
2034000	2036000	or getting your haircut the same as Kurt Loder,
2036000	2038000	and nothing ever affected the fucking president.
2038000	2041000	Flash forward to today, where you have a president,
2041000	2042000	and instead of Kurt Loder,
2042000	2044000	you have eight million fucking YouTube channels.
2044000	2047000	You have a bunch of people swirling around each other,
2047000	2049000	and what you don't have is anybody asking
2049000	2051000	what the fuck the president is doing.
2051000	2053000	That's why it's a little infuriating to me
2053000	2056000	that the toilet underneath what used to be Kurt Loder
2056000	2059000	is now consumed with policing each other.
2059000	2062000	It's like they've tricked us into self-hatred,
2062000	2065000	which is a common thing that happens all the time.
2065000	2068000	Are you racist? Are you sexist?
2068000	2072000	We're going to do this dance forever, really?
2072000	2075000	Yeah, everyone wants to squeak, squab everyone else.
2076000	2083000	I'm alarmed about it because they turned the key on the internet.
2083000	2085000	They're like, here we go, everybody.
2085000	2086000	Here's the internet.
2086000	2088000	And the government must have been like,
2088000	2091000	holy shit, what the fuck are they going to do?
2091000	2094000	And they crossed their fingers and closed their eyes,
2094000	2096000	and then they slowly unplugged their ears,
2096000	2099000	and all they heard was, got milk ads.
2099000	2101000	What's up?
2101000	2102000	What's up?
2102000	2103000	What's a super friend doing? What's up?
2103000	2107000	Between Kurt Loder and the internet, there was a show called TRL.
2107000	2110000	Total Request One Woo for TRL, which is accurate.
2110000	2115000	Total Request Live was the bridge between mass culture and prescribed culture.
2115000	2119000	Yes, because you could totally request live.
2119000	2121000	People would go to New York and make part of their visits
2121000	2123000	standing outside MTV Studios and saying,
2123000	2125000	I need to hear Bye Bye Bye.
2125000	2127000	I need to hear Bye Bye Bye.
2127000	2130000	Technology, which had never existed on Good Morning America.
2131000	2133000	Well, but now there's nothing like that,
2133000	2135000	because you can watch music videos whenever you want.
2135000	2139000	You don't have to hear a snippet of 98 Degrees' new hit.
2139000	2143000	And you don't have the music video television telling you
2143000	2145000	whether or not this is a hot record
2145000	2147000	or something that's going to be into the pit.
2147000	2148000	But that affects consumption.
2148000	2152000	It doesn't affect how we react to the people who live behind these marble walls.
2152000	2155000	No, it's not a wealth poverty dynamic.
2155000	2157000	It's a person to listener dynamic.
2157000	2159000	Isn't that crazy? Isn't that weird?
2160000	2161000	Isn't that weird?
2161000	2164000	How the ability for all of us to talk to each other all of a sudden
2164000	2167000	has absolutely no impact above a certain level?
2167000	2168000	It didn't.
2168000	2170000	Do you think the patricians in ancient Rome were like,
2170000	2176000	oh, that guy, these scribblings, these rude frescoes.
2176000	2177000	I think that in ancient Rome,
2177000	2181000	when somebody announced that there was a new way to measure a rectangle,
2181000	2184000	sometimes that dude got his fucking arms and legs cut off.
2184000	2185000	Oh, yeah, bad example.
2185000	2187000	Because it threatened the way we thought about government.
2187000	2190000	There was a lot of murder because of people's ideas in ancient Rome.
2190000	2195000	I think that the guy that decided the sun was at the center of the solar system,
2195000	2200000	a seemingly benign idea, was forced to repent.
2200000	2202000	A benign idea that wasn't in the Bible.
2202000	2203000	Correct.
2203000	2205000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
2205000	2209000	Because now that we've defeated the Christians,
2209000	2213000	now we have no more power structures to overcome, right?
2213000	2216000	We don't have a religion in this world that's telling us what to think of this.
2216000	2219000	I think religion is, if you go look at Tehran or something,
2219000	2224000	that religion as a powerful societal influence can be extremely restrictive
2224000	2227000	in what people say, but also how they think.
2227000	2232000	They found that in some Saharan African cultures that if there's no past tense,
2232000	2235000	there is no words that follow concepts like promise.
2235000	2240000	There's no word in Swahili for promise because it requires the past tense of,
2240000	2245000	I said I was going to do something, now I'm not under that obligation.
2245000	2249000	Words are directly power, and when you give words like the Bible,
2249000	2253000	like the Torah, like the Quran, the power to be absolutely true
2253000	2257000	and free of the strictures of science and free of the questioning of the man on the street,
2257000	2260000	those words gain eternal power.
2260000	2261000	Now we don't have that.
2261000	2264000	The internet, it was even there at all.
2264000	2268000	One of the first websites I visited was called Skeptics Annotated Bible.
2268000	2269000	That was when I was a little shit.
2269000	2270000	It was 2003.
2270000	2273000	I would sneak out from swim at a summer camp
2273000	2277000	and look up all these passages of the Bible and then like little pictures in the sides like,
2277000	2278000	how can that be true?
2278000	2280000	That's mathematically false.
2280000	2282000	Well, what did it say in Genesis 1?
2282000	2290000	And just the ability to transmit ideas instantly against the strictures of religion
2290000	2294000	has like a Martin Luther effect on changing our culture, a Gutenberg effect.
2294000	2297000	We beat the Bible a million years ago.
2297000	2298000	No.
2298000	2305000	No, you can look at the skyline of a city and see that the buildings that have to do with money.
2305000	2306000	All right.
2306000	2307000	All right.
2307000	2309000	Sonic the T-shirt, jacket, and a Power Ranger shirt.
2309000	2311000	The power combo has now reached the stage.
2311000	2312000	How have you been?
2312000	2313000	I'm after clapping.
2313000	2314000	You can applaud for Hayes Lewis.
2314000	2315000	How have you been?
2315000	2316000	Building rocket ships?
2316000	2319000	Hayes Lewis has joined us.
2319000	2321000	Hayes Lewis, I was just thinking about today, has come up on stage.
2321000	2323000	I was just thinking about you the other day, like going,
2323000	2327000	oh, man, we squandered our Harmanian who was actually building spaceships.
2327000	2330000	Well, yeah, I was just helping people build them.
2330000	2335000	Yeah, but if any, I mean, you're doing more than Adam in terms of space flight.
2335000	2340000	Once we get to the moon, we may need Adam to tell us.
2340000	2342000	Hayes, what compelled you to come up to the stage?
2342000	2346000	Well, the idea that we beat religion, and it's just like a big no.
2346000	2349000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2350000	2354000	And all I've done is read, and I'm just like an internet guy.
2354000	2355000	I'm not going out there.
2355000	2358000	I'm not, you know, like actually talking to people.
2358000	2360000	It's just things I've read.
2360000	2367000	If you go to any kind of area outside of a city, things can be like hundreds or like,
2367000	2372000	or just at least 60 or 50 years behind what we think we've already beaten.
2372000	2374000	Absolutely.
2374000	2378000	And that's, when we talk about, oh, that's just rural area.
2378000	2380000	Well, that's most of the country.
2380000	2383000	Most of the world, places where children can't go to school because of their gender,
2383000	2385000	we haven't beaten religion.
2385000	2386000	In Los Angeles, we have.
2386000	2391000	In Los Angeles, you could be gay 80 years ago, and it wasn't a huge deal.
2391000	2393000	But in most of the country, that is tantamount to saying,
2393000	2397000	the devil has control of your senses, motivations, and instincts.
2397000	2398000	You are a flaw.
2398000	2400000	Absolutely conceited, you guys.
2400000	2401000	Absolutely.
2401000	2405000	However, as a sort of like, the people that are making things,
2405000	2409000	the people that have constructed the glass in your eyeglasses,
2409000	2412000	the people that are, like as a society,
2412000	2415000	the people that have built the skyscrapers that are taller than the churches
2415000	2418000	and the skyline, the people that are printing the newspapers,
2418000	2423000	the people that are kind of like, you know, secular,
2423000	2428000	the people that are the silent majority, like, I'm not,
2428000	2431000	it's strong language to say, we won, we beat them,
2431000	2434000	because that implies there's no more fight to be fought.
2435000	2442000	What I mean when I say that is, we have to get our shit together.
2442000	2444000	We are empowered now.
2444000	2448000	We know that logic is important.
2448000	2449000	We know...
2449000	2450000	I really agree.
2450000	2453000	I think that, and this is something very strongly,
2453000	2456000	I guess I'd like to broadcast out to the world,
2456000	2459000	I think everyone needs to pick the path of least resistance.
2459000	2461000	You don't argue with people.
2461000	2463000	Arguing never convinces someone of anything.
2463000	2465000	We just convinced him of something.
2465000	2467000	Well, he's open.
2467000	2468000	No, that's not true.
2468000	2470000	If you guys had told me that I was wrong about something,
2470000	2473000	I would have fucking batted it off because I'm a primate.
2473000	2477000	You changed me by saying how you felt about something
2477000	2482000	and I was invited to make sure that you knew that I was also in that water.
2482000	2483000	That's important to know.
2483000	2485000	And you're open, you're one of the most open people,
2485000	2487000	you're open to people coming up,
2487000	2489000	and I just walked in, I had no right to do it,
2489000	2491000	and you're fine with that.
2492000	2494000	Don't do it, you guys.
2494000	2501000	But it's fact that when you...
2501000	2506000	I've been polling-ish the Fox News comment section
2506000	2507000	and just being like,
2507000	2509000	Obama's trying to give me gay health care.
2509000	2513000	Just trying to take it to the extreme level
2513000	2516000	to see when they go back and other republicans will be like,
2516000	2518000	I don't think he's trying to do that.
2518000	2519000	That hasn't happened yet.
2519000	2522000	They just kind of agree.
2522000	2527000	There's so little resistance to just going into the New York Times Facebook comment section
2527000	2529000	no matter what the story is and just saying, God is real.
2529000	2531000	And someone will pick a fight with you.
2531000	2533000	Someone will pick a fight with you.
2533000	2535000	And then when they do, you say, that's a good point,
2535000	2537000	but you forgot that God is real.
2539000	2542000	But I can't even remember what...
2542000	2544000	This is this rabbit hole that we go down.
2544000	2551000	I mean, if you guys want to get in a knife fight with people that are...
2551000	2554000	They sort of have constructed their worldview
2554000	2558000	around something that absolutely needs to be argued with.
2558000	2562000	But there's a mindset where...
2562000	2567000	I know atheists that are so immature about their atheism
2567000	2571000	that I sometimes encourage them to just be Christian.
2572000	2578000	You're such a fucking zealot about how God doesn't exist.
2578000	2580000	I feel like you're protesting too much,
2580000	2585000	and I didn't walk into this bar feeling like God didn't exist
2585000	2588000	so much that I needed to get into a knife fight about it,
2588000	2592000	whereas you do, so maybe you need to go back to the thing.
2592000	2596000	And I also know atheists that are the most compassionate, wonderful...
2596000	2598000	That's why they're technically...
2598000	2600000	The word atheist almost is...
2601000	2602000	Go ahead.
2603000	2604000	I don't think...
2604000	2606000	People think when you become an atheist or a Christian,
2606000	2607000	that's like an achievement,
2607000	2610000	but no, I feel like an asshole will be an asshole in any culture.
2610000	2611000	Sure.
2611000	2612000	They're just going to grow up and be like,
2612000	2616000	oh, this is the way I get to be an asshole and tell people what to do.
2616000	2620000	And in some cultures, it's easier to be this way or that way.
2620000	2621000	It doesn't matter.
2622000	2626000	We need to stop thinking of the spectrum between atheism and Christianity.
2626000	2629000	It's just, you're a cool dude and you're not a cool dude.
2629000	2634000	And so when we talk about subreddits and we talk about AV Club,
2634000	2637000	when we talk about defamer, we're living in this post-internet world,
2637000	2641000	the internet was created by these programmers.
2641000	2644000	It was created by the military to communicate ideas really quickly.
2644000	2649000	Yes, the military was like, what if you made computers together?
2649000	2650000	It's not helping us kill people.
2650000	2652000	Give it to the libraries.
2652000	2660000	But I'm talking about the code that was built,
2660000	2662000	what is it, 40 years old now?
2662000	2664000	What is Unix?
2664000	2671000	There's the code that we've built our entire virtual structure on.
2671000	2674000	I'm pretty sure that those guys didn't go home at night
2674000	2676000	and rub rosary beads and stuff.
2676000	2679000	I think those guys are, maybe some of them were Christian.
2679000	2681000	Like, Stephen Colbert is a fucking Christian.
2681000	2685000	But I also think that they're logicians.
2685000	2687000	They have to be.
2687000	2689000	They are pragmatic people.
2689000	2692000	Dan, can I get back to, the thing I started this all was you saying
2692000	2694000	that you are now not on subreddit?
2694000	2696000	You're not on the internet anymore?
2696000	2699000	Well, that's because I'm just hurting people every time I get on the internet.
2699000	2700000	So no Twitter, no Facebook, no...
2700000	2701000	Twitter is fine.
2701000	2704000	Twitter seems to be doing fine.
2704000	2707000	So I put pictures of my dog on Instagram and I'm on Twitter.
2707000	2712000	And then on Tumblr, people can send me messages.
2712000	2716000	And these kids send me messages and sometimes they say,
2716000	2719000	you know, I'm gay and I want to kill myself
2719000	2721000	and I can write them back privately if they wrote privately
2721000	2722000	and go, don't do that.
2722000	2723000	Keep being gay.
2723000	2726000	It sounds like you missed out on everyone after that episode
2726000	2728000	where you felt that you were hurting someone.
2728000	2730000	Everyone's like, no, I want Dan Harmon to keep up.
2730000	2731000	Yeah, it was like 98%.
2731000	2732000	Yeah, Dan rolls.
2732000	2733000	Dan Harmon needs to keep talking.
2733000	2736000	Well, there's a polarizing effect of that stuff.
2736000	2738000	You know what you have to do in those moments?
2738000	2740000	You have to shoot straight through the middle.
2740000	2743000	And I don't want to get warped by that idea.
2743000	2745000	I just felt like, I don't know.
2745000	2746000	You follow your bliss.
2746000	2749000	Like, my bliss is not hanging out on there.
2749000	2750000	I'm not doing it passive aggressively.
2750000	2754000	How is anybody's bliss living in a fucking comment section?
2754000	2755000	I can't understand it.
2755000	2756000	Exactly.
2756000	2758000	Yes, I mean, I was born in 1973.
2758000	2759000	I'm an old fuddy daddy.
2759000	2761000	Get off my lawn, you whippersnappers.
2761000	2764000	But fucking comment sections is just a bunch of fucking anger,
2764000	2767000	a bunch of misguided spleen for no reason.
2767000	2770000	Well, people being sarcastic like me and trying to get a reaction.
2770000	2772000	I will answer that question, Jeff.
2772000	2773000	Adam, you went mad with power.
2773000	2775000	You were in control of something.
2775000	2778000	And the first time somebody reminded you of yourself,
2778000	2781000	you snuffed him out like a cigarette.
2781000	2783000	It's an ugly, ugly world.
2783000	2786000	And the reason I looked at Reddit, I went down a thing.
2786000	2788000	And some things, people say very sweet things.
2788000	2790000	Sometimes people say, I don't like it.
2790000	2791000	And here's why.
2791000	2793000	And it's very succinct and very well worded and lovely.
2793000	2796000	But mostly, it's just a bunch of spiraling nonsense.
2796000	2799000	And I'm not trying to stop what's going on here.
2799000	2803000	But watching four men talk about religion and politics is like the fucking,
2803000	2805000	like it's all guys do.
2805000	2806000	Guys get together.
2806000	2807000	We have a couple drinks.
2807000	2808000	Not like girls.
2808000	2810000	No, no, no.
2810000	2813000	We haven't even talked about Jesus' shoes, which are fantastic.
2813000	2814000	But I did mention you, sir.
2814000	2815000	Adam, I was talking.
2815000	2817000	Shut the fuck up.
2817000	2819000	No, women talk about interpersonal things.
2819000	2821000	And guys try to solve the world's problems.
2821000	2822000	And we get together.
2822000	2824000	And we just spiral around and do all this stuff.
2824000	2828000	And the internet, to me, is just this weird spiraling morass of inanity.
2828000	2833000	And I look at it and go, if I want to just complain, I'll type some shit.
2833000	2835000	And it's watching people just bicker.
2835000	2837000	And I hate bickering.
2837000	2838000	It's not as much.
2838000	2839000	It sounds like you hate waste.
2839000	2840000	Uh-huh.
2840000	2841000	Waste.
2841000	2844000	Waste of time, waste of energy, waste of the English language.
2844000	2851000	I hate the abbreviation of our language into clicks and grunts, which H.L.
2851000	2856000	Menken in the 20s or 30s predicted before typewriters and computers and before.
2856000	2862000	Maybe not before typewriters, but before people wrote through typing, he predicted that our
2862000	2868000	language would be reduced to a series of short grunts and clicks and abbreviations and anagrams.
2868000	2871000	Or what's the acronyms?
2871000	2873000	And he's absolutely right.
2873000	2876000	It's like watching people have discourse like that.
2876000	2877000	It's shocking.
2877000	2879000	Our language is dying.
2879000	2885000	And I think there's nothing to be proud of by a culture that communicates through feedback
2885000	2886000	loops like that.
2886000	2889000	I think that there's no art to it.
2889000	2891000	There's no intelligence necessary.
2891000	2895000	And I think there's no vetting process and there's no qualifications for someone to go
2895000	2900000	on there and moderate something, to ban somebody, to go on there and flame somebody, to go
2900000	2904000	on and torture people, to go on and tell you to shut up, for you to feel bad about
2904000	2907000	that, for you to even care about it.
2907000	2908000	I go to restaurants.
2908000	2910000	I look at Yelp because Yelp is great because it tells you where.
2910000	2915000	I travel a lot and I'll type in Italian restaurant if I'm in the mood or pizza or Thai food or
2915000	2916000	whatever I want.
2916000	2918000	And you look at it and I look for the worst reviews.
2918000	2924000	And if I see some counter-dish bag or some guy go, I went on a first date to Bangkok,
2924000	2925000	Thai palace.
2925000	2926000	And my date was pretty unhappy.
2926000	2928000	I was like, no, you had a bad time.
2928000	2929000	You're an asshole.
2929000	2941000	If I find the most bad reviews, I go to that restaurant because that guy won't be there.
2941000	2942000	Yeah.
2942000	2947000	Well, so, but listen, so you go to the drawing room, you got your suit on, you play darts,
2947000	2950000	you have the same conversation you have with the regulars there.
2950000	2952000	There's some repetition there.
2952000	2953000	There's some inefficiency there.
2953000	2957000	I'm not standing up for what you're talking about, but I'm saying it is human nature.
2957000	2959000	There's introverts and extroverts.
2959000	2963000	There's people who want to look good and people who are better at making eye contact.
2963000	2965000	I'm not in that school.
2965000	2966000	I'm graduating.
2966000	2971000	I'm being forced to graduate at 40 years old.
2971000	2975000	I do not want it to be happening to me, but I didn't want to quit smoking either.
2975000	2980000	I have to get off the fucking internet and I have to go sit in the corner of a bar and
2980000	2981000	drink.
2981000	2982000	Let's all get off the internet.
2982000	2983000	So I'll just throw it in the toilet.
2983000	2984000	It's like, wait.
2984000	2985000	Another last episode everybody.
2986000	2992000	But you guys were talking about before, about whether or not, hang on a second, because
2992000	2993000	I'll forget what I'm saying.
2993000	2998000	I'm sorry to cut you off, but the internet can be revolutionary and the moment there
2998000	3004000	is a protest in Seattle against the World Bank or whatever, and they turn off your fucking
3004000	3005000	Twitter.
3005000	3009000	They turn off your phones so people can't say, let's all meet and let's go protest.
3009000	3012000	And one person says, hey, let's all go break some windows.
3012000	3017000	That person goes to jail and didn't commit a crime, but for inciting a riot.
3017000	3022000	The Egyptian Spring, all the stuff, they made our telephones illegal because it can be
3022000	3023000	very powerful.
3023000	3030000	We do have in our fingertips the ability to take down institutions, governments, all kinds
3030000	3031000	of things.
3031000	3036000	They are very happy to watch us just LOL at LeBron James' tweet about somebody's asshole
3036000	3038000	and that's what it all is.
3038000	3044000	The moment it becomes effective and we do anything with it, it's possible to be great
3044000	3049000	graffiti on walls, like the situation is where the graffiti was incredible political screeds
3049000	3053000	and things like that that made sense and were provocative.
3053000	3059000	The moment you provoke anything on Twitter, they just shut off your cell towers and they
3059000	3061000	don't want you to actually communicate.
3061000	3065000	So what we've been limited to is pretending that what we're doing when we're typing these
3065000	3069000	things in and thumbing things instead of talking to the people and making eye contact
3069000	3071000	with anybody, we're not communicating shit.
3071000	3073000	We're doing the opposite of communicating.
3073000	3076000	We're inverting a C cucumber.
3076000	3078000	We're not doing anything positive at all.
3078000	3079000	I'm going to disagree.
3079000	3083000	Communication doesn't have to be revolution and fun can be fun.
3083000	3088000	Just because we're not marching on Washington or driving our trucks there in some failed
3088000	3091000	attempt to take out people in suits to change things.
3091000	3092000	No, no, no.
3092000	3093000	Fun is always legal.
3093000	3094000	Fun is always legal.
3094000	3095000	Fun is always illegal.
3095000	3096000	That's the point.
3096000	3099000	No one's going to outlaw checkers.
3099000	3102000	You can play Candy Crush and no one's going to take your phone away from you.
3102000	3106000	But the moment you use our ability to communicate with each other for anything that's provocative
3106000	3110000	or possibly revolutionary, that's when it's going to be illegal.
3110000	3111000	Absolutely.
3111000	3114000	Well, I don't think we're revolutionizing anything in person either.
3114000	3120000	And if the feds are the only people that have phones that are capable of Twitterizing, I
3120000	3122000	don't want to live in that society either.
3122000	3125000	I miss the good old days because we were the last people that were actually born.
3125000	3131000	I think that born in 1973, I remember no answering machines.
3131000	3133000	The answering machine was an invention as I was a child.
3133000	3135000	And before then, the phone just rang.
3135000	3137000	And if you didn't pick it up, you weren't home.
3137000	3140000	And fuck you and whoever.
3140000	3141000	I ain't coming.
3141000	3146000	And I remember as being a kid, my mom and dad, the phone rang, and we'd all look around
3146000	3147000	and it rang.
3147000	3149000	And we'd all just have a fork up.
3150000	3152000	My dad would have a cocktail and my mom would have a glass of wine.
3152000	3157000	And we'd all just look at each other like, we ain't doing it.
3157000	3158000	We ain't doing it.
3158000	3161000	And the beauty of solitude.
3161000	3164000	And then I remember I had a pager.
3164000	3166000	After people had cell phones, I got a pager.
3166000	3169000	I was like, I'm anchored to the sea floor now.
3169000	3171000	I can never ever be alone.
3171000	3173000	I can never ever be free.
3173000	3178000	And I think that's my grumpy, like, curmudgeonly grumpy old man thing.
3178000	3184000	There was a time when you weren't constantly tethered to every fucking person.
3184000	3186000	But we're talking about two different things.
3186000	3190000	As a guy who wears a suit to a bar and talks to people and hangs out,
3190000	3194000	you are getting a huge amount of usage out of the fact that everyone's
3194000	3196000	interconnected through the internet.
3196000	3198000	Yelp is one example that you mentioned.
3198000	3203000	You're asking a different question, which is why would anyone ever choose to
3203000	3207000	emotionally invest themselves into the conversations that take place on the
3207000	3211000	internet as opposed to the conversations that take place between you and your
3211000	3213000	friends at a dartboard and a bar?
3213000	3218000	And the answer is because in those conversations, people like me are rendered
3218000	3222000	completely irrelevant and also look at everything as irrelevant.
3222000	3225000	I don't want to talk to those people.
3225000	3226000	I've seen those conversations.
3226000	3228000	I don't get any joy out of them.
3228000	3231000	I don't like interpersonal small talk.
3231000	3235000	You had an entire book just of things you wrote because the internet gave you a
3235000	3236000	place where you could write them.
3236000	3237000	Exactly.
3237000	3239000	And I don't remember a goddamn word of those things.
3239000	3241000	My girlfriend published a book of them.
3241000	3244000	And I was 40 years old walking into my house.
3244000	3247000	And I didn't remember writing any of that shit.
3247000	3250000	And if that medium hadn't existed, I would have...
3250000	3252000	They'd be in a diary somewhere.
3252000	3253000	Well, not even.
3253000	3254000	Not even.
3254000	3255000	No way.
3255000	3259000	Because with a diary, there would have been no illusion that anyone was out there
3259000	3260000	reacting to me.
3260000	3263000	And there was something strange that happened to me when I discovered that thing
3263000	3265000	called blogging, which had that dumb word.
3265000	3268000	And all my hipster friends were going like, blogging, blog, blog, blog.
3268000	3269000	I'm not going to blog.
3269000	3271000	I'm going to blog, blog, blog, blog.
3271000	3273000	And I was like, you know what?
3273000	3274000	I still hate blog.
3274000	3276000	I hate away.
3276000	3277000	And I would come home...
3277000	3278000	Also, webisode.
3278000	3279000	Fuck you, webisode.
3279000	3280000	Webisode.
3280000	3284000	I would come home at the end of the night and I would have a medium in which I
3284000	3291000	could type my thoughts, which I somehow felt like someone's going to read this
3291000	3292000	somehow.
3292000	3295000	It was just some weird, paradoxical thing.
3295000	3299000	It was like, I'm allowed to write whatever I want because no one's ever going to
3299000	3300000	read it or care about it.
3300000	3303000	But only if people could read it theoretically.
3303000	3304000	Would I ever write it?
3304000	3305000	Because otherwise...
3305000	3306000	Why?
3306000	3307000	You're not going to read it.
3307000	3308000	Why would you scrawl it on an app kit?
3308000	3309000	What am I?
3309000	3310000	Sear hand, sear hand?
3310000	3311000	I'm not going to...
3311000	3316000	So, Dan, you're saying that now you've foresworn emotional reactions or connections to the
3316000	3319000	two comment sections in Reddit and things?
3319000	3323000	I'm not going to declare policy because I find that...
3323000	3332000	I followed my bliss and kind of I deleted my Reddit client from my phone and I deleted
3332000	3337000	my only avenues of connection.
3337000	3341000	And believe me, there's nothing against Reddit because it's only against the secondary effects
3341000	3346000	that can happen because Reddit actually is such a beneficial medium, I think, because
3346000	3353000	of its conversational tone, that it lends itself to the gawker defamer kind of spiral
3353000	3354000	for a guy like me.
3354000	3357000	Do you think it's because of celebrity and the intersection between celebrity and
3357000	3358000	technology?
3358000	3359000	Right.
3359000	3363000	Jeff, I'd like to say you having a cell phone is wonderful for your life.
3363000	3364000	You're an actor.
3364000	3368000	You want to be in your apartment every day hoping that you hear back for a part.
3368000	3369000	You can go out.
3369000	3370000	You can live a life.
3370000	3372000	You don't have to worry about the answering machine.
3372000	3374000	You don't have to worry about not having an answering machine.
3374000	3379000	As someone who gets gigs while he's driving or while he's at a party or at a friend's
3379000	3384000	house, being able to take my work with my pocket is tremendously freeing because there
3384000	3386000	are some days the phone doesn't ring at all.
3386000	3389000	But it's 7 p.m. on a Sunday.
3389000	3393000	I like to be able to know I'm going to work on Wednesday and not have to be at home.
3393000	3396000	Adam, why are you mad at me right now?
3396000	3402000	He thinks that you might possibly convince everyone in a room full of people to unplug
3402000	3408000	the internet because you have flesh and blood efficacy, which is something that Adam and
3408000	3409000	I do not have.
3409000	3419000	And so we like to sit in the corners of our dark apartments, or in my case, mansion, because
3419000	3423000	of what I write.
3423000	3427000	I love that you've committed to being a bad person.
3427000	3430000	We get an emotional charge.
3430000	3435000	I was going to say it's neither healthy nor unhealthy, but I might as well just say it's
3435000	3436000	unhealthy.
3436000	3440000	It can't possibly produce good effects.
3440000	3443000	None of us are living in the days of Jane Austen.
3443000	3446000	And was she nailing it?
3446000	3454000	Are we supposed to be going to picnics and doing special dances among the nobles to strengthen
3454000	3457000	some kind of class system?
3457000	3461000	It's a shame that you go to a dinner and your elbows are on the table, even though you pick
3461000	3462000	them up.
3462000	3465000	Adam is just broken into a flask of booze here.
3465000	3466000	I don't know what that is.
3466000	3467000	It's Harmontown Earthshine.
3467000	3470000	Give more than you take is the slogan of Harmontown Earthshine.
3470000	3472000	Oh, I don't even know what this is.
3472000	3473000	I do.
3473000	3475000	Who made this booze?
3475000	3478000	Sorry, we should have whoever's responsible for this come up and take credit for it.
3478000	3479000	What's your name?
3479000	3480000	Come on.
3480000	3481000	Get up here.
3481000	3488000	I'm holding a, I didn't know, I think somebody must have, hello.
3488000	3490000	What's your name, sir?
3490000	3491000	Glenn.
3491000	3492000	What's that?
3492000	3493000	Glenn.
3493000	3497000	I'm holding a bottle of, it says, it's Harmontown Earthshine.
3497000	3501000	And the slogan is give more than you take.
3501000	3503000	So, tell us about this.
3503000	3509000	So, yeah, so I started making, started home brewing it about 20 years ago.
3509000	3510000	It's moonshine?
3510000	3511000	It's moonshine.
3511000	3513000	What kind of liquor is it?
3513000	3515000	Whoo-hoo!
3515000	3517000	Double distilled.
3517000	3520000	This is about 130 proof.
3520000	3521000	130 proof.
3521000	3522000	Yeah, you want a water?
3522000	3525000	Oh, I can't drive home now.
3525000	3526000	Wow.
3526000	3527000	Yeah, the base liquor is actually...
3527000	3528000	I have to be Santa Monica tomorrow.
3528000	3532000	Yeah, I have to, I have to write like three episodes of Community tonight.
3532000	3537000	And just that sip is going to make the third one about like socks.
3537000	3540000	It's distilled from meat?
3540000	3544000	So, I mix basswood honey and maple syrup.
3544000	3546000	Pass that shit down, Adam.
3546000	3552000	And ferment it out with champagne yeast and then double and triple distill it.
3552000	3553000	Wow.
3553000	3554000	Wowie.
3554000	3555000	You just slid it in there.
3555000	3556000	I love that.
3556000	3561000	Dan took a sip and became the lyric from George Jones' White Lightning.
3561000	3564000	His eyes booked out and his face turned blue.
3564000	3569000	Yeah, I had immediate sensory memory of that Nashville show.
3569000	3570000	But I love that.
3570000	3571000	Oh, that's delicious.
3571000	3572000	I love that it's earth shine.
3572000	3573000	It's like a nice brandy almost.
3573000	3574000	Yeah, it's very nice.
3574000	3578000	It carries a lot of the flavor from the honey forward.
3578000	3579000	Good booze.
3579000	3581000	When did you first start brewing alcohol?
3581000	3584000	Fuck, you could run your fucking car on that stuff.
3584000	3585000	That's strong.
3585000	3588000	It's like paint thinner, if a paint thinner can't...
3588000	3594000	It'll take Sharpie off.
3594000	3596000	It's actually the base.
3596000	3603000	I keep some of it pure like this, but I usually actually use it as a base for an absinthe that I make every year.
3603000	3609000	I can't believe it took us this many episodes for people to start making us our own booze.
3609000	3612000	I love that it's earth shine because we'll be living on the moon.
3612000	3613000	That's brilliant.
3613000	3614000	Oh, God.
3614000	3616000	So, Glenn, how does somebody get into that?
3616000	3618000	Somebody you're into the ships and bottles and you're...
3618000	3619000	So, it's funny.
3619000	3625000	So, I actually started actually making a beer homebrew about 20 years ago.
3625000	3628000	We're not breaking so many federal laws by passing this booze around.
3628000	3629000	We didn't sell it.
3629000	3630000	It's not being sold.
3630000	3634000	Hey, give that back.
3634000	3635000	So, I'm actually...
3635000	3636000	I'm a scientist.
3636000	3637000	All right.
3637000	3638000	I'm a scientist.
3638000	3639000	I know.
3639000	3644000	I have a PhD in metallurgical engineering.
3644000	3645000	It tastes like it.
3645000	3646000	Okay.
3646000	3647000	And this is...
3647000	3648000	It's a hobby.
3648000	3649000	All right.
3649000	3650000	But it's a hobby then.
3650000	3651000	We're all going to jail tonight.
3651000	3652000	I love this.
3652000	3653000	I won't remember it.
3653000	3654000	Or getting laid.
3654000	3655000	It's a hobby.
3655000	3656000	Something good is about to happen right now.
3656000	3657000	It's already happening.
3657000	3658000	It's 9-11.
3658000	3659000	Whoo!
3659000	3660000	Damn it.
3660000	3661000	It makes someone good.
3661000	3662000	It's about to happen.
3662000	3672000	Why were they storing so much smoke in the World Trade Center?
3672000	3673000	Glenn, all right.
3673000	3674000	Everybody calm down.
3674000	3675000	I want to...
3675000	3676000	This is interesting.
3676000	3677000	Glenn...
3677000	3683000	Dan, have more moonshine because I want that natural energy you had back.
3683000	3687700	Because at one point you started dipping cheese sticks into ranch and then just smearing
3687700	3691280	the ranch into your face.
3691280	3692280	Shave cream.
3692280	3693280	You can cut it.
3693280	3694280	Put it on the rocks.
3694280	3695280	Cut it with a little bit of water.
3695280	3696280	Where's that bottle going?
3696280	3697280	It's over here.
3697280	3698280	Okay.
3698280	3699280	It's safely out of the way.
3699280	3700280	It's back in the...
3700280	3701280	No, no.
3701280	3702280	It's back in the back of the house right now.
3702280	3703280	No, we haven't.
3703280	3706800	It started with you making homebrew beer.
3706800	3711880	So you're making stuff in your garage that's designed to sip and get fucked up on.
3711880	3717520	But with homebrew beer, you have that sort of logical out of like, well, it's beer.
3717520	3718520	It tastes good.
3718520	3720000	I'm kind of sort of the flavor.
3720000	3723240	When you branch out into moonshine, you're sort of like...
3723240	3725480	You're becoming more of a Timothy Leary figure.
3725480	3728560	I'm curious about it.
3728560	3729560	It's really...
3729560	3731560	For me, it's more about the absence.
3732320	3734240	Because I also have an herb garden.
3734240	3738480	I grow all my own herbs that go into the absence, and then it's something that I offer to friends
3738480	3739480	every year.
3739480	3740480	Okay.
3740480	3742480	You're on the guest list for the rest of life.
3742480	3745480	You are all my friends.
3745480	3746480	Official boxes.
3746480	3747480	All right.
3747480	3754640	Well, let's have a hand for Glenn, and let's say goodbye to Adam Goldberg, too.
3754640	3755640	Thank you, Adam.
3755640	3755640	
3762160	3765400	I mean, I think we had an inter...
3765400	3766400	That wasn't a show killer, right?
3766400	3770440	We had an interesting conversation about the nature of the internet.
3770440	3771520	I think so.
3771520	3774080	I think it's something that it's not going to get solved here.
3774080	3776320	I mean, I think we all have different reactions, right?
3776320	3780480	You make a good point that you have a relationship with the internet that I don't have, because
3780480	3781960	I'm more of a...
3781960	3785000	I'm a more gregarious person.
3785000	3787440	And when I look at people having fake...
3787440	3789280	Or what I perceive to be...
3790280	3791280	That's not overstated.
3791280	3796000	There's lots of stuff I've seen on forums and on subreddits and stuff, the two times
3796000	3797760	I've gone to it or whatever.
3797760	3799360	People are having discourse.
3799360	3802240	It is actual conversation.
3802240	3809480	It so quickly dissolves into ego and me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me kind of stuff.
3809480	3815720	There's just so much bickering and fighting that I can't dig it, but I like to go be alone
3815720	3816720	in public.
3816720	3818800	I love being around people and not talking to them.
3819240	3822560	I don't need that much interaction.
3822560	3828280	I think it's awesome if you said you don't want to have that much of an emotion.
3828280	3831520	You don't want to tie your ego to the internet as much as you do.
3831520	3832920	Well, I can't anymore.
3832920	3834120	I'm not allowed to anymore.
3834120	3835120	I can't do it.
3835120	3836120	You are allowed to.
3836120	3838000	No, I can't.
3838000	3841960	I was talking to a community writer tonight at the drawing room before the show.
3841960	3845440	And he was talking about some guy, it was a professor, or something in some college
3845440	3846440	or something.
3846560	3847560	He was using examples.
3847560	3852280	So a phrase he used really hit home with me where he said, well, this guy was a critic
3852280	3853280	of literature.
3853280	3859240	And then he would say, and so like, uh, he became prominent and he didn't become prominent
3859240	3860240	because he was good.
3860240	3862120	It wasn't because he was bad.
3862120	3863640	He just became prominent.
3863640	3868800	He was a critic of literature and then he would, he would criticize Hamlet.
3868800	3875080	And then there were people that would go, holy shit, this guy, wow, Hamlet, even he
3875080	3876360	can criticize.
3876480	3877480	He's the best.
3877480	3881280	And then there were other people that would go, are you fucking kidding me?
3881280	3882360	Fuck you.
3882360	3885520	Lock you in a coffin and throw it in the ocean criticizing Hamlet.
3885520	3887160	Go fuck yourself.
3887160	3889640	And it was polarization.
3889640	3895200	This guy, like, like, like the, and the phrase he said, this community writer telling me
3895200	3901720	about this guy that really hit home with me was, oh, it kind of warped this guy, uh,
3901720	3904280	which made me realize, oh, you know why it warped him?
3904280	3907640	Because he was thinking about both of those things.
3907640	3909800	Because neither of those things are true.
3909800	3913920	He should be allowed to just have an opinion about Hamlet.
3913920	3918400	And if he's prominent because of it, that's just tough titties for him and tough titties
3918400	3920800	for anybody that listens to him.
3920800	3925600	He's not allowed anymore to base his identity on what people think about him because he
3925600	3929720	has entered the business of being prominent, whether he liked it or not.
3929720	3933800	And boy, oh boy, I'm sure he looks forward to the day when he's not prominent anymore.
3933800	3936840	But until then he's going to steer between those columns.
3936840	3939640	He can't be affected by the gravity on either side.
3939640	3942880	There's some people saying he's a God and some people saying he's a devil and they're
3942880	3943880	all full of shit.
3943880	3946120	It's like, that's not, they're not talking about a person anymore.
3946120	3949680	They're not talking about a guy who read Hamlet that has a feeling about it.
3949680	3951760	That's not what, that's not what anybody goes to that guy for.
3951760	3952840	How does that relate to you?
3952840	3957960	It means that I got to get the, I have to stay off of forums, Reddit, comment sections,
3957960	3961920	all that stuff, because that's where people will say that I am a God or a devil.
3961920	3964640	I cannot, I cannot let that stuff affect me anymore.
3964640	3965640	Good.
3965640	3966640	That's great.
3966640	3967640	You're great.
3967640	3974640	Speaking of great, let's bring Spencer on stage.
3974640	3986000	Hey guys, how are you guys doing tonight?
3986000	3991240	I'm not you audience, the two on stage.
3991240	3992520	You guys have gotten mad with power.
3992520	3993520	No, okay.
3993520	3997560	So do you ever, you know, when like a friend or a roommate or a family member takes a
3997560	4003080	shower and like right when the door opens or like right after you open, they open the
4003080	4006200	door and it's like, it's like hot and wet air.
4006200	4007200	Yeah.
4007200	4012560	That's what going into the green room tonight was like.
4012560	4013560	I'm sorry.
4013560	4014560	It was certainly hot and wet.
4014560	4015560	Yeah.
4015560	4016560	It was wet.
4016560	4018040	Like that's not even, that wasn't even Dan's fault.
4018040	4019040	It was human.
4019040	4020800	I was my fault.
4020800	4023320	I walked into the green room and it was the orchids were growing.
4023320	4027200	It was a, well, I sprayed a lot of Lysol.
4027200	4028200	That's okay.
4028200	4033600	Well that almost made it worse because I think the poop rode on the Lysol particles and distributed
4033600	4035440	out in the, into the room.
4035440	4036440	Yeah.
4036440	4040600	The, the, the thing that makes Lysol like effervescent crews throughout the air, just carried your
4040600	4043160	poop like a magic carpet ride around the room.
4043160	4046040	It was like your poop was wearing cheap cologne.
4047040	4048040	Yeah.
4048040	4059640	It's funny because it smelled like shit.
4059640	4066760	It takes a, it takes a big man to take that big of shit and an even bigger hand to say,
4066760	4067760	I'm so sorry.
4067760	4071280	Here's why, here's why I don't think you're a big man about it because I walked in there
4071280	4073960	and it was right before showtime and you weren't there.
4074880	4077680	I mean, part of you was there.
4077680	4080040	A certain, a certain essence of you was there.
4080040	4081040	That's not my fault.
4081040	4084280	Various molecules that you created were in there, but you were gone.
4084280	4087880	Like you left there, like you left a scene of a crime.
4087880	4090760	That's, that's, that is, that's all at Aaron's doorstep.
4090760	4093280	You can ask her about why I wasn't in there.
4093280	4096280	She took the shit.
4096280	4097680	Are you covering for her shit?
4097680	4102200	No, I'm throwing her under the bus and she can, I'm leaving it up to her if she wants
4102200	4103200	to talk about it or not.
4103440	4104920	Are you saying that shit, that was her shit?
4104920	4106600	No, no, it was my shit.
4106600	4107600	You fell on that grenade?
4107600	4111640	I was, I was sitting, I swear to God, I was sitting in that room and actually feeling
4111640	4115800	like in a weird medieval way, like I deserve to be sitting in here.
4115800	4120880	Neil, the documentary guy, uh, over here came in and I didn't say anything to him.
4120880	4122400	I don't have that kind of relationship with him.
4122400	4124480	I didn't say, sorry, I took a huge shit.
4124480	4133120	You might want to go get an insert shot on the fucking specs on the, uh, look, fuck you.
4133360	4134360	Fuck all of you.
4136360	4138680	I'm telling you my thought process.
4138680	4141960	I didn't, I didn't, I didn't welcome into that world, but I knew that he was probably
4141960	4146920	sitting there going, boy, why does meltdown comics smell like human fecal matter?
4146920	4149640	And I was just kind of sitting there thinking, I deserve this.
4149640	4154960	And then, and then a conversation came up between me and Neil and Aaron had an
4154960	4159600	emotional reaction to it and took me out to the parking lot that she wanted to talk
4159600	4162240	to me about, and that's why I wasn't in the room.
4162240	4167480	But otherwise I would have sat there and owned it and I was like, I deserved it.
4167480	4169840	And participated in our, in our, in our agony.
4170640	4174600	And then it was the only one I came back because it was what you know, how you leave
4174600	4179440	a room and then like, yeah, when you come, when it come back into it, it's like, holy
4179440	4181640	shit. Yeah, that's what I knew.
4181640	4182720	I had done a bad thing.
4185320	4189360	Maybe not a bad, bad thing, but we should, what, what, what was the, uh, what was the
4190080	4190920	we should bring Aaron out.
4191560	4193160	Aaron McGathey, join us.
4208280	4210720	Because honestly, I'll leave it up to you if you want to talk about it or not.
4210920	4214360	Really quick. You know, when all of your friends see a horror movie and they're like,
4214360	4216240	oh, God, you guys, this movie, it's so scary.
4216240	4218280	It's so terrifying. And you see it and you're like, I don't get it.
4218600	4220960	That was like me walking into the bathroom after you had shit.
4221440	4222720	I can't smell it anymore.
4224280	4226320	Wow. Stockholm syndrome.
4229560	4230560	Yeah.
4232600	4235640	You've, you've identified with the terrorism of Dan's asshole.
4238960	4240680	The parking lot incident.
4240720	4242080	I'm not a proud person.
4243320	4247240	I'm not proud of this, but I don't see Dan very often.
4247560	4252040	I was out of town and, uh, I heard about, uh, I,
4252280	4255800	whenever I see Dan, I'm always asking him, how was work? How's this thing?
4256280	4259040	How was your walk to the store? What was that, that thing?
4259040	4262800	And Dan's understandably tired and doesn't tell me things.
4262800	4267120	So Neil knew something that I didn't, that I was very excited about.
4267160	4270000	So I got bummed out because I felt like he didn't share with me.
4270160	4271720	I don't talk about work when I come home.
4272520	4273880	Like there's so much going on.
4273880	4278320	Like, like, like I, and I, I, I, I'm semi-conscious of how much I'm not telling
4278320	4279960	you, kind of a little bit.
4280000	4281000	It's not a big deal.
4281000	4284200	I just, I had a big reaction to it because I was like, well, I want to be
4284200	4286640	here. And it was sort of unexpected that Neil came in because Neil's making this
4286640	4289320	documentary. The Harman town is Neil.
4289360	4292240	The Harman town documentary. Neil Berkeley. Fantastic filmmaker.
4292480	4303400	The Harman town documentary is, uh, uh, sort of, it tracks Spencer a little bit.
4303840	4309080	As it should, Spencer is sort of a represental, a representative of, uh, fans
4309120	4310520	and, uh, I don't know, whatever.
4310560	4311160	He's interesting.
4311160	4312360	I'm a metaphor.
4316960	4319400	I mean, it really, it really has nothing to do with the documentary.
4319400	4320560	My, my feelings.
4320600	4321120	No, no, no.
4321120	4322120	I just wanted to know.
4322440	4324280	I'm not explaining anything about it.
4324280	4325320	Let's go to the parking lot.
4325440	4328720	I'm, I'm catching people up on something.
4329000	4334920	Uh, so because Neil's making this movie that has to do with Spencer, I told
4334920	4340760	Spencer, I think yesterday, uh, something that I hadn't told anybody, which was
4340760	4345440	that, uh, I had recently willy nilly in order to save myself some work.
4345440	4348080	I had cast Spencer in a role on community.
4348400	4354080	And so I told Neil, I said, Oh, Spencer's going to be shooting on, uh, next week.
4354320	4356120	So you could come for your documentary.
4356120	4357440	That would make a good final image.
4357680	4358240	Spencer.
4364880	4369080	So Jeff doesn't know that you guys don't know that Neil knew that yesterday.
4369080	4371440	And then Aaron was in the green room smelling my shit.
4371480	4373760	Dan, can I, can I go talk to you in the parking lot?
4375120	4380720	And I, and, and, and Aaron felt like she was like, she just feels locked out of my
4380720	4382000	life because we had been talking.
4382000	4382280	Yeah.
4382280	4383280	Cause I just don't see him.
4383280	4385320	It really has nothing to do with the information.
4385320	4387080	It could have been, it could have been anything.
4387920	4389560	Uh, it's really not a big deal.
4391240	4392400	It was a big deal at the time.
4392400	4393920	I mean, we, we had to go to the parking lot.
4393920	4400360	I just wanted to talk to, um, well, also because we had talked about it before.
4400600	4403000	Cause it was something that I was hoping was going to happen.
4403000	4405520	So I felt like I was the last person to know, but I guess I wasn't.
4405520	4406160	It's not a big deal.
4406200	4408800	So anyways, that's why I wasn't in there when you were smelling my shit.
4408840	4412800	It's because Aaron didn't know I cast Spencer.
4413760	4416040	Well, all right, whatever.
4416480	4416760	All right.
4418440	4419880	Now I feel weird.
4420000	4424520	Well, I understandably, so Spencer, it's just super, super not about you.
4424520	4426960	I just, I just felt, I'm making it about me.
4427440	4429080	No, no, please, please do.
4429440	4430520	Um, I feel embarrassed.
4430520	4431920	I feel a little, I don't know.
4431960	4433200	I'm kind of, I don't know.
4433240	4433720	Jealous.
4433720	4434400	A personal thing.
4435240	4441120	Um, no, I mean, I feel jealous of, I mean, because Dan, Dan works at community all
4441120	4444320	hours of the day, I feel, I feel a little thrown under the bus right now.
4444360	4446360	I didn't, I just want, I just want to talk to you.
4446360	4447920	It really has nothing to do with anything.
4448000	4450920	No, I don't, you, yeah, you didn't know that I had done this thing.
4451200	4451920	Lorraine Newman.
4451920	4452840	Come on up here.
4455080	4461800	Uh, the guy, the guy, the Lorraine Newman genie committed to a show.
4461840	4465320	No, I like, I like that guy.
4465560	4469720	Who's the guy I picture him as this giant bald, like Mr.
4469720	4473920	Clean, like white t-shirt guy with his arms folded, biceps as big as his head
4474000	4476800	going, no, no Lorraine Newman.
4478440	4481080	Um, all right, nine 25.
4482440	4483240	What does that mean?
4484320	4486720	I think it means, I think it means the dungeons are alive.
4487520	4490760	Wait, there's a gentleman in the front row handing Aaron a gift.
4492000	4492880	Oh, thank you.
4493120	4494080	It's like, it's a game.
4494080	4494440	It's a geek.
4494440	4494760	Okay.
4494760	4495680	Cause I like games.
4495720	4496320	Thank you, sir.
4497320	4498280	Is that a C?
4498280	4502120	I mean, this is a bummer.
4502120	4504480	I've been so happy all day and all week.
4504480	4505760	I mean, nothing is wrong.
4505760	4506720	I'm happy.
4509480	4511880	No one, no one watched the way that you can, you can, you can, you
4511880	4513320	can really feel the happiness.
4515560	4516360	No, I'm fine.
4516360	4518280	I know that's just Dan.
4518280	4521320	If it was my show, there'd be a whole thing with Dan in the parking lot.
4521320	4524760	And I'm just kidding.
4524800	4525560	It's totally fine.
4525880	4526520	Lorraine.
4526520	4532120	No, she promised you would be late tonight.
4534120	4536120	All right, Spencer, what's up you guys?
4536120	4540480	Why don't you hand out our character sheets and give the people what they may or
4540480	4545480	may not want a little D and D, but they go from the top down.
4545480	4549000	It's yours and then hers and then his, I know how character sheets go.
4549000	4553160	I mean, I see you pass them out every day and you clearly do not.
4557520	4557960	Yeah.
4557960	4559120	Let's nourish shine.
4559960	4562520	Thanks by the way, to Glenn cook for that earth shine.
4562600	4562960	Yeah.
4562960	4563240	Yeah.
4565640	4566560	Is the bottle still there?
4566920	4567240	Yeah.
4568240	4569560	Can we fire them in line that down to me?
4569560	4571160	I want to, uh, let us sniff up.
4571160	4571600	Sure.
4571640	4573720	Well, you could just say Instagram, the label.
4573840	4574280	It's great.
4576280	4577920	I love the concept of earth shine.
4578600	4582600	Spencer, you have all been hand that to, uh, pass me that booze.
4582600	4585960	Is that an Avery print?
4591480	4592160	Oh, Jeff.
4594680	4595520	Oh, Jeffrey.
4605920	4608000	Guys, he's been sober for 20 years.
4608000	4609320	It's a bad moment.
4610840	4612080	He lost his kids.
4613600	4617040	The camera blurs and becomes a documentary about Andy Dick.
4623440	4624040	Okay.
4624840	4626640	That go-up I took was ambitious.
4626680	4628960	No, that was, I saw bubbles come up.
4629000	4630720	I was like a Pepsi commercial.
4630720	4634560	Like you're done skateboarding time to take a swig.
4634600	4636400	How do you, how do you open that?
4637760	4639960	I'm going to fuck so many creatures at D and D.
4642600	4646920	I've got that moonshine rage going.
4649200	4650000	I just cringe.
4653560	4655120	Why are you looking at me this way?
4655720	4656840	You don't love me enough.
4659360	4661320	The show got white trashy real fast.
4666000	4667480	Spencer, if you would.
4667680	4668280	Okay.
4670080	4671520	Kumail's not here, I guess.
4671920	4673160	Yeah, he's always got call times.
4673160	4675280	He misses you guys so much and he'll be back as soon as we can.
4675280	4676280	I miss Kumail so much.
4676280	4677960	Are we casting a Christopergen this one?
4677960	4679480	Or are we playing throughout the threesies?
4681400	4682080	Wait, you?
4682400	4682880	What's your name?
4683600	4684000	Ian.
4684760	4685600	Ian, get up here.
4693720	4694760	Ian, I don't know you.
4694760	4696560	Do I do it?
4696960	4697480	I'm sorry, Ian.
4697480	4698080	How's it going, man?
4698840	4702320	Ian, I love this.
4707600	4711800	Ian, for our home listener, has a, has a colorful ball cap, but do rack.
4712520	4715360	He's a handsome black gentleman with a thin, thin mustache.
4715840	4717600	He's a friend of mine, too.
4717600	4718000	Oh, yeah?
4718000	4718400	Yeah.
4718400	4718960	A friend of yours?
4718960	4719160	Yeah.
4719160	4719920	You want to tell me why?
4720120	4723640	I was looking at character sheets when he came up, but I otherwise
4723640	4724800	I would have called it out earlier.
4724800	4725800	But what up, Ian?
4725880	4727240	How do you know Spencer?
4727520	4728680	Ian, how do you know Spencer?
4728720	4731560	I'm actually, I live in a house with his brother.
4732520	4733000	Wow.
4733000	4733200	Yeah.
4733200	4735520	So I've known, I've known Spencer for years.
4735520	4736160	Sounds freaky.
4736160	4736720	Oh, yeah.
4737280	4737720	All right.
4738040	4740680	You guys, I have the thin mustache because I was just in a play.
4741280	4742040	What play?
4742200	4743440	It's called Mickey and Worm.
4743440	4744680	It was a dinner theater play.
4744680	4747520	We played it in Oxnard at a place called The Kitchen.
4748120	4748520	All right.
4749040	4750440	Are you, yeah.
4750640	4752600	Can we, can we hear a little bit of that?
4753520	4754040	Yeah, let's do it.
4754040	4755040	We'll have like 10 lines.
4755040	4755840	I was a bartender.
4756040	4756640	Give me one line.
4757960	4761320	Here, here, Ian, let's do, you know all 10 of your lines.
4761800	4765800	You're going to do each of your 10 lines and I will be the other character.
4770920	4773360	In a segment we call dinner theater.
4776920	4780160	And in post, we're going to add in the sound of forks and plates.
4782360	4784080	The pet store is now open.
4784800	4788000	So I start off and I'm like, I have to get my voice.
4791200	4794000	I'm like, welcome to Lou Atwater's Club Royale.
4794000	4795720	This is circa 1940.
4795720	4797520	Thank you guys for coming out tonight.
4797600	4798400	What do you have?
4798720	4801560	Ah, I would like a vodka and soda, please.
4801560	4802160	Thank you.
4803200	4804760	Then the next line is like, Mago?
4804800	4805920	Which one was Mago?
4809240	4811240	Don't you ever say that name to me again.
4815080	4816080	Listen to me.
4816080	4817080	Listen to me.
4817800	4819640	Don't look around while I tell you this.
4819640	4822560	I'm passing the schematics for a jet pack across the bar.
4823680	4826080	Okay, but I was here last night.
4826080	4827080	When did you fire her?
4828080	4829080	It doesn't matter.
4830480	4833080	If the Nazis get ahold of it, we're all dead.
4834480	4835880	Right, boss.
4840680	4841880	I'll meet you in back.
4841880	4843880	I'll be the one with a monkey on my shoulder.
4844880	4845680	You got it.
4852080	4854280	I want this to go on for the rest of my life.
4855280	4856280	I think we should end there.
4856280	4857280	Yeah, we'll stop it there.
4858280	4859280	It's probably better.
4865280	4867680	Ian, that was very satisfying for all concerned.
4869280	4871880	Are you familiar with Camille's character, Christoperge?
4871880	4873080	I am familiar.
4873080	4876280	He likes to throw a knife with a string attached.
4876280	4876680	Correct.
4876680	4877480	He has a ribbon dagger.
4877480	4878480	Now he's a rogue.
4878480	4879880	I have no idea how to read this though.
4879880	4880480	Don't worry about it.
4880480	4881280	Follow your heart, Ian.
4881280	4884680	He's a rogue.
4884680	4885480	He's a thief.
4885480	4886480	He's good at picking locks.
4886480	4887280	He likes trouble.
4887280	4892080	And he's very cautious about tying weapons to strings and shit.
4892080	4892480	Yeah.
4892480	4894280	All right, Spencer, one more time, if you will.
4894280	4895280	Take us back to the...
4895280	4896480	He likes trouble.
4898080	4899080	He loves trouble.
4899480	4900080	Here we are.
4904080	4912880	When we last met, our heroes had slain Brefine as Metal Web in Darkstar's evil lair.
4912880	4913680	That's right.
4913680	4921680	They climbed up and out of the lava to higher ground before surveying their surroundings above.
4921680	4926080	They were in a new room full of horrifically slaughtered corpses.
4926080	4929680	The dead bodies of Admiral Darkstar's Dark Cultist.
4929680	4932880	Then, coincidentally, Yurch the Knoll showed up.
4932880	4937880	The smelly savage was acting suspiciously, drawing the attention of Quark and Sharpie.
4937880	4942880	Using powerful magic, Sharpie read the Knoll's mind and discovered his evil thoughts.
4942880	4946280	Apparently, Yurch had been practicing blood magic.
4946280	4951880	He used his blood magic to attack the party, but the aparti tacked back.
4951880	4954880	Whatever.
4954880	4958280	After dodging his blood spells, Quark let loose a...
4958280	4964880	Yeah, Quark let loose a mighty farsword blast that cut Yurch clean in two, slaying the evil Knoll.
4964880	4967880	But as the party headed onward, a voice rang out.
4967880	4971280	You'll pay for what you've done to our blood brother.
4971280	4977280	Swore a shadowy figure in the darkness, but before the gang could pursue this figure, it dispersed.
4977280	4982880	Confused, our heroes charged up the stairs and into the top of Darkstar's dark tower,
4982880	4987680	where they found the man himself, Admiral Darkstar.
4988280	4990280	Cut the music.
4992280	4994280	Sweet.
4994280	4999280	Yes, so you just ran up to the top of these stairs and you see in the middle of this room,
4999280	5005280	you don't see anything but a massive pillar of black crystal and standing atop that black crystal.
5005280	5012280	His Admiral Darkstar, fully clad in his black-plated armor and a black cape on his body,
5012280	5015280	and he screams out at you as soon as you come up.
5015280	5020280	You fools have played right into my plan.
5020280	5024280	I mean, I knew it would be easy to get you to gather all the shards,
5024280	5028280	but I never expected you to bring them right to my lair.
5028280	5034280	Now I will collect your shards and honor Sharana Dawn of the Darkstar.
5034280	5036280	Oh boy.
5040280	5041280	I'll field this.
5041280	5042280	Okay.
5045280	5048280	Admiral, can I call you Dark?
5050280	5053280	Have I got bad news for you?
5055280	5058280	Kind of gave all our shards away on the way here.
5058280	5060280	You don't have them?
5060280	5065280	Yeah, here's the thing about elaborate plans like yours.
5067280	5073280	They involved too much choice on the part of the people being torn in.
5073280	5077280	On the way here, we felt like we needed skeletons.
5077280	5078280	Well, no matter.
5078280	5084280	I still have the manpower to dispatch you easily.
5084280	5086280	Dark minions, I beckon.
5086280	5089280	Come upstairs and protect me.
5089280	5091280	Admiral Darkstar, this is-
5091280	5094280	Where are my dark minions?
5094280	5099280	Is there a dark minion who can speak for you at a lower register?
5100280	5105280	I love the way you're talking, but-
5105280	5109280	Hey, Mulrain, don't give him notes.
5109280	5113280	Speaking of notes, have you guys seen Anatoly's-
5113280	5115280	Have we talked about this?
5115280	5116280	The fact that he's-
5116280	5117280	Legs?
5117280	5118280	I love it.
5118280	5121280	Anatoly is fully reclined on the stage.
5121280	5122280	That is really-
5122280	5124280	And now he's fully reclined on the stage.
5124280	5126280	Anatoly, are you in show business?
5126280	5127280	You are?
5127280	5128280	Okay.
5128280	5129280	Watch that one.
5129280	5130280	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5130280	5131280	Admiral Darkstar.
5131280	5134280	Yeah, he was screaming some stuff.
5134280	5139280	All right, so you were looking for your dark minions, sir?
5139280	5141280	Yes.
5141280	5144280	Probably don't have any.
5144280	5147280	World's worst trap.
5149280	5152280	No shards for you.
5152280	5154280	About to kill you now.
5154280	5156280	Do we have our skeleton army with us still, Spencer?
5156280	5158280	No, they got devoured by lava.
5158280	5159280	Oh, shit.
5159280	5160280	Yeah.
5160280	5161280	So it's just us.
5161280	5165280	Listen, let me ask you this, Admiral Darkstar.
5165280	5170280	Who makes a guy like you, Admiral?
5170280	5173280	I declare myself-
5173280	5175280	Oh, well, pleased to meet you.
5175280	5180280	I'm general gonna kick your ass.
5180280	5182280	Four stars.
5183280	5186280	And I am Major Bummer.
5186280	5189280	And I am Colonel Creative Murder.
5189280	5192280	Coming up the top of the stairs where you guys are.
5192280	5196280	You see one of Darkstar's dark cultists coming up the stairs.
5196280	5197280	He's out of breath.
5197280	5198280	Hey.
5198280	5199280	Hey.
5199280	5200280	He's right among you guys.
5200280	5201280	Dark cultist.
5201280	5202280	Hold it right there.
5202280	5203280	He stops.
5203280	5205280	I kick him in the chest.
5205280	5206280	No, no, no, no.
5206280	5208280	I already did it.
5208280	5209280	All right.
5209280	5210280	Okay.
5210280	5211280	All right.
5211280	5215280	This is my only minion.
5215280	5218280	Dark cultist.
5218280	5222280	I'm gonna make a proposition to you.
5222280	5227280	We got a situation in front of us here that I want you to look around and do the math.
5227280	5230280	Admiral Darkstar's about to get his ass kicked.
5230280	5234280	Be our dark cultist.
5234280	5239280	To explain why I just kicked him in the chest, I kick my friends in the chest, too.
5239280	5240280	Yeah.
5240280	5241280	She's...
5241280	5243280	Right, guys?
5243280	5246280	Thank you.
5246280	5253280	I take a Dan Harmon style shit to fill the room with intimidation.
5253280	5257280	The dark minion is out of breath from coming up all these stairs.
5257280	5260280	But he's like, Jesus Christ, you guys, did you see down there?
5260280	5264280	There's a bunch of bodies and they are all ripped to shreds and there is blood in buckets.
5264280	5265280	Yeah.
5265280	5266280	That was us.
5266280	5267280	We did that.
5267280	5268280	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5269280	5271280	He faints.
5271280	5272280	He faints.
5272280	5274280	Oh, boy.
5274280	5276280	He fainted.
5276280	5278280	My dark army!
5278280	5281280	No!
5281280	5286280	Your dark army was one guy that faints at the sight of blood?
5286280	5289280	Apparently.
5289280	5291280	Oh, Admiral.
5291280	5293280	Black tentacle Jack!
5293280	5300280	He raises his arms and black shadowy ropes bind you guys or try to bite you guys by the arms.
5300280	5303280	Let's see if that happens.
5303280	5307280	You know, sometimes when you talk to a villain, he'll attack you guys.
5307280	5308280	That happens.
5308280	5312280	So, everyone but Christoper gets caught by these ropes.
5312280	5313280	Damn right.
5313280	5315280	Blackie, blackie bites.
5315280	5316280	Damn right.
5316280	5317280	Yeah.
5317280	5321280	Black tentacles can't touch this.
5322280	5324280	No black on black violence on this one.
5324280	5325280	Exactly.
5326280	5327280	Yeah.
5327280	5328280	That happens.
5328280	5329280	Can I throw a bull at him?
5329280	5330280	Whatever you guys want to do.
5330280	5331280	A bull?
5331280	5332280	No, no.
5332280	5333280	A bulla.
5333280	5334280	Yeah.
5334280	5335280	Not like a bulla or something.
5335280	5337280	A bulla what?
5337280	5338280	Spaghetti.
5338280	5340280	I throw a bull at him.
5340280	5341280	All right.
5341280	5342280	Oh, shit.
5342280	5344280	I got to roll this dice.
5344280	5345280	Okay.
5345280	5346280	You hit him in the legs.
5346280	5348280	It catches his legs.
5348280	5350280	He falls off the crystal onto his face.
5350280	5351280	Fuck yeah.
5353280	5354280	Well done.
5355280	5358280	He takes six falling damage.
5360280	5361280	Bulla.
5366280	5367280	All right.
5367280	5368280	Camille's out of a job.
5370280	5372280	I've always wanted to replace Camille.
5372280	5373280	Yeah.
5375280	5377280	In my craft box...
5377280	5378280	Yeah.
5381280	5383280	Do I...
5383280	5384280	I don't know.
5384280	5388280	In my craft box, do I have any tacks?
5388280	5389280	Yes.
5389280	5390280	Okay.
5390280	5396280	I spit tacks at the rope.
5396280	5398280	At what?
5398280	5400280	At the rope that's binding us.
5400280	5401280	Okay.
5401280	5402280	There are tens of goals.
5402280	5403280	Tacks are...
5403280	5404280	That's a terrible idea.
5404280	5405280	I'm realizing.
5405280	5407280	Do I have any broken glass?
5408280	5410280	You should have like a knife.
5414280	5416280	Mulrain, you have actual weapons.
5418280	5420280	Designed for hurting other things.
5420280	5421280	Right.
5421280	5425280	Mulrain realizes that she's not going to win with using crafts.
5427280	5429280	Yeah, that was my brain shattering.
5429280	5434280	I pull the knife out of my knife holder sheath,
5434280	5437280	and I start hacking away at the ropes.
5437280	5438280	All right.
5438280	5439280	Tentacles.
5439280	5441280	You managed to hack your minds away.
5441280	5442280	Rope tentacles.
5443280	5444280	You're free.
5444280	5445280	Oh, nice.
5445280	5446280	There.
5448280	5450280	Now that's a crowd reaction.
5452280	5454280	Now that's not some crowd reaction.
5456280	5457280	Nor was that.
5459280	5460280	Why did...
5460280	5461280	Whatever.
5461280	5463280	How tall is Admiral Darkstar?
5463280	5465280	He's a good six feet.
5465280	5466280	I climb on his head.
5470280	5474280	Yeah, he's like on his face right now on the ground.
5474280	5476280	Well, perfect.
5478280	5479280	Even easier.
5479280	5481280	Where are these tentacles that are holding us...
5481280	5483280	They're coming out of the very ground itself.
5483280	5484280	All right.
5484280	5487280	I try to grapple my way through and use my brute strength to get free.
5487280	5489280	I got to put it at Dan's turn.
5489280	5490280	Oh, sorry.
5490280	5491280	After Mulrain climbs the top.
5491280	5494280	Let me ask you a question about the armlet of spring.
5494280	5495280	Sure.
5495280	5497280	Which I have always had on my arm.
5497280	5500280	And I have never until now asked you about.
5500280	5503280	Its power being to entangle.
5503280	5504280	Yeah.
5504280	5508280	Could I assume control of an entangling vine?
5508280	5509280	It's not really a vine.
5509280	5510280	All right.
5510280	5511280	Okay.
5512280	5515280	I just drank 130 proof.
5516280	5517280	Nice saw.
5517280	5518280	That was impressive.
5518280	5519280	It was really good.
5519280	5520280	All right.
5520280	5521280	Well, then I'll...
5521280	5524280	I can't cast reduce person on myself, can I?
5524280	5525280	You could.
5525280	5529280	And it slipped out of the serpentine grasp of these things?
5529280	5530280	Sure.
5530280	5531280	All right.
5531280	5533280	Reductum selfum.
5536280	5539280	Reducing yourself to a gnome sized size.
5539280	5545280	You quickly jump out of your binds and away from the grasping tentacles.
5550280	5552280	So it's a dark start.
5552280	5555280	He tries to get up with Mulrain on him.
5557280	5559280	Do you want to try to like hold him down or?
5559280	5560280	Yeah.
5560280	5561280	Yeah, for sure.
5564280	5567280	I try to make him think that he's in a...
5567280	5568280	All right.
5568280	5569280	I'm just going to punish myself.
5569280	5571280	I'm going to complete my sentence.
5573280	5578280	I'm going to try to make him think that he's in a different biome by the way that I am
5578280	5580280	sitting on his head.
5581280	5582280	Wait.
5582280	5583280	Take that to me.
5584280	5585280	Come again?
5586280	5590280	I want him to believe that he's in a different place.
5591280	5592280	Let's see.
5592280	5593280	Roll it.
5593280	5594280	Wait, what?
5595280	5597280	He tries to pull himself up and goes,
5597280	5600280	I feel like I'm in a swamp or some bio.
5602280	5604280	It's nothing to brag about.
5605280	5608280	And he tries to get up, but he doesn't.
5608280	5613280	So instead he kind of swings his arm and tries to punch you in the kidney.
5614280	5615280	Tries.
5615280	5618280	Little does he know I have no kidneys.
5618280	5621280	Well, either that or he just missed.
5621280	5625280	But in any case, your kidneys are fine.
5625280	5628280	They've not been impacted by anything.
5628280	5629280	Great.
5629280	5630280	I continue to sit on his face.
5630280	5631280	I like that.
5632280	5634280	Putting it at Jeff's turn.
5634280	5637280	I go into a barbarian rage to get myself free from these tentacles.
5637280	5638280	All right.
5638280	5642280	Throwing yourself into a barbarian rage, you strain against your binds.
5644280	5645280	Yeah.
5645280	5646280	You free yourself.
5646280	5647280	Yeah.
5650280	5651280	Thank you.
5651280	5652280	Thank you for that.
5652280	5654280	Do I have an action now?
5654280	5659280	Yeah, you burst forth in a show of energy that, you know, was really fast style.
5660280	5664280	I take my mighty sword and I slash at Admiral Darkstar.
5665280	5666280	All right.
5666280	5670280	You charge at Admiral Darkstar and slash with your mighty sword.
5671280	5673280	And you critically fail.
5673280	5674280	Oops.
5675280	5681280	So running towards him, you swing your sword back and you let go of it.
5681280	5683280	And it just flies behind your back.
5684280	5688280	Being a gnome, this weight difference affects you greatly.
5688280	5695280	And you topple onto your face and you do like three somersault kind of spins before landing on your back.
5696280	5697280	Wow.
5698280	5701280	I get up and I go, whoopsie.
5702280	5705280	You take three damage from skidding on the glass.
5705280	5706280	Jesus Christ.
5706280	5707280	All right.
5707280	5708280	I have a quick question.
5708280	5711280	So if I have this, what is bluefin poison?
5712280	5713280	Is that like bad sushi?
5714280	5717280	Well, it's more like a puffer fish.
5718280	5719280	Can I put that on my knife?
5719280	5720280	Yup.
5720280	5721280	Sweet.
5721280	5723280	You can do anything you want in this game.
5727280	5728280	Yeah.
5728280	5730280	Give him a sneak attack and zero rogue.
5730280	5737280	So I'm going to sneak attack this guy with the bluefin poison on my knife.
5738280	5741280	Houston poison dagger to my heart.
5743280	5754280	Attacking at his back with your poison dagger, you plunge it directly between two, you know, plates of his armor, thrusting it into the spot where his meat is.
5759280	5760280	Wow.
5760280	5761280	That's not cool.
5761280	5763280	Well, I mean, that's what Christoper does, right?
5763280	5766280	I'm calling my meat dagger for a reason.
5766280	5767280	He is right for the meat.
5768280	5769280	Dealing.
5769280	5771280	Well, it's five divided by two.
5771280	5772280	Round it down.
5773280	5774280	Thank you.
5774280	5780280	Two damage plus sneak attack damage, which is four, four and five.
5780280	5781280	What's that you guys?
5781280	5783280	Thirteen, fifteen damage.
5787280	5792280	He doesn't seem too bothered by the poison for whatever reason, but otherwise has been hurt.
5793280	5794280	Never saw it coming.
5794280	5795280	All eyes and teeth.
5796280	5797280	Sorry.
5797280	5798280	I'm super racist.
5801280	5802280	Must be nice.
5809280	5810280	Black people problems.
5812280	5813280	I know, I know.
5816280	5820280	I mean, if I'm racist for one second, it's like, it's okay.
5820280	5821280	I give you permission.
5821280	5822280	I'll even give you a black card.
5822280	5823280	Do you want one?
5826280	5827280	What would I do with that?
5827280	5834280	Would I just like imply for one minute that I just give it, just give it back to the arresting officer.
5834280	5835280	Just say, I don't need it.
5835280	5836280	I don't need it.
5840280	5841280	I like this.
5842280	5843280	I'm enjoying this.
5847280	5849280	I'll put it at more instant now.
5849280	5850280	Okay.
5851280	5868280	From my position, I take two of my arrows and I, because I'm sitting on his head, I take my two arrows and I try to stab them through his ears into his brain.
5874280	5875280	That's a combat maneuver.
5876280	5877280	That is a combat maneuver.
5877280	5879280	It's called the brain poke.
5881280	5883280	The brain poke.
5884280	5885280	Brain poke!
5888280	5890280	I don't know how I could possibly miss.
5891280	5895280	Well, I mean, in this case, it would be because he's wearing a helmet.
5899280	5901280	No, no, I guess you mistook my meeting.
5901280	5904280	You hit with one of your arrows in his head, but not the other.
5905280	5911280	So one of them pierces through his helmeted head and stabs him right in the ear, right ear?
5911280	5914280	Yeah, yeah, but inside is inside, inside.
5914280	5919280	Yeah, and goes through the ear into his head parts.
5920280	5921280	To his brain.
5921280	5922280	To his head meat.
5923280	5924280	Right into his head meat, yeah.
5924280	5928280	And maybe now he's like the cheerleader who can only run backwards.
5931280	5932280	You know what I mean?
5932280	5933280	Gotta love that H1N1.
5933280	5935280	Yeah, he can't sing anymore or something.
5935280	5936280	I like that.
5937280	5938280	But that doesn't happen to him.
5939280	5941280	He just gets hit for six damage.
5942280	5943280	All right.
5945280	5946280	I'll take it.
5946280	5948280	Blood flows out of his ear.
5948280	5949280	I drink it.
5952280	5953280	That's what you guys were thinking, right?
5954280	5955280	I spit it on my face.
5955280	5958280	I write like a big okay on my forehead.
5960280	5961280	Oh, God.
5964280	5965280	Mulrain.
5966280	5967280	Have more moonshine.
5969280	5970280	Earthshine, sorry.
5970280	5972280	You're gonna need to see a doctor after this.
5976280	5978280	That's Dan's turn, then.
5978280	5979280	All right, Sharpie.
5979280	5983280	So I have this level three spell, and it's called Major Image.
5984280	5986280	Illusion with sound, smell, and heat.
5986280	5987280	Yeah.
5988280	5989280	So that's a pretty convincing...
5990280	5992280	I think you cast that in the great room before the show.
5993280	5994280	All right.
6000280	6002280	You dealt my nose 14 damage.
6006280	6008280	It was a critical shift.
6011280	6012280	That's our show, right?
6012280	6013280	That's our show?
6024280	6025280	That's our show!
6032280	6033280	That's the end of Harman Town.
6034280	6035280	That's his show.
6037280	6038280	Critical shift!
6038280	6039280	That's been our show. Good night.
6041280	6042280	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
6045280	6046280	They want it out of here.
6047280	6049280	But that's the show title, for sure, right?
6050280	6051280	It was a critical shift.
6052280	6053280	It was a monster shift.
6062280	6071280	I want to create an illusion of a woman that looks 20 years older than Admiral Darkstar
6071280	6075280	but has kind of his face in a bathrobe.
6078280	6079280	That is disturbing.
6080280	6082280	And I want to make her go,
6083280	6084280	Stop it!
6085280	6086280	What are you doing?
6089280	6090280	You made a mess!
6091280	6092280	Go to bed!
6095280	6098280	Did you make your little penis pee again?
6102280	6103280	I'll bite it off!
6105280	6106280	With my dentures!
6110280	6112280	Go back to your Darkstar bed!
6113280	6118280	Dan, I want to take this moment to thank you for reading my how to play D&D instruction manual.
6120280	6121280	I appreciate it.
6124280	6125280	So that's what you're doing?
6125280	6127280	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right in front of him.
6130280	6131280	Oh, God, man. Be careful.
6131280	6134280	Don't just take alcohol. That's weird.
6136280	6137280	He's getting out of here alive.
6138280	6140280	Yeah, that's going to be great.
6141280	6142280	I need somebody to drive me home.
6143280	6145280	We got an all Uber tonight.
6146280	6147280	Oh, that's good.
6148280	6150280	The Earthshine is making its rounds again.
6151280	6152280	Guys, remember when Jeff said critical shift?
6153280	6155280	That was so good.
6160280	6161280	Bask in it.
6162280	6163280	That's right.
6168280	6170280	Psh, psh, psh, psh, psh, psh.
6176280	6182280	I remember when I made that guy's fictional mom yelling at him for peeing.
6183280	6184280	Do it, do it!
6184280	6202280	Dan, are you talking about the fictional mom that threatened to bite off her son's penis with her dangerous?
6203280	6204280	Yeah.
6205280	6206280	Just checking.
6206280	6209280	A little bit of Red Dragon, a little bit of autobiography in there.
6210280	6212280	I'll let you figure out which.
6213280	6214280	Sorry, so.
6215280	6216280	Spencer, have you rolled that?
6216280	6218280	What? No, no, no.
6219280	6220280	He cast Angry Mommy Memory.
6220280	6221280	Yeah, come on.
6222280	6223280	Angry Mommy Memory.
6224280	6227280	Yeah, so you come real dark star. You knock it off.
6228280	6231280	He looks at this illusion and he's like, I don't have a mom.
6234280	6238280	I mean, it's, it's, yeah, I'm not going to give you my battery.
6239280	6240280	He says that out loud.
6241280	6242280	I go, everyone has a mom.
6243280	6245280	Well, maybe you didn't know yours.
6246280	6251280	Maybe you don't understand the cosmology of all the different planes in the multiverse.
6252280	6261280	Maybe, maybe, maybe I don't, but maybe the one thing that all of them share is that everyone comes from a mama.
6262280	6266280	And maybe when you don't know yours, you get a little angry.
6267280	6272280	And you want to make the cosmology more significant than it is when it really comes down to simple realities.
6273280	6274280	Right, Gertrude?
6275280	6276280	And then I make her go, that's right.
6277280	6278280	This little shit.
6280280	6281280	Go to your room.
6282280	6286280	And I go, if you didn't know her, I just, I think that that suggests.
6288280	6292280	Sharpie, maybe he'd remember better if you sang your song.
6293280	6294280	Everybody comes from a mama.
6295280	6297280	It's a great song. It's a great song. I've heard it.
6298280	6300280	Anyway, I'll just, just, just roll for it.
6301280	6302280	Yeah.
6303280	6304280	I don't want to negate that, but it'll just be bad.
6305280	6306280	I'll drop you a beat if you want.
6307280	6308280	Here we go.
6309280	6310280	He's going to drop a beat.
6311280	6312280	Angry mama memory rap.
6318280	6321280	Everybody comes from a mama.
6322280	6325280	Every mama's going to have a son.
6327280	6335280	Everybody needs a friend sometimes, and everybody wants to lean on someone.
6336280	6340280	So when you call me, don't expect to reply.
6341280	6346280	And when you fall for me, don't expect me to ply my wares.
6346280	6349280	Cause baby, I came to the bar and I couldn't find you.
6350280	6352280	What, what you doing? Two shots and that's through.
6353280	6354280	You fucking that guy again.
6355280	6356280	I took you to the tennis court.
6357280	6359280	I lost again. I put the ball over the net.
6360280	6362280	I fucked your mama so hard, she came away wet.
6363280	6364280	Fucked your daddy in his ass.
6368280	6371280	Cause everybody has a mama's baby.
6372280	6375280	And every mama's baby has a friend.
6377280	6382280	And every dark star needs an admiral in its navy.
6383280	6386280	And everybody is alone in the end.
6387280	6389280	Admiral Darkstar.
6394280	6397280	That's our show everybody. Thank you for coming to Heart of Town.
6400280	6401280	Let's give it up for Ian.
6401280	6408280	That was some good beatboxing. That was some very good beatboxing.
6409280	6413280	Thank you Jesus, Adam Goldberg, Glenn Cook for your fantastic earth shine.
6414280	6416280	All of you for coming. Everybody here at Meltdown.
6417280	6422280	One more time for Spencer Crittenden, Aaron McGathey.
6424280	6427280	I'm Jeff. One more time for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6432280	6433280	This is empty.
6435280	6438280	Somebody call us all in Uber. Nobody drive home tonight.
