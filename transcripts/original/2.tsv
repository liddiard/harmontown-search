0	10680	Good evening, Harmanians, Harmanianettes, Heary Heary, welcome to the best night of
10680	13120	your lives.
13120	20360	Let's welcome the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
20360	29960	Thank you, wow, what a crowd.
30960	35960	I'd like to welcome and thank our acting comptroller, Erin McGathey.
35960	41960	Hi, I'm very nervous and insecure.
41960	42960	Don't be alarmed.
42960	44960	Jeff just texted me.
44960	48960	If you're on stage right now, turn off your phone.
48960	49960	I'm already failing.
49960	53960	Well, with advice like that flowing in, how can you?
53960	58960	Don't worry, Erin also is my acting girlfriend.
59960	62960	We've talked about it on the drive up here.
62960	68960	We're both absolute consummate preparationists.
68960	69960	We simply just, we really...
69960	71960	So we said that we invented a word.
71960	72960	Yes.
72960	76960	We actually sat down and said, what will the word be for people who prepare a lot?
76960	78960	And we said, let's stutter as we say it.
78960	79960	Right.
79960	81960	It was all planned out, every experience.
81960	85960	This is the inception of talking.
85960	86960	Everything's planned out.
86960	89960	You'll record it and you'll go back over and go, no, the van backed over as they were
89960	92960	slaloming, which works perfectly.
92960	93960	What a jag movie.
93960	94960	Can we admit?
94960	95960	No?
95960	98960	Oh, okay, no, all right.
98960	99960	All right.
99960	100960	Hey, man.
100960	101960	I am not Napoleon.
101960	103960	I am a populist.
103960	104960	I'm Obama.
104960	108960	If you don't like something, I like it.
108960	111960	Inception.
111960	113960	Three dreams at the same time.
113960	114960	Couple notes.
114960	122960	They start that movie two dreams deep.
122960	125960	I wish I could use the N word.
125960	126960	Please.
126960	130960	It's a fucking movie about dreams being real.
130960	132960	Give me a taste.
132960	137960	I don't assume I'm stupid, but...
137960	140960	It's dramatic music.
140960	142960	But step into it.
142960	145960	Every pool has stairs.
145960	148960	You just wander in.
148960	154960	Show me an example of a dream and a guy being in the dream.
154960	156960	Hey, man, you enjoying that soup?
156960	157960	Yes, I am.
157960	158960	It's delicious.
158960	159960	You know what I love about it.
159960	160960	It's so real.
160960	162960	Psych.
162960	163960	You're dreaming.
163960	168960	Ah, ah, ah, I thought that soup was real.
168960	172960	So, in conclusion, sir, I think you could use my services.
172960	174960	You're hired.
174960	178960	It's the way that you use it.
178960	180960	And then do the credits.
180960	184960	And then in the credits, like, reveal, like, okay, there's a little call to adventure.
184960	186960	Like, we're two dreams deep.
186960	192960	And then have the threshold be, we need to go three dreams deep, baby.
192960	193960	Or three deep.
193960	196960	That's never charismatic when you, like, forget the R in dreams.
197960	200960	That makes all of you go, I should be up there.
200960	203960	I can say the word dreams.
203960	207960	Well, the wizards behind the curtain no longer.
207960	212960	The emperor's clothes are here.
212960	215960	Which is the name of your autobiography.
215960	217960	Both of those things.
217960	218960	I got a little sidetracked.
218960	222960	And I want to make a promise to you that's not going to happen tonight.
223960	228960	Harmontown is, for those of you who have not been here nine, ten times we've done this,
228960	230960	it's a town meeting.
230960	233960	I think that's very clear from the description of the show,
233960	236960	which is now going to be a weekly podcast.
236960	240960	And, yeah, it seems like that deserves applause.
240960	244960	It's a thing that seems like when a comic says, I just had a baby.
244960	246960	And then half the time they didn't.
246960	248960	You ever notice that?
248960	251960	You notice in comics, they always say they had babies,
251960	254960	and then they're just taking you for a fucking ride.
254960	259960	I had a baby, and you go, where do you go, AIDS?
259960	262960	Thanks, Dana Gould.
262960	264960	You didn't have a baby, Dana Gould.
264960	268960	Dan does exclusively observational comic, comic humor.
268960	269960	Yeah.
269960	273960	In keeping with my meta-sensibility, they got me fired.
273960	275960	I'm a comics comic.
275960	277960	Comics, comics, comics.
277960	282960	It's like the first scene of Inception.
282960	286960	Hard to follow, labyrinthine.
286960	287960	You know, like Back to the Future.
287960	288960	No.
288960	292960	That movie started with a kid who wasn't time-traveling.
292960	294960	I don't mean to shake my cane at you.
294960	297960	Christopher Nolan?
297960	299960	Did he direct that?
299960	300960	I don't know.
300960	303960	David Finchman?
303960	304960	Batman?
304960	305960	Who directed it?
305960	306960	It doesn't matter.
306960	312960	Let's hear it for Back to the Future.
312960	315960	Tonight we wanted to, the concern was that Aaron is stepping in for Jeff
315960	320960	so that the night would, my fear with people that are couples,
320960	322960	entertaining people, is that it will devolve very quickly
322960	325960	into a kind of Regis and Kathy thing.
325960	328960	Whereas you youngsters, Regis and Kelly.
328960	331960	You love me so much, so you were worried you were going to be
331960	333960	distracted by my beautiful face.
333960	335960	You're going to be saccharine.
335960	337960	Remember that time you did that?
337960	339960	No, you didn't.
339960	342960	I think.
342960	346960	But, you know, so I want to, I think that saying that out loud
346960	348960	will keep that from happening.
348960	349960	I'm probably wrong.
349960	350960	Let's forget it.
350960	351960	Okay.
351960	352960	For now.
352960	355960	You're so cute tonight.
355960	356960	You look very handsome.
356960	359960	Look how thin Dan looks.
359960	360960	See, it's not happening.
360960	362960	This isn't a morning show.
362960	364960	You all should see how thin he looks underneath those clothes.
364960	368960	I see how he looks naked.
368960	371960	Because we're dating and we're so in love.
371960	373960	Am I doing this right?
373960	378960	You gave me a flashback to this morning when we were having breakfast
378960	380960	and then breakfast turned into like 3 p.m.
380960	381960	Breakfast on each other's bits.
381960	382960	I'm sorry.
382960	387960	I'm sorry.
387960	389960	We were having breakfast this morning.
389960	391960	Somebody said, oh, you look like you lost weight
391960	395960	and then I lifted up my, I went like that.
395960	397960	That's what the guy at the bar did.
397960	399960	Except you can do it.
399960	400960	You're fine.
400960	401960	I love you guys.
401960	402960	But this guy did it.
402960	404960	I was like, you know, I got up out of a booth at a restaurant
404960	406960	and then somebody said, oh, you let go.
406960	407960	Where'd it go?
407960	408960	Where's the tummy?
408960	409960	And I said, here it is.
409960	412960	And this guy at the bar went, he was talking to his friend
412960	415960	and so you have to, I have to, you have to rewind,
415960	417960	put the playhead where I lift the shirt
417960	419960	and you'll know where I do it.
419960	420960	But I'm rewinding.
420960	423960	Now you're from, this is like Inception.
423960	426960	Knock your chair over.
426960	427960	Whoa.
427960	430960	That always wakes you up.
430960	432960	What are the suitcases with the things?
432960	434960	Come on, guys.
434960	436960	What is Ellen Page's role in that whole movie?
436960	437960	She's learning how to do it.
437960	439960	She never does it.
439960	440960	She never does it.
440960	443960	We're alienating them, honey.
443960	444960	They love Inception.
444960	446960	I love, I thought that was great.
446960	449960	A lot of them left a lot of Rotten Tomatoes reviews
449960	452960	that they're deeply ashamed of,
452960	455960	but they got to fucking stick it out.
455960	458960	Three years later, you can't fucking let it go.
458960	460960	You're the same way about Goodwill hunting,
460960	463960	you little fuckers.
463960	465960	How many of you own it?
465960	466960	Did you buy it?
466960	467960	Fuck you, buddy.
467960	468960	I'm sorry.
468960	469960	No.
469960	472960	I'm sorry.
472960	473960	I'm sorry.
473960	474960	Mixed signals.
474960	475960	I'm sorry.
475960	478960	Thank you for being honest.
478960	480960	Fuck you for lying, all of you,
480960	482960	because none of you own it.
482960	483960	Wait.
483960	484960	No, you were all honest, too.
484960	485960	You didn't raise your hands.
485960	487960	Thank you all for being honest.
487960	488960	Fuck me for not liking Goodwill hunting.
488960	489960	It's a great movie.
489960	491960	Listen to the name.
491960	494960	You like those apples?
494960	495960	Hey, hey.
495960	496960	No, answer the question.
496960	499960	Do you like apples?
499960	500960	I...
500960	503960	Fuck you, you fucking dork.
503960	504960	So we're at Little Docs and you...
504960	505960	No, no, no.
505960	506960	Just answer it.
506960	508960	Okay, yes, I like apples, which...
508960	511960	Okay, you're putting me in the awkward position
511960	513960	of having a stance on fucking apples.
513960	516960	You're an idiot, but yes, I like apples.
516960	518960	I just got a phone number.
518960	520960	How you doing?
520960	521960	I don't...
521960	525960	Please, you're embarrassing yourself, me, my parents,
525960	531960	humanity, giraffes, any errant spy drones passing over.
531960	532960	Every...
532960	534960	The thermograph of you is embarrassing.
534960	538960	Holding a phone number, bragging about it with the apple tea up.
538960	539960	Fuck you.
539960	540960	It's not...
540960	542960	You don't give that movie an Oscar.
542960	545960	What you get from that is 10 more movies like that.
545960	548960	Saving the Rebecca's Dreaming.
548960	550960	Good silvering up.
550960	554960	Logline, logline for saving the Rebecca's Dreaming.
554960	556960	Rebecca is a small-town girl who's been in the big city.
556960	557960	She's coming back.
557960	558960	They don't have loglines.
558960	560960	They're fucking pieces of shit.
560960	563960	All they have is a special font that looks like on Golden Pond.
563960	564960	That's all they have.
564960	567960	Good will hunting.
567960	568960	It means nothing.
568960	571960	That's dumb.
571960	573960	You can't just string words together.
573960	574960	Robocop.
574960	575960	Fuck you.
575960	576960	Awesome.
576960	577960	Oscar.
577960	579960	Where's the Oscar for Robocop?
579960	583960	Thank you, gentlemen.
583960	585960	And lady.
585960	586960	So, we're at Little Don's.
586960	587960	You left up your sweat.
587960	589960	I left up my shirt, and the guy goes,
589960	592960	so put the playhead back to, I get out of the booth,
592960	594960	and the guy goes, so this is the guy.
594960	598960	And so, I got to tell you where the camera is.
598960	599960	Okay.
599960	601960	You're me.
601960	602960	All of you.
602960	603960	I'll play myself.
603960	605960	You just lifted your shirt.
605960	609960	So, he's talking to his friend who's identical.
609960	612960	They're both like, they're both built like me.
612960	614960	I don't know if it's important to say that.
614960	617960	They both look like they're really good at the pool.
618960	621960	And that's not a compliment.
621960	625960	They look like guys that's like, I don't know what Trevor
625960	627960	and Joey are skilled at, and then you play pool with them
627960	628960	and you're like, oh.
628960	629960	Oh, they're good at pool.
629960	630960	They're good at pool.
630960	631960	Oh, all right.
631960	634960	So, the guys at the bar at this restaurant,
634960	637960	which is two feet from the booth, I stand up.
637960	639960	Someone says, you look like, where's your belly?
639960	640960	Where is it?
640960	641960	I can't find it.
641960	642960	That's a very nice thing to say.
642960	643960	That was me.
643960	645960	Oh, some lady.
646960	648960	The guy said, fucking gross.
648960	650960	He looked at my belly and said, fucking gross.
650960	653960	And you don't blame him.
653960	654960	Who cares?
654960	655960	My theory.
655960	656960	This is a morning show.
656960	658960	There might as well be coffee in this cup.
658960	662960	My theory on that guy is that he was and is homophobic.
662960	664960	So, we saw a man lift up his shirt,
664960	666960	and he didn't want his buddy to think that he liked it.
666960	668960	So, reflexively, he was like, this is gross.
668960	671960	I don't like to take someone who would never suck at it.
672960	674960	That's what happened.
674960	676960	That's a good girlfriend at any rate.
676960	677960	The guy called me gross.
677960	680960	He just wants to fuck you.
680960	682960	That's a good girlfriend.
682960	686960	Well, that's my explanation for anyone who's ever rude to me.
686960	689960	So, stop trying to fuck me so hard.
689960	692960	Mom?
692960	694960	My mom's dead.
696960	698960	Here is not a good girlfriend.
698960	701960	You woke me up at 5.40 this morning.
701960	702960	You weren't awake.
702960	708960	You decided that in your sleep, you were having such a great dream.
708960	714960	But I was awakened at 5.40 a.m. to Erin saying,
714960	717960	Dan, Dan, Dan.
717960	718960	Oh, fuck, shit.
718960	720960	She goes, look, get it.
720960	721960	You got to do it.
721960	722960	Hold up the stick.
722960	723960	Look at the stick.
723960	725960	And she's pointing the corner of the room.
725960	726960	What's the stick?
726960	727960	She gets the microphone.
727960	728960	Hold up the stick.
728960	730960	You have to do it.
730960	731960	And I went, OK.
731960	732960	I'm holding it.
732960	733960	And she went.
736960	739960	And then at 7.40, I'm like, still, two hours later,
739960	743960	I'm like, staring at the ceiling, worried about my finances.
743960	746960	And every once in a while, she's like.
746960	748960	So, like, the stick dream is amazing.
748960	750960	It's got like a comic figure in it.
750960	754960	Like, Charlie Callis comes out later as the stick guardian.
754960	756960	Raise your hand if you know who Charlie Callis is.
757960	761960	There are five people, six people raising their hands.
761960	763960	Most of them are our friends.
764960	766960	Because they've all gotten drunk with Jeff Davis
766960	769960	and he's made you watch Charlie Callis on YouTube for three hours.
769960	773960	Charlie Callis is this incredibly unfunny comic from.
773960	774960	Oh, sweetie.
774960	775960	He's dead.
775960	776960	Oh, he is dead.
776960	781960	He's a dead unfunny comic from the 60s and 70s,
781960	785960	who for no reason just makes nonsense noises
785960	788960	in the middle of explaining stories that no one cares about.
789960	791960	Why don't you give us an example?
791960	793960	Charlie Callis' impression is impeccable.
795960	797960	Can you get a suggestion for an activity
797960	798960	that Charlie Callis might talk about?
798960	799960	Sure, sure.
799960	800960	What's an activity?
800960	801960	Pool.
801960	802960	Pool?
803960	804960	All right.
805960	807960	So, me and my friends, we went to the pool hall
807960	810960	and one of them grabbed a cue off the wall
810960	811960	and I was like.
812960	814960	And then he took the pool,
814960	816960	or took the pool ball and put it on the thing
816960	817960	and I was like.
822960	823960	Wait, wait, wait.
823960	824960	There's a phone call?
824960	825960	Yeah.
825960	826960	Oh, sorry.
826960	827960	It doesn't make sense.
827960	828960	Oh, yeah, yeah.
829960	831960	Hello, this is pool calling.
836960	838960	And then we all went home.
839960	840960	Thank you.
841960	842960	I said thank you for very much.
843960	845960	Yeah, good job applauding that,
845960	847960	because Charlie Callis is dead,
847960	849960	but his wife Rebecca Callis isn't.
849960	850960	I'm sorry, honey.
850960	851960	Come on up here.
852960	853960	My husband is.
853960	855960	She comes up and she's just fucking crying.
855960	858960	And she just blows her brains everywhere.
858960	859960	But as she's blowing her brains,
859960	861960	she says like, I'm going to kill.
861960	862960	I'm going to kill.
862960	864960	I'm going to kill.
864960	865960	I'm going to kill him.
865960	866960	I'm going to kill him.
869960	871960	It'll be so funny when you Google it.
873960	876960	So Aaron and I have a perfect relationship,
876960	877960	which is why.
877960	880960	And I also Aaron has a podcast about relationships
880960	882960	because you remember the name of it.
883960	884960	This feels terrible.
884960	885960	All right.
885960	886960	I just wanted you to say it.
887960	888960	Oh, I'm sorry.
888960	889960	Did someone boo?
889960	893960	Now was there booing your your your awkward approach
893960	894960	to integrated marketing?
894960	895960	Right.
895960	896960	They're not.
896960	897960	They're not doing your podcast.
897960	898960	They're booing.
898960	899960	Like if Calgon came in and said,
899960	902960	that sounds like a clean situation.
903960	904960	Then they go boo.
904960	905960	Thank you.
905960	907960	Thank you for sponsoring Hermitone.
907960	909960	Fuck you for shoehorning it.
909960	910960	Sure.
910960	911960	Should we talk about.
911960	912960	Oh, yeah.
912960	913960	I know.
913960	914960	I'm sorry.
914960	915960	You're saying we have a perfect relationship.
915960	916960	Right. Right.
916960	917960	That's the facade.
917960	920960	This is like Sherman's March or I never saw it.
920960	923960	It's like inception.
923960	926960	You think it's a dream and the perfect relationship
926960	929960	is going to turn out to not be perfect like inception.
929960	932960	Like like the guy eating the soup is going to turn out to fucking
932960	933960	that movie.
934960	935960	Really?
935960	936960	You guys are going to stick to it.
936960	937960	You just love it.
937960	939960	You're just going to die for it.
939960	941960	Like if I come at inception with a buoy knife,
941960	944960	you're going to just fucking like you're going to me,
944960	945960	the creator of community.
948960	950960	That doesn't that doesn't give you pause.
951960	952960	There's no loyalty.
952960	954960	There's no Darth Vader Luke Skywalker moment.
954960	955960	Father, please.
956960	958960	Your emperor is killing me.
959960	963960	You won't pick up inception and dump it into a fucking laser pit for me.
966960	967960	Then your Ewoks.
967960	968960	That's what you are.
968960	970960	You'll sing and dance.
970960	975960	You don't care if your moon of Endor is taken over by the empire.
975960	977960	I got no use for you.
977960	980960	Just don't cook C3PO.
981960	982960	I haven't seen that movie in a while.
982960	984960	I think they were going to cook C3PO.
985960	986960	In soup?
986960	987960	I don't know.
987960	988960	I don't know.
988960	989960	He sat up and they're like, oh, he's a god.
989960	991960	That movie fucking bite a dick too.
993960	994960	Fucking Ewoks.
994960	995960	Everybody does it.
995960	996960	You guys are almost too young.
996960	997960	It's got to the point.
997960	998960	Like when I came out to L.A.
998960	1000960	It was like if I mentioned Star Wars.
1000960	1001960	Oh, my God.
1002960	1003960	Now you're all.
1003960	1004960	And this is what I love about you.
1004960	1005960	You're beyond it.
1005960	1006960	Like racism.
1006960	1007960	You don't give a shit anymore.
1008960	1009960	You're watch.
1009960	1010960	You don't wear watches.
1010960	1011960	You don't have landlines.
1011960	1013960	You don't give a fuck about George Lucas.
1014960	1018960	And the idea that black people can't swim is boring.
1020960	1021960	It's not funny.
1021960	1022960	It's not shocking.
1022960	1023960	It's not.
1023960	1025960	You're like, who cares again with the black people?
1025960	1026960	Fuck you.
1026960	1029960	I'm a quarter Apache and fuck.
1029960	1032960	I got a Chinese guy growing out on the top of my head.
1032960	1034960	I'm half hologram.
1035960	1037960	Even if I'm thoroughbred Eskimo,
1037960	1040960	I still don't give a shit about your dumb racial humor.
1040960	1041960	What are you, Don Rickles?
1041960	1042960	Fuck you.
1044960	1047960	And that's those are the things that I love about you.
1048960	1054960	But you guys should know, since you're so young and so beyond it,
1055960	1058960	that Return of the Jedi movie, those Ewoks were supposed to be Chewbacca's.
1058960	1059960	All right.
1059960	1060960	That's it.
1060960	1061960	That's all I'm going to say about it.
1061960	1062960	Wait, were they really?
1062960	1063960	Can you imagine a planet of Chewbacca's?
1063960	1064960	I know they're called Wookie's.
1064960	1066960	I guess I'll research this on my own time.
1066960	1067960	I didn't realize that before.
1067960	1068960	Yeah.
1068960	1069960	How bad ass would that have been?
1069960	1072960	Oh, you mean originally they were little Chewbacca's.
1072960	1073960	I thought you meant that.
1073960	1074960	They were going to be Wookie's.
1074960	1076960	Someone's muttering something.
1076960	1078960	I've incited a nerd rage.
1078960	1079960	It's valuable.
1079960	1080960	Who's muttering?
1080960	1081960	Who's muttering?
1081960	1082960	Over here.
1082960	1083960	It's okay.
1083960	1084960	What are you saying?
1084960	1085960	It would have been like the holiday special.
1085960	1086960	Oh.
1086960	1089960	You think the Ewoks would have saved the holiday special?
1089960	1091960	You think that would have been...
1091960	1092960	No.
1092960	1093960	I just wanted to get you married.
1093960	1094960	All right.
1094960	1096960	I'll buy you a drink afterwards.
1096960	1098960	He just wants to have sex with you.
1098960	1099960	It's just...
1100960	1101960	Thank you, baby.
1101960	1102960	Thank you.
1104960	1105960	All right.
1105960	1109960	We asked you guys to ask us for relationship advice.
1110960	1111960	Questions.
1111960	1112960	Relationship questions.
1112960	1113960	And here's number...
1113960	1114960	Here's the first one.
1114960	1115960	Here it comes.
1115960	1116960	All right.
1116960	1117960	Here it comes.
1117960	1119960	Along with the sound effect.
1123960	1126960	There's the relationshiposaurus.
1127960	1131960	Descending from the Pleistocene of romance to...
1132960	1134960	Jesus Christ.
1135960	1136960	I'm sorry.
1136960	1137960	No, wait.
1137960	1139960	No, it's time for a question.
1142960	1143960	All right.
1143960	1145960	There's a little bit of overcompensation here.
1145960	1146960	You've probably...
1146960	1148960	Erin's insecure about filling in for Jeff.
1148960	1151960	She brought an iPad sound board.
1151960	1152960	I applaud it.
1152960	1153960	I applaud effort.
1153960	1154960	Thank you.
1155960	1157960	That's why I love inception.
1158960	1160960	Because it tries too hard.
1161960	1165960	If you guys don't like this, then you're hypocrites.
1167960	1169960	I don't want to be the inception of girlfriends.
1169960	1170960	No, don't.
1170960	1172960	No, just the sound board is...
1172960	1173960	It's the...
1173960	1175960	If I was a movie, what movie would I be?
1175960	1176960	Girlfriend-wise.
1176960	1177960	Citizen King.
1179960	1180960	Jesus Christ.
1180960	1181960	Get out.
1181960	1182960	Get out.
1182960	1183960	Get out.
1184960	1186960	Citizen motherfucking king.
1186960	1188960	So with your friends and colleagues, you say you love it,
1188960	1189960	but alone you hate it.
1189960	1192960	No, no, no, no.
1192960	1193960	I got it.
1193960	1194960	No.
1194960	1195960	I didn't really hate it.
1195960	1197960	Some people choose to not understand it,
1197960	1198960	and I say fuck you to them.
1198960	1199960	Over pie.
1202960	1203960	All right.
1203960	1205960	Question number one.
1209960	1210960	It makes no sense.
1211960	1213960	No, you're calling up the information.
1213960	1214960	What?
1216960	1217960	Justification came after...
1217960	1219960	Is the information in 1973?
1219960	1221960	Why am I using a rotary phone?
1223960	1225960	Question number one.
1225960	1227960	What is the significance...
1227960	1228960	God damn it.
1228960	1232960	What is the significance of a man-slash-woman's relationship
1232960	1234960	with their cat?
1235960	1236960	What's the significance...
1236960	1237960	Oh, that's important.
1237960	1239960	Because you have a very close relationship with your cat.
1239960	1240960	Yeah, cats are about...
1240960	1241960	I would kill the music.
1241960	1243960	I don't want to give notes during the show.
1243960	1244960	I'm sorry.
1244960	1245960	I'll stop doing sound effects.
1245960	1246960	Oh, my God.
1246960	1248960	I thought it was going to be a different sound.
1248960	1249960	No, it's fine.
1249960	1250960	It's fine.
1250960	1251960	I want to see where it's going.
1251960	1252960	It's fine.
1253960	1254960	We talked about this.
1254960	1256960	Your job is not to be Jeff Davis,
1256960	1257960	so this is a whole new thing.
1257960	1259960	She's got an iPad full of sound effects.
1259960	1260960	Let's just...
1261960	1262960	Everyone...
1270960	1271960	Guys, it's fine.
1271960	1273960	He's trying to explain something to me.
1275960	1276960	We're fine.
1276960	1278960	It's part of the show.
1279960	1282960	Get off the stage, audience.
1282960	1284960	Stop poking Dan.
1284960	1287960	I've never had to do this with 200 people at the same time,
1287960	1289960	but, guys, she's really cool.
1291960	1294960	I swear to God.
1297960	1298960	That was the last one.
1298960	1301960	Dogs require discipline on behalf of humans.
1301960	1302960	I think that...
1302960	1303960	And I don't want to...
1303960	1306960	You use bad words like arrogance and ego.
1306960	1308960	Confidence would be a better word.
1308960	1310960	You have to have your shit together to have a dog.
1310960	1314960	So if the guy or girl that you're interested in,
1314960	1315960	whoever wrote this question,
1315960	1318960	is a dog person and you're a cat person,
1319960	1321960	then I think what you have to understand is that
1321960	1324960	you might be prone to act like a little baby in the relationship.
1324960	1326960	You have to stay on your shit about that.
1329960	1330960	I think cat people...
1330960	1332960	To own a cat is to say,
1332960	1335960	I don't want responsibility to the animal kingdom.
1335960	1338960	It doesn't mean that you're incapable of taking it on.
1338960	1340960	It's to say, I'm not ready for it yet.
1340960	1341960	I don't want it yet.
1341960	1343960	People that have dogs are going like,
1343960	1344960	you know what?
1344960	1345960	I got my shit together.
1345960	1349960	I want a fucking animal to walk around
1349960	1353960	and I'm going to be the sunshine and rain in its life.
1353960	1355960	If I forget to look at it,
1355960	1357960	it's going to have a heart attack.
1357960	1360960	If I don't tell it a pillow isn't a sandwich,
1360960	1362960	it won't know.
1362960	1364960	I might have to hit it.
1364960	1366960	All kinds of weird shit.
1366960	1367960	Hey, don't.
1367960	1369960	Whoa, whoa.
1369960	1372960	I didn't spend 500,000 years
1372960	1374960	slowly warping the genes of a wolf.
1374960	1377960	Don't come crying to me.
1377960	1379960	I like cats.
1379960	1381960	They're brand new.
1381960	1383960	The Egyptians just invented them,
1383960	1385960	like 1,000 years ago.
1385960	1387960	But I'm happy to make this announcement.
1387960	1390960	Dan is buying a golden doodle.
1390960	1393960	See, thank you for holding your applause
1393960	1395960	until you got verification from me.
1395960	1397960	It may take a little while.
1397960	1400960	We researched the kind of dogs that I might get
1400960	1403960	if I was going to get a dog now that I'm fired.
1403960	1407960	And I guess community was my dog.
1407960	1413960	It has sadly stopped fetching my slippers.
1413960	1416960	And has, in fact, taken to pissing on my face
1416960	1420960	in my sleep.
1420960	1424960	And having panels at Comic Con without me,
1424960	1427960	which it's...
1427960	1428960	Dan, while that was happening,
1428960	1430960	how did you react to that this weekend?
1430960	1432960	I started cleaning my house.
1432960	1434960	For two days, I just started moving boxes around.
1434960	1436960	I was muttering things like,
1436960	1438960	I thought you hated nerds.
1438960	1441960	And then I would find out I made a shelf wrong
1441960	1443960	and I'd kick it across the room.
1443960	1445960	I'd say, I hate my fucking life.
1445960	1448960	I'm a wreck.
1448960	1450960	The show broke up with me.
1450960	1452960	It dumped me.
1452960	1455960	When you dump somebody, don't awe me.
1455960	1457960	I don't mean don't do anything.
1457960	1458960	You can do whatever you want.
1458960	1460960	Don't feel sorry for me.
1460960	1462960	I'm not saying these things to elicit pity.
1462960	1463960	It's a confession.
1463960	1464960	I need to get this off my chest.
1464960	1468960	I feel warped and bad and petty about it.
1468960	1471960	Outside, I smile at people.
1471960	1474960	They drive by and go, toot toot, you got fired.
1474960	1478960	And I go, good morning, Ralph.
1478960	1481960	I guess they wanted to go in a different direction.
1481960	1484960	Just taking out the trash.
1484960	1489960	It's my duty to keep a smile.
1489960	1491960	I'm bummed out.
1491960	1493960	I love my show.
1493960	1495960	What if they took your baby?
1495960	1498960	What if they came in your window and took your baby?
1498960	1501960	You'd probably fix up your house.
1501960	1504960	You'd probably start cleaning your house.
1504960	1505960	Working on your shelving units.
1505960	1507960	And every once in a while, you'd find out that
1507960	1509960	for the third time you had the Home Depot guy
1509960	1512960	cut it a tenth of an inch too long.
1512960	1514960	So it still doesn't fit in the fucking thing.
1514960	1516960	You just erupt into things.
1516960	1517960	Why don't you go to the shelving units?
1517960	1520960	Why don't you fucking fire me then?
1520960	1522960	In fact, I will tell you.
1522960	1524960	I was trying to move my chair.
1524960	1525960	All right.
1525960	1527960	So I was trying to move a reclining chair.
1527960	1529960	Can you just kill the music, though?
1529960	1530960	Oh, I'm so sorry.
1530960	1531960	I can't hear it very well.
1531960	1534960	I mean, I swear to God.
1534960	1537960	Jeff never does this.
1537960	1539960	He just, he, you know, he very-
1539960	1546960	He also never blows you.
1546960	1547960	On the weekends.
1547960	1550960	Do I tell her?
1550960	1552960	We stepped on each other's-
1552960	1553960	Oh, dude.
1553960	1555960	I had a dream.
1555960	1557960	The weird thing about the 540 wake up
1557960	1560960	was I was in the middle of a very intense anxiety dream.
1560960	1564960	But in the dream, Aaron and Jeff and I were on mushrooms.
1564960	1566960	I haven't told Jeff this yet.
1566960	1567960	He's out of town.
1567960	1570960	And in the dream, it was such a vivid dream.
1570960	1571960	And I was in a rage.
1571960	1573960	I'm surprised I wasn't shouting him nicely,
1573960	1575960	because in my dream, I was constantly angry
1575960	1576960	and so stressed out.
1576960	1580960	In my dream, Jeff and my girlfriend and myself
1580960	1583960	were on mushrooms and hanging out and having a good time.
1583960	1589960	And at the end of a big, fun, three-person mushroom trip,
1589960	1591960	Aaron said, guys, you know what?
1591960	1593960	This is going amazing.
1593960	1597960	Let's just do this.
1597960	1598960	Call me crazy.
1598960	1600960	Let's just do it.
1600960	1601960	And I was like, what?
1601960	1602960	Free spirit.
1602960	1604960	And Jeff was like, yeah, I know what she means.
1604960	1607960	Let's fucking do it.
1607960	1610960	We've been thinking about it.
1610960	1612960	Sounds like you've been thinking about it.
1612960	1613960	Well, obviously.
1617960	1619960	It's an anxiety I have.
1619960	1623960	And I'm in the dream going, I only get to play one character.
1623960	1629960	I'm going like, no, I don't want to look at my friend's dick.
1629960	1632960	And I don't want to watch him fuck my girlfriend.
1632960	1636960	And I don't want to high-five him while I do it.
1636960	1637960	Was it an iPhone?
1637960	1639960	I could go on and on for the reasons I don't want to do this,
1639960	1640960	but I'm sorry, guys.
1640960	1643960	But then that's when the dream started,
1643960	1645960	when the nightmare kicked into high gear, because the rest
1645960	1647960	of the dream, it seemed like hours, you know,
1647960	1650960	like an inception, like time slows down.
1650960	1654960	So really, you should rent it.
1654960	1657960	Give it a chance, guys.
1657960	1660960	So I was awoken from that by my girlfriend going,
1660960	1664960	stick with the microphone.
1664960	1666960	Everyone's having a great time but me.
1666960	1669960	I sound like the best.
1669960	1672960	Really quick, when I saw Inception in the theater,
1672960	1674960	I saw it with a couple of friends.
1674960	1676960	You were 12.
1676960	1678960	My mom had to take me off of her breast,
1678960	1681960	and she showed me to the, she held me up to the screen.
1681960	1685960	She held you up and said, one day you'll get this.
1685960	1687960	I saw Inception at the arc light,
1687960	1691960	and the last shot of Inception, it's not really a spoiler,
1691960	1693960	is a shot of a top turning.
1693960	1695960	And you don't know if it's going to fall over,
1695960	1697960	which would mean that he's not in a dream
1697960	1699960	or if it's going to keep on spinning, which means he is
1699960	1701960	in a dream because he finally gets what he wants.
1701960	1705960	The credits started going up, and a woman behind me said,
1705960	1712960	oh, here we go again, as if the movie was about a demented top.
1712960	1716960	And the two were going, here we go again.
1716960	1720960	And that woman walked out going, Inception's great.
1720960	1722960	You know, fuck you guys.
1722960	1725960	You're among dummies.
1725960	1729960	Aaron McGathey text messages, scrolling back to the night.
1734960	1736960	I was trying to move a chair through a doorway that
1736960	1737960	was too narrow for the chair.
1740960	1744960	Welcome to the most entertaining story of your life.
1745960	1747960	Also, there were buttons nearby.
1752960	1754960	The walls were creamed.
1754960	1756960	There was Garrison Keeler in it.
1758960	1760960	How many more people are going to be in this town?
1760960	1764960	Arthur's chair had become an item of much recompense.
1766960	1770960	The cushioning was forgiving.
1771960	1774960	Sean Connery's Garrison Keeler impression is mwah.
1774960	1775960	It is right on.
1775960	1776960	It is right on.
1776960	1777960	It is right on.
1777960	1780960	Most things in Lake Wobegon don't wreck all the bullets.
1784960	1786960	I'd really like to not get sidetracked tonight.
1786960	1787960	OK, I'm sorry.
1787960	1788960	OK.
1788960	1792960	So chair, you're trying to move everyone to a buckle in.
1792960	1794960	He was trying to move a chair.
1794960	1795960	It's a character study.
1795960	1796960	It's funny.
1796960	1798960	I was trying to move a chair through a door.
1799960	1801960	I really think I came out of the gate swinging an Inception,
1801960	1804960	and I think that's the moral of tonight.
1804960	1806960	I really fucked myself.
1806960	1807960	No, you're doing fine.
1807960	1809960	I wish I could take it back, man.
1809960	1811960	I wish I could like that movie.
1811960	1816960	I wish someone could accept into my head the idea
1816960	1823960	that that movie is like RoboCop, because it looks like a lot
1823960	1824960	of skiing to me.
1828960	1830960	Yeah, those dreamscapes weren't very cool.
1830960	1832960	Did you say dreamscape?
1832960	1833960	The original Inception?
1833960	1834960	Thank you, sir.
1834960	1835960	Thank you.
1835960	1836960	Thank you.
1836960	1837960	Thank you.
1837960	1838960	They all came together.
1838960	1840960	The dreamscape club all came together.
1840960	1842960	All of my colleagues in the back, like, yeah,
1842960	1844960	that's what it's like to have a 27-year-old girlfriend,
1844960	1845960	by the way.
1845960	1846960	I'm 39.
1846960	1848960	I'm like, let me show you the real Inception.
1848960	1850960	Dennis Quaid in dreamscape.
1850960	1853960	And then he just shows me his dick.
1853960	1854960	I do that all the time.
1854960	1855960	Ladies.
1859960	1861960	But his dick is a dream within a dream.
1861960	1862960	It's crazy.
1862960	1863960	It's crazy.
1863960	1866960	I look at it, and I see myself naked in science class.
1866960	1869960	And then I see myself skiing.
1869960	1873960	With dicks for poles.
1873960	1876960	With it, we'd be really low to the ground, like crouching.
1876960	1880960	But then the dick looks up and goes, I'm the architect.
1880960	1882960	It's my dream.
1882960	1885960	That's why the balls have different hair on them.
1885960	1888960	And then Ellen Page says, I have no reason to be here.
1888960	1889960	There's no reason for me to be here.
1889960	1890960	That was in Juneau.
1890960	1891960	That's it.
1891960	1893960	And then Joseph Gordon-Levitt says,
1893960	1894960	I thought I was in a better movie than this.
1894960	1896960	I did pretty good in this movie.
1896960	1899960	I'm going to abuse this over validation.
1899960	1904960	And then Leonardo DiCaprio said, I love yachts.
1904960	1906960	Does that cause a Titanic?
1906960	1907960	No, no, no, no.
1907960	1911960	I mean, we can all agree Leonardo DiCaprio is a bad person.
1911960	1912960	I mean, there's probably somebody here.
1912960	1913960	I mean, come on.
1913960	1916960	He's got to be a shitty, terrible person.
1916960	1917960	He's an OK actor.
1917960	1919960	You can see it on his face.
1919960	1920960	He's a bad person.
1920960	1923960	Like when people, when he's at charity events deep down inside,
1923960	1925960	he's like, I don't really care if people don't have cancer.
1925960	1928960	I don't have a yacht.
1928960	1932960	He loves yachts and models.
1932960	1934960	You can't trust people who love yachts.
1934960	1936960	Yachts shouldn't be around.
1936960	1939960	Are you basing?
1939960	1940960	Was he ever on a yacht to your knowledge?
1940960	1942960	Yes, he was on four yachts.
1942960	1943960	Wait, what?
1943960	1946960	At the same time?
1946960	1949960	Every time I've seen a picture of him in a magazine,
1949960	1952960	he's with a different starlet on a yacht.
1952960	1953960	Really? Oh, OK.
1953960	1955960	Yeah, Blake Lively on a yacht.
1955960	1959960	Gazelle Buncheon.
1959960	1961960	You know why I think he's on a yacht, baby?
1961960	1963960	He probably just wants to fuck you.
1963960	1964960	Yeah.
1964960	1965960	I'm a good boyfriend.
1965960	1966960	Probably.
1966960	1967960	All right.
1967960	1969960	There's someone who's not laughing at everything I say in the back.
1969960	1974960	Look, hey, man, how can it happen?
1974960	1975960	I do that too.
1975960	1976960	I do the same thing.
1976960	1979960	A lot of the fights we have are because we're the same person.
1979960	1981960	You're as dishonest and narcissistic as me.
1981960	1985960	And I also play to whoever's not laughing.
1985960	1986960	There's always a guy.
1986960	1987960	There's always a guy.
1987960	1990960	There's a couple of people who are like, grr.
1990960	1995960	I thought you were going to make up a new sitcom for me.
1995960	1996960	I don't know what.
1996960	1998960	And I don't blame you.
1998960	2001960	It's $10, and I'll see you after the show.
2001960	2004960	How about the male and female version of the same person trying to do a show
2004960	2005960	together?
2005960	2008960	One is dressed like his best friend, and he just explained that he wanted to have
2008960	2010960	a three-way with his best friend.
2010960	2011960	How about that?
2011960	2012960	All right.
2012960	2019960	So I was trying to move a chair through a door.
2019960	2024960	And I took off my shirt because I was sweating.
2024960	2028960	And I'm shedding a few, but I still look ridiculous with my shirt off.
2028960	2031960	So she came upstairs, and she saw me standing over this chair that I couldn't
2031960	2032960	get through a doorway.
2032960	2036960	I looked like just a bad, like I was playing this game of Tetris with one
2036960	2038960	piece, like trying to flip it.
2038960	2039960	And she's like coming out.
2039960	2042960	And I was just like drenched in sweat, and I've taken off my shirt.
2042960	2047960	And I look like a community theater version of Stanley Kowalski.
2047960	2050960	And I had tried to move the chair through the door every conceivable way.
2050960	2053960	It's kind of shaped like a whistle, this thing.
2053960	2055960	I get a picture like a whistle.
2055960	2056960	Do they have whistles now?
2056960	2059960	Have those made obsolete by Wi-Fi?
2059960	2061960	Do they still wear on the football field?
2061960	2062960	They're like, no, you use a laser now.
2062960	2064960	You shine it in their eyes.
2064960	2065960	I don't know.
2065960	2066960	I don't follow sports.
2066960	2067960	Maybe the whistle.
2067960	2068960	You don't have the whistle, do you?
2068960	2070960	Kids, there's a whistle.
2070960	2072960	I was trying to figure out.
2072960	2074960	I put the back through the very narrow doorway.
2074960	2075960	It occurred to me.
2075960	2080960	I figured out one angle, and I shared this with Erin because I trust her
2080960	2081960	and love her.
2081960	2082960	Thank you.
2082960	2084960	That's the end of the story.
2084960	2085960	Next question.
2085960	2088960	Why are you so pretty, Erin?
2088960	2089960	Weird.
2089960	2091960	I don't know.
2091960	2096960	This is my spirit, my good spirit.
2096960	2099960	Sorry.
2099960	2103960	She actually does work as a replacement for Jeff Davis.
2103960	2107960	Do you have any stories about the time you ordered milk and the chef said thank you?
2107960	2108960	Thank you.
2108960	2109960	Thank you.
2109960	2110960	All right.
2110960	2112960	No one ever orders milk like that.
2112960	2114960	How did you learn to order milk?
2114960	2115960	I don't know.
2115960	2118960	Were you born milk special?
2118960	2119960	Thank you.
2119960	2120960	I guess I was.
2120960	2121960	I don't know.
2121960	2124960	I don't fucking care.
2124960	2128960	I said I'm going to have to take the door off the hinges in order to get the chair through.
2128960	2129960	It almost makes it through.
2129960	2130960	I got to take the door off the hinges.
2130960	2133960	Erin's immediate response.
2133960	2134960	Don't do that.
2134960	2135960	It's a two-man job.
2135960	2139960	Have you ever taken a door off the hinges before and tried to put it back on?
2139960	2140960	It's a two-man job.
2140960	2142960	It's harder than you think.
2142960	2144960	I go, it's screws in some wood.
2144960	2145960	It's a fucking door.
2145960	2146960	It's a door.
2146960	2150960	No, I've never, to be perfectly honest with you, I've never taken a door off its hinges
2150960	2151960	and then put it back on.
2151960	2154960	Well, it's harder than you think.
2154960	2157960	Well, Erin, I didn't actually ask for your help.
2157960	2163960	And even if I did, I don't think telling someone not to do something is helping them.
2163960	2166960	I find that to be very discouraging, actually.
2166960	2172960	And you definitely said it as sweet and reasonable as you're saying it now.
2172960	2177960	So she goes, well, I'm going to go out drinking again.
2177960	2182960	I'm sorry, we're going to go out fucking again.
2182960	2183960	I'm going to go out fucking again.
2183960	2184960	Oh, no laugh.
2184960	2185960	I'm so sorry.
2185960	2186960	I was kidding.
2186960	2187960	I didn't say that.
2187960	2188960	I was going out to karaoke.
2188960	2189960	I'm so sorry.
2189960	2190960	Don't pollute the story with bits because the truth is funnier than everything.
2190960	2191960	You're right.
2191960	2192960	You're right.
2192960	2193960	You're right.
2193960	2194960	You're right.
2194960	2195960	You're right.
2195960	2196960	You're right.
2196960	2197960	You're right.
2197960	2198960	You're like, oh, fucking, it's a door.
2198960	2199960	So it's like, she's right.
2199960	2207360	It's kind of hard to take off a door by yourself unless you put a fucking thing under the door.
2207360	2208720	It's like cartoon logic.
2208720	2209720	It's like, why is it hard?
2209720	2214440	Oh, because the door, if you take a screw, the screw, it'll start to fall off the hinges.
2214440	2215440	Oh, no.
2215440	2217000	What am I going to do?
2217000	2218000	What am I?
2218000	2219000	What am I a fucking Fox?
2219000	2220000	Am I a beaver?
2220000	2221120	No, I'm a primate.
2221120	2225200	I think I'll go get a thing that says hi as the door comes off the ground, put it under
2225200	2228600	the door so that when it comes off the hinges, it's resting on that.
2228600	2235520	And I took it off as fucking hinges and I put the chair through the door and I put the
2235520	2240960	door back on the hinges and I sent my drinking girlfriend two photos.
2240960	2245320	One of the chair in the room that it was too small, it was too big to get into, the other
2245320	2252960	of the newly intact door, re hinged and ready for closing or opening.
2252960	2257400	And I said, no, no, so you'll be me and I'll be you.
2257400	2258400	All right.
2258400	2260400	So you'll be me, I'll be you.
2260400	2272440	It was probably a two man job, but you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.
2272440	2277280	And no idea that Tim Allen had cloned himself and there were 50 Tim Allens in the...
2277280	2278280	Well, you...
2278280	2282080	All right, let's just read it and then we'll talk about it, Aaron.
2282080	2293680	It probably was a two man job, but you probably forgot I have the power of 10 men.
2293680	2296680	That's awesome.
2296680	2299280	I'm legitimately impressed.
2299280	2300400	I don't want you to be impressed.
2300400	2304560	I want you to be supportive of me in the face of adversity.
2304560	2314720	Or, or I guess you could fire me and tell everyone that I did it inofficially.
2314720	2329160	Jesus, I'm sorry, Peter to the punctuation, Jesus, period, I'm sorry, period.
2329160	2330560	I love you, period.
2330560	2331560	All right.
2331560	2335160	You really did it, period.
2335160	2337160	Pause.
2337160	2340040	Sorry, I was trying to save you heartache.
2340040	2347120	Lesson learned, no punctuation.
2347120	2348560	To no reach on for a while.
2348560	2351000	20 minutes later.
2351000	2353120	Are you mad at me?
2353120	2355120	No.
2355120	2357560	Okay.
2357560	2361840	It's not that crowded here if you want to drink, exclamation point.
2361840	2364720	Just me and Kimber.
2364720	2366720	No thanks.
2366720	2369840	Very tired.
2369840	2371680	Okay, period.
2371680	2374640	You sure you're not upset, question mark?
2374640	2378520	I don't have enough energy to be upset, but I can't take away the same shame you feel
2378520	2381880	for not believing in my door powers.
2381880	2389840	That is, that is shame you are putting on yourself.
2389840	2400600	Hah, dash, dash, okay, true.
2400600	2403960	Is it okay if Kimber stays in your guest room?
2403960	2404960	That's fine.
2404960	2405960	Thank you.
2405960	2406960	This is this morning.
2406960	2407960	Yeah, this is morning.
2407960	2408960	Unimportant.
2409080	2410080	He left.
2410080	2417440	I woke up to an empty bed, so I texted him.
2417440	2422400	You can play Minecraft in here, smile face.
2422400	2428560	Oh, does nobody need to hold up the stick anymore?
2428560	2430960	Because that's why I was downstairs.
2430960	2435360	I'm fucking 5'40 in the morning, hold up the stick, I'm a fucking three way loving dream
2435360	2436360	bitch.
2437360	2444200	I'm going to go play a video game where my efforts are rewarded in a linear fashion.
2444200	2452000	That's the name of my 70s metal band, three way loving dream bitch.
2452000	2457120	She's a three way loving dream bitch.
2457120	2458120	She likes.
2458120	2463360	Abercrombie and fish chagata.
2463360	2466480	Speaking of which, I'm wearing this sweater to honor the fact that the air conditioning
2466480	2467480	is working in this room.
2467480	2468480	I'm sure you guys are.
2468480	2472320	They used to get sweltering hot in here.
2472320	2477280	The fact that I can wear a sweater up here is amazing, and we owe that to, I believe
2477280	2481480	we owe that to, well, we owe that to everybody at Meltdown Comics.
2481480	2483280	They don't have to, this place is always packed.
2483280	2485320	They could tell you to go fuck yourselves as a customer.
2485320	2490480	They have your money, they have your devotion, but they choose to adjust the climate at the
2490480	2492920	expense of thousands of dollars to them.
2492920	2495680	They want you to be happy as well as lucrative.
2495680	2500680	And the good people at True Value, yes.
2500680	2502040	True Value.
2502040	2507040	Did someone say True Value?
2507040	2510680	We make hardware stores, not slogans.
2510680	2511680	True Value.
2511680	2515040	All right.
2515040	2516040	And butter.
2516040	2517040	I have some more.
2517040	2519040	It's bigger than milk.
2519040	2524240	And twice as yellow.
2524240	2526640	Better than pee since 1940.
2526640	2527640	Butter.
2527640	2532440	Just do the, do the, break it up.
2532440	2535920	There's people in the back who's like, the charisma zone is here.
2535920	2536920	These people get splashed.
2536920	2538760	It's like a SeaWorld show.
2538760	2541320	They feel the brine and the shrimp on their faces.
2541320	2542920	They're like, I fucking love whales.
2542920	2545640	Like, can I get, can I get a whale hat on my way out?
2545640	2546640	I love whales.
2546640	2547640	No, it's not.
2547640	2548640	They're halfway the drive home.
2549240	2550240	What was that?
2550240	2551240	A bunch of whales.
2551240	2553840	The people, as you go further back, there's people in the back that are like, what the
2553840	2554840	fuck's going on?
2554840	2560360	There's this guy just talking to his girlfriend about fucking, whether his ass is fat and
2560360	2561360	fuck these people.
2561360	2562360	I don't know.
2562360	2565560	I'd fire him too.
2565560	2569280	You don't have to keep, I guess I do that to get that reaction.
2569280	2575160	I also probably did some stuff to get fired.
2575160	2576160	I'm sure I did.
2576600	2580400	I never, ever, ever did anything they wanted me to do.
2580400	2584360	They always were going, hey, you should have Martin Short on the show.
2584360	2588880	You didn't get to be like the three amigos with Chevy Chase.
2588880	2589880	Okay.
2589880	2592880	I'm on it.
2592880	2593880	Shit.
2593880	2598400	So how's the video game episode coming?
2598400	2599400	They didn't like me.
2599400	2600760	I didn't listen to them.
2600760	2602720	I'm not a hero for doing that.
2602720	2604280	That's childish.
2604280	2607320	If you ever have a television show, you should clean your plate.
2607320	2608320	Do your show.
2608320	2610680	Do it the way that they want you to do it.
2610680	2615280	Otherwise you won't get to make a television show anymore.
2615280	2620480	You'll just be hanging out.
2620480	2625720	If you like television so much, do it right.
2625720	2628320	All right.
2628320	2631560	But my relationship is perfect.
2631560	2633240	I'm not here to give TV show advice.
2633320	2634480	Are you raising your hand, sir?
2634480	2635480	Well, this is important.
2635480	2636480	Well, you just reminded me.
2636480	2644480	I had heard at one point the video game episode was the, was that ever the case?
2644480	2645480	Wait, what?
2645480	2646480	The video game episode was what?
2646480	2650000	Was the video game ever the finale of last season?
2650000	2652360	No, no, no, no, no.
2652360	2656000	He asked, was the video game episode ever the finale?
2656000	2662920	Big fans are like the production codes of the episodes like the numbers 320, 321, 322.
2662920	2664940	Sometimes we shuffle episodes and those are a tip off.
2664940	2667520	We do do that.
2667520	2671800	Because we do make, and it is a disservice to the continuity of the show.
2671800	2674600	Sometimes we go like, well, 313 is a happier episode.
2674600	2676160	We're coming back from a break or whatever.
2676160	2677880	We're like, shuffle it a little bit.
2677880	2681480	And I always tell people when we do that, and then on the DVD, well, I don't have no
2681480	2685000	control over it now, but they're supposed to correct that on the DVD.
2685000	2688600	In the cases of things like that, the production codes of the episodes like with the Christmas
2688600	2692800	episode that was stop animated and that video game episode, we tend to just give it the
2692800	2699560	latest production code number because why I'm not necessarily sure it has something
2699560	2703520	to do with just giving it, because it's like, that's a post productive intensive episode.
2703520	2704520	We're going to get to that.
2704520	2706800	That'll be the last one that we finish producing.
2706800	2709360	Let's just call it 322, for instance.
2709360	2717000	And then the other one, I would never do a finale with just them playing video games.
2717000	2721000	I would do it with a guy going in a cardboard box and turning into a flash of light.
2722000	2723000	Because I'm a genius.
2725000	2733240	Anyway, so very odd of you to just blurt out that question, but there was no problem with
2733240	2734240	it.
2734240	2735240	That's fine.
2735240	2738960	It didn't turn into a rape or anything.
2738960	2742560	It's alarming to people when someone does that because it's possible then that you could
2742560	2746560	just start raping people and no one would be able to do anything about it.
2746560	2750960	So the whole feeling of social order kind of collapses.
2750960	2751960	There's 200 people.
2751960	2754040	If you all just charged me, you could kill me.
2754040	2758720	If you all just started talking or eating peanuts, even if you all ate peanuts in unison,
2758720	2761520	that would be like a form of absolutely would overpower me.
2761520	2763520	And I would, I would, I would, you wouldn't be able to hear me.
2763520	2765200	Also, you have all the power.
2765200	2771400	So like with apartheid, like I need you to not know that I need to delay that realization
2771400	2774440	that you guys are in charge.
2774440	2777960	What were we talking about?
2777960	2778960	We're going on to our next question.
2778960	2779960	Oh, right.
2779960	2780960	Right.
2780960	2781960	Right.
2781960	2782960	Yeah.
2782960	2783960	Next question.
2783960	2784960	Dan, do you believe in love at first night?
2784960	2785960	First night.
2785960	2786960	I'm sorry.
2786960	2796680	Freudian slip at first sight discuss.
2796680	2801280	I'm going to say, well, I'm going to say no, because like the definition of love is I believe
2801280	2808120	that people who end up like happy together forever, you can trickle back and find out
2808120	2812520	that they, when they saw each other, they were into each other, like at an intense level
2812520	2814480	unshared by any previous relationship.
2814480	2821000	But that, that might be coincidence because I think that love is true love is you.
2821000	2823800	Number one, you, you die for the other person.
2823800	2826880	That's a hard one to, that's a tough order to fill.
2826880	2830760	Well, there might even be like degrees of love.
2831400	2834400	A Roman numeral three.
2834400	2841240	But, but, but also like you have to be, well, when you love somebody, you have to be willing
2841240	2844800	to endure their bullshit.
2844800	2850560	That high fidelity monologue about, you know, you're not allowed to compare the women that
2850560	2854800	you see on the street to the ratty panties that are hanging over your shower curtain.
2854800	2859160	I'm paraphrasing a better writer than me.
2859160	2866240	But you, that monologue, I'm making a curtain, it's the person that you're with every day.
2866240	2869720	As you say, when you eventually marry them, it's the for better or for worse thing, you're
2869720	2873920	taking a vow, not because you want to like what it turns into in Western societies, we
2873920	2877400	just like hold hands and go like, all right, no, but promise for real, except unless we
2877400	2878400	get a divorce.
2878400	2879400	Okay, go.
2879400	2886360	It's really supposed to be like, no, because you're going to be shitty sometimes, like I'm,
2886360	2889920	I'm not going to, you know, I'm going to average things out now.
2889920	2893240	I'm not going to base it on whether or not every date goes perfectly.
2893240	2895360	We're not even going to date anymore.
2895360	2897920	We're going to have breakfast together and it's like, you're going to be in a bad mood.
2897920	2902520	I'm going to be in a bad mood and you know, I'm going to want to hit you with an iron.
2902520	2903520	Jesus.
2903520	2905520	We'll talk later.
2905520	2909120	I wish you would iron more.
2909120	2914040	I hate that I have to do all the ironing and that you stand there and watch me with your
2914040	2919520	head in a head holder and I just, I love my head holder.
2919520	2921480	It's perfect for nothing.
2921480	2922480	It's perfect for nothing.
2922480	2923480	It doesn't exist.
2923480	2925520	Can you draw out the reading of the next question so I can get a drink?
2925520	2930520	Yeah, I'm holding, I'm covered in questions.
2930520	2931520	Here we go.
2931520	2932520	Let's see.
2932520	2933520	Bagathi.
2933520	2934520	Can you make this work?
2934520	2935520	Here it goes.
2935520	2937520	It's coming out and there it is.
2938520	2939520	All right.
2944520	2947520	Not such a bad girlfriend.
2952520	2955520	She has her moments.
2955520	2961520	Uh, like the lamb allergy lie, which we'll get to in just a moment.
2961520	2963520	I don't think it's going to be very fun.
2964520	2968520	I feel like it has to be, I don't think it's going to be a long story.
2968520	2969520	No.
2970520	2975520	Once upon a time, Erin pretended to have a lamb allergy just to get her way.
2975520	2977520	The end.
2979520	2982520	They lived happily ever after.
2982520	2983520	Question mark?
2986520	2988520	Next question.
2988520	2989520	What's the question?
2989520	2992520	I'm going to react to you saying question mark.
2992520	2995520	We have a very happy relationship, you fucking asshole.
2995520	3000520	I just try to make the nice people happy.
3000520	3002520	Go back to your ex-girlfriends.
3002520	3004520	You guys had a lot of fun.
3007520	3008520	It's fine.
3008520	3009520	I'm sure no one will have me.
3012520	3014520	It's like dating myself.
3014520	3019520	It's the fucking worst and the best.
3019520	3020520	It's so arrogant.
3020520	3022520	I'm not going to defend our relationship.
3022520	3023520	It's passionate.
3023520	3024520	Again?
3024520	3028520	There are crimes of passion where someone cuts someone's head off with a chainsaw.
3028520	3030520	There's a crime of passion.
3030520	3032520	I'm passionately in love with you.
3032520	3036520	I may decapitate you at some point.
3036520	3040520	I mean, Dan, I want to say in front of everybody, Dan, you're my best friend.
3043520	3044520	I love Tron.
3044520	3054520	And I love attention from strangers, gentlemen.
3054520	3055520	Don't do that.
3055520	3057520	Don't put your shingle out because it hurt my town.
3057520	3061520	This is apropos of this line of conversation.
3061520	3063520	I've been with my boyfriend for eight years.
3063520	3065520	I love him, but we fight all the time.
3065520	3067520	What should I do?
3067520	3068520	Wait, is that for real?
3068520	3070520	Oh, OK.
3070520	3073520	Mariam.
3073520	3075520	You've been with him for eight years.
3075520	3079520	If you're asking that question, you're looking for someone to fire a gun
3079520	3082520	at the starting line that's you getting out of a relationship.
3082520	3084520	You don't ask that question if you...
3084520	3087520	Not necessarily, because if you fight all the time...
3087520	3090520	But why would you ask that question if you weren't happy?
3090520	3094520	Because other people are constantly going, you know, you guys fight all the time.
3094520	3099520	If you and I were on a desert island, I wouldn't know that I fought with you all the time.
3099520	3100520	Right.
3100520	3104520	I'm just interacting with you the way a mommy does a daddy.
3104520	3107520	The way I understand it.
3107520	3112520	And then my sane friends go, Jesus Christ, you guys hate each other.
3112520	3118520	Like, does the person that wrote that down want to retain their anonymity
3118520	3121520	or can you answer a couple questions by shouting out?
3121520	3122520	Just simple...
3122520	3126520	There are 20 guys in the audience that are about to throw up.
3126520	3128520	OK.
3129520	3130520	If you want to come up, come up.
3130520	3131520	If you're OK with that.
3131520	3132520	Come on down.
3132520	3136520	This would be a good time for a sound cue.
3136520	3137520	Here it comes.
3137520	3139520	Here's the sound cue.
3139520	3140520	Here it...
3140520	3141520	Sorry.
3141520	3143520	You can take the...
3143520	3147520	I'm sorry, first of all, I'm sorry about my girlfriend and her sound effects.
3147520	3151520	Welcome to the bottom of the sea where...
3151520	3155520	Or the inside of a uterus, whatever that sound effect was.
3155520	3156520	It's comfortable.
3156520	3157520	It's cozy.
3157520	3159520	Your name is ma'am.
3159520	3160520	My name's Tiffany.
3160520	3161520	Tiffany.
3161520	3163520	You gotta call her a miss, brah.
3163520	3165520	I don't know that code.
3165520	3167520	I don't know...
3167520	3171520	Always, gentlemen, always call young women miss.
3171520	3172520	All right.
3172520	3174520	So when you get called ma'am, it's a bummer, right?
3174520	3176520	No, go ahead, call me ma'am.
3176520	3178520	All right, thanks for selling me out.
3178520	3180520	Sisterhood.
3180520	3182520	I'm wearing a suit, but I'm a woman.
3182520	3184520	Back me up, ma'am.
3184520	3186520	I don't know.
3186520	3187520	All right.
3187520	3188520	So I'm sorry.
3188520	3191520	What's your name, young little tater tot?
3191520	3192520	My name's Tiffany.
3192520	3193520	Tiffany, right.
3193520	3194520	You already said that.
3194520	3195520	Okay, got it.
3195520	3196520	All right.
3196520	3197520	Nomadic advice.
3197520	3198520	Tiffany gave...
3198520	3199520	Epiphany.
3199520	3201520	Her name was Tiffany.
3201520	3203520	All right, Tiffany.
3203520	3205520	So is he here?
3205520	3206520	Yeah, he's back there.
3206520	3207520	Oh, Jesus.
3207520	3208520	Well, that's...
3208520	3212520	He was very mad that I wrote that question, actually.
3212520	3215520	We had a little fight on it.
3215520	3216520	I thought it.
3216520	3217520	Being mad.
3217520	3218520	Yeah, of course.
3218520	3219520	You guys...
3219520	3222520	Yeah, well, that's what Erin and I fight about fighting.
3222520	3224520	Tiffany, you're 26.
3224520	3228520	No, I was listening to what you were saying, and it felt exactly...
3228520	3231520	Like when she said, you can play Minecraft in here.
3231520	3235520	I think I've texted that to him before.
3235520	3236520	Okay.
3236520	3240520	Did you ever read that men are from Mars, women are from Venus thing?
3240520	3241520	No.
3241520	3244520	I didn't either, but I listened to the book on tape.
3245520	3246520	See?
3246520	3251520	Because I was taking a road trip, and the guy said that women are like waves.
3251520	3255520	They rise and fall, and men are like rubber bands.
3255520	3258520	They back away, and then they snap forward.
3258520	3261520	Also, they're everywhere, and you can always find a new one.
3267520	3269520	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
3269520	3270520	I love you.
3270520	3271520	I love you so much.
3271520	3272520	I'm so sorry.
3272520	3273520	I'm so happy as a podcast producer.
3273520	3274520	It's like, oh, there's an edit point.
3274520	3276520	We can pretend the show ended there.
3278520	3279520	I'm in the middle of an interview.
3279520	3281520	Tiffany, how old were you when you...
3281520	3284520	How old were you guys when you first started dating?
3284520	3286520	We were 16 and now we're 24.
3286520	3287520	Whoa.
3287520	3289520	How old were you guys when you moved in together?
3291520	3293520	In 19, 19.
3293520	3294520	Okay.
3294520	3295520	In 19, 19.
3295520	3296520	No, I got it.
3296520	3297520	I'm sorry.
3297520	3298520	That was me being...
3298520	3299520	I was trying to think of it.
3299520	3300520	No, you got it.
3300520	3301520	You were 18 years old.
3301520	3302520	You were great.
3302520	3304520	I would like to be your friend.
3307520	3312520	I would say no matter what happens, we all change so much from 16 to 24.
3312520	3314520	We turn into different people.
3314520	3315520	We become different people.
3315520	3319520	So no matter what happened, there are no heroes or villains.
3319520	3321520	As Dan told me once, there's no good or bad in love.
3321520	3323520	There's just honest and dishonest.
3323520	3325520	So let's get him up here.
3327520	3328520	Should we do that?
3328520	3329520	He doesn't want to come up here.
3329520	3330520	I'm so sorry.
3330520	3331520	Is he willing to come up or is he...
3331520	3332520	No, don't make him.
3332520	3333520	Okay.
3333520	3334520	Don't make him.
3334520	3335520	No, okay.
3337520	3339520	I mean, come up if you want to come up.
3339520	3343520	Don't have me telling you to do things I don't care about.
3345520	3346520	Men are like...
3346520	3348520	Can we get invites to your imaginary wedding?
3348520	3349520	Rubber bands.
3349520	3356520	Men pull back when they feel like there's a risk of them being emasculated or confined,
3356520	3357520	constricted.
3357520	3360520	Men have this tendency, according to this book...
3360520	3361520	I'll trust this guy.
3361520	3363520	He sounds like he's eating a ton of pussy.
3364520	3366520	Have you ever heard his voice on tape?
3367520	3370520	He just sounds the most masculine guy in the world.
3373520	3375520	But he says something that kind of resonated with me.
3375520	3377520	It's like, women go up and down.
3377520	3382520	What's the most frequent ending to every argument that men and women have?
3383520	3385520	I didn't want...
3385520	3386520	With a woman saying,
3386520	3388520	I didn't want you to do anything about it.
3388520	3392520	I just wanted you to support me.
3392520	3393520	And the man going,
3393520	3395520	I don't understand what the fuck you're talking about.
3395520	3397520	Wasn't that you with the door to her?
3397520	3398520	Yeah, well...
3401520	3402520	All right.
3402520	3404520	Back on team women.
3405520	3408520	We welcome you back on behalf of all the ladies.
3409520	3410520	I told her.
3410520	3411520	I told her.
3411520	3412520	You've been together eight years.
3412520	3414520	That's before the 16 thing.
3414520	3416520	You adjust for inflation there.
3416520	3419520	Sixteen to 20 doesn't count.
3419520	3422520	But that doesn't mean that your relationship doesn't count.
3422520	3424520	That's still a four-year relationship.
3424520	3426520	I'm not good at math.
3427520	3429520	I have never gone more than three years.
3429520	3431520	And at the end of three years...
3431520	3434520	A relationship to last a certain length.
3434520	3436520	I'm a behaviorist.
3436520	3439520	I think that if people are together,
3439520	3441520	then it says that they want to be together.
3441520	3443520	And if in that relationship they're fighting,
3443520	3447520	then it says that both of them are committing to this opera
3447520	3450520	where you fight and that's a definition of a relationship.
3450520	3453520	And if he's going,
3453520	3456520	I'm going to go down to my boxers and disappear
3456520	3458520	and hide in a closet and play on my laptop
3458520	3459520	and do God knows what,
3459520	3460520	and you're going,
3460520	3462520	I don't just want you to...
3462520	3466520	I say take your hands off the wheel
3466520	3468520	and if the car goes in the ditch, you're not going to die
3468520	3470520	because it's not a car, it's a relationship.
3470520	3472520	I would say...
3472520	3474520	That's my advice to everyone here
3474520	3476520	for every problem that you have.
3476520	3477520	I guess we could...
3477520	3479520	I would say no matter what,
3479520	3482520	and I hope this isn't a catalyst for a big conversation you have.
3482520	3484520	You're going to have a huge fight.
3484520	3485520	I know, I know.
3485520	3489520	But I just want to say that we are culture values,
3489520	3491520	love and commitment so much,
3491520	3493520	and that's important, but no matter what happens,
3493520	3496520	that means something that you guys were together for so long
3496520	3499520	that's meaningful, and I had early relationships
3499520	3503520	that with non-geniuses...
3507520	3510520	Those relationships that you have are important,
3510520	3512520	and if something was to happen
3512520	3515520	and you guys were to go on different paths,
3515520	3517520	it doesn't negate what you had already
3517520	3519520	and you could still love each other,
3519520	3521520	even if you want different things.
3521520	3523520	I mean, you may call him from time to time
3523520	3524520	and just ask him if he wants to...
3524520	3526520	She's trying to break up with him.
3526520	3528520	Right in front of him.
3528520	3530520	This is why women drive me nuts!
3530520	3532520	We're done!
3532520	3535520	What, I'm siding with a guy because he's a guy?
3535520	3536520	I hate myself.
3536520	3537520	No, it's fine.
3537520	3539520	There's no side.
3539520	3542520	Tiffany, I will say you are in for a world of shit
3542520	3544520	when you get back to your seat.
3544520	3546520	Yeah, yeah, I think so.
3546520	3550520	Well, thanks Tiffany for ruining our relationship for us.
3550520	3552520	For our paltry.
3554520	3556520	Ooh, this is a good question.
3556520	3558520	We didn't commit any crimes just now
3558520	3561520	that numerous reality shows don't commit.
3561520	3563520	There was that reality show that basically murdered
3563520	3565520	Corey Haim just for...
3565520	3567520	No, I don't think so.
3567520	3569520	Hilarious of you, we're on drugs in the house.
3569520	3570520	Want more drugs?
3570520	3571520	And then he's dead and they're like,
3571520	3573520	well, I guess that show's canceled.
3573520	3576520	No, I don't want anyone to break up.
3576520	3580520	I want people to not feel guilty for their paths changing
3580520	3583520	or to not value their previous relationships.
3583520	3586520	Her question wasn't, and I don't want to fight with you,
3586520	3588520	but again.
3588520	3590520	But her question wasn't,
3590520	3592520	what do I do about the fact that our past changed?
3592520	3594520	But there's a reason why you ask a question.
3594520	3596520	Like if I put in like...
3596520	3599520	I fucking hate you so much.
3599520	3603520	I just will have it out in the car.
3603520	3606520	Wow, I turned into...
3606520	3607520	Yeah, yeah.
3607520	3608520	Let's try it.
3608520	3609520	Let's see what happens.
3609520	3610520	Yeah, yeah.
3610520	3613520	Dan Harmon, relationship expert.
3613520	3616520	How do I get out of the friend zone?
3616520	3618520	How do I...
3618520	3620520	How do you get out of the friend zone?
3620520	3623520	I run it into the ground, fucking like tell her,
3623520	3628520	I'm assuming this is a dude.
3628520	3633520	There is such a thing as a girl that ends up in the friend zone, but...
3633520	3636520	There's wispy mustache sweat on this.
3636520	3638520	So I believe it is.
3638520	3639520	I believe it is a dude.
3639520	3641520	There is a...
3641520	3645520	Every once in a while a canvas wants to know how to treat a paintbrush,
3645520	3649520	but meh, it's probably a guy asking how to get out of the friend zone.
3649520	3650520	It happens.
3650520	3658520	Sometimes you paint by going like this with an easel.
3658520	3660520	We were in the friend zone.
3660520	3663520	You already know the answer to that question.
3663520	3673520	You tell her how you feel because she will run like you're a fucking atom bomb.
3673520	3676520	And be honest with yourself about whether you can stand hanging out with her
3676520	3678520	when sex is off the table.
3678520	3682520	The friend zone thing is like a sticking point with me
3682520	3685520	because I had that issue with you.
3685520	3686520	That's what you said.
3686520	3687520	You and I were the...
3687520	3691520	Yeah, fucking, I wanted to die.
3691520	3694520	I've thinly tolerated it, but I said to you,
3694520	3699520	I demanded to know what this really meant, this platonic relationship.
3699520	3701520	Did it mean that you had other irons in the fire?
3701520	3702520	Is that what that means?
3702520	3703520	Does you mean...
3703520	3707520	The idea that you not being ready for a relationship,
3707520	3713520	does that mean that you're not ready for a relationship
3713520	3715520	with like seven dudes at the same time?
3715520	3718520	Or does that mean that you really like me?
3718520	3723520	That's not really the point because how she responds is up to her.
3723520	3724520	But there were reasons, right?
3724520	3727520	It wasn't a normal shitty girl situation.
3727520	3728520	There were reasons behind it.
3728520	3732520	The thing that a guy has to do to protect himself from that
3732520	3735520	is to always just like, as uncharismatic,
3735520	3740520	we're encouraged as guys, we go, women always call us liars.
3740520	3744520	They always go like, oh, guys are pigs, you're liars and all this stuff.
3744520	3749520	Guys are, we are pigs, dogs, whatever animal metaphor you want to use,
3749520	3750520	but we're simple.
3750520	3754520	We are capable of just being honest and blunt about what it is we want
3754520	3756520	and we kind of like get trained over time,
3756520	3759520	probably justifiably, to have a little bit of...
3759520	3764520	...grace about it.
3764520	3770520	But that can slide into lying and deceiving and like playing some weird game.
3770520	3775520	And then on the other side, there are honest women who are cool with that
3775520	3778520	and will say to guys, like, I think you might...
3778520	3780520	You say you want to be platonic friends,
3780520	3783520	but I feel like this is more than that.
3783520	3786520	I just want to make sure you understand, right?
3786520	3787520	Okay, communication works.
3787520	3791520	But then there are as many dishonest women as there are dishonest men.
3791520	3794520	And so what happens is there's a guy on one side going like,
3794520	3796520	I'm in it for the long con.
3796520	3798520	I'm going to sneak in the back door.
3798520	3802520	She's with Richard right now, but I'm there when she cries.
3802520	3805520	I got her umbrella.
3805520	3807520	I love umbrellas.
3807520	3810520	To put under her eyes for her cheeks?
3810520	3813520	Something like that.
3813520	3815520	Who's this talking to me?
3815520	3816520	Is it God?
3816520	3818520	This is God, Jerry.
3818520	3819520	Oh, God.
3819520	3821520	Keep it down, will you?
3821520	3823520	Jerry, I want to talk to you.
3823520	3825520	I'm just talking to myself, the audience.
3825520	3828520	A Shakespearean character, kind of sometimes they talk outward
3828520	3830520	to share their thoughts and feelings.
3830520	3834520	It's not necessarily an invitation to a fucking full dialogue.
3834520	3836520	I'm just a guy trying to get laid.
3836520	3840520	Jerry, first of all, I love your burlap pants.
3840520	3844520	Second of all, you know, sometimes, you know,
3844520	3848520	everybody, women and men, go through different stages of insecurity.
3848520	3851520	Oh, God.
3851520	3859520	How'd you make such an exciting world?
3859520	3862520	Are you the same God that invented flamingos?
3862520	3863520	Yeah.
3863520	3865520	You're just dragging me down.
3865520	3866520	Oh, yeah, that was me.
3866520	3867520	I was in a good mood.
3867520	3869520	I created the flamingo and the platypus.
3869520	3873520	What can I do to get you back in that mood?
3873520	3878520	Looking for more of a flamingo God, less of a Judd Hirsch from Taxi God.
3878520	3880520	Jerry, I talked to very few people.
3880520	3884520	You're wasting your God time.
3884520	3885520	Point taken.
3885520	3888520	Finish up.
3888520	3892520	Jerry, women and men, when they're first starting state,
3892520	3893520	are sometimes insecure.
3893520	3897520	So I think that sometimes nice guys, when they're younger,
3897520	3899520	when they're teenagers and are in their early 20s
3899520	3900520	and they approach women, they're like,
3900520	3902520	I just want to be friends.
3902520	3905520	It's hard when you're insecure to accept that somebody likes you.
3905520	3911520	So that when women get older, that insecurity thing kind of changes a little bit.
3911520	3916520	So with that friend thing, maybe it's more about her than it is about you,
3916520	3921520	and you should probably go bark up a different tree or become a rock star.
3921520	3922520	All right.
3922520	3925520	Are you saying, take your God mask off, Erin.
3925520	3927520	It was me the whole time.
3927520	3929520	It was me, Dan, the whole time.
3929520	3931520	What the fuck are you talking about?
3931520	3932520	No, no.
3932520	3935520	You're saying that there's situations where men are...
3935520	3938520	I guess that this friend zone person, if you're comfortable,
3938520	3943520	if you could just scream out your age really quick.
3943520	3945520	Oh, the guy who...
3945520	3950520	He's sitting with the chick that he's in the friend zone with.
3950520	3951520	She thinks that he's awesome.
3951520	3954520	And he's like, thank you so much for giving me a ride to Alex's house.
3954520	3955520	I appreciate it.
3955520	3957520	He's three years into a nine-year jackpot.
3957520	3959520	I'm just saying, I was...
3959520	3961520	He's not going to fuck it up for us.
3961520	3964520	He's not like Tiffany and Zorro, whoever she comes in.
3964520	3968520	I'm speaking Zorro.
3968520	3969520	Well, I assume he's Zorro.
3969520	3972520	He fucking gets away with murder with her.
3972520	3973520	We don't mean it.
3973520	3975520	The friend zone, don't get in it.
3975520	3976520	That's the only advice we can give.
3976520	3978520	It's like saying, how do I get out of quicksand?
3978520	3979520	You can't. You're dead.
3979520	3981520	I just want to say it's more...
3981520	3983520	Don't ever, when you see it, step around it.
3983520	3986520	I would say across the board.
3986520	3988520	And I think, ladies, you'll agree with me.
3988520	3991520	If your intentions are romantic, fucking own that.
3991520	3994520	Don't be like, hey, like, yeah, this isn't a date.
3994520	3997520	I mean, if I can just drive you to coffee or whatever,
3997520	3999520	and then all of a sudden say, like,
3999520	4001520	I'm going to look at your pussy.
4001520	4003520	Like, that's the worst.
4003520	4005520	That's dishonest.
4005520	4009520	If you, my friends, are like, shaking their heads.
4009520	4010520	So don't do that.
4010520	4013520	Well, I'm just saying, like, if you're interested in somebody,
4013520	4017520	first look Jerry in the mirror and say,
4017520	4020520	Jerry, you're cool because you're smart.
4020520	4022520	You made these burlap pants.
4022520	4024520	No one wears burlap pants.
4024520	4027520	And then when you see a girl that you like, go up to her,
4027520	4029520	hey, hey, what's your name?
4029520	4032520	My name is Angela.
4032520	4034520	Hey, Angela, I think you're real beautiful.
4034520	4037520	If I could buy you a drink sometime, I would love that.
4037520	4038520	Thank you.
4038520	4039520	Don't do...
4039520	4041520	It doesn't always work.
4042520	4046520	But it's more likely to get you laid than the alternative,
4046520	4049520	which is like, hey, my name is Jerry.
4049520	4050520	What's your name?
4050520	4051520	Angela?
4051520	4053520	Cool, cool.
4053520	4055520	Doing a bring your stand-up show.
4055520	4056520	A lot of friends are coming.
4056520	4057520	It's not a date.
4057520	4059520	It's not a date.
4059520	4061520	Yeah, if you want to come, that'd be great.
4061520	4063520	I'll be Facebooking you later.
4063520	4065520	So we agree on something.
4065520	4067520	Ask women out.
4067520	4069520	That's a great way to avoid...
4069520	4072520	Ask them out to dinner.
4072520	4075520	Say, let's watch Breaking Bad together.
4075520	4080520	Like, tell them basically, I'm interested in you.
4080520	4082520	That's what you did.
4082520	4085520	Yeah, first I said platonic drinks.
4085520	4086520	I did that once.
4086520	4087520	That's my limit.
4087520	4089520	I said, hey, platonic drinks, right?
4089520	4090520	Yep, okay.
4090520	4091520	How can you turn that down?
4091520	4093520	Because you'd be a monster.
4093520	4096520	That's my bear trap.
4096520	4099520	That's the friend zone working for you.
4099520	4102520	Then, after platonic drinks, you go, guess what?
4102520	4106520	Someone's interested in something a little bit more happy.
4106520	4109520	And then they tell you yes or no.
4109520	4111520	The difficult thing is not being afraid of the no.
4111520	4112520	That's the horrible thing.
4112520	4115520	Because you feel like if they say no, then your balls fall off.
4115520	4117520	And a fish hook grabs you.
4117520	4120520	And it turns out you lived in a pond your whole life.
4120520	4123520	And someone gets to eat you if women don't like you.
4123520	4128520	All right, we're going to do a welcome to the rapid fire round.
4128520	4130520	This is the part of Hermit Town.
4130520	4133520	All of my answers will be three words.
4133520	4136520	Okay.
4136520	4138520	Okay, should I put on music?
4138520	4141520	No.
4141520	4145520	Because you will press a button and it will be a velociraptor.
4145520	4147520	Are you sure?
4147520	4148520	All right, you're right.
4148520	4149520	I'm sorry.
4149520	4150520	Okay.
4150520	4152520	What is true love?
4152520	4159520	You don't have to limit yourself.
4159520	4161520	I'll have my hand up.
4161520	4163520	Dying for another.
4163520	4164520	All right.
4164520	4167520	How do I know it's love?
4167520	4174520	You died, sir.
4174520	4178520	My wife isn't a redhead.
4178520	4181520	What should I do?
4181520	4184520	Show her...
4184520	4190520	Claire all.
4190520	4191520	All right.
4191520	4194520	What's too gross of an age difference when the lady's older?
4194520	4197520	I, lady in parentheses, and 31.
4197520	4202520	Seven.
4202520	4204520	But...
4204520	4206520	Awesome.
4206520	4209520	I don't know if it had to be a minimum of three.
4210520	4221520	What are your views on masturbation in parentheses of the sexual and artistic kind and then an asterisk and its effect on romantic relationships?
4221520	4224520	I do it constantly.
4224520	4226520	Thank you, everybody.
4226520	4228520	This has been Hermit Town.
4228520	4232520	Let's give her dead Harman.
4232520	4236520	If you guys want to talk to me, I want to thank people.
4236520	4238520	You're playing the thing.
4238520	4243520	I want to thank some people that are involved in the show now that we're actually podcasting it.
4243520	4245520	Also, if you want to...
4245520	4249520	I'll take a little break, but I'll be hovering around here if you want to talk to me.
4249520	4251520	I don't want to be presumptuous about that.
4251520	4253520	I don't pretend that anyone wants to talk to me.
4253520	4255520	Guys, it really means a lot to him, so please come up and talk to him.
4255520	4258520	I want to thank you for coming to a Hermit Town Town meeting.
4258520	4260520	We'll do another one next week.
4260520	4265520	I want to thank Katie Levine for doing the audio recording here on site.
4265520	4273520	Zach McKeever for doing all things technical, making sure we don't pop and whistle and everything, audio related.
4273520	4276520	Emily Gordon, who I don't think is here, but she's the producer of the live shows.
4276520	4279520	Her idea to do this in the first place.
4279520	4284520	Daniel Kramer, the program director, and Mo Fathilbab.
4284520	4286520	God damn it, Mo. Did I get that right?
4286520	4288520	Fathilbab? It's Egyptian.
4288520	4292520	Mo Fathilbab is the on-site director, and Daniel Kramer is the program director.
4292520	4294520	Dustin Marshall is our podcast producer.
4294520	4298520	He's in charge of making sure we can get out of the air for you.
4298520	4305520	I also want to give a very special thanks to Jenny Fine, who made our Hermit Town winning logo for the Hermit Town podcast.
4305520	4308520	Thank you, Jenny.
4308520	4310520	Thank you so much.
4310520	4311520	Dustin Marshall.
4311520	4312520	I thank Dustin Marshall.
4312520	4316520	I'm going to fucking break up with you as soon as the show's over.
4316520	4317520	Thank you for coming.
4317520	4319520	No one's amused by that anger.
4319520	4321520	It's always been funny to me.
4321520	4323520	I'm from Wisconsin.
4323520	4324520	Thank you so much.
4324520	4325520	I love you, Dan. Dan, I love you.
4325520	4326520	I love you, too.
4326520	4330520	Thank you for coming to our Valentine's edition of Hermit Town.
4330520	4332520	I'll see you next week.
