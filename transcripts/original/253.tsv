0	16760	From glorious Uptown Burbank, once again, Harman Town is now in session.
16760	22520	It's so good to be back.
22520	23520	We missed you guys.
23520	27320	You know who I missed the most?
27320	29320	The Gamemaster, Spencer Crittenden.
29320	34320	Oh yeah.
34320	42320	And I never stopped missing the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
42320	48320	Thank you, thank you very much.
48320	49320	Thank you.
49320	50320	What a crowd.
50320	51320	What a crowd.
51320	52320	Yeah.
52320	54720	So there's too many variables for us to track.
54720	59640	We now don't know, is Saturday night a better night?
59640	66640	Have we been slowly, because my liberal views have slowly seeped out, and have they alienated
66640	72280	one Nazi that's been replaced by five Democrats?
72280	76040	Or are Bernie Kratz just more patient, or do they have less to do on Saturdays?
76040	79240	I don't know.
79240	82800	We took off a bunch of weeks off, should we just do the show once a month and then have
83800	84800	heightened interest?
84800	85800	We don't know.
85800	87800	Steve Levy with the ice, everybody.
87800	91800	Steve Levy.
91800	96800	Flattered by your numbers and your applause, thank you.
96800	98800	Was that a sneeze or Italian?
98800	99800	He said frost.
99800	100800	He said what?
100800	102800	I think he said frost.
102800	103800	Frosty.
103800	104800	Frosty?
104800	105800	Frosty?
105800	106800	I hope not.
106800	108800	Could be Tourette's.
108800	109800	We don't know.
109800	112800	You can't make fun of people anymore.
112800	118800	We've got an internet now, where no matter how silly someone is, you can find out how
118800	119800	they feel.
119800	123800	It just ruins everything.
123800	127800	If like Octomom happened tomorrow, there would be like a Tumblr blog from her the next day
127800	133800	where she's just like, here's how it feels to be Octomom, and we'd be like, fuck me.
133800	136800	Yeah, be an Octomom.
136800	138800	Everything.
138800	142800	We're in a mire of information.
142800	145800	We're not learning anything.
145800	147800	We're not getting smarter.
147800	149800	We're getting scared.
149800	151800	We're chimpanzees and we just have alarm signals.
151800	154800	We talked about that in our pockets.
154800	158800	And also, list the thing to talk about in our pockets, too.
158800	160800	Like, hmm.
160800	164800	I was watching intervention again.
164800	168800	This note could be from anywhere any time in the last 10 years.
168800	172800	And someone used the phrase short end of the stick, and Cody, my girlfriend, brought up
172800	173800	an interesting point.
173800	175800	Like, I've never really examined that phrase.
175800	178800	Cody was just like, what's with this short end of the stick?
178800	179800	Wait, wait.
179800	180800	Just pull the stick.
180800	182800	You get a whole stick.
182800	184800	Why is the short end of the...
184800	186800	How can you have a short end of a stick?
186800	188800	It doesn't even make sense.
188800	192800	Maybe it's like, you know, drawing straws or maybe like a thing where you have to grab
192800	196800	it and whoever has less stick, that's the person that's chosen.
196800	200800	A stick has two ends and neither are shorter than the other, for sure.
200800	204800	But if two people are grabbing it at the same time, maybe one end is sticking out.
204800	209800	But you're referring to that crazy baseball bat game with the hands.
209800	210800	That's a total guess.
210800	211800	Well, wait.
211800	212800	Let's just think about this, you guys.
212800	217800	If you were to grab a stick, which end would you grab?
217800	221800	The short end or the tall end?
222800	223800	There is no...
223800	224800	Yeah, no, the tall end.
224800	226800	You would grab the tall end.
226800	231800	If you're a baseball player, you want the short end because you need more bat to be able to hit the ball.
231800	232800	That's crazy talk.
232800	236800	How do you know when you're grabbing...
236800	241800	How do you grab the tall end by putting your hand lower or higher?
241800	245800	Oh, I'm just saying that you've got to grab the tall end.
246800	251800	I can understand because we have wish bones in our culture.
255800	258800	But that's shaped like a slingshot and you pull and there's a way to get the short end.
258800	264800	And also short end of the stick, it always means there's not luck involved, usually.
264800	266800	Short end of the stick is more like...
266800	267800	Oh, yeah.
267800	273800	We decided to do a designated driver program and then my turn came up on prom night.
274800	276800	I kind of got the short end of the stick there.
276800	280800	It wasn't like a luck of the draw as much as it was like I got fucked by the system.
280800	282800	Short end of the stick.
282800	284800	I agree with Cody.
284800	287800	Don't be such a cynic.
287800	288800	Just grab the stick.
288800	290800	You've got a whole stick.
290800	292800	Now you won the stick contest.
292800	295800	You've got a fucking whole stick, whatever that's worth.
295800	300800	You're imprisoned in a matrix where you're valuing ends of sticks and someone's laughing at you.
300800	303800	Big stick is laughing at you.
303800	306800	Long stick is laughing at you.
306800	310800	Boy, this new note-taking app.
310800	313800	It just says leaks. That's all it says.
313800	317800	It looks like it used to be the worst end of the staff.
317800	320800	And then it got changed to the short end of the stick.
320800	322800	I was just reading about it.
322800	324800	There's the wrong end of the stick.
324800	326800	The wrong end of the staff.
326800	328800	It's a medieval origin thing.
328800	332800	So to be on the wrong end of the staff, the short end, I don't know.
332800	337800	Again, I would want to be on the short end because there's less stick to get hit with.
337800	340800	If somebody's waving you this much stick, they're not going to get you.
340800	342800	I can whack you that much.
342800	344800	See what I'm talking about?
344800	348800	I want to be on the shorter end of my stick.
348800	350800	I want you on the wrong end of my stick.
350800	351800	I understand what you're saying.
351800	354800	You're saying that if someone's holding a stick,
354800	360800	then if the long end is pointing at you, then you're getting stabbed.
360800	365800	If the short end is pointing at you, they're committing Harry Carey in front of you.
365800	367800	Right.
367800	373800	But the expression means to get the shit end of a bargain or to get something wrong.
373800	376800	Right, and it's inverted in your end with you there.
376800	379800	That's why I would have been the first to die in the medieval times.
379800	382800	You know what always hangs me up is the business end of things.
382800	384800	I know I'm at the business end of a revolver.
384800	387800	I'm not sure. I've got to remember what you mean by that.
387800	390800	I don't know. Are you holding the revolver or are you about to get shot?
390800	392800	The business is where the bullet comes out.
392800	395800	Are you the customer of a revolver if you're getting shot?
395800	398800	I don't know. You pay no money.
398800	400800	You go cruising for bruising.
400800	404800	You are stimulating the marketplace by being a dead person.
404800	406800	I want more of those.
406800	408800	You're in the market for getting shot.
408800	410800	Yeah.
410800	412800	You're entering the market.
412800	416800	I was watching intervention and there was a woman today.
416800	418800	Here's the thing about intervention.
418800	420800	I watch it relentlessly.
420800	423800	Of course, this is the joke. I'm addicted to intervention.
423800	428800	But here's my confession about intervention as I think I've confessed before.
428800	432800	It's truly a guilty pleasure beyond like let's watch Gremlins 2 guilty pleasure.
432800	436800	This is truly a guilty pleasure because I watch intervention with Cody.
436800	438800	Absolutely.
438800	447800	We pick and choose who deserves recovery based on what they did to earn their addiction.
447800	452800	If you got molested, pass. You're done. You're fine.
452800	456800	I don't care how much of a prick you are to your parents at 35
456800	458800	and how much coke you need to keep doing.
458800	462800	If there's some story from your past where you went camping and someone was like,
462800	465800	let me show you how to fish and then they meant something else.
465800	467800	You can do as much coke as you want.
467800	470800	You can throw chairs at Jeff Van Vandra and I don't care.
470800	474800	You're cool. I root for you. I hope you recover.
474800	480800	There was this Indian guy who was adopted by this beautiful white Christian family.
480800	484800	They looked like a crazy 80s Christmas card, this family.
484800	487800	And also as an extension of their Christianity,
487800	491800	they adopted this kid from India who was like two years old when he came over.
491800	495800	He probably only had the vaguest unconscious memories.
495800	499800	He was found in a pool of diarrhea or something.
499800	506800	They were rescuing a human from a part of the earth where the parents weren't in surplus.
506800	510800	But then he grew up as part of this Christian family.
510800	514800	They thought, oh, you're so brown but we love you.
514800	516800	They were kind of like doing it wrong.
516800	518800	They were like, you look just like us to us.
518800	520800	It's just sort of war on them.
520800	523800	And then he's like, I don't know. I kind of feel better when I do heroin.
523800	526800	And they're like, yeah, but Jesus would be even better than that heroin.
526800	530800	And it's like, so he had my permission to be all fucked up.
530800	533800	But then Candy Finnegan comes in through the skylight.
533800	534800	She's like, I was adopted.
534800	538800	If you're adopted, Candy Finnegan will sort your shit out, man.
538800	541800	Sorry. Anyways, just the intervention.
541800	542800	There was a woman.
542800	547800	She said she's been addicted to crack for 30 years.
547800	551800	I mean, mission accomplished.
551800	554800	Did she invent crack?
554800	558800	She must have smoked the first crack and she's doing fine.
558800	561800	Yeah. She knows exactly how much to not do.
561800	565800	Yeah. She's like Mr. Robot with the morphine.
565800	567800	Is he Mr. Robot?
567800	570800	Don't tell me.
570800	571800	All right.
571800	574800	The pool of diarrhea.
574800	577800	I'm not being, I'm not being, I'm not trying to be like, uh, what, uh, like what?
577800	579800	I'm not saying like they adopted this kid.
579800	581800	That's so much diarrhea.
581800	583800	Well, you saw Slumdog Millionaire, right?
583800	584800	No, no.
584800	590800	I mean, like there's a pool, there's a pool of diarrhea seen.
590800	595800	It just, it sounds like it costs money to make a pool of diarrhea.
595800	601800	Like that's not something that happens from lack of upkeep that takes work and money.
601800	603800	What else is in here?
603800	605800	What if you, what, what if you were the pool guy?
605800	606800	That's the worst job.
606800	608800	You're checking the levels.
608800	613800	You're picturing like a pool swimming pool of diarrhea.
613800	617800	Why are you paying me to get leaves out of a pool of diarrhea?
617800	619800	And why did it have to be Olympic size?
619800	625800	Like what, what, this is why the Olympics don't come here.
625800	627800	I think Olympics come into LA in 2020.
627800	629800	Oh my God. I'm so mad about that.
629800	640800	I hate the Olympics, you guys, and fuck everybody and fuck America.
640800	643800	We should do the show on Saturdays.
643800	644800	We got Feisty Spencer.
644800	646800	We got a packed house.
646800	647800	I know.
647800	649800	That's one of the few things I could talk about.
649800	650800	I don't like the Olympics.
650800	652800	Because the Olympics come to town and they...
652800	654800	I don't like the IOC.
654800	655800	They're bad people.
655800	656800	They come in and they're like...
656800	657800	The International Olympic Commission?
657800	658800	Yeah.
658800	662800	They're like, give us all the money because we're the Olympics.
662800	664800	They're like a mafia.
664800	669800	They just come around and they're like, it would be a shame if the Olympics weren't allowed to happen in your city.
669800	675800	Maybe you build a couple of stadiums, maybe.
675800	681800	Every time the Olympics comes to town, when they went to London, when they went to Rio,
681800	686800	the people all go broke, the traffic sucks, you're late for work, your life is miserable,
686800	693800	and a bunch of people that run contracting for the soccer stadiums and for all the infrastructure,
693800	695800	they all get rich, but it's all kickbacks.
695800	697800	It's all their crony friends and stuff like that.
697800	699800	And the IOC is suing all the while.
699800	701800	They're just sending out lawsuits.
701800	704800	Oh, you got the gold medal burger?
704800	705800	Fuck you.
705800	706800	Pay us money.
706800	711800	You got the Olympics special because we're in your town and everyone Olympics is in your town?
711800	714800	Pay us money because you can't use the rings.
714800	716800	They're bad people.
716800	722800	They told, and our guest tonight probably knows better about this, they told people in London,
722800	726800	the commute times are going to be longer, so just get up early.
726800	728800	Go to work early.
728800	730800	That was their solve for that one.
730800	731800	Don't complain about the travel time.
731800	732800	Just work longer.
732800	735800	Wasn't there a bus driver's strike around then, too?
735800	736800	I don't know.
736800	737800	Who cares?
737800	742800	And it's all under the umbrella, obviously, just as everything in Hollywood is under the umbrella of,
742800	748800	like, oh, you're a PA and you don't like being awake for 16 hours and changing my cat's box.
748800	749800	Like, what?
749800	751800	You hate Marilyn Monroe or something?
751800	757800	You know, it's like we get away with a lot of abuse in Hollywood because it's Hollywood and everyone wants to be in it.
757800	768800	So the Olympics got to be like, oh, your city doesn't want the single global, I'm trying to riff the,
768800	771800	you know, the Olympics are cool.
771800	776800	The Olympics represent international harmony, so you can't say I don't want the Olympics here.
776800	777800	Right.
777800	778800	But I wonder how it breaks down.
778800	780800	Well, let's talk to a Londoner.
780800	788800	This guy is also an amazing stand-up that I just met on Thursday, and then I kept running into him.
788800	789800	I'm like, come on, come on the show, man.
789800	793800	He's got this documentary series that you can tell from.
793800	796800	I can tell from the trailer is really good, but haven't actually seen it.
796800	797800	It's on Viceland.
797800	801800	It's called Hate Thy Neighbor, but you can absolutely tell it's awesome.
801800	804800	Please welcome Jamali Maddox.
818800	822800	Can you talk like a chimney sweep?
822800	823800	No.
823800	824800	That's the thing.
824800	827800	It's like people think we actually talk like that.
827800	831800	But me saying it right now, I think that I probably do sound like a chimney sweep.
831800	832800	To us, you do.
832800	833800	To us.
833800	835800	I'm like saying it like we don't all talk like chimney sweeps.
835800	838800	The neighbor was like, you sound like a chimney sweep.
838800	842800	You sound more like a chimney sweep than us doing our best impression of a chimney sweep.
842800	843800	Right.
843800	848800	But then, as well, I know coming here, I didn't realize that people get surprised of this accent coming out of this face.
848800	849800	Right.
849800	856800	People expect a guy riding a horse, and then I come along and go, hey, you know, brown skinned dude.
856800	860800	You think we expect you to be riding a horse with that accent?
860800	866800	I thought people expected me to be white, but they want to jump and race too quickly.
866800	871800	I mean, the whitest thing in the world would just be coming down the street on a horse.
871800	874800	That's how white people are living nowadays, man.
874800	876800	That's the Trump dream.
876800	877800	Yeah.
877800	878800	Well, we're going to be back to it, yeah.
878800	879800	Well, why do people get horses?
879800	880800	A horse on every stable.
880800	882800	That's what's making America great.
882800	884800	Let's go back to that day and time where everybody rode horses.
884800	886800	That's what making America great means.
886800	892800	If you could just have enough technology to breed horses that ate coal, we would be very happy.
892800	894800	That would be our dream.
894800	900800	So you could have literally a 10-horsepowered horse, and then everyone could just like, yeah,
900800	903800	and they would just be waiting and shit outside.
904800	909800	There would be like a holiday where all the poor people cleaned up the shit and played Frisbee with it.
910800	912800	Playing Frisbee with the shit.
912800	914800	To what extent?
916800	917800	Wait, why did that get a laugh?
917800	919800	Did I ignore a question or did I?
919800	922800	You just very nonchalantly glossed over.
922800	924800	He said, why play Frisbee?
924800	925800	You said why?
925800	926800	Okay, that's why.
926800	929800	Yeah, I recognize that laugh as Dan ignored a question.
930800	933800	Why Frisbee as opposed to what?
933800	935800	Then a plastic Frisbee.
935800	936800	I don't know why.
937800	944800	This isn't going to hold up to a lot of questions, but I was imagining that like, I guess I have
944800	952800	ancestry from Oklahoma, and there's like a lot of jokes about like buffalo chips.
952800	953800	I don't know.
953800	960800	It was like disc shaped like manure, and I think there's like people that like throw it in contests.
960800	966800	Maybe that was in my iCloud, but I was just generally kind of like imagining like, how would
966800	971800	corporate America turn cleaning up shit into a sport or a fun activity?
971800	974800	It's a great activity next to your pool of diarrhea.
975800	977800	It's extreme shit.
978800	980800	Not a juice sponsor in it.
980800	994800	But while we're on questions, because I'm a big fan of linguistics, so to most of us that
994800	999800	aren't that cosmopolitan, I think maybe those of us that listen to NPR are like at a level of
999800	1007800	American that has the sense that, okay, John Oliver's accent is lower class in its origins
1007800	1011800	than like say the two other British people that I worked with on Community.
1012800	1019800	Like Tristram Shapiro was a director and he sounded more like James Bond than John Oliver
1019800	1023800	and then John Oliver would tell you he's from some part of London or something like.
1023800	1026800	Really? I kind of saw John Oliver as a posh dude for it.
1026800	1027800	Really?
1027800	1032800	Yeah, I mean, you know, I think over here people, so you can tell the class difference in voices.
1032800	1033800	No, we can't.
1033800	1037800	You know what we have because we were discussing this the other day.
1037800	1041800	American hegemony dictates that you're forced to know what an Alabama Walmart is
1041800	1045800	and I don't know what a We're Just Sure Wayne's Codding is.
1046800	1048800	To the point where I made it up.
1048800	1050800	That's where somebody poops on your chest.
1050800	1056800	But, you know, we have like we would tend to maybe like there's people with Southern accents.
1056800	1061800	Like we have a whole culture thing here that's where you associate certain accents with stuff.
1062800	1065800	What am I explaining? I'm explaining this.
1065800	1067800	I like know the least about it.
1067800	1074800	But the UK is like this compressed area and you go there and even within the boundaries of London.
1074800	1080800	It's so confusing to Americans, I think, because our history is 200 years long
1080800	1083800	and was defined by everyone going, I don't like this.
1083800	1086800	I'm leaving and like everyone just spread out.
1086800	1091800	You have to grow up million miles from someone to sound different from them in America.
1091800	1097800	And in the UK, which predates cars and predates like the land of milk and honey
1097800	1100800	where you just fucking split when you don't like a vibe.
1101800	1108800	Like you walk one block from the Queen's English with the epicenter of it.
1108800	1113800	And as I'm about to steal somebody's stand up, it was Rick.
1113800	1114800	Rick Overton.
1114800	1117800	Yeah, I had the joke about going to London and being like, I'm a blot.
1117800	1119800	You can see the palace from here.
1119800	1122800	How does the bread go this bad, this close to the bakery?
1123800	1126800	Because because people are talking ugly.
1128800	1129800	So where are you from?
1132800	1133800	Please, please, please.
1133800	1135800	Oh, yeah.
1135800	1139800	See, that's British right there is like the way that I apologize to him.
1139800	1140800	I apologize back.
1140800	1141800	But no, please.
1142800	1144800	But yeah, no, I'm from the east of London.
1144800	1145800	So I'm from East London.
1145800	1147800	So that's like working class area of back job.
1147800	1148800	Yeah.
1148800	1154800	So like when God damn it, fucking Borat.
1154800	1155800	God damn it.
1155800	1156800	Sasha Baron Cohen.
1156800	1157800	Yes.
1157800	1158800	When Sasha is doing Ali G.
1158800	1160800	Is he doing East London?
1160800	1161800	Okay.
1164800	1165800	Okay.
1165800	1166800	No.
1166800	1167800	No.
1168800	1172800	That's not like that is a that I'm trying to be so polite.
1172800	1174800	Are you talking about chavs?
1174800	1175800	No.
1175800	1176800	Okay.
1176800	1177800	Sorry.
1177800	1180800	This weird thing now where it's like, like they call him chav.
1180800	1183800	Chav is just a way to insult work across.
1183800	1184800	Right.
1184800	1185800	I don't think Ali G.
1185800	1186800	Did.
1186800	1187800	I think Ali G.
1187800	1188800	Was set up to satirize in people doing that.
1188800	1193800	But if there was this big influx was this new blackface coming up to me going like,
1193800	1194800	Oh, what's going on, brother?
1194800	1195800	What's going on, bloods?
1195800	1198800	And it's this whole thing of like, and it's like, I'd rather just call me the end word
1198800	1199800	and let me get on with my day.
1199800	1200800	Do you know what I'm saying?
1200800	1204800	It's just this constant thing of this justified bullshit, you know?
1204800	1208800	And it's like, so that accent isn't no one's accent.
1208800	1209800	No one actually.
1209800	1210800	Oh, well, okay.
1210800	1211800	Yeah.
1211800	1216800	So he's so he's doing, but is that to say that he's doing a very cartoonish version
1216800	1219800	of an accent that does exist that you can point more?
1219800	1220800	Yeah.
1220800	1221800	Okay.
1221800	1223800	But it's more of a cultural thing, like kind of a hip hop kind of.
1223800	1224800	Yeah.
1224800	1229800	It's the UK version, but that particular accent, like no one is like, that's so cartoony
1229800	1231800	that no one actually speaks like that.
1231800	1232800	Right.
1232800	1233800	And it's actually borderline.
1233800	1234800	Maybe I don't want to use the word offensive, but whatever.
1234800	1235800	No, I never found it offensive.
1235800	1236800	I didn't find the offensive craft.
1236800	1237800	I saw what he was doing.
1237800	1240800	I feel personally that he was taking the piss out of people that would do that.
1240800	1244800	But at the same time, like people would mimic that.
1244800	1247800	That's a good segue to what you're currently doing for a living.
1247800	1252800	Because it seems to me like the word offensive probably has a lot more callous around it
1252800	1257800	for you because you're right now drawing a paycheck, going around talking to Nazis
1257800	1261800	and stuff like your show is hate thy neighbor, which I haven't seen yet, but I can't wait
1261800	1262800	to.
1262800	1267800	But because you're just going in because I don't I can't tell from the trailer.
1267800	1276800	Are you are you so like outside of the whole like concentric constant cosmology that you're
1276800	1279800	like, yeah, race is bullshit.
1279800	1281800	And this guy is a white militant.
1281800	1282800	This guy's a black militant to me.
1282800	1283800	And what's the difference?
1283800	1285800	Or are you like actually just going these are weirdos.
1285800	1287800	Let's poke him or somewhere in between.
1287800	1288800	Like what's your guy?
1288800	1289800	I mean, did you know what?
1289800	1293800	Like what like because I do stand up in it as well when the stand up is worth the through
1293800	1294800	line.
1294800	1295800	And a lot of people would like that.
1295800	1296800	We have to tell them what the show is.
1296800	1298800	And they were like, oh, he's going to take the piss out of me.
1298800	1300800	I go, listen, I will only take the piss out of your ideas.
1300800	1301800	I never take the piss out of you personally.
1301800	1302800	I never say.
1302800	1304800	And this fat dude or this skinny guy.
1304800	1305800	Right.
1305800	1307800	But like you say that to the subject of the show.
1307800	1308800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1308800	1309800	Yeah.
1309800	1310800	Yeah.
1310800	1313800	Like I'm honest and I say to him like I don't agree with anything you say where everything
1313800	1314800	you believe in.
1314800	1315800	I do not believe it.
1315800	1317800	I think you have mental illness.
1317800	1319800	I think what you believe is crazy shit.
1319800	1321800	But you know, I'm willing to hear you out.
1321800	1324800	But then if the sign that comes up that I don't believe in.
1324800	1325800	I'm going to say it.
1325800	1329800	And so when it cuts to you doing stand up in the show, I mean, Are you not you talking
1329800	1331800	about going and doing these interviews and how are you not?
1331800	1333800	How are you not taking the piss out of the people?
1333800	1334800	I'm taking the fact that their ideas.
1334800	1337800	I think if their ideas are being willing to put up, then they've been willing to take
1337800	1338800	the piss out of.
1338800	1339800	Right.
1339800	1340800	You know what I'm saying?
1340800	1341800	Yeah.
1341800	1342800	I feel like that's OK.
1342800	1343800	I mean, I don't think like those are people with no teeth.
1343800	1344800	I'm not going to say you no teeth.
1344800	1345800	Really?
1345800	1346800	Yeah.
1346800	1347800	So that's really.
1347800	1351800	You know, I think that's like, you know, that's like my thing where I didn't want to
1351800	1353800	do that because that's easy.
1353800	1356800	That's a line that we're becoming conscious of now.
1356800	1361800	That's like it's like newly forming in the sand for us, especially with comedy, because
1361800	1368800	it's like if you're a big fat dude and you're racist and I mean, it's like really like
1368800	1373800	it makes perfect sense to us that that turn about as fair play and we should just talk
1373800	1374800	about how fat you are.
1374800	1376800	And we're kind of like trying to find the lines there.
1376800	1381800	Like we've just now figured out that you can't just talk about how disgustingly ugly
1381800	1382800	Kellyanne Conway is.
1382800	1387800	Like you have to focus on the disgusting ugliness of her ideas.
1388800	1392800	I'm standing and I sit here and I say that I have all this morality.
1392800	1396800	There's one time where I did do that and took the piss out of them personally.
1396800	1400800	It's because they insult me so much because they basically like basically what it is.
1400800	1403800	I went to this Ku Klux Klan bar in Georgia.
1403800	1405800	Yeah, I should do.
1405800	1407800	I went to this bar and surprise, surprise.
1407800	1409800	I weren't allowed in.
1409800	1410800	I think it's because I wear glasses.
1410800	1411800	I don't know.
1411800	1413800	So let me in.
1413800	1418800	And then the guy comes out and he's like saying like, look, man, you can't come in because
1418800	1424800	we spoke to the other Nazis and we had a meeting and they said, if you come in that we can't
1424800	1425800	guarantee your safety.
1425800	1426800	Right.
1426800	1429800	And the best bit was I was with my all white camera crew and they said the camera crew can
1429800	1431800	go in, but you can't go in.
1431800	1432800	Right.
1432800	1433800	And I was like, that's fucked up.
1433800	1434800	So my camera crew went in.
1434800	1437800	But little did they know that all of my camera crew were Jewish.
1437800	1440800	They were little Jews.
1440800	1446800	They went in and they're filming it and the owner of the bar comes across the road and
1446800	1452800	he says, he's like, why are you standing there with binoculars?
1452800	1456800	And I said like, oh, they said I can't come inside.
1456800	1458800	And then he goes, you can come inside now.
1458800	1463800	And I said, no, I won't go inside because at that point I was like, if I'm not good enough,
1463800	1465800	then I ain't good enough now.
1465800	1468800	What changed their tune after time passed?
1468800	1469800	Because it wasn't the owner.
1469800	1471800	It's like the owner of the Ku Klux Klan bar.
1471800	1473800	This is the best bit is I was telling him about all the racism I heard.
1473800	1476800	And at one point he went, what in my Klan bar?
1476800	1477800	He was surprised.
1477800	1478800	What, here?
1478800	1479800	Oh, hell no.
1479800	1480800	Not here, sir.
1480800	1481800	No.
1481800	1483800	And he was like, and then at one point he goes, you should come inside.
1483800	1484800	We've got good chicken wings.
1484800	1485800	I swear to God.
1485800	1487800	And I was like, and I was pretty lordy.
1487800	1488800	No, he didn't say that.
1488800	1489800	That's what it's called.
1489800	1490800	That's not bullshit.
1490800	1492800	And you're like, listen to my voice.
1492800	1493800	Yeah.
1493800	1495800	Do I like that you said, I want a curry.
1495800	1498800	I like that you said he didn't say that, but he owns a Klan bar.
1498800	1499800	He's like, I don't know.
1499800	1500800	I don't know.
1500800	1501800	He's like, I don't know.
1501800	1502800	He's like, I don't know.
1502800	1503800	He's like, I don't know.
1503800	1505800	He's like, he's putting such a fine point on it.
1505800	1508800	It's like, it's like, it's really committing to being the stereotypical.
1508800	1511800	It brings up an interesting point and also a scary area though, because I think a lot
1511800	1516800	of us are more comfortable with the idea that that's what Nazis are.
1516800	1521800	The behavior you just described that they're like Sims that when they see a
1521800	1525800	person of color, they go, nope, nope, nope, because, because that sort of assures
1525800	1526800	their destruction.
1526800	1530800	It's like, it's like looking at MP3s and being like, no, thank you as a record
1530800	1531800	industry.
1531800	1532800	You're just like, okay, see ya.
1532800	1537800	That's, that's the, that's, that's the hard part is because on that same episode,
1537800	1538800	so I had all that happen.
1538800	1541800	Got, you know, I got my life friend, like someone's friend to lynch me and stuff
1541800	1542800	like that.
1542800	1547800	And, uh, so people, um, so people sent lynch me and then I went to this other
1547800	1552800	guy's house named Dan and, uh, and, uh, Dan Burnside and I spent time with him
1552800	1555800	and his family, his wife hated me, but he was, and we, we built this weird
1555800	1559800	relationship where he had these fucked up views that we were totally different
1559800	1560800	on.
1560800	1563800	But then he was like, uh, actually not a bad guy since he had these messed up
1563800	1564800	views.
1564800	1565800	And that's where the weirdness came into it.
1565800	1569800	Cause like, I'm trying to, you know, uh, uh, do this documentary with this guy
1569800	1573800	where people will like, he's a likable guy, but he just has these horrible,
1573800	1574800	apparent views.
1574800	1577800	And it's that weird thing of, you know, isn't it?
1577800	1580800	I mean, we, we, we keep on, we had a guy that did a documentary.
1580800	1583800	We didn't, we didn't have the subject of it and I can't remember his name and I
1583800	1586800	should, but, uh, the subject of the documentary is this guy that in America
1586800	1587800	for decades.
1587800	1591800	That's been his thing is that he counsels probably maybe with people you've sat
1591800	1594800	down with, um, uh, that he, he, he sits with them.
1594800	1600800	He's a black guy and he, and he talks to, and he, and he collects their old, uh,
1600800	1601800	hood uniforms and all this stuff.
1601800	1603800	And he has a big collection of, you saw that documentary.
1603800	1604800	Yeah.
1604800	1605800	I didn't see the documentary, but I heard about it.
1605800	1606800	Yeah.
1606800	1607800	You should watch.
1607800	1609800	He done people where I did with as well.
1609800	1610800	Right.
1610800	1611800	Yeah.
1611800	1614800	That name almost sounds familiar that Burnside guys, I remember that going like,
1614800	1617800	that seems like a name that Rob Schrod would name something in a comic book.
1617800	1623800	But the, um, isn't that the scarier thing or I'll speak for myself.
1623800	1625800	That is the scarier thing.
1625800	1629800	It's that it's these, it's these Twitter conversations.
1629800	1635800	It's the idea that, that, oh, they, they're not just like keystone cops that
1635800	1639800	live in basements and shine their jack boots under posters of Hitler that they
1639800	1642800	only cover up if their Jewish meter reader comes over.
1642800	1649800	Like they're, they're, they're, they're out among us and they're, they're
1649800	1653800	comfortable enough buying fruit loops in a grocery store full of people of
1653800	1654800	different races.
1654800	1656800	But it does.
1656800	1660800	That doesn't make them jump up on a box and say, I can't be in this room.
1660800	1662800	There's too many black people.
1662800	1665800	Um, because that would be easy to handle.
1665800	1670800	And what's, what's scary is that they're just like, ha ha ha and joking around
1670800	1672800	with us and influencing elections.
1672800	1676800	And like that now that's, I mean, I wonder if what's scary about that is that it's
1676800	1680800	like, it forces us to do battle with ourselves because all of a sudden there's
1680800	1685800	not just a Cobra action figure that you can throw down and say, GI Joe won.
1685800	1686800	Yeah.
1686800	1690800	Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's the sort of, uh, cause being with that, the Nazis
1690800	1692800	and the Klan and all of that, right?
1692800	1695800	The dudes that wear the robe and where the swastika teacher and walk around and
1695800	1698800	go like those guys.
1698800	1699800	Sorry.
1699800	1700800	Sorry.
1700800	1702800	I'm an expert in the Nazis.
1702800	1705800	My memory is that some secret language there for you.
1705800	1713800	But anyway, so dear Harmon town, I have never been more offended as I sit here
1713800	1716800	in my compound, sharpening my bayonet.
1716800	1720800	I regret that America has fallen to bigotry.
1720800	1727800	Your guest, Jamali Maddox did an impression of a Nazi anyway.
1727800	1728800	Sorry.
1728800	1729800	But it's like, yeah.
1729800	1733800	So it's like those dudes, uh, uh, funny enough aren't the scary ones because you
1733800	1734800	know where they are.
1734800	1737800	And to be completely honest with you, man, that's what's making, what's what kind
1737800	1740800	of weird about from cause I, I was making a film.
1740800	1744800	I didn't want to be like, Oh my God, worry about these eight guys.
1744800	1748800	I mean, because it's just eight guys in the, it doing, it's burning a swastika
1748800	1749800	badly.
1749800	1750800	Right.
1750800	1754800	But it's the, it is the guys who then don't suits worry about.
1754800	1759800	It's the guys that have, that have decided that's a marketplace and who maybe half
1759800	1763800	believe those guys and half don't at any rate are like, I like votes because you
1763800	1764800	can't, you can't.
1764800	1769800	The thing is like, uh, um, the thing of like this whole idea of a white utopia
1769800	1772800	where you're going to walk around and only see other white people and go, Oh, good
1772800	1773800	white day.
1773800	1774800	It doesn't exist.
1774800	1780800	The guy, the leader of that group lived in Detroit.
1780800	1786800	How, how can you live in Detroit and not once interact with anyone from any other
1786800	1787800	race?
1787800	1788800	You can't.
1788800	1789800	It's literally important.
1789800	1790800	You would not eat.
1790800	1793800	Well, what you see in that documentary, when you watch it, you want to do nothing.
1793800	1796800	When you watch that documentary, there's two things you might, you might notice.
1796800	1798800	One is that all of these guys get tired.
1798800	1803800	Like, like I think racism and misogyny, both kind of like, you don't become a
1803800	1806800	good person, but you can get bored with hatred.
1806800	1812800	Like you, you, especially if you are well-heeled, like prosperity and age, even
1812800	1814800	independent of each other, but especially combined.
1814800	1821800	There's nothing, there's nothing more harmless than an old, uh, rich, uh, former
1821800	1822800	monster.
1822800	1824800	Like, they're just like, did it nailed it.
1824800	1825800	Bye.
1825800	1827800	Um, I'm going to eat some Cheetos and play some video games.
1827800	1829800	And it's like, they might not have atoned with anything in themselves when the
1829800	1832800	most active parts of their lives were the, you know, the most important.
1832800	1836800	And so you see a lot of that and you also see young people of color asking the
1836800	1841800	question of this older activist who, you know, is so admirable in his, in his
1841800	1844800	willingness to go into the mouth of a lion like that.
1844800	1849800	But then they're saying like, so you made 50 old ex-racist friends and we're out
1849800	1853800	here in the streets inhaling tear gas with cops that say they're not racist and
1853800	1854800	all this stuff.
1854800	1855800	So it's like, that's why you got to watch it.
1855800	1856800	Cause it's just fucking amazing.
1856800	1858800	It's one of those things where there's no heroes or villains.
1858800	1861800	You just walk away, bummed and confused and like freaking out.
1861800	1863800	And then you go back to England and you're like, fuck them.
1863800	1866800	Um, I thought the episode in England, it was the same show over there.
1866800	1867800	Yeah.
1867800	1868800	Well, no, that's right.
1868800	1869800	It might be worse.
1869800	1870800	I don't know.
1870800	1871800	I guess that's the other place that we can go.
1871800	1873800	So I wanted to talk to you about that, but, uh, can I ask you, can I ask you a
1873800	1874800	quick question?
1874800	1877800	Um, when you do the show and don't, without revealing too much about what the
1877800	1880800	secret, the magic trick of making that show great, you know, like in the
1880800	1885800	production side of it, but how much like, did that bar know you were coming or
1885800	1888800	did you guys just roll up on that, on that KKK bar in Georgia?
1888800	1894800	This was the, this was the issue is that, uh, so my, uh, producers had to go to
1894800	1898800	the bar the night before because they were planning the swastika line because
1898800	1901800	what it was, it was all these different white power groups coming together to
1901800	1902800	form a super white power group.
1902800	1904800	And they were all coming together.
1904800	1905800	Racist Voltron.
1905800	1906800	Yeah.
1906800	1909800	Just go together.
1909800	1911800	It's like the Holocaust never happened.
1911800	1912800	Right.
1912800	1914800	As I say, we, we aren't the world.
1914800	1916800	We can't all be the right arm.
1916800	1918800	We can't all be the right arm.
1918800	1920800	Somebody has to be a link.
1920800	1921800	That's funny.
1921800	1922800	Yeah.
1922800	1925800	So, um, yeah, so it was all, it was all that.
1925800	1928800	And then, so then they, so they had to go over there because our connect, our
1928800	1932800	link, uh, was the leader of the, uh, uh, national socialist movement.
1932800	1934800	And he said we could.
1934800	1937800	And then when we got there, they were like, so he was like, Hey, I got this
1937800	1938800	documentary from group.
1938800	1939800	Okay.
1939800	1940800	Okay.
1940800	1941800	And the presenters, uh, uh, Brown skin dude.
1941800	1942800	Yeah.
1942800	1943800	He ain't coming in here.
1943800	1944800	Right.
1944800	1945800	So then my producer had to go to my producer there for like, I was trying to
1945800	1946800	convince him to let me in.
1946800	1948800	But the one guy was knew that you were coming.
1948800	1949800	Oh, yeah.
1949800	1950800	Yeah.
1950800	1951800	Yeah.
1951800	1952800	He knew I was coming.
1952800	1953800	And, uh, then he got outnumbered in votes.
1953800	1954800	They had that info.
1954800	1957800	And, uh, so then they were like, he can't come inside or he can't come.
1957800	1961800	So I came anyway with, uh, with a deck chair and beers.
1961800	1962800	Okay.
1962800	1963800	So I knew they won't let me in.
1963800	1966800	So I was watching the swastika line from the side of the road.
1966800	1970800	And, uh, and then the guy came in because the owner wanted us to move the
1970800	1971800	cars into the lot bit.
1971800	1973800	And so, uh, the guy came in.
1973800	1974800	So then they knew I was there.
1974800	1975800	Yeah.
1975800	1979800	There's a thousand Nazis doing a, doing a parade and you're a lone black
1979800	1981800	dude with binoculars across the street.
1981800	1982800	Yeah.
1982800	1985800	That seems like a little risky.
1985800	1986800	Yeah, man.
1986800	1987800	Yeah, man.
1987800	1988800	No, I've done some dumb shit.
1988800	1990800	But like, uh, yeah, I've done mad.
1990800	1993800	I've done, you know, I look back and it's like, people ask me like, uh, one
1993800	1995800	of the main questions I get asked is, was you scared?
1995800	1998800	And it's like, not at the time, only when I get back to the hotel.
1998800	1999800	Cause I've done dumb shit.
1999800	2003800	Like I went, I went to this white power music festival in Ukraine.
2003800	2005800	And we didn't have security.
2005800	2006800	Ooh.
2006800	2007800	Like, no security.
2007800	2009800	And I remember they asked, asked me, do I want security?
2009800	2010800	And I was like, no, man.
2010800	2011800	I know karate.
2011800	2012800	And I don't know karate.
2012800	2015800	But I wanted to sound confident at the time.
2015800	2018800	And, uh, we, and we just got, and then people like threatened, you know,
2018800	2020800	it's like a mad, you know, it's a mad thing that I did.
2020800	2021800	I wouldn't, I don't.
2021800	2022800	Yeah.
2022800	2023800	What, what is it propelling you then?
2023800	2026800	If fear isn't stopping you, what is propelling you?
2026800	2027800	Is it?
2027800	2029800	I thought, I thought, I.
2029800	2031800	And what is it?
2031800	2034800	By the time I realized what I was doing, I already signed the contract.
2034800	2035800	To do the show.
2035800	2036800	And you're like, I gotta do the show.
2036800	2037800	Right.
2037800	2041800	That would make me, if I, if I like accidentally sold myself as some kind of
2041800	2044800	like social evil, Knievel, I would commit to it.
2044800	2049800	I mean, if I, like, cause I'd be like, fuck, the only thing worse than eating
2049800	2052800	this tarantula egg is looking like a dipshit.
2052800	2057800	Like, like, this is like, I want to keep it funny.
2057800	2058800	So I'm sorry.
2058800	2059800	He's going to take a dip here.
2059800	2061800	They're used to dips on this show.
2061800	2062800	I appreciate it.
2062800	2064800	But what, what, what kind of drove me with the show?
2064800	2066800	The show is hosted by a dip.
2066800	2067800	Okay, very long.
2067800	2070800	It's like, I've done like the first episode and it was kind of light and then
2070800	2072800	the second episode got really heavy.
2072800	2078800	And all I remember is that, like, the reason I carried on, like, and was willing
2078800	2083800	to do crazy shit and dumb shit was like, I went to this, like, refugee camp.
2083800	2085800	And it was like the most depressive thing I ever seen in my life.
2085800	2086800	You know what I'm saying?
2086800	2087800	It was like sadness.
2088800	2091800	You know, I've never seen, like, sad, sadder shit in my life.
2091800	2095800	And if I want to, it's something that's so sad, no matter what spectrum on the
2095800	2099800	political debate you are, if you're right wing or left wing, that you can't negate
2099800	2101800	how sad that thing is, you know?
2101800	2107800	And that kind of, and for people to sort of, not even just say, look, we don't want
2107800	2111800	them here for economic reasons and, you know, and those reasons, which, you know,
2111800	2113800	which is debatable, you know, you can have those debates, but it's the people
2113800	2115800	saying, fuck them, they're dirty.
2116800	2118800	You know, that they're dirty.
2118800	2124800	I couldn't not then go and try and understand why the fuck they think like
2124800	2125800	that.
2125800	2126800	Right.
2126800	2127800	But who are you talking to that feels like that?
2127800	2130800	It's all people that are only reading about it on Facebook, right?
2130800	2132800	Nobody that's ever come close to.
2132800	2133800	Of course.
2133800	2134800	I mean, there's that as well.
2134800	2142800	But, you know, I know being there is way more heartfelt and, you know, visually
2142800	2144800	crazy and you're there and you feel it.
2144800	2147800	But even like watching that shit on YouTube, I can't look at that and be like,
2147800	2148800	fuck them.
2148800	2149800	You know what I'm saying?
2149800	2154800	No, no, my therapist has alerted me to the fact that the cells in your body,
2154800	2160800	including the cells that react to light and symbolism and things like your body
2160800	2166800	doesn't have a gland that filters for Facebook and YouTube or film and TV.
2166800	2171800	Your body, if it sees what is unmistakably a man who's been shot by a
2171800	2176800	police officer and the gun is trembling in the cops hand while his wife behind
2176800	2179800	the camera is taping and his kids in the back seat and the blood seeps through
2179800	2180800	his clothing.
2180800	2184800	And you try to go to work that day and you just get your world's greatest
2184800	2185800	grandpa coffee mug.
2185800	2193800	And like we act like that's different, way more different than I saw a guy get
2193800	2195800	shot today and watched him die.
2195800	2199800	Like we there may be some little difference because it was on Facebook and
2199800	2200800	you could close the laptop.
2200800	2203800	But your body experienced trauma.
2203800	2204800	Anyways, whatever.
2204800	2207800	I explain things.
2207800	2217800	But when you went to a refugee camp, what I'm curious about is because I feel
2217800	2220800	we keep hearing about this refugee crisis.
2220800	2224800	The crisis is that a bunch of people need to get the fuck out of somewhere
2224800	2225800	where they're going to die, right?
2225800	2231800	And then you see transcripts of Trump talking to the Australian PM and he's
2231800	2236800	like it's 1,200 people that Obama made a deal with to take in.
2236800	2241800	Like there's people all over the place that need to get the hell out of dodge.
2241800	2244800	And I'm not trying to get out of soapbox.
2244800	2249800	What I'm trying to wrap my mind around is it's sort of like the thing we have in
2249800	2253800	America where we have this like pedophile thing where there's a chart of like how
2253800	2258800	much we think about pedophilia and it doesn't correlate to a chart of pedophilia.
2258800	2261800	And I'm wondering about this refugee thing.
2261800	2263800	Like how big is the problem?
2263800	2268800	And the other thing I'm wondering is when you go to the site where you are face
2268800	2275800	to face with a refugee, is there anyone in that area that is either that isn't
2275800	2281800	a paid to tow the line of like keeping them miserable?
2281800	2284800	Like that person just has to, that's their job.
2284800	2287800	If you ask that person, they have to tell you, this is my job.
2287800	2289800	Is there anybody?
2289800	2292800	There's nobody around there that's going, yeah, keep them out.
2292800	2295800	Oh, I mean, do you know?
2295800	2296800	Sure.
2296800	2297800	It's that kind of show.
2297800	2298800	Oh, yeah, no, sweet.
2298800	2302800	I was like, shit.
2302800	2305800	My name's Matt Thomas with Service Federal Operations.
2305800	2306800	Well, first of all.
2306800	2308800	Are you going to attack me?
2308800	2315800	First, it sounded like you said Matthew McConaughey.
2315800	2317800	My name is Matthew McConaughey.
2317800	2319800	Wait, it's not your real name.
2319800	2321800	Your name is close to that, but it's not.
2321800	2323800	My name is Matthew McConaughey.
2323800	2324800	Oh, McConaughey.
2324800	2325800	McConaughey.
2325800	2326800	Okay, okay, yeah.
2326800	2328800	All right, all right, all right.
2328800	2331800	Without revealing anything that's going to get me arrested, I used to serve in
2331800	2334800	Special Operations from 2001 to 2007.
2334800	2336800	Can you explain what Special Operations is?
2336800	2340800	I was a ranger in the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.
2340800	2343800	Can you explain what that is?
2343800	2348800	Imagine that most of us have just come from playing with Legos for 30 years.
2348800	2351800	He was in a super elite branch of the Army.
2351800	2353800	Okay, like the Navy's had to seal.
2353800	2355800	I mean, I can sugarcoat it.
2355800	2357800	I was really good at killing people.
2357800	2360800	The Rangers are like the Navy Seals of the Army.
2360800	2362800	Okay, that's offensive, that's offensive.
2362800	2364800	Let's say that for another podcast.
2364800	2365800	Okay, all right, all right.
2365800	2366800	You said it best.
2366800	2369800	Your point is you've had elite access to...
2369800	2370800	Right.
2370800	2371800	No, not even that.
2371800	2374800	Actually, before that, I was in the big Army, which is like the guys that
2374800	2376800	join at a high school, and I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.
2376800	2378800	I'm going to play saxophone in the Army Band.
2378800	2379800	Oh, wait, I'm in the infantry.
2379800	2380800	Here we go.
2380800	2384800	I feel like this might break into a thing about, I know the truth about the
2384800	2385800	Illuminati, man.
2385800	2389800	So I went to a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq in 2000...
2389800	2392800	When did we invade Iraq?
2393800	2394800	Yeah, it's been a long time for me.
2394800	2395800	It's been rough.
2395800	2397800	I mean, we've never stopped invading Iraq, I think.
2397800	2398800	I know, yeah.
2398800	2399800	When did that stop?
2399800	2401800	It's sort of like visiting your parents.
2401800	2402800	I know, yeah.
2402800	2403800	We just do it when we need laundry done.
2403800	2405800	I have so many friends who are still there.
2405800	2406800	It's like, okay, good.
2406800	2409800	But yeah, I went there during the invasion invasion, and then about like
2409800	2412800	seven months in, we went to...
2412800	2414800	I hope I'm not going to get killed for this.
2414800	2416800	We went to the Turkish...
2416800	2420800	There's a Turkish refugee camp in Iraq, and those people were so scared,
2420800	2423800	and really, at the end of the day, what it comes down to is people are
2423800	2424800	afraid.
2424800	2427800	Like, those people, they had a small armament there.
2427800	2430800	Like, weapons that we didn't even have.
2430800	2431800	Like, 50 cal...
2431800	2435800	They had at least three madooses there, 50 caliber machine guns.
2435800	2438800	They had machine guns left over from World War II that I...
2438800	2442800	Which, you know, if I could have saved them, I could be rich right now.
2442800	2446800	But I didn't, because I was young and dumb.
2446800	2449800	Anyways, it was really interesting to talk to these people.
2449800	2452800	I bought an owl off of one of them for 40 bucks.
2452800	2454800	It was pretty cool.
2454800	2460800	Was your job to keep people from getting somewhere?
2460800	2461800	No.
2461800	2467800	My job was to show up every day, not die, and not kill anybody, I guess.
2467800	2469800	But sometimes, you know, it happens.
2469800	2470800	That's my job.
2470800	2472800	I know, yeah, exactly, yeah.
2472800	2473800	We were just...
2473800	2475800	We were talking about refugee, like...
2475800	2476800	Yeah.
2476800	2477800	Whoo-hoo!
2477800	2483800	We're talking about refugee camps.
2483800	2484800	Right.
2484800	2486800	The fact that we're like...
2486800	2487800	Right, I mean...
2487800	2493800	We're having these moral quandaries about whether we let in refugees, whether we judge them, police them, shut them out.
2493800	2496800	How many refugee camps are there in where you live?
2496800	2497800	That's up in the hills?
2497800	2498800	What is that?
2498800	2499800	That's...
2499800	2500800	I drive up there all the time.
2500800	2501800	What is that?
2501800	2502800	That's...
2502800	2503800	Blue Speedless.
2503800	2504800	No, Blue Speedless, yeah.
2504800	2506800	How many refugee camps are there up there?
2506800	2507800	There's none.
2507800	2510800	I think there's like a monastery that I'm a little suspicious of, but...
2510800	2513800	I think they mainly do aromatherapy.
2513800	2514800	Here's...
2514800	2515800	Katie Perry bought that, you know.
2515800	2516800	She did.
2516800	2517800	Oh, really?
2517800	2518800	Yeah.
2518800	2519800	Here's my input on that, is that...
2519800	2521800	So, I've been to refugee camps.
2521800	2526800	I bought an owl off of a kid that was probably something, like, you know, five foot nothing.
2526800	2527800	40 bucks.
2527800	2528800	The owl or the kid...
2528800	2530800	Was it a five foot owl, or was it...?
2530800	2532800	His name was Harry Potter.
2533800	2534800	All right.
2534800	2535800	No, no.
2535800	2537800	And he tried to charge me $500 next to the railroad.
2537800	2539800	So far, this sounds like a pretty cool refugee camp.
2539800	2541800	It was pretty cool.
2541800	2543800	You could buy guns and an owl.
2543800	2544800	Yeah.
2544800	2545800	Oh, yeah.
2545800	2549800	They had a ton of weapons, but at the end of the day, what it was is they were scared.
2549800	2551800	Like, they had no idea what was going on.
2551800	2554800	And we had just invaded their country, which they already...
2554800	2556800	It wasn't even their country.
2556800	2561800	They were guests in the country that was hosting them.
2561800	2564800	They escaped from another country.
2564800	2569800	And this other country that we had largely reputed as being...
2569800	2571800	Well, it was led by a tyrant.
2571800	2573800	But they were scared.
2573800	2574800	It's fear.
2574800	2577800	At the end of the day, fear drives all human emotion.
2577800	2579800	It drives all human activity.
2579800	2585800	And at the end of the day, you can talk shit about every human being that you want to,
2585800	2588800	but fear is what drives us.
2588800	2590800	It's so overpowering.
2590800	2592800	We're not better than fear.
2592800	2594800	We're not better than what created us.
2594800	2597800	I'm still trying to place you on a map of ideology, though,
2597800	2600800	because I felt like we were just talking about something that didn't even really happen.
2600800	2601800	Oh, yeah.
2601800	2602800	No, I'm crazy, yeah.
2602800	2603800	I went to the DNC.
2603800	2605800	I went to the Democratic National Convention.
2605800	2606800	And I was a burnocrat.
2606800	2610800	And I got chewed out by a bunch of people that hated me.
2610800	2612800	Whoo!
2612800	2614800	But I also used to kill people for a living.
2614800	2617800	You presented yourself as if you had a kind of counterpoint.
2617800	2620800	We were talking about how refugee camps are a bad place to be.
2620800	2622800	Well, I've got a thing or two about that.
2622800	2625800	And you're like, you got to remember, they're shitty places and everyone's scared.
2625800	2628800	And I bought an owl.
2628800	2630800	And I don't...
2630800	2632800	That's fair.
2632800	2634800	And he said if he could do one thing different,
2634800	2636800	he would have bought more weapons from them, because he would be rich.
2636800	2637800	That's true.
2637800	2639800	How many weapons have you bought from a refugee in your life?
2639800	2641800	That's the second time you've done that thing.
2641800	2643800	Are you high-roading me about refugee camps?
2643800	2645800	How many have I done this?
2645800	2646800	Just the one.
2646800	2647800	You're not embracing it.
2647800	2648800	That's fair.
2648800	2651800	It's the profit of possibilities of going to a refugee camp.
2651800	2655800	I was providing my input as to actual refugee camps in a war zone.
2655800	2656800	Right.
2656800	2658800	Like the real world that we don't live in currently.
2658800	2659800	They're bad places.
2659800	2661800	The refugee camps are bad places.
2661800	2664800	Let's hear it for Matthew McConnelley, everybody.
2664800	2665800	Matthew McConnelley.
2665800	2666800	Thank you, sir.
2666800	2667800	Special ops.
2667800	2668800	Thank you, Dan.
2668800	2670800	Let me say one point, though.
2670800	2672800	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
2672800	2674800	That guy, that guy kind of scared me a bit.
2674800	2678800	But, like, I went to two.
2678800	2681800	I went to one in Sweden, and I went to the Cannes one.
2681800	2682800	Not the Cannes one.
2682800	2683800	That's the film figure.
2683800	2685800	I went to the one in Calais.
2685800	2686800	I went to the refugee camp in Calais.
2686800	2688800	I went to the one in Sweden.
2688800	2693800	There was a lot more sort of hope there, and there's a lot more, you know,
2693800	2696800	people sort of saw the end of the tunnel in terms of, you know...
2696800	2699800	Well, yeah, because Swedish refugees, I mean, what are they, fleeing massage?
2699800	2700800	Yeah.
2701800	2702800	No, this isn't a refugee camp.
2702800	2703800	I mean, these are entitled people.
2703800	2705800	I got to get out of Sweden.
2705800	2708800	This chocolate is too creamy.
2708800	2710800	I got to build my own furniture.
2715800	2717800	Are these Syrian refugees, I'm assuming?
2717800	2719800	Yeah, these are from people from all over.
2719800	2721800	But what I will say is that, so there is, you know,
2721800	2723800	I did see a difference, you know.
2723800	2726800	And I went to the one in Calais the day it burnt down.
2726800	2727800	And that was the fucked up one.
2727800	2729800	That's the one that kind of changed my life a bit, watching that shit.
2729800	2731800	Why did it, why did the camp burn down?
2731800	2736800	Because, well, there was two, there's two stories that I heard that day.
2736800	2739800	Number one is, because basically it was the day that they were kicking everyone out
2739800	2740800	to bulldoze it over.
2740800	2744800	And one of the accounts was that the refugees were burning down their homes.
2744800	2749800	And the account number two was that there was sort of a nationalist,
2749800	2751800	a foreign nationalist burning down their homes.
2751800	2755800	And so there was two kind of, but like I saw, like I saw one guy,
2755800	2760800	who my camera guy knew, who was, so my camera guy's walking and he just,
2760800	2762800	and he sees this guy and he just hugs him.
2762800	2766800	And this guy, he's looked like he hasn't like fucking slept for like a year.
2766800	2768800	And he's just covered in soot.
2768800	2769800	Hasn't what for a year?
2769800	2770800	Slept for a year.
2770800	2771800	And he's covered in dust and dirt.
2771800	2774800	And he was saying how like, where are all these fires?
2774800	2776800	He's just like a volunteer fire guy.
2776800	2780800	And he's going and fighting these fires that are getting kicked off.
2780800	2783800	Because all that generators and stuff, so it's like stuff catching the light and that.
2783800	2784800	So, you know.
2784800	2785800	I don't understand brave people.
2785800	2789800	And that includes Matthew McConnelley and you and some journalists we've had up here.
2789800	2797800	My hat's off to anybody that serves and that is fleeing.
2797800	2799800	There was a quote I saw on Twitter.
2799800	2802800	That is black and goes to a KKK bar in Georgia.
2802800	2804800	That's fucking, that's not brave.
2804800	2805800	That's just nuts.
2805800	2806800	Yeah, it's dumb.
2806800	2807800	There's no bravery.
2807800	2812800	I think bravery is kind of like, all I did was just make a mediocre hour show.
2812800	2814800	There wasn't like, oh, bravery.
2814800	2816800	I was cutting this line, bro.
2816800	2821800	You've been doing stand-up and I've seen it and it's like, you're very good.
2821800	2823800	You've been doing it for like four years.
2823800	2826800	That's not your roots, right?
2826800	2827800	Or is it?
2827800	2828800	What was your...
2828800	2831800	Before I'd done the documentary, I always did stand-up.
2831800	2836800	I tried to act and I was awful, man.
2836800	2840800	I probably delivered the lines like, give me your money now.
2840800	2841800	I got that guy.
2841800	2844800	But now, it was fucking horrible.
2844800	2846800	But yeah, I was a stand-up, man.
2846800	2850800	So I'd done my first show at 16 and I got booed off stage.
2850800	2853800	And then I didn't do it again until I was like 18.
2853800	2855800	You must be quite young now, then.
2855800	2856800	I'm 26 now.
2856800	2857800	Okay.
2857800	2859800	You're very young.
2859800	2860800	22-year-olds don't think so.
2860800	2861800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2861800	2862800	That's like a weird thing.
2862800	2864800	It's like the oldest I've been.
2864800	2865800	Yeah, exactly.
2865800	2868800	So I can't look at it and tell you like, oh, I'm really, I'm just the oldest.
2868800	2869800	This is the furthest I've lived.
2869800	2874800	I remember 27 is the worst because you're too old to complain, but you're too young
2874800	2876800	to complain about that.
2876800	2881800	And so at 27, you just spend a year at the object of judgment of everyone older and younger
2881800	2882800	than you.
2882800	2886800	They're like, fuck you, old slash young man.
2886800	2889800	I like that you sort of ruined my next birthday.
2889800	2890800	But I will tell you this.
2890800	2891800	You see your next birthday.
2891800	2893800	That whole year is going to be terrible.
2893800	2897800	But 27, I think, is the best.
2897800	2903800	Like, short of 29, but 27, I think, is a little better because it's syllabically more complicated.
2903800	2909800	I find syllabically complicated, odd numbered birthdays are fucking fantastic for when you
2909800	2914800	want to say, I'm blank years old, I don't have to put up with this shit.
2914800	2921800	Whether it's helping someone move, driving to the airport, or buying a Honda, like whatever,
2921800	2922800	you could just randomly apply it.
2923800	2926800	Somebody's like, well, do you want the, maybe you should get this car.
2926800	2927800	And you're like, I'm 27 years old.
2927800	2928800	I don't need that fucking car.
2928800	2931800	And they're like, wow, that sounds like it's true.
2931800	2934800	It's a great putting your foot down here.
2934800	2936800	I'm constantly saying now I'm 44 years old.
2936800	2938800	It just doesn't sound legit.
2938800	2939800	They're like, so?
2939800	2941800	Yeah, you still got douche at 44.
2941800	2943800	Yeah, like tacos when you're 47.
2943800	2944800	What else?
2944800	2946800	I'm 47 years old.
2946800	2948800	We're having a clown on the show.
2948800	2952800	And people would be like, no, Dan is close to death.
2952800	2954800	He speaks with that power.
2954800	2956800	Spencer, how old are you?
2956800	2958800	I'm 28.
2958800	2961800	No, 27, eight.
2961800	2963800	28.
2963800	2966800	See, 27 is a birthday you don't even want to admit.
2966800	2969800	So you just have to put leaves on it and run away.
2969800	2973800	He took a year less life to say, I'm 28, I'll take a year less.
2973800	2976800	I think we'd all skip 27 if we could, for some reason.
2976800	2978800	There's that one thing you can just say at Hot Topic.
2978800	2979800	I'm 27 years old.
2979800	2982800	Yes, get out the XLs.
2982800	2985800	Hey, Jamali, how many of the episodes?
2985800	2987800	You said you did six already.
2987800	2989800	You got 10 more coming up, you said?
2989800	2991800	Yeah, that was the first one to say that, but fuck, I could say it.
2991800	2994800	Yeah, I might be doing more, I think.
2994800	2996800	Oh, are we allowed to talk about that?
2996800	2997800	I don't know, man.
2997800	2998800	There was one thing you were telling me.
2998800	3001800	I don't read the contract, but I'm sure they'll sue me if I fuck it up.
3001800	3002800	I'm sorry.
3002800	3003800	Can you talk?
3003800	3004800	I don't read that.
3004800	3005800	What if I just got your show canceled?
3005800	3006800	Yeah.
3006800	3007800	That'd be amazing.
3007800	3008800	That's right.
3008800	3011800	There was a guy you were telling me about today, when we first met.
3011800	3012800	Yeah.
3012800	3013800	You told me about the fish guy.
3013800	3015800	Oh, yeah, not after the day.
3015800	3016800	Okay, yeah.
3016800	3018800	You'll have to wait for the fish guy.
3018800	3022800	And you won't know he's the fish guy because the fish had nothing to do with it.
3022800	3030800	So just as an ambassador of the UK, since November, but also it was like Brexit was happening
3030800	3034800	and then November was happening in the States, the elections were happening around the same
3034800	3035800	time.
3035800	3038800	But there was like, Trump was tweeting, they're going to call me Mr. Brexit because I think
3038800	3042880	his point was, it's kind of like talking about a dolphin.
3042880	3050120	I think what he was saying was like, everyone keeps assuming that nationalism doesn't have
3050120	3057800	a foothold, but pretty soon they're going to say, I'm also a nationalist.
3057800	3065800	I'm curious, like on the world stage now, it was easy three years ago to say, you didn't
3065800	3075200	even have to ask a Canadian or an England-ish person or any of these other yahoos, you never
3075200	3077320	had to say like, what do you think about America?
3077320	3080240	Because you knew the answer would be like, tuh, not America, tuh.
3080240	3083240	And you'd be like, you're jealous.
3083240	3089880	Now it's actually the irony of nationalism, it seems to me, is that it's like we're all
3089880	3092120	experimenting on a global scale.
3092120	3093720	This is happening all over the world.
3093720	3100320	All the countries are becoming more childish, more secure, more isolated, which actually
3100320	3105560	makes the conversations like, what do you think about America more interesting and like
3105560	3106560	less predictable?
3106560	3113200	Because it's like, what has been happening over there, like how do you guys, we're over
3113200	3114200	here like kind of going like.
3114200	3116520	You asked me, how do we process America now in England?
3116520	3119280	Yeah, like what's, I mean, obviously that answer is that you can't make a statement
3119280	3122680	for all of England, but the circles you run in or like the, I don't know, like what's
3122680	3123680	the.
3123680	3131760	I mean, we kind of had the rise of sort of like really more hard or right politics in
3131760	3132760	England.
3132760	3137040	And I think it's sort of been, I think it's the same as, and I think people I speak to
3137040	3142760	kind of understand that like a large push of the more right wing ideas is because of
3142760	3146600	the large push of the other left wing ideas, you know?
3146600	3152400	And I think when both of those ideas get bigger, they sort of react on the others and everyone's
3152400	3153400	left in the center.
3153400	3154400	Do you know what I'm saying?
3154400	3157680	It's like, you know, other like, you know, I'm not far left wing, but I'm not far right
3157680	3158680	wing.
3158680	3159680	You know, there's people in the middle.
3159680	3161880	And that debate's never spoken about.
3161880	3166120	And it's like, we've always kind of had this idea that you, you people were crazy.
3166120	3170400	Now we always have like your cokes are too big, your food, everything's just too big.
3170400	3173560	Like we just, we just think you're mental and you're like the Las Vegas of the planet.
3173560	3174560	Yeah.
3174560	3175560	Like we think you're crazy.
3175560	3176560	Everything's legal over there.
3176560	3178520	It's better to have a TV show there.
3178520	3182560	You know, now we think, you know, it's so it's like, you know, I wasn't mad shocked when
3182560	3183560	Trump got in power.
3183560	3184560	You know what I mean?
3184560	3187980	I wasn't, you know, me personally, I wasn't, I wasn't shocked, you know what I'm saying?
3187980	3191500	Because I think what Trump does, because I kind of felt it in England of that it's
3191500	3197460	sort of like, oh boy, it's that time when Spencer's car gets pretty good at it.
3197460	3200700	But I could go take care of that.
3200700	3204940	It really is his car.
3204940	3210100	I thought he was doing a bit, he was just using that as a cheap opportunity to go get
3210100	3211100	high.
3211100	3212100	Yeah.
3212100	3213860	That could, I mean, Spencer would have like an egg timer.
3213860	3214860	Yeah.
3214860	3217540	That his car, he tells his car, call me out to get high.
3218540	3223260	10 minutes before the weed, the weed is way too strong here.
3223260	3224260	The weed is strong.
3224260	3225260	The weed is ridiculous.
3225260	3229940	Oh, because you guys are like, I know, don't cheer it.
3229940	3230940	It's disgusting.
3230940	3231940	I hate it.
3231940	3232940	No, man.
3232940	3233940	No, that weed is too much, man.
3233940	3234940	You can't, you can't enjoy it.
3234940	3235940	It's just, I can't.
3235940	3245140	Well, I agree with that, but I'm from the country of 44, like, like, like, like, like,
3246140	3252940	yeah, I mean, I fuck Harmon, get your shit together.
3252940	3258940	There are people from the Rangers here tonight fucking have some fucking integrity.
3258940	3264460	I got a, I got a 10 of mints that were like, like, it's like, they're like, there's like,
3264460	3269980	there's this gourmet kind of like, that's the nice thing about legalization is like,
3269980	3274420	now there's like, this guy gave me, he's, he's, he's shooting some stuff with Star
3274420	3275900	reference, and it's about drugs.
3275900	3280980	And so some people, some companies gave him some stuff and I get like this gourmet, like,
3280980	3287500	like gilded, like, 80s dark chocolate kind of like wrapping and like, there's a, there's
3287500	3288500	mints in there.
3288500	3294900	Like you suck on one and you get just barely high, like, for two hours.
3294900	3298140	And it's anyways, that wasn't worth commenting on.
3298140	3302620	There is a, there's a little, I mean, I think that the kids these days of which you are one,
3302620	3308940	you've, you've invaded American soil, but I think the kids your age here, they're like,
3308940	3313540	they're fucking desensitized or something like they're smoking some monster ganja.
3313540	3318300	I just, I just don't think we should be grown by dudes in lab coats.
3318300	3320260	Like, I don't want to smoke that that's, that's too much.
3320260	3323860	I mean, I feel it should be legally okay for that stuff to happen.
3323860	3324860	It should happen.
3324860	3325860	Like, it should happen.
3325860	3329260	Well, Richard Attenborough is watching and like, like, yeah, it should have, there should
3329260	3330260	be a different thing.
3330900	3334180	I mean, we got you high.
3334180	3335220	That's how we found it.
3335220	3338700	You know, like, it didn't need to be like crossbred to the point where I'm not saying
3338700	3342540	we should make it legal, but I'm saying it for my personal taste is too much.
3342540	3344420	You know, that's what I'm saying the same thing.
3344420	3345420	And I'm saying, oh, cool.
3345420	3346420	I'm having a debate on legalization.
3346420	3347420	We don't know.
3347420	3348420	We're on the same side, bro.
3348420	3351820	I'm saying once it's, once it's so legal that it's all good everywhere, I'm saying there
3351820	3356660	will be the emergence of these things that I am old enough to find, which is like casual
3356860	3357860	Oh, dude, weed.
3357860	3363260	Perhaps me eating you out should be a little more psychedelic, you know, like just kind
3363260	3370140	of like forensics files amount of weed, you know, like, like, like that plus a pair of
3370140	3373300	bifocals should make tonight's cool way to an event.
3373300	3380700	I went into a Germania, I traveled to comedy group and Greg Proops is a comic, and if you're
3380700	3386620	aware of him and Greg, Greg, Greg smokes the strongest weed on the planet Earth as he says
3387500	3388540	like, where do you where do you get that?
3388540	3389860	He goes from Dagobah.
3390180	3395860	Yeah, I mean, if I give his weed a stern look, I'm fucking dead.
3395860	3402020	Like, it's it's but we walked into a we're up in upstate Washington, where the weed is
3402020	3405300	very that was like, it's totally freely, recreationally available.
3405820	3408660	And we walked in there and this is all the it's like 10 a.m.
3408980	3414060	And these four, like stoner dudes that are working there who all clearly know the show
3414060	3414580	that we're on.
3414580	3420380	And they just they're all really high in the morning, like, oh, so Greg is like buying
3420380	3422460	like the funkiest, hardest ass.
3422460	3425900	He's like, I'll take one of those five of these, a double whammy, a triple walnut.
3425900	3432020	Like, he knows all this, all this, you know, the whammy and the walnuts, man, that right
3432020	3432860	up in the ice cream place.
3432860	3439060	But but I had to talk to the guy like, what's the weakest shit?
3439700	3445140	And the easiest, the just the worst, like, what, like, what wouldn't you smoke?
3445580	3449420	And Greg had to walk over to him and like to explain, like, like, slum it, like, like,
3449420	3451700	what stuff that you would be bummed out if somebody offered it to you.
3452020	3454900	And I took that and I went and got some chocolates at this place in Seattle.
3454900	3456620	And I sat in my hotel room as the best.
3456780	3459420	Yeah, I was as high as I could possibly be.
3459420	3461860	But like, Greg stuff, forget about it.
3461900	3467220	Yeah, I just I go to Portland or I got I got I just I just go like I'm my grandma has
3467220	3475300	back pain. And then they give me what gets me high enough to like, have an end up on
3475300	3482420	TMZ. I wish I hit you with a lot of stuff that you're like, wait a minute.
3482420	3490580	What? But but I did want to ask you, like, so just now let's talk about comedy, but relating
3490580	3494180	to politics, because here you are, you're you're you're half my age, you're British.
3494860	3497540	And and but now we're living through this time.
3497540	3499700	So your perspective is totally different from mine.
3499700	3509500	But like, what is a comedic creatives obligation or what what is a good philosophy to
3509500	3518180	follow when shit hits the fan on a global scale this much because I can't I just keep
3518180	3526740	falling back on if it seems like you're in a history book, then politics aren't politics,
3526740	3530780	their current events, if it doesn't seem that way.
3531580	3536260	But but I don't know how much of that is a refraction of like, but what you're so what have
3536260	3538820	you thought about this? Like, how political am I allowed to be?
3538860	3544980	Yeah, you know, like when it comes to comedy and writing comedy is it's like I try to just
3544980	3550580	be honest about how I feel about that thing and not try and tell the line of being like,
3550580	3553260	I'm going to say is because I think this has a moral obligation.
3553580	3556060	Do you know what I'm saying? I don't think I'm morally obligated to buy anything.
3556140	3557780	Right. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm a free person.
3558020	3562700	And like, my person and my thing as well is like, I'm not even like I'm willing to hear a
3562700	3564780	point of view I don't agree with in comedy sometimes.
3565140	3566780	Do you know what I mean? I find that shit interesting.
3567060	3569540	You know what I'm saying? So if there's a dude who has a totally different political view to
3569540	3571140	me, there's a comedian out there who has that view.
3571300	3575580	Like, say it, you know, as long as it's funny and, you know, say that that's your freedom to do
3575580	3577900	it, you know, like, I believe in freedom in comedy.
3578340	3581820	So like me personally, I don't think I'm morally obligated that like, oh, these things are
3581820	3584980	happening and I must put on my black toe and they can smoke a cigarette.
3585380	3587740	And so I say, this is what's wrong with the world, man.
3587740	3588980	Like, I don't know what I'm saying.
3588980	3593620	Like, I'm, I'm a comedian, a weird area because some some comics have the philosophy that I do
3593620	3599780	understand, which is that comedy is its own political party, where we're like, we're supposed to
3599780	3601420	be funny above and beyond anything else.
3601420	3606940	Anything that impedes in humor is like, that's fucking Satan and you should do it.
3606980	3612420	Like, I think if you have the the opinion and the intelligence and the and the and the point of
3612420	3614660	view and it's funny, then put it out there.
3614660	3615820	Do you know what I mean? I think that's great.
3615820	3616980	And I want to hear it. You know what I'm saying?
3616980	3620780	But in the same time, I don't think I think I think there's also I don't think every comedian
3620780	3621660	should now be Bill Hicks.
3621660	3624340	I think I think if someone does one line, it's coming to you when you're one.
3624340	3625060	Like, do you know what I'm saying?
3625060	3626100	Well, you definitely have to be.
3626100	3627100	Yeah, you have to be honest.
3627100	3627900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3628300	3632420	So there's there probably are comics out there that are probably regrettably being like, you
3632420	3639180	know what, I'm I have this opinion in that opinion, like, but everyone's just going to
3639180	3644980	boo me, you know, and that person probably you're like, you and I wouldn't want that person
3644980	3649020	to pre-sensor themselves, but we would want them to try to figure out it'd be funny.
3649020	3655300	Yeah, question. You see, like, if I'm over here, is there is it is it hard to talk about
3655300	3656620	Trump, then let's talk about Bush?
3657620	3660100	Well, if you talked about Bush, this is my perception.
3660100	3665140	We're both like, if you talked about Bush now, but there's a million variables here.
3665380	3670980	But if you in my perception, if you talked about Bush, you were being a pull, you're bringing
3670980	3675100	politics into your comedy and it was like, needless.
3675580	3677980	But there was a band called the Dixie Chicks.
3678820	3684580	There still is probably and they're they're they're they're liberal ish and they were
3684580	3685700	performing in Texas, I think.
3685700	3687220	And they said that he's not my president.
3687220	3688140	We're not proud of the president.
3688140	3690180	And they got all sorts of shit.
3690460	3694340	If you go on stage now and don't talk shit about Trump like that, you that like the show
3694340	3695060	wasn't a good show.
3695060	3698740	It was like you're required to get up and talk to something really funny and ironic about
3698740	3704220	that, that it was braver to be political when we were talking about, you know, like when
3704820	3709820	politics meant a little more boring because we had things managed and then there'd be a
3710100	3712300	drone strike here or an invasion there.
3712300	3715140	And it was all manageable through Ted Koppel and all this stuff.
3715340	3719300	So so if you were a rock band and you came out and said, we're going to do some stuff from
3719300	3722420	our new album, but also I want to talk about dangling chads.
3722620	3726740	There might be like a bunch of booze, you know, that they're like booze from people going
3726740	3728300	like, fuck you, Leonard Skinner.
3728340	3733340	I wanted to just making up bands and relationships.
3733340	3739540	But but but the that's I guess that's kind of my question, which probably a 26 year old
3740340	3745140	maybe doesn't even have the answer to, which is like, how different is it now and how does
3745140	3747020	that difference equate to an obligation?
3747020	3752260	Because I sometimes I sit in my five bedroom house in Los Feliz and I go, nothing has
3752260	3753740	changed for me.
3753740	3758140	So why would my material change?
3758140	3763820	And then I go, you were talking about how you don't wash your ass like you need to keep
3763820	3765540	talking about what you're thinking.
3765580	3769340	You said that like talking about Bush was less important.
3769500	3770740	It's all subjective.
3770740	3772060	It's like less important to me.
3772220	3775620	So that's part of what it is, is that I feel like I kind of like I feel it's a little bit
3775620	3784380	of like a what do you call it a an atonement, a confession when it's when it's making up
3784380	3788260	for like like I did like amendments.
3788260	3790340	Yeah, we have penance.
3790380	3795100	She said penance, but amendments also like when you think of people, but my word also
3796780	3798060	that rhymed with your word.
3798740	3802180	But do you think do you think that if people start talking about Trump, right?
3802180	3804780	And it's sort of thing like, all right, we've got to talk about Trump.
3804780	3808580	Do you think then it becomes like fads and like people just start doing it for the sake
3808580	3811380	of doing it and then it kind of loses it's sure you see.
3811420	3813180	But I said, yeah, I think that's the danger with all.
3813220	3816900	Yeah, that danger always looms with every any issue that everyone's talking about is
3816900	3822740	that I think people who are like it's so it's so hard to unbreak from like if I were
3822740	3826500	to if I were to say, hey, Trump's a piece of shit.
3827500	3830060	And let's say I get three people booing.
3830100	3833540	One person might be booing because they're like, your comedy is lazy.
3834780	3838380	Another person might be booing because they're like, I voted for him and I want to
3838380	3839300	forget about it.
3840100	3843460	I was wrong and I came out to drown my sorrows in laughter.
3844260	3846140	Stop reminding me I'm an idiot.
3846860	3849140	And then a third person might be a ghost
3852860	3854340	who's trying to give me a treasure map.
3854340	3861580	But I don't know. It's it's sort of like it's making me very curious because it's not
3861580	3863940	like I'm like haunting the stand up clubs these days.
3863980	3868260	I'm I'm kind of like I'm I'm vastly approaching the threshold where it's like
3869820	3873780	like according to my predecessors, the baby boomers, it's like I'm getting to an age
3873780	3876420	where I can kind of clock out and be like, yeah, world's a mess.
3876420	3877420	Give me some ice cream.
3879140	3883540	You know, funny enough, a lot of people I know kind of don't even really do the
3883540	3887180	Brexit thing anymore because I think a lot of them feel it's been like played out.
3887740	3888380	I love them.
3888380	3889500	Oh, that's the third boo.
3889500	3893900	The third boo is the person like like like I think my audience might like a lot.
3893900	3898220	I was like, I please like I have watched John Oliver.
3898220	3902300	I watch I watch my Twitter feed like like like just keep talking about how you jerked
3902300	3906340	off with a sharpie in your butt once like like, you know, like like like like you don't
3906340	3907700	have anything new to say about it.
3907700	3908580	But yeah, continue.
3908580	3910780	No, no, no, no, no, no, you put my thumb down.
3910780	3913020	That's it. I mean, I'm done.
3913020	3919020	No. Yeah, you know, it's such a it's such a it's just I've never and like and you know,
3919020	3923020	I've not I've been in comedy for that many years, but I can't remember a time where it's
3923020	3924020	been like this.
3924380	3924780	Do you know what I mean?
3924780	3928980	Like this is this is this is a weird fucking time and it's hard navigating as a human being
3928980	3930020	and nagging as a comedian.
3930020	3930500	You know what I'm saying?
3930500	3936620	And sort of what what my art score reflects, you know, and you know, I think that's what
3936620	3940220	I do see a lot of is and I don't know if this is right.
3940220	3944100	But you know, I think there's some great comedians who do it and I've sort of done it
3944100	3949700	sometimes myself is people kind of see what the issue was of why maybe Trump got elected
3949700	3955020	or why Brexit happened and attack that and not necessarily attack the thing or the voters
3955020	3960860	or the you know, the image of what you know, Trump as this that one dude, you know, they're
3960860	3964980	trying to attack the things of why that happened, you know, because there's so many reasons why
3964980	3968860	that this is happening, you know, and it's and I think I think I think some of it lies
3968860	3972140	on the economics and all of that stuff that I'm not intelligent enough to understand.
3972140	3974740	But I think it also lies in social shit.
3974740	3980700	You know, I think I think, you know, we spent a long time of telling people to shut up if
3980700	3981700	we didn't agree with them.
3981700	3985540	I think that's happened for a little while now for being honest, it's crazy how the internet
3985540	3989780	is what actually is made that the most possible, like, because we all thought if you told me
3989780	3993300	if a Martian came down and pitched the technology to me and said, everyone will be connected,
3993300	3997740	I'd be like, oh, so there will be a little less binary thing.
3998180	4000020	No, this act, it's crazy.
4000020	4005300	It's like, like, we are obsessed now with firing this person, get rid of that, like,
4005300	4007820	we we we really were tough.
4007900	4011300	Yeah, that's the thing is that we live in this weird spectrum where it's like, it's like,
4011300	4015140	it's like, it's like, you know, you've got to you've got one side of this, like, say nothing.
4015140	4015900	Words hurt.
4015900	4017780	And the other side is like, why can't I say nigger?
4017780	4020500	And it's like, why can't there be a middle ground, though?
4020500	4024420	Like, you know, I'm saying that why can't we say nothing?
4024500	4027100	What? I'm just saying the words.
4027100	4028700	You know, man, that's the problem.
4028700	4031780	You know, also in England, that word means diaper.
4033820	4035540	It's just a it's a form of marmal.
4035540	4037820	Yeah, you know, as well.
4037820	4043580	No, but yeah, that that it's the it's this we we we we're having all these debates about
4043580	4045180	like what you can say, what you can't say.
4045180	4050940	And it's like that that was the other thing about that documentary that I that you have to watch.
4051580	4052340	It's 9-11.
4053340	4055340	Is that an accusation or something?
4058460	4063180	He has a lot of stand up bits driven by how he he looks a little bit like Osama bin Laden.
4064260	4065540	Yeah, but we probably should.
4065540	4069140	I probably should have done that concept for the cool guy to think that no one's ever seen.
4071380	4073300	But yeah, I don't know.
4073300	4076060	I was I it's it's God damn it.
4076060	4081220	It's it's fucking it's something that nobody could have predicted is the fact that we would
4081260	4085340	actually connect to each other telepathically and that that would actually usher in an age
4085340	4092060	of of like a really kind of weird like pre Columbus suspicion of the other.
4092060	4098340	Like it's it's almost it's like it we're we're I feel it in my own bones.
4098340	4103780	Like I I'm a really bright open minded guy that grew up on the Internet.
4103780	4112340	But we now just like we I feel like I have been indoctrinated to scanning information
4112340	4120260	on screens through a chip of is this person an enemy or an ally?
4120420	4127980	And if so, and then the flow chart proceeds from there, which is so dangerous and and so
4127980	4131860	profits only the worst of the bad guys, probably.
4132300	4135060	That's become a level of coexistence, I guess.
4135060	4138740	I mean, because because that's the thing is that in that documentary, there's these young
4138740	4144340	black activists who are sitting across from this guy and one and he says, do you think
4144340	4145420	these people can change?
4145420	4147260	Do you think a white racist can change?
4147260	4152220	And one of the guys kind of reflexively goes like, no, and they're like, oh, fuck, because
4152220	4153900	that's how we all feel about the enemy.
4153900	4158940	We don't approach them as if they're people that can change because like liberals in America
4158940	4163380	are like, I'm fucking so sick of this goddamn fucking sucking the dick of these fucking
4163380	4168500	like, like, where the fuck people you told me I forgot and trumps my punishment for forgetting
4168500	4169500	them?
4169500	4170500	Oh, can I listen to you some more?
4170500	4175140	Will they abuse us and go like, oh, snowflake that feelings me, boo boo, you won.
4175140	4176140	Fuck you.
4176140	4177140	I'm the troll now.
4177140	4178140	You Nazi.
4178140	4179140	All right.
4179140	4180140	All right.
4180140	4183540	But yeah, it's it's brought it it's heightened times.
4183540	4188820	We are more danger of we revert to fight or flight.
4188820	4193540	Or really fight and to fight like we have nowhere to go.
4193540	4196780	But so I asked you a question and then I answered it.
4196780	4197780	Yeah.
4197780	4202060	I mean, you asked the question and you answered it way more articulate and I for example, we
4202060	4203060	do one word answers.
4203060	4204060	I don't know.
4204060	4205060	I'm upset.
4205060	4211020	I feel like is this interesting for you guys?
4211020	4213340	I could usually they go like, it's 9 11.
4213340	4218300	And then like sometimes when there's like a thoughtful guest, they're like, it's 9 11.
4218300	4220060	And they're they're they're mostly engrossed.
4220060	4224420	You know, I don't want to be thrown in the spectrum now of faultfulness, you know, like
4224420	4227380	I still asked, you know, because it's like what you said as well, like, what do you think
4227380	4228380	your role is?
4228380	4231860	Like, I still want to talk about, you know, like, weird places I've come back.
4231860	4235260	I still want to, you know, I still want to, you know, well, I have a great idea when you
4235260	4239580	come back, you're here for a while working on your show, you should come back and we'll
4239580	4240580	talk about all kinds of stuff.
4240580	4241580	Thank you.
4241580	4242580	Yeah.
4242580	4248180	I'm here for Jamali Maddox coming out here, Molly Maddox, watch his show.
4248180	4256740	Hate thy neighbor.
4256740	4259500	We really have to promote that show or we violate his visa.
4259500	4260500	You have to watch.
4260500	4261500	Yeah, it sounds awesome.
4261500	4262500	Hate that neighbor.
4262500	4263500	It's a great title.
4263500	4264500	The visa thing is really complicated.
4264500	4268560	You ever talked to a UK person that comes over here, like, I remember when John Oliver
4268560	4272900	would come over to do community, it was like so fucking complicated.
4272900	4275420	It's weird.
4275420	4277860	It's weird who can get like, like, like, like who gets citizenship?
4277860	4282220	Yeah, because the last time people just left England, they started another country and
4282220	4284100	told them to go fuck off.
4284100	4286100	They've been hurt before.
4286100	4290580	Ludwig Gorinson, who did all the score for communities, Swedish, Swedish, am I going
4290580	4291580	to offend him?
4291580	4294900	Is that where he's from, Swedish?
4294900	4300820	And I had to keep, I had to, like, sign a thing that verified that he was a genius because
4300820	4305700	he was on a genius visa because he was like a visa that said, like, like, he's not stealing
4305700	4306700	a jarb, you know?
4306700	4310380	Like, it's like, you can't find a composer like this in the States, you know?
4310380	4312340	You have to, like, sign a letter.
4312340	4313580	This guy remakes music?
4313580	4317180	I can't believe.
4317180	4318180	That's how we got Spencer.
4318180	4319180	Yeah, exactly.
4319180	4322180	Spencer's here in a dungeon master visa.
4322180	4328980	I was going to say, a genius bar, because he worked at the Apple store.
4328980	4332020	Okay, so...
4332020	4333020	Let's get Levi up here, shall we?
4333020	4334020	Okay, Steve, Levi, are you in the house?
4334020	4335020	Hi, everybody.
4335020	4336020	What's going on?
4336020	4337020	How'd you think that went, Steve?
4337020	4338020	I thought it went great.
4338020	4339020	It really was great.
4339020	4340020	Yeah, I really like him.
4340020	4341020	Yeah.
4341020	4342020	I took it.
4342020	4343020	We, like, hit it off as soon as we met.
4343020	4344020	I know.
4344020	4345020	I'm glad I set that meeting.
4345020	4346020	Yeah.
4346020	4347020	Oh, you did.
4347020	4348020	That was me?
4348020	4349020	Okay.
4349020	4350020	Well.
4351020	4352020	Maybe I don't like him.
4352020	4353020	Too late.
4353020	4354020	I control my fate, is what I'm saying.
4354020	4355020	All right.
4355020	4356020	What's going down, Levi?
4356020	4357020	I'm going to start exercising.
4357020	4358020	Start exercising.
4358020	4359020	Get back on the dread thing.
4359020	4360020	I'm going to.
4360020	4361020	I'm going to.
4361020	4362020	I saw a video.
4362020	4363020	I saw myself.
4363020	4364020	Oh, no.
4364020	4365020	Okay.
4365020	4366020	Okay.
4366020	4367020	Okay.
4367020	4368020	Okay.
4368020	4369020	Okay.
4369020	4370020	Okay.
4370020	4371020	Okay.
4371020	4372020	Okay.
4372020	4373020	Okay.
4373020	4374020	Okay.
4374020	4375020	Okay.
4375020	4376020	Okay.
4376020	4377020	Okay.
4377020	4378020	Okay.
4378020	4380020	I saw myself from the side.
4380020	4381020	Oh, no.
4381020	4382020	I saw.
4382020	4383020	I saw it.
4383020	4384020	Which video?
4384020	4385020	Don't do that.
4385020	4386020	The Ryan Elder.
4386020	4387020	Oh.
4387020	4388020	This guy just music for Rick and Marty.
4388020	4389020	Yeah.
4389020	4394020	There's a shot of me talking on the phone from the side sitting and I am a, just a ball
4394020	4395020	of.
4395020	4398340	And it's, if you are, you're fine.
4398340	4404420	Don't think about, oh, I have to, like, if you're happy, like, like fucking, you're perfect.
4404420	4407020	Like, I have an issue.
4408020	4411860	And I'm old and I need to, like, it's about cholesterol for me.
4411860	4412940	It's not about how I look.
4412940	4415020	I have a fucking perfect life.
4415020	4421620	If I, if I, if I thought I could live for a thousand years, I wouldn't do anything physically.
4421620	4422620	It's that I'm worried about.
4422620	4427100	I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to make it to 69.
4427100	4428100	I believe you.
4428100	4429100	Yes.
4429100	4430100	Not for the bit.
4430100	4431100	Oh.
4431100	4436860	Like, because I can see that roughly people that men who in America who have achieved
4436860	4440860	a little bit, like, they're tending to drop off at 69.
4440860	4441860	Nice.
4441860	4449500	Like, it's, it's, and then it's like, yeah, I don't want to live to 80 if it means I never
4449500	4450500	did acid.
4450500	4451500	I did lots of acid.
4451500	4454500	I can take 69.
4454500	4456700	How much acid?
4456700	4457700	What kills you at 69?
4457700	4458700	I don't know.
4458700	4462900	No, I, no, I don't, I did acid, let's say, eight times in my life.
4462900	4465020	Did it, did it change your life?
4465020	4470580	I had a friend who, he did acid and he was a different person after that experience.
4470580	4471780	In a good way or a bad way?
4471780	4472780	In the best way.
4472780	4473780	Yeah.
4473780	4474780	Oh really?
4474780	4475780	Wait, wait, wait.
4475780	4477540	He, he joined the, my buddy Rangers.
4477540	4478540	His name is Matthew McConaughey.
4478540	4484820	No, no, my, he's like, I got to get out, I got a country to serve and he like left.
4484820	4492420	My friend Jeremy, he, he grew up in a house, uh, two chiropractors and, uh, his mom wouldn't
4492420	4498620	let him take any like, I'm sorry, did you say he lived between two chiropractors?
4498620	4499780	No, no.
4499780	4501180	His parents are two chiropractors.
4501180	4502180	Okay.
4502180	4504620	I got, I got, yeah, I don't know.
4504620	4509140	He wasn't allowed to take prescription medication, so he always lived in fear, uh, and we lived
4509140	4512780	in a bubble town and he always thought he was going to get sick and, and die.
4512780	4517780	And we went to college and, uh, there was a day where he did acid with a couple of friends
4517780	4520980	of mine and like the world opened up to him.
4520980	4526660	He started asking questions about like society and religion and like the education system
4526660	4528860	and just things he never thought about.
4528860	4534260	And yeah, you know, I mean, you see a lot of talk on intervention about, well, you know,
4534260	4539500	pots a gateway and all this stuff, but I'm like, you know, I will say that I don't want
4539500	4545940	any lawsuits cause I'm talking to anyone 20 and over like acid is a, it's a decent truck
4545940	4554660	stop to stop at, like just to check out before you turn 30, because after 30 you're, you,
4554660	4558100	you're going to be like, you're going to take acid and you're going to be like, I haven't
4558100	4559300	done my taxes.
4559300	4564860	Why am I doing acid if I didn't do my taxes?
4564860	4569020	But when you're 23, like, like, like I, I'm only speaking from my experience.
4569020	4573580	It was just like, I, I'm the biggest, uh, the word pussy's not really, I'm trying to
4573580	4580260	out mode that, but, uh, the, like, like I was the biggest, uh, pussy, um, in the world
4580260	4585340	about, about, about like, like drugs and stuff, but, but, but, but when I was in my twenties,
4585340	4590780	I was like, what, what, what, how might this kill me?
4590780	4596820	And as a result, plus being lucky, I, I, I, I did acid and mushrooms and stuff like that.
4596820	4605740	And I do think they, they give mushrooms to, uh, PTSD people, like PTSD people.
4605740	4611140	It's like the fraggle rock, like there's PTSD people in the corner, they're like dozers
4611140	4612140	or whatever.
4612140	4619180	Um, they, people with PTSD, they have clinically, I get all my news from NPR, but, uh, yeah,
4619180	4623940	that, that, that the psilocybin, like it, it, it clinically gives you a sense of perspective
4623940	4626980	that until you get it, you don't have it.
4626980	4630940	And that can actually be incredibly helpful for things that we haven't otherwise figured
4630940	4631940	out how to treat.
4631940	4636660	Uh, anyways, explained it to you, explained it to you.
4636660	4638980	Spencer, do you ever do the, uh, the acids or the mushrooms?
4638980	4641140	No, I haven't done my taxes.
4641140	4645820	No, I was just, what if you do your taxes and then take acid?
4645820	4648820	This is the best day of my taxes.
4648820	4649820	Yeah.
4649820	4650820	I don't know.
4651020	4654340	You can actually fly.
4654340	4655340	That's awesome.
4655340	4656340	It's the only way to say I'm doing your taxes.
4656340	4659060	The first time I did it, I did it with our friend Matt Young in a, in a, in a little
4659060	4662900	back house in, uh, Echo Park and it was like, it was surrounded by trees and it was really
4662900	4663900	safe.
4663900	4664900	And he's like the perfect guy.
4664900	4665900	Mushrooms or acid?
4665900	4666900	Acid.
4666900	4667900	And he goes, just do it a little bit.
4667900	4670020	And he, he walked me through it and he's like the most like caring, nicest guy.
4670020	4673300	And we just, we just sat there and listened to music and it went outside and like looked
4673300	4674780	at the trees and it was like the greatest.
4674780	4676100	It was really amazing.
4676100	4677100	I did it.
4677100	4680780	I did it in, uh, well, my friend Sean McKenna, like we were doing coke and he gave me a tiny
4680780	4681780	piece of paper.
4681780	4682780	It said, put this on your tongue.
4682780	4689420	And then I asked him what it was and he said, it was, uh, and that was my first acid joke,
4689420	4690420	but it turned out okay.
4690420	4694820	And then the second time I did it, I just, I remember being with Friedel, my, uh, high
4694820	4698780	school buddy, Dave Friedel, he've met on the show maybe, and we were in Milwaukee and we
4698780	4705780	were like, we're on acid in my house and in Milwaukee and, uh, I, I rented house.
4706780	4712940	Uh, um, and, uh, we're like ending the night with like, just have this stack of newspapers
4712940	4718780	and we were going through, uh, the family circus, uh, comics on acid.
4718780	4720620	That was fucking fantastic.
4720620	4721620	That's good.
4721620	4723620	It was, it was like, what do you mean?
4723620	4724620	What?
4724620	4725620	What?
4725620	4726620	What do you mean?
4726620	4729740	Why does it matter if Billy spilt these cookies or not?
4729740	4730740	Like I don't know.
4730740	4734620	It just kind of like blows your mind and then, and then, and then Price is Right comes on
4734620	4737540	and you're like, what?
4737540	4743420	Price is Right is the most important drug experience that any young American can have.
4743420	4744420	Yeah.
4744420	4750940	When Drew first got it, I went, uh, uh, on his advice, he's like, go a little high.
4750940	4752580	Go to the audience and watch it high.
4752580	4759660	I, I went to, I went to a Price is Right taping so high, my mom knew I was high from watching
4759660	4769540	the Price is Right because I was in the audience right between two bidders that's like that
4769540	4770540	high.
4770540	4776260	But you were probably a standard deaf TV because this is my mom in the early 2000s, but you
4776260	4783900	were amazing cause I could still see how red my eyes were and how amazed I was at the savings.
4783900	4787260	I was sitting right next to you.
4787260	4790380	I was sitting with you and you were like kind of being like, I don't know if it was
4790380	4794380	weed paranoia or social anxiety, but on the way, like, yeah, like you looked a little
4794380	4795380	tense.
4795380	4797740	Like you, like, you weren't like, you didn't seem totally comfortable.
4797740	4798740	It's very high.
4798740	4799740	Yeah.
4799740	4801820	And then when people were like, when people were like yelling out and like, I'm like,
4801820	4802820	yeah, like, yeah.
4802820	4804820	Like, like, you know how much the thing costs and like, you're like, it's like, I don't
4804820	4805820	know.
4805820	4806820	Like a paper's yelling.
4806820	4810340	And like, I'm like, you can get in there like, like, oh, also I think I told you mistakenly
4810340	4814900	the reason why they sit the guests of Drew or whoever right behind the bidders row is
4814900	4817260	because it's actually not a great place to be seen on camera.
4817260	4818740	You must have been right in the hole between.
4818740	4819740	No, I was absent.
4819740	4820740	My mom showed me.
4820740	4821740	She put it on DVD.
4821740	4822740	I was like, whoops.
4822740	4829700	I was like, I looked like a Jim Brewer character, but I looked like the Jim Brewer character.
4829700	4833700	But at one point, Dan got swept into it and I think they were bidding on the on the on
4833700	4837020	the Plinko chips and they get to know how much this cost or how much that costs.
4837020	4840500	And Dan was like, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter, it's the kitty litter, it's
4840500	4841500	cheaper.
4841500	4849740	You started yelling at the kitty litter and then she won it and you were so happy.
4849740	4851540	It was really great.
4851540	4852940	It was really, really good.
4852940	4856900	It is like, like, like, especially through the lens of like now after the elections and
4856900	4860140	stuff and now the world that we could see that could happen, like, like, whereas before
4860140	4861900	it might have been like, you're a tool of the state.
4861900	4864660	If you're saying it's fun to sit and get high and watch prices, right.
4864660	4867200	But like, unless you're laughing at the capitalism.
4867200	4871380	But now I look back and I go, no, that was a wonderful guppy tank for capitalists.
4871380	4876460	It was like you could be 20 and get high and pretend to shop for the same shit.
4876460	4880220	Like you when you're when you're that age, you're like, you're you're about to go to
4880220	4883700	Target and and comparison shop plungers and stuff.
4883700	4887940	You're going to buy your first plunger and start thinking about what, oh, this plunger
4887940	4891460	is cheaper, but I might need more later.
4891460	4894260	And it's kind of exciting anyways.
4894260	4899660	But I went there high as a grown man and it was like tough when that fucking yodeling dude
4899660	4900660	came out.
4900820	4901820	Oh, man.
4901820	4905740	When Hans comes out, as I told you, because I said, like, we don't know what's going
4905740	4907940	to happen because you don't know what the games are going to be.
4907940	4912100	But I was like, we're praying that that cliffhanger comes out as a cliffhanger cliffhanger.
4912100	4913100	Yeah.
4913100	4914100	Yeah.
4914100	4917860	And when he came out, you and I, I think we embraced that as some fucking like that was
4917860	4919740	designed by like an S.S.
4919740	4926180	officer that was trying to exploit THC influence or something like this, an Alpine climber.
4926180	4928140	And I'll design the yodels.
4928140	4932620	And it's all designed to like freak you out if you're high.
4932620	4937180	But if you're watching a TV and it's like, because Bob Barker would go, let's, well,
4937180	4938860	you thought this, let's take a look.
4938860	4940140	And there'd be a pause.
4940140	4946860	And then this fucking puppet would go, you know, for no reason.
4946860	4949380	There was never any reason for any of the conceits.
4949380	4952940	It would just be like, let's go to moon of savings.
4952940	4957860	And it would only be guessing prices of shit, but there'd be craters fucking genius.
4957860	4962860	But the one that we went to, she like got the first two, like really short, like Hans
4962860	4964180	didn't do fucking anything.
4964180	4965180	He was still at base camp.
4965180	4970020	And then the second one went a little bit longer and she missed by a lot, but like stopped
4970020	4971020	about halfway up.
4971020	4974240	She's got, Hans had half the mountain to go with the final thing.
4974240	4980180	And she bid and it wasn't like the crowd kind of went, oh, I don't know about that.
4980180	4986020	And you know, just freaking out.
4986020	4989740	And he went right to the fucking last one and stopped on the very edge.
4989740	4992060	And it was, it was bedlam.
4992060	4997580	It was, it was, it's so loud in there because I got to host that for a little while.
4997580	5001260	I announced it like to come on down and shit and like you go home with nightmares in your
5001260	5002260	head.
5002260	5007060	Cause it's, it's, it's like, it's like the noise of a Beatles concert, but about a kitty
5007060	5009740	litter at Plunchers.
5009740	5013700	The most fucked up thing about going to a prices rate taping, the most fundamentally
5013700	5020580	fucked up thing is that you're sitting in chairs and your angle of view is so different
5020580	5024900	from the cameras that you, you have to go like this to remind yourself that there's
5024900	5028380	that linoleum with the seventies flowers on it.
5028380	5031020	But like, it's like, it's above your line of sight.
5031020	5034580	And the whole, it's like, that's, that's if only if you're sitting in the first couple
5034580	5037580	rows, like the stage is like, yeah, humble brag.
5037580	5038580	All right.
5038580	5042300	Well, speaking of getting really high, Spencer, you want to play some, uh, some D and D right
5042300	5043300	now?
5043300	5047020	Yeah.
5047020	5053260	And can you have some, can you have some recap lenience and because we say, say that again,
5053260	5055180	can you have some recap lenience?
5055180	5060700	Because we, I don't remember anything.
5060700	5061700	Jeff and I re-listened.
5061700	5062700	Yeah.
5062700	5068100	This is going to be the strictest recap all year.
5068100	5070660	We didn't do a whole lot, but it took us eight hours to do it.
5070660	5071660	Sorry.
5071660	5072660	It's going to be a pretty easy.
5072660	5073660	Right.
5073660	5074660	Right.
5074660	5075660	I got it.
5075660	5080140	You're going to have to drop and give me 30 while I do it because I'm being strict,
5080140	5082500	which is a quality of recaps.
5082500	5084980	All right.
5084980	5093820	Um, last time they met doctor, no, not a doctor, farmer Manil and, uh, diarrhea junior ingratiated
5093820	5099140	him with some carefully timed snacks, uh, with Manil on their side.
5099140	5106580	They spent a good 25 minutes haggling over the price of cow carcasses and then eventually
5106580	5109700	settled on, I think two gold apiece.
5109700	5110700	I don't know.
5110700	5115900	It was a bad deal, but it was good for the farmer.
5115900	5121700	You guys, you made a costume of the cows and went out to be bait towards a creature that
5121700	5126740	seemed to be attacking at the cows and eating them or killing them.
5126740	5134780	And then it came and you guys, uh, made a noise, I think, and scared it off and yelled
5134780	5138140	and it was going off away towards a church and we were in the church.
5138140	5141020	We were in hot pursuit of this robed flying figure.
5141020	5142020	Hot pursuit.
5142020	5143020	Now.
5143020	5144020	Okay.
5144020	5145020	All right.
5145020	5153300	So it's evening time you're headed, you're, you're, I mean, you're, you're facing the
5153300	5157900	direction that the creature kind of took off in, which is again, towards, towards the
5157900	5161140	priory, the church.
5161140	5164940	And uh, yeah, it, it, it didn't make too much noise or anything.
5164940	5167500	You basically only heard its footsteps.
5167500	5171060	So we know the direction it went, we're running after it.
5171060	5175660	We can still kind of see it even though it's dark out and uh, I say we run as fast as we
5175660	5180340	can and not slow ourselves down by dwelling in the fact that you kind of, he was like
5180340	5185460	30 feet away from when you sprung your attack.
5185460	5188460	I won't, I won't explain my reasoning until later.
5188460	5189460	Okay.
5189460	5190460	Okay.
5190460	5191460	That's fine.
5191460	5192460	Yeah.
5192460	5193900	Told, told you to wait, told you to wait for it.
5193900	5195980	I just had that feeling.
5195980	5199900	I just felt like we were going to wait and wait and wait and then it was going to go
5199900	5204340	away and then Spencer'd be like, what do you think happens if you wait that long?
5204340	5207100	And that's the thing is that that's the same thought I had that caused us to end up burning
5207100	5208580	down the poor family's house.
5208580	5211300	Like I, it's called metagaming, right?
5211300	5216460	I should, I'm not even trying to punish it, but I should be doing what I do in real life.
5216460	5222300	But the good news is even though it took us all day and some of the nights to get practice
5222300	5226700	looking like cows, we, we, we did find of a flying robed figure.
5226700	5228220	So that's a lead.
5228220	5231420	So let's, let's, let's, let's, yeah, let's ask us an elbows towards that figure.
5231420	5236580	We had that whole conversation like Hanna Barbera style backgrounds are the same.
5237580	5240340	Just keep passing the same burning door.
5240340	5241660	All right.
5241660	5243180	You make it back to the priory.
5243180	5245340	It's, it's that old stone building.
5245340	5246340	It's pretty old.
5246340	5249460	Once again, you see a, it seems to be boarded up.
5249460	5252460	It seems that it's more reinforced than it was before.
5252460	5256820	And sitting outside is a Patchens again, he's sleeping, it looks like patches.
5256820	5257820	Yeah.
5257820	5262900	He was the first guy at the kind of kind of weird faced dude that we met before Patchens
5262900	5268500	was a young church boy who was guarding the front exit when he was.
5268500	5272300	That's not the one that Carlos threw the water on, right?
5272300	5274900	No, that was the prior.
5274900	5279260	That's the episode that we did in a tent at Chris Hardwick's cult.
5279260	5281620	The best one.
5281620	5283020	That was a crazy place, huh?
5283020	5284020	That was.
5284020	5285020	Whatever.
5285020	5286020	All right.
5286020	5289220	So are we up, are we, are we at Patchens right now?
5289220	5290220	Well, yeah.
5290220	5292620	Let's say you're in the clearing outside of the church.
5292620	5295540	I'll put you at 20 feet off, but he's asleep in a chair.
5295540	5297460	But we lost sight of the creature.
5297460	5298460	Yeah.
5298460	5301380	It took, it was really fast.
5301380	5304820	Like you were running in the direction it went, but it disappeared pretty quick.
5304820	5306780	But in the direction of the priory.
5306780	5307780	Right.
5307780	5310340	Which is one of the only buildings in that direction in town.
5310340	5311340	Yeah.
5311340	5312340	Okay.
5312340	5314380	I go up and I rouse Patchens out of his sleep.
5314380	5315380	All right.
5315380	5316380	You do that.
5316380	5317380	He wakes up.
5317380	5318380	Hey, what's up?
5318380	5319380	You guys.
5319380	5323700	We're in hot pursuit of a rogue flying figure.
5323700	5326540	We have reason to believe he's entered the priory.
5326540	5327540	So we need access.
5327540	5328540	We need to get in.
5328540	5329660	I can't get in right now.
5329660	5334740	They wanted me to guard this place and they kind of just boarded it up inside with me
5334740	5335740	outside.
5335740	5340740	When they told you to guard it, what did they tell you to do if anyone attacked the place
5340740	5345180	or if you had to give them any news of an impending attack?
5345180	5347740	Just not to let anyone in and that we were under attack.
5347740	5351540	So they sentenced you to death, really.
5351540	5354700	I feel like I should be understanding what you're saying, but I don't.
5354700	5357500	We're saying if an attack happens, can you get in yourself?
5357500	5358500	No, no.
5358500	5359500	Wait.
5359500	5360500	No.
5360500	5362540	So you've been left out here to die.
5362540	5365180	Well, no, I'm guarding.
5365180	5368380	I mean, in a way guard duty is always being left out to die somewhere.
5368380	5370140	No, that's not true at all.
5370140	5376660	A guard duty usually by default would be someone that person would have egress, ingress.
5376660	5378380	It could be guarding from the inside.
5378380	5379380	No, I'm not.
5379380	5380900	I'm not super thrilled about this.
5380900	5381900	I'm on your side.
5381900	5384300	I mean, I'm locked out of the church.
5384300	5387860	What is the what's the prior's name again?
5387860	5388860	That's a great name.
5388860	5389860	Berthold Abernathy.
5389860	5390860	Was it that?
5390860	5391860	Erkle?
5391860	5392860	Father Abernathy.
5392860	5393860	Berthold.
5393860	5394860	Father Erkle Abernathy.
5394860	5396420	No, Berthold or Berthold.
5396420	5398100	Can I tell you something, Patches?
5398100	5399100	Yeah.
5399100	5400100	Yeah.
5400100	5406780	More management, which is a lower rung of a church we represent.
5406780	5408180	Someone in there is spooky.
5408180	5410180	Yeah, probably.
5410180	5411340	Something ain't right.
5411340	5412340	And we the good guys.
5412340	5414900	I don't mean to get urban on you.
5414900	5416060	All right.
5416060	5421900	But I'm saying to you, like, if you were our ally and told us how to get in there to investigate
5421900	5429980	because we just followed a cattle mutilating floating man right to this spot.
5430980	5431980	He's wearing a robe.
5431980	5432980	I didn't see that.
5432980	5433980	Of course you didn't see it.
5433980	5434980	You were sleeping.
5434980	5435980	Oh, right.
5435980	5436980	Right.
5436980	5437980	Good point.
5437980	5438980	Well, yeah.
5438980	5439980	No, let's cut.
5439980	5440980	Well, the door is fucked up.
5440980	5441980	I mean, we can break it down.
5441980	5442980	I'll break it down.
5442980	5444980	Now, there's going to be a quieter way in, Patches.
5444980	5445980	Can we go back?
5445980	5446980	Can we go back?
5446980	5449820	You seem pretty proud of your guard duty status.
5449820	5451220	You were asleep when we got here.
5451220	5455260	So get off your I'm not, you know, I'm not good at my job.
5455260	5456580	I'm just trying to help.
5456580	5457580	Okay.
5457580	5459220	Well, you know, you want to you want to really do something good?
5459420	5460420	Want to make up for that?
5460920	5463120	Work with work with the A team over here.
5463120	5464920	I will never judge you.
5464920	5465920	What are you doing?
5468220	5469920	I thought I was already on your side.
5469920	5470920	Yeah.
5470920	5471920	Yeah.
5472920	5476220	You know, what I like about you Patches is you're kind of stealthy.
5476220	5480220	You were stealthy about your guarding and you're also you know, all the quiet ways
5480220	5482920	to get into the yeah, that that rogue figure probably thought you were just
5482920	5485220	another corpse out in this wasteland.
5485220	5485920	That was that was good.
5485920	5486820	I was smart of you.
5486820	5487920	Like where are the sewers?
5487920	5495720	Where's the where are the the the the underage girl shoots?
5496920	5500120	Huh things you'd expect in an organized religion building.
5502020	5503220	Well, we don't have those.
5504520	5505420	Impressive.
5508720	5511920	Can you can you call out to Father Abernathy?
5512420	5512720	Yeah.
5512720	5513320	Yeah, sure.
5514520	5515520	No, wait, wait, wait.
5516520	5518020	We won't we won't end.
5518020	5518520	Don't we?
5519120	5522220	Yeah, but we could I mean, you should you should lay the door on fire.
5522220	5523020	That's your move.
5523020	5524020	It's your signature move.
5524020	5527720	Father Abernathy Father Abernathy.
5528320	5530020	I say she's lighted on fire.
5530720	5532120	Let's give them a minute.
5532220	5533520	It's a big Priory.
5534320	5535120	Nothing happens.
5535120	5538220	You wait, let's say three minutes or less if you choose to.
5538220	5544820	I just think you guys I think that the odds of it being someone inside the Priory
5545320	5551820	and the odds therefore of it being a church official are high making this a sensitive mission.
5551820	5552620	Stealth operation.
5552620	5557020	Less of a hack and slash more of a infiltrate and celebrate.
5559920	5563620	All right, so I exam.
5564620	5568120	Should we all kind of split up or examine the the the church?
5568220	5569120	Well patches here.
5569120	5571920	I think is holding out on us and ways to get into the Priory.
5571920	5574020	I think I think there's milk shoots.
5574020	5575220	I think there's mail drops.
5575220	5576420	Okay, there's chimneys.
5576420	5577720	Well, you need to talk.
5577820	5579120	Yeah, I would agree.
5580720	5588120	Well, yeah, we could go in the inside this there's there's multiple buildings that kind of form a perimeter perimeter around the inner yard,
5588120	5591320	but then the inner yards got smaller doors.
5591320	5592920	They're just kind of people doors.
5592920	5594920	They're not they're not so public.
5594920	5597120	You know, they're probably less reinforced.
5597120	5597820	Who knows?
5598220	5599020	Let's do that.
5600320	5600720	Patches.
5600720	5602920	Who's the weirdest of your bosses?
5602920	5607320	Like the one who's been behaving recently the most strangely the father.
5607320	5609020	He's been super suspicious.
5609020	5610020	I mean the prior.
5610320	5611420	He's also the father.
5612320	5613520	There's a lot of redundant church.
5613520	5616320	Was he the father prior to being the prior?
5617320	5619020	Yeah, yeah, we'll be right back.
5623220	5624420	Well, that goes both ways.
5624420	5628720	I mean if you were the father of a infiltrated church, you'd be paranoid.
5629520	5631320	But it also if you were a Dracula.
5632320	5634020	You'd be like, does anyone know?
5634020	5634520	All right.
5635020	5635520	All right.
5636020	5641120	Patches lead us into the perimeter buildings.
5641120	5641520	All right.
5641520	5648420	He takes you around the right side of the building into there's kind of a narrow narrow passageway.
5648420	5654220	It's it's let's say it's three feet wide and it's covered in like what do you call it?
5654420	5660720	There's like barrels and all sorts of thing like like storage items boxes that are that are holding kind of
5661220	5670120	stuff for horses and yard work, but it's all just piled in kind of precariously and then over it is a big iron net that's made out of iron chain links.
5670120	5675720	So it all looks kind of noisy, but there is you know, you could go through it.
5675720	5679620	It'll just be loud or you got to be real careful or something.
5680320	5684720	So it's like a it's like an attached garage with a lot of loud stuff in it.
5684720	5687120	It's like a side yard with a lot of loud stuff in it.
5688020	5690220	Patches, is there a quieter way to get in here?
5690220	5693520	Do we do we have to go be a one man band as we walk in here?
5695620	5703820	No, we the cellar access is on the inside, but yeah, we go in another door, but most of these doors are boarded up.
5706520	5706920	Let's see.
5706920	5708420	I'm pretty I'm pretty stealthy.
5708420	5710920	My spell load out was I did offensive.
5710920	5712220	Do you really believe so?
5712220	5712920	The third one.
5713320	5714420	I'm not very stealthy.
5715320	5718620	Yeah, I don't really have any magic that can help us.
5719520	5720220	I mean, I'm a gnome.
5720220	5726820	Is there other is it easy for me because I'm smaller to kind of like shimmy through this noisy box and chain and you are smaller.
5726820	5727220	Yeah.
5728120	5728620	All right.
5728920	5730420	It's not too much easier guys.
5730420	5734220	Do you want to try some of these boarded doors first try to pry these off or do you want to go?
5734220	5736020	I guess one more question patches.
5736420	5745320	Is there are there any functions coming up where I mean these doors are boarded up like these guys are relegated to they're just going to stay in there and never come out.
5745320	5748220	Are they are there any Town Hall meetings coming up where?
5749120	5749920	Hmm.
5750320	5754220	Well, there was a big ceremony, but I don't know anything about that.
5754520	5757920	Tell us about the ceremony.
5757920	5759620	I don't know anything about that.
5759720	5762020	They just said said it needed to be guarded.
5762520	5762820	Oh, yeah.
5762820	5764520	I mean the ceremony happened in there.
5764720	5765620	I don't know man.
5765720	5769820	I think you don't know if the ceremony happened in the I don't think it's happened yet.
5770320	5772120	There's a ceremony about to happen.
5772120	5773020	I don't know man.
5773020	5774220	They don't tell me nothing.
5774320	5775020	This guy.
5775520	5777820	They locked me like that door on fire.
5777820	5779020	We got to just get in there.
5779020	5781020	Yeah, I and a fire isn't loud.
5781020	5783220	I fire isn't loud.
5783220	5783720	What do you wait?
5783720	5784920	What are you suggesting?
5785020	5788420	I don't know if you like that door on fire and they're like in the base.
5788420	5790220	Don't like we can't like that.
5790220	5792720	We tried lighting doors on fire.
5792720	5794020	It's mostly it got us here.
5794020	5801220	I have the feeling we don't know if here is better than where we were before we started lighting doors on fire.
5801320	5802420	What I'm an optimist.
5802420	5804420	Why don't we just stay in this passageway?
5804420	5806120	It's dressed up like cows again and wait.
5806120	5806420	All right.
5806420	5806820	All right.
5807020	5809920	Let's let's see healthy healthy.
5810120	5811820	I have a very healthy but real quick.
5811820	5816620	I had this just boxes and chain kind of situation is kind of a crude alarm system, right?
5816820	5818520	Well, I mean, it's a de facto one.
5818520	5819420	Yeah, de facto.
5819420	5821920	It's like in a video game where but I'm metagaming.
5822720	5824020	Right, but that's accurate.
5825220	5825420	Okay.
5825420	5827920	I mean, it's like a it's like a tough place to crawl through.
5827920	5829620	You're going to have to impress us like Catherine.
5829620	5836020	I don't have you're going to have to do your little booty move through the I have a lot of dexterity.
5836020	5836820	Not a lot of stealth.
5836820	5837920	Do you have acrobatics?
5838520	5842020	You know, oh, all right.
5842020	5847220	Well, dexterity is well, let's I have some stealth for what's your dexterity?
5849220	5849920	Talk left.
5851020	5852120	15.
5852120	5856320	I got to teach you how to read that 15 patches.
5856320	5858520	He's more dexterous than me and he's more stealthy than me.
5858520	5858620	Yeah.
5858620	5859320	No, he should go.
5859320	5859620	Yeah.
5860320	5861820	What what do you think I should do?
5861820	5865820	I think you start try to get through and like just see what you see on the opposite side of this.
5865820	5866620	Debris here.
5866620	5866920	All right.
5866920	5870220	I want to and then you can toss us a truss as a rope.
5871020	5874620	It's a it's a from an upstairs window.
5874620	5875120	I bet.
5875620	5877220	Oh, okay.
5878620	5887320	I want to dexterously and stealthily make my way across the room past all the loud metal stuff.
5887420	5889820	You said your dexterity was 15, right?
5890220	5891620	Yeah, it's a roll of dice.
5891620	5895020	15 plus anything or just plus to 17.
5895620	5897720	The roll of dice will be on my phone.
5899420	5900620	You're not just being aloof.
5900920	5904820	No, John Favreau needs a GM and you're like, dude.
5906620	5907620	All right, you successfully.
5907620	5909020	Yeah, no, I left my dice somewhere.
5909020	5909420	Sorry.
5909820	5914420	You successfully sneak through the passageway and make it to the other side.
5914420	5919520	You're in a large kind of inner inner sanctum kind of inner inner yard area.
5920520	5923020	It's a large inner sanctum yard area.
5925220	5927620	What else do you find out?
5927820	5931720	There's a place where you can throw us a rope that we can climb up.
5932620	5934320	It's a Spencer.
5934320	5935320	I want to cross right.
5935320	5936220	I didn't go up.
5936320	5937320	No, you're right now.
5937320	5938420	You're just across.
5938420	5941020	Yeah, how far away is he from us right now?
5942220	5942920	20 feet.
5942920	5943820	Okay, so he's right by us.
5944120	5946120	Yeah, it's just like a side yard.
5946120	5947820	Okay, you want to try it too?
5947820	5952220	Should we did it look easy or is there a is there a cellar door nearby?
5953820	5954820	Not that you can see.
5955720	5956320	Do you see it?
5956320	5958420	Do you see any any other doors over there?
5958420	5962920	Do you look around look around to examine your surrounds always secret stuff.
5962920	5963220	All right.
5963220	5963620	All right.
5965420	5969620	I walk around the perimeter and look for doors.
5970720	5972820	Okay around the perimeter you walk around the perimeter.
5972820	5975620	You see you see a door and a staircase.
5975720	5977420	Yep, that's all you see in the yard.
5977420	5982320	There's two two horses that are tied up and they look great.
5982320	5983720	Look real nice horses.
5983720	5986020	The nicest horses you've seen several days.
5986820	5989020	You guys they're the nicest horses.
5989020	5991520	I've ever seen you stay focused.
5991520	5993420	You don't know you don't understand.
5993420	5995620	We have to let we have to take these horses with us.
5995620	6000620	If we can hear you people inside can hear you.
6001020	6003320	You can't you don't have a walkie-talkie.
6003320	6006120	Whatever that will end up being they're beautiful.
6006220	6008820	I can't hear you because you're being quiet.

6272620	6274820	I'm picturing us like we climbed up something.
6274820	6277120	Yeah, you're on top of the kitchen because he went up the
6277120	6277620	stairs.
6277620	6281620	Yeah, so the building is like a big square with a big square
6281620	6282320	in the middle of it.
6282320	6285420	So you're kind of on the peripheral square and you're looking
6285420	6288920	into the yard and the inside of it in the middle square.
6289220	6290920	There's horses down there.
6290920	6292520	Oh, those are beautiful horses.
6292520	6295020	Yeah, also across the yard.
6295020	6299320	You can see you can see like a what do you it looks like an
6299320	6300020	like an Abbey.
6300020	6300320	I don't know.
6300320	6302420	It looks like a fucking mission building, you know, those
6302420	6305520	long kind of mission and in the window, you can see Steve
6305520	6308720	opens the door and he's like he's he's walking into one of
6308720	6310720	these bedrooms and you can kind of see him.
6310820	6312220	You don't you don't really see too.
6312220	6313420	Well, you just see him over there.
6313520	6315920	Okay, he's walking one of the doors.
6316520	6317420	Let's go.
6317420	6319920	Can we can we walk around on the rooftops all the way around
6319920	6320620	this to where he is?
6320820	6324120	Yeah, but it'll and you'll end up on top of his roof on top
6324120	6327520	of the roof that he's under so you'll be on top of him.
6327820	6330620	But is there access through that roof like like to that
6330620	6331820	staircase or anything like that?
6331820	6333020	Who could we get to the staircase?
6333020	6335620	You'd have to climb back down on the inside of the yard
6335620	6336720	kind of okay, right?
6336920	6338720	Well, he saw the horses and walk past the horses.
6338720	6341020	I said we just we just get in there and everyone to sleep.
6341520	6343520	Let's be quiet or do you want to go rooftop?
6343620	6345420	Wait, I'm sorry.
6347320	6350720	We're kind of like walking the guard wall around a courtyard
6350720	6352020	right right and within the courtyard.
6352020	6352720	There's an Abbey.
6352720	6355220	Yeah, and the Abbey is now where we will know actually the
6355220	6358820	buildings are like the courtyard they like or the buildings
6358820	6362320	form the guard wall like all these buildings form a perimeter
6362320	6364820	but the buildings themselves and we just go to the roof of
6364820	6366920	the building that we saw diarrhea.
6366920	6371420	Okay, and I'm like and it seems to me like at least all the
6371420	6371920	video games.
6371920	6374620	I play that's the you know, may as well do that.
6374720	6375920	Okay, I regather my rope.
6376220	6378020	Okay, you get it.
6378020	6380520	Okay, you think you think it's quieter to walk on people's
6380520	6383120	roofs while they're sleeping or just to across the corner.
6383120	6385720	No, I do not know when you put it to me that way.
6385720	6389820	I do not think that all right, I keep my rope tied to the
6389820	6392420	gargoyle and leave it there in case we need to get out that
6392420	6392620	way.
6392620	6393920	I'm going to leave that rope there.
6395120	6397220	We're going to climb down into the into the courtyard now.
6397320	6399120	Okay, down in the courtyard.
6399120	6400820	Yeah, pass the horses into the Abbey.
6400820	6402420	Yeah, but I have my ropes gonna have to stay there because
6402420	6403820	there's no one to get the rope off.
6404220	6405720	Right, right.
6405720	6406020	Yeah.

6743020	6745520	It's like there's two men a game for a second.
6745520	6747920	That's like we saw Ferraris in the parking lot with license
6747920	6748420	plates.

6749020	6749620	You're right.

6750520	6751820	That's a fucking clue.
6752420	6754220	Those horses are too fancy.
6755120	6757120	We got to find Patchens.
6757220	6758220	Hey Stupens.
6758220	6758920	What's up?

6764820	6765320	They're here.
6765320	6766520	These are the guest quarters.
6767620	6770620	Is this guy in the room that we were just in?
6770620	6771620	Is that one of the guests?
6771720	6772420	No, no.
6772420	6773520	Do you know where they're sleeping?
6774120	6775820	I don't I don't think we have any guests.
6775820	6777120	How nice are their chests?
6777520	6778720	Not that kind of chest.
6778720	6780920	The one you could open and there's toys inside.
6784220	6786620	It would be in the there's no I don't think there's any guests
6786620	6787120	there.
6787520	6790020	You just think he doesn't think there's any guest.
6790220	6791420	Where's a secret guest?
6791420	6793120	Secret guest is what we're hearing.
6793420	6794420	Where is the library?
6795020	6797720	It's a it's the opposite.
6797720	6798520	It's behind us.
6798520	6799320	It's the opposite way.
6799320	6800420	We have to split up.
6801620	6807020	One of us has to go up to the head prior prior tours bedroom.
6807120	6811220	Yeah, and make sure he doesn't have signs of dew moisture on
6811220	6811720	his feet.
6811720	6812220	Right.
6812520	6817620	I'll go to the library for some reason because the library is
6817620	6820320	where the where the prior sleep is his bedrooms in there.
6820320	6821120	It's near the library.
6821120	6822120	It's in the library.
6822320	6824320	Is there is there an underground like kind of like like a
6824320	6826820	dungeon II kind of like keep or hold here?
6828420	6829820	Yeah, that's a yes.
6830420	6834020	No, not that I know of can I go new here?
6834020	6837120	Is it possible for me to get inside the the church temple
6837120	6837720	proper?
6838020	6838320	Yeah.
6838320	6842120	Yeah, that other door from the yard is maybe the best option.
6842420	6843720	Where's that event happening?
6844120	6845720	That ceremony the ceremony.
6845720	6848120	I don't know probably somewhere in the church that they boarded
6848120	6848320	up.
6848420	6851720	I'll go in like in the non-existed cellar door on fire.
6851720	6853220	Why do you want us to split up right now?
6853820	6858020	Because we've thrown out like nine places to go and I I think
6858020	6858920	somebody should go down.
6858920	6862020	I'm not going to see who I think it should be but someone
6862020	6864220	should go examine those horses and see if there's any like
6864220	6867220	identifying like, you know, like saddlebag.
6867220	6868020	I'll do it.
6869620	6870920	Let me examine those horses.
6871920	6874520	And you're going to check on the prior to the church.
6874520	6876520	You're going to go to the library and check out on that.
6876620	6877320	Oh, okay.
6877620	6879420	Do you want to you take the church?
6879420	6882720	Wait, the church the church is the church, right?
6882720	6884620	The library is the different place and that's where the
6884620	6885420	prior sleeps.
6885520	6888820	If you're stealth here, you should the sleeping prior.
6888820	6889520	You should go check.
6889520	6890520	I'll take sleeping prior.
