0	5000	Make some noise for yourself. You look so goddamn good tonight.
7000	9000	How do you feel?
10000	15000	Welcome to the first inaugural show here. We're so fucking happy to be here.
15000	19000	This session of Harmontown is now in full effect.
19000	23000	Welcome to the stage, Spencer Crittenden.
31000	36000	The mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
38000	40000	Show him some love.
40000	41000	Thank you.
41000	46000	I am Brandon Johnson. I will be guest controlling for the lovely Jeff Davis.
46000	49000	I'm nervous. I don't want to blow it down.
51000	54000	Big jerk shoes. He wasn't here for the premiere.
54000	61000	He knew this was coming for months and he's out there fucking Ryan Stiles or whatever.
61000	65000	I thought he was on the BET Kings of Comedy Tour.
65000	69000	I don't want to start on a sour note.
69000	72000	I don't want to start on a more sour note than starting without music.
72000	75000	I'm sorry about that. That was a little awkward.
75000	78000	It was all quiet. It was like church.
78000	80000	That's why I wore this outfit.
80000	83000	We're going to be working out some kinks.
83000	85000	And then we're going to be bringing out the kinks.
85000	88000	What? Big duh.
89000	95000	Not to start off on a sour note, but we were waiting.
95000	98000	We kept waiting to play a new...
101000	104000	Why do that at Meltdown?
104000	106000	Why would we do that at Meltdown?
106000	108000	Wait until the big day.
108000	111000	All these people have such ideas.
111000	113000	I forgot. I got a show for a month or whatever.
113000	116000	He's just gone. It's just the worst.
118000	122000	That's what Burbank's about. It's about sadness.
126000	129000	We're just underneath five freeways.
129000	133000	Whose idea was it to move to this awful location?
133000	135000	We could go to Ikea.
136000	138000	It was my idea.
138000	141000	Hopefully the livestream experience is a little more friendly.
141000	143000	Oh, great. Thanks, Dan.
143000	146000	That's what we love, the people that pay to come see the show.
146000	149000	We want to make sure that the livestream is...
149000	151000	There was a guy that tweeted...
151000	155000	Not that I want to grease the stinky wheels,
155000	159000	but there was a guy that tweeted in response to us tweeting out
159000	161000	that we were going to be here.
161000	163000	I can't remember what his wording was.
164000	168000	Following the Cookie Cutter podcast track, I see.
170000	171000	What?
171000	175000	Co-opt your animation studio's extra building
175000	178000	for a location to shoot it out of.
178000	183000	The old Cookie Cutter path in podcasting.
183000	185000	No, what did he say? It was something like that.
185000	187000	That guy's so grumpy.
187000	189000	How do you get that grumpy?
190000	195000	Where did he get the impression of the Cookie Cutter podcast path?
195000	197000	How can a path be Cookie Cutter?
199000	201000	It sounds delicious.
202000	206000	I'll be calling out some notes because we have to live test the venue and stuff.
206000	209000	First things first, I don't know if this is going to work.
209000	211000	This is blinding me.
211000	214000	I guess there's always going to be lights.
214000	216000	The second thing is that...
216000	218000	Yes, there's always going to be lights.
219000	222000	Let's not get too cocky. There might not always be lights.
230000	233000	The CNN is blowing through. How about that weather?
233000	236000	What kind of podcast is this? How about the weather?
236000	239000	What is he looking at? What's he looking at on his phone?
239000	243000	Is his agent calling? Is he telling him great job?
243000	245000	Why is he being self-deprecating?
245000	249000	He moved his podcast here. He's the Cookie Cutter podcaster.
249000	255000	This is weird to say, but I feel more at risk of being shot here than the last venue.
256000	257000	I don't know what that is.
257000	260000	That's so racist. I'm so sorry about that.
262000	264000	You're the one that bought a gun.
266000	268000	That's how racist it is.
268000	271000	We have to move all the way to Burbank to find out Spencer's racist.
272000	274000	Just clearer shots.
274000	280000	I don't know. Maybe it's just that thinking that it's a place of nerd-dumb puts you at ease or something.
280000	282000	I don't know, but just... Oh, man.
282000	285000	It feels more like a town hall now.
285000	287000	Somebody could walk up the middle aisle and say,
287000	289000	Get your hand out of my pocket!
293000	296000	I really will be racist and ask you, do you know what that was about?
296000	297000	What did that mean?
297000	305000	That is the thing that the FBI agent yelled to cause a distraction in the back of the hall when Malcolm X was speaking.
305000	308000	It was actually confirmed that the guy...
308000	313000	I saw Malcolm X in the movie and all I saw was a guy just started yelling that out and didn't say,
313000	315000	This is an FBI agent or anything.
315000	318000	Maybe it was Minecrafting during the movie.
319000	330000	I'm continuing to be racist by going to you as if you're some kind of Malcolm X movie expert.
330000	333000	You watched it nine times. Come on.
333000	335000	This was your Ghostbusters.
335000	337000	Malcolm X was my uncle.
338000	340000	This is your Gremlins too.
340000	342000	This was your Ghostbusters.
343000	349000	I think I probably watched it once back when it was on a pay-per-view.
349000	352000	I found myself very confused by that scene.
352000	358000	It smacked of, there must have been mass chaos and there's accounts of people saying different stuff.
358000	363000	Spike Lee was just being faithful to the confusion because it was just a confusing thing.
363000	366000	It was organized confusion.
366000	371000	So that everyone would be diverted to the guys who were arguing and then no one would see the shooters.
371000	374000	But they grabbed that guy that said,
374000	376000	God damn, Madam South February.
379000	382000	This wasn't on my list of things to talk about anyway.
386000	390000	This election has really made me aware of how racist I am.
390000	394000	I gave you some black nerd shit in keeping.
394000	398000	That's one of those weird facts that black nerds know.
401000	408000	What the fuck is this thing?
413000	417000	So for those of you just listening, oh my God.
422000	425000	Don't let the suit fool you.
426000	432000	For those of you only listening and not looking, again, you can look for $5 a month.
432000	436000	But also I'm not going to turn my back on you if you're just listening.
436000	445000	So I'll tell you, there's a plastic wrapped, a polka dot plastic wrapped six foot tall human sized gift on the stage.
445000	449000	That was brought by, does anyone want to identify themselves as the gift bringer?
449000	454000	Okay, you're both the gift, you're dual gift bringers.
454000	456000	What are your names? Can I ask?
456000	457000	I'm Spencer.
457000	461000	Fuck. Spencer and Zoe. This sucks.
464000	466000	Do you want me to just open it up here? Is that okay?
466000	469000	Or do you want me to open it privately or do you want to help me open it?
469000	470000	Okay.
470000	473000	There's a ribbon at the top so you can just unloose it. You don't need the knife.
473000	475000	Okay.
475000	479000	All right. Don't need knives, Brandon.
480000	483000	You don't need the knife.
493000	496000	There's a second.
496000	499000	Oh, shit.
499000	502000	There's a mannequin.
502000	506000	It's missing an R2O.
507000	512000	It's got paper flowers over its privates.
512000	516000	And it's wearing pantyhose.
516000	520000	Brandon just cocked the chest right.
520000	523000	No shoes. That's good.
526000	529000	They know what I like. She's not wearing high heels.
529000	533000	Because I like comfortable women. I don't know if you know that about that.
533000	535000	No high heels?
535000	538000	I love sleepy, comfortable women.
538000	542000	I like ugg boots or nice flats.
542000	545000	And then, of course, tights or stockings.
545000	549000	Women are very comfortable in those.
549000	553000	Well, now we have this.
553000	556000	Thank you, Zoe and Spencer.
556000	559000	This is so thoughtful and probably a great deal of work.
559000	562000	You're giving me more.
566000	569000	Thank you. Okay.
569000	573000	There's a hosiery to go with it.
573000	576000	It's a dream girl brand.
576000	580000	One size fits most, it says at the bottom.
580000	584000	Yeah. All right. Well, this is making me...
587000	590000	Thank you and good night.
590000	594000	Thank you so much. You're such thoughtful people.
595000	597000	I got to say, we did our last show.
597000	600000	And so the people brought gifts to that as well.
600000	603000	And one of the people brought a...
603000	605000	It was like a slightly scaled down.
605000	607000	It wasn't the same size as in the Christmas story.
607000	612000	But it was like one of those... It was a replica leg lamp with the fishnet on it.
612000	617000	But he... This is like how you know you've really found your audience.
617000	620000	After doing a show for five years, he put a little pant leg over it
620000	623000	to not objectify it in public.
625000	630000	He had a little tasteful slack around it for public.
630000	633000	Which is, you know, because he didn't want to trigger people next to you.
633000	635000	He didn't want to like brandish it around.
635000	639000	Like, look at me, this is what I think your standard should be.
639000	641000	Trigger.
641000	645000	He put a little leg tarp on it.
645000	648000	I was going to say burka, but then I was like, no, then you'll get in trouble
648000	651000	because you don't know how to use that term properly.
651000	653000	You'll hurt somebody.
653000	655000	Has anybody watched that show, Patriot?
655000	657000	You guys watched that show on Amazon?
657000	659000	What do you mean, do you watch it in the present tense?
659000	661000	It's just a thing that just sits there on the internet.
661000	663000	That's how TV is now.
663000	667000	Has anybody gone and turned over that Amazon rock
667000	672000	and taken just whatever you want from underneath it?
672000	675000	It's appointment viewing.
675000	677000	But it's great.
677000	681000	I watched the whole show.
681000	682000	I really like it.
682000	684000	It's a bad podcast, but Patriot's great.
684000	686000	You should go watch it.
686000	688000	Well, we got some stuff.
688000	691000	This is the one thing I wanted to talk about.
691000	703000	And then I'll bring my guest up.
703000	705000	I know you're going to be like, some people are going to be like,
705000	707000	oh, what's the big deal?
707000	708000	Or maybe there's press here.
708000	709000	Maybe Variety came.
709000	710000	I don't know.
711000	713000	So what's my angle on this piece?
713000	716000	So Dan Harmon takes streaming to the mainstream or something.
716000	717000	I don't know.
717000	719000	But there's going to be judgment from each side.
719000	732000	But I just like, your boogers get like, I feel like 90% of my waking hours
732000	735000	are spent picking my nose now.
735000	739000	Have you found that you get more boogers as you get older?
739000	742000	And it's like an air filter.
742000	744000	It clogs faster.
744000	748000	And so you get to be like, oh, you spend 10 seconds when you're 6 years old.
748000	750000	You spend 10 seconds picking your nose.
750000	753000	And you're like, bummed out when you're done.
753000	755000	Why are you bummed out?
755000	757000	Because you're a kid and you love boogers.
757000	759000	And you're like, yay.
759000	762000	Oh, no, now I'm going to breathe clearly for another two days
762000	765000	until I get enough boogers to have fun with.
765000	767000	And then just cut to you.
768000	770000	You're like, twice a movie.
770000	771000	I'm like, more?
771000	773000	Like, like, like.
773000	776000	This is just awful.
776000	778000	Is that because you're growing more hair in your nose?
778000	779000	Boom.
779000	780000	Boom.
780000	781000	More hair.
781000	785000	And is that because your body knows that you're becoming more vulnerable to death?
785000	788000	And so it's just like, it's just throwing the cheapest solution at it,
788000	790000	just going like, just don't let anything in.
790000	795000	Get off my microbiotic lawn.
795000	798000	Your body becomes against you at a certain age.
798000	800000	And it makes us look fucking ridiculous.
800000	803000	It makes us the people we used to laugh at.
803000	804000	Yeah.
804000	806000	Remember when you were a kid and you were like, you were this high
806000	808000	so you could see up in the old people's noses.
808000	810000	And you were like, look at this old booger-nosed motherfucker
810000	812000	trying to give me advice.
812000	814000	Never going to be this motherfucker.
814000	817000	And then today.
817000	821000	Did I talk last time about that documentary,
821000	825000	the Texas University shooting, the sniper guy.
825000	827000	There's like a movie out.
827000	829000	Did I talk about that last time?
829000	830000	Yeah.
830000	832000	Well, this is related.
832000	834000	To boogers.
834000	835000	It's really cool.
835000	837000	I can't remember what it's called, but you should check it out.
837000	839000	I don't know where you can find it.
839000	842000	But again, just go flip some rocks over.
842000	843000	Google it.
843000	844000	Whatever.
844000	845000	It's just laying there.
845000	851000	And it's a kind of like second by second witness account,
851000	852000	multiple witnesses.
852000	856000	Everybody, survivors of this what was in the 70s,
856000	859000	the Texas University guy went up in the clock tower
859000	860000	and he just started.
860000	863000	He shot like 30 something people.
863000	864000	Many of them lived.
864000	865000	Many of them died.
865000	869000	And the ones that lived obviously are the ones telling the story.
869000	870000	But they did this thing.
870000	873000	They did this kind of like thing that almost made me turn it off
873000	876000	because it was like this kind of like waking life.
876000	877000	What's that movie called?
877000	880000	The rotoscopy like vectory kind of thing.
880000	884000	And thank you.
884000	887000	Our guest is champing at the bit to get up here
887000	893000	and he figured it out who the guest is.
893000	894000	And they're like, he's a guest?
894000	897000	Do you call him a guest now?
897000	899000	It's just like when Buddy Hackett was on Carson.
899000	901000	It was just like, okay, who can we get?
901000	902000	Who can we get?
902000	905000	Okay.
905000	910000	You are going to pay for that.
910000	915000	But the thing is, you realize as it goes,
915000	920000	and you should keep watching it because it just continually,
920000	925000	it gets more and more enthralling and heartbreaking
925000	927000	and terrifying and interesting.
927000	930000	And there's heroic stories and there's also people going.
930000	932000	And that's when I realized I was a coward,
932000	937000	which is I mean really just as uplifting and interesting to hear.
937000	943000	But all of the people were like the age they were during the incident.
943000	945000	And I realize it's because we're ageists.
945000	949000	Like they hired actors, like 25 year old actors,
949000	955000	and animated interviews so that they weren't necessarily just having
955000	957000	fake people on video.
957000	958000	So they kind of split the diff.
958000	961000	I think this is my assumption of why they were doing this artistically.
961000	966000	But it was like they're doing this rotoscopy thing of younger people
966000	970000	acting, reading the accounts of the people that have survived it.
970000	973000	And then they start cutting to the people toward the end
973000	976000	and revealing that those people are still alive and that this was their story.
976000	979000	And they're all of course 30, 40 years older.
979000	982000	And it really dawns and you're like, oh, now I see why they did that.
982000	985000	Because we don't like old people.
985000	989000	We don't believe that there's people that are,
989000	991000	I'm including myself among them at this point.
991000	994000	But it says like melting people like telling you like,
994000	996000	well, then this thing got really happened.
996000	999000	It was real bad.
999000	1003000	And you're just like, yeah, that's what you rock lords always say.
1003000	1006000	You're always referring to like how life was rocky.
1006000	1012000	Everything's made of granite and flinch.
1012000	1017000	Everyone looks like Michael Chiklis in an oven.
1017000	1020000	The ears are the same size as their head.
1020000	1024000	And the lobes are resting like epaulettes on their shoulder pads.
1024000	1033000	And just like their teeth are old baseballs signed by Mickey Rooney.
1033000	1037000	Mickey Mattel.
1037000	1039000	Which means they got that when they were very young.
1039000	1041000	And he was still a child star.
1041000	1044000	But it was really effective because they include the images of the old people.
1044000	1047000	And so it really brings you to the precipice of realizing that.
1047000	1051000	And then you're like, yeah, it seems like a dumb thing to have to remind yourself.
1051000	1054000	But 65-year-old people were once 25.
1054000	1057000	And they were probably pretty hot when they were.
1057000	1060000	And you probably therefore like really listened to everything they said.
1060000	1062000	Like, man, I want a soda pop.
1062000	1065000	And you're like, whoa, that's amazing, Brittany.
1065000	1069000	And then she's later just like, I want a soda pop.
1069000	1072000	And you're like, fuck you.
1072000	1073000	Piece of shit.
1073000	1074000	Get back in your hole, grandma.
1074000	1077000	Piece of unfuckable shit.
1077000	1080000	You offend me.
1080000	1081000	It's true.
1081000	1082000	And we really blame people.
1082000	1083000	We blame women.
1083000	1084000	We get pregnant.
1084000	1086000	We look at them as like, oh, you're glowing.
1086000	1088000	And then the stuff for them were like, you're pregnant.
1088000	1089000	But you can't work here.
1089000	1090000	Get out of here.
1090000	1091000	Go home.
1091000	1094000	No, you can't get paid while you're at home having a baby,
1094000	1097000	you fucking gross baby maker.
1098000	1100000	And then as we all get older, we're like, you old fuck.
1100000	1104000	You gross piece of shit.
1104000	1105000	We worship youth.
1105000	1107000	And when are you the youngest?
1107000	1111000	When you're fucking stupid, like, well, we're kind of like, we split the difference.
1111000	1113000	And we go like, oh, I love 25-year-olds.
1113000	1115000	But really, you know, you can tell from our culture.
1115000	1117000	We're like, yeah, but I really like a nice 19-year-old.
1117000	1118000	Oh, shit.
1118000	1121000	You know.
1121000	1123000	And it's like, you don't know nothing when you're that age.
1123000	1126000	And so those people have all the capitalistic power.
1126000	1127000	They were like, what do you think?
1127000	1129000	What do you think about the weather today?
1129000	1130000	It was brand new.
1130000	1131000	He's right.
1131000	1132000	He's right.
1132000	1135000	It's never happened this weather.
1135000	1138000	We used to have that respect for old people when we were cavemen
1138000	1141000	because they looked at melty people and they'd be like, dude, it's melting.
1141000	1145000	Like, do you know how many saber-toothed tigers he hasn't been bitten by?
1145000	1149000	Yeah, but you know, old people kind of got mean and sent us off to war.
1149000	1151000	So it changed the shit maybe.
1151000	1152000	Yeah.
1152000	1154000	Because when I see an old person, I'm like, you fucking did acid
1154000	1156000	and fucked up the country for us.
1156000	1158000	Yeah.
1158000	1159000	Yeah.
1159000	1160000	That's the generation.
1160000	1163000	It was the, yeah, there was the silent generation, the greatest generation
1163000	1165000	of the baby boomers.
1165000	1166000	Right.
1166000	1167000	Wah, wah.
1167000	1170000	Beetles and fake butter and AIDS.
1179000	1183000	That was a reference to Community and the Community Christmas episode
1183000	1184000	where they'd say it.
1184000	1189000	And I believe one of those things, Donald Glover, I helped out with that line.
1189000	1193000	He came up with fake butter and AIDS, I think.
1193000	1199000	Donald was, Donald was, he was really going places back then.
1199000	1203000	It's a shame to see these kids waste their future, you know.
1203000	1206000	I wish he would have stayed up for that stretch.
1206000	1207000	Just spelling out the wrong crowd.
1207000	1209000	A bunch of rappers and golden gold people.
1209000	1217000	You were going to regret this not moving to Yahoo with us?
1217000	1218000	Where are you going?
1218000	1219000	To rap.
1219000	1220000	Ha!
1220000	1221000	To rap.
1221000	1222000	Atlanta.
1222000	1225000	Who's ever heard of the place?
1225000	1228000	Go ahead, make your silly show.
1228000	1231000	Donald Glover.
1231000	1234000	I'll see you again, my friend.
1234000	1236000	Kicking on my door in the rain.
1236000	1240000	Please, one more season, sir.
1240000	1245000	Can we do it for Alta Vista?
1245000	1249000	Does crack to have a discretionary fund?
1249000	1254000	We could shoot it in your apartment.
1254000	1255000	Ha!
1255000	1256000	I don't know, Donald.
1256000	1260000	I'll think about it.
1260000	1261000	What am I looking at?
1261000	1262000	I'm not looking at anything.
1262000	1265000	I'm trying to find my notes.
1265000	1268000	I'm a little nervous.
1268000	1270000	Let's try out some of the technology.
1270000	1271000	Spencer, tell people.
1271000	1274000	Oh, let's bring up Rob Schwab.
1274000	1276000	Rob Schwab, ladies and gentlemen.
1276000	1279000	Rob Schwab.
1279000	1282000	He's got a backpack on him.
1282000	1289000	Careful, careful.
1289000	1295000	Oh, no.
1295000	1302000	Oh, my God.
1302000	1308000	Why is there a mirror under her?
1308000	1311000	It's like a mirror under her.
1311000	1317000	All right.
1317000	1320000	Will you talk to people for a second?
1320000	1322000	What are you going to do?
1322000	1325000	The backpacks are the only way we could power the show.
1325000	1327000	Right.
1327000	1336000	You want me to talk to people while you go backstage for a second?
1336000	1350000	No, I was just going to...
1350000	1354000	Oh, for people listening, we tried to clear the mannequin
1354000	1357000	and I ended up fondling the legs.
1357000	1358000	That's it.
1358000	1360000	That's it.
1360000	1363000	It's good to be here.
1363000	1368000	How are you?
1368000	1369000	Good, Brandon.
1369000	1370000	I'm nervous.
1370000	1371000	I'm nervous.
1371000	1372000	I'm happy to be here.
1372000	1374000	How was your week?
1374000	1375000	What?
1375000	1377000	I'm not doing good, guys.
1377000	1379000	You got a case of the Ds.
1379000	1381000	I got the Ds, man.
1381000	1382000	I don't know.
1382000	1385000	This writer strike is scaring me.
1385000	1387000	I mean, we were talking about it backstage.
1387000	1392000	That's going to suck, man, but it can't work.
1393000	1396000	Got to do it to stay solid.
1396000	1398000	This set up...
1398000	1402000	It's such a big stage, but it's just full of stuff.
1402000	1403000	We're going to figure it out.
1403000	1405000	Okay.
1405000	1406000	Good.
1406000	1414000	Thank God you brought the really comfortable chairs.
1414000	1415000	All right.
1415000	1417000	So we're going to do this in real time.
1417000	1425000	So somebody told me, how do I hook my thing up to the thing?
1425000	1434000	Can you use a deeper voice?
1434000	1437000	I'll shut you right up.
1437000	1438000	Okay.
1438000	1442000	Now I got to tell you, about an hour before the show,
1442000	1445000	our dimmer blew, so we can't dim the lights,
1445000	1454000	which might make it hard to view a projection.
1454000	1459000	How is dimmer?
1459000	1460000	All right.
1460000	1461000	So this is...
1461000	1463000	We're going to try it.
1463000	1465000	We're just trying it.
1465000	1467000	All right.
1467000	1470000	Oh, yeah.
1470000	1477000	Oh, shit.
1477000	1479000	This isn't the writer's room.
1479000	1480000	Come on.
1480000	1483000	This is my Minecraft world.
1483000	1485000	I'm playing a Skyblock mod pack.
1485000	1488000	Now, if you're listening to the free version of the podcast,
1488000	1494000	again, $5 a month, but also, you know, I'm not going to...
1494000	1496000	I just want to try out some of the visual stuff.
1496000	1498000	Get the gold.
1498000	1500000	Get the fucking gold.
1500000	1503000	I'm going to use my jet pack, so I want to show you guys one thing.
1503000	1505000	Get the fucking gold.
1505000	1506000	Spencer.
1506000	1508000	Now, it was just nighttime, and now it's daytime.
1508000	1510000	Can you explain what happened?
1510000	1512000	I right-clicked on the bed, and the sun came out.
1512000	1513000	Great.
1513000	1515000	All right, Spencer, look at my Wither farm.
1515000	1516000	Oh, yeah.
1516000	1518000	You were talking to Cody about this on Instagram.
1518000	1519000	Oh, that's right, yeah.
1519000	1523000	Okay, so these are refined storage constructors.
1523000	1527000	And then over here is a refined storage system,
1527000	1529000	and I have soul sand in there.
1529000	1531000	So soul sand is going to...
1531000	1533000	What happened?
1533000	1537000	I just feel my life just draining away.
1537000	1539000	That's the soul sand.
1543000	1545000	And then these are placers,
1545000	1547000	and they have little tiny wither skeleton skulls in them.
1547000	1548000	You know what?
1548000	1550000	This is too cool for you guys.
1550000	1553000	And so those things make a wither.
1553000	1555000	Those things make a wither if you play Minecraft,
1555000	1557000	then you know that when you get soul sand...
1557000	1558000	They love withers.
1558000	1559000	Don't encourage them.
1559000	1560000	You pour it into a tea formation.
1560000	1562000	If you stack up soul sand in this tea formation,
1562000	1564000	and then you place wither skeleton skulls on top,
1564000	1565000	it creates a wither,
1565000	1568000	which is the most dangerous creature in all of Minecraftia.
1568000	1570000	And it's called a wither.
1570000	1572000	And these are placers, so I can do it remotely.
1572000	1573000	The wither skeleton skulls are in here,
1573000	1576000	and this is all wither-proof obsidian block.
1576000	1577000	Wither-proof.
1577000	1578000	Make it do.
1578000	1580000	So then over here...
1580000	1581000	So I've switched.
1581000	1584000	It's a 10-second self-resetting lever.
1584000	1587000	It goes down to conduit here.
1589000	1592000	Do you want to explain the redstone logic that controls the self?
1592000	1595000	Just think of redstone as like electricity.
1595000	1597000	So this is redstone conduit.
1597000	1599000	So this lever is going to activate...
1599000	1601000	It's going to send energy down these things.
1601000	1602000	Down these wires.
1602000	1604000	And it's going to split to the left and the right.
1604000	1606000	On the left, it's going to go over here
1606000	1608000	and up to these placement things
1608000	1610000	that's going to place wither skeleton skulls
1610000	1612000	on top of the soul sand.
1612000	1614000	And then on the right,
1614000	1618000	this is going to make a force field over the top of this.
1618000	1620000	But it has to do it after the wither gets created
1620000	1623000	and falls down below the force field level.
1623000	1625000	So I used a mod called...
1625000	1626000	Of course.
1626000	1627000	Super...
1627000	1630000	Does anybody have another mannequin?
1632000	1633000	That they want to bring up at this point?
1633000	1635000	This is a small circuit I made.
1635000	1637000	There's a mod where you can make your own circuits
1637000	1638000	and they can get really elaborate.
1638000	1641000	But all this does is it sets a little tiny delay in there,
1641000	1642000	like a five second delay.
1642000	1643000	Tiny delay.
1643000	1645000	So with one lever pull,
1645000	1647000	what you're going to see happen...
1647000	1648000	I don't know if we have...
1648000	1649000	Wait, wait, wait.
1649000	1650000	Everyone in the audience,
1650000	1652000	we've got to say pull that lever.
1652000	1654000	Okay, okay, on three...
1654000	1655000	Wait, wait, wait.
1655000	1656000	If you want sound,
1656000	1658000	you've got to change the source in your audio.
1658000	1660000	Don't listen to them.
1660000	1661000	I'm just...
1661000	1662000	I was just so worried.
1662000	1664000	It'll only take about 10 minutes.
1664000	1666000	Okay, headphones decimator.
1666000	1667000	Do we have money for this?
1667000	1668000	Decimator?
1668000	1669000	Should be headphones.
1669000	1670000	Should be headphones.
1670000	1673000	Should we have enough time in the show?
1673000	1674000	The thing is,
1674000	1677000	it's hard to know what sounds like what.
1677000	1678000	I don't hear any sounds
1678000	1680000	these guys would be buying and mooing.
1680000	1681000	These are my animals.
1681000	1682000	These are...
1682000	1683000	That's a cow.
1683000	1685000	And even clucking, if I understand.
1685000	1688000	That's a chicken.
1688000	1689000	This stuff's...
1689000	1690000	You know, I probably...
1690000	1692000	This may be for another day.
1692000	1695000	These are generating cobble and flint and sand
1695000	1696000	and they're all...
1696000	1698000	They're each going through all the things
1698000	1700000	and then they pass it off to the next thing
1700000	1702000	and then, you know, there's just a lot of...
1702000	1703000	You get iron and stuff.
1703000	1704000	You guys don't...
1704000	1705000	You guys don't care, but...
1705000	1706000	I've got to pull the lever.
1706000	1708000	Okay, all right, so...
1708000	1710000	So here's...
1710000	1712000	Not yet!
1712000	1713000	What have I done?
1713000	1715000	Because you have to know what to look for,
1715000	1716000	because it doesn't look like much.
1716000	1717000	There's going to be a wither.
1717000	1720000	I have to tell you what's happening
1720000	1721000	so that you can be impressed.
1721000	1724000	But really, there's no...
1724000	1725000	There's no sound?
1725000	1726000	I don't...
1726000	1727000	I don't know.
1727000	1729000	Because the wither makes this crazy sound when it gets created.
1729000	1730000	All right, whatever.
1730000	1731000	I'm going to pull the lever.
1731000	1732000	Oh, yeah.
1732000	1733000	Did you try changing it to decimator?
1733000	1734000	He did try changing it to decimator.
1734000	1735000	Yeah.
1735000	1736000	I just have to be really careful because...
1736000	1737000	Because it'll explode.
1737000	1738000	Because it'll explode.
1738000	1739000	Or headphones?
1739000	1740000	Twelve percent.
1740000	1741000	Oh, try head...
1741000	1742000	Yeah.
1742000	1743000	Try headphones.
1743000	1744000	No, it's not going to be headphones.
1744000	1745000	Well, who cares?
1745000	1748000	Let's figure this out.
1752000	1753000	Oh, wait.
1753000	1754000	They can hear it.
1754000	1755000	They can hear it.
1755000	1757000	The cheers are outweighing the noise.
1757000	1758000	Don't change that much.
1758000	1759000	Yeah, no.
1759000	1760000	You got the noise.
1760000	1763000	Yeah, them's some cows, baby.
1763000	1765000	Oh, no.
1765000	1766000	I just...
1766000	1767000	Oh, no.
1767000	1768000	Testing the sound.
1768000	1769000	You lost the audience.
1769000	1771000	All right.
1771000	1772000	Okay.
1772000	1773000	So...
1773000	1774000	Mercy for animals.
1774000	1775000	The wither's going to get created.
1775000	1776000	It's going to go down...
1776000	1777000	It's going to fall down.
1777000	1779000	I'm going to go down here so you can watch it.
1779000	1780000	It's going to be in there.
1780000	1782000	And then...
1782000	1783000	Oh, shit.
1783000	1784000	Yeah, we're running out of power.
1785000	1786000	All right.
1786000	1787000	Let's do it.
1787000	1788000	Well, I just want to tell you, though, that...
1788000	1789000	When it...
1789000	1790000	It's going to...
1790000	1791000	It's also...
1791000	1793000	There's more down here because after the wither dies...
1793000	1794000	Shit.
1794000	1795000	Oh, shit.
1795000	1796000	Low battery.
1796000	1797000	Get my...
1797000	1798000	Get my power!
1808000	1810000	Let's get tribe up here.
1810000	1811000	Come on.
1811000	1813000	Let's get tribe up here.
1813000	1814000	Really.
1814000	1816000	Let's start the show.
1819000	1821000	Imagine being on, like, the Tonight Show.
1821000	1822000	All right.
1822000	1823000	Let's...
1823000	1825000	Here comes Alec Baldwin.
1825000	1826000	Sit down.
1826000	1828000	Talk about something completely different.
1828000	1829000	All right.
1829000	1830000	Play a game.
1830000	1831000	Ignore him.
1831000	1835000	I think it's time to pull that lever.
1836000	1837000	Okay.
1837000	1838000	See it?
1838000	1839000	They're creating the wither.
1839000	1840000	Okay.
1840000	1841000	Now he's falling down.
1841000	1842000	Now watch the force field.
1842000	1845000	You should have made a lighter color force field.
1845000	1846000	Wait.
1846000	1847000	He's down there.
1847000	1848000	He's blue colored.
1848000	1850000	Oh, he got Myrtle-ized.
1850000	1852000	And now it's going to...
1852000	1854000	The stuff he drops goes into this chest,
1854000	1857000	and then the chest has an import bus on it,
1857000	1858000	and then it goes to this computer,
1858000	1860000	and there it is, a delicious Nether Star.
1860000	1862000	He's got a Nether Star.
1862000	1864000	Whoo!
1868000	1869000	Okay.
1869000	1871000	And now there's another thing I wanted to share.
1871000	1873000	Not Minecraft really did.
1873000	1875000	That was actually really cool.
1875000	1877000	That was super cool.
1877000	1880000	You know, at first I thought it was boring,
1880000	1884000	but it really, really got me after a while.
1884000	1885000	You know?
1885000	1887000	I just really got engaged.
1887000	1889000	Dan?
1897000	1898000	Okay.
1898000	1900000	So if you're listening at home...
1900000	1901000	This is friendship.
1901000	1902000	This is called friendship.
1902000	1903000	It's a presentation.
1903000	1904000	It's a PowerPoint.
1904000	1905000	I just want to make sure...
1905000	1906000	If you're listening at home and you're like,
1906000	1909000	oh, so the podcast is always going to be so visual?
1909000	1910000	Now I'm never going to listen.
1910000	1912000	First of all, here's the smallest violin
1912000	1915000	for your lack of money.
1915000	1917000	You would be able to see it if you paid $5.
1917000	1918000	Yeah, $5.
1918000	1920000	But that's not why I'm doing it.
1920000	1922000	I'm not trying to blackmail you into...
1922000	1924000	I like that you cut your carrots and are poor
1924000	1926000	and want to listen to something.
1926000	1928000	I like eating your ears.
1929000	1931000	Shrob, you're going to feel bad for all the stuff
1931000	1933000	you said when you see this video.
1933000	1934000	Yeah.
1934000	1938000	So, Shrob, look, I know I...
1938000	1940000	I tried to whip together a PowerPoint up in the green room
1940000	1945000	and I took pictures of you
1945000	1947000	because I wanted to do a quick PowerPoint.
1947000	1950000	Friends is...
1950000	1953000	are friendly.
1953000	1954000	The R is for really friendly.
1954000	1955000	Whatever.
1955000	1956000	I bailed on that.
1956000	1960000	It's a chart that's a number of letters in Friends.
1960000	1961000	So I gave up.
1961000	1964000	Here's Shrob, my best friend.
1964000	1968000	And then here's a picture I took of him with his mouth open.
1968000	1969000	And then...
1969000	1971000	This is the end of my slideshow
1971000	1972000	because I didn't have...
1972000	1975000	The key to friendship is understanding.
1983000	1985000	Shrob, do you remember...
1985000	1988000	Do you remember the thing that you made for me?
1988000	1989000	Yeah.
1989000	1990000	Yeah.
1990000	1991000	So if I...
1991000	1994000	I sent this to...
1994000	1996000	I sent it to Neil to...
1996000	1998000	It's like, hey, do you need a title sequence
1998000	2000000	for the Harman Town documentary?
2000000	2001000	Yeah.
2001000	2003000	I think I got it covered.
2003000	2004000	Here's what he sent me.
2004000	2005000	Everybody sent me.
2027000	2029000	I thought that would have worked.
2029000	2031000	I thought that would have worked.
2035000	2036000	All right.
2036000	2037000	I think I'm gonna...
2037000	2038000	That'll be it.
2038000	2042000	That's enough visuals for tonight.
2042000	2046000	It sounded like the Action News soundtrack.
2047000	2048000	All right.
2048000	2049000	All right.
2049000	2050000	So, well...
2050000	2052000	I feel so exposed.
2052000	2053000	All right.
2053000	2054000	So now we have like...
2054000	2057000	We have like an hour and a half more to fill.
2057000	2059000	I feel so exposed.
2059000	2061000	Rob, whose backpack is that?
2061000	2062000	Huh?
2062000	2063000	Is that your...
2063000	2064000	That's not your backpack, is it?
2064000	2065000	My backpack.
2065000	2068000	I'm going to third hour.
2068000	2069000	Oh.
2069000	2070000	You came up with a backpack just to...
2070000	2072000	You thought that would be enough to just make fun of me
2072000	2074000	for wearing my backpack up on stage?
2074000	2076000	It seemed to work.
2077000	2079000	I don't know if anybody...
2079000	2080000	You're talking about it.
2080000	2083000	I don't even like to...
2083000	2085000	We'll figure out what we're doing up here.
2085000	2086000	Yeah, you're talking about it.
2086000	2087000	All right.
2087000	2088000	Let me take a look at my notes.
2088000	2089000	Okay.
2089000	2090000	I really thought...
2090000	2092000	I thought I'd be able to like airplay stuff from my phone
2092000	2094000	and like show you pictures of my dogs.
2094000	2096000	That's what I keep saying is like...
2096000	2097000	The dream.
2097000	2098000	That's the big dream.
2098000	2099000	Pictures of my dogs.
2099000	2102000	But we'll just do a regular show.
2102000	2105000	Because what we've got right now is the HDMI plug
2105000	2107000	and we've enjoyed the hell out of that.
2107000	2110000	Brandon, you don't sit down when you comptroller.
2110000	2111000	Yeah.
2111000	2112000	What's wrong with you?
2112000	2113000	I never know what's going to happen.
2113000	2114000	I might have to run out of here.
2116000	2117000	Burbank.
2118000	2121000	Brandon, I didn't understand the ending of the...
2123000	2124000	All right.
2124000	2126000	While you do that, I'm going to turn my chair around.
2126000	2127000	Wait.
2127000	2128000	Where is that?
2128000	2129000	Oh, you sit cool?
2129000	2130000	I keep finding...
2130000	2131000	So cool.
2131000	2132000	Sit cool.
2133000	2134000	All right.
2134000	2135000	Okay.
2135000	2136000	All right.
2136000	2139000	So these are the only things I have to talk about tonight.
2141000	2145000	The idea of getting naked because you're so high...
2147000	2148000	Yeah.
2148000	2150000	Like, you always hear stories about that.
2150000	2151000	Like, somebody gets...
2151000	2154000	They smoke so much crack or they do so much acid
2154000	2156000	that they take off...
2156000	2158000	Rob's going to die.
2160000	2162000	They take off all their clothes.
2164000	2167000	I can understand trying that, but if it didn't work,
2167000	2169000	wouldn't you put your clothes back on right away?
2169000	2171000	I think eventually they do.
2171000	2172000	Yeah.
2172000	2173000	All right.
2173000	2174000	Moving on.
2175000	2177000	Are you worried about what you're going to do
2177000	2179000	when you get to that moment of being high?
2179000	2180000	Yeah.
2180000	2182000	I just don't think I would ever get so high
2182000	2183000	that I would take off all my clothes.
2183000	2184000	Well, let me...
2184000	2188000	The second time I got high, I showed my friend my dick.
2190000	2192000	Let us all settle in for this.
2193000	2196000	It was the second time I had got high,
2196000	2198000	and we were in my friend's car,
2198000	2200000	and I showed him my dick.
2201000	2203000	Was he asking?
2203000	2204000	No.
2205000	2210000	Was it like the beginning of the Twilight Zone movie
2210000	2212000	where Dan Aykred goes,
2212000	2215000	Hey, you want to see something really scary?
2216000	2218000	And you turn around and you pull out your dick
2218000	2221000	and it's all blue with white hair?
2221000	2224000	Did it say thanks for getting me high and sharpie on it
2224000	2225000	or something?
2226000	2229000	And there was like a comedy whistle noise.
2230000	2234000	Was there something wrong?
2234000	2236000	Like were you asking for advice?
2237000	2238000	No, no.
2238000	2240000	I was giving him advice in a way.
2243000	2245000	Like what to do with your dick?
2245000	2246000	Yeah.
2246000	2247000	Show it.
2248000	2250000	Yeah, check this out.
2250000	2252000	Was it a wreck?
2252000	2253000	No, no.
2254000	2256000	That was why it was funny probably.
2257000	2259000	I don't want to analyze myself in that moment.
2259000	2261000	It's a different punchline.
2261000	2262000	Yeah.
2263000	2265000	If you show your friend a hard dick.
2265000	2266000	Yeah.
2268000	2271000	The first time you got high, did you think,
2271000	2274000	I'm going to, I can't do it yet, but I'm going to do it.
2277000	2280000	The first time I got high, I whipped down my dick
2280000	2282000	and then I was like, no, no, not yet.
2283000	2286000	And I put it away and I didn't tell anybody.
2288000	2290000	Shrob, why don't you?
2290000	2292000	I'm not showing you my dick.
2292000	2295000	You be Spencer's friend and I'll be Spencer.
2296000	2297000	You're driving.
2297000	2300000	You know, it's just like, you know, my mom and dad
2300000	2303000	don't understand what I'm trying to say with my life.
2303000	2305000	Oh, yeah.
2307000	2310000	I mean, that's why I hang out with you because you understand
2310000	2312000	what I'm trying to do.
2312000	2315000	Oh, yeah. I got all the, man, I got so much understanding.
2315000	2317000	It's crazy.
2317000	2320000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2320000	2323000	Hey, do you mind if...
2323000	2326000	Sorry, left or right here?
2326000	2331000	Turn left, but then I've got some advice for you.
2333000	2335000	Bring it on, bro.
2336000	2339000	Zip, that happened.
2341000	2344000	Spencer?
2344000	2345000	Yeah.
2345000	2348000	Your dick is beautiful.
2351000	2354000	Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
2354000	2355000	Just take it easy.
2355000	2357000	Do you know why I pulled you over?
2357000	2359000	Oh, God.
2360000	2363000	Keep your hands up. We don't want to get shot.
2363000	2364000	Why?
2364000	2368000	You made a left turn in a no flashing zone.
2368000	2371000	I don't know. I don't know.
2371000	2374000	Take a look at his cock.
2374000	2377000	It's gorgeous.
2377000	2379000	And scene.
2379000	2381000	Yeah, yeah.
2381000	2384000	I wasn't sure if we should end it. Thank you. Thank you.
2384000	2388000	But there's a post-credit sequence.
2388000	2389000	There's a blooper reel.
2389000	2392000	Sam Jackson is back in Spencer's kitchen going,
2392000	2395000	oh, so you showed your dick, huh?
2396000	2399000	We'll get ready for a wild ride next summer.
2402000	2405000	That's the last movie I ever saw in a theater.
2407000	2409000	The Iron Man.
2411000	2413000	The Iron Man.
2413000	2414000	Millennials.
2414000	2417000	It was called The Iron Man.
2417000	2420000	I liked The Iron Man.
2420000	2424000	I'll take two for The Iron Man.
2424000	2427000	I'm still working out some kinks in my home automation system.
2427000	2430000	One of my dreams is to have a nice little house
2430000	2433000	and be able to control...
2438000	2441000	the speakers and stuff in every room and blah, blah, blah.
2441000	2443000	So there's multiple audio sources.
2443000	2445000	One of the audio sources is an iPod.
2445000	2448000	In case the internet goes out, it's got a little iPod that's full of music.
2448000	2449000	A little iPod.
2449000	2451000	But it syncs with a laptop.
2451000	2454000	All that Apple crap, everything syncs together.
2454000	2456000	So the iPod, and I've been meaning to fix this,
2456000	2459000	but the iPod just has all my voice memos on it.
2460000	2463000	Which I record all my therapy sessions.
2463000	2466000	Fuck, not a good idea.
2466000	2468000	That sounds bad.
2468000	2472000	And so I just looked today because I was trying to play
2472000	2476000	the sneakers soundtrack, which Danny Jelenet gave me as a gift,
2476000	2478000	because you can't get it online.
2478000	2481000	There's no sneakers soundtrack on Spotify.
2481000	2482000	It's a good soundtrack.
2482000	2485000	I remember you gave me the CD in the 90s in Milwaukee, and I lost it.
2485000	2487000	Wynton Marsalis.
2487000	2488000	The...
2488000	2489000	Brand...
2489000	2490000	Brandon?
2490000	2491000	Brantford?
2491000	2492000	Brantford?
2492000	2493000	Brantford Marsalis?
2493000	2494000	Brantford.
2494000	2495000	Brandon?
2495000	2496000	Was it...
2496000	2497000	It's Marsalis, wasn't it?
2497000	2498000	Marsalis Wallace.
2498000	2500000	The...
2500000	2501000	So I'm listening...
2501000	2503000	So I was like, oh, can I play this...
2503000	2505000	You know, there's no CD player anymore.
2505000	2507000	So I'm like, put it in the Blu-ray player,
2507000	2509000	and I'm looking at the different menus and things.
2509000	2512000	It's like, oh, I'm going to play this sneakers soundtrack everywhere.
2512000	2513000	And then I see...
2513000	2516000	And you know how you find out your zipper's been opened?
2516000	2517000	So you have no idea how...
2517000	2520000	It could have been days that your zipper was...
2520000	2523000	If you wore your pants that long, yeah.
2523000	2524000	The...
2524000	2527000	It's like, I look and I see lit up.
2527000	2532000	It's like, the back patio is playing my iPod.
2532000	2533000	Oh, no.
2533000	2536000	So is it playing your therapy out to your neighbors?
2536000	2537000	Yeah.
2537000	2538000	And like...
2538000	2540000	And like, you know...
2540000	2544000	And like, drunken fights I'd have with my ex-wife, you know?
2544000	2546000	You know, like where we'd go...
2546000	2549000	You would go to your therapist drunk and record it?
2549000	2550000	No, no, no.
2550000	2552000	I would record all my therapy sessions.
2552000	2553000	I'm just listing the other...
2553000	2555000	There's a lot of like community ADR.
2555000	2560000	It's like me going like, cool, cool, cool.
2560000	2564000	You know, like doing multiple takes of like dings or Rick and Morty lines
2564000	2567000	or something that like I'm handing to an editor to like scratch in.
2567000	2573000	But then interspersed with that is like eight minute sound files that are like...
2573000	2575000	I'm not yelling at you.
2575000	2576000	Yes, you are.
2576000	2577000	You're always yelling.
2577000	2579000	Well...
2579000	2581000	I'm recording, you know.
2581000	2585000	Go ahead, I'm recording, yeah.
2585000	2586000	Oh, no.
2586000	2588000	Wow.
2588000	2589000	Oh, my God.
2589000	2591000	It was just playing in my back patio.
2591000	2592000	Wow.
2592000	2593000	But I don't really know...
2593000	2596000	And you're like, I'm going to record this...
2596000	2598000	Because it's going to make me look like a real hero.
2598000	2599000	Yeah, no, I don't...
2599000	2600000	Because we were both drunk.
2600000	2602000	We were both, you know, like...
2602000	2605000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
2605000	2606000	Let me get out my phone.
2606000	2607000	Yeah.
2607000	2608000	Well, that's something a drunk person does.
2608000	2609000	Memo?
2609000	2610000	Voice memo.
2610000	2613000	If you're drunk and you're in a fight with another drunk person,
2613000	2617000	like you're both thinking like you're totally stone cold sober and like,
2617000	2620000	you should hear yourself right now.
2621000	2625000	I'm going to Hasselhoff's daughter, you, so hard.
2625000	2631000	And then you get up the next morning and you're like, okay.
2631000	2633000	Let's listen to it together.
2633000	2634000	Let's listen to it.
2634000	2635000	Let's just listen to it.
2635000	2638000	No, no, no.
2638000	2640000	Do your neighbors treat you differently?
2640000	2641000	Has any shit gone?
2641000	2643000	Oh, you were like, what if you woke up the next morning?
2643000	2644000	Oh, no, I don't...
2644000	2645000	Look, I just saw it.
2645000	2646000	That's the thing.
2646000	2647000	It's like, I don't know how long it was playing.
2647000	2649000	I don't know if it played anything specific.
2649000	2650000	I didn't hear anything blaring for the speakers.
2650000	2654000	And I think our neighbors are full of shit.
2654000	2655000	Yeah.
2655000	2656000	Told that neighbor, suck my...
2656000	2660000	Told those neighbors over there with their trees,
2660000	2667000	growing shade on my lawn, causing the sun to not grow my grass.
2667000	2668000	All right.
2668000	2669000	Let's do a segment.
2669000	2671000	My neighbors...
2671000	2674000	I keep thinking we're going to be cutting to like some puppet show over here
2674000	2675000	with this...
2675000	2678000	Lady Elaine's going to come out of the attic and go,
2678000	2681000	oh, hello, Dan.
2681000	2682000	Let's do a segment.
2682000	2683000	Get a sound cue ready.
2683000	2684000	We'll do a segment.
2684000	2686000	This is an old classic.
2686000	2692000	Things that Dan has to complain about that he can't really complain about
2692000	2694000	without sounding like a dick.
2699000	2700000	And it's that...
2700000	2708000	When you're 44 and you have money,
2708000	2713000	your problems are different than when you were 20 and so.
2713000	2716000	When you are also an attention poor,
2716000	2720000	it's hard to complain about the stuff that makes you mad
2720000	2724000	because all the people listening are poor and sad.
2731000	2733000	I really got my finger in the pulse.
2733000	2734000	Yeah.
2734000	2735000	Okay.
2735000	2736000	So here's the thing.
2736000	2741000	I'm sick and tired of doing these...
2741000	2743000	These...
2743000	2746000	Cosmere impressions.
2746000	2747000	I'm sick.
2747000	2748000	I'm never...
2748000	2751000	I'm not doing any more interview requests for publications
2751000	2753000	that are part of a roundup where they're like,
2753000	2758000	yeah, everybody sound in about your favorite genre.
2758000	2759000	I never get chosen.
2759000	2762000	I spend hours on my quotes and email them in
2762000	2763000	and they never use me.
2763000	2767000	They're just using me to get Joss Whedon to say he'll do it.
2769000	2771000	Are you the gateway to Joss Whedon?
2771000	2772000	No, I'm not the gateway.
2772000	2773000	Yeah, that's why I paused in my throat.
2773000	2774000	I just mean like...
2774000	2775000	They're using me to make...
2775000	2777000	Maybe he'll go like, oh, gross.
2777000	2779000	I'll do that because I don't know why he would do that.
2779000	2780000	Why would he do that?
2780000	2781000	Are you telling me you're waiting to talk on topics
2781000	2783000	and these people have not reached out?
2783000	2784000	Wait.
2784000	2785000	No, I'm saying like...
2785000	2786000	I'm just saying like...
2786000	2787000	I lost you.
2787000	2788000	I'm just saying like...
2788000	2789000	That's because it's an unrelatable thing
2789000	2791000	that only I can complain about.
2791000	2792000	When people...
2792000	2795000	You know, when your publicist calls you and says like, oh...
2795000	2798000	You know when your publicist calls you and says,
2798000	2801000	hey, do you want to do this thing?
2801000	2802000	Right.
2802000	2803000	And your publicist calls...
2803000	2806000	Hey, Dan, this is your publicist.
2806000	2808000	Hey, do you want to do this thing?
2808000	2810000	Joss Whedon is going to do it.
2810000	2811000	Will you do it?
2811000	2812000	Yeah.
2812000	2813000	I mean, what...
2814000	2815000	What do you...
2815000	2816000	What do you like?
2816000	2819000	The self-deprecation buttress?
2819000	2820000	Yes.
2820000	2822000	Your yes-anding self-deprecation?
2822000	2823000	This is me.
2823000	2825000	I'm the self-deprecation buttress.
2825000	2828000	Hey, hey, Joss Whedon won't do this.
2828000	2829000	Will you do this?
2829000	2830000	Kevin Smith won't do it.
2830000	2831000	Will you do this?
2831000	2834000	Will you be on the $10,000 pyramid with...
2834000	2840000	With, uh, Soupy Sales and Pee Wee Herman?
2840000	2842000	Will you get on Pee Wee Herman with Soupy Sales?
2842000	2844000	Hey, Dan Harmon, I'm your publicist.
2844000	2846000	Oh, oh, I'm...
2846000	2848000	Oh, I'm going through a tunnel.
2848000	2849000	I'm going through a tunnel.
2849000	2850000	I'm sorry, Dan.
2850000	2851000	I'm sorry, Dan.
2851000	2853000	You're breaking up, Dan.
2853000	2854000	I'm your publicist.
2854000	2855000	I'm going through a tunnel.
2855000	2856000	I'm...
2856000	2857000	I'm your publicist.
2857000	2858000	I'm going through a tunnel.
2858000	2860000	Hey, did you get that...
2860000	2862000	Did you get that email?
2862000	2863000	You never wrote me back.
2863000	2866000	Anyway, Joss Whedon won't do this.
2866000	2867000	Will you do it?
2867000	2868000	Will you do this?
2868000	2869000	Joss Whedon...
2869000	2871000	Joss Whedon won't do it.
2871000	2872000	You know who else won't do it?
2872000	2874000	A lot of other people.
2874000	2878000	Hey, Chris Pratt won't call me anymore.
2878000	2880000	He won't call me anymore.
2880000	2881000	He doesn't call me.
2881000	2883000	Chris Pratt won't call you anymore?
2883000	2885000	Chris Pratt does not call me anymore.
2885000	2887000	He does not call me anymore.
2887000	2891000	He does not like my Instagram pictures.
2891000	2893000	Why are you... you're a publicist.
2893000	2895000	Why do you have an Instagram at all?
2895000	2896000	I mean, except for your personal life.
2896000	2897000	Why do you want Chris Pratt to...
2897000	2900000	I have a personal life, and I want to Instagram it,
2900000	2903000	and I have that right, and I'm going through a tunnel right now,
2903000	2910000	and if you would just be nicer to my...
2910000	2913000	If you want to be famous, why did you become a publicist,
2913000	2917000	and why would you apparently live in a tunnel?
2917000	2920000	That's where all the food is.
2920000	2922000	I'm hungry. I'm starving.
2922000	2924000	A publicist is supposed to...
2924000	2927000	Don't open your laptop.
2927000	2929000	I am, because I want to...
2929000	2931000	You're being a dick, and I want to show...
2931000	2933000	I am not a...
2933000	2935000	Just wait. Don't broadcast anything yet,
2935000	2938000	because I'm so scared that my laptop's going to have...
2938000	2940000	It's more for other people than for me.
2940000	2945000	There's so much pornography on this laptop.
2945000	2947000	You're not broadcasting anything, right?
2947000	2948000	Okay. All right.
2948000	2950000	Just let me find something freely...
2950000	2951000	You're not broadcasting.
2951000	2952000	Well, whatever.
2952000	2953000	We're just going to...
2953000	2956000	You don't have to make me feel like a piece of shit.
2956000	2959000	Rob, you were going through a tunnel.
2959000	2961000	I'm going through a tunnel.
2961000	2963000	Thank you.
2963000	2965000	It's a long tunnel.
2965000	2968000	There's no light at the end of it.
2968000	2972000	So, you just have the two clients, or...?
2972000	2974000	I have two clients.
2974000	2977000	One is my Instagram account.
2977000	2978000	What do you mean?
2978000	2980000	Create Slideshow.
2980000	2982000	You can't just... It has to be created.
2982000	2984000	You can't just...
2984000	2985000	What do you mean?
2985000	2991000	Now's the time to figure it out.
2991000	2993000	Just take a second.
2993000	2997000	Just take a second. Just take a second.
2997000	3000000	Holy shit.
3000000	3006000	Wow, that Fast and Furious movie is really lighting up the box office mojo.
3006000	3009000	Fate and the Furious, more like Great Date and the Furious.
3009000	3010000	Am I right?
3010000	3014000	That's a good first date, Fate of the Furious.
3014000	3019000	Hey, Sasha, would you like to go on Fate and the Furious with me?
3019000	3021000	It's our first date.
3021000	3025000	Oh, Hide Sidebar. There we go. Okay.
3025000	3028000	Hide Sidebar. Okay.
3028000	3030000	Spencer, you're Sasha.
3030000	3033000	Oh, sure.
3033000	3036000	All right, we're standing in line to see the Fate of the Furious.
3036000	3039000	Hey, would you like some popcorn?
3039000	3043000	Sure, and I'll have a soda as well.
3043000	3046000	We'll have a popcorn and soda, please.
3046000	3048000	Welcome to AMC.
3048000	3051000	Oh, okay. We're not even in yet. All right.
3051000	3053000	But I'll remember your request.
3053000	3056000	Sir, sir, welcome to AMC.
3056000	3058000	Sir and ma'am.
3058000	3059000	Let's hear them now.
3059000	3062000	Ma'am, I can't look your date in the eye, sir.
3062000	3063000	Me neither.
3063000	3064000	Please don't.
3064000	3067000	Welcome to AMC. We say that in every part of the interaction.
3068000	3071000	Sasha, you're beautiful. You're so beautiful.
3071000	3073000	Thank you for going out on a date. I'm desperate.
3073000	3075000	All right, you can bring out.
3075000	3077000	I'm just going to show some photos for those of you listening.
3077000	3084000	We'll come back to Sasha and Shrobb on a date saying Fate of the Furious after these messages.
3084000	3085000	It's a gun store.
3085000	3088000	That's a photo of me buying my gun.
3088000	3089000	Here's my gun.
3089000	3091000	Oh, no.
3091000	3094000	I'm showing us to kill something.
3094000	3096000	I still haven't picked it up.
3096000	3097000	Oh, America.
3097000	3100000	Oh, it's better that you haven't picked it up yet.
3100000	3101000	Plus an America.
3101000	3104000	Pacific Dining Car in Burbank has yellow mustard.
3104000	3106000	They put it on the table.
3106000	3107000	Classic yellow.
3107000	3108000	Is it my dogs?
3108000	3109000	Oh, come on.
3109000	3110000	I told you I want to show pictures of my dog.
3110000	3112000	Okay, so that's...
3112000	3116000	That's why I was trying to make my Mass Effect character.
3116000	3117000	I got the gray afro.
3117000	3118000	Can we get more light?
3118000	3119000	This is the best I could do.
3119000	3120000	Can we get more light here?
3120000	3122000	Like right here.
3122000	3125000	Is there a spotlight that we could put on the screen?
3125000	3129000	No, that's the opposite.
3129000	3131000	That's my Mass Effect character.
3131000	3133000	Okay, there's nights on.
3133000	3137000	That picture I took while I was really high at an Easter barbecue.
3137000	3140000	I was like, look at the leaves.
3140000	3142000	Kind of looks like Abraham Lincoln.
3142000	3144000	There's me in a beard and a suit.
3144000	3145000	There's the dogs.
3145000	3146000	This is...
3146000	3148000	I had to watch this while jerking off.
3148000	3150000	This is a guy testing my intercom system.
3150000	3152000	He was down there all day.
3152000	3153000	I'm sorry.
3153000	3154000	That's right next to my bed.
3154000	3155000	That's how I was jerking off.
3155000	3156000	Sophia Cleans.
3156000	3159000	You were jerking off to Sophia Cleans?
3159000	3162000	This is Ken Seeley, my favorite interventionist on intervention.
3162000	3165000	He looks like he's got a little Jim Carrey.
3165000	3167000	There's a little Jim Carrey in there.
3167000	3168000	Yeah, don't get me wrong.
3168000	3173000	I love my Candy Finnegan and my James Van Vondren.
3173000	3175000	If only for his last name.
3175000	3176000	Van Vondren.
3176000	3177000	Come on.
3177000	3179000	That guy must have smoked a lot of crack.
3179000	3183000	He lost his last name.
3183000	3184000	This is another thing.
3184000	3187000	I was high again at a restaurant and I was like, look at that beautiful chandelier.
3187000	3189000	The pictures never really work.
3189000	3190000	Look at this.
3190000	3191000	Look at these phone booths.
3191000	3193000	They're taking them out and they look at all the wires in there.
3193000	3194000	How many...
3194000	3195000	Tell me, things do you need for a phone?
3195000	3197000	Look at this thing.
3197000	3200000	You know, I used to feel bad for phones until...
3200000	3203000	I used to feel bad for phones, too.
3203000	3206000	But then I woke up.
3206000	3208000	There's Seth Green at a signing.
3208000	3217000	This guy looks like Seth Green in disguise, so I took a picture.
3217000	3220000	He looks a little like meth green.
3220000	3224000	Sometimes people ask me to draw stuff for Rick and Morty, so this is Morty sucking capitalism as a dick.
3224000	3229000	By the way, if you're gay and you love to filate or whatever, it doesn't...
3229000	3230000	Or a woman.
3230000	3233000	Wait, well, let's not even get into that.
3233000	3235000	They've got enough problems.
3236000	3237000	I don't know.
3237000	3239000	The whole dick-sucking thing, I think...
3239000	3240000	Yeah, I just want to specify.
3240000	3242000	I want to put an asterisk on that.
3242000	3243000	It's really underrated.
3243000	3248000	I hope it's not a homophobic sentiment when we keep telling each other that we suck dicks.
3248000	3249000	I don't know.
3249000	3254000	We'll take an audible on that with our gay listeners.
3254000	3258000	I found out the ultimate drug to take at a signing is MDMA.
3258000	3264000	I took this little tiny hit that Duncan Trussell gave me and then we went to this signing.
3264000	3266000	I'm sorry if you were there with your family and you had me sign the thing.
3266000	3267000	I was rolling on it.
3267000	3269000	He licked my face.
3269000	3272000	The kids call Molly or whatever.
3272000	3273000	Sorry, but I think it makes me...
3273000	3275000	Why is that the ultimate drug? Why?
3275000	3279000	Because I usually take a little Adderall to get through a signing.
3279000	3282000	It just makes me talk about myself a lot right now.
3282000	3284000	I'm on Adderall and vodka, and I'm going,
3284000	3286000	Ooh, look at me. How can I make my PowerPoint?
3286000	3288000	You're kind of abusive, yeah.
3288000	3292000	But MDMA, it's a perfect blend because people are like,
3292000	3293000	Oh, I came from Phoenix.
3293000	3295000	And you're like, wow, how is Phoenix?
3295000	3297000	Yeah.
3297000	3299000	And it's just enough.
3299000	3302000	You're not like, give me your phone number.
3302000	3304000	It's just like, oh, Phoenix is cool.
3304000	3306000	And it is the truth.
3306000	3311000	And how you feel, it's just hard to get to that place in such a strenuous environment.
3311000	3316000	I read something online that Duncan Trussell went off on a heckler or something.
3316000	3317000	Did you hear about this or whatever?
3317000	3319000	No, he was doing a show here at Andy Dick came.
3319000	3320000	Is that what you're talking about?
3320000	3323000	I don't know. I don't know. Maybe this is old news.
3323000	3325000	Anyway, go back.
3325000	3326000	Speederskout.
3326000	3327000	Look, yeah.
3327000	3330000	Let's talk about more ecstasy.
3330000	3333000	You were on ecstasy when you were talking to people?
3333000	3335000	Well, don't make it sound like that.
3335000	3338000	But I was on ecstasy while I was signing action figures.
3338000	3340000	And then, oh, yeah, look at this.
3340000	3342000	I got one of these fucking things.
3342000	3343000	Stupid virus or something.
3343000	3345000	Oh, the system scan.
3345000	3346000	All right.
3346000	3347000	But then they took me in the back.
3347000	3351000	And look, this guy, he bought some kind of garbage Speederskout.
3351000	3352000	That's not interesting.
3352000	3353000	Okay.
3353000	3354000	All right.
3354000	3355000	Let's close the laptop.
3355000	3356000	All right.
3356000	3357000	Wait.
3357000	3358000	What was that?
3358000	3359000	Man.
3359000	3363000	The reason I opened it up is because I thought I had an album full of the mean shit that you
3363000	3364000	text to me.
3364000	3366000	I don't text mean.
3366000	3367000	Yeah, but okay.
3367000	3370000	But then I open the Slack and then it's like there's shit all over the place.
3370000	3371000	There's the whole slates on there.
3371000	3372000	What do you mean?
3372000	3375000	You're making a Puff the Dragon movie?
3376000	3379000	I'm going to tell Holly Wookie.
3380000	3383000	Puff the Dragon out this fall.
3384000	3385000	All right.
3385000	3386000	Let's get down to business.
3386000	3387000	You're doing great.
3387000	3388000	You're doing great.
3388000	3389000	This is a great first show.
3389000	3391000	We've cooled off the crowd.
3391000	3392000	All right.
3392000	3393000	So how's it going, Shrob?
3393000	3395000	You were taking voice classes before?
3395000	3397000	You're going to make your voice lower?
3397000	3403000	I stopped for a bit because I'm busy working on a rewrite right now of a script I'm working
3403000	3404000	on.
3404000	3406000	You're just getting lower?
3407000	3408000	Yeah.
3409000	3411000	When do you break out the lower voice?
3411000	3414000	This is the lower voice.
3414000	3417000	You should hear when it's not low.
3417000	3422000	If you see somebody from your past, are you going to pick your old voice or your new voice?
3422000	3424000	Like my mom?
3424000	3426000	Why would you see her?
3426000	3429000	Why would I see her ever again?
3430000	3433000	Holidays and birth and stuff?
3434000	3443000	I'll probably revert back to my regular voice that's talking through my nose and stuff.
3443000	3444000	Let's change the subject.
3444000	3445000	This is not good.
3445000	3446000	What do you think of this one?
3446000	3447000	What?
3447000	3449000	What do you think of this?
3450000	3452000	All of a sudden I'm listening to you.
3452000	3454000	Do I command your attention?
3454000	3455000	Yeah.
3455000	3457000	He didn't even need a coach for any of this.
3457000	3459000	He's just changing his voice all around.
3459000	3461000	I would like to do business with you.
3462000	3463000	All right.
3463000	3464000	That's terrifying.
3464000	3467000	I would like to give you business tips and strategies.
3467000	3468000	Okay.
3468000	3470000	Give me the top five business tips.
3470000	3475000	Tip number five for a direct and communicative business strategy.
3475000	3478000	Clothes before you open.
3479000	3482000	Too many closers claim...
3483000	3485000	All right, it's 9-11.
3487000	3488000	It's a great tradition.
3488000	3489000	Yeah.
3490000	3492000	Clothes before you open.
3493000	3494000	Number four.
3495000	3496000	Number four.
3497000	3499000	Always be closing.
3502000	3505000	I'm hearing clothes-ing.
3505000	3506000	No.
3506000	3507000	Like clothes.
3507000	3508000	Number three.
3508000	3510000	Listen carefully.
3511000	3512000	Number two.
3512000	3514000	Listening is for closers.
3515000	3523000	Number one business chip for a communicative direct business strategy for success in the marketplace in the modern era.
3524000	3528000	Open your ears before you close your listening.
3534000	3538000	This is great, great vocal coach advice.
3540000	3541000	But now it's me.
3541000	3542000	Oh shit.
3542000	3544000	See, this is what I sounded like before.
3544000	3546000	I have terrible business advice.
3546000	3547000	Oh my God.
3547000	3550000	I'm going to do the opposite of what you say.
3550000	3555000	So the top five bad choices in business.
3555000	3556000	These are the top five.
3556000	3557000	These are the worst.
3557000	3564000	The bottom five business strategies for direct communicative business environments.
3565000	3566000	Number five.
3566000	3567000	Okay.
3567000	3569000	Reverse the order of your lists.
3570000	3573000	Start with number one.
3575000	3577000	And make that the worst one.
3577000	3578000	Descending.
3581000	3582000	Number four.
3582000	3583000	Clarify.
3583000	3584000	Yeah.
3585000	3586000	For instance.
3587000	3591000	You make your points.
3591000	3599000	Like, come to the.
3599000	3601000	It's like babies fucking.
3602000	3604000	It's like babies fucking.
3611000	3613000	I have those babies fucking.
3613000	3615000	I like to watch the babies cook.
3615000	3630000	I had a girlfriend that wanted to put clothes pins on her nipples, but we never did it.
3631000	3632000	Gross.
3632000	3634000	How do you pass up that opportunity?
3635000	3639000	They were her nipples, so I mean, for me it would have been just like doing laundry.
3639000	3644000	I wasn't like, oh, I've always wanted to.
3644000	3645000	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3645000	3646000	I'd want her to be happy.
3646000	3649000	But I just like, where do you get clothes pins?
3650000	3653000	I had a girlfriend that had a tooth in her pussy.
3658000	3660000	It was like a bone ridge, right?
3660000	3661000	Elaborate.
3661000	3662000	It was like a.
3662000	3665000	Don't use such a fancy word for such a dirty moment.
3666000	3669000	Elaborate on this vaginal tooth.
3671000	3672000	It was like a.
3672000	3673000	Yeah, I felt like a.
3674000	3675000	Yeah.
3675000	3684000	Well, it was like either like a tooth or like I would sometimes describe it as like it was like a cat finger.
3687000	3689000	Cats don't have fingers.
3691000	3693000	I'm telling you what it felt like.
3696000	3699000	And you only have the things your dick has touched as a metric.
3701000	3702000	Lots of.
3706000	3709000	It was like it was like a child's bonnet.
3711000	3712000	I didn't say that.
3712000	3713000	Don't do that.
3713000	3714000	Don't do that.
3714000	3715000	Don't do don't do that.
3715000	3717000	See, I'm in the back of a child's bonnet.
3719000	3722000	A bonnet like child's wears a bonnet.
3723000	3724000	Sorry.
3724000	3725000	OK.
3725000	3726000	OK.
3726000	3727000	Come on.
3727000	3728000	Let's.
3728000	3730000	Are you guys watching the Handmaid's Tale?
3732000	3733000	No.
3733000	3735000	I saw I saw the original movie.
3735000	3736000	It was freaky.
3736000	3737000	It's pretty.
3737000	3738000	Oh, there was.
3738000	3739000	I didn't know there was another annotation of it.
3739000	3742000	Robert Duvall back in like I want to say the 80s late.
3742000	3743000	I want those handmaids.
3744000	3746000	That's my Robert Duvall impression.
3746000	3747000	You got to bring me those handmaids.
3747000	3749000	You better bring me those handmaids.
3750000	3753000	I just caught this is I just caught big little lies.
3753000	3756000	Maybe big little lies ladies out there.
3756000	3765000	I watched the first one of those and then I was like I always I always I always give up too quick on things like I watched the first of the first season of Fargo and then I was like it's too much like Fargo.
3766000	3772000	And then everyone's I wanted something different from the Fargo television series.
3772000	3775000	It was too much like Fargo.
3775000	3776000	The movie.
3777000	3778000	I mean, come on.
3778000	3794000	And then I watched the first big little lies and I was like I like all the people that are in it and I liked I was interested in all the stories but I just couldn't like I there's a pettiness in me that's like I was like when they kept cutting to the people going like she was stone cold.
3794000	3795000	You know what I mean?
3795000	3797000	And I was like, I don't want to stop doing that.
3797000	3798000	I don't like that.
3798000	3800000	Yeah, I feel like I feel like creatively bullied by that.
3800000	3804000	Like I feel like I feel like stop stop elbowing me like so hard.
3804000	3807000	Like just like fucking like cup cup me.
3809000	3810000	What.
3812000	3813000	What what what do you mean?
3813000	3814000	Cup you.
3814000	3816000	Yeah, I just I was just sort of like cup your balls.
3816000	3817000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3817000	3817000	
3817000	3825000	Support like like be there for the parts of me that would otherwise sag and like like but don't don't like don't like be like huh.
3825000	3826000	Think about it.
3826000	3827000	Like no you think about it.
3827000	3828000	You made a TV show.
3829000	3830000	What do you mean?
3830000	3831000	Think about it.
3831000	3832000	Your elbow.
3832000	3833000	You're hurting my ribs.
3833000	3834000	I just want to watch the show.
3834000	3849000	You don't think Nicole Kidman can carry a story in a straight narrative like she's but but but but I know it's just it's the petty part of me because but I will say Patriot like it's turned me around now on like nonlinear storytelling serialized.
3849000	3852000	There's no voiceover in it but I get it.
3852000	3853000	I'm an old fogey.
3853000	3868000	Like if I had my craft is like Gilligan's Island or Knight Rider and like it doesn't it's modular and it's like it's from an old world and next week we have Rob Cordry.
3870000	3871000	He's good.
3872000	3873000	He's good.
3874000	3875000	He's good.
3875000	3876000	He's a good guest.
3876000	3878000	Yeah, he's a good version of a guest.
3878000	3879000	He's a good Rob.
3884000	3885000	Oh, too easy.
3888000	3890000	How's your how's your butthole?
3894000	3896000	You my butthole.
3896000	3898000	How is my butthole?
3898000	3899000	Yeah.
3899000	3900000	Oh, you're offended.
3900000	3901000	You're.
3901000	3902000	Yeah.
3902000	3903000	How dare I mention your butthole.
3903000	3906000	You've shared with us that you obsess about your butthole.
3906000	3907000	You've burnt it with that.
3907000	3908000	True.
3910000	3911000	Okay.
3911000	3912000	Yeah.
3912000	3913000	Fine.
3913000	3914000	My buttholes.
3914000	3916000	How did you how did you burn your butthole?
3916000	3917000	You haven't heard this.
3917000	3918000	No.
3918000	3919000	It's on the list.
3919000	3920000	Yes.
3920000	3921000	No, I.
3922000	3924000	Dan, you want to help me out here?
3924000	3926000	Shrob when he was a kid.
3926000	3927000	No.
3927000	3928000	No.
3929000	3930000	You don't even know what I'm going to say.
3930000	3931000	Okay.
3931000	3932000	Okay.
3932000	3933000	Fine.
3933000	3934000	Shrob when he was a kid.
3934000	3935000	I'm saying if I wrote the biopic about this.
3935000	3936000	Okay.
3936000	3937000	Okay.
3937000	3938000	Fade up.
3938000	3939000	Fade up.
3939000	3940000	Hold open before the title.
3940000	3941000	He's a kid.
3941000	3944000	He used to not wipe his butt very much or something.
3944000	3945000	No.
3945000	3946000	Yes.
3946000	3950000	I will say either did I, but I didn't go to this path.
3950000	3954480	And then when we were in our 20s, I guess in the comedy sports locker room, someone looked
3954480	3957760	at Shrob's underwear and was like, what the fuck?
3957760	3959440	Don't you ever wipe your ass?
3959440	3965360	And then he was like, oh, wait, I always used to say I felt like my butt was itchy and your
3965360	3968000	mom wouldn't say, then wipe your ass more.
3969000	3975000	You've somehow blamed your mom, but so in your 20s, you started to, you, you, you acquired.
3975000	3976000	Overcompensating.
3976000	3978000	You started going like, oh, you're supposed to keep your butt clean.
3978000	3982000	And you kind of became like very embarrassed and fastidious about your butt.
3982000	3986000	And it became like kind of a fixation.
3986000	3990400	And you, and you, so you started like fastidiously cleaning your butt, taking a lot of showers
3990400	3991400	every day.
3991400	3993000	And then you had a girlfriend that was supportive of that.
3993000	3996000	She got you a special shower head that you could reach down there.
3996000	3997000	My wife.
3997000	4003000	And, uh, but she, she, she became my wife.
4003000	4009000	She worked at Bed Bath and Beyond and then he, and then not really kind of her latest.
4009000	4011000	She bought me like a shower snake.
4011000	4012000	Yeah.
4012000	4018000	And then, and then just to watch purposely to after taking a shit, I would have to take
4018000	4020000	a shower and clean out my butt.
4020000	4024000	And then you started doing with more and more hot water because that's what I was taught,
4024000	4026000	how you get dishes clean.
4026000	4027000	Exactly.
4027000	4028000	And it's, it's not untrue.
4028000	4029000	It's not.
4029000	4030000	Yeah.
4030000	4031000	The hotter the temperature.
4031000	4032000	Yes.
4032000	4033000	If you.
4033000	4034000	The tighter the sweater.
4034000	4035000	Yeah.
4035000	4036000	The boys depend on us.
4036000	4037000	Yeah.
4037000	4038000	Right.
4038000	4039000	So then you, then you scalded your butthole.
4039000	4040000	A little bit.
4040000	4044840	And in most of my balls and upper thigh region.
4044840	4048000	And then you went to the doctor and then the doctor said, let's.
4048000	4049000	Holy shit.
4049000	4050000	What did you do to yourself?
4050000	4051000	Yeah.
4051000	4052000	Good God.
4052000	4053000	Are we third?
4053000	4055000	And I don't know why I'm doing this, but is it third degree?
4055000	4056000	It's all burned.
4056000	4057000	Are we burn burn?
4057000	4058000	It's probably third degree.
4058000	4059000	Good God.
4059000	4060000	No, it was third degree.
4060000	4061000	Third degree.
4061000	4062000	I don't know what third degree means.
4062000	4063000	Third degree means Freddy Krueger.
4063000	4064000	Like you could.
4064000	4065000	Right.
4065000	4066000	Okay.
4066000	4067000	Okay.
4067000	4070880	Well, I mean, it wasn't third degree, but it was, it was, it was enough that the doctor
4070880	4075000	went, what did you do to yourself?
4075000	4078720	We were, we were, we were watching this.
4078720	4081960	We watched the, we did a marathon of the old Freddy Krueger show.
4081960	4085600	There was a show on in the nineties when Nightmare on Elm Street 4 was out.
4085600	4087440	There was like, like the peak of Freddy fever.
4087440	4089160	Like Freddy had like a breakfast cereal.
4089160	4091520	He was hosting Friday night videos and whatever.
4091520	4095040	And, and there was this, there was this show called.
4095040	4096040	Is that horror?
4096040	4097040	It's an anthology.
4097040	4102880	It was like a, it was like an anthology called Freddy's Nightmares Colon, A Nightmare on Elm
4102880	4103880	Street Series.
4103880	4109880	No, no, no, Nightmare on Elm Street Colon, The Series.
4110320	4112200	So there was like two colons in this series.
4112200	4113400	So it was like a joke.
4113400	4120400	And we go Freddy's Nightmares Colon, A Nightmare on Elm Street Colon, The Series.
4120400	4123800	And we decided it must have been like, like, like there must have been a rights thing like
4123800	4128000	there, like this wouldn't be a surprising thing if there was like people who had the
4128000	4132680	rights to Freddy the character and then people who had the rights to Elm Street or something.
4132680	4136040	Because that's what would happen with it if any of you are old enough and none of you
4136040	4137040	are.
4137960	4143280	Friday the 13th had an anthology series that didn't have Jason Voorhees in it.
4143280	4147000	It was like a, like a shop of cursed objects.
4147000	4148880	There's an antique store, yeah, of cursed items.
4148880	4155680	Because, because somebody owns Friday the 13th and another big group owns Jason.
4155680	4156680	That's why the last couple of.
4156680	4160320	Which by the way, you know, Friday the 13th, the series with that cursed antique shop totally
4160320	4165760	ripped off the Scooby-Doo, the 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, which was, Vincent Price hired
4165760	4170480	Scooby and Shaggy to work at his store or whatever and they dropped a vase or something
4170480	4173040	and he's like, oh, that had ghosts in it.
4173040	4179120	And I was like, I want you to go out and round up those ghosts.
4179120	4181320	How many are there?
4181320	4186040	As many as in a standard network season order.
4186040	4190160	But also a very spooky number, 13.
4190160	4195520	But in the 13th episode, do you think Scooby brings in the ghost and then he drops the
4195520	4196520	back nine ghosts?
4196520	4197520	All right.
4197520	4204520	Go get the back nine ghosts for a total of 24.
4204520	4207480	Those are the mid-season ghosts.
4207480	4209600	You counted the pilot ghosts.
4209600	4211840	Everyone does that.
4211840	4214360	You're not supposed to do that.
4214360	4220000	Anyways, but then, yeah, you know that, okay, if you're out there and you created Friday
4220000	4225320	the 13th, the series, you know what you did.
4225320	4233960	But also the Night of the Living Dead franchise, we met with George Romero when we were much
4233960	4237840	younger and it was interesting.
4237840	4243640	One of the things it was fascinating was hearing not only how the reason that movies were famous
4243640	4246520	was because of a bunch of mishaps that also unfortunately resulted in it.
4246520	4249720	It was originally called Night of the Flesh Eaters and then at the last minute they changed
4249720	4256240	the name, the title card, but they forgot to put copyright information on it and it
4256240	4257760	became public domain.
4257760	4261200	That's why everybody was allowed to put it at their drive-in theaters for free, so they
4261200	4266960	all did, which was the ultimate distribution tool because it was just the most famous,
4266960	4270560	most successful money-making movie in the world, but Romero and his people didn't really
4270560	4271560	get any of that money.
4271560	4272560	They didn't make any money.
4272560	4273960	That's why they've been remaking it every...
4273960	4278480	But then there was the other reason why you notice with the Night of the Living Dead and
4278480	4286360	it splintered into, I think, Rubenstein owned, it was like, how did it divide?
4286360	4293240	Anything that's of the dead is Romero's property and anything that's a time of the day.
4293240	4296720	Living Dead is owned by, oh God, I forgot his name, I can't believe it.
4296720	4298560	Anybody horror fans out there?
4298560	4301720	What am I looking for?
4301720	4306280	Well, because they don't want to advertise false expertise.
4306280	4307280	What?
4308200	4309520	That's not the way I think I'm sure.
4309520	4310520	That's helpful.
4310520	4311520	Anyway.
4311520	4312520	What did he say?
4312520	4313520	Sharpie butt's alive.
4313520	4314520	Oh.
4314520	4315520	He's just...
4315520	4317040	I'm just jumping out stuff.
4317040	4322520	I mean, anything to stretch the time at this point, I mean, I got it.
4322520	4323960	I got so nervous about the visuals.
4323960	4325680	I was like, can I see photos of my dog?
4325680	4329920	And then, you know, everybody's like, yeah, but not if you use the track pad or something.
4329920	4331320	And I was like, oh God, what are we going to do?
4331320	4334880	And then the first 10 minutes, it's like, just burnt out our energy with all those visuals.
4334880	4338600	There's a mannequin with pantyhose on it and I'm like, now what are we doing?
4338600	4343560	It's like listening to a golf tournament.
4343560	4347040	People enjoy that.
4347040	4353240	Human moves up to the bit, stands in front of the bit, and slowly tries to whack it.
4353240	4354240	Is there a cricket in here?
4354240	4355240	Yeah.
4355240	4356240	It sounds like it's over there.
4356240	4357240	Well, that's nice.
4357240	4358560	Maybe that's the meltdown cricket.
4358560	4359560	He followed us.
4359560	4360560	Or a sheet.
4360560	4361560	People always think it's a fan.
4361560	4362560	It's a fucking cricket.
4362560	4363560	That's what cricket sounds like.
4363560	4365560	Ladies can be crickets.
4365560	4375840	Oh, shit, that was a secret mic drop that didn't go to nowhere.
4375840	4376840	I haven't dropped it yet.
4376840	4377840	No, no, I haven't dropped it yet.
4377840	4378840	All right.
4378840	4379840	What were we talking about?
4379840	4382680	Horror movies, Freddy Krueger, third degree burn, your butthole.
4382680	4383680	Okay.
4383680	4384680	Yeah.
4384680	4389240	You know, my grandpa had third degree burns all over his body.
4389240	4390240	He's gone now.
4391000	4393400	He blew up in an oil tank.
4393400	4397120	Not in the war, but after he got back, he was already a pretty old guy.
4397120	4400360	He was already my grandpa.
4400360	4405560	And he blew up while he was welding the inside of a gas tank.
4405560	4407520	Oh, don't do that.
4407520	4408600	Underneath gas stations.
4408600	4409600	Don't do that.
4409600	4411000	If you do that, no, no, no.
4411000	4412000	Don't do that.
4412000	4415980	If you were to excavate all the earth around a gas station, you'd see these giant tanks
4415980	4419160	where all the gas goes down there, and they need maintenance down there.
4419200	4423200	I guess you go down with a blowtorch, and sometimes they haven't left the fan on long
4423200	4426160	enough overnight to get all those gas fumes out of there.
4426160	4427160	Big explosion.
4427160	4430480	They said that the tools were melted to the floor of the gas tank.
4430480	4431640	That's how hot it was in there.
4431640	4435000	Like the rungs of the ladder to get out were like melted.
4435000	4438600	And he was in there as a human being made of meat.
4438600	4445000	And he, I remember being a kid and going to the hospital and being terrified of my own
4445000	4446000	grandpa.
4446000	4448760	Don't be scared.
4448760	4453120	Which I thought was kind of cool, because he was like, he should have been like, ouch.
4453120	4455920	And he was like worried about me being scared of how...
4455920	4457240	Yeah, he should have been like, be scared.
4457240	4458240	Yeah, I would.
4458240	4459240	I'm terrified.
4459240	4460240	Go to college.
4460240	4461240	Right.
4461240	4462240	Right.
4462240	4463240	Right.
4463240	4464240	And not for welding.
4464240	4466400	Don't pull one of those.
4466400	4474200	But he ended up, by the time he died, he looked totally, you would never have known from looking
4474200	4475200	at him.
4475200	4478800	I thought it was like 90% of his body was like third degree, so I don't even understand
4478800	4479800	how they did that.
4479800	4483240	There was a talk of like skin graft from his butt or something, but like, can you skin
4483240	4485360	graft and like wait for skin to grow back?
4485360	4486560	Why are you asking me?
4486560	4487560	I don't know.
4487560	4491360	Or what am I supposed to ask, the fucking surgeon general?
4491360	4494520	Yes, you can do that.
4494520	4496720	It's an out loud rhetorical question.
4496720	4497720	You know?
4497720	4500520	His question, settlement?
4500520	4501520	You know what?
4501520	4502520	Fucking...
4502520	4503520	I don't think so.
4503520	4504520	I never even heard a thing about that.
4504520	4506440	You could have said something.
4506440	4507440	Don't do that.
4507440	4511720	Maybe it was like his idea to go in while there was gas in there or something so he
4511720	4512720	couldn't sue anybody.
4512720	4513720	I don't know.
4513720	4514720	Don't do it!
4514720	4515720	Don't do it!
4515720	4517720	Knowing him, though, he probably would have been like, I want to go down there!
4517720	4519640	I want to do some welding!
4519640	4520960	No, come on!
4520960	4523800	The fans, don't do it!
4523800	4529200	I'm sure he would have been like, no, I'm not going to sue.
4529200	4533840	He lied about his age to go fight World War II because he couldn't get in there fast enough
4533840	4539160	and I'm sure he didn't want to, maybe didn't, if a lawyer called him, he'd probably be like,
4539160	4540160	fuck you.
4540160	4541160	Good God.
4541160	4543160	The Harmon's cut from a steel cloth.
4543160	4544160	Yeah.
4544160	4545160	Yeah.
4545160	4546160	That generation's all gone now.
4546160	4550480	It was all pussies now.
4550480	4551480	What is the hardest...
4551480	4556120	The manlier your grandparents are, because it's like, well, it's like the microcosm of
4556120	4557120	the nation.
4557120	4561320	They like protected us and fought Nazis for real and like, yeah, and then we joined improv
4561320	4564800	troops when we were 35 and just complained.
4564800	4565800	We do Twinkies.
4565800	4567800	This Twinkie's too soft.
4567800	4570120	I want my money back.
4570120	4571680	We take you to this intelligentsia.
4571680	4572680	Hey, uh...
4572680	4577640	I'm going to hashtag this Twinkie until you get sued and fired.
4577640	4580480	I'm a snowflake.
4580480	4584520	Who like has the hardest job in your family?
4584520	4588600	Like that's definitely me.
4588600	4589600	Hardest job.
4590360	4592240	Who followed in his footsteps?
4592240	4597840	I'd have to say the next closest manliest thing would be my uncle that airbrushes the
4597840	4599680	sides of vans and...
4599680	4600680	What?
4600680	4601680	There's really nobody.
4601680	4604680	I'm sure somebody's offended in my family if they're listening, but I don't think they're
4604680	4605680	listening.
4605680	4607680	Can he do a jacket?
4607680	4610400	Didn't he airbrush a jacket for you?
4610400	4612000	He airbrushed lots of jackets.
4612000	4613680	Now he's passed away.
4613680	4615680	He got brain cancer.
4615680	4617880	So lucky.
4617880	4618880	Yeah.
4619640	4620640	Sorry.
4620640	4622480	It's been a rough week.
4624480	4625480	No, I don't...
4625480	4626480	It's not a...
4626480	4627480	It's not a...
4627480	4629480	It was my great-grandma, Busce.
4629480	4631320	Busce is Polish for grandma.
4631320	4634960	I think it's like the Polish version of Mima is Busce.
4634960	4641320	But Busce, she was, you know, I think it's okay to say she murdered a guy.
4641320	4643200	I think it's okay to say.
4643200	4647440	She was a vaudevillian and she probably murdered a guy, maybe.
4647920	4648920	I'm sure he deserved it.
4648920	4650400	It was like it was probably...
4650400	4652400	Break this shit down.
4652400	4655560	Like she did it with her act or she did it in the middle of an act or how did...
4655560	4658600	I've told the story before, but it was like...
4658600	4662400	And I feel like every time I go back and visit my parents, I find out I'm wrong about all
4662400	4663400	these details.
4663400	4668320	But I felt like my great-grandma, she was like...
4668320	4671040	She was living with a guy or he was like...
4671040	4672040	I don't know.
4672040	4673040	And then like...
4673040	4676240	I just remember the story was that people were watching a football game and then they
4676240	4681480	broke into the football game and said, like, an 83-year-old woman is being questioned in
4681480	4687240	the stabbing death of a man and everyone joked, like, 83, that's got to be Grandma Busce!
4687240	4690840	And then the phone rang and...
4690840	4692560	Because she was just like a...
4692560	4696360	She was like really salty, like very, very salty.
4696360	4697360	Yeah.
4697360	4702800	Like I've told the stories about her that I have, I mean, but yeah, that she...
4702800	4707040	They questioned her and she said she said he fell on the scissors, like, several times
4707040	4712880	and they let her go, I assume, because they were like...
4712880	4718960	She's almost dead and then she lived for, like, 20 more years, leaving a trail of bodies
4718960	4723680	as long as the Route 66.
4723680	4729080	But she, along the way, between that and her natural death at, like, very late 90s, if
4729080	4730080	not...
4730080	4731640	I think she might have broke 100, did she?
4732000	4733000	I don't know.
4733000	4739440	But between that questioning for the homicide and the actual death, she got her throat slashed
4739440	4743560	by somebody that broke into her house to take her microwave because she owed them money.
4743560	4745560	Fucking shit!
4745560	4746560	And there's like a...
4746560	4747560	There's a...
4747560	4748560	I've talked about this.
4748560	4749560	What?
4749560	4750560	I've talked about this.
4750560	4751560	I didn't know about...
4751560	4754400	No wonder why we moved to Burbank.
4754400	4755400	God!
4755400	4757640	So you could start your criminal empire.
4757680	4763920	My parents have the news footage on VHS of the doctor because it's like she got her throat
4763920	4764920	slashed...
4764920	4765920	Holy...
4765920	4768560	And she hung out at her house bleeding...
4768560	4770000	After her throat was slashed?
4770000	4773240	And then she realized nobody was going to be around for a while so she wrapped her neck
4773240	4781640	in a towel and walked to the hospital and then it was like...
4781640	4783320	There's news footage of the...
4783320	4786760	They go, like, a woman got her throat slashed and then walked herself to the hospital with
4786760	4791480	a towel wrapped around her neck and then they show, like, an interview in the hospital
4791480	4796920	lobby with the doctor who performed the stitching and he's going...
4796920	4798640	He's doing this interview and he's like...
4798640	4805560	He's going, like, uh...
4805560	4809840	A woman came in.
4809840	4812800	Her throat had been slashed.
4812800	4817120	She was 91 years old or whatever.
4817120	4820120	I stitched it closed.
4820120	4821120	He's like marveling.
4821120	4822120	He's like, what?
4822120	4824360	Am I a genius or is she Frankenstein's monster?
4824360	4826360	I don't know what...
4826360	4827360	He's like...
4827360	4828360	He's trying to figure it out.
4828360	4832280	He's like, no one told me this was going to happen in school but he's like, I did what
4832280	4834160	I'm supposed to do.
4834160	4840480	It's not supposed to work under those circumstances but, you know, I took an oath to try and it
4840480	4842640	worked and she left!
4842640	4846280	She walked out!
4846280	4848320	He's going, like, that's the answer to your question.
4848320	4853680	I know you're going to not believe me but he's just marveling at it.
4853680	4854680	He's a doctor.
4854680	4855680	He's seen it all.
4855680	4856680	Yeah.
4856680	4857680	That is crazy.
4857680	4858680	Yeah.
4858680	4859680	And she used to, you know...
4859680	4860680	And I don't want to slander her because she's lived...
4860680	4862680	Because she'll come back and fuck you up.
4862680	4866360	She's murdered the dude that's about to hit.
4866360	4870680	She was very amorous with the grandkids.
4870680	4874200	She liked young men and she liked...
4874200	4878080	She went out, like, functional, you know?
4878080	4883040	She wasn't, like, retired in the...
4883040	4884040	Sexual department.
4884040	4885040	Yeah.
4885040	4886040	She was, like, on fire, you know?
4886040	4887120	She liked to get down.
4887120	4892280	She would, like, nude sunbathe or, like, 95-year-old took us in the sun and...
4892280	4893280	With the battle scar.
4893280	4894280	Yeah.
4894280	4897680	A beautiful visual for all the home listeners.
4897680	4900440	And she was a vaudevillian and my parents would always tell me, you got to talk...
4901200	4902200	You're the other performer in the family.
4902200	4904200	You should talk to Grandma Boucher about vaudeville.
4904200	4906200	And everybody was like, you should talk to Grandma Boucher about vaudeville.
4906200	4910200	And then, like, I finally, like, went up to her at, like, Easter or something and said,
4910200	4912200	like, Grandma Boucher, what was vaudeville like?
4912200	4915200	Oh, it was so good.
4915200	4918200	Vaudeville was the best.
4918200	4919200	Yeah.
4919200	4920200	She was, like...
4920200	4921200	Well, she kind of...
4921200	4922200	She was, like, what do you want to know?
4922200	4924200	And I was, like, what was it like?
4924200	4927200	And she's, like, it was a stage.
4927200	4928200	Like, she was just, like...
4928960	4929960	I was like, fuck you, man.
4929960	4930960	Fuck you.
4930960	4932960	I didn't even want to ask.
4932960	4936960	I could go ask Grandpa about Iwo Jima next, you know?
4936960	4938960	Like, I'm just doing this for you guys.
4938960	4940960	Like, I don't know what these words mean.
4940960	4941960	How was...
4941960	4944960	I was making your own baseball out of cork.
4944960	4946960	Uncle Tony told me to ask.
4946960	4948960	Because apparently the answer is, it's hard.
4948960	4949960	It's easy.
4949960	4950960	I'm seven.
4953960	4955960	Well, you take the cork and you rub the string around it.
4955960	4956960	I don't know any...
4957720	4960720	I'm going to appreciate this when I'm almost dead.
4960720	4962720	That's when I'm going to be like, whoa, making your own baseball.
4962720	4963720	Holy shit.
4966720	4970720	It's going to take a while for me to appreciate this stuff.
4970720	4973720	I think you'd appreciate the fucking knife thing more.
4973720	4974720	That is crazy.
4974720	4975720	You know something...
4975720	4977720	Did they catch the guy who did that?
4977720	4978720	It was a woman.
4978720	4980720	Yeah, because it was a microwave.
4980720	4981720	So that makes sense.
4981720	4983720	Because women use microwaves.
4983720	4985720	Oh, hate me.
4985720	4987720	We all use microwaves.
4987720	4988720	That's the job.
4988720	4990720	I've got to defrost this stuff.
4990720	4992720	I've got to defrost this fruit.
4992720	4993720	Give me this.
4993720	4995720	Give me back my microwave.
4995720	4997720	I've got to defrost this fruit, Mosha.
4997720	4998720	Mosha.
4998720	4999720	Give me the microwave.
4999720	5001720	I've got to defrost this fruit.
5001720	5002720	No, no, no.
5002720	5004720	Scissors, motherfucker.
5004720	5006720	Cutting your throat.
5006720	5007720	Give me...
5007720	5011720	I'm going to defrost this fruit and plug it in in my kitchen.
5011720	5012720	Can you get the...
5012720	5014720	I can't get the door open.
5014720	5016720	I'm going to defrost this fruit.
5016720	5020720	I'm going to defrost this fruit with Mosha's microwave.
5020720	5022720	This is my house.
5022720	5024720	I'm going to plug it in.
5024720	5025720	Okay.
5025720	5026720	I want some...
5026720	5028720	I want some grapes.
5028720	5030720	And some bananas.
5030720	5031720	Okay.
5031720	5032720	I want some...
5032720	5035720	I want some grapes.
5035720	5038720	And some banana slices.
5038720	5041720	Two minutes should probably do it.
5046720	5048720	We'll fast forward.
5048720	5049720	Bling.
5049720	5051720	Nope, nope, not enough.
5051720	5056720	Bling, bling.
5056720	5061720	Meanwhile, at the board of banana and grape farmers...
5061720	5063720	Gentlemen, we have a problem.
5063720	5067720	The microwave culture is upon us, and our fruit takes too long to microwave.
5067720	5069720	It takes too long.
5069720	5070720	I'm willing to kill people.
5070720	5073720	Jesus, it's a knife-wielding woman.
5073720	5074720	Give me some...
5074720	5075720	Don't freeze it anymore.
5075720	5077720	Why you got to freeze it?
5077720	5080720	Just take it off the tree, put it in a bowl, and give it to me.
5080720	5081720	I'm starving.
5081720	5082720	Give it.
5082720	5083720	Give it.
5083720	5087720	Oh, you're so strong.
5087720	5090720	Your hands are so strong.
5090720	5092720	Oh, your hands are so strong.
5092720	5095720	They look like little bananas.
5095720	5096720	No.
5096720	5097720	God, no.
5097720	5099720	I know you love them so much that you'll stab them.
5099720	5100720	Fuck you.
5100720	5101720	Oh, my throat.
5101720	5102720	Oh.
5102720	5109720	I'm taking every banana and every grape.
5109720	5113720	And I'm going to run away, and they're already defrosted.
5113720	5115720	Get me a towel.
5115720	5118720	I know how this works.
5118720	5120720	Why am I dying?
5120720	5124720	Because you don't got that bush of blood.
5124720	5126720	And that's how it happened.
5126720	5128720	Yeah, you can't kill a Harmon, I guess.
5128720	5129720	They don't really die.
5129720	5132720	I mean, not before like a thousand or whatever.
5132720	5133720	Yeah.
5133720	5136720	I mean, you drink yourself to death, or you maybe like...
5136720	5138720	Midwest people got good genes, you know.
5138720	5140720	We live long.
5140720	5142720	We don't want to.
5142720	5144720	But we live long.
5144720	5145720	Yeah.
5145720	5146720	Yeah.
5146720	5147720	I know.
5147720	5148720	What kind of life is it?
5148720	5154720	You get these like erasers on your collarbone, like fucking skin tags and stuff if you're
5154720	5156720	Polish-descended.
5156720	5160720	I like to have these things like come off and look like little fucking erasers.
5160720	5162720	And then I'll be like, is that cancer?
5162720	5165720	And then like a week later, fall off or something when I sleep.
5165720	5167720	Hair growing out of your ears.
5167720	5168720	And your nose.
5168720	5171720	Nose fills up with barbed wire.
5171720	5173720	Ears getting all big.
5173720	5174720	That ear thing really freaks me out.
5174720	5176720	You see people's giant ass ears.
5176720	5179720	Why do your ears get so big?
5179720	5181720	Your head actually shrinks.
5181720	5183720	Oh, are you doing a bit?
5183720	5184720	No, no, no.
5184720	5185720	Your head shrinks?
5185720	5188720	Your head gets smaller and your ears stay the same.
5188720	5189720	Shut up.
5189720	5194720	It's because it's like soft tissue and it's like it's gravity.
5195720	5197720	But you'd think they would just lower.
5197720	5199720	They just droop lower.
5199720	5203720	How come the tops of them, you look like Ferengi.
5203720	5204720	You get old enough.
5204720	5206720	Isn't that the right alien I'm thinking of?
5206720	5209720	Yeah, you're looking at a senator.
5209720	5213720	Hey, is it pronounced omniscient or omniscient?
5213720	5215720	You can pronounce it omniscient.
5215720	5219720	Don't take my girlfriend's side.
5219720	5222720	There's a lot of words I only learned in print.
5222720	5226720	My dad always used to say measure instead of measure
5226720	5228720	and be a real asshole about it.
5228720	5231720	And he'd get out the dictionary and he'd see,
5231720	5235720	see, there's a little line over the A in the pronunciation guide.
5235720	5236720	It's measure.
5236720	5240720	And then everyone would hate him.
5240720	5242720	Then he moved to Columbia.
5242720	5246720	My dad would say, he's alive.
5246720	5250720	My dad says Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
5250720	5251720	Yeah.
5251720	5252720	What the fuck is that?
5252720	5254720	What moon is he from?
5254720	5257720	People in St. Louis say Warsh and Fark.
5257720	5259720	My dad says Quata.
5259720	5262720	But he's not from fucking Delaware or anything.
5262720	5264720	But he says Warsh sometimes.
5264720	5265720	That's weird.
5265720	5267720	Antaner is another one.
5267720	5269720	Look at that car, Antaner.
5269720	5270720	Am I going to go R?
5270720	5271720	No.
5271720	5274720	People malign me for my pronunciation of the word bagel.
5274720	5278720	But don't ever, what's that?
5278720	5280720	They agree with you.
5280720	5282720	Bagel, bagel, bagel, bagel.
5282720	5283720	I can't.
5283720	5284720	I can't.
5284720	5286720	Bagel, bagel, bagel, bagel.
5286720	5289720	I lived in New York.
5289720	5290720	My dad did?
5290720	5291720	No, he didn't.
5291720	5294720	You didn't deserve that.
5294720	5296720	No, I didn't.
5296720	5299720	You didn't.
5299720	5300720	All right.
5300720	5305720	So Spencer, what about your ham grandma?
5305720	5306720	Your baloney grandma?
5306720	5309720	Oh, my baloney grandma.
5309720	5311720	Spencer's got kind of a nutty grandma.
5311720	5312720	Is she still with us?
5312720	5314720	My baloney's got her first name.
5314720	5316720	It's G-R-A-M-A.
5316720	5319720	Can you tell us a little bit about your baloney grandma?
5319720	5321720	Yeah, no, she's still with us.
5321720	5323720	Where is she right now?
5323720	5325720	She's behind you.
5325720	5327720	Oh, no.
5327720	5328720	She went crazy.
5328720	5331720	She has had bipolar disorder.
5331720	5333720	But...
5333720	5336720	New space, new jokes.
5336720	5340720	But most recently, it's manifested in pyromancy.
5340720	5341720	No, pyromania.
5341720	5342720	What?
5342720	5346720	Pyromancy's magical creation of fire.
5346720	5349720	Does she wave her hands in a magical manner?
5349720	5350720	Yeah.
5350720	5352720	She knows burning hands.
5352720	5354720	Whoa.
5354720	5355720	No, okay.
5355720	5358720	So she ended up getting kicked out of my grandpa's house
5358720	5359720	because she would...
5359720	5361720	Were they related?
5361720	5363720	By marriage, yeah.
5363720	5366720	She would strike matches and throw them onto the ground
5366720	5369720	where there was sometimes carpet.
5369720	5371720	She would light on pieces of paper on fire
5371720	5374720	and just toss them into waste paper baskets and walk away.
5374720	5377720	Now, I'm going to say something to you that really fed me up
5377720	5380720	when I would tell people about Boucher.
5380720	5383720	But I feel...
5383720	5385720	That sounds like the coolest grandma ever.
5385720	5389720	She's setting fires.
5389720	5390720	I never saw her.
5390720	5391720	People would be like,
5391720	5393720	Damn the guy, that's amazing.
5393720	5394720	And your grandpa was like,
5394720	5395720	Oh, what the fuck are you doing?
5395720	5396720	What are you doing?
5396720	5397720	Sit down.
5397720	5398720	It's on fire.
5398720	5399720	What are you going to do about it?
5399720	5400720	What are you going to do about it, old man?
5400720	5401720	Are you going to stop me?
5401720	5404720	It would have been cool if we saw that.
5404720	5407720	So your grandma had something from her youth.
5407720	5409720	Honey, don't light the garbage on fire.
5409720	5412720	She had adult onset pyromania.
5412720	5414720	Yeah, I don't know.
5414720	5415720	How far?
5415720	5416720	What?
5416720	5417720	How far did it go?
5417720	5419720	What's the biggest shit she ever burned out?
5419720	5420720	To the top, right?
5420720	5421720	No, I don't know.
5421720	5423720	I don't think she really burnt anything down.
5423720	5424720	It was weird.
5424720	5425720	I don't understand it.
5425720	5427720	But it was basically explained as like a compulsion.
5427720	5430720	Like she just did it kind of like for fun and absentmindedly.
5430720	5433720	Like she didn't really clock that she was doing it.
5433720	5434720	But who knows?
5434720	5436720	She was like Donald Sutherland's character in Backdraft.
5436720	5437720	That's what I was telling my mom.
5437720	5440720	Some grandmas just want to watch the world burn.
5440720	5441720	Yeah.
5441720	5444720	Grandma, what would you do if we let you out?
5444720	5445720	Burn it.
5445720	5447720	Burn it all.
5447720	5450720	But she decided she wanted to own a hostel.
5450720	5454720	So she moved to Nevada and she bought a hostel.
5454720	5455720	It's bad.
5455720	5457720	I mean, she's gone kind of nuts.
5457720	5460720	One time the police picked her up in Sacramento
5460720	5463720	because she was just handing out $20 bills on the corner.
5463720	5464720	What?
5464720	5465720	Hey, stop doing that.
5465720	5466720	I know.
5466720	5470720	Hey, what are you doing?
5470720	5471720	I'm not doing anything.
5471720	5472720	I'm not doing anything.
5472720	5473720	Hey, hey.
5473720	5474720	Stop it.
5474720	5475720	I'll stop it.
5475720	5476720	Stop it.
5476720	5480720	I'm going to arrest you for handing out $20 bills.
5480720	5486720	Will you arrest me if I don't wave this 20 past your eyes?
5486720	5491720	Are you trying to anti-bride me?
5491720	5496720	But when she set up the hostel, it was like with swindlers.
5496720	5499720	Because usually it's good people that want to own a hostel,
5499720	5500720	I think.
5500720	5501720	But these were swindlers.
5501720	5502720	Yeah.
5502720	5504720	Except they took a bunch of money from her.
5504720	5506720	No, we were going to get lunch to visit her one time
5506720	5507720	because it was crazy.
5507720	5510720	The whole state of Nevada smells like cigarette smoke,
5510720	5511720	by the way.
5511720	5513720	But we were driving around looking for food,
5513720	5515720	and she was like, oh, you want food?
5515720	5516720	I can help you out.
5516720	5521720	And we were like, oh, what an ominous sentence.
5521720	5526720	And she reaches into her own on-her-foot boot
5526720	5530720	and pulls out a package of 79-cent Carl Buddig
5530720	5531720	honey-baked ham.
5531720	5533720	Oh, no.
5533720	5534720	No, Grandma.
5534720	5537720	And I don't know what it says about her circulation
5537720	5540720	or about, I don't know, thermodynamics,
5540720	5542720	but it was still frozen.
5542720	5544720	No.
5544720	5549720	Despite, like, no meat in my shoe would stay frozen.
5549720	5555720	Your grandma's circulation is so poor,
5555720	5557720	she could keep cold cuts in her boot.
5557720	5559720	Grandma, come on.
5559720	5560720	Come out to the car.
5560720	5561720	We're leaving.
5561720	5563720	One second.
5563720	5564720	To camera.
5564720	5567720	I'm probably going to need this.
5567720	5572720	Just in case the opportunity arises.
5572720	5574720	You got a crazy grandma, Brandon?
5574720	5576720	I mean, no.
5576720	5577720	I don't either.
5577720	5581720	My grandma was the head of the Democratic Party for Missouri.
5581720	5582720	Yay.
5582720	5591720	Now, though, I do kind of wish that she'd had some fucked up shit
5591720	5593720	just to be in the company of.
5593720	5598720	It would be useful for this exact scenario.
5598720	5599720	Why is your family so political?
5599720	5601720	You have a sister that's like a hardcore activist, right?
5601720	5602720	My sister's pretty nuts.
5602720	5605720	She'll call me from fucked up locations.
5605720	5606720	I'm a Ferguson.
5606720	5608720	They shouldn't.
5608720	5611720	It's the craziest thing.
5611720	5614720	And you said your sister has a hard time earning her way
5614720	5619720	into these troubled spots because she kind of has a very
5619720	5621720	put together vibe.
5621720	5623720	I mean, you could take it from me any time
5623720	5625720	before I stick my foot in my mouth.
5625720	5626720	No, no, no.
5626720	5630720	I love your diatribes on black women.
5630720	5632720	You know, we came from the suburbs,
5632720	5633720	so when you're trying to help people
5633720	5634720	that are in a different neighborhood
5634720	5636720	and they hear you talk like this,
5636720	5639720	it can be a little confusing.
5640720	5641720	Unless you're like, the last time
5641720	5643720	I had some shit like this was on the Jeffersons
5643720	5645720	when they would go down to the Help Center.
5645720	5646720	Do you remember?
5646720	5647720	Oh, those episodes.
5647720	5649720	What?
5649720	5651720	I thought he just ran a laundromat.
5651720	5653720	All the old black people over 65 were referencing
5653720	5655720	the Jeffersons now.
5655720	5657720	They would go down to the Help Center.
5657720	5658720	Yeah, on the Jeffersons, they used to go down
5658720	5660720	because they were rich black people,
5660720	5661720	so they felt like they had to give back,
5661720	5663720	so they would go down to the Help Center
5663720	5665720	and they would do all sorts of shit.
5665720	5667720	That seems like a shark jump, though.
5667720	5671720	I thought George Jefferson was kind of a stingy self.
5671720	5675720	That storytelling that you crave so much.
5675720	5677720	The Jeffersons definitely were not like
5677720	5679720	the Freddy Krueger the series show.
5679720	5681720	We had Norman Lear on the show.
5681720	5684720	Yeah, she goes into some crazy locations
5684720	5686720	where when they hear her talk,
5686720	5688720	they're a little suspect.
5688720	5690720	She might be saying,
5690720	5692720	get your hand out of my pocket.
5692720	5696720	Yeah, she's there to create a diversion.
5696720	5699720	Yeah, what the fuck are we going to do?
5699720	5703720	I heard the March, the latest march went well.
5703720	5705720	The climate march.
5705720	5707720	It went well.
5707720	5709720	The climate's better now.
5709720	5714720	But good turnout or whatever.
5714720	5717720	I was looking on Twitter
5717720	5722720	and just watching the conservative tweeters
5722720	5723720	going like,
5723720	5725720	what if you're going to have a march every week?
5725720	5726720	I don't know why.
5726720	5728720	So far, yeah.
5728720	5731720	There's May Day tomorrow, so yeah.
5731720	5734720	Yeah.
5734720	5737720	And with the looming writer strike,
5737720	5739720	it's kind of an important May Day.
5739720	5742720	Or is the Trump supporters like to call it Loyalty Day?
5742720	5745720	Well, let me lay my ignorance on the altar
5745720	5747720	for the benefit of everyone listening
5747720	5749720	so you can explain what May Day is to me.
5749720	5752720	I have no idea what it is.
5752720	5753720	I could be totally wrong,
5753720	5758720	but I thought May Day was International Workers Day, right?
5758720	5760720	All right, see? I'm glad I asked.
5760720	5763720	I'm brave for admitting I don't know anything.
5763720	5765720	Yeah, you are brave.
5765720	5769720	I'll tell you everything I know about America in five minutes.
5769720	5771720	Let me time myself.
5771720	5773720	I'll take you through the whole history of the country.
5773720	5774720	Okay, here we go.
5774720	5775720	Let's see.
5775720	5778720	I'm going to make this a new segment.
5778720	5779720	Stopwatch.
5779720	5780720	Okay, I'm going to go.
5780720	5781720	I'm going to set it.
5781720	5782720	Wait, okay.
5782720	5785720	Two minutes to figure out how my phone works.
5785720	5789720	And then, no, zero hours.
5789720	5790720	Well, let's try it this way.
5790720	5794720	Let's just say, hey, Siri.
5794720	5796720	Hey, Siri.
5796720	5799720	Hey, Siri.
5799720	5803720	Hey, can you set a five-minute timer, please?
5803720	5806720	Okay, five minutes and counting.
5806720	5807720	Okay, all right, okay.
5807720	5813720	So in 1492, Columbus came over, and there were three other boats,
5813720	5815720	and then they landed on Plymouth Rock,
5815720	5817720	and then they had Thanksgiving with all the pilgrims
5817720	5819720	and the Indians that were here already.
5819720	5823720	And then the Salem people came over, and they were Puritans,
5823720	5825720	so they burned all the witches because they were on LSD.
5825720	5830720	And then things just kind of blossomed from there,
5830720	5833720	but everyone was eating potatoes and corn, and it was fine.
5833720	5835720	But there was taxation without representation,
5835720	5838720	so we started to get ornery, so a bunch of the college-educated folk
5838720	5840720	got together in a place that had a broken bell.
5840720	5843720	Or they broke it later, and they said,
5843720	5845720	like, we should give tyranny or death
5845720	5847720	or give it to me that way in that order.
5847720	5852720	And then they did the Declaration of Independence,
5852720	5853720	and then England was like, you can't do that.
5853720	5855720	And they came over, and they had red coats,
5855720	5857720	and then we were like, we should fight dirty,
5857720	5859720	and two have led by land and one by sea.
5859720	5862720	And then we won because they were tired,
5862720	5867720	and King George was mad, and so they were fine.
5867720	5869720	Good luck having a country, whatever.
5869720	5870720	And then we were like, fine.
5870720	5872720	And then 1812 happened, and there was a war
5872720	5874720	that no one understands with Canada or something.
5874720	5878720	And then the whole time there were slaves,
5878720	5880720	the whole time we were just going to Africa and going,
5880720	5884720	these people seemed like they wouldn't know what fair pay was,
5884720	5887720	and we should use them to make stuff.
5887720	5889720	And they were like, okay, let's do it.
5889720	5890720	And they were like, how much am I bid for this?
5890720	5891720	And that was kind of fucked up,
5891720	5893720	and I don't want to dwell on this part, but...
5893720	5895720	No one ever does.
5895720	5903720	I got three minutes and 20 seconds left,
5903720	5905720	and we're almost done.
5905720	5911720	And then that one guy was a slave for 12 years,
5911720	5913720	and then he got free because of weapons.
5913720	5918720	And then Abraham Lincoln,
5919720	5923720	who I think some people say was half black,
5923720	5926720	but that's maybe a conspiracy theory,
5926720	5928720	but he was running for president,
5928720	5930720	and he was like, we should free the slaves.
5930720	5933720	And then there was a federalist movement,
5933720	5936720	and then the South States were like, you shouldn't do that.
5936720	5938720	We built the whole country on slavery,
5938720	5941720	and now you're saying you just want to use the pants we made
5941720	5943720	for free with the black people,
5943720	5945720	and then you want to read poetry in them,
5945720	5947720	and then just because you made a machine that can make pants now,
5947720	5948720	that's not fair.
5948720	5950720	We were like, we don't care, you're dumb,
5950720	5952720	and your teeth look dumb,
5952720	5955720	and let's go to war.
5955720	5958720	And then we fought,
5958720	5960720	and then Abe Lincoln halfway through the war was like,
5960720	5962720	by the way, the slaves are free.
5962720	5963720	And we were like, yay.
5963720	5965720	And then France was like, I'm going to do it too then
5965720	5967720	because I hate everything.
5967720	5970720	And then that's why we won,
5970720	5973720	or the North won, not we, the federalists won,
5973720	5974720	and then we unified the country,
5974720	5976720	and then Abe Lincoln got shot,
5976720	5980720	and then it was spending too long on that two-year period.
5980720	5982720	So then everything was fine,
5982720	5984720	and we ate potatoes and corn and stuff,
5984720	5986720	and then we made a bunch of smokestacks,
5986720	5989720	and then Henry Ford was like, what if you did pay people,
5989720	5992720	but if you paid them so little, they were basically slaves anyway,
5992720	5994720	and you made each person do one little thing,
5994720	5995720	and then you bought everything.
5995720	5996720	And then Thomas Edison was like,
5996720	5998720	what if I made a light bulb,
5998720	6000720	and some other guy was like, but I made the light bulb.
6000720	6004720	He's like, no.
6004720	6006720	And then everybody was making things for a while.
6006720	6008720	Everybody was making stuff,
6008720	6011720	and then because everybody was making things,
6011720	6014720	they knew how to put gunpowder into smaller compartments,
6014720	6016720	and so everybody was like, I can't wait to use these.
6016720	6018720	You can't use them, you know, because they're not in a war,
6018720	6019720	and everybody was like, I know, right?
6019720	6021720	Whoa, I want to use it.
6021720	6023720	And then Archduke Ferdinand was like, what happened?
6023720	6025720	And then somebody gets shot, and everybody was like,
6025720	6027720	that's a good enough reason for me.
6027720	6028720	I can't wait forever.
6028720	6030720	And everybody was like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
6030720	6031720	And they're like, mustard gas,
6031720	6032720	and shoot them in the kneecaps.
6032720	6033720	That way their friends have to help them,
6033720	6034720	and then you can shoot their kneecaps, too.
6034720	6037720	And it was like fucked up, and all quiet on the western front.
6037720	6038720	People were eating rats,
6038720	6040720	and they got whatever the precursor to AIDS was,
6040720	6041720	and everybody had herpes all over their face,
6041720	6044720	and if they could die at 35, they'd write nice poetry,
6044720	6045720	and it was kind of like nice quiet people.
6045720	6046720	They didn't talk about it.
6046720	6048720	They'd dig trenches everywhere at Verdun,
6048720	6050720	and then there was like peace for a while,
6050720	6052720	but not in Germany because everybody was like shitting on them.
6052720	6053720	They made them eat shit because they're like,
6053720	6055720	you should have to eat shit because you caused this.
6055720	6057720	And they're like, well, we're kind of sick of hearing that.
6057720	6059720	And then Hitler's like, Jews, am I right?
6059720	6061720	And they're like, yeah.
6061720	6062720	And then everybody was like, here we go again.
6062720	6065720	Except America was like, yeah, we'll be right with you.
6065720	6068720	Cash on the barrel head for bullets and oil.
6068720	6070720	And England was like, for real?
6070720	6072720	And we're like, yeah, you shouldn't have fucked with us in the first place.
6072720	6074720	You should have let us go back in 1612 or something.
6074720	6076720	And they're like, that's a fucked up weird justification,
6076720	6078720	but okay, we'll just hang out in the subway while they bomb us.
6078720	6079720	Hello?
6079720	6081720	And then we were like, and profit.
6081720	6082720	And we moved in.
6082720	6083720	We were like, we won the war.
6083720	6085720	You owe us a billion dollars.
6085720	6086720	And everyone was like, yay.
6086720	6087720	And we formed the United Nations.
6087720	6088720	We were like, planet America.
6088720	6089720	And everyone was like, that's great.
6089720	6091720	And we were like, the next 50 years is all planned out.
6091720	6094720	And then we just went 50 years, and everybody got better shoes and TV shows
6094720	6095720	and built skyscrapers.
6095720	6098720	And then meanwhile, the Middle East was like, what about us?
6098720	6099720	And we were like, we can't hear you.
6099720	6100720	Make us our oil.
6100720	6105720	And then they were like, well, not they, but like, you know, some of them.
6105720	6106720	Okay.
6106720	6107720	That's it.
6107720	6108720	That's where we are now.
6108720	6109720	That's my five minutes.
6109720	6117720	I don't know why you're, I mean, I know you're applauding that because it's a
6117720	6120720	thing that ended that lasted five minutes, but it wasn't a good deal.
6120720	6121720	It wasn't a good thing.
6121720	6122720	It's like, it really is.
6122720	6123720	It's not like I was rushing.
6123720	6125720	It's like, that was all the information I have.
6125720	6128720	Like, I don't really have, like, extra details.
6128720	6132720	Like, you know, like, Greg Proops knows stuff about Cleopatra and stuff.
6132720	6137720	She was from Iowa.
6137720	6138720	No, you do it.
6138720	6140720	No, okay.
6140720	6141720	No, I'm good.
6141720	6142720	Are you sad?
6142720	6143720	Are you sad?
6143720	6145720	You seem a little sad.
6145720	6146720	No, I'm good.
6146720	6147720	I'm good.
6147720	6148720	I'm fine.
6148720	6149720	Why?
6149720	6150720	I don't know.
6150720	6151720	You seem a little sad.
6151720	6152720	Just now?
6152720	6153720	Yeah.
6153720	6154720	I was like, you did it.
6154720	6155720	And you were like, no, I don't want to.
6155720	6156720	Well.
6156720	6157720	You wish the show was a little shorter.
6157720	6159720	Well, that was exhausting.
6159720	6164720	It's a big country.
6164720	6170720	Sure is, man.
6170720	6173720	On this episode of Friends.
6174720	6181720	You're going to bail out on our Thursday night hangout again?
6181720	6185720	You have a right to text me when we're...
6185720	6188720	Do you just wait for me to ask you if we're going to hang out on Thursdays?
6188720	6189720	No.
6189720	6191720	Steve Levy scheduled it.
6191720	6198720	It's like, comes up in my calendar saying, like, weekly hangout with Harmon.
6198720	6199720	Yeah.
6199720	6200720	Mine says Schwab.
6200720	6202720	Right.
6202720	6204720	And you bailed last week.
6204720	6208720	But to find that, I never even got a text from you.
6208720	6211720	Steve Levy told me, he said, Dan can't make it tonight.
6211720	6212720	And I said, okay.
6212720	6215720	I figured you guys are talking to each other.
6215720	6216720	Oh, shit.
6216720	6217720	Here comes Steve Levy.
6217720	6218720	Where is he?
6218720	6220720	What's up, Steve Levy?
6220720	6221720	Doesn't matter.
6221720	6223720	I mean, he might not be there.
6223720	6224720	So wait a minute.
6224720	6225720	Wait a minute.
6225720	6229720	You were available Thursday and you just found out now that you canceled?
6229720	6231720	No, I think it was something that I can't remember, but it doesn't matter.
6231720	6232720	Okay.
6232720	6235720	So we stretched until 10 p.m.
6235720	6237720	It was Cody's family came to town.
6237720	6238720	Cody's family came to town.
6238720	6239720	We had dinner.
6239720	6240720	Oh, yeah.
6240720	6241720	Yeah.
6241720	6242720	I went out with Cody's family.
6242720	6243720	Okay.
6243720	6244720	That's where that chandelier picture was.
6244720	6245720	Okay.
6245720	6246720	Great.
6246720	6247720	Moving on.
6247720	6248720	We lost Annie.
6248720	6249720	She's out of here.
6249720	6250720	Are you going to bail?
6250720	6254720	She left her, she left a purse, though, so.
6254720	6255720	Yeah.
6255720	6256720	Open the purse.
6256720	6258720	Open the purse.
6258720	6259720	Open it.
6259720	6260720	Open it.
6261720	6264720	Annie's going to go to her much publicized blog.
6264720	6267720	Open Taking Shits at Harmon Town.
6267720	6271720	A look from the can at the cans and cannots.
6271720	6274720	Don't look in the purse.
6274720	6278720	Reach in and grab the first thing.
6278720	6279720	And then read it.
6279720	6282720	That is totally okay.
6282720	6284720	I don't actually know that Annie's taking a shit.
6284720	6285720	That's an invasion of her privacy.
6285720	6287720	It could be a peepee, a cigarette.
6287720	6288720	She might vape.
6288720	6289720	We don't know.
6289720	6291720	She could be a crime fighter.
6291720	6292720	What's it say?
6292720	6293720	What's it say?
6293720	6294720	Oh, it's a phone.
6294720	6295720	What does it say?
6295720	6296720	Are you going through her shit?
6296720	6297720	You're her friend, right?
6297720	6298720	Are you her friend?
6298720	6300720	Well, Rob told her to.
6300720	6301720	Okay.
6301720	6302720	Well, don't go through people's shit.
6302720	6303720	All right.
6303720	6304720	It is.
6304720	6305720	What?
6305720	6306720	No, we can't play D&D.
6306720	6307720	Yeah.
6307720	6308720	Let's bring out Jeff.
6308720	6312720	Maybe next week we'll think about it.
6312720	6313720	I said the same thing.
6313720	6316720	It's like next week we'll decide.
6316720	6317720	Why don't you play?
6317720	6319720	I don't know how many shows Jeff's going to miss.
6319720	6322720	Why don't you play Dragons and Dungeons?
6322720	6323720	All right.
6323720	6333720	Well, you know, let's do a quality, concise, goodbye rap for our first show here.
6333720	6336720	Let's make it good.
6336720	6338720	Let's try to make it good.
6338720	6346720	And jump in there because you're better at it and that's not racist.
6346720	6348720	It's based on friendship.
6348720	6350720	It's not a snap judgment I'm making.
6350720	6352720	You're very good at it.
6352720	6353720	Thanks, sir.
6353720	6354720	I have to jump in there.
6354720	6355720	I have to pee so bad.
6355720	6358720	Well, will Shrob be joining us as well?
6358720	6375720	Shrob's going to come in with samples from various films and television.
6405720	6410720	A microphone.
6410720	6422720	In the rap game, I am known as all alone because I don't spend a lot of time on my name.
6422720	6425720	Because rhyming is the majority of my game.
6425720	6428720	I don't believe in self-promotion.
6428720	6430720	I only believe in the rapping motion.
6430720	6432720	I like to move my lips and my little tiny tongue.
6432720	6434720	I fucked your mama so hard she became a nun.
6434720	6435720	Uh-uh.
6435720	6437720	Afterward.
6437720	6439720	Not because she was traumatized.
6439720	6445720	I like to think I spiritualized her pussy with my dick and gave each titty a lick.
6445720	6447720	And when I did, it was a trinity.
6447720	6449720	And I fucked her so hard she wants more of me.
6449720	6457720	So I'm going over there next Wednesday, as my dad would say.
6457720	6458720	Take it.
6458720	6459720	I don't know if I can beat that.
6459720	6462720	I beat your moms with a baseball bat.
6462720	6465720	Next Wednesday, Tuesday, we getting down, got her on her knee.
6465720	6467720	No more fucking mamas.
6467720	6468720	No more fucking mamas.
6468720	6469720	No more.
6469720	6471720	Mamas need a lot of respect.
6471720	6473720	Mama wrote you the damn first check.
6473720	6477720	Mama gave you your first kiss on your lips.
6477720	6479720	You used to hug your mom round the hips.
6479720	6489720	Mama, stay in school and drink your milk.
6489720	6491720	No more fucking mama.
6491720	6493720	No more fucking mamas.
6493720	6495720	No more fucking mamas.
6495720	6497720	Because Mama needs her respect.
6497720	6499720	Outer space.
6499720	6501720	On the moon.
6501720	6503720	Don't fuck your mama.
6503720	6505720	It's cocoon.
6505720	6509720	All the old people come with me.
6509720	6513720	Go to a place with one sixth gravity.
6513720	6516720	Gonna bounce around when we don't fuck your mama.
6516720	6522720	Gonna ride with Yamaha scooters.
6522720	6524720	Face in your face.
6524720	6526720	Mustard on your plates.
6526720	6528720	Hot dogs in your hands.
6528720	6530720	Everybody join my bands.
6530720	6532720	I'm gonna fly a pie.
6532720	6534720	Gonna fuck your mama like pie.
6534720	6535720	No, I'm not.
6535720	6536720	Wait a minute.
6536720	6537720	Nope, sorry.
6537720	6538720	You got to back off.
6538720	6540720	We had an agreement.
6540720	6541720	I thought we wouldn't.
6541720	6542720	Fucking mamas no more.
6542720	6544720	It was written in the cement.
6545720	6547720	Maybe we can do it just for the dads tonight.
6547720	6548720	Fuck a dad tonight.
6548720	6550720	Make everything not alright.
6550720	6552720	Fuck your dad tonight.
6552720	6554720	Time to fuck dads.
6554720	6556720	I took your dad out.
6556720	6558720	I took your dad out.
6558720	6564720	I took your dad out and I danced with him.
6564720	6567720	Did you fuck the dad in the tight black socks?
6567720	6569720	Yes I did.
6569720	6571720	Yes I did.
6571720	6574720	Did you fuck the dad as he tried to mow the lawn?
6574720	6576720	Yes I did.
6576720	6579720	Yes I did.
6579720	6581720	Did you fuck a dad to the break of dawn?
6581720	6582720	To the break of dawn?
6582720	6586720	I did.
6586720	6588720	Did you fuck the dad even though he had a bad back?
6588720	6589720	Bad back?
6589720	6590720	Bad back?
6590720	6592720	Yes I did.
6592720	6594720	Yes I did.
6594720	6598720	Did you fuck the dad and that's why you dance like that to this track?
6598720	6600720	Yes I did.
6600720	6601720	Yes it is.
6601720	6603720	Maybe the audience can do the dad dance.
6603720	6605720	Maybe the audience can do the dad dance.
6605720	6610720	Let me see you shake your dad's hands.
6610720	6612720	Just put your fists like this.
6612720	6616720	90 degrees to your elbows.
6616720	6622720	Somebody's gonna get grounded.
6622720	6623720	Shake it to the left.
6623720	6624720	Shake it to the right.
6624720	6626720	Get up on lawn tonight.
6626720	6627720	Go into the street.
6627720	6628720	Turn off the lights.
6628720	6631720	Not paying to light everybody.
6631720	6635720	Where's my cake, Medelia?
6635720	6637720	It's Father's Day.
6637720	6639720	Creepshow.
6639720	6642720	I want my cake, Medelia.
6642720	6645720	Where's my cake?
6645720	6647720	Health insurance.
6647720	6649720	Single payer.
6649720	6652720	You got me this tie last year.
6652720	6654720	You got me this tie last year.
6654720	6660720	You should accept that I'm queer.
6660720	6663720	And stop buying stock in John Deere.
6663720	6673720	Because they fund Breitbart.
6673720	6675720	I assume.
6675720	6677720	You probably don't.
6677720	6678720	I don't think that's defamation.
6678720	6682720	I'm sure a snowblower company probably advertises on Breitbart.
6682720	6685720	Hey, don't fuck your dad.
6685720	6686720	Hold on.
6686720	6687720	Sorry.
6687720	6688720	Just give me a second.
6688720	6689720	Sorry.
6689720	6690720	We're running late tonight.
6690720	6692720	Hey, don't fuck your mom.
6692720	6694720	Fuck your dad all night long.
6694720	6695720	Move it to the left.
6695720	6696720	Move it to the right.
6696720	6698720	What a lazy rap tonight.
6698720	6700720	Like they're always good.
6700720	6702720	Fuck your dad like a piece of wood.
6702720	6703720	I went up his butt.
6703720	6704720	Came out his mouth.
6704720	6705720	Went in his ear.
6705720	6707720	And went down south to his pubic area.
6707720	6708720	Gave it a lick.
6708720	6710720	Moved up his balls to the tip of his dick.
6710720	6712720	Put it in my mouth until he came.
6712720	6715720	Then I won the game called Daddy Fucking.
6715720	6716720	Don't pass go.
6716720	6719720	Give $200, you know, to blow your dad.
6719720	6720720	To Geronimo.
6720720	6723720	Blows his cum like a volcano into my tummy.
6723720	6724720	Yum, yum, yummy.
6724720	6725720	Gonna poop it out.
6725720	6729720	And then play gin rummy with your dad.
6729720	6730720	All right.
6730720	6731720	That's good enough, man.
6731720	6732720	All right.
6732720	6733720	All right.
6733720	6737720	That has been Home and Town.
6737720	6739720	Club Schwab, ladies and gentlemen.
6740720	6743720	Spencer Crichton.
6743720	6744720	Dan Harmon.
6744720	6747720	I've been your guest comptroller.
6747720	6749720	Brandon Johnson.
6749720	6751720	We all love microwaves.
6751720	6754720	We all love microwaves.
6754720	6755720	Crisper off.
6755720	6756720	Steve Levy.
6756720	6758720	Kevin Day.
6758720	6760720	Zach McKeever is back there.
6760720	6762720	Making sure all the equipment is good.
6762720	6764720	Oh, maybe I should turn that off.
6764720	6765720	No, just let that ride out.
6765720	6766720	Let that ride out.
6766720	6768720	Yeah.
6769720	6770720	Yeah.
6770720	6771720	All right.
6771720	6772720	Fine.
6772720	6773720	He's got to go to the bathroom.
6773720	6774720	Thanks for coming.
6774720	6775720	We'll see you.
6775720	6776720	We'll see you next week.
6777720	6778720	Yeah!
6796720	6798720	Did you get any of that?
6798720	6800720	It's a good show.
6800720	6801720	Bye-bye.
6801720	6803720	Bye-bye.
