0	14840	Thank you all for coming from MacArthur Park, Los Angeles, somewhere near downtown L.A.
14840	16240	on a Monday night.
16240	21360	Harman Town is now in session.
21360	39400	Let's bring out the game master, Spencer Crittenden, and your mayor, Dan Harmon.
39400	50440	Oh no, coming in hot.
50440	55320	What the hell is going on?
55320	56320	Nothing.
56320	65320	This is my natural posture and I'm not sucking anything in.
66320	71320	I felt like I had a little bit of a cheeseburger slide in New York.
71320	72320	Oh, sorry.
72320	73320	Hip hop.
73320	79320	Oh, you've got to stop eating like a piece of shit if you want to be beating your weight
79320	80320	into submission.
80320	84320	I fucked your mama with my nocturnal emissions.
84320	86320	Autopilot, they call it.
86320	94320	I fucked her without even trying and then I'm bored with your mama sexually.
95320	96320	Oh, damn.
96320	97320	Wow.
97320	102320	It took over 300 episodes for you to finally...
102320	106320	Finally tire of that.
106320	108320	Honeymoon's over.
108320	111960	You and their mama had a pretty good run, I've got to say.
111960	117320	It was the longest relationship with anything or any job or automobile.
117320	123400	I've never committed to anything longer than I have your mama.
123400	130400	I wonder how many times you've fucked the mamas to the north and to the south.
130400	132400	I don't know.
132400	133400	Three or four.
133400	138400	It seems like the kind of thing, and I wouldn't want to cause busy work for this person, but
138400	143400	I don't want to trigger any kind of disorder that needs to not be triggered for someone
143400	148480	to be happy, but it seems like the kind of thing that someone on the internet would just
148480	152880	go through and they would give us an accurate count on how many times the phrase fuck your
153880	154880	mama has been said.
154880	155880	What do you think it would be?
155880	157880	Take a jelly bean jar count.
157880	159880	Just saying fuck your mama?
159880	160880	Yeah.
160880	161880	Oh, God.
161880	167880	I would say 1,700 times.
167880	170880	It might be more than that.
170880	174880	It might be like a price is right, bidder's row, low ball.
174880	178880	You're going to say 1701 and fucking win and get up there.
178880	179880	We won't go prices, right?
179880	181880	We'll go distance from absolute.
181880	182880	I'm guessing 1,700.
182880	185880	I'm going to say 1,500.
185880	190880	Anybody here have the aptitude for that sort of thing that they think they know the aptitude
190880	191880	for guessing?
191880	192880	No, no, no.
192880	193880	Somebody.
193880	194880	Autism.
194880	195880	Autism.
195880	198880	Does anyone hear of autism?
198880	203880	Does anybody have to think that they would think much higher, a much lower number?
203880	205880	It's got to be less than 300.
205880	208880	It's got to be less than 300?
208880	209880	Yeah.
209880	210880	You really think an episode's gone by?
210880	218440	So let's say if you've wrapped half the episodes and in three-quarter of those you've mentioned
218440	222720	it at all, then that's what, like 40% of the episodes.
222720	227200	So you would have to fuck them to the north and to the south three times per wrap.
227200	228200	No, Dan is saying.
228200	229200	No, no.
229200	230200	We're talking about just fuck your mama's not north and south.
230200	231200	Oh, I thought you...
231200	232200	Okay.
232200	234880	So I thought this was about fucking them both in the north and the south.
234880	236880	Look, I want all these numbers.
236880	237880	Easily 2,000.
237880	239880	I want to get all these numbers.
240880	241880	Huh?
241880	242880	No, no.
242880	243880	This is different.
243880	244880	But Dan...
244880	247880	That's why I didn't want to pollute this with the...
247880	249880	But these are the right questions.
249880	252880	I just wanted to start with a baseline of how many...
252880	255880	Yeah, because you'll fuck like seven mamas in one wrap.
255880	256880	Right.
256880	257880	Then 300.
257880	260880	If I wrap for two minutes, that's going to be...
260880	261880	At least 20.
261880	266880	My guess is an average of five times per the number of episodes just because some episodes.
266880	267880	Sure.
267880	268880	Maybe I don't wrap at all.
268880	269880	That's fair.
269880	271880	But then it's like it is my crutch.
271880	275880	The only time I've done away with it would be the Mike Eagle episode.
275880	278880	And I probably did it 17 times otherwise.
278880	279880	Yeah.
279880	280880	Yeah.
280880	281880	So I'm going to say...
281880	282880	Actually, you know what?
282880	283880	I think 1,500 is way too low.
283880	284880	I think you're right.
284880	285880	I'm going to go 1,700.
285880	286880	I'm going to go 1,900.
286880	287880	Okay.
287880	288880	I want to go...
288880	289880	Okay.
289880	290880	So who knows who can count that?
290880	291880	Maybe somebody can...
291880	292880	These days they have...
292880	295880	The last time I checked, they had avid plug-ins.
295880	297880	This was still when I was working on Community.
298880	301880	I think Yahoo season...
302880	305880	Avid had this plug-in that...
305880	307880	I can't remember what it was called, but it's...
307880	314880	You can type in a word like butterfly, and it would go through all of the footage in
314880	320880	the bins and bring up clips marked, and it would be like Donald Glover saying butterfly.
320880	322880	Chevy Chase saying butterfly.
322880	327920	You type in the word, and it would voice recognize without having to do it in real
327920	328920	time.
328920	334560	It would just go scrub through all of the data instantly and bring up a list sorted
334560	338680	by relevance or whatever, like close...
338680	343200	And at the top of the list, it was just like, holy shit, this is everyone saying butterfly.
343200	348200	And then there would be a steep drop down to people saying, you know, give me a piece
348200	351640	of peanut butter pie or something.
352640	354640	Which is also useful if you were trying...
354640	359640	If you were gonna edit a fucking mix or something, and now you'd have a thing that rhymes
359640	360640	with butterfly.
361640	362640	Peanut butter pie.
362640	364640	I thought that was just incredible.
365640	366640	Editing is...
366640	372640	Obviously, we don't wear little white gloves and spliced tape anymore, but beyond that
372640	375640	leap to the digital, there really hasn't been...
375640	379640	There's been so few things that actually make it a faster thing to edit, which has always
379640	387640	been this sort of Promethean hybrid of engineering and artistry editing.
388640	393640	And the idea that an AI could just be like, no, no, no, I'll pull up all those takes where
393640	399640	they got their line right or whatever, which used to be the domain of man.
401640	405640	And that is an intentionally exclusive statement.
405640	407640	Only male editors can...
410640	422640	Speaking of progress, Stan Lee has progressed off of the mortal realm.
422640	423640	His mission accomplished...
423640	425640	Was he 94 years old?
425640	426640	95.
426640	427640	What a life.
427640	428640	Did you meet him?
428640	433640	I met him, but it was like I met him in a line.
433640	434640	A lot of Comic-Con or something.
434640	435640	Yeah.
435640	436640	You weren't there for that?
436640	437640	No.
437640	438640	Okay.
438640	439640	Yeah, that was a Rick and Morty thing.
439640	440640	Me and Justin got...
440640	445640	We went to Kamikaze, Stan Lee's Kamikaze, and got to...
445640	451640	He signed a thing, and it wasn't really like, come party with Stan Lee.
451640	454640	But, you know...
454640	457640	Were you a fan of the DC stuff, or...?
459640	463640	I don't really care about that stuff at all, anyway.
464640	465640	I'm tired.
465640	471640	But it's objectively notable that in...
471640	474640	I mean, Stan Lee was obviously...
474640	475640	I mean, wow, what a...
475640	478640	It's just sort of interesting to...
478640	480640	Not only is it a...
480640	487640	Not only is it like, oh, we have him to thank for a bunch of shit that we've been talking about for the last 25 years alone.
488640	493640	But the idea of living a life so complete that in your...
493640	498640	Way past your 80th year, which if I make it past 80, I'm gonna be like...
498640	501640	I just imagine myself, all I'll be doing is...
501640	509640	It will be all pharmaceutical-based, and paperwork, and getting sued, or whatever you do past 80.
509640	515640	They're just fighting for the right to just sort of squat on Terra firmer.
516640	519640	But in his...
519640	522640	I mean, he got to watch the...
522640	531640	The thing that in your biopic usually just has to happen in that, like, one paragraph after the person that the biopic's about dies, you know?
531640	534640	Charlie Chaplin goes away, and then the paragraph says...
534640	538640	Now, today, he's taught in universities, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
538640	544640	And you always have that feeling of, oh, that's a little sad, I wish Picasso or so-and-so could have been there for that part.
545640	549640	It was kind of neat. He got to...
549640	554640	Pretty sure he left, like, well after the credits of his biopic.
554640	560640	He's probably like, you know what? If I stick around for 10 more minutes, something awful's gonna happen.
560640	563640	He really nailed that landing.
563640	566640	You don't think he was murdered?
566640	569640	Well, there was a little... There was right at the end there.
569640	574640	There was a little weird fracas, kind of something about him suing his manager, or somebody...
574640	576640	There was some kind of odd...
576640	578640	I don't know.
578640	581640	I hope it was a legitimate...
581640	584640	Wait, so he was suing his nurse, and then he just conveniently dies?
584640	586640	Uh-oh.
586640	587640	I don't even...
587640	589640	Reported here first.
589640	592640	Harmontown exclusive scoop.
592640	600640	It's weird that he didn't really do any of the comics or Fantastic Four or any of the comics he got known to for until he was 40 years old.
600640	608640	So it's not just like, oh, he was like an intrepid young cartoon. He was like a 40-year-old man, and then his life started.
608640	611640	Yeah, that's good. I'm glad you pointed that out.
611640	614640	Because it's like, what can we learn from people?
614640	619640	Because otherwise the message becomes as bland as like, oh, I hope I get to do stuff.
619640	621640	That must have been nice for him.
621640	622640	Right.
622640	632640	But yeah, a lot of people email me, or hopefully a lot of people don't have my email, but Tumblr messages and whatever.
632640	633640	Most of them.
633640	636640	People that slide into my DMs or whatever.
636640	647640	There's a theme among the things that people ask me called, am I too old to try to start doing what you're doing?
647640	653640	If I've been up until now a plumber or an exterminator or a bicycle thief.
653640	661640	And of course we know that fashionably you're supposed to say, absolutely not, you're never too old.
661640	669640	But I actually believe that you have to start when you're 20. No, I'm kidding.
669640	673640	No, I mean, I truly believe it's so important to keep that in mind.
673640	679640	And it's such a great example because he was basically, it's like, hey, guess what?
679640	681640	The TV writing business got sued for it.
681640	683640	And I don't know if they even cleaned up their act.
683640	684640	There's ageism.
684640	689640	Like in existing industries, these existing channels, let the kids ask, how do I do it?
689640	690640	How did they do it yesterday?
690640	702640	But the blessing and curse of maybe feeling like you're too long in the tooth to strike out and do something is that you almost got no choice but to carve out your own niche.
702640	703640	But absolutely.
703640	705640	I mean, it's like he's not known for that.
705640	714640	It's not like it's not like his eulogy on ABC News today is going to be known as the late starter Stanley.
714640	723640	But yeah, I mean, it probably was a huge factor in his life that he had to think about all the time from 32 to 40.
723640	725640	You know, like, what the fuck am I doing?
725640	732640	How many times do you think he maybe thought, why am I drawing sequential pictures of a guy climbing a wall?
732640	733640	I just never got it.
733640	734640	I got to stop this.
734640	739640	This is not going to go anywhere other than the wall.
739640	740640	Do we have shrubs?
740640	741640	I don't know.
741640	742640	No, it's his birthday.
742640	743640	Why would you come here?
743640	744640	Happy birthday.
744640	745640	Happy birthday.
745640	747640	Happy birthday, Shrob.
749640	750640	Oh, yeah.
750640	751640	He's still not here, though.
751640	752640	I know.
752640	753640	I love the Rob Shrob.
753640	754640	I'm glad he's not here on his birthday.
754640	756640	That would be incredibly depressing.
756640	757640	You also invited him.
757640	761640	I did, but I'm glad he did not heap that call.
761640	767640	Well, he invited on the chance that the truth would be more depressing.
767640	770640	He's happy to find out that he had something better to do.
770640	771640	Yeah.
772640	773640	What do they say?
774640	779640	Pray for sunshine, prepare for rain?
780640	781640	I think that.
781640	782640	I don't know.
782640	783640	I think I coined it.
785640	786640	How much did New York experience?
786640	791640	There's a story that happened in New York that it's going to drop on the next episode after this one.
791640	792640	Oh, really?
792640	793640	Yeah.
793640	801640	It's going to come out during the week we're off around Thanksgiving because things went a little hairy on the way to New York City.
801640	802640	And not what they're recording.
802640	803640	Yeah.
803640	804640	Like they're recording.
804640	816640	I talked about we talked about nothing but because I said in New York, I said, look, we're either going to if we talk and we start talking about our trip to New York where that'll be the entire 90 minute show.
816640	823640	Let's just say I became Joey Ramone and Cody became Sid and Nancy.
824640	828640	Joey Ramone was famously known for falling asleep outside.
829640	832640	We were over served as the headline.
832640	834640	You got to check out the episode.
834640	836640	It'll be a really good one.
837640	839640	We know you guys are famous for listening to the podcast.
839640	840640	I'm still so ashamed of myself.
840640	841640	It was the worst.
842640	843640	Yeah.
843640	854640	But and I think I was real drunk when I said it, but I babbled a little bit at the end because I didn't want it to just be a maypole dance around people getting drunk and having embarrassing things happen to them.
855640	872640	You know, I want I I I don't want to repeat myself for that episode, but I just but this is going to be a recurring theme now after going through a year of like sorting through a bunch of shit like my new thing is like got to be vulnerable.
872640	873640	Got to be honest.
873640	874640	Got to be transparent.
874640	875640	Got to.
875640	892640	Got to just even even though there is this increasing pressure from a reaction chamber, this this this world that we're voluntarily are not transitioning into or becoming these digital creatures and we can't have that digital world be a place of shame that can't rule the day.
892640	896640	Did you guys see this the Trumpy Bear and thing?
896640	897640	Yeah.
897640	898640	Trumpy Bear.
899640	900640	Do it.
901640	905640	So no, then there was this ad aired on Fox News for Trumpy Bear.
905640	907640	It seemed like it was a joke.
907640	911640	It was like it could have been an onion produced commercial for Trumpy Bear.
911640	914640	It had the unmistakable tone, a little bit of a sketch.
914640	920640	Even the act like even the the onscreen actors that were like using it just seemed like they were doing it as a joke.
920640	924640	It has a black blanket inside of it.
924640	932640	So you can comb and you can pull out an American flag blanket out of its tummy and curl up with Trumpy Bear.
932640	934640	And it comes with a certificate.
934640	937640	And there's a dude on a motorcycle like a big like Harley's Angel.
937640	938640	Harley's Angel.
938640	939640	Yeah.
939640	943640	He's a Hell's Angel Harley guy driving around with a teddy bear talking about.
943640	947640	Trumpy Bear is my bro or something.
947640	948640	Yeah.
948640	949640	And it seems like a joke.
949640	951640	Have we verified that it's for real?
951640	952640	No.
952640	953640	We've just mused idly about it.
953640	969640	The reason I bring it up is because I looked at it and I was like my sincere optimistic hope here is that this is Nathan Fielder or John Oliver like that we're going to find out a couple of months from now.
969640	970640	But who knows?
970640	978640	There's someone or someone doing that because if it is that's that's ingenious because.
978640	992640	And then that kind of made me realize how much we need that whether this is that or not like that is my continued frustration that that to the extent that you view our country as being in any kind of like battle between two sides.
992640	1004640	Your choice if you don't want to see it that way I understand that you're a Harmon town audience and I've been that guy for more longer than I've been this pick a side guy wouldn't force anything on you.
1004640	1023640	But if you do perceive this kind of like two sided thing it's the next thing you might perceive to your frustration is that when did when did we if we are the left when did we when did we become the the ones that aren't funny.
1023640	1036640	Like because that's how we started for sure like there is nothing funny or smart about about the views that are that are that are held by that other side.
1036640	1046640	Therefore what a crime it is that they're the trolls that they're the they're the ones doing the bits and the practical jokes and the stunts and it's like they've it's like come.
1046640	1066640	We got to we got to get that that scepter back where we should we should be having orgies in the street and making jokes that they don't understand and high fiving each other for being misunderstood and understandable and and we should be able to stand side by side with with with people that we don't even get.
1066640	1086640	But we know that we want them to have a right to not be gotten and and to the point where the only way to be on that other side is to be either silent and ashamed or loud and embarrassing to those other people that are silent and and that's that's that's where you want your your foes.
1086640	1105640	Otherwise you're just a wash in this thing that then our our beautiful you know kind of somewhere caught in the middle people they get they get that luxury of going like I don't see any difference between you guys and that's when we lose big time you lose that big giant middle of people that are like I'm tired of this shit.
1105640	1130640	I'm tired of listening to mom and dad bitch at each other I don't I don't I can't see any difference between you you you're both just so ashamed of yourselves and afraid of each other and trying to convince somebody of something that's not true and you're you're both lying and you're both politicking and it's like our great revolutions and our great victories against fascism have always come down to how can you fight organic freedom?
1130640	1152640	How can you fight sexuality? How can you fight poetry? How can you fight humor? How can you fight music? There's nothing to get your hands around there's no throat there but yeah it's a culture war. We got it we got those socialist gritty memes now though. That's like the first positive step we've taken ever.
1153640	1179640	But I think it would be amazing and relatively hard it wouldn't be dirty combat to be like hey here's this this this Trumpy bear and I make make them all buy a thing then reveal to them three months later that all of that money went to black scholarships or abortions or whatever and and and and then on time and then they have to like take it down from the gun rack in their bar and either burn it but it's got an American flag in it.
1180640	1197640	Isn't there a like a like a little caveat and the thing that there's a little there's a disclaimer people were pointing out and there's another website or whatever because but it's a real thing but the question is is it a real thing that's kind of a cynically jovial right thing which wouldn't be the first time I mean they've gotten.
1198640	1218640	So hard to tell who's kidding they saw mugs and shit but but it's like it's either that or it's it but it does say there's like this there's like this very specific caveat about you can't return this damaged and it's sort of like I don't know see that's it's gotta be it's gotta be a graft a put on a Trojan bear.
1219640	1236640	This is no if you watch the app truly the the actors do seem like they're kind of like trying to be like almost jokey if not not I don't know it's really rides the line they're having a good time but if it let's say it's let's say it's real they're going to sell a lot of those Trump.
1237640	1260640	There's certain yeah well you don't want to have on the television if you're going to sell it still they'd be stupid to not sell a million Trumpy bears and use that money no they're definitely selling something you can't just put on a TV it costs a lot of money Jeff yeah how am I going to make how much does a Trumpy bear go for Spencer do you know two two payments of nineteen ninety five two payments two payments.
1261640	1265640	And like a build a bear as well like thirty bucks twenty bucks okay I don't know.
1267640	1272640	Levy pointed out that we have yet to talk about Red Dead Redemption to yeah no shit Levy.
1273640	1281640	They brought to mind this this text message exchange that I just had with Cody today now before I go into this I really want you to understand that I have.
1282640	1296640	I'm one of the people who thinks this is a masterpiece of a video game so I know how I know how flamed up we get about our video game culture like it makes makes that was a good movie that was a bad movie look like a fucking.
1297640	1303640	Civil War reenactment compared to Vietnam like like like the way that people are like you're wrong it's a bad game.
1304640	1323640	So I feel like the need to disclaim this and go I'm a fan of the game because I was just I was just doing a bit for myself with because Cody sent me a tweet a picture of a tweet from a guy that's that tweeted gave up on Red Dead Redemption to because I couldn't figure out which horse was mine fuck this game.
1323640	1332640	So I texted Cody back all he has to do is whistle and his horse would walk up to him fuck that guy.
1333640	1347640	Yeah I just learned you can like put you can tie someone up and put him on the back of their own horse and then or no put on the back of your horse then get on their horse and ride their horse and whistle for your horse to follow behind you and then you can carry a deer on the back of your horse too.
1348640	1351640	Yeah everyone wins except for the person.
1352640	1361640	Is there a button that says whistle oh yeah there's a button it's the you know the button that says whistle don't you just use a button that puts your lips together the button that blows.
1362640	1378640	Yeah that was a nice that was a nice to have enough not reference a reference so old that we we we get it because because if it survived this this many stands and storms we all know it's not like yeah okay.
1379640	1391640	So how many buttons we got in this thing if there's a whistle button on the control there's a controller there's like 90 fucking buttons so Cody made the mistake of typing ha ha now I got a nickel in me and I.
1396640	1406640	Well what a provocative asshole she is no no that's why I texted the reason he should give up is because it takes five attempts to stand in front of a biscuit the way that lets you pick it up yeah.
1408640	1417640	And she texted ha okay I go back to sleep come cuddle soon Harvey saving your spot for you which is her saying you know enough so I kind of like I was like it'd be funny if I kept going.
1421640	1429640	He should give up because the missions require you to slaughter entire towns but if you accidentally press the fart button while you're tipping your hat your honor goes down and ammunition costs more.
1430640	1447640	He should give up because if if you kill a man that tries to kill you and another man sees you do it you have to run and make the third man pinky swear not to share his experience with his family over dinner because if you just kill him the price of bacon goes up and if you just ignore him he instantly tells the world you're a murderer and that means you have to go to the post office.
1448640	1466640	It's true yeah these sound like bits I don't know if you can buy bacon in the game that's the only thing that's not true I tried to pick up a dead person's hat and I put it on it was like this hat will not be saved this is not your default hat and I was like you told me to pick up the hat.
1467640	1486640	There's almost only one reason he shouldn't give up on Red Dead Redemption 2 and that reason is because you can't find your horse you can only find your horse in that game it's a mind reading homing horse that can teleport to the bottom of cliffs here are some things that are harder to find than your horse in Red Dead Redemption 2.
1487640	1514640	Your clothes, your friends, your objectives, a satchel with room for more than nine things, a way to survive without carrying nine pieces of food, a bowl of stew, your own left leg while taking a bath, the guy that keeps moaning in the hotel in the town of Valentine, a way to fuck any of the 20 sex workers in the saloon that compulsively ask you if you want some company every time you walk by them.
1515640	1532640	Interactions with random men that don't force you to choose between beating the fuck out of them or walking away while they call you a pussy, treasure maps that function more like maps than Pictionary with an autistic child, a way to win a gunfight with more than two men that doesn't involve running away and sneaking back seven times.
1533640	1553640	Any recourse whatsoever to role playing is anything other than a sad, drunk, confused, psychotic, wobbling through mud, slurring at everyone or hiding in the wilderness mutilating animals in the pathetic hope that if you cut enough skin off enough deer you might be able to pick up enough motor function to walk from one end of a room to the other without accidentally dying or killing.
1554640	1558640	Well now I want to go home and play some more because I just remembered how awesome this game is.
1559640	1561640	It's good.
1563640	1566640	Ha, ha, ha, ha. Okay, come home now please.
1567640	1570640	I gotta work more, sorry. I did, I had to work more.
1571640	1572640	Did you?
1572640	1574640	Well, not as hard as I did on that.
1576640	1591640	I had this, like one of the last things I did, because the game kind of puts these random events in front of you, and so these two law men are pulling a wagon with a prisoner, and just between you and me, the prisoner is like an older black woman.
1592640	1596640	And she's saying, like, I didn't do it, I didn't do anything, I'm innocent.
1596640	1600640	And so I'm like, well, the game is telling me I gotta save this lady.
1600640	1608640	And so I sneak up on him, and I shoot him both in the head, and I'm trying to hide the bodies because, you know, I don't want to go get in trouble.
1608640	1613640	And so then another cop comes, and I shoot him, and then I'm like, well, I'm just gonna let this lady out and run away.
1613640	1619640	And then, so then three more cops come, and I get a big firefight, and I kill like four horses on accident, and so a whole nightmare.
1619640	1621640	I have like a $40 bounty on my head.
1621640	1625640	And then I finally let the old lady out, and she's like, thank you so much.
1625640	1630640	By the way, Sonny, there's this old turnip farm down south that you can rob.
1630640	1632640	And I was like, what the fuck?
1632640	1636640	All these missions, there's a whole robbery opportunity.
1636640	1638640	You know what it's weird?
1638640	1641640	Because I was never confused in a Grand Theft Auto game.
1641640	1642640	No.
1642640	1643640	Because...
1643640	1644640	Everyone sucks.
1644640	1645640	Right.
1645640	1660640	And that was arguably, you know, it's hard, culturally, let alone with gaming as the fucking epicenter of this, like, crazy cultural, like, fucking teacup ride that we've been on.
1660640	1668640	But, you know, obviously, like, Rockstar Games and Grand Theft Auto was like this thing where it was like, hey, it's gaming, it's its own medium.
1668640	1679640	Not only are we not accountable to standards and practices, we're not accountable to, like, any, like, construct of morality that even the individual human might have.
1679640	1686640	Which, you know, I understand why people would get alarmed of that later being encroached upon.
1686640	1715640	I don't know how much thought the people that get mad put into it, but I do remember going, boy, this is really actually very valuable latitude to have in a medium in a world where we're such a successful first world empire that our television shows, even though they've progressed from someone's got to keep their foot on the floor, or if they're in the bedroom together, to being able to look at two people wearing pajamas in a bed next to each other.
1715640	1738640	Like, you know, let's, you know, we're in danger of stagnation when we get successful and our media becomes another product like eggs on a shelf that's like so safe and so policed that, you know, you get conditioned to react to restrictive thought, or anomalous thought with, you know, pulling back.
1738640	1755640	That's all. So so I remember playing Grand Theft Auto three and being like, this is valuable. I mean, it's cynical. It's awful. It's so cynical. Right. But it's so it's a it's it's valuable that it's expansive and well being so fucking poisonous.
1755640	1775640	And it's equally poisonous to absolutely everything about society. Right. Exactly. And it's consistent. And it was just sort of like, you know, it was that whole like freedom of speech is way more fucking important than than anything, because through that, if you lose that, you're certainly fucked, no matter how good you think you are as a society.
1775640	1794640	And and and I mean, that's a that's so long ago now. And it's weird to think of it as long ago, because that game was so relatively like, I just still think of it as like, a recent accomplishment that this Grand Theft Auto three represented this like gigantic kind of leap forward and sandbox open world gaming.
1795640	1819640	And it's so anyways, but then I don't even want to comment because it's such a minefield of like, how then we keep making Grand Theft Auto games and and like, even better ones through an era where like, you know, this gamer gate shit starts happening and people are having these conversations about what what what cultures are we promoting?
1819640	1830640	And why are you mad? Why are you mad? Why are you mad? What are you trying to protect? I'm not trying to protect anyway. Are you trying to attack it? I didn't attack anything. Why are you trying to keep everything the same? I'm not trying to keep shit the same. I want them. She's a slut.
1831640	1849640	The but it's amazing to me that that that that you know, it's it's like they had the Old West version of Grand Theft Auto at Dead Redemption. And then this is seven years in the making the sequel to that to that game. And it's just so it's it's interesting to look at the tightrope that they're walking.
1849640	1851640	The complete difference in like morals.
1851640	1864640	But I think it's a little confusing because I oh, it's very confusing. I wouldn't want them to, you know what the most moral thing you could do in Red Dead Redemption is shooting people in the foot and then tying them up and leaving them in the bushes.
1864640	1875640	That's completely legal. No one will ever follow you for doing that. What is the come up the come up? It's like if you get caught by the Oh, you have to pay $40 to the post office. You go to the post office and you pay your thing.
1875640	1904640	In Grand Theft Auto, you're always in a car. You do something wrong. You get a wanted you get wanted stars. And the fun of it is if you you know, you got one goal like a little kid playing tag or something, you know, you gotta you have these paint shops around town is basically one of one of only a few ways that you can if you can during a during a high speed chase, even if you it keeps increasing in stars.
1904640	1926640	So the more stars you're wanted, the more levels of law enforcement come out. So you eventually it's helicopters and SWAT teams and tanks and the National Guard comes to get you and and at any point you can just pull into a spray shop and have your car instantly spray painted and when you pull out as long as you don't bump anybody on the backing out, you're you're free again.
1926640	1955640	They're not they can't find you. Your car is a different color. Now, obviously, that's ridiculous. However, if you look at it from a gaming mechanic standpoint, it's actually hard to emulate that in the Old West under any circumstances. You can't just go get your horse, your horse painted and it somehow works a little better. But my point is, I don't think it's really an internal logic issue. I think it's that I think it's a game design issue. I mean, I well, I think it's like, I think it's like they're great at making these games. I think that part of them being great at making games.
1955640	1983640	And then being great at making games is that they have this sort of almost it's ingrained in there because I see the same names in the credits. There's you know, it's not like a new generation of of people taking over and a brand. We see the same names of designers and stuff. And it's like, I think that they it probably goes hand in hand being able to make such a crazy open world sandbox game and having a mind that's probably pretty allergic to the concept of putting things on rails, especially morally.
1984640	2006640	However, you got to admit that Red Dead Redemption 2 certainly in a game set in the Old West with multiracial characters and a bunch of women in it. There's a notable absence of of the the degrees of depth in the moral sense that the game goes to compare.
2007640	2011640	I can't name examples off hand, but you just kind of sense it. You're like, well, you know,
2011640	2035640	it kind of just tries to slam in your face that, like, no matter what you are, you're kind of the bad guys. And I don't know, which is the point of it. And to me, I keep getting confused, I think because of that. I think because there's like a it's like, oh, if I could just get it through my head that it's Grand Theft Auto on a fucking horse and stop. But I keep being told by the game that it's horrible when you do bad things, though, unlike in Grand Theft Auto.
2035640	2050640	It feels very empty. But at this, it's like, I don't know. Someone's like, how are you doing? And then you like step on her foot in the horse and she's like, yeah, it just like it feels. It's like, oh, no, I got to reload my save. Like, it feels horrible to do anything wrong in this game. We're in Grand Theft Auto. It's kind of like, ha ha.
2050640	2079640	Also, the sophistication. It's like, it's a it's a the mechanics are like, it's a it's a it's a great thing. You can like walk and you pull the left trigger when you see somebody in context when he comes up. So you can kind of experience these things like you walk by, they say random things. And you got you got your binary option of or I guess triple option because you can you can diffuse antagonize or greet. But the the upshot is that you can walk in real time and almost kind of like marionette a real person.
2079640	2108640	In terms of like verbal encounters with strangers. If that's your jam, if you what you want is immersiveness. So you experience walking and and just howdy. Hey, fuck yourself. Hey, you don't got to be like that. Keep watching. And you're like, you're kind of like all of these things are not like times not stopping. And you don't have to like, you know, load this and do that. And and that's really cool. But the the downside of that is if you're really immersed in this world, you're watching.
2108640	2137640	And people are constantly saying, I don't like the looks in your face. And I'm like, and all you can do is tie him up and toss him in a bush. It's like, it's like, you know, from a gaming perspective, that there's no profit in stopping and doing anything with this person. It's like so immersive now that I'm like, I'm the guy that it took it took it took so long to go bisexual and fall out. You know, because I I just like it.
2137640	2151640	I just like I have this like, I'm like, I it's part of my I think my clinical narcissism is that you can really get me into a game and I and tell me that, you know, that's me. And then I'll take that really serious. You can't be bisexual in Red Dead.
2151640	2165640	Well, I don't know. You can't even have sex with the sex workers. Yeah, he doesn't seem to be into women. One thing I was confused by. You said one of the hard things to do in in Red Dead Redemption 2 is you can't find your left leg in a bathtub.
2165640	2180640	Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a real thing. You take a bath. Sometimes you have to pay 50 cents to do that. If you go and take a bath, then after you finish washing your head, there's a knock on the door and a woman says, would you like would you like some help in there? And if you pay 50 cents, a woman will come in.
2180640	2194640	And this goes to this kind of labyrinthine. There's no game to it, right? No, you just press. You just press any number of buttons that you want to indicate what part of your body you want washed. And then there's an option to make small talk while you're doing it.
2194640	2208640	And she responds with, you know, algorithmically. And she I was like, oh, it's it's like it's eventually this is you're going to unlock a hand job or something. That's what it leads you to believe. But I don't know. After the first one, I was like, this just seems like a red herring to me.
2208640	2221640	It's really weird. But then again, that's what I mean, Grand Theft Auto was kind of they let it leak that there was a way to get a sex worker in your car. Oh, that's different. I was thinking it's like an automatic thing.
2222640	2237640	Anyways, but there's no there's no funny business, no sex happening in the game. Not unless you assume something's happening under the water that is both instantaneous and that he has a poker face about it because he's that he's a cowboy and he doesn't want to.
2237640	2250640	But in a lot of the interactions, it sets up that he's kind of just not interested in anyone who expressed it. Let's spread a rumor that he's gay. Well, I mean, yeah, who knows? He might be. But he certainly doesn't seem into it. He pisses people off.
2250640	2270640	He's an asexual cowboy. It's great. That would be a huge advantage in the Old West, I think, to be asexual. That's that's true. Because he's always having to go after like women and haul them into prison and stuff. You know, you can't be be seductive or, you know, I have asexual questions.
2270640	2286640	Is anybody openly asexual? Also, is that a thing? Like, like, or is it a thing? Yeah. Are you I'm not even gonna make eye contact because I don't want to put you on the spot if you don't want to be put on the spot. Are you are you are you self applying that that phrase? Oh, okay.
2287640	2299640	But yeah, if anybody if anybody if anybody's like, like, confidently, like, yeah, I'm asexual, that's what I identify as. I'd love to have a conversation with you if you don't mind. Especially if you're also a cowboy, some naive.
2299640	2315640	That would be great. That would be it. But I would consider it a fucking asexual cowboy podcast dynamite. You know, if you're, if you're, if you really follow the code of what we understand to be the true cowboy,
2315640	2336640	you would be asexual, wouldn't you? Well, why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Okay, cowboys. True cowboys have sex with land jinnies. You just want bisexuality to get, you know, signal boosted in any context.
2336640	2340640	You're like, you're like that guy at every protest that has the legalized weed.
2340640	2354640	I think like the a lot of cowboys when they because they always leave at the end, you know, like Shane or you know, like, they write off in the sense that they're like, they're like, bye bye, sexual, like, bye, bye.
2354640	2357640	Yeah. Thank you.
2357640	2370640	It is kind of defined, at least in the silver screen terms is like, you know, I mean, one of the major foundations is for sure, unless you're a bad guy, you don't, you don't, you don't cross boundaries with an unwilling filly.
2370640	2389640	You know, like you, you're certainly not maybe regarding women as equals in a society governed by reason, but that's a lot of that's not your fault as a cowboy, you're just you're just a cowboy, but you, but but you definitely are, you know, you're not, you're never
2389640	2396640	you wouldn't be a good cowboy if you if you took liberties. Right.
2396640	2404640	What'd you say? Water world? Water world by contrast.
2404640	2411640	Even even in childhood, women are nothing more than maps to dry land.
2411640	2414640	Something to draw upon.
2414640	2440640	But there isn't a lot of Westerns because there was there were small cast small sets and usually not a lot of women characters because for a lot of reasons, but one that actresses were expensive, like to get a big star like like like, you know, Hollywood starlet in the thing that in the same way, kind of like in Die Hard, there's there's often scenes in in westerns where the bad guy and the good guy meet and it's almost flirtatious.
2440640	2441640	It's kind of like this. Right.
2441640	2452640	Where there's kind of a sexual vibe to it. Like in Shane with Jack Palms, when he sees Alan Ladd, like he kind of checks him out and it's kind of like it's it's almost a little like sexy.
2452640	2462640	Well, definitely. I mean, they certainly land that in Westworld with Yul Brynner and what's his name? I mean, it's like like even though he's a robot pretending to be a bad guy, Richard Benjamin, very sexual.
2462640	2468640	It's one. It's one actor with no eyebrows. Another actor who's just 90 percent eyebrows.
2468640	2477640	Why don't you go home to your mama? That movie sucks. It starts off great. It starts off so good.
2477640	2488640	Why are we in Rome now? Like they go to like it's just I just love the idea of the rumor in that movie, the way that you can tell these these these robots that you can have sex with that look like.
2488640	2494640	So we'll look at their hands, though. They can't. Science can't recreate the poem.
2494640	2500640	The fingertips are all weird. That's how we felt in the 70s. We felt like, well, we're going to we're going to get there.
2500640	2505640	You know, you see these Halloween masks this year? They're pretty, but they're getting that guy looks a lot like Nixon.
2505640	2512640	And we just kind of I think we thought like, yeah, you know, that hand that we were like, we were all intelligent design people.
2512640	2517640	We were like, how do you how do you ever make a fake hand? It's a robot. It's going to have claws.
2517640	2524640	We can make a guy look just like your runner. Yeah, I rewatch that with church.
2524640	2529640	Speaking of Hollywood and the 70s and weird things, here's a podcast recommend.
2529640	2540640	I there's an Australian podcast called Fatal Voyage. It's a reexamination of Natalie Wood's death.
2540640	2550640	I guess that I guess that I guess I guess it was technically reopened or something like because the captain that was on the boat.
2550640	2556640	For those of you who don't know Natalie Wood, she was a West Side Story, incredibly famous actor.
2556640	2562640	She she married for a second time. Robert Wagner, who's still alive.
2562640	2566640	He was in this show called Heart to Heart. And before that, he was a movie star.
2566640	2574640	They had a, you know, they then Natalie Wood was in a movie called Brainstorm with Christopher Walken.
2574640	2582640	For some reason, this is the part that really confuses Schwab a lot more than it does me, because I've always I've always equated Christopher Walken with you.
2582640	2586640	Like, I always why.
2586640	2593640	And I imagine coming off of the Deer Hunter and having an Oscar like, like, like, like, Schwab, Schwab just can't get his mind around.
2593640	2601640	It's like, why? Who invites Christopher Walken alone onto a boat to Catalina and just hand it?
2601640	2604640	And I'm like, doesn't it seem like something Jeff would just be like, Natalie Wood?
2604640	2609640	I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Anything you want me to ask her?
2609640	2614640	And that you wouldn't drink a date. Is that how I sound?
2614640	2626640	I had to make you sound different for me.
2626640	2629640	OK.
2629640	2638640	And but anyways, but just I mean, for those who are totally unindoctrinated to this sort of like legendary kind of Hollywood Babylon thing, Natalie Wood drowned that weekend.
2638640	2644640	And it was like there were there were four people on the boat, including the captain.
2644640	2649640	And one of them ended up dead. And there was never it was it was never really regarded as a homicide.
2649640	2655640	And so all this time, it's always just been this thing of like something fucked up, went on on that boat.
2655640	2665640	And there's there was always the I always I always thought it was very silly and kind of provincial of people to go.
2665640	2673640	Well, the two automatic courses are like obviously it's like he was a jealous kind of husband in a jealousy streak.
2673640	2677640	He once followed Warren Beatty home with a gun because she was in a movie with him.
2677640	2682640	And he was like, you know, he's he's he's capable of going there in jealous jealousy.
2682640	2687640	So obviously that's a big predictor for serious male violence and murder.
2687640	2692640	It's obviously the first place you'd go in a regular even regular death as you look at the husband first,
2692640	2697640	if he's the only one capable of being near you and there's a history there.
2697640	2702640	And there's four people on the boat. So there's the captain, Christopher Walken, the guy and the girl.
2702640	2705640	Right. OK. And I always thought that that always makes sense to me.
2705640	2711640	But I always thought it was like a very kind of Midwestern Holly looking at Hollywood thing that people would go,
2711640	2715640	you know, what really happened is Robert Wagner was fucking Christopher Walken.
2715640	2718640	Natalie Wood walked in and she was like, that's it.
2718640	2720640	And they clubbed her to death and threw her in the water.
2720640	2726640	I'm like, why do we why do we just because that's the only other scenario that you can imagine?
2726640	2729640	And it's like, oh, Hollywood's bisexual and all this stuff.
2729640	2733640	But and then I'm going to turn this podcast over to you so I don't want to spoil everything.
2733640	2737640	But it does turn out that Robert Wagner, he was married to Natalie Wood twice.
2737640	2745640	And the reason they got divorced the first time is because she caught him in an affair with a man.
2745640	2749640	And so that doesn't automatically mean you're going to fuck Christopher Walken.
2749640	2754640	I'm connecting those dots. But I was I was surprised to find that out and was like, holy shit.
2754640	2759640	But I said, but yeah. And so I if we were to continue to talk about it, I tell you what was the podcast.
2759640	2762640	It's called Fatal Voyage.
2762640	2766640	It's just like one of those like one off kind of mini. Hell yeah. That sounds awesome.
2766640	2768640	You know what I think.
2768640	2781640	It's another one called the RFK tapes, I think these are all Cody finds these and we sleep to podcasts.
2781640	2784640	But I think it's called the RFK tapes. RFK something.
2784640	2794640	It's a it's a it's a it's a reexamination of the assassination of Robert Kennedy by this like weird guy, sir.
2794640	2811640	And a really fascinating, like intimate examination of a really nice, smart, cool guy who is absolutely convinced that this is an elaborate conspiracy.
2811640	2815640	And he doesn't have tinfoil on his head. He doesn't. He's not defensive.
2815640	2818640	He doesn't hurt throwing things. If you say you think he's full of shit.
2818640	2833640	So it's like very it's a it's and yet what he's but what he believes is is the case is so, you know, hard to believe, you know, but it's it's it's fun.
2833640	2839640	It's fun to listen to for a couple of episodes. I mean, the couple being its totality.
2839640	2845640	I don't mean it takes a shit in the middle.
2845640	2852640	Yeah, I like to come to harm in town and get my recommendations for other podcasts.
2852640	2864640	If you if you haven't listened to heavyweight ever and I go to Trader Joe's to get coupons to Ralph's.
2864640	2868640	Our friend Rob Cordry was on this show. It's a it's a it's a good entry point if you don't have any other.
2868640	2872640	There's this there's a show called heavyweight. It's got no I can't remember the guy's name.
2872640	2879640	John Goldstein or something like that. But it's a network gimlet gimlet media.
2879640	2883640	He's he's this guy and just like gets up in other people's business.
2883640	2890640	So if you have a I think it's called heavyweight because it's usually deals with shit that's like weighed on people for for a while.
2890640	2897640	And it's been unresolved. And then he'll just like you'll people come to him and say, you know, I haven't spoken to my aunt in 30 years.
2897640	2900640	And I'm convinced it's because she thinks I'm racist or whatever.
2900640	2904640	You know, we had an argument over pretzels at this lake house or whatever.
2904640	2909640	And I just can't talk to her. And, you know, I get these mixed signals and all this stuff and then he'll just call her.
2909640	2920640	And like he just kind of like realized at some point in his life that the only thing he was good at was, you know, resolving getting his nose and everybody's business.
2920640	2924640	Yeah. Does he fix it or he? Yeah, no, he very much does. Yeah.
2925640	2927640	Otherwise he would be a horrible person.
2928640	2929640	Sounds like a Red Dead redemption.
2929640	2939640	He's got a very high resolution rate, even when it sometimes it turns out that the person that thought that their issue was with someone else, it turns out that they need to confront something about themselves and he'll successfully get that.
2939640	2942640	All right. So you're you're you're Red Dead. You're walking around.
2942640	2944640	Somebody calls you an asshole. You step on their foot.
2944640	2947640	They scream in you what button physically.
2947640	2949640	How do you tie somebody up?
2949640	2952640	What's the interface that you use a rope to tie somebody?
2952640	2956640	Well, first, Jeff, you'd hold down the L B button to bring up your weapon wheel.
2956640	2959640	OK. Hopefully you have your laptop equipped already.
2959640	2962640	Yeah. Hopefully you loaded that out for when you got off your horse.
2962640	2967640	Or you're on your horse and you use the control stick to select it.
2967640	2976640	And then now you have your now you have your rope equipped and then you hold down the R trigger, I think, and the L trigger to aim and swing it around.
2976640	2980640	Oh, man, you're aiming and you let it go by letting go the trigger.
2980640	2985640	And then I think you then immediately have to hit the trigger again to hold on to it.
2985640	2990640	Otherwise, when you tie them up, you will immediately let them go and they will get up and run away.
2990640	2998640	But if you hold the trigger and you hold them tied up and then you could slowly walk to them and hog tie them with the B button.
2998640	3000640	Or thank you very much, Spencer.
3000640	3004640	Yeah, my first bounty was that black widow lady.
3004640	3006640	That's why it's good to be asexual in that game.
3006640	3008640	I was. Well, think of what she'd pull.
3008640	3012640	I wasn't tempted to do anything, but what I would say she tries. She tries to tempt you.
3012640	3017640	Well, I know, but I'm not. She's. Yeah, because. Yeah. But I think I got my lasso out.
3017640	3019640	I was like, I'm not. I'm not having any conversation with this person.
3019640	3026640	I'm right. I successfully lassoed her from my horse, but then getting off my horse, I let go of the rope.
3026640	3032640	She got up and just immediately just it was like a nightmare. She came up. Oh, yeah, started slashing me with a knife.
3032640	3037640	I owe that. And then I just did what I always do. I ran. Right.
3037640	3041640	I spent so much of that game just running off into the wilderness.
3041640	3050640	If you if you if you if you come back around in a big circle while while they slowly forget I ever existed and go back to join what they were doing.
3050640	3054640	If you if you if you lasso somebody but don't hold down the trigger once they're lassoed, do they get up and run away?
3054640	3060640	Yeah, it's like you've essentially ripped them. But now you've also lost your rope. No, no, you have infinite rope for some reason.
3060640	3066640	Yeah, infinite rope. Oh, yeah, it's great. Rope indeed. Yeah, no, but I that same exact thing happened to me.
3066640	3072640	And then she like slashed me like four times and I was almost dead and I like ran off 15 feet and then tied her up.
3072640	3079640	It was great. You really that's that's the only thing you could do in this game is tie people up.
3079640	3085640	It's amazing. It sounds it sounds terrible. Yeah, you could also shoot animals.
3085640	3094640	It's a gorgeous game. I mean, it's really like the combination of the kind of the dedication of some team over there because I remember Grand Theft Auto five came out.
3094640	3105640	Is that the one where you're Russian? I think four. I remember there was a kind of like I think there's you know, there's people you can imagine there's probably camps that are like we need to make this thing look fucking gorgeous and have all these details.
3105640	3115640	And you should be able to have a cell phone and farm potatoes and that there are times that those teams are the enemy of a good game because you're just like just make it a little better than San Andreas.
3115640	3125640	And we all would have been so happy. But then I think this game represents that camp getting getting getting to have their day in court.
3126640	3135640	The technology is here. The screens are 4k. The boxes can run it like let's make it be photorealistic. No cut scenes.
3135640	3143640	They try so hard for there to never be any transition to anything. So you're just like walking through saloon doors and then you're in the saloon until you leave.
3143640	3150640	And there's never any loading or anything. Well, there is some loading. I don't don't don't write letters.
3150640	3159640	There's no guests. My feet are tired. I usually don't sit down until there's a guest. Nova, do you do you do you want to come up? Are you tired of being exploited?
3159640	3162640	Okay, our guest Nova.
3169640	3175640	Can I just quickly give a plug? We still need some audience members for Wednesday to Friday.
3175640	3183640	So if you guys want a free show sometime this week, come come to Harmon quest tapings, Harmon quest dot com for tickets. Oh, yeah, we're doing that in a couple of days.
3183640	3194640	Yeah, Saturday and Sunday, I think are full. But we really we really could use some more people. They're free seats, I think. So Wednesday to Friday this week, if you guys are just Wednesday.
3194640	3202640	I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna get my haircut by the person that's job was job is supposedly only to comb my hair. Oh, no.
3203640	3217640	I'm sure they're stoked about that. Yeah, so I get paid the same, but I have to touch your fucking gross are we doing like any kind of meeting, have a meeting before this or am I just showing up to the thing in two days and we're just going to start bone we will limit again.
3217640	3223640	I'd love to talk to you. I don't know when Aaron's showing up. But yeah, I mean, we should do that. Absolutely. We should do a lot of things to prepare.
3223640	3234640	I kind of it really caught me off guard. I was thinking among many things that that that ex-wife Aaron McGathey would buy before we were taping that she would probably pop by the show and yeah, and reconnoiter with the audience.
3234640	3249640	Hello. Hello. Sorry, Nova. No, no problem. How are you doing? Good. Why? That seemed that seemed a little equivocal. No, I'm just I don't know. I'm in a weird mood. But, um, yeah, I've been good.
3250640	3263640	Yeah, well, I'm so old. Fair enough. When I'm in a weird mood, I usually find that when people pester me about it and make me explain makes you normal, right? That just evens it out.
3263640	3276640	That it well, it usually leads to me being so desperate to feel something that I'll even exaggerate shit. And it'll be a conversation that ends with the person going, Jesus Christ. Well, God, feel better.
3277640	3286640	Well, you kept asking me how I was. I had to make something up. Oh, but is your weird mood there? Do those still waters actually run deep?
3288640	3304640	Yeah, I'm I don't know. I'm in a weird place right now because I'm I don't want to talk forever or anything. But yeah, I've been trying to get down my anxiety. So I've started meditating and then that's great. Yeah.
3304640	3318640	By the way, when has anyone on the show ever gotten away with talking anywhere near forever except me? That's true. Yeah. No, I'll be interrupted if I talk too much. That's good. You'll be interrupted if you're sharing like a really deeply personal thing. I'll be like, well, let me tell you about that. Yeah.
3319640	3332640	And I'm going to try to like eat better and more regularly and I'm going to try to start exercising and hopefully that'll bring my anxiety down and I'll be able to function better. It hasn't destroyed my anxiety, but it has helped somewhat to exercise. So I hope you get some relief from that.
3332640	3361640	I think it'll be good. Yeah, especially like the meditation and it's kind of that and then I'm I'm happy and I'm doing things I like and I'm starting to relax. But then there's also like I'm having all these existential crises and I'm upset about all the awful things happening, which usually I never pay attention to. But lately, it's really hit me bad. And so it's this weird kind of I'm just having a weird kind of time at home, kind of having existential crises and feeling bad and then kind of like finding how to make it okay.
3362640	3386640	And kind of having fun and stuff. So yeah, at home, I know you're quite young and you living you living with the folks. Yeah. And but I you're you're stop me if I don't I only know so much about you. And I assume none of it is things that you don't want me to blurt into a microphone, but you your your dad picked you up from the show.
3387640	3402640	He just he drops you off. He doesn't come in to watch. He's just like, Go watch that podcast. Yeah, he drops me off. Yeah. He works from home. So he can pick up his stuff and work at a coffee shop or anywhere and he likes to get out of the house. So it's it's good for both of us. He definitely doesn't mind it.
3402640	3404640	Do you mind talking about the situation at home?
3404640	3405640	Sure.
3405640	3409640	Is it is it is it an anxiety inducing right now?
3409640	3418640	Oh, no, I just kind of I've realized I've been well, yeah, if we can if we want to get deep, if that's fine.
3418640	3423640	What do you think these people are craving? I just talked about other people's podcasts for 40 minutes.
3423640	3428640	So there needs to be bloodshed or they're gonna be like, I want my eight $10 back.
3429640	3439640	Well, yeah, I mean, life has been weird for a while. I am in senior year. I went into like a half homeschool program that turned out to be the worst thing for me because there was no structure.
3439640	3451640	So I barely graduated and should have gone full homeschool. That's a joke at the expense of our public school system. No, I should have definitely stayed.
3452640	3456640	That's a real criticism of her parents homeschooling ability.
3456640	3461640	No, because it was on me because it was a half homeschool program where the students kind of decided their own curriculums almost.
3461640	3466640	And a lot of them did really well because they were kind of different kind of kids and a lot of them are geniuses and stuff.
3466640	3473640	But for me, it did not work. I needed structure. And yeah, you mean a lot of these programs typically go well because you're referring to other kids.
3473640	3478640	No, I just meant mine. I don't know about other ones, but homeschool can be really good for certain people.
3479640	3488640	Yeah, usually kids that are like they could be two grades ahead or they're really, really interested in a super specific thing and really good at it or things like that.
3488640	3493640	Do you have recourse to therapy? Are you in any kind of therapy?
3493640	3499640	Yeah, I've been in therapy for like two years. Well, I've been in and out of therapy since I was like a kid.
3499640	3505640	That person probably tells you not to blame yourself for like a lot, right?
3505640	3514640	Yes. Yeah, I get guilty about kind of like being the way I am or something or I kind of used to.
3514640	3519640	And she tries to tell me like, no, it makes sense why you are how you are. And it doesn't matter anyway.
3519640	3527640	I try to sometimes I'll be like, why is this thing about me? And great grammar. And she'll be like, it doesn't matter.
3527640	3534640	All that matters is that it's like hearing what we do about it. And if we accept it or if we try to get rid of it or whatever, it doesn't matter how or why.
3534640	3539640	Things are the way they are. Yeah, that's a very religious question.
3539640	3546640	Oh, I guess it's kind of exist. Yeah. Why am I having this problem? Like, yeah, that is really existential. I thought about that a lot.
3546640	3555640	Yeah, I think that aspect of modern therapy that there's been a swing into the focus on the concept of happiness and that like that.
3555640	3562640	My therapist is constantly saying because I'll accidentally ask her like, like, I don't know, should I do this or should I do that?
3562640	3568640	Or some kind of question that's more subjective and she'll go, look, I don't know. I'm your mechanic. I'm here to make you happy. Oh, interesting.
3568640	3576640	Right. Like, it's like, it's like, like, like that's the goal is for me to be happy, not for me to be a good person necessarily.
3576640	3587640	Although those things tend to go hand in hand, because if you have a definition of good person and you achieve it, you're probably going to be happier than if you live in defiance of your concept of goodness.
3587640	3594640	Yeah, well, that's my thing, too, is that I have extremely high moral standards just for myself, not even for anybody other than myself.
3594640	3605640	But despite the fact that I don't think I come anywhere close to meeting those or even other people's standards, I'm constantly told all the time, mostly by my therapist, that I'm too hard on myself and that I'm too critical.
3605640	3614640	And I'm like, really? Are you sure? Like, you know, are you sure I shouldn't be harder on myself even than I am? And she's just like, no.
3614640	3625640	But yeah, what was I gonna? Oh, yeah, for me, it's usually pretty much everything I've ever had that I brought into therapy has been like, it's okay, though.
3625640	3634640	Like, you know, it's not that big a deal or kind of like, and not in a fake way, but really just like, no, that's fine. Like, it's okay. Or I don't know.
3634640	3641640	I almost detect a tone in your voice. It's like, if you're like me, that's a little dissatisfying. You want some good wills to get hunted.
3642640	3656640	Yes, you want you want you want epiphanies? You want to do dramatic work? I know it was crazy. Yeah, I spent a lot I did what my first 10 therapists I would very often pull out the insult challenge was like, look, I've been here three times.
3656640	3659640	Like, what do you get paid to do? I'm still fucking crazy.
3659640	3669640	You know, yeah, what my problem is, is that I'm extremely self aware. So I'll go into therapists and I'll explain all these things about myself. And you know, I think it could be caused by this thing. And I think this might be a way to fix it and blah, blah, blah.
3669640	3682640	And I'm like, and people are noticing this about me. And that's not the way I was. And therapists are just like, I don't know. I don't know what to do. Yeah, that's why my current therapist is really good. And I don't know. She's very honest, as far as I can tell, at least.
3684640	3686640	We're very good at being dishonest.
3687640	3709640	Exactly. What did she do for for all our therapists listening? What did she do? What was like a moment when you were like, okay, you're off the chopping block, or okay, I'm gonna maybe come up or down to your level, but in any case, like work with you a little bit here as opposed to like, when is this bitch gonna help me kind of?
3710640	3717640	At first, I thought she was kind of too hard on me sometimes, even though, again, I think I'm part of myself and other people are hard on me. I'm still like, well, don't do that. You know?
3718640	3738640	Well, that's yeah, I mean, don't call me out on that. I mean, Sarah Silverman was the first person to point that out to me. She was like, like, self loathing, self loving, like, it's about you. And like, like, nobody's more defensive than someone at self loathing. You're like, I'm just a poopy pants and someone goes like, well, you do have a little bit of poop in your pants. And you're like, you're a fucking asshole.
3739640	3768640	Like, you're all the more outraged. You're like, I just shot myself and you're shooting me through the hole. Exactly. Exactly. It's outrageous. Yeah, I think I at first, I thought maybe she was a little bit too much of a person that was very blunt. And I don't know, didn't want to like, sugarcoat or whatever. And it's like, I don't know. I like people to be nice. I like people to be genuine. But when it's like a therapist, I don't like if they're like, kind of hard on me. And I think she got to a point where she is still like that. And she doesn't sugarcoat.
3769640	3787640	things. But she's learned that I respond to positivity and not negativity. So she's kind of just learned who I am and what I need, you know, and that some people need to be like, they need to have a kick in the butt, you know, but then some people need to have a little hope of like, you can do it, you know, like, it kind of, it really depends on the person, what's going to actually motivate you.
3787640	3809640	I think I think my therapist, there was the threshold for me was when it was finally set out loud. Because I, you know, I, when it comes to drinking, everybody else other than me is a square, like, like, they're not, they don't have, they don't understand what I understand about, about drinking my relationship with it.
3809640	3829640	It's not and I don't I get nervous when squares get into that territory. And then I get nervous about getting nervous about getting nervous because squares react to you getting nervous about the subject of you drinking the way that they've read on the Milton Bradley box for playing talk to an alcoholic.
3829640	3854640	That's just like denials the first line. And it's like, yeah, okay. So like, and I decided, and then you get nervous about it. And like, it just took a really long time of cat and mouse with her bringing up my drinking, where I was like, on one hand, not willing to talk about it with her, but on the other hand, not willing to not be willing to talk about it.
3854640	3871640	Because I didn't want to fuel either of those furnaces. And, and then there was just some crucial conversation we had where I she, she, maybe she finally figured it out that what she needed to do was promise me that she was never going to ask me to stop drinking, which you would think would be a horrible thing to do.
3871640	3900640	Because you either have to stop or you don't. But it because she finally said that I've now had so many more conversations about something that's so fundamental to my psychology, which is my relationship with self medication, than I ever would have with anybody who no matter how noble their purpose was just going to take a position of like, well, let's talk about you drink it. And she finally, you know, just like, like, like a cowboy coming up to a spooked horse, you know, she finds like, just like the horse needs to know you're not going to throw a saddle on it. And she's like, I'm not going to throw a saddle on it.
3900640	3921640	Throw a saddle on it, which you are. But you know, it's like, like, Dave Klein's not here, is he? Because otherwise, there would have been seven ups by now. Nope. But Dave, Dave, Dave Klein, my physical therapist, if you will, like the guy that comes and watches me do tummy crunches.
3922640	3931640	Well, that's a pretty pejorative description of my occupation. I did the guy that the guy that makes me do tummy crunches. But like, early on, was that me again?
3931640	3960640	Early on, there was a there was a lot of like, weird, because I Instagram live all of it. And there's, so there's probably an archive of it where like, I was like, so like, that was like this control freak barrier. Like, I don't want another person being able to come into my home, and just tell me to do more sit ups if I feel like I've done enough. It's like, it just like, it hits this, like, I don't know.
3961640	3987640	It hits this nerve, not laziness. But but something beyond that, where it's like, I think it goes back to just being afraid on the playground of like, guys that were good at football or something like that. But anyways, like, it now that I think about it, it's like the exact same thing, I trust is so powerful and rare. Yeah, I just got to a point in therapy.
3987640	4017640	I just got to a point in therapy, where it's, it's like, there's so much shit that was like, such a sink full of dishes to do that I was so unenthused about. And like, can we get to this fundamental stuff? And it's like, no, you're gonna get you can't can't do that stuff. There's fucking macaroni stuck to this tray. Yes, it's been there forever. Yes, you don't think it's important. But let's, let's soak this shit. And I'll have blah, blah, blah. And I finally now just started to have conversations with him. And he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like
4017640	4039200	he's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, I'm just like, have you heard of like America? You haven't heard of that before. Like the salt squ
4040640	4046240	now they're kind of like, you know, they're like, they're all stuck. But like, I don't know. And I'm just like, I, I I'm there. I'm not
4046240	4049140	I don't have these friendships that I see portrayed
4049140	4051500	in movies and television, let alone described
4051500	4054160	in Hallmark cards, but I also don't know
4054160	4059160	if those are real, but like, I don't, it's like, trust.
4059320	4064320	Like, I don't want anybody to be able to, like, hurt me.
4065560	4067600	It's very generic sounding stuff,
4067600	4071160	but like, it's so fucking profound to me.
4071160	4073900	Like, I can't, just like, Spencer and I were talking
4073900	4075580	about this when we were walking in New York.
4076500	4078340	Yeah, Dan also talks about that a lot
4078340	4080220	on the podcast that comes out next time.
4080220	4081860	I think it was a really valuable thing.
4081860	4084580	Not that this podcast is therefore worthless.
4084580	4085420	No, this one's better.
4085420	4086500	I think this was money well spent.
4086500	4088780	I think it's good you guys drove to a bad neighborhood.
4088780	4089940	Yeah, thanks so much.
4092060	4094780	I just, how do you, because Spencer
4094780	4096220	kind of spontaneously offered me
4096220	4097660	while we were walking and talking about it.
4097660	4102660	He had this, like, you know, odd, personal,
4103260	4105620	visual metaphor for his heart.
4105620	4106940	Like a mental image.
4106940	4108460	And he was like, I know it's weird,
4108460	4110180	but I see my heart like this, and I was like,
4110180	4113580	oh, no, I see my heart in an incredibly specific way too.
4113580	4117580	Do you have a image in your head of how your heart works?
4117580	4119500	Maybe sometimes I think about it.
4119500	4121740	I think more how my brain works.
4121740	4124300	But like, when people hurt your feelings and stuff.
4125700	4127860	Like, the way, yeah, the paths in and out,
4127860	4131580	like, if you pictured, like, your feelings
4131620	4134140	as being, like, in the center of your chest.
4134140	4135420	And then, like, you had to, like,
4135420	4137900	draw a picture with crayons of, like,
4137900	4140060	how it works mechanically.
4140060	4143180	Not pumping blood, but, like, letting things in and out.
4143180	4145340	Like, letting feelings, whatever.
4145340	4147860	Is there, like, an image that comes to mind?
4147860	4148700	Works at all?
4148700	4150340	Mine's a spiky clam shell.
4151580	4153620	Like, cloister from Pokemon.
4154980	4156300	With a heart in the middle.
4158340	4160220	But it used withdraw already.
4161700	4163060	In order to give you time to think,
4163060	4167860	I will, not to satisfy my fetish for talking over people.
4167860	4171140	I will do mine, and then you can,
4171140	4172940	maybe if you want to take a whack at yours.
4172940	4176580	But I just, it's been a bit, like,
4176580	4178900	I've always just had this very clear image
4178900	4183180	of this very steampunk iron orb.
4183180	4186580	With rivets and, like, it's just,
4186580	4191580	it's just absolutely, proudly, defiantly sealed off.
4193060	4196780	But powerful, and that it can, you know,
4196780	4199580	there's very specific channels coming out of it
4199580	4203100	that go out of that, completely out of its vicinity,
4203100	4206780	because the power that's coming out of it
4206780	4209140	has no place around it.
4209140	4212740	That would be really foolish architecture.
4212740	4216860	And so it carries things as far away as possible,
4216860	4219020	where they can be used and processed
4219020	4220940	and help other people.
4220940	4224020	But the real key is that if you're standing near it,
4224020	4227300	there's no fucking way you're gonna get anything but burnt
4227300	4232300	or scalded or, you know, it's like a point of pride
4232700	4235260	how inaccessible it is, because it's like,
4235260	4237620	there's this feeling in my head of, like,
4237620	4239740	that I took me all this time to re-examine,
4239740	4242620	where I'm like, that's how it should be.
4243140	4243980	It should be proud of that.
4243980	4245540	It's like playing a tower defense game,
4245540	4250260	like, oh, look, my inventory, you can't get near it.
4250260	4251460	You shouldn't be able to.
4251460	4252580	You'll fuck it up.
4252580	4253780	You'll archers.
4254900	4256380	So, all right, now you go.
4256380	4257220	Better be good.
4259460	4260940	Well, I think the way that I was like,
4260940	4263420	I was like, oh, I haven't thought about my heart
4263420	4265460	visually like that, but I think the way
4265460	4267980	that you're talking about your heart is,
4267980	4269620	I'm just- Really gay?
4269620	4273140	Nova, what the fuck?
4273140	4275420	We're opening ourselves up now, come on.
4275420	4278540	No wonder I keep a fucking iron shell around my heart.
4278540	4282620	Yeah, this is a homophobic attacks.
4282620	4283460	Sorry, go ahead.
4284740	4287220	I think the way you're thinking of your heart
4287220	4289580	is maybe I've thought about my brain,
4289580	4292580	but it's like, maybe I feel the same way about it.
4292580	4294500	When I think about who I am and my emotions
4294500	4296580	and how I can be hurt, I'm just kind of picturing my brain.
4296620	4301260	But I think I would probably think about it in,
4301260	4303180	I don't know, I got really into,
4303180	4305460	I got really into Inside Out when I came out,
4305460	4308060	when it came out, and not when I came out.
4310420	4312860	Just in the thought of like, there's the five emotions,
4312860	4315380	you know, and then they have these essences and-
4315380	4316780	Don't forget those memory islands.
4316780	4318500	God damn it, that story has problems.
4318500	4319940	And the orbs.
4319940	4321180	Sorry, I don't mean to derail you.
4321180	4323540	I don't know, don't get mad, don't get mad.
4323540	4325300	I wanna get mad.
4325780	4326700	It made me cry, too.
4326700	4328900	I also cried during the movie.
4330500	4332340	I'm not stomping on your garden and going,
4332340	4333820	there's nothing of value here.
4333820	4334780	No, yeah.
4336500	4338780	But, because it's also like a real psychology concept
4338780	4340620	of there being like five emotions and stuff.
4340620	4343340	And I think of myself as a very emotional being
4343340	4345860	and a person of sort of moods and flavors and whatnot.
4345860	4346700	That sounds stupid.
4346700	4349700	But I think maybe if I were to picture like my heart,
4349700	4352660	it would be sort of a swirling essence of different colors
4352660	4354980	and maybe sort of like smoke.
4354980	4356700	I don't know, like I've thought about like aura.
4356700	4358540	I've been told by like more than one person
4358540	4361860	like that my aura is purple, which is,
4361860	4363260	I mean, that's like two people.
4363260	4365660	So it's not like, oh, that's the craziest coincidence ever.
4365660	4367100	Like it must be real, but-
4368100	4369460	No, it's purple.
4370820	4371660	Damn.
4373140	4374420	Jeff, do you see auras?
4375300	4376140	No.
4376140	4376980	I believe that.
4376980	4378060	Just nervous.
4378060	4380420	Isn't purple a good one?
4380420	4382020	I guess there's not a lot of bad auras.
4382020	4384060	They describe, the people who've told me
4384060	4387060	about a purple aura said it's like sort of cosmic.
4387060	4389140	It's like kind of different and out there
4389140	4391180	and like, I don't know, loving or bright or something,
4391180	4393220	which sounds really, really narcissistic
4393220	4395260	coming from my own self.
4395260	4396820	But yeah, I don't know.
4396820	4398460	I think I would think of it as just sort of a thing
4398460	4400020	of feelings and different things.
4400020	4402500	And I don't know, I kind of match things up in my head
4402500	4405140	of sort of like, oh, these things all have the same essence
4405140	4406020	or the same vibe.
4406020	4407900	And that's just sort of the way I think about things
4407900	4409300	more than like concrete things.
4409300	4410580	That sounds healthier.
4411580	4414700	Less practical, but that's okay.
4414700	4416740	I think it's interesting that things get more complicated
4416740	4418700	when you get up to your brain.
4418700	4420300	And the reason I will danceplain
4420300	4423540	that I find that interesting is because
4423540	4424860	I don't feel that way at all.
4424860	4428260	It's like the brain for me is like, get up there,
4428260	4430940	like where you can just run your fucking mouth
4430940	4433380	and for better or for worse, it'll all come out
4433380	4434620	and wash and all this stuff.
4434620	4438220	However, and I know you don't want to be laser focused on
4438220	4440380	as a representative of anything or whatever,
4440420	4443300	but the thing that makes you different from me
4443300	4445420	is that at some point in your life,
4445420	4447620	you started to feel conflicted about identity
4447620	4450060	in a way that is absolutely incompatible
4450060	4453020	with like neurotypical mainstream society.
4453020	4455700	Whereas I never had to think about myself
4455700	4457860	as anything but a fucking cool rebel,
4457860	4460100	even though I was just like,
4460100	4463060	because I never woke up going,
4463060	4465620	there's a thought in here that according
4465620	4469300	to that Miller Lite billboard is a criminal
4469300	4471660	or like cruising for a bruising
4471660	4474700	or maybe I shouldn't have,
4474700	4476580	maybe I need to just get through it and all this stuff.
4476580	4481580	And so it's terrifying for me to think about
4482180	4484500	the brain, which for me is like,
4484500	4486100	get up to your strong corner,
4486100	4488660	get away from your heart as like the place
4488660	4491100	that is actually needs to be tower defensed
4491100	4493300	and organized and...
4493300	4496020	Yeah, well, I think that maybe come from sort of,
4497020	4500500	that might come from sort of like how,
4500500	4503460	well, cause like, I mean,
4503460	4504940	that's kind of why things have been so weird
4504940	4507980	for me lately is because it was only like a couple months ago,
4507980	4511100	like probably less than six months ago or around that
4511100	4513940	when I got diagnosed with autism by my therapist.
4513940	4516100	And cause she hadn't said anything,
4516100	4517260	but I think she knew about it,
4517260	4518460	kind of like with your therapist
4518460	4519900	where it's like she finally felt okay,
4519900	4520740	bringing up the drinking.
4520740	4522100	One day I came in and I was like,
4522100	4523340	okay, come on.
4523340	4525900	Ever since I was, as long as I can form memories,
4526100	4528540	I can remember people being like,
4528540	4529620	oh, you're kind of different
4529620	4531020	or knowing that I'm kind of different
4531020	4532180	or just being kind of different
4532180	4535220	and all these stupid tiny little ways, you know,
4535220	4536260	that I'm like, okay,
4536260	4539260	but like nobody else I know is thinking that way,
4539260	4541060	even if it seems like a small thing,
4541060	4543940	like it's just sort of like this thing that is all of me.
4543940	4546540	It's not like one particular thing about me.
4546540	4549460	So then when she said that
4549460	4551100	and I kind of absorbed it in everything,
4551100	4554780	I was like, okay, because yes, like you said,
4554780	4557260	I guess what would be different about us is that
4557260	4558340	as long as I can remember,
4558340	4560220	I've thought about like who I am
4560220	4562340	and like how I'm different from other people
4562340	4564900	and I don't know how I'm the same and stuff.
4564900	4567260	And yeah, I've always been kind of analyzing
4567260	4569100	like who I am and what I am.
4569100	4571780	And I've never been able to kind of
4571780	4574660	bring any sort of practicality to that of like,
4574660	4578020	like a lot of kids like act different
4578020	4579420	to avoid being bullied.
4579420	4580900	I mean, I wasn't bullied too bad,
4580900	4582900	but it never even occurred to me
4582900	4584260	that I could try being different.
4584900	4586860	Like I was like, well, okay, this is it,
4586860	4587820	then I get bullied then
4587820	4590260	or this is how I try to make them stop the bullying,
4590260	4592260	but it never occurred to me to ever be anything
4592260	4593940	other than what I am.
4593940	4596060	And now that I'm like 20
4596060	4598940	and thinking about trying to maybe get a job and stuff,
4598940	4601180	it's, I'm thinking like, oh, well,
4601180	4602820	do I have to enter into a world
4602820	4604060	where I'm not gonna be able to be me
4604060	4606660	and I'm gonna have to do practical things or something?
4606660	4608820	And I don't know.
4608820	4611180	I think that's like the thing I love
4611180	4613780	about the autistic community.
4615260	4620260	Is that like humanity itself in a really magnified way,
4621780	4626740	precisely because there is a deprivation of objective truth
4626740	4631740	that comes more easy to typical people
4632180	4635420	that or in the case of, if you look at humanity,
4635420	4637460	it's like easy for a skunk to know
4637460	4639220	if it's doing what it should be doing.
4639220	4642860	It's easy for a giraffe, fucking giraffes.
4642860	4645380	No, shout out to giraffes who are like dying
4645380	4646460	in Griffith Park Zoo right now,
4646460	4650700	so let's get, let's not be, let's not be mean.
4650700	4651740	I don't think it's a zoo anymore.
4651740	4654340	Sharks are great, whatever, don't derail me.
4654340	4656340	I'm on a fucking roll, can't you hear this?
4656340	4661340	But as we talked to our friend Steve Silverman
4661500	4665980	who wrote Neurotribes, that within humanity,
4665980	4670700	that people who have autistic traits
4670700	4675700	also are like, they're like, well, wait, what am I?
4675820	4678860	I don't have this sort of like compulsion
4678860	4683860	for these sort of like easy truths or whatever,
4683900	4688420	but because of that, even as uncomfortable as it feels,
4688420	4690980	dance-blading autism, dance-blading everything to you,
4690980	4693620	but this is just, I just find this to be a very romantic
4693620	4696420	and wonderful concept, because of that,
4696420	4698780	there's an increased attention on it.
4698780	4701580	There may not be what feels like facile awareness,
4701580	4704300	and that can feel so alienating and so sad
4704300	4706340	that it's like, it's that Pinocchio syndrome thing,
4706340	4709740	which autistic people, it looks like they hate
4709740	4712140	in television stuff, they hate like neurotypicals going like,
4712140	4715660	oh, bleep-bloop just wants to be human,
4715660	4719060	but at the same time, at the core of that is this idea
4719060	4724060	of I am separate, so you wake up the same as everything
4724300	4726180	and don't even have to make a choice.
4726180	4730580	Here I am wondering who the fuck I am.
4730580	4735580	Those people have this power to examine the things
4736420	4738780	that other people take for granted and go,
4739980	4742500	then that's why I think this tradition of creatives
4742500	4744140	and artists and things, it's like,
4744140	4745660	oh, I'm gonna make Calvin and Hobbes
4745660	4747540	because I don't know what the fuck it means
4747540	4749980	to be this or that, I don't mean to diagnose that guy,
4749980	4751140	but anyways.
4751140	4753100	Well, I think I haven't really heard
4753100	4754700	that specific take on autism,
4754700	4755540	which is really interesting.
4755540	4756660	I haven't even coined it.
4756660	4760540	But I've heard that a lot about being trans
4760540	4763340	because gender is so deeply ingrained in our society
4763340	4765340	and from the smallest to the biggest ways
4765340	4769100	that if you think I'm not that, what everything seems to be,
4769100	4773220	it's like, oh, I feel like I'm starting from scratch
4773220	4775700	or something and all these personality traits,
4775700	4778740	I have to like, yeah, you examine things more
4778740	4781020	and you don't feel like you can fall
4781020	4782780	into easily defined things.
4782780	4786060	Yeah, thank God for people going like finally like,
4786060	4788180	hey, you know what, there actually is such a thing
4788180	4791700	as somebody that doesn't even, doesn't know.
4791700	4793820	Like, you wanna play some duck duck goose game?
4793820	4795940	I'd maybe duck, maybe goose, maybe both.
4795940	4797740	I'd like, like, why don't we ask that?
4797740	4799540	Like, and of course you're gonna get
4799540	4803540	those tomatoes thrown at you, but like, it is such a,
4803540	4806580	it's like, it makes every single person
4806580	4811460	at every bachelorette party, every construction site,
4811460	4814180	these archetypes we conjure of the most binary
4814180	4817180	committed people, myself included,
4817180	4820940	like after all the reaction of like, oh, what's next?
4820940	4825940	Come on, then thought has to happen just for the fuck of it.
4826340	4828380	Even, you know, it can start as like,
4830700	4833420	what you think is punching down curiosity is like,
4833420	4835540	all right, well, let me get this straight.
4835540	4838780	But those roads can at least lead to inspection
4838780	4842380	because I think it's such an important thing
4842380	4843980	for that reason.
4843980	4846500	It's like a skeleton key to all this other shit
4846500	4849060	because also, as I've said, like,
4849060	4851460	and I don't know if this is offensive to people,
4851460	4855900	but I'll learn that it is for the reason I learned it is,
4855900	4858980	but I've always thought in the back of my head, you know,
4858980	4862980	there's never gonna be a million trans movement, literally,
4862980	4865900	just, it's never gonna be, it's never gonna be this thing
4865900	4867940	that we're used to, which is like,
4867940	4871500	numbers, numbers, numbers, and good
4871500	4874220	because we've entered a world where that numbers
4874220	4877260	are not what are making things change.
4877260	4881420	Sometimes, oh, catastrophically, it can take one troll
4881420	4885540	and 20 bots to fuck up an entire thing
4885540	4888180	that actually is a pillar of society or whatever.
4889740	4892660	We need to actually graduate beyond
4892660	4896660	this populist idea of democracy where it's like,
4896660	4898260	well, if you're a million people,
4898260	4900180	you're less important than two million people
4900180	4903340	and get into like, okay, we gotta make sure
4903340	4904620	we have to have an acid test
4904620	4907660	and it can come down to one individual,
4907660	4912660	which is more, you know, I think it's not only more liberal,
4913020	4916860	it's also, I think that it's more practical
4916860	4919460	in terms of becoming a planet of eight billion people
4919460	4921180	that are all connected telepathically
4921180	4923200	and trying to get the fuck off of a burning cinder
4923200	4927320	that they've eaten all the giraffes off of.
4928760	4932200	We're gonna have to have a fundamental respect for humans.
4932200	4935200	We're not gonna be able to continue to have curve balls.
4935200	4938960	You know, like we can't, it's like the shot clock
4938960	4942840	is so near zero, we cannot continue to go,
4942840	4946120	okay, it's okay that you're black,
4946120	4949520	but now let's get back to work.
4949520	4951800	What, you're a woman?
4951800	4953720	That's, get outta here!
4953720	4958720	Like we gotta stop being so thrown by people saying,
4958920	4963400	I, over here, table five needs bread.
4963400	4965480	We can't keep going, like close the restaurant.
4965480	4967200	Fuck you, why are you eating here?
4967200	4968040	What's food?
4968040	4969100	Should we make it illegal?
4969100	4971480	We have to just get to a place where we're like,
4971480	4972840	table five needs bread, got it.
4972840	4976000	Like we, it's a terrible metaphor, but like.
4976000	4978200	I think I get it though.
4978200	4983160	Yeah, I, yeah, I think it's pretty insane,
4983160	4986520	although also just knowing about the nature of humans
4986520	4991520	or something, like I think, I mean,
4991680	4994720	it makes sense logically, but if you think,
4994720	4996720	like if I really think about it, it just,
4996720	5000360	it makes, it's so insane to me, like the rules we've created
5000360	5001640	and how many rules are created.
5001640	5004120	We think of like, oh, the 50s were insane, you know,
5004120	5005800	you had to have your fork on the right.
5005800	5008000	That's crazy, I'll have my fork on the left,
5008640	5011880	but it's like, we still have so many deeply ingrained things
5011880	5013800	that go way beyond where you put your fork,
5013800	5016880	like what a harmless rule to have in your society,
5016880	5020480	but there's deeper ones that are harmful.
5020480	5022080	Like racism.
5022080	5024040	Yeah, but there's also like little things.
5024040	5025120	Just to name a few.
5025120	5029040	Yeah, there's things that are really big
5029040	5031840	and really bad like that, but there's also like little things
5031840	5033880	that it's weird that it's a rule,
5033880	5037920	but on such a large scale, I don't know, it's just.
5038720	5040040	Yeah, you get indoctrinated into shit
5040040	5042760	and everybody wants to be a good person pretty much.
5042760	5045840	And you go like, okay, now if I put my fork
5045840	5049080	on the wrong side, I'm called an anti-hero,
5049080	5054080	I'm called an upstart, I'm called a kind of like cool person.
5055680	5059240	But it's like that can be taught to you as a child
5059240	5062160	and then that person precisely because,
5062160	5064560	and reference back to me getting offended
5064560	5067280	with in the midst of myself deprecation,
5067280	5069040	somebody suggests that I'm a bad person,
5069040	5071720	I get mad at them and abuse them.
5071720	5076280	That is the problem with kind of like
5076280	5079200	institutionalized liberalism, for instance,
5079200	5083360	where you go, hey, I'm a liberal, I voted for this,
5083360	5086720	I understand that racism's bad, here's how racism's defined,
5086720	5088120	here's whether I'm sexist,
5088120	5090800	here's whether I've ever sexually harassed anyone,
5090800	5093600	here's whether I'm an advocate of this community or that.
5093600	5095960	And then someone says, hey man,
5095960	5097880	what you did there was a little disrespectful
5097880	5100400	and you bite their fucking head off because,
5100400	5103200	what am I, a Nazi, how dare you and all that stuff.
5103200	5106000	And I think that it's, that illustrates this wall
5106000	5110000	that you're talking about and instead of this process
5110000	5112840	that we've, it has been fine because it's moved
5112840	5116080	at a speed faster than the average caveman,
5116080	5118800	which is like, build the wall here, okay,
5118800	5120160	wall needs to be torn down,
5120160	5123360	we're gonna move it 20 feet out everybody, okay, all right,
5123360	5125320	grumble, grumble, now it's harder to get to work,
5125360	5127320	grumble, grumble, but nothing collapses.
5127320	5128800	We're hitting this tipping point now
5128800	5132120	where the walls are digital and so is the road to work
5132120	5135000	and so is the path to democracy, so is the,
5135000	5138920	and it's like, holy shit, if we can't get it through our head
5138920	5143600	that just in general, take it as it comes
5143600	5146640	and don't allow yourself to be fucking thrown
5146640	5151640	by other people where if we don't upgrade that firmware
5152080	5155760	to where we don't have to have a fucking forum,
5155760	5158080	I'm repeating myself, like we're gonna die.
5158920	5163920	Anyways, in the news today, we probably are already dying.
5165240	5167480	You were prompted to raise, you were compelled
5167480	5168320	to raise your hand.
5168320	5169160	For a while now.
5169160	5172000	I just had a question, has your therapist ever asked you
5172000	5174160	if you want to be compressed?
5174160	5176480	Ha ha ha, the question was,
5176480	5177320	I has.
5177320	5180960	Has my therapist, has any, has we both answered it,
5180960	5182280	has your therapist ever asked you
5182280	5184400	if you want to be depressed?
5184400	5188240	No, she never has, but I've always wondered that.
5188240	5190320	Ask her if she can ask you that.
5190320	5192160	Ha ha ha, that could be fun.
5192160	5194720	Well, you've talked about how you are really comfortable
5194720	5197560	with being unhappy or comfortable being depressed
5197560	5199520	or being a workaholic or something.
5199520	5202800	Right, so yeah, actually, I hadn't put it in that context,
5202800	5204800	but in that sense, very much so.
5204800	5208280	She's definitely lowered that challenge or rather warning.
5209280	5211400	Sounds like you're getting really close to happiness
5211400	5216400	and coping with it can bring out all kinds of shit.
5217000	5218440	Yeah, I think I self-sabotage.
5218440	5219600	I'm terrified of success.
5219600	5221560	I've tried eating and exercising
5221560	5222920	for years and years and years,
5222920	5224560	but I always have this thought of what if everything
5224560	5227560	gets better than what the fuck will I do?
5227560	5230680	It's been such a huge, huge challenge for me this last year
5230680	5233280	because traditionally what I do is,
5233280	5236240	oh, look, he made that thing.
5236240	5237440	Oh, everyone's happy.
5237520	5240160	Oh, they just, oh, Annie and Jeff to get together
5240160	5241400	or maybe he's gonna kiss Britta.
5241400	5242240	You have a fandom.
5242240	5243560	You have people on Tumblr.
5243560	5244400	They like your show.
5244400	5245220	You're doing good.
5245220	5246640	You did it, you did it, you fucking monkey.
5246640	5248440	You did it, you made other monkeys happy.
5248440	5250480	And then, boom, what's he doing?
5250480	5254480	I'm getting mad at Sony and driving home in tears
5254480	5256120	because my show is so important
5256120	5257120	and how can they understand it?
5257120	5259440	It's like, you look back on that and I go,
5259440	5261880	self-sabotage, it has to be.
5261880	5264260	There was never enough of a threat
5264260	5266220	that I ever had to go to DEF CON this or that.
5266220	5268620	However, I still, I'm like, fuck people
5268620	5270100	who say pick your battles and all that stuff.
5270100	5274820	And this last year has been therefore like this thing
5274820	5276660	where it's like, okay, you did it.
5276660	5281660	You made a successful show by all the metrics
5282580	5285220	that you used to abide by.
5286200	5287540	Also, in addition to that,
5287540	5289400	you're going to get recognized and rewarded for it
5289400	5292420	to the point where you might die happy
5292420	5294520	or whatever that fucking goal is.
5294520	5298960	And all of a sudden, it seems like
5298960	5301540	you're actually being targeted unfairly.
5301540	5305840	However, if you talk about it,
5305840	5310840	it could cause enough of a shit storm to get you fired.
5313380	5316700	It would be feeding the trolls, it would be,
5316700	5320720	and it's like, oh, wait, where does the self-sabotage end?
5320760	5323640	Does it end when you stop talking
5323640	5326040	about the things that upset you?
5326040	5329480	Because my mouth gets me fired a lot.
5329480	5332640	And so one would reason if they were trying
5332640	5335880	to destroy my life that it would be as easy
5335880	5339760	as lobbing a dead cat into a part of the courtyard
5339760	5342720	where I was bound to put on a show about it
5342720	5345960	and spread disease and take my whole kingdom down.
5346800	5350280	And so then you get into, oh, now I'm doing things
5350280	5353060	because it's what the enemy doesn't want.
5353960	5357160	I'm like, when did I become a fucking liar for a living?
5357160	5359280	When did I wake up every day and go,
5359280	5361160	first of all, what do you think?
5361160	5363120	Okay, now what do you say?
5363120	5365080	And have those two things be separate.
5365080	5366680	It's miserable.
5366680	5369920	It's not as miserable as anybody listening.
5369920	5371260	Everyone has those problems,
5371260	5375720	but that's why it's been a weird year.
5375720	5379940	Because I'm like, wait, you can beat the people
5379960	5384960	that want to destroy you by never paying any attention to it.
5386740	5391740	And it feels like going like this while people kick you,
5393180	5394580	which I've never done.
5394580	5397260	But then again, I've never been a huge counter puncher.
5397260	5399220	I'm not like a fucking warrior.
5399220	5401620	I don't go like, nobody fucks with me.
5402620	5407620	What I do is every week I go, well, this happened today.
5407700	5409660	Well, this happened today.
5409660	5410900	Someone wrote this about me.
5410900	5413100	Someone said this, this is how that felt.
5413100	5415380	And then no matter what, every day I go home,
5415380	5417460	I'm like, every week at least I recalibrate.
5417460	5419620	And I go, well, I don't have anything bouncing around
5419620	5421160	in my head anymore.
5421160	5425580	But as I keep referencing, we're a year now going
5425580	5429380	into this, I'm like, what am I, a fucking senator?
5429380	5433820	Where I'm like, it's like the smart thing for me to do
5433820	5438820	to be polite or comported.
5441700	5443620	Is that what enemies want?
5443620	5444820	Do we live by what enemies?
5444820	5449820	But my therapist got, she finally got there.
5450140	5452540	And I did say this in New York, so I'll be repeating it.
5452540	5457540	But she finally said, so you are a 45 year old man
5458420	5463420	who has been able to say, I don't care forever.
5467540	5470940	And now you care, and that's difficult.
5472020	5475540	And it sounds really, it's a really, really unfortunate
5475540	5479700	thing that the messengers of that have to be trolls,
5479700	5483940	Nazis, and she didn't have to finish her thought
5483940	5485740	because then I got it, I was like, oh, yeah.
5485740	5489700	So in other words, if it weren't these stupid stories
5489700	5492900	and these stupid times, it would be time for me
5492900	5497900	to graduate from deliberately disaffected,
5500020	5503100	I don't care about nothing, you can't get near me.
5503100	5507380	It's a wonder I was married for eight months kind of thing.
5507380	5510500	It's like, too, holy shit, I love someone.
5510500	5512540	Holy shit, I'm proud of my job.
5512620	5516060	Holy shit, I don't wanna get fired.
5516060	5518260	Holy shit, I don't wanna hurt people.
5518260	5520860	Holy shit, there are people out there
5520860	5524300	that you can hurt by doing nothing.
5524300	5526900	Holy shit, there are people out there that I've hurt
5526900	5529500	when I thought I was the victim
5529500	5532340	because they didn't like me enough.
5532340	5535300	Holy shit, I am part of the problem
5535300	5537100	even by not being part of the problem.
5537100	5541820	And holy shit, there are people who are lying in way
5541820	5544900	drooling for any sign of vulnerability
5544900	5549660	so they can jump on me and any nut sack sticking out,
5549660	5552060	they will grab and twist and try to rip off
5552060	5554180	because they don't even believe I'm real.
5555180	5558380	And it's like, welcome to the party,
5558380	5560860	which is not even, it's like, let alone being famous,
5560860	5564180	it's like, I think that's everyone over the age of 30.
5564180	5566420	Everybody has to go to a job
5566420	5568100	where they have to like fucking,
5568100	5569860	they have to worry about,
5570860	5572980	like, oh, my happiness is,
5572980	5575180	but that's the negative way of putting it.
5575180	5577860	Everyone in adulthood starts to realize
5577860	5579620	what they love and what they like.
5579620	5581660	And then the crucial key is
5582660	5585340	don't worry about whether or not to be vulnerable,
5585340	5588020	be honest, keep being honest.
5588020	5591180	Because if you're honest and you say,
5591180	5593020	here's a nut sack, it's on my knee,
5593020	5597020	and someone runs up and kicks it, okay, ouch.
5597660	5602660	But you can't just rearrange and go like,
5603180	5608180	my knee's bulletproof, because that's what nut sacks are.
5608340	5610140	They're bulletproof.
5610140	5612500	And it's like, that, it's like, I don't wanna live
5612500	5613340	a fucking lie.
5613340	5614660	I want you to extend this metaphor
5614660	5616140	as long as you can.
5616140	5616980	Yeah.
5618780	5620740	Well, it's like in Red Dead Redemption.
5620740	5621580	Yeah.
5621580	5622420	It's like in Red Dead Redemption.
5622420	5626900	But I really think, so talking to this youngster here,
5626900	5631900	I'm saying, like, whatever's going on with you,
5635740	5637540	and it seems like you got good parents,
5637540	5639980	because you're not, it doesn't sound like
5639980	5644900	you're a product of abuse or alienation on the home front.
5644900	5646780	You have a dad that's dropping you off
5646780	5648020	and picking you up here.
5648020	5652540	And that could be a higher challenge,
5652540	5655340	because you don't have anybody to blame but yourself,
5655340	5657060	and then you don't know what that's supposed to mean
5657060	5662060	and all that stuff, but so what you've got to do
5662060	5665540	to maintain your sanity, I think, is connect and share
5665540	5670540	and understand that you will be assailed and hurt,
5672900	5676660	but that pain isn't real.
5676660	5678220	It's real, it's a real feeling,
5678220	5680300	but it's not real destruction.
5680300	5683300	Because the only real destruction is if a tentacle goes out
5683380	5686940	and someone kicks it and it hurts so you recoil,
5686940	5689540	which is what we all do in response to trauma,
5689540	5692780	then that's the actual physical effect of the kick,
5692780	5694740	is that there's no more tentacle there anymore.
5694740	5696660	That's a place where there's no more connection.
5696660	5701300	But the pain of the kick didn't actually damage
5701300	5702940	the tentacle, it's a dumb metaphor,
5702940	5704220	because of course if you kick a tentacle,
5704220	5705140	you're gonna damage it.
5705140	5707420	No, it's fine, it's like when you touch a snail's eye,
5707420	5708740	it pops right back out.
5709660	5712500	Yeah, I think.
5712500	5713900	Well, what's up, raise handy.
5713900	5715460	Our new character, Handy Raise.
5718780	5720500	Well, yeah, why don't you come up and grab a mic
5720500	5723260	and what's that?
5723260	5724500	It's someone's birthday.
5724500	5727580	Oh, it's your birthday.
5727580	5730620	I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing at our world.
5730620	5732420	Do you think I can have some more?
5732420	5733260	Come on up, birthday.
5733260	5734100	Thank you so much.
5735060	5736020	Three people again.
5739060	5740900	I'm suddenly a fan of my podcast,
5740900	5742140	because I just like that idea.
5742140	5744260	And he's like this, and then another person goes,
5744260	5746020	just bring them up.
5746020	5749660	And then a woman goes, it's my birthday.
5749660	5751900	I like all of that for all reasons.
5751900	5752940	I didn't mean to start anything,
5752940	5754460	I just had a follow up question,
5754460	5756140	because I'm interested in the topic.
5756140	5756980	Yeah, I don't think we're-
5756980	5758540	What day's your birthday again?
5758540	5760900	11-11, it was yesterday.
5760900	5761740	Happy birthday.
5761740	5762580	Thanks.
5762580	5763420	What's your name?
5763420	5764260	Caroline.
5764260	5765100	Caroline.
5765100	5766260	Hi, hi guys, sorry.
5766260	5767100	Hi Caroline.
5767100	5767940	Nice to meet you.
5768580	5769420	What's your name?
5769420	5770260	Enova.
5770260	5771100	Asa, nice to meet you.
5771100	5771940	Asa.
5771940	5773060	Dan, right?
5773060	5773900	Thank you very much.
5773900	5775660	Would you like a water?
5775660	5776500	Birthday?
5777500	5778540	A birthday water.
5778540	5779660	I would love it, thanks.
5779660	5781100	Oh yeah, I could use a coke.
5781100	5782060	I could use a coke.
5784340	5785180	Can a coke.
5786620	5789460	Turkey, mayo, lettuce, tomato, lightly toast.
5789460	5790500	A joke.
5790500	5792220	Okay, Asa, what was your follow up?
5792220	5795300	My follow up question was, how do you then,
5795300	5797420	you answered my former question of,
5797500	5800220	do you think that you want to be depressed?
5800220	5803100	But my follow up was like, how then do you distinguish
5803100	5807100	between your maladaptive behavior versus behavior
5807100	5809340	that is healthy, but then is punished, you know?
5809340	5810700	Like you're talking about being honest
5810700	5813660	and being upfront with people in big platforms like this,
5813660	5815780	which seems healthy, but then you've learned
5815780	5817100	to like recoil from that.
5817100	5819900	So how do you distinctify between maladaptive behaviors
5819900	5820740	versus like-
5820740	5822820	My theory as of the last couple of weeks
5822820	5827380	that made me so relieved because it makes me comfortable
5827380	5832180	again, is that the answer is whether or not it's true.
5833420	5835980	Because that was for so long my definition of,
5838300	5840100	I rubbed a mannequin leg on my nipple,
5840100	5842580	I have a nylon fetish, I put a thing in my butt,
5842580	5845580	you know, people, it's like, there's no such thing
5845580	5848840	as truth that should hurt you.
5849820	5853220	There's technically one, you know, if you were,
5853220	5855780	for instance, a pedophile, like there's a set,
5855780	5859020	we have this like go-to crime where we go,
5859020	5862900	because, you know, aside from just regular rape,
5862900	5864660	like of a non-consensual person, it's like,
5864660	5867020	there's absolutely, it's like the word pedophile
5867020	5869260	is the only thing worse than anything sexually,
5869260	5871460	in addition to being worse than a Nazi,
5871460	5875020	and, or so we feel emotionally.
5875020	5879180	And so like other, if you weren't that,
5880660	5884660	then theoretically anything that you were,
5884660	5889340	anything that you could say out loud in this country,
5889340	5892300	it should not be anything that you,
5892300	5896540	that would automatically cause destruction to your life.
5896540	5898020	It could cause embarrassment,
5898020	5902180	but it shouldn't cause you actual loss of property.
5902180	5903300	Well, that's really interesting,
5903300	5904820	because sometimes I'll get into a space
5904820	5906300	where I'm feeling bad about myself,
5906300	5908220	and then I'll ask my therapist like,
5908220	5911180	do you think it's okay if I start playing this video game
5911180	5912600	because I like it and stuff?
5912840	5915920	I just feel really guilty about doing things that I enjoy,
5917000	5920320	and one time I was just like,
5920320	5922960	can I just, like, you know, facing adulthood,
5922960	5925440	you're like, wow, you can really do anything, mostly.
5925440	5927520	I was like, can I just do anything I want?
5927520	5930360	And she said, yes, well, you can,
5930360	5931920	because I know that you're not gonna do anything
5931920	5934600	that's gonna destroy your life or someone else's.
5934600	5936200	Well, she knew you were a heroin addict,
5936200	5939560	but I think, you know, and you needed there for it.
5939560	5941680	But my therapist always said right away,
5941680	5945560	she's just like, if it's free and fun, do it.
5945560	5947480	Yeah, if you're not hurting anybody or yourself
5947480	5948720	is what mine says, yeah.
5948720	5952400	Yeah, and so that is the answer to Ace's question,
5952400	5955760	which is like, I have the luxury,
5955760	5959400	my heart goes out to people who aren't in these shoes,
5959400	5963280	hence the episode where I went to bat for profiles.
5963280	5964920	It was like 100 episodes ago
5964920	5966720	where I had seen that Pervert Park documentary,
5966720	5968720	and I was like, god damn it, that must suck,
5968720	5971960	because I can't control my sexuality,
5971960	5974640	so what if you couldn't and your sexuality
5974640	5977840	was literally illegal and literally involved hurting people?
5979560	5983360	Shouldn't we spare a thought for a treatment and whatnot
5983360	5984480	to break the cycle?
5985600	5990600	But I have the luxury of as bad as it gets
5991440	5994200	is what you see,
5994200	5996840	which is like, I just fascinated with myself
5996840	5999760	and I like toes on my nipple
5999760	6001320	and I like girls in pantyhose
6001320	6004640	and I like everything that I've talked about
6004640	6006840	for 300 episodes of this podcast,
6006840	6009120	which means I have that privilege
6009120	6013620	of if I just dump everything from my brain out of my mouth,
6014480	6016800	then along the way, the worst I can do
6016800	6019040	is use the wrong pronoun, say the N word,
6019040	6021960	these sort of like, kind of like verbal gaffes
6021960	6025200	that could be, but you'd have to be,
6025200	6027120	you'd have to desire to destroy me
6027120	6032120	to then take those mistakes and go,
6032200	6034800	therefore, we should destroy this person,
6036800	6039000	and that I think is the reality
6039000	6042160	that we have to cope with,
6042160	6046080	which is if somebody wants to hurt you,
6047320	6051760	there's no way to beat them in the game of I'm hurtable,
6051760	6056760	and it's not a victory to be unheardable.
6056960	6061400	It's not a victory to have a shield around you
6061400	6063560	that in turrets that keep people
6063560	6064920	from coming near your front lawn.
6064920	6069920	That is not a way to die laughing at everybody
6070760	6072120	and saying, I had the perfect life.
6072120	6077120	You will die with a vague feeling probably of deep unease
6077920	6082920	and sadness, because when my therapist said that,
6084240	6086960	she was like, she would be the last person
6086960	6089320	that I would think after everything that she's heard
6090760	6093860	to recommend that I continue to do this podcast.
6095520	6096960	I would never have thought.
6098320	6100200	I would think that she would have been like,
6100200	6102400	yeah, that seems like an unhealthy fixation
6102400	6104360	you have on yourself, and maybe now that you're growing,
6104360	6105920	you should retire the microphone
6105920	6109880	and go live in a normal person, it's time.
6109880	6114880	But she was like, you need to be honest,
6115920	6120800	and the more honest you are, the stronger you feel and are,
6120800	6122720	and the more you're actually,
6125960	6127840	the more helpful you are.
6127840	6130800	And so that's, yeah, I've answered your question 90 times.
6130800	6135160	That's the path, it's like maladaptive, healthy, unhealthy,
6135240	6138000	who knows, I've been up here and being defensive about it.
6138000	6140880	I was up here for more episodes than not saying,
6140880	6142800	I hate therapy, I don't believe in therapy.
6142800	6144360	I've been up here saying, don't vote,
6144360	6145280	your vote doesn't matter.
6145280	6146520	Then I've been up here saying,
6146520	6148520	we should run out on the street and kill Nazis.
6151240	6153560	Really, who cares, quote unquote,
6153560	6158560	whether the behaviors and thoughts are healthy, unhealthy,
6158800	6162080	or leading down the yellow brick road,
6162080	6165400	or a dirt path that makes Dorothy a cyborg.
6165400	6169600	However, which arguably sounds like a cooler story
6169600	6173480	than one where it turns out you could go home at any time
6173480	6176000	and the bad guy can be killed with water.
6176000	6181000	But what's important is for me,
6181240	6184880	maybe not for other people, but for me,
6184880	6188480	it's vital that I gotta be saying what I'm thinking.
6188480	6190480	Or I'll just, I'll put a gun in my mouth.
6190480	6193520	Like I will, and that's why I'm so,
6193520	6198520	that's why I'm so, traditionally so adamant about,
6199200	6200760	every time we mention suicide in the show
6200760	6204080	and you notice I always have this like,
6204080	6206080	kids don't talk to somebody, et cetera.
6206080	6210560	Cause it's like before I started this kind of
6210560	6213760	seemingly self-destructive practice of speaking
6213760	6217000	into a microphone about everything that's going on with me,
6217000	6218960	a behavior that has gotten me fired
6219000	6220760	more than it's gotten me hired,
6220760	6223240	a behavior that at times seems like
6223240	6225320	you just wish it would stop
6225320	6228160	because if he would just stop doing it,
6228160	6229480	then everything would be fine.
6229480	6231160	Just shut up, Dan.
6231160	6234560	But for me, maybe not for other people,
6234560	6239560	like it's like these thoughts like in your skull,
6242600	6247040	they just, they bounce off every interior surface
6247160	6252160	every time they do, they accrue thoughts about them.
6252760	6257760	And they just get so big, so fast.
6258000	6261000	And then as soon as they come out of your mouth,
6261000	6262760	it doesn't matter if people applaud,
6262760	6264360	it doesn't matter if people boo,
6264360	6266440	it doesn't matter if they ignore it.
6266440	6270400	The important thing that happens is it came out
6270400	6272200	and now it's gone.
6272200	6274240	I've found that over and over again,
6274280	6275920	just like, boom.
6275920	6278760	It's just like, I said,
6280160	6284440	I stuck a Sharpie pen up my ass once
6284440	6287240	because I wanted to see if it would make me come harder.
6287240	6289720	And for the rest of my life,
6289720	6292600	that Sharpie pen has no power over me.
6292600	6295360	It doesn't matter if the audience went,
6295360	6298320	yay, let's go buy stock in Sharpie.
6298320	6301080	It doesn't matter if you're so brave.
6301080	6302560	It doesn't matter, it's like,
6302560	6305440	what matters is that I didn't die.
6305440	6307560	It's kind of like, I mean,
6307560	6310320	so I had sex with my third grade teacher to get an A
6310320	6311600	and I too was homeschooled.
6311600	6313560	So, yeah, it was really.
6313560	6315080	Damn.
6315080	6317960	Is that a genuine story from your life?
6317960	6319080	Yeah, her mom.
6319080	6319920	Kind of.
6319920	6320800	No, I was, yeah.
6320800	6321640	No, I'm joking.
6323640	6324640	What you're talking about.
6324640	6325480	Well, it's your birthday.
6325480	6329640	You're allowed to run through the fields of,
6329720	6331680	of incest.
6331680	6332920	I just want to say something.
6332920	6334920	I just want to say something memorable.
6337000	6339360	What you're talking about is exactly what I've been working
6339360	6341280	on in therapy, which is why I was so curious
6341280	6344600	is because something that my therapist told me recently
6344600	6347160	that was actually one of those big revelation moments
6347160	6350280	was that you're not always trying to fix yourself.
6350280	6353720	Sometimes you're just trying to learn to be okay.
6355240	6356680	And that I'm all in therapy,
6356680	6357960	at least I'm always trying to be like,
6357960	6359920	so I feel this way about this.
6359920	6361240	And I think like, sort of like you were talking
6361240	6363360	about earlier, Nova, I feel this way about this.
6363360	6364320	And I think it's because of this.
6364320	6366080	And I think if I thought about it this way,
6366080	6367600	then everything would be fine.
6367600	6369360	But sometimes it's like, no, no, no,
6369360	6374200	it's okay to just think something that's maybe not great.
6374200	6375680	You don't have to accept things to,
6375680	6377560	you don't have to like things to accept them.
6377560	6379160	And there's a thing I've read in these,
6379160	6381000	some of these books, but it's like, what's his name?
6381000	6383080	I can't fucking Seligman or something like that.
6383080	6383920	He was like this guy.
6383920	6386240	It's like, there's a sort of this happiness thing.
6386880	6391600	It's a nuanced, this idea of we'll get,
6391600	6396040	if you're worried about going to Thanksgiving
6396040	6400840	because you hate, you're uncomfortable talking
6400840	6402600	to your uncle, I know I'm gonna,
6402600	6403840	this is gonna be an awful metaphor
6403840	6406480	that doesn't land the point, but here I go.
6406480	6408720	But I'm like, you're on your way to this,
6408720	6412440	you're invited to a party that makes you nervous
6412440	6415720	for some reason, let's say, or you're uncomfortable.
6415720	6420280	We think that the day that you realize
6420280	6423680	you don't wanna go to the party because your uncle's racist
6425120	6430120	or that, even though that thought doesn't make you happy,
6431040	6435160	we believe, we don't think that you're following
6435160	6437760	your comfort because what's comfortable
6437760	6439640	about the thought that your uncle's racist, right?
6439640	6443280	Or that you're a fuckup that'll just get lost
6443280	6444240	on the way to the party.
6444680	6448920	We say negative shit to ourselves
6448920	6451440	that actually causes a dopamine spike
6451440	6454960	because it causes us to, it gives us a little fire escape
6454960	6458320	out of a zone of discomfort, so.
6458320	6460040	Pretending that we understand something
6460040	6461360	for the sake of not thinking about it.
6461360	6466160	Exactly, yeah, no one likes to be uncertain
6466160	6469120	and yet, yeah, it's like, actually,
6469120	6472840	uncertainty is a huge invitation to a really,
6473840	6476840	you know, beneficial burning man where weird ideas
6476840	6479920	can happen while you have no idea what the fuck you think.
6479920	6481120	But it feels like pain to us.
6481120	6482520	It actually feels criminal to us.
6482520	6485080	And then you go, you know what, fuck that guy.
6485080	6486200	I'm not going to his party.
6486200	6488760	And even though it creates this negative thing
6488760	6492640	in your life, you're happy.
6492640	6494600	You made yourself happy.
6494600	6496280	I thought I saw a hand or something out there,
6496280	6497440	but it's probably just people going,
6497440	6498880	Jesus Christ, how long is this show?
6498880	6501480	Yeah, it's probably just four people looking
6501480	6502880	at their watches in unison.
6504520	6505640	I'm having a great time.
6505640	6508720	Oh, this is a dream come true.
6508720	6510360	Well, we should be fair.
6510360	6513800	Asa was out front handing out his flyers for Asonomics.
6513800	6516000	It's a new religion that.
6516000	6517680	Everybody gets $5 and that's it.
6517680	6518520	His name's not even Asa.
6518520	6519520	He's selling copies of the Asanomicon.
6519520	6522520	It stands for assertiveness, spirit,
6522520	6524760	and more assertiveness.
6524760	6526440	Or angle, side angle, you know,
6526440	6529480	any of those acronyms and raising for profit.
6529480	6531040	I was just going to say what you're saying
6531040	6532360	about honesty and everything.
6532360	6533680	I think, like I said, when I was a kid,
6533680	6535680	I could never not be myself.
6535680	6539680	And I think now I felt pressure to maybe kind of change
6539680	6542120	or to police certain thoughts.
6542120	6544760	And I think maybe that's kind of making me really sick
6544760	6546480	inside, like lately.
6546480	6549760	And I've always been just a really fully authentic person
6549760	6553920	regardless of what happens, what happens will happen,
6553920	6557040	you know, and otherwise it'll just make yourself sick.
6557040	6559400	Yeah, I mean, this is going to sound cornball
6559400	6561320	like I'm like Geraldo and I'm capitalizing
6561320	6563480	and I don't want to get points for it.
6563480	6564320	So I want to stretch, like,
6564320	6566400	I can't protect you from anybody.
6566400	6568920	I can't protect myself from myself or anybody else,
6568920	6571360	but I can guarantee you this.
6571360	6573440	And maybe what's important is that we all guarantee this
6573440	6575640	to each other and each chance we get is that
6575640	6578760	you can't say anything to me that's going to make me
6579720	6583520	suddenly start to realize you're a bad person.
6583520	6588520	Except lies, like if I find out that you said one thing
6588800	6591320	and then I find out you're capable of dishonesty
6591320	6594080	because that makes you dangerous because,
6594080	6596520	but I can forgive you if you then later tell me,
6596520	6600000	I lied to you about this and that.
6600000	6603760	But if you tell me the truth,
6603760	6606960	I am never going to punish you for it.
6606960	6610280	I'm never going to like, unless it's an accident,
6610280	6612600	unless you go like, can I tell you something?
6612600	6615200	I put peanut butter on my pussy the other day.
6615200	6617360	And I might accidentally go,
6617360	6618800	whoa, that's fucking nuts.
6618800	6620960	And you burst into tears and go,
6620960	6623840	the word nuts is what they said to me when I'm like,
6623840	6626280	and that shit could happen.
6626280	6628000	I could step on your foot while we're dancing,
6628000	6632680	but I am never, I'm never gonna go,
6632680	6634760	well, you shouldn't be danced with,
6634760	6636840	you don't belong on this dance floor.
6636840	6639520	You should, you know, and so like,
6639520	6643000	if nowhere else other than your therapist's office,
6643000	6645440	please consider this an actual definition,
6645440	6648400	not a political definition of a safe place.
6648400	6650560	It's not, nowhere is safe,
6650560	6654480	but you're safe from us up here for sure.
6655520	6657680	Cross the threshold,
6657680	6660560	blurt, semi-fictional shit
6660560	6661960	that you haven't even explored yet.
6661960	6665360	If you want to, you run the risk of people on the Reddit
6665360	6670040	going, but not us,
6670040	6672440	we will hold you on our shoulders
6673400	6676080	because what can we accomplish with this podcast
6676080	6679880	if not corrupting a new generation?
6679880	6681080	Celebrating honesty.
6682280	6684400	And I guess that invitation goes for you too, Asa,
6684400	6686680	but I don't know if I trust you yet.
6686680	6688240	What can I do to earn your trust?
6688240	6690560	Well, I have a suspender thing
6690560	6692160	because I'm like, what's wrong with a belt?
6692160	6693000	But then I was just like,
6693000	6694600	No, suspenders are more convenient.
6694600	6697080	Okay, all right, Asa, I'm an advocate.
6697080	6699040	Thank you, I appreciate that.
6699040	6701960	No, I'm kidding, it's probably a bad joke
6702000	6704800	because my whole point is we have to trust each other.
6704800	6705640	I trust you.
6705640	6707280	Caroline?
6707280	6708120	What, yeah.
6708960	6709920	Happy birthday.
6709920	6710920	Thanks.
6710920	6712640	Unless it turns out to not really be your birthday,
6712640	6713480	I trust you.
6713480	6714400	Oh, it's my birthday.
6714400	6715240	And my past.
6715240	6716080	Yesterday, right?
6716080	6716920	Yeah.
6716920	6717760	Happy birthday.
6717760	6718600	It was yesterday?
6718600	6719440	Yeah, it was yesterday.
6719440	6720280	So it's not really your birthday?
6720280	6721120	It's not, but I wanted to get on stage.
6721120	6723960	This trust thing is getting off to a shit start.
6723960	6725960	Well, she told us it was yesterday.
6725960	6728240	She wasn't like, no, yeah, it's my birthday.
6728240	6729800	You know what we should do in the show?
6730440	6734240	You know, sometimes this makes us uncomfortable
6734240	6736640	because the show attracts a certain mind
6736640	6738760	that's gonna be averse to things
6738760	6740240	that feel like a revival tent
6740240	6745000	because that evokes thoughts of religion and dishonesty.
6745000	6747760	But it's a town meeting, this podcast,
6747760	6751320	and we should have a moment in the show
6751320	6753200	where we go, like we used to,
6753200	6755720	hey, anybody got something so pressing
6755720	6757520	that they really wanna talk about it
6758160	6762240	and come up and talk, and we'll get to know people.
6763480	6764400	Because we used to do that,
6764400	6767040	and then we, I don't know why we stopped.
6767040	6768160	You'd say like, who's having great pain,
6768160	6769000	who's having a great day,
6769000	6770040	but then sometimes you'd be like,
6770040	6772680	just anybody who really, really has something to say
6772680	6773520	or something.
6773520	6774640	Yeah, I think I maybe started to feel like,
6774640	6776280	well, we're not, it's not,
6776280	6778960	it's like, oh, are we forming a whack pack
6778960	6779800	like Howard Stern?
6779800	6781680	Are we like, is it just becoming
6781680	6784840	like a spectacle of some kind?
6784840	6787200	But that was never the audience's fault.
6787400	6788720	I think that was...
6788720	6791160	I think you just found a lot of the wrong people sometimes
6791160	6792480	when you were on tour.
6792480	6793320	Yeah.
6793320	6795320	I just recently re-listened to a bunch of stuff.
6795320	6798840	So I'm kind of like remembering a lot of those moments now
6798840	6800480	and being like, yeah, I think you just got
6800480	6802000	a couple of bad eggs along the way.
6802000	6804960	And I think in Los Angeles on a Monday night downtown,
6804960	6807480	we can probably trust that, yeah, it's a natural.
6807480	6808320	Well, it also got to a point,
6808320	6811160	and like we caught more fish than boots
6811160	6813800	by casting that net.
6813800	6815440	But like, they got to the point
6815440	6816440	where the front couple rose,
6816560	6818480	people are like boxing each other to try to be up there,
6818480	6820880	to kind of be like in the show.
6820880	6823680	I think people were expecting to be the next Spencer
6823680	6825320	or Adam Goldberg or whoever.
6825320	6829160	And it was getting a little frisky for my money.
6829160	6830440	That's the dream.
6830440	6832160	That's the dream for like almost,
6832160	6833920	I think a lot of people that listen to the podcast,
6833920	6834760	everyone. That's a bad dream.
6834760	6836320	Dreams of being Spencer, you know.
6836320	6837280	Do better.
6839400	6840240	Come on.
6841240	6843720	Spencer, Spencer, for those people having that dream,
6843720	6846640	tell them one thing you did this week for me
6846640	6847480	that de-glamorizes.
6847480	6849160	I dream about having a yacht.
6849160	6850000	What?
6850000	6851320	I dream about having a yacht.
6851320	6852520	Like you could think bigger than
6852520	6853360	being on a fucking podcast.
6853360	6855960	No, but I'm saying tell the people dreaming
6855960	6857960	of being the next Spencer,
6857960	6861320	one thing that you did this week for me
6861320	6864240	that will disabuse them of their fantasies.
6864240	6866840	Oh, um, hmm.
6867960	6868800	This week?
6868800	6869840	No, or recently.
6869840	6871480	Just, sorry.
6872200	6875280	Uh, I like my job.
6875280	6876960	All right, okay, sorry.
6876960	6878760	I didn't, I just thought you'd have a fun,
6878760	6881640	I mean, you have to do so much specific like tedious shit.
6881640	6882480	I just thought it was funny.
6882480	6883880	I really like most of that stuff.
6883880	6884720	It's fun.
6884720	6886560	I feel activated and good.
6886560	6887760	Yeah, I like that stuff too.
6887760	6889240	Just like.
6889240	6890600	Oh yeah, Spencer's healthy now.
6890600	6893920	He had to oversee the hard installation
6893920	6897120	of Tesla software onto my car
6897120	6899960	that wasn't coming through Wi-Fi fast enough for me.
6899960	6900800	Yeah.
6900800	6902440	Spencer, are you self-actualized now?
6902440	6903280	No, no.
6903280	6906400	Okay, I just, I will follow your Instagram
6906400	6908600	so I know you've been going through this whole fitness thing
6908600	6911040	and it's like, wow, he might be reaching.
6911040	6913120	I've always been healthier than most,
6913120	6914760	even at my unhealthiest.
6915720	6916560	Nice.
6916560	6918560	And not arrogant at all.
6918560	6920040	That's not arrogant.
6920040	6921120	I'm not gonna say show it,
6921120	6922960	because I don't want, that's good.
6922960	6924400	It doesn't show up.
6924400	6925400	I got like.
6925400	6926680	He sent a text saying that.
6926680	6928360	I'm comfortable telling friends.
6928360	6930240	I think I have a six pack.
6931520	6934520	It's not, I can't, it doesn't show up on film.
6934520	6936880	It doesn't show up on film
6936880	6940320	and it doesn't show up except under the right lighting.
6940320	6943440	And when those things are no longer true
6943440	6946560	and it actually shows up, then I will show it.
6946560	6947840	And it'll be soon,
6947840	6950560	because the progress I've been making is encouraging.
6950560	6951400	Cliffhanger!
