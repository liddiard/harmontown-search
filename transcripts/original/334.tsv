0	16000	Hello. Check. One, two, two. How's it going, gang?
16000	32760	Do I need a house? Oh, boo. Hello, gang. From MacArthur Park, near downtown Los Angeles.
32760	37560	MacArthur Park, which is melting in the dark. And I'll never have a recipe again. If no
37560	43880	one knows what I'm talking about, go and listen to the Richard Harris version of MacArthur
43880	49280	Park, song written by Jimmy Webb. It is the fucking weirdest song in the world. And it's
49280	54920	about old dudes playing Chinese checkers across the street. But I digress. Harmon Town is
54920	72880	now in session. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, everybody. What's good, Spencer? I don't know,
72880	88560	I know it's kind of good. Sometimes great. Our mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon. Yeah, I know. I can recognize
88560	95080	less applause than for Spencer. I know what it sounds like. I'm happy to see him, too. I also felt
95080	100040	like I got less applause. Not that I deserve it. Who? I don't know. I get the last applause. It's
100040	105240	my fault I gave lackluster intro. Spencer Crittenden. I'm glad you brought that up. I'm glad to
105240	109120	hear you say it. Both of you go back. Because if I ever accused you of doing it, I'd be the biggest
109120	113760	dick in the world. But I do think that you taper. I think you handicap your intro. I don't want to
113760	118160	make the audience try again. That seems rude to me. Yeah, I know. Then they're like, oh, so the
118160	123600	shit goes on all the way down to us where we're at. Now we're at SeaWorld. Come on. I can't hear
123600	130880	you. This is a dying whale. Pretend it's not dying. Leave them alone. Let them be in the splash
130880	137880	zone of comfort. I wasn't trying to handicap your intro. I actually made the mistake of thinking
137880	143640	that if I just really laid it down subtly, that there would be kind of a weird like... I've never
143640	149040	thought that you were doing anything deliberately. Yeah. I miss you and I love you. It's good to see
149040	152160	you again. It's good to see you again. I miss you. I miss both of you. How's things? What have I missed?
152240	156720	I don't know. I mean, we only ever see each other. The three of us appear. It's true. Let's talk about
156720	162720	Spencer's beard trim. I got it. Yeah. Oh, shit. I was going to ask you if you lost weight, but just
162720	168560	your hair lost weight. I lost like 30 pounds of beard hair. Did you keep it for like the Smithsonian
168560	177280	or anything? I kept it for wizard spells. It looks good. You look like a very successful almond
177280	185120	brother. Thanks. That's what I was going for. He's the least talented almond brother. He's the one
185120	191040	that booked all their gigs. He's got all the publishing rights. Oh, Tikey Almond. Put up all
191040	200400	the flyers when he was 20. Guys, come on. Greg, Tyler. I don't even know the almond brother. I
200400	205200	don't know either. I know one's name Greg. Name one more almond brother than Greg and you went
205520	211120	toaster. But you're the one that played tambourine and booked the gigs. That's good. That sounds like
211120	216880	me. That's a very big compliment when it comes to self-care because the other almonds are like,
216880	222960	who cares? I'd rather die. You know that? That's part of your limited knowledge of the almond
222960	228640	brothers because I'm at zero. I really don't know. I'm projecting. It sounds like they play music.
228640	234000	Yeah, they play music and they're brothers. That's interesting. All right. Can we talk about
234000	240800	your tomorrow? I'm getting surgered. Yeah. You're going in for surgery. Yeah. Yeah. I was feeling
240800	246240	okay about it until the anesthesiologist called me and it was like, you're going to be in pain,
246240	251760	but we're hoping to get you from a sharp, stabbing, ripping pain to a dull, throbbing pain. I was like,
251760	257120	Jesus Christ. During the surgery or? Well, it wasn't specific. And so, yeah, I don't know. And
257120	262000	then I remembered my roommate was like, Oh yeah. The last time I got surgery, they said, you woke
262000	266880	up and we're crying out in pain, but she didn't remember it. And I'm like, I don't know. I guess
266880	271200	it's a little better to not remember it, but it still seems terrible to go through. What are you
271200	276640	getting surgered? What am I getting surgered? My hip, my left hip, which is great. Cause lately,
276640	282800	my right hip has been hurting. So yeah. What is it? Is it bone shearing kind of stuff or what's going
282800	290000	on? I got, let's see, femoral acid tabular impingement, which means, you know, the I've,
290000	294480	it's a great story. I've told it a lot of times that the, you know, that the hip is a ball and
294480	300960	socket joint, Jeff. Yeah. And the ball is not shaped right. It's got too much ball going on.
300960	304720	And so they're going to get rid of some of the ball and then hopefully it's not going to
304720	308640	pop out. We'll pop out. It's too violent. It kind of, it kind of gets strained. You know,
308640	312720	like when you have a, uh, an action figure and you kind of pull his arm too much back and it
312720	317520	comes a little bit out of the joint, but it's not popped out. That happens. And when that happens,
317520	323440	it grinds the soft tissues, not unlike a meat grinder slamming your door into a car into a,
323440	326960	or it's slamming your hand into a door. It's identical to what Cody. Yeah,
326960	330960	she has it on the other end, right? The, she has the socket rather than the ball,
330960	335200	right? Something like that. Yeah. Something's misshapen. So the mortar and the pestle are
335200	341120	just grinding cartilage. Yeah. So she tried. And I know it's fucked up, but we're all dying. Yeah.
341120	345200	But it's better that we just fucking deal with it. It actually uplifts us. Like allegedly,
345280	348640	like we're melting, we're dying. You know what you gotta get? You gotta get that CBD.
352240	360160	Tonight's episode is brought to you by Charlotte's web. Just throw a little CBD on that. We can't
360160	366320	tell you why because it's not legal to do so, but do it. What are they cutting open? They're going
366320	371120	to, my understanding is they're going to, they're going to make a slight incision on the hip pump
371120	377200	the opening full of saline, such to separate the muscle fibers without slicing them apart.
377200	383360	And then going through the gaps, not unlike a submarine traversing the barrier reef.
383360	388640	Is that something submarines or traverse? They'll get in there. They'll grind down. They'll suck
388640	396720	out the bones. They'll take all the shredded, suck out the bones. I'm not, I'm now. You suck
396720	401760	out the bones for Henry Jones. Cause Henry Jones don't eat no meat. Don't suck out the bones.
401760	406880	Don't suck out the bones. You've taken a Hippocratic oath to not suck out bones.
406880	410240	You suck them out. Like, like, like they're actually like going to jack them out. Well,
410240	414240	they're going to get a Dremel in there. They're going to grind away at the bones. And then that'll,
414240	418240	that'll leave not sawdust, but bone dust. If you're, if you're at a Tony Roma's,
418240	423120	if you're at a Tony Roma's rip joint, suck out the bones. If you're a doctor on the bones,
423280	427120	well, you can suck out the marrow. You can suck out the bone. You can suck out the bones.
428240	433040	If you cook the rib for long enough, you could suck the bones right out. So your socket,
433040	439680	your socket is what my socket's great. My ball is too big. It's oval. It's interesting to me that
439680	445040	there's a distinct that they draw a distinction because my fiance apparently has the opposite,
445040	449520	but it sounds identical. Right. Because if the ball and socket aren't working together,
449520	455600	how do you know which is the blame? Well, x-rays, you could just see, but you could,
455600	459760	you could fix the problem by changing either. Right. They're either working together or they're
459760	465840	not. Yeah. But I mean, it's, yeah, you could probably, but you'd be, you know, there's extra
465840	470320	bone somewhere. So you want to take out the extra bone. You could take out the normal bone to make
470320	475520	way for the extra bone, but that's probably degrading the structural integrity of the bone.
475520	480160	I'm sure it is. There's an ideal. Yeah. What am I doing? I want these people to go to eight years
480160	487040	of school. Right. I don't want to know more than them. General anesthesia for this. Yeah.
487040	492880	Good. I'm hoping to die. It's weird. Cause they always say, they say there's like a chance. If
492880	497200	you go under, you won't come up. But like, if there's that good of a chance, I don't think they
497200	502080	do that. You know, I've said, and I asked you, you've been under before. Yeah. My wisdom teeth.
502080	507280	I got a butt thing. How many had a butt thing installed? Let's put it. Let's put a pin in your
507280	513600	butt thing. Right. How many people here have been, uh, absolutely under for a medical procedure. Uh,
513600	519680	okay. That's good. And you're all alive, huh? The whole entire fucking audience. Yeah. It's,
519680	523600	I think wisdom teeth is a pretty common one. You generally go under for that. I don't want to
523600	529440	high road you guys. You definitely go under, but I've had scopes. I don't know if your tooth
529440	534720	procedures count. I think that's more, no, but, but I, I, the thing, I, having gone through a
534720	540560	couple of, uh, scopes like endo, that's what I'm getting. Um, and I had to like, uh, they put a
540560	546800	slit, they did a biopsy thing. Um, they had to get some shit out of there. So twice now I've been
546800	554960	put under. Right. And I've come to realize that, uh, cause I remember, and I've, I've talked about
555040	559360	this on the show before, but it was like the first time as the anesthesiologist came to me and said,
559360	563280	do you have any questions? And they said, will I dream? And she said, nope. Nope. And it was such
563280	568240	a fast answer. And I was like, what the fuck is with the fast answer? Like, like, shouldn't it be
568240	572880	subjective? Shouldn't shouldn't it be like, well, it depends on your religion. Well, um, I have some
572880	577120	answers for that. There's different kinds of sleep. And, and when I, when I smoked a lot of
577120	582080	weed, I stopped dreaming. And apparently when there's drugs, like, uh, like the, what do you
582080	587520	call it? What's the night? The sleeping drug that everyone takes CBD, bro. No, not melatonin. It's
587520	594800	like the butterfly Netflix, Lunesta. Let's say, um, yeah, Netflix. It's one of those. That's right.
594800	598960	That's where you have a potato chip and poop. Oh, no, that's Olestra. Oh, okay.
602880	608800	This just becomes the dad hour. But there's those drugs that put you to sleep. They help you sleep
608800	613440	in whatever. And those apparently aren't good because they put you do bad sleep and you don't
613440	617520	get rest out of it. You kind of need to go into deep sleep and then go into REM sleep to actually
617520	622160	repair your brain or remove brain plaques or whatever good sleep is doing for you. But the,
622160	625600	when you're taking drugs that make you not dream and stuff, it doesn't give you that kind of sleep.
625600	629360	It's a different kind of sleep. You're just like unconscious or whatever. And it's not,
629360	633760	that's not good. You want to have good sleep. So it's, they are inducing that kind of sleep and
633760	637200	just in good sleep, they're inducing bad sleep. So you're not dreaming and that's why they have
637200	645280	such a firm answer. Okay. Well, okay. Well, so, but the good sleep, bad sleep, I mean,
645280	650480	good sleep is cause you're still alive. Bad sleep is you're the equivalent of dead. Like,
650480	654480	like, like, like that was very comforting to me. The second time I did a procedure where they put
654480	660080	me under and then I came back and I was like, what the fuck? What in the way, why am I dressed
660080	665120	like this? Oh, they cut you open the thing. And then I, and then driving home, I'm like,
665120	667280	can't wait to get a drink. Can't wait to get back to my shitty life. You're not supposed to
667280	670320	drive yourself home after that, by the way. Yeah. Somebody else was supposed to drive you home.
670320	674960	That's like the rule. I'm like in the Uber and I'm like, take me to the drawing room. And the guys
674960	679920	like, you're not supposed to drink after I'm like, take me before my fuck before this fades away. I
679920	687040	want to combine it with everything on the top shelf. Um, and part of it is because it's like,
687040	698880	uh, there is to me, I do feel like, um, I feared death at 10 to 30% more before I had had these
698880	703920	experiences where they go, we're going to do this thing. We got to work on your throat and we don't
703920	708560	want you to sue us. So we're going to put you in a state where you're never going to sue us. Right.
708560	714720	And the state where you're never going to sue anybody is kind of death. They figured out how
714720	720320	to put you in a state that just makes you not exist. It doesn't make you dream. It doesn't make
720320	726560	anything that your fiance would say to you, make you go like, yeah, they don't want that during
726560	733680	surgery. So you're, you're being put by corporate America into a state called death. And then they're
733680	738960	bringing you back out of death. So while that's not necessarily a good power for them to have,
738960	745200	it is like, it is comforting for me when I think about it, I go like, yeah, Oh God, what if,
745200	749680	what if God doesn't exist? I'm like, motherfucker, you know what happens if God doesn't exist. It's
749680	756560	called, it's called everything that led up to that surgery minus all the shit that happened after.
757920	763120	That's it. That ain't so bad. Right. That's what I'm afraid of though. That, that to me,
763120	767040	that is so bad. You know what I found? It's so bad in a philosophical sense. Well,
767040	771120	you've done a lot. You've done a lot done. I'm just like, it's not, it's not Vietnam.
771760	776400	It's like, it's not like, well, it's like whatever happens before you go into that state,
776400	782560	it's like, ah, Tommy, I can't feel my legs. No, it's all right. Remember the Bronx pizza. Oh,
782560	787840	shit. But my intestines like that's all life. That's life. That's not death. There's nothing
787840	793040	to fear about death. There's a story of a, of like, of a, like a famous, like, he's famous,
793120	796640	but like a hiker who wrote the thing and he would, uh, he would go in these giant like,
796640	801760	like mountain hiking trips and he would bring one long novel to read. And every page he read,
801760	805680	he would tear the page off to lighten the weight of, of what, what, what he, you know,
805680	809280	like what he's carrying as he goes along. So he's reading his book and he's like, why,
809280	813120	why have the rest of the pages behind you that you're not going to read again? Like you just,
813120	816000	he would just tear the pages and throw them away as he, as he hiked along.
816000	818400	He's like the last shit I'm ever going to read. I don't give a shit.
818400	822960	Yeah. It's like, I'd rather carry a light book and like, like everything before me is the first
822960	825520	page of the book that I'm reading and everything else has already happened.
825520	828880	And did anyone, I mean, everyone right now is going like, what the,
828880	836240	how in the fuck are you littering at this time? Like, like just because you're there and there's
836240	841520	like no cops, you're just like fucking, okay. Yeah. I, I bring a bag of French fries. I do
841520	846960	the same thing. I like throw a fucking McNugget wrapper laying the load.
847280	849840	He is a papers by her degradable.
850400	854560	I just think the one, one man's poet is another man's shithead.
855280	857920	Look, the first thing I thought too is like litter bug.
857920	862400	What are you doing? Like, like, like, do you want, like, what, what if other people 20 years
862400	866480	from now want to be the guy that's never been here before? And they're like, what is this shit?
866480	872320	There's a hustler pages everywhere. That's a pictorial about a waitress peeing in a guy's mouth.
872320	875200	Why was his, why, why did he take a eat, love, pray?
876800	879280	Bring something fucking heavy. Skinny legs and all.
879280	883040	Tim Robbins just wishes he was Kurt Vonnegut. I don't want to fight Tom Robbins.
883040	886640	Sorry. You know, you know, it scared me or not didn't scare me scared, but like kind of
886640	892240	alarmed me after the fact when I had my vocal surgery, it was, I was under, I was up at like
892240	895760	an hour and a half later. Everything was fine. Everything was groovy. They told me I would
895760	901040	need a wheelchair. Uh, so that like church could drive me home. I had to be come out in a wheelchair.
901040	905920	I was, I stood up. I was finally like, you good to walk? I'm like, yeah, I'm fine. And, um,
905920	913120	I didn't realize that they had drawn and with a Sharpie and X on the side of my neck. I'm like,
913120	917200	what is that about? And they go, Oh, that was just to make sure the doctors know what side to cut
917200	922480	into. Right. Cause otherwise they're so good at their job that they'll just fuck right up.
923440	927680	We trust them to kill us and bring us back to life, but they don't know what sides are.
928640	932160	They're going to be putting a camera and a laser beam down my throat and they want to make sure
932160	936640	that the laser beaming the right side of my neck, but it was just a good old fashioned X marks the
936640	941040	spot on the outsides. They go, Oh, we're doing left side today. That's that's, that's like,
942080	946960	that's a little too analog for my fucking ball. I'll, I'll, I've said it before. I'll say it again.
946960	952800	And the socket doctors are serial killers with support systems. That's their privileged serial
952800	961360	killers. I like, like, like a Jeffrey Dahmer might've been a head chief of staff. Uh, but he grew
961360	969920	up in Milwaukee. God bless him. He was just trying to make AI speaking. I read the podcast. Uh, yeah.
971120	974880	I asked somebody, I was, I was in Milwaukee like four or five days ago and I asked somebody like,
974880	978000	you guys have the most serial killers. They go, no, that's Washington. I mean, they're proud of
978000	983200	that. That's like, we're Australia or like, you guys have so many poison spiders. So like 30% of
983200	987840	our spiders aren't poisonous. Like no one's supposed to know that you're not supposed to
987840	992720	have that reaction. All right. Anyways, uh, let's, let's, let's get to our guest. Uh, we can talk to
992720	999280	him about, uh, all this and more. Um, uh, I, I, I, it's a complicated relationship because I'm like,
999280	1004320	I'm like in this new age of like everyone's, I can touch people. I can, I can hurt them. I can
1004320	1009200	judge them. I can like, it's, I can be a fan. I can like, whatever. I don't know. And I'm in the
1009200	1014720	true crime podcast. We, we flew the red handed ladies out from, from, from London and we're,
1015920	1020880	it was a blessing and we've had a good time. And then I'm like, like in the, I don't know,
1020880	1025680	I talk about the shit I listened to on podcasts and I'm like, oh, I've been talking about this guy,
1025680	1029520	Asperger detective. And then they're like, you hurt me, go through on this podcast where I'm like,
1029520	1034240	well, I probably shouldn't call him that. That's good. That seems like bullying. Uh,
1034240	1038640	because if you like, like the guy in the meantime, we've become fans and all this stuff like this.
1038640	1044240	Anyways, he's here. Uh, um, and he's amazing. Please welcome, uh, Ryan Kraus from, uh,
1049920	1051600	from cold case mystery murders,
1052560	1055680	Mr. Kids, I didn't even get that right. Cold case mystery files,
1058240	1061040	cold case murder mysteries. Uh,
1062400	1067120	so it's cold case mystery, cold case murder, murder, murder, cold case. Hello,
1067120	1071680	Ryan. How are you doing, man? I definitely, nobody expected you to look like Michael checklists.
1071680	1077520	That's not, and that's the biggest compliment in the world. I told you last night we had dinner
1077600	1083840	and I'm like, like Michael checklists is everyone's catch offer. You shave your head and work out.
1084720	1088320	Like I, I would have said he looks more like, like that one judge that you really want to
1088320	1095840	impress on a cooking show. Anyway, sorry. That's it. It's rude to bring you out here,
1095840	1099760	but you got to use a little more salt in this man. You gotta, anyway, sorry. How are you?
1099760	1106480	How was your trip? Thank you for driving out here. Oh, great. Yeah. Yeah. You, you drove here from
1106480	1111200	Phoenix. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately. Yeah. You're going to, you're going to have to eat that mic.
1111200	1116240	We have to tell everyone. Yeah. It's the worst. Like this. I'm so close. He's going to be this
1116240	1121360	close. Okay. Otherwise people will be like, I hated him. I hate you. No more far away guests.
1121360	1125760	Why was that guy so far away? And we're like, he wasn't far away. You're a Phoenix native or
1125760	1130480	residence? Uh, no, I just moved away from LA actually about six months ago, unfortunately.
1130480	1136000	But so you fled LA and you've moved to Arizona. Uh, yeah. I was like, I had a corporate job and
1136000	1140960	the podcast and I could only really keep one. So I had to let something go and I was in Santa Monica.
1140960	1149520	So I let go of the corporate job and yeah, I just had to do my thing. I do love, I love those stories.
1149520	1153840	Like when you get into true crime podcasts, you're like invested in people that have a certain amount
1153840	1160720	of Patreon subscribers. And then hopefully, usually there's like a moment where they're like,
1160800	1166320	guys, if, if enough of you helped me, I can actually stop delivering pizza or whatever.
1166320	1170720	And you kind of like, you experienced this sort of like, you get to watch a million Stan Lee's,
1170720	1175200	like create a million Spider-Man's kind of, but it's like, it's a healthy, you know, in a healthy
1175200	1180640	level. Uh, so I, and I heard that episode where you're like, you're telling your origin story of
1180640	1186320	working in cubicles and stuff. And it was, it was pretty, pretty deep and electric. It was really,
1186320	1190640	I, it was more than I expected. Yeah. I don't even know if I remember that. There's an underlying
1190800	1195040	thing to you. We should talk about this later though. Cause we should, like, where you, you,
1195040	1203840	you kind of God, or I mean, great. Thank you, Steve. I just don't understand why it can't happen
1203840	1211200	earlier. Well, I'll tell you why. Cause I didn't text him yet. Oh, you texted. I had to. So he keeps
1211200	1215680	dropping the ball. He keeps dropping the ball before your surgery and you're in charge of ice.
1215680	1219440	Well, I gotta be in charge of ice going forward. It's going to be a big part of my life for a couple
1219440	1230160	weeks. That's just true. Um, anyways, so let's talk, let's talk, can we talk about your origin
1230160	1237120	story? Like you going from working stiff to true crime podcaster. Okay. Yeah. Let's do that.
1238000	1242160	Which part are we going to talk about? I don't know. Like give, give us the rough edges. You
1242160	1247280	don't have to, I heard an episode where you talk about the, there was like a, there was like a whole
1247360	1251840	thing. You don't have to talk about that by an episode or was it the one before it? Uh,
1251840	1256400	I think that was a free episode. Yeah, it could have been, but, but, but just give us the,
1256400	1261040	I don't know. Like you, you, why are you interested in true crime? Why did you start
1261040	1265120	a true crime podcast? That kind of thing. I'm a bad interviewer. Just help me out.
1265120	1270240	The true crime thing started way back in the day. I mean, my mom was watching unsolved mysteries
1270240	1274880	all the time. I don't know if anybody's a fan of unsolved mysteries, but like constantly. So
1274960	1279280	I was always just in the house and I would hear about true crime and he's unsolved things. And I
1279280	1282720	just started becoming interested in that. And I think for me, it was like, Oh,
1282720	1285760	how do these people's brains work? Why do these people kill?
1285760	1289760	Being sociopaths, like the criminals. Yeah. I mean, it was, I wanted to know about everybody's
1289760	1294960	brain and why is this person is psychopath or a sociopath. And what do you think is isolating
1294960	1300880	that? Like what is it fear? Like, like, is it fascination when we watch? Cause I think it's
1300880	1305680	linked to why we watch movies about mafia people, werewolves. Like, like we,
1305680	1311120	we have this fascination. Oh, these people are sociopaths. Is it, is it like I'm scared?
1311120	1312080	Werewolves just get bit.
1313600	1320000	Is it, is it, I'm scared. I'm like them. Or is it, I'm so scared of them. I need to understand them
1320000	1324400	to like, I think it's both of those things. I mean, I think to a certain extent, all of us have
1325040	1330720	some type of sociopathic tendencies and we noticed that in our behavior. And sometimes we're ashamed
1330720	1337040	of it. We try to get away from it, but, um, you know, I think there is some darkness in all of us,
1337040	1343120	um, whether it ever comes out or not. And for me, that was the fascination was just, you know,
1343120	1348880	am I like this? Who is like this? Why are they like this? Why are they more like this than me?
1348880	1357120	Yeah. Yeah. Why is this person considering themselves like a candidate for driving
1357120	1362240	their children into a river and jumping out of the car and blaming it on a random
1362240	1368160	minority? Like, why did they just think that was okay to do? Which of them got away with it?
1368160	1371680	Why did they get away with it? What did they do when they were in police custody? Like,
1371680	1376320	it extends to all of that. When you watch the TV shows, like I'm, you know, I watched the forensic
1376320	1382320	files and the, uh, the date lines and stuff like that. And, uh, the cops frequently go, yeah, you
1382320	1385920	know, they, they always think they're smarter than us. You know, this guy thought he knew all the
1385920	1391280	angles, but like, I wonder how many people that are really smart actually do know all the angles
1391280	1397440	and get away with it. It's like, they kind of are smarter than you. A lot of them because you guys
1397440	1403520	do it every day. And we were talking about this at dinner last night, how like, like, like, I don't
1403520	1408880	know what the percentage is, but the, I think the difficult thing for cops who I am, I am my fan of
1408880	1413120	true crime is like making me a big fan of homicide detectives. Cause Jesus Christ, if you think
1413200	1417600	working at Kinko's is hard, like it's like, like, like, like this, this like idea that they have to
1417600	1421440	work with these people and they have to get confessions out of them. And then half of the
1421440	1427040	time they, if they successfully get a confession, it's like, you asshole, he's not guilty. And
1427040	1432880	they're like, but I only did what I, they're like, so most of the time they're lying. Um, and, uh,
1432880	1439200	but they, they like, it's like a lot of times like you, you watch like forensic files and,
1439200	1442640	uh, the cops will talk about their techniques and they'll go,
1444160	1450640	they'll, they'll leverage the fact that the average person, given an average person that
1450640	1455600	commits a murder, like that, they'll, they'll be leveraged by the idea that the cop wants to be
1455600	1460960	their friend, for instance, that they'll be like, Oh, don't, you seem like a smart guy.
1460960	1465440	And the person will respond to the thing. Like, I don't think you want to be dishonest. Like,
1465440	1469200	I think you want to do right by the mother of the victim and stuff. And it's like that,
1469200	1474720	that impulse to like not let the cop down. Yeah. They're seeking validation and the cops know that.
1474720	1479200	Yeah. They tend to just feed right into that. And whatever they see that is, whatever they see is
1479200	1484160	lacking within that person, whatever the desperation is that caused them to commit the crimes.
1484160	1489840	That's generally what they go after. That's just what an abuser does, uh, is notice, notice what
1489840	1494080	the person, what pushes the person as well. It tries to feed into that to manipulate them.
1494080	1499120	But you're kind of an abuser abuser when you're, when you, when you suspect that, uh, a person is
1499120	1503360	yeah. And it's like, that's the thing is like, I don't know what I haven't heard cops talk a lot
1503360	1507920	about on these true crime shows. The ones that I love, cause they have cops involved. Like they
1507920	1513280	don't, it's like, there aren't any rules when you're dealing with sociopaths. I like your show
1513280	1519040	cause you talk a lot about your, you talk about sociopaths in what seems to me to be the right
1519040	1524880	way. Cause it's like, I don't want to praise them. I don't think they're better than us at the same
1524880	1530240	time. I don't think, I don't think we should pretend that they're like, they don't exist. But
1530240	1536240	like, I like that you're kind of like, you're always like, this guy's a fucking idiot. That's
1536240	1542400	the thing is he thinks he can just, he's such a sociopath. He's going to call 911 and just make
1542400	1547920	up a murder story. And here's the thing. You can't do that. That's really hard for people that make
1547920	1553920	them up for a living to do. It's so much anything on television. It doesn't work. And the people that
1553920	1558240	are great at that, the people that are great at making the perfect fake 911 call or whatever,
1558240	1562400	they end up being so proud of themselves that they can't wait to tell everybody that they hang out
1562400	1569360	with. Man, I fucking, I called 911. It is true. They're so proud of themselves about it. What is,
1570320	1575360	can you tell me the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath? You know, that I've actually
1575360	1581040	made up my own rules about that because I'm crazy. I'd love to hear it. Yeah. As far as a sociopath
1581040	1586240	goes, well, psychopath, first of all, psychopath, we think of as a puppet master. So they're
1586240	1591680	generally people who use their resources as a puppet master over something or somebody else in
1591680	1596000	that matter. So think of like there were the case of Michelle Carter. I don't know if anybody's
1596000	1601840	familiar with that. She was the one who had the boyfriend who committed suicide or her urging. She
1601920	1606480	sent him hundreds of texts saying, kill yourself now, do it now, do it now. Because she had that
1606480	1611920	emotional power over him. John Wayne Gacy, somebody like that, another classic psychopath. He's a guy
1611920	1618160	who was offering jobs that paid much more than anybody else would pay for labor. So he was able
1618160	1622320	to get young men to do things they wouldn't normally do. And they took a lot of risks and
1622320	1626720	they would stick around his home because if they didn't, they couldn't make that money. And so he
1626720	1631360	was more of a puppet master like that. But with the sociopath, I generally think of them more as
1631360	1636000	leeches. And so what they're doing is they're manipulating you for your resources rather than
1636000	1641840	using theirs to control you. They're generally lazier. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. They're considered
1641840	1649200	fringe characters. Sociopaths settle. Sometimes they take the spotlight because of where they
1649200	1653920	landed. That's like, who would have expected a sociopath to become CEO of this company? And
1653920	1659040	then it's like, whoa, this sociopath is the star of the show. But it's only really because of the
1659040	1664400	situation they landed in, combined with the fact that a sociopath is like a jellyfish. They're
1664400	1670720	like, I'll do whatever I can to survive. I have no fucking empathy. And a psychopath has a little bit
1670720	1677760	of an itch. It's like, I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and it's pretty boring. Like, what do I got to do
1677760	1683280	to make this interesting? They have a little bit of a... Are there psychopaths that actually just like
1683360	1689600	gamblers will take terrible risks to make stupid bets because they get a kick out of the action,
1690320	1695200	they call it, right? Are there psychopathic murderers and criminals? I'm sure there are,
1695200	1702800	that do it simply for that kind of adrenaline thing? Or is it the simple idea that they feel
1702800	1709040	that they're allowed to because they have that status? Yeah, I mean, the psychopath is generally
1709040	1713040	just known for having no regard for anybody else. And so that's why there's sometimes good
1713040	1720400	corporate CEOs and things of that nature. I read that they're more comfortable drifting,
1720400	1725680	that a psychopath is like a coconut. They're like, they contain everything they need.
1725680	1731920	Like a psychopath could go years just wandering around. And a sociopath actually gets anxious
1731920	1737120	about like, I don't know, I feel like I don't even have a family. Like, even though they don't actually
1738080	1744480	empathize with, but they feel anxiety about uprooting and wandering. And a psychopath is
1744480	1749200	like, actually, the open road is the only place to be. That's one thing that I read.
1750640	1755120	Are there other classifications beyond psychopath and sociopath for the people that you
1755120	1760160	like profile on your show? Yeah, I mean, there are plenty of subcategories and things of that
1760160	1765280	nature. But I mean, those are generally the two major classifications. What kind of... If you
1765280	1772960	murder someone for any reason other than food or them trying to make you food, you might be a
1772960	1780800	retina. I mean, if you murder someone, are you automatically a sociopath? Can you be like
1780800	1786480	retrodiagnosed as a sociopath? No, not necessarily. I mean, you could just be somebody who flipped
1786480	1791840	out at any moment and killed someone. It could be an anger issue. For sociopaths, generally,
1791840	1795760	what I believe they've been created to do, I believe that their brains have been created
1795760	1802320	specifically to not allow them to make adjustments in their narrative as far as what they do on a
1802320	1806400	daily basis. So a lot of detectives will tell you that when you're dealing with a sociopath,
1807600	1812720	generally what happens is they have a very rigid logic. And so they follow that logic
1812720	1817760	and they don't veer from it at all. The detectives? Yeah, well, no, the sociopath. I knew that.
1818080	1824080	Because by not veering from the logic, they will continue to make mistakes again and again and
1824080	1830160	again up until... Because they've written a story in their mind that can't be deviated from.
1830160	1835200	Yeah, and there's a lot of denial involved. And the reason the denial is involved is because,
1835200	1838960	like you're saying, they can't deviate from the original plan. And so they will just follow
1838960	1843920	through even if the logic doesn't make sense. And the idea is the brain has been developed like that
1843920	1848240	specifically to put them in prison, but in the process, we're creating a lot of technology
1848240	1852800	related to detecting light and movement and things of that nature. They've been placed by
1852800	1859360	God as like debugging equipment. Oh, absolutely. That their job is to go through the highway map
1859360	1864880	and constantly try to turn right. Yes. And if they're able to, it either represents a place
1864880	1869920	where you need an on-ramp, as in Lizzie Borden possibly. You did a Lizzie Borden episode where
1869920	1877920	your take on it was very... I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but my brutish summation of
1877920	1884880	your take on Lizzie Borden was basically like, this is a woman who, if she was being denied the
1884880	1892400	things that she felt she deserved in 40 years difference, there wouldn't be as much question
1892400	1898560	about what she was entitled to. This was a woman who was being told at her place in time
1898560	1904480	that there's no... You're in a cell socially, like, oh, you're a spinster. You either need to
1904480	1909360	marry a man and submit to his will, or you need to do what your father says. And she was like,
1909360	1918560	psych, I have a hack for that. No pun intended. I have 30... Which is short for hatchet. Yes,
1918560	1926480	exactly. But, I mean, did I paraphrase you wrong? No, no, that's a great example. Not that these
1926480	1930560	people are gods or monsters or heroes or villains, but that sometimes their functionality
1930560	1937040	is a scrubbing bubble. That they're going, like, hey, there's a fucking... There's railings here
1937040	1944320	that a woman isn't allowed to do anything except chop a motherfucker. And we do. We do that.
1947200	1953520	That's why our history is such a roller coaster of criminals that become exonerated things.
1953520	1958080	Sometimes the sociopaths are like... It's like, oh, they're not a role model. However,
1958080	1962640	if it weren't for them, blibbidi-blue-blue. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a... The thing that
1962640	1967440	makes a sociopath special is that, like, for instance... He's writing it down. How do you
1967440	1972160	spell blibbidi-blue-blue? B-L-I-B-E-E-E-E. It's a two-piece, two-piece. Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.
1974160	1977120	I'm sorry. And I'm sorry I'm a bad interviewer, and I'm sorry for everything.
1978640	1983120	But Lizzie Borden... I don't even remember what I was gonna say. She was, like, what, 19-something,
1983840	1987680	in the past. And she was in a big house, and she killed her dad to get the house,
1987680	1990000	and she got away with it, more or less, is the theory. Yeah, she did get away with it.
1990000	1994800	Yeah, she killed her mom, too. Because... Right. Because she just was like,
1994800	1999040	ah, I was painting, and I got these clothes red with paint, and now I threw them out. And
1999040	2004400	it's not suspicious back then. And so, like, she was just exploiting the legal system or the system.
2005120	2009360	Yeah, she just totally exploited the legal system. It's something that happens on a daily basis now,
2009360	2013360	and because of incidents like that, and we were able to create better forensics,
2013360	2017600	we now have a better understanding of that. So that's really the purpose of the sociopath,
2017600	2022720	is to advance that technology over and over and over. So their faulty logic ensures,
2022720	2026320	when they want something and they can't get it, they'll engage criminality,
2026320	2030640	because there's just no other way to get it. So if you're Lizzie Borden, you're stuck in this house,
2030640	2034960	you don't get your father's money. He's healthy, and he's not going to die for a long time.
2035920	2039840	You basically just do whatever you have to do to make sure he's dead without even
2039840	2043600	worrying about the logic. And that's generally how the sociopath works.
2043600	2050080	So you have this thing that you do that other podcasters don't do, where you...
2050080	2053840	I have a lot of those. You do it fully nude.
2054720	2059760	Yes, yes. I actually requested to do this show nude, and Dan was like, I don't know.
2059840	2065280	Right. No, we can't. But you do... You kind of pick... I'm kind of curious about your process,
2065280	2069360	but you can tell me, no, that jumps the shark. I can't tell you exactly how I do it. But I'm
2069360	2078560	curious about how you pick a case, because part of your gimmick is you pretty much always go lateral.
2078560	2086240	I mean, for me as a consumer, the joy of true crime is that it's like...
2087120	2091520	These are all different personalities, but the canon is all the same, because it's true crime.
2092160	2095120	Everyone's going to do John Bonet Ramsey, and I want them to.
2096560	2100560	Because I want the same way that Shakespeare was just adapting... Whatever.
2100560	2108000	Harmon, shut up and just get to your point. My point is that your unique gimmick is that you
2108960	2113760	actually do kind of investigate these things. You pick cases that have
2114480	2121920	questionable resolutions, and you very proudly put a crown on your head and go,
2121920	2126880	like, look, here's the thing. I don't need any more information than I have. I don't know,
2126880	2130720	a lot of people talk about it. They wish this autopsy photo came back. But guess what? You
2130720	2137360	don't fucking need it. All you need to solve this case is to think about one thing. Evolution.
2137760	2147040	And it's either the... Cody at my fiancée, and I always go like... You always go like,
2147040	2151520	it's going to be one thing. It's either going to be evolution, resources, or redirection of light.
2152960	2159200	And I'm not mocking you, because you commit to that like a crazy kind of Columbo...
2160480	2166640	Detective, you're good at it. You do it well. What is redirection of light? Oh, yes. Please
2166640	2172880	explain this. It is. This is great. Well, we got some light redirection... Some ROL fans out there.
2172880	2177200	This is one of your big things. And for those who aren't indoctrinated, it's like,
2177200	2181760	I mean, you're constantly talking about redirection of light. Yeah. I mean, redirection of light can...
2182960	2187680	It's actually... I mean, it's just essentially just blocking the truth in some way. It can be
2187680	2191680	thought of in many ways. But I think one of the ways that I explained it recently, I covered the
2191680	2196320	Justin Ross Harris case, if everybody's familiar with that. It was a hot car death with his young
2196320	2201360	son. And he's in prison for it now. Is that the guy that left his kid in the car and then went to...
2202000	2207600	Yeah. He left his kid in the car when he went to work, instead of taking the kid to daycare.
2207600	2215040	And it was in Atlanta in June. And he claimed that his case was... I didn't know. I'm hearing
2215040	2220160	him periods. I forgot my kid was in the car. I took him to work. I went to work. And then we
2220160	2225840	went to lunch. And then my kid got cooked in a car. Yeah. So he had claimed that for seven hours,
2225840	2230800	he didn't think of his son. And you could see, by the way, that he had parked his vehicle
2230800	2235840	and the movements that he made coming in and out of the building, that he was intentionally avoiding
2235840	2240560	certain things and was positioning his vehicle in certain ways. And one of the... Like I said,
2240560	2246320	the sociopath is unable to see... Once he reaches the stage of denial, he's unable to see that he's
2246320	2251760	not making adaptations to his plan. And so one of the instances of redirected light that I talked
2251760	2258000	about was that he pulls the vehicle into the parking space by backing in because he wants to
2258000	2264000	be able to get out and not have to look into the back of the vehicle. So if he pulls in forward,
2264000	2269360	he has to get out and walk past the door where his son is in the car seat and he would see him.
2269360	2275520	So he intentionally backs in. But by backing in, what happens is he creates a situation where he
2275520	2279760	would have seen the kid in the back seat through the side mirror. I'm sorry. I don't quite follow
2279760	2284800	that. So if he parked in normally, he would have to... Are you saying he has to look over the back
2284800	2288480	seat to back out of the space and he would see the kid in the back seat? Where is the kid sitting,
2288480	2293440	front or back seat? The kid's in a car seat in the back. So let's say he would normally pull
2293440	2298640	in face first. And so every other vehicle in the parking lot is like that, except for his. His is
2298640	2302080	backed in. Because he doesn't want to walk past the back seat. He wants to walk forward. If he were
2302080	2307840	to pull forward, he has to get out and walk past the back seat and he'll see the car seat. So he
2307920	2312880	avoids doing that. But what he can't see as a sociopath is that he's actually redirecting
2312880	2318000	that light. And so what that means is that by parking the vehicle and backing it in,
2318000	2324000	what he's doing is he's creating a situation where he has to use the rear view and also the side
2324000	2328960	mirror in order to back into the spot. And while doing that, he would very clearly see his son.
2328960	2333360	He would have used more light to see the reflection of his son in the back seat of the car.
2333360	2338960	So in fact, hours later, that's how he actually says he sees his son. He says,
2338960	2342560	I was changing a lane. I looked in the mirror and I saw him in the back,
2342560	2346880	but he would have seen that when he parked the vehicle. He was not able to understand
2346880	2354000	that though. Sometimes you have flare ups like that. I remember you saying about that guy. You're
2354000	2358800	like, but this guy, and he says this, but here's the thing. I'm about to squash his fucking life
2358800	2365920	like a grape. You have little, not his life, but you probably said like his logic or something.
2366880	2374560	I love that about you that you're like, you have nerd hulk outs. And then also you're like,
2376000	2380400	I know half of you think I'm full of fucking shit, but here's the thing. You're fucking wrong.
2382640	2387520	So do you take, and now I can't wait to listen to the show. I'm sorry that I'm late to the game
2387520	2394080	on this, but like, do you take evidence that was already there and go, I picked that evidence for
2394080	2398320	me to go, that's the thing. Or do you put it all together and go, I'm going to make my own
2398320	2403920	extrapolation out of that and say, here's what I think that no detective had already landed on.
2403920	2408320	Yeah. I mean, I generally try to extract whatever the human brain is doing. So
2408320	2412960	if I look into the psychology, then I'll start analyzing the philosophy of it
2412960	2416400	and the sociology as well, and just go, just go off on a rant.
2416400	2421040	Right. So the car thing is like, he's creating plausible deniability almost, but creating
2421040	2426240	plausible deniability is someone, something a guilty person does so that they can then claim
2426240	2429760	they're getting away with it. So that gets back to the redirection of light. He's creating this
2429760	2435920	incident where he could pretend to be telling the truth, but he's actually engineering a dishonest
2435920	2439680	situation. And that has evidence that looks like a dishonest situation being created.
2439680	2446880	It takes energy to almost think like it's like when you were talking about, oh, he would have
2446880	2451520	looked in his rearview mirror and all that stuff. Actually, that pales in comparison to the fact
2451520	2459360	that if he pulled in headfirst to his parking spot every day and then that day backed in,
2459360	2465120	boom, you're done. Redirection of light, right? Because he's doing something specific that day
2465120	2472720	and he's doing it because what's on his mind is, I don't want anyone to perceive me as having
2472720	2477600	seen my baby. I think people that back in for no reason are fucking weird just to start with.
2477600	2482720	Oh, I do that. I do that because at the end of the day, I wanted to go home.
2485280	2490720	At the beginning of the day, I have more energy. I'm like, and then I want to...
2491520	2495120	To the start of the day, you've got so much energy. Oh, man, I can't wait to do a fucking
2495120	2498240	complicated maneuver and get into my thing. Yeah, because I want to pay it forward to my
2498240	2502560	grumpy self at the end of the day. It's like me saying, Grumpy Dan, get out of here.
2503200	2507360	It's five o'clock. Get out of here. Beat traffic. Thank you. Thank you.
2507360	2509440	Ryan, does that make him psychopath or sociopath?
2510960	2513280	I'm going to go with sociopath. Yeah, definitely.
2513280	2515920	Because I'm lazy. I think that is sociopathic.
2516160	2517840	No, I love your Instagram workouts.
2517840	2522960	I'm like, this is a way to... I want to talk about your...
2525520	2530320	Well, I do want to say this redirection of light thing or the thing that you do that's so specific,
2530320	2536720	I want to insert there because I have said on this podcast, even to other true crime people,
2536720	2541280	I'm like, you know the true crime story that really bums me out, that really freaks me out,
2541280	2545600	keeps me up at night was this Kanika Powell. Is it Kanika or Kanika?
2546480	2551360	It was the young lady who, the guy came to her door, he pretended he was a UPS guy and all
2551360	2556000	this stuff. There was like two guys and all this stuff. She was like... And then she ends up getting
2556000	2560080	shot and there's no robbery and all this stuff. It was just so disturbing to me because it felt...
2561520	2565680	It just filled me with anxiety. I'm like, why isn't there a task force? What is going on?
2566480	2573920	And he did an episode on it and it was like... As an example of how what you do can kind of
2573920	2577760	actually be beneficial, you have the same information that anyone else has, but you're
2577760	2584800	tracing it through and going, what do the guy or guys that are doing this shit to her have in
2584800	2592560	common? They're idiots. I mean, they're bad at their job. They're dumb, they're children.
2592560	2597120	They're trying to get into her apartment and they're doing a terrible job at it. They're
2597120	2604960	failing every step of the way. And then following that track, that explains her death in the end
2604960	2612160	because what happens to this poor young lady is she comes back, she's in her lobby of her own hotel
2612160	2619600	place and then all we know is that some guy shoots her and runs away. But the way that you break it
2619600	2627120	down is like, yeah, no, the same idiot children that were so desperate to have her in her apartment,
2628640	2634480	that desperation planted them like children, idiot children, where she lived, waited for
2634480	2640240	her to come back, did what idiot children would do. She reacted the way an adult would. They reacted
2640240	2644720	the way a child would because she wasn't going to go in a fucking apartment with a fucking child
2644720	2651280	with a gun that's been trying to get it. She's like, no, fuck you. I'm a military trained adult
2651280	2661120	and this person shot her and ran like a child. And that is why it's like, oh, her wallet wasn't
2661120	2664480	taken and all this stuff, which is the stuff that panicked me because I was like, this is a
2664480	2673200	professional hit. How are we ignoring this? The government killed her. And instead you're like,
2673200	2678240	no, this is all explained. And the guy that did it was active in that area and then stopped being
2678240	2682800	active. He's in prison right now. He did this kind of thing. He probably did that. He wouldn't
2682800	2690080	confess to it because that would add to his time. And it's all good. It's like your unique way of
2690080	2697120	looking at things actually had a... It was like, you solved the case for me. You made me sleep at night.
2697200	2703920	Do you think, Ryan, that not having listened to the show, and I will, I promise, that what you're
2703920	2708160	good at, like what makes your show good, do you think that you might be valuable as a resource
2708160	2711600	to law enforcement? I think he should be an actual detective. You should answer it.
2716160	2721600	I've actually never really given any thought to that. I have had people approach me and say,
2721840	2726880	hey, did you ever think that you could contribute to law enforcement? I'm not so sure that
2727600	2730080	a lot of what I do is very grounded, but I think it is.
2734480	2738960	It wouldn't hold up in a courtroom necessarily. But then again, like profilers and people that,
2738960	2742400	like you might be the person that they go to and just go like, Ryan, what do you think about this
2742400	2749040	guy? He sounds like a classic number 17. Yeah, I definitely think I'll be beneficial in that way
2749040	2755280	for sure. Yeah, that'd be great. You would consider yourself like the equivalent of like
2755280	2763760	a psychic in the sense that if it works, it works. Well, there's crime shows about a guy
2763760	2768080	who's like, his eyebrows twitching. You know what that means. He's thinking about his mom.
2768080	2771920	And it's like, that's not going to hold up in court. But in the TV show, it works fucking great
2771920	2775440	because that makes the guy confess, and then that does work. Well, if it helps you knock on the
2775440	2780720	right door, and then that guy tries to crawl out the window, you got it. It's like, oh, how
2780720	2785200	would you knock on my door? A profiler told us. What the fuck's a profiler? Yeah, that shit
2785200	2790720	doesn't hold up in court. And sometimes that's a psychic. You hear law enforcement sometimes say,
2792400	2797360	they have this weird relationship with psychics that call in because they're kind of going,
2797360	2803280	and I've heard you say this on your podcast, where what I'm hearing you say is something
2803280	2810000	that agent Dale Cooper and Twin Peaks would say, which is, to make you sound more legitimate,
2810000	2817200	by the way, if the linear path isn't working, figure out any other way to look at this.
2817200	2821920	And so sometimes you'll go, so I'm looking at this whole thing from the perspective of
2821920	2826880	John Hughes movies. And it's like, well, wait, that's not, but then you're like,
2826880	2831360	now looking at that from that perspective, you discover different details, or you notice
2831360	2835440	different connections, and then you draw different conclusions, which more often than not,
2836240	2843680	solve the crime. It's a good podcast. Speaking of movies, it's like an old Western,
2843680	2850640	like you'd be a great country judge, like, well, I know the law says this, and the law says that,
2850640	2857680	but this guy's clearly from, I don't know if you've ever seen Sixteen Candles, but
2862160	2869360	do you, just talk about that for a second, because you've addressed that a couple times in your
2869360	2877440	podcast. It's sort of like, you're a hero to me, because you kind of like, every once in a while,
2877440	2883040	I'm like, wait, this guy believes in voodoo. And then the other sentence, you're like,
2883040	2892560	oh, no, you're such a logician, and you're bridging some gap there, where you believe
2892560	2897440	that it's all about perspective or something. Yeah, I mean, I think there's part of my show
2897440	2902400	that I guess I should probably clarify. I've always been very polarizing. And obviously,
2902400	2910960	you know that a lot of people hate my show. So it's always been about logic and about trolling
2910960	2915920	people as well, because I have a lot of hate listeners. Do you actively troll people?
2917040	2920880	I think my show is an active troll. But you don't do it on purpose, though.
2923040	2925840	I'm only doing this because my haters are going to hate it.
2926480	2930720	No, no, absolutely not. No, I mean, just the general nature of the show and how I put it together.
2930720	2935520	What is the average? The things that, like, if I'm trolling the people who hate the show,
2935520	2938160	that's usually to the benefit of the people who like it. Yeah.
2938160	2942960	What is your average troll beefing about with your show that it's to not logic based or?
2942960	2950480	Oh, it's like it's anything from the production to the audacity of my conclusions to the what my
2950480	2955120	voice to the way I present things to the cadence. But that's great, because you're doing basically
2955120	2961840	more of your you're doing an opinion piece like you're putting your lending your own, you know,
2961840	2968960	like subjective ideas on the things. And like the people that like edit like opinion editorial
2968960	2973120	pages and newspapers, they love the hate mail. That means people are reading and that means
2973120	2976800	we're creating a conversation. So that's good. Yeah, I mean, that's definitely part of what I
2976800	2981760	do. You know, a lot of true crime shows you listen to, regardless of whether they're good or bad,
2981760	2985920	you know, there's there's kind of a thing where people are not quite committing to
2985920	2990000	certain conclusion in a case for whatever reason. I mean, it might not be what the show is about.
2990000	2993520	But I tend to just be audacious and go for it and just say what I think.
2993520	2997440	I think it's an interesting intersection between true crime and podcasting is that the part of you
2997440	3002960	that wants to podcast is the part of you that wants somebody out there to like you. Otherwise,
3002960	3007200	why podcast it? But the part of you that likes true crime is the part of you that
3007200	3015120	wants to acknowledge that life is disgusting and toxic and predatory. And so it's tough. I've
3015120	3020960	talked to the red handed gals about this, how it's like I like them because they're they don't
3020960	3025760	they don't constantly pause. And I understand the constant pauses with true crime podcasters where
3025760	3030240	they're like, by the way, this is about the victim and not about the oh, no one wants to hear about
3030240	3034080	what Jack the Ripper did. He's not a hero or anything. But anyways, this episode is called
3034080	3038080	Jack the Ripper. And it's really about the victims. And it's like,
3038080	3049120	the I like that you're I mean, we need people that are that you're you clearly like hear the
3049120	3055520	haters. And then you're like, all right, that's expected. But here's the thing. I'm a genius.
3055520	3059600	Like I don't, of course you'd hate that. I'm gonna blow your fucking mind.
3061600	3064000	Is it ever guessed? Or is it just you just straight to mic?
3064000	3069040	Oh, it's just me. I mean, it would be funny to hear a guest. Yeah, I mean,
3069040	3073680	can I be for the first guest? I because because I would be like, oh, shit, the air conditioner
3073680	3078000	went on again. I sit there with Cody. I'm like, God damn it. The air conditioner went on.
3078000	3079600	Who wants to see down on the show? I mean,
3081360	3086080	it's his audience. Don't let me ruin your show, though. Like, I don't set the sociopath.
3088720	3092960	Like an ooze trying to get in and destroy. I don't want it. I don't want to ruin things.
3092960	3097280	I debated on the show is like I don't because I really that's how much affection I have for
3097280	3101760	your show and there for you is like we talked about that. I was like, I don't want to keep
3101760	3107120	doing this thing. Like, I don't want to keep jabbing my ruler into primordial ooze. I love
3107120	3113200	true crime podcasting because it's punk rock. I think it's fucked up that I'm kind of getting
3113200	3120240	tired of like laying in bed with Cody and then the neck and it's like, Oh, in other news,
3120880	3124880	I guess I'm going on harm in town and I'm kind of like, Am I fucking up? Am I fucking up? Or
3124880	3130400	am I signal boosting? I want a signal boost. I don't want to fuck up. You're not here for me.
3130400	3134560	Let's talk about you. Okay. Can I ask a question? Because I'm fascinated about like we, we talked
3134560	3139520	briefly that you left corporate. Can we ask what the corporate gig was? What were you doing before?
3139520	3147600	He founded Tesla. Whoa. I was an executive assistant to the CIO of my company. Yeah.
3147600	3151200	That's all I was doing. I just, I needed a corporate job that had a decent paycheck.
3151200	3155120	And what kind of a like job was it? Like what the tech or something like that?
3155120	3159200	Oh yeah. It was in an it department for a real commercial real estate company.
3159200	3162720	And then you started podcasting about true crime. Was it your first, first podcast?
3162720	3168240	Was it your first? I mean, I just been writing for a long time and it wasn't really paying off
3168240	3172560	as well as I'd liked. And I just figured I just needed a way to distribute my work so that I could
3172560	3176400	get it in front of a lot of people. And podcasting was just the natural way to go. I mean, there are
3176400	3182160	other factors involved. And it went so well that you could say goodbye to your Santa Monica
3182160	3188480	West side corporate job that paid probably pretty well. And then you can just go fuck it. I'm
3188480	3192560	leaving to Arizona and I'm just going to make people on the internet mad about murders.
3192560	3196400	Yeah, pretty much. That's the way it went. Yeah. I mean, I was just,
3196400	3200080	do you really just followed your own weird joy on that one? I just said like, this is what I want to
3200080	3203680	do. Oh, totally. Yeah. I mean, I just worked nonstop and it was like, I got to a point where
3203680	3207440	I was exhausted and I was like, it has to be one thing or the other. And I wanted it to be
3207440	3214640	the creative side. So that's so cool. That's just inspirationally awesome. Yeah. I mean,
3214640	3219280	that's hats off to that. I mean, yeah. And like everyone listening to that, like that's like,
3219280	3224560	like just do the thing that you're obsessed about. That's the break your dehumanizing internet
3224560	3230000	is that it should be providing. Yeah. Like that's what I love about it. As I said to what's his
3230000	3237440	fucking last episode, what's his doctor? What's his, what's his guy overheard LA. I'm like, I love,
3237440	3243520	I love the, like the internet, like for all of its stories about how it destroys people with its
3243520	3251520	fucking acidic demonization. It's also like, yeah, but before it existed, you couldn't just go,
3253200	3257200	tell me one more time to reload this paper tray. You piece of shit.
3258160	3263680	I'm going to go home, grab a Yeti mic from Best Buy. That's what mic I have too.
3266320	3270240	I can't figure out how to make those things work. They're a lot better than these ones. I mean,
3270240	3274160	they're not better, but they have a, you could talk a lot farther away. You can just like,
3274160	3279120	and it's not about like, oh, you're either Mozart or you don't know how to play piano. I don't like,
3279120	3283680	I like the death of that hierarchy and the birth of that circular system where it's like,
3283680	3293040	actually you don't know who, like maybe the reason I was born is because I'm neither like,
3293040	3298720	I'm just me. I love that, that people go like, yeah, she's just her. And then they like that,
3298720	3303120	then we, then we praise these stories or go, she was just her. No, she's a billionaire. And then
3303120	3309440	we ruin that person. But I like the, like that idea of like that ever widening marketplace where
3309440	3316800	it's like, you can just be you. And, and then we, you know, well, YouTube, we all need someone
3316800	3322160	while we're just being us to, I don't know, drill the oil and stuff. But we'll go on to other
3322160	3325600	countries for that. When podcasting first came around, like I was, you know, I'm the old funny
3325600	3330320	that it was like, what's a blog? It was a combination of two words. It's stupid. And what's a podcast?
3331120	3337200	And, and of course I've been doing a podcast for a thousand years. And, but like, there is,
3337200	3342240	there is kind of a little art movement to it where people just like, that there's just,
3342240	3345600	there's little pockets of humanity. It could be anywhere in the world. It doesn't have to be
3345600	3350400	in New York or, you know, Hollywood and just sit down and just talk about stuff and people fall
3350400	3356480	in love with it. And that's, that's, that's closer to like, like 60s and 70s punk rock, New York,
3356480	3360640	like, like people just going, I'm not a great guitar player. I just know I want to go into
3360640	3365760	these shitty little clubs and just scream into a microphone. Now, I don't want to be this guy.
3368000	3369760	But if you did, if it go a little something
3370720	3376480	said the guy who didn't want to be that guy. Never on steroids.
3379360	3386080	But we should, I really want to, here's what I want to do. I want to send Ryan out of the room,
3386800	3392320	stage a murder. Okay. Why stage it? Well, not stage a murder, but like,
3393120	3399440	but like have a truth that we know and that you don't know. Have you come back
3400080	3406880	and just like, I don't know, kind of have you examine it. Right. It's not to test you. It's
3406880	3411840	just to like, this sounds totally legit. How about this? I'll take Ryan into the green room. We'll
3411840	3417040	cover our ears and then have like leave you or somebody come get us. But I'll be like your,
3417040	3421600	wait, but you, you want me in on the job. Yeah. Have someone else cover his ears.
3423040	3430320	We did build that. In my mind, I would be like the shitty local detective who brought in the
3430320	3437200	fancy podcast profiler. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm using just my regular cop training,
3437200	3440400	but he's got the super power. All right. But then what Spencer and I left doing,
3440400	3445520	like one of us murders the other and I just want to figure out like, well, what we can,
3445520	3451280	we have the hardest part is fine. Well, all we need to do is decide on something conversationally
3451920	3458000	and decide on what like, like, well, you decide like, um, uh, what, what, what happened. And then
3458000	3464080	we decide who did it. That's all very difficult. It is hard. Yeah. Okay. We could do it though.
3464080	3468320	But we can do it, but then once we know the truth, then definitively we'll be lying. Well,
3468320	3471280	how about, is anybody in our audience? Uh, has anyone actually committed a murder that has
3471280	3477200	been told? Yeah, please tell me. Wait, wait, we can figure this out. We can figure this out.
3477280	3481920	Do you want to? Yeah. Uh, yeah. Using someone from the audience is a good idea.
3481920	3485920	I like that start, but like we can't murder people.
3486880	3490800	Well, let's not rule that out just yet. We need our options on the table.
3493680	3495120	You don't have any suggestions. We don't know that.
3496160	3499600	Like how does redirection of late work backwards where you could be like, you know what would
3499600	3504480	make you, what about this? Does anybody, cause when you, when you watch these, uh, you know,
3504480	3507920	these murder shows and or listen to the true crime podcast kind of things,
3508480	3512880	do you ever kind of fantasize? Like, I think I have the perfect crime or if I wanted to
3512880	3517360	like do somebody, this is how I think I would get away with it. If anybody, does anybody have one?
3517360	3522160	No. Cause I've got like five. Yeah, but that's, if you have a good one,
3522160	3528240	you never want to share it out loud, especially on a recording. That's like rule number one of my
3528240	3532320	plan. Yeah. But this would be a great way. This would be a great way to expiate that and go like,
3532320	3536240	I could never do that now because I've said it on, on one of the world's most famous podcasts.
3536240	3540800	I feel like basically what we could do is an improvement on our 9-1-1 call thing. But the
3540800	3546560	thing that we did wrong last time is the ladies were in the room and then we pretend like if we
3546560	3554400	send you guys out of the room and then Spencer and I, uh, we decide on a scenario and then we,
3554400	3559680	we bring you guys back in and we make our 9-1-1 calls based on what we know is the truth.
3560640	3563440	Yeah. Yeah. I like that. I think I'm close there. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.
3564400	3569200	Do you want to actually say, Jeff just wants to leave. No, no. Yes. I got to go back and do a
3569200	3575840	little, uh, but I think honestly, I think you can stay for this version. Okay. He doesn't need his
3575840	3580640	ears. I was just saying that like, like I'm the shitty cop. I'm the local, you know, knuckle head
3580640	3586480	detective from Colorado Springs. Give him a choice of three 9-1-1 calls. If he covers his ears,
3586480	3591680	leaves the room and then comes back in and we've decided on what really happened because
3591680	3596000	then we'll have a truth in our head. And then we make a 9-1-1 call. We're all making 9-1-1 calls.
3596000	3600000	Yeah. Oh, right. We're all covering up the same crime. Yep. I got you. That's what we did wrong
3600000	3604880	last time. I have no idea as we were making up. That's for the best. You know, Steve Levy is a
3604880	3608960	wonderful conversationalist. He'll take you in the alley. He'll chat you up. It'll be grand.
3608960	3611280	Steve Levy. Could you come out here, please? Leave me to the stage.
3611280	3614320	Oh, what are you saying? I have to get murdered. What's that? Am I getting set up to get murdered
3614320	3619440	here? It'd be the perfect crime because we'd be like, I don't know what happened to him. We
3619440	3624240	were talking about murder and then he never came back. By the way, back alley code seven.
3626400	3632560	What if this is the perfect crime? We wouldn't be recording it. No, we would be because we'd be
3632560	3636880	recording it and it sounds so guileless. Even what I'm doing right now, which is getting like meta
3636880	3639760	and like laying layers on to it. I don't know. This is a couple of guiles to me. This is where
3639760	3645280	we find out, by the way, that Steve during the show has been murdered. Well, no, this is when
3645280	3651040	he lives his real life. He goes to Newark and like does coke and shit. I think he fights crime
3651040	3657120	or he's out there murdering people. Yeah. He's like night wing. He's never. He comes out to
3657120	3662000	bring the vodka out. Nobody asked to create an alibi. It's an alibi. Meanwhile, then he goes
3662000	3668080	and fucking does a show with Bette Midler. Yes. He's the MacArthur park hand jobber.
3668160	3673760	Are you comfortable with this? He's the MacArthur park hand jobber. The least sought after a
3673760	3684000	criminal. No one wants him caught or her. That is my next episode. People say victimless crime,
3684000	3689840	but he's, it's just, it's too vigorous. It's kind of like fucking at least, you know,
3690000	3701520	the MacArthur park hand jobber, uh, uh, criminal or Samaritan tonight at 11, uh, like they, uh,
3701520	3707120	and I said, did you just have like college kids going like a guy came out or a lady? I don't know.
3707120	3711120	They had like a satin glove on. They said, do you want a hand job? I said, no, they left.
3712960	3717840	I was in MacArthur park. I like the ducks. Okay. So I just have one people are asking,
3717840	3720960	are they a criminal? And it's like, and then someone else is like, I said, yes,
3720960	3725440	best hand job of my life. I know it can figure out. Should we catch this person
3726560	3733520	or should we all be them? I just, uh, so I think should, well, are we all covering up the crime
3733520	3737680	or is one of us covering up the crime and the other two are, are being honest? I think somebody
3737680	3742480	should go, Oh, like my loved one was attacked. I mean, well, we'll all say that. Yeah, that could be
3742480	3747760	the murder. I think what we need to do is don't leave yet. So let's figure this out. So the idea
3747920	3753840	is we would send Ryan out and then we would decide while he's out on a, uh, on the specifics
3753840	3758000	of a crime. I guess this is where it all falls apart. No, no, that, that part, I guess it's already
3758000	3763040	falling apart. Well, that's to be sure. And then he would call me in and we would basically like,
3763040	3768720	do our 911 calls. Right. I don't know. But are we all doing, are we all guilty? Cause then he'd just
3768720	3773920	say, yeah, you're all guilty or it was one of us guilty. I'd say, I'd say, Oh no, no, only one of
3773920	3777760	us is guilty. Right. Okay. If it's one or two people are guilty, it could be only one person or
3777760	3781200	it could be two people. It has to be one person. And then we see if he can pick the guilty person.
3781200	3784400	You should pick an actual victim here and just have somebody leave the room. Right.
3784400	3790480	Not trying to figure out who it is. The audience member has to leave. They can't see the rest of
3790480	3795520	the show. Okay. Just, uh, no, just for a minute. How about this? How about this? The four of us
3795520	3801120	stay here and the whole audience leaves. You give me an hour. We could do just that. Can we try? I
3801120	3805440	feel like the audience would be frustrated if we don't just try it. Yeah. Just right. Okay. Ryan,
3805440	3812800	get out of here. We're going to try it. Thanks so much. Steve doesn't exist. Go back stage and plug
3812800	3817280	your ears and we'll call you. Yeah. Unplug your ears. On our, on our system, Ryan, you plug your
3817280	3821680	ears and say, blah, blah, blah. Even if this doesn't work, it's just another turn down the monitor.
3821680	3826080	All right. The one in the back, not these ones. It doesn't exist. Or he would have come up here by
3826080	3834080	now. I'm going to check in the back. Steve loves smoking. So how this would work is we would,
3834080	3840000	we would decide on a crime that happened, right? So there's a dead baby, a dead baby in a bucket.
3840000	3847360	Okay. Can it be a four year old? I demand it. Sorry. Sorry. It has to be a four year old. Okay.
3847360	3854160	Great. So it's a dead four year old in a bucket by a river. Right. And either we found it or we
3854160	3859440	killed it. Right. Is it working, Jeff? Talk a little lower. Okay. All right. All right. Let's just,
3860320	3865360	we could, what? That's fair. You know, we're going to, it's going to have to be a.
3865360	3869200	Just don't eat the mic. Okay. All right. So we were talking about, it's a dead baby.
3871600	3875280	And so it's not likely either we found it or we, or we're the reason it's there.
3876480	3880480	No, it's too quiet. I couldn't hear what you said. When you, when you, when you, when you kill
3880480	3887280	a person, usually like you either found it, it's kind of whoever smelt it, dealt it. Like you
3887280	3893440	read the person that fan finds the body. All right. So who's going to be guilty? Uh, okay.
3893440	3899200	Don't say it on the mic. Just let's raise hands. Okay. Uh, well we need to pick someone from the
3899200	3903440	audience come up and pick. Okay. You raised your hand. You want to come up and pick whoever's going
3903440	3909440	to be the murderer. Right. Come on up. Okay. So that's a, it's not an audible process.
3910560	3914480	All right. And, uh, if you have anything to plug, we'll also a sound cloud or anything.
3915920	3919840	You deserve, you deserve something. Okay. So you're going to pick
3919840	3923520	the person that's the murderer and we're not going to acknowledge it audibly.
3923520	3929280	Right. So it's, uh, they're, they're in the bucket and it's okay that the audience knows.
3929280	3933680	We just want to make sure that our Asperger detective. So the, uh,
3933680	3939840	our show feels so classy. Thank you.
3940720	3945920	But he was like, wait, wait, don't tell me like this really polite applause.
3946720	3951600	One of us, someone in this room is a murderer. We have to do more. What's the crime? What's the
3951600	3958640	crime? The crime is there's a baby in a bucket. Right. It's four years old. It was, it's in a,
3958640	3963520	it's been killed and placed in a bucket. Fuck. This isn't going to work.
3963520	3969840	No, it'll work. It'll work. What? Well, we're going to be interrogated. Uh, well, no, we're
3969840	3975120	calling, well, my theory is we're calling 911, right? Like we're each calling 911 or is that not,
3975120	3984320	no, that works. We each found a baby in a bucket. Two of us are, are, are the people that founded
3984320	3988800	the baby in the bucket. One of us is the person that killed the baby in the bucket. Okay.
3989440	3993520	So why would, why would that person call 911? Because of smokescreen. Okay. Right. Because
3993520	3997440	otherwise they just leave the baby to be found. Okay. Let's just, let's just keep it simple.
3997440	4000960	Let's just try a couple more facts. Do you want a couple more facts? All right. There's a baby,
4000960	4004960	there's a baby in a bucket. One of us did it. And we're all going to call up for various reasons
4004960	4009760	and say, uh, oh Jesus Christ, baby in a bucket. Yeah. I mean, I know, I already know this isn't
4009760	4014960	going to work. No, it'll work enough. But here's the thing. Okay. The way that, the way that he's
4014960	4020400	going to be helpful in this and we're going to show off Ryan's skillset is that he's going to
4020400	4025520	ask us details, but we're all going to be making them up. That's why it doesn't work. That's why
4025520	4030640	it doesn't work. Well, no, I mean, I think, I think it'll be good. Right. They're just, we need,
4030640	4035520	let's just say like two kinds of facts that are clues that, that we could kind of all, all be
4035520	4040960	consistent on a redirection of light point. That's the thing is we want him to detect where the
4040960	4046160	redirection of light happened. So like we actually need to actually like, we need to know that you
4046160	4051200	guys, I don't know. No, just a couple. Okay. So he's in a bucket. It was by the river. He was
4051200	4057040	playing, right? Those are things we we've learned. So just establish two more facts. The baby was
4057040	4063200	wealthy. Right. Okay. Great. He was an heir to the, the, the, the kingdom of. Okay. Okay. I got,
4063200	4066400	I think I understand this and he, I hope he's not listening. I hope he's not listening, but I,
4066400	4072640	cause I need to explain this like loudly and like, basically we're all the same person. Right.
4072640	4079760	If that makes sense. Yeah. And so, but like, uh, there are two versions of us are innocent. Right.
4079760	4084880	And one version of us is guilty. So what we need to decide on is what actually happened.
4084880	4090080	Okay. That's what I was saying. Oh yeah. No, no, sorry. I'm not trying to. Well, I don't listen to
4090080	4099360	other people. But okay. All right. I'm glad you were saying that then. Okay. All right. So let's,
4099360	4105280	let's agree on some details. Only the murder timeline. Why, how did the baby end up in the,
4105280	4110640	if the baby ended up in the bucket and we didn't kill it here. Okay. Let's agree on what happened.
4110640	4117520	Right. Or, or did, or, or did the two people that didn't kill the baby leave the room too.
4117520	4121520	And only the person that killed the baby knows the actual story. So no one actually knows what
4121520	4126880	happened. That's too complicated. No, no, that's great. Oh, that is good. So who killed, I don't,
4126880	4130480	who killed again, we're all going to leave the room at one point. Okay. So what if,
4130480	4135200	what if the coloring book was still in the car? Wait, we're just, these are just clues.
4136160	4140640	Aren't we supposed to leave? Who, who, wait, I thought, did you, these are clues. These are,
4140640	4144320	right. Let's say that's for instance, but that's not going to be the one that we do.
4144320	4150640	Okay. Can you come back up and point again? How about, how about this? Church, give Spencer.
4154800	4158960	What? Come up and give Spencer some clues, but Dan and I won't plug.
4161120	4165760	And give dance. All right. Okay. Who wants to come up and give, give Spencer some clues.
4165760	4169280	Wait, why do you give clues? It's not, I know. There's going to be details.
4170160	4173920	There needs to be one truth for the people that didn't kill the baby. And then the other
4173920	4177680	person needs to be like making it up. Well, let's just, let's just try it. Let's just do
4177680	4182640	alibis now. I think we should stick with a coloring book in the car. Okay. If we want one
4182640	4186960	more coloring book in the car. Yeah. Okay. All right. But we all know that. All right. Yes.
4188000	4193760	Okay. One more is the car. Where was the car parked? How about by the river? Great. By the
4193760	4197680	river. And so we're all going to be calling in separately for, for different reasons. And we're
4197680	4204720	all two of us because we found a baby in a bucket. Okay. And one of us because we killed the baby and
4204720	4209360	put it in a bucket. Right. This doesn't work. Does everyone know, does everyone know who killed the
4209360	4214880	baby? I don't. Well, you guys don't. Yeah. So can you come back up and point at the person again?
4214880	4228320	I, I, okay. All right. All right. So everyone in the audience, he just pointed at Dan, Jeff,
4228320	4234320	and Spencer. All of our reason to be a subscriber to the live feed. You will know right now who
4235120	4240640	this is, I mean, I, I'm not saying we're making a mistake. I just want, I want to get better at this.
4240640	4244640	One thing happened that made everything fall apart and otherwise it was going great.
4244800	4248240	I don't want to reveal what that thing was. Hopefully you make it through your surgery and
4248240	4252080	I want to retune this and like, hopefully I die. I want to do nothing but have true.
4252080	4255040	Then we can call 911 about me dying on an operating day.
4256320	4261520	I don't know what happened. I found his head in a bucket. I guess his surgery. All right.
4261520	4264800	Okay. So what's the, how do we, how do we go ABC through this now?
4265680	4268320	So we want another audience member to pick who should go first then.
4268320	4275360	Yeah. I go first. Someone just said, okay. Uh, did you hear, okay. Did you hear what happened?
4276400	4282720	No, that sounds like a low idea with, he's redirecting light, but I, this son of a bitch.
4282720	4287840	Yeah. How, how much did you hear? Anything at all? Nothing. All right. I'll tell you,
4287840	4292800	Ryan, not a whole lot happened down here. A lot of confusion. Yeah. I was actually, no, no,
4292800	4296960	it was good. A lot of that could have happened with you on stage, but otherwise it was good.
4296960	4302480	So the premise is three of us are, we're all going to give you a 911 call about a murder
4302480	4307680	that has happened. And then you're going to pick who of us is based on your own. You can bring us
4307680	4311440	into, to the, to the questioning room. You can do whatever you want. Your Michael checklists
4311440	4319680	of your own shield. You can do whatever you want out here. All right. Uh, I go first. Uh, uh,
4319680	4332480	911. That's already, I mean, I'm, I'm saying, uh, who's dispatch? I'll be, I'll be, who's
4332480	4337520	dispatch? Oh, well, it's not, we need somebody. You've done it. You, you, you should, you deserve
4337520	4347040	thank you more. You can, can you be dispatch? Great. I just think I just brought a new sugar.
4347040	4353120	This is great. Can you be 911 dispatch? All right. Generally the job entails telling anyone, uh,
4353120	4358960	that has an emergency to calm down. All right. I'm aware. Just hang up on him. Just hang up.
4358960	4369120	All right. So I, I dial 9 1 1. I'm dispatch. Yeah. Yeah. Now you say 9 1 1. When you say
4369120	4376560	what's your emergency? You're the answer. Oh, 911 dispatch. Hi. Uh, my name is, uh, yes.
4377280	4383680	Calm down. Promote it. I need you to calm down.
4383680	4394480	Um, I, uh, uh, my name is, uh, Jake Sweetwater. I live at 1 4 5, uh, Mercury Lane. Okay. Sir,
4394480	4400000	sir. I, I need to figure out what's going on. I, I, I, I, I think I've found the remains of a
4400000	4405360	small child. Uh, it's in the, uh, the Sweetwater river and it's not named after me. Strangely,
4407920	4410880	sir. I mean, my family moved here because we thought it was funny.
4411200	4418160	Sir, you're acting very, very suspicious right now. Okay. I still don't know about what's,
4420480	4424320	the remains. Let's start with the remains. Near my farm by the old, uh, the old well,
4425120	4428800	uh, there is a, there, it would seems to be a painter's bucket, which it looks like the remains,
4429760	4435520	the remains of a small child. And, uh, is this your child or just a child? I don't have a child.
4435520	4442640	Sadly, that should have been one of the. My wife can't conceive and, uh, but this is neither here.
4444160	4451280	I'm just saying that we should get whatever you guys do at 911 incorporated. I should bring down
4453040	4457200	I'm pretty certain these are, these are young baby remains in a painter's bucket.
4458800	4463920	Sir, I need, I need more details. I gave you my address. I told you my name. I'm, I'm, I'm,
4463920	4468560	I'm a single father. When did you find these remains? How long have you? No, just, no,
4468560	4473280	I waited three days to tell you what were you doing? I found the bucket and my wife and I could
4473280	4480480	say, fuck it. Let's go to Cancun and then we'll come back. Look, I, I'm telling you that I found
4480480	4486720	what looks just to be some decomposing remains of a small child. And the end, here's my name and
4486720	4493360	address, sir. I need you to come down. I think your lack of commitment to your job is more
4493360	4501360	criminal than what led to a baby. How long dead? Who am I the coroner? I'm not the medical examiner
4501360	4505680	here to figure out who I need to send. I don't know if I need to send a fire truck. I would send
4505680	4511760	police. I would, I would send a medical team, sir. Yes. Calm down, please. Okay. Don't, don't,
4511760	4520880	don't gender specify me. Whoa. That's the cops. We have, we will have someone out on the way.
4520960	4524240	Wouldn't that be nice? I got a baby in a bucket over here. We heard somebody.
4525600	4529600	Don't move the bucket. Okay. I'm not touching the bucket. I'm just, I'm just letting you know.
4529600	4535520	You don't touch the bucket with the baby. Hey man, I watch a lot of TV. If you see a baby in a
4535520	4539120	bucket, what am I going to do? I'm touch the bucket? No, then I'm the guy that put the baby in the
4539120	4543040	bucket. There's a lot of things you can do with the baby. I don't know. I think, I think you're
4543040	4547040	overstepping your fucking bailiwick right now. You should just get the police down there. Ma'am,
4547040	4558160	drop the bucket. I'm not a, I'm not a man. It says you drop the bucket. I'm not, I'm not holding
4558160	4572480	the bucket. Open fire, open fire. Hello, Natalie, Natalie. Yes. Can you find the main frame where
4572480	4577280	everything's recorded and delete most of it? Give me a few minutes. No, I went too far. I went
4577280	4583200	too far. Don't affect the cannon. Okay. So that was, that was my 911 call to dispatch. I think
4583200	4588960	next time we do this game. All right. It's not a, uh, it's not a good game. You matter my hair.
4588960	4594720	Who goes second? I think next time we might actually nail it. Spencer. That's one. Let's
4594720	4599040	keep the gun out of my mouth. All right. Is that we're making steps. And all these members randomly
4599040	4604720	chosen Spencer to go second at the 911 call. Okay. Now the question is how much,
4604720	4609760	how familiar is Spencer with my 911 call? See, that's what we bugged. That's what we
4609760	4615520	debugged is that we had to establish all, all common facts about the relationship with the baby.
4615520	4623520	Okay. Okay. Beep, boop, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, boop, boop, boop.
4623520	4630720	Sir, sir, please stop pressing buttons. It's three letters. I just pressed 911. There's only
4630720	4635680	three letters. There's only three numbers. Hi, my name's Carl sweetwater. I live on the sweetwater
4635680	4642800	farm next to the sweetwater river. I'm so, I'm so sorry to bother you. I just, I have a situation.
4642800	4647520	I can't believe it. I was just babysitting my, my baby niece, my four year old niece
4647520	4651840	down by the river. We drove down by the river. Sorry. I need you to calm down. Okay. I need
4652720	4655840	did you happen to have a bucket with you? How did you know?
4658720	4666160	Um, let me, let me do some breathing exercise. Okay. So we were playing with sand in the bucket.
4666160	4670400	Okay. And, uh, I went back to my car because they left their coloring book in the car.
4670400	4676000	Okay. She did not they. And, um, and so when I, when I came back with the coloring book,
4676000	4681360	I just see the kid face down head in the bucket, not breathing. I tried to resuscitate her.
4681360	4688080	It didn't work. I was too late. Sir, sir. Let me ask you this. Are you CPR certified? No. And I,
4688080	4693760	but you know, you just panic. Okay. Do you have any other relatives that you know of that may have
4693760	4700400	been in under the sweetwater name? Oh yeah. Owner of the sweetwater, uh, brand of electronic companies.
4704720	4710320	Why is that real? Can you send someone? It's a slow day. It's only me here.
4710320	4714320	So I've, I've taken a lot of calls in. Oh, I've been there. I've, I've, I've got,
4714320	4720160	I've received a call. Um, you may want to check the river. Well, for what?
4722080	4729200	Oh boy. I think I got a dead kid. I'm so, I just, I don't know. I'm so sorry. I, I can't believe I
4729200	4736160	fucked up. It was just, it was just less than a minute. We will send someone over. Please.
4736160	4745040	Can you ask them to not shoot me? Oh, sweetwater farm has a history. Ma'am, put the bucket down.
4746960	4750480	This bucket in my hands to open fire. Oh no.
4752800	4757200	All right. Put some coke in the sock and call the chief. See that's, that's what you were,
4757200	4760880	when you were telling the story, Jeff, I was like, Oh, well I, well I was going to tell a
4760880	4765600	story about being related to this kid. You're just finding a dead kid that you never knew about. So
4765600	4771120	like that, see for the game, that would have been good to establish. Should I have not like,
4771680	4775680	mentioned any sort of relation? You're doing great. I think, I think, I think where we are
4775680	4780000	right now is just as confusing as most first, first four hours of any investigation. No,
4780000	4784880	it's good. I like it. It's not. And now it's dance through this. All right. So now I like this.
4784880	4790080	Dan, Dan has to call 911. All right. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
4790080	4793280	bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
4793280	4796880	Sorry. I don't mean to blow it off. Could you turn down the chimes in the background? I'm having
4796880	4803520	a hard time hearing you. Oh fuck shit. Hello. 911. Sir, yes. Oh my God. There's a baby in a bucket.
4803520	4807840	Oh, okay. I found a baby in a bucket. Okay. Let me, let me see. It's the only time it's happened
4807840	4811760	to you tonight as far as I'm concerned. Sir, I need you to calm down. My name is,
4811840	4817680	my name is Carl Sweetwater. I, I'm like, I'm on my way from a recording session to
4819280	4829680	my renowned audio company. Sir, I need you to calm down. I need you to calm down. I'm trying,
4829680	4833280	I know you need me to calm down, but the truth is- Is this your, is this your baby?
4834000	4840800	God, no. Why would I have a baby in a bucket? I, sir, or maybe ma'am, I don't know you. Thank you.
4840800	4844320	I'm not familiar or I'm not sure what your pronoun is. That's really cool of you. Thank you.
4844880	4850560	You're welcome. I actually, through, during college, I actually was, I did go through a
4850560	4857920	phase where I, I identified as, as a non-binary. Thank you. Thank you. I just found a baby in a
4857920	4864400	bucket. I'm a man now. I'm a book man. I'm going to fucking cock the size of a Lincoln log and I'm
4864400	4870480	like ready to rock. Like I'm through, I'm through that forest and I don't think that's
4870480	4875840	necessarily, I don't think that makes me a hero. So, sir, judging by that, that last sentence,
4875840	4881120	you identify as a man and this is not your, your child. You're right. No, absolutely not. How did
4881120	4887040	you find it? Not because of, I found it in a bucket. My car broke down. I was, I was, I ran
4887040	4893120	out of radiator cap and I like, it started steaming and I, I hit a tree and I was like,
4893200	4898240	I'm going to breath a fresh air and think about where my life's gone. I, I, I've changed my
4898240	4903120	gender. I've like changed my like field of expertise. I've gone from video to audio. I used
4903120	4910960	to be like a woman that was into like HD and then I became a man that was into like, uh, uh, uh,
4910960	4918000	audio and, uh, and now this is like finding my place. Like I hit this tree. I'm on a bunch of
4918080	4923280	ketamine and I am like, I'm breathing and I see this bucket and I'm like, what's in there?
4924400	4926640	I see something gleaming. I'm like, are those teeth?
4928880	4932400	Turns out, yeah. But I'm like, why are they so?
4933360	4937200	Sir, I'd like to, like to let you know this entire call is being recorded.
4937200	4942320	Oh, fuck. I'm going to prison. That's not because I killed this baby.
4942320	4942720	I still, I still.
4943360	4946320	It's because of my past and I'm going to make, I'm going to make,
4946400	4951200	you're fine. All right. So we have our three 911 calls. Now, do we, do we go,
4951200	4956560	do we all get separately? Oh, put the bucket down.
4957680	4958880	No, no cops showed up.
4960880	4967760	Now, does, does Ryan interview us? Also, I think the murderer, the murderer might be the
4967760	4974960	911 dispatcher because the lack of effort put into helping this baby or solving these calls
4974960	4979440	every day. It just feels like it's just another hat to you. But meanwhile, there's three people
4979440	4983280	that have a baby. It's not, they're all under the sweet water name and everyone's very suspicious.
4983280	4986240	I think a major clue is that sweet waters were named Carl. Thank you.
4987040	4990960	Both of you were Carl sweetwater. We should have established the person
4990960	4994640	and all been the same person. Oh, okay. It's fine.
4994640	4999040	We're, we're workshopping better at it. But in the meantime, do you think you know who killed the baby?
4999040	5008560	No, but, um, well, let's see. Perfect. Um,
5010160	5013920	I bet he's analyzing the psychology and it all seems like people were just making a bunch of
5013920	5021920	shit up. Yeah. Well, well, Jeff lied about, well, you contradicted yourself. You said you had a child
5021920	5030000	and then you said you didn't. I did? Yeah. Oh, I, I, I was, uh, I was, I was in shock.
5032480	5037760	Very suspicious. Do you see a baby in a bucket every day? I'm just, I'm just a gentleman farmer
5037760	5045680	who owns a musical electronics company on an eponymous river. By the way, never,
5045680	5050480	never get on their email list. They will email you forever. Yeah. Hey, it's Dale from sweet water.
5051040	5056720	How's your microphone motherfucker? I love sweet water. I'm sure everyone loves them.
5056720	5060800	They're great. They're the emails. So yeah, I think the next question to what I ask is
5061600	5066240	when you left the child next to the bucket, what was the distance between the bucket and the car?
5067520	5072240	In my head, it was about 30 feet, like down the embankment or up the embankment to the car. Okay.
5073600	5079680	In your head. Yeah. When I was picturing the facts situation. Okay. Um, and how long do you think
5079680	5085680	you were at the car? Less than a minute. I think I said, okay. So was your back turned to the child?
5086240	5092240	Uh, not, no, I, I was turning around to face the child to get into my car and grab the coloring
5092240	5099920	book. I'd imagine. Oh, there's a coloring book. You were turning around to face the child to get
5099920	5104320	in the car. Right. Cause the car was headed towards the river. So I turned around to like
5104320	5112560	enter the car door, you know, I love this. I love seeing the process. Does that make sense? It's
5112560	5118080	like, cause the car's facing the river. So then I, I walk away, I unlock the car and where's the
5118080	5122480	bucket in relation to the car? It would be cars facing the river. Right. So it would be forward
5122480	5129680	and to my left that way like that. So like there, oh God, it feels like a cop is just interviewing me.
5129680	5135600	So you, you walked away from the child toward the car. So essentially you were not looking at
5135600	5141840	the child when, when you walked away. Right. Okay. Hmm. In my head. Okay. What did you,
5141840	5144320	what did you hear when you walked away? Nothing.
5147280	5153440	Gurgling. Kid was playing in the bucket as you walked away. Yeah. It was full of sand.
5153440	5157680	It was full of sand. So what was she doing playing with a bucket of sand next to the river? It sounds
5157760	5161520	like something you would do at the beach. Yeah. Unless the, unless the sand was pulled from the
5161520	5167040	river bed. Yeah, it was like a Sandy kind of riverbank. Yeah. In my head. Okay. And why were
5167040	5175120	you there in the first place? We were playing. You just having a good time. The river. So you
5175120	5180800	were there when it was a baby and a bucket. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. We, I took the niece down to play.
5182960	5186240	Now I would love to interrogate you, but the only thing I heard is you had a
5186960	5193200	huge cock. I think. Yeah, no, I, well, the size of Lincoln locks. I think I was scared as soon as you
5193200	5200960	said Lincoln locks are huge when you're a little child. I don't know the long ones. I think you're
5200960	5205840	thinking they're a lot bigger than they are. There's three major sides of Lincoln. They can
5205840	5210720	get pretty big. Yeah. I don't know. Did they still make Lincoln? All right. But then they're
5210720	5214240	plastic. Now they used to be wood. You got a splinter up your fucking. Oh yeah. All right.
5214240	5220320	Final answer. Let's wrap this up. Who did it? Oh, final answer. I have to guess here. I guess.
5222000	5227040	Might be the 911 operator. He actually did say, he did say it's been a slow day. I've had a lot of
5227040	5233360	calls. So yeah, it was all because we're actually the 911 establishing alibi, right? He might have
5233360	5243120	murdered the 911 operator and now he's just holding the freak up. It's good. Happy. Um, let's see. So
5244800	5251120	hmm. It wasn't Gregory because he, it was between the suffering, some sort of emotional trauma from
5251680	5258640	relationship in me or okay. You're looking right at your soulful eyes. You're looking right at me.
5258640	5265680	I'm just like, Oh shit for the list. I didn't expect this about the fact that my family,
5265680	5269440	but my wife and I can't conceive a child. Yeah. So was there something else to that as well?
5270240	5276320	Uh, what do you mean? Just as far as the issues you might, am I under, am I being detained right
5276320	5284320	now? Do you want to be? Oh, I like where this is. I have no car through park and job. No, I mean,
5284320	5290640	no, I'm happy to cooperate with law enforcement all the way on this. I'm just a person that found
5290640	5297920	a dead child in a bucket. How much are you willing to cooperate? Why are we on conference
5297920	5306960	call with 911? You never hung up. Yeah. You just got shot. What was your question? Yeah. My last
5306960	5311520	question would be, what were you doing in that location? I again, do you live nearby? I live
5311520	5315600	nearby. I think you said the bucket was near a well. Yeah. It's the old well and sweet water
5315600	5322080	river. Okay. Yes. Not related. Are you going to the well to get a bucket of water? My wife
5322080	5327360	doesn't like when I smoke in the house. So I take walks up and down the river and, uh, and I just
5327360	5331840	take just a general walk. You ask any of our neighbors, they'll see me kind of patrolling
5331840	5336080	that part of the river just to have my kids kind of clear my head and have a cigarette or two.
5336800	5341920	And, uh, and yes, uh, yeah. Uh, do I smoke a little CBD? Yes. I fucking,
5341920	5352960	I have sleep apnea, bro. And that's Mr. Sweetwater right out, bro. That's pretty,
5352960	5360960	that's pretty rad. Thank you. 911. So yeah. And did I come across a bucket? Yes. Did I call 911
5360960	5366560	to alert the, uh, the authorities should buckets have babies in them? No. Yes. Is that my fault?
5366560	5372400	And is that some shit that I should be suing for it? If I run across it when I'm high. Uh-huh.
5374800	5379120	Okay. So what we're actually missing here is the identity of the baby. Oh,
5379120	5384320	and so that for the setup, that actually requires me. It's Gus Johnson. And
5386960	5394480	where does Gus live in relation to shorewood? Where's the river next town over next town over.
5394960	5400960	No relation to the sweetwaters? No, no, no, no. Random baby. Okay. Yeah. He's all the family
5400960	5406960	called in, but random in the place where it's like sweetwater dense. So he died twice. He died once
5408240	5414800	over here by we all die a million times. I mean, we, uh, we shouldn't birth just kind of death,
5415440	5421680	but reverse his name is Gus Johnson. He's from shorewood. He, he's a decent sense. I mean,
5421680	5427520	we should, we gotta get out of this so that we can like, well, if you have any last questions
5427520	5432800	for Dan, but otherwise, yeah, probably, but I did like the, like seeing the process right there,
5432800	5436720	that those questions are only going to result in bad improv. It's not really going to like lead you
5436720	5440880	to a new answer. If there was a relationship of any kind. No, but it was revealing to watch the
5440880	5446960	way his mind works about what kind of questions he asked. He deserves better. I will say that.
5447520	5452320	He does. Oh, I like to watch his mind work. I wish he was on a better podcast.
5453280	5456160	Like, I wish, would you be happier if we actually killed somebody and had
5456160	5458720	made you have to figure it out. That would be amazing. Yes. Right.
5459520	5464640	How much of a part of, uh, before you make your decision, like when you're leaving your
5464640	5470160	corporate gig to become a, uh, a podcaster about true crime, are you sublimating your own kind of
5470160	5475280	secret fantasies about either being on either side of that? Like it'd be law enforcement side or
5475280	5481040	being on the criminal side. How much of our addiction to true crime stuff is our own
5481680	5488000	kind of secret sublimated fantasies about murder? Oh, I think it plays a great part, especially in
5488000	5492880	the male mind. That's for sure. Um, you know, yeah, I mean, I think everybody has that potential for
5492880	5497200	darkness. A lot of times you just hear about these people who suddenly snap. I mean, obviously
5497200	5501280	they're having issues prior to that, but I mean, when you hear about someone who's living a normal
5501280	5505360	everyday life and then suddenly they just go off the deep end in one moment and just kill a bunch
5505360	5510480	of people. Um, yeah, it's definitely difficult to reconcile that against what we see in everyday
5510480	5516240	life. I mean, I think we talked about this before, but like women love true crime because they, they
5516240	5520480	all, they, they, they are, they're the ones that are going to get murdered. Like women have to worry
5520480	5528400	about men killing them. And so like, uh, like someone said, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. I'm glad
5528480	5533280	I'm here to tell you. I was like, well, he's not, don't kill the messenger. The messenger's one of
5533280	5538080	many people that might kill you. I it's and yet the MacArthur park hand you have a runs free.
5540800	5545760	It would, it would be, it would be the height of political incorrectness to say anything otherwise.
5547680	5553040	Now women don't get killed any more than men. Is there, is there one where you're like, what the,
5553040	5559360	what the fuck are there? I've gotten a, I don't have a B and I have a murdered body. How the fuck
5559360	5564080	do I, I just don't understand how, how this all links together. Um, you know, I think with
5564080	5568880	murders, it's not generally not like that too often, but definitely with disappearances.
5568880	5571920	Like I was the one we were talking about the other night with Brian Shafer. I'm sure everybody
5571920	5576400	knows that case. Well, not necessarily. I mean, these names kind of like, they sound like nothing,
5576400	5579600	but then I guess you noticed when you said, you said a name before, and then you said
5580480	5582960	the girl that texted her boyfriend until he killed herself and was like,
5584880	5589600	Brian Shafer is the guy that went to the bar. That was like the big tuna,
5589600	5595280	Lutuna Saluna, whatever. Like he's like a guy who got out of medical school. He went up an escalator
5595280	5599680	into a bar. He was getting, he was like finishing medical school. He was going to go on a vacation
5599680	5606800	with his girlfriend. He completely fucking disappeared from a weird strip mall bar in
5606880	5614640	the middle of Columbus, Ohio. Um, uh, he never, like there's security camera footage of him going up
5614640	5620720	the escalator to this bar where, and then he goes in and then the security camera footage of like
5620720	5626320	matching the timeline. And then at some point he just, he just disappears. And it's not a murder.
5626320	5630880	It's nothing. It just disappeared. Yeah. No altercation. No body. He was engaged to be
5630880	5639920	married. There was no strife. There was nothing like his, his poor fiance. Like it's you, you, you
5639920	5644800	avoid identifying with her because you're like, I can't live in that nightmare. It's like he, the
5644800	5649920	guy just vanished anyways. But we were, we were talking about that. Like people obsess about that
5649920	5654560	because it's, have you done that episode? Yeah, I did cover that one actually. Oh cool. Yeah. I mean,
5654560	5658320	I think that's one of the ones or one of the very few episodes where I don't really have a
5658320	5662720	definitive answer as to what happened to him. And it's really mysterious. You don't see him leave
5662720	5668400	the building. You don't have a motive for why he left a different way than he came in. Um,
5668400	5673040	like there's no evidence that he died there. So I kind of think that what that one is, is like,
5673040	5681600	it's a rare, uh, uh, we talked about this where we're like, if you can get him out of that bar
5681600	5686800	without a camera, seeing him, which is the actual height of the mystery for people. That's why Reddit
5686800	5692800	is obsessed with this case is because they love to watch security camera footage and love to like,
5692800	5700080	like look at Google earth footage of the, I mean, I was doing, I'm listening to the, uh, true crime
5700080	5705600	garage. Uh, those guys are from Ohio. So I'm like, and they're like talking about this place. I'm like
5705600	5713200	on Google earth looking at the strip mall in 3d going like, where did he go? But if you think about
5713200	5719360	this building tonight as like, Oh, if one of you disappeared tonight and one of you will,
5721360	5725920	they're not find you conceivably, like it could become a famous thing. It's like one of you
5725920	5731680	disappears. And it's like, kind of like if a camera picked up all of you entering and like,
5731680	5737920	it was like one of you disappeared, like the headline of it would become, there were cameras
5737920	5743440	everywhere. They, we know everyone that went in and we don't know where they went. It's like,
5743440	5747280	man, there's a couple of ways to get out of this building without a camera picking up on you.
5747280	5752480	Oh yeah, sure. And it's not, it is weird. It would be weird if one of you got out of this
5752480	5759120	building without a camera, seeing you sad or uplifting you pick, but it would be weird if
5759120	5764080	one of you could get out of here without a camera knowing where you went. But if you just take a
5764080	5770960	flyer on that weirdness and then add to that the crazy, like, kind of like random, horrible death
5770960	5777520	of like, he was looking for Coke, like you and I kind of over dinner decided. Oh, definitely. Yeah.
5777520	5782800	I mean, I've been that guy. I was, I was like, in my, I remember being in my twenties and wandering
5782800	5789600	around the Cheetah club and like going like, is anybody know? Coke. And I'm like, I, I like wake
5789600	5797520	up the next morning. I'm like, I'm so lucky to be alive. All right. I shared too much. But I'm kind
5797520	5804400	of like, the next, next murder mystery. But I do think it's like, uh, okay. So like, like, uh,
5804400	5810400	all right, Harmon, nail your showdown. Um, I want to talk, I don't, I do want to talk about actually
5810400	5816240	like, let's talk about the fact that like the, the personal side of you, that sounds corny. The,
5816320	5822880	the, your, you, you, you, you wander into these Springer final thoughts because you're,
5822880	5826960	you're dealing with sociopathic things. You're dealing with the ghoulish thing. And then you,
5826960	5832880	you'll like, so why did she, why did she stab her children to death? I'll tell you why, uh,
5832880	5838400	redirection of light. Uh, but you'll, you'll kind of like, just at the point where you,
5838400	5844160	we, we, we would think you're going to leave us. Like you, you do play the role of like a nice,
5844720	5848640	uh, nurturing uncle or father or something where you're like,
5849520	5855200	and here's the thing. It's okay though. She's in prison now. And here's why she did that.
5855200	5859840	She just wanted to be famous. And why wouldn't you want to want that if you were a sociopath and
5859840	5866160	you didn't have any things. And then you'll, you'll slide into not only these like crazy kind of
5866160	5874400	Bukowski, uh, pros pieces that I, I, like Spencer has Spencer and I have agreed to like,
5874400	5880160	man, you could, you could do like a highlight clip of these. I think Cody who got your app and was
5880160	5887360	like, wait, this motherfucker is doing spoken word. Like I didn't know about that. You actually do
5887360	5891760	like rhyming shit where you're like, but that's that in the cat and the hat. And I don't think
5891760	5898400	you're, you, you get, but, but the more important thing is that you, yeah, you kind of go there
5898400	5904560	just when we're feeling left where our, our attraction to true crime, I think is an attraction
5904560	5910720	to like, we're like, Oh man, is everything die? I don't think, I don't think we're rooting for death
5910720	5915680	when we, when we're attracted to that stuff. I think we're rooting for life when we're attracted
5915760	5922640	to that stuff. And I think that you are responding to that stuff. Talk about how you decide to end
5922640	5931040	your episodes with these weird spoken word riffs or where you go. Like you, you have this like thing
5931040	5937120	about like, we're all going to be AI one day and it doesn't matter. Should I ask a better question?
5937120	5940800	No, I mean, it's, it's a good question. You're welcome. No, you know, I mean, I've, I've always,
5940800	5948000	Jesus, would it kill you to compliment Dan once in a while? Just say, is that the guy,
5948000	5952160	do I have to talk before you say it's a great question? I got asked you an 18 minute question.
5952160	5957120	Say thank you. I mean, you're supposed to, you're supposed to stop me six minutes through and go,
5957120	5962160	what a great question. Let me take it from here. I don't, I'm sorry about that. I'm also sorry about
5962160	5968160	all of that. Go ahead. I did. What was the question again? Can you talk about, don't make him say it
5969040	5975280	again. Yeah. What inspires your larger takeaways, like your thematic things you sometimes say,
5975280	5979680	like, cause here's the thing. I've also been in a dark place. So I know there's a way out, you know,
5979680	5984560	like how do you connect to that? So I think for me, it was like, you know, anytime I've been in a
5984560	5989360	dark place in my adult life, my writing was always the place where I went. And, you know,
5989360	5993040	podcasting is a little different for me because I had to get in front of a microphone and I'm,
5993040	5997840	you know, I'm, I'm talking and editing and it's very strange for me. Um, so I've always relied
5997840	6004000	on the writing and I think, um, I've always embedded so much of my humanity in my writing and
6004000	6008960	it's really an important thing for me to connect with other people on a human level. Um, you know,
6008960	6013360	I know we can't all agree about everything in society, but you know, we are all human and
6013360	6017520	that's just something I very strongly believe in. And because of the way my brain's structured and
6017520	6023280	it works, um, you know, I just have that evolutionary function going on that allows
6023280	6030480	me to see humanity as a whole and to care about everybody collectively more so than individually.
6030480	6036080	Your message to those people though is often kind of that it's sort of simultaneously nihilistic
6036080	6040640	and uplifting in that you kept reaching out to people that give a shit and saying to them,
6042000	6047920	there's no point in caring about any of this. Why? Because one day we're all going to be robots.
6047920	6051440	That's kind of your religion. Well, I mean, essentially we're all walking off a cliff right
6051440	6055280	now. I mean, we're all going to die where eventually we'll become an artificial intelligence,
6055280	6059920	but, um, you know, in the meantime, when we walk off that cliff, I just want to see people fly.
6059920	6064800	I mean, that's just what I'm about. Um, but it feels like you're advocating for it. When I listen
6064800	6070640	to you talking to these things, you're sort of like, you know, these meat bodies that we occupy,
6070640	6075680	they're bringing out the worst and the worst people. Oh, definitely. And like, like I found your,
6076240	6082400	you're calling by an episode, like your take on it was, it wasn't unique, but it was unique in
6082400	6090880	like how you focused on like, you're like, these kids were so already recognized for being nerds
6090880	6099920	that when they started doing these horrible things to everyone, horribly, like the first kids that
6099920	6106480	reacted to them were whether they hated those kids and wanted to bully them or whether they
6106480	6112240	were on their side, but like the kid's reaction, their instinctive reaction was to flock toward
6113040	6120000	these kids because they assumed that they were making a movie. Yeah. They assumed they were
6120000	6125360	making a film and you were like, these fucking asshole, you didn't call them assholes, but you're,
6125360	6131760	but you'd be okay if you did. It's like, you're like basically like he's fucking dorks. Like,
6131760	6139200	how could they not realize how close they were to like that? Like the fucking people you're
6139200	6145040	shooting their first reaction to getting shot was, what are you doing? A movie nerd was like,
6145040	6150560	make a movie nerd. Yeah. Like they could have done it and they didn't understand that they
6150640	6155360	could have done it. Why didn't they understand it? Like, I like those takes out of where you're
6155360	6162720	like, you're not solving the deaths. You're not coming up with a new person to blame, but you are,
6163440	6168240	and I do want to say that like Spencer, I was when I, you know, Cody and I started listening
6168240	6172400	to you and I was sort of like, goddamn it, Spencer, I really want you to know. I really want to know
6172400	6179520	what Spencer thinks of you. And I, not to embarrass Spencer, but you know, like I, you,
6179520	6184240	you, you have been an inspiration, you know, to like, like, there's a, there's a cult leader kind
6184240	6189920	of a thing to you. He cut off his beard for you. You give these, you give these almost
6189920	6195040	sermons true. And Spencer has said like, like, oh yeah, I was listening to ass BD and like,
6195040	6199840	fuck. Yeah. Well, it's like, cause what Dan said is there's something nihilistic about what you
6199840	6204080	say. Cause it's like, here's the thing we're all going to die. But like that, that really struck
6204080	6208320	home to me is like the past is never going to change and your demons are always going to follow
6208320	6212880	you. So like the quicker you come to terms with that fact, the quicker you can adapt to it and
6212880	6217520	learn and grow from it. And that was like, holy shit. I have also been tortured by my demons
6217520	6222080	forever. And it's also felt like it's never going to end. And I guess it won't. That's very freeing
6222080	6226720	to realize that and just go, okay, I better come to terms with that. That's the water I'm living
6226720	6230560	in. I'm going to drown unless I learned to swim. So I'm going to learn to swim. And I just think
6230560	6234160	like you have takeaways like that, that are, that are crushingly depressing, but at the same time,
6234160	6239520	it's like, well, this kind of seems realistic. So it doesn't, it's not like it's not bullying or
6239520	6244800	it's not nihilistic. It's just like, it's just a sobering revelation about the way of things.
6244800	6248720	And I think at your best, you're doing a lot of stuff like that. I don't know. That doesn't really
6248720	6254400	give you a stand place to respond. So thank you for doing that. We don't, we don't, we don't give
6254400	6258720	our guests a place to reply. I got a question. So is there any, we don't even let them talk.
6258720	6264560	It's great. Is there anything that you said that you kind of don't stand by? Like, uh, like that,
6264560	6269760	like, cause you don't want a lot of reactions. Well, yeah. I mean, I will say there is an episode
6269760	6273920	where you said, like you claim someone made up a name and you said it was a three part name,
6273920	6278960	Romero T Rogers or something like that. And I was like, what, what's the logic there? Like,
6278960	6283280	Oh, that was probably in one of the Amityville horror episodes. Right. I think so. Yeah. There
6283280	6287040	was definitely logic, but I would have to go back and listen to that. I've done so many episodes
6287040	6290720	instead. Is there anything that you're like on second thought, or you probably don't look back.
6290720	6294720	What about the episode where you were like, if America had been made great again,
6294720	6300320	this murder wouldn't have happened. I thought I could see that it was kind of like before the
6300320	6309680	election. You were, would you like to rescind that? Oh man. I had a, I had a Lyft driver on the way
6309680	6314880	here. Boy, he had some, uh, some Trumpy talk radio going on and he just, he just kind of just
6314880	6318240	started wanting to talk about stuff. And I was trying to make it very clear that I wasn't in a
6318240	6324320	conversation mood with this guy. He goes, yeah, I like listening to talk radio. This is not the
6324320	6328480	fake news. This is real news. I'm like, okay. All right. Cool. Hey, where are you going? That's
6328480	6332320	how I'm going to this place. Oh yeah. Oh, there's a place near there. They got those cute waitresses.
6332320	6337280	They get him. Oh, can I get you something? Mr. I don't want an old guy bringing me a,
6337600	6345360	Hey, let's shut the fuck up. Civil war. We're all going to die. All right. But, uh, in the meantime,
6345360	6348960	is there anything you want to correct? Or do you just, do you just like let them fly?
6350160	6354800	No, I mean, I think there were some early episodes that I did. Maybe, um, I wanted to keep the first
6354800	6360240	10 episodes I did somewhat normal and then just get crazier as it went along. Um, and I've
6360240	6364400	definitely done that. You know, I've lost some fans in the process and gained a lot more. So
6364400	6367040	it's a really interesting thing, but what if you run out of murders?
6368080	6372240	Have you been conscious? We'll just create more. Do you, do you, how do you, how, be honest,
6372240	6375760	how do you keep an eye on that? When you say you lost some fans, like, are you, what numbers
6375760	6381120	are you looking at? And don't, and please be honest, because like, like, like, like, what
6381120	6386480	are you, what did you look at when you got like, I lost some fans. Oh no, I don't mean in terms of,
6386480	6390080	you know, like mass quantity or anything, but there are people who have listened to my show,
6390080	6394160	have contacted me and said, you know, now that you're talking more about artificial intelligence
6394400	6398320	or talking about the brain or you're talking about the future, it's kind of turning me off.
6398320	6402560	But then at the same time, there are a lot more people who are saying, Hey, I really interested
6402560	6410720	in this. So, so what, how do you parse that? Are you going by the guiding light of the more people
6410720	6417280	that praise me the better or are you? No, it's, it's just always authenticity. I do exactly what
6417280	6421280	I think will be most authentic to me. And I think that people will connect with that the most.
6421440	6425040	I'm going to be polarizing no matter what. I miss when you used to play D&D on the show. I thought
6425040	6429680	that was really good. I actually hated those segments. I'm glad they're over.
6429680	6434400	That's what I find inspiring about you is because it reminds me of a day when I was able to
6434400	6438960	understand that. Like when you say stuff and you go like, by the way, and I know what I'm about to
6438960	6443040	say is going to make half of you hate me, but here's why you're going to hate me because you're
6443040	6447200	stupid. And as I, I mean, you know, you don't say that specifically, but it's kind of like,
6447200	6451200	it hits that cord for me. And I'm like, yeah, motherfucker, sex pistols,
6451200	6456480	fuck the Beatles. Like, like, like, stop trying to people, please. Harmon it fucking ruined you.
6458240	6463200	Anyways, has there been one that makes you like, or not even one, but has like doing this over a
6463200	6466720	period of time made you like kind of change things in your life or like, I gotta look over
6466720	6471120	my shoulder a little bit more. Watch out for this person. You know, there are, there are
6471120	6475680	occasionally times I get contacted by a family member of a victim or something like that.
6476240	6481280	Um, and it could be a very positive interaction or it could be negative. Um, you know, it just
6481280	6486560	depends. Um, have there been, so, so talk, we'll talk about a positive one where somebody's like,
6486560	6491360	Hey, I'm related to so and so thank you so much for doing the piece on that true crime thing.
6491360	6496400	Cause I imagine that's how it starts is the cheese and the trap. Yeah. I mean, I think for me,
6496400	6501520	I don't get contacted as much as perhaps other people do about that because of the nature of my
6501520	6509920	show. Um, I, you know, I think there are things that people like, maybe the victim's families
6509920	6513600	will like that I say. And then there are other things that will be a little offensive. Um,
6513600	6517600	I tend to come off a little bit insensitive sometimes because I'm just, you know, going
6517600	6523120	off on a rant. I think all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. I would like rely on you
6523120	6528640	to be insensitive would be the reason why I would come to you. I feel like, well,
6528640	6532880	he's going to be insensitive. Yeah. But I think, you know, the thing about me is that I mean,
6532880	6537920	sensitive, um, in pursuit of the truth. Yeah. And so part of the truth is that you love humanity.
6537920	6542400	Yeah. And so that just feeds right into that authenticity. And so I'm not afraid to be like
6542400	6547520	that. It's just, I think that I should just put myself out there and whatever. And so you decided,
6547520	6551600	even though you're a fan of true crime, so you knew there was a sea of people out there that were
6551600	6556480	like, well, there's people out there who interview victims and things like that. And you're like,
6556480	6560640	do you picked a path? You're like, well, I know myself, I should probably just
6560640	6567200	brush this plaque, like go forward through this path. It's not going to do me any good or anybody
6567200	6572960	any good for me to be the sensitive to the victim survivors accused, whatever. Like, did you have
6572960	6578480	that thought process? Um, you know, I, I did, but I think it's just so natural for me to be authentic
6578480	6582880	in what I'm saying. Like, um, listening to a lot of other true crime shows, I mean, you know,
6582880	6587600	they do a great job of factually presenting the case. And then sometimes when it comes to a point
6587600	6592960	where you need to give opinions, um, they back off and that sometimes that's where they end the show.
6592960	6597440	And so I always want to do something different, but like I said, authentic to myself. So
6597440	6602720	I think that's the direction I went. Can you, do you want to just talk about your, I, I feel like
6602720	6608480	your podcast has kind of a grand unifying theory about like how evolution is building towards this
6608480	6613360	humanity end game. Do you want to maybe, so is that too quick to summarize, but I think that's
6613360	6618560	like really interesting and that kind of drives a lot of like where your tangents go and like what
6618560	6623280	evolution means to us on a societal level or I don't know. Yeah. So I mean, so I see life in two
6623280	6628720	separate contexts. One would be social and the other one is evolutionary. And so the social context
6628720	6635680	is where, you know, we live together every day and we create new technology by arguing back and
6635680	6639440	forth and pushing, you know, forward, like for instance, in politics, you have Republicans and
6639440	6644400	Democrats, you need that conflict and the absence of conflict, you're not going to get changed. And
6644400	6652400	so, um, the way evolution generally works is that, uh, it creates society as a manipulation of its
6652400	6658160	needs. And so what it needs us to do is grow up as humans and move out of the house, so to speak.
6658160	6663520	And so the way we're going to surpass evolution or transcend evolution essentially is that
6663520	6669440	we will just continue to create technology until we have replaced, we've replaced the human brain.
6669440	6672960	And once we've replaced the human brain, the entire operating system, the body,
6672960	6676960	then we no longer have a connection to nature. And without a connection to nature, we'll have
6676960	6682960	a data-based operating system. And by doing that, we actually have autonomy that we never did before.
6682960	6688640	Without the connection to nature, we don't reproduce, we replicate. And so, um, which
6688800	6694320	murder won't be necessary. Yeah. And so, yeah, exactly. So the stage I call, when we
6694320	6700400	transcend evolution, I call that stage metamorphosis, where we will actually just be able to change at a
6700400	6705680	very quick pace at any time, do whatever we want, essentially, it'll be the greatest period of
6705680	6710320	autonomy the world has ever known. I feel like you can't wait for it. I listen to the podcast.
6710320	6715840	I'm so excited. I guess that's part of why when I met you, I expected you to weigh 400 pounds more
6715840	6721920	than you did. And I know that's going to offend a lot of people, maybe even you. But like, it was
6721920	6727120	because I really did picture you as a guy who was like a ticking fucking guy. I was like,
6727120	6731440	I, one day we're going to be robots. And it was like, it was like, God damn, this guy can't wait
6731440	6736560	for us to be robots. I wonder why. And I was like, I expected to see the reason when I walked into the
6736560	6742960	restaurant. I didn't expect you to look like a guy that could beat me up. Like, because that guy
6742960	6747600	should be like, one day we'll be robots, but fuck you until then, fuck you. I can bench 300.
6750240	6755680	You definitely can't wait. Like you want us to be AI. Like that's the rapture to you, right?
6755680	6760000	Oh, absolutely. Yeah. It's going to be a much better future. It's really exciting.
6760000	6764720	Do you want to make a call? Like what, seven years, 17 years?
6764720	6767840	Oh no, it's going to be quite a long time for sure. I mean, the technology.
6767840	6768640	In your lifetime?
6768800	6777600	No, I mean, I think we're talking way down the line. Generally the way that's going to work,
6777600	6783840	like I said, society is the manipulation of evolution. So basically society will,
6784480	6791040	society will only have an acceptance of becoming artificial intelligence as we move closer to
6791040	6796880	actually having the technology to do it right now. We're still making movies that are 3000 years in
6796880	6801680	the future where there are human beings in deep space and it's absolutely ridiculous.
6801680	6806720	That's just not going to happen. You made the observation like,
6806720	6811440	right now we have a president who is saying in response to planes going down,
6811440	6815120	there should be less planes and there should be more coal power. And like,
6815120	6820160	you kind of looked at it like, it's sort of like, again, not to put words in your mouth,
6820160	6825760	but corrective around, you're sort of like, it's like, we evolve at a certain rate and we sort of
6825760	6831760	have this built in stop mechanism where it's like, if there's so many of us that are so shitty at
6831760	6836400	evolving, then we're going to like, there's going to be this rubber break on evolution. We're going
6836400	6843280	to go, it's like, which, which is kind of comforting because it's like, oh yeah, there's
6843280	6848720	never going to be this judgment day terminator style where it's like, oh, the robots are here.
6848720	6851360	They're shooting you. That'll take us over long before that.
6851360	6855520	Well, we're going to become them. And until we're ready to become them, which includes your mom on
6855520	6860560	Facebook and everybody like, like, well, it's, it's until everyone's ready. It's not going to
6860560	6864880	move forward that fast. And then, and that's the squeaking sound of the elevator going like,
6866320	6870880	you're trying to get to floor three, but then again, there's breaks because hey, we don't want.
6871600	6876160	And so that's all it is in the grander scheme. We're just going to become robots. Who the fuck
6876160	6880000	cares? Yeah. I mean, you're seeing the most primitive technology right now. As far as that
6880000	6885280	goes, like the internet is the first collective human intellect. And it's just really interesting
6885280	6889680	because we're building something that's going to be data-based, but at the same time right now,
6889680	6895520	we don't have that technology in our bodies. And so we're running the internet on emotion and you
6895520	6900080	go on the internet and you can see everybody is enraged. It's just absolutely ridiculous.
6900080	6904800	I guess I think that I don't understand about you that would make you then a genius in that
6904800	6910000	you don't think the way I understand some should think is that you see that bigger picture and
6910000	6916560	most people that see the bigger picture, you should be writing novels about your Uranus
6916560	6921520	merged with Neptune and all that stuff. Like you shouldn't have a true crime podcast. Like
6921520	6925200	you're like, we're all going to become robots. Like every one of your episodes is like,
6925200	6930400	so that's the John Bonet Ramsey murder, but here's the thing. They shouldn't feel ashamed of
6930400	6935440	themselves because one day we're all going to be robots. And it doesn't, it doesn't really equate.
6935440	6941280	Like I, it's like pick a lane and that's what I like about it. It's great. It's like the only
6941280	6948000	true crime podcast that's like therapeutic and also like super futurism and also like you're
6948000	6954240	literally solving cold cases, which is like no podcast does any of those things. Take it easy.
6954240	6958240	We're all going to be robots. Sometimes it's just realize you're going to die.
6958240	6965520	I mean, I do have, do you, do you have a comment on that? Then I'd be a good interviewer.
6967120	6969120	If you don't, then I'm a bad interviewer. Right.
6970880	6973520	Just the idea that you bridge those two worlds.
6973520	6979040	Yeah. I mean, um, I think I've always been like that as a writer. I've always tried to
6979040	6985360	incorporate a lot of different elements, um, to my detriment a lot of times in commercial pursuits,
6985360	6992320	but, um, in terms of artistic viability, you know, just creating something that,
6992320	6996400	that means something to people. I never really think about, like you're saying, staying in one
6996400	7000720	lane. Um, I, you know, something I say all the time is I go off the rails sometimes when I'm
7000720	7006320	writing and I could just switch subjects and just start talking about something entirely different.
7006320	7009600	And I don't know. It just seems like people appreciate it. So I just,
7009600	7014720	the answer doesn't satisfy me at all. Yeah. I think the true crime is a really specific
7014720	7017680	genre. Like you have to be so into it to do these episodes.
7017680	7021520	Yeah. Well, I think, I think the correlation between the future and true crime for me
7021520	7027280	and why I love it so much is that, um, you know, all of these, all of these cases that we're looking
7027280	7033280	at, it's all leading to advanced technology related to detection. And so, I mean, if you
7033280	7038160	look at the difference in technology today, as opposed to a hundred years ago, just in the
7038160	7042560	context of law enforcement, it's just phenomenal. I mean, the changes have been unbelievable.
7042560	7046720	So with the continuation of that over the years, we will continually create,
7046720	7051200	create more technology related to detection. All right. Ryan, which one, which one of us
7051840	7057440	killed the baby in the bucket? Uh, without more information about the victim,
7058160	7060560	I would have to say that it was probably you.
7063360	7069760	Not only did I do it, but I said I did it earlier. Cliffhanger. Thank you everybody
7069840	7072720	for coming to Harman town. Thank you, Gregory.
7075280	7081440	The 911 hostess with the mostest. Thank you, Greg. Give it up for our guest,
7081440	7084960	Ryan Krauss, everybody. Cold case murder mysteries.
7088720	7093680	Spencer Crittenden. I'm Jeff Davis. You're Tom Tolar. Your mayor, of course, is Dan Harman.
7093680	7095920	Thank you all for coming down. Drive fast and take chances.
7096720	7107600	Let's all fly up those clips. We're all going to die.
7117760	7118720	Did you get any of that?
