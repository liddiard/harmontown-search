0	14000	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is now in session.
14000	26000	Please welcome the Mayor of Harman Town, Jen Harman.
26000	41000	Thank you so much for last minute Comptroller.
41000	44000	Oh, thank you for having me, Dan.
44000	46000	You're old hat at this now.
46000	49000	I love Comptroller. It's like my favorite thing.
49000	51000	I'm sorry, I didn't even hear that you called my name.
51000	54000	I thought people were just excited that the show was happening.
54000	59000	I usually wait to see if they're excited for me to be here.
59000	62000	Please welcome...
62000	64000	This fucking guy.
64000	66000	B.J. Black-Bassowitz.
66000	68000	This fucking guy is here too.
68000	70000	From Castle Holmenstein.
70000	75000	Oh yeah, that's what Hitler wanted us to look like.
75000	78000	That's a huge compliment.
78000	80000	Do not take that the wrong way.
80000	82000	You are very handsome.
83000	85000	You look like Duke Nukem.
85000	88000	That is, yeah.
88000	92000	Did you know that Duke Nukem is related to B.J. Blackowitz from the...
92000	95000	What? No way. Are you serious?
95000	98000	In the canon of video game stuff, okay.
98000	100000	This is very deep.
100000	102000	I just want to say a couple of things.
102000	105000	Just a couple of things so you can keep the bullet train moving.
105000	109000	The San Diego thing we talked about last week.
109000	114000	So the sexual harassment, the cosplay thing?
114000	115000	Yes.
115000	117000	And I don't think we touched upon it last week.
117000	120000	I don't know if it was a thing last week.
120000	122000	The touched upon it there.
122000	124000	No, we touched upon it a lot.
124000	127000	Is that your joke? Is that the audience?
127000	129000	Their small minds are very easily...
129000	134000	It's that kind of dot connecting that makes sexual harassment happen.
134000	137000	You guys are worse than sexual harassers.
138000	139000	Yeah.
139000	146000	I don't know if we mentioned the young lady who's become the poster child of cosplay sexual harassment.
146000	149000	Well, we thought that she'd gotten attacked.
149000	155000	And I kind of want to sidestep because I don't know whether or not she...
155000	156000	I don't know.
156000	158000	Let other podcasts talk about that.
158000	162000	I only narcissistically wanted to talk about that incident for one reason,
162000	165000	which is that there was this one article, and I can't remember what publication it was,
165000	168000	but one of the Rick and Morty writers pulled it up and said,
168000	174000	there's this huge article about cosplay and sexual assault and harassment,
174000	180000	a terrible article outlining the whole thing and terrible dark darkness,
180000	184000	darkness, cosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault, cosplay, sexual assault.
184000	189000	And at the bottom of the article, there's this kind of the equivalent of some stock photography
189000	191000	of some people cosplaying.
191000	197000	It was the couple that dressed as Mr. Meeseeks at the...
197000	201000	No such thing as bad press.
201000	205000	It's just great to have stuff out there.
205000	208000	You can't control how it gets out there.
208000	211000	It was the weirdest sensation of my life because I'm like,
211000	215000	I'm a nerd and this girl got hurt or too dingy or whatever.
215000	221000	I'm like, this thing is like, oh, shit, that's going to pump us up like 1.7.
221000	223000	All right.
223000	225000	There's Frank.
225000	227000	I don't think that's his name.
227000	229000	Nope, it's not.
229000	231000	That guy just ran out with the vodka bucket.
231000	233000	People are just running out on stage this show.
233000	235000	Day late, dollar short.
235000	240000	Okay, there was a homeless guy in the Starburns parking lot, apparently,
240000	243000	and I was really bummed out because I was working late at Starburns,
243000	248000	the animation studio, and our writer's assistant, Adam,
248000	251000	got a call from a PA who said,
251000	254000	I walked out, there was a guy, he's parked on this spot,
254000	257000	and he's got a blanket over him, and I don't know what's going on,
257000	260000	so I called the non-emergency police line.
260000	262000	Which is, is it 311?
262000	264000	I don't know, 910.
264000	266000	Okay.
266000	267000	It's not quite 911.
267000	268000	Yeah, right.
268000	269000	Back it off.
269000	272000	911 less than one.
272000	274000	And I was like, okay, I guess that's, I don't know.
274000	277000	And we walked out the back, and there were three squad cars,
277000	280000	and there was a homeless kid who obviously just wanted a safe place to sleep,
280000	283000	and I'm part of the problem.
283000	285000	I just, and I'm living with that, and I thought,
285000	288000	if I said it to these kids, I could somehow gain something.
288000	291000	You're not going to get to him, though, this message,
291000	293000	because he probably doesn't listen to podcasts.
293000	296000	No, his life is probably fucking ruined now.
296000	301000	He maybe could have, with one night's safe sleep, in my parking lot.
301000	302000	Turned it around?
302000	304000	He could have fucking gained a foothold.
304000	306000	And I came down on him like a fucking,
306000	309000	like I didn't even know I was doing it.
309000	311000	I'm part of the problem.
311000	313000	All right, enough of that.
313000	314000	Wedding planning is fun.
314000	316000	Is it?
316000	322000	Some of these segues are rough, Dan.
322000	326000	When you wedding plan, you get to make a whole list
326000	329000	of all the people you've ever known in your entire life,
329000	332000	and do nothing with the person you love,
332000	336000	but talk shit about all of them.
336000	339000	It's almost worth getting married.
339000	341000	Even if you don't really love someone,
341000	343000	I recommend getting married,
343000	347000	because there's so much shit you could get to do.
347000	350000	Just like deciding, like, I don't know, these people.
350000	351000	This is just fun.
351000	353000	It's a fun activity to just make a list
353000	355000	of everyone you've ever known in your whole life
355000	358000	and be like, meh, fuck them.
358000	361000	That does have to be satisfying.
361000	363000	Then there's a bunch of shit I wrote
363000	366000	while I was high at Sarah Silverman's party.
366000	370000	This is serious warning shit.
370000	371000	Serious warning shit?
371000	373000	Well, this is symptomatic.
373000	374000	Oh shit, what did I...
374000	377000	I'm reading my Evernote notepad.
377000	381000	This is when I was at a party of a friend of ours
381000	383000	on a rooftop overlooking Los Angeles.
383000	385000	This is what I typed into my notepad.
385000	386000	Yeah.
386000	388000	You kids, should I get high, Dan?
388000	389000	I don't know.
389000	392000	Do you want to think like this?
392000	394000	I'm not cutting any corners.
394000	395000	I'm not sanding any edges.
395000	397000	This is what I wrote.
397000	399000	Hydrophilic and hydrophobic.
399000	402000	Duality between being good at being between people
402000	404000	and being good at being between people
404000	408000	and whatever is beyond.
408000	410000	It should just say, don't smoke pot.
410000	412000	This is a PSN.
412000	414000	Please read that again.
415000	416000	Please.
416000	417000	I want to try and make sense of it.
417000	419000	Hydrophilic and hydrophobic.
419000	420000	Okay.
420000	422000	Duality between...
422000	424000	I'm on board so far.
424000	427000	Being good at being between people.
427000	429000	I just left.
429000	430000	I think I know what I meant.
430000	432000	I can tell you what I meant.
432000	434000	And being good at being...
434000	437000	So one side is being good at being between people.
437000	440000	The other side is being good at being between people
440000	441000	and whatever is beyond.
441000	442000	So you're either the...
442000	443000	Oh, you're a people person or not?
443000	445000	You're either the membrane of a cell
445000	448000	or you're the endoplasmic reticulum.
448000	451000	And you didn't feel like the membrane last night?
451000	454000	I was a membrane because I was out on the fucking rail.
454000	456000	I was like looking out over LA and I was like,
456000	459000	yeah, entourage, motherfucker!
459000	461000	I don't know what happened to me.
461000	463000	One of the guys from entourage was there.
463000	464000	Probably.
464000	465000	No, he was.
465000	466000	Okay.
466000	467000	I saw him.
467000	468000	And you were there and I didn't see you.
468000	469000	But a guy from Futurama...
469000	470000	We did.
470000	472000	We spoke for a while.
473000	478000	I earlier tonight apologized to you
478000	479000	for walking away from you
479000	481000	and you must have thought I was a crazy person
481000	483000	because you don't remember talking to me at all.
483000	485000	There were people walking up to me all night.
485000	486000	I was up against the rail.
486000	488000	There were people constantly walking up to me
488000	491000	and saying the nicest things to me
491000	493000	and I would talk for five minutes
493000	496000	and then they would go, okay, cool.
496000	499000	I'm going to go talk to Bill Maher.
499000	500000	Like they...
500000	502000	I was Charles Manson at that party.
502000	503000	I was just...
503000	504000	I'm not bragging.
504000	505000	All right.
505000	508000	It didn't sound like a brag day.
508000	510000	I was Charles Manson.
510000	511000	I don't want to...
511000	516000	I may or may not have rallied some profligate youth
516000	520000	into a few homicidal sprees.
520000	522000	Here's the other paragraph I wrote.
522000	524000	And then I have a little birthday present for you.
524000	525000	I know it's not your birthday,
525000	527000	but you're getting older like all of us.
527000	529000	Is that the present?
529000	531000	A reminder of mortality.
531000	532000	This is the next paragraph I wrote.
532000	533000	I'm very excited.
533000	537000	Well, like the girl in the cold open of Lethal Weapon 1,
537000	539000	I was like fucking over a rail
539000	541000	to the point where people were tweeting,
541000	544000	I think Dan Harmon is going to kill himself tonight.
544000	546000	I'm flattered.
546000	550000	I wrote this into my ever notepad.
550000	554000	A question of significance, period.
554000	558000	A topographic map of significance, period.
558000	561000	Everything has an attribute, comma.
561000	564000	Every attribute is numerical.
564000	567000	That means every society has a weighted numerical amount
567000	568000	of significance,
568000	570000	and every element of that society is significant
570000	572000	to the extent that it affects the significance
572000	576000	of that society.
576000	579000	Good morning, sober Dan.
579000	584000	You have one message from hi, Dan.
584000	585000	I got to say, for some reason,
585000	587000	that sounded racist to me.
587000	588000	Really?
588000	590000	You think the bottom line of that is don't trust black people?
590000	593000	You're going to use that to justify some shit.
593000	594000	All right.
594000	596000	So I have a special present for you.
596000	597000	Yeah.
597000	598000	I know you love music.
598000	599000	Yeah.
599000	601000	I know you love fame.
601000	602000	I love fame.
602000	603000	I love music.
603000	604000	Those are my favorite things.
604000	608000	I want you to tell me, Dan,
608000	611000	you can't have famous people at Harmon Town.
611000	614000	This isn't a show for famous people to come out?
614000	616000	No, this isn't a show for famous people to come out.
616000	617000	Challenge me, challenge me.
617000	620000	There's no way you have anybody huge on the show tonight.
620000	621000	Fuck you.
621000	623000	Tenacious D, get out here.
623000	645000	I love this one.
645000	665000	Can't you see?
665000	666000	He's the man.
666000	667000	Let me hear you applaud.
667000	668000	He is more than the man.
668000	670000	He's a shiny golden God.
670000	674000	If you think it's time to fucking rock and fucking roll out of control,
674000	676000	well, then you know you got to rock the block.
676000	678000	You fucking sock a fucking cock.
678000	682000	Because when you rule, you fucking spool all of the fools out of their shoes.
682000	683000	Because if you think it's time to-
683000	684000	If you think it's time to-
684000	685000	If you think it's time to-
685000	689000	If you think it's time to fucking rock.
689000	691000	He is going to take a fucking ass,
691000	694000	and you know his name is Kyle Gass.
694000	699000	Rocking and fucking rolling and fucking rocking and fucking rolling and fucking-
730000	738000	Jack Black and Kyle Gass.
738000	743000	They're leaving.
743000	746000	There's probably some stuff if your fans are there,
746000	748000	so you should probably-
748000	751000	You might want to know about some stuff they're doing, I think.
751000	753000	And I don't quite know what it is.
753000	754000	Festival Supreme.
754000	756000	Yeah, festivalsupreme.com.
756000	758000	They're doing this festival on October 25th.
758000	760000	Downtown LA.
760000	761000	Amazing people are on it.
761000	763000	Obviously, those guys are on it.
763000	766000	I'm on it, but there's huge, huge awesome people on it,
766000	768000	and I kind of think of one person right now.
768000	772000	Do you know when it is, how they can see it, what it is, dot com, dot org?
772000	775000	I just said all that, but I'll say it again.
775000	776000	I'm drunk.
776000	781000	October 25th, go to festivalssupreme.com, get tickets.
781000	783000	It's downtown LA.
783000	786000	It's a huge, huge, amazing festival.
786000	788000	Fred Armisen's doing something.
788000	789000	Bill Hader is doing something.
789000	791000	The Workaholics guys are going to be there.
791000	792000	Are you?
792000	795000	Yes, I will be there.
795000	803000	We spoke last night.
803000	806000	I was this close to jumping down.
806000	808000	You didn't really consider that, right?
808000	809000	I think about it sometimes.
809000	811000	I did Bill Maher.
811000	815000	I met Bill Maher last night, and I literally got tongue tied.
815000	819000	He said hi to me, and I couldn't get the words out,
819000	820000	because I'm so scared of him.
820000	822000	Because you were afraid you were going to be like,
822000	824000	you're a fucking dick.
824000	826000	No comment.
826000	829000	I was just very intimidated by him.
829000	830000	I admire him too.
830000	834000	He's a very distinct face, and I saw Bill Maher hanging out.
834000	835000	Yeah.
835000	840000	And probably he doesn't care that I mention that he was smoking a joint.
840000	841000	It's just such a weird...
841000	843000	He was just walking around a party.
843000	844000	It was like, Bill Maher.
844000	846000	It's weird to see a famous face.
846000	848000	Hey, Kumail, do you think...
848000	850000	Would you liken me to like a star fucker?
850000	851000	No, dude.
851000	852000	There's no stars.
852000	854000	I mean, Canations D, that was a fucking food.
854000	858000	Do you think that this show is suffering because it has celebrities?
858000	859000	Is that what you think?
859000	860000	No, no.
860000	862000	So you just want to hang out and talk to me.
862000	866000	You don't think that famous people coming up on the show is important?
866000	868000	I think it really sells the show out,
868000	870000	so I hope you have nobody else who's famous.
870000	871000	Fuck you.
871000	872000	Dana Carvey's here.
873000	874000	Fuck you.
880000	882000	Isn't that fucking special?
882000	883000	Yeah.
886000	888000	Could it be Satan?
889000	890000	You bitches.
892000	894000	I'm trying to get hip.
894000	895000	Where do I sit?
895000	896000	You sit anywhere you want?
896000	897000	It's a mic for every chair.
897000	899000	Thank you very much.
899000	900000	This is in the way.
901000	902000	Yeah, well, you can...
902000	903000	Yeah, there you go.
903000	905000	Anyway, thanks for coming.
905000	906000	And Dan Harmon.
906000	907000	Thank you.
907000	908000	Thank you.
908000	909000	Camille.
910000	911000	This is...
911000	912000	I just want to...
912000	913000	Could we...
913000	914000	Could you guys get a little closer?
914000	917000	Is there any way to get them a little closer?
917000	920000	Because I don't feel as connected as I would with them that far away.
920000	923000	Is there any way to scooch up just a little bit?
923000	926000	You're used to the SNL days where they were in like a hyperbaric chamber.
926000	927000	The SNL days?
927000	928000	What are you saying, Dan?
928000	931000	You're orbiting a space shuttle and then your stages would rotate.
931000	932000	It was nothing.
932000	937000	You'd be sitting in a chair like this and then there'd be like five seconds and then
937000	941000	the red light would come on and you knew there were 20 million people and the cue cards were
941000	944000	not properly placed and you had to improvise.
944000	945000	Are you nervous yet?
945000	947000	What year did you start?
947000	948000	1947.
950000	952000	How do I look this good?
952000	953000	You look fucking great.
953000	955000	I don't want to be that guy but you look fucking amazing.
955000	956000	I think I love you.
956000	957000	No, I was A86.
957000	964000	So when I was a kid, I talked to people who I've been fortunate enough to have a career
964000	970000	path where I have friends who have written an SNL and have been an SNL and it's like,
970000	974000	okay, institutional comedy is stupid and bullshit.
974000	976000	How could that ever be funny?
976000	980000	At the same time, it's like holy shit and walking down the halls or there's a poster
980000	984000	of John Belushi's headshot is on the wall, et cetera.
984000	986000	And SNL has endured.
986000	990000	It's the only comedic institution that we have in this country that's lasted as long
990000	991000	as it has.
991000	995000	Well, what I did does seem very old-fashioned now and it did become, when I did the show
995000	999000	in 96 with Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, you guys familiar?
999000	1001000	The Dana Carvey sketch show.
1001000	1007000	By that point, we thought it, I discovered that it was really considered corny and hack
1007000	1011000	to have a character with a catchphrase that you would repeat, you know?
1011000	1013000	But they're hard to come by.
1013000	1015000	I mean, well, isn't that special?
1015000	1016000	My God.
1016000	1020000	No, once you fucking resonate, you don't back away from that.
1020000	1021000	No.
1021000	1023000	You are a people pleaser.
1023000	1026000	I want to destroy the audience.
1026000	1032000	I need to have, you know, but condescension is still funny to me, even though the character
1032000	1037000	is so hacky, a guy in drag, and I noticed it was, you know, I didn't have fake tits
1037000	1038000	or anything.
1038000	1039000	First of all, it's not hacky.
1039000	1042000	It was very specific, and it's still very, very funny.
1042000	1046000	Well, well, well, that's easy for you to say.
1046000	1050000	My boner just started.
1050000	1056000	Condescension is funny, and she's the ultimate patronizing.
1056000	1057000	It starts with we.
1057000	1059000	We like ourselves, don't we, Dan?
1059000	1062000	We did a show called Community.
1062000	1066000	Now it's on a thing called Yahoo.
1066000	1071000	You know, it's just, it's a sausage factory that you can work through in the attitude.
1071000	1076000	I realized later that I am passive aggressive, a nice passive aggressive guy, and a lot of
1076000	1079000	my characters were just passive aggressive, you know?
1079000	1080000	So like...
1080000	1083000	Hans and Franz, same thing.
1083000	1086000	Explain how Hans and Franz are passive aggressive.
1086000	1091000	Well, first of all, when we did them, you know, obviously it was born on Arnold and
1091000	1092000	this and that.
1092000	1094000	Kevin and I were touring with Dennis Miller.
1094000	1098000	We saw Arnold on TV, and we loved how he was...
1098000	1100000	He always wins, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
1100000	1101000	Everything is organized.
1101000	1102000	So this is what he said.
1102000	1105000	You know, you're on the road and you get to a hotel.
1105000	1106000	I'm just quoting.
1106000	1109000	I know the voice is fun.
1109000	1110000	I can do it.
1110000	1111000	They're happy.
1111000	1112000	I'm happy.
1112000	1113000	All right.
1113000	1114000	You do the stairs.
1114000	1120000	You break a nice sweat, and you take a light shower, and you put on a light white cotton
1120000	1123000	shirt, and you're ready for the evening.
1124000	1125000	We thought that was so cool.
1125000	1130000	We repeated it for weeks and weeks, and then we came up with the sort of mentally deficient
1130000	1135000	cousins, and when we first came out with the padding, the audience expected us to be super
1135000	1136000	strong and lift up...
1136000	1139000	And they soon found out we were never going to lift weights.
1139000	1144000	We were paranoid and delusional, and we were fighting imaginary enemies.
1144000	1145000	We were just stoked about fitness.
1145000	1146000	Yeah, if you don't think...
1146000	1149000	Yeah, but there was that imaginary enemy.
1149000	1155000	If you doubt us, if you think that we are not properly pumped up men, we could stretch
1155000	1161000	the flab of your back into the shape of a ladder, and you could crawl back down in the
1161000	1165000	sewer, because that's where losers live.
1166000	1168000	So that was the whole...
1169000	1171000	So it had a cartoon artifice.
1171000	1176000	I never connected the dot that the church lady and Hans and Franz, that's the thing they
1176000	1179000	have in common, is that they're inactive.
1179000	1181000	They are passive aggressive.
1181000	1186000	Yeah, and I am developing a church lady, Hans and Franz cartoon adventure movie.
1186000	1189000	I had a booth at Comic-Con and...
1191000	1192000	Camille, why so quiet?
1192000	1195000	My teeth are vibrating from excitement.
1196000	1197000	I fucking love you.
1198000	1199000	Camille, do you hear me?
1200000	1201000	Let me tell you, man.
1203000	1205000	You are something very special, my friend.
1207000	1209000	Yeah, so anyway, that was that.
1210000	1212000	You're sitting over there with your thing.
1213000	1214000	It's fun to do.
1214000	1215000	Everyone does it.
1215000	1218000	All of your impressions are...
1218000	1220000	Everyone flocks to do them.
1220000	1224000	No one knew how to do an impression of George Bush until you did it.
1224000	1226000	I went to school the next day.
1226000	1234000	I told you backstage, I was in sophomore year.
1234000	1237000	I remember I could tell you the color of the walls.
1237000	1243000	I could tell you what was on the jock straps on the floor when I gained respect from the
1243000	1250000	guys that would have otherwise been beating me up because I did my huge air quotes, my
1250000	1253000	impression of Jimmy Stewart.
1253000	1254000	Oh, Jimmy Stewart?
1254000	1255000	I thought you were going for George Bush.
1255000	1258000	Because I had watched SNL and you had done your...
1258000	1262000	And then the jocks would go like, hey, Harmon, do Jimmy Stewart.
1262000	1263000	They don't know who the fuck Jimmy Stewart is.
1263000	1264000	Neither did I.
1265000	1266000	Right.
1266000	1267000	I knew that you...
1267000	1269000	But you'd seen It's a Wonderful Life, right?
1269000	1270000	No, no.
1270000	1271000	Okay.
1271000	1272000	Absolutely not.
1272000	1273000	So can we hear your version?
1273000	1276000	So I would go, oh, I can't get my locker open.
1279000	1280000	Now you do yours.
1280000	1283000	I worked that thing for 20 years.
1283000	1289000	There's nothing funnier and a visceral comic sense than Jimmy Stewart swearing.
1290000	1297000	So my first bit ever in the 70s in college, you know, doing stand up in these shitbox
1297000	1299000	clubs, something familiar.
1299000	1302000	Anyway, I'm doing William Shatner.
1302000	1304000	Anyway, it was like Jimmy Stewart is a waiter.
1304000	1306000	He's like, yeah, yeah.
1306000	1309000	So do you know what you want to order?
1310000	1312000	Because you want to go slow and kind of...
1312000	1313000	Yeah.
1313000	1316000	So you don't know what you want to order.
1316000	1317000	Yeah.
1317000	1320000	So you're going to make me wait.
1322000	1324000	Well, fuck you.
1326000	1328000	It's always funny, right?
1328000	1330000	It's only funny when you do it.
1330000	1333000	I mean, you did a million of those things.
1333000	1335000	I'm like, we fucking stood on your shoulders.
1335000	1339000	I would go to high school every day and I would be the funny guy in high school because
1339000	1342000	I did impressions of your impressions.
1342000	1345000	Well, I copied Jimmy Carter from Dan Aykroyd.
1345000	1348000	I used to record it on the TV and stuff.
1348000	1349000	A lot of times I didn't have...
1349000	1353000	What was your relationship with SNL when you were...
1353000	1356000	How old were you in 1975?
1356000	1359000	He didn't know basis, but I was...
1360000	1361000	Don't ask, don't tell.
1361000	1363000	Why is this white?
1363000	1365000	I need some pepper.
1365000	1367000	No, I was 20.
1367000	1370000	So I was 21, 22, 23, 24, whatever.
1370000	1371000	And it was this new show.
1371000	1373000	It was a variety show for hippies.
1373000	1375000	And then they were badass pirates.
1375000	1378000	To me, you know, John Belushi and Bill Murray.
1378000	1382000	Those guys, they would beat you up or make you laugh, you know?
1382000	1384000	So I was completely in awe of the show.
1384000	1388000	And I auditioned for it three times for you guys out there and women who were trying to get on the show.
1388000	1393000	Meaning that two times you went out there to New York, you stood on the stage in front of...
1393000	1394000	No.
1394000	1395000	And I've talked to people... No?
1395000	1397000	No, mine was one of the worst ever.
1397000	1398000	Get this, okay?
1398000	1399000	The Comedy Store.
1399000	1401000	Saturday Night Live people are out there.
1401000	1403000	Two years before I got the show.
1403000	1405000	One comic after another. No MC.
1405000	1406000	Just...
1406000	1407000	And now somebody...
1407000	1411000	So at midnight, this comedian named Sam Kennison goes up.
1411000	1412000	In his prime.
1412000	1415000	Who I thought was maybe the best stand-up ever.
1415000	1417000	Arguably the best stand-up ever.
1417000	1419000	Destroys, dismantles, levitates the room.
1419000	1420000	I'm off to the side.
1420000	1421000	And now it's...
1423000	1424000	I go up.
1424000	1425000	I'm going, isn't that special?
1425000	1427000	There's that dead silence.
1427000	1429000	I'll never be on Saturday Live.
1429000	1430000	I'm an asshole.
1430000	1432000	You were just going around back then.
1432000	1433000	Isn't that special?
1433000	1434000	I had five minutes.
1434000	1435000	Special.
1435000	1436000	Isn't everything special?
1436000	1437000	Isn't that special?
1437000	1438000	Isn't that special?
1438000	1439000	I don't know.
1439000	1441000	When are people going to realize how special everything is?
1441000	1443000	In desperation, I went, well, fuck you.
1445000	1447000	And I still didn't get the show.
1447000	1448000	So I didn't, you know.
1448000	1452000	But you stopped me in the middle of that.
1452000	1453000	You go out...
1453000	1458000	When you audition for SNL, you go out to New York, you go out on the stage.
1458000	1460000	There is absolutely no...
1460000	1466000	From what I've heard, there are eight people sitting in the back of a dark room.
1466000	1469000	They are instructed not to laugh.
1469000	1472000	There are video cameras pointed at you everywhere.
1472000	1477000	And you know, because you've walked past the writer's room on your way to the audition,
1477000	1480000	you fully know that there is a feed to the writer's room.
1480000	1486000	You can see that there is a room full of sarcastic, snarky writers
1486000	1489000	who are watching every audition in their own room.
1489000	1494000	You walk past that reality and walk out onto a dark stage under a thrust.
1494000	1497000	And Lauren, I realized later, wanted to test you.
1497000	1498000	Because I'm bombing out there.
1498000	1501000	I was doing chopping broccoli on the piano and doing these things.
1501000	1502000	And then there was a pause.
1502000	1504000	It was Lauren and like Nora Dunn and three other people.
1504000	1508000	And Lauren said, do you have anything else that we could see?
1508000	1509000	Is there anything...
1509000	1511000	Or are you just going to do that?
1513000	1514000	And I realized...
1514000	1516000	Are you just going to keep chopping broccoli?
1516000	1519000	Isn't the broccoli chopped at this point?
1519000	1521000	At this point, I would you think you could...
1521000	1523000	Fucking chop broccoli.
1523000	1526000	I'd say the broccoli would be diced at this point.
1526000	1530000	So it's like he was testing to see when the red light went on if you wouldn't just go...
1530000	1531000	Like Meltdown.
1531000	1533000	What do you mean by that though, really?
1533000	1537000	Well, literally, the Meltdown wouldn't be so much that you just cry and go off.
1537000	1539000	But it would be that you would stumble, bum.
1539000	1541000	Because they're flipping credit cards.
1541000	1544000	They were vetting for people who were good at auditioning.
1544000	1547000	As opposed to people who could be part of a live show.
1547000	1550000	Yeah, you know, the first three years, it's just ridiculous.
1550000	1552000	I mean, you see how people go out there.
1552000	1553000	You don't really know.
1553000	1554000	It's in the cards.
1554000	1555000	You don't know your lines.
1555000	1556000	The show's under rehearse.
1556000	1558000	You don't want to look like you're reading the cue card.
1558000	1562000	So like if I was doing a scene with you and it's like, hey, let's go get some milk.
1562000	1564000	I know there's a card over there.
1564000	1566000	So I didn't want to just do the split thing.
1566000	1567000	God forbid.
1567000	1569000	So I'd go, let's go for milk.
1569000	1571000	And then I would kind of look over there for my next line.
1571000	1573000	Grab it and come back, you know.
1573000	1575000	And Phil Hartman was the best at that.
1575000	1578000	Well, they were testing for that in the audition, were they?
1578000	1579000	No.
1579000	1581000	Well, let me back up one story that's a little interesting.
1581000	1584000	So I auditioned at the Comedy Store in the Improv.
1584000	1585000	I always bombed.
1585000	1586000	I didn't get SNL.
1586000	1588000	It came around again in 86.
1588000	1590000	Rosie O'Donnell was playing Igby's on the west side.
1590000	1592000	100-seat club, kind of like this, small.
1592000	1594000	I didn't know Rosie.
1594000	1597000	But I said, can I go there and audition for the show?
1597000	1599000	Because Lauren Michaels was going to see me.
1599000	1603000	So she allowed me to come in and do like 40 minutes in a room like this.
1603000	1605000	And Lauren showed up.
1605000	1606000	Remember, I'm not on TV.
1606000	1613000	I'm scared at Saturday Night Live with Cher and the president of the network at the time.
1613000	1617000	So it's just like I was just so scared and so nervous.
1617000	1619000	But it was a regular audience like this.
1619000	1620000	I did OK.
1620000	1621000	That really helped me get the show.
1621000	1623000	Did you talk to Cher?
1623000	1626000	No, I never really liked her.
1627000	1630000	So you probably don't have like a really good Cher impression.
1630000	1632000	No, I never worked on Cher.
1632000	1633000	Do you want to hear mine?
1633000	1635000	Yeah.
1635000	1636000	I don't know.
1636000	1637000	I like it.
1637000	1639000	It's based on someone else's.
1639000	1640000	Half breed.
1640000	1641000	Oh, yeah.
1641000	1643000	Half breed.
1643000	1644000	Oh, sorry.
1644000	1650000	You can't have a Cher impression without...
1650000	1651000	Do you want me to hear...
1651000	1652000	Christmas lights.
1652000	1653000	How about Jimmy?
1653000	1656000	Jimmy Stewart explains the banking crisis.
1656000	1659000	Because all I ever knew about banking was from It's a Wonderful Life.
1659000	1662000	Mr. Potter, there's a run on the bank, you know, kind of thing.
1662000	1664000	So here's what they did, see.
1664000	1667000	You see, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, see.
1667000	1671000	They took the bad mortgages and they packaged them into an investment vehicle,
1671000	1674000	kind of like a security, see.
1674000	1675000	Yeah.
1675000	1679000	And then they got Moody to put four stars on them, an S&P, you know,
1679000	1684000	and they sold them to investors, but they knew they were bad.
1684000	1686000	So they did a thing, they shorted them, see.
1686000	1688000	So they bet against them while they sold them.
1688000	1690000	So if they lose, they win.
1690000	1693000	If they win, they win.
1693000	1698000	And you all put together, well, fuck you.
1698000	1699000	Okay, now...
1699000	1700000	This is the first time...
1700000	1702000	It's making Jimmy Stewart contemporary.
1702000	1705000	This is the first time I've understood the housing crisis.
1705000	1707000	I never fucking paid attention.
1707000	1708000	You know what?
1708000	1710000	Like, those fuckers.
1710000	1712000	It really is kind of that simple.
1712000	1715000	It feels like you're in a taking request mode, so I...
1715000	1716000	I'll do and say whatever.
1716000	1718000	I'm not going to make you do anything.
1718000	1719000	I'll do and say whatever.
1719000	1724000	But I would only say that it would be interesting to hear what would happen if Ted Kennedy...
1724000	1727000	Ted Kennedy?
1727000	1732000	When I returned, Mary Jo and the car were gone.
1732000	1740000	If Ted Kennedy got into a hotel room and found out that Kirk Douglas had the same hotel room,
1740000	1742000	and that they...
1742000	1743000	Because they both...
1743000	1745000	The hotel was overbooked.
1745000	1746000	Can't I deal with Burt Lancaster?
1746000	1749000	Okay, all right. Burt Lancaster is there, too.
1749000	1752000	I did a movie with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.
1752000	1759000	Years later, I learned to do them, and I don't really like blue humor and the sense of anal penetration and...
1759000	1760000	Cheers.
1760000	1761000	She is.
1761000	1762000	Okay, I hate that.
1762000	1766000	But I like the old-fashioned vernacular applied to sexual situations.
1766000	1772000	So this is Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, two male macho superstar icons as lovers.
1772000	1773000	Here we go.
1773000	1777000	This is what made John Levitz throw up in a parking lot.
1777000	1781000	You mean because he was laughing so hard.
1781000	1782000	So hard, yeah.
1782000	1783000	Not to pat yourself on the back, but...
1783000	1784000	No, no.
1784000	1785000	John Levitz fucking...
1785000	1786000	John loves this.
1786000	1787000	This made him cute.
1787000	1788000	So it's Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas.
1788000	1789000	I want you.
1789000	1791000	I want you very bad.
1791000	1801000	It doesn't mean we're gay, we're two men having fun.
1801000	1806000	I'm inside you now.
1806000	1809000	I want you inside me.
1809000	1811000	And I need you.
1811000	1813000	And I want all of it.
1813000	1815000	And I don't want your system.
1815000	1817000	I don't want it all.
1817000	1820000	All right, son, slow down.
1820000	1823000	Don't keep bucking around like that.
1823000	1829000	You keep bucking around like that, I got to pull out and splooge all over your backside.
1829000	1836000	It's the poetry of it.
1836000	1840000	Can't do this on Fallon.
1840000	1841000	I love Jimmy though.
1841000	1846000	You did chopping broccoli on Fallon and fucking everyone went wild because chopping broccoli
1846000	1849000	is the comedic version of Dancing in the Dark.
1849000	1852000	You're the Bruce Springsteen of comedy.
1852000	1856000	Well, it was Jimmy's idea to do it with an orchestra this last time.
1856000	1860000	I don't know if you saw it, but I only did it once on SNL and I did it the very first show
1860000	1861000	right before the end.
1861000	1863000	You did it in your stand-up special, right?
1863000	1865000	That's what I for a stand-up special.
1865000	1868000	Yeah, but I only did it once on SNL.
1868000	1869000	I don't know why I resonate.
1869000	1870000	It's so stupid.
1870000	1873000	I think there's a ton of people in this audience probably.
1873000	1876000	I think the median age is probably 25.
1876000	1879000	Without doing a lot of math, I think that puts them around the age.
1879000	1884000	When I was 10 years old, Martin Short was like, that's how I learned about comedy.
1884000	1889000	I think the irony is that actually in SNL terms, Lorne Michaels wasn't even there.
1889000	1890000	Those were the upper solid years.
1890000	1891000	No, not that year.
1891000	1892000	I love the Martin Short.
1892000	1894000	But I was like, holy shit, Martin Short is the fuck it.
1894000	1897000	I would just go to grade school and I would do...
1897000	1898000	At Grimley?
1898000	1899000	Yeah.
1899000	1901000	I would do everything that Martin Short did.
1902000	1904000	And my hackness extended to high school.
1904000	1905000	I was still...
1905000	1906000	And then I was doing you.
1906000	1908000	I was going, oh, I'll be in Jimmy's door.
1908000	1909000	Can I go?
1909000	1911000	Can I be on a date with you?
1911000	1912000	I'm not gonna do it.
1912000	1913000	I'm not gonna...
1913000	1916000	At this juncture, will you be on a date with me?
1916000	1917000	It was all you.
1917000	1919000	Did you do John Travolta or Robin Leech?
1919000	1920000	Did you do some of the other...
1920000	1921000	I'm Robin...
1921000	1922000	Did you do...
1922000	1923000	Leech?
1925000	1926000	I wanna...
1926000	1929000	I wanna Christmas tree with lights.
1929000	1933000	I'm Robin Leech and I'm yelling and I don't know why.
1934000	1937000	Now, that is really an 80s reference.
1937000	1940000	I'm Robin Leech and I have a wonderful life
1940000	1943000	and I'm gonna pump you up.
1944000	1945000	I would just do that.
1945000	1946000	It's very good.
1946000	1947000	Let me tell you.
1947000	1948000	This is Regis Philbin.
1948000	1949000	I'm 87 years a bitch.
1949000	1950000	I love Regis.
1950000	1953000	I love what you have going on here, Dan Slobbin
1953000	1955000	or whatever your name is, Danny Kloefler.
1955000	1957000	And Farnell, you're terrific.
1957000	1958000	Whatever you feel.
1958000	1961000	When you get your green card, you can call me.
1961000	1962000	You're terrific.
1962000	1964000	Anyway, I love you all.
1964000	1965000	Your cover card bleep a letter.
1965000	1967000	It's a wonderful rhythm to do.
1967000	1968000	You just...
1968000	1970000	You take Groucho Marx and slow it down.
1970000	1971000	You know?
1971000	1973000	Pick a cigarette wood and divide it like a banger.
1973000	1976000	Pick a cigarette wood and divide it like a banger.
1976000	1978000	Pick a cigarette wood and divide it like a banger.
1978000	1981000	He's doing Groucho with a nasal a little bit faster.
1982000	1984000	So, hopefully kids are enjoying these.
1985000	1986000	Got it.
1986000	1987000	Got it.
1987000	1988000	Got it.
1988000	1989000	Do it.
1989000	1990000	I don't want to keep you.
1990000	1991000	I like yours better.
1991000	1992000	No, mine are great.
1992000	1993000	Mine are great.
1993000	1994000	Can I ask you a question?
1994000	1995000	When did you know you could do impressions?
1995000	1998000	I feel like certain people are just good at them
1998000	2000000	and certain people are just bad at them.
2000000	2003000	And in the good part, obviously some people are better than others.
2003000	2004000	You're fantastic.
2004000	2005000	When did you realize you could do that?
2005000	2007000	That I could alter my voice.
2007000	2012000	Literally, really, it was when the Beatles came on Ed Sullivan.
2012000	2013000	I was nine years old.
2013000	2016000	And we had a Collier's Encyclopedia LP
2016000	2018000	where the Beatles were being interviewed.
2018000	2021000	So, the first altering of my voice when I was nine years old,
2021000	2023000	and I had three older brothers and a younger sister,
2023000	2026000	was I was able, I was able, you know, and I'll do,
2026000	2029000	I'll do the bit, you know, it's like I go out to my mom,
2029000	2031000	you know, after the Beatles are on, I go,
2031000	2034000	hello, mom, do you think I could get me some pancakes?
2035000	2037000	Like a very musical.
2037000	2038000	Yeah.
2038000	2039000	So, that was the first voice.
2039000	2041000	You've been getting fucking pancakes ever since, huh?
2041000	2042000	Pancakes, you know.
2042000	2045000	And it's still, yeah, I do these for myself sometimes.
2045000	2049000	I mean, it's very comforting to be in this persona.
2049000	2051000	You know, it's better, here we are,
2051000	2055000	you have a little gooby gooby, it's doo doo doo, you know.
2055000	2060000	I mean, it's very, because McCartney is the most humble genius in the world,
2060000	2064000	you know, he won't go, you go, Paul, I just want to say, you know,
2064000	2067000	you know, we did some plunkers, you know.
2067000	2071000	John would get a guitar, and we'd face each other,
2071000	2073000	and we're plunking, you know.
2073000	2075000	And I'm looking at him, he's looking at me,
2075000	2077000	and we're plunking away.
2077000	2080000	And that's how we came up with Abbey Road.
2082000	2084000	But it's a comfortable, yeah.
2084000	2087000	And I do it for myself, this is not a joke.
2087000	2092000	George Bush Sr., that robotic monosyllabic thing is comforting for me
2092000	2095000	because I tend to tend toward anxiety.
2095000	2097000	But like I, he would say, he'd go,
2097000	2101000	well Camille, there, sidekick, nice mic,
2101000	2108000	quick-witted audience, there, just sodas, comic area,
2108000	2115000	Dan Harmon, writer, superb, community, yahoo, money.
2115000	2121000	It's just, we can just say thank you Dana Carvey for coming,
2121000	2124000	or you could hang out all night as far as I'm concerned, but.
2124000	2126000	Probably have peaked already, but.
2126000	2128000	Did they have any requests? I'll do one more.
2128000	2130000	Oh, okay.
2130000	2132000	He's taking requests.
2132000	2135000	Well, well, well, we raised our hand very quickly.
2135000	2136000	Garth?
2136000	2138000	Oh, Garth, yeah.
2138000	2141000	These people grew up on Garth.
2141000	2146000	Well, I'll tell you, real quickly, Garth, Mike,
2146000	2148000	the brilliant Mike Myers came in with Wayne,
2148000	2150000	and then he asked me to be a sidekick.
2150000	2153000	He said his name is Garth, and he digs Wayne.
2153000	2157000	And I saw, I saw he had brown hair, so I remember,
2157000	2160000	I went through the makeup area, and I saw I could do a blonde wig,
2160000	2164000	and I could wear those kind of Peter Seller glasses,
2164000	2168000	and then I didn't really have a construct for the surfer dude nerd,
2168000	2170000	like, what are you doing?
2170000	2171000	You know, that kind of thing.
2171000	2174000	Which is, we'll do it, how I ruin Wayne's World 2,
2174000	2176000	we can do next time, but.
2176000	2179000	By bad makeup and pushing too hard, yeah.
2180000	2181000	I'll tell you.
2181000	2183000	Did you produce Wayne's World 2?
2183000	2186000	Why would you take, why would you feel guilty of Wayne's World 2?
2186000	2190000	Well, I was 38, and there was a line in the movie
2190000	2194000	that Garth just, Garth just got pubes, you know, so.
2194000	2197000	And I'm 38 playing the character, and so the edict was,
2197000	2199000	we gotta cover my five o'clock shadow.
2199000	2202000	I'm not Richard Nixon, but if you watch the first movie,
2202000	2203000	I have very light makeup.
2203000	2206000	So they tried to cover my five o'clock shadow,
2206000	2209000	by the time they did that, then they caked it on.
2209000	2214000	So I'm, I look like an orange Betty Davis in the second movie,
2214000	2215000	and then my performance.
2215000	2216000	But anyway.
2216000	2218000	But what does that have to do with,
2218000	2220000	this is what's fascinating to me about you.
2220000	2221000	Right.
2221000	2225000	Your self-effacement, your self-awareness, your accountability.
2225000	2226000	Right.
2226000	2228000	In the face of being a fucking icon,
2228000	2233000	who is this guy who doesn't, like, Jim Carrey hasn't come out here yet,
2233000	2236000	but I think there's a kind of archetype that we have in our heads.
2236000	2238000	We're like, oh, this guy that comes out,
2238000	2240000	he makes everybody happy, he's this clown.
2240000	2241000	Right.
2241000	2244000	But you're so smart and so humble.
2244000	2245000	Thank you.
2245000	2247000	And so almost to the point of like, you say stuff like that.
2247000	2250000	No, there was really good stuff that I liked that I did here and there,
2250000	2252000	but most of it was disappointing.
2252000	2255000	How could that possibly be your fault?
2255000	2259000	What was your role in Wayne's World 2, aside from Garth?
2259000	2261000	Your job was to show up and play Garth.
2261000	2265000	Look, in the first movie, I mean, I trusted the rhythm in the first movie,
2265000	2268000	based on my brother, my brother Brad, who does.
2268000	2271000	I took the rhythm from my brother.
2271000	2273000	He would love to come on this podcast.
2273000	2274000	He's in LA.
2274000	2275000	He's welcome to.
2275000	2276000	He's great.
2276000	2282000	And he had this rhythm, and this was the best rhythm of Garth.
2282000	2286000	That was the goal, and I did it mostly in the first movie.
2286000	2288000	And then the second movie, you know,
2288000	2290000	it just became more cartoony, and I just lost that thread,
2290000	2291000	and I was pushing.
2291000	2295000	You blame yourself for fucking Wayne's World 2?
2295000	2296000	I do.
2296000	2298000	I fucked Wayne's World 2.
2298000	2300000	You're insane.
2300000	2301000	I am orange.
2301000	2304000	I am orange, and I'm pushing, and I'm mugging.
2304000	2307000	But in the first movie, I had some very nice moments
2307000	2309000	where I stayed in this rhythm.
2309000	2312000	This was the core of Garth.
2312000	2313000	And I look at it, and I go,
2313000	2316000	what the fuck happened to me that I pushed in the second movie?
2316000	2319000	Maybe it was the money.
2319000	2323000	I know you said in the green room you're sleepy.
2323000	2325000	Will you stay for just a little bit?
2325000	2326000	Sure, yeah.
2326000	2330000	I don't have a life.
2330000	2335000	Can I bring my...
2335000	2337000	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics,
2337000	2342000	Harman Town, now in session.
2342000	2345000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town,
2345000	2346000	Mr. Dan Harman.
2346000	2347000	Oh, Jeff.
2347000	2348000	Jeff.
2349000	2350000	Jeff.
2351000	2353000	Let's start this fucker.
2353000	2354000	Jeff.
2355000	2358000	I imagine you driving here, reading Twitter,
2358000	2360000	and being like, what the fuck is going on?
2360000	2362000	Tenacious D?
2362000	2363000	Dana Carvey?
2363000	2365000	Tenacious D with her?
2365000	2367000	Oh shit, Dana Carvey, hello.
2367000	2370000	Jeff, we started without you.
2370000	2372000	Now, what I was going to say is...
2372000	2373000	I overslept.
2373000	2374000	I set my alarm for the wrong...
2374000	2376000	I set my alarm for AM instead of PM.
2377000	2380000	It happens to podcasters too.
2380000	2381000	Yeah, it's okay.
2381000	2383000	You're not taking blame for that,
2383000	2385000	and he's blaming himself for Wayne's World 2.
2385000	2386000	Wayne's World 2!
2386000	2388000	That's why I wanted to bring up my fiancé,
2388000	2390000	my 29-year-old fiancé, Erin McGathey,
2390000	2392000	so that she could talk to...
2395000	2396000	Before you leave, Dana,
2396000	2401000	I wanted you to talk to the love of my life.
2401000	2403000	That's insane hearing that.
2403000	2406000	Your self-deprecation, it's too far.
2406000	2407000	It's too much.
2407000	2409000	There was good things I did.
2409000	2413000	That's just a bald-faced fact that I destroyed Wayne's World 2.
2414000	2416000	Listen, here's the example.
2416000	2417000	This is not my fault.
2417000	2419000	Is this what Mike Myers has been telling you, Dana?
2419000	2421000	Yeah, does he call you and leave?
2421000	2422000	Mike was...
2422000	2424000	Don't let him push you around.
2424000	2426000	No, Mike was consistent.
2426000	2427000	Mike was consistent.
2427000	2428000	Here's the story.
2428000	2430000	Okay, look, if you budget something,
2430000	2431000	they're going to spend the budget.
2431000	2434000	So the first movie, we had $12 million in 36 days.
2434000	2436000	So we're on the car, and he goes,
2436000	2437000	yeah, she's a babe.
2437000	2439000	And I go, yeah, if she was a president,
2439000	2442000	she'd be Abraham Lincoln, right?
2442000	2445000	So we make fun of corporate profiteering.
2445000	2446000	You know, we hold up the stuff.
2446000	2448000	Meanwhile, heroin's paying us.
2448000	2449000	Never mind.
2449000	2452000	The second movie, we have a $40 million budget.
2452000	2455000	And so Wayne and Gar suddenly have a loft
2455000	2457000	that is a $500,000 loft.
2457000	2460000	I remember walking into it and going, what?
2460000	2462000	What happened to the humble little set?
2462000	2464000	So everything got blown up.
2464000	2465000	Did you write the movie?
2465000	2468000	I basically, and another thing I regret,
2468000	2471000	I did the arc with Kim Basinger.
2471000	2472000	I did the...
2472000	2474000	Yeah, but did you write the movie?
2474000	2478000	Not the movie per se, but the Garth parts,
2478000	2479000	for the most part.
2479000	2480000	Dana Carvey?
2480000	2481000	What?
2481000	2484000	You have never done anything wrong, ever.
2484000	2485000	Oh, no.
2485000	2487000	You need to understand that.
2488000	2491000	You need to understand that you have never done anything wrong.
2491000	2493000	No, the first one was really good.
2493000	2498000	I mean, it did inflation adjusted like $275 million.
2498000	2499000	Not that I checked instant.
2499000	2500000	So Dana Carvey?
2500000	2501000	Inflation adjusted.
2501000	2504000	Dana Carvey, why do you think...
2504000	2505000	Can we just call it Dana?
2505000	2506000	No, Dana Carvey.
2506000	2507000	Why is that always Dana Carvey?
2507000	2508000	Dana Carvey.
2508000	2509000	Why?
2509000	2510000	Yes.
2510000	2511000	What was it?
2511000	2512000	So you went in the...
2512000	2514000	Why did it feel different making that movie?
2514000	2516000	You said it's a bigger budget?
2516000	2518000	It was a bigger budget.
2518000	2521000	My face was orange.
2521000	2522000	We...
2522000	2524000	You know, I think that...
2524000	2527000	Look, I mean, the first time we were on the car,
2527000	2528000	we had an hour to shoot that.
2528000	2530000	You know, Abraham Lincoln, Mike's laughing.
2530000	2531000	I'm laughing.
2531000	2534000	It's just like, you know, almost in one take.
2534000	2537000	Then the second time, we had two full days
2537000	2539000	to shoot us hanging out on the car
2539000	2543000	with like 55 takes of different camera angles.
2543000	2546000	So you tend to get bored and you tend to push, you know?
2546000	2547000	I mean, that's all.
2547000	2548000	That just happened to me.
2548000	2549000	Are you looking back on Wayne's World 2
2549000	2551000	as being some kind of point where you think...
2551000	2553000	Are you thinking that you did something wrong on that movie?
2553000	2554000	No.
2554000	2555000	No, I don't think I did anything wrong.
2555000	2556000	I just...
2556000	2557000	I did...
2557000	2558000	My instincts were a little off on that one,
2558000	2559000	but they were spot on in the first one.
2559000	2560000	So one out of two ain't bad.
2560000	2561000	May I...
2561000	2562000	May I...
2562000	2563000	I can't...
2563000	2564000	Is this gonna...
2564000	2565000	I have to apologize.
2565000	2566000	No, God, no.
2566000	2567000	I think it's important to have that conversation.
2567000	2568000	We've never...
2568000	2570000	Well, there's many other regrets I have.
2570000	2571000	What's that, baby?
2571000	2574000	I can't handle this show emotionally.
2574000	2577000	I'm losing my fucking mind.
2577000	2578000	I...
2578000	2580000	My hero...
2580000	2581000	I just...
2581000	2582000	I can't deal.
2582000	2584000	She loves Mike Myers.
2584000	2585000	I do, too.
2585000	2586000	His story.
2586000	2588000	She loves Burt Lancaster.
2588000	2589000	Such a thrill.
2589000	2592000	I've had the opportunity to meet many famous people.
2592000	2593000	I can't...
2593000	2594000	So...
2594000	2595000	Um, there were...
2595000	2596000	I...
2596000	2597000	I'm not completely...
2597000	2598000	It's not like...
2598000	2599000	I will start crying.
2599000	2600000	There was stuff that I liked.
2600000	2601000	I mean, I love Master of Heaven with Harry.
2601000	2602000	I love the McLaughlin reports.
2602000	2603000	I love the Carson's I did with Phil.
2603000	2604000	There was a lot of stuff I did like,
2604000	2605000	and I liked the first Wayne's World,
2605000	2606000	but second one, I fucked it.
2606000	2607000	I feel...
2607000	2608000	When I was in high school...
2608000	2609000	Uh-oh.
2609000	2610000	Dana, you know, backstage, I told you,
2610000	2611000	I really like you, and I said the words,
2611000	2612000	I don't care about how you feel about this,
2612000	2613000	and I said,
2613000	2614000	I don't care about how you feel about this,
2614000	2615000	and I said,
2615000	2616000	I don't care about how you feel about this,
2616000	2617000	and I said,
2617000	2618000	I don't care about how you feel about this,
2618000	2619000	and I said,
2620000	2621000	Dana, you know, backstage,
2621000	2622000	I told you,
2622000	2623000	I really like you,
2623000	2624000	and I said the words,
2624000	2626000	I don't care about how you feel about this emotionally,
2626000	2628000	I know that I'm embarrassing you,
2628000	2630000	but I like you so much.
2630000	2631000	Um...
2631000	2632000	Thank you.
2633000	2635000	You talked to my woman backstage?
2636000	2638000	I don't want it to rail the conversation.
2638000	2639000	Oh, yeah.
2639000	2640000	Please say you wrote a song.
2640000	2642000	I really want you to break into song right now.
2642000	2643000	I...
2643000	2644000	When I was in high school,
2644000	2647000	I had a Yahoo! email account,
2647000	2648000	and...
2649000	2650000	After speaking with Dana...
2650000	2651000	You had email in high school?
2651000	2652000	I did.
2652000	2653000	Wow.
2653000	2654000	Yeah.
2654000	2655000	She's a lot younger.
2656000	2661000	And I told Dana backstage that when his first HBO special
2661000	2663000	came out in 1995...
2663000	2664000	Mm-hmm.
2664000	2665000	Yeah.
2666000	2671000	I recorded it with my little tape player.
2672000	2676000	Kids, there used to be these boxes with tape inside them.
2676000	2677000	I recorded it,
2677000	2679000	and me and my brother both had copies of it,
2679000	2681000	and when we would walk to school,
2681000	2684000	we would look at each other for two years.
2684000	2685000	We would look at each other and be like,
2685000	2686000	and go,
2686000	2688000	and we would listen to Dana Carvey's special
2688000	2690000	on the way to school together,
2690000	2691000	and I went to...
2691000	2692000	I was like,
2692000	2695000	I feel like I may have written a diary.
2697000	2699000	All that makes me feel is like,
2699000	2700000	I wish I tried harder.
2701000	2703000	I think you tried really hard.
2703000	2704000	I really do.
2705000	2708000	If she's queuing something up,
2708000	2710000	I don't want to derail her.
2710000	2712000	But the overwhelming feeling I have
2712000	2714000	when I hear you talk about yourself,
2714000	2716000	because I don't think you're fishing for it,
2716000	2718000	I think you're a guy that worked really, really hard.
2718000	2720000	Because we didn't even talk about the fact
2720000	2723000	that you were on this Meg Ryan sitcom when you were...
2723000	2726000	Our public consciousness of you was like,
2726000	2728000	oh, you were on SNL, and then you were on SNL,
2728000	2731000	and then our radar blips and stuff.
2731000	2734000	But you worked your entire life.
2734000	2737000	You tried to make people laugh the entire time,
2737000	2738000	and you never stopped.
2738000	2741000	And I think that there's a million people
2741000	2743000	that we look at publicly, and we go,
2743000	2747000	oh, that guy, he thought he was something,
2747000	2748000	and then that's why he did this.
2748000	2749000	I think it was like,
2749000	2752000	you were a church lady, and you were Hans and Franz,
2752000	2753000	and you were doing the shit,
2753000	2755000	and then everyone loved you.
2755000	2756000	America loved you.
2756000	2758000	And then there were a couple movies
2758000	2759000	where you were with Nicolas Cage,
2759000	2761000	and you were going, hey, I'm a cat burglar.
2761000	2764000	And it was fun.
2764000	2766000	Is it Blank Slate?
2766000	2767000	Trapped in Paradise.
2767000	2768000	Clean Slate.
2768000	2769000	That movie's awesome.
2769000	2771000	Clean Slate is a fucking great movie.
2771000	2772000	Oh, man.
2772000	2774000	Well, I won't even go to there, but yeah.
2774000	2776000	I'll tell you what happened to me, though.
2776000	2778000	The idea that you're responsible for Range World 2
2778000	2779000	not being as good as Range World 1
2779000	2780000	is it's fucking insane to me.
2780000	2781000	That's so insane.
2781000	2782000	It wasn't totally mine.
2782000	2784000	I just was disappointed in my instincts.
2784000	2786000	But what happened to me is I did not.
2786000	2788000	I grew up very humble.
2788000	2790000	Dad was a high school teacher.
2790000	2791000	Five kids.
2791000	2794000	So between 80 and 86, when I was doing stand-up,
2794000	2796000	I took everything they gave me.
2796000	2798000	And because I had the reverse dumb blonde effect,
2798000	2800000	like I had a little teen idol thing going.
2800000	2803000	I had blonde hair, and I had a real baby face.
2803000	2806000	So no one thought I was a con...
2806000	2809000	Take it fucking easy.
2809000	2810000	No one thought I was a con.
2810000	2811000	Yeah.
2811000	2812000	I don't like where I'm sitting either.
2812000	2814000	Like a piece of bubblegum that can make children.
2814000	2817000	But that's why I did all those straight roles.
2817000	2820000	Although I will say, if I'm going to lose my fiancé to anybody,
2820000	2823000	I would like it to be Janet Carmen.
2823000	2824000	Can we hear this?
2824000	2825000	Is this real?
2825000	2826000	It's real.
2826000	2827000	It's real.
2827000	2828000	So this is like fan fiction?
2828000	2829000	What is this?
2829000	2832000	This is with my Yahoo Mail account.
2832000	2834000	I would email myself.
2834000	2835000	And you guys have done this before.
2835000	2836000	I like sent yourself.
2836000	2840000	There's no need for you to shake your head so aggressively.
2840000	2842000	I'm not really looking for people like you.
2842000	2844000	I'm looking for other people that are like, yes.
2844000	2848000	I don't need you to say no.
2848000	2851000	I'm glad they're getting married,
2851000	2855000	because I've just kind of got to know this dynamic.
2855000	2858000	And it seems like perfection.
2858000	2861000	I do love you immediately jumped into couples counseling us
2861000	2863000	upon meeting us after 30 seconds.
2863000	2866000	Stubbornness is the key to a long relationship.
2866000	2867000	Both are stubborn.
2867000	2868000	I hate you.
2868000	2869000	You hate me.
2869000	2872000	But I ain't quitting you.
2873000	2875000	With my Yahoo Mail account,
2875000	2877000	and I still do this with my current account,
2877000	2880000	I'll mail myself diary entries, basically.
2880000	2882000	I'm angry about this thing.
2882000	2883000	I like this thing.
2883000	2886000	But I had a feeling that maybe I talked about
2886000	2888000	Dana Carvey in one of these entries,
2888000	2891000	and I searched his name in my Yahoo Mail.
2891000	2893000	And an email came up.
2893000	2896000	And it's very short.
2896000	2898000	And I would like to read it.
2898000	2900000	So this is you as a teenager.
2901000	2904000	I feel like this is your life or something.
2904000	2905000	This is embarrassing.
2905000	2906000	Go ahead.
2906000	2907000	I want to hear it.
2907000	2909000	This is you at one age, do you think?
2909000	2912000	2001, so six...
2912000	2913000	14 years ago.
2913000	2914000	Sixteen.
2914000	2916000	But six years after the special.
2916000	2917000	Yes.
2917000	2920000	So you weren't old enough to do anything
2920000	2923000	when 9-11 happened.
2923000	2925000	Hey, none of us were.
2925000	2926000	That's true.
2926000	2927000	Everything changed.
2927000	2928000	Everything changed.
2929000	2930000	That's true.
2930000	2932000	Good point, Camille.
2932000	2935000	We were all children before then.
2935000	2936000	We were all 16.
2936000	2939000	America was 16.
2939000	2940000	Yeah.
2940000	2942000	We were only 16.
2942000	2943000	Only 16.
2943000	2946000	All right.
2946000	2947000	Read it, read it.
2947000	2949000	Okay, all right.
2949000	2950000	What?
2950000	2951000	What the fuck?
2951000	2952000	Oh.
2952000	2954000	It's my heart playing.
2954000	2955000	Okay.
2955000	2956000	I'm going to read it.
2956000	2957000	I'm going to read it.
2958000	2961000	And I would only feel comfortable reading this on stage.
2962000	2964000	With Dana Carvey.
2964000	2967000	Subject Dana Carvey.
2967000	2968000	Subject Dana Carvey.
2968000	2969000	It's my fiance.
2969000	2970000	I'm not going to.
2970000	2971000	I'm just going to read.
2971000	2973000	I'm saying this to myself because I'm going to read through this
2973000	2975000	and I'm not going to editorialize
2975000	2977000	because I will feel compelled to do so
2977000	2980000	because I don't think I sound very smart.
2980000	2983000	Just present it and we'll judge it.
2983000	2985000	Okay, that's right.
2986000	2989000	That's a tradition as old as time.
2989000	2993000	Until this moment I haven't really felt that we were friends
2993000	2995000	but in this moment I feel like we were friends.
2995000	2996000	Just read it.
2996000	2997000	It's going to be very sweet.
2997000	2998000	I'm very excited.
2998000	2999000	Okay, it's very sweet.
2999000	3000000	I'm very excited.
3000000	3001000	Hello, older me.
3001000	3004000	Oh, God.
3004000	3006000	How are you?
3006000	3007000	I'm okay.
3007000	3008000	But I'm working.
3008000	3011000	I'm working thought things.
3011000	3013000	Can I judge you right now?
3013000	3015000	No, it's very short.
3015000	3018000	Here is personal and real thought.
3018000	3020000	To be an artist.
3020000	3023000	To be a comedic artist in all caps.
3023000	3028000	To mold thine artifice like clay
3028000	3033000	to the noble end of create joy.
3033000	3037000	To exhibit kindness and performance absent of personal need.
3037000	3040000	To be a clown, but not because you're scary or stupid,
3040000	3044000	but because you sacrifice your pride for the audience's joy.
3044000	3048000	To make people laugh in all caps.
3048000	3051000	This is what is important.
3051000	3053000	This is what I aspire to.
3053000	3055000	This is what I promise.
3055000	3056000	That's it.
3056000	3057000	And it's about Dana Carvey.
3057000	3058000	By the way, Dana Carvey.
3058000	3060000	It was about me.
3060000	3063000	Let's have a hand for Dana Carvey for coming out.
3063000	3071000	Please let him know when you see him on the sidewalk
3071000	3076000	that nothing bad was ever his fault.
3076000	3079000	All he ever wanted to do is make everyone happy.
3079000	3081000	That's all he ever wanted.
3081000	3084000	I think he succeeded.
3084000	3091000	So you, so that email, that email was about, you wrote that about Dana Carvey?
3091000	3092000	Yeah.
3092000	3095000	You must not have seen Wayne's World 2.
3095000	3099000	You know, he really fucked that movie up.
3099000	3102000	Now that he's gone, holy shit.
3102000	3105000	I blame it all on Garth.
3105000	3107000	Wayne's World P.U., right?
3107000	3110000	I just wish it was Wayne's World.
3110000	3113000	And there was, well it was Wayne's World.
3113000	3117000	But I mean, I just wanted more Wayne and less Garth.
3117000	3120000	Let's bring out Tenacious D.
3120000	3123000	I've got to say, honestly.
3123000	3127000	Jeff, you realize you got here late.
3127000	3129000	We started the show without you.
3129000	3131000	Not as far as I'm concerned.
3131000	3135000	As far as I'm concerned, the show started the moment I arrived.
3135000	3136000	Right?
3136000	3137000	Am I right?
3137000	3138000	That is not true.
3138000	3139000	Tenacious D was here.
3139000	3141000	Fuck Tenacious D, they left.
3141000	3145000	It's honestly very inspiring to hear him talk like that.
3145000	3148000	Being as, you know, done so much amazing stuff as he has.
3149000	3150000	He still has.
3150000	3152000	I fucking love that guy so much.
3152000	3155000	It's not, it's like, we had, you know, I don't know.
3155000	3156000	People come traipsing out here.
3156000	3157000	Wait, is there music playing?
3157000	3159000	Yeah, there's music playing.
3159000	3161000	Are you still at home, Jeff?
3161000	3163000	I had a great nap.
3163000	3165000	I, for real, I'm in such a euphoric state,
3165000	3168000	I thought that was just in my hat.
3168000	3169000	Fancy.
3169000	3170000	There is no...
3170000	3174000	You don't, like, it's a really big deal.
3174000	3176000	Yeah, it's huge for me.
3176000	3177000	I'm not articulating it.
3177000	3180000	I don't think, like Martin Short, if Martin Short were ever to come by...
3180000	3182000	Fuck Martin Short.
3182000	3184000	I think I would, I would kind of like...
3184000	3185000	No, not fuck him.
3185000	3188000	I would go into a seizure because I wouldn't really quite know how to handle it.
3188000	3193000	But, like, Dana Carvey represents, like, for me, my adolescent years,
3193000	3198000	represents the idea that we've all had, that all we want to do when we get up in the morning,
3198000	3204000	if there's those of us who decide, I just want to write, do makeup, make chairs,
3205000	3209000	build decks, design dump trucks, act, stunt coordinate, whatever.
3209000	3212000	I want to make other people happy.
3212000	3216000	It's hard to make so many people laugh without hurting anybody.
3216000	3217000	Right.
3217000	3219000	He's not a kumail, as they say in the bed.
3219000	3221000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3221000	3224000	Kumail makes people laugh, yes, but at what price?
3224000	3226000	He's funny.
3226000	3228000	It's a sharp sword.
3228000	3231000	It's the self-esteem of others is the price.
3231000	3233000	I take no prisoners.
3233000	3234000	Kumail's material is like...
3234000	3236000	My first album is called Fuck You.
3236000	3241000	I feel like when I'm laughing at Kumail, I'm laughing at, like...
3241000	3242000	I'm laughing at a fear.
3242000	3245000	I'm laughing at cripples when I'm laughing at Kumail.
3245000	3248000	I'm like, oh, I hope Kumail doesn't beat me up.
3248000	3250000	That's a big target for me.
3250000	3252000	I really take on the cripples.
3254000	3256000	Is cripples still PC?
3256000	3257000	No.
3257000	3258000	No.
3258000	3260000	Listen to the word.
3260000	3261000	Cripple?
3261000	3262000	Cripple?
3262000	3265000	I would say that you're tough but fair on cripples.
3265000	3266000	Hey.
3266000	3269000	Cripple just means your leg is hurt.
3269000	3271000	It does.
3271000	3273000	It does.
3273000	3275000	My best friend's in the audience.
3275000	3277000	She's a cripple, Kimber Hall.
3277000	3278000	She's a cripple?
3278000	3280000	Sure, her leg is hurt.
3280000	3283000	Well, she sprained her ankle partying.
3283000	3284000	She's a cripple.
3284000	3287000	Yeah, you've got to get on your knees and say you're a midget.
3287000	3289000	Oh, I see.
3289000	3291000	There's crutches on the side of the wall here.
3291000	3292000	Yeah.
3292000	3294000	No, but do people identify themselves as...
3294000	3295000	I'm sorry.
3295000	3296000	I don't think anybody's...
3296000	3297000	What would be the PC cripple?
3297000	3299000	Kimber, are you a cripple?
3299000	3300000	No.
3300000	3301000	She's not.
3301000	3305000	No one would call and be like, hey, do you have an elevator?
3305000	3306000	I'm a cripple.
3306000	3308000	Nobody would say that.
3308000	3309000	Do you have a wrap?
3309000	3311000	You would say I'm crippled.
3311000	3312000	No.
3312000	3314000	But even if your leg is hurt...
3314000	3315000	Kumail, Kumail.
3315000	3316000	Okay, here's my question.
3316000	3319000	If your leg is broken, you don't say I'm disabled.
3319000	3320000	You say I'm crippled.
3320000	3321000	No.
3321000	3322000	Not anymore.
3322000	3323000	All right, well...
3323000	3324000	It's like midget.
3324000	3327000	It was okay for a while, and then it got sidelined.
3327000	3328000	Like, you know...
3328000	3331000	It's like a cripple became disabled.
3331000	3332000	We all learned something.
3332000	3335000	That guy's leaving, but we know it's not because he's offended,
3335000	3336000	because he's walking out.
3336000	3338000	Okay, he's not limping away.
3338000	3339000	He's what?
3339000	3340000	He's abled.
3340000	3341000	He's able-bodied.
3341000	3343000	He's showing off.
3343000	3348000	Let's bring up professional linguist and physical ability expert
3348000	3349000	Spencer Crittenden.
3361000	3362000	Hey, guys.
3362000	3363000	Hey, Spencer.
3363000	3365000	You're probably the youngest guy up here.
3365000	3368000	What's your relationship with Dana Carvey?
3368000	3370000	I don't know him.
3370000	3372000	I mean, he was in the back room for a while.
3372000	3373000	I said a couple words to him.
3373000	3375000	Jesus.
3375000	3377000	Spencer, can you talk to me about...
3377000	3382000	I've felt, obviously, that I am mistaken
3382000	3385000	with my use of the word cripple.
3385000	3386000	Uh-huh.
3386000	3388000	But, like, can you explain to me
3388000	3391000	what is the right thing to just disabled and not...
3391000	3394000	Because people, I guess, call people who are in wheelchairs crippled,
3394000	3396000	and that's inappropriate.
3396000	3398000	Well, the best way is...
3398000	3400000	Yeah, it's across the line now.
3400000	3402000	I thought it was like a Charles Dickens thing.
3402000	3403000	Well, it was.
3403000	3405000	Yeah, it was a Charles Dickens thing,
3405000	3407000	but that was a long time ago.
3407000	3410000	If you live in 1809, you can call somebody crippled.
3410000	3413000	The Society for the Advancement of Handicapped People
3413000	3416000	is not the name for the society I'm trying to talk about.
3416000	3417000	Oh, shit.
3417000	3419000	But that society that I'm trying to talk about...
3419000	3420000	I would never...
3420000	3422000	I'm still trying to talk about it.
3422000	3426000	It used to be called, like, the International Society for Cripples,
3426000	3427000	and they changed it.
3427000	3428000	I see.
3428000	3430000	It definitely used to be like that.
3430000	3433000	I would never call a specially abled person crippled.
3433000	3434000	Differently abled.
3434000	3435000	Differently abled.
3435000	3436000	Yeah.
3437000	3438000	Okay.
3440000	3442000	I'm the last person to be put to task for this,
3442000	3443000	and I have...
3443000	3445000	Obviously, I've made myself a target, but I've saved a couple of things.
3445000	3447000	We keep moving the goalposts,
3447000	3451000	and I think we do it because we do it for the best reasons in the world.
3451000	3455000	We are all against, as human beings, we're all against dehumanization.
3455000	3459000	So the minute that we come up with a word that can sum up anybody
3459000	3462000	and people start to use it to refer to people,
3462000	3464000	like, as a group, as an object,
3464000	3466000	then we start to get uncomfortable.
3466000	3468000	So we move the goalpost, and we go, like,
3468000	3470000	let's shake things up.
3470000	3471000	Give it more words.
3471000	3472000	Absolutely. I'm an idiot.
3472000	3475000	I thought that cripple just referred to, like, when you can't move...
3475000	3476000	It is.
3476000	3478000	...temporarily than your cripple...
3478000	3479000	That's not the problem.
3479000	3481000	...but I would never call a person that is differently abled.
3481000	3482000	You're talking about fashion versus linguistics.
3482000	3484000	This is stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody.
3484000	3486000	The word retarded was fine for a long time.
3486000	3488000	It's also technically accurate.
3488000	3490000	It's just not the right one to use.
3490000	3494000	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
3494000	3496000	My grandma calls black people colored people.
3496000	3502000	To the extent that there is an institution, institutions move more slowly.
3502000	3506000	What are you going to do? Are we going to change the NAACP?
3506000	3510000	And I don't think there's anything wrong with the word colored.
3510000	3512000	But words take on...
3512000	3517000	It's just like they adhere to social customs.
3517000	3519000	And so my grandma looks out the window and she goes,
3519000	3522000	there's a colored fella on the corner and they...
3522000	3524000	She should know better.
3524000	3526000	She doesn't think she should do anything wrong.
3526000	3528000	You call people cripples.
3530000	3533000	You call people who are temporarily disabled cripples.
3533000	3536000	This is my biggest problem with policing language.
3536000	3539000	Because what have we learned from fucking policing language?
3539000	3544000	We keep changing our language and we keep not changing the class system.
3544000	3548000	We keep not changing the way we live our fucking life.
3548000	3550000	We keep not changing the way things are.
3550000	3552000	So my grandma looks out the window and goes,
3552000	3554000	there's a colored guy on the corner.
3554000	3556000	Oh, well let's make the word colored bad.
3556000	3558000	That'll change my fucking grandma.
3558000	3562000	No, it will not change my grandma.
3562000	3564000	Death will change my grandma.
3564000	3566000	Colored, colored...
3566000	3568000	Let's come up with a new name for death.
3568000	3570000	Let's kill your grandma.
3570000	3572000	She's a buried person.
3574000	3576000	And now it's over.
3576000	3577000	Problem solved.
3577000	3580000	But nothing other than that will solve the fucking problem.
3580000	3584000	And nothing other than violence has ever solved any fucking problem ever.
3584000	3589000	You don't change shit behind a fucking curtain.
3589000	3593000	If voting was powerful, it would be illegal.
3593000	3599000	If voting was powerful, it would be illegal.
3604000	3608000	But that being said, leave me out of your evolution.
3608000	3611000	I'm a millionaire and I'd like to...
3611000	3614000	I have a golden doodle and I'd like to die in peace.
3614000	3620000	You just earlier tonight told a story of kicking a homeless guy out of your parking lot.
3620000	3622000	I felt terrible.
3623000	3625000	Not terrible enough.
3626000	3628000	But that guy should have voted better.
3628000	3630000	Right? Right?
3630000	3634000	If he had voted right, he'd be allowed to sleep in a fucking parking lot.
3634000	3635000	Wrong.
3635000	3638000	No, you should have stopped that happening.
3638000	3640000	I couldn't fucking stop it.
3640000	3641000	Yeah, you could have.
3641000	3643000	Yeah, you could have. You should have stopped that.
3643000	3646000	How many fucking countries do we invade?
3646000	3648000	Don't change the subject.
3648000	3650000	We're not talking about invading countries.
3650000	3652000	We're talking about every four years.
3652000	3653000	No!
3653000	3656000	I'm going to vote for the guy with the red hat.
3656000	3658000	Oh, no! The guy with the blue hat.
3658000	3659000	Meanwhile...
3659000	3660000	You didn't stop.
3660000	3665000	Boom, boom, Middle East, boom, boom, boom, boom, bombs, bombs, bombs, bombs, boom.
3665000	3667000	Doesn't fucking matter.
3667000	3670000	It's called a fucking empire.
3670000	3672000	We play a game in this country.
3672000	3674000	We fucking hang out. We have a great time.
3674000	3676000	You could have made an impact.
3676000	3678000	You could have made a difference with that guy and you didn't.
3678000	3681000	Dana Carvey's really funny.
3681000	3682000	I fucking love that guy.
3682000	3685000	He never did anything wrong to anybody.
3685000	3687000	I'm going to go home tonight brokenhearted
3687000	3690000	because he's thinking about Wayne's World 2?
3690000	3691000	He's a fucking hero, man.
3691000	3693000	He never did anything wrong.
3693000	3697000	I heard that he stopped someone getting arrested in a parking lot once.
3697000	3698000	I bet he would.
3698000	3700000	I bet Dana Carvey would stop somebody.
3700000	3701000	Camille, how are you?
3701000	3706000	What's life like as a handsome Pakistani heir?
3707000	3708000	Pakistani heir?
3708000	3709000	Oh.
3709000	3710000	Oh, Pakistani.
3710000	3711000	I thought you...
3711000	3712000	Like I'm an heir to something.
3712000	3713000	Well, that's what I was thinking.
3713000	3717000	I was going to say handsome millionaire because in my mind,
3717000	3720000	when you do a lot of stuff, you equate that with a lot of money.
3720000	3721000	But that's rude.
3721000	3723000	Fucking government is bullshit.
3723000	3727000	It's a fucking fundamental lie.
3727000	3733000	Have you ever talked to anybody whose job is to tell other people what to do?
3733000	3737000	Fuck those people.
3737000	3740000	Like run your life through this acid test.
3740000	3742000	Talk to everybody that you've ever talked to.
3742000	3744000	What's your fucking job?
3744000	3747000	If it's only telling other people what to do, fuck you.
3747000	3748000	Fuck that person.
3748000	3749000	Government's bullshit.
3749000	3751000	Isn't that what you're doing now, though?
3751000	3752000	You're telling people...
3752000	3755000	No, I'm telling them to go run and flip over cop cars and burn stuff.
3755000	3757000	I'm saying leave me.
3757000	3760000	Leave my mansion alone.
3760000	3762000	I was on your side.
3762000	3766000	I have a golden doodle and I love them.
3766000	3767000	I'm 41.
3767000	3768000	Leave me out of it.
3768000	3770000	But you're 25.
3770000	3773000	Burn down the fucking White House.
3773000	3776000	Go do it.
3776000	3779000	Set shit on fire.
3779000	3780000	But leave me out of it.
3780000	3785000	Dan and I did an improv show last night.
3785000	3788000	The vibe is so different from when Dana Carvey was on stage.
3788000	3789000	Yeah.
3789000	3790000	It's become more yelly.
3790000	3791000	He's a people pleaser.
3791000	3793000	The vibe is so different.
3793000	3799000	Dana Carvey would be the poet laureate of the moon colony.
3799000	3802000	I would come out and I would go, no shoelaces.
3802000	3803000	Dan, where is this?
3803000	3805000	And then I would go, now the church lady.
3805000	3808000	And he'd come out and go, ah, special.
3808000	3812000	Dan, there's obviously this angry energy boiling up inside you.
3812000	3816000	Do you know where that's coming from right now?
3816000	3819000	Is this a couple's counseling stuff?
3819000	3822000	I'm excited.
3822000	3825000	Camille always comes to our sessions, by the way.
3825000	3826000	Yeah.
3826000	3830000	I kind of am like the hype man for their sessions.
3830000	3833000	I would actually be very into that.
3833000	3834000	That's right.
3834000	3835000	Yeah.
3835000	3836000	Tell me how you feel.
3836000	3837000	Yeah.
3837000	3838000	No.
3838000	3839000	Emote.
3839000	3842000	All right.
3842000	3846000	You were asking Camille how his career was going?
3846000	3847000	Oh, no.
3847000	3849000	Well, I did ask two questions.
3849000	3850000	It's like a government.
3850000	3853000	What did the government do?
3853000	3857000	I was wondering how Camille's travels were.
3857000	3864000	And then I also asked Dan where his anger was coming from.
3864000	3867000	I remember that.
3867000	3869000	Dan, I have a question for Jeff.
3869000	3870000	All right.
3870000	3873000	If we're moving on, but if we're not, let's stay in.
3873000	3874000	Let's move on.
3874000	3875000	Let's move on.
3875000	3879000	I saw, I'm bringing up a different thing.
3879000	3884000	I saw a Throwback Thursday picture that you posted of you at 11,
3884000	3888000	the most fuckable 11-year-old boy I've ever seen.
3888000	3892000	You were a gorgeous kid, and you're a gorgeous man.
3892000	3894000	But at 11, you look like that?
3894000	3896000	No wonder you're going around talking to strangers.
3896000	3898000	Face like a China plate.
3898000	3900000	Honestly, I don't mean that in a bad way.
3900000	3902000	My mom told me my nose looked like an eggplant,
3902000	3904000	and I didn't know what it was.
3904000	3909000	And so she took me to the store and pointed it out.
3909000	3912000	Marry the lead with your origin story.
3912000	3914000	So I don't want to talk to anybody.
3914000	3917000	But you, that picture, have you guys seen this picture?
3917000	3919000	Hashtag fuckers old child.
3919000	3921000	Eyes like sapphires.
3921000	3924000	His eyes are like sapphires.
3924000	3925000	Such confidence.
3925000	3931000	Cheekbones are like God sculpted a mountain for pedophiles.
3931000	3932000	You peeked in that catalog.
3932000	3934000	He does have amazing cheekbones.
3934000	3935000	Amazing cheekbones.
3935000	3938000	I mean, I don't want this to sound weird, but the way...
3938000	3939000	They still look great.
3939000	3940000	What happened to you?
3940000	3941000	What happened to you?
3941000	3944000	I fell apart, man.
3944000	3946000	When I was at that age, I was modeling.
3946000	3948000	I was in New York doing a play.
3948000	3949000	The King and I?
3949000	3950000	The King and I.
3950000	3951000	You were also modeling?
3951000	3952000	I didn't know this.
3952000	3954000	What are boy modeling poses?
3954000	3955000	The picture was...
3955000	3957000	And was it private?
3957000	3958000	He's doing it right now.
3958000	3961000	All right, Jeff is doing a cheer.
3961000	3963000	But this picture was modeling, right?
3963000	3964000	This was like a catalog?
3964000	3967000	It was a centerfold of New York Times Magazine.
3967000	3969000	You're for sure smizing.
3969000	3970000	Smizing?
3970000	3972000	Smiling with your eyes.
3972000	3973000	You're smizing.
3973000	3974000	And you're also...
3974000	3975000	You're smizing right now.
3975000	3977000	You're looking through the...
3977000	3978000	Smizing?
3978000	3982000	I think the very special thing about your child photography photos
3982000	3984000	is that they are very sexual
3984000	3986000	because it looks like you're looking through the camera
3986000	3987000	and you're like, yeah.
3987000	3988000	Definitely sexual.
3988000	3989000	Go for it.
3989000	3992000	Like there's some kind of like...
3992000	3993000	Supersexual child.
3993000	3994000	You're very sexual.
3994000	3997000	The answer is no, but talk to me about it.
3997000	3999000	That's a terrible thing to say.
3999000	4001000	You're an adult now, so it feels okay.
4001000	4003000	You're asking for it is what it's like.
4003000	4005000	I'm going to post a couple of other photos
4005000	4007000	on upcoming Thursdays.
4007000	4008000	I'm coming.
4008000	4018000	Spencer, please don't come on 11-year-old me.
4018000	4022000	I do think that when Spencer comes, that's how it sounds.
4022000	4023000	I'm coming.
4023000	4024000	All right.
4024000	4025000	I'm coming.
4025000	4026000	I'm coming.
4026000	4027000	That happens.
4027000	4029000	After Spencer has sex with a woman, he says...
4029000	4030000	That happened.
4030000	4031000	That happened.
4034000	4035000	That happened.
4035000	4037000	And then he goes to the fridge.
4037000	4039000	Yeah, it's weird because...
4039000	4040000	A critical hit.
4040000	4043000	Other than that, it's utter silence.
4043000	4044000	It's just...
4044000	4046000	That happened.
4046000	4047000	I'm coming.
4047000	4048000	Well, also...
4048000	4049000	That happened.
4049000	4052000	Maybe also when the girl does something a little inventive,
4052000	4053000	you're like...
4053000	4056000	And you do some sort of action with your hands,
4056000	4058000	which symbolizes rolling a dice, and you're like,
4058000	4059000	yeah, okay.
4059000	4060000	Not effective.
4062000	4064000	And when she's like, my parents are coming,
4064000	4066000	you're like, you're metagaming right now.
4067000	4069000	Your meta coming.
4069000	4071000	If she says, if I did this, would you like it?
4071000	4073000	And he goes, yeah, no.
4073000	4074000	Metagaming.
4074000	4075000	All right.
4075000	4078000	Enough about Spencer's sex.
4078000	4080000	Some of the times when I was just...
4080000	4082000	Had you already had sex at that age?
4082000	4083000	No.
4083000	4085000	I lost my virginity at 24 years old.
4085000	4086000	He was 10.
4086000	4087000	I was 24.
4087000	4088000	24?
4088000	4089000	I was 24.
4089000	4091000	Nerd alert!
4091000	4093000	It's not true.
4093000	4094000	It is.
4095000	4096000	What?
4096000	4097000	You mean like...
4097000	4100000	But did you lose it to 20 showgirls?
4100000	4102000	Like, what do you mean?
4102000	4104000	Are you talking about anal sex?
4104000	4105000	What do you mean?
4106000	4107000	What do you mean?
4107000	4110000	Okay, I had never put my penis inside a woman
4110000	4111000	until I was 24 years old.
4111000	4112000	Why?
4112000	4113000	Huh?
4113000	4114000	Why?
4114000	4115000	Not that that's a bad thing.
4115000	4118000	It's surprising just because he's a Casanova.
4118000	4119000	I was a late bloomer.
4119000	4122000	No, we saw you as an 11-year-old.
4123000	4127000	I look at that picture of you at eight
4127000	4128000	and I'm like,
4128000	4131000	I want to sit on that eight-year-old's face.
4135000	4136000	No, it's true.
4136000	4138000	I felt the same way.
4138000	4140000	We've all...
4140000	4143000	Jeff's sexuality at eight surpasses sexuality.
4143000	4145000	It's a...
4145000	4146000	I just...
4146000	4147000	I bet if that happened,
4147000	4148000	the judge would be like,
4148000	4150000	I kind of see that.
4151000	4153000	I get it.
4153000	4154000	I get it.
4155000	4158000	I see the victim in my chambers.
4160000	4163000	And could he please wear that windbreaker?
4164000	4165000	Also, hashtag rape culture.
4165000	4166000	Yay!
4166000	4167000	Harmontown.
4167000	4168000	Good night.
4170000	4171000	I'm very glad you weren't raped.
4171000	4172000	When I was...
4172000	4173000	Thank you.
4173000	4175000	I feel raped right now.
4175000	4177000	When I was four years old...
4177000	4178000	You asked for it.
4178000	4179000	Maybe...
4180000	4183000	I wouldn't have worn those eyelashes if I...
4183000	4185000	Yeah, the eyelashes.
4185000	4186000	The eyelashes.
4186000	4187000	You talked about the eyelashes.
4187000	4189000	By a round of applause,
4189000	4192000	who has seen Jeff Davis at eight years old?
4192000	4193000	I mean, Jeff!
4193000	4194000	It's 11.
4194000	4195000	11 it was.
4195000	4196000	This was 11.
4196000	4198000	The picture I saw was 11, so it's fine.
4198000	4200000	But I mean, do you hear...
4200000	4202000	Do you hear that applause?
4202000	4203000	And be honest,
4203000	4206000	who has seen Dan Harmon at eight years old?
4207000	4210000	I mean, there's a reason.
4215000	4216000	There's a reason.
4216000	4217000	It wasn't an actor.
4217000	4218000	I wasn't...
4218000	4219000	Yeah.
4219000	4220000	And ten years after that,
4220000	4222000	he was asking his mom if he was handsome.
4224000	4225000	When I was four,
4225000	4226000	I think I was not even quite...
4226000	4227000	Not quite four.
4227000	4229000	Like, maybe like almost four.
4229000	4231000	When I went to preschool,
4231000	4233000	and the first day of preschool,
4233000	4236000	it's the first time as a human being
4236000	4238000	I was around other kids that you didn't know.
4238000	4239000	You went to a building.
4239000	4240000	There was other kids.
4240000	4242000	And I remember it very vividly.
4242000	4244000	And when the class was over,
4244000	4246000	we took naps and we drew on chalkboard.
4246000	4247000	And then when it was over,
4247000	4248000	we all ran out.
4248000	4250000	When the day was over,
4250000	4251000	all the parents were outside,
4251000	4253000	and there was a big grass lawn,
4253000	4254000	and all the kids,
4254000	4256000	we all ran out like bats coming out of a cave
4256000	4257000	because we were so wound up
4257000	4260000	from being around other human beings our age.
4260000	4261000	You had to have a popsicle.
4261000	4263000	And I ran around in a circle,
4263000	4264000	and I ran up to this girl...
4264000	4265000	Jesus Christ, that's disgusting.
4265000	4266000	I ran up to this girl,
4266000	4268000	Patricia Beth Hayes,
4268000	4269000	and she was a little blonde girl,
4269000	4270000	four years old.
4270000	4271000	I just went up to her,
4271000	4272000	and I just fucking Clark Gable there,
4272000	4273000	grabbed her by the back of her head,
4273000	4275000	leaned her over and kissed her,
4275000	4277000	like, gone with the wind style,
4277000	4279000	and then pushed her down in the grass
4279000	4280000	and ran off.
4282000	4285000	And that's kind of been my M.O. since then.
4285000	4286000	That's been...
4286000	4288000	That's your dating history.
4288000	4289000	Yeah, it really is.
4290000	4291000	Definitely not romantic.
4291000	4294000	So, you can insert 20 years
4294000	4296000	between the kissing and the pushing down,
4296000	4298000	but that's basically what we're all doing.
4300000	4302000	I got a big laugh out of the adults,
4302000	4303000	and then when the king and I started,
4303000	4304000	when I was nine,
4304000	4305000	when I got into the king and I...
4305000	4307000	You've been doing that for years, you did that?
4307000	4309000	I did it from nine through 11.
4309000	4310000	At the age of nine,
4310000	4312000	when I was close, I was 11 years old.
4312000	4315000	And I did it at the Pantages here in L.A.
4315000	4316000	when I was nine.
4316000	4318000	And there were seven girls
4318000	4321000	that were the kids in the show.
4321000	4324000	Seven Asian girls that were the king's daughters.
4324000	4326000	And there were seven Asian boys that were the king's sons.
4326000	4328000	And then we went on tour.
4328000	4330000	Wait, where did you fall into that?
4330000	4331000	He was an Asian kid.
4331000	4334000	There's one white kid in the king and I,
4334000	4335000	the son of Anna.
4335000	4338000	Oh, you're the one white kid too, huh?
4338000	4340000	Everything's so easy for Jeff.
4343000	4344000	Did you feel that?
4344000	4346000	Did you know you were the only white kid?
4346000	4349000	You're a kid and we weren't racist.
4349000	4352000	Also, my understudy was white.
4352000	4355000	And I went through seven understudies in that year and a half.
4355000	4359000	Because it was hard to keep the white kid that had to put on
4359000	4362000	really bad Asian makeup every night.
4362000	4364000	They made him look orange, really.
4364000	4366000	And then slanty eye makeup and shit.
4366000	4367000	It was really shitty.
4367000	4370000	Wait, don't move on from this.
4370000	4371000	We're still here.
4371000	4372000	But you were playing a white kid.
4372000	4373000	Yes.
4373000	4375000	But your understudy had to...
4375000	4376000	Play an Asian kid.
4376000	4377000	Why?
4377000	4379000	Because they had a free kid on the set.
4379000	4381000	Also, they would just be like,
4381000	4383000	all right, so he could be anybody.
4383000	4385000	Ricky, Mickey, Rooney.
4385000	4389000	And also, the makeup, there was no making any of these kids.
4389000	4392000	Did you have to be white for a narrative reason?
4392000	4396000	The story of the king and I is a British woman goes to Siam,
4396000	4399000	what is now Thailand, to instruct the king of Siam
4399000	4402000	in modern, western ways.
4402000	4405000	It's like Apocalypse Now, the story, right?
4405000	4407000	No.
4407000	4410000	It's like the boring dinner scene in Apocalypse Now.
4410000	4412000	If you just took the shitty parts of Apocalypse Now.
4412000	4413000	In Redux, yeah.
4413000	4414000	There's a teacher.
4414000	4415000	So we would go from town to town.
4415000	4420000	And the kids would range from like six and seven years old up to 13.
4420000	4424000	And so we traveled with seven kids.
4424000	4428000	And we would go to town to be seven new girls every city we went to.
4428000	4429000	Were any of them crippled?
4429000	4430000	Huh?
4431000	4432000	Don't derail.
4432000	4434000	So we go to town.
4434000	4436000	So the girls wouldn't travel with you but the boys wouldn't?
4436000	4437000	Don't derail.
4437000	4438000	No, I'm asking.
4438000	4441000	You are not allowed to tell people to do something you do constantly.
4441000	4442000	Stop derailing.
4442000	4443000	I'm the derail master.
4443000	4444000	Seven kids traveled.
4444000	4445000	Three of them were boys.
4445000	4447000	Four of them were girls.
4447000	4449000	And then we would get like 14 new kids,
4449000	4451000	half of which were boys and girls.
4451000	4453000	So I would have a dressing room.
4453000	4455000	And there would be little girls.
4455000	4457000	And we would just play Truth or Dare.
4457000	4458000	We invented the game.
4458000	4459000	No one had taught us this.
4459000	4460000	They invented the game.
4460000	4461000	Jeff, you did not invent the game.
4461000	4462000	You invented the game.
4462000	4463000	In your head, your life is for...
4463000	4464000	This makes sense.
4464000	4465000	Yeah, you think you're Forrest Gump.
4465000	4466000	No, but here's the thing.
4466000	4469000	And then the world said thank you for the game.
4469000	4471000	Nobody taught us how to play Truth or Dare,
4471000	4473000	but we played a game that is absolutely Truth or Dare
4473000	4475000	without anyone having taught us this.
4475000	4477000	Do you feel like you invented that game?
4477000	4478000	Well, for us, we did.
4478000	4479000	Because we didn't have...
4479000	4480000	That's fine.
4480000	4481000	But for the world, you did.
4481000	4484000	So you guys called it Deebl or Derbal.
4484000	4485000	Aaron, a guy's walking out on crutches.
4485000	4487000	You want to say anything?
4487000	4491000	Why so crippled?
4491000	4492000	You're good.
4492000	4493000	Like, you do what you want, man.
4493000	4494000	You don't have to stay here.
4494000	4495000	Are you going to the bathroom?
4495000	4497000	I was just going to get some chips.
4497000	4499000	Did you?
4499000	4500000	He's going to get some chips.
4500000	4501000	You hurt your leg.
4501000	4503000	Can I guess you hurt your leg, skateboarding?
4503000	4504000	I ran into a stair.
4504000	4506000	You ran into a stair.
4506000	4507000	So he's a cripple,
4507000	4509000	because it's a temporary thing.
4509000	4510000	We really have to move on.
4510000	4513000	Aaron, that's not how it works at all.
4513000	4514000	I am.
4514000	4515000	That's not how it works.
4516000	4517000	I want to go back.
4517000	4518000	I was talking to somebody...
4518000	4519000	Somebody get this guy some money.
4519000	4520000	I was talking to somebody else.
4520000	4521000	I take that back.
4521000	4523000	I don't want to be the person behind that fight.
4523000	4524000	Come on.
4524000	4525000	Jeff's talking about fucking four-year-olds.
4525000	4527000	As a kid, we would make out.
4527000	4530000	Now, I was in a kissing bandit all throughout my life.
4530000	4531000	I kissed everybody.
4531000	4532000	I was like...
4532000	4534000	And then I just never had sex until I was 24.
4534000	4538000	However, when I was four years old in preschool...
4538000	4540000	All right, take it easy.
4540000	4543000	He got the chips that he said he was going to get.
4543000	4545000	And now he's opening them, and...
4545000	4546000	Well, it's expected.
4546000	4547000	It's so loud.
4547000	4550000	First of all, how did he get the chips so fast?
4550000	4551000	He's crippled.
4551000	4552000	Yeah.
4552000	4553000	No, don't call him a cripple.
4553000	4555000	Those are the loudest chips I've ever heard.
4555000	4557000	No, that's the antiquated bread.
4557000	4558000	You're surprised.
4558000	4561000	There's a line for chips just for handicapped people.
4561000	4562000	It's way closer.
4562000	4564000	Did the mic pick that up?
4564000	4566000	I realized I never said that out loud.
4566000	4568000	I thought that that was just because of it.
4568000	4569000	Jeff, I'm so sorry.
4569000	4570000	Please continue the story.
4570000	4572000	You just interrupted the thing for the things.
4572000	4573000	The chips.
4573000	4574000	Jalapeno.
4574000	4576000	Yeah, those are the best.
4576000	4577000	Wait, jalapeno?
4577000	4579000	No more for this kid.
4579000	4580000	This kid...
4580000	4582000	This kid, he lived his life.
4582000	4583000	He hurt his leg.
4583000	4584000	You ran into it.
4584000	4585000	He opened chips loudly.
4585000	4586000	You ran into a stare?
4586000	4587000	No more attention for him.
4587000	4589000	That's what someone says when they've been abused.
4589000	4592000	Someone says, oh, I fell into a door.
4592000	4594000	You ran into a stare?
4594000	4595000	What kind of bullshit story is that?
4595000	4598000	I don't think abusers hit people's feet.
4598000	4600000	You know?
4601000	4602000	I worked probably good.
4602000	4604000	Do you think that you didn't think the stare was there
4604000	4607000	and you're like, this is just a hallway?
4607000	4609000	I mean, you thought it was a hallway
4609000	4610000	and you just ran into the hallway,
4610000	4612000	and then you're like, oh, no, this goes up.
4612000	4613000	Like, what?
4613000	4615000	It was like Looney Tunes.
4615000	4618000	Someone drew a floor on the stairs
4618000	4620000	and he just ran into it.
4620000	4623000	But I mean, really, when you say I ran into a stare,
4623000	4625000	that's not acceptable information.
4625000	4627000	I'm sure this doctor was like, nah.
4627000	4628000	I think it's fine.
4628000	4631000	Otherwise, next week, there's going to be eight people
4631000	4633000	with crutches opening chip bags really loudly.
4633000	4635000	And they're going to be like, what about me?
4635000	4636000	Can I be famous?
4636000	4637000	I don't think that'll happen.
4637000	4640000	OK, so you invented truth or dare.
4640000	4641000	You were killing your own kids.
4641000	4645000	My friend, the guy that played the prince, the Asian,
4645000	4648000	there's two kid leads in The King and I.
4648000	4650000	Jesus Christ, he's eating them loud, too.
4650000	4652000	Did you hear that fucking crunch?
4652000	4655000	Dan, you're not allowed to say you can't talk about it anymore.
4655000	4656000	It's not my fault.
4656000	4657000	And then put your attention back.
4657000	4658000	It's my fault.
4658000	4661000	Did you hear that fucking crunch on this guy?
4661000	4662000	Yes.
4662000	4664000	Is there a mic on him?
4664000	4666000	It's like a Pringles commercial.
4666000	4668000	It's so loud.
4668000	4670000	What flavor is that?
4670000	4671000	They're jalapeno.
4671000	4672000	It's so loud.
4672000	4673000	I don't want to derail the whole thing.
4673000	4675000	Are they as loud as yelling on a microphone?
4675000	4678000	This man with the crutches looks like he was a very handsome child.
4678000	4680000	He still is.
4680000	4682000	He still is a handsome child.
4682000	4686000	Yeah, he's a handsome child.
4686000	4689000	Everybody be quiet and just eat one more chip.
4689000	4692000	Everybody be dead quiet.
4695000	4696000	That's fucking loud.
4696000	4697000	They're potato chips.
4697000	4699000	Can you hear that in America?
4699000	4701000	In the podcast audience?
4701000	4702000	Yeah.
4702000	4704000	He has an amplifier in your mouth.
4704000	4705000	What's going on?
4705000	4708000	He was doing the perfect shape for projecting sound out.
4708000	4710000	He's a Foley artist.
4710000	4713000	He's a Foley artist.
4713000	4715000	All right, so I want to go back to this.
4715000	4716000	Okay, so truth or dare?
4716000	4718000	You've invented truth or dare?
4718000	4721000	My friend, Doug, the other kid...
4721000	4722000	He also...
4722000	4724000	Fucking Doug Clay, fuck guy.
4724000	4725000	He was so great.
4725000	4726000	He was like...
4726000	4727000	I was 11.
4727000	4728000	He was 13.
4728000	4730000	And he jerked off in front of us.
4730000	4731000	Nice.
4732000	4733000	Great story.
4733000	4734000	All right, let's do D&D.
4734000	4737000	All right, well, thanks for coming tonight, folks.
4737000	4739000	I hope you enjoyed Jana Cardi.
4739000	4742000	But we were kids...
4742000	4743000	But hang on.
4743000	4744000	When I was four years old...
4744000	4745000	No, no, no.
4745000	4746000	Finish the jerk-off story.
4746000	4747000	Hang on, no, no.
4747000	4748000	That's the beginning of it.
4748000	4749000	How old were you?
4749000	4750000	I was 11.
4750000	4751000	He's just talked about this before.
4751000	4752000	Hang on.
4752000	4754000	When I was 9, 10, 11 years old...
4754000	4755000	He needs to get it out.
4755000	4756000	We would be...
4756000	4757000	We had dressing rooms and we would all...
4757000	4760000	The way the truth or dare started was...
4760000	4762000	I had, like, a hauls like mental illness.
4762000	4765000	You were like, what shall we do with our time?
4765000	4768000	I've got an idea.
4768000	4769000	I had a cough drop.
4769000	4771000	We just knew there were boys and there were girls.
4771000	4772000	And then we all knew.
4772000	4773000	We didn't know what was going on.
4773000	4775000	We just knew that something must happen.
4775000	4776000	That's what I said.
4776000	4777000	Yeah.
4777000	4782000	So I would take a cough drop and Kathy or Yvette,
4782000	4783000	the girls that were in the show,
4783000	4785000	they were 9 years old like I was.
4785000	4787000	We would lay on top of each other
4787000	4790000	and then we would pass a cough drop from one mouth to the other.
4790000	4791000	Jesus Christ.
4791000	4792000	Yeah.
4792000	4795000	It's sexy except these names are, like, from a math textbook.
4795000	4797000	So the...
4797000	4799000	You don't know any Yvette's really.
4799000	4800000	But you read...
4800000	4803000	Yvette has an idea about the...
4803000	4804000	How about Patria?
4804000	4806000	Patria Beth with a fucking great name.
4806000	4808000	But Yvette was, oh, my God.
4808000	4809000	So cute.
4809000	4813000	Oh, she could suck a cough drop.
4813000	4816000	She could suck a menthol off a lozenge.
4816000	4825000	So our tutor, who was this very beautiful woman named Bridget,
4825000	4827000	she told our parents,
4827000	4829000	we have to give these kids sex education.
4829000	4832000	We were all, like, the average age was 9 years old.
4832000	4834000	You guys are just going around laying on each other.
4834000	4838000	They kept walking into a room and we would just be on top of each other making out.
4838000	4839000	Yeah, it's like frog DNA.
4839000	4842000	Like, they found a way.
4842000	4844000	We didn't tell them.
4844000	4845000	So we had to get sex ed.
4845000	4846000	We didn't know what sex was.
4846000	4848000	Then later on when we were, like, in Washington, D.C.,
4848000	4850000	like, the tour was kind of ending when I was about 11,
4850000	4854000	we found a bunch of porn mags under a bed in a hotel room.
4854000	4856000	And we were like, oh, fuck.
4857000	4860000	We've been doing this wrong the whole time.
4860000	4861000	Cough drops.
4861000	4864000	We have tiny dicks.
4864000	4867000	But as a kid, no one instructs you how to play truth or dare.
4867000	4869000	So then we would dare people to do stuff.
4869000	4872000	I think it's an organic thing that children create on their own
4872000	4873000	without any instruction.
4873000	4878000	When I was 4 years old, we played doctor and I...
4878000	4879000	Jesus.
4879000	4880000	Guess what?
4880000	4882000	Someone is a big fan of 4-year-olds.
4882000	4884000	I was laughing hysterically.
4885000	4890000	Our teacher, Mrs. Newhouse, would leave the preschool room
4890000	4892000	and she had a giant oak desk.
4892000	4894000	And I would take, like...
4894000	4899000	Me and Jeffrey and Craig, we would take a girl...
4899000	4900000	And everybody would watch.
4900000	4901000	She was all around.
4901000	4902000	And she would take her clothes off.
4902000	4903000	She would take her clothes off.
4903000	4904000	Everyone would watch.
4904000	4905000	She would take her clothes...
4905000	4906000	You guys are 4?
4906000	4907000	And we played doctor.
4907000	4908000	So everybody was watching.
4908000	4910000	There were nurses and there were other doctors.
4910000	4912000	And so the girl would take her clothes off
4912000	4914000	and I would touch her boobs and I would touch her pussy
4914000	4915000	and I would touch everything.
4915000	4916000	Does it hurt here?
4916000	4917000	And I was the doctor.
4917000	4918000	We did 4.
4918000	4920000	When you say I would touch her pussy...
4920000	4922000	Yeah, these are all doctor terms.
4922000	4925000	I mean, you...
4925000	4926000	Playing doctor.
4926000	4927000	Playing doctor.
4927000	4929000	He's not nearly old enough to be a doctor.
4929000	4931000	When you would touch with a medical community,
4931000	4932000	it refers to it as a pussy.
4932000	4933000	But it wasn't...
4933000	4935000	Was it like a...
4935000	4937000	Or was it a...
4937000	4938000	Or was it a...
4938000	4939000	Did you push it?
4939000	4941000	Did you put your hand and then push pressure?
4941000	4943000	Like when they check for the gallbladder?
4943000	4944000	I would say...
4944000	4946000	I would touch her stomach and go,
4946000	4947000	does it hurt here?
4947000	4948000	We're playing.
4948000	4949000	It's 4 years old.
4949000	4950000	Does it hurt here?
4950000	4951000	Shut the fuck up.
4951000	4953000	Finish the story.
4953000	4955000	Jesus Christ.
4955000	4956000	It's not a long story.
4956000	4958000	If I could just be a naked girl and I would go,
4958000	4959000	does it hurt here?
4959000	4960000	Do we just lightly touch people?
4960000	4962000	And it wasn't sexy.
4962000	4963000	We just knew that there was...
4963000	4964000	Boys and girls were different
4964000	4966000	and we're just old enough to recognize those differences.
4966000	4969000	So we invented for us, playing doctor.
4969000	4971000	That's a thing that kids do.
4971000	4973000	It's two games now.
4973000	4975000	Well, I can understand.
4975000	4977000	I invented Four Corners.
4977000	4979000	I don't know if you've all played that.
4979000	4981000	I don't know Four Corners.
4981000	4982000	I was the first one to say,
4982000	4984000	see you later alligator.
4984000	4988000	My brother told me he invented peanut butter and jelly.
4988000	4991000	He told me he fucking invented it.
4991000	4994000	And I knew he was lying.
4994000	4996000	And had no choice but to answer.
4996000	4997000	And then after I mastered peanut butter,
4997000	4999000	I moved on to fruits.
4999000	5001000	So the teacher would walk back in the room
5001000	5003000	and there would be Gloria naked under the desk
5003000	5006000	and me and Jeffrey, Kim and Craig were probably just like...
5006000	5008000	Was it always Gloria or different ones?
5008000	5009000	It was different every time.
5009000	5010000	Fuck you.
5010000	5011000	Fuck you.
5011000	5012000	Fuck you.
5012000	5013000	No, no, no.
5013000	5014000	Not fucked up.
5014000	5015000	No, fuck him.
5015000	5020000	He got more fucking trim in third grade.
5020000	5021000	What the fuck was it?
5021000	5022000	1969.
5022000	5026000	He had trim that erases me saying cripple.
5026000	5027000	Trim.
5027000	5028000	I'm joking.
5028000	5029000	Trim.
5029000	5030000	Really?
5030000	5033000	You guys are going to boo the use of the word trim?
5033000	5035000	Well, it's not a desirable of that age.
5035000	5036000	What is it?
5036000	5037000	It's a four-year-old.
5037000	5038000	You can't do it.
5038000	5039000	Trim.
5039000	5042000	Jeff, you can pass on this question,
5042000	5045000	but you said you lost your virginity at 24.
5045000	5046000	Yes.
5046000	5048000	We're hearing about all these sexual experiences that you had
5048000	5049000	and you don't have to answer this,
5049000	5052000	but in a few sentences,
5052000	5055000	could you quantify why maybe you lost your virginity at 24
5055000	5060000	because obviously you're a very sexy man.
5060000	5063000	Yes, I can't tell.
5063000	5064000	That was a tepid response.
5064000	5065000	Yeah, really.
5065000	5066000	It was a little late.
5066000	5067000	It was a little late.
5067000	5069000	I think it was a response to me, not to Jeff, but...
5069000	5073000	I look back on junior high and high school as times when,
5073000	5077000	if I knew what was going on and if I could have read the signal...
5077000	5079000	You were too busy inventing games.
5079000	5082000	Well, you were Christian.
5082000	5083000	Weren't you Christian older?
5083000	5086000	First, it was me being late bloomer and being terrified of girls.
5086000	5089000	And also, there was a girl I dated when I was a sophomore in high school.
5089000	5091000	No, I was a freshman. She was a sophomore.
5091000	5093000	Well, you fuck you.
5093000	5095000	That's what I'm saying, and everyone booed me
5095000	5097000	because I used the wrong word, but fuck you.
5097000	5099000	Yeah, use that trim to refer to a four-year-old.
5099000	5100000	They should be here.
5100000	5102000	All right, okay. I misstepped. I made a misstep.
5102000	5103000	But I'm still a good guy.
5103000	5105000	Yeah, you're a good guy.
5105000	5106000	It's getting more action.
5106000	5107000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5107000	5108000	A word, action?
5108000	5110000	No, we're all on your side.
5110000	5112000	I never kissed her. Her name was Ursula.
5112000	5114000	Oh, by the way.
5114000	5116000	She just dated math textbooks.
5116000	5119000	She was a cheerleader, and she was very beautiful.
5119000	5120000	She had five apples.
5120000	5122000	I was terrified of her.
5126000	5128000	Math textbook Joe.
5130000	5133000	She also wanted to know how long a train would take to get there.
5133000	5135000	We never even kissed.
5135000	5137000	I had girlfriends that I never kissed because I thought...
5137000	5140000	My brother's friends, who were two years older than me,
5141000	5144000	said, then I, was this guy...
5144000	5146000	What was his name? Fucking asshole. Really tall.
5146000	5148000	It was probably Jamal.
5148000	5149000	His name was Kevin.
5149000	5151000	Okay. Kevin's also a text lead.
5151000	5152000	He comes up and he goes like,
5152000	5154000	He's like, so you fucking Ursula?
5154000	5156000	I'm like, no, sir.
5156000	5159000	Like, the very idea.
5159000	5163000	I thought that to have sex with girls would be the highest insult.
5163000	5165000	That they wouldn't want to...
5165000	5167000	It's only... I thought as a kid,
5167000	5169000	that's only something that guys wanted to do to girls.
5169000	5170000	And girls are like, no.
5170000	5172000	And they're like, that's really rude.
5172000	5173000	Like, no.
5173000	5175000	So I was really, really...
5175000	5176000	It is rude.
5176000	5177000	Then in college...
5177000	5179000	I can't think of anything rude you could do to a child.
5179000	5181000	It's rude to have sex with a woman.
5181000	5182000	It is rude.
5183000	5185000	I apologize every time.
5185000	5187000	It really is.
5187000	5188000	It's rude.
5188000	5191000	That shouldn't happen.
5191000	5193000	I go like, thank you.
5193000	5194000	Thank you very much.
5194000	5196000	Thank you and sorry.
5196000	5198000	I absolutely do feel that way.
5198000	5201000	I get done and I go, thank you.
5201000	5203000	Sorry, sorry about that.
5203000	5206000	Yeah, I bow out and I walk backwards out of the room.
5206000	5208000	I go and get a towel.
5208000	5212000	There's a visualization of your animal person.
5212000	5213000	So sorry.
5213000	5215000	We were ashamed of ourselves.
5215000	5218000	Then I went through a born again Christian phase.
5218000	5219000	How long did you stay Ursula?
5219000	5221000	For 45 minutes.
5221000	5222000	Like, no time at all.
5222000	5223000	Did she steal your voice?
5223000	5225000	There's no clock behind you.
5225000	5227000	What time is it?
5228000	5229000	9 40.
5229000	5231000	We're overdue for D&D.
5231000	5233000	We're going to start D&D.
5233000	5234000	Sorry.
5234000	5236000	Thank you for all of that.
5236000	5240000	The show brought to you by four year old trim.
5240000	5242000	I'm sorry I used the word trim.
5242000	5243000	It's a gross word.
5243000	5244000	Trim.
5244000	5245000	Trim.
5245000	5246000	That's my worst.
5246000	5248000	No, I'm sorry I used the word.
5248000	5250000	And I want to apologize.
5250000	5253000	I'm part of Camille for using the C word.
5253000	5255000	I didn't use color.
5255000	5256000	Colored?
5256000	5257000	We'll see.
5257000	5258000	Colored.
5258000	5261000	My bit was that you said that word.
5261000	5264000	There's a Tylenol with codeine.
5264000	5266000	That just got mixed in there.
5266000	5267000	It did.
5267000	5271000	But Spencer announced that he would never return in the last session, right?
5271000	5272000	He disappeared.
5272000	5274000	He used his amulet of Shannon.
5274000	5278000	So let's hear it for Spencer as Tylenol with codeine in the last episode.
5278000	5279000	Amazing.
5279000	5280000	That was good.
5280000	5282000	The best thing ever.
5282000	5283000	Thank you.
5283000	5284000	Give me some quirks.
5284000	5285000	I don't want to get into it.
5285000	5287000	You were born again for how long?
5287000	5288000	Real quick.
5288000	5289000	Just tell me the year end.
5289000	5290000	We won't talk about it.
5290000	5291000	Three, four years.
5291000	5292000	In your teen years?
5292000	5293000	Then I was like...
5293000	5294000	I was your family into it?
5294000	5296000	I had never had sex so I became abstinent.
5296000	5301000	But I was abstaining from something that I accidentally abstained from a long time.
5301000	5305000	And then I would date girls and they were like, you really like foreplay.
5305000	5307000	I was like, that's all you're going to get.
5307000	5310000	So says Jesus.
5310000	5313000	Jesus says dry humping is okay.
5313000	5318000	I was absent and in a similar program called True Love Waits.
5318000	5319000	And my excuse...
5319000	5321000	I never did any foreplay.
5321000	5322000	True Love Waits.
5322000	5324000	You were in a thing called True Love Waits?
5324000	5325000	Yeah.
5325000	5327000	And look what she waited for.
5327000	5328000	Amazing.
5328000	5330000	True Love's going to be so happy.
5330000	5334000	The program that called True Love Waiting pays off.
5334000	5337000	Yeah, True Love should have waited a little bit longer.
5337000	5341000	Yeah, True Love's going to hell down.
5341000	5342000	I'm so sorry.
5342000	5343000	I'm so sorry.
5343000	5344000	I'm so sorry.
5344000	5346000	I'm so sorry.
5346000	5347000	Thank you.
5347000	5348000	Thank you.
5348000	5350000	All right, Spencer, would you take us away?
5350000	5351000	Yeah, sorry.
5351000	5354000	Oh, boy.
5354000	5362000	When we last met, our heroes had just fended off flaming goblins and gem bugs in the purple
5362000	5363000	canyons.
5363000	5370000	After looting a power stone, the robot baby was activated, who the game gang dubbed Logi
5370000	5372340	due to its damaged logic core.
5372340	5377040	The baby spoke of a place that it was designed to locate, although it was not designed to
5377040	5379680	locate it very effectively.
5379680	5385160	And the damaged logic core prevented it from recalling what or where it was looking for.
5385160	5391160	But as they spoke, Sharpie smelled a funky sack and realized his bag was ablaze.
5391160	5396560	He emptied its contents, a flaming goblin named Justin, and after some interrogation
5396560	5402240	determined that the robot's power core was from the Air City, home of technological
5402240	5404920	wonders and flying machines.
5404920	5411680	The gang was unsure of how to proceed, but Justin suggested they get some arrow hawks.
5411680	5417240	Then Tylenol with Codeine piped up and disappeared right afterwards.
5417240	5422880	So it was off to Rosebrook, a nearby village susceptible to pillage, to plan their next
5422880	5423880	move.
5423880	5427540	Could our heroes truly reach the Air City?
5427540	5429440	Where was the said city?
5429440	5431080	The Air City?
5431080	5433880	And what dangers might Rosebrook hold?
5433880	5436080	And what of the robot baby?
5436080	5443640	Find out now, on an all new Harmon Town time.
5443640	5444640	That's good shit Spencer.
5444640	5445640	So I know-
5445640	5446640	That was very good.
5446640	5450080	It occurred to me while I was writing it that it's very hard to summarize all the weird
5450080	5451080	shit that happened.
5451080	5452080	Yeah.
5452080	5453080	Well we don't-
5453080	5457840	Oh I know, I mean it's not for you guys, it's for- I don't know who it's for to be
5457840	5458840	honest.
5458840	5459840	Yeah.
5459840	5460840	Because they could rewind and listen to it.
5460840	5463120	Oh no, they know what's going on, chances are.
5463120	5465080	They know so much better than us.
5465080	5466080	Yeah.
5466080	5468200	And then they're like, why don't you use the rope you're holding?
5468200	5469200	I feel like I just-
5469200	5470200	I'm not holding a rope, I'm trying.
5470200	5471200	Okay so the-
5471200	5472200	Then you should listen to it.
5472200	5474320	The town is called Rosebook, Rosebrook.
5474320	5477800	I think I called it Rosebook, let's just call it Rosebook in the last episode.
5477800	5480320	Okay, so are we in a Rosebrook or are we on our way to Rosebrook?
5480320	5481800	You're on the way to Rosebrook.
5481800	5483320	Well we've got like outside of-
5483320	5486680	Yeah there's this, you saw the city, you could see it.
5486680	5488840	You can see it far off.
5488840	5491240	You're right by a town that says Rosebook.
5491240	5493160	Because the baby's walking with us?
5493160	5494160	Yeah, yeah he's-
5494160	5495160	He walks by himself?
5495160	5497440	Well I don't know, I think someone was carrying him.
5497440	5498440	Oh okay.
5498440	5499440	I'll carry him.
5499440	5500440	Oh I have the baby.
5500440	5503000	I think my- is my mic working still?
5503000	5505760	Yeah, I just thought it different.
5505760	5507480	Yeah it did for a bit.
5507480	5509000	It did for a bit, it's good now.
5509000	5510000	Okay.
5510320	5511560	What is happening?
5511560	5513520	We're trying to solve the problem.
5513520	5515560	I have the baby, the baby's mine.
5515560	5516560	Pardon.
5516560	5519560	Tenacious D was here?
5519560	5522440	Fucking Soupy Sales came out.
5522440	5523440	What?
5523440	5524440	Yeah.
5524440	5525440	Soupy Sales.
5525440	5526440	Did he-
5526440	5527440	D Martin?
5527440	5528440	Did he?
5528440	5531800	We had, you weren't here, you slept in.
5531800	5533800	I did, I had a great nap.
5533800	5539480	So you're carrying the baby, I'm going to walk alongside you in case you get tired.
5539480	5540480	Okay, for sure.
5540480	5543040	Give her the baby, Krista Berg, she wants to hold the baby.
5543040	5545040	I mean you and I are of the same mindset.
5545040	5548120	Krista Berg, if you and I can have an aside.
5548120	5549120	Sure.
5549120	5550120	Shit.
5550120	5556120	I, up until this point, have been chaotic good, has been my scuba-doo?
5556120	5557120	Mantra?
5557120	5558120	Affiliation, my-
5558120	5559120	Alignment.
5559120	5560120	Alignment.
5560120	5561120	Scuba-doo.
5561120	5562120	Also known as scuba-doo.
5562120	5563120	I like that.
5563120	5565800	I'm feeling chaotic bad.
5565800	5568920	Oh, then you don't- I'm not going to give you the baby.
5568920	5573440	No, no, no, I don't want to hurt the baby, I just want to be selfish and do things that
5573440	5574440	are-
5574440	5576520	These are not good arguments to get the baby.
5576520	5577520	Okay.
5577520	5578520	Well-
5578520	5581680	I'm watching this conversation-
5581680	5582680	No, you're not.
5582680	5583680	You can't hear it.
5583680	5584680	From a bush and I'm jerking off.
5584680	5585680	Okay?
5585680	5586680	Like-
5586680	5587680	Is that what you want?
5587680	5588680	Like what I'm going to do?
5588680	5589680	Like jerking off-
5589680	5590680	Maybe I said this incorrectly.
5590680	5595160	What I'm trying to say is I know that you've got a lot of flack for the baby, for wanting
5595160	5598840	to get the baby.
5598840	5603600	He's jerking off like one of Jeff's 13-year-old friends.
5603600	5608040	I'm just saying that I am on your side when it comes to wanting to take care of yourself.
5608040	5609040	Great.
5609040	5610040	All right.
5610040	5611040	Well, let's- you're in a trial period.
5611040	5613000	I'm going to have the baby, but we'll see.
5613000	5614000	And if you're okay-
5614000	5616000	Do you hear something?
5616000	5617000	No, right?
5617000	5618000	Okay.
5618000	5620360	I mean, it sounds like a trash can moving around.
5620360	5621360	Okay.
5621600	5627680	You, um, you can be- you can- if you're good, I'll let you have the baby, but-
5627680	5628680	Someone's making jello.
5628680	5629680	But-
5629680	5630680	Yeah.
5630680	5631680	Wait.
5631680	5633880	I definitely hear something.
5633880	5635400	How does making jello sound?
5635400	5641240	I think someone's making jello in a trash can and they're moving it around and it smells
5641240	5642240	good to them.
5642240	5645440	They're making it and they like the smell of the thing that they're making and they're
5645440	5646440	moving around the trash can.
5646440	5647440	What is it?
5647440	5649280	I'm going to make jello.
5649360	5652280	I'm going to go investigate this bush and just- it's moving it away.
5652280	5653280	Run away.
5653280	5654280	I run to a different bush.
5654280	5655280	I run to a different bush.
5655280	5656280	It's okay.
5656280	5658280	The bush is empty.
5658280	5659280	We're fine.
5659280	5660280	All right.
5660280	5661280	We're fine.
5661280	5662280	All right.
5662280	5663280	We'll understand.
5663280	5664280	I just-
5664280	5665280	Wait.
5665280	5666280	What did the dice say on that move?
5666280	5667280	Um, well, yeah.
5667280	5668280	I did roll the dice.
5668280	5669280	I did.
5669280	5670280	What happened?
5670280	5671840	He didn't hide very well.
5671840	5675280	He was right in that same bush.
5675280	5676280	Critical fail?
5676280	5678280	What the fuck, Sharpie?
5678280	5680280	What part of that were you jerking off?
5680280	5681280	What's going on?
5681280	5682280	Were you jerking off about the baby?
5682280	5683280	I'm making jello.
5683280	5684280	What's happening?
5684280	5685280	Wait, who's that?
5685280	5686280	Hey.
5686280	5688280	What's this guy doing in the bush?
5688280	5692280	He was jerking off while we were talking about who should take care of the baby.
5692280	5693280	Is that normal?
5693280	5694280	No.
5694280	5695280	Oh, good.
5695280	5696280	Oh, you're the baby?
5696280	5697280	Yep.
5698280	5699280	Baby.
5699280	5700280	I'm sorry, baby.
5700280	5701280	This is not about you.
5701280	5702280	Baby, what's your name?
5702280	5704280	You guys called me Laji.
5704280	5705280	Laji.
5705280	5706280	Laji.
5706280	5707280	Laji.
5707280	5708280	Is that the only voice you have?
5708280	5709280	It sure is.
5709280	5711280	It's one of my main voices.
5711280	5712280	All right, Laji.
5712280	5713280	We're fine.
5713280	5714280	Sorry.
5714280	5715280	He was making jello.
5715280	5716280	Stop it!
5716280	5717280	Sorry.
5717280	5718280	We're looking at you.
5718280	5720280	I jerk off during plot points.
5720280	5722280	That's my fetish.
5722280	5729280	I get turned on by plot points when the story changes direction.
5729280	5731280	That's the only thing that can make me come.
5731280	5732280	That sucks.
5732280	5735280	What we need you most is you're jerking off.
5736280	5737280	That's what turns me on about it.
5737280	5740280	Also weird because that wasn't a plot point.
5740280	5741280	Yeah.
5741280	5742280	It was more characterization if any.
5742280	5743280	It wasn't a plot point.
5743280	5745280	It was just character development.
5745280	5751280	Are you guys confronting me about a thing in a big way for the first time?
5751280	5754280	Because I'm going to come in my fucking pants.
5754280	5755280	All right.
5755280	5756280	All right.
5756280	5757280	All right.
5757280	5758280	Nope.
5758280	5759280	That's what it's all about for me.
5759280	5764280	You're creating plot points by jerking off and then the plot point is you jerking off.
5764280	5765280	I'm into thresholds.
5765280	5768280	I walk up and go, guys, it seems like we're really crossing.
5768280	5770280	It's a weird threshold here.
5770280	5771280	No!
5771280	5774280	No, no, don't use that word.
5774280	5775280	I can finish.
5775280	5776280	I don't care.
5776280	5779280	It wasn't meant to be the big deal.
5779280	5781280	You guys are talking about the baby.
5781280	5783280	I don't want to be a part of this.
5783280	5784280	Okay, great.
5784280	5786280	It seems like you very much want to be part of this.
5786280	5787280	No, no, no.
5787280	5789280	Is there a beach nearby?
5789280	5790280	No.
5790280	5791280	All right.
5791280	5792280	Let's go find a beach.
5792280	5793280	Let's go to the village.
5794280	5797280	Okay, I start masturbating at the idea of them going to a village.
5797280	5799280	I need to...
5799280	5803280	Sorry, this is just me, Spencer.
5803280	5807280	Making jello, you just stir a fluid in a bowl.
5807280	5810280	It sounds like a little spoon hitting another metal.
5810280	5811280	Yes, exactly.
5811280	5813280	And think about that noise.
5813280	5814280	That sounds nothing like...
5814280	5816280	You are not intimate with Dan Herman.
5816280	5817280	Oh, okay.
5817280	5818280	Sure.
5818280	5819280	It's all metal.
5819280	5820280	This is a specific detail.
5820280	5821280	What is the noise?
5821280	5823280	It's all metal spoons down there.
5823280	5824280	She's right.
5825280	5828280	It sounds like stirring up gelatinous fluid.
5830280	5833280	With an occasional garbage can moving like...
5833280	5837280	Everyone's jealousy getting in the way of tonight.
5837280	5839280	I take back that I was masturbating.
5839280	5840280	I'm sorry.
5840280	5842280	I want Spencer to take control.
5842280	5843280	All right.
5843280	5844280	Let's go into the place.
5844280	5845280	The Rose Book.
5845280	5846280	Rose Book, right.
5846280	5849280	So you're heading towards Rose Book and you can see.
5849280	5850280	No.
5850280	5851280	There's nothing important here.
5851280	5852280	Don't worry about it.
5852280	5853280	Nothing's going to happen.
5853280	5854280	You can see the happy.
5854280	5855280	Nothing's happening.
5855280	5856280	Nothing's happening.
5856280	5857280	The stakes are low.
5857280	5859280	You can see the happy little village.
5859280	5860280	Oh, great.
5860280	5861280	It's happy and little.
5861280	5867280	But on the path before you, you see it looks like a stopped horse and carriage surrounded
5867280	5870280	by green-skinned men.
5870280	5872280	On the top of the carriage, there's a little...
5872280	5877280	There must be a gnome or halfling standing on top of it like he's swinging a sack like
5877280	5878280	a weapon.
5879280	5881280	Is his expression friendly?
5881280	5883280	He's back is towards you.
5883280	5884280	These guys are...
5884280	5885280	It seems like these guys are robbing us.
5885280	5889280	So we should, I think, run up and disrupt this and help the poor man who's being attacked
5889280	5892280	by the green-skinned men, right?
5892280	5893280	All right.
5893280	5894280	Yeah.
5894280	5895280	Yeah.
5895280	5896280	Christopher, you're sneaky.
5896280	5897280	I'll go out and cause a diversion.
5897280	5899280	You sneak up and flank the guy swinging the sack.
5899280	5901280	One guy can't flank.
5901280	5902280	No.
5902280	5903280	No.
5903280	5904280	I'll go up and get his attention.
5904280	5905280	You flank him around the side.
5905280	5906280	I'll flank the other side.
5906280	5907280	And then what do I do?
5907280	5908280	We'll take it from there.
5908280	5909280	Okay.
5909280	5910280	All right.
5910280	5911280	What is Laji gonna do?
5911280	5912280	Laji's with me.
5912280	5913280	Laji's fine.
5914280	5915280	Don't worry about Laji.
5915280	5917280	I hope I get kicked!
5919280	5920280	What did he say?
5920280	5921280	What did he say?
5921280	5922280	Shit.
5922280	5923280	We've...
5923280	5924280	Don't worry about that.
5924280	5925280	Laji, what'd you say?
5925280	5926280	I hope I get kicked.
5926280	5927280	You hope you get kicked.
5927280	5929280	Laji, why do you hope you get kicked?
5929280	5932280	Oh, just things that happened in the past.
5932280	5934280	Jesus Christ, it's fucking horrible.
5934280	5936280	We have to fix this.
5936280	5937280	It's fine.
5937280	5938280	It's fine.
5938280	5939280	Let's fix that.
5939280	5940280	No.
5940280	5941280	Laji's fine.
5941280	5942280	He's a baby.
5942280	5943280	He hopes he gets kicked.
5943280	5944280	No, no, no.
5944280	5945280	He'll fuck up.
5945280	5946280	You're not helping if you're jerking off in the corner.
5946280	5947280	It's not...
5947280	5948280	I wasn't jerking off to the kid.
5948280	5949280	You're not contributing.
5949280	5951280	I was jerking off to the idea that we...
5951280	5952280	But I mean, you're not...
5952280	5953280	Something new was happening.
5953280	5954280	All right.
5954280	5955280	The kid's another man.
5955280	5959280	You don't get to high road us all of a sudden after jerking off in a bush.
5959280	5963280	I go up to the left side of this...
5963280	5965280	Is it like a coach kind of thing?
5965280	5966280	Yeah.
5966280	5967280	Like a stage coach.
5967280	5971280	So I run up and go like, what goes?
5971280	5974280	You see six orcs.
5974280	5975280	They're menacing.
5975280	5979280	A little gnome man standing atop his carriage.
5979280	5980280	He's like, ah!
5980280	5981280	Ah!
5981280	5982280	He's sorry.
5982280	5983280	Did you say a top-esque carriage?
5983280	5984280	Like a carriage of small plates?
5984280	5985280	A top.
5985280	5986280	He's a top.
5986280	5987280	A top.
5987280	5988280	I see.
5988280	5989280	That makes a lot more sense than what I envisioned.
5989280	5990280	No, no.
5990280	5991280	I was mumbling.
5991280	5992280	No, I'm sorry.
5992280	5993280	I'm a real mumble.
5994280	5996280	It looks like the orcs are attacking this business.
5996280	5997280	Yeah, we should...
5997280	5999280	I could have told you that.
5999280	6003280	I say to the orcs, hey, assholes.
6003280	6005280	You want to fuck with somebody?
6005280	6007280	Pick up somebody his own size.
6007280	6008280	And I'm also short.
6008280	6009280	Oh.
6009280	6010280	That's right.
6010280	6011280	Yeah.
6011280	6014280	And I have the baby, which is also about your size.
6014280	6015280	Right.
6015280	6016280	You emerge?
6016280	6017280	Huh?
6017280	6018280	Yeah, I come out too.
6018280	6024280	I also emerge when I say I know the recipe for your deaths.
6024280	6026280	Okay.
6026280	6028280	Can I hide?
6028280	6029280	Where is I?
6029280	6030280	Wait.
6030280	6031280	Are you going to hide?
6031280	6032280	Are you going to hide?
6032280	6033280	No, I'm done drinking off.
6033280	6034280	I want to hide in a bush.
6034280	6035280	Why are you hiding in a bush?
6035280	6036280	I want to hide.
6036280	6037280	We've made our play.
6037280	6039280	There's a bunch of orcs attacking a little guy.
6039280	6040280	Fine.
6040280	6041280	Okay.
6041280	6042280	All right.
6042280	6043280	I'm all blustery.
6043280	6044280	I go, hey, what do you guys want?
6044280	6045280	Your ass is kicked or what?
6045280	6046280	I know you're in your refractory period.
6046280	6047280	Fine.
6047280	6048280	You guys need to fill yourself together.
6048280	6050280	I don't think he ever came.
6050280	6051280	All right.
6051280	6052280	I can't.
6052280	6053280	I can't.
6053280	6054280	Okay.
6054280	6055280	I'm sorry.
6055280	6056280	He is in his refractory period.
6056280	6059640	So the biggest orcs or the biggest of the orcs he raises a large golden.
6059640	6060640	What is it?
6060640	6061640	An axe.
6061640	6066080	Large golden axe above his head and brings it down to the floor and his orcs charge.
6066080	6067080	What?
6067080	6071160	See, you guys need to fucking learn how to approach a city.
6071160	6076960	I fucking like you come up to the door and you go, Dan.
6076960	6077960	Can we come in?
6077960	6078960	Sharpie.
6078960	6079960	I know.
6079960	6080960	You can't give us notes right now.
6080960	6084520	You walk into a town and maybe there's going to be bad guys as you walk in.
6084520	6088520	So on the off chance that there's going to be bad guys, you just roll up and go, fuck
6088520	6089520	your mother.
6089520	6090520	Fuck everybody.
6090520	6092720	Fuck everything.
6092720	6093720	I didn't.
6093720	6094720	I just said, hey, what goes?
6094720	6095720	And they started attacking me.
6095720	6096720	No.
6096720	6097720	That's not what happened.
6097720	6098720	Don't revise history.
6098720	6099720	That's exactly what happened.
6099720	6102440	We rolled up and we were pricks to them and they were attacking us.
6102440	6103440	I'm going to kill them.
6103440	6104440	I'm going to kill them all.
6104440	6105440	I said, what goes?
6105440	6106440	I'm going to do it sarcastically.
6106440	6110200	I was just trying to, I saw, I saw a little halfling gnome guy and I thought, shit, he's
6110200	6111200	in trouble.
6111200	6112200	And I went, wait, what's up?
6112200	6113200	What's happening?
6113200	6114200	Now that, now they're charging us.
6114200	6115200	Let's get in there.
6115200	6116200	Get in the fight or get out.
6116200	6117200	Did you just call me?
6117200	6118200	I'm in the fight.
6118200	6119200	Did you call me Skinsir?
6119200	6120200	Skinsir.
6120200	6121760	I mean, I'm fine with it.
6121760	6123360	I like that better.
6123360	6126440	Um, can I, can I produce my whisper bow?
6126440	6127440	Yeah.
6127440	6128440	Okay.
6128440	6133440	And I'm going to fire that at, uh, the, the head, uh, orc.
6133440	6134440	Yeah.
6135440	6137440	I think over the minions first, right?
6137440	6138440	Don't die easier.
6138440	6139440	Should I, should I hit the minions?
6139440	6140440	Yeah.
6140440	6141440	Whatever's closest to you.
6141440	6142440	I would say.
6142440	6143440	Okay.
6143440	6145940	I'm going to, I'm going to fire at the minion that's close to me.
6145940	6146940	Closest to me.
6146940	6147940	All right.
6147940	6148940	Unbelievable.
6148940	6155680	You blast an arrow from your bow.
6155680	6157740	You blast two arrows from your bow.
6157740	6161800	The first one smashes him in the face, dealing six damage.
6161800	6163360	We just got here.
6163360	6164720	We just got to this city.
6164720	6165720	Sharpie.
6165720	6166720	It's too late.
6166720	6167720	The fight is, the fight is happening.
6167720	6168720	It's too late.
6168720	6169720	We just, it's too early.
6169720	6170720	What are you even doing?
6170720	6171720	We just got here.
6171720	6174720	You start, start chugging off again.
6174720	6175720	That's what you love.
6175720	6180760	The, that orc that you hit in the face, it dies, causing your second arrow to miss.
6180760	6181760	All right.
6181760	6182760	Nice.
6182760	6191280	I say under my breath, adventure, a feeling that I've forgotten over this.
6191280	6192280	Someone else go.
6192280	6193280	I'll have my ribbon dagger.
6194280	6195280	And I go for the next closest.
6195280	6196280	Ruben dagger?
6196280	6197280	Ruben dagger?
6197280	6198280	A ribbon dagger.
6198280	6200280	I'm mishearing everything and I'm envisioning things.
6200280	6201280	I'm hungry.
6201280	6202280	I'm hungry.
6202280	6203280	So you heard a Ruben.
6203280	6206280	I'll have the money, Krista sword and the.
6206280	6208280	I love Ruben.
6208280	6210280	Sarah crowd and Thousand Island.
6210280	6213280	We're just, we're not even in the city yet.
6213280	6214280	That's true.
6214280	6215280	Stop complaining.
6215280	6216280	She got in the city.
6216280	6217280	There's bad guys.
6217280	6219280	We're going to fucking, we're going to loot these people and they're going to have money.
6219280	6221280	Then we go to everything.
6221280	6224280	You're fucking raging about the government and jerking off in a bush.
6224280	6225280	Like, like you.
6225280	6226280	Yeah.
6226280	6229280	When did you lose your nerve, Sharpie?
6229280	6230280	Okay.
6230280	6231280	Eight cities ago.
6231280	6232280	I lost my nerve.
6232280	6233280	Kill yourself.
6233280	6234280	Tell me.
6234280	6235280	So, yeah.
6235280	6237280	And you know, I might do that.
6237280	6241280	I might, my character might go off and kill himself.
6241280	6243280	What do you think about that?
6243280	6244280	I think that's.
6244280	6249280	I don't think you have the guts.
6249280	6250280	I dare you to go.
6250280	6251280	I dare you to go.
6251280	6252280	Kill yourself.
6252280	6255280	I'll roll the dice for you.
6255280	6258280	All right.
6258280	6264280	The only way you can win is by killing yourself.
6264280	6270280	I mean, it's better than there being a problem with everything that's happening at every
6270280	6272280	burn.
6272280	6276280	You guys don't, you guys were being attacked by orcs right now.
6276280	6278280	We came up to the city.
6278280	6281280	Am I so drunk that I don't understand this?
6281280	6282280	I think maybe.
6282280	6283280	Yes.
6283280	6284280	Yes.
6284280	6285280	The answer is yes.
6285280	6286280	Spencer, like, it's Camille's move, right?
6286280	6287280	You're still delivering Camille's damage, right?
6287280	6288280	We walked up.
6288280	6289280	There was a guy being attacked.
6289280	6290280	Camille and I decided to go help.
6290280	6293280	There was absolutely no need to attack me.
6293280	6294280	We didn't attack shit.
6294280	6298280	We walked up and got in a flanking position and said, what the fuck is happening?
6298280	6299280	And they started attacking us.
6299280	6300280	That's what happened.
6300280	6301280	It's true.
6301280	6302280	Also, you jerked off.
6302280	6303280	Spencer, really?
6303280	6306280	Well, what do you think happened, Dan?
6306280	6309280	There wasn't a non-conflict resolution to this encounter.
6309280	6310280	No, no, don't.
6310280	6312280	What do you think is happening right now in the game?
6312280	6315280	We came up to a city, a brand new city.
6315280	6316280	Yes.
6316280	6319280	And we started attacking them.
6319280	6320280	That's what I think happened.
6320280	6321280	No.
6321280	6322280	We did not.
6322280	6323280	That's not what happened.
6323280	6324280	All right.
6324280	6325280	This is out of turn.
6325280	6326280	Well, we should tell them what happened, right?
6326280	6327280	It's Camille's turn.
6327280	6328280	Camille's turn, right?
6328280	6329280	We walked up.
6329280	6330280	We walked up.
6330280	6333280	There was a stagecoach with a guy defending himself with a sack over his head, and there
6333280	6335280	were eight orcs attacking him.
6335280	6337280	And I came up and said, hey, what goes?
6337280	6342280	And with Christopher flanking around the side, and they turned to us and started attacking
6342280	6343280	me.
6343280	6344280	I'm sorry.
6344280	6345280	It's okay.
6345280	6348280	And we spoke last night for like 40 minutes.
6348280	6349280	I'm sorry.
6349280	6350280	I'm sorry.
6350280	6351280	I'm sorry.
6351280	6353280	And I didn't mean to cut Aaron off.
6353280	6357280	We went down this path so long, it's like we had to go down it again when we could just
6357280	6358280	end it.
6358280	6359280	It's okay.
6359280	6360280	Can I take out my sword?
6360280	6361280	Yeah.
6361280	6362280	I have my ribbon dagger that I threw.
6362280	6363280	Oh, yeah.
6363280	6364280	I'm sorry.
6364280	6365280	It's okay.
6365280	6366280	Just the arm.
6366280	6373280	But poison courses through his veins and he almost instantly just falls down dead.
6373280	6376280	Okay.
6376280	6377280	I feel terrible.
6377280	6378280	I feel terrible.
6378280	6379280	I take out my sword.
6379280	6380280	Wait.
6380280	6381280	It's somebody else's turn.
6381280	6382280	No, no.
6382280	6383280	It's her turn now.
6383280	6384280	Oh, okay.
6384280	6385280	I take out my sword.
6385280	6391280	In my pocket, there's a letter, but I take out my sword.
6391280	6396280	I stab my eyes and I drag the sword.
6396280	6397280	That's just what's happening.
6397280	6401280	I take the sword and I drag, I stab both of my eyes like I can hardly see.
6401280	6404280	The sword is in my left eye socket.
6404280	6407280	I drag it down to my heart.
6407280	6408280	Oh my God.
6408280	6413280	I get it down to my heart and I mix it around like I'm mixing a cake mix.
6413280	6414280	Like you're making Jell-O.
6414280	6417280	Like I'm making Jell-O.
6417280	6422280	And then I drag it down to my stomach and I open up my stomach and I take out my intestines
6422280	6426280	and I make a necklace and I make a little like goodbye.
6426280	6432280	I write goodbye with my intestines and I die.
6432280	6433280	I thought that we were a child.
6433280	6434280	And I die.
6434280	6435280	She has to roll for it.
6435280	6436280	She has to roll for it.
6436280	6437280	He has to roll.
6437280	6438280	Oh, I rolled it.
6438280	6439280	Yeah.
6439280	6442280	I just, my only question, here's my only question.
6442280	6445280	How hard are you trying to stab yourself in the eyes?
6446280	6447280	I get everything else.
6447280	6448280	Real hard.
6448280	6449280	Yeah.
6449280	6450280	Okay.
6450280	6451280	Real hard.
6451280	6452280	Yeah.
6452280	6453280	All right.
6453280	6454280	Yeah.
6454280	6455280	I'm trying to, I am stabbing myself in the eyes.
6455280	6456280	I have a letter in my pocket.
6456280	6459280	But as you're doing that, I say to the baby, she would have made a terrible mother.
6459280	6461280	That's Hermitown, everybody.
6461280	6464280	Thank you for coming.
6464280	6467280	All right.
6467280	6474280	What a cliffhanger.
6474280	6477280	I really thought we were just coming up to a city.
6477280	6479280	I should probably drink while I'm staring at the show.
6479280	6480280	No, it's fine.
6480280	6481280	So we should go to the next space.
6481280	6487280	Let's hear it for Tanisha's D, who is apparently here.
6487280	6492280	Camille Nantiani, Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Dana Carvey.
6492280	6495280	I'm Jeff.
6495280	6496280	Sorry I was late.
6496280	6497280	Dan Harmon is your mayor.
6497280	6498280	Thanks very much, everybody.
