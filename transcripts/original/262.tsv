89600	95000	Like now you just hear your own voice and you feel like it feels more legitimate feels like I'm a radio show host
95000	95720	Yes
95720	98720	Feels like I'm supposed to have a point of view or anything like that
98720	105040	But I'm gonna confine my points of view to my myself like I'm always supposed to do it's a comedy podcast
105060	112820	It is I am a comedy podcast personality people come here for the the laughs of funny things my point of view

118220	120220	so these are humorous
121100	128180	Items, but I do think we're gonna end up talking a lot about the Harvey Weinstein thing and the explosion that's resolved what happened
128420	130420	I'll explain in a second all right
130420	135360	Let's we should probably do like some kind of title sequence for for this segment, right?
135360	141180	Oh the heart of the heart harm you want to skip right to that the headline item. Yeah, okay here comes stayin hormones
141920	143920	headlines
144000	148080	Oh, this is the over you yeah, well, I keep biting my own lip
149360	151040	Not in a sexy way
151040	155480	That's one of the things that which part the inside like right on the side
156480	162260	Cankers I do now I've created my it's a self-created canker. This is the headline. Let's not go
162260	164620	Let's not let the okay. I'll back up text go along
165620	167620	Back it off. That's number one
168300	170300	number two dick and Morty the
170860	174620	I saw a trailer for every can wordy porn parody that I
175280	182180	That I don't even I haven't even stopped to examine whether my feelings are good bad or anything. I'm just excited
182180	184180	It's the best of both worlds
185620	187620	the tangible
188060	191180	nominal name recognition and basic
191860	193040	physical
193040	197140	Resemblance to Rick and Morty and then you have real people having sex
197420	204500	It's truly what some weirdo who has a weird fetish for Rick and Morty would like and not just you know in
204940	208820	Assholes interpretation of what one of those fans would like it's a
209420	213260	We're talking about this a lot longer than just a headline. Oh shit
213280	215280	I don't want to be like
216800	221320	Right, yeah, okay. I watched my cousin Vinnie and it kind of holds up in some ways
222080	223920	Okay, good
223920	228540	The the me to Facebook thing. It's kind of a that's kind of a related to the Weinstein thing
230240	231920	Rose McGowan
231920	237880	McGowan whether whether we should not you're gonna go that was one of my it might is it is it going or going?
237880	241360	He's going. Yeah, I think it's all right. Well Rose McGowan well
241380	247020	Let's let's have a let's have a let's have a big conversation about what how we're how we are and aren't supposed to say things
247020	252860	Starting with the word McGowan McGowan, but that's all the same thing that the me to Facebook thing and the Weinstein thing
252860	255220	That's all the same time with me to Facebook. Yeah
256300	259860	That's something Cody told me about it, but but if I start talking about it, okay
260420	262420	We're still in the title sequence
262580	268300	Then I wrote down power dynamics just because but really isn't that the same thing and then I wrote down the word
268600	273800	I wrote down the word sex worker. Let's start with that because this is that this is such a quick show sex worker
273800	280280	Let's call this segment. Um, what what what what what's what's what? What did I miss? How do you know when you're finished?
280920	282920	the the I I
283040	285040	how
285080	289040	The the word prostitute is problematic now, right? Yeah, this I'm
290320	295120	You at home. I'm not doing a sarcastic bit where I'm like going like you tell me exactly
295460	297780	But that is what I'm doing, but I'm not doing it in parody
297780	305800	I'm being sincere and wanted to talk about words that into the radar that I don't know how long how much longer than the word
306020	308020	prostitute has been
308060	311780	Is it on the chopping block that I've been using it? Well, it's the oldest
313300	315300	What'd you say you're the oldest
315900	317900	it's
318820	320820	It's so
321600	325400	I would well, I don't I don't know. I don't think that's it
325400	332400	I think sex worker is a more encompassing term that applies to more people, but I don't know that prostitute is necessarily
332400	339640	I mean it might be what what's the difference? Well, you could be for instance, like a I don't want to say a cam whore
339640	345280	But you could be a cam model and that's not necessarily a prostitute, but it is sex work
346220	348880	Is that is that is adult film acting
349660	352140	Yeah, you call that sex work. They're not offended by
353140	355140	being lumped in with
356260	362340	Is it that we're knocking off are we merging the idea that sex work is sex work and because we want to not say
362740	367980	Because it's too like biblical and provincial probably to go. Well your sex work involves
368960	376160	Really mean in it or something like like we've been we've been it's these divisions that that need to go probably as part of it
376160	381000	I think it's a prostitute is I mean it's only one kind of sex work
381000	384720	And so if you're like, oh you're just a prostitute and they're like no
384720	385440	I'm a sex worker
385440	390240	Then it's like you're kind of putting them in a more narrow box where they meet people and have sex with them when that might
390240	396120	Not be what's for sale, you know, like even like even a dominatrix might not just meet people and have sex with them
396140	402960	But they're almost certainly a sex worker. Yeah, I've I had an ex-girlfriend who worked as she worked as a she never she never touched anybody
402960	405460	She was a shoot her job was to like whip guys in a dungeon
405460	412180	Something happened on my microphone or my headphones or my ego and that I and I can't hear myself. I can hear you
412180	415820	I can hear you're fine. All right, so you can't hear your voice at all in your cans
415820	421140	It's like it's like drifting in and out now like as if I'm subject to some kind of voice activated
421660	425180	Network, maybe you're maybe you're losing your hearing
425440	426760	right
426760	428720	great
428720	434020	Now's the time to find out. All right, so it's like it's it's hard to have these conversations because I want to like I
434640	439040	Sound like what I know the bad guy in my head sounds like when I have
440280	448280	Potentially passive-aggressive conversations, which is not what I'm trying to do about the actual I'm fascinated and I do welcome the evolution of language
448280	452280	I see I don't I'm not I'm not a person that wants to
452580	460200	caution against the slippery slope of modifying language even though I was 20 years ago like and now I look at it differently and I'm
460420	463860	Fascinated by it. That's why I like having these conversations
463860	468420	I have like a like like you it's it's not every day that you you someone
468860	474260	Lets you know that a word you're using is like changing and it's like fashion
475660	481820	Fashionability is that how this started you were you were saying so well, you know these prostitutes and someone went
482300	484300	I can't remember and I'm not gonna
484660	490620	It's not it's not anecdote worthy that conversation. Okay, it's not at all backing off. It's it's more like
491380	493380	it's
493660	497900	Here's what here's what kind of interests me about it is like we don't have a
499500	504700	We don't we don't we how do you tell there's no newsletter and that's what the bad guys say
504700	509300	Well, so would you tell me the rules lay and it's like no, why don't you why don't you fucking think?
509520	517520	But well, when was I supposed to think about that as opposed to salt pepper and other words that I use completely unconsciously and
518160	523320	This ties into everything that we'll be talking about that isn't funny because it's not a comedy podcast
523320	527840	And I'm not being funny and I don't I why did the chicken do the thing?
527840	532000	I don't know because he felt disempowered. I I'm gonna talk about whatever I want to talk about. I
533000	537680	Know that I keep doing this where I keep lashing out at a hypothetical audience then saying that I hate you and you're like
537740	539020	We didn't hate you why you yelling at me?
539020	543900	I but I do I just like if you're right now if you're judging me that you know who you are
543900	549860	I don't I judge you back. I judge you harder. I judge you first. I I don't like you. I don't like you
549860	556060	I don't I'd never liked you and me liking you means means more than you not liking me. You're done you lost
556060	562020	You're at a crater. You're not even a person. You're a crater with shoes that just moves around wherever you stand
562680	569480	Identifies the point where I have I have power over you. So stop judging me. You've been judged. I'm gonna proceed with my podcast
569480	572120	I don't know if I'm gonna be funny political what side I'm on
572120	578680	I don't know what when I'm talking and when there's diarrhea coming out of my mouth that's doing good and when it's doing bad
578680	583200	I just talk and it's it's become my job. I've given it to myself as a job
583360	590480	Here's how I feel tonight about the following things. Sorry. I said all that no. All right, here we go. So
591380	593380	Top topic number one or
593940	599260	Descending order. Well, okay. My therapist said uh-huh. You know, what's happening right now
599900	601900	men women Weinstein
602620	604620	Whatever the language
605900	611340	Arguments everything what's happening right now is a revolution of consciousness versus unconsciousness
611940	617500	So all of the things that you're doing and saying and being without thinking about them
617920	621200	that has become the new thing that we're recognizing as
623520	625440	Problematic and
625440	629800	what we're starting to put a higher value on and trying to create a
630400	633720	Society based on is the are the things that we're thinking about
634520	637440	Say say that again. It's it's it's we're
638600	645760	It's consciousness versus unconsciousness. Okay, so the like we've come out of an era of celebrating unconsciousness
646420	649580	So give me an example of the old era versus the newer
649580	656620	Yeah, like the the archetype of the narcissist being like kind of a hero like like that's the old way
656660	657660	Yeah, okay
657660	663140	Like we're starting to we're starting the narcissism is starting to be looked at not
664060	667100	it's not like anti hero cool like
667660	673460	Like oh you're another person that isn't thinking about anybody but themself and you're sucking your thumb. It's damping your feet
673800	675640	That was pretty chic
675640	681360	Three and a half fiscal quarters ago socially and we're just the bubble has burst on that market
681880	685280	I'm putting I'm putting words in my therapist mouth because she does not think
685920	691240	I'm trying to I'm trying to figure like okay, so when I think
692400	697480	Narcissist like it's our terms of like television movie. I think it's like somebody like Ted Danson and in Cheers
697740	703260	Is that the old way or people are certain people used to think like oh that guy's like a scoundrel
703260	707060	He's an asshole, but now is that person a hero or is it the opposite?
707060	712380	I think we're starting to we're starting to that's gone out of fashion. If you pick that character, okay
712380	716540	That's Jeff winger from Cheers, right? That's Larry David and Curb your enthusiasm. Okay, okay
716540	721540	This is every this is everybody right? This is everybody is now this is all the funny
722360	728100	This is the funny from like for a long time and the new hero is
728800	732660	Like say what is there a new example like Jay Jay?
733240	739440	Baruchel people who know themselves people who are I don't I you're you're I just I I
740320	747160	I know you're not doing doing anything. You're not trying to do anything to me. No, no, I'm trying to understand
747160	749160	Yeah, I feel like you're you're
749380	754460	Tumbling me over into a hole like like like where I'm pitching you what's funny and what's not funny
754460	756820	No, no, no. No, I just want to understand what you're
757700	764340	I'm a visual person. So, you know, I just I'm trying to follow you I can back off back. No, no, no just stick
764340	768340	Let's let's come in back. Let's think about ourselves for a second. All right, so
769620	770860	how
770860	772860	much have you been thinking about
773260	775260	what you actually
775260	781480	Feel like what you want to be right and wrong and what you stuff like for instance you in the time that I've known you
781920	783920	you became like a
784920	789720	Animal person. Yes, Nick and that and that graduated from your love of your dog to
790440	794120	Not that I'm tracing your your evolution. I'm just saying like
794960	799920	that's how I remember the events happening and then there was a certain point where you you became
800580	807440	Vegetarian or vegan and you became like you don't you don't you think that you you you became guided by a new principle you
807440	810380	You you and it was based on you deciding for yourself
810980	817940	That you don't want regardless of what you think is right for the world or what everyone should do
818300	823500	You had to start with yourself and you had to go. I like animals like I don't want to hurt them
824580	829700	Yes, and that changed about you. Yeah, that's that that is that is something. There's a major change
829920	835740	so what if you know, like what if what's going on with the Weinstein thing is like a chance for
836980	841460	guys like me to you know have a similar level of
842940	848820	Inventory taking about our relationship with women which just equated them with food
849180	850540	but
850540	856340	Part of the point but but like I have been I don't know about you, but I imagine every guy has been kind of like
856340	858340	a
859160	862240	Looking past the shoebox of what you're
862820	869120	Like what it's supposed to be happening and then you've been checking in with like some lower gut, right?
869120	869640	Yeah
869640	874840	well, I mean just in terms of like in the last couple of years like just I
876120	882520	Like Kate has really helped me like see things that I haven't noticed before because it's been so normalized
882520	889620	You know in terms of like entertainment and and TV and and just how people treat each other and and I'm blind to it
889620	892120	Because I I'm the only person that I've ever been
893140	895140	and
895220	896720	You know, I have my own problem
896720	900780	So, you know like see having Kate like kind of point things out to me
900780	905100	It starts being more and more aware and then when things like this start happening
905660	910020	you know the shit that's happening with with Rose McGowan on Twitter and
910480	913320	You know like everybody coming out and just it's
914280	920880	It is it I do feel like man, you know, why have I I've been a part of the problem, right?
921880	926120	My entire life, you know going back through your whole life. Yeah, haven't you for the last?
926520	935280	absolutely the same way when I went vegan like I mean did I went went that way because of absolute like guilt and
935440	937440	I've been such a
938180	943660	Like overzealous, you know trying to find like that that happy medium where I'm you know
944260	949100	trying to tell people what I'm going through and why it happened and and and without
949940	954820	You know putting people off, you know, which which you know, this is you know, what women, you know
954820	958820	You know, like they're in that same position where they're like, no you got to listen to me
958820	963340	This is what I'm going through but you don't want to be a buzzkill a pain
963340	966780	No one wants to hear anybody whine and complain about stuff like that
966800	969480	Right. Well, there's people don't want to feel guilty
969480	971400	They don't want they don't want to feel uncomfortable and guilty
971400	974680	So they avoid the conversation or they roll their eyes or they walk away
974840	982500	We're all having conversations right now where we're catching ourselves and each other in at a rate of like way for me way faster
982600	986520	More infractions per minute too because that's the topic that's being talked about
986920	991880	so it's kind of like it's like one thing I want to say to my
992840	995840	my brother out there and
996420	998420	Boned
998420	1001980	Is why are you raising my niece on Facebook? I
1003820	1007020	I've never met her. Are you really that mad? I talked about you
1008660	1011580	No, my actual brother my which is the public
1012100	1018340	But the and the male half of that public like I keep thinking to myself. I keep going like, you know what?
1019260	1024540	What we're watching play out is is this there's this part of it that we own
1025080	1030480	Which is the the easy part. It's the it's the not thinking about it part
1031080	1036160	Where because don't you find yourself every day like like?
1037840	1045200	Is that like thinking something and then because you're old and rich and bored and tired maybe like let's get let's give a break to
1045840	1046840	our
1046840	1048840	our more amped up
1049100	1055860	20-year-old brethren who because I just remember being a piece of fucking shit the further back you go. Mm-hmm
1055860	1058140	So I can't judge today's
1058660	1064940	23-year-old because if I was a guest on this podcast at the age of 23 I as a
1065300	1069860	44 year old minus that awareness would would like
1070980	1074980	Make a fucking huge show of telling him what a big dumb piece of shit
1075040	1079720	Yeah, it wouldn't help. Well, it's just you know, it's like, you know old people telling
1080360	1085040	Why do you got a dress like that? Why you listen that garbage music? It's not real music or whatever
1085040	1091200	And you know, it's just how because they're new to the world and they're they're trying out stuff
1091200	1093200	And there aren't any classes no
1094040	1100920	Because you can't charge money for it effectively without becoming litigatable. Yeah, in other words, we don't have a culture
1101020	1108020	We don't have like we used to we make we rightfully make fun of our forebears for having these like these horrible classes
1108340	1110860	Societies that and part of it was okay
1110860	1114820	here's the book on whether a woman gets into an elevator first and all of this shit and
1115060	1119900	All of that stuff is rightfully like we spit on it. We wipe our asses with it
1119900	1124940	It's so uncool the Fonz doesn't have that book the Fonz just does it's all about like
1125440	1132720	That American value system of like why would you ever why would you have a rule book for interacting with blah blah blah?
1133120	1140040	Great that we threw that in the furnace and all that stuff and then now you have this thing of like wait you mean
1141080	1143320	being 15 years old and
1144720	1147440	Not having ever any conversations about
1148060	1152820	What we're supposed to be doing and what's going on in
1153340	1161060	Any fucking way that me that that drives off society like oh you mean I should just I'll just figure that shit out and part
1161060	1167940	Of it'll be owned by my parents and that'll be owned by what city or state they live in and that'll be whatever high school
1167940	1174780	I went to subdivisions what base I am what class I am what income bracket what whether there was a freeway within 50 yards of
1174780	1182960	Me or a or a or a power line. It's like how is that shit so like we we we done fucked up in one regard
1183160	1185160	Like we don't have
1185760	1193640	Training we're not telling we have movies in TV. That's our only train said classes, but that's not interaction
1193640	1195640	You know what we didn't what we I mean
1196040	1200400	Physical interaction. Well, what is it like? Let's just put like what why are you arguing?
1200400	1204860	I don't know what you guys are arguing right? No, you're you're policing absolute statements
1204860	1210740	We're saying I'm making I'm expressing a point which is we're in a mire of non-education about how to interact with
1210740	1217740	I don't I think I think in today in 2017 sex ed classes are maybe more robust than they've ever been
1218400	1222440	Okay, but but okay, so Spencer's like like this is that today's
1223440	1230480	Got to be conversations on consent back in the past. All right, so now there are so right now
1230960	1237000	Mm-hmm. What you're saying is the problem has been solved. No, I don't I'm saying there are discussions
1237000	1242840	I mean like in classrooms, you're saying that there's not I don't I think there are okay
1245920	1251920	Yeah, it's a lot of it not nothing I say for the next 40 to 60 minutes is gonna
1253440	1257480	Actually be factual. Okay. Okay. I'm taught I'm pretending I'm making pretends
1259120	1261400	The so we don't have
1262560	1269560	We have no sexual culture in our in in modern society. We are we are mystifying it
1269560	1272580	We are telling each other in random combinations
1273320	1279040	That it's it's up to you be yourself like oh, it's nature. It's nurture
1279360	1281040	We are we are
1281040	1283440	It is a fundamental thing about us
1283880	1287960	The way that we interact with each other and it is the most mystical thing
1287960	1294080	It's the thing that we just let be a drift because the alternative would be to have rules for that shit, which we
1294840	1296480	interpret as being
1296480	1302680	Like a horrible idea because of the culture that we've come from where there were a lot of rules for that shit
1303680	1304840	So
1304840	1310800	What do we do? How do we combat that without going hierarchical without going to having the pendulum swing back?
1310800	1318560	The only answer is just communication. It's just a club. It's a it's everybody saying when you hear something when you see something
1318960	1326680	then like we have to like figure out how we actually feel about it because when we keep talking to each other about it like
1327200	1331280	We keep we keep doing wrong. I think we've created like a a
1333320	1340480	Culture for instance to use the women thing that is going on right now a culture of silence that we can contribute without even knowing it
1340480	1346800	So how many times I mean like we don't have to play some weird confession game, but like how complicit do you feel?
1348000	1356680	Like when you see that stuff you go like yeah, you know what? I yeah, I I it gets frustrating because I look back at
1357560	1359980	High school and and where we were
1360480	1367760	Nobody sits down and tells you how to interact with people, you know men women, you know young old
1367840	1374880	They don't sit you down and you you're just kind of thrown into the woods and you got to figure it out on your own
1375000	1380920	and so you get like all these beta males who are you know, like weaker or not as confident and then they
1381440	1387200	They get into these positions of power and they still don't know how to deal with people and they don't know how to deal
1387200	1389200	You also think and I'm speaking for myself
1390280	1395160	You think as a nerd that that there's like this mythology you're following
1395720	1401260	From our generation. Let's be specific about that and speaking for myself. It's like, oh, yeah
1401260	1408560	like if you're a nerd then you can compensate you can become the jock of having being a nerd with
1409040	1412520	Power with money with something to offer. That's what happened with Weinstein
1412520	1420100	but it gets translated into sex somewhere in your workflow unless you're blessed enough to be yeah, like
1420600	1426960	neurologically asexual like if you if if they it somehow gets tied in because there's no conversation about
1427280	1430960	Where I have abused my power dynamic at work. I
1432120	1436640	Didn't know I was doing it when I did it. I I didn't I never took notice
1437640	1444720	That I never thought to myself until after the whole thing happened and I looked back and was like, why was that such a relative disaster?
1445320	1447320	oh because
1447360	1450840	If you have a crush on someone that works for you
1452480	1459560	You are not it's not the same as having a crush on someone at a library or a bar that doesn't work for you
1459560	1464280	Yeah, you fucking idiot. Yeah, I but I don't it's like
1464680	1470000	That is happening on every block in every and then in our industry
1470000	1476720	It's like because you get like we're not we're not going like okay. I oh shit. I have a crush on Stacy. I
1478120	1484280	Wonder I bet I should just see if she wants to go to that thing or whatever and you're not who's gonna stop and ask themselves
1484280	1488680	oh, just am I really giving Stacy the opportunity to
1489680	1493160	Not be interested in going to see a movie with me and also
1493680	1500960	Continuing to know whether or not she's good at being a writer or whether it's like you don't like there is no
1501160	1503160	there was no
1503160	1508320	But you're going on Batman the ride sign and line that I waited in and documentation. I
1509040	1514160	I found I I got that into my head by doing it wrong
1514160	1520480	I I did it wrong and I'm really ashamed of it when I look back on it fortunately for me
1520480	1522480	I'm not like like I I
1523120	1524720	like I
1524720	1526720	Like I never
1526880	1530480	Just like that's part of that nerd thing. It's like yeah, but I know I never did anything
1530880	1533520	Yeah, and then like that doesn't matter
1533520	1538760	It's like what the problem exists on the root level of your brain. It's like what if you could have done something?
1538760	1542560	Yeah, what if you could have gotten your way? You could have you could you?
1544160	1550480	only know at the time like that you what you want and then and then you're used to thinking of yourself as an underdog and
1550480	1552280	you go like well, I
1552280	1557080	Like that in the movies and the TV shows it's like oh the guy that uses everything
1557080	1560600	He's got going for him to turn things around with a special lady
1560800	1567240	It's like because you don't play sports. You're not gonna you know, I'm not gonna be a date rapist because I'm the underdog
1567240	1571440	I'm the I'm the guy. Well, I'm never gonna be wearing a polo shirt. I'm never gonna be wearing a mask
1571440	1574840	They're never they'll never be on my yacht. I'll never date rape anyone. Sure
1575920	1581360	Every when we yeah, so well, I'm not I'm not lecturing anybody watching or listening. I'm talking to myself
1581360	1583360	I just want I was eager to
1583720	1589640	when we saw that Terry Crews thing on Twitter, like I like like I
1590080	1594800	Fucking like I'm in I'm in a post Terry Crews six tweet thread
1595520	1597000	It's a
1597000	1605520	Harmon soul and it's not because of what it's it's not it's because of what I realized about myself when I read that thing
1605840	1611920	because I read through it and Terry Crews is a gigantic physically fit like
1613160	1614960	charming
1614960	1620120	Alpha beyond alpha dude who's just saying yeah one time I went to a party and
1620560	1625200	My drunk boss came up to me and grabbed my nuts and there was nothing I could do about it
1625200	1629500	And I was all bummed out and I froze and then I was like what the fuck was that and my wife was like
1629500	1635240	Don't do anything about it because if you do what what do you gain versus what do you lose blah blah blah?
1635240	1637520	I'm not I just put words in Terry Crews's
1638880	1641620	Those I paraphrased that but there's like a conversation
1642240	1645720	She wasn't like Lady Macbeth of the matrix going like oh
1645960	1653360	You got to lose by acquiescing to the nut-grabbing. No, like she's like, but his point was he froze and was like
1653640	1659480	Like and in there and then and then and then it happened. Yeah, and then and then he didn't talk about it, etc
1660240	1665280	so his point was if I can be a victim and Matt, you know now are you listening and
1665840	1672440	A point well taken but the the reason why I am shattered to the core by that story is because I read it and
1672960	1676080	The entire time I'm reading it. I'm going no way
1677400	1680360	Or like like I want to read that differently
1680360	1686240	That's this is the important thing is that I'm going I'm like I'm reading the Terry Crews thing and I'm going no way
1686960	1691240	that's and if and then realizing that
1691920	1693920	Why is that story?
1693920	1697920	Like is it more believable to me? It's less. It's less believable
1698480	1700480	narratively which makes it for
1700800	1703960	Good storytelling. Oh, no way
1705120	1707120	Jack went up a beanstalk
1707320	1712120	Wow, no way Terry Crews got got sexually assaulted
1712200	1715080	it's a simultaneous expression of disbelief and
1715600	1721760	I'm I'm all over it and I'm so invested and I have not I'm not I like yeah
1722520	1729680	Awesome, like not awesome that it happened. But like no way. Are you fucking kidding me when we express incredulity skepticism?
1730600	1735480	And I was like wait, how is this different from it? Like I don't know how I caught myself
1735480	1742800	But imagining that any woman any woman 240 pound black muscle-bound woman doesn't really matter
1743040	1749920	Like like like I don't think I just picturing just okay change his gender. Just change Terry Crews to a woman
1751160	1757840	And I was like I I I'm rattling with the realization that there was like a clear
1758720	1762960	Difference for me that that when a woman when I hear about a woman being
1764280	1766800	Like having this crazy shit happen to her
1769040	1771200	It I have some kind of like
1772200	1777600	Force field that it just needs to there's just a little checkpoint. That's just there's no big deal
1777600	1782280	I just need to see your ID before you get on the plane. That's no big deal. Everyone can get on a plane
1782920	1788560	There's a fucking checkpoint there that I saw where I was like, I it wasn't placed there consciously
1788560	1796560	I do not choose. I was not choosing. I never chose. I never knew that's why I was shook to the fucking core because I was like
1797040	1801680	The fuck is your problem? And then I found that you found it less believable
1801680	1807800	I was when a woman tells me a story when in the past when a woman has told me a story
1808280	1814120	Whether it's not when she's coming to me as an employer and say whatever when it gets official and all that stuff
1814640	1821520	Equally important conversation about what we do in the workplace not stuff. I'm talking about when a woman is confiding in you
1822640	1826000	That some something insane
1826920	1828680	happened to her
1828680	1831760	at the hands of a predator in
1832360	1838840	The moment some of these these seconds Terry Cruz's story is three and a half seconds long really six tweets
1839240	1845520	Three and a half seconds drunk boss in the middle of everyone at the I'm assuming I pictured on a dance floor
1845520	1847040	It really doesn't matter
1847040	1848240	It was part of it
1848240	1848640	anyways
1848640	1855600	But like like these stories like I in my head I look back over my whole life and I
1855960	1860320	It's not it's not as simple as I believe women less it
1860320	1862720	I think the irony is that it has something to do with
1863400	1865400	this chivalry
1866080	1869160	You're in charge. That's why they're telling you in the first place
1869600	1875240	You're you're you're you have to decide when Terry Cruz tells me a guy grabbed his nuts at a party
1875240	1881000	I don't have to decide what to do about it. I don't have to I'm not in charge of whether it's true
1881080	1887320	So I just fucking believe it and my immediate reaction is well, let's not work with that guy ever again
1887320	1893680	And and and I look back through my life and I'm realizing that like women saying like, you know
1893680	1900440	That guy on the corner not work related like whatever your neighbor or this this happened to me or that
1900680	1904960	Waiter at that restaurant. Well, we were getting scrambled eggs and then he said this or that
1905520	1909920	And I have the same verbal outward reaction. So no one can police it
1911440	1913440	No way
1913440	1915080	but I
1915080	1916840	When I read the Terry Crews thing
1916840	1923040	I was like I saw like I don't care if you call it a nanometer or a millimeter or a foot or 20 yards a
1923440	1928280	Difference. I have a different setting. I think it's because we're supposed to be cowboys
1928280	1935400	I said like like like we're like, okay now Stacy now now just just give me one second to take that in
1935920	1941600	That's interesting that you're saying because if I go up to Arnold the busboy at the Grand Buffet and punch him out
1941640	1947880	Like that's all the unspoken stuff is like yeah, no one asked you to do anything except believe them
1947880	1954020	Yeah, and that but you're already in this like Fonzie mode of like now hold on. Are you trying to use my Fonzie?
1954960	1962280	Strength to you're not gonna do anything anyway. Yeah, but like your brain is like my brain has been wired. What happened with nothing? Oh
1963280	1966080	All right. Well anyways, but I think that's an interesting
1967000	1969000	point that
1969720	1973200	That when a guy says oh this happened to be you go
1973200	1977540	Oh, wow, and you don't feel responsible, but like if a woman says something to you you
1978120	1981320	Part it. I mean like I used to get I go like
1982000	1986300	Now I am I you want me to beat this person? Yeah, where you want? Yeah
1986300	1991640	But are you sure because I guess I don't want to I don't want to get interact with something
1991640	1995040	I don't I'm not good what it's just it all becomes like
1995680	1999960	Ooh, this hurts me when a crisis happening. Somebody else is like look
1999960	2005600	No, just believe me and and comfort me and trace it back to like Terry Crews
2005680	2009200	It's like it's like he's not asking you to do anything. Yeah
2009800	2015720	That's a and then if you said that to women then they would go I wasn't I wanted you to believe me
2015720	2018560	Yeah, it's it's it's no. Oh
2020280	2025000	I believe is something I do before I am do nothing that thank you
2025000	2031240	That is I look I'm not if you're watching or listening. I'm not I'm not preaching to you. You're different than me
2031240	2038040	I think that like I'm dumb that like we have to if you're listening to me like
2038520	2042520	Like start like nothing bad can happen to you
2042520	2046000	I am NOT going to be taken up to an electric chair in a mountain tomorrow
2046000	2049000	I'm not going to be exposed in a Mel Gibsonian way
2049000	2053720	I am I am however confessing to you that like like something that is
2055080	2061000	Fundamental to all of this that like the the more innocent you are of any crime at all
2061200	2065400	The more important it is that you have this conversation with yourself
2065960	2068040	Right, right, you know this week
2069000	2073480	Like because I'm saying that and I'm saying that to you in the same way I would say
2074000	2077780	Cut out carbs or fucking like drink glass or something like that
2077780	2082400	I had discovered like like I think this is the time and
2082880	2091720	It is not because I know better than you it is because I like I'm going like shit you guys like like
2092720	2101440	We have the capacity to do things that we don't know we're doing and and we like we are going to benefit as brothers
2101440	2104680	We're not going to be less masculine and we're not going to be less cool
2104680	2106680	And we're not going to make less of a paycheck
2107080	2109400	Like there will be no real world
2110840	2116520	Consequences even amongst each other if we if we push toward it being fashionable to
2117000	2119000	Not
2119000	2124800	create a divider in between the conversations that we have with ourselves each other and and with women and
2125520	2128540	It's been nice like this summer camp thing for me for a while
2128540	2135200	I said like there's a lake in between the boys camp and the girls camp and it's very fun the idea like and with that comes
2135960	2137960	panty raids and
2138640	2144140	Which is awful which is terrible all of the shit from our 80s movies all awful
2145100	2153340	Guys, but it's like you've just broken into our place and started going through our personal items and taking them away from us
2155060	2156180	And
2156180	2158700	And we don't we can't do anything about it
2158700	2163420	But here's the logic circuit that gets triggered in you when we when we talk about this stuff because I know it gets triggered in
2163420	2170060	Me it it's like oh, what are you suggesting? What are you proposing? What are we supposed to do?
2170060	2173740	So I'm supposed to do this, but if we do that, but if everyone does this
2173740	2175740	But what about that?
2175820	2182300	Stop like it is not there is no invitation here and no command and no lecture
2182300	2187540	It is a tag cloud. It is tagging something and becoming more aware of it making it more
2187980	2189980	organizeable I
2190300	2195900	myself Dan Harmon with no expectation of anyone else and no prediction of
2196380	2198380	What will happen and with no?
2199140	2200900	Observation about how society works
2200900	2207740	I am saying and I feel like from my pull of one here with my best friend that
2208420	2210420	We're all in it right now
2210700	2217900	Like I am saying as one of you having that conversation in his head like like like all we have to do first is
2219260	2225100	Is is go back over our whole fucking life and and and
2225580	2228180	No, and you never have to put it in a journal
2228180	2232980	You don't have to issue a press release. You don't have to call anybody and say you're sorry
2233060	2235860	You do just but you there will be no
2237140	2240460	You can you can Welch on this after you agree to do it
2240460	2247500	Just open your panel if you're over 30 go back go back to like 10 or 8 and just kind of just
2247500	2250420	Or just you know, you don't have to do that. You're not combing a beach
2250420	2254900	You know that these fucking moments have charged to them your moments with women your
2255220	2262720	Relationships the moment of your conquest the moment of your defeat the moment of when you realize so-and-so was a bitch the moment you
2262720	2263900	realize
2263900	2269620	That you didn't want this but you prefer that and you're kind of into that any any moments that are charged with sexuality
2270020	2274420	Just pop back over to them. They're like marked on your little sci-fi map
2274500	2282460	They're marked with fucking they're marked and go back to them and just and just just relive them and and and and say
2283820	2287820	Man if I did that right now in front of me, I
2288620	2290540	Would say to me?
2290540	2293580	Okay. Hey here. Listen, that's not fair
2293580	2300660	Yeah, or whatever you'd say like here's what here's what your current me shouldn't be saying you pieces you fucking jerk off
2300660	2303180	You don't know the rules you piece of shit. Fuck you
2303540	2309100	Don't you know fucking chicks like it this way now like that guy is not a hero like I'm saying your real self
2309100	2315340	That's like oof. Oh fuck. I didn't know I didn't know I was I didn't know I wouldn't know what I was doing
2315340	2322620	It's embarrassing because you look at it and you go how could I not know? How could you not know that that was wrong?
2323060	2327900	It's just you know, it's it's it's very similar to what I went through with just
2328420	2330780	Stop eating meat, you know the click in your head
2331140	2336020	Even just forget am I doing like I'm not to gain say you like like forget about the word wrong
2336500	2341260	Because then it like creates this dichotomy of like there's a perfect way to be I'm saying that that's it
2341260	2347940	It's like what what with your meat eating you're not running around telling everybody not to eat meat, but it's hard
2347940	2354340	But I want to but but well, but but you live by example and you express yourself and you go like I didn't eat meat today
2354340	2357500	Whatever the fuck you don't like run around it hit people on the head with a brick
2358180	2360100	I'm just saying
2360180	2365640	That's not my point at all. I know I know you can be evangelical what you're not meeting. It's okay. It's okay
2367180	2369180	like
2369580	2376540	Awareness that's where I'm starting. Yeah, I'm embarrassed. I'm 44. I've spent a really long time
2377700	2383580	thinking about women as being and a huge portion of that time has been my feminist
2384260	2386260	Phase
2386420	2396340	Which just means that I've recognized that there's a different protocol like but the entire time was like there's a division
2397300	2403500	Sometimes it's a it's a wall over which I'm handing care packages. Sometimes it's a wall over, you know back in my 20s
2403500	2407180	I'm lobbying like M 80s over it and dead frogs to get a scream
2408020	2413700	Then then it's like I'm drilling a hole in it because I'm a hero this wall should come down
2413700	2417300	I don't like there's a wall there. Like I I
2418300	2424060	It has been there forever like and it it's like I'm sorry about that
2424060	2427860	I feel remorse for that and I'm like I'm trying to like
2430820	2432820	Like like
2433540	2435540	Notice when I like
2436420	2439820	When I'm saying shit because it's the easy thing to say
2440060	2446220	and when and when and because it's the next thing that you should say and when and when it's the next thing you should say in
2446220	2447460	order to
2447460	2453300	keep your job or make yourself more comfortable or feel good or all this stuff like it's
2454660	2459380	It's it's it's it's time to just sort of start thinking ergonomically about that stuff
2459380	2464620	Yeah, and and you guys there are 25 like okay, so Spencer and leave you're sitting here. Let's let's
2466140	2468140	Okay, okay
2468820	2470660	32 is the new 25
2470660	2474500	The the how old are you guys? What are you 20 28 28?
2475140	2478300	All right now now now tell us everything
2479100	2485860	Right. It turns out women are people. Yeah, see no, I don't know. I'm roadie smug. Well any old
2486220	2488220	That was that was a way you wanted
2489780	2491780	I wanted you to talk for 40 minutes
2492740	2496820	I mean, I guess when I have these conversations with friends, it's always it always comes back to just
2497900	2501020	Socialization and you know through the through the decades
2501420	2506260	The American way was like women stay in the kitchen and they raise the kids their pets
2507660	2511780	Essentially, I mean, that's what it is. Yeah companion and then oh, yeah
2511780	2515940	And then but that's not how anybody in this room or anybody that we've talked as ever say
2515940	2518500	It's easy to go like the idea that women should stay in the kitchen. No, no, no
2518780	2520780	No, that's our parents
2522020	2527060	But like take my like conservative grandmother for instance, like hmm, she's cool with like
2527940	2530420	Everyone getting work and whatever but what's her name?
2534300	2541060	Judy Judy Judy Judy Levy. No leaving Lebedski Lebedski. I'm not calling her out
2541060	2544380	I mean, she's just she grew up in it. Oh, sorry. You probably didn't want to
2545300	2549540	I grew up in a time where like, you know, there was a certain expectation and
2551140	2557500	You know, like I think my grandfather said this weekend like women went to college just to get married and
2557940	2564140	She was like that's not sure I got a really great education. It just so happens. That was a place that most women
2565500	2570420	Met men and got married and then ultimately didn't pursue work
2570420	2574540	But just the idea that like my grandfather in his head is like, yeah
2574540	2578580	Well women just that's the only reason they were going to college. I don't know. It's just
2579300	2584000	like those conversations I like those are then then we're in this ditch of like
2585020	2590780	Unsolvability and all this stuff. No, I think what you're saying, I mean, I'm not I'm not I'm not poo-pooing on what you're expressing
2590780	2596780	I'm like, I'm yes and again going yet. This is the thing that like distracts us is the is the conversations about
2597340	2600240	How society works like in a nuts-and-bolts way
2601020	2602500	like
2602500	2604820	How far are you into a conversation about?
2605300	2607300	being conscious of other people
2607300	2613660	before it immediately gets like it's like two or two sentences before you're talking about who opens the car door and who pays for the
2613820	2620380	For a dinner and we and minimum wage and and all this stuff which actually like ties everything in a giant knot and you know
2620380	2622380	forward but
2622460	2627380	It's it's all about progress and I think that this particular type of conversation change
2627380	2632860	it changes that conversation and and like, you know, this is such a trying time that I think that
2634100	2635780	It's hurting
2635780	2639260	certain areas and I think that you know, hopefully this
2640340	2646980	We move forward and it's and and things get uncomfortable people avoid it and they go. I don't want to hear it
2646980	2651660	It's fine. The way it is. Nobody wants to be wrong. Yeah, I'm wrong about everything. I'm wrong about everything
2651660	2656100	I've been wrong about everything my whole life. Oh god. Oh god, you're wrong. Did you hear did you hear what he said?
2656100	2658620	He said he's wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. You got this wrong
2658620	2660340	You use the wrong word use the wrong thing
2660340	2664980	like that's the other thing that we're like sick of hearing about how we forgot the rust belt and that's like now we have a
2664980	2669060	Nazi in the White House because apparently some fucking redneck somewhere got tired of being ignored. I
2669500	2674900	Everything we do is wrong. We go. We're wrong if we're being right too much. We're wrong, but like we're all
2675460	2681220	Yeah, I just like fucking like I'm I'm 44 and I'm like I'm wrong about everything. I'm always wrong
2681660	2685700	And it's like like isn't that a good like if you woke up and said like I'm wrong
2685700	2691780	I'm gonna be wrong today. I'm still I was wrong yesterday. I'm gonna be wrong more today and like like I
2693340	2696980	Why is it that when a woman comes into my
2698460	2700460	Wrongness and says
2701220	2704900	Maybe this and that's like I have an increased tendency to go like well
2704900	2708900	I don't know about that, but I'm just saying I'm wrong like like I have fucking
2709620	2716140	Issues and I have like like shit that I need to like like grease and loosen and pull apart
2716140	2717660	Do you want to ask a woman?
2717660	2721860	Ask a woman. I don't want to ask a woman anything. No, I think that there's like, you know
2721860	2723260	the hippie counterculture
2723260	2730700	Introduced this concept where like no one that anyone says is true and anyone that anyone tells you is the establishment trying to force a new
2731420	2740180	Hegemony on you and that opened the door for basically saying that anything that science anything that anyone has told you this fact is biased
2740180	2747700	And is trying to sell you something which kind of opened up the door for what we understand to be hippie stuff, you know yoga meditation
2748260	2749220	crystals
2749220	2753300	Sex cults like all this stuff kind of grew out of alternative
2754100	2759300	non-scientific ways of trying to understand the world and it kind of gained steam and power and
2759620	2762260	Became this countercultural thing and that grew into
2762740	2768380	Like there's bodies of facts to support any position and there's a book on this and a book on ghosts
2768380	2775340	And then it kind of gives the idea that completely non-scientific kind of non-intellectual things can have the auspices of
2775900	2777900	intellectuality and kind of the responsible
2778580	2786100	credibility of something that's real and that kind of created a world where people can feel comfortable just being right all the time and
2786180	2793460	creating new systems that create ways for that they're right and so everyone's kind of ensconced themselves in these silos of thinking that have kind
2793460	2799700	Of just existed concurrently and not ever butted into each other and that the field because the feeling of being wrong
2799700	2804460	It means that you can't charge for charge anyone money to be wrong, right?
2804500	2809940	You can charge somebody money to be right and and and and I think it's American to you you you go
2809940	2814060	Like it's like like there's no reward for saying. I don't know. I don't know. I
2814900	2817420	Think I got that wrong. I don't know
2817420	2817740	Yeah
2817740	2823340	I think in like the Middle East people will get a lot more mad and get into arguments in another countries people be more
2823420	2826260	Comfortable with stuff like that, but I think specifically in America
2826260	2832260	We have this discomfort with with really butting up against people and having these outward political debates
2832260	2839100	I mean until very recently because it's kind of exploded. Yeah, I mean that's what feels like it's like there's always like yeah
2839820	2841820	Man like like like like
2841900	2847260	It's my nightmare to be stupid and to be wrong and be talking out of my ass and all this stuff like I want to go
2847260	2852980	Back and I want to start this podcast over again. I was a fucking babbling idiot. Like you don't want to have listened to it
2852980	2857540	I I I I I'll try better next week, but like if I
2859620	2862580	I'm already wrong. I'm wrong. So then what do you do?
2862580	2867620	Like you like why and so my therapist is saying like it's time. Did I explain this?
2868940	2871180	I'm not making any sense like where it's like
2871420	2877020	Here's how I perceive the world working when a human being like walks around and okay, so I'm gonna walk
2877020	2882140	I'm gonna see a all right, so say something to me. Hi there, sir. How you doing?
2882540	2886720	Okay, so I just heard the words. Hi there, sir. How you doing? There's a guy in the sidewalk
2886720	2891820	so that that those facts went into my my head and now I
2892260	2897900	Envision them as going down a pipe through my face down my neck and then at my chest level
2898180	2904140	Above my solar plexus but right right at the top right between my neck and right like right between my nipples
2904460	2907020	There's a there's a like a box
2907460	2915340	it's a square box that all the information for my ears and eyes goes into and it this is the first stop that it goes into
2915340	2920180	and it's like it's it's I don't I
2921140	2926500	I'm scared to call it society or it's just like they're Freudian terms
2926500	2929560	I think maybe that it's it's it's it's it's it's experience
2930020	2935780	The super you nurture let's call it nurture versus nature, but that's that that's a that's distracting too
2936900	2943380	It's a construct. Yeah, it's what you've acquired norms. It's it's it's socialization. It's stored
2944220	2945860	processing
2945860	2947860	programming that you have assembled
2947980	2954420	Because there probably is on some psychological level the equivalent of a metabolism and it probably saves time to not have to think about
2954420	2959340	a bunch of shit implicit bias to not have to learn to tie your shoes every morning to
2959660	2965540	Not have to wonder what wood is and realize that it used to be trees
2965540	2971220	But so you can continue making your deck you have to go. I guess I'm making it now. It's not like amnesia, but
2971820	2976820	Anyways, it's the shit that you you've you've you've accepted as fact, right?
2977660	2978660	and
2978660	2985020	Like we are so advanced now that that information if you're living in a city and someone comes up to you and says
2985300	2987300	What Rob just said hello?
2988100	2995820	It goes into a box and like of course. There's a hello back like that's like the first thing in there
2995820	2999380	There's there's a million things based on whatever you're perceiving
3000020	3004820	Most importantly it never I feel like I have arranged in my body
3005380	3010820	That box is above another optional box which has to do with me like learning shit
3011220	3019260	Where I am like vulnerable where I am wondering what's going on the the baby the the guy that's like
3019820	3023340	Well, I don't know so let's find out what the fuck is that what's going on?
3024180	3028940	That and we have like I I I am using my I statements
3030460	3032460	Like I
3032540	3040100	Have such a hard time getting to that person like like the shoebox of fucking options up here is so
3040820	3044820	Like it there's getting to the person that said hey, how are you doing today?
3045660	3048500	Getting to the headline it could be a headline about
3049140	3052140	78 people getting shot in a mass shooting it could be a
3053140	3058500	Some of my friends saying I've just turned vegan. I don't want to eat meat anymore. Yeah, it's it's cruel
3058500	3062940	I could be someone saying I'm Muslim it could be someone saying your friend
3062940	3068220	Glenn just sexually harassed me at the carnival last night, and you're still friends with him, and it hurts my feelings
3068220	3071260	It could be did you watch Big Bang Theory? It could be?
3072180	3076820	Here's how you install a backsplash for your sink any information that comes into you like
3077700	3080380	Everything all of your experience. I'm just saying I I
3081100	3083100	I
3083100	3087460	Like I think there are two boxes. I think I'm an unconscious person
3087460	3093340	Well, I think that that second box is like maybe like core values and beliefs and stuff that kind of form
3093340	3097060	I don't know like our religiosity our you know
3097540	3101020	Attitudes towards authority and like that really forms our core identity
3101020	3107780	But that is definitely part of knowing traffic laws and piracy laws and stuff and it's like it is that stuff is important
3107860	3112420	But that stuff isn't who we truly are so like I definitely think there are these two
3112700	3118280	Two kinds of things that we and one of them is mostly unconscious. I think we had that one
3119420	3121980	Neuroscientist lady on and she was talking about implicit bias
3121980	3127720	But I think that that like bias comes a lot from these these core values that just form our base
3127900	3133060	Identity and are kind of like world are like like perspective just when we were growing up
3133180	3139180	You know our privilege and stuff like that's all just formed from these core truths that we understand that come from
3139300	3144400	Privilege because the core truths of like a white male are gonna be way different than the core truths from like a black
3144420	3149300	You know girl growing up in a in a neighborhood with you know police presence all the time
3149380	3153420	So it just kind of it kind of but there you can change it
3153420	3155500	I think it's just a lot harder because they are
3155660	3159900	These core values that we recognize are important to our sense of identity
3159900	3165580	And I think we're in a world that like figuring out our identity and what side we're on and whether we're cool with that
3165580	3170020	Or whatever is becoming something that maybe media our culture is kind of hyper
3170620	3175180	Hyperizing like kind of whipping into a froth weaponizing probably for marketing purposes
3175180	3178820	But it's like becoming more of a thing where you have to pick a site whereas
3178820	3182620	I don't think you used to you just be able to like oh well. How about that?
3182620	3186740	Did you hear about that Wow you know and now it's like I'm okay with that
3186820	3190060	I'm not gonna be okay with that should I be okay with that
3190060	3194500	I think I'm okay with that unless someone has any reason why I shouldn't be and I don't know
3194500	3199740	I think it just is like we're more prime to either accept I think I think but the thing the thing that I think is
3199740	3203020	Real interesting about this conversation is like traditionally
3204340	3209820	You know the older you get the more you get set in your ways, and you know there's a hundred stand-up
3210820	3214060	References to like the the forwards you get from your
3214540	3222220	Your uncle or or your your parents saying all this racist stuff or what a class of stuff like it's just because that's how they
3222220	3223340	Were raised and they're not learning
3223340	3229580	But what you're going through Dan and what what I'm going through and what it seems like the world our generation is going through
3229580	3233300	Is we're kind of looking to back and going we were wrong back
3233300	3235420	I know you don't want to say wrong with the ceiling way
3236220	3238700	I look back and I go yeah
3238700	3243580	There was a time where I was like no women are the enemy and they deserve it
3243580	3246460	And I'm gonna be on the guy side because women judge
3247020	3252680	Me and say yes or no to me and anybody in a position of power is got to be evil
3252680	3256540	So they deserve whatever blah blah blah blah blah blah and I've thought that way
3257260	3263980	Most of my life because I'm the underdog I don't deserve this and why can't it be easier for me?
3263980	3271380	And that's my fault and it's shitty and I yeah because how many ways did you fucking bothered a second-guess the system?
3271380	3276660	Yeah, you know when they told you not to cut school when they told you not to be as into Jackie Chan bootleg
3277020	3282340	Videos when they told you Dungeons and Dragons wasn't cool when they you know, it's like we're so fucking it's like you pick and
3282340	3289100	Choose which which area of which feels right and sometimes when it feels right, it's just avoiding the truth
3289100	3292100	But the other side of that is like as soon as I start saying that I know
3292220	3295180	Cuz it's like they start going what wait, what are you saying?
3295540	3300700	Like who do I you don't owe anybody anything? You don't you don't no one's gonna take your pants
3300700	3304980	You know, they're not gonna lose any trail mix. There's not gonna be any less teeth under your pillow tomorrow. I
3305500	3311020	That's where I that's how we're used to processing things like someone's coming for my fucking shit
3311180	3315400	So if you if you let that guy spit on you at recess tomorrow
3316000	3319440	You know he and you don't do something about it
3319440	3322520	Like he's gonna spit on you twice as much as he spits on
3323560	3327080	Toby Richards cuz Toby Richards, you know what he did. He fucking kicked him in the nuts
3327080	3333460	He's still got his ass kicked, but he didn't get spit on anymore. Like logic logic logic logic. Slippery slope hierarchy logic logic logic
3334920	3339720	Dan when did your podcast stop being funny when your mama fucking slurped on my giant knob?
3340720	3345800	III already warned you about this. Okay. I just want to address that one more time voice in my head
3345800	3347800	I'm just saying I understand I
3348360	3353240	Spent the weekend inadvertently going through YouTube clips of like when my podcast is really funny
3353240	3357920	A lot of times Rob's on when that's happening. That's true. Um, so I thought I'd invite him back tonight
3358560	3360560	boy, I'm really really
3361680	3367340	Doing that I don't I don't I tell all I could tell you is like when like like
3368840	3370840	The funny the funny is happening
3371640	3376840	It doesn't have to be funny when I'm not losing my mind and we're not losing our mind when when there's not shit going on
3376840	3382360	It's just like, you know, we just mark these occasions you click on this when you go. Oh, that must have been when the Rosma
3384520	3386760	Giefen was doing that thing on the Twitter
3387560	3396200	But anyways, I do when those aliens were founded Roz McGowan. I want to I can't I want to say one thing about about about Rose
3397160	3401640	Aka Joan of Arc right now because there's this awesome thing happening which
3403920	3406720	Like Twitter was used to get a
3407840	3414840	President elected that in a way that really bummed us out because leading up to that the accepted thing was that Twitter couldn't accomplish anything
3414840	3421200	real that was worth any change and for it to get like hacked whether you use that term like
3422120	3424280	literally or not, but like for it to be I
3425240	3432040	Unfairly or not for it to be used as a real-world tool to just affect real change for the bad guys was like
3432640	3438400	Really demoralizing. Yeah, especially for people like me who grew up on the internet
3438400	3442360	We thought we created as a place to hide from really awful people
3442920	3443920	asterisk
3443920	3446600	Per our other conversation. We're finding out that that entire time
3446600	3449760	We were also awful people because we fantasize about being Han Solo who's a piece of shit
3449760	3455560	All right, but the but then this is why even though
3456560	3459600	it's like a kind of like nice book into this thing because now we're
3460080	3463560	This is the this is the second time since the election of that
3464440	3466000	parasite that
3466000	3472520	What's happening on Twitter as soon as I mentioned it to my therapist? She knows what I'm talking about and shit's happening
3473040	3475040	There's a court of public opinion
3475040	3480600	How that got leveraged on Twitter that was used to create real-world results that like heads
3480920	3485960	Rolled down the physical street with the potatoes. It wasn't like cancel Colbert
3486200	3493360	Nothing happens because first of all, what are you doing? Second of all, he's at blah blah blah the world just continuing to like
3494160	3500400	Circulate while Twitter acts like there's something that can be done. It was like this feels like
3501240	3508840	Exhilarating, but the funny thing about it is that it feels exhilarating in a way that feels like the fire is outside my front porch
3509480	3516080	Did did she get was her Twitter account like is it like she got suspended cuz she is it back. I mean I
3517920	3521200	Yeah, I haven't read the last thing I heard while
3521720	3523720	This is actually why I wanted to bring it up
3523720	3529080	It's an anecdotal thing that made me want to just say one thing as long as I'm not being funny like to the extreme
3529640	3534100	like there was a recent thing that just happened that I was hearing about like
3534640	3537920	While getting ready to take my girlfriend's dad to dinner, which was like
3540360	3543200	She'd said something that it crossed
3544040	3550840	Racial line and she was trying to reach for an allegory to help whatever and then there was flat blowback flashback
3551680	3557680	The white back black black like black flashback of the click-clack like like like it exploded
3557800	3563400	It got fucked up and and I and I like halfway through hearing about it. I just wanted to like like
3566640	3572960	Isn't this what we've been doing for like 15 years like like we keep on like like cool shit starts happening
3572960	3575840	And then like the bad guys don't they don't have this
3576880	3583940	they don't have this obstacle in their path where everything like where like we we hold we hold our
3584020	3589100	Our people who are who are helping us like and making us have conversations
3589100	3593220	like we hold them to the to the standard of as if they're supposed to
3593940	3601780	Like be some kind of like historical figure that gets everything right or and then to the extent that any our standard for
3602020	3604020	ignoring leaders
3604060	3606060	Has become oh
3606900	3610380	Did we then find out they're not perfect meanwhile the bad guys?
3611060	3614120	They they're just beating us because they don't have that standard
3614700	3615780	They don't care
3615780	3618680	You can be a Republican that does not believe at all in
3618900	3625300	Mexicans being rapists and just wants to gain financially and you can you can belong to a party where you go like yeah
3625300	3627340	But I don't I don't I don't care that he said that
3628140	3629220	Who gives a shit?
3629220	3636340	I want my money and I'm going to get my money by pretending I don't give a shit what he says and the good guys are
3636340	3637580	like
3637620	3642820	Fucking a yes down with the patriarchy like let's do this one thing and then and then
3643340	3646460	We we have that was that hero worship thing
3647500	3654660	It's like can't you just can't you can't you give a woman that's that that stands up for a second a fucking break?
3654660	3660220	I like like they're not it happened so quickly. It's always it's gonna happen. It's always gonna happen quickly
3660220	3666820	Yeah, it's like like there's always gonna be tinder and fucking like not the app the actual thing that we use to start fires
3666940	3671060	There's always gonna be it. There's always gonna be it. She wasn't running for senator
3671420	3672820	like like
3672820	3674580	Emily Gordon like
3674580	3678900	Retweeted a link to a thing and I don't know who wrote it. I only know it's like I like it was a years ago
3680740	3684900	And the the articles headline was admit it your fave is problematic
3685700	3689580	Which and I was like, what is that gibberish? I read the articles like saying
3690780	3692780	if you keep holding your
3693180	3697260	The people you admire to to to to a standard of political
3698060	3700060	minute-to-minute like
3702500	3704500	Perfection like then you're
3704500	3707660	You're fucking them. I mean, it's it's the the FBI
3708060	3713980	monitored Martin Luther King to make sure as like they're like, oh man the minute that guy gets a blowjob then like
3714740	3717840	Then we don't have to care about black people anymore. Is that fair?
3718000	3724120	Those that's what we're doing to each other now when we when we when we we just we just have to like
3724120	3726120	Can we loosen the fucking?
3727480	3732440	Why am I why am I calling the action there's nothing that a biomass can do that's just a sad
3733000	3734800	Side effect of oppression too
3734800	3742440	It's like that's what the system does is it pits the small dogs against each other and tells them that that's what they should be
3742440	3748800	Doing otherwise, they don't have the moral authority to overthrow real oppressors killing people and robbing families
3748800	3751520	You know, I mean, I'm not saying that you're wrong to bring it up
3751520	3754560	It's just like that is a that's a part of the system and it's fucked
3754560	3760880	But like but there's a double standard here too, right if you if you were to draw a gender line only because one gender has privilege
3761880	3768280	I sound like a college student that in 1992 that that that women
3769240	3773000	Uniting without doing it in a cigar smoke-filled room
3773880	3776800	Because why would it happen there? How would it happen there?
3777400	3785180	If you're in a handmaid's tale, where are you gonna meet except the produce aisle? You ain't got no fucking Freemason Lodge that the
3788600	3795160	Unprivileged movements have the total disadvantage of being open source, right and
3795880	3802640	Trolls and hecklers and people that just like peer in if it's if it's a movement worth its salt
3802640	3806400	If it's good honest people that are like, well, we don't have anything to hide
3806400	3811960	So we're not gonna meet in a fucking catacomb and plot the destruction of something that should get me in the electric chair
3811960	3819040	I'm gonna like this is a movement that's going to catch fire among the people and it's like but we live in this flame retardant
3819480	3825600	It's so unfair you go like oh women are oh look the women are saying they're hashtagging this or that and then it's like
3825600	3828600	Oh, well that that should put a pretty high premium on
3829160	3834000	Dividing them amongst each other and and that'll go to shit pretty quick and then I can start laughing
3834000	3839600	I got like jeez, I wonder how come you guys don't have rights? Yeah, sure can't get along with each other
3840040	3846100	Meanwhile, I'm not off to my men's meeting like I don't like men and I can say that nothing will happen to me
3846820	3848820	Men men are dumb. Oh
3851780	3854060	Hey, you know what I don't like that kind of man
3854060	3858460	That's like what he's that that's like all about selling himself sexually
3858460	3864180	I think I think I think that person should be ashamed of himself like I'm not gonna suffer any fucking blowback for that
3864180	3865900	There's no
3865900	3870220	Among in some men's like it's because like we don't care
3870740	3877380	That's also not fair. So when if if if if someone awesome like Rose McGowan like
3887300	3888980	Going
3888980	3895780	If she's going if the thing that's like catching fire is that she's fucking taking no guff, you know
3896020	3902820	Yeah, I like like you see all the our old-timers like are piping up and they're going like it's it's funny
3902820	3907440	Cuz I think you go like oh, I'm 20 years out from being that. Yeah tone deaf. There you go
3908500	3912620	Hmm, but but I love a stone. Yeah. Um, no listen ladies
3913220	3919080	If something should offend your sensibilities simply give it time. There's a due process for this
3920100	3922100	chose to
3922740	3929260	Chime in he goes this is this is probably the best time it would people want to hear what I think it would be a shame
3929260	3931260	yes, if
3931940	3939340	You would think he would know the room better than anybody but he like what if somebody like said, hey, mr
3939340	3943200	Allen, it looks like you're enjoying your coffee. What do you think about all this crazy stuff?
3943700	3946660	No comment. Leave me alone. I'm old and
3947180	3951460	It's it's done. That's the other thing. That's the difference with the Woody Allen thing is I feel like
3952940	3953580	I
3953580	3962420	that's that is totally possible that somebody literally like like just said that much and that he and that like his quote with the one
3962420	3964100	that I heard which is like I
3964100	3967660	Hope it doesn't turn into a witch hunt if you plaster it on
3968340	3972660	Times Square in a scroll and it feels like he issued a press release
3972660	3976100	Well, he should have been like this like an Alan Greenspan hoping we don't over invest
3976900	3983580	Like like like or is it it could also be him getting into a cab and going I don't want I
3983900	3985220	Hope it doesn't
3985220	3989940	That could be an almost honest thing for him to say. Well, the last thing I need is for that to
3990620	3992660	Become a trend again. Oh boy
3993220	3995220	Hey
3995420	3998060	This is the things you know, you don't know the context
3998060	4002260	All I know is that he it didn't sound like something he was saying on the weight of the car
4002260	4004700	like I don't want it didn't sound like I
4005300	4009660	Don't really want to talk about this. I know you want to comment from me
4010900	4014300	You know, I mean he could have easily said
4015140	4017500	It's awful. I wish it didn't happen
4018980	4020980	And then go away
4021260	4023300	buddy, he
4023300	4025860	opened his mouth and put both of his feet in and
4026780	4028820	Just was like you read it you go
4028980	4036020	What did you think was good you are whether you think you did it or didn't do what you did?
4036460	4038460	you know what people the
4039140	4044560	Public probably thinks about you right now. So but but but but
4045500	4052780	We don't yeah, I don't like on that note the context wasn't here. This is all circling back to like what and and then so
4054380	4057940	Rose let's just get on a first-name basis whether so I stopped
4058900	4060900	saying her last name
4061780	4069300	Well, she's like fuck it whatever like like really every fucking tweet has to be on fucking point and
4069900	4071900	and I like
4073660	4078980	We're gonna win that game if we play the game of does everybody have to say everything right and that's exact
4078980	4084940	I know how confusing that can be for people because we're talking about like fucking like don't take this shit anymore
4084940	4090140	Don't take anybody's big. They're gonna cloak it in language. They're gonna say they're gonna say
4090140	4092420	That's the way things work and all this stuff and like so
4092900	4098340	Yeah, you know what? I'm hearing myself say it out loud now. I'm like pirouetting back to like what the fuck am I why?
4098340	4100340	Is this my impulse to explain?
4100780	4104340	Let me let me take another run at that and do it the way that's healthy
4104820	4106860	When I heard that Rose
4107580	4110520	McGowan nice was catching shit
4110880	4115120	Mm-hmm because she made did or didn't like
4115400	4122120	Put her toe over a foul line on that on whatever bowling lane you perceive like it it bummed me out
4122760	4128240	Because I it makes me feel like we will never gain
4129360	4134160	traction organically that we will create a world in which the only way to
4134160	4141240	Change things and and and accumulate power is to do so artificially and therefore
4142320	4144320	reduce the risk of
4145000	4149580	Infraction along the way. I but do you think do you think with?
4150800	4157160	With with something like when when Rose starts saying something and yes, she's abrasive
4157160	4163280	but she's angry and she wants to be listened to so of course she's gonna be passionate about this stuff that happened to her and
4163440	4167260	And and so whatever and then Twitter locks her down
4167260	4170020	I mean doesn't that seem like
4170640	4176520	That's a fear-based thing like no we got a it's like if somebody if a prisoner is running for the wall
4176520	4177760	You know
4177760	4184120	Every every guard is gonna start shooting at it because we can't let that one prisoner get over the fence
4184120	4190080	Yeah, but if every but all these other prisoners if they're just like they're not gonna be they're just if you just stay
4191040	4196280	Inside the prison and don't run right right right. Oh, so yeah, I mean yeah, yeah
4196280	4203960	No, I think I know okay, which is yeah, but I'm saying I'm saying like is like because we're pushing this stuff down
4203960	4208840	Oh, I don't know. I guess when I say we were when when the world is like
4209480	4214160	Pushing this stuff down. It's like no we don't want to change. We don't want to be told we're wrong
4214880	4216440	You're wrong
4216440	4223200	Yes, do I think that it is harder for revolutionaries to say anything that affects people?
4223200	4225200	Yes, like it's like so
4225640	4232680	Parabolically stacked against people and so then do I but that's that's that's it's a sign of like the status quo is afraid
4232680	4234940	Yeah of this happening
4235960	4237960	That's good because
4240000	4244320	Oil that drives the engine of change is the blood of martyrs
4244960	4250240	But just to go back to my point that I was making before is like the generation our parents
4250400	4253080	have never been more at least from my
4253760	4259820	Point of view have never been more doubled down and and dug into no no no
4259820	4266240	yeah, he didn't do anything worse than Clinton and I love our president and he's into Jesus Christ and and
4266880	4273240	And I just ignore all these horrible things that he does because he's better than Hillary the murderer Hillary who?
4273440	4276040	Pizzagate Hillary, she's better than that
4276680	4279440	And we're all gonna be rich someday just like him
4280120	4282120	And he's one of us
4282240	4288680	So I'm gonna ignore all that but like you and I like right now like at our age
4289400	4297040	I mean, we're we're going through like changes. We're becoming I'm not saying that we're better than anybody
4297040	4298760	but I think
4298760	4300760	the one good thing about
4301560	4303560	Like the social media stuff
4303920	4310440	for me just in terms of like what's happening now and my how I feel about like eating meat and and and
4310840	4319400	not and animal rights and things like that and just people rights and and just being good and it it I think that
4319680	4327160	That's the one thing that I think is good is that like at our age when we should be digging in and saying no
4327160	4329160	I wasn't wrong. We're still
4329640	4335960	Changing and evolving. So I'm trying to put a positive right, right? No, that's a good. Yeah, that's that's that's better than nothing
4335960	4341040	I also though. Yeah, I want but yeah, it makes you feel more helpless because how do you change the world?
4341040	4344800	I was want to acknowledge that like your your parents and my parents like
4345120	4348360	Like like when I was I was I was at an image in my head
4348360	4351640	we were talking about that and talking about like when we talked to our parents and like
4351960	4356600	How they talk about like whoa, you know when you get a sense of where they're at politically
4357080	4361680	My mom's fucking well, she probably wouldn't want me to expose her but she is
4363200	4367400	My mom's on fucking point my mom's my mom is like like crazy
4367400	4372240	Like like she's like she's she's down to clown on the on the left
4372240	4375440	But I think she's kind of like I don't wanna I don't wanna docks her
4376200	4380840	Politically, I don't know what's going on in her house. I don't know if her and my dad are fighting or what's going on
4380840	4383560	I don't wanna I don't wanna I've ruined my family with my mouth
4383560	4389760	I don't I want to let them have their lives but but talking about our parents is important because you you you I picture like
4389760	4391000	these like
4391000	4392760	like
4392760	4394520	these like
4394520	4399200	brick-bracks like like I picture your mom talking about politics and your dad is like
4399560	4401440	They're like in this like
4401440	4405760	Midwestern house and there's like little porcelain birds and there's these things that you grew up around
4406080	4411640	We're like who buys a porcelain bird and and the answer is someone who's got their shit together
4411960	4416480	But the whole time now that you and I are their age when they were talking to us
4418840	4424600	I'll speak for myself and say like now I have a house and even though it doesn't have a little porcelain birds in it
4424600	4428280	There's some equivalent of it. That's like a connection that I have to like. Oh
4428920	4430560	This could all go away
4430560	4431120	Yeah
4431120	4436880	And I think that it's hard for us to understand when we think about our parents in the Midwest in their little tract houses with their
4436880	4439600	porcelain birds and their and their Cuisinarts on there and
4439720	4441720	Everything's working great and then when they talk about
4442120	4444320	It needs to be like this or it doesn't need to be like that
4444320	4450440	like part of part of how it's easy to clown them is because it it seems so clear looking at them that they
4450960	4452760	Have nothing to worry about
4452760	4457960	And then as it's like well, what what kind of what kind of a bill we P Newton like world
4457960	4459960	Do you live in build that wall?
4461120	4463240	Mexicans don't get into Wisconsin
4463960	4470640	And that's what that did not affect your plans to watch CSI Miami tomorrow night or whatever like we laugh at them because we go
4470720	4474120	Yeah, but you're not in the real world because we're young city kids
4474120	4481080	Yeah, but we're young city kids who are now turning 45 and we're I I own my own home and for me
4481080	4484420	I'm like like now I have conversations with Duncan Trussell
4484420	4488480	He comes back from Burning Man and he starts laying into me with the like man
4488480	4493840	You gotta just let it go, baby. And I'm like, I do you like five years ago. I'd be like, yeah
4493840	4496560	You gotta let it go. Let's do you want to do acid next Wednesday?
4496560	4499840	Do you want it? Like let's talk like Obama's president
4499840	4504320	So let's talk about how properties theft and I'll fucking I'll blow your mind more than you could blow mine
4504320	4507880	but now for real like it's like oh, I
4508640	4514160	I I have a job and I have a five-bedroom house and he comes on
4514720	4519560	He I go on his podcast and he's like, yeah, but why don't you just let some people hang out here, man
4520200	4525320	Like and and I'm like, yeah, I totally should but seriously I can't do that. Yeah
4525320	4527800	I had a whole conversation with him where I was like
4528520	4531120	That's I'm my parents. Is your worried? I just
4532480	4539680	Everybody's I mean like they're worried people are worried about being taken advantage of you know, like just being I just got here
4539680	4545560	It's like the judge Reinhold fast times regiment high thing. But that's yeah, that's the thing like whenever anybody calls you
4546200	4549800	Privileged or it's a it's a the scene in fast times
4549800	4557040	I'm hanging on by a thread guidance counselor does this monologue to judge Reinhold who's still dressed in his fucking pirate fast food outfit
4557040	4560120	She says sorry, but it's time to enroll in a college
4560120	4565640	Like like I don't know where you've been with the the party's over and he's like you've just watched him the whole movie like
4565640	4569840	Just deliver fast food and he's like, I don't know. He does some mini monologue back
4569840	4572160	That's like fuck you that when did the party start or whatever?
4572600	4580160	That is how somebody that you wouldn't believe you're like you with your porcelain birds. Why are you talking about Liberty?
4580160	4583400	Why are you talking about anything? Yeah, why are you in this conversation?
4583400	4588760	Why aren't you just patriotic about porcelain birds like they're cheap. You get him at Home Depot
4589480	4591800	You already own them. You're not buying anything
4591920	4598480	You're watching a fucking television with America playing across it. You're almost dead. You save for your medical bills
4598480	4600920	Now they're gonna shoot them into you, but blah blah blah blah blah
4600920	4603880	Like we look at I look at older people and I judge them
4604120	4607600	Like like like why are they why do they have so much control over what's going on? I?
4609040	4616040	I get the feeling lately like 25 year olds see me that way that they that they think that
4616040	4620680	They're looking at what I have is more permanent than I am looking. Yeah. Yeah
4620680	4623760	I feel like I am five minutes from
4625160	4627160	Depending on which way the wind blows
4627160	4633600	One committee or another dressed in one color jumpsuit or another coming up to my door and saying
4634040	4637920	Like you didn't earn this house. You don't you don't get to have this
4637920	4642560	this is we're changing the name of this state where you you you you
4643160	4649480	We just found your name on a Google list that like we didn't know you were in defeat
4649720	4652120	Like that's that's that's a sign of
4653560	4660280	Isis now what I would are whether it was right wing left winged west wing or or young Sheldon I
4660680	4662680	Whatever hit show
4663000	4669440	It I I live constantly going like they're gonna come get me. Yeah, I think I feel that way
4669440	4674240	I think so. What if our parents feel that way? I'm sure they do feel that way. I mean that's because that's you know every
4675520	4677520	email from my
4677960	4680560	Relatives for is like look at what look what?
4681480	4685440	When Obama was president, you know, look what they're look what these people are doing, you know
4685440	4688000	We're gonna have to work hard and we're gonna have to pay for some
4688480	4690200	lazy
4690200	4692200	poor person
4692600	4695320	Their medical bills. Why should we do that? You know
4695840	4702800	and it's they're worried that they're gonna be taken advantage of I you know or
4703120	4710360	Their stuff being taken away. They're good. Their birds are gonna be taken away. Nobody wants your fucking birds. It's just it's
4710840	4712800	crazy because
4712800	4715280	my parents and my family are so
4716120	4722000	Religious they go to church like three times a week and it's one book
4722480	4729400	You know what haven't you read it already? What else are you gonna find out new about the Bible, you know, somebody
4729400	4734700	Oh, they just found some new discoveries found a couple new pages here. It looks like
4737400	4740880	Are not as holy as we thought that is fucking insane
4741680	4747160	now that we know there are people who have done a podcast where it's like 200 episodes of a podcast where their gimmick was they're
4747160	4749260	gonna watch grown-ups to every
4750440	4752680	We've demystified the idea of
4753640	4760040	Going through Star Wars one minute at a time the entire like trilogy and and all of the trilogies
4760040	4762960	And there's people still going to church
4763920	4769440	Every pretending like it's just such a big book and it's so complicated. Like I wonder what part we'll talk about
4769440	4778720	The last 10 years like oh don't my colleagues all are
4780480	4783120	I'm Joseph Campbell, so I'll stick up for Christianity
4783120	4787680	But like I said, yeah the American like Midwestern Church. Yeah, like culture where it's like
4789400	4794720	Ridiculous, we're pretending that we haven't had the chance to look through that. Yeah from cover to cover
4794720	4799880	Yeah, I mean come on. Some parts are boring. It's at the Old Testament does a lot of begats
4799880	4805000	Like I've tried going through this thing. Yeah, it's okay to say it's a boring book. It's also
4809120	4814160	It's a book that you haven't read that has huge boring parts that you could read and like not
4814360	4818800	Understand and then and then you go to a building and the guy says today. We're gonna talk about
4818800	4825160	What this thing this doesn't make any sense at all if you just read the words
4825560	4830000	If you read the words is beget in thou and about nobody talks like that
4830680	4832200	Nobody, you know
4832200	4837440	Nobody lives to be 500 and the cool ones are the ones that go like so here's what Jesus is saying
4837440	4839880	Just because it doesn't make any sense. What are you? It's like a
4840480	4844840	English teacher taking you through Macbeth Macbeth is saying hey be cool
4845440	4849480	You know, like and then we're all like whoa. Wow. Yeah, you do that for four years
4851560	4858520	You do that for four years in in high school and then you're done with it and then maybe you'll see the movie
4859040	4866480	But these people go every fucking week and really like should these say like, okay, listen, don't be a dick to each other
4866880	4872760	Class dismissed. Yeah, okay. We're taking the rest of the summer off. Don't be an asshole to each other
4872760	4876960	Well in my death, here's here's the here's the threat and that's why like yeah
4876960	4883320	I we saw Jesus Christ Superstar like like when we were like in our 20s and like I got really into it
4883320	4886760	I was like shit man. This is a great musical like I love these songs
4886760	4889040	Yeah, and then because the songs sounded so good
4889040	4894360	I like I started watching more discovery channel shows about Jesus and
4894640	4900080	Reading the stuff that Campbell said about Jesus and like I still haven't really gotten cover to cover through the New Testament
4900080	4905000	But I feel like I know Jesus a little bit better than a lot of people that get paid a lot of money to say
4905000	4910000	They know Jesus. Yeah, and that's the reason why I think because it's not a complicated myth. No
4910440	4915440	It's it's very nuanced. There's a lot of room for exploration and constant talk about it, but it is
4916040	4918040	pretty much die-hard
4918120	4924120	Except instead of being afraid to fly he's sort of afraid to die, right
4925200	4927800	and the Nakatomi Plaza is is
4928640	4930640	Sermon on the Mount
4930640	4932640	sure, I
4933480	4935480	Don't know. I don't know what the Bible
4937000	4940360	Wait, didn't you go through a biblical what you raised? No, I know the Bible. Yeah
4940360	4942800	No, I was what Rob was saying really quick
4942800	4946860	I think for the same reason as you is because I do encounter a lot of Christians and it's like wait
4946860	4952320	Don't I know more about the Bible than you and shouldn't I not know more about because there's a block
4952320	4955760	Yeah, they're not actually studying it. They're not studying it
4955760	4963880	They're they're told if you go to church every every Sunday and keep saying I believe in Jesus
4963880	4971760	I believe in Jesus when you die you get to have ice cream forever and your favorite television show will play on a loop
4971760	4978240	And you'll see all of your old pets and your family and you'll be able to hang out with Lincoln in heaven and stuff
4978240	4979320	Like that keep in mind
4979320	4985320	There's a Muslim version of all this stuff that you'll be laughing at when someone tells you they read on a bubblegum
4985320	4992760	Rapper that that's what they believe right and that's why the minute the minute, you know, the minute you you say like
4994080	4998880	Well, why don't you why don't you help the poor? I mean because
4999600	5004920	I mean isn't didn't God or Jesus say do unto others is you would do unto yourself
5004920	5009660	Wouldn't you help wouldn't you you're giving 10% of your paycheck to the church?
5010100	5014940	Why isn't the church full of homeless people during the other six days?
5014940	5019300	It's not being used why why it doesn't pay taxes
5019300	5026340	Why can't you why is really can't you give some of this money so we can all have affordable because everybody gets
5027140	5033660	Sick, everybody dies. Nobody wants to have their lead. What is it? Shouldn't you be going? Yes, take
5034500	5039780	All of our money popular thing Jesus ever said was sell all your stuff and follow me. Yeah
5040700	5042700	No, no one likes talking about
5043740	5047820	Want to give up their fucking bird, right? Neither did the rich man. He ran away sad
5047820	5053980	He went away sad because that I mean I I didn't I can't do it. I'm not I'm not I'm not killing anybody and
5054540	5059980	Because I don't know, you know, I said wouldn't it be nice to have a third Testament where it's or like or like a Mormon
5059980	5061980	It's like instead of this
5064300	5066500	I've stood in a microphone and said hey
5066500	5072660	I think capitalism might be the root of a lot of our problems that we're having like the idea that everything has a price seems
5072660	5080620	to keep trickling sideways over into these stories you scratch our heads about where the cost of a bullet is less than the cost of
5080620	5083900	Killing a black child. Yeah, like like it hasn't capitalism at its heart
5083900	5089940	Doesn't this what ends up getting us here and then you know, like like like the reddit the next day like well
5089940	5097540	If you hate capitalism so much what wouldn't we know that you meant that by you giving your house away and eating your own foot?
5097540	5104460	I I don't I what I would like is for a guy to come up to Jesus in the New Testament and say hey, listen
5104460	5110860	Yeah, must be nice. Mm-hmm son of God. Hey, I never said I was a son of God. Yeah, I heard that's your steak
5110860	5118460	Yeah, I'm not saying that you're you do keep saying that's what you said. I never said that I never said that but you are
5119100	5122220	Living a very rarefied life right now
5123500	5129820	Yes, I am but you know, I just do what I do
5134780	5139180	Because it's like what if you woke up the next day and you just fucking did that
5139180	5143920	What if you just calls it like you sees it walk around and the answer is according to that book
5144160	5147600	Some people will come up to you and say but I'm a police officer
5147600	5151260	What would you want me to do and you would say hey, man? What's police?
5151280	5157180	What's an officer and he would like drop his spear and like and like freak out and I'm not making fun of it
5157180	5158880	like I I
5158880	5162200	What if that's not the thing that's gonna change shit?
5162200	5168920	What is by the way encountering some dude who fucking blows your mind and there's you know, why can't the answer be I?
5169720	5171400	Don't know I
5171400	5178080	Have I worked my whole life. I've been told my whole life. So so you're saying like from the new Christ
5178160	5183120	Yeah, why can't the answer be? Hey, man, I'm not sure I don't know
5183120	5188520	I'm just trying to get by like everybody else and the answer is because it would be a decentralized non-hierarchical
5189280	5197120	like modern compliant myth about all of you instead of a protagonist in the story who's some dude that we're supposed to like
5197120	5200800	Be like and if we're not like him then we fucked up like that
5200800	5208040	It's just a story as it was originally intended. I would believe about what if you what if you just what if if you give a
5208040	5210920	Mouse a cookie. That's the Millennials that you know, all right
5211920	5214440	It's like like this idea like like, you know
5214440	5218000	What happens if you wake up one day and you start calling it like you sees it?
5218000	5221320	You only live to about 33 and then they nail you to a piece of wood
5221560	5225360	That's like that but you get to meet you get to meet David Bowie
5226000	5233320	Like like you you you you it beats prostate cancer. I don't know what to tell you Matt like like
5233920	5240800	Who else was crucified on Golgotha? Like what who are these other people? Did they snatch purses? Were they also God him?
5240800	5247840	Did they did they threaten rather the fate of Judea? I don't know what I what like like what I'm saying to you is yes
5247840	5254600	It's true. It's very true. If you were to start searching your conscience before you reacted to anything ever. It's true
5254600	5257680	Your path could be absolutely uncontrollably short
5257720	5262640	you could end up out of work on Wednesday and under a bridge on Thursday and not an
5263160	5268040	Intervention episode and you could just like be a pile of bones in a sewer next to Tim Curry dressed as a clown
5268560	5273160	Floating and and not but not even acknowledged in the final tally of who floats
5273160	5278560	Oh, okay, like when Tim Curry would say they all float he might exclude you just to add
5278560	5284240	I just want to make sure this is a nightmare scenario. I don't even want your bones in Tim Curry's float catalog, right?
5284600	5290040	When he says they all you'll float too. He's not talking about you. You'll just be you'll be bones
5290040	5292480	He didn't even know what if he's just starting out
5294080	5302040	You know, I mean he says yeah, you'll oh, sorry Timmy, you know what I said earlier you'd float too. I
5302480	5303560	meant
5303560	5310120	The royal you yeah, yeah the second person. We're hoping to get some others. I got a couple of other kids
5310120	5315560	It's like when uncle Sam says he wants you. He doesn't want you Timmy. Yeah, you might be if you had a flat feet
5315560	5321240	I just started out here whether you've shown or not depends largely on your methane content, right?
5321240	5326720	Your fear whatever you were afraid of if you're afraid of listen, it's raining. I'm getting pretty wet down here
5326720	5331000	Are you in on how you'll float? Are you gonna float to I mean that figuratively?
5331000	5334640	Yeah, it's not a litigatable phrase you'll float to yeah in or out
5334640	5342080	I I just I copper it wrote the the the slogan. I mean what the second kid it'll make sense
5342080	5344080	But you can you just oh?

5457420	5460020	So we don't have to play D&D and we could just wrap do you wanna do you want?
5460500	5467740	Kate to play D&D my wife loaded question after talking what how we should respect women for 90 minutes
5467740	5474900	She's really good at magic cards. We don't even have really good at magic. I mean I was tired of Kelly last night
5474900	5480700	Yes, she hasn't been playing that long if I understand, but really she's been kicking your ass is what I've been here
5480700	5485940	She's I'd say I mean say oh you were you were you were saying the other week I
5486660	5491020	Want to play magic with your wife yeah, and then the next weekend
5491900	5495300	Kate is like going I'm going to play magic with with Spencer
5496220	5499580	And I was like well he won. I'm not
5500700	5504540	Magic move it's I don't play against a lot of good players
5504540	5510540	I mean like why is Kate the best I don't know it's weird usually when you teach someone to play magic
5510540	5512900	They follow a very slow progression
5512900	5516340	It's like and it's it's very frustrating to play with new magic players
5516340	5519420	Right because they don't seem to catch on very quick
5519420	5524660	But she might like Zach is the other guy who's good and then Ryan we play with he's probably Ryan's probably the best
5524660	5529180	But I think she might be better than Zach which is saying something because presumably Zach taught her to play
5529180	5532580	It's hard to surpass a teacher that
5534380	5540640	Which Kate right yeah, but here's the thing I think Kate has this
5541340	5544620	almost magical ability to
5545500	5546740	find
5546740	5554480	Stuff and I think it's because there's cards and it's like supernatural like she's better at finding like keys and things
5554660	5556660	Well, yeah
5558540	5559980	I'll go
5559980	5562300	This happens like five times a day
5562940	5567300	Fuck I'll let the dog out or I'm gonna be late for my meeting. I can't find my keys
5567900	5574260	If I make it do you want me to help you find your keys? No, I can find my own keys Kate. I
5575100	5577100	Can find my own keys?
5578820	5582420	Where are my keys do you want me? Yeah, they're right here
5582940	5588380	She always she could find anything she's got excellent finding skills when I was married to McGathey
5588540	5594020	So she's the source of this or someone else's but she sold I didn't see shells
5594020	5596020	I didn't decide that this was a thing
5596100	5600980	Thanks, cuz this is like declarations of but I heard a thing that I didn't directly read about
5602060	5603740	women
5603740	5605740	being better scanners
5605940	5612340	Right visually that that but that could have come from the pages of hustler. I don't know
5612500	5617980	My mom said there's male pattern blindness and that's why guys can never find things and women can find them
5617980	5623500	It's something about like like the idea was I'm not pushing this forth and saying I believe it
5623500	5625860	I'm saying I found this in the bamboo
5626380	5628940	Forest of my mind because someone put it there
5628940	5632700	It was a thing that came up at some point the idea that women
5633420	5636260	Because I've experienced the same thing. Yeah, but with
5636780	5642620	More than one like I like I'm like where and then they get involved and then it's
5643900	5650300	Immediately very quickly and it's embarrassing because it's like on a shoe and you're like, but that's a shoe and the keys
5650580	5653460	Yeah, the idea was that this is so counter
5655020	5657020	That women can like take a
5657980	5662020	Robocop like snapshot in a second. They see everything at once
5662220	5666060	I bet that's gotta be because that just feeds into the idea that they're like
5667660	5671860	Kate's the only woman that I've ever met that could do it to this degree
5671860	5677440	And and I think she's also it doesn't surprise me that she's good at magic cards
5678820	5686140	So and also she plays to win, right? She plays to win
5686860	5688860	well, I don't like games because
5689580	5691580	It's not I don't like competition
5692100	5697940	It's fun. I don't like I don't play to win. I don't like losing. I see I don't mind losing
5697940	5702900	I don't have it in me to go. I have to win right because I go. Yeah
5703540	5710420	If I lose fuck it, it's it's how fun is this anyway, but Kate is more
5711100	5715180	No, I'm winning. Well, I like trying to I like trying to win
5715180	5719660	but I don't but I feel bad when if I'm playing a game like
5721300	5723780	Like like where I feel like the other I can't win
5724300	5726300	Because I have actually feel bad for the other person
5726620	5733740	I'm like like Cody taught me connect for and I was like you can't win. I can't wait connect for it's and but but but
5734140	5737180	But I also I've won a couple times
5737180	5742880	That's a bad example like because it keeps me just going like I'm gonna fucking win. That's what I like
5742880	5746760	I think it's funny and fun to be like I want to win
5746760	5748000	This is the most important thing in the world
5748000	5753920	But only if it means that you might kind of maybe if you believe you have to believe in it because there's some
5754080	5759240	Most games. I'm so bad at that. I can't really it's like who are we kidding? I'm not gonna win, right?
5759240	5764280	I feel like you'd be a scrabble master. No, that's what a lot of people think. That's why you're
5765040	5766600	Pictionary. Yeah
5766600	5767920	Yeah
5767920	5773440	Finally you're amazing a picture. No, no, I fucking hate Pictionary
5773840	5775840	And I fucking hate
5775880	5782480	Pictionary don't ask me to play Pictionary because whenever somebody goes let's play Pictionary people go well
5782480	5788000	Rob's on our team and I was like motherfucker. I didn't even say I was gonna play you didn't even ask
5788560	5795240	You're not even looking at me Rob's on my team Rob's on my team. Go fuck yourself. I'm going home
5796200	5798200	Fuck off
5801760	5807040	But this is like a 20 year old the last time I talked about something you used to say all the time you were like
5807040	5812080	How long ago was that? Excuse me? Is that impression? Yeah, I was good. I knew what you mean
5812880	5816200	So it yeah, I mean like but you're not thinking about it. You don't really
5816760	5821800	You're you're 83 years old now. Do you still hate Pictionary? Yes. Oh, okay
5821800	5826800	Yeah, it's a Pictionary because because it's because the time limit
5828320	5831820	You know and and people are shouting at you and stuff
5831820	5837840	I want to if I'm gonna draw something I want it to be good and on my terms and I don't want somebody to go
5838360	5841420	And time's up. What is that?
5842680	5849000	Well, there's a cross hatching because there's a shadows here and like that, but I don't even know couldn't you make it simpler
5849160	5855200	I mean, it's it's can you dumb it down because it's it doesn't have to be good
5855200	5859760	I just need to know what it is. Why did you take so much time on the stem?
5860960	5865640	Just drop just trying to happen. I just don't know it's just everybody gets all
5866480	5872080	Critical of you when I could out fucking draw anybody in this room
5872520	5878360	Can't those both be true because no I think no one would agree that that's like an amazing apple you're drawing
5878360	5881200	But at the same time in the terms of the constraints of the game
5881200	5884920	It probably is conducive to draw like a simpler Apple, right? Yes
5884920	5889200	That's why I hate Pictionary right because it doesn't value what you value about drawing, right?
5889200	5893920	Right. Okay, and so there should be a game that I could play that you don't like
5896920	5898920	All right, well
5898960	5903920	Well, we do I want to play that I want I want to play I'm gonna have to go out of airplane mode to do this
5903920	5907720	But I really want to play the are you gonna turn into an airplane? No
5907720	5912600	No, I wanted to play the dick and Morty trailer. Oh boy. I don't but you know what?
5912600	5916400	I should have I didn't I heard that his name is Rick in the wait a minute
5916400	5920720	No, it's just so is it two dudes and no it's like an alien chick
5920720	5927120	I don't that's already like well, there's no indicate. Well, how would you do a Rick and what two gay dudes?
5927360	5929360	Yeah, dick and Morty
5929440	5936040	There's a dick inside Morty with his hands not dick in but Morty's pretty defined by okay
5936920	5941880	Illegality what age wise Morty is pretty defined. It'd be like if you did a Simpsons porn
5941880	5946960	Are you gonna have Marg? Bart and Lisa in it? Oh, yeah. Well, I've seen that
5947400	5952840	You've seen a porn with Bart and Lisa in it. Oh, yeah, and it's depicting Bart and Lisa like fire aged up
5952840	5956200	Usually characters get aged up. Okay. I didn't know about that
5958320	5965480	Yeah, right well, no, no you're talking about like rule 34 like no I'm talking about Pornhub
5966880	5973560	Oh cartoon, yeah, what though we're talking about the Simpsons, would you think I meant pantomime people painting mom?
5973960	5978640	Saying oh boy, don't wanna fuck Bart. Oh, don't have a anal cow
5979920	5982640	Like like that took about a live-action porno
5982640	5986240	It's like that's not if you are if you do want a Bart Simpson porn
5986240	5990120	You don't want to see people painted in yellow body paint like that. That's the
5990360	5998200	Anyone want to see this well, that's what I'm saying. It's like they're not a cool Rick. It's not it's not like cartoon Rick fucking cartoon Morty
5998200	6001400	It's like weird porn actors painted up green and such
6002200	6003440	green
6003440	6005400	Yeah, I hate
6005400	6010040	You gotta get really hit it. No, it's not a new phone. It's a new society. Oh, okay
6010040	6013360	So I'm just gonna bring this up is that cuz I can't find this anywhere
6013520	6017520	If you're watching porn on an iPad, there's these new redirect ads
6017720	6022160	They always are trying to take your browser all over the place. You can't watch porn anymore
6022160	6027720	I can't find anything about online is no one else like putting up against this or is no one talking about it
6027720	6032000	This is only happening to me. No, I don't I have a pornhub premium
6032000	6038240	Oh, yeah, so if you're only on pornhub is like one of it never does it but but you primarily use your iPad for porn
6038240	6042800	Well, yeah, I think most people primarily that when I worked at Apple that was like gross
6043040	6045040	It's not you don't want to talk about it, but
6045680	6048120	You're looking at no no at Apple
6048120	6054840	It turns out that everyone uses their iPad for like that's one of the main reasons people buy iPads for porn viewing
6054840	6060040	Yeah, the watch porn. That's a weird choice cuz yeah, not actually that much of a but it doesn't stand up on it
6060040	6065280	So no, it sure doesn't I I will say like like if you're if you're just looking at photos
6065600	6069240	If you the ten point five inch iPad Pro
6069920	6071920	You could rub the corner on your nipple
6072520	6078920	Much details. Yeah. Okay. Sorry too much details, but I I just wanted to find this video
6078920	6084800	I just wanted to play the audio of the I'm sure somebody's already posted it. I know of course they have it's the internet
6084800	6088880	I'm just saying like I wanted to I want okay. I wanted you to hear it's okay
6088880	6094840	Maybe Steve can search I keep accidently subscribing to things. I don't know what it's fine. Everyone dropped their phones
6094840	6100840	Not that bad. Yeah, I draw I mean yeah, so to Rob. Oh, I just he's so upset
6100840	6107360	Don't drop star of amping vamp for what do you want me to vamp about like do some talking or maybe rapping trying to talk?
6107360	6111320	I don't want to rap. No, come on. I'm playing this I'm gonna find it. No you will but we're
6113880	6119520	You see Camille on it, I mean really rock that suit. I am I don't like him in a suit
6120360	6122360	Handsome
6123000	6129160	Powerful like what he looks like he could be the president thinking leaving. I think that's great. No, it's great, but it's like man
6129160	6133820	You know he's like a muscle shirt. Were you up? I'm sorry. We're sorry. We're having to go
6134320	6139040	I thought it was funny. I was trying to be funny cuz I thought it is while you guys were talking that I was like
6139880	6145520	I just thought I just whatever it's playing into a speaker play it through the court you have whatever it goes fast. He has it
6146400	6149120	Not whatever is the right way to do it, but whatever happens
6149840	6151840	Okay, so
6151840	6159500	Trailer for the Rick and a Rick and Morty porn movie and it's not animated is people painted blue hair
6159500	6161760	We can't hear or I can't hear it at least. Oh
6163080	6165080	There you go
6166160	6168160	Yeah, okay
6168880	6170880	So echoey oh
6173880	6176880	Man they're taking shots things look like meth rocks
6180200	6182200	Oh
6183680	6185680	That's unity comes through a portal
6186480	6189640	Don't mean spray me with your testicle means session one sauce
6191440	6193440	I'm pickle tape
6198920	6201200	Yeah, that take my bird
6203640	6205640	Looks like she's completely filled up
6209520	6211520	Maybe you should take a look in the mirror
6221320	6224920	So at one point in there that it cuts it goes like yeah Beth he's talking about his daughter
6231160	6233160	I didn't even need to see the visual
6233560	6238080	There's no wrong answer I don't know where I'm torn this is one of those things
6238080	6241960	It's like oh five weeks from now five months from now five years from now
6241960	6243280	You gotta go fine
6243280	6249160	I made it will I will I look back on these days when I considered it an innocent honor to express
6249160	6253200	It's like this is what in my this is what I have been working
6253800	6261020	about in your whole life a community porno a Rick and Morty porno because yeah, it's a it is a milestone there is no
6261460	6267780	Porno version of the pamphlet you're handing out door-to-door. There's no porno version of the dishes you wash
6267780	6269300	There's no porno versions
6269300	6274000	There is porno versions of people if you if you if you permeate if you
6274340	6278660	Infiltrate the collective unconscious to a certain degree and no it's not that much
6278660	6284740	It's not a sign of bravery or nobility or goodness. It's simply a really clear milestone that like
6285340	6288620	Like the idea of a porno version of a thing that you created
6288620	6293860	Well, it's something the reason that it's like it's like what we would always talk about with just like what?
6294460	6300740	You know creating icons and things like that is like if somebody could make a Halloween costume of your character
6300740	6305500	You know it's very simple. You know you've got like these very simple shapes
6306220	6313060	Blue hair spiky drool lab coat your Rick okay, and Morty short yellow hair
6313660	6314700	Oh jeez
6314700	6320900	Yeah, now make them fuck you got a porno right the easier it is the more likely it's gonna happen of course
6320900	6323380	It needs to be popular too. There's also kind of flattery
6323380	6327100	It's like if you're if you're a kid in high so it just it just means you decided like you want
6327100	6330800	I want to be the kid that have puts on like I'm gonna get these big thick rimmed
6331700	6337980	eyeglasses right and you're at the Stein optical and if that exists and you get them and you're like and then you're wearing them
6337980	6341740	you're like man a lot of people are giving me shit cuz now I'm
6342260	6344940	I'm the person that has like manhole covers on their face
6344940	6346180	I got these big giant glasses
6346180	6351360	but then the day that like you fantasize about if you're fantasizing about popularity or
6351740	6353740	cultural like efficacy is like
6353820	6360640	That that you know you're it's like so-and-so for class president and the and and the drawing of your logo
6360980	6365300	Silhouette thing is like there's this big giant pair of glasses. It's like I did it
6365420	6368280	There's some kind of like local boy makes good
6368960	6373480	Like I'm in your I'm in your sex now. Yeah, like I I
6374240	6375520	did like I
6375520	6376660	was watching mr
6376660	6382480	Rogers on your TV and then I went out to Los Angeles and I made a thing and I hit the bell and I got
6382480	6385600	The cookie and it came all the way back around that. It's like
6387400	6392120	You're masturbating to it now. Yeah, or it's like yeah, it's being it's
6392600	6397900	Yeah, I guess it's just a it's just a like it's cool. It's deeply deeply engran
6400400	6404020	But I definitely will like like a couple years from now I
6404760	6409480	Expect to learn that there's some reason that I'm not looking at why that's like somehow like
6410120	6413520	As I'm recording that going like I'm so stoked about this. This is so great
6413520	6418240	How could this be wrong for anybody? Isn't this great? If you don't like it don't watch it. Wow, it's amazing
6418840	6423160	And I'll be looking at myself saying that and I go, oh you dummy you didn't know but that's good
6423360	6429360	That's good that you're not like oh years from now. I'm gonna be thinking the exact same thing
6429360	6433880	I'm thinking now that I mean like that's what I'm saying like hopefully you're changing
6433880	6441320	But there's a theme to this episode aside from you said it's it's forgive. Yeah, forgive the ignorant
6441320	6445560	So they yeah and and and and and be and admit your ignorance
6445560	6450920	yeah, don't get into an argument to win get into a discussion to
6451440	6457960	Understand like when you're in these Twitter arguments don't try to bury the other person
6457960	6462560	And and if you if the person starts making you like realize
6462560	6468920	Oh, yeah, maybe what I was thinking was wrong beat the bigger person and say yeah, I guess you're right
6469200	6473720	Well, I don't know about you, but every time the other person says that I'm always like I'm always like
6473800	6480280	Alright got it like with few exceptions. Listen, personally revved me up so much that I'm like, well next time don't fuck around
6481160	6484560	But mostly when some as soon as somebody goes like, you know what?
6484560	6489080	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Like I don't you know, it kind of like drains the whole thing
6489680	6495320	But anyway, but I mean, I think that's I think that's a natural thing because when you get into these arguments
6495320	6501680	You want to bury the other person is being right and it doesn't make sense because we're dumb people and not knowing shit is
6502080	6509040	means that we're about to learn something and we think that that means we're about to have something taken from us and I'm speaking for myself and
6509040	6509920	saying
6509920	6515380	Yeah, that that's you if you're wrong, you're dumb and no one wants to be called dumb, but but
6516000	6517600	What if you were smart now?
6517600	6521520	We just learned that you can be dumb and you could become in charge of all the nuclear weapons
6521520	6528680	Right, like so no one's saying being dumb is bad. You could not know shit and like run the world. In fact, you do
6529600	6531440	so now
6531440	6537560	Everybody let's be dumb, which means you don't already know what the fuck is going on. So now you can be like, sorry
6537560	6542560	I don't understand. I I sorry about that. I don't get it. I'm I don't know anything
6544240	6549120	You said Steinhoffels before do you guys know I said lens crafters, but no you said
6550480	6554920	Well, you did not say that you said you said Stein. I'm saying I'm gonna admit you're wrong
6555720	6559400	You okay. You never said Steinhoffels tonight. I
6560040	6562840	Don't think I did. I think I said lens crafters. It's
6563960	6570200	It's on the or maybe I said, okay, we'll find out but it anyway, that's not my point tweet it Rob
6570200	6575820	My point is that's what I was gonna ask. Is that a Milwaukee thing? I said lens crafters
6577000	6584320	Steinhoffel sign apples and lens crafters were the two places you could buy glasses in Robin and my eyes hometown
6584960	6586160	Yeah
6586160	6591640	Steinhoffels, I thought I said one he thinks I said the other I guess, you know, what else?
6592200	6595440	Was in our hometown and this is like on my crew
6601240	6607360	Ever and when I'm dead when I die at my funeral, even though I'm gonna be cremated
6608080	6613680	If you're gonna put me if you're gonna, you know, like Walter me and throw my ashes
6614120	6617120	You know unto the I want you to play this song
6618240	6621200	While I'm well, well, well, well, whatever you do
6621200	6647520	It's a good song it's a world of cameras a world of film it's a world where you can be whatever you feel
6647760	6654000	I can't find the extended version online. So I use your gremlins to go out there and find it cuz I
6654520	6657040	Would kill for the full
6658120	6660120	Microvelo
6660160	6665360	I was undercutting that I I was I thought I was making my own joke. I didn't know you were gonna load that up on your phone
6666120	6671840	Well, you teed me up because you sang the song and you're it's your show. I didn't know for those listening
6671840	6675000	I didn't know he was gonna pull that song out. I'm just I'm just saying
6675640	6681200	When I'm dead at the funeral, which you know if you can make it
6683000	6685000	Make sure that that song
6685480	6692000	Plays, you know just to send them home. That's what I want. I'm gonna I'm okay
6692280	6694360	well, I hope Kate's keeping track cuz
6695160	6700640	Is it we're recording it too by the way that in your living will it's not in my living will
6700640	6706200	I mean my that my ashes are gonna be planted under a tree. Do you have the tree picked out?
6707720	6712800	No, are you gonna do one of those life's pod things I'm thinking about doing that
6712800	6717480	I'm thinking about because I think that would be better than because I saw Neil Neil degrassi
6717480	6724240	He's like said I'm not gonna get cremated because you're just you're taking all your energy and you're dispelling it into the solar system
6724240	6729720	And they don't need that what we want to do is bury yourselves into the ground man
6729720	6733520	You know and give it to get energy back be a part of the world
6733840	6739960	Yeah, but and this is so ill-timed, but I this is literally coming in over the facts. I guess he he hits women
6740960	6746480	I'm kidding. Okay. All right. All right. Sorry. I thought it was true. All right. Yeah, it's a tough time. You see
6746680	6751800	That's why I guess that was my quote-unquote joke. I was like, I must have had a line. How would you know?
6753800	6755800	I don't think that's true
6755800	6759640	I don't know. It's not true. It's not true. It was a joke. I don't know why you
6762480	6766440	We don't know if it's not just not it's it's like milkshake duck
6766440	6772120	I don't know. He's trying to make a joke milkshake duck. Yeah, it turns out he's racist. Who's milkshake duck?
6772120	6776320	All right, we don't have milk. I don't know we didn't do
6777520	6779360	For the best
6779360	6782680	What did we learn? Yeah, you don't want to talk to my wife
6783400	6787360	Why why would you like what do you mean? What I don't know
6787360	6792800	I'd said hey, can I bring Kate along and you said absolutely and an exclamation point which is rare
6792800	6797720	Oh, I didn't from you. I said because it's fine. I mean, I didn't know you were taught
6798280	6803180	It's fine. It's not on microphone. I don't know we were talking about women's point of view
6805560	6806560	Okay
6806560	6811040	But it would have been great to have I didn't perceive that as a it's fine. No, we were having that misunderstanding
6811040	6818600	I literally thought you meant because I was like popping in here to do this thing and then you thought you literally meant
6818720	6820320	Can you bring?
6820320	6825080	Your wife with you as opposed to not being allowed to bring her I you
6825320	6829600	Like to come record the thing not can I bring her on the podcast?
6830480	6834080	Because then when someone had asked should leave me be sitting in this chair the entire time
6834080	6834880	I would have said no
6834880	6839840	Let's put Kate in that chair because I made an agreement you'd swap people out and have people I don't know
6840320	6842840	I I don't I'm not telling you how to run your show. I'm
6844680	6848880	I'm I'm giving light to the entire misunderstanding
6850880	6858360	I didn't I figured I I was like we're either gonna have a woman on here that we're gonna all like a sale with like
6858480	6862200	Points of view and questions or it's gonna be like dudes like talking
6862880	6863840	about
6863840	6867280	Like our stake in it and to each other about it
6867360	6874400	Which and and that I and to that end I had texted like for instance Emily Gordon on a Hail Mary because I thought she'd
6874400	6881280	Be like whatever and she was like, yeah, I'm I'm out of town. It's like and plus where is she New York, New York
6881280	6882760	She why?
6882760	6887760	Camille's on it hosted SNL right? When what day was that Saturday night?
6888680	6894480	Why no, sorry if anybody I'm sure Kate wasn't like all gussied up and ready to go
6894480	6900000	But I also feel bad if anybody thought I didn't I didn't mean to create that misunderstanding. No, no, it's fine
6900000	6904360	I mean, it's your show. I mean, I mean like, you know, maybe apologize to Kate
6905360	6907360	Okay. All right
6907760	6911520	All right. Okay. Good. Apologize. Can I Spencer can I practice ass?
6912840	6914840	Magic cards. Yeah
6919480	6921480	We drafted
6922480	6927200	Sorry, Kate and an apology is an acknowledgement. This is this is what you said when you
6928840	6930840	Married us, too
6930880	6932880	Sorry, Kate
6933320	6940480	I'm sorry. I have to do this team. I know I was I didn't I didn't think it through that what Rob was saying when he said
6940920	6946120	Can can't come was that it makes sense to me now. That's like, yeah, of course, you're gonna be spending two hours apart from Rob
6946120	6948120	I was in
6948480	6952480	Robbing Rob from their evening and I'm thinking like oh, yeah
6953120	6958200	He's asking she would come and watch through a piece of glass. She would love to watch me
6961480	6963480	Be an idiot
6968720	6971180	That truly is how I how I interpreted it
6972180	6977840	She can that's what my girlfriend has to do like is watch me through a piece of glass
6979460	6982200	Suck his own balls for an hour or two hours
6982940	6984540	anyways

7030940	7032500	asking you out and
7032500	7037180	Breaking up like like in every step of the way like I've always been like I don't know
7037180	7042220	I'm just doing a lot of reviewing and I think that I've I think I've been a bad bad
7042740	7045940	person because I think that I have thought of women differently I
7047900	7052020	Think I think the same thing about me. I think it's it it's
7052540	7057300	Good to acknowledge and move forward because every little piece of us
7057300	7061020	We're all pallbearers of the same coffin and then it's just because there's like one dude. That's like
7061020	7061660	Oh
