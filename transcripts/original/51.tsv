0	22280	Hello, one and all, welcome once again to Meltdown, the Nerdist Theater.
22280	24280	Harman Town is once again in session.
24280	25280	Good to see you all.
25280	29280	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
29280	49160	All right, first order of business, scheduling conflict, okay?
49160	54520	My animation studio, Starburns Industries, has a softball league that will be starting
54520	62240	in May, and I'm a great lover of organized sports, and I'm 40, and I'm in peak condition,
62240	63240	so I...
63240	65360	You're a born third baseman, I can tell by looking at you.
65360	70920	I immediately signed up for the softball league, and they're going to be playing, starting
70920	77040	in May, Monday nights, this is a Monday night, for those of you in podcast land, we record
77040	84440	on Monday nights, 6.45 to 7.30, shows here record at 8 o'clock.
84440	85720	I just need to...
85720	91600	So Jeff, I'm asking you, before I ask them, I just burped, I hope nobody heard that.
91600	93680	They heard you tell about it.
93680	95280	Nine o'clock?
95280	96280	Could we do nine o'clock?
96280	97280	When does the game get out?
97280	98280	It's a Monday night.
98280	99280	When does the game get out?
99280	100280	Well, 7.30.
100280	103000	Yeah, nine o'clock's fine.
103000	105080	I don't know, so I ask these people, I'm free.
105080	108720	Well, I mean, I think they'd say, shit, you guys start at eight, and then you don't get
108720	112680	out here until 8.15, and then I don't get home until midnight.
112680	114960	Our shows aren't getting any shorter, either.
114960	121560	No, I mean, I'll be just starting to rap at midnight, and I won't even get around to
121560	124480	the good stuff until 1 a.m.
124480	127960	Let's do it by applause, would nine o'clock be a bummer, for to be honest, that would
127960	130600	be a drag for anybody beside Adam Goldberg?
130600	133360	A couple people?
133360	134360	Don't be shy.
134360	135840	You're applauding for it being a bummer, right?
135840	139600	Yeah, you're saying that's getting on the late side, because you live in, you know,
139600	141120	Canoga Park or whatever.
141120	142120	Fuck you guys.
142120	143120	Canogites.
143120	144120	Canoga heads.
144120	150280	I don't know, man, I mean, I don't have a life.
150280	152080	Monday night means nothing to me.
152080	153080	It just means...
153080	155880	Can we do another night?
155880	157360	Let's find out and ask them.
157360	158360	Let's do Saturday nights.
158360	159360	7 p.m.
159360	160360	Perfect.
160360	162000	We'll just ask them real quick.
162000	163000	Who's here?
163000	164000	Robin Williams?
164000	165000	Fuck him.
165000	166000	Doesn't matter.
166000	167000	Dana Gold?
167000	168000	Got it.
168000	169000	Get out.
170000	174760	Okay, so, I, softball, okay, there's that, we'll talk.
174760	175760	What position are you going to play, Dan?
175760	178760	Because I really don't picture you out there tossing the old softball away.
178760	182840	Well, I kind of want to just commit to the fucking, like, nightmare of being in sixth
182840	187240	grade again and just go center field straight up, just like, and just stand there and get
187240	192800	lulled into a false sense of security until that crucial ball comes right at me and just
192800	193800	have it be like...
193800	198440	You can be like Lupus in the final scene of Bad News Bears and catch the ball and everybody
198440	199440	will hug you.
199440	203400	Yeah, I definitely will always be like Lupus in whatever sport I'm playing.
203400	206880	I will have the Lupus effect on any team that I'm on.
206880	207880	And you mean the disease?
207880	208880	Yes.
208880	217280	Yes, Jeff, I'm referring to the fatal illness.
217280	218280	So that's it.
218280	219960	I mean, how was your Easter, buddy?
219960	220960	It was great.
220960	221960	It was at your house.
221960	222960	I was there.
222960	223960	Yeah, yeah.
223960	226920	Dan, I've never seen Game of Thrones at Dan's place.
226920	229040	Dan gets up and does a little dance.
229040	230480	And when I say a little dance, it's not little.
230480	231480	It's enormous.
231480	233560	And I'm not joking.
233560	234600	That was pretty cool.
234600	235600	Oh, yeah?
235600	238640	He got up and did this thing and he looked like...
238640	239640	I don't know.
239640	240640	You look like a little ballerina.
240640	241640	But kind of like...
241640	245000	Kind of in a Shaolin soccer, kind of like...
245000	249480	I can't sit upon a game.
249480	251440	Do, do, do, do, do.
251440	252440	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
252440	253440	Game of Game of Thrones.
253440	258080	I can't even play a throne.
258080	262080	Game of Game of Thrones.
262080	267040	But I can sit upon this game of...
267040	268340	Game of Thrones.
268340	269340	Game of Thrones.
269340	270380	Game of Thrones.
270380	271460	Game of Thrones.
271460	272480	Game of Thrones.
272480	274020	Game of Thrones.
274020	275280	David Milch.
275280	276280	Yeah.
276280	279600	But you didn't do the dance.
279600	280600	He just stood there.
280600	281600	He got up and it was really...
281600	283400	You know it's a podcast, Jeff.
284400	286400	Fuck these people.
286400	289400	This is a laugh patch.
289400	290400	That's what this is.
290400	293400	We take the hoe and we just aggregate.
293400	296400	Just capture their imitation of humanity.
296400	301400	We're just making a jar of preserves out of their little fruit heads.
301400	303400	I was like, who cares?
303400	305400	I could point a gun at him and make him laugh.
305400	307400	You wouldn't be able to tell at home.
307400	309400	This is for the people in Poughkeepsie, Jeff.
309400	311400	That's how we make the bucks.
311400	315400	We want snickers to these fuckers in the Midwest.
315400	316400	Ooh!
316400	318400	A type of homotone.
318400	319400	Ooh!
319400	320400	Ooh!
320400	321400	A must buy.
321400	322400	I'm kidding, of course.
322400	325400	There's no money changing hands in any of us.
325400	328400	And yet you've just taken a giant shit in everybody's heads here.
328400	330400	Who paid $10 to get it?
330400	332400	That's the joke.
332400	333400	That was the joke.
333400	337400	It was inappropriate of me to do it.
337400	340400	How many people thought that was a bummer?
341400	342400	Why did you say that?
342400	343400	You really had them terrified.
343400	344400	Yeah, no, they don't care.
344400	345400	They're like, ooh!
345400	347400	And I just, I record them and then they go,
347400	348400	harm it now.
348400	349400	Ooh!
349400	351400	I mean, Jeff, there's nothing, there's nothing,
351400	352400	there's nothing we owe them.
352400	354400	They would be happy with anything.
354400	355400	Here, watch this.
355400	356400	Bobcat Goldpoint's here, everybody.
356400	357400	Let's bring them out.
357400	358400	They don't care.
364400	366400	Who gives a shit?
371400	372400	I don't know.
372400	373400	Fuck you.
373400	374400	Yeah, get out of here.
374400	375400	They don't care.
375400	376400	Nothing would affect them, Jeff.
376400	378400	Nothing would affect them.
378400	379400	Let's do another one.
379400	380400	Let's do another one.
380400	381400	Wait, for the people.
381400	382400	Ladies and gentlemen, Robin Williams.
385400	386400	Fuck you.
386400	387400	Yeah, yeah.
387400	388400	Fuck you guys.
391400	392400	Yeah, yeah.
392400	393400	You don't deserve it.
395400	397400	Kobe Bryant, Kobe Bryant, get out of here.
400400	408400	People listening to this podcast aren't going to have any idea what's going on.
408400	411400	I think they can tell the difference between the real,
411400	412400	yeah, the real reaction.
412400	413400	Yeah.
413400	415400	Let's do a fake one.
415400	417400	Barack Obama's here.
417400	418400	Barack Obama!
421400	422400	All right.
423400	426400	Let's get Bobcat Goldpoint and Robin Williams back out here.
431400	432400	Wow.
433400	434400	How are you?
439400	440400	We don't want to waste...
440400	443400	I think Laker's going to play well this year.
444400	446400	I'm trying to do Kobe Bryant, but not be racist.
447400	449400	Yeah, good luck with that, motherfucker.
450400	452400	I'm saying, I'm saying to Lakers.
454400	456400	I know you guys are just here to get comic books,
456400	458400	so I don't want to waste your time.
458400	460400	I know you guys are just here to get comic books,
460400	462400	so I don't want to take up too much of your time.
462400	463400	Damn you, you bastards.
463400	464400	Is that true?
464400	466400	You guys just popped in to get some books?
466400	467400	Yeah, just to get some books.
467400	468400	That's all.
469400	471400	I had no idea there was a comedy show going on here.
471400	473400	No, I just go, what's going on in the back?
473400	476400	He can stop any time he wants.
476400	478400	He's still having fun with his books.
479400	481400	That's what I call him, my books.
482400	485400	And my videos are just, that's my porn.
485400	487400	But Robin, you really are a comic book aficionado, right?
487400	489400	You were here the last time Bob was here,
489400	490400	you were just like cruising around.
490400	491400	Looking in the back there.
491400	494400	Hi, do you have any old issues of transmetropolitan?
495400	497400	What do you, what you divulge?
497400	499400	What comic books you still collect, read?
499400	502400	Oh, I started off collecting Mobius, and...
503400	505400	For Mobius, I don't know.
505400	507400	Maitre le l'homme, bloke, incolnoir.
508400	511400	It's great when you're reading them in French and only getting half of it.
512400	514400	I started, that was years ago, buying heavy metal
514400	520400	and then starting off with that and then working to transmetropolitan, big time, planetoid.
520400	522400	And now, multiple warheads, have you?
523400	525400	No, I hate comic books.
527400	528400	After all, that's what I was going...
528400	530400	Okay, this really doesn't work.
530400	531400	A little help here?
532400	533400	Exactly.
533400	537400	I used to write comic books in the 90s during the big black and white comic book explosion
537400	541400	and we found out you can just barely make enough money to keep printing them.
542400	543400	Oh, big time.
543400	545400	It was rough, it was a labor of love.
545400	547400	So when they went color, you got out?
549400	550400	When they went back to color, yeah.
550400	552400	When they were like, these black and white things are doing so good,
552400	554400	all the good black and white ones are now, let's do color.
554400	557400	And we were like, we're still black and white, and they were like, we smell a rat.
558400	561400	So, you were asking what you guys did for Easter.
561400	563400	Robin, what did you do for Easter?
563400	566400	I went to Bob's house, and Bob was on the lot, and it was kind of fun.
566400	567400	What is that?
568400	569400	It's like morphine?
570400	573400	Yeah, like morphine.
573400	575400	Was this just recreational, or did you have a thing?
575400	576400	No.
576400	577400	Without the needles and the spoons.
577400	578400	Exactly.
578400	583400	I have a back injury, but I got really...
584400	587400	Yeah, and I had, and after my open heart surgery, that's why...
588400	590400	Chevy Chase's back injury, right?
591400	593400	That's why I need a propofold to sleep.
594400	598400	As the day went on, it was clear that I was stoned out of my mind.
599400	603400	And I'm just sitting there wearing hats. I kept putting on hats.
603400	605400	And they didn't fit, which was fucked up, too.
605400	607400	More than one at a time?
607400	609400	No, just like suddenly I was in an army hat,
609400	613400	and I'm walking around the house with one of my cats' toys.
614400	617400	Even the cats looked at you like, he's fucked up.
619400	623400	Like, listen, Detective Carly Whiskey's saying, I don't need that from you.
624400	629400	Robin Williams, this is actually the second time I've been this close to you.
630400	632400	The other time I didn't know?
633400	635400	What are you doing? Nothing!
635400	637400	Hi, man.
637400	639400	You were in bed at a Ritz Carlton.
639400	642400	The first time was when you were this close to all of America, Patch Adams.
642400	644400	I was touched with that.
644400	646400	Oh, no. Oh, fuck.
646400	648400	So you were affected, too.
648400	652400	Yes, I too got a prescription of laughter.
653400	657400	They used that in that movie to depress hyperactive children.
657400	661400	I was this close to you because you were dropping Andy Dick up outside my apartment,
661400	664400	like so much human garbage, in like a minivan.
664400	668400	That's what he told me. He said, hey, this is my coke dealer. Do you want to come in?
669400	672400	I was like going, no, I'm okay. I've got six years. I'm good.
673400	676400	I'm honored that he said I was his dealer. I was just waiting for him.
676400	678400	Was that when he was going to your house?
678400	679400	Yeah, he was coming to my place.
679400	682400	But the reason he was allowed to is because he said you were coming.
682400	685400	So I was like, well, this is a thing.
685400	690400	Andy Dick says, come inside a room with him. I'm going, no, no, I'm okay.
691400	693400	I'm trying to get him into a meeting.
693400	695400	Andy, you want to go to a meeting?
695400	697400	No, no, this is this. Let's come inside here.
697400	698400	No, I'm okay. I'm fine.
698400	701400	Who lives up there? It's Mark. Just come upstairs. No, I'm good.
701400	705400	So you said, where's Robin Williams? And he goes, there he is.
705400	706400	He's speeding up.
706400	707400	There he goes.
708400	710400	Andy, get out of my house.
710400	716400	Because you're above a certain strata of celebrity where no matter what would happen,
716400	723400	and this must be a curse for people above this strata because I live in a planet full of people that feel this way.
724400	729400	Like you are not, no matter what happens, if you come into my place, there's a story.
729400	731400	That's not fair to a human being.
731400	733400	He was in the room.
733400	737400	If you came in and you were like, oh, the air conditioning is too high. Could you turn it down?
737400	741400	Then for the rest of my life in that apartment, I'd be like, hey, should I turn down the air conditioning?
741400	744400	Like fucking Robin Williams wanted, like when he was here.
744400	746400	What a dick.
746400	748400	Do you want me to move this coffee table?
748400	751400	You didn't want to sweat like Lindsay Lohan in the witness protection program.
751400	755400	Everything would be like, do you need an ashtray? Robin Williams touched it.
755400	761400	Like whatever, ranging from, it wouldn't matter. It would be weird that you're above that level.
761400	763400	Does that affect you?
763400	765400	I'm not above that level.
765400	766400	Not to you.
766400	768400	Oh, no, thank you.
768400	770400	That was like what someone once said.
770400	774400	I was once working with a director whose name she'll never use because he's so high.
774400	779400	He once said, wouldn't Roman's nose be in his point of view?
779400	782400	Terrence Malick?
782400	785400	At that point, even the guys went, oh, no, no.
785400	791400	And he used to brag about having all this head trauma that he'd had seven major head traumas before the age of 16.
791400	796400	But back to the, did he want you to supply the nose for the POV shot?
796400	798400	Were you supposed to sit on his camera?
798400	800400	Yeah, was he talking for the prop master?
800400	805400	It'd be like having your own balls in a porn shot. Why?
805400	808400	He was so fucking out there.
808400	812400	It would be good though to just have a POV shot with his nose out in front of him.
812400	815400	Or are we talking about Patch Adam because you had a clown nose on.
815400	816400	That would be easy.
816400	817400	Maybe that would be easy.
817400	820400	Oh, just a hint of red in the bottom of the frame.
820400	824400	Because there's a really weird Kubrickian segment in Patch Adams where it just goes...
824400	828400	Wake up, Timmy, wake up.
828400	831400	There's a child's face with a little bit of red in it.
831400	837400	It's for the criterion cut. There's like this nightmare sequence that's like, wake up, Timmy.
837400	840400	You have the greatest line about in the world when you had that time when you went on the show.
841400	844400	When Shakes the Clown came out, a clown...
844400	846400	Thank you.
846400	851400	And a clown debated me on the Today Show.
851400	853400	I didn't know this was going to happen.
853400	855400	Just the idea clown debate would be a great category.
855400	857400	Well, they stopped...
857400	859400	Was it about tax reform or what?
859400	862400	Yeah, it was. Oddly enough, they didn't bring up Shakes once.
862400	864400	No.
864400	867400	And they stopped me in the hallway and the producer goes,
867400	870400	a clown is going to debate you on the program.
870400	871400	And that was the first I heard of it.
871400	874400	And I go, yeah, I know. I'm familiar with your show.
879400	882400	I get my apologies to Katie.
882400	885400	So then the clown is in a bad mood.
885400	887400	Anyone tell me his real name?
887400	890400	I go, we're going on the show today. I'm Bob, Bobcat.
890400	893400	Wait, what's your name? And he's like bamboozle.
893400	895400	And I go, what's your real name?
896400	899400	I go, I'm going to rip you a new one when we get out there,
899400	902400	but it's not personal. It's just good TV.
902400	904400	So we get out there...
904400	906400	Did you tell him you also had a comic name?
906400	909400	Yeah, I asked him to call me shit stain ass whippy.
909400	911400	I said that was...
911400	913400	Because he said I'm in my clown attire.
913400	915400	Only called me by my clown name.
915400	918400	I go, I'm in my comedian attire. Call me shit stain ass whippy.
918400	922400	So we get out there and the clown now does...
922400	924400	It was funny because that was when I was doing my character.
924400	927400	But he switches into a character too.
927400	930400	He's like clowns do a lot of good for a lot of good clowns.
930400	933400	And Bobcat's film portrays him in a negative way.
933400	936400	And I go, nobody thinks you're funny.
936400	938400	The only reason you perform in hospitals,
938400	941400	because that's one place a kid can't get up and run away from you.
945400	947400	But you have taken clowns to the old man.
947400	949400	You played. What did you play recently?
949400	951400	Which clown?
951400	952400	Gathering the Juggalos.
952400	955400	Oh yeah, yeah, I did the Gathering of the Juggalos.
955400	957400	What do you mean you did the Gathering of the Juggalos?
957400	958400	I performed there.
958400	960400	Like an instant clown boxing concert?
960400	961400	Yeah, I did stand up.
961400	963400	He did stand up, which is pretty much...
963400	965400	So like opening for them?
965400	967400	They have a three day festival.
967400	968400	It's actually a week long.
968400	972400	The fact that there's a comedy tent at the Gathering of the Juggalos.
972400	975400	And there's also a vegetarian booth.
975400	977400	Well, I will say this.
977400	979400	Just put the soybeans up my ass.
979400	981400	Just do it!
981400	983400	And then at 9 o'clock, two mallets.
987400	989400	I was going there and I was like going...
989400	995400	I thought, what I'm going to do is I'm going to explain how magnets work.
998400	1000400	And that's how magnets work.
1000400	1001400	Throw the mic out.
1001400	1003400	You would have gotten a government grant for that.
1003400	1007400	But as I got to the venue,
1008400	1011400	there was no police and a lot of bath salts.
1015400	1016400	It was weird.
1016400	1017400	I figured this out.
1017400	1021400	They're really just a group of people that just don't want to be messed with.
1021400	1022400	You know what I mean?
1022400	1024400	They're probably pretty defensive.
1024400	1025400	I imagine...
1025400	1026400	That's what I'm saying.
1026400	1028400	But it's not like bikers going.
1028400	1031400	You know, I grew up around bikers.
1031400	1033400	It's really like an incest...
1033400	1035400	It's like bikers without bikes.
1036400	1040400	If I had $2,000, I'd be a biker.
1040400	1043400	Bikers without bikes is a good charity.
1044400	1045400	Please help.
1046400	1047400	This is Carl.
1047400	1048400	He's only got one wheel.
1048400	1049400	Please help.
1050400	1052400	He's got a pair of handlebars and a wheel.
1052400	1053400	Please help.
1053400	1055400	And a shitload of tattoos.
1055400	1056400	Call this number.
1056400	1058400	Flashing at the bottom of your screen.
1058400	1059400	Here's a Care Bear tattoo.
1059400	1060400	Please help.
1061400	1063400	My name is Low Life.
1063400	1065400	And I don't have a bike.
1066400	1069400	So that was a real guy that used to hang out at the house, Low Life.
1069400	1070400	Shout out.
1073400	1074400	Careful.
1074400	1076400	You'll make his name irrelevant.
1076400	1078400	You'll put him on top.
1078400	1085400	It really is like a group of incest survivors getting together and going...
1085400	1088400	Nobody's going to touch me in the stinker anymore if I don't want it.
1089400	1092400	I'm going to get really big and wear clown makeup.
1093400	1094400	Yeah.
1097400	1099400	Our lines are open.
1100400	1103400	Please call the number Flashing at the bottom of your screen, ladies and gentlemen.
1103400	1107400	I have to say, Kobe, you've been awfully quiet during all this.
1108400	1111400	I don't know where Bob's going with his riff, but he's a motherfucker.
1112400	1114400	Oh, I love him saying clown posse.
1116400	1119400	Kobe sounds like Don Rickles' impression of him.
1120400	1122400	Oh, Lord, help me move this motherfucker.
1123400	1124400	I'll say it.
1124400	1125400	All right.
1125400	1126400	You can't even tell now.
1127400	1128400	No, come on.
1128400	1129400	Don't see him at all.
1130400	1133400	You know these clowns got crazy names.
1134400	1136400	Isn't that true, Slappy?
1137400	1138400	I love it.
1139400	1144400	So, yeah, and it's a long story, but up Chuck the Clown who opened up for me,
1145400	1150400	a decent fella, and was trying to explain to me that it's not that bad.
1150400	1152400	And you know how they throw Fago Cola?
1152400	1155400	He's giving you the juggalo venue pep talk.
1156400	1157400	It's not that bad.
1157400	1158400	He took me around on a golf cart.
1159400	1160400	There's an SNL scout out there.
1163400	1168400	You know that he gave you the whole Chinese character for Crisis is the same as opportunity speech.
1169400	1172400	Yeah, well, look, you know, if you're having fun, they're having fun.
1173400	1174400	As long as the audience...
1175400	1178400	No, so he's driving me around and there's fires going on.
1178400	1180400	This is a show where Teal Tequila got...
1181400	1184400	They ran out of Fago Cola to hit her with, so they threw poo at her.
1185400	1187400	They knocked over an outhouse.
1189400	1190400	Not Teela.
1190400	1191400	Not Teela, yeah.
1191400	1193400	Teela didn't knock over the outhouse and went,
1194400	1196400	Who am I rooting for in that story?
1197400	1200400	It's like these stories about Leno going toe to toe with Bob Greenblatt.
1200400	1201400	I don't know what's...
1202400	1203400	Which side am I on?
1203400	1206400	I wonder if they knocked it over like you knock over a bank or...
1207400	1208400	Put the shit in the bank!
1209400	1210400	Just put the shit in the bank!
1211400	1212400	Don't mind all the clowns, just put the shit in the bank.
1212400	1214400	It's my friend who's only got one wheel.
1214400	1215400	Put the shit in the bank!
1216400	1217400	Hey, man.
1218400	1220400	Hey, there's a lot of shit in there, man.
1220400	1222400	It's Chijin Chog showed up.
1223400	1226400	I said buy some shit, not real shit, dumb fuck.
1227400	1229400	Teal Tequila did not knock over the outhouse.
1229400	1230400	She's really tiny.
1230400	1232400	She'd be like, a little help here?
1233400	1237400	So after they ran out of poo to throw at her, then where do you go?
1237400	1239400	Organs? Human organs? I don't know.
1239400	1240400	So I am...
1242400	1243400	So Upchug's leg on.
1243400	1245400	This is a decent group of people, you know?
1245400	1246400	I'm here every year.
1246400	1247400	You're missing this dude.
1247400	1250400	And then this clown, this huge guy just burst out through the crowd.
1250400	1252400	By the way, there's fires and fights going on.
1252400	1255400	But this guy is all sweaty and crazy looking, and he goes,
1255400	1257400	Fuck you, Upchug! Fuck you!
1257400	1260400	And he just pounds the shit out of Upchug.
1260400	1261400	Offstage or on stage?
1261400	1264400	No, he's on the golf cart, so he hits gas and we scoot out.
1264400	1265400	Oh, he's driving through us.
1265400	1266400	He's chasing us.
1266400	1269400	He's giving you a ride at a golf cart through a sea of broken humanity.
1269400	1271400	If you drive by ass-kicking.
1271400	1274400	This will be the YouTube footage you want to find.
1274400	1278400	So we gun the car, and then he goes,
1278400	1281400	You know, they know me. It's like family.
1281400	1282400	That's why.
1282400	1284400	He's trying to laugh that off.
1284400	1289400	And then a can of Faygo hits the golf cart, and it's all over us.
1289400	1294400	Faygo, apparently if it's diet, it doesn't stick or stain,
1294400	1296400	because Upchug goes, this diet, don't worry.
1296400	1297400	He's a connoisseur.
1297400	1300400	He's really splitting hairs.
1300400	1302400	He's this close to suicide.
1302400	1304400	He's going to hit with enough Faygo.
1304400	1307400	By the way, I'm not sponsored by Faygo in any way.
1307400	1308400	I know I'm mentioning it a lot.
1308400	1312400	Or Upchug the Clown, whose autobiography hits shelves never.
1312400	1314400	He's hanging from the rafters upstairs.
1314400	1316400	His title, it doesn't stain.
1316400	1319400	Upchug's got a podcast, it doesn't stain.
1319400	1321400	Upchug's untold story.
1321400	1326400	And it's also books on tape, told very slowly.
1326400	1329400	Only love stains.
1329400	1333400	Now, when he was...
1333400	1335400	Saw just memories.
1335400	1337400	So he...
1337400	1339400	At that moment even...
1339400	1345400	He hits the gas again after the Faygo cola, and we're driving.
1345400	1348400	And as he's trying to tell me that this show is...
1348400	1353400	It's not any more rowdy than a Dave Matthews concert.
1353400	1358400	At that point, a can of unopened Faygo comes whizzing in
1358400	1361400	and cracks him in the head like a baseball pitch.
1361400	1364400	And he just slumps over and he goes, I'm hurt.
1364400	1366400	I'm hurt really bad.
1366400	1367400	I'm hurt.
1367400	1368400	Bob, take the wheel.
1368400	1369400	I'm hurt.
1369400	1370400	He called me Bob.
1370400	1371400	Bob will take the wheel.
1371400	1373400	And he hits the gas.
1373400	1374400	Help me, buddy.
1374400	1375400	And I'm steering.
1375400	1376400	Be my wingman.
1376400	1377400	Help, take the wheel, Bobby.
1377400	1379400	And I got a book coming out.
1379400	1380400	Take the wheel.
1380400	1386400	And I'm steering, whizzing through the clowns like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
1386400	1389400	And he's not diving out of the way.
1389400	1391400	This should fucking have that at the gathering of the...
1391400	1394400	Time to go through the gathering of the clowns.
1394400	1397400	Makes Pirates of the Caribbean look like shit.
1397400	1400400	It was so...
1400400	1404400	Oh, and then his head swelled up and he...
1404400	1405400	Not figuratively.
1405400	1407400	No, it looked like...
1407400	1410400	The side of his head looked like a stink bug.
1410400	1414400	And he's asking me if I can tell if he's bleeding.
1414400	1417400	And I'm like, I don't know what's blood and what's you.
1417400	1420400	Because he had all the clown makeup and he's all up-steering.
1420400	1423400	Where does up-chuck begin?
1423400	1425400	If only he knew.
1425400	1426400	Yeah.
1426400	1427400	And then...
1427400	1430400	Do you want to know what he put on his head for the swelling?
1430400	1432400	Ice cold Faygo.
1433400	1436400	Brought to you by Ice-Ironic.
1436400	1437400	How fucking ironic.
1437400	1438400	He really did.
1438400	1440400	That is the definition of irony.
1440400	1444400	I've got a good photo of him holding this ice cold Faygo to his head
1444400	1447400	and his eyeballs are like little tiny pinpoints.
1447400	1448400	I have a question.
1448400	1449400	What's a juggalo?
1449400	1451400	And what the hell was this event?
1451400	1452400	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1452400	1453400	It's the gathering of the juggalos.
1453400	1455400	It's in St. Colm Posse's fans.
1455400	1456400	Ah, okay, I didn't know.
1456400	1458400	And they have this convention.
1459400	1463400	Or, you know, a ton of acts go on and there's, like I said, a lot of fights.
1463400	1466400	There's only been, I think, four deaths in ten years.
1466400	1467400	Only four.
1467400	1468400	It's cool.
1468400	1469400	Yeah.
1469400	1470400	And, um...
1470400	1471400	And Bob was on.
1471400	1472400	Like, I'll hear from them, but I don't...
1472400	1475400	I have to say, they were very receptive and a very nice crowd.
1475400	1476400	I went on at 1 a.m.
1476400	1477400	Oh, really?
1477400	1483400	And much of the following week I played Arkansas and had a way worse time.
1483400	1487400	So really, after all that, you can't drive a golf cart through them...
1487400	1488400	Without getting hit with...
1488400	1490400	With a can of faggo.
1490400	1492400	Am I pronouncing that right?
1492400	1493400	Oh, no.
1493400	1494400	No.
1494400	1495400	Yeah.
1495400	1496400	That sounds like...
1496400	1498400	Don't do that especially at the end of St. Colm Posse.
1498400	1500400	Do you have any faggo?
1500400	1501400	Motherfucker!
1501400	1502400	That is a...
1502400	1504400	I can't pronounce faggo either.
1504400	1505400	Okay.
1505400	1506400	What you have is faggo.
1506400	1507400	Faggo faggo.
1507400	1510400	It's a redneck homosexual repellent.
1510400	1511400	Like, off.
1511400	1512400	I don't...
1512400	1514400	No fags on me.
1514400	1516400	I use faggo.
1516400	1519400	And then you...
1519400	1522400	We can say that because I'm pro-gay marriage.
1522400	1523400	Yeah.
1523400	1524400	I don't know.
1524400	1525400	Anytime.
1525400	1527400	I'm 1 eighth Cherokee, so...
1527400	1529400	Yeah.
1529400	1531400	The...
1531400	1534400	Then you went out though and the gig went fun.
1534400	1537400	What was Tila's act and what was her crime up there?
1537400	1542400	She did not show her breasts and she was a woman.
1542400	1544400	That didn't show her cans.
1544400	1545400	Rookie mistakes.
1545400	1546400	Yeah.
1546400	1551400	But I gotta say, like I said, I did worse gigs last summer.
1551400	1554400	I can't believe Juggaloos are sexist.
1554400	1557400	Well, that's the weird thing.
1557400	1561400	If they're mesmerized by magnets, why can't they respect women?
1561400	1562400	No.
1562400	1563400	But here's the thing.
1563400	1564400	They're trying...
1564400	1567400	You know, family and being all inclusive is really important to them,
1567400	1571400	but then they write songs about, you know, chopping women up in the vagina with an axe.
1571400	1574400	Which would be the end of men.
1574400	1576400	Duh.
1576400	1577400	Women have...
1577400	1579400	That's what I don't understand about misogyny.
1579400	1580400	Women have little...
1580400	1582400	They can make little men out of themselves.
1582400	1585400	That's where misogyny comes from.
1585400	1586400	It's the jealousy.
1586400	1588400	Our lines are still open, ladies and gentlemen.
1588400	1591400	Remember, women can make little men.
1591400	1595400	And little women how to make other little women make other little men.
1595400	1598400	It's like a Russian nesting doll, really.
1598400	1600400	You open a woman, there's another woman, and there's another woman,
1600400	1602400	and there's another woman, and there's another woman, and there's another woman,
1602400	1605400	and there's another woman, and eventually one sperm falls out.
1605400	1606400	But...
1606400	1607400	Hence memories.
1607400	1608400	If you have...
1608400	1609400	Let's look at the board.
1609400	1610400	How we doing, Robin?
1610400	1611400	Let's look at the board.
1611400	1613400	How much money have we raised so far for harmontown?
1613400	1617400	We've got a handlebar and a gas tank.
1617400	1619400	One sperm south.
1619400	1620400	So...
1620400	1621400	One tiny sperm.
1621400	1624400	That's like, misogyny is the anger.
1624400	1627400	That would be the loneliest motherfucker in the world.
1627400	1628400	A man's like...
1628400	1630400	Just swimming up a uterus going...
1630400	1631400	This is...
1631400	1632400	This is fucked.
1632400	1634400	There used to be more.
1634400	1636400	Where are we going?
1636400	1638400	There's just one sperm, like...
1638400	1640400	You know who would play that sperm?
1640400	1642400	It's Tom Cruise.
1642400	1645400	He's always in these movies where he's the last man on earth,
1645400	1648400	and he's the sperm that's gonna get it done.
1648400	1651400	Milton Seaman in...
1651400	1654400	Up My Lazy River.
1654400	1656400	Little men make little women.
1656400	1658400	Little women make little men.
1658400	1660400	Fuck that, little women.
1660400	1662400	In a world made of a giant woman.
1662400	1664400	A planet man.
1664400	1667400	The planet vaginal.
1667400	1669400	We're going in.
1669400	1671400	Where is everyone?
1671400	1674400	The fools, they did it!
1674400	1677400	Just one shot of like a Morgan Freeman in shadows going,
1677400	1681400	You're only by the cervix, boy.
1681400	1685400	As a uterus up ahead, I hope you know where you're going.
1686400	1689400	There's 800 penguins waiting by that oval.
1689400	1691400	I'm honored that I share this with Robin Williams.
1691400	1694400	Both of our Morgan Freeman's impressions sound like foghorn leghorn.
1694400	1696400	I know!
1696400	1698400	Another thing to please tell. Call this number now.
1698400	1701400	Sound it a lot like Mike O'Brien.
1701400	1702400	I'll say it, I'll say it.
1702400	1704400	By the end of the show, we'll do a decent Morgan Freeman.
1704400	1705400	I'll say it.
1705400	1708400	I say, son, you're about as sharp as a bowling ball.
1708400	1710400	I say, he's gonna need a slide rule to find that ovary.
1710400	1712400	A slide rule, I say.
1712400	1714400	You're not my real... You're not a real...
1714400	1718400	You're not an old assistant. No, you're not real.
1718400	1720400	Obscure reference to the little chicken hawk.
1720400	1722400	Chicken hawk.
1722400	1725400	This is a much larger uterus than I imagined.
1725400	1728400	Imagine, imagine, imagine.
1728400	1731400	The Carlsbad vagina, vagina.
1731400	1733400	Welcome, welcome, welcome.
1733400	1736400	No, no, don't do it. That's a calcium deposit.
1738400	1742400	Hello, Joe. I thought I was the only sperm left.
1745400	1748400	This cartoon was passed on by every network.
1749400	1752400	Oh, that's the one with the one sperm second.
1752400	1755400	That's a turd! We're in the wrong place!
1756400	1757400	Go back!
1757400	1758400	That's the big reveal.
1758400	1761400	That's the last time you get to drive.
1763400	1765400	And droopy dog has the testicle.
1766400	1768400	Oh, fuck.
1770400	1772400	Before these guys figure out they can leave the stage,
1773400	1774400	we're going to wrap this up.
1774400	1778400	I think I've insulted every group that is organized.
1778400	1780400	Well, I was going to sabotage you guys and bring up our dungeon master
1780400	1782400	and suck you into a game of Dungeons and Dragons.
1782400	1784400	Oh, no, no, no.
1784400	1785400	Oh, no.
1787400	1789400	Listen to them.
1790400	1792400	Listen to the people for once, Robin Williams.
1792400	1795400	Don't stop me on this again!
1795400	1797400	I can't go back.
1797400	1799400	For once in your entire career, Robin Williams,
1799400	1801400	pander to these people.
1801400	1802400	Give them what they want!
1802400	1805400	I know what! I don't have a 20-sided dice, you fucker!
1805400	1807400	Oh, they have them.
1808400	1810400	This whole crowd's sitting on them.
1810400	1813400	Spencer! Spencer Crittenden come to the stage!
1817400	1819400	Oh, dungeon master!
1824400	1825400	All right, we better go now.
1825400	1827400	We can get out of here.
1827400	1829400	Do you want to leave? You can leave.
1830400	1838400	I think the last time I did this, I think I broke it for everybody.
1838400	1839400	No, no, no, no.
1839400	1842400	If you leave it up to me, you're going to be up here forever,
1842400	1844400	so you get to gracefully leave.
1844400	1847400	Thank you so much, Alonzo Roberts!
1847400	1849400	Thank you so much.
1849400	1851400	Thank you so much.
1853400	1856400	Robin Williams and Bob Goldthorne!
1869400	1871400	Here's why I would have kept him up forever,
1871400	1873400	because not just to milk it,
1873400	1876400	because God knows I would have killed it to keep him up here forever,
1876400	1879400	but now I've got to follow.
1879400	1883400	You know, there's a little crest of energy
1883400	1886400	that usually attends a Robin Williams appearance,
1886400	1889400	whether you're watching Comic Relief 7 or...
1889400	1892400	Afterglow, we coast on that energy.
1892400	1894400	We ride that shockwave.
1894400	1896400	Let's smoke a cigarette and go like...
1896400	1898400	What the fuck was that?
1898400	1901400	That was a huge interstellar explosion
1901400	1903400	where we were going to ride that shockwave along the cosmos
1903400	1905400	for quite a long time right now.
1905400	1908400	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Remember all those sperm jokes?
1908400	1911400	Remember that little sperm movie?
1911400	1913400	Like Jelly.
1913400	1915400	Eric, Idol and Robin Williams now have done...
1915400	1917400	Oh, Eric says hi, by the way.
1917400	1919400	I was on the phone with the fuck that guy.
1919400	1922400	Oh, he calls the song that we sang, his song, by the way.
1922400	1924400	He's trying to steal that song.
1924400	1926400	Our Fuck Your Mama song.
1926400	1928400	Yeah, it's like somebody...
1928400	1931400	Because we wrote that song, and then we brought it over to his house,
1931400	1933400	that song that Eric Idol sang.
1933400	1935400	And he picked up a guitar and instantly played it,
1935400	1937400	first time almost exactly as you guys heard it,
1937400	1939400	if you've heard that episode, or you were here that night.
1939400	1941400	And I was talking to him on the phone just now,
1941400	1944400	and he's like, oh, have you guys played my song recently?
1944400	1947400	And I was like, oh, no, no, we only did that one time.
1947400	1949400	He's like, you notice I'm calling it my song.
1949400	1951400	He's like, I sneak that in there, you don't even notice.
1951400	1953400	And I was like, look, man, you can have it.
1953400	1955400	We're not making any money on this.
1955400	1957400	But you told him, you know, people think that that...
1957400	1959400	Yeah, and he was proud.
1959400	1962400	I said, people think you wrote that. He goes, of course they did.
1963400	1964400	He liked the quality.
1964400	1965400	Because it was good.
1965400	1968400	Because an Emmy-winning lyricist, co-pended.
1968400	1969400	Yeah.
1969400	1970400	All right, anyways.
1972400	1974400	Kobe Bryant is here, ladies and gentlemen.
1975400	1977400	April Fools.
1977400	1978400	Spencer, how are you?
1978400	1980400	You were Easter with us at dance?
1980400	1981400	Yeah, yeah.
1981400	1986400	Yeah, I came late because I had a breakdown at Vaughn's.
1986400	1987400	Yeah.
1987400	1988400	Oh, yeah, you mentioned that.
1988400	1991400	I knew I was going to bring it down after that.
1991400	1992400	I'm sorry, you guys.
1992400	1993400	It's cool.
1993400	1994400	Anyway, yeah.
1994400	1996400	You had an emotional breakdown?
1996400	1998400	Yeah, I didn't know what food to bring.
1999400	2001400	All right, well, go into detail here.
2001400	2002400	You walk in the front door.
2002400	2004400	Because first of all, you had to know...
2004400	2007400	Well, like, before that, I was just wrestling with it.
2007400	2010400	Because I make a good cheese dip.
2010400	2013400	You keep talking about this cheese dip that we've never seen.
2013400	2014400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2014400	2016400	You're not...it's not vegetarian, Jeff, so...
2016400	2017400	Well, that's all right.
2017400	2018400	So fuck off.
2018400	2019400	Will you give us the recipe?
2019400	2022400	I mean, one third of a good Hormontown show is Robin Williams' appearance,
2022400	2025400	and another third of a classic Hormontown is a good recipe.
2025400	2027400	Do you honestly want the recipe?
2027400	2028400	Yes, yes, what is it?
2028400	2029400	Okay, okay.
2029400	2032400	Well, first, you take approximately...
2032400	2033400	He's talking.
2033400	2034400	What was this?
2034400	2035400	Who's talking?
2035400	2036400	Oh, he makes good tiny sandwiches.
2036400	2040400	Oh, yeah, I made some cucumber sandwiches for a tea party.
2040400	2042400	It was pretty, pretty...
2042400	2043400	You have little tea parties?
2043400	2044400	No, I don't.
2044400	2045400	That was a one-time thing.
2045400	2046400	And it wasn't...
2046400	2047400	Symphony wasn't...
2047400	2050400	Reaching for the tea.
2050400	2053400	You realize it's 11.
2053400	2056400	Yeah, that's not the first thought that interests people's heads when they look at you.
2056400	2058400	Like, I bet he makes a good tiny sandwich.
2058400	2059400	Yeah, yeah.
2059400	2062400	Cucumber sandwiches, I don't...I mean, she thought they're...
2062400	2063400	I don't think they're that good.
2063400	2064400	They don't taste like much.
2064400	2066400	So you're thinking in your head,
2066400	2068400	I'm going to go over to Harmon's for Easter.
2068400	2070400	If I'm going to go to Harmon's for Easter,
2070400	2072400	I will have brought something.
2072400	2073400	I will have brought value.
2073400	2075400	Because of something that you imposed on yourself,
2075400	2077400	not because you thought that anyone...
2077400	2079400	Because my presence is an imposition.
2079400	2083400	So I come bearing gifts, you know, to cover it up.
2083400	2084400	Interesting.
2084400	2085400	So, yeah.
2085400	2088400	But, yeah, so I mean, I was thinking of the cheese dip,
2088400	2090400	and I was on my couch for a while,
2090400	2092400	and then I got...I was like, I'll figure it out when I get to Von's.
2092400	2094400	I went to Von's, stared at the bacon,
2094400	2097400	stared at the cream cheese, stared at the cakes, you know.
2097400	2099400	When you're staring at bacon, what are you thinking?
2099400	2104400	I'm thinking the bacon cheese dip is going to cost about $13.40 or so.
2104400	2106400	Ah, so you're juggling finances.
2106400	2108400	No, that's just what I was thinking about.
2108400	2110400	And, I mean, I think it was just me being anxious,
2110400	2113400	using any excuse, and price was the excuse.
2113400	2114400	Right.
2114400	2115400	But, I mean, I don't know.
2115400	2118400	Was it performance anxiety that you would wonder if people would like the dip?
2118400	2121400	It was going to be bomb. Don't worry.
2121400	2123400	You know what I think is really ironic about this,
2123400	2126400	is that Dino, who cooked for Easter,
2126400	2129400	who loves to cook, and who's a great comedy writer,
2129400	2133400	the reason he loves to cook, we were talking about it,
2133400	2135400	is that when you cook,
2135400	2139400	it excuses you from all of these things that normally hang up a writer,
2139400	2141400	because you get some broccoli.
2141400	2143400	The broccoli is either going to be used or not used,
2143400	2145400	and in either case it's going to rot.
2145400	2147400	And the best case scenario is it goes in someone's stomach
2147400	2149400	and comes out a turd and goes down a toilet.
2149400	2154400	Like, there is no good reason to get hung up on making a meal.
2154400	2158400	Like, he uses it to release himself from the things that normally hang us up.
2158400	2161400	And here you are, a creator of worlds, of realms,
2161400	2163400	a master of realms,
2163400	2166400	entire dungeons and biographies and lifetimes,
2166400	2168400	holding fate in your very hands,
2168400	2171400	and you're staring at the bacon, and you can't...
2171400	2173400	And the cakes.
2173400	2176400	It hung you up the way that I'm hung up on my Fox script.
2176400	2179400	Like, I'm sitting there going, this has to be the new community.
2179400	2182400	I feel like this audience deserves, while they're waiting in line,
2182400	2184400	a little cheese dip while they're waiting out there.
2184400	2188400	I can bring some. I've honestly thought of that.
2188400	2191400	I'd rather give out the recipe.
2191400	2194400	We should rent a station wagon
2194400	2199400	and have it pull it up to the curb when they're waiting outside the comic book store
2199400	2204400	and then we'll put out a little Sterno cans and give them hot snacks.
2204400	2206400	I think it's illegal.
2206400	2209400	Well, they have taco trucks.
2209400	2211400	Yeah, but those guys have licenses and stuff.
2211400	2213400	No, or they just get shut down.
2213400	2216400	Like, there is an awesome taco truck we used to go to after marketing.
2216400	2219400	The taco truck owner in the back just loses shit.
2219400	2222400	They just get shut down, though. Like, they do. It sucks.
2222400	2223400	Yeah, yeah.
2223400	2226400	Speaking of things that we should do,
2226400	2229400	I flirted with this thing a couple weeks ago,
2229400	2232400	where we said, like, oh, you know, because we keep talking about movies
2232400	2234400	and we watch shitty movies and then we talk about the movies,
2234400	2237400	and then I threw out the idea of, oh, like Oprah's book club,
2237400	2240400	let's assign a movie, and then we can talk about it next week.
2240400	2242400	And I've gotten a couple tweets.
2242400	2245400	More importantly, I do think it's kind of a good idea,
2245400	2247400	because it takes no effort at all.
2247400	2250400	Like, if we could just make up our mind as a group,
2250400	2254400	it's not compulsive, compulsory, but we could just assign a movie.
2254400	2257400	Let's just make up our mind to watch one thing before next recording.
2257400	2258400	What are you thinking?
2258400	2260400	I don't know. Nine to five. I don't know.
2260400	2262400	Do you want it to be schlocky, or do you want it to be great?
2262400	2264400	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
2264400	2265400	I take back nine to five.
2265400	2267400	Any suggestions out there?
2267400	2268400	Robocop.
2268400	2271400	Robocop 2 classic.
2271400	2273400	Wicker Man almost 2.
2273400	2276400	Well, I mean, it's such a fucking like...
2276400	2279400	Let's all watch the six-hour version of Fanny and Alexander.
2281400	2283400	Maybe something will come up organically.
2283400	2286400	Remind me at the end of the show, when I'm standing here like a dumbass,
2286400	2290400	going, how do we end the show if we haven't come up with something organically?
2290400	2293400	Remind me that we haven't yet thought of something,
2293400	2295400	and then I'll at least have something to do before we leave,
2295400	2298400	instead of rapping about fucking your mom.
2298400	2300400	Let's get McGathey up here.
2300400	2302400	McGathey!
2307400	2311400	I love, in a dark, dark, cynical way,
2311400	2316400	I love that Kumail, who's been here for like five weeks in a row,
2316400	2319400	he's got an early call tomorrow, and he always emails me,
2319400	2321400	and goes, like, oh, I'm not going to be able to make it,
2321400	2323400	and like, what did I miss?
2323400	2326400	This is kind of funny. I think he would have enjoyed, probably.
2326400	2329400	I wonder if people that are listening to this know that this is the April Fool's Day episode,
2329400	2333400	and they're going to think that these are really good impressions of those two guys.
2333400	2336400	And it was all Kobe Bryant doing all the voices.
2336400	2338400	It was Andy Dick.
2338400	2340400	Hello, Erin. How are you?
2340400	2342400	I'm doing good. Are they really gone?
2342400	2343400	Yeah.
2343400	2344400	Oh, okay.
2344400	2347400	Yeah, I'm glad that they had the balls to go. Let's get out of here.
2347400	2348400	I suppose.
2348400	2349400	We would've, yeah.
2349400	2351400	I didn't have care to teach for them.
2351400	2352400	Let's play hard together.
2352400	2353400	Yeah.
2353400	2354400	Well, I'm not good at playing hard together.
2354400	2356400	Robin had a good time. Maybe he'll come back again, you know.
2356400	2358400	If we milk him dry, he'll be exhausted, you know.
2358400	2359400	I love that guy.
2359400	2363400	I just couldn't get past the idea of him playing Dungeons and Dragons.
2363400	2365400	It was a little intriguing.
2365400	2372400	I really wanted to ask him to play Lorraine and just let me stand behind him and just smell him.
2372400	2374400	All right.
2374400	2376400	I just met him a couple of nights ago for the first time.
2376400	2378400	That's why he's coming up, messing up my hair.
2378400	2380400	He was being palsy-walsy.
2380400	2381400	That's so adorable.
2381400	2386400	I was doing an improv show at UCD, and I ran backstage really quick because I was doing some sort of dumb bit,
2386400	2389400	and he was standing there, and I was like, ugh!
2389400	2391400	And he's like, ugh, is it okay if I go on stage?
2391400	2392400	I was like, ugh, ugh.
2392400	2396400	And he came out on stage, and then afterwards, it was right after his divorce,
2396400	2400400	and him and I talked about his divorce for a couple hours.
2400400	2401400	I wonder why.
2401400	2402400	The impetus of my podcast.
2402400	2403400	What?
2403400	2404400	What?
2404400	2407400	Nothing. I'm just being jealous.
2407400	2413400	Don't worry. His dick tasted like garbage.
2413400	2414400	No, it didn't.
2414400	2415400	No, I don't know it is.
2415400	2418400	Delicious honey-soaked garbage.
2418400	2421400	Always went in so many directions. So much energy.
2421400	2422400	So many.
2422400	2429400	So, part of his dick did a great Mr. T impression on his balls that had some insights about gay guys.
2429400	2430400	It was great.
2430400	2439400	And he kept on, in our conversation about his ex-wife, he kept on referencing Hook, which I was thrilling.
2439400	2440400	Hey.
2440400	2444400	I love Hook, but I kept on saying, well, like Dustin and Hook, but over and over again,
2444400	2448400	well, when I was doing Hook, I was like, this is the best. No one's around.
2448400	2449400	I totally love him.
2449400	2450400	All right.
2450400	2452400	One more bit of business before we start D&D.
2452400	2454400	Is he really not here?
2454400	2456400	All right. I'm just making sure.
2456400	2457400	Yeah.
2457400	2458400	I don't know what that O was for.
2458400	2461400	I hope it was either going, oh, don't be a starfucker.
2461400	2463400	What about starfucking?
2463400	2466400	Someone heard you talk about divorce with a guy.
2466400	2467400	I know.
2467400	2470400	I really, I really love Robin Williams a whole lot.
2470400	2473400	I feel like he's my father.
2474400	2475400	I'm sure.
2475400	2477400	He's probably still out in the store.
2477400	2478400	Go look.
2478400	2481400	No, I think maybe he's Robin.
2481400	2482400	Yeah. Get out of here.
2482400	2483400	Go marry him.
2483400	2484400	Jesus.
2484400	2486400	Go read Mobius together.
2486400	2489400	I'm sure when Billy Crystal comes by next week, it won't change, right?
2489400	2490400	No, no, no, no.
2490400	2491400	It will change.
2491400	2492400	It will change.
2492400	2493400	Is he still booked?
2493400	2494400	He's coming?
2494400	2495400	Yeah, yeah.
2495400	2498400	Okay, great.
2498400	2502400	One more bit of business that's not going to impress anyone, but it's just too weird to pass up.
2502400	2507400	I feel like God speaks through kind of weird coincidences, and so I have to address it.
2507400	2514400	Last week, in my insane, crazy two-five-hour energy rap at the end of the show,
2514400	2519400	I had to rhyme something like, do it or through it or go to it or something,
2519400	2522400	and I rhymed it with the name Ray Pruitt and immediately said,
2522400	2524400	he's a friend of ours.
2524400	2525400	He is a friend of ours.
2525400	2526400	That's right.
2526400	2529400	He's from Austin, Texas, and he's here tonight by coincidence.
2529400	2531400	Ray Pruitt, come up here.
2531400	2533400	Get on stage, Ray.
2533400	2540400	Just tell people your name's Ray Pruitt, first of all.
2540400	2541400	I got ID.
2541400	2544400	Yeah, well, they won't be able to see that.
2544400	2547400	Yeah, he was behind the eight ball on Orion that rhymed through it,
2547400	2549400	and he said like I was Ray Pruitt.
2549400	2550400	He goes, that's a real person.
2550400	2551400	He's a friend of mine.
2551400	2553400	Yeah, so I knew, like I said, the audience doesn't care.
2553400	2554400	Ray Pruitt, you're in town.
2554400	2560400	You're building something for Coachella, and Ray is a big aficionado of the weird,
2560400	2561400	I would say, right?
2561400	2563400	Let's go with that.
2563400	2566400	Ray was in the news once.
2566400	2568400	Tell them about the parade that you invaded.
2568400	2571400	Oh, that poor town of Leakey, Texas.
2571400	2573400	Leakey, Texas.
2573400	2581400	We did Harlem Globetrotters versus the fake Miss America pageant,
2581400	2586400	and this town is maybe 500 people.
2586400	2589400	It made their newspaper twice.
2589400	2591400	But it was a bunch of guys in drag.
2591400	2595400	It was a bunch of city fruity prutes coming in.
2595400	2598400	Yeah, but it was 30 people, but only two of us were gay.
2598400	2599400	Oh, really?
2599400	2600400	Because I saw the phone.
2600400	2602400	It looks like a gay pride parade broke out in it.
2602400	2604400	Molesting children, flashing people.
2604400	2606400	It made papers in Dallas.
2606400	2610400	I promise, I did not take off a single bit of anything.
2610400	2613400	Pruitt, Pruitt, stay here, because Kumail's not here,
2613400	2614400	and we got a character.
2614400	2616400	Can you play Dungeons and Dragons with us?
2616400	2617400	Yeah.
2617400	2618400	All right.
2618400	2619400	Have you ever played before?
2619400	2620400	When I was nine.
2620400	2621400	All right.
2621400	2622400	Yeah, cool.
2622400	2623400	This is Spencer.
2623400	2624400	Spencer Ray.
2624400	2625400	Spencer's our dungeon master.
2625400	2626400	Hey.
2626400	2627400	I looked at you in the dream room,
2627400	2630400	but I didn't say anything, because I'm awkward.
2630400	2631400	Ditto.
2631400	2632400	Yeah, sorry.
2632400	2633400	All right.
2633400	2634400	Should we let this rip?
2634400	2635400	Let's do it.
2635400	2636400	All right.
2636400	2637400	Let's get those character sheets out,
2637400	2644400	and Spencer, if you would, would you catch us up to speed?
2645400	2649400	Last time, our heroes, after having slain a dragon,
2649400	2652400	picked over the treasure and remains in the room
2652400	2654400	that they were last in.
2654400	2657400	Sensing a break in the action, Sharpie and Christoperk
2657400	2660400	set to work studying the bloody tome once more,
2660400	2662400	trying to uncover its secrets.
2662400	2664400	Mulrain, in a bid to claim the dragon's
2664400	2668400	mystical and magical horns, tied various swords to her limbs.
2668400	2671400	Quickly disrobing and playing a tune on his lute of charming,
2671400	2674400	the barbarian transfixed the party for a time,
2674400	2676400	which led to a short spat.
2676400	2681400	The tension was only broken by Mulrain's successful horn harvest.
2681400	2684400	The ranger presented her prize to the wise wizard,
2684400	2686400	but Sharpie rebuffed her with a reference to bags
2686400	2691400	before climbing a pile of treasure to have a semi-public breakdown.
2691400	2693400	The realization had set in.
2693400	2695400	They were far, far from home
2695400	2699400	and had no way to return to the material plane.
2699400	2701400	Very little happened last episode.
2701400	2703400	Yeah, exactly.
2703400	2706400	It actually turned into kind of an unwitting tribute
2706400	2708400	to reality television.
2708400	2712400	Our guest was Genevieve Pearson from a reality show.
2712400	2714400	What we failed to point out,
2714400	2716400	which would have turned the whole thing in our favor,
2716400	2721400	was that the Dragon Session was very much like a shitty VH1 show.
2721400	2724400	So do we need to take inventory of all of our treasure
2724400	2726400	and move on, right?
2726400	2728400	Yeah, yeah. Let me get these...
2728400	2729400	I should have done that.
2729400	2731400	Oh, Bluetooth or Spencer, that's cool.
2731400	2734400	Ray, to catch you up, you're playing Camille Nanjiani's part.
2734400	2736400	His character is a thief, right?
2736400	2738400	A rogue named...
2738400	2741400	Chris de Bourgh, the guy who wrote The Lady in Red.
2741400	2742400	You're familiar with him?
2742400	2743400	Perfect.
2743400	2745400	He's a one-hit wonder, kind of down on his luck.
2745400	2747400	Does he have lots of stuff?
2747400	2749400	He's obsessed with dicks.
2749400	2753400	Here's some things to talk about while Spencer gets situated.
2753400	2755400	Aaron and I went to Sea World.
2755400	2761400	We went to Sea World in San Diego, irrelevant, more like Sea Booooorld.
2762400	2764400	We would see children cry.
2764400	2766400	We were there to pick up our puppy.
2766400	2769400	Or not pick up, pick out our puppy.
2769400	2772400	It's not at Sea World now.
2772400	2777400	We were 20 miles outside San Diego, where is the place where...
2777400	2781400	I mean, well it's, you know, people go to that lady's place.
2781400	2783400	I'm kidding.
2783400	2787400	We went to this lady's place and she's got, you know, she had the laundry basket full of puppies.
2787400	2793400	And then we met the parents of the puppies and we picked out the puppy, our golden doodle.
2793400	2795400	Yeah, we picked him out.
2795400	2796400	I saw the photo, pretty adorable.
2796400	2798400	We still haven't chosen a name for him yet.
2798400	2801400	Yeah, we were talking about naming him.
2801400	2805400	He reminded us of like an older Jewish comedian.
2805400	2810400	He kind of has a weird, yeah, kind of look, like a Sid look to him, or a George.
2810400	2813400	Lenny, or Saul.
2813400	2815400	Yeah, I like Harvey.
2815400	2817400	Harvey, yeah.
2817400	2820400	Harvey, I like, because unlike the other ones, it won't be like a hipster, like Silver Lake.
2820400	2824400	Like, oh, you named your dog, like an old man's name.
2824400	2827400	Harvey's like, oh, Harvey, Harvey.
2827400	2829400	Can we talk about Leonard?
2829400	2831400	Leonard, oh, Leonard, I didn't...
2831400	2833400	Lenny, I liked, but then I thought Leonard...
2833400	2837400	Dan didn't want to name the dog Leonard because of the character and community he thought it would be, too.
2837400	2839400	He thought people would think that he was...
2839400	2845400	Because every wall of my house, when you come into my home, has community art all over it.
2845400	2852400	And I'm fine with that, but the dog is then named like, hey, Starburns, come here, Starburns.
2852400	2855400	I feel like people might leave sad.
2855400	2856400	Yeah.
2856400	2859400	I just, it has nothing to do with me wanting to create it.
2859400	2863400	I just don't want people to be sad when they come to my house.
2863400	2868400	We also got really excited at the idea of calling the dog Steve Agee.
2868400	2869400	Because he kind of...
2869400	2871400	He kind of looks like Steve Agee.
2871400	2872400	I don't think he'd like that.
2872400	2874400	Steve Agee has a real...
2874400	2877400	He does not like when people compare him to other people.
2877400	2882400	Yeah, I mean, I see somebody out in public, and he looks like Steve Agee, and then I Instagram him and go, hey, it looks like Steve Agee.
2882400	2884400	Did you see my Mexican Doug Benson at the sushi place?
2884400	2885400	Yes, yes, yes.
2885400	2888400	Yeah, there's a guy, I'm telling you, Mexican Doug Benson.
2888400	2889400	Mexican Doug Benson.
2889400	2890400	I like to think...
2890400	2893400	I think Doug Benson would be on board that one.
2893400	2895400	But maybe the dog's name is Harvey.
2895400	2896400	Mexican people, maybe not so much.
2896400	2897400	Right.
2897400	2898400	I mean, why not?
2898400	2903400	Maybe y'all are so much easier to watch from down there.
2903400	2906400	Yeah, it's a tough company up here, man.
2906400	2907400	Yeah.
2907400	2908400	All right, let's do this thing.
2908400	2910400	So let's inventory what we got here now.
2910400	2913400	So the last thing you got was the soul of growth.
2913400	2914400	Right.
2914400	2915400	So that was the important thing.
2915400	2917400	I mean, but you got other stuff, too.
2917400	2918400	What is the soul of growth exactly?
2918400	2920400	You don't know what it is exactly.
2920400	2924400	However, you do...
2924400	2927400	Maureen, do you have knowledge and nature?
2927400	2928400	Yeah, so much.
2928400	2932400	So the thing is, some of you guys have skills called knowledge,
2932400	2936400	which lets you think about the world that your character inhabits
2936400	2938400	and glean some useful information.
2938400	2939400	So Sharpie has some knowledge skills,
2939400	2941400	and I think you have knowledge and nature.
2941400	2943400	So what's your skill rank and knowledge and nature?
2943400	2944400	Seven.
2944400	2945400	Awesome.
2945400	2947400	So you're going to get a plus seven.
2947400	2948400	Thanks.
2948400	2949400	All right.
2949400	2951400	So you discover...
2951400	2952400	I mean, you don't discover.
2952400	2955400	You rack your mind, and you know that the soul of growth
2955400	2957400	is a great artifact of power,
2957400	2960400	and it's supposed to embody, like,
2960400	2963400	the vital force that makes plants grow.
2963400	2965400	It's, like, the reason why plants grow.
2965400	2967400	It has strong associations with druids,
2967400	2971400	and druids love it, and, you know, natural creatures
2971400	2974400	and various things like that, you know, elves and...
2974400	2975400	So we now control...
2975400	2978400	We now have the thing that controls whether or not plants grow?
2978400	2981400	According to the legends and superstitions, of course.
2981400	2982400	But yeah, yeah, definitely.
2982400	2985400	Little do we know, in a few thousand years,
2985400	2988400	this will be available at every home improvement store.
2988400	2993400	It's magic, baby.
2993400	2995400	You talking about Chia Pet?
2995400	2996400	What are you talking about?
2996400	2997400	Just fertilizer.
2997400	2999400	Oh, okay.
2999400	3002400	All right, so let's get the hell out of here.
3002400	3004400	Well, that's the thing.
3004400	3005400	Huh?
3005400	3006400	That's the thing.
3006400	3007400	Okay, I look around for a way to get out.
3007400	3011400	The door that you came in, the massive metal door,
3011400	3016400	has closed itself, and you're entrapped within it.
3016400	3018400	Whose turn is that?
3018400	3019400	Your turn.
3019400	3023400	Can I summon my beloved horse, Coco?
3023400	3026400	Could she maybe bustle the door open?
3026400	3028400	You can definitely summon her.
3028400	3031400	Whether or not she shows up.
3031400	3033400	You don't have to be a jerk about it.
3033400	3036400	Yeah, it's brilliant, because when the horse walks in,
3036400	3038400	we'll go, let's go out that way.
3038400	3039400	The horse could find a way.
3039400	3043400	I'm thinking that the horse could...
3043400	3044400	It's like a sim.
3044400	3046400	If it's out there, it'll try to...
3046400	3048400	Well, that she'll use her hooves,
3048400	3051400	and she'll go, hoo!
3051400	3053400	There's a specific word for this that I'm not remembering.
3053400	3054400	Adam...
3054400	3055400	I love you.
3055400	3058400	I love you.
3058400	3060400	You never watching it?
3060400	3064400	Adam Goldberg called me at 8 a.m. the other morning.
3064400	3065400	Okay, so...
3065400	3067400	How come Adam, since you stopped the show...
3067400	3068400	Sorry.
3068400	3069400	No, it's his fault.
3069400	3073400	How come every week Adam Goldberg comes to the show,
3073400	3076400	and it seems like after every show,
3076400	3079400	he tells us that he's not going to be around anymore?
3079400	3082400	Yeah, so Adam told me last week that he was now a night watchman,
3082400	3084400	and so he wasn't...
3084400	3087400	Okay, but then you said that you weren't able to come to shows
3087400	3089400	anywhere because you were a night watchman.
3089400	3091400	They gave me different days off than I wanted.
3091400	3092400	Okay.
3092400	3093400	Previous to that...
3093400	3095400	These don't murder me.
3095400	3097400	It's all fine.
3097400	3099400	Well, it's okay.
3099400	3100400	It's nice to see you.
3100400	3101400	I know.
3101400	3102400	I know you're not going to murder me.
3102400	3104400	Previous to that, it was that you were going to go work on the shark movie, right?
3104400	3107400	I got fired from that, but I didn't get fired from this yet.
3107400	3111400	But basically, if you look at behavior instead of language,
3111400	3114400	which I prefer to do, you're here every week,
3114400	3117400	and you say every week, I'm not going to be here anymore.
3117400	3119400	It's adorable urgency.
3119400	3121400	You're not an optimist, you're a pessimist,
3121400	3125400	because you call and you say, look, I'm not going to be able to hang out,
3125400	3129400	so we better get it in, because I'm not going to be here.
3129400	3131400	Better get it in.
3131400	3132400	Yeah, better get it in.
3132400	3134400	Better get his dick in.
3134400	3135400	I better get it in.
3135400	3136400	Anyway.
3136400	3138400	All right, so you summon your horse.
3140400	3142400	Nothing happens.
3142400	3144400	The horse doesn't even come?
3144400	3147400	Well, you're like several layers underground in a dungeon,
3147400	3148400	and the way you came in...
3148400	3149400	You're like several layers.
3149400	3150400	That's true.
3150400	3151400	You're faster.
3151400	3152400	And there's no...
3152400	3153400	Dungeon snap.
3153400	3154400	Dungeon snap.
3154400	3157400	So there's no other visible...
3157400	3162400	I look around the walls to try to detect any sort of other egress.
3162400	3167400	The ceilings go up really high past the lighting of the chamber.
3167400	3170400	You can't see how far they go up, but they definitely go up.
3170400	3172400	What about that crack where the dragon came through?
3172400	3173400	I mean, you could go in there.
3173400	3176400	All right, I poke my head down in the crack.
3177400	3179400	You're sliding your head.
3179400	3180400	I poke my head.
3180400	3181400	Play a character.
3181400	3182400	You're not deaf.
3182400	3183400	Just be a character.
3183400	3184400	It's fine, yeah.
3184400	3187400	Sliding your head into the crack.
3187400	3193400	You see the faint demarcations of what appears to be a smallish dragon.
3193400	3195400	A smallish dragon's down there?
3195400	3196400	It appears to be.
3196400	3199400	Maybe I can make it believe it's my child,
3199400	3202400	and I'll be like Khaleesi, and I'll have dragons.
3203400	3205400	These are the demarcations of...
3205400	3207400	Mistspoke.
3209400	3215400	You see the faint outline of a dimly, unlit, dragon-esque shape.
3215400	3217400	This is through a crack of the floor?
3217400	3219400	It's like a chain.
3219400	3222400	So there's a dragon baby in there?
3222400	3223400	I don't know.
3224400	3226400	How so coy?
3226400	3228400	How big is it?
3228400	3231400	I mean, from what you can see, it looks maybe about three feet tall.
3231400	3232400	All right.
3232400	3234400	How far a drop is it down into the cave?
3234400	3235400	It's not a drop.
3235400	3237400	It's about 12 feet in.
3237400	3238400	Oh, okay.
3238400	3239400	So I can just walk into that crack?
3239400	3240400	Yeah.
3240400	3241400	Is there anything else in the cave?
3241400	3242400	Yeah, totally.
3242400	3243400	Let's check it out.
3243400	3244400	All right.
3244400	3246400	Well, you check it out.
3246400	3249400	You see a couple staff-like implements.
3249400	3253400	They look like maybe rods or sticks.
3253400	3256400	Several of them, like five.
3256400	3257400	Yeah, five.
3257400	3258400	Just sticking out of the ground?
3258400	3259400	Yeah.
3259400	3261400	You can't see too well unless you have low light vision.
3261400	3262400	I think I do.
3262400	3263400	Did I?
3263400	3264400	Oh, you can see him just fine.
3264400	3265400	Yeah, he's a gnome.
3265400	3266400	My mistake.
3266400	3267400	Yeah, yeah.
3267400	3268400	I've got low light vision.
3268400	3271400	Typically, I play with a lot of humans.
3271400	3272400	Yeah, anyway.
3272400	3279400	The thing that I was coyly phrasing as a dragon is instead a dragon-shaped statue made out
3279400	3280400	of jade.
3280400	3283400	It's massive, and you can tell it's worth a shit ton of money.
3283400	3284400	Ooh.
3284400	3287400	I detect traps.
3288400	3290400	I think I also do that.
3290400	3291400	Oh, yeah.
3291400	3292400	Oh, yeah.
3292400	3293400	Christopher is coming.
3293400	3294400	Chris, get in here.
3294400	3295400	Check this out.
3295400	3298400	I detect traps at a plus two.
3298400	3300400	Detecting traps as a team.
3300400	3302400	You scarcely, you don't scarcely.
3302400	3307400	You just determine that there don't seem to be any traps.
3307400	3308400	All right.
3308400	3312400	I approach the statue and try to lift it off.
3312400	3313400	It's on the pedestal, sir?
3313400	3314400	It's not.
3314400	3317400	It's just kind of like, it's knocked over.
3317400	3318400	Really?
3318400	3320400	Is it light enough for me to carry?
3320400	3321400	It's very heavy.
3321400	3322400	I mean, you could drag it.
3322400	3323400	Yeah, yeah.
3323400	3324400	You could drag it, but you can't really lift it.
3324400	3326400	Is it worth dragging a giant statue around?
3326400	3330400	I mean, you have a bag of holding, which can, like, when you put it in the bag of holding,
3330400	3332400	it stops being heavy.
3332400	3333400	Okay.
3333400	3334400	I toss the statue in my bag of holding.
3334400	3335400	Yeah, okay, cool.
3335400	3336400	Then there was the sticks, right?
3336400	3337400	The sticks?
3337400	3338400	Right, yeah.
3338400	3343400	So you'd see, two of them are actually javelins, and two of them appear to be bows, and one
3343400	3345400	of them appears to be, like, a quarterstaff.
3345400	3347400	Oh, these are weapons that we can take.
3347400	3348400	Yeah.
3348400	3350400	I mentioned Mulrin's going to want that bow.
3350400	3351400	Can we all fit through this crack?
3351400	3352400	Yeah, yeah.
3352400	3353400	Come on in.
3353400	3354400	All right.
3354400	3355400	The cave is great, you guys.
3355400	3356400	Get in here.
3356400	3357400	Hey, what's going on?
3357400	3358400	I just stole a statue.
3358400	3359400	Ah.
3359400	3361400	You guys can't see as well.
3361400	3362400	Aaron can see good.
3362400	3364400	Jeff can see good.
3364400	3365400	All right.
3365400	3366400	Well, I'm sure I cast light.
3366400	3367400	Okay.
3367400	3372400	I cast it on the end of my thumb.
3372400	3373400	Okay.
3373400	3379400	And I hold my thumb up around like a zippo.
3379400	3381400	That's Dungeons and Dragons funny.
3381400	3383400	It's just natural.
3383400	3386400	Actually, let me do it at the end of one of these staffs that we're stealing.
3386400	3387400	Okay.
3387400	3388400	Oh, yeah.
3388400	3389400	That's easier.
3389400	3394400	The staff you grab that begins glowing appears to be in the shape of a serpent.
3394400	3398400	It feels like snakeskin under your grasp, but firm.
3398400	3399400	Sneaky staff, guys.
3399400	3401400	That's a magic staff, probably, right?
3401400	3402400	Yeah, yeah.
3402400	3403400	Most of them are.
3403400	3404400	Most of them are.
3404400	3408400	You barely ever find a staff in this game that was just like, an old man needed help
3408400	3410400	walking.
3410400	3413400	I kind of, I check out the javelin.
3413400	3415400	There's two javelins.
3415400	3420400	They're inscribed with lightning bolts and they're covered in silver.
3420400	3422400	Okay.
3422400	3426400	I take one of them and, Chris, do you want the other javelin?
3426400	3427400	Yes.
3427400	3429400	I would like a javelin, please.
3430400	3433400	I would like a silver lightning bolt javelin.
3435400	3437400	Then there was the two bows.
3437400	3440400	One of them is a long bow and one of them is a short bow.
3440400	3442400	It would like a bow.
3442400	3445400	You're pretty efficient with the long bow as it happens.
3445400	3446400	Well, I'm a little gal.
3446400	3447400	I'll take the short bow.
3447400	3448400	How about that?
3448400	3449400	Whatever.
3449400	3450400	You don't.
3450400	3451400	What's your dexterity?
3451400	3452400	What's your dexterity?
3452400	3453400	I don't know.
3453400	3454400	Sorry.
3454400	3456400	Where does it say dexterity?
3456400	3457400	It's up at the top left.
3457400	3460400	It's under 14 plus two ability modifier.
3460400	3464400	So you're going to be able to shoot it, but not amazingly, but yeah.
3464400	3465400	All right.
3465400	3466400	I take it anyway.
3466400	3467400	All right.
3467400	3468400	So I take the long bow.
3468400	3469400	There you go.
3469400	3470400	All right.
3470400	3478400	You also see two smallish chests, one of which is very ornate and appears to be leafed in
3478400	3479400	gold.
3479400	3483400	The other is a simple wooden box.
3483400	3485400	I'll detect trap on that.
3486400	3489400	Good, buddy.
3489400	3495400	With your accent, it felt so much like just like a TBS game show.
3495400	3497400	I'll detect trap on that.
3497400	3500400	Howie Mandel goes, all right, let's detect trap on it.
3500400	3504400	It's a boat.
3504400	3506400	You detect no traps.
3506400	3507400	There should be more traps.
3507400	3510400	Well, let's open that sucker.
3510400	3511400	All right.
3511400	3512400	Which one?
3512400	3513400	The wooden one.
3513400	3520400	Opening the wooden chest, you see a pair of dark goggles.
3520400	3522400	Steampunk.
3522400	3525400	I'll put them on.
3525400	3530400	As you put them on, you recognize that you could see perfectly in the dark.
3537400	3538400	Where's my pen?
3538400	3539400	I'm going to write that shit down.
3539400	3541400	I now own see in the dark.
3542400	3543400	He'll add it to you.
3543400	3544400	He'll do it later.
3544400	3545400	He's a dungeon master.
3545400	3547400	That's good for a rogue, though.
3547400	3548400	You're a thief.
3548400	3549400	That's good for you.
3549400	3554400	With your new dark vision, with which you can see in the night, you see at the end of
3554400	3560400	the crack, there seems to be a slight tear that's even darker than black in the back
3560400	3561400	of the cave.
3561400	3568400	Is it a figurative tear, like the tear between justice and vengeance?
3568400	3570400	More literal.
3571400	3574400	Like the tear between a wall and another wall.
3574400	3575400	Yeah, okay.
3575400	3578400	Chris, can you see with those goggles?
3578400	3580400	Can you see through that darker than black crack?
3580400	3581400	You can't.
3581400	3582400	It's the darkest of darks.
3582400	3584400	Can I borrow your thumb there, E.T.?
3584400	3585400	Oh, yeah.
3585400	3588400	Yeah, my serpent staff.
3588400	3589400	I mean, I hold it.
3589400	3590400	Careful.
3590400	3591400	Shield your goggle eyes.
3591400	3595400	I don't want to, you know, zero dark thirty you.
3595400	3598400	Yeah, that's a good point.
3599400	3600400	Does that shed the light?
3600400	3602400	Osama Bin Laden.
3602400	3604400	Sorry, sorry.
3606400	3609400	That's my favorite part of the trailer of that movie, which is the only part of the
3609400	3611400	movie I saw.
3612400	3615400	There's the part of the movie, and I'm assuming it's impossible to do spoilers for
3615400	3619400	Zero Dark Thirty, so that's, I mean, kind of, we know how it ends, but there's a point
3619400	3621400	where they're like, Osama!
3621400	3622400	Osama!
3622400	3623400	Like, we're trying to lure him out.
3623400	3625400	I like to think that's Chris Pratt, right?
3625400	3626400	Okay, from Parks and Rec.
3626400	3627400	Okay.
3627400	3628400	All right.
3628400	3629400	Continue.
3629400	3630400	Yeah, okay.
3630400	3636400	So, as the staff nears the tear, you notice that no light coming into it is exiting.
3636400	3639400	It seems very mysterious.
3639400	3640400	Wait, I'm sorry.
3640400	3644400	I was thinking about vodka and what I just said.
3644400	3645400	So is your character.
3645400	3646400	You weren't paying attention.
3646400	3647400	Okay.
3647400	3648400	Fill him in.
3648400	3649400	Tell him what happened.
3649400	3653400	The light doesn't shine far into this new part of the crack.
3653400	3655400	Is it big enough for people to go through?
3655400	3656400	So are we trying to get out?
3656400	3657400	You can't see it, I guess.
3657400	3661400	We're trying to get out through this crack, as opposed to, like, the door.
3661400	3662400	The door we can't get out.
3662400	3663400	Right.
3663400	3664400	We didn't try.
3664400	3665400	Truth.
3665400	3668400	But it sounded pretty ominous that that door was shut behind us and for good.
3668400	3669400	I mean, maybe.
3669400	3670400	Yeah.
3670400	3672400	I mean, we wouldn't have found the statue in the trunk.
3672400	3673400	I mean, we would have sat there.
3673400	3675400	I mean, these people, you could hear him wanting to kill themselves.
3675400	3676400	Like, you just feel it in the air.
3676400	3677400	Robin Williams came out.
3677400	3679400	He did sperm jokes.
3679400	3681400	It's just, I'm not saying, I'm not being self-defeating.
3681400	3686400	I'm just saying, like, it was good that we didn't spend 48 minutes at a steel door.
3686400	3688400	I think it's good to go through cracks.
3688400	3691400	Him and Bob are dressed the same.
3691400	3692400	Yeah.
3692400	3693400	Yeah.
3693400	3694400	They're very cute.
3694400	3695400	They have the same glasses almost.
3695400	3696400	They're so cute.
3696400	3697400	They're like you and Jeff.
3697400	3698400	Yeah.
3698400	3699400	Yeah.
3699400	3700400	Grey suits.
3700400	3701400	I opened up the ornate trunk.
3701400	3703400	The ornate trunk.
3703400	3704400	Yeah.
3704400	3707400	The golden leafed one, if I'm not mistaken.
3707400	3708400	Correct.
3708400	3709400	Of course.
3709400	3710400	Of course.
3710400	3713400	You see inside, dazzles with a gleaming blue light.
3713400	3714400	It's curious.
3714400	3717400	Service betrays its true nature.
3717400	3719400	It's one of the fragments of power.
3719400	3722400	But what it's doing on this plane, you have no idea.
3722400	3723400	What it's doing is what?
3723400	3725400	On this plane, you have no idea.
3725400	3728400	So how many fragments do we have now?
3728400	3729400	You don't know.
3729400	3730400	Oh, no.
3730400	3731400	Okay.
3731400	3736400	So you had the one initially, the one from Dark Star, and this one.
3736400	3742400	And your dad's last time we met, it was still in his colon.
3742400	3746400	So you know of four, and you have three of them, and there might be more.
3746400	3747400	Okay.
3747400	3748400	There's more, you guys.
3748400	3749400	All right.
3749400	3750400	Sharpie, you take that.
3750400	3751400	You're the magic man.
3751400	3753400	I'll take the fragment.
3753400	3759400	You feel it pulse and shiver in your grasp.
3759400	3761400	And then it stops.
3761400	3762400	All right.
3762400	3763400	Okay.
3763400	3765400	Can that fragment glowing blue light?
3765400	3768400	Will that shed any more light for us in this new chamber?
3768400	3769400	Try it.
3769400	3770400	It stopped.
3770400	3771400	Oh, yeah.
3771400	3772400	Yeah.
3772400	3773400	It did stop already.
3773400	3774400	Oh, shit.
3774400	3775400	Okay.
3775400	3776400	I have serpent light.
3776400	3777400	What the...
3777400	3778400	Yeah.
3778400	3779400	So the serpent light, you put it up like...
3779400	3780400	Here's the hole, right?
3780400	3781400	You put it...
3781400	3782400	This is great for the podcast.
3782400	3785400	You put it close, and the light doesn't shine through it.
3785400	3786400	Right.
3786400	3787400	It's like a magical darkness.
3787400	3788400	Yeah.
3788400	3791400	So it can't be penetrated.
3791400	3794400	But it's big enough for people to go through?
3794400	3796400	I mean, you have to like...
3796400	3798400	You can hoist yourself through it.
3798400	3799400	All right.
3799400	3802400	I say, Sharpie, hold my hand, and I'm going to poke through.
3802400	3805400	And if I yell anything, pull me back out.
3805400	3806400	All right.
3806400	3807400	I'll hold his little hand.
3807400	3808400	Okay.
3808400	3809400	While he pokes through.
3809400	3810400	Yeah.
3810400	3815400	And as I leave, I go, wish me luck, buddy.
3815400	3816400	I know.
3816400	3822400	I'm pretending you said I love you.
3823400	3824400	Are you doing...
3824400	3825400	Empire Strikes...
3825400	3826400	Is that Return of the Jedi?
3826400	3827400	Empire Strikes Back.
3827400	3828400	Community, too.
3828400	3829400	All right.
3829400	3830400	All right.
3830400	3833400	So then I call him a Scruffy-looking nerf herder,
3833400	3836400	and then I go into the thing.
3836400	3839400	Going into the thing, you feel a dark chill come over your body.
3839400	3842400	As your torso goes through the portal,
3842400	3845400	you can tell that you're in another dimension.
3846400	3849400	Oh, shit!
3853400	3854400	Moby.
3854400	3855400	Moby.
3855400	3856400	Moby.
3856400	3857400	Moby.
3857400	3859400	Am I separated from them now?
3859400	3860400	I'm still holding his hand, right?
3860400	3861400	No.
3861400	3862400	You're still like halfway through.
3862400	3863400	You can't see anything.
3863400	3865400	Everything is just like black and gray shapes
3865400	3867400	that are kind of hazy and indistinct.
3867400	3868400	Is there a floor?
3868400	3869400	Is there a surface floor?
3869400	3870400	There is a floor.
3870400	3872400	It's kind of like an ash gray floor.
3872400	3874400	It's almost like the lightest surface in the area.
3874400	3876400	But everything's still like bathed in darkness.
3876400	3880400	Even your dark vision can only kind of make out some of the bits.
3880400	3881400	I don't know.
3881400	3883400	I feel like story-wise, we need to go into the subconscious
3883400	3885400	of this universe that we're in.
3885400	3888400	I think we need to penetrate the darkness.
3888400	3891400	I give his hand a squeeze.
3891400	3893400	He's comforting.
3895400	3896400	So his hand is coming.
3896400	3899400	I'm through the thing, and his hand is in the...
3899400	3900400	Yeah, yeah.
3900400	3903400	The way I figured it, you're more like halfway through it at this point.
3903400	3905400	I guess you could be all the way through it.
3905400	3906400	Okay.
3906400	3910400	I step tentatively all the way through out into the gray floor.
3910400	3912400	The ground is firm beneath your feet.
3912400	3913400	All right.
3913400	3915400	I keep moving as long as I feel his hand.
3915400	3919400	I reach out for Christa Berg's hand.
3920400	3922400	And I hand him my goggles.
3924400	3925400	Okay.
3925400	3926400	To hand to Jeff.
3926400	3927400	I mean...
3928400	3929400	Everybody hold hands.
3929400	3930400	Let's all get in here.
3930400	3932400	I offer the goggles back.
3932400	3933400	Go, give me your hand.
3933400	3935400	Okay, I take his hand.
3935400	3938400	No one's reaching for my hand, so I stick them out
3938400	3941400	out of insecurity and neediness.
3941400	3944400	I pretend that I'm sick and weak.
3944400	3946400	So people will grab my hands.
3946400	3948400	Christa Berg, grab your hand.
3948400	3949400	Thank you.
3950400	3951400	Thank you.
3951400	3952400	All right.
3952400	3955400	So like a field trip leader, if I pull them all in,
3955400	3957400	like we're going through like a...
3957400	3959400	We're all at Disneyland or something like that.
3959400	3961400	Like that show with the magic school bus.
3963400	3964400	Just like that.
3964400	3965400	Call the magic school bus.
3965400	3966400	Yeah.
3966400	3967400	That was a great show.
3967400	3968400	Like that one show with the magic school bus.
3968400	3970400	So we all walk into the new dimension.
3970400	3973400	Slipping through the dark portal, you find yourself
3973400	3975400	in a bank of dark misty haze.
3975400	3977400	The inky black fog obscures your vision
3977400	3979400	and you can't make out your surroundings.
3979400	3982400	You can't even see the rift you came through.
3982400	3986400	Then an indistinct hazy gray disc floats lazily upwards
3986400	3988400	and past the horizon.
3988400	3991400	And for a time, you are bathed in a slightly less
3991400	3996400	form of darkness, the closest you could consider light.
3996400	3999400	This grayish light casts a pitch black shadow onto the floor
3999400	4002400	and you can see your shadow dancing and twitching madly
4002400	4004400	as the grayish light flickers.
4004400	4007400	Suddenly, the shadows on the floor peel off their points
4007400	4009400	of connection with your feet and begin to come away
4009400	4010400	from your body.
4010400	4011400	Uh-oh.
4011400	4012400	Shadows?
4012400	4015400	As your shadows detach, you feel violently ill
4015400	4019400	for an intense few seconds before you even out.
4019400	4022400	You feel like you've been seriously assaulted
4022400	4024400	and weakened from losing your shadow.
4024400	4026400	Jodie Foster dimension!
4026400	4030400	You can just make out your shadows slip away
4030400	4034400	into the dark landscape before the hazy disc falls
4034400	4035400	into the horizon.
4035400	4036400	It's light diminishing to nothing.
4036400	4037400	They stole our shadows?
4037400	4039400	Their shadows, maybe our shadows just left.
4039400	4041400	Peter Pan spell.
4041400	4043400	When do we, when do I mourn Coco?
4043400	4045400	You in the front row on the bow tie, you said something
4045400	4046400	like you knew what this was.
4046400	4048400	No, just Coco's still in the other dimension.
4048400	4049400	Thank you.
4049400	4050400	Thank you.
4050400	4051400	Oh, no.
4051400	4052400	You're worried about ballroom horse.
4052400	4053400	That's what I was thinking about.
4053400	4055400	He said Coco's in the other dimension.
4055400	4058400	My horse, my beloved horse and Jeff's lover
4058400	4061400	is in the other dimension.
4061400	4062400	You should care too.
4062400	4063400	I do.
4063400	4064400	I do care.
4064400	4066400	We had really a special time together.
4066400	4068400	I mean, the last time that you guys were together.
4068400	4070400	I fucked your horse.
4070400	4071400	Couple times, I think, right?
4071400	4073400	Yes, and it was consensual.
4073400	4074400	It was consensual.
4074400	4075400	Oh, that's okay.
4075400	4076400	Yeah.
4076400	4079400	I think I was this T-shirt.
4079400	4080400	Oh, yeah.
4080400	4081400	So, yeah.
4081400	4083400	Can we summon the horse through this different dimension,
4083400	4084400	Spencer?
4084400	4086400	As it happens, you can't at the moment.
4086400	4087400	Hold on.
4087400	4090400	So, so those shadows leaving your bodies
4090400	4093400	has actually caused some ability damage towards you.
4093400	4097400	So I can update your sheet later, but basically...
4097400	4099400	Bigger fish, you guys.
4099400	4100400	Yeah.
4100400	4101400	Horse, horse loss.
4101400	4103400	Sharp versus shadow loss.
4103400	4106400	Sharpie loses four strength and two constitution.
4106400	4109400	Quark loses two constitution and four strength.
4109400	4110400	No, no.
4110400	4112400	Two strength and four constitution.
4112400	4115400	Mulrain loses two strength and three constitution,
4115400	4118400	and Krista Berg loses one strength and four constitution.
4118400	4119400	Jesus Christ.
4119400	4120400	You're vastly weakened.
4120400	4122400	Is constitution just about pooping?
4122400	4123400	What is constitution about?
4123400	4127400	Constitution is your ability to shrug off physical damage
4127400	4131400	or resist your shape being shifted, for instance.
4131400	4134400	Or, you know, if you've been poisoned, that's constitution-based.
4134400	4135400	Health.
4135400	4136400	Yeah, health.
4136400	4137400	Like, your healthiness.
4137400	4139400	Now, what does dancing lights do?
4139400	4141400	Dancing lights conjures...
4141400	4142400	Lights, crowds.
4142400	4143400	A small illusion.
4143400	4144400	That's Coachella.
4144400	4145400	So, like...
4145400	4146400	Yeah.
4146400	4148400	Well, like, you know, like those...
4148400	4149400	I don't know, like...
4149400	4151400	To, like, to dazzle enemies to, like, kind of like...
4151400	4153400	It's more like you can play...
4153400	4154400	It'd be weird.
4154400	4157400	It's like, you know, the Tinker Bell, like,
4157400	4160400	being a floaty light that shows up?
4160400	4163400	It looks kind of like that, except there's more of them.
4163400	4164400	It's a bullshit.
4164400	4165400	It's bullshit.
4165400	4167400	It's minor illusory magic.
4167400	4168400	It can make, like, little things.
4168400	4170400	It would dazzle, like, kind of dumb people
4170400	4173400	or, like, people that weren't aware of magic and stuff.
4173400	4175400	But, like, people who are, like, up in magic, they're like,
4175400	4179400	hey, I have a silent image, so fuck off.
4179400	4180400	It's horse shit.
4180400	4181400	It's bullshit.
4181400	4186400	Is there still that pitch-black shadow in the middle of the room?
4186400	4187400	No.
4187400	4188400	Wasn't there some big thing that would...
4188400	4189400	There's a disc in the middle of the room.
4189400	4190400	The disc was...
4190400	4192400	Shadows have detached, and we have stomach aches.
4192400	4193400	Yeah.
4193400	4195400	So, and now you're outside.
4195400	4197400	You can tell, like, you're outside.
4197400	4199400	I should have mentioned that. I'm sorry.
4199400	4201400	That disc that rose, is that kind of like a nighttime sun?
4201400	4202400	Yeah.
4202400	4203400	Like bizarro sun.
4203400	4204400	That was what I was going for.
4204400	4205400	Yeah, yeah.
4205400	4206400	What do you mean? What?
4206400	4208400	The disc that rose that's casting some tiny bit of light
4208400	4210400	is, like, a weird dark sun.
4210400	4211400	Oh, it's not in the middle.
4211400	4212400	No, sorry.
4212400	4214400	I was picturing, like, a giant dinner plate.
4214400	4215400	My narration was a lot.
4215400	4218400	It rose up off of the horizon into the sky.
4218400	4219400	Okay.
4219400	4220400	So, it was demarcated.
4220400	4222400	It cast a light, and then it left.
4222400	4224400	I put on my fancy goggles,
4224400	4228400	and then tell everybody in a narration voice what I see.
4228400	4229400	You see.
4229400	4231400	Tell them what you see.
4231400	4234400	The ground around you is rather unadorned,
4234400	4236400	but to the, what I'm going to call north,
4236400	4240400	for sake of maps, you see a stand of black columns.
4240400	4243400	They poke stiffly out of the ground.
4243400	4247400	You also hear a far-off sound.
4247400	4249400	I can't make the sound with my mouth.
4249400	4250400	Can you, can we...
4250400	4251400	Ah!
4251400	4252400	That was me making a present.
4252400	4253400	Can you send off your bird?
4253400	4254400	Can you send off Avenger?
4254400	4255400	Avenger.
4255400	4256400	Is Avenger there?
4256400	4257400	Avenger.
4257400	4258400	Yeah, he's here.
4258400	4260400	Avenger, how did you handle having your shadow detached?
4260400	4262400	Avenger's shadow was detached.
4262400	4263400	Oh.
4263400	4265400	He's immune to shadow detachment.
4265400	4266400	Humblebrag.
4269400	4275400	Avenger, fly up and give me a hawkside view.
4275400	4277400	It's not long before he returns.
4277400	4279400	He gives you a look that says,
4279400	4280400	the higher up I get,
4280400	4282400	the less I can see of the ground below,
4282400	4285400	but there's definitely a black shape approaching us swiftly.
4285400	4287400	Uh-oh.
4287400	4288400	Spaghetti-o.
4288400	4290400	A black shape approaching us.
4290400	4291400	Soon it's upon you.
4291400	4293400	Now it's upon you.
4293400	4294400	Whoa, Jesus.
4294400	4296400	What the fuck?
4296400	4297400	All right.
4297400	4299400	Does my javelin have any magic powers or anything,
4299400	4301400	or is it just a straight-up javelin?
4301400	4302400	The javelin you found?
4302400	4303400	Yeah.
4303400	4305400	I mean, yeah, it has magic.
4305400	4306400	You don't know much about the magic it has.
4306400	4308400	I said, let's see what this baby can do,
4308400	4309400	and I take my javelin out,
4309400	4311400	and I toss it toward the direction of the dark figure.
4311400	4312400	All right.
4312400	4315400	Is that too preemptive?
4315400	4316400	I don't know, man.
4316400	4318400	Well, you miss.
4318400	4319400	Okay, go.
4319400	4321400	I mean, I'll tell you one thing.
4321400	4323400	I think we attacked that dragon too soon,
4323400	4325400	a couple weeks ago.
4325400	4326400	Really?
4326400	4327400	Out of game comment, yeah.
4327400	4329400	I don't want a Monday morning quarterback,
4329400	4330400	but a dragon came out and said,
4330400	4331400	oh, what morsels do I smell?
4331400	4332400	And then...
4332400	4333400	In his prison.
4333400	4334400	He said it was his prison.
4334400	4335400	We just wailed on it.
4335400	4336400	We never tried to talk to him.
4336400	4338400	And then you were locked in his prison.
4338400	4339400	True.
4339400	4340400	If a dragon speaks English,
4340400	4341400	just have a conversation.
4341400	4342400	Most dragons speak English.
4342400	4343400	He spit acid at us instead.
4343400	4344400	No, after.
4344400	4345400	That was after.
4345400	4346400	I don't want a Monday morning quarterback.
4346400	4349400	Well, then can I use wild empathy on the shadow?
4349400	4350400	Yeah.
4350400	4351400	I do that.
4351400	4353400	It seems to have a very familiar soul.
4353400	4354400	Uh-oh.
4354400	4355400	Oh.
4355400	4356400	Sorry, my bad.
4356400	4357400	Sorry, everybody, cool it.
4357400	4359400	Everyone, familiar soul.
4359400	4361400	It's a good thing you rolled a three, Jeff.
4361400	4362400	I tried it.
4362400	4364400	It doesn't even know you were...
4364400	4366400	It just looks like you were like,
4366400	4369400	but stay here tonight.
4369400	4371400	Can I go run over and grab my javelin kind of
4371400	4374400	surreptitiously and stick it back in my bag of holding?
4374400	4376400	Can we put on a talent show for the shadow?
4376400	4377400	Misplacement javelin.
4377400	4379400	Everyone notices, and it's pretty embarrassing.
4379400	4382400	All right.
4382400	4386400	But yeah, the shape approaches and stands next to Mulrane.
4386400	4387400	Hey!
4387400	4389400	It stays there.
4389400	4390400	Hey, guys.
4390400	4392400	Why don't we show them what we're made of
4392400	4398400	and do a little talent show or...
4398400	4403400	What?
4403400	4405400	Who's them?
4405400	4407400	Who is them?
4407400	4409400	The dark shadow came up to you.
4409400	4410400	Show him the shadow.
4410400	4412400	Show the shadow who we're made of.
4412400	4413400	Interact with the shadow.
4413400	4414400	Talk to it or something.
4414400	4415400	Fine.
4415400	4416400	Hey, little shadow.
4416400	4418400	It looks at you.
4418400	4422400	Oh, I should have mentioned...
4422400	4424400	It's because it showed up so fastly.
4424400	4426400	It's in the shape of a horse.
4426400	4428400	Oh!
4428400	4430400	Oh, hello.
4430400	4431400	Dear shadow.
4431400	4434400	I almost killed your horse.
4434400	4435400	Your horse.
4435400	4437400	That's the second time.
4437400	4441400	It does appear to be made of shadow and substance.
4441400	4445400	Dear shadow, I love anything that's shaped
4445400	4449400	like you were shaped, so hey.
4449400	4453400	Also, I am with a party of very good souls.
4453400	4456400	We have a gentleman who is searching for his father.
4456400	4463400	We have a one-hit wonder who is looking to numb some dragon dicks.
4463400	4471400	And we have a little gentleman who loves some things.
4471400	4473400	Is this cocoa or not?
4474400	4475400	Oh, my God.
4475400	4476400	Is it cocoa?
4476400	4477400	It might be cocoa.
4477400	4478400	Holy shit.
4478400	4479400	Cocoa.
4479400	4482400	Cocoa, if it's you, flare your tail.
4482400	4485400	Flare your tail if it's you, cocoa.
4485400	4486400	It flares its tail.
4486400	4488400	Cocoa!
4488400	4490400	But I think about my dad.
4490400	4492400	I think a lot about my dad.
4492400	4494400	I'm looking for my dad.
4494400	4496400	I wish my dad was around.
4504400	4507400	Instead, you fall back on your arcane training
4507400	4510400	and recognize that you're on the shadow plane.
4510400	4515400	The shadow plane is a copy plane of the material plane.
4515400	4518400	And as such, things have shadow versions of themselves.
4518400	4520400	Oh, so this is shadow cocoa?
4520400	4521400	Yeah.
4521400	4523400	But does it correspond to the real cocoa?
4523400	4524400	Yeah.
4524400	4525400	So this is like...
4525400	4527400	But we can't hold her?
4527400	4528400	No, you can.
4528400	4529400	Shadows are...
4529400	4530400	I mean, we'll try to...
4530400	4531400	Let's just try to hold her.
4531400	4532400	How about...
4533400	4534400	I try to hold her.
4534400	4536400	I could just explain what happens,
4536400	4539400	but that'd be just me telling a shitty story.
4541400	4545400	I reach up and I look at Quark.
4545400	4547400	I hold his hand because I know that he's also
4547400	4549400	emotionally invested in cocoa.
4549400	4552400	And I throw my arm around Cocoa's neck
4552400	4554400	and we both look at each other because, you know,
4554400	4557400	she's my friend and she's your lover.
4557400	4559400	And we look at Cocoa's face.
4560400	4563400	It doesn't look back, I mean.
4563400	4564400	But, yeah.
4564400	4566400	So this is the shadow version of cocoa.
4566400	4568400	So our shadows ran off.
4568400	4570400	So our shadow versions of ourselves have left us
4570400	4572400	to go do who knows what.
4572400	4574400	Do we need to reunite with our shadows?
4574400	4578400	Well, I mean, if you don't mind minus two to strength
4578400	4581400	and minus four to constitution, you're probably fine.
4581400	4582400	Oh.
4582400	4584400	But, yeah, I mean, it's whatever.
4584400	4585400	Okay.
4585400	4588400	Try to get on your horse, see what happens.
4589400	4593400	I try to jump on my shadow horse.
4594400	4596400	Leaping a straighter shadow horse,
4596400	4598400	it feels comfortable underneath you.
4598400	4599400	Oh.
4599400	4602400	It doesn't try to buck you off and instead regards you
4602400	4604400	as a trusted friend or ally.
4604400	4606400	Have Cocoa lead us to the pillars.
4606400	4609400	Cocoa, can you lead us to the pillars?
4609400	4611400	It doesn't make any response,
4611400	4613400	but slowly it begins to trot forward.
4613400	4616400	Well, but is that their response?
4616400	4617400	Is that her response?
4617400	4618400	Is she trots forward?
4618400	4619400	I'm just spoilers.
4619400	4623400	Shadow Cocoa can't communicate there.
4623400	4625400	I shouldn't have said it.
4625400	4626400	I said it.
4626400	4628400	I'm sorry, D&D aficionados.
4628400	4631400	We need all the help we can get through this.
4631400	4632400	The question.
4632400	4634400	No, not like the question of whether or not
4634400	4637400	she's communicatable with because she's silent.
4637400	4638400	Right.
4638400	4639400	Shadows are silent.
4639400	4641400	No, you're only giving us the, I mean, you know,
4641400	4643400	you're giving us the information that it would have taken us
4643400	4645400	10 minutes to figure out through trial and error.
4645400	4646400	Yeah.
4646400	4647400	Which is whether or not the horse can understand us.
4647400	4650400	I didn't want you to feel like you were being like,
4650400	4653400	you know, cold-treatmented by your horse.
4653400	4655400	It just doesn't talk.
4655400	4656400	Well, that's nice.
4656400	4660400	Robin and Bobcat really dodged a bullet tonight, didn't they?
4660400	4663400	I was like, what characters are they going to be?
4663400	4664400	Oh, man.
4664400	4665400	Robin Williams is the Shadow Horse?
4665400	4668400	Are you kidding me?
4668400	4671400	Oh, Mr. Happy, I don't know.
4671400	4672400	Get on board.
4672400	4673400	Oh, my God.
4673400	4678400	My Shadow Horse is George Plimpton.
4678400	4680400	Bill Plimpton?
4680400	4681400	I'm going to follow that horse.
4681400	4682400	All right.
4682400	4684400	So we follow Koko off in the direction
4684400	4686400	of the five dark pillars.
4686400	4687400	There's more than five, but yeah.
4687400	4688400	Oh, okay.
4688400	4689400	Well, we go that way.
4689400	4690400	How far off are they?
4690400	4693400	I'd say it would take you a good 30 minutes.
4693400	4694400	Should we call it rotten?
4694400	4696400	Should we call that an act break?
4696400	4697400	Yeah.
4697400	4698400	We started earlier.
4698400	4699400	Just made it in typical.
4699400	4700400	Okay.
4700400	4701400	All right.
4701400	4702400	Okay.
4702400	4705400	We're there.
4705400	4713400	I plant a giant blue flag that I sew out of my own sadness,
4713400	4718400	and I draw a picture of myself, and I look at it,
4718400	4721400	and that's like a bookmark for where we were.
4721400	4722400	Before you leave?
4722400	4723400	Right.
4723400	4724400	Oh, yeah.
4724400	4725400	Yeah.
4725400	4726400	Okay.
4726400	4727400	I approach Sharpie and I ask if he's okay.
4727400	4728400	Oh.
4728400	4729400	You're being trotted away on a horse.
4729400	4730400	Oh, well, never mind.
4730400	4731400	I don't do that.
4731400	4733400	You could take it around, like control it.
4733400	4734400	Okay.
4734400	4735400	I take my horse around.
4735400	4742400	I circle around like a knight, and I go up to Sharpie,
4742400	4745400	and I say, huh, are you okay?
4745400	4747400	Yeah, I'm all right.
4747400	4748400	You know what?
4748400	4749400	Thank you.
4749400	4751400	I'm going to try something.
4751400	4754400	I start digging into the dirt with my hand.
4754400	4755400	Okay.
4755400	4760400	I dig down like 12 inches, like a full foot.
4760400	4763400	That's going to take you a while, but yeah.
4763400	4764400	Well, I wait.
4764400	4766400	Well, you dig.
4766400	4767400	What?
4767400	4768400	You dig.
4768400	4769400	I dig.
4769400	4770400	You don't wait.
4770400	4771400	I dig.
4771400	4772400	Yeah.
4772400	4774400	I, as a player, wait for my character to dig.
4774400	4775400	Digging complete.
4775400	4778400	I spit into it.
4778400	4779400	That happens.
4779400	4784400	What the hell is going on?
4784400	4791400	I drop my wineskin into it.
4791400	4792400	Okay.
4792400	4793400	Into the hole.
4793400	4794400	Uh-huh.
4794400	4795400	I bury it.
4795400	4796400	Okay.
4796400	4799400	I pee on the spot where I buried my wineskin.
4799400	4800400	Yes.
4800400	4804400	I'm still sitting on my horse, and I do a like, cool, cool, cool,
4804400	4807400	and just like slowly trot away.
4807400	4810400	You just put more vodka all over your character.
4810400	4811400	I ask Quark.
4811400	4815400	I say, listen, I have a theory about the shadow plane.
4815400	4819400	Can you dig up my wineskin?
4819400	4820400	Me?
4820400	4821400	Yeah.
4821400	4822400	The one you peed on?
4822400	4823400	I have a theory.
4823400	4824400	Okay.
4824400	4827400	I take out all my swords, and so don't get my hands dirty
4827400	4829400	and I dig up the pee pee wineskin.
4829400	4830400	You can't do it with your sword.
4830400	4831400	Oh, okay.
4831400	4833400	Well, I had to dig through your pee?
4833400	4836400	Do you want the theory to be tested or not?
4836400	4837400	Okay.
4838400	4841400	I'm pretty certain that I've fallen for something
4841400	4843400	on an April Fool's Day D&D.
4843400	4845400	I start digging through the pee pee soil,
4845400	4848400	and then I unearth the wineskin.
4848400	4850400	Your hands are filthy.
4852400	4854400	The wineskin comes out.
4854400	4857400	It looks noticeably aged, but otherwise unharmed.
4857400	4859400	Aged from when it buried it?
4859400	4860400	Yeah.
4860400	4861400	Like it aged extra?
4861400	4862400	Yeah.
4862400	4863400	See?
4864400	4868400	Well, if you take a lot of things and put them in dirt and pee,
4868400	4870400	they look older.
4871400	4873400	It's called distressing, like a cabinet.
4873400	4874400	I don't know.
4874400	4875400	I don't know.
4876400	4878400	What the fuck are you doing, man?
4878400	4881400	I was going to do April Fool's and then you ruined it.
4883400	4887400	I wanted to end the game in a laugh
4887400	4889400	and just say April Fool's.
4889400	4891400	And then you go, I got a feeling this is April Fool's.
4891400	4892400	I dig through the pee.
4892400	4895400	And then he's like, whoa, that's got a magic hummingbird on it.
4895400	4896400	Now I don't know what the fuck to do.
4896400	4898400	I was going to make it a genie.
4899400	4901400	If you're going to do April Fool's joke on April Fool's,
4901400	4903400	don't make it that lame.
4904400	4908400	You have a little grin like I pee on it.
4909400	4910400	I had a theory.
4910400	4911400	I'm not good at that stuff.
4911400	4914400	I don't normally, I don't do that stuff.
4915400	4917400	I pee on everybody here.
4917400	4918400	I pee on everybody.
4918400	4919400	I start peeing on everybody.
4919400	4920400	That's not an April Fool's trick.
4921400	4924400	But I tell him, I tell him it's gold.
4924400	4927400	I go, I'm going to put gold on you with my wiener.
4927400	4929400	And then I start peeing.
4929400	4931400	They're not convinced.
4931400	4933400	It's gold. It's gold, you guys.
4933400	4934400	I use dodge.
4934400	4935400	I use my ability to dodge.
4935400	4938400	It's gold coming out of my wiener.
4938400	4940400	April Fool's.
4943400	4944400	End of segment.
4944400	4945400	All right.
4946400	4947400	Put a finger.
4948400	4950400	Thank you, Eric McGathey.
4950400	4951400	Thank you, Ray Pruitt.
4954400	4955400	Ray Pruitt, everybody.
4955400	4956400	Good luck at Coachella, then, buddy.
4958400	4959400	Good luck at Coachella.
4960400	4961400	What the hell is Coachella, Jeff?
4961400	4962400	I don't know.
4962400	4963400	It's a thing where people, it's like...
4963400	4966400	It's like Lollapalooza, but not for 40-year-olds, right?
4966400	4967400	I don't know.
4968400	4971400	You dress up weird and you drive around in a big thing that you made.
4971400	4972400	That's everything.
4972400	4977400	Name one thing where you drive around in a weird thing.
5002400	5004400	For credit card customers, please call...
5032400	5046400	It's a good deal.
5046400	5047400	All right.
5047400	5048400	How do we end the show?
5048400	5049400	What's the movie?
5049400	5050400	Oh, yeah.
5050400	5051400	Oh, the movie.
5051400	5052400	Okay. Thank you, sir.
5052400	5053400	Well done.
5053400	5054400	Thank you.
5054400	5055400	All right.
5055400	5056400	So, yeah.
5056400	5057400	What are the parameters now for...
5057400	5058400	You want the audience here to all...
5058400	5059400	We're all going to watch it.
5059400	5060400	Then we're all going to come back and then we're all going to just...
5060400	5061400	It's just something to discuss.
5061400	5062400	It's a book club.
5062400	5063400	It's interesting.
5063400	5065400	Usually I go like, oh, I was watching...
5065400	5066400	You know what I watched the other day?
5066400	5067400	It was Robocop 3.
5067400	5070400	And then there's like 20 people like, oh, I saw that last week.
5070400	5073400	And then two more people saw it six months ago.
5073400	5075400	And then some people have never seen it.
5075400	5079400	For aficionados, I mean, these guys show up on Monday nights pretty regularly.
5079400	5085400	I think if we said, hey, let's all make time this week to watch, blah, blah, blah,
5085400	5087400	we would increase the odds.
5087400	5088400	There would be more connection.
5088400	5090400	We would be able to discuss something.
5090400	5091400	I don't know.
5091400	5092400	It's just a thought.
5092400	5093400	Well, it's just a thought.
5093400	5094400	It's not a good thought.
5094400	5095400	It's not...
5095400	5100400	You know, God, when God was creating the universe, he just made it up.
5100400	5101400	He didn't like...
5101400	5103400	He just thought stuff.
5103400	5106400	He didn't think of stuff that he knew would work.
5106400	5107400	Is that right?
5107400	5108400	Yeah.
5108400	5110400	How'd you know that?
5110400	5112400	Well, because obviously it was the first time he did it.
5112400	5113400	Otherwise there was nothing...
5113400	5114400	How'd you know that?
5114400	5116400	Well, because he did it.
5116400	5117400	Otherwise it's dumb.
5117400	5120400	Why would he even write a Bible about it if he didn't...
5120400	5122400	It's got to be special, right?
5122400	5124400	There was nothing.
5124400	5127400	It specifically says there was nothing.
5127400	5130400	And then it says that he started making shit up.
5130400	5133400	Yeah, it's kind of like your pee on the wineskin thing.
5133400	5138400	It wasn't Eve, just mud and spit and ribs and stuff like that.
5141400	5142400	Do you believe in God, Jeff?
5142400	5146400	Do you think that there's an intelligence to the cosmos?
5146400	5151400	I think there is, but in a way that we'd be totally incapable of totally understanding.
5151400	5153400	Yeah, I think there's a system of some kind.
5153400	5154400	What's the old line?
5154400	5157400	If God were simple enough to understand, we'd be too simple to understand.
5157400	5160400	Even if that system is simply just like...
5160400	5164400	Like it's just kind of a throbbing jellyfish.
5164400	5165400	Yeah, but that is the cool thing.
5165400	5171400	Scientists are out there working and looking smaller and smaller and smaller and building these giant things in Vienna or wherever the fuck.
5171400	5175400	Smashing particles together to figure out what the fucking point of it all is.
5175400	5178400	Like, why is there mass? Why is there matter?
5178400	5179400	That is nice of them to do that.
5179400	5180400	Yeah.
5181400	5183400	Well, I play Bioshock Infinite.
5184400	5185400	All right!
5185400	5187400	I bought that today.
5187400	5190400	I had my assistant go out and get it.
5190400	5192400	I'm distressed about one thing.
5192400	5198400	Our web guy, Sharouz, I think I heard third hand that he finished it in 25 hours.
5198400	5200400	But I think I also...
5200400	5202400	Adam, why do you applaud things at random?
5202400	5204400	You're not even supposed to be here.
5205400	5207400	By your own report.
5207400	5208400	You're like...
5208400	5210400	Every week, Adam's like,
5210400	5212400	I'm sorry, I'm going off to Afghanistan.
5213400	5215400	Guess you'll have to be my friend tonight.
5215400	5216400	You never know.
5216400	5218400	And then next week, there he is.
5218400	5219400	Bioshock, good guy!
5219400	5220400	Yay, Sharouz!
5220400	5221400	What the fuck are you...
5221400	5222400	I like Sharouz.
5222400	5223400	All right, I like him too.
5223400	5224400	Shut up.
5225400	5227400	But anyways, whatever.
5227400	5228400	Who cares?
5229400	5233400	You know, Skyrim, it's like hundreds and hundreds of hours if you want it.
5233400	5237400	But I think maybe Sharouz is like a crazy computer head.
5237400	5239400	And he...
5239400	5242400	I bet you can barrel through the A story of a good game in 25 hours.
5242400	5243400	I don't know.
5244400	5247400	I'm playing a little game on my iPhone.
5248400	5249400	Pocket planes?
5249400	5251400	I'm playing Candy Crush.
5253400	5254400	Pretty good.
5254400	5255400	How many hours?
5255400	5256400	I put a lot.
5258400	5260400	But they make you do this thing.
5262400	5265400	You're a little girl and you're going around Candyland.
5265400	5269400	And you're blowing up little jellies and making little candies explode.
5269400	5271400	And then there's chocolate tries to eat your candies.
5271400	5275400	And there's little Mr. Willy Wonka kind of character leading you through it.
5275400	5277400	And then if you get past a certain level,
5277400	5279400	you either have to pay money to go forward
5279400	5282400	or invite friends on Facebook, which I don't use.
5282400	5285400	So I went on Facebook and tried drunk at Easter yesterday
5285400	5287400	to get free lives out of people.
5287400	5289400	Because I don't go on Facebook and fuck them.
5289400	5293400	I'll ask Tammy two-tone that I've never fucking met.
5295400	5298400	Not only did I ask everybody I know to fucking give...
5298400	5301400	I tell them that Jeff Davis now plays Candy Crush.
5302400	5306400	But every time I pass a level, it's just flooding people's inbox.
5306400	5308400	Jeff's on level 40.
5309400	5310400	A little candy cane.
5310400	5312400	Jeff just slid down the candy cane chute.
5313400	5315400	Jeff beat the peppermint puppy.
5316400	5317400	And now people are like,
5317400	5320400	Hey, Jeff, it sounds like you really can't get an ass on Candy Crush.
5322400	5325400	So then I got up, I saw that text and ran into my computer,
5325400	5327400	just like, undo, remove, remove.
5329400	5330400	That's amazing.
5330400	5332400	So now I'm paying these fuckers, and that's what they want.
5332400	5333400	They're playing on my ego.
5333400	5335400	It's like, are you a total douchebag
5335400	5337400	and you're willing to tell everybody that you play Candy Crush
5337400	5340400	or are you going to pay 99 cents?
5340400	5343400	I've said before, all my favorite games on the iPad and iPhone,
5343400	5345400	they're all these so-called time management games,
5345400	5350400	which are all very specifically, clearly driven,
5350400	5353400	or what do you call it, targeting a female audience.
5353400	5355400	And I am not sexist by saying that
5355400	5357400	because the names of the games that I love
5357400	5361400	are Susie's Sauna, Fiona's Flowers,
5361400	5363400	and Maggie's Magic Shop.
5363400	5366400	But it's always like this cute little girl
5366400	5368400	with a different kind of hat on,
5368400	5370400	and it's like, she got a new job at a pizza place,
5370400	5372400	and help her make her pizza place.
5372400	5374400	And you point and she goes over there,
5374400	5376400	and it's like gobble, gobble, gobble.
5376400	5378400	This guy needs a pizza.
5378400	5380400	And it's like, oh, you make the pepperoni over here,
5380400	5383400	and you've got to figure out how to help her.
5383400	5385400	She's got to bust the tables.
5385400	5388400	If you just have her be disorganized,
5388400	5390400	it's weird because...
5390400	5392400	What do you think they're playing to in the female mind there?
5392400	5394400	Well, I don't know about the female mind
5394400	5397400	because obviously they've got me hooked.
5397400	5402400	I don't know why they don't neutralize the gender thing.
5402400	5404400	I think that's really weird
5404400	5408400	because I'm this big fat Harry, Ron Jeremy-looking guy
5408400	5410400	sitting in bed playing this thing.
5410400	5416400	The fact that they call it Susie's sunflower patch,
5416400	5419400	I feel like they're cutting themselves off.
5419400	5421400	I don't know.
5421400	5423400	I don't know why they think that that's a woman thing.
5423400	5425400	I think I've made a mistake by removing Facebook.
5425400	5427400	I forgot that I have this podcast as a platform.
5427400	5430400	I could just say to people, give me lives on Facebook.
5430400	5433400	You can send me candy lines.
5433400	5435400	Everybody send Jeff...
5435400	5437400	Even if just spiritually,
5437400	5440400	just send Jeff a candy life tonight.
5440400	5442400	Just close your eyes.
5442400	5444400	Even if you're not playing candy,
5444400	5446400	candy jam, what's it called?
5446400	5447400	Yeah, Candy Crush.
5447400	5448400	Candy Crush.
5448400	5450400	Just send Jeff a candy candy life.
5450400	5451400	Anybody else?
5451400	5452400	No one else, Candy Crush?
5452400	5453400	Yeah?
5453400	5454400	Yeah, a couple dudes?
5455400	5457400	Maybe there's some kind of weird...
5457400	5459400	Maybe they know exactly what they're doing.
5459400	5462400	Maybe 60% of their customers are men.
5462400	5463400	Probably.
5463400	5464400	Who knows?
5464400	5466400	We feel actually more beckoned to
5466400	5469400	than if they called it Bro-Down, you know.
5469400	5472400	Then we would go, no, forget it.
5472400	5474400	Actually, kind of like...
5474400	5476400	Yeah, I look at a game and I say,
5476400	5479400	Susie's Island tropical flower patch.
5479400	5482400	And I go, I bet that's one of those games I like.
5482400	5484400	It's got all the earmarks.
5484400	5486400	It's got a little girl with a little haircut.
5486400	5490400	She's got things to do and you've got to help her.
5490400	5492400	Yeah, when you lose a round,
5492400	5494400	there's a little girl and she's like crying.
5494400	5495400	Yeah, help her.
5495400	5496400	Give her a hand.
5496400	5499400	She's got an island to plant.
5499400	5500400	What's the movie?
5500400	5501400	A movie.
5501400	5502400	Anybody else?
5502400	5503400	Roadhouse?
5503400	5504400	Roadhouse.
5504400	5505400	Roadhouse is a fucking goodie.
5505400	5506400	I like that.
5506400	5507400	That is a good movie.
5507400	5508400	I like that.
5508400	5509400	Face off.
5509400	5510400	What's that?
5510400	5511400	Face off.
5511400	5512400	Just recently.
5512400	5514400	And I don't want to turn this into my personal jukebox.
5514400	5516400	I've actually never seen Roadhouse.
5516400	5518400	I guess that's one thing I like about it.
5518400	5519400	I don't know if it's true,
5519400	5521400	but I think more people get defenestrated,
5521400	5524400	get thrown out of a window in that movie than any other movie.
5524400	5527400	Let's go with Roadhouse so that people aren't yelling out.
5527400	5528400	Roadhouse it is.
5528400	5529400	Let's all watch Roadhouse.
5529400	5531400	I mean, I'm sure most of you have seen it.
5531400	5532400	I've never seen it.
5532400	5533400	Let's watch Roadhouse.
5533400	5535400	If you want to come dressed up as Sam Elliott
5535400	5537400	or some character from it, if you want to come out,
5537400	5539400	maybe we can do a little line reading.
5539400	5541400	Maybe a little vignette from it or something like that.
5541400	5544400	So between now and then, listen to Roadhouse.
5544400	5545400	Watch Roadhouse.
5545400	5547400	Maybe you can write alternate scenes.
5547400	5551400	Sometimes your law and order is like alternate endings or something.
5551400	5553400	Let's find out what happens when we just watch the movie
5553400	5556400	and then next week we'll go like,
5556400	5559400	okay, now that we did that, maybe we'll add little activities.
5559400	5562400	Remember, there was this thing when I was a kid.
5562400	5564400	Was it Bill Cosby had this magic pen?
5564400	5565400	What the fuck was that?
5565400	5566400	Picture pages.
5566400	5567400	Picture pages.
5567400	5568400	It was weird.
5568400	5569400	It was a lot of interactivity to it.
5569400	5570400	It was pre-internet.
5570400	5572400	It was very addictive.
5572400	5575400	You could get the thing and then he was doing it with you.
5575400	5578400	It was good shit.
5578400	5581400	Bill Cosby, if you're listening, why'd you stop?
5581400	5584400	Would a better work come along?
5584400	5587400	You fucked the people over, Bill Cosby.
5587400	5589400	He still gigs all the time, doesn't he?
5589400	5595400	Yeah, but I bet he doesn't know why his life's empty.
5595400	5599400	Everybody comes backstage and goes, where did I go wrong?
5599400	5600400	Picture pages.
5600400	5601400	You should have stuck with it.
5601400	5604400	That's his rosebud.
5604400	5605400	Do you think you're going to retire?
5605400	5607400	Do you just stop writing one day?
5607400	5608400	Yes.
5608400	5609400	Really?
5609400	5610400	Yeah.
5610400	5611400	Soon as possible.
5611400	5613400	You know, I hate writing.
5613400	5614400	I hate it.
5614400	5615400	No good can come of it.
5615400	5617400	No good can come of me writing.
5617400	5619400	I hate it.
5619400	5621400	But you like having written something.
5621400	5622400	You love when it's done, right?
5622400	5623400	Yes.
5623400	5624400	You like having written something.
5624400	5625400	Yes.
5625400	5626400	Yes.
5626400	5632400	You know, in order to have written something, you have to write it.
5632400	5638400	Thank you, Lou Ferrigno.
5638400	5639400	Lou Ferrigno, why are you here?
5639400	5642400	I was just trying to tell you.
5642400	5645400	Also, he came out to no applause.
5645400	5646400	Lou Ferrigno, everybody.
5646400	5647400	Come on.
5647400	5653400	I'm not painted green.
5653400	5656400	You see him at Wondercon and stuff like that.
5656400	5657400	He'll just be sitting.
5657400	5660400	And there's no line.
5660400	5663400	I don't.
5663400	5666400	You make me feel like I'm sticking a knife in or anything like that.
5666400	5668400	I grew up on Lou Ferrigno.
5668400	5669400	I'm just painting a picture for you.
5669400	5671400	I saw him at a commercial audition years ago, and it kind of bumped me out.
5671400	5674400	And I asked the casting director, I'm like, Lou Ferrigno's out there.
5674400	5675400	What are you doing?
5675400	5678400	And they're like, well, we're casting vampire diaries.
5678400	5679400	It was some commercial.
5679400	5681400	It was for Toyota or something like that.
5681400	5683400	And it wasn't for a giant hulk of a guy.
5683400	5684400	It was just a guy.
5684400	5687400	And he was there sitting on the bench like everybody else.
5687400	5689400	And I asked somebody, why would he do that?
5689400	5691400	They go, insurance.
5691400	5692400	You get a gig once a year.
5692400	5693400	You pay for your insurance.
5693400	5694400	You probably got money.
5694400	5696400	But you want that insurance.
5696400	5699400	So once in a while, you come out of your hole and you do a Toyota commercial.
5699400	5701400	You pay for your insurance.
5701400	5703400	Right, but he didn't get it.
5703400	5704400	Right, no.
5704400	5706400	Yeah, and he's not going to.
5706400	5708400	Before insurance or just a paycheck.
5708400	5710400	Yeah, you still have to go out there and go fishing.
5710400	5713400	You got to play ball and try to get a commercial.
5713400	5714400	It was depressing.
5714400	5718400	Do you know that our friend, Sam Simon, have you heard that he might be sick?
5718400	5719400	Yeah, I don't know.
5719400	5720400	We talk about that here.
5720400	5721400	Yeah.
5721400	5722400	Well, they're talking about it on Howard Stern.
5722400	5723400	That's the other reason.
5723400	5724400	Oh, yeah, he's very sick.
5724400	5725400	Yeah, yeah.
5725400	5726400	That's really it.
5726400	5727400	I don't know the details of it.
5727400	5729400	I feel like the world's falling apart.
5729400	5731400	Getting old, baby.
5731400	5732400	All right.
5732400	5733400	I've got to know.
5733400	5735400	I like committing to the dark crevice.
5735400	5736400	You see a crack.
5736400	5737400	You go through the crack.
5737400	5738400	Is there another crack?
5738400	5740400	The show started off on such a summit.
5740400	5746400	I don't think that that's God suggesting just fucking dive, dive, dive.
5746400	5747400	Like, what are you supposed to do?
5747400	5748400	Go, oh, yeah.
5748400	5752400	Like, Robin Williams is like, you know, that energy he brings out.
5752400	5754400	He's just going like, hey, Sparky.
5754400	5757400	And then you just laugh because you feel like you, you know, it's like, holy shit,
5757400	5758400	Jesus Christ.
5758400	5762400	Where could we go but into a deep, dark chasm?
5762400	5764400	What could be more valuable?
5764400	5768400	We should actually go deeper and darker than we've ever gone.
5768400	5771400	We've wrapped lots.
5771400	5774400	Where is the level?
5774400	5776400	What's the core of the earth?
5776400	5780400	What's below the magma?
5780400	5782400	What's the sub-aluminum?
5782400	5785400	What's the wine skin and the pee?
5785400	5789400	Like shitting on yourself in the fetal position.
5789400	5791400	Just me actually doing that?
5791400	5793400	Yeah, yeah.
5793400	5798400	That's all there is left.
5798400	5800400	It's the only thing that we haven't done yet.
5800400	5803400	That's the darkest thing.
5803400	5804400	I don't even know.
5804400	5805400	I don't know if that's true.
5805400	5806400	That's not true.
5806400	5807400	I don't know.
5807400	5808400	We did a show.
5808400	5812400	Dan and Rob Strav and Chris Tomlin and I did an improv show like four times called
5812400	5813400	The Gooth Balls.
5813400	5815400	And there was no structure, no suggestions.
5815400	5818400	We just went on stage and did whatever.
5818400	5824400	And one show ended with you naked, me seated next to you singing you a lullaby,
5824400	5828400	and your nose began to bleed like crazy.
5828400	5831400	Yeah, and I rubbed the blood all over my face.
5831400	5835400	The more you wiped it, the more you just completely covered yourself in bright,
5835400	5837400	beautifully crimson, gross...
5837400	5841400	The color of the lighting made it the reddest blood I've ever seen.
5841400	5844400	And you were there holding your balls and your dick in one hand
5844400	5847400	and smearing blood all over your hairy chest.
5847400	5850400	And the audience was just like, fucking...
5850400	5853400	I want my money back.
5853400	5857400	I came here to watch Changing Emotions.
5857400	5862400	I thought a guy was going to have another guy's arms doing a cooking show.
5862400	5863400	I just sang you a little lullaby.
5863400	5864400	There was no jokes on it.
5864400	5869400	And the lighting guy, just God bless him, just like, fade the black.
5869400	5871400	And Rob and Chris were in the back going,
5871400	5874400	Ah! Oh! Oh, no!
5874400	5876400	I remember Jack Black was on the audition.
5876400	5877400	Jack Black?
5877400	5880400	Because we were like, hey, you should come to our improv show.
5880400	5883400	We barely knew him.
5883400	5886400	Jack comes backstage, everybody's clothes on him.
5886400	5887400	We're all looking at him.
5887400	5890400	I love the fucking disorder of that.
5890400	5892400	And we were like, was that good? Was that bad?
5892400	5893400	And Rob was a girlfriend.
5893400	5895400	He was trying to fuck in the audience, and that was bad.
5895400	5897400	And Jack Black was back.
5897400	5898400	He goes, wow.
5898400	5900400	That was a fucking fiasco.
5901400	5903400	But he loved it.
5903400	5907400	Yeah, so there is a bottom below here.
5907400	5910400	You guys, you don't even know.
5910400	5912400	That was the greatest.
5912400	5914400	It's 950.
5914400	5922400	Is there anybody coming in here with pain or pleasure that makes them feel like somebody's hands shot up?
5922400	5924400	Do you want to come up?
5924400	5925400	Yeah.
5925400	5927400	Okay, all right.
5927400	5928400	All right.
5929400	5931400	A hand shot up.
5931400	5935400	It's very interesting to me that you can just say that in someone's hand will shoot up.
5935400	5938400	And we haven't been punished for it yet.
5938400	5939400	This one on?
5939400	5940400	What's your name?
5940400	5941400	Fedora.
5941400	5942400	Fedora, of course.
5942400	5943400	You guys know me.
5943400	5944400	I'm here all the time.
5944400	5948400	I just wanted to come up because I wasn't here last week.
5948400	5949400	I was at my friend Luciana's show.
5949400	5951400	It was really great.
5951400	5954400	But last week you had a lady guest.
5954400	5955400	Genevieve Pearson.
5955400	5956400	Yeah.
5956400	5961400	And a couple weeks ago I remember I came up to you and I said, it would be really cool if you could have some female guests sometime soon.
5961400	5962400	Right.
5962400	5964400	And I don't know if you remember that happening.
5964400	5966400	But I, okay.
5966400	5970400	You came up to go, did I do that?
5970400	5972400	No.
5972400	5973400	I'm sorry.
5973400	5974400	No, but that's great.
5974400	5976400	Anyway, I was really glad that you did that.
5976400	5977400	I was very proud of you.
5977400	5979400	Maybe subconsciously you took my hand.
5979400	5980400	Yeah, I'm sure.
5980400	5982400	Everything I do is subconscious, yes.
5982400	5983400	Anyway.
5983400	5985400	So there's a fun note for you to end on.
5985400	5988400	I feel like you crossed a threshold there and I'm proud of you.
5988400	5989400	Oh, yeah.
5989400	5991400	Well, I mean, what about, well, Erin's always up here.
5991400	5993400	Erin's always up here and she's really cool.
5993400	5994400	I love you.
5994400	5995400	You're my favorite part of the show.
5995400	5998400	Do you feel like, like, like, like, like...
5998400	6001400	You have a lot so hard at that.
6001400	6004400	The next thing that she said.
6004400	6009400	Like, women, women, women on stage, women, women performing.
6009400	6010400	What's up with that?
6010400	6012400	No.
6012400	6015400	Where's that going?
6015400	6016400	Do you think that...
6016400	6020400	I'm trying to figure out a way to phrase this without loading it
6020400	6023400	because it's easy to be, like, politically correct
6023400	6028400	and we can talk about how unfair the performance world is to women,
6028400	6030400	and I'm not saying that it's not,
6030400	6033400	but I want to figure out a way to actually intelligently, like,
6033400	6037400	vivisect that and look at the beating heart of whatever's happening.
6037400	6039400	Erin and I were talking about this.
6039400	6043400	Women, like, without even knowing that we're doing it,
6043400	6050400	like, women, unlike men, who just, I think at the root of it,
6050400	6052400	I'm going to try to talk this through.
6052400	6056400	I'm going to sound like a fucking crazy person.
6056400	6060400	Men are just like these, like, doesn't matter if we're handsome,
6060400	6063400	doesn't matter if we're ugly, doesn't matter what we are,
6063400	6066400	doesn't matter what role we occupy, doesn't matter if we have a bad back,
6066400	6069400	doesn't matter if one of our legs doesn't work, doesn't matter...
6069400	6076400	Like, our role in the world is to kind of want and, like, shoot out torpedoes
6076400	6079400	and kind of, like, try and either fail or succeed.
6079400	6082400	And I think that, like, women on stage,
6082400	6085400	like, when women are performing in anything,
6085400	6088400	no matter how enlightened the venue, no matter what the case,
6088400	6091400	like, Erin and I were trying to get to the bottom of this.
6091400	6094400	It's like, there's a fucking tightrope you have to walk as a woman
6094400	6098400	because the most progressive PC,
6098400	6102400	like, super modern, metrosexual, futuristic,
6102400	6106400	Blade Runner thinker is still, before he's even thinking of it,
6106400	6111400	he's thinking of a woman as a woman and kind of, like, there's...
6111400	6114400	Like, the way Erin put it was something like,
6114400	6117400	if you're this, they're disappointed in you.
6117400	6120400	If you're that, they're disappointed in you.
6120400	6123400	Like, the only way to describe it is a tightrope.
6123400	6126400	It's just, I don't know what it's a tightrope between, really,
6126400	6129400	but it's, like, you're doing some kind of balancing act all the time.
6129400	6132400	I feel like you addressed that with Genevieve last week
6132400	6135400	when you were talking about her reception on the reality show she was on,
6135400	6137400	about something Kevin Smith said to her about,
6137400	6139400	oh, you're a girl and you like comic books.
6139400	6141400	I mean, that was insane to me.
6141400	6143400	That was, I mean, I'm really, like,
6144400	6147400	I don't want to, like, give myself some kind of Al and all to, like, metal.
6147400	6149400	Like, I...
6149400	6152400	My thing is always, like, I...
6152400	6154400	Just the same way with alcoholism or racism,
6154400	6156400	I want to cut everyone off with a pass and go,
6156400	6158400	fuck, no, I'm a misogynist, I'm a sexist.
6158400	6159400	Here's why.
6159400	6161400	Because I don't want to have that conversation
6161400	6163400	where it's like, are you or aren't you all this bullshit?
6163400	6166400	And I think the thing that gets me in the most trouble is that I...
6166400	6169400	Like, why am I talking about myself with this?
6169400	6171400	Because I don't want to sound like I'm in a soapbox.
6171400	6173400	I don't want to, like, rush to judge.
6173400	6176400	But I thought in that moment, that was a very odd thing that happened,
6176400	6180400	where she actually got the better of this guy and this debate
6180400	6183400	and that in the edited context of this thing,
6183400	6185400	the first thing he said was,
6185400	6189400	got to give props to a chick who can correct a dude on Frank Miller.
6189400	6191400	It's like, holy shit, we're nerds,
6191400	6193400	we're down at the bottom of this valley
6193400	6197400	and there's still down here where Gollum lives.
6197400	6200400	There's male Gollums are still going like,
6200400	6202400	props to that pussy, man, that pussy was good.
6202400	6205400	You know, like, knowing which fish to eat raw.
6205400	6207400	Like, it was like, what?
6207400	6210400	We're all Gollum down here.
6210400	6212400	The whole point was...
6212400	6214400	That was really, really weird to me.
6214400	6216400	I'm going to edit this all out,
6216400	6218400	because I sound like a fucking douchebag in some weird way.
6218400	6219400	You don't sound like a douchebag.
6219400	6220400	And one wasn't fishing for that either.
6220400	6221400	Everyone shut up.
6221400	6223400	Okay.
6224400	6227400	Yeah, I pontificate all the time about race
6227400	6231400	and it's much easier to obsess about race than it is about gender.
6231400	6232400	For me, anyway.
6232400	6235400	I think because of the relationship that I have with my mom.
6235400	6239400	Because women are...
6239400	6241400	Sometimes you want to have sex with them,
6241400	6243400	sometimes you don't.
6243400	6246400	In between, there's eight million fifty things.
6246400	6249400	There are women that...
6249400	6252400	You can objectify them without knowing that you're objectifying them.
6252400	6255400	And then even if you get through that hurdle,
6255400	6260400	then everyone else's weird objectifications of women come into play.
6260400	6263400	So if you were a guy and you respected a woman that you worked with,
6263400	6265400	and you were like, oh, she's really funny, I really like her,
6265400	6266400	I want her to be my friend.
6266400	6270400	It's like, then on the other side of that, there's all this like, it's crazy.
6270400	6274400	Is that a problem that we solve or do we accept that that's the case?
6274400	6277400	I think it's something that we always keep in mind
6277400	6280400	and strive to understand and hopefully change sometime.
6281400	6284400	Well, I think you're on your period.
6284400	6286400	Otherwise, you wouldn't say that.
6286400	6288400	Am I right, fellas?
6288400	6289400	Get her out of here.
6289400	6291400	Let's open the dick shoot.
6291400	6295400	Let's not go and watch Road House.
6295400	6298400	That's a dick shoot.
6298400	6300400	Yeah, I don't know.
6300400	6302400	I don't know where...
6302400	6304400	It's a weird epiphany to have at 40,
6304400	6307400	where it's like, I'm not going to be able to do anything about it anyway.
6307400	6309400	That's not true, because you had a lady on the show
6309400	6311400	and you talked about how, as a lady nerd,
6311400	6313400	she got talked down to by Kevin Smith,
6313400	6316400	who I would love to be able to admire and respect as an artist,
6316400	6318400	but then he says shit like that.
6318400	6321400	I mean, off the cuff, though, and he doesn't even know he's saying it.
6321400	6322400	I know.
6322400	6325400	That's the... I don't know.
6325400	6328400	I'm just offended by that shirt he always wears.
6328400	6329400	Oh, I know, right?
6329400	6330400	I'm sure he sells those.
6330400	6332400	Those are custom-designed.
6332400	6333400	Such a cut.
6334400	6336400	He is.
6339400	6341400	See, that's tearing down the wall.
6341400	6344400	Let's bring him out. Kevin Smith, everybody.
6344400	6346400	I mean, he should come out.
6346400	6347400	Like, if he did come out, we'd be like,
6347400	6349400	hey, well, bro down with the showdown.
6349400	6350400	Like, whatever.
6350400	6351400	Like, we're not going to be like,
6351400	6354400	oh, we brought you out here to take you to task.
6354400	6356400	Let's not bring him out. How about that?
6356400	6357400	Let's not have him out.
6357400	6361400	I even feel like that would be a conversation he'd be willing to have
6361400	6364400	about, like, oh, yeah, so I didn't really...
6364400	6366400	He'd continue this conversation with us
6366400	6369400	rather than just try to defend himself.
6369400	6370400	I don't even know.
6370400	6371400	Speaking as someone who's been on Twitter
6371400	6373400	and had people tweet at me and going,
6373400	6377400	like, no, point of honor, episode three,
6377400	6379400	season two, and so-and-so made this joke.
6379400	6382400	It's like, you can't help but...
6382400	6385400	The definition of your humanity,
6385400	6388400	you have a certain amount of servo-mounted guns out there.
6388400	6390400	Otherwise, who are you?
6390400	6392400	If everything that comes your way is like,
6392400	6394400	oh, yeah, let's see your side of it immediately,
6394400	6397400	like, you can't help but go, like, okay, first of all,
6397400	6400400	why is this person full of shit?
6400400	6403400	I mean, I'm just speaking to that hypothetically.
6403400	6405400	Like, let's have Kevin Smith on and talk about gender
6405400	6407400	and about that one comment he made on that reality show.
6407400	6410400	Well, I'm not suggesting that's something you should actually do.
6410400	6413400	What I was saying was that I know he's not that guy all the time,
6413400	6414400	like, at his core.
6414400	6415400	I know he's not a misogynist.
6415400	6418400	I would go so far as to say, I don't think anyone is that guy.
6418400	6422400	I think that any of us, from any perspective at any given time,
6422400	6426400	we get accidentally, like, if you could actually sit anybody down
6426400	6428400	and, like, walk through everything,
6428400	6433400	if we had that chance to do that with Hitler before he got turned loose,
6433400	6436400	like, okay, where are you going dressed like that?
6438400	6440400	I'm gonna go do some stuff, okay?
6440400	6442400	What do you mean?
6442400	6445400	I'm gonna kill six million Jews, all right?
6445400	6448400	Because you don't want to watch Game of Thrones, so what the fuck?
6449400	6451400	Hitler, get over here.
6451400	6452400	Sit down.
6452400	6454400	Why are you gonna kill six million Jews?
6454400	6455400	You know why?
6455400	6456400	No, I don't.
6456400	6460400	Like, talk for 45 minutes and not from a balcony.
6460400	6461400	Talk to me.
6461400	6463400	I'm your dad.
6463400	6464400	This is fucking...
6464400	6465400	You don't care about my art.
6465400	6466400	You don't care.
6466400	6467400	Fucking...
6468400	6471400	I said, like, what if my mustache was just in the middle
6471400	6473400	and you're like, fuck you?
6474400	6476400	Like, so maybe fuck you.
6476400	6477400	Fuck everybody.
6477400	6480400	Okay, you can have a little mustache.
6480400	6483400	I'm not gonna lie, I've slightly lost the threat of this.
6486400	6487400	Yeah, you may be right.
6488400	6489400	I don't know.
6490400	6491400	That's all I had to say.
6491400	6494400	I wanted to say I'm glad that you had a lady on the show,
6494400	6495400	and that made me happy.
6495400	6496400	Oh, she was swell, you know?
6496400	6497400	And it was...
6497400	6500400	Aaron found that show, and Aaron identified with Genevieve,
6500400	6502400	and then Aaron tweeted Genevieve.
6502400	6504400	I mean, that was all Aaron.
6505400	6510400	And Aaron comes up here and takes a punch to the ovaries every week
6510400	6512400	and walks that tightrope for all women.
6512400	6513400	Which, good for her.
6513400	6514400	You go.
6514400	6516400	Good for you coming up here with these men.
6517400	6519400	And she has her own podcast called This Feels Terrible
6519400	6520400	where she talks about relationships,
6520400	6526400	and I live with her, so I know that she'll get an email
6526400	6527400	from somebody going like,
6528400	6531400	regarding your interview with so-and-so,
6531400	6534400	and it's like, I think you did a huge disservice to blah-blah-blah
6534400	6536400	when you said blah-blah-blah,
6536400	6539400	and she'll get all wound up about it the same way I would.
6539400	6542400	And it's like, half the people are calling you liberated
6542400	6543400	for saying something,
6543400	6545400	and then the other half of the people are going like,
6545400	6547400	you just fucking Uncle Tom'd all women.
6548400	6550400	It's pretty complicated.
6550400	6553400	And thank God, thank God for my little wiener.
6554400	6555400	Love it.
6555400	6556400	Well, thanks for letting me come up and say hi.
6556400	6557400	Fedora, everybody.
6557400	6558400	Thank you.
6559400	6560400	All right.
6561400	6562400	Well.
6564400	6565400	What do you think, Dan?
6565400	6566400	What a show, Jeff.
6566400	6567400	We did it, man.
6567400	6568400	That was fun.
6568400	6569400	You brought through everything.
6569400	6571400	I didn't even know Robin was going to be here tonight.
6571400	6572400	That was awesome.
6572400	6573400	Yeah. It was interesting.
6573400	6575400	I let a little tinge in the back of my head.
6575400	6577400	I'm like, come on, how many times have I made fun of that guy?
6577400	6578400	Huh?
6578400	6580400	Like, you know, he's a mainstream success,
6580400	6581400	and I was like...
6581400	6582400	Yeah.
6582400	6583400	It was kind of like...
6583400	6584400	He's such a lovely guy.
6584400	6587400	I got to have dinner with him, and he was just so delightful,
6587400	6590400	and he looks great, and he's just so funny.
6590400	6593400	Like, he's not, like, in a gross, like, shut up.
6593400	6595400	Like, you need to stop doing bits right now.
6595400	6596400	Like, it was just really...
6596400	6597400	I mean, it's part of who he is.
6597400	6598400	Everything is a bit.
6598400	6601400	Everything is a joke, but, like, he's actually really good at it,
6601400	6605400	and it's actually for the benefit to the people around him.
6605400	6606400	And his book is coming out.
6606400	6608400	It's called Fuck It.
6611400	6612400	All right.
6612400	6613400	Yeah.
6613400	6614400	So, Roadhouse?
6614400	6615400	Oh, yeah.
6615400	6618400	Everybody watch Roadhouse, and we'll meet next week.
6619400	6620400	All right.
6620400	6621400	Jeff, what do we do?
6622400	6623400	I'm not doing shit.
6624400	6625400	To end the show.
6625400	6626400	You fucking suffer out there.
6626400	6627400	No, I'm kidding.
6627400	6628400	Of course.
6628400	6629400	April Fools?
6630400	6631400	You want to do some enigma?
6631400	6633400	You want to maybe, like, get to the bottom of it,
6633400	6636400	kind of in a cosmic sense?
6637400	6638400	Rap about gender roles.
6638400	6639400	No worries.
6639400	6640400	No worries.
6640400	6641400	No worries.
6641400	6642400	All right.
6642400	6643400	Hook up the...
6643400	6644400	Fire up the enigma.
6644400	6645400	All right.
6646400	6648400	Bring the lights down.
6651400	6653400	Everyone close your eyes.
6659400	6661400	Thank you for being part of this planet.
6665400	6667400	Now release.
6668400	6669400	You're floating.
6671400	6672400	Devotion.
6675400	6676400	Devotion.
6680400	6681400	Forgiveness.
6686400	6687400	Emotion.
6690400	6692400	You will no longer crave cigarettes.
6696400	6699400	When someone asks you if you need more bread,
6699400	6700400	he'll say no.
6700400	6701400	No.
6704400	6706400	You're going to write in that dream journal?
6707400	6708400	No.
6708400	6709400	Fuck that.
6709400	6711400	That's the stratosphere.
6711400	6713400	Now you're moving further out from Earth.
6719400	6721400	Watch that planet go away.
6721400	6723400	Fuck that planet.
6723400	6726400	Fuck that little blue-green piece of shit.
6726400	6728400	Look at that little fucker.
6728400	6730400	It's getting smaller.
6730400	6732400	It's the size of a marble now.
6732400	6734400	It's a little piece of shit.
6735400	6737400	All the little people on there.
6737400	6739400	All the little problems.
6740400	6742400	They're little pieces of shit.
6742400	6743400	Little assholes.
6743400	6745400	Little fuck faces.
6745400	6747400	Little cock fuckers.
6747400	6749400	Little fuck fucks.
6749400	6750400	Little pieces of shit.
6750400	6751400	Oh shit.
6751400	6752400	Fuck.
6752400	6753400	God damn it.
6753400	6754400	We hit Saturn.
6754400	6756400	Everybody stay cool.
6756400	6758400	Nobody leave the cabin.
6759400	6760400	I'm going to go out and look.
6760400	6762400	Hold on.
6762400	6765400	Everybody, there's bags in the upper...
6765400	6767400	Everyone, reach up.
6767400	6769400	There's bags.
6769400	6770400	Breathe through the bags.
6770400	6772400	I'll be right back.
6772400	6775400	My name's Kyle Johnson.
6775400	6776400	I'm your pilot.
6776400	6778400	I'll be right back.
6783400	6785400	Three hours later...
6787400	6789400	It's me, Kyle.
6789400	6791400	Open the door.
6791400	6792400	Hey, come on, man.
6792400	6794400	Open the door.
6794400	6796400	It's me, Kyle Johnson.
6796400	6798400	I swear to God, it's me.
6798400	6800400	What the fuck are you doing?
6800400	6802400	What are you doing?
6802400	6804400	Hey, it's me, Dan Harmon.
6804400	6806400	I never left the cabin.
6807400	6809400	He said don't open the door.
6809400	6811400	I say we don't open it.
6813400	6814400	I'm fucking dying out here.
6814400	6815400	I'm dying out here.
6815400	6818400	I'm fucking saying there's octopus creatures out here.
6818400	6819400	I don't know, man.
6819400	6821400	I think it's a test.
6823400	6826400	I'm Leroy Smith.
6828400	6830400	I'm a Native American.
6831400	6833400	And I didn't come up here in space
6833400	6836400	to be fucked around by a bunch of honkies.
6836400	6838400	Sucker.
6838400	6839400	Hey, man.
6839400	6841400	Sit the fuck down, okay?
6841400	6843400	This guy is the pilot and he said,
6843400	6844400	open the fucking door.
6844400	6845400	I can't breathe.
6845400	6848400	I'm going to get killed by octopus monsters.
6849400	6852400	I want to do something I should have done a long time ago.
6852400	6856400	Leroy, I'm going to open up this door, sucker.
6858400	6859400	Oh, God damn it.
6859400	6860400	Thank you.
6860400	6861400	Thank you.
6862400	6864400	Jesus Christ, it's crazy out there.
6864400	6866400	There's a bunch of octopus monsters.
6866400	6867400	Yeah, yeah.
6867400	6868400	What did they do?
6868400	6870400	They did this.
6874400	6875400	You're all dead.
6876400	6877400	You all failed.
6879400	6880400	Nope.
6880400	6881400	No.
6882400	6883400	Don't applaud.
6884400	6886400	Your spirits are leaving Saturn.
6888400	6890400	Now you see Pluto.
6891400	6892400	Is it a planet?
6893400	6894400	You can't remember.
6894400	6896400	Five seconds left.
6896400	6898400	It was in 1995.
6899400	6901400	Now it's an icy cloud.
6904400	6906400	That was the next song.
6907400	6908400	All right.
6908400	6909400	Should we continue?
6909400	6910400	All right, everybody.
6910400	6911400	Thank you for coming to Harman Town.
6912400	6914400	I love it when the plan comes together.
6915400	6918400	Let's thank Robin Williams and Bobcat Goldthwaite again, can we?
6921400	6925400	Of course, Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, and Fedor for coming up.
6926400	6927400	I'm Jeff Davis.
6927400	6928400	One more time.
6928400	6929400	Dan Harman, everybody.
6929400	6931400	We love you deeply and dearly.
6931400	6936400	All right, watch Roadhouse and take notes, and we'll see you next week.
