0	9000	Hello, hello, hello! From Meltdown Conference in Hollywood, California, Harbin Town is now
9000	20000	in session. Please welcome the stage mayor of Harbin Town,
20000	22000	Harbin!
22000	24000	Harbin!
24000	26000	Harbin!
26000	28000	Harbin!
28000	30000	Harbin!
30000	32000	Harbin!
32000	34000	Harbin!
34000	36000	Harbin!
36000	38000	Harbin!
38000	40000	Thank you.
40000	44000	I've been kind of haunted by when Dino was on the show and he kind of watched the show through his eyes
44000	48000	and at one point he's like, Why are these people here? Why do they come here?
48000	50000	It was a valid question.
50000	52000	So now I'm kind of like,
52000	54000	I'm back to my old nervous self.
54000	56000	I want to put on a good show.
56000	58000	So that's probably a good energy to be in, right?
58000	60000	That's good. Always be prepared to give people what they want.
60000	62000	Yeah.
62000	64000	It was just not to say that I don't have anything to talk about.
64000	66000	So we adopted a...
66000	68000	Aaron and I adopted a new dog.
68000	70000	Like...
70000	72000	Yeah.
72000	76000	Our therapist then told us we had adopted a grief dog.
77000	81000	Because we had adopted it moments after our friend OD.
81000	85000	And I didn't do the math until that moment.
85000	87000	I was like, I guess we have a grief dog.
87000	89000	I guess this wasn't a responsible decision.
89000	92000	But we got this little tiny dog
92000	98000	through some rescue service from some guy that found it in a box on the street or whatever.
98000	105000	And it's like this little mix of terrier and a bunch of other things that make it not breathe properly
105000	107000	but snore adorably.
107000	110000	It's smaller than my cat.
110000	113000	But it won't stop humping Harvey.
113000	115000	And it loves Harvey.
115000	117000	Harvey loves it.
117000	119000	They're very happy together.
119000	123000	Why are dogs humping things so funny to us?
123000	129000	As primates, we're the most awkward humpers, you would think, in the animal kingdom.
129000	131000	Other animals are kind of designed to do that.
132000	136000	But when you look at a little dog humping a big dog's elbow
136000	139000	and the expression on their face,
139000	144000	when they're looking at anything other than...
144000	150000	I think it's because we're kind of Heisenberg-ing that experiment.
150000	152000	They're looking at you generally.
152000	156000	You're in the room and they make weird eye contact with you while they're humping you.
156000	158000	And that's no fun for anybody.
158000	160000	He's a little guy.
160000	165000	Did you say we should go rescue a dog in your grief or did that dog come to you somehow?
165000	170000	No, I feel like I a long time ago was like Harvey should have a companion
170000	173000	because I think that he's a livable guy and we get a lot out of him.
173000	178000	But I also feel like every time he encounters another dog, he's so happy.
178000	182000	It's just the thought of when we left the house,
182000	184000	if there was another dog there that you could hang out with.
184000	186000	It was just very cartoonish thinking.
186000	189000	And then there was also that karmic thinking of we got Harvey from a breeder.
189000	194000	He's our little buttermilk, silver spoon, little biological child
194000	199000	that we bred with our little white penis parts.
199000	208000	And I was always like, we got to go get ourselves a fucking, you know, a little scrapper
208000	211000	to make up for it in God's eyes.
211000	213000	It's a grief and a guilt dog at the same time.
213000	216000	Yeah, it's a guilt dog on behalf of the animal lovers of the world,
216000	220000	like the people that would otherwise say you killed a dog when you brought Harvey home.
220000	222000	So is anybody currently at home with those dogs right now?
222000	225000	Or is it just a giant dog fuckfest going on?
225000	232000	Well, we're crate training Nigel, which is the name of our little Nigel.
232000	235000	We're crate training him.
235000	238000	Is there an origin story for the name of Nigel?
238000	241000	No, I just, we were trying to, we were going to go with Willem
241000	245000	because he looks like Willem Dafoe, but she, I don't know.
245000	249000	I just, we were getting in the car and then I just instinctively kind of called him Nigel
249000	254000	as I was like, come here, Nigel, and whatever.
254000	255000	It's become a morning show.
255000	258000	Our show's a morning show now.
258000	259000	Soon we'll have equipment.
259000	260000	I'll bring up photos.
260000	261000	I'll show you my dog photos.
261000	264000	And then maybe I'll have a baby by then and I'll bring up them.
264000	266000	I'm not saying no one's pregnant.
266000	274000	Also, later on in tonight's show, Dan's going to make his famous New England clam chowder.
274000	277000	Mr. Nibbles is coming out.
277000	279000	I'm very excited about our guest.
279000	283000	I was talking to him in the green room and he just turned into the show.
283000	287000	I skipped through the green room because I was a little bit late and didn't have time,
287000	290000	but just managed to see our guest and I'm very excited.
290000	292000	I always have a rule.
292000	294000	I try not to talk to the guest.
294000	296000	I just stare at them and fold my arms.
296000	300000	No, I just, I don't try to, if they're coming in, because I'm a bad interviewer and a bad,
300000	303000	so I want whatever energy I have, whatever I want to talk to them about,
303000	307000	I don't want to have to, but I just started talking to them about all this stuff,
307000	310000	so no show tonight and it's bad.
310000	313000	If you see us talking about anything interesting, it's the second time through.
313000	315000	All the answers are prepared.
315000	322000	But my enthusiasm for this guy is like many, many, many layers.
322000	324000	But I think we should just bring them out right away.
324000	326000	I don't think I have anything to talk about.
326000	327000	I'm miserable at work.
327000	329000	I'm trying very hard to make season six good.
329000	331000	Why don't we talk about that for a little moment?
331000	336000	Why don't you unburden yourself of that just to get things, like, let's...
336000	337000	I'm just very behind schedule.
337000	338000	It's all my fault.
338000	342000	I just, from a very get-go, you know, they finally gave me enough rope to hang myself.
342000	344000	I don't have anybody to complain about.
344000	347000	I have this giant corporation in Yahoo that just loves the show.
347000	349000	They're going to advertise the fuck out of it.
349000	353000	Everything is, like, beautiful and wonderful.
353000	356000	Everyone's on my side and so, of course, I'm going to self-destruct.
357000	362000	Is it as simple as you don't have an enemy above you that you dislike and hate and fear?
362000	364000	I believe that's the case, yeah.
364000	367000	I think that I need to feel like I'm supposed to clean my room
367000	370000	so that me not cleaning my room is entertainment.
370000	373000	But now this is just going to be a show about a dirty room.
373000	376000	And it's not going to make any sense, you know?
376000	378000	Like, why don't you clean up your room?
378000	380000	I don't know.
380000	382000	No, it's not that bad.
382000	385000	I'm just worried about it all the time because I don't have anything to gauge it by.
385000	388000	But aren't you always this behind schedule and worried at the same time?
388000	390000	I think it's unprecedented this time.
390000	395000	I think just the first episode, I was like, I put us way behind schedule the first episode.
395000	397000	It wasn't like I knew how to do the first episode.
397000	401000	It was like I didn't and then, like, I just kept delaying that.
401000	405000	And then, like, so everything is just, everything is just delayed all the time.
405000	408000	Is it like Tootsie where people are getting pages, right?
408000	411000	It's exactly like Tootsie.
411000	418000	Before you finish your question, in any way that you could mean that, it's exactly like Tootsie.
418000	421000	I've never seen Tootsie. I don't know.
421000	423000	Tootsie's based on a soap opera, I think so.
423000	428000	And we do shoot community right now is being shot like a soap opera.
428000	432000	Yes, there are these actors who have these characters that they understand that come in
432000	436000	and they do not know what they're doing and they are handed pages for the next scene
436000	439000	and they look at them and they learn them during rehearsal.
439000	442000	And, I mean, they should all get Emmys relative to that.
442000	449000	So should the prop master who then goes, oh, so a giant phone then? Asshole!
449000	452000	And I'm like, yeah, sorry, I just typed it.
452000	458000	And I was like, I'll start with the big phones and see how I can make them bigger.
458000	462000	And she goes in back and then she comes out with a giant phone an hour later
462000	466000	and everyone's great and they all hate me because if I gave them more time with material,
466000	469000	they would be able to do their jobs as good as they are.
469000	473000	The prop masters are unbelievable in their ability to you at the last second to rewrite something
473000	476000	and it just appear on set. It's unreal how they do that.
476000	479000	Yeah, and the people that make the pants and the people that make the hats,
479000	485000	two departments that you didn't know were different, constantly feuding with each other.
485000	488000	Within the wardrobe department, there's the pants department, the hat department,
488000	492000	and something, you know, pages will come in and I'll purposely antagonize them
492000	497000	by saying something like, he has a large trouser-shaped hat.
497000	503000	Just to watch, because I just like to watch him, watch him.
503000	505000	No, that's not true.
505000	510000	But everybody that works on that show should get a medal of honor
510000	517000	and I should be shot in the face and my blood should be like scraped into a vial
517000	523000	and sent to a lab so we can figure out a way to block my DNA from ever reoccurring in television
523000	528000	because all I do is hurt people.
528000	530000	Thank you.
530000	533000	It was the one time when I was fishing for something.
533000	535000	And it only kind of trickled in.
535000	541000	Yeah, it was very, they were like, here, if this is going to...
541000	543000	They were like, we agree, go on.
543000	548000	They were like, well, if you're not going to go on, oh, all right, got it.
548000	550000	Okay, well, anyways, let's...
550000	553000	But yeah, so I just like, you know, I'm trying to...
553000	554000	So then if I...
554000	558000	So you got directors coming in because I had dinner with Bobcat the night before he...
558000	561000	for a table read and he knew that the next day there was no script.
561000	562000	I was just starting to cut his episodes.
562000	563000	Great.
563000	566000	Yeah, but he was saying like, so like, I've never really done this before.
566000	567000	The table reads tomorrow.
567000	568000	There's no script.
568000	570000	I said, there might not be a table.
570000	573000	You might walk into there building a table for you.
573000	576000	And he goes, for me, that's kind of how I make my movies.
576000	578000	Like, I don't like to know everything in advance.
578000	580000	He goes, this seems like perfect for me.
580000	581000	He did great.
581000	582000	I said, I think it will be then.
582000	583000	It's a great episode.
583000	584000	He did a great episode.
584000	585000	They're all great episodes.
585000	586000	It's a great show.
586000	587000	It's the best show on TV.
587000	588000	It's not even on TV.
588000	591000	I just have to go through this.
591000	593000	It's just, there's nobody telling me what to do.
593000	596000	So then you look at it and you're like, well, that's how you're going to end it?
596000	599000	With Leonard just taking a shit?
599000	600000	Oh, all right.
600000	602000	Soilers.
602000	604000	What would you rather have?
604000	607000	You haven't seen what he ate.
607000	610000	What would you rather have next time if you had to do another season or another show?
610000	613000	Would you rather have Robertson Meckis breathing down your neck
613000	617000	or a nice cable network not breathing down your neck?
617000	621000	No, I think I continue to enjoy TV.
621000	624000	I just think that, I think what I definitely need is like,
624000	627000	because Chris McKenna is like my right hand man
627000	631000	and the guy who makes everything really funny has a lot of passion.
631000	636000	It's not like I'm Picasso and he's like a guy that makes Picasso possible.
636000	637000	It's not like he's a frame fetcher.
637000	639000	I don't know who did what for Picasso.
639000	643000	But he's like an equal and a partner creatively.
643000	645000	He just cares about the show in different ways.
645000	649000	But he's very funny, funnier than me and always comes up with these ideas.
649000	652000	It's just he and I making the show together as partners.
652000	657000	And what there isn't is like a liaison between us and the suits and the production.
657000	661000	And what we need is like kind of a third guy that's just like,
661000	663000	hey, it's me, Eugene.
663000	666000	And I'm like, oh, Eugene.
666000	668000	He's like, you need help with that funny script?
668000	669000	They're like, sure, Eugene.
669000	671000	You're a hilarious writer.
671000	677000	But first, could you check in with the line producer about those giant phones?
677000	678000	That's what we need.
678000	680000	And also, oh, Sony's calling.
680000	682000	Hey, Eugene, you take that one.
682000	684000	Give your comedy a break for a second.
684000	686000	Go take the Sony call.
686000	688000	We need Eugene.
688000	691000	So what was that person's name on the last version?
691000	694000	Nice try.
694000	700000	Everyone takes a little bit of the Eugene role here and there.
700000	703000	So it's all too much paradise there?
703000	707000	Everyone's Picasso and there's nobody yelling at you and it's just too easy?
707000	712000	And coupled with the fact that any actual grown-up work that has to be done,
712000	714000	it's either me or Chris doing it, neither of us.
714000	716000	That's not our wheelhouse.
716000	718000	That's not where we're best used.
718000	723000	We don't want to talk on the phone to anybody about marketing or keeping the trains running.
723000	724000	But we have to.
724000	726000	We're happy to do so, but then we are behind schedule.
726000	728000	So that's my lesson.
728000	731000	I would like to do more TV, but I need to find a fall guy.
731000	734000	I need to find a guy that's like...
734000	739000	Like more of the type A person that likes the minutia, likes the detail work?
739000	742000	Yeah, like one of these guys that's kind of happy to not be funny or something.
742000	744000	I don't know.
744000	747000	That's sort of like, I just like being around the magic.
747000	750000	You guys are crazy.
750000	753000	What were you smoking?
753000	755000	Wait, what are you smoking?
755000	758000	What are you smoking?
758000	761000	If you call Human Resources, I'll fucking kill you.
761000	765000	Go back in your office, Eugene, and talk to Sony.
765000	768000	We just need somebody, somebody.
768000	773000	That seems like a dream job for a lot of people that aren't that talented but would love to be around them.
773000	776000	Yeah, I think there's a lot of those guys out there.
776000	779000	I think we have a few in the crowd. They just clapped.
779000	782000	I wouldn't mind being that guy pretty soon.
782000	786000	I'm kind of that guy on Rick and Morty a little bit, like Justin's so insane.
786000	791000	I just stay in the writer's room and work on scripts, but Justin's a maniac.
791000	798000	So I'm just kind of like, hey, you heard the man making about turds.
798000	800000	Anyways, actually that's not true at all.
800000	804000	Justin does everything related to production, so that's not even a good analogy at all.
804000	806000	I'm just kind of like the head writer on Rick and Morty.
806000	808000	Who cares?
808000	811000	We came to the show called Harmon Town. We care.
811000	813000	Shut up.
813000	817000	You should care more about our guests tonight.
817000	820000	Let's bring them up and start.
820000	823000	Oh, what is this?
823000	825000	Were you in the hospital recently?
825000	827000	Oh, God.
827000	829000	I was in the middle of this.
829000	831000	Oh, that's right. I'm dying.
831000	833000	What's happening?
833000	835000	When is this from?
835000	838000	Oh, this is from Harris' memorial.
838000	840000	Humblebrag.
840000	842000	Good job.
842000	844000	Sorry.
844000	846000	That's worth noting in the diary of our lives.
846000	850000	They had a really wonderful memorial at the Upright Citizens Brigade new space,
850000	853000	which on paper I just would have thought, I don't want to go to this,
853000	859000	but I knew Aaron would want to be there and I was like, I'm going to go.
859000	865000	Also, I should be there, but I wouldn't have gone, do you know what I mean?
865000	872000	But I'm glad I did because it really hit you with the importance of a memorial service.
872000	877000	It was just a flood of stories about a person that's gone now.
877000	879000	You're just laughing the whole time.
879000	881000	It was just like, what an amazing guy.
881000	885000	It really helped atone somehow.
885000	888000	I don't know. Just squeezed you out a little bit.
888000	891000	There's a lot of people walking around shell-shocked,
891000	896000	and then you listen to these stories, and it just works.
896000	898000	I don't get it.
898000	900000	I guess the Neanderthals invented it, the idea of a funeral.
900000	902000	So why are we questioning?
902000	904000	Why did I think it wasn't a good idea to go?
904000	908000	But it was nice, and I have a bracelet on from it.
908000	911000	Were you afraid that because it was a comedy thing that it might not be sincere?
911000	917000	I was afraid of social anxieties coming and being around people, first of all.
917000	920000	I don't understand death, and I'm afraid of it and coping with it.
920000	922000	I don't know how to talk to people under normal circumstances.
922000	923000	I don't know how to small talk.
923000	926000	There is no such thing as small talk at a memorial.
926000	931000	My usual path through conversation to avoid my avoidance of small talk
931000	934000	is to kind of talk about whatever's really going on.
934000	938000	Whatever's really going on is not a fucking safe area at a memorial
938000	939000	because you don't know.
939000	941000	If you're talking to a Parks and Rec guy,
941000	945000	you can't be presumptuous about how grief-stricken someone must be.
945000	949000	You're trying to calculate how hard did this person get hit
949000	951000	and how right do I have to say anything?
951000	953000	I don't want to think about stuff like that.
953000	956000	I have to think about stuff like that too much, just like normally.
956000	958000	The therapist said, don't think about that stuff.
958000	962000	Just speak in truths that cannot be, just bring some Kleenex,
962000	967000	be the Kleenex guy, and say, no matter how ridiculous it sounds
967000	971000	and no matter how repetitive it sounds, this is terrible.
971000	972000	Really? This is terrible?
972000	974000	You're supposed to say that at a function?
974000	976000	But I tried doing it.
976000	978000	It worked on Adam Scott.
979000	981000	That's when I really leaned into it.
981000	983000	I remember it was Adam Scott and I said, this is terrible.
983000	985000	And he's like, yeah, yeah, it is.
985000	987000	This is hair.
989000	991000	I felt like he did appreciate it.
991000	993000	And I was like, okay, this is awful.
993000	994000	This is terrible.
994000	997000	And Adam Scott was like, okay, you can stop now.
999000	1000000	But yeah, it was great.
1000000	1002000	It was a great celebration.
1002000	1003000	Did you get up to speak?
1003000	1004000	No, of course not.
1004000	1005000	No, no.
1006000	1007000	It was just there.
1008000	1009000	Aaron was close to him.
1009000	1010000	Rob was very close to him.
1010000	1013000	And I knew Harris.
1013000	1017000	I didn't realize how close my close friends were to him.
1017000	1018000	I just met him a handful of times.
1018000	1021000	But I didn't realize how tight he and Rob were
1021000	1023000	and other friends of mine.
1023000	1024000	Yeah.
1028000	1030000	I would know exaggeration.
1031000	1033000	If you named a person that we knew,
1034000	1037000	I would, without knowing, I would bet that they knew him.
1037000	1039000	He was just kind of everywhere.
1039000	1043000	I forgot that he sang at Rob's wedding with Sarah and Paul.
1043000	1044000	Yeah.
1046000	1049000	I thought your little, I guess if it was a eulogy
1049000	1050000	that you did last show, it was very...
1050000	1052000	Well, that was my anger phase.
1053000	1055000	Other people are bargaining.
1055000	1058000	That was me being angry at anti-drug people.
1058000	1060000	And now I'm getting towards acceptance,
1060000	1062000	which is the scariest thing in the world,
1062000	1064000	because you don't want somebody to be dead.
1065000	1069000	Now that we've warmed up the stage for Booger.
1072000	1075000	My affection for this guy is unparalleled.
1075000	1079000	And I've been so excited about having him on the show for so long.
1079000	1084000	Even if only it was because he had been such an indelible presence
1084000	1087000	in so many formative movies when we were growing up.
1087000	1090000	So many reasons that I'm out here in this city.
1090000	1093000	But also just now in the modern world,
1093000	1096000	he's also doing some work I admire because he's the...
1096000	1100000	He's executive producing one of the only kind of semi-honest reality shows
1100000	1104000	that's on TV that we can talk about a little bit.
1104000	1105000	So let's bring him out.
1105000	1107000	Curtis Armstrong is here.
1107000	1121000	Take any of this, wherever you're comfortable.
1128000	1129000	Hello.
1129000	1131000	Thanks for playing me in.
1131000	1134000	We had to brighten the mood after that last 10 minutes.
1134000	1137000	Yeah, I know. I was really getting sad back there.
1137000	1138000	You were supposed to listen.
1138000	1139000	No, it's okay.
1139000	1140000	Well, it's just...
1140000	1141000	Oh, my.
1141000	1143000	You didn't happen to know Harris Whittles, did you?
1143000	1146000	I did not. I never worked with him. I never met him even.
1146000	1149000	Yeah, it was a... Yeah, whatever.
1149000	1151000	Well, it's like...
1153000	1156000	Just stories from him in the writer's room being sat at a memorial.
1156000	1160000	That's when it hits home because it's like you're in an audience of workaholics.
1160000	1163000	So everyone spends 16 hours a day in a certain environment
1163000	1166000	and then you're hearing about this guy who kind of shot through that environment
1166000	1170000	and it just raises all these questions about what the fuck are we doing,
1170000	1175000	which was a common theme and I think Matt Besser, who went up early on,
1175000	1181000	who's a renowned curmudgeon, but he really...
1181000	1184000	It was the perfect eulogy for anybody,
1184000	1186000	let alone somebody that he...
1186000	1189000	You could have taken it and put it in any wake
1189000	1192000	and it would have been very inspiring,
1192000	1195000	but it was really apropos to this guy that passed,
1195000	1200000	but it was all about that concept of what was this thing that made them special
1200000	1203000	that we didn't notice when they were around and now that they're gone,
1203000	1207000	what, you know, just how could this person live within us and can we...
1207000	1210000	And it really... It was really taken with all these stories about him
1210000	1213000	because the constant theme was how little a shit he gave.
1213000	1219000	He gave zero fucks and maybe that hurt him in the end,
1219000	1222000	but it also clearly was like, what the fuck was I doing?
1222000	1228000	The entire time that he was around, why was I over here doing something different,
1228000	1232000	like playing this game of how am I driving with the audience
1232000	1237000	when this guy was suffering under the yoke of mainstream perceptions
1237000	1241000	and spent every job that he went to and kept getting promoted.
1241000	1245000	He's one of those superstars that would come to work and then show up late
1245000	1248000	and no one gave a fuck because if they fired him, their show would get unfunny.
1249000	1255000	And he just spent his career bursting at the seams, whatever seams were around him.
1255000	1259000	And I was that guy at one point, at some point,
1259000	1266000	and then I started tweeting and then I turned into a fucking weird half Mr. Rogers, half asshole,
1266000	1270000	like constantly, by the way, how are you? What's your name?
1273000	1275000	Sorry, Curtis, that's all the time we have. Curtis, I'm struggling.
1275000	1276000	Thank you.
1279000	1283000	Anyways, I want to start with King of the Nerds instead of start.
1283000	1289000	I think we'll get into your blessings upon my adolescence,
1289000	1294000	but you're currently, right now, TBS, Friday nights at nine?
1294000	1297000	Friday nights at nine, yeah, for the first time.
1297000	1301000	It's called King of the Nerds, whereas most reality shows are kind of like,
1301000	1305000	they're called like, you know, who wants to fuck the smiling Joe?
1306000	1312000	And it's all about, you know, it's a very, it's a templated reality show.
1312000	1314000	I mean, it looks and feels like a reality show.
1314000	1320000	Yeah, well, it does because we've got, I mean, you know, the people who actually know what they're doing,
1320000	1325000	you know, Robert Carradine and I, who were in Revenge of the Nerds,
1325000	1332000	we came up with the nerd show idea, but we needed people who actually had a clue because we didn't.
1332000	1336000	We've never done reality shows. We've never known people who've been in reality shows.
1336000	1343000	So when once this thing was actually going somewhere, we needed people who could actually run it.
1343000	1349000	And those are the people who are making those kinds of, you know,
1349000	1354000	the actual template of, you know, survivor type shows or whatever.
1354000	1362000	But we have certain things that we want to make sure they stick with,
1362000	1368000	which has to do with nerd culture and have it be a little different.
1368000	1373000	Well, for instance, the fact that every time somebody gets eliminated, like, there's, I mean, it's, it's,
1373000	1375000	it breaks everyone's heart.
1375000	1383000	And you always, like, when the person gets eliminated is when they are raised to the height of their individuality.
1383000	1386000	And you give a little kind of Springer's final thoughts about who they are.
1386000	1387000	Right, right.
1387000	1393000	You say, you know, Jackson, although you're, there is no cosplay in the great beyond.
1393000	1396000	You have, you have dressed as a hero this way.
1396000	1397000	Whatever.
1397000	1399000	You do that really well.
1399000	1404000	You give them a very personalized, and it's not, it's not just based on superficial stuff.
1404000	1407000	They always cut them because I write them too long.
1407000	1411000	I mean, I, because what we do, I write those because I want,
1411000	1415000	I can't give them a basic, well, thanks for playing.
1415000	1418000	You know, it just, I, it's not in me to do it.
1418000	1427000	They mean, it's strange, but they actually, I'm an executive producer of this show and a host of the show,
1427000	1431000	but I am a fan of nerds and I've always been a fan of nerds.
1431000	1441000	And so when I'm in a room like you've got there and I'm watching them for, you know, 15 hours a day,
1441000	1448000	and I become so enraptured with them and it's, when they leave, it really bothers me.
1448000	1454000	And that separation you're supposed to have as a host of a reality show, I'm not capable.
1454000	1456000	I cannot do that.
1456000	1458000	I just get too emotionally involved.
1458000	1461000	And I don't think you have to because you're kind of a den leader to these Cub Scouts,
1461000	1466000	which is somebody who does need to have a kind of cosmic detachment from them because you're...
1466000	1471000	It's kept very separate when we're shooting, but what's going on inside of me is different.
1471000	1476000	And then what happens, you know, when we're shooting, there's no funny business.
1476000	1479000	There's no talking. There's no, you know, they are the hosts.
1479000	1484000	You don't talk to the hosts just like any other show, but I'm dying inside.
1484000	1488000	Is there any room in your show for that to be revealed?
1488000	1492000	I think people take it for granted. I think they just assume that that's the case,
1492000	1495000	that you don't actually have relationships with them.
1495000	1499000	No, I'm saying, but is there room to include that your pathos, pathetic...
1499000	1501000	You can do those little...
1501000	1508000	I take that, I use the farewells, you know, which are usually made up on the spot
1508000	1512000	because we don't know completely who's going to go home and who's not.
1512000	1514000	So they're made up at the last minute.
1514000	1519000	And I use that as my way of expressing my love for them.
1519000	1521000	And then they cut that down to a tiny...
1521000	1523000	And they cut that down to this much.
1523000	1526000	But it's very, I mean, you know, obviously from the top down,
1526000	1531000	there's a mandate to preserve the humanity and not punish aberration.
1531000	1537000	Like the things that make you different are the things that make you good,
1537000	1539000	not necessarily the things that make you bad.
1539000	1543000	And the way that you win is not necessarily blending in with everyone else.
1543000	1546000	And that's a crucial difference to the show.
1546000	1549000	Because it's, I mean, it's, you know, because it's called King of the Nerds.
1549000	1552000	So it's like, they're actual nerds.
1552000	1555000	It's not like, it's, you know, depending on how you define that,
1555000	1558000	some people might go, why is a guy that only reads comic books a nerd?
1558000	1560000	Because I work for NASA.
1560000	1563000	But there's like, it's like everyone who you could authentically call a nerd,
1563000	1566000	which I think is defined by kind of obsession.
1566000	1567000	I think like...
1567000	1571000	I think that's as good a description as anything.
1571000	1574000	And they come in and they do cry and they do have mental breakdowns
1574000	1579000	and they do reveal pettiness and greed and ambition and embarrassing things.
1579000	1580000	But they're human beings.
1580000	1581000	It's part of it.
1581000	1586000	It feels like, you know, well, this would happen to you too.
1586000	1588000	And it happened to them for a re...
1588000	1591000	No one ever feels like they're walking out and you're going like,
1591000	1593000	oh, fuck that psychopath.
1593000	1594000	Like, I'm glad they're...
1594000	1596000	I hope they get hit by a bus as they leave the show.
1596000	1597000	Right.
1597000	1600000	They're like all like decent people.
1600000	1601000	Yeah.
1601000	1603000	So thank you for making that show.
1603000	1605000	Let me just give you one quick thing.
1605000	1609000	Just to tell you, to give you an idea of how this all works for them.
1609000	1615000	When we did our premiere in January for this season,
1615000	1619000	we wanted to have a party, you know, to do some press and all that.
1619000	1625000	And we sent the word out through Genevieve, who was one of your guests before,
1625000	1630000	to the nerds who had been on the previous seasons saying, you know,
1630000	1633000	in addition to the new nerds, if you want to come, come.
1633000	1636000	And, you know, join us for the party.
1636000	1637000	We're not paying for it.
1637000	1638000	We can't give you any money.
1638000	1639000	We can't fly you here.
1639000	1642000	But if you're here, come to the party.
1642000	1648000	All of season three, this group, all of them showed up.
1648000	1653000	All but one of season two and half of season one.
1653000	1656000	And they all came here on their own dime.
1656000	1658000	They all paid for their own tickets.
1658000	1659000	They found housing.
1659000	1663000	They did all of that stuff because they wanted to be there for that premiere party.
1663000	1664000	That's great.
1664000	1666000	Because normally when people are on contestants on reality shows,
1666000	1669000	they feel pretty flushed down the toilet and thrown away.
1669000	1670000	Exactly.
1670000	1671000	Because like the editing can be so cruel.
1671000	1672000	Yeah, but we don't.
1672000	1673000	It's true.
1673000	1675000	But we don't let go of them, you see.
1675000	1678000	Now, you said earlier that you've always loved nerd culture.
1678000	1683000	When you did Revenge of the Nerds, were you guys aware of nerd culture back then?
1683000	1686000	No, because I don't think there was a lot of nerd culture anyway.
1686000	1687000	I mean, not really.
1687000	1690000	There were Star Trek conventions and so on.
1690000	1694000	And Comic-Cons, but they were like in basements in those days.
1694000	1698000	They weren't corporate behemoths.
1698000	1699000	Yeah, they weren't in the light of day.
1699000	1700000	Right, exactly.
1700000	1703000	I mean, they were all people in their garages.
1703000	1706000	Well, that movie Revenge of the Nerds we were talking about in the green room,
1706000	1709000	it was for me, by my perception,
1709000	1713000	it was the very slow beginning to what we have today,
1713000	1715000	which is just nerd domination of the word.
1715000	1716000	Right.
1716000	1722000	Nerd almost means nothing because what is a nerd when nerds are captains of industry
1722000	1724000	and running the government and we own everything.
1724000	1725000	Exactly.
1725000	1726000	That's really true.
1726000	1731000	And we are the sought-after demographic and I start to worry,
1731000	1732000	should I say we?
1732000	1735000	Because I'm worried I'll get called out on not being an authentic nerd
1735000	1738000	and yet everyone's a fucking nerd.
1738000	1743000	But it goes back to that pivot point.
1743000	1745000	I always associate it with that movie,
1745000	1749000	because it put a label on it and said absolutely from here on out,
1749000	1752000	if you see somebody who's weird in a movie,
1752000	1754000	all those people that we make fun of in the movies when they come through
1754000	1758000	and they go, oh, look, it's purple-durper.
1758000	1762000	From now on, you have to understand that that person is the hero of their own story.
1762000	1766000	You're not allowed to just give them a wedgie and call that a joke anymore.
1766000	1768000	You could do that in meatballs.
1768000	1773000	You could do that in, leading up to that, the preppies could be the heroes.
1773000	1776000	In my memory, every movie before that, that was the joke.
1776000	1779000	Every movie after that, you weren't allowed to do that.
1779000	1782000	The jocks were the good guys until that movie.
1782000	1783000	You're right, yes.
1783000	1786000	What you were saying in the green room, this fascinates me,
1786000	1790000	that that movie was incredibly unsuccessful critically.
1790000	1792000	Critically, it was a disaster.
1792000	1795000	They hated us. They just hated us.
1795000	1799000	At the time, we were consoling ourselves by saying things like,
1799000	1804000	well, all critics are self-loathing nerds, and that's the reason.
1804000	1806000	They see too much of themselves.
1806000	1809000	The director, you said, who I think, I'm going to watch Revenge of the Nerds again,
1809000	1811000	see if it holds up.
1811000	1813000	I want to talk about Better Off Dead in a second.
1813000	1816000	I have watched Better Off Dead since Bobcat was on here.
1816000	1818000	We talked about Savage Steve Holland.
1818000	1820000	I ran home and watched Better Off Dead again.
1820000	1823000	Fuck, it holds the hell up.
1823000	1825000	It's such an important film.
1825000	1828000	Also, Savage Steve, he just kind of trickled away.
1828000	1831000	I want to have him as a guest on here and talk about that.
1831000	1836000	The perceptions of people who are in the Midwest watching this stuff on HBO,
1836000	1841000	Select TV, VHS tapes, that they run into disintegration,
1841000	1843000	which Revenge of the Nerds is one of them.
1843000	1845000	Our perception is cultural efficacy.
1845000	1849000	It's just that, oh, this must be an amazingly influential and successful film,
1849000	1855000	and it is for us, but in some strange emerald city from which it's coming,
1855000	1858000	people are being rewarded and punished on different scales.
1858000	1864000	Jeff Canoe, who directed Revenge of the Nerds, went on to direct Gotcha, you said.
1864000	1866000	I'm acting like I'm an expert.
1866000	1868000	I pumped you for this information.
1868000	1873000	He went on to direct Gotcha, which is the paintball exploitation movie.
1873000	1875000	I remember everything about that movie.
1875000	1877000	I saw it in the theater with my mom.
1877000	1879000	I was like, this is the best.
1879000	1886000	There were those little tracer disc guns that shot little plastic discs that flew pretty well,
1886000	1889000	and I just played Gotcha all the time.
1889000	1893000	I was going around and playing a fake assassin and being a spy with my Gotcha gun.
1893000	1895000	Yes, I am a spy.
1895000	1897000	Sorry, that's from the commercial.
1898000	1905000	This is a good question to ask of him as well,
1905000	1909000	but he was somebody who, if it had not been for Jeff Canoe,
1909000	1916000	that movie wouldn't have had the freedom to develop the way it did and come out the way it did.
1916000	1925000	He was incredibly brilliant at creating an environment in which writers and actors and even producers were involved.
1926000	1934000	He was casting the producers in tiny roles in Revenge of the Nerds and sort of keeping them in the group.
1934000	1936000	And he had this collaborative writing process.
1936000	1938000	He was very, very collaborative.
1938000	1941000	He brought all of us out a week early before shooting,
1941000	1946000	putting us all up in a hotel with the writers and the producers and so on,
1946000	1948000	and we would just sit in the hotel all day.
1948000	1951000	We'd be hanging out at the pool, and then they would call you in,
1951000	1954000	and you would go in, and you would talk about who Booger was.
1955000	1957000	You had to write everything down.
1957000	1963000	I went back to my room, and I did my old acting school job of writing down my biography of Booger.
1963000	1965000	What is Booger's biography?
1965000	1968000	That was really funny, because what wound up happening was,
1968000	1972000	like last year, I was going through a trunk of stuff,
1972000	1976000	and I found this amazing notebook, which I still have,
1976000	1979000	because I was serious.
1979000	1983000	This was an acting thing that you did when you were trained the way I was trained.
1983000	1988000	And I had this booklet, and it's got the bios of all of the characters I played
1988000	1992000	in those early movies, up to about 87.
1992000	1996000	And so I'm looking at it, this er text,
1996000	2000000	and I go into it and I find Booger's biography.
2000000	2006000	I'm reading what I wrote in 1984 as to who I thought Booger was.
2006000	2009000	God damn it, I would have told you to bring that.
2009000	2012000	I can tell you right now, it was me.
2012000	2015000	It was totally me.
2015000	2019000	I was going to ask you, how much of Booger was on the page, on the script before?
2019000	2021000	There was very little, there was almost none.
2021000	2024000	Was there a breakdown for the character that said Booger comes in and he looks like?
2024000	2030000	I didn't audition for Booger, I auditioned for Gilbert, for Anthony's part,
2030000	2033000	which is what I thought I was reading for.
2033000	2037000	That's great, I'm reading for, oh great, I'm working with Bobby Carradine, that's fabulous.
2037000	2044000	And then it turned out that I was actually auditioning for a part that was too small
2044000	2046000	and too disgusting to audition people.
2046000	2048000	You know, you couldn't use Booger.
2048000	2050000	I mean, what is it going to be?
2050000	2056000	It's like, I think the douchebag line, my mother's old douchebag, but that's back in Ohio.
2056000	2060000	That was like the only line that had a beginning and an end, you know, for Booger.
2060000	2063000	It was mainly nose picking and belching.
2063000	2066000	Your character was only nerdy in the sense that you were just completely...
2066000	2068000	You were a sociopath, you were a mystic.
2068000	2069000	Exactly.
2069000	2077000	Booger's only reason for existence is to show how saint-like these other nerds are.
2077000	2081000	You just believe in them so much, like, this guy is the best!
2081000	2085000	What they do is he gets thrown out, I mean, it's sort of a traditional thing.
2085000	2090000	He gets thrown into the outer darkness with them.
2090000	2093000	And they don't even think about it, they just say, oh, you come with us.
2093000	2097000	Okay, so this is an important thing, because you mentioned something, you and I are a similar age,
2097000	2100000	we're sort of the same generation, and then there's a new generation.
2100000	2107000	If you look at Revenge of the Nerds through current eyes, I mean, without rewatching it,
2107000	2111000	I will tell you the fucking unacceptable red flags that are going to come up.
2111000	2117000	There is absolutely nonconsensual sex that converts a woman from being a bad guy to a good guy,
2117000	2122000	because she lets the nerd disguise himself, and then the shit's like, oh, you're so good at cunnilingus.
2122000	2126000	It's just horrible, it's just horrible.
2126000	2128000	Is it Darth Vader, too?
2128000	2133000	By our modern definitions, there's racism, there's homophobia, there's, I mean,
2133000	2138000	there's a million crimes that we've come, as we've progressed, like, now you look back 30 years,
2138000	2140000	and it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2140000	2141000	It's really true.
2141000	2146000	The important kind of, like, socio-political, like, subversive element, though,
2146000	2151000	and that's where Booker comes in, is the idea that that was the first time in my consciousness
2151000	2156000	that we put a word on nerd, but the whole idea of the movie that was demonstrated,
2156000	2160000	not just in that final monologue, oh, we're all nerds, and then even the beautiful people are saying,
2160000	2164000	I'm a nerd, too, but more importantly, throughout the first and second act,
2164000	2170000	this creeping realization that the word nerd has no boundary except that you are the other,
2170000	2174000	which means that if you smoke weed, you're a nerd, which means that if you're a groat,
2175000	2178000	which means that, and what is the common hub?
2178000	2186000	It is being divested of your right to prejudice, because there is a gay man within the nerds.
2186000	2187000	A gay black man.
2187000	2192000	He is not immediately sussed out for his aberration. He is ignored.
2192000	2194000	He is welcomed.
2194000	2201000	It's never questioned, and when we go to you and Jefferson, because we want the Lambda Lambda Lambda to support us,
2201000	2206000	we say that there will be no prejudice, which we think will get us in with him, Bernie Casey.
2206000	2213000	There won't be any prejudice according to race or creed, and Larry B., who plays Lamar, says,
2213000	2219000	or sexual orientation, which is like a joke that would work now.
2219000	2226000	I mean, if you were doing that kind of a parody on that sort of thing.
2227000	2233000	They meant it as a parable for antisemitism. That's what the writers meant.
2233000	2234000	Oh, really?
2234000	2236000	Listen, I just found that out about Superman.
2236000	2240000	I remember hating that and then learning that two Jewish kids created it.
2240000	2246000	It was the same thing, and they did that, the burning nerds on the lawn and all of that.
2246000	2251000	They were going into these, which were at the time for people our age,
2251000	2264000	they were these strong cultural flags of something that had been going on in the 60s and the 70s that we were supposedly coming out of now,
2264000	2268000	which, of course, we haven't, but that was the idea.
2268000	2270000	Revenge of the nerds.
2270000	2275000	I was making a drink, and I didn't know what to say.
2275000	2278000	I could keep talking while you were doing that.
2278000	2284000	I want to hear, now it's time to talk about Better Off Dead, which is what you really want to talk about anyway.
2284000	2286000	Well, kind of, but I don't want you to talk out of school.
2286000	2293000	That's a movie. I did a reference to that movie, not knowing you were going to be here, I think, last week or the week before.
2293000	2299000	That's a movie that I think, I know I quote a couple times a week ever since I've seen it.
2299000	2305000	It's also like, it's a thing that when something happens, everybody in the room of a certain age all says the same line.
2305000	2310000	I've never seen snow without quoting you from that movie, because that is a great fucking line.
2310000	2311000	Which one?
2311000	2314000	Any idea what the street value of mountain would be?
2314000	2325000	My favorite moment in Better Off Dead is when the bad guy skis to a stop, and then there's John Cusack,
2325000	2333000	and there's his cute girlfriend who's going to get stolen by the bad guy, and then there's Curtis' character standing next to him.
2334000	2341000	The bad guy, the preppy bad guy, looking at Cusack's girlfriend goes like,
2341000	2344000	you're a cute little thing, what's your name?
2344000	2351000	With incredible sincerity, you step over and go, Charles Dumar?
2351000	2358000	You're not being the guy who's like, you're not the animal house subversion.
2358000	2364000	Your character in that movie is like an interesting tweak on the nerd character because he's absolutely like,
2364000	2370000	he doesn't ever seem to really take any sides, and he's very happy to be called a cute little thing
2370000	2374000	and help that guy with his skiing if that's what he wanted in that moment.
2374000	2377000	Yes, I'll hold your clip for it.
2377000	2389000	It was such an odd movie because it was a story that was pretty typical,
2389000	2393000	that was being filtered through his sensibility, which no one was aware of at the time.
2393000	2400000	He was very new, he was 24 I think, and he was making this, you know, what was basically a, you know, this was a real movie.
2400000	2407000	How many of you guys, how many of you have seen Better Up Dead?
2407000	2412000	More accurately, by applause, honestly, who has not seen the movie?
2412000	2414000	Wow, a lot of people.
2414000	2417000	It's creeping in, I mean, this is, we're getting old, we're getting old.
2417000	2424000	See, this is the thing, now it's like me talking to somebody your age about movies that,
2424000	2429000	when I was your age, I thought would never go away, and they've already gone.
2429000	2431000	I mean, Better Up Dead, it didn't occur.
2431000	2433000	You mean like Birth of a Nation?
2433000	2435000	Yeah, those kinds of movies.
2435000	2438000	I was growing up, we were all growing up on John Hughes movies,
2438000	2442000	and it did, when I rewatched Better Up Dead, what I finally realized,
2442000	2445000	having become in my old age a kind of John Hughes expert,
2445000	2452000	was that the thing about Better Up Dead was its departure from the John Hughes mainline,
2452000	2455000	and there was no other way to express it when you were back then,
2455000	2458000	except that it's a weird movie, it's a crazy movie, it's weird, but it was like,
2458000	2462000	a weird movie would be, you know, Easy Rider.
2462000	2464000	I mean, it would just be about something weird.
2464000	2469000	This is about sex and teenage life and going to prom and winning ski competitions.
2469000	2479000	The tone of it, the reality is like, it's not grounded in the John Hughes-like reality,
2479000	2483000	where you can live and die by what someone feels.
2483000	2486000	And there's comedy sketches that keep recurring through it.
2486000	2488000	It just breaks genre all the time.
2488000	2490000	Well, the universe is absurd.
2490000	2494000	There are so many things about the universe that make absolutely no sense,
2494000	2498000	that I would imagine a normal producer would immediately say,
2498000	2501000	with all the best intentions, you can't do that.
2501000	2502000	I know you think that's fun.
2502000	2506000	The reason you think that's fun is because you're bored,
2506000	2509000	and you're a director, or you're a writer, and you want to have fun,
2509000	2512000	but the audience doesn't want to have that much fun.
2513000	2517000	I say this all the time when I'm making my TV show.
2517000	2521000	I'm constantly going, let's not freak them out.
2521000	2523000	They want to believe these people are real,
2523000	2526000	so that we can continue to have fun for a thousand years.
2526000	2533000	But then, the thing that I've learned in doing community is that,
2533000	2538000	as long as when people, if somebody is betrayed,
2538000	2541000	if they feel betrayed, and you believe they're betrayed,
2541000	2545000	it doesn't matter if the moon is a dick.
2545000	2548000	The universe can just be anything.
2548000	2550000	You can be in outer space.
2550000	2552000	You can just cut to anything.
2552000	2557000	We're all pickles now, but as long as you have to pick that one channel
2557000	2562000	to be consistent with the physics of emotional consistency.
2562000	2565000	Why wouldn't that guy say that that guy was an asshole?
2565000	2568000	He just was an asshole to him.
2568000	2569000	I don't care if they're pickles.
2569000	2570000	I'm not going to ask why they're pickles.
2570000	2575000	We didn't ask why Snoopy didn't run out of room in his doghouse.
2575000	2578000	We were held to the ground.
2578000	2579000	I did.
2579000	2580000	You did?
2580000	2581000	I wondered that.
2581000	2582000	Remember those letters?
2582000	2584000	Do you ever read about who's the father of Mr. Brady on the Brady Bunch?
2584000	2585000	Shaw?
2585000	2586000	What was his name?
2586000	2590000	Who's the actor that played Father Brady on the Brady Bunch?
2590000	2592000	I can't think of his name.
2592000	2594000	Well, he'd be happy right now.
2594000	2596000	What the hell's his name?
2596000	2598000	Greg Brady?
2598000	2600000	No, that can't be correct.
2600000	2602000	He would get these big fights with Sherwood Schwartz.
2602000	2603000	Robert...
2603000	2604000	Robert...
2604000	2606000	No, I thought...
2606000	2607000	Reed.
2607000	2608000	Robert Reed.
2608000	2609000	Is that it?
2609000	2610000	Is it Robert Reed?
2610000	2612000	Did I get half of it right?
2612000	2613000	I'm sorry.
2613000	2614000	I almost said Robert Shaw.
2614000	2615000	I should have known that.
2615000	2619000	But he would get these big arguments with letters back and forth with Sherwood Schwartz
2619000	2622000	and say, there cannot be a pie fight.
2622000	2627000	Like, you cannot have a family in a house and all of a sudden go into slapstick
2627000	2629000	and Sherwood Schwartz said, we're making a TV show.
2629000	2630000	We're having a good time.
2630000	2632000	Like, no, but there's rules that have to be adhered to.
2632000	2633000	Yeah.
2633000	2637000	And he was determined to keep there to be logic within the world of the Brady Bunch.
2637000	2640000	But like, the audience, like, I love the pie fights on the Brady Bunch.
2640000	2641000	It was great.
2641000	2647000	Well, you know, I think it's also in the case of the movies, it was an interesting time
2647000	2651000	because I think that period around the 80s, the beginning of the 80s, mid 80s,
2651000	2657000	was the last time you could really do a movie like Better Off Dead
2657000	2664000	and have it be produced by a major film company and released in theaters
2664000	2669000	with these actors in it who, you know, I mean, John Cusack was not anybody
2669000	2671000	who anyone really knew at the time.
2671000	2673000	And certainly none of the rest of it.
2673000	2676000	Kim Darby was probably the biggest star among us, you know.
2676000	2677000	Who was that?
2677000	2678000	Kim Darby.
2678000	2679000	You don't know who Kim Darby is?
2679000	2680000	Who's Kim Darby in?
2680000	2681000	I love that you don't know.
2681000	2683000	Kim Darby was in the original.
2683000	2688000	She played Cusack's mother in Lane's Mother in Better Off Dead.
2688000	2694000	And she was the original girl in True Grit, the John Wayne True Grit.
2694000	2695000	Was it right?
2695000	2696000	Yeah.
2696000	2697000	She's French dressing and French fries?
2697000	2698000	French fries.
2698000	2699000	That's her?
2699000	2700000	Yeah, that's her.
2700000	2701000	I quoted that a couple of days ago.
2701000	2702000	Yeah.
2702000	2703000	We just saw her.
2703000	2704000	I mean, we just did a reading.
2704000	2705000	Well, she's the little girl in True Grit with John Wayne.
2705000	2706000	In True Grit with John Wayne.
2706000	2707000	I did not know that.
2707000	2708000	Well, see, there you are.
2708000	2709000	You learned something tonight.
2709000	2710000	You learned something really cool.
2710000	2711000	Yeah.
2711000	2712000	I don't know what I would have done.
2712000	2716000	I don't know who I'd be if I didn't have that movie in my life.
2716000	2720000	John Cusack's character in that movie lived in a house that was roughly the size of mine.
2720000	2723000	It looked like a real house, too.
2723000	2728520	He didn't have the problems I had, but he lived in a world that I did in that I felt
2728520	2730200	completely alienated.
2730200	2736920	It was better expressed by that director than God bless him for all of his incredibly important
2736920	2738520	work, John Hughes.
2738520	2744480	But I mean, it was more poignantly expressed through an absurdist lens by this more punk
2744480	2748840	rock director saying, let's go more extreme with this.
2748840	2751720	Let's just say I want to kill myself.
2751720	2755000	Let's have me try to kill myself.
2755000	2758500	Let's express how I feel through animation.
2758500	2763680	Let's express how I feel through characters that could not exist in real life, like coming
2763680	2764680	at me.
2764680	2769120	The net result will be that I feel beleaguered, that I feel like I want to kill myself.
2769120	2770120	That is just so well put.
2770120	2776080	I'll also have to go into voiceover narration when the two Asian guys come up.
2776080	2777080	Are you asking who did that?
2777080	2778080	No, no.
2778080	2779080	Just to do that.
2779080	2780080	The fact that it happened?
2780080	2781080	Just to do that.
2781080	2782080	It's hilarious.
2782080	2783080	Yeah, I know.
2783080	2785360	And also, you know it's coming back for the third time.
2785360	2788200	The second time it happens, it's going to happen a third time, and it's going to be
2788200	2790320	at a great point in the movie.
2790320	2791360	I want my $2.
2791360	2792360	That has to pay off.
2792360	2793360	Yes.
2794040	2795040	I have to keep recurring.
2795040	2796040	It's wonderful.
2796040	2797040	Yeah.
2797040	2800040	Better off dead.
2800040	2803920	Not to be a jerk, because I get to work with very frequently, and I love him to pieces,
2803920	2807160	and we've talked about it quite a bit, and he has wonderful stories as Joel Murray.
2807160	2808160	Oh, yeah.
2808160	2812680	And he said the shooting of One Crazy Summer, that you guys were in Nantucket or Martha's
2812680	2813680	Vineyard?
2813680	2814680	Or where were you guys?
2814680	2815680	We were in Nantucket.
2815680	2819840	And he's got awesome, like, ribbled, sexy stories about what you guys got to do.
2819840	2822680	Well, I was not in that.
2822680	2824440	I'm noticeably not in any of those stories.
2824440	2825440	Aren't you in that one?
2825440	2826440	No, no.
2826440	2827440	I'm in the movie.
2827440	2828440	Yeah.
2828440	2829440	But I wasn't in any of the sexy movies.
2829440	2830440	All right.
2830440	2832320	I missed all of those.
2832320	2833320	I was, you know...
2833320	2834320	I'm a little kiddie.
2834320	2835320	I was too bad, because he has some really...
2835320	2836320	I know.
2836320	2837320	I know.
2837320	2838320	He has some doozies.
2838320	2839320	Yeah.
2839320	2840320	Joel did great.
2840320	2841320	You know?
2841320	2843320	Bill's younger brother, you know?
2843320	2845440	He's the youngest of the Murray brothers.
2845440	2847440	He's number nine out of nine.
2847440	2848440	Yeah.
2848440	2851880	Now, because it happened on Twitter, so you could tell this story, right, that you were
2851880	2854160	just telling me about the Kuzak show?
2854160	2859240	Oh, just an interesting story, yeah, that, you know, I mean, of course, many of you here
2859240	2862120	have not actually seen Better Off Dead, but...
2862120	2863640	The legend is the Kuzak...
2863640	2864640	Hated the movie.
2864640	2865640	Not a fan of the movie.
2865640	2867240	And I will...
2867240	2869480	Let me lend this, because you're not talking about school.
2869480	2870480	I am.
2870480	2873160	Rob Shrob was up to direct Hot Tub Time Machine long ago.
2873160	2875920	He had a meeting with Kuzak, where he...
2875920	2881080	Rob's going to be very angry at me about something, like, he came back from that meeting.
2881760	2886920	I won't go into specifics, but he had a conversation that he came away from, saying, oh, my God,
2886920	2889040	John Kuzak doesn't like Better Off Dead.
2889040	2890040	Okay.
2890040	2892480	So, it's out there.
2892480	2895000	It's out there that he was not happy with the movie.
2895000	2898200	And then, we had to make a second movie.
2898200	2901240	The following year, we made a second movie with almost the same cast.
2901240	2903080	Because it was like a two-picture deal, or...?
2903080	2906120	Yeah, it was supposedly the first two or three movies.
2906120	2909720	And the legend that I've heard is that Kuzak had not seen Better Off Dead.
2909720	2910720	No, that's not true.
2911520	2912520	He had seen it.
2912520	2913520	Okay.
2913520	2919520	Before they started shooting One Crazy Summer, there was a screening of Better Off Dead.
2919520	2923960	That might have happened, because I wasn't in Nantucket when they started filming, so
2923960	2926240	they may have screened it there.
2926240	2928760	So that there was like this new director who was like this...
2928760	2934040	I knew that he had not been happy with the movie, that movie.
2934040	2935760	They're starting One Crazy Summer, and it's like...
2935760	2940640	So they're starting a second movie with the same director, and an actor who is not happy
2940640	2944760	with the first movie is what appeared to be the case.
2944760	2951200	And over the years, the legends have just gotten ridiculous, where everybody says, well,
2951200	2958360	not only does he hate it, but he abuses people who refer to it.
2958360	2964520	And he actually, if he's handed something to sign, and it has something to do with Better
2964520	2968240	Off Dead, he will tear it up and throw it away.
2968240	2970760	I mean, the stories became legitimate.
2970760	2971760	Are those verifiable?
2971760	2972760	No!
2972760	2973760	No!
2973760	2974760	It's just...
2974760	2978640	I heard he stabbed a child one time, is that true?
2978640	2980640	Because his name was Betty.
2980640	2981640	His name was Lane.
2981640	2986520	One woman said, I want my two dollars as a joke.
2986520	2989080	No.
2989080	2990520	These are the kinds of things...
2990520	2997280	Okay, the end of the story, as you're asking for, is that we did this reading three weeks
2997280	3001320	ago in San Francisco for Sketchfest.
3001320	3006320	And Savage was there, and a bunch of us from the movie, Kim Darby, Diane Franklin, Amanda
3006320	3009080	Weiss, we were all there, and we were reading the script.
3009080	3010080	Reading Better Off Dead?
3010080	3011080	Better Off Dead.
3011080	3012600	But Cusack is not there.
3012600	3018040	So the next day, I'm getting all these Twitter questions from people saying, where's Cusack?
3018040	3019200	Why wasn't Cusack there?
3019200	3020600	Why didn't you invite Cusack?
3020600	3022000	That's bullshit, man.
3022000	3023280	You should have had Cusack there.
3023280	3026000	It was his movie, and all this stuff, and going on and on.
3026000	3030520	And I usually don't respond to that kind of thing, but I finally wrote a tweet and
3030520	3034600	said, you know, John's not a fan of the film.
3034600	3035640	And that's the truth.
3035640	3037080	So that's why he wasn't there.
3037080	3038480	It's not like we didn't want him there.
3038480	3040280	We would have loved to have had him.
3040280	3042440	Doesn't like the movie.
3042440	3054080	Ten minutes later, John Cusack tweets, not true.
3054080	3057880	I love Twitter so fucking much.
3057880	3060440	I mean, you wouldn't be here with that for Twitter.
3060440	3061440	I know.
3061440	3070000	And so it winds up, John and I, I had not spoken to John in 25 years, probably.
3070000	3071000	And we never followed each other on Twitter.
3071000	3073080	Because he loved the movie so much.
3073080	3076080	He loved the movie so much.
3076080	3080200	To talk to his co-stars would be to tamper with that memory.
3080200	3082560	Nah, it's just, you know, you don't.
3082560	3086160	I mean, you move on in your life and you just don't, you know, you don't live in each
3086160	3087160	other's pants.
3087160	3088160	Exactly.
3088160	3090160	It's just you move on.
3090160	3097800	So so it's been a long time, but it's it's been a long time and we don't follow each
3097800	3099360	other on Twitter.
3099360	3102880	So suddenly he's following me on Twitter.
3102880	3107280	So I follow him because he must have got zoomed by a thousand tweets, of course, of course.
3107280	3112760	And then we start direct messaging about it.
3112760	3119000	And it was so wonderful to hear, you know, I mean, whatever his feelings had been, you
3119000	3124480	know, he was it was really great to to get some nice.
3124480	3125480	What was that?
3125480	3129680	What was the kind of the the the takeaway from that conversation was he just I mean,
3129680	3132080	he says, you know, I hated the music.
3132080	3133960	I remember he said that he hated the music.
3133960	3135560	Well, that's 80s music.
3135560	3138600	I mean, I hate everybody hates 80s music.
3138600	3143480	But was he sort of like was the when you who sent the first direct message among a 14 year
3143480	3152360	old girl right now or boy, he sent he sent the first one because what happened was he
3152360	3156560	sent this out a regular tweet, but he tagged me.
3156560	3159320	So when I followed him, he saw me.
3159320	3163600	So he followed me and then he followed up on his initial tweet, right?
3163600	3167760	In which he said more about what, you know, what his feelings were.
3167760	3172360	So he didn't know who sent the first direct message to he did to me to you following up
3172360	3174360	that following what he said already.
3174360	3178720	He's saying, hey, hey, Curtis, just so you know, like, I really I really love that movie
3178720	3180720	or he didn't say that.
3180720	3182520	It was it was subtler than that.
3182520	3187760	It was more like just so you know, you know, it's a big mistake to spread rumors about
3187760	3188760	the goose.
3188760	3189760	Well, no, no.
3190760	3193760	This is the two ends of the spectrum.
3201760	3205760	If you mess with the goose, you know, Joel Murray did what you did five years ago.
3205760	3207760	Now he's doing improv with Jeff Davis.
3209760	3210760	I will bury you.
3213760	3217760	Oh, so he didn't come out and say retract that he at one point.
3217760	3221760	No, look, you know what, there's it's all you know, what what winds up happening is
3221760	3227760	and I said this when I when I messaged him back, I said, this is what happens when you
3227760	3231760	when you communicate through, you know, playing telephone.
3231760	3234760	You know, to use a really old thing.
3234760	3235760	You know, it's older than that.
3235760	3236760	Chinese telephone.
3238760	3240760	That was an expression.
3240760	3245760	I said, you know, you say one thing, somebody then comes to me and says, did you hear what
3245760	3246760	he said?
3246760	3248760	And I go, oh, geez, he said that.
3248760	3250760	And then it goes back and forth and back and forth.
3250760	3251760	And that was the way.
3251760	3252760	That was the way.
3252760	3254760	So how are things left with you and he?
3255760	3256760	Fine.
3256760	3257760	Fine.
3257760	3258760	Yeah.
3258760	3259760	I mean, you guys going to hang out?
3259760	3260760	No.
3260760	3261760	You're going to.
3261760	3262760	Are you going to help him ski the 4K?
3262760	3263760	The 5K.
3263760	3264760	12K.
3264760	3265760	12K.
3265760	3266760	12K.
3266760	3268760	Now the 12K dude.
3268760	3272760	When I hear this is just me projecting onto him.
3272760	3273760	He even does my voice.
3273760	3275760	It's a little scary.
3275760	3276760	That's unintentional.
3276760	3277760	No, no.
3277760	3280760	I kind of sound like you regardless.
3286760	3288760	The 12K dude.
3289760	3290760	That's not bad.
3290760	3291760	Believe me.
3291760	3293760	It's funny or in context.
3295760	3299760	There's that scene when he's making the burgers and Van Halen starts singing that terrible.
3299760	3301760	It's not a good Van Halen song, by the way, for my money.
3301760	3304760	And he starts doing animation with the burgers and the thing.
3304760	3308760	If there was a scene, if I were John Cusack and I looked back at the screening of that,
3308760	3313760	I would not be proud of that scene because it's pretty, pretty hambone.
3313760	3318760	And so when I hear him say he doesn't like the music, I think he's embarrassed about that one scene more specifically.
3318760	3323760	Well, that could be, but that takes me into a whole area that I can't even comment on.
3323760	3326760	And that also makes me wonder, well, how does he feel about tape heads?
3326760	3328760	Is he like a, he must be like a hipster.
3328760	3330760	Like he must love tape heads.
3330760	3332760	I have no idea what he looks like.
3332760	3334760	I just remember tape heads, which was an equal default.
3334760	3336760	I remember that with Timothy.
3336760	3339760	And I bet that had a lot more street cred with music.
3339760	3341760	Well, it was an independent movie.
3341760	3344760	I was working for that company when it was made, actually.
3344760	3350760	And that was a sort of low budget, independent, edgy movie of the time, and Tim Robbins.
3350760	3356760	How is it that you, so you're this guy in Better Off Dead, which by the way, what order is that in?
3356760	3358760	When are you booger in relation to Better Off Dead?
3358760	3359760	I don't even know.
3359760	3365760	It goes Revenge of the Nerds and Better Off Dead the same year.
3365760	3366760	Okay.
3366760	3367760	But Better Off Dead second.
3367760	3369760	So my confusion is forgivable.
3369760	3370760	Yes.
3370760	3378760	And then there's, so where you, how does that, I want to hear the kind of story about you going from,
3378760	3383760	I think every actor has that fork on the road career story.
3383760	3388760	Your one bedroom apartment and you're thinking of moving back to, where are you from, by the way?
3388760	3389760	I'm from Detroit.
3389760	3390760	Okay.
3390760	3392760	So you're in LA, I'm assuming.
3392760	3395760	No, I was in New York then, actually.
3395760	3397760	So what's the threshold?
3397760	3399760	What's the red light that you don't hit?
3399760	3401760	I think it was moonlighting, actually.
3401760	3402760	It was none of those.
3402760	3403760	Wait, what do you mean?
3403760	3404760	Oh, it's right.
3404760	3405760	You have moonlighting.
3405760	3406760	Well, I mean, but that was.
3406760	3408760	God damn, I forgot about it.
3408760	3410760	I fucking love that joke.
3410760	3411760	That's not fair, though.
3411760	3412760	I knew that.
3412760	3413760	I was going to talk about it.
3413760	3414760	I didn't know I forgot about it.
3414760	3416760	But that's way after.
3416760	3417760	That's after all that.
3417760	3418760	Yeah, I know.
3418760	3422760	But I was still living in New York the whole time, and I would do the movies.
3422760	3424760	You don't have to realize.
3424760	3426760	You're telling me that in your.
3426760	3429760	In my head, this is what I was thinking.
3429760	3432760	This will give you a great idea, because I started in the theater, okay?
3432760	3440760	So I was working from mid-70s to my first movie, which was Risky Business, which was the year before.
3440760	3442760	Risky Business, I forgot.
3442760	3443760	I knew that one.
3443760	3444760	How can I forget that?
3444760	3447760	You had the line of the defines Risky Business.
3447760	3448760	Right.
3448760	3451760	This is Risky Business, man.
3451760	3453760	That's kind of like that.
3453760	3456760	Jesus Christ, this business is risky.
3456760	3465760	Do you have an idea of how risky this business is?
3465760	3467760	I forgot you were in.
3467760	3468760	I was in it.
3468760	3469760	I was in that.
3469760	3470760	And but.
3470760	3473760	This business is pure risk.
3473760	3481760	They put me in that movie, and I thought it was the only movie I would ever make, because I was not thinking in terms of movies.
3481760	3483760	I was thinking in terms of stage.
3483760	3496760	So when I did Risky Business, I kept a journal every day that I was on the movie for 11 weeks or 10 weeks, only because I wanted to remember what making a movie was like.
3496760	3502760	I really thought I would then just go back to doing regional theater and doing stuff in New York and that.
3502760	3503760	And that was going to be it.
3503760	3506760	Are you a song and dance man, or are you just a dramatic?
3506760	3507760	You want to play Willie Loman?
3507760	3509760	You want to.
3509760	3515760	No, I just do the same rubbish on stage that I do on film.
3515760	3517760	So OK, so was Risky.
3517760	3519760	Where was Risky Business in this?
3519760	3520760	Better off dead slash.
3520760	3522760	Eighty three was Risky Business.
3522760	3524760	Eighty four was Revenge of the Nerds.
3524760	3525760	Better off dead.
3525760	3526760	Oh, God damn it.
3526760	3529760	I kept Risky Business out of nowhere.
3529760	3546760	Anyway, my point is that what all of that was going on in the movies, the movie things, it was only when I got moonlighting that I actually was out here and working here and realizing I couldn't go anywhere because we were working 10 months out of the year.
3546760	3551760	So you've always been sort of like on shore leave from the stage.
3551760	3553760	Not now.
3553760	3555760	I mean, it's hard for me to even think about it now.
3555760	3560760	It's so funny because I mean, you were you were booger slash Charles Dumar.
3560760	3567760	And and then I yeah, at some point I bothered to see Risky Business, but it was about like sexy people.
3567760	3569760	And I wasn't right.
3569760	3571760	I forgot that you were in that.
3571760	3576760	And like a nice moonlighting was my favorite show.
3576760	3578760	And I was watching it every night.
3578760	3582760	And I remember when you arrived as Mr. Pesto's lover.
3582760	3585760	And I remember thinking like, oh, fuck him.
3585760	3588760	He sold out. Right.
3588760	3591760	Well, but you were thinking, and so it begins.
3591760	3593760	I guess I'm not going back to the stage.
3593760	3596760	I was thinking I now have more than two hundred dollars.
3596760	3598760	Right.
3598760	3600760	Because you're just doing these movies that were.
3600760	3602760	Yeah, that's despite their cultural efficacy.
3602760	3606760	I mean, now it seems like I must have been just making a fortune.
3606760	3611760	And that's everyone's perception of everyone they see on screen.
3611760	3613760	Yeah. Wow. All right.
3613760	3621760	That's that's why it was so I mean, because, you know, you do those movies and I did maybe six movies in the whole decade, six or seven movies.
3621760	3624760	And that was it. Everything else I was doing was stage.
3624760	3626760	You know, there was no money at all.
3626760	3630760	Do you have anywhere to be when now tonight?
3630760	3632760	No, I was going to be here with you. Right.
3632760	3635760	I sort of I sort of cleared my heart out.
3635760	3640760	This is the point where Dan's afraid to to keep his guests as much as he wants you to stay.
3641760	3644760	I'm I'm I'm still good if you're OK.
3644760	3646760	You're allowed to fuck straight off if you want to go.
3646760	3648760	But we would love to have you stay.
3648760	3652760	I'm going to bring out my some of my other.
3652760	3653760	Thank you.
3655760	3657760	It's Spencer back there.
3657760	3659760	Spencer, are you in the house?
3659760	3661760	All right, Spencer, everybody.
3661760	3662760	Spencer, Chris.
3670760	3679760	Oh, oh, my goodness.
3679760	3682760	Oh, oh, it's great to be here.
3682760	3686760	Spencer Spencer, did you willfully ignore the most important high five of my life?
3686760	3687760	Wait, what are you talking about?
3687760	3690760	I just hung a high five out there and you walked right by.
3690760	3693760	Oh, I thought you were like, yay, Spencer.
3693760	3694760	Yeah, yes.
3694760	3696760	But I wanted to make physical contact.
3696760	3698760	I always want to make physical contact.
3699760	3701760	I'm going to fuck the shit out of you after the show.
3701760	3709760	Spencer, were you affected in your upbringing by any of Curtis Armstrong's
3711760	3714760	Oh, totally.
3714760	3719760	Like when I was in middle school, I remember there's these kids talking about this movie.
3719760	3723760	And I was like, that sounds like the best movie I've ever heard.
3723760	3725760	And it was Revenge of the Nerds.
3725760	3730760	And it influenced my life.
3730760	3734760	It almost sounds like the answer he'd have if he was just trying to stay out of trouble.
3734760	3736760	Right, exactly.
3736760	3742760	I definitely remember now that you guys bring it up that kids in middle school were talking about it.
3742760	3744760	And I was like, that sounds crazy.
3744760	3746760	I don't really watch movies.
3746760	3748760	I hate to admit it.
3748760	3754760	But yeah, it's a huge problem in my life because everyone's all like, oh, it's like a risky business.
3754760	3756760	And I'm like, I don't know what you mean.
3756760	3761760	Why is this guy wearing underwear?
3761760	3764760	You miss all these reference points.
3764760	3765760	I don't know.
3765760	3769760	What are you guys up to?
3769760	3775760	There was at least an entire episode of moonlighting where it was you and Mr. Pesto.
3775760	3778760	That would happen a lot in broadcast TV back then.
3778760	3781760	I remember an episode of Miami Vice when Crockett and Tubbs know where to be found.
3781760	3782760	And there were just two guys.
3783760	3788760	Those were always the episodes at Christmas when the stars got to leave on December 1st.
3788760	3790760	And they had no one to film.
3790760	3792760	So they would film us.
3792760	3795760	How was Sybil Shepard to work with, if I may ask?
3795760	3799760	Well, I never had a problem with Sybil Shepard, actually.
3799760	3801760	She was a bit notorious later on.
3801760	3806760	They were both notorious, actually, at different points.
3806760	3810760	But I never had a problem as far as acting.
3810760	3811760	I never had a problem.
3811760	3813760	My favorite memory of that is my family all watched that.
3813760	3817760	We didn't watch a lot of shows all as a family, but we watched it together.
3817760	3820760	But every time Sybil Shepard was on screen, it was so gauzed out.
3820760	3821760	She had this incredible filter.
3821760	3823760	Yeah, they would joke about that on the show.
3823760	3824760	They did.
3824760	3827760	They made a joke about the filters.
3827760	3830760	Yeah, she came out into the office and saw the camera.
3830760	3834760	Jerry Fenderman was the DP on moonlighting.
3834760	3837760	He was the DP on the original Star Trek.
3837760	3842760	And if you watch the original Star Trek, every time there's a beautiful alien woman,
3842760	3845760	there will be Kirk, and it's just Kirk.
3845760	3850760	And then it goes to her close-up, and it's like you can barely see.
3850760	3852760	Somebody's wrapped Vaseline over the lens.
3852760	3854760	The Vaseline that they've got on the lens.
3854760	3860760	And it was Jerry Fenderman's signature.
3860760	3866760	And so he was still doing it in the 80s when it was actually now probably not such a good idea.
3866760	3870760	I heard someone back there.
3870760	3871760	Oh, very good.
3871760	3872760	Yeah, thank you, thank you.
3872760	3873760	Very good.
3873760	3874760	See, I got that.
3874760	3878760	We've mentioned nerddom, Star Trek, and a bunch of things.
3878760	3880760	We haven't even talked about Leonard Nimoy, man.
3880760	3881760	I know.
3881760	3884760	Oh, Leonard Nimoy past.
3884760	3886760	A life well lived.
3886760	3891760	That's one of those mission accomplished deaths that's like, oh, great to live forever.
3891760	3895760	But we were, you know, 15 years ago, we had made our peace.
3895760	3902760	Well, I expected you to laugh.
3902760	3903760	I don't know.
3903760	3905760	That one landed on the foul line.
3905760	3906760	I don't know.
3906760	3908760	It was supposed to land so far out that it was funny.
3908760	3911760	Like, I was supposed to, I was supposed to, I was making fun of myself.
3911760	3914760	Instead of sounding like you wished him dead 15 years ago.
3914760	3915760	Yeah.
3915760	3918760	It may be too soon, man, for that joke.
3919760	3923760	No, I mean, it's, it's what a, what a, yeah.
3923760	3925760	The end of an era for sure.
3925760	3929760	Spencer, did original series Star Trek ever cross your path?
3929760	3933760	No, but I did enjoy that ballad of Bilbo Baggins there.
3933760	3934760	Yeah.
3934760	3938760	I remember that from his second album.
3938760	3942760	These best two sides of Leonard Nimoy.
3942760	3945760	I consider it, I consider it kind of his Sergeant Pepper.
3945760	3946760	Yeah.
3946760	3947760	No, definitely.
3947760	3949760	Two sides of Leonard Nimoy was depicted graphically.
3949760	3953760	Like, was it like, like, you know Leonard Nimoy as this like Vulcan esque guy.
3953760	3958760	It was exactly the album was called two sides of Leonard Nimoy and it,
3958760	3959760	two pictures in profile.
3959760	3964760	One of Leonard as a, as Leonard and the other as Spock.
3964760	3966760	There's a great photo that proof sent me today.
3966760	3969760	It's a, it's him and a turtleneck hanging out with Jimi Hendrix.
3969760	3970760	And it's like, yeah.
3970760	3971760	Yeah.
3971760	3973760	Because you see when that, that's weird, isn't it?
3973760	3975760	That there was a time when those things.
3975760	3978760	Jimi looks more excited to be with Leonard Nimoy than vice versa.
3978760	3983760	Well, can you imagine being like, like, like, and it being alive at a time,
3983760	3987760	like working at a time when Star Trek was on the air or it was almost like,
3987760	3990760	and then Spock walking into a party.
3990760	3991760	Like, are you fucking kidding me?
3991760	3992760	Yeah.
3992760	3993760	Like we get excited about Jeff Goldblum.
3993760	3996760	Like, oh, he's kind of the Spock of Jurassic Park.
3996760	3998760	I don't know.
3998760	4004760	Like, it's not, there's nothing like, like, I mean, Spock walked in the door.
4004760	4007760	That must have been amazing.
4007760	4012760	Specifically Leonard Nimoy, like such a crazy, like a striking looking guy.
4012760	4017760	Oh, it's 9-11 and don't we have a, were we going to do a new tradition at 9-11?
4017760	4018760	What was it?
4018760	4019760	I forget.
4019760	4020760	It was make a wish.
4020760	4021760	Oh yeah.
4021760	4022760	What's your 9-11 wish?
4022760	4025760	I wish, I wish for no more 9-11s, but all right.
4025760	4026760	Let's forget that.
4026760	4029760	I wish Leonard Nimoy dropped dead 15 years ago.
4035760	4037760	Curtis, do you want to make a wish?
4037760	4039760	It's still 9-11.
4039760	4042760	Make your 9-11 wish before it's over.
4042760	4043760	No, I can't.
4043760	4044760	I can't.
4044760	4045760	That's too much pressure for me.
4045760	4047760	Spencer, get a 9-11 wish.
4047760	4050760	I just want to be, we didn't actually settle.
4050760	4053760	That was one of the pitches was to make a wish, but that was not where we settled.
4053760	4056760	I thought there was one that I jazzed to more than a wish.
4056760	4057760	Yeah, exactly.
4057760	4059760	There was, I don't know what it is.
4059760	4061760	Anybody recall from last week?
4061760	4063760	I just love killing momentum.
4063760	4064760	Whoa.
4064760	4065760	Wow.
4065760	4067760	It's more of an opportunity.
4067760	4069760	That guy came to 9-11 during 9-11.
4069760	4072760	I just made a new wish, motherfucker.
4074760	4076760	Did my wife ever make it here?
4076760	4077760	Is she in the back?
4077760	4078760	Is Aaron you here?
4078760	4079760	Aaron.
4079760	4081760	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
4094760	4095760	Hello.
4095760	4096760	Hello.
4096760	4100760	Aaron is the reason why we watch your show in bed with our dogs, our many dogs.
4100760	4103760	We have a very specific fetish.
4104760	4105760	It was just outlined.
4105760	4106760	That's a really specific one.
4106760	4107760	It is.
4107760	4111760	Curtis, I heard that not all of your summers have been sane.
4112760	4113760	Curtis was in one crazy summer.
4113760	4114760	Did you guys bring that up already?
4114760	4115760	Yeah, we did actually.
4115760	4116760	Oh, I'm so sorry.
4116760	4117760	We talked about that, but that's all right.
4117760	4118760	The pikey takes a long time.
4118760	4121760	It's nice to know that you were listening to the show.
4122760	4125760	Me and my best friend, Kimber, who's backstage, we got some burgers.
4125760	4127760	We ordered them at some boogers.
4127760	4129760	Where'd you get the burgers from?
4130760	4132760	That's what I want to know.
4133760	4136760	I don't know why in that moment I thought you were talking.
4136760	4141760	Yeah, because I can't see him, so when that voice comes out, I get confused.
4141760	4143760	It's a real layout issue.
4143760	4144760	No.
4144760	4146760	Where'd the burgers come from?
4149760	4150760	Sorry I brought it up.
4150760	4151760	It's very boring.
4151760	4155760	We ordered burgers from the pikey thinking that we would get them before eight o'clock,
4155760	4156760	and we didn't.
4156760	4158760	That's not boring at all.
4160760	4162760	That story is a rich tapestry.
4162760	4164760	That's a Navajo quilt of story.
4164760	4170760	I'm very embarrassed about my one crazy summer joke, because I was about to come out and
4170760	4172760	I'm like, they haven't even mentioned one crazy summer.
4172760	4173760	Oh, no.
4173760	4174760	We're going to be real cool.
4174760	4175760	We covered that first, actually.
4175760	4176760	Oh, boy.
4176760	4179760	Well, this is one boring spring.
4179760	4181760	This is a segment I'd like to do.
4181760	4190760	I'd like to add a segment that comes after 9-11 called Dan's Getting Tipsy.
4190760	4191760	Play the theme music.
4195760	4198760	Because this now is my favorite song of all time.
4199760	4208760	From the morning to the night, you're gonna drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, family, family.
4210760	4214760	There's always going to come a point, obviously, in the show because I drink throughout the show
4214760	4220760	and I start to lose control and start to regret.
4220760	4223760	The reason I don't listen to the show the next night.
4223760	4224760	Were you drinking before the show?
4224760	4227760	What I wanted to say is, no, I wasn't drinking.
4227760	4228760	What are you?
4228760	4229760	Dr. Drew?
4229760	4232760	I'm just saying, were you easing?
4232760	4234760	No, I was in the edit bay, but I just sit here.
4234760	4235760	It's glasses of vodka.
4235760	4238760	You sit down and you start to earn this drinking during the show.
4238760	4241760	A little buzz, and then I start to think, I just wanted to say,
4241760	4247760	Curtis, you look so great on the show, on the King of the Nerds show.
4247760	4252760	You look so activated and glowing and happy and handsome and like delivering so much.
4252760	4254760	That's why I want people to watch the show.
4254760	4257760	Yeah, because I look much better than I do here.
4257760	4263760	Spencer, my Molly just kicked in, so I want to tell you this.
4263760	4265760	There's a segment for that too.
4266760	4269760	Everyone's drugs are kicking in.
4274760	4278760	This is very dumb, but I think maybe, I'll call it 10 years ago, give or take.
4278760	4282760	I was at a Chipotle on Sunset Boulevard and you were in front of me,
4282760	4286760	and I wanted to hug you because I was like, there's Curtis, I was so happy.
4286760	4291760	And I was too shy to say hello, but I was very happy to be standing behind Curtis,
4291760	4293760	and I'm strong at the Chipotle.
4294760	4296760	I don't know what to say.
4296760	4297760	Baja Fresh.
4297760	4298760	It was a Baja Fresh.
4298760	4299760	Now, do you remember?
4299760	4300760	That track.
4300760	4302760	Oh, the Baja Fresh!
4302760	4303760	Yes!
4303760	4304760	I was the guy behind you.
4304760	4305760	You were the guy behind me that time.
4305760	4306760	I was the guy.
4306760	4307760	You know why I remember?
4307760	4308760	Yeah.
4308760	4310760	It was the only time I ever went into that place.
4310760	4311760	Yeah, exactly.
4311760	4313760	Because it's such a risky business.
4316760	4318760	That was the right response.
4318760	4320760	That was pretty crazy.
4320760	4326760	And your business doesn't have insurance on it.
4328760	4333760	It is taking certain gambles on the lawn.
4333760	4334760	Beep, beep.
4334760	4335760	Financial risk.
4335760	4337760	Everybody's going to do it.
4337760	4338760	Risky business.
4338760	4344760	Yeah, Curtis, you're so joyful on that show and you clearly are super into it.
4344760	4348760	Has anybody brought up your rap, your TBS rap?
4348760	4349760	My rap?
4349760	4350760	No, no one brought it up.
4350760	4351760	You have a rap?
4351760	4353760	Yeah, I think it's called On Fridays.
4353760	4355760	Well, I don't know.
4355760	4356760	I'm not sure what it was called.
4356760	4358760	Is anybody familiar with Curtis's rap?
4358760	4359760	I'm going to try to do it.
4359760	4360760	No, he probably is.
4360760	4363760	No, you know what?
4363760	4364760	King of the Nerds.
4364760	4366760	It was the King of the Nerds on Friday.
4366760	4369760	TBS on Friday.
4369760	4370760	Nine o'clock.
4370760	4372760	The King of the Nerds.
4372760	4373760	The King of the Nerds.
4373760	4375760	The King of the Nerds.
4375760	4377760	The Nerds is back.
4377760	4380760	In the nerdiest nerd town.
4380760	4383760	No Nerds, new night, new Nerds, intact.
4383760	4386760	The ultimate Nerds is the ultimate showdown.
4386760	4389760	Battle it out for the ultimate nerd crown.
4389760	4392760	King of the Nerds.
4392760	4393760	Something like that.
4393760	4395760	Hashtag something.
4395760	4398760	Hashtag Nerds rule.
4398760	4401760	Wish you would have known back in high school.
4401760	4402760	Yeah.
4402760	4403760	Wow.
4403760	4406760	I kind of feel bad that MC...
4406760	4409760	MC John didn't sit in on that one.
4409760	4410760	Yeah.
4410760	4411760	No, that...
4411760	4414760	Dan has a new rap character that...
4414760	4418760	And I'm expecting, you know, Kanye to come out here any second.
4418760	4422760	Also, Curtis, you've been...
4422760	4426760	You've exposed a lot of skin this season.
4426760	4427760	How do you feel about that?
4427760	4428760	I got naked.
4428760	4430760	Was that your pitch or was that...
4430760	4431760	What was the...?
4431760	4434760	Yeah, it was the only time I've ever actually appeared
4434760	4437760	in front of people without any clothes on.
4437760	4439760	So we had a theory about that.
4439760	4440760	What was it?
4440760	4442760	So you're E.P.ing the show with Carradine.
4442760	4443760	Yeah.
4443760	4444760	He seems a little...
4444760	4447760	Like, can we talk about Bobby?
4447760	4448760	He...
4448760	4449760	Like, does he seem...
4449760	4450760	Can we talk about Bobby?
4450760	4452760	He seems less invested in the show than you.
4452760	4453760	Oh, no, no, no, not at all.
4453760	4454760	No, he's absolutely...
4454760	4455760	It's just...
4455760	4457760	I mean, you know, you have two people.
4457760	4459760	If we were both doing exactly the same thing, that would be...
4459760	4460760	Right.
4460760	4461760	Oh, so he...
4461760	4463760	He does what he does, and then I do what I do.
4463760	4465760	You're gonna get naked, and you're like, yeah, I'll get naked.
4465760	4466760	Yeah, no, no.
4466760	4467760	We just...
4467760	4468760	We had to get naked because...
4468760	4473760	I had to get naked because I will do anything.
4473760	4475760	And they were trying to figure out...
4475760	4476760	What time are you?
4476760	4479760	Well, I mean, within limits.
4479760	4480760	Cool it.
4480760	4481760	But they were...
4481760	4482760	They...
4482760	4484760	We needed to explain why...
4484760	4486760	This is so stupid, but we...
4486760	4491760	It was actually just because we needed to explain why the nerds were not going to pick their teams this year.
4491760	4492760	I mean, you didn't have to do it.
4492760	4493760	Somebody said...
4493760	4494760	It's great.
4494760	4495760	But it's...
4495760	4496760	Somebody said...
4496760	4502760	One of the showrunners said, what about if we do Terminator and you show up naked from
4502760	4507760	the future to explain why the nerds can't do this?
4507760	4509760	So I said, great!
4509760	4510760	It was fantastic.
4510760	4511760	Yeah.
4511760	4512760	It was a great idea.
4512760	4515760	I was worried it was not going to pay off until the end of the season, that you guys
4515760	4517760	were trying to do, like, a seasonal thing.
4517760	4518760	Like, this was the season when...
4518760	4519760	Well, we've done it now.
4519760	4523760	We did it, you know, after the first season, we came back with an explanation that we
4523760	4525760	have to figure out why the king is dead.
4525760	4526760	No, you don't.
4526760	4527760	You don't.
4527760	4528760	No, we do.
4528760	4529760	But it's very nerdy of you to do it.
4529760	4530760	But that's a satisfied thing about the show.
4530760	4531760	You do that.
4531760	4532760	You don't have to do it.
4532760	4533760	It's true.
4533760	4534760	The Bachelor never says, like...
4534760	4535760	No.
4535760	4537760	We ran out of roses on the first season.
4537760	4539760	We gave them all away.
4539760	4540760	Yeah.
4540760	4541760	We had to put them down.
4541760	4542760	That's why we're different.
4542760	4544760	But I guess they're not saying it's the king of married people on that show.
4544760	4547760	Like, they're just saying, you two are married, fuck off.
4547760	4548760	And you're saying it's the king of the nerds.
4548760	4549760	No, I love that.
4549760	4550760	I like that.
4550760	4553760	Each season begins with the reason why the king of the nerds is now gone and there needs
4553760	4554760	to be a new king.
4554760	4555760	So we have to get a new king.
4555760	4556760	And it has to...
4556760	4558760	You know, it's a science fiction thing or a fantasy one.
4558760	4563760	With those bits, like, this is the third season, have there been any that you've regretted?
4563760	4565760	Oh, you mean nerds?
4565760	4567760	Oh, well, sure.
4567760	4570760	No, no, your bit's like the Terminator bit.
4570760	4571760	Oh, no, no, no.
4571760	4572760	I don't regret anything.
4572760	4573760	Oh, that's good.
4573760	4574760	But you've regretted some of the nerds?
4574760	4575760	No, no, no.
4575760	4576760	I don't regret them either.
4576760	4581640	But if that's what you were going to ask, I was going to say, no, I don't have any regrets
4581640	4582640	about the nerds.
4582640	4584960	And I have no regrets about anything I've ever done.
4584960	4588160	Do you have any regrets in life?
4588160	4590760	He just said, no, you fucking asshole.
4590760	4591760	Well, no.
4591760	4593600	He's talking about the shot, guys.
4593600	4594600	Wait a minute.
4594600	4596360	He was asking about life.
4596360	4598960	I was saying that I don't have any regrets about my career.
4598960	4599960	Oh, okay.
4599960	4600960	I mean, you know.
4600960	4601960	I just thought he should regret that question.
4601960	4602960	Well, I mean, he...
4602960	4603960	Yeah.
4604160	4606160	I, like you, regret nothing.
4606160	4607160	What?
4607160	4608160	No, I'm kidding.
4608160	4609160	I regret nothing.
4609160	4610160	I don't regret asking that question.
4610160	4611160	Fuck you.
4611160	4612160	Yeah.
4612160	4613160	All right.
4613160	4614660	Now, do you regret saying bullshit?
4614660	4615660	No.
4615660	4621160	Let's not acknowledge this asshole that keeps on talking in the audience.
4621160	4623560	Who got away?
4623560	4625960	Did you ever have any romances with any co-stars?
4625960	4626960	What?
4626960	4627960	On the...
4627960	4628960	You have to be more specific.
4628960	4629960	Oh.
4629960	4630960	You mean...
4630960	4631960	I mean, in your...
4631960	4632960	On the nerds?
4632960	4636960	I mean, if you're wearing that Dickensian cap, I'm better off dead, or...
4636960	4638960	Oh, my little top hat.
4638960	4640960	Oh, that was a big top hat, Curtis.
4640960	4641960	Have I never...
4641960	4645960	Have I ever had romances on jobs, you mean?
4645960	4646960	Yes.
4646960	4647960	Well, of course.
4649960	4651960	Was that cool?
4654960	4655960	At the time.
4655960	4658960	You don't have to say whom, but is there anyone that's like a very...
4658960	4661960	Like a Diane Keaton, where you're like, I know what it looks like.
4661960	4662960	Like, is there...
4662960	4664960	Is there any...
4666960	4667960	No.
4667960	4668960	No, there's nothing like that.
4668960	4669960	Nothing like that.
4669960	4670960	It could be anything.
4671960	4674960	Curtis, do you know what Diane Keaton's vag looks like?
4675960	4678960	It has a very tasteful vest.
4685960	4688960	You're saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Annie Hall?
4688960	4692960	I'm saying Diane Keaton's vagina dresses up like Diane Keaton, who dresses up like Annie Hall.
4692960	4694960	She's not always in a vest.
4694960	4696960	No, she's not, but that...
4697960	4698960	King of the nerds!
4698960	4699960	King of the nerds!
4699960	4700960	King of the nerds!
4700960	4702960	King of the nerds on Fridays!
4702960	4703960	All right.
4703960	4704960	All right.
4704960	4708960	So, thanks for doing that, because it gives me a chance to say it's on Fridays.
4708960	4710960	And, you know, we're still running at this point.
4710960	4712960	And it's doing well in the ratings now.
4712960	4713960	It's doing well in the ratings.
4713960	4714960	Yeah.
4714960	4715960	Which is a relief.
4715960	4716960	It is, for me.
4716960	4717960	Because it's on TBS.
4717960	4718960	And you can't tell.
4718960	4720960	I don't know from what I'm watching the show.
4720960	4724960	Usually in the old days in TV, you'd go like, well, obviously, Manimal is killing.
4725960	4728960	Because now the peacock has a fin on it.
4728960	4730960	Because it turns into a shark.
4731960	4733960	Wait, are you joking about that?
4733960	4736960	Did Manimal morph the peacock into other animals?
4736960	4737960	No.
4737960	4738960	God damn, that would be great.
4738960	4739960	No, because Manimal never killed.
4739960	4740960	I used to...
4740960	4742960	Do you ever pretend to be Manimal?
4742960	4745960	I would do a thing where I'd put my hand on my desk and make my finger pulse.
4745960	4747960	Remember when Manimal was like, is this kind of...
4747960	4748960	Yeah.
4748960	4749960	Is this going to hand and puff out?
4749960	4752960	I had a Manimal trick when I was a kid.
4753960	4757960	Jack Black, I think I've told this on the show.
4757960	4761960	Jack Black, when we were doing Heat Vision and Jack, we were swapping stories about, like,
4761960	4763960	the influence of Six Million Dollar Man.
4763960	4766960	And he said that he would, yeah, he would go to school.
4766960	4769960	I just talked about this, didn't I, on this podcast?
4769960	4773960	When he was in sixth grade, because he loved Six Million Dollar Man so much,
4773960	4778960	he would sometimes tuck wires, electrical wires, into his sleeve and go to class
4778960	4784960	and wait in his peripheral vision for another kid to, like, possibly see the wires,
4784960	4788960	but not look at the kid and just, like, hide the wires.
4789960	4791960	Because he was that into, you know...
4791960	4792960	That's great.
4792960	4794960	He wanted to be a secret robot.
4795960	4796960	Wow.
4797960	4798960	That's such a...
4798960	4799960	I did something like that.
4799960	4801960	Do you want to hear what mine was?
4801960	4802960	Uh-huh.
4802960	4806960	I wasn't into Six Million Dollar Man, but I just wasn't okay.
4806960	4807960	Did you pretend to be...
4807960	4810960	Was that that same guy who keeps asking questions?
4810960	4812960	Okay, I didn't like it, okay?
4812960	4816960	But what I did, I loved Sherlock Holmes, though.
4816960	4818960	I was really into Sherlock Holmes.
4818960	4819960	Like, in what incarnation?
4819960	4820960	Just the books.
4820960	4821960	Wow.
4821960	4822960	A real nerd.
4822960	4823960	Yeah.
4823960	4830960	And my bedroom overlooked the street outside my parents' house,
4830960	4835960	and so what I would do, because I couldn't get dates and I had no friends,
4835960	4840960	so I would lower my shade and light myself from behind,
4840960	4844960	and then this friend of mine had given me...
4844960	4845960	No.
4845960	4847960	Stop, let me finish.
4847960	4850960	I know where you're headed, Curtis.
4850960	4855960	...had given me a violin, which had no strings,
4855960	4863960	and I would stand in front of the shade and pretend to play the violin...
4863960	4864960	That's called home-alone-ing.
4864960	4868960	...hoping somebody would walk by and go,
4868960	4871960	boy, he's really more interesting than I thought.
4871960	4873960	Oh!
4873960	4876960	That is.
4876960	4877960	That's great.
4877960	4878960	I actually did that.
4878960	4881960	Was that based on an image that was described by Conan Doyle?
4881960	4882960	Yes.
4882960	4883960	Conan Doyle?
4883960	4886960	Yeah, so he's walking, you know, that aquiline figure walking past the shade.
4886960	4890960	I would do that only because my figure was not really...
4890960	4892960	Curtis, you know how you would...
4892960	4894960	From the side, I have no no's at all.
4894960	4898960	I mean, you can see it when I'm facing you, but when you go to the side, I have no profile.
4898960	4902960	Now, when you picture Sherlock Holmes, do you picture one of the actors from the films,
4902960	4903960	or do you have your own image?
4903960	4905960	No, I picture what I saw in my head when I first read the books.
4905960	4906960	Who would that look like?
4906960	4910960	It doesn't look like anybody that is in any of the movies.
4910960	4911960	That's a great way to read.
4911960	4912960	John Cusack.
4912960	4913960	John Cusack, right.
4913960	4914960	John Cusack?
4914960	4915960	Yeah.
4915960	4916960	Yeah.
4916960	4923760	When that Sherlock Holmes movie came out with Robert Downey Jr., I was amazed to see a sequence
4923760	4928160	in that movie that I had written into a script for the Heat Vision and Jack movie as a joke,
4928160	4933440	which is the idea that if you can get so intelligent that you can know how to beat somebody up.
4933440	4934440	Oh, yeah.
4934440	4938160	And I was like, that was the joke in the Heat Vision and Jack movie is that he would like
4938160	4943280	get super intelligent, and then he'd be like, you know, describing with diagrams the way
4943280	4945040	that he would punch people.
4945040	4950080	And it's like, and then they did it for real, and they made a lot of money.
4950080	4951080	Nobody cared.
4951080	4952080	Nobody laughed.
4952080	4953080	Everyone just went, here's my money.
4953080	4956440	I love that he's so smart, he can beat you up.
4956440	4958400	Oh, man.
4958400	4959960	Yeah.
4959960	4966120	I was introduced to Revenge of the Nerds as a camp counselor.
4966120	4973160	I had to chaperone a bus of a bunch of kids going to compete in a like soccer game and
4973160	4977320	like all these sports competition, even though I wasn't a sports counselor.
4977320	4981960	And the most jockey, most handsome counselor was like, I got to show you guys this movie
4981960	4984520	because we got to watch movies on the buses.
4984520	4988440	So this other counselor played Revenge of the Nerds, and it was such a crisis of self as
4988440	4992640	like an uncomfortable teenager, like all these jocks laughing at it, and the entire time
4992640	4993640	I was like, what?
4993640	4994640	Explain to me what's funny.
4995160	4999360	Is it funny because you're laughing at them, or like you feel nerdy inside, or what's happening?
4999360	5002080	It was just like, it was just a strange.
5002080	5005920	I remember that too, like all the kids were kind of like laughing, like they were like,
5005920	5007640	they weren't nerds, but they loved that movie.
5007640	5008640	They were like laughing.
5008640	5012240	The funny thing is I over the years, I get approached by people all the time, guys on
5012240	5016560	the street will come up to me, and they are clearly jocks.
5016560	5018360	I mean, they've got no neck.
5018360	5022640	They've got buzz cuts and all this and the muscles and everything.
5022720	5024960	I mean, they're ridiculous.
5024960	5032160	They look so jocky, and they will come up to me and say, Revenge of the Nerds, right?
5032160	5034920	I go, yeah, yeah.
5034920	5037560	That movie meant a lot to me.
5037560	5039800	That was what my life was.
5039800	5042880	And I'm saying, thank you, thank you, that's very nice of you.
5042880	5047520	And inside I'm going, fuck you.
5047520	5050640	You beat up people like me.
5050640	5055080	But then I started thinking over time, I was going, you know what?
5055080	5059040	Even within the jock world, there's a pecking order.
5059040	5063240	And it's possible that the guy that I'm talking to was the guy who they called Tiny.
5063240	5064240	That's the thing.
5064240	5070320	I remember doing stand up in Michigan, and it was like talking to these motorcycle guys.
5070320	5073760	They were all super intimidating, and it was like trying to intimidate me.
5073760	5077640	And then there was this one guy, and they kept calling him Cage, and they're like, there's
5077640	5078640	Cage.
5078960	5082880	You get the drinks, and Cage is like, all right.
5082880	5089880	And then throughout the night, Cage was more available to me, so Cage, what's it like with
5089880	5090880	this motorcycle group?
5090880	5093960	And he's like, well, they do this, and they're like, hey, Cage, come on.
5093960	5094960	And he's like, fine.
5094960	5099120	And then they started laughing, and they're like, you don't like being called Cage, do
5099120	5100120	you?
5100120	5102560	And he's like, no, I don't.
5102560	5105000	And I was like, why don't you like being called Cage?
5105000	5106000	And he's like, badass.
5106000	5108960	And he's like, Cage is what you call a car.
5108960	5110920	I can't drive a motorcycle anymore.
5110920	5112520	I drive a car.
5112520	5120000	He was, they call it, they call cars Cages, because they're free.
5120000	5122760	Wait, wait, wait.
5122760	5126280	He thought that because they called him Cage, he wasn't allowed to drive a motorcycle?
5126280	5127280	No, no, no.
5127280	5129360	They called him, they were teasing him.
5129360	5130360	His name wasn't even Cage.
5130360	5132360	Had he lost his motor fucking license?
5132360	5134360	Yeah, like he, something had happened.
5134520	5136520	And he couldn't drive the motorcycle.
5136520	5140000	And so they were calling him, like, you know, the equivalent of calling him, like, Lefty,
5140000	5141000	because he lost his right hand.
5141000	5142000	Right.
5142000	5143000	He should have taken himself so seriously.
5143000	5146000	Hey, Chef, the point being that, that, that, that, that's the same thing.
5146000	5147000	No, sure.
5147000	5151520	Well, and everybody, it's very rare for, like, a cool jock to actually feel cool, the people
5151520	5152520	that we think feel cool.
5152520	5156640	Or it's all a continuum, and that the point is that everywhere you go, like, there is
5156640	5157640	no such thing.
5157640	5161680	That's why the nerd movement, eventually, the nerd movement, they're like, yeah, once
5161680	5166640	we started calling, gave a name to feeling like the other, it was only a matter of time
5166640	5170600	before that would be mainstream, because everyone feels like the other.
5170600	5174560	There's no one that you've talked to, you go to your 20-year high school reunion, nobody
5174560	5181600	is self-identifies as normal, nobody, like, there's a bunch of people that you thought
5181600	5186320	picked on you, and that were all, all represented, the normal people, and within them, they were
5186320	5191040	chewing each other to pieces, which is what we learned from Molly Ringwald and Breakfast
5191040	5192040	Club.
5192040	5196960	There's also a pride in what, you know, I guess in the nerd community, is that it does worship
5196960	5200040	intelligence, it worships, like, knowledge, like, information.
5200040	5201680	It worships efficacy, yeah, it's like...
5201680	5202680	Well, and it's obsession.
5202680	5210800	I mean, it's obsession, you acquire, even if you're not a PhD, you've acquired vast
5210800	5213360	amounts of knowledge about whatever you are interested in.
5213360	5214360	About at least one specific thing.
5214360	5218120	So, when you were saying something about the, you know, what's the comic book guy doing
5218120	5222480	on, you know, when you've got PhDs, well, you know, the comic book guy, if you get
5222480	5228600	him into a room with a PhD, is going to be able to whoop the PhD on comic book information,
5228600	5232280	so that makes that person intelligent in that way.
5232280	5237000	And that's, everybody's got, you know, their thing, and when they, when nerds become obsessive
5237000	5242000	about something, they become brilliant.
5242000	5243000	Have you ever played any...
5243000	5244520	Should I have stopped talking a while now?
5244520	5246000	Am I still talking?
5246520	5248760	Curtis, have you ever played any role-playing games?
5251560	5253040	You ask such interesting questions.
5253040	5254040	She doesn't mean sexually.
5254040	5256440	She means, like, D&D.
5256440	5257440	I'm not sure now.
5257440	5258440	She doesn't mean...
5258440	5261400	Have you ever broken in as a sexy burglar?
5261400	5266560	Every question she's asked me, I've had to have a follow-up, because I'm not sure how
5266560	5267560	to answer them.
5267560	5268560	Role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons?
5268560	5269560	No.
5269560	5273040	Well, you're gonna...
5273040	5274840	You're about to, right now.
5274840	5277320	You're about to play a game called Shadowrun.
5277320	5278320	Okay.
5278320	5284400	All right, so Spencer is our game master.
5284400	5289880	Can I just ask, so earlier when you said, do I have a hard out?
5289880	5290880	You said no.
5290880	5291880	And I said no.
5291880	5292880	I remember that.
5292880	5295520	If I had said yes, then I wouldn't have had this happen.
5295520	5297120	You were answering this question, yeah.
5297120	5298120	Okay.
5298120	5299120	You would be gone right now.
5299120	5301120	I'd be home by now.
5301120	5304120	I like that you thought I just asked you if you role-play.
5304880	5305880	Well, you...
5305880	5307320	Curtis, do you role-play?
5307320	5310560	You said, do you play role-playing games?
5310560	5313080	Also, you asked him if he had sex with women.
5313080	5314080	Yeah, that's right.
5314080	5315480	I have put myself into this.
5315480	5318720	So you have asked a couple of questionable questions.
5318720	5319720	That's true.
5319720	5320720	But you've been talking.
5320720	5321720	Wait a minute.
5321720	5324720	You know what?
5324720	5327920	If this means I have to read something, you may be out of luck, pal.
5327920	5328920	Oh, oh, well, yeah.
5328920	5329920	Oh, no.
5329920	5330920	I can probably read this.
5330920	5331920	Well, you need glasses or...
5331920	5332920	Yeah.
5333720	5334720	I mean, I never know what's going on on these pages.
5334720	5335720	All right.
5335720	5336720	You can fake it.
5336720	5337720	I mean...
5337720	5339720	I don't know if I can fake it.
5339720	5342720	I may have to have somebody get my glasses from the other room.
5342720	5343720	Oh, that's easy.
5343720	5344720	Can you do that?
5344720	5345720	We have all kinds of...
5345720	5346720	Can you have somebody do that?
5346720	5347720	I'll find them.
5347720	5348720	They're in my coat.
5348720	5349720	They're in my coat.
5349720	5350720	They're in his coat.
5350720	5353720	Is there anything else in your coat I should know about before I go through your coat?
5353720	5357720	No, and there better not be anything in my coat when I put it on later.
5358720	5361720	I'm not...
5361720	5363720	I'm not gross.
5371720	5373720	See, this coat is called children's porn.
5373720	5375720	So, wait a minute.
5375720	5378720	Not porn of children, but porn that's owned by children.
5381720	5383720	Porn that children would make if they...
5383720	5385720	If you said, hey, make a porn movie.
5385720	5386720	It's like a crayon and a donut.
5387720	5390720	And they just go down a slide together.
5394720	5396720	New zine idea.
5396720	5397720	Thank you.
5400720	5402720	It's just...
5402720	5405720	Your character has been handed to you.
5405720	5410720	It's a lot of little scrawly writing, little statistics and things.
5410720	5415720	They won't come into play unless you're asked.
5416720	5424720	Essentially, what it is, it's improvised storytelling with Spencer is the one that's in control of anything that happens.
5424720	5425720	Because he's the game master.
5425720	5428720	So, he's telling us what's happening, but each of us is a character.
5428720	5434720	And there's no high pressure to it because it's kind of turn-based and you're not like...
5434720	5435720	That's taped.
5435720	5442720	So, he's letting us know what's going on and then there's a point where we can do something.
5442720	5444720	You can say, oh, I see.
5444720	5450720	I walk up the street or I go over to the vending machine and I punch it or whatever you want to do.
5450720	5455720	And then Spencer, who's the referee and who understands the rules of the game, he might say to you, what's your agility?
5455720	5458720	And it's okay that it takes a half hour for you to go.
5458720	5462720	It's three because you find it somewhere on the sheet and you go, it's three.
5462720	5465720	And that's basically how it goes.
5465720	5466720	Your agility.
5466720	5468720	That's an example, yeah.
5468720	5472720	That's the question that's often asked me that I never have the answer to immediately.
5472720	5473720	Okay.
5473720	5476720	So, in brief, like broad strokes, you're playing...
5476720	5477720	You mean attribute.
5477720	5478720	Yes.
5478720	5479720	Your attribute.
5479720	5482720	You said agility, but you meant attribute.
5482720	5483720	Well, I was using...
5483720	5486720	I was riffing an example, yes, of an attribute.
5486720	5487720	Agility, for instance.
5487720	5488720	Yes, I was...
5488720	5489720	I'm not stupid.
5489720	5490720	I was looking for...
5490720	5492720	I'm not gross and he's not stupid.
5492720	5496720	I was looking for agility, the list of possible things for agility.
5496720	5499720	And there's no agility, there's attributes.
5499720	5501720	There's attributes and then one of the attributes is agility.
5501720	5502720	I was just...
5502720	5503720	It's an example.
5503720	5505720	The second attribute down is agility.
5505720	5508720	Oh, agility, yeah.
5508720	5511720	I've never thought of...
5511720	5512720	Agility as an attribute?
5512720	5513720	Agility as an app you do.
5513720	5514720	All right, never mind.
5514720	5515720	Okay.
5515720	5520720	All right, so Spencer, do you want to briefly fill Curtis in on what Kumail, what his character
5520720	5521720	is for the evening?
5521720	5523720	Your character's a doctor.
5523720	5524720	He has a gun.
5524720	5526720	He could heal people.
5526720	5528720	Did you say he has a gun?
5528720	5529720	Yeah, like...
5529720	5530720	Okay.
5530720	5533720	He's a doctor.
5533720	5534720	Stupid me.
5534720	5535720	I'm sorry.
5535720	5537720	You guys are criminals?
5537720	5538720	He has a gun.
5538720	5541720	Thou might do some harm.
5541720	5543720	Right, exactly.
5543720	5544720	Okay.
5544720	5545720	Yeah, you guys are criminals.
5545720	5548720	You do missions for, you know, criminal employers.
5548720	5551720	Oh, so not a medical doctor.
5551720	5556720	He's like a doctor, like Dr. Evil.
5556720	5558720	He's a doctor like a military doctor.
5558720	5559720	You're like a street doctor.
5559720	5562720	You work with criminals, and when criminals need medical help, you're the one that comes
5562720	5563720	and passes and stuff.
5563720	5564720	Oh, I'm the guy.
5564720	5565720	Oh, I'm that guy.
5565720	5566720	You're like a mob doctor.
5566720	5567720	Okay, I'm the mob doctor.
5567720	5568720	And it's the future.
5568720	5569720	We're kind of like the A-Team.
5569720	5570720	The future.
5570720	5573720	This is like 70 years in the future or so, and we're kind of like the A-Team.
5573720	5576720	We're a bunch of specialists in certain ways.
5576720	5577720	Dan's very strong.
5577720	5582720	Aaron's very charming and charismatic and can talk away in and out of situations.
5582720	5585720	I'm a magic user, so I can cast spells and shit like that.
5585720	5591720	So right now, we're looking for a guy named Baldwin Brown, if I'm not mistaken.
5591720	5592720	Yeah.
5592720	5596720	And we're trying to capture this guy and bring him back to our contact.
5596720	5601720	So Spencer, if you would, why don't you give us the brief how-do-you-do's and catch us
5601720	5603720	up to date, please.
5603720	5606720	All right.
5606720	5611720	Last time on Shadowrun.
5612720	5618720	Our heroes were in the warehouse looking for Baldwin Brown, but he was nowhere to be found.
5618720	5624720	So together, our heroes tased a bunch of junkies and then slapped them awake and then asked
5624720	5629720	them questions and then shoved RFID tags into their stomachs.
5629720	5638720	Eve sent off a hawk spirit to find Baldwin, but he would not return in some time.
5638720	5645720	Together, the heroes gathered up the illicit merchandise and headed off towards the neutral
5645720	5648720	drop zone.
5648720	5649720	That's all.
5649720	5650720	All clear.
5650720	5653720	Thank you, Spencer.
5653720	5654720	Yep.
5654720	5658720	So pretty cut and dry there.
5658720	5660720	I can't remember.
5660720	5661720	We took a truck, right?
5661720	5664720	The ladies are driving and the fellas are in the back.
5664720	5666720	Portagard's driving.
5667720	5669720	And we're meeting up with our Johnson.
5669720	5670720	Yeah.
5670720	5673720	And Curtis' character, the Doctor, we haven't encountered him yet, right?
5673720	5675720	Oh, he's been there.
5675720	5676720	Oh, sorry.
5676720	5677720	Yeah, you have been there.
5677720	5682720	So we don't have Portagard, and so I'm in the back of the truck with you, Jim Nightblade,
5682720	5683720	who is Dan.
5683720	5686720	And Doctor Friend.
5686720	5687720	Doctor Friend.
5687720	5688720	Doctor Friend?
5688720	5691720	Doctor Friend, probably up in the front maybe with Mercy, right?
5691720	5693720	Wherever he wants to be, man.
5693720	5694720	Well, which is it?
5694720	5695720	What part of the truck?
5695720	5698720	Do you want to be in the back of the semi?
5698720	5699720	No, I want to be shotgun.
5699720	5700720	Okay, you're shotgun.
5700720	5702720	I mean, it seems appropriate.
5702720	5706720	What's your agility?
5706720	5708720	My agility is four.
5708720	5709720	All right, just checking.
5709720	5710720	Just checking.
5710720	5711720	That's good.
5711720	5716720	That's a good time.
5716720	5718720	All right, so where...
5718720	5721720	And that's four out of ten?
5721720	5724720	I think it maxed out like 15 or something.
5724720	5725720	Like 16.
5725720	5727720	I should be more than four then.
5727720	5728720	But anyway.
5728720	5729720	We're just starting out.
5729720	5731720	It's your game.
5731720	5733720	Now, you're a troll also.
5733720	5734720	You're not like a human.
5734720	5735720	You're a troll.
5735720	5737720	Of course.
5737720	5739720	I should have mentioned that.
5739720	5741720	A Dr. Gangster troll.
5741720	5743720	Yeah.
5743720	5744720	Okay.
5744720	5747720	It sounds like a Curtis Armstrong part, actually.
5747720	5753720	All right, through my comm link, we can all communicate to each other through comm links.
5753720	5754720	I say to Mercy.
5754720	5756720	Mercy, where are we headed?
5756720	5759720	We're going to the Johnson, right?
5759720	5760720	Yeah.
5760720	5761720	All right.
5761720	5762720	Sweet.
5762720	5763720	We're going to the Johnson.
5763720	5767720	I still have this photograph of Brian.
5767720	5768720	Baldwin.
5768720	5769720	Baldwin.
5769720	5773720	Of Baldwin standing in front of a bathroom, so I'm looking at that.
5773720	5775720	We're headed to the Johnson.
5775720	5778720	I don't like any of it.
5778720	5782720	You've been a problem this whole time, friend.
5782720	5785720	I can't go against my training.
5785720	5786720	Okay, friend.
5786720	5792720	I've been trying to help as much as I can, but I have to remember I am a doctor.
5792720	5795720	All right.
5795720	5799720	Respect your integrity.
5799720	5801720	It's not integrity.
5801720	5803720	I've sold myself.
5803720	5811720	I've sold myself to you people.
5811720	5821720	And if it wasn't for him knowing what he knows, I'd walk away from all of this.
5821720	5822720	Hey, Nightblade.
5822720	5824720	Yeah, what the fuck's going on, Nightblade?
5824720	5826720	What do you got in this guy?
5826720	5827720	What are you holding over his head?
5827720	5828720	What are you talking about?
5828720	5831720	We're a crew, Nightblade.
5831720	5834720	I don't want any blackmail happening behind our backs.
5834720	5835720	This has got to be about trust.
5835720	5836720	It's not about blackmail.
5836720	5840720	It's about friendship and trust, something you guys wouldn't know about.
5840720	5844720	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
5844720	5847720	Ask a friend.
5847720	5852720	All right, Doctor, why don't you patch up your relationship while we get to the job.
5852720	5854720	Listen, Doctor, I'll tell you one thing right now.
5854720	5856720	Life on the sprawl is all about secrets.
5856720	5857720	It's all about selling yourself.
5857720	5861720	If we had our way, we wouldn't be committing crimes for a living, believe me.
5861720	5862720	You know, I could always tell.
5862720	5868720	You're different from them.
5868720	5869720	You are.
5869720	5872720	You don't have to be here.
5872720	5873720	I don't want...
5873720	5875720	You could do better than this.
5875720	5879720	I'm a magic elf that is trained to use magic by Native Americans.
5879720	5881720	Oh, come on, man.
5881720	5882720	I'm a girl.
5882720	5883720	I'm a girl.
5883720	5884720	I'm a girl.
5884720	5885720	Magic female elf.
5885720	5887720	Woman, for God's sake.
5887720	5889720	You're more than that.
5889720	5890720	What am I supposed to do?
5890720	5893720	Just go back and hide in the woods and do what?
5893720	5894720	I've got to make a living somehow.
5894720	5895720	Shh, shh.
5895720	5896720	They're coming.
5896720	5897720	Doctor, Doctor, who's coming?
5897720	5898720	Who's coming?
5898720	5899720	Doctor, who's coming?
5899720	5900720	Pull over the car!
5900720	5901720	Pull over the car!
5901720	5902720	We pull...
5902720	5903720	Can we pull over the car?
5903720	5904720	Yeah, Hordegard.
5904720	5905720	I'm not driving.
5905720	5906720	You're going to have to pull over the car.
5906720	5907720	Stop.
5907720	5908720	Hordegard does that.
5908720	5909720	Hordegard's driving.
5909720	5910720	Oh, I'm sorry.
5910720	5911720	He sure is.
5911720	5912720	Okay.
5912720	5913720	Okay.
5913720	5914720	I'm sorry.
5914720	5915720	Hey, Doctor, real quick.
5915720	5916720	Yeah.
5916720	5917720	I'm not going to forget what you said.
5917720	5918720	No, we'll have to talk later.
5918720	5919720	Okay.
5920720	5921720	We can all hear you.
5921720	5922720	I pulled over the car so you could talk privately, but I guess it doesn't matter.
5922720	5923720	Let's get back on the road.
5923720	5924720	Okay?
5924720	5925720	Let's put it...
5925720	5926720	You just had us pull over.
5926720	5927720	I know, I know, I know.
5927720	5928720	I'm flustered.
5928720	5929720	We'd get there faster if we didn't keep pulling over.
5929720	5930720	I'll just say that.
5930720	5931720	Well, he said they're coming.
5931720	5932720	Who's coming?
5932720	5933720	And I guess it doesn't make sense that I pulled over if someone's coming.
5933720	5934720	Yeah.
5934720	5935720	I'm sorry.
5935720	5936720	I'm sorry.
5936720	5937720	I'm sorry.
5937720	5938720	I'm sorry.
5938720	5939720	I'm sorry.
5939720	5940720	I'm sorry.
5940720	5941720	I'm sorry.
5941720	5942720	I'm sorry.
5942720	5943720	I'm sorry.
5943720	5944720	I'm sorry.
5944720	5945720	I'm sorry.
5946720	5949720	And I guess it doesn't make sense that I pulled over if someone's coming.
5950720	5951720	They're coming.
5951720	5952720	Let's meet them.
5954720	5955720	They seem nice.
5956720	5957720	Okay.
5957720	5958720	Let's put a pin in this.
5958720	5960720	I don't want to invalidate your feelings.
5960720	5964220	I will tell you the thing that I know about this guy that I have over him.
5964220	5968720	He thinks they're coming a lot, even when they're not.
5969720	5970720	All right.
5970720	5971720	That's right.
5971720	5972720	What's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?
5972720	5973720	Yeah.
5973720	5974720	What's our ETA to the Johnson hookup?
5974720	5977720	Once we get back on the road, it'll just be a couple minutes.
5977720	5978720	Okay.
5978720	5979720	Let's drive again.
5979720	5980720	Okay.
5980720	5981720	No, we were driving.
5981720	5982720	You just had us pull out.
5982720	5983720	I know.
5984720	5985720	Never pull out.
5986720	5987720	You know.
5988720	5989720	Are they coming again?
5989720	5990720	No.
5991720	6003060	The problem is that my thing about them coming, I lost a patient because I was thinking about
6003060	6004060	them coming.
6005060	6006060	All right.
6006060	6007060	Let's pull over.
6007060	6009060	And that's why we have to work with these people.
6009060	6011060	Can we just get to the thing?
6012060	6013060	Can we just have one?
6013060	6020060	Dr. Fred has said nothing for hours and he waits until a crucial moment to bring up past
6020060	6021060	issues.
6021060	6022060	And I feel like we should deal with this.
6022060	6023060	Okay.
6023060	6024060	Here we are.
6024060	6026060	We're pulling up in front of the Johnson.
6027060	6033060	So you enter the parking lot, which is the location of the neutral drop zone.
6033060	6037060	It's a fenced off affair squished between a number of low buildings.
6037060	6041060	The fence is covered in chains, but it stands wide open.
6041060	6046060	Cars and trucks line the street outside the parking lot and broken, damaged buildings
6046060	6048060	line the sky.
6049060	6050060	I don't know.
6050060	6052060	Some of the buildings are lit up by orange light.
6052060	6056060	No one is in the lot that you can see, but it's where you're supposed to meet.
6057060	6059060	I got a bad feeling about this.
6065060	6067060	Wait, are you doing your moonlighting impression?
6067060	6068060	What is it?
6070060	6072060	I got a bad feeling about this.
6073060	6075060	Come out to the coast and have a few laughs.
6075060	6076060	All right.
6077060	6081060	Curtis, just so you know, Dan's character is strongly influenced by Bruce Willis.
6081060	6083060	Post moonlighting, Bruce Willis.
6083060	6084060	Post moonlighting, okay.
6087060	6089060	It's nighttime, right, Spencer?
6089060	6090060	Oh, yeah.
6090060	6091060	Okay.
6091060	6093060	I want to draw my weapon and get ready.
6093060	6094060	No.
6094060	6095060	What?
6095060	6096060	What?
6096060	6097060	Okay, sorry.
6099060	6103060	Jim, you always lead with force, and we don't know what's going on.
6103060	6107060	I'm getting out of a truck in an abandoned vacant lot that we've been summoned to
6107060	6111060	that's loaded with valuable goods.
6111060	6112060	All right.
6112060	6119060	Sorry, I thought I was talking to the guy who beat up a bunch of people for no reason previously.
6119060	6122060	One man's no reason, and another man's a precaution.
6124060	6125060	Yes, exactly.
6125060	6126060	Yes, precisely.
6126060	6127060	Thank you.
6128060	6129060	That is what I would say.
6132060	6135060	So I'm just saying I'm drawing my Aries predator or whatever it is,
6136060	6138060	because I'm going to get out of the trailer now.
6138060	6143060	I've been in the back of a truck, like garbage.
6144060	6145060	All right.
6145060	6150060	You hop out of the trailer in the parking lot, the location of the neutral drop zone.
6150060	6156060	You don't see anything around other than tons of cars and trucks that are just in the lot parked.
6156060	6158060	They lie still.
6158060	6160060	Is anyone playing Hordegard?
6160060	6162060	No, I am.
6162060	6163060	He's the guy we need to...
6164060	6168060	I want to know if there's people in any of these cars and trucks.
6168060	6171060	Oh, I detect a person.
6171060	6172060	Uh-oh.
6172060	6173060	Where?
6173060	6174060	There.
6174060	6177060	He points in the direction of a truck.
6178060	6180060	I'm going to put a spell on him.
6180060	6182060	I'm going to cast a spell on him.
6186060	6188060	All right, what do you want to cast?
6189060	6191060	He's now unable to do anything,
6191060	6195060	and we can take our time to figure out what our next move is.
6197060	6200060	I can do that because I see it's...
6200060	6204060	I have a level five spell casting.
6207060	6209060	And then these are your spells.
6209060	6210060	What?
6210060	6211060	These are your spells.
6211060	6212060	Oh, these are the spells.
6212060	6213060	You don't have spell making up.
6213060	6214060	Okay.
6215060	6218060	He has level three UCB spell.
6218060	6220060	Oh, these are my things.
6220060	6222060	Okay, all right, all right.
6226060	6227060	There.
6227060	6229060	I've created a dome...
6229060	6231060	or wall...
6235060	6236060	of...
6237060	6239060	magical energy.
6245060	6248060	We have to think fast.
6248060	6250060	I don't know how long I can hold it.
6251060	6254060	Doctor, what is the wall between us and what?
6254060	6257060	It's between us and him.
6257060	6258060	Okay.
6258060	6259060	Whatever he is.
6259060	6261060	All right, I run up to the hotel...
6261060	6262060	the hotel.
6262060	6264060	I run up to the wall,
6264060	6268060	and I use my perception to see if the person is a...
6268060	6270060	what their motives are.
6270060	6271060	Who is he?
6271060	6272060	What is he?
6272060	6273060	What are his motives?
6275060	6280060	This guy's a really good doctor.
6280060	6282060	He's a very good doctor.
6282060	6285060	You don't see anything beyond the wall...
6285060	6288060	other than a truck, like a semi-truck.
6288060	6290060	Oh, okay.
6294060	6296060	I'm so happy.
6300060	6303060	Where's the truck with the guys in?
6303060	6304060	I'll go check it out.
6304060	6306060	Hordegard points at it.
6306060	6308060	I walk in that direction.
6308060	6312060	As you walk, you see lights from the trucks flick on...
6312060	6314060	flanking your path,
6314060	6317060	flanking your path, lighting up the entire lot.
6317060	6321060	The truck you're walking towards with the door clicks open...
6321060	6323060	and you see a dapper figure emerge.
6323060	6326060	It's a khaki suit-wearing orc...
6326060	6329060	with a data jack in the side of his head and a monocle.
6329060	6332060	He's holding a metal briefcase.
6332060	6334060	Oh, no.
6336060	6339060	Mercy, go up there and do your thing.
6339060	6342060	Can I sprint up to where Jim is?
6342060	6343060	Yep.
6343060	6345060	I'm going to use negotiation.
6345060	6346060	All right.
6346060	6348060	Hey, handsome.
6349060	6352060	It's good to finally meet you in person.
6352060	6354060	It is great to meet you, too.
6354060	6357060	I assume that you are this Johnson we're all talking about.
6357060	6358060	Oh, yeah.
6358060	6360060	That's why we're all here, isn't it?
6360060	6362060	Yeah, it sure is.
6362060	6363060	It sure is.
6363060	6366060	Did you like my friend's wall that he made, that dome?
6366060	6370060	I got to say, it's a bit alarming.
6370060	6373060	Well, the thing that our crew does...
6373060	6376060	some crews just go around and they just talk to people...
6376060	6378060	but we show what we can do.
6378060	6381060	He's a doctor with a rich past.
6381060	6384060	Yeah, and he may also be going through a very messy divorce.
6384060	6386060	We're not sure.
6387060	6392060	So, we do not have...
6395060	6396060	Baldwin Brown.
6396060	6400060	Yeah, we do not have old baby.
6400060	6405060	And I was wondering if maybe we could have a little more time.
6405060	6407060	I do have a very good lead.
6408060	6410060	Well, what's the lead?
6410060	6415060	Well, I produce the picture.
6416060	6420060	Looks like it was just taken from his Instagram account.
6422060	6424060	Yes, here's the thing.
6424060	6426060	A lot of people wouldn't look at this.
6426060	6429060	And as we all know, there are only so many bathrooms in the city.
6431060	6435060	I think that we should have a little bit more time.
6435060	6443060	And if you need some more convincing, why don't I show you what my old friend, Dr. Friend, can do spell-wise.
6444060	6446060	Take it away, Dr. Friend.
6446060	6448060	Agony! Agony spells!
6448060	6450060	Jesus.
6450060	6454060	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6454060	6464060	Agony induces terrible pain in the target until it is deactivated.
6464060	6466060	Jesus Christ.
6467060	6469060	Somebody, somebody.
6469060	6472060	Oh, oh my God.
6472060	6475060	So the spell, there's something wrong.
6475060	6477060	It's affecting me.
6479060	6481060	He has superpowers.
6481060	6483060	I never suspected.
6484060	6486060	I use...
6487060	6491060	And the same will happen to you all if you don't return with Baldwin Brown.
6491060	6494060	Okay, that went better. He took that better than I thought he would.
6496060	6499060	Hey, listen, we got a truckload of BTL chips.
6499060	6501060	That was part of the deal.
6501060	6503060	It was $1,500 a piece or something.
6503060	6505060	No, it was not that.
6505060	6507060	It was $1,000 a piece.
6507060	6510060	$1,000 a piece? We got a truckload, so...
6511060	6515060	Yeah, at least pony up for the BTLs. We almost got killed trying to get...
6515060	6518060	All right, all right. How many boxes you got?
6518060	6520060	A million.
6521060	6524060	Oh, I'll just verify that.
6524060	6527060	He walks over to the back of the truck and starts counting.
6527060	6530060	He's like, why this? This is only 25.
6531060	6533060	I mean, that's a lot.
6533060	6535060	That's all that was there. We got them all.
6535060	6537060	We got 100% of their BTL chips.
6537060	6540060	Yeah, a million probably wouldn't fit in the truck anyway.
6540060	6542060	I don't know what I was thinking.
6542060	6544060	You're asking the wrong guy.
6544060	6551060	Also, we have, using negotiation and intimidation,
6551060	6554060	you really should give us 1,100 a box,
6554060	6557060	because there are a lot of people who want these chips.
6557060	6563060	Well, and it's really for my street clinics.
6563060	6566060	And obviously, we have no idea what he's going to do.
6568060	6572060	I mean, you have to realize, I may be working with these people,
6572060	6576060	but I still care about people who have no safety net.
6576060	6580060	And they come to my clinics on the street for help,
6580060	6588060	and these 25 boxes will just be enough to make the difference.
6590060	6594060	I'm not sure what is being expected of you.
6594060	6598060	It's being explained to you that we have a huge humanitarian incentive deal.
6600060	6602060	We need a little bit more money.
6602060	6606060	Why don't we get 1,100 a box, and we'll go and we'll get Mr. Brian.
6606060	6607060	All right, that sounds cool.
6607060	6609060	All right, thank you.
6609060	6612060	Do you know anything more about where he is?
6612060	6616060	Hey, Mercy, you guys are all forgetting that I have my eagle spirit
6616060	6618060	scouting the neighborhood right now looking for a ball of brown.
6618060	6621060	No, I remember, I remember. Do you know anything?
6621060	6628060	I'm just saying, at any moment, I go into a Native American...
6628060	6630060	Jeff, as your friend, just take a...
6630060	6632060	Salish.
6632060	6634060	I go into a shamanic trance,
6634060	6637060	and I try to communicate with my eagle spirit who's flying over the city.
6637060	6640060	Eagle, do you see ball of brown anywhere?
6640060	6643060	No, it'll take me like 20, 30 minutes.
6643060	6644060	Okay, cool.
6650060	6652060	So spiritual.
6657060	6662060	I shoot a ray of energy into the air that spells TTYL.
6663060	6665060	See ya.
6668060	6670060	No, I guess we're being a...
6670060	6672060	Our national bird.
6672060	6676060	So the Mr. Johnson, he pulls a cred stick out of his briefcase,
6676060	6678060	and he's like, this is...
6678060	6681060	What's 25 times 11?
6681060	6683060	This is that many.
6684060	6688060	That many newyuns for your troubles.
6688060	6690060	Times 100, you mean?
6690060	6691060	Yep.
6691060	6692060	Anybody?
6692060	6694060	25 times 100 is 2,500.
6694060	6696060	Don't worry about it. I'll do the math later.
6697060	6699060	He hands you the cred stick.
6699060	6701060	250, thank you.
6701060	6703060	The cred stick?
6703060	6705060	Yeah, that's like a credit card, basically.
6705060	6707060	It stores your money.
6707060	6710060	Okay, and the future has gotten longer and thinner.
6710060	6711060	Okay, sorry.
6711060	6715060	What is your problem with the cred stick concept?
6715060	6718060	You know, it's more a reflection of me.
6718060	6719060	No.
6719060	6721060	It should be smaller.
6721060	6723060	It should be smaller.
6723060	6727060	In the future, we shouldn't be advancing to bigger.
6727060	6729060	We should be shrinking.
6729060	6731060	But what if the stick does more?
6731060	6734060	Where are you going to put the stick when you go out?
6734060	6736060	You have to have a special pocket.
6736060	6737060	Exactly.
6737060	6739060	Maybe that's why they did it.
6739060	6741060	The stick is pretty small.
6741060	6743060	It's not like a giant stick.
6743060	6744060	No, I know.
6744060	6745060	Memory stick.
6745060	6746060	No, I got it.
6746060	6747060	I'm sorry.
6747060	6748060	I can't...
6748060	6750060	Curtis, this is Erin talking.
6750060	6753060	I have a hard time remembering the name for the cell phone and the money.
6753060	6755060	Ying yang.
6755060	6757060	Yeah, okay.
6757060	6758060	New yen.
6758060	6759060	New yen.
6759060	6760060	New yen.
6760060	6761060	Yeah, see?
6761060	6762060	All right.
6762060	6763060	You hear the cry of sirens.
6763060	6764060	They're close.
6764060	6765060	Too close.
6765060	6767060	It's the cops.
6767060	6769060	Jackson's like, what the hell?
6769060	6771060	They must have bugged the merchandise.
6771060	6772060	Oh, shit.
6772060	6773060	Oh, shit.
6773060	6774060	What are we going to do?
6774060	6775060	Too late.
6775060	6776060	We got to take the cred sticks and run, everybody.
6776060	6777060	Yeah, can we...
6777060	6778060	We'll be back.
6778060	6779060	We'll be back at the hangout.
6780060	6781060	You son...
6781060	6782060	Sorry.
6782060	6783060	Just you sons of bitches.
6783060	6784060	Go ahead.
6784060	6785060	Wait, what?
6785060	6786060	You're not satisfied?
6786060	6788060	Well, it sounded like you guys were running away.
6788060	6791060	We're not running away, but you can run too.
6791060	6793060	Oh, yeah.
6793060	6795060	We're not doing anything wrong to you, right?
6795060	6798060	I got a whole truckload of goods to move immediately.
6798060	6801060	It's a situation on my hands.
6801060	6804060	You want to pay us to help you with that situation?
6804060	6806060	Uh-huh.
6806060	6807060	No.
6807060	6808060	Nightblade, are you high?
6808060	6810060	He's not part of our group.
6810060	6811060	He's a customer.
6811060	6814060	He's the guy that we're going to go off and do the job,
6814060	6816060	and he's dissatisfied.
6816060	6818060	We're walking away, and he's calling us assholes.
6818060	6819060	What?
6819060	6821060	You worked at Radio Shack, and the manager had a problem?
6821060	6824060	Would you leave your family to burn?
6825060	6826060	That made a lot of sense.
6826060	6827060	Hordegard!
6827060	6828060	Hordegard!
6828060	6829060	Is there a dark...
6829060	6831060	Is there some dark area nearby where we can hide
6831060	6833060	where the cops don't find us?
6833060	6835060	I don't know.
6835060	6836060	Probably.
6836060	6837060	Just statistically.
6837060	6838060	Eve, can you ask for Eagle?
6838060	6840060	Can I cast invisibility over all of us
6840060	6842060	and make us and the truck disappear?
6842060	6843060	Not the truck.
6843060	6846060	You could do it on people, but it's going to take some drain.
6846060	6847060	I could also use...
6847060	6849060	I could use Phantasm and create some other thing
6849060	6850060	to distract the cops.
6850060	6852060	I could make some other thing happen far away
6852060	6855060	that makes the cops go somewhere else to buy us some time.
6855060	6856060	You could.
6856060	6857060	Oh.
6857060	6858060	All right.
6858060	6859060	So how close are the cops?
6859060	6861060	Oh, they're going to be here in a couple minutes.
6861060	6862060	A couple minutes.
6862060	6864060	Johnson, do you want out of this problem?
6865060	6866060	Maybe.
6866060	6868060	But only for very cheap.
6868060	6870060	Name a price.
6870060	6871060	700.
6871060	6874060	700 for each person that risks their life?
6874060	6876060	No.
6876060	6878060	Just to solve the situation.
6878060	6879060	All right, see ya.
6879060	6881060	What kind of race?
6881060	6882060	Let's go.
6882060	6884060	The guy's like...
6884060	6885060	You sons of bitches.
6885060	6887060	Yeah, but you got no right to say that anymore.
6887060	6889060	You had an opportunity.
6889060	6892060	Like, tell your accountant, you know.
6892060	6893060	See ya.
6893060	6896060	I go towards the street where the cops are coming.
6896060	6898060	I can hear the street where they're going to be coming from, right?
6898060	6899060	Right.
6899060	6901060	And I say, everybody, get in the truck, get ready to get the hell out of here.
6901060	6904060	I'm going to create a Phantasm to scare the hell out of these cops.
6904060	6907060	When it starts, we have to get the hell out of here and go the other direction.
6907060	6909060	Johnson, you want to come with us or do you want out?
6909060	6911060	Well, I need that truck. I mean...
6911060	6913060	Yeah, so we'll all get in the truck together with the merchandise
6913060	6915060	and we'll go somewhere else and get away from these cops.
6915060	6916060	I'll drive the truck.
6916060	6917060	Sounds good.
6917060	6918060	All right.
6918060	6919060	Johnson likes it.
6919060	6922060	I can just say that they're medical supplies if the police stop me.
6922060	6923060	All right.
6923060	6924060	You guys, everybody in the truck, I'm going to try this.
6924060	6926060	We only got one shot of this, you guys.
6926060	6929060	And also, our show is about to be over, so this has to count.
6929060	6930060	All right.
6930060	6931060	All right, let's go.
6931060	6932060	All right.
6932060	6934060	The truck rolls out of the parking lot.
6934060	6935060	Maria rolls.
6935060	6936060	Okay.
6936060	6940060	I go out into the streets and I touch my red feather earring
6940060	6945060	and I summon all the magic of my training,
6945060	6949060	my elven upbringing and my Native American tribe.
6949060	6952060	And I summon a spirit...
6952060	6958060	I summon a 20-foot-tall flaming gorilla to stand in the middle of the streets
6958060	6962060	and just start freaking out in front of the cop cars.
6962060	6965060	Not only is it a giant gorilla, it's also angry.
6965060	6966060	No, no.
6966060	6969060	This is a flaming gorilla that means business.
6969060	6971060	But it's only a phantasm. I can't really hurt him.
6971060	6973060	It's just going to scare these cops.
6973060	6975060	And I cast it as a level five.
6975060	6976060	All right, that's a level five.
6976060	6979060	Level five, flaming gorilla, middle of the road, freaking out.
6979060	6984060	You know, it occurs to me I could have done the barrier here.
6989060	6992060	But I feel like I've already done it and now it's not going to work.
6992060	6993060	You kind of shot your watch.
6993060	6994060	You shot your watch.
6994060	6995060	I shot it.
6995060	6996060	This would be the perfect time for it.
6996060	6998060	If I'd known this is where we were going,
6998060	7000060	I would have waited on the barrier for now.
7000060	7003060	We should have given you the script. We write it.
7003060	7005060	This is the problem. Hey, don't get the script.
7005060	7008060	Doctor, remember before when you told me that I'm bigger than this
7008060	7009060	and there's more to me?
7009060	7010060	Yes.
7010060	7011060	I think that we're all learning something today
7011060	7013060	and that you're going to use to harness this ability
7013060	7016060	and know when to time it better next time.
7016060	7017060	And to use it for good.
7017060	7018060	Yes.
7018060	7021060	Level five, gorilla.
7021060	7024060	A gorilla sprouts up. He's 20 feet tall.
7024060	7028060	He's beating his chest, which is on fire.
7028060	7030060	He's mean in business.
7030060	7033060	And you guys scoot off into the night.
7033060	7034060	Scoot.
7036060	7039060	If there's any cops following you, they make no indication.
7039060	7042060	Twenty minutes later, your eagle friend goes,
7042060	7045060	hey, I found Baldwin.
7045060	7047060	You're not going to like it, though.
7047060	7048060	Why not?
7048060	7050060	He's in a business building, I mean.
7050060	7051060	He's in a building.
7051060	7053060	God damn it.
7053060	7056060	That's our kryptonite.
7056060	7059060	Are you saying there's a roof and walls
7059060	7063060	and there's some sort of organization inside that makes money?
7064060	7068060	Yeah, I mean, it's a telepathic link.
7068060	7071060	You guys, it looks like we're going to have to get Baldwin.
7071060	7075060	Which business, Eagle?
7075060	7078060	Oh, I don't know.
7078060	7082060	So you truly thought we weren't going to like that he was in a business?
7082060	7083060	Oh, wait, no.
7083060	7088060	You're not going to like the defense mechanisms around the business.
7088060	7090060	Oh.
7090060	7092060	What are they?
7092060	7096060	Oh, they got magical barriers.
7096060	7097060	Whoa.
7097060	7098060	Sounds like me.
7098060	7102060	That sounds like a case for the magical barrier doctor to come in.
7102060	7103060	Cliffhanger!
7103060	7105060	Wait a minute.
7106060	7109060	Curtis Armstrong will be back next week to reprise his role
7109060	7113060	as the astroly projecting doctor.
7113060	7115060	Thank you all for coming.
7115060	7116060	Curtis Armstrong.
7116060	7118060	Curtis Armstrong.
7118060	7119060	Thank you.
7120060	7123060	Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crittenden.
7123060	7124060	I'm Jeff Davis.
7124060	7126060	Thank you everyone here at Meltdown Comics.
7126060	7129060	Your mayor, everybody, Mr. Dan Harmon.
7138060	7140060	Did you get any of that?
7140060	7143060	It's a good show.
7149060	7150060	Thank you.
