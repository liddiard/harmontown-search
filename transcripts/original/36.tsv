0	16320	Addison, Wisconsin, hello!
16320	34520	Somewhere through west of Milwaukee, Madison, by a bunch of lakes, I don't know.
34520	37560	Hermit Town is now in session.
37560	46560	Would you please welcome to the stage Wisconsin's own mayor, Dan Herman!
46560	53560	Thank you, Madison, Wisconsin.
53560	59560	Thank you very, very much.
59560	62560	You are too kind.
62560	68560	You are too numerous, you are probably too cold, and your room is too echoey.
68560	80560	But we are going to imagine me as just a god in a cave for this episode.
80560	82560	Is it echoey out there or just for us?
82560	85560	Maybe it just bounces back weird for us.
85560	87560	Hello?
87560	89560	Hello?
89560	92560	Jeff, quick improv sketch in a cave.
92560	100560	Okay, man, this place is dark and I found a sandwich.
100560	102560	I'm Batman.
102560	103560	Whoa!
103560	105560	All right, so you know, good.
105560	108560	As long as you can make it work for yourself.
108560	117560	This is as close as we're going to get to my hometown of Milwaukee on this tour.
117560	119560	I know.
119560	120560	I know.
120560	122560	Did someone just yell out, we love beer?
122560	123560	Is that what he said?
123560	124560	Brown beer!
124560	125560	Brown beer.
125560	126560	Oh, yeah, brown beer, yeah.
126560	127560	Is that Friedel?
127560	128560	Wait, where's my buddy Friedel?
128560	129560	Is Friedel here?
129560	130560	There he is.
130560	131560	Where's Friedel?
131560	134560	My best friend from high school is here tonight, Dave Friedel.
134560	137560	Let's get him up here.
137560	139560	Let's bring him up.
139560	142560	Okay, well, he has a story to tell.
143560	145560	Dave, do you think he can make it up?
145560	150560	Because I know part of the story involves your locomotion.
150560	153560	Do you think he can make it up here, Dave?
153560	154560	Sure.
164560	166560	Break down, Madison, Wisconsin.
166560	168560	Fuck your mama in the mouth in the tonsils.
168560	170560	I fucked your mama like my name was Dan.
170560	171560	My name is Dan.
171560	172560	Fucked her like a man.
172560	173560	Fucked her once.
173560	174560	Fucked her twice.
174560	175560	Fucked her fleas.
175560	176560	Fucked her lice.
176560	177560	Fucked her in the barn.
177560	179560	Fucked her in the hole.
179560	182560	Fucked her like a pole lock.
182560	183560	From Milwaukee.
183560	187560	Fucked her with a walkie talkie like my name is Bruce Willis.
187560	188560	Die hard.
188560	191560	Fucked your mama by the yard.
191560	192560	Here's a yard.
192560	193560	It's my dick.
193560	194560	Here's two yards.
194560	195560	Both my dick.
195560	196560	Fifty yards.
196560	197560	Whole thing's my dick.
197560	198560	I got a football dick.
198560	200560	Go Packers, go!
204560	206560	That wasn't bad, Jeff.
206560	207560	That wasn't a bad wrap.
207560	209560	We're off to a mid-start.
209560	210560	I like that.
210560	212560	It wasn't a good one, but...
212560	213560	I should.
213560	216560	Unlike most of my raps, that was not bad.
216560	219560	I like that you fucked your fleas and your lice.
219560	220560	Yeah.
220560	223560	Yeah, you can see where I think of the rhyme.
223560	226560	What's another thing like lice that...
226560	227560	Dave Friedel, everybody.
228560	229560	That's...
230560	231560	Friedel.
233560	234560	Thank you.
234560	236560	Dave Friedel, my best friend.
236560	241560	I met Dave when I was 15, 14 years old.
241560	246560	I just transferred into Brown Deer High School in Brown Deer, Wisconsin.
246560	249560	From Marshall High School, which is 4,000 students.
249560	255560	And then I transferred into this 600 students, like suburban high school.
255560	258560	And not the coolest entrance.
258560	262560	I wore a few felled pants and...
264560	269560	Did own an Inspector Gadget raincoat, which I did wear frequently, and blah, blah, blah.
269560	271560	Not the coolest guy coming into the school.
271560	277560	Dave was the first guy who befriended me because he saw my Dungeons & Dragons t-shirt.
277560	280560	Yeah, it was something along those lines.
280560	282560	I mean, it was one of those ones where it's just in homeroom.
282560	284560	I think it was...
284560	290560	The D&D and the connection was made real early on that freshman year.
290560	295560	I can't remember if it was you approached me first, or I approached you, or whatever it was.
295560	298560	I remember it as you coming up to me and going like,
298560	299560	Hey, you role play?
299560	301560	You saw my Dungeons & Dragons shirt.
301560	302560	I said, yeah.
302560	304560	He said, you used a computer?
304560	307560	It was easy to be a nerd back then.
307560	312560	There was one way to be a nerd back then.
312560	318560	If you had a computer, if you knew what one was or how to turn it on instead of a typewriter, you were a nerd.
318560	323560	And there were TV shows about how people would use computers to make the refrigerator open
323560	329560	or make the world go to war with itself because computers were magical and before nerds alone.
329560	335560	And then you told me about the Citizens Band emulator, which was like this 300-pod chat room.
336560	338560	Which is where I lost my virginity.
338560	344560	I met the girl I lost my virginity to, the LA podcast episode where I'm reading from my journals,
344560	346560	and I'm talking about the girl that I...
346560	348560	Sand pollution.
348560	349560	Yes.
349560	350560	The girl that I...
350560	353560	The condom froze to the room in the car.
353560	357560	And I had such good sex with that she went to a mental hospital.
357560	359560	I was the...
359560	361560	Stan Lee needs to come in the bottom and go,
361560	367560	Deb Hansel, remember Dan fucking a girl mental from issue number 128.
367560	370560	So you fucked your brains out, is what you said.
370560	372560	Well, that's how we choose to interpret it.
372560	379560	Not that I sent her into a lifelong depression with my adolescent ruddings.
383560	385560	My point is, Friedel is a linchpin.
385560	387560	He's a galactic nexus.
387560	390560	We're so close to my hometown, Friedel came out here,
390560	395560	and I want to talk about your toe.
395560	398560	Oh, man. Of course.
401560	404560	So some woman made a theme song out there.
404560	405560	Yeah.
410560	413560	I think Peter Gabriel is here tonight.
414560	419560	Friedel, Friedel's toe, Friedel's toe.
419560	420560	I promise you.
420560	423560	There's a Friedel's toe,
423560	427560	because he can walk around.
427560	430560	There's a George Michael version that's real popular, I think.
430560	431560	You got a blister on your toe.
431560	434560	Yeah, blister.
434560	435560	The story does not end there.
435560	437560	No, no, it doesn't end there.
437560	439560	The blister got a little out of control,
439560	442560	and I thought I'd taken care of it
442560	445560	and cleaned it up and was doing the proper care to it,
445560	448560	but maybe I quit the antibiotics a little too early
448560	449560	or something along those lines.
449560	452560	And so by mid-December,
452560	455560	when I started to notice the toes smelling like cheese,
455560	457560	I thought that there was...
457560	460560	Toes stories are not going to make you feel warm and cuddly.
460560	462560	This is not date night.
462560	466560	Hey, we're from Wisconsin here, so it's a...
466560	472560	Yeah, it's a familiar smell or something.
472560	476560	When cottage cheese goes bad, so...
476560	479560	Yeah, so the toe went and started to go bad.
479560	481560	Which toe on which foot?
481560	483560	It's the right.
483560	486560	The right big toe.
486560	488560	So your big toe on your right foot?
488560	490560	Yeah, it's a month removed.
490560	491560	It's been gone?
491560	492560	Yeah.
492560	494560	Now, how does that affect your ability to stand up?
494560	495560	Does you need big toes?
495560	499560	I seem to be doing pretty good and getting around.
499560	504560	So it turns out we don't need our big toe for anything, do we?
504560	506560	I've been told...
506560	509560	Unless I want to put basketball, you know what I mean?
509560	511560	What do they do with their big toes?
511560	515560	I may have some calisthenics or jumping problems, but...
515560	517560	But here's the creepy thing about the whole thing.
517560	519560	Can we see it? Can you take it off?
519560	521560	It's all bandaged up.
521560	523560	It's all bandaged up.
523560	526560	Here's the weird thing, okay?
526560	530560	And I'm going to approach the weirdness in stages.
530560	535560	Our dungeon master, Spencer, has two toes fused together,
535560	539560	so he's technically also missing a toe.
539560	544560	David Friedel was my first Dungeons & Dragons buddy in high school.
544560	551560	David Friedel, his name is Germanic, Friedel, but what did we call you?
551560	552560	Freedom.
552560	554560	Free toe.
554560	555560	Free toe.
555560	556560	Free toe.
556560	557560	Like the corn chip.
557560	560560	He is now free of a toe.
560560	562560	Like Spencer.
562560	564560	Who has two toes fused together?
564560	568560	Less impressive to the audience than I...
568560	572560	You're saying a string of meaningless witsnits.
572560	574560	I'm saying...
574560	576560	Let's bring Spencer out right now.
576560	577560	Alright, let's bring Spencer out.
577560	579560	I want him to be a freedom.
582560	584560	Whoo!
590560	593560	Spencer, this is my buddy, Dave Friedel.
593560	595560	He was my first Spencer.
598560	602560	He didn't really dungeon master, but we played D&D together, right?
602560	605560	Yeah, but you did D&D together, but it was Shadow Run.
605560	607560	That was a game that I ran later on.
607560	609560	You GM'd a little, right?
609560	611560	Yeah, that was the game that I GM'd.
611560	615560	I mean, the Dungeons & Dragons sketch that you wrote for the Ale-Wise,
615560	617560	I remember you ran that session,
617560	622560	and that was one of the first sessions when the three or four of us all got together to start playing.
622560	625560	It was real early on freshman year,
625560	627560	and almost...
627560	631560	I don't want to say verbatim that you took that set from that session.
631560	634560	There's a lot of stuff that I remember that came out.
634560	636560	Yeah, that was a right what you know thing.
636560	639560	How do you think Spencer's been doing as a freshman?
639560	641560	Oh, he's great.
641560	643560	Excellent.
646560	651560	I spent the last couple of days really kind of catching up on the podcast tour and things like that.
651560	657560	And even this afternoon with my wife, we were listening to the Turtle Panties episode,
657560	661560	where you sort of, in my opinion, I think you were setting up the tour very, very well.
661560	664560	And so I'm just fascinated.
664560	666560	I'm two or three podcasts behind,
666560	670560	but I really can't wait to hear what's kind of been going on and get caught up.
670560	672560	Thanks, man. That's awesome.
674560	677560	Dave, what was your character in D&D?
679560	681560	I couldn't remember.
681560	684560	I mean, Ars Magica was one of the other...
684560	685560	Ars Magica?
685560	687560	Yeah, that was where Maxwell Artfall...
687560	689560	I forgot the name of that.
689560	693560	That was the Maxwell Artfall character, was Ars.
693560	696560	I can't remember my character names. They were always pretty dumb.
696560	698560	I can never remember anything.
698560	700560	Dave was my first friend in high school,
700560	703560	and he was my first drinking buddy, too.
703560	705560	We used to get... we would get drunk.
705560	707560	We would raid the parents' booze cabinets,
707560	710560	and we would mix tequila with Mountain Dew and...
710560	713560	And apple juice and anything else that was...
713560	715560	Yeah, anything we could get our hands on.
715560	720560	And I can't drink gin to this day because I had one bottle of gin.
720560	723560	That's all we had, and I drank so much of it, I puked,
723560	728560	and anything with gin in it will now make me puke.
728560	730560	Not important.
730560	734560	I mean, you guys are the people that don't give a shit about that toe nexus.
734560	739560	So at this point, I mean, it's pearls before swine, frankly.
739560	742560	I'll just tell you what I had for breakfast in the morning.
742560	746560	Your toe is cut off right at the base of the toe, or where?
746560	748560	Yeah, it's kind of at an angle.
748560	752560	I mean, I can take the shoe off, but not...
752560	754560	Take it off. Take the shoe off.
756560	761560	I think we owe it to the audience to see what the hell's going on here.
762560	764560	All right, while he does that...
764560	770560	Spencer, I'm being attacked by an orthopedic surgeon...
772560	774560	...rushing at you with his bone saw.
774560	778560	The orthopedic surgeon has eyes only for your foots.
779560	785560	He dives directly at you, sword-drawn, bloodless, raging in his eyes.
786560	789560	Foot. That's all.
789560	798560	That was a smooth jazz DM fusion.
798560	800560	Not the track I would have chosen.
800560	802560	I hit the rock track.
802560	804560	Speaking of...
804560	806560	Meanwhile, something terrible is going on.
806560	808560	Oh, shit.
808560	810560	Oh, fuck. That is a man without a...
810560	812560	Yeah, so that's it.
812560	815560	Wait, so how recent was this?
816560	822560	I lost... They amputated the toe on Christmas Eve morning.
822560	824560	So, yeah, like I said, 30 days ago.
824560	826560	But that's good luck, right?
826560	828560	Yeah, I mean...
828560	832560	So they didn't bring me shit. He took my toe.
832560	835560	They didn't cut the whole toe off. They cut it off at a diagonal.
835560	837560	Yeah, they kind of got it at a diagonal.
837560	839560	So you have that last phalange there?
839560	841560	Yeah, and I still have the...
841560	844560	Yeah, the metatarsus. Sorry, Jesus Christ.
844560	847560	I don't think it's the same lady from the darkness.
847560	849560	It would be weird if she was like...
849560	851560	It's still a phalange, isn't it?
853560	855560	Phalanges are here.
855560	857560	Come on, dude.
858560	860560	All right. What did they cut off?
860560	862560	What's at stake, sir?
862560	865560	Come on, dude, what? Finish your thought.
865560	868560	Come on, dude. Get your toe shit together.
868560	870560	You're going to get late tonight.
870560	872560	I mean, I have a girlfriend.
874560	878560	I'm skipping town tonight like a thief in the night.
878560	881560	I want you to get your money's worth, but...
881560	884560	Aren't they still called phalanges on your toes, man?
884560	886560	They are.
886560	888560	Metacarpal and metatarsals on your foot.
888560	890560	The end is still called phalanges, right?
890560	892560	There's the carpals and the metacarpals
892560	894560	and the tarsals and the metatarsals,
894560	896560	and I think those are all phalanges.
896560	898560	Yeah, so fuck off, whoever you are.
899560	903560	Crazy drunk foot doctor lady.
905560	907560	No more my ties for her.
908560	910560	And foot books.
911560	913560	She's drunk on knowledge.
913560	914560	She's abusing it.
914560	917560	So, Dave, you had a blister that went bad,
917560	919560	and now part of your toe is gone.
919560	920560	Yeah.
920560	921560	That's fucked up.
921560	923560	It's a cautionary tale, if ever there was one.
923560	925560	Take your blisters seriously, people.
925560	927560	What did you do wrong?
927560	929560	What can you tell these poor kids?
929560	931560	If you could go back in time...
931560	933560	And don't eat sweets if you're diabetic,
933560	935560	take your insulin and stuff like that.
935560	939560	That's the other component of it as well.
939560	945560	I want it to be the same lady the whole time.
945560	947560	Whoa, diabetes!
947560	950560	What expertise!
950560	952560	We're going to cure diabetes in Wisconsin.
952560	954560	Wait, what did he say about diabetes in Wisconsin?
954560	956560	We're going to cure it in Wisconsin.
956560	958560	We're going to cure it in Wisconsin?
958560	959560	We're going to cure it in Wisconsin.
959560	960560	Oh, we cheer it.
960560	961560	Okay, well...
961560	963560	Yeah, I hope.
964560	966560	Wait, is that a diabetes thing?
967560	969560	And I was...
969560	971560	To say that that wasn't a contributing factor,
971560	973560	because I do have diabetes.
973560	975560	Yeah, that would be a diabetes factor.
975560	977560	Okay, so it's not that you ate a bunch of Twinkies
977560	979560	and got a blister in your toe chemo.
979560	983560	It wasn't that simple, but yeah.
983560	988560	It's the combined whatever actions of having the disease.
988560	989560	Oh, I see.
989560	992560	So it wasn't just that you had an infection that went awry.
992560	995560	But it is an infection that, yes, went very awry.
995560	996560	What could you have done differently?
996560	998560	I think that the thing was...
998560	1000560	Well, the thing that I think...
1000560	1005560	Well, I don't know other than perhaps to have seen the doctor more often
1005560	1007560	gotten stayed on the antibiotics a little bit longer.
1007560	1009560	Oh, I see.
1009560	1011560	I just want to know if that guy said...
1011560	1014560	Are you not going to leave him alone or leave it alone?
1014560	1015560	Was that your advice about a blister?
1015560	1017560	Leave it alone!
1017560	1020560	Like he picked at it until his toe came off?
1020560	1022560	Stop picking at it.
1022560	1027560	I have one last thing to ask about diabetes, Dave.
1027560	1036560	Is it true what I heard that it can be cured with a wrap about diabetes?
1048560	1049560	No toe.
1049560	1051560	What a brother knows.
1051560	1053560	Ain't too many Twinkies lost my toe.
1053560	1054560	Going down low.
1054560	1055560	Good.
1055560	1056560	Free toe.
1056560	1057560	Free toe.
1057560	1058560	Gotta lose his toe.
1058560	1060560	Went to the doctor the other day.
1060560	1062560	Said, what am I going to do?
1062560	1063560	He said, no way.
1063560	1064560	Leave the blister alone.
1064560	1066560	Put it up on a table.
1066560	1068560	You're going to be in a toeless stable.
1068560	1076560	If you don't, follow my directions.
1076560	1080560	Fuck your mama with my erections.
1080560	1083560	Madison, Madison, Madison.
1083560	1086560	Madison, Madison, Madison.
1086560	1088560	Madison, Madison, Madison.
1088560	1091560	Capitol building, man town, USA.
1091560	1093560	Fuck your mama so hard, she thought I was gay.
1093560	1098560	She said, how could you be that attentive to women without knowing just part of it yourself,
1098560	1099560	is what she meant.
1099560	1101560	She wasn't homophobic.
1101560	1102560	No way.
1102560	1109560	She was an advocate.
1109560	1115560	And we spent a long summer together.
1115560	1123560	And I fucked her a lot.
1123560	1126560	Is it the weirdest audience that we've ever had, Jeff?
1126560	1128560	In terms of their relationship with us?
1128560	1130560	It's the audio here.
1130560	1132560	It's the distance between us and the darkness.
1132560	1133560	It's a cavern.
1133560	1136560	You guys are like dark crystal muppets.
1136560	1138560	We can only see shapes.
1138560	1145560	And then here, ideally, you would all be up on stage surrounding us.
1145560	1150560	I'm still trying to figure out what makes you angry and what makes you clap.
1150560	1155560	There's a sense of outrage when I...
1155560	1157560	What's that, sir?
1157560	1159560	Yes, we can talk about it.
1159560	1162560	Otherwise, there's no show.
1162560	1166560	Are you saying, sir, that you'd like to talk about it?
1166560	1168560	What's your name, sir?
1168560	1169560	Ethan.
1169560	1170560	Ethan, come on.
1170560	1177560	Can you spiral up here, Ethan?
1177560	1181560	If you're young and spry, you can do it this way, yeah.
1181560	1184560	All right, Ethan.
1184560	1187560	Hey, Dan Harmon.
1187560	1188560	Can I sit down?
1188560	1189560	Yeah, yeah, sit down.
1189560	1190560	Can I sit down?
1190560	1192560	Thank you.
1192560	1194560	No, stand up like a gentleman.
1194560	1196560	All right.
1196560	1197560	Jeff Davis.
1197560	1201560	You haven't earned Dave Freeland's status where you can just sit down.
1201560	1206560	You have to cut off your psyche's toe before you get a chair.
1206560	1208560	Jeff Davis, I would follow you into the gates of hell.
1208560	1209560	Is that right?
1209560	1211560	I knew you before I knew Dan Harmon.
1211560	1213560	Well, God bless you.
1213560	1214560	What's your name again?
1214560	1215560	Ethan.
1215560	1216560	Ethan.
1217560	1219560	Will you sing a country song for us?
1219560	1222560	Which one?
1222560	1224560	This one.
1224560	1226560	Take it, Ethan.
1226560	1232560	I've never been to Texas.
1232560	1237560	I don't know what they think.
1237560	1238560	Do, do, do.
1238560	1244560	Maybe it was fun in Austin.
1244560	1248560	But why are you avoiding Milwaukee?
1248560	1251560	Oh, all right.
1251560	1252560	Pretty good.
1252560	1253560	That's not bad.
1253560	1254560	Not bad.
1254560	1255560	Well, here's why.
1255560	1256560	Are you from Milwaukee?
1256560	1257560	No, I'm from Chicago.
1257560	1259560	Oh.
1259560	1262560	I couldn't get tickets, so I had to, like, I, we drove here,
1262560	1263560	and I, I love you so much.
1263560	1265560	You should have called me.
1265560	1267560	I tried to Twitter you, but it didn't work.
1267560	1271560	Uh...
1271560	1273560	It's, uh, it's, it's routing.
1273560	1275560	It's nothing personal between me and Milwaukee,
1275560	1277560	although I will say I was beaten there.
1277560	1278560	You were beaten there?
1278560	1280560	Well, most people do get beaten in their hometowns.
1280560	1281560	It's just...
1281560	1283560	Who's, who's in Milwaukee tonight?
1283560	1284560	What's that?
1284560	1286560	Who's in Milwaukee tonight that you couldn't be there?
1286560	1288560	Who got, who beat you to Milwaukee?
1288560	1289560	I don't understand what you're saying.
1289560	1290560	No, no, no.
1290560	1292560	He was beaten as a child.
1292560	1294560	He wasn't beaten there in a cannon.
1294560	1295560	A child abuse.
1295560	1296560	A child abuse.
1296560	1297560	A Snyder was in Milwaukee.
1297560	1299560	His parents couldn't be there.
1299560	1301560	I was beaten there by Bob Goldthwaite.
1302560	1303560	He's...
1303560	1306560	We're on the world's least viewed reality show.
1306560	1307560	I'm so sorry.
1307560	1308560	I wasn't beaten.
1308560	1309560	I was just abandoned.
1309560	1310560	Oh.
1310560	1311560	I want to...
1311560	1314560	Can we hug it eventually, like, later, like, after the show?
1316560	1319560	The dance is something I've never seen on the podcast,
1319560	1321560	and it kind of blows my mind a little bit.
1321560	1323560	Do you want to touch me?
1323560	1325560	A little bit, yeah.
1325560	1326560	All right.
1326560	1328560	Uh, the, uh...
1328560	1329560	That's enough.
1329560	1331560	So you're from Chicago.
1331560	1333560	What's your biggest fantasy, Ethan?
1333560	1334560	Like, I don't know.
1334560	1335560	Like, what do you want?
1335560	1339560	My biggest fantasy would be to have, like, three dudes,
1339560	1342560	like, animate anything I told them to animate.
1342560	1343560	And, dude, no, no, no.
1343560	1346560	No, my biggest fantasy would be to have Justin Boylan.
1346560	1349560	Ethan, Ethan, Ethan, Ethan.
1349560	1352560	Ethan, do they have to be dudes?
1352560	1353560	That's a good question.
1353560	1357560	It's part of your fantasy that only dudes animate your fantasies.
1357560	1358560	Ooh.
1358560	1359560	I think the animation part is the...
1359560	1360560	This is...
1360560	1361560	Is the necessary part.
1361560	1362560	I think it's the...
1362560	1363560	No, no, no.
1363560	1365560	Jeff Davis hit on something, I think, that's really important.
1365560	1366560	Dudes.
1367560	1368560	Dudes.
1368560	1369560	They got wieners.
1369560	1370560	They're not Mexican.
1370560	1372560	They're not gonna say that word.
1372560	1373560	Okay.
1374560	1376560	Fucked up, went down a dark road.
1380560	1386560	Whoever it is, if there's anyone of any version of Latin origin here,
1387560	1390560	you come up stage and just...
1391560	1393560	Latinas, Latinas here?
1394560	1395560	Okay.
1395560	1397560	The Toe expert lady.
1401560	1402560	Are you okay with being white?
1402560	1403560	What's that?
1403560	1404560	Are you okay with being white?
1404560	1405560	Am I okay being white?
1405560	1407560	Well, I...
1408560	1410560	Membership has its privileges.
1410560	1411560	Uh...
1415560	1416560	You get a bigger car.
1416560	1417560	You get a longer driveway.
1417560	1420560	You get to talk and not just in the driveway.
1420560	1421560	You get to golf.
1421560	1422560	You get to eat mayo.
1422560	1423560	I love being white.
1423560	1425560	Yay, yay-o.
1427560	1428560	I don't know.
1429560	1430560	It's, uh...
1431560	1432560	It's burdensome.
1433560	1434560	It's burdensome.
1434560	1437560	It's gotta be the hardest race to be, right, because of all the guilt?
1438560	1442560	Well, dude, I've listened to, like, every one of your shows,
1442560	1445560	and lately, even, it seems like you've been really...
1445560	1446560	You've been talking about it a lot.
1446560	1448560	I'm working on a lot of my issues on the road.
1448560	1449560	Like, I...
1449560	1450560	There's some themes developing.
1450560	1451560	Race is...
1451560	1454560	I mean, race has always been a theme of the show, but we're getting more specific.
1454560	1456560	Like, I brought all the black people in the audience.
1456560	1457560	Yeah, yeah, that was weird.
1457560	1460560	And then I started rapping about fucking, like, government.
1460560	1462560	And here's another thing that happened.
1462560	1463560	It hasn't aired yet.
1463560	1466560	In Chicago, we started rapping at the end of the show,
1466560	1470560	and then it turned into this weird, low-stakes American Idol thing
1470560	1472560	where people started coming up, and they wanted to rap,
1472560	1475560	and people would boo them or not, and then they would get off and stuff.
1475560	1476560	This line for him.
1476560	1478560	And then this guy that wasn't really a Harman Town fan,
1478560	1481560	I think he'd been dragged away by his friends, kind of a...
1481560	1482560	Lee Stout.
1482560	1483560	Yeah, his name was Khalil.
1483560	1485560	He closes the show, spoiler, but he's like...
1487560	1490560	His demeanor is very, like, giggly offstage,
1490560	1492560	but he came up with, like, this kind of, I would say,
1492560	1497560	ice-cubish kind of, like, register, and he laid it out,
1497560	1500560	and he used the N-word with grace and...
1501560	1502560	A plump.
1502560	1506560	Yeah, and I had a fucking spasm, like, I...
1506560	1508560	Because I don't want to ever have...
1508560	1511560	I don't want to ever say it, but I love it.
1511560	1512560	I love it.
1512560	1515560	And I do have some kind of strange...
1515560	1518560	Like, I got something to work out with black people.
1518560	1519560	I don't know what it is.
1519560	1521560	Should we bring all the Latinos up on stage right now?
1521560	1523560	I don't have anything to work out with, though.
1523560	1524560	Okay, why that, though?
1524560	1526560	Why are you bringing Latinos up on stage?
1526560	1527560	That's kind of weird.
1527560	1528560	Why not?
1528560	1531560	Well, yeah, it seems racist to think that's weird.
1531560	1533560	Why is this so weird?
1533560	1535560	Well, all the Latinos are going on stage right now, please.
1535560	1537560	All the Latinos are going on stage.
1537560	1540560	Okay, if you were vaguely laughing...
1540560	1542560	Okay, we got two takers.
1542560	1543560	Ethan out!
1543560	1545560	Ethan, thank you, Ethan.
1545560	1546560	Thank you, Ethan. That was cool.
1546560	1548560	All right, Ethan did one of the cool Harman Town moves.
1548560	1549560	He just missed himself.
1549560	1550560	We like that.
1551560	1554560	I'd say give Ethan a t-shirt if we can handle it.
1555560	1557560	All right, we got a healthy...
1557560	1558560	Ethan has five Latinos.
1558560	1559560	Yeah.
1560560	1561560	What's your names?
1561560	1562560	Dave.
1562560	1563560	Dave?
1563560	1564560	Dan.
1564560	1565560	Dan?
1565560	1566560	I know I look white.
1566560	1568560	Hey, listen. Oh, my God.
1570560	1572560	Sarah, but I'm only half.
1572560	1574560	Sarah half, okay.
1574560	1575560	Liana.
1575560	1576560	What?
1576560	1577560	Did you say...
1577560	1578560	Liana.
1578560	1579560	Oh, Liana.
1579560	1580560	Liana.
1580560	1581560	Liana!
1581560	1582560	All right.
1582560	1585560	So, what did you hear at this city?
1585560	1590560	Well, I'm Hispanic and like 1 16th Apache, so...
1590560	1591560	Nice.
1591560	1592560	All right.
1592560	1593560	Me too.
1593560	1594560	Me too.
1594560	1595560	I just realized this is as close as we'll ever get.
1595560	1597560	Okay, two people in the audience are going to get this.
1597560	1600560	This is as close as we'll ever get to having...
1600560	1605560	Being able to recreate the animated Rubik's Cube cartoon from the 80s.
1606560	1609560	There was a Rubik's Cube cartoon.
1609560	1611560	It was called Rubik the Amazing Cube.
1611560	1614560	And for some cool reason...
1614560	1615560	I don't know...
1615560	1616560	It was like this...
1616560	1617560	They made it...
1617560	1618560	It was like a...
1618560	1621560	It was a Hispanic family.
1621560	1623560	There was not...
1623560	1625560	Rubik wasn't...
1625560	1631560	He was like an ET kind of figure that could turn into anything Rubik-colored.
1631560	1636560	And in every episode, he'd fall off a shelf and get scrambled.
1636560	1639560	So that's when he loses his powers, you have to solve him.
1639560	1642560	But the kids that traveled with him...
1642560	1645560	They were brothers and sisters and they were all...
1645560	1646560	They were...
1646560	1649560	I don't know if they were Mexican or...
1649560	1652560	They spoke with accents.
1652560	1655560	The actors they hired had accents and they...
1655560	1658560	I remember being a kid and going, well, this is weird.
1658560	1660560	But I had no problem with it.
1660560	1663560	Maybe it's because Manudo was big.
1663560	1667560	And they were like, let's cash in on this Manudo thing.
1667560	1670560	The way everything was Australian when Crocodile Dundee came out.
1670560	1671560	They were just ahead of their time, though.
1671560	1677560	I mean, we're definitely going to be a majority in the United States in like, what, 50 years or something like that?
1677560	1678560	I know.
1678560	1679560	Tomorrow?
1679560	1680560	Yeah, that's...
1680560	1681560	I mean, that really is what...
1681560	1686560	But then, you know, have fun with the Chinese.
1687560	1691560	All the Chinese people come to the stage right now.
1691560	1693560	Every Chinese person up on stage.
1693560	1697560	No, but you have to be a citizen of China.
1697560	1702560	You can't just be some awesome Chinese dude.
1702560	1705560	I want a national up here.
1705560	1709560	So, Dan, we have five Latinas up on stage.
1709560	1711560	It wasn't really my call.
1711560	1712560	I mean...
1712560	1714560	I'm saying, maybe sing a song or...
1715560	1716560	Samba!
1716560	1717560	Samba.
1717560	1720560	Isn't that racist, though?
1720560	1721560	What are we...
1721560	1724560	There's a fine line between irony and...
1724560	1730560	Everyone that's yelling stuff out right now, you're all crossing a weird line.
1730560	1732560	Make them do this.
1732560	1733560	Make them do that.
1733560	1736560	At least learn their names or something.
1736560	1738560	You said you can't share the line.
1738560	1740560	Well, here's the safe thing to do.
1740560	1742560	Shut up for a second.
1743560	1746560	Then you won't cross any lines.
1746560	1751560	I don't want to make them dance or sing.
1751560	1759560	But I think they should do a scene about drug safety.
1759560	1761560	About drug safety?
1761560	1762560	Yeah.
1762560	1763560	Okay, you guys are my family.
1763560	1764560	I'm your youngest child.
1764560	1766560	I'm 15.
1766560	1767560	You're my mom.
1767560	1768560	You're my dad.
1768560	1770560	You're my little brother.
1770560	1772560	And you're my...
1772560	1774560	You are our...
1774560	1775560	You said you were...
1775560	1777560	You said I'm only half or something like that?
1777560	1780560	Okay, you play our White Housekeeper.
1783560	1785560	My name is Ramon.
1785560	1786560	I'm your mom.
1786560	1789560	I know what you do to moms, so...
1789560	1790560	You're...
1790560	1791560	What?
1791560	1792560	I'm your mom.
1792560	1793560	I know what you do to moms.
1793560	1794560	But not my mom.
1794560	1795560	You're safe.
1795560	1797560	You're the only one that's safe.
1798560	1799560	Okay.
1799560	1800560	Mom, dad, I'm home.
1800560	1801560	I'm Ramon.
1801560	1802560	Oh, Ramon.
1802560	1803560	We love you.
1803560	1804560	I'm vaguely Italian.
1804560	1805560	Hey.
1810560	1811560	These better be the tea now.
1811560	1812560	I'm gonna...
1812560	1814560	I'm gonna go to my room, okay?
1814560	1816560	I just want my privacy.
1816560	1818560	I won't be down for dinner.
1820560	1821560	Uh-oh.
1821560	1823560	I've never seen the kid in my life resent.
1824560	1827560	He must have been pretty drunk at the Conception then.
1828560	1830560	Oh, I'm smoking so much weed.
1831560	1833560	Oh, I'm Ramon.
1833560	1835560	I hate to tell you this.
1835560	1837560	That's okay to tell you.
1837560	1839560	I was cleaning his room.
1839560	1846560	I noticed there was some stuff in his underwear drawer.
1847560	1850560	Son, youngest son, what do you know about this?
1850560	1853560	Well, consider the fact we share a ball of pen.
1853560	1857560	We shoot up like five times a week.
1857560	1859560	Well, I'm actually not high anymore.
1859560	1860560	Only night.
1860560	1861560	He's getting down.
1861560	1862560	Actually, I'm kind of hungry.
1862560	1864560	I'll go down for dinner.
1866560	1867560	Actually, I am kind of hungry.
1867560	1868560	I'm down for dinner.
1868560	1869560	All right.
1869560	1870560	Fantastic.
1870560	1871560	What are we getting?
1871560	1872560	Beans and rice?
1872560	1873560	Something like that?
1873560	1874560	Yeah.
1874560	1876560	You know, tacos and chiladas are usual.
1877560	1878560	I get high, okay?
1878560	1879560	I get high.
1883560	1885560	I mean, why shouldn't I, right?
1885560	1887560	It's a white man's country.
1888560	1890560	I mean, what do we mean to them?
1890560	1891560	We're nothing.
1891560	1892560	Nothing!
1893560	1895560	Have you seen that cartoon about the Rubik's Cube?
1895560	1898560	You know, I mean, we've come a long way, so...
1898560	1899560	No, what do you mean?
1899560	1900560	What do you...
1900560	1903560	Look, there it is on the TV.
1903560	1905560	What is that cube?
1905560	1907560	Multiple colors.
1907560	1908560	I get it.
1908560	1909560	I get it.
1910560	1912560	I bet white people won't get it, but I do.
1913560	1915560	It's diversity.
1915560	1917560	Rubik's Cube, I get it.
1917560	1918560	It's the wave of the future.
1918560	1920560	But why, when you solve the cube,
1920560	1923560	do you do it by separating all the colors into sections?
1925560	1928560	Thirty years later, I am Ramon.
1928560	1933560	I am a violent separatist.
1933560	1936560	I have taken over the world.
1939560	1942560	Oh, I got shot in the head.
1942560	1944560	It wasn't fatal, but...
1944560	1948560	Oh, my parents, my family, my White Housekeeper.
1951560	1955560	I'm sorry I turned my back on you for 30 years.
1956560	1958560	I shouldn't have gotten high.
1961560	1963560	Porque!
1965560	1966560	Thank you, Latinos.
1967560	1969560	All right, our Latinos.
1969560	1971560	Our Latino audience, everybody.
1971560	1972560	Thank you so much.
1978560	1980560	Make them dance, make them sing.
1980560	1983560	You guys don't know how to approach these things delicately.
1984560	1986560	I live in Los Angeles.
1987560	1989560	Those were basically my people.
1993560	1994560	I don't.
1995560	1998560	I can't step too far forward or it rings out.
2000560	2003560	Jeff, this is your last show with us for a couple of shows.
2004560	2007560	I leave Harmon Town for the next two shows.
2008560	2011560	I'll see if I can scramble to find somebody to fill in for you.
2014560	2016560	Is there any requests you have?
2016560	2018560	I'm going to buy a party for you.
2018560	2022560	I would like to see more Jerry McSeinfeld.
2024560	2027560	Jerry McSeinfeld has been unleashed a new character
2027560	2030560	where he's the Irish version of Jerry Seinfeld.
2031560	2032560	Where were we?
2032560	2033560	Bloomington.
2033560	2034560	We were in Chicago, I think.
2034560	2036560	No, no, no, we were in Bloomington.
2036560	2038560	Bloomington, Indiana.
2038560	2039560	Jerry McSeinfeld.
2039560	2040560	Jerry McSeinfeld.
2040560	2041560	The Irish Seinfeld.
2041560	2043560	Can I get somebody in the audience?
2043560	2045560	What's a pet peeve?
2046560	2047560	Jerks.
2047560	2048560	Jerks, okay.
2049560	2050560	Talking on phones in line.
2050560	2051560	Say what?
2051560	2053560	Talking on phones in line.
2053560	2057560	Somebody in line in front of you talking on a phone.
2057560	2059560	This is Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
2059560	2060560	Jerry McSeinfeld.
2061560	2062560	Good evening.
2067560	2070560	I would have gotten here sooner.
2072560	2074560	But I had to wait in line.
2075560	2077560	There was a guy in front of me.
2077560	2078560	He kept doing one of these.
2078560	2080560	You ever see one of these?
2080560	2081560	This guy?
2081560	2082560	This guy?
2082560	2084560	Hold my hand up like a phone.
2085560	2087560	Who's he talking to?
2088560	2090560	How's that conversation going?
2090560	2091560	Oh, I'm in line.
2092560	2093560	Hey, everyone's in line.
2093560	2095560	We're not telling the world about it.
2096560	2098560	You know, if you want to call somebody,
2098560	2100560	use a phone booth.
2102560	2103560	Thank you, Dan.
2103560	2104560	All right.
2108560	2110560	What's up with all these phones?
2111560	2113560	When did phones become so important?
2113560	2116560	In my day, you didn't have to have a phone all the time.
2116560	2117560	Now they're everywhere.
2117560	2120560	Well, I guess that's just technology, and it's actually...
2120560	2122560	How about something in the news?
2122560	2123560	Something in the news?
2124560	2125560	The Taliban.
2125560	2126560	The Taliban.
2126560	2128560	Why do they call them the Taliban?
2128560	2131560	It sounds so playful, you know?
2131560	2132560	The Taliban are coming over.
2132560	2134560	That sounds fun, don't it?
2135560	2138560	Call them the skullfuckers or something.
2139560	2142560	Call them the booger-eaters.
2143560	2145560	At least, you know, intimidate them a little bit.
2145560	2147560	You know, when we call you, we call you the booger-eaters.
2147560	2150560	Oh, well, then I won't blow so many things up then.
2151560	2152560	It's just...
2152560	2154560	I observe these things with my Irish perspective,
2154560	2158560	and then I share them, and if you agree, then you like it,
2158560	2160560	and if you don't, then I scratch it off.
2160560	2162560	I scratch it off my set list.
2163560	2167560	What's funny about it is that it's something that really gets your goat.
2167560	2168560	Right to work.
2168560	2169560	What?
2169560	2170560	To drive to work?
2170560	2172560	Okay, Dan.
2172560	2173560	Because...
2173560	2175560	That expression, did me goat.
2175560	2176560	How do you know how to...
2176560	2177560	Did someone's goat?
2177560	2178560	I don't watch your goat.
2178560	2179560	Okay, Dan, Dan, hold up.
2179560	2180560	Hold up?
2180560	2181560	Why do you hold something up?
2181560	2183560	Why can't you hold it down?
2184560	2186560	Just a few things I've been observing.
2196560	2199560	I want a Jerry McSeinfeld rap.
2201560	2202560	About whatever's on your mind.
2202560	2203560	All right.
2206560	2207560	Bring it down.
2209560	2210560	I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.
2210560	2214560	I'm here to say a few things I observed in a casual way.
2214560	2217560	If they resonate with you, I'd like you to laugh or applaud,
2217560	2219560	and if you don't, what's up with giraffes?
2219560	2221560	Why are there next so long?
2221560	2224560	Why can't they eat smaller trees all along?
2224560	2226560	Oh, I went to the zoo.
2226560	2227560	What's a corn nut?
2227560	2228560	It's not a nut.
2228560	2229560	Oh, bees!
2232560	2233560	All right, thank you.
2233560	2234560	All right.
2241560	2242560	We gotta...
2243560	2245560	I'm gonna go on a breakneck pace now
2245560	2248560	and do some confusingly elaborate shit really fast.
2248560	2249560	Okay.
2249560	2254560	My hero and mentor who taught me not only improv
2254560	2258560	but in comedy sports and how to be a cool, good person
2258560	2260560	and have respect for the audience,
2260560	2265560	his son was in Pittsburgh and freaked me out,
2265560	2269560	and then he told his dad that I was coming to Madison
2269560	2270560	and he came here.
2270560	2273560	Bob Orvis, can you come up to the stage?
2273560	2274560	Bob Orvis.
2280560	2281560	Whoa, he bolted.
2285560	2286560	Here he is.
2286560	2287560	Bob Orvis.
2292560	2293560	Okay.
2293560	2297560	And Morgan Grobe, our tour manager,
2297560	2300560	you need to come up here because I'm going to use him for something.
2300560	2301560	I want to do...
2301560	2304560	We'll do it as quickly as possible because I have to do it.
2304560	2305560	Where's Morgan?
2305560	2306560	Morgan coming up?
2306560	2307560	Okay.
2307560	2308560	Morgan Grobe, everybody.
2308560	2309560	All right.
2309560	2311560	Morgan's the brains on the road.
2311560	2312560	He keeps us on schedule.
2312560	2313560	Okay.
2313560	2316560	We're going to play Story because that was the first game
2316560	2319560	I ever learned from Bob and it was the first time
2319560	2322560	anyone ever respected me as an adult and said,
2322560	2324560	hey, you're good at Story and I'm not good at it,
2324560	2326560	but Jeff, you're going to play it too.
2326560	2329560	I feel like Spencer would be kind of good at this.
2329560	2334560	And the interesting thing is when Dan was playing Story,
2334560	2337560	he is right after he had his ass kicked in Milwaukee
2337560	2342560	and his eyes were so swollen that he could only look out the bottom of his eyes.
2342560	2345560	So that getting his ass kicked was a true story.
2345560	2348560	And it wasn't Hispanic people that did it.
2351560	2352560	You know what?
2352560	2353560	It was black people.
2354560	2357560	Maybe that's what it was.
2357560	2360560	Maybe I got this ass beating and it was like,
2360560	2362560	why did they hate me?
2362560	2364560	What can I do for them?
2364560	2365560	I don't know.
2365560	2366560	I've got to work it out.
2366560	2367560	I've got 10 cities left or something.
2367560	2369560	I'll figure out what my deal is with race.
2369560	2371560	Explain the game for them.
2371560	2372560	Well, it's pretty simple.
2372560	2374560	We're just going to tell a story.
2374560	2377560	Whoever he points to tells a story until he points at someone else.
2377560	2379560	It's like basic improv game.
2379560	2381560	Hey, is there room for McGathey's?
2381560	2382560	Would you have a mic?
2382560	2384560	Could we have another mic?
2384560	2385560	She should shoot.
2385560	2386560	Yeah.
2386560	2387560	Well, we have four mics.
2387560	2388560	All right.
2388560	2391560	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
2391560	2392560	All right.
2392560	2393560	We can share a mic.
2393560	2395560	Save Spencer until Spencer can observe how it works.
2395560	2397560	And I think he'll be okay with it.
2397560	2398560	Okay.
2398560	2399560	All right.
2399560	2400560	Let's start.
2400560	2401560	We need the title.
2401560	2402560	A title of a story.
2402560	2404560	Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.
2404560	2405560	See what?
2405560	2406560	Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.
2406560	2408560	Dan Harmon's Excellent Adventure.
2408560	2409560	Okay.
2409560	2410560	Fine.
2410560	2414560	I'm not going to say that, but maybe it'll be a critical hit.
2414560	2417560	I'm going to put fire.
2417560	2418560	All right.
2418560	2419560	Good.
2419560	2420560	Thank you.
2420560	2425560	My jokes agent, ladies and gentlemen.
2425560	2427560	It was a cold and windy night.
2427560	2431560	Dan Harmon had just stopped fucking the lice off my mother.
2431560	2438560	When a thought occurred to him, what if I took a jar of peanut butter and wore it as a hat
2438560	2443560	and became the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin?
2443560	2445560	Would that work?
2445560	2450560	He said to himself as he peeled sweaty socks off of his hands.
2450560	2457560	It had been a long time since he peeled sweaty socks off of anything, if you know what I mean.
2457560	2465560	But we didn't know what he meant, so he demonstrated how he'd peel those hot, sweaty socks.
2466560	2469560	Inch by inch.
2469560	2471560	Inch by inch.
2471560	2475560	Just painstakingly, he pulled off the sock.
2475560	2483560	Peeling slowly off his sweats and skin, the man decided to throw him against the fire,
2483560	2490560	which had been firing in the corner for centuries.
2490560	2494560	Dan burst into the yard with a gun.
2494560	2499560	It was a small gun, it was a harmless gun, because that's Dan Harmon.
2499560	2501560	But lethal nonetheless.
2501560	2504560	Nine rounds to kill nine people.
2504560	2510560	He was going to rob nine people of their souls by shooting them.
2510560	2512560	I don't need to over explain this, do I?
2512560	2513560	I mean, it's murder.
2513560	2514560	It's been around forever.
2514560	2518560	I'm sorry, I tried to make it fancy.
2518560	2526560	Dan walked into the yard with the gun and saw in the corner of the yard a small flower.
2526560	2529560	It changed his mind for a moment.
2529560	2534560	And then his mind changed back to murder.
2534560	2541560	He went somewhere absolutely unusual.
2541560	2544560	He decided he wasn't going to rip that flower apart.
2544560	2554560	He was just not going to water it and just watch it sit and die.
2554560	2564560	With the days as they flew off the calendar, finally the flower died.
2564560	2568560	And he thought to himself, murder's a strange thing.
2568560	2571560	Why did I walk out here with a gun?
2571560	2578560	And then he remembered why and shot his next door neighbor, who was a man by the name of Fred.
2578560	2582560	Fred has been a gardener for about 14 years.
2582560	2600560	Dan had stonked that gardener, that sexy little gardener, with his long shears and his flirtatious eyes full of little heart shapes.
2600560	2608560	The police pulled up at Dan and Carmen's apartment.
2608560	2613560	Oh, what's all this then, Officer McSeinfeld?
2613560	2621560	I couldn't help but notice that your front yard is a cast with dead people.
2621560	2623560	What's with dead people?
2623560	2627560	I just think it's a strange thing to have in one's yard.
2627560	2631560	I mean, I'm no decorator, but I think I have a high-pitched voice.
2631560	2637560	Because I am Irish Seinfeld. What's the deal with blood on your shoes?
2637560	2641560	Why do they call the yards? We're dead foot.
2641560	2647560	I mean, they're arranged in feet, right?
2647560	2652560	Hey, why are we all sucking helium? We were asking each other.
2652560	2661560	Suddenly, Dan turned to the side, and there he saw Fredo's toe creeping toward him.
2661560	2669560	It menaced slowly in the side yard in the shade as it revealed itself.
2669560	2676560	Hi, Dan. Would you like a piece of cake?
2676560	2684560	Fredo's toe. Make her flow like...
2684560	2688560	for all the children.
2688560	2694560	Poof! When Dan's gone, he shot Irish Seinfeld.
2694560	2702560	Oh, why do they call it getting shot, said Irish Seinfeld?
2702560	2706560	Why don't they call it getting bulleted?
2706560	2709560	Bob Barmus, everybody.
2709560	2712560	Bob Barmus.
2712560	2716560	I love you, Bob. Thank you.
2716560	2720560	Yeah.
2720560	2722560	He taught you well.
2722560	2724560	Yeah, I did it. We did it.
2724560	2729560	Yeah, I used to do that for a living, and now I do this, not for a living.
2729560	2732560	I don't know how much of it makes any sense.
2732560	2740560	Dan, you know what time it is? It's D&D time.
2740560	2744560	Spencer, if you would, release the character sheets.
2744560	2745560	All right.
2745560	2747560	Erin McGathey, back to the stage.
2747560	2751560	I lost my vodka cup. Oh, it's behind you. Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you.
2751560	2758560	Finally, someone in the audience yells out something practical with the location of my booze.
2759560	2761560	I'm sorry. That was abusive. You know what it is?
2761560	2764560	It's like you leave the Midwest, you come back, and you start acting like a dick.
2764560	2766560	I'm sorry. Sorry.
2766560	2768560	Dan, do you know your shoes untied?
2768560	2771560	My shoes.
2771560	2775560	Someone just told me my shoes aren't tied.
2775560	2783560	And when someone tells me my shoes aren't tied, I go berserk.
2783560	2787560	Yes, I know it's untied.
2787560	2791560	All right, Spencer, if you would, break us up to date in our campaign.
2791560	2792560	Thank you.
2792560	2796560	Last time on Dragon Ball Z.
2796560	2800560	Old joke, old joke. Our heroes trapped...
2800560	2802560	Stay up here, Fredo.
2802560	2804560	Fredo will advise me if I need a little help.
2804560	2808560	Our heroes, trapped deep within the bowels of the mythical Infinifish,
2808560	2810560	discover a master swordsman.
2810560	2815560	After some prodding, Valicent the swordsman decided to journey deeper with the party.
2815560	2819560	They headed fish west to a passage covered in acid-filled trenches.
2819560	2825560	Using tenders' floating discs to cross the passage, they launched themselves through a meat curtain.
2825560	2828560	There they saw a mysterious eyestock.
2828560	2831560	Using multiple abilities, the creature charmed Quark.
2831560	2836560	But after a fearsome nail-biting action sequence, the eye was destroyed.
2836560	2841560	The group looked on to the three ways ahead before deciding which way to proceed.
2841560	2844560	So do you guys remember you just killed that eye thing?
2844560	2846560	There was three different paths.
2846560	2847560	Right.
2847560	2849560	There's three blue portals, right?
2849560	2852560	Yeah. They're like holes in the wall.
2852560	2853560	Are they labeled at all?
2853560	2855560	They are not labeled.
2855560	2859560	As a ranger, do we have any sense for the right direction?
2859560	2868560	You have a pretty good sense of direction, but most of that is reliant on weather and or local flora and fauna and not the organs of a beast.
2868560	2872560	Gentlemen, I'm pretty confident it's the door on the far right.
2874560	2877560	Or the power of elimination.
2877560	2881560	I detect magic on all three of these orifices.
2881560	2883560	Neither of them are magical.
2883560	2885560	None of them are magical.
2885560	2897560	All right. Being a barbarian, known for my whimsy, I walk up to the center portal and I approach it and examine it.
2897560	2902560	It looks the same as the other two.
2902560	2903560	How big is it?
2903560	2904560	What's up?
2904560	2906560	How large is this portal?
2906560	2910560	I place it at about two and a half feet wide.
2910560	2914560	I put a finger in it.
2914560	2916560	Nothing happens.
2916560	2927560	Okay. I ask the far left door if I say, if I ask the right door, if I should take the middle door, will it tell me yes?
2927560	2930560	It gives a feeder, a feeble shuttle.
2930560	2934560	Dance, magic, dance.
2934560	2936560	Valison pipes up.
2936560	2938560	What are you guys doing?
2938560	2939560	Stick.
2939560	2941560	Oh, I like it.
2941560	2942560	We're doing bits.
2942560	2944560	I thought we were going to talk about swords.
2944560	2948560	Hey, Valison, nice sword you got there.
2948560	2949560	Hey, man. Thanks.
2949560	2951560	Where'd you get that sword?
2951560	2955560	It was forged in the fire of several thousand fire elementals.
2955560	2956560	No shit?
2956560	2958560	Yeah. No, it wasn't.
2958560	2962560	I have an emerald dagger. Do you like daggers or just swords?
2962560	2965560	They're like the baby's sword.
2965560	2968560	Okay. Well, have you seen my flaming sword? It's pretty wild.
2968560	2972560	I've seen it. I mean, can you make it strike far away?
2972560	2975560	Not yet, but can you teach me how to do that?
2975560	2980560	Well, as it happens, I can, but it involves harnessing your rage.
2980560	2984560	I harnessed my rage to learn how to do something.
2984560	2987560	If it were that easy, you know.
2987560	2989560	I'm an angry student.
2989560	2992560	Well, let's see. Swing your sword.
2992560	2993560	I swing my sword.
2993560	2997560	Nice.
2997560	3000560	Your footing's a bit off.
3000560	3001560	See what?
3001560	3003560	Your footing's a bit off. Move your left foot.
3003560	3004560	Follow through.
3004560	3005560	Right.
3005560	3006560	Musical montage.
3006560	3009560	It's in the way that you use it.
3009560	3011560	I swing your sword.
3011560	3012560	Comes and goes.
3012560	3016560	I try on different outfits.
3016560	3018560	I giggle and shake my head.
3018560	3020560	And say next with my mouth.
3020560	3021560	Visual gag.
3021560	3022560	Okay, right.
3022560	3026560	So, I go through a musical montage with Valus,
3026560	3030560	and do I learn how to use my sword better?
3030560	3031560	Let's see here.
3031560	3032560	Yep.
3032560	3033560	Oh, shit.
3033560	3035560	So now you, cut to.
3035560	3038560	Now you know how to use the secret of the Far Sword.
3038560	3042560	But remember, you can only use it once in a short while.
3042560	3046560	Why don't both of you guys use it on two of these doors?
3046560	3049560	And just in case there's something behind it,
3049560	3053560	I'm sure there's not like a beautiful human being on the other side, right?
3053560	3054560	Just standing.
3054560	3057560	That would be the worst case scenario, yeah.
3057560	3058560	In fact, you know what?
3058560	3059560	Let me handle that part.
3059560	3063560	If there's a beautiful human being on the other side of any of these spinters,
3063560	3066560	you're about to get far sorted.
3066560	3071560	If you're bound and gagged,
3071560	3074560	I am bound and gagged now.
3074560	3076560	Don't sword.
3076560	3079560	Yeah, not in that pattern.
3079560	3082560	Also, if there's a less beautiful being, you too.
3082560	3084560	You too move.
3084560	3085560	You'll also be hurt.
3085560	3087560	Yeah, you'll be saving our lives.
3087560	3092560	Okay, so why don't you guys far sword through these holes?
3092560	3093560	Okay.
3093560	3096560	Do we risk killing somebody that we don't want to kill?
3096560	3099560	You could close sword them too.
3099560	3102560	Like they're not across a chasm or anything.
3102560	3103560	Like you could walk up to it.
3103560	3106560	But we're worried about this on the other side of them,
3106560	3107560	like a trap or something.
3107560	3109560	Like something, I got you.
3109560	3112560	Like something like a trap that could be cut and destroyed with a sword.
3112560	3113560	Yeah.
3113560	3114560	Well, I have trap sense.
3114560	3115560	That's true.
3115560	3117560	I sense traps.
3117560	3118560	You sense no traps.
3118560	3119560	Yeah.
3119560	3120560	And?
3120560	3121560	And there's no traps.
3122560	3124560	I walked through the middle portal.
3124560	3125560	Nice.
3125560	3129560	This passage has a high ceiling from which is hanging a large,
3129560	3133560	shiny, vain-looking sack of flesh in the shape of a kidney bean.
3133560	3138560	Several arteries run from various walls into the dangling organ.
3138560	3142560	A huge central cord seems to be its main support for coming down from the ceiling.
3142560	3146560	You can also see what appear to be blue-white sparks of light with multiple
3146560	3150560	arcing limbs crawling to and fro across the surface of the organ.
3151560	3158560	I ask Ballas if he'll follow me through the left butt...
3158560	3160560	What are the two...
3161560	3162560	Pucker thing.
3162560	3163560	Yeah.
3163560	3164560	I don't know.
3164560	3166560	I'm stammering more than usual.
3166560	3169560	I explain that to him that I don't...
3170560	3176560	I stammer sometimes and then I take him through the left one.
3176560	3177560	Hey, man.
3177560	3178560	I'm a swordsman.
3178560	3179560	I'm not a speech coach.
3179560	3180560	Let's go.
3180560	3181560	I'm not.
3181560	3182560	I'm not.
3182560	3183560	I'm not.
3183560	3184560	I'm not.
3184560	3185560	I wasn't fishing for anything.
3185560	3186560	And I'm not.
3186560	3187560	I'm just explaining that I'm not.
3187560	3188560	Are you a finna-fishing for something?
3188560	3193560	Sweetie, go through the right door.
3193560	3196560	Because if we're going to take this thing out, we're going to have to kill its organs.
3196560	3197560	I say all at once, you know?
3197560	3198560	I think that's a good idea.
3198560	3201560	I will go through the right door.
3201560	3205560	I'm looking at a thing that's a kidney bean, so that's probably the kidney, right?
3205560	3206560	Kidney bean.
3206560	3207560	I'm looking at the kidney.
3207560	3209560	It's an infinna kidney.
3209560	3211560	An infinna.
3211560	3213560	An infinna.
3213560	3214560	Nice.
3214560	3218560	Guys, we're like a family.
3218560	3219560	Let's all split up.
3219560	3220560	Let's attack each organ.
3220560	3224560	Let's all go in through different portals at once.
3224560	3226560	And it will each attack the organ.
3226560	3227560	That's what I'm saying.
3227560	3228560	I'm going through the left one with valence.
3228560	3229560	I got the kidney.
3229560	3230560	So you go through the left portal?
3230560	3232560	What do you see in there?
3232560	3234560	Let's see here.
3235560	3240560	This area is more covered in veins and arteries than other rooms.
3240560	3244560	Above you is an intricate lattice of pinkish fibers and rope-like strands.
3244560	3249560	The lattice starts about 30 feet above your heads, and the walls are pale pink, spiderweb,
3249560	3251560	with a delicate filigree of the veins.
3251560	3255560	There are no exits, but above you, the whooshing of gases can be heard.
3255560	3259560	You occasionally see a flash of blue-white sparks far overhead.
3259560	3260560	That's the lungs, right?
3260560	3261560	That's got to be the lungs, baby.
3261560	3262560	Yeah.
3262560	3263560	So I got the kidney.
3263560	3264560	You got the lungs.
3264560	3267560	Mulrann, go into the right portal.
3267560	3270560	Yes, sir.
3270560	3272560	I go into the right portal.
3272560	3278560	Four slippery slopes flamethrower you, stretching down through inky blackness several hundred feet.
3278560	3279560	Shh.
3279560	3280560	Found the balls.
3280560	3286560	You think that you can pick one of these, but you shouldn't be able to climb up too easily.
3287560	3290560	It's like a water world or something.
3290560	3292560	You know, like slides.
3292560	3293560	Oh.
3293560	3294560	Like water slides.
3294560	3296560	Not like water world.
3296560	3298560	All right.
3298560	3302560	Not like the movie, like the knockoff park.
3302560	3304560	There was a park called water world?
3304560	3305560	Yeah, man.
3305560	3308560	What are the odds that there wasn't a park called water world?
3308560	3310560	Like, I'm just saying.
3310560	3313560	The perfect proof isn't on me, okay?
3317560	3318560	All right.
3318560	3319560	So I'm in the kidney room.
3319560	3321560	Yeah, you are.
3321560	3326560	How far is that sack of kidney being shaped hanging above me?
3326560	3328560	I'd say it's a couple feet ahead.
3328560	3329560	All right.
3329560	3332560	So I attack it with my...
3332560	3333560	Figure.
3333560	3335560	With my...
3335560	3337560	Water sword!
3337560	3338560	Flaming sword!
3338560	3340560	Flaming sword attack.
3340560	3342560	You strike the surface of the...
3342560	3344560	The kidney being apparently.
3344560	3347560	Scoring a huge slice across its surface.
3347560	3350560	It's then that you see the white and blue sparks approach.
3350560	3353560	Quickly they knit it back together, healing it.
3355560	3358560	That's why it's not called a temporary fish.
3362560	3363560	Yeah.
3366560	3368560	Is it my turner?
3368560	3369560	Yeah.
3369560	3370560	So you went south.
3370560	3371560	Yeah, you went south.
3371560	3373560	Can I punch up that joke?
3373560	3374560	Go ahead.
3374560	3377560	That's why they don't call it a finny fish.
3377560	3379560	Because it's finite.
3379560	3380560	Finite.
3380560	3381560	Yeah.
3381560	3382560	A finite fish.
3382560	3383560	Yeah.
3384560	3386560	You know what, Madison?
3388560	3391560	I love your donuts.
3397560	3402560	There's just four slopes that go downward in different directions.
3402560	3405560	I'm gonna go for it.
3405560	3409560	I have a great sense of adventure.
3410560	3413560	So I jump down.
3413560	3416560	I close my eyes and I just jump.
3416560	3417560	Randomly?
3417560	3418560	Yeah.
3418560	3419560	Adventure!
3422560	3426560	Speeding down the slippery slope, you find yourself on a cushy landing.
3427560	3430560	There appears to be a puddle of slime on the floor.
3430560	3434560	And a small spot that looks like a pulsating sphincter nearby.
3434560	3436560	Oh, gosh.
3437560	3439560	You're by the butthole probably.
3439560	3440560	Yeah.
3442560	3444560	You guys gotta see this!
3444560	3447560	You're several hundred feet and a meek curtain away.
3450560	3452560	Should we all go back out to the butthole?
3452560	3454560	We should all get back out there, right?
3454560	3456560	You don't even know that happened.
3456560	3458560	Did they hear me if I call up to them?
3458560	3459560	No.
3459560	3461560	I mean, you just did and they didn't, so.
3461560	3462560	Oh, okay.
3462560	3463560	What does it say?
3463560	3465560	Silver Staff of Sylva?
3465560	3466560	Yeah, Sylva.
3466560	3469560	Do you remember that thing that you climbed up out of the hatch with?
3469560	3470560	Alright, alright.
3470560	3473560	Yeah, so it's a long pole.
3473560	3476560	You learn that if you tap it against something, it gets longer.
3476560	3479560	And there's a button that you can press on it.
3479560	3481560	You don't know what it does.
3483560	3484560	Press that button.
3484560	3486560	I pressed the button.
3486560	3487560	It gets stuck.
3487560	3488560	What do you mean it gets stuck?
3488560	3489560	It gets stuck.
3489560	3490560	Oh, the button does?
3490560	3491560	Try to unstick it.
3491560	3493560	I tapped the staff on it.
3493560	3494560	It's stuck.
3494560	3497560	I tried to unstick it.
3497560	3498560	It can't.
3498560	3499560	It's stuck.
3499560	3501560	You just said try to unstick it.
3501560	3502560	Yeah.
3502560	3503560	Try to unstick it.
3503560	3505560	Stop telling me what to do if it's not gonna...
3505560	3507560	You're like a bully.
3507560	3509560	Wait, I'm not hitting you.
3509560	3511560	I'm not hitting you.
3511560	3512560	What's he doing?
3512560	3513560	I'm sorry.
3513560	3514560	The button's not stuck.
3514560	3515560	Try to unstick it.
3515560	3517560	The stick is stuck.
3519560	3520560	Stuck in what?
3520560	3523560	Stuck in wherever you had it last.
3523560	3525560	You just can't move it.
3526560	3527560	Because it's stuck.
3527560	3528560	Because it...
3528560	3529560	Is the button stuck or the stick?
3529560	3530560	No, the stick is stuck.
3530560	3531560	The button's not stuck.
3531560	3532560	Unstick the stick.
3532560	3533560	All right, so I pushed the button.
3533560	3535560	It becomes unstuck.
3535560	3546560	I can't get a read on this audience, but I like it.
3546560	3548560	Yeah, I can't figure it out.
3548560	3550560	Yeah, I dig it.
3550560	3551560	Well, that was...
3551560	3553560	You know, you just learned something.
3553560	3554560	Did I?
3554560	3555560	Yeah.
3555560	3557560	Okay, well, let me see if I did.
3557560	3562560	I stick the stick into the meat around me.
3562560	3564560	Okay, you do that.
3564560	3570560	And it gets taller, so if you hold on, it'll lift you into the air.
3570560	3574560	All right, I want to reduce it again.
3574560	3575560	Okay.
3575560	3576560	How do I do that?
3576560	3577560	You tap it again.
3577560	3578560	I tap it.
3578560	3579560	There you go.
3579560	3580560	Okay, I push the button.
3580560	3582560	It gets stuck.
3582560	3585560	Your relationship with Spencer has become curiously more paternal.
3585560	3588560	All right, just give me a second here, will you?
3588560	3589560	I unstick...
3589560	3591560	I push the button again.
3591560	3593560	Nice, it gets unstuck.
3593560	3594560	Okay, okay.
3594560	3595560	All right, all right.
3595560	3596560	Okay.
3596560	3597560	All right, wow.
3597560	3598560	It's like a tape measure.
3598560	3599560	Okay.
3599560	3600560	Gotcha.
3600560	3601560	All right.
3601560	3602560	Okay.
3602560	3603560	All right.
3603560	3604560	I can do this.
3604560	3605560	Keep it together.
3605560	3608560	A banner of that exchange, the best gets a free t-shirt.
3608560	3609560	Internet.
3609560	3610560	I want to...
3610560	3615560	I mean, I'm sure it's not my turn anymore because I just did all that bullshit.
3615560	3622560	But, you know, if it were my turn, and I'm not saying it is.
3622560	3628560	But I would rather it not be so I can figure out what I want to do.
3628560	3632560	I take out my emerald dagger and attack the kidneys.
3632560	3634560	You attack the kidneys.
3634560	3635560	Let's see if you hit.
3635560	3639560	Let's see if you do damage.
3639560	3644560	You do seven damage, but again, those sparkles knit the wound.
3644560	3645560	Ah, fuck.
3645560	3648560	The sparks crawl across the wound, mending it.
3648560	3651560	The sparks then approach you with menace.
3651560	3652560	Uh-oh.
3652560	3654560	They miss.
3654560	3656560	Thank God for that.
3656560	3657560	I know what I want to do.
3657560	3658560	All right.
3658560	3659560	Summon monster two.
3659560	3660560	Okay.
3660560	3662560	I want to summon my squid.
3662560	3663560	Okay.
3663560	3665560	Can I control what the squid does?
3665560	3666560	Can I kind of like...
3666560	3667560	Yeah.
3667560	3672560	I tell the squid, grab all those lungs and squeeze them.
3672560	3675560	Squeeze those lungs, Albert.
3676560	3678560	Albert, the squid?
3678560	3680560	There are no lungs.
3680560	3683560	There might be lungs far above you, but not...
3683560	3686560	Squeeze those alveoli.
3686560	3687560	Squeeze those arteries.
3687560	3689560	Things that Spencer described.
3689560	3691560	The squid fails to reach them.
3691560	3693560	They're too far overhead.
3693560	3696560	I press the button on the squid.
3698560	3700560	Nothing happens.
3701560	3703560	Painted.
3703560	3706560	Different squid, guys.
3706560	3708560	Sorry, someone just asked a question.
3708560	3710560	Yeah, I heard the question.
3710560	3711560	All right.
3711560	3714560	Well, I put the staff...
3714560	3715560	Okay, I tap it.
3715560	3717560	I'm going to climb up there.
3719560	3720560	You're now in the lattice.
3720560	3723560	You could climb it easily as if it were a ladder.
3723560	3724560	I do so.
3724560	3727560	You climb it easily as if it were a ladder.
3728560	3729560	Ah.
3729560	3732560	My favorite thing about Spencer is how bored he seems.
3732560	3733560	I'm not bored.
3733560	3734560	I know you're not.
3734560	3735560	I know you're not.
3735560	3737560	Yeah.
3737560	3740560	You can see the flashes of light get closer and brighter.
3740560	3743560	Darting to and fro across the strands,
3743560	3747560	you can make out the spidery figures composed of bright light or some sort of energy.
3747560	3748560	Oh, shit.
3748560	3750560	The figures speed up as you get closer.
3750560	3755560	You can see at the heart of this webby mashes a large, thin wall of membrane,
3755560	3757560	behind which a bright glow is cast.
3757560	3761560	You hear the whooshing of gas exchange, respiration.
3761560	3764560	The membrane expands and contracts rhythmically.
3764560	3765560	That's the lungs.
3765560	3770560	And I can't reach that from here, but I bet a guy with a far sword power could.
3770560	3774560	I leave the kidney room and join Sharpie in the lung room.
3774560	3775560	That'd be too convenient.
3775560	3777560	You don't know that he needs you.
3777560	3779560	Yeah, but he's not doing it for that reason.
3779560	3781560	He's doing it because he owes me $5.
3781560	3782560	Yeah.
3783560	3787560	I get lonely and I leave the kidney room and I call out to Sharpie.
3787560	3789560	Flash back to yesterday.
3789560	3791560	Hey, can I borrow five bucks?
3791560	3793560	Yeah, but I want it back.
3793560	3795560	You always fucking forget about it.
3795560	3797560	Look, if we get separated, I'll fucking find you.
3797560	3798560	All right.
3798560	3799560	But I'm serious.
3799560	3801560	No matter what, no matter what, I don't care what's going on.
3801560	3804560	I want you immediately 24 hours from now to Sharpie me.
3804560	3806560	You're beating my $5 back.
3806560	3807560	You're being an asshole.
3807560	3808560	Can you blame me?
3808560	3810560	Neither borrower or lender be.
3810560	3811560	Well, do you want me to follow that?
3811560	3813560	I need five bucks back.
3813560	3814560	Fine.
3814560	3815560	Swear to God.
3815560	3816560	Swear to fucking God.
3816560	3817560	Okay.
3817560	3818560	What God?
3818560	3820560	It's three.
3820560	3821560	Okay.
3821560	3822560	I swear to all three Gods.
3822560	3825560	If I ever get separated from you and I owe you the five bucks.
3825560	3826560	Blah, blah, blah.
3826560	3827560	Flash forward.
3827560	3828560	Yeah, I'll take it.
3828560	3829560	All right.
3833560	3835560	Remembering that I owe Sharpie $5,
3835560	3839560	I leave the kidney room and climb back through whatever meat curtain
3839560	3841560	or whatever portal I went through.
3841560	3844560	You don't know what meat curtain Sharpie's behind.
3844560	3845560	Shit.
3845560	3848560	I go through the left portal.
3848560	3849560	All right.
3849560	3851560	Great guess.
3851560	3852560	I remember.
3852560	3853560	Who's in the left room?
3853560	3854560	30 feet overhead.
3854560	3857560	You see a pink mesh lattice of strands of some sort.
3857560	3861560	I use my climb ability to climb up the lattice.
3861560	3862560	Nope.
3862560	3863560	What?
3863560	3865560	Attempting to scale the wall.
3865560	3866560	You fail miserably.
3866560	3868560	Sharpie!
3868560	3869560	Well, isn't the staff still?
3869560	3870560	Yeah.
3870560	3872560	You can see a silver staff reaching up to the...
3872560	3875560	I tapped the staff.
3875560	3876560	No, don't take...
3876560	3878560	It's stuck, right?
3878560	3880560	I think it's just there.
3880560	3882560	I climb up the staff.
3882560	3884560	You climb up the staff.
3884560	3890560	Above you, you see the unprotected loins of a roped figure.
3890560	3902560	Sharpie, your loins are hanging out.
3902560	3906560	Well, they don't do a lot else.
3906560	3907560	All right.
3907560	3908560	Here's the five I owe you.
3908560	3909560	Oh, Jesus Christ.
3909560	3910560	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3910560	3911560	That's not good.
3911560	3912560	All right.
3912560	3916560	I use my far sword ability to slash at the lungs.
3916560	3919560	Calling upon your training and harnessing your rage.
3919560	3922560	Grant us your sword with much vigor and expertise.
3922560	3928560	With one clean stroke, you make a burst of wind emanate forth from your sword.
3928560	3930560	A large slash appears in the membrane.
3930560	3933560	You feel like you might be able to crawl through it.
3933560	3934560	I crawl through it?
3934560	3935560	You crawl through it.
3935560	3938560	You're inside of what seems to be a large spherical chamber.
3938560	3942560	There's holes in the ceiling and through those holes you hear a gurgling noise
3942560	3946560	before a large blob of snot drops onto the floor before you.
3946560	3950560	It arranges itself into a spider-like form.
3950560	3952560	You see blades appear on its limbs.
3952560	3953560	Jesus.
3953560	3955560	It looks ready to anger fight.
3955560	3956560	Sharpie, get in here.
3956560	3958560	I go through the membrane.
3958560	3959560	All right.
3959560	3960560	That happens.
3960560	3962560	Meanwhile, by the sphincter.
3962560	3963560	Yeah.
3963560	3965560	So there's a puddle of slime in that sphincter.
3965560	3970560	I tie some of my rope to an arrow.
3970560	3971560	Okay.
3972560	3976560	And I shoot the arrow up the slide from whence I came.
3976560	3979560	You can't shoot that far.
3979560	3982560	But I try really hard.
3982560	3984560	Or I shoot half as far.
3984560	3985560	Can I get like half the way up?
3985560	3988560	You can get half the way up.
3988560	3994560	I go half the way.
3994560	3997560	Yep.
3998560	4001560	And I shoot another arrow to get the other way, the other half up.
4001560	4006560	While I'm doing this, I'm longing for Sharpie.
4006560	4013560	I'm imagining that maybe Quark came across as loins and I'm jealous.
4013560	4018560	With a sense of partial embarrassment and jealousy, you fire your arrow.
4018560	4023560	It gets you towards the top of that ledge we were talking about.
4023560	4024560	All right.
4024560	4035560	By the way, for podcast listeners, my best high school friend Dave Frito has been sitting up for the entire time.
4035560	4041560	David, as somebody who has known Dan for a very long time,
4041560	4051560	what advice do you have to my character that's trying to seduce him?
4051560	4059560	From a character perspective, it's a good question.
4059560	4062560	You can try a...
4062560	4064560	A color of submission.
4064560	4066560	No, it's not the power of submission.
4066560	4067560	But in some sense it is.
4067560	4070560	You have to give it to his crazy ideas.
4070560	4073560	So any of the wacky, goofy concepts that he's going to bring up,
4073560	4076560	and if you can just simply follow and support on that,
4076560	4080560	that's generally how it works best for Sharpie.
4080560	4081560	Thank you.
4081560	4085560	So where are we at right now?
4085560	4088560	Dan and I are inside the lung thing.
4088560	4090560	And she's inside the bundle?
4090560	4091560	We don't know what.
4091560	4093560	You're back in the main room now.
4093560	4094560	She's back in the main room.
4094560	4097560	And she was aware of where Dan went.
4097560	4098560	All right.
4098560	4099560	Can she rejoin us?
4099560	4100560	Blue, she's there.
4100560	4101560	Okay.
4101560	4102560	Poof.
4102560	4103560	So we're all in the lungs right now.
4103560	4104560	Yep.
4104560	4105560	All right.
4105560	4106560	Cliffhanger.
4106560	4107560	Cliffhanger!
4107560	4108560	Cliffhanger!
4109560	4111560	Spence, everybody.
4114560	4115560	Aaron McGathey.
4117560	4119560	And let's please thank Dave Friedel for sitting up here
4119560	4121560	showing you his severed toe.
4122560	4123560	Dave Friedel.
4124560	4129560	And for setting me down the path that led me here
4129560	4131560	to playing Dungeons & Dragons with you.
4133560	4136560	Because the truth is I bought that Dungeons & Dragons shirt
4136560	4137560	that Dave saw.
4137560	4140560	But I actually like I just bought it because I thought it was cool.
4140560	4143560	And I wanted to seem like a guy that played Dungeons & Dragons.
4144560	4145560	I bought it.
4145560	4147560	I think I went to Gen Con and bought it.
4149560	4150560	All right.
4150560	4153560	We got to wrap things up for better or for worse.
4153560	4154560	Yeah.
4154560	4155560	I know.
4155560	4156560	I know.
4156560	4159560	We were told to get out of here like 930 or something.
4159560	4160560	Yeah.
4160560	4162560	I mean, we got to be off quicker than that
4162560	4166560	because they got to mop the stage for...
4167560	4170560	Dan, you wrap things up.
4170560	4171560	That was a W.
4171560	4172560	It was an R-A-P.
4172560	4173560	Wrap things up.
4173560	4174560	All right.
4174560	4175560	You're from here.
4175560	4179560	Dan, we came to Madison, Milwaukee's only like an hour away.
4179560	4180560	Yeah.
4180560	4183560	And we didn't meet your family.
4183560	4184560	Bones didn't come.
4184560	4186560	Your mom and dad didn't come.
4187560	4188560	We don't get along.
4189560	4192560	My brother's still mad because I read his emails.
4192560	4194560	I had Adam Goldberg read his emails.
4194560	4202560	And, you know, he wrote me even more hilarious emails about how mad he was about it.
4202560	4210560	And I didn't read them because, you know, he's stupid.
4210560	4213560	And he's overly dramatic.
4213560	4215560	And he's five years older than me.
4215560	4221560	And he should be a big brother to me and say,
4221560	4222560	you can do whatever you want.
4222560	4223560	You're my little brother.
4223560	4225560	But instead, he's a big knob.
4226560	4228560	And if you love your brother...
4228560	4233560	Is it weird for you to come back to Wisconsin and not touch base at all with your family?
4233560	4236560	They're only an hour away and you rarely see them.
4236560	4239560	What was the last time you saw your brother?
4239560	4241560	I don't know.
4241560	4243560	Well, I think it was like...
4243560	4246560	I think I came up for his wedding to Milwaukee.
4246560	4248560	And he was going to get married.
4248560	4251560	And then I had a big fight with him the night before his wedding.
4251560	4254560	So then I just went to the zoo with my girlfriend and went home.
4256560	4258560	I don't like him.
4260560	4262560	And he doesn't like me.
4262560	4265560	We can't be together without fighting, you know.
4265560	4267560	Do you think you'll never...
4267560	4270560	As you get older, you'll never be friends with him again?
4270560	4275560	We've gone through periods where several years go by and it's like we're cool with each other.
4275560	4278560	Because he has his business.
4278560	4280560	We overlap with interests.
4280560	4284560	We were both into computer modeling for a while.
4284560	4291560	But it's a relationship dependent on a lot of time and space between receptors.
4291560	4293560	Anytime it gets...
4293560	4297560	It's hard for me to not piss him off in some way.
4298560	4300560	How about your mom and dad?
4300560	4302560	They're in Florida.
4302560	4304560	They're in Florida.
4304560	4306560	Is your grandpa still alive?
4306560	4307560	Which grandpa?
4307560	4308560	Guadalcanal.
4308560	4309560	No.
4309560	4311560	He died of a jasima.
4311560	4312560	What's that?
4312560	4314560	Yay, Guadalcanal.
4314560	4315560	Yay, Guadalcanal?
4315560	4318560	You're cheering the battle of Guadalcanal?
4318560	4320560	I'm cheering the service.
4320560	4321560	I'm cheering the service.
4321560	4322560	Oh, you're cheering the...
4322560	4323560	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4323560	4327560	Both of my grandpas on my mom and dad's side were biological grandpas.
4327560	4330560	They were both hardcore World War II guys.
4330560	4332560	They both fought in different theaters.
4332560	4334560	I can't remember.
4334560	4336560	One was the majestic.
4336560	4341560	I think my grandpa on my mom's side was at Guadalcanal and never talked about it.
4341560	4345560	And then my grandpa on my dad's side...
4345560	4349560	I think he was in Europe, but I can't remember actually.
4349560	4352560	He was somewhere badass.
4352560	4356560	Yeah, and then I did improv and wrote Monster House.
4356560	4360560	So we all contributed to freedom.
4360560	4364560	Also, I complain about the government not stopping.
4364560	4366560	I complain about paying taxes.
4366560	4368560	But you know what?
4368560	4373560	I never really realized what sacrifice meant until I came to Madison.
4373560	4393560	As I close down the show, I wonder how to grow in Harbontown.
4393560	4396560	My heart is a flower.
4396560	4399560	Every minute's an hour.
4400560	4403560	That doesn't make sense.
4403560	4407560	But we've all been in Harbontown.
4407560	4409560	I thought you were interrupting, but you were just back.
4409560	4410560	Harbontown.
4410560	4411560	Sorry, I got a little upset.
4411560	4412560	Hello.
4412560	4413560	Harbontown.
4413560	4414560	Jeff, I'm going to miss you.
4414560	4415560	You're going to leave for a couple of shows.
4415560	4418560	I'm gone for two days, for two shows.
4418560	4422560	I have to go do shows with Greg Pribbs and Ryan Stiles in Washington.
4422560	4424560	And you're going to be on your own.
4424560	4427560	Aaron McGathey is going to be sitting where I'm sitting right now.
4428560	4430560	And it'll be a whole different kind of show.
4433560	4435560	I'm going to miss you, Jeff.
4435560	4437560	I'm going to miss you, too.
4437560	4444560	I'm going to miss you so much in Harbontown.
4444560	4447560	Where P is yellow and Poop is brown.
4447560	4450560	When I first met you, Poop is brown.
4450560	4454560	Back in LA, you had some goop in your hand.
4454560	4456560	And you said, what's this?
4456560	4458560	And I said, it's love.
4458560	4461560	You should be wearing a glove.
4461560	4464560	Because it probably has germs in it.
4464560	4468560	Or at least microscopic worms in it.
4468560	4471560	In any case, just put it down and let's drink.
4471560	4472560	And so you did.
4472560	4474560	Oh, and we should tell them where we're going after the show.
4474560	4477560	We're going to go to the Great Dane Bar.
4477560	4480560	I think across the street, so it's not that far.
4480560	4484560	I'll have beers and Dan will sign your shirt.
4484560	4488560	Dan will sign your shirt because Dan has a fraud complex.
4488560	4490560	Dan, it won't be gone very long.
4490560	4494560	I'll be back when we get to, I think Salt Lake City
4494560	4499560	and Erin McGathey is throwing swag to the crowd.
4499560	4503560	She doesn't throw it very far.
4503560	4506560	Sometimes it only flies right into the first row.
4508560	4509560	What's your name?
4509560	4510560	Alex.
4510560	4511560	Wow.
4511560	4512560	Alex.
4512560	4513560	What a name.
4513560	4516560	Now I'm making a song about Alex.
4516560	4517560	No, I'm not.
4517560	4518560	What's your name?
4518560	4519560	Andrew.
4519560	4521560	Andrew, I'm making a song.
4521560	4522560	No, I'm not.
4522560	4523560	What's your name?
4523560	4524560	Joey.
4524560	4526560	Joey's got a sweater on.
4526560	4532560	In Heartland Town.
4532560	4534560	Heartland Town.
4534560	4535560	In your butt.
4535560	4536560	In your butt.
4536560	4538560	Because your mama's a slut.
4538560	4539560	No, she's not.
4539560	4540560	I'm so sorry.
4540560	4542560	It just goes to that place where you're...
4542560	4545560	Dan, I have a question for you.
4545560	4548560	I'm going to be away for a day or two.
4548560	4549560	Oh, no.
4549560	4553560	What are you going to do when I'm gone without me?
4553560	4556560	I'm going to pee in this guy's mouth.
4556560	4557560	What's your name?
4557560	4558560	Zach.
4558560	4560560	I'm going to pee in Zach's mouth.
4560560	4561560	That's not enough.
4561560	4563560	You can't just pee in Guy's mouth while I'm gone.
4563560	4564560	Sorry, Zach.
4564560	4566560	I'm not going to pee in your mouth, Zach.
4566560	4567560	What's your favorite food?
4567560	4568560	Pizza.
4568560	4570560	I'm going to give Zach a pizza.
4570560	4571560	I don't know.
4571560	4578560	I mean, is that enough?
4578560	4579560	Jeff, Jeff, come on.
4579560	4580560	Wrap it up.
4580560	4581560	Give me a rap beat.
4581560	4582560	Rap beat?
4582560	4583560	You want a rap beat?
4583560	4585560	This is not a fucking gentle crowd.
4585560	4586560	We don't have to get fucking hardcore.
4586560	4593560	Fucking finish this thing off.
4593560	4594560	Yeah.
4594560	4595560	Yeah.
4595560	4596560	No, no.
4596560	4599560	I'm going to do the Eminem one so they can do the little Rihanna hook.
4599560	4605560	That'll make them feel like they got their money's worth.
4605560	4606560	The suckers.
4606560	4607560	I'm P.T.
4607560	4608560	Barnum.
4608560	4609560	Yo.
4609560	4610560	Yo.
4610560	4611560	Yo.
4611560	4612560	Yo.
4612560	4613560	Mad Town.
4613560	4615560	You've got my feet on the ground.
4615560	4616560	Yo.
4616560	4617560	Yo.
4617560	4618560	Going to rap.
4618560	4619560	Going to be badass.
4619560	4622560	Not going to be bad.
4622560	4623560	I went to Madison now.
4623560	4625560	I fucked your mama like a cow.
4625560	4627560	It's in the pasture and how.
4627560	4630560	I grabbed her titties like two udders and shuttered and said,
4630560	4633560	give me the milk and then I'll make butter with her.
4633560	4635560	I'm going to put it in a bowl and eat it down.
4635560	4639560	I'm going to fuck your mama's pussy and use her titties to make butter.
4639560	4643560	I've already been over that.
4643560	4645560	Just give me a second, but now do the refrain.
4645560	4648560	Come on down to Harman Town.
4648560	4651560	Turn that frown upside down.
4651560	4654560	Butter is yellow poop is brown.
4654560	4655560	Dairy.
4655560	4657560	Come down to Harman Town.
4657560	4660560	Dairy farmers from lake to lake.
4660560	4662560	Madison ain't like that though.
4662560	4664560	They like shit like steak.
4664560	4666560	They like to eat it with potatoes.
4666560	4669560	I heard your mama's titties look like Kato.
4669560	4670560	Caitlin.
4670560	4672560	Staying in a guest house.
4672560	4677560	Creeping like a mouse while a murderer happens in the background.
4677560	4679560	Thank you for coming to Harman Town tonight, you guys.
4679560	4680560	It's time to go.
4680560	4682560	Dan Harman one more time.
4682560	4703560	I'm Jeff Davis, Dan McGathey, Dave Reil, Bob Orfus.
4703560	4705560	All of you who have this out.
4705560	4708560	Sliding on my back, rapping from upside down.
4708560	4711560	I fucked your mama so hard she was a clown.
4711560	4712560	Fucked her in her eyes.
4712560	4714560	Fucked her in her nose.
4714560	4716560	Fucked your mama till she started to grill.
4716560	4717560	We got the light, Dan.
4717560	4719560	Fucked your mama and I got the light.
4719560	4720560	It's time to go, Dan.
4720560	4722560	I'm doing too long a show tonight.
4722560	4723560	It's time to go.
4723560	4725560	I fucked your mama like Bingo.
4725560	4726560	It's time to go.
4726560	4728560	I fucked your mama like Ringo.
4728560	4729560	Yeah.
4729560	4730560	I fucked you.
