701480	706800	new games old games it's actually really nice to pull out all of my old video
706800	710680	game systems I pulled out my old Dreamcast for a recent episode that
710680	715120	hasn't been released yet oh and I was I saw the Instagram you follow Heather in
715120	719400	on Instagram like you'll get intimidated cuz you'll you'll like post like a photo
719400	725680	of like a fucking engine also that like like do you do you wrench on cars and
725680	735880	shit uh no I have a problematic car and I try to take care of it I've learned
735880	743680	how to so I drive a 1978 Datsun 280z come on T tops folks come on give it up
743680	750240	come on he looks upset but it's like I reached out I saw that when you when you
750240	756920	posted it I was like it's amazing thank you I sealed over this is gonna break
756920	762160	your heart I had the sunroof patched it's all right okay you're right she
762160	770800	made it an otop is that cool but so the car has a fuel injection system so the
770800	775560	lines go over the top of the engine and one day I started it and gasoline
775560	780320	sprayed all over my windshield and it was terrifying because that means I
780320	787080	could die so I've learned how to fix that problem so that that is the only
787080	790680	wrenching that I do on my engine and the rest of the time I usually have it towed
790680	796160	still but in that in that three sentences about you doing something
796160	800200	wrong with a car I was like oh you would have bullied me in high school no
800320	806440	cuz you're like brave enough to oh no fucking turn the key or whatever like
806440	810000	it just seems like you know your way around no we would have been loser
810000	813600	friends really yeah like what were you in high school what was your archetype I
813600	823680	was um a Dragon Lance nerd so I used to what yeah sorry general enthusiasm yeah
823680	829840	I I read a lot of Dragon Lance and I played D&D with a guy who would draw
829840	839520	his maps on lambskin he also had a full suit of armor so he was like a rich
839520	847680	kid but like a like a not you know what I mean so yeah I did I did I did that
847680	853360	okay so there's no guy I mean how big was your high school like how many so my
853360	859080	high school is 400 kids total and it was not a good it was not a good place I
859080	864640	hated it very much 400 kids means that there's a there's a social allowance for
864640	870560	one art art kid yeah yeah we had one art kid in our and it was not me it was not
870560	875920	you the D&D I was the D&D video game kid so it's hard to be the D&D video game
875920	880920	kid when there's only one allowed wait the truth is you know that you really
880920	885600	want another D&D kid the guy who the guy who drew on the maps he was from a
885600	889000	different school so you're totally right like he did not they what there was no
889000	893440	community of nerds that way I spent so much time in middle school being into
893440	901520	D&D it never played it like I literally like my whole identity was I just I had
901520	906880	three D&D shirts that I bought at Gen Con because I lived in Milwaukee so I
906880	912520	was I was Gen Con adjacent and like I I bought I bought these D&D sweatshirts
912520	919080	there and I just wore those I alternated between them and I I had these
919080	924240	a D&D books but I didn't play with anybody I would say that was just my
924240	930040	identity it was just me saying step off or you've already stepped off and it was
930040	934800	my idea first like like it was just it was but it was it was almost just as
934800	938880	satisfying like I I don't know I spent so much of it but then in high school I
938880	943800	I thank God I had a 600 student high school that I transferred to and that
943800	949920	meant that there were three nerds allowed and they found me and I my
949920	953360	brain blossomed because we would get to I met these guys and we would get
953360	959520	together and play D&D for from 3 to 9 p.m. that's that's great that's
959520	964400	heartwarming but you did that with by the way thank you for letting me be a
964400	970400	guest on your show oh yeah I have any other questions for me on this Dungeons
970400	975400	and Dragons sweatshirt it was all the there were black sweatshirts and they
975400	980200	were just the the illustrations from the covers of the second edition ad or not
980200	986560	not oh hell yeah that's really fucking cool that's a badass easily paintings
986560	992060	whatever you know the guy that the cover of unearth arcana the cover of the
992060	994900	dungeon masters guide the cover of the players handbook I think I had those
994900	998220	three sweatshirts that's really I mean that's fucking great they were they were
998220	1003500	they were jet black they were dandruff accentuating it was like a black light
1003500	1010740	on my shoulders everywhere I went just a big dotted sign that said back off buddy
1010740	1019980	back off ladies did it work oh yeah man people gave me space but how do you
1019980	1027780	reconcile being a nerd with being a you seem marketable to me you you're you
1027780	1032460	you went into improv you went into it's not it's not I mean like no it's not you
1032460	1041100	seem like you could have made it well you can pass for like not a nerd yeah
1041100	1045660	but you're fucking harder core than me frankly I sold out as soon as I could
1045660	1049540	like you're you still stick to your guns you like cosplay and like you you
1049540	1055100	you're fucking like it's infused in your life you get joy from our legacy you're
1055100	1059260	you're you think that I should have given up those things no I could I'm a
1059260	1064260	shame that I did oh no you didn't have you you have a show that is those things
1064260	1068940	no it's not listen to this interview it's terrible well I'm just I'm just
1068940	1071740	saying I guess what I'm sorry I'm just circling like like you're such an
1071740	1076580	effervescent person you don't you never sold out you're not you I don't know it's
1076580	1082980	like you you're an island like like that that's what you are and like you do you
1082980	1088260	do you have anxiety about yourself and shit or is it like what I see is what I
1088260	1097540	get right now I am having anxiety you radiate confidence so I'm just yeah I
1097540	1102780	mean are you are you swallowing down insecurity I mean yeah so right the
1102780	1107940	worst the best thing about like be I think about being like an improviser for
1107940	1111860	example is that I don't ever have to be myself I couldn't I can't imagine being
1111860	1118340	like a stand-up and it took a lot of it was a lot of like mental homework to do
1118340	1122380	a podcast because I was like oh over the course of like 20 episodes people are
1122380	1127400	going to figure out who I am and they're gonna hate that person and you know some
1127400	1131320	of the comments have gotten there really quickly and they they're on they
1131320	1136920	know who I am they hate me but the yeah one of the things that you think people
1136920	1140600	are gonna like what what what is that kite tail you carry with you where you're
1140600	1144520	like because I feel that too these people are gonna Google me and they're
1144520	1148140	gonna like pick through and what is it about you that you're worried people are
1148140	1154200	gonna so I wear so much of my my nerd dumb my fandom all of those things on
1154200	1159880	my sleeve but I am always afraid my imposter syndrome manifest says I don't
1159880	1164640	know enough about any of the things that I actually love like when people see
1164640	1168040	that I drive that car and then I fixed it up twice they're like oh she's a
1168040	1172480	gearhead but I'm not a gearhead and you want you're like I'm not gonna stand up
1172480	1175600	to that fucking scrutiny don't ask me a bunch of fucking gearhead questions are
1175600	1179480	you gonna shame me right but the only thing that I feel like I could like go
1179480	1184280	pretty deep on is video games and then even that and that's a forgiving crowd
1184280	1190080	yeah that's a that's a good that's a good pit to dive into people love it when
1190080	1195920	women talk about video games yeah like the more the merrier people hate it so
1195920	1203880	much that it changed politics literally like I mean for real began there yeah
1203920	1212400	anyways but but but you I mean so have you it's just regarding that like in
1212400	1216480	terms of your relationship with like other people's opinions and your
1216480	1221280	identity and stuff are there epiphanies that you've come into over the last five
1221280	1229240	years that you could share with me like just in that general area about like like
1229240	1234880	what people like you're talking about yourself being out there being visible
1234880	1238480	you having an identity people having opinions about it what's your
1238480	1249480	relationship with that how has that changed from 2009 to now um so a decade
1249480	1256200	ago I was writing for video game magazines and there were very vocal I
1256200	1264680	feel like I was I got a trailer for gamergate in the kinds of language that
1264680	1270720	met me when I was a video game journalist there were places that really
1270720	1277880	really ruthlessly called me a dumb cunt and like like diatribes of stuff and I
1277880	1283480	was like oh this is unfamiliar and then after I stopped being a games journalist
1283480	1289040	and sort of disappeared into comedy for the next few years I every time I'd like
1289040	1293760	poke my head up out of that that water and somebody would be like bitch and I'd
1293760	1299600	go back under I'd be like ah that yes I remember so I feel like that I was
1299600	1304800	really lucky to get a preview of it before it came down like sledgehammer on
1304800	1312360	everybody later right um so that would be what I learned is that like I I was
1312360	1319000	very I've always been very internet like I love internet so much I was a I had
1319000	1325880	prodigy like on a black and white screen in my house and like was posting on
1325880	1330680	prodigy forums back in the day like I've always you were trying you had one
1330680	1337760	keyboard under each hand I had a split keyboard I had a Microsoft
1337760	1343320	ergonomic because that's how you I mean like a girl who's like hey mom and dad
1343320	1349480	will you give me an ergonomic keyboard they're like oh no I had as many as I
1349480	1352200	could because I would see a TV and movies that that's if you were a hacker
1352200	1357560	you had more keyboards and more screens were you were you ever a hacker I was a
1357560	1362600	poser hacker I was like a phone phone freak PHRE you know did you make the
1362600	1367240	thing from the like the back of popular mechanics where you got free phone calls
1367240	1370800	was that was phone was that like a whistle or something yeah no I never I
1370800	1377720	wasn't a whistler okay I I was a I was a code I was just I was just seeing finding
1377720	1382120	codes on BBS's and then we'd go like oh this is a code you can type in and then
1382120	1385320	you get you get free long distance awesome and then I would call like sex
1385320	1390680	lines oh just to test it I was like oh for real if you use this code you don't
1390680	1394520	get charged for a 900 number and then like I don't even know if it was true or
1394520	1398360	if my parents are just like oh good he's not gay I don't I don't know I have no
1398360	1403280	idea like but I did the codes did work and I was excited the code just let that
1403280	1407880	person listen in on your conversation but that's not a hacker I didn't hack
1407880	1413760	anything I was a programmer I was very into Commodore 64 basic you know
1413760	1421520	programming I almost said basic cable but anyways um shit like where were we
1421520	1424520	at though we're talking about what we've learned what have you learned in the
1424520	1429160	last 10 years don't get me started that's what this dumb show is all about I
1429160	1433160	was I was curious and you let me know I mean what I got there was an indication
1433160	1440120	of actually like way before like long ago you've dwelt among like environments
1440120	1446000	where you can't please everybody all the time is more than just a comforting
1446000	1451680	platitude if you don't win a competition at school it's like an actual thing you
1451680	1455320	have to live with that that's what you're describing is like you were acid
1455320	1462720	washed and and so is it that as a these many years later are you is there a
1462720	1466680	philosophy that you carry with you where you're like don't don't read the comments
1466680	1472240	or fuck them if they can't take a joke or don't drink the haterate or like what
1472240	1477360	is the I mean is there any guiding philosophy at the risk of giving up my my
1477360	1482640	bit which will then I think make it ineffective is that anytime somebody
1482640	1487160	says something terrible to me online I reply with okay I will do that or yes
1487160	1492840	thank you I agree and usually they're like oh okay like if like if somebody's
1492840	1500560	like you've got a fucking terrible smile which I got on a video comment was
1500560	1504600	like this girl shouldn't fucking smile she's got a terrible smile and I was
1504600	1510320	like I also hate my smile and I wish that I didn't have it and then after
1510320	1517160	that they're like no it's not that bad it does it yeah I see what you mean about
1517160	1521960	like yeah don't give it up because it's like oh god that is the one fear but
1521960	1525400	yeah it makes perfect sense I think I feel like we've all gone through that
1525400	1529040	phase and it's always yielded results and I think I just like my fear is what
1529040	1534080	bumps me off of that path it always works engaging yeah we're no just like
1534080	1539840	being healthy oh just going like like not attacking the person back yeah like
1539840	1545240	like which is just what is that that's exactly just being like either nothing
1545240	1549240	at all or even better like just going like yeah I guess my dick's pretty small
1549760	1554160	and just like letting it take its course which is what a Taoist would do and what
1554160	1560920	water would do it like it always works yeah it does why do we stop doing it
1560920	1564760	cuz I don't know day I don't know I cuz we get super clever and we want to fire
1564760	1569520	back yeah I got good jokes and this is the time to let them fly goddamn right
1569520	1575920	speaking of jokes it's time to bring out professional comedy writer SNL writer
1575920	1582360	alum Rick and Morty writer Nick Rutherford wait please welcome them out
1594400	1602080	you guys both wrote on SNL but not the same year no see different comedy
1602080	1607560	philosophies no we did we did not write at the same time no I got I didn't get
1607560	1611320	hired along with a bunch of my buddies who got hired and then I was working
1611320	1617240	with Heather at the time and she had just gotten fired from it I was not
1617240	1623320	renewed right it's different oh I say I got I was fired yeah I got fired they
1623320	1626600	probably never fire anybody you don't have to fire writers in TV you just
1626600	1631320	don't pick up their option yeah yeah that's what happened yeah yeah well you
1631400	1636400	know feels the same no I wish I was no no I reached the end of my contract yeah
1636400	1643340	yeah and then was fired okay great fired yeah make no mistake you sent fire
1643340	1648520	they sent me a new contract they would just say fired on you to be fired why
1648520	1653240	would they they mailed this this is what an option plus one if we like how like
1653240	1658040	your job of being an ex-employee we may fire you again yeah they didn't like me
1658040	1661120	as an employee as an ex-employee either because they didn't fire me again but
1661200	1665720	you told me a lot of terrible stories that made me feel good about not getting
1665720	1673080	hired and then I got hired and I was like Heather doesn't know shit and then
1673080	1682080	I had a terrible year you guys have suicide dreams there yeah no I have
1682080	1688280	dreams where I just bite people really hard yeah makes me feel good you have a
1688280	1694600	dream that you're the guy being bit no that's working on SNL and then I knew
1694600	1699400	that you were right the whole time thank you yeah and I mean it's not every
1699400	1705080	everybody has a different experience there ours was the same yeah it's weird
1705080	1713840	that the phrase 36th season shouldn't be said along with comedy isn't it 46 well
1713840	1719960	now it probably is yeah it's just like like oh so-and-so worked on the 36th
1719960	1725360	season of a sketch show holy shit I mean it's yeah it's it's its own thing it's
1725360	1729920	more like a sport like there aren't seasons of sports it's a dynasty yeah
1729920	1736760	yeah it's a it's an institution it's fun it's good everybody loves it when
1736760	1741080	they're 10 years old when they turned 17 they're like this sucks now I wonder
1741080	1746480	if that's still trying to get back on this show so if we could move the
1746480	1752200	conversation what are your characters do it you've got the right kind of crowd
1752200	1762120	tonight they're ready to produce SNL here's a here's a guy here's a here I
1762120	1767120	well I just did this impression of a guy who got fired from SNL five years ago
1767120	1772600	and can't stop talking about it all right that's one don't you have a guy
1772600	1775880	named hammerhead yeah of course I got a guy named man I was gonna say yeah
1775880	1781760	cuz you're a trained improviser so and hammerheads like I'm gonna nail you
1781760	1790520	okay someone told me you do an incredible Viola Davis of course and
1790520	1801360	that of course is as we all know the woman who is half violin I thought that
1801360	1805200	people would be more enamored with my lack of knowing who Viola Davis is at
1805200	1811880	least currently I thought it was one of your better pieces thank you no I don't
1811880	1817640	I don't know who that is all right let's go in
1817640	1822760	should I know who that is no wait who is she and maybe I do I'm bad with
1822760	1828800	names a guest to make him feel good no first time I'm nervous I've had vodka
1828800	1833040	I forgot who Viola Davis is it's fine yeah all right thanks man I don't know
1833040	1840160	she's a famous dungeon master whoa we're now I feel bad it's time for our
1840160	1843760	lightning round we're gonna go around round Robin with the guests and talk
1843760	1848040	about their experience with breast cancer we'll start with Heather in thank
1848040	1857480	you but you you recently like like it was it was just fucking like it hit you
1857480	1863080	like a truck I don't want to be crass I didn't see it coming for sure and yeah
1863080	1866560	yeah yeah let Nick let Nick go first no and Heather was diagnosed I wasn't ready
1866560	1878880	for it but like whether we talked about you talked about the fucking brevity of
1878880	1884240	it from start to finish yeah I so I went in for my first my my OBG was like hey
1884240	1888600	you should get a mammogram at some point for like a baseline you know and I was
1888600	1891800	like okay sure and I went in for my first mammogram and they were like oh
1892040	1897680	god this doesn't usually happen yeah yeah the serious doctor came in and like
1897680	1900880	that's what you every time I go to the doctor I'm like oh they're gonna fuck
1900880	1908400	I'm dying for sure I'm dying at the dentist and so they were like well so
1908400	1912680	all of these things these are calcium and usually that forms around a tumor
1912680	1918740	Heather did you work on SNL at all I did I did I did I did work on SNL it was
1918980	1925180	it was as exciting but yeah so they were like you you have stage three breast
1925180	1929700	cancer and I was like three there's only four yeah there's only four four is
1929700	1934660	politely sorry but like it's over a death sentence yeah yeah I mean not over
1934660	1938540	over if you have stage four and you're listening yeah no you're gonna make it
1938540	1941820	if you have stage four there you still can pull completely pull out of it it's
1941820	1948140	kind of like a video game yeah yeah I was playing on difficult but not hard
1948140	1953380	I was not playing on casual or normal but you went in for this thing and
1953380	1958900	they're like it's stage three yeah it was like like there's it was a matter of
1958900	1964660	the minutes until stage four and there's a big difference between stages yes so
1964660	1972660	they so I I went in what on one let's see I went in on a Thursday and by
1972660	1979460	Thursday of the next week I was seeing a surgeon and then last the next I'm
1979460	1982980	like them prepping you yeah like them walking me through all the stuff and
1982980	1987340	and they were like oh you you know we would recommend our double mastectomy and
1987340	1989940	I was like okay great and they were like you don't want to consult and I was like
1989940	1996860	no fuck it let's go fucking cut him off so then they they did and then so less
1996860	2004700	than a month from mammogram to surgery and I had a double mastectomy and then
2004700	2009660	and that was that and I didn't tell anybody ahead of time like I didn't post
2009660	2014220	on Instagram or anything because I didn't I really didn't want anyone to
2014220	2019700	worry and I also didn't want to be identified as the you know as the person
2019700	2026260	who had glad I can help thank you but that was so baller yeah and then so then
2026260	2031700	I got I had it done and the only I think the only truly scary thing there
2031700	2035900	were two scary moments one was I came out of surgery and I didn't feel well
2035900	2039900	and they're like of course you don't feel well and I was like no I really
2039900	2044380	don't feel well and they have like drains that go into your rib cage to
2044380	2049620	drain like all the fluid from what is a hugely traumatic injury to your body and
2049620	2055420	that's the wait what's the it's it's the because you didn't do chemo no no
2055420	2059660	they just have the for the first week two weeks one week after you have the
2059660	2064260	surgery is an injury and your body is like getting up these fluids like I've
2064260	2068580	been traumatized yes so you have these drains that are hanging out of you and
2068580	2073780	one of them was filling up with like really dark red liquid like darker than
2073780	2076780	blood and I was like that can't be right and they're like no it's fine and I said
2076780	2079780	well can we talk to my surgeon and they're like no it's fine and then like
2079780	2082740	an hour and a half later I was like I really don't feel well can we please
2082740	2087620	just for my own mental like well-being get my surgeon back in and she can be
2087620	2094580	like that's fine and she came in and went oh no and I was like we have to we
2094580	2097060	have to bring you back in immediately we have to bring you back you're bleeding
2097060	2101420	internally and so I had to go under again with and that was scary like
2101420	2105820	that's when my dad cried and stuff like that was rough for everyone my
2105820	2109700	girlfriend fainted it was that was scary cuz they were they were like you're
2109700	2113100	not supposed to go under twice in a day and you know if you're bleeding
2113100	2117540	internally it's much worse than cutting off your boobs so that was that was
2117540	2125140	scary and and then I think that was it after that I was fine though when you
2125140	2129540	described it to me you're like January blah blah blah I got the thing and it
2129540	2134580	was like and then you the number of days was like from start to finish yeah
2134580	2139580	January 27th to February 18th was the entirety of my cancer journey that
2139580	2146900	means before you're like zippity-doo job time to have a formal playdate with a
2146900	2152140	mammogram like just to do my due diligence yeah and then boom worst news
2152140	2156820	ever yeah except if we had caught it a little later and then like just this
2156820	2161740	crime like you had this whole spiritual experience that barely anybody
2161740	2166940	listening is gonna have which is like until later well which is like holy
2166940	2172940	shit this might be it yeah and then you come out to the other side and one thing
2172940	2179300	that you said to me was like well that I so a couple women reached out and they
2179300	2182540	were like you know you're gonna be a different person on the other side of
2182540	2186100	this journey and it's gonna be really great to meet that person and so there
2186100	2191220	was a part of me that was like oh this trauma is gonna make me realize
2191220	2197260	something and I got to the other side of it and there was nothing I was the
2197260	2203940	same person and I was like what no there's got okay I'm gonna feel on a
2203940	2208900	daily basis I'm gonna have more gratitude or more like fear and there was
2208900	2216060	nothing it was the same miserable person on the other side just like well fucking
2216060	2222780	get back to work so they didn't get all the cancer no I am the cancer you are
2222780	2227580	the cancer the the breast feel great yeah there's somewhere yeah they're free
2227580	2233180	would you call yourself an atheist would you let yourself yes okay so so the what
2233180	2236340	was your relationship with oblivion so and but the important thing is it didn't
2236340	2240260	change right your relationship was like whatever and then you were kind of
2240260	2244420	surprised to find out on the other side of this I hadn't changed so here's two
2244420	2250820	things that happened during the thing which is my therapist said you should
2250820	2256620	pray and I was like ha ha and she's like no it even if you don't so there are
2256620	2262260	scientific studies that show that prayer works as a healing it like it prayer
2262260	2266380	makes you heal and I was like yeah but I'm pretty sure you have to believe
2266380	2271020	great it's not the actual thing and she's like no you can believe in the
2271020	2278860	study so pray I actually think that's a smart therapist and I was like oh and
2278860	2283340	she's like if you know scientifically it works then you're praying to the
2283340	2290620	results and so for like that month I prayed to the study like I was like and
2290620	2298980	you did do it yeah oh yeah every night I was like you know please study please
2298980	2303220	Harvard Journal of Medicine yeah I wish well she was like you know whatever it
2303220	2308580	is that you want to put as the thing you're praying to and here Toby McGuire
2308580	2318060	yeah I keep spider-manning me through this so I so I prayed to that thing I
2318060	2323900	prayed to like the idea of prayer as a as a as a self is that the right word
2323900	2332260	so yeah yeah um thank you I get a letter a week later I was like it would
2332260	2338060	have been nice if you had all accepted my sentence the other thing was that I
2338060	2343700	got really sad about music was I guess something that changed because I I would
2343700	2347500	a song that would come on that I really loved and I was like man there's a
2347500	2351620	possibility I'm not gonna hear this song more than like five more times oh god
2351620	2355700	and that bummed me out like it of all the thing everything else was okay like
2355700	2361180	I was too stressed out to eat and so I wasn't like manifesting is like oh I
2361180	2365500	should eat my last meal although that did occur to me but then I was like well
2365500	2370340	what but you're telling me that having experienced those things those moments
2370340	2375060	like the the that didn't I mean I'm not I don't want to say that didn't change
2375060	2380100	you I'm saying like like like like but it's like you didn't I don't I don't I
2380100	2383140	don't mean my question to be like what do you what are you some kind of freak
2383140	2386380	I mean you're my hero because it's like when you told me that I'm like oh god
2386380	2391700	you're yeah cuz that's my biggest fear is it is like dying the no the not
2391700	2396780	feeling shit oh the stuff where you go like oh is there somebody like I'm not
2396780	2401820	like this other person this fairy tale story about when I get this and then I
2401820	2405620	overcome that then I'm supposed to feel this and you go like oh that's not me
2405620	2411380	that's not how I'm feeling well maybe maybe it could be that for you you're
2411380	2416420	already living in a way where the thing that most people transform into you've
2416420	2420260	already actualized and that's sort of what I was like I'm like a person
2420260	2439860	because of my diet I mean that's kind of how when I talked to people about it
2439860	2444580	like my therapist I was like you know I was looking forward to this thing and it
2444580	2449180	didn't happen and she was like well you already you talked a lot about death
2449180	2453500	before you got this diagnosis I feel like you lived with it as a presence in
2453500	2458540	your life like you talk about like well I gotta go on this vacation that is a
2458540	2463380	little bit more expensive than I want to because what if I die next week and then
2463380	2467340	I won't have done it so and it was sort of I had a watch for a while called
2467340	2472740	ticker which I got off Kickstarter and it you went online and you filled in all
2472740	2476940	of this stuff about your life and all of your habits and your like heart rate and
2476940	2481860	everything I have seen this and then it counts down from your expected death
2481860	2487780	date whoa and I had that watch until it ran out of batteries did it it couldn't
2487780	2493860	count that there's the watch say you do fill in I've been diagnosed with well
2493860	2497700	you could if I mean like if I went back and filled it out now you could like add
2497700	2505180	a cancer diagnosis to it and it would probably but yeah so I wore that watch a
2505180	2508260	lot and I'd be like well you know that's gonna happen sometime hopefully
2508260	2515740	in 60 years or whatever and and so I should go eat shrimp Rutherford what are
2515740	2524220	your near death what's your relationship with death this I can't I can't follow
2524220	2532260	that man this you don't have to follow it I just open for her next thing go
2532260	2538340	lateral be like here's an impression of Nixon getting fucked a little no mix
2538340	2545340	your way out of that shit I was at my my parents house this weekend are you
2545340	2552980	afraid to die goddamn I don't think I can die that's the problem oh you can
2552980	2559060	and you will oh Jesus this is I this is the for you the worst podcast for the
2559060	2565220	guests and for me I'm being attacked and you're not gonna die I thought I'd
2565220	2571140	come up here and do like voices right or be like meow and they'd be like that
2571140	2575860	sounds like a funny cat and now I'm thinking about things and the audience
2575860	2580540	isn't laughing a lot and what about you Nick what have you struggled with and
2580540	2584500	I'm like I was with my parents for a weekend the audience is thoughtful
2584500	2588820	tonight they've been that way since the beginning it was a little jarring at
2588820	2592020	the top of the show but they're thoughtful they're listening they're
2592020	2595860	sincere they're here for the long haul and they'd like to know if you're afraid
2595860	2606660	of death they don't want your what my ex-girlfriend would call what did she
2606660	2613260	call it def deflection yeah they don't want your deflection we hate that that
2613260	2620020	God oh sorry same no I yeah I don't know if I don't you don't know if you're
2620020	2626740	gonna die I whoa I don't know if I'm kind of confident I don't I don't think
2626740	2630420	about it that's how I deal with death that's great about it that's I do
2630420	2633860	whatever I want to do when I want to do it as long as not hurting somebody then
2633860	2637580	I do that and if I find I've hurt somebody I try to have my best to kill
2637580	2642460	them so they can't tell anybody do you worry about anything happening after you
2642460	2653820	die you know I I think now I'm getting real guys buckle in oh shit I think
2653820	2658780	that there's you just become like a little thing of energy and it like poops
2658780	2662780	into a flower somewhere and maybe you're not aware of that but you're still that
2662780	2667500	flower or you're a worm on another planet or something I don't know all
2667500	2673740	right so that's comforting to me and just a worm or a flower yeah I'll be
2673740	2678300	happy with either of those but I don't have to worry about that cuz uh I'm
2678300	2685820	immune to death baby oh yeah well yeah well I mean I I don't think about it
2685820	2690340	either that's my solution it's great isn't it yeah I don't I can't imagine it
2690340	2698260	nobody wants to I get so mad at my fiance Cody her dog is dying all dogs
2698260	2702500	are dying true we're all dying if you have a dog right now you have
2702500	2707540	subscribed to death all all dogs are dying was the prequel to all dogs are
2707540	2716900	going ahead Cody's subscription is running out and I got mad at Cody today
2716900	2720660	because Cody was upset because the dog like disappeared in the yard and she was
2720660	2726700	like Barbara Barbara where are you and then I just I can't I can't handle Cody
2726700	2732380	handling a dog's death and I keep thinking to myself like Harmon you gotta
2732380	2737500	get your shit together you have chosen a woman you're gonna spend the rest of
2737500	2743380	your life with that means probably you maybe her shouldn't matter one of you is
2743380	2751220	going to watch the other person get sick or wander out into the yard if that
2751220	2757740	if that can't be the definition right lowest fucking bar of my ability to
2757740	2763540	adjust when she's like where's Barbara don't talk to me like that you need to
2763540	2768780	check the whole yard before you go into hysterics this is like election night I
2768780	2776940	told you Hillary was gonna win you didn't believe it I get upset when she's
2776940	2781740	upset and so like like this I like living with a partner were you with a
2781740	2789980	partner when you yes yes I the we was really hard I'm dating this girl Mary and
2789980	2798380	she was woo Mary Mary she's not here she's working she doesn't listen to this
2798380	2809220	show she she was waiting for me when I was getting the mammogram and I was
2809220	2814060	like oh god I've got to be the doctor now and like going in be like I got low
2814060	2821980	and I was like so okay this isn't easy news to say and that was hard but yeah
2821980	2825780	so she was she was incredible she was because there were times where they
2825780	2829420	would like the doctors would be rattling off shit and I'd be like I don't
2829420	2833380	care just tell me what when the appointment is I don't need to know any
2833380	2837980	of the options or any of that and she wrote it all down in a journal and now I
2837980	2841220	have this like journal of like everything said to me during the whole
2841220	2846140	thing she was phenomenal she was unbelievable I don't think I could have
2846140	2851500	done it as well without her and this is the is it is it okay to talk a little
2851500	2857420	bit about this this is the the partner that we we talked about like that that's
2857420	2861140	that relationship right the one that you're still in yes I assume I don't I
2861140	2869020	mean well she's she's you're still in a relationship or no I think she's
2869020	2873300	she's Christian yes she's like and not just Christian like secular Christian
2873300	2887060	like she thinks Jesus is coming back for reals are you Christian I'm half
2887060	2894180	Catholic half Baptist what does that there's a punchline coming no that means
2894180	2899500	my mama told my daddy put the rowboat in the attic my my great-grandfather and my
2899500	2905820	grandfather were Baptist ministers and my mother was this close to being a
2905820	2912820	nun Catholic and I went to Catholic High School okay so are you a believer I am
2912820	2917620	oh okay great because I grew up in a neighborhood a city that was very Jewish
2917620	2923220	and I watched people observe every Saturday and then I observed from like
2923220	2928500	six o'clock in the morning until maybe four o'clock because I had to actually
2928500	2933780	feed people after church hmm so you think Heather's going to hell no because
2933780	2938940	well Baptists are cooler about that I mean it's look it's weight training and
2938940	2948780	then you decide what you want to do come on come on come on I'm spot you bro I'm
2948780	2953100	spotting you faith is a like it's sort of like weed we're like people introduce
2953100	2955940	it to you and then you can pick the strain that you like and how it affects
2955940	2959620	your body and how much you really want to smoke all day you don't have to smoke
2959620	2965460	all day you can smoke at parties methodist makes me sleepy Baptist gives
2965460	2973660	me paranoia unitarian I don't even think excuse me a headache but I love the CBD
2973660	2980340	it's like this is have THC in or no I think that's real I mean that to me not
2980340	2984980	that my opinion fucking matters but that is the actual way to be Christian in
2984980	2988620	which I would actually then like start to merge with that freeway when it's
2988620	2992620	like the Joseph Campbell thing where it's like yeah I don't I don't truck
2992620	2997180	with like what the hierarchy is telling me the alderman of my church or it
2997180	3001980	doesn't go up to any kind of thing so it's like politics were like some of the
3001980	3007380	shit is amazing the good that gets done and then and then it's not some of the
3007380	3011420	shit's garbage actual just straight-up corruption and garbage like I go to
3011420	3016220	church now and the church that I go to was able to get to Haiti before any
3016220	3020700	other relief organization because there were doctors in the church and there
3020700	3025140	were pilots in the church they were able to commandeer x-ray machines and planes
3025140	3030140	and get on the ground first and I do I try to do charity but you sometimes if
3030140	3032820	you really want to do charity you have to join a church because they've got
3032820	3036140	this incredible infrastructure so like if you're trying to save people from New
3036140	3040340	Orleans when the floods happen like the first places that were on the ground and
3040340	3044060	we're able to get supplies out or churches so it sort of comes in handy
3044060	3050060	and there's that prayer thing your partner is like like like she's also a
3050060	3055780	playwright which already Christian playwright like like I'm like she's a
3055780	3061100	playwright and she's a showrunner now she's got a show on Hulu nice she's
3061100	3066220	fucking doing it what's in it can you tell us the name the name is not been
3066220	3070380	announced okay but yeah she's about to move to New York and film it and I'm a
3070380	3077380	misser but my girlfriend survived breast cancer and look at me on Hulu that's
3077380	3082660	the name of the show you told me a backseat that's not do we edit
3082660	3091860	live live to air oh yeah look so are you really angry about the breast cancer
3091860	3095620	thing you look so I'm pissed about it nobody takes my other away from me no
3095620	3098580	he's doing a thing it's like it's like you guys are double-guessed it's not
3098580	3102460	fair I told I told him we're ending the show and at the time I thought we were
3102460	3105700	ending the show end of September and I was like come on come on the show
3105700	3109580	everybody get on the show hurry up Jesus Christ we're ending it and now you're
3109580	3115020	now I'm ending it in December and I love you guys both but yeah no Nick is Nick
3115020	3119420	is sitting in the in the in the less favorable seat and he's like he's he's
3119420	3123580	playing it up like a gentleman like he's kind of going like well I'm not I don't
3123580	3127860	have anything I can't like butt in with my story about Burt Reynolds anything
3127860	3135460	wrong with you whoa no there's nothing right dick is perfect fucking tits are
3135460	3140140	awesome they're firm and great I don't know what I can't relate to this
3140140	3147260	conversation well I just wanted yeah and I I'm fine with that I also Nick's
3147260	3151060	working on Rick and Morty and it's like a wonderful like super fucking cool guy
3151300	3158180	like like like but I also has his own show right now while we're drilled down at this moment though
3158180	3161900	when you're going through this fucking matrix where the bullet is going by you
3161900	3166740	you have a Christian playwright yeah girlfriend yes and I want to just like
3166740	3172220	just they're finish up this thing of like like like this is a two-month story
3172220	3178220	she's there with you she was there she she was like oh let's I'm gonna go get
3178220	3183140	my first mammogram ha ha ha like and then you're coming out from the end of
3183140	3187300	the waiting room and going well that went about as bad as it can go and then
3187300	3194780	she's in a relationship could go from there she so um one of the I boy this is
3194780	3199700	or don't by no I'm not I'm I'm thinking about what a nightmare would be if she's
3199700	3203100	like in New York and she's like oh I want to listen I miss well I wouldn't
3203100	3209500	it's just me being like so what Mary said was well let me let me refine it
3209500	3214620	what I want to hear about your relationship with her faith does that
3214620	3218340	make sense yeah that's always like you're an atheist you're having this
3218340	3222820	specific experience with oblivion but you happen to be life partners at the
3222820	3227700	time with this person who has this other faith which can take all forms and then
3227700	3231700	that that's the thing that I'm interested in when you're like facing
3231700	3236100	this thing and like the other person has a completely different like
3236100	3243140	theoretical opinion about trajectory I used to be the kind of atheist who was
3243140	3248180	angry at cuz I grew up very Christian and then I read the Bible and then I was
3248180	3255700	no longer Christian and origin story of that's the genesis of atheism yeah I so
3255700	3261580	I I my experience like so I know a ton about Christianity and and and
3261580	3266380	specifically I was raised Lutheran and they're very dogmatic and so I knew a
3266380	3273500	lot of like that dogma like the crunch of religion and then I'm so Lutheranism
3273500	3280340	is the Linux of yeah you shouldn't have to touch a mouse Catholics would use a
3280340	3286700	mouse yep this is command line kneelers are good like the kneelers are good but
3286700	3291900	the mouse we don't but so when I first came out of it I was very angry at
3291900	3295980	Christians because I was like how have you not done your homework like just do
3295980	3301180	your fucking homework and you'll see that this is all ridiculous and then I
3301180	3311300	realized this boy saying this is a form of arrogance and narcissism love it but
3311300	3317060	I realized that it was narcissistic and arrogant to tell other people that I
3317060	3322900	knew more about that what they had experienced in life then they had love
3322900	3334020	it and from that elevated position love it decided that if I was to truly be a
3334020	3338300	nihilist if it when it came to the afterlife and our experience of the
3338300	3344140	present then I had there was no difference between being Christian and
3344140	3354300	being an atheist love it yes Queen so so then I was like this is great she's
3354300	3358900	Christian that's great right you know that's Campbell yeah he's just like all
3358900	3364980	right fuck it yeah as well yeah no wrong answers right right because none of it
3364980	3370940	doesn't matter like on a anyway so yeah that was how that's how I felt about it
3370940	3374620	is that you go to church with her I have gone to church with her I went to
3374620	3379980	the church for the first time in more than 20 years how was it I found it
3379980	3387740	really charming yeah I was like oh man I really expected I expected to be deeply
3387740	3391140	uncomfortable and have like a lot of social anxiety in that space and instead
3391140	3395980	I was like this is kind of a great way like a meditation camp like everybody's
3395980	3400260	like standing and sitting at the same time and big church it's we went to the
3400260	3406220	one on um on Highland behind Hollywood mosaic yeah that Hollywood showrunner
3406220	3412220	church I don't know man that's where all that yeah that's yeah it's Hollywood
3412220	3416740	showrunner it's it's where you have a lot of guilt for how how good you've got
3416740	3423260	it Dan the sermons there alone oh yeah me and me and Vince Gilligan like give
3423260	3430380	each other communion other we put our heads up each other's asses and pull it
3430380	3437340	out yeah do an interview with the rap but at the end of it I was like you know
3437340	3442260	if you want to do this I would I would totally do it again because it was she
3442260	3446220	really really really like what denomination was that what is she
3446220	3452980	Methodist yeah she's Methodist yeah so what did you fall I adjusted furniture
3453020	3463260	I thought it was a good time yeah yes Nick sneak it in yeah she her uh
3464580	3469540	everybody everybody she knew was praying for me and they would like text me that
3469540	3473460	they were praying for me and all her friends are very Christian and I have
3473460	3477100	no Christian friends so it's very like they would be like we're praying for you
3477100	3480420	and then I talked to my therapist about it and she was like well that's not good
3480420	3486020	because no because if you think so there's another study where if other
3486020	3491020	people are praying for you you're more likely to die whoa what are these studies
3491020	3497020	whether you know it's backwards math everyone prays for clearly dying people
3497020	3501140	more right right that's a backwards but they know they've done like a like a
3501140	3506660	blind study and like if nobody's paying for you and you and then you're more
3506660	3510500	likely to live and if even if you don't know the person and they don't know
3510500	3515900	you're praying for them you're more likely to die no yes come on it's
3515900	3520300	quantum entanglement it's bullshit like who knows that means that God only cares
3520300	3525380	about you and if other people care about you then you die but if you only care
3525380	3529660	about you then you live I believe in that God there's like a religion yes a
3529660	3537060	jealous guy he's like I don't want Dan Harmon hedging in on my game I feel like
3537060	3541180	you know my heart's stopping while I say that it's not a Lutheran thing like do
3541180	3545820	you feel blasphemous when you do bits about anything that's like in that area
3545820	3550140	no not anymore okay well I mean when I first when I first feel like shortness
3550140	3554860	of breath oh yeah I was like this when I first even in myself in my head
3554860	3558340	secretly quietly was like I don't believe in God I was sure I was gonna die
3558340	3563860	immediately and then nothing happened for years what Lutheranism is the deep
3563860	3568980	fry of Christianity of Protestant Christianity it basically was like you
3568980	3573860	don't even have to go to church your family just has to be fucking repressed
3573860	3579820	like they have to just have infused into them the idea that Jesus Christ is
3579820	3584820	Freddy Krueger and he will get you yeah he's gonna get you yeah like you've done
3584820	3593820	it wrong and it's like it's like fuck Catholics but fuck you that's my that's
3593820	3598380	my personal testimony and according to today's politics I get to say it cuz I'm
3598380	3606740	technically Lutheran it's a bag of shit it started with a good idea hey this
3606740	3615900	Bible should be in German now look at it you know what I rhubarb pie it's true
3615900	3619980	wait what isn't everybody in Lake Wobegon it doesn't matter it doesn't
3619980	3628460	matter it doesn't matter let's move on Nick were you raised religious now we
3628460	3634780	yeah I don't I don't I don't I don't I don't want to hear what Heather has to
3634780	3641740	say no don't I was raised Catholic okay oh Mia boy is de la Sierra de Mexico see
3641740	3649940	yeah I know who said oh that was me yeah that was me you think that this
3649940	3655340	audience is gonna make an audible sound no they haven't yet and did you what do
3655340	3661580	you do when did you stop going to church as soon as I got confirmed I got my
3661580	3666620	grandma's really really like a really Catholic yeah well and so we would go
3666620	3671660	on like major holidays and stuff but I it was just seemed like a big ritual and
3671660	3676860	it just seemed like a big okay wait hey Catholic what are they confirming what
3676860	3682980	is being confirmed can't being confirmed means that Jesus likes you come on I
3682980	3688300	don't know I get it in like a week or do you don't know what was I truly did like
3688300	3692860	a late-comer Catholic course where like it was like I can't get a straight
3692860	3701020	answer about this 46 years old every camp so I go like what was confirmed you
3701020	3704860	have to go through so everybody's got like a total Baptist is here we go
3704860	3709500	Baptist telling everybody what to do this is why the Catholics don't like
3709500	3720580	that everybody's got to write a passage at about 12 13 even even Jews sure so I
3720580	3726100	mean yeah but why is it that's what I'm saying like everyone also has a spring
3726100	3731220	equinox how come it's a reinforcement that you're sort of involved in the
3731220	3734460	church and you're able to do things in the church it's sort of like it's like
3734460	3738300	well you can be an altar boy do things you can be no it's like when
3738300	3743020	evite sent you an email and says are you coming and you have to click the
3743020	3747060	link again because the guests are like freaking out they want to know right I
3747060	3752860	think it's that you're when you're baptized you're too young to to know
3752860	3757820	what you are accepting and confirmation is a confirmation of the things that you
3757820	3767500	accepted in your soul you can sense you can sense it's a little bit of a mix
3767500	3771980	because if you're Baptists you get dumped all this is bullshit but you get
3771980	3775660	dumped all the way down uh-huh and then you well they're Baptists if they don't
3775660	3781980	fucking stuff that shit they're gonna lose to the next firm you're christened
3781980	3786380	just a little just a little different we're confirmed then you're christened
3786380	3792060	first you get christened a little water on you yeah I feel like I remember some
3792060	3796340	water getting dribbled on me yeah but I'm a Lutheran yeah no that would be
3796340	3813380	confirmation you remember getting baptized as a baby and they were something
3813380	3817980	and they were like come up now for the cracker or the wine and then like that
3817980	3824740	you were a baby crawled up something and I went up and did a thing and then like
3824740	3828820	it was a big to-do when I came back to the seat everyone was like I can't
3828820	3832820	believe you did that oh my god I'm like what are you talking about they're like
3832820	3838580	you oh he ate the cracker you drink the wine like the whole family talked about
3838580	3842260	the rest of the day I was like what did I do I did something wrong and now
3842260	3848140	everyone's happy I like went up and I did two things or something well it
3848140	3852100	wasn't a baby no I wasn't a baby this isn't my baptism story this is like me
3852100	3856900	but you remember the baptism as well no I don't remember a baptism I remember
3856900	3864380	having some water trickle in my head sorry I like let's talk about Mario
3864380	3872180	brothers I know I I want to get this straight I I have a memory of some water
3872180	3877460	being trickled on my head okay I don't know what that was probably it could be
3877460	3895820	really anything without telling you I was running through all of my memories
3895820	3900660	of being in a church ever yeah and so then the second one was that I yeah and
3900660	3904660	then I was running into that and you guys were picturing a baby but no the
3904660	3909060	second memory was there was something about communion and like a thing with the
3909060	3914380	wine or something yeah it doesn't matter no it matters a lot to some people
3914380	3922500	yeah well Brandon especially God gonna fuck about them monkey-ass rituals who
3922500	3927940	has the shortest weddings Greek Orthodox is the longest who's the shortest wedding

4218140	4220860	yeah yeah he's going to kill me
4220860	4235140	I that's the full impression there seems to be an inordinate amount of
4235140	4239980	spiders at my house but I don't care about that I mean is that a topic that
4239980	4250660	you have in your transition I have one thing is coiling cable coiling cable
4250660	4254620	that's it like that's the only thing I have anywhere I I well I have one thing
4254620	4258420	about you which is that you were the featured singer in improv everywhere's
4258420	4264420	musical oh boy so I like I want to hear about that I guess cuz I saw that on
4264420	4268700	Wikipedia and I was like oh I remember improv everywhere can we play it fucking
4268700	4277140	no no no there was a pilot for NBC for improv everywhere and oh that's what
4277140	4283940	this is yeah and I was in a bit and for whoever it is that the choice is made on
4283940	4289060	my Wikipedia what's a highlight it baffles me like there's like a web
4289060	4297260	series I did in like 2007 that's got like prime placement but yeah so there
4297260	4304900	we went down to a mall here I don't I don't even know the name of the mall it
4304900	4309700	was not like it was not the Grove or the Americana or it was like and who
4309700	4318180	cares a mall and I had to work as a hot dog on a stick girl for the entirety of
4318180	4322100	the day and the manager came from central management and taught me how to
4322100	4328540	do the job and I had an earwig in and at some point during the day the earwig
4328540	4335860	would go beep beep beep and that was the tone the sound of that was go and the
4335860	4341900	note of the beeping was my key whoa and they're just gonna decide that yeah oh
4341900	4346580	it's D sharp this time so it's just like beep beep beep and then I had to start
4346580	4351540	singing to whoever I was serving and then I would leap over the counter and
4351540	4356100	eventually the entire food court would turn into a full musical for half of the
4356100	4360620	people there you know one of those pranks without any beep nobody was
4360620	4366540	being pranked except the people doing it which I would prefer yeah the actual
4366540	4371180	like move like let's watch what this guy does when he thinks he's not being
4371180	4375620	recorded on camera yeah someone tells him that there's shit on his car yeah
4375620	4381060	or like the people get into the elevator in the elevator floor drops out that's a
4381060	4387140	nightmare I want to go back to Dan's prank yeah so they just go to a guy and
4387140	4394100	say there's shit on your car I don't I don't like prank shows I don't like that
4394100	4397100	they it's like you have a bunch of cameras on a person that doesn't know
4397100	4402820	they're on camera and they're the mark I like the least you could do is elevate
4402820	4406620	that person I don't I don't I want to hear more about this show though I've
4406620	4410020	already talked about my feelings about prank shows that was I mean that was it
4410020	4414940	there was like so I sang a song but how many tanks we did too because you had to
4414940	4421300	wait until the mall cleared because I imagine so everyone shopping in the mall
4421300	4425420	yeah here's this event happening yeah and would come and they'd be like what
4425420	4431140	the fuck is happening and there were people there can't be ropes I saw y'all
4431140	4436180	do that the first time improv everywhere it's a trick she gonna start singing
4436180	4444500	everybody I'll take a giant coke right dude you had to get everybody out it
4444500	4448540	was ours that's why I had to know how to do the job because I did you make the
4448540	4453420	lemonade yeah I'm gonna smash in there yeah I did the whole job for hours I
4453420	4458580	always wanted to work at hot dog on the stick why the hats it's off there's so
4458580	4464860	tall there is something like really Dennis hopper 70s like conceptual movie
4464860	4469060	about that yeah that there were definitely not even arguably but
4469060	4474060	definitely more people on the payroll than there were civilians yes the prank
4474060	4479060	show was allowing them like improv everywhere started with the idea of like
4479060	4483260	like oh well we'll set up on the street corner and there was normal people that
4483260	4488020	yeah yeah and then and then like oh we're doing it for NBC and then they're
4488020	4494820	like okay well everyone involved has to sign an NDA and a waiver and then get a
4494820	4501980	job yeah like you're and you're churning butter and like packing of like you're
4501980	4506740	doing actual work yeah waiting for that's amazing to me it's funny well if
4506740	4509980	you like the improv everywhere stuff started like it was like the Grand
4509980	4513380	Central Station stuff where they would like all freeze at the same time the
4513380	4517120	fucking pressure though what if your what was your song wait was it was the
4517120	4522840	song written yeah the song was written and I it was a cappella for the first
4522840	4528560	like two three measures or something but the important thing of the show the
4528560	4532920	important thing to the show was that the customer was a genuine yeah person yeah
4532920	4537880	and there was we did it so if they started screaming the n-word at you like
4537880	4541320	if they were like I'll take a diet coke and you're like I have a feeling and
4541320	4544920	they're like n-word n-word n-word because they're from 4chan and they're
4544920	4548880	like let's culture jam like and then it was like alright the day is shot well
4548880	4553360	the yeah that yet we would have reset and waited because there was there were
4553360	4559560	three attempts but only two takes and that's one of the attempts the woman was
4559560	4563680	on her cell phone when she ordered and her hand just started shaking and she
4563680	4567540	wouldn't look up from her phone because she knew because she thought she was
4567540	4570920	going I think she thought she was going crazy Jesus Christ you could have
4570920	4577120	driven someone like she just holy shit at her phone oh my god singing right
4577120	4581520	here with a big smile the subtle feeling that everyone is watching you is
4581520	4585920	absolutely symptomatic of like fucking yeah yeah oh my god you could have
4585920	4592640	driven someone to snap so we we didn't use that we failed like I don't use that
4592640	4601180	snuff film yeah but if if shit had gone wrong mm-hmm are you telling me you guys
4601180	4608020	didn't get a safety that was a PA going up and going I have a hot dog oh what's
4608020	4613700	happening no I've been just while you're there I've been on other prank shows
4613700	4619160	where we have or I wrote for a kids show where they they used a couple name it
4619160	4628000	it's cancel culture yeah can't this that's no cancel the show super sloppy
4628000	4633660	double dare you're finished what huh oh no no what's the what's the thing it was
4633660	4641800	called incredible crew and they done it's over it no but redone and there are
4641800	4644240	a couple plants because there were a couple times where they couldn't get a
4644240	4649440	reaction out of a regular person but to what what what kind of reactions were
4649440	4653720	they what was a kid show I mean like so it was like I'm picking your nose while
4653720	4660000	making your smoothie yeah I mean like it was it was a little more elevated than
4660000	4663760	that but yes I'm picking my butt while making your smoothie there was like a
4663760	4668600	bit where like there was a girl with a dog in a cat in a like a carrier a
4668600	4677840	carrier there was a dog in a cat carrier yeah nuts it's not built for
4677840	4682880	them but the carrier was like going crazy and like people didn't care like
4682880	4687920	they were just like yeah that's a like who cares about that person's dog so you
4687920	4691640	had to have somebody go up and be like oh no which would cue other people to be
4691640	4696880	like huh hmm I've talked about this way too much but my favorite prank show the
4696880	4700600	only one that ever made me feel good to watch was the Alan Funt Playboy Channel
4700600	4705560	prank show that he did like I don't know 12 episodes of and it was like I'm Alan
4705560	4710760	Funt and I did I'm famous for candid camera but I'm doing this Playboy show
4710760	4715160	and so like it was like the budget was over $500 so it was basically just like
4715160	4721880	any guy who answered an ad that was like you can work today for this amount of
4721880	4725560	money which is like more money than he was ever gonna get he they tell him
4725560	4731560	your job is to sit at this desk in this identical ridiculous shitty sparse office
4731560	4736920	building room and if anything happens just give me a call and and the guy
4736920	4742400	thinks like they just all they do is just 12 episodes of guys sitting in an
4742400	4747120	office and then naked women would come in or women that would come in fully
4747120	4750320	closed and then when they heard they had to wait they would get naked or like
4750320	4754280	guys that were like magicians they would generate a naked woman it was just like
4754280	4758760	12 variations on a naked lady and the guy reacting but the guy was never the
4758760	4764760	mark the guy would always be like cuz you were the mark in that show I fucking
4764760	4769880	loved it before I realized as an adult I realized oh fuck you know what ruins
4769880	4773240	this show for me is I just realized like it's probably not Alan Funt's voice
4773240	4777960	that's actually talking to them because why wouldn't he if he was available why
4777960	4783320	wouldn't he have been part of the show as a 15 year old who was busy jerking
4783320	4787160	off to all the other playboy channel content I I was like not thinking about
4787160	4791320	it but I was like this is like this is a good prank show because Alan Funt was
4791320	4795960	basically calling these guys on the phone and going hey how's it going over
4795960	4803520	there and then the guy would go I don't know there's a naked lady and what does
4803520	4810360	a naked lady what the fuck are you talking about why is she naked I don't
4810360	4816600	know I don't know I don't know I like that ask her he wants to know why are
4816600	4825240	you naked because I'm the best booby-dooby in the whoopee she she said hey
4825240	4833560	what can I ask you a question yeah yeah what's your name Mario Mario what the
4833560	4840120	fuck is going on over there it was this show is just your
4840120	4846920	refractory period between jerking off he would just be exhausted laying out next
4846920	4851720	time too weak to change the channel what else is up okay this is a good
4851720	4858520	transition they should call that channel the only unscrambled one next step is
4858520	4864760	another girl four years older than you even though you're yeah anyways so what
4864760	4881720	oh gosh what's it like to be a lesbian go in any order everyone you know women
4881720	4889800	are understanding and accepting and and goddamn if I can only be one that was
4889800	4895320	really beautiful thanks yeah I'm sure you have a different opinion oh it's
4895320	4904760	this it's it's great well I'll tell you how it really is I think it's like
4905160	4911480	millennium falcon uh-huh yeah I'm in no I'm in uh go ahead I didn't know you'd have a real answer
4911480	4925000	no what who me uh wait was that another real question no I don't I don't I don't participate
4925000	4931960	in lesbian culture I hate it I hate it so much I don't identify I mean I'm a gay woman who
4931960	4937080	doesn't identify as a gay woman I don't know it's probably impossible to identify as would
4937080	4943320	anything right yeah but but but but I like talk about the relationship with performer status as
4943320	4947880	long as we're there like like because it's like there's a part of you we had this conversation
4948600	4956440	years ago so it's like like you weren't not out but you hadn't come out yeah so uh for a long
4956440	4964200	time I was out to you know anybody who I knew uh but then I was not out like on social media
4964200	4969560	or anything because I didn't want it to be my brand yeah I don't I don't want to be I
4969560	4975480	don't want to be a gay writer I don't want to be a gay comedian or like I'd be a loser
4976200	4983240	comedian that that works for me but like I don't it's I don't think about it at all and I don't
4983240	4989880	have any pride in it at all like I don't feel like I did anything Sarah Silverman said the
4989880	4995080	same thing about like well and this was like a million years ago she's the same about Judaism
4995080	4999480	about being Jewish yeah really and it was like and that's important I I interject that in case
4999480	5004040	anyways for bristles because we're like living in this age of like fucking own it or like whatever
5004040	5009400	you would war with this or at war with that but like Sarah's never she's not hiding from her
5009400	5014680	Judaism but at the same time I remember her saying back then it's like oh I try to like
5014680	5019480	like just trying to like cushion this distance like you don't want to like like am I the Jewish
5019480	5025320	this some of the Jewish that or am I am I just all of this other stuff and on top of that I'm Jewish
5025320	5029240	yeah I think that there's a new you know obviously there's a new school of thought where like
5029240	5036520	identity is like all of the pride that you take in your gender slash sexual identity slash
5037400	5042600	personal identity all those things are like important because then you are also demonstrating
5042600	5048440	a confidence to younger generations and and providing that I don't feel like I owe those
5048440	5055800	people anything so I don't want to do that because you came out yeah a year ago so I came out a year
5055800	5065560	ago uh in large part because I felt like hiding my relationship with my girlfriend was denying
5065560	5070840	that I was in a relationship with my girlfriend uh like I would talk about literally everything
5070840	5077880	else like I talked about like going to the fucking hospital or like you know anything uh but I
5077880	5084840	wouldn't I didn't ever talk about my relationships online uh and it sort of came to a place where I
5084840	5089720	was like this is weird like it's it's actively weird it's weird that you can't do what other
5089720	5096920	comics do which is involve their life and their work yeah yeah so I so I was like well I guess for
5096920	5101080	coming out day I'll come out and that was that and then now I'm out and it's a nightmare because you
5101080	5108360	wanted it's a nightmare because it's a fucking nightmare yeah it's a novel nightmare uh you don't
5108360	5114440	have to answer no I mean no I um no it's fine nothing changed nothing matters is that why it's
5114440	5121880	a nightmare uh no no I don't I don't like this line of questioning yeah man I don't know man
5121880	5127640	like it's all right well I didn't cross it yes I did I asked it but no but no nothing's changed
5127640	5133160	it's the same yeah you expect there to be a transformation at the end of that journey and
5133160	5139480	there isn't one no I mean I don't I think you're using the royal you oh I see all people as a beam
5139480	5144280	of light whoa is that true that's gonna be crazy I don't even know who you are
5145800	5150760	worse have you worked with Jeff have you guys ever been on the same stage at who's line Jeff
5150760	5156440	Davis yeah uh yeah we weren't at who's line but we did a show called Drew Carey's Improvaganza
5156440	5161880	together uh and just keep it seems like you miss each other just coincidentally we on who's line
5162600	5166360	that's because there's only four chairs so the three chairs are permanent and the fourth chair
5166360	5172760	is rotating okay uh so we can't ever be on the same episode excellent um and there could yeah
5172760	5180680	more importantly you were on screen with Jeff Davis when you me and he won an Emmy for Chris
5180680	5185960	Hardwick whoa yes that's true we gave them their Emmy winning episode yeah of course we did all
5185960	5193160	right it was excellent we did it great that's amazing that's fine no I wasn't fishing for it
5193160	5200200	actually the pause you took before you it makes your clap it's fruit of the poison tree I think
5200200	5205000	their pause was like what the fuck are they talking about what's happening what are we
5205000	5209560	supporting with this applause well then don't then don't applaud if you if you if you if you
5209560	5214120	don't applaud spontaneously don't applaud at all whoa don't do I don't want your favorite
5214200	5217400	I don't know if that's true well at the at the yeah
5223960	5231560	goddamn professional y'all the goddamn pro god this is one of those episodes I don't listen back

5308040	5312920	like a big bible well like yeah like a show bible that helps kind of like direct ideas in the show
5313880	5320440	no that's fine no wait I'm hung up on the singer you for real no irony nothing like Jordan Peele

5396440	5405400	I don't know why I'm creating this weird rift I don't know I'm too dry I'm seeing triple of
5405400	5412360	everything whoa well there are three people you you've you've been in comedy writers room
5412360	5418840	sketch writers room so like for real like in a post-black mirror world like this twilight zone
5418840	5423560	thing happens like what is there any insight you can give us to like what the difficulty is when
5423560	5429560	you're in a writer's room working on twilight zone I'm gonna give some insight into writing on
5429560	5434680	Rick and Morty if you needed time to think about it yeah no go ahead go ahead tell it please tell
5434680	5439640	it wouldn't have been funny if I followed your answer I just do it do it say it right now say
5439640	5443080	what you want to say just say it was this what I wanted to say that was it say the thing that you
5443080	5446920	want to say because it's really you want to say something so I want to know what it is because
5446920	5453000	you know me interrupting was a big interruption because there's something there that you want to
5453480	5455640	say I really want to hear what you want to say whatever it is
5461480	5465960	so the the I can't I don't know what I can the NDA for that show is
5465960	5471880	fuck that fucking thick it can't be that what don't talk about anything big deal right that's
5471880	5479880	beatable I can beat that in court I'll take the heat Dan's got lawyers do not do not let him take
5480840	5486440	I said it's okay to talk about everything uh the first season was different than the second
5486440	5493960	season Jordan's there all the time yes and it's it's I mean it's fucking great it's great I
5493960	5500600	yeah look it's all of my sketch and comedy ideas were twilight zone ideas previous to being on the
5500600	5506680	twilight zone they were always nightmares for whoever was in the thing like they're not they're
5506680	5513800	not fun they're not fun the things that I wrote as comedy were horrible nightmares and now I just
5513800	5518040	don't have to put in the laugh bits it's great I know it would have been nice to have you on staff
5518040	5525800	I would I mean I'm hoping something yeah because I would really that was so cool you're hoping
5525800	5529640	but you know like the twilight zone train just keeps chugging and chugging but I'm you know
5529640	5536040	yeah but who conducts the train see that's pretty good for horror stuff right
5536120	5539560	a train that there's no conductor that would work tell Jordan about that
5540120	5545320	tell him that was my idea you can't tell them that was my idea in front of me I thought they're
5545320	5548920	not hiring I thought you so you go there and it's just a conductor hat they pulled up and it's a
5548920	5554840	skeleton that'd be fun right that'd be a fun episode I wish I thought you said who can touch
5554840	5559640	the train but okay now we collaborate on one that's ours that's ours that's the worst
5559720	5562840	that's ours it's a train that can't be touched
5565560	5572680	when Jordan comes into the writer's room is he like he's like he he comes in at like 11 30 right
5573320	5579480	no he's like god damn I finally figured out how to instagram my workout it's crazy that you think
5579480	5585080	11 30 is an early time to come into an office I don't think he thinks it is early I think he
5585080	5591480	thinks it's fine he's he wants to know it's a fine time all right let's move on fine I just I just
5591480	5596680	honestly you know he did it to yourself every day Jordan Peele goes into Twilight you are doing it
5596680	5605320	to yourself get out of that hole I mean you know he wrote key appeal and get out in the same
5605320	5613480	time frame can I can I monster since you have his ear can you can I can I pitch oh that's a good
5613560	5619560	episode oh I've got Jordan here that'd be fun right can you pitch Jordan Peele I gotta get on the ghost
5619560	5626200	train oh it's right here no that's not this is my pitch for a Twilight Zone imagine being a show
5626200	5634600	runner that goes in at 10 a.m every day guys first off he was on your show he's on rig and morning
5634600	5640440	like you can talk to him well yeah but he didn't make the Twilight Zone yet fair he was playing a
5640440	5646520	testicle head but I didn't have a chance to talk to him about I didn't get a chance to say to him
5646520	5652920	like what if you like make if you if you're allowed to not are you gonna show up in the
5652920	5660200	writer's room how to drama yeah yes it's a good can't the logical drama why is this mind blowing to
5660200	5666840	you yeah okay incredible also didn't show up for the record when Jordan Peele stopped by bro
5667480	5668120	whoa that's true
5670760	5673480	god damn what does it take
5679320	5683320	Rutherford where are you going I'm just like look here I want to mic this
5685880	5692840	oh yeah oh that's delicious I see your ghost is pouring themselves a drink whoa that'd be a good
5692840	5699880	episode ghost alcoholic I don't know that was the thing that broke my heart Heather by the way and I
5699880	5708440	know I don't wait we were talking is that you I mean you like me you're like hey let's drink
5708440	5713560	and then like just by virtue of this garbage thing that you would think just shoots through
5713560	5719080	your life and either leaves you living or dead and neither case and then it's like but for the
5719080	5726440	you you're not allowed to really drink yes I was a I was a heavy uh an enthusiastic drinker
5726440	5734200	uh previous uh actually a few years ago I I um I took up boxing and I was boxing so much that it
5734200	5740760	was harder for me to drink so there was a nice um uh gradient between like the years where I was
5740760	5747320	like this is the thing that I love more than anything and then not being able to drink really
5747320	5752440	anymore uh and so it was a bummer that when we finally got to sit down and have a drink I was
5752440	5759080	like I get to have a beer yeah and that's it and then I'm like yeah you complained about it the
5759080	5763800	whole time wait what do you mean what do you mean just give it to me oh no I'm totally kidding
5765560	5770040	I'm like that's that's how I'm going out I'm like wait what did I do no no no no you were you were
5770040	5775320	you you know you were very kind and understanding of the fact that I wanted to drink and couldn't
5775400	5784840	drink um but you know there's a ghost boxer but you know what's funny about our our sitting down
5784840	5790120	was this isn't funny to us but like I I want people listening to hear this because I I kind
5790120	5796600	of it was like I did like in short order you and I were talking about your diagnosis and your
5796600	5801080	experience and stuff and then it's like you're coming from this Han Solo position and you're
5801080	5806600	like you're you're the protagonist in the story about this shit and then there was a there was a
5806600	5811320	precise point when you're like I don't want to be that person and I don't want people to be like
5811320	5815720	contacting me and hanging out with me and treating me different because of this thing and I was like
5815720	5824520	well what I I think I think I'm doing that yeah but at the same time it's like that's not deserved
5824520	5831560	at all like I I don't I don't there's nothing to do with that and it made me want to like run out
5831560	5837880	in the street and stop traffic and go treat every single person you've ever known the way you would
5837880	5843640	treat them if you just found out on instagram that they had breast cancer and like beat it like like
5843640	5851400	it's it's such a corn dog thing no question but take it you know whenever I went through grief
5852120	5855080	yeah you're you're basically breaking down the grief that you went through
5855080	5860520	and it's okay to like be as sad as you were about your friend's diagnosis like that's
5860520	5864680	completely legit thank you Brandon I've been through a lot there's no you know honestly
5864680	5870440	there is this thing and we we uh you know it's almost like you had been through a surgery
5870440	5876040	that we're all here for Dan tonight hey just give it up for Dan for going through that
5877000	5881720	and coming in I knew you were a good audience you just needed to be warmed up over two hours
5881720	5888520	what the fuck did you get here by bus go fuck yourself yeah we made it this far I don't need you
5888520	5893480	you can boo for the rest of the night I'll still finish the show anyways Heather what are your
5893480	5899800	thoughts I was going to say that what was really what was really wild about that feeling and then
5899880	5906920	also the the end of cancer is that like so my first I got to see exactly how long people will
5906920	5915320	mourn me when I die because my first show back sold out people brought signs and they were like
5916520	5923080	like standing ovation and then over the course of the next few months oh my god the audiences
5923080	5930760	went back to just a few people I was like that's exactly the arc of when people find out that I'm
5930760	5939080	dead and then when they won't care anymore it's like exactly five months well that's that's great
5939080	5946040	this is why you chose this show to announce your next cancer tell me where you're gonna be
5947160	5952360	that's a healthy number five months feels right yeah we was it was I mean it but it's funny
5952360	5956680	because like I'm I'm thinking about the friends we've lost we live in a vocation that is yeah
5957880	5964920	yeah like like well they're famous so they they like and it I'm I'm like going oh yeah
5964920	5973160	that's the nightmare yeah it's not the going from this to oblivion it's the actual thought maybe of
5973160	5980120	oh like like oh jesus but why does that matter that doesn't matter does it not I mean well you
5980120	5986440	won't be there for it but I guess it's the yeah well it's it's all there's a I feel like if you
5986440	5990360	if you are an atheist and you feel like nothing happens after you're dead then there's some
5990360	5994840	comfort in knowing that like the memory of you lives on but it really bums you out when you're
5994840	6001960	like even then my best friends I feel that when I think about my death as a visible person this
6001960	6008440	is the one thought I have is I feel advanced um uh animosity towards the public because I know
6009000	6016360	that it doesn't matter how I die I could get hit by a Ferrari I get a safe call on me from uh
6016360	6022600	from a skyscraper I will probably die of prostate cancer a heart attack or a stroke or a god damn
6022600	6029800	it our fucking bodies are designed to fail and mine will fail but because of the life that I've
6029800	6039560	led because of the because I've been visible um my my death will be marked mostly by conversations
6039560	6045240	about addiction like people will say it won't matter if I just like my pancreas just failed
6045240	6050920	people will go you know if you need to talk to somebody about your love of chocolate like like
6050920	6056120	they'll just like talk about addiction they'll talk about alcoholism it won't matter if my lungs
6056120	6060760	failed or yeah and I'm like like come on fuck off you could be an Olympic athlete and you're
6060760	6067800	getting lung cancer yeah fucking dicks but people want like they'll that's what I fear that about
6067800	6074440	my legacy uh I feel I don't want people to like say after I died he should have combed his hair
6074440	6079080	that's because it's like Jesus Christ I thought I beat this you won't be here for it yeah I know
6079080	6083640	but I fucking hate that's the one thing I hate it's that five month I'm like fuck you fucking
6083720	6089720	so you don't you you feel I didn't comb my hair fuck you fuck you like I want I want to be like
6089720	6097640	fuck you so your your biggest feeling about it is that you don't have control over my image
6098600	6103160	yes well wait a minute what are we talking about like what's your biggest fear do you have
6103160	6108040	you're gonna yeah I mean you can high road me you're allowed to my my biggest fear is the is
6108040	6114200	the end it's that it's the is that yeah but the transition moment the one molecule of time
6114200	6117480	where it's like I'm here and I'm not that scares me too however TMZ
6122280	6127320	that molecule was like a little guy oh god little guy named
6127320	6132360	Marky and Marky was like I'm here to help you across the threshold that'd be a good yeah that'd
6132360	6137320	be a good episode why we walk through it where are we going with it uh like break it out for me a
6137480	6142520	little get me in the room with Jordan I swear to god if you get me in the room with big old j
6142520	6148040	I will figure yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't really think do you ever think about your obituary

6734520	6742920	do that I would just be like have a seat because I love it I love fame uh but it felt good to rub
6742920	6747720	it into an ex-girlfriend's face that yeah that's what you want yeah that's what you want but now
6747720	6753320	she knows because she if she listens to this she'll know that that was your she doesn't listen well
