0	21440	This is for you, Tommy Ramone.
21440	22960	We lost our last Ramone, everybody.
30480	31440	One and all.
31440	37400	Welcome back to Meltdown Comics, the Nerd Milk Theater.
37400	39080	Carment Town is now in session.
49080	51680	Let's spend a moment enjoying Tommy Ramone's drumming.
57960	58800	What a good band.
58800	61120	We lost all of the original members,
61120	64240	but they will live forever in our hearts.
64240	66760	On that note, welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman
66760	67960	Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
73640	74600	Thank you.
78200	79000	Goodbye, Ramones.
84000	86040	Yeah, did you ever see a movie called Rock and Roll High
86040	86920	School?
86920	87440	Yeah.
87440	88560	From the 80s?
88640	91280	The Ramones were heavily featured in that.
91280	93800	P.J. Soul's character loves the Ramones,
93800	95800	and she has a dream sequence where
95800	97920	they're in her apartment or something.
97920	99960	It's a cute movie.
99960	103800	Anyways, P.J. Soul's was murdered by Michael Myers
103800	105880	in the first Halloween movie, I believe.
105880	106560	Is that right?
106560	107560	I think so.
107560	108560	That movie's terrifying.
108560	112640	She's one of Jamie Lee Curtis's improper teen friends,
112640	115600	has promiscuous sex, and suffers the fate
115600	121360	that all young ladies do at the hands of a brazen metaphor
121360	122160	for syphilis.
122160	123000	Michael Myers.
125840	128400	It's funny how horror movies, they don't really
128400	132040	change that much in that one regard.
132040	135680	Like the teen culture being put on trial.
135680	141280	You still don't really see that's basically all the horror
141280	144600	movies that just continue to punish teens for the same
144600	145080	crimes.
146040	149840	For experimenting, yeah, for in any regard.
149840	153600	For not doing their homework, for skinny dipping.
153600	155520	Yeah, yeah.
155520	159800	We just keep killing them for being young.
159800	162080	Which was why Kevin and Louise were so awesome,
162080	164800	because it kind of like concretized that mythology.
164800	166520	Wow, I'm boring the fuck out of myself.
170520	175040	I was standing on the front walk outside my house today.
175040	176760	I invited Erin down to do the show,
176760	182320	because I know Kumail couldn't be here, and I had her, hey.
182320	185600	What am I, chopped liver?
185600	190960	The crowd was almost mutin' them.
190960	192400	You actually could do the show.
192400	195040	I told them not to, because I don't like
195040	197440	what's going on around here.
197440	201040	You guys are getting a little too friendly.
201040	204160	It's called Harman Town.
204240	205600	I don't get paid to do this shit.
205600	206960	Not Silicon Valley.
206960	208080	Yeah.
208080	209320	Yeah, you can watch him on HBO.
209320	212520	You love him so much.
212520	214880	I loved the image of him whacking around in his underwear
214880	217200	looking for his Bruce Springsteen shirt.
217200	220120	I've been thinking about that forever.
220120	222640	That's a whole different story.
222640	225080	Maybe I just love the image of him in his underwear.
225080	227760	Maybe it doesn't matter what he's looking for.
227760	231240	Maybe I like to think he's looking for me.
231240	233240	So I was standing on the front walk,
233240	235920	and Erin's coming down.
235920	237720	Uber's in front.
237720	240120	Still haven't gotten over my Uber addiction,
240120	243520	no matter what they do to me.
243520	245200	Erin's coming down.
245200	246240	And I look back.
246240	248440	It's a beautiful summer night in Los Angeles,
248440	251040	and Erin's looking particularly beautiful.
251040	255440	And we've been doing couples therapy,
255440	259800	so I feel like I'm becoming a better lover.
259800	263040	Mentally, not physically.
263040	264080	I look back.
264080	266680	Now, physically, you just picture
266680	269560	Camille in a Bruce Springsteen shirt.
269560	275080	I look back as she comes down the DreamWorks flagstone walkway
275080	276800	that I have outside my house.
276800	279120	I call it DreamWorks flagstone.
279120	282160	It's a certain aesthetic.
282160	287800	And what, you guys don't go to DreamWorks?
287800	289120	That brick they use.
295560	297720	Based on how many people were in that building,
297720	299520	half of you directed Kung Fu Panda.
302960	306480	So she's halfway down, and I'm just taken with her beauty.
306480	309960	She's framed against a beautiful Los Angeles summer night.
309960	312080	A smile creeps across my face as I'm
312080	315920	watching her float down the walkway towards me,
315920	317760	thinking about how in love with her I am
317760	320960	and how lucky I am to be getting to spend the rest of my life
320960	322280	with her.
322280	325200	And she stops, and she looks at me, looking at her that way,
325200	327040	and she goes, are you farting?
331560	335800	I want to know what love is.
335800	339280	Will you show me?
339280	340920	Yeah.
340920	343440	Dan, were you farting?
343440	344080	I was not.
344080	348040	Because those two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.
348040	350720	You could have been watching her float down the DreamWorks
350720	353640	flagstones and be farting at the same time.
353640	357440	We learned in couples therapy that the proper structure
357440	360520	of an apology, Jeff, apologies are not
360520	362960	studied in contemporary society.
362960	366000	There's one man out there in the psychology community
366000	372400	that studies apology, the good ones, bad ones, fake ones,
372400	375960	and this psychological community is always case.
375960	377280	He's a controversial figure.
377280	380880	You might call him the Noam Chomsky of psychology.
380880	382280	He's a lone gunman out there.
382280	383800	Is this your therapist, or are your therapists
383800	384600	quoting this person?
384600	385680	She's quoting this person.
385680	387920	He wrote a book called, I don't know, On Apology.
387920	389280	I think the book is called.
389280	391920	She pulled it off her bookshelf and started reading from it,
391920	394280	at which point I was like, what the fuck?
394280	397040	Is this coming off my time?
397040	400640	You're reading another guy's book out loud.
400640	402160	This is insane.
402240	404600	It's like Netflix therapy.
404600	406440	I don't know what that means.
406440	408760	It's just two buzzwords.
408760	410040	Therapy's a buzzword.
410040	412360	Shut up!
412360	413560	DreamWorks flagstones.
416960	418200	Apologies, Jeff.
418200	419920	They like a good story.
419920	422640	Dan, will you tell me about apology structure?
422640	425160	They have three parts to them.
425160	426800	Apologies have three legs.
426800	428560	It's like a tripod.
428560	432120	A proper apology, one that makes a difference historically,
432160	434840	and a lot of his book is about the history of apologies,
434840	436200	the ones that worked.
436200	438720	What's the most famous apology?
438720	442280	Well, one of the most famous failed ones?
442280	443360	Nixon.
443360	446240	Nixon bothered to say, I'm really sorry if you guys
446240	449160	feel like I'm a crook.
449160	450520	We've all done that apology.
450520	452920	I'm sorry if you feel that way.
452920	453720	It's all on you.
453720	455840	You're a fucking dumbass.
455840	459360	I'm sorry if you have something wrong with you.
459360	461000	I'm sorry I'm so impeachable.
461080	462360	Yeah.
462360	465040	I can't remember a famous one that
465040	466560	really made a huge difference.
466560	469120	But historically, politically, if you examine situations
469120	472800	where a wrong has been done and then someone tries to address
472800	477000	it, there are historically examples of times when it works,
477000	478400	times when it doesn't work.
478400	483480	It's not scientific, but it's anecdotal.
483480	487840	This guy posits that an apology has three parts to it.
487840	491720	Part one, acknowledgment of the offense.
491720	494680	So you say, Jeff, I'm sorry.
494680	497760	I'm sorry I spilled your water.
497760	498760	OK.
498760	501880	You don't have to applaud for each thing.
501880	502800	They didn't.
502800	505720	Step two, well, one guy keeps calling
505720	509440	if there's a mosquito, if he's trying
509440	511440	to start the world's slowest slow clap.
511440	518720	The second leg of the tripod is remorse.
518720	520320	You got to actually feel bad.
520320	522960	You got to actually communicate the shame
522960	524960	that you feel, the remorse you feel about the thing you
524960	525640	did wrong.
525640	527480	And the third thing, a commitment to change.
527480	529200	OK, so all three things.
529200	531960	So Dan, let's say you spilled my water.
531960	535240	And how would you apologize using that tripod?
535240	537880	Jeff, I'm sorry that I spilled your water.
537880	540440	I feel terrible that I spilled your water.
540480	542920	I'm never going to spill your water again.
542920	543840	Perfect apology.
543840	544340	Wow.
548440	551200	Now, what if you're being asked in a relationship
551200	553360	to apologize for something that maybe you
553360	557440	feel it was a two-way street?
557440	559680	Well, that's that you just take turns.
559680	564400	I go, Aaron, I'm sorry that I came drunk into the bedroom
564400	568400	and nothing but my underwear holding my pot box
568400	574200	that you filled with charades paper from your party
574200	578960	and having dumped out all my paraphernalia
578960	585200	and brandished it about like a stone savage going,
585200	588240	you don't respect my property.
588240	591400	I'm sorry I did that.
591400	592880	I'm sorry I shamed you.
592880	595640	I'm sorry I made you feel ashamed.
595640	597720	I feel terrible about it because it
597720	600920	makes me feel like I've become my dad.
600920	602520	And you know what?
602520	607400	I'm going to try to figure out a way to be drunk and accountable.
613160	614600	And if that fails, then we'll have
614600	618480	to start doing the hard stuff.
618480	619240	What is that?
619240	622160	Well, if I can't be a good person when I'm drunk,
622160	627200	then, of course, you've got to become one of those people.
627640	628640	What are you talking about?
628640	634080	The Jason Robards people, the fucking the it's been 30 days
634080	636800	and I'm so proud of myself, people.
636800	638280	Sober.
638280	639320	Quitters, yeah.
644160	646240	I don't want to talk about it.
646240	651120	Let's just hope I get my shit together while drunk.
651120	653600	So yeah, that's it.
654520	657360	That would be the greatest thing in the world
657360	659400	to be the world's best drunk.
659400	661080	It's called a functional alcoholism.
661080	663600	I've got it nailed down in every aspect of my life
663600	666760	except for when Erin and I have a couple to eat.
666760	669320	When Erin loses your weed?
669320	672520	Yeah, whenever.
672520	673320	I mean, I don't know.
673320	676960	It's kind of I'm a bad person when I drink sometimes
676960	679440	with my lovers.
679440	680640	It's not good.
680640	682520	I've got to figure out how to carry it
682520	685120	like a rabbit's foot or something and rub it
685120	686640	and go like knock it off, dad.
691400	693880	Or like a locket with a picture of my dad in it.
693880	699360	Like open it up and go like, I'm not you, man.
699360	701600	And then on the other side is a picture of my mom
701600	703600	and I go like, why did you henpeck him so much?
706600	709120	It wasn't just the booze.
709120	710440	And then I close it.
710480	712400	I'm pretty reacting like that for it.
712400	714480	It doesn't make a lot of sense.
714480	717400	Because they're worried.
717400	718680	About my parents?
718680	720680	No, about you.
720680	721600	I'm 41.
721600	724440	I mean, I'm going to, you know.
724440	725880	What?
725880	727080	Well, exactly, what?
727080	731480	I mean, what?
731480	734760	I'm 41, what?
734760	737160	Are you saying it's too late to adapt?
737160	738680	No, I just finished explaining that I'm
738680	740840	going to try to make some changes.
740840	742040	It's a commitment to change.
742040	743160	It's the third act of a perfect pose.
743160	745400	You said you wished you had a rabbit's foot.
745400	746920	On one side it was your father.
746920	748440	I didn't say it was your mother.
748440	751400	And you've blamed her for your father being like he was.
751400	754080	Well, they can't all be gems.
754080	757400	Also, I've been drinking a little.
757400	760320	I suppose maybe that's why my commitment to change
760320	763400	got a little warbly.
763400	764560	Warbly.
764560	765560	Sports corner.
768680	778000	It's a world of sports, and Dan Harmon is a fan of them all.
778000	780800	Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
780800	787280	Dan, today the World Cup came to its beautiful climax.
787280	789040	The finals happen today.
789040	793560	Obviously, I'd be a fool to not know that.
793560	795640	Top of your head, what's, give me some,
795640	798040	just throw some headlines at me for you.
798040	799120	It's all over.
799120	800800	It's finally over.
800800	803800	The World Cup only happens every once in a while.
808840	810200	It's not annually.
810200	813000	No.
813000	816400	For those of you dumbasses who thought it was,
816400	817640	this is a bigger deal.
817640	819040	It's like the Olympics.
819040	822760	How often would you say, I mean, what year did,
822760	826080	in 2014, where we're living now, what year
826120	829880	do you project the next World Cup with me?
829880	830720	Well, it's that.
830720	832440	I mean, it's like the Olympics.
835960	838320	So four years from now, it's a disaster.
842320	847760	So I've won an ending to won a World Cup.
847760	849320	This is the first time that I've ever
849320	852600	said this about a World Cup.
852600	854520	Anything you say right now will be the first time
854520	856160	you said this about a World Cup.
856160	861280	I'm going to, I would call it a world mug.
861280	863480	Like it was that good.
863480	865560	Bit boomy.
865560	867520	You mean bigger than a cup?
867520	871440	Yeah, like more and more intimate.
871440	875000	Prouder, something that said World's Greatest Grandpa World
875000	876400	Cup on it.
876400	879320	Do you feel the best team won today, Dan, in the finals?
879320	882960	Well, I mean, obviously, Jeff, in the technical sense,
882960	886760	the reason for the sports, various scorekeeping mechanisms
886760	891960	is to determine who won and who is therefore the best team.
891960	894480	Do I feel the best team won?
894480	896520	I mean, sometimes it can come down to penalty kicks
896520	898720	or it can come down to just defense.
898720	900960	And people are like, do you feel like that's
900960	903800	all part of the sport, Jeff, all those things?
903800	907960	I guess my question is, who won today, Dan?
907960	912800	Well, I mean, we all know who won today.
912800	917520	But I will say, I was shocked that they did win.
917520	918600	I was shocked that they won.
918600	919240	Why is that?
919240	927320	Well, because you don't really associate that country
927320	933960	with flat land, which soccer is on a flat field.
933960	937680	And this is a very mountainous country.
937680	938720	What kind of terrain?
938720	939880	Right?
940040	943280	I mean, it's a large country that
943280	945200	includes mountainous terrain.
945200	947720	Exactly.
947720	950040	So you'd expect them to be worse at soccer
950040	950920	than the other team.
950920	954560	Now, Dan, it's the first time that a European team
954560	959840	played and won a World Cup on American soil.
959840	960920	Yeah.
960920	963640	Yeah.
963640	964560	I can't believe it.
964560	966960	I can't believe.
966960	970880	I can't believe Germany won.
970880	971680	Is that a guess?
971680	972160	Yeah.
972160	972640	You're right.
972640	974640	Yeah.
974640	978600	I'm a fucking sport head.
978600	982120	Dan, what do you mean, is that a guess?
982120	985720	Well, I'll follow up that question with, who do they beat?
985720	987520	Well, they were on American soil.
987520	988320	Yes.
988320	991640	And as we all know, in soccer, you
991640	996680	don't just play another team on another country's soil, right?
996720	1000440	It's not like one country hosts for two other countries.
1000440	1002080	Brazil was the host nation, but Brazil
1002080	1003480	got knocked out by Germany.
1003480	1007040	And ignominiously, they got killed 7 to 1.
1007040	1010640	The worst defeats, probably the most terrible feat
1010640	1014280	in Brazil's World Cup history.
1014280	1022680	So another South American team lost today.
1022680	1025080	And tell me why you think they lost.
1025080	1027040	And tell me what color their flag is.
1029840	1032000	Look, I-
1032000	1035640	Just name some primary colors.
1035640	1037600	I think their flag has green in it?
1037600	1039200	Nope.
1039200	1041400	That's not a primary color.
1041400	1046480	Primary, you got a one in three chance just to start off.
1046480	1049200	Chile?
1049200	1051000	Chile is not a primary color either.
1051000	1055880	It's not red or yellow.
1055880	1059560	There you go.
1059560	1060560	Argentina.
1060560	1062280	Yes!
1062280	1064800	Argentina.
1064800	1068320	Lost to Germany on American soil for the first time.
1068320	1071520	That's why it was a world mug.
1071520	1072240	Incredible.
1072240	1074280	I can't wait till 2018.
1074280	1077560	Now, everyone go back to remembering
1077560	1079920	that you're not interested in soccer at all.
1079960	1083440	Dan, what country do you think, in four years time,
1083440	1087600	will be the ascendant team that will shock us?
1087600	1089760	Well, I think based on this year's,
1089760	1097720	this quadra year's performances from all the teams,
1097720	1101520	just observing, I felt like you're
1101520	1104720	seeing a lot of foot action from France.
1104720	1106280	Oh, yeah, times.
1106280	1108280	Like they were, this is a team, this
1108280	1111960	is a country that knows about foot action.
1111960	1118680	So I feel like they just didn't have the continuous,
1118680	1128160	continuous, continuous, continuous, sort of like,
1128160	1129560	sorry, what's that?
1129560	1131000	Contiguousness.
1131000	1132800	Contiguousness.
1132800	1135720	Yeah.
1135720	1138640	But I think that four years, they'll be continuous.
1138640	1140640	When they'll combine that with their foot action,
1140640	1141520	I think France does.
1141520	1143560	They'll be continuous to other countries next to them,
1143560	1145920	like Portugal or Spain?
1145920	1148280	No, their foot action will be continuous with each other.
1148280	1149520	Like when one guy kicks the ball,
1149520	1152760	the other guy will start kicking it again, too.
1152760	1154680	And I don't think any of them will use their hands.
1154680	1156600	I saw what you saw from France this year,
1156600	1157920	is they're very good with their feet,
1157920	1159200	but then sometimes they use their hands,
1159200	1160200	and that's when they get into trouble.
1160200	1162040	You're not supposed to use your hands in soccer.
1162040	1163600	Dan, as you use your feet.
1163600	1166960	Dan, as I'm sure you know, famously,
1166960	1169120	a lot of European clubs went out early.
1169120	1173440	We lost Portugal, England, Spain, France, Italy.
1173440	1175800	They went out quite early.
1175800	1179400	What would you say, if you were going to be the new coach,
1179400	1182280	let's say, of England, what would you
1182280	1187160	say to the youth teams that you're bringing up new talent?
1187160	1188640	What would your advice be?
1188640	1190320	First of all, get out there.
1190320	1192000	Like, use the grass.
1192000	1195280	Don't fight the grass.
1195280	1200000	Never stop running, because the ball doesn't stop rolling.
1200000	1204680	If your teammate is open, then kick the ball to him,
1204680	1206440	and get it.
1206440	1209120	Like, box out the other team.
1209120	1211840	Get in those defense zones, and then
1211840	1214760	make them into offense zones by moving them forward.
1214760	1218640	Encroach on the goalie, and get in the hot boxes,
1218640	1222560	and cross tether.
1222560	1223840	Yeah, exactly.
1223840	1229000	Now, Dan, when Germany ran over Brazil, the home nation,
1229000	1232560	they scored, what, five goals in the first 30 minutes,
1232560	1235480	maybe, or something like that.
1235480	1236480	It's 45 minutes in.
1236480	1238800	It's 5-0.
1238800	1240960	You're Brazil's coach.
1240960	1244560	You're down five goals at halftime.
1244560	1247960	What do you say to your team to rally them for the next 45
1248080	1250000	minutes, to come out and turn it around,
1250000	1253280	or to at least salvage some sort of pride out of it?
1253280	1253920	This is it.
1257080	1261160	There's a bunch of dirt out there, and we're not dirt.
1264440	1266760	God brought us up out of it.
1266760	1267800	Am I the German coach?
1271640	1274120	OK, well, let's do both.
1274120	1276840	No, I mean, this thing got stale after it.
1276840	1278600	Germany's winning by five goals.
1278600	1280160	You want to be German's coach?
1280160	1281680	Yeah, I want to be the German coach.
1281680	1283280	OK.
1283280	1286240	You're up five goals to nil, and you're
1286240	1289040	playing on Brazilian soil, and the crowd
1289040	1292440	that was filled with 100,000 Brazilian zealots
1292440	1295120	has now gone completely silent.
1295120	1297640	You hear that sound?
1297640	1300720	Der Himmels?
1300720	1301560	That means friend.
1301560	1307120	That's the sound of shame.
1307120	1308160	Our Teutonic legacy.
1312120	1314400	We're entitled to this.
1314400	1317040	We're entitled to a lot more than I'm not allowed to mention.
1322920	1328560	But since receiving my new identity as a soccer coach,
1328560	1331320	I have come to accept that we can
1331320	1333760	gain territory on that field.
1333760	1338960	I want you guys to go out there and annex the whole game.
1342440	1344200	Yeah, OK, we're done with sports car now.
1347520	1349840	Sorry, German Harman Town fans.
1355000	1358520	German Harman Town fans, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1359440	1361560	Enough with the German jokes.
1361560	1362080	We get it.
1362080	1365000	We made it an oopsie.
1365000	1367480	It was Germany versus Argentina, and so there's
1367480	1370040	a little complicity going on.
1370040	1372040	You know that that game was determined, yeah,
1372040	1375880	in the back room, like based on extradition.
1375880	1377120	By Dr. Mengele?
1377120	1379560	Yeah, like the whole, yeah, there's like, well,
1379560	1381920	we'll give you three clones of his head.
1381920	1388640	Wait, you think Argentina has Hitler's head cloned?
1388640	1393000	I think a lot of places have Hitler's head cloned, bro.
1393000	1399320	And you need to wake up and check your privilege.
1399320	1402760	Hashtag, what's up?
1402760	1404200	I heard somebody say today, they're
1404200	1406080	talking about Facebook being intrusive,
1406080	1409240	and Facebook, it's hard to delete your Facebook account.
1409240	1412360	Someone said that the CIA might have given lots of money
1412360	1412920	to Facebook.
1412920	1415240	Is there any credence in that, or is that just crazy?
1415240	1417240	Well, the NSA, I mean, you could go online.
1417240	1418200	It's fucking insane.
1418200	1420560	The NSA did everything.
1420560	1421480	No one cares.
1421480	1424120	I don't care.
1424120	1425720	The NSA was all over the fucking place.
1425720	1427840	I'm sure it includes Facebook.
1427840	1429840	They were funded by Facebook?
1429840	1431280	Well, I don't know, funded by it,
1431280	1433840	but they were absolutely complicit.
1433840	1436200	I don't even, I mean, if somebody were to come up, then.
1436200	1437920	Does anybody have any thoughts about that?
1438920	1442120	I mean, we're talking about 25 minutes of somebody.
1442120	1444800	That's how long it would take to finish listing
1444800	1451360	the NSA's transgressions against its domestic citizens
1451360	1454200	in the last 10 years, which have all come to light,
1454200	1458120	thanks to a guy who some people view as a traitor.
1458120	1461680	On Saturday and Sunday on CNN, now they just
1461680	1462560	air forensic files.
1462560	1465360	Now they become like the History Channel.
1465360	1468680	And they just air forensic files where a guy goes,
1468680	1474240	a woman was murdered, and there was only a Q-tip on the ground.
1474240	1476240	Would 10 years from now, would there be science
1476240	1482000	to find out who her murderer was?
1482000	1484560	The answer is yes, otherwise no.
1484560	1487080	There's going to be shows where they're
1487080	1489680	going to find out there's a picture of a guy in the background
1489680	1492720	and facial recognition of a dude in a Facebook site.
1492720	1493840	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
1493840	1495520	Because they've been storing this shit.
1495520	1497000	The weird thing about the whistle blowing
1497000	1500080	is that it's like this big brouhaha, oh, you blew the whistle.
1500080	1502400	You told on us for spying on American citizens,
1502400	1503640	but nothing has changed.
1503640	1505760	And then also, now that the whistle's blown,
1505760	1510520	exactly 10 years from now, that stuff's all admissible.
1510520	1513200	As long as you're kind of sort of connected
1513200	1516640	to the concept of maybe the threat of perhaps
1516640	1518800	being something to do with terrorism
1518800	1522920	by someone's definition 10 years from now,
1522920	1524720	let's not talk about it.
1524720	1527040	There's going to be nine other podcasts all around us
1527040	1528400	that do nothing but talk about it.
1528400	1529240	I hope so.
1533880	1536760	Are you saying our podcast isn't the trenchant political
1536760	1537880	podcast?
1537880	1540920	It's certainly not well researched, I mean, yeah.
1540920	1542560	There's got to be a good podcast out there where
1542560	1545120	somebody that does their homework and will talk about the stuff.
1545120	1546600	And I think it really should be.
1546600	1548960	No, there's not.
1548960	1551360	I certainly, like, my excuse is work.
1551480	1552800	I was writing community.
1552800	1554240	I like to make the nice people laugh.
1554240	1555800	I don't know anything about them looking at us
1555800	1556920	through our laptop cameras.
1556920	1559320	Now you work for Yahoo now.
1559320	1562280	So when does that go into production?
1562280	1563680	I have to check with the CIA.
1563680	1566080	I don't know.
1566080	1568480	Well, there's a different structure over there now.
1568480	1569680	Yeah.
1569680	1571720	I have to go through the industrial complex
1571720	1573800	and then the military complex.
1573800	1575240	And then there's this third thing
1575240	1576480	that's like a combination of both.
1576480	1579560	I can't remember the name.
1579560	1581960	And then the funding comes through.
1581960	1584600	The checks are from Yahoo.
1584600	1586880	But the notes come from the Secretary of Agriculture
1586880	1589480	for some reason.
1589480	1591440	So there's a lot of, like, couldn't there
1591440	1594560	be more wheat in this?
1594560	1598440	Do you know how many episodes you're supposed to deliver?
1598440	1599960	No, no, we're going to make it.
1599960	1600960	Yeah, 13, 13.
1600960	1602440	13.
1602440	1604800	Is it the same time structure, like the same?
1604800	1607160	Yeah, as far as I know, yeah.
1607160	1608920	I don't want too much to change about it.
1608920	1611960	I don't want it to be, like, bloated out or shrunken down.
1611960	1613920	I want it to feel relatively the same.
1613920	1615080	So that's what she said.
1615080	1616880	That's what she said.
1616880	1619960	Thank you, Adam.
1619960	1625600	All right, well, let's, we've got an exciting evening
1625600	1626480	in store for you.
1626480	1627200	That was all the time.
1627200	1630800	Camille Naziani's not here tonight.
1630800	1632160	Yeah, did you hear that, Camille?
1632160	1634000	They plotted when you weren't here.
1634000	1635880	Because he is listening.
1635880	1638160	He's that egotistical.
1638160	1638800	He's busy.
1638920	1639520	He's too busy.
1639520	1643040	He's probably in some movie called, like, You've Got Kumail.
1650480	1651320	He wishes.
1651320	1652160	He wishes.
1652160	1655120	I hope my stutter made it clear I did not approve of that
1655120	1657000	as it came out of my mouth.
1657000	1657800	You've got Kumail.
1657800	1662480	That was my thumbs down on my own dumb pun.
1662480	1667320	Let's bring to the stage the lovely, crimson-haired,
1667320	1668880	phoenix-of-the-deep, I don't know.
1668880	1671280	Kumail Naziani.
1671280	1671880	Erin McGathey.
1687240	1690200	Hello, phoenix-of-the-deep.
1690200	1691040	Yeah, I don't know.
1691040	1692560	I rise, but not that far.
1692560	1693680	She rises.
1693680	1695800	She rises and then drowns.
1695880	1698560	Yeah, I only know that I'm a phoenix.
1698560	1700320	Everyone else is like, she died in that hole.
1704200	1709160	I was trying to think of Pham K. Johnson's X-Men character
1709160	1710760	coming out of the oceans.
1710760	1713360	I whittled together phoenix-of-the-deep.
1713360	1715640	My brain's dying.
1715640	1717960	And I'm going to get a CAT scan of my chest
1717960	1719600	so we can find out if my body's dying.
1719600	1721280	Dan, give me a three-pronged apology
1721280	1723880	about phoenix-of-the-deep.
1723880	1728520	I'm sorry I did bad improv as your introduction.
1728520	1732200	It makes me feel like a hack and like I'm disintegrating
1732200	1735520	in front of your eyes, and you haven't even married me yet.
1735520	1738600	I'm going to try through a combination of.
1738600	1740040	Was that your remorse?
1740040	1742720	That was my remorse, yeah.
1742720	1744320	My commitment to change is that I'm
1744320	1748240	hoping that somehow a combination of Rogaine and a new car
1748240	1753960	will help change me to a younger, smarter man.
1753960	1757640	Possibly a tiny tattoo.
1757640	1760920	Like maybe a yin-yang.
1760920	1763600	Dan, if you were a forest, gun to your head,
1763600	1765760	you had to get a tattoo tonight.
1765760	1771600	I walk you just two blocks down to get a tattoo.
1771600	1772720	You have to shoot from the hip.
1772720	1774120	What tattoo do you get?
1774120	1777040	Where do you put it on your body?
1777040	1783720	I'll limit it to a three-inch by three-inch square, like size.
1783720	1787120	All right, well, that's going to go in my chest.
1787120	1792040	And it'll be Pac-Man from the video game eating dots,
1792040	1795480	and then the dots lead to the word establishment.
1803480	1806960	Which either means the establishment gives you power.
1807760	1809080	Dan, my follow-up question to that
1809080	1811400	is, how much money do you want me to give you
1811400	1813600	to make that happen tonight?
1813600	1815120	I will never get a tattoo.
1815120	1816960	And I'm not joking.
1816960	1819720	What is your outside number for us walking down
1819720	1822480	to the tattoo parlor and you getting that done?
1822480	1825240	Why do you think I said yes to the Yahoo deal?
1825240	1826600	I'm never going to need money again.
1830280	1832200	What would it take to make that happen?
1832200	1833240	I swear, there's no idea.
1833240	1834960	Bad idea that it certainly is.
1835480	1838280	Maybe, but I'm not committing to this.
1838280	1840000	Not money, but possibly, it would
1840000	1843560	have to be something like you getting an even worse tattoo.
1843560	1847640	What would that tattoo be?
1847640	1850600	Adam Goldberg gets to pick what your tattoo is.
1850600	1853200	Adam Goldberg, come to the stage and give me a worse tattoo.
1853200	1854800	But I'm not committing to any of this.
1858080	1860560	Adam Goldberg, if Dan gets the Pac-Man,
1860560	1863840	you're talking about the Pac-Man with the legs and arms?
1863840	1866400	No, no, not the no.
1866400	1870640	Not Pac-Paki, the guy from the TV show.
1870640	1871480	No, no.
1871480	1873280	They call him Pac-Man.
1873280	1876560	You're talking about Pac-Man as the proper circle
1876560	1878120	with the wedge out of it.
1878120	1882000	Yeah, just the eating power of pellets
1882000	1884720	that's an establishment next to it.
1884720	1887200	OK, Adam, pitch me what I would get.
1894840	1898840	Probably just the Community Season 4 logo.
1898840	1901040	Just right on the forehead.
1901040	1903680	And it's in the forehead?
1903680	1905360	And it's Wayne Brady saying, I didn't
1905360	1910000	mind it with the word balloon Community Season 4 logo.
1910000	1911160	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1911160	1911960	Adam Goldberg.
1911960	1912960	Adam Goldberg.
1922960	1924840	I would never get a tattoo.
1924840	1926600	I wouldn't either.
1926600	1929840	I would only get a tattoo of a racial epithet written
1929840	1933160	backwards in blacklight on my head.
1933160	1935040	They invented blacklight tattooing,
1935040	1936640	and it said something terrible.
1936640	1938800	They've done it.
1938800	1940240	Let's go to the tattoo shop.
1942840	1944960	Why do you want it backwards so you can deny,
1944960	1946440	you can plausibly say?
1946440	1948920	So I could see it in the mirror and remind myself.
1948920	1951280	That you're racist.
1951280	1952760	I would never get a tattoo.
1952760	1956240	Although, if I did get a tattoo, I think on my chest
1956240	1961160	I would get the diagram of CPR instructions.
1961160	1964360	Are like two spots where the paddles go.
1964360	1967320	Or down my arms and legs, really good recipes.
1968160	1972880	Like, oh, Jeff, how do you make really good buttermilk biscuits?
1972880	1973680	Well, that's funny.
1973680	1974480	You should ask.
1976480	1978120	But what do you do when someone's like, ah,
1978120	1980280	you should add cinnamon.
1980280	1982920	Like, and you try something one day and you're like,
1982920	1983960	that changes the whole thing.
1983960	1986160	Can I show you my other tattoo, which has cinnamon.
1986160	1986960	Asterix.
1989360	1991840	I'm too OCD to get a tattoo.
1991840	1995360	If I had a tattoo on one arm, I would feel that that arm weighed
1995360	1996920	more than the other arm.
1996920	2002560	I wouldn't mind getting a tattoo of hair on the top of my head.
2002560	2003800	Are you losing your hair?
2003800	2006280	Well, I feel like I've always been a little thin.
2006280	2007640	My hair is very fine.
2007640	2008640	I'm 41.
2008640	2013720	So what did I think I was going to look like Hugh Grant forever?
2015720	2017720	He's losing his hair, too.
2017720	2019160	Well, he's older than me.
2019160	2022720	I mean, Hugh Grant from the movies we've been watching all week.
2022720	2025160	She's had a bit of a grant thumb.
2025160	2026560	A grant thumb?
2026560	2027560	Yeah.
2027560	2032560	I just noticed that if I ever see myself on video or in a picture when my head goes down
2032560	2036800	and there's light coming at it, like, I'd see nothing but scalp.
2036800	2038800	It's of concern to me.
2038800	2042800	Also, where I do see a lot of hair, the old comb.
2044800	2050160	I don't comb my hair a lot, so I don't know if the reason why when I do, like, oh, that's
2050160	2051160	a lot of hair.
2051160	2054600	I don't know if that's just because I don't comb my hair enough or...
2054600	2056600	Maybe it's because you have too much hair.
2056600	2057600	Yeah.
2059600	2064600	Your hair is like, this isn't fair to Phoenix of the Deep.
2064600	2068600	Hey, it looks like it's time for Game Corner.
2075600	2078600	There's a lot of corners to this show.
2078600	2080600	There are a lot of corners.
2081040	2083040	Well, there's two corners to the show.
2083040	2087040	Well, I named both of the corners.
2087040	2089040	That's why I'm not creative, I guess.
2089040	2091040	It's all the same.
2092040	2094040	That's not a fun fact.
2094040	2096040	What?
2096040	2097040	That's not a fun fact.
2097040	2099040	No, it's not.
2099040	2101040	All right.
2101040	2103040	Can I have...
2103040	2106040	I need two volunteers for this game.
2106040	2108040	People that maybe have never been on stage before.
2108040	2110040	You right here and you right here.
2110480	2112480	You've never been on stage?
2112480	2114480	I've never been on stage.
2114480	2116480	You've never been on stage.
2116480	2118480	Okay, come on stage.
2118480	2120480	What is your name?
2120480	2122480	Oren?
2122480	2124480	Oren.
2124480	2126480	And this is Morgan.
2126480	2128480	Morgan and Oren.
2128480	2130480	Hi, welcome.
2130480	2132480	All right.
2132480	2134480	We're going to play...
2134480	2138480	We're going to revisit Harmonized Impressions.
2138920	2140920	Thank you.
2140920	2142920	There we go.
2142920	2144920	That was a mixed reaction.
2144920	2146920	And the crowd goes mild.
2146920	2153920	I think it wasn't good showmanship for me to say it as I'm like doing stuff and it makes me feel a little ashamed.
2153920	2155920	Now do it like an impresario.
2155920	2157920	All right.
2157920	2161920	Tonight, your lives will change.
2161920	2167920	Your children will ask you about the day that you witnessed the second coming of
2168360	2172360	Harmonized Impressions.
2176360	2180360	Tonight, on Harmonized Impressions, we have Oren.
2180360	2185360	Green shirt enthusiasts from Mascarito.
2185360	2191360	And we also have Morgan who probably played the guitar at some point.
2191360	2193360	No, okay.
2193360	2197360	She looks like she plays the guitar.
2197800	2199800	All right.
2199800	2201800	Now the game is very simple.
2201800	2205800	You're like the Silver Lake Don Rickles.
2205800	2209800	Please try my homemade beer in the back of the room.
2209800	2211800	All right.
2211800	2215800	So for this game, Dan is going to perform Impressions.
2215800	2219800	And you guys are going to be guessing what Impressions he's doing.
2219800	2223800	During the game, you both have a Jeff card.
2224240	2231240	So you have one opportunity during the course of the game to flag your Jeff card after Dan performs an impression.
2231240	2234240	If it's maybe an impression that you need a little more help on.
2234240	2236240	All right.
2236240	2238240	And then Jeff will do the same impression.
2238240	2240240	Wait.
2240240	2242240	I have to help do it?
2242240	2244240	If they use their Jeff card.
2244240	2246240	It will make sense when it happens.
2246240	2248240	Yes, one time use.
2248240	2250240	Grab this.
2250240	2252240	Pen.
2252680	2254680	I'm doing this seamlessly.
2256680	2258680	All right.
2258680	2260680	Dan, here are your Impressions.
2260680	2262680	Okay.
2264680	2270680	Now to start the game, you're both going to do a very quick impression.
2270680	2272680	Real quick.
2272680	2274680	Are these Impressions that you've heard Dan do before or not?
2274680	2276680	No.
2276680	2278680	No.
2278680	2280680	Some of them he has, some of them he hasn't.
2281120	2283120	The mixed bag.
2283120	2285120	These are wild cards as far as Dan is concerned.
2285120	2287120	These are wild cards.
2287120	2289120	I can see with a look on Dan's face right now that he's flummoxed.
2289120	2293120	A better word is bummed out.
2293120	2299120	She said in the Uber on the way over, what phrase did you use?
2299120	2301120	I was going to gift you more.
2301120	2303120	You were going to throw me some gifts tonight.
2303120	2305120	All right.
2305120	2307120	How does the game work?
2307120	2309120	All right.
2309560	2313560	We're going to start the game with each of you doing your best Dan impression.
2313560	2315560	I'm going to be the judge.
2315560	2317560	Take that into account.
2317560	2319560	Are we a team?
2319560	2321560	You're not a team.
2321560	2323560	You're going up against each other.
2323560	2325560	Your mortal opponents.
2325560	2327560	Jeff is going to keep score.
2327560	2329560	It will make sense as we go on.
2329560	2331560	Your best Dan impression.
2331560	2333560	Well, the government.
2333560	2335560	What are you going to do?
2335560	2337560	I don't know.
2338000	2340000	All right.
2340000	2342000	Morgan.
2342000	2344000	That was Morgan.
2344000	2346000	That was Oren.
2346000	2348000	I thought that was Morgan.
2348000	2350000	Morgan.
2350000	2352000	Okay.
2352000	2354000	You guys.
2354000	2356000	This duck with AIDS walks into...
2356000	2358000	Oh, fuck.
2358000	2360000	All right.
2360000	2362000	All right.
2362000	2366000	I'm going to go with Morgan because I want her to be my friend a little bit.
2366440	2368440	All right.
2368440	2370440	So Morgan is going to go first.
2370440	2372440	She has one point right now.
2372440	2374440	She has no points.
2374440	2376440	I don't score that.
2376440	2378440	Don't score that.
2378440	2380440	So Morgan is going first.
2380440	2382440	I'm going to give you two categories.
2382440	2384440	You choose the category from which you want the impression to be given.
2384440	2386440	First category is...
2386440	2388440	Ah!
2388440	2390440	I didn't see you there.
2390440	2392440	Second category is these beats are cold.
2392440	2394440	Ah!
2394440	2396440	I didn't see you there.
2396440	2398440	Or these beats are cold.
2398440	2400440	I don't understand either of those.
2400440	2402440	So I'm going to go with these beats are cold.
2402440	2404440	All right. Great.
2404440	2408440	So these are rappers with temperature-related names.
2412440	2417440	And the first time we played this game we had Dan read from Bartlett's book of quotations.
2417440	2422440	But this time I'm just going to give him a topic and he's going to give a fact or riff on that topic.
2422440	2424440	So your topic is...
2424440	2426440	Pickles.
2426440	2428440	For real.
2432440	2436440	As far as I'm concerned, it's two types of pickles in this motherfucker.
2438440	2440440	Jill and whatever the fuck.
2442440	2446440	So all y'all motherfuckers need to get the fuck out of my face.
2448440	2450440	Excellent.
2450440	2452440	So Morgan.
2452440	2454440	I know who it is.
2454440	2456440	Morgan was that A, ice tea.
2456440	2458440	B, ice cube.
2458440	2460440	Or C, vanilla ice.
2460440	2462440	Ice cube.
2462440	2464440	Correct!
2464440	2466440	All right.
2466440	2468440	Flawless.
2468440	2470440	Gold.
2470440	2472440	Gold.
2472440	2474440	All right, Oren.
2474440	2476440	Your categories are...
2476440	2478440	Ah! I didn't see you there.
2478440	2481440	Or falsetto ladies do it best.
2482440	2484440	How can I say no to that one?
2484440	2487440	All right, so this is a member of Monty Python.
2489440	2491440	And Dan, your topic is...
2491440	2493440	The god particle.
2502440	2504440	I already know it.
2505440	2508440	They found this particle they did.
2510440	2512440	I was right.
2512440	2514440	I was right.
2518440	2520440	It's a good particle.
2521440	2523440	Is he from Australia?
2523440	2525440	Yes, he's Australian. No, it's not.
2525440	2527440	It's not supposed to be.
2527440	2538440	I think it's called the Gibson Hughes particle.
2538440	2541440	I can't stop sounding Australian.
2541440	2543440	All right, Oren.
2543440	2545440	What's that?
2545440	2547440	A, Eric Idol.
2547440	2549440	B, John Cleese.
2549440	2551440	C, Graham Chapman.
2551440	2553440	I'm going with B.
2554440	2556440	That is incorrect.
2556440	2558440	It was Eric Idol.
2558440	2560440	All right, clearly.
2563440	2565440	That's not an Eric Idol.
2565440	2567440	This is an Eric Idol.
2567440	2571440	By the way, Jeff, when I hear that sound, what did that sound like?
2571440	2573440	What?
2573440	2575440	A fart horn?
2575440	2577440	Yeah, okay, great.
2577440	2579440	Wow.
2579440	2581440	All right.
2581440	2585440	If someone's incorrect, I'm going to go like this to you, okay?
2585440	2587440	All right, here we go.
2587440	2589440	Talent.
2589440	2591440	That is amazing.
2591440	2593440	By the way, you can offer something.
2593440	2595440	I've been given a gift.
2595440	2599440	You need to use that to help people.
2599440	2602440	Like ship captains.
2605440	2607440	It's better than a real fuck horn.
2607440	2609440	Get something right again.
2609440	2611440	You'll hear it again.
2611440	2613440	All right, here we go.
2613440	2614440	You know what?
2614440	2617440	I'm going to do my next impression really bad on purpose just to hear that sound again.
2617440	2619440	It's one zero, right?
2619440	2620440	It's one zero.
2620440	2621440	One zero.
2621440	2622440	Morgan is in the lead.
2622440	2625440	Morgan has jumped out to a shocking lead.
2625440	2630440	Morgan, your categories to choose from are, ah, I didn't see you there,
2630440	2636440	or the rhythm of spellbound vogue.
2636440	2638440	I better go with the rhythm.
2638440	2639440	Yeah.
2639440	2640440	Okay.
2640440	2645440	So these are female pop stars that were successful in the 80s and beyond,
2645440	2647440	or a female pop star, so that's who this is.
2647440	2649440	Dan's got this nail on right now.

2660440	2661440	Kublakan.
2661440	2662440	What did you say?
2662440	2663440	It's a convention.
2663440	2664440	Convention.
2664440	2665440	That's the poem.
2665440	2666440	I can't.
2666440	2668440	Is that wrong?
2668440	2682440	I worked with Kublakan on my third video, and he was fantastic.
2682440	2684440	And I'm really classy.
2684440	2685440	All right.
2685440	2687440	Okay, Morgan.

2734440	2741440	I am like the Madonna.
2741440	2742440	All right, Morgan.
2742440	2745440	What's that?

2772440	2775440	Jeff, do you know how to make a bicycle bell?
2775440	2776440	Yes.
2776440	2778440	Go ahead.
2778440	2779440	Okay.
2779440	2780440	Okay.
2780440	2784440	When it's correct, then you do the bicycle bell.
2784440	2785440	All right.
2785440	2786440	Boring.
2786440	2787440	2-0.
2787440	2788440	Morgan's in the lead.
2788440	2791440	You still have time to catch up.
2791440	2792440	Your categories are...

2812440	2821440	Is it the Madonna Party?
2821440	2835440	Oh, the pain that was felt by your kind when you were in that cabin.
2835440	2840440	I wish you never to feel it again.
2840440	2843440	Come to me.
2843440	2846440	Don't eat each other.
2846440	2852440	For you are doomed to live but one life.
2852440	2855440	It's polyabdom.
2855440	2858440	All right.

2881440	2882440	All right.
2882440	2883440	It was Liv Tyler.
2883440	2884440	That was a really good Liv Tyler impression.
2884440	2885440	Thank you.
2885440	2892440	Cate Blanchett would have been a lot more strident.
2892440	2897440	Dan, just for fun, can we hear a little Blanchett talking about pickles?
2897440	2898440	Yeah.
2899440	2904440	Listen close and hock into the tale of the Vlasic.
2909440	2910440	All right.

2933440	2939440	And Dan, your subject is traffic.
2939440	2944440	Oh, it was so hard getting down here on the 5 today.
2944440	2952440	I didn't think I'd be able to get off on the 10 because there were spiders and ghosts.
2953440	2956440	But I loved them.
2956440	2960440	I let them merge in front of me.
2960440	2963440	Because I love them.
2963440	2968440	Because I love spiders and ghosts.
2968440	2970440	All right.

2996440	2997440	Nice.
2997440	2998440	It was Vincent Price.
2998440	3000440	It was Vincent...
3000440	3002440	Price.
3002440	3005440	It's a pretty good Vincent Price impression.
3005440	3006440	Yeah, you know.
3006440	3008440	But...
3008440	3009440	Morgan, how old are you?
3009440	3010440	26.
3010440	3013440	Yeah, you don't know Vincent Price.

3040440	3043440	I'll tell you something about good shoes.
3043440	3047440	A good shoe is the most important thing in the world.
3047440	3051440	I got some whip ass Justin Timberlake shoes the other day.
3051440	3052440	I had them laced up.
3052440	3053440	I go outside my house.
3053440	3055440	I'm just gonna go get a coffee.
3055440	3056440	Guy comes up.
3056440	3058440	What are you doing?
3058440	3059440	What are you wearing?

3106440	3108440	I'm not gonna wear some Justin Timberlake shoes.
3108440	3110440	Other than that, how did you feel about that impression?
3110440	3111440	I felt pretty good.
3111440	3113440	Was it like listening in a mirror?
3115440	3116440	Yes.
3116440	3117440	It was like listening in a mirror.
3119440	3120440	I thought it was all right.
3120440	3121440	I almost used my Jeff card.
3121440	3122440	Jeff, what is the score?
3126440	3127440	I almost used his Jeff card.
3128440	3129440	The score is two to one.
3129440	3132440	Morgan is in a shocking two to one lead.
3132440	3133440	All right.
3133440	3134440	Morgan.
3134440	3135440	This is just like soccer.

3155440	3157440	She was born in the 90s.
3158440	3159440	If you're a fan of the show.

3170440	3171440	Let's go to the harp.

3176440	3179440	So we got in the car and we started up that...
3185440	3186440	And we go down the driveway.

3190440	3191440	I am in heaven.
3192440	3193440	All right.
3193440	3194440	We're good.

3230440	3232440	She doesn't know any of those three people.
3233440	3235440	Yes, I did forget all the people.
3235440	3236440	So, person A.
3237440	3238440	That is correct!
3243440	3245440	You get a point, you get a point, you get a...
3246440	3248440	Morgan, you get to go home in your very own car.

3275440	3276440	I don't know.
3277440	3278440	Were you thinking Timberlands?
3278440	3279440	No.

3313440	3318440	Dan, your subject is feminism.
3320440	3323440	There's one thing I don't understand about women.
3324440	3326440	How come they need equal rights?

3335440	3336440	All right, Oren.
3337440	3338440	Was that A?
3338440	3342440	I'm talking about abuse in a prehistoric context.

3446440	3447440	Should have been thinking Patinkin.
3448440	3450440	It was Mandy Patinkin.
3451440	3452440	Mandy Patinkin.
3452440	3454440	That was a good Mandy Patinkin.
3454440	3455440	It was all right.
3455440	3456440	It was.
3456440	3457440	For her first time?
3458440	3459440	All right.
3459440	3460440	Oren.
3460440	3463440	The first time you never forget your first Patinkin.

3475440	3476440	Okay.
3476440	3481440	So, if you get this correct, then you win the game if you get it incorrect.
3481440	3482440	You guys finish it for me.
3482440	3483440	No, no, no.
3484440	3486440	It doesn't score.
3486440	3487440	We're still tied.
3487440	3488440	We key score.
3488440	3489440	Okay.
3489440	3490440	Then we'll go to the tiebreaker.
3490440	3491440	Yeah, penalty case.
3491440	3492440	Okay.
3492440	3493440	All right.
3493440	3494440	We'll go to PKs.
3494440	3495440	We'll go to the tiebreaker.
3495440	3503440	So, your categories to choose from are when a pretty woman loves her diary or abracadabra.
3506440	3507440	I have to go with the pun.
3507440	3508440	Abracadabra.
3508440	3509440	Abracadabra.
3509440	3510440	All right.
3510440	3511440	So, this is a magician.
3512440	3513440	All right.
3513440	3517440	And, Dan, your subject is Australia.
3520440	3523440	It's a whole country down there.
3523440	3526440	The whole country is under the earth.
3526440	3529440	To me, that's real magic.
3531440	3534440	I just want to do things that amaze people.
3534440	3540440	So, I want to go down there and see how they live and show them some things.
3542440	3544440	Look at this.
3544440	3546440	Can I see your boomerang?
3547440	3550440	Can I show you something about it for a second?
3550440	3552440	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3552440	3553440	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3553440	3555440	I just want to show you something.
3556440	3559440	If you shake a boomerang, it's spirits.
3559440	3561440	Do you know there's spirits in it?
3561440	3562440	Okay.
3562440	3564440	And then what happens?
3564440	3565440	Oh, shit.
3565440	3567440	Motherfucker got there.
3568440	3569440	Yeah.
3570440	3571440	Yeah, you like that.
3571440	3572440	You like that.
3574440	3575440	All right, all right.
3575440	3576440	There's palabdul.
3578440	3588440	Was that A, David Copperfield, B, Chris Angel, or C, David Blaine?
3589440	3591440	Yeah, it's a shot in the dark, but I'm going to use the Jeff card.
3591440	3592440	Might as well.
3592440	3593440	All right.
3593440	3594440	All right, Jeff.
3595440	3596440	What happens now?
3596440	3597440	All right, so you're going to do...
3597440	3599440	Just polish the edges of that one, Jeff.
3599440	3601440	An impression of this person.
3601440	3602440	Don't do an overhaul.
3603440	3604440	Don't need to reinvent the wheel.
3605440	3606440	Just round it off.
3608440	3612440	And Jeff, your subject is Bob Sluds.
3613440	3614440	Oh, it's...
3619440	3621440	Seems like a lot of ice and snow out here.
3622440	3626440	All right, I'm going to spend the next 73 million years inside...
3629440	3635440	Inside of an igloo cooler underneath the Bob Sled track at...
3641440	3644440	Rockefeller Plaza's ice rink.
3645440	3649440	And if I come out before 73 years, that means magic isn't real.
3651440	3654440	Also, I have eyebrows.
3657440	3658440	All right.
3658440	3660440	My name is Pala Abdul.
3664440	3665440	Oh, man.
3665440	3667440	I don't really know, so I'm going to kind of guess.
3667440	3669440	I'm going to guess Chris Angel.
3673440	3676440	Dude, we fucking did the best David Blaine impression.
3678440	3680440	So Morgan is our winner!
3680440	3681440	Thank you!
3686440	3691440	Thank you so much for watching Harmonized Impressions.
3692440	3694440	Erin, what does Morgan win?
3694440	3698440	She wins playing Krista Berg during D&D.
3699440	3700440	Morgan, stay on stage.
3700440	3703440	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden and we'll play some D&D with Morgan.
3707440	3708440	Let's go!
3710440	3711440	Let's go!
3713440	3714440	Let's go!
3718440	3719440	Hey, guys.
3720440	3722440	Spencer Crittenden, welcome.
3722440	3723440	Thanks.
3723440	3725440	I feel welcomed by you all.
3727440	3728440	Now I don't.
3731440	3732440	That's applause for you.
3732440	3733440	Yeah.
3733440	3735440	It rises and then it dies.
3736440	3737440	Welcome to hell.
3737440	3738440	It rises.
3739440	3741440	That was a great game.
3741440	3742440	Spencer, how are you feeling, man?
3742440	3745440	I'm feeling a bit tired.
3745440	3746440	You're really high right now.
3746440	3748440	I got a new vaporizer.
3751440	3754440	You're as high as a Georgia pine right now.
3754440	3756440	Those are tall trees.
3756440	3757440	Yeah, my experience.
3758440	3759440	They're not that tall.
3759440	3763440	I can tell by the way that you're gripping the right side of your head.
3763440	3766440	Yeah, my neck's not doing its job so good.
3769440	3772440	My neck could use a little pinch-hitting.
3772440	3773440	Yeah.
3774440	3776440	We're cooperating.
3776440	3781440	Hey, what's with that vapor place over across the street from where we do the show?
3781440	3783440	It's the vapor spot.
3783440	3786440	That's just a place where you go to smoke vapor tobacco.
3786440	3792440	Yeah, they have different colors and flavors and you could talk about your different modifications
3792440	3793440	they made here.
3793440	3794440	Is it open still?
3794440	3795440	Probably.
3795440	3799440	Is that like an uptick off of a hookah place?
3799440	3800440	Yeah, nice.
3800440	3801440	Now you just vape?
3801440	3803440	Yeah, or Woody Harrelson's oxygen bar.
3803440	3806440	Because it says that they have oxygen too.
3806440	3808440	It just doesn't seem like...
3808440	3810440	I mean, I don't know what's successful and what's not.
3810440	3811440	I can't predict success.
3811440	3814440	Spencer, can I hear your Woody Harrelson impression?
3815440	3816440	Hey, man.
3822440	3823440	Yeah.
3824440	3825440	It's not bad, right?
3826440	3828440	He has an oxygen bar?
3828440	3830440	He used to, but it shut down.
3830440	3832440	Man, I saw one of those in Orange County.
3832440	3833440	Fucking...
3834440	3836440	Got a bunch of jars of air.
3837440	3838440	It just doesn't seem like...
3838440	3839440	It's like, Pinkberry?
3839440	3840440	Okay, if you told me...
3840440	3845440	Like, okay, hey, who would have known that just a different kind of frozen yogurt
3845440	3847440	or whatever would take off?
3847440	3849440	I wouldn't be like, who would have thought?
3849440	3856440	But, like, I would definitely not predict vapor or oxygen being like a new thing.
3856440	3859440	Yeah, I mean, I can't imagine that those places are doing that well.
3859440	3864440	I'm gonna say vapor places go the way of the dough dough like oxygen bars did too.
3864440	3865440	Yeah.
3865440	3866440	I really hope so.
3866440	3869440	Yeah, Krispy Kreme, eh, it's a doughnut.
3869440	3870440	It's good.
3870440	3872440	Like, we all could have predicted that success.
3872440	3873440	Make a good doughnut.
3873440	3876440	Yeah, or just, yeah, one that's really bad for you.
3876440	3881440	But, like, every year I do a gig at the MGM Grand Casino in Vegas
3881440	3886440	and there's an oxygen place and people sit down and you strap on up to oxygen to your face
3886440	3888440	and it looks like a bummer.
3889440	3895440	Well, in Vegas that way, I mean, yeah, maybe you might actually need oxygen in Vegas.
3895440	3899440	But they hyper-oxygenate the casinos.
3899440	3901440	It's supposed to be good for hangovers, right?
3901440	3904440	Yeah, don't they also put an IV drip on you when they do that?
3904440	3909440	They have mobile hangover vans where they give you saline.
3909440	3912440	Yeah, they have those in China, but they just kill you.
3914440	3916440	I think you're thinking of Soylent Green.
3916440	3919440	It's still fictional as of yet.
3919440	3922440	As of press time, China hasn't gone Soylent Green yet.
3922440	3924440	Murder vans, though.
3924440	3926440	Just murder vans in China?
3926440	3927440	Oh, yeah.
3927440	3928440	Did you?
3928440	3929440	All right, tell us, come on.
3929440	3934440	There's just like these vans full of Chinese officials that are just waiting to grab people,
3934440	3936440	pull them in and just put them to sleep.
3936440	3937440	For what?
3937440	3939440	For being Chinese, man.
3941440	3943440	How do you know when you're finished?
3944440	3946440	Well, you never are, that's the thing.
3946440	3950440	I mean, they kill you, but two hours after, you want to be killed again.
3951440	3953440	That is such a cool...
3953440	3954440	What?
3954440	3955440	What?
3955440	3956440	What are you talking about?
3957440	3959440	Someone deflated in the audience.
3961440	3963440	Chinese murder vans.
3963440	3966440	Wait, mention, come on, explicate.
3966440	3969440	That's one of those things that I know, but I don't know why I know.
3969440	3971440	That's all the information I have.
3971440	3976440	I want you to just freestyle and tell me what a Chinese murder van is about.
3976440	3979440	I mean, did I not say?
3980440	3984440	You say there are roving vans that will just kill you for being Chinese?
3984440	3985440	Well, yeah.
3985440	3987440	No, not for being Chinese.
3987440	3991440	They're like enemy people, like people the government needs disappeared, you know?
3991440	3995440	So a van pulls up and like, hey, you seem like a cool guy. Come on.
3995440	3997440	No, it's more violent than that.
3998440	3999440	Just grab you.
3999440	4002440	Did they grab you, put you in a van and just fucking...
4002440	4004440	Aceful inject you.
4004440	4006440	And why are you sailing? That seems so...
4006440	4007440	No, they don't.
4007440	4010440	Instead of sailing, it's more like poison juice.
4011440	4013440	Poison juice?
4014440	4015440	What do they call it?
4015440	4017440	MSG Kool-Aid.
4019440	4023440	So if you're an enemy of the Chinese state, a van pulls up and they go,
4023440	4028440	hey, they coerce you or they just strong arm you and pull you out of the van?
4028440	4030440	Yeah, that's what I'm alleging.
4030440	4031440	And then...
4039440	4043440	Did China soften their policy on fire drills?
4045440	4046440	Recently?
4046440	4049440	Like they don't need them to happen at every intersection.
4049440	4052440	Because they did some research and they're totally inefficient.
4052440	4056440	They actually put a tracking device on everybody.
4056440	4060440	For a Chinese fire drill, actually, it's no safer than just having no fire drill at all.
4060440	4063440	It turns out you should just run away from the fire.
4063440	4066440	Somebody's handing you research, I think.
4066440	4068440	That's one of our...
4068440	4070440	Or maybe it's a definition of racism.
4073440	4076440	Amnesty International is handing you an affidavit.
4078440	4079440	I've been handed a phone that says,
4079440	4083440	the execution van, also called a mobile execution unit,
4083440	4086440	was developed by the government of the People's Republic of China
4086440	4088440	and were first used in 1997.
4088440	4092440	There's evidence that mobile execution chambers existed before 1997.
4092440	4095440	The state of Delaware and the United States of America
4095440	4100440	purchased a mobile lethal injection chamber in 1986.
4100440	4105440	The prisoner is strapped into a stretcher and killed inside the van.
4105440	4108440	The van allows death sentences to be carried out
4108440	4110440	without moving the prisoner to an execution ground.
4110440	4112440	Well, that's nice.
4113440	4115440	It's like a dog groomer.
4117440	4120440	The vans also require less manpower per injection.
4120440	4122440	No, I write ahead.
4122440	4127440	Less manpower per execution requiring four persons to assist the injection.
4127440	4133440	The PRCU states that the vans are more humane than previous forms of execution.
4133440	4134440	Yeah, well...
4134440	4137440	Including being bashed in the dead of by a rock.
4137440	4139440	Yeah, yeah.
4139440	4140440	The torture monster.
4140440	4142440	A cigarette with a blindfold on.
4142440	4144440	China...
4144440	4147440	I may be wrong, but didn't China get in trouble
4147440	4153440	for selling their dead prisoners to body worlds a few years ago?
4153440	4155440	Yeah, I hear they didn't really get caught
4155440	4158440	until they were, you know, they were found out,
4158440	4160440	they were selling arms to universities.
4160440	4163440	Yeah, well, everybody was looking at these bodies at body worlds
4163440	4164440	and similar exhibits and being like,
4164440	4167440	where are these old Chinese?
4167440	4169440	All these guys.
4169440	4170440	You hear that, China?
4170440	4172440	We caught you doing something bad.
4172440	4174440	Now it's curtains.
4174440	4176440	Finally.
4176440	4177440	Finally.
4177440	4179440	We finally caught the Chinese.
4179440	4181440	They're up to something.
4181440	4184440	Like, now it's all over for them.
4184440	4186440	They own us!
4186440	4187440	They do.
4187440	4189440	There's nothing we can do.
4189440	4192440	Those vans are coming to Delaware now.
4192440	4195440	Wait, so these vans are just cruising about China?
4195440	4196440	I don't know, ma'am.
4196440	4200440	I just, I'm surprised I was right about that.
4200440	4202440	That's pretty amazing, yeah.
4202440	4203440	I just know stuff.
4203440	4205440	I don't know what the fuck it's all about.
4205440	4208440	Also, like Spencer, if you're just plugging your upcoming band
4208440	4211440	called Chinese Murder Van,
4211440	4214440	just come out with that, because I will go to your show.
4214440	4217440	It's less of a band and more of a live experience.
4217440	4226440	Tomorrow night, Delaware Gas Van.
4226440	4228440	Do they still have bookmobiles?
4228440	4229440	I suppose they don't anymore, right?
4229440	4232440	No, because kids kept being murdered.
4232440	4235440	They kept getting the Chinese bookmobiles.
4235440	4239440	Like, uh-oh.
4239440	4243440	Chinese bookmobiles are a good name for a band.
4243440	4245440	In the 70s, they had bookmobiles.
4245440	4247440	Now, the internet, I'm sure, makes us all obsolete.
4247440	4249440	Did you guys have book fairs?
4249440	4252440	There were book fairs at our school, you mean?
4252440	4253440	Yeah, we had those.
4253440	4255440	But that was fucking bullshit.
4255440	4256440	That's people selling books.
4256440	4259440	The only thing you can buy there is Mad Boots and Nancy Drew.
4259440	4260440	What do you think a bookmobile is?
4260440	4262440	A bookmobile is a library.
4262440	4267440	A public library on wheels, you low-road motherfucker.
4267440	4269440	Dan, Dan, I apologize.
4269440	4271440	Three-pronged.
4272440	4280440	I'm sorry that I high-rode at you on my knowledge of 70s social programs.
4280440	4284440	I am remorseful both because I'm your future husband
4284440	4289440	and because it, again, hangs a lantern on our age difference.
4289440	4292440	Oh, lantern.
4292440	4296440	Update lantern.
4296440	4307440	It hangs a glow stick on the rave that is me being 12 years older than you.
4307440	4313440	Cover me in the foam of, well, cover me in the Rogaine foam.
4313440	4316440	My commitment to change will never happen again
4316440	4322440	because Carter's almost dead.
4322440	4323440	I'm not far behind.
4323440	4327440	What do you know about Carter that I don't know?
4327440	4331440	He has one of these.
4331440	4333440	No, no, no.
4333440	4335440	Nobody has that. That's just you.
4335440	4337440	It's called a Carter.
4337440	4339440	They told me. It's like a Lou Gehrig's thing.
4339440	4343440	It's like I have a Carter flap in my trachea.
4343440	4346440	Morgan, do you ride horses?
4346440	4350440	I do not, no. Okay.
4350440	4352440	Zero for two.
4352440	4356440	You're projecting so much under her.
4356440	4359440	She's just a normal lady.
4359440	4362440	Do you make your own yogurt?
4362440	4364440	Do you make your own yogurt?
4364440	4366440	I make my own cereal.
4366440	4369440	Oh, see, that's like...
4369440	4371440	Have you ever had a wrap?
4371440	4373440	No, don't let the cereal thing go.
4373440	4375440	You make your own cereal?
4375440	4377440	How do you make your own cereal?
4377440	4381440	She puts each marshmallow in the...
4381440	4386440	She hammers each lucky horseshoe on an anvil,
4386440	4390440	catches a star from the sky.
4390440	4396440	The actual base lucky charms you can get from any hobby store.
4396440	4398440	But the good shit you get.
4398440	4399440	Yeah, yeah.
4399440	4400440	Yeah, she toasts oats.
4400440	4402440	Oh, you toast oats?
4402440	4404440	It's much easier.
4404440	4407440	Are you like a muesli person?
4407440	4408440	Yeah, yeah.
4408440	4409440	What is muesli?
4409440	4412440	So I guess I can call it that, but I'll put in dates and raisins,
4412440	4414440	and it has sliced almonds.
4414440	4415440	Yeah, because you get nasty.
4415440	4418440	Does anyone like it?
4418440	4421440	I just came.
4421440	4422440	I just came.
4422440	4424440	Are they sugared dates?
4424440	4425440	Yes.
4425440	4426440	Sugar.
4426440	4428440	Oh, shit.
4428440	4431440	What do you mean, are they sugared dates?
4431440	4433440	Of course they're sugared dates.
4433440	4434440	It's a date.
4434440	4435440	What do you do?
4435440	4436440	You eat them.
4436440	4438440	I'm a graduate student.
4438440	4439440	What are you studying?
4439440	4440440	Nutrition.
4440440	4443440	This is going to get so boring.
4443440	4446440	It's called bioinformatics.
4446440	4447440	Okay.
4447440	4448440	Bio what?
4448440	4449440	Bioinformatics.
4449440	4450440	Bioinformatics?
4450440	4451440	Yeah.
4451440	4452440	Holy shit.
4452440	4453440	Explain that to me, because I have no idea what that means.
4453440	4456440	That's a study of looking like you like horses and play guitar.
4456440	4457440	Yeah.
4457440	4461440	But if a child's trapped under a car, you can flip it.
4461440	4464440	You don't hate horses.
4464440	4467440	Who hates horses?
4467440	4469440	Some people hate horses.
4469440	4471440	If we had more time, you would write that.
4471440	4474440	Morgan, tell me what bioinformatics are.
4474440	4480440	Bioinformatics is where biology and computer science kind of mess together, so it's computer
4480440	4482440	science related to biology and healthcare.
4482440	4485440	So how would you like to implement that?
4485440	4486440	Implement...
4486440	4487440	Bioinformatics.
4487440	4488440	What's a practical...
4488440	4489440	It's the terminator.
4489440	4490440	Sideboards.
4490440	4491440	Sideboards?
4492440	4494440	Sideboards?
4494440	4498440	You're creating a race of super serial horses.
4498440	4500440	We got it.
4500440	4503440	Who can play bridge over troubled waters.
4503440	4506440	Morgan, what would your dream gig be?
4506440	4507440	Jurassic Park.
4507440	4508440	Jurassic Park.
4508440	4510440	I didn't ask you motherfuckers.
4510440	4511440	I was asking Morgan.
4511440	4512440	You guys are too rowdy.
4512440	4517440	I absolutely work with DNA sequencing days.
4517440	4520440	Holy shit.
4520440	4527440	So yeah, if we could do some DNA engineering, that would be ideal.
4527440	4531440	What would be the highest extension of that work?
4531440	4533440	What would you like to create or do?
4533440	4534440	Cloning.
4534440	4535440	Yes, cloning.
4535440	4536440	Cloning what?
4536440	4537440	To what end?
4537440	4538440	Bioengineering to make.
4538440	4539440	Yelling.
4539440	4540440	Yelling things from the crowd.
4540440	4544440	Adam, shut up.
4544440	4545440	What would you create?
4545440	4547440	I mean, that's a pretty fire move from what I'm doing right now.
4547440	4549440	What's the highest extension of that?
4549440	4553440	I would like to create.
4553440	4556440	You mean like some kind of new species?
4556440	4557440	You tell me, I have no idea.
4557440	4560440	Yeah, I would absolutely create some kind of new species.
4560440	4561440	A new species?
4561440	4564440	Yeah, that would be able to survive on Mars instead of Earth.
4564440	4566440	Would it be a mammal?
4566440	4567440	No.
4567440	4568440	Oh.
4568440	4569440	What would it be?
4569440	4570440	Like an insect?
4570440	4572440	Couldn't be cold blooded, not on Mars.
4572440	4575440	Yeah, it would certainly be something basic.
4576440	4580440	A cold blooded species that could survive in the wastes of Mars atmosphere?
4580440	4585440	Couldn't be cold blooded, not on Mars.
4585440	4586440	It's too cold.
4586440	4591440	If we had a Harman Town pinup calendar, you may be on the cover.
4591440	4592440	Do you have a boyfriend?
4592440	4593440	I do, yeah.
4593440	4594440	He's back here.
4594440	4596440	All right, never mind.
4596440	4599440	He's a 14-foot cockroach.
4602440	4604440	A cyber cockroach.
4604440	4606440	His name is Seventeen.
4611440	4613440	So you want to create new species?
4613440	4618440	She had 16 boyfriends that she made in her basement, yeah.
4620440	4623440	Seventeen, I think you might be the one.
4625440	4627440	Until you outuse your youthfulness.
4627440	4632440	So you want to create a new species that might survive in outer space,
4632440	4635440	or like extra terrestrial?
4635440	4636440	Yeah, I think that would be amazing.
4636440	4637440	That's really cool.
4637440	4639440	And so what life form do you think?
4639440	4642440	When I hang out, we could be friends.
4642440	4645440	What form, like Spencer asked, were there to be a mammal?
4645440	4650440	What kind of life do you think we could create first that would live on Mars?
4650440	4651440	First?
4651440	4652440	Yeah.
4652440	4653440	Moss.
4653440	4654440	Moss.
4654440	4655440	Yeah.
4655440	4656440	Are you trying to create moss right now?
4656440	4657440	I'm not, no.
4657440	4659440	But if you could, would you?
4659440	4660440	Oh, yeah.
4660440	4663440	I mean, wouldn't we all work in a...
4663440	4665440	Let's all just make moss.
4665440	4666440	I love that.
4666440	4667440	Everybody knows.
4667440	4669440	That's the first terrestrial life, right?
4669440	4673440	Moss is like plants without capillary action, like there's nothing.
4673440	4678440	Before anything, there's moss as far as open air stuff.
4678440	4680440	How did you and your boyfriend meet?
4682440	4684440	He was in my department recently.
4684440	4685440	At Radio Shack.
4685440	4686440	Oh, that's nice.
4686440	4687440	So you guys have that shirt there.
4687440	4688440	That's cool.
4688440	4690440	What was the shared thing I didn't hear?
4690440	4692440	We were in the same department together.
4692440	4693440	Oh, okay.
4693440	4696440	Did he ride horses, sir?
4696440	4698440	Did he ride horses?
4698440	4700440	No, not yet.
4700440	4702440	Oh, not yet.
4702440	4705440	Morgan, do you think horses could live on Mars?
4705440	4707440	I hope so one day.
4707440	4708440	Yeah.
4708440	4712440	Aren't you worried about the moss becoming sentient and...
4712440	4714440	That would be amazing.
4714440	4718440	I guess by the time whatever we create becomes sentient,
4718440	4720440	we'll be God, right?
4720440	4724440	And we'll be bored and we'll be like, go ahead, kill us.
4724440	4727440	We did it to our God.
4727440	4729440	I saw this coming.
4729440	4731440	I'll put my head on the block.
4731440	4735440	I swear, I've got to stop putting that apple tree in the garden.
4735440	4737440	What was I thinking?
4737440	4738440	What do you think?
4738440	4740440	Do you like Jurassic Park?
4740440	4743440	Yeah, I like Jurassic Park.
4744440	4748440	I think that it could be realistic.
4754440	4757440	I hope that these people can come with Morgan.
4757440	4762440	I was getting upset about the people yelling stuff out.
4762440	4768440	But the thing is, there's some very passionate dinosaur people.
4768440	4770440	And they've committed to their role.
4770440	4773440	They keep defending every subject.
4773440	4774440	Dinosaurs!
4774440	4776440	The Lost Raptor.
4776440	4778440	Look at Jurassic Park.
4778440	4781440	And there's like three of them and they're right over there.
4781440	4783440	Jeff Goldblum's character.
4783440	4785440	They're really into dinosaurs.
4785440	4786440	They really want to...
4786440	4787440	Life finds a way.
4787440	4789440	Yes, yes, yes.
4789440	4791440	Yes.
4791440	4793440	Must go faster.
4793440	4795440	She just made it.
4795440	4798440	It's actually my college roommate who's screaming out,
4798440	4800440	Life finds a way.
4800440	4804440	It's actually an all-female Jurassic Park cover band
4804440	4806440	called Clever Girl.
4806440	4808440	Goddamn it, you cocksucker.
4812440	4813440	What?
4813440	4814440	Clever Girl.
4814440	4815440	What?
4815440	4817440	Clever Girl.
4817440	4818440	Clever Girl.
4818440	4821440	I'm in a band called Cheetah Speed.
4821440	4823440	That guy shouted a Clever Girl.
4823440	4824440	Clever Girl is a great one.
4824440	4828440	I'm in a band called The Mirrored Cabinets Make Me Nervous.
4828440	4832440	Who knows when they're going to attack.
4832440	4835440	Clever Girl.
4835440	4836440	Clever Girl.
4836440	4842440	I love the idea of having that much presence of mind upon your death by murder.
4842440	4845440	Just admiring your murderer.
4845440	4847440	I don't think that's ever happened in the history of...
4847440	4851440	He spent the entire movie explaining to Jeff Goldblum and to everybody else.
4852440	4853440	They hunt.
4853440	4855440	They're not lizards.
4855440	4857440	They hunt like they're people.
4857440	4859440	They have huge brains.
4859440	4862440	And they go over here and he sees...
4862440	4865440	That's all the more reason for him to not be amazed at that moment.
4865440	4868440	He should be like, Fuck! Fuck!
4868440	4871440	What am I, retarded?
4871440	4873440	That's him being amazed.
4873440	4875440	God damn it, I was right.
4875440	4877440	He goes, Clever Girl, you son of a bitch.
4877440	4880440	No, but he went, Clever Girl.
4880440	4882440	Like he was coming as he died.
4882440	4885440	I'm so honored to be eaten this way.
4885440	4888440	He's saying, I slightly underestimated you.
4888440	4890440	He should have said, you know what he should have said, and I would have bought this.
4890440	4891440	Game Recognized Game.
4898440	4900440	Speaking of Game Recognized Game, let's play some D&D.
4906440	4907440	Yes, let's.
4910440	4918440	When we last met, our heroes had burned their way through Bill Martigan's and found themselves in an icy wasteland.
4918440	4921440	Trapped in a net and facing down a terrible Yeti.
4921440	4925440	But before they could escape, they were met with a familiar face.
4925440	4929440	Tylenol with Cody and the unicorn had returned.
4929440	4935440	The unicorn convinced the Yeti to let our friends free and together they adjourned to Tylenol's hideout in the snow.
4935440	4946440	There they sucked on cinnamon toast and Pop-Tarts and cocoa and had a great, if dizzying, discussion which led in a codeine-fueled bender to the purple caverns of Tamarind.
4946440	4955440	In the caverns, Tylenol bid them in onward towards strange and magical gems, and as they did so, the gems transformed into creatures.
4955440	4963440	Squark smashed one of them and Sharpie ensnared the others, and the gang began to wonder about the sanity of their friend Tylenol.
4964440	4967440	But then Sharpie took a shit on the floor.
4968440	4971440	Would our heroes be able to stomach the foul stench?
4971440	4975440	Were the crystalline critters indeed wondrous treasure?
4975440	4979440	Was the unicorn still around or had he disappeared?
4979440	4983440	Find out next time on an exciting new edition of Harmontown.
4983440	4985440	Today, right now.
4987440	4992440	If the unicorn, if Tylenol's still there, we could have Demorj come up and play him.
4992440	4994440	Demorj, are you here?
4994440	4996440	Demorj Brown to the stage, please.
4997440	4999440	Unless you just wanted to have him evaporate.
4999440	5001440	I mean, it's all good.
5001440	5003440	Demorj, you should play mooring.
5004440	5007440	It's Demorj Brown, Harmontown regular.
5008440	5010440	Soccer enthusiasts.
5011440	5013440	That is correct.
5013440	5015440	How was my sports corner?
5015440	5018440	It was informative, in a way.
5019440	5022440	I was impressed that you got the teams right.
5024440	5030440	All right, so right now, there's these creatures that have turned into gems, and we started kicking their butts, right?
5030440	5033440	Well, there's these gems that turned into creatures, really.
5033440	5034440	Oh, that's what it is.
5034440	5038440	So they're all tied up in Sharpie's ropes, or his vines, rather.
5038440	5040440	So they're not moving.
5040440	5041440	They're like tied up.
5041440	5043440	It's as if they're in a net.
5043440	5046440	And Morgan, you're going to play Krista Berg.
5046440	5048440	And Demorj, you're going to play...
5048440	5049440	Tylenol.
5049440	5051440	Tylenol's Cody.
5051440	5052440	Unicorn.
5053440	5055440	And you're real sassy.
5056440	5058440	What do you think...
5058440	5061440	I wonder what Barack Obama would say about Chinese murder vans.
5063440	5064440	Well, look.
5068440	5069440	Theoretically speaking,
5071440	5075440	if there's a van with murderous equipment inside of it,
5076440	5080440	there has to be a driver.
5082440	5088440	And the legal question, just going by my background in civil rights and constitutional law,
5088440	5094440	is just to say, you know, is the driver separate from the one pulling the strings?
5098440	5105440	What I've done is convened a committee to convene a committee, and we're going to reach out across the aisle for some good folks.
5107440	5109440	See if we can't get...
5109440	5111440	Well, get to the bottom of this issue.
5111440	5115440	And when we do, we'll certainly come forward and talk more in depth about that.
5115440	5118440	What I'm not prepared to do at this time
5121440	5125440	is go on the record about whether or not murder vans exist in this country.
5130440	5132440	You have to define murder.
5133440	5135440	You have to define van.
5137440	5143440	Anybody and good citizens with information about this need to hit us up at WhiteHouse.gov.
5146440	5149440	For a limited time, we're giving away White House sugar cookies.
5151440	5155440	What goes on at WhiteHouse.gov? What's the website like? What's the splash page?
5155440	5163440	It's actually, it's really cool. You get to pilot a drone over Kansas, and you can just monitor people.
5163440	5165440	Let me be clear about that. That is a simulator.
5167440	5174440	And, you know, it's not an actual drone.
5175440	5184440	But it is a good way, using URLs to track back and find people, addresses and things who are qualified and are good.
5185440	5190440	And we need good people to pilot drones. So, you know, once again, we've got your information. We'll find you.
5194440	5195440	Thank you, Barack.
5197440	5199440	He's a good guy. He's very folksy.
5200440	5203440	He's kind of fake folksy. He sounds folksy.
5203440	5207440	He's folksy. He's erudite. I'm not sure where he was born.
5210440	5212440	But he feels American to me.
5213440	5217440	Barack, can we just, can we take this moment at Harmontown? No one's listening. No one's recording.
5217440	5219440	Can we learn where exactly...
5219440	5220440	No one's listening. Everybody's listening.
5220440	5222440	What your citizenship actually is?
5223440	5225440	Well, look, I'll do this one last time.
5229440	5231440	I was born in a hospital.
5234440	5235440	All right. Thank you. All right.
5237440	5242440	I mean, you know, it comes up from time to time, and a fellow asked me if I was an eggplant.
5243440	5247440	And, you know, look, man, I mean, you've got to do your own due diligence on this stuff.
5248440	5253440	So, for the last time, I'm born in a hospital, ate grubber food as a child.
5253440	5257440	I don't even think you can get that in Canada, so I think you know where I'm from.
5261440	5266440	You seem more and more evasive. The more questions we ask, the more evasive it becomes.
5266440	5268440	Well, wouldn't you? It's more fun.
5269440	5270440	It's more fun? It's more fun.
5272440	5273440	Yeah, I like that.
5274440	5277440	Jeff, are you leading us towards being a birther podcast?
5278440	5284440	Yes. Oh, dude, I'm a fucking way birther from way back.
5284440	5288440	I'm a diet in the wall. Carry me out in a box birther.
5291440	5294440	Now's where you find out we're a fucking hard line right winger.
5299440	5300440	Yes, I'm a Jeff winger.
5301440	5305440	That's Adam Goldberg being hack in the audience, so I'm repeating him.
5306440	5309440	Jeff, or Adam, is particularly drunk.
5311440	5313440	Adam, are you fucked up right now?
5314440	5315440	Oh, dear God.
5319440	5321440	It doesn't enhance your personality.
5321440	5322440	All right, Spencer.
5325440	5326440	Duly noted.
5327440	5331440	Spencer, okay, so what are we looking at right now? Describe our surroundings again first.
5331440	5335440	You're in the purple caverns. Behind you is the cavern exit.
5335440	5342440	It goes into the purple canyon. Before you is a pile of crushed, let's see, crushed sapphire,
5342440	5349440	and also a ruby red crab and an emerald beetle. They're tied up in vines, as I said earlier.
5349440	5350440	They've been tied up.
5351440	5352440	Because they were...
5352440	5354440	You tied them up last week.
5354440	5355440	Were they animate?
5355440	5358440	They were. They were animating right towards you.
5359440	5361440	Sorry, Dad was a little drunk last week.
5361440	5363440	I mean, no judgments.
5368440	5372440	And I tied these crabs up because they had ill intent.
5372440	5374440	They certainly seemed that way.
5375440	5379440	All right, let's kill the remaining gem beetles.
5380440	5382440	You want to lead the attack, Sharpie?
5383440	5384440	Sure.
5385440	5387440	By the power of...
5387440	5388440	Greyskull.
5389440	5391440	What are you, Adam Goldberg?
5394440	5396440	No, no, I would have said that.
5397440	5400440	Gently. Gently.
5402440	5409440	Boy, I feel like it's been ages since I've recharged my...
5410440	5415440	I think Ray of Frost is like a zero level spell that does like zero to two damage.
5415440	5416440	Sure is.
5416440	5420440	Sharpie, Sharpie, real quick, why are we in this cave right now?
5420440	5422440	Dude, ask them.
5422440	5423440	And what are we doing?
5423440	5427440	Greg Proops played Tylenol McConeen. He whisked us off to this purple cave.
5428440	5435440	Spencer just sat there listening as Proops basically DM'd.
5436440	5439440	I feel like I helped.
5439440	5441440	No, no, no, I wasn't disparaging.
5441440	5444440	Spencer and Greg just invent that cave?
5444440	5446440	You know, it's a cave.
5447440	5448440	I didn't know that.
5448440	5452440	It's a wide world, this Dungeons and Dragons place.
5453440	5458440	Anyway, we were just whisked off to this place and we just kind of like, yeah, we don't know what we're doing here.
5458440	5460440	And there's these crab beetles gem things.
5461440	5465440	I just... God damn it. Do I have Scorching Ray? Is that depleted?
5466440	5468440	Yes, it's not depleted. You have it.
5468440	5472440	You have Scorching Ray on the nearest gem crab beetle.
5473440	5474440	All right.
5475440	5477440	You were in a blackout last time, weren't you?
5478440	5479440	Would seem so.
5480440	5487440	You blast it with a Scorching Ray and it seems to be burned to a kind of rocky crisp.
5487440	5490440	It just is all black and cloudy and doesn't move anymore.
5491440	5492440	Clever girl.
5494440	5496440	Does it count when you're killing something?
5497440	5498440	Maybe.
5499440	5503440	There's one thing left. It's also tied up and not moving.
5504440	5506440	Why don't you guys do the honors?
5506440	5508440	What does it look like?
5508440	5510440	It's a green beetle made of emerald.
5511440	5518440	I take out my mighty great sword and I just do a vertical slice down the middle of it.
5519440	5524440	All right, yeah, it's pretty much immobile. So you do that and slice it right in half.
5525440	5528440	It doesn't move anymore. It's just two hunks of an emerald beetle.
5530440	5531440	It's already dead?
5531440	5532440	It is now.
5533440	5536440	I examine the loot.
5537440	5539440	It's definitely made out of some form of emerald.
5539440	5543440	It might be worth money if you sold it to someone who is into that.
5544440	5548440	All right, everybody scoop all this shit up because we were on a million adventures
5548440	5552440	and then the last time somebody, we tried to buy a hot dog and then we were broke
5553440	5555440	because we never bothered to pick up any of the shit.
5556440	5558440	We spend a turn picking all the shit up.
5559440	5560440	You pick all this shit up.
5560440	5562440	You pick all this shit up.
5563440	5565440	You put it in a bag or whatever.
5565440	5568440	Everything's shiny. It goes in a big bag of holding.
5569440	5570440	That happens.
5571440	5572440	All right.
5572440	5573440	All right, we're rich.
5573440	5574440	Well, are we?
5574440	5578440	Well, you have items that might be worth value if traded.
5579440	5582440	It's like having a lot of sugar or something.
5583440	5588440	I look around the purple cavern for an exit. Not the one we came in.
5589440	5591440	You see, it seems to go deeper in.
5591440	5594440	There's a dark crack that makes it, you know, there's no light in it.
5594440	5596440	And that's why it's dark on a crack.
5597440	5598440	I examine that crack.
5599440	5600440	So dark, you can't see.
5601440	5602440	I sniff the crack.
5602440	5603440	Oh, man.
5604440	5606440	It smells like metal.
5607440	5608440	Like metal.
5609440	5610440	Metal crack.
5611440	5613440	I use my goggles on my nude scene.
5615440	5616440	Yeah.
5617440	5620440	You see the crack up really close, I guess.
5621440	5624440	I turn around and go, waste of time.
5625440	5627440	Mage, mage light.
5628440	5629440	You light it up.
5629440	5633440	You see, it's like maybe within this crack you might be able to squeeze through,
5633440	5637440	but there's like a seven foot space that kind of goes around a bend.
5637440	5640440	It's like a, you know, like a corner or something.
5640440	5641440	Through the crack?
5641440	5645440	Yeah. So it's like there's a little space and then it rounds a bend.
5645440	5647440	Is it big enough for a gnome to fit through?
5647440	5648440	Definitely.
5648440	5649440	I crawl through that crack.
5649440	5655440	You crawl through that crack and you see there's this little bend I talked about earlier.
5655440	5656440	I round that bend.
5656440	5661440	You venture around the bend and what you see astonishes and frightens you.
5661440	5671440	You see sitting upon a raised stone platform, a massive, it must be at least fully grown adult, black dragon.
5672440	5677440	It's laying, must be half asleep, if not more than half asleep.
5677440	5680440	Have you seen these dragons come back?
5682440	5688440	I go back to our campaign and I say, there's a, there's a sleeping black dragon over there.
5689440	5695440	Are they worse than regular dragons or is that just?
5695440	5698440	Can I use my ability to detect evil?
5698440	5702440	You use your ability to detect evil. You detect evil.
5706440	5707440	Racist.
5710440	5714440	All right, guys, we got it. We got an evil black dragon sleeping on a slab over there.
5714440	5718440	I should mention white dragons are evil too. I'll say.
5718440	5721440	Are all dragons, is there a color of dragon that's not evil?
5721440	5722440	Golden dragons.
5722440	5724440	Oh, all right.
5725440	5728440	But don't they have mobile murder vans?
5733440	5736440	Look, I'm just a white dragon. All I know is racism.
5737440	5740440	He's just trying to figure out which race is worst.
5740440	5745440	Can we send Cody with Tylenol in there? Because he's a magic unicorn.
5746440	5749440	Well, can I reduce him with my...
5749440	5750440	The dragon?
5750440	5751440	...shrinky person thing?
5751440	5752440	Who?
5752440	5753440	Won't work on Tylenol?
5753440	5756440	No, he's a magical beast.
5756440	5758440	So are you, by the way.
5758440	5759440	I wish.
5760440	5762440	Can I fit through the crack?
5762440	5766440	Yeah, you can. I don't think Tylenol can fit through.
5766440	5768440	It's not a horse-sized crack.
5768440	5770440	Okay, I'm going to...
5770440	5774440	All right, I'm going to take some pieces of my...
5775440	5778440	I'm going to take some pieces of my rope.
5778440	5781440	And I'm going to take the red paint from my craft supplies
5781440	5784440	and I'm going to splatter it all over me like I've been injured.
5784440	5785440	Okay.
5785440	5787440	Wait, what are you doing with the rope, though?
5787440	5790440	I've been restrained, but I've broken free.
5790440	5793440	So I'm going to take the ropes, I'm going to wrap them around my hands,
5793440	5796440	but I'm going to cut them down the middle so it looks like someone's freed me.
5796440	5797440	Okay.
5797440	5798440	Okay.
5799440	5800440	Scoops.
5800440	5801440	What?
5801440	5808440	If you go in there and try to run some kind of quick-change game on a black dragon...
5809440	5811440	No one else can fit through the crack.
5811440	5813440	I can. I'm going to know if I can fit through it.
5813440	5815440	Well, I can't get through there.
5815440	5817440	Well, I could teleport through there, maybe.
5817440	5819440	But let's talk about this.
5819440	5822440	It's not an episode of the Brady Bunch.
5822440	5824440	We're not gluing a vase back together.
5824440	5826440	What's our endgame?
5826440	5829440	You've got to share with us. What are you doing?
5829440	5835440	Well, I'm going to slip through the crack and then I'm going to...
5835440	5842440	I'm going to pretend that I've just been tortured by people who hate the black dragon.
5844440	5846440	But I love the black dragon.
5846440	5848440	And I come in and I say, like, are you okay?
5848440	5851440	Like, I got free.
5852440	5855440	Where are you vulnerable?
5860440	5863440	Guys, this is crazy enough to work.
5864440	5871440	If only God was six, all of your plans would always work.
5871440	5874440	That'll be the name of my autobiography.
5874440	5877440	Are you there, God? And can't you be six?
5877440	5880440	So some of my hair braid schemes can work.
5880440	5882440	But I'm going to really... I'll slather it on.
5882440	5886440	I'm a charming elf.
5887440	5889440	Half elf.
5889440	5891440	You speak Draconic.
5891440	5892440	What?
5892440	5893440	You speak Draconic.
5893440	5895440	Totes?
5895440	5897440	Do you speak Draconic? Somebody asked.
5897440	5899440	Do you speak dragon?
5899440	5901440	Look on your sheet.
5903440	5905440	There's an answer.
5905440	5908440	Your sheet is the thing with vodka spilled on it.
5908440	5911440	I don't technically speak Draconic.
5911440	5915440	But I think I speak emotions.
5917440	5918440	I don't know.
5918440	5921440	Like evil dragons do.
5922440	5924440	I speak elvish and I speak common.
5924440	5926440	But I think maybe this dragon...
5926440	5928440	Does the dragons speak common?
5928440	5930440	You don't know.
5930440	5934440	Dragons are highly intelligent beings, you know.
5934440	5937440	I feel like a lot of times we feel compelled to do things
5937440	5940440	just because it seems like we could.
5943440	5946440	And we don't stop to think if we should, am I right?
5946440	5948440	Dinosaur people?
5952440	5954440	The great thing about Dungeons and Dragons
5954440	5957440	as opposed to a video game or a pop-up book you read
5957440	5960440	to your kid in bed, like there's no...
5960440	5963440	We could fucking walk away.
5963440	5966440	This dragon is a whole crack away from us.
5966440	5968440	We could actually shout through the crack,
5968440	5972440	fuck you, black dragons suck, and walk away.
5972440	5974440	Is that how you want to live your life, Sharpie?
5974440	5979440	Avoiding every dragon and walking away from every emerald beetle?
5979440	5981440	I killed the emerald beetles.
5981440	5983440	Show me the emerald beetle.
5983440	5987440	I'll fucking slay it like a master born to the task.
5987440	5989440	It's a black dragon.
5989440	5991440	We're constantly getting our asses kicked
5991440	5994440	and doing bad things to good people.
5996440	5999440	Our life has become a waking nightmare.
6000440	6003440	But outside this purple cavern is a wasteland.
6003440	6005440	It's a snowy wasteland.
6005440	6007440	That was weeks away.
6008440	6011440	You're out of the frozen, it's a lot warmer now.
6011440	6018440	I say we walk up the front door like men, cowardly men.
6018440	6020440	We leave sleeping dragons alive.
6020440	6022440	Yeah, he's not going anywhere.
6022440	6026440	He's going to be just as dragony, just as black,
6026440	6028440	just as behind a tiny crack.
6028440	6030440	Where are we going?
6030440	6032440	I'm Maya Angelou.
6033440	6035440	Why?
6037440	6039440	Too soon?
6039440	6041440	I can ride him out of there.
6041440	6046440	I'm just suggesting that we're not ready for this boss level.
6046440	6047440	Alright, fine.
6047440	6050440	I jump on Tylenol with Cody's back.
6050440	6052440	And I say, whip her!
6054440	6056440	You do that.
6056440	6058440	And he gets it.
6060440	6062440	Can the rest of them get on me?
6062440	6064440	Yeah, yeah.
6064440	6066440	I'm a sturdy frame.
6066440	6069440	We all get on Tylenol's back and we just leave.
6069440	6072440	We just see a black dragon and go, nah.
6072440	6074440	Well, Jeff, I mean, what's your name?
6074440	6076440	Well, can we talk about what we want?
6076440	6080440	If she wants to go in there, can I use my amulet of magic?
6080440	6081440	No, not my amulet.
6081440	6084440	My magic circle against evil, offer it to her
6084440	6086440	or protect her in some way with that as she goes in.
6086440	6090440	You can, but it's centered on you.
6090440	6093440	And since you can't fit in that room, it won't help very much.
6093440	6095440	I mean, if you guys want to die...
6095440	6098440	I call a round-up.
6098440	6099440	Alright.
6099440	6101440	A round-up?
6101440	6106440	Adventurer's code dictates no one can refuse a round-up call.
6108440	6111440	Also, there has to be a barbecue at some point.
6111440	6112440	There will be, if we do.
6112440	6116440	I fashioned an old-timey triangle and I ring a dinner bell.
6116440	6119440	I present some beef.
6119440	6121440	Gentlemen...
6121440	6123440	Were there buttermilk biscuits, too?
6123440	6124440	Yeah.
6125440	6129440	Right now, I feel like we're a little aimless.
6129440	6131440	But I know that...
6131440	6133440	There's a dragon in the crack.
6133440	6135440	I know that there's a dragon in the crack.
6135440	6138440	I also know that recently baby plans were presented.
6138440	6140440	What?
6141440	6143440	Remember when we stole baby plans?
6143440	6145440	And a baby robot.
6145440	6147440	Yeah, we have a baby robot.
6147440	6150440	And maybe, maybe this is crazy.
6150440	6152440	Maybe you'll also be on board.
6152440	6156440	But what if we made a town of babies?
6157440	6159440	Because we have nothing else going on.
6159440	6161440	Or what is...
6163440	6164440	I mean, or what's happening.
6164440	6166440	But imagine, like, a town of babies.
6166440	6167440	There's a baker baby.
6167440	6169440	And then there's, like, the taxi driver baby.
6169440	6170440	I like that.
6170440	6171440	I like that.
6171440	6174440	Can I use this amulet of shadow-wirling to see if there is one out there?
6174440	6176440	Is that what that does?
6176440	6181440	It'll take you to the shadow world, but you don't think there's a baby village there.
6182440	6183440	We make our own.
6183440	6189440	I like the idea of settling down and creating for a change instead of destroying.
6190440	6192440	We've been through so much and we've hurt so many.
6192440	6193440	I feel like...
6193440	6194440	Sorry, I witnessed it.
6194440	6195440	There's a sleeping dragon.
6195440	6197440	You know the dragons have all kinds of loot.
6197440	6199440	They're always sitting on some crazy treasure chest.
6199440	6202440	Jeff, there's a dragon in every crack.
6204440	6205440	And there always will be.
6205440	6207440	Krista Berg, what do you think?
6208440	6210440	I say we should get out of here.
6210440	6211440	To make a baby town.
6211440	6212440	Bioinformatics.
6212440	6214440	To make a baby town.
6215440	6217440	Imagine an entire town of babies.
6217440	6219440	That do bioinformatics.
6219440	6220440	And they granola.
6220440	6221440	Oh, yay!
6223440	6224440	Exactly.
6224440	6226440	We could add some dinosaurs.
6226440	6229440	Maybe we make tall babies, but that's terrifying.
6231440	6232440	Never mind.
6232440	6233440	Nah, that's the worst.
6233440	6235440	That's the worst idea I've ever had.
6235440	6237440	That's an awful idea.
6237440	6240440	Giant, like the little bodies, but with long legs.
6240440	6242440	And they're sophisticated.
6242440	6243440	Close encounters.
6243440	6247440	All right, Cork, what if we tied a rope around you?
6247440	6248440	Yeah.
6248440	6249440	And let you go in the crack.
6249440	6251440	You go talk to the dragon.
6252440	6253440	I'll yank you back.
6253440	6255440	The dragon in the crack.
6256440	6257440	What?
6257440	6258440	Dragon in the crack.
6258440	6259440	The black dragon.
6259440	6260440	Yeah.
6260440	6262440	I mean, because I don't want you to be unhappy.
6262440	6265440	Did you already know that he was evil?
6265440	6266440	We detected evil.
6266440	6267440	I feel like if I'm going to go in there.
6267440	6268440	Yeah, he's evil.
6268440	6270440	I want Christopher to come with me because he's the thief.
6270440	6273440	He's the most stealthy among us.
6273440	6274440	Can I fit?
6274440	6275440	Yeah.
6276440	6278440	Well, let me tie a rope.
6278440	6279440	Okay.
6280440	6282440	I crawl back to the crack.
6282440	6285440	I just poke my head around and see what else I see beside a sleeping dragon.
6285440	6287440	You'd see pretty much nothing else.
6287440	6291440	It's otherwise a barren cavern that has no other exits or entrances.
6291440	6294440	And there's nothing that looks like a treasure chest or anything sexy?
6294440	6295440	Not even little.
6295440	6298440	You guys see a treasure chest or anything?
6298440	6299440	I crawl back to the...
6299440	6300440	I'm kidding.
6300440	6301440	I don't really do that.
6301440	6303440	I crawl back to the crack and go, Jesus Christ, keep it down.
6303440	6304440	All right.
6304440	6305440	Okay.
6305440	6306440	I say, all right.
6306440	6307440	Look, you're right.
6307440	6308440	There's only a diamond in the crack.
6308440	6310440	Sun roof top.
6310440	6311440	Dig in the scene.
6311440	6313440	With a gangster link.
6316440	6317440	I didn't understand that reference.
6317440	6319440	The village.
6319440	6320440	Dragon in the crack.
6320440	6321440	Sun roof top.
6321440	6329440	I mean, I'll bet you 10,000 Flurbos, whatever the fucking currency is.
6329440	6331440	You don't have 10,000 Flurbos.
6334440	6336440	That we go out of this purple cave.
6336440	6337440	Yeah.
6337440	6340440	We're going to find some settlement or township.
6340440	6341440	Okay.
6341440	6347440	And they're going to go, I'll give you a million Flurbos if you kill that black dragon.
6347440	6350440	And we're going to get to sleep, recharge our spells.
6350440	6352440	And that sounds like so much fun.
6355440	6357440	Wait, but you wanted to make a baby village.
6357440	6358440	I'm trying to help you.
6358440	6360440	You also wanted to walk into the crack.
6360440	6362440	Walk into the crack, motherfucker.
6362440	6364440	Walk in.
6364440	6365440	Dragon in the crack.
6365440	6366440	Sun roof top.
6366440	6367440	Walk in the crack.
6367440	6368440	Everyone go in the crack.
6368440	6369440	Everyone go in the crack.
6369440	6371440	I walk in the crack, but I have the ropes.
6371440	6372440	I do make a plan.
6372440	6373440	Yes, do the thing.
6373440	6374440	Okay.
6374440	6375440	I walk in the crack.
6375440	6376440	I'm not going to fucking...
6376440	6377440	Hold onto your butt.
6377440	6378440	As a barbarian.
6378440	6379440	As a barbarian.
6379440	6385440	I don't like that there's just dragons laying a fucking round, fucking doing nothing.
6385440	6388440	I'm going to kill a dragon for no reason.
6388440	6390440	Because you know what?
6390440	6393440	We have become chaotic neutral, right?
6393440	6394440	At least.
6394440	6396440	At least.
6396440	6398440	At the very least, we're chaotic.
6398440	6399440	All right.
6399440	6402440	Aaron, Mulrain, go talk to the dragon.
6402440	6408440	Do this Sesame Street level con game on him.
6408440	6409440	All right.
6409440	6410440	Where you literally said...
6410440	6413440	No, I don't care about Sesame Street because at least it's something.
6413440	6414440	Okay.
6414440	6415440	I do it.
6415440	6420440	I go in there with Christopher Berg as a gnome where I can kind of fit through the crack.
6420440	6422440	And he's small enough to fit through, right Spencer?
6422440	6425440	Yeah, but I thought he wanted to get out of here.
6425440	6431440	I say Christopher Berg, we go in there because I've never met a dragon that didn't sit on
6431440	6433440	some sort of fucking crazy treasure.
6433440	6435440	And I'm easily swayed.
6435440	6436440	What?
6436440	6437440	Let's go.
6437440	6438440	All right.
6438440	6439440	She's in.
6439440	6440440	Yeah.
6440440	6443440	Part of bioinformatics is adaptation.
6443440	6444440	Wait.
6444440	6445440	You're Christopher Berg?
6445440	6446440	Yeah.
6446440	6447440	And you're Tylenol?
6447440	6448440	I'm Tylenol.
6448440	6449440	Okay.
6449440	6450440	Yeah.
6450440	6451440	So Christopher Berg, let's go.
6451440	6452440	And I'm too big to fit through the crack.
6452440	6453440	You can fit through the crack.
6453440	6454440	I don't know where you got this.
6454440	6455440	Fuck.
6455440	6456440	Fuck.
6456440	6457440	Fuck.
6457440	6458440	Hey, Sharpie.
6458440	6461440	Hey, you can fit through the crack.
6461440	6462440	I'm coming.
6462440	6464440	I'm going to make a prediction.
6464440	6465440	Metagaming?
6465440	6469440	Spencer's wanted to kill us for three months.
6469440	6479440	And we are walking into a six foot hole and handing him a shovel because he is ready to
6479440	6480440	move on.
6480440	6482520	You've missed all the cracks before.
6482520	6485560	You just don't look at them.
6485560	6486560	I run inside.
6486560	6491640	Are you saying that all the fucking things that we've destroyed, all the travails that
6492640	6499640	we've traversed, that we can't kill one sleeping dragon?
6499640	6501640	Half asleep.
6501640	6502640	I'm scared of the black ones.
6502640	6505640	Some mole rain runs in, right?
6505640	6506640	I run in.
6506640	6509640	I have fake bloods better on me and the ropes and everything.
6509640	6510640	Uh-huh.
6510640	6516640	But we're all just hanging back.
6516640	6519640	Describe the chamber, Spencer, that the dragon lives in.
6519640	6524640	It looks like a cave, roughly a kidney bean shaped and floor plan.
6524640	6525640	Kidney bean shaped!
6525640	6531640	Of course, the geography of a cave makes its ceiling and walls be all weird shaped.
6531640	6533640	Where is the dragon in the bean?
6533640	6538640	It's sitting right in the bean's middle section.
6538640	6539640	Ha!
6539640	6540640	Ha!
6540640	6541640	Ha!
6541640	6542640	Ha!
6542640	6543640	That's not the best.
6543640	6546640	This is my favorite part of every...
6546640	6553640	All right, let's all agree that while mole rain does this, we all are very near the exit.
6553640	6555640	Or very near the popcorn machine.
6555640	6557640	I'm just eating popcorn and watching.
6557640	6559640	I'll show you.
6559640	6561640	So, yeah, you make those noises.
6561640	6563640	It's still seemingly asleep.
6563640	6565640	It's not really registering you right now.
6565640	6566640	Ha!
6566640	6567640	I lock up and I...
6567640	6571640	I get closer to the exit.
6571640	6575640	He's asleep, so I poke around the room.
6575640	6576640	All right.
6576640	6577640	Yeah.
6577640	6579640	Should we find anything?
6579640	6583640	There's really nothing else other than this dragon sitting on this stone platform.
6583640	6586640	Is poking around a full move action?
6586640	6587640	Sure.
6587640	6589640	I make a...
6589640	6591640	I make a gasp.
6591640	6592640	You gasp?
6592640	6595640	And I flop myself down in front of the black dragon.
6595640	6597640	She's trying to wake up this dragon.
6597640	6604640	The dragon stirs and slowly its long serpentine head lifts up off of its place on its...
6604640	6606640	front paws.
6606640	6607640	I get...
6607640	6611640	I get all the way into the exit.
6611640	6615640	I'm basically leaving.
6615640	6617640	Hey.
6617640	6618640	So glad you're awake.
6618640	6622640	Jesus Christ.
6622640	6627640	It continues to stir and it starts to look at you like half waking up, you know?
6627640	6628640	Okay.
6628640	6630640	Hello.
6631640	6632640	Wow.
6632640	6634640	Glad you're awake.
6634640	6639640	This has been a long journey for me.
6639640	6641640	From point A to point B.
6641640	6645640	Point A being that I learned that you are the dragon that's the best dragon.
6645640	6647640	Who has the best ideas about everything.
6647640	6650640	And point B being finally meeting you because there's a...
6650640	6656640	There is a town that is coming for you and I am here to protect you.
6656640	6657640	They tied me up.
6657640	6663640	They cut me and don't look for the cuts but they...
6663640	6665640	There is blood.
6665640	6669640	I mean, I threw up a lot of blood and they took that blood on my spatter.
6669640	6670640	I mean, this is gross.
6670640	6677640	You don't want to hear this but what is happening?
6677640	6682640	It opens and closes its mouth a couple times revealing its razor sharp jaws.
6682640	6687640	And you can see acid starting to bubble up in its mouth hole.
6687640	6689640	Well, no, wait.
6689640	6691640	That happens to me when I sleep too.
6691640	6693640	I actually...
6693640	6695640	It could be nothing.
6695640	6696640	Exactly.
6696640	6700640	I would get mad too hearing about this town.
6700640	6703640	I mean, my mouth is foaming.
6703640	6704640	Thinking about this.
6704640	6708640	But I mean, I guess I'll get on your back and I'll ride you to victory.
6708640	6711640	Like, how do we make this work?
6711640	6712640	Or like, where are your diamonds?
6712640	6716640	Or like, what's your story?
6716640	6719640	I'm all the way outside the fucking cave.
6719640	6730640	The dragon roars ferociously so loud that your ears are ringing and hurt and you feel bad about hearing that noise.
6730640	6731640	So loud is it.
6731640	6735640	So let's just talk differently.
6735640	6742640	If we can communicate differently, are we cool?
6742640	6745640	It just continues to look at you after...
6745640	6746640	What was it?
6746640	6747640	Roaring?
6747640	6748640	It did, right?
6748640	6754640	After roaring and you see maybe where the tonsils would be on its throat.
6754640	6759640	They start to bulge up like maybe like a toad's sack.
6759640	6761640	What a toad's close.
6761640	6763640	Okay, so I run out through the crack.
6763640	6764640	What the fuck?
6764640	6765640	What the fuck?
6765640	6767640	Let's get out of here.
6767640	6768640	Me first.
6768640	6769640	Get out of here.
6769640	6770640	Everybody on my back.
6770640	6771640	Come on.
6771640	6773640	Everybody on my back.
6773640	6774640	Miss Steph?
6774640	6778640	You fucking asshole.
6778640	6782640	I'm riding everybody out of there while this argument's going on.
6782640	6783640	Sorry, guys.
6783640	6787640	You know, we all miss Steph sometimes.
6787640	6792640	Yeah, but sometimes everyone's telling you, don't miss Steph.
6792640	6794640	And then you're like, no, for real.
6794640	6795640	Miss Steph.
6795640	6798640	Although everybody wanted to go in that fucking crack.
6798640	6800640	I wanted to sneak in there.
6800640	6802640	I didn't want to go wake him up.
6802640	6804640	I didn't want to go...
6804640	6805640	Nah, come on.
6805640	6808640	You all wanted your crack and you all got it.
6808640	6811640	I alone wanted to run first.
6811640	6813640	It would have saved us 20 minutes of game time.
6813640	6815640	No, I would have gotten in there with Christoper.
6815640	6817640	We would have gotten in there and Wally was asleep.
6817640	6820640	We would have sneaked in there and tried to rob him.
6820640	6822640	Like burglars.
6822640	6826640	To the baby village!
6826640	6831640	So you ride out of these purple caverns and you can't really see for a moment the light.
6831640	6832640	It's blinding you.
6832640	6836640	But the first thing you see in the sky is a large black shape.
6836640	6837640	It's floating.
6837640	6838640	Fuck.
6838640	6839640	God damn it.
6839640	6840640	Towards you.
6840640	6841640	He's pulling us over.
6841640	6842640	It's...
6842640	6843640	Oh, no.
6843640	6844640	Yeah, sure.
6844640	6845640	No, no.
6845640	6846640	No, no.
6846640	6848640	What is the shape that I mentioned?
6848640	6849640	I'm not sure.
6849640	6850640	Large and black.
6850640	6852640	Oh, it's black and silver.
6852640	6853640	It looks like a...
6853640	6855640	It's a zeppelin.
6855640	6858640	You see the markings on the zeppelin.
6858640	6861640	It seems to be the markings of Admiral Darkstar.
6861640	6865640	The zeppelin is heading directly towards you incredibly quickly.
6865640	6869640	It appears to be on a crash course with your direct location.
6869640	6871640	Well, Tylenol.
6871640	6872640	Evasive.
6872640	6874640	Can I take evasive action?
6874640	6877640	You take evasive action.
6877640	6880640	You do so with such grace and alacrity.
6880640	6881640	Or maybe not.
6881640	6882640	Let's...
6883640	6886640	With such grace and alacrity.
6887640	6892640	Right as the zeppelin goes crashing into the purple wall of the purple canyon and then explodes
6892640	6899640	in a great fireball, you dodge out of the way and a crumple hole falls to the ground with
6899640	6906640	a clunk and you see three flaming goblins screaming and running out of the hole of this ship.
6906640	6908640	Away from us and toward us.
6908640	6909640	And they're goblins.
6909640	6910640	There's three of them.
6910640	6915640	They're stopped dropping and rolling to try and put out the fire on their bodies, but
6915640	6916640	it's not extinguishing.
6916640	6919640	They were just going to ram us with a zeppelin?
6919640	6920640	No.
6920640	6921640	Who knows, man.
6921640	6923640	Mulrane, take some arrows and shoot those guys down.
6923640	6925640	I draw two arrows.
6925640	6926640	Yes.
6926640	6927640	And I...
6927640	6928640	At the drone?
6928640	6929640	At the goblins.
6929640	6930640	At the goblins.
6930640	6931640	Oh, but they're hurt already.
6931640	6934640	But they're just like the people in the Hindenburg.
6935640	6937640	You know, I don't think I'm...
6937640	6940640	They're goblins on Admiral Darkstar's ship.
6940640	6941640	They're not here to help.
6941640	6942640	They're dying.
6942640	6944640	I don't think I'm chaotic.
6944640	6945640	They're dying.
6945640	6946640	I'm not chaotic good anymore.
6946640	6951640	I take out my cutlass and I start running towards them screaming.
6951640	6952640	Running?
6952640	6954640	We're on a flying fucking...
6954640	6955640	He doesn't fly.
6955640	6956640	He doesn't fly.
6956640	6957640	He doesn't fly.
6957640	6958640	He's not Pegasus.
6958640	6959640	I jump off of him.
6959640	6963640	Can I activate my circle against evil?
6963640	6964640	Sure, that happens.
6964640	6966640	But you're standing still, right?
6966640	6967640	Now?
6967640	6968640	Oh, she's off me now?
6968640	6970640	Well, she was running towards it with the cut, I think.
6970640	6972640	Well, I'm safe.
6972640	6973640	Okay.
6974640	6975640	Yeah, you are.
6975640	6976640	How can I run alongside her?
6976640	6978640	How can I jump back on her?
6978640	6979640	All right.
6979640	6980640	You're on him.
6980640	6985640	And now I'm riding toward the goblins, having activated the circle against evil.
6985640	6986640	All right.
6986640	6987640	This happens.
6987640	6989640	You approach the goblins with your circle.
6989640	6991640	And your circle engulfs the goblins.
6991640	6997640	And the goblins are not bothered somehow, yet still their flesh burns.
6997640	6999640	Can I use multi-attack on them?
6999640	7002640	Sure, you know.
7002640	7003640	Let's do it.
7003640	7005640	So I use multi-attack on them.
7005640	7010640	You stab one directly in the eye with your forehead.
7010640	7012640	I mean, the horn on them.
7012640	7016640	I use my whisper bow to shoot out the other one.
7016640	7017640	All right.
7017640	7018640	What are we doing?
7018640	7028640	It's like we're the fucking DEA outside of Waco, like just picking off fucking fleeing Davidians.
7028640	7030640	Let's just get out of here.
7030640	7034640	Well, they tried to ram us with their zeppelin.
7034640	7035640	They missed.
7035640	7039640	Yeah, the karma has been wrought on them.
7039640	7043640	With the multi-attack, you stab the guy in the eye and he dies.
7043640	7047640	The other guy, you stomp on his head with your hoof and his head pops.
7047640	7050640	God almighty.
7050640	7053640	There's one flaming goblin remaining.
7053640	7055640	Okay, I go over.
7055640	7057640	I ride to the last flaming goblin.
7057640	7060640	I take my water skin out and I douse him and try to save him.
7060640	7062640	Just to ask him some questions.
7062640	7068640	You douse him in the water and his fire goes out, but then it comes back and he's on fire again.
7068640	7070640	I piss on him.
7070640	7071640	All right.
7071640	7074640	It extinguishes the fire and then it comes back.
7074640	7077640	I blow him out like a birthday candle.
7077640	7080640	Nothing happens that time, but I'm doing all this.
7080640	7084640	He stops rolling on the ground and he sits up and he's like, what?
7084640	7088640	I guess I'm okay, but I'm on fire.
7088640	7092640	Scorching, I'm sorry, fray of frost to see if it puts out the fire.
7092640	7093640	It burns.
7093640	7094640	He's like, ah, ah, ah.
7094640	7097640	Yeah, I know, but you're not on fire anymore.
7097640	7098640	I still am, though.
7098640	7099640	He likes being on fire.
7099640	7100640	He's okay being on fire.
7100640	7101640	He's still on fire.
7101640	7102640	You like being on fire?
7102640	7107640	I mean, I don't like it, but it's, I guess, fine.
7107640	7108640	I'm not dead.
7108640	7109640	He's okay.
7109640	7110640	So asking questions.
7110640	7111640	We've never gone this long.
7111640	7114640	We got to figure out a way to...
7114640	7116640	I wanted to kill everybody.
7116640	7118640	I wanted to fight a dragon.
7118640	7121640	You wanted to placate every goblin and dragon you ever met.
7121640	7123640	I wanted to leave.
7123640	7124640	I wanted to leave.
7124640	7125640	All right.
7125640	7127640	And it's been recorded.
7128640	7132640	Then talk to this goblin who almost tried to kill us,
7132640	7136640	or at least was a passenger on a Zeppelin, is on fire.
7136640	7138640	Doesn't hate it.
7138640	7139640	We can't put it on.
7139640	7141640	Yeah, putting him out doesn't work.
7141640	7143640	Can I stuff him in the bag of holding?
7143640	7144640	Yep.
7144640	7146640	I stuff him in the bag of holding.
7146640	7147640	All right.
7147640	7149640	And I go, like, there's a lot of shit in there.
7149640	7151640	Like, a lot of it might be worth something,
7151640	7155640	but you're going to get waterboarded later.
7155640	7157640	Enhanced.
7157640	7158640	Interrogated.
7158640	7159640	All right.
7159640	7162640	Is there anything else on the Zeppelin that survives?
7162640	7165640	I mean, it's about 20 feet off.
7165640	7166640	I go to the Zeppelin.
7166640	7169640	You go to the Zeppelin.
7169640	7171640	You see a flaming sack.
7177640	7179640	I examine the flaming sack.
7179640	7181640	It burns apart before you,
7181640	7184640	and you see small cloth and wooden goods
7184640	7187640	being consumed, but among them you see,
7187640	7189640	untarnished by the flames,
7189640	7192640	a crystalline disk of sorts.
7192640	7195640	Oh, I grabbed that disk and I put it in the robot baby.
7195640	7196640	You do that.
7196640	7197640	What?
7197640	7198640	The robot baby.
7198640	7200640	CD-ROM I'm holding.
7200640	7203640	It makes a crazy noise and starts vibrating,
7203640	7207640	and then it goes unit active, diagnostic complete.
7207640	7209640	Zeppelin!
7209640	7212640	Zeppelin!
7213640	7215640	Zeppelin!
7218640	7220640	We fucking did it.
7220640	7223640	DuBois Brown, everybody.
7223640	7226640	Morgan, what's your last name?
7226640	7227640	Carol?
7227640	7228640	Carol.
7228640	7229640	Morgan Harrell?
7229640	7230640	Yeah.
7230640	7231640	Close enough.
7231640	7233640	Morgan Harrell, everybody.
7233640	7237640	Erin McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, and I'm Jeff Davis.
7237640	7240640	Your mayor is Dan Harmon, as always.
7240640	7244640	I feel like next week's D&D is going to be something fucking spectacular
7244640	7247640	because we activated a robot baby.
7250640	7253640	Sorry if you have work in the morning, sorry.
7254640	7256640	We served breakfast.
