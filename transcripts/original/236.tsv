0	15400	From Esther's Follies in Austin, motherfucking Texas, Harman Town is now in session.
15400	18760	Hello, Shopify Southwest.
18760	23000	Is it me or is it quieter here now?
23000	24000	The crowds are smaller.
24000	25000	It's groovy.
25000	26000	I love it.
26000	27000	Only the sexy people now.
27000	32000	Speaking of sexy people, let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
45000	48000	Can we get more level on these mics?
48000	51000	Let's get my mic up and Spencer's mic up a little bit.
51000	54000	One, two, higher, higher, higher.
54000	57000	I also like South by Southwest.
57000	59000	No, not the music, the microphone.
59000	63000	Well, let's get the music louder, I think, maybe.
63000	64000	Well, fuck it.
64000	67000	Let's bring out Dan Harman, the mayor of Harman Town.
74000	76000	Dan Harman.
78000	79000	Thank you.
79000	80000	Thank you so much.
80000	81000	Thank you.
81000	82000	I feel like I remember being here.
82000	83000	We were here at one point.
83000	85000	Yes, you were.
85000	86000	And you were delightful.
86000	88000	I think I was going through a divorce.
88000	89000	I don't know what was happening.
89000	90000	Also, yeah.
90000	93000	I think we were through the divorce at that point.
93000	95000	Well, that's where the trouble starts.
95000	101000	Because you have the divorce to focus on and then afterwards you're like, wait, I'm miserable.
101000	107000	The unaddressed issue behind the note behind the note, we call it in TV writer's rooms.
107000	109000	Why does Sony want a dog on the show?
109000	111000	Because they think the show sucks.
112000	113000	They don't love dogs.
113000	115000	They hate your show.
115000	117000	That's the note behind the note.
117000	118000	I lost you.
118000	121000	I lost you in 10 seconds.
121000	123000	I've known you since 1994.
123000	124000	You lost me for the first time.
124000	125000	I have no idea what you're talking about.
125000	126000	This show's about alienation.
126000	128000	We're here because we're alienated.
128000	132000	And if you can't relate to an alienated person, then you're a fucking hypocrite.
133000	138000	What I do love about performing here at Estros Follies is that there's always a band right outside.
138000	142000	I can hear them thumping, thumping away at the secessionist movement.
143000	145000	Thumping at the walls of America.
145000	146000	Let me out.
146000	148000	I'm Texas for God's sake.
148000	150000	I want to be free.
150000	152000	Is Texas succeeding or is Austin succeeding from Texas?
152000	158000	Austin is the capital of the intelligent secessionist movement.
158000	163000	You go to Dallas and Houston and you have people who are just doing it because they're racist.
163000	167000	In Austin they're doing it because they're into the fucking pogs.
169000	172000	I told them I have a bad feeling about this show.
174000	176000	I think it's going to get worse.
177000	179000	I don't have to prepare for this stuff.
179000	180000	There's a rapist in the White House.
180000	181000	All right.
182000	185000	I wake up in the morning, I'm like, should I brush my teeth?
185000	186000	I don't know.
186000	187000	There's a rapist in the White House.
187000	190000	He fucked a 13-year-old girl in front of Jeff Epstein.
190000	191000	They recorded it.
191000	194000	They flushed it into a fucking space vacuum.
194000	195000	You don't have to...
195000	196000	What?
197000	199000	Am I unfounded in my accusations?
199000	204000	Am I some kind of crazy person saying microwaves or cameras?
206000	208000	I don't want to be branded a nutbag.
208000	212000	I might end up the most powerful person in the fucking world.
213000	216000	I don't want to misspeak and have people start to think I'm crazy.
216000	218000	They might start voting for me.
218000	223000	They might start giving me piles of money and chanting my name in the streets
223000	228000	if I accidentally say something so fucked up that it taps into the most visceral...
228000	229000	What are you writing?
229000	230000	What are you writing?
231000	233000	Are you a reporter?
234000	235000	Keep talking.
236000	237000	Everything he says is lies.
237000	238000	It's fake.
239000	243000	In advance, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, even if you liked me, it was rigged.
246000	251000	I'm writing down today's date so I know when you were arrested.
254000	255000	What is it, the 13th?
256000	257000	I was at the...
257000	261000	We were delayed due to weather, not extreme weather, normal weather.
261000	262000	Weather changes.
262000	263000	Get over it.
266000	268000	It's a hard line to take.
268000	275000	LAX was enshrouded by a mystical fog and John Carpenter pirates were creeping around with maggots coming out of their eye sockets,
275000	279000	lashing at anyone who wandered too far from the cement.
279000	281000	But it's totally normal.
282000	287000	Our flight was delayed a couple times and so I was in the new United Lounge.
288000	290000	I had to buy a ticket for $60.
291000	297000	I retweeted an infographic that showed you what if the world was 100 people.
298000	299000	Hey Spencer, how are you doing?
299000	300000	Hey guys.
302000	304000	I always forget to involve you.
304000	306000	What if the world was 100 people?
306000	309000	If the world was 100 people, according to this infographic,
310000	316000	one of the people, 1% of the population of the United States, spends over $90 a day.
317000	319000	So I've been monitoring my...
320000	323000	But I'm done with that before I get out of bed.
324000	328000	I pay a publicist $3,000 a month to keep me out of TMZ.
330000	331000	I'm sure the joke's on me.
331000	333000	I'm sure TMZ doesn't want to write anything about me.
334000	337000	But I can't know that unless I stop giving these people $3,000 a month.
338000	340000	That's more than $90 a day right there.
340000	342000	Forget where I get my croissant.
342000	343000	Sure, yeah.
344000	348000	Also, forget the money you paid to learn how to pronounce croissant.
349000	351000	Steve Martin, you son of a bitch.
353000	358000	I paid $60 to get into this lounge, which looked like an Apple store with melon slices.
359000	363000	There was a young lady, she was sitting a few counters away from me.
363000	367000	There was a sea of tables, and they all had the little AC outlets on them.
368000	369000	She had her laptop.
369000	372000	She was kind of a Rachel Maddow, but blonde.
372000	378000	She was statuesque and had a long neck, and she had a Bluetooth in, and she was tapping the laptop.
379000	381000	And she was speaking very loudly about what she was doing.
381000	384000	She was saying, that's not what I want.
384000	386000	What I want is this, and I think it should be this and that.
387000	390000	She was loud, but I noted it, but I didn't have to sit near her.
390000	395000	And she was in a sea of Brazilian, Brazil, as in the movie, the Terry Gilliam movie.
396000	400000	She was in this Brazilian-esque sea of things.
401000	403000	It wasn't like a private area, you know?
404000	407000	There wasn't a fireplace raging next to her.
407000	411000	There wasn't a St. Bernard waiting to save anybody from anything with hot cocoa.
412000	413000	There wasn't?
413000	414000	No.
415000	417000	Because most airports don't just provide that.
417000	418000	Don't be confused now.
418000	424000	But I thought it was really weird because there was a lady that came by who was, like, vacuuming and picking things up.
424000	428000	And I always write race-neutral characters, but this woman was black.
428000	433000	And I felt like it was important because she was, like, in her 70s, I felt, and she was African-American.
433000	439000	And as she was picking things up, she leaned over to me into my Minecraft game, and she went,
440000	443000	How come you haven't told that woman to pipe it down?
444000	445000	Whoa!
446000	451000	Which activated this weird Tim Allen instinct in me where I was like, I just wanted her to like me.
451000	454000	So I was like, hey, I've learned to tune out worse than that.
455000	457000	And she's like, I got it.
458000	460000	I'm like, why am I talking? What am I talking about?
461000	464000	What, am I Fred Flintstone? I don't know. I was just playing. I was just like...
464000	466000	It sounds like you're in Act Two of Get Out.
467000	469000	Well, don't spoil that shit. I have to see it.
469000	470000	That's fucking movies.
470000	472000	Also, tell me nothing about season one of Atlanta.
473000	477000	I like how you had a genuine communication with a real human being, and your first instinct was,
477000	479000	What the fuck is going on?
480000	483000	Well, because I was... No, I'm observing myself. I'm going, like, why was I...
484000	486000	There's a person that works for the airport saying,
487000	491000	Why haven't you, fellow consumer, told her to shut the fuck up?
492000	498000	And my response was neither, because, madam, she has a right to be a human.
499000	503000	Nor was it, like, you're right. Chomp, chomp, chomp. Shut up, madam.
503000	505000	Nor was it you tell her.
506000	508000	No, it was the best. It was the right option.
508000	510000	I took the path of least resistance through...
510000	512000	Plato could have predicted my path.
512000	517000	Fucking Steam, shooting through the only opening available, that turned me into a weird 80s comic.
518000	521000	Like, lamenting my, like, oh, the old ball and chain.
521000	524000	Like, I made up a fictional stepmom at home.
525000	527000	I'm like, why don't I tune out worse than that?
527000	528000	Yeah.
528000	529000	What am I talking about?
529000	532000	You're just being nice to a person who said something to you.
532000	535000	I just don't want the person that's talking to me to beat me up.
535000	537000	That person I don't want to beat me up.
538000	540000	I was tuning her out. I did everything.
540000	543000	So here's what... So then that woman, she walked away. I was like, fucking nailed it with her.
543000	544000	Yeah, you did.
544000	546000	She loves me. She loves me. She loves me.
546000	550000	She's like, I hear that. I vacuum, vacuum, pick, pick.
551000	555000	And so I'm like, fucking nailed it today. I really... I made someone like me.
556000	560000	So then this... And then moments after that, this old guy walks up.
560000	563000	And because I've done non-race-neutral casting, I'll tell you, this is like a...
563000	569000	It's kind of like a 90-year-old Michael Chiklis, like, walks up to this woman.
569000	571000	It's like, couldn't be 30 seconds later.
571000	580000	And this, like, seven-foot-tall, like, Rachel Maddow giraffe woman on her laptop is just going on.
580000	586000	She's just... I think she's just in a zone. She's just explaining what spreadsheets work and what don't.
586000	593000	And this guy just goes like... And he goes, excuse me. You might keep an egg down.
593000	601000	And this woman's like, fucking flips out. Like, I mean, flips out like she had no idea.
601000	605000	She wasn't like, blah, blah, blah. I don't care about anybody.
605000	610000	It was more like, blah, blah, blah. I haven't thought about anybody.
610000	612000	Like, there's a difference, you know?
612000	614000	She didn't realize that she was being disruptive.
614000	616000	Well, you know, when you're on a phone, that's the thing.
616000	618000	And there's also like a heightened... Like, I don't know.
618000	621000	Sometimes when you see someone on a phone, you're like, I don't know.
621000	625000	We get a hair trigger. Like, that person didn't have a phone in their hand
625000	627000	and they were just talking to their friend that loudly.
627000	630000	When would you go over to them and be all high-handed about it?
630000	634000	Like, we got a license when cell phones were invented to start getting real fucking dicky.
634000	638000	And, you know, like... And it's justifiable because I'm not...
638000	640000	You know, no heroes, no villains. Just nobody beat me up.
640000	643000	That's the point of my story. Nobody beat me up.
643000	645000	This guy goes like... He goes...
645000	648000	He goes...
648000	650000	My lawn is here. I shake my kingdom.
650000	652000	Moonlight shouldn't have won a la-la land.
652000	656000	Like, I couldn't hear what he said, but he was just like...
656000	658000	And this... And this, like...
658000	660000	And Rachel Manow woman went...
660000	664000	She fucking, like... I was like watching peripherally
664000	667000	because I'm not going to turn my head because someone will beat me up.
667000	670000	But I was just like... She was like...
670000	673000	Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
673000	676000	I'm sorry. Stacy, stop. Wait. No. I'm sorry.
676000	678000	And the guy was like...
678000	680000	It's just rude to see...
680000	682000	What?
682000	685000	I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Like, her voice was cracking.
685000	688000	And she packed up her shit,
688000	690000	put her laptop in her bag,
690000	692000	put her bag in her wheelie,
692000	694000	put her wheelie into transformer mode,
694000	696000	took her fucking overcoat,
696000	699000	tucked into the London fog and phased out.
699000	702000	Like, she went to a different lounge at a different airport
702000	705000	and may have hung herself. I don't know.
705000	708000	Like, she...
708000	711000	She wasn't... She wasn't doing anything that wrong.
711000	715000	Would 90-year-old Michael Chiklis have walked up to a guy and done that?
715000	717000	I think the answer is absolutely not.
717000	720000	I think he felt empowered to walk up to a woman and say,
720000	722000	you're being loud.
722000	725000	That's male privilege bullshit right there.
725000	728000	That is the tennis net...
728000	732000	That's the tennis court net that, like,
732000	734000	some balls hit it and go straight up.
734000	737000	Like, that guy, the answer maybe,
737000	740000	he would have loved... He would have done it twice as fast.
740000	744000	If he saw another old bald white guy doing that,
744000	746000	he wouldn't have fucking done it.
746000	750000	Every airport lounge has, like, two old guys doing exactly that.
750000	753000	Well, more importantly, that's how old guys talk without a phone.
753000	755000	Right, yeah.
755000	757000	They're like, ah, do you remember the Depression?
757000	759000	I can't hear anything.
759000	761000	Their life is their phone.
761000	765000	You know what they call that? They call it Harmontown.
765000	767000	Old white guys yelling.
767000	769000	I don't know.
769000	772000	I've been in restaurants where I've been annoyed by people on the phone.
772000	775000	I've been in restaurants where I've seen someone on the phone
775000	779000	and the person that's more annoyed by the person on the phone,
779000	781000	I'm more annoyed by them.
781000	783000	That they're taking more attention.
783000	786000	It's like, the person is technically on the phone.
786000	790000	It's not really a license for you to vent your antipathy.
790000	794000	Your fucking inhumanity.
794000	796000	I don't know what my point is.
796000	798000	No, I had no point. It's just a little story.
798000	800000	It's just a journalist.
800000	802000	I had a good moment in an airport lounge.
802000	808000	I was flying to Vancouver and I was up in the Air Canada lounge at LAX
808000	811000	and I sat down because I could plug in my phone
811000	815000	and there was a guy with his, I would assume, girlfriend
815000	819000	and talking at the top of his lungs about nothing.
819000	821000	So I was like, just a motherfucker. He's never going to stop talking.
821000	823000	So I unplugged and I went somewhere else.
823000	826000	And there was another guy. He was Australian, which is worse.
826000	829000	Because when a loud, rich guy is Australian,
829000	831000	I was like, you know what?
831000	834000	It's, it's, it's...
834000	836000	I was making a movie.
836000	838000	I was making a movie, right?
838000	840000	If you want to find me, you can count more.
840000	842000	I fucking mucky-tucky-tucky-mucky-mucky-tucky.
842000	845000	I was like, I'm going to fucking blow my brains out.
845000	847000	The views of this podcast do not reflect...
847000	852000	Look, that is a huge continent that will be radiation safe in the event of a nuclear war.
852000	854000	No, they fucking... Dan, we were there.
854000	856000	I love them. We were there.
856000	858000	They have lots of lumber and gas and water.
858000	860000	We know them. We love them.
860000	862000	But they all know what the rich guy sounds like.
862000	865000	And every country knows what the rich white guy sounds like.
865000	869000	And there's a particular Australian rich white guy thing that happens.
869000	871000	And while that was happening, I was like, fuck.
871000	873000	Now there's nowhere to go. Now I'm a prisoner.
873000	877000	Because I found the only other place where I don't have to hear that guy.
877000	880000	And this guy would not stop talking about himself.
880000	885000	And right in the middle of my sadness, Sarah Silverman walks up and sits down right by me.
885000	886000	She says, hey, Jeff.
886000	889000	And she started telling me stories about her and Tom Cruise together.
889000	891000	And that guy had to hear her Tom Cruise stories.
891000	894000	And he went, he shut right the fuck up.
894000	897000	I was like, yeah, motherfucker. We have better stories over here.
897000	900000	We're funny people.
900000	905000	We're not yelling them because we go on TV and talk about them.
905000	907000	We have an antenna.
907000	910000	And Sarah told better stories than this guy.
910000	912000	And it made me very happy.
912000	916000	And then we killed him. Then we killed him.
916000	918000	My therapist has taught me.
918000	925000	So here's the thing I've learned that's been very, very powerful to me.
925000	928000	In moments when people want an apology from me,
928000	932000	which I used to interpret as them trying to leverage me.
932000	934000	They're manipulating me.
934000	936000	What's going to exchange here?
936000	938000	Is this an apology window?
938000	940000	I can still feel all of that.
940000	942000	I can still look at somebody and go, oh, you're a vampire.
942000	943000	You're a piece of shit.
943000	945000	You're just trying to suck energy out of my body.
945000	949000	But my therapist explained to me, she said,
949000	953000	Dan, you are vigilant against abuse.
953000	959000	You cannot handle somebody accusing you of abuse.
959000	962000	You can handle people telling you that you hurt them.
962000	967000	If you went like this and you felt like a soft splat
967000	969000	as you were reaching for your backpack
969000	972000	and you turned and looked and someone's nose was bleeding,
972000	977000	you would not be offended by that person's claim that you had hurt them.
977000	983000	You would stop at nothing to make it up to them.
983000	989000	If that person started to imply, as you apologize,
989000	991000	that you had done it on purpose
991000	994000	or that you had done it because you weren't a good person,
994000	998000	that you had made a choice earlier that day to ignore their needs
998000	1001000	and things like that, you'd start to get triggered.
1001000	1004000	You'd start to get defensive.
1004000	1007000	There's an irony that happens there every day in every bar.
1007000	1010000	Somebody hurts somebody and then someone feels bad about it
1010000	1013000	and then someone is like, oh, I feel bad about this
1013000	1015000	and I feel so bad about it because it seems like
1015000	1017000	you don't fucking give a shit about me.
1017000	1020000	And then the other person is like, how dare you accuse me
1020000	1023000	of being the kind of person that doesn't give a shit about anyone,
1023000	1026000	you fucking lesbian.
1026000	1028000	That took a weird turn.
1028000	1031000	It always takes a weird turn.
1031000	1033000	That is the thing.
1033000	1036000	What I am just slowly starting to realize
1036000	1039000	is that people saying that you hurt them,
1039000	1042000	they're not saying you abused them.
1042000	1044000	They're saying they got hurt.
1044000	1046000	And it doesn't matter what they say beyond that.
1046000	1048000	They can put all the frosting they want on it
1048000	1051000	because they're coming from wherever they're coming from.
1051000	1054000	They can't make you an abuser.
1054000	1056000	They can say that they're hurt
1056000	1059000	and everyone can apologize for hurting people
1059000	1063000	and everybody should be vigilant against admitting they're an abuser
1063000	1066000	because if you're not a fucking abuser, that's an important thing.
1066000	1070000	There are a couple people among us who fucking love abusing people.
1070000	1073000	We should definitely separate from them.
1073000	1076000	I'm just noticing in these daily exchanges,
1076000	1078000	I'm like, wait a minute, I'm trying to take a step back
1078000	1080000	and going like, okay, wait, you're hurt.
1080000	1082000	I hurt you, I hurt you.
1082000	1084000	I did not abuse you.
1084000	1086000	I'm not an abuser. I'm a herder.
1086000	1089000	I hurt you.
1089000	1092000	Well, we all have.
1092000	1094000	I'm assuming you have too.
1094000	1096000	What if you did abuse somebody?
1096000	1099000	I do it all the time.
1099000	1102000	That abuse is self-pity and things like that.
1102000	1105000	I mean to Cody, look at the text and go,
1105000	1109000	oh, I'm trying to do something here
1109000	1111000	that has nothing to do with her well-being
1111000	1113000	and everything to do with mine.
1113000	1116000	I'm actually hurting her on purpose.
1116000	1118000	Willfully, which is abuse.
1118000	1120000	Yeah.
1120000	1123000	We need to recognize when we're doing that
1123000	1126000	so that we can apologize when we accidentally hurt people
1126000	1129000	because that shouldn't be that big a deal.
1129000	1131000	There's eight billion of us walking around.
1131000	1132000	We're going to step on each other's feet.
1132000	1134000	I think for you though,
1134000	1137000	not just for you, but for you especially
1137000	1140000	because you have the ability to seem abusive
1140000	1142000	when you're not being abusive.
1142000	1144000	Thank you.
1144000	1146000	Weird thing to love.
1146000	1150000	You are so good verbally.
1150000	1154000	I've seen you lay people out with a quip, with a line.
1154000	1156000	Because they're accusing me of abusing them.
1156000	1159000	And I need them to know that they're a piece of fucking shit.
1160000	1162000	The problem is you're really good at that.
1162000	1164000	Thank you.
1164000	1166000	That's what I'm saying.
1166000	1168000	You're the Robin Hood in terms of archery
1168000	1171000	of hitting the bullseye when someone goes,
1171000	1173000	hey, fuck off buddy.
1173000	1176000	And you just shoot an arrow right into their heart.
1176000	1178000	If you imply that I hurt you on purpose,
1178000	1180000	I will strangle you to death.
1180000	1183000	I will wrap my hands around your neck until you're dead
1183000	1185000	and you can't say it ever again.
1185000	1187000	Your gifts are your curses.
1187000	1188000	You're a good writer.
1188000	1191000	And so you're also really good at hurting people's feelings.
1191000	1193000	Thank you.
1193000	1195000	Stop saying thank you to them.
1195000	1197000	Say, oops.
1197000	1199000	No, but I'm being glib.
1199000	1201000	But what I'm saying is yes.
1201000	1203000	But you love it because you feel a reward.
1203000	1205000	I'm learning about that in therapy.
1205000	1208000	What happens is being yourself following your own bliss,
1208000	1211000	you can sometimes be hurtful to people
1211000	1215000	that is not the same crime as being abusive to someone.
1215000	1217000	We all commit both of those crimes.
1217000	1221000	Hurtfulness often comes with thoughtlessness, carelessness.
1221000	1223000	You weren't thinking about me
1223000	1226000	when you changed lanes on the freeway.
1226000	1230000	It's different than you thinking you're entitled
1230000	1232000	to just drive however you want.
1232000	1234000	There's shades of abuse there
1234000	1236000	where you're just like, fuck everyone on the freeway.
1236000	1240000	When we get down and fight
1240000	1242000	when we start arguing with each other,
1242000	1244000	those rare moments when we're actually able
1244000	1248000	to connect with each other and we find out truly
1248000	1250000	what everyone is always saying the whole time,
1250000	1252000	which is I didn't mean to do that.
1252000	1254000	I didn't mean it that way.
1254000	1256000	That's not how I meant it.
1256000	1259000	That always turns everything around.
1259000	1262000	Well, the problem that you face is that
1262000	1267000	when you react and you accidentally fling an elbow verbally
1267000	1272000	and hurt somebody's feelings is that you're so succinct
1272000	1275000	and it's so well written, it sounds meditative.
1275000	1277000	It doesn't sound...
1277000	1280000	You're pumping me up so that everyone drives home tonight going,
1280000	1282000	I don't see what Jeff was seeing in him.
1282000	1284000	No, no, no.
1284000	1286000	I've seen you...
1286000	1289000	If somebody hits you below the knee and your foot flies up,
1289000	1293000	when somebody hits you and you respond,
1293000	1295000	it sounds so good.
1295000	1297000	It sounds abusive.
1297000	1299000	But it wasn't. It was just you reacting.
1299000	1301000	It was just a reflex.
1301000	1303000	It was hurting people.
1303000	1305000	It's as simple as protecting yourself.
1305000	1307000	There's airlocks all around us.
1307000	1309000	You lock somebody, you put a wall between you and them
1309000	1312000	and then you hit a button and then you just watch them die.
1312000	1317000	You just stare at them while they turn purple
1317000	1319000	and you go, like, what?
1319000	1322000	I thought you wanted to be near me.
1322000	1327000	Go see Get Out in Theatre. It's a fantastic film.
1327000	1330000	But yeah, we're looking into all those things.
1331000	1334000	You have the curse of being good at hurting people's feelings
1334000	1338000	and it sounds like it's a neutron bomb.
1338000	1340000	It's not a gift.
1340000	1345000	We watch movies about mafia people and serial killers
1345000	1348000	and things because we're fascinated with that behavior
1348000	1351000	because it's not a gift, but it is rare
1351000	1354000	because our species is predisposed to compassion.
1354000	1358000	It's weird when somebody's circuits are so fucked up
1358000	1362000	that it could actually hurt somebody so meticulously, so horribly.
1362000	1365000	We focus on it because we don't want it to happen anymore.
1365000	1369000	It's like ribbons and flowers spread at an intersection
1369000	1371000	where a little girl got hit by a car.
1371000	1375000	We go to the point of the pain and we watch it.
1375000	1379000	We look at it and we go, here's where this happened.
1379000	1381000	Should we bring out Doug Benson?
1385000	1387000	We don't have Doug Benson do it.
1387000	1388000	He might be gone.
1388000	1389000	He was just backstage.
1389000	1390000	Doug is here?
1390000	1391000	Yeah, yeah.
1391000	1392000	For real?
1392000	1393000	He's coming.
1393000	1394000	He was just backstage.
1394000	1395000	I didn't know Doug was here.
1395000	1396000	I didn't either.
1396000	1399000	I saw him backstage and I thought I'd...
1399000	1401000	Doug Benson!
1410000	1412000	Grab a seat, stand up, do what you like.
1412000	1414000	Wherever you're comfortable.
1414000	1416000	I like this. I like having you on my shoulder like that.
1416000	1418000	I'll give you a nice little rub over here.
1418000	1420000	Yeah, Jeff is my angel on my shoulder.
1420000	1422000	I'm your Michael Landon.
1422000	1425000	Do some quick fact checking on everything I say.
1425000	1428000	I'm having a great time here in Austin.
1428000	1429000	Lies.
1429000	1431000	Lies.
1431000	1432000	What happened?
1432000	1434000	Who did you wrong in Austin already?
1434000	1436000	Oh, that's a great question.
1436000	1438000	There has to be somebody.
1438000	1440000	Last night there was a guy.
1440000	1443000	I was just walking down the street minding my own business
1443000	1446000	guy in front of one of the bars.
1446000	1447000	He goes, hey, Doug Benson.
1447000	1449000	I'm like, hey, man, how's it going?
1449000	1450000	And he goes...
1450000	1451000	I go, you got food in there?
1451000	1453000	Because I was looking for somewhere to eat.
1453000	1454000	You got food in this bar?
1454000	1456000	He goes, no, but the bar next door has food.
1456000	1459000	I'm going to pick up your meal and all of your drinks.
1459000	1461000	I'm going to take care of it for you.
1461000	1463000	And I was like, that's awesome.
1463000	1465000	And then we go into this place next door.
1465000	1466000	He introduces me to everybody.
1466000	1469000	And then I've got a friend that's not going to leave while I
1469000	1471000	eat the free food and drink the free drinks.
1471000	1474000	And it's going to get weirder and weirder as the thing goes
1474000	1477000	along to the point where you finally have to be like, hey,
1477000	1479000	man, all right.
1479000	1481000	I can buy my own food.
1481000	1484000	I didn't know that that was going to be part of the deal is
1484000	1489000	that I've got like a new friend for life, you know, who keeps
1489000	1490000	offering me Molly.
1490000	1492000	And I'm like, dude, I'm a weed guy.
1492000	1493000	For real?
1493000	1497000	Yeah, he kept saying he had a list of things that I could have
1497000	1498000	instead of weed.
1498000	1499000	And I was like, no, weed is good.
1499000	1502000	The drug that makes everyone have the same personality and
1502000	1504000	vow to stay in touch more often.
1504000	1508000	It's weird that that was his drug of choice.
1508000	1511000	So, yeah, so I think ultimately he might have been a little
1511000	1515000	disgruntled, like he expected more for buying me some chips
1515000	1518000	and queso and a couple of vodka sodas.
1518000	1522000	I had an encounter at the hotel bar that it occurs to me I've
1522000	1526000	had 25 times in the last five years at least, which I hadn't
1526000	1527000	noticed.
1527000	1529000	And so I don't know what the actual count is, but it seems
1529000	1530000	like this happens all the time.
1530000	1532000	And I have talked about encounters like this on the
1532000	1540000	podcast where a person that, like, a person is projecting
1540000	1541000	their...
1541000	1549000	Jeff is upstaging you with a dab behind the ears of vodka gag.
1549000	1552000	It's so weird to get a big laugh with a physical gag on an
1552000	1555000	audio podcast.
1555000	1558000	Everyone is like, what is Dan saying right now that's so
1558000	1559000	hilarious?
1559000	1562000	He's just setting up a premise at this point.
1562000	1565000	It's like in that bear movie where the baby bear goes roar
1565000	1568000	and then the Puma is like, yikes.
1568000	1572000	And then there's a big bear behind it.
1572000	1574000	I didn't see the movie.
1574000	1576000	I assume that happened in it.
1576000	1577000	Wait a second.
1577000	1581000	Which one of us is high right now?
1581000	1582000	I'm on Molly.
1582000	1585000	I just wanted to see you more often.
1585000	1589000	I sat at the hotel bar and I was listening to this...
1589000	1591000	There was a lady next to me and she was talking to the
1591000	1594000	bartender and they were talking about...
1594000	1596000	They were talking about South by Southwest and they were
1596000	1597000	talking about...
1597000	1600000	They both knew each other because she drinks there a lot
1600000	1603000	and she works in real estate and so she's a big mover and
1603000	1606000	shaker and she's always at the hotel bar and he knows who
1606000	1609000	she is and they know each other.
1609000	1611000	But not that well...
1611000	1613000	They start talking about South by Southwest and they're
1613000	1614000	like, yeah.
1614000	1617000	They start talking about how many famous people are in
1617000	1620000	Austin this time of year and it's like, oh, it's like
1620000	1622000	Hollywood all of a sudden.
1622000	1624000	This time of year, all of a sudden there's all these
1624000	1628000	famous people and her big example was what she called
1628000	1632000	the guy from the league.
1632000	1634000	And I was just like taken by that and I was like,
1634000	1636000	learn his name.
1636000	1637000	It's the league.
1637000	1639000	And there's like five of them to choose from.
1639000	1640000	I know.
1640000	1641000	The guy from the league?
1641000	1643000	I was just like, what?
1643000	1644000	The guy from the league?
1644000	1647000	And I swear she brought her phone.
1647000	1648000	She was like, yeah, no, I know.
1648000	1649000	Have you ever seen the league?
1649000	1650000	And he's like, no, I have not.
1650000	1651000	And she's like, no.
1651000	1654000	This guy from the league, I think she had a photo of him
1654000	1655000	on his phone.
1655000	1656000	I don't know.
1656000	1658000	It's like, wait, so it's a device you could use to
1658000	1659000	Google him.
1659000	1661000	Just say the guy from the league.
1661000	1664000	I'm not saying respect our craft.
1664000	1667000	I'm just saying, like, it's part of a conversation
1667000	1670000	where you're yes-anding his assertion that it's like
1670000	1671000	Hollywood around here.
1671000	1672000	Yes, I agree.
1672000	1674000	Famous people everywhere.
1674000	1676000	For instance, the guy from the league.
1676000	1678000	She didn't know who the fuck.
1678000	1679000	Learn his name.
1679000	1683000	Could be anyone from a basic cable TV show that is
1683000	1685000	finished, I believe.
1685000	1688000	So then my burger comes.
1688000	1690000	The final at bat happened.
1690000	1692000	It was baseball, right?
1693000	1696000	Yeah, it was organized around a...
1696000	1697000	Was it Casey?
1697000	1699000	I think they played Dungeons and Dragons.
1699000	1700000	I don't know.
1700000	1703000	Welcome to the four guys who don't know anything
1703000	1705000	about sports podcast.
1707000	1709000	But then she...
1709000	1711000	That's every podcast but the Squars.
1711000	1712000	Every podcast, yeah.
1712000	1715000	But then, so then my burger comes.
1715000	1718000	And I go, do you have any mustard?
1720000	1721000	Here we go.
1721000	1722000	Wait for it.
1722000	1724000	Do you have any mustard?
1724000	1725000	That's what I said.
1725000	1727000	Do you have any mustard?
1727000	1730000	Which, Dan, in Texas is a very provocative question.
1730000	1733000	And the guy, the kid, I'm gonna call him a kid,
1733000	1737000	behind the bar, said, we have mustard,
1737000	1738000	but it's Dijon.
1738000	1740000	It's not yellow.
1740000	1743000	Now, I took that as a kindred spirit.
1743000	1745000	I was like, fucking A, yeah.
1745000	1747000	I said, it's all right.
1747000	1749000	I'm used to it.
1750000	1752000	He goes back to talking to her.
1752000	1755000	And then I'm like, I think, well,
1755000	1757000	he's gonna get the brown mustard.
1757000	1758000	So I just offer up.
1758000	1759000	I go like, yeah.
1759000	1765000	I mean, I was at a restaurant recently
1765000	1767000	where they had yellow mustard on the table
1767000	1769000	and it kind of blew my mind.
1769000	1772000	And he and she both look at me
1772000	1775000	with a combination of curiousness,
1775000	1778000	curiosity, I think they call it,
1778000	1780000	and disgust.
1780000	1784000	Just like the vermouth and the dry martini
1784000	1786000	is just disgust.
1786000	1788000	Disgust, if you pour a glass of it,
1788000	1789000	then you're the bad guy.
1789000	1792000	If you just fucking run it around the rim,
1792000	1794000	yeah, I'm disgusted with how curious I am.
1794000	1797000	What the fuck are you talking about?
1797000	1799000	What the fuck?
1799000	1801000	What the fuck are you babbling about?
1801000	1803000	Think about what you said in effect was,
1803000	1806000	hi, I have a lot of opinions on mustard.
1807000	1809000	That's your relationship with them at this point.
1809000	1811000	Well, I'm not shocked you'd take their side.
1811000	1814000	I don't, but I'm just, I'm forensically,
1814000	1815000	I'm breaking this down.
1815000	1818000	No, I'm aware of the fact, I looked over it
1818000	1822000	and thought, I think what he might have heard was,
1822000	1827000	it's okay that I have no yellow mustard or any mustard.
1827000	1829000	I'm used to having no mustard.
1829000	1832000	Like I'm Harry Potter before Hogwarts enrolled him.
1832000	1835000	Like, I'm sorry, I don't deserve mustard.
1835000	1836000	I'm okay with it.
1836000	1838000	Like, okay, fine.
1838000	1839000	He's allowed to interpret it that way.
1839000	1840000	But it was weird.
1840000	1842000	They both looked at me in a way that brought me back
1842000	1844000	to the sixth grade playground where it was just like,
1844000	1847000	I'd like to contribute to the conversation.
1847000	1851000	And they're just like, ew, gross, so gross.
1851000	1852000	You're so gross.
1852000	1854000	You're such a gross monster.
1854000	1856000	Ew, what are you talking about?
1856000	1857000	Talking about mustard much?
1857000	1859000	You're gross.
1859000	1862000	And then they just went back to talking about real estate,
1862000	1864000	which is so fucking cool.
1865000	1866000	Because it's Texas.
1866000	1869000	There's lots of real estate.
1869000	1871000	And he never brought you your mustard?
1871000	1874000	He never brought fucking mustard.
1874000	1878000	And over time, my burger tasted better with the inhumanity on it.
1878000	1881000	I was like, I'm not going to fucking play this game.
1881000	1884000	I'm not going to be uppity and say, like,
1884000	1886000	I asked for mustard earlier.
1886000	1888000	I'm just like, mmm, good burger.
1888000	1890000	Called his fucking bluff.
1890000	1891000	Here's what happened.
1892000	1893000	She settles up.
1893000	1894000	She walks away.
1894000	1900000	She's got real estate to sell for you video subscribers.
1900000	1903000	That was me dabbing more vodka behind my ears.
1904000	1908000	This guy goes, he goes, so what are you doing in town?
1908000	1911000	What's your schedule like?
1911000	1913000	I didn't start a conversation with this fucking guy.
1913000	1914000	What hotel?
1914000	1916000	What room number?
1916000	1919000	I said, I'm going to Esther's Follies.
1919000	1922000	He's like, yeah, for what?
1924000	1926000	Just to see the show, it's really good.
1926000	1927000	Comedy show.
1927000	1929000	The Esther's Follies show is great.
1929000	1930000	The Esther's Follies show is great.
1930000	1932000	Still doing that over there?
1932000	1936000	This guy's on a road so high, it's untenable.
1936000	1938000	Like, it's ridiculous.
1938000	1941000	But I just don't want to get yelled at.
1941000	1943000	I just don't want to get beaten up.
1943000	1946000	And I just want to settle up.
1946000	1947000	I'd like to settle up.
1947000	1948000	Let me settle up.
1948000	1950000	What are you doing over there?
1950000	1952000	I'm doing a couple of shows.
1952000	1953000	I'm doing a couple of shows.
1953000	1955000	Yeah, what shows?
1955000	1956000	He won't stop.
1956000	1959000	Because you can't crucify with one nail.
1959000	1962000	The person would fall off.
1962000	1964000	You'd be guilty of a minor felony.
1964000	1965000	You'd have wounded a hand.
1965000	1966000	I'm writing that down.
1966000	1967000	Crucifixion requires...
1967000	1969000	That's our episode title for certain.
1969000	1970000	...co-linear fucking...
1970000	1971000	You need the feet?
1971000	1972000	You need the hands?
1972000	1973000	Physicists have studied it.
1973000	1975000	So I was like, well, what show?
1975000	1978000	And I'm like, well, I'm doing a podcast.
1978000	1984000	And he was like, uh-huh, I got it.
1984000	1985000	Great.
1985000	1986000	Charged it to my room.
1986000	1987000	Signed it.
1987000	1988000	I was like, what's the other show?
1988000	1989000	Jesus fucking Christ.
1989000	1991000	Are you fucking kidding me?
1991000	1992000	Another podcast.
1992000	1994000	You shut it down.
1994000	1999000	I said, it's promoting a show on...
1999000	2003000	CISO?
2003000	2004000	CISO.
2004000	2005000	CISO.
2005000	2009000	Twists his face like a fucking pig's cock.
2009000	2012000	Like, Beetlejuice special effect.
2012000	2016000	Like, I can't let you know enough that I have no idea where you work.
2016000	2021000	I don't pretend to think anyone knows what the fuck CISO is.
2021000	2023000	Thank you for coming on the show, by the way.
2023000	2024000	Oh, you're welcome.
2024000	2025000	But...
2025000	2026000	And then he goes...
2026000	2029000	And then he finally goes, he goes, like, well, what's that show?
2029000	2031000	And I said, it's promoting a show.
2031000	2034000	It's eye-playing Dungeons & Dragons.
2034000	2037000	And he's like, ugh, his eyes, muscles.
2037000	2039000	I'm gonna kill this fucking guy.
2039000	2045000	He's gonna get no Trumpcare from his fucking, like, muscles detaching from the eyes rolling back into his head.
2045000	2050000	And he's polishing a glass, like there's anyone else coming in.
2050000	2053000	Like the robot in Passengers.
2053000	2055000	Wait, can we talk about that movie?
2055000	2056000	What the fuck?
2056000	2057000	I just saw that movie.
2057000	2060000	He turned into Burt Kreiser right there.
2060000	2061000	What the fuck is that?
2061000	2062000	What the fuck is that?
2062000	2063000	What?
2063000	2064000	That movie.
2064000	2066000	He waits all the time and then he wakes up.
2066000	2067000	I was making the joke.
2067000	2071000	What if the rest of the podcast was hidden falsetto?
2071000	2072000	You realize I would...
2072000	2078000	I love Southwest because I like waiting in lights.
2078000	2084000	Also, the owner of a white Toyota, you're a double protest side.
2084000	2088000	But that movie, do you realize, like, the third act of that movie, I don't know if anyone...
2088000	2089000	I know everyone's like...
2089000	2092000	Who's worried about having Passengers spoiled?
2092000	2093000	Nobody.
2093000	2095000	Nobody gives a shit.
2095000	2097000	You've probably seen the blogs about why it's...
2097000	2098000	It's a fucked up thing.
2098000	2102000	Yeah, the only reason to watch it is if you like those two actors and you, you know, want to...
2102000	2105000	Like, it'd be sexy for you to see them in space.
2105000	2107000	And you feel like everything is cheap.
2107000	2109000	You know, like, I think it's only jerk off material.
2109000	2118000	It's like if Sleepless in Seattle was about Tom Hanks buying night vision goggles and, you know, just living in Meg Ryan's apartment for a while.
2119000	2123000	Just watching her from a cupboard.
2123000	2124000	And then finally deciding...
2124000	2125000	Only when she sleeps.
2125000	2127000	He watches her when she's sleeping.
2127000	2128000	And if instead of a kid...
2128000	2129000	And he googles her.
2129000	2131000	He googles her while she's sleeping.
2131000	2132000	Oh, because that's what he knew.
2132000	2133000	It's true love.
2133000	2136000	I'm like, this is beyond anything.
2136000	2142000	He threw a wine bottle, slipped on it, and the first pair of tins he saw, he was like, I'm googling her.
2142000	2144000	And lo and behold, he's in love with her.
2144000	2147000	Yeah, if he's going to play that creepy play, he should look...
2147000	2150000	He should walk around and look at every sleeping passenger...
2150000	2151000	There should have been.
2151000	2153000	And find the sexiest one to wake up.
2153000	2160000	There needed to be at least one foxy black lady on the ship that he was, like, looking at and going, like, I don't like that fart joke.
2160000	2165000	Like, just show me that you're not racist.
2165000	2166000	But we all...
2166000	2167000	You all wrote your blogs about that.
2167000	2174000	But did you notice that in the third act of that movie, I was making the joke because my girlfriend and I are laughing at it while watching it.
2174000	2181000	They're like, oh, my God, they really think this elephant isn't in the room, like, as it turns into a romance and they're playing Dance Dance Revolution together.
2181000	2184000	Like, they really think we forgot about this thing.
2184000	2187000	Okay, fine, missteps, we're going to miss, whatever.
2187000	2201000	But, like, I was making the joke as we go to the third act, like, as Jennifer Lawrence would have to say, like, to Chris Pratt, like, my God, the ship, it doesn't know what it wants.
2201000	2204000	It needs to be raped, Chris.
2204000	2206000	You need to rape the ship to save us.
2206000	2208000	And I was making that joke.
2208000	2211000	It was true.
2211000	2213000	The act of the fucking ship needed...
2213000	2214000	Didn't know...
2214000	2222000	It had, like, a tube that wouldn't let things out or in and he had to go into it and, like, do you guys not...
2222000	2225000	It's behind...
2225000	2228000	I thought we were talking about trolls.
2229000	2234000	The third act of that movie is a concretization of an argument for no meaning, yes.
2234000	2236000	They say rape the ship?
2236000	2241000	The ship is all blocked up and it needs to just let it go.
2241000	2243000	I've never heard of this movie.
2243000	2248000	He needs to penetrate a tube that does not want to be penetrated.
2248000	2249000	You're not supposed to go in there.
2249000	2250000	He's not supposed to be in there.
2250000	2251000	He goes in there.
2251000	2252000	He goes in there.
2252000	2255000	The movie is clearly anti-ship rape.
2255000	2256000	Well, finally.
2256000	2257000	Yeah.
2257000	2258000	Anyways, so...
2258000	2260000	But then Andy Garcia shows up.
2260000	2261000	Oh, my God.
2261000	2262000	What is that about?
2262000	2263000	He gets top billing.
2263000	2266000	It has to be a movie about being nowhere.
2266000	2269000	He's, like, top billing because he looks in a tree.
2272000	2275000	Again, if you haven't seen Passengers, first of all, don't.
2275000	2280000	And secondly, no, I thought there were parts of it that were all right.
2280000	2283000	It was Oscar-nominated for visual...
2283000	2284000	The beginning was a production design.
2284000	2286000	Doug, you love movies.
2286000	2287000	I do.
2287000	2290000	As your podcast proudly proclaims.
2290000	2292000	Have you seen Get Out?
2292000	2293000	I have not seen Get Out.
2293000	2295000	Go see it in the theater.
2295000	2297000	It's fucking good fun.
2297000	2299000	What if there's nobody else in the theater?
2299000	2302000	Because I like to go to, like, empty matinees.
2302000	2303000	Does that ruin it?
2303000	2304000	Is it more fun with the crowd?
2304000	2308000	I went to a matinee at the Los Feliz 3 in LA, which is usually empty.
2308000	2311000	There was, you know, there was 20, maybe 12 people in there.
2311000	2313000	12 white people?
2313000	2314000	There was no black people.
2314000	2315000	There were no black people.
2315000	2316000	There were no black people.
2316000	2317000	It was Asian and Latino.
2317000	2318000	Oh, okay.
2318000	2319000	Yeah.
2319000	2322000	Sadly, I kind of want to go.
2322000	2325000	I don't know if this is really reductive in being a piece of shit.
2325000	2328000	I want to go to a black neighborhood and watch that movie in the theater.
2328000	2329000	Oh, my God.
2329000	2333000	It would probably be a phenomenal...
2333000	2334000	Oh, shit.
2334000	2335000	Oh, shit.
2335000	2337000	It would be a phenomenal experience.
2337000	2338000	Jesus Christ.
2338000	2339000	There's a black cowboy.
2339000	2341000	You've activated a black cowboy.
2341000	2342000	Okay.
2342000	2343000	Hold up.
2343000	2344000	Hold up.
2344000	2345000	Oh, my God.
2345000	2346000	Westworld, season two.
2346000	2347000	No, no, no.
2347000	2348000	Get the fuck out of here.
2348000	2349000	What's your name, first of all?
2349000	2350000	Anthony Carter.
2350000	2351000	Anthony Carter.
2351000	2352000	Grab a mic, Anthony.
2352000	2353000	Hey, Anthony.
2353000	2354000	Yeah, get in there.
2354000	2355000	It's that easy to be on the show.
2355000	2356000	Join us.
2356000	2358000	South by Southwest 2017.
2358000	2359000	Wow.
2359000	2362000	This is like we're on a coach flight home.
2362000	2363000	Yeah.
2363000	2366000	Now, Anthony, without...
2366000	2367000	Whoa.
2367000	2368000	Jesus.
2368000	2370000	God damn it, man.
2371000	2372000	I'm kidding.
2372000	2373000	I'm kidding.
2373000	2374000	Stop and spreading.
2374000	2375000	I'm kidding.
2375000	2379000	For the listeners that are not watching, we have a very good-looking black man with a
2379000	2382000	fantastic cowboy hat on right now.
2382000	2383000	Yes, indeed.
2383000	2384000	Anthony.
2384000	2389000	Now, without spoiling the movie for Dan or anybody else, because it's a movie that I
2389000	2390000	went in...
2390000	2391000	I didn't know who was in it.
2391000	2392000	I didn't know who directed it.
2392000	2393000	I didn't know what the genre was.
2393000	2396000	I didn't know a fucking thing about it.
2396000	2399000	You just knew that it was a movie that was asking you to leave.
2400000	2404000	I went with my girlfriend and we had a fucking jam.
2404000	2405000	It was good fun.
2405000	2408000	When I left, I said to my girlfriend, guess what?
2408000	2409000	Spoiler.
2409000	2410000	She's white.
2410000	2411000	Yeah.
2413000	2415000	Oh, well, that seems to be...
2415000	2417000	Well, my girlfriend's white, too.
2417000	2418000	She's here somewhere.
2418000	2420000	She might have left me.
2420000	2421000	But here's the thing.
2421000	2422000	Hi, Kristen.
2422000	2426000	When I left, I want to be...
2426000	2430000	I don't want to be the guy that asks all of my black friends what they think about
2430000	2435000	that movie, because then I'm one of the white people in that movie that's asked,
2435000	2438000	do you know Tiger Woods?
2438000	2441000	But the thing is, I do want to know...
2441000	2442000	Did you watch it in the theater?
2442000	2444000	No, I have not seen it either.
2444000	2446000	Why are you a motherfucker?
2446000	2448000	Get out the fucking stage.
2448000	2449000	I want to see the movie.
2449000	2451000	I brought you up for one reason, Anthony Carter.
2451000	2452000	Hey.
2452000	2453000	I wouldn't ask it.
2453000	2454000	Thank you for having me.
2454000	2457000	We're going to go see that movie.
2457000	2458000	Hey, no, no.
2458000	2460000	I know I've seen the previews.
2460000	2462000	No, get the fuck out of the stage.
2462000	2464000	We all saw the previews.
2464000	2466000	Do it, do it, do it, do it.
2466000	2467000	Yeah.
2467000	2468000	Mic drop.
2468000	2469000	Anthony Carter dropped.
2469000	2472000	It was a tasteful mic drop.
2472000	2473000	You usually don't see a mic drop.
2473000	2474000	Have you seen it?
2474000	2475000	All right.
2475000	2477000	His friend has a Rick and Morty shirt on it.
2477000	2478000	There you go.
2478000	2480000	Pick up the...
2480000	2482000	Better hat, better shirt.
2482000	2483000	All right.
2483000	2485000	I want all the white people to listen for me for one second, please.
2485000	2486000	All right.
2486000	2487000	Yeah.
2487000	2488000	What's your name first off?
2488000	2489000	My name is Calvin.
2489000	2490000	Calvin, hello.
2490000	2492000	I'm just writing it down.
2492000	2493000	Sit down.
2493000	2494000	How long is this?
2494000	2495000	Wait.
2495000	2496000	How long is it to hold on for?
2496000	2497000	What do you mean?
2497000	2498000	What?
2498000	2499000	Don't want to hold on.
2499000	2500000	No, no, no.
2500000	2501000	I just wanted to hear your name.
2501000	2502000	Lay it on us.
2502000	2505000	White people, go and see, get out, and get educated.
2505000	2506000	Oh, shit.
2506000	2507000	All right.
2507000	2508000	Oh, shit.
2508000	2509000	The mic's being dropped.
2509000	2510000	No, no, no.
2510000	2511000	Calvin, Calvin.
2511000	2512000	He's got a question.
2512000	2513000	Now, first off...
2513000	2516000	It was a premature mic drop situation.
2516000	2517000	Give us...
2517000	2518000	I really hate when that happens.
2518000	2519000	Right?
2519000	2522000	You don't want that to happen in front of a nice lady.
2522000	2525000	You wait, and then everything...
2525000	2530000	You dropped the mic kind of from pretty high tonight?
2530000	2533000	I thought you were different.
2533000	2535000	Everyone thinks I'm different.
2535000	2538000	So, Calvin, without spoilers, you dug the movie, right?
2538000	2539000	Oh, I loved it, yeah.
2539000	2540000	That's great.
2540000	2543000	And you say white people should go see that movie.
2543000	2545000	Every white person should go see that movie.
2545000	2546000	Yes.
2546000	2548000	It's not a brave stance, though, right?
2548000	2549000	I mean, we're not...
2549000	2550000	It's not controversial.
2550000	2552000	Oh, it's controversial in the best way possible.
2552000	2558000	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that every Somalian needs to see this movie.
2558000	2561000	Well, not just every Somalian, but every Somalian pirate also.
2561000	2562000	Sure.
2562000	2567000	Do you think it has the power to change minds of white, racist people?
2567000	2571000	I think it gives them a power to make them feel more insecure than they already do about it.
2571000	2572000	Oh, nice.
2572000	2573000	I like that.
2573000	2575000	And they should feel that and embrace it right now.
2575000	2576000	We need that right now.
2576000	2577000	See, I walked out of the theater.
2577000	2581000	In a small theater, there was maybe only, again, like 15 people tops in there.
2581000	2582000	I walked out.
2582000	2584000	I was like, that movie was fucked up!
2584000	2587000	And white people turned back and looked at me like...
2587000	2589000	They were bummed out.
2589000	2591000	Okay, I'm sorry.
2591000	2593000	They thought I hated the movie.
2593000	2595000	No, that movie's fucking crazy.
2595000	2598000	Yeah, I had a friend that saw it in Vermont, of all places.
2598000	2599000	Oh, dear heavens.
2599000	2602000	I had a black friend that saw it in Vermont, and he laughed...
2602000	2606000	Your story's getting harder to believe with every detail.
2606000	2609000	There actually are black people living in Vermont.
2609000	2613000	They're named Reggie and Ken.
2613000	2615000	Reggie, Ken, and Dana.
2615000	2618000	He saw it in Vermont, and he laughed the entire time,
2618000	2622000	but all the white people felt pretty uncomfortable, which made it better for him.
2622000	2630000	Did you do it like Robert De Niro came fear laughter at it?
2630000	2631000	No, that movie...
2631000	2632000	Because it's funny as shit.
2632000	2633000	It's really funny.
2633000	2634000	It's funny.
2634000	2636000	It's got a lot of social commentary, but it's smart.
2636000	2639000	That would be the thing that kept me from saying it, is other people being funny.
2639000	2641000	That's what keeps me from watching Atlanta.
2641000	2643000	Yeah, it just makes you mad at it, right?
2643000	2645000	You're just mad the whole time.
2645000	2646000	It's not race.
2646000	2651000	It's like, yeah, I mean, believe me, I watched Blade Among the People.
2652000	2656000	I felt their hatred of vampires.
2656000	2658000	I joined in it, and I loved it.
2658000	2660000	But there's something really interesting about this.
2660000	2662000	I have to drag you down into the fucking murk.
2662000	2663000	You're a stranger.
2663000	2664000	Okay, I'm there.
2664000	2668000	There's an interesting thing about that, because I was telling that story that happens in LAX's lounge, right?
2668000	2672000	So this woman comes up to me, and she gives me these choices.
2673000	2674000	And the...
2680000	2681000	This is really happening.
2681000	2682000	Yeah.
2687000	2688000	Cheers.
2690000	2691000	Sorry about season three.
2691000	2692000	We're drawing it.
2692000	2693000	No, it's...
2693000	2703000	I mean, the Rick Roll thing was pretty nice, in both tortures way possible.
2703000	2704000	It was good.
2704000	2713000	When that woman came up to me at LAX, she's referring to a woman over there, and there's a lot of things on the table,
2713000	2717000	and the weird energy that squirted out of me...
2719000	2721000	That's a nice way to put it.
2721000	2725000	Because, you know, like, Plato studied steam engines, like the platonic engine,
2725000	2728000	where you just heat up a bunch of water, and you only give it so much egress,
2728000	2733000	that if you put it in different positions, you'll make a thing spin around.
2733000	2735000	It's a platonic engine, right?
2735000	2737000	It's like steam escaping.
2737000	2739000	It'll find the nearest escape.
2739000	2741000	It'll find the weakest membrane to squeak through.
2741000	2743000	Now, isn't that membrane's fault?
2743000	2749000	So, for instance, why have we been a misogynistic culture longer than we've been a racist culture?
2749000	2752000	Like, don't get aggravated by my assertion there, but...
2753000	2754000	It's legitimate.
2754000	2758000	Why are we quicker to club women than we are to...
2758000	2765000	Like, why are we so able to overcome pigment before we are able to respect...
2765000	2767000	Is this question for anybody on the panel?
2768000	2772000	I, in a sense, when that woman said to me at the airport, she said,
2772000	2775000	how come you don't tell that woman to shut the fuck up?
2775000	2779000	I said, because of my mother-in-law.
2779000	2781000	You know, like, it was fake.
2781000	2783000	It was like where the...
2783000	2787000	It was an essentially misogynistic, like, valve that that energy went through.
2787000	2792000	I'm like, with women like that, if you think women talking loud's gonna get my goat,
2792000	2795000	you should deal with what I deal with on Christmas Eve.
2795000	2797000	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
2797000	2799000	I was just trying to escape a situation.
2799000	2804000	The steam was so high, that was the weakest membrane.
2804000	2805000	It wouldn't have been...
2805000	2810000	If it was the 1950s, would I have said to that woman, like, bite your tongue, lady.
2812000	2814000	Know your place. Give me cornflakes.
2814000	2815000	Oh, no.
2816000	2819000	That got much worse in the second part.
2820000	2822000	That's my question. Answer it.
2822000	2823000	I think it goes...
2824000	2825000	Oh, fuck.
2825000	2828000	Ten seconds. Nine, eight.
2829000	2833000	I think it comes down to, I mean, just talking about it.
2833000	2836000	And I think a lot of people that feel like misogyny's not a problem,
2836000	2838000	they haven't dealt with it or thought about it
2838000	2841000	or had a woman in their life that actually experienced that.
2841000	2843000	Who doesn't have a woman in their life?
2843000	2846000	That's the thing, I think, to answer your question, Dan,
2846000	2852000	I think misogyny is bigger than racism, I don't know, by what percentage,
2852000	2857000	but I think it's happening because women are 50%,
2857000	2860000	like, women are a bigger threat because there's more of them.
2861000	2864000	And men that are threatened by women are going...
2864000	2866000	You know what I mean? They're going to be threatened
2866000	2869000	because it's half of the people and it's also their mother.
2869000	2872000	It's also their mama is a fucking woman, you know?
2872000	2876000	Because your memories of becoming a man involve becoming abusive to your mother.
2876000	2879000	Like, in a lot of...
2879000	2881000	It's just, shut up, mom, I don't want to do this.
2881000	2884000	Right, and you didn't, as a white kid, you weren't growing up going,
2884000	2885000	shut up, black guy.
2886000	2890000	So it's all directed at women and not race.
2890000	2892000	I like how we've solved that problem.
2892000	2896000	Racism's over, misogyny needs to work on it.
2896000	2898000	We need to bring race back into puberty.
2898000	2901000	I'm so glad there's no women up here to defend themselves right now.
2901000	2903000	Your mom's going to hit you, didn't they?
2904000	2907000	He'll tell women how to deal with this.
2907000	2910000	For all the women in the audience watching a bunch of white dudes,
2910000	2913000	or not white dudes, white dudes minus one,
2913000	2914000	he's close enough...
2914000	2915000	Sit the fuck down.
2915000	2917000	Look at that hat, he's close enough to white.
2917000	2919000	Watching a bunch of men talk about women.
2919000	2921000	Hat and a T-shirt.
2921000	2925000	Yeah, is the guy... his T-shirt is on upside down?
2925000	2927000	You got a shirt on?
2927000	2929000	I don't think you can put a T-shirt on upside down.
2929000	2932000	I'm going to sit up.
2932000	2934000	I mean, you can't, it'd be hard.
2934000	2938000	Yeah, it fits weird.
2938000	2939000	It's more of a tube top.
2939000	2940000	A little tight.
2940000	2942000	Jeff, you got derailed midstream.
2942000	2944000	You were about to incite women to hate the show.
2944000	2946000	Please continue.
2946000	2949000	No, women already hate the show.
2949000	2952000	Watching three men stumble into the realization
2952000	2956000	that this is the easiest thing in the world that always has been
2956000	2961000	is probably just as good for whatever money they paid for their badges
2961000	2964000	as anything.
2966000	2968000	Men can't imagine what it's like to be a woman.
2968000	2970000	We can't. We can think we can. We fucking can't.
2970000	2974000	I'm going to. Watch.
2974000	2976000	Stand back.
2976000	2980000	Spencer, Dungeon Master, me waking up of being a woman.
2980000	2984000	Jeff, play appropriate music.
2984000	2986000	How much time do we have left?
2986000	2987000	We got loads of time.
2987000	2989000	Okay.
2990000	2994000	You wake up in a bedroom.
2994000	2997000	It's empty.
2997000	3000000	Because you make less money than men.
3004000	3005000	I get out of bed.
3005000	3007000	All right.
3007000	3010000	You're still in the bedroom.
3012000	3017000	I put on whatever outfit will walk the line between me being branded a slut
3017000	3022000	and me being dismissed as a human being.
3022000	3025000	You managed to thread the needle once more like millions of women
3025000	3029000	across the earth do every morning of their lives.
3029000	3033000	Slutty outfit.
3033000	3036000	Can I ask what I'm wearing?
3036000	3037000	No.
3037000	3041000	Okay. That's probably a good idea.
3041000	3044000	I go down to get into an Uber.
3044000	3045000	All right.
3045000	3048000	Where I'm certain that someone will simply drive me to work.
3048000	3050000	It's doing the thing where it's like a block away
3050000	3054000	but it's just spinning around for the last five minutes.
3054000	3057000	It shows up and the guy makes no indication
3057000	3061000	that that wasn't supposed to be part of his job.
3061000	3062000	I get in.
3062000	3063000	Oh.
3063000	3066000	He touches you.
3066000	3068000	I file a complaint with Uber.
3068000	3069000	It doesn't matter.
3069000	3072000	He gets promoted to head of Uber.
3076000	3078000	You get to your job or whatever.
3078000	3081000	I get out of the Uber and I run for president.
3081000	3082000	I'm tired of this.
3082000	3083000	I'm tired of this.
3083000	3084000	I'm ending it.
3084000	3085000	I've played nice.
3085000	3086000	I'm running for president.
3086000	3087000	You lose.
3087000	3088000	Yeah.
3088000	3090000	More people hated me than liked me?
3090000	3094000	It turns out you did what you have to do.
3094000	3096000	Are you saying I lost the popular vote?
3096000	3097000	No.
3097000	3098000	That's what's crazy.
3098000	3099000	Oh.
3102000	3103000	And it's hard.
3103000	3105000	You know, you might have won even harder if not for,
3105000	3106000	you know, the striking.
3106000	3107000	Okay.
3107000	3108000	That's too political.
3108000	3109000	Sorry.
3109000	3112000	I was going to talk about the voting rights act.
3113000	3116000	Well, I walk into the woods and I wait for someone to need me.
3116000	3117000	No one.
3117000	3118000	Yeah.
3118000	3120000	No one needs you, but everyone wants something from you.
3120000	3122000	And it's your problem.
3122000	3125000	All the trees are mad.
3128000	3130000	I go up to one of the trees.
3130000	3131000	Okay.
3131000	3133000	It ignores you.
3133000	3136000	I thought I just heard you grumbling things about me being...
3136000	3139000	Why are you being such a bitch?
3139000	3143000	You know, we've been growing here for hundreds of years.
3143000	3148000	No one's coming through being talked about by us before until you.
3148000	3150000	So you're the problem.
3151000	3152000	All right.
3152000	3154000	Go further into the woods.
3154000	3155000	All right.
3155000	3158000	You do that.
3158000	3166000	You find, you know, you're feeling cramping up.
3166000	3168000	You're cramping.
3170000	3174000	I pay attention to that feeling.
3174000	3180000	It's worse than what men have to deal with on their daily lives.
3180000	3185000	But you just, you don't even, you know, you don't even mention it unless it's kind of crippling you and making you in bed.
3185000	3190000	The fact that you're walking around means it's not even worth mentioning, even though it's terrible crippling agony.
3191000	3202000	I go home and I put on some tea and I read a book.
3202000	3209000	The book has all sorts of opinions on stuff that you should do or represent that don't even have anything to do with what you think you should do in life.
3211000	3213000	I turn on the television.
3213000	3214000	I feel like we peaked.
3214000	3215000	Have we peaked?
3215000	3216000	Sorry.
3216000	3218000	On the television, it's more of the same.
3219000	3226000	The media is rewarding men for doing things that hurt you and punishing you for doing things that demand your equal rights.
3227000	3228000	See, this is what I mean.
3228000	3231000	It's just the sad reality of life.
3233000	3239000	I try to do comedy about the situation because I think it'll be so funny that it'll make people, yeah.
3239000	3240000	Yeah.
3240000	3242000	Why aren't women funny?
3242000	3243000	This is terrible.
3243000	3244000	Who said that?
3244000	3246000	Everybody on Earth.
3247000	3251000	I try to prove them wrong by being really dirty and lateral.
3251000	3256000	You do amazing stuff and a couple alt comedians and people in the scene are like, yeah, she's getting really big.
3256000	3260000	But, you know, you've done everything that everyone, I don't know.
3260000	3262000	I just say a really funny joke.
3262000	3266000	I'd say a really funny joke that's like kind of fucking crazy because it's inappropriate.
3266000	3267000	Oh, it goes over well.
3267000	3270000	You get what's what's considered a polite chuckle.
3270000	3275000	And after the show, seven guys try and hit on you saying, you know, you're actually pretty funny.
3277000	3280000	Now, can I be president?
3280000	3281000	No.
3282000	3283000	All right.
3283000	3285000	Spencer Crittenden, world's best feminist.
3290000	3293000	Male, male feminists, world's best male feminists.
3293000	3296000	But to really answer your question, I really think you're talking about abuse.
3298000	3300000	Later that same night.
3301000	3303000	You're talking about the mental abuse earlier.
3303000	3304000	I think men have that problem.
3304000	3311000	They don't want to accept the fact that, you know, they've, you know, maybe abused women, you know, emotionally, even if it's unintentional or not.
3311000	3312000	They don't want to acknowledge it.
3312000	3313000	I think that's the biggest problem.
3313000	3315000	Oh, no, that's the most offensive thing.
3315000	3319000	Racially, I always repeat that joke that our late friend Mario from the drawing room said.
3319000	3321000	It's like you can call a white guy a honky.
3321000	3322000	You can call him a cracker.
3322000	3325000	But if you call him a racist, he gets really bent out of shape.
3326000	3328000	You can call a man anything you want.
3328000	3332000	But if you say that he's abusing women, they'll fucking choke you.
3332000	3333000	What?
3333000	3335000	But we do.
3335000	3338000	I think that, you know, we should probably.
3338000	3346000	All you have to do is just like put a little radar tag on your lapel and just be like, oh, how am I interacting with anybody, with people?
3346000	3347000	That's what my therapist is always saying.
3347000	3349000	She's like, you don't have to quit drinking.
3349000	3350000	She said that.
3352000	3354000	She said, just notice when you take a drink.
3354000	3355000	That's it.
3355000	3356000	That'll be the beginning of it.
3356000	3357000	Yeah, look in the cup.
3357000	3358000	See what's up.
3359000	3360000	Oh, vodka again.
3363000	3364000	Or vodka.
3365000	3366000	But yeah, I think.
3366000	3374000	But that's why that's why people that we often complain about, people that are outspoken and like we go like, oh, they get tweeted out.
3374000	3383000	So we had our friends from Reductress on the podcast and they talked about the women that stand out that they might be just comedically saying, hey, look, look at this phenomenon.
3383000	3385000	It's like saying, look at Joan of Arc.
3385000	3391000	It's like it's like there's more kindling there and there's drier weather and there's easier ways to start fires.
3391000	3400000	And it turns to witch burning way faster when someone is just saying, hey, be aware of this like it.
3400000	3403000	But like being aware of something doesn't mean someone wants your pants.
3403000	3405000	No one's going to take your pants.
3405000	3410000	Like if privilege is real and you admit that it's real, it means you have privilege.
3410000	3412000	It means no one can have your pants.
3413000	3416000	You can't pry on my pants from my cold heart.
3416000	3420000	Cold. You know what I meant.
3420000	3422000	Cold dead heart fingers.
3422000	3424000	Cold dead dick.
3425000	3430000	It took me a while to see things that way, too, because as I've said a thousand times, it's like, I get it.
3430000	3431000	You're a doughy white guy.
3431000	3432000	You've been born.
3432000	3433000	You come up through the system.
3433000	3435000	You endure what you perceive.
3435000	3436000	The system.
3436000	3437000	The system.
3437000	3438000	The mean streets.
3438000	3440000	You're out there in gen pop.
3443000	3444000	The system.
3444000	3445000	Okay.
3445000	3446000	Granted.
3447000	3448000	Just click your heels, Dorothy.
3448000	3450000	You've been in Oz the whole time.
3450000	3452000	What you perceive is the system.
3452000	3460000	And then when you start hearing talk about how you've had it easy, how are you supposed to react if you have an ounce of salt in your salt bladder?
3460000	3462000	I don't know how medicine works.
3462000	3463000	Salt bladder.
3464000	3466000	People feel really insecure.
3466000	3470000	Men feel really insecure really quick when that's even challenged, which I think is a weird thing.
3470000	3472000	And they don't even want to meditate on it at all.
3472000	3480000	I would argue the one thing that unites us all is that we all would have the same reaction if we were all told, shut up, stop complaining.
3480000	3481000	You've had it easy.
3481000	3486000	It's just that there's got to be somebody at the top that actually has had it easy.
3486000	3489000	Those people are going to hear that.
3489000	3491000	They're going to take that the wrong way.
3491000	3494000	It is the same reaction, though.
3494000	3497000	It is the thing that we say to each other.
3497000	3506000	When someone says, I work as a clicky clacker, and I don't get enough click clacks for my click clook.
3506000	3514000	You say the same thing to that person that if someone said it to you, you would fucking punch him in the face, which is like, fuck you.
3514000	3518000	You always dump that shit downhill.
3518000	3519000	You dump it down.
3519000	3525000	Every time there's a strike, every time someone sues a corporation because a jart killed their kid,
3525000	3527000	we always side with the corporation.
3527000	3530000	We have this human tendency to be like, fuck you, you whiny piece of shit.
3530000	3532000	You should fucking love capitalism.
3532000	3535000	Fucking rules.
3535000	3536000	What was my point?
3536000	3537000	I don't know.
3537000	3538000	Watch CISO.
3538000	3546000	I think your point was the guy that was burnt by hot coffee at McDonald's really deserved to win that lawsuit.
3546000	3547000	Yeah.
3547000	3549000	That coffee was too hot.
3549000	3550000	It was too hot.
3550000	3552000	People don't know, but it was too hot.
3552000	3553000	It wasn't a goddamn guy.
3553000	3555000	It was a fucking old lady.
3555000	3556000	Oh, I didn't know who it was.
3556000	3560000	I just remember Kramer trying it on a signed film.
3560000	3562000	I just saw that episode.
3562000	3563000	It's syndication.
3563000	3566000	They had like the Johnny Cochran, like analog guy.
3566000	3568000	Did you watch it on CISO?
3568000	3569000	Probably.
3569000	3571000	They have a lot of archived NBC comedy.
3571000	3575000	I mean, my community, because that's co-owned by Sony.
3575000	3577000	They got Saturday late nights next day.
3577000	3578000	Next day.
3578000	3579000	Next day.
3579000	3580000	Saturday night live.
3580000	3582000	That's Sunday morning, not live.
3582000	3586000	Man, when you subscribe to CISO, you're really subscribing to humanity.
3586000	3588000	Yeah.
3588000	3591000	I say if you CISO, say so.
3591000	3592000	Yeah.
3592000	3593000	I've been saying that for so long.
3593000	3594000	Yeah.
3594000	3595000	Everybody, just go out there.
3595000	3596000	Tell the world.
3596000	3597000	How much time do we have left?
3597000	3598000	Just yell it.
3598000	3599000	Probably.
3599000	3600000	Time for a rap.
3600000	3601000	I don't know.
3601000	3602000	23.
3602000	3603000	Yeah.
3603000	3604000	We got a bit of time.
3604000	3605000	Oh, my God.
3605000	3609000	The audience is asking us to stretch.
3609000	3611000	Calvin, are you a local?
3611000	3612000	You live in Austin?
3612000	3614000	No, I'm living in Florida right now.
3614000	3615000	All right.
3615000	3616000	Thanks.
3616000	3617000	Thanks for coming by.
3617000	3618000	You were a great guest.
3618000	3619000	No, I'm kidding.
3619000	3620000	You want to hang out the whole show?
3620000	3621000	Yeah, I'll hang out the whole show.
3621000	3622000	It's up to Dan.
3622000	3623000	It's not my decision.
3623000	3624000	No, no.
3624000	3625000	Calvin Stays.
3625000	3626000	It's like Martha Stewart's coming out.
3626000	3627000	Calvin, because that first guy...
3627000	3628000	What's his name?
3628000	3629000	Arthur?
3629000	3630000	What's his name?
3630000	3631000	The cowboy?
3631000	3632000	Black cowboy.
3632000	3633000	What the fuck?
3633000	3634000	I have right now.
3634000	3635000	Are you jealous of him right now, or is he going to be mad at you on the way in?
3635000	3636000	I think he might be mad at you.
3636000	3637000	Did Anthony leave?
3637000	3638000	The guy...
3638000	3641000	The black guy, the cowboy had his cameo and then left?
3641000	3642000	Yeah.
3642000	3643000	He did the mic drop and left.
3643000	3646000	I was going to ask him if he knew who he is.
3646000	3650000	His girlfriend left before he came on stage.
3650000	3651000	She left.
3651000	3652000	She left.
3652000	3656000	She was like, I'm not having no date that's better than me.
3656000	3657000	No.
3657000	3660000	She found out that he's a piece of shit.
3660000	3663000	He lied about saying get out.
3663000	3664000	Oh, yeah.
3664000	3665000	People don't like that.
3665000	3667000	He didn't just jump up and say, I saw it.
3667000	3668000	Get out.
3668000	3669000	He like...
3669000	3672000	We started talking about get out and he went, woo!
3672000	3676000	And then he like, chook it, chook it up onto the stage and like, he took advantage of a
3676000	3678000	market that was there.
3678000	3679000	He wasn't...
3679000	3680000	Capitalism.
3680000	3681000	No, no.
3681000	3684000	He took advantage of the bullshit market.
3684000	3692000	And the question is, had he been white or a woman, would he have made it this far before
3692000	3693000	the stun guns came out?
3693000	3694000	No.
3694000	3697000	If he was a woman, I would have pushed her back.
3697000	3701000	I would have grabbed her by both shoulders and sent her sailing.
3701000	3702000	Yeah.
3702000	3706000	If you're thinking about it now, ladies.
3706000	3707000	Just try me.
3707000	3710000	I mean, who doesn't want to be sailing?
3710000	3712000	That sounds delightful.
3712000	3713000	Right.
3713000	3718000	It sounds like I'm Christopher Cross and a very romantic thing is about to happen.
3718000	3723000	Will you make an agreement that if a woman does charge the stage that you will send her
3723000	3728000	you will go with her on a night cruise down the Texas River, whatever the fuck we're at.
3728000	3731000	No, I won't commit to that, Jeff.
3731000	3734000	Jeff, there are paces there.
3734000	3739000	I was standing at my fucking hotel at the Radisson on the fucking river while people
3739000	3744000	crowded to watch the bats come out and waited till sunset and there was a thousand people
3744000	3745000	out there.
3745000	3748000	An hour went by waiting for the sun to go down.
3748000	3752000	And as I waited an hour to watch the bats, I realized when the bats come out, it'll be
3752000	3755000	dark out and I won't see shit.
3755000	3757000	So I fucking left.
3757000	3759000	You didn't even see it?
3759000	3760000	No.
3760000	3761000	I've never waited for it.
3761000	3762000	I was in a hotel room.
3762000	3765000	The Hyatt looks in the right direction.
3765000	3768000	And I got tired of waiting for the fucking bats to come out.
3768000	3769000	Me too.
3769000	3770000	I couldn't take it.
3770000	3774000	Well, now that everyone knows we're at the Radisson, can I just promote them for the
3774000	3782000	fact that they have, their rooms are the fucking best in terms of AC outlet placement.
3782000	3788000	When you stay at the downtown Radisson in Austin, you are never more than eight inches
3788000	3791000	from a fucking AC outlet and a USB port.
3791000	3792000	It is incredible.
3792000	3795000	This is important to my listeners.
3795000	3802000	The shower has been turned into a giant extension cord so that you can learn door fortress.
3803000	3807000	But please put toothpaste in the rooms.
3807000	3809000	Let's all put toothpaste in the hotel room.
3809000	3811000	That's a rarer thing.
3811000	3814000	Did you just see that somewhere and think it should be everywhere?
3814000	3815000	No.
3815000	3817000	Maybe I saw it somewhere in Paris or something.
3817000	3819000	I'm not happy with my Radisson experience.
3819000	3820000	Oh, shit.
3820000	3821000	Oh, shit.
3821000	3822000	I fucking left all day long.
3822000	3823000	They didn't clean my room.
3823000	3825000	There was no water back in the room.
3825000	3829000	They asked for water and they came up and they knocked on the door and they just said
3829000	3831000	housekeeping and they didn't have any fucking water.
3831000	3832000	Oh, okay.
3832000	3836000	But they did have a thing because same thing.
3836000	3841000	But they didn't knock on the door every 10 minutes going housekeeping like in that voice.
3841000	3845000	Oh, are we having a Radisson debate?
3845000	3850000	I think there was some literature or something that said like if you'd like your house thing
3850000	3852000	to be put in order, you can put a thing out.
3852000	3853000	I don't know.
3853000	3854000	It's a Radisson.
3854000	3855000	Who gives a shit?
3855000	3857000	Did they have mustard?
3857000	3859000	No, they didn't have mustard.
3859000	3864000	But I looked up into the corner of my room where there should only be spiders.
3864000	3867000	There was an AC outlet up in the corner.
3867000	3870000	There was an AC outlet up in the corner.
3870000	3872000	I just love AC outlets.
3872000	3873000	You know what can go fuck itself?
3873000	3874000	It's Holiday Inn Express.
3874000	3877000	I stayed at one in some weird part of the country.
3877000	3881000	I think it was called like Indiana, Pennsylvania.
3881000	3884000	And if I'm wrong, I'm close.
3884000	3886000	It was confusing.
3886000	3889000	My room had no windows, no closet.
3889000	3894000	And if you turned anything on, the TV went off.
3894000	3896000	You took a shower and water came out of the TV.
3896000	3898000	It's like a Marx Brothers bit.
3898000	3901000	And not now, Power Hog.
3901000	3906000	And the sign above it in awesome Holiday Inn font said, relax.
3906000	3908000	It's Holiday Inn.
3908000	3911000	Which could be written a couple of ways.
3911000	3912000	Relax.
3912000	3913000	It's Holiday Inn.
3913000	3915000	What did you think was going to fucking happen?
3915000	3919000	These should go one step further and be settled down.
3919000	3922000	Simmer down.
3922000	3924000	Don't be too big for your boots.
3924000	3928000	In a world where there's a lot of fish to fry,
3928000	3934000	the Radisson downtown Austin has more AC outlets than you can shake a stick at.
3934000	3937000	And I ordered room service and I ordered a cheeseburger.
3937000	3940000	And the woman that answered the phone and said, room service,
3940000	3941000	I said, I'd like a cheeseburger.
3941000	3942000	She said, go on.
3942000	3944000	I said, I'd like a Stella Artois.
3944000	3947000	And she said, excellent choice.
3947000	3948000	Wow.
3948000	3949000	And then she said, I'll be right up.
3949000	3951000	And I was like, I'll be right up.
3951000	3952000	Weird pronoun.
3952000	3953000	This is a system.
3953000	3954000	This is Brazil.
3954000	3955000	You're supposed to what?
3955000	3956000	Knock on the door.
3956000	3957000	She comes in.
3957000	3959000	Cindy comes in, learned her name.
3959000	3960000	Because guess what?
3960000	3961000	Figured out who she was.
3961000	3969000	Because as she opened my Stella, she went, oh, that looks good.
3969000	3970000	Yeah, it's dark.
3970000	3971000	It's dark.
3971000	3972000	Cindy's an alcoholic.
3972000	3975000	But I was like, did you take my order?
3975000	3979000	Did she say, hello, my name is Cindy and I'm an alcoholic?
3979000	3981000	I said, she opened it.
3981000	3983000	She said, here's your Stella Artois.
3983000	3985000	She did like a French accent.
3985000	3986000	And she opened it.
3986000	3987000	She's like, oh, that looked good.
3987000	3989000	And I thought, hmm.
3989000	3992000	And I was like, were you the one that took the order?
3992000	3993000	And she said, yes.
3993000	3996000	And I said, you know, I really appreciated you excellent-choicing me.
3996000	3998000	Like, you told me it was an excellent choice.
3998000	3999000	She's like, it is an excellent choice.
3999000	4002000	It's like, do you want my Stella?
4002000	4003000	Have a drink.
4003000	4004000	Do you want to take a sip of it?
4004000	4006000	And she said, oh, I can't go there.
4006000	4011000	And it was like, oh, dark, darkness, darkness.
4011000	4012000	That's a fine line.
4012000	4014000	But I think she's going to be fine.
4014000	4016000	So she ate all of your food.
4016000	4017000	And then she left.
4017000	4020000	She's going to be fine because she made it this far and her weakness is Stella Artois.
4020000	4023000	Like, it's not like, you know, she wasn't like, antifreeze.
4023000	4025000	No, no, no, no, no.
4025000	4028000	All right, so we only have a few minutes left.
4028000	4029000	Oh, shit.
4029000	4031000	Shall we finish this off with a Doug Benson rap?
4031000	4032000	What?
4032000	4033000	Yeah.
4033000	4034000	Yeah.
4034000	4035000	What does that mean?
4035000	4036000	Let's do it.
4036000	4037000	Yo.
4037000	4038000	Whatever you want it to be.
4038000	4039000	Doug Benson rap.
4039000	4040000	Oh, shit.
4040000	4041000	Yo.
4041000	4042000	All right.
4042000	4043000	Yeah.
4043000	4044000	Oh, Calvin on the beatbox, all right.
4044000	4046000	Doug Benson rap.
4046000	4049000	He's going to rap, tell you crap.
4049000	4054000	When Doug Benson raps, you're going to tell all your friends you heard of Doug Benson rap.
4054000	4060000	The first two minutes of a Doug Benson rap is a Dan Harmon rap.
4060000	4062000	It's an introductory rap.
4062000	4067000	But if I can rap about this lap, it's a victory lap where I go around.
4067000	4069000	I'm going to Christmas rap his rap.
4069000	4072000	I'm going to rap it up and give it to you as a gift.
4072000	4074000	Doug Benson's who I'm here to lift.
4074000	4076000	I'm going to lift him to stardom.
4076000	4077000	Lift him up.
4077000	4079000	I'm going to lift Doug Benson like a girl.
4079000	4080000	Yo, Calvin.
4080000	4083000	Talk about a Doug Benson rap, Calvin.
4083000	4085000	Doug, Doug Benson rap.
4085000	4086000	Why is he rapping?
4086000	4087000	He's not even clapping.
4087000	4089000	Do you have the clap?
4089000	4090000	What is the clap?
4090000	4091000	Why am I rapping?
4091000	4092000	Jeff, why'd you do this?
4092000	4095000	There's two guys right next to me who could do it better.
4095000	4096000	That didn't rhyme.
4096000	4100000	This is a good example of why you shouldn't have said my name.
4100000	4102000	But it's cool.
4102000	4103000	It doesn't matter.
4103000	4106000	I'm still the only black guys on stage rapping.
4106000	4107000	Yo.
4110000	4112000	It's Calvin Doug Benson rap.
4112000	4116000	He said white guys could rap better.
4116000	4120000	And he's also the only one not in a sweater.
4120000	4121000	Oh.
4121000	4123000	My spaghetti.
4123000	4124000	It's warm out.
4124000	4125000	You know it.
4125000	4129000	You dressed up to show it.
4129000	4130000	Okay.
4130000	4131000	Well, you proved him wrong.
4131000	4133000	You proved him wrong.
4133000	4135000	This is called the Doug Benson rap.
4135000	4136000	I know.
4136000	4138000	I tried.
4138000	4140000	When I said I could do it, I lied.
4141000	4142000	Yeah.
4143000	4144000	Let yourself go.
4144000	4145000	Let it go.
4145000	4146000	Let it all out.
4146000	4148000	Oh, let's be frozen.
4150000	4155000	Because Dan is the chosen one for our entertainment.
4155000	4157000	That's all I got.
4159000	4160000	Yo, left to right.
4160000	4163000	I'm going to fuck your mama like ketchup fucks mustard tonight.
4163000	4165000	I'm going to take it to the break.
4165000	4168000	Don, I'm going to I'm going to write this with nothing but the front lawn.
4168000	4171000	I'm going to fuck her.
4171000	4172000	Dejaun.
4172000	4173000	Dejaun.
4173000	4175000	A lot of Monday morning quarterback.
4175000	4176000	All right.
4176000	4178000	Try and take the beat and then give it a spin.
4178000	4179000	Yeah.
4179000	4180000	I feel really insecure.
4180000	4181000	I shouldn't have took your rap.
4181000	4183000	I'm going to step kind of back and let you do the same.
4183000	4184000	You know what?
4184000	4186000	You just did you.
4186000	4189000	Thank you for coming to Harvard Chat, everybody.
4189000	4191000	He pooped on his rap.
4191000	4192000	Let's hear it.
4192000	4194000	Let's hear it for Doug Benson, everybody.
4194000	4196000	Yeah, thank you.
4197000	4199000	Calvin.
4201000	4203000	Spencer Crittenden.
4204000	4205000	I'm Jeff Davis.
4205000	4206000	Your count totally.
4206000	4207000	Your mayor is Dan Harmon.
4207000	4209000	Thank you so much.
4210000	4212000	Thank you South by Southwest.

4227000	4229000	Did you get any of that?
4230000	4232000	It's a good show.
4235000	4237000	Sarah Audio.
