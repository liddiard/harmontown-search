27280	28280	Thank you.
28280	29280	Thank you.
29280	36680	You, um, let's just have a sleepy show.
36680	61400	It's been a long weekend, it was Comic Con weekend, how many of you were in San Diego
61400	64400	this weekend?
64400	70520	It was a long haul and a very enjoyable one, we've got, we learned a lot.
70520	72880	You had a busy docket too, you were all over the shop.
72880	73880	Yup.
73880	74880	Um.
74880	78840	Did you get some business done, did you make some deals?
78840	82840	Yeah, yeah man, I'm good man.
82840	90480	Uh, let's just try to figure out what business to get out of the way.
90480	99520	We have a guest tonight, we're going to chat with her, um, Ryan Ridley's also going to
99520	104160	join us in a bit, yup, the Riddler.
104160	111920	Uh, you know, the only things that are going on are, look, did you see the, I didn't talk
111920	118400	about this last night, did I, or Friday, the Trump ad that he just, is it his own people
118400	124920	that made that, the one that has the statistics, where it's like 46 minutes of speech, 22 minutes
124920	134080	of applause, it was like, it was like stats about how great his speech went, like it was
134080	139000	so weird that he's like a 16 year old girl going, going, going like, like, like three
139000	146680	pounds of birthday cake, like three candles per square inch of frosting.
146680	152720	It's your birthday, you dumb fuck, it's what happens, no one has to love you in order for
152720	157440	that to happen, you had the fucking Republican convention talking about being president,
157440	163080	the only alternative is a Democrat, they were there to cheer, you dipshit, that doesn't
163080	167000	mean you did something right.
167000	171680	I think you come down on Trump a little too hard sometimes.
171680	176000	Let the man have a chance, let him talk, let him talk.
177000	182560	He took the Washington Post's press credentials away or something, like, you can't follow
182560	188480	me around anymore because you always say mean things, but that's the newspaper that, yeah,
188480	194240	they're like totally anti-Trump and every headline is like he's a piece of shit and here's why,
194240	199600	but he is a piece of shit and then also because he complained about it, they said, well why
199600	204320	don't you come in, because he kept talking about how they edit the articles or they misrepresent
204320	209280	things, so they brought him in and just sat him down and they published the entire transcript
209280	215520	and he's, guess what, he's a fucking dumbass, like it was like a three hour transcript of
215520	221120	them just going like, what do you think of Nixon, Nixon was great, Nixon was good, he
221120	226880	made some mistakes, but Nixon was a president, he was a huge president, okay what about Abe
226880	232000	Lincoln, Abe Lincoln, Abe Lincoln seems, you know, great, great president, truly great president.
236160	241920	All right, but you guys can hear all about that. He's gonna win, I got a fucking feeling,
241920	250080	he's gonna win, I'm not a pessimist, I don't want him to, I just feel like we didn't think
250080	254960	he was gonna get this far and he's gonna ride that wave all the way into the beach,
254960	262160	which is us all dying. Or will he ride a Russian conspiracy to get him elected into the beach?
262160	267840	Yeah, what's the deal with that man? What the fuck are you talking about? We hear that the Russians
267840	274000	are the hackers that leaked all this DNC shit, it's pretty crazy man, and WikiLeaks loves
274000	280800	Milo Yiannopoulos all of a sudden, some crazy world shit man. So there's this gay guy, he's like a
280800	284320	Republican gay guy. I'm gonna stop you right there, I'm gonna stop you there.
286640	292720	He's like a pro-Trump guy, so the campuses are turning like, you know, like there's little
292720	301360	Trump heads on the campuses, because how else are you gonna rebel now? They just want to worry
301360	309040	people, you know, that's their job, they're young, and then they're really fond of this guy, I mean
309040	313520	this is them cracking the code, or rather the code is cracking them because, you know, they love
313520	324880	a gay guy, like we win, in certain respect, that's all we wanted. Like they can see that this guy
324880	328960	is gay and also a human being that they love, but they love him because he says all kinds of fucked
328960	337280	up shit, and if you complain back then you're homophobic. So it's pretty, it's kind of fun,
337600	344720	like we're all six years old, it's like, it's easy to follow politics now, because it's like,
344720	353920	it's like, Tabitha hit someone with a toy truck, like it's not that hard, like you used to have
353920	360080	to know what a majority whip was, I couldn't get through one episode of House of Cards, I'm like,
360080	365200	I don't know what the fuck a whip is, stop telling me about the whip, how can a show where the guy
365200	375760	talks to the camera be this confusing? Dan Harmon, really? That was me, I was the worst Kevin Spacey
375760	382560	along the way. I just started watching that, it's a good show. Well Jeff, I'm glad you like that show,
383680	385920	I'm not glad Jeff likes that show.
385920	397280	Oh, but if I tell him I am, well in about two terms he'll flip like a labradoodle at an Othello party.
400880	405440	Oh Dan Harmon, I'm about to do the Harmon on Dan.
408720	412480	All right, well let's just, let's bring out our new friend, I mean really she should be an old
412480	416800	friend, I'm sure she is to many of you, she played maybe on Arrested Development, she's
419200	426720	the rest of her resume is like, she clearly, she's probably someone hip enough to not mind
426720	432480	being called hip, she's definitely a presence in the hip pocket of comedy. She's deputy chief of
432480	440480	staff on Trump's campaign. But I just ran into her at the up fronts, the Turner cable up fronts,
440480	443840	so let's make friends with her. Alia Shawkat is here.
459760	463760	I just had this crazy panic right as I was introducing you because I thought,
463760	470080	wait have I only seen her name in print? Have I ever said it out loud in front of her?
470640	471120	In my eyes.
472640	473760	Alia Shawkat.
473760	475600	That's pretty close, I say Alia.
475600	476080	Alia.
476720	477280	You can say Alia.
478720	480480	That's the first time I went Alia.
480480	483440	Yeah it's okay, there is a panic struck with a lot of people.
483440	488000	Yeah, Alia is this a Boa thing you have going on or is this part of the top?
488000	489200	No it's detachable.
490960	493280	I'm hip, I'm really hip.
495280	497840	Yeah you know it's hot, but sometimes you get a little colder on the neck.
498320	503680	I'm going to make myself a straight up vodka drink if that's okay.
503680	509920	Yeah you're not getting any flack from the Elmo fur industry people are you?
509920	511120	No me and Elmo had a thing.
512640	513840	Is that what color Elmo is?
514480	518240	She's wearing a fur thing for those of you listening in audio.
518240	520800	All right some of these people don't understand. I'm wearing Elmo around my neck.
521280	529280	All right so let's talk about when I was at Turner you were.
529280	531360	What a weird thing that was by the way right?
531360	537040	Yeah well what's really weird is how funny Conan O'Brien Anderson Cooper and Charles Barkley are
537040	540720	as a three-man comedy team.
541600	547840	They really tore the place up and it was great because Conan O'Brien and Charles Barkley started
547840	552080	doing these basketball jokes about you know well I'm taller than you.
552080	554480	Barkley was just shooting stuff off the hip no pun intended.
554480	557920	I mean he was just like he's funny he's actually he was really straight up funny.
557920	562800	But then right on schedule Anderson Cooper right as I was thinking like like the same thing except
562800	568640	because I'm a nerd like Anderson Cooper said guys I'm gay I've been like yeah like my eyes glazed
568640	573920	over five sports jokes ago and it was really I did a great job of retelling his joke.
573920	577040	Yeah well you're not gay so it's a little different effect.
577520	582880	No it was such a strange thing that they had a drone on a leash.
582880	583520	Yeah.
583520	590000	That was like hovering like trying to get away and Wolf Blitzer was just kind of staring at it like
590000	594960	what's happening and it was so odd and I was sitting in the front row and I felt like this
594960	600320	weird prom queen to an event I had no attachment to because it's like they it's mainly for promoters
600320	604640	right so like I mean not promoters advertisement so it's like people from all over the country
604640	610480	selling stuff for these networks and they're like pushing Turner you know so they're like
610480	615600	we make you know 18 to 24 and like all these percentages and these like weird PowerPoint
615600	617600	presentations and fireworks.
617600	621120	Yeah I took a picture of one thing it was like Wolf Blitzer standing in front of a big screen
621120	629520	that said like your your brand plus Turner's reach equals a winner because it was yeah it was
629600	635680	like a it was like a it was like we're announcing the election results now because that was the
635680	641200	creepy part did you feel creeped out by the fact that they were selling they kept insisting that
641200	646720	this election was going to be a squeaker the same way the NFL would assure you that the Super Bowl
646720	650800	is going to be is going to be packed there's going to be people are going to be glued to their sets
650800	655920	and it's like oh I'm so uncomfortable with that you're already state-run television like you're
655920	660320	already just this one tube that people get all their state of our country that we're talking
660320	664640	about it's like crazy obviously it's going to have higher ratings but to be like you better
664640	669200	watch our country fall apart it's going to be crazy like stay tuned we have to make it that way
670320	678000	because they can they can definitely put their thumb on the scale especially if like the whole
678000	682400	point is for no thumb to be on there like a thumb weighs a lot in journalism yeah exactly
682480	686080	like Al Jazeera is probably like I don't know just watch because it's the world
686080	689360	you know what I mean like stay tuned because that's what's happening and they're like no
689360	696000	we're gonna make this fun yeah it's very very disturbing all the news organizations just keep
696000	700960	boasting about their ratings during these debates and things like that it's just like that's it
700960	706800	really is depressing yeah I yeah I you know they definitely didn't they they there was some 9 11
706800	711760	footage uh like like because it was like like we're always there CNN's always there
712560	716400	it was like friends you know what I mean they're like remember France huge hit 9 11 also a big hit
718480	724720	two big hits well three two and a half big hits I think one of those hits wasn't really a hit at
724720	733760	all yeah oh are you one of those people yeah I think one of those hits was uh was planted
733760	741520	detonators on the uh I beams of those there's no black box out um what about building seven how
741520	747520	come okay it was funny too that sorry we can't move up but that they said something about um
747520	753040	they're doing another apprentice season and Donald Trump was his producing it and I was
753040	758000	like is this whole thing just to like yes get yeah just to get more people to watch the apprentice
758000	762000	of course it is yeah he's like remember I almost became president he's already won if he doesn't
762080	766640	win the presidency he's already won he's the most famous person in the world right now he might be
766640	771040	the most famous person of all time like like you can't go anywhere in the world where he's not a
771040	775600	punch line or a setup or a thing like it's a serious imagine it's like men in black like
775600	780560	underneath it it's like and there's just like this tiny little like dying alien who's like
780560	786080	actually running the body that was the worst thing was that we we at comic-con are the co-creator of
786080	789760	Rick and Marty Justin Royland and his friends Alex Hirsch and I can never remember the third
789840	794800	guy's name because it's like I don't want to get it wrong um so so he's the guy you work with um
797680	802240	they had a party on this yacht and like they they just they just fuck it why not invite everyone
802240	808480	from Game of Thrones and like every fucker showed up like every single goddamn throne ever in the game
809360	814560	like like they were just yeah I didn't know that was gonna happen this party was on a
815040	821520	old like 1929 yacht like a three deck old like Rockefeller's yacht kind of looking thing
821520	826800	from the old days and you know it's our nerd comedy and animator friends hanging out and I
826800	832320	round the bend and I see a guy that I recognize I go oh my god I just put my hand out and he goes
832320	837760	hi and it's Sam well right the chubby guy from Game of Thrones that likes books and you know
837760	842880	protects the baby and kills the white walker with the thing and I go oh I don't know his name I like
842880	848960	oh my god I love you on the show he goes thank you that's really nice and they turn the corner
849600	855760	I go to the bar Ramsey Bolton that was the that was the most freaked out one of your
855760	861040	game of thrones person no I'm not you're you're like an incredible sport you're like that's
861040	867680	pretty great you're like you're like crazy that guy I mean aren't there like 32 cast members on
868240	873280	yeah yeah and they on all their names are like yeah yeah I mean you've been you've been you know
873280	878800	like they're not they're no one's like mike steel dick like like like so that you can just remember
878800	884800	it's like dinklage and that's it like everybody else is like yerman sherman germs actually that
884800	890320	would be easy to remember yerman sherman germs but but I was gonna say the tough thing was because
890320	896560	you know they're fancy they're from an HBO show they're from the most watched thing ever they're
896560	902640	like nerd royalty there and and like it was just sad like because all I wanted to ask was what's it
902640	909040	like to be so fucking crazy famous right now they and which is an answer they they can either their
909040	912720	answer is going to be the weirdest the most distorted humble and they're going to be the
912720	916800	most sick of answering that question so it's like pointless to ask that but it's really all I can
916800	921280	think of to act so like I don't I can't what would you want them to be like you know what dude
921280	926720	it's fucking crazy it's a mind it's a mind blower yeah I don't know my life has changed forever
926720	930160	yeah and it's like but what would that even mean yeah I'd go like okay so yeah I don't know why
930160	934240	so I don't know why I do that but I think it's just good when when I'm like really into somebody
934240	938720	like I'm a fan of someone instead of like trying to interact with them so they actually know who I
938720	943520	am I just like to like get stoned with them or something like or you know get like in an
943520	949360	environment where we get a little drunk or something great good uh I'm glad we're adults
949440	955040	um but it just like kind of like change reality where it's like oh this person that I'm used to
955040	959840	seeing talk I get to see in this like alternate like I don't know that's the only best takeaway
959840	964080	I can get from it because anytime I try to like connect with someone I'm a fan of never works
964080	967920	well there's all that pressure it's like it's like oh how can I fuck this up which is something you
967920	972640	should never be thinking when you're talking to someone ever because that's like that's something
972640	975920	that yeah imagine you did that when you ordered coffee you're like I really hope I don't I hope
975920	982560	this person likes me yeah the didn't wait today okay well I just want to finish my my one thought
982560	986880	because so you don't think that I have to do these weird segues I I because I would hate for you to
986880	992560	think that it's already happening yeah uh I this thing runs like a swiss that's why they call them
992560	999760	Dan stay on target harmon uh but I just started to connect those dots so the bummer was that in
999760	1005280	the midst of all of that humility and and fan boyishness that I was feeling like the only other
1005280	1010560	thing for them to talk about was like so like Trump you know and it's like oh I don't want to
1010560	1014800	I don't want I don't want Sir Davos like to have no having to worry about that shit
1017280	1022720	but it is something for him to worry about he's got to worry about his fingers he's got to worry
1022720	1028960	about all sorts he had ten fingers and yeah in the show does he have like all this guy or something
1028960	1033520	the crazy thing was they just finished shooting so they all have the same haircut like they all
1034240	1038640	in the modern clothes yeah they're wearing his jay crew shirts but it's like it's like a little
1038640	1044560	bit of products you know but but except for there's you probably the show is ubiquitous enough that
1044560	1050720	you are you familiar with the image of uh varus the bald eunuch like he's kind of portly like
1050720	1056160	and I feel like I am now he wears like a big robe I don't know it's just maybe maybe even in memes
1056160	1062080	you would have encountered this image of this guy like he's the he's the master master of gossip
1062080	1068720	and to sabotage and subterfuge and uh relies on apparently a network of underage children to
1068720	1074640	I don't know wow this show goes deep and he can teleport sometimes but
1077360	1081440	yeah that you guys I'll be right back and he's on he's he's across the entire planet
1082400	1090160	but anyways he was he's just suffice it to say the guy is he's like he's he's he he has three
1090160	1095440	things about him that that make him recognizable and he was the one guy because he had it was tan
1095440	1099520	varus with like a full head of hair yeah so he wasn't getting fucked with it all he didn't have
1099520	1105680	to answer any of my dumb ass questions he probably was sad about that too yeah he's he's he's got it
1105680	1109760	made man like that's what you want you gotta you want to play a character that like has an eye
1109760	1115360	patch or something so that you can detach yourself totally have you what you were you were super
1115360	1120640	young when you weren't arrested right yeah I mean I was 14 and I did the pilot how how what
1120640	1130160	was your act I know it's mean hubba hubba you you grew up in palm springs I just researched
1130160	1137920	uh like so so where you were you got so many cheers for that Sherman's deli whoo yeah that's
1137920	1144080	all I have and your dad was an actor so no my so my grandfather was an actor all right Wikipedia

1203920	1207760	seventh veil was the first one because he was trying to still convince himself he's like
1207760	1213920	he's like it's classy and it's cultural i don't think they're worried about that but um and my
1213920	1220800	mom was like a law school dropout and so she got a job as a waitress at uh the body shop and they
1220800	1227360	met and uh fell in love wow and then decided to open up their own business in palm springs
1227360	1230640	because my grandfather heard that the actor had a weekend home in palm springs he retired and
1230640	1235360	because all the actors in the 60s did and um so then they moved there and opened up their own
1235360	1240960	strip club and uh this is so romantic as long as they're still together they are still together
1240960	1247840	and the strip club's still going and uh that's called showgirls it's a cathedral city i want to
1247920	1251360	i have to imagine there was some sort of mafia connection like not not you're not your family
1251360	1255520	but like if you're going to open a strip club in palm springs the mob is involved right i mean my
1255520	1260640	my dad's family always seemed like the mob you know what i mean like there was just like you
1260640	1267360	know a lot of them uh they're arabic they have like gold chains one of the definitions of mob
1267360	1271760	yeah they're like you know they're gamblers like we went to vegas like every weekend a lot of my
1271760	1277200	childhood so it was very like anything you need you know it was like very it had the same persona
1277200	1280800	but uh i don't think they were like killing people like sometimes it would like you know one
1280800	1285760	of the clubs would burn down like that kind of thing yeah but that's what i'm talking about
1285760	1290800	but my dad is very like this the straightest arrow of the bunch like he's very conservative
1290800	1294560	and you know so in palm springs he's like this one will be running like a tight ship
1295840	1297760	no more burning no more burning
1297760	1309360	um i we have a friend chris romano who this is all public record right like yeah he said
1309360	1314160	he said it on tv he's he's he's told the story on the podcast but like he his name is chris
1314160	1318800	romano he couldn't be more italian he's this little like like like a little sounds like a
1318800	1325520	horrible debate he's shorter he's short but he's like so italian and so like charming and like
1325600	1330640	like like like and he was always it's just like they're from him his partner eric falgner from
1330640	1337840	boston so he's got this boston accent he's just like chris romano ladies can't resist me and uh
1339280	1345760	also he to know him for 15 minutes you've seen his dick twice yeah that guy's dick is out he's
1345760	1352160	very open he's yeah he's like he's you know he kind of like he he he he he he lowers the bar of
1353120	1358640	of go to channel 101.com and watch shit buster you'll know everything you need to know so he
1358640	1365680	finds out in his in his adulthood like way into being a whole human being um he finds out that
1366240	1374320	he uh romano was this like you know quickly chosen witness protection program name that
1374320	1381760	his i think his dad picked so and he was a lebanese arsonist oh my god so this like quintessential
1381760	1386800	like like boston italian kid like like he's lebanese all of a sudden you're like oh you're
1386800	1391920	like i'm gonna harp well he was doing a drunk history and he was going to talk about the red
1391920	1396160	socks winning the world series something like that and he got so drunk well he wasn't drunk enough
1396160	1399920	so Derek Derek Waters kept getting him drunker and drunker and drunker and finally he couldn't
1399920	1406480	get past uh game one he couldn't like get to the game two and he just he lost all train of thought
1406480	1410880	and he goes oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry you know my dad was like the most the most famous
1410880	1419360	arsonist in massachusetts and like and he's in the witness they were in the witness relocation
1419360	1426960	program and i run into uh into chris romano in a in the baby toy section at a toys r us don't ask
1426960	1433920	why i was there oh he he has a baby i was just there being a a competitor apparently uh but he
1433920	1437760	told us he said i got so drunk i told the story he was like a lot of the people i talk about are
1437760	1443120	still alive they're in jail like it's like yeah look because his dad would that's that's those are
1443120	1451760	the dots i was connecting mob uh uh middle eastern and uh uh the arson business uh my dad'll be so
1451760	1457520	happy uh because i guess he was just a guy you hired it was like a firebug you know you just
1457520	1461920	like you for insurance you just there's a guy that you actually get that specializes in setting
1461920	1472400	the fires like an Arab really out it was a movie guys and he burned building so um you the reason
1472400	1476720	we ran into each other at that weird up front was because you were you were you're in something
1476720	1483840	that's rolling out are you only acting in that um i'm producing it okay and it's what's it called
1483840	1488880	uh search party okay just search by not uh search right is it is it airing yet no it comes out in
1488880	1493440	November okay on TBS and it's but they dropped the very funny so it's just TBS
1496560	1501760	my first found out i was like TBS very funny yeah like we're not doing that anymore all right
1501760	1506400	the only the only bad thing about the history channel was that right before i started doing
1506400	1512880	a show on it they had decided that they were rebranding as the just the word history interesting
1512880	1518080	so no more channel but how so then you have to but you have to catch yourself i mean i yeah i'm
1518080	1523760	on the history ask any of these guys i made it through the transgender revolution without without
1523760	1531520	without it i wove through those cones like a fucking greased shark but but but like a greased
1531520	1539040	shark going through cones but this but if that doesn't conjure up a lack pretty attached to the
1539040	1545520	sea floor they weren't floating however having the the history thing really through me i mean
1545600	1550560	i was just like the the the it's the history channel and so every time you want to make a joke
1550560	1555040	within the show like oh the history channel people are here you can't that somebody goes
1555040	1559520	like so they corrected like no no i mean they're they're they're they're the most laissez-faire like
1559520	1564800	like like chilled uh non-channel in the world uh in history
1568320	1572960	but but it would just come through it just kind of it was an edict that was that trickled down to
1572960	1576800	mindset so there was just always somebody that was like it was usually levy it's like like you
1576800	1584080	got to say history instead of history channel right fucking dick he's crying uh oh no he's laughing
1584080	1591200	oh that's good but uh yeah i mean i could well whatever okay yeah no it's a new show i so it's a
1591200	1598240	show it's good it's your show your show the show is uh it it's it's the it's it's a group of friends
1598240	1602720	who are kind of reuniting in the wake of one of their friends disappearances right yeah
1603040	1609040	they're like friends uh they're kind of like not the best people my character's kind of a wallflower
1609040	1614400	just kind of like she doesn't know what she wants uh millennial sort and then a girl from college
1614400	1618400	she went to school with it she didn't know well at all it goes missing and my character becomes
1618400	1622000	obsessed with trying to find her so it's like she's not the right person for the job but she
1622000	1629200	becomes obsessed with it so i describe it as like a hipster columbo kind of yeah yeah i mean that's
1629200	1634480	got my number yeah there you go john early's in it really funny is this based on anything in
1634480	1641040	reality or is that just no i mean the creators of the show um sarah violet bliss and and charles
1641040	1648240	rogers like have weird mysteries in their family um but that's all i'll tell you but um so they
1648240	1653120	kind of like were inspired by that like having a mystery and like if something happened like
1653120	1656960	someone went missing in our lives right now like what would we do like what are the tools we
1656960	1662000	actually have to find somebody but um but it's not really based on anything but now whether it's
1662000	1667040	because i did the show or not i noticed so many missing poster things i got for before the show i
1667040	1670960	was like people don't go missing anymore i mean they do i guess but i just like wasn't aware of
1670960	1674720	it but then now there's like there's so many posters where people are like you know college
1674720	1681200	just like yeah i've been kind of collecting them in a weird way to validate my career i think but um
1681200	1685440	you just never saw you're now seeing them you're just noticing them everywhere and then that's
1685440	1691680	like the pilot starts it's a lot of me doing this like just like staring off uh into the distance
1691680	1697280	like looking confused that's like 90 percent of the show so this is a pilot you shot or it's
1697280	1701280	been picked up for series we shot a whole first season oh yeah congratulations thank you
1702640	1707760	and we assume if it's a you know it's if it's if it's a ratings bonanza then at the end of it
1707760	1712640	you'll have the extra scene that you shot where where she goes like you know what i love solving
1712640	1719040	mr yeah exactly and then i'm like if you love solving them too press a and then it's an
1719040	1724720	interactive show do you think do you think is it something you do continue to do yeah i mean i
1724720	1729600	always have like a little not to be like oh i'm scared of tv but tv shows go on for like so
1729600	1734000	fucking long it's kind of insane so like i'm not going to be like i'd love to do it for the next
1734000	1739360	decade of my life but uh i definitely like to do like yeah three yeah seasons i don't know yeah
1739360	1743840	you know i want to do it again i mean this is just the old curmudgeon in me i'm just like shaking
1743840	1747440	my cane at you and going like oh you'll get a taste of ones that don't last very long
1751040	1755280	i feel like two shows that were great but they've only gone for two or three seasons so like
1755280	1759360	it's nice when they're kind of in that thing but i don't know what tomorrow is so i'm okay
1759360	1764000	i mean everything i work on fucking lasts forever too because i fucking shit gold
1764000	1773040	it's cold i love the new season of acceptable tv by the way i've never failed
1777440	1783840	god damn it fuck you not you no it says fuck you on your phone yeah yeah so i'm telling you to
1783840	1788800	go fuck yourself oh i i uh you just you did animals uh what did you do first season or second
1788800	1795520	season oh um i did the first season i was um a rat yeah i think i think i may have did
1795520	1805840	they show that one at starburn's my animation studio is that yours um i saw it at uh at like
1805840	1812640	uh the rat party yeah the bar were you invited to that you know it's like it's really touch and go
1812640	1818960	with these guys phil and mike because i can't i can't i can't i can't i just i on the i just
1818960	1824880	ran i just go random now i just i just say i just say hey phil hey mike and like half the time i
1824880	1830080	i nail it oh right like you don't know which one's which did they look alike right i mean
1830080	1837680	they're jewish is that um i thought i thought we have one show where this conversation doesn't
1837680	1842880	happen i know the difference but i was like in a room with them you know what i mean doing
1842880	1847200	i know i've been there i have an office in the same building as them i can go like inspect their
1847200	1851920	faces it's about how much i watch youtube videos and i've frozen the frame and i'm like like
1851920	1857680	someone have a different earlobe someone do something i think they dress differently that's
1857680	1863840	what i noticed well maybe you have racial recognition i have i i'm pretty you know i like
1863840	1867920	to fall back on the face blind phrase but a lot of people say i'm just a prick
1869440	1876240	but but but i think what it is is that your your your brain is battling for glucose the different
1876240	1883280	the different sections of it when you're developing so if catching a frisbee like like makes like
1883280	1889920	your brain think this guy's jam is frisbee and that's going to lead to more of him in the dna
1890640	1895040	so you need to play frisbee with everybody you know so we need to send more resources to the
1895040	1899760	part of your brain that catches and throws frisbees like but you need those early successes
1899760	1904320	to trigger those board meetings you know and i think like recognizing telling the difference
1904320	1910640	between two people who are mocking you right it only makes it worse to humanize though you know
1910640	1915280	like i don't i just i just i guess it's considerate obviously to like remember people but at the same
1915280	1920720	time i'm like who gives a shit it was that was my earliest powers at least i don't know who you
1920720	1928480	are yeah exactly i think it's fun i remember i met uh ryan gosling once ryan you here um
1929840	1935440	but uh it met him very briefly but when i met him i was like hi i'm alia and he was like alia
1935440	1940960	so nice to meet you alia and i was like he's either a Scientologist or just like you know
1941040	1945440	works really hard at remembering people's names and then i ran into him another time and i was
1945440	1949840	like there's no fucking way ryan gosling is gonna remember who i am and he was like alia right and i
1949840	1954800	was just like this is why you're a movie star because like everybody he's working so hard to
1954800	1959600	remember people's names he's also a crime fighter we've learned on this show we one of our one of
1959600	1964080	our very good friends daniel gillies is like like tells has this story we have to drag it out of him
1964080	1968320	because he's one of these like high roady fancy pants he's like he's a real life hero he's like
1968320	1974080	ryan's just a friend um but it's like he's a wonderful person he's a new zealand actor who
1974080	1979600	is like saw news of katrina happening and just went uh i gotta go down there and help like like
1979600	1985840	without and no like no designs on anybody knowing about it so and then he's in the story he's you
1985840	1990720	have to drag it out of him because he knows how it sounds for it but this is the story is that
1990720	1995840	so he called ryan gosling his good friend and ryan was like i'm already on my way
1995840	2003280	ryan's like getting out of bed he's like i'm already on my way look me a flight the part of
2003280	2006800	the story that he leaves out is that ryan was already in new orleans because he was there
2007360	2008880	like shooting destroying the levy
2012400	2019200	so he's the first one on the scene right right yeah i mean yeah i mean it's clever
2019200	2025360	but but you know does it make it just focus you know just act well you know like if you
2025360	2029280	just be a good movie star too you don't have to rig the game like this i'm sure you're a wonderful
2029280	2034480	performer yeah our expectations aren't that high of him right all right well speaking of celebrities
2034480	2040400	and and the culture of them okay wait i think it's time to bring out our san diego comic-con
2040880	2043680	correspondent ryan ridley
2053040	2057920	hello hello oh i'm nervous have we spoken to spencer at all yet did we even say hi to spencer

2064400	2073920	yeah spencer's mic doesn't seem to be doing a thing spencer's doing a bit this is called mute protest
2076720	2080000	spencer before we get to ryan ridley did you enjoy your comic-con experience
2080000	2091280	oh it was great every year it's great i walked 16 miles on saturday friday saturday friday

2116480	2122880	boy i tell you what i said i wonder if it's any different in either direction because of your
2123600	2130240	somewhat famous webbed feet oh it's exactly because my somewhat what famous webbed feet
2131120	2138480	no i have skin it does weird stuff sometimes that's probably why my feet are webbed it's all
2138480	2147040	connected only two toes of my feet are webbed yeah i mean but it would i'm not like a fish man
2150080	2151680	fish don't have facial hair
2154160	2163120	catfish kind of do oh yeah that they do that's i feel like an idiot now also there's the bearded
2163120	2168720	clam

2204640	2209440	he's doing a dance he takes a lot of pride um but they were doing some kind of like he's been
2209440	2213760	doing this like strange promotion for the film like doing midnight screenings and stuff and
2213760	2217840	he did something at comic-con this year where he had an ice cream truck called like ice cream
2217840	2223760	for ice cream something like that um where they were like trying to promote it still and like
2223760	2228080	thomas was there and angela trimmer it was something it obviously it wasn't enough to get
2228080	2234880	me to go but um what's the final girls what's the key scene what's the what's the conceit the conceit
2235680	2240800	and then i want you to perform the key scene okay so i wanted to know what the movies about
2241440	2249040	but but i wanted you to think i went to harvard yeah i did it um it's about uh these kids who go
2249040	2253600	see a movie that the the main girl's mom was in it's like an 80s horror movie and then they get
2253600	2259120	sucked into the movie and they have to escape action hero with the horror genre i believe
2259120	2265280	totally it's a really uh fun romp nice ridley yeah thank you spencer yeah this is why he's this uh
2265280	2272320	the sub controller uh yeah did you also go to harvard sub controller jeff is the
2272320	2277600	controller and i've subed for him occasionally yeah you see it's helpful the whole dynamic i

2347040	2353040	dan for the next segment oh tell us about your party experience ryan ridley so every year alia
2353040	2358720	entertainment or don't entertainment weekly has a party at comic-con and i think it's probably i
2358720	2364160	think it's i think it's like the fanciest of the parties in terms of like like like i i i it starts
2364160	2371040	at nine and then by ten it's filled to fire code and then you can't get in right that's that's me
2371040	2376720	just that i had to kick it off that was my crawl so that you weren't left out of this right so you
2376720	2381840	guys went to this well let me give you some backstory yeah uh i'm in my head a lot this
2381840	2387360	comic-con is weird i i don't know if i should feel more shame less shame more insecure
2388160	2394320	less insecure i don't know which way the compass should spin the what should spin the compass for
2394320	2400000	my psychological state of mind yeah yeah yeah but i'll have you know that i was invited
2400720	2408000	to the hottest party at comic-con the entertainment weekly party and i'll have you know that it was all
2408000	2415200	i was talking about at work for the entire week lording it over everyone's heads on top of the
2415200	2421440	fact that i found out that dan and justin were not invited i'm a writer and rick and morty i
2421440	2426320	should clarify that so you understand the relationship for this this hierarchy and this
2426400	2429680	how did you how did you score this coveted invitation
2430480	2438320	jeff because neither did i know about it nor was i invited i was told by haters
2440240	2448240	that it was my agencies behind the scenes manipulations apparently that's not true
2448240	2454160	the answer i got was it's because i'm cool who told you that yeah did you tell yourself
2454160	2460000	his agent told him that my my agent did tell me that but well what's the wait what's the
2460000	2465600	difference though i thought if you're if you're going down the road of of it's cool to be invited
2465600	2469920	to a hollywood party like you're already in trouble is well isn't it no i'm saying like
2469920	2473680	no i'm happy to go down that road you're right objectively you're already in trouble but
2473680	2477440	i mean you're in trouble when you wake up it's a material universe and i mean it's
2478640	2482400	until we return to the beams of light that we were originally before the big bang
2484960	2492160	which happened so that light could could bounce off stay on target stay on target comic-con 2016
2492880	2498960	uh the uh well i want to know what happened i'm just saying like why is it cool what is the
2498960	2503840	difference if your your agency making manipulations behind the scene why does that make you less
2503840	2509120	cool in terms of a hollywood party i'm just because they're haters they're haters they're
2509120	2516000	trying to detract from his achievements thank you spencer like usual you get me yeah man
2522000	2529520	can i just realize that tonight can i explain something exactly exactly that's what he doesn't
2529520	2534560	get i'm running all the all of this these this experience we're about to talk to all of comic-con
2534560	2538640	the entertainment it's all through a filter it's like i don't belong i shouldn't be here
2538640	2544000	what do these haters say myself give me give me an example of a hater and what a hater said to you
2544000	2551120	about this who is hating that's probably there's one of them co-workers here she is other writers
2551120	2556800	and the staff of rick and morty were they trying associate producers pa's uh were they trying to
2556800	2563360	diminish your potential joy in this party no jeff they were trying to of course that's what
2563360	2568000	they're always they're haters well what happened at the party you walk in you say your name they
2568160	2573280	go see we're on the list hang on hang on ryan but you said you were lording it over everybody
2573280	2578080	so of course you created your own haters you know he did he did do that he came your creator
2578080	2586320	your hater party and it's like of course you're gonna take a shot at that i i didn't even i didn't
2586320	2592560	even stoop to to take the bait i just called my agent said why am i not on the ew list i just
2592560	2601280	found out ryan fucking ridley is exactly exactly haters all right so all right so the first person
2601280	2608160	we saw when we walked in was will port a god damn it spencer just just picture will sass over
2608160	2616240	this story continue and all of a sudden we see are we allowed i mean is this you've been acceptable
2616240	2619280	to talk about these people and what they're doing behind the scenes of things that's the
2619280	2623760	ew party right what do you mean oh i don't know maybe i'm gonna make will forte look bad actually
2623760	2628160	no he was here he was your own judgment okay basically he saw him and he couldn't get in or
2628160	2631680	he didn't want to go in or he clearly came and then changed his mind at some point i don't know
2631680	2634640	what happened but he was like i'm out of here we're going under the bar and this and that i'm
2634640	2639360	looking at that and going what the fuck hope do i have fucking well why i don't understand how this
2639360	2644720	party works they're not letting will forte in i'm sitting here thinking i'm on the list finally
2644720	2648320	i'm on the list the list means nothing what time are you getting there too is this like
2648880	2654080	towards the end towards the file code 10 30 party starts at nine cool time where did it go it's
2654080	2658880	packed i asked multiple friends to see if i my friend could get in and they're like it's already
2658880	2665040	at capacity that seems like it's going to be like rough to get you a on the list and then be in so
2665040	2668800	the only thing that haunts me about that is that we did well the entire time we were standing
2668800	2674480	outside waiting to be let in uh uh there was one exception to that rule there seemed to be a
2674480	2681360	biting by strict fire code in letting people in except the fucking workaholics guys right past us
2681360	2686320	i don't know what they may like phone comicon those dudes it feels like i did like they they
2686320	2693680	they like our our glib uh enmity is becoming real now i'm i'm so jealous of them and there were
2693680	2698160	professional football players who i was told were professional football players standing there
2698160	2702960	i i didn't recognize them certainly but there are people will forties getting turned away we're
2703040	2707840	sitting here dan harmon i guess he's a big deal they're not letting any of us in and all of a
2707840	2713040	sudden the fucking workaholics two-thirds of them by the way which one was missing i don't know the
2713040	2717360	the one in the pitch perfect movie well obviously the ironically the actual workaholic from their
2717360	2723360	troop you know the guy who's back in l.a and making phone calls he's working yeah stop being a movie
2723360	2727840	and they get the whistle on the wave yeah and they just stroll right past last comic con i was
2727840	2731760	hanging out with them and tom green rolled up and was like you guys want to smoke some weed
2732560	2739600	all right and we were smoking in a hotel lobby with tom green and the workaholics dude the uh
2739600	2745440	those those guys the first time i ran into him at comic-con they it was i had to find out
2745440	2748960	retroactively after a guy talked to me for a half hour asking a bunch of weird questions
2748960	2753360	about new zealand um that they had convinced that guy that i was peter jackson
2753360	2762480	oh that's a great joke it was it was really funny that is like though the only guy who
2762480	2768560	arguably was hurt by it was a guy who kind of like i guess in the in the in practical joke karma
2768560	2773280	like he was like he should if he's such a fan of peter fucking jackson he should know i'm not peter
2773280	2780800	jackson right like i don't have an accent i but he he was definitely he was a little traumatized
2780800	2784640	i mean he was like because he because the punchline of the story is the guys like after like his
2784640	2789840	third he's like i said i've never been to new zealand and the other guy's like okay very funny
2789840	2794000	but like like when you're shooting there like one other thing and i was like when i was shoot when
2794000	2800560	i'm shooting there i don't know i'm a writer and the guy went those fucking guys told me you were
2800560	2807040	peter jackson like he was so he looked over at that they couldn't have written it better like
2807280	2811200	and i was like you assholes and they were like they they were i wouldn't even say they were
2811200	2814560	cracking up because they probably do that every five minutes they're like they're almost like bored
2814560	2822240	by their own sensibilities they're like we know it's funny yeah no i like those guys so you guys
2822240	2826800	got into the party eventually yeah what happened in the party man you were dan you were saying
2826800	2833280	earlier that there was a control bouncer guy that was going a little over the edge he no no no human
2833280	2838640	beings should be given that much power like like there's always checks and balances there was a 25
2838640	2842960	year old kid who for the first time in his life was like you know he's like telling people he might
2842960	2847920	recognize from movies and stuff they can't come in he was like told to hold the line and he he
2847920	2856320	fucking snapped isn't always on time he he was he was he was inconsolably like like he just he had
2856320	2862240	lost his mind he was like uh he was like the guy that tom cruz has to kill in the basement in uh
2862320	2868560	war of the worlds like he's like like like he had just become like more strategy than man
2869840	2874560	to the point where he was his own mother's like what are you doing because because we got we got
2874560	2881760	we got this happened this happened twice like uh we got waved by my you know my friend dan sneerson
2881760	2885200	who i happen to have on my files i'm like i do i know a guy from entertainment weekly and
2885200	2893040	dan sneerson uh comes out uh gives go because he's anticipating that it should be pretty easy
2893040	2899760	to get somebody in it and he works there so he waves me forward so we have to walk past all the
2899760	2904960	people that can't get in and we stand there but then the bouncer guy was like like man it sounds
2904960	2911200	like like his head was just wagging all the time like he like like everything that was being said
2911200	2916080	to him was uh go fuck yourself and your whole family and also and then whatever you were actually
2916080	2922480	saying like he was just like adding yeah like and i was like i said i did i got a little smile out
2922480	2927680	of him i think i diffused him just a hair because he's kept doing that and i said like like like
2927680	2933520	you're gonna be i said you're gonna be fine like like no one is gonna get in there and i would not
2933520	2937840	have come up here if i hadn't i had been i had been led to believe that it was like you're doing
2937840	2942400	fine or something and he i think but i think that just hit him like a drop of carbohydrates
2942400	2947280	like it just like made his maybe he was just like showing teeth you know like maybe i misinterpreted
2947280	2953920	as a smile anyways hard to get into the party but you're welcome because eventually dan sneerson
2953920	2958240	who is the mensch of the millennia because this guy this guy could have just blown me off i have
2958240	2961840	never talked to him such a terrible dynamic too and you're like i don't even want to go to the
2961840	2965760	stupid party that they won't let me in but then it gets to the point where you're like i have to
2965760	2971440	get into the story wait dan are you saying all i want are you saying that without you dan harman
2971440	2978800	and dan sneerson the the improbably named dan sneerson uh that ryan fucking ridley wouldn't
2978800	2982800	have got into that part i don't yeah no wait we were all on the list like it was this was about
2982800	2988160	fire code okay this is about games is what it was let's be honest why invite people to a party
2988160	2992240	say rsvp with a plus one and then you'll be able to get into the party and suddenly now
2993120	2996640	you can't get to this level oh now you can get to this level but there's nine more levels after
2996640	3002000	that what the fuck kind of game are they playing why are they doing this to me hollywood i'm the
3002000	3006080	hero of the story i don't know if the audience i feel like is like this guy's the fucking villain
3006080	3011520	the story i'm the hero of the story i'm the hero this isn't my world i don't get invited to these
3011520	3015200	parties and i'm like oh i'm getting by this party and i brought my best friend from girl
3015200	3019680	from childhood that we've known since we're eight years old he's never even he's never even met a
3019680	3024720	celebrity he's ever been in california and i'm giving him the time of his life he's getting high
3024720	3031280	with the waif on the yacht he's with the dr drew and easy e giving him nuggies and stuff but this
3031280	3039120	party i mean this guy dr drew and an easy or dr dray and easy which is the one that gives advice on
3039120	3046160	tv shows okay dr drew yeah those two were together i don't know because easy easy they're
3046160	3054880	easy he's dead the young actor who played easy i'm not an idiot he was the one that was with dr
3054880	3059360	drew but do you do you think do you think they thought it was funny that he was hanging out with
3059360	3064560	with dr dr drew it was like kind of like dr dray do you think all kinds of strange pairings at
3064560	3071360	this party you wouldn't believe it such as such as well i can i can i really just want to
3071360	3076160	brag this isn't funny at all but like uh what do you you're gonna take us across the threshold
3076160	3081440	of the party right hopefully but i do just want to add that uh danny mcbride like like came up to
3081440	3086400	me and because he's a he's a fan i don't i don't know if he's a fan of the podcaster if he's just
3086400	3090720	just rick and morty i can't now i can't remember but he probably just want something tells me it's
3090720	3097920	rick and morty he he wanted to meet the podcast it's exciting right okay who's like somebody that
3098480	3104960	podcasts in a new trailer for justice league anybody know about that little ditty thank you
3106000	3112720	thank you he's he's he's he's an unacquireable taste just it's like george
3115600	3120720	you just i wish i was at the party with you yeah to see it through your eyes remember my hijinks
3120720	3125840	i was yelling at people oh it's great to have hi i always do pranks i'm so serious these
3125840	3132560	hollywood people so serious at this party he just stood up everybody jesus christ he dropped
3132560	3137520	get back he dropped that microphone on accident and then did what a cat would do which is just
3137520	3146400	he's he turned it into grooming himself it was so clearly an accident so so ryan you are the
3146400	3151840	self-proclaimed hero of the story you've just walked us across the first threshold i believe
3151840	3161280	right when you become active what what happens well give us a key scene we find out that dan
3161280	3170160	schnirson can get us into the next area which is just another place to wait to get into the party
3170160	3174800	but a little bit nicer well i will say a lot nicer like like because there were he was he
3174800	3180000	kept bringing us hot dogs and drinks this guy who's like a right works at entertainment weekly
3180000	3185520	who interviewed me about heat vision and jack 20 years ago like like is and he's done you know
3185520	3191200	we've we i guess i mean i think i i would say that maybe it's that because of that we have like
3191200	3195680	this bond like because he's done interviews with me since then and so we kind of like we were kind
3195680	3201520	of like kids kids in the industry together alia like like there was a fraternal bond there maybe
3201520	3206160	or maybe he's just like a super fucking amazing probably like i'm sorry this is so fucked up i
3206240	3210640	know but it was like his his party and so he was missing it and he brought us hot dogs and he was
3210640	3217040	tech taking drink orders but and and and the party was so crowded and then this waiting area
3217040	3222800	is this like in a hotel like i want to get a sense like the hard rock cafe oh my god and so
3222800	3226880	the way i just blew my mind okay i was i was my i was at my happiest there because there were hot
3226880	3234160	dogs and like i kept i kept thinking like oh if you just flipped it like easily like that crowded
3234160	3239520	hot area like if you if you if johnny depp was over here and you were told that this was like
3239520	3242960	the platinum yeah then that would be the area because it's like a place where you can go like
3242960	3247440	this and less like like you ever go to the viper room and it's like like like so it's it's weird
3247440	3252320	that culture of like like oh these this little tiny booth that's like a like having a table is
3252320	3257440	a vip thing at the viper room like like and it's like but if you put that table anywhere else
3257440	3262480	you'd be like i'm doing you a favor by sitting here this is really uncomfortable yeah is we got
3262560	3267440	to the party the waiting area and it was open there was it was just the six of us that were
3267440	3272960	together and we're at this table and by the way immediately open bar spread out gray good magical
3272960	3279440	amazing wonderful fresh air and they're bringing us churros and hot dogs and we're laughing and
3279440	3284800	we're vaping and we're having a good time but i'm still thinking but i want to get in fucking air
3284800	3290240	which looks miserable why did they do this to us it's about the yeah it's about the search it became
3290240	3294880	a game of course it became a game right that's what we decided it was because i would have
3294880	3302000	tolerated if it wasn't the the sneer sense factor turned it into like a role-playing game because
3302000	3306480	it was like there was a there was a thing that needed to be unlocked like a like minecraft or
3306480	3309600	something like that you needed to make something to make something to make something and i would
3309600	3313840	i did get that's the longest i've ever waited for anything and i like and i was like i was
3313840	3318000	kind of held together with this sort of quest aspect of it because they kept saying five more
3318000	3321440	minutes and then we'll go and then you know what i mean and then you go like well maybe five more
3321440	3324800	minutes after that too and then you because you just you don't want it you know it's like gambling
3326000	3330640	ryan you talked so much shit to your co-workers for the past seven days that you you now have to
3330640	3335520	get into this party you can't go back home with your tail between your legs and say that you
3335520	3341440	didn't get in and that was fueling every fiber of my being that night so here's the weird thing
3341440	3346720	about the party you finally get you probably get past the threshold and the party it's around a
3346720	3351520	pool in a can i tell one little detail that's going to come back later in the story so while
3351520	3356640	we were out there i was trying to you know play the game of like all right you know let's have a
3356640	3360160	little fun with the situation i knew we were the losers technically and there are the winners and
3360160	3364560	there on the other side you know and they bring us hot dogs so i there's a room that had like a
3364560	3370720	patio that went out to kind of our area but it was also on the other side of it was the real party
3370720	3374960	and there was a private room these people were in i didn't see who was in it i grabbed the hot dog
3374960	3378800	and i went up to that and i leaned over and go yeah you guys might be in that party but you don't
3378800	3383600	have hot dogs you know and they're kind of like not looking at me basically acting like you guys
3383600	3387520	they can hear you though there's no like wall between you two no there's no wall no it was
3387520	3393840	like a plexiglass like pope mobile wall it was like bulletproof like this is gonna pay off later
3393840	3398640	this is gonna pay off they whoever was in there definitely heard me screaming this is gonna pay
3398640	3402080	off later so you're just yelling at strangers Taylor Swift because that's who you were yelling
3402160	3408240	at did you not know i was yelling at the Hollywood elite Jeff so far so far you are
3409120	3416160	definitely the hero of the story thank you there's no dispute there so remember that
3416160	3425360	detail so then we get finally led into the grand event okay so so it's in the courtyard of a hotel
3425360	3432240	and uh there's a pool and so you're partying around the pool and uh but in the pool because
3432240	3440000	what are you gonna what are you gonna put in the pool like awards uh there's water in it but what
3440000	3445680	do you what do you do do you put like uh copies of your magazine they'll get wet you know like i
3445680	3454000	don't know so you put you put a grease shark and a bunch of cones so in the pool is like is a bunch
3454000	3458640	of the uh it's the what do you call them lifesavers the is that what you call them the
3459520	3463120	inner tubes yeah when they're when they're like yeah like floating yeah they're like little
3463120	3470640	smaller inner tubes and uh and but and also a bunch of young people like that were hired
3470640	3475280	like models they were just like bathing suits just like yeah here's just like treading water
3475280	3479520	and like like hanging out on the floaties and it was like and everyone was just like kind of
3479520	3485280	staring at them like like like we were all no matter how famous you were if you were out of the
3485280	3490480	pool because they were in the pool you were better than them you were all you were yeah but
3490480	3494400	simultaneously reduced to like it was like like the white haired guy that shows up at the party
3494400	3499440	on boogie nights that ends up like having to have the coke girl like like like like that guy with
3499440	3503600	the gray hair that like just looks at wallberg's dick and then it's like yeah pretty nice
3503600	3509440	it's nice to meet you that's kind of like weird jackie gleason
3510080	3514320	jeff the killer like guy um and they're all like pruney and like forced to say and though they're
3514320	3519840	like i'm so thirsty but we're like yeah because we're like what are we all what else how many
3519840	3525120	yeah so everyone's just staring at these people at pool and i'll tell you like i i i was kind of like
3525120	3529040	like like and somebody came up to me and said can we ask you some questions like what do you think
3529120	3534960	about this pool thing um and people in the pool this question no they asked me what i thought of
3534960	3539200	the people in the pool oh i said and i said i i just can't get over the fact that like the like
3539200	3545760	like the crazy thing is that right now if i got into the pool that would be the weird thing right
3547760	3551280	that yeah i was just like freaking out about that so i'm standing at a hotel and i'm in
3551280	3556160	the courtyard of a hotel and and there are humans being used as art
3556160	3564560	i hope they don't i could ruin everything by using the pool right like dad or go to the pool
3564560	3569280	or just anybody though it was like a family from iowa got in the pool it was everyone would be like
3569280	3576880	jesus christ do something there's a lot of talk about me going in the pool in my own head and i
3576880	3583680	was like trying to wave like this could be the coolest move ever i'd be the guy you fucking
3583760	3589760	why fuck the facade of the veneer if we're all too cool to go in the pool and this fucking party
3589760	3594320	i'm gonna go in and everybody will talk about me and know my name i hate the hollywood elites
3594320	3600960	i hate them did the pool people count towards the capacity of the fire coat because that's
3600960	3605600	stupid as fuck i don't i think they were technically they're fireproof because they're
3605600	3610560	way they are in water they're there to watch everybody burn they're the only people that
3610800	3614160	they could live through a fire for like 36 hours like until all the water evaporated then
3614160	3619760	they'd be like it's getting hot in this pool but they've got all of that time to you know like
3619760	3624880	we're still on the clock man now what what were these how many how many of these model swimmers
3624880	3629440	were there they were like a bit i'm gonna say i think they were like shifting there was a little
3629440	3633120	bit of a rotation there they got breaks looked like there was seven or eight seven or eight
3633120	3638640	the thing that really threw me because i was just like watching i was i was super high uh and and
3638720	3642880	so the whole thing had like this weird like kind of like that was that's weird it just makes you feel
3642880	3647680	but that's i kind of appreciate that stuff because then you get the luxury of feeling like hunter s
3647680	3652640	thompson like like that's a favor they're doing you like it's like oh this this party is crazy
3652640	3656560	like i have i kind of feel like if it wasn't we'd be disappointed you know if there wasn't
3656560	3660640	like some weird fucking thing that you can like roll your eyes out of those parties is like how
3660640	3663840	odd they are that they're like humans are treated differently it's not like you're gonna play
3664560	3669440	you're more important for this like 20 minutes yeah and you're like okay i guess i can shit
3669440	3674080	on your face and that's okay and they're like it would be kind of okay well yeah david cross has
3674080	3678960	that has that has that extended pit about like when you when desserts have like gold leaf on them
3678960	3686720	and it's just like fuck you i can't even digest this i'm just gonna shit it out of my asshole
3686720	3693760	after you serve it to me it's gold i like it is like it's like what the we use interchangeably
3693760	3700480	words like uh you know like red carpet stuff like luxury pizzazz glamour the la la land and all the
3700480	3705040	stuff but it's like all it is it's just like we're seedy it's just this fantasy of like holy shit
3705040	3711680	like what we're in the running man and like you're running and i'm not like like like so that's why
3712000	3717120	anyways like and if you if you if you called something a vip something i'm in like i'd pay
3717120	3723120	50 for the letters vip to be added to an otherwise identical ticket that i had into an empty
3723120	3729040	warehouse where nothing happened except farts like like but but but if i'm going then i want
3729040	3736160	the vip ticket to the fart house but but but so so the weird thing for me the deal breaker was i
3736160	3740000	wasn't like offended by any of it i wasn't like i was just like high and like kind of going this
3740000	3746320	is funny like like it's like i always like this is a good chance for me to pretend i'm in the first
3746320	3750400	scene of someone's biopic you know like because it's like the camera's got to be coming down on
3750400	3755840	this like because it could cost money to produce this set so so like and there's like a bunch of
3755840	3760480	people here so those must be maybe frank eyes is meeting someone in the corner or like like like
3760480	3765840	this is 1978 yeah like yeah i feel like i'm part of a panning thing it's like yeah and i'm going
3765840	3770240	like the thing about community like like what would i have to say to be to be recognizable in
3770240	3776800	this like panning shot bing dang dang dang dang dang dang dang bow down on just boogie fever whatever
3776800	3783040	yeah um the uh so so so but the thing that really threw me about the pool thing was this there was
3783040	3788880	this one kid this dude he kept there was music playing and he was like he kept like rapping
3789600	3794160	he was like like if it was hip hop he would like he was like he was like rapping along with the
3794160	3799200	music and i was really tired to just swim in the pool yeah it was throwing me because he
3799200	3804960	was like sending this direct visual and audio signal it's like no i'm here in the at the same
3804960	3810480	party like this is all happening to all of us at the same time and it was like stop it
3811200	3816320	like you're supposed to be like like you're supposed to like like yeah like like you're
3816320	3822800	supposed to be detached like it would be like if a burger grew legs right like on your bun and
3822880	3827840	tried to like it was like you'd be like you'd be like this is bad and the chef would be like no i
3827840	3832720	think that's great it's you like beef don't you and you'd be like no i like discs of meat
3834160	3838000	were the other people in the pool being like henry what are you doing i don't know i think
3838000	3840880	they were like i think they would maybe they float away from him a little bit because they're
3840880	3845440	like i don't mind going i'm not fucking pitching my inner tube to that star there's one pool person
3845440	3848880	that was showboat and you're saying is that what the gist of this was okay he was just having a
3848880	3854800	good time what i'm saying is that's the reason why he was doing the thing that threw me it's not
3854800	3860080	his it's not his good time that threw me what threw me was the actual just audio visual stimulus of
3860640	3866080	him him him like instead of just floating aimlessly in the pool which i would thought
3866080	3870720	was like oh it's like future art like handsome people in the pool like like like yeah you're
3870720	3876240	sexy like like like like like be our pool like like like like like it's a cauldron we're witches
3876320	3880000	we're like boiling you and your essence is like and then one of them's like
3882640	3887360	stop yeah you take like a canoe or kind of stir them a little bit like there's just like
3890720	3895680	there's one guy at every aw party that's like okay herman can't he's gotta he's always got
3895680	3901040	a man in the pool he keeps flipping the actors in the pool what do you what do you think the
3901040	3905760	explanation was do you think that it was they all lined up before they got in the pool and
3905840	3909200	and their boss said all right listen here are the rules this that and the other thing that breaks
3909200	3914720	her every 15 minutes doesn't that and also no don't just zone out and stare dead-eye and kind
3914720	3920080	of float around don't talk just have fun with them just be yourself yeah and then he was the
3920080	3925440	one who broke the rule or or was the opposite and they were like you guys have fun rap riffs with
3925440	3929280	the yell up at the celebrities and do bits with them and have fun making a show and they're all
3929280	3933920	like these idiots are not doing anything he's like well i'm fucking doing it no yeah maybe he's like
3934000	3938000	yeah it could easily be that the rest of them are like fuck this i'm going dead inside yeah
3938800	3943520	or we don't know like something like like you hear that that list leaked to Kanye like people
3943520	3948160	like oh Kanye's so crazy because he wants such specific things but like think about it he was
3948160	3952240	like he was doing the same thing and so the list was like don't make eye contact it was like a
3952240	3957360	really specific list of like things that human art should do at a party well i kind of get it
3957360	3963360	if you're gonna go through the threshold as i would never of using humans as art i understand
3963440	3967280	like having a very meticulous list of like i want to do something really specific here
3967280	3969440	like where where every five seconds you all go
3972480	3976720	or i want you all to coordinate emotionally i want you all to feel
3977440	3983680	the real effect of the art right yeah yeah is that like humans doing something not natural
3983680	3987760	yeah yeah it should be like a screen saver where you're like okay they're doing this again it's
3987760	3991280	floating yeah but there was a kid that shapes gonna float by again there it is there it is you
3991280	3996000	know he was like patting the water and making little splishies like look to the beat this all
3996000	4001920	makes sense i love hip-hop all day long i like and it was like somebody stun him he must he must
4001920	4008880	have been running the tape a tape a taser to one of these sticks we use because because he was
4008880	4012880	showing humanity and that breaks your heart they're like oh he's actually it was a reminder yes
4012880	4017680	because then it becomes then now you're at a party with strangers some of whom can't get out of the
4017680	4025040	pool yeah as opposed to being at a party where humans are art yes exactly do you think any of
4025040	4031280	these people in the pool knew that there was actually a hero in their midst who was contemplating
4033280	4039360	all odds to save i know a kindred spirit when i see one and this guy you know what else he did uh
4039360	4043600	kenny powers walked by and all of a sudden he started going he was the only one of the pool
4043600	4049280	people he just started going we're not worthy we're not worthy and i was like that's the fucking
4049280	4056880	dork and then kind of beat later i was like that's me i'm that pool guy yeah i kind of
4056880	4061040	felt like when they were getting their pictures with people it was toward the end of the party
4061040	4064880	and it was like people charging out of the field after like a soccer game or something like you
4064880	4069040	got five minutes yeah i think they were like okay all right get your fucking autographs
4070000	4075840	i get the fuck out i think it's time for me to to bring back a little plot point in our story
4075840	4082560	oh which one so just when you go through the first threshold and you wait in the first level
4082560	4086320	of purgatory and then the second level then the hot dog's gonna be finally getting to what you
4086320	4092480	think is the promised land and you wander around and you're like oh more game of thronesers and
4092480	4095600	you know you're just rubbing up against them and you don't care and there's the guys from arrow and
4095600	4100880	this and it's like a living wax museum and all i'm doing with my buddy who's never even met a
4100880	4104720	celebrity just like look at that person look at that person look at and we're here too and we're
4104720	4110400	all sharing the same air and i walk up to this one goddamn room and i'm like well i'm in i worked
4110400	4116240	hard for this i'm going everywhere i'm gonna use the whole buffalo of this party and i walked up
4116240	4122640	to this fucking room and i look in this room emergency exit and there's two giant dudes
4122720	4125840	sitting there but they could have been just regular guys i couldn't quite tell her and
4125840	4132960	wearing polo shirts and i look past him and i see james cameron oh yeah there was once
4132960	4138160	more level of elite and on the side of this fucking concentric circle of eliteness just
4138160	4143680	what you think we're all one now we're all the hollywood elite fuck everybody else is he alone
4143680	4150160	in the room or what's his little area yeah he has no equals just him he's waiting for steve
4150160	4155520	job's ghost like floated before he can have a conversation he's the loneliest guy in showbiz
4155520	4162640	everybody knows that heavy lies the crowd okay it's celebrity highlander
4165280	4169440	actually there was a point when there's a whistle in a wave and the pool guy got up and went into the
4172320	4175120	pleased him with his rapping bring me the spry lad
4175120	4182400	he's like so you're comfortable in water for that long just cut to the eli raw thing with james

4241040	4246160	by the way if you haven't guessed already that was the room that i yelled about the hot dogs into

4594960	4598960	such a young age i'm just here's here's a projection i'm making oh i can't wait it's like
4598960	4604400	you in order to survive with your sanity this this this this silly business like you've had to
4604400	4610720	like you know become like pretty well balanced like or your alternative was to end up like knocking
4610720	4616400	over liquor stores and like like whatever just to get my high yeah like like so you have you've

5184560	5194480	toward its dreams and the camera swivels over and it's stephen hawking the guy like i walked
5194480	5199440	away having been rejected my rick and morty credibility the only shred of it i have was

5215280	5221040	what could happen next we'll have to find out i hope that while ryan was waiting in the exhibit
5221040	5226720	hall he was wearing comfortable underwear i mean if you go to a to a convention hall and you're
5226720	5233520	wearing less than the most comfortable underwear in the world i mean you're you're your own worst
5233520	5243040	enemy be you man lady or or any part of the continuum on which we exist gender-wise that
5243040	5251760	was close i thought you the slippery shark yeah he's falling asleep yeah that's the thing is of
5251760	5256000	like but i really could never get past the history channel thing i've always called it the history
5256000	5263120	channel john lewis also has a new show on history i guess i'm as dan harman i end up in a lot of
5263120	5276640	sticky situations but my underwear is anything but it stays smooth like i like a like an 80s
5276640	5285760	shammy when i when i run my hand across my fanny um if you're listening from the united kingdom that
5285760	5294640	means uh but i think it means vagina i'm telling the british people oh yeah yeah sorry sorry sorry
5294640	5301200	sorry everybody uh sorry me andi in my soft silky well silky sounds like look let me tell you about
5301200	5310560	me undies it's uh i want to explain something to you that uh you may not have known like we've
5310560	5317120	been living in a marginalized uh world like i'm not saying it's the matrix like like like we don't
5317120	5321760	know what's a simulation of what isn't but we do know that with it relative to this reality
5321760	5331120	we are being marginalized uh uh uh point if you drink uh uh uh seven up every time you
5331680	5336000	experience anxiety and it makes you feel better you're gonna form an addiction to seven up your
5336000	5341200	neurology is going to form a relationship with the things that provide it comfort and as time
5341200	5345840	goes on it gets more and more complicated it comes a point when you don't know if what you're
5345840	5351920	doing is what you want to do or if what you need to do you won't even be able to tell the difference
5351920	5357680	uh is for those of you have ever uh known someone with an addiction like you don't know whether you
5357680	5363440	want or to do something or whether you think you want to do something um my point being that uh
5364000	5370160	like it it it shit well why did i go down that road you're ever you're doing
5370160	5375840	advertising you're talking about you're talking about your poopy underwears well i will wait oh
5375840	5381440	oh okay okay so what it should occur to you then that oh my god if it's possible to have a fucked
5381440	5389760	up weird relationship with video games or alcohol or or or a certain restaurant um where something
5389760	5394480	becomes like a compulsion at addiction then can you can you imagine the things that you're not
5394480	5400880	being told have been baked into your neurology by a generation that was already raised in artifice
5400880	5405600	that was here well before you got here and was in charge of everything you ever saw or heard you can
5405600	5411360	imagine the possibility therefore that that it is possible for you to live on a limited plane of
5411360	5416720	existence with absolutely no consciousness of what you could be um enter me undies
5419200	5426800	wow the underwear company that that that stood back and said what is underwear like why does
5426800	5433200	it feel the way it feels in a sea of people i'm sure that that no longer worked there that said
5433200	5440880	uh what it's not that complicated bro i'm a fucking sexist pig i don't work at me undies
5440880	5447680	i'm a piece of shit what's it matter bro if it ain't bro ken don't fix it bro
5449440	5457280	i'm a bro that was beautiful don't bro can fix it bro and me undies took those people and they
5457280	5463040	just put them in the airlock and they and as their silent screams fell on no ears but their own
5463040	5469600	they were flushed into space their body succumbed to the vacuum that that pre-existed time and they
5469600	5477840	were dealt with the way god deals with uh with with with with with you know bros um and then
5477840	5482720	and then the only people left were people that that that are that are that live within a world
5482720	5488160	where underwear can be more comfortable than you thought possible uh are they promoting the show
5488160	5494400	or something a little bit maybe i guess we're promoting no alia alia don't be so cynical dan
5494400	5498720	is just passionate about his underwear i love me undies it's the only undies i wear have you put

6266160	6272560	i can't be like are you no this is the key moment of the story i was trying to say i knew
6272560	6276960	the guy was big he had glasses i didn't know his name you mean mustafa i go i go she goes
6276960	6283200	she goes uh maybe joel but he's the shorter guy i go wait can you can we we need to does anyone
6283200	6286400	know what's going on here with this woman what she's doing she's shaming me because i described
6286400	6291520	him as the bigger guy wait but we need to know though what something that only you know right
6291520	6298000	now and she which is me not being when you say bigger is describe tell us the description of
6298000	6302480	this guy because we don't know if he's nine feet tall or not are you talking about nine feet tall
6302480	6307840	he was you meant fat he was just he was stocky okay i don't know he was he was physically bigger
6307840	6312800	i don't know what else to say it glasses and he was there was no other characteristics that was
6312800	6317120	it he was a white guy with glasses and he was kind of bigger i don't know what else to say you just
6317120	6324720	described 80 of the people at kamikaze how many of them are working at this booth but she looked at
6324720	6329920	me she goes you mean the shorter guy the shorter guy i'm like oh sorry so it's okay to call him
6329920	6335360	the shorter guy that's the correct dimension to focus on she's like sir i'm just trying to help
6335360	6343600	you find this guy okay cool height is cool but i can't right i gotta say it's my pet peeve when
6343600	6349280	people tell me i'm overthinking or i'm projecting it's in my head like but you i mean i really think
6349280	6354880	that you're i i i believe that what you the piece that you're missing is that she is actually
6355440	6361600	she knows six people no she's trying to help you identify and you said bigger and she said no she
6361600	6367280	was she was diplomatic you mean not to shame you but diplomatically saying tall big by bigger do
6367280	6372320	you mean the fat one she was doing you she was just skirting the issue dan do you not think i
6372320	6379760	know when people don't like me she was looking me in the eye and saying the words you mean the
6379760	6385040	shorter one do you really think there was like she was actually like like like why would i tell
6385040	6389200	this story if it was like i knew there was 10 percent of a chance that i'm just delusional maniac
6389200	6393920	like serentino and dustle don i see juliet lewis saying eat my pussy and i that's not really what
6393920	6397920	she said she said something else yes she was shaming me i still don't think james cameron
6397920	6404640	saw you yell about hot dogs that's that's the point of delusions is that you don't know
6406720	6410480	this is all going on in your head and she's like showing you pictures she's like this guy this
6410480	6415680	guy and you're like she thinks i'm crazy she thinks i'm this and then she's like hello anybody
6415680	6423520	all right well here he is then he just left if i knew three guys and one was tall and skinny
6423520	6429920	and one was short and fat and one was tall and bigger all around and you were trying to

6434400	6439040	foot my mouth i go the fat one i like like like i don't know but but i'm saying like that is
6439040	6445920	given that situation that's that's the best like most courteous way of that's that's all i'm saying
6445920	6451520	but you're i think i will i will believe you if you simply tell me because you just keep saying
6451520	6456160	she's saying the shorter one but what i want to hear from you is you're saying regardless of her
6456160	6463200	words it was very clear from her face very clear judging you okay i will i'll take a flyer as clear

6730000	6734320	yeah exactly my therapist says like when you're up you're you're up at that setting it's like
6734320	6739520	that was the only environment in which this pokemon thing could have like because it either
6739520	6744240	it's because we wanted a distraction or it's because we were just so fucking amped up and
6744240	6748880	that game was about being kind of i guess it was like you know i'm not saying like it was random

6958080	6963120	that's all it was because it was just like woman gets carjacked while playing pokemon like she was
6963120	6967040	using her cell phone like yeah she was probably was playing pokemon but it's like it's like it's
6967040	6972160	like it was just ubiquity that's what was it like like the the you're clicking on these articles
6972160	6977360	and going like oh pokemon is so important and so and the cause of people killing themselves it's
6977360	6981520	like no everyone's doing it with their phones before that like like there's a guy who uses
6981520	6988560	instagram before he uh like joins a race gang right like like like it just wasn't news because
6988560	6992640	it wasn't so anyways it's pokemon the reason why people i mean not the only reason but the
6992640	6997360	reason why people like is because like it does physically make you look for things yeah right
6997360	7002160	like you're actually walking around so the holocaust museum said yeah don't please just can you
7002160	7006080	not pokemon while you're looking at the piles of because we're trying to yeah we're trying
7006080	7010800	to do something for sale here and it's not do you think the holocaust museum is not what you're
7010800	7015280	buying do you think the holocaust museum is like a gym or a poke stop it was it was a poke stop
7015280	7018480	because they were like they do they use landmarks and stuff and there's only so many landmarks that
7018480	7022560	would bother to say can you please not you know because jesus christ you know who didn't have any
7022560	7030080	problem the the tolerance museum what is that by the way what is the topic oh jeff jeff i should
7030080	7038080	clarify this isn't the holocaust museum that loves holocaust i think it is a form of
7041200	7046160	i don't know how many holocaust museums are there like a simpler time
7048400	7054640	join me won't you i'm harry holocaust and we don't agree with everything that happened
7054640	7060240	back then we're just saying uh people had lemonade and like like like like take a
7060240	7065120	take a trip back with us like and it's all like there's t-shirts no it was a it was it's the
7065120	7070240	holocaust museum and and but the so the article is just it's a non-news piece because it's just
7070240	7074160	like they're just going can we not be a poke stop like obviously we shouldn't be a poke stop
7074160	7077680	like because there's people there's miterans and there's you're just people running and they're
7077680	7082000	going like this place is lousy and so the only article was just like they're asking you to please
7082000	7087360	not do that and then but then i know i know it was a fake quote it had to be a fake quote because
7087360	7094800	the last paragraph was uh uh it's not like we came here to play the game says uh annie 37 or
7094800	7098400	something i can't remember my name was i remember the age was 37 because it just sounds like a fake
7098400	7102480	age it sounds like maybe they're like we don't want it to be like like like like it just sounds
7102480	7106800	fake but it's like whose name is withheld because she didn't want to this so it's like fake fake
7106800	7110880	fake fake and then it's the last like she goes because it's continuing her quote it's not like
7110880	7116880	we came here to play the game says annie something 37 uh who withheld her last name but gotta catch
7116880	7125200	them all and it was like come on so fake all of these headlines or all these articles about
7125200	7129760	pokemon go are coming out as fake too you know they already did all the craziest ones they did
7129760	7134320	like you know how they have those ads on Santa Monica Boulevard for like AIDS testing they
7134320	7140240	already have a pokemon one like we're gonna catch them all right about STDs and i was like
7143040	7147360	my girlfriend and i watched porn together and so we keep we're at comic-con we're like oh my god
7147360	7153120	there must be like 70 pokemon porns already oh so there's like ones where there's like the
7153120	7157120	simpsons porn oh yeah something like they're like covered in makeup and stuff yeah it's very
7157120	7161120	weird yeah but there's but there's like once right there's a guy on a hoverboard there's this guy
7161120	7165600	it's like absolutely when hoverboards became big enough that there was a cuckold video and you know
7165600	7170880	what cuckold porn is no i don't cuckold porn is like guys like well maybe i shouldn't limit it to
7170880	7176480	gender but i think it's traditionally it's a guy like who is getting fucked around on either and
7176480	7181920	either he's into it or he's not fucked around on his girl is cheating on like typically he has to
7181920	7187520	watch like he can't do anything about it because his dick is smaller and he's on a hoverboard he
7187520	7191920	was the the cuckold was on a hoverboard and he comes into the porn scene and he goes like i went
7191920	7198640	look i got a i got a hoverboard meep meep moop moop and he's got a helmet on but he and then
7198640	7203120	later on he'll be naked on the hoverboard watching his wife fuck another guy the guy that
7203120	7208800	sold him the hoverboard and just kind of like going like yeah he's like wheeling around the room
7208800	7212960	you have to find this nervously i thought we already talked about this because yeah because
7212960	7218400	this guy is like a master like you watch a man control a scene from the lowest status position
7218400	7222800	like it's almost it's bad cuckold porn because he's running the fucking show because he's like
7222800	7227040	a robot man and and the other two are can't stop laughing and like they're freaking out like they
7227040	7233760	don't this guy's unpredictable he he loves being naked on a hoverboard watching me fuck his wife
7233760	7241360	like i am not the bigger man here she's like i do love him it's unmistakable that his that
7241360	7248240	every every every every figurative cock that's worth anything is his to wield right and i am
7248240	7256400	left with only this absolutely vestigial redundant meat tube which happens to be cosmetically larger
7256400	7263840	diameter but is absolutely powerless in every way this this guy's a star that's what technology
7263840	7268080	does it makes us doubt what we're born with right it's like who did you ever know for in rain man
7268080	7272240	tom cruise i mean he loved justin hoffman and the guy is just like he is like he's like wheeling
7272240	7277120	around the room going like yeah it's like he's like i don't need just a vagina he's like he's
7277120	7281360	like yeah watch it he does everything anyone says is like get over here and lick his balls and then
7281360	7286320	he like how do you play licking another guy's balls because your wife told you to how do you
7286320	7293120	play that high status you don't but if you play it if you love licking those balls and you don't
7293120	7298400	give a fuck about human life like it just seems like he's like he he he just seems like it's all
