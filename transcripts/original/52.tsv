0	28480	Yeah, hello everybody.
28480	38040	Welcome to Meltdown, Harbin Town is once again in session with your lucky little devils.
38040	53280	Once you welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harbin.
53280	61680	Dan Harbin.
61680	62680	Thank you.
62680	63680	Where do we start?
63680	66200	Dan, where's your belt?
66200	69480	I forgot to wear a belt because I've been off my diet for so long.
69480	73720	The Easter thing and the, I don't know, there was some point where Aaron and I slipped off
73720	77280	of the wagon, allowed ourselves to just start.
77280	84000	I've been cheating on my diet, quote unquote, for multiple days into weeks and this morning
84000	88000	I put on a pair of pants and I was like, I don't need a belt.
88000	89880	That bowl of Cheetos last night was your belt.
89880	90880	Yeah, exactly.
90880	97880	Like belts are for closers and I, but I forgot that jeans kind of, they expand over time,
97880	103800	you know, as you, so if I dance too much, these will come right around my ankles.
103800	105440	We must enforce that then.
105440	106440	I don't know.
106440	107440	Okay.
107440	120960	And your little chicken dance is perfectly designed to make, to er, shit.
120960	124120	My underwear also jammed around my ass.
124120	127600	So these guys are, these guys got an eye load.
127600	134520	Come on, let's bring them, let's bring them down.
135520	136520	Whoa.
136520	141520	Fuck the queen.
141520	144520	You mean the prime minister.
144520	145520	Margaret Thatcher died.
145520	147520	Did she, you know who else did.
147520	150520	Don't say, oh, you don't give a fuck about Margaret Thatcher.
150520	154520	Oh, no, you should care about Annette from Achela.
154520	155520	She died.
155520	156520	Now say, oh.
156520	157520	Yeah.
157520	158520	Margaret Thatcher boo.
158520	159520	Oh no.
159520	160520	Don't boo a stroke.
160520	162520	A stroke is a bummer.
163520	164520	Roger Ebert died.
164520	165520	Hey.
165520	166520	I don't know.
166520	167520	I don't know.
167520	170520	A guy who only got more and more awesome as he got older.
170520	171520	He did, yeah.
171520	172520	And so on one hand, it was like mission accomplished.
172520	176520	Like he really knocked it out of the park in terms of being a guy.
176520	180520	I'm out of breath from making my pants fall down.
180520	181520	Just milestones.
181520	184520	This is a show about milestones.
184520	186520	I want to, that's good.
186520	188520	That's how I feel about Roger Ebert.
188520	190520	Like we, we kind of got to watch him die.
190520	193520	And he made that, he made no bones about that and kind of made it very
193520	194520	enjoyable.
194520	197520	He got, he owned up to his, his role as a curmudgeon.
197520	200520	As he got older and older, he became more and more of an expert in what he
200520	201520	was talking about.
201520	206520	And he like got more and more bored with unremarkability and, and, and really,
206520	211520	but stayed a civic minded, like, uh, progressive, interesting essayist.
211520	215520	And, uh, I was constantly reading and filling his brain with stuff and
215520	219520	filtering it and giving it out to people like totally seamlessly adapted his
219520	223520	role from a Chicago sun times movie reviewer to an online presence.
223520	228520	And, um, you know, was, was, was more facile than most 25 year olds in terms
228520	231520	of like being out there and, uh, online.
231520	232520	And then, and then he died.
232520	235520	Uh, and he kind of, he kind of wrote a thing saying, uh, uh, oh, I got, I
235520	237520	know I got cancer in my leg or whatever.
237520	242520	And, uh, I, uh, I'll see you guys in a, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna hang back
242520	244520	for a second and I'll see you guys in a couple of days.
244520	245520	And then he died.
245520	246520	Uh, sad.
246520	247520	I don't know.
247520	248520	It's a bummer.
248520	253520	It's weird because every million people die every day, like, and horribly
253520	256520	like by machete, like, like, that are totally undeserving.
256520	259520	Like, like, like horrible, horrible, unjust deaths happen.
259520	261520	But then it's like, oh, Billy Crystal.
261520	264520	Like, like, we kind of, oh, look back on the life of a clown.
264520	267520	Uh, it's like kind of dumb because it's like, well, fuck it.
267520	268520	He died rich.
268520	269520	Billy Crystal didn't die.
269520	270520	Nobody.
270520	275520	Uh, but, but like, like, I think it's, it's just because we do, you know,
275520	280520	celebrities spend their lives kind of as an antenna and a frame drawing our
280520	281520	attention.
281520	282520	We get to talk about them.
282520	286520	If you're a celebrity that's famous for being a slut, we get to talk about
286520	287520	sluttiness.
287520	291520	Oh, that slut, that famous slut, you know, it's like a tarot card, an archetype.
291520	294520	Uh, if you're famous for being funny or you're famous for, and they tell little
294520	297520	stories, oh, this guy was famous for being rich and then he's famous for
297520	298520	being poor.
298520	299520	He's famous for fucking a dog.
299520	303520	And, uh, like, I don't know, like they're non-people, they're ghosts.
303520	305520	And then when they die, we go, oh, he died.
305520	306520	Aw.
306520	311520	That's kind of weird because we don't go, you know, uh, Lebanon is on fire.
311520	312520	Aw.
312520	313520	We don't do that.
313520	314520	It's like when Patrick Swayze died.
314520	316520	That was a, that was a bummer.
316520	317520	Oh man.
317520	318520	Holy shit.
318520	319520	Good segue, buddy.
319520	321520	From death to Roadhouse.
321520	323520	Uh, our assigned movie was, uh, Roadhouse.
323520	324520	Yeah.
324520	327520	I mean, I, I, did anybody watch Roadhouse this week?
327520	328520	Well done.
328520	330520	Well, you know my rule, Jeff, from doing a show.
330520	331520	Yeah.
331520	332520	Be nice.
332520	333520	Until...
333520	335520	It's time not to be nice.
335520	336520	Uh...
336520	337520	It's time to be not nice?
337520	338520	How do they word that?
338520	339520	It doesn't come off right.
339520	340520	Roadhouse.
340520	341520	Be, uh, be nice.
341520	342520	Until it's time...
342520	345920	Roadhouse, which I've never seen, it's one of the few, it's crazy, it's weird that it
345920	349680	slipped through my cracks, but, uh, I think the reason it did is the same reason it's
349680	350680	so fascinating.
350680	353760	There's still, there's still a couple of beevises and butt heads chuckling and slipping through
353760	354760	my cracks.
354760	357760	Get a hold of yourselves.
357760	363920	I tried, I tried to push past it.
363920	366480	You guys gotta, you guys gotta help me out.
366480	368480	The show will be three hours long.
368480	374760	Um, it, it's a, it's a show that kind of falls between the quantum definitions of, of, of
374760	377600	a lot of the things that we use to define a movie.
377600	380160	Like, is it a good movie or a bad movie?
380160	383160	Is it, is it, is it an action movie or a drama?
383160	385260	Is it, like, it's very, it's very odd.
385260	390100	The only thing you know for sure is it's a vehicle for this, this debonair, uh, young
390100	394660	starlet, uh, Patrick, uh, what's his name?
394660	395820	Swayze.
395820	396820	He's a star.
396820	402700	Uh, well, I mean, it's a very, like, one of the, his hair says starlet, but his, his,
402700	403860	his muscles say star.
403860	408460	One of the things that's very charming about it is it has this very, very kind of uplifting
408460	409820	message to it.
409820	414820	Like he's a guy that likes to be nice that he, as he says, like it's, it's also like
414900	420060	as a, as a 21st century progressive, like you have to be behind the movie because it's
420060	422020	the gayest movie you've ever seen.
422020	427220	Like, but it's kind of like dishonestly gay, I guess, because it's like sort of like saying
427220	428700	like, this is a very manly movie.
428700	430440	It's not a gay movie at all.
430440	434260	So is that a crime or is that actually a heroic movie?
434260	439700	It's kind of a motivic, like an 80s film with like top guns notoriously really fruity.
439700	440700	Yeah.
440700	442380	And then the manliest stuff back then.
442820	445460	She said like that, the, who's the woman, Kelly, what's her name?
445460	446460	Kelly Lynch.
446460	450820	Uh, was it Chris McKenna who said last night, yeah, she's a vestigial, or was it you?
450820	453620	She's a vestigial, uh, female character.
453620	454620	Yeah.
454620	455620	Yeah.
455620	457380	She's just there to like, like go through the motions.
457380	460940	It's always like even the hair and makeup people on the set of the movie were like,
460940	461940	well, whatever.
461940	463900	Like, like what are we doing here?
463900	469580	Let's talk about Patrick's Peach, uh, uh, eyes on shirt, you know, and how, how, how,
469580	471260	how tucked in it should be.
471780	477620	There is a scene when, uh, in Roadhouse, if you guys will recall, uh, when Patrick Swayze
477620	478620	is doing Tai Chi.
478620	480100	I'm sitting Tai Chi.
480100	481100	I wanted to talk about this.
481100	483100	He's certainly doing cottos or whatever.
483100	488740	And he's there along the riverbank and he's moved in on the world's best apartment in
488740	489740	a barn.
489740	494940	Uh, it's a, it's a beautiful Soho loft in a barn in Kansas.
494940	499620	So wherever they are and or Missouri, are they Missouri somewhere outside Kansas, Kansas
499620	500620	City, Missouri.
501140	502140	Yeah.
503060	508620	That river might be the Mississippi between between the barn and Bank of Zara's house
508620	510620	might be, might be the Mississippi.
511460	512700	It's a metaphorical river.
512700	516540	I mean, it's, uh, but I don't know what it's a metaphor for the river Jordan.
516580	521580	I think it's narrative ladies laziness is the old man river because he goes to buy an
521580	525020	apartment and he's driving down the road in his, in his car and he buys a shitty car
525020	528180	because he doesn't want his Benz to get fucked up because he knows his car will get fucked
528180	532460	up and he buys a shitty car and there's a wistful drive down a country lane and it's
532460	536980	just him going apartment shopping and it goes to a barn and it's this beautiful apartment
536980	542220	inside with a great big window, uh, which of course someone's going to go through because
542220	543220	it's roadhouse.
543220	544220	Right.
544220	547780	There's going to be a fire and every window must get gone through this.
547780	553500	It's fenestration at all times and, uh, across the river is Bank of Zara's mansion, which
553500	554500	is hilarious.
554500	555500	That is the weirdest thing.
555500	560300	Like, like, like he moves in and it's like, like if Luke Skywalker, like, like after
560300	564220	Mos Eisley, like they're like, like, like if Han Solo is like, well, first things first,
564220	568540	let's, let's find an apartment and they, and they got one across from the Death Star.
568540	570380	What's that moon over there?
570380	571380	That's no moon.
571380	573460	That's our neighbor.
573460	576220	You're a Death Star adjacent.
576220	579300	And so he's doing, he's doing Tai Chi and he's well oiled and it's just either sunrise
579300	581380	or sunset, but the lighting is great.
581380	587980	And then Bank of Zara goes by in an ATV and he gives him a smile like, and who's the
587980	591020	guy who's the club owner that hires Dalton at the beginning?
591020	597540	I don't know who that actor is, but we got a, yeah, John Locke's dad from lost.
597540	598540	Wow.
598540	600340	John Locke's dad from lost.
600340	601740	John Locke's dad from lost.
601740	602740	All right.
602740	607900	Cause he, he's all his, the stakes for that guy is simply, can I have muscular men around
607900	608980	me at all times?
608980	610700	He loves Patrick Swayze.
610700	612180	He even loves some of the bad guys.
612180	617180	He's so conflicted and like, I, there's so much gay energy, but, and it's not, it's,
617180	618780	it's like, it's proudly gay.
618780	621940	And yet I think, I think that any time a girl gets up on the table and starts taking her
621940	626900	shirt off, like, Hey, get out, get off the table, Patrick Swayze, Patrick Swayze, he
626900	629420	only drinks coffee and he just doesn't do drugs.
629420	634620	He doesn't drink and he, and any naked women, he just shakes his head and like, like, bad
634620	635620	business.
635620	636620	Bad business.
636620	637620	But also like, I don't think he gets it.
637620	638620	He's like naked women.
638620	639620	What?
639620	640620	What do you think of next?
640620	641620	The, the, okay.
641620	645980	But the scene that Jeff's describing, cause I, I wanted to talk about this particularly.
645980	649940	If we talk about nothing else, cause you guys are, you know, majority of the audience,
649940	654180	I want you to watch this movie and get out your little gift, gift, gift programs.
654180	660340	I want to see somebody's going to make a gift of this, an animated gif of the part of Road
660340	665160	House where Patrick Swayze is doing Tai Chi in the morning on the bank of the river that
665160	667500	lies betwixt him and the villain.
668020	672540	And then it, and then it cuts to, it's just a lot, just a lot of coverage of Patrick Swayze
672540	674100	doing Tai Chi.
674100	679460	And then the villain is out drinking like mimosas or something and it's watching him.
679460	683580	And the expressions, the expression on his face is just like, huh, yeah, I'll be done.
683580	684580	That's right.
684580	687580	When he's doing Tai Chi, he's on the veranda watching him and he's, and he's been watching
687580	691500	when they're fucking, when he's fucking Kelly Lynch, that's when he's on the ATV and he
691500	693620	sees them, he pulls up and he was watching them.
693620	694620	Fuck.
694620	695620	Right.
695620	696620	The other way around.
696740	697740	The other way around.
697740	698740	Okay.
698740	701180	So Tai Chi, he's on the ATV and when they're fucking, he's on the veranda.
701180	702180	Okay.
702180	706260	So the bad guy's doing a drive by on his four wheeler and is watching his nemesis do Tai
706260	707260	Chi.
707260	708260	One thing's for certain.
708260	711820	Anytime Patrick Swayze takes his shirt off, there's a guy regarding him.
711820	712820	Two guys in this case.
712820	718080	His, then it cuts to his landlord and it becomes like a Hee Haw sketch where his, his landlord
718080	719080	is like watching.
719080	720580	I'm going, huh, I'll be darned.
720580	722940	Like it's so weird and joyful.
722940	725180	It's a very, it's got a very joyful energy.
725180	729700	It reminds me a lot of Xanadu and that you can't, like what, what genre of movie is this?
729700	735460	All you really know is that someone somewhere along this weird pipeline was having so much
735460	740380	fun that it almost didn't get contaminated by the entire movie making process.
740380	745980	But, but of course story structure, character arcs, logic, all, all, none of that's there,
745980	749180	but the joy is still in the final cup of what you drink.
749180	754420	And I mean, cause this, this movie from the outset takes place in a world where bar bouncing
754420	763260	is a high stakes dramatic business with all kinds of codes and counter codes and like,
763260	768340	like there's, it's possible to be a sellout bouncer or a bouncer with integrity.
768340	770900	And I, I guess in that age.
770900	775300	But then we find out, we find that very subtly and very slowly that the reason why he's all
775300	778980	about being nice and playing by the rules is because he ripped a man's throat out.
778980	779980	Yeah.
779980	783100	He had killed a man by ripping his throat out and then he does it again.
783100	784100	Right.
784780	785780	He almost does it a third time.
785780	790380	He, and he does the three finger claw thing and he's going to rip another throat out.
790380	795620	There's also a dead poet society moment with shotguns.
795620	798220	It's exactly in the third act.
798220	802140	There's a moment where, where it's identical to the end of dead poets society early, instead
802140	809300	of standing on desks, people pull out shotguns and then yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a weird
809300	810300	movie.
810300	811300	It takes place in a weird world.
811300	817420	And I, I, I more than three times called out in a false set of ways, Oh, I'm going to die.
817420	819020	Which is a sign of a great movie.
819020	823300	Well, I mean, I, I, for me, for my money, I have to start with Sam Elliott because Sam
823300	829180	Elliott's hair in this is really, Sam Elliott enters the movie in like an hour into the movie
829180	831140	or 45 minutes in, he comes in late.
831140	832140	Yeah.
832140	833980	But for my money, that's when the movie begins.
833980	835140	Is Jason McCarrish here?
835140	836140	Yeah.
836140	837620	Jason, can you come up for a second?
837620	842060	Jason is a friend who came to the show tonight and he texted me.
842060	846900	That's a pretty, pretty, pretty hesitant applause.
846900	856860	Jason McCarrish, everybody, Jason is a pedophile and he wants, why did you applaud like that?
856860	858180	That's what their first round of puzzles.
858180	859180	Maybe he's a pedophile.
859180	863900	We don't know the, you, you told, you texted me right before he came to the show.
863900	866420	You said that for some reason you were on the set of Roadhouse.
866420	867420	I was, I was.
867420	869660	I just wanted to mention with the gay through line thing and you were mentioning the claw
869660	873300	and ripping out the throat and everything that the guy he's fighting with actually
873300	875540	says to him, I used to fuck guys like you in prison.
875540	876540	Yeah.
876540	877540	That's the line.
877540	878540	That's the line.
878540	879540	Who's the winner of that one?
879540	880540	That's called burying the lead.
880540	881540	Yeah.
881540	885700	Because that line happens almost on the fifth to last page.
885700	888620	But I mean, I used to fuck like guys like you in prison.
888620	892300	But honestly, it's like Pat, I kept, I was like, all right, Patrick Spacey, he's a very
892300	897340	charming guy, but he's not like, he's, I mean, I didn't remember him as being like, uh,
897900	902460	you know, like, like, like, we didn't go like, oh, that guy is, uh, I mean, and I'm not, I'm
902460	906020	not even insinuating that Patrick Spacey, the human being was, I don't, I don't care
906020	909860	if he was in or out of the closet or were around it or whatever their actors are all
909860	910860	crazy.
910860	911860	Whatever floats their boat.
911860	913740	They all fuck fish and children or whatever.
913740	915740	I mean, it's, it's an insane job.
915740	920620	They, they lie for a living to themselves and to God.
920620	921620	So the good ones are good.
921620	922620	The bad ones are bad.
922620	925820	And sometimes you find out, oh, he likes to, he likes to put his dick in a flower.
925820	926820	Who cares?
927260	930420	But, but, but I'm just saying the onscreen icon that is Patrick Swayze.
930420	935300	He was like, we just taken place because Dirty Dancing came out like right before that.
935300	938740	And we checked Ghost after we watched this because we were like, is this a thing?
938740	942540	And I watched Ghost and he was like shot very differently and acting very differently.
942540	945180	Like Roadhouse almost seemed like he specifically to get into character.
945180	948820	He kind of had a sort of sachet to him and like, like, I don't know.
948820	949820	Maybe that's the director's fault.
949820	951740	I didn't mention that because I did say I was on the set.
951740	957100	I just moved to California from Connecticut and was movie nut.
957100	960580	And it was the first time I ever saw a set and I was never been on a set before.
960580	962460	And it was the, the double deuce.
962460	963900	It was a facade, complete facade.
963900	964900	Like the front of the.
964900	965900	It's not real?
965900	966900	No.
966900	972300	You know, spoiler alert, but from behind, it's just like all boards and from the front,
972300	973620	it really looked like a place.
973620	977580	And like on like a Sunday, I was there alone and just kind of like in this glory of being
977580	980940	on a movie set and there's like a security guard who must've been hired just to stay
980940	981940	there 24.
981940	982940	So it was like, yeah, kid, get out of here.
982940	984180	You know, kick me out.
984180	987300	And then we came back another night, the whole family, like my mom, dad, sister and I, and
987300	989620	we were kind of watching them with the lights and everything.
989620	991420	And out comes Patrick Swayze.
991420	995140	And my, I remember my mother being very disappointed that he didn't look quite like he did on screen.
995140	998540	He was just kind of like hunched when their cameras weren't rolling and he had a limp
998540	1004260	because I guess he had like a horrible football injury when he was a kid or something.
1004260	1006300	And it just affected him like all through his life.
1006300	1010780	And there's a million Swayze children, all of them look vaguely like Patrick Swayze and
1010780	1015500	all of them are in Roadhouse, but not prominently on camera lest you go, what the fuck's going
1015500	1016500	on?
1016500	1017500	Because they all look a lot like Patrick Swayze.
1017500	1018500	Are they really?
1018500	1019500	Yeah.
1019500	1020500	I thought we were joking about that.
1020500	1021500	No, no, no.
1021500	1023180	There's Patrick Swayze's got a handful of brothers.
1023180	1027260	There's five people in that movie that looked like kind of like fetal alcohol syndrome Swayze's.
1027260	1031500	One of them could be his actual brother who shows up every once in a while and you're
1031500	1035100	like, oh wait, that's not Patrick Swayze, but it looks just very much like him.
1035100	1036100	Yeah.
1036420	1042180	Patrick Swayze's mom choreographed the production of Sweet Charity that I was in in Simi Valley
1042180	1043180	Community Theater.
1043180	1045940	She taught me to dance.
1045940	1049700	Do you remember any lyrics from one of your songs?
1049700	1056780	Here is a man with no dream and no plan till one something night I found Sweet Charity.
1056780	1061700	Oh, what you've done to me.
1061700	1062700	Forget I asked.
1062700	1063700	Forget I asked.
1064700	1068260	When did comp trolling change?
1068260	1069260	It became about sabotage.
1069260	1071380	I thought you were really interested.
1071380	1078020	I thought you would commit to it at least.
1078020	1079020	Thanks for coming up Jason.
1079020	1080020	I'll excuse myself.
1080020	1081820	So you would say you were on the set.
1081820	1083060	You just mean you actually like.
1083060	1086740	I was there watching them shoot and they came up and were looking for extras and they kind
1086740	1088700	of pointed at my mother and said, hey, come here.
1088700	1090060	And she just didn't think it was her.
1090060	1092900	So she had her chance to be in the movie and blew it.
1093900	1094900	Sorry, mom.
1094900	1095900	Where was that shot?
1095900	1096900	Valencia.
1096900	1097900	Valencia.
1097900	1098900	Oh, no shit?
1098900	1099900	Yeah.
1099900	1100900	All right.
1100900	1101900	Jason McCarras, ladies and gentlemen.
1101900	1102900	Thank you.
1102900	1103900	All right.
1105900	1106900	Roadhouse.
1107900	1108900	I'm sorry, Dan.
1108900	1110900	I didn't mean to shut you down about that.
1110900	1111900	No, it's okay, man.
1111900	1112900	Just keep the show moving.
1112900	1114900	That's your job, you know?
1114900	1115900	Just keep me feeling good.
1115900	1117900	Keep my confidence up.
1117900	1119900	So that's comp trolling.
1119900	1123900	What about the scene when Sam Elliott starts dancing?
1123900	1125900	They're out all night long and they go to a diner.
1125900	1127900	He's dancing with Patrick Swayze's date?
1127900	1128900	Yeah.
1128900	1129900	His girlfriend?
1129900	1130900	And he's got his hand around her neck.
1130900	1131900	And he just keeps it.
1131900	1132900	Yeah.
1132900	1133900	Like it's rampant, cock blocking.
1133900	1135900	Like it's just an all out assault.
1135900	1136900	He's just like whispering in her ear.
1136900	1138900	And he says things to Patrick Swayze.
1138900	1139900	He's like, boy, I was her wish.
1139900	1143900	And if she wasn't fucking you, I'd try everything I could to get her to fuck me.
1143900	1148900	That girl's got far entirely too many brains to have an ass like that.
1150900	1153900	It's pretty weird that he's a good guy.
1153900	1155900	It's odd.
1155900	1158900	I see from Twitter that I think Spencer's drunk tonight.
1158900	1159900	What?
1159900	1161900	I feel like he was tweeting.
1161900	1162900	Spencer doesn't drink, does he?
1162900	1163900	Yeah, not usually.
1163900	1166900	So let's break Spencer up and see what's going on.
1166900	1180900	Quickly before the applause ends.
1180900	1183900	Spencer, have you been drinking?
1183900	1184900	No.
1184900	1185900	Yeah.
1185900	1186900	Yeah.
1186900	1187900	Yes.
1187900	1188900	I have.
1188900	1189900	Wait.
1189900	1191900	I thought you were a tea toddler.
1191900	1192900	What?
1192900	1194900	I thought you didn't drink.
1194900	1195900	I don't?
1195900	1196900	Did you not?
1196900	1197900	I did.
1197900	1198900	You did?
1198900	1199900	Yeah.
1199900	1200900	Who's on first?
1200900	1201900	Acurine.
1201900	1204900	End of bit.
1211900	1212900	We've been through this.
1212900	1213900	He chooses not to drink.
1213900	1214900	He knows how.
1214900	1215900	Yeah, exactly.
1215900	1216900	Yeah, I know how.
1216900	1218900	It's not like he's incapable of doing it.
1218900	1222900	Because on the tour bus, on the Harman Town tour, you didn't really drink a whole lot.
1222900	1223900	I had a shot or two, yeah.
1224900	1226900	But mostly it was Diet Coke, so it was Mountain Dew's for you.
1226900	1227900	Yeah, yeah.
1227900	1230900	I love high-fructose corn syrup.
1230900	1233900	So what did you have to drink tonight, Spencer?
1233900	1240900	I had three PBR tall boys, courtesy of Pikey.
1240900	1241900	The Pikey.
1242900	1243900	Three tall boys.
1243900	1244900	Is that a lot?
1244900	1245900	That's not a lot of beer, right?
1245900	1247900	Tall boys are 16-ounce, right?
1247900	1248900	Yeah, 16.
1248900	1249900	Something happened out front, right?
1249900	1250900	Erin said she pulled up in a cab.
1250900	1251900	Oh, my God.
1251900	1252900	Yeah.
1252900	1254900	Well, she should tell her, right?
1254900	1256900	I mean, she almost died.
1257900	1258900	Sure, I don't know.
1258900	1259900	It's not funny?
1259900	1261900	I guess it's kind of funny.
1261900	1264900	All right, let's bring Erin out and have her...
1264900	1266900	Sorry, I don't mean to sandbag you guys.
1266900	1267900	No, no, it's okay.
1267900	1269900	Erin McGathey, tell the almost-died story.
1276900	1278900	I don't know if I almost died.
1278900	1280900	Oh, you almost died.
1281900	1283900	Spencer, you're drunk.
1284900	1286900	I took a cab.
1286900	1288900	Look at that smile.
1288900	1289900	Look at this guy.
1289900	1291900	I've never seen you smile like this.
1291900	1293900	I've never been happy.
1300900	1304900	See, that's what happened to me, but I was like 13.
1304900	1305900	Yeah, yeah.
1305900	1307900	I did a lot of things out of order.
1307900	1308900	Yeah.
1308900	1310900	Yeah, life is like a bingo card.
1310900	1312900	Like, everybody learns different things at different times.
1312900	1313900	It's great.
1313900	1317900	Spencer's finally learning that alcohol takes the pain away.
1318900	1320900	It's good that you didn't learn it as a child.
1320900	1322900	You'd be like me.
1322900	1323900	Did you drive here, Spencer?
1323900	1324900	You live quite a ways away.
1324900	1326900	Yeah, yeah, I drove here.
1326900	1328900	So, yeah, you'll be sober by the end of the show.
1328900	1330900	Well, I hope, yeah.
1330900	1335900	I mean, I haven't done any experimental testing on the subject, but I'd assume...
1335900	1337900	God, he's so drunk.
1338900	1340900	I'm tore up, you guys.
1341900	1344900	And it kind of looks like he's going through fake prop folders right now.
1346900	1347900	Hey, all right.
1347900	1348900	Tell this cab story.
1348900	1354900	So, speaking of drinking and driving, I took a cab here, as I usually do, on Monday nights,
1354900	1356900	because we drink during the show and I don't want to drive.
1356900	1358900	And my cab driver...
1358900	1359900	Thanks, guys.
1362900	1367900	And my cab driver went through Independent Taxi, which is normally a great company.
1367900	1369900	I guess we shouldn't say that even in the company, whatever.
1369900	1374900	My cab driver wouldn't stop when we got to Sunset and Gardiner, which is where...
1374900	1376900	Because he's independent.
1376900	1377900	Yeah.
1377900	1379900	He's like, what are you, fucking, mainstream?
1379900	1382900	I'll stop it for you, corporate bitch.
1382900	1384900	Indie cab company.
1384900	1388900	So, he wouldn't stop and I kept on saying, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
1388900	1394900	And he kept on going and dropped me off up by the pikey, where Spencer was standing.
1394900	1395900	I was like, oh, my friend's there.
1395900	1396900	Please stop, please stop.
1396900	1398900	Like, as if that made him stop.
1398900	1400900	He was like, well, she has a friend.
1400900	1401900	I'll stop the cab here.
1401900	1402900	Now you're affecting lives.
1402900	1404900	You're affecting relationships.
1404900	1405900	Stop.
1405900	1407900	So, he stopped the car.
1407900	1408900	I ran across the street.
1408900	1413900	I showed Spencer my cake and then my cab driver immediately made a U-turn
1413900	1417900	and got T-boned by a car in the intersection.
1417900	1419900	And Spencer was like, you couldn't die.
1419900	1420900	No, well, think about it this way.
1420900	1422900	Oh, stop, stop, stop.
1422900	1425900	No, how about you just turn around and take me back dead?
1425900	1426900	Yeah.
1426900	1427900	It's funny.
1427900	1431900	Like, I almost, I was going to have him turn around and I was like, no, that's fine.
1431900	1433900	I'll just, I mean, if you wouldn't have been standing there.
1433900	1436900	Spencer, your alcoholism saved the day.
1436900	1438900	You may have saved my life because I was like, oh, there's Spencer.
1438900	1442900	I'll walk back with him instead of having that driver pull back around.
1442900	1443900	It was pretty weird.
1443900	1444900	Yeah.
1444900	1445900	Okay.
1445900	1448900	Before we bring up, actually, I want to bring up Kumail because maybe he might have something
1448900	1449900	to say about this.
1449900	1453900	So, let's bring out Kumail Nanjiani.
1453900	1460900	I don't know if Kumail has, I don't know.
1460900	1463900	I want to talk about Skeletor.
1463900	1464900	Oh, yeah.
1464900	1465900	From the He-Man universe.
1465900	1469900	I've got opinions.
1469900	1475900	Skeletor, I'm researching.
1475900	1478900	Because I always thought this was the case when I was a kid.
1478900	1481900	I would watch it as a rerun or whatever after school.
1481900	1484900	It would be like between Inspector Gadget and Mork and Mindy or something like that.
1484900	1490900	And I always thought this was the case, but as a 40-year-old, I recently looked back into this.
1490900	1493900	Skeletor from the He-Man universe.
1493900	1494900	Antagonist.
1494900	1497900	The antagonist, the Darth Vader of the He-Man universe.
1497900	1500900	He-Man, for those of you who don't know, was the alter ego of...
1500900	1501900	Prince Adam.
1501900	1505900	Of an identical man with a shirt on named Prince Adam.
1505900	1510900	Who also had a very idiosyncratic looking, they had the same animal also.
1510900	1515900	I mean, as if having the same head and body wasn't recognizable enough.
1515900	1517900	He also accompanied the same color...
1517900	1521900	There's only one giant green cat in this kingdom.
1521900	1528900	Skeletor was the Darth Vader to this character of this universe, Eternia, I think was the name of the world.
1528900	1534900	I always remember Skeletor lived in a place called Snake Mountain.
1534900	1535900	That's correct.
1535900	1541900	He was obsessed with beating He-Man and He-Man's mentor or, you know...
1541900	1542900	The sorceress.
1542900	1546900	His Athena, the sorceress, who had eagle hair and a beak head or something.
1546900	1550900	And she lived in a place called Castle Grayskull.
1550900	1551900	That's correct.
1551900	1559900	And Skeletor was always going on and on about how he wanted to be in Castle Grayskull, which seemed appropriate.
1559900	1560900	And I looked it up...
1560900	1562900	Because Snake Mountain sounds like a terrible place.
1562900	1566900	Like, don't buy a house at Snake Mountain.
1566900	1572900	Skeletor used to live in Castle Grayskull, according to the mythology of the...
1572900	1575900	Wait, he couldn't pay the rent? What happened?
1575900	1578900	He got, like, evicted. He got, like...
1578900	1580900	He got evicted from Castle Grayskull.
1580900	1583900	You're saying this is the origin story.
1583900	1585900	He didn't get, like, a slip on his door.
1585900	1587900	You have to pay the rent, but I can't pay the rent.
1587900	1590900	He used to live in Castle Grayskull.
1590900	1593900	Yeah. I didn't... I guess I didn't know that.
1593900	1595900	Speaking of, like...
1595900	1597900	It's his rightful home.
1597900	1600900	Oh, he used to live there. He didn't live there with him. He lived there on his own.
1600900	1605900	It was his place. It's a skull. It makes sense. He lived in a skull.
1605900	1610900	He would drive up and he probably left the door unlocked because he figured, who would steal this from me?
1610900	1612900	This is some Israel-Palestine shit.
1612900	1616900	Yeah! You said it, not me.
1616900	1617900	Fucking A, right?
1617900	1620900	I didn't want to say it, you know, and have you jump on me.
1620900	1622900	No, no, no. I would have agreed.
1622900	1624900	This is some shit that blew my mind.
1624900	1626900	Here's the other thing that blows my mind.
1626900	1629900	Who used to live in Snake Mountain?
1629900	1635900	I mean, there's some snake guy living in a honeycomb just placing the B or...
1635900	1640900	Buzz Off was his name. His name was Buzz Off. That was a giant B person.
1640900	1644900	How far down what size hill does this shit roll?
1645900	1648900	Also, the big problem I have with it is...
1648900	1654900	Okay, so if there's a whole race of people who are like Skeletor, why is his name Skeletor?
1654900	1656900	Well, I don't know that there's a race of people.
1656900	1662900	Well, there was one race of all people who had like mosquito faces, but you only knew one and his name was Mosquitor.
1662900	1666900	Are all the others just like Ed and Jared and stuff like that?
1666900	1668900	Did you meet all the mosquito people in the streets?
1668900	1677900	You see him once, it's me and it's all these people and they all have mosquito faces and he's like, I'm Mosquitor, that's Gerald.
1677900	1681900	So the naming always threw me off, even as a little kid.
1681900	1683900	Well, there's people named Manfred.
1683900	1685900	Like Man and Fred.
1685900	1689900	Well, his name is He Man. That's the most redundant name ever.
1689900	1691900	Yeah.
1691900	1695900	He Man really falls apart if you really look at it.
1696900	1698900	Poor Skeletor.
1698900	1707900	I was looking, I was browsing around and I saw like a Skeletor package that was Skeletor scuba gear.
1707900	1711900	Like you could buy a special Skeletor that had like a scuba pack.
1711900	1716900	And I just thought that was so, it made me realize like all those years, Skeletor was the good guy.
1716900	1724900	This guy is like, he's like going like, I've got to get He Man, I'm going to go through the water and ruin his fishing trip.
1724900	1728900	You know, there was a fish man, there was like a merman or something that probably, I can do that.
1728900	1730900	And he's like, you know what, I got this.
1730900	1732900	Like that's a good villain.
1732900	1735900	His name was Merman. That was a guy named Merman.
1735900	1737900	You're like amazing at this.
1737900	1738900	Thank you.
1738900	1740900	What about, was Ram Man in there?
1740900	1743900	Ram Man was in there. He was a porn star.
1743900	1745900	I had the Ram Man toy.
1745900	1747900	His legs would go up.
1747900	1748900	He was a good guy, right?
1748900	1750900	Ram Man was a good guy.
1750900	1752900	Was it Battle Cat and Cringer?
1752900	1755900	Cringer was the, yeah.
1755900	1759900	I know everything about He Man except for the eviction backstory.
1759900	1760900	How old are you?
1760900	1761900	I'm 33.
1761900	1762900	33.
1762900	1765900	And you were two, you almost watched the cartoons?
1765900	1766900	I watched the cartoons.
1766900	1772900	That was the biggest, like most like disillusioning thing was last year I found DVDs for like $3.
1772900	1774900	I was like, oh my God, this cartoon.
1774900	1781900	So I watched it and I was like, oh, I must have been a dumb shit as a kid because it's so bad.
1781900	1785900	That cartoon, like some stuff holds up, but that one, they use the same animation.
1785900	1786900	Yeah, it's really incomplete.
1786900	1793900	He Man always walks like right to left and he like bounces up and down and they like work that in to like every episode.
1793900	1795900	Yeah, well, because it was such expensive looking animation.
1795900	1796900	It looked almost rotoscopes.
1796900	1801900	Like he would always, and then he would fight his evil twin and they would just show, they would just flip the image.
1802900	1803900	Well, it's also funny.
1803900	1805900	He had an evil twin that made a robot cyborg.
1805900	1806900	His name was Fakor.
1806900	1807900	Fakor.
1807900	1808900	Yeah.
1808900	1809900	Worst name ever.
1809900	1812900	Who looked just like He Man, except he was blue with orange hair.
1812900	1813900	Yeah.
1813900	1815900	Like you're not fooling anyone.
1815900	1818900	Except in a world where Prince Adam is Clark Kent.
1818900	1819900	Yeah.
1819900	1823900	Maybe everyone in the universe is like weird, has a weird.
1823900	1824900	They all have that.
1824900	1825900	Projopagnosia.
1825900	1826900	Yeah, exactly.
1826900	1835900	Because like if you're going through the trouble of making a fucking android to replace the main guy, make him the same hue as the main guy.
1835900	1838900	Even his hair was a different color.
1838900	1839900	So many missteps.
1839900	1841900	What was, what was Skeletor's mission?
1841900	1843900	To get his home back.
1843900	1845900	And it makes me cry.
1845900	1846900	Really?
1846900	1848900	Yeah, he wanted his home back.
1848900	1849900	He wasn't the villain.
1849900	1851900	It was the power of Greyskull, right?
1851900	1852900	His home.
1852900	1853900	The power of having a home.
1853900	1854900	But that's what they called it.
1854900	1857900	It's like he wanted the power of Greyskull, but he just wanted his house back.
1857900	1858900	His house back.
1858900	1860900	The power of home.
1860900	1867900	Well, he wanted to rule all of Eternia also, which is a little, which I'm like, I wanted to see the series where he wins and he rules Eternia.
1867900	1870900	But then it's just him like doing paperwork and taxes.
1870900	1872900	This is not as easy.
1872900	1874900	So what was He Man's role in this universe?
1874900	1877900	Like he was there to keep Skeletor out of his home?
1877900	1879900	He's half human, half Eternian.
1879900	1889900	And that is bestiality, because his mom is Earthling and his dad is Eternian, which is bestiality.
1889900	1891900	Which is also what Superman and Lois Lane is.
1891900	1892900	That's bestiality.
1892900	1893900	What do you mean, bestiality?
1893900	1894900	They're different species.
1894900	1895900	Why are they fucking?
1895900	1897900	Well, different species are beasts.
1897900	1903900	No, but that's what other two species have sex and we're like, all right, that's fine.
1903900	1906900	A giraffe and an otter.
1906900	1908900	That's the only example.
1908900	1912900	No, but I mean, if sentient species, like...
1912900	1916900	Is it bestiality if a horse fucks like a donkey?
1916900	1918900	Yes.
1918900	1922900	Well, actually, a horse is fucking horse is bestiality.
1922900	1925900	As long as one beast is involved.
1925900	1927900	Exactly.
1927900	1929900	Wow.
1929900	1931900	We've learned a lot.
1931900	1934900	Do you guys know He Man?
1935900	1940900	It's pretty easy to catch up if you just do a cursory Googling.
1940900	1943900	There were a whole race of snake people in there.
1943900	1945900	And I bet they used to live in Snake Mountain.
1945900	1947900	Yeah, because they don't always get along with Skeletor.
1947900	1949900	So I bet that's what it was.
1949900	1951900	It's gotta be it.
1951900	1952900	Shit.
1952900	1955900	Are you saying Skeletor is like the Palestinians?
1955900	1961900	Well, I mean, I'm not saying...
1961900	1965900	I'm saying he was displaced from a place he previously occupied.
1965900	1969900	And, I mean, is it politically controversial?
1969900	1972900	Baby, tell him what you were saying in the car.
1972900	1973900	I'm slamming the steering wheel.
1973900	1975900	It's just like the Palestinians.
1975900	1979900	I mean, I guess they share that.
1979900	1980900	Yeah.
1980900	1982900	I'm saying I feel bad for Skeletor.
1982900	1984900	Okay, that's what I'm saying.
1984900	1987900	He just looks like a bad guy, and that was his only mistake.
1987900	1989900	He's also speaking of gay.
1989900	1992900	He's straight up gay on that show.
1992900	1994900	Skeletor is a gay man.
1994900	1995900	How do you mean?
1995900	1997900	Well, I mean, not to be...
1997900	2000900	The way he literally, first of all, dresses like a gay man
2000900	2004900	who's just learned to be gay from the internet or something.
2004900	2006900	So does He-Man, by the way.
2006900	2007900	Well, He-Man is straight up...
2007900	2008900	Everybody on that show.
2008900	2012900	With like a fur underwear and leather halter top.
2012900	2016900	He's always surrounding himself by boners with boners.
2016900	2017900	All right.
2017900	2018900	Does he look like...
2021900	2022900	No, no.
2022900	2023900	I'm going to stick with this.
2023900	2024900	I'm going to stick with this.
2024900	2025900	He looks like a skeleton, right?
2025900	2026900	With a hood?
2026900	2028900	He's got a skull for a head, yeah.
2028900	2031900	Yeah, but he's like a skeleton who works out
2031900	2032900	because he's super buff.
2032900	2033900	What are his powers?
2033900	2034900	Is he just strong?
2034900	2036900	He has like a stick that...
2036900	2037900	He has a staff.
2037900	2038900	Glows.
2038900	2039900	What?
2039900	2040900	Yeah, it's pretty gay.
2040900	2041900	That surprises people?
2041900	2042900	Are there powers?
2042900	2044900	Yeah, it's a magic stick.
2044900	2045900	Also known as a wand.
2045900	2046900	It's bigger than a wand.
2046900	2047900	It's a staff.
2047900	2048900	He's got a staff.
2050900	2051900	Spencer, you all right?
2051900	2052900	Yeah, yeah.
2052900	2054900	No, you know he has a scuba equipment.
2054900	2056900	Yeah, a skeleton.
2056900	2057900	Strong Spencer.
2057900	2058900	They always...
2058900	2061900	They did that to sell more.
2061900	2064900	They would just have more like mountain climbing He-Man
2064900	2065900	and shit like that.
2065900	2066900	They did that with Superman.
2066900	2069900	Like Superman used to be able to like be in space
2069900	2070900	and then for a while he couldn't
2070900	2072900	so they could sell like the Superman space outfit.
2072900	2075900	What happened in the last Dungeons and Dragons game?
2075900	2078900	You went to the Shadow Plane.
2078900	2080900	And we got the Soul of Growth.
2080900	2083900	Oh yeah, I think you got that episode before though.
2083900	2085900	But yeah, you got the Soul of Growth.
2085900	2089900	Our shadows detached, ran off and a dark...
2089900	2090900	Wait, what?
2090900	2092900	I wasn't here last week.
2092900	2094900	Robin Williams was here.
2094900	2096900	Fuck you.
2096900	2098900	There is no way.
2098900	2100900	It feels like this is like a dream you had.
2100900	2105900	All my shadow ran away and Robin Williams was there.
2105900	2106900	It's true.
2106900	2108900	I saw pictures.
2108900	2109900	I was very upset.
2109900	2110900	Yeah.
2110900	2112900	So our shadows were detached
2112900	2116900	and we were on a dark shadowy plane
2116900	2119900	where a dark version of Coco the horse came up to us
2119900	2122900	and Aaron was riding on...
2122900	2123900	What's your name?
2123900	2125900	Mulrain was riding on the horse.
2125900	2127900	Is the horse... was it a shadow?
2127900	2129900	Shadow version of Coco.
2129900	2131900	But 3D?
2131900	2132900	Or is it on the floor?
2132900	2133900	3D.
2133900	2135900	Let's just let drunk Spencer tell us.
2135900	2138900	Yeah, guys.
2138900	2140900	Spencer, stop trying to eat the dice.
2140900	2141900	What?
2141900	2142900	For the listeners at home, guys.
2142900	2143900	For the listeners at home.
2143900	2147900	They're colorful.
2147900	2148900	All right, Spencer.
2148900	2150900	I really hope you sober up tonight.
2150900	2151900	I think we all...
2151900	2153900	This could be a tragic ending.
2153900	2155900	He just kills us off because he's drunk.
2155900	2157900	Last time on Harmon Town.
2157900	2159900	Our heroes were divvying up
2159900	2162900	the treasure hoard of Giantis, the green dragon.
2162900	2167900	A task that by all means should have taken no longer than a single session.
2167900	2169900	After coming across the goggles of night,
2169900	2173900	Christa Berg, the rogue, put them on granting him dark vision.
2173900	2175900	With his newly enchanted eyes,
2175900	2177900	the rogue found a portal to another plane
2177900	2180900	deep within the dragon's mystical crack.
2180900	2182900	After some discussion,
2182900	2184900	the heroes plunged through the portal
2184900	2186900	and found themselves in a hazy dark place.
2186900	2188900	The Shadow Plane.
2188900	2191900	Just then, a mysterious dark sun appeared
2191900	2194900	and animated the shadows of Sharpie, Quark, Mulrin, and Christa Berg.
2194900	2197900	The shadows, newly awakened, freed themselves
2197900	2201900	and danced off towards a thicket of ashy black columns.
2201900	2202900	Having lost their shadows,
2202900	2206900	the group was considerably weakened.
2206900	2210900	And lost, having just been transported to yet another plane.
2210900	2214900	But just then, the gang was approached by a large, swift, shadowy horse beast.
2214900	2216900	Though silent and slightly off,
2216900	2219900	Mulrin could tell the beast was somehow linked to her companion, Kogo,
2219900	2221900	who was last seen on the plane of Twyla.
2221900	2223900	After mounting the shadow creature
2223900	2226900	and planting a flag of sadness into the ground,
2226900	2228900	the gang pressed onward,
2228900	2230900	into the stand of Ebon Pillars,
2230900	2233900	hoping to regain their shadows and find their way.
2233900	2236900	But would they truly find what they were looking for
2236900	2239900	in the thicket of Ebon Pillars?
2239900	2242900	Drug Spencer!
2242900	2244900	You still got it.
2244900	2246900	God damn it.
2246900	2249900	What is the flag of sadness?
2249900	2251900	I was listening to Harmontown today,
2251900	2254900	and at some point before you guys departed,
2254900	2256900	Sharpie was like,
2256900	2261900	I saw a blue flag made out of my sadness.
2261900	2262900	I saw that?
2262900	2263900	Yeah, yeah.
2263900	2264900	It's perfect that it's blue.
2264900	2265900	And I planted it into the ground.
2265900	2267900	That's a good color for sadness.
2267900	2269900	The reason you did it was to mark where you had been
2269900	2272900	in case you, you know, got lost or were going in circles.
2272900	2273900	Oh.
2273900	2275900	It was pretty brilliant.
2275900	2278900	All right, so now we're marching off towards the dark columns, right?
2278900	2280900	Towards the dark columns.
2280900	2281900	I can see.
2281900	2283900	Yeah, so our shadows...
2283900	2284900	Are gone.
2284900	2285900	Christoper, yeah, are gone.
2285900	2286900	We're gonna go regain.
2286900	2287900	I don't ever use my shadows.
2287900	2288900	I'm cool with that.
2288900	2291900	Well, you know, it turns out we took a lot of vitality points, right,
2291900	2292900	or what sort of points?
2292900	2293900	Yeah, that's true.
2293900	2295900	You guys took some ability damage.
2295900	2300900	You're weakened, and you feel kind of more ill and sickly, as it were.
2300900	2303900	So I just feel kind of shitty because of my shadow, by the way.
2303900	2306900	In game terms, you have minus one strength and minus four constipation.
2306900	2308900	So it's kind of like being hungover.
2308900	2309900	It's like being poisoned.
2309900	2311900	You'll find out tomorrow.
2313900	2314900	All right, so how far...
2314900	2315900	Drink Gatorade.
2315900	2316900	It's a lie.
2316900	2318900	No, it's bacon sandwiches.
2318900	2319900	The British...
2319900	2321900	Don't drink bacon sandwiches either.
2321900	2322900	That is the traditional...
2322900	2324900	The British scientist people, that's what they're called.
2324900	2329900	They commissioned a study that actually linked bacon sandwiches
2329900	2331900	to ending hangovers.
2331900	2332900	And eggs.
2332900	2333900	And eggs.
2333900	2335900	But you know fastest hangover cure of all?
2335900	2336900	Suicide.
2336900	2337900	Sailing drip.
2337900	2338900	Oh.
2338900	2340900	Medical students give each other...
2340900	2344900	You'd have to be a real loser to have, like, a sailing drip at your house.
2344900	2346900	They're real professionals.
2346900	2352900	I just found out they have vans in Las Vegas where you can get in,
2352900	2355900	and they hook you up to an IV, and you can continue gambling
2355900	2357900	while they're IV sailing into you.
2357900	2360900	And it kills your hangover in, like, ten seconds.
2360900	2361900	Wow.
2361900	2362900	That's bad luck.
2362900	2365900	The van is called a wake-up call.
2365900	2368900	I said that to somebody and their immediate question was,
2368900	2370900	you mean, like, video gambling, right?
2370900	2371900	And I realized for the first time,
2371900	2374900	like, the alternative would be that there's a Blackjack dealer in there.
2375900	2376900	That was me.
2376900	2377900	I said that.
2377900	2378900	That is good.
2379900	2380900	Spencer's got it.
2380900	2381900	I was there, you guys.
2381900	2383900	All right, so how far off are these columns, Spencer?
2383900	2385900	You guys are approaching them.
2385900	2389900	Soon you'll be inside of this entanglement of columns.
2389900	2391900	Okay, so we walk up to the entanglement of columns.
2391900	2392900	Yeah, you do.
2392900	2393900	Stick with me, guys.
2393900	2394900	I can see.
2394900	2397900	The floor is ashen gray, and the pitch-black columns
2397900	2399900	jut out of the ground into the sky.
2399900	2402900	They're gnarled in clawed branches grabbing at the black sky above.
2402900	2404900	You can hear an ethereal wind blowing,
2404900	2407900	and far-off whispery voices creep into your ears,
2407900	2410900	telling of misery and madness and languages unknown.
2411900	2412900	Fuck.
2413900	2415900	So they can't see it, so I'll describe.
2415900	2417900	The columns are, like, intertwined.
2417900	2419900	It looks like they're almost grasping at the sky.
2419900	2421900	Yeah, right.
2421900	2423900	So you can, Jeff can kind of see them.
2423900	2425900	You can kind of see them, right?
2425900	2426900	Back me up, bro.
2426900	2428900	Yeah, you guys are really not seeing much.
2428900	2429900	He's pretty much right.
2429900	2431900	It looks like they're grasping at the sky.
2431900	2433900	Yeah, I pretend that I can totally see them.
2434900	2436900	Who the fuck do you think...
2436900	2437900	Yeah, I know.
2437900	2438900	Are they grasping at the...
2438900	2439900	How many fingers are there?
2439900	2440900	What do you mean?
2440900	2441900	They're columns.
2441900	2442900	How many columns?
2442900	2443900	How many are there?
2443900	2445900	Sharpie's bluff falls through.
2446900	2448900	I guess.
2448900	2450900	Um, okay, guess.
2450900	2451900	Five.
2451900	2452900	Well, you rolled to see if it's...
2452900	2453900	Oh.
2453900	2456900	No, I mean, he guessed correctly in terms of convincing...
2456900	2458900	All right, you guessed correctly,
2458900	2461900	but it was clearly still a guess.
2462900	2464900	The way you threw up your hand was...
2464900	2466900	No dice for roll.
2467900	2468900	All right, so these columns...
2468900	2470900	Can I go examine the columns?
2470900	2471900	Yeah, you can.
2471900	2473900	I examine the columns.
2473900	2474900	I'll go examine the columns.
2474900	2476900	Their surface is smooth and black.
2476900	2479900	Um, yeah, that's what they look like.
2480900	2483900	They seem rather straight, stretching high into the sky,
2483900	2487900	and as noted before, they have narrow branches.
2488900	2490900	Narrow branches, so we could climb these things.
2490900	2491900	Yeah, definitely.
2491900	2492900	You're a big climber, huh?
2492900	2493900	I love to climb.
2493900	2494900	Do you want to climb?
2495900	2497900	I love climbing columns.
2498900	2500900	You hear a soft squish.
2500900	2501900	Squish, squish, squish.
2501900	2502900	Oh.
2502900	2504900	Oh, shit.
2505900	2506900	Is it approaching us?
2506900	2507900	Who knows, man?
2507900	2509900	I cast light.
2510900	2511900	Yeah, you do.
2511900	2514900	Your light has an incredibly diminished effect.
2514900	2516900	You can only see about ten feet ahead of you.
2516900	2518900	You don't make anything out.
2520900	2521900	Squish, squish, squish.
2521900	2522900	Oh, God.
2523900	2524900	All right.
2524900	2526900	Do I have a torch?
2526900	2527900	Yeah, you do.
2527900	2528900	I don't think it's going to work.
2528900	2530900	I think the light shit isn't working.
2530900	2531900	But if I...
2532900	2533900	All right.
2533900	2535900	I mean, like I said before, it would work better than nothing.
2535900	2537900	I was going to attach a torch to an arrow
2537900	2538900	and then shoot it towards the squishes,
2538900	2540900	but I guess that's a bad idea.
2540900	2541900	It's not a terrible idea.
2541900	2542900	No, don't attack.
2542900	2544900	Well, I don't want to attack.
2544900	2545900	Don't attack the squishies.
2545900	2548900	I've been living in regret ever since we fought that dragon.
2548900	2550900	Remember that dragon came out and said,
2550900	2554900	there's just borsals, and you just fucking started firing at it.
2554900	2555900	You don't know.
2555900	2557900	Like, some dragons will be like, hey, my name is Ralph.
2557900	2559900	Like, let me hang out with you.
2559900	2562900	Well, I challenge you to be so good at archery
2562900	2564900	and not attack everything that you've seen.
2564900	2566900	You know, like almost most of the encounters
2566900	2568900	you guys have had so far have actually had
2568900	2571900	non-combat resolutions that were possible.
2572900	2574900	Well, there's no way we would know that.
2574900	2575900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2575900	2576900	Why are you telling us this now?
2576900	2579900	Because I guess, I guess that that's the case.
2579900	2582900	Well, we disagree and consensus is you're wrong.
2582900	2584900	I have a good feeling about that fucking dragon.
2584900	2585900	I think you're wrong.
2585900	2587900	I think he would be our best friend right now.
2587900	2590900	You were lucky with the five columns, but this is too much.
2590900	2593900	I start climbing up one of the columns.
2593900	2594900	It's my turn.
2594900	2604900	On Coco, I approach the noise.
2604900	2606900	And it says I have low light vision.
2606900	2607900	You do.
2607900	2608900	Oh, right, because you're a half-elf.
2608900	2609900	I think you're a human or something.
2609900	2611900	You are always forgetting I'm half-elf.
2611900	2613900	That has never been said.
2613900	2614900	I don't see race.
2617900	2618900	Nice, cool dudes.
2620900	2622900	So I approach.
2623900	2624900	You don't see anything.
2624900	2625900	I don't think that's a good idea.
2625900	2627900	You can hear the squishing, but you can't see a thing.
2627900	2630900	In fact, you have the best vision, Christa Berg,
2630900	2632900	and you can't see anything making it.
2632900	2634900	You can still hear it.
2634900	2636900	It sounds maybe like it's going around,
2637900	2639900	like a circle or circling around us.
2639900	2640900	Like you can't tell it's a circle,
2640900	2643900	but definitely different places around you.
2643900	2644900	Uh-oh.
2644900	2645900	Yeah, yeah.
2645900	2648900	I start climbing up one of the columns as high as I can go.
2648900	2649900	You climb it.
2649900	2652900	It feels firm and kind of springy underneath your grasp.
2652900	2653900	It's not cold.
2653900	2654900	Kind of like a cock.
2656900	2659900	Once you go giant black ethereal column.
2660900	2664900	You never go white giant ethereal column.
2664900	2667900	Placing your fingers around this stiff rigid object.
2669900	2672900	No, you climb up, you climb up the black, the black pillar
2672900	2674900	and you can actually, they're all black, you know,
2674900	2677900	it's all black pillars, but you can see there's something pretty
2677900	2679900	far off that looks like it's not black.
2679900	2681900	It's like a tuft of color.
2681900	2682900	Up to the top?
2682900	2683900	Yeah.
2683900	2686900	On the top of a far off pillar that he could see from his van.
2686900	2689900	So I'm on the wrong pillar, but I can see from this column that I
2689900	2691900	can see another one that has a different hue.
2691900	2692900	Yeah, yeah.
2692900	2694900	I mean wrongs all relative, but yeah.
2695900	2696900	Gotcha.
2696900	2699900	In this case, I would say wrong is the right word to use.
2699900	2702900	What if it was like a trap and then it would be the right pillar?
2702900	2704900	Maybe you're on one of the four right pillars.
2704900	2705900	It's not a trap.
2705900	2706900	So how far up am I right now?
2706900	2707900	You're about 30 feet up.
2707900	2708900	Okay.
2708900	2709900	Yeah.
2709900	2710900	I stay there.
2710900	2711900	Okay.
2712900	2713900	He conceals his knowledge.
2713900	2714900	Does he tell us?
2714900	2715900	He doesn't sound like it.
2715900	2719900	No, I pass on when I see to everybody else around me.
2719900	2721900	Can I try and climb up to where the color is?
2721900	2722900	Yeah, yeah.
2722900	2726900	You're not quite as good as a climber as Quark is, if I'm not mistaken.
2726900	2731900	Do you have a climb skill, you know, on the right bar of your skill chart?
2731900	2734900	It says no numbers, so that's infinity.
2735900	2737900	It doesn't say any numbers.
2737900	2738900	No numbers are there.
2738900	2740900	So I assume I have all of the climb points.
2740900	2741900	It's infinity, yeah.
2741900	2742900	All right.
2742900	2743900	Well, then I just bounded the top.
2743900	2745900	I climbed down and said, you know what?
2745900	2747900	I see another column over there.
2747900	2748900	What's up there?
2748900	2751900	You just, you can't see, because you have low light vision, right?
2751900	2752900	Not dark vision.
2752900	2753900	Yeah.
2753900	2757900	You can only kind of make out like the outline of like, maybe it looks kind of like a blob.
2757900	2758900	It doesn't really look like much.
2758900	2759900	But it's a color.
2759900	2763900	It's definitely color and everything's pretty much black and white in this world and gray.
2763900	2766900	So it's kind of, it's kind of, you know, contrast.
2766900	2767900	I can levitate.
2767900	2768900	I can levitate.
2769900	2771900	Why don't you go levitate up toward it?
2771900	2772900	I shall.
2773900	2776900	Why don't you, like at Roadhouse, get nipple to nipple with it?
2777900	2779900	Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.
2780900	2782900	Casting levitate, right?
2782900	2783900	Right? That's happening?
2783900	2784900	Yeah.
2784900	2785900	Okay.
2785900	2788900	You flow, you flowly slowed up into the air.
2789900	2791900	Flowly slowed up?
2791900	2792900	Foster Brooks?
2792900	2793900	Ahh.
2793900	2797900	Slow, sounds like a slur against some kind of race.
2798900	2799900	You go into the dead.
2799900	2800900	You go into the dead.
2800900	2801900	You got damn flowly slowed.
2801900	2803900	You go into the underground chamber.
2804900	2806900	So you're floating up in the air.
2806900	2810900	You're a good 20 feet, you know, away from the elevation that you need to be at.
2810900	2812900	So you continue to ascend.
2812900	2813900	Okay.
2813900	2815900	Squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.
2815900	2822900	I use wild empathy and I ask Coco if she knows what that squishing noise is.
2822900	2824900	Why wouldn't you ask the squish person?
2824900	2825900	Oh, they're far away.
2825900	2827900	Or they're not seeable.
2827900	2829900	Like you haven't seen them.
2830900	2832900	Okay, Coco doesn't respond.
2832900	2835900	I mentioned in the last session Shadow Coco can't communicate.
2835900	2836900	Shadow Coco.
2836900	2837900	Yeah.
2837900	2839900	Once you go Shadow Coco.
2840900	2842900	You never go corporeal Coco.
2843900	2845900	As the old saying goes.
2845900	2846900	All right.
2847900	2848900	What can I do here?
2848900	2850900	I feel like I haven't done anything.
2850900	2851900	You got traps.
2851900	2853900	You have a bow.
2853900	2855900	All of these are very aggressive.
2855900	2856900	That's true.
2856900	2857900	I want to do.
2857900	2859900	Hey guys, can we all agree?
2859900	2861900	Let's have a non-conflict resolution.
2861900	2864900	Yeah, let's find the non-conflict resolution in this chapter.
2864900	2865900	All right.
2865900	2866900	Let's do this.
2866900	2867900	I agree.
2867900	2868900	Awesome.
2868900	2869900	All right.
2869900	2870900	I yell out to the thing.
2870900	2872900	Have you heard Lady in Red?
2874900	2875900	Holdo.
2876900	2877900	What did it say?
2877900	2879900	He said, Holdo.
2879900	2880900	I'm sorry.
2880900	2881900	What did you say?
2881900	2882900	What did he say?
2882900	2883900	You whispered?
2883900	2884900	No, I yell.
2884900	2886900	I yell it out at the top of my impressive lungs.
2886900	2888900	Holdo.
2888900	2890900	It's like he's saying Holdo.
2891900	2897900	I yell out, You can pass if you want.
2899900	2903900	We should have decided what you should yell before you yelled that.
2903900	2907900	It's an inversion of the classic, You shall not pass.
2907900	2909900	Good to know.
2910900	2911900	Oh, it's a person who can speak.
2911900	2912900	He's talking to us.
2912900	2913900	See?
2913900	2914900	Squish person.
2914900	2915900	Thanks for the notes.
2915900	2916900	Squish.
2916900	2918900	Do you come and peep?
2919900	2922900	I would say so.
2924900	2925900	Oh, thank God.
2925900	2936900	I clambered down from the column and I walk out into the middle of the columns and I summon the squishy people to me.
2937900	2939900	I'm excited, yes.
2939900	2941900	The squishy people.
2941900	2943900	That also sounds racist.
2944900	2946900	The squishy people.
2947900	2949900	Sharpie's still floating up in the air also.
2949900	2957900	You were probably approaching him, so you'd get to him first before you would get that chronologically unless you want to float down to the ground.
2957900	2958900	Sorry, I don't get that.
2958900	2959900	You're floating in the air.
2959900	2960900	Yeah, I know.
2960900	2961900	You just want to chill?
2961900	2962900	To the color thing.
2962900	2963900	I like it, yeah.
2963900	2964900	Okay, cool.
2964900	2965900	All right.
2965900	2966900	You should keep floating through the color thing, right?
2966900	2967900	That's where you're going.
2967900	2968900	Yeah, am I up by the color thing?
2968900	2969900	You're getting close.
2969900	2970900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2970900	2971900	All right.
2971900	2972900	That's what I'm saying.
2972900	2973900	You're approaching it.
2973900	2974900	Yeah, I'd like to...
2974900	2975900	You make it out.
2975900	2976900	You're the person.
2976900	2977900	What is the person like?
2977900	2979900	Wow, this is getting real racist.
2979900	2988900	You find a wizened old man sitting up in a tree in very tattered yet shimmering white rags that stand out in stark contrast to the black column he is perched in.
2988900	2990900	Holdo!
2990900	2991900	Yeah!
2991900	2993900	Jesus Christ!
2993900	2994900	Derser...
2994900	2995900	Go ahead.
2995900	2997900	Hi, I'm Mollraine.
2997900	2998900	Sweetie.
2998900	2999900	What?
2999900	3000900	You're down there.
3000900	3001900	Yeah, I'm down here.
3001900	3002900	I'm calling up.
3002900	3003900	Okay.
3003900	3004900	Is that okay?
3005900	3006900	Derser!
3007900	3008900	I am Mollraine and...
3008900	3009900	I'm sorry.
3009900	3010900	That's my girlfriend.
3012900	3014900	And these are my friends.
3014900	3017900	We mean you, no harm, obviously.
3017900	3019900	What's your story?
3019900	3021900	Brefey the Wanderer is my name.
3021900	3023900	I've been wandering for all my life.
3023900	3026900	Never sleeping in the same place twice.
3029900	3031900	Sweeping in the same place twice?
3031900	3032900	Twice!
3032900	3034900	I say nothing, I just float back down.
3037900	3039900	I climb up the column to...
3039900	3040900	Brefey?
3040900	3041900	Brefey?
3041900	3042900	Brefey.
3042900	3043900	Brefey?
3043900	3044900	Brefey the Wanderer.
3044900	3045900	I climb up...
3045900	3046900	I'm Brefey!
3046900	3047900	I climb up...
3047900	3048900	I climb up...
3048900	3052900	I like the sound of this guy, so I climb up the column to talk to him.
3052900	3053900	How's it going?
3053900	3057900	I extend a small hand and welcome.
3057900	3059900	He takes your small hand.
3063900	3065900	What is a small hand?
3065900	3066900	I said...
3067900	3069900	Don't you have just the hands you have?
3069900	3070900	I'm small.
3070900	3071900	You can pick hands?
3071900	3073900	I'm a small gentleman.
3073900	3074900	I'm a gnome.
3074900	3075900	Like a...
3075900	3078900	He's about the size of a six-year-old boy.
3078900	3079900	He's a little man.
3079900	3080900	Yeah, I'm a little guy.
3080900	3081900	I didn't know this the entire time!
3081900	3082900	I'm a little guy.
3083900	3086900	In my head, it was just you, but you don't have a tie.
3086900	3087900	Now...
3088900	3090900	Now go back and think of me fucking Coco.
3091900	3092900	It's way better.
3093900	3095900	That's why you had to stand on the tree stump?
3095900	3096900	Yeah.
3096900	3097900	This is like Fight Club for you.
3097900	3098900	You're going back.
3098900	3101900	No, but dude, if I have to fuck a horse at my height, I have to stand on the tree stump.
3101900	3102900	Yeah.
3102900	3105900	Just maybe a less witty one than the one you would have to.
3105900	3106900	Exactly.
3106900	3110900	Okay, so I say to him, look, our shadows have been taken from us.
3110900	3111900	Do you know anything about this?
3111900	3115900	You know, I just saw some shadows wandering down not too long ago.
3116900	3117900	Yeah.
3117900	3122900	Listen, I'd love to help you folks, but right now we're being surrounded by Phantom Fungus.
3122900	3123900	Phantom Fungus!
3123900	3125900	Phantom Fungus!
3127900	3129900	I summon Dalton.
3130900	3131900	I didn't hear that.
3131900	3132900	I'm sorry, what?
3132900	3133900	I don't know.
3133900	3139900	I wish we had a cooler from a notorious roadhouse, ours, to come clean up the action.
3139900	3140900	Yeah, it's time to not be nice.
3140900	3143900	Do I have any like thing I can use here?
3143900	3144900	You have traps.
3144900	3149900	I don't want to, can I ask him something and he can ask the guy?
3149900	3150900	Yeah.
3150900	3151900	Hey!
3151900	3152900	Hey!
3152900	3153900	Quirk.
3153900	3154900	Quirk!
3154900	3155900	Yep, yep.
3155900	3156900	You hear me?
3156900	3157900	Yes, Chris.
3157900	3159900	I've got strong pipes from my years of touring.
3159900	3162900	Could you ask, what's his name, Bruffy?
3162900	3163900	Bruffy.
3163900	3164900	I'm Bruffy.
3165900	3166900	Did he say his name was Bruffy?
3166900	3167900	Bruffy the Wanderer.
3167900	3172900	Could you ask Bruffy if the Phantom Fungus, I mean, they sound like bad guys, but are
3172900	3173900	they good guys or bad guys?
3173900	3175900	And is the Phantom also with an F?
3175900	3176900	Two questions.
3176900	3177900	Okay.
3177900	3182900	Bruffy, when you say we're being surrounded by Phantom Fungus, is that a threat or are
3182900	3183900	they cool?
3183900	3188900	Phantom Funguses are mindless funguses that try to eat people.
3188900	3191900	Also, they're invisible.
3191900	3194900	And impervious to pluralization.
3197900	3198900	Bruffy.
3198900	3199900	Oh, God.
3199900	3201900	Did you not ask the F question?
3201900	3202900	Is Phantom with an F?
3202900	3204900	Or is also fungus with a pH?
3204900	3206900	Can you also ask why he's so unaffected?
3206900	3208900	Why he's not afraid?
3208900	3211900	Are you unafraid because you're standing up on top of the column?
3211900	3214900	I feel like Q-wise, my question was before.
3216900	3217900	If we're going just in terms of...
3217900	3222900	I climb down the column, put Christoperg on my back and climb back up so he can have this
3222900	3223900	conversation with Bruffy the Wanderer.
3223900	3225900	Real quick question, Bruffy.
3226900	3227900	I'm Bruffy.
3227900	3228900	It's gonna...
3228900	3230900	Yeah, I heard that.
3231900	3233900	Now, this seems like it's not gonna be...
3233900	3236900	It's not really gonna count, but is the Phantom with an F?
3236900	3238900	Or is the Fungus with a pH?
3238900	3240900	Or is it spelled like you normally would spell it?
3240900	3244900	He looks down to the ground for a bit, mulling it over.
3245900	3247900	I can't spell!
3248900	3249900	Can you take me back down?
3249900	3250900	Yes.
3251900	3255900	We have a tradition as a group of attacking everything that wants to be friends with us
3255900	3260900	and having these Keystone Cops encounters with everything that's just an animal.
3260900	3266900	Every time a bear just wants to eat us, we end up changing pants with each other.
3267900	3269900	Quirt, can you carry me up there ever?
3269900	3273900	I climb down and drop off Christoperg, pick up Mulray.
3273900	3274900	Thanks, bro.
3274900	3275900	You got it.
3275900	3276900	I'll see you on the flip-flop.
3276900	3280900	If you'd asked him, is a flip-flop with an F or a pH?
3280900	3284900	The first flip is with a P-F, P-F, and the other one's a pH.
3284900	3285900	Like Pfizer.
3285900	3286900	Yes, exactly.
3287900	3289900	And the other one's like fat.
3289900	3292900	Like a Tuesday? Fat Tuesday or a person?
3292900	3293900	Like a pH fat.
3293900	3294900	Like a Tuesday.
3294900	3295900	Like a Tuesday.
3295900	3296900	Okay.
3296900	3301900	So then I put Mulray on my shoulders and I ferry her back up the column to have her ask a question.
3301900	3302900	That happens.
3304900	3305900	Hi.
3306900	3308900	Why aren't you afraid?
3309900	3311900	Well, I'm used to phantom funguses.
3311900	3314900	They come around the ebb and thicket quite often.
3314900	3317900	Can you tell him it should be fungi, not funguses?
3317900	3320900	I climb down and I pick up Christoperg.
3320900	3324900	Oh, and I ask Christoperg, before he goes up, I put a note in his pocket.
3324900	3325900	That's my question.
3325900	3326900	Okay.
3326900	3327900	Sorry.
3327900	3328900	How about this?
3328900	3331900	I climb down the column.
3331900	3334900	I take out a pad of paper and I have everybody write down their questions.
3334900	3337900	Mine is not a question, it's just more of a helpful statement.
3337900	3339900	As that's happening, Brefi comes down.
3339900	3340900	Oh, good. Thank God.
3340900	3343900	Oh, shit. We didn't know you could do that.
3343900	3346900	Brefi, what's your secret for dealing with these phantom fungi?
3346900	3349900	First of all, that is the correct pluralization.
3349900	3352900	I didn't want to be shitty in this sort of moment.
3352900	3353900	It's fungi.
3353900	3356900	That's me as Christoperg talking to Brefi.
3356900	3358900	You should dodge.
3360900	3361900	You do dodge.
3361900	3362900	I dodge.
3362900	3365900	You feel something come within inches of your face.
3366900	3370900	I feel something come within inches of my face.
3372900	3374900	Is this still the black pillar?
3375900	3378900	So I dodged whatever.
3378900	3380900	No, no, he dodged Christoperg.
3380900	3382900	You got it right in your eye.
3384900	3385900	That's not so.
3387900	3388900	That's not so.
3388900	3390900	All right. Okay, so he's down here.
3390900	3392900	So, Brefi, what the fuck?
3392900	3394900	We are being attacked right now.
3394900	3395900	Right now!
3395900	3398900	What advice do you have to give us for the phantom fungus?
3398900	3400900	You get hit in the face.
3400900	3401900	See?
3402900	3403900	I dodge.
3403900	3406900	You feel an invisible presence hit you in the face.
3406900	3408900	I should have just stayed up in that column.
3409900	3410900	That's true.
3412900	3414900	You take six damage.
3414900	3416900	Sharpie, do you have any ideas?
3416900	3418900	Yeah, I cast Mage Armor.
3418900	3419900	That's a good idea.
3420900	3421900	On everybody?
3421900	3422900	Nope.
3423900	3424900	It only works on him.
3424900	3426900	It increases your AC by four.
3427900	3429900	That makes you harder to hit.
3430900	3431900	All of us?
3431900	3432900	Nope, just him.
3432900	3434900	It's an investment.
3437900	3440900	I take my rope.
3440900	3441900	Okay.
3441900	3444900	And I tie the end.
3444900	3445900	To your feet.
3446900	3449900	I tie the end like a loop, like a lasso.
3449900	3451900	And I get out of the way, everyone!
3451900	3453900	My friends get out of the way.
3453900	3455900	And I start whipping it around in the circle.
3456900	3459900	Wait, do you ever tell us how long the rope is?
3459900	3461900	So that we're out of the radius of it.
3461900	3463900	It's 12 feet.
3463900	3465900	All right, let's go 13 feet, everyone.
3465900	3467900	I'm covered in column cum.
3468900	3470900	I'll hold my hand.
3471900	3472900	Careful, everyone.
3472900	3473900	I'll take care of this.
3473900	3477900	I'm going to detect the phantom creatures with my rope tracker.
3478900	3480900	Why are you looking at me like that?
3480900	3482900	No, I'm watching.
3483900	3486900	And I start whipping it around in a circle.
3486900	3489900	And everyone thinks I'm doing a good job.
3490900	3492900	She's doing great at that.
3493900	3495900	Is rope tracker a thing?
3495900	3496900	No, no, it's not.
3497900	3500900	The premise is if there was an invisible entity in the way,
3500900	3502900	the rope would interact with it.
3502900	3503900	Would hit it.
3503900	3506900	So I will know where the phantom fungi are.
3506900	3509900	But she doesn't have a thing in her sheet that says rope tracker.
3509900	3511900	No, she owns a rope.
3511900	3513900	I'm calling it my rope tracker.
3514900	3515900	This is an audible.
3515900	3517900	That's why I'm laughing.
3518900	3519900	You're making up.
3519900	3520900	You're like a heat man.
3520900	3521900	It's just my rope.
3521900	3522900	I'm naming it.
3522900	3523900	Like I named Coco.
3523900	3524900	This is rope tracker.
3524900	3527900	You feel your rope slap against something invisible.
3528900	3529900	Oh, wow.
3529900	3532900	Can I do use rapid shot and fire an arrow?
3532900	3533900	No, don't.
3533900	3534900	Just fire again.
3534900	3536900	We're going to get out of this without fighting it.
3536900	3539900	But these are fungi that are going to eat our faces.
3539900	3542900	Hey, but look at the name fungi, right?
3542900	3543900	But they're attacking us.
3543900	3544900	They're funguses.
3544900	3545900	Yeah.
3545900	3546900	Yeah.
3546900	3547900	Yeah.
3547900	3548900	All right.
3548900	3549900	Funguses.
3550900	3553900	I take out my poison dagger and I sniff it,
3553900	3555900	which most people don't know gets me slightly high,
3555900	3558900	but also gives me I can see invisible things.
3559900	3560900	Yeah, you wish.
3560900	3561900	That'd be cool.
3561900	3563900	You can believe that's true.
3563900	3566900	Maybe can he see where my rope tracker landed?
3566900	3567900	You can all see where it hit.
3567900	3568900	Yeah.
3568900	3569900	Okay.
3569900	3570900	So you can see where it hit something.
3570900	3571900	I hit right there.
3571900	3572900	Yeah, it did.
3573900	3575900	I take out my poison dagger.
3575900	3576900	That's where it hit.
3577900	3580900	I can't detect sarcasm.
3583900	3586900	And I hurl it at the funguses.
3586900	3587900	The sarcasm?
3587900	3588900	No.
3589900	3591900	That is not a constructive thing to use.
3594900	3596900	He flipped it around.
3598900	3600900	By a poison dagger.
3600900	3601900	Okay.
3601900	3602900	So you're throwing the poison dagger.
3602900	3603900	Throw that poison dagger.
3603900	3604900	Throw in the poison dagger.
3604900	3605900	Okay.
3606900	3608900	Whipping back quickly, you strike.
3608900	3611900	The flying, you fling the poison dagger with great grace
3611900	3613900	and swiftness alacrity.
3613900	3615900	They're slightly impressed.
3615900	3616900	Yeah.
3616900	3617900	More than slightly.
3617900	3619900	They're fucking impressed.
3619900	3622900	In the place that you think that the phantom fungus must be.
3624900	3625900	It does not hit.
3626900	3627900	Fuck.
3627900	3628900	Can someone go get my dagger?
3629900	3631900	Spencer, what is weapon focus?
3631900	3636900	Weapon focus makes you better at hitting with the weapon that you have.
3636900	3637900	Shit.
3637900	3638900	I should have known that.
3638900	3641900	Can I still detect, even though I'm covered in the fungus?
3641900	3642900	You know where the rope hit.
3642900	3644900	Whether or not the creature's still there at this point.
3644900	3645900	I mean, maybe.
3645900	3647900	I don't think the thing is in your face still.
3647900	3649900	I think it just hit you and moved on, right?
3649900	3651900	Is Mulrain still swinging her rope tracker?
3651900	3652900	No.
3652900	3654900	I can only do that once or twice.
3654900	3656900	The way the rope tracker works.
3656900	3658900	Just do it until it hits something in my foot.
3658900	3659900	Yeah.
3659900	3661900	What are my goggles and my Newt seeing?
3661900	3665900	If you're searching around, you can see things better, you know.
3665900	3670900	Almost kind of like if you're like an investigator with a magnifying glass or something.
3670900	3671900	Would it help with this?
3671900	3672900	This is invisible.
3672900	3673900	You don't know that it wouldn't.
3673900	3674900	I mean, it'll help you see.
3674900	3675900	And you can't see this.
3675900	3676900	All right.
3676900	3677900	I put on my goggles and my Newt seeing.
3677900	3679900	And I take out my far sword.
3679900	3680900	And I use my weapon focus.
3680900	3684900	And I try to do a far sword attack on the invisible fungus.
3684900	3686900	Donning the goggles of my Newt seeing.
3686900	3691900	You can see things minutely in a way that you couldn't before.
3691900	3693900	You can notice the hazy...
3693900	3694900	Not hazy.
3694900	3697900	You can notice the slight difference between shades of gray,
3697900	3701900	where footsteps appear to be being made on the floor.
3701900	3703900	Swinging your sword in a wide arc.
3703900	3704900	You unfurl a beam.
3704900	3705900	Not a beam.
3705900	3706900	Fuck everything.
3706900	3709900	What if I just like walked out the back right now?
3709900	3713900	Swinging your sword in a wide arc.
3713900	3717900	A burst of far sword energy launches to where you think
3717900	3721900	the phantom fungus is currently residing at.
3721900	3723900	Currently residing.
3723900	3726900	Where it files its taxes.
3726900	3728900	That's a critical hit, you guys.
3728900	3730900	Critical hit.
3730900	3735900	Thank you.
3736900	3740900	It was currently residing.
3740900	3744900	I attack it at home.
3744900	3748900	Your sword says resident.
3748900	3751900	You hear a great whoosh as your blast of energy
3751900	3755900	blasts through the clearing that you were kind of in.
3755900	3758900	You hear a flump flump.
3758900	3761900	You see, materializing before your eyes,
3761900	3764900	two halves of a very disgusting looking phantom fungus
3764900	3766900	lying on the ground slain.
3766900	3767900	You did it.
3767900	3769900	That was amazing.
3769900	3774900	Thank God for that rope tracker.
3774900	3776900	Hey, you know what fungi hate?
3776900	3777900	Funguses.
3777900	3778900	Dryness.
3778900	3779900	Heat.
3779900	3780900	Light.
3780900	3782900	Fireball.
3782900	3783900	But he's dead.
3783900	3784900	Honey, he's dead.
3784900	3785900	Stop.
3785900	3786900	Stop, he's dead.
3786900	3787900	Please.
3787900	3790900	You're just desecrating its corpse now.
3790900	3791900	I thought there was more than one.
3791900	3793900	I thought it was a fun guy, not a fun guy.
3793900	3796900	No, it's funguses, like there's multiple funguses,
3796900	3797900	like you're right.
3797900	3798900	Yeah.
3798900	3799900	Oh, so there's more out there?
3799900	3801900	Yeah, one of them's dead though, totally.
3801900	3802900	Oh, how many more are there?
3802900	3803900	I don't know, man.
3803900	3804900	We don't know.
3804900	3805900	We're invisible.
3805900	3806900	I love how you're...
3806900	3808900	Do you want to borrow my rope tracker?
3808900	3810900	Do you want to let me cast?
3810900	3811900	Do you use it so well?
3811900	3813900	So you don't know where to cast it?
3813900	3816900	Dude, I'm going to aim in the general direction of where...
3816900	3818900	It's a big spell with a big effect,
3818900	3819900	a big area of effect.
3819900	3822900	It's a fireball.
3822900	3827900	Don't do it at the one that's already dead.
3827900	3829900	Can we use the rope tracker to figure out where it is
3829900	3830900	and then use the fire...
3830900	3831900	We're all using it.
3831900	3832900	All right.
3832900	3833900	All right.
3833900	3834900	It's hot.
3834900	3835900	It's like metrosexual.
3835900	3836900	Remember when we were saying that for a while?
3836900	3839900	Mulrin invented rope tracker technology.
3839900	3840900	Let's use it.
3840900	3842900	All right, all right.
3842900	3844900	I'm eating a little bit of crow here
3844900	3847900	because I made fun of it, but I'll wait for the rope tracker
3847900	3849900	to tell me where to cast my fireball.
3849900	3850900	So when you do the rope tracker,
3850900	3852900	we kind of have to, like, get on our knees, right?
3852900	3853900	You don't have to.
3853900	3855900	You're tiny, but it goes up over our heads.
3855900	3856900	Right, right.
3856900	3858900	And I extend the rope to 25 feet.
3858900	3863900	That'll make it a bit harder to control.
3863900	3868900	You're really pushing your new invention to its limits, huh?
3868900	3870900	You remember the first plane was only airborne
3870900	3873900	for, like, 40-some seconds.
3873900	3874900	All right.
3874900	3878900	Well, I bring it back five feet.
3879900	3881900	So, like, 15, 20.
3881900	3883900	Yeah, I forgot what I said last time.
3883900	3885900	Just making sure.
3885900	3886900	20.
3886900	3887900	12?
3887900	3888900	12.
3888900	3889900	So it's 17 now.
3889900	3890900	12.
3890900	3891900	Do 17 feet.
3891900	3892900	17 feet.
3892900	3894900	It's a nice prime number.
3894900	3897900	You guys, the rope tracker wasn't designed for this.
3897900	3898900	For heavy math.
3898900	3900900	This is heavy math, you guys.
3900900	3902900	This is what heavy math is.
3902900	3904900	Simple subtraction.
3904900	3905900	All right.
3905900	3911900	I take the rope tracker, and I whirl it above my head.
3911900	3914900	I feel like it could use a better name, also.
3914900	3917900	The Adventure Facilitator.
3917900	3918900	Okay.
3918900	3919900	That would teach me.
3919900	3921900	I thought I would get a bigger reaction to that.
3921900	3922900	It's still the rope tracker.
3922900	3923900	I whirl it around my head.
3923900	3926900	I'm going to use, like, clock notations.
3926900	3930900	So, you know, your rope strikes an entity at four o'clock.
3930900	3933900	Fireball, four o'clock when I get a chance.
3934900	3936900	Like when you see an attractive girl at a bar.
3936900	3939900	We're using the same nomenclature.
3939900	3940900	I don't...
3940900	3942900	That's what happens at bars.
3942900	3944900	I've been drunk once.
3945900	3948900	I've been drunk more than once.
3948900	3949900	What's happening?
3949900	3950900	Four o'clock.
3950900	3951900	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3951900	3952900	Okay.
3952900	3954900	Casting your arms in a magical manner.
3954900	3957900	You conjure up a brilliant orb of fire,
3957900	3960900	although its light is slightly muted in the shadow plane.
3960900	3962900	Igmamius Infernum.
3962900	3966900	Launching the sphere of light at where you think the rope tracker
3966900	3968900	identified the phantom fungus.
3970900	3971900	It launches.
3972900	3975900	It strikes the ground right where you thought it would be
3975900	3978900	and explodes into a huge radius of fire.
3978900	3981900	The black columns are consumed in the flames,
3981900	3985900	and although it is a bit dim, you can see they're starting to light up in fire.
3985900	3986900	Oops.
3987900	3990900	The charred husk of a phantom fungus falls.
3991900	3992900	Whoo!
3993900	3994900	Yeah!
3995900	3997900	Shoot that poison dagger.
3998900	3999900	Hey, Broughy.
4000900	4002900	Oh, yeah, what's Broughy up to?
4002900	4005900	Hey, guys, I'm Broughy.
4007900	4008900	Jump in any time.
4008900	4010900	You lit the forest on fire.
4011900	4013900	Well, I was pushed to that.
4013900	4016900	Don't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right, Broughy?
4016900	4020900	We're going to have to leave unless you want to die of suffocation.
4020900	4021900	Let's leave.
4021900	4022900	It's that bad?
4023900	4025900	Forest fires will kill you, yeah.
4025900	4027900	Everyone can jump on shadow cocoa, right?
4027900	4028900	Not everyone.
4028900	4030900	I'd say you could fit...
4030900	4032900	I called shotgun on shadow cocoa.
4032900	4033900	Well, I have shotgun.
4033900	4035900	You could fit one person in Quark.
4036900	4038900	Because Quark's really small, so he doesn't want to...
4038900	4040900	I get on the back of cocoa.
4042900	4044900	I don't think that's a good idea.
4047900	4049900	It's like you feel like you've been there before.
4050900	4052900	I can only take one of you.
4052900	4055900	I can cast haste and move very fast.
4055900	4057900	Yeah, you can.
4059900	4061900	I can move.
4063900	4067900	I was going to say I can move silently, but that won't make a difference to a fire, right?
4068900	4070900	It certainly wouldn't.
4070900	4073900	I hide from the fire by closing my eyes.
4074900	4077900	According to De Niro in Backdraft, it's a living thing.
4078900	4079900	All right.
4079900	4081900	Well, I try and reason with it then.
4083900	4087900	You formed some compelling arguments, but it's not soaking in.
4087900	4093900	So is it good to flee these columns, or is there more to be gained from these columns?
4094900	4097900	Was anything ever gained from these columns?
4097900	4098900	The guy, Brefi.
4098900	4099900	Brefi the wanderer.
4099900	4100900	I'm Brefi.
4100900	4104900	But I mean, if those weren't there, he would have just been standing in roughly the same area, probably.
4104900	4106900	Okay, so there's nothing to be gained.
4106900	4108900	Well, Brefi, where should we...
4109900	4110900	Where to?
4110900	4112900	We should get away from the fire.
4113900	4114900	Who are you?
4114900	4117900	Brefi sounds like a character in an old CD-ROM game.
4117900	4119900	I feel like we should keep him around with us.
4119900	4120900	Like Organ Trail?
4120900	4121900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4121900	4124900	I'd like to buy three pounds of bacon.
4126900	4127900	I love the Organ Trail.
4127900	4128900	Me too.
4128900	4129900	Great game.
4129900	4131900	So can I also run with these guys?
4131900	4133900	Oh yeah, I'd recommend it.
4134900	4135900	I do it.
4135900	4136900	Nice.
4137900	4138900	You guys are fleeing the fire.
4138900	4139900	Can I go and get my dagger?
4139900	4140900	Yeah, yeah.
4141900	4142900	There's enough time for that.
4142900	4143900	I get my dagger and then I run.
4144900	4145900	Alright, we flee.
4145900	4147900	Hurriedly fleeing from the fire.
4147900	4150900	You find yourself amidst something I'm going to read.
4151900	4152900	Sweet.
4152900	4157900	The fire is far away now, but you're still within the thicket of columns.
4158900	4165900	And as you can see, there are woven between the black shadowy trees, sticky braid-like nets and meshes of shivering white webbing,
4165900	4169900	which stands out in stark contrast to the dull grays and blacks of the plain.
4169900	4174900	The webbing envelops the entire forest from this point on, blanketing in thick, ropey strands of silk.
4174900	4178900	You can see bubble-like pustules on the webby floor, ominously pulsing,
4178900	4184900	and the path that Brefi has been leading you down is barred by webs and nets strung between the trees.
4185900	4186900	Be careful now.
4186900	4188900	We don't want to disturb any face spiders.
4188900	4190900	Yeah, no shit.
4190900	4191900	What's their name?
4191900	4192900	Face spiders?
4192900	4193900	Phase spiders.
4193900	4195900	Like they attack your face?
4195900	4197900	As in they phase.
4197900	4198900	Phase.
4198900	4199900	Not like face spiders.
4199900	4200900	Yeah, or like phase zeroes.
4200900	4201900	Or the pH.
4201900	4202900	Okay, good.
4204900	4206900	Face spiders sound scarier.
4208900	4209900	Face spiders.
4209900	4211900	Or the face spiders.
4212900	4215900	Guys, I don't want to be a dick, but I don't like Brefi.
4216900	4217900	I don't know.
4217900	4218900	He helps us.
4218900	4219900	What did he help us do?
4219900	4221900	Can we get rid of Brefi?
4221900	4224900	He didn't really help us with the fungus.
4224900	4226900	Is he an earshot of this discussion?
4226900	4228900	Yeah, he is.
4228900	4229900	Can we infer?
4229900	4230900	I guess you can specify otherwise.
4230900	4231900	I take Brefi.
4231900	4236900	I try and make a loud sound while you guys discuss it so he can't hear.
4236900	4238900	I take Brefi in Roadhouse fashion.
4239900	4241900	I sing that.
4241900	4248900	And I take Brefi by the collar, if he has a collar on, and I pin him up against a tree.
4248900	4250900	His collar is vaguely sticky.
4250900	4253900	Okay, well it helps me hold on to it better.
4253900	4254900	It definitely does, yeah.
4254900	4261900	And I hold him up against the tree and I go, listen Brefi, if you let us into a trap, so help me God, I'll knee you in the nuts.
4261900	4262900	Sam Elliott style.
4263900	4267900	Does this look as adorable as I think it looks?
4269900	4271900	That's your guy's call.
4271900	4273900	You shouldn't knee him in the nuts just to be safe.
4273900	4274900	All right, I'll good cop this.
4274900	4276900	Hey, hey man, why would Lee-
4276900	4278900	No, Sharpie, stand down!
4278900	4282900	Why would he lead us into a trap by telling us to be careful for phase spiders?
4282900	4287900	Listen, we left the fire and he took us into a phase spider nest.
4287900	4291900	No, we just ran from the fire and he's warning us about this.
4291900	4294900	We just thought this was elegant white silk.
4294900	4296900	I mean, should we use the rope tracker?
4296900	4298900	Well, we know where this stuff is.
4298900	4302900	I mean, it's a great invention, but I don't think we need it every step of the way.
4302900	4305900	Is there a way to get around the phase spider area?
4305900	4307900	I mean, why would we have to walk through this?
4307900	4308900	Because you're getting-
4308900	4309900	It's a fire, but-
4309900	4310900	You are fleeing a fire.
4310900	4313900	I mean, you could, yeah, you could pick your way away from it.
4313900	4320900	Can I use, is there a magic beast that I could summon that could kind of guide us through this area?
4320900	4328900	You can summon nature's allies, but they wouldn't be particularly great at guiding you through because they're from a different plane.
4328900	4329900	So-
4329900	4330900	Just silence.
4330900	4332900	So I shouldn't do that.
4332900	4338900	I mean, if you wanted another ally on your team, it would work, but if you wanted a guide, it wouldn't work.
4338900	4341900	Can I use a Hat of Disguise and look like a phase spider?
4341900	4345900	No, you can only emulate humanoid creatures with the Hat of Disguise.
4345900	4347900	Aren't I from this area?
4347900	4352900	You're from the plane of Twyla, which is a different dimension than the plane of shadow, but they're related.
4352900	4353900	So are there-
4353900	4355900	I think that we have to go through this.
4355900	4357900	You don't have to do anything.
4357900	4364900	Is there, are there like, is it like an alternate dimension, like a shadow world, so there would be real world counterpart to this area?
4364900	4365900	Yeah, definitely.
4365900	4367900	So I do know the terrain a little bit.
4367900	4374900	Well, actually, interestingly enough, it's different than the plane of Twyla that you remember, so it's not the same.
4374900	4378900	Maybe it's similar a bit, but it's not the same as the plane you're recognizing.
4378900	4380900	Guys, there's nothing I can do.
4380900	4383900	So I examine the immediate surroundings right in front of us.
4383900	4388900	Like there's the path before you, but it's covered in web, so you'd have to like cut down the web.
4388900	4389900	I take out my sword.
4389900	4392900	That's not a good idea. That's how they find out.
4392900	4394900	Or you could sneak through them like-
4394900	4396900	Okay, I think that's better.
4396900	4399900	I use my ability to have my small size and my ability to sneak about.
4399900	4400900	You're sneaky, too.
4400900	4402900	Or you can put them on fire.
4402900	4404900	No, that's what they'll come for.
4404900	4406900	Light them on fire.
4406900	4410900	That didn't work for us like two minutes ago.
4410900	4412900	Or you could light yourselves on fire.
4412900	4414900	I'm just throwing out options.
4414900	4419900	I mean, we're running- the reason we're here is because one fireball took out a whole forest.
4419900	4422900	I mean, it's kind of like having the US Air Force on our side.
4422900	4424900	We could just defoliate this area.
4424900	4426900	Anybody out there have any advice for us?
4426900	4428900	They're basically like drones.
4428900	4430900	Yes, somebody was raising their hand.
4431900	4434900	I think their advice would be to pause it and-
4434900	4440900	We should close out the show and address the Spider-Nest next week, right?
4440900	4441900	Yeah.
4441900	4442900	Cliffhanger?
4442900	4444900	Yeah. We've got to pick a movie for next week.
4444900	4446900	Spider-Nest, Cliffhanger!
4452900	4454900	Because, I mean, what would happen?
4454900	4456900	Thank you, Camille Nangiani.
4456900	4458900	One more time for Camille.
4459900	4461900	Camille Nangiani.
4461900	4462900	Aaron McGathey.
4467900	4468900	Hi.
4470900	4472900	Jesus Christ.
4472900	4475900	She just spilled her wine.
4475900	4479900	She handed me her character sheet and it was kind of soaked with wine.
4479900	4480900	Sorry.
4480900	4482900	I didn't get my suit, did I?
4482900	4484900	Just a little clumsy.
4484900	4486900	I'm supposed to have a baby with you?
4486900	4487900	What?
4487900	4488900	What?
4502900	4505900	I like that you say, I'm supposed to.
4505900	4508900	Like, you're an alien and you're overlord.
4508900	4511900	We said, you must procreate with her.
4511900	4513900	Sorry I spilled my wine.
4513900	4516900	Yeah, one day you'll be spilling wine for two.
4518900	4521900	Think about that, Dan. If you get me pregnant, I won't drink.
4521900	4522900	Oh, all right.
4522900	4525900	Well, don't negotiate with terrorists.
4529900	4530900	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
4530900	4531900	Oh, wait.
4531900	4533900	Always make an exit.
4537900	4538900	It's like a crime scene over here.
4538900	4541900	There's fucking red wine everywhere.
4541900	4542900	Think about it.
4542900	4545900	Nine months in which I'll be absolutely incapable of.
4545900	4547900	I dare you to get me pregnant.
4549900	4550900	All right.
4550900	4553900	I think I would like...
4553900	4556900	I'm going to be selfish here and use the Harman Town Movie Club
4556900	4558900	as my own personal movie jukebox
4558900	4561900	and assign a movie that I would like to watch again
4561900	4563900	and discuss next week.
4563900	4564900	I think that's fair.
4564900	4565900	Yeah.
4565900	4566900	And what else would a bad job be?
4566900	4570900	Was the person that suggested Roadhouse last week here tonight?
4570900	4571900	Who is that?
4571900	4572900	What's your name?
4572900	4573900	This young lady here.
4573900	4574900	Lesette.
4574900	4575900	Lesette, thank you very much.
4575900	4576900	Thank you.
4576900	4577900	Yeah, it was delightful.
4577900	4579900	It was a good chance to see a movie I hadn't seen.
4579900	4580900	Yeah.
4580900	4583900	But there's a movie I have seen that I think everyone should see
4583900	4586900	and that whether or not everyone in this audience has seen it again...
4586900	4587900	I have seen it.
4587900	4588900	I think they should see it again.
4588900	4591900	I brought up Zardoz in the green room.
4591900	4592900	Yes.
4592900	4594900	I really want people to...
4594900	4595900	By applause.
4595900	4596900	Who has not seen Zardoz?
4596900	4597900	By applause.
4597900	4598900	Wow.
4598900	4599900	Oh, okay.
4599900	4600900	So this is important.
4600900	4606900	How much do you want to see Sean Connery in fur, leggings, and diapers?
4606900	4610900	Well, we won't go into too much detail.
4610900	4611900	It's a good each.
4611900	4614900	Start it earlier than you think you should.
4614900	4616900	Don't start this at 11 p.m.
4616900	4619900	Don't go to the bar with your friends and then go like,
4619900	4621900	eight o'clock Zardoz my place and smoke a joint.
4621900	4622900	Like, this is a...
4622900	4623900	Yeah.
4623900	4624900	It's a movie...
4624900	4627900	Have an espresso.
4627900	4633900	Like, break it into two days, maybe, because the last third of the movie goes very 70s.
4633900	4635900	I mean, the whole thing is insane.
4635900	4642900	Without spoiling anything, the director's commentary that I listened to at the beginning
4642900	4643900	of the movie is...
4643900	4644900	What's the guy's name?
4644900	4645900	John Borman?
4645900	4646900	I think...
4646900	4649900	He says something like...
4649900	4653900	If this isn't the quote, then it's funnier than this.
4653900	4656900	He says, like, hello, I'm John Borman.
4656900	4663900	I directed a movie called Zardoz in 19, whatever it is, 79.
4663900	4666900	It took X weeks to shoot.
4666900	4669900	The budget was X million dollars.
4669900	4673900	And I'll be the first to admit, it kind of got away from me.
4673900	4675900	It's something like that.
4675900	4681900	If that's not what he precisely says, then what he says is actually even funnier than that.
4681900	4683900	And the movie is...
4683900	4684900	It's nuts.
4684900	4685900	More so than Roadhouse.
4685900	4689900	I mean, it's just beyond, because the 70s was a completely different time.
4689900	4695900	Before that shark blew up at the end of Jaws, there was a different era in cinema when there
4695900	4699900	was a whole different timeline that might have been where American cinema was just like,
4699900	4701900	it could have been anything.
4701900	4706900	We still thought movies was a thing that you did that was kind of half art, half populist
4706900	4707900	pacification.
4707900	4710900	It wasn't fully just like, hey, everything has to happen.
4710900	4711900	It was weird.
4711900	4718900	In the 70s, a movie could just end with the hero blowing his own brains out.
4718900	4721900	It would just go to black and just credits would roll in silence.
4721900	4724900	You never knew what the fuck was going to happen at the end of a movie.
4724900	4727900	Zardoz, you don't know what the fuck is going to happen at the beginning of the movie.
4727900	4728900	I've seen that movie three times.
4728900	4731900	I don't know what that movie's about.
4731900	4732900	It's a little bit...
4732900	4734900	There are elements of it that are...
4734900	4735900	That's what's great about it.
4735900	4739900	It's not just a shitty movie that's...
4739900	4742900	My favorite thing about bad movies is not...
4742900	4746900	Because this is what I didn't like about leprechaun and the hood and stuff,
4746900	4750900	and why I won't even bother to watch Piranha 3D and stuff like that.
4750900	4755900	There's a line where the shitty movie is self-aware of its shittiness,
4755900	4759900	and it's like, hey, you'll watch a shitty movie.
4759900	4761900	Let's make a shitty movie.
4761900	4765900	My favorite shitty movies are shitty movies that are trying to be Citizen Kane,
4765900	4768900	and Zardoz really fits the bill.
4768900	4772900	Xanadu is another one, and I think Roadhouse kind of qualifies.
4772900	4774900	It's like, hey, let's blow people's minds with this movie.
4774900	4778900	Zardoz is like, let's watch it, and we'll talk about it a little bit.
4778900	4781900	It hits on themes of immortality. I know that.
4781900	4783900	Dan, can we get Lisette up on stage?
4783900	4785900	I want to talk about the ending of Roadhouse.
4785900	4786900	Okay, fine.
4786900	4788900	Lisette, would you come up on stage with us?
4788900	4792900	Thank you.
4792900	4794900	Grab a mic, Lisette.
4794900	4797900	Lisette, you're very familiar with the movie Roadhouse, obviously.
4797900	4798900	Yes, I am.
4798900	4799900	Can we talk about the ending of that movie?
4799900	4801900	Yes, what in particular?
4801900	4805900	When the polar bear falls on the fat guy.
4805900	4808900	Oh, yes, the code of silence, sort of.
4808900	4809900	Yeah.
4809900	4811900	So the fat guy is a bad guy, right?
4811900	4812900	Yes, he is.
4812900	4814900	And he keeps getting his ass kicked throughout the film.
4814900	4815900	Yes.
4815900	4816900	And he keeps coming back for more.
4816900	4817900	Right.
4817900	4822900	He gets, Patrick Swayze, he hides behind a water buffalo or a yak at some point.
4822900	4827900	And then he's ducking and dodging between Ben Gazera's stuffed animals.
4827900	4828900	Right.
4828900	4832900	And there's a lot of gay threats, and he's going to fuck him in the ass and mount his ass,
4832900	4835900	and there's like weird things going on.
4835900	4839900	And then the fat guy is running around, and then all of a sudden Patrick Swayze,
4839900	4843900	we presume, is pushing a polar bear on wheels toward him.
4843900	4846900	And he puts four or five bullets into the polar bear.
4846900	4847900	Right.
4847900	4849900	And it falls down on him, and it seems to kill him.
4849900	4851900	But it just turns out it stuns him, right?
4851900	4852900	Right.
4852900	4853900	Okay, take it.
4853900	4854900	Did you, Lizette?
4854900	4856900	Well, if you want me to do some kind of like analysis.
4856900	4862900	I want you to tell me what you think the ending of that movie, like explain the end of that
4862900	4863900	movie to me.
4863900	4867900	Well, towards the end, what's his name, Mr. Waverly?
4867900	4868900	Yes.
4868900	4872900	Mr. Waverly is gunned down by the townspeople who he fucked over.
4872900	4873900	Right.
4873900	4875900	And thrown through a coffee table.
4875900	4876900	Right.
4876900	4879900	Because of the last act of defenestration, there's so many windows being thrown through.
4879900	4881900	The last window is the window to the floor.
4881900	4884900	There's a giant square glass coffee table.
4884900	4889900	There's only one piece of plate glass left of this town, and you're going through it.
4889900	4892900	But he's also been shot 11 times.
4892900	4897900	It actually seems as if like he did some kind of acrobatics and like jumped it backwards.
4897900	4898900	That's what it looks like.
4898900	4899900	Yeah.
4899900	4901900	And also they punch a guy, his nose is already bloody first.
4901900	4904900	The nose is already bloody, and the fist comes in.
4904900	4905900	It's already the blood.
4905900	4909900	But then the fat guy, when everybody, they gather up the guns at the end, and like we're
4909900	4910900	going to hide the crime.
4910900	4911900	It's going to be a code of silence.
4911900	4912900	Right.
4912900	4918900	And then in the background, the fat guy, who we, a moment ago, was squashed by a giant...
4918900	4919900	Appears out of nowhere.
4919900	4921900	Yeah, one and a half ton bear.
4921900	4922900	Polar bear, by any means.
4922900	4926900	But he's kind of like up, he's like, he's in the background, like, oh, he's still got
4926900	4927900	his gun.
4927900	4928900	Like, God damn it.
4928900	4931900	Yeah, it's like, it's like, hey, so and so, do you know anything?
4931900	4932900	No, I don't.
4932900	4933900	Do you know anything?
4933900	4934900	No, I don't.
4934900	4935900	Do you know anything?
4935900	4937900	All I know is I got hit on by a polar bear.
4937900	4939900	Yeah, I got knocked over by a bear.
4939900	4942900	And then they cut to him fucking sharp titties again.
4942900	4946900	Oh, can we talk about Kelly Lynch's boob job a little bit in that movie?
4946900	4947900	Wow.
4947900	4948900	Kelly Lynch, right?
4948900	4949900	Yeah, Kelly Lynch.
4949900	4950900	There was some complicated boobs.
4950900	4953900	I know, I know her as the mom from Curly Sue, that's all I know.
4953900	4954900	Oh, right.
4954900	4955900	Wow.
4955900	4957900	That was a strange, strange set of tits.
4957900	4958900	Razor sharp.
4958900	4959900	Razor sharp, yeah.
4959900	4961900	Yeah, you could have put a sweaty eyes out.
4961900	4968900	And walleyed, like a clear division between them, like one in each armpit, perfectly round,
4968900	4969900	kind of like.
4969900	4970900	Right, right.
4970900	4973900	I don't know how you describe that, like a boob here and a boob there, like headlights,
4973900	4975900	like with a total grill between them.
4975900	4978900	Well, I would prefer that she have that versus sand dollar nipples.
4978900	4980900	That would have been not an impact.
4980900	4981900	You don't like the sand dollar nipples?
4981900	4983900	I'm not a fan, no.
4983900	4991900	You'd rather have the pointy, like angular carved out of wood tits.
4991900	4993900	Those tits are roughly hewn.
4993900	4997900	I would say they were more aesthetically pleasing, I think, for cinematic purposes.
4997900	4998900	I think, yeah.
4998900	5002900	What would you say the ideal nipple size diameter would be, Lissette?
5002900	5003900	If you had to pick?
5003900	5008900	The diameter is half a radius or double the radius, I forget.
5008900	5009900	No, it's double.
5009900	5010900	Double the radius.
5010900	5011900	Yeah, double the radius.
5011900	5012900	Sorry, math tutor, duh.
5012900	5022900	I would say no bigger than two or three centimeters, maybe no bigger.
5022900	5023900	Two or three centimeters?
5023900	5024900	Yeah.
5024900	5027900	Okay, you went metric on us, I love that.
5027900	5028900	Yeah.
5028900	5029900	Okay.
5029900	5031900	Let's go with stuff in our pockets, a quarter or a half dollar?
5031900	5033900	No bigger, I'd say no bigger than a nickel.
5033900	5034900	Right.
5034900	5038900	Wait, depending on how old you are and if we're not, we're talking pre or post lactation.
5038900	5040900	Well, isn't it hugely dependent on the breast size?
5040900	5041900	Not necessarily.
5041900	5046900	No, your nipple expands actually according to how much milk you lactate and...
5046900	5048900	Or this is biology speaking.
5048900	5050900	Why would I have you up here earlier?
5050900	5057900	If you had a boob the size of a basketball, couldn't your areoli be bigger?
5057900	5060900	Not according to a lot of the porn I've seen, no.
5060900	5064900	We're saying the full areola, nipple being the whole areola, no bigger than a nipple?
5064900	5066900	No, no bigger than a nickel.
5066900	5067900	Nickel.
5067900	5068900	Yeah.
5068900	5069900	A nickel, sorry.
5069900	5074900	But then again, you have to ask yourself if we're talking pre or post lactation and
5074900	5076900	how old is the woman?
5076900	5077900	But we're trying...
5077900	5080900	I don't know why the question was this, but the question...
5080900	5085900	We were asking, he was asking, what's the ideal nipple size?
5085900	5088900	Now we've gone into what's the likely nipple size.
5088900	5091900	I would say ideally why not, no bigger than a nickel.
5091900	5092900	You're talking nickel sized nipples?
5092900	5093900	Yes.
5093900	5094900	Areola all told?
5094900	5095900	Yeah, why not?
5095900	5096900	Nickel.
5096900	5097900	Nickel between...
5097900	5098900	All right, nickel to quarter.
5098900	5099900	Are you nickel quarter?
5099900	5100900	What's happening?
5100900	5101900	What's happening?
5101900	5102900	I'm really a man, actually.
5102900	5103900	Really?
5103900	5104900	Yeah.
5104900	5105900	All right, take him out.
5105900	5106900	No, thank you.
5106900	5107900	Take him out, Lisette.
5107900	5108900	Let's thank Lisette.
5108900	5109900	I think we're coming up.
5109900	5110900	Lisette, thank you.
5110900	5111900	Shit.
5111900	5112900	That went to places unknown.
5112900	5113900	Thank you, Lisette.
5113900	5125900	We will table that nipple discussion until next week.
5125900	5127900	What are you, Howard Stern?
5128900	5129900	What's happening?
5129900	5132900	She has such a hard, fast rule on nickel sized nipples.
5132900	5133900	I mean, you brought her up.
5133900	5134900	You asked her about nipples.
5134900	5135900	She started answering.
5135900	5137900	And then you're like, get yours out.
5137900	5138900	Put them out.
5138900	5141900	I'm a journalist, Dan.
5141900	5142900	Nipple to nipple.
5142900	5143900	Nipple to nipple.
5143900	5144900	Exactly.
5144900	5145900	Roadhouse style.
5145900	5146900	Yes, yes, yes, everyone.
5146900	5147900	Yes.
5148900	5151900	But be nice until it's time not to be nice.
5151900	5152900	Exactly.
5152900	5153900	Whatever.
5153900	5154900	I have no notes.
5154900	5155900	I'm not critiquing anyone.
5155900	5156900	I had a fine time.
5156900	5157900	Thank you for coming.
5157900	5158900	I had a ball.
5158900	5159900	It was a Harvard town meeting.
5159900	5160900	How do we close the show?
5160900	5161900	What do we do?
5161900	5162900	All right.
5162900	5163900	Okay, Dan.
5163900	5164900	Are you going to try this out?
5164900	5165900	Yep.
5165900	5166900	All right.
5166900	5167900	We're going to end big.
5167900	5168900	We're going to fucking go out swinging here.
5168900	5169900	This is huge.
5169900	5170900	Zach said this one's gnarly.
5170900	5173900	Feel it first.
5173900	5176900	When it comes to you.
5176900	5178900	Yo, yo, yo.
5178900	5180900	Middle East, yo.
5180900	5181900	Bizarre, yo.
5181900	5183900	Yo, yo.
5183900	5185900	Sand new man.
5185900	5187900	Yo, yo.
5187900	5188900	9-11 mother.
5188900	5189900	Yeah.
5189900	5190900	My name's Dan Harmon, motherfucker.
5190900	5193900	I'm going to fuck your ass like my name was Chris Tucker.
5193900	5196900	Go into tuna sand duna and fuck a camel.
5196900	5200900	Going to fuck your mama so hard the tooth enamel came off.
5200900	5210900	I made her cough and my cum came up and went up to the thing.
5210900	5211900	Sing.
5211900	5215900	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
5215900	5216900	Stop singing.
5216900	5218900	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5218900	5219900	What do I do?
5219900	5220900	Stop singing, motherfucker.
5220900	5221900	Whoa.
5221900	5222900	Dan, Dan, Dan.
5222900	5226900	All you have to do is keep rapping as hard as you can.
5226900	5230900	Dance as hard as you can and make those pants come down, baby.
5230900	5232900	I'm going to say, use that in case of emergency.
5232900	5234900	In case the lyrics don't get where you want to go.
5234900	5237900	I fucked your mama so hard she got on a plane.
5237900	5240900	I fucked your mama, I caused a vagina pain.
5240900	5245900	I fucked your mama, the flotation device got out of the plane and made her feel nice.
5245900	5248900	She took a parachute down to the sea.
5248900	5251900	I fucked your mama for America and you and me.
5251900	5254900	I fucked your mama so hard her thighs started to shake.
5254900	5257900	I fucked your mama like her name was Duke Nukem or Quake.
5257900	5260900	I fucked your mama like a first person shooter.
5260900	5263900	I fucked your mama in her pussy and her pooter.
5263900	5266900	I fucked your mama in her shoe and her eye.
5266900	5269900	I fucked your mama till the day I die.
5269900	5272900	I've seen the future and I've seen the past.
5272900	5275900	I fucked your mama so hard she's the first and the last.
5275900	5278900	I love your mama, I'm committed to her.
5278900	5281900	I fucked your mama like I was made of fur.
5281900	5284900	I'm a big Harry Sean Connery motherfucker.
5284900	5286900	I fucked your mama because...
5286900	5287900	Chris Tucker.
5287900	5288900	Yeah, okay.
5288900	5290900	Give me a chance.
5290900	5292900	I fucked your mama till I lost my pants.
5292900	5297900	Going to dance up and down till my pants come down around my ankles.
5297900	5299900	Oh, different song.
5311900	5312900	All right.
5316900	5319900	Wrap it till my pants come down.
5319900	5321900	Wrap it till I'm all alone.
5321900	5322900	Wrap it.
5322900	5324900	Change the pronunciation of words.
5324900	5326900	Wrap it till I show you where my turds are made.
5327900	5328900	In my butt.
5328900	5331900	I'm going to wrap till my pants come down.
5331900	5334900	I'm going to wrap till my pants come down.
5334900	5335900	I'm going to wrap...
5335900	5336900	I can't...
5336900	5339900	Thinking of two things and rapping at the same time.
5339900	5341900	Very hard makes it hard to rhyme.
5341900	5344900	Dancing around till my pants fall down.
5344900	5347900	Only thing you can say is down and rhymes with clown.
5347900	5349900	Fuck your mama so hard as in the sky.
5349900	5351900	I can't do it.
5351900	5352900	I can't do it.
5352900	5353900	All right.
5357900	5359900	You just wrap.
5359900	5361900	You just wrap.
5361900	5363900	I'll take care of the rest.
5363900	5364900	All right.
5364900	5366900	Just give me a second.
5366900	5368900	Good night.
5368900	5370900	Hope you drove home real safe.
5370900	5373900	Fucked your mama so hard her thighs chafed.
5373900	5376900	Fucked your mama in a restaurant yesterday.
5376900	5377900	Fucked your mama so hard.
5377900	5378900	All right.
5378900	5379900	Come on.
5379900	5380900	Stop it.
5380900	5382900	We got to...
5382900	5383900	Now stop it.
5383900	5385900	Don't restart it.
5386900	5387900	We blew it.
5387900	5388900	We can't do it.
5388900	5391900	We can't end the show that way.
5391900	5392900	You've heard of a false start.
5392900	5393900	That's a false stop.
5393900	5394900	Like, we can't...
5394900	5396900	We got to figure out a different way to end the show.
5396900	5398900	Why couldn't your pants fall down?
5398900	5399900	Well, I can't...
5399900	5402900	My pants can fall down, but I can't improvise a wrap
5402900	5405900	while I'm making my pants fall down.
5405900	5406900	What do you want from me?
5406900	5408900	Like, what?
5408900	5410900	Neither of us get paid to do the show.
5410900	5413900	Can you focus on the wrap?
5413900	5416900	Just forget about the pants and just focus on the wrap.
5416900	5417900	But I already did...
5417900	5418900	There's only so much...
5418900	5421900	You know, history has taught us that there's only so much
5421900	5424900	wrap in me.
5424900	5427900	You know, once we get into the eighth, ninth, tenth verse,
5427900	5434900	like, it starts to be kind of uncompelling for them.
5434900	5439900	They start to get disappointed and sad and anxious.
5439900	5441900	They start looking for the door.
5441900	5442900	They get a little upset.
5442900	5443900	Yeah, but this is when things...
5443900	5444900	They start to feel held hostage.
5444900	5445900	But this is when things are exciting.
5445900	5448900	Like, on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, like, you know...
5448900	5451900	It takes you to hell, but you know it's going to end.
5451900	5454900	It's not like the cart stops and Mr. Toad goes,
5454900	5459900	okay, well, sorry about taking you to hell.
5459900	5461900	Something's wrong with one of the tires.
5461900	5464900	I'm just going to get out Mr. Toad's Wild Toolbox
5464900	5467900	and try to figure out what's going on.
5467900	5469900	Hold on an indefinite number of minutes.
5469900	5471900	Like, you'd be scared.
5471900	5472900	You'd feel out of control.
5472900	5474900	You wouldn't go on that Wild Ride.
5474900	5476900	Well, take us to hell, then, because Mr. Toad's Wild Ride...
5476900	5478900	We're in hell, and I'm saying I'm getting out of my toolbox,
5478900	5484900	and it's not a good Wild Ride.
5484900	5487900	I'm embarrassed.
5487900	5489900	I want to be a good showman.
5489900	5493900	I want to be a good host.
5493900	5496900	You are a good showman.
5501900	5519900	Thank you for coming to Harmontown, everybody.
5519900	5526900	One more time for Camille Nantiani, Aaron McGathey,
5526900	5530900	Spencer Crifden,
5530900	5532900	Lisette, thank you very much.
5532900	5534900	Aldrin, happy birthday.
5534900	5536900	Everybody here at Meltdown.
5536900	5540900	I'm Jeff Davis.
5540900	5543900	Now get ready for the fucking show-closing,
5543900	5546900	show-stopping freestyle rap,
5546900	5548900	pants around his ankles, styles,
5548900	5551900	of the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon.
5551900	5554900	Show-stopping, gum-stopping,
5554900	5557900	buck your mama out sweeping and mopping,
5557900	5559900	put rice on the shelf,
5559900	5562900	fucked your mama so high I started to belch,
5562900	5565900	fucked your mama now and then,
5565900	5568900	fucked your mama like a hen she was pecking
5568900	5570900	at the seeds in my balls,
5570900	5572900	fucked your mama in Niagara Falls
5572900	5575900	with in a barrel down her vagina,
