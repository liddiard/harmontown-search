0	11360	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics with the Meltdown, Nerd Milk, Melty Milk,
11360	22160	Showroom Milk, Harmon Town is now in session.
22160	43760	Your Game Master is always Spencer Crittenden, and the Mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harbin.
43760	46760	Thank you.
46760	55280	Hey, Chris, can we finish that conversation, it feels important.
55280	58280	Should I go like this?
58280	62800	Oh, okay.
62800	70040	I don't want to be an asshole, but why not put the mic there?
70040	78000	It's only for my edification.
78000	79560	This is for the cameras.
79560	89680	As we continue to ruin the audio podcast with our horrible cameras and our need, video killed
89680	92160	the radio star.
92160	96600	Video podcasting is killing, but you used to just tune in for the soothing sound of my
96600	99580	lullaby voice.
99580	104500	Just focus on the resonating chamber of my velociraptor skull.
104500	112540	Anyways, so God, the earth is changing underneath our feet, Jeff.
112540	120140	Imagine telling your 25-year-old self, hey, I'm Jeff Davis, it's the year 2015, I'm sending
120140	122300	you a message from the future.
122300	127100	The Supreme Court has just determined that everyone in the whole country, marriage is
127100	138420	just marriage, that's all it is.
138420	141260	And Canada did it 10 years before, but that's not the point.
141260	147620	Oh, yeah, well, no, we're America, we're first in war, 21st in marriage, right?
147620	150860	Just beneath Ireland.
150860	157020	But also, you wouldn't even know what a podcast was then, but you're sending a message saying,
157020	162300	the President of the United States is going to be a guest on Mark Maron's podcast, he's
162300	170220	going to say the N-word, and he's going to sing Amazing Grace at a funeral.
170220	171220	That was rad.
171220	172220	That was great.
172220	173420	I just heard about that.
173420	175420	He can sing, too?
175420	180300	Oh, I mean, pretty good for a president, but I feel like with some classes, he could really
180300	183300	pull it out.
183300	186820	I haven't heard.
186820	187820	That's good enough.
187820	189900	But he was doing an acapella, and he was doing it in a key.
189900	194820	What I love is the organist, I think, on the choir, finds him, and misses just by like
194820	200460	a half note, and Obama finds it.
200460	204540	The organist puts it in a key, and then they all start singing along.
204540	207980	But there was that moment when he started singing, and everyone's like, stand up, the
207980	211220	fucking President is singing right now.
211220	214980	We're going to miss this guy so much.
214980	221420	The lame duck Obama is the fucking FDR of the 21st century.
221420	222420	He's amazing.
222420	227380	He's just like, by the way, here's how I really feel, and we're like, oh, yeah, that's why
227380	230500	I voted for you a long time ago.
230500	235380	He had a very good week, and not just he, but lots of people, and he didn't spike a
235380	238900	lot of footballs and do a lot of end zone dancing.
238900	239980	He just kept it.
239980	240980	He's very classy.
240980	241980	He's very charming, I think.
242980	243980	Think about this guy.
243980	251660	OK, so this N-word thing, have we been clear on this?
251660	261060	Do we understand this notion of he of all people, these thoughts that start with he
261060	267660	of all people, that that's the same thing as ... Do we understand that politically and
267660	273740	strategically Obama is less allowed to talk about race than any pre-existing president,
273740	278940	that he has been targeted by more racism, that his Twitter account can't say, hey, sign
278940	282540	up for healthcare without ... I always click on it because I'm always fascinated.
282540	283700	It's always the N-word.
283700	289140	It's always somewhere in there, literally just the N-word, just like someone just wants
289140	297180	to remind him, just wants to tell him.
297180	302300	People that want him to speak out and make everything right at every time in this changing
302300	307860	age when everything we're finding out about this racially hot things, like the president
307860	314740	of the United States, is that supposed to necessarily come down to every city and make
314740	322540	a big speech and raise a big stink about everything that's going wrong, let alone the first black
322540	324800	president of the United States.
324800	330220	Every time that guy speaks up about anything racial, people just fucking jump.
330220	334420	He's been strategic and he's been practical and now he doesn't have to be.
334420	342380	He goes into Mark Marin's garage and fucking lays it down and rounding out the triumvirate
342380	349260	of holy shit, the dream is coming true, the LAPD is now killing middle-aged white men.
350260	352260	No, that's also horrible.
352260	357260	I hope his family isn't the fan.
357260	361260	I'm sorry, is there something in the news today that I don't know about?
361260	363260	No, not in the way we talked about it last week.
363260	366260	It's old news, but it's also like, what the fuck is going on?
366260	369260	They took these cops that shot that guy.
369260	371260	I'm going to lay my cards on the table.
371260	373260	Let's just go to the racist place.
373260	375260	Let me be a white racist.
375260	378260	Please, let me.
378260	381260	So that we don't have to worry about that anymore.
381260	383260	Is Dan being racist?
383260	388260	Let me be insensitive and racist so that we can cut straight through to what's really
388260	393260	disturbing about a white 48-year-old guy holding a towel.
393260	398260	Get a gun down by cops who, according to their training, are supposed to shoot you if you
398260	400260	hold a towel up.
400260	403260	Why aren't towels illegal?
403260	410260	Why aren't cops illegal?
410260	414260	This is getting extreme.
414260	420260	And if it takes a white guy to make white people go, oh, okay, deal breaker.
420260	427260	It's not because we think that the black people deserve it.
427260	432260	It's because secretly white liberals are going, I think that the racist part of white
432260	438260	liberals is the part of us that goes vigilante about race relations.
438260	440260	That's what white people do.
440260	444260	We're like, I'm racist.
444260	447260	We're born racist, as you know.
447260	450260	That's the one racist thing I'll accept.
450260	453260	White people are born racist.
453260	459260	The racist part of us goes, when we hear about the cop brutality stuff, you know that part
460260	466260	of us is going, yeah, but that's got to be a hard job.
466260	472260	Dressed like Hitler youth, like walking around a bunch of black people.
472260	474260	That's got to be tough.
474260	476260	You know that we think that.
476260	479260	You know that we think that.
479260	485260	And then we go, naughty white guy, naughty white cop, naughty, just because it's hard.
485260	489260	You have to control yourself.
489260	494260	And then the 48-year-old white jogger with the towel gets shot and you're like, wait
494260	498260	a minute, how is my brain functioning?
498260	501260	This is all, what the fuck?
501260	503260	This is insane.
503260	505260	I don't know what to do about it.
505260	513260	But if you can't hold a towel and you can't be a white guy, all sympathies, I'm not going
514260	517260	to let you push my buttons and I'm not, I know that I'm making sense.
517260	520260	That's what you're pointing with this, though, right?
520260	523260	I guess you can skim that fucking hot button shit off the top of what I'm saying, but what
523260	526260	I'm really trying to do.
526260	530260	I think you could take a deep ladle full of that.
530260	533260	I said at the top of this conversation, I said, let's be racist.
533260	535260	Let's go to the racist list.
535260	538260	You said let me be racist, not let's all be racist.
538260	541260	A fine distinction.
541260	543260	Let me be racist.
543260	545260	Let me be racist.
545260	547260	Yes, I said that.
547260	553260	Let me be racist and say, why is that the deal breaker and why the fuck more importantly
553260	561260	if, because if we were giving a pass, were we giving a pass to cops in areas where white
561260	569260	people felt like maybe, maybe we felt like it was a demilitarized zone or we felt like,
569260	573260	you know, I'm liberal politically, but, hey, I can't imagine doing that job.
573260	575260	That must be real hard.
575260	579260	By the way, sanitation workers get killed more often than cops.
579260	583260	I don't deny, they just did a study.
583260	585260	How dangerous is this fucking job?
585260	587260	What is sanitation?
587260	589260	People murder them or they fall over it?
589260	591260	Let's not worry about sanitation workers.
591260	594260	The point is that, wait, no, wait.
594260	598260	Are people picking them off with guns from their rooftop or did they get crushed by a
598260	599260	gun?
599260	601260	Get out of my garbage!
601260	607260	It's, being mistaken for raccoons is like the highest cause of death in the United States
607260	609260	other than experimental aircraft.
609260	610260	I don't know.
610260	611260	I don't know.
611260	612260	I'm talking out of my ass.
612260	618260	That's why I built a cedar wood enclosure for my trash in front of my house.
618260	620260	And now I approve of that.
620260	626260	Now that I'm seeing the danger it causes.
626260	631260	That's Donnie Deepcut is giving you the high clap.
631260	636260	Anyways, I'm glad, come on, where was I?
636260	642260	I was being racist.
642260	648260	Now can we go, okay, so if you're a squad car and you're stuck in broad daylight traffic
648260	655260	on Los Feliz Boulevard where there's six yogurt shops within a mile radius and a 48-year-old
655260	662260	white jogger with a towel in his hands can also provoke the same response.
662260	665260	Can we definitely call it quits?
665260	669260	And if we use that as the deal breaker, can we just reveal that we've all been racist
669260	673260	and that maybe that's why this whole fucking problem exists in the first place?
673260	674260	That's my only point.
674260	677260	Because I'm willing to lay it bigger.
677260	680260	Are you saying that the deal for you wasn't broken yet?
680260	684260	That you still kind of consider, oh, that's a bad neighborhood full of black people.
684260	690260	I can see that it gave a byproduct of that job in that part of town.
690260	693260	I think the deal was broken a long time ago.
693260	696260	I think that, as I've always said, race is an artificial construct
696260	704260	and the thing that we're connecting is the idea that people that have phenotypical characteristics
704260	705260	all live on one block.
705260	709260	That's where things become what we're identifying as race issues
709260	712260	or class issues and cultural issues and stuff.
712260	717260	And so I think that within that maelstrom, yes, I will say to you, yes.
717260	721260	I have always thought in the back of my head, always in the back of my head,
721260	725260	I have always thought, boy, that can't be a good gig.
725260	730260	But is it also, does it have to be a race thing or can it just be a class thing?
730260	733260	Because we live in a neighborhood where that shooting took place.
733260	735260	The rent is very high there.
735260	740260	Is it possible that for you, because it's so close to where you actually live and you're safe?
740260	741260	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
741260	742260	So it's not a race thing, it's a class thing.
742260	745260	I'm saying there is no such thing as a race thing if we were to actually talk about genetics.
745260	747260	There's no such thing as a race thing.
747260	754260	The striation that we call racial, when I've said a thousand times on this stage,
754260	757260	race is an artificial construct, Dan, what do you mean by that?
757260	759260	What I mean is that it's a man-made construct.
759260	764260	The things that we delineate as racial are forced.
764260	768260	If you lived in a world, if you grew up in a high school
768260	772260	where all of the red-headed people sat at one lunch table,
772260	779260	if there were as much attention paid to freckles or the weird continuum of skin shades
779260	784260	that exist within what we consider African-American skin tones
784260	787260	and Middle Eastern skin tones and white skin tones,
787260	789260	everybody's skin has a different color to it.
789260	793260	Yes, there's genetic, there's these characteristics and things,
793260	796260	but compared to the things that actually make a difference,
796260	799260	it's an artificial construct, it's man-made.
799260	803260	When we're talking about racial things and racial hot buttons,
803260	806260	when we're talking about the actual existence of a black community,
806260	810260	we don't actually mean a bunch of people who are united by genetics alone.
810260	819260	That gets us into all kinds of trouble because that's really, really a huge sleight of hand.
819260	822260	We're talking about class and we're talking about the fact
822260	825260	that there's been these forced impositions.
825260	828260	We should have all been fucking each other a long time ago.
828260	832260	And I'm not saying that this is a necessity,
832260	838260	but statistically speaking, if there hadn't ever been any xenophobia
838260	840260	when anyone landed on the coast of anything,
840260	845260	if there had never been any imposition of any artificially asserted construct,
845260	849260	we would all just look like Holly Berry and Tiger Woods by now,
849260	854260	and Benjamin Bratt and whatever, and none of us would give a fuck.
854260	857260	And it's okay that that world hasn't happened yet.
857260	859260	We can still exist in that world because some people have long necks
859260	862260	and some people have big noses and some people have weird toes
862260	865260	and some people have shovel teeth and some people have...
865260	868260	And then some people are so desperate for identity
868260	870260	that they fucking carve up their own face.
870260	874260	So Jesus Christ, we don't have to be in such a hurry to all fuck each other,
874260	877260	but some people have tattoos and some people are in wheelchairs
877260	880260	and some people eat wood, termites, termites.
881260	884260	Those are termites. We don't have to include them.
886260	889260	Race is an artificial construct, is my point.
891260	893260	Oh, thanks, guys. That's been our show. Good night.
893260	895260	Thanks for coming, everybody.
895260	897260	Try safely.
897260	899260	Would you fuck a termite down if you could?
899260	902260	What do you think a human termite may be...
902260	907260	What would be the upside to a human termite crossbreeding?
908260	911260	Well, definitely the ability to digest wood.
913260	917260	I imagine all insects are totally jealous of termites, don't you?
917260	919260	They eat wood.
919260	922260	Like, imagine flies are like, fuck you!
922260	926260	They're on top of a turt and they're like, whoa!
926260	930260	Enjoy your log cabin, Thoreau!
930260	935260	The worst! The termites have got to...
935260	938260	How do they even do that?
938260	940260	It must be at the expense of something.
940260	943260	The termites must be terrible golfers or...
946260	948260	Dumb.
948260	950260	By the way, we're recording my comedy album tonight,
950260	954260	so thank you for laughing at my termite run.
955260	960260	What would the downside be of a human termite hybrid?
960260	968260	Probably no cardiovascular system of no brain,
968260	973260	just being a collection of neurons that make a thing go like this.
973260	979260	Spencer, if you could crossbreed humans with any animal or insect
979260	981260	from across the animal kingdom,
981260	984260	what do you think would be the most advantageous?
984260	986260	Oh, definitely an iguana.
988260	991260	Think about how useful an iguana is.
992260	997260	Now think about applying that skill set to the mental capacity of a human.
999260	1005260	You'd get humans that could lie on sticks or...
1005260	1009260	perhaps flat rocks.
1009260	1012260	Let him finish!
1013260	1016260	They'd even probably be able to eat mealworms.
1017260	1018260	I don't know.
1018260	1021260	I love that he left out changing color.
1021260	1023260	Iguanas, Dan.
1023260	1026260	I thought about saying chameleons didn't go there.
1026260	1028260	Oh, iguanas! I'm sorry.
1028260	1031260	Hey, look who's race blind.
1032260	1034260	Fuck you, people.
1035260	1038260	I hooked you in by saying I'm racist.
1040260	1043260	How does it feel on the lowest road compared to me,
1043260	1046260	where even iguanas and chameleons,
1047260	1050260	lizards famous for their color,
1050260	1053260	are indistinguishable to me?
1057260	1058260	Fuck you all.
1059260	1061260	The FBI is waiting at each exit.
1061260	1063260	You're all going on a racism list.
1064260	1066260	Because I'm the decoy.
1066260	1068260	I'm the guy, whatever they call him,
1068260	1071260	like in those kiddie porn...
1072260	1073260	Protégé.
1073260	1074260	Protégé?
1076260	1077260	Another callback.
1077260	1078260	Another callback.
1078260	1079260	In the movie, what was that?
1079260	1080260	There was a movie...
1080260	1081260	What was the movie with the...
1081260	1082260	God damn it.
1083260	1085260	Oh, honey pot? Is that it?
1086260	1089260	This is a sad thing to get clear.
1090260	1093260	The kid that they used to lure in other kids.
1093260	1095260	Deep cut, Donny, whatever his name is.
1095260	1096260	Deep cut.
1097260	1099260	Honey pot? Okay.
1101260	1102260	None of us feel better.
1102260	1104260	Oh, God, now I know.
1104260	1106260	I got all my pedophile terms down.
1107260	1109260	I'm glad I came out here tonight.
1109260	1111260	Could have been at the BET Awards,
1111260	1113260	but I'm a pedophile expert.
1115260	1116260	One more thing.
1116260	1117260	The Confederate flag thing.
1117260	1118260	I'm going to say one thing about it,
1118260	1119260	and then we're done.
1119260	1120260	We're going to meet some people.
1120260	1121260	We're going to have some fun.
1123260	1125260	Yes, scrutinize the flag.
1125260	1126260	Get it down.
1126260	1127260	You know why?
1127260	1128260	It's a fucking flag.
1128260	1131260	How less racist do you think the United States flag is?
1131260	1132260	All right, that's it.
1132260	1133260	That's all I wanted to say.
1134260	1136260	I just fucking get bummed out.
1136260	1137260	Are you kidding me?
1137260	1138260	Oh, really?
1138260	1141260	Because it's the logo for Dukes of Hazzard?
1141260	1143260	It makes such an easy target.
1143260	1145260	It's like, yeah, they lost, and they're like,
1145260	1148260	they should not be flying that over any capital building.
1148260	1151260	It's been tolerated in fucking sedition.
1151260	1152260	All flags are bummers.
1152260	1154260	Yeah, they're fucking flags.
1154260	1157260	It's like, yeah, fucking let's be...
1157260	1158260	Also, we fold it weird.
1158260	1160260	That's a stupid way to fold anything.
1160260	1161260	We fold it weird.
1161260	1163260	We fold it weird.
1163260	1165260	And we have a bunch of weird rules about it.
1165260	1167260	A fucking triangle?
1167260	1168260	That's a stupid...
1168260	1176260	Every single flag on this entire planet is by its very nature.
1176260	1180260	The whole reason to have a flag is to, like...
1180260	1183260	Fold it in a square or rectangle.
1183260	1184260	We'll get to...
1184260	1187260	But the idea of taking a piece of fabric and saying,
1187260	1190260	this is a symbol and we're waving it,
1190260	1193260	that's how all dehumanization begins.
1193260	1194260	So, yeah, have them.
1194260	1195260	They're fine.
1195260	1196260	They're great.
1196260	1197260	They scrutinize some of them.
1197260	1198260	Hey, that one's the loser's flag.
1198260	1199260	Let's take it down.
1199260	1202260	Didn't they lose a long time ago?
1202260	1203260	We should probably put that in a museum
1203260	1206260	instead of over our government building.
1206260	1209260	It's kind of weird that we keep letting them do that.
1209260	1215260	If you put a flag up over a southern city's capital building
1215260	1219260	that said Jeff Davis Rules, people would show up at your door.
1219260	1221260	Well, first off, they'd be right.
1221260	1224260	Second.
1224260	1226260	My name, Jeff Davis, Jefferson Davis,
1226260	1228260	the president of the Confederacy.
1228260	1230260	Oh, boy.
1230260	1235260	No, every week somebody sends me a tweet of them being in the south
1235260	1238260	and a bumper sticker or a sticker on a lamppost that says,
1238260	1242260	don't blame me, I voted for Jeff Davis across the Confederate Jack.
1242260	1245260	Like, there's loads of good old racist Jeff Davis,
1245260	1247260	my name across the Confederate flag.
1247260	1252260	We thought you were going to tell the Teen Wolf story again.
1252260	1253260	I'm kidding. I'm doing it.
1253260	1256260	Deep Cut Townie knows what I'm talking about.
1256260	1258260	No, Deep Cut Townie fucking gas-faced me.
1258260	1262260	I did tell the story about my name profiting me in the south, right?
1262260	1264260	Yes, that's what I thought you were doing.
1264260	1265260	That's why I said, oh, boy.
1265260	1268260	I didn't want you to go on that record track.
1268260	1270260	I'll fucking talk about Teen Wolf though, man.
1270260	1271260	Don't do either.
1271260	1275260	Let's freshen things up with a long-awaited guest,
1275260	1277260	somebody who should have been here a long time ago,
1277260	1280260	partly because it's basically, well, I mean, not basically,
1280260	1283260	literally, she's the reason why the podcast exists,
1283260	1289260	because years ago at The Roost, she was just very like,
1289260	1292260	she wasn't assertive about it, she was just sort of clear about it,
1292260	1294260	said like, you should have a podcast.
1294260	1295260	You should do a podcast.
1295260	1299260	And I was like, oh, yeah, maybe I should.
1299260	1301260	Her benefits extend beyond that.
1301260	1305260	A lot of you already love her from The Indoor Kids
1305260	1308260	and all kinds of stuff, and she's got a book that's coming out
1308260	1310260	that we'll plug, but let's get to talking to her.
1310260	1311260	Emily Gordon's here.
1311260	1312260	Yeah!
1322260	1325260	Hello.
1325260	1326260	Hi.
1326260	1328260	Hi, Emily.
1328260	1329260	Hello.
1329260	1330260	Emily Vance Gordon.
1330260	1331260	Vance, that's right.
1331260	1333260	You got a cool middle name.
1333260	1334260	I hate that middle name.
1334260	1335260	Why?
1335260	1338260	It was supposed to be my first name if I was going to be a boy,
1338260	1341260	and I wasn't, because I don't think anybody
1341260	1342260	would have sex with someone named Vance,
1342260	1344260	so I'm quite happy about that.
1344260	1346260	But middle name status, I'll take it.
1346260	1347260	It's fine.
1347260	1348260	Yeah.
1348260	1349260	Emily Vance.
1349260	1350260	So they loved the name so much, they couldn't let it go,
1350260	1351260	even though you were a woman.
1351260	1353260	It must be in here somewhere.
1353260	1355260	I'm lucky I didn't get one of those forename people.
1355260	1356260	You know the forename people?
1356260	1357260	It's not good.
1357260	1358260	What?
1358260	1360260	I have kind of an equally charming story.
1360260	1362260	My parents didn't expect a third child,
1362260	1364260	so they made up a name.
1364260	1365260	Dan?
1365260	1366260	Did they make up Dan?
1366260	1367260	Yeah.
1367260	1369260	You guys, the creator of Dan.
1369260	1372260	I just grabbed it, rolled me under a porch.
1372260	1375260	So I want to start with one of the most,
1375260	1379260	I think this kind of exemplifies you in my mind,
1379260	1382260	my relationship with you, your role, and my cosmos.
1382260	1386260	I'm constantly retweeting you, things that you just retweet.
1386260	1389260	It's not like you're out there aggressively asserting yourself,
1389260	1392260	but like Graham Linehan, who we had on the show.
1393260	1394260	Oh, he's so great on Twitter.
1394260	1397260	And particularly through the things he retweets.
1397260	1402260	Just by looking at his retweets, I feel like a smarter person,
1402260	1405260	and I also feel like a much dumber person.
1405260	1409260	But your stuff, the stuff that you retweet,
1409260	1412260	is like the emotional equivalent of that.
1412260	1419260	The most exemplary one was you simply retweeted a Tumblr.
1419260	1421260	Now, was this something that you wrote, or was this something that...
1421260	1423260	No, it was something in somebody else's shirt that I just saw
1423260	1425260	and retumbled and therefore retweeted.
1425260	1426260	It was...
1426260	1428260	God, I hate myself.
1428260	1430260	Just having to say that sentence out loud.
1430260	1431260	I'm not fond of myself.
1431260	1432260	We all died a little bit.
1432260	1434260	Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
1434260	1439260	It was simply a list of ways to compliment people.
1439260	1441260	I don't want to get this wrong.
1441260	1445260	List of ways to compliment people without involving their physical appearance.
1445260	1447260	Their appearance. Yeah, that's it. That was it.
1448260	1451260	Nice things you can say to people other than how they look.
1451260	1452260	Yeah.
1456260	1464260	My brain flipped over because this is something I should have realized a long time ago.
1464260	1467260	It's beyond gender politics.
1467260	1471260	It's beyond, but it certainly afflicts probably, if I were to guess,
1471260	1476260	probably afflicts the female self-esteem a little more than the half of the species
1476260	1479260	is allowed to look like this.
1479260	1481260	What were a couple that you remember or anything?
1481260	1484260	You know what? Fuck it. No, I didn't even read it.
1486260	1489260	Based on the title alone, you were like, yes.
1489260	1491260	This speaks to me. It resonates.
1491260	1494260	But that's the... Well, that's an important thing.
1494260	1497260	So the piece is a... Think about this.
1497260	1500260	This is a piece that made my mind flop.
1500260	1505260	A hundred and eighty degrees about some part of my brain just reshuffled completely.
1505260	1508260	And there was no outrage.
1508260	1514260	There was no lynching. There was no anger. There was no shaming.
1514260	1517260	Even comedically and all those comedy people.
1517260	1520260	That's how we express our progress as we...
1520260	1522260	Bitch about things.
1522260	1524260	Your husband's the best at it.
1524260	1526260	He's so good, you guys. He's fucking great.
1526260	1529260	He's like Lancelot. He's out there like slashing.
1529260	1532260	He complains on a constant basis.
1532260	1537260	That's what we do. That's as progressive as comedy and comedy writers get.
1537260	1541260	We stab and we poke at the things that we don't like.
1541260	1544260	But this was a thing that was like, hey,
1544260	1549260	here's a list of things you could say to somebody that you like,
1549260	1552260	that have nothing to do with their physical appearance.
1552260	1555260	And there was no victimization. There was no nothing.
1555260	1558260	I would name a couple of them, things that you could say.
1558260	1561260	I don't remember a goddamn one and I don't have to.
1561260	1564260	I enjoy the way your voice sounds.
1564260	1568260	What do you love hearing that from somebody, you guys?
1568260	1570260	I think it was stuff like I like how your voice sounds.
1570260	1573260	I enjoy the work that you did on that thing.
1573260	1575260	Just very kind of random things.
1575260	1577260	I enjoy spending time with you.
1577260	1579260	You make me feel better about myself.
1579260	1583260	Just like a genuine, vulnerable expression of like,
1583260	1585260	this is something you do that I like.
1585260	1587260	That's kind of a rarity.
1587260	1591260	You scare me less than other people.
1591260	1594260	You make me feel like dancing.
1594260	1596260	I'm going to dance the night away.
1596260	1600260	I want to dance with somebody who loves me, obviously.
1600260	1603260	I'm your private dancer.
1603260	1605260	A dancer for money?
1605260	1606260	A dancer for money.
1606260	1608260	Well, you do what I want you to do.
1608260	1612260	Don't make it about yourself. Make it about her.
1612260	1615260	These are our dance hall days.
1616260	1617260	You're just scrambling now.
1617260	1619260	Everybody weighing chung tonight?
1619260	1621260	Can we weigh chung?
1621260	1624260	I just feel like a lot of times the stuff I see in Tumblr specifically,
1624260	1627260	if you spend any time on it, it's just people full of hate and rage,
1627260	1630260	like college rage, which is a very specific rage.
1630260	1633260	And I was like, when you're telling,
1633260	1636260	this is fucked up when this happens and this should be happening instead,
1636260	1638260	then all people want to talk about is this is what's fucked up.
1638260	1640260	And they're like, well, that's not fucked up.
1640260	1642260	You don't understand. You weren't there. You don't know.
1642260	1643260	Let me explain it to you, little lady.
1643260	1645260	So I'm like, I would rather just skip to the second part,
1645260	1648260	which is putting out good stuff and being like, well, then just take this.
1648260	1651260	What is the goal? What is the end game that we want?
1651260	1654260	We want to be happy supposedly, right?
1654260	1656260	We want to be satisfied.
1656260	1660260	Supposedly when you're like, when you're charging at a guy on Twitter
1660260	1662260	and you're like fucking like lancing him.
1662260	1663260	Yeah.
1663260	1668260	In theory, like in plain sight theory, the theory we all accept,
1668260	1670260	which I don't know. Is it true?
1670260	1675260	Is that you behind all of that force is revolution.
1675260	1680260	And the name of the revolution is can't we all just get along now?
1680260	1682260	Is it though? I don't even know.
1682260	1686260	Yeah. If your flag is, can't we all just get along?
1686260	1687260	That's a fucked up flag too.
1687260	1691260	Why under that flag are you slitting people's throats?
1691260	1695260	No matter how racist they are, no matter how much, how, how, like,
1695260	1698260	like, like, when are we going to get to this revolution where we are, where we go?
1698260	1703260	Like, let's start. It's more boring, but let's start setting the example.
1703260	1706260	It's so much more boring. It's fucking terrible, really.
1706260	1713260	And it's really hard to think of a positive way to incite subversive thought.
1713260	1719260	But another, another, I mean, I've referenced it numerous times on this podcast.
1719260	1720260	I think you retweeted.
1720260	1725260	It was the blog entry, the article that was Admit It Your Fave is Problematic.
1725260	1727260	Yes. That was a great one.
1727260	1729260	I thought there was such a gracious invitation within there.
1729260	1734260	It was like such a beacon of light within a generation that I am so, like, shaking my cane at all the time.
1734260	1742260	But I was like, oh, this is the thing that I'm looking for is the idea that can we acknowledge that humanity is so flawed
1742260	1746260	that if we are going to clean up this porch, that it is going to involve touching dirt.
1746260	1747260	So much dirt.
1747260	1752260	And if we all go ick every time we touch dirt and point at it and scream, dirt, dirt, dirt,
1752260	1756260	we're going to be able to fucking clean children on a dirty porch shrieking at each other.
1756260	1760260	It's, it's weird. We don't ever get to have.
1760260	1761260	Works.
1761260	1764260	We don't ever get to have conversations about anything because it's true.
1764260	1768260	When you start, if you even start, people are like, well, here's why what you said is problematic.
1768260	1774260	And then there's no conversations that are going to move anyone anywhere because it's all like, how fast can I shut you down?
1774260	1776260	How quickly can I shut you down and then shame you?
1776260	1779260	And then we don't get to move in any direction from there.
1779260	1785260	How much of the shame and the like hate or like, you know, trolling do you get that simply because you're a woman?
1785260	1789260	It's actually me saying this is going to make it happen more.
1789260	1792260	So be aware of that.
1792260	1796260	I actually don't. It's not that bad. It's really not that bad for me.
1796260	1801260	And it also makes me mad when people are like, you're one of the good ones, like one of the good feminists.
1801260	1804260	And I'm like the Jimi Hendrix.
1804260	1808260	And I want to be one of the bad ones, you fucking asshole.
1808260	1811260	Don't ever tell me I'm one of the good ones because you'll see me become the bad one.
1811260	1817260	But yeah, because you project yourself, you seem to have a pretty sane approach to how you do stuff.
1817260	1823260	I try to. And when I talk about like sex or something, like I always get I'll like say something about giving a blowjob or something.
1823260	1826260	And people would be like, that's so cool that you talk about that.
1826260	1831260	And you're feminist. I'm like, yeah, all of the blowjob.
1831260	1834260	All of them.
1834260	1839260	How much power do you have when you have a man's genitals in your fucking mouth?
1839260	1846260	That is power. You definitely you definitely.
1846260	1849260	Thank you.
1849260	1852260	You do not want to blowjob from a non-feminist.
1852260	1855260	It's the worst.
1855260	1859260	It's probably all teeth.
1859260	1862260	But but related to that, like here's another anecdotal thing.
1862260	1878260	But I also like we're coming so close to which I think is beautiful is bridging this from societal stuff and digital stuff to couples stuff because your your original wheelhouse is you actually you're you're an expatriate from the were you a couples therapist?
1878260	1880260	I was a couples and family therapist.
1880260	1881260	And you fled.
1881260	1883260	I ran fast.
1883260	1888260	Which makes you more trustworthy as a therapist than than anybody who stayed.
1888260	1893260	But I was a therapist for I practiced for almost about six and a half, almost seven years.
1893260	1900260	And I really loved it. But I chose to work with really tough populations and really tough populations will burn you the fuck out.
1900260	1904260	So I was like, I tried to take a job working with people who were just like, I feel stressed out.
1904260	1907260	And I was like, fuck you. You have no idea how good you have it.
1907260	1909260	And then I was like, oh, I got to get out of here.
1909260	1911260	This is my my fault now.
1911260	1914260	What do you mean when you say tough population?
1914260	1921260	I worked. My first job was with kids who had been removed from their home and their next step was going to be to put in training school, which is like bye bye until you're 18.
1921260	1923260	And then my next job was with only suicidal people.
1923260	1928260	My next job was with 270 people with schizophrenia who are living in a house or hotel.
1928260	1931260	That's how Freddy Krueger got born.
1931260	1935260	The bastard child of a thousand thousand maniacs.
1935260	1937260	Yeah, that's how sperm works, right?
1937260	1941260	We all we all learned in Dream Warriors.
1941260	1947260	Which by the way, that sperm is like a slushy.
1947260	1955260	Like if a thousand crazy people rape one nun, it makes Freddy Krueger with their combined sperm.
1955260	1957260	That's irresponsible.
1957260	1960260	It's like a gay couple where they're like, we don't want to know which one it really was.
1960260	1963260	We just want it to be all of our kids together.
1964260	1966260	And some of them are like, he's got my eyes, though.
1966260	1969260	I think it's mine.
1969260	1973260	He has my proclivity for knife fingering.
1973260	1976260	Yeah, he's got all my burnt flesh.
1976260	1982260	Part of me really wants because I think if somebody people are listening, they could benefit.
1982260	1988260	Because what you just said earlier was that you actually have an easier time.
1988260	1993260	And I think it's not an incorrect assumption that that has something to do with inside you.
1993260	1997260	That you you know how to handle things better.
1997260	2003260	So therefore, I'm curious that for all of us out there who are living on Twitter, living in social media comment sections,
2003260	2009260	getting into these tangles that jack up our nervous system and all of a sudden we're just like like,
2009260	2015260	I mean, what do you do in these very typical situations that maybe some of us aren't doing?
2015260	2016260	Okay, that's a good question.
2016260	2018260	I would say and I'm not always great at it.
2018260	2022260	If you catch me on a weird day, I'll fucking yell at you for no reason and then apologize later.
2022260	2024260	And that's the thing I've learned.
2024260	2029260	One is that what I don't want to have to do is apologize to someone who is a little shitty to me when I blow up later.
2029260	2030260	And then I'm like, you're right.
2030260	2031260	I'm sorry.
2031260	2032260	I said something shitty.
2032260	2034260	I don't want to have to apologize to you.
2034260	2035260	Fuck off.
2035260	2037260	So I that's my first line of defense.
2037260	2040260	Second line of defense is going, what do I really want out of this?
2040260	2044260	Like genuinely, what is the ideal outcome of this situation for me?
2044260	2047260	And is there any chance in fucking hell that I'm going to get it?
2047260	2051260	And if there's just not, then I just choose not to engage.
2051260	2054260	Like there's no there's no point to me.
2054260	2060260	Like if what I want is I want you to stop being racist and sexist and understand how I feel about things.
2060260	2062260	I'm not going to do that over Twitter.
2062260	2063260	Yeah.
2063260	2065260	And why would you want that for some dude?
2065260	2069260	Like what kind of weird dead man walking relationship is that?
2069260	2072260	Or you're just going to be Susan Saran into one guy on Twitter.
2072260	2074260	You're the one I've decided.
2074260	2076260	I will change you.
2076260	2080260	And for so many, I think women too, we take on project dudes to date.
2080260	2087260	And so taking on project dudes on Twitter, I feel like it's like a weird extension of that of like taking on like, I will make you better.
2087260	2091260	I will be the special one that will understand you and make you.
2091260	2092260	It's not my job.
2092260	2093260	It could be.
2093260	2094260	I think we're all afflicted to that.
2094260	2097260	But by it though, like because we all want to.
2097260	2101260	So what I'm hearing and combining with the tools I'm acquiring in therapy right now.
2102260	2104260	Just the fact that you said what I'm hearing is good stuff.
2104260	2105260	Good.
2107260	2109260	By the way, you look fantastic tonight.
2109260	2110260	Fuck.
2110260	2111260	Fuck.
2111260	2112260	Fuck.
2112260	2113260	Fuck.
2113260	2115260	Emily, is Camille a project dude?
2115260	2116260	Of course.
2116260	2117260	Of course he is.
2117260	2118260	No.
2118260	2121260	Oh, I shouldn't have answered for you.
2121260	2123260	It just seems so obvious.
2123260	2125260	No, not at all.
2125260	2127260	I mean, thank God he's not here tonight.
2127260	2129260	No, he's not backstage staring at me right now.
2129260	2130260	No, not at all.
2130260	2133260	He was one of the first guys I dated that did not need me to function.
2133260	2137260	And so that was why he was terrifying, but also why I fell in love with him.
2137260	2141260	Just to link, not to beat this dead horse, but just because I do think that people listening
2141260	2147260	could benefit from this because we're interacting all the time just in these little digital bursts.
2147260	2156260	Would you say that then one of the differences between your type of interaction with trolls,
2156260	2157260	let's call them.
2157260	2161260	Like, do you primarily, do you do a lot of just blocking, ignoring?
2161260	2162260	I do some blocking.
2162260	2163260	Yeah.
2163260	2164260	I try to think like, what do I want?
2164260	2169580	And if what I want is to make this guy feel shame or bad, then I'm like, I need to find
2169580	2173700	another way to make, I, there are other ways to affect someone's emotions that don't evolve.
2173700	2176500	Cause some days you just want to make other people feel bad.
2176500	2177500	You feel bad.
2177500	2181260	You want to fucking spread it around, but just be honest with your own intentions.
2181260	2182260	Right.
2182260	2184540	Like, you were like, no, no, no, I want to educate him about fifth-weight feminism.
2184540	2185540	No, you don't.
2185540	2186940	You want to fucking make him feel bad.
2186940	2187940	You want to make him feel bad.
2187940	2188940	Cause he made you feel bad.
2188940	2189940	You don't want to educate him.
2189940	2192060	You don't give a fuck if he's educated.
2192060	2195100	Just be honest with that desire within yourself.
2195100	2196100	And then also think about him.
2196100	2197100	What does he want?
2197100	2198660	He wants to make you feel bad.
2198660	2199860	Are you going to let him have that?
2199860	2203860	That's a lot of power to give somebody a stranger who has an egg for a fucking face.
2203860	2207060	I'm not going to do that.
2207060	2208060	Yeah.
2208060	2213100	I feel like I have like incidentally, like going to therapy and then as a direct result
2213100	2216620	of therapy, I adopted this new thing, which is, which I never would have done before.
2216620	2220380	I actually, when I started on Twitter, I thought that blocking people was like some
2220380	2222020	kind of admission of defeat.
2222020	2223020	You won?
2223020	2224020	Yeah.
2224020	2226180	Like, like, like, no, I can fucking take anybody down.
2226180	2227180	Come at me.
2227180	2228180	Like, I'm Steven Seagal.
2228180	2229180	What does that even mean?
2229180	2230180	Take them down.
2230180	2231180	What does that even mean?
2231180	2234580	I mean, I'll tell you what it means because I'm still, part of me is like, like, no, I
2234580	2236780	want you to understand how good I am.
2236780	2241780	It means they block me and I was fucking good at it.
2241780	2245260	Like I would, I would, that was my, that was my zero sum game.
2245260	2248300	Like for real, for three years, I would, that was my game.
2248300	2250460	Like I would, people would come at me and they'd go like, community sucks.
2250460	2252580	And I'd be like, all right, let's talk for a while.
2252580	2256540	Three weeks later, they're blocking me and I'm like coming out and I'm going, Hey, hey,
2256540	2260580	I thought you wanted to talk motherfucker.
2260580	2261580	That's me winning.
2261580	2262580	Unhealthy, unhealthy, unhealthy.
2262580	2263580	Meanwhile community, they're like, Hey, where's Dan?
2263580	2264580	Oh, I don't know.
2264580	2265580	I think he's talking with him.
2265580	2266580	I'm like, why do you draw like an eight year old?
2266580	2267580	Does it cause your dad left?
2267580	2278780	And they're just like crying and like fucking like, I just fantasize about their suicide.
2278780	2281380	I don't, don't commit suicide.
2281380	2282380	Talk to somebody.
2282380	2284380	There's a number you can call.
2284380	2289100	So, but, but, so in therapy, because of the stuff I learned, then I just like applied
2289100	2290100	that.
2290100	2293780	I never talked to my therapist about Twitter specifically, but I, but I applied the tools
2293780	2297300	that I was learning in therapy to like, you are applying tools.
2297300	2298300	You've learned elsewhere.
2298300	2299300	What a great color you are.
2299300	2303620	And I, I'm assuming you think I look great, but won't tell me because you're so advanced.
2303620	2304620	I'll tell you later.
2304620	2305620	Off mic.
2305620	2308500	I feel like if somebody came up to me and said, uh, you know what?
2308500	2311060	I really liked the sound of your talking voice.
2311060	2312060	That's what I'm saying.
2312060	2313060	You look like shit.
2313060	2317940	I think I can't think of anything to say nice about the way you look with, with all your
2317940	2318940	respect to Emily.
2318940	2323900	I think that I think the sound of your voice one was a bad first example because it's kind
2323900	2324900	of as physical.
2324900	2325900	It's like, that's true.
2325900	2328020	Because then someone else was like, what about me?
2328020	2329020	Yeah.
2329020	2332460	And really that's, they just have an ugly throat.
2332460	2333460	Could you?
2333460	2334460	That's a great voice.
2334460	2337860	But more importantly, if you're Foxy and all people do is tell you you're Foxy, that's
2337860	2340660	actually the more important battleground lately lately.
2340660	2341940	You should be anyways.
2341940	2343500	So let's get to that later.
2343500	2346300	Cause you, you've, you're writing a book about, you're, you're about to come out with a book
2346300	2347300	about a self-esteem.
2347300	2348300	Yeah.
2348300	2349300	I want to talk about that.
2349300	2350300	But, but fuck you.
2350300	2351300	Um, fuck you all.
2351300	2352300	There was one more thing.
2352300	2355180	I just wanted to brag about how, uh, how advanced you are.
2355180	2358180	Uh, I started, I started blocking people.
2358180	2359660	I started just fucking blocking people.
2359660	2361580	I started, I started eating it like Rice Krispies.
2361580	2364300	I was like, I was just like, once I crossed the threshold, I was like, block the first
2364300	2365300	guy.
2365300	2366860	It's like block, block, block, block, block.
2366860	2368340	Do you know what the result is?
2368340	2372220	Like I mean, for better or for worse, when I get on Twitter now, it's like fucking so
2372220	2377420	positive because, because, because either people are terrorized, like they, they're
2377420	2382020	like, dude, don't fucking, if you ask him about community's lighting in season six, he'll
2382020	2386420	fucking block you like, like, like, like, and maybe, hey, fuck it.
2386420	2390580	Maybe I'm, maybe I'm, yeah, maybe I'm Caligula on Twitter, but, but, but more importantly,
2390580	2394100	I'm getting on Twitter for my own experience of like, I have a good time on Twitter now.
2394100	2397780	I have intelligent, smart, funny people.
2397780	2401220	I say like, I'm watching this movie and like people are writing and going like, I watched
2401220	2402220	that movie.
2402220	2403220	Did you watch this movie?
2403220	2404220	And it's like fucking, that's what Twitter's for.
2404220	2405220	That's what it's supposed to be for.
2405220	2406220	Yeah.
2406220	2409460	And it's, and it's because I just started like popping those fucking bubbles, like it
2409460	2411260	is like lancing those boils.
2411260	2412860	It's like, this is not what I get on Twitter for.
2412860	2417140	I don't get on here for constructive criticism about, about season three.
2417140	2419620	Do you feel like, uh, like Joseph Stalin felt the same way?
2419620	2426860	Like when he was, yes, Jeff, as I've always said, when he was killing off tens of millions
2426860	2435780	of people, that dissented with the way he blocked them with the, the orders to the Gestapo,
2435780	2439300	he would say, block them.
2439300	2440300	Stalin was dealing with the Gestapo.
2440340	2441340	Yeah.
2441340	2442340	He was in deep.
2442340	2443340	That's hard.
2443340	2444580	That is hard.
2444580	2445900	No one knows about that.
2445900	2447500	No one knows.
2447500	2450940	Is it because Gestapo is like, because they all got blocked and you're like, you taste
2450940	2451940	it.
2451940	2452940	You're like, the soup is cold.
2452940	2453940	And they're like, it's Gestapo.
2453940	2454940	It's supposed to be cold.
2454940	2462020	The, I dropped out of college, I dropped out of college.
2462020	2466020	We have this beautiful segue here because we're talking about like, was the, the individual
2466020	2471060	working with this human biomass digitally.
2471060	2476100	And we're talking about the same tools, uh, and your former occupation as that we're,
2476100	2481620	we're, we're talking about two people who join and in partnership and your husband is
2481620	2482620	here and my wife is here.
2482620	2484620	I think we should just bring them both out at the same time.
2484620	2485620	Okay.
2485620	2488620	Let's grab Camille and, uh, Aaron McGathey.
2488620	2494220	Camille and Antioni everybody.
2494220	2497060	And Aaron McGathey.
2497060	2498060	Hi.
2498060	2499060	Hello.
2499060	2501060	Hi everybody.
2501060	2502060	Welcome.
2502060	2507900	Thank you for having me on your show.
2507900	2508900	You're welcome.
2508900	2509900	It's my face.
2509900	2512580	We got to change it to my face up here.
2512580	2514980	And I will say just quickly, I never, here's what I said.
2514980	2519580	I, I was picked to run this theater, uh, when it first opened and I was really needed
2519580	2521020	shows and really needed good things.
2521020	2524740	And we happened to be at the bar one night and I was like, you should just come and talk
2524740	2527220	on stage for like an hour.
2527220	2538140	I think it would be amazing if people would come and you were like, make it to, that really
2538140	2542700	is like Dan and I went to drawing room and Dan and I were sitting at the bar, the drawing
2542700	2547140	room, Dan's like, yeah, I talked to, uh, Emily Gordon, uh, who works at meltdown.
2547140	2550180	And he, uh, she said, but we should do a show.
2550180	2553340	So maybe we just get up there and we just talk and we talk about going to the moon.
2553340	2554340	And that was it.
2554340	2557180	That was literally, and the first show, if you'll remember, you wanted to show something
2557180	2559180	on screen and our screen wasn't working.
2559180	2563180	So when the show was supposed to be starting, I was at the Apple store at the gallery.
2563180	2565260	I think at the Glendale Galleria, no, not Glendale.
2565260	2570580	I was whatever, not interesting, uh, trying to find a part to go to the screen so that
2570580	2571580	you could show this thing.
2571580	2573220	And when I got back, you were like, yeah, fuck it.
2573220	2574220	We just won't show it.
2574220	2575220	And I was like, all right.
2575220	2576220	Let's do this.
2576220	2580180	And that was, sorry, which, which mall was it?
2580180	2587140	The gallery is so close to the Americana for you.
2587140	2589020	I did not call you a project man earlier.
2589020	2591020	How dare you call it with your eyes.
2591020	2592020	Project dude.
2592020	2593020	What are you talking about?
2593020	2596340	I was totally still am a project guy.
2596340	2598340	You're also a project lady.
2598980	2601340	We're all projects on this earth.
2601340	2605340	We're, we're on a rock hurtling through space.
2605340	2606980	Do not damn harm in this, Camille.
2606980	2607980	You were not able to do it.
2607980	2610900	I mean, it's so nice to, Camille, it's so nice to see you.
2610900	2612820	I appreciate what a project you are.
2612820	2613820	Yeah.
2615180	2616180	Thank you.
2616180	2618780	Camille, you look fantastic tonight, man.
2618780	2619780	You do.
2619780	2620780	Thank you.
2620780	2621780	I like your voice.
2621780	2622780	Wow.
2623780	2624780	Wow.
2624780	2627780	I mean, if only the show was an hour.
2627780	2628780	Right.
2628780	2629780	That's a fucking closer.
2629780	2630780	That's a closer.
2630780	2633780	I'll end it right fucking now.
2633780	2634780	I will end this thing.
2634780	2635780	But that's a good segue.
2635780	2636780	Let's talk about that.
2636780	2638780	So we got two, we got two married couples up here.
2638780	2640780	What I've learned in couples therapy and in solo therapy,
2640780	2646780	both the same therapist is this, this, this new epiphany that I've gotten is so
2646780	2650780	everyone in the world, every experience that you have, like, like, imagine
2651780	2656780	yourself just covered in buttons, you know, you just get buttons pushed and
2656780	2658780	they're, they're, they're your deal and stuff.
2658780	2662780	The, the, the, the most important thing about it though, is that you marry the
2662780	2665780	person who pushes most of your buttons.
2665780	2667780	They push, they push like the exciting ones.
2667780	2668780	Okay.
2668780	2669780	So the buttons are good and bad.
2669780	2670780	Yeah.
2670780	2671780	Okay.
2671780	2672780	Good.
2672780	2673780	No, there's good buttons, bad buttons.
2673780	2674780	You're like, you're really pushing my buttons.
2674780	2675780	That's never good.
2675780	2676780	Yeah.
2676780	2677780	Okay.
2677780	2678780	Well, maybe I need a different metaphor.
2678780	2679780	Flipping your switches.
2679780	2680780	Okay.
2680780	2682780	But like the people that the people that you couple with are people.
2682780	2684780	It's like, it's like not to bring it into a religious place, but they're
2684780	2690780	invitations from the cosmos for you to evolve beyond what you would have been
2690780	2693780	because you could have just lived to 30 and then just fucking fell over.
2693780	2694780	Sure.
2694780	2697780	And, and, and, and, hey, that would have been a fine life, better than a caterpillar
2697780	2698780	and fucked your ass.
2700780	2705780	But as human beings who live 70 years or 90 in women's case.
2707780	2708780	Whoa.
2708780	2709780	Sorry.
2709780	2710780	I guess it's fine.
2710780	2711780	You look great.
2714780	2719780	The, the, it's like the second half of an important life is maybe I'm biased
2719780	2723780	because I'm married, but it's like, it's, it's, it's joining with this person
2723780	2728780	that affects you way more than strangers on Twitter, way more than good reviews
2728780	2732780	or bad reviews of your television show, way more than anything.
2732780	2736780	And so you're making an agreement not to wake up every morning and go hubba hubba.
2736780	2737780	What's going on?
2737780	2739780	Let's go, let's go on a roller coaster.
2739780	2742780	You're making an agreement to wake up in the, in bed with, every morning with
2742780	2748780	somebody that's like, this fucking person is goddamn fucking like Jesus, powerful.
2748780	2752780	Lately, like this, this person is, what did Greg Proops say about his wife?
2752780	2753780	How does he describe her?
2753780	2754780	Formidable.
2754780	2755780	Yeah.
2755780	2757780	This person is formidable.
2757780	2760780	But I think that's true of some marriages, but then some marriages aren't like that
2760780	2761780	at all.
2761780	2763780	Some marriages are just like, we're good friends and we've decided to hang out
2763780	2764780	for the rest of my lives.
2764780	2765780	Fuck those assholes.
2765780	2766780	Yeah.
2766780	2767780	No, no, no.
2767780	2768780	No, fuck those.
2768780	2770780	You're definitely very formidable.
2770780	2772780	I think, I like to say, I know you challenged me.
2772780	2773780	I like to think I challenge you.
2773780	2774780	We do.
2774780	2775780	Yes.
2775780	2776780	We sort of, yeah.
2776780	2779780	It's been, because that's what you were saying was when every relationship I've
2779780	2782780	been in, I felt like I had the power.
2782780	2783780	Yes.
2783780	2784780	Same with you.
2784780	2785780	Yes.
2785780	2787780	I was, I steamrolled every guy that I was with forever.
2787780	2788780	Yeah.
2788780	2789780	And then you would not allow me to do that.
2789780	2792780	Is that because you, as a therapist, you have all that, like.
2792780	2793780	She's got all the tricks.
2793780	2794780	You have all the jujitsu and like.
2794780	2795780	Yeah.
2795780	2796780	And she's a blowjob feminist.
2796780	2797780	So.
2797780	2798780	God damn it.
2798780	2802780	I was going to say, steamroll is euphemism for a feminist blowjob.
2802780	2803780	Yeah.
2803780	2804780	That's not hurt.
2804780	2805780	That's not hurt.
2805780	2806780	But.
2806780	2807780	Right?
2807780	2808780	Yeah.
2808780	2811780	But I think that in our relationship, nobody has.
2811780	2812780	Nobody's in charge.
2812780	2816780	I hope after the show, there's just a bunch of feminist blowjobs out in the parking lots
2816780	2817780	in there.
2817780	2820780	Swallow it, ladies.
2820780	2822780	Men can be feminists.
2822780	2823780	For Gertrude Stein.
2823780	2824780	That's as much.
2824780	2825780	You guys.
2825780	2829780	Did you say holler or swallow?
2829780	2830780	Swallow.
2830780	2831780	Swallow!
2831780	2832780	Swallow!
2832780	2833780	Swallow!
2833780	2834780	Swallow!
2834780	2835780	Swallow!
2835780	2836780	Swallow!
2836780	2837780	Swallow!
2837780	2838780	Swallow!
2838780	2839780	Swallow!
2839780	2840780	Swallow!
2840780	2841780	Swallow!
2841780	2842780	Swallow!
2842780	2843780	Swallow!
2843780	2844780	Swallow!
2844780	2845780	Swallow!
2845780	2846780	Swallow!
2846780	2847780	Do you guys, do you guys think now that we're moving forward into a world where marriage
2847780	2848780	just means marriage.
2848780	2849780	That you will have sex with us, because the stage picture would imply that we're about
2849780	2850780	to initiate a, no?
2850780	2851780	What's the shit?
2851780	2852780	What are you talking about?
2852780	2853780	Is that what you...
2853780	2854780	No, no, no.
2854780	2855780	Is that what you...
2855780	2856780	No, I mean...
2856780	2859780	If gay people can be married, then we can fuck a million people.
2859780	2860780	Yeah.
2860780	2861780	We can fuck anybody we want.
2861780	2864980	This is purely, this is purely a visual thing, but because Dan and I are on either side
2864980	2866980	of you, and we're talking about your love life.
2866980	2867980	Have some more wine, yeah.
2867980	2868980	Just take a cab.
2868980	2869980	That's not fun.
2869980	2870980	It's a night of no mistakes.
2870980	2871980	No judgment.
2871980	2872980	It's difficult.
2872980	2879980	I think the new rule, just fuck whoever you're sitting nearest.
2880980	2884980	But never tell her she looks good, and you're a feminist.
2884980	2887980	Tell her she looks good, though.
2887980	2893980	The question to the panel is, do you think that, famously, we keep talking about this
2893980	2894980	divorce rate.
2894980	2902700	It's gotten so high that basically most erages, that we basically have become a two or three
2902700	2909220	marriage culture, which is just like, capitalism has absorbed that in my perception, which
2909220	2913740	is why I'm proud to have waited really long to get married, because even if only because
2913740	2918940	I'll die soon, I promise I'm going to have one wife and fucking die.
2918940	2929620	I don't want to play into this con, but do you guys think that these kids, these hologram
2929620	2938620	kids, these Oculus Rift Minecraft AR, my dick can be your vagina, the Supreme Court
2938620	2943260	doesn't care, let's fucking do it.
2943260	2946340	Do you think that their divorce rate will lower?
2946340	2949540	Do you think that marriage will now that it has been liberated?
2949540	2951380	No, not necessarily.
2951380	2952940	I'm on my second marriage.
2952940	2954260	This is, Camille's my second husband.
2954260	2955260	I got married when I was very young.
2955260	2956260	God damn it, I really put my foot in it.
2956260	2957260	So I'm one of these people.
2957260	2960260	I'm one of those people you were talking about.
2960260	2965260	I guess I maybe knew that and totally forgot and put my foot right in it.
2966260	2970260	I got married when I was super young to a very lovely guy, good friend, wonderful.
2970260	2973260	Oh right, everyone can hear this.
2973260	2975260	We're getting there.
2975260	2976260	I'm joking.
2976260	2979260	He's a very nice guy.
2979260	2980260	Very nice guy.
2980260	2986260	But who did not push a lot of my buttons and didn't challenge me and I kind of just ran
2986260	2992180	the show and so we got a very amicable divorce, but I feel like what I expected from him,
2992180	2994260	I expected him to be everything to me.
2994260	2999260	I expected him to be like my best friend, my confidant, the guy I cook food with, and
2999260	3002260	like a real fuck guy, and like he couldn't...
3002260	3003260	I've met him.
3003260	3004260	I've met him.
3004260	3007260	You thought he was going to be a fuck guy?
3007260	3010260	All right, all right.
3010260	3014260	If that's not fair for women to expect then...
3014260	3017900	Well I feel like, and I just feel like at some point it used to be that marriages were
3017900	3021940	business arrangements set up by parents to like make more people to work at the family
3022940	3024940	business or like keep money and whatever.
3024940	3026940	Women went straight from home to husbands.
3026940	3027940	Exactly.
3027940	3030940	And at some point it became a thing of like, no, your spouse has to be literally everything
3030940	3031940	to you.
3031940	3032940	They need...
3032940	3034940	You have to be ultimately fulfilled in this one human being.
3034940	3038940	And it's not that you're not fantastic, but when I got divorced...
3038940	3041940	I don't think this is why this was gut-wrenching.
3041940	3045940	I think it's great that you evolved beyond expecting someone to be a fuck guy.
3045940	3047940	You found Camille.
3047940	3049940	He looks like a really good friend.
3049940	3050940	Hey!
3050940	3052940	I'm a fuck guy!
3052940	3053940	Absolutely a fuck guy.
3053940	3056940	The world is full of fuck guys, but I have very few projects.
3056940	3058940	Camille, I'm good.
3058940	3060940	I'm a cunnilingus menace.
3063940	3066940	Is that what Wiley Coyote was called?
3068940	3070940	I think Camille...
3070940	3073940	Camille, you might be a project fuck guy.
3073940	3075940	Yeah, you're a project fuck guy.
3075940	3080940	But when I realized that after I got divorced that I need to have good friends and a good
3080940	3085940	career that satisfies me and hobbies already, I need to already be a whole person and not
3085940	3088940	expect a dude to be the thing that makes me whatever.
3088940	3092940	And once I kind of got that in my head, I found a guy that complimented me.
3092940	3093940	This guy.
3093940	3095940	Who knows what's going on.
3095940	3097940	Yeah, they're just having a night.
3097940	3099940	Bad ecstasy trip.
3099940	3104940	No, I'm flattered that they would choose this place to come and roll.
3105940	3108940	I would have gone to Bootsy Collins at the Hollywood Bowl.
3108940	3111940	I think it's interesting that you evoke the history of marriage because if you look at,
3111940	3116940	you know how in the biology textbook, remember that Empire State Building diagram where it
3116940	3119940	was like, this is the history of the planet and then at the very top there was like a
3119940	3121940	dime on top of the Empire State Building.
3121940	3123940	This is how long humans have been around ever.
3123940	3129940	In the history of the concept of monogamy, the concept of marriage, a vast...
3129940	3133940	The history that we understand is, as you said, arranged marriage.
3133940	3135940	And the idea of...
3135940	3137940	Our tradition of marriage is that it's romantic.
3137940	3140940	It comes from the idea of actually stealing off into the woods.
3140940	3144940	The ceremonies that we get married at, they're actually imitations of actually like
3144940	3146940	terrorist weddings, you know?
3146940	3147940	Like raping and taking, yeah.
3147940	3153940	Like sneak off into a clearing, invite your friends, have that fuck up fryer that like,
3153940	3155940	you know, the end of the Kevin Costner...
3155940	3156940	What was that other thing?
3157940	3160940	It's like that was the revolution of marriage.
3160940	3168940	A very short time ago and since then, what do kids have as a tutorial of what a healthy
3168940	3169940	marriage consists of?
3169940	3173940	The answer is movies in which at the end of the movie...
3173940	3174940	Is when they get together.
3174940	3175940	They're about to get married.
3175940	3177940	I have the biggest problem with this.
3177940	3179940	And then it's like fuck it.
3179940	3182940	You're supposed to be, once you get married, you're happy forever because that was the
3182940	3183940	goal the whole time.
3183940	3184940	Right.
3184940	3188940	Just be satisfied and all these women and men, mainly women, are like, wait, what the
3188940	3189940	fuck?
3189940	3190940	I'm supposed to be happy forever.
3190940	3191940	Why am I not happy?
3191940	3195940	The implication is that if you are with a guy that you've been with for a year or a
3195940	3199940	girl you've been with for a year and there's somebody across the room that's like, oh,
3199940	3200940	there's so much more interesting.
3200940	3201940	I wonder why.
3201940	3206940	The implication that you walk away with from 30 years of rom-coms is actually like, well,
3206940	3208940	you know why that guy's more interesting?
3208940	3211940	Because he's going to make you happy forever.
3211940	3212940	It's either one.
3212940	3213940	He's the real one.
3213940	3214940	It's the opposite.
3214940	3216940	It's like, no, it's like filling up on bread.
3216940	3219940	It's like, yeah, of course you want fucking, like, don't do it.
3219940	3220940	Don't do it.
3220940	3223940	With Shakespeare, the difference between a comedy and a tragedy is there's a wedding
3223940	3224940	at the end.
3224940	3225940	Versus a funeral.
3225940	3226940	Yeah, exactly.
3226940	3227940	Yeah.
3227940	3228940	But there's no.
3228940	3229940	So.
3229940	3230940	It's true.
3230940	3231940	It's a very surprising.
3231940	3234940	Dave just got his brain wrinkled.
3234940	3239940	What you have to do is you have to keep on bumping papers.
3239940	3244440	You have to keep on competing on cases at your law firm.
3244440	3249940	You have to continue to get the acts body spray account.
3249940	3252940	You have to like role play.
3252940	3253940	Yeah.
3253940	3257940	The happily ever after from all the fairy tales is like where all the stories.
3257940	3258940	Yeah.
3258940	3259940	It always ends.
3259940	3260940	Of course.
3260940	3261940	Because guess what?
3261940	3262940	Marriage is not an adventure.
3262940	3264940	It's not super exciting or boring.
3264940	3265940	It just is.
3265940	3266940	It's just there.
3266940	3267940	It can be an incredibly satisfying thing.
3268940	3271940	There's also not a ton of stories about raising children.
3271940	3273940	We skip over.
3273940	3278940	We don't regard raising children and being married as adventures.
3278940	3279940	Yeah.
3279940	3280940	Maybe we shouldn't.
3280940	3282940	That would be weird, wouldn't it?
3282940	3283940	We used to.
3283940	3284940	Finding Nemo.
3284940	3286940	Greek times when we would like leave.
3286940	3287940	Finding Nemo.
3287940	3289940	We need to have a child and lose him.
3289940	3290940	He's right.
3290940	3291940	Finding Nemo.
3291940	3292940	You got it.
3292940	3294940	Well, Oedipus was left out on a rock because his feet were too big.
3294940	3296940	No, his feet were too big because they tied his legs together.
3296940	3297940	That's the story to follow.
3297940	3298940	They bound his legs together.
3298940	3299940	That's right.
3299940	3302940	Some twists and turns.
3302940	3303940	Some twists and turns in that one.
3303940	3305940	You'll be dead and I'll be smoking a cigarette.
3305940	3307940	Let's talk about your book.
3307940	3313940	It's probably not an opportune time to plug it because it's not being published for a little bit, right?
3313940	3314940	September.
3314940	3315940	I'm finished with it.
3315940	3317940	It's coming out end of September of this year.
3317940	3318940	You can preorder it.
3318940	3320940	You can preorder it.
3320940	3322940	It's about Hitler.
3322940	3332940	And how amazing a cook he was.
3332940	3336940	I've cultivated a very odd group of sociopaths.
3336940	3338940	That's true.
3338940	3340940	Do you have a title for your book?
3340940	3341940	Yes.
3341940	3342940	It's called Super You.
3342940	3343940	Yes.
3343940	3346940	And Hannah Nance-Partlow, who is here in the audience, he did all the illustrations for it.
3346940	3349940	She fucking killed it so hard.
3349940	3351940	And it's amazing.
3351940	3359940	And yeah, the book is just a funny self-esteem guide for young women to women my age, essentially.
3359940	3360940	And a self-improvement guide.
3360940	3363940	Do you know of any other self-esteem guides for young women?
3363940	3367940	Honestly, I did look and I've read a few that are adjacent.
3367940	3369940	But I didn't see any that weren't...
3369940	3372940	I didn't see any that many that were marketed towards rookie age.
3372940	3376940	Because I also write for rookie, teenage, late, early 20s.
3376940	3380940	Can you talk about self-esteem and young women?
3380940	3385940	Well, I turned my mic down because I don't want to mansplain and I don't want to...
3385940	3387940	But I think this is so important.
3387940	3390940	You're clearly the one to shepherd this flock.
3390940	3392940	Well, that's a tall order.
3392940	3393940	You look right.
3393940	3399940	You are somebody who definitely, like, your compassion and the combination of your compassion
3399940	3404940	and your vulnerability and your wisdom makes me and I'm sure tons of women in this audience
3404940	3406940	feel so good about themselves.
3406940	3407940	Thanks, everybody.
3407940	3409940	I can't take it.
3409940	3413940	A few weeks ago, I was leaving, like, a pretty disheartening meeting
3413940	3416940	and I saw that you were on a podcast where you talked about your fears.
3416940	3419940	And I was like, oh, I have to...which is called Terrified.
3419940	3421940	Yeah, Dave Ross's. Yeah, that's a good one.
3421940	3424940	But I was like, I have to hear Emily talk about what she's afraid of because I feel so terrible
3424940	3429940	and my podcast wasn't downloading fast enough and I was sitting in my car just crying.
3429940	3432940	But then I was like, well, you're fine.
3432940	3436940	Your life is okay.
3436940	3439940	I'll say, you can just call me. We have each other's numbers. Just call me next time.
3439940	3442940	Really? Yeah, absolutely. Of course.
3442940	3445940	I'm so excited about this.
3445940	3447940	Talk about your book.
3447940	3452940	Talk about your book!
3452940	3453940	You have 20 seconds.
3453940	3457940	Okay. It's a book about unicorns.
3457940	3461940	I hated myself a great deal when I was younger.
3461940	3463940	I had a lot of self-loathing, a lot of self-hatred.
3463940	3469940	Self-hatred both for real reasons and for reasons that I created and then would not stop thinking about.
3469940	3477940	And I tried to think of what would have helped me when I was a teenager and super angry and super goth and not able...
3477940	3479940	Not that being goth is bad.
3479940	3481940	Not that any of this is bad, but this is where I was.
3481940	3483940	How goth did you get?
3483940	3487940	Goth as fuck. You have no idea. You have no idea.
3487940	3491940	Her throwback Thursday, her throwback Thursday game is tight.
3491940	3493940	It is the best.
3497940	3499940	Sorry, go ahead.
3499940	3501940	It was pretty tight.
3501940	3510940	It goes through just getting you on your own team and understanding that you have to be on your own fucking team.
3510940	3512940	Because nobody else is going to be.
3512940	3513940	And they can be, but...
3513940	3514940	How do you get a team?
3514940	3518940	You are a team. You're already a team. You're already there.
3518940	3524940	And just like kind of raising your awareness of what you're doing so that for so long I just kind of function on autopilot.
3524940	3528940	And this autopilot was like, I hate myself. I'm horrible. I hate myself. I'm horrible.
3528940	3533940	And just at some point stopping and being like, I'm doing this to myself and my life's just going by.
3533940	3540940	Like either way, if I spend my time hating myself or if I spend my time learning to like myself in any capacity, it's happening either way.
3540940	3543940	There's nothing I can do about it.
3544940	3548940	You guys have to either talk softer or not.
3548940	3551940	He has a very resonant voice.
3551940	3554940	It's not your fault. You're whispering, but I can feel it in my balls.
3554940	3558940	It kind of vibrates in there.
3558940	3562940	Yeah, so tend your own guard and manage your own buttons.
3562940	3564940	You are in charge of your own experience.
3564940	3571940	No matter how racist, misogynist, hurtful, vindictive, unhealthy, unbalanced,
3571940	3574940	in need of fixing, your opponent is.
3574940	3578940	No matter what is happening to you, it's fine to have reactions to it.
3578940	3579940	Absolutely.
3579940	3582940	But you are in charge.
3582940	3586940	Even if you decide not to make decisions, that's a fucking decision.
3586940	3590940	So like just start like stopping on autopilot.
3590940	3592940	Start having intentionality behind what you're doing.
3592940	3597940	Like even if that means that you doesn't mean that you have to make like healthy choices at all,
3597940	3600940	but like the buttons thing, know what the fucking buttons are.
3600940	3603940	Know what your buttons are and know what presses them and what doesn't.
3603940	3606940	And then if you want to pick someone who pushes all the bad ones, you're picking them,
3606940	3610940	but acknowledge that you are choosing them because you want those buttons pushed for some reason
3610940	3613940	instead of like the world's just like happening to me.
3613940	3615940	It's not. You're making it happen.
3615940	3620940	Even if by making it happen, you're kind of giving up all control and deciding the universe is just out to get me.
3620940	3621940	Right.
3621940	3622940	It's not.
3622940	3628940	And always, always, always as an overriding thing, it's like you're always going to fuck up in that regard.
3628940	3633940	A thousand times you're going to fuck that up and a thousand times you can you can bring it back.
3633940	3640940	But if to the extent that you are honest about yourself, your experience, your feeling,
3640940	3644940	including like walking away from somebody that's making you uncomfortable,
3644940	3650940	not engaging somebody when the only thing at stake is you being right as opposed to being happy.
3650940	3655940	The you that actually in my very, very short experience,
3655940	3660940	since bothering to go to therapy and start learning this shit, it's like I feel the world around me changing.
3660940	3666940	Or maybe I'm just, as I said before, maybe I'm just creating a fucking delusional bubble around me.
3666940	3672940	But if everyone created that same delusional bubble, there would be no room left for fucking nomads.
3672940	3677940	Like everyone would be walking around in this big bubble where they insisted on their own comfort.
3677940	3678940	Absolutely.
3678940	3682940	Not to the hurt of anyone else, but just insisting on their own comfort and safety.
3682940	3683940	Yeah.
3683940	3690940	And I think it's important because it seems like we're in a culture where confidence in women is seen as arrogance a lot.
3690940	3691940	Yes.
3691940	3694940	I think in guys, it's sort of arrogance and guys, it's sort of valued.
3694940	3700940	Whereas in women, it's not like that Amy Schumer sketch where she's like everyone,
3700940	3703940	they're like these scientists and they're all like apologizing all the time.
3703940	3705940	It's so genius.
3705940	3708940	I didn't even get it until halfway through.
3708940	3709940	Yeah.
3709940	3710940	This is goddamn brilliant.
3710940	3711940	Yeah.
3711940	3712940	We're dudes.
3712940	3713940	Yeah.
3713940	3714940	We get it.
3714940	3716940	You're like I'm watching footage from a thing.
3716940	3718940	That's how brilliant that sketch is.
3718940	3719940	Yeah.
3719940	3720940	Like men watch it.
3720940	3721940	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
3721940	3722940	Yeah.
3722940	3724940	Let the moderator talk, ladies.
3724940	3725940	Oh.
3725940	3726940	That's a joke.
3726940	3727940	No, I get it.
3727940	3728940	Anyway.
3728940	3734940	I pushed one of the wrong buttons there.
3734940	3737940	But I think that's why it's important.
3737940	3739940	I know you don't talk.
3739940	3740940	Super you.
3740940	3745380	The idea is that it's like about figuring out what the best version of yourself right
3745380	3747940	now is and then figuring out how to get there.
3747940	3749940	It's just becoming your own superhero.
3749940	3750940	Yeah.
3750940	3755500	It's very vaguely superhero themed, but kind of in a, it's a very loose kind of theme,
3755500	3756980	but yeah, that is kind of the theme of it.
3756980	3761740	I think they're kind of like, like, like overarching, like I'm obsessed with like boiling things
3761740	3763380	down to their most simplistic goal.
3763380	3764380	Oh shit.
3764380	3765940	We totally look how healthy we've become.
3765940	3769780	We were two minutes past 9 11 and we didn't even celebrate it.
3769780	3776020	The whole front row saw it and there was just a general wrestling intention.
3776020	3779020	It's almost like if there was a, if you could try to boil everything down to this overarching
3779020	3786900	thing and it has something to do with seeing past like what's right in front of you to like
3786900	3791220	a more distant goal and actually making distant goals.
3791220	3792220	That's your bad signal.
3792220	3798660	That's the thing that's going towards how you use your fork and how you interact with
3798660	3804340	your uncle and how you tweet and how you, if you, if you don't view like five feet in
3804340	3806660	front of you is how you should react five feet in front of you.
3806660	3812700	If you're, if you instead go, what I want is 15 feet in front of me, I'm going to base
3812700	3817620	everything five feet in front of me on what I'm doing right now, getting me the thing
3817620	3819300	that's 15 feet in front of me that I want.
3819300	3822180	And if it is okay, if it's not, I gotta change it.
3822180	3824420	Rather than just like, just doing this, just doing this.
3824420	3825420	Hopefully I'll get to that thing.
3825420	3826420	Hopefully I'll get to that thing.
3826420	3829180	No, set the thing that you need and you want.
3829180	3830180	And then.
3830180	3836780	Which is called being impeccable with your word and you all mocked me.
3836780	3844340	The four agreements, name all four real fast, name the four agreements are don't take it
3844340	3845340	personally.
3845340	3846740	Don't take anything personally.
3846740	3847740	Baby.
3847740	3848740	Come on.
3848740	3857900	Try to tell people for a moment, be impeccable with your word.
3857900	3858900	Okay.
3858900	3863500	I know the shitty one is do your best.
3863500	3864500	That's the dumb one.
3864500	3865500	Okay.
3865500	3866500	Whatever the fuck that means.
3866500	3867500	What's the other one?
3867500	3868500	What's the other one?
3868500	3869500	God damn it.
3869500	3870500	Avoid making.
3870500	3871500	No, we're not all white.
3871500	3872500	That's not one of the agreements.
3872500	3873500	That's not one of the agreements.
3873500	3874500	Thank you, sir.
3874500	3875500	Thank you.
3875500	3876500	Don't make assumptions.
3877500	3878500	That's actually one that needs more study.
3878500	3879500	What is this?
3879500	3880500	You came up with these?
3880500	3881500	Kind of.
3881500	3889500	Aaron found this book in high school called The Four Agreements, it's a self-help book.
3889500	3890500	And we.
3890500	3892500	They're Toltec laws.
3892500	3897220	Derek Waters, we were talking, we landed on it by talking, we were talking about like
3897220	3898900	fan interaction, actually.
3898900	3905260	We were talking about like how it always goes great and usually and like how sometimes it
3905260	3907300	goes wrong and how it goes wrong.
3907300	3910220	We were talking about ourselves as fans of other people, like if you get into an elevator
3910220	3914300	with somebody you admire, like we were talking about like what, what happens in those moments,
3914300	3919620	those supercharged moments of talking to a stranger and you know, but also don't know
3919620	3920620	at all.
3920620	3921620	Yeah.
3921620	3923700	And you want to make an impression and blah, blah, blah, and all this stuff.
3923700	3928380	Somehow from that discussion, we landed some, Aaron brought up like, oh, well, it's one
3928380	3929380	of the four agreements.
3929380	3930380	Don't take it personally.
3930380	3934620	And it was like, holy shit, oh God, Jesus Christ, that's everything.
3934620	3939360	So it's this, it's, it's a, it's a fun little book from a while ago.
3939360	3946020	It takes two hours to get it up there, but the, uh, but then I, I tried to introduce
3946020	3949900	these fucking assholes to, they were not having it.
3949900	3955980	They're like, they, they think the first agreement is that we're all light pageant Brewster made
3955980	3961700	a mockery of it just because I've only listened to a half hour of it.
3961700	3964220	Apparently I'm not an authority.
3964820	3969820	I haven't read it since college, but I totally don't remember the light portion of it.
3969820	3971380	It's in the first part.
3971380	3974460	It says we're all light and you're all, we're all smoke.
3974460	3978540	Wait, one of the four agreements says we're all light.
3978540	3979540	No.
3979540	3981500	Camille, we're all together.
3981500	3984820	You wouldn't know that from that, from that podcast, cause Dan talked for 30 minutes about
3984820	3988340	how we're all light and you're smoke and it's all a dream.
3988340	3989340	We all live in a dream.
3989340	3991900	It's the same as Plato's shadows on the, on the smoke.
3991900	3995140	No, it's not the same as Plato's fucking shadows.
3995140	3996900	So smoke is bad and light is good.
3996900	4001060	Everything that's happening right now is my dream.
4001060	4002060	That's that's.
4002060	4004860	The spring pageant Brewster out everybody.
4004860	4005860	That's one of the four agreements.
4005860	4007860	No, that's not one of the fucking agreements.
4007860	4008860	No, Camille.
4008860	4009860	You're the genius, evil genius.
4009860	4014420	The idea is that everything that happens is our, like it's through a filter of our emotional
4014420	4015420	experiences.
4015420	4016420	That's very true.
4016420	4017420	Yes.
4017420	4018420	Okay.
4018420	4019420	That makes sense.
4019420	4020420	So there's a technique?
4020420	4021420	That makes sense.
4021940	4025260	I would be pretty certain that if that author had, could add a fifth agreement, it would
4025260	4030660	be, you should read the whole fucking book, but it's his fault.
4030660	4032940	Don't do all four agreements in the first half hour.
4032940	4033940	That's true.
4033940	4036060	All about smoking light and mirrors and shit.
4036060	4037900	So it's a magic book.
4037900	4044340	When did the dragon show on here, any of this, this is all happening in a dream.
4044340	4045340	I don't care.
4045420	4052460	Emily, I have, I have several teenage family members where is, is your book cool to, is
4052460	4053460	there,
4053460	4056820	Yeah, but teenagers should know about sex stuff.
4056820	4059100	Well, Judy Bloom took care of that shit.
4059100	4060100	Right.
4060100	4061100	Are you their God?
4061100	4062100	Yeah.
4062100	4063100	It's totally appropriate for teenagers.
4063100	4064100	I would say.
4064100	4067500	And I do talk about that specifically that you all, you view everything through the
4067500	4068940	light of your experiences.
4068940	4072780	I try to like, if you back everything out, yeah, I'm in agreement.
4072780	4073780	I'm in agreement.
4073780	4076620	I think she's hit the word light in a sentence.
4076620	4081100	It sounds like, sounds like she's in agreement then.
4081100	4085260	I'm in one of four, uh, people that agree with your theories on this.
4085260	4086260	Uh, yeah.
4086260	4089460	Like the idea of like, if you back everything out, if your life was a reality show, like
4089460	4094020	a very boring for most of you reality show, but ours are great reality shows.
4094020	4095020	Mine too.
4095020	4097500	I'm just saying everybody's life is ultimately very boring as reality show.
4097500	4101460	But if you viewed it as a reality show and we're divorced from your talking head segments
4101460	4104620	of like, well, I can't believe he did this and he did this because he's like this and
4104620	4108780	this happens because I, he should know that I don't like you just viewed the situation
4108780	4110420	objectively.
4110420	4113980	Like that's you kind of, you've got to learn to divorce that some of this shit is your
4113980	4117740	shit and you can't bring it anything because the other person you're talking to doesn't
4117740	4120140	have any fucking clue what you're talking keg.
4120140	4122740	So I'm going to say the only thing you can do is control yourself.
4122740	4127620	That's a big, can I cross stitch a very beautiful thing that hopefully will be an item.
4127620	4129540	You can only control yourself.
4129540	4132660	You have no control over anybody else whatsoever.
4132660	4136780	So you have to, like, if you're in a confrontation with someone or in a conversation, just realize
4136780	4140540	that take yourself out of it and watches it if it was on television.
4140540	4144200	Because if it was, you would never, you would just see two characters interacting and all
4144200	4146380	you can judge is those interactions.
4146380	4147980	Everybody comes with their own baggage and their own shit.
4147980	4151900	And you would never judge the dude that was like just hanging out.
4151900	4157300	And if you saw, if you saw, if another guy was like, you know, and if there was just
4157300	4160820	a guy going like that, you'd be like, Oh, you would be like, what a pussy.
4160820	4161820	What a fucking asshole.
4161820	4162820	What an idiot.
4162820	4165180	You'd be like, I want to learn more about that guy.
4165180	4166180	David Hyde Pierce.
4166180	4167180	I don't know.
4167180	4170980	Did you say Hannah crossed stitched that?
4170980	4174180	Well she created an illustration of a cross stitch because I was like, wouldn't it be
4174180	4178620	cool if you had like a cross stitch, like old, old timey pillow or like a thing of,
4178620	4179700	you can only control yourself.
4179700	4183740	So she made this gorgeous thing that looks just like a cross stitch.
4183740	4187100	That's a page in the book that I'm hoping we can make another thing out of.
4187100	4188660	But yeah, we're going to make posters on it.
4188660	4193100	All these things are like, it's so hard to like, sometimes I'll get into these Twitter
4193100	4195180	things and then you're right.
4195180	4196180	Nobody's going to change.
4196180	4199220	Nobody's changed their mind about anything since like the fucking nineties.
4199220	4202300	We all, we all, nobody changed.
4202300	4203580	So I'll get into these fights with people.
4203580	4208060	I have a new, can I tell you I've adopted a troll strategy with people.
4208060	4209060	I'll tell you what it is.
4209060	4210060	I'm not proud of it.
4210060	4212580	Actually I love it.
4212580	4216060	I have a new strategy because a lot of times you'll be talking to people and they just
4216060	4219540	want to, it becomes a semantic argument where they're like, just want to contradict you
4219540	4220940	and it's not about the meaning anymore.
4220940	4221940	It's about defeating the person.
4221940	4222940	It's not about anything.
4222940	4223940	Yeah.
4223940	4224940	It's about defending the person.
4224940	4228620	So you can tell the one more month of you from your 140 character tweet, they're picking
4228620	4229620	one word.
4229620	4230620	Yes.
4230620	4231620	And I do that.
4231620	4232620	Exactly.
4232620	4233620	If leather is the glue.
4233620	4234620	Yeah.
4234620	4235620	So I have this new thing.
4235620	4239820	So if somebody like, cause I'll get people, you know, some, if somebody ever like calls
4239820	4241580	me Indian, I'm like, that's racist.
4241580	4242580	I'm Pakistani.
4242580	4245780	I know research is hard, so I'll do that.
4245780	4249880	But then I'll do, so then the other day I tweeted, I was like, Hey, my people are looking
4249880	4254300	to trade Bobby Jindal in exchange will take literally anything.
4254300	4257140	I said that he's an Indian descent.
4257140	4259460	And so then people will be like, um, you're Pakistani.
4259460	4260460	He's Indian.
4260460	4261460	Do some research.
4261460	4265380	I'm like, actually, uh, Indian Pakistan was the same country until 1947.
4265380	4274300	So I know research is hard, but I got you coming.
4274300	4275300	I got you going.
4276300	4279020	You cannot win with Kumail Nanjiani.
4279020	4282780	Wait, Kumail, you said you laid that trap.
4282780	4284780	You knew people were going to say that so that you could come.
4284780	4288940	No, but I came up with it right then and I was like, this is great.
4288940	4292420	If you call me Pakistani, I can be like, actually, we're all kind of Indian.
4292420	4295460	And if you call me Indian, you're racist because I'm Pakistani.
4295460	4296460	You really can't win.
4296460	4297460	You cannot win.
4297460	4300940	He's saying like the first instinct is to make people laugh, to make people happy.
4300940	4305660	And then the second instinct, if somebody comes back and goes like your joke, I'm not
4305660	4309500	laughing at it, but I have a different response and there's my response.
4309500	4315580	So that guy, if you agree to go out in the alley with that guy, the crime has been committed
4315580	4318140	and what goes out on that alley is your business.
4318140	4322100	And it's like, you're saying like, yeah, you bring out a fucking corkscrew.
4322100	4323100	Yeah.
4323100	4324100	Yeah.
4324100	4325100	I'm not playing fair now.
4325100	4326100	Yeah.
4326100	4327100	Not playing fair at all.
4327100	4328100	Because you shouldn't be out there.
4328100	4329100	You shouldn't be out there.
4329100	4330100	Yeah.
4331100	4332100	Don't.
4332100	4333100	Because you shouldn't be out there.
4333100	4334100	That's a great point.
4334100	4335100	But we should probably talk about.
4335100	4340140	I mean, just that one little inkling though is like the reason you go out there is that's
4340140	4341140	a classic example.
4341140	4342140	Connection.
4342140	4343140	You must be connection.
4343140	4350940	Well, I mean, that person is correcting somebody because they want a piece, they want to be
4350940	4351940	in a conversation.
4351940	4352940	That's also true.
4352940	4353940	No, no, no.
4353940	4357740	I'm saying the reason you go out there, I know the reason, yeah, the reason the Statler
4357740	4360900	and Waldorf guys are like calling shit out.
4360900	4363780	Why does Kermit start engaging Statler and Waldorf?
4363780	4369300	The reason is because for some part of what they're saying, Kermit's like, you know what,
4369300	4372340	the Muppet show is full of shit.
4372340	4375420	It's just some part and it doesn't matter if it's true or not, right?
4375420	4379260	But can we all acknowledge that that's what brings us out there into that alley?
4379260	4383220	I think sometimes if I engage with the Twitter troll, I'm in a bad mood.
4383220	4387140	I've got something that has irritated me that day and I don't want to take it out on that
4387140	4388900	person or I can't.
4388900	4393900	So I'm like, here's a person that will take my shit and I give them my shit and I fucking
4393900	4394900	burn them.
4394900	4395900	I have that same thing.
4395900	4396900	Yeah.
4396900	4401140	If I'm in a shitty mood, I'm never sure of my own opinions than when I haven't gotten
4401140	4402140	enough sleep.
4402140	4403900	He's a real bear, you guys.
4403900	4407940	But isn't that saying the same thing unconsciously?
4407940	4413500	Isn't it part of you when you continue using that metaphor when you go out into that back
4413500	4418780	alley and choose to have that person-to-person stiletto knife fight, which I just recently
4418780	4421580	did with a dude today, where I...
4421580	4424780	Yeah, what was the meat and potatoes of that thing or is that even worth mentioning?
4424780	4433940	I retweeted, I'm happy to tell you, I retweeted a very funny joke by some stranger who said,
4433940	4439460	I would like to see a reality show where Vine stars are executed.
4439460	4446860	I clicked the fucking buttons, retweet, and because I clicked that button then in my feed
4446860	4450780	and remember how they said, I'm so happy because I've started blocking people like Twitter's
4450780	4452580	been a positive experience for me.
4452580	4458700	This guy, this guy just in my feed that goes like, that's a funny thing coming from a guy
4458700	4462900	who let community turn into dog shit.
4462900	4463900	And then I was like...
4463900	4464900	Unrelated.
4464900	4466580	But there's some part of...
4466580	4467580	What do you mean unrelated?
4467580	4468580	Unrelated, not related.
4469220	4470700	Yes, his zing is unrelated, yes.
4470700	4473140	I thought you were going to say, God damn it, fuck you.
4473140	4476900	You could have posted a picture of a flower and they'd be like, that's a pretty flower.
4476900	4480540	But obviously, somebody's drawing me, I'm following some...
4480540	4481540	I'm following something.
4481540	4482540	And where are you following?
4482540	4483540	Let's talk about it.
4483540	4486540	I'm following the fact that I don't think community...
4486540	4490980	You want to disagree with him and let him know that you disagree.
4490980	4495340	I want to know that the guy who says that is definitely a bad person.
4496260	4497260	That's what you want.
4497260	4499700	You want reassurance that if someone has a bad person...
4499700	4502860	I want to know it's not Morgan Freeman logging in and being like...
4502860	4505700	Morgan Freeman's not a piece of shit, I'm sure he is, but...
4505700	4512060	That guy, that guy positive or negative was trying to connect with you in some way, whether
4512060	4513060	or not it was good or bad.
4513060	4514060	He was trying to get a reaction.
4514060	4515060	He wanted to get into your...
4515060	4518020	Whatever's going on in his end, I'm talking about...
4518020	4519020	You don't give a shit what's going on in your head.
4519020	4524740	Can we all acknowledge what's drawing us into these knife fights is a suspicion.
4524740	4530540	I think Malcolm X, I really, really am going into out of my jurisdiction, but I think there's
4530540	4532500	a quote from...
4532500	4534700	Someone just flew across the room.
4534700	4538740	I'm so curious what the next thing you have to say is.
4538740	4539740	Someone wanted to go...
4539740	4540740	And it turned into...
4540740	4541740	It was the longest time.
4541740	4547620	And they now are dead because of me, and I apologize.
4547620	4552260	I'm going to assume that person's black and apologize for that person.
4552260	4554220	I saw him, not black.
4554900	4555900	You know what?
4555900	4557220	Now that you say that, fucking makes sense.
4557220	4558220	Fucking white people.
4558220	4559220	They're pieces of shit.
4559220	4560220	See?
4560220	4561220	Black people are sitting, hanging out.
4561220	4562220	What is this?
4562220	4563220	No, they're not here.
4563220	4564220	Malcolm X?
4564220	4569100	You just called Morgan Freeman a piece of shit.
4569100	4571220	Fuck him.
4571220	4572220	The...
4572220	4574820	I think it could have been Malcolm X.
4574820	4575820	It could have been...
4575820	4576820	Let's just say it was...
4576820	4577820	Say the fucking quote.
4577820	4584420	I'm going to paraphrase it and fuck it up.
4584420	4591860	Behind all of the stripe, the racial tension, all of these things, is the suspicion we have
4591860	4595220	to let go of that anything we're talking about is true.
4595220	4596220	It's the...
4596220	4597220	On both sides.
4597220	4602120	It's like white racists thinking that something they're saying has any founding, and also
4602120	4606520	on the victim's side, the idea that you can victimize somebody to the point where they
4606520	4607520	actually believe.
4607520	4609640	So you're concerned that the suspicion...
4609640	4613640	You have a suspicion that this person on Twitter might be right, that you did let community
4613640	4614640	go to shit.
4614640	4615640	Is that what you're saying?
4615640	4617640	That's what he's saying, but I don't know.
4617640	4618640	I don't know if that's...
4618640	4619720	For me, it's not...
4619720	4624240	Like if I say Bobby Jindal is a piece of shit, there is no doubt in my mind that that guy
4624240	4625240	is harmful.
4625240	4627920	And I'm not fighting him, because I'm like, maybe he is a good guy.
4627920	4631040	No, I see the talk to his children, he's a horrible monster.
4631040	4634920	That's you putting fruit out by wayside.
4634920	4636500	You grew that.
4636500	4637500	That's not you responding.
4637500	4639500	I'm talking about somebody coming up to your fruit.
4639500	4640500	Yes.
4640500	4641500	He's right about that.
4641500	4642500	Oh, to my fruit.
4642500	4643500	Sure.
4643500	4644500	But that guy...
4644500	4645500	That guy coming...
4645500	4646500	You made the perfect example.
4646500	4650580	You went out into the alley with the guy, and were like, you said the opposite of the
4650580	4651580	other thing.
4651580	4656560	You were like, yeah, well, Pakistan was part of India, because there's a suspicion there
4656560	4663700	when the guy called you out, you were reacting to what drew you out into the alley, the way
4663700	4669540	that someone agrees to try weird shit in Fifty Shades of Grey is some white rabbit
4669540	4674460	that says to you, I have parts of me that I haven't fucking...
4674460	4680780	The guy is calling you out, and you're going, fucking call me out.
4680780	4685340	And you're going out into that alley, not because you've got all your shit sealed up.
4685340	4688700	You're going out into that alley because you're like, oh, wait.
4688700	4689700	Right?
4690700	4697780	I don't know about that specific example, but I know what you're saying, and I agree
4697780	4698780	with you.
4698780	4701940	When somebody says, hey, you're a piece of shit, you're a bad comedian, hey, you're
4701940	4706860	not good in this thing, I'd probably fight back because part of me is afraid that I'm
4706860	4707860	not good in that thing.
4707860	4710420	I think that is part of it.
4710420	4714300	The most important part of that making no assumptions and taking nothing personally
4714300	4718140	is visualizing that that other person has their own...
4718140	4719140	That guy who tweeted it.
4720140	4725140	Yeah, like you would never, none of us on the stage would ever tweet at anybody.
4728140	4733140	I just thought of something horrible that I was telling you about that happens to me
4733140	4736140	when I'm playing Mortal Kombat with strangers online.
4736140	4738140	But I'm not going to say it.
4738140	4743140	Reaching out to a creative and saying, well, that's great, but everything you do is terrible.
4743140	4745140	That's what that person's...
4745140	4747140	What do you say in Mortal Kombat?
4747140	4750140	No, I turned my mic off, but I think it.
4750140	4751140	Where I kind of...
4751140	4752140	It's horrible.
4752140	4753140	It's very, very bad.
4753140	4754140	Just say it.
4754140	4755140	No, it's bad.
4755140	4756140	Just say it.
4756140	4757140	No, come on.
4757140	4758140	Can we make this a safe place?
4758140	4759140	Is this a no judgment zone?
4759140	4760140	I don't feel good about it.
4760140	4762140	It's a no judgment zone.
4762140	4763140	Okay.
4763140	4764140	Don't judge me on this.
4764140	4766140	This is me at my worst.
4766140	4767140	And I say...
4767140	4772140	So I will play Mortal Kombat, and just because it's one person, I get really into it and
4772140	4773140	I really want to win.
4773140	4777140	And then some people, I'm not as good as a lot of people are.
4777140	4781140	They'll beat me, and then I could tell that they're fucking shitty.
4781140	4785140	I could tell when I'm playing someone, I'm like, oh, you're a bad person.
4785140	4788140	Not by their skill, but by how the spam moves.
4788140	4789140	I think I'm...
4789140	4791140	Is there an honorable way to play?
4791140	4792140	Yes.
4792140	4794140	Yeah, you don't spam fireballs.
4794140	4796140	You don't spam fireballs.
4796140	4797140	You do not spam fireballs.
4797140	4798140	You don't when...
4798140	4799140	The fifth agreement.
4799140	4801140	That's the title of the episode.
4801140	4802140	The fucking move over and over.
4802140	4803140	Yes.
4803140	4805140	And I'm on pretty solid footing, I think.
4805140	4806140	Yeah.
4806140	4807140	It's a personality test.
4807140	4813140	And also, Spencer, when they beat me, because they fucking did fireballs, they come and
4813140	4815140	they like, um, teabag me, right?
4815140	4817140	And now I'm like, you're a bad person.
4817140	4818140	Yeah.
4818140	4821140	And I want to turn my mic on and be like, I'm going to show on HBO.
4821140	4822140	This is all you have.
4822140	4823140	You're not lying.
4823140	4824140	No shame.
4824140	4825140	No shame.
4825140	4826140	He's terrible.
4826140	4827140	He's still horrible.
4828140	4829140	Because it's fucking true.
4829140	4830140	I feel horrible.
4830140	4831140	It's how you feel.
4831140	4838140	And everyone playing a fucking Mortal Kombat, fuck these kids.
4838140	4840140	They should always know that.
4840140	4848140	I have talked to Academy Award-winning, not nominated, winning actors who go through the
4848140	4849140	same thing.
4849140	4851140	And they have come to me.
4851140	4856140	We've talked about, like, online video games, fucking people who have Oscars, multiple Oscars,
4856140	4860140	Ebbies, are like, they're like, man, this fucking kid, the fucking...
4862140	4863140	Called me a faggot.
4863140	4867140	And I said, did you tell him Scorsese loves you?
4869140	4870140	But by the way...
4870140	4871140	And then they go, nah, nah.
4871140	4872140	Because I'm like, why not?
4872140	4873140	He's bringing out everything.
4873140	4875140	Teach that fucking piece of shit.
4875140	4876140	But here's what would happen.
4876140	4879140	If he said that, the kid would go, fucking hate that show.
4879140	4880140	It's fucking stupid.
4880140	4881140	That's what would happen.
4881140	4882140	That's exactly what he would do.
4882140	4883140	Not with Scorsese.
4883140	4884140	It's not possible.
4884140	4885140	No, you're right.
4885140	4888140	You should never Scorsese spam anybody on YouTube.
4888140	4890140	And there's no way to prove it.
4890140	4892140	Oh, we should all tell everyone that we're Scorsese.
4892140	4893140	It is so gratifying.
4893140	4896140	It never has a quote from me thing felt great.
4896140	4897140	I've never done that.
4897140	4899140	But I feel it every now and then.
4899140	4901140	He does say it out loud in our house, but not on the mic.
4901140	4902140	I thought you really did it.
4902140	4903140	Huh?
4903140	4904140	Wait, I thought you...
4904140	4905140	No, I turned...
4905140	4906140	He doesn't have the mic on.
4906140	4908140	I took us through a whole museum.
4908140	4909140	You said we're...
4909140	4910140	No, no, no.
4910140	4913140	I thought you were in the mic on it, but I don't do it.
4913140	4914140	Because they'll know.
4914140	4915140	Oh, okay.
4915140	4916140	It's that fucking guy.
4916140	4919140	If they watch the show, and that's me arrogant assuming they watch the show.
4919140	4920140	That's true.
4920140	4921140	I would know.
4921140	4922140	They would know.
4922140	4923140	I have...
4923140	4924140	I guess I should...
4924140	4925140	What I should say is...
4925140	4926140	I'm not going to say it.
4926140	4927140	It's that you said it.
4927140	4928140	What?
4928140	4929140	I'm not going to say it.
4929140	4930140	No.
4930140	4931140	I'm on a very popular CBS show.
4931140	4932140	No.
4932140	4933140	What have you...
4933140	4934140	This is all you have.
4934140	4935140	No.
4935140	4936140	Just change the network.
4936140	4937140	No.
4937140	4941140	I have the opposite impulse to tell the person how much they hurt me.
4941140	4943900	But see, but you're doing that because you want them to feel bad.
4943900	4944900	You want to shame them.
4944900	4945900	I...
4945900	4946900	Yeah, I think...
4946900	4947900	What are you...
4947900	4949900	You're not spreading like, oh, let me explain to you emotions.
4949900	4952740	You're like, no, I want to make you feel bad for making me feel bad.
4952740	4956960	I want to reckon with them and be like, we're in the same room and I'm another human being
4956960	4963220	and you just spewed this really shitty thing at me and I want you to look in my bloodshot
4963220	4968260	crying eyes, which is why I send those gifs.
4968260	4969260	Just what?
4969260	4970860	I've done that a lot.
4971460	4976540	I think that on the scale of things that are effective, ineffective, a good way to live
4976540	4981740	your life, and then that's definitely way closer, the irony is just to guard it up.
4981740	4984860	But however, I usually do it vindictively.
4984860	4985860	Don't you kind of...
4985860	4986860	Are you kind of...
4986860	4987860	I could vindictively.
4987860	4988860	I would do it.
4988860	4990180	I would go like, hey, man, that really hurts my feelings.
4990180	4991180	I know I'm high-roading though.
4991180	4992180	Yes.
4992180	4993180	That's it.
4993180	4994180	The knowledge that you're high-roading.
4994180	4995180	Yeah.
4995180	4996180	I think you have to cross it.
4996180	4997180	You're really going to do that.
4997180	4998520	You have to cross the threshold and go like, hey, man.
4998520	4999520	You have to be actually...
4999520	5000520	I'm vulnerable.
5000520	5005360	I don't do it vindictively, but I think that you guys are in a better place.
5005360	5009240	I do it out of like, hey, you're right.
5009240	5011960	I am a dirty piece of shit.
5011960	5016680	I am a feminist BJ giver.
5016680	5021240	And that hurts me, you saying that, because this is just going to continue to be depressing.
5021240	5023720	I'm going to start saying that I am Kameil.
5023720	5026640	Tell everyone you're Kameil.
5026640	5028200	Just tell everyone you're Kameil.
5028200	5032520	The only really problem I have on Twitter is that people threaten in Portuguese to bathe
5032520	5036160	in my blood because they think I'm the guy that created fucking Teen Wolf on MTV.
5036160	5037160	Wait.
5037160	5042400	Is that a threat or is that the sexiest thing ever?
5042400	5045320	Does Teen Wolf kill a Portuguese family?
5045320	5050560	The creator of MTV's Teen Wolf is Jeff Davis, who's not on Twitter for fucking good reason
5050560	5051560	because...
5051560	5053520	Well, why is it Portuguese people?
5053520	5057600	Loads of Brazilians and Turkish people are constantly...
5057600	5059600	You don't want the Turks angry at you.
5059600	5066040	No, I get threatened with like decapitation and blood baths and like real...
5066040	5067040	That's racist, dude.
5067040	5068040	So they're fans.
5068040	5069320	I just did that.
5069320	5072720	I baited you into something and I was like, come on, dude.
5072720	5073720	That'd be bigger.
5073720	5074720	You're not Turkish.
5074720	5075720	Be bigger than that.
5075720	5077800	You don't get to have the whole fucking Near East, man.
5077800	5078800	Sorry.
5078800	5083720	You don't want the Turks mad at you and Jeff said, you're right, because I'll kill you.
5083720	5084720	Fuck you, you redneck.
5084720	5085720	You would say that.
5085920	5087920	You would say that.
5087920	5089920	I can say that because they're my people.
5089920	5092120	Everyone's your people.
5092120	5095960	My people can expand and contract based on my needs.
5095960	5098640	The Turks have hated the Pakistanis for fucking centuries.
5098640	5099640	We're all the same.
5099640	5100640	No, you're not.
5105640	5112160	You won't be able to tell Pakistanis and Turks apart in a lineup and if you can, you're racist.
5112160	5113160	You're not going to win this one, Jeff.
5113160	5114160	I'm sorry.
5114160	5115160	He's got a lot of practice.
5115600	5116600	Go ahead.
5116600	5119720	Turks and Portuguese people love the show.
5119720	5120720	Hate the show.
5120720	5121720	I think they love it so much.
5121720	5122720	A literal bloodbath.
5122720	5126720	They love it, but I keep, apparently I, not like the other Jeff Davis, keeps killing off
5126720	5129600	characters they love or the people that they ship, they want.
5129600	5130600	They're Portuguese giant.
5130600	5131600	Oh, oh.
5131600	5132600	It's called Teen Wolf.
5132600	5136080	I'm not shipping the right characters, so it's like, we want more of these two characters
5136080	5140520	to fuck on Teen Wolf and if not, I will come to your house and eviscerate you.
5140520	5141520	This is.
5141520	5145760	So I have to go on Google Translate and find out what I'm fucking being threatened with.
5145760	5151680	And when I hit, when I pull off a giant block of text and I put it into Translate, I'm like,
5151680	5152680	oh, Jesus.
5152680	5157920	Well, in all fairness to the Portuguese, that's just shipping.
5157920	5162320	There's a lot of Portuguese people that are just watching Teen Wolf and being like, wow,
5162320	5164160	he's a teen and a wolf.
5164160	5165160	I was recently.
5165160	5167600	The Portuguese shippers, you're the ones that are finding you.
5167600	5168600	Now you're being racist.
5168680	5173560	I was recently listening to a podcast that I very, very much enjoy that I will not name
5173560	5178360	in this moment that was talking about Silicon Valley and then brought up Kumail.
5178360	5180360	And someone said, well, yeah, he's Pakistani.
5180360	5183240	And someone said, no, no, no, you're being racist.
5183240	5184240	He's Indian.
5184240	5185240	And when.
5185240	5187240	Well, they are.
5187240	5188240	No.
5188240	5189240	Or are they?
5189240	5190240	Yeah.
5190240	5191240	Only time will tell.
5191240	5194480	It depends on whether they like the show or not.
5194480	5195480	Yeah.
5195480	5196480	Do they like the show?
5196480	5197480	Yeah.
5197480	5198480	Oh, they're not racist.
5199360	5200360	Yeah.
5200360	5201360	Yeah.
5201360	5202360	Yeah.
5202360	5203360	No.
5203360	5204360	No.
5204360	5205360	Because it was in the context of them talking about feminism on the show.
5205360	5206920	But they really love the show and they think you're great.
5206920	5208640	And then someone's like, no, no, no, I know him.
5208640	5209720	He's Indian.
5209720	5216080	And I got really fired up about it for some reason and not out of anger.
5216080	5220480	But I was like, maybe I'll make a fake account and maybe I'll say, oh, my God.
5220480	5221480	Yeah.
5221480	5222480	And maybe I'll say, you're wrong.
5222480	5223480	And maybe I'll say, you're wrong?
5223480	5224480	And maybe I'll say, you're wrong?
5224480	5225480	And maybe I'll say, you're wrong?
5225480	5226480	There's an emotion.
5227480	5228480	They started to smush in just like a flat landscape.
5228480	5232600	I think there's an emotion that we haven't named yet, which is like, it's like when you
5232600	5236080	have knowledge that the other person doesn't and you know you're right and they don't know
5236080	5239520	you're right and you're getting ready to drop the fucking hammer.
5239520	5241220	That is such a good feeling.
5241220	5242880	And I don't, there's no word for it.
5242880	5248960	And I'm sure the Germans have one, but I don't, but I love that feeling.
5248960	5252960	But the problem is, even that is subjective because, you know, the Germans thought they
5252960	5256080	had good knowledge about something and turned out they weren't right about it.
5256680	5257680	They called that Monday.
5257680	5262280	Well, did you hear this American Life that came out a couple of weeks ago where they
5262280	5268600	talked about how when people who are faced with an alternative view about an opinion
5268600	5272480	that might make no sense, like if I say, no, the world is flat and someone comes to them
5272480	5277840	and says, no, here's a satellite picture of the earth, they're more likely to double down.
5277840	5279880	Yes, it's confirmation bias.
5279880	5280880	It's called confirmation bias.
5280880	5283280	Then to like, then to believe what you say.
5283280	5285080	What is confirmation bias?
5285080	5289080	It's just the idea that once you have an idea and you're like, this is correct, you'll
5289080	5293520	only seek out information that reinforces the belief you have.
5293520	5297080	And if you get any information that doesn't reinforce it, you're like, well, that's completely
5297080	5298080	wrong.
5298080	5301560	And I think that's fucking great news.
5301560	5302560	Don't you?
5302560	5303560	Because no, no, no.
5303560	5309560	I mean, for real, like that is the God particle that we've been looking for because that lets
5309560	5311080	us all off the hook.
5311080	5312080	Don't you fucking start.
5312080	5313080	You'll see.
5313080	5314080	I don't understand.
5315080	5316080	They already found the God particle.
5316080	5317080	I'm about to explain it.
5317080	5319080	We spent hours writing this show.
5319080	5320080	It'll come back around.
5320080	5328200	If it is instinctive to primates to do that, which I would applaud because primates should
5328200	5331080	not automatically just go, oh, I think I'll do this.
5331080	5333360	Oh, you said that I'll do that.
5333360	5338840	If that is a thing that we have to overcome, then we all get to just say, okay, that's
5338840	5343800	a thing that happens to me because I experience it every fucking day.
5343800	5350760	When I read an essay about the misogyny of Pirates of the Caribbean 2, Beyond the Pearl
5350760	5351760	of the...
5351760	5354640	It was so sexist, you guys.
5354640	5358400	It doesn't help that the person is not funny, is never funny.
5358400	5361720	Anyone who's going to write that article is like a fucking, like, just joylessly...
5361720	5364720	They're not one of the good ones.
5364720	5366720	They're not one of the good ones.
5366720	5367720	They're not one of the good ones.
5367720	5373120	But overriding that is like my sense of like, you know, I always, always feel that triggered,
5373120	5379000	that hinge, that safety valve that goes like, oh, are you telling me that now this is going
5379000	5380000	to be that?
5380000	5381000	Fuck that.
5381000	5382000	Where's it end?
5382000	5383000	What is it?
5383000	5384000	Where's it end?
5384000	5385000	What are we going to do?
5385000	5386000	What does it take for you...
5386000	5387000	Is Michael Cera going to play Shaft?
5387000	5388000	No one's calling for that.
5388000	5389000	That would be so great.
5389000	5399160	What does it take for you to change your mind about something, generally?
5399160	5401360	To be fucking honest with you?
5401360	5409600	The reason for my enthusiasm for you, it takes acquiescence, it takes positivity.
5409600	5415920	That's why I was so adamant about like, what can we figure out about the way you approach
5415920	5418320	things because I have never...
5418320	5426280	In the years that I have known you, I'm positive that if I was ever going to exhibit characteristics
5426280	5433100	or thoughts or ideals or semantic flurbs that would possibly trigger you, I've definitely
5433100	5435880	probably threw them toward you at some point.
5435880	5441240	I'm sure they floated down, so I'm saying to you, and you've never made it my problem
5441240	5449720	and you've never capitulated, we don't drink together every night, we're not like blood
5449720	5456240	brothers and pinky swear brothers and let's agree to alter each other's reality brothers.
5456240	5466360	You're a virtual stranger to me that just is impeccable with their word.
5466360	5469760	Leave it then.
5469760	5478080	And invites people upward, like when you say, here is a list of ways that you can tell people
5478080	5483440	that they're a good person without telling them how they look, there is nothing in that
5483440	5488240	communique that suggests to you that you're a defective unit.
5488240	5489240	We like you so much.
5489240	5493160	There is everything in that communique that suggests to you that you have an ability to
5493160	5496360	repair yourself and evolve upward.
5496360	5498480	So you always feel like you're winning.
5498480	5502200	In video games, we wouldn't play video games if every...
5502200	5504680	Like, you're doing this wrong, you fuck off.
5504680	5505680	You fucked up.
5505680	5506680	Start over.
5506680	5507680	Start the fuck over.
5507680	5510820	What happens in video games and the reason people are addicted to them is because that
5510820	5513500	is the effect that video games have on people.
5513500	5517300	They go, congratulations on running across this log a thousand times.
5517300	5520540	That's a very good analogy.
5520540	5522420	That's actually a really great analogy.
5522420	5526300	Here's a diagram you can use to make a sword that kills ghouls better.
5526300	5527300	Yeah.
5527300	5529140	Oh my God.
5529140	5534420	There's nothing, no one ever says, you're killing ghouls wrong, I'm going to rape you.
5534420	5535420	That's because I'm playing...
5535420	5540420	You use the word rape as a metaphor, I'm going to stop listening to your podcast.
5541020	5545260	That's so true because I'm playing Arkham Knight right now and it would be so horrible
5545260	5549580	it's like, you're Batman and you can't find your way out of this police station?
5549580	5552020	You're fucking Batman.
5552020	5553020	What are you doing?
5553020	5554020	Get it together.
5554020	5555020	It's not like that.
5555020	5557980	But that's what Emily's really good at and what you said earlier is...
5557980	5558980	I'm dying?
5558980	5561980	I feel like I'm going to get to the top of the room.
5561980	5563700	Yeah, we have some bad news, Emily.
5563700	5567100	Emily, you died in 9-11.
5567100	5569300	Your test results just came back.
5569300	5570980	You died in 9-11.
5570980	5573260	What you're really good at is keeping your eye on...
5573260	5575260	And you didn't work in the buildings.
5575260	5578260	Why was I there?
5578260	5579260	You're one of the pilots.
5579260	5580260	You're one of the pilots.
5580260	5582420	What do you think the fucking arc is?
5582420	5584620	Oh no.
5584620	5585620	I love my dad.
5585620	5586620	Okay, go ahead.
5586620	5591060	Well, I think it's always keeping your eye on the prize and getting what you want to
5591060	5592060	get out of an interaction.
5592060	5597300	For instance, if we're supposed to fly on a flight and this really happened and they
5597300	5600660	checked Emily and they're like, oh no, we bumped you to the next flight.
5600660	5601780	And I'm like, that is...
5601780	5602940	I'll get self-righteous.
5602940	5605140	I'll get like, this is wrong.
5605140	5606380	This is immoral.
5606380	5607900	This is not good.
5607900	5608900	Fucking fix it.
5608900	5611620	And Emily's like, Emily will befriend them and talk to them nicely.
5611620	5613180	I dare you to be better, she says.
5613180	5614740	And then get them to...
5614740	5615740	And her...
5615740	5619180	Like, this was a couple weeks ago, Emily was supposed to have some surgery and they called
5619180	5620860	and they were like, oh, we can't do it anymore.
5620860	5621940	And I'd taken the week off.
5621940	5623140	She'd taken the week off to do it.
5623140	5624820	And I was like, give me their number.
5624820	5625820	I will talk to them.
5626260	5628100	And she's like, that's the worst idea.
5628820	5630420	Yeah, I have an HBO show.
5632420	5633420	I am pretty good at portal cutting.
5633420	5636980	You're supposed to cut my wife open and fix her insides and I'd demean you do it when
5636980	5637980	you're supposed to do it.
5637980	5641460	And I don't care if you're stressed out or angry while you're cutting her open.
5641460	5645820	What Emily did was, yeah, you don't want waiters to spit in your food and you don't want the
5645820	5646820	doctor angry.
5646820	5647820	You don't want to perform any surgery.
5647820	5648820	That's totally true.
5648820	5653060	But what Emily did was she's like, okay, hung up the phone, was like angry and sort of dealt
5653060	5658860	with it and then called back, befriended the person on the phone and got the job done.
5658860	5659860	It got it.
5659860	5660860	It happened.
5660860	5662180	My technique never works.
5662180	5663180	No, not once.
5663180	5664620	And you keep doing it.
5664620	5666580	It's calling it a technique is really overstated.
5666580	5669860	There are times I've had to pull you away from stuff.
5669860	5673260	I have to like pull you away from yelling and screaming and raging it.
5673260	5675620	Well, I don't do that all the time.
5675620	5676620	Certainly not.
5676620	5677620	But I don't.
5677620	5678620	No, no.
5678620	5679620	Just when things fuck up.
5679620	5682420	Well, you make me sound like a horrible person.
5682420	5683420	You're a wonderful person.
5683420	5688740	It's like when something happens that I feel like I have this thing where I want everyone
5688740	5690820	to do their job right.
5690820	5694260	And if they don't do it right, then I get like, I'm like, I get a little indignant and
5694260	5698460	I get self-righteous and I'm like, this is your job because that's always what gets you
5698460	5699460	the results.
5699460	5703700	Because you feel like if you don't do something about something, people are going to fuck
5703700	5704700	you over.
5704700	5705700	Yes.
5705700	5708420	I have that thing since the kid because I was, you know, bullied as a kid.
5708420	5710420	I'm like, this fucking person is bullying me.
5710420	5711780	I'm not going to take it anymore.
5711780	5712780	Yeah.
5712780	5714540	But we don't live in that world anymore.
5714540	5715540	Nobody ever.
5715540	5721420	There's examples of fucking like dumb archetypes of like, hey, listen, you fucking, I'm going
5721420	5722420	to do that.
5722420	5723420	Oh, sure.
5723420	5724420	What?
5724420	5728940	Yeah, it's primarily fictional.
5728940	5732580	And the important thing is if you start to apply this idea of like, oh, actually, I'm
5732580	5734240	just going to be chill.
5734240	5740020	It's important to note, like you're once you're chill, you're going to get you're going to
5740020	5744140	be all kinds of people getting away with all kinds of shit, but letting them get away
5744140	5748060	with it and walking around them, walking away from them, you're going to end up getting
5748060	5751060	farther, faster than anybody.
5751060	5755300	I literally picture it like the Sims, like have you guys played the Sims?
5755300	5756300	Come on.
5756300	5757300	Come on.
5757300	5758300	Sims people.
5758300	5761100	Where you have those like gauges over your head, those little like bars over your head
5761100	5763820	that tell you like, this is how hungry you are, the cell, whatever.
5763820	5765660	Like that's how much power you have.
5765660	5770020	And for me to like, let someone else make me that angry over something that they're,
5770020	5771860	they genuinely can't do anything about.
5771860	5773180	That's me giving them my power.
5773180	5775140	I don't want to give them my fucking power.
5775140	5776140	That's mine.
5776140	5777140	You don't get to have that.
5777140	5778140	Do you want to give up your ease?
5778140	5779140	This is what my therapist gives.
5779140	5780460	Do you want to give up your ease?
5780460	5781460	Yeah.
5781460	5784260	Like you've worked hard to be at ease.
5784260	5786820	Do you want to give that to this fucking guy?
5786820	5788460	This person on Twitter doesn't deserve it.
5788460	5791780	This like this poor lady who was just giving me bad news at the doctor's office didn't
5791780	5792780	deserve it.
5792780	5794860	And also if I befriend her, she helped me out.
5794860	5799180	But I always think of it like you have a certain amount of cake that you have to give
5799180	5800220	to people.
5800220	5801220	You have cake.
5801220	5802220	You have delicious, wonderful cake.
5802220	5803260	You can give it out.
5803260	5807700	But if you're not interacting with people that give you eggs and milk and flour and
5807700	5812380	vanilla, you don't get to make any more cake.
5812380	5814900	Cake analogies.
5814900	5816020	Even better.
5816020	5817020	That's a good metaphor.
5817020	5818020	I like that a lot.
5818020	5819020	Yeah.
5819020	5820260	So you can run out of fucking cake.
5820260	5821260	Yeah.
5821260	5822260	You can fucking run out of cake.
5822260	5823260	You don't want to do that.
5823260	5824260	Yeah.
5824660	5825660	That's great.
5825660	5826660	That's terrifying actually.
5826660	5831060	I'm afraid now I have a lot of phone calls to make.
5831060	5833500	Two egg people and flour people.
5833500	5835500	First of all, Erin, sorry.
5835500	5837500	Give me more eggs.
5837500	5840580	I don't want to jinx things, but this is not only my favorite episode of the podcast.
5840580	5844740	This has been the favorite two hours of my life.
5844740	5851700	We should also like christen it with, that felt, that felt fake, just so you know, that
5851700	5852700	felt fake.
5852700	5853700	That did feel real fake.
5854140	5855140	That's what it's his favorite.
5855140	5856140	And it's your fault.
5856140	5857140	Now it sucks.
5857140	5858140	You took the cake and you kept the eggs.
5858140	5861060	You're all, you're a bunch of dirty egg people.
5861060	5863340	They wanted to be part of the favorite episode.
5863340	5864340	That's racist.
5864340	5870340	Well, I mean, we got, we got, we got, yeah, we got a little, so God, I'm crossing my fingers.
5870340	5873100	Do we have the right combination of, do we have the right number of people to just play
5873100	5874100	Shadowrun?
5874100	5875100	Do we have to fucking get complicated?
5875100	5877100	Let's just fucking roll the bones, baby.
5877100	5878100	Thanks, sir.
5878140	5885180	We, we, we have, we got Dimorge back there and, uh, yeah, let's bring Dimorge Brown out
5885180	5886180	right now.
5886180	5887180	Dimorge!
5887180	5890180	And, Dimorge is the numerical, huh?
5890180	5891180	Dimorge.
5891180	5891760	We can put these together.
5891760	5892780	You sit in the middle.
5892780	5893780	Yeah.
5893780	5894780	Wait a minute.
5894780	5896620	Who's gonna fuck Dimorge with us right there?
5896620	5901140	I think we're, yeah, we're getting a mic, right, Zach.
5901140	5903060	I'm gonna fuck him up.
5903060	5904060	Oh, you can.
5904060	5905060	Yeah, you can.
5905060	5906060	He's doing it.
5906060	5908780	I think we're, yeah, we're getting a mic, right, Zach?
5908780	5914940	I have a, uh, I have a revolutionary idea if we, assuming that we, that, like, I would
5914940	5920580	have somebody else play Jim Nightblade and I, I could play like NPC characters.
5920580	5923340	Who doesn't get Bruce Willis?
5923340	5924340	No one.
5924340	5925340	I don't think anyone does.
5925340	5928340	Can you do a good Bruce Willis bit?
5928340	5933100	No, it'd be, it'd definitely be Dimorge, I would assume, but, uh, let's see how long
5934100	5938100	this has been since you played Dr. Friend only once, like a thousand years ago?
5938100	5940100	I played Dr. Friend the first time.
5940100	5941100	Yeah.
5941100	5946100	You, you know that Curtis Armstrong has played your character with great aplomb and alacrity.
5946100	5948100	Yeah, I heard.
5948100	5950100	He's okay.
5952100	5953100	He's just light.
5953100	5954100	I hope he doesn't listen.
5954100	5956100	We're all, we're all light.
5958100	5959100	You know what?
5959100	5962100	All right, so who's, who's familiar with my character?
5962100	5968100	I, I, I would like, like, uh, I will, I want to like play NPCs and have somebody, somebody
5968100	5969100	play Jim.
5969100	5970100	Yeah.
5970100	5971100	You play Jim Nightblade, Dimorge.
5971100	5974100	What does playing NPCs mean?
5974100	5975100	Spencer, calm down.
5975100	5976100	It just means.
5976100	5977100	Usually they're.
5977100	5979100	It means I'm taking the episode off.
5979100	5981100	Camille, I feel like you should take my mic.
5981100	5982100	Don't, yeah.
5982100	5983100	This is non-player.
5983100	5984100	Yeah.
5984100	5986100	Or Emily could play Mercy and I could play Jim.
5986100	5991100	I also can just make comments on things as they go, not play a character.
5991100	5992100	Oh, wait, no, wait.
5992100	5993100	Isn't there?
5993100	5995100	Wait, if the numbers should work out.
5995100	5997100	If Dan gives up his character.
5997100	5998100	Oh, yeah.
5998100	5999100	Oh, you play Jim Nightblade.
5999100	6000100	There you go.
6000100	6001100	I don't know if I'm ready for this.
6001100	6005100	Just talk, talk like Bruce Willis and go with your gut.
6008100	6009100	Yeah.
6009100	6010100	Emily, Emily, you're a badass.
6010100	6012100	Oh, you, there's another mic coming down.
6012100	6014100	You're kind of a shoot first, ask questions later.
6014100	6015100	You sure?
6015100	6016100	Okay.
6016100	6017100	Why?
6017100	6019100	Because you're mainer.
6020100	6021100	It's muted.
6021100	6023100	It's muted.
6023100	6025100	All hell's broken loose here at Meltdown Comics.
6025100	6027100	He doesn't need to be on camera.
6027100	6028100	That's, that's...
6028100	6029100	All right.
6029100	6031100	Harmon is relocating over by Spencer.
6031100	6032100	Dustin, everybody.
6032100	6033100	Dustin!
6033100	6034100	Dustin Marshall!
6034100	6036100	Can you pass this to Dan?
6036100	6038100	Thank you, Mr. Marshall.
6038100	6039100	All right, Spencer, do we have a guest?
6039100	6040100	I'll do sound effects.
6040100	6042100	Do we have a guest recapper for us tonight?
6042100	6043100	Yeah.
6043100	6046100	I think his name's Eben Burgoon.
6046100	6047100	Woo!
6047100	6048100	Best cookies in the biz.
6048100	6049100	That's an amazing name.
6049100	6050100	That's a good name.
6050100	6051100	All right.
6051100	6053100	Is that an actual guy from Shadowrun?
6053100	6054100	Yeah.
6054100	6057100	He's Shadowrun reference.
6059100	6061100	Last time on Harmon Town.
6061100	6067100	Tiptoeing past piles of dead bodies with Baldwin Brown, BTL chip research in hand.
6067100	6069100	The posse exited the hospital.
6069100	6073100	Joined by their controversial new frenemy, Jesse Yellowman.
6073100	6079100	From the safety of Dr. Friend's Force Shield, or Force Five shimmering force energy wall,
6079100	6085100	Nightblade took the time to taunt the remaining guards with rude gestures before joining the party in their escape.
6085100	6091100	There, among piles of broken and suspiciously used Roomba's rehydrated pizza crust
6091100	6094100	and enfully empty aluminum Sputnik one cans,
6094100	6098100	the party listened to Brown and Yellowman's turncoat proposal.
6098100	6105100	However, the reward of owing the party three in exchange for the betrayal of their employers created a rift.
6105100	6110100	Court of Guard and Nightblade repeatedly argued with Mercy and Dr. Friend over remuneration,
6110100	6114100	reputation, and the code of ethics of Shadowrunners.
6114100	6116100	As the argument reached its fever pitch,
6116100	6121100	Nightblade seized the chance to surprise and turn the tables on Yellowman,
6121100	6127100	only to be sent to the ground by his top-notch evasive dude, Robo Judo Moves.
6127100	6130100	Who's on the side of cause, and who's on the side of cash?
6130100	6135100	Will Jim and the gang have to dance before Yellowman's non-laser razor blades,
6135100	6138100	or will cooler heads prevail?
6138100	6142100	Let's find out now on Shadowrun Harmontown Time.
6146100	6149100	Eben Gooberman. Eben Gooberman.
6149100	6151100	I have one question.
6151100	6153100	Okay. I have a thousand, but you go first.
6153100	6155100	I have millions.
6155100	6157100	Did you say aluminium?
6157100	6163100	It was hyphenated. It was very clear which syllables were meant to be stressed.
6163100	6166100	I think, Dan, you should play your character.
6166100	6169100	Yeah, there's no way that I should play this character.
6169100	6173100	No back and forth. Just yes, you had to. Come on.
6173100	6180100	Emily, you wrote a book about self-esteem for women.
6180100	6182100	So I'm uniquely qualified.
6182100	6188100	You're playing a character that just failed to stun baton a guy that now has compromised you.
6188100	6190100	You're a bounty hunter, and you talk like Bruce Willis.
6190100	6194100	So we had said no to Jesse Ellerman's proposal?
6194100	6198100	Oh, yeah. Nightblade jumped the gun and stun batoned him.
6198100	6200100	Well, he tried to. He didn't succeed.
6200100	6201100	Are we all in the same room right now?
6201100	6203100	Yeah, you're all in Nightblade's apartment.
6203100	6206100	Okay. I approached Jesse.
6206100	6210100	He's got a stun baton. He's holding it towards you menacingly.
6210100	6214100	Hordegard draws his alpha assault rifle and points it in his direction.
6214100	6217100	All right.
6217100	6223100	All right. Using my charisma, my exceptional charisma.
6223100	6229100	Hey, Jesse, sorry. Jim's going through some stuff. Can we talk?
6230100	6233100	I don't know. Why don't you all put your weapons down?
6233100	6236100	Maybe we could talk with weapons not out.
6236100	6240100	All right. I like that. Guys, can we put our weapons kind of down?
6240100	6242100	He puts the baton down first.
6242100	6245100	May I ask you a question? Am I stunned? What's my situation right now?
6245100	6247100	You are not stunned. You're just disarmed right now.
6247100	6249100	You're just stunned. You went for it.
6249100	6254100	Do not compliment my looks. You may. You may.
6254100	6260100	Hey, I would love to. Fuck your ideas. Sorry.
6260100	6263100	Very sorry. Take that out.
6263100	6266100	He's not a fuck guy. He's not a fuck guy.
6266100	6270100	He's reading it right off the sheet, though. That's weird.
6270100	6272100	Yeah, that's my character.
6272100	6275100	I'm sorry, Spencer. So I have been disarmed.
6275100	6277100	What's her name? Jim Nightblade.
6277100	6278100	That's Nightblade.
6278100	6282100	Yeah. So basically what happened is like two seconds before we started,
6282100	6284100	you're like, huh, and then failed utterly.
6284100	6287100	And then he grabbed the stub baton out of your hand.
6287100	6290100	So let's everyone. Let's put our weapons down on three.
6290100	6291100	Mine's already down.
6291100	6292100	I'll count.
6292100	6293100	All right.
6293100	6296100	Is everyone up? One, two, three.
6296100	6297100	Weapons down.
6299100	6301100	I was already down.
6304100	6305100	All right.
6305100	6311100	I just take a moment to say, this world is crazy.
6311100	6313100	It's like in any other situation, we'd be best friends.
6313100	6315100	And here we are fighting.
6317100	6323100	Jim Nightblade, wasn't your whole point about not agreeing with Jesse Elamin
6323100	6326100	that we have to obey our own code of ethics.
6326100	6328100	We should follow through on the original plan, right?
6328100	6330100	Everybody's got a code.
6330100	6348100	I'm going to fire my grapple gun and try to escape it.
6348100	6349100	I'm trying to escape.
6349100	6350100	Are you Hudson Hawking?
6350100	6352100	Yeah, I'm Hudson the fuck Hawking this.
6352100	6353100	I'm out.
6353100	6355100	None. We're talking to this person.
6355100	6356100	Okay.
6356100	6359100	I tried to I tried to fire my grapple gun to get to escape merely to escape.
6359100	6360100	It's your apartment.
6363100	6365100	Yeah, I'm trying to escape.
6366100	6369100	Firing the grapple gun out your window.
6372100	6377100	It hits a nearby rooftop and holds fast.
6380100	6387100	Nightblade, Nightblade, before you, before you, before you bone out of your own apartment,
6388100	6390100	leave us holding the bag here.
6392100	6397100	Four seconds ago, you tried, you tried to fucking karate chop this guy.
6397100	6401100	And now you're, now you're just, you just take and leave.
6401100	6402100	I don't, I don't take orders.
6402100	6404100	I don't take orders from anybody.
6404100	6406100	We're not giving you orders.
6406100	6408100	No, he has to put out my gun.
6408100	6409100	So I'm out.
6409100	6410100	So you just leave it.
6410100	6411100	Okay.
6411100	6412100	This is your house.
6414100	6415100	All right.
6415100	6416100	Okay.
6416100	6417100	Give me a reason to stay.
6417100	6418100	Give me a reason to stay.
6420100	6421100	Leave it makes no sense.
6423100	6427100	Spencer, Spencer, how close is Eve Libertine to, to, to Jesse?
6428100	6430100	Three to five feet.
6430100	6432100	Um, it's okay.
6434100	6435100	What did you want to hear?
6436100	6437100	That's a great question.
6437100	6439100	Yeah, what was the correct distance?
6440100	6445100	I, uh, I, I, I, I fire my ex shocker at Jesse element as I'm sticking with Jim,
6445100	6447100	Jim night blaze original plan of knocking this guy down.
6448100	6452100	So we basically all decided to put our weapons down.
6452100	6458100	And as soon as the bad guy put his weapon down, we all pulled our weapons back up.
6458100	6459100	Mine is a means of escape.
6459100	6460100	That's it.
6460100	6461100	Great.
6461100	6465100	I, I, I fire my ex shocker right at him as hard as one might.
6465100	6466100	What's your pistol skill?
6466100	6470100	My pistol skill has been a long time.
6471100	6472100	Hold up.
6472100	6474100	It's a six six.
6475100	6476100	Oh, wow.
6476100	6476100	
6476100	6477100	You have an app.
6477100	6478100	I got, I yeah.
6478100	6479100	There's too many dice in this game.
6479100	6480100	I need an app.
6480100	6481100	Okay.
6481100	6486100	With this robot like reflexes, he dodges to the side shocker, shocker bolts plug into
6486100	6487100	the walls.
6488100	6489100	Okay, here we go.
6489100	6491100	I put my gun back down and go just fucking around.
6492100	6494100	Just, just trying to have a good time.
6495100	6496100	And I, I play along.
6497100	6498100	That was funny, dude.
6499100	6500100	That was funny.
6502100	6508100	Horta guard, Horta guard with your innate reflexes in combat senses, you feel some shit's
6508100	6509100	going to go down.
6509100	6515100	You're the only person with the reflexes fast enough to react before he uses his crazy reflexes
6515100	6516100	to do fast things.
6517100	6518100	I've got crazy reflexes.
6518100	6519100	Yep.
6520100	6521100	Well, you did.
6521100	6522100	That's why you went earlier.
6522100	6523100	Okay, good.
6524100	6529100	I draw again the alpha salt Raikou, which is loaded also with shock rounds and shoot
6529100	6531100	him with shock rounds or shoot them in his direction.
6532100	6533100	All right.
6534100	6535100	All right.
6535100	6536100	That one, you get him.
6539100	6540100	Yeah.
6543100	6544100	Okay.
6544100	6545100	What is it?
6545100	6546100	Norwegians would say.
6547100	6552100	You hit him square in the chest and you see electricity ripple through his body.
6554100	6559100	You hit him strongly in his chest and he's knocked back a couple feet just by the impact
6559100	6565100	of the blow and as the electricity flows through him, he crumples to the floor as if in cardiac
6565100	6566100	arrest.
6566100	6568100	I release the grapple from the roof next door.
6568100	6569100	I'm back.
6569100	6570100	I'll stay.
6571100	6572100	I'll stay.
6573100	6574100	Horta guard would like to.
6574100	6575100	That's perfect.
6575100	6576100	That was a perfect sound.
6577100	6579100	Horta guard consulting the group quickly, people.
6579100	6581100	Is there anything that we need to derive from this person?
6581100	6583100	Is there any reason to keep him around?
6584100	6585100	Are we talking about killing him?
6585100	6586100	Is that what you mean?
6587100	6588100	Is Baldwin Brown in the room too?
6588100	6589100	No.
6589100	6590100	Do we just have Jesse?
6590100	6591100	Yep.
6592100	6593100	Well.
6593100	6595100	Priorities and stuff.
6595100	6597100	We have all the BTL chips, right?
6598100	6599100	What?
6599100	6600100	Do we have all the BTLs?
6600100	6601100	You came for research.
6601100	6602100	You have the research.
6602100	6603100	Oh, we have the research, I mean, yeah.
6603100	6604100	I'm sorry.
6604100	6607100	I don't want to medicate, but Jesse's just the guy we ran into.
6607100	6612100	Yeah, he was working for someone who was trying to dissuade you from your mission.
6612100	6613100	How about this?
6613100	6614100	I have a pitch, you guys.
6614100	6615100	Kill him?
6615100	6616100	No, no, no, hold up.
6617100	6618100	Two pizza guys.
6618100	6619100	Four hours.
6619100	6620100	One girl.
6620100	6622100	I prefer the non-lethal if I can.
6622100	6629100	Because we've chosen not to betray our original employer, let's take this guy, bound and gagged,
6629100	6636100	take him back to our original employer and show a faith how badass we are and show him that this guy that wanted to underdo us.
6636100	6637100	I like that idea.
6637100	6642100	So all he wanted to do is dissuade us, and so he wanted us to talk.
6642100	6645100	He was trying to give us this whole play that it would be more moral to-
6645100	6649100	Okay, so then we shocked him and now we're going to tie him up.
6649100	6650100	Yes.
6650100	6653100	If this is a movie, I know who the bad guys are.
6654100	6656100	Camille, you haven't been here for a long time.
6656100	6657100	All right.
6657100	6658100	A lot of fucking shit's gone down.
6658100	6659100	Fucking let's tie him up and take him back.
6659100	6660100	All right.
6660100	6661100	I'm into it.
6661100	6662100	You guys into it?
6662100	6663100	Do we have some sort of-
6663100	6664100	I have rope.
6664100	6666100	I take some rope out and I hog tie that dude.
6666100	6668100	Are we all on board with this?
6668100	6674100	As long as the bag is neutral, galvanically neutral, I'm not touching that shocking thing.
6674100	6678100	As long as everything that we're doing requires a lot of sound effects.
6678100	6679100	Yeah.
6679100	6680100	How does it sound?
6680100	6681100	All right.
6681100	6682100	We tie him up.
6682100	6683100	Let's tie him up.
6683100	6684100	Yes.
6684100	6687100	And we gag him.
6687100	6690100	Oh, yeah.
6691100	6696100	Well, I zip up and unzip my jacket and I unfurl my ponytail.
6703100	6704100	I think I farted.
6704100	6710100	I open up Jim Nightblade's shed, a little like a utility cabin that he has in his place.
6710100	6712100	I start a lawnmower.
6712100	6714100	I start a lawnmower.
6715100	6722100	And while the lawnmower is rolling and going, I start a chainsaw, too.
6724100	6727100	And then I start farting like crazy.
6731100	6733100	Cliffhanger!
6733100	6734100	All right.
6734100	6736100	Well, that was- all right.
6737100	6747100	Demours Brown, Erin McGathey, Spencer Credden, Camille Nangiani.
6747100	6752100	Morgan Freeman's a piece of shit, but we love Emily Vance Gordon.
6754100	6755100	I'm Jeff Davis.
