0	23960	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is now in session.
24960	29960	Oh, you lucky sons of bitches.
29960	31960	We've got a goodie in store for you tonight.
31960	39960	Please keep the emotions high and the hands clapping for the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
53960	59960	Dance break.
59960	64960	Come quietly or there will be entertainment.
64960	68960	Robocop, the original Robocop.
68960	71960	I'm going to go to my grave protecting its vision.
71960	73960	I'm sick of it.
73960	77960	These are the Robocop photos of the guy who looks like Batman.
77960	79960	He looks like Batman.
79960	81960	Just call it Batman.
81960	83960	Sick of it.
83960	85960	I don't care who's sick of hearing about it.
85960	88960	Sick of this new Robocop shit.
88960	90960	It's a good movie.
90960	91960	It's as good as Casablanca.
91960	92960	It's as good as Citizen Kane.
92960	93960	You don't remake those things.
93960	96960	Everyone would be offended if you tried to remake them.
96960	98960	Just because it's about a Robocop,
98960	102960	doesn't mean you're allowed to just go over there and pee a little bit
102960	105960	and see what takes.
105960	109960	You wouldn't do that with a so-called classic film.
109960	111960	I haven't seen the artwork you're talking about.
111960	113960	It's just a guy who looks like Batman.
113960	115960	It's black and it's rubber.
115960	118960	You know that someone's going to go,
118960	120960	Robocop, there's a crime happening.
120960	122960	There's going to be a thing where he goes,
122960	124960	I'm Robocop.
124960	125960	I'm online.
125960	128960	My prime directive is to get jiggy.
128960	132960	He's going to jump in a CG thing up two towers
132960	134960	and off of a roof and land.
134960	136960	It's going to look like Spider-Man.
136960	138960	You're going to go, why is that Robocop?
138960	140960	Robocop's a tank.
140960	141960	Robocop was awkward.
141960	143960	Robocop was an original concept.
143960	147960	Robocop was a guy encased in ridiculous silver metal.
147960	152960	I don't want to get off on a lot of tangents tonight.
152960	155960	Again, the hallmark of Harmon Town.
155960	156960	Focus.
156960	157960	I want to focus.
157960	160960	Tonight's theme is...
160960	164960	I'm just going to look at my cell phone.
164960	167960	Let's diagnose me.
167960	170960	So I've thought in the past that maybe I have Asperger's.
170960	171960	Right.
171960	173960	I don't know if I do or not.
173960	177960	Having met Adam Goldberg, who's a frequent attendee of our...
177960	178960	There he is.
178960	179960	He's center audience right now.
179960	181960	Adam, say something just to support my case.
181960	183960	You think that I have Asperger's.
183960	184960	That's correct.
184960	185960	You can tell.
185960	186960	I have Asperger's.
186960	187960	Right.
187960	189960	He also has a lot of rage.
189960	191960	I'm starting to think like, okay, all right.
191960	196960	Now maybe I don't have it.
196960	197960	Am I bipolar?
197960	198960	No.
198960	200960	Who said no?
200960	202960	A bipolar person said no.
202960	203960	Right?
203960	204960	No.
204960	205960	Are you bipolar?
205960	206960	Are you?
206960	207960	Thanks.
207960	211960	Why were you so confident that I'm not bipolar?
211960	214960	There's a common thread between everything you do.
214960	216960	There's a rational streak.
216960	219960	Nothing you say just enters into the realm of what the fuck was that?
219960	220960	Why are you...
220960	224960	You seem to be an expert in bipolarism.
224960	226960	Do you have a family member?
226960	227960	One.
227960	229960	We see him sometimes.
229960	231960	Sometimes he's not there.
231960	233960	Maybe you're bipolar.
233960	234960	No.
234960	235960	Don't throw him under the bus.
235960	236960	He's here to report.
236960	237960	Okay.
237960	240960	Because I feel like I'm in a good mood tonight and sometimes I'm sad.
240960	242960	But that's everyone.
242960	244960	That's people.
244960	245960	I think Dan...
245960	250960	I don't know what you would call this, but you have certain superpowers and any superpowers
250960	253960	are going to give you a deficiency in some other way.
253960	260960	Like for instance, okay, we know that whatever my power is, it takes away from bathing.
260960	263960	So is that like a...
263960	266960	Do we have super dirt?
266960	268960	Do you know what angers me?
268960	274960	This is why I don't go to a therapist is because what stopped me after going to 11 therapists
274960	276960	is that I was googling around.
276960	278960	I'm like, what's wrong with me?
278960	279960	What is my ism?
279960	280960	What's my itis?
280960	282960	And I was googling around.
282960	284960	And I'm typing in symptoms like psychologically.
284960	290960	I want to know, solve me, help me, lift the hood, like optimist my prime.
290960	296960	And I found a thing that matched a lot of my symptoms.
296960	300960	It used to be called Christ complex.
300960	305960	But then because that's too Western, they started calling it superiority complex.
305960	311960	That's when I stopped believing in psychology because you wish you could diagnose everyone
311960	314960	that's better than you.
314960	315960	Fuck you.
315960	317960	Fool me 3000 times.
317960	318960	Fuck you.
318960	323960	There's a disease called guy that's awesome.
323960	324960	Fuck you.
324960	325960	That's amazing.
325960	326960	That's not fair.
326960	327960	That's not fair.
327960	330960	Do you think you're actually better than people or do you think...
330960	332960	I'm pretty sure I'm all right.
332960	336960	I get the distinct impression that I'm fine.
336960	342960	Who are people that you think are better than you that have skills that you wish you
342960	343960	had?
343960	345960	The Cohen brothers.
345960	347960	And RoboCop.
347960	349960	And Greg Poups, who is our guest tonight.
349960	352960	Greg Poups is here tonight.
352960	354960	And I wanted it to be a surprise.
354960	356960	I wanted to surprise you guys.
356960	357960	I fucked it.
357960	358960	I fucked it up.
358960	360960	I want to take a survey because I want to shame Jeff.
360960	363960	I want to get to the bottom of this.
363960	367960	Applaud if the reason you're here tonight...
367960	369960	I have to word this carefully.
369960	370960	Because you all love Greg.
370960	372960	Everyone should love Greg.
372960	377960	But applaud if the clincher for you coming tonight was that you knew Greg was going to
377960	378960	be here.
378960	380960	That's Greg Poups.
380960	384960	That's the loudest applause that's coming from the Greg Poups section.
384960	385960	No, no.
385960	389960	And by section I mean Greg Poups in the corner.
389960	395960	So I'm just saying that you get a promotional value out of saying Greg Poups is here.
395960	396960	But here's what I wanted.
396960	402960	I wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons tonight and have us get into really dire circumstances
402960	406960	like being a real dungeon hard rock place.
406960	408960	And then go, what are we going to do?
408960	416960	And then have Greg come in like Carmine Raguso in Happy Days and just bail us out.
416960	418960	Will he have a wife beater on?
418960	419960	Yeah.
419960	421960	You know, yeah.
421960	422960	I grew up in...
422960	423960	Look, okay.
423960	426960	There was a show called Happy Days.
426960	428960	There was also a show called Laverne and Shirley.
428960	430960	Laverne and Shirley was spun off of Happy Days.
430960	432960	Gary Marshall produced both of them.
432960	436960	Carmine Raguso was the sexy guy on Laverne and Shirley.
436960	439960	So he became a part of the Happy Days milieu.
439960	442960	They did an episode of Happy Days where Richie was supposed to fight some bullies and then
442960	444960	Fonz showed up and then everybody...
444960	445960	They had their own gag.
445960	449960	And then there was this scene where these bullies were like, yeah, is that all you
449960	450960	got?
450960	451960	And then Carmine...
451960	455960	And then you heard Carmine Raguso's voice going, oh, do I go from rags to riches?
455960	460960	And this 47-year-old man, like, sidled into the stage and the audience went nuts because
460960	463960	it was Carmine from a different sitcom that was also successful.
463960	465960	It was a golden age of TV.
465960	466960	It was amazing.
466960	467960	We can edit all this explanation out.
467960	469960	This never happened.
469960	470960	I'm sorry.
470960	473960	You guys missed a lot by being 25.
474960	476960	You think that you get more.
476960	477960	You get less.
477960	482960	I'm going to die and then there's going to be 10 years after I die when it's just hot
482960	483960	and there's just locusts.
483960	484960	That's it.
484960	486960	And maybe a couple holograms.
486960	487960	Big deal.
489960	491960	It's going to be flickering marble.
491960	492960	That's all a hologram is.
492960	495960	It's just going to be a statue of a guy that invented holograms.
496960	497960	And it's going to turn.
497960	498960	And it's going to go...
498960	502960	You know, in order to make sure you know it's a hologram, it's going to have to go...
503960	504960	Every...
504960	505960	You know that.
505960	506960	You know that.
507960	509960	Fucking dicks.
509960	512960	Is it time to diagnose you after that rant?
512960	513960	I don't know.
513960	514960	We'll have to bring shrinks up.
514960	515960	That's what I'm proposing as a nurse.
515960	517960	Why don't we have Greg Proops diagnose you?
517960	518960	That guy.
518960	520960	That narcissist?
523960	527960	Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring our surprise guest to the stage, Mr. Greg Proops.
532960	533960	Thank you.
546960	547960	Still dances, 80.
547960	548960	Yeah.
548960	549960	You were doing the mud dance.
549960	550960	I was.
550960	552960	I love your tiger fit.
553960	558960	We had a good time last week, so I thought, let's desperately and joylessly try to recreate it.
558960	561960	Let's just make the same thing happen all over again.
561960	565960	I don't think you're maybe mildly Asperger.
565960	567960	Do you get depressed?
567960	569960	Yeah, I do.
569960	573960	I might say depressive reactive or manic-eating, but you don't get manic-eating.
573960	574960	Depressive reactive?
574960	576960	Yeah, you know, like, you don't...
576960	581960	Do you have periods where you like write 20,000 pages of dialogue?
581960	582960	Yeah.
582960	583960	Okay, so maybe manic depressive.
583960	584960	It's called the first three seasons of...
584960	585960	Yeah.
586960	591960	Because the best part of manic depressive is the giddy mania.
591960	592960	Yeah.
592960	593960	Because you get so much done.
593960	595960	No, I...
595960	596960	Well, I'm gonna...
596960	598960	If that were me, I would be on a high tonight.
598960	599960	I'm like manic tonight.
599960	600960	Right.
600960	601960	I feel like even though...
601960	604960	There are nights when I come up here, and we're doing this once a week now.
604960	608960	There are nights when I come up here, and they far outnumber this type of night.
608960	611960	There are nights when I come up here and I go, what am I doing?
611960	612960	Why am I doing this?
612960	613960	It's a justifiable question.
614960	616960	Why did they pay ten dollars?
616960	617960	It doesn't make any sense.
617960	618960	What am I supposed to do?
618960	623960	Except honestly express the fact that I don't belong up here, and I hate myself.
623960	625960	And then there's nights like tonight where I'm like Robin Williams.
625960	627960	I'm like, oh, I've got a cup on my head.
627960	629960	I'm Mr. Cuphead.
629960	630960	And...
630960	631960	John Thurmond.
633960	634960	Hello.
634960	635960	You...
635960	636960	My...
636960	637960	Help me lube.
637960	638960	Oh, God damn it.
638960	639960	I was trying to...
639960	640960	Cops.
640960	641960	Cops.
642960	644960	But yeah, something's wrong with me.
644960	646960	No, I think the manic part's what I wish I had.
646960	648960	I was more hyper, I think.
648960	652960	I'm more of a depressive stoner than anything else, even though I'm pretty hyper.
652960	654960	I don't have the periods where I write the novel.
654960	656960	And you do, and that's what I wish I had.
656960	657960	Didn't you?
657960	658960	Well, can we trade?
658960	659960	Yes, please.
659960	662960	Because I don't have the periods where I go on tour and everyone wants to talk to me.
663960	666960	I don't have the periods where I make everyone around me happy.
667960	668960	Quick change.
668960	669960	Yeah, just...
669960	670960	Greg, you don't really like...
670960	674960	You don't love being out, like, in a bunch of people swarming over you after a show.
674960	676960	But you're on the road all the time.
676960	677960	I am.
677960	680960	So you love the acclaim and the...
680960	682960	Well, I don't do it for the acclaim.
682960	685960	I do it because of Edith Piaf.
687960	689960	I do it because of the art, but...
690960	691960	Acclaim is nice.
691960	694960	I mean, the difference is I'm not a lawyer.
694960	695960	You know what I mean?
695960	696960	Or a tax collector.
696960	698960	I'm not a venal member of society.
698960	700960	I'm not a publican.
700960	701960	You know, that people come up...
701960	704960	What's the word in the Bible where they render under Caesar and all that?
704960	709960	You know, like, one of the disciples is a tax collector for the Romans because they farmed it out.
709960	713960	And people are bummed when they see you if you're a lawyer or you're a dickhead.
713960	716960	Like, I saw Karl Rove in an airport and I was like, ugh.
717960	718960	You know what I mean?
718960	720960	I didn't go like, oh, Karl Rove's here.
720960	721960	This is awesome.
721960	725960	And when people see me, it's usually, aren't you the guy on the thing?
725960	726960	Right.
726960	728960	Yeah, and then I go, yeah, and then I explain who I am.
729960	732960	No, so people are usually happy to see you because you're a comedian.
732960	738960	So they associate you with a moment of joy in their life as opposed to, oh, I saw you and you raised my fucking taxes in 87.
739960	744960	The last time I saw your face, I was finding out it's illegal to have a right knee.
745960	746960	Exactly.
746960	749960	All I want to do is pour a ton of manure on your lawn.
750960	751960	Well, I'm looking at my phone.
751960	756960	I need to remind people because it's almost October and it certainly will be October by the time you're hearing this podcast.
756960	758960	I think you'll find it's Rocktober.
759960	761960	Right now it's the end of September.
761960	763960	Yeah, September just finished.
763960	769960	It's very important if you care about this podcast that you dress like Jareth from The Labyrinth for Halloween.
769960	774960	That's David Bowie's character from The Labyrinth dressed like him for Halloween.
774960	778960	I got two things on the docket to talk about before we play Dungeons and Dragons.
778960	779960	Docket talk.
779960	783960	Apple friend finder and life after death.
785960	786960	One and the same.
788960	791960	Guys all signed up for your friend finder app?
792960	795960	I signed up because you invited me.
795960	800960	So now I know at all times that you are at home and Dino is at the drawing room.
801960	806960	I thought it would take a year for you to actually just try this thing.
806960	807960	I'm on a trial run.
807960	808960	I'm probably going to turn it off.
808960	811960	I didn't think that you would take to the idea of people watching your location.
811960	813960	But the thing is, I don't have a girlfriend.
813960	814960	You do.
814960	818960	If I had a girlfriend and I could see where she was at all times, I'd blow my brains out.
818960	819960	But you don't have a girlfriend.
819960	820960	So why do you care?
820960	822960	The thought of that stressed me out.
822960	823960	You have a girlfriend.
823960	825960	It's going to destroy your relationship.
825960	826960	You know that, right?
826960	829960	Knowing where each other are is going to destroy you.
829960	831960	First of all, I don't care where she is.
831960	836960	Second of all, I like the idea of her caring where I am.
836960	838960	I like that she can see where I am.
838960	839960	It's going to destroy you.
839960	840960	All right.
840960	841960	I'll see you be continued.
841960	843960	Next topic.
843960	845960	Greg, do you have any idea what we're talking about right now?
845960	846960	I adore apps.
846960	848960	I think they're so useful.
850960	851960	That's Greg Proves.
851960	852960	Give them a big hand, everybody.
852960	854960	Greg, great to have you.
854960	855960	We'll see you next week.
855960	857960	There's a reason why we bring them back.
857960	858960	Very safely, Greg.
858960	859960	You've been a real treat.
859960	860960	Get the fuck back up.
860960	861960	Sit down.
861960	865960	Spencer, our dungeon master, come up and set your dungeon troves up.
866960	870960	Spencer, everybody, our dungeon master extraordinaire.
870960	877960	And for those of you just tuning in, we have a dungeon master who's bearded, pony tailed,
877960	880960	and got a bag full of dice.
880960	888960	And it's the ongoing saga and the campaign of Sharpie Butzalot, Corp.
888960	894960	And Greg made a late entry as a unicorn character last time.
894960	898960	Time and all with code in.
898960	900960	All right.
900960	903960	Greg, what do you think happens after you die?
903960	904960	You mean in this game?
904960	905960	No, no, no.
905960	906960	Oh.
906960	909960	So I was going to say Spencer writes it down on a piece of paper, and then it's logged
909960	913960	forever in the anals of Dungeons and Dragons.
913960	915960	After we die, I have the slightest notion.
915960	920960	I hope that it's a fantasy world of what you wanted in your life.
920960	923960	If there's any justice, and I know this is going to sound wildly sentimental to this
923960	924960	crowd of youngsters.
924960	927960	But I want to be with my wife after I die.
927960	928960	Me too.
928960	935960	High five, herd around the world.
935960	938960	I hope it's fun after we die.
938960	943960	I hope it's not a terrible, you know, like in the sci-fi movies where you wander through
943960	947960	a universe where clocks fly by and then there's an odd random duck and then a book and then
947960	952960	a dude in 18th century with a wig on comes by and you're like, was that Coleridge?
952960	955960	And you're like, what the fuck was that?
955960	956960	That to me seems kind of tedious.
956960	958960	I don't like the purgatory limo.
958960	960960	No one wants to do that forever.
960960	961960	Right.
961960	964960	That's the seventh time I've seen Taft.
964960	965960	Right.
965960	966960	Not noteworthy.
966960	968960	Not deserving of my time tunnel.
968960	969960	Right.
969960	970960	Does Taft have an eternal home?
970960	971960	Or what the fuck?
971960	972960	He just wanders?
972960	973960	Am I supposed to save him?
973960	975960	Am I supposed to talk him into eating less?
975960	976960	Right.
976960	978960	And it's past the fact.
978960	982960	I like the Elysian fields, you know, Greek mythology part where it's just, you know,
982960	984960	eternal rivers and fruit and whatnot.
984960	987960	And I would like there to be a big bag of weed that just never goes down.
987960	991960	You know, you reach into it and like, fuck, it's still the same level instead of that
991960	992960	disappointing.
992960	993960	Oh fuck, I'm down to the last one.
993960	998960	I wonder if animals, like there's got to be an animal that thinks while it's dying.
998960	1000960	Oh shit, I'm dying.
1000960	1002960	We think that that's the big difference.
1002960	1003960	I think elephants, right?
1003960	1004960	Well, it seems.
1004960	1005960	Don't they seem to mourn?
1005960	1007960	At least they mourn each other after they're gone.
1007960	1011960	But that might not, that might be, that's not evidence of anything.
1011960	1015960	That's how we express the fact that we think about the fact that we're dying.
1015960	1017960	We bury each other.
1017960	1022960	And what's odd is that Neanderthals buried each other, which we are not Neanderthals.
1022960	1023960	We're not descendants of them.
1023960	1025960	We're cousins of them.
1025960	1027960	The same way we were of chimps and gorillas and stuff.
1027960	1028960	Didn't we kill the Neanderthals?
1028960	1030960	Yeah, we hunted them to extinction.
1030960	1031960	Whatever we are.
1031960	1033960	Look at us, homo sapiens.
1033960	1035960	That's why I didn't understand that fucking ABC show.
1035960	1036960	It made no goddamn sense.
1036960	1039960	I kept making Neanderthal puns and Cro-Magnon puns.
1039960	1041960	It was like, make up your mind.
1041960	1042960	We're human beings.
1042960	1043960	We descended from, all right.
1043960	1045960	Obviously, I haven't found my crowd yet.
1045960	1050960	My beef with cavemen was that they had a lot of makeup and teeth in,
1050960	1052960	and they couldn't enunciate.
1052960	1055960	A lot of lisping and slurring going on.
1055960	1058960	They shot at single camera, but it mainly took place around a kitchenette
1058960	1060960	and their places of work.
1060960	1062960	They really should have just made it a multi-camera sitcom.
1062960	1065960	The pilot of cavemen that wasn't the one they aired
1065960	1069960	or the one they got it picked up that was just flagrantly racist.
1069960	1072960	That race is just too racial.
1072960	1073960	I don't think it was racist.
1073960	1076960	Cavemen have big dicks and dance really well.
1076960	1080960	It was pretty on the nose.
1080960	1084960	And they're often named stuff like AJ and Scuttlebot and whatnot.
1084960	1086960	I get what you're saying, bro.
1086960	1088960	The industry grapevine says that focus groups
1088960	1091960	were uncomfortable with the amount of racial allegory,
1091960	1093960	which, having seen it, I agree.
1093960	1095960	Now, that could mean two things.
1095960	1097960	That people think it's racist
1097960	1100960	or that people thought it was hacked to keep going to that well.
1100960	1103960	And I did think, having watched the pilot, I was like,
1103960	1105960	we get it!
1105960	1107960	What happens in the afterworld?
1107960	1108960	Yeah, exactly.
1108960	1109960	How did we get off?
1109960	1110960	No, I'm asking you.
1110960	1111960	Right. What do you think, Dan?
1111960	1112960	This is my biggest fear.
1112960	1114960	Prince said you can always see the sun.
1114960	1119960	Day, day, and night, night.
1119960	1124960	I take Proops's answer, who cares, who knows, who we don't know.
1124960	1128960	But the thing that terrifies me is something that this,
1128960	1132960	that my original dungeon master, Graham, said at one point
1132960	1134960	when we were in high school, he said,
1134960	1145960	well, when you die, your awareness gets bisected moment by moment.
1145960	1149960	And you become, the moment before your death,
1149960	1153960	as you approach it, it gets increasingly small.
1153960	1158960	And if you cut a number that measures time in half,
1158960	1161960	you can cut it in half an infinite number of times,
1161960	1164960	which means that the moment you die,
1164960	1170960	you may have the last thought that you ever had forever,
1170960	1174960	according to you.
1174960	1177960	That bummed me out.
1177960	1179960	I was 17 when I heard that.
1179960	1181960	It bummed me out, and I don't know what you're talking about.
1181960	1184960	I was like, God forbid you be eating a graham cracker
1184960	1188960	and a bus hit you, and now for the next 550 million years,
1188960	1190960	you're like, good graham cracker.
1190960	1193960	That's hell. That's hell.
1193960	1194960	Here comes President Taft.
1194960	1196960	He's eating a whole box of graham crackers.
1196960	1199960	You want to go out like Michael Keaton in my life,
1199960	1200960	like that movie where...
1200960	1202960	150 years ago, people died a lot younger.
1202960	1204960	Death was a part of reality.
1204960	1206960	People faced death. It was a thing.
1206960	1207960	You could die young.
1207960	1212960	Yeah, and people were mainly like, don't fuck my wife!
1212960	1213960	That's how they mostly went out, I think.
1213960	1214960	What?
1214960	1217960	Did I ever tell you the story?
1217960	1219960	Wait, wait, sorry.
1219960	1222960	Did I ever tell you the story of Schwab's interpretation
1222960	1226960	of the, you know that Major Tom song,
1226960	1229960	the 80s version of the Major Tom song?
1229960	1232960	4, 3, 2, 1...
1232960	1234960	Greg, who sings that?
1234960	1236960	Greg, who sings that song?
1236960	1237960	Probably Greg.
1237960	1240960	I can't remember, but it was like, this is Major Tom.
1240960	1242960	And at one point, Ground Control says,
1242960	1243960	hey, are you still up there?
1243960	1246960	And Tom, who's in space, says,
1246960	1250960	send my wife my love, then nothing more.
1250960	1253960	That's the narrator saying, there was nothing more.
1253960	1256960	I was talking about that song with Schwab.
1256960	1260960	And Schwab was like, God, that's fucking badass, man.
1260960	1264960	And I was like, yeah, it is pretty, it gets you in the ribs,
1264960	1266960	you know, it's like, it's not Citizen Kane,
1266960	1270960	but it's like Kevin Kline and Dave, you know, it hits the spot.
1270960	1272960	And he's like, yeah, yeah, I know.
1272960	1274960	It's just like, the guy's out in space,
1274960	1276960	and he's about to lose contact,
1276960	1280960	and the last thing he's thinking is, don't fuck my wife.
1280960	1282960	And I said, what?
1282960	1285960	And he's like, no, it's like, give my wife my love,
1285960	1288960	then nothing more.
1288960	1290960	Like, don't also give her...
1290960	1292960	No, Rob, Rob, no, Rob.
1292960	1295960	You don't understand where the quotation marks end.
1295960	1299960	He thought that the guy was going out into space,
1299960	1301960	and it's like, give my wife my love,
1301960	1304960	and don't give her your dick, you fucking...
1304960	1307960	You horny bastards.
1307960	1309960	I know she's hot.
1309960	1314960	I met her at an astronaut bar, I don't know what I'm doing.
1314960	1318960	Kevin, I know it's going to be you, you fucking cocks.
1318960	1320960	My favorite is our friend Matt Young thought that,
1320960	1323960	you know the song Panama by Van Halen.
1323960	1324960	Oh, yeah.
1324960	1328960	There's that breakdown where David Lee Roth goes,
1328960	1330960	oh, run a little bit hot tonight.
1330960	1333960	Can barely see the road and the heat coming off it.
1333960	1337960	Reach down between my legs, ease the seat back.
1337960	1339960	My friend Matt Young thought, and it was his favorite song,
1339960	1342960	and I can't blame him, when he thought the lyrics were,
1342960	1347960	reach down between my legs, ease the seat back.
1347960	1349960	Ease the seat back.
1349960	1350960	Ease the seat back?
1350960	1351960	How gross.
1351960	1352960	No.
1352960	1354960	Is there any grosser way to imagine...
1354960	1355960	No.
1355960	1358960	First of all, the idea that they would have had the imagination
1358960	1360960	to say seat back.
1360960	1362960	The seat back.
1362960	1363960	Seat back.
1363960	1366960	I don't want to think of it as a seat back.
1366960	1369960	But if you had one, you'd need to ease it once in a while.
1369960	1370960	Yeah, I constantly do.
1370960	1371960	That's why it's a bummer.
1371960	1373960	The last thing you need is a tense seat back.
1373960	1375960	Every time I sometimes have occasional,
1375960	1377960	like sometimes we, you know...
1377960	1378960	Reach down.
1378960	1380960	48% of our audience knows what I mean.
1380960	1383960	Sometimes you have to ease the seat back.
1383960	1385960	Sometimes you have to reach between your legs.
1385960	1386960	Especially when it's running hot.
1386960	1388960	And it has no place in rock and roll.
1388960	1391960	I can barely see the road because of the heat.
1391960	1393960	He's brought in.
1393960	1394960	I brought in.
1394960	1395960	The seat back.
1395960	1397960	You know my comms ain't coming.
1400960	1402960	You're a Central American country.
1402960	1405960	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1405960	1408960	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
1408960	1410960	You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
1410960	1411960	It's my nemesis.
1411960	1414960	It's the thing that gives me my...
1414960	1416960	Spencer.
1416960	1419960	Spencer, our dungeon master, if you'd be so kind as to recap
1419960	1422960	and take us up to date where we are on the campaign.
1422960	1426960	When we last met, our heroes were in a tavern.
1428960	1431960	They were hearing some rumors about a burnt building
1431960	1434960	that was rumored to be from the Ember Mauler rumor.
1434960	1435960	And...
1435960	1437960	That's pretty meta.
1438960	1441960	In pursuit of the beast, they set off.
1441960	1444960	After talking to an old man about his burnt farm,
1444960	1449960	They ended up in a burnt field where they saw a most miraculous sight.
1449960	1451960	A unicorn.
1453960	1456960	Tylenol with coding was a wonderful unicorn.
1458960	1460960	Oh, for fuck's sake.
1462960	1464960	Steady boy. Steady.
1465960	1468960	And with his help, they defeated the Ember Mauler.
1468960	1471960	Then they returned to turn in their quest to Ferris,
1471960	1473960	the captain of the warden's.
1473960	1475960	So you guys were just talking to Ferris last.
1475960	1477960	Back in this town which is named what?
1477960	1478960	Hawkthorn, what's it called?
1478960	1480960	Thornvale.
1480960	1481960	Thornvale.
1481960	1482960	Who was it talking to?
1482960	1484960	Ferris, the captain of the warden's.
1484960	1485960	But you're not Ferris.
1485960	1487960	Did we part ways with the unicorn?
1487960	1489960	Yeah, he ran off, but you know.
1489960	1491960	Yeah, you may come back. It's like Carmine Raguso.
1491960	1493960	They run fast. They can just come in anywhere.
1493960	1494960	Who knows?
1494960	1495960	Do you guys want your characters?
1495960	1496960	Yes.
1496960	1497960	All right.
1497960	1498960	Can you pass these down?
1498960	1500960	Character sheets are being distributed.
1501960	1503960	I've seen this thing now five or seven times
1503960	1505960	and I still have no idea what goes on.
1505960	1507960	You totally lost the first one. I had to remake it.
1507960	1508960	I didn't lose shit.
1508960	1509960	You left it here at the thing.
1509960	1510960	Guys, don't fight.
1512960	1514960	All right, so you were just talking to Ferris.
1514960	1519960	You had just gotten 1,400 gold pieces from him as a reward.
1521960	1522960	Go.
1524960	1527960	Well, enjoy a reward.
1527960	1529960	You have slain the Ember Mall
1529960	1533960	and you have shown most bravery in such circumstances.
1533960	1537960	Let me leave you one last tankard of ale before I take my leave.
1538960	1539960	This guy's all right.
1539960	1540960	This guy seems pretty cool.
1542960	1543960	Sharpie, what's next?
1543960	1544960	I don't know.
1544960	1547960	I feel like you and I need to level up.
1548960	1549960	You mean make out?
1552960	1553960	No.
1553960	1554960	How do we level up?
1554960	1555960	I don't know what you're talking about.
1555960	1556960	We should...
1556960	1557960	I'm going to...
1557960	1559960	Are we in that tavern, Spencer?
1559960	1561960	Yeah, Ferris was in the tavern.
1561960	1562960	Okay.
1562960	1563960	I'm going to go up to Cha Cha.
1563960	1564960	Is he there?
1564960	1565960	Cha Cha's there.
1565960	1566960	How's it going?
1566960	1567960	Hey, Cha Cha.
1567960	1568960	Sharpie, right?
1568960	1569960	Yeah.
1570960	1571960	Listen, good tip.
1572960	1574960	Good tip on that Ember Mahler.
1574960	1576960	Yes, I heard you took him out.
1576960	1577960	Very impressive.
1577960	1578960	Yeah.
1578960	1579960	Did you have any help?
1579960	1580960	Well, yeah.
1580960	1582960	We had a unicorn drop by.
1582960	1584960	He sat on my face for a while.
1584960	1587960	I'm not sure where that got us, but we certainly got out of there alive.
1588960	1589960	A unicorn?
1589960	1590960	Those are quite rare.
1590960	1592960	Was it Tylenol with Codeine?
1592960	1593960	The very same.
1594960	1598960	Tylenol with Codeine watches over the Connie Forest to the south.
1600960	1603960	Maybe we should go hang out with him.
1603960	1604960	I'd like to.
1604960	1609960	Because, look, once you've had a unicorn sit on your head for a half an hour,
1609960	1610960	you never go back.
1612960	1614960	Was that like a day's walk to the south?
1614960	1616960	It'd be about half a day's walk.
1616960	1621960	Cha Cha, what's in it for us if we go down to the south and hang out with a unicorn?
1621960	1623960	I just told you where he stays.
1623960	1624960	Well, don't get weird.
1625960	1626960	Well, you got weird.
1626960	1627960	What's in it for us?
1628960	1629960	That's a weird thing to ask.
1630960	1631960	Time, gentlemen, please.
1631960	1633960	Time, gentlemen, please.
1633960	1635960	We're not open all night here in Thornvale.
1635960	1636960	You've got to go home.
1636960	1637960	Oh, shit.
1638960	1640960	You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
1640960	1641960	Let's get some horses and head south.
1641960	1642960	Yeah.
1642960	1643960	Can we get some horses?
1643960	1644960	Yes.
1644960	1648960	There's a stable a bit south of the tavern called Coran's Horses.
1649960	1650960	Don't they have a jingle?
1650960	1652960	There's a commercial for Coran's Horses.
1653960	1659960	Coran's horses world is a wonderful world of horses.
1660960	1662960	Did I hear someone singing my theme song?
1662960	1663960	Oh, shit.
1663960	1665960	Walter Brennan, what are you doing here?
1666960	1669960	I'm playing corn in this Dungeons and Dragons.
1670960	1672960	I've been dead for 30-some years now.
1673960	1675960	I love you and to have and have not.
1675960	1676960	Why, thanks.
1676960	1678960	You ever been bit by a dead bee?
1679960	1680960	Hey, Steve.
1680960	1682960	You haven't got any money for a drink, have you?
1682960	1683960	I'm sorry.
1683960	1684960	We'd like two horses.
1685960	1688960	I'd like to hear the theme song again, if you don't mind.
1688960	1696960	Cora's horses world is a wonderful world of horses.
1698960	1699960	All right.
1699960	1702960	Well, it's a bit late, and I ain't got many horses left.
1702960	1703960	I only got one.
1703960	1708960	I got this dappled Appaloosa here, and then I got this tiny goat.
1709960	1711960	Who's going to take the goat?
1711960	1712960	I'm small.
1712960	1713960	I'll take the goat.
1713960	1717960	Well, barbarian gnome, you can have that here goat there.
1717960	1718960	Yeah, Walter Brennan.
1718960	1720960	Here's a nip of my brandy.
1720960	1722960	Well, let me have just a small...
1724960	1725960	Well, you darn fools.
1725960	1727960	You done got me.
1727960	1729960	You can have these for free, you can.
1729960	1730960	Where you bound?
1730960	1733960	South to the forest.
1734960	1736960	Well, you sound a bit tentative.
1736960	1737960	What about you, Captain?
1737960	1739960	I'll take the Appaloosa.
1739960	1741960	The Appaloosa she is.
1741960	1743960	She's already saddled up and matted for you.
1743960	1746960	And I put some extra weapons in there for you as well.
1746960	1748960	There's an emerald dagger.
1749960	1750960	Really?
1750960	1752960	You can just make shit up.
1754960	1756960	We don't get to use our imaginations in this fucking day?
1756960	1758960	No, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
1759960	1763960	I examined the emerald dagger that Walter Brennan handed me.
1763960	1764960	The dagger is...
1764960	1766960	Go on, have a look.
1767960	1769960	This guy's so drunk, Sharpie.
1770960	1773960	The dagger has a silver handle with a gold pommel,
1773960	1776960	if that's a thing that knives have or dares.
1776960	1779960	It was gov'd to me by a man who came here
1779960	1782960	not three years ago this very night.
1782960	1786960	He was heading for the forest too, but he never got there.
1786960	1788960	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
1788960	1791960	This sounds like worthy of investigation.
1791960	1793960	Also, he turned into the witch from Wizard of Oz.
1793960	1796960	Halfway through that, that seems an ill-boating...
1796960	1799960	Something pleasing to the eye.
1799960	1802960	Did you say a guy gave you that and then he went off where?
1802960	1803960	Well, he sure did.
1803960	1806960	He went off toward the forest, never did see him again.
1806960	1808960	Well, maybe he shouldn't have given you that dagger.
1808960	1810960	Maybe that dagger would come in handy, Sharpie.
1810960	1813960	Oh, I think it'll be good luck for you, good on ya.
1813960	1815960	Get out of here, Appaloosa. Whack!
1815960	1818960	When can you put us away?
1818960	1822960	After being slapped in the butt by the horse owner,
1822960	1825960	the horses take off towards the forest.
1825960	1828960	Thank God, the 1930s was creeping me out.
1828960	1832960	You reach the forest as dawn is breaking.
1832960	1834960	You're at the edge of the forest.
1834960	1837960	The path delves into the trees.
1837960	1839960	I examine the path.
1839960	1843960	The path seems of solid construction, well-traveled.
1846960	1849960	I fucking love you so much, Spencer.
1849960	1850960	I examine the path.
1850960	1853960	The path seems of solid construction.
1856960	1858960	Years of people walking on it
1858960	1862960	have given this path a solidly constructed feel.
1862960	1866960	The dust is packed tight with the years gone past.
1866960	1868960	Several thousands of feet...
1868960	1872960	More growth has occurred on either side of it than on it,
1872960	1876960	as walking upon walking has resulted in less growth.
1876960	1880960	Sharpie, I've got a pretty good feeling about this path.
1880960	1882960	I think a lot of people have walked this way.
1882960	1884960	Yeah, but you know what?
1884960	1888960	Two paths diverge in a yellow wood.
1888960	1891960	Is that the only path, Spencer?
1891960	1893960	That's the only path you can see, but perhaps,
1893960	1895960	if you get farther away from the path,
1895960	1897960	you might find another way in.
1897960	1900960	You're out of the woods, you're out of the dark, you're out of the night.
1900960	1901960	Wait, do you hear that?
1901960	1904960	Step into the sun, step into the light.
1904960	1905960	I hear fairies.
1907960	1909960	I'm not a fairy, I'm a guardian.
1911960	1913960	We approach the guardian.
1913960	1916960	This path has been well packed.
1919960	1921960	Oh, boy.
1921960	1923960	What are these guys?
1924960	1928960	Look, I like you guys, especially Sharpie.
1928960	1930960	The gnome I'm not that hot on.
1930960	1936960	This forest is an exclusive forest where people party like it's 1963.
1937960	1941960	That's 900 years in the future.
1942960	1946960	It's a year that doesn't exist yet, and that's why it's so hard to get in.
1946960	1948960	I'm going to let you guys...
1948960	1951960	Oh, nice dagger.
1952960	1954960	Are you looking at my emerald dagger?
1954960	1955960	No.
1955960	1956960	It's kind of called pommel.
1956960	1959960	I wasn't, but that's nice too.
1960960	1962960	Yes, I am looking at your dagger.
1962960	1965960	It glisters like the very emeralds of the sun.
1965960	1966960	Glisters, says you?
1966960	1968960	Yes, it glitters.
1968960	1970960	A new word?
1972960	1977960	If I present you this dagger which has been promised to give me luck through this forest,
1977960	1978960	would you let me access?
1978960	1980960	Bribist me, gnome.
1983960	1985960	You bet your tits.
1986960	1989960	Flattery flattery charges my battery, I'll take the dagger.
1990960	1993960	I need two up front, two up front.
1993960	1997960	I know I'd go from rags to riches.
1998960	1999960	No idea.
1999960	2000960	We enter the forest.
2000960	2001960	All right.
2001960	2002960	We got into the forest.
2002960	2003960	Thank God.
2003960	2004960	So exclusive.
2007960	2012960	Upon entering the forest, Tylenol with codeine is noted of your presence.
2012960	2013960	He can feel you.
2018960	2020960	Do I smell gnome face?
2021960	2022960	Tylenol.
2023960	2024960	Gnome.
2024960	2025960	Sharpie.
2025960	2026960	Hello.
2028960	2030960	What brings you all to my bailiwick?
2030960	2032960	I thought I'd left you after the embermal was deceased.
2032960	2035960	By the thorns of grander flask.
2036960	2038960	By the flaming balls of Kathy Lee Gifford.
2039960	2044960	By the huge canyons of Nebraska.
2046960	2048960	Who's for drinkledoodles?
2049960	2050960	I'd love one.
2050960	2053960	I could murder a drinkledoodle right now.
2053960	2057960	I've got unicorn punch and I've got unicorn Kool-Aid.
2058960	2059960	What's the difference?
2059960	2060960	About five cents.
2061960	2063960	That's unicorn humor.
2064960	2066960	Excuse me while I take a lap.
2068960	2074960	Look at him go.
2075960	2076960	Tylenol.
2076960	2077960	Sharpie.
2077960	2079960	What do you think happens after you die?
2081960	2082960	What happens after you die?
2082960	2083960	I am immortal.
2085960	2087960	Are unicorns immortal?
2087960	2088960	Mostly.
2088960	2091960	We live on forever in people's dreams.
2091960	2096960	They'll never be a unicorn that doesn't exist if there's one child thinking of him.
2096960	2099960	Or a small boy matriculating through a Catholic school.
2101960	2104960	Is there any news of any fortune to be had on this forest?
2104960	2105960	Indeed.
2105960	2107960	At the edge of the forest they say,
2108960	2112960	there lives a man so dangerous that only Spencer can describe him.
2115960	2120960	Admiral Darkstar has started a cult deep within the forest of shadows.
2121960	2122960	What?
2122960	2124960	The forest of shadows used to be the Connie Forest
2124960	2126960	until a dark spell went off,
2126960	2129960	corrupting the branches and very trees themselves.
2130960	2133960	The shadow forest threatens to overtake the Connie Forest,
2133960	2135960	home of Tylenol with codeine,
2135960	2138960	unless someone can prevent the dark influence of the cult.
2138960	2141960	This has been a bummer most major.
2143960	2145960	For the mornings are eclipsed by the darkness
2145960	2147960	and the evenings fulled with fog.
2150960	2154960	You seem pretty upbeat considering that your forest is about to die.
2154960	2156960	I haven't seen all y'all in a while.
2161960	2163960	Where is this Admiral Darkstar?
2163960	2166960	Admiral Darkstar, right? Is that it?
2166960	2170960	Even though he is an admiral, upon the land he doth dwell.
2170960	2175960	At the edge of the woods is he, some 50 hectares hence.
2176960	2178960	That's like a couple hundred yards.
2179960	2181960	Many more hectares.
2181960	2184960	Underestimated I have, for I am equine in brain,
2184960	2189960	and therefore my ability to discern distances is somewhat impaired.
2189960	2191960	Maybe we should camp for the night.
2191960	2193960	Indeed, what an idea.
2193960	2197960	I will make a magic fire using my fucking...
2197960	2200960	I have a hoof thing I can do.
2200960	2202960	Alright, well we should camp there for the night.
2202960	2205960	We'll end the campaign chapter there.
2205960	2207960	Absolutely.
2207960	2209960	Answer everyone.
2219960	2223960	At an out point, if anyone parked on sunset in front of Meltdown,
2223960	2226960	there are towing cars in the next 30 minutes.
2228960	2229960	For reals?
2229960	2230960	Yeah.
2230960	2231960	Wait, what did you guys...
2231960	2232960	Oh, we did park.
2232960	2233960	Yeah, you guys are like...
2233960	2235960	If anyone parked on sunset right in front of here,
2235960	2237960	you have 30 minutes and they're going to start towing people.
2237960	2241960	We got one taker, two takers, three takers.
2241960	2242960	Holy shit.
2242960	2244960	Wait, that happens every night.
2244960	2247960	I remember I went to a junior high school,
2247960	2251960	and every fucking day there was an announcement
2251960	2253960	to go through the whole school, and they would say,
2253960	2255960	if you're parked on Franklin or Washington,
2255960	2258960	your cars have been marked, because they come by and mark your car.
2258960	2260960	There's like spots where they say,
2260960	2262960	you can park there for an hour, but we're watching.
2262960	2263960	The chalk on the tire?
2263960	2265960	For the chalk on the tire, and you got to go move your car?
2265960	2266960	It was insane.
2266960	2269960	It was in a public school, and the teachers would have to bail.
2269960	2272960	They'd be in the middle of telling you about the meaning of life.
2272960	2274960	And so a cell, like...
2274960	2276960	So DNA unravels.
2276960	2280960	Attention, if your car is parked on Franklin, your car has been marked.
2280960	2282960	So I'll be right back, kids.
2283960	2285960	Just hang on to that thought.
2285960	2289960	When DNA becomes RNA, becomes UNA, becomes IDA,
2289960	2291960	I'll be right back.
2291960	2294960	And they got to go move their fucking capri, whatever.
2294960	2295960	Capri classic.
2295960	2296960	I don't know.
2296960	2300960	My girlfriend's car got repossessed today.
2300960	2302960	Well, shit, yeah.
2302960	2305960	We were out at the drawing room having a...
2305960	2308960	What I think can only be described as an elegant daytime cocktail
2308960	2311960	at one of Los Angeles' premier shitholes.
2311960	2313960	Day drinking and I'm thinking of you.
2313960	2315960	Day drinking and...
2315960	2317960	I wonder if there's 8,000 things that can go wrong with your car
2317960	2319960	when you go to find your car.
2319960	2322960	You left to go pick up or to take Erin to her car
2322960	2325960	that you had left last night in Hollywood.
2325960	2326960	Yeah.
2326960	2328960	Probably, you know, because, you know, for safety's sake.
2328960	2330960	And then I got a text from you, like, where the...
2330960	2332960	I was like, where the hell is Dan?
2332960	2333960	And...
2333960	2334960	Erin's car has been stolen.
2334960	2335960	Right.
2335960	2336960	Because that's what we...
2336960	2337960	We'd already been to...
2337960	2338960	It was like, what?
2338960	2339960	Did you park in front of a driveway?
2339960	2340960	Went to the impound line?
2340960	2341960	No.
2342960	2344960	Okay, so that means that it's been stolen.
2344960	2348960	And then the last final thought from her was...
2349960	2351960	Oh, oh, it's been repossessed.
2352960	2353960	Was it really repossessed?
2353960	2355960	I guess so.
2355960	2357960	Kittens McTavish.
2359960	2361960	It's no fun. It's no fun to be poor.
2361960	2362960	Fucking A, it's not.
2362960	2365960	It's like the least fun thing next to being rich.
2366960	2367960	Oh, I know.
2367960	2370960	Those are the two least fun things in America in that order.
2370960	2372960	Being rich and being poor.
2372960	2373960	Why is being rich no fun?
2373960	2380960	Being rich is no fun because it actually turns out to be not as fun as when you were poor.
2380960	2382960	So then you get all bummed out.
2383960	2387960	Because you spend your entire time being poor craving being rich.
2387960	2390960	And so there's an extra depression to becoming rich.
2390960	2391960	There's a...
2394960	2397960	Slaughterhouse Five, Billy Pilgrim.
2398960	2399960	Like, there's a scene.
2399960	2401960	I don't know what you call it in a book.
2401960	2402960	A chapter.
2402960	2403960	A chapter.
2403960	2404960	I call it scenes.
2405960	2406960	Billy Pilgrim...
2406960	2407960	Fade up.
2407960	2417960	Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner of war and he finds himself eavesdropping on a group of Nazi soldiers discussing the imminent conquering of America.
2417960	2423960	They know they're in a war with all of Europe and that America has just joined and they're discussing.
2423960	2426960	Billy Pilgrim is Kurt Vonnegut's avatar.
2426960	2427960	He's the protagonist.
2427960	2431960	He's listening outside a window while he's shoveling shit as a prisoner of war.
2431960	2433960	He's listening to the Nazis discuss America.
2433960	2434960	And how are we going to get him?
2434960	2436960	How are we going to defeat him?
2436960	2441960	Like, what is the Nazis' point of view on America at the time of this war?
2441960	2446960	And it's just Kurt Vonnegut fucking riffing about America.
2446960	2448960	It has nothing to do with Nazism.
2448960	2449960	He doesn't give a shit.
2449960	2457960	He's using the Nazis as a work from work, like, looking in and commenting on all of it.
2457960	2460960	What do fascists think about America?
2460960	2463960	If you were a fascist country, how would you invade America?
2463960	2464960	How would you take it over?
2464960	2466960	How would they look at us?
2466960	2475960	And it's a naked, disgusting, invigorating look at capitalism through the fascist lens.
2475960	2479960	Turns out, not that much distortion.
2479960	2483960	Fascism, capitalism, they're compatible.
2483960	2486960	They both depend on the idea that there's a pyramid in place.
2486960	2489960	There's a bunch of people with a bunch of shit at the top.
2489960	2494960	And there's a bunch of way more people with a bunch less shit at the bottom.
2494960	2497960	And the way you move up is by turning people in.
2497960	2500960	The way you move up is by clawing over people.
2500960	2509960	The value at the top is defined by the amount of people that don't have as much at the bottom.
2509960	2511960	It's Mary Kay cosmetics.
2511960	2512960	It's Amway.
2512960	2513960	It's anything.
2513960	2515960	It's Scientology.
2515960	2518960	It's any organization that has traction.
2518960	2520960	This room.
2520960	2527960	There's been anecdotal things about professors who have studied this stuff in their classrooms.
2527960	2531960	There was a professor who started it as a joke.
2531960	2533960	He's like, okay, my name is The Wave.
2533960	2535960	And there's people who are in The Wave.
2535960	2538960	It was the equivalent of the Stanford Prison Experiment.
2538960	2541960	But it was an experiment in fascism.
2541960	2544960	I don't even know enough about this stuff.
2544960	2547960	But I know that we all are primates.
2547960	2552960	We all want desperately to not be excommunicated by each other.
2552960	2557960	And we all look to our left and look to our right and go, what am I doing wrong?
2557960	2559960	And is there any way to move up?
2559960	2565960	And sometimes that becomes very evident by the guy directly above you fucking up.
2565960	2567960	And you go, well, why is that guy above me?
2567960	2569960	He keeps fucking up.
2569960	2570960	Really?
2570960	2571960	He keeps fucking up?
2571960	2572960	Tell me more.
2572960	2574960	He keeps fucking up.
2574960	2576960	Well, would you like his job?
2576960	2577960	Yes, I would.
2577960	2578960	I would like his job.
2578960	2582960	I guess I'm a real hero.
2582960	2584960	Or you're a Nazi.
2584960	2586960	Depending on the context.
2586960	2590960	Depending on what's going down the conveyor belt at the bottom.
2590960	2597960	Are you measurably more or less happy having some money versus being poor?
2597960	2600960	It's so hard to fucking tell.
2600960	2607960	There's that documentary, there's this thing, it's like $40,000 a year or something.
2607960	2611960	You peek at your, that's how happy you are.
2611960	2616960	Anything beyond that, you're no more happy than anybody.
2616960	2618960	Poverty is depressing.
2618960	2623960	Not being able to pay for ramen noodles is depressing.
2623960	2627960	Being behind in your gas bills and having the government yell at you,
2627960	2631960	getting red envelopes in your mailbox and having people knock on your door
2631960	2633960	and go, what is the rent?
2633960	2636960	All of that affects your emotional level.
2636960	2640960	As Joey Lewis, the old comic said, money isn't everything, but it eases the nerves a little bit.
2640960	2641960	It sure helps.
2641960	2645960	But there's a certain point where those knocks stop and the red envelopes stop
2645960	2647960	and the ramen noodles are easy to buy.
2647960	2649960	You buy whatever the fuck you want.
2649960	2652960	And that number is around 40 grand a year or something like that.
2652960	2655960	It always changes because what the fuck do these numbers mean?
2655960	2656960	40 grand mean.
2656960	2658960	Don't know what that means.
2658960	2661960	But there's a level where it tops off.
2661960	2667960	And after that, you ain't ever going to be any happier than you are.
2667960	2672960	The happiness level, the serotonin level, the amount of good mood that you have,
2672960	2675960	it tops off fast.
2675960	2678960	If you know where your next meal's coming from,
2678960	2683960	and if you think like your girlfriend likes you,
2683960	2687960	there's a couple of minimal requirements you need to be really happy.
2687960	2692960	And then you could be making $8 million a week on top of that.
2692960	2695960	And all you're going to do is go, you're punching your girlfriend and going,
2695960	2699960	do you know what it's like to have $7 million a week to spare?
2699960	2703960	No, you don't make it any easier on me.
2703960	2705960	Why are you making it so hard?
2705960	2707960	Probes, how did you do it?
2707960	2709960	Probes, how do you handle having millions of dollars?
2710960	2715960	It's despicable how poor I am considering how awesome I am.
2715960	2717960	I think you're right though.
2717960	2720960	It's at the moment when you're really striving.
2720960	2726960	I was so desperately poor that when you have those moments where you go,
2726960	2730960	do I buy a pack of cigarettes or do I buy food today?
2730960	2732960	Or was that Susan Healy, a comic from San Francisco,
2732960	2734960	used to have a great line where she'd go,
2734960	2736960	the first thought you have when you wake up in the morning is,
2736960	2738960	what in my room can I sell?
2739960	2742960	And then that goes away.
2742960	2746960	But then I always think there's another kind of built-in unhappiness.
2746960	2750960	But what struck me when you were talking about that was,
2750960	2756960	more than simply being comfortable or having enough money to live,
2756960	2763960	is the psychopathy of people who have billions of dollars who won't desist.
2763960	2767960	What keeps you going at the Warren Buffett level?
2767960	2769960	What keeps you going at the Mitt Romney?
2769960	2770960	I can't wait to find out.
2770960	2771960	You know what I mean?
2771960	2773960	Yeah, that's what I keep asking myself.
2773960	2776960	Like, do they get up every morning and go, fuck, yeah, yeah.
2776960	2777960	I will say this to that.
2777960	2780960	Or do they get up and go like, fuck, I got a billion.
2780960	2784960	I bought a house last year with all of my anguish,
2784960	2786960	all of my sweat and all of my sadness.
2786960	2789960	There's a number value on the house that I bought,
2789960	2792960	and it's bigger than any house that in Milwaukee,
2792960	2794960	I was like, oh, I'm one of these people.
2794960	2796960	I'm a douche.
2796960	2804960	Details Magazine is doing a photo shoot called TV Mavericks.
2804960	2808960	So they invite me to a photo shoot.
2808960	2810960	It's some of the people that I love,
2810960	2812960	people that certainly make TV shows that I love.
2812960	2814960	I'm a TV maverick.
2814960	2816960	So I'm going to be Details Magazine.
2816960	2820960	They have procured a location.
2820960	2821960	We're going to shoot them.
2821960	2824960	It's going to make it look glamorous because they're mavericks.
2825960	2828960	I show up to this house.
2828960	2831960	I eventually ask the caretakers of the house,
2831960	2832960	what is this house worth?
2832960	2834960	$82.5 million.
2834960	2835960	No fucking way.
2835960	2839960	It's built into the side of a hill, and it was ridiculous.
2839960	2842960	The reason I bring this up is because I was walking around
2842960	2845960	that house, and I was starting to go, ah, fuck.
2845960	2848960	I should have put my toilet on the ceiling.
2848960	2849960	Yeah, yeah.
2849960	2850960	Jay did.
2850960	2851960	Jay did.
2851960	2853960	What kind of dumb dick am I?
2854960	2857960	Why don't I have an avocado server in my living room?
2857960	2859960	I didn't.
2859960	2861960	At no point was I having happiness.
2861960	2863960	I wasn't thinking.
2863960	2864960	Yeah, Lenny doesn't bring fun.
2864960	2865960	That's the weird thing.
2865960	2867960	I was just like, ah, fuck.
2867960	2868960	It's convenient to bring.
2868960	2869960	I have regular grass.
2869960	2872960	I don't have moss from the Amazon.
2872960	2874960	This guy has moss for grass.
2874960	2876960	The same amount of beer makes you drunk
2876960	2878960	and the same amount of, you know, anything?
2878960	2882960	I remember feeling like the king of the county
2882960	2886960	when I had enough money to buy myself dinner and somebody else.
2886960	2888960	Or enough for a burrito.
2888960	2891960	Or enough to buy myself a beer and tip the bartender.
2891960	2892960	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2892960	2895960	And not pay the 75 cents and the guy like 50 and like...
2895960	2897960	I have felt just as rich with $10 as I felt
2897960	2899960	with any other amount of money.
2899960	2902960	And that's a good perspective to have.
2902960	2905960	I think the happiest moment of my life is like 25 years ago
2905960	2907960	when my wife and I weren't married
2907960	2909960	and I got in a cab with her after a gig.
2909960	2911960	And I remember thinking she was the, you know,
2911960	2913960	the woman I wanted to be with and everything.
2913960	2915960	And that, to me, is the happiest moment of my life.
2915960	2919960	Not getting a big check or being on telly
2919960	2920960	or any of that fucking nonsense.
2920960	2921960	It certainly won't make your parents happy.
2921960	2924960	I remember telling my parents, like,
2924960	2925960	I made a bunch of money.
2925960	2926960	That's what you wanted, right?
2926960	2928960	And they were like, don't spend it all on one place.
2928960	2929960	Yeah.
2929960	2930960	I'm fucking cocksucker.
2930960	2931960	I'm fucking police.
2931960	2933960	I'm gonna murder you.
2933960	2936960	Dan, tell them about the Google map thing.
2936960	2937960	No, I want to tell them a better story.
2937960	2939960	I want to tell them about you.
2939960	2941960	When me and Shrob and you would hang out.
2941960	2942960	It's already a better story.
2942960	2944960	And we would hang out and think,
2944960	2947960	when we met Jeff, Jeff was a fucking vagabond,
2947960	2949960	a straight-up hobo.
2949960	2951960	And we were hanging out.
2951960	2953960	I had a soup can on my head
2953960	2954960	and a little flower coming out.
2954960	2958960	And wearing a barrel with suspenders on it.
2958960	2959960	I couldn't afford suspenders.
2959960	2960960	I didn't hold them up.
2960960	2961960	I had a bindle stiff.
2961960	2962960	Yeah.
2962960	2963960	I had a bindle on a stick.
2963960	2965960	We'd go over to Shrob's place and we'd rent a movie.
2965960	2968960	Back then, you rented movies from a geographic location
2968960	2973960	that housed movies in a weird matrix grid.
2973960	2977960	Oh, I want to watch young Frankenstein pulling it from a shelf
2977960	2981960	like young Frankenstein driving it to my Frankenstein player.
2981960	2984960	You guys don't understand what I'm talking about.
2984960	2986960	It was a weird era.
2986960	2988960	It was a lot more acquisition, yeah.
2988960	2990960	Walter Brennan still roamed the earth.
2990960	2991960	And we would do it.
2991960	2993960	Oh, my God, he sure did.
2994960	2996960	Jeff was a fun, charming guy that we knew in L.A.
2996960	2999960	Rob and I had just moved out from Milwaukee at six months ago.
2999960	3001960	I didn't know you guys were from Milwaukee.
3001960	3003960	We woke up one morning.
3003960	3004960	Jeff was gone.
3004960	3007960	There was a note on the coffee table that said...
3007960	3008960	Oh, boy.
3008960	3014960	Rob, Dan, tonight I did something
3014960	3018960	that I will never forgive myself for.
3018960	3021960	You guys left change on the table from Del Taco.
3021960	3023960	And I took it.
3023960	3026960	I took it because I'm broke.
3026960	3028960	I love you guys.
3028960	3030960	I'm ashamed of myself.
3030960	3033960	And I promise you I will give you this money back.
3033960	3036960	It was this beautifully written, like,
3036960	3038960	Herman Melville letter.
3038960	3040960	Rob was like, listen to this from Jeff.
3040960	3044960	And I was like, Jesus Christ, give him a fucking car.
3044960	3046960	What happened?
3046960	3048960	Yeah, we were all...
3048960	3051960	Jeff and I, I was into you for two grand at one point
3051960	3053960	and then you were into me and then back and forth.
3053960	3056960	Like, we would, like... God damn it.
3056960	3058960	You made Monster House and had a ton of money
3058960	3060960	and then like a year later you didn't have a nickel.
3060960	3061960	Yeah.
3061960	3063960	You bought Centipede and Pac-Man.
3063960	3067960	You had the full arcade stand up Centipedes and Pac-Man.
3067960	3070960	For real? You bought a Centipede and a Pac-Man?
3070960	3071960	Yeah.
3071960	3074960	And then he didn't have two quarters to shake together
3074960	3076960	a year later.
3076960	3077960	But he did have Pac-Man.
3077960	3080960	I've been a puppet, a power, a pirate, a pauver,
3080960	3083960	a pawn, and a king.
3083960	3084960	You need me guys.
3084960	3086960	And down, and over, and out.
3086960	3089960	I remember, like, when I left my...
3089960	3095960	The day before I got the call that I was going to be on Who's Land Is It Anyway?
3095960	3097960	I was evicted by the sheriff for my apartment
3097960	3099960	and I had to put everything I had on a trash bag
3099960	3104960	and I lied to a new landlord that I would have $1,000 in ten days.
3104960	3106960	I didn't have any money at all.
3106960	3108960	I had no prospects, none.
3108960	3111960	And I just completely lied and I was thrown out.
3111960	3113960	I left a bunch of shit at this place.
3113960	3115960	I really should go pay her back.
3115960	3116960	I never got...
3116960	3118960	She was kind of an asshole.
3118960	3120960	You were one of those guys, though, that was like...
3120960	3121960	What's going on over there?
3121960	3123960	And you're like, well, California law states that
3123960	3125960	you're only allowed to evict someone after...
3125960	3126960	Like, you knew...
3126960	3127960	You knew...
3127960	3129960	I was ducking and dodging, man.
3129960	3132960	And I had two trash bags of my most valuable things
3132960	3135960	and I went to this new place and the landlord was from London.
3135960	3139960	He goes, so, Jeff, I met you with your friend Matt before.
3139960	3140960	I'm back in ten days.
3140960	3144960	Just give me $1,000 first and last and you're good to go.
3144960	3146960	If you want, stay in my place until I get there
3146960	3148960	because the keys aren't ready for your back house.
3148960	3150960	There's a little shitty back house in Echo Park.
3150960	3152960	It was really cool, but it was real tiny.
3152960	3155960	So I'm in this guy's nice house and I got two trash bags
3155960	3161960	and all I had was the 45 cents I found in my couch.
3161960	3162960	Sweet.
3162960	3165960	And I knew that I could eat a burrito that night
3165960	3168960	and I was so happy about that and I put my bags down
3168960	3170960	and literally the phone rang and my manager, Tracy,
3170960	3171960	has been with me through thick and thin.
3171960	3173960	She goes, are you sitting down?
3173960	3174960	I was like, no.
3174960	3176960	No furniture.
3176960	3177960	Yes, no furniture.
3177960	3180960	I was in that guy's crib and I really, literally
3180960	3182960	had the trash bags with me because she goes,
3182960	3184960	I had been auditioning for Whose Line Is It Anyway
3184960	3186960	for three and a half years.
3186960	3187960	It was my fifth audition.
3187960	3191960	I fought against you from the beginning of the process.
3191960	3194960	I don't want to harsh this story at all.
3194960	3198960	You were a real admiral dark star.
3198960	3200960	And she goes, you got the thing.
3200960	3201960	And I go, when will they pay me?
3201960	3203960	She goes, you work on Tuesday.
3203960	3204960	You'll have the money in nine days,
3204960	3206960	the day before the guy got back.
3206960	3208960	And I was like, OK, cool.
3208960	3211960	And I hung up the phone and I hit the ground
3211960	3213960	like a sack of wet sock.
3213960	3215960	I went splat on the ground.
3215960	3217960	Not like, oh, lordy, lordy.
3217960	3218960	I just was out of energy.
3218960	3219960	I was like, that was it.
3219960	3220960	I was at the end of my tether.
3220960	3223960	And I was like, I can pay this motherfucker in 10 days.
3223960	3225960	I will be alive in 10 days.
3225960	3228960	And it was like a couple months later that everything was fine.
3228960	3230960	But it's a beautiful thing of getting right
3230960	3231960	to the end of that rope.
3231960	3234960	I was like, I don't want to go work at Starbucks.
3234960	3235960	I'll blow my brains out.
3235960	3236960	I can't do it.
3236960	3239960	Do you hear that, Starbucks employees?
3239960	3241960	You have another option.
3241960	3245960	Borrow it from Dan Harmon until it says no other recourse.
3245960	3247960	First of all, no.
3247960	3248960	Oh, shit.
3248960	3249960	Dan, you can.
3249960	3252960	Uh-oh.
3252960	3253960	Are you going to rap right now?
3253960	3254960	What the hell?
3254960	3255960	I think you're closing.
3255960	3256960	I thought we were closing.
3256960	3257960	I thought we were closing.
3257960	3258960	Are we closing?
3258960	3259960	Let's close.
3259960	3260960	No, no.
3260960	3261960	Let's close.
3261960	3262960	918?
3262960	3263960	No, we got to let's close.
3263960	3265960	We're in the 15-minute window for you guys to light it up.
3265960	3266960	Oh, no.
3266960	3269960	Let's just close.
3269960	3270960	There's going to be something different.
3270960	3271960	And we're not going to do a scene.
3271960	3272960	We're going to do something different.
3272960	3273960	All right?
3273960	3276960	Just give me a second.
3276960	3278960	I'm going to think of something.
3278960	3279960	There's no rush, baby.
3279960	3280960	All right.
3280960	3281960	No, no.
3281960	3282960	I know there's no rush.
3282960	3283960	Do you think?
3283960	3284960	You're rich.
3284960	3285960	You're rich and unhappy.
3285960	3287960	You're going to die.
3287960	3288960	All right.
3288960	3291960	Who in the audience is the least happy?
3291960	3293960	Well, Adam Goldberg.
3293960	3295960	Adam Goldberg's had his hand up.
3295960	3296960	Yeah.
3296960	3298960	Well, okay.
3298960	3301960	Hold on.
3301960	3305960	Adam, why are you unhappy?
3305960	3310960	Just talking to us.
3310960	3315960	For podcasters at home, I hit myself in the face with a microphone while being interviewed
3315960	3318960	about why I'm unhappy.
3318960	3323960	So I thought I wasn't going to be fired for my job because my supervisor left at seven
3323960	3324960	last weekend.
3324960	3325960	I worked overnight.
3325960	3329960	And then I walk in today, and she's holding the transcription pedal I brought from home
3329960	3332960	and a paycheck with $90 deducted out of it.
3332960	3336960	And she's like, oh, yeah, I meant to email you, but I didn't get around to it.
3336960	3337960	So I keep tracking it off.
3337960	3338960	That's been our show, everybody.
3338960	3339960	Thanks for coming.
3339960	3340960	Have a great night.
3340960	3341960	Okay.
3341960	3342960	All right.
3342960	3343960	Adam, come up on stage.
3343960	3345960	Come up on stage.
3345960	3346960	Adam Goldberg, right?
3346960	3347960	Yeah.
3347960	3348960	Adam Goldberg, everyone.
3348960	3350960	Wasn't he?
3350960	3353960	He's become something of a mascot for Harman Town.
3353960	3354960	All right.
3354960	3355960	All right.
3355960	3356960	It's Bergy and mascot.
3356960	3357960	Mascot?
3358960	3363960	We're going to try to end with a scene called Adam's Valhalla.
3364960	3368960	Adam, this is a world where everything that you say goes.
3368960	3369960	Okay.
3369960	3374960	The rest of us, like, you have a microphone.
3374960	3378960	You stand there, and you're like a god in this world.
3378960	3381960	And the rest of us will obey your whim.
3381960	3387960	The year is 2012.
3387960	3391960	It is September 2012.
3391960	3396960	An attractive woman comes up to me and says, oh, your spine looks normal and not weird.
3396960	3397960	Is that a hunch?
3397960	3398960	Oh.
3398960	3402960	Or are you just being a sex monster?
3402960	3404960	I have a hunch that I am a sex monster.
3404960	3407960	I'd like to yield to you almost immediately.
3407960	3410960	My name's Yolanda.
3410960	3412960	I have a size 18 waist.
3412960	3414960	Get going.
3415960	3417960	Let's make it size 20.
3417960	3418960	Now...
3419960	3421960	I just expanded.
3424960	3428960	I'm trying to be the straight man.
3428960	3431960	This is like my giggly tendencies and puffed out cheeks.
3431960	3432960	No, don't be the straight man.
3432960	3434960	No, no, absolutely.
3434960	3437960	In my perfect world, I see my buddy Dan Harman.
3437960	3441960	He's combed his hair for the very first time just on my account.
3442960	3445960	I'm with you, Adam, on that one, man.
3445960	3447960	By the way, I didn't.
3447960	3448960	Whatever you're saying.
3448960	3449960	No, this is my fantasy world.
3449960	3451960	He's trying to get you to comb your hair a while ago.
3451960	3452960	I'm trying to fantasy.
3452960	3457960	I thought this was the best way that I thought I could give you a slight personal grooming tip list
3457960	3460960	and Harman town.
3460960	3464960	I can only get through to you through podcasts.
3464960	3466960	Mistakes are that high for you.
3466960	3467960	I'm not psycho.
3467960	3468960	No, you're God right now.
3468960	3469960	You're God.
3469960	3470960	You're a short psycho.
3470960	3473960	If Dan Harman doesn't look good, I don't look good.
3474960	3476960	Easy a lot, though.
3476960	3477960	All right, Adam.
3477960	3478960	What else?
3478960	3479960	What can we do?
3479960	3480960	I don't...
3480960	3481960	I just...
3481960	3482960	I'm a simple man.
3482960	3485960	I'd like that, you know, the rag that you used to wash your car.
3485960	3487960	I mean, the rag a person would...
3487960	3488960	I doubt you.
3488960	3490960	Greg, you've washed your own car, yeah?
3490960	3491960	Do I what?
3491960	3492960	Have you washed your own car ever?
3492960	3493960	I have done, yes.
3493960	3496960	You know, if you buy, like, one of those discount rags you wash and then...
3496960	3497960	You can't use that rag again.
3497960	3498960	It's too...
3498960	3502960	I just want, like, a car rag that you can reuse.
3502960	3503960	I'm down.
3503960	3504960	I'm down.
3504960	3505960	It looks so curious.
3505960	3506960	It's the one you use...
3506960	3507960	The one you use...
3507960	3508960	You use it and then you're like, oh, I'll wring it out.
3508960	3510960	And then it's like, it's all grained.
3510960	3513960	I don't want to put that on my car again, even if it's clean.
3513960	3514960	Exactly.
3514960	3518960	To dream the impossible dream.
3518960	3522960	All right, so you used to wash my car where the dust always goes.
3522960	3523960	What?
3523960	3524960	You can't do it.
3524960	3526960	I live in the valley.
3526960	3527960	It is very dusty.
3527960	3528960	Am I right?
3528960	3529960	Keep going, you motherfucker.
3529960	3539960	I had an odd dream to wash out that car, to be employed with health benefits for my spine.
3539960	3545960	To dream, I do not have as pictures, I'm weird.
3545960	3548960	There is a difference.
3548960	3551960	My voice is cracking.
3551960	3552960	That's been Harman Town, you guys.
3552960	3553960	Thanks for coming.
3553960	3554960	Adam Goldberg.
3554960	3555960	Dreaming big.
3555960	3556960	Thank you so much.
3556960	3566960	One more time for Craig Croupes, everybody, would you?

3585960	3587960	I've been Jeff Davis, our comptroller.
3587960	3593960	One more time for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
3593960	3594960	Thank you so much.
3594960	3597960	I hope all of your cars have not been towed.
3597960	3605960	And when you get into your car, I urge you to reach down between your legs and ease the
3605960	3608960	seat bag.
3608960	3609960	Thank you.
