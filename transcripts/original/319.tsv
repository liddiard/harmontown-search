0	10720	From downtown Los Angeles, or downtown, pardon me, I've got a frog in my throat.
10720	18440	From downtown Los Angeles, Harmanstown is once again in session.
18440	20960	Don't think of it as losing a Spencer.
20960	21960	Think of it as gaming.
21960	41320	Let's bring out the mayor of Harmanstown.
41320	42320	You know him if you like him.
42320	43320	His name is Dan Harmon.
43320	44320	Thank you.
44320	45320	Thank you.
45320	46320	Thank you for coming.
46320	47320	My name is Mr. Drummond.
47320	48320	I got a different trope for you.
48320	49320	It's called fucking in your mama.
49320	50320	What you gonna do?
50320	51320	All right.
51320	52320	Come on.
52320	63000	My future mother-in-law is here tonight.
63000	70480	Let's not rap about fucking people's mamas.
70480	71480	The marriage is on.
71480	72480	It's happening.
72480	73640	I got my ring.
73640	75040	It got resized.
75040	82760	My fianc√©, she sneakily behind my back because she's like, there's always a challenge.
82760	84240	How do you know their ring size?
84240	88640	Well, if they're divorced, you get the last ring.
88640	95600	Which I had already thrown into the cracks of doom as I was told to do by Gandalf.
95600	96800	It was not unmade there.
96800	98840	No, Levy like conspired behind my back.
98840	104120	They had my old wedding ring and they, but I get either marriage like either makes your
104120	109680	knuckles bigger, like you flex your wedding.
109680	110680	It didn't fit.
110680	111680	It was too tight.
111680	112680	I don't know what happened.
112680	113680	I got it.
113680	114680	I hope it's muscle.
114680	118000	I hope I gained muscle, but I needed it to be whitened.
118000	120160	You got that Dave Klein finger muscle going on.
120160	121160	Yeah.
121160	122160	I think that's what it was.
122160	123600	Anyways, it's on my finger now.
123600	126800	It's only mildly distracting.
126800	132920	I twist it and I play with it and, uh, I'll never take it off.
132920	133920	Gross.
133920	134920	Oh, hi Rob.
134920	143880	I haven't seen you in months.
143880	144880	How are you?
144880	145920	I'm fine.
145920	148240	Why haven't you been on the show lately?
148240	149240	I don't know.
149240	151200	When was the last time he asked me to come on?
151200	153200	Are people supposed to invite you every week?

163200	164200	You just did.
164200	165200	Yes.
165200	166200	Okay.
166200	167200	Well, I've said it before.
167200	168200	When?

177600	178600	Let me get that.
178600	179600	Oh, shit.
179600	183000	Oh, that was too much.
183000	184000	Too much.
185000	187000	So keep your eye on him.
187000	190000	Terrible impression of me.
190000	192000	I don't act like that.
192000	196000	Uh, I only have one thing to talk about and then we'll bring up our guests.
196000	199000	So tonight, tonight's an emotionally complicated night.
199000	203000	So like, run out, scalp your tickets while you can.
203000	206000	It's an emotionally complicated night.
206000	208000	Uh, uh, 911 operators.
208000	212000	I, I, I'm a, I'm a true crime podcast listener.
212000	215000	Uh, we have a 911 operator.
215000	216000	Okay.
216000	217000	Yeah.
217000	221000	You're, you're, you're like my favorite topic too.
221000	227000	Uh, the, the, the, I just don't, you listen to true crime podcasts.
227000	231000	Like, what do you, what do you, Jeff, call me with an emergency.
231000	232000	All right.
232000	234000	Uh, uh, hello.
234000	235000	911.
235000	236000	What's your emergency?
236000	241000	I, I'm, uh, sir, you need to calm down.
242000	244000	Just tell me what's going on.
244000	246000	I think there's a burglar downstairs.
246000	248000	Uh, sir, I understand, but you need to calm down.
248000	249000	Hold on.
249000	250000	911.
250000	251000	What's your emergency?
251000	253000	Hey, I'm burglar in his house.
253000	255000	Sir, you need to calm down.
255000	259000	Hey, I'm going to, I'm going to burglar your house after I get done here.
262000	266000	My, my bit's been superseded by a more,
266000	270000	a much more interesting bit that I'd rather do, but I don't know what to.
270000	273000	Uh, sir, you need to give me the candelabra.
273000	274000	Okay, okay.
274000	275000	All right.
275000	276000	Okay, can you hold?
276000	277000	No problem.
277000	278000	Uh, sir.
278000	279000	Yeah.
279000	280000	Are you talking to my burglar right now?
280000	282000	Sir, you need to, you need.
282000	283000	Hey, I'm burglar for you.
283000	284000	I'm in the other room.
284000	285000	Yeah.
285000	286000	Yeah.
286000	289000	Can I, can I get a word in edgewise with my 911 dispatch?
289000	290000	Oh, okay.
290000	291000	All right.
291000	292000	Yeah.
292000	293000	You need to turn your radio down.
293000	294000	What?
294000	296000	I, I'm not calling it on a radio show.
296000	297000	I'm calling.
297000	298000	I'm calling.
298000	299000	Millennials probably don't know about that.
299000	304000	Cause it was like the, the, the radio, like all radio, like local radio.
304000	306000	They're like, all right, it's about five o'clock.
306000	308000	We're playing all the hits of the airsmiths coming up.
308000	309000	What do you want?
309000	313000	And it was like nine times out of 10, it'd be like, Hey, hey, my name is Dave.
313000	314000	Jay, Jay.
314000	315000	What's up?
315000	316000	What are you going to get?
316000	317000	I got to turn that radio down.
317000	320000	You got, I know it's exciting to be on the radio, but you gotta, if it's on,
320000	322000	while you're on the phone, then the,
322000	325000	then the radio's going to go into this microphone of the phone and then we're
325000	327000	going to be listening to you, listening to you.
327000	331000	It's a, it's a tough thing to, it's kind of a Christopher Nolan thing, but,
331000	334000	uh, you gotta, you gotta fucking figure it out.
334000	337000	Like be a professional, mute that radio,
337000	341000	talk to us as if we're no big deal and then we'll, you'll sound good for
341000	342000	everybody else.
342000	345000	Sir, this guy's burglarizing my home right now.
345000	347000	Sir, I need you to calm down.
347000	351000	I fucking, you seem more, more stressed out than I am.
351000	355000	I'm just, I'm in my closet hiding and I, I have a weapon.
355000	359000	If you listen to true crime podcasts for a year, I,
359000	363000	I now feel like if something happens to me,
363000	366000	if I come home and Cody has lost an arm,
366000	369000	I'm I like, I'm going to try to figure out,
369000	374000	I'm going to like Google what to do if you lose an arm before calling 9-1-1
374000	381000	because I don't want to end up like having the recording of me pondered over
381000	382000	by people.
382000	384000	Oh, he doesn't sound very upset.
384000	386000	I think he cut off her arm.
386000	390000	But if you call them and go like, like, like, oh my God.
390000	391000	Oh my God.
391000	393000	My girlfriend's arm got cut off.
393000	396000	Like, sir, sir, sir.
396000	397000	Calm down.
397000	399000	Now what's your address?
399000	400000	Oh my God.
400000	402000	It's one, two, three, four on the fiction street.
402000	403000	I don't know.
403000	406000	Like, sir, sir.
406000	408000	Like, why are you still chastising me?
408000	409000	Can't wait.
409000	411000	After the point where you get the address and your,
411000	413000	and the ambulance is on the way.
413000	418000	Can I have permission to freak out about the dead body I found?
418000	422000	And or do I have your permission to be enough on the spectrum
422000	425000	that the one thing I'm good at is calling 9-1-1?
425000	430000	I'm so sick of this fucking like, oh, he said, listen to this 9-1-1 calling.
430000	432000	It just seems a little weird.
432000	434000	Hello, 9-1-1.
434000	435000	Yeah.
435000	438000	My children are missing.
438000	440000	Your children are missing?
440000	441000	Yeah.
441000	445000	They're missing and it's noon now and I haven't seen him since 11-30.
445000	447000	And then they're just like, like going up and saying,
447000	449000	oh, he sounds like a robot.
449000	450000	Oh, he's a robot.
450000	451000	What is a robot?
451000	453000	Fuck everyone.
453000	454000	I'm never calling 9-1-1.
454000	459000	I'm going to do something wrong.
459000	463000	Dan, who have you killed?
463000	465000	I'm never going to kill anybody but...
465000	469000	You are and you're...
469000	472000	It's only a matter of time before we're all adjacent to a murder.
472000	474000	God forbid.
474000	479000	I just don't think it's fair that people like analyze how you respond to a trauma.
479000	480000	Right.
480000	481000	I also like...
481000	482000	Here's the thing.
482000	483000	We're going to have our...
483000	486000	Look, if you're a big fan of our podcast and you just want...
486000	489000	I'm not like an Oprah or like picture pages thing where I'm like,
489000	490000	you have to listen to this.
490000	497000	But you should know, in March, the Red Handed podcast ladies are coming out
498000	499000	from Jolly England.
499000	502000	They're going to come out and be our guests.
502000	504000	And so like you have that heads up, like maybe...
504000	506000	What are we talking about?
506000	508000	Get addicted to that podcast.
508000	512000	Wonderful, best true crime podcast I've heard ever recently.
512000	513000	And...
513000	516000	The Red Ladies from England?
516000	517000	God damn it.
517000	518000	Like, all right.
518000	519000	Forget it.
519000	520000	Let's just move on.
520000	521000	What is happening?
521000	524000	How long have I been gone?
524000	528000	Your beard is gray and long.
528000	534000	Jeff, you seem so much further away than usual.
539000	544000	One thing that I like about their podcast.
544000	547000	The Red Handed podcast, which is a true crime podcast.
547000	549000	The Red Handed...
549000	550000	It's called Red Handed.
550000	551000	Figure it out.
551000	552000	Wait, you're an adult.
552000	553000	Oh, okay.
553000	554000	I'm thinking mittens.
554000	555000	I'm sorry.
555000	556000	Red Handed.
556000	557000	You're thinking mittens?
557000	558000	Yeah, I...
558000	559000	Why?
559000	560000	Why are you thinking mittens?
560000	562000	I have a pair of red mittens.
562000	564000	That's why I'm thinking of it.
564000	566000	Listen to yourself.
566000	571000	You sound like you...
571000	576000	Sir, you need to calm down.
576000	577000	I've come home.
577000	581000	My father drank a weird lemonade.
581000	582000	All right.
582000	585000	Anyways, the thing I like about...
585000	587000	One of the many things I like about their podcast
587000	590000	is that every single time a lie detector comes up,
590000	592000	it's time to open...
592000	594000	We have to revolt against this...
594000	596000	Lie detectors are bullshit.
596000	597000	It's bullshit.
597000	598000	Who did you kill?
598000	599000	You killed somebody.
599000	601000	There's a body that you're...
601000	602000	Never killed anybody.
602000	604000	Never gonna kill anybody.
604000	606000	And at some point in my life before I die,
606000	611000	I will be somehow misconstrued and judged
611000	613000	because of my affect.
613000	616000	And whether it's like I fail a polygraph test
616000	620000	or I refuse to take one, which is like,
620000	621000	oh, that's weird.
621000	623000	He refused to take a polygraph test.
623000	627000	Everyone, please refuse to take every polygraph test.
627000	628000	They mean nothing.
628000	632000	It's the amateurs that screw it up for the rest of us.
633000	636000	The amateur polygraph administrators?
638000	640000	Or do you mean...
640000	641000	Or amateur liars.
641000	642000	Yeah, yeah.
642000	643000	All right, look.
643000	644000	Take your pick.
644000	646000	I can see it's gonna be one of those shows.
646000	649000	Dan, look me in the eye.
649000	652000	I know a few of the main five tells
652000	653000	when you're telling them.
653000	654000	About lying.
654000	655000	Yeah.
655000	656000	Okay.
656000	657000	So you're like a human polygraph.
657000	658000	I'm gonna ask you a question
658000	659000	that we both know the answer to.
659000	662000	I want you to tell me the wrong answer.
663000	664000	Okay.
666000	667000	What's your middle name?
667000	668000	James.
669000	670000	Yeah.
670000	671000	You already did...
671000	672000	You did two of the tells.
672000	673000	All right.
673000	674000	You already...
677000	678000	Two of the what kind of tells?
678000	679000	Lies.
679000	680000	That's my name.
680000	682000	You asked me what my middle name was.
682000	683000	No, no.
683000	684000	I told you to do it wrong.
684000	685000	I told you to lie.
685000	687000	Well, I didn't lie.
687000	688000	I was testing you.
688000	689000	I told you to lie.
689000	691000	And I told the truth and revealed
691000	693000	that you don't know the difference.
694000	696000	You're supposed to give the wrong answer.
696000	698000	And when you think I'm lying...
698000	699000	And you confidently told me...
699000	700000	You perceive it as a lie.
700000	701000	Okay, so now...
701000	702000	That's the biggest fucking...
702000	703000	I'm nailed it.
703000	705000	So now lie to me.
705000	706000	I promise to lie to you.
706000	707000	Okay.
713000	715000	What day is today?
715000	716000	Three.
717000	718000	I swear to God.
719000	720000	I fucking swear to God.
721000	722000	Strike me with lightning.
722000	724000	If it's not three today.
724000	726000	What is your mother's maiden name?
726000	727000	Yellow.
728000	729000	You see, you're going to jail.
729000	730000	With an E.
730000	731000	You killed somebody.
731000	732000	I'm going to jail?
732000	733000	You killed somebody.
733000	734000	I killed nobody.
734000	735000	I didn't kill anybody.
735000	737000	Spencer isn't here tonight.
740000	741000	Did you kill Spencer?
741000	743000	Polygraph chests are garbage.
743000	744000	You killed Spencer.
744000	746000	You're trying to get out in front of this 9-11 call
746000	747000	in your lie detector test
747000	749000	because you murdered Spencer.
751000	753000	And while you hesitate...
754000	756000	You have the right to remain silent.
757000	759000	Look, my first guest...
761000	766000	Millennials know her as Ida Blankenship from Mad Men.
766000	767000	Right.
767000	769000	Gen Xers know her as Mama LaRusso.
769000	770000	I know her as my...
770000	771000	From The Karate Kid.
771000	772000	Right.
772000	774000	I know her as my future mother-in-law.
774000	777000	Can you please welcome Randy Heller to the stage?
785000	786000	Randy Heller?
798000	799000	Have a seat.
799000	800000	Have a seat.
802000	804000	How many days did you work on Karate Kid?
804000	807000	How many days of a shoot was that for you as Mama LaRusso?
808000	810000	You don't have your call sheet?
812000	814000	I guess I worked about three, four weeks or something.
814000	815000	Oh, yeah?
815000	816000	Is this working?
816000	817000	Yeah.
817000	818000	You got to eat that mic, though.
818000	819000	Oh.
821000	823000	Well, I guess let's get this out of the way.
823000	824000	I want to cement this.
824000	826000	I've mentioned it before.
826000	829000	It's been a theory, but I want to make it a technical fact.
829000	831000	As of your daughter proposing to me,
831000	837000	I am now officially and technically a Karate Kid in law.
837000	838000	That's right.
840000	841000	In every way that matters.
841000	842000	My son.
842000	843000	Yeah.
843000	844000	To be.
844000	845000	Yeah.
845000	846000	No, you're already my son.
846000	847000	And you're stoked about it, right?
847000	848000	I'm very.
848000	850000	Because you know that I love you.
850000	851000	You know that.
851000	852000	We've determined that.
852000	853000	Not at first, no.
853000	854000	Not so much.
854000	855000	It wasn't.
855000	859000	It wasn't love at first sight, but he's grown on me.
859000	860000	Like a fungus.
860000	867000	A lot of me joining your family is learning what love really is.
867000	870000	I mean, my relationship with Cody, I'm like, oh, that's what love.
870000	871000	Oh, shit.
871000	875000	Like, there's no knocking on any previous relationship I've ever had.
875000	878000	I just sort of like, and then I join your family.
878000	880000	You guys really love each other.
880000	887000	It's really, it can be alienating and dizzying to an astronaut from the vacuum.
887000	888000	I can't understand that.
888000	889000	Yeah.
889000	890000	Yeah.
890000	892000	But don't count yourself in you just yet.
892000	893000	No, no, no, I won't.
893000	894000	All right.
894000	896000	Just want to, you know, step by step.
896000	897000	Yeah.
897000	898000	That makes me comfortable.
898000	901000	I like knowing that there's like airlocks and like conditions.
901000	903000	That makes me comfortable.
903000	909000	Like for instance, like I remember distinctly very shortly into me dating Cody, which was
909000	912000	a pretty intense rebound.
912000	914000	I can say that now that it's like permanent.
914000	917000	I mean, there was no indications.
917000	925000	I was like, I was dating Cody very quickly after the divorce of my last relationship,
925000	927000	which made both of us ponder things.
927000	929000	Anyway, put a pin in my view on this.
929000	932000	This is about you.
932000	935000	You had this apartment in New York or you were staying at Cody's apartment in New York.
935000	936000	Yes.
936000	942000	And I went to visit her on her first show because she did this show called Deadbeat
942000	943000	for three seasons.
943000	944000	Right.
944000	945000	And I went to visit her.
945000	946000	You don't have to plug me.
946000	947000	I'm getting up.
947000	948000	Okay, good.
948000	949000	It's Cody.
949000	950000	Cody.
950000	951000	Come out here.
951000	952000	Not now, Cody.
952000	953000	I feel much safer.
953000	954000	Come out, Cody.
954000	955000	No, she doesn't have to.
955000	956000	Cody!
956000	957000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
957000	958000	All right.
958000	961000	I'm totally in love with this child.
961000	962000	Hi, everyone.
962000	967000	Cuz, grab a seat and grab a mic.
967000	971000	So, um, she got this show and she's on this show.
971000	972000	Eat that mic.
972000	973000	Huh?
973000	974000	Eat it.
974000	975000	Eat it.
975000	976000	Okay.
976000	977000	Ah.
977000	980640	So, she gets the show and I'm like thrilled.
980640	982840	My kid has her own show.
982840	987320	And so I went to New York to visit her and it's cold in New York.
987320	993640	So I bought a lot of stuff to warm myself, because it's freezing, a hat, gloves, coat.
993640	994640	Okay, but first...
994640	995640	Wait.
995640	996640	Hold on.
996640	997640	Okay.
997640	998640	All right.
998640	999640	See what it's like to be...
999640	1000640	This is what...
1000640	1001640	But you brought her out.
1001640	1002640	I know.
1002640	1003640	You brought me out.
1003640	1004640	So, if this gets frustrating...
1004640	1005640	Get back in there.
1005640	1006640	Yeah.
1006640	1007640	Like...
1007640	1008640	So, should I continue the scarf?
1008640	1009640	Yeah, I did, yeah.
1009640	1010640	All right.
1010640	1013040	So, I bought this huge scarf to keep me warm.
1013040	1014040	Oh, jeez.
1014040	1015040	Okay.
1015040	1016040	Here it is.
1016040	1017040	I'm on my own, right?
1017040	1018040	Continue.
1018040	1019040	It's a scarf story.
1019040	1020040	All right.
1020040	1026720	So, I bought this enormous long white and black scarf to keep my neck warm.
1026720	1027720	And...
1027720	1028720	It was not that cute.
1028720	1033560	Like, you tried it on and we looked at it and we both agreed it wasn't that cute.
1033560	1034560	Or...
1034560	1035560	I at least...
1035560	1036560	Okay.
1036560	1037560	I at least thought that...
1037560	1038560	Really?
1038560	1039560	There was contention about the scarf.
1039560	1041800	Oh, so there was initial contention?
1041800	1042800	I...
1042800	1043800	Okay.
1043800	1044800	You...
1044800	1045800	Tell your version of it.
1045800	1046800	You shouldn't have brought me out here.
1047560	1048560	Just tell the scarf story.
1048560	1049560	All right.
1049560	1053900	So, I got all dressed up and I'm supposed to meet her for lunch or breakfast, whatever
1053900	1054900	it was.
1054900	1059240	So, I put everything on knowing that I'm gonna go out in, like, really freezing temperature.
1059240	1060240	Big long scarf.
1060240	1061240	Now, when?
1061240	1063360	Big long fucking scarf.
1063360	1065120	So, I...
1065120	1070400	You know, when you go on vacation, you're kind of off your routine, like, going to the bathroom
1070400	1072880	in the morning, you know, like, at home, 8 o'clock?
1072880	1075080	I'm talking about constipation irregularity.
1075080	1076080	Yeah.
1076080	1077080	Right.
1077080	1081280	It's like vacation altered poop, you know.
1081280	1083880	So, VAP, we call it in my family.
1083880	1088360	We have a thing called VAPs, which was supposed to be an acronym, but it actually isn't because
1088360	1090360	vacation induced...
1090360	1091360	No.
1091360	1092360	What is it?
1092360	1093360	What is it?
1093360	1094360	Altered poop.
1094360	1095360	No, that's not it.
1095360	1098120	So, in other words, instead of going to the bathroom at 8 o'clock when you're on vacation,
1098120	1099120	you're off.
1099120	1100120	You're off your routine.
1100120	1101120	Yeah.
1101120	1103520	So, I got all dressed up and I didn't go to the bathroom yet.
1103520	1104520	Nobody's...
1104520	1105520	Nobody's...
1105960	1108080	When you're regular, you don't go, it's 8 o'clock.
1108080	1109080	This is when I poop.
1109080	1110080	Like, that's not...
1110080	1111080	No.
1111080	1114120	Like, every morning, about 8 o'clock, I have to take a dump.
1114120	1115120	Okay.
1115120	1116120	All right.
1116120	1117120	All right.
1117120	1118120	Fine.
1118120	1119120	What's wrong with that?
1119120	1120120	No, there's nothing wrong with that.
1120120	1123320	That's why I always feel like I'm constipated, because you've made it seem to be like it
1123320	1126200	was going to be this thing that happened every day to give in time, and it's not for me
1126200	1127200	at all.
1127200	1128200	Okay.
1128200	1131280	I'm just saying, like, I think that's part of why I always get constipated, because I
1131280	1134920	put this pressure on myself, like, oh, it's not...
1134920	1135920	Sometimes a parenting fail.
1135920	1137680	Like, you should have done better.
1137680	1138680	Something happened there.
1138680	1139680	You know what I'm saying?
1139680	1140680	I feel so bad now.
1140680	1141880	I feel so guilty.
1141880	1145840	Something happened with my butthole that I have stuff going on with that, you know?
1145840	1147880	I got my first hemorrhoid, I told you.
1147880	1148880	I sent you a picture.
1148880	1149880	I sent you a picture.
1149880	1155880	Remember, I sent you a close-up on a group text to her and my sister, because...
1155880	1157880	Well, I wanted to know for sure what it was.
1157880	1159880	You sent your mother a picture of your hemorrhoid?
1159880	1161880	Yeah, and then Dan saw it, too.
1161880	1163880	Oh, these guys, yeah.
1163880	1164880	Just lovely.
1164880	1165880	Yeah.
1165880	1166880	You liked it.
1166880	1167880	All right.
1167880	1168880	So, like, let's just...
1168880	1169880	You still liked it, though.
1169880	1170880	I thought we were gonna get this story, though.
1170880	1173560	I'm fine with the seat roof, but I want to keep the train on rails.
1173560	1177760	To be fair, guys, we warned you, this is gonna be an emotionally intense episode.
1177760	1178760	Hold on.
1178760	1179760	So, you...
1179760	1180760	Oh.
1180760	1181760	Right goose?
1181760	1182760	Yeah.
1182760	1183760	That's good.
1183760	1184760	Uh-oh.
1184760	1185760	All right.
1185760	1186760	Well...
1186760	1187760	Mom, I'm finished the story.
1187760	1188760	I need help.
1188760	1189760	I need some help.
1189760	1190760	Can we...
1190760	1191760	Back up?
1191760	1192760	Can we...
1192760	1193760	Back up?
1194640	1195640	I feel like we don't even need...
1195640	1196640	Come back on again.
1196640	1200520	The way that she's told whatever she just told about that, we can not talk about that
1200520	1201520	for a second.
1201520	1204000	Go back to what you were talking about was, like, the first time that you guys met.
1204000	1205000	No, that doesn't matter.
1205000	1206000	We've accelerated...
1206000	1207000	She's halfway through the scarf story.
1207000	1208000	I won't...
1208000	1209000	All right, fine.
1209000	1210000	We'll go back.
1210000	1211000	We'll go back.
1211000	1212000	Hold on to the poop story.
1212000	1213000	Hold on.
1213000	1214000	Hold on.
1214000	1215000	Go ahead.
1215000	1216000	No.
1216000	1217000	All right.
1217000	1218000	Okay, okay.
1218000	1219000	I fucked it up.
1219000	1220000	I fucked it up.
1220000	1221000	I took a shit in your apartment here.
1221000	1222000	Your mom was like, it's fine.
1222000	1223760	I'm gonna fight right here on the stage.
1223760	1224760	And I'm gonna love this.
1224760	1225760	Okay, okay, okay.
1225760	1226760	Damn it.
1226760	1227760	The fucking scarf story was like...
1227760	1228760	Mom, scarf story, continue.
1228760	1231560	You met with the goddess and now it's off the rails.
1231560	1233560	It's such a good story.
1233560	1234560	You gotta...
1234560	1235560	Build it up.
1235560	1236560	Okay, okay.
1236560	1237560	I'm gonna catch everybody up.
1237560	1238560	All right, catch them up.
1238560	1239560	Yes, dear.
1239560	1240560	All right.
1240560	1243560	Previously on the scarf story.
1243560	1245240	Mom is visiting New York.
1245240	1246880	She bought an outfit.
1246880	1248880	She got this long scarf.
1248880	1251480	Daughter, not into it.
1251480	1253240	That's all right.
1253240	1259240	Getting dressed to go meet the daughter and then an unscheduled visitor.
1259240	1260240	Unscheduled?
1260240	1261240	The poop.
1261240	1262240	Yeah.
1262240	1265560	Like, you know, your stomach starts to like turn and I'm going, oh fuck.
1265560	1267040	It's eight and 12 o'clock.
1267040	1268040	New York time.
1268040	1269720	I'm way off my schedule.
1269720	1271320	I gotta go to the bathroom.
1271320	1274400	So it's like time to go meet you.
1274400	1277720	And I said, well, I'm not gonna take all my clothes off my scarf, my hat, my gloves.
1277720	1279520	I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
1279520	1291280	So I went and it was a mess because I got up and the scarf went into the toilet.
1291280	1296720	My $150 scarf into the, into the potpourri.
1296720	1299040	And you had shit on top of it.
1299040	1300040	Yeah, no.
1300040	1301520	Now the shit is all over the scarf.
1301520	1305720	The scarf had gone into the toilet and you shit on top of it.
1305720	1306720	Okay.
1306720	1307720	I walk in.
1307720	1309000	No, I didn't shit on top.
1309000	1310000	It was already shit in there.
1310000	1311000	Shit on the scarf.
1311000	1312000	Yeah.
1312000	1313000	I didn't shit on the scarf.
1313000	1314000	What do you mean there was shit already in there?
1314000	1315000	I shit and when I got the scarf.
1315000	1316000	Well, how would there be shit already in there?
1316000	1317000	Wait a minute.
1317000	1319840	No, because I got up in the scarf because it was so long, went into the toilet.
1319840	1320840	Aw.
1320840	1321840	What do you mean?
1321840	1326480	I thought before you sat, the scarf went into the toilet and then you took a big dump on
1326480	1327480	the scarf.
1327480	1328480	Right.
1328480	1329480	Yeah.
1329480	1330480	Right.
1330480	1331480	You're saying the same thing.
1331480	1332480	You're saying the same thing now.
1332480	1333480	Was saying the same thing.
1333480	1334480	Yeah.
1334480	1335480	Okay.
1335480	1336480	Okay.
1336480	1337480	Oh my God.
1337480	1338480	I thought the...
1338480	1339480	Shit on the scarf.
1339480	1340480	Shit on the scarf.
1340480	1343040	And just, it had fringe, fringes.
1343040	1346360	So all the fringes were...
1346360	1349200	So I got up and I went all the way down.
1349200	1350920	I feel like I walked in during some of this.
1350920	1351920	No.
1351920	1352920	You were gone.
1352920	1353920	You were gone.
1353920	1354920	Okay.
1354920	1357760	Well, if I had seen this, I would have flipped the fuck out because I remember...
1357760	1358760	Wait.
1358760	1362520	In the apartment, I remember how I was just always mad at you for making messes.
1362520	1363520	Right.
1363520	1364520	I would have flipped out if I knew that...
1364520	1365520	She would have.
1365520	1366520	So you were trying to hide it from me.
1366520	1367520	But you did flip out.
1367560	1372840	I took the scarf out and I started washing it, really scrubbing it down, thinking, I
1372840	1373840	could do this.
1373840	1375160	I could make this happen.
1375160	1382960	So I scrubbed it down and then I took it and I laid it out on Cody's heater to dry it.
1382960	1384960	Oh!
1384960	1386440	She was not happy.
1386440	1388240	Look, nothing smelled.
1388240	1389240	She washed it properly.
1389240	1390240	It was gone.
1390240	1391240	It was gone.
1391240	1392240	It was gone.
1392240	1394240	It was like a brand new scarf.
1394240	1395240	Yeah.
1395640	1397680	So I went to have lunch.
1397680	1398680	We...
1398680	1400800	He likes the story.
1400800	1401800	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1401800	1410040	So we came back and I said, Cody, the scarf that's on the dryer was full of shit.
1410040	1411680	But it's clean now.
1411680	1412680	She flipped out.
1412680	1416360	She goes, what do you mean you put it on my dryer, this shit scarf?
1416360	1417360	Yeah.
1417360	1418360	Right?
1418360	1419360	Because I have a little bit of a CD.
1419360	1420360	She's a little CD.
1420360	1421360	Germaphobic.
1421360	1422360	I'm a lot better.
1422360	1423360	I'm a lot better.
1423360	1424360	The best part.
1424480	1427280	So the best part is...
1427280	1429820	And I said, okay, now I got to go home to New York.
1429820	1431480	So I went back to New York.
1431480	1432480	To LA.
1432480	1433480	To LA.
1433480	1434480	Oh, I mean, sorry.
1434480	1435480	LA.
1435480	1437000	And the shit's gone to my friend.
1437000	1441660	So I went home and I kept the tissue paper and the bag from this store.
1441660	1445880	So I wrapped it up and I said, I'm going to fucking return this thing because I'm not
1445880	1448680	going to wear a scarf that has poop on it.
1448680	1449680	No.
1449680	1450680	No.
1450680	1453080	There's no way that I am going to put a poop...
1453080	1457360	I know that the poop is residue.
1457360	1463640	So I went to the store and I went up to the lady and I said, I'd like to return this
1463640	1464640	scarf.
1464640	1465640	You're a bad person.
1465640	1466640	Wait.
1466640	1467640	Wait.
1467640	1468640	Wait.
1468640	1469640	Put a pin in that.
1469640	1470640	Okay.
1470640	1471640	We're almost there.
1471640	1472640	And she said...
1472640	1475280	And she said to me, is there anything wrong with it?
1475280	1476280	And you said...
1476280	1478200	I said, no, no, no, no.
1478200	1479200	It's fine.
1479200	1481880	It's just that I bought it for my daughter.
1481880	1484200	And it's like 12 feet long.
1484200	1486000	And she's very short.
1486000	1491360	And every time she wears it, she steps on it and trips, so I'd like to return it.
1491360	1492360	That was the...
1492360	1493960	That wasn't the very good stuff.
1493960	1494960	God damn it.
1494960	1495960	That's not the first time.
1495960	1496960	That's how you say the first time.
1496960	1497960	Let me finish the story.
1497960	1498960	All right.
1498960	1502120	I'd like to return this scarf.
1502120	1503120	She said...
1503120	1504120	Ask me why.
1504120	1505120	What's wrong with it?
1505120	1507480	Well, it's too long and my daughter didn't like it.
1507480	1509440	That's how you said it to us.
1509440	1513840	Which is true, because it's so long that it went in the toilet and you took a shit
1513840	1518360	on it and your daughter didn't like it because it was coated in shit.
1518360	1520840	But you just leave certain details out and then you return it.
1520840	1521840	All right.
1521840	1525800	Is somebody in New York walking around wearing a poop scarf?
1525800	1526800	Probably.
1526800	1527800	No, I don't think any...
1527800	1531080	The reason that I didn't get that upset about it is because I was like, no one's ever gonna
1531080	1532080	buy this.
1532080	1536040	Like, that's the kind of store where it has like the clearance section and it will just
1536040	1537800	disappear into oblivion.
1537800	1540320	And so that's why I didn't admonish you.
1540320	1541320	I was like...
1541320	1544120	Ultimately, when I found out, I was like, all right.
1544120	1547400	It's a flawed thing a character would do, but it's still feeling his shit.
1547400	1554600	I have to say, Randy, that if you poop on a scarf, don't try to get the money back.
1554600	1556360	Do I get it?
1556360	1559320	I'm just supposed to exchange it for credit.
1559320	1565080	Fuck, I saved that one.
1565080	1572120	I want to segue into another guest that's like, I've been doing like a public television
1572120	1576440	thing where we're like linking things and that's why it's emotionally complicated.
1576440	1578320	Because you're my future mom-in-law.
1578320	1580800	You pooped on a scarf.
1580800	1583680	You were Mama LaRusso.
1583680	1587080	She was Rizzo in Greece on Broadway.
1587080	1589480	You were the original Rizzo, right?
1589480	1594360	There was one original Rizzo, but then, were you the original Rizzo or not?
1595160	1596160	You still love me?
1596160	1600920	Wait, no, but I mean, who played original Rizzo?
1600920	1601920	Adrienne Barbeau.
1601920	1602920	No.
1602920	1603920	Yeah.
1603920	1604920	Wait.
1604920	1605920	On Broadway, Adrienne Barbeau.
1605920	1606920	Oh, really?
1606920	1607920	Adrienne Barbeau?
1607920	1608920	Yeah, Adrienne Barbeau.
1608920	1609920	From Swamp Thing?
1609920	1610920	Huh?
1610920	1614080	I know her as Adrienne Barbeau from Swamp Thing.
1614080	1619760	She was an 80s, like, bazumbas, kind of 80s B movie kind of thing.
1619760	1620760	She was the original.
1620760	1625600	She was original Rizzo, but then you, like, did a huge run of Rizzo on Broadway.
1625600	1626600	You were basically...
1626600	1627600	Two years.
1627600	1628600	Yeah.
1628600	1631000	And so, our next guest was...
1631000	1632000	Johnny Angel.
1632000	1633000	Johnny Angel.
1633000	1634000	Does anybody...
1634000	1635000	Do you guys know Greece?
1635000	1636000	Teen Angel.
1636000	1637000	Why did you say Johnny Angel?
1637000	1638000	Teen Angel.
1638000	1641240	The Beauty School dropout, the song, like, the guy that comes and sings the Beauty School
1641240	1642240	dropout.
1642240	1643240	Right.
1643240	1647540	Anyways, I'll explain beyond that connection why we're bringing him up.
1647540	1649040	Please welcome Bob Garrett.
1650040	1651040	Bob Garrett!
1651040	1652040	Thank you.
1652040	1653040	Thank you for coming.
1653040	1663040	I'm very nervous because Randy gave me this scarf for my birthday.
1663040	1675040	Mom, you got to talk into the mic.
1675040	1676240	Okay, eat that mic.
1676240	1677240	Sorry.
1677240	1684440	We know each other from college and then we did Godspell together and then Greece together
1684440	1685440	on Broadway.
1685440	1688240	So, we go back a long, long, 50 years.
1688240	1690240	But he tells everybody I'm his nanny.
1690240	1691240	Correct.
1691240	1692240	So, yeah.
1692240	1693240	And a good one you were.
1693240	1694240	Oh, I was.
1694240	1695240	The best.
1695240	1698240	But, Bob, there's a linkage here.
1698240	1700880	I mean, look, I'm not a good podcast host.
1700880	1703440	I'm not a good podcast producer.
1703440	1705520	But things happen.
1705520	1713340	We follow our guts and our feelings and stuff and we recently lost a friend that we've talked
1713340	1717480	about many times on this podcast like kind of in the periphery like we've probably mentioned
1717480	1723720	his name a dozen or two dozen times in 300 and some episodes because he was so instrumental
1723720	1724720	to our lives.
1724720	1732560	This guy, Sam Christiansen, and he just recently passed a few weeks ago and it was like very
1732600	1739120	unexpected and I know weirdly Randy had a connection to him.
1739120	1744480	I mean, I know Sam knew you and Cody, but that was just like weird coincidence.
1744480	1749480	And I said, Randy, will you come on the show and now seems like a good time because maybe
1749480	1755640	you could tell some Sam stories and you're like, I don't know Sam well enough to eulogize
1755640	1760160	him but Bob, who you've met, was really close to him.
1760160	1765680	You saw him right before his passing and so I thought, Kismet, we need to eulogize
1765680	1771640	Sam Christiansen, someone that like he's not a household name, but if you've listened to
1771640	1778160	this podcast for hundreds of episodes, then Sam has like been caressing and touching you
1778160	1785160	the entire time because Jeff and I's origin stories go back and intertwine with Sam.
1786040	1793040	And so for those of us, let's kind of like now just like remember him and start with
1794720	1797800	how did you meet Sam, Bob?
1797800	1804240	Well, we were doing Godspell and Sam was the liaison between the actors and the producers.
1804240	1808160	He worked for the producers and he was so great.
1808160	1811760	And every time he'd come to the theater, he'd say, by the way, tonight, Paul Newman and
1811760	1815760	Joanne Woodward are here and they're not coming backstage because Paul doesn't come
1815760	1816880	backstage.
1816880	1821800	And then Paul Newman would walk into the theater in an all white suit in February.
1821800	1824520	But do you know who Paul Newman is?
1824520	1826920	I mean, they've heard of him.
1826920	1830320	He is salad dressing guy.
1830320	1831760	The salad dressing guy.
1831760	1836440	I started doing cabaret acts and I didn't want to ruin my reputation with the owners.
1836440	1841960	So I asked Sam to represent me and that turned into him becoming my full time manager.
1841960	1847480	And then we became best friends and then he ultimately got me to come out to Los Angeles
1847480	1852000	for meetings and manage me and became like my best friend.
1852000	1858560	And somewhere along there, I don't know what date that is, but what I know of Sam is that
1858560	1860240	he's working with actors in this capacity.
1860240	1863080	He was like he was an assistant to casting directors.
1863840	1869240	He worked on MASH in some capacity, like below the casting director, right?
1869240	1871040	Well, this is how brilliant he was.
1871040	1876080	He started out working as associate with the casting director and then he opened his own
1876080	1882200	agency and he came out here and one of the first things he cast was the movie Network.
1882200	1887360	And he started to say, when he got the script, you have to cast Faye Dunaway in this part.
1887360	1890720	And they said, oh, we can't afford Faye Dunaway and she'll never do it and we have a little
1890720	1892000	budget and everything.
1892000	1897720	So they brought in every B actress in Los Angeles to read for this part.
1897720	1898720	And they kept saying...
1898720	1899720	For network?
1899720	1900720	For network.
1900720	1901720	And we can't get anybody.
1901720	1902720	And why is nobody good?
1902720	1905680	And he said, Faye Dunaway, why won't you let me?
1905680	1906680	She'll never do it.
1906680	1907680	She'll never do it.
1907680	1908680	We can't afford it.
1908680	1910600	He said, just let me get the script to her.
1910600	1914000	I promise you, she'll pay you to do it.
1914000	1915400	And they sent the script turned.
1915400	1920240	She said, I don't care what it costs you, what I get, I want to do this film.
1920240	1922160	And then she won the Academy Award.
1922160	1926480	So then he opened his own agency and did mash and did all these things.
1926480	1929360	Sam totally demurred when I asked him about that.
1929360	1932600	He made it sound like he was just kind of an ancillary character in that story.
1932600	1935340	But I didn't know that he actually helped cast that movie.
1935340	1936340	He was the one.
1936340	1937800	He was the Faye Dunaway guy.
1937800	1938800	Wow.
1938800	1940960	That story makes perfect sense and it makes perfect sense that Sam never told it that
1940960	1941960	way.
1941960	1945320	I had heard about him being involved with that, but yeah, he downplayed it.
1945320	1949420	To give some context, if you don't know who we're talking about, Sam...
1949420	1953740	When I was 24 years old, I had a girlfriend who had taken his class and he does this kind
1953740	1959020	of essence like workshop where you find out essentially who you are.
1959020	1965940	And you get seven kind of statements to describe exactly why you are who you are, whether you
1965940	1967440	like it or not.
1967440	1974260	And my girlfriend at the time said, I was broke and she goes, find the money.
1974260	1975260	Take the class.
1975260	1976760	Don't ask any questions.
1976760	1982760	And I ended up doing it and it really was the reason I started working because you have
1982760	1984280	this self knowledge.
1984280	1988840	And then I told like Dan and Rob and everybody, and I told Drew Carey about it and Drew Carey
1988840	1994540	now still sent everybody to, it's like, you have to find out who you are.
1994540	1999240	And even if you think you know who you are, you don't have the permission to say out loud
1999240	2001200	what it is that makes you you.
2001200	2003480	And find out how people perceive you.
2003480	2010360	Because Sam's philosophy was when you're on a playground, you're starting to...
2010360	2012680	You're having this obsession with like, who am I?
2012680	2014360	How do people perceive me?
2014360	2019480	And the very things that make you unique, anything that makes you stand out, you're
2019480	2025360	tall, you're short, you're black, you have freckles, but more importantly, your personality,
2025360	2028960	you're sloppy, you're neat, you're...
2028960	2035720	You're practicing being exceptional and everyone else is practicing being everyone else.
2035720	2044680	And you go into your adulthood with these traumatic kind of like labels about the things
2044680	2050880	that people pointed out about you as you were developing, because whatever made you different
2050880	2058720	than everyone else, absolutely, this is not like society's job is to try to like, call
2058720	2061520	you out and go, you're sloppier than everyone else.
2061520	2067240	You're fatter, you're taller, you're weirder, you're slower, you're faster.
2067240	2071920	But when you're a kid and you're developing, you're like, okay, I need to fix that shit
2071920	2074560	or I'm in big trouble.
2074560	2079240	And it's right of you to like, want to fit in.
2079240	2085000	But then once you hit 18, 19, 20, it's time for you to drop that shit actually, like your
2085000	2090120	body's designed to drop that shit, but society's not designed to tell you when it's time to
2090120	2091120	let that go.
2091120	2094720	Because Sears and McDonald's are more than happy to step in and go, hey, you don't want
2094720	2099320	to be fucking weird, buy a Happy Meal, like no one's going to tell you to drop that shit.
2099320	2103880	Sam's class was telling you, okay, time to drop that shit.
2103880	2107120	What sparks your shame?
2107120	2109320	Go through his exercises.
2109320	2111960	Go through all your love letters from high school.
2111960	2115200	Go through your yearbook signings.
2115200	2120320	We've been getting called the same names since we were children into our adulthood.
2120320	2124760	And if somebody likes you and like, let's say like Dan, for instance, there's a way
2124760	2127380	to describe how Dan is smart.
2127380	2133860	If you like Dan, you say, oh, he's a genius, he's an intellect, like he's a mastermind.
2133860	2139820	If you don't like Dan, you go, oh, he's a genius and I hate him.
2139820	2148060	But being able to say in a couple words exactly how you're smart, Cody, and Bob, like what
2148060	2157180	makes you edgy or what makes you the neighborhood of how we would describe you as being witty,
2157180	2159740	but precisely say it.
2159760	2163400	And there's these words that we have all been called our whole lives.
2163400	2167600	Like Sam pointed out early on when I first met him and he said, Catherine Hepburn when
2167600	2174340	she was 18 or 19 when she did Philadelphia Story, every review called her Feisty.
2174340	2180000	When she was 80-something and she did On Golden Pond, everybody called her Krusty.
2180000	2186720	If you're Feisty at 18 and Krusty at 80, what the essence is is defiant.
2187720	2190280	You don't need men.
2190280	2197560	And that's what made her great was that all of her roles was I don't need you.
2197560	2200920	And if you're 18 or 80, it's a defiance.
2200920	2204140	We have different ways of saying what's special about you.
2204140	2208480	Their memories of what's said that's special about you on the playground are probably negative.
2208480	2212880	Then you have lovers throughout your life, they find the positive ways of saying it.
2212880	2219300	It doesn't really matter, and also crucially, it doesn't matter whether they're accurate.
2219300	2226200	Sam always used the example of Goldie Hawn, who is a very, very smart actor who...
2226200	2229640	She could debate your ass off on any topic, intellectual.
2229640	2236680	When she was young, the way the public wanted to perceive her, the way that she would get
2236680	2244160	gigs, it was like the people looked at her and said, you're an airhead, you're a bimbo,
2244160	2252000	you're a blonde idiot, whatever, there's probably healthier ways to say that, but that are equally
2252000	2257480	not acknowledging the truth about her intellect or her depth.
2257480	2262920	But if you're presenting yourself to the public and you're for public consumption, it's not
2262920	2267400	necessarily a bad thing if people don't know everything about you.
2267400	2272120	Right, because it's not the way you see you, but the way the world sees you.
2272120	2275120	And that's what you have to discover.
2275120	2278320	I always use the example of Louis Anderson, who would start his standup act and he would
2278320	2285560	do five or six fat jokes, and then he would pause and he'd wait in the laughter and subside
2285560	2290760	and he goes, I start my set with a bunch of fat jokes, because I know, it's like, oh,
2290760	2294920	that's so predictable, but also if I don't start my set that way, you guys are gonna
2294920	2299960	be out there for 45 minutes and some of you are gonna be like, do you think he knows?
2299960	2303920	And I always equated that with Sam's thing where I was like, charisma is Christopher
2303920	2310880	Walken knowing he's creepy, charisma is Jack Nicholson knowing he's dirty, charisma is
2310880	2317400	a fat person leaning into the, they're like, well, I'm not gonna try to convince you I'm
2317400	2323280	not fat, that has nothing to do with me endorsing body shaming or like, you know, thinking it's
2323280	2329640	better to be thin or whatever, it's just like, there's a weird energy you exude the day you
2329640	2337360	go, well, I'm kind of on the same page with how I am perceived at first glance.
2337360	2345720	And it kind of blows your mind, it's actually more likely that you're way off because of
2345720	2349160	the amount of refraction and then I just remember the exercises that we did.
2349160	2353080	Yeah, can you tell us about the airport thing, because that was the one that was really interesting.
2353080	2355840	Yeah, I've said it on the show before too, it's like, just sort of rushed through it,
2355840	2359000	but it was like, that was my big eye opener where I was like, okay, this guy's not full
2359000	2360000	of shit.
2360000	2363760	We went to the airport, it was pre-9-11, so you could just walk around the airport.
2363760	2368640	And we would do this exercise where we handed out forms and-
2368640	2373640	Yeah, it sounded like the worst idea, like, this sounds like a horrible homework assignment,
2373640	2375640	to go to the airport with somebody else in the class.
2375640	2379640	The international terminal are handed these forms and they go like, so your classmates
2379640	2383520	say, look at that guy, so that guy's me, I don't say a word, I'm just, I just lean
2383520	2384520	against a pillar.
2384520	2386640	It's like standing a hundred feet away over by a pillar and you go like-
2386640	2390280	And you have this sheet in front of you with 300 words on it and they don't give you a
2390280	2394200	limit, they don't ask you to engage, like, doing it right or wrong, and just circle
2394200	2397280	any word that you think applies to that guy over there, right there.
2397280	2400960	He's down with it, it's fine, you can stare at him, we're part of a psychology class,
2400960	2402680	we would say.
2402680	2406840	And so they'd sit there, circle, people from Poland, people from Memphis, people from Fort
2406840	2412560	Lauderdale, you're just in this LAX terminal, you do that for five hours, you leave LAX
2412560	2418080	with a giant stack of papers, you go home, you tabulate everything, and then I'm like,
2418080	2424720	why the fuck does everyone in the world think I'm sarcastic?
2424720	2426800	And lazy.
2426800	2427800	You're just standing there.
2427800	2432600	I went with a guy that looked like Charles Bronson, he was a weird dude, and we get in
2432600	2439240	the car, and we did like 50 of them, and he's going through, he's like, he's looking
2439240	2444320	from side to side, he's like, what the fuck, what, what, god damn it, what does everybody
2444320	2448040	think I'm suspicious?
2448040	2452600	And Shrob went into the weekend class with Shrob, you're not supposed to look at your
2452600	2456600	cards when you go to lunch, by the way, you were told.
2456600	2457600	What?
2457600	2458600	What did I-
2458600	2465040	Shrob looked at his cards, apparently, because we did the same class, we were there for hours,
2465040	2466040	and then you go to lunch-
2466040	2469680	This is classmates writing down things about you like a novice.
2469680	2472800	You take the class, and then your other classmates write shit down as you get these exercises,
2472800	2477680	and you go, okay, go to lunch, that was my impression of Sam, and Shrob and I were walking
2477680	2485160	down the sidewalk, and Shrob's like, what's wrong, he's like, nothing, what did you get
2485160	2486160	on your cards?
2486720	2489880	I didn't look at my cards, you're not supposed to look at your cards, and Shrob's like,
2489880	2494160	no, no, no, and I'm like, what, what, okay, obviously you looked at your cards, what's
2494160	2495160	your problem?
2495160	2501160	Rob goes, I am not C-3PO!
2501160	2511800	Waving his hands around, with his elbows locked at 90 degrees, as if, as if, first of all,
2511800	2518280	first of all, if I did that, I would be nothing like C-3PO, because he never did that.
2518280	2520000	Anthony Daniels, fucking-
2520000	2522320	No, no, you're embellishing to-
2522320	2527040	Okay, well that's how I remember it, because you're Tony C-3PO.
2527040	2534360	Sam, part of the class, which is amazing, is he gives you, you kind of find out mythologically
2534360	2539160	who you are, and what your myth is, where you live on Mount Olympus, and what the story
2539160	2544480	is that you tell, because all of our favorite, like, actor and actresses, they all kind of
2544480	2549080	portray the same role in different ways, but they're always kind of fulfilling a same kind
2549080	2556720	of myth, and I asked Sam, was it what's your myth, and he said, mine is to remove fear,
2556720	2561880	and if you could say anything great about Sam, and there's lots of great things to say,
2561880	2566360	Sam took fear away from people, and he gave you, like, freedom.
2566360	2570800	He created this environment where I was in my 20s, I was the worst version of me, and
2570800	2571800	that's me talking.
2571800	2574080	I'm already not a good person.
2574080	2579200	Imagine me at 25, where I'm, like, still cutting my teeth being a human being, and it's like,
2579200	2580800	but there was this space.
2580800	2585000	Anyways, I think what we wanted to do was, like, we could have, at any point, talked
2585000	2589480	about, oh, these are Sam's superpowers, this is why you should be interested in him.
2589560	2596520	I think, Bob, your contribution to it is, you were very close to him for his whole life,
2596520	2599960	and I asked you backstage, and it kind of caught me off guard.
2599960	2601760	It was like, when's the last time you saw him?
2601760	2607880	Because we saw him relatively recently, but you saw him two weeks ago.
2607880	2611920	Well, he'd come to my house every Friday night, and we'd watch Bill Maher, and we'd cook,
2611920	2615000	and one of the things, talk about taking away fear.
2615000	2617120	You know, I just got a soup maker, right?
2617120	2622200	So I said, I'm going to make soup for you in my new soup maker, which takes 18 minutes.
2622200	2628280	So I make this soup, and he said, he tastes it, and he says, yeah, yeah.
2628280	2629680	And I said, what do you mean, yeah?
2629680	2637080	He said, it's good, but what would make it great is if you added an entire lemon to this
2637080	2638120	soup.
2638120	2643080	So I squeezed the lemon into the soup, and he said, this is the best soup I've ever had.
2643960	2645840	He's pulling a little trick there.
2645840	2650520	He's like, I think I'll create a story where I knew exactly what needed to be in the soup.
2650520	2651520	Exactly.
2651520	2657800	So when you did Sam's class, the first part, when I did it back in the old days, you still
2657800	2660360	could go to the airport and do that thing.
2660360	2665880	Later it became more online and internet-based and faster.
2665880	2668680	You would do the class, you would get your essences, and then if you wanted to keep going,
2668680	2673400	you would do an acting class where you get a placard, and you would put it on a music
2673400	2677080	stand with your seven statements about who you were.
2677080	2682400	And it's kind of the neighborhoods of all the things people know about you on site,
2682400	2683960	but you don't know that people know that.
2683960	2688480	And it was just getting used to admitting that and knowing that people saw that stuff.
2688480	2691120	And then you would do a monologue.
2691120	2692120	So you could be anything.
2692120	2696200	It could be, I did something from network, or you could do something from Shakespeare,
2696200	2697720	whatever the hell.
2697720	2704960	And there was a guy in the class, it was a black guy, really good actor, and he did
2704960	2709040	this piece where it was like a really angry piece, I forget what it was, and he had a
2709040	2712280	ball cap on, and Sam goes, let's do it again.
2712280	2715200	I want you to turn your hat a little bit to the side.
2715200	2717440	And instantly the guy looked furious.
2717440	2722960	And he goes, just do it again, and turn your ball cap to the side.
2722960	2725680	And he did it, and it was the fucking best acting you've ever saw.
2725680	2728600	And when it was over, he instantly put his hat back straight.
2728600	2730720	And Sam goes, why does that make you so angry?
2730720	2734400	He goes, I don't want to be thought of as the guy that has the ball cap to the side.
2734400	2738400	And he goes, you see how close your anger is?
2738400	2743920	Like if you need it, all you have to do is be thought of or perceived as less than you
2743920	2744920	are.
2744920	2745920	Right.
2745920	2748840	Well, that's the thing, is like if people think that you, if you find out what your
2748840	2753980	essence is, that's equally empowering if you want to play the opposite of it or whatever.
2753980	2755820	Like being able to tap into your stuff.
2755820	2761260	One thing I'm curious about, Bob, now that he's gone, like you knowing Sam probably better
2761260	2770540	than us on stage, like how did Sam, like, did Sam have, like where was he at?
2770540	2775080	He was this kind of guru, he had this studio in Burbank.
2775080	2779620	My perception of him was always that he had plans to make it bigger.
2779620	2784340	He would do the internet version and he was like, he was trying to empire build, which
2784340	2789620	I totally relate to, which I have tried to do, like, oh, it's not enough that I'm just
2789620	2791300	going to do what I do.
2791300	2797420	Was Sam, was he frustrated about the business of being Sam or was he content with it?
2797420	2798740	No, he was content.
2798740	2804020	First of all, he did a lot of traveling to New York and Atlanta and all over the country.
2804020	2806420	And he'd go for weeks at a time.
2806660	2812300	That was very rewarding to him because he blossomed this business to reach so many people.
2812300	2818580	But it was a business of really having people center in on who they really are and how to
2818580	2823460	maneuver themselves through life in a successful way.
2823460	2826060	And that was incredibly rewarding to him.
2826060	2828580	It just seems like such a, that's good.
2828580	2833620	I'm glad that, because from my perspective, I always thought when I heard he passed, it
2833620	2837820	was like, oh, God, he never, he had just retired.
2837820	2841180	And he didn't, like, it was such a thankless job.
2841180	2844380	He just put up with a bunch of dipshits like me forever.
2844380	2849660	Like, we just kept gathering at his feet and he would go, all right, Dan, that's an interesting
2849660	2854340	choice in that Fight Club monologue.
2854340	2855340	What do you like about your mother?
2855340	2856340	My mother?
2856340	2857900	What does that have to do with Fight Club?
2857900	2858900	What color was your mother's hair?
2858900	2859900	I don't know.
2859900	2860900	Brown?
2860900	2861900	Go.
2861900	2863340	How's that working out for you?
2863340	2865780	Fight Club, do it better.
2865780	2868700	It just seemed like, by the way, I never chose the Fight Club monologue.
2868700	2869700	Fuck you if you did.
2869700	2871940	Can we find out your words, though?
2871940	2875020	I want to know your seven words.
2875020	2876420	I can't remember all seven.
2876420	2881540	Bob, did you actually, did you take Sam's kind of class where you got your essences?
2881540	2885980	I got my essences from living my life as his best friend.
2885980	2891100	But what was interesting to me is when I started out in Cabaret, he said to me at one point,
2891100	2892780	so who do you see yourself as?
2892780	2895860	And it was in the days of Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty.
2895860	2898460	And I said, well, I think I'm the Warren Beatty of song.
2898460	2899460	And he said, you're not.
2899460	2900460	You're not.
2900460	2902460	You're the Fade Dunaway of song.
2902460	2905100	You're more the Fade Dunaway.
2905100	2909740	So he said, so here's the thing.
2909740	2912100	He said, you're in God's spell.
2912100	2914500	You get laughs every night.
2914500	2920660	Now what you have to do is start talking between numbers in this act and be who you are.
2921220	2926980	With your humor, instead of just singing one song to the next song to the next song.
2926980	2928980	Which helped me discover who I was.
2928980	2934040	And then once I was authentically me, I was able to attract people in record companies
2934040	2938380	to be interested in me because I wasn't trying to be Warren Beatty anymore.
2938380	2942060	Even though in my mind, I was secretly wishing I could be.
2942060	2944900	We all have that person that we target.
2944900	2947140	We think like, oh, I wish I was like them.
2947140	2951660	And the curious thing is that you might, by virtue of some random experience, you might
2951660	2955100	actually find yourself being someone else's thing.
2955100	2959580	And what a crime it is that that person's looking at someone who's thinking, I wish
2959580	2962660	I was Bill Murray.
2962660	2964820	That person doesn't wish that you were Bill Murray.
2964820	2970580	That person may or may not know who Bill Murray is, but I always wonder where you're supposed
2970580	2972300	to draw those lines.
2972300	2977980	We have these mentors, these figures, oh, I had an epiphany while I was watching this
2977980	2980180	person do stand up or perform.
2980180	2981860	I wish I was Gary Shandling.
2981860	2985780	I wish I was David Foster Wallace.
2985780	2986780	I wish I was this.
2986780	2987780	I wish I was that.
2987780	2990700	Like, what are you supposed to construct your identity out of if it's not other primates
2990700	2994180	around you who have done things that you've admired?
2994180	2998180	And yet, somewhere within there, you're supposed to just be yourself.
2998180	3000980	And it's the most useless advice in the world.
3000980	3004740	But Sam somehow was able to get into that yoke.
3004740	3009940	I remember like half of your essence is Dan and probably like a few of yours, Rob.
3009940	3015500	But like when I took it first and then you start telling everybody, go take this class,
3015500	3021020	whether you're an actor or not, like it's really valuable no matter what you do.
3021020	3022020	Like that self-knowledge thing.
3022020	3024180	And it sounds culty to talk about this.
3024180	3032500	It really was this is beautiful that there's no way to express how much Sam means to people.
3032500	3034260	It was super culty.
3034260	3039900	When Rob took it, like when I got my essence, Sam tells me, he's like, there's going to
3039900	3044020	be one essence that's going to be kind of an epiphany for you that you're going to go,
3044020	3046340	oh, that's how I say that.
3046340	3053340	And he told me, like we were trying to talk about the neighborhood of my poise or my confidence.
3053380	3054900	And if you don't like me, I'm arrogant.
3054900	3056340	If you like me, I'm poised.
3056340	3058340	If you like, there's that thing.
3058340	3062100	And he wrote down a thing and he put it on a piece of paper and slid it across the desk.
3062100	3066060	He goes, anybody else would hate this, but I think you're going to like it.
3066060	3071740	And it was the neighborhood of my confidence or cockiness or whatever.
3071740	3076540	And it was not conceited, just convinced.
3076540	3078780	And I hit the fucking desk and go, exactly.
3078780	3081220	I said, I don't think I'm better than you.
3081220	3082980	I know I'm better than you.
3082980	3085540	I almost started crying.
3085540	3092540	The one that Rob had, my favorite one for you, Rob, Last Puppy at the Pound.
3096180	3099380	That's not the one, I see that one, I don't, I love that one.
3099380	3103260	Rob's that I remember is Waiting for Permission.
3103260	3107260	Also my favorite, my other favorite is Little Green Man.
3107260	3109700	Like you're from outer space.
3109700	3112940	And then the next year you dressed up as Little Green Man for Halloween, and it was
3112940	3115460	the best outfit of all time.
3115460	3119540	What about Fuck the Dog But Won't Admit It?
3119540	3120940	He got you on that one.
3120940	3122940	You're doing this again.
3122940	3123940	I love that.
3123940	3124940	Yeah, you're doing this.
3124940	3125940	This is what you're doing.
3125940	3132580	Some of Harmon's, the overriding one for me is, and it sounds weird, but it is perfect.
3132580	3137660	It's Mud Monster on Shore Leave.
3137660	3139820	That's the one that I like.
3139820	3143180	Well Sam would say some of these are your own.
3143180	3146860	It doesn't need to make sense to other people, it's for you to recalibrate.
3146860	3151560	And actually I've forgot, I refer to the last year being rough for me, and it's precisely
3151560	3154580	because I forgot.
3154580	3157660	It's like, oh god, you're a Mud Monster on Shore Leave.
3157660	3164660	Which to me means your story doesn't get to be about, all right, well whatever.
3165660	3172660	Sam, like, also, other ones of Dan's, Unspeakable Sadness, came alone and leaving likewise.
3174940	3177940	I love that one.
3177940	3181580	Yeah, they were rough.
3181580	3186580	But you don't get the essences you want, you get the ones you need.
3186580	3188420	Can I ask you a question?
3188420	3193140	Some of these are so poetic, you're saying there was a list of 300 that people would
3193140	3194620	circle, so these were written by-
3195580	3200260	Sam, back in the day, you would get there, you would collate all this information, and
3200260	3204260	you would find out, okay, everybody's calling you sarcastic, or sardonic, witty, funny.
3204260	3206220	I know, but Mud Monster on Shore Leave.
3206220	3208220	But Sam would just write it down.
3208220	3212500	He would make these pitches, he'd slide them across the table.
3212500	3215580	Look at that, and I'd go, oh.
3215580	3219540	The evolution of that was the Mud Monsters always welcome at the ball, or something like
3219540	3220540	that.
3220540	3227500	And I was like, yeah, but I don't, yeah, I suppose he is, but I don't give a fuck.
3227500	3231940	I brought a monologue in for the acting class after that, a whole process, and it was like
3231940	3237780	this tough guy asshole, like a mean, angry monologue.
3237780	3241060	And I was trying to be a tough guy, and he goes, okay, Jeff, that was good, let's do
3241060	3241740	it again.
3241740	3248540	And you have your card, your placard with all your essences on it, which is kind of,
3248540	3252900	you feel very exposed, because you're proud of some, embarrassed by others, but they're
3252900	3254140	there.
3254140	3260380	And he goes, Jeff, why is, because one of my essences was dashing, pardon, dashing.
3260380	3262700	It gets you choked up how dashing you are.
3262700	3266460	See, isn't that dashing him?
3266460	3268140	And he goes, Jeff, why is dashing on that?
3268140	3269140	I go, I don't like that one.
3269140	3272740	That's why, because someone that's dashing wouldn't say they're dashing.
3272740	3274700	And he goes, do it again.
3274700	3279980	And I did it as dashing, and it was way scarier.
3279980	3282340	Like if you just own anything.
3282340	3287380	He told one guy, he goes, do it again, but sit on your hands.
3287380	3290180	He goes, you can't use your hands, now do it.
3290180	3293100	And it was the most terrifying thing in the world.
3293100	3298060	He just had this way to bring out something by the turn of your hat, or a little thing.
3298060	3303900	Or if it was Randy, and you go, do it, see the way you're tilting your head?
3303900	3308220	Why do you do that?
3308220	3309220	Now start.
3309220	3315420	And then it brings out the stuff.
3315420	3321060	Your tears, people that think they can't cry on camera, or can't cry on command, like in
3321060	3327580	a play, or a TV show, or a film, it's so close to the surface, all you have to do is slightly
3327580	3333300	scratch the surface, and just say, why are you listening like that?
3333300	3334900	I always do.
3334900	3337180	And there's tears that come from that.
3337180	3345060	And he had this ability to absolutely draw humanity out of yourself that you think shouldn't
3345060	3347860	be there, couldn't be there.
3347860	3351020	You're not allowed to possess it, or it's too far away to own.
3351020	3355580	Like he just had this ability.
3355580	3357860	I mean, I'll fucking start crying.
3357860	3373620	Bob, what do you think, like, okay, we've lost Sam, nobody gets to go, oh, I'm scheduled
3373620	3380460	to leave a month from now, here's what I got to say, goodbye, I'm packing my things.
3380460	3387340	It sounds like he left kind of weirdly peacefully, relatively young man to, as you described it,
3387340	3393780	he said he was at the home of his partner, and he just said, I feel faint, and he laid
3393780	3397620	his head down on the table, and he was gone.
3397620	3400700	But how old was he again?
3400700	3401700	70.
3401700	3402700	70.
3402700	3410260	Which, I hope is the new 50, for my sake, I always thought, I felt like Sam was 60 when
3410260	3416780	I was 25, and he looked 60 the last time I saw him a couple of months ago, he was, anyways,
3416780	3425280	but he, for a guy that, he was always like, he took other people's fear away, he was interested
3425280	3431820	in them, no matter how much of a schmendrick they were, he was so non-judgmental, or at
3431820	3438980	least he just gave everybody a chance to figure out who the fuck they were.
3438980	3444500	Now that he's gone, do you feel a door closing where you're like, oh shit, what did Sam want
3444500	3445500	from me?
3445500	3447260	Does that make sense?
3447260	3452540	Is there something that you worry about personally that you're like, oh shit, if Sam had known
3452540	3458900	he was gonna take off, and I had had a chance to say to him, hey, not to be even more selfish
3458900	3466780	than I was our entire relationship, but any final thoughts, because that he might have
3466780	3469580	given you some advice, or given you a-
3469580	3474420	I don't feel that there were things that were unfinished between us, because we were always
3474420	3479500	vocal about how important we were to each other in our lives.
3479500	3485540	He was about to start a new chapter, because he had bought a house in Asheville.
3485540	3486540	So-
3486540	3487540	North Carolina.
3487540	3488540	In North Carolina.
3488540	3489540	Nailed it.
3489540	3495220	So, so there was a part of him that was beginning this new chapter, and I don't know whether
3495220	3499540	that had anything to do with his passing, that it was the end of one chapter in the
3499540	3501420	beginning of another.
3501420	3503580	But I know how rewarded he was.
3503580	3508500	I don't- I wish I could have said goodbye to him, but I don't feel like there was anything
3508500	3510540	unfinished between us.
3510540	3516060	We were always very vocal about each other, each other's lives, what was ahead of us as
3516060	3518500	far as projects, and dreams, and-
3518500	3522500	You guys got together, and you watched Bill Maher, and Sam was always very- he made no
3522500	3527900	secrets about his politics, and yet his politics were sort of like- he wasn't like- to me,
3527900	3531420	he wasn't like a militant liberal, like, oh my god, we have to do something, but at
3531420	3535420	the same time, he was absolutely unapologetic about-
3535420	3536420	An incredibly well-versed-
3536420	3538940	This world is fucked up, the situation is fucked up.
3538940	3544380	So he's watching Bill Maher, he's obviously- he's able to put up with Bill Maher's personality.
3544380	3548580	That means that you guys sat week after week, and you talked about his view of the world.
3548580	3549580	We did.
3549580	3555820	And so, I guess that's the related question is, did- I don't want to be as corny as to
3555820	3560580	say, if Sam were here right now, what would he say to us, knowing that he gets one last
3560580	3564740	thing to say to us, but I guess that's- I don't know, something in that area, like,
3564740	3568020	Sam had an opinion about the world, and the way it was going, and stuff.
3568020	3574380	Like, I- would he give a- like, we were like, hey Sam, what should we remember to do now
3574380	3579940	that you're gone, and you're never gonna remember- remind us to do it again, like, I put that
3579940	3580940	upon you.
3580940	3581940	It's a really dumb, bad podcast.
3582620	3587620	One of the things that he wanted was for Trump and Pence to both be taken down and have Nancy
3587620	3588620	Pelosi be president.
3588620	3589620	Oh, okay.
3589620	3590620	That's simple enough.
3590620	3592620	We can get to the nuts and bolts of that.
3592620	3596620	You know, he just felt like, let somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing be in
3596620	3597620	there.
3597620	3600140	It'd be funny, because he's like, Santa Claus, like, Santa, what do you want from the world?
3600140	3602380	I want Nancy Pelosi to be president.
3602380	3609740	No, make no mistake, I've got really specific- oh, I need the 23rd District to flip, and-
3609740	3618820	And he was predicting everything, like he said, I think what's gonna happen is that
3618820	3625060	they're gonna bring down Donald Trump Jr. and Jared, and go to Trump and say, listen,
3625060	3628620	this is what we're gonna do, you better resign, or this is gonna happen.
3628620	3632540	I have that prediction too, as of the Roger Stone indictment too, that it actually comes
3632540	3636060	down to Donald Jr., that it's not gonna touch Trump at all.
3636060	3640860	I don't think that it's gonna- I have that premonition, I've been reading the experts
3640860	3647540	kind of speculation about this, I believe it actually- I do actually believe, as controversial
3647540	3652340	as this may seem, that Donald Trump had no capacity to actually do anything but blunder
3652340	3656940	his way into accidental treason.
3656940	3662060	He never was like, I get a great idea about how to be Dr. No.
3662060	3666900	I think he totally thought he was just like, I'm winning, I know how to win.
3666900	3678740	And I think his son, who is half as smart somehow, went way too far, and took meetings
3678740	3684740	and left a paper trail, and it's gonna come to him- happy birthday, Sam, we're talking
3684740	3694420	about this, but I don't see it coming to- that's the weird telenovela that I don't-
3694420	3695420	how is that gonna work?
3695420	3699220	They're gonna go, hey, we're locking your son away, and then he's gonna go, that's
3699220	3704900	all right, I'm gonna pardon him, and everyone's gonna go, yay!
3704900	3709940	Pardon him later, so long son, I'm proud of you.
3709940	3710940	How does the pardoning work?
3710940	3714380	You can't do it until later, right?
3714380	3720300	People are gonna watch him- watch his son go to prison.
3720300	3727260	That's my prediction, and it's gonna- it's gonna finally find the funny bone of this
3727260	3732940	dead corpse of an empire, like, everyone's gonna go- that's fucking weird.
3732940	3738900	What do you think, uh- You're just watching your son go to prison, like, no wall, no Mexican
3738900	3743780	is that important, but I can't fucking, like, believe what you're doing.
3743780	3755260	What do you think, Sam, would- essences for Trump would be?
3755260	3756260	What are Trump's essences?
3756260	3761420	Like, I- I searched out on the top, like, like, well, it would just be like, like, like, like,
3761420	3765780	he kind of- he kind of spouts them out, I mean, I think, like, like, like, if you were-
3765780	3771460	you could be a fan of his by going, like, yeah, he said- he- he would be- his essences
3771460	3777260	would be like, I'm big, very big, or like, it would be like, like, toy truck language,
3777260	3783500	like, like, my truck big, and it would be exactly why, when you love him, you love him,
3783500	3790620	if you love him, it'd be like, my truck big, like, I- I get more candy, like, I deserve
3790620	3791620	all the candy.
3791620	3792620	Or- or hemorrhoidal.
3792620	3793620	Hemorrhoidal.
3793620	3799140	I mean, a little bit- with a little touch out of seven essences, like, two of them would
3799140	3803860	be like, they would evoke pain, like, like, like, like, how come Obama made me hooked
3803860	3807780	on opiates or something, like, you're gonna have this kind of, like, thumbs sucky, like,
3807780	3810900	why is everybody picking on me, like, just a hint of that.
3810900	3818260	But most of it would be like, like, like, me- me no share me candy, like, and- and it would
3818260	3823660	be like, like, yeah, that's- it's about time someone said that, because if- because I'm
3823660	3824660	a fucking idiot.
3824660	3825660	Okay, now- now do me.
3825660	3828860	Like, I'm not doing- that wasn't a Trump, uh, no, I'm saying-
3828860	3842380	Your essences, as far as I can tell, are, uh, I love handsome people, uh, I- I'm sorry
3842380	3848680	who are listening to this podcast, uh, on my phone, I will continue to hit snooze every
3848680	3857300	ten minutes, so that you'll never find out what the sentence was, because you just, uh-
3857300	3858300	You burned me.
3858300	3859300	Damn.
3859300	3860300	That's good.
3860300	3863380	That's like, we're listening to the podcast, and it's like, like, come on, it was nine
3863380	3864380	snoozes ago.
3864380	3865380	Get out!
3865380	3868820	No, I only did it twice this morning, come on, you're being-
3868820	3871980	I'm projecting a lot of shame about my snoozing.
3871980	3878140	Um, I don't- no, don't put me on the spot, sorry.
3878140	3881220	Alright, what were- what were your other ones from?
3881220	3883940	I don't remember the other- those are the only three I remember.
3883940	3884940	Really?
3884940	3886340	Yeah, I don't remember them.
3886580	3887580	I always forget-
3887580	3890340	But the first- those top three were, I mean, well-
3890340	3891340	Last puppy at the pound.
3891340	3892340	Last puppy at the pound is-
3892340	3893340	Little Green Man.
3893340	3894340	Yeah.
3894340	3895340	Those two were the big ones.
3895340	3901100	What do you think, Sam, think- like, well, Sam's here, Sam's watching, Sam now, then
3901100	3904980	he goes away after the show, as far as this being on stage, like, what do you- can you
3904980	3910540	think of anything Sam would like to see us do as an exercise or anything to show him?
3910540	3915180	I think you'd like us all to have nipple rings, so you can see through his t-shirt.
3915180	3919500	He looked like Santa Claus, but then if he- he would wear it, he was, like, fucking ripped,
3919500	3923340	like, like, in this, like, bare daddy way, like, he had a big barrel chest.
3923340	3925340	That is so hot, I think you should get nipple rings.
3925340	3926340	And-
3926340	3927340	Oh my god, I can see this.
3927340	3931540	And he would wear, like, polo shirts, and he had this, like, kind of painted on, beautiful
3931540	3932540	white beard.
3932540	3933540	Razor sharp hair.
3933540	3937260	And then he'd be like, I want to tell you how you need to activate yourself, and why
3937260	3940220	you need to be honest with yourself, and then you'd, like, if you squinted, you'd be like,
3940220	3942340	this guy's got two pierced nipples.
3943340	3946420	Underneath, underneath his incredibly tasteful polo.
3946420	3948180	Rock on, baby.
3948180	3950820	What year was your birthday that we roasted you and Sam was there?
3950820	3951820	30th birthday.
3951820	3952820	30th.
3952820	3955940	For Dan's 30th birthday, we have it, I think we have it on video somewhere, right?
3955940	3956940	Oh, that'd be great.
3956940	3958340	I can't wait for that to surface.
3958340	3959340	Yeah.
3959340	3960340	I can't wait.
3960340	3962740	Can I do more than quit Twitter?
3962740	3966940	By the way, I quit Twitter, and then they fucking- all right.
3966940	3967940	We roasted Dan, and-
3967940	3968940	It's a timeline.
3969740	3978940	When Sam was dating Ken Cortland, who's the best also, and one of Ken's essences was predatory.
3978940	3979940	Yeah.
3979940	3980940	He-
3980940	3986980	And when he said it, he goes, I'm predatory, and he's like, oh shit, I'm in danger right
3986980	3987980	now.
3987980	3993020	I roasted Sam, and one of my jokes was, what are yours?
3993020	3994900	Sam gave me my start.
3994900	4002140	Sam is so old that, you know, he gave me my start, this is your joke, and it's nice
4002140	4007340	to think that he- the guy that gave me my start also invented fire.
4007340	4012700	No, but- all right.
4012700	4016340	I think it's- I don't know if it was like things feel like Sam kind of in a certain
4016340	4020780	sense he discovered me, which is very flattering because he also discovered fire.
4021780	4028020	It was a roast joke and it wasn't worth the feeding, but to fuck it up like that is- and
4028020	4033580	that poop scarf story, I mean, you went out of your way, like you- truthfully, the way
4033580	4038260	I heard the story, you were a hero, you made yourself a villain, it was so- because it
4038260	4039260	was like-
4039260	4042660	I think it's because she was like self-aware, binging about how the story went on and off,
4042660	4043660	and so-
4043660	4047220	I looked at the scarf and I was like, hey, why the fuck did I ever have to take any shit?
4047220	4052820	I'm gonna take this shit and fucking pawn it off on him.
4052820	4056580	When I heard the story over brunch, I was like, holy shit, it was just like- went through-
4056580	4061380	she took- you took a shit on the scarf, and then you took it back?
4061380	4064180	I'm sorry, I'm not giving you notes.
4064180	4065180	I-
4065180	4066180	No, you are.
4066180	4067180	No, I'm bad, I'm bad.
4067180	4068180	I'm shy, I'm shy.
4068180	4076460	No, mom, you're doing a great job, you're doing a great job.
4076460	4078100	Thank you for- I'm so happy to-
4078100	4081740	Give it up for Randy Heller, everybody, come on.
4081740	4083740	Mama in the house.
4083740	4090300	I have a good story to share about Randy, actually, that I think it will make up for
4090300	4091300	any character-
4091300	4092460	Does Sam drive through it?
4092460	4095700	I feel like he would, because I feel like one of my words is that.
4095700	4096700	Alright.
4096700	4101420	Okay, so one of the words I would say that I am is the game that my mom used to play
4101420	4104140	with me, which is called Wild Fish.
4104140	4109740	And basically, I would spend a lot of time in the bathtub, which, side note, it was because
4109740	4115420	I- we had a jacuzzi tub, and I had just discovered masturbating because you could, you know, sit
4115420	4119700	up on the thing, and I had this book called Where Did I Come From, which was an illustrated
4119700	4125300	book explaining sex to kids, which happened to- I mean, it was hot.
4125300	4128380	It was like, you could- you could spend time on it.
4128380	4130500	So it was like, page one- where did I come from?
4130500	4132580	Page two- oh, pussy.
4132580	4135060	Page three, and you've got one.
4135060	4136060	Page four.
4136060	4137060	Check it out.
4137060	4138060	No, no, no, no.
4138060	4139060	No, no, no, no.
4139060	4145460	It's a romantic- it's a romantic tale about a mom and a dad, and they're like kind of
4145460	4150060	a heavyset couple, like they're just like a normal- like the dad is balding.
4150060	4151580	It's a very realistic portrayal of just-
4151580	4153260	This is how I hit the jackpot.
4153260	4156020	You do look a lot like the dad in Where Did I Come From?
4156020	4158340	I don't know whether to feel good or bad about this, like I just man-
4158340	4159340	No, he's hot.
4159340	4161340	No, he's hot, he's hot, he's hot.
4161940	4166980	It explained, you know, when a mom and a dad or a man and a woman meet and are in love,
4166980	4171880	I mean, this was before- you had, you know, this was just heteronormative, like 80s stuff,
4171880	4173420	but it was still pretty hot.
4173420	4176820	But they're like, mom and a dad, they want to get so close to each other because they
4176820	4181580	love each other so much, so like when they hug each other, the penis of the dad goes
4181580	4187060	inside of the vagina of the mom, and then when it feels really good, it's like- it feels
4187060	4190780	like a big buildup and then a release, like a sneeze.
4191500	4193980	This is just a side note, by the way, about the wild fish story.
4193980	4196060	Sorry, this had nothing to do with wild fish.
4196060	4201940	But as a weird thing, because I read that and absorbed it into my brain, now when I
4201940	4206820	get turned on, sometimes I sneeze, and it's because in my brain it got programmed in weird
4206820	4207820	from that book.
4207820	4213580	But anyway, so I love taking these baths, and then my mom would be like- and the wild
4213580	4217580	fish existed before I was like aware of my sexuality, but anyway-
4217580	4221220	Let me bookend this, and I promise it'll be helpful, because our couple's therapist
4221220	4224300	was like, hey, let me just ask you guys something.
4224300	4229100	Me and Cody's just like, why don't you guys describe the- what was it like- did you guys
4229100	4231660	take baths when you were a kid?
4231660	4232660	What was that like?
4232660	4236260	And then Cody- go ahead, now explain what happened when you took baths.
4236260	4240380	I love taking baths, and even before the book and all that, I just love being in the bath
4240380	4244060	and pretending, you know, just playing and going on in the bath forever, so to get me
4244060	4247740	to lure me out of the bath, my mom would be like, okay, we're going to time to play
4247740	4254220	wild fish, and she would get out the big duvet cover from the bed, the whole thing, the comforter
4254220	4257340	from the bed, and she would- I would get out of the bath, she would wrap me in a towel,
4257340	4261540	and like two towels, one on my head, one on my body, and then she would wrap me up in
4261540	4267140	the comforter, in like a big dumpling, she would like wrap all of me up in there, and
4267140	4272660	she would drag me around the house, like in this thing, over the Harvard floors, and she
4272660	4277980	would do the voices of like basically the premise was that I was a wild fish, she was
4277980	4283140	an activist who like was saving me from the zoo, we were like going through the zoo, and
4283140	4287220	she would do the different voices like a security guard would come and be like, ma'am, I'm going
4287220	4291300	to have to see what's in the bag there, and she'd be like, oh, nothing officer, this is
4291300	4296740	no, this is not, it's certainly not a wild fish, no, and then she would like- and it
4296740	4302020	was the most fun ever, and yeah, it makes me want to have a kid to play wild fish with
4302020	4304180	them, it was really magical.
4304180	4325980	And Dan, and I would go, I remember the water getting very cold, and eventually going, hello!
4325980	4331380	My brother and I, we were real little, we would take baths together, and we had a game
4331380	4338100	called Peepy Monster, and somebody would pee in the bathtub, but you had to stand up
4338100	4345220	on the edge of the bathtub, and try to knock the other brother into the pee, because the
4345220	4346820	pee was a monster.
4346820	4352740	Because, and also because pee, the pee, like you're saying like, oh, once the pee was in
4352740	4354700	the tub, like you got up on the ledge?
4354700	4357740	Yeah, you're skirting the edges of it.
4357740	4360940	Why did you have to avoid it, because it was a monster?
4360940	4363700	It's already pee.
4363700	4365740	Why was the game called Peepy Monster?
4365740	4371220	You could have said, stop at the first pee, fuck, I peed in the tub, I don't want to touch
4371220	4372220	it!
4372220	4374220	But is it a monster?
4374220	4379900	I mean, I really don't want to touch it, it's piss, you peed in a pool!
4379900	4387500	What the fuck, gross, really gross, really gross, congratulations!
4387500	4394980	You and your brother, gross, just gross.
4394980	4399980	I once took a shit in the tub, remember when Sloane was in there with me, and she freaked
4399980	4400980	out?
4400980	4403740	My sister, we were taking a bath together, and I, I mean, I was young, I think it was
4403740	4404740	a shark.
4404740	4407340	I mean, I don't remember, but she freaked out, right?
4407340	4416700	She was like, yeah, she wasn't, she's like, I'm done now, she's 13, I'm done.
4416700	4418660	She saved my life, you know.
4418660	4419660	Tell it.
4419660	4420660	Okay.
4420660	4421740	Sounds like content.
4421740	4426660	We were, we were walking, and Sam was hysterical at this story, everybody is, I hope.
4426660	4433940	So we were walking out of a grocery store, and this car comes zooming through the parking
4433940	4440900	lot, and Randy pulled me back, and she started screaming at this woman in the car, she said,
4440900	4441900	what's wrong with you?
4441900	4443800	You almost killed my friend!
4443800	4450360	And in the car was this very heavyset African-American woman with nine children, and she looked
4450360	4453960	at us, and she goes, didn't you see me not looking?
4453960	4454960	All right.
4454960	4462520	I'm going to get some emails about that one.
4462520	4465320	Thank God we don't check our emails.
4465320	4468520	Damn Reddit, I have an issue with H-tells.
4468520	4469520	H-tells.
4469520	4473720	That reminded me briefly, and you can say, no, I don't want to tell that story.
4473720	4481600	There was a story about Bruce Willis slapping you, like, okay.
4481600	4482600	That's the whole story, really.
4482600	4483600	That's the whole story?
4483600	4488600	Right, well, but no, but it wasn't, it was like he was leaning in the car on Sunset Boulevard
4488600	4490480	or whatever, and he's like, hey, what's going on?
4490480	4491480	Where's the party?
4491480	4495080	And you're like, it was like the 80s, and you were like, I don't know Bruce Willis,
4495080	4496080	what are you?
4496080	4497080	And then he like.
4498080	4500600	What did he do that for?
4500600	4501600	Talk into the microphone.
4501600	4503600	He was very high.
4503600	4510200	All right, well, let's call that the gossip section so that nobody, like, I just, I forgot
4510200	4511200	the world we're living in.
4511200	4514280	I thought, like, Bruce Willis called out for slapping.
4514280	4515280	Was it?
4515280	4516280	Okay, back up.
4516280	4517280	I can't figure it out.
4517280	4524040	So was it like a Pulp Fiction Ving Raim situation where your Bruce Willis and Bruce Willis's
4524040	4525040	Ving Raims?
4525360	4529640	You stop and Bruce Willis sticks his head in the car and just say, hey, you know, welcome
4529640	4530640	to California.
4532640	4533640	I'm Bruce Willis.
4533640	4534640	You're like, I know who you are.
4534640	4541480	And then he just slapped you and went, check it out, watch moonlighting, get the fuck out
4541480	4542480	of there.
4542480	4543480	What did you think of that?
4543480	4545320	He gave you a bitch slap.
4545320	4549240	And you were like, okay, well, that just happened.
4549240	4553640	Or were you like, like, like, was it, it was, did it bum you out?
4553640	4554640	Like you were.
4554640	4555640	I was just shocked.
4555640	4556640	What did I do?
4556640	4559240	I was just sitting there.
4559240	4561800	What was his, why did he slap you?
4561800	4562800	What precipitated that?
4562800	4563800	And nothing at all?
4563800	4565560	Or just, he's just being Bruce Willis.
4565560	4566560	I don't know.
4566560	4569560	It's something to do with me returning a poop scarf or something.
4569560	4570560	I don't know.
4570560	4571560	I don't know.
4571560	4572560	Yeah.
4572560	4573560	He was coming on to me.
4573560	4574560	It was a playful.
4574560	4577520	He was, what the kids call it, he was nagging you.
4577520	4578520	He was nagging you.
4578520	4583240	Like, it was like, oh, if I, you know, what's he selling?
4583240	4584240	I was married.
4584840	4591600	And I went, if you weren't married, would you have, if I, what, if you were not married,
4591600	4595280	would you have, you know, probably, I don't know.
4595280	4596280	I don't know.
4596280	4597280	I don't know.
4597280	4598880	That's such a random thing for my past.
4598880	4599880	Yeah.
4599880	4600880	I don't know.
4600880	4601880	I do.
4601880	4605120	I, I, if I wasn't married, I would, I would fuck Bruce Willis.
4605120	4607120	Oh, look, he's here.
4607120	4608120	He's here.
4608120	4609120	He's here.
4609120	4610120	He's here.
4610120	4611120	Whoa.
4611120	4612120	Oh, he's slapping everybody.
4613120	4614120	Oh, he's slapping everybody.
4614120	4615120	Hey, Bruce, wait.
4615120	4616120	What are you doing?
4616120	4617120	Bruce, wait.
4617120	4618120	Come on.
4618120	4619120	Shake it easy.
4619120	4620120	Bruce.
4620120	4621120	It's a new segment.
4621120	4622120	What are you doing, Bruce?
4622120	4623120	Okay.
4623120	4624120	Go for it.
4624120	4625120	No, be Bruce.
4625120	4626120	Be Bruce.
4626120	4627120	That's all I got.
4627120	4628120	And then he went to the next car.
4628120	4630120	I was trying to build it out into a thing where you're like a Daniel Tiger and Mr.
4630120	4631120	Rogers or something.
4631120	4633120	Bruce, what time is it?
4633120	4634120	Let's reenact.
4634120	4635120	Let's reenact the scenario.
4635120	4637120	So, so Randy, you're, you're driving your car.
4637120	4638120	Bruce Willis comes up.
4638120	4639120	I was in the passenger seat.
4639120	4640120	We pulled up to in front of.
4640120	4641120	Wait.
4642120	4643120	I'm so bad about it.
4643120	4645120	Second of all, vocalize what you're doing.
4645120	4646120	Like, like.
4646120	4647120	I wasn't driving.
4647120	4650120	Like, I don't mean to feed you lines, but like, you'd be like, Hey, it's me.
4650120	4651120	Mama LaRusso.
4651120	4653120	I'm Hollywood Boulevard.
4653120	4655120	I'm not even sure if I had done that already.
4655120	4656120	I don't think I did.
4656120	4658120	This is pre-LaRusso.
4658120	4659120	Fix it.
4659120	4660120	Re-write it.
4660120	4661120	No, we just pulled up.
4661120	4663120	My friend and I, too, in the improv is Karen Brooks.
4663120	4665120	You know what I'm going to say.
4665120	4667120	You were going to the improv to see.
4667120	4669120	No, I don't know why we were pulling up in front of the improv.
4669120	4671120	He came out from the improv.
4671120	4675120	He came by and he put his head down in the car and he goes, where are you girls
4675120	4676120	going?
4681120	4683120	And first I said, shit.
4683120	4684120	That's Bruce Willis.
4684120	4686120	Wait, but you knew him from what?
4686120	4687120	Moonlighting?
4687120	4688120	What?
4688120	4689120	Probably.
4689120	4690120	Okay.
4690120	4691120	Yeah.
4691120	4692120	We're going back here.
4692120	4693120	We're going really far back.
4693120	4696120	And I just said, you know, we're not going anywhere.
4696120	4697120	I don't know what I said.
4697120	4698120	Where were you going?
4698120	4701120	Put his hand in the car and slap me across the face.
4701120	4702120	What the fuck?
4702120	4704120	Was it playful, though?
4704120	4706120	You were pulling into...
4706120	4707120	Wait, it seems like you liked it.
4707120	4709120	Why are they questioning me?
4709120	4711120	Was it playful?
4711120	4712120	Why didn't you report it?
4712120	4713120	Tell me what happened.
4713120	4715120	It wasn't before the days of me, too.
4715120	4718120	Okay, but was it playful or was it really hard?
4718120	4722120	I think he was pissed off because I rejected him.
4722120	4723120	He was pissed off.
4723120	4724120	I would have slapped you.
4724120	4728120	Learn to take a compliment.
4728120	4732120	I think I might have mentioned this on the show before.
4732120	4739120	He once knocked me over at a bar because I was with a girl that looked a little too much like Demi Moore.
4739120	4740120	Yeah, there you go.
4740120	4742120	And he jumped over a thing and just fucking...
4742120	4748120	He like hockey checked me up against the boards and I almost went to the ground.
4748120	4749120	He absolutely nailed me.
4749120	4751120	It wasn't because he was trying to.
4751120	4754120	He saw a girl he wanted to talk to and I was in the way.
4754120	4756120	He was right, exactly.
4756120	4759120	He completely just fucking shoulder-checked me.
4759120	4762120	What would be a Sam essence for Bruce Willis?
4762120	4763120	Douchebag.
4763120	4764120	Come on.
4764120	4766120	Knock it off.
4766120	4767120	The poor guy.
4767120	4768120	It was just curious.
4768120	4770120	His only crime is being so visible.
4770120	4771120	Wait, why?
4771120	4775120	I think it's such a cool thing that I like to hear the way that he would.
4775120	4777120	No, but I'm saying, what would he be?
4777120	4778120	He says, Douchebag.
4778120	4779120	Oh, he's an asshole.
4780120	4783120	Yippee-ki-yay, mommy issues.
4786120	4788120	I really like Hudson Hawk.
4788120	4789120	I like Hudson Hawk.
4789120	4790120	I like that movie.
4790120	4791120	You're the one.
4791120	4794120	What would his essences be?
4794120	4797120	Hey, uh...
4797120	4799120	Hey, uh...
4799120	4800120	California.
4800120	4804120	All things considered, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
4804120	4808120	His essences would be along the lines of some of the things.
4808120	4811120	He'd be like, hey, uh...
4811120	4814120	What are you doing over here?
4814120	4815120	It's me, Bruce Willis.
4815120	4817120	That's not an essence.
4817120	4818120	Uh...
4818120	4820120	Oh, uh...
4820120	4823120	Look, what's going on over here?
4823120	4826120	I'm coming up with it.
4826120	4828120	Bruce Willis' essence.
4828120	4829120	Oh, uh...
4829120	4831120	Hey.
4832120	4835120	Sam Christensen is turning in his grave right now.
4835120	4838120	No, Sam's like, you can do it, Dan. You can do it.
4838120	4840120	I'm going to come up with it.
4840120	4842120	This is Bruce Willis' top essence.
4842120	4845120	Hey, uh...
4845120	4848120	You put a plant in a pot?
4848120	4851120	You got a potted plant?
4851120	4853120	That's pretty good.
4853120	4856120	Tell me I'm fucking wrong.
4856120	4858120	You put a pot in a plant?
4858120	4860120	You got a potted plant?
4860120	4862120	What essence is that, though?
4862120	4864120	That's Bruce Willis' essence.
4864120	4866120	What do you mean, what essence is that?
4866120	4869120	What are you describing about him?
4869120	4870120	You put a...
4870120	4872120	Hey, you put a pot in a plant?
4872120	4875120	A plant in a pot? Sorry, I fucked it up.
4875120	4879120	It's about... It's for him. It's not for you.
4879120	4882120	It's how he centers himself before an audition.
4882120	4886120	Which he doesn't have to do anymore because he fucking figured it out.
4886120	4889120	Sorry he slapped you. That's not cool.
4889120	4891120	People shouldn't slap people.
4891120	4894120	In the 70s, in the 80s, everyone's slapping everybody.
4894120	4896120	A lot of people were drugged.
4896120	4899120	There were nine people in the world, and he was one of them.
4899120	4901120	So it's like, what do I do?
4901120	4903120	He was one of the nine people slapped me.
4903120	4906120	This is the problem I have with the story.
4906120	4908120	So you're pulling into the improv.
4908120	4910120	Oh, my God.
4910120	4913120	You're pulling into the improv,
4913120	4916120	and then Bruce Willis says,
4916120	4920120	Hey, where are you going? You're pulling into the improv.
4920120	4924120	Was he wearing a vest? Did he have flashlights?
4924120	4926120	Hey, where are you going?
4926120	4928120	There's a sign...
4928120	4931120	Because if the answer is the improv, you get validated.
4931120	4933120	You're pulling into the improv.
4933120	4935120	Hey, where are you going?
4935120	4937120	We're not going anywhere.
4937120	4939120	That part of the story took me up, too.
4939120	4942120	I know you are, but I'm saying he was probably saying,
4942120	4944120	Hey, what are you doing?
4944120	4947120	I know what his technique was, because it was the improv.
4947120	4950120	You be Cody's mom. I'll be Bruce Willis.
4950120	4953120	Hey, where are you going?
4957120	4959120	What?
4959120	4963120	For our listeners, that was rolling down a window.
4963120	4967120	Cast your minds back into the foggy mist of time.
4967120	4969120	A Jimmy Carter-era window.
4969120	4972120	Did you see how long the crank was?
4973120	4975120	The radius.
4975120	4980120	Apparently, she was in an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
4980120	4984120	She was also the size of a mouse.
4986120	4989120	Hey, where are you going?
4989120	4992120	We just got here. We're going nowhere.
4992120	4994120	Where are you going?
4994120	4996120	The improv.
4996120	4999120	Hey, you like improv?
5000120	5003120	You can't deny. You can't ask questions.
5003120	5005120	Nope.
5005120	5007120	Suck my dick.
5007120	5009120	Yes, and?
5009120	5011120	What? Oh, she's rolling up the window.
5011120	5013120	I was just saying, like, he...
5013120	5016120	You can't go fuck yours, man.
5018120	5021120	My point was, what in the fuck?
5021120	5024120	Tonight's show's...
5024120	5028120	That he picked that spot because it was like a thing.
5028120	5030120	Where are you going? Your answer's supposed to be,
5030120	5032120	I'm going to the improv, and he's like...
5032120	5034120	You weren't going into the improv.
5034120	5036120	If you want to improvise, fuck Bruce Willis.
5036120	5038120	Where were you going? That's what I asked her for.
5038120	5040120	I don't know. I don't remember.
5040120	5042120	We're going to the improv.
5042120	5044120	No, we weren't.
5044120	5046120	Where were we going?
5046120	5048120	I don't remember.
5048120	5051120	You know what? We may not have been in the front of the improv.
5051120	5053120	Now that I think about it...
5053120	5057120	I'm just saying it was somewhere where we were pulled up.
5057120	5059120	I don't know. I don't remember.
5059120	5061120	The story's falling apart, right?
5061120	5063120	This was not even Bruce Willis.
5063120	5065120	He probably pulled up to Bruce Willis's house.
5065120	5067120	We probably pulled up to Bruce Willis's house.
5067120	5070120	I'm going to call...
5070120	5072120	You were trespassing.
5072120	5076120	You were stealing his diehard gargoyles.
5076120	5078120	Hey, what are you doing?
5078120	5081120	I had those built because I'm proud of being a diehard.
5081120	5084120	You're like, I don't fucking know.
5084120	5087120	He tried to grab them and he slapped you.
5087120	5090120	What the fuck are you doing?
5090120	5092120	I got two things I like.
5092120	5095120	My gargoyles and my diehard mailbox.
5095120	5098120	Now the truth comes out.
5098120	5101120	Mama LaRusso, the character, let's dig in.
5101120	5103120	Is she Italian or Jewish?
5103120	5106120	Yeah.
5106120	5108120	You got to eat the mic.
5108120	5110120	The name LaRusso...
5110120	5112120	They were Italian.
5112120	5114120	Where were they from?
5114120	5116120	Reseda?
5116120	5118120	Jersey.
5118120	5120120	They were in Reseda.
5120120	5124120	They were moving to Los Angeles.
5124120	5128120	They pulled up in Reseda to a place they were going to live.
5128120	5130120	Tell me about Elizabeth Shue.
5130120	5132120	Cute, young.
5132120	5134120	She was like 18.
5134120	5136120	How old was Ralph Maci?
5136120	5139120	Ralph was about 22.
5139120	5141120	No way.
5141120	5143120	He looked like a 14-year-old.
5143120	5145120	Hollywood lied!
5145120	5148120	First of all, props to Macio.
5148120	5151120	We're not age-shaming him.
5151120	5154120	I would have assumed absolutely the opposite.
5154120	5156120	No shame to Elizabeth.
5156120	5159120	When you watch that movie through nowadays eyes, you're like,
5159120	5162120	Jesus Christ, there were so few people in the world
5162120	5165120	that we always had to cast adults as teenagers.
5165120	5168120	Elizabeth Shue is gorgeous.
5168120	5171120	She very much feels like she's his mom.
5171120	5173120	She was very mature.
5173120	5175120	She feels like a grown-ass woman.
5175120	5177120	He looked like his hormones had kicked in.
5177120	5179120	He's very convincingly 14.
5179120	5181120	He was 22?
5181120	5183120	He was 16.
5183120	5185120	I mean 22 playing 16.
5185120	5188120	When I got hired, I had to audition with him.
5188120	5190120	I walked out and I said,
5190120	5192120	God, I'm only 36.
5192120	5194120	And he's 22.
5194120	5197120	Because he looked so young.
5197120	5199120	Oh, did you feel like, yeah.
5199120	5203120	So you get the call or your agent goes,
5203120	5208120	the name of the part is Mama LaRusso.
5208120	5212120	Was there ever, as a female actor, do you have to go through?
5212120	5215120	I've dated an actor or two here and there
5215120	5220120	and experienced some existential crises
5220120	5223120	where the actor goes,
5223120	5225120	what the fuck?
5225120	5227120	And they're like, why am I getting,
5227120	5230120	why is my agent telling me to audition for this soccer mom
5230120	5232120	and this Ford commercial?
5232120	5235120	Was there a line where you?
5235120	5237120	No, I was just happy to work.
5237120	5241120	I came to LA and that was one of my first jobs.
5241120	5243120	I wasn't even thinking about it.
5243120	5245120	It was just that he looked so young.
5245120	5248120	And when I found out he was 22 and I was only 36.
5248120	5251120	In the script, I don't think it was Mama LaRusso.
5252120	5254120	What was the character's first name?
5254120	5255120	But I read it.
5255120	5258120	I thought it was such a little gem even when I first read it.
5258120	5260120	You recognized that it was satisfying.
5260120	5262120	Oh, I didn't think it was going to become like a dick.
5262120	5265120	But I said, wow, that's a beautiful story.
5265120	5268120	And great part for an Asian man.
5268120	5270120	Pat Morita.
5270120	5273120	Pat Morita was only 17 in that.
5273120	5276120	It's just super, I did this podcast called Whiting Wags
5276120	5278120	with Jessica Gao.
5279120	5280120	It's weird.
5280120	5283120	Millennials don't...
5283120	5284120	Pat Morita wanted...
5284120	5286120	Did he win an Oscar for that?
5286120	5288120	No, but he was nominated.
5288120	5289120	He was nominated.
5289120	5292120	Try to imagine a world where Pat Morita, who speaks like you and I...
5292120	5294120	Not anymore.
5294120	5296120	Well, not anymore.
5296120	5299120	That's a ghoulish...
5299120	5302120	You said I was like the devil.
5302120	5304120	What about him?
5305120	5308120	And then he's playing this guy.
5308120	5311120	He's cast for the shape of his face, for his lineage or whatever.
5311120	5312120	And he's...
5312120	5316120	Our confusing relationship with whitewashing and all this stuff.
5316120	5318120	Pat Morita was nominated for an Oscar
5318120	5323120	because he played a Japanese national immigrant.
5323120	5324120	And...
5324120	5326120	He talk like this.
5326120	5328120	Daniel's son.
5328120	5331120	And in the midst of talking like this.
5331120	5337120	Which is one genealogy branch from being Mickey Rourke in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
5337120	5339120	But he's Japanese.
5339120	5340120	He's Asian.
5340120	5341120	Mickey Rourke.
5341120	5342120	What did I say?
5342120	5343120	Mickey Rourke.
5343120	5344120	That would have been good.
5344120	5345120	Fat check.
5345120	5346120	I do that every day.
5346120	5347120	Fat check.
5347120	5349120	But...
5349120	5352120	The modern lens, it's like what are you doing?
5352120	5353120	Are you not supposed to do that?
5353120	5355120	Do you think it was racist?
5355120	5357120	Well, I'm 46.
5357120	5358120	So I don't...
5359120	5361120	I was socialized not to...
5361120	5363120	But through a modern lens, you're supposed to go,
5363120	5365120	oh, this is everything that's wrong with everything.
5365120	5367120	Because it's like, well...
5367120	5370120	It's very, very confusing when it comes to casting.
5370120	5377120	Like this idea of, oh, why did you cast this white person as this blah, blah, blah,
5377120	5379120	when you could have cast this person.
5379120	5380120	It's...
5380120	5382120	Your brain kind of understands it to a certain point.
5382120	5387120	But it gets a little confusing between generations because there was...
5387120	5391120	I remember at that time, there was absolutely...
5391120	5398120	There was no question of whether or not Pat Morita was very deserving of accolades
5398120	5404120	for being on screen going, oh, Daniel, son, you should do karate more better.
5404120	5407120	Oh, you do it this way instead of that way.
5407120	5409120	And I'm not knocking his...
5409120	5413120	Because the whole point is he acted the shit out of it.
5413120	5415120	He was doing a thick, weird accent.
5415120	5417120	It was a stereotype.
5417120	5421120	And it put you in the shoes of this kid who's like, the weird handyman is like,
5421120	5422120	hey, so what are you...
5422120	5423120	I'm Brooklyn.
5423120	5426120	I don't know nothing about nothing.
5426120	5427120	I went from back to Jersey.
5427120	5429120	All I do is do this.
5429120	5436120	And he's like, oh, Daniel, son, yeah, you fix a sink, but you know, fix a soul.
5436120	5439120	And the whole thing had this chemistry to it.
5439120	5441120	It was very charismatic.
5441120	5443120	And why am I bringing this up?
5443120	5444120	I don't know.
5445120	5446120	Pat Morita's dead now.
5446120	5449120	Pat Morita was nominated for an Oscar for that.
5449120	5451120	Like, I don't know.
5451120	5457120	I guess one of the things it brings up is that they redid the Karate Kid.
5457120	5460120	They did the series, and you were on that series.
5460120	5461120	It's on now, yeah.
5461120	5465120	I haven't seen that, but what's the deal with the Karate Kid series?
5465120	5471120	Like, isn't Ralph Macchio in it, but he's not like the good guy, right?
5471120	5473120	Well, they're 56 years old now.
5474120	5476120	Isn't the series about kind of how he's sort of...
5476120	5479120	Is he straight a little bit in terms of values?
5479120	5481120	He's not like a heroic innocent.
5481120	5485120	He's a Karate Kid, so now he's like drunk on power doing coke.
5485120	5487120	And I hear he beats a few women in it.
5487120	5489120	And he's like, I'm waxing you on!
5489120	5490120	I'm waxing you on!
5490120	5491120	That's a great series, no.
5491120	5494120	But the Cobra Kai are like sympathetic or whatever?
5494120	5495120	No, no, no.
5495120	5497120	They're grown now.
5497120	5500120	The two men, you know, Lawrence.
5501120	5502120	What's the main dude?
5502120	5503120	The blonde guy.
5503120	5504120	What's his name?
5504120	5505120	Billy Zapkin.
5505120	5506120	But what's a character?
5506120	5507120	Johnny, right?
5507120	5508120	Do you watch it?
5508120	5509120	Who is that?
5509120	5510120	Is that my husband?
5510120	5511120	That's your husband.
5511120	5512120	Oh, that's my husband!
5514120	5515120	I had to say reaction.
5515120	5518120	I'm like, whoa, big Karate Kid, but it's your husband.
5518120	5520120	He read the call sheet.
5522120	5523120	Billy Zapkin!
5524120	5525120	Thank you.
5525120	5527120	No, they're rivals again.
5527120	5529120	I had to run all his lines!
5531120	5532120	His favorite color's green!
5532120	5534120	For God's sakes, get your shit together!
5535120	5537120	You put me through hell!
5539120	5541120	That's called Cobra Kai.
5541120	5542120	Is there anybody watching it?
5543120	5544120	Uh-oh.
5544120	5545120	Oh!
5547120	5549120	It's doing really well.
5549120	5553120	The good news is that response means eight million people are watching it.
5553120	5554120	There's so much TV.
5554120	5555120	It's just Aerosol missed it.
5555120	5556120	It doesn't matter.
5557120	5562120	Anybody watching Green River?
5562120	5563120	No.
5563120	5564120	See?
5564120	5565120	Yeah.
5565120	5566120	A million people watching it.
5566120	5567120	And that's a show I made up.
5570120	5572120	No, they're rivals again.
5572120	5573120	And they're grown up now.
5573120	5577120	And Billy Zapkin's character has a dojo.
5577120	5581120	And oh, it's so hard to explain.
5581120	5582120	You don't have to.
5582120	5583120	But they're rivals now again.
5583120	5584120	Not gonna watch it.
5585120	5588120	We've reached the point of the show where I'm so drunk that...
5588120	5592120	They actually did a great job bringing it into today's world.
5592120	5594120	Does Ralph slap you across the face?
5594120	5595120	Yes.
5596120	5599120	No, it's good.
5599120	5601120	I think it's good, yeah.
5601120	5603120	All right, give us some Jon Hamm stories.
5603120	5605120	You were on Mad Men.
5605120	5607120	Like, what does this dick look like?
5608120	5610120	I heard it's very large.
5611120	5613120	I hope he's not listening to this.
5613120	5615120	He probably is, but you know what?
5616120	5617120	Big deal.
5617120	5621120	Oh, Jon, sorry, we're spreading the rumor about your big giant dick again.
5622120	5626120	But here's a thousand dick-shaped violins playing for his giant dick.
5626120	5629120	No, because everyone knows about it, because there were pictures and stuff.
5629120	5631120	Tell the wig story.
5631120	5633120	Oh, you tell it.
5633120	5634120	Tell it.
5634120	5635120	He's good at this.
5635120	5639120	So Randy's having a four-hour makeup done to age her.
5639120	5642120	And the makeup lady says to her, maybe I'm making up half this, but it's fine.
5642120	5643120	Me, it makes up.
5643120	5647120	So the makeup says, I heard Matthew Weiner say...
5647120	5649120	No, it's wrong already.
5651120	5655120	No, so my character has this big wig and aging.
5655120	5657120	You know, they aged me up.
5657120	5664120	And there was a scene where I was wearing the wig, and I had to...
5664120	5665120	Oh, I tilted it.
5665120	5666120	Oh, this is going to be terrible.
5666120	5667120	I'm telling it already.
5667120	5668120	I tell it better.
5668120	5670120	Yeah, it's canceled, canceled.
5671120	5676120	So the wig person says, I heard Matthew Weiner said, it might be funny if you adjusted your wig in the scene.
5676120	5679120	So she said, oh, well, I think I'll do that then.
5679120	5682120	So she gets to the first take, and she adjusts the wig.
5682120	5685120	And then they do the second take, and she adjusts the wig.
5685120	5687120	And she says to John, John, too much?
5687120	5690120	He said, first take, yes, second take, no.
5690120	5692120	That was what happened.
5694120	5696120	I don't really have any John Hamm stories.
5696120	5698120	It was great to work on that show.
5698120	5699120	I had a great time.
5699120	5700120	He's a good guy.
5700120	5701120	He's a huge dick.
5701120	5702120	And he's beautiful.
5702120	5703120	And he has a big dick.
5703120	5704120	No, I don't.
5704120	5707120	In my experience, it's big, but it's weird.
5707120	5708120	Yeah.
5708120	5709120	Oh, really?
5709120	5710120	It's a big, weird dick.
5710120	5711120	It's shaped like an ampersand.
5711120	5712120	Like a ham?
5712120	5713120	Like a ham?
5713120	5714120	Like Liam Neeson.
5714120	5716120	He has an ampersand dick.
5716120	5717120	We're going down the hill here.
5717120	5719120	His dick is like a treble clef.
5719120	5721120	It's very curvilinear.
5721120	5726120	And honestly, John Hamm, if you're listening, or if any of your representatives are, come on the show.
5726120	5727120	Clear your name.
5727120	5728120	That's right.
5728120	5730120	I challenge John Hamm to come on the show.
5730120	5731120	Show us your dick.
5731120	5732120	Show us your dick.
5732120	5735120	Take out a little bit to win.
5735120	5739120	Let's get Bruce Willis and John Hamm, and we'll have Bruce slap John Hamm's dick.
5742120	5743120	I still don't know.
5743120	5744120	Such an exciting career.
5744120	5745120	I feel like Sam.
5745120	5746120	Sam is watching.
5746120	5749120	He's still like, you guys didn't do it yet.
5749120	5751120	You didn't do that thing that I need you to do.
5751120	5752120	See, I didn't go to his class.
5752120	5754120	I should have gone.
5754120	5756120	He needs us to be true to ourselves.
5756120	5757120	Sam wants me.
5757120	5768120	Sam was always like, I feel like when I went to Sam's class, the thing that Sam was always suggesting to me that I wish that he wasn't gone so that I could, like, I feel like I was incomplete.
5768120	5773120	Like, Sam was always saying to me, okay, Dan, but why don't you do that?
5773120	5776120	But, like, what if you weren't allowed to scream?
5776120	5786120	Like, because I thought, not being a very good actor, like, I was, when I learned how to yell, I was like, ooh, this is great acting.
5787120	5792120	You're telling me, speak the speech, I pray you, tripping like I'm telling you, like, oh, I'm yelling.
5792120	5798120	And then Sam's thing was always like, okay, Dan, but, like, what if you were afraid to do that?
5798120	5800120	What if you had to sit on your rage?
5800120	5801120	How would that manifest itself?
5801120	5803120	And I was never able to do that.
5803120	5814120	All of my stuff was, like, how wounded I was and how, you know, how dishonestly that would manifest itself.
5814120	5820120	And I never got to, I don't know.
5820120	5821120	Yeah.
5821120	5822120	I don't know.
5822120	5828120	My memories of Sam, they're incomplete because they make me go, Sam, give me more attention.
5828120	5830120	Tell me I did something.
5830120	5839120	Tell me, I always, I weirdly pictured Sam when I was 70 that Sam would still be, I never thought about him as having an age or immortality.
5839120	5842120	I thought he'd be, like, hanging out and he'd be like, you did it.
5842120	5843120	Good job.
5843120	5844120	You're 70.
5844120	5850120	You did a great job in that eulogy or, like, you did it.
5850120	5853120	I was watching you on that.
5853120	5863120	There's so many things that he said, like, just with one line, like, with one, like, little statement that, like, completely transformed the way I thought about things.
5864120	5871120	And he told me, one thing that I'll never forget, he said, Jeff, he goes, you make it all too hard.
5871120	5875120	He goes, you think, you overthink it, you're making it harder than it is.
5875120	5877120	And he goes, just do it.
5877120	5878120	Like, just say the words.
5878120	5881120	He goes, you have tricks that you use.
5881120	5883120	And he goes, don't use them.
5883120	5886120	Like, just say the words.
5886120	5888120	He goes, do it again and just say it.
5888120	5891120	And then all the emotion comes out.
5891120	5898120	When you're not lying and you're not pretending, like, he just had a way of, like, terrifying you into honesty.
5898120	5908120	But without being terrifying, he never, also, he said, when I first took his class, I sat down and he told a story.
5908120	5911120	There was a girl that was in the class and it was the first day.
5911120	5920120	And he brought her down in the same way that he brought, like, when he first started the class, he'd just bring random person out of 15 of us, sit in the chair.
5920120	5925120	He would just say, like, there was this woman that sat in the chair, you know, like, probably 20-year-old girl.
5925120	5934120	He said, raise your hand, the rest of you, if you think that she is the first one in the pool or the last, and the last one out.
5934120	5936120	And nobody raised their hand.
5936120	5944120	And he goes, raise your hand if you think that she, her bedroom is everything in its place and right where it should be.
5944120	5945120	And everybody raised their hand.
5945120	5947120	And she started crying.
5947120	5950120	And Sam freaked because he's not there to make people cry.
5950120	5954120	He's not one of those acting teachers that wants to break you down to build you back up.
5954120	5955120	He's never like that.
5955120	5957120	And he's like, oh, shit, like, why are you crying?
5957120	5965120	And she goes, I'm in a silver medal, like, athlete, Olympic swimmer.
5965120	5968120	I have three silver medals.
5968120	5971120	And nobody thinks I'm a swimmer.
5972120	5979120	But if you look at her, Sam was like, if you look at her, short hair, the shoulders, the build, like, the tan, like, she looks like a swimmer.
5979120	5983120	But like, no, but she goes, why don't people perceive me as a swimmer?
5983120	5984120	I've gone out on a thousand-
5984120	5986120	How much swimming do I have to do?
5986120	5987120	Yeah.
5987120	5989120	And she said to him, and she's crying.
5989120	5994120	And she goes, I've gone on a thousand commercial auditions as an athlete, as a swimmer.
5994120	5999120	And last year I went out and actually brought one of my silver medals, which you're not supposed to do.
5999120	6001120	You're not supposed to advertise that.
6001120	6003120	And I still couldn't get a call back on it.
6003120	6005120	And he said, do you have an agent?
6005120	6006120	And she says, yes.
6006120	6010120	And Sam said, go to your agent tomorrow and say, no more athlete stuff.
6010120	6015120	It's behind the desk, everything in its place, everything just so.
6015120	6018120	And he just met her.
6018120	6022120	Behind the desk, everything in its place, everything just so.
6022120	6024120	She told her agents that.
6024120	6026120	She booked three commercials that week.
6026120	6033120	Because he completely goes like, you're a swimmer, but we see you as something else.
6033120	6036120	Goldie Hahn is an intellectual, but we want her to play in our head.
6036120	6037120	Right.
6037120	6041120	Because that's what she's bringing to the mythological table.
6041120	6046120	There was another story that fits in with that one, which I think it intersects with the Pat Morita thing,
6046120	6049120	which is in an area where it's sort of confusing to me.
6049120	6052120	What's our job as actors, and what's our job as producers in casting?
6053120	6058120	There was a woman in his class that she was like, look, I feel like I want to be an actor.
6058120	6061120	And I was like, she takes the class, and she's doing the exercises,
6061120	6063120	and she's getting flustered and more flustered.
6063120	6066120	And something is eating away at her.
6066120	6068120	It's clear.
6068120	6070120	And it builds and builds and builds.
6070120	6073120	And then there's that class where she just sort of breaks down.
6073120	6076120	And she starts, she just breaks down.
6076120	6078120	And this is a story I heard third hand.
6078120	6080120	And Sam goes, what's wrong?
6080120	6081120	What's happening?
6081120	6084120	And she goes, look, who are we fucking kidding?
6084120	6087120	And then she described herself, and I can't remember the description.
6087120	6097120	The part of the story is the, she's like, I'm a 280 pound, half Filipino, 45 year old woman.
6097120	6100120	And I decided I want to be an actor.
6100120	6102120	What the fuck am I doing?
6102120	6107120	She went on this rant that included like just this, her perceived evisceration of herself,
6107120	6112120	which included just a functional cataloging of what she was.
6112120	6115120	And Sam's response was, I want you to go home tonight,
6115120	6121120	and I want you to take however many headshots you have left,
6121120	6128120	put them each in an envelope, and write, don't open this unless you want a 45 year old half Filipino, blah, blah, blah.
6128120	6131120	Like whatever she said, don't open it.
6131120	6133120	Don't open it unless you want that.
6133120	6137120	On each of the envelopes, I want you to send it to all these people that you've sent it to.
6137120	6143120	And it was the, she was the receptionist on Northern Exposure, which Millennials don't know.
6143120	6153120	There was a shot, that was that actor that was like, you're looking, it was just sort of like,
6153120	6156120	I don't know how to file that.
6156120	6160120	It's this story of the, that's what Sam's magic was.
6160120	6165120	It's like, turn this thing that you think is an obstacle into this evil Knievel ramp
6165120	6169120	and leap into the sky and have everyone look at you and notice these things.
6169120	6175120	It's almost counterintuitive to what we now profess politically and philosophically.
6175120	6182120	The things that we're trying to overcome is like, well, don't, you shouldn't be noticing that I look like this.
6182120	6185120	And your first instinct about who I am is actually your problem.
6185120	6188120	You should be actually finding your shame about it.
6188120	6194120	And I don't know, I guess I always thought I would watch Sam grow and progress into that era
6194120	6197120	and see how he reacted to it.
6197120	6199120	I know that Sam was very internet averse.
6199120	6205120	He was always so, we would walk into class with our cell phones when they were first developing.
6205120	6210120	And the palm tree on, he's like, Dan, are you, is that your phone?
6210120	6217120	Like, yeah, he's like, did you know that that consumes three times as much energy as a refrigerator per week?
6218120	6221120	Sorry, class isn't started yet.
6221120	6227120	But he was, he was like very, part of, part of Sam to me always felt like he was,
6227120	6230120	he was very sad to watch the world progress.
6230120	6233120	He felt like it was becoming less and less human and stuff.
6233120	6238120	And I hate to beat a dead horse, but I guess I'm going to Bob and saying,
6238120	6243120	tell me, tell me he went away not going,
6243120	6246120	Jesus Christ, you people are fucked up.
6247120	6250120	The thing about when you got your essences,
6250120	6253120	and then you have to go in front of the class and say them all.
6253120	6258120	And what's amazing is that everybody in the, you think they're either going to boo or cheer,
6258120	6263120	but what they do is they just laugh and they go, oh, it's so cool that that person knows.
6263120	6272120	Like there was a girl in my first class and she was this really good looking Latina,
6273120	6277120	and she hated one of her essences and it was hot tamale.
6277120	6280120	And she's like, she's like, I fucking hate this one.
6280120	6283120	I fucking hate it. I hate it. We're all dying laughing.
6283120	6285120	And he goes, why do you hate it?
6285120	6288120	And she goes, because I've been called hot tamale my entire life.
6288120	6292120	And he goes, and you always will be yours, but you have to,
6292120	6295120	like there's two, there's two stages.
6295120	6297120	It's acknowledging it and then embracing it.
6297120	6299120	And you have to throw your arms and go, fuck it.
6299120	6301120	I'm a hot tamale.
6301120	6307120	Or Goldie Hannes to embrace the fact that she's like America's airhead,
6307120	6311120	even though she's like a giant intellect.
6311120	6316120	And church has sent me an awesome quote from Nick Cave.
6316120	6318120	Embrace your flaws.
6318120	6322120	They're the only thing of interest that you have.
6322120	6324120	Like your flaws are what makes you.
6324120	6328120	And that's absolutely like Sam would have absolutely dug that
6328120	6333120	because that's what he, he just had a way of like looking at you and going,
6333120	6338120	Jeff, someone said, Hey, I sent someone to his class and I sent a million
6338120	6341120	people to his class. And if you like spread it all out,
6341120	6343120	my first girlfriend that sent me there,
6343120	6346120	there must've been a thousand people that went there, including like,
6346120	6349120	you know, you guys.
6349120	6353120	Oh, fuck. I've lost my train of thought.
6353120	6357120	He had a way of just like, oh, so I said, I sent somebody to the class
6357120	6361120	and my friend called me up and he goes, Hey, Sam says hi.
6361120	6365120	And he also said, tell Jeff he's an asshole.
6365120	6367120	And he'll get it.
6367120	6372120	And I laughed because he's like, tell Jeff you're an asshole.
6372120	6377120	And that's Sam going like, remind him that he should call me more.
6377120	6382120	Like he only spoke to you in truth and absolutely essentially.
6382120	6384120	And it's the best.
6384120	6390120	I feel like for me, Sam was the anchor of everything.
6390120	6395120	When every anything was going through your mind that you needed help with,
6395120	6398120	that you needed advice on, that you needed a perspective on,
6398120	6401120	that you had not thought of, he was the anchor.
6401120	6406120	And what was interesting is I was with him when the night Obama was elected
6406120	6409120	and I was with him the night Trump was elected.
6409120	6413120	And on both nights he cried.
6414120	6416120	For the same reason.
6416120	6419120	He's like, God, I'm so racist.
6419120	6422120	No, I can't remember what.
6422120	6426120	But we haven't really addressed Sam's racism.
6426120	6428120	See, it seems it's like mentor.
6428120	6429120	He just screams mentor.
6429120	6432120	You're saying even though he's like, he's a close friend of yours.
6432120	6436120	So you're not going to like label him as a mentor because he's like your buddy.
6436120	6439120	But at the same time, what you're saying is an anchor.
6439120	6441120	He was there.
6441120	6446120	Did that position, did that cause him pain?
6446120	6448120	Was he weary of that?
6448120	6451120	Did he wish that there was like, yeah, I get it.
6451120	6455120	Everyone wants to hear whether or not they need to feel good about themselves.
6455120	6456120	Jesus fucking Christ.
6456120	6460120	Is anyone going to ask me a goddamn question about what the fuck I want?
6460120	6463120	Is that me projecting?
6463120	6466120	He lived in extreme back pain and stuff like that.
6466120	6476120	I wonder if part of being so empathetic that you take on another...
6476120	6478120	Use your microphone.
6478120	6479120	Sorry.
6479120	6481120	Do you think he embodied people's pain?
6481120	6482120	I don't know.
6482120	6484120	That's something that Bob would do.
6484120	6487120	I think he was a very devoted teacher.
6487120	6491120	I feel like if you're so good at spotting other people's pain,
6491120	6493120	you have to wear that pain.
6493120	6495120	You're an antenna for that kind of stuff.
6495120	6498120	I feel like it eased his pain.
6498120	6502120	Other people's pain would ease his pain because he would solve it for them.
6502120	6504120	He was happy doing that.
6504120	6506120	He wasn't like invoicing it.
6506120	6507120	No.
6507120	6508120	It's interesting.
6508120	6510120	He's a teacher too.
6510120	6514120	Years ago, there was a televangelist named Terri Cole Whittaker,
6514120	6516120	who I became friends with.
6516120	6521120	She was very successful and she sold DVDs and books,
6521120	6524120	a book called What You Think Of Me Is None Of My Business
6524120	6526120	and all this stuff and everything.
6526120	6527120	Finally, she quit.
6527120	6528120	She said, I'm quitting.
6528120	6529120	I said, why are you quitting?
6529120	6532120	She said, because I feel like I'm everybody's crutch
6532120	6534120	and I don't want to be everybody's crutch.
6534120	6535120	I want to live my life.
6535120	6537120	Sam did not feel like that.
6537120	6538120	He didn't feel like that.
6538120	6539120	He wasn't people's crutch.
6539120	6543120	He taught people and he had his own private life away from that.
6543120	6549120	His relationship with me was not like, I'm your crutch.
6550120	6552120	It was friends, but it was also give and take
6552120	6555120	because I would advise him too.
6555120	6559120	Let me throw something around you and see what you think of that
6559120	6563120	because we had interesting perspectives because we knew each other
6563120	6568120	for so long, for so many years that we could be objective about each other.
6569120	6572120	Well, it's like a favorite thing of his on the off chance
6572120	6574120	that we were to like, oh, we got a podcast.
6574120	6578120	What was the cause of Sam's as far as charity going one way or another?
6578120	6581120	We have a new thing in the podcast where we're like divert things.
6581120	6585120	Did Sam have a favorite actual like charity as far as like writing checks
6585120	6588120	or it's like, you know what I really love is puppies for poor people
6588120	6589120	or whatever.
6589120	6590120	Democrats.
6590120	6591120	Well, just straight up.
6591120	6592120	Democrats, Democrats.
6592120	6593120	He just loves them.
6593120	6596120	Have you seen the Michael Moore documentary though, the recent one?
6596120	6597120	No, I just told you about it.
6597120	6598120	God damn it.
6598120	6601120	Fucking shook us right into the birdie camp.
6601120	6603120	We were like, God damn Obama's a piece of shit.
6603120	6607120	Like I went, I did not, I did not expect the Michael Moore documentary
6607120	6610120	to make me go fuck Democrats.
6611120	6614120	It was a really disappointing story in it.
6614120	6620120	It was a weird, like, uh, pop-a-matic bubble of shit balls.
6620120	6622120	Like this whole thing is fucked.
6622120	6625120	I never, I, I, I guess I'm glad for it.
6625120	6631120	But anyways, I'd see, but Sam was like, it's like, like, like he, he,
6631120	6633120	he was a, he was a dyed in the wool Democrat.
6633120	6637120	He's like, look, we gotta, we gotta make this tent and like, like,
6637120	6638120	go straight forward.
6638120	6639120	He was a Hillary guy.
6639120	6643120	He's he would, he would have been a Pelosi guy slash Elizabeth Warren guy,
6643120	6644120	maybe or whatever.
6644120	6645120	Who knows?
6645120	6649120	But, but like Sam, Sam, Sam couldn't have been more punk rock,
6649120	6650120	but he was like practical.
6650120	6652120	He's like, let's fucking win this.
6652120	6653120	Stop dicking around.
6653120	6654120	Maybe is what he would.
6654120	6657120	He's also a huge donor to a California hair bears.
6658120	6661120	Um, all right.
6661120	6668120	Well, look, uh, Sam, I, uh, I feel like I'm suckling pig.
6668120	6673120	Like, I feel like I got so much of you.
6673120	6678120	I just, all I did was come to your, your trough and just like lick and suck
6678120	6680120	and selfishly preen.
6680120	6683120	Like, oh, I guess this guy tells me this and tells me that.
6683120	6688120	And I just, I never anticipated that he would be somebody that I, one of my
6688120	6692120	favorite times of my life was when, but you know, before you and I were working
6692120	6696120	and we would go to the rest again and we had an hour before class and you would
6696120	6702120	go home to your crap apartment, uh, in Los Feliz and Dan would write me a monologue
6702120	6705120	and then write himself a monologue and I would learn it in the car on the way
6705120	6707120	there and we would go in there and do it.
6707120	6712120	And Sam kept a lot of the monologues that Dan wrote like right before class.
6712120	6717120	And disseminated them to like a lot of students and some of the best shit
6717120	6723120	you've ever written with stuff that you wrote last second for, to go up there
6723120	6726120	and do, you know, like a minute long monologue.
6726120	6727120	Cause it was a great writing exercise.
6727120	6731120	You go to these classes and you go, oh, this guy's essence is, uh, I'm here to
6731120	6733120	pick your pocket and suck your dick or something.
6733120	6735120	And you'd be like, wow, that's specific.
6735120	6738120	And then you're like, okay, what if that guy had to talk for a minute?
6738120	6740120	Hey, I'm here to pick your pocket and suck your dick.
6740120	6742120	I'm here to pick your pocket and suck your dick.
6742120	6746120	It was like, like these essence are like writing for you, like writing monologues
6746120	6747120	for you.
6747120	6749120	You wrote, you wrote one for me.
6749120	6755120	It was like a CIA guy that was like jumps from train to train on top of it
6755120	6758120	and kills people and just brags about how much he loves being in the CIA
6758120	6759120	and killing people.
6759120	6762120	And you wrote that in like five minutes and it was fucking amazing.
6762120	6765120	Years before Chuck.
6765120	6769120	I mean, I was like, amazing.
6769120	6777120	There's a million anecdotes of Sam bringing out people's humanity and
6777120	6781120	bringing out their absolute honesty and quality.
6781120	6786120	Somebody getting up in class and looking at their cards and people wrote down
6786120	6788120	and a guy yelling, I'm not loud.
6788120	6793120	Or a woman going, hard to handle, fuck this class and walking outside.
6793120	6798120	Like people complaining about their own essence and doing an impression of
6798120	6799120	themselves.
6799120	6803120	Like there's no way to replace him.
6803120	6806120	I hope we're not boring you to death by a person that you don't know.
6806120	6808120	Well, what are they going to say to that?
6808120	6809120	Yeah, you are.
6809120	6811120	They're not going to know if they're good people.
6811120	6815120	I was in a long car ride with Drew Carey when I first met.
6815120	6818120	Very early when I knew him and I was telling him about Sam's class
6818120	6823120	and he was driving and he goes, I want to know who I am.
6823120	6825120	And he was like on the Drew Carey show.
6825120	6826120	He was like the number one show.
6826120	6829120	And he goes, I don't really know who I am.
6829120	6834120	And he took the class and he came to me and he goes, he sent everybody he knew
6834120	6835120	to Sam's class.
6835120	6837120	He goes, we think we know who we are.
6837120	6840120	There's compliments we wish people would pay us but they don't.
6840120	6844120	And there's insults that we wish people wouldn't pay us but they do.
6844120	6845120	And you have to own all that shit.
6845120	6850120	And my favorite essence of Drew's is doing the best I can with what I've got.
6850120	6851120	And he goes, he goes,
6851120	6852120	I'm doing the best I can with what I get.
6852120	6855120	He goes, I'll give you a free car if you want me to.
6855120	6856120	Yeah.
6856120	6857120	Yeah.
6857120	6859120	That's why he's brilliant on Price is Right.
6859120	6862120	It's because when Drew gives you a car, it's like, this is fucking amazing.
6862120	6863120	All right.
6863120	6866120	Well, we'll get another person to come up with this.
6866120	6870120	Yeah.
6870120	6873120	Shit fire in the wind.
6873120	6874120	Fuck me.
6874120	6875120	Oh.
6875120	6876120	Are you having a stroke?
6876120	6877120	What's going on?
6877120	6878120	Sam is gone now.
6878120	6880120	And so here's, look, here's my thing.
6881120	6882120	We're doing great buddy.
6882120	6883120	We're doing great.
6883120	6885120	But the first one is awesome.
6885120	6888120	I think we've heard a lot from some people.
6888120	6890120	Because there's not going to be another Sam.
6890120	6893120	And as we hear from these hot tamale stories,
6893120	6896120	actually Sam.
6896120	6897120	Yeah. If there was another Sam,
6897120	6900120	it wouldn't take the same form because tomorrow's Sam,
6900120	6903120	if they were identical the last year's Sam would be.
6903120	6905120	What the fuck? That's super racist or whatever.
6905120	6906120	Like.
6906120	6908120	Like it did.
6908120	6909120	Yeah.
6909120	6913640	intersected with is is there a way and like Instagram and Twitter are not gonna
6913640	6918520	they're not gonna be offering this to you no one is going to tell you that
6918520	6926520	this is important to explore yourself warts and all shame and all to pour hot
6926520	6934000	scalding water into yourself and see how low it goes and what pockets it fills
6934000	6939200	figure like like ask yourself these questions what are you ashamed of what
6939200	6944320	what do you think is is this is this thing that you refuse to hear about
6944320	6949040	yourself if somebody says this to you that's a deal-breaker you're gonna walk
6949040	6953160	away you're gonna if someone said this to you you're gonna explode because oh
6953160	6957920	my god that's your holy shit everyone says that to me nobody's ever said that
6957920	6963000	to me because I've done such a good job of protecting it you you you've got this
6963000	6968680	time on earth to like open your own hood and like go into that shit and like
6968680	6974440	figure it out the clues that Sam turned us on to were but I don't know if kids
6974440	6979280	these days ever passed notes like now that you guys grew up a cell phone so
6979280	6983560	why would you ever pass a note I had a box full of letters from girls I had
6983560	6987640	crushes on and vice versa that Sam was able to tell me go home and look at all
6987640	6991400	this of course I saved all those fucking notes from Gina and I was able to go
6991400	6997480	holy shit she's calling me capricious and aloof and interesting and organic
6997480	7003120	and then it's like slob weird lazy fucking nerd like like like and noticing
7003120	7007040	like what happens when people fall in and out of love with you but you have
7007040	7011320	your texts you can go back through them like what what do what do people say
7011320	7016120	about you then you can like search for yeah what do people say about you when
7016120	7019320	they're excited about you what do people say about you when they when they're
7019320	7023560	your biggest fan what do what do people say about you when they want to really
7023560	7027960	hurt you what's the worst thing that someone could say about you shit on a
7027960	7034440	scarf and then return it Sam Sam Sam I think if you were here would say start
7034440	7040520	there start coming up with adjectives for this stuff then get out of the Saurus
7040520	7044400	and look up the synonyms for those adjectives make big lists of the things
7044400	7048440	that people have said about you and then look at the synonyms for those things
7048440	7054600	and find words that spike your your rage your shame your silence your
7054600	7058480	emotions and start asking yourself what if I had permission to be these things
7058480	7062720	what if these things were the only point of me being around that might be a
7062720	7068120	really good direction to go as a writer I mean so many of our listeners like I
7068120	7072440	think a disproportionate amount of our listeners are aspiring writers because
7072440	7077760	I've snowed them into thinking I I'm a writer why am I self-deprecating I'm an
7077760	7083800	amazing writer I'm so drunk I'm sorry I what what am I essences is ends a show
7083800	7090640	badly there's no more we know a lot of people that have passed away but how
7090640	7096440	many people do we eulogize this much and why are we doing it and I think like and
7096440	7101360	I don't want to make myself cry because I'm a crier but uh he was a healer and
7101360	7105420	how many people can you say that about well because it's just somebody if it
7105420	7109220	was a Western it would be like well I get I get seven bullet holes on the back
7109220	7115820	of my jacket and looks like they all represent seven times that Sam saved my
7115820	7122980	life like I wouldn't be here it's unfair that he's gone and we're here if that's
7122980	7127780	why you I that's why I can't that's why I'm like scrambling to like what are we
7127780	7133780	supposed to do what 40 are we supposed to pull yeah I when I got the call my
7133780	7140020	first thought was I cannot imagine Sam not being on this planet that's that was
7140020	7143700	my feeling never thought about it and never thought about it it was never
7143700	7148740	something we've been talked about about that even being a possibility and he
7148740	7152700	came to my workshop I teach singing workshops and he came to my workshop one
7152700	7157980	night said I want to I really want to be a part of that and see what you do and
7157980	7162580	the next Friday night when we got together he said it's so interesting to
7162580	7168340	me that without us ever talking about it that what you're giving these people
7168340	7172540	is very similar to what I do so that if somebody came in and said I want to play
7172540	7177580	Eliza do little in my fair lady and I would say do you really feel a
7177580	7186500	connection with that character no I just like those songs that's that's not it you
7186500	7191940	you have to find out how the world sees you that will tell you how you're
7191940	7196220	castable and that will help you maneuver through life so that people are
7196220	7203460	receptive to you and you know he moved me every week of my life and I just I
7203460	7210660	cannot I haven't yet been able to wrap my head around the loss of this man who
7210660	7217180	was so dear and on Wednesday I have to sing at his funeral and it's gonna I
7217180	7226100	mean it's gonna be very difficult to Friday nights is you know it's Sam but
7226100	7233260	how lucky we all are and blessed is what I feel at the end of the day to have had
7233260	7239100	this man touch our lives in the way he did and you guys know about his buried
7239100	7250260	gold his Nazi gold oh yeah well why bury it then when I just let it be Nazi
7250260	7255260	gold and what if I had Nazi gold I wouldn't bury it I'd be like well it's
7255260	7261540	Nazi gold take it at your peril you're gonna bury your Nazi gold all right well
7261540	7264500	you're gonna leave your Nazi gold just hanging around what were you gonna say
7264500	7269260	nothing I was just I was gonna I was gonna agree with him saying that like
7269260	7276980	it's lucky to have met him and maybe nobody in our live audience but lots of
7276980	7280380	people that have listening are listening to us have met him or got to meet him
7280380	7288540	but really he's the reason why I am where I am and like he brought a lot of
7288540	7294140	people together and he was a real artist just by sitting in a chair and asking
7294140	7299780	simple questions and letting you be you it's pretty it's pretty crazy he would
7299780	7303020	listen to you do you have the shittiest monologue of the world thinking come in
7303020	7308300	and go like here's the thing whoa it's me hey I'm Johnny Greaseball and he
7308300	7312260	would just take it all in he went and he'd go why'd you why'd you pick this
7312260	7319500	piece I like Johnny Greaseball it's my favorite movie what's Johnny Greaseball
7319500	7324940	doing in this monologue he's well he's he's being kind of a shithead but don't
7324940	7328860	judge him don't judge him that was a big thing I learned from Sam as a writer
7328860	7332340	yeah don't judge that fucking character like when I was doing community it was
7332340	7337460	like no no no no like like like like never judge the character and like like
7337460	7342740	how dare you assume that your characters being a piece of shit no the character is
7342740	7346520	trying to accomplish something he's trying Johnny Greaseball what's he
7346520	7351840	trying to do he's trying to convince it trying to convince well have you ever
7351840	7358040	tried to convince somebody of something yeah like let's think about what have
7358040	7361440	you ever tried to convince somebody of think about something just anything oh
7361440	7367520	my mom I had to get her to cosign a car I bought like whoa you had to get your
7367520	7375920	mom to cosign a car loan wait how old were you 20 22 where were you I had to
7375920	7380320	go to her kitchenette and what was the wallpaper what did it look like it was
7380320	7384800	yellow go he would he would just you never knew when he was gonna do that go
7384800	7390680	and and you had the monologue memorized and you would memorize it as an actor
7390680	7394480	like you what you go away I'm Johnny Greaseball and here's why I always
7394480	7397800	somebody and then you go go and you're thinking about your mom's wallpaper and
7397800	7405000	trying to convince your mom and like you just be like I'm Johnny Greaseball do
7405000	7410840	you want to buy a bowling ball and like in almost invariably sometimes twice
7410840	7415440	sometimes he'd do it three times some every once in a while you'd get the
7415440	7420000	sense of like yeah this person needs another they need to mold this over but
7420000	7424880	most of the time it was like a watching a chiropractor on a caveman just go
7424880	7431480	crack like where you came in one way and he just would go you memorize this
7431480	7434400	monologue and they go do this and then you would go you would do it completely
7434400	7438360	differently and the room would be silent because you had nailed the Johnny
7438360	7443640	Greaseball monologue you were actor or not good actor bad actor who gives a
7443640	7450120	shit you were sitting in a chair and he was like you memorized it now say it like
7450120	7455080	you're trying to convince somebody if that's what the intention is it was like
7455080	7458960	you can walk out of there going holy shit he told a great story about Robert
7458960	7463280	Duvall who he worked on network with and I did one of Robert Duvall's
7463280	7468520	monologues from that where he's firing William Holden and I did it again and a
7468520	7472480	couple times and it went okay and I said when Robert Duvall did that like how
7472480	7478320	many takes was that was it like take ten and he goes he did it once it's like
7478320	7483080	that's how good Robert Duvall was and and when he did was the Prophet was that
7483080	7489360	one called where he was fuck okay the Apostle thank you
7489360	7493120	somebody asked him an interview how do you how do you prepare for that like like
7493120	7497560	and he goes I I'm so good at this now doing it for so long I don't really have
7497560	7501400	to prepare I just learned the lines and I think of one thing it is a great thing
7501400	7505360	that Sam told me because I overcomplicate things he said yeah I walk
7505360	7509520	on the set and I just look I just find something and when I did that monologue
7509520	7514280	I looked up and I said wow there's a lot of lights up there it sounds like
7514280	7518280	cheating you're an actor and then he goes just one thing that makes you feel
7518280	7522360	like a human being like one thing that puts you in the present moment not your
7522360	7526600	your preparation or anything it's oh geez oh look at all these lights and then he
7526600	7530560	goes he goes I know the shit's there that's what Sam taught me is like you
7530560	7534600	have all of the emotions right there like just let them happen you can do
7534600	7538920	that and don't don't overthink things anyway we love you Sam shrob you've been
7538920	7546360	awful quiet yeah oh Jesus it's 10 10 I know we've gone I mean what Sam would
7546360	7550680	not but want to be remembered Rob extra-long I can't you do you want to put
7550680	7559800	a little punctuation on the show I can earn your time no I mean I've been
7559800	7566680	quiet along because I mean Sam does mean like so much to me and prove it and it's
7566800	7573360	it's hard to not talk to him about him without getting choked up so it's so
7573360	7582800	that's why I've been quiet but no Sam Sam taught me a lot about just believing
7582800	7590680	in myself and who I was and and just being happy in my own skin and that's it
