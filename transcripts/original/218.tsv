0	16240	Welcome to Hollywood, California everybody, Harman Town is now in session.
16240	19200	The meltdown show is gone, but Harman Town persists.
19200	22200	Let's bring our Spencer Crittenden everybody.
22200	37200	And the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
37200	39200	Thank you.
39200	48200	Thank you very much.
48200	52200	You know there's warm up and then there's show stealing.
52200	57200	You might want to just cool it down a little bit.
57200	59200	What are you afraid of Dan?
59200	62200	Are you afraid that I will overshadow you with my pre-show antics?
62200	66200	Yeah, because they involve exercise and stuff.
66200	67200	What am I supposed to do?
67200	71200	That's why I do it pre-show so you don't have to get in a lather.
71200	78200	Yeah, but then it's like Jabba the Hutt following Luke Skywalker.
78200	80200	Did you see me chop that cigarette in half with a whip?
80200	85200	Yeah, you used the force, I'm so proud of you.
85200	93200	You should have your own trilogy of movies and I should just be a big fat thing at the beginning of the worst one.
93200	95200	We get it.
95200	97200	Are you going to freeze me in carbonite?
97200	99200	Just to be a dick?
99200	109200	And to create 40 years of awkward soaps and chocolates.
109200	111200	Wait, there's Han Solo frozen chocolates?
111200	112200	Oh yeah, man.
112200	114200	I shouldn't say awkward because I love them.
114200	119200	I have carbonite Han Solo ice trays.
119200	120200	For real?
120200	121200	Like little rubber things.
121200	125200	You can have Han Solo frozen and carbonite ice in your drink.
125200	130200	They melt so fast because of his little fingers.
130200	131200	It's not ideal.
131200	135200	Yeah, and there's soaps and chocolates and stuff.
135200	139200	Soaps is the way to go because you can just leave it out in ornamental Han Solo soap.
139200	143200	Han Solo.
143200	148200	You guys heard the name Katie May?
148200	151200	The unfortunate model actor.
151200	155200	And they just found out that she died mysteriously.
155200	156200	They traced it to...
156200	159200	She went to the chiropractor.
159200	161200	This is just my fucking...
161200	165200	Not to make her tragedy about me, but I was like...
165200	168200	But if you did, it would go a little something.
168200	176200	She went to the chiropractor and he just like adjusted her to the point where then she went home and just without realizing it kind of slowly died.
176200	180200	Like it pinched something that she must have just...
180200	186200	It sounds like an urban legend, but she just went home and was just laying there and must have been...
186200	191200	I mean, we don't know what happened in her final hours, but the cause of death was...
191200	194200	I'd never go into the chiropractor again.
194200	198200	My girlfriend has stiff neck issues and she always asks me to crack her back.
198200	201200	Am I going to kill her one day by doing it?
201200	202200	Okay.
202200	205200	So just another thing to worry about.
205200	207200	Just keep playing video games.
208200	212200	Let's convince her that it's really dangerous so I never have to do it again.
212200	215200	Speaking of safety...
215200	222200	And this is the reason why in the months ahead I'm struggling very hard to create a Graham Norton feedback loop.
222200	225200	I want this show to evolve to the point where you people...
225200	227200	What do you mean you people?
230200	234200	You white people is what I usually mean.
234200	239200	Can see what the people on the stream are seeing so that...
239200	243200	I'm not saying the goal is to become a real TV show for God's sake.
243200	245200	I mean, no, that'd be terrible.
245200	252200	But I'm just saying like you'll have a lot more fun because I can show you this Instagram of this lady.
252200	253200	Maybe you've seen it.
253200	255200	This is beautiful woman.
255200	257200	A beautiful specimen of humanity.
257200	259200	I don't mean physical.
259200	261200	Now what am I doing saying she's ugly?
262200	264200	Not my first choice.
264200	269200	I'm using beautiful in a spiritual way.
269200	271200	I'm saying this is amazing.
271200	272200	There's an Instagram.
272200	275200	Somebody took on a plane of a woman.
275200	277200	Kelly Oxford re-Instagrammed it.
277200	279200	I don't know where this source is from.
279200	283200	But it's this woman and she's sitting on an airplane and she's got the neck pillow.
283200	284200	So her head's propped up.
284200	287200	She's sound asleep and clipped to the neck pillow.
287200	289200	It kind of looks like a neck brace.
289200	290200	It's almost like she has whiplash.
290200	294200	It's like one of those pillows that's just holding her head perfectly still.
294200	301200	And clipped to the neck pillow is a laminated card.
301200	307200	Like a pristine, typographically graceful.
307200	311200	It's like the leading is perfect.
311200	313200	Like the kerning.
313200	317200	And it's laminated and it has a little clip on it.
317200	319200	It clips right to her neck pillow.
319200	321200	And I want to make sure I get it right.
321200	325200	Because she's a woman of exactitude who is...
325200	326200	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
326200	327200	Where is it?
327200	328200	Where is it?
328200	329200	Oh, here it is.
329200	332200	It says, please wake me for snacks and drinks.
332200	333200	Thank you.
335200	337200	And she's just sound asleep.
337200	338200	That's great.
338200	339200	And she...
339200	346200	It was amazing to me because the caption that sums up your visceral reaction immediately
346200	352200	is like some person responded immediately with like, this bitch is my hero.
354200	362200	Which kind of sums up the dichotomy because it's kind of like you're jolted by her having demands
362200	364200	and entitlement and all this stuff.
364200	366200	But she's managing all of it.
366200	368200	But that says so many things.
368200	370200	She travels a lot, first off.
370200	375200	And she also likes to get her little disease on the plane.
375200	378200	But also, don't call her late for dinner.
379200	380200	She wants a snack.
380200	385200	It's kind of amazing because you're so used to the dichotomy being, oh, there's people who are zen
385200	389200	who are in the moment and those are the good people and then there's the uptight schedule based people
389200	390200	and those are the bad people.
390200	393200	But no, nothing's ever that simple.
393200	397200	This is a person who clearly, she plans her shit out.
397200	399200	She has foresight.
399200	402200	But she's also at the same time kind of a life master.
403200	406200	There's a lot of zen people who are so fucking irritated.
406200	407200	I fly a lot.
407200	411200	Because they just use zen as an excuse to be flaky and fuck up your day, right?
411200	413200	I bet she's a really considerate house guest.
413200	416200	There's probably a really good chance that she's not...
416200	419200	She would leave you a note and probably give you a nice little gift when she left her place.
419200	423200	Yeah, she probably does her own dishes and all that shit.
423200	427200	It's just something about that because it's not like a shitty marker thing.
427200	433200	And also, she said, again, please, comma, wake me for snacks ampersand drinks.
433200	436200	She used an ampersand exclamation point.
436200	438200	Thank you, exclamation point.
438200	441200	I like that you started off by saying leading and kerning, by the way.
441200	442200	That shows off your...
442200	444200	But it's just like, she used it.
444200	447200	It's center justified.
447200	452200	It's not left justified, but it's also not like shitty fucking like block.
452200	453200	Can I see the photo?
453200	455200	I don't know that I have it.
455200	456200	I don't have it off hand.
456200	457200	I just like...
457200	458200	I'll track it down.
458200	463200	But like six months from now, I'll go zap and it'll be on the thing and America will be like, yay.
463200	467200	And then she'll be like, you owe me money and then we'll...
467200	470200	And then CBS will be like, we'd like to buy you.
470200	471200	And then we're like, yay.
471200	475200	And they're like, but she can't say anything bad about Jim Belushi.
475200	479200	What could you possibly say bad about Jim Belushi,
479200	484200	except for the fact that he pissed in the olive jar at the craft service in front of his co-stars?
485200	489200	I overheard a guy at dinner tonight who was...
489200	492200	I don't know if I can do this justice, but he was like,
492200	497200	there was a couple over at the other dinner table that we were eavesdropping on.
497200	499200	And the guy was going like...
499200	502200	He goes like, no, it's extreme Pilates.
502200	504200	You know, I've been doing Wonderbar.
504200	508200	Or she goes like, no, you know, I've been doing like Wonderbar for about three years.
508200	512200	And he goes like, well, yeah, but no, you've been doing this other thing.
512200	513200	And he was like correcting her.
513200	515200	And he's like, honey, I mean, no.
515200	520200	I'm telling you what you were doing was sitting upright in bed doing those things.
520200	521200	He's like explaining to her.
521200	523200	And then he goes like, I mean, now it's...
523200	525200	I'm telling you, now they have one down the street.
525200	527200	And I mean, now it's hardcore.
527200	528200	Now it's a legitimate workout.
528200	530200	I mean, before it was gay.
531200	533200	And then there was like a pause.
533200	534200	And then I heard him very quietly.
534200	536200	I was like, nah, I shouldn't say gay.
537200	540200	And I was like, well, either you should.
541200	542200	Either you're fine.
543200	546200	Like, I don't think anyone was going to like come over to the table and go, excuse me.
546200	547200	That's really offensive.
549200	550200	You know what I mean?
550200	552200	Because you sound super gay.
553200	556200	Like, it made me think like, are...
558200	562200	Is that when gay people...
568200	569200	Go on, Danny.
569200	570200	I forgot what they were.
571200	572200	You're doing great.
572200	573200	You're doing great.
573200	574200	Humans.
575200	577200	When gay folk...
578200	580200	That pause with me trying to...
580200	582200	Do I want to get specific gay men?
583200	585200	Gay people, do they...
585200	590200	Do they, in conversations with loved ones and or each other,
591200	595200	do they police each other on the use of gay to be a derogatory...
595200	597200	To be like kind of like using it, you know?
597200	598200	I don't know.
598200	601200	And also, this guy, I also took that to mean...
601200	603200	I was like, oh, this guy, he's straight.
603200	606200	But like, boy, he's got a...
608200	611200	He's worrying about something he does not have to worry about.
611200	615200	Like, because he's like ostensibly the reason you're like backpedaling on that is like,
615200	616200	oh, I shouldn't say gay.
616200	620200	Like the unspoken part of that is I shouldn't say that because someone...
620200	621200	Might get the wrong idea.
621200	624200	Someone walking around here might get offended.
624200	626200	And it's like, no one's going to get offended.
626200	629200	You sound gayer than the Statue of Liberty.
629200	630200	Okay.
631200	633200	Like everyone would just be like...
633200	635200	One of the most famous gay icons.
638200	644200	Like Nathan Lane could be walking his seven chihuahuas by and overhear you
644200	646200	and he'd say, way to take it back, you know?
646200	647200	That's all.
648200	650200	You have nothing to worry about, sir.
651200	655200	Man eating the arugula salad at Little Dom's.
655200	658200	Did you just out the Statue of Liberty?
659200	661200	Come on. She's... Look at her. Come on.
662200	665200	She's always hanging out with a Staten Island fairy.
665200	668200	Hello! Hello!
668200	671200	Hello! Joke from 1983.
672200	675200	She's French. She's carrying a book.
677200	679200	She's holding a torch.
680200	681200	For some fucking lady.
681200	683200	Yeah. For some chick.
683200	685200	All right. So I think that's enough.
687200	689200	That's enough of my business.
691200	695200	Our guest tonight is another podcasting hero.
695200	699200	The reason I'm familiar with this podcast, I just became familiar with it,
699200	706200	is because my girlfriend Cody, her mom, Randy, mama LaRusso from Karate Kid.
706200	709200	His girlfriend's mom is the mom from Karate Kid.
711200	716200	That's never going to stop being the coolest fucking thing I've ever heard of.
716200	719200	She also played Rizzo on Broadway and Grease.
719200	721200	Yeah. She's a fucking mate.
721200	723200	But she'll always be mama LaRusso to me.
724200	728200	But like a lot of people, actually, she was on Mad Men as the...
728200	731200	I can't remember the character's name, but she was just... Whatever.
731200	733200	It doesn't matter. It's not about her.
734200	735200	You haven't even said hi to Spencer.
735200	738200	You're going to bring in a guest and you haven't even addressed Spencer.
739200	743200	You know the tradition of addressing Spencer before you bring out the guest.
743200	745200	Yeah. It's bad luck.
745200	746200	It's a severe...
746200	747200	Spencer, how are you?
747200	749200	Oh, I'm so good, you guys.
749200	752200	Now he's just using this as a time to pour himself a drink.
752200	753200	Oh, man.
753200	755200	Wow. Nimble is a mountain ghost.
757200	759200	It's in the way that she uses it.
768200	769200	Oh.
777200	778200	Dude!
782200	785200	That's a real... That's a real weapon.
786200	787200	Yeah, those...
788200	789200	What is happening?
789200	791200	People are wielding things.
791200	801200	What are we looking at precisely here?
802200	803200	That is horrifying.
804200	805200	Exactly.
806200	811200	Eli Roth is here tonight with a prop from his next movie.
812200	813200	You want to try it?
813200	815200	No, no. Come on. Let's not devolve.
815200	816200	No!
818200	820200	What is this? This is just...
820200	821200	Let's just keep it.
822200	823200	That's your second.
823200	824200	This is my scepter.
826200	827200	It's a weird...
827200	828200	He had a mess.
828200	829200	What is it made of?
829200	830200	It looks like it's wax.
830200	831200	Is this wax?
831200	832200	It's a...
832200	833200	Resin?
833200	839200	It's an elm stick from Sedona covered in wax from my house.
841200	842200	Would you like to come up here?
842200	843200	House wax.
843200	844200	Just one second.
848200	849200	I've got scepter questions.
850200	864200	What in the Joshua Tree is going down?
867200	869200	The audience is in an uproar right now.
870200	875200	For the listener who's not live streaming this one, you're wearing...
876200	879200	Is it like a bathrobe? What do you have on it?
880200	882200	I prefer to call it my prophetic mantle.
883200	884200	Prophetic mantle?
884200	885200	Yes.
885200	886200	That's what I prefer to call it from now on.
886200	887200	I love that.
887200	889200	And you have a smart satchel with you?
889200	890200	Kind of a tote?
890200	893200	A bit of a Masonic apron bag.
895200	896200	Okay.
896200	898200	And you have Morgan Mindy headband on.
898200	899200	That's right.
900200	901200	It says...
901200	903200	It says gay in the back.
903200	906200	It says gay in the back, but business is right.
906200	911200	It's an election thing.
911200	912200	I'm with her.
913200	914200	Gay in the back.
916200	917200	Voting lever in the front.
917200	918200	That's right.
920200	921200	What's your name?
921200	922200	Joey.
922200	923200	Joey.
923200	924200	Yep.
924200	925200	And you're from...
925200	926200	Provo.
927200	928200	Provo, Utah.
928200	929200	Provo, Utah.
929200	930200	Yep.
931200	933200	And you're just visiting California?
933200	934200	Yes.
934200	941200	I have my brother and his partner, the spouse, and yeah, we're visiting.
941200	942200	Okay.
942200	943200	Well, you guys all came together.
943200	944200	You're not visiting them.
944200	945200	That's right.
945200	946200	We're from Utah.
946200	947200	What are you doing?
947200	948200	What else are you doing?
948200	954200	In Utah, I promote myself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith.
956200	959200	Which has a built-in audience there.
963200	965200	And you just do what you...
965200	966200	Wait, but that didn't answer my...
966200	967200	No.
968200	969200	Is that what you're doing here?
969200	970200	Are you kind of on a pilgrimage?
970200	971200	A missionary?
971200	972200	Or a mission?
972200	973200	A mission?
973200	974200	Right.
974200	979200	Well, so I was here on the 200th episode recording of your podcast, and it was amazing.
979200	980200	Thank you.
980200	981200	And I don't know...
981200	986200	It was after the show, so I don't know if you remember, but I actually gave you a hat
986200	991200	that my brother and his spouse and I actually stenciled the name.
991200	992200	Ernest Hemingway?
992200	993200	That's right.
993200	994200	I have that in my closet.
994200	995200	Oh, yeah.
995200	999200	And I regularly look at it and go, what the fuck is this?
999200	1000200	Yes.
1000200	1001200	I was just...
1001200	1002200	Cody had just...
1002200	1003200	And I were just looking at that.
1003200	1005200	And she said, it's cool.
1005200	1007200	She was about to wear it, and I was like, don't wear that.
1007200	1008200	What is that?
1008200	1009200	No.
1009200	1012200	There's another hat for her.
1012200	1019200	But I also gave one to Spencer, and it said Waldo Pierce.
1019200	1021200	And then you got one that said Ezra Pound.
1021200	1022200	Yes.
1022200	1023200	Yes.
1023200	1024200	So I just...
1024200	1025200	You had been talking a lot...
1025200	1028200	How did we all forget you?
1028200	1030200	Only in Los Angeles.
1030200	1033200	The most specific person in the world.
1033200	1035200	Got to work harder than this, folks.
1035200	1036200	Good luck.
1036200	1037200	I'll do what I can.
1037200	1044200	I mean, I've written to so many guys wearing daycoats that pretend to be Mormon prophets.
1044200	1049200	Well, the truth is he does kind of blend around here, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
1050200	1052200	Bad thing for your publicist, good thing for society.
1052200	1053200	Yeah.
1053200	1056200	It definitely stands out in Provo, not so much in LA.
1056200	1059200	What do you got in your Masonic satchel there?
1059200	1063200	Well, this is a medic droid for my nephew.
1063200	1064200	Okay.
1064200	1065200	Is that IG-88?
1065200	1066200	What is it?
1066200	1067200	What do you say?
1067200	1068200	Medic droid.
1068200	1069200	That's the only one I remember.
1069200	1070200	Oh, yeah.
1070200	1071200	That's some new crap.
1071200	1072200	He's like a no face.
1072200	1073200	And...
1073200	1076200	I want to see some shamanic shit in there.
1076200	1079200	I want to see, like, you have some sort of runestones or something.
1079200	1080200	What?
1080200	1081200	Uh-oh.
1081200	1082200	Oh, shit.
1082200	1083200	Okay.
1083200	1084200	Put that away.
1084200	1085200	Put that away.
1085200	1086200	Yeah.
1086200	1087200	All right.
1087200	1098200	Well, we also have our guest who must have the guest equivalent of blue balls right now.
1098200	1099200	We can handle...
1099200	1100200	I think Joey can...
1100200	1102200	You want to linger for a bit, Joey?
1102200	1103200	Sure.
1103200	1104200	I like your silence.
1104200	1105200	See how it happens.
1105200	1112200	Joey, you remind me of early Harmon Town days when we kept just discovering, like, Levi's
1112200	1114200	and Pimp People.
1114200	1117200	We had BJ Avril.
1117200	1120200	We had this great cast of grooviness.
1120200	1124200	Well, I'm a Facebook friend of Earthshine Jane.
1124200	1127200	I'm drinking out of her glass right now.
1127200	1128200	There you go.
1128200	1133200	And we're going to be interviewing her on our own podcast, The Pulpit, in a few days when
1133200	1134200	she visits Utah.
1134200	1135200	All right.
1135200	1139200	Now, when you say that you bill yourself as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith, is that
1139200	1140200	for real?
1140200	1143200	Like, you actually go around, like, spreading the good word as a letter?
1143200	1144200	Oh, that's very real.
1144200	1145200	Yes.
1145200	1146200	Yeah?
1146200	1147200	Well, so...
1147200	1154040	And not to frustrate your distinguished guests any longer, but...
1154040	1155200	He is extinguished at this point.
1155200	1159200	That's the problem now.
1159200	1164560	But I do circulate the past lives of certain individuals.
1164560	1173440	So you three individuals were friends during the lifetime of Waldo Pierce Ezra Pound, Ernest
1173440	1179800	Hemingway, and were part of that lost generation that kind of, you know, went to France and
1179800	1183120	had some fun, and you killed yourself.
1183120	1184120	So...
1184120	1185120	Spoilers.
1186040	1196080	And you had wanted to know a lot about the simulation during the 200th episode, so that's
1196080	1204280	why I went to kind of let you know how the data conservation works in this simulation,
1204280	1205520	where we just recycle your...
1205520	1206520	Oh, it's using...
1206520	1207520	Yeah, that would make sense.
1207520	1213280	Like, in video games, it's like, oh, that's clearly that other character with a hat.
1213280	1214280	Right.
1214280	1218000	It's like, yeah, that makes sense.
1218000	1219000	Of course.
1219000	1220000	All right.
1220000	1222240	Joey, how many times have you been to Hermitown?
1222240	1223240	Just twice now?
1223240	1224240	This is the second.
1224240	1225240	All right.
1225240	1226240	This is the second.
1226240	1227240	The first time was EP...
1227240	1228240	He gave us...
1228240	1229240	Hats.
1229240	1230240	Warnings we did not heed.
1230240	1233960	But now it's back to wonder why...
1233960	1238760	Now he has a fantastical rainbow schlong stick, which I'm really sure if you drop this
1238760	1242320	and turns into a snake, right?
1242320	1246640	A waxy, creepy snake.
1246640	1252480	Just to be clear, because you said this is a stick from your home, or no, not from your
1252480	1253480	home.
1253480	1254480	Sedoma.
1254480	1255480	Sedona.
1255480	1256480	Arizona.
1256480	1257480	Arizona.
1257480	1258480	Don't forget Sedona.
1258480	1259480	The land of sticks.
1259480	1260480	No, don't forget Winona.
1260480	1261960	And wax from your house.
1261960	1262960	That's right.
1262960	1263960	All right.
1263960	1264960	Wait.
1264960	1267880	So you have your own wax supply at home?
1267960	1268960	I do.
1270960	1271960	All right.
1271960	1275720	Well, so anyways, so this amazing podcast that we started listening to, to help put
1275720	1281680	us to sleep, the conceit of the podcast is a sincere attempt to put you to sleep.
1281680	1288080	It's for Insomniacs, it claims on the surface, but it's endlessly entertaining as well.
1288080	1289560	There's no wrong way to use it.
1289560	1290600	He goes into all that stuff.
1290600	1293840	It's very, very smart, amazing guy.
1293840	1297640	Please listen to his podcast, Sleep With Me, if you haven't already.
1297640	1298640	We'll hear this.
1298640	1301680	But let's get to know our new friend, Drew Ackerman.
1301680	1316120	Oh, well, that's, yeah, okay, that's nice.
1316120	1317120	Thank you.
1317120	1318120	All right.
1318120	1319120	Good move.
1319120	1320120	Hello, Drew.
1320120	1321120	Drew, meet Joey.
1321120	1322120	Hi.
1322120	1323120	Hey, what's up?
1323120	1324120	Drew, do you have any past life info on me?
1324120	1325120	I don't know.
1325120	1326120	Do I want to know?
1326120	1327120	I got my tarot cards.
1328080	1329080	Okay, great.
1329080	1330080	Oh, shit.
1330080	1336240	Wait, I said you have shamanic shit, you're hiding tarot cards in your satchel?
1336240	1337240	Are you going to do a reading right now?
1337240	1340240	Well, no, I'll just, I'll just be good.
1340240	1346760	Yeah, do a little background tarot on us and whenever you feel like something significant
1346760	1347760	pops up.
1347760	1348760	That's right.
1348760	1349760	Okay.
1349760	1350760	All right.
1350760	1351760	Right there on the phone.
1351760	1352760	All right.
1352760	1353760	Fine.
1354760	1359600	Will you let me know when, you know, wait, you already did let me know?
1359600	1360600	Does that mean she's here?
1360600	1361600	Yeah.
1361600	1362600	Oh, she's here.
1362600	1363600	Okay.
1363600	1364600	Well, she's on the schedule too.
1364600	1365600	Let's hear it for Drew.
1365600	1366600	Thanks for coming, Drew.
1366600	1367600	Thank you.
1367600	1371600	Would you, would you mind terribly?
1371600	1375200	Let's do this Halloween intervention right now.
1375200	1379520	Doing the, because she, I begged her to come down and she's, she had food simmering on
1379520	1380520	the stove.
1380760	1385080	I just want to bring her out to, to, to go over a little, a little kerfuffle we had in
1385080	1386080	text.
1386080	1394160	Uh, uh, you remember our friend, uh, my neighbor, Beth boots in boots and pants and boots and
1394160	1406120	pants and boots and pants and boots and pants and boots and pants and boots and all right.
1406120	1409880	This is, this show is a, this shows is a cavalcade of stars.
1410880	1412960	I'll lay that staff across there.
1412960	1413960	All right.
1413960	1414960	Beth, thank you so much for coming down.
1414960	1418240	I know it was like, like I, you know, you, you sped out of your house.
1418240	1423320	I invited you last minute because I thought, well, geez, we had this thing.
1423320	1424320	It was a flare up.
1424320	1425320	It was a neighborly flare up.
1425320	1426320	All right.
1426320	1431760	And then I'm scrolling back in our conversation.
1431760	1432760	Okay.
1432760	1434360	And it's easy because you marked it with that photo.
1434360	1435360	All right.
1435360	1439560	So Beth, as you know, she came on the show with her, uh, son Timmer.
1439920	1442760	Uh, who was doing the, uh, haunted house.
1442760	1448800	And then Timmer, the son came on again last week with spooky, spooky one direction haunted
1448800	1449800	house.
1449800	1450800	Yes.
1450800	1451800	Yes.
1451800	1458280	So the following day, Monday, 10, 11 AM, uh, I get, so what do we want to do?
1458280	1465560	Do we want to, uh, do it last time we, I read your parts and you read my parts, but maybe
1465560	1466560	why don't we just,
1466560	1472240	I think it's actually based on all your language, maybe it's better if you just read your own.
1472240	1473240	I'll read my own.
1473240	1474240	All right.
1474240	1475240	Beth, I can't see.
1475240	1476240	Are you in a mic?
1476240	1477240	Do you have a microphone?
1477240	1478240	Yeah, I'll do it right.
1478240	1479240	Yeah.
1479240	1480240	Yeah.
1480240	1481240	Eat that mic.
1481240	1482240	Okay.
1482240	1483240	So I'm in there Monday.
1483240	1486080	So then this happened and I'm just, you know, I don't want to take up too much of Beth's
1486080	1490000	time, but I also didn't want to, I don't want to talk about this and like, I don't even
1490000	1491000	know what happened.
1491000	1495560	Well, it's like, like, like, so I guess we just start, we can just start.
1495560	1505960	So the, the last Sunday my son and his friends came on and his friends were wearing gas masks
1505960	1510200	and he came on to tell you about his haunted maze.
1510200	1517200	So the next morning I text Dan and I said, hi, Dan, last night we got a visit.
1517200	1520120	We believe it was from one of your diehard fans.
1520120	1525680	Whoever it was stole Timor's apocalyptic wasteland banner off of our garage door.
1525680	1529640	And then she sends a picture of the, of the, of the banner.
1529640	1533400	Let me see if I can show.
1533400	1536720	Oh, now what evidence did you have?
1536720	1537720	Yeah.
1537720	1547240	So I'll handle this for a 45 minute fucking fight because I have, I have minor justice
1547240	1548240	issues.
1548240	1549360	Huge justice issues.
1549360	1552040	So let's see what goes down there.
1552040	1556920	I have medium justice issues for like the bears.
1556920	1557920	Yes.
1557920	1561920	And then Spencer, your justice issues are just right.
1561920	1562920	Yeah.
1562920	1563920	All right.
1563920	1573320	So, so I wrote, I sent this to Dan and then I said, the price of knowing Dan Harmon.
1573320	1578760	And I put a very surprised look of, uh, those little, uh, what do you call them?
1578760	1587000	Mo cheese, a sticker and, and, and then I wrote it again by accident and I said, oops.
1587000	1588000	Okay.
1588000	1592160	So, and then I put girl, this sounds like you had a little wine.
1592160	1593160	Okay.
1593160	1596600	These are wine texts.
1596600	1597680	All right.
1597680	1602600	So then I said, why on earth would you assume an adult podcast listener would do something
1602600	1605240	like that instead of a high school student?
1605240	1609840	And then I wrote back, I said, why would a high school student even want it so bad that
1609840	1611120	they would steal it?
1611120	1614560	It has more value to the person who has something that's connected to you.
1614560	1617240	A little piece of Dan Harmon.
1617240	1624040	That's a stretch.
1624040	1625680	They know my house is next door.
1625680	1628200	If they wanted a piece of me, they could take something from me.
1628200	1632420	My audience is nice people that it makes for a great story.
1632420	1635980	We will put everything away in our garage now.
1635980	1639460	They wouldn't be going to your haunted house to do anything but support you.
1639460	1641940	Some of your fans are nice, normal people.
1641940	1644940	Some of them are obsessed with Dan Harmon.
1644940	1645940	People.
1645940	1646940	It's true.
1646940	1650300	Your fans are fascinated that we live next door to you.
1650300	1651300	It's okay.
1651300	1652300	I'm not mad at you.
1652300	1653540	We'll just make a new one.
1653540	1656780	How could we possibly know if it is a Dan Harmon fan?
1656780	1658500	We just had a suspicion.
1658500	1663260	The boys are already excited to make a new one, and they've got a great story.
1663260	1666660	You may not be mad at me, but I can't think of a reason to share that suspicion with me
1666660	1676900	other than to solicit feelings of guilt.
1676900	1678420	Not to make you feel guilty.
1678420	1679860	It's not your fault.
1679860	1681580	It's more a story of interest.
1681580	1683380	Don't you find it interesting?
1683380	1687740	Would you want me to express shame or remorse about this thing just because you have a weird
1687740	1690500	theory connecting it to me?
1690500	1693960	What if my dog got poisoned and I texted you saying I knew your friends did it?
1693960	1698300	That would be really thoughtless of me, because if I respected you as a human being, I'd have
1698300	1702220	to know laying something like that near you would cause you anxiety.
1702220	1703380	It's funny.
1703380	1706420	We're rather humored about it, flattered in a way.
1706420	1710140	Saying you're humored and flattered that one of my fans stole your stuff is still saying
1710140	1712500	one of my fans stole your stuff.
1712500	1714580	It's weird to say that.
1714580	1716820	We don't know if it was one of your fans.
1716820	1719220	You don't know either.
1719220	1720220	So drunk.
1720220	1727620	You could smell the Chardonnay on these texts.
1727620	1729820	This is 10 a.m. though.
1729820	1730820	No judgment.
1730820	1731820	Notwithstanding.
1731820	1734180	We'll never really know.
1734180	1735540	It's just a suspicion.
1735540	1736940	We're not blaming you.
1736940	1738540	It's just a possibility.
1738540	1741100	We still love you, no matter what.
1741100	1745100	Think how cool it would be to have the banner on one's wall and be able to say that it came
1745100	1747940	from one of Dan Harmon's episodes.
1747940	1749460	Maybe it was a prankster.
1749460	1750960	Just was a coincidence.
1750960	1756260	You don't have fans that are a little out there?
1756260	1760420	Well I do have a crazy neighbor that accuses strangers of stealing shit, but I don't know
1760420	1768260	if she's a fan or not.
1768260	1769500	I didn't accuse you.
1769500	1770820	I said strangers.
1770820	1772500	I didn't accuse a stranger.
1772500	1774020	I suspected.
1774020	1775180	Don't really know.
1775180	1776860	Thought it was a possibility.
1776860	1778820	Thought it was a coincidence.
1778820	1780220	Thought it was interesting.
1780220	1782180	It's a possibility that ISIS took it.
1782180	1784700	You didn't text the president.
1784700	1788340	And it wouldn't be coincidence if a random, unknown, unrelated person took something from
1788340	1790140	a haunted house that was open to the public.
1790140	1792460	It would be incidents.
1792460	1796500	If I thought that someone would do that to you guys that respected my show, I'd be livid
1796500	1800340	and embarrassed.
1800340	1805820	I have a neighbor sharing information with a neighbor who just happened to have an episode
1805820	1811940	on his podcast relating to a neighbor's haunted maze the very same night the banner goes missing.
1811940	1813540	It's just a coincidence.
1813540	1817120	There's a cardboard sign on the street corner that says haunted house.
1817120	1819300	Has nobody been coming other than podcast people?
1819300	1822060	Do they have podcast logos on their foreheads?
1822060	1825820	Is there a sign in sheet and all the people that came wrote, Harmontown in the who sent
1825820	1829660	you column?
1829660	1830980	You are livid.
1830980	1833740	You take responsibility for all your fans.
1833740	1836280	You know that none of them would ever do that.
1836280	1838900	You know that none of them would even consider that.
1838900	1840900	Do you consider them your children?
1840900	1845780	Have I offended you because I said that it is a possibility that one of your fans may
1845780	1847740	have taken it?
1847740	1849900	Yes!
1849900	1851500	You have.
1851500	1853540	It's an offensive thing to do.
1853540	1858700	Look up the word offense.
1858700	1860660	I did not accuse you.
1860660	1862380	This is not about you.
1862380	1863980	Why are you taking this so personally?
1863980	1866300	This has nothing to do with you.
1866300	1868340	I'm not blaming you.
1868340	1872540	Why did you text me about it?
1872540	1877100	Because I had suspicions that it could possibly be one of your fans.
1877100	1879700	So it has something to do with me.
1879700	1882700	No it doesn't.
1882700	1889260	So you expected me to laugh and say ha ha that's funny that someone in my podcast audience
1889260	1891500	stole your property.
1891500	1896260	You joked about two episodes ago that you were afraid that if you gave our address away
1896260	1900940	that everyone would know whereabouts you live and that you would come home to find a stranger
1900940	1901940	in your kitchen.
1901940	1903900	I would be upset for you if that happened.
1903900	1908580	I wouldn't consider it a normal human response to be amused by Timmer's property being stolen
1908580	1910660	even if it was by a complete random person.
1910660	1912220	I would just say oh that's too bad.
1912220	1914140	I wouldn't say ha ha that's funny.
1914140	1918480	So imagine how much weirder it would be to say ha ha to someone stealing Timmer's stuff
1918480	1921780	if it wasn't a complete random person but was someone somehow doing it because of my
1921780	1922780	show.
1922780	1925700	The normal human response to the idea of that would be for me to say oh god that's fucking
1925700	1926700	awful.
1926700	1927700	I can't believe someone did that.
1927700	1931260	I'm so sorry.
1931260	1933220	I didn't expect you to laugh.
1933220	1935500	I didn't expect you to get mad though.
1935500	1937100	I was making a joke.
1937100	1942580	You didn't find it funny but it really was an attempt of light humor that was taken very
1942580	1943580	seriously.
1943580	1944580	Sorry.
1944580	1947860	Thank you for being such a cool neighbor.
1947860	1961580	You take the high road and I'll take the low road and I'll be in Scotland before.
1961580	1965620	People always want to hear about what it's like to live next to Dan Harmon.
1965620	1967300	A peek into him.
1967300	1970940	Well your joke was that your son had to pay a price for living next door to me.
1970940	1972700	That would be something that I would feel terrible about.
1972700	1975580	And you kind of committed to the joke to the point of arguing for a really long time that
1975580	1977920	we should definitely assume someone that listens to the show did it.
1977920	1979620	It wasn't very clear and still isn't.
1979620	1980620	Which part is the joke?
1980620	1983100	Do you still honestly believe it's more likely that someone from my audience did it and the
1983100	1984580	joke was that it mattered at all?
1984580	1987060	Or was the joke that you suspected it was someone from the audience and you just have
1987060	1994180	a very strong commitment to humor?
1994180	1999340	Dan can we take that one again but faster this time?
1999340	2001900	Oh Dan it was a stupid joke.
2001900	2009060	I'm not that mad.
2009060	2010060	Sent with balloons.
2010060	2012020	But I have to fixate on my writing now.
2012020	2015060	I'm way past a morning deadline and getting yelled at.
2015060	2016060	Please forgive me.
2016060	2018380	I forgive you nutty pants.
2018380	2020500	No harm intended.
2020500	2024980	Hashtag neighbors for life.
2024980	2032940	That's a good ending.
2032940	2038780	I like the new hashtag harm intended.
2038780	2044140	And then I sent him an emoji that is the emoji where the guy's eyes are googling like this
2044140	2048860	and he's the crazy guy.
2048860	2050860	No I'm not saying that you're nuts.
2050860	2052740	I said well maybe just a little.
2052740	2053740	All right.
2053740	2054740	Well I guess.
2054740	2055740	All right.
2055740	2062780	So is there you have the pulpit of do you want do you still think that we can still
2062780	2063780	be friends?
2063780	2066540	Well do you still think one of my fans took your tarp?
2066540	2070140	I took the fucking tarp.
2070140	2072020	It's in my car.
2072020	2076020	I knew it.
2076020	2077020	Well I.
2077020	2078020	Who won the tarp?
2078020	2081580	I used to steal anything that wasn't nailed down.
2081580	2082580	Maybe I.
2082580	2086260	But it's got to be a teenager unrelated to the show.
2086260	2095380	This had black gorilla tape that it was taped all through the garage and it was very very
2095380	2101180	it looked like a little kid that had taped it to the garage.
2101180	2107220	And it was big and it was it just I just think it's kind of a really really weird
2107220	2116220	coincidence that hold on that the night that oh wait don't get mad all over again.
2116220	2121580	Let me ask you guys because you're his fans.
2121580	2130940	Is it a strong coincidence that that it could be I'm not saying it's you I'm not saying
2131700	2132700	it's you.
2132700	2136900	I'm sure most of you are very normal nice people.
2136900	2139820	I'm sure some of you are nice people but a lot of you are bringing crime.
2139820	2140820	Yes.
2140820	2141820	A lot of you are rapists.
2141820	2142820	Is that a possibility.
2142820	2148740	I'm sure some of you are nice some of you are stealing signs.
2148740	2158060	Is it a possibility that one of you could have driven to our house because we live next
2158060	2159620	door to Dan Harmon.
2159620	2163060	I think it's as likely that you stole this sign yourself so you could get back on the
2163060	2165060	show.
2165060	2170180	There's there's anything's possible.
2170180	2172460	There's no need to focus in on the possibility.
2172460	2179220	I just think it's very very coincidental that the next morning that you know we had that
2179220	2185420	episode the net night before but but nobody would have a day night that this happened
2185420	2189540	it happened when we when we went outside Monday morning.
2189540	2190540	Okay.
2190540	2194060	Monday morning so it would have to be so they would have to be here in the or live streaming
2194060	2201980	person that that was nearby that somebody you know whatever it was somebody you know
2201980	2213780	somebody one of you yeah well we'll continue to I mean I thought we'll lower the lights
2213780	2214780	and turn our backs.
2214780	2225540	If you took the apocalypse sign put it put it yeah yeah right yeah yeah I mean well yeah
2225540	2230780	if someone someone someone return you can you can you can just bring it to nerd mount
2230780	2236300	right yeah bring it here here's a way to do it if you return the sign and you were a harm
2236300	2241460	in town family you're listening to this right now and you did take it return is really cool
2241460	2249620	if you did yeah that's like really like it's a very very cool banner to hang on a wall
2249620	2254260	Beth boots and somebody could say would you put a hundred dollar bounty on that if someone
2254260	2257700	could prove that they were a harm in town fan would you pay a hundred dollars to get
2257700	2264020	that sign back would I pay yes yes to prove yourself right you know what I think Dan Harmon
2264020	2272660	whoa oh would pay a hundred dollars but then if you took it you can just make no I would
2272660	2278500	not I didn't take it well I didn't take it but Dan Harmon I think you both have to you
2278500	2283380	have to match Dan's 100 you both have to put a hundred two hundred clams if you're a harmonian
2283380	2288100	that stole that sign wait wait wait wait wait you Beth are wait you're putting up a hundred
2288180	2293300	I would be right so right you'd be right I would be right but it would cost you a hundred
2293300	2301700	simoleons no you would be wrong right I'd be wrong yes yeah so the the penalty for being wrong
2301700	2306100	is that you have to pay a hundred dollars right what we're saying is
2309460	2316100	well let me wait wait wait let me up the ante okay let me up the anti physical challenge if we
2316180	2323620	were to get that it's gonna get a banner back you have to pay the hundred dollars and then autograph
2323620	2332900	it for the person and then it would be worth even more she's still hang it on their wall
2332900	2338580	Beth you stole the banner you just want this is the fucking longest con I've ever seen this is
2338580	2343220	like the stings are you acting out against the haunted house no I'm Robert Redford's about to
2343300	2350020	come out I think this is a funny story and wouldn't it be interesting to find out who's right
2350020	2356820	great but we won't be able to what we only thing we really can do is say if somebody gives it back
2356820	2362660	anonymously we can we'll still won't be able to reach the conclusion you know automatically that
2362660	2367380	a harm in town fan took it however that person has the power whoever took it has the power to
2367380	2373460	make it look that way and we're opening ourselves up and saying even like fine if that person does
2373460	2380500	that would you be willing to pay any money for that no no no no no let's look at if if it gets
2380500	2388500	returned I think Dan Harmon should autograph it and we can hang it here on the wall can I make a
2388580	2396340	pitch or ma'am make a pitch um I think anyone listening is right now should go to that haunted
2396340	2405460	maze steal anything you want Dan Harmon will autograph it for you well I'll make you this
2405460	2410660	deal now let's just go rob this fucking place starting starting with free harmony on this show
2411220	2416900	anything that gets stolen is kind of this podcast fault like like like like because I'm saying
2416980	2421860	harmony don't have the guts to go steal shit from the boots and family
2423300	2429780	uh for too long in our garage now but well okay but but anyways all right well so like you just
2429780	2435540	wait is it possible if you think of a scenario in which there's someone who is so driven by his
2435540	2441540	obsession with Dan that he wants to steal or she why do you think that person would go to you and
2441540	2447140	not go to Dan's house and steal for something from Dan's house it was it was the night of our
2447140	2452820	episode but that that and that's bad the way they look at it it's a really really cool banner
2452820	2460180	they could hang it on their wall that's like and that applies to anybody no it applies to only Dan
2460180	2467540	Harmon fans one of them one of them who would be cool to like wouldn't this be cool because I took
2468020	2472260	it and it was related to Dan Harmon because it was about the episode about
2472260	2477220	all right mazes well I feel like in this gamma versus mothra conflict that we have
2478020	2483860	like like you with the eucalyptus tree thing it was like okay I'm the bad person your tree is
2483860	2489540	fine by the way you're the bad person in this case it survived those wins oh yeah but you don't know
2489540	2494580	you could you could be a deceased eucalyptus tree and survive a million wins those trees are gone
2494580	2498500	yeah I well anyways but I do want to acknowledge like I texted you
2498500	2501620	and said will you come down and read this shit and that's like
2502660	2505780	you had soup on the stove and you were in your pajamas and you came down here
2505780	2512660	I'm still wearing my pajama top so uh thank you so much and we're gonna let's hear it for Beth
2512660	2524900	Butsen and Beth Butsen well don't forget to stop by the haunted maze just take every goddamn thing
2524900	2531300	you can get your hands on and I don't want to see a thing standing there and if you bring back that
2531300	2537220	that uh tarp tarp yeah yeah the banner uh Dan Harmon said he would sign it
2537220	2546260	and give you a hundred dollars so okay all right and if you don't bring it back Jeff will give you
2546260	2552900	a hundred dollars yes but I'm gonna sign Beth Butsen all right Beth Butsen
2558900	2564020	and the unsung hero of the of the Beth Butsen chronicles her husband Dan who I think drove her
2564020	2568740	drove her down here last minute probably back there too we've never even really met him thank
2568740	2572740	you Dan he was out here was out here once and he but he never spoke he just sat there uh
2572740	2580180	in blissful silence the long suffering boots and husband they call him on the block behind Beth's
2580180	2584980	back that's what we all call him oh the long suffering boots and husband again let's uh let's
2584980	2590340	take a bite of Drew Ackerman thanks for coming up Drew good to see you all right all right
2590420	2599700	Drew sorry I am so sorry I uh that was awesome okay uh had to had to it was a timely thing
2599700	2606420	I it wasn't though I'm a bad podcaster you're just being respectful of her time so your uh
2607220	2613940	your your podcast conceit which is sincere which I but I have to say like also doubles as like
2613940	2619460	genius comedy I mean it does like something about you that kind of in a sublime way rises
2619460	2625940	above the dichotomy of is he doing a bit or is he for real you're you're kind of both you know
2625940	2630900	how funny it is that you're for real about the fact that your dulcet tones your way of speaking
2631940	2636260	you have resigned yourself instead of sort of you know in a world where everyone's trying to
2636260	2642180	to uh you know uh distinguish themselves and entertain you were like you know what come to
2642180	2648500	me when you want to go to sleep yeah yeah like I mean like I think it's even as a person that makes
2648500	2653220	it like I look at it like oh I'm putting all this work into something that no one listens and I'm
2653220	2658420	like a really anxious obsessive person so I'm constantly worrying about it like oh this isn't
2658420	2664500	good enough and then I'm like holy shit like if someone like an outsider is watching this they'd
2664500	2668740	be like dude you're insane like and some listeners even email me like why don't you just read from
2668740	2672900	the phone book why do you spend so much time working on it like and I'm like well I'm convinced
2672900	2677860	that's what puts you to sleep yeah well that's yeah and that's that's there was an article in
2677860	2682820	the new yorker about you about your podcast that talked about that that insomnia is not
2682820	2687700	something that people have conquered it's a lot like the common cold it's it is it is you know
2687700	2692100	people think it's so simple but it it persists because doctors can't really get around it
2692100	2698340	because anything a doctor would prescribe to you it becomes part of this labyrinth of anxiety
2698340	2704500	that keeps people awake uh you yourself suffer from insomnia correct yeah yeah like I mean the
2704500	2707860	podcast it was funny because last sunday you were kind of talking about sunday nights
2708420	2713220	and you were having a shitty night and you're like oh like and for me that's where the podcast
2713220	2718500	came out it was like I had the terrible time at school and I would like when sundays were coming
2718500	2724260	I would not be able to sleep and I'd be like all worried and I was like oh I told my parents and
2724260	2728260	they're like drink some milk or like what you know whatever like and I'm like no you don't
2728260	2733940	understand I like spend the whole night worrying and moving and they're like oh and then I started
2733940	2740660	listening to dr Demento like weird ale and stuff and it didn't never put me to sleep but it like
2740660	2744660	took my mind off of like lying there and worrying and thinking about going to school the next day
2744660	2750020	and getting in trouble and stuff and and yeah I don't think like like pills can work for some
2750020	2753620	people like there's different things that work for different people but I think like a lot of
2753620	2758980	people want a bedtime story yeah now what do you do exactly what makes you think that you're so
2758980	2763460	narcotic that you can put people to sleep by talking like what is what is it about you that
2763700	2768580	also is it well is it verifiable that you that people have said thank you you knock me right out
2769220	2777540	yeah and yeah and your sponsors are mattresses and stuff yeah like like he and he has he has
2777540	2782740	I think you have about as many listeners maybe more than us I mean he's he's he's very humble
2782740	2787460	and self-effacing New Yorker never wrote shit about Harman town uh but the New Yorker the New
2787460	2794580	Yorker piece on you which was June 2016 but they they I copied and pasted this it said the ideal
2794580	2800900	bedtime story according to Natun Verma a national spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep
2800900	2808980	Medicine so the ideal bedtime story is one that doesn't build upon itself like a movie with a lot
2808980	2814020	of parallel stories that don't connect at the end uh which I thought was kind of interesting like
2814500	2818900	the children's books that our parents would would sit with us they do have a kind of like
2818900	2825140	meandering quality they don't exactly like they're not die hard they don't like yeah yeah like the
2825140	2831860	longer you're listening the bigger the build is oh my god Hans Gruber's gonna get it it's like oh
2831860	2839220	and then this and then my mother would always read Beowulf to me but but you when you first
2839220	2842740	started doing the podcast how many episodes have you done because you do about three a week yeah
2842740	2848500	like I've done like 450 like more than 450 how long have you been at it since what three years so
2848500	2853460	so he's been doing it less time than we've been doing this podcast and has twice as well this of
2853460	2861540	course the math would work out Dan he did yeah if you stacked his podcasts on top of ours there'd
2861540	2869140	be three times as many because he does them three times a week if the moon was one from the earth
2869220	2877700	he'd have hit it three times um thanks Dan uh the uh the but but you did you originally start
2877700	2881700	doing it I didn't like go back to the beginning did you start trying to just straight up tell
2881700	2886820	bedtime stories I like was like curious like I was like man like I don't know I liked listening
2886820	2891460	to podcasts and comedy podcasts and stuff and I was like man why and this isn't like a knock
2891460	2897300	on like guided meditations or nature sounds but it was always like something that like you're
2897460	2901300	I'm an irritable person so irritate me or the nature noises we get I'd be like wow
2902180	2908500	and I was like why isn't there something that's a little bit weird but that has a bedtime story
2908500	2914660	it's also like like a factor because you're such a smart funny guy the thing is like I'm sure uh
2914660	2922020	uh like nature those tapes like the people that tend to delve into that area they don't have
2922580	2927300	like god bless them but they don't they don't they're not like there's funny things that can
2927300	2930420	happen that they don't acknowledge they're not lying they're like thinking about like
2930420	2934340	what are the bugs crawling around like where the hell is this rain like shrapnel partner
2934340	2938580	shrapnel partner friend but he's a friend now it's just kind of it's more of a he's a kind of a
2938580	2945620	common life partner uh he he he tried to do like he had a therapist that would give make his own
2945620	2950340	tape he would give him tapes and sell them to him um this just happens at this point in the show
2950340	2957940	don't worry about it um but one of the things i remember shrub describing to me oh yeah i'm
2957940	2962020	listening to this tape and this guy's like talking to me about you know you're going to be uh less
2962020	2966500	intimidated uh in public you're going to he's giving issuing these commands but then like
2966500	2970820	clearly like a screen door opens and some woman comes home with groceries and like
2970820	2973940	like they said like these random sounds that happen uh
2979540	2984260	people people that put themselves in charge of of your spirit and your essence like the danger
2984260	2990100	there is that the drawstring is it's pulled so drawstring the bowstring is drawn so so tight
2990100	2996820	that the slightest bit of humanity like like shoots an arrow across the room is very distracting
2996900	3004660	you're from the outset the first episode that i listened to you do you just had decided that you
3004660	3009300	wanted to talk about well you didn't decide you got you talked about crackers for 30 minutes
3011940	3018500	30 30 hardcore like like like like crack like like just your the labyrinth of your mind i don't
3018500	3021860	say i don't think i would fall asleep to that i think i'd want to know no it's not allowed to
3021860	3026020	think about like you got like isn't there a cracker industry i mean that's what i was thinking about
3026020	3033620	like you got the green box crackers you got the red box crackers like what what other ones are
3033620	3039620	there uh you have a whole national biscuit company you got the nubiska yeah yeah but what did and
3039620	3044820	you got all of truck's followers i i was it it brought me to the edge of my consciousness
3044820	3048580	listening to the cracker thing and then what you really got into was that you were you'd become
3048580	3054420	obsessed with rick moranus and you you wanted to talk and i would i would drift in and out of
3054420	3060180	consciousness and when i would drift back into consciousness you were still in what apparently
3060180	3067380	was it was i guess a a fantasy improv that was a conversation between you and rick moranus
3068980	3074740	just for what seem it seemingly it seems like it's six hours like like like the the podcast are about
3074740	3080420	two hours long but it seems like that's the beautiful thing is like we use ocean waves and
3080420	3086020	howler monkeys and things that's true for somebody i don't suffer from insomnia i sleep
3086020	3091380	pretty well uh is this something that would put anyone to sleep or is it is it a certain mindset
3091380	3096020	that goes into this thinking like i need this particularly to knock me out like you would know
3096020	3101140	pretty quick like the people that it won't put to sleep hate me like they like email me they're
3101140	3106580	like i fucking hate your voice oh like so it's like pretty like because it is like damn insane
3106580	3111620	like some people certain things work for they like want to be led on this journey to find the
3111620	3115940	magical box within their soul or whatever but that's just not me like i want something that's
3115940	3122340	goofy do you ever slip in any words of bliminal stuff i guess like i've tried like i i tried a few
3122340	3128340	times yeah like in no way like the sad thing was no one emailed me like i was like okay my little
3128340	3135780	ninjas like i was pretending i was giving like a seminar on profiting from boredom or something
3135780	3141700	and then i was like okay now you're going to kill it you know i didn't i didn't say kill though
3141700	3146820	like how did you how did you describe yourself when you were like in the the the episode you
3146820	3150820	just did that people if people listen right now to the latest episode you talk about
3150820	3155540	you're nervous coming out of the podcast and you try to do my story circle model with the thing
3155540	3160260	it makes me feel like i ruined your podcast because you're you're talking about my bullshit
3160340	3165700	all night and it's like like like i but that was it was also brilliant i mean you were you
3165700	3171780	i'm sure lots of people fell asleep to that damn yeah i i no i don't fly myself that way but um
3171780	3177860	the you taught in that episode you said uh you just sometimes you're explaining you each week
3177860	3182820	each each podcast episode you're explaining to people who might be new you're going like uh
3182820	3187620	you know you're telling them how to categorize you and this episode you said something like
3187620	3193540	i'm just that friend of yours that uh you know you think uh yeah you know it's yeah i mean i'm
3193540	3198980	your friend that you're allowed to think is a is a is a doofus what did you say like something like
3198980	3204020	that like it like i mean that's like kind of the conceit of the podcast is like i mean via
3204020	3208580	podcasts like i'm coming over to your house but you have no commitment to like listen to me
3208580	3214980	or humor me or offer me a drink i mean like like almost like a super stone person that
3214980	3218580	doesn't that won't stop talking but instead of like getting on your nerves you're like
3218580	3221940	oh i'm just gonna lie here and fall asleep and they're like totally i don't care at all
3224420	3228180	let me tell you about the time i showed up at rick moranus's house and tried to pitch him to
3228180	3232340	get back you know i might have mentioned this a long time a long time ago in harmontown but i
3232340	3237540	was on a on a flight and alec baldwin this is a long time ago like pre-30 rock uh was sitting
3237540	3241940	across the aisle from me and he was sitting next to a woman who i don't think he knew and i had
3241940	3247460	the bows like noise canceling headset on so i could just barely hear him and it was the greatest
3247460	3254180	thing to fall asleep it was like you know when i was six i had this dog this dog ran away he
3254180	3258100	told the story about this dog that ran away i was like i just drifted beautifully off to say like
3258100	3263220	i want alec baldwin just to come over and just lay next to me and whisper yeah like i'm like
3263220	3270260	kind of like the uh the boring crappy version of alec baldwin but like also weirder and like i
3270260	3273780	try to stay calm i think that's another thing about the podcast is like i tend to be really
3274340	3280340	anxious and spastic but like to do the show i've got to be like i got to calm down and be like uh
3280340	3287060	well one i can't believe mrs loruso listens to the freaking podcast so but then like even this would
3287060	3293300	be like okay there was just a woman on stage and she was she just it's clear to me she's so sick
3293300	3298980	of her son's haunted house and she's trying to set up den and i was pitching her one night and
3298980	3305300	she came out of the house she checked timor's door to see if timor is asleep when you think
3305300	3310340	about timor you're like what does he have on his walls like how many what posters does he have and
3311540	3317220	like and then i think about myself and i'm like man like i wish i like i didn't have that i could
3317220	3321860	have never made a haunted house like i think i started making it so that's kind of the podcast
3322100	3323620	so it's all
3327380	3331940	it's all free association do you prepare anything you just could totally riff and just
3331940	3336660	just go with the flow so i do one free association one every week then i do one
3337300	3343300	like at that that's like soft scripted like outline with dialogue and then i do one on
3343300	3348260	like tv shows so right now i've been watching like there's a columbian version of breaking bad it's
3348260	3353780	called metastasis and it's like it's awesome it's like a shot for shot remake well almost shot for
3353780	3360420	shot so and this is how ill i am it's called metastasis like tumors yeah because because
3360420	3368180	walter white i'd never saw it sorry one day they have to focus more on the cancer than the drugs
3369700	3374580	in this version because yeah it's not some things are more shocking than others like
3374580	3379860	but yeah like so i'll watch i'll watch the columbian version of breaking bad then i'll watch
3379860	3384900	breaking bad i'll take a ton of notes and then i'll just be like uh walter it's walter blanco so i'll
3384900	3399540	be like walter blanco but they left they left walter and saw bueno it's really good like the
3399540	3405220	acting it's not like a joke like it it made me appreciate breaking bad so what is it that draws
3405220	3409540	you to it because you said i think you you said uh you're you're you're actually kind of teaching
3409540	3414740	yourself spanish or brushing up in your spanish for that i've learned about i've watched 61 episodes
3414740	3420100	i probably like twice and i probably like still know the same words when i failed out of spanish
3420100	3424020	in high school but what is what is drawing you to that because when i hear about that i think okay
3424020	3427700	i'd like to watch a five minute clip of that but but what do you what do you so you're really
3427700	3431380	you're hooked on a thing that you already know the story and you're he said he's a bit obsessive
3431380	3436820	about your yeah i think it's like well one it's like for making anything every single week it's
3436820	3440980	like i gotta watch it every week so like people are like oh why don't you do something like
3441540	3445380	the smurfs or something and i'm like well i'd lose my mind like i could watch two weeks of
3445380	3451300	the smurfs but breaking bad is a great show and then it's just interesting watching like a kind
3451300	3456340	of columbian interpretation it's always it's always giving you something to cut because it's
3456340	3462180	lateral i think i think i get that now so it's a it correct me if i'm wrong this is maybe
3462180	3467300	something that you wouldn't do at all if you didn't have this podcast to contend with exactly
3467300	3472740	like you're actually using it to like kind of charge a battery yeah because like you know when
3472740	3475860	you're like you're watching something and then you're like kind of like start playing around on
3475860	3482500	your phone or whatever like this like i have to be engaged and i don't know i guess like because
3482500	3486980	it's like pointlessly challenging i don't know but what about that drives me but it's like
3487780	3492020	like almost like i was like i'm not gonna watch 62 i'm gonna watch 62 episodes of this columbian
3492020	3496580	breaking bad but then it's like i have to find material in it so it's like i'm mining and i'm
3496580	3500100	watching their shirts and stuff and i'm like oh that's boring i could talk about a shirt for eight
3500100	3506180	minutes like no problem so so we've got a mind capable of that and we've got somebody who also
3506180	3514180	in the episode not to spoil it but you almost inexplicably focus in you're trying to decode my
3514900	3521780	story model uh you you choose to use this amazing song from a chorus line the musical
3522500	3528340	why is that your favorite song why and why are which song i feel nothing nothing yeah oh yeah
3528340	3534500	like just because or just every day for a week yeah it's a good song well like it just like i
3534500	3540020	think like it it it goes back to like why why do certain people can't sleep like overthinking
3540020	3546580	people or people that obsess about stuff and it's like that song does have some truth in it and
3546580	3551780	then it has this like feeling for me it's like oh wait i'm dead inside like so so like i'm like
3551780	3556340	when i hear the song i think about that like and i like it better because i'm like okay she's
3556340	3561780	singing about this surface thing and then there's this whole other thing going on within the story
3561860	3567700	of the song and then there's like the truth behind it like right like like just whatever
3567700	3572340	happened out here on the stage with the freaking haunted house it's like yeah like you could start
3572340	3577300	to unpack that it's like and i mean the fact that you talked you text with your neighbor that's
3577300	3586740	great she texts with me and i and i and i respond every time i said no don't don't don't be sad
3586740	3593300	it's she'll be fine she'll be back next week uh but but but i'm so intrigued by that because
3593940	3599540	i just real quick real quick this might be might be pricky of me to say this did
3600340	3608020	how much zero to 100 percent do you think that she engaged you in that text conversation because
3608020	3613540	she said it might parlay into being back up here i don't i think i think zero percent i think zero
3613780	3618180	i think zero percent at the beginning and and then ten percent ten percent all the way through
3618180	3624020	just like me i i think i don't know i was like i like her i'm not i'm not i don't mean that to
3624020	3628660	disparage her in any way i was like but like is there a part of her like like does she love being
3628660	3635060	up here so much that like like she engages with you for that you know let's let that let's let's
3635060	3638820	let's let's let's not be addicted to dichotomy i mean what are we learning with this election
3638820	3643620	like oh like like if we if we follow the path of good person bad person long enough we're going
3643620	3647940	to end up in a fucking desert where we're going to lose our fucking minds because like like the
3647940	3652820	truth is like we're all just different kinds of people and like like like i i just like like you
3652820	3658100	know is she is she is she a good neighbor is she a bad neighbor am i a bad neighbor am i a bad
3658100	3662660	person like should i let more light into my life should i read her screenplay is she an attention
3662660	3670340	whore is is is fame bad is is is everything it's like these questions like like like i my my my
3670340	3675140	epiphany lately in in in therapy and just in thinking about it and driving to work with
3675140	3681220	spencer every day is just like dichotomy is like a crutch like dichotomy is laziness is
3681220	3686180	ideological laziness like we've talked about this like like the idea that it's things are
3686180	3691540	one thing or the other is kind of like it's it's an addiction and it's a comfort zone and it's like
3691540	3697460	i don't know you know like like i'm not saying that it's binary that she is all one or all the
3697460	3702020	other but no i'm not trying to high road you also that sounds like i'd sound like i'm a little high
3702020	3707460	flown saying that an answer to your thing but but i also just like i'm like yeah look i i don't know
3707460	3712580	she's my neighbor beth like she like she's like a character i don't know you know joey let's check
3712580	3721380	check back in with you did you get your tarot cards joey oh shit what card is that joey
3721540	3726100	to his credit has sat there in graveyard silence the entire time we're just totally digging it
3727300	3735700	i'm very excited to be here oh shit i love you joey so this is for you uh you are the king of cups
3735700	3740900	i don't know the individual's name but if anyone could find out who was the first person to use
3740900	3747540	ether to anesthetize therapeutically that is who his past life was isn't dan the king of cups
3747540	3755060	i i i'm in the night of cups oh that's like my favorite bug's money routine too so the ether
3755060	3761700	one so you're saying that he is the he's the reincarnation of the person that first used
3761700	3767860	ether to anesthetize that's right really how does that come to you is that some sort of divinic thing
3767860	3773540	that happens let's see oh we have we have a google search perfect god our fans are awesome okay they
3773540	3780260	would never steal a sign so sorry yeah you know but you know i don't mean to kiss your
3780260	3784260	ass but you did notice in that text conversation i was i was kind of sticking up for you guys
3790980	3798820	yes human human teeth and chloroform it says that william thomas green morton
3798900	3806100	who lived from august 9th 1819 to july 15 1868 was an american dentist who first publicly
3806100	3813700	demonstrated the use of inhaled ether as a surgical anesthetic how did he die 1846 uh
3817460	3823300	he died on an ether bench i think he went on ether and cut his leg open and bled to death
3823300	3826820	oh really that's what i asked maybe that's chloroform that's my favorite scene and fear
3826820	3830900	and loathing in the book by hunter s thompson where he just pours ether on the floorboard of
3830900	3836020	his car and the convertible so he just wafts up after driving and he goes into circus circus
3836020	3842580	and loses his fucking shit that's how you do it well sorry so bid back diving into uh
3846420	3852900	it's the most wonderful time of the day when the planes are all falling and buildings
3852980	3864900	are don't fucking do that you cheer for 9 11 every week uh when you when that song on paper
3864900	3870100	i've only i'm only familiar with the movie uh but uh that song the lyrics to that song on paper
3870740	3876900	make me think that that is the story of somebody who is realizing that the dichotomy of feeling
3876900	3883860	versus not feeling is a flawed dichotomy and that she is escaping it and realizing that
3884580	3891460	she can cry in the end like what makes her cry is the fact that she is numb what makes her cry is
3891460	3898660	her alienation um it may it's like and and and that is not foreign to me and i felt like you were
3898660	3904740	kind of like yeah that's the idea that like don't tell me to lie don't tell me that i know what i'm
3904740	3909140	an ice cream cone like like if you make me pretend to be an ice cream cone i feel nothing
3909140	3915540	and then when he died she feels nothing yeah but also she feels nothing so passionately that maybe
3915540	3919540	we need new language for feeling versus not feeling and that you don't you know you know you
3919540	3923700	want to rely on oh you either know what an ice cream cone feels like or you or you're or you're
3923700	3931140	not empathic i mean you know are we talking about my girl what this is uh chorus line oh of course
3931140	3936740	yeah yeah because uh on stage uh i was with greg proof's on stage last night and i said
3936740	3943860	at line in a like in a dumb game and i said uh who am i anyway am i my resume and greg said am
3943860	3949620	i a picture of a person i don't know and there's one girl in the balcony like wow it's just like
3949620	3953940	because she was probably just in a chorus line or loves that movie but like this those songs are
3953940	3959700	really dark and really great so have you drew felt throughout your life uh intellectually
3959700	3965620	rattling and emotionally numb is that does that lead to insomnia does that lead to
3966820	3973780	uh a connection with people who are as you say uh joining you across the deep dark like
3973780	3979620	are you look look talk talk about your your relationship with the universe do you think
3979620	3985700	people are bad do you think do you hate everybody do you not like do you look at them as like uh
3985700	3993060	i won't give you options you just go i think it's like like like uh my interest in doing the
3993060	3998180	podcast came out of this like miserable thing like when i couldn't sleep and i'd be thinking
3998180	4005220	about going to school and like i went to catholic school and like me and the nuns did not get along
4005220	4010980	like they just fucking hated me and like i had i think i had like undiagnosed dyslexia or something
4011620	4016500	and they were like oh no you're just lazy like they're like you you have the ability to do the
4016500	4023060	work but you choose not to so then i like internalize that whatever it's like okay so it's you versus me
4023060	4027620	like all right so now i know the kind of deal like a little bit of a dichotomy because i was like a kid
4027620	4033540	like like these authority figures are out to get me and i'm this kid and i think that just led to
4033540	4036820	me trying to figure stuff out at night like i'd be lying there thinking well what am i going to do
4036820	4040340	what am i going to say like and i think i still did let's like well make it be a good guess when
4040420	4044500	i go in harm's way what am i going to do like and there's like oh let me read some more about
4044500	4051620	dan would say but uh like there's a part like there's another thing that's like oh whoa man
4051620	4056820	calm down like and i don't have like total access to that whenever except when i do the podcast but
4056820	4061220	it's like oh yeah those nuns like some super mellow part like dude you're pretty i mean you
4061220	4067220	might i might have to recruit you as like my like sit on my shoulder or something like to be like oh
4067220	4073300	you know what like and i think it was like the truth like in the song too is like that she's like
4073300	4078500	like in this put in the situation like she gets into this performing arts school and it's like oh
4078500	4083940	this is it this is i'm gonna make it now like uh and this is like this teacher mr karp who's a dick
4083940	4089780	spoiler and uh he teaches the improv class or whatever where she's supposed to feel all this
4089780	4095060	stuff i'm gonna make it now not to interject but because the idea of getting accepted to a school
4095060	4101780	that comes from a place of oh well these people need to be pleased and once they're pleased you're
4101780	4107940	fucking set you're going to hogwarts you're gonna be a wizard and and but then no you so anyways
4107940	4113220	yeah like and i don't know like like i was also trying to get inside your head like i was like oh
4113220	4119620	man like like once i started reading about how you think about story and stuff i don't know those
4119620	4123380	things just feel like puzzles a little bit or something like like and it just draws me
4124740	4132100	and like stuff that's like okay this isn't just about an entertaining story like just like not
4132100	4136740	being able to sleep or or like that scientists don't understand sleep it's like just like rick
4136740	4142100	and morty like there's way more there than you see on the first one or two watch flus it's like
4142740	4146740	there's something going on below the surface and that's what people connect to and like in this
4146740	4152580	song what i connected to is like she's like shit i don't care that he died like i i i'm in full
4152580	4157860	acceptance that i feel nothing and i don't know but the day that you say i don't care that this
4157860	4164420	person died well that is an that can be an incredibly fucking uh but mr carpool that the
4164420	4168660	teacher in that is telling all these students pretend that you're uh you're cold and pretend
4168660	4172500	that you're hot and pretend that you're this and everyone else is doing it and she thinks they're
4172500	4178020	all lying she's like she's like she's like i think it's all bullshit and she when this guy that
4178020	4182820	she was a professional bullshit artist dies like it doesn't mean anything to her like like she like
4182820	4188420	her identity had nothing to do with these weird tasks that she was asked to do yeah i took it as
4188420	4192420	like empowering too like she she didn't do this but like that she slammed the coffin and she's
4192420	4198340	like now i'm an actor carp fuck off like well there's no i mean if you think that the job of
4198340	4203380	acting is that is a psychotic job whether it's an audience or cameras that are staring at you
4203380	4210420	you have to be equally conscious of the fact that you are faking something as you are because if you
4210420	4214980	really believed you were an ice cream cone you'd turn your back to the audience for the entire
4214980	4218580	show you'd you you wouldn't you wouldn't you wouldn't hit your marks you wouldn't remember
4218580	4225380	your ice cream lines um you you you there's all kinds of reasons why you also simultaneously in
4225380	4229940	order to be so immersed in all this stuff you also have to be so hyper conscious of like where
4229940	4235860	your head is even more so with the with the cameras instead of the audience but the but the
4235860	4239780	that's the interesting thing i think about that the lyrics of that song is that it seems like
4239780	4244180	it's a writer exploring actually just kind of just two different acting schools and how they
4244180	4249060	kind of crisscross their dichotomies like can bisect each other to the point where you go oh
4249060	4254580	yeah okay so you have to pick one that you're happy with because hers turns out to be you know
4254580	4259780	what i'm the person that's that's capable of forgetting what the fuck anybody thinks
4260340	4267060	um and that could lead to really good acting because my calluses my barrier that i i have
4267060	4273860	around myself whether i like it or not like will allow me to plow through a terrible showing of
4273860	4278980	of speed the plow uh like like like it even though there's three people in the audience
4278980	4282580	and they're like a person from i i'm just like i don't know why i'm going into her biography
4282740	4286900	like it's a weird timeline but i'm just saying like there's different kinds of good actors and she
4287540	4292660	she's confident at the time of singing that song and what do you do you do you say you
4292660	4297300	have trouble sleeping yourself right you have anxiety and that keeps you up yeah yeah does does
4297300	4303140	you doing this podcast kind of busy up your day and occupy a part of your mind that allows you to
4303140	4308500	rest or do you still go to sleep with the same trouble that you're trying to assuage in other
4308500	4313700	people i think it makes me more aware and i think like the thing about the podcast is like
4313700	4319300	oh that i'm not the only person like suffering from that like like so i mean that's like the
4319300	4323540	main message i want to get in the like across the podcast is like okay i'm not going to come
4323540	4331380	to your house and and and read you a story or to steal your tarp like yeah yeah wrap myself in the
4331380	4339220	tarp and but but like that like like not being able to sleep sucks and like since i can relate
4339220	4344580	to that like i might not understand what other people are going through that can't sleep but
4344580	4349300	like but you've had people say to you that this really helps yeah that must feel great
4350500	4355780	i'm dead inside though so it's kind of oh you feel nothing you feel nothing but it's almost like
4355780	4361460	if you look at your your emotional connection to them as like water then this would be like
4361460	4367060	infusing it with like a fruit a fruit flavor oh yeah like fruit flavored water like with a
4367060	4373300	little fruit it's almost like a uh it sounds like you're talking about like a dream it sounds like
4373300	4379380	you're talking about hint water oh oh shit that's something i have experience with personally
4379380	4386340	i had the apple flavored one you did oh yeah no it was great especially tell me about your
4386340	4393140	personal experience with hint water apple flavor i had the apple flavored one no seriously it was
4393140	4402500	great i had it they sent it to us it tasted like apples oh boy i had it i had a watermelon one
4402500	4410420	tastes like watermelons real fruit flavor not this you know fake preservative unnatural flavor
4410420	4415620	stuff it's not like water that's had like some syrupy goo added to it it's no it tastes like
4415620	4419620	that's actually the cool part and this is this is a real advertisement because i'm trying to
4419620	4425940	convince you guys of something but it actually is cool that it's like a fruit flavored beverage
4425940	4432340	that's not it's not overbearing in any way as exactly as refreshing as water but just has the
4434180	4441460	a lot of fruit wasn't it i mean i i don't want to come off like i'm reading the highlighted
4441460	4446740	portions of this piece of paper that i have here but especially it sounds like you just ad lib the
4446740	4452260	intro with the personalized story uh that will resonate with our audience and i will add to that
4452260	4463780	i'd agree when i my when i tasted the hint water i i i had i had got the distinct impression that
4463780	4468660	it was invented by a woman that that that had just had her fourth child you're talking about
4468660	4473300	kara golden you're talking about kara golden and not because i'm reading this off of the paper
4473300	4479620	because she's the hint water person personally invested in her story not because they highlighted
4479620	4484020	everything you have to say and then it said the the following points and it includes her
4484020	4489940	entire biography of having four children and then she got sick of diet soda because it didn't have
4489940	4494260	that crisp refreshing water taste i was telling you about in that great intro she was bored she
4494260	4499540	was bored with the liquids in her life water is boring man water is boring but what what are my
4499540	4507780	options hint water that's the whole point of what we're doing hint water wait jeff you're not on

4574420	4580900	if you're bored with water i mean who isn't and everybody water you know very soon yeah we get
4580900	4586580	it you've got two hydrogens and one oxygen or whatever it's like yawn where's the fruit
4586580	4594340	where's the fruit water exactly scientists argue that that we will not be bored with water within
4594340	4600260	10 years that it will be a very exciting commodity uh we'll be happy to see it when we see it but
4600820	4605780	until then scientists are working right now to find other planets and not only have liquid
4605780	4613860	water but have liquid water infused with fruit because we found there's so many planets right
4613860	4617540	now that probably are in the goldilocks zone where there won't be liquid water but we think
4617540	4621540	because we live in such an infinite galaxy and universe we can hold out some of them are going
4621540	4626980	to be and going to be blackberry flavored and they have they have actually found a lot of planets
4626980	4633540	with uh flavored water but they all contain preservatives or sugar so it's like worthless
4633540	4639620	and calories the calories it's crazy what gets you what's the point yeah but until we
4639620	4645460	have the ability to travel to these distant watermelon and pineapple flavored planets
4645460	4651940	right you can just go to drink h-i-n-t they deliver to your house they fucking bring in
4651940	4657780	heavy water is you don't have to carry it all right i think that's all the points i actually
4658420	4662580	i actually heard they found a planet where it what it did have no sugar and and all that stuff
4662580	4671140	but also then they passed it by because it it didn't offer the discount oh yeah that you get
4671140	4675940	when you yeah because no because i was more than 24 dollars that planet still charged 24 dollars
4675940	4680820	24 dollars which is not a bad price for like good water you go to drink hint.com
4680820	4686980	harmontown you're you're you're saving your nine dollars uh financially no you're you're the you're

4780100	4790580	are you a fan of musicals uh drew joey well i mean that one just hit home like because i was
4790580	4795540	actually in in a car with somebody listening that song and i'm like oh shit i feel nothing like
4796180	4802660	and i was like oh man like so it kind of cut deep i guess so if i said i love you
4805620	4814660	i'd say oh man i'm hungry like uh that's good it makes me love you you sent me jokingly said that
4814660	4820900	you're you're you're dead inside that you have a numbness to you uh i mean is that true or is
4820900	4826260	that just you kind of comedically deflecting stuff i would say it's an issue i have probably
4826260	4833220	like uh it's because you have a history of not you you what you've noticed well you're taking
4833220	4840260	data is that the responses that you're capable of giving are are being received by other people
4840260	4846820	you're getting you're getting returned data from them that's saying that response was less than
4846820	4852820	different than more than i expected and you are keeping score for yourself and you're going like
4852820	4857860	yeah i'm not that good at this people thing yeah i mean i think like with uh not to go back to the
4857860	4863380	halloween side but it's like oh is there a way dan's supposed to reply to that first text like
4865060	4870020	and it's like and then you're like oh well should i i mean i'm glad you just do yourself like yeah
4870100	4876740	i just fucking went to just locked horns with her like a fucking ram and then she's like twisting
4876740	4883460	like i'm like oh shit who's gonna win like uh but but yeah i i just i well i just like it's this
4883460	4887300	idea of dead inside like i don't know when we had steve silberman on who was like we wrote this
4887300	4893380	amazing book uh called neurotribes which is about neurodiversity doesn't have to do with like oh you
4893380	4899780	have asperger's you are autistic you are in the spec like like it's just like like like
4899780	4907380	can we embrace this concept of neurodiversity where there's it's like now that the internet's
4907380	4914260	here and we're a more text-based society what we're i think we're coming into a realization that oh
4914260	4920740	a lot of humanity doesn't necessarily have this like total average facility there's
4920740	4925940	almost artificial construct of normality when you run into somebody in public and you oh you're
4925940	4930660	learning their names and you have like people trouble with names and faces and nervous and
4930660	4938820	i don't know like i i i just like it it like this idea i feel like the idea of being dead
4938820	4943300	inside the idea that oh this person isn't doesn't have empathy and all that stuff like it's it's
4943300	4948660	like it's archaic language like it's it kind of it's it's problematic as the kids would say like
4948660	4955460	because it's it it takes you into a zone of you're either chattner or you're or you're
4955460	4958660	leonard namoy like you're you're i don't know why i use the actor's names
4961220	4965060	you're either kirk or you're Spock like you're you're either like oh i'm gonna fly in through
4965060	4969220	the windows and fuck a green lady and like like like that's how i saw i saved the universe with
4969220	4974260	my dick because i love feeling um and then and then or you're either that or you're Spock and
4974260	4980660	like i don't understand and it's like the whole like nerd face thing of like oh Spock you have
4980660	4985540	feelings and stuff it's like come on what is a feeling what does it even mean like like you
4985540	4991140	at the end of your podcast you sit and thank a thousand people people anybody who tweets you
4991140	4996820	you like people are messaging you and going oh my band's playing and like you you you you sit there
4996820	5001940	and like go go like oh you go go see this guy's band and like all this shit you're pathetic
5002260	5008660	you're a sappy sop it's a good thing i'm dead inside it doesn't bother me at all you're dripping
5008660	5013700	in feelings like just like just from a different angle you just have to get the glint like you're
5013700	5018820	because it's a it's a it's a responsibility to other people i'm drunk yeah i mean i think what
5018820	5023940	you're like i get drunk at this point they think about the internet is like that it gets all this
5023940	5028980	like you're saying with the neurodiversity it's like oh wait like i'm not the only freak out
5028980	5035780	there like i guess i would classify myself as a spaz if we were in the uh ferris bueller spectrum
5035780	5042260	of like social disorders but like then you realize like like i started the podcast and i was like
5042260	5045540	huh i wonder if there's anybody out there that wants some weird ass bedtime stories
5046100	5050980	and then i was like oh wait there are and then it was like then they then they started telling
5050980	5056740	people and it's like i guess what you're saying is like i can hear that because it's like oh yeah
5056740	5062100	like who gives shit how like like i can't respond perfectly to everything like yeah just because
5062100	5066100	that's not just because if somebody came over for a cup of sugar you wouldn't like say the right
5066100	5070420	thing isn't the right cue it doesn't mean you're it's like no i'm fucking busy with my other thing
5070420	5074180	that i connect with people through a different channel like that's what a painter is or a
5074180	5078020	furniture maker or uh what do they call the guys that bring the mail a mail bringer
5080820	5086020	yeah but i mean i think those postal workers there's an expression going postal it means to
5086020	5088580	to give your your feelings a different outlet
5092100	5097300	yeah but like with the dichotomy thing like if you only could fit into these two boxes i think
5097300	5100980	that's like half the reason why everybody feels so alone i mean other than the shit you think about
5100980	5106340	when you're lying in bed like oh good but but like then if you're like oh wait like yeah there's a
5106340	5110820	ton of other people that fit into this box with me or the box doesn't have walls or whatever but
5110820	5115540	then when you're like oh do you like the guy with the bad hair like are you for america or are you
5115540	5121780	against america it's like what the fuck like i like the idea that he was like i i find myself
5122580	5127380	alternating like equally offended the idea that that that he represents bad people and
5128340	5132740	because it's like fuck you he's a shitty bad person like he's bad at being shitty like i get
5132740	5137380	i get mad i'm like he's a bad nazi he's a bad fascist like like like hitler would have done
5137380	5141860	way better but but by now like it's like he doesn't even know what he's doing like he can't
5141860	5146260	even do it right like you're bad hitler i want to like tweet at him you're bad hitler wrong you're
5146260	5156820	a bad wrong yeah well hitler such a nasty man such a nasty man such a nasty man uh but but
5157460	5162500	the it's funny like the dichotomy thing though i would have been a great hitler i would have been
5162500	5169300	great i have so many people right now right now if you if you go on all the i would have built a
5169300	5174980	wall out of jews best hitler i've killed more jews i'm killing more jews the slobs would have
5174980	5180900	paid for all of the nazis say i'm the best they say i'm a better nazi than a nazi yes um i have
5180900	5185380	all of the um you're gonna do a great great stalingrad would have fallen so fast your head
5185380	5191220	would have spun it's gonna be a true it's true believe it's true third and a half reich uh it's
5191220	5193860	gonna be i would have had so many reichs there would have been it would have been a million reichs
5194100	5197220	each reich would have lasted for 10 million years
5200660	5210740	uh we're gonna we're gonna invade china they have a great wall um but the it's funny how
5210740	5214820	sometimes dichotomy you can't just count it either it's not as easy as saying oh
5214820	5220500	it's like gluten so let's do away with dichotomy we use it all the time to get to the bottom of
5220820	5225140	it's like well look let's step back from this look at one of two paths here either we're going
5225140	5230100	to do this or we're going to do that it's such a healthy thing to do most half of the time probably
5230100	5235220	half of the time and then and then the probably half the time probably most of the time probably
5235220	5240740	the best times um you're either building a wall or you're not building a wall but but but the
5241700	5245700	the other half of the time it's like i was sitting there like i was watching
5245700	5251700	cody like crumble to the floor during the debates and scream when he said nasty woman
5251700	5257140	like like when he all of the things it's like it's like nails on a chalkboard then i'm noticing
5257140	5265300	myself going like uh baby he's not gonna win and then she goes like i know and then i'm thinking
5265300	5272020	like oh well why are you fucking being dramatic then and then and then later on she's like upset
5272020	5275620	again and then i go like i thought you said you knew he wasn't going to win and she's like i just
5275620	5279460	said that because you made me feel stupid earlier i'm like i wasn't trying to make you feel stupid
5279460	5283300	i was trying to make you feel safe i don't know that he's not going to win i'm just being a man
5283300	5288580	i'm just being a man i was like and it was this crazy meta thing like i was being a man i was
5288580	5293620	trying to like pat her on the back during the debates and tell her the orange man's not going
5293620	5301540	to win like that's my job as a man during debates and it's like i was like so then you go outward
5301540	5306580	on that Fibonacci curve and you go like well okay so like somewhere along it's just like well
5312180	5317860	he's not gonna win and and he can't win and and and that doesn't but and but here's the
5319300	5321060	what do you want a five-party system you got it
5323700	5327780	you probably stay pretty apolitical also what do you do about tonality that's what i was going to
5327940	5331300	that's tough because you had you had you had to put a warning on your episode
5332340	5338660	uh that was a hairpin turn man well hairpin turned next to the labrea tarpon which
5339780	5346980	everyone very everyone very values it bigly um the the but you you had to put a little swear
5346980	5355540	words warning on your episode of mine uh what how do you how do you freely like just be yourself and
5355540	5361620	then like where do you stand in terms of why aren't you just saying shit and fucking yeah it's
5361620	5367220	just like tough like it's tough like not being able like it's like okay try to avoid talking
5367220	5371380	about the election hall because people are going to go away like it like i guess it's like keeping
5371380	5376900	in mind somebody's lying in bed and like sometimes it's going to be like a grandmotherly like woman
5376900	5380740	and like i always that's why i like take so much time to kind of explain that the podcast is kind
5380740	5385380	of weird because i always like think of this like this little old lady putting on like her
5385380	5391860	shawl and putting on oh she told me to listen to the podcast and then it's like what the hell is
5391860	5398020	he talking about like why does he love abortion so much yeah i'm trying to get some sleep do you do
5398020	5403220	a little like uh proviso at the beginning like you do like do an explainer at the top of each
5403220	5407940	episode or you kind of just get right into business it's kind of like there's like this 12-minute
5407940	5414820	intro at least where it's almost like its own show where i just like ramble on and on like okay
5414820	5419860	this is the podcast put you to sleep it's like uh i was like i was thinking about water the other
5419860	5424500	day and and and i was drinking oh wait sorry i'm in the middle of the podcast intro and then
5424500	5431380	but i'll do isn't water too boring for most i mean i was wishing i had like apple flavored water
5432020	5436420	why don't we just can we lower the lights for a minute and just have you just like
5436420	5442260	like relax and have you just treat us to the cadence that you usually use i just want to
5442260	5448500	give people a taste also everybody take your shirts off do we it's too late to ask for any
5448500	5451700	like wind chimes back there or anything you don't usually you don't use anything like that
5453620	5461540	30 seconds for wind chimes all right 29 28 well this brings up a good thing like with wind chimes
5461620	5467780	it's like when you go to a wind chime store do you think about like what's your favorite
5467780	5472980	bamboo wind chime what's your favorite wind chime store in town i like wind chimes wind chimes wind
5472980	5479140	chimes like uh i don't know and then it's like you want them big or small or the ones that are
5479140	5483300	like a xylophone because then it's like well then when that person comes home they're going to run
5483300	5488580	their hands across the stupid xylophone and it's going to drive me nuts so maybe i'll just get the
5489220	5496820	but i hate those bamboo wind chimes and like like i try to lie there and think about yeah the wind
5496820	5502660	chimes i used to hear when i was on that dock that one time like lying there on that dock
5503300	5511460	the dock was bouncing up and down and i was staring at the clouds and i was just i was like
5511460	5516580	man like uh those wind chimes are gonna wake my dad up he's gonna go ape shit so i got off the
5516580	5523860	dock and walked up to the house and i was walking up the dock and i stopped at the dock
5523860	5530500	and then i looked in the water there was a fish there and i was looking at the fish and i remember
5530500	5540420	that time that guy was down there at the bottom way down all the way down and then i was thinking
5540420	5544740	like how did he get on that spaceship that one time like because i was watching that one where
5544740	5553300	he's on the spaceship and his mask was different and like i was i was like man like how did he get
5553300	5560020	a new mask like is that like was that some kind of interstellar shit like and then oh yeah because
5560020	5567700	interstellar like what if uh what if he got sucked into a black hole and then uh and then he'd like
5567700	5575060	and then my dad dropped his beer in the dock and then i said oh shit uh better be quiet and not talk
5575060	5583300	over these wind chimes but i i was like uh i was thinking about like uh that guy who's his name he
5583300	5589300	seemed like so this would be the package i couldn't say freddie one for uh jason but i said voorhees
5589300	5594900	like did you have any known any voorhees before because voorhees is a good voorhees
5595780	5606820	voorhees like voorhees i started hearing things and then i started feeling angry
5606820	5613860	like it was the wind chimes and they kept they kept going ringing over and over i'm never going
5613940	5618340	to sleep again this is a nightmare
5626420	5634260	i never get to kill people uh yeah he usually works in a way i just picture a lot of a lot
5634260	5641860	of grandmothers just wide awake this is this is the end but is there a is there a guiding principle
5641860	5647540	that keeps you from as you said when you picture that old woman with the shawl which which which
5647540	5651460	which let's use her as a symbol of like that's a reason to not get political that's a reason to
5651460	5657940	not use profanity um how is that what what compass do you is there like a guiding principle that keeps
5657940	5664180	you clear of all of that no and like i find like using like i guess i struggle with that because
5664180	5670340	it's like i think some people when you swear it makes them feel more connected like like this
5670340	5677620	vanillaizing of everything like actually i think excludes people or giving everything normalcy it's
5677620	5683860	like oh my podcast is not normal like it's not like like so it's like i struggle with like oh
5683860	5688740	people like i can't believe you swore i'm never listening again and then i feel ashamed or whatever
5688740	5694260	but then i'm like well like i think there's four probably four thousand people that feel like oh
5694340	5700660	finally someone's swearing on a sleep podcast so in your in your day-to-day life the person
5700660	5706340	that you are if i'm hanging out with you uh and how often are you saying the word fuck shit and
5706340	5713620	whatnot because i'm saying it every other word i mean probably pretty often like i mean so that's
5713620	5717220	the confusing thing to me is that you're being yourself like you're you're you're going to the
5717220	5721940	you're going down the mind that that i'm going down but you're somehow but you're kind of putting
5722580	5727860	drew more of like a like not not a character but you're going into a certain mode where you're
5727860	5733220	like you like if you had to put on the hat dan of let's make everybody feel relaxed you wouldn't
5733220	5738180	you know do you have kids i have one kid yeah and so is it possible that maybe you're
5738180	5742820	accessing that lobe where you're like she's listening is that your daughter i think it's like
5743620	5749940	part of it is like my internal critic is so loud and powerful and like so even when i sit down to
5749940	5756820	record the show like there's that that narrative track going like don't fuck this up like like so
5756820	5763460	it's like i try to like just get to this it's it unfortunately the podcast doesn't try try like
5763460	5769140	translate to my regular life where i can be like oh man go ahead and cut me off like like but like
5769140	5775380	so like to counteract my critic it's like i just it's the same part that people fall asleep to i
5775380	5780020	think because their critic or that aggressive part of themselves is what's poking at them like
5780020	5784500	as soon as you get in bed it's like why didn't you get this done today why why did you piss your
5784500	5790500	pants you know and it's like and and then you're like like like the person starts to like buy into
5790500	5795060	that story and they they just start listening at story so it's like i'm there and i'm like well
5795060	5798100	here's another story you can listen to it doesn't really make a lot of sense it doesn't really go
5798100	5802660	anywhere and i think like at the same time i'm like trying to i'm like listen dude we're just
5802740	5807780	making a podcast put people to sleep here like this isn't like a fourth draft or something right
5807780	5812260	when i asked you earlier down when i said earlier that that must make you feel good that you help
5812260	5816500	people deal with their insomnia or go to sleep when you said no i feel nothing but like do you
5816500	5820100	feel like this is a benevolent thing you're doing or is that not why you're doing it is this more
5820100	5824980	just you getting something off of your chest or do you how important is it that you might be helping
5824980	5830900	other strangers up i mean it could be unpacked by like psychologists like i think part of it is like
5830900	5837460	really narcissistic like that when i was a kid i couldn't sleep and i lied there in bed miserable
5838100	5841460	and i didn't feel like i was like all right you're on your own to deal with this
5842020	5848180	and i can't go back in time to fix that you know so i think like if like a cold ass psychiatrist
5848180	5852100	would be like oh well that's just what you're trying to do just trying to go back but i guess
5852100	5858500	like it is cool like if i hear from somebody like that has like ptsd like from some something that
5858500	5863620	happened i guess i do feel stuff sometimes like it's like holy shit like this silly thing i'm doing
5864180	5869300	can help distract you from something that's horrific or or does that warm you up a little
5869300	5875460	bit like how do you how do you absorb that that compliment or do you just stick it in a drawer
5875460	5879780	somewhere and think deal with it later yeah i guess i try to put it in like this basket of like
5880500	5886820	okay this this is this is this real like am i really helping people i always just put it in
5886820	5892660	a bin that's like okay so that's like a firewood pile like called i won't get kicked out of society
5892660	5898580	for that amount of time like every time someone writes and says like ah you helped because uh
5898580	5903140	this feely feely thing and then i go like uh good so you'll have my back when they're about to throw
5903140	5909620	me off a cliff it is really weird like like from harmontown and from like like doing other comedy
5909620	5914900	shows like who's lying like people walk up and they say hey like it's really common like strangely
5914900	5920020	common that people come up and say like you helped me through a really hard time like i was sick
5920660	5926100	or i was in hospital or my mother was going through a thing like people have like these really
5926100	5930580	intense connections to this stupid thing that we're like i mean not that this is stupid but
5930580	5935140	it is stupid we're just we're it's irresponsible and we don't think about it we just show up half
5935140	5941700	drunk and do this thing but uh but people like have these weird connections to it and when they say
5941780	5946500	you really helped me through some major shit and your instinct is to go oh you gotta get out more
5947620	5954100	and deflect that but really that's like that's a major thing to unload but it's also it also
5954100	5960340	doesn't you you can't like translate it in anything that starts with your value like i always i've
5960340	5966660	come to look at it like if you were in a pool and people are just grabbing you that's a bad example
5966740	5972260	because someone's gonna drown but but like if you're in the dark or everyone's on ecstasy
5972260	5977300	it's a confusing party you're in a hay maze or something like somebody somebody grabbing you
5977300	5984660	and saying i'm so glad you're here i i'm so glad i ran into you uh i remember you from before
5984660	5990420	by the entrance to the hay maze uh um and and i was with my girlfriend i don't know if you remember
5990500	5996580	her but i lost her and like i just seeing you like reminds me but i you kind of like you you
5996580	6002500	were like oh so we are catchers in the riot i didn't read the book i they tried to make us
6004260	6008900	i just i just i got a hundred on the test and it just like click it's a alienation yeah got it but
6008900	6013380	but but i i think it's something about that like it's like like like like you're you're
6013380	6018420	you're running into each other and people are expressing that like it's not it's not oh you're
6019060	6022980	you did something good like your snake oil is better than other snake oil
6022980	6028500	it's like oh when you put yourself out there when you get onto the dance floor even if you're doing
6028500	6034420	a silly dance even if you're that that that sooner or later you're you you get to experience the
6034420	6041620	sensation of dancing with other people that they will someone will go yay i like i like
6041620	6046500	you're i'm so glad you're out here because these weddings suck yeah yeah i mean i think it's like
6046500	6050500	the other thing i mean it makes me think of two things one it like also connects you like you're
6050500	6054660	like well shit i know what it's like to lie there i might not know what it's like to have PTSD
6055380	6058100	but i know what it's like to lie there over you will now yeah yeah
6060340	6069460	but like i peteed him all right i i you you pre-teed him tb tb you pre-teed his sd
6069460	6073860	all right tb tb we'll figure it out later but i mean the other thing is people don't get credit
6073860	6078500	for being nice like it's like all the people that say thank you for shit like everybody's
6078500	6083540	always heaping on and i mean i guess i'm a cynical person too but it's like i've been blown away like
6083540	6089540	you're saying that people will come up to like that people are thankful like it's like no no
6089540	6097380	when we look at all this election shit and like oh how do you think about it like it's like oh
6097380	6102260	wait there's tons of people out there and they might even be people that believe in the crazy
6102260	6108260	like the other stuff but it's like that are saying like thank you like i don't know it is
6108260	6115300	definitely like making the show it has made me maybe like a softer person or been like man there
6115300	6120500	is some good in the world despite like uh like presuming there isn't or whatever i don't know
6120500	6125860	when you do one do you do you have that kind of sense of like some sort of sense of accomplishment
6125860	6130820	or just or just or is it simply just like oh i did one thing today that was semi or possibly
6130820	6136420	productive and so like that can rest a little easier it's more like i guess if if i have like
6136420	6144340	one out of every 30 episodes or 40 episodes and i like i feel like like damn that came out good
6144340	6149780	even if it's not good like i don't know like once every 40 episodes i'll have one done i'll be like
6149780	6154980	oh like that felt really good like and i don't care like i can make it another 40 episodes i'm
6155060	6160820	curious though because like i i get so i'm so into detail like like almost to the point of
6160820	6164260	distraction that i i don't know that i would fall asleep i think that i was like where's he going
6164260	6169700	this or even if you're not going anywhere that's okay like yeah i think that's part of the
6169700	6174260	interesting thing is that as we said at the beginning if a doctor tells you to chew on a
6174260	6179700	straw like you the straw chewing is just gonna it sends you into this weird thing and like
6180340	6186420	he's like hey listen by the way if you also if you find yourself uh very focused on what i'm
6186420	6190740	saying you know that's okay too you're not doing it wrong uh you may fall asleep to something else
6190740	6197300	after joey are you a good sleeper are you are you uh oh yes i um i sleep all the time
6201460	6209060	this guy's the best oh my god well i think if we can pack both into five minutes each i would say
6209060	6215860	one thing i would like to try is joey could you give us a tarot reading for next week's episode i
6215860	6223700	guess do you do you ever do you ever do do am i abusing you by asking you to precog like is that
6223700	6235300	no i'm sure that the spirits are willing you know so good with with spirits here's a cynical
6235300	6240020	question joey while you're going through that yeah um your positivity which you seem to exude oh
6240020	6251380	thank you uh i knew you were gonna say that uh it's not an act at all now i'm being dichotomy
6251380	6256420	a guy like this is like you're not pushing down some other like rage part of yourself
6256500	6262100	are you actually this this groovy like for real oh uh yeah um
6264580	6271860	i'm a i'm a good mormon boy um that's that's a thing right like i the mormons i went to high
6271860	6275540	school with were the coolest like they were like they seem to be the most well-adjusted like
6275540	6281460	they like their families and shit right yeah no yeah that's that's definitely part of it um
6282180	6286340	and no there are a couple weird ones uh yeah well no definitely there are the weird ones uh
6288340	6295620	so so being being nice is is uh a virtue uh but being um
6297380	6304900	someone who likes people is a gift and so if you like people it's easy to be nice
6305860	6314340	yeah there you are but liking people is a skill oh well because because i i i like people i like
6314340	6319220	strangers but also i can be really misanthropic like like like the flip of a coin like i can
6319220	6323940	like like people can be like when i'm driving everyone's an enemy and then but then i could
6323940	6328580	be at the airport and just be in a certain mood where i'm very philanthropic and really into
6328580	6332660	everybody yeah but do you go through that too are you are you do you have you mastered a skill
6332740	6338660	where you can like you're equinanimous to just all things at all times well cannabis helps
6341620	6349700	cheater yeah thank you so much it is true so all right i have never been i i want you to have
6349700	6357780	a podcast because your voice is soothing as fuck um we have the pulpit uh it's just a you know
6357780	6364340	something we're doing in utah we've had like 20 episodes and and we're so excited to have
6364340	6372420	urshine jane on this wednesday so we uh we get into all kinds of fun little esoteric things
6372420	6379220	that may inadvertently hurt people to sleep but we would encourage anybody to just
6380180	6385060	keep a dream journal about what they dream about after they listen to the podcast because
6385060	6390100	we need as many insights as possible because we're trying to predict to the end of the world
6392260	6401700	and and hence the tarot and i don't really have a um a trained uh use of these cards but oh good
6401700	6407380	okay okay yeah that's that's the last thing we would have wanted it just gets in the way of the
6407380	6416260	spirits so just let's just let's just let the cards fall the education the education will
6416260	6421700	inhibit the genius that's that's exactly so we'll let them fall where they may
6424180	6428820	all right you're on the floor yeah they just kind of stayed in a pile so we'll try this
6431860	6436820	that indicates well all of you see now if you hadn't have told me i would have thought you'd
6436820	6437780	studied this your whole life
6445140	6452340	like a magician so and you had asked me earlier about the creator of hint water uh and once again
6452340	6465940	that's cara golden yes yes so the card the card that came up uh is queen of cups so complement
6465940	6472740	nice to your card and um let me get that hint water fortune that's right uh so you're probably
6472740	6476980	going to mention hint water again is what the cards are saying that's that's what i'm getting
6476980	6484820	oh really yes and um it looks like the past life of cara golden is pamela goldman smith
6485380	6489860	the creator of the tarot deck because i think i forgot to take this part out of the
6496580	6498580	way
6500100	6506500	den uh your card is joker my card is hoyles rules of poker
6508420	6512180	all right our show has just become in a good way it's just become karson we're just karson
6513140	6518420	is there a guy with a lizard coming out next and jone emery is gonna come out
6518820	6529300	or a lady with a lizard nice save you get you're getting so good at these after thoughts yes
6530260	6537540	i call him cap doffers i'm learning now our president's going to be a space lady and i'm
6537540	6543060	gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna add or maybe it's a lady to the end of every expression i love yous
6543780	6549860	uh all right well so then i guess the last thing to do is to try to do if we can possibly accomplish
6549860	6558580	it what we do is like a sleep a sleepy rap and then but then the bridge is like and then if we
6558580	6566100	can is there any way to go from the rap beat to then the and then the wind chime silence and let
6566100	6573460	and let drew just feel like so i go so i do some rapping and then and then i and then it goes into
6573460	6580420	wind chimes and and drew like talks for a little bit probably like about what i rapped about and
6580420	6590820	then and then it goes back into me rapping and so on until 10 p.m can i lie on the floor uh that's
6590820	6595140	perfect yeah i think i think it would be rude of us to not let you do that
6602500	6605540	i don't know how i expected him to lie on the floor but it wasn't that
6609300	6615700	right absolutely 100 yeah yeah and and and you were pleasantly surprised right
6615700	6622820	right like like you didn't know it was going to be that adorable and take up that little space
