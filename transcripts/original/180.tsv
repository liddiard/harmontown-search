0	5000	Maybe I'm a fan of my young hotel
5000	9000	It's funny being under your spell
9000	11000	I'm introducing myself anyway
11000	13000	I'm here to comptroller Rhea Butcher
13000	18000	I can't know where to go
18000	21000	For meltdown comics in Hollywood, California
21000	23000	Harbertown is now in session
23000	27000	My happiness is running away
27000	28000	Yes
28000	29000	Yes
29000	30000	More
35000	36000	Ladies and gentlemen,
36000	38000	help me welcome to the stage
38000	40000	your Spencer
53000	55000	And the band of the three hours
56000	57000	Dan Harmon
63000	64000	Thank you
65000	67000	Comptroller Rhea Butcher
72000	74000	Congratulations on your wedding
74000	75000	Thank you, Dan
75000	76000	To Cameron
76000	77000	Yes
79000	81000	It is a real thing
82000	85000	I couldn't be a stronger supporter of gay marriage
85000	87000	I'd straight marriage
89000	90000	Me too
90000	92000	I just don't think it works
92000	94000	I think you guys take it more seriously
94000	97000	I think we should just hand off the mantle
97000	99000	We'll take care of it for a while
99000	102000	Obviously straight people have decided at some point
102000	106000	that we get married three times a lifetime minimum
106000	109000	It's like molting for us
110000	113000	I don't know, they have expressions for it
113000	116000	The third wife is the lizard wife
116000	117000	Yeah, yeah
118000	120000	Third wife, lizard wife
120000	122000	I think that's what you get
122000	124000	Paper anniversary, same thing
126000	129000	Well, the first time we met I think was on this stage
129000	131000	and we inadvertently found out
131000	133000	but it makes total sense looking at you
133000	135000	that you're a huge Back to the Future fan
136000	142000	Is it accurate to say that when you picked a look
142000	145000	you were like, I want to look like Marty McFly a little bit
145000	146000	Yeah, a little bit
146000	147000	and a little bit of George
147000	148000	and a little bit of Biff
148000	151000	You know, just like a little bit of each one
151000	153000	and then Lorraine at Hart, you know
154000	156000	1955 Lorraine at Hart
157000	159000	Not original 1985 Lorraine at Hart
159000	160000	No, God, no
160000	162000	Just a weird clay face
162000	164000	He's like Mummy John's performer
164000	167000	He wanted to reach up and just tell a story
170000	172000	We were both in San Francisco when you came back
172000	174000	You have a little story speaking of which
174000	175000	I do have a story
175000	179000	So this morning I was in San Francisco International Airport
179000	180000	which is a very small airport
180000	183000	and I saw this woman in a pair of uggs
183000	185000	and then just like a general airport outfit
185000	187000	and she looked very familiar to me
187000	188000	and I was like, no way
188000	190000	and then I started walking around a little bit more
190000	193000	I was like, I don't know, maybe
193000	194000	and then I saw her again
194000	195000	I was like, no way
195000	197000	and we got on the same plane together
197000	200000	She had like a bunch of teenage kids with her too
200000	202000	and we got on the same plane
202000	203000	and then as I passed her
203000	206000	she like turned on the seat to talk to somebody behind her
206000	207000	and I looked back
207000	211000	and it was, in fact, Leah Thompson
211000	212000	on my flight
212000	215000	and I was like, oh my God, it's your mother
215000	217000	Did you talk to her?
217000	218000	I did
218000	219000	I wasn't going to bother her
219000	221000	because it was a plane and stuff
221000	222000	but then I went to the bathroom
222000	223000	and she was walking back
223000	224000	and she was walking towards me
224000	225000	and I was like, I'm really sorry
225000	226000	but I have to just tell you
226000	227000	I'm a huge fan of yours
227000	228000	and I'm so sorry about that
228000	229000	and she was very nice
229000	230000	She was like, what's your name?
230000	231000	And I was like, oh, my name's Rhea
231000	233000	and she's like, oh, so close
233000	234000	Oh, no
236000	237000	And it was perfect
237000	239000	That's the Japanese version of my name
239000	240000	Yeah, yeah
240000	241000	Exactly
245000	251000	I had a fucking airport plane story as well
251000	253000	Fucking Delta
253000	254000	Cock
256000	257000	Fruit and cheese plate
257000	259000	Cock marrying Delta
261000	263000	Equal right, cock treating
264000	265000	Delta
265000	267000	I fucking, like, we were
267000	270000	I would never fly Delta by choice
271000	273000	but it was like the festival booked the flight
273000	274000	Sure
274000	275000	So flying back
275000	276000	I am so sorry
276000	279000	but I have not flown coach since the first time
279000	280000	I flew first class
280000	281000	I put it up
282000	284000	I really, literally have not
285000	287000	Except for maybe once to Las Vegas
287000	288000	because it was like
289000	291000	But, like, so, you know, I mean
292000	294000	I fucking, oh
296000	298000	Again, always with the thing with the
298000	300000	once again, ladies and gentlemen
300000	301000	we have a full flight
301000	302000	Oh, how did that happen?
303000	304000	And I'm so sorry
304000	306000	I'm so sorry for your full flight
306000	308000	Are you going to be okay?
309000	312000	And every fucking thing they say is once again
312000	314000	Just a reminder, once again
314000	317000	Because it's a subtle fucking technique to infantilize you
317000	320000	They're always implying that you're a fucking idiot
320000	323000	Once again, once again, once again, once again
323000	325000	Once again, folks, once again, we do remind you
325000	326000	We do have a full flight
326000	329000	Like, talk to me like a normal person
329000	331000	and what will be revealed is that you're shitty business
331000	335000	Like, stop, stop, stop talking to me like you're a teacher
335000	339000	You know, and then I haven't learned something about your fucking full flight yet
340000	342000	And then I go to my seat
342000	344000	It says, it says 6A
344000	346000	And it's in fucking coach
346000	349000	And I'm like, well, maybe their definition of a full flight
349000	350000	leaves a seat open next to me
350000	352000	Maybe they're doing one of those things where they
352000	354000	I'm like
354000	356000	And then this guy plows down next to me
356000	357000	And I'm like, what the fuck?
357000	358000	And he's like, who's this guy?
358000	360000	And then I was like, I guess
360000	362000	Maybe it was because I texted Steve
362000	363000	Just to make him feel bad
363000	365000	Who was on the plane
365000	366000	I was like, you're fired
366000	369000	Actually, I said, I said, you're fired as you walk by
369000	371000	So I think maybe for that reason
371000	373000	Steve, did you contact somebody on the
373000	375000	Did you tell somebody that I was
375000	376000	Okay, so that's what
376000	380000	So then the flight attendant comes by
380000	383000	And says, who's supposed to be in 1A?
383000	385000	Because we had, when we bought
385000	386000	Hey, I had a receipt
386000	388000	My boarding pass said 6A
388000	391000	But the receipt said 1A
391000	393000	And I said, oh, me, I
393000	395000	Yeah, and he said
395000	397000	We apologize, sir
397000	399000	But I'll pause it right there
399000	402000	That's not an apology
402000	403000	We have to stop doing that
403000	405000	Especially corporations
405000	407000	We apologize, sir, but
407000	409000	Yeah, you can't include sorry and but
409000	411000	In the same sentence ever
411000	413000	Sorry, but it's your fault
413000	414000	But I'm just saying
414000	418000	You can't narrate a theoretical apology
418000	420000	You can't say, Ria, I owe you an apology
420000	423000	I'm sorry, I spilled that thing on you
423000	425000	I owe you an apology
425000	427000	We'll fucking make it
427000	428000	Cash it
428000	429000	Yeah, I'd like to
429000	430000	Let's cash that sucker now
430000	432000	Because as my therapist told me
432000	435000	An apology is an acknowledgment of the offense
435000	436000	An expression of remorse
436000	439000	And a commitment to change
439000	440000	And without all three of those ingredients
440000	441000	It's not an apology
441000	445000	I'll take one, Delta, one of those
445000	448000	We apologize, but sometimes we downgrade
448000	451000	The aircraft and then sometimes when we do that
451000	453000	Sometimes this happens
453000	455000	That was his apology
455000	456000	That was his addressing of it
456000	458000	And he said
458000	460000	And if we had caught it on time
460000	462000	We could have done something
462000	463000	And I said, I don't
463000	465000	What does that mean?
465000	466000	I'm sorry
466000	469000	When we downgrade the craft
469000	470000	Sometimes this happens
470000	471000	And then when we
471000	472000	Sometimes this happens
472000	474000	I said, I heard you the far
474000	476000	But if we had caught it in time
476000	477000	What does that mean?
477000	478000	What caught it in time
478000	479000	It sounds like you have a disease
479000	481000	Yeah, it sounds like cancer
481000	483000	I think you have Delta cancer
483000	484000	Who's the we
484000	486000	I forgot there was people over here, sorry
486000	488000	I'll do this show like this for a little bit
488000	491000	Who is the we that's supposed to catch it in time?
491000	493000	Am I responsible for this?
493000	494000	Oh, no, no, no, Sarah, no
494000	496000	We apologize, but sometimes we downgrade the fight
496000	498000	He just kept repeating himself
498000	500000	And I was like, but what would you have done
500000	501000	If you caught it on time?
501000	504000	He's like, I'll offer you miles
504000	506000	And he said, Delta miles?
507000	509000	Do I look like a guy
509000	512000	To whom those are worth things?
512000	515000	I go, oh, Delta miles, my favorite
515000	519000	Like I'm cuckoo for Delta miles
519000	522000	I'm Delta rich
522000	524000	I get, honey
524000	525000	I don't have any money
525000	527000	But I have the equivalent of money
527000	531000	In opportunities to interact with Delta
531000	534000	A million Delta hours are coming
534000	536000	The thing is, the guy is standing
536000	537000	He knows what he's doing
537000	538000	That's the other thing
538000	541000	If you ever have a complaint on an airline
541000	543000	They have all the control
543000	546000	Because I can't sit in coach going
546000	549000	I'm too rich to be sitting next to everyone
549000	551000	With an earshot of me
551000	553000	There's been some kind of mistake
553000	554000	I can't do it
554000	558000	He's projecting his answers to me
558000	560000	In a way that I'm trying to murmur
560000	563000	And go, I'm too rich to be honest
563000	566000	And his answers are like, I'm sorry, sir
566000	568000	No, I'm sorry, he never said I'm fucking sorry
568000	569000	I got to stop
569000	570000	We apologize, sir
570000	572000	But one of the things that...
572000	574000	Everyone's story is just going to be
574000	576000	Oh, there's some prick up there
576000	578000	That doesn't understand downgrading very well
578000	580000	And keeps demanding things
580000	582000	And then it's just that
582000	584000	Because then the pilot's a big fan of community
584000	588000	And takes a selfie with me on the way out
588000	590000	And the flight attendants are like
590000	591000	Six seasons in a movie
591000	594000	And I'm like, you fucking suck, you fucking suck
595000	597000	Six seasons and some miles
597000	599000	Six thousand miles
599000	601000	And I'm like, I don't want your miles
601000	602000	I want my money back
602000	603000	Give me your money back
603000	605000	You know why that plane was downgraded?
605000	607000	You know it was because it was not full enough
607000	609000	And it's fucking like, I can't stand that shit
609000	611000	They don't give you your...
611000	614000	If you book an airplane ticket
614000	615000	God damn it
615000	617000	If you book an airplane ticket
617000	618000	And you don't show up
618000	619000	They keep your money
619000	621000	So why do they consider it a fucking crisis
621000	623000	To have an empty seat on their plane?
623000	624000	It's not
624000	625000	Like they're not losing money
625000	626000	You could fly
626000	627000	If everybody didn't show up
627000	629000	Fly the fucking empty plane over the ocean
629000	632000	And fucking keep your fucking money
632000	634000	You fucking cartel
634000	638000	You fucking horrible, horrible, horrible companies
638000	640000	And it's just like
640000	642000	They do everything they can to murder you
642000	644000	By taking you up in a metal tube
644000	647000	That should not be able to stay in the air
648000	650000	There's monsters on the wings
651000	653000	They keep denying it
655000	657000	Anyways, congratulations on your marriage
657000	658000	Thank you
665000	668000	I don't know why my straight marriage didn't work
668000	672000	I'm a delightful person to be around and travel with
673000	676000	Don't know why my wife would have left me
677000	680000	But I have a feeling she's probably in the arms of a woman right now
681000	682000	If she's smart
683000	684000	Let's see
684000	685000	Yeah, so
685000	687000	Fuck Pixar
687000	688000	I have a hair
688000	689000	Just because
689000	691000	The Golden Globes were tonight
691000	692000	And Anamalisa
692000	694000	My movie
694000	696000	That I executive produced
698000	699000	Thank you
700000	701000	I did a hell of a job
701000	703000	I executive produced the fuck out of that movie
704000	705000	It lost to
706000	708000	You know, M&M's in your head
708000	709000	Or whatever
712000	714000	The memory islands
714000	716000	But also memory marbles
716000	717000	Pick a lane
722000	723000	Are the islands made of marbles?
723000	724000	Are they powered by them?
729000	731000	Bing Bong felt a little lazy
736000	739000	First thought, best thought, I guess, on Bing Bong
740000	741000	Home by five
742000	743000	I'm just being bitter, I'm sorry
743000	745000	Of course, we all love Pixar movies
745000	747000	It's just tonight's not a very good night to love them
747000	749000	I don't know why everyone had to love them that much
749000	750000	They're doing fine
751000	754000	We made a fucking movie
754000	758000	About the futility of monogamy in a garage with Charlie Kaufman
759000	761000	Can't have a Golden Globe
763000	764000	I don't want your applause
765000	766000	Front row
768000	770000	They're just getting the vodka off their hands
770000	772000	And it keeps flying off my
772000	774000	It's a really bad night for you guys
774000	775000	I haven't trimmed my beard
775000	778000	And it's like really like wicking
778000	781000	And then it's just droplets are flying
781000	782000	So I'm really sorry
782000	783000	Just pretend you're at SeaWorld
786000	787000	Alright
787000	788000	Oh, so I want
790000	792000	So last night, that episode hasn't aired yet
792000	795000	But we had a young lady who had just
795000	798000	And I mean just gotten done with a double mastectomy
798000	801000	Come up on stage, she wanted to talk about it
801000	803000	And all I know
803000	806000	And she had done chemo
806000	808000	And she was still on the stuff
808000	811000	She was fresh off of the process
811000	815000	And was just sharing her story
815000	817000	And all I know as a guy is like
817000	821000	I only know, oh, it's so important that women talk about this
821000	823000	I totally know that
823000	824000	That's why I was so excited
824000	825000	But I had no idea what to ask her
825000	826000	It was the worst
826000	828000	I don't know if I did a good job or a bad job
828000	831000	Because she had just gotten done being sick
831000	832000	And it wasn't about me
832000	833000	So I couldn't be like
833000	834000	Am I doing a good job?
835000	836000	But I think I did anyway
836000	837000	And I was like
837000	838000	Am I supposed to be doing this different?
838000	839000	I was like
839000	840000	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
840000	842000	What's your relationship with your boobs before the end
842000	843000	I don't know what to do
843000	844000	I don't know what to do
844000	845000	I'm fucking everything up
845000	847000	And I tweeted at her
847000	849000	How did that go for you the next day
849000	851000	And I don't think she responded
851000	852000	And I don't
852000	854000	I may have done it wrong
854000	857000	Or maybe it doesn't revolve around you
857000	858000	And she needed sleep, Dan
858000	860000	She just got done with a fucking operation
861000	863000	But I don't know
863000	865000	Is there a connection?
865000	868000	You must have more friends than I do
868000	871000	That have been through breast cancer
871000	872000	I don't actually
872000	873000	Really?
873000	874000	No
874000	875000	I mean, you're going to tell me
875000	877000	You don't hang out with Tig Notaro all the time
878000	880000	Well, she did drive me here
881000	883000	It's by the Lesbian Shuttle Service
885000	886000	It's very convenient
886000	889000	There's got to be a great app name for that
890000	891000	Homeobile
893000	895000	It's not, no, that's not mine
895000	897000	That's a real thing that exists
898000	899000	Homeobile?
899000	900000	Yeah, Homeobile
900000	903000	It's like a ride-sharing service for
904000	905000	Hosts?
906000	908000	Prostitutes and drag queens
908000	911000	And people who specialize in body glitter and stuff
912000	914000	There's a lot of discrimination
914000	916000	In taxicab services
916000	917000	Oh, that makes sense
917000	919000	And they also don't like glitter and stuff
919000	920000	So a lot of
920000	922000	And so they really
922000	923000	They will
923000	924000	Apparently, you know
924000	926000	It's hard to get a cab when you're in drag
926000	929000	Is the discrimination because of the glitter
929000	931000	Or do you think it's like a cultural discrimination
931000	933000	I don't want that person in my car
933000	936000	I bet there's 16 people for which is just a practical concern
936000	939000	And everyone else that's probably just, you know
940000	941000	Intolerance
942000	944000	But for those people, there's
945000	946000	Pho-bo-mobile
948000	949000	Pho? Okay, yeah
949000	951000	They can drive each other around
954000	956000	They just used glitter Twitter
957000	958000	That was bad
958000	959000	It just rhymed
959000	961000	It wasn't a pun or anything
962000	963000	I just rhymed two words
964000	966000	But I guess the answer is you don't have to
966000	967000	There's nothing
967000	968000	There's another inappropriate
968000	969000	It wasn't my job
969000	970000	I was just like
970000	971000	It's just good
971000	972000	It's good for more women to talk about it
972000	973000	Totally
973000	974000	Because the alternative is
974000	975000	I mean, we're
975000	976000	I think this era is kind of
977000	978000	Like
978000	979000	More past ending
979000	980000	It's not like
980000	981000	Like
981000	982000	Like we get it now
982000	983000	Like women should talk about it
983000	984000	Because otherwise, like
984000	985000	The risk is like
985000	986000	People
986000	987000	Is what?
987000	988000	Is like women
988000	989000	Being so ashamed that they don't
989000	990000	Check themselves
990000	991000	Or don't seek treatment
991000	993000	Or just like don't
993000	994000	I mean
995000	997000	What is the risk of women not
997000	998000	Talking about it?
998000	1000000	What's the terrible thing that can happen?
1001000	1002000	All of it
1003000	1006000	I think it's women withering away in towers
1006000	1007000	You know, without anyone
1007000	1009000	Coming and talking to them
1009000	1011000	Just in our own tower by ourselves
1011000	1012000	Yeah, I don't know if it's literally
1012000	1013000	Like the thing that happens
1013000	1014000	Aging
1014000	1015000	Oh, I felt a lump
1015000	1016000	But I'm not going to tell anybody
1016000	1017000	Because my breasts are my
1017000	1018000	I don't know
1018000	1019000	I mean, that seems like
1019000	1020000	A very fifties thing
1020000	1021000	But
1021000	1023000	Or if it was ever anything
1023000	1024000	We can just blame everything
1024000	1025000	On the fifties
1025000	1026000	I don't know
1026000	1027000	I say blame delta
1028000	1029000	Or maybe it's more
1029000	1030000	For men's benefit
1030000	1031000	Maybe it's like
1031000	1032000	Women need to talk about it
1032000	1034000	Because men sexualize and objectify women
1034000	1035000	And it's like
1035000	1036000	We're like
1036000	1038000	Like we need to
1038000	1039000	Like the alternative would be
1039000	1040000	Men being like
1040000	1041000	Ew, gross
1041000	1042000	Like
1042000	1043000	Your boobs
1043000	1044000	Got the
1044000	1045000	Your boobs are sick
1045000	1047000	Your boobs got a cold
1047000	1049000	Your boobs used to be sick
1049000	1050000	But now they're sick
1053000	1054000	That's it
1054000	1055000	According to her
1055000	1056000	She sounds like
1056000	1057000	I don't know if this is
1057000	1058000	Lucky for her
1058000	1061000	Or if this is just the new
1061000	1062000	This is the advance of
1062000	1064000	Medicine or technology
1064000	1065000	That
1066000	1068000	That you can just
1068000	1070000	That you just basically end up with
1070000	1071000	I think like
1071000	1073000	A nice pair of fake boobs
1073000	1074000	Like because they take them off
1074000	1075000	And then they put in like
1075000	1076000	Like the bags
1077000	1078000	But somebody else told me
1078000	1080000	I had a friend who has a mother
1080000	1082000	Who went through this process
1082000	1084000	But maybe it was longer a goat
1084000	1085000	And she said
1085000	1086000	You know
1086000	1087000	They're just like
1087000	1088000	They're like mannequin boobs
1088000	1089000	And I was like
1089000	1090000	Boing
1095000	1096000	Why were you like that?
1099000	1100000	My penis became erect
1101000	1103000	So fast that it made a cartoon
1104000	1105000	Diving board
1106000	1107000	What's that sound?
1109000	1111000	I miss mannequins in films
1111000	1112000	Oh man
1112000	1115000	We just don't put mannequins in film and TV
1115000	1117000	As much as we used to in the 80s
1117000	1119000	What about the film mannequin?
1119000	1120000	You like that?
1120000	1121000	I mean I like that one
1121000	1124000	In my top three mannequin based films
1126000	1128000	Mannequin is definitely in my top three
1132000	1134000	But Kim Cottrell right?
1134000	1135000	Yeah of course
1135000	1138000	That's my favorite thing about lesbians
1138000	1140000	But also like Andrew McCarthy too
1140000	1142000	Because he's kind of a hot lesbian
1148000	1149000	God damn it
1149000	1151000	I want to talk about hot chicks with you
1152000	1154000	I know Andrew McCarthy is a hot chick
1158000	1160000	I was a kid and I saw that movie
1160000	1161000	And I was like
1161000	1162000	That guy's got a high voice
1162000	1164000	Like he's a leading man
1164000	1165000	Dreamy lady
1165000	1167000	He's pretty dreamy
1168000	1171000	And you know I'm sure
1171000	1174000	May Shack Taylor's performance is
1174000	1176000	Still heralded as progressive by
1177000	1179000	The gay community I'm assuming
1181000	1182000	Everyone on Homemobile
1182000	1183000	For sure
1183000	1184000	Loves May Shack Taylor's
1189000	1190000	I wonder if that must be a serious bummer
1190000	1192000	For actors who are like
1192000	1194000	Because culture advances so quickly
1194000	1197000	So then there's actors out there who are like
1197000	1201000	Oh I played gay guy number five in this thing
1201000	1204000	And then it's like 15 years later
1204000	1206000	And they must feel like
1206000	1207000	Man I got conned
1208000	1210000	I was told that I was doing a great job
1210000	1212000	And all this stuff
1212000	1214000	And now I feel like I'm part of the problem
1214000	1216000	And then they go to the library
1216000	1218000	And they just sit in the corner
1218000	1219000	And they eat peanuts
1220000	1222000	Just loudly eat peanuts in the library
1222000	1224000	And then his 80s style glasses break
1224000	1227000	And he can't read any of the books in the library
1227000	1229000	His 3D glasses
1231000	1233000	I was asking you in the green room
1233000	1236000	You haven't seen the Back to the Future documentary that I was in
1236000	1237000	Not yet
1237000	1240000	Where they tricked me into saying Back to the Future 2 and 3 suck
1240000	1242000	And then kept it in the documentary
1244000	1245000	Fine
1246000	1248000	I was at an airport and I rode
1248000	1252000	Down an escalator next to one of the guys that shot that interview
1252000	1253000	And he was like
1253000	1254000	Hey it's me
1254000	1255000	I shot that thing
1255000	1256000	And I was like
1256000	1257000	Oh hey
1257000	1259000	You guys really kept that thing in there huh
1259000	1260000	And he's like
1260000	1261000	Yeah but you know what
1261000	1262000	It's good
1262000	1263000	It's good
1263000	1264000	Yeah
1264000	1265000	People like it
1265000	1266000	Yeah
1269000	1271000	You can't just make something true
1271000	1274000	I mean I'm sure it's good for you guys to have a villain in your documentary
1278000	1279000	Because I said in the thing
1279000	1280000	And I was like
1280000	1281000	I said come on
1281000	1282000	I said
1282000	1283000	You know in 2 and 3
1283000	1284000	Come on
1284000	1285000	And he's like
1285000	1286000	What?
1286000	1287000	What?
1287000	1288000	And I was like
1288000	1289000	Come on don't make me say it
1289000	1290000	What?
1290000	1291000	Make you say what?
1291000	1292000	And I was like
1292000	1294000	I know that you're shooting a documentary that Zemeckis and Gayle are going to be in
1294000	1295000	They're my heroes
1295000	1297000	Don't make me say Back to the Future 2 and 3 sucked
1297000	1298000	And they put it in
1300000	1302000	And they put it in right before a whole chapter of the documentary
1302000	1305000	About how great Back to the Future 2 is
1305000	1307000	So they knew what they were doing
1307000	1309000	People love to hate me
1310000	1311000	And I look great in it too
1311000	1314000	I look like fucking Bigfoot
1318000	1319000	So not like now
1319000	1321000	Now you're like well groomed and handsome
1321000	1322000	I'm just telling you
1322000	1324000	It was a bad day if you watch it
1324000	1325000	I look like
1325000	1326000	I look like
1326000	1327000	I look like Matt Groening like
1327000	1328000	Like walked into a fan
1331000	1332000	I don't know how to fan
1332000	1333000	I said
1333000	1336000	The fan part's added so that Matt Groening doesn't get offended
1337000	1340000	I don't know what the effect of the fan is
1344000	1345000	By the way I'm not texting
1345000	1346000	No I can't
1346000	1348000	I realize you're here and I respect you
1348000	1349000	I'm looking at my notes
1349000	1350000	Do your thing
1351000	1352000	Okay so
1352000	1353000	Golden Globes highlights
1355000	1357000	The only thing I saw was
1357000	1360000	Denzel Washington got the Cecil B. DeMille Award
1360000	1362000	And during his speech he said
1363000	1365000	He started breaking up
1365000	1367000	And he started to cry a little bit I think
1367000	1368000	Right after he said this
1368000	1371000	So we'll never know what he meant
1371000	1372000	He said
1372000	1373000	I want to thank my mother
1373000	1375000	For convincing my father
1376000	1379000	To get higher than 25 watt bulbs
1382000	1383000	Because he thought
1383000	1384000	If they were lower wattage
1384000	1385000	We could save money
1385000	1386000	And then he started crying
1386000	1387000	And then he moved on
1387000	1389000	And then he was like done
1389000	1390000	We would never know
1391000	1392000	I care more about that
1392000	1394000	Than what Ricky Gervais said to Mel Gibson
1395000	1396000	That got blamed
1396000	1397000	Yeah
1398000	1399000	Do you know what he said?
1399000	1401000	He said what does sugar tits even mean?
1401000	1402000	I wasn't sure
1402000	1403000	I thought maybe I had insight and focus
1403000	1405000	I was texting people sitting at the Golden Globes
1407000	1409000	Which is why I know that Brad Pitt loves Anomalisa
1409000	1411000	And then he came and he was sitting at the table
1411000	1413000	With our guys
1414000	1416000	There was a chair available for him
1416000	1418000	Because Charlie left after we had lost
1418000	1419000	Aww
1423000	1425000	I think I'm probably not supposed to say that
1427000	1428000	I just think that's funny
1428000	1429000	That's funny
1429000	1431000	They're like Brad Pitt's sitting here in Charlie's chair
1431000	1433000	Where's Charlie?
1433000	1434000	He took off
1434000	1435000	He left
1436000	1437000	Charlie's gone
1439000	1441000	He likes Anomalisa
1441000	1442000	And that's cool because
1442000	1445000	He uses my beard in The Big Short
1449000	1450000	Yeah the 25 watt bulb
1450000	1452000	Oh my only theory was
1452000	1455000	Oh so did his dad get like a really
1455000	1456000	Like his mom said
1456000	1458000	You should get more than 25 watt bulbs
1458000	1459000	And his dad was like
1459000	1460000	Does this satisfy you?
1460000	1462000	And he got a big spotlight
1463000	1465000	And then little Denzel stood in
1465000	1466000	And it was like
1469000	1470000	It's show time
1471000	1472000	It's show time
1472000	1474000	I don't know if I have a Denzel impression
1474000	1475000	I thought I'd find out
1476000	1478000	It's show time
1479000	1481000	It's show time
1481000	1483000	It's show time
1486000	1488000	I'm Denzel Washington
1489000	1491000	I'm John Lithgow
1492000	1493000	John Lithgow
1494000	1495000	I'm John Lithgow
1495000	1496000	My mouth is a circle
1499000	1501000	You sound like John Lithgow
1501000	1503000	When you put your mouth in a circle
1504000	1505000	You don't look like him
1505000	1506000	But you sound like him
1506000	1507000	Sometimes
1514000	1516000	Okay well I got some gifts
1516000	1517000	Delta
1517000	1518000	Girls screaming
1518000	1519000	We were talking about girls screaming
1519000	1521000	In the green room
1521000	1523000	Yeah and how it happens to me all the time
1525000	1527000	Every time I enter a room
1527000	1529000	Girls start screaming
1530000	1532000	Because I was saying
1532000	1535000	You were saying your hotel was next to a playground
1535000	1536000	In San Francisco
1538000	1540000	And there were girls watching the football game
1540000	1542000	In the airport
1543000	1545000	And I thought there was an ISIS attack
1545000	1554000	Like girls from age 3 to 20
1554000	1558000	Will just shriek to express happiness
1559000	1561000	They won't even differentiate
1561000	1563000	It sounds like there's a murder happening
1563000	1565000	I was like my adrenaline
1565000	1566000	I was mad
1566000	1568000	Because I was sitting at the airport
1568000	1569000	I can't do an impression of it
1569000	1571000	It's a shrill thing
1571000	1573000	I thought ISIS was there
1573000	1575000	And then it was like
1575000	1576000	It's a fucking football game
1576000	1577000	And she's happy
1577000	1578000	She's winning
1580000	1582000	Grown men definitely
1582000	1584000	When you're little tiny tiny tiny kids
1584000	1587000	All kids just do the same things
1588000	1590000	Grown men, they do make these horrible sounds too
1590000	1592000	When they're watching sports
1592000	1594000	But they, for that
1594000	1597000	It's like you think there's a person who's about to hurt you
1597000	1600000	Like not that a person's about to get hurt
1600000	1601000	It's a single attacker
1601000	1602000	Yeah
1609000	1611000	I'm so happy
1612000	1613000	Dad!
1617000	1623000	And I made some of your favorite pulled pork sliders
1625000	1626000	I gotta stop doing that
1626000	1628000	My fucking throat is shredded
1629000	1631000	From shrieking at the football game, right?
1633000	1636000	You and I came to the same conclusion
1636000	1639000	Which is that it's because girls
1639000	1641000	It's not because girls are socialized to do that
1641000	1644000	It's because they're socialized to do so much other shit
1644000	1646000	That repress them
1646000	1649000	That when they're little kids on the playground
1649000	1651000	All they can do is scream
1651000	1652000	That's all they can do to affect
1652000	1654000	It's like yeah, it affects people
1654000	1659000	And it's like men start inheriting a planet
1659000	1663000	Where they can just throw chairs and like
1663000	1665000	Smash it! Smash it again!
1665000	1667000	And that is a sport
1669000	1670000	And women are just like
1670000	1672000	I'm gonna do that thing
1673000	1674000	It's my carry power
1676000	1678000	Everyone flies against the wall
1679000	1681000	Yeah, women
1682000	1685000	What can we do? Scream
1685000	1688000	Good luck being married to one
1690000	1693000	It was my fault that I was married
1694000	1695000	My wife is a hero
1696000	1697000	She got away
1699000	1700000	She got away
1703000	1705000	Fuck a pig's hour
1705000	1707000	Brad Pitt lives on Annalisa
1707000	1709000	Mestectomy, wedding
1709000	1711000	Leah Thompson Airport
1711000	1713000	Denzel Flight 25 bulbs
1713000	1716000	Oh and they were showing the real
1716000	1718000	The Denzel Washington reel to give him his award
1718000	1720000	But they were like
1720000	1723000	They were showing all those little phrases and things
1723000	1725000	But then they were like showing
1725000	1728000	They show him flying the plane upside down
1728000	1729000	It wasn't like
1730000	1732000	It was kind of funny
1732000	1733000	Like what an actor
1735000	1736000	It's amazing
1736000	1738000	Remember when he flew that plane upside down
1739000	1741000	They were just showing the plane
1741000	1742000	Then hits his head
1742000	1745000	Then they just cut to him getting knocked unconscious
1745000	1748000	Like he's so good at getting knocked unconscious
1748000	1750000	I'm pretty sure
1750000	1753000	They really should have shown him doing all those lines in that movie
1753000	1755000	The lines blow at the end of them
1755000	1757000	Did you like that movie?
1757000	1759000	I was very affected by that movie
1759000	1762000	I thought it was the best alcoholic movie
1762000	1763000	That I've ever seen
1763000	1765000	It's not like the whole like Jekyll and Hyde
1765000	1767000	Like oh you're such a terrible person when you're drunk
1767000	1768000	That's why you should quit
1768000	1769000	Because it seems like well that's common sense
1769000	1771000	And then people don't relate
1771000	1772000	But that was like the first movie I ever saw
1772000	1775000	It was like no I'm great at my job when I'm drunk
1775000	1777000	I save lives when I'm drunk
1777000	1778000	Fantastic
1778000	1780000	I still should quit drinking
1780000	1783000	And it's up to me because I will get away with anything
1783000	1784000	For the rest of my life
1788000	1790000	It got to me
1795000	1797000	It really got to me
1797000	1799000	Yeah okay so
1799000	1802000	Let's get to the gift portion of the
1802000	1804000	Our friend Michael
1804000	1807000	Michael do you want to come up here so you can
1807000	1809000	You brought me a couple of gifts
1809000	1810000	Where's the
1810000	1812000	You brought me like a
1812000	1814000	They got him back in the green room
1814000	1815000	Someone could bring him up
1815000	1816000	Can you bring that big box out?
1816000	1817000	On their way
1817000	1818000	This is very nice
1818000	1819000	Thanks Steve
1822000	1826000	I knew what it was through the wrapping
1826000	1828000	And I thought I'd open it out here
1828000	1830000	Got to use comic book paper
1830000	1831000	Mic drop
1831000	1832000	Sorry about that
1840000	1843000	For the podcast it's a leg shaped object
1846000	1865000	I know there's no replacing Old Faithful
1865000	1867000	No yeah and I found it
1867000	1868000	It was a heart breaker
1868000	1869000	I found out the
1869000	1870000	I found the thing
1870000	1871000	Because I looked at
1871000	1872000	One of the writers suggested
1872000	1874000	Why don't you look on this mannequin leg you keep
1874000	1876000	Watching about and see if there's a model number
1876000	1877000	Or whatever on it
1877000	1880000	And it was
1880000	1882000	Carol Barnhart displays
1882000	1884000	Incorporated and I found their catalog
1884000	1886000	And I found Old Faithful
1886000	1889000	I found my plastic mannequin legs
1889000	1891000	There's a whole career making those things apparently
1891000	1892000	Someday
1892000	1894000	How do you mean?
1894000	1896000	Well Carol whatever
1896000	1898000	There's a whole name
1898000	1900000	There's a whole group of people making mannequin legs
1900000	1901000	Apparently
1901000	1902000	Branding
1902000	1903000	Get into that
1904000	1907000	But I guess she went out of business
1907000	1909000	No one's picking up the phone
1909000	1912000	It was ringing and I was kind of relieved
1912000	1913000	That no one picked up
1913000	1916000	Because it's like here we go again
1916000	1917000	This conversation
1917000	1918000	But I would have had it
1918000	1919000	I would have been like
1919000	1923000	Is 197B available?
1923000	1925000	I'll take two bent and one straight
1925000	1926000	But no they're gone
1926000	1927000	They're gone
1927000	1928000	I found this on eBay first
1928000	1930000	And then I found a phone number
1930000	1932000	And it was like a place in El Monte
1932000	1933000	And I was like
1933000	1934000	Oh do you have
1934000	1935000	It's like I don't
1935000	1936000	I don't know what the part number is
1936000	1937000	And it's like
1937000	1938000	Oh well is it
1938000	1939000	M-N-189
1939000	1940000	Color?
1940000	1941000	I was like
1941000	1942000	Oh
1942000	1943000	I'm speaking your language
1946000	1948000	That's how you got that mannequin leg?
1948000	1949000	Yep
1949000	1950000	Shit
1950000	1951000	You could just
1951000	1952000	Okay
1952000	1955000	I had to go to a physical place
1955000	1957000	Wait what do you mean you had to
1957000	1958000	Oh wait no I can't talk about that
1958000	1959000	I found the physical place
1959000	1960000	No I tried
1960000	1962000	Me and Steve have been trying
1962000	1964000	Trying to get a replacement leg
1964000	1965000	Aww
1965000	1968000	With toe articul- not articulation but you know
1968000	1969000	With toes
1969000	1970000	With toes
1970000	1971000	With toes
1971000	1973000	We went to the swap meet like this week
1973000	1975000	And we walked it backwards
1975000	1976000	I mean there was a mannequin
1976000	1978000	But I mean the toes weren't separate
1978000	1979000	Yeah
1979000	1983000	There's a lot of caveats in mannequin work
1983000	1985000	You go to a mannequin thing
1985000	1986000	And you're like
1986000	1987000	Oh I want a leg
1987000	1988000	And they're like
1988000	1989000	We got legs
1989000	1990000	Yeah
1990000	1991000	And I'm like
1991000	1992000	You don't have legs
1992000	1993000	I know I've seen legs
1993000	1994000	And they're like
1994000	1995000	We got legs
1995000	1996000	But they're just for sandals and shoes
1996000	1997000	Like they don't have
1997000	1998000	They don't have articulation
1998000	1999000	And then
1999000	2000000	It was just a weird
2000000	2001000	Weird situation
2001000	2002000	They took me up to the
2002000	2004000	The mannequin graveyard
2004000	2005000	Which is where
2005000	2006000	Prop
2006000	2007000	Prop buyers
2007000	2008000	For horror movies come
2008000	2009000	And pick up like
2009000	2010000	Shitty ratty
2010000	2011000	Creepy looking mannequins
2011000	2013000	Because that's a good half of the business
2013000	2015000	Apparently of mannequins
2015000	2017000	Is simply props
2017000	2018000	For horror movies specifically
2018000	2019000	Not horror movies
2019000	2021000	Like that probably represents
2021000	2023000	75% of all mannequin uses
2023000	2024000	But yeah
2024000	2025000	I mean horror
2025000	2027000	Horror films use all sorts of these mannequins
2027000	2028000	There's all these guys
2028000	2030000	They are fabricating mannequins
2030000	2031000	And I was like
2031000	2032000	This seems easy
2032000	2033000	You can just make me one, right?
2033000	2034000	And they're like
2034000	2035000	Well not so fast, Junior
2035000	2036000	And I had to go to like
2036000	2037000	A back office
2037000	2038000	And meet someone's dog
2038000	2040000	And like sit in front of her on a
2040000	2041000	P.E.F.
2041000	2043000	Let's go through the mannequins guild first
2043000	2044000	Let's get this straight
2044000	2046000	Meanwhile, across the street
2046000	2049000	A guy has a shopping cart full of AK-47s
2049000	2050000	Just going down an aisle
2050000	2051000	Oh, I need grenades!
2051000	2052000	Grenades!
2055000	2057000	I think that's the cover of The New Yorker
2057000	2058000	Just described
2058000	2060000	Oh, by the way, Rhea
2060000	2062000	When I masturbate
2062000	2063000	I rub a mannequin leg
2063000	2065000	With hosiery on it on my nipple
2065000	2066000	Got it
2068000	2069000	Makes total sense
2070000	2071000	And I had one
2071000	2074000	It was a 1983 Carol Barnhart display model
2074000	2075000	Apparently I don't know
2075000	2076000	Which is vintage
2076000	2077000	What did somebody
2077000	2079000	Did somebody yell something out?
2079000	2080000	Oh, okay
2080000	2081000	Okay
2082000	2083000	My mom's ghost
2086000	2087000	Oh fuck, my mom died
2090000	2091000	I should call my dad
2092000	2094000	I think I just murdered my mom with my mind
2096000	2097000	Oh god, dad's down there
2097000	2099000	I guess the house burnt down
2100000	2101000	Oh
2102000	2103000	Muffin
2104000	2105000	Oh, lucky
2105000	2106000	The pets are going
2108000	2110000	Oh, my brother was visiting
2123000	2125000	It was a vintage thing
2125000	2126000	And it was a nice foot
2127000	2128000	Great foot
2128000	2129000	It was rubbing on my nipple
2130000	2131000	Not to offend Michael
2131000	2132000	But these are a dime a dozen
2134000	2136000	I thought you would laugh at that
2137000	2139000	I didn't think you'd take it really seriously
2139000	2140000	Not offensive
2141000	2142000	No, it's very thoughtful
2142000	2143000	I'm going to try it
2143000	2144000	I'm going to try to
2148000	2149000	Nothing's going to stop you now
2151000	2152000	I mean, when I saw it
2152000	2156000	I was like, it's probably not as cool as the vintage one
2157000	2158000	But I mean, it didn't
2158000	2159000	I mean, it didn't look terrible
2160000	2161000	If you have an opportunity
2161000	2163000	To buy a mannequin part
2163000	2164000	Like, just go for it
2164000	2166000	I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
2166000	2168000	Yeah, you're going to need it eventually
2168000	2169000	Yeah
2169000	2172000	I mean, it is more of like a third lizard wife type of a
2174000	2175000	Mannequin leg
2175000	2177000	But that could be the most joyful one
2177000	2178000	Absolutely
2178000	2180000	Because, you know, you already tried to fix people
2180000	2181000	For the first two
2181000	2182000	Now you're just sailing through
2182000	2183000	Now you're mannequin leg
2183000	2184000	You're just like, let's be honest
2184000	2185000	With each other
2185000	2186000	Let's just be honest
2186000	2187000	Let's just do this thing
2187000	2188000	And the mannequin leg's like, I love that
2188000	2190000	Have you ever seen legs lavish?
2190000	2192000	Legs lavish, the YouTube site?
2192000	2193000	Yeah, the YouTube channel?
2193000	2197000	Yeah, that was my spot
2199000	2200000	I mean, you were asked
2200000	2201000	I was referencing you
2201000	2202000	Okay, all right
2202000	2204000	All right, you're weird
2206000	2207000	That's me saying that
2207000	2208000	I'm wearing overalls though, you know
2208000	2210000	But I'm trying to be MC John, you know
2210000	2211000	You also got
2211000	2212000	Oh, I didn't realize that
2212000	2213000	Oh, that's nice
2213000	2214000	I thought that was
2214000	2215000	San Diego
2215000	2216000	San Diego
2216000	2217000	All right
2217000	2218000	Yeah, that's fantastic
2218000	2220000	Also, you brought beer
2220000	2221000	Well, should we all
2221000	2222000	I brought some home brew
2222000	2224000	He brought home brew beer
2224000	2225000	Can somebody grab it
2225000	2226000	Because it was chilling in the fridge
2226000	2227000	In the fridge
2229000	2230000	Where beer goes
2230000	2231000	Are you a beer person?
2231000	2232000	I am not a beer person
2232000	2234000	I no longer drink
2234000	2236000	Why'd you stop?
2236000	2238000	Because I got too good at it
2241000	2242000	Because I nailed it
2244000	2245000	Retired
2245000	2246000	I finished drinking
2247000	2248000	I did it all
2250000	2251000	Are you comfortable talking about it?
2251000	2252000	Oh, totally
2252000	2253000	Yeah, I talk about it on stage
2253000	2254000	Did you have like blackouts
2254000	2256000	And you were like a troubled drinker
2256000	2257000	Yeah, I mean
2257000	2260000	I realized that when I got really good at vomiting
2260000	2262000	There was a problem
2262000	2263000	That I could hide it
2263000	2265000	And I was totally comfortable puking
2265000	2266000	I was just like
2266000	2267000	Oh, this is a problem
2268000	2270000	Steve, e-hill
2271000	2273000	She just grabbed it
2274000	2275000	And ran out
2275000	2276000	Like the Phantom of the Opera
2278000	2279000	And I take the leg with me
2282000	2283000	Thank you
2284000	2285000	I'm a little jealous in some respects
2285000	2286000	Of people that
2287000	2289000	I'm too much like Denzel in flight
2289000	2290000	I could just keep doing it forever
2290000	2291000	Yeah, just do it forever
2291000	2292000	And I will eventually die
2292000	2293000	Because I won't
2294000	2295000	So far I don't like
2296000	2297000	I'll black out while drinking
2297000	2299000	But I won't wake up in blood
2299000	2302000	And I don't typically have
2302000	2305000	Like super bad stories happen to me and stuff
2305000	2306000	Which means I can keep doing it
2306000	2307000	But I'm like
2307000	2309000	I can tell I'm slowly rotting my brain away
2309000	2310000	Like because I'm just like
2310000	2312000	So able to drink all the time
2312000	2313000	But you know
2313000	2317000	It's a medication for a sickness called You People
2320000	2321000	This is like
2321000	2323000	Like super smart juice for you
2326000	2327000	What else is going on?
2327000	2329000	What's the deal with this beer, huh?
2329000	2330000	Right
2330000	2331000	It was broad
2331000	2332000	Searching for more vodka
2332000	2333000	But we couldn't
2333000	2334000	Okay, so you had warned me
2334000	2335000	You're still getting the carbonation
2335000	2336000	Yeah, they
2336000	2338000	I just always have to
2338000	2339000	I always throw that out
2339000	2340000	Yeah
2340000	2341000	I don't suppose you have an opener
2341000	2343000	Oh, shit
2343000	2344000	I have a lighter
2344000	2345000	Front row
2345000	2346000	He's got one
2346000	2347000	I came with him
2347000	2349000	How do you lighter people do the lighter thing?
2349000	2351000	It's hard, man
2351000	2352000	It's a fulcrum
2352000	2353000	It's a fulcrum
2353000	2354000	Well, I know the principle
2354000	2355000	But I just don't
2355000	2356000	I've never been able to do it
2356000	2358000	I'll demonstrate it for you
2358000	2359000	Oh, shit
2360000	2361000	Well, let's hope he succeeds
2361000	2362000	Am I right?
2362000	2363000	Can you make sure
2363000	2364000	Is there a camera
2364000	2365000	The stakes couldn't be higher
2365000	2366000	We're doing it for this camera
2366000	2367000	Is he on it?
2367000	2369000	Yeah, the one with the red light, yeah
2369000	2370000	Oh
2370000	2371000	The thing like
2371000	2372000	You really
2372000	2374000	You want it there as firm as possible
2374000	2376000	And then you just
2376000	2377000	Oh
2377000	2378000	Heads up
2378000	2379000	Whoo
2379000	2380000	Watch out
2386000	2388000	But I really don't know what you did
2388000	2389000	What is firm
2389000	2390000	It was that
2390000	2392000	That downward angle, yeah
2392000	2394000	Shove it in hard there
2394000	2396000	That was close
2396000	2397000	I heard something
2397000	2399000	But I think that's just because you bottled it
2401000	2403000	I didn't mean he's bad at bottling
2403000	2405000	I just meant like it's probably
2405000	2407000	You know, it's probably harder with a store bought
2407000	2408000	There you go
2408000	2409000	Almost
2409000	2410000	One more
2410000	2411000	One more
2411000	2412000	One more
2415000	2416000	It hurts
2417000	2418000	Oh
2419000	2420000	That's the thing, man
2421000	2422000	Leverage
2422000	2423000	Yes, love
2424000	2425000	Hand up higher
2427000	2429000	If you show me, then you do it
2432000	2433000	I'm a big boy
2435000	2436000	Show me
2437000	2438000	Wait
2445000	2446000	See
2446000	2449000	For the podcast, they're failing to open a bottle
2451000	2452000	Okay
2453000	2454000	Okay, I mean you
2454000	2455000	All right
2456000	2458000	You want this part of your thumb
2458000	2460000	Like close to the cap
2460000	2462000	Oh, the thumbs part of it
2462000	2464000	That's the fulcrum
2465000	2467000	I thought the bottle was the fulcrum
2468000	2469000	It's the thumb
2469000	2470000	Oh, my God
2470000	2472000	It was the thumb the whole time
2472000	2473000	That's why it hurts
2473000	2474000	I'm gonna
2475000	2476000	I'm gonna have to
2481000	2482000	I loosened it
2485000	2486000	All right, thank you, Michael
2486000	2487000	Do you want to talk about this beer?
2487000	2488000	You brewed it yourself
2489000	2490000	Um, sure
2490000	2492000	You said it's asahi, sort of a
2492000	2493000	Yeah, like asahi
2493000	2495000	Like asahi, that A-S-A-H-I
2495000	2498000	That company that sells really light beer
2498000	2500000	They have a Japanese beer that they make
2500000	2501000	That's dark
2501000	2503000	And my buddy went to visit
2503000	2505000	And they brought some back, so
2505000	2507000	For New Year's, this is my New Year's beer
2507000	2509000	That is the darker version
2509000	2510000	Uh, called
2511000	2513000	So velly velly asahi
2513000	2515000	So so asahi
2515000	2516000	Yeah
2516000	2518000	Why, how is it like asahi?
2519000	2521000	What did you do to make it like asahi?
2523000	2524000	Let's move past it
2524000	2525000	It's a
2526000	2527000	It's a clone
2528000	2530000	How do you clone an asahi?
2530000	2531000	By taste
2531000	2533000	I mean, any beer you can
2533000	2535000	You can figure out what's in it by taste
2535000	2536000	So it's not a clone
2536000	2537000	It's a
2537000	2538000	It's a
2538000	2539000	Like you just tried to reinterpret it
2539000	2540000	Yeah
2540000	2541000	Okay
2541000	2543000	That's more impressive than just like
2543000	2545000	I mean, finding a recipe to me
2545000	2546000	Yeah
2546000	2548000	Yeah, if you have the complete recipe, though
2548000	2549000	Like, you could be like
2549000	2551000	Oh, well, this is wrong because of this
2551000	2553000	If you're just making up a recipe
2553000	2554000	Right
2554000	2555000	Yeah, it's
2555000	2556000	I mean, it's
2556000	2557000	It's more experimental, certainly
2557000	2558000	Yeah, definitely
2558000	2559000	To do it by taste
2559000	2560000	Definitely
2560000	2561000	Engaging
2561000	2562000	Alright, so this is a
2562000	2563000	This is the
2563000	2564000	Okay
2567000	2569000	Why'd you bump it on the podium?
2569000	2570000	Time and place
2570000	2571000	That's how I cheers
2571000	2572000	Okay
2572000	2573000	Fair enough
2573000	2574000	Like this moment
2575000	2576000	And this place
2577000	2578000	I don't know
2578000	2579000	Oh
2579000	2580000	That's how I learned to cheers
2580000	2581000	I'm into it
2581000	2582000	I like learning
2583000	2584000	Well, it's yummy
2584000	2585000	Thank you
2586000	2587000	I'm getting woozy
2591000	2592000	No
2592000	2594000	I guess the joke was that he
2594000	2595000	Uh, drugged me
2595000	2597000	You know, a lot of people make that joke
2597000	2598000	I don't know
2598000	2600000	I guess it's just easy to make
2600000	2601000	It's the overalls
2601000	2602000	I think pro
2603000	2604000	Yeah, it was a
2604000	2605000	It was a Farmer John
2605000	2606000	He
2606000	2607000	I decided the Farmer John thing
2607000	2608000	Empty John
2608000	2609000	I was just like
2609000	2610000	I thought it'd be
2610000	2611000	I thought it was there
2611000	2612000	It's L.A.
2612000	2613000	We just assumed
2613000	2614000	We were just like
2614000	2615000	I thought he wears those
2615000	2616000	Yeah
2617000	2618000	I had to call
2618000	2619000	I had to call probably
2619000	2620000	11 places
2620000	2622000	To find overalls though
2622000	2623000	Well, the 11th try
2623000	2624000	This is a good celebration
2624000	2625000	Of my 43rd birthday
2625000	2627000	Which was January 3rd
2627000	2628000	We didn't have a show
2630000	2632000	Thank you very much, Michael
2633000	2634000	Thank you for the leg
2635000	2636000	I will think about you
2636000	2637000	While I'm using it
2640000	2641000	Well, I mean
2641000	2642000	It's Los Angeles
2645000	2646000	What's the new leg's name?
2647000	2648000	I never named the legs
2648000	2649000	But if you
2649000	2650000	Uh, Sophie?
2651000	2652000	It's a great choice
2660000	2661000	Yeah
2662000	2663000	You got
2663000	2664000	You got some Algonquin
2664000	2665000	Roundtable
2665000	2666000	Whit tea
2667000	2668000	I'll pop in
2668000	2669000	I'll pop in every now and then
2669000	2671000	Rhea, Rhea, Rhea played
2671000	2673000	Uh, with us on Harmon Quest
2673000	2675000	Uh, coming soon to CISO
2675000	2677000	In Spring 2016
2677000	2678000	And, uh, you had
2678000	2679000	You had a
2679000	2680000	You had a real burner in there
2680000	2681000	Oh, yeah
2681000	2682000	I really like
2682000	2683000	Like, like
2683000	2684000	Fruit flies like a banana
2684000	2685000	Kind of just like
2685000	2686000	Just like
2686000	2687000	That was fast
2687000	2688000	Like, like your
2688000	2689000	Your wordplay
2689000	2690000	Thank you
2690000	2691000	It's a skill
2691000	2692000	Yes
2692000	2693000	I don't have
2693000	2694000	And, by the way
2695000	2696000	I invited Cameron
2696000	2697000	To do this first
2697000	2699000	And then she donated her wife
2699000	2700000	But it was only because
2700000	2701000	You were in the
2701000	2702000	Harmon Quest show
2702000	2703000	Totally
2703000	2704000	I think, really
2704000	2705000	I mean, I
2705000	2706000	You're, you're my favorite
2706000	2707000	I'm, yes
2707000	2708000	I mean, I know that
2708000	2709000	And I'm going to go home
2709000	2710000	And tell her that
2710000	2711000	No!
2714000	2715000	Uh, alright, so
2715000	2717000	For our next segment
2718000	2719000	Did Ridley ever show up?
2719000	2720000	Nah, he's beat
2720000	2722000	He's a piece of shit
2723000	2725000	He like, fucking stranded me
2725000	2726000	Yeah
2726000	2727000	I got a text message
2727000	2728000	Justin Roiland
2728000	2729000	Is he here?
2729000	2730000	Nah
2730000	2731000	Nah, let's not get the hopes up
2731000	2732000	I invited him
2732000	2733000	And he's, he's watching
2733000	2734000	Making a Murderer
2736000	2737000	What's he saying?
2737000	2738000	What's he saying about
2738000	2739000	Like, a Stephen Avery
2739000	2740000	Holy fuck this show
2740000	2741000	Jesus Christ
2741000	2742000	Do people not know
2742000	2744000	That cops are bad sometimes?
2744000	2745000	Like, why is that
2745000	2746000	Still shocking?
2746000	2747000	Yeah, but that shit's crazy
2747000	2748000	Well, again
2748000	2750000	I, I keep saying this lately
2750000	2751000	But Philadelphia Police
2751000	2752000	Bombed a neighborhood
2752000	2754000	To kill a bunch of black people
2754000	2755000	Like, not
2755000	2756000	Yeah, not funny
2757000	2758000	It's something that happened
2758000	2759000	It's horrifying
2759000	2760000	But that was the 70s
2760000	2762000	Those black people were scary
2764000	2765000	We didn't know what they were
2765000	2766000	Gonna do
2768000	2769000	They were, they were
2769000	2770000	They were making disco
2773000	2774000	Parliament, there was a guy
2774000	2775000	With a diaper
2775000	2776000	It was like
2776000	2777000	Funk music?
2777000	2778000	Who calls music funk?
2778000	2779000	You're a guy with a diaper
2779000	2780000	So they were unpredictable
2780000	2781000	And I'm not, I'm not
2781000	2782000	I'm not saying we should
2782000	2783000	Have bombed them
2786000	2789000	It was, you know
2789000	2790000	Yeah, I didn't know that
2790000	2791000	You told me that
2791000	2792000	Because I was like
2792000	2793000	Are you sure you said firebomb
2793000	2794000	They firebombed because they thought
2794000	2795000	There were some Black Panthers
2795000	2796000	In that neighborhood
2796000	2797000	Something like that, yeah
2797000	2798000	Which, I mean
2798000	2799000	Why would that make it okay?
2799000	2800000	I know
2800000	2801000	And the reason that conversation came up
2801000	2803000	Of course, is because of these dudes
2803000	2804000	Oh, yeah
2804000	2805000	We gotta talk about
2805000	2806000	About that list
2806000	2807000	The ones you guys are calling
2807000	2808000	Y'all-cada on
2810000	2811000	On Twitter
2812000	2813000	They, they, they
2813000	2814000	Updated their list of
2815000	2816000	You probably
2816000	2817000	I tweeted it and
2817000	2819000	Or Spencer tweeted it and I retweeted it
2819000	2820000	I told Spencer about it
2820000	2821000	Spencer tweeted it
2821000	2822000	While I was still talking about it
2822000	2823000	Spencer
2823000	2824000	I really got in there
2824000	2826000	Under the, under the buzzer
2826000	2827000	Do you, do you have the
2827000	2828000	I can't, I can't
2828000	2829000	I can't get a firebomb
2829000	2830000	Yeah
2833000	2835000	The last thing I saw was they wanted
2835000	2839000	The American girl doll Molly to come back
2841000	2842000	Wait, is that a
2842000	2843000	It's a joke
2843000	2844000	Oh, okay
2845000	2846000	Because, because the list
2846000	2847000	That's my wish
2847000	2848000	And I was just putting it in
2848000	2849000	As one of theirs
2849000	2851000	The list has stuff like really
2851000	2853000	A specific model of radio from Walmart
2853000	2855000	Like they really want the Walmart one
2855000	2857000	Which is like adorable kind of
2857000	2858000	But then you're mad
2858000	2859000	And I'm like
2859000	2860000	But it also has
2860000	2863000	Miracle, miracle whip and mayonnaise
2863000	2865000	Like right above each other
2865000	2866000	Well, I'm from Ohio
2866000	2869000	And so I can completely understand that
2869000	2871000	Because sometimes you want the tangy zip
2871000	2872000	Of miracle whip
2873000	2875000	And sometimes you simply want mayonnaise
2875000	2876000	Understand what
2876000	2877000	I understand
2877000	2878000	When are those times
2878000	2879000	When you don't let the tangy whip
2879000	2880000	All the other times
2883000	2885000	Do people in Ohio just get scared
2885000	2886000	That they're gonna
2886000	2888000	They're gonna taste for too much good things
2888000	2889000	Too fancy
2889000	2890000	In their mayonnaise
2890000	2892000	I don't want all that spice in there
2892000	2893000	Whenever I make food for my family
2893000	2894000	They're like, I don't know
2894000	2895000	There's a lot of spice in there
2895000	2896000	I'm like, it's pepper
2897000	2900000	It says miracle right on the jar
2900000	2901000	I don't think we should be
2901000	2902000	Cracking this open that often
2902000	2903000	This is Ohio
2904000	2905000	Take it easy
2905000	2906000	I looked at it
2906000	2907000	And I just assumed it was like
2907000	2910000	They couldn't quell a civil war
2910000	2912000	Between them on that topic
2912000	2913000	They're like, guys, guys, guys
2913000	2914000	Bigger fish
2915000	2917000	How are we gonna take out the government
2917000	2919000	We can't settle this dispute
2919000	2920000	I got the list if you want it
2920000	2923000	Alright, well, give us some highlights
2923000	2926000	Well, I think my favorite is definitely
2926000	2929000	Just the word aprands four inches
2929000	2930000	Yeah, four inch aprands
2931000	2934000	They have Kepler elves at their place
2934000	2936000	Making mayonnaise cookies
2939000	2941000	I just, I mean, I guess they must have
2941000	2942000	Multiple people writing the list
2942000	2945000	Because they have like hot dogs
2945000	2946000	And then they have brats
2946000	2948000	And then they have markers
2948000	2950000	And then later on they have paper
2950000	2952000	And chisel tipped markers
2952000	2954000	It's just, it's weird
2954000	2956000	It sounds like they're gonna have a science fair
2956000	2959000	Oh, potatoes, wires
2959000	2961000	This is my school
2961000	2962000	Small light bulb
2962000	2963000	D-cell batteries
2963000	2965000	Queen size bed sheets
2965000	2966000	Twin size bed sheets
2966000	2968000	Pillow cases
2968000	2969000	I don't know what they're trying
2969000	2970000	Yeah, white queen size
2970000	2972000	That seems too specific
2972000	2973000	Yeah, that's very
2973000	2975000	How many beds are in that outpost, right?
2975000	2976000	Well, they also want tampons
2976000	2979000	And like a lot of 100 cigarettes
2979000	2981000	Well, tampons makes a lot of sense
2981000	2982000	Well, I didn't know
2982000	2984000	They were allowed to have girlfriends
2984000	2985000	Aren't they supposed to be holed up
2985000	2987000	And like taking over the government
2987000	2989000	Or defending themselves from it?
2989000	2991000	Well, they're not gay or anything
2993000	2995000	They could just have, they could just
2995000	2997000	Girlfriends just came and they're like
2997000	2998000	We miss you
2998000	2999000	And they're like get in here
2999000	3000000	And now they're just like
3000000	3002000	Amy needs tampons
3002000	3006000	And some basic 100s stat
3007000	3009000	And the list is so disorganized
3009000	3010000	Because I guess they were like
3010000	3011000	Putting it together
3011000	3012000	And somebody was like
3012000	3013000	Well, can we at least alphabetize this?
3013000	3014000	And they're like
3014000	3015000	Hey, what the fuck do you think
3015000	3016000	We're trying to get away from around here?
3017000	3020000	Well, maybe we should make a president to the list
3020000	3023000	And he should collect a list tax
3024000	3026000	Okay, Steve, point taken
3026000	3029000	We'll get Miracle Whip and mayonnaise
3031000	3033000	Oven Cleaner is on this list
3033000	3034000	Oven Cleaner?
3034000	3037000	Why does that a priority to anyone ever?
3039000	3041000	Like they're roughing it, right?
3041000	3045000	My favorite one is throw rugs for doorways
3046000	3049000	Throw rugs any and all size for doorways
3049000	3051000	But really, doorway size
3053000	3054000	Not any and all size
3054000	3056000	How many doorways are in this thing?
3056000	3057000	Jesus, ice scrappers?
3057000	3058000	What does that mean?
3058000	3059000	Ice scrappers
3060000	3063000	Why can't you spell, I guess it's just a shopping list
3063000	3065000	They probably didn't proofread it
3066000	3069000	It's weird because they have a lot of half-formed thoughts
3069000	3072000	Like sugar and flour, but they're not doing anything
3072000	3075000	How can you think scrappers spelled with two P's
3075000	3080000	I mean, because how does that person think you spell scrapper with three P's?
3083000	3085000	Well, scrapper's just a thing
3085000	3087000	It's not a word you spell
3087000	3088000	Right
3090000	3093000	It's not a word used by people that spell a lot
3093000	3094000	You don't write it down
3094000	3096000	It's not something scrappers do
3096000	3098000	They don't do a lot of spelling
3098000	3099000	Scrappers just exist
3099000	3101000	They ain't no word or nothing
3103000	3108000	You got, who here isn't through Making of a Murderer yet?
3109000	3110000	Sorry
3111000	3114000	All our little, yeah, thanks for holding up the show, everybody
3115000	3120000	Can't talk about it, little spoiler allergists
3121000	3123000	Well, it's fucked up, that's all I can tell you
3124000	3125000	It's fucking crazy
3127000	3129000	But in Death of a Salesman, he dies
3132000	3133000	That I can tell you
3134000	3135000	How does he die?
3136000	3137000	Too many sales
3140000	3141000	He oversells
3142000	3143000	He oversells
3143000	3146000	He sells everything and then there's nothing left
3146000	3149000	And he looks at himself and then the lights go down and you hear
3149000	3152000	A gunshot and a cash register
3155000	3158000	And then you hear God saying, just what I wanted
3159000	3164000	But if you stay until after the credits, God returns it
3165000	3167000	And then he's just like, it's like fire in the sky
3167000	3168000	He's like naked and sucking his thumb
3168000	3169000	He's like, what happened?
3171000	3173000	And then someone comes by and says, are you okay?
3173000	3174000	And he goes, yeah
3174000	3176000	And they go, here, have some soup
3176000	3177000	And he's like, what is soup?
3177000	3179000	And they're like, it's soup from a store
3179000	3180000	He's like, what is a store?
3180000	3181000	It's a place where you get products
3181000	3183000	Who gives them to them? Salesman
3183000	3186000	I like this job, Salesman
3187000	3188000	I will be a Salesman
3189000	3191000	And then credits
3191000	3192000	More credits
3194000	3196000	But then if you stay long enough
3196000	3198000	He's getting out of Salesman school
3199000	3201000	And they're like, good job
3201000	3202000	You're going to be a Salesman now
3202000	3203000	And he's like, I hope I'm a good one
3203000	3204000	I'm going to live forever
3204000	3206000	And then he goes home
3206000	3208000	And he gets a beer out of the fridge
3208000	3212000	And you hear an off-screen voice say, oh, you think you're going to live forever, huh
3213000	3215000	And he turns and Sam Jackson's in his kitchen
3216000	3219000	And he's like, Salesman's going to live forever
3220000	3223000	This shit just got started, motherfucker
3225000	3226000	And then he hands him a list
3226000	3228000	And he's like, ice scrapper
3230000	3231000	The hell is that?
3231000	3232000	That's right, motherfucker
3232000	3233000	I can't do Sam
3233000	3235000	Who can't do Sam Jackson?
3235000	3237000	I love that continental Samuel Jackson
3237000	3239000	That's right, motherfucker
3240000	3241000	Because I'm trying to like
3241000	3244000	That was like Kate Blanchett, Samuel Jackson
3244000	3247000	That is right, motherfucker
3248000	3249000	Therese
3251000	3253000	It's on my white guilt cockpit
3253000	3255000	The altimeter for like racist
3255000	3257000	I actually said, I don't want to make him sound
3257000	3260000	If I can't do an impression of him and nail it
3260000	3261000	Then I'm just racist
3261000	3263000	I just sound like a crazy racist
3263000	3265000	Like a black accent
3265000	3266000	I'm not going to do that
3266000	3268000	So I'm like, I'm trying to do Sam Jackson
3268000	3270000	But I'm not going to risk it
3270000	3272000	So then I'm just giving him this tremolo
3272000	3275000	Like a fucking opera singer voice
3275000	3277000	That's right, motherfucker
3278000	3279000	That's beautiful
3279000	3280000	And then everyone's driving home
3280000	3282000	And they're like, boy, that Dan
3282000	3283000	She sure isn't racist
3288000	3289000	Why do you say that, honey?
3289000	3290000	Well, didn't you notice that
3290000	3292000	He can't even do Sam Jackson very well
3292000	3295000	I mean, the man sounds like
3295000	3296000	If you did a good impression of him
3296000	3297000	You'd sound racist
3297000	3299000	Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right
3299000	3300000	That's pretty crazy
3300000	3301000	He just made him sound
3301000	3303000	He made him sound like Cate Planchett
3303000	3305000	Do you want to stop in Arby's?
3306000	3308000	Yeah, I guess
3308000	3310000	I mean, is today our cheat day
3310000	3311000	Or are we taking it tomorrow?
3311000	3314000	Well, the last week we did Friday
3314000	3315000	I figured we could do Thursday tonight
3315000	3316000	Is tonight Thursday?
3316000	3318000	We just saw Harman Town
3321000	3323000	Every night is Thursday
3323000	3325000	Oh my God, there's a head in the sky
3326000	3328000	Pull over, throw a crowbar at it
3328000	3330000	It's a miracle whip
3332000	3334000	I am miracle whip
3336000	3339000	I will make your species tangy
3340000	3341000	Forever
3342000	3344000	No more mayonnaise
3345000	3347000	I don't know why I'm looking at my phone
3348000	3349000	I'm kind of scared
3349000	3351000	I went through a list of things to talk about
3353000	3355000	I don't think I have any lesbian questions left
3356000	3358000	What was the wedding like?
3358000	3360000	How is the process, is this offensive?
3360000	3363000	How is the process of planning a wedding?
3363000	3366000	Sure, well we got fitted for our Birkenstocks together
3372000	3373000	In October
3373000	3377000	No, we just had it at a venue that we performed at
3377000	3378000	So that was super fun
3378000	3381000	It's like a little house type venue in Chicago
3381000	3382000	It's called The Hideout
3382000	3384000	And we got married there
3384000	3385000	Are you guys both from Chicago?
3385000	3388000	Cameron's from Chicago, I'm from Akron, Ohio
3388000	3390000	Yeah, we already knew you were from Ohio
3390000	3392000	I don't retain anything
3392000	3393000	It's fine
3394000	3397000	I just stand up here and sweat and try to get away with things
3401000	3403000	Here's my final lesbian question
3403000	3404000	Yes
3404000	3407000	Do you ever wish that I saw you as something other than a lesbian?
3407000	3408000	No
3408000	3409000	Okay, good
3410000	3413000	I'm a lesbian first and everything actually
3415000	3418000	I am nothing if not a lesbian
3419000	3421000	You showed me in the back, you have a t-shirt
3421000	3424000	You got it at a gas station that says zero to lesbian in 60 seconds
3424000	3425000	That's pretty good
3426000	3428000	I love that T
3429000	3432000	It's not a bald spot, it's a solar panel for a lesbian machine
3432000	3433000	Yeah, exactly
3433000	3434000	I liked that one
3434000	3435000	Yeah
3435000	3436000	Lesbaholic
3436000	3437000	Yeah
3437000	3438000	It's just chocoholic
3438000	3442000	If you're reading this, the woman that I really love and respect has fallen off of my motorcycle
3443000	3445000	Please help her now
3457000	3459000	That's funny
3465000	3466000	Lesbian t-shirts
3467000	3468000	They're great
3469000	3470000	Alright
3473000	3474000	Thank you
3475000	3476000	Thank you
3476000	3477000	Thank you
3478000	3479000	Hello
3480000	3481000	How are you?
3483000	3484000	What?
3485000	3488000	Oh, CSO is live right now
3488000	3489000	You should watch it
3489000	3492000	And Harman Quest comes to it in the spring
3492000	3495000	Thank you, thank you, thank you, plug finger
3498000	3499000	What's it coming to Canada?
3499000	3500000	Plug finger
3503000	3506000	I don't know
3506000	3507000	I'm awful sorry about that
3507000	3511000	I'm always the last person to know when there's like regional chicanery
3511000	3514000	I believe that's just because the old studios
3514000	3516000	You know, the Universal's at the top of this
3516000	3519000	And Sony was at the top of the Yahoo thing
3519000	3520000	A lot of people got mad at Yahoo
3520000	3521000	But you should not have
3521000	3522000	That's Sony stuff
3522000	3524000	That is why you couldn't watch
3524000	3526000	It didn't play everywhere
3526000	3529000	Because they have these really, really, really old school deals carved out for like
3529000	3531000	different parts of the planet and stuff
3531000	3535000	It's like going back to like the history of these studios
3535000	3539000	I don't get it
3539000	3541000	I don't know why they don't want to change that
3541000	3544000	I was like really, I was so excited when Yahoo thing was happening
3544000	3547000	Because I was like, oh my god, we're going to just be able to count clicks
3547000	3550000	And just fucking get an honest number of how many people like the show
3550000	3552000	And I was like, oh no, it's like
3553000	3554000	It's very frustrating
3554000	3556000	But yeah, and I didn't know CSO was the same way
3556000	3558000	Or if it is or whatever
3558000	3560000	But I got nothing to do with it
3560000	3561000	Just move to America
3561000	3564000	Like all these immigrants are doing
3566000	3570000	Got to build a wall around the thing
3570000	3573000	The Donald Trump stuff
3575000	3579000	Looks like Bernie Sanders and Hillary are tied in whatever the thing is there
3579000	3580000	That people care about
3580000	3583000	The elections? The polls?
3583000	3587000	I don't know, like the polls in Iowa or something like that
3587000	3589000	Oh, probably
3589000	3592000	Whatever the latest data is
3592000	3595000	She's feeling the burn
3595000	3597000	She should be
3597000	3599000	It's not, yeah, I don't know
3599000	3602000	They have only boring thoughts about politics
3602000	3607000	Like the fact that if there's like a neck and neck thing going on in the Democratic Party
3607000	3610000	Because he's running as a Democrat, so is she
3610000	3613000	And then Trump, is he running as a Republican?
3613000	3614000	He's running as a Republican, yeah
3614000	3619000	The Republicans have made him do sign promises and do pinky swears
3619000	3623000	That he's going to abide by all Republican and doctrine and stuff
3623000	3624000	It's really ridiculous
3624000	3627000	I don't know, have they done that before?
3627000	3629000	Because it's been kind of funny
3629000	3632000	The kinds of things that they're trying to control Donald Trump with
3632000	3635000	I guess it's not that funny
3635000	3639000	Well, if it is, you'd have to get specific before they laugh
3639000	3641000	No, I'm not blaming them at all
3641000	3643000	Don't get me wrong
3644000	3647000	You can't just allude to a pie fight that happened
3649000	3651000	Well, apparently you can
3652000	3653000	I can
3653000	3654000	Okay
3654000	3655000	I'm a storyteller
3655000	3657000	Yeah, again, not blaming them
3658000	3660000	Yeah, well, I haven't been following because I'm getting scared
3660000	3663000	So, I mean, isn't the basic fact that if he's running as a Republican
3663000	3666000	And there's nobody even close to him and they're all terrified of him now
3666000	3667000	And now we have these two people
3667000	3669000	Is it going to be another one of those things?
3669000	3672000	But Sanders has said that he won't split the ticket
3672000	3673000	He'll back out
3673000	3676000	Yeah, and Obama's not been endorsing either candidate
3676000	3679000	I mean, I don't think the people who like Bernie Sanders are like
3679000	3683000	Oh, it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump for me
3684000	3688000	So when one of them loses, they'll switch over
3688000	3691000	And it'll be great
3693000	3697000	No, but the idea is that it's Bernie Sanders or...
3697000	3700000	Yeah, I mean, that's what they don't both run
3701000	3703000	Bernie and Hillary, you know, that's the thing
3703000	3705000	Oh, you mean in the general election?
3705000	3707000	Yeah, when the rubber meets the road
3707000	3709000	If they were to somehow split the ticket
3709000	3712000	Like if you were to go off and run like a nadir
3712000	3716000	Yeah, I don't think that people run as nadirs these days seriously, do they?
3716000	3719000	No, Bernie Sanders is Ralph Nader
3720000	3724000	Well, he's in the Democratic ticket contest right now
3724000	3727000	Like if we get past that point and then he's still going
3727000	3729000	Now I'm going to run as an independent or something
3729000	3730000	I don't think that's going to happen
3730000	3732000	But if it did, that'd be a possible thing
3732000	3734000	But I don't think that's likely either way
3734000	3736000	But I mean, everyone's talking about that
3736000	3739000	You know, him presenting a strong challenge to Hillary
3739000	3743000	Is only going to make her seem more, you know, a better candidate
3743000	3746000	Because she's actually fighting against a real competition
3746000	3749000	See, boring political thoughts
3749000	3751000	But it's getting kind of important
3751000	3753000	It's always kind of important
3753000	3756000	And this guy, this Hitler man is still running
3756000	3758000	It's really scary
3758000	3763000	Well, no, the real fear is that fucking Ted Cruz is the one that's hiding behind his shoulder
3763000	3766000	Is everyone's going to be like, oh great, we got rid of Donald Trump
3766000	3768000	Now we have Ted fucking Cruz
3768000	3770000	Are you kidding me?
3770000	3771000	I mean, he...
3771000	3772000	Go with this
3772000	3774000	I mean, this is a reference no one gets
3774000	3777000	But like trans-metropolitan, like they had these political...
3777000	3779000	My guy was wrong
3779000	3781000	We're in the back of a comic book store after all
3781000	3782000	But like he's the...
3782000	3784000	Ted Cruz is the fucking smiler
3784000	3785000	Like he doesn't...
3785000	3789000	He was a political candidate who was like invented by an institution
3789000	3790000	He doesn't have a past
3790000	3793000	And he doesn't believe in anything like at all
3793000	3795000	He's even said as much
3795000	3799000	And in the debates, he gets a lot of steam and attention for saying
3799000	3802000	I'm going to dismantle journalism
3802000	3804000	He gets fucking applause for talking about
3804000	3807000	He's going to destroy the freedom of the press
3807000	3808000	Like it's fucking insane
3808000	3809000	Like I don't...
3809000	3812000	Donald Trump is like, I'm going to fuck my daughter
3812000	3815000	But it's not like I'm going to fuck my daughter
3815000	3817000	And no one can talk about it ever
3817000	3820000	Like he's just a raging asshole
3820000	3821000	But raging assholes...
3821000	3823000	It's not really his platform to be fair
3823000	3825000	I mean, it's just his wish list
3825000	3826000	You can't pretend like...
3826000	3829000	You can't be both following and not following politics
3829000	3832000	That's one of his central planks, is fucking his daughter
3832000	3833000	If elected, I...
3833000	3834000	In the Oval Office
3834000	3835000	Throw me a chicken in every pot
3835000	3838000	And I will fuck my daughter in every home
3838000	3841000	He's going to take his daughter into every home and fuck her
3841000	3842000	Oh, okay
3842000	3843000	Sorry, everybody
3843000	3844000	I got off track
3844000	3845000	But I mean, I don't know
3845000	3847000	Donald Trump is like a crazy asshole
3847000	3852000	But I feel like a crazy asshole believes that he's like doing good stuff
3852000	3856000	And might actually, deep down, have real principles at heart
3856000	3859000	But I don't think Ted Cruz has displayed anything other than
3859000	3863000	A baseless desire for power
3863000	3866000	And utter lack of principles
3868000	3869000	Boring political thoughts
3870000	3871000	I'm really...
3871000	3874000	I'm really, really terribly unfamiliar with the guy entirely
3874000	3875000	I wouldn't be...
3875000	3876000	If he was standing in front of me, I wouldn't be able to...
3876000	3877000	I don't even...
3877000	3878000	I've never even seen a picture of him
3878000	3881000	Well, if you saw him, you wouldn't want him to be anywhere near you
3881000	3883000	Or people you cared about
3883000	3884000	He looks like...
3884000	3885000	Yeah, I've talked about this
3885000	3887000	He looks like he does bad stuff to kids
3889000	3890000	Does he really...
3890000	3891000	I mean...
3891000	3894000	So he has a comb over and a patchy beard?
3895000	3897000	Yeah, again, I've talked about this before
3897000	3899000	I also made passing reference to the fact that I
3899000	3901000	As someone who looks like a child of a monster
3901000	3905000	Know when someone looks like a child of a monster
3907000	3908000	It's a real...
3908000	3910000	It's like my version of gaydar
3913000	3915000	Only it's just based on looks
3915000	3916000	Yeah
3917000	3918000	Isn't this...
3918000	3919000	That's not how gaydar works
3919000	3922000	If all gay people looked like Rip Taylor
3922000	3925000	Then everyone would have gaydar
3926000	3927000	You might be right about that
3928000	3930000	What do you think, gay community?
3930000	3934000	Do you have political thoughts?
3934000	3936000	Do you care about politics?
3936000	3938000	I care about politics, but I just...
3940000	3942000	I want Hillary to run
3942000	3945000	But I feel like it's crazy that I'm like a woman in 2016
3945000	3947000	And I'm like scared to say that
3947000	3949000	Because so many people are like
3950000	3952000	We did a show in San Francisco
3952000	3953000	And we're like
3953000	3955000	Just off the cuff said Hillary
3955000	3956000	Not even talking about her
3956000	3958000	And the whole room was like
3962000	3964000	It's just amazing to me that there's a female candidate
3964000	3965000	And people were like
3965000	3967000	No, no, we have a socialist old white guy
3967000	3968000	So we're going with him now
3968000	3971000	She's gonna have to wait 20 more years
3972000	3976000	I mean, is it just that she's a woman?
3976000	3978000	No, I think she's capable
3978000	3980000	I know that she has made bad choices
3980000	3981000	Here's the thing
3982000	3985000	She wasn't always on board with gay rights in the government
3985000	3986000	But also like
3986000	3989000	Hey, my family wasn't always on board with gay rights
3990000	3991000	Until I talked to them a bit
3991000	3992000	And they were like
3992000	3993000	Oh, okay, now I get it
3993000	3994000	I'll go with that
3994000	3996000	Even you yourself probably
3996000	3997000	Oh, yeah, yeah
3997000	3998000	I was like
3998000	3999000	I'm not gay
4000000	4002000	For like 20 years
4005000	4008000	Happens to the best of us, Hillary, I understand
4009000	4011000	Well, I mean, but keep going
4011000	4012000	Because I don't really know anything
4012000	4013000	Like, sell me on her
4013000	4015000	And I'm not unsold on her
4015000	4016000	But I'm just like
4016000	4017000	Now's your chance
4017000	4018000	You got a pulpit
4018000	4019000	Sure, I mean, I have
4019000	4020000	It's 9-11
4020000	4021000	It's a perfect time to do it
4022000	4023000	Oh, yeah
4024000	4026000	Well, as we all know, Hillary was
4026000	4028000	Here are some other things you should never forget
4028000	4032000	Hillary was the mastermind behind 9-11
4032000	4033000	And brought
4033000	4034000	No, I don't know
4035000	4036000	I just
4036000	4037000	No, I'm kidding
4037000	4038000	It's a joke thing
4038000	4041000	She voted to change the melting point of steel
4041000	4042000	Yes, she did
4046000	4048000	She keeps trying to lower it
4055000	4056000	No, you don't
4056000	4057000	I'm just
4057000	4058000	I'm totally curious
4058000	4059000	Like, I'm not
4059000	4061000	Sure, I mean, my position is just that
4061000	4064000	It's America and it's 2016
4064000	4065000	And it's time to have a female president
4065000	4068000	And I think she's more than qualified to do the job
4068000	4070000	And, like, she could be better
4070000	4072000	But every candidate could always be better, you know?
4072000	4074000	So that's how I feel about that
4075000	4077000	Outside my depth, I don't have enough
4078000	4082000	If anyone calls me up to the carpet to explain any of it
4082000	4083000	I won't have anything to back it up
4083000	4087000	But maybe I'm reflective of all of America in that regard
4089000	4092000	Because none of us have time to, like, research any of this shit
4092000	4094000	But it just seems like she's a little
4094000	4097000	Like, she's very effective
4097000	4098000	And a little
4098000	4105000	Like, she seems like she's on the right side of, like, left-ness
4105000	4106000	Like, she's very
4106000	4111000	She's a little kind of conservative-y
4111000	4113000	That's what
4113000	4114000	Yeah, you don't care
4114000	4115000	You're the same fucking woman
4115000	4117000	I'm tired, I just want
4119000	4122000	Do you think that'll change the national psyche at a fundamental level?
4122000	4123000	Obviously
4123000	4124000	I do, actually
4124000	4126000	Electing Donald Trump will change the fucking national psyche
4126000	4128000	Yeah, like, it's really poorly
4128000	4132000	I mean, I don't think that, obviously, electing Barack Obama didn't fix everything
4132000	4135000	But I do think that on a long enough timeline
4135000	4141000	Like, something that Chris Rock actually said in a Rolling Stone interview, like, affected me a lot
4141000	4143000	In that he was talking about his kids, and he was like,
4143000	4148000	My kids are growing up knowing from the time that they were children
4148000	4151000	That a black man has been the president of this country
4151000	4153000	And they will not think the other way
4153000	4156000	Like, they don't think the way that we think in this room
4156000	4158000	Because we weren't kids
4158000	4161000	And so that is just in their brains, and that's how they're going through the world
4161000	4165000	So I think that as children for boys and girls
4165000	4170000	And everyone on the gender spectrum, to see a woman in the White House
4170000	4172000	Would be an effective change for this country
4172000	4175000	To see women as equals that can do the same jobs as men
4175000	4177000	Yeah
4178000	4180000	It would put a woman
4180000	4183000	I guess, like, Obama's getting such a bad fucking
4183000	4187000	Like, it was such a shitty time to become president
4187000	4189000	Absolutely, I mean, he had a Congress that was like,
4189000	4191000	No, on everything, no matter what he did
4191000	4197000	And then he just, like, you know, it took us 20 years to realize that Jimmy Carter wasn't a pariah
4197000	4199000	Because it was just put in our heads
4199000	4200000	He was a bad president
4200000	4203000	He just spent his term handcuffed
4203000	4205000	And, like, he couldn't do anything
4206000	4209000	And, like, me the most important thing, though, is personality
4209000	4211000	Because I'm too jaded
4211000	4215000	I just feel like we're electing a person that's going to speak for the country
4215000	4218000	At fucking holiday parties
4219000	4222000	They're going and meeting oil sheiks
4222000	4226000	And walking around and being in newspapers and saying stuff
4226000	4231000	Like, I don't really believe in the system enough to think that the president has more of a job than that
4231000	4234000	But that's the thing, is, like, when you look at that job description
4234000	4238000	Look what JFK did, look what Roosevelt did
4238000	4243000	The other one, not the guy with the pith helmet, the guy in the wheelchair
4249000	4252000	You know, you can create a whole national psyche
4252000	4256000	So if she was, like, elected
4256000	4260000	And then she was, like, walking around and she was kind of badass just in terms of swagger
4261000	4265000	I do think that would be good, beneficial for everybody
4265000	4268000	Whether they realize they're benefiting from it or not
4268000	4272000	I don't know if I trust her to have that swagger
4272000	4276000	Like, Obama talks like a fucking game show host, he's amazing
4276000	4280000	Like, listening to his fucking soothing voice and his lack of
4282000	4285000	After eight years of that fucking potato
4286000	4289000	I want to not care about politics
4289000	4292000	Just be like, every time that guy opened his fucking mouth, he was like
4292000	4293000	I peed a poo poo
4293000	4297000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry to the fucking retarded people, I'm sorry about that
4299000	4301000	My sister's retarded
4301000	4303000	You need to deal with it
4303000	4305000	She gave me a pass
4305000	4308000	She looked into my eyes and she said, no, I'm not gonna do it
4313000	4315000	He's gonna gervaze, he's gonna gervaze
4320000	4323000	Anyways, her personality
4323000	4327000	If we started this conversation and I said, I don't like her personality
4327000	4332000	You might walk away going, yeah, her personality is that she has a vagina, that's what you don't like
4332000	4335000	But, like, we're ending the conversation that way because you
4339000	4342000	I would love a woman president, I just like, I don't
4343000	4352000	She's like, her speeches, her fucking like, she's like
4353000	4355000	Gotta uterus
4355000	4357000	No, I'm just kidding
4357000	4359000	It's not true, I swear to god
4360000	4363000	I mean, if she was just more bubbly and had some pop-ups, I mean
4364000	4367000	I like all kinds of women, you know, like
4368000	4371000	Miss May, Miss October
4372000	4375000	There's a woman every month that I just like, I really approve of
4375000	4380000	No, but I wanted to be Margaret Thatcher, you know, even though it's like
4380000	4383000	You ask British people, are you fucking insane?
4383000	4388000	But it's like, I just mean in terms of like, you know, like, have a woman
4388000	4393000	It's like, we eventually put on a coin and then we call like, old iron fucking butt
4396000	4400000	To get away from those, like, dichotomies and stuff
4400000	4404000	And it was like, oh, we had a fucking, like, badass, like, like, ruler
4404000	4409000	That issued us into a world of like, like, like, exploring space
4409000	4413000	And like, reducing our prison population and like, things turned around
4413000	4419000	And that, it would be great to have a, just as with a ship, to have a woman at the front of that
4419000	4422000	Going like this, like those ships
4422000	4425000	Yeah, but with a lesbian t-shirt on
4425000	4427000	Yeah, like, I'm up here
4427000	4429000	Hot shells, yeah, exactly
4430000	4434000	Hillary's coin would say, I'm up here
4438000	4442000	Anyways, but yeah, the truth is, I mean, I fully, fully admit
4442000	4445000	I have no fucking nothing, like, because I'm just kind of disgusted by the whole thing
4445000	4452000	Like, every time I start getting into politics, I always, I just like, within the first five minutes
4452000	4455000	I'm like, this is so gross, this is so gross
4455000	4464000	Like, I just want, like, I'm an anarchist, like, I just want, I want that guy that landed the helicopter on the Congress lawn to that mailman with all the letters
4464000	4466000	I want him to be president
4466000	4476000	And I want that guy that said, you know, that lessig guy that says, like, like, vote for me and I will make campaign, I'll call for campaign reform and then quit
4476000	4481000	And then whoever's my vice president can take over and you can impeach him if you want
4481000	4488000	But, like, there will be a mandate, because 85% of the country, including conservatives, it's a bipartisan issue
4488000	4491000	Like, everyone wants campaign reform, I just can't imagine
4491000	4496000	Even, I will, I will honestly say it's more important than global warming campaign reform
4496000	4502000	Because it encompasses everything, because we're, we're still, so far, the biggest country in the world
4502000	4506000	Like, like, doing the biggest, making the biggest effects on the world
4506000	4511000	We have the biggest chance of getting China to stop, like, pumping fucking smoke into the sky
4511000	4518000	And we can't get our shit together unless we stop intermingling capitalism with politics
4518000	4520000	It just has no place in it, it's insane
4520000	4525000	It's like, it's like the idea that in order to run for president, you have to have billions of dollars
4525000	4528000	It's like fucking, we're so fucked because of that
4528000	4531000	And all we have to do is pass, like, one law or do something
4531000	4535000	No you don't, it works, shut up you jaded fucking Redditor
4537000	4539000	I'm jaded here
4539000	4543000	It used to be, like, illegal to spend money on a campaign, I think
4543000	4550000	Like, back in George Washington's day, like, I think you really couldn't spend money making the case that you should be president
4550000	4555000	And to the point it's gotten today, it's just astonishing to think about that, you know
4555000	4558000	Citizens United, Jesus Christ
4558000	4560000	I mean, that shit is so fucked up
4561000	4564000	Yo, it's gotten so much more fucked up
4564000	4568000	Also, what happened to all these anti-trust laws they made us learn about in high school
4568000	4577000	Why the fuck, who just merged now and fucking, like, fucking, mobile Exxon and fucking Time magazine merged or something
4577000	4580000	Like, I can't remember, it was like, what, those companies merged?
4580000	4584000	What the fuck in the goddamn monopoly fuck, what the fuck
4584000	4590000	Like, they used to, the idea, I remember when the phone company got too big and people panicked and had to break them up
4590000	4595000	Yeah, now we have businesses that are too big to fail so we gotta keep them, we gotta keep them around
4595000	4598000	We gotta keep them not failing
4598000	4601000	It's the exact opposite of busting a trust
4601000	4604000	Yeah, that's when I get boring because it's like, everyone said it before
4604000	4611000	It's like, we're all going like, because they fucking, that's the big short, like, takes that dark turn and it goes, like, they knew, they knew the whole time
4611000	4617000	We were asking ourselves if they were stupid or if they were stupid but they were evil and they were just confident in the government
4617000	4620000	They would bail them out and make poor people pay for everything
4620000	4623000	Fucking, god damn it, I'm gonna eat a dick
4623000	4626000	I'm so mad I'm gonna eat a dick
4626000	4629000	Old iron butt
4629000	4633000	I'm gonna, I'm gonna put a, I'm gonna put a, I'm gonna put a
4633000	4640000	Like, can you imagine, like, a welder at work and it's like, hey, did you hear what, did you hear what the Chancellor of Germany said to
4640000	4649000	said to, uh, at the UN and then, uh, and then, uh, Hillary said what she said back and it was like, yeah, she told him to do this thing
4649000	4651000	Our president's awesome, that'd be great
4651000	4654000	And then he goes back to welding and he's like, I love women
4654000	4656000	Yeah, that's what I'm saying
4656000	4662000	Like, he wouldn't go home and hit his wife because he'd be like, it was so hard welding today and my dad hit me so
4662000	4666000	And then he'd see his wife's face and he'd be like, you look like the president
4667000	4671000	Just, just make me a sandwich
4676000	4678000	You, you guys' reactions
4678000	4681000	Miracle whip this time
4681000	4683000	It's a special night
4683000	4687000	I like, you guys really disapprove of that welder
4689000	4692000	Just what Canada's doing, man, we gotta figure it out
4692000	4696000	Uh, what, you just stay north of a successful country and fucking
4700000	4703000	I fucking trumped you
4708000	4711000	Alright, get up here, Canada, if you want, if you want
4712000	4714000	Canada, expert
4715000	4716000	Alright
4716000	4720000	He's got, he's got, well, no, yeah, tell, let's talk about Canada
4720000	4722000	I like that, five parties, that sounds good
4722000	4723000	No, man
4723000	4724000	How does the voting work?
4724000	4725000	Uh, well, okay
4725000	4726000	Oh, what's your name, sorry
4726000	4727000	Sorry, my name's Adam
4728000	4731000	Uh, apologies to people who don't like anyone named Adam, but that's what's happening
4732000	4738000	Uh, I was just gonna make a joke about how the voting starts once everyone's apologized to each other
4738000	4741000	But then you apologized for your name, so
4742000	4744000	And it's the first name ever
4745000	4749000	It's like the least, the least offensive name anyone could ever have
4749000	4751000	It's the one God named the first
4752000	4754000	I'm the first person
4754000	4755000	Sorry
4756000	4760000	No, in Canada, shit is totally different because we don't vote for a president, man
4760000	4764000	We vote for, like, our individual, like, representatives
4764000	4769000	Like, if there was a senator, the senator would go off to Washington
4769000	4773000	And then all the senators from all the individual parties would get together and talk to everybody and be like
4773000	4775000	Here's what our party believes
4775000	4779000	And there would be all the different parties and, like, the fucked up thing is imagine there was, like, a Texas party
4779000	4783000	Because we have the Quebec party, and they all, they get tons and tons of votes
4783000	4786000	Imagine there's, like, a Texas party and they control, like, a third of it
4786000	4792000	And then there's, like, the conservative party, which is, like, way more left-wing than your guys is, like, left-wing party
4792000	4793000	And we hate them
4793000	4798000	And then, uh, we have our, like, left-wing party, which is doing okay now, and then the middle party, which is, like
4798000	4800000	Eh, let shit happen
4800000	4804000	And everyone gets elected, they get a certain number of seats, and then they divide it up
4804000	4806000	And whoever has the most gets to run the place
4806000	4808000	And nobody leaves a tip
4808000	4810000	No, no, 15 percent
4810000	4811000	Really?
4811000	4813000	Yeah, 15 percent, man, that's pretty standard
4813000	4815000	Or if you don't, you say, sorry
4815000	4820000	Wait, you tipping, I thought, I thought you didn't tipping, I thought tipping wasn't customary in Canada
4820000	4825000	And that's why, like, waiters and bartenders, like, they complain about Canadians, Canadian tourists
4825000	4827000	Have you not been tipping in Canada?
4827000	4829000	Jack, I tip everywhere
4829000	4832000	Tossing toonies all over the place
4832000	4833000	Yeah, man
4833000	4835000	Is it toonies or loonies?
4835000	4837000	All loonies and twos
4837000	4840000	We're gonna get a $5 coin, and then shit's gonna get real confusing
4840000	4846000	No, I really thought that, I don't know, and I also wouldn't be surprised if you said, oh, in, uh, in this, uh, fucking, what do you call them?
4846000	4849000	Uh, uh, uh, procedurals, what are your, uh, territories?
4849000	4851000	I don't know, yeah
4851000	4855000	Um, because I thought, where did I get that from, the, the, the tipping thing?
4855000	4858000	Has that, has that, has that changed, or has that been forever or 15%?
4858000	4859000	I think it's Europe
4859000	4864000	I don't know, no, no, no, yeah, when I went to Europe, I was trying to give people money, and they were like, oh, we don't do that here
4864000	4865000	And it was really confusing
4865000	4867000	Some people are genuinely offended
4867000	4871000	Like, like, like, like, like, they feel like you're saying, like, that you can own them, or something
4871000	4872000	Like, like, like, but
4872000	4877000	No, it's included, like, their bosses, like, don't, don't take tips, we're gonna pay you more
4877000	4882000	And it, like, uh, there's, there's a big argument, what's that guy, uh, Adam explains different Adam
4882000	4886000	And, uh, he, he has a thing where Adam shits on this thing
4886000	4887000	Adam ruins everything
4887000	4888000	Adam ruins everything!
4888000	4889000	That's the guy, he has the tip
4889000	4890000	Sorry, that was rough
4890000	4891000	Apologize
4891000	4892000	I apologize
4892000	4893000	I'm very sorry to everyone
4893000	4897000	Uh, yeah, he had a thing about tipping that was very accurate, and, uh
4897000	4899000	Well, will you, will you do it for us?
4899000	4902000	Will you, will you say, say, say the word about?
4903000	4904000	About
4904000	4905000	Uh
4908000	4910000	Are you faking? Are you faking?
4910000	4913000	Nah, I listen to too much American television
4913000	4914000	Uh
4914000	4916000	Do you want me to say it properly? House?
4916000	4917000	House
4917000	4918000	House
4920000	4922000	I didn't, do they say, do they say who's?
4922000	4928000	No, okay, let me tell you what that's about, uh, see, there's about, uh, on the east coast
4928000	4931000	That's where everyone sounds more, uh, Irish
4931000	4936000	And that's where everyone's all talking about the trawler and the fish and they're going out, uh, say, how you going there, boy?
4936000	4937000	Oh, yeah, that's this, eh?
4937000	4939000	Going to Newfoundland there, eh?
4939000	4940000	Which, which
4940000	4942000	That's, they sound like the stereotypical Canadians, but that's not me
4942000	4955000	Which is obviously just a cousin of my homeland, Wisconsin, we all, everybody talks, talks, talks like, well, the Fargo people, people thought, Fargo, when Fargo came up people, people don't talk like that, that's a little over the top, it's like, no fucking way, dude
4955000	4963000	Because now you're watching Making of a Murderer and managed to walk and, uh, and it's like, oh, yeah, at that particular time, uh
4963000	4964000	You gotta get them out
4964000	4968000	I did not notice that the, uh, the murder weapon was, uh, in place there, and, uh
4968000	4970000	Is that a rav-for-ya?
4970000	4971000	Yeah
4971000	4972000	You gotta
4972000	4973000	Is that a rav-for-99?
4973000	4974000	That's that 99 Toyota, yeah
4974000	4975000	That's a rav-for-99
4975000	4976000	99, yeah
4976000	4978000	You're looking at the plates there, yeah?
4978000	4979000	Uh, no
4979000	4980000	Damn
4980000	4982000	No, I'm not looking at the vehicle
4982000	4983000	That was insane
4983000	4984000	Nuts
4984000	4986000	Dude, fuck you guys, like, like, it was just
4986000	4989000	We're conscious of your spoilers, but, uh, it's like
4989000	4993000	But also it's a real thing in the world, so, like, it's, you can
4993000	4994000	What is?
4994000	4997000	It happened, like, it happened, and it's been in the news and stuff, so, like
4997000	4998000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
4998000	4999000	Can't really spoil a thing
4999000	5002000	I'm interested now, though, the reason I love those documentary series is because you always
5002000	5007000	You get to watch the whole thing, and then you get to do the whole second wave of, like, because everyone starts talking about how
5007000	5011000	It's not, that's not accurate, and then you get to, like, read all the extra shit
5011000	5012000	It's fun
5012000	5013000	It's fun
5013000	5019000	It's fun when people go to prison for their, uh, the, uh, yeah, like, the Memphis, the south of the West Memphis thing
5020000	5022000	Like, this is, like, a genre of entertainment for us
5022000	5027000	It's, like, a miscarriage of justice stories that we never paid attention to in real life
5028000	5029000	Miscarriage of justice
5029000	5030000	It's a novella
5030000	5031000	Second screen experience
5031000	5035000	And then it was, like, I was at the CNN on TV at the, uh, the airport
5035000	5040000	And I was just seeing the Chyrons, uh, that was, like, oh, yeah, Netflix, like, this thing is so popular
5040000	5045000	And, of course, people are petitioning and saying, like, look, uh, like, like, like, change this thing
5045000	5047000	I'm trying to not do any spoilers
5048000	5050000	And it's like, you know, nothing's gonna change
5050000	5055000	Like, like, like, no one cares that you watched the Netflix show
5056000	5060000	Like, like, they were aware of the stakes at the time that this shit was happening
5062000	5065000	Um, it's, it is, like, it's, I mean, and not that I disapprove of that
5065000	5069000	I mean, I think it's great that when you're watching something like that, like, I think that, yeah, whatever
5069000	5072000	One of my fucking talks, you gotta stick your head up your ass, Harvey
5072000	5074000	You're talking about a good show, is...
5074000	5076000	I'm talking about the, uh
5076000	5077000	Sorry for interrupting
5077000	5080000	No, no, no, I wanted to get back to that character
5080000	5087000	At that point in time, we had noticed that the, uh, the blood was coming out of a decapitated head
5088000	5096000	And so we decided at that particular time to go and investigate behind the barn
5098000	5101000	And what did you see behind the barn?
5102000	5103000	Corporal Langerhanger
5104000	5109000	Uh, we saw the rest of the, uh, the body and there was blood all over the place and...
5109000	5113000	Yeah, it's like, it's like a, it's like a relative, none of that is real from the thing
5113000	5114000	There's no decapitated
5115000	5117000	Uh, there's no blood
5117000	5122000	The, the, the, it's like, it's like a Norwegian thing, like, right?
5122000	5124000	Like, how does that, how does that accent work?
5124000	5128000	No, I think it's like a British Isles, actually, thing that kind of, like, diluted
5128000	5132000	And then it got really, it's a poor people accent, actually
5133000	5140000	No, really, like, if you guys want to talk about, like, what divides people, it's not, everyone's like, oh, race this, race that, or like, regions this
5140000	5141000	No, it's just rich and poor people
5141000	5143000	And, like, back in the day it was all Irish people
5143000	5144000	Oh, Canada
5145000	5147000	Oh, Canada
5147000	5149000	For us, it was, uh, the Ukrainians
5149000	5150000	Everyone shat on the Ukrainians
5150000	5152000	And they were like, oh, you smell like cabbage
5152000	5155000	And, but, uh, the Irish for the longest time were, like, the shitty people
5155000	5157000	And they had, like, the poor people accent
5157000	5161000	And that was, like, the, like, the ghettoized language that was floating around
5161000	5163000	So that's where a lot of it comes from
5163000	5167000	Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that accents are, they're, like, genealogical
5167000	5170000	Like, they, like, definitely for sure, Wisconsin, for sure
5171000	5172000	Oh, yeah
5172000	5175000	The most effect on Wisconsin's accent
5175000	5181000	It's, like, it's, it's, uh, it has to do with the earliest settlers to that area
5181000	5185000	Uh, coming through the north and coming down
5185000	5186000	Oh, yeah, on the south there
5186000	5191000	But they were, uh, but they were coming from, like, uh, I believe it's, like, when you hear it
5191000	5194000	And you compare it to, like, Norwegian accents and stuff
5194000	5195000	It's, like, it has something to do with that
5195000	5196000	I don't fucking know
5197000	5198000	Sure
5198000	5200000	I don't know, but I have opinions and I'm, like, like, shouting ears down
5200000	5201000	I don't know
5201000	5202000	Eh, okay
5202000	5204000	Um, because you're, because you're, like, it's just, when you're poor
5204000	5207000	Well, when you're poor, you don't just decide to elongate your O's
5208000	5210000	I can't afford to talk cool
5212000	5214000	That's, from now on, that's a boat
5216000	5218000	Your dad's too poor to go to the country club
5218000	5220000	And then you just all sit around talking to lumber
5220000	5224000	And then, you're like, ah, fucking, let's go fishing then, all right
5224000	5226000	I can't afford the letter U
5228000	5229000	I sold it
5230000	5232000	I sold it for a boot, uh
5233000	5235000	We traded it in for rye down at the store, eh?
5236000	5238000	Uh, what's the candidate questions?
5238000	5240000	Um, what does candidate think about lesbians?
5240000	5242000	Uh, we're, we're very cool with lesbians
5242000	5245000	Uh, we're all over, uh, gay rights and gay marriage
5245000	5247000	Tell her like you mean it
5249000	5250000	I'm just kidding
5250000	5251000	We're into it, okay
5251000	5252000	Thanks
5252000	5253000	We're with you
5253000	5254000	I, I really appreciate your support
5254000	5256000	I do have to say one thing, though
5256000	5257000	Eve was framed
5259000	5260000	Yeah
5261000	5262000	Uh, Lilith
5262000	5263000	That's an Adam joke
5263000	5264000	Lilith was framed, actually
5264000	5265000	Yeah, there you go
5265000	5267000	I know this guy knows what's talking
5267000	5268000	Right, right
5268000	5269000	Sorry for Lilith, by the way
5269000	5270000	Thank you, I appreciate it
5270000	5272000	Wait, who's, who's Lilith again?
5273000	5274000	What?
5274000	5275000	I'm sorry
5275000	5277000	The first, Adam's first wife
5277000	5278000	Wait
5278000	5279000	Oh, yeah
5279000	5280000	That's not in the real Bible
5280000	5281000	That's education time
5281000	5285000	Okay, so like, well, was this in like the, um, uh, the, uh, the Torah?
5285000	5287000	This is a super old story
5287000	5289000	Adam had a first wife before Eve
5289000	5291000	And, uh, she came down and she was all like
5291000	5292000	It's in the face
5292000	5293000	Here's the way it's gonna be
5293000	5296000	And Adam's like, whoa now, that's a little too, uh, aggressive for me
5296000	5297000	That's a little too gay
5297000	5298000	Yeah
5299000	5300000	Get the fuck out
5300000	5301000	Let's make a new one
5301000	5302000	Pull a rib out, make an Eve
5302000	5304000	And she's all like, I do whatever you want
5304000	5306000	Uh, and so that's the story that Christians know
5306000	5308000	But there's like, like, Lilith Fair
5308000	5309000	Of course
5309000	5312000	Is based off the idea that there was an uppity woman who, uh, who didn't do what she was told
5312000	5313000	Mm-hmm
5313000	5315000	Wait, but was there or wasn't there?
5315000	5317000	I mean, I, I, I mean, I'm not asking if the Bible was real
5317000	5320000	I'm saying, is there, is there some version of the Bible?
5320000	5321000	It's apocryphal
5321000	5323000	You know, there's a lot of apocryphal, aren't there?
5323000	5325000	Well, like, uh, is it Gnostic? Is it one of the Gnostic things?
5325000	5327000	Oh, so it's like one of these, it's like Gnosticism
5327000	5328000	It's like one of these
5328000	5330000	There's, there's like texts out there that they
5330000	5331000	They draw
5331000	5332000	Okay
5332000	5333000	I love midrash
5333000	5334000	Yeah
5334000	5337000	So there's actual, there's actual texts that have been, like, filed away
5337000	5338000	Like the
5338000	5339000	Making a midrash
5341000	5342000	I'm only halfway through, though
5344000	5345000	I won't spoil the ending for you
5345000	5346000	Don't spoil it for me
5346000	5348000	What was the other thing? Was it that there was a female disciple?
5348000	5351000	Or was it just that Mary had, like, more of an active role?
5351000	5354000	Mary Magdalene was actually a disciple
5354000	5356000	Yeah, well, like, she got married to Jesus
5356000	5357000	Yes, yeah
5357000	5359000	And then there was a baby and then
5360000	5361000	Tom Hanks, yeah, the whole thing
5361000	5362000	Yeah, Tom Hanks was there
5365000	5366000	I remember that one
5367000	5369000	In Canada we believe all of these things
5371000	5372000	I gotta, I gotta
5372000	5373000	That's the problem, actually, is right now
5373000	5378000	We just actually came through a big, uh, a big push to get back to, to our, like, more lefty side
5378000	5380000	We had an asshole that was kind of Ted Cruz-y
5380000	5382000	Because he's from Canada, by the way, sorry
5382000	5386000	Uh, and, uh, we just had a big election where we elected a reality TV star
5386000	5388000	Who was very funny, and, uh
5389000	5390000	Oh, we should try that
5390000	5391000	Yeah, do it, man
5391000	5396000	Like, uh, uh, what's, who's, like, a really, like, who's a charismatic reality TV star
5396000	5398000	Who's kind of, like, lefty
5398000	5400000	Anthony Bourdain
5400000	5401000	What?
5401000	5402000	What?
5402000	5404000	The guy from Shark Tank, what's that guy?
5404000	5405000	Robert
5406000	5407000	Situation
5407000	5408000	No, no
5408000	5409000	No, the liberal one
5409000	5410000	Like, the Situation
5413000	5415000	Robert Dvorjarak, or whatever his name is
5415000	5417000	The son of an immigrant farmer
5418000	5420000	Okay, like, here's the thing
5420000	5424000	His dad was actually a really super famous, uh, prime minister before this
5424000	5427000	And he called in all sorts of shit and made a bunch of enemies
5427000	5430000	But then after that, his son came out and did a bunch of, you know, blah blah blahs
5430000	5431000	I'm a rich kid, I don't care
5431000	5434000	And he had a really famous video of him being famous for, uh
5434000	5436000	What are you talking about?
5436000	5437000	Uh, our prime minister
5437000	5438000	Oh, okay, sorry
5438000	5439000	Justin Trudeau, yes
5439000	5440000	Justin Trudeau
5440000	5444000	Oh, he created, uh, uh, Dunesbury
5444000	5445000	Yup
5446000	5447000	Um, yeah
5447000	5448000	Alright, well, so, yeah
5448000	5449000	Who cares about that?
5449000	5453000	I think, like, yeah, obviously I was, I was kidding when you, when I
5453000	5455000	I got jingoistic about Canada, because, um
5455000	5457000	You could learn a lot from Canada
5457000	5460000	I'm not feeling particularly patriotic over the last eight years or so
5460000	5462000	But, uh, not because of...
5462000	5465000	It's just eight years, as far back as I can remember
5466000	5469000	I think, but I think it is, like, since his election
5469000	5473000	Which was a kind of exciting thing that made you feel like politics could be part of a story again
5474000	5475000	That whole national psyche thing
5475000	5478000	And then it just, like, turning back into the Jimmy Carter thing
5478000	5480000	Where it's just like, oh, so we're just gonna watch people
5480000	5482000	They just, they love fucking lying
5482000	5484000	And they, like, everything, they think it's all, like, game
5484000	5485000	And their job is to win
5485000	5488000	And it fucking, everybody just, like, like, blames everybody else
5488000	5490000	Well, your guys' media is fucked up
5490000	5493000	Yeah, it's like, it's, it's definitely bad
5493000	5495000	I'm not blaming you
5495000	5497000	Sorry, I'm just saying
5497000	5500000	It's like, well, it's, here's the thing, alright
5500000	5502000	Here's, here's all society's problem
5503000	5506000	We don't have a fucking, when you get those freemium games
5507000	5510000	Don't blame Candy Crush for your politics, man
5510000	5513000	They know, because inevitably in those freemium games
5513000	5515000	There's always, like, two forms of currency
5515000	5517000	You know, the way they get you is they go like
5517000	5519000	You need splooges to, uh...
5521000	5524000	To buy more, uh, seeds
5524000	5528000	And the splooges, you can, like, there's always a secondary currency, though
5528000	5531000	There's always, like, mana points or something like that
5531000	5535000	It's because, if there was just splooges and that's all that mattered
5535000	5538000	There's inevitably gonna be a way to cheat the system
5538000	5543000	Like, the system's not gonna keep working unless there's some kind of, like, secondary value system
5543000	5547000	And obviously what it needs to be is, like, a fucking, like, actual cultural one
5547000	5552000	Like, we actually need to understand, and in some way
5552000	5557000	We need to understand that there's, like, that the money is like poker chips
5557000	5561000	That make the casino run, but that there's something larger
5561000	5565000	Like, the electricity, which is, like, human life
5565000	5567000	Like, it's, like, where it's, like, if you could just make electricity
5567000	5570000	That's more valuable to Las Vegas than any of your money
5570000	5574000	Because they're, like, whoa, we can make the cowboy on the sign, like, have more lassos now
5574000	5578000	Like, so you can stay, and you're valuable at this casino, too
5578000	5582000	It's, like, we don't have, like, it's, like, and you can't use the word religion
5582000	5586000	Because it turns people off, because religion has been co-opted by a bunch of fucking capitalists
5586000	5591000	And, like, but it's, like, that is the problem that America infected the whole planet with
5591000	5596000	Is just, like, this, because we're so good at, like, we were just, like, oh, fuck it
5596000	5600000	No class systems, no kings, no family history, fuck it
5600000	5603000	Like, like, it's just, like, money, money, money, money
5603000	5605000	It'll be the biggest, it'll be the hotel lobby of the world
5605000	5608000	And everybody can come in, and it's just, like, if you're Irish, you're a piece of shit
5608000	5611000	Until you know how to make something, like, soap that we can use
5611000	5613000	Or Lucky Charms, and then we'll use it
5614000	5618000	And then if you're valuable, then you can be rich, and you can be mayor, and you can be president, and fuck it
5618000	5622000	And nothing matters, and it's, like, the American dream that that's our, that, that, that, that
5622000	5625000	Whether that ever actually existed, that was the dream, that was the idea
5625000	5628000	It was egalitarianism through capitalism
5628000	5629000	Meritocracy
5629000	5632000	Yeah, but then someone monetized egalitarianism
5632000	5634000	Then someone's monetized monetization
5634000	5637000	Someone said, I'll watch the money, that'll be my job
5637000	5640000	And I'll pay myself out of the money, and then I'll give you interest
5640000	5644000	And someone said, hey, what if a tornado comes through, oh, I'll sell you insurance
5644000	5645000	What's insurance?
5645000	5648000	Something you're now required to have if you get pulled over
5648000	5650000	A guy with a gun can ask to see your insurance
5650000	5652000	Because if you hit someone, it might cost him money
5652000	5653000	Well, that doesn't seem very fair
5653000	5654000	Well, why don't you sue me?
5654000	5655000	What do you mean, sue?
5655000	5657000	Well, suing is a new form of law
5657000	5659000	It means you can just take all of someone's money
5659000	5660000	Well, who can sue who?
5660000	5662000	Anyone can sue anyone
5662000	5665000	But if you're more rich than someone, you can survive the suing
5665000	5666000	And if you're poor, you can't
5666000	5668000	So if you're poor, you can't sue rich people
5668000	5670000	But if you're rich, you can sue anyone
5670000	5672000	And if you're rich, you can also get sued, and it won't matter
5672000	5675000	And who's going to conduct all this?
5675000	5677000	Lawyers, you have a right to counsel
5677000	5678000	How does that work?
5678000	5680000	Well, if you're poor, you get one assigned to you
5680000	5681000	And you're fucked
5681000	5685000	And if you're rich, you can decapitate a woman with a knife and then walk away
5685000	5689000	It's like, yeah, you know what, I'm taking that stance
5690000	5692000	I think O.J. done it
5693000	5696000	I got a hunch, and I'm just going with it
5697000	5702000	It's every problem we have stems from
5702000	5704000	It's not that capitalism is inherently evil
5704000	5706000	It's that it was never designed
5706000	5708000	It was never meant to be unmitigated
5708000	5710000	I don't think it was ever designed
5710000	5712000	It just kind of fucking sprang up and was a monster
5712000	5714000	That's the good thing about it, though
5714000	5717000	The reason it sprang up and is useful is because
5717000	5720000	It's not a bad thing by nature
5720000	5722000	It's about efficiency
5722000	5724000	It's about getting more shit done per minute
5725000	5730000	It does hold an enormous potential to equivolate
5730000	5732000	What the fuck is the word?
5732000	5733000	What did you say?
5733000	5734000	Equivocate
5734000	5736000	No, that's when you wishy-wash, doesn't it?
5736000	5737000	Equivalency?
5737000	5739000	Equivocate means whatever
5739000	5743000	It does have an enormous potential to even everybody out
5743000	5747000	Especially in a world where we were like, okay, divine rate of kings, we're done with that
5747000	5749000	And now it's just like poker chips
5749000	5752000	It's all the more necessary
5752000	5755000	All the more necessary in a world where that is the only thing that's important
5755000	5757000	That there be another more important thing
5757000	5758000	There has to be
5758000	5760000	Otherwise, it's like, how much does this bullet cost
5760000	5763000	And how much is this black kid going to do
5763000	5767000	If we pursue his presumption of innocence
5767000	5768000	Or we protect him
5768000	5770000	How much money is that going to cost?
5770000	5773000	Everything gets turned into money
5773000	5775000	And then people actually fucking start suffering
5775000	5777000	And we have to like
5777000	5778000	I don't know
5779000	5780000	You can't invent it
5780000	5781000	You can't just come out with something
5781000	5784000	But imagine a world where you were like driving down the street
5784000	5786000	And you saw somebody that needed help
5786000	5789000	And you were on your way to a meeting where you might make a bunch of money
5789000	5790000	I know that there's
5790000	5792000	Working backwards from the goal
5792000	5795000	I know that there's a world where you could stop your car
5795000	5797000	Get out and be like excited
5797000	5799000	Because you haven't seen someone in need in so long
5799000	5801000	That it's like fucking bubble wrap
5801000	5804000	It's like a thing you get to do that's fun
5804000	5809000	And it's something you get to brag about when you get to the meeting that you have to reschedule
5810000	5812000	That meeting just became worth less
5812000	5814000	Because this opportunity is happening for you
5814000	5816000	I'm not talking about all of us suddenly becoming good people
5816000	5820000	I'm talking about the fact that we look at goodness as being this weird thing
5820000	5822000	Like advertising that we have to tolerate or something
5822000	5824000	That we have to force ourselves to do
5824000	5826000	I'm talking about switching that
5826000	5831000	Because we all know that once we're forced to do good shit for other people
5831000	5833000	Much like showering
5833000	5835000	We're always happy we did it afterwards
5835000	5837000	Are you though? Don't lie
5837000	5841000	It's just hard to take off your pants and get into a fucking cold water
5841000	5843000	That's pelting your Asperger skin
5843000	5846000	It's like you don't have Asperger's
5846000	5848000	Shut up I'm rich I can say whatever I want
5848000	5851000	See that's the problem
5851000	5854000	But I know that there's
5854000	5858000	If there was currency to that
5858000	5860000	It always feels like
5860000	5862000	Like you were saying
5862000	5864000	Stupid people incur loss
5864000	5866000	And rich people are smart people
5866000	5868000	Not stupid people gain
5868000	5870000	You don't have to be talking about money
5870000	5873000	You can talk about getting upset and all this shit
5873000	5876000	Like stupidity is like loss
5876000	5880000	If there was a way to gain
5880000	5883000	In a way that you could measure somehow
5883000	5885000	From helping other people
5885000	5887000	It would turn around so quick
5887000	5889000	Because the market would fucking flood
5889000	5891000	And there wouldn't be so many homeless people
5891000	5894000	That you would have to feel like you were doing nothing
5894000	5897000	And wasting your time and becoming homeless yourself
5897000	5898000	By helping them
5898000	5899000	That's the fear
5899000	5901000	We're not like this
5901000	5902000	We don't want to not care
5902000	5904000	We're forcing ourselves
5904000	5905000	We're emotionally anorexic
5905000	5908000	We're controlling our fucking spirituality
5908000	5911000	We're starving ourselves because we're scared
5911000	5915000	That if we spend the time helping somebody
5915000	5917000	That they're going to suck our time and our money away
5917000	5919000	And we're going to become just like them
5919000	5923000	We've got to figure out how to flip that system
5923000	5925000	So that it can be a video game
5925000	5927000	We're never going to not be monkeys
5927000	5928000	We're never going to not want to gain
5928000	5930000	We just have to figure out how to put a value on that
5930000	5932000	China, you know, China's been doing that
5932000	5934000	They started their murder vans
5934000	5937000	Yeah, you hear about these Chinese murder vans
5937000	5939000	No, they started this game
5939000	5941000	I don't remember what it's called
5941000	5942000	But it's like meow meow beans
5942000	5944000	Yeah, the good citizen game or some shit
5944000	5945000	That's like a cult, man
5945000	5946000	That's fucked up
5946000	5948000	I mean, it's more like fascism
5948000	5950000	Like a fascist cult
5951000	5955000	Well, fascism is like a cult when it's fascist, I think
5955000	5960000	Anyway, I'm just like it's this game where you get points for being a good citizen
5960000	5962000	And it's like all fun and games
5962000	5965000	Except in five years it becomes mandatory for all citizens
5965000	5968000	So everyone's going to be required to be all like
5968000	5971000	Oh, I, you know, I prayed to meow
5971000	5972000	That's racist, right?
5972000	5974000	Do they pray to meow?
5974000	5975000	That's a good analogy
5976000	5980000	Or if you're friends with people who say bad stuff about the government
5980000	5982000	You'll be docked points
5982000	5986000	So you got to unfriend your buddies on Facebook when they're taking anti-party lines
5986000	5990000	And that's like an evil version of what you're talking about
5990000	5994000	But there could maybe be a game that's more just about like karma points
5994000	5995000	Or something
5995000	5998000	Yeah, and I don't know if it's like actually just instituting points like that
5998000	6001000	Or if it is just more like, like, I don't know, like just
6001000	6003000	You're talking about points, man
6003000	6004000	Stop talking about points
6004000	6005000	You don't need points
6005000	6006000	Money is points
6006000	6008000	I'm talking about what people should stop talking about
6008000	6010000	No, points are the problem, man
6010000	6012000	Money is literally points
6012000	6015000	You argue, you love telling people that they're wrong
6015000	6016000	Sorry
6016000	6017000	Just have a conversation
6017000	6019000	You don't have to just tell people
6019000	6021000	Have you ever talked about movies with a Canadian?
6021000	6022000	It's fucking galling
6022000	6024000	It's like, will you take it easy?
6024000	6027000	It's like, I can either like or not like Godzilla and so can you
6027000	6029000	It's fucking stop yelling at me
6029000	6032000	Unless you're talking about the Matthew Broderick one in that case
6032000	6033000	That's bad
6033000	6035000	Any movie can just be liked or not liked
6035000	6038000	You guys are, you have great socialized medicine
6038000	6040000	But you're terrible at talking about movies
6040000	6042000	And your Taco Bells have French fries
6042000	6043000	Sorry
6043000	6048000	Whereas Americans are obviously, our greatest gift is for not generalizing
6050000	6052000	No, I think, well, you're talking about points
6052000	6055000	And like a system of rewards or like a
6055000	6057000	That's how the human brain operates
6057000	6058000	That's why money works
6058000	6060000	It's like, like, it's dopamine
6060000	6062000	It's like getting fucking like prize
6062000	6064000	It's getting a jackpot, getting a fucking like
6064000	6065000	It's winning points
6065000	6066000	Lighting something up
6066000	6068000	Like they have, there was this thing on NPR
6068000	6071000	There was like, there was this medicine that helps you get over
6071000	6073000	Was it Parkinson's or
6073000	6074000	Get over Parkinson's
6074000	6076000	There's medicine that helps you get over Parkinson's
6076000	6077000	Holy shit
6077000	6080000	No, it's a treatment for some kind of, some illness
6080000	6082000	I can't remember but it like, it spikes your dopamine
6082000	6085000	So high that they had to, they didn't realize what was happening
6085000	6088000	Until a couple people like actually got really fucked up by this
6089000	6094000	Dopamine causes you, it makes you really, really susceptible to gambling addiction
6094000	6097000	Oh, is this the multiple sclerosis medicine?
6097000	6098000	It could be, I don't know
6098000	6100000	The important thing is the dopamine aspect of it
6100000	6102000	Because they found out by this happening
6102000	6104000	It was like, why are these people on this medicine becoming like
6104000	6105000	Inveterate gamblers
6105000	6106000	Like they're fucking losing their homes
6106000	6107000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
6107000	6108000	And it turns out, and they
6108000	6109000	They did this thing where they're like
6109000	6110000	Oh, it's just fucking like
6110000	6113000	Three cherries come up and a little reward comes out
6113000	6115000	And it's like, what happens in your brain
6115000	6116000	Is this dopamine spike
6117000	6120000	And that's why, that's what has driven our entire species
6120000	6122000	Because we like, we experiment and then we
6122000	6124000	Something happens that benefits us
6124000	6127000	And we get a fucking little baby orgasm about it
6127000	6128000	And it like marks it
6128000	6130000	And then so that's how we get addicted to drugs
6130000	6131000	That's how we get
6131000	6134000	We're always chasing that spike
6134000	6137000	And so that causes racism
6137000	6140000	That causes like our capacity for categorization
6140000	6141000	And solving problems
6141000	6142000	I figured it out
6142000	6144000	All of the people that made me have a bad day
6144000	6145000	Yesterday were Mexican
6146000	6148000	What a reward
6148000	6151000	It's bad
6151000	6152000	It's good and bad
6152000	6154000	But it's like, it's this powerful engine that we run on
6154000	6155000	So I think like
6155000	6158000	You can write software on top of that machine language
6158000	6161000	That maybe it's a point system
6161000	6162000	Maybe that's bad
6162000	6164000	Maybe there's a way to get beyond a point system
6164000	6166000	But I think the biological fact is
6166000	6168000	That our brains do run on that engine
6168000	6172000	Like we do run on like figuring out puzzles
6172000	6173000	And getting rewarded for
6173000	6174000	Oh totally
6174000	6175000	You're totally right
6175000	6178000	We're very much like meaning engines
6178000	6179000	We're problem solvers
6179000	6181000	We attribute things to points
6181000	6183000	But when someone says
6183000	6184000	This is worth a point
6184000	6185000	Someone else is going to go
6185000	6187000	How can I make money off that
6187000	6190000	How can I make two points for every one point I make, right?
6190000	6192000	So if you can get rid of that system
6192000	6193000	And instead say
6193000	6196000	Well what if I gave away all my points
6196000	6199000	And then I stopped feeling like a piece of shit
6199000	6201000	That would be a better system
6201000	6203000	If it was just like getting rid of stuff
6203000	6205000	Made everyone around you feel good
6205000	6207000	And then as a result of that you felt better
6207000	6210000	That's socialism motherfuckers
6210000	6211000	Yeah I mean I said
6211000	6214000	There was a way to create a system by which we could all hit the
6214000	6216000	Typical point of understanding that
6216000	6218000	As in the video games where we have points
6218000	6220000	And then you spend them on like upgrading things
6220000	6221000	Yeah
6221000	6222000	That the upgrades weren't just for you
6222000	6225000	The upgrades were actually your contribution to the society and all that shit
6225000	6226000	Yeah
6226000	6227000	Yeah
6227000	6228000	We'll figure it out
6228000	6229000	We're going to figure it out
6229000	6230000	I hope you do
6230000	6232000	We better quick
6232000	6234000	Canada's doing pretty good so we're waiting for you to catch up
6234000	6235000	Yeah
6235000	6237000	I mean you guys can't be doing that good, right?
6237000	6239000	Not well our dollar sucks
6239000	6241000	It sucks being down here right now
6241000	6244000	Because like everything costs like a buck and a half more
6244000	6245000	It's brutal
6245000	6248000	It must be a nightmare to buy magazines in Canada, right?
6248000	6250000	Yeah everything matters
6250000	6252000	They already cost more and then the dollar is weaker, right?
6252000	6256000	So it's like they got to cost like 25 bucks for a fucking people
6256000	6257000	What?
6257000	6259000	You think people buy people?
6260000	6262000	I mean if they wanted to
6262000	6263000	They're the luckiest people of all
6263000	6265000	Here's my equivalency
6265000	6269000	Magic cards cost five bucks a booster pack
6269000	6270000	That sucks
6270000	6273000	Did you just try to say Buster pack?
6273000	6274000	No
6274000	6275000	It's a nerd thing
6275000	6276000	I don't know
6276000	6278000	Everything costs more
6278000	6282000	Alright well let's thank Prime Minister Adam for coming by
6282000	6283000	Thank you
6287000	6288000	Alright
6289000	6291000	So what do you think?
6291000	6292000	DuBourge isn't back there, right?
6292000	6293000	Is he?
6293000	6294000	No I think he might be at Sketchfest
6294000	6295000	Yeah
6296000	6297000	Thank you
6298000	6300000	I know that means you love me
6300000	6303000	But I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy
6304000	6306000	But we should, what we should do is go out in the street
6306000	6308000	And like grab people that we really really like
6308000	6310000	And just make them be president
6310000	6311000	That would be the way to do it
6311000	6313000	Because it's just a fucking, it should just be a job
6313000	6316000	That's like, like, like, it's a civil servant
6316000	6318000	You know, like the country runs itself
6318000	6321000	It's fucking, like this idea that you get to be king and get blowjobs
6321000	6324000	It's fucking, I was about to say retarded
6324000	6326000	But I don't want to praise it
6332000	6336000	Okay, so maybe we should talk about what we learned
6336000	6340000	In the form of a nice, slow rap
6340000	6345000	Uh oh
6345000	6348000	You took off your headphones, does that mean you're?
6348000	6349000	Give me a minute
6349000	6350000	Okay, he needs a minute
6350000	6352000	Alright, what did you hold up, Levy?
6352000	6353000	A cup
6353000	6354000	Oh, okay
6354000	6356000	Are you drinking?
6356000	6358000	Levy, come out here and give us a Levy update
6358000	6360000	Yeah, you need a hype man for your rap
6360000	6361000	Oh yeah, yeah
6361000	6363000	Hype man
6363000	6364000	Steve Levy
6364000	6366000	You need a boss tongue
6367000	6372000	We're going to be in Miami next week, so no show here, right?
6372000	6374000	Right, next week, okay
6374000	6377000	We're going to be in Miami at something con
6377000	6380000	Magic City Con
6380000	6382000	Magic City Con
6382000	6384000	There's cons and there's gates
6384000	6389000	The objective is to get more cons and less gates
6390000	6393000	Do you ever wonder what would have happened
6393000	6396000	If Watergate had happened at like Marriott
6396000	6399000	Or Four Seasons
6399000	6403000	If a president got caught embezzling
6403000	6406000	It would be called like embezzle Four Seasons
6406000	6409000	Or embezzle Blade Four Seasons
6409000	6414000	That's the kind of stuff me and Stephen Wright think about
6414000	6417000	In 1980
6418000	6422000	Who's your favorite stand-up, Rhea?
6422000	6428000	Who was your hero that made you want to be a stand-up?
6428000	6434000	Well, honestly, this is going to be so cliche, but Ellen DeGeneres
6434000	6437000	I wouldn't have it any other way
6437000	6439000	I mean, it's perfect
6439000	6441000	Did you and Tig go and see her a lot?
6441000	6443000	Yeah, yeah, we like held hands, watched it
6443000	6445000	We're like, this is great, right?
6446000	6448000	Should we take the home-mobile to Ellen's concert?
6448000	6450000	Yeah, let's take the home-mobile
6451000	6454000	I remember when I was a kid
6454000	6457000	I thought Ellen was very plucky and fun and funny
6457000	6462000	That was before she became an icon of controversy slash progress slash whatever
6462000	6466000	Yeah, I mean, she is a solid stand-up comedian
6466000	6468000	Certainly because her contemporaries
6468000	6472000	Not to throw them too much under the bus, but her contemporaries were Rita Rudner
6472000	6474000	Actually, Paula Poundstone was really funny
6474000	6477000	Did you ever watch Paula Poundstone's show on HBO?
6477000	6479000	I feel like I did
6479000	6482000	She just had regular people up and talk to them
6482000	6486000	She would have firemen and dentists and stuff
6491000	6493000	He's still working on it
6493000	6494000	You got beats?
6494000	6495000	Oh, shit
6495000	6498000	Oh, go to omaze.com slash
6498000	6500000	Rick and Morty
6500000	6501000	Is that going to get them there?
6501000	6504000	Yeah, I think there's only like a week left
6504000	6509000	Yeah, you can still buy shit there or just donate $10 and each $10 donation
6509000	6513000	Justin just made, I think, nine original artworks that you can donate
6513000	6514000	So there's more stuff to buy
6514000	6518000	Each $10 gets you a...it's for AIDS, which is bad
6518000	6520000	It's not for AIDS, it's against AIDS
6523000	6530000	Each $10 gets you entered into a thing where you have a chance of being a voice on Rick and Morty
6531000	6533000	And I'll hang out with you, too
6539000	6541000	Well, what a night

6556000	6557000	Slow rap
6557000	6558000	Ask him if they're ready for it
6559000	6561000	Are you ready for Dan Harmon?
6561000	6563000	Does it sound like you're fucking ready?
6563000	6565000	Come on, get way out of work
6567000	6569000	Question their readiness

6583000	6585000	She's no longer tight
6585000	6588000	I took her shoes off and put them on her head
6588000	6591000	I rolled around with her in bed
6591000	6593000	We slept till noon
6593000	6595000	We woke up and watched Netflix
6595000	6596000	We had a great time
6596000	6598000	We ate some Chex Mix
6599000	6601000	I went downstairs
6602000	6604000	I got scared
6605000	6607000	I heard a sound
6607000	6608000	There was a sound
6608000	6610000	Somebody was around
6610000	6612000	I wanted to look like a man
6612000	6613000	So I went down
6613000	6615000	I said, nobody's here
6615000	6617000	But I didn't look around that much
6618000	6620000	I just wanted your mama to think I did
6621000	6623000	Truth is, I was scared
6623000	6625000	Went back up to bed
6625000	6627000	Rolled around, heard another sound
6627000	6630000	Instead, got scared again
6630000	6631000	Should I call 911?
6631000	6633000	No, don't worry about that
6633000	6635000	My manhood's just begun
6635000	6638000	I went back downstairs
6639000	6641000	Looked around again
6643000	6645000	Looked more around
6645000	6647000	Opened doors fast
6647000	6649000	And said, I've got a gun
6649000	6651000	Which wasn't true
6651000	6654000	But what you gonna do
6654000	6656000	When you're white in the suburbs
6656000	6658000	And you don't have a gun
