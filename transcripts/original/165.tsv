0	7000	Fuck yeah! Harman Town is now in session!
7000	17000	I'm your guest Comptroller, Steve Agee. Please give it up for your Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
17000	33000	And the fair of Harman Town, Dan Harmon!
33000	39000	Thank you!
39000	45000	I'm so fat and sad and tired.
45000	51000	I know what looks dumb, the fucking ad ad on the fat fat.
51000	58000	I know I'm just setting myself up, but who cares? I don't care. I don't care about your dumb opinions.
58000	62000	Zero fucks given, as the kids say.
62000	66000	I hate the kids.
66000	75000	Do you remember, I was just sitting today and I was thinking about, it just hit me because we were all paying attention.
75000	80000	It was all too intense at the time. It wasn't a time when you wanted to draw attention to one part of it.
80000	88000	But remember that halfway through, right halfway through, the horrible headcount of his victims,
88000	92000	like hitting its peak, that Bill Cosby's Twitter account tweeted,
92000	96000	Go ahead, meme me! Remember that?
96000	99000	And everyone was just like, okay!
99000	106000	There must have been some 28 year old kid that was like, look, you've got to go counterintuitive right now.
106000	110000	You've got to remind people of the pudding pops.
110000	115000	And what kids like to do these days is they take a picture and you just like,
115000	119000	you know those pictures that you threaten to sue people for putting on the internet?
119000	122000	Because you've always been such a hound dog about your likeness.
122000	126000	Payback's a bitch, the House of Cosby's shutting down, motherfucker.
126000	130000	But I finally got him, I got him!
130000	133000	Full circle.
133000	137000	But anyway, yeah, I mean, what did you, how would you, that was crazy that people were like,
137000	140000	that someone was like, yeah, this is a good, just put your, who cares?
140000	145000	That's like when they sent out, do the hashtag Ask Trump.
145000	153000	Remember that? Yeah, I mean, you can't see in advance what's going to, that's not going to work.
153000	158000	The Buzzfeed articles aren't going to be showcasing the kindest things.
158000	160000	Anyways, whatever, it doesn't matter.
160000	163000	It doesn't matter because tonight's a super moon!
163000	174000	Blood moon! Blood moon!
174000	177000	Yeah, it's funny, watch it jiggle.
177000	180000	The ad-ad's walking.
180000	183000	Is that? The toe cable, get the toe cable?
183000	188000	The ad-ad has a death star in it.
188000	190000	With a bowling ball.
190000	193000	So Spencer was sitting outside my house.
193000	195000	Why? I sure was.
195000	198000	I don't know, I'm talking to the authorities now.
198000	201000	No, Spencer was waiting for me and I was letting my dogs poo-poo.
201000	203000	And we were going to come to the show.
203000	206000	And there's super moon traffic all over Los Angeles tonight.
206000	207000	People are very excited about this.
207000	208000	It's fucked up.
208000	213000	And when I came back to the car, you said that...
213000	214000	No, Dustin.
214000	215000	Well...
215000	216000	I like Dustin.
216000	218000	Well, you want Dustin to come out and...
218000	220000	No, he told this story.
220000	222000	I do not want him out here.
222000	224000	All right, all right.
225000	229000	So, Dustin was also in the car.
229000	231000	And he said the guy...
231000	233000	Because there's people walking all over Los Feliz.
233000	237000	I guess they're going up to the Griffith Observatory to look at the super moon.
237000	243000	And a guy drove by Spencer's car while they were waiting for me.
243000	247000	And he stuck his head out the window as if to ask for directions and said,
247000	249000	Where the moon?
251000	252000	He just pointed up.
252000	253000	Did I get that right?
253000	254000	Where the moon?
254000	255000	Where the moon?
255000	256000	Where the moon?
256000	257000	Where the moon?
257000	258000	Where the moon?
258000	259000	Like a New Yorker kind of thing.
259000	262000	Go down to third.
262000	265000	And you'll see a stop and go.
265000	268000	And there's a gas station, Kitty Corner, from it.
268000	270000	Is that a regional thing, Kitty Corner?
270000	275000	Well, anyways, it's the moon!
275000	277000	But also, you can't see it from here, right?
277000	282000	But you can't drive to it in the best light.
282000	289000	There's people that are walking uphill-hurst right now with a can of Coors in their hand,
289000	293000	casually strolling to look at the moon at the Griffith Observatory.
293000	297000	I don't think they know how far they're walking.
297000	299000	Yeah, it's like four or five miles.
299000	301000	I think it's like people who see this...
301000	304000	I can see the looks are from here in Las Vegas, you know?
304000	307000	Then three hours later, you're puking in a bush.
307000	309000	It's a pyramid!
309000	310000	It's right there!
310000	312000	It's got a big light on it!
312000	313000	Where the moon?
313000	317000	It's like a real pyramid as far away!
317000	320000	All right, I don't know what I'm looking at.
320000	324000	This is a bunch of notes about our delightful guests that we're going to talk about.
324000	327000	And there's only one thing that's not that, and it says,
327000	329000	Where the moon?
329000	330000	That's my note.
330000	335000	I was once in my car, and I was at the Denny's parking lot over at Gower Gulch,
335000	339000	and there were a bunch of guys hanging out in the parking lot,
339000	341000	and I overheard one of them go,
341000	345000	Edward, the North Star ain't a star, it's a fucking planet!
349000	351000	And the other guy goes,
351000	352000	How the fuck do you know it's a planet?
352000	353000	He goes,
353000	355000	Cuz the fucking thing's twinkling, motherfucker!
357000	358000	Oh, there he goes,
358000	359000	Cuz it's not twinkling.
359000	362000	People's stars twinkle, planets don't twinkle!
365000	370000	Remember Richard Pryor would do dialogue between two people from the neighborhood?
370000	372000	That's how he became famous.
372000	375000	And Bob Newhart became famous for talking on the phone.
375000	377000	He'd do phone calls.
377000	379000	Hey, hello.
379000	381000	So anyways, I thought,
381000	388000	Who invented luggage?
388000	391000	What was that phone call about?
391000	393000	Hello?
394000	397000	The box company.
397000	401000	Yes, some of our boxes do have handles on them.
401000	407000	Well, that's a box with a handle.
407000	409000	No, I'm sorry.
409000	411000	Three hours later, standing ovation.
411000	415000	I don't know how he does it.
415000	418000	If you're detecting a little bit of like,
418000	422000	I guess I kind of went after Bob Newhart there a little bit.
422000	425000	And I didn't realize that I had it in for him,
425000	427000	but I just remembered that
427000	431000	I did something at the Creative Arts Emmys on stage with Joel McHale,
431000	433000	and when I watched the telecast,
433000	435000	because I felt like I killed,
435000	438000	but it did cut to a shot of Bob Newhart going...
442000	445000	Like, he looked like a mosquito flew up his nose.
445000	446000	Yeah.
446000	447000	And I was like,
447000	448000	Come on, man.
448000	450000	Your phone space work was really good, though.
451000	452000	Thank you.
452000	453000	Comptroller Steve Agee, everybody.
453000	455000	Oh, yeah, thank you.
458000	462000	Thanks for having me on this Supermoon Sunday.
462000	464000	Where's Jeff?
464000	469000	He had a bad burrito.
469000	471000	He's pooping.
471000	472000	He's pooping, yo.
472000	476000	Look at this Pikachu skateboarder.
476000	478000	Is that a weapon?
478000	480000	You're terrifying.
480000	481000	Jesus Christ.
481000	482000	It's plastic.
482000	483000	It's plastic.
483000	484000	It shoots lasers, though.
484000	485000	All right.
485000	486000	One is healthful.
486000	488000	It's a master sword.
488000	489000	What's your name?
489000	490000	Can I ask?
490000	491000	Yeah, it's Mike.
491000	492000	Mike?
492000	493000	Yes.
494000	495000	You're from Canada?
495000	496000	Yeah.
496000	497000	Oh, man.
497000	498000	Don't come near me.
498000	499000	Yeah.
499000	500000	I hurt people.
500000	501000	Jesus.
501000	502000	What in the world?
504000	505000	I guess they have...
505000	509000	The weapons in Canada are plastic, so jokes like that are funnier there.
510000	512000	Don't come near me.
512000	513000	I hurt people.
514000	517000	Have you read a paper from here?
517000	519000	Like in the last three hours?
519000	521000	We hurt people.
521000	523000	And we're bummed out about it.
523000	525000	We're trying not to.
527000	531000	Yeah, there's a drunk guy just out back in the nerd melt when I was walking in,
531000	534000	and I was glad he did not stab me.
535000	538000	And just before anyone says anything, he was white.
538000	540000	He was a white drunk man.
540000	543000	This is not racial motivated fear.
543000	544000	That's nice.
544000	545000	Turned out just drunk.
545000	547000	I pictured him as white immediately.
547000	548000	Thank you.
548000	550000	I guess his name was Frank.
550000	553000	How the fuck do you know his name is Frank?
553000	554000	Because that's...
554000	558000	He firmly grasped my hand while looking to me.
558000	559000	You touched him?
559000	560000	He touched me.
560000	561000	That sounded horrible.
561000	563000	Let me make one thing clear.
564000	565000	He touched me.
565000	567000	He said, can I be Frank?
568000	571000	Yeah, Spencer, his name's not Frank.
571000	575000	He just wanted to break down some hardcore statistics with you about homelessness.
575000	578000	I was like, you could be whatever you want to be, man.
578000	579000	No, what did he say?
579000	580000	He grabbed you and he said...
580000	584000	He grabbed my hand and was shaking and he was like, I'm Frank.
584000	586000	And I was like, oh, great.
586000	587000	I'm Spencer.
587000	589000	And he's like, great, great, great.
589000	591000	And I'm like, yeah, it's great.
591000	592000	And he's like, I like it.
592000	594000	And I'm like, yeah, I think.
594000	595000	And he's like, you're thinking?
595000	596000	You're thinking?
596000	599000	And I'm like, yeah, most of the time, yeah, I'm thinking.
599000	603000	And he's like, that's good.
603000	604000	That's good.
604000	608000	And then he was just the rest of the time, he was just commenting on how great it was
608000	609000	that I was thinking.
609000	612000	And I thought he was going to turn into an angry mode at some point, like, you know,
612000	614000	like, this guy's thinking too much.
614000	619000	But he cooled off and then he shook someone else's hand and then he wandered off.
620000	622000	First of all, that sounds like...
622000	627000	He sounds like that smart bot online, you know, like the one where...
627000	628000	Smarter child?
628000	631000	The one where it's just based on previous people's entries.
631000	635000	So even though it's really cool what it says to you, the conversation doesn't...
635000	637000	It only lasts a couple of minutes.
637000	639000	So you go like, hey, how are you?
639000	642000	And it says something amazing, like, hey, what do you think of John Travolta?
642000	644000	And you're like, whoa, you like John Travolta?
644000	646000	And he's like, what do you like?
646000	648000	Yeah, that's what it's like.
648000	649000	I like popcorn.
649000	651000	Pop my corn.
651000	652000	And you're like, okay.
652000	654000	That's how it is to talk to my roommate.
654000	656000	When I'm talking to him, it feels like that.
656000	658000	Because I'm just like, hey, how's it going?
658000	660000	And he's like, how you doing?
660000	661000	And I'm like, I'm doing good.
661000	663000	And he's like, doing good is good.
663000	664000	And I'm like, what?
664000	666000	And he's like, doing my what?
666000	669000	And I'm like, this is not a conversation.
669000	672000	And he's like, conversations are doing my what?
672000	674000	And then he just wanders out.
674000	676000	I'm like, this guy's a robot.
676000	679000	Remember when we were at that bar in Culver City
679000	682000	and those guys came in?
682000	683000	Oh, my God.
683000	684000	And they were trying to like.
684000	687000	Now, that was racial motivated fear.
687000	689000	Well, it was because it was like an all.
689000	692000	It was like, yeah, because they were.
692000	694000	It was, what is the.
694000	698000	It was this old, old white guys bar.
698000	700000	There's just old, old dudes hanging out.
700000	701000	And then we wandered in.
701000	703000	And then these Mexican guys showed up.
703000	705000	And they were really fucking high.
706000	709000	Which isn't a problem, but they seem to carry on
709000	712000	as if people knew they were high, they'd get arrested.
712000	713000	Right.
713000	716000	So it created a lot of tension right off the bat.
716000	719000	And it was not dialed down from that point on.
719000	722000	And it felt like the bigger guy was like the littler guy's
722000	723000	uncle or something.
723000	725000	It didn't feel like they were hanging out as friends.
725000	729000	It was almost like this is the equivalent of in the Midwest
729000	731000	of being dragged into the woods to go deer hunting.
731000	733000	It's just like, come on, I'm going to take you
733000	734000	into this white people's bar.
734000	736000	And we're going to we're going to get yelled at.
738000	742000	And then you'll be a man because he really wanted like he
742000	744000	wanted to get yelled at.
744000	746000	But everybody was like, like, OK.
746000	747000	It's like lately.
747000	748000	Yeah.
748000	750000	So the younger guy, he was really like drunk and high,
750000	752000	but he was having a great time.
752000	754000	And he just wanted to talk about football.
754000	756000	And he was in a great mood and everyone was loving it.
756000	759000	But we were loving it too much for the older guy
759000	761000	because he thought that we were making fun of the little guy.
761000	763000	But we were just he was great.
763000	764000	You know, he was having fun.
764000	765000	We were just guessing him.
765000	767000	He wanted to talk about like moon boots or whatever came up.
767000	768000	Yeah.
768000	769000	And we're like, oh, what about moon boots?
769000	770000	Remember moon boots?
770000	771000	He's like, come on, come on, man.
771000	772000	He's drunk.
772000	774000	But then the weird thing is then he turned to the kid and go,
774000	775000	shut the fuck up.
775000	776000	What did I fucking tell you?
776000	777000	Fuck up.
777000	778000	Fucking embarrassing.
778000	779000	You shut up.
779000	780000	I'm talking.
780000	781000	You shut the fuck up.
781000	782000	It was crazy.
782000	783000	Are you serious?
783000	784000	Yeah.
784000	786000	That was a burst that you know, that was a half burst.
786000	788000	And it happened like 20 times.
788000	789000	But all the time.
789000	793000	The craziest part of it was that the only he kept no matter what topic came
793000	797000	up like like like like he didn't get the like conflict he wanted.
797000	801000	So like I put my glass down on top of my laptop on the bar and he'd go
801000	803000	you just got to put that there.
803000	807000	And I'm like, yeah, he's like you you you want you want liquid on your
807000	808000	laptop.
808000	811000	And I'm like, yeah, I do.
811000	812000	It's it's aluminum.
812000	813000	It's fine.
813000	814000	And he's like, OK, man.
814000	815000	All right.
815000	817000	And it's like, OK, cares about my laptop.
817000	818000	That's a good start.
818000	820000	He's like, hey, man, you don't like night bowling.
820000	821000	Yes.
821000	823000	I was like, you know, we're talking about bowling.
823000	826000	We're like we're like he's trying to pick fights about bowling.
826000	828000	And then but then we're not going to fight him.
828000	830000	So we're just like we're just like we're just we're just agreeing with
830000	831000	him on bowling.
831000	833000	And we're like, yeah, there used to be a lot of good bowling alleys around
833000	837000	here. And he's like, yeah, then what happened?
837000	841000	And McKenna goes, McKenna goes like, well, you know, like they were real
841000	843000	bowling alleys and now it's all that night bowling shit.
843000	847000	And he's like night bowling shit.
847000	851000	And McKenna's like, yeah, you know, like the glow and ball.
851000	852000	Everything's glow in the dark.
852000	855000	And there's like ecstasy music playing and they're doing that.
855000	857000	Like three in the three in the three in the afternoon.
857000	861000	He's like, oh, it's like and it's like, you know, move on and go like,
861000	862000	what is this?
862000	863000	What do you think of this napkin or something?
863000	865000	But the guy kept focusing on McKenna.
865000	868000	He's like, so you don't like night bowling, huh?
868000	869000	Yeah.
869000	871000	So what what in the way?
871000	874000	What you, you, you are in the way.
874000	879000	If the idea is that this is threatening, your gang is the worst.
879000	882000	And then the other guy would be all like, yeah, man, night bowling.
882000	883000	It's like the balls are green.
883000	884000	He's like, shut the fuck up.
884000	885000	Shut up.
885000	886000	Shut the fuck up.
886000	887000	Don't tell you.
887000	890000	Shut the fuck up conversation.
890000	891000	I'm not.
891000	892000	That's not an exaggeration.
892000	898000	It was like the craziest like ventriloquist act turned like like some
898000	900000	fucking weirdest shit.
901000	902000	All right.
902000	903000	All right.
903000	904000	Yeah.
904000	905000	I mean, there's nothing more to say about it.
905000	906000	That was the whole incident, basically.
906000	907000	Yeah.
907000	908000	Yeah.
908000	910000	And it's and it's and it's, you know, it's it's really hard to tell that
910000	913000	story as funny as it is because we live in sensitive times and you don't
913000	917000	want to be, you know, an old, old white fat Dan Harmon doing a fucking awesome
917000	921000	Mexican accent doing his impression of this guy is like, like, you know,
921000	927000	as Donald Trump says, I'm lots of lots of them are wonderful people.
927000	929000	And so many of them are probably listeners.
929000	932000	And I don't want them to hear me doing like some kind of fucking Jose Jimenez
932000	933000	or whatever.
933000	934000	That's crazy.
934000	939000	It was but the guy was like, he was an archetype and he had that accent
939000	943000	and he was like, cut that silhouette and was like, was like trying to like
943000	950000	chest up about night bowling with with Chris McKenna at three in the
950000	953000	afternoon in Culver City next to a shuffleboard.
953000	956000	McKenna's a big dude.
956000	957000	What?
957000	960000	Oh, they eventually they got the they just like I can't remember what the
960000	963000	final topic was, but it was like it was probably like McKenna didn't like
963000	964000	Smurfs or something.
964000	965000	It was.
965000	966000	Yeah.
966000	967000	It was like, it was like, well, what's that supposed to mean?
967000	969000	And it was like, OK, come on.
969000	970000	Like that's enough.
970000	971000	And then the bartender said, OK, guys, get out of here.
971000	973000	And then they just they just did.
973000	974000	They just left.
974000	975000	Yeah.
975000	976000	They were nice about it.
976000	979000	You don't like day drinking.
979000	980000	Yeah.
980000	981000	Yeah.
981000	984000	I wish I wish you could like like bring those guys in through a pneumatic
984000	989000	tube and just like ask them questions like the like the aliens in
989000	993000	I.D. for something like like just have a dialogue without there being any kind
993000	995000	of resentment or anything.
995000	999000	But just just get what what do you want from us?
999000	1001000	You could fight.
1001000	1003000	Why why about night balling?
1003000	1005000	There's so many things to fight about.
1005000	1007000	I'll fight about anything.
1007000	1009000	I was drunk.
1009000	1010000	I don't know.
1010000	1014000	You can feel it was weird because you could feel like the socioeconomic like power
1014000	1019000	structures at play and everyone was trying to like avoid around them and not get into
1019000	1022000	like you know, everyone was trying to tiptoe around everybody else.
1022000	1025000	But that got everyone so stressed out that it came to a head.
1025000	1027000	But you could like see it happening.
1027000	1031000	It was just a bunch of car wrecks as people were trying to accommodate the other and then
1031000	1032000	just not doing a great job of it.
1032000	1033000	Yeah.
1033000	1042000	It's like the the 50s or 60s like scenario is totally unassuming minority person
1042000	1050000	walks into a unfree white establishment and and much to their shock the white people are
1050000	1054000	are are following some code that they now are finding out existed and it's very
1054000	1056000	traumatic for them and it's no better now.
1056000	1061000	Now it's just as bad except it's just like it's all kind of like it's like one person
1061000	1065000	walking in and going well, this is going to be bad and then everyone at the bar going
1065000	1066000	like shit.
1066000	1070000	We're all white aren't we don't think about it.
1070000	1075000	Don't think about it and like everything getting so complicated that you're in an argument
1075000	1080000	about about playing balling and meanwhile everything's fine.
1080000	1084000	But everyone's just worried anyways.
1084000	1087000	Let's let's let's let's make a new friend.
1087000	1090000	Shall we I'd love to Dan but really an old soulmate.
1090000	1096000	If you think about it because I was reading her book today and yeah her her story is very
1096000	1097000	very interesting.
1097000	1102000	So her latest book is sort of a memoir and takes you through the whole her whole origin
1102000	1110000	and and everything and like I also got it got it gets very like surprisingly kind of
1110000	1117000	like revelatory self exploratory and like confessional but it's also very very very
1117000	1120000	lighthearted and adorable but it's a it's a good book.
1120000	1121000	You should check it out.
1121000	1125000	We'll let her talk about it and plug it and you can buy it because I'll probably get the
1125000	1129000	title wrong even though I just read it because I really listened to it.
1129000	1131000	So it's just an arrow to me.
1131000	1135000	Just go out to the store and buy the black arrow.
1135000	1140000	It's four hours and 12 minutes at the speed 1.25.
1140000	1146000	Please welcome someone who has never ever called herself the queen of the nerds but is called
1146000	1155000	that by other people Felicia Day.
1155000	1160000	I think they like it when you sit near Jabba.
1160000	1164000	Hello.
1164000	1165000	All right.
1165000	1169000	So I tell this to everybody but it's it's it's what you'll notice is it's five degrees hotter up
1169000	1171000	here so you can see me sweating.
1171000	1172000	It's your beard.
1172000	1173000	It's not because I'm fat.
1173000	1176000	It's it's cooler out there.
1176000	1177000	I would.
1177000	1178000	Yeah.
1178000	1179000	If you shaved your beard it'd probably be a lot cooler.
1179000	1181000	Now let me speak to that real quick.
1181000	1182000	Oh shit.
1182000	1187000	A beard is actually much like a heat sink where they face heat and sweat.
1187000	1193000	It travels down the beard and dissipates dissipate.
1193000	1198000	Well I mean most people would call it dripping but it.
1198000	1201000	I'm going to start coughing like a cat and a hairball which is the last thing you want
1201000	1202000	to wake up to ever.
1202000	1205000	Oh man.
1205000	1206000	That thing.
1206000	1207000	That's my alarm.
1207000	1208000	Hi.
1208000	1209000	You leap right Felicia Day.
1209000	1210000	Thank you for coming.
1210000	1213000	It's but it's but it seems like overdue that you're here.
1213000	1214000	To me it does anyway.
1214000	1215000	I don't know.
1215000	1216000	I don't know what you think.
1216000	1217000	I mean you invited me.
1217000	1218000	I would have been here.
1218000	1221000	I would have been here yesterday without an invite which would have been creepy.
1221000	1222000	Oh okay.
1222000	1226000	Because I feel like I'm I'm I've always I've always you've always been out there on my radar
1226000	1230000	but I've always been I mean one thing that we will be talking about is how I think we're
1230000	1231000	both workaholics.
1231000	1236000	I think you expounded on I mean you're definitely diagnosable and like had had to overcome it
1236000	1239000	like I'm Dan.
1239000	1243000	But I mean you're also now you've gotten past it and I was like hearing your book and going
1243000	1247000	like shit I'm fucked up and I got I'm not I'm not through this seem way more together
1247000	1248000	in that book.
1248000	1251000	Like I just the other day I was like well you're not working on anything.
1251000	1254000	Go ahead and die.
1254000	1258000	So I mean it's still there but at least I'm I can acknowledge the fact that oh you're
1259000	1264000	like you should definitely go play Witcher because you're working on yourself.
1264000	1265000	Right.
1265000	1271000	My therapist says that when I'm playing Witcher I'm actually just satisfying an addiction
1271000	1275000	to the nervous system being like kind of stressed out.
1275000	1276000	Is that true?
1276000	1279000	I mean she's not like anti-video game.
1279000	1280000	Sounds like it.
1280000	1284000	Well I mean it took her a long time to get there like she never said stop playing video
1284000	1288000	games but she's like come on like how like how come you're not relaxed after you play
1288000	1292000	these things which is like makes me think of my mom like when you were 10 years old
1292000	1296000	and you'd go like God damn it and your mom would call out from the other room like why
1296000	1301000	do you play a game that makes you so upset.
1301000	1309000	Oh because oh because you loved kick stickball so much you bitch.
1309000	1312000	What kickball or stickball shut up.
1312000	1314000	You never speak perfectly either.
1314000	1317000	I'm going to I'm going to get paid to do it one day.
1317000	1318000	What speak.
1318000	1320000	Yeah.
1320000	1321000	OK.
1321000	1326000	You can't even walk on a balance beam or use right handed scissors.
1326000	1327000	So you use left handed scissors.
1327000	1328000	I had to tell.
1328000	1329000	Well I can't use any scissors.
1329000	1330000	I couldn't.
1330000	1336000	My my my my my my my mom had to talk the principal into not holding me back in kindergarten.
1336000	1337000	That happened to me.
1337000	1342000	The one year I actually went to school they wanted to put me in the slow class because
1342000	1349000	I held I scissored toward myself.
1349000	1354000	I mean the thing like it was going from kindergarten to first grade because you're not supposed
1354000	1360000	to be able to read at a college level.
1360000	1363000	The tests have nothing to do with reading comprehension.
1363000	1365000	They put you on a balance beam.
1365000	1366000	What.
1366000	1369000	Like how you test a cat.
1369000	1371000	What does that have to do.
1371000	1374000	Oh this person is going to need to balance.
1374000	1375000	Another thing that happened to me.
1375000	1379000	I had only vivid memories from the one year I went to school and then I was sequestered
1379000	1381000	for the rest of my life which we'll talk about.
1381000	1386000	But I there was a girl named Jennifer and she was balancing on the balance beam because
1386000	1388000	we had a thing we had to do.
1388000	1392000	Bitch poke me in the eye with her with her with her nail and I had to be a pirate for
1392000	1394000	two years in a row.
1394000	1395000	Halloween.
1395000	1400000	Was this was this during the this was it was this a high stakes balancing thing.
1400000	1401000	I don't know.
1401000	1405000	It was it was something you know we all knew we had to like show the teacher that we were
1405000	1406000	going to go across the tires.
1406000	1409000	So we were like let's let's study because I was a colleague back then.
1409000	1411000	And you could have been rooster cockburned.
1411000	1414000	You didn't have to be a pirate.
1414000	1415000	Or snake Pliskin.
1415000	1416000	True grit.
1416000	1417000	Yeah.
1417000	1418000	Yeah.
1418000	1422000	Well I was just telling the story last week about my when I went to daycare at a girl
1422000	1423000	stick a crayon in my mouth.
1423000	1426000	And I was just a distinct memory of the violation.
1426000	1428000	The poking the probing.
1428000	1429000	What color was it.
1429000	1431000	It was red.
1431000	1432000	She was trying to play lipstick.
1432000	1433000	I think she had a crush on me.
1433000	1435000	I gave her that credit.
1435000	1436000	Okay.
1436000	1437000	Listen to the episode.
1437000	1438000	It's great.
1438000	1444000	But so since we're there I mean you keep saying the one year I went to school because like
1444000	1448000	I don't I don't know if I've ever met a homeschooled person like and I certainly wouldn't picture
1448000	1453000	them as as like you know even though I think one of the stereotypes is like that they're
1453000	1462000	not they're more they're they're they're they're capable but you know but you know yeah I wouldn't
1462000	1467000	I wouldn't guess like a homeschooled but but I mean you don't like homeschooled you don't
1467000	1482000	like homeschooled shut the fuck up shut the fuck up shut up but your your mom your mom
1482000	1488000	pulled you and your brother out of school when you were kids because because you you
1488000	1495120	were hoisted by your own petard as we say on this show petards are special pants made
1495120	1502000	of pride I'll explain later but you you there's some sort of like like because it was like
1502000	1506680	a parocha was like a we went we moved to Mississippi so we were from Alabama which was already
1506680	1511600	a problem and then we were moving to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi which was a big problem
1511600	1517880	because that was hickville to the people in Alabama so that was sub hickville and then
1517880	1522160	my mom was concerned because all my family is very highly educated and it was like the
1522240	1527760	worst school system in the world so she was like let's call one place they make you wear
1527760	1535480	uniforms nope you're not going to school that was it's that's it literally what she did but
1535480	1540400	in your in your mom did a you know the kind of job I think we all picture ourselves doing if we
1540400	1544880	tried to teach our kids in homes as homeschooling it was the the beginning of the day slipped to
1544880	1550180	around noon ish and yeah she ordered all these like it's called Calvert school and it's what
1550180	1555460	missionaries use to teach their children and they literally come and just white books kind of like
1555460	1562580	the the generic cereal at the grocery why are you creepily taking pictures of me don't worry you
1562580	1578060	don't like photos you like photography weird angle anyway good trust me okay I'll post it on
1578060	1582980	instagram you'll see it's a cool photo he is a good photographer filter it up um yeah so anyway
1582980	1588980	she she she ordered all these books more like yeah learning and then if she never woke up like
1588980	1594260	before noon so I would be like well I'm gonna educate myself so I would have a strict regiment
1594260	1599500	of like lost in spaces at 10 a.m. you better do three math problems before then and I felt like
1599500	1604900	yeah I'm really educating myself like that that was the totality of my childhood basically
1604900	1611780	programming myself around old noir films musicals old science fiction things and then eating
1611780	1617260	buffalo wings at the TGI Fridays and at one point you're like a violin prodigy and that's like
1617260	1622300	actually you're you're you're one of these kids that's in college at the age of 16 or whatever
1622300	1627900	which is like like worms are in revenge of the nerds the but what how old were you when this
1628100	1634660	this weird chapter happened where your mom was grooming you to be the new Selena like
1634660	1643780	okay it's true okay it was such a strange like flash I mean we were living in San Antonio and
1643780	1648220	that's the heart of Tejano so I don't know why you would think it would be inappropriate I mean
1648220	1656540	I don't speak Spanish or sing or speak Spanish or any of the things that you need to do to be a Tejano
1656660	1661740	star but that does not my mom's the kind of person who will well first of all she I just found out the
1661740	1665500	other day that she crashed a car into somebody in Austin and immediately got out of the car and was
1665500	1673820	like I'm Felicia Day's mother and it actually worked it worked situationally in Austin but
1673820	1685100	because she hit Wil Wheaton yeah who is just driving around your mom's neighborhood with
1685100	1692420	this camera but no she's the kind of person who we would go when she would eventually wake up we
1692420	1697660	would go and to the to the mall for hours while she browsed and we would sit inside the the merry
1697660	1701620	ground of shame you know you just get in there as kids and you're like just twirled a clothes
1701620	1705780	around me and I'll be in a different place please God but she would tell the Clinique saleswoman
1705780	1710380	about my pirouettes and I would be forced to do pirouettes to everybody in the makeup department
1710380	1715780	at like 9 p.m. so this is I mean she's very enthusiastic with my abilities so whenever she
1715780	1720780	met somebody who could possibly make me more of a star she would glom onto them and one of them
1720780	1726660	happened to be a Tejano producer who had a garage that he recorded music in and therefore that was
1726660	1733660	like a door opening to my star happening as a Tejano singer which is a kind of an accordion
1733660	1739820	Hispanic Tex-Mex music if you're not familiar with Tejano it's very jolly and not to get not
1739820	1746460	to get grim but you in the book it you the the closer on that chapter is that then was it Selena
1746460	1753500	that she got Selena she got she's not happy yeah but but but I mean I don't know where you like
1753500	1757860	was that really the reason why it kind of came to a close oh yes she thought it was dangerous at
1757860	1762900	that point because Selena's manager murdered her no this is a terrible story it's like if you
1763060	1769220	life is strange I actually did play like a couple levels of it yeah so I don't want to spoil
1769220	1777660	anything but some deep stuff happens involving like assault and what did you that's crazy shit
1777660	1787140	anyway so I'm trying I'm streaming it and I'm like oh my god it's it's she's she was day right so I'm
1787140	1790500	like laughing uncomfortably which I'm doing right now too because I'm sweating that I'm talking
1790500	1797140	about that in any jovial way and can we change the subject yeah okay yeah yeah but oh is that I
1797140	1800660	wonder if that's the thing that people yeah I didn't know that the game went there I stopped
1800660	1806260	playing it because I was like this is girl shit but I I I enjoyed it for a little while and I
1806260	1809900	don't like feelings I knew it was I knew it was making a joke I knew it was girl shit when I
1809900	1813140	bought it I mean there's a girl that says life is strange it doesn't have an explosion on it and I
1813140	1818060	was like this is this is girl shit in a good way I'm 42 I'm I'm the equivalent of a girl when I'm
1818060	1824500	playing video games I want I don't I'm not I'm not I'm not 15 I don't want to like get in a
1824500	1831620	headset and yell anti-Semitic things at people that may or may not be Jewish I just I want to
1831620	1835380	like do and I thought it was really really interesting that gimmick that they because that's
1835380	1838460	how we've always played games is that you save your place and then you go back and the way that
1838460	1843500	they made it part of the narrative yeah you can rewind time yeah well did you ever played well I
1843500	1846700	could talk about video games all day but braid is also do you ever played that because you could
1846700	1852280	rewind time no what did you what yeah braid it's it's a it was kind of one of the first big
1852280	1857660	indie games braid yeah and I think he has a new game coming out just very soon but after like
1857660	1863220	seven years but braid it was it's kind of like a mark not really Mario but you it's Mario ish
1863220	1866780	in that you it those are the kind of levels but you have to be able to rewind time to actually
1866780	1872500	get through the levels so it's very it's a thinky game yeah it's a hipster game which well did you
1872500	1877180	well okay so a little bit more about hipster video games did you would did you play the you
1877180	1884980	know Juno and Green Lantern the hard to the hard rain sequel the the heavy rain what the fuck
1884980	1893740	beyond two souls yeah yeah no that was not good you didn't like that oh no I'm not I don't think
1893740	1897420	that makes you a bad person I'm like I'm like oh oh I really I really enjoyed that and I hated the
1897420	1902180	pre I hated the rain game I didn't like yeah well it was so dumb and it was the exact same mechanics
1902180	1906020	but I was like oh they did they figured it out this time because I was like enjoying being Juno
1906020	1911900	and like having a psychic friend and coming of age and like like like the lowest that was not a
1911900	1917100	girl game no I was obviously being glib when I said the girl game I'm like I know who I'm talking
1917100	1921140	to and the fact that you're not that they're the whole half of the point of this interview and your
1921140	1927180	career has been like this that there is no ladies play game the irony the irony being and what we
1927180	1932500	were gonna get to this eventually but the that that you're describing your early life which is
1932500	1938500	like very very parallel to mine your experience with this new technology when we're at that age
1938500	1944260	like you and I were both the both the first people that we ever held hands with or kissed were people
1944260	1952740	that we met on computers and and and it back then ironically there was like way more except there
1952740	1959060	was like less like bubbling fury like it was but there was a more welcoming more equal world
1959060	1965300	gender-wise back then I think because it was nerds against the world and now that it's so
1965300	1970820	ironic that like all this time later that it's like it's like it's there's so much more there's
1970820	1975860	all this division we didn't even I mean it officially became a division like a cultural
1975860	1981860	division which is so odd but I guess it's not odd when you've realized that the technology
1981860	1988820	turned mainstream and so back then it was like you had to be you know efforts yeah that modem to dial
1988820	1994820	up the car yeah and if you and if you were the kind of person that was capable of having a that
1994820	2000900	much hatred of anybody you were probably better at football then like like like you know probably
2000900	2005140	you ran landed on that side of the bubble and we're like I'll just play football this shit's hard like
2005140	2010020	like gonna dial up a phone and it's like my mom needs to use it and well I tried to get one of
2010020	2014260	those hacker you know uh I don't know it's a there's a hacker magazine 2600 or something like
2014260	2019060	that I remember trying to get one of those and I'm like I'm gonna be a hacker I was like they're
2019060	2024580	the coolest and I involved like opening like shimming up a telephone line and opening it and
2024580	2031300	knowing wires and I was like I guess I'll just play the game wait you went up an actual in real
2031300	2036340	life no in the well no I they were like basically in that in that get in that magazine which I think
2036340	2040820	is still going on that yeah they would really show you how to hack phone lines oh yeah yeah
2040820	2046020	in order to freaking freak yes long-distance freaking freaking I did that successfully a
2046020	2051380	bunch did you really what yeah I wasn't I didn't earn it but I just like I got codes and numbers
2051380	2057060	and things and I tried you I used it to like call places and not get charged and I called like
2057060	2062660	naughty naughty things uh that that charged you but didn't get charged because I used like those
2062660	2069860	sex lines I just I see how old how old were you Dan how old were you when you were doing this 39
2075300	2079700	I don't know it's like probably like 15 or something 14 you didn't pay these women
2081140	2086180	they weren't even women they were recordings I will yeah I was not like I'm gonna talk to a lady
2086180	2090740	like I don't know how it works well I don't even I don't know either because I tried it once I
2090740	2095140	was just like oh man all these like 900 numbers that are about sex and stuff and I was like but
2095140	2100020	and I was like oh so can you use these numbers like this system to like call one of those things
2100020	2104260	and not get charged and I tried it and it was just like you very quickly found out that it was just
2104260	2107620	you know it's just garbage like they're just trying to trick people into paying for what is
2107620	2112820	like a big long message you know can't hang up well if you want some hot juicy action why don't
2112820	2118500	you press three and I'm like okay I'll take it hot and juicy and then like and it was just like
2118500	2121940	like like recordings after a while I was just like a woman like there's like a recording of
2121940	2127060	a woman going like late at night I like to wear my bathrobe and I hope my man comes home and gives
2127060	2132500	it to me oh oh like it was just and it was just like a shitty recording like it was all like it's
2132500	2136180	still pretty hot you figured it out because I abandoned it the minute I bought one well and
2136180	2139700	then I never did it again I was like okay there's that and who am I going to call in Hong Kong like
2140980	2146100	but I wanted to be like Matthew Broderick obviously or like a William Gibson that you
2146100	2150180	try to read that you think you say oh yeah I read that which you didn't know I didn't read yeah so
2150180	2154820	it was all Matthew Broderick and Albert from Little House on the Prairie and that WizKids show
2154820	2159940	remember WizKids oh my god it lasted like 13 episodes and it was like you know at the height
2159940	2166020	of that stuff was like Max Gale from who was Wojahowicz from uh Barney Miller played a cop
2166020	2170820	who who would go to this Wizkid it was just a total like it was just taking war games and
2170820	2177860	saying okay let's make a tv show so it was like a good-natured cop um going to a analog for Matthew
2177860	2184820	Broderick's character in in um uh fucking not the producer's uh war games um that would be a different
2184820	2189540	show and there was like a cute there was a cute Ali Sheedy type that was like his tomboy kind of
2189540	2196900	like hoodie hoodie wearing a girl friend friend platonic friend yes um until the time where she
2196900	2202900	put a dress on he was like what do you mean I have to wear a dress and let my hair down in
2202900	2209220	order to get this microchip uh from the dance um yeah no and they would like he would he would
2209220	2213700	hack he would hack his refrigerator like like they show they would show him this is how magical
2213700	2219620	people thought computers were they like they would show him like typing in his bedroom and then in
2219620	2226820	the kitchen his refrigerator would open and his mom would go oh and he'd go sorry mom like he's
2227780	2234100	just he's just hacking the refrigerator to open and then he would like hack traffic lights and hack
2234100	2238260	like you know he'd just hack everything but I just read the other day that you can hack a car now
2238260	2242260	because the onboard computers are so complicated that you could actually hack a car and drive it
2242260	2248900	for somebody yeah that's how they killed Michael Hastings what yep the government killed Michael
2248900	2260580	Hastings because he got too close to the truth I remember this I mean he yeah what did he do he
2260580	2266820	just did a lot of really you know really reaching journalism that uh put uh you know uh revealed a
2266820	2272500	lot of corruption and uh oh was that by moza the guy who died by moza yeah no that's the guy and
2272500	2278100	it was the big you know the big burnt patch of grass I know I saw that yeah that's that the
2278100	2284260	government released a statement that said Michael Hastings definitely was not killed by a hacked
2284260	2290980	computer or hackers hacking his computer but just as a completely unrelated public safety note
2290980	2296100	if you were hacked if your computer is hacked and you are killed it would look exactly like this
2296980	2301700	I would reiterate that it is completely they actually said something along those lines it's
2301700	2306500	like this is what it would look like if your car was hacked it would explode like this it didn't
2306500	2311380	happen there'd be no way to know if it happened but we know it didn't happen so it's just like
2311380	2316660	the most weird the most suspicious thing anyone could do you're out there and you're close to
2316660	2322500	the truth maybe get a little further from it that's all we're saying yeah uh this guy got too
2322500	2326580	close to a telephone pole you stay away from the truth stay away from your refrigerator because
2326580	2333300	somebody might know that uh so anyways back then sorry blue blue blue blue the big plot point of
2333300	2339780	your of your of your career is world of warcraft like like because obviously or maybe not obviously
2339780	2346900	for people listening like like the your community uh uh uh the weird metric to use but I'm narcissistic
2346900	2350660	so I'm reading a book and I'm only understanding it through parallels to my life which is happening
2350660	2355060	at the same time like like the world's shittiest biopic would be like cutting back and forth between
2355140	2359140	what's going on with you and what's going on with me and we know we don't know each other but it's
2359140	2362900	like I don't know there would be no reason to do it other than the fact that it structurally works
2362900	2369380	out really perfectly because it's like yeah like during season four your how it's it's it's it's it's
2369380	2376100	it was interesting like reading it but your your your community is based on your community college
2376100	2381460	which is you experiencing world of warcraft and you got seriously like I was surprised at your
2381460	2386340	description of how hard the the addiction was and it sounds on paper just as you're describing
2386340	2391300	in one line like video game addiction first of all you you have a tendency to laugh it off because
2391300	2395140	it seems like a silly thing to be addicted to but second of all with the extent that you do start
2395140	2400500	to take it seriously you would therefore then lose all respect for the game but then I but you weave
2400500	2405140	those highway cones because you're like this is fucking serious shit like I my life guy because
2405140	2409860	it started as a great thing that made you feel good like at a low time in your life you were
2409860	2414180	you were like it started you were you were already trying to act and doing these auditions
2414180	2419300	and you're you're sort of it's not you're not actually expressing yourself you're not close to
2419300	2424580	the truth with your art um and uh and then you start playing world of warcraft and it starts
2424580	2429140	putting you in a good mood and you start feeling like you actually are on honest ground and then
2429140	2432820	all of a sudden it kind of takes over your life and you stop going on an auditions and you stop
2432820	2437220	doing everything and you described it like in a way that made me go oh wow this is real because
2437220	2443220	and I do have I do have friends who the world of warcraft like like like like like took took them
2443220	2453940	out took them off the grid of uh life yeah I mean I mean it was I I mean I've seen that happen
2453940	2458340	obviously it happened to me but but I want to do in my I didn't want I hate it when people are
2458340	2462740	like oh the inherent nature of that video game will ruin a person's life because I think that's
2462740	2468260	bullshit and it's a simple excuse for um for people's problems you could say about putting
2468260	2476180	or exactly a pudding at it I mean I don't overnight bowling night bowling it's really awesome
2478020	2483540	but to me you know I was the irony was when I was actually making a living as an actor a great
2483540	2487860	living like you can work four or five days a year and you're a commercial actor and you can make
2487860	2492180	you can have a great career you make enough money to live and then you have no fulfillment
2492180	2496740	in between and you can only take so many classes or go to coffee with so many actors and complain
2496740	2501140	about your agents before you feel like oh this is not working for me this isn't doing anything good
2501140	2507940	so my brother invited me to play world of warcraft and I was like whoa I'm I'm a warlock and I'm good
2507940	2514500	at this guys and it turned into this thing where I was getting a sense of fulfillment inside by
2515140	2519700	just playing more and more and more and I don't think it's inherently bad and I think
2519700	2525220	there if you can moderate your behavior that it's an amazing social and justifiable social
2525220	2529460	outlet for you and increasingly as we have these online worlds that are as important as
2529460	2535140	our offline worlds you can't denigrate somebody's online life as being escapism or destructive
2535140	2538980	because we're all going to be living in a void one day you know we're all going to be staring
2538980	2544500	at the the construction of our walls that we want to which in my case will be a probably a Normandy
2544500	2549220	castle with some fairy servants and uh you know we're all going to be walled off into these
2549220	2554180	gardens and whether that's good or bad like um you know to me I think that sense of fulfillment
2554180	2559540	that I got connecting to actual people behind those other characters was very important to me
2559540	2564180	and I will always treasure those friendships and those raids and those clothing items that I won
2564180	2568500	on the raids and helmets and things like that but the problem was I didn't have anything to do in my
2568500	2574020	life and I didn't know what to do to get out of the mire of of the acting and to get ahead because
2574100	2578660	as you said I went to college really early I was an you know straight A student and I was like I
2578660	2582180	can't I don't know where else to work hard to get ahead in this business because it's not merit
2582180	2588340	based and um so I just you know World of Warcraft is merit based I was the potion master you know
2588340	2593140	what is it what does rock bottom look like in a World of Warcraft addiction I mean I I remember a
2593140	2599060	couple examples from from your book but I mean it definitely looks like uh having I mean I'm a very
2599060	2602900	organized person I love to-do lists but I would make a to-do list about what I needed to do in
2602900	2609060	the morning to do World of Warcraft better so I would literally have a strict like 8 15 you need
2609060	2614500	to wake up and have a coffee and then wake up log on by 8 30 so you can do a half hour of farming
2614500	2620100	of dream foil and then you have to commute from um ash you know ashara to whatever other region
2620100	2623940	is to get the other herb and then you have to start this herb and I would literally like list
2623940	2628900	it out I had a very comprehensive I would have been a really good wow secretary for my for anybody
2629460	2633540	um but you also described well you said you described your internet going out and you
2633540	2638260	driving around in your car crying because the internet was out yeah yes that's true that
2638260	2643780	happened too and uh yeah so all those things kind of added up to like having two three characters
2643780	2648260	and you know playing 12 14 hours a day and then going to sleep dreaming of being a cartoon
2648260	2652980	character and then waking up with an agenda to be more cartoon characters and um it was inherent
2652980	2659060	and just a place that I was in life that I used that as sort of a a a balm um to fill the hours
2659060	2663780	that I didn't know what else to do with um because I didn't know how to be fulfilled otherwise so I
2663780	2668820	mean I got out of it because I got in a support group which is terrible I hate saying that word
2668820	2676340	it's just so dorky um based on the secret which is even worse but anyway uh it's it actually got me
2676980	2686100	shut up Steve I feel you remember the secret I know nope yeah of course yeah it wasn't that
2686100	2693700	long ago it was it feels like five six years ago yeah and so basically I had this group of women
2693700	2698500	who were like hey come out and share your victories every week and my only victory was like I leveled
2698500	2702980	got a new helm and they were like I don't understand this it's gaming and you justified
2703060	2706980	that by saying you're gonna write a pilot about that world and you eventually did like you have
2706980	2710740	a valley in there where you're like you're like this addiction is more it's not like you're going
2710740	2715380	from the joy of world of warcraft to writing a pilot about it it's like wow me like you're like
2715380	2719220	bottoming out you're like a junkie and world of warcraft but then you get out of it by stopping
2719220	2725220	playing it and writing about it instead and uh as he writes pilot and then like you and your
2725220	2729940	friends from that group based on the secret like I mean it was tangentially I did not know it was
2730020	2733220	based on the secret they read they read like the back cover of the secret and said you can do
2733220	2738100	whatever you want and they're like let's form a group then okay no no don't say was that really
2738100	2742660	the truth because that would be even sadder um no I didn't know it was on the I think it was just
2742660	2747460	tangential in the forming of the group before I was there and I don't mean to now I'm sweating
2747460	2751380	anyway so it was fine it was four or five ladies and every week we'd get together and I wrote the
2751380	2755140	script and nobody wanted to make it because they were like I don't understand how you use a computer
2755140	2760740	to talk to other people with a game because that was you know seven eight years ago and um people
2760740	2766580	were uh not that savvy um and youtube had just started so my friend was like let's shoot it and
2766580	2771540	put it online and that was literally the start of everything I've done um just kind of braving the
2771540	2776500	terror and deciding to pick up a camera and shoot yeah and you hunkered down and like the description
2776500	2782020	of the shit the amount of work that you guys put into that thing well not accepting help from a
2782020	2787780	system that was like well we'll we'll do this but you know we'll own it all and stuff and you
2787780	2793460	you repeatedly kept resisting that urge and were really one of the first I mean because this is
2793460	2798340	back again another you know I'm going like I remember I remember then I wasn't paying any
2798340	2802180	attention to what you were doing because I had my head on my own but it was channel 101 it's like
2802180	2807220	I did a couple of those like randomly and I thought that was I mean I but I never would be
2807220	2811060	I acted in a couple but I never would have been brave enough to pick it up because I didn't have
2811060	2816100	any experience filmmaking you know I mean what you did was like revolutionary in that it was
2816100	2822740	internet video before internet video was a thing right thank you uh yeah channel 101 predated
2822740	2826180	youtube but then you're doing this in like a slightly post youtube world but it's like it's
2826180	2832180	all the beginning and like certainly the idea of a web series like now um that's what color cards
2832180	2837700	is of course about the guild yeah yeah yeah oh thank you we haven't said it yeah my web series
2837700	2843380	was called the guild the guild but yeah I know the yacht rock was one of my favorite things
2843380	2848260	in the world like it's truly a masterpiece of cinema thank you
2851300	2852500	we were in that we were
2854420	2860420	the boards was in it the guild lasted six seasons six years it was six years of videos and we
2860420	2864260	actually weren't on youtube except for the first season so we shot the first three episodes and I
2864260	2868820	tell in dramatic detail about shooting in your house which is not a fun thing because people will
2868820	2874020	go number two in your toilet copiously and then you'll have to clean it later um which is I'm a
2874020	2880740	hypochondriac I don't want anybody else's uh poop in my house and uh I have to say that that's the
2880740	2888180	one chapter where I was like she lost me because of my channel 101 background I'm like I'm like
2888180	2891860	really because of your I would not with not thinking that you're a bad person but just
2891860	2895140	thinking like oh no we might have not been friends or something if we encounter it because
2895140	2899860	I'm like yeah I left the diet coke can under your couch mattress I fucking I was I was boom
2899860	2905620	operating for eight hours like it's your show okay listen I was trying I had to that was actually
2905620	2911140	the hardest chapter to write because I wrote it because I don't know if you you start to believe
2911140	2915860	your own mythology or you're just so used to telling people about the story and I was so
2915860	2920660	grateful and I was like I would list every single person who came for free and my editor was like
2920660	2926100	this is not good like no one I understand that you want to thank the Kenny who is your podcaster
2926100	2930100	who showed up to set every single day and you know um and all these other people that you're
2930100	2935460	listing who volunteered uh Colleen and Bob who were furries and they donated their furry costumes
2935460	2940580	to season five like and I would go in copious lists of trying to thank everybody and then in
2940580	2945060	that chapter she was like you have to be funnier so that was why I took the angle and yes the coke
2945060	2950740	can ring on my dining room table pisses me off because I I had to do like a monk guest star to
2950740	2957300	pay for that table because uh I was gonna go to IKEA but I was like oh I got a guest star I could
2957300	2964580	get a table a real lady table so um that's ironic because monk isn't he doesn't he like
2965940	2970740	Sherlock Holmes but he hates like soda rings on the table yeah he's like you didn't use a coaster
2970740	2977140	you murdered him no I didn't he's like who's who are you gonna believe I'm monk um I've never seen
2977140	2984340	the show but uh you got it he nailed it uh the um but but well I agree with your publisher whoever
2984340	2992260	said that um because you know it's it's a couple of pages or uh 20 minutes of audio during which
2992260	2998980	I'm like well you know come on do you who cares if someone uses a coaster um but you're it's
2998980	3003620	important because you're planning the season because this turns out to be a very actually uh
3004900	3009540	needlessly because it could have been a good book anyway like you're and you're a likable person
3009540	3015140	and you're sharing your story and people want to hear it but you really like crucify yourself
3015140	3019220	like as as it go like you walk all the way up Golgotha with this and it's like it starts with
3019220	3024020	like like you know diet coke rings on the table but you're you're taking that somewhere and like
3024020	3029460	you're very very confessional and thorough about chronicling a nervous breakdown yeah which started
3029460	3034260	way earlier than I ever would have thought and not before I wrote about my story you know I
3034260	3038100	well you use the word panic attack from the beginning like and I was like I wonder if she
3038100	3044580	means real panic attacks or like if she's oh no real ones like I can remember vividly I auditioned
3044580	3048580	for um and this is actually when I kind of broke away from acting and was just like I'm gonna do
3048580	3053220	the web thing for a while I was testing for a show called like Samantha who which was a Christina
3053220	3059140	Applegate show and it was testing against Melissa McCarthy and an Asian girl and I was like and it
3059140	3063940	was Melissa McCarthy before she was Melissa McCarthy and when she was just Asian yeah
3065700	3069460	it's weird she had a lot of surgery it's interesting um I mean her community came
3069460	3073380	down on her so hard about that surgery but it turned out it made her a superstar really did
3074580	3078580	they always say don't get the yeah be true to yourself except don't in Hollywood um
3079220	3084900	but I went in and I tested for that and I literally had such a panic attack that I could not I mean my
3084900	3089380	hand was I'm not kidding it was the most and and when I had a panic attack and I would I noticed
3089380	3092900	you know in in going through a lot of therapy and stuff like that like oh you were plagued
3092900	3097140	with panic attacks your whole life and out of body like kind of looking like wow you're terrible
3097140	3102900	like I could see what you're doing and it's not effective and it was so bad the audition I walked
3102900	3106820	out and it was the most ashamed I've ever felt in my whole entire life and at that point I was
3106820	3112420	just like I think I need to back off and just do um the web more uh but I don't know where I was
3112420	3116740	going with this well you're very traumatic oh the it's the guild that starts to consume you
3116740	3123300	ironically you create this thing and and again I I relate to this like you're you're you're at the
3123300	3128500	height of your you know your your your story goes from a meeting with the goddess which is like
3128500	3133380	comic con you're hanging out with Joss Whedon and you're like I can't believe I built myself without
3133380	3138260	permission you use the phrase without permission it's like yeah exactly like like I did this without
3138260	3145380	permission um and and then like the the second half starts to take because it's if you haven't
3145380	3149940	like checked in about this like compulsion you know this engine like if the whole time everyone's
3149940	3153460	just going like go go get them go get them and you're the whole time you have like these little
3153460	3158420	ghosts in your head so then you start to get with nothing else to destroy you but yourself you start
3158500	3163700	to destroy yourself a little bit yeah I mean you know essentially I mean we were shooting for six
3163700	3167860	seasons and it seems like oh you're so I mean we were successful he had a little bit of a budget
3167860	3172660	but essentially we were making extremely low budget movie in my house for six years I was
3172660	3177460	the only writer to ever write on the guild and it was so and and not only with that that I did all
3177460	3181060	the social media all the marketing all the appearances all the coordination I mean I would
3181060	3186180	be on the phone like trying to get the cast to a convention like where are you okay I'll go meet
3186180	3191460	you outside with a badge like there was no possible way to delegate in my behavior as well
3191460	3196260	as just not having resources I mean we had no resources so it looks like we got fancier every
3196260	3200100	year but we when we did because everybody's expectation was higher but we really had no more
3200100	3204580	resources or support to make it bigger and basically I did it by just literally working
3204580	3210900	myself almost to death and um and and I would never trade that for anything but um I I don't
3210900	3215060	I don't know if it was the most healthy way to do things because when I started adding other things
3215060	3220260	on um like a company and other projects like that's when I really started to collapse yeah so
3220260	3227300	I I guess I I haven't collapsed yet but I don't know if I'm gonna lately lately because yeah then
3227300	3231460	I was like then the parallels stopped because you're like oh I figured this out and I'm like
3231460	3236260	wait how did you figure that out like because you're like because the doctors said like you're
3236260	3240500	getting like horrible heartburn that could put you at heightened risk of esophageal cancer and
3240500	3244500	you're like well wait a minute that's my deal breaker I'm not gonna affect my I'll be crazy
3244580	3248580	but I'm not gonna let it affect my body so then you just decided to stop being crazy and I'm like
3248580	3255220	what I mean I just not if I phrased it like that I'm definitely still crazy guys what you said that
3255220	3260740	I can't understand is that you you you know you realize that the I don't paraphrasing you but
3260740	3266660	you realize that the things you do are not who you are that that is a realization that I
3266660	3271620	intellectually understand and sometimes I feel it in my heart but I don't know especially if
3271620	3275860	you're a business where you are something to someone that you're not somebody like if you're
3275860	3281700	in a position where somebody knows you and that's fame and you know like what small amount that I
3281700	3288340	have and in very interesting areas but like the minute you are in a situation where your work is
3288340	3294660	basically in that kind of external validation is important to getting what you want done I think
3294660	3299140	that starts to mess with your head and your value starts to kind of like be sucked out onto your
3299140	3306100	skin your outer self I don't know is that weird what I can't get too weird for me in this area I
3306100	3311460	mean I don't know like I'm a full-blown like I didn't know because other work my therapist just
3311460	3316980	starts to use this word workaholic and I'm like well doesn't that mean productive like I'm not
3319540	3326580	and it doesn't it doesn't any more than alcoholic means like for you know uh fun drunk or you know
3326580	3331380	it's like you can be something aholic and it doesn't have to be like a super great version of
3331380	3335780	it and I guess I've always I'm like I this is a serious problem for me like that I have to
3335780	3340340	confront now that's like the root of everything that's going wrong in my life what are you doing
3340340	3345140	I just I'm just I don't have I don't have an identity outside of what I do at all like like
3345140	3353060	this show is like like is a huge part of keeping me sane because it's a way for me to to to do
3353060	3361620	something while that involves being human and and fulfilling myself but but like so like because
3361620	3366820	I don't I don't you know I play like sort of my therapist she's like what do you do to recharge
3366820	3371540	what do you do to fill up what do you do to relax as I play video games yeah she's like okay so what
3371540	3376020	do you do in the video games and I go well you know I'm like a witcher and I mean yeah there's
3376020	3380980	a lot of shit to be solved there these peasants are really put upon so how is that different if
3381060	3385780	I if the if the if the ghoul is uh is a guy from dreamworks how is this different from
3387460	3391540	from from the life you just described that's incredibly stressful and I said well okay I
3391540	3394500	guess that you're right that we don't think that would make a good movie
3395540	3399540	I don't I don't think that's a good comparison though because it's like you have you met this
3399540	3405620	guy from dreamworks oh I'm just saying sports sports are very intense you could get really
3405620	3409700	worked up and stressed out just playing sports but no one would say you're gonna stop playing
3409700	3414340	sports man that's cutting into well I think that those people exert exert themselves and also
3415220	3420180	there are probably people who shouldn't be using sports because it does stress them out
3420180	3425540	but I think that I think that typically people who do physical things they get they exert themselves
3425540	3429700	and then they physically like have a catharsis you know because they wear themselves out and then
3429700	3434340	they go and they have no choice but to but to take those big deep breaths and relax themselves
3434340	3439220	and set their nervous system back to zero but where I I don't because I I know she's right
3439220	3445060	because I know for a fact that when I'm sitting down to play a video game while I'm absolutely
3445060	3449860	like I can't wait to do it so you would you so then you think oh I'm doing this to take a break
3449860	3455940	or relax but I'm just like I'm just using it to avoid like I'm using what else are you gonna do
3455940	3460660	that's a valid thing to do I mean that's what I'm saying I get pissed off I'm like okay therapist
3460660	3467060	what do you do you watch the good wife every night well I mean how the fuck how is that better
3467060	3473540	than actually participating in a story and projecting yourself as a really hot well if
3473540	3479060	I said that my therapist would say well I curl up in the I don't watch tv and I don't use facebook
3479060	3486100	I curl up in the arms of my lesbian wife and I'd be like I wrote it she probably she probably
3486180	3493540	really does like watch sunsets and shit I mean how is that better listen I I mean well because
3493540	3500340	it's two lesbians doing it first of all okay well so how is it worse I mean I think I I think that
3500340	3504980	if you find a sense of meaning in something and yes I sometimes you just want a little bit of
3504980	3510020	emptiness like that's what tv's about like well I think the difference is it's like stimulation
3510020	3515540	versus like like coffee's a stimulant and then pot like kind of makes you giggle and fall asleep
3515540	3522900	like I think that she just wants you to have more lesbian pot yeah yeah um that's the scissoring
3522900	3528340	thing right the the the I think I know I think she's I think it's accurate I mean it's like I
3528340	3532340	wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't believe if there wasn't some truth to what she's saying
3532340	3536340	like I wouldn't believe it but I think because I'm I'm miming like an xbox controller in my hand
3536340	3540900	and I'm like I'm like it's it's like I was like oh I'm gonna now I'm gonna do this because it's
3540900	3546500	like I want to like I want to jump over to doing the same thing but numb my brain yeah I don't I'm
3546500	3552820	not like taking in I'm not like refilling my soul but what is I don't know how you do that I don't
3552820	3557060	know how you do that I don't I mean I think it's relative like what are you supposed to learn French
3557060	3563380	or go to go to meet friends I find it so ponderous to go out there's not a point to it yeah I mean
3563380	3567140	like if we're not playing board games or bowling I don't understand how I'm just supposed to sit
3567140	3573700	there with a drink in my hand and talk more than 30 minutes I don't know should I see your therapist
3573700	3577460	do you want to see her yeah I don't know now I'm sweating because maybe I don't want to step
3577460	3582980	than I thought can I can I can I just bring you in and like a box and uh and she'll be like what's
3582980	3586820	in the box I'm like just some more work and she goes hmm workaholic still playing those video games
3586820	3591700	and we're like yeah tell me what you were saying before again and she's like hmm you gotta you gotta
3591700	3595780	hang out with your wife and just watch the sunset and then I'll open the box and you'll be like hello
3597140	3603220	hello I have an opinion I got a bone to pick if I were playing video games I would honestly be
3603220	3607940	I would be I would I would think that I don't feel alive if I was not learning something so
3607940	3612660	I would be like I'm learning French or Esperanto or I learned Mandarin Chinese for six months
3612660	3619460	because I needed to go to the gym and it sounded good to do that and I is that true I did and I
3619460	3625700	watched a Jet Li movie and I picked out seven words and I was like my god I'm amazing I'm so amazing
3626260	3628100	but they were words like Coca-Cola
3629860	3631940	baseball Tom Selleck
3633380	3642420	night bowling and punch yeah uh yeah well I know I'm gonna this is a big topic to me I want to
3642420	3646820	figure this out but I think that you and I both don't have the answer but I mean isn't that just
3646820	3652820	retirement I don't know I I mean I would I would I would feel like I was wasting my life if I was
3652820	3657140	just I mean looking at a sunset is nice but it doesn't need to be all the time it should be a
3657140	3665780	treat and it does always just set like that's all it does if it was yeah boo like like these
3665780	3671060	supermoon people like they're not gonna be relaxed tonight no that's literally some bit werewolf is
3671060	3676420	assaulting an old woman right now because of that moon that's a that's a big problem in LA
3676420	3686180	that we're not we're not talking about enough um silver like beards um yeah it'd be awesome if
3686180	3691700	I'm sorry I'm a little high but it'd be awesome if you made a like a jet that went the exact
3691700	3698180	speed that the earth rotates and you could literally just follow a fucking sunset around
3698180	3707220	the world for until you ran out of gas that would be possible wait is that like a is it
3707220	3713540	like a I miss the top is like a chair is it you make a jet and you could just chase and it was
3713540	3719940	like solar powered so you just never had to fucking stop and I did you're just you're just
3719940	3726900	johnny sunset you just always yeah isn't that Apollo like the greek myth of Apollo is that he
3726980	3733220	did I don't know I know I think I think Apollo's myth is that he had a wagon with the sun as the
3733220	3739300	wheel oh I mean I don't know if he Aurora there is there is a god they were a hot god who had
3739300	3745060	sex with animals did that sounds like Apollo promise um no but the thing that I do for
3745060	3749860	relaxation by the way that I feel centered is I watch house hunters and I see all these
3749860	3754660	stupid bastards who get to quit their job and move to Denmark because they've always wanted to
3754740	3758900	and I'm like I want to do one day I'm going to do that and then I feel like I've centered myself
3758900	3764660	that sounds stressful but I but I think I know what you're talking about when I watch intervention
3764660	3765780	I'm always like oh there you go
3770580	3777860	forensic files for me I had never seen one until about two months ago I was in Baltimore in a hotel
3777860	3782660	because you're like watching it at least I could not fucking stop watching forensic what is it I've
3782660	3791140	never seen it it it's a fan right there you know really hard to solve cases and they break down
3791140	3797140	how they eventually solve them you know they use luminol every time and then and then every once
3797140	3802500	in a while they can't use luminol because uh the criminal had used a technique to make it
3802580	3805700	luminol proof which this show cannot disclose bleach
3811860	3817460	I like they're that worried about about their show having that effect but it's like come on
3817460	3820980	what I'm learning from your show is if you're going to murder someone own a boat like like
3821940	3826260	like nobody no crime uh Ashonda rhymes
3830260	3837300	wait yeah there's so wait somebody else has a uh leon nobody no crime leon rhymes now that's
3837300	3842580	the same syllables what's luminol luminol is it just blood detector it's like you if I kill you
3843220	3848820	uh or if that guy kills you let's uh the guy in the pokemon hat you can mop up all the blood
3848900	3853140	and it looks you know it looks like it's gone but then they spray luminol and they shine a black
3853140	3858420	light and it's just like oh there's all this blood it detects the iron or something like that
3858420	3862820	that's good to know is that new that didn't have that with murder she wrote well well she didn't
3862820	3868900	need it she had mental luminol it's true do you ever see Angela Lansbury and the queen of shiba
3868900	3874900	and like the 60 she was hot as she was really what she was beautiful she she played the queen
3874900	3880100	of shiba it was it like Cleopatra or was it queen of shiba i don't remember but i've seen
3880100	3885220	photos of her young and she was really good looking yeah yeah anyway i thought you meant
3885220	3893060	like her babies her young yeah yeah what are you talking about you guys oh shit you didn't bring
3893060	3898180	your book out here did you i did i didn't bring it but i got her books in the uh in the green room
3898180	3902900	because because because a big oh not a big part of your story but of the recent part of your story
3902900	3908500	and we don't have to talk it's it's it's it's gotten boring to talk about uh it's my book
3910340	3915620	it's a new york times bestseller so they can't take that away from me ever which is pretty awesome
3915620	3919220	we could talk about gamergate for an hour and just suck the energy out of the room
3919220	3923700	which i which i which i don't think is a fair legacy to uh it's 9 11 by the way yeah
3924180	3926180	um
3927540	3931460	i don't want you to get the wrong impression but we just we get excited about it um
3933540	3938100	but but would you mind reading like you have you have passages in your book because i think it's
3938100	3944740	funny and also empowering and and kind of subversive of the intent of people who who
3944740	3951540	who come after people under the banner of uh of of of of online like i mean i could read the
3951540	3957220	beginning of just that chapter just about some yeah i mean like yeah leading up to the i thought
3957220	3961220	oh man she should read this out loud because it's sort of like because i'm listening to you on the
3961220	3967380	audiobook and hearing you read the comments that people leave the intention being for you to like
3967380	3972660	i mean the way that they speak you would think that their intent was for you to just go and hang
3972660	3977780	yourself or quit forever or judge you know it's like and it's it is it's weird the internet is
3977780	3984900	such a sewer and then it's so like like for when people get so specific and so targeted it's like
3984900	3991220	wait are you when i when i heard you reading this stuff out loud that i kept thinking like oh this
3991220	3996580	must be their worst nightmare because these are their words and they're supposed to like somehow
3996580	4001060	well they have a lot of imager pictures of how it's not completely their words except it's just
4001060	4006100	one tweet and then of course that discredits my whole argument but um but there must be what we
4006100	4009860	know of these people like i think it didn't orwell have some quote about if you look at the way
4009860	4013460	people the weapons they use to attack people then you know everything that scares them
4013460	4020260	like it's just almost sort of an uplifting like fairy tale irony to it when you see people go
4020260	4025380	after people that hard and that viciously because you know even though it seems cartoonish you know
4025380	4030340	that that means that there's something you could say to them that would make them cry yeah i mean
4030340	4034660	i've found i mean the funny thing is before that whole incident happened last year i had finished
4034740	4039860	my draft in my book and there was a chapter about negative comments which if i i'll just read just
4039860	4044260	the first part in some of the nasty tweets that are out of context of that incident particularly
4044260	4050340	because i'd rather just not give them more uh coverage but um and so the chapter existed
4050340	4055540	about trying to weather negativity online and how especially because the roots of that particular
4055540	4062260	incident that was just a confluence of a bunch of um you know uh basically it was a chant attack
4062260	4066420	mixed with some conservatism that gave it a label mixed with men's right activists and it
4066420	4071140	was like a swirling vertex of literally the worst of everything coming together to me that's my
4071140	4076980	perspective and um and and so but the roots of it were sort of a backlash like we were talking about
4076980	4081540	before of gamer girls and i'm sure we've all seen those memes uh from like three or four years ago
4081540	4087620	like gamer girl said and it's this girl with the little chunky glasses like mine and uh and it's
4087620	4091940	basically mocking her and saying that essentially that this girl is adopting these things because
4092340	4099140	somehow um she's trying to get attention or be uh make these gamer guys as sexually attracted to
4099140	4104420	her but she's really a fake so um that was really i think the roots of sort of this festering thing
4104420	4108900	that built up over the years that kind of exploded in that incident particular but like i've
4108900	4115140	experienced a lot of this in the chapter before um this haven't happened and it really you know
4115140	4120020	several times i i really did want to quit you know i did not want to make videos anymore and
4120020	4124980	i believed them because underneath if you're an artist you're kind of insecure so when you have
4124980	4131620	that many people on mass get together and say hey you're horrible um and i'll read you know just a
4131620	4136500	little bit at the top uh yeah it's a good time to quit if you're not having a great day exactly
4136500	4143220	yeah exactly um so i guess i could read just one page or something like that um uh okay i have a
4143220	4148180	folder labeled hate folder yeah this is this is the one i interrupted you to to to say
4151140	4156180	i got it right guys i've nailed it um i'm a hate folder labeled hate folder that sits in the middle
4156180	4160500	of my desktop it's where i save screenshots of the worst things people have said to me online
4160500	4165620	50 shades of felicia um for some reason it takes the sting away to hurt all the toxic comments into
4165620	4169940	the hoarder corner of my hard drive aggregating the losers i'd like to hunt down in real life
4169940	4175540	and run over with a dump truck then back up again and run over them again too far huh okay
4176260	4179940	if it's too disgusting to say to another human being i guarantee that someone has said it to
4179940	4184980	me online the internet is amazing because it connects us with one another but it's also horrific
4184980	4191380	because it connects us with one another whether we uh want the connection or not the only real
4191380	4196500	life analogy i can think of is if a random person were to allow to walk into your home punch you in
4196500	4200340	the face while you're eating your oatmeal then walk out again with no fear of consequences
4200340	4206100	after one incident you'd be looking for a new zip code wouldn't you so uh here's some fun examples
4206100	4210740	of the human often list i've collected over the years at felicia day a woman using her sexuality
4210740	4214740	to profit from male gamers and pretending she's empowering women and progressing quote unquote
4214740	4221300	gaming culture her nose is so fucked up did someone hit it with a sledgehammer or what
4221300	4225460	at felicia day congratulations you have a vagina and play video games now do something useful
4226900	4232580	that's my favorite formula by the way it's like like i like i don't have a vagina and people uh
4232580	4237780	tell me i do and it's really no uh no but like like like the people like like if i talk about
4237780	4242340	minecraft too much someone someone eventually i'll go we get it you're a celebrity and you
4242340	4247220	and you do nerdy stuff get over yourself i'm like what the fucking fuck today somebody
4247220	4251220	what are you talking about yeah they called me the kim gurdashian of nerddom and i'm like
4252020	4257860	i'm not nearly that successful but it's that we get it thing that's like you should be allowed to
4257860	4261780	you that doesn't make any sense like hey steve we get it you get a cap on and you're sitting
4261780	4271060	behind a microphone like it just sounds like been there done that oh we get it your motor you're
4271060	4276900	lowering your mic oh we get it the caps back on i can't win oh we get it you can't win
4276900	4282660	it's not fair it's like it's like the agent orange of like well it's almost like people
4282660	4286260	people who are probably shamed for what they love trying to shame somebody else for those
4286260	4292660	exact same things it's it's a little bit uh unproductively uh and ironic but in hurtful
4292660	4297860	it really is hurtful because i think um at the end end of the day like i i am who i am because
4297860	4303540	i was rejected a lot and i never felt like i belonged anywhere and now that i've been able
4303620	4308420	to break out of that and and show people that it's acceptable and be be i guess more mainstream or
4308420	4313860	more visible than i have people telling me that hey um you're just a sellout and you're pandering
4313860	4319780	and you don't believe any of this or um you're useless and your nose let's see uh if you honestly
4319780	4326500	think felicia day worked hard to get where she is eat a bowl of fucking nails that's not that's
4326500	4334180	not even the worst ultimatum yeah like it really is eating nails eat a bowl oh fine i mean i'll get
4334180	4343380	by it's not like yeah yeah sorry everybody he's bad at insults spencer grew up on a farm and he
4343380	4348340	has one of those cylindrical super magnets in his stomach oh really because he because he grazes by
4348340	4355860	the fence posts he eats a lot of nails it's just a fact of life on in simi valley and i get through
4355860	4360820	it so he thinks everyone has a magnet in their stomach that lets them eat nails well anybody
4360820	4367700	could that's what counts that's all i'm saying i have a lot of conspiracy websites i really don't
4367700	4372820	i didn't even earlier a couple episodes ago we asked if i had any conspiracy theories and i was
4372820	4379700	like nope but apparently i have one michael haystings no no i think most conspiracies are kind of
4379700	4384900	you know they well everyone knows about conspiracy conspiracies they work backward from the result
4384900	4390020	they want to achieve yeah do you want me to read more of this yeah i think there's a c-word coming
4390020	4393220	right oh yeah yeah you want me to read more of them are you gonna get me to say this word on
4393220	4398580	okay um why do gamer girls always use the nerd the term nerdy geek and gamer can't felicia day
4398580	4402660	just shut the fuck up she's nothing but an attention whore that uses her gender for as a
4402660	4407220	key for attention tell me would you have subscribed to this channel if felicia day wasn't a girl if
4407220	4413140	you say yes you're a fucking idiot someone tell that red-headed cunt that the kitchen's down the
4413140	4423300	hall not front of the hammer all right that's a that's that's like a 16 year old using like uh
4423300	4428820	like 1960s cat skill like comedy that he would if his dad said that he'd be like dad
4430260	4434820	you know father knows best you could see like uh frank uh what what is that guy's name
4435460	4441540	frank fred murray i hate him he's dead right that's my three sons fred McMurray is fred McMurray
4441540	4448340	father knows best was um robert young robert young okay so that was no that's freddy kruger
4448340	4452900	did you know that did you know that fred McMurray never was in the same room with those children
4452900	4457700	though like he would shoot his three sons yes he would shoot all of his scenes in advance
4457700	4462580	like in a separate unit and then it would be a double with most of the things he come into
4462580	4468340	that was william frolly who was the also in the show but he oh it was william frolly yeah
4468900	4474660	why did he do it did he hate children he just didn't want to do the show or he would yeah he
4474660	4479860	would shoot all his stuff out in like you know like a couple days they would just fake it all
4479860	4485860	right well let's spread another rumor that's not true felicia about 50s dead people can you just
4485860	4491940	pick to do that you're like uh fuck all these other actors i'll just just put me in a box and
4491940	4496740	didn't that happen on the good wife though the good wife she's cgi'd the last scene oh yeah heard
4496740	4506500	about that yeah those monsters not the women the cgiers anyway cgiers do you want me to read
4506500	4510820	more i don't know if you have any favorites no i feel like i'm putting you through i know it's
4510820	4516020	meat grinders now no i'll totally read i mean essentially the rest of it is oh no yeah i mean
4516020	4519860	it's it's there were the good the good one there's a tweets like i you know i'll see something like
4519860	4523860	that every day but then i'll see hundreds of more positive comments and you know the cool thing is
4523860	4528660	that i just went on book tour and i went to 13 cities and you know going out in the world is
4528660	4534500	strange to me um and but the coolest thing was there were so many guys who came up and bought
4534500	4538820	the book and they were like i'm buying this for my niece who's 13 or i'm buying this for my daughter
4538820	4544660	who's 16 and i just loved the idea that there were these fathers and and guys who were didn't
4544660	4549620	really know what to do for these girls who were at this age that you probably would abandon the
4549620	4554020	cool things that you might love like you know gaming or anything anything that made them feel
4554020	4560820	less popular or likable um that they wanted to give them any tool that they could find to be as
4560820	4565140	who they are and i think that was the cool thing to reset things to the way they were in 1983 when
4565140	4571860	it was like yeah look we're too nerdy to be caring about something that are like our world war two
4571860	4579380	like like right now i'm no i'm denigrating vets we met tahano stars next harm and john a bunch of guys
4579380	4583700	come up with like the caps and they're just like uh why and they're like what either like why did
4583700	4588580	you say that you're terrible we fought for your country um no but i was i'm just saying like that
4588580	4593620	that era it's like why are these like like we're debt we can't possibly are nerds that successful
4593620	4598340	now that we're able to like split down into like camps and i don't think so i think these are
4598340	4601940	people that are having a bad day or something and they're like because it seems like from what
4601940	4607700	they're saying it's just almost like comedically over targeted like to me well some of the worst
4607700	4612420	things i hear are when people are like you know it's the whole meh thing it's like like that's
4612420	4617140	it's like well who cares like fuck you i'm bored with you or what you know if you really if you
4617140	4622340	really really really do dislike somebody well i always say like the opposite of uh love isn't
4622340	4629540	hate it's apathy like it's it's the silence that hurts people like us uh more than the attention
4629540	4635060	and it's the i mean when you when you like come after somebody i just think i think that it's so
4635060	4640180	it's so the thing that's really weird about it is because i i have a 15 year old misogynistic
4640180	4644580	little prick inside of me i can access it and i have one in the trunk of my car too
4647220	4649060	i have jars of them in my basement
4649860	4656500	but but like i i can i can i can run that simulator it's not that it's not like the
4656500	4661780	circuitry that isn't able to go down there with a couple of switch flips and and when i run that
4661780	4667620	simulation i'm like like the thing that outrages me is like why is everybody trying to make
4667620	4672980	something that's like mine and personal and fucking awesome and it's all about being radical
4672980	4680420	and honeycomb hat out um like like what is all this bullshit talk about apologizing and
4680420	4685700	backpedaling and sensitivity and all this shit it's like it's just like like and it's the weird
4685700	4692020	thing is no one no one had to be doing that until and it's just like this weird syndrome okay the
4692020	4697780	culture grew to the point where okay there's points of overlap where somebody says something
4697860	4702980	and then somebody reacts in a weird way and then it requires like the talk about sensitivity it
4702980	4708260	requires all that stuff it's like you ruined it you know like like like like the the person who
4708260	4713780	has that complaint it's like it's like you it now it's necessary for somebody who wants their niece
4713780	4719220	to grow up in a in a you know in a in an environment where she can flourish they have the
4719220	4725220	responsibility on them to do things like stand behind you publicly if you get doxed or whatever
4725220	4730340	and say like this is fucked up and you guys are fucked up and fuck you adam baldwin and whatever
4730340	4737460	like like like let's do it i got you i got you i got your back uh um the the it's now it's like
4737460	4742420	because if you don't now you're like well it just pisses me off because i'm always the kind of
4742420	4748020	person who i like to be genderless in a sense that i am i'm not putting you know a gender
4748020	4753540	like a mending girl game like that's not something that i need to do because that essentially gives
4753540	4759860	gamer to the default to guys right so that's just the way i think i don't but but but what
4759860	4764580	kind of enrages me is that there is an increasing need for women to have their own e-sports league
4764580	4768980	or women to have their own thing in order to be and they've shown studies that makes women more
4768980	4774100	confident to participate in things that are not traditionally women uh female driven which i'm
4774100	4779140	like no just get up there be one of the guy you know be there and be equal and be represented as
4779140	4784340	a person but there is this need on the internet especially when you're in little ecosystems to
4784340	4789300	to call people other you know oh your other your race is different your sexuality is different your
4789300	4793860	gender is different and you should be ashamed of the differences that is essentially where the
4793860	4799380	the kind of power i guess is motivated um because there are different kinds of people coming into
4799380	4802820	the these worlds and then you have people saying we should be hypersensitive to the differences
4802820	4806820	and then you have other people going like i'm hypersensitive to the idea of hypersensitivity
4806820	4810580	well yes and then it's like it's just like round and fucking round we go because it's when the it's
4810580	4815620	when the it's when the frustrated like like semi-moderate people who had nothing but
4816260	4821220	suppressible rage that could have could have remained suppressed until they were 40 but there
4821220	4825620	you know it's coming out because they're like they're being asked to pick a side and an issue
4825620	4830580	that doesn't have to be an issue like the whole every it's almost like everyone is agreeing that
4830580	4834580	we don't want to live in a world where we have to have the fucking conversation 24 hours well that
4834580	4840180	was the whole thing i wrote a blog post about you know uh it was a kind of an essay about how
4840180	4844740	at the height of gamergate like we need to stop doing this and we all love gaming and we need to
4844740	4849140	show a positive face and when i saw you know because of so much hatred that i was getting
4849140	4853060	i was like you know i saw some guys in some gamer shirts and i would assume that we would have been
4853060	4856900	like yeah high five and then i was just like i don't want to deal with it i crossed the street
4856900	4861620	you know just kind of and it was almost unconscious and i realized because people really attacking me
4861620	4866580	and shaming me and that these those kind of comments were like 20 times you know at the
4866580	4872660	height of that incident i i was subconsciously changing my behavior based on someone basically
4872660	4876420	fucking up what i love a culture that i love and something that i love and i've always wanted to
4876420	4881300	spread the love of and show people hey gaming i mean i spent the most time rewriting the real
4881300	4885700	world of warcraft thing because i really wanted to show people how awesome it was to play mmos
4885700	4890100	and how fun it could be and somebody's aunt could read it and understand why their you know nephew
4890100	4895300	would like these kind of things so during that that's why i wrote that essay which led to people
4895300	4900500	posting my address online and a lot of people now just saying i'm afraid of gamers which is like
4900500	4905140	literally the opposite of what i said factually right and your thesis wasn't even this is another
4905140	4909060	misunderstanding when people talk about these subjective subjective experiences they're not
4909060	4915300	saying um this thing happened to me that is a crime that needs to be punished they're saying
4915300	4921460	this is the experience that is happening to me subjectively and i you know i i am a big fat
4922020	4928340	straight white bearded male at a middle age that has never had anything but good fortune but
4928340	4934980	being in the spotlight it's nothing to complain about even the negative parts of it but it is
4936260	4943380	when you know when you've like run a foul of the public and people are tweeting at you around the
4943380	4948660	clock you should kill yourself no one likes you why the fuck are you in my newspaper you dumb
4948660	4955860	piece of shit um the guy was fletched why are you doing this um like like like and it's just like
4955860	4961380	it it erodes at your psyche and there's nothing to i deserved it like and it's but i but it's
4961380	4969060	important to note like how how much it freaks you the fuck out so if you do happen to be like me
4969060	4975220	but have a vagina and have people that have wieners like saying like adding that edge to it
4975220	4979620	where they're like i know where you live i'm gonna fucking kill you i had somebody yesterday
4979620	4985140	like at a convention and this this guy came up and it was like i i i love the furniture in your
4985140	4989860	house and like and at the time you know you're signing i'm signing hundreds of autographs i'm
4989860	4994340	like you know that makes me uncomfortable and i'm like and i sign and i go away and i and i
4994340	4998100	then i looked at that guy the handler with me i was like did you just really say that
4998100	5002980	and then i'm like okay a he's trying to freak me out because he's trying to use the you know
5002980	5007860	just either he's a a troll and he's like look what i did guys i went up and you know said this
5007860	5012980	or you know there's a possibility like could somebody have a camera like it has to go through
5012980	5016740	my mind because i've literally had people in my house i have restraining orders against people
5016740	5022100	who are you know have taken it so far and to imply that those kind of threats aren't as
5022100	5027220	you know emotionally damaging and also potentially threatful especially if you're in a public uh in
5027220	5030900	a public forum and anybody on the internet can find where you live like right this is a real
5030900	5035140	thing there's been actual dudes in your house yeah that's not something that's not the thing
5035140	5039700	that you're when you write that blog entry you're that's not what you're you don't you don't lead
5039700	5044020	with that that's not the badge you're wearing it's not about crimes committed and recompense
5044020	5048100	needing to be done you're saying the in that in that blog entry you're going how did this
5048100	5052580	fucking happen to our culture yeah everybody needs to stop being hateful because you're making gamers
5052580	5058180	look like assholes like that's what the point of that was and and especially from a point of like
5058180	5063380	we we all love this together let's figure it out and agree to disagree with respect because
5063380	5067620	it just got to the point where it was crazy and thank goodness a lot of people have spoken up
5067620	5072660	especially leaders in the in in gaming and like gaming companies are taking it seriously and it
5072660	5078500	just like to me i love it and i want people to know that gaming is amazing and you know that
5078500	5082260	really is the future of our entertainment is gaming i just went to the thing called the void
5082260	5086900	and literally i put on some an oculus and a backpack and i ran through a maze and i thought
5086900	5092580	i was in like a sky room i'm not kidding look up the void it really i did it in person it might be
5092580	5097140	the most amazing thing i've ever experienced and i realized we are going to be living in all worlds
5097140	5102100	that intersect with nobody else's or we will be adventuring truly in the worlds that we want to
5102100	5107780	escape to now just in passive fiction and in 20 years it's gonna be crazy have you put on the valve
5107780	5111940	thing the valve thing is nothing compared to this because i was actively running through
5113460	5119860	i'm not i'm not kidding okay well i've died the valve is the top that i've experienced so far
5119860	5126180	just look up the void are you on what is treadmills no no no it's a literal no it's like uh it's like
5126180	5130180	a paintball arena this guy knows just look up the void it's like it got three million views on it
5130180	5136660	and wait is it ar vr or tr it's v it's vr it's like a holodeck so you have an oculus on which
5136660	5142180	is not it's not it's like a customized oculus and a backpack basically and you put it on and
5142180	5146660	you turn it on and you literally step through a portal and you're in an indiana jones ruins or
5146660	5151620	you're on a spaceship and it feels and you're shooting it's not hard to stand up i noticed
5151620	5156580	with the first time i tried oculus rift when it first came out it would make me really nauseous
5156580	5160500	same with me this one you're literally walking through and and there's so basically they're
5160500	5164980	skinning they're skinning the walls and they're skinning seats so that if you look at a seat like
5164980	5171060	it's a green block right in reality or like a gray block but in my in my oculus it looks like
5171060	5176820	uh an archaeology archaeological tomb and really you could feel it and it looks like you're feeling
5176820	5181060	i'm not kidding guys there's a fire they have a heater yeah there's a fire they also have a wind
5181060	5186340	so you look out on a waterfall and you have wind in your face and you in the game think you are
5186340	5192260	looking at a goddamn waterfall and there's a there's a salad bar and it's got yeah it has uh
5192900	5197860	and there's a there's a there's real salad in there but then but to you it looks like chilled
5197860	5207780	monkey brains i remember the snake surprise remember that guy in temple of doom that guy
5207780	5214420	loved scary food i was like sir have you ever had a snickers bar like you would have been great on
5214420	5219380	fear factor i understand the idea is that there's cultural definitions and some things that are
5219380	5226260	scary to us maybe you find delicate but but but but these are baby snakes slithering around
5226260	5231060	and i understand even maybe you'd go oh i like to eat these you know i'm used to them but he's like
5231060	5242340	snake surprise yeah like he's so he can't he's like chilled monkey brains oh i'm like i feel
5242420	5249780	like you're protesting like like like like so so if i bring the the the the wet the wedge iceberg
5249780	5253940	you know the iceberg wedge over to you with just some nice ranch on it would he go like
5255700	5257540	it's just no monkey brains
5260020	5266260	maybe did you do the valve oculus with the kitchen though did you do that yeah what did you
5266260	5271300	automatically do when you open the fridge uh i broke all the eggs i threw him into the wall
5271300	5277940	well i i can't i do he dropped a carrot in the pot you know well i also that's all he did i also
5277940	5283460	and and everybody under 18 like uh plug your ears not for what you what you think but i just
5283460	5290340	want to share something with uh my my my fellow my generation buddy uh i i within three minutes i
5290340	5297220	was i i i was trying to slit my throat with the knife wow i was like i was like
5298500	5302820	see if you could do it yeah i was just like well that's a real knife like like but it's not

5309460	5314900	fucking i'm making soup no i i wish you were here which i was trying to explain that to jeff
5314980	5320020	davis who's usually sits over there and and he's like what what is it like the croutons are real

5326020	5331380	saying you're making two people put on vr goggles and go into the same space no i was in there i
5331380	5336100	was in the void with another person and i saw the halo that she was kind of in a halo and she was
5336100	5339380	shooting and i was shooting i was like there's a spider behind you and i was shooting her and she
5339460	5347060	was like there was not friendly fire basically in that situation oh no but that's the next
5347060	5351380	start i mean does that make you as a storyteller like want to tell something like do something
5351380	5357700	storytelling the e in that are you okay i don't even know get ready for a surprise
5359860	5369060	thanks thanks thanks bill thanks uh everyone born in 1973 thank you total recall the original
5369060	5375380	um the uh it no it really freaks me out it excites me and kind of scares me because i'm like
5375380	5381860	oh my god since the lumière brothers we have been like every all storytelling has been like
5381860	5391780	through a two-dimensional pain and it's like yeah chorizo lumière everybody uh it's her birthday
5391780	5399860	she's 130 years young she was the she was the dp on horse walking out of a warehouse
5403140	5404660	please put your hands together for
5408820	5416180	the diva of of oh wait no the femme the femme of fuck it does it feel like an illiterate the femme
5416180	5425620	fatale of photography um the uh the uh uh uh uh storytelling well yeah because it's like um
5425620	5429620	like oh this is so exciting but then i'm like oh if anything puts me out of business it's
5429620	5433140	like that's like i might not be able to make that leap might not listen how pretentious i am
5435220	5440500	evil can evil might not make that canyon that might be the grandest canyon of all
5441460	5447860	i may have to hang up my american flag helmet uh they thought bigfoot would get me but
5449620	5455620	that's a six million dollar main reference uh the uh yeah it's weird because what's going to happen
5455620	5462340	is we're going to understate where you're going to have to write stories even more so like like
5462340	5468580	beyond like david mamet you know writing how people talk as an audience is watching a stage
5468580	5472020	you're gonna have to just create you're gonna have to become an expert at creating awkward
5472020	5477300	moments i think because you're gonna want to like new stories will be like though though you know
5478100	5482340	i'm not saying we won't still enjoy watching people run from explosions and make dynamite out
5482340	5487140	of chewing gum or whatever but but fighting werewolves but but but the technology is going
5487140	5493780	to be really really really good at you know you walking into a party and and like you're just
5493780	5498020	noticing things and you're just a flop you know like this is kind of like what is your therapist
5498020	5504660	gonna say because i personally think as a gamer like people will be more drawn to doing things
5504660	5509620	in group like literally going we're also relaxing things i think my therapist because i really you're
5509620	5515060	banging on her a lot and i want you guys to get along i want you'd like her if you met her um
5516100	5521860	no she can watch a virtual sunset with her lesbian wife i think she's not she's not like
5521860	5526980	a ludite about it she's like if i was playing like pop the pop the pop the cherries or whatever

6196740	6202740	sending out some crickets you tried to search for your quarry your quarry was a big load a big
6202740	6210740	storage container full of mp3s mp3s that were locked by specific very high security musical

6357140	6362020	ice cream
6364820	6368820	nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens

6394020	6400500	the locks casing is made just of regular ass plastic and two on the back of the lock is engraved
6400500	6406100	to specific it's there's a very specific set of words almost like a sentence or a message

6450500	6454740	play it possibly yeah man you can jack it into your brain hole great
6460100	6465620	it was saturday night and you were standing by the window
6467460	6471780	i said i love that look the lock snaps open
6471780	6482020	i can't believe we took all those fucking lessons together
6484580	6492260	those fucking children as the roller door rolls open automatically you see stacks up note boxes
6492260	6502500	upon boxes full of mp3 dated chips it's a real mother load oh these are very valuable i believe
6504260	6512340	it's the best christmas dinner i ever had that's a clip from the from the diehard trilogy video game
6515540	6520340	on the first playstation was that the arcade game where you're like fighting yeah well there was a
6521300	6523780	it's three diehard games one was like crazy taxi
6525140	6529620	one of them you're just running around so like a top-down third person thing i loved that one
6529620	6534580	and when you found when you'd find health ups he'd go sometimes he'd say random things one of them
6534580	6542020	being the best christmas dinner i ever had and then when he got hit he'd sometimes he'd go
6542100	6544580	all things being considered i'd rather be in philadelphia
6550500	6556100	mp3 chips more than you can carry on your own we can carry all of these more than that
6557700	6564340	i still believe we can carry all of these uh well how okay well sorry i missed that part
6564340	6570340	we can't carry all of these i believe we can i start eating these mp3 chips so that they sit
6570340	6575140	in my stomach quickly dr fred please ascertain if they've made of egg in any way
6576660	6580980	they're not some sort of scam oh no you could just tell by looking at them these are the egg
6580980	6587460	free ones oh good is it possible to load them uh the data from them without using the physical
6587460	6591940	casing oh yeah you could definitely rip all of them but it takes some time oh yeah i'll be right
6591940	6597300	back i got an idea i'm gonna go to outside and didn't we come oh we came here in an uber right
6597700	6604580	shit i come back uh i had an idea but i kept picturing us as having a car
6606660	6610420	maybe you should get one well you know but we drink a lot and i think that
6611780	6615220	all things all things considered you know i think we're saving a lot that's not how
6615220	6623620	driving works in the future we they let you do it drunk yeah the computer does it for you guys we
6623700	6629460	gotta get a car maybe we can take all of these mp3 pairs and sell one and buy a car
6630020	6633460	i'm scared someone will hack our onboard computer in the car and kill us
6634420	6639540	all right okay all right hold on i know i'll be right back i'll be right back i'll be right back
6639540	6644980	i got it i got a second idea i run out i'm looking for a car just a stranger's car all right
6645540	6650820	because you know also it's just yeah you find a car it is a storage facility i would think that
6650820	6655860	there was a lift or a cart of some kind there's like a loading dock i mean there's carts you don't
6655860	6662180	know where they are though because you killed the guy i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna use my uh you
6662180	6668580	know knowledge as a former um law enforcement officer including my undercover training as a
6668580	6674100	criminal my backstory is very complicated and along the way i certainly learned how to hotwire a car
6675060	6681220	i have a cellular glove maker so i will make a glove uh that can lift everything and float it
6681220	6687700	away you couldn't make a glove that strong the glove maker it's for fingerprints and stuff
6687700	6696020	it's for spoofing fingerprints okay so this is not going to work how about you load the chips into me
6696020	6705460	that's a great solution to everything i'll be then i'll be your juke i'll be your jukebox
6705460	6709540	your storage facility your carrying facility your transporter but someone would have to pull
6709540	6714420	out weapons and guard the door and someone would have to feed at the same time i've noticed that i
6714420	6719380	can increase my body could i possibly get larger and carry more uh yeah definitely it'll okay it'll
6719380	6728740	help you somewhat you do that you get too larger all right i pick up twice as many chips as before
6728740	6734020	well that's not how the math works out you pick up thanks obama
6736420	6742020	45 more chips you're still woefully away all right you're still not nearly nearly
6742020	6746180	to cat gathering them all though it's going to take some time the car it gets hot wired
6747140	6748820	best christmas dinner i ever had
6756420	6760340	where are you going it's getting a handle
6765700	6773620	where am i you're outside the place i'm gonna drive through the through the doors and up to the
6774100	6778500	storage unit all right i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna flip a bitch is that still a phrase
6779540	6784980	yeah and then i'm gonna back in through the doors so i'm pulling up so it's like what from their
6784980	6789220	point of view i said i'll be right back after that first fuck up which was a little embarrassing
6789220	6792660	over time they'll forget it though because the second time i said now i got a different idea
6792660	6799700	and i left and then and i came through it's kind of cool yeah your car smashes through
6799700	6806900	the loading dock it arrives it pulls to a stop right outside the thing uh you guys call it a car
6806900	6814740	guy no we didn't but awesome he did when he's swab he's not french he's gonna be swab
6816980	6822900	open the trunk let's start shovel this shit and i would like to use my adrenaline boost
6823460	6829300	to help both in strength and in velocity as i move these faster and faster and faster
6829300	6833780	both your strength and your velocity are improved by your adrenaline boost as you load
6833780	6842660	mp3 chips into the trunk of a car uh soon all the chips are loaded in the car excellent i did
6842660	6848980	nothing it was great imagine being the guy that grew two sizes
6848980	6856820	yeah there's no decreased body on my list do i need to walk home or
6859220	6865780	hop on the roof dude you can disperse it if you want all right i want if you want yeah i do
