0	22200	Hello, everybody, thank you for waiting.

38960	48760	Oh, my God.
48760	57440	It's so nice to be back in our beautiful Los Angeles, California, at the glorious Egyptian
57440	61280	theater, Temple of the Pharaohs.
61280	62880	I've got very good news for you all.
62880	63880	Guess what?
63880	71600	Harman Town is now in session.
71600	74520	Somewhere amongst you, Rome is a new Pharaoh.
74520	81520	Won't you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
81520	91520	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,

98520	102520	And I nuzzled his nuts, I fucked him all the way across the country on a big bus, I'll
102520	108520	fuck your mama, I'll fuck your daddy too, I'll fuck your horse and I turned it to glue,

114520	120520	fuck your mama, I'll fuck your mama, I'll fuck your mama like a bitch, it was a llama
120520	126520	and she spit at me and I spit at her back, I turned her around and I came in her crack,
126520	130520	I'll fuck your mama on her head, fuck your mama in her face, fuck your mama to the moon
130520	136520	in outer space, fuck your mama in a freestyle rap so bad, fuck your mama all across this
136520	143520	great ass land, fuck your mama up to her and I came home, fuck your mama with a buffalo
143520	148520	row. Stole that rhyme for a different song.
149520	154520	Welcome back everybody, it's good to be back here in California.
163520	168520	It would have been nice to get some asses in these seats, but it's good that some of
168520	174520	you could have turned out, we have about 500 Angelenos in the audience, they all paid top
174520	179520	dollar, ten dollars at least, some people Jeff paid more than that, some people paid
179520	183520	for some VIP treatment. Yeah there was some kickstarter nonsense going on that I've never
183520	188520	quite understood how you do a kickstarter to make people come to a show. Not nonsense
188520	198520	Jeff, hormone sense. I mean there's 500 people here at least but Dan has already gone to
198520	202520	make a cocktail which is fantastic. Well because I had to leave mine back there because I'm
202520	206520	strapped with all this equipment, the director of the documentary has put me to work, there's
206520	213520	a GoPro camera on my head shooting everybody, that'll get some beautiful images of not you
213520	219520	waving just that light right there. There's a camera on your chest looking up at the camera
219520	224520	on your head. Yeah that's going to get a great shot to that camera. But normally you spend
224520	231520	so much time, Dan I mean. I mean I couldn't do this at home in the bathroom or anything.
231520	235520	You spend so much time looking at your feet anyway, there's going to be a camera shooting
235520	241520	camera, it's going to be like a Bruce Lee Hall of Mirrors going on. It's meta dude.
241520	244520	Do I want to make you a drink while you address the crowd? Yeah could you please Jesus Christ
244520	252520	man, fucking showman. We've got shit to do. We've got so much VIP treatment to knock out
252520	258520	but it's good to see so many old friends too. We've got to do a bullet train version of
258520	262520	Harmontown man. We've got some special guests here tonight and we've got a good friend that's
262520	268520	fresh out of radiation and I want to talk to him about his balls and we've got an old
268520	274520	hero that we've made closer friends with on the road out there and we have the Barbara
274520	279520	Walters of comedy who's going to give me some tips on interviewing and I think he's got
279520	286520	a pretty interesting story. But let's get these jingles out of the way. These are going to
286520	296520	be a cappella anyway, it doesn't matter. Yeah I don't know any of them. On the kickstarter
296520	302520	that we were selling tickets through, we offered for $250 you could get a jingle written about
302520	307520	your name. So the first person to take us up on it was our friend David Butler who's our
307520	315520	accountant. Who as far as we know paid for these tickets with our money. Right. So he
315520	327520	bought the option. So here's David Butler's jingle. Don't laugh. It's a comedy show. I'm
327520	337520	sorry, laugh. Not to my metronome. The butler did it. David Butler did it. The butler did
337520	343520	it in the butt. But when David Butler did it he regretted and he hit it so he did it
343520	350520	but we don't know what. And when Butler does it he gets away because it never leaves a single
350520	355520	clue. So when you meet a butler keep your eyes on all your butts or David Butler will be
355520	366520	doing you. Investigators on the scene can never find this butler's nuts and wiener deep in
366520	379520	your behind. And when there is no evidence there is no crime. So the butler does it but he does no
379520	389520	time. The butler did it. David Butler did it. He did it but we don't know what. He didn't use
389520	401520	a candlestick. His weapon is a giant dick. His victim is another butt. You can have your money
401520	408520	back. You know it's going to be good. This shot on this my shitty VHS camera. It looks like the
408520	413520	Lawrence Wilkes show out there. It looks really nice. Okay. These guys can really have their
413520	423520	money back. Jim Jim Jim what's his name? Spicoli? Scampoli. Is that you right there? Jim Scampoli
423520	428520	thank you for your two hundred fifty dollars. You can have it. You can have it back. Yes I know you
428520	433520	emailed and said I know the thing is for a name could you make it for the name of my comedy show
433520	440520	Jim and them. Hilarious for me to stand up here and sing your jingle for your show. But turn about
440520	449520	for a play. It's a shitty song. So I literally wrote it while like you know. And backstage had one
449520	454520	hand had a Chick-fil-A sandwich in it and the other hand was trying to write this song. Okay so
454520	461520	there's going to be a background track. Jim and them Jim and them Jim and them Jim and them Jim and
461520	471520	Jim and them are everywhere. And when they die no one will care. But they'll be buried side by side
471520	478520	with hands clasp tight and heads held high. They're just some friends of a guy named Jim. They don't
478520	488520	have much. But they've got him. Oh Christmas tree. Oh Jim and them. Let's drink some pee. With Jim and
488520	497520	them Jim and them Jim and them paid for this song. It was supposed to be a name so they did it wrong. But Jim and
497520	506520	them are where it's at. All dogs are boys all girls are cats. That's all I got. You can have your money
506520	524520	back. It's free Jim. Sports Corner. With your host Dan Harmon. He watched the Super Bowl and knows almost
524520	539520	everything about it. Sports Corner. So Dan. What a bowl. Yeah. What'd you think. No ordinary bowl. Jeff never is
539520	545520	this time of year. Now how do you feel about the city that hosted the that hosted the Super Bowl. How did they
545520	550520	do as a city. Well it's great when the team can be on their home turf. You know they always gain more confidence
550520	555520	from that. Yeah. So you thought the Saints had the home field advantage there. Great to see. Great to see them having the
555520	562520	home field advantage. Right. Yeah. Now you heard about the big the big gaff you know with the electric of the electricity
562520	568520	right. Yeah. Yeah. Well these things are going to happen. There's a lot of electricity pouring into the stadiums when
568520	574520	people play and so someone's going to always hit the wrong switch or something. Right. So who did you who did you have
574520	585520	your money on going into that game. I was a birds. What was the Ravens Ravens. You got one right. Well I I was I
585520	592520	learned this in San Francisco. Oh shit. I was I was I was thinking Ravens maybe. Yeah. And I thought maybe 49ers
592520	598520	and then Jeff it's all about yardage. So I just thought I would I thought I would wait to see which team got more yardage
598520	604520	and then base it on that. Did you know Jeff that they were playing on artificial turf. I didn't know that because it was an
604520	614520	indoor dome. Yeah. So the yardage is wider. Yeah. You gain more yardage sunlight sunlight shortens yards. Yeah. Yeah.
614520	620520	Yeah. So a great ball great game amazing the outcome. Who could have predicted it. Not me. Certainly nobody. We don't
620520	627520	need to repeat it. You don't need to quiz me on it. That's not what sports corners. Now it's time for an all tennis Australian
627520	641520	Open talk. Good day. All right. Wow. Some Australian open Harmon. Wow. Wimbledon's got nothing on the Australians Jeff.
641520	648520	Why is that. Well they've got larger. They've got courts that are larger. They've got they've got the nets are higher.
648520	655520	People are out there. They want to win. You know that they swing the rackets. Actually the the the umpire comes out the
655520	661520	beginning puts a larger net out and he holds the original size net and goes that's not a net. Yeah. Yeah. Then they bring out the
661520	669520	Australian net because now that's a net. Yeah. He lets you know sports corner sucks. Let's let's let's kill it. I knew too much
669520	674520	about the Super Bowl because I actually went to the bar. That's why that's why I went to Australian Open. You don't know shit
674520	679520	about tennis. I know. But then I said the courts are longer. I don't know what sports. I don't know what the joke is anymore.
679520	685520	I don't get it. I don't get my own joke anymore. You got too many cameras on your head sports. I don't know anything about sports.
685520	691520	I got a bunch of cameras in my head. Let's just let's let's freeform. If you could if you could be good at any sport. Honestly like if you
691520	696520	could be good at one physical activity or sport. What would you what would be the one thing you'd be awesome at. Does it come at the
696520	703520	expense of any anything. No. No. You poof and you have it. OK. Just an extra thing. Yeah. You can hit a baseball farther than anybody
704520	711520	or you're the world's best golfer or you can scuba dive deeper. I don't know. I almost want to say it. Billiards
712520	719520	but then I'd just be one of those billiard dicks. Because well that's where it would come in handy because you're like some people
719520	730520	call me billiards dick because I got a pocket for a ball. Some people call me billiards dick because I live inside a billiards
730520	741520	hall. Yeah. Oh I got chops. I live inside a place where they play pool and I fuck your mama all the time.
742520	749520	Rhyme squeeze a lime. What are you going to say there. Yeah. I don't care. You've been rapping across this great nation of ours
749520	758520	and you still haven't learned to stop saying south and mouth time and rhyme mama and llama. You know I don't know. I don't
758520	766520	know if any of you listened to the podcast as we went across the country. I felt there was an opportunity there for Dan to really grow
766520	773520	as a rapper and I think now is the time to test whether or not you have. I got good at rapping. You could hear me right around
773520	785520	Madison. You can hear me starting. Yo yo yo freestyle freestyle. Off the top of my head don't know what to say. Fucked your mama in the grass at the hay.
785520	797520	Took a picture court instead of my day. Stuck it inside her like a lunatic. She died. I went to prison. Newton invented the prism. Split light two three colors.
797520	809520	I fucked your mama and then her brother. That's my uncle. No it's yours. I fucked her. Their own pores. Fucked her left. Fucked her right. Fucked them with toothpaste. Made their teeth bright.
809520	819520	Fucked them. Fucked them on their tongue. Fucked them in their mouth. And then as done. As done. As done.
819520	835520	Okay I was wrong. Thanks Los Angeles. West Coast. You fucked a woman's brother and for a moment consider that it was your own uncle. Yeah well.
835520	843520	But you fuck as many mamas as I do. Chances are you're fucking one of your own uncles. Genealogy becomes a haze.
844520	851520	Like everyone's mama becomes like a silver Prius you know. It's like the most common thing just lost in the parking lot.
851520	858520	All right Harmon I missed you on the drive home. Holy shit. You all right. Yeah well it's just there's blood coming back to me. Jesus Christ.
858520	869520	In Denver you blame the altitude but this is we're not we're not high right now. Yeah I'm a little high.
869520	877520	All right. Jeff. But I left you for a while Dan and I had to fly off to Vegas to do a thing and I missed the ride home the triumphant return. Yeah. What did I miss.
877520	887520	I don't know what you missed. You missed the sacrifice. You know you missed did you see Splencers Splencers Splencers. I saw when he added an L to his name.
888520	898520	Yes Spencer left his incredibly beautiful melancholy YouTube be kind of clip and wait was he driving during that.
898520	904520	He kept talking about who's driving but he was looking at the camera. I was worried about drive out in Seamy Valley and just gets in his car and just drives.
904520	916520	And it was it was really it was beautiful and it's sadness. He's going to steal the documentary. We know the documentary character that everyone's gay for.
916520	924520	I like that guy. He's going to be on the cover of the DVD of his beard. He's bigger than you on our poster I think isn't he.
924520	934520	Probably. His beard's bare because I didn't learn anything Jeff. I didn't change out there. You learn nothing from that. A little better at rapping.
935520	942520	I didn't. I learned. I didn't learn. I learned that I'm an abusive boyfriend but I think I already knew that.
942520	954520	I learned. I learned that the fans are great. I learned they're good people. I learned that I can do whatever I want and that I don't know what to do with that permission to bore people make them sad.
954520	965520	Sometimes gross them out. I learned that I smell like an onion. I learned that I learned that I learned that my hemorrhoid comes back quicker if I'm off my diet.
965520	975520	Your hemorrhoid came back in Salt Lake City I believe. Dan was like like he was walking around backstage in Salt Lake City.
984520	1001520	Oh an old friend's coming back my hemorrhoid returned in Salt Lake. Sitting on the rim of my bum.
1001520	1013520	I tried to keep it a secret but it kept eking out and I couldn't help but tell everyone.
1013520	1031520	Cause when you got a hemorrhoid it itches and it bleeds and it doesn't matter what the audience needs. Just want to be truthful and tell her I got a fucking thing on my ass.
1032520	1047520	Howard has been head of the class. Saying again I'm saying Howard has been head of the class. I got a hemorrhoid sticking out of my ass.
1047520	1059520	Toby Keith gonna make some pita skins and grenades. I'm gonna do countries and invade. I'm gonna wave the flag and suck a million balls.
1059520	1071520	Toby Keith gonna ride a tank and get you some fries. Oh it's me Toby Keith surprise. I sang a song for you and I'm jerking it off in the mirror every night.
1071520	1089520	I fuck my mother and I cry when I masturbate. Toby Keith I'm a big dumb fucking asshole Toby Keith. Easy target. Easy target.
1089520	1099520	Yeah we came down pretty hard on Toby Keith. He barely survived the Dixie chick. He's an easy target. Almost lost a fight to a Dixie chick.
1099520	1109520	Okay let's start bringing some of our people up here. We got people. We got a roster of A-list people to talk to. I'm trying to think of what order to do them in.
1109520	1125520	I think that the most logical order will be to check in with. I'm sorry I'm out of breath. You were off your diet man. I went off my diet and I'm out of breath with my fake line dancing.
1126520	1140520	How much weight do you think you gained on the road? Probably like 15-20 pounds. There was a point where we went to In-N-Out and you weren't there. From San Francisco to LA I was like okay I gotta go back to the diet when I get to LA. That's when the shit really hit the fan.
1141520	1157520	That's when the shame eating started. Not hungry at all. Ever hungry. Just eating. Just to eat. Just because when we got to LA I was going to go back to the diet. Went to In-N-Out. Got a double double with some fries. A Neapolitan shake. It's a secret thing Spencer taught me about.
1158520	1184520	It's all kinds of stuff off the menu. You can get like a flying handjob. You can get a reverse chihuahua. You can get David Blaine's scrotum. That's cheese pickles and no onions but three patties. But they're not on a bun. They're on three sheets of paper and there's a cigarette on top.
1184520	1191520	And they're suspended 40 miles above the earth for six years. And then a bus drives by and it's got your dead friend's name on it.
1196520	1206520	It's only $4.95. It's a really a deal. It's pretty great but it never goes away. And it's slowly. It's just sadder and sadder.
1206520	1227520	So I got the double double. The fries were stale. They were too crispy. You follow me? I gotcha. I went to an adjacent McDonald's. Here's where it gets shady. Here's where it gets movie of the week.
1227520	1241520	The bus had overheated and everyone was watching our bus driver Jason fix the engine on the bus. I went to a McDonald's. These fries are stale. I'm going to get some better fries at McDonald's. I went to the McDonald's.
1242520	1250520	And they found one of your earlier french fries stuck in there just to buy you time. Just sabotage the engine to go to McDonald's.
1250520	1260520	I got fries but I'm not going to only get fries so I got a quarter pounder with cheese. And I got another milkshake in it.
1261520	1278520	And I put it all in the bag. I put the milkshake in a bag. I just looked like I had fries. And I just walked past everybody who was on a picnic watching the bus get fixed. And I was like top of the morning.
1278520	1286520	I'm going to finish off these fries and go take a nap. And I just went into a bus and hid while I ate.
1286520	1297520	Like a fucking 16 year old with real problems. But I'm 40. And the real problem is that shit will kill you man. What am I doing?
1297520	1318520	Our next guest is no stranger to diabetes. Our next guest we kept running into on the road out there. And he's an old hero of mine in terms of performance.
1318520	1331520	I don't want that on him because I don't have an act and I'm not doing anything that he would want attributed to him. But when we were in Milwaukee we saw him do something incredibly inspiring.
1331520	1349520	He put us past the tipping point of moving to LA. He was a master stand up at one point and then at another point completely reinvented as a guy that makes some great indie films.
1349520	1355520	So please welcome our friend, our road dog, our strange soulmate Bob Goldthwaite.
1355520	1376520	I think I'll just let you have this. Yeah. Okay. There you go. Hello. Check one. Hey, hi. Thank you. Hey, how are you? I'm good. I'm good. I'd love to take credit for your comedy styling.
1376520	1392520	Well, you kind of you sometimes you have a reputation like there's stories about you doing some insane shit on stage. Like what was the what was the story about where I please forgive me for not getting the details right. I'm going to sound like like like like your dad or whatever.
1392520	1405520	He lit Crispin Glover on fire one day. Correct. Yes. There was another thing was like you were open. Were you opening for for for Pearl Jam or what? No, I open up for Nirvana. Nirvana. Okay. Close enough.
1405520	1424520	First of all, hello, everybody. You know, I was sitting here waiting to go on and I started looking up and I was like, I like the theater. It's like, it was like this beautiful theater. And they said, no, we can put some new shit right over that beautiful old architecture. Take care of that. This is LA.
1425520	1434520	So I opened for Nirvana. Yeah, yeah, which people are always surprised that I met Nirvana before they broke.
1435520	1451520	Kurt was a fan of mine and he interviewed me on an Ann Arbor. Yeah, it was in a college radio station. He wanted to meet me. I don't know. It gets really weird and quiet. It's like finding out that that's fine here, though. That's just fascinating.
1452520	1472520	Did you say Kurt Cobain interviewed you on an Ann Arbor Michigan radio station? It was a college station. Yeah. Wow. And so he set up. So he was moonlighting as a college radio DJ during Nirvana. No, but it was funny because like he he wanted to meet me. So that's how it was put together. But it's funny because, you know, he was quiet and kind of mumbly. And then, you know, I'm going.
1473520	1498520	And so it was really an audible interview. But people, when they find that out, it's like finding out that like Jimi Hendrix really liked Buddy Hackett. You know, they really can't wrap their brains around it. But yeah, I did about 15 cities opening for Nirvana. But it was it was a lot of comics. I was like, oh, you know, worried about bombing. But like that, that never really bothered me.
1499520	1516520	You're setting you're being set up to bomb if you're a comic opening for a band. No one's there. Right. But I also kind of enjoyed that part of it. How did you do overall? Was it usually where they like that big? You can't even hear him laughing, right?
1517520	1533520	Well, it was about every third show ago. OK, the first show I did was in Chicago right after Michael Jordan had retired from basketball. And myself and the Nirvana's knew about as much about sports as you do.
1533520	1544520	Although I didn't even watch the football show yesterday and really watch it. But I saw the names of the teams and then someone someone brought shots over and then and then another guy that's in my cell phone came over.
1545520	1556520	And that's always bad news. And I woke up five p.m. the next day. I'm sorry to interrupt you, please. No, no, no. Look, if you're bored with me, I know how these stories end. No, no.
1557520	1575520	This is the story I want to hear. Oh, no. Oh, so it was it was in Chicago and it was like 4000 Nirvana fans and Michael Jordan had retired from basketball and I went out and I wouldn't do this now because I actually understand that everybody has feelings now.
1576520	1585520	But I went out and I said, hey, Chicago, how are you? I feel bad for Michael Jordan. But for 40 million dollars a year, I'd shoot my own dad in the fucking head.
1586520	1603520	And and there was this noise that wasn't even that grown. It was more like, like, like in my mind, when I retell the story, the pit stop moving, you know, but I actually got hit with a teenager once when I was doing the show.
1604520	1614520	When you do something like that, like you're not you're not sitting backstage or maybe there's like a there's like five minute period backstage. Do you see that shit flying off of my walrus beard for you in the podcast audience?
1615520	1625520	There's shit flying off of my beard and mustache and I haven't trimmed for 30 days. The so you're in the wings and you're kind of like maybe in your head, you're going like, I think I'll do maybe I'll do this.
1626520	1629520	But are you also thinking about their reaction or are you thinking?
1629520	1639520	If I know the truth, I never told this part of that story was I actually said that to Kurt as I was walking to the stage. I said 40 million dollars to shoot my own dad in the fucking head.
1640520	1645520	And then I went out there and I said it and he went afterwards because I can't believe you said that.
1646520	1651520	Did he like when you said it to him, did he go like you got to do that on stage?
1652520	1653520	No, no, no.
1654520	1655520	I'm working on. I don't know.
1656520	1657520	You got to do that.
1658520	1660520	That would be that would be a good goal.
1661520	1663520	If Kurt Cobain was a horny bear.
1664520	1665520	That's what that sounded like.
1666520	1667520	You got to do that on stage.
1668520	1670520	I want to rub bees on my dick.
1670520	1678520	So no. Yeah. So actually, I remember when I got off, he was truly like the only one laughing in the venue.
1679520	1680520	He was behind an amp.
1681520	1686520	But yeah, so have you ever gone to stage until the Kurt Cobain blowing his head off?
1687520	1688520	Myself?
1689520	1690520	Yeah. Oh, no.
1691520	1692520	I'm kidding. Of course.
1693520	1697520	Oh, you mean. Oh, well, that story comes full circle in a terrible way is what I'm saying.
1698520	1702520	Yeah. I feel like a bus you go by right now with his name on.
1704520	1706520	To really bum me out all the way, Jeff.
1707520	1709520	Hey, look at me from this angle. Look at me from this angle.
1712520	1714520	Just from that angle. Just that specific angle.
1715520	1719520	I think his most amazing power was that the amount of women he banged.
1720520	1722520	That's the real David Blaine magic.
1722520	1727520	So so you're out. Why are you out there on the road? Why did I run into you in my underwear?
1728520	1729520	My girlfriend in a hotel.
1730520	1731520	I was a nice icebreaker.
1732520	1733520	I don't know why.
1734520	1735520	Well, you guys were fighting.
1736520	1737520	Could you hear us? Oh, yeah.
1738520	1740520	Yeah. I think you said you couldn't that night.
1741520	1743520	I heard you when I walked in. I when I came down the hall, I heard you fighting.
1744520	1747520	Oh, fuck me. I mean, that was the documentary.
1747520	1751520	But it didn't sound like I gauged it. I was like, is this 911?
1752520	1755520	No, this is just they're just rehashing shit. Yeah.
1756520	1759520	Because the people next to us was more. They were more of a dick in the ass.
1760520	1762520	That woman that came out and yelled at autistic kids or something.
1763520	1765520	It sounded like she was skinning an autistic kid.
1766520	1771520	It was just like, I just put my babies to bed.
1772520	1773520	I go, whatever you're calling it, lady.
1774520	1777520	Members, she she got she yelled at us for being in the hall.
1778520	1780520	Yeah, yeah, she did. That was that outrageous thing.
1781520	1782520	I was yelling at my girlfriend.
1783520	1785520	I was doing my Kevin Spacey. I call it my Kevin Spacey.
1786520	1790520	I like the fact that you, a family and 80s comedian, Bobcat Goldway,
1791520	1792520	and I'm the only one not screaming.
1796520	1797520	Why am I the quiet one here?
1798520	1801520	Yeah. Why am I the one? Hey, man, we can all just, you know, keep it cool.
1801520	1804520	All right. If my career has taught you anything, it's shh.
1809520	1810520	I never put that together.
1811520	1813520	You used to be famous for screaming.
1817520	1820520	That's a testament to how cool you've become in your recent career.
1821520	1822520	That's another thing I wanted to ask you about.
1823520	1827520	Your films, I feel like there must be something you do as a director.
1828520	1830520	This is going to sound like I'm just kissing your ass because you're here.
1831520	1834520	I always wanted to ask you if there's something you do with your actors
1835520	1838520	because I don't want to bag on Robin Williams.
1839520	1841520	He's a comedic icon, national treasure, blah, blah, blah.
1842520	1845520	I don't think he'd cry if he heard another person say,
1846520	1849520	yeah, he's never really on my cup of tea on screen as a dramatic actor.
1850520	1852520	But then your movie, where in that first actor,
1853520	1857520	he's relating to that kid who eventually, auto-eradically asphyxiates himself.
1858520	1859520	Spoiler alert.
1860520	1861520	Well, that's the first plot.
1862520	1864520	Look, if you haven't seen it, who cares? The kid dies jerking off.
1865520	1866520	Father of the Year.
1867520	1868520	World's Greatest Dad.
1869520	1870520	World's Greatest Goddamn Dad. This is the third time I've done that.
1871520	1872520	But what is Father of the Year? Is that a...
1873520	1874520	That must be some movie with...
1875520	1876520	It's like Billy Crystal or something.
1877520	1878520	That's Father's Day.
1879520	1880520	Father's Day? I don't fucking know.
1881520	1882520	Well, let's make a movie called Father of the Year,
1883520	1885520	and I stop being wrong about it when I ask you about it.
1886520	1887520	Sequel? It'll have to be a flashback.
1887520	1889520	Oh, remember before my kid died?
1890520	1894520	It'd be like the Muppet Babies of erotic, auto-erotic fiction.
1895520	1901520	I found Robin Williams, like, absolutely resonant and relatable and compelling in that movie.
1902520	1905520	Not only is it the first time I liked him in a long time as a dramatic actor,
1906520	1911520	but it is the first time that I've ever seen a story about a dad of a teenage kid.
1912520	1915520	I'm 40 years old now. I should have had a kid a long time ago.
1915520	1916520	I'll probably have one at some point.
1917520	1918520	You listening?
1919520	1921520	Not if you keep yelling at her.
1922520	1925520	No, are you kidding me? That makes her eggs drop.
1926520	1927520	Yeah, I'm sure that is. I'm sure that is.
1928520	1929520	We're like cats. It's like the barbed penis.
1930520	1933520	Again, I wasn't nervous for either of your safety when I heard the fighting scene.
1934520	1935520	It's just a white trash mating dance. That's all you're hearing.
1936520	1939520	It was like so played out, your argument. At one point, I heard you go, line...
1939520	1945520	Just you're off book and you're confusing me.
1946520	1949520	I did you a favor the day I met you.
1950520	1952520	I did you a favor the day I met you.
1953520	1954520	Now you want more?
1960520	1964520	I will strangle you with this plastic thing that holds six packs together.
1965520	1966520	You're a fish to me.
1966520	1976520	If you were in a movie with me right now, I'd say, Dan, that was really good.
1977520	1980520	Let's just do it again. We have mics.
1981520	1983520	Everybody can hear you.
1984520	1986520	That is often the note I get from...
1987520	1991520	Well, from me. I always thought I had to make the craft service people laugh.
1992520	1995520	I do still say that I'm a really bad actor.
1996520	1999520	I think maybe part of that, if people do like the movies I make...
2000520	2003520	You can ask Maren. I just worked with him. I don't know if I did anything for him.
2004520	2006520	I'm not going to ask Maren anything. He's going to go...
2012520	2013520	Robin and I have been friends.
2014520	2015520	Mark Maren, everybody.
2016520	2017520	Mark Maren to the stage.
2018520	2019520	Just come on up.
2020520	2021520	Mark Maren.
2022520	2023520	Mark Maren.
2025520	2026520	It's Mark Maren.
2027520	2030520	Mark Maren, why you staring? Is your mama rocking Sharon?
2031520	2033520	Going to fuck her like Sharon Stone.
2034520	2036520	I give your mama my bone to Mark Maren.
2037520	2041520	Mrs. Maren got alone, but not for long when I came to her house.
2042520	2045520	I put my whittle weeny in her like a shit was a mouth suit.
2045520	2048520	When a creepy creepy cook, I get some cheese.
2049520	2052520	My name is Martha Maren. Could I have some more, please?
2053520	2055520	Harmon's dick is going to make you pregnant.
2056520	2058520	Nothing's going to rhyme with that. That's the end.
2060520	2061520	Hello, Mark.
2062520	2063520	Hey.
2063520	2064520	Is this Vine? Are you vining me?
2065520	2067520	I got to tell my mom to listen to this.
2069520	2070520	I didn't know what Vine was.
2071520	2073520	Those ones are going to tell my mother to listen to. That's very nice.
2074520	2079520	I thought vining was actually putting your penis in the foreground of a photo.
2082520	2085520	So there's a lot of motherfucking going on in your raps.
2086520	2089520	I am not soft on mamas when I rap.
2090520	2095520	I don't get to use the n-word, so I just fill. My styrofoam peanut is fucked your mama.
2096520	2098520	So that's your analogy for the n-word, is your mother?
2099520	2102520	No, I'm just saying, if I could use the n-word, my raps would be filled with it.
2103520	2107520	They're like, there's a gentleman, bam, right, boiled it down.
2108520	2111520	So your mother's the n-word.
2112520	2114520	He's the Barbara Walters of comics.
2114520	2116520	I'm not sure I like that so much.
2118520	2122520	I saw that written about you, and I thought that you immediately knew that you would not like that.
2123520	2124520	That was amazing.
2124520	2126520	I'm an annoying Jewish woman of podcasting.
2128520	2129520	All right, I'll take it. I'll take it.
2130520	2133520	I've always saw him as the Dallas Reigns of...
2135520	2137520	I'm glad I'm not the only person who didn't get that reference.
2138520	2140520	Famous orange weatherman from California.
2141520	2142520	Okay, okay.
2143520	2145520	Good job on getting the mic. That only took a few minutes.
2148520	2152520	I leaned over and I went like, I gave a couple of hands.
2152520	2154520	No, it feels better now. I appreciate it.
2155520	2157520	You want to know about Bob's directing style?
2157520	2158520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2158520	2160520	He directed four episodes of my show.
2161520	2164520	Which I saw the pilot for, which I'm really looking forward to.
2164520	2165520	Yeah, we talked about it. It was great.
2165520	2170520	What Bob will do is he'll let you run the scene and everybody will do the lines and everything.
2171520	2175520	And then what he would do with me is he'd come over and he'd sort of pull me aside and he goes,
2175520	2177520	don't listen to what anyone else is saying.
2178520	2182520	Okay, just do what you want to do and I'm going to be over there.
2182520	2186520	Do you hear a car start?
2186520	2187520	Is that right?
2187520	2188520	That's fair, yeah.
2189520	2193520	I spend most of my time when I'm directing trying to find a chair.
2194520	2195520	Yeah.
2195520	2198520	Talk to me by the great Richard Donner, actually.
2198520	2201520	I was in Scrooge that he directed and A Tale from the Crypt.
2201520	2203520	He's like, kid, you want to learn how to direct?
2203520	2206520	I go, yeah. And he goes, come in my trailer.
2206520	2207520	Uh-oh.
2207520	2209520	Yeah, I'm not falling for that again. No.
2213520	2217520	And so he says, he just throws me a pillow and he goes, take a lot of naps.
2218520	2220520	It's a true story. I go, really?
2221520	2223520	And that's why he got fired off as Superman, too.
2223520	2224520	Yeah.
2224520	2226520	That's what I was told writers, like young writers.
2226520	2229520	You have any advice for young writers? I'm like, go take a nap.
2229520	2233520	You're young. Don't wake up until the pressure's on.
2233520	2237520	You sit at the computer and you look at the screen until you go, fuck.
2237520	2239520	And then you jerk off.
2240520	2241520	And then you take a nap.
2242520	2245520	Isn't that writing? I mean, am I misunderstanding it?
2245520	2250520	Get as short a deadline as you possibly can from anyone that's willing to pay you for anything,
2250520	2255520	because if they give you nine months, you will find out what happens to your body
2255520	2258520	if you masturbate for eight months and three weeks.
2259520	2262520	You will see a penis score.
2262520	2265520	I passed that line 20 years ago.
2267520	2271520	All this is explained to you in the WGA Guild books.
2273520	2276520	Just a bunch of photos of writer's dicks.
2277520	2280520	A bunch of photos of writer's dicks.
2280520	2282520	Do you want me to...
2282520	2285520	A mac and cheese on the stove. I'm sorry.
2285520	2290520	No, I don't want to step on anything, but I talked to you before the show,
2290520	2296520	and I've got this story that is such a classic show-vision story that I've been gifted with.
2296520	2299520	I never expected this to happen in my life.
2299520	2303520	And I've got a classic show-business story.
2303520	2308520	I think this is the place to do it if anyone here wants to hear a classic.
2308520	2314520	Because it also addresses your question about interviewing, because it all comes around to this.
2314520	2320520	By the way, this is what I want. I brought Marc Maron here because I wanted to trick people into buying tickets,
2320520	2324520	but also I wanted to ask him because I just finished his podcast tour.
2324520	2328520	I'm a terrible interviewer. This is my weakest skill, right, Jeff?
2328520	2330520	After rap.
2330520	2332520	I think he's excellent at rap.
2332520	2334520	He is. He's all right.
2334520	2340520	Interviewing was no easy task, going to fuck your mama so hard, pushing into flasks.
2340520	2343520	What I do. What I do.
2343520	2349520	The thing was going to be, I was going to ask Maron, how do you interview people?
2349520	2351520	That's the Barbara Walters of comedians.
2351520	2354520	I don't know about that, but here's what happens.
2354520	2359520	I get an opportunity to interview Mel Brooks.
2359520	2362520	It went up today, and if you listened to it, you heard half of this story.
2362520	2364520	You haven't heard the whole story.
2364520	2369520	Mel Brooks, there's nothing he hasn't said publicly about his life that he has worked into a shtick
2369520	2371520	and that he's gotten laughs with. It's all out there.
2371520	2374520	I did research. I watched all the old Dick Cavett shows.
2374520	2376520	I watched the new Dick Cavett interview.
2376520	2379520	I watched him interviewed by some English guy.
2379520	2381520	I listened to a whole episode of The Nerdist.
2381520	2385520	That's how far I went. Wow.
2385520	2390520	I say that with love and a slight bit of resentment and contempt.
2390520	2394520	That's the triangle for me. That's the triad.
2394520	2399520	My problem was, how am I going to talk to Mel Brooks and get something out of him
2399520	2403520	that he hasn't said before and really connect with him as a person?
2403520	2407520	I realized going in, this would be the advice. I don't know if you can take this advice.
2407520	2410520	My first thought was, like, I'm a Jew.
2410520	2415520	Sorry. I'm a Jew. He's a Jew.
2415520	2418520	Yeah, we used to...
2418520	2420520	This place is beautiful.
2420520	2422520	No, we did a lot of work for them.
2422520	2424520	We did a lot of work for them.
2424520	2426520	Some of the greatest Jewish artifacts are Egyptian.
2426520	2428520	We're going to put you in a basket in a river after the show.
2428520	2432520	That would be fine. I hope that his mother finds me.
2432520	2434520	So I can fuck her.
2434520	2436520	Boom.
2436520	2438520	Westside.
2438520	2441520	I'll just go full Jew with Mel.
2441520	2446520	Literally. I got in there and within five minutes I'm talking like this.
2446520	2448520	What, are you kidding me? Of course.
2448520	2450520	New podcast, full Jew with Mel.
2450520	2451520	Full Jew with Mel.
2451520	2455520	But I've seen that happen to you when we had kindler on the show.
2455520	2460520	You've got payas doing like that.
2460520	2462520	It's really weird.
2463520	2466520	That was a good moment on the show. That was fucking hilarious.
2466520	2470520	Judd Hirsch plays my dad, and my dad's a bipolar lunatic, all right?
2470520	2473520	So they get Judd Hirsch to play him, and my concern was Judd Hirsch is a little too,
2473520	2475520	hey, how are you? I'm cute.
2475520	2477520	You replaced what's-his-name with Judd Hirsch?
2477520	2478520	He couldn't do it.
2478520	2480520	That's awesome. Judd Hirsch isn't that great.
2480520	2481520	He's a great actor, right?
2481520	2486520	But my fear was he'd be too cute and too Jewey and not scary enough to be my father, right?
2486520	2489520	So he gets there on the first day of shooting, and he's doing his Judd Hirsch thing, like,
2489520	2491520	hey, I'm here. What are we doing?
2491520	2496520	And all you guys were sitting there behind the camera going, oh, he's doing it.
2496520	2497520	Uh-oh.
2497520	2498520	Oh, boy, it's Independence Day.
2498520	2501520	Right, and then there was that moment where I'm like, he's an actor.
2501520	2502520	Go tell him to be scary.
2502520	2504520	And then you went over there, and I think you said,
2504520	2508520	Judd, can you turn down the Jew a little bit?
2508520	2510520	Is that what you said?
2510520	2511520	Yes.
2511520	2516520	Could you just leaven it one quarter inch?
2516520	2520520	Could you just snip a little bit off the end of it?
2520520	2522520	Or snip less, right? I don't know.
2522520	2524520	That always confuses me.
2524520	2526520	No, because I always...
2526520	2528520	What do I say about this?
2528520	2530520	He was great, by the way.
2530520	2536520	Oh, you know, my favorite part of that was we got done with that episode, and you go, Mary goes,
2536520	2541520	I think my real dad's going to sue me.
2541520	2544520	And I go, he should.
2544520	2545520	That may happen.
2545520	2549520	No, Brooks, I don't want to take up all your time. I got to tell this story.
2549520	2550520	Full Jew.
2550520	2551520	So I talked to Mel Brooks.
2551520	2553520	I'm talking to him. We're getting along. We're hitting it off.
2553520	2555520	There's a couple of great moments in the podcast.
2555520	2557520	One that is not actually on the podcast.
2557520	2561520	Mel Brooks looks at me and goes, I'm going to give you something exclusive.
2561520	2563520	And I'm like, fucking great.
2563520	2565520	He goes, I'm at the Fox Commissary.
2565520	2567520	I see Gene Wilder sitting with a legal pad.
2567520	2569520	And I walk up to him and go, what are you writing, Gene?
2569520	2571520	He goes, Young Frankenstein. It's an outline for a movie.
2571520	2575520	And Mel Brooks says, he says, I said to Gene, I said, we're going to do that movie.
2575520	2577520	And Gene said, you got to get me out here.
2577520	2579520	And Mel Brooks said, I'll get you out here.
2579520	2582520	And Gene says, I want a cottage at that.
2582520	2586520	And then Mel Brooks goes, what the hell is that hotel?
2586520	2587520	What's that hotel?
2587520	2589520	And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about.
2589520	2593520	You know it's a hotel. It's in Bel Air. It's a hotel.
2593520	2594520	And I go, Beverly Hills Hotel.
2594520	2601520	He goes, no, it's in Bel Air. Hold on a minute. I'll get it.
2601520	2604520	And then he stands up and he goes to the door where his assistant is.
2604520	2606520	He goes, what is that hotel?
2606520	2608520	It's in Bel Air. It's on that street.
2608520	2609520	What is it called?
2609520	2611520	And I hear the assistant go, I don't know.
2611520	2613520	He's like, look it up on the thing.
2613520	2616520	All right. So I hear her clicking away.
2616520	2619520	And he goes, it's in Bel Air.
2619520	2621520	And she goes, is it the Bel Air Hotel? That's it.
2621520	2622520	The Bel Air Hotel.
2622520	2624520	Wow.
2624520	2626520	And he comes in and he sits down.
2626520	2628520	He wants a room at the Bel Air Hotel.
2628520	2633520	He wants a supply of Earl Grey Tea and a supply of digestive biscuits.
2633520	2636520	And then I'm like, yeah. And he goes, that's the whole thing.
2636520	2638520	All right.
2638520	2639520	Excuse me.
2639520	2641520	He says he got that out of Mel Brooks.
2641520	2642520	Yeah, that's amazing.
2642520	2643520	He's a master.
2643520	2646520	All right. So here's what happens.
2646520	2648520	Here's what happens.
2648520	2651520	So I do this whole interview and Mel takes a liking to me and he says,
2651520	2653520	you know, you should be doing a talk show on television.
2653520	2657520	And I'm like, great. Make some calls. Let's make it happen.
2657520	2658520	I want a cottage.
2658520	2660520	Right. Yeah. At that hotel.
2660520	2661520	It's in Bel Air.
2661520	2664520	I need red zinger.
2664520	2665520	What's that?
2665520	2666520	It's behind the bar.
2666520	2667520	It's at the Marmont.
2667520	2668520	It's a bungalow.
2668520	2669520	What's it called?
2669520	2672520	Yeah. So he then goes, you got to talk to Carl.
2672520	2673520	You got to talk to Carl Reiner.
2673520	2674520	And I'm like, that'd be great.
2674520	2676520	He goes, I'll set up for you.
2676520	2677520	I'll call Carl Reiner.
2677520	2678520	It'll be great.
2678520	2679520	And I go, how is Carl Reiner?
2679520	2682520	And Mel goes, he's about 80 percent.
2682520	2684520	All right.
2684520	2685520	Hold on. Hold on.
2685520	2686520	This is great.
2686520	2687520	That's awesome.
2687520	2690520	So then so then Mel goes, you know what?
2690520	2691520	I'm going to walk you out.
2691520	2692520	And I'm at Culver.
2692520	2695520	I'm on the second floor in an office building in Culver Studios.
2695520	2696520	So I walk outside.
2696520	2697520	We walk down the hall.
2697520	2698520	I go, thank you, Mel.
2698520	2700520	And I got my boom in my bag and everything goes, you know what?
2700520	2701520	I'll walk you down.
2701520	2703520	So then we walk down and I go, all right.
2703520	2704520	Well, it's great, Mr. Books.
2704520	2706520	He goes, I'm going to walk you outside.
2706520	2708520	So we walk outside and we're standing outside.
2708520	2709520	I go, well, thank you again.
2709520	2711520	He goes, where's your car?
2711520	2712520	And I go, it's in the parking.
2712520	2715520	I say, I'll walk you to your car.
2715520	2716520	So I'm walking with Mel.
2716520	2717520	It's kid-feared.
2717520	2719520	Right. I'm walking with exactly.
2719520	2720520	Ladies and gentlemen, Mel Brooks.
2720520	2721520	Except it's hilarious.
2721520	2724520	You would love him to be here.
2724520	2727520	So then we walk to the parking and he goes, which car is it?
2727520	2728520	And I go, it's a camera.
2728520	2730520	He goes, and he points it to Bentley.
2730520	2731520	He goes, oh, I thought this was it.
2731520	2734520	Why did I walk you out here?
2734520	2736520	And he goes, he goes, which camera?
2736520	2737520	I go, it's that one.
2737520	2738520	And I walk over to the car.
2738520	2740520	I'm like, thank you, Mel Brooks and Mr. Brooks.
2740520	2746520	And he goes, no, I'm going to watch you put your stuff in your car.
2746520	2748520	So I put the stuff in the car.
2748520	2749520	And he goes, you should have a talk show.
2749520	2750520	And I'm like, make those calls.
2750520	2751520	He goes, you talk to Carl.
2751520	2754520	Right. All right.
2754520	2755520	So he sets up Carl.
2755520	2756520	So I go to Carl's house.
2756520	2757520	There's a whole other series.
2757520	2760520	There's a whole other Jewish experience.
2760520	2761520	I go to Carl's house.
2761520	2764520	I'm greeted by his nephew and manager, George Shapiro,
2764520	2765520	who's in his 70s.
2765520	2766520	All right.
2766520	2769520	Carl is going to be 91.
2769520	2771520	So George, yeah, right.
2771520	2772520	George Shapiro comes.
2772520	2773520	He greets me.
2773520	2774520	He talks about Seinfeld for five minutes.
2774520	2775520	There's a publicist there.
2775520	2777520	There's a chair, a couch.
2777520	2778520	And then Carl comes down.
2778520	2779520	And he sits in a chair.
2779520	2781520	And I mic him up with the boom, right.
2781520	2783520	And we start talking, right.
2783520	2785520	And I say, so you and Mel hang out every night.
2785520	2787520	I heard he comes over here every night.
2787520	2788520	We hang out.
2788520	2789520	I'm like, what do you do?
2789520	2791520	He goes, it has to do with chicken feathers.
2791520	2792520	Maybe I'll tell you.
2792520	2794520	Fine.
2794520	2797520	So I'm sitting there talking to Carl for like an hour.
2797520	2801520	While I'm talking to Carl, George Shapiro is in a chair directly across from us
2801520	2806520	the entire time he's in and out of this.
2806520	2809520	But when I finish the interview, Shapiro is the first one to get up and go, God,
2809520	2810520	that was great.
2810520	2812520	That was a great interview.
2812520	2813520	All right.
2813520	2814520	A couple of things happen real quick.
2814520	2817520	I'm getting to the punch line.
2817520	2818520	You're doing fine.
2818520	2821520	In the middle of the interview, he says, did you see that show on PBS about the
2821520	2825520	Jews and the Broadway musicals, how many Jews were involved in Broadway musicals?
2825520	2826520	I go, I didn't see it.
2826520	2830520	He goes, I never knew there were so many Jews involved in Broadway musicals.
2830520	2831520	There's a whole list at the end.
2831520	2832520	You got to see it.
2832520	2834520	I'll show it to you after the interview.
2834520	2837520	I'm like, fine.
2837520	2839520	So we finish this fucking interview.
2839520	2841520	I talked to him for like an hour and 15 minutes.
2841520	2843520	And then he starts, he says, I'm going to show you the thing.
2843520	2846520	He starts playing with remote controls to find the thing on the Tivo, right?
2846520	2848520	George Shapiro goes, is there ice cream?
2848520	2851520	All right.
2851520	2855520	Shapiro goes and he gets a box of ice cream sandwiches and he hands everyone an
2855520	2856520	ice cream sandwich.
2856520	2860520	So now, now we're eating ice cream sandwiches.
2860520	2862520	Carl is figuring out the Tivo.
2862520	2864520	I want to be Jewish.
2864520	2867520	I want to be 90.
2867520	2873520	So he finally figures the Tivo out and he starts the documentary at the beginning.
2873520	2876520	So I'm sitting there with an ice cream sandwich, thinking, am I going to have to
2876520	2878520	sit here for a fucking hour and watch the whole thing?
2878520	2881520	I mean, it's familiar to me, but it's also a little peculiar, right?
2881520	2886520	So we're watching that and I'm just sitting there and we're eating the ice cream.
2886520	2889520	And yeah, I'm like, yeah, George Gershwin and we're talking.
2889520	2893520	The phone rings and I see Carl pick it up and I'm putting my shit away and he
2893520	2894520	goes, hello?
2894520	2895520	Yes, it was great.
2895520	2896520	It went very well.
2896520	2897520	Yes.
2897520	2903520	And he holds the phone out and he looks at me and he goes, it's Mel.
2903520	2904520	So I pick up the phone.
2904520	2905520	I go, hello?
2905520	2913520	And all I hear is 80 percent, right?
2913520	2914520	The butler did it.
2914520	2915520	David Butler did it.
2915520	2916520	He did it.
2917520	2921520	And then I said to Carl, you know, I said, I said to Mel, I said, maybe 85.
2921520	2925520	And he goes, all right, maybe 85.
2925520	2928520	Put Carl back on the microphone.
2928520	2929520	So then on the microphone.
2929520	2930520	Yeah.
2930520	2932520	And then then Carl hangs up the phone.
2932520	2934520	They talk about chicken for a few minutes.
2934520	2935520	They can't hear.
2935520	2936520	So they have a microphone.
2936520	2938520	I think he was just being cute.
2938520	2940520	So then I forget that, Mike.
2940520	2941520	I forget to ask him about the feathers.
2941520	2942520	Like, what's the chicken feathers?
2942520	2944520	Well, you and Mel, what is that about?
2944520	2945520	He goes, all right.
2945520	2946520	I go, no.
2946520	2947520	I go, yeah.
2947520	2949520	And he points to the publicist who's on the couch.
2949520	2951520	He goes, you got a pillow behind you?
2951520	2952520	Can you feel anything?
2952520	2954520	Just give me the pillow.
2954520	2956520	So this guy hands Carl the pillow.
2956520	2959520	And Carl sitting down, he puts the pillow on his lap.
2959520	2964520	And very delicately starts running his hand over this pillow like this.
2964520	2965520	And then he goes, ooh.
2965520	2968520	And he pulls a feather out of the pillow, right?
2968520	2970520	And like a down feather, you know.
2970520	2973520	And he very delicately puts it on the armrest.
2973520	2975520	And he says, I put these in a bag.
2975520	2978520	I've got a lot of them.
2978520	2979520	Yeah.
2979520	2983520	And he goes, I don't know what I'm going to do with them, but I got a lot of them.
2983520	2985520	And then he starts running his hand over the pillow again.
2985520	2989520	I go, what's this have to do with you sitting here for hours with Mel Brooks?
2989520	2993520	He goes, this is what we do.
2993520	2996520	Mark Marin, everybody.
2996520	2999520	That was a new cement called the full Jew.
2999520	3000520	Yeah.
3000520	3001520	The full Jew.
3001520	3002520	Hilarious.
3002520	3003520	A new segment.
3003520	3006520	We're going to bring Marin back every week and do the full Jew.
3006520	3008520	If he can stay in with these guys.
3008520	3009520	Are you kidding?
3009520	3013520	I could do that any night of the week.
3013520	3017520	So I think we got a sneak hint of it.
3017520	3023520	But I did want to ask, is there anything specific that you said, Bob, to Robin Williams on that
3023520	3029520	set that resulted in me going, holy shit, that guy's me instead of the guy from Hook,
3030520	3032520	instead of the guy from Mrs. Doubtfire?
3032520	3033520	Yeah.
3033520	3038520	I pull him aside and I said, don't be so Jewy.
3038520	3040520	That's what I say to every actor.
3040520	3041520	Okay.
3041520	3042520	Okay.
3042520	3043520	Okay, Bobby.
3043520	3044520	Okay.
3044520	3045520	Okay.
3045520	3046520	Okay.
3046520	3047520	Okay.
3047520	3048520	Okay.
3048520	3049520	Okay.
3049520	3050520	Okay.
3050520	3051520	Okay.
3051520	3052520	Very good.
3052520	3053520	Very good.
3053520	3054520	Yeah.
3054520	3055520	Stop.
3055520	3056520	I go in to talk.
3056520	3057520	Don't be afraid.
3057520	3058520	Don't be afraid.
3058520	3059520	It's so not even close.
3059520	3060520	Stand up like this now.
3060520	3061520	Like this.
3061520	3062520	Nope.
3062520	3063520	Yeah.
3063520	3064520	Both of you can fucking cram it.
3064520	3065520	Here's how it goes.
3065520	3066520	Uh-oh.
3066520	3069520	Dueling, dueling Williamses.
3069520	3072520	That was wonderful.
3072520	3075520	Drop the mic.
3075520	3077520	Drop the mic.
3077520	3078520	Drop it.
3078520	3080520	Bobcat Goldsway, everybody.
3080520	3081520	Yeah.
3081520	3082520	Yeah.
3082520	3085520	That seems like a good exit for both of you.
3085520	3088520	Bobcat Goldsway and Mark Marin.
3088520	3089520	Yeah.
3089520	3091520	Came to Harmon Town.
3091520	3092520	Thank you.
3092520	3094520	I'm sorry I smell like an onion.
3094520	3096520	No, you do too.
3096520	3098520	So awesome.
3098520	3101520	That was wonderful.
3101520	3103520	That was beautiful.
3103520	3104520	I don't know.
3104520	3105520	Mr. Happy.
3105520	3108520	This isn't a cup.
3108520	3111520	It's a hat.
3111520	3112520	Don't be afraid.
3112520	3113520	Don't be afraid.
3114520	3116520	Oh, so many people out there.
3116520	3121520	Oh, so I feel like my dick could fuck everyone.
3121520	3123520	Let's say I can't do it.
3123520	3124520	He's magic.
3126520	3128520	Can we get Spencer Crittenden into the stage, please?
3128520	3129520	Spencer.
3133520	3137520	Dungeon Master to the stars.
3137520	3140520	Storyteller extraordinaire.
3141520	3146520	He approaches the stage, clad in red flannel.
3146520	3150520	His beard is both inviting and repellent.
3150520	3156520	He is the master of all worlds, inhabitant of none.
3156520	3162520	Spencer Crittendenzen, friend.
3162520	3166520	His name was improvised by Chevy Chase.
3166520	3169520	Spencer Crittendenzen.
3169520	3171520	Hey Spencer, welcome back to Los Angeles, man.
3171520	3176520	By the way, what a fucking asshole move that was.
3176520	3180520	Rewind, edit that out, say that again, and go.
3180520	3182520	Spencer, welcome back to Los Angeles.
3182520	3185520	You know what I love about cookies?
3185520	3189520	A booyah, booyah, everybody, booyah.
3189520	3193520	A booyah, booyah rap, special booyah rap.
3193520	3195520	Got a booyah rap about the word booyah.
3195520	3198520	Now I'm gonna tell you about how to cool ya booyah.
3199520	3201520	Do it again, do it again, do it again, for real.
3201520	3202520	I won't do it again.
3202520	3205520	Spencer, it's great to see you back in Los Angeles, man.
3205520	3208520	It's good to be back in Los Angeles.
3208520	3210520	What can I say?
3210520	3211520	Yeah.
3211520	3215520	Although, you're from, what, Moorpark, Simi Valley?
3215520	3218520	Yeah, Moorpark. Adjacent to Simi Valley.
3218520	3221520	So you don't really call Los Angeles or Hollywood home.
3221520	3224520	You're a visitor here, more or less, aren't you?
3224520	3226520	When I'm explaining it to people who don't live in Los Angeles,
3226520	3229520	I say I live outside of Los Angeles.
3229520	3232520	That's about it. That's not even a joke.
3234520	3236520	That's my life.
3238520	3240520	That's no joke, that's my life.
3240520	3241520	Yeah, man.
3241520	3244520	It's really staying Jewish up here.
3245520	3247520	It's fine. That's good.
3247520	3250520	They're good people. They're unchosen people.
3250520	3253520	Harmon said that he's learned nothing from this tour that we did.
3253520	3254520	Did you learn anything?
3254520	3259520	I learned that I'm apparently pretty great.
3262520	3263520	People like you.
3263520	3264520	I agree.
3264520	3266520	They like you just the way you are.
3266520	3269520	I kept telling them not to, but it didn't stop them.
3269520	3271520	You are a contrarian by nature.
3271520	3281520	You explained to me, you constantly try to offset the weight of whatever the universe is dealing with.
3281520	3282520	I'm paraphrasing you.
3282520	3289520	You disagree with things for the sake of it, kind of, because you find that that often is needed.
3289520	3294520	Yeah, it's like if there's too many people saying a thing, I'm like, well, they must be wrong.
3294520	3295520	Right. They have to be.
3295520	3296520	I agree with that.
3296520	3302520	But the dilemma is the world saying they love you gets complicated.
3302520	3304520	Because they're wrong.
3304520	3309520	On one hand, they must be, in your view, but on the other hand, they outnumber you greatly.
3309520	3314520	Do you think that you made any online or in-person foes or enemies during this trip?
3314520	3318520	Did you ever actually piss anybody off or rub anybody the wrong way?
3318520	3319520	I hope not.
3319520	3320520	I don't think so.
3320520	3324520	I tried my hardest not to do that.
3324520	3325520	Do you think you went on a journey?
3325520	3328520	You're probably familiar by now with my hacky story model.
3328520	3330520	You're a dungeon master.
3330520	3331520	You're a writer.
3331520	3332520	You're a storyteller.
3332520	3340520	You know that I draw this circle, and then I wrap everything around it, and it follows these eight steps.
3340520	3343520	It's all stolen from Joseph Campbell, Sid Field, and stuff.
3343520	3345520	Did you see yourself?
3345520	3347520	Do you think that you went on a little journey?
3347520	3353520	I mean, I didn't go placing myself around the wheel, but yeah, it was definitely a journey.
3353520	3354520	I learned some stuff.
3354520	3357520	I returned, hopefully, a better person.
3357520	3359520	What do you think changed about you?
3359520	3360520	What's different in your head?
3360520	3363520	I think that before, I was really afraid of social interaction.
3363520	3377520	But when you're frigging talking to 30 people who are mostly wasted in a bar 20 times in a row, that's the worst.
3377520	3379520	So everything else...
3379520	3381520	That's as bad as it gets.
3381520	3386520	Yeah, so literally, I was coming home, and I was like, my friends wanted to hang out, and I was like,
3386520	3390520	two people? That's workable.
3390520	3392520	Yeah.
3392520	3396520	I hear our $1,000 VIPs down here talking about their character sheets.
3396520	3398520	They're discussing D&D strategies.
3398520	3400520	We have two people...
3400520	3403520	Wait, for a thousand bucks, you get up on stage and play D&D?
3403520	3405520	Yeah, that's fucking Spencer.
3405520	3406520	Spencer is a rock star.
3406520	3409520	Nobody would have paid $1,000 just to get up here.
3409520	3413520	Marin only did it because he wants to plug his IFC show, you know?
3413520	3415520	All right, yeah, the initial Marin starts in May.
3415520	3417520	No, by the way, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3417520	3419520	He didn't really do it to plug it.
3419520	3423520	I did see the pilot, and I think he's got a straight shot at him.
3423520	3427520	And Bobcat, we didn't plug it. We're not really a pluggy show, but Bobcat's new film is God Bless America, right?
3427520	3429520	Yeah, go check, go check.
3429520	3434520	Also, shit, we should have talked to him about his Bigfoot movie, too.
3434520	3440520	You tried to show me the trailer for it after I abused my girlfriend and came to your hotel room,
3440520	3444520	and you offered me your pizza and tried to show me your trailer and the shitty Wi-Fi at the hotel.
3445520	3448520	But anyways, just Google Bob Goldthwaite.
3448520	3450520	Relax.
3451520	3453520	It's not the goddamn 50s.
3453520	3456520	Just go out there and consume his work.
3456520	3458520	Out there working for you.
3458520	3459520	Assholes.
3459520	3461520	Terrible people.
3461520	3464520	It's fitting that this place is called the Egyptian.
3464520	3468520	You're a bunch of tyrants, pharaohs.
3468520	3469520	This is the dark point of the show.
3469520	3471520	This is where it fits into the story circle.
3471520	3473520	This is the atonement.
3473520	3475520	Hate you.
3475520	3477520	Hate Jesus.
3477520	3479520	Hate my father.
3479520	3482520	I am my father.
3482520	3484520	Jesus is my father.
3488520	3491520	You and the podcast, I'm ripping open my shirt.
3491520	3492520	There's blood everywhere.
3492520	3494520	I'm bleeding out of my nipples.
3494520	3496520	I'm pissing into a jar.
3496520	3499520	There's a dreidel in it.
3500520	3503520	There's a bullwhip up my asses.
3504520	3506520	Now, oh, woo, resurrection.
3506520	3507520	Now we're back.
3507520	3509520	Let's have some fun.
3510520	3514520	What was I, how was I derailing, I got excited about something.
3514520	3516520	That's why I was derailing you guys.
3516520	3519520	You came up and you sat down and then you're, goddamn it.
3519520	3521520	He was just asking me how I was doing.
3521520	3522520	It wasn't a big deal.
3522520	3524520	I know, but I thought of something for some reason.
3524520	3526520	I thought of something so important, otherwise I wouldn't do that.
3526520	3529520	You said your story circle about him changing.
3529520	3531520	Anybody?
3531520	3532520	Chevy Chase.
3532520	3534520	Chevy called me back.
3534520	3535520	That's what it was.
3535520	3540520	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
3540520	3541520	Wait, what the fuck?
3541520	3543520	Impeccable timing is always.
3543520	3546520	Adam Goldberg has just stormed the stage, ladies and gentlemen.
3546520	3547520	Wow.
3547520	3549520	The story circle is completely different.
3549520	3552520	To three percent applause, Adam.
3553520	3554520	More than I deserve.
3554520	3555520	This ain't nerd melts.
3555520	3557520	This is a fucking, this is a theater full of adults.
3557520	3560520	These people, these people paid good money to be here instead of their
3560520	3562520	typical bad money.
3562520	3565520	But what brings you up here, Adam Goldberg?
3565520	3568520	Dan has come home and changed.
3568520	3569520	Huh?
3569520	3574520	Dan has changed and reached the apex of the story circle because before we got
3574520	3577520	derailed, he was doing an excellent interview with Spencer.
3577520	3579520	Oh, damn.
3579520	3580520	And that's it.
3580520	3581520	And you lent me this.
3581520	3584520	Big red left a note that I didn't read.
3584520	3589520	Does anybody have any idea what's fucking currently happening on this thing?
3591520	3597520	Adam, we went away for a while and we all changed.
3597520	3600520	But apparently you're just going to come storm the goddamn stage.
3600520	3601520	Yeah.
3601520	3603520	And do some abstruse bullshit.
3603520	3608520	The thing about Adam Goldberg is this is something, this is a typical example.
3608520	3612520	Too much information per second.
3612520	3613520	Right?
3613520	3615520	He just returned my copy of the master.
3615520	3617520	There's a note from big red.
3617520	3622520	Like if I had to, looking at it through Bob Goldthwaite's eyes, what the fuck
3622520	3623520	is going on?
3623520	3624520	Right.
3624520	3628520	And what would I need to do to explain to Bob Goldthwaite what is happening?
3628520	3633520	I would need to extrapolate that I borrowed in my, lent him my master DVD,
3633520	3634520	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3634520	3637520	Then you get into who is Adam Goldberg.
3637520	3639520	Let's talk about Adam Goldberg.
3639520	3642520	Should we get Mark Marin up to the full Jew with Adam Goldberg right now?
3642520	3643520	Please.
3644520	3646520	I think Marin might have boned out.
3646520	3648520	If he hasn't, go run.
3648520	3649520	Yeah, get out of here, Marin.
3649520	3651520	You got bigger fish to fry.
3651520	3654520	You are the Barbara Walters of everything.
3656520	3661520	The Goldberg, we met your brothers in Somerville, Massachusetts.
3661520	3662520	All right.
3662520	3665520	For those of you who are tuning in for the first time, I can't imagine any of you
3666520	3668520	would be coming here for the first time.
3668520	3671520	But Adam Goldberg is our hamburgler.
3675520	3682520	He is that part of the mythology that strengthens the mythology by his covetous
3682520	3684520	desire for it.
3684520	3686520	Like Daffy Duck wants that pearl.
3686520	3687520	Mine, mine, mine.
3687520	3690520	And the clamshell slowly closes on him.
3690520	3692520	And your heart bleeds for him.
3692520	3693520	You love to hate him.
3693520	3694520	Like the hamburgler.
3694520	3695520	He loves hamburgers.
3695520	3697520	But he never gets the fruity pebbles.
3697520	3700520	He never gets the fruity pebbles because he's the hamburgler.
3700520	3703520	If he got him, he wouldn't know what to do with him.
3703520	3706520	And Adam loves stage time.
3706520	3715520	So the people in Los Angeles who are trained to be restrained because their
3715520	3721520	star fucker muscle is strained, boom, do, do, do, I was...
3721520	3722520	No, go with that.
3722520	3725520	I want to know what the star fucker muscle is.
3725520	3729520	The people in Los Angeles, they know star fucker.
3729520	3730520	Yeah.
3730520	3731520	Star fucker.
3731520	3736520	When you live in LA, you learn if David Duchovny's behind you, don't turn.
3736520	3737520	Don't look at him.
3737520	3738520	He's a living ghost.
3738520	3739520	So what?
3739520	3740520	He was on X-Files.
3740520	3741520	Who gives a fuck?
3741520	3742520	It's the coast.
3742520	3744520	You came out here to work and be creative.
3744520	3746520	So who the fuck cares if there's famous people?
3746520	3748520	Eat your potatoes.
3748520	3754520	That's the star fucker muscle is withered here.
3754520	3757520	Goldthwaite was applauding, I guess they were.
3757520	3758520	No, I'm obsessed.
3758520	3762520	I'm doing a show to Goldthwaite.
3762520	3766520	No, but so this is my theory about you having been to Somerville and also
3766520	3769520	looking on the forums where you proudly proclaim people...
3769520	3770520	Most viewed thread.
3770520	3776520	In a thread, like everyone's like, I love Adam Goldberg electronically.
3776520	3780520	People in Los Angeles, pretty much, they roundly, like, they don't like you.
3780520	3781520	They don't want...
3781520	3784520	You're not a hero to them.
3784520	3786520	Because I took their hamburgers.
3786520	3787520	Because you took...
3787520	3790520	Because there was a plate of hamburgers out.
3790520	3791520	Ronald put it out there.
3791520	3792520	There's a rainbow.
3792520	3794520	There's fries dancing around.
3794520	3797520	It's a magical world where supposedly anyone can have anything they want
3797520	3799520	because there's no crime.
3799520	3802520	And then to you, to them, you represent the...
3802520	3804520	Yeah, it's like, oh shit.
3804520	3809520	So then I think they go, hey, I want to get up on stage two, but I don't.
3809520	3811520	Fuck this guy.
3811520	3813520	That's what I think they think.
3813520	3815520	Wow.
3815520	3816520	Bullseye.
3816520	3819520	Bob Goldthwaite's back on stage, everybody.
3819520	3822520	I'm Mayor McCheese.
3822520	3823520	Wait, wait.
3823520	3824520	No, you're done.
3824520	3825520	What's happening?
3825520	3826520	No, you're done.
3826520	3828520	I'm retiring.
3828520	3829520	What's happening?
3829520	3833520	I'm retiring as a character from Harmon Town.
3833520	3836520	Bob Goldthwaite just bounced out of Goldberg on stage.
3836520	3837520	Okay, thanks for coming.
3837520	3839520	That was great.
3839520	3843520	Is he bounced?
3843520	3849520	Bob Goldthwaite.
3849520	3854520	World's most famous bouncer.
3854520	3859520	Boy, can you come every Monday to Meltdown?
3859520	3868520	That was the best.
3868520	3871520	How was the master?
3871520	3873520	It was...
3873520	3877520	For the first 20 minutes of that movie, I couldn't wait for it to be over
3877520	3880520	so I could go tell everyone I just saw the best movie of my life.
3880520	3886520	And then for the last 80 to 600 minutes of it, I was like, okay.
3886520	3891520	Kind of riding this porpoise to the bottom of the ocean.
3891520	3894520	Ocean depth in that metaphor is movie quality.
3894520	3898520	And porpoises are deep sea animals.
3898520	3899520	Or not.
3899520	3903520	Look, hey, I'm not a metaphorologist.
3903520	3906520	I'm just a guy that wandered into a fucking movie.
3906520	3910520	But Joaquin Phoenix, what's his name?
3910520	3911520	Fake Jack Black.
3911520	3915520	Philip Seymour Hoffman.
3915520	3918520	Amazing, amazing.
3918520	3921520	I mean, you know, see the movie for Jesus Christ.
3921520	3922520	Some actors.
3922520	3923520	Holy shit.
3923520	3924520	Damn Christ.
3924520	3926520	Jesus fucking Christ, Jeff.
3926520	3930520	Jesus fucking Christ, Joaquin Phoenix, so fucking good.
3930520	3933520	Let's meet our $1,000 D&D people, shall we?
3933520	3936520	Wait, wait.

3948520	3949520	Who is it?
3949520	3953520	It's our very good friend, my podcast buddy.
3953520	3958520	The ratio of how much time I've spent with him to how much I love him is more concentrated
3958520	3960520	than any human being I know.
3960520	3961520	Get jealous.
3961520	3962520	Feel the jealousy.
3962520	3964520	Embrace the jealousy.
3964520	3970520	When you watch me make mad verbal love to Dunkin' Trussell.
3973520	3975520	Dunkin' Trussell.
3975520	3977520	Yo, Dunkin' Trussell.

3996520	3997520	Hello, Dunkin'.
3997520	3998520	Hi.
3998520	4000520	Dunkin' Trussell, everybody.
4000520	4001520	Hey, buddy.
4001520	4002520	Hi.
4003520	4004520	Hey.
4005520	4006520	Good to see you.
4006520	4007520	Hey.
4007520	4008520	Man, you're a good rapper.
4008520	4009520	Thank you, buddy.
4010520	4011520	Hi.
4012520	4015520	Dunkin' has an amazing podcast that everyone should listen to.
4015520	4018520	I was a guest on it and I listened to that episode.
4019520	4021520	And loved it.
4022520	4023520	And loved you.
4023520	4027520	We had a big talk about robots and the future of sperm.
4027520	4028520	Oh, yeah, man.
4028520	4032520	We got into the singularity and we really hit, you know, that wall you hit sometimes
4032520	4035520	where you run out of words and you're just sort of stumbling around.
4035520	4037520	That's my favorite place to get to.
4037520	4038520	We definitely got there.
4038520	4039520	It's a place called Love.
4039520	4040520	I love you.
4040520	4041520	I love you.
4042520	4046520	And we vowed to be best friends on that podcast, but we don't really hang out.
4046520	4049520	But, you know, you locked yourself in the bathroom and I came over.
4049520	4051520	Oh, yeah, you saved me.
4051520	4052520	That's right.
4052520	4055520	I forgot that was such a humiliating but awesome moment.
4055520	4056520	I did what I could.
4056520	4057520	I locked myself in my bathroom.
4057520	4058520	At my house.
4058520	4061520	I was taking a dump.
4061520	4062520	Forgive me for saying that.
4062520	4068520	And I live in this old house and it just the door just locked.
4068520	4071520	It's just like Amityville horror style locked.
4072520	4073520	And it's summer.
4073520	4075520	It was summer and it was so hot in there.
4075520	4079520	And I started hearing the narrator from those death shows in my head.
4080520	4085520	He didn't realize this would be the last dump he ever took in his life.
4086520	4088520	They found him two weeks later.
4088520	4090520	Calling out the window to neighbors.
4090520	4091520	Yeah.
4091520	4092520	That's how I ended up.
4092520	4094520	That's the really say when you're locked in your bathroom.
4094520	4095520	What do you call out of the window?
4095520	4098520	Do you say help or is that too much?
4098520	4099520	I would go.
4099520	4100520	That's too much.
4100520	4102520	I don't want to think I'm on fire.
4102520	4103520	I'll live.
4103520	4104520	I'm alone.
4106520	4109520	I live alone and I'm alone.
4110520	4114520	I'm this is this is something that happens to geriatrics.
4114520	4116520	It's like that's an elderly death.
4118520	4121520	That's where the cat choose your face off style.
4122520	4126520	I'm 12 years older than my girlfriend and we were we saw a billboard for the
4126520	4127520	for the life alert thing.
4127520	4130520	And by the way their slogan is I've fallen and I can't get up and it's
4130520	4135520	trademarked now which is like a weird thing because that's a person dying.
4137520	4140520	We know that's that's a famous saying from your thing but it's not like
4140520	4141520	where's the beef.
4141520	4143520	It's like I've fallen and I can't get up.
4143520	4144520	That's not.
4146520	4147520	I'm dying.
4148520	4151520	You're trademarking the most common thing you hear if you're a 911
4151520	4152520	dispatcher.
4152520	4153520	Yeah.
4153520	4154520	I don't know.
4154520	4155520	I don't know what's funny about it.
4155520	4156520	I know it's just funny.
4156520	4158520	It's like the opposite of trademarking the birthday song.
4158520	4162520	But we started joking about how I should get one of those because I'm 12
4162520	4163520	years older than her.
4163520	4166520	And then the joke turned into sincere like you could if you got one that
4166520	4167520	might help.
4167520	4168520	Those.
4171520	4174520	Those commercials are so existentially horrifying.
4174520	4179520	There's a line in one of those commercials this old lady says I live
4179520	4181520	alone and I don't get many visitors.
4184520	4186520	The worst way to end up.
4186520	4190520	Well we're born into these bodies and then we're like like a whole
4190520	4193520	brain and then there's a puppet and the puppets made of meat and then
4193520	4197520	there's maybe a God or maybe there isn't some somewhere in between.
4197520	4199520	No idea what's going to happen when we die.
4199520	4201520	We just know that it's going to be a drag when we do.
4201520	4202520	It's not going to be fun.
4202520	4203520	No one ever has fun when they die.
4203520	4204520	Nobody.
4204520	4205520	Oh I know.
4205520	4206520	I know.
4206520	4207520	I know.
4207520	4208520	I know.
4208520	4209520	I know.
4209520	4210520	Steve Job said oh whoa whoa whoa or whatever.
4210520	4211520	But I think he was like oh whoa.
4211520	4212520	This hurts.
4212520	4213520	Like her.
4213520	4214520	Wow.
4214520	4215520	We know.
4215520	4218520	I don't think I think I don't think death is that bad a thing at all.
4218520	4219520	That's what I'm fishing for.
4219520	4223520	My recent run in with cancer made me think that it's it's not.
4223520	4227520	Well for one the one thing you realize is that this is not new terrain.
4227520	4232520	Like you realize there's this well worn path into oblivion that they've
4232520	4234520	worked out for us already.
4234520	4236520	Like like other humans or.
4236520	4237520	For humans.
4237520	4238520	Yeah.
4238520	4239520	Like just the medical system.
4239520	4241520	I mean dying is so good these days.
4241520	4244520	The drugs are so good man.
4244520	4246520	The narcotics are incredible.
4246520	4247520	You're going to you.
4247520	4249520	Steve Jobs said wow.
4249520	4250520	Wow.
4250520	4251520	Wow.
4251520	4253520	Because he was on to lauded and narcotics.
4253520	4256520	And then he said then maybe he saw God or something.
4256520	4261520	But there's this thing Ramdha says which I've thought about a lot
4261520	4264520	which he says dying is safe.
4264520	4267520	And it's it is it's like a very safe thing.
4267520	4271520	It's the most normal thing that can happen outside of being born.
4271520	4273520	That is true because like rocks are dead.
4273520	4275520	They're everywhere.
4276520	4277520	Like aluminum is dead.
4277520	4279520	It's the most abundant element in the Earth's crowd.
4279520	4280520	Yeah.
4280520	4282520	It's like pretty no big deal to be dead.
4282520	4283520	Yeah.
4283520	4284520	It isn't a bit.
4284520	4285520	It isn't a big deal.
4285520	4287520	I mean thank goodness we.
4287520	4292520	It's as easy as falling off a log in a very specific angle that
4292520	4293520	snaps your neck.
4293520	4295520	It's preferable to living forever.
4295520	4296520	Yeah.
4296520	4297520	Probably because.
4297520	4298520	Definitely.
4298520	4299520	Yeah.
4299520	4300520	There is no I mean.
4300520	4303520	One of those things that like like we always you know where everybody
4303520	4306520	in this room is at least 25 or whatever they've all been down this
4306520	4309520	road of like OK yeah yeah yeah because you're a human being.
4309520	4312520	So if life wasn't scarce then it wouldn't be valuable.
4312520	4313520	You wouldn't enjoy it and all that stuff.
4313520	4316520	But it's like it's one of those things like when your mom says oh those
4316520	4318520	guys that beat you up shouldn't be your friends anyway.
4318520	4323520	Like you hear it but hearing it and understanding it are separate
4323520	4325520	from like realizing it in your heart.
4325520	4326520	Yes.
4326520	4328520	Understood like really getting it.
4328520	4332520	Like that whole concept of like well you're alive and you're
4332520	4335520	going to die and it sucks that you're going to die.
4335520	4338520	But because it sucks that you're going to die your life is valuable.
4338520	4342520	Otherwise it wouldn't be because you'd just be hanging out like you'd just be
4342520	4345520	like Highlander like like around the sun's going to supernova.
4345520	4349520	You're going to be floating through the void of space screaming for
4349520	4351520	infinity like one of those probes.
4351520	4353520	Well if you're immortal so does that count so that you would do the sun
4353520	4355520	would supernova and you'd just be a dude floating around.
4355520	4356520	Where are you going to stand.
4356520	4357520	I don't know.
4357520	4359520	So you just speak.
4359520	4362520	Our son would red giant first and envelop us.
4362520	4363520	We'd all cook.
4363520	4365520	You'd have to be on a ship.
4365520	4369520	I'm assuming you're immortal and you have like your skin doesn't burn out.
4369520	4370520	So I'm just imagining.
4370520	4371520	So just hanging out.
4371520	4374520	You're just it's the ultimate horror would be to be immortal.
4374520	4380520	Then you just standing in space like space ghost waiting for.
4380520	4381520	All right.
4381520	4384520	And then you start walking like in Minecraft like there's no end.
4384520	4387520	You're just like I don't know when I'm ever going to find another planet.
4388520	4390520	And then when you do everyone's like hey who are you.
4390520	4393520	And you're like my name is Ted and I can't die.
4393520	4394520	And they're like fuck you.
4394520	4395520	No you don't say.
4395520	4397520	You don't say anything when you run.
4397520	4400520	You open an antique store after six.
4400520	4401520	No.
4401520	4402520	And you wear a trench coat.
4402520	4404520	You walk around New York being bitter.
4404520	4405520	They start a religion about you.
4405520	4408520	You become a shitty deity and you'd be over it.
4408520	4409520	You'd hate it.
4409520	4410520	Yeah.
4410520	4411520	Like everything would be.
4411520	4412520	Nothing would be exciting.
4412520	4413520	You'd never be able to love anyone.
4413520	4418520	Well this is Alan Watts idea where he says if you live forever you would try everything
4418520	4423520	that you could try till eventually if you were God you'd be like oh I wonder what it's
4423520	4424520	like to be mortal.
4424520	4428520	And that's when you pop into this body and become Dan Harmon.
4428520	4429520	Huh.
4429520	4430520	Or Highlander.
4430520	4431520	Or Highlander.
4432520	4433520	But that is the idea.
4433520	4440520	That's the idea is that we're sort of like the way we have to sleep or we'll go crazy
4441520	4444520	in the same way like we're what happens when God falls asleep.
4444520	4451520	We think that we're impermanent mortal beings because the state of pure immortality for
4451520	4454520	eternity there's nothing more horrifying and claustrophobic.
4454520	4459520	So we're kind of what happens when God has a nervous breakdown and shatters into an infinite
4459520	4461520	number of nodes of consciousness.
4462520	4468520	In the beginning there was nothing and then nothing is fucking dumb and has forever to
4468520	4469520	be something.
4469520	4470520	But did.
4470520	4472520	Because otherwise it would have gone nuts.
4472520	4473520	And did.
4473520	4479520	So it split into Duncan Trussell and Dan Harmon and Spencer and Jeff and maybe a little bit
4479520	4482520	of Adam Goldberg.
4482520	4487520	And it just like looks we just look at ourselves it's just God like rubbing himself in a mirror.
4487520	4488520	Yeah.
4488520	4490520	Yeah look good in the sailor outfit.
4490520	4491520	Oh yeah.
4491520	4494520	Like every person's a little finger and like yeah.
4494520	4499520	But then the merciful Bob Goldthwaite of eternity comes and just shoes you off into nothing
4499520	4500520	this again.
4500520	4501520	I'm afraid he's going to bounce me.
4501520	4502520	Me too.
4504520	4508520	I never knew the mayor of McCheese had like I never thought of him as a mayor.
4508520	4509520	It really is.
4509520	4510520	He has power.
4510520	4513520	He was thinking Ronald Ronald Ronald Ronald's in charge.
4513520	4514520	No.
4514520	4515520	Fucking Mayor McCheese.
4515520	4516520	He's a mayor.
4516520	4517520	Ronald's a clown.
4517520	4518520	People need to look into this.
4518520	4519520	Ronald's a fucking clown.
4519520	4522520	He's like a tool of the state.
4523520	4525520	Mayor McCheese is like he barely says anything.
4525520	4526520	He's like I got shit to do.
4526520	4527520	He's like Dick Cheney.
4527520	4528520	He's sitting back on.
4528520	4529520	I don't want to be president.
4529520	4530520	Fuck.
4530520	4533520	I got a big dick and a fucking missile for a heart.
4537520	4539520	Talk talk about your balls.
4539520	4544520	Talk about the talk about talk a little bit about like like like everyone in this room
4544520	4547520	or at least half of us are at risk of testicular cancer.
4547520	4548520	Yeah.
4548520	4550520	Is that the specific.
4550520	4551520	Was that what you got.
4551520	4553520	So I got testicular cancer.
4553520	4554520	Yeah.
4554520	4555520	It's it's called.
4555520	4556520	How did you find out.
4556520	4557520	What is that.
4557520	4558520	Oh.
4558520	4559520	Testicular.
4559520	4560520	Cancer.
4560520	4561520	I just thought.
4561520	4569520	It's going to be a good time in the Egyptian talking about the cancer in your bones.
4569520	4572520	It's going to claim a song.
4572520	4576520	If it's not your prostate it'll be your nuts.
4576520	4577520	Fellas.
4577520	4579520	I'm sorry duck and that was not fair.
4579520	4580520	Well that was awesome.
4580520	4582520	I just thought you could talk about your balls.
4582520	4585520	We put on some sexy music.
4585520	4587520	How do you find out.
4587520	4588520	Well they tell you to check in the shower.
4588520	4589520	I never know what that means.
4589520	4592520	No you know this is the funny thing.
4592520	4595520	I check in the shower every time I go to the shower.
4595520	4596520	I don't know that I'm doing it.
4596520	4600520	I'm just doing it.
4600520	4603520	That was so stupid.
4603520	4605520	Are you just saying I'm jerking off in the shower.
4605520	4606520	I jerk off in the shower a lot.
4606520	4608520	You don't rub your balls.
4608520	4609520	I squeeze them like Play-Doh.
4609520	4610520	I do.
4610520	4611520	No one does that.
4611520	4614520	You don't know that.
4614520	4618520	I love rubbing my balls.
4618520	4622520	I'm getting such a heart out of squeezing my balls.
4622520	4623520	Anyways.
4623520	4625520	Can you come from rubbing your balls?
4625520	4626520	Yes.
4626520	4628520	No I can't.
4628520	4630520	Yes you can.
4630520	4634520	I think it would take like eight years.
4634520	4637520	Just watching Shakespeare in Love.
4637520	4642520	It's such a slow build.
4642520	4644520	You have to have an imagination.
4644520	4647520	If you are a mortal floating through space forever,
4647520	4650520	how many times do you think you jerk off?
4650520	4652520	You just jerk off all the time right?
4652520	4653520	That's all you do.
4653520	4657520	You fuck nebulae.
4657520	4663520	Rub cosmic dust on your nipples.
4663520	4666520	All right, so cancer.
4666520	4668520	So how do you find out?
4668520	4669520	Do you feel a pain?
4669520	4670520	Do you feel a lump?
4670520	4671520	No.
4671520	4674520	One of your balls just gets really big.
4674520	4675520	Really?
4675520	4681520	A lot of concern that people have expressed behind it
4681520	4683520	is just this terror.
4683520	4685520	They're like, how did you know?
4685520	4686520	What was it like?
4686520	4689520	Because balls are weird anyway.
4689520	4692520	So it's hard to tell if your balls are okay no matter what
4692520	4694520	because they're always wrong.
4694520	4699520	Yeah, what have they ever done that looks normal?
4699520	4703520	Have you ever laid in bed and watched them fucking move around?
4703520	4704520	They're terrible.
4704520	4706520	They're terrible.
4706520	4709520	Adjust to the temperature?
4709520	4711520	This happens to everyone, right?
4711520	4714520	Are my balls a snail?
4714520	4718520	This is amazing.
4718520	4721520	They're just moving like lava.
4721520	4724520	This one goes out to the ladies in the house.
4724520	4725520	Balls move.
4725520	4728520	You better get used to it.
4728520	4731520	You think it's fun and games to play with them,
4731520	4732520	but there's a lot more to them.
4732520	4739520	They're pretty gross and weird.
4739520	4741520	So yeah, they're weird, and then they dangle,
4741520	4744520	and then they don't dangle, and then once it's lower,
4744520	4745520	once it's higher.
4745520	4748520	And always, the doctors go like,
4748520	4749520	all right, check your balls.
4749520	4751520	When you're in the shower, just squeeze them around.
4751520	4754520	When you went to college, there were stickers on the shower stall
4754520	4756520	showing diagrams.
4756520	4758520	I'm not going to do that to my balls.
4758520	4759520	Me either.
4759520	4760520	Like fucking squeeze them.
4760520	4763520	They wanted you to squeeze them like a fucking,
4763520	4768520	I don't know, like a thing from a discovery store.
4768520	4769520	I don't know.
4769520	4770520	I'm trying to think.
4770520	4772520	Like fucking get in there.
4773520	4774520	Great.
4774520	4776520	I don't have cancer, but I fucking mangled my...
4776520	4777520	Yeah.
4777520	4781520	I'm holding my balls out of protection,
4781520	4782520	talking about it.
4782520	4783520	All right.
4783520	4785520	It was no mystery for me.
4785520	4788520	It was like one of my balls was big.
4788520	4790520	It was like, this is definitely...
4790520	4791520	And when you touched it, did it hurt?
4791520	4792520	It didn't hurt.
4792520	4794520	It was just, it was weighty.
4794520	4796520	It was like kind of cool.
4796520	4801520	It was like, ah, look at this big ball.
4801520	4805520	When did your mind immediately go, okay.
4805520	4809520	My mind is always going to like, this is what kills me.
4809520	4813520	So I immediately was like, oh, this is probably what kills you.
4813520	4816520	And then I Google searched, you know, the symptoms
4816520	4818520	and everything's cancer, cancer, cancer.
4818520	4820520	And then I went to the doctor and the doctor's like,
4820520	4822520	yeah, this is cancer.
4822520	4824520	Did you Google on a Friday?
4824520	4825520	That always happens to me.
4825520	4827520	Like I'll get a lump on my neck or something
4827520	4830520	and then I'll Google lump on neck cancer.
4830520	4833520	Low and behold, number one hit, lump on neck
4833520	4834520	could mean you have cancer.
4834520	4836520	And I'm like, oh shit, it's Friday.
4836520	4837520	It's eight o'clock.
4837520	4841520	Just sit here for the weekend with cancer.
4841520	4843520	Cancer eraser on my neck.
4843520	4845520	And then on Monday it falls off.
4845520	4847520	I'm like, oh, I'm Polish.
4847520	4849520	This is a fucking skin tag.
4849520	4851520	I'm like gross fucking shrek.
4851520	4853520	It's just like shit growing on me.
4853520	4854520	I'm Ben Grimm.
4854520	4855520	What are, what is that?
4855520	4856520	What are skin tags?
4856520	4857520	That's a Polish thing.
4857520	4858520	They call them Polish moles.
4859520	4861520	You get like skin tags.
4861520	4862520	No shit.
4862520	4863520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4863520	4864520	Like random shit.
4864520	4865520	Like polyps.
4865520	4866520	It's a Polish thing.
4866520	4867520	Wow.
4867520	4870520	It's kind of like a polyp, yeah.
4870520	4871520	Hey, guys.
4871520	4872520	Hey.
4872520	4874520	Oh, hey, Spencer.
4874520	4877520	I meant to do Spencer's theme so he could do like.
4877520	4884520	Spencer, I'm being attacked by a growth, a skin tag.
4884520	4886520	Clawing feverishly at your neck.
4886520	4889520	You try to remove the odd skin tab.
4889520	4893520	The small square may be rounded oval.
4893520	4897520	Oddly colored flesh popping out of the side of your neck.
4897520	4898520	Are you dying?
4898520	4902520	Probably not, but it's weird.
4902520	4903520	Nice.
4907520	4911520	It fails to save versus your shirt collar over a weekend of drinking
4911520	4913520	and then just falls off.
4913520	4918520	People tell you not to pick it because it might give you cancer.
4918520	4920520	Are you all in the clear now, Duncan?
4920520	4924520	Statistically, I'm in the 95, 90.
4924520	4925520	Well, it's like between 90.
4925520	4929520	There's a 10% chance I'm still fucked, basically.
4929520	4932520	What does still fucked mean that it goes to the other ball?
4932520	4933520	Well, no.
4933520	4936520	It's the cool thing about testicular cancer and.
4936520	4938520	The coolest thing.
4938520	4939520	The coolest thing.
4939520	4942520	It's a very lazy week.
4942520	4947520	It's like cancer with a baseball cap on backwards cancer.
4947520	4949520	It's like a pathetic.
4949520	4952520	It's cancer that shows your balls.
4955520	4958520	Not ambitious enough for your brain or your pancreas.
4958520	4966520	It's a chest bumping mall shopping universal city walk kind of cancer.
4966520	4968520	Yes, exactly.
4968520	4972520	It'll broaden itself when Quentin Tarantino makes it.
4972520	4974520	I don't know what kind of cancer you got left.
4974520	4976520	I'll take the balls, man.
4976520	4978520	Pick ball cancer if you get to pick.
4978520	4980520	Pick ball cancer because it's the most curable kind,
4980520	4985520	which is why everybody says check your balls because if you catch it.
4985520	4990520	When Lance Armstrong caught it, he was coughing up blood.
4990520	4993520	One of his balls was the size of an orange.
4993520	4994520	He just ignored it.
4994520	4996520	He ignored it because he was riding his bike
4996520	5000520	and he was jacked up on awesome, weird sports drugs.
5000520	5002520	I'm like, fuck it.
5002520	5007520	And he was like, I'm sure something I did has, yeah.
5007520	5008520	I ride a bike for a living.
5008520	5010520	That has to be related to that.
5010520	5014520	But it had gone into his brain and they still cured it,
5014520	5018520	which is why everyone says check because if you catch it at the right time,
5018520	5022520	like when I caught it, there's like a 95% curate with it.
5023520	5025520	Guys, all the guys stand up and reach over,
5025520	5028520	put your right hand out and reach over to your neighbor.
5028520	5030520	If we're going to do it, we're going to do it.
5030520	5031520	Save your neighbor's life.
5031520	5032520	Ball check.
5032520	5033520	Everybody, yes.
5033520	5037520	Do what the man next to you refuses to do for himself.
5037520	5040520	Just get in there and like a key chain.
5040520	5044520	Pretend you're locking your car.
5044520	5046520	That's what they want you to do.
5046520	5050520	Save a hermenean.
5050520	5051520	Fucking cancer.
5051520	5056520	I'm not taking a risky stance here.
5056520	5057520	Well, no.
5057520	5060520	I read this incredible thing that cancer,
5060520	5065520	they think is like a primordial version of us or something like from way,
5065520	5067520	way, way back in the distance.
5067520	5068520	I don't know.
5068520	5076520	Like I just because cancer is a stutterer to society.
5076520	5080520	Cancer is a cell that goes insane.
5080520	5083520	It doesn't play on the same team as its fellow.
5083520	5086520	It's Occupy Wall Street in your balls.
5086520	5088520	It doesn't.
5088520	5092520	It forgets that it's a part of a bone.
5092520	5095520	I'm going to try something new.
5095520	5096520	I'm just me.
5096520	5098520	I bane.
5098520	5103520	The city of bone is now free.
5103520	5106520	It's just a bone.
5106520	5112520	And I guess that would be probably the precursor of multicellular life
5112520	5116520	because tissue is cells knowing how to play on a team.
5116520	5120520	And before that, we were unicellular organisms who just multiplied at all costs.
5120520	5124520	So it is kind of ironic that like all these years later,
5124520	5126520	these biological weapons called humanity,
5126520	5132520	like these fucking giant brains that have turned wolves into chihuahuas
5132520	5140520	and giraffes into curiosities and fire into, you know, just more fire.
5140520	5146520	But I could go on and on.
5146520	5147520	Yeah.
5147520	5150520	I was like, oh, I mean, in your nuts, like one little like this thing
5150520	5155520	from the year six billion, trillion B.C. goes like, surprise, inward.
5155520	5158520	Yeah.
5158520	5160520	Remember your roots, motherfucker.
5160520	5161520	Yeah.
5161520	5162520	It's very strange.
5162520	5163520	Yeah.
5163520	5164520	It's a very strange disease.
5164520	5166520	And it's very different.
5166520	5172520	Every type is like so different that some of them should maybe have different names,
5172520	5175520	which is why some respond to different types of chemo.
5175520	5179520	This type that I have responds really well to radiation, which fucking sucks.
5179520	5183520	So I don't want to, I mean, but I want to follow through this line because, okay.
5183520	5186520	So you had, did you have the thing removed?
5186520	5191520	I had to get my, I mean, they, the doctor was so eager to chop off my balls.
5191520	5195520	Once he found out I had it, he's like, we should do this on Tuesday.
5195520	5196520	I went in.
5196520	5198520	We should do this every week.
5198520	5199520	For two weeks.
5199520	5202520	We should have Bob Goldway come out.
5202520	5203520	Yeah.
5203520	5206520	So yeah, immediately they just go, fuck that, get that out of there.
5206520	5207520	Yeah, we got to get this out of here.
5207520	5209520	But you just came here tonight from radiation.
5209520	5215520	Well, not, no, my radiation ended on Friday, but I'm still super tired from it.
5215520	5218520	Radiation is crazy.
5218520	5221520	It's the most absurd insane.
5221520	5226520	I felt like I was in a Fellini movie because they put you in this like,
5226520	5229520	because they want you to feel safe.
5229520	5233520	They designed the radiation machine to look kind of sleek like a Mercedes or
5233520	5234520	something.
5234520	5239520	It looks like really fancy, but it also looks like a transformer.
5239520	5243520	It's like this living weird thing with arms that you have to land.
5243520	5248520	And they put this steel cup over your balls and you have to like push your
5248520	5252520	cock into the steel cup and you're laying in this most vulnerable way.
5252520	5255520	And they fucking play Celine Dion.
5255520	5256520	No.
5256520	5259520	Yes.
5259520	5260520	Yes.
5260520	5264520	This is like Jacob's ladder level hell that's happening here in some kind of
5264520	5266520	hell dimension.
5266520	5269520	They build all that shit and they can't ask you what you want to hear.
5270520	5274520	Well, finally, eventually I got them to play what I wanted to.
5274520	5277520	But the first time you're just so horrified.
5280520	5282520	That's actually the radiation.
5282520	5287520	They shoot Coldplay and the air and it kills you.
5287520	5290520	And the cancer and your balls is like, I'm out of here.
5292520	5295520	I heard there's a corn concert in his lungs.
5299520	5301520	Spring break is over, man.
5301520	5303520	Coldplay showed up.
5303520	5306520	Too fucking, too thoughtful.
5306520	5309520	Not enough rape.
5311520	5315520	You know, yeah, every once in a while I'll just throw in the word rape to get your
5315520	5317520	reaction.
5317520	5322520	Can I ask what you actually when you took control of the playlist, what did you
5322520	5324520	sit our music?
5324520	5325520	Okay.
5325520	5326520	Like Ravi Shankar.
5326520	5327520	Yes, exactly.
5327520	5328520	Yeah.
5329520	5330520	Nothing works.
5330520	5332520	There's no good music for radiation.
5332520	5333520	Not at all.
5333520	5336520	You're still in a machine and you're like this.
5336520	5338520	These things are spinning around you.
5338520	5340520	I think that's why they probably give you Celine Dion.
5340520	5342520	Like you didn't like her anyway.
5342520	5344520	We don't want to ruin your favorite band.
5344520	5345520	Exactly.
5345520	5347520	We're like if Tori Amos is playing.
5347520	5348520	Okay.
5348520	5350520	Well, that's it for this album.
5350520	5352520	Whether I make it through or not.
5352520	5354520	You don't get the kinks in there.
5355520	5358520	Your favorite song just scratched off your life forever.
5358520	5360520	It's like when you get food.
5360520	5361520	Hello, hello.
5361520	5363520	I got food poisoning and had a falafel.
5363520	5365520	Like falafels were off the list for a long time.
5365520	5366520	Yeah.
5366520	5367520	Yeah.
5367520	5368520	I can't drink gin.
5368520	5369520	Yeah.
5369520	5370520	You don't want it.
5370520	5371520	Don't take the kinks into your testable of radiation.
5371520	5372520	No.
5372520	5373520	Don't.
5373520	5374520	And other life lessons.
5374520	5376520	Well, thank God you're okay.
5376520	5377520	Thanks.
5377520	5379520	But they're going to tell you later.
5379520	5381520	I'm sure it's all I don't know.
5381520	5387520	You know, one of my friends said, like when I told him there's a 95% chance that I'm cured.
5387520	5393520	He said, oh, well, that just means there's a 95% chance you're going to die of something else.
5393520	5396520	Actually, Mel Brooks just called.
5396520	5399520	He gave you 80% chance.
5399520	5404520	That was, that was, Sony told me when Community got picked up for its second season.
5404520	5405520	They said, congratulations.
5405520	5410520	Now, if you get canceled, you've wasted twice as much money.
5410520	5411520	Yuck.
5411520	5416520	They're a good company.
5416520	5423520	They bring good things to slow death.
5423520	5426520	Not to equate your balls with Sony or anything.
5426520	5428520	So, all right.
5428520	5429520	Well, I don't know.
5429520	5430520	God damn it.
5430520	5432520	I mean, so it's all going to be, it's all a big haze.
5432520	5436520	Like they're, the doctors are going to like let you know in the coming weeks.
5436520	5437520	Well, no.
5437520	5438520	I mean, I get to see, I'm going to get CT.
5438520	5444520	I get to look forward to CT scans like three times a year for the next four years.
5444520	5446520	So just to make sure it hasn't spread.
5446520	5447520	It sounds terrible, man.
5447520	5452520	But like really, once you get like the water thrown in your face, it's, it's not, it's
5452520	5453520	not bad at all.
5453520	5458520	I kind of imagine it would recalibrate your life in a way that makes telling your landlord
5458520	5459520	to fuck off easier.
5459520	5460520	Easier.
5460520	5461520	So easy, man.
5461520	5466520	But that's where ever the, like we're all in the exact same boat.
5466520	5472520	It's just, I happened to get, get like a firsthand glimpse of mortality, but everyone's
5472520	5476520	this, everyone should not be afraid of telling their landlord to fuck off.
5476520	5482520	You know, it's, it's, it's a, you know, you end up going deep into cliche land when you
5482520	5489520	have cancer because everyone that's well dying is like this well trod path.
5489520	5490520	Everyone goes down.
5490520	5495520	So the thing where they're like, man, I really like appreciate life now.
5495520	5497720	I'm like, I'm so happy to be alive.
5497720	5503840	All that stuff really happens, but you don't need cancer to, to, to be happy about your
5503840	5504840	life.
5504840	5515520	You just need Celine Dion, Duncan Trussell, Duncan Trussell, thank you.
5515520	5521520	I'm out of pocket with a Duncan Trussell.
5521520	5527520	Yo, yo, had a Duncan Trussell, got a Duncan Trussell, got a Duncan Trussell.
5527520	5529520	I got a Kermit frog feet.
5529520	5531520	I'm a bar stool.
5531520	5534520	I'm a Muppet waving my feet.
5534520	5537520	Duncan Trussell came up and his cancer was a treat.
5537520	5541520	He treated you to the glimpse of the abyss.
5541520	5547520	Fuck your mama so hard, she started to piss into a cup and I drank that shit.
5547520	5550520	And then I rubbed it on my face and her tits.
5550520	5553520	And then I put my little wiener in between those things.
5553520	5555520	And I said, fuck you.
5555520	5557520	I'm going to make you sing.
5557520	5562520	And she said, la, la, la, la, Dan Harmon's fucking me.
5562520	5566520	I'm your mama.
5566520	5570520	Duncan Trussell, everyone.
5571520	5576520	I mean, don't be jealous of him.
5576520	5578520	You can see how much I love him.
5578520	5579520	I know.
5579520	5582520	The first time you met him, you had this giant kind of...
5582520	5584520	I'm sure that happens to everybody.
5584520	5586520	And actually, I've been told that that happens to everybody.
5586520	5587520	And I get pissed at them.
5587520	5588520	I go, fuck you.
5588520	5590520	It's not special.
5590520	5592520	I met Duncan at a bar very briefly and said hello.
5592520	5593520	And I loved him.
5593520	5594520	He's a lovable guy.
5594520	5595520	I mean, what are you...
5595520	5596520	Yeah.
5596520	5597520	What are we doing?
5597520	5598520	Let's get out of here.
5598520	5599520	Let's get out with Duncan Trussell.
5599520	5601520	Not until he plays from D&D, though.
5601520	5605520	Dungeons and Dragons go to be played in the Egyptian...
5608520	5612520	This place was built to play Dungeons and Dragons.
5612520	5614520	Let's bring up our guest, Dan.
5614520	5620520	Our VIP guests that supported this show
5620520	5625520	and achieved the top-tier prize of playing Dungeons and Dragons with us.
5625520	5627520	Let's bring them up right now.
5627520	5628520	Guys, come up.
5628520	5630520	It's Sean.
5630520	5634520	One of them is our old friend, Sean Sakaman,
5634520	5638520	aka SnapTheJab,
5638520	5641520	the most offensive Twitter name in the world,
5641520	5644520	because apparently he's half Japanese,
5644520	5646520	but he doesn't look at the Japanese enough
5646520	5650520	to have the name SnapTheJab on Twitter.
5650520	5652520	Yes, so Sean Sakaman, Roy McClurg, everybody.
5652520	5654520	A thousand-dollar donator.
5654520	5656520	Holy shit.
5656520	5659520	Discretionary money and no idea what to do with it.
5659520	5665520	Roy, let's get these guys mic'd up.
5665520	5666520	There's one on the floor.
5666520	5668520	I got one on the floor.
5668520	5671520	Also, I suppose...
5671520	5674520	Let's meet these two before we bring Aaron up.
5674520	5675520	How about that?
5675520	5676520	Yeah.
5676520	5681520	Sean, you've been a very original, long-time, Hermentown fan.
5681520	5682520	I have, yeah.
5682520	5683520	Come forward.
5683520	5684520	Step to the edge of the stage so folks can see you all.
5684520	5687520	Sean is like the Morgan...
5687520	5689520	Wait, what's the name of...
5689520	5691520	I was going to say Morgan Freeman,
5691520	5695520	but his character is Lucius Fox in the Batman universe,
5695520	5698520	of Hermentown.
5698520	5700520	There's always a bottle of vodka backstage
5700520	5702520	at Nerd Mounts from Sean.
5702520	5704520	Well, I mean, you give so much.
5704520	5705520	It's only fair to give back.
5705520	5706520	Thank you.
5706520	5707520	Thank you, Sean.
5707520	5708520	Thank you.
5708520	5709520	Thank you.
5709520	5712520	And Roy, how do you come to us?
5713520	5716520	I flew here from Dallas today.
5716520	5717520	Yeah.
5717520	5718520	We're...
5718520	5719520	My wife and I...
5719520	5722520	My wife, who is at the hotel right now...
5722520	5724520	Oh, she does not like the show.
5724520	5728520	I explained the show to her and she was a little taken aback
5728520	5732520	by the fact that we're going to play D&D and talk about dicks.
5734520	5736520	And it cost a thousand dollars.
5736520	5737520	Yeah.
5737520	5739520	Maybe you oversold it.
5739520	5740520	A little bit.
5740520	5741520	A little bit.
5741520	5743520	Did she ever listen to it?
5743520	5745520	I made her listen to one of them.
5745520	5747520	Which one?
5747520	5748520	It doesn't matter.
5748520	5749520	Pittsburgh.
5749520	5750520	Pittsburgh.
5750520	5751520	Pittsburgh.
5751520	5752520	Oh, she didn't like that?
5752520	5753520	There was raw emotion there.
5753520	5755520	No, she liked that part.
5755520	5757520	But she didn't think it would happen tonight.
5757520	5758520	All right.
5758520	5759520	She just...
5759520	5761520	No, she said it's just not...
5761520	5762520	What's her name?
5762520	5763520	Penny.
5763520	5764520	Penny.
5764520	5765520	Give me a beat.
5765520	5766520	Yeah, please.
5766520	5767520	Please.
5767520	5768520	Awesome.
5769520	5773520	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
5773520	5774520	I bugged Penny.
5774520	5776520	I didn't do it many times.
5776520	5778520	But I did it with rhymes.
5778520	5780520	A wiener in her butt and a wiener in her mouth.
5780520	5782520	He's where Penny...
5782520	5783520	South.
5783520	5784520	I bugged Penny.
5784520	5785520	I loved it.
5785520	5787520	Penny, are you listening?
5787520	5788520	No.
5789520	5790520	That's why I bugged ya.
5790520	5791520	Bucked ya.
5791520	5792520	Bucked ya.
5792520	5793520	Bucked ya.
5793520	5794520	Bucked ya.
5794520	5795520	Bucked Penny.
5795520	5796520	Bucked her.
5796520	5797520	Bucked her.
5797520	5799520	That was angrier than normal, Dan.
5799520	5800520	That was angry.
5800520	5803520	That was misogyny factor nine.
5803520	5804520	I don't like it.
5804520	5806520	You know, yeah, yeah, I...
5806520	5808520	Did you take my drink?
5808520	5810520	I may have, yeah.
5810520	5811520	I had a drink just here.
5811520	5812520	I'm sorry.
5812520	5814520	I did warn her about that.
5814520	5816520	About Dan...
5816520	5817520	Rap-fucking her?
5817520	5818520	Yes.
5818520	5819520	How are we doing on time again?
5819520	5822520	Apparently she was good with it.
5822520	5825520	Yeah, do we have to be out here by a specific time?
5825520	5826520	Do we care?
5826520	5830520	The master is playing 9.30.
5832520	5833520	All right, guys, have a seat.
5833520	5836520	Let's bring Aaron McGathey to the stage as well.
5843520	5844520	Aaron McGathey.
5845520	5846520	You said Roy.
5846520	5847520	It's Roy, right?
5847520	5849520	You said you were in town for the Grammys, right?
5849520	5850520	Yes, sir.
5850520	5851520	Why?
5851520	5852520	What was it?
5852520	5854520	Because my wife, who's not here,
5854520	5859520	bid on a big auction item last year to go to the Grammys.
5859520	5862520	It was just like a... Jesus Christ, you haven't...
5862520	5863520	Hello.
5863520	5864520	Like, like, just...
5864520	5866520	So she's not...
5866520	5868520	She's a slave.
5868520	5871520	She bid on an auction item that resulted in her...
5871520	5872520	Like, like, she...
5872520	5874520	She kind of won a contest or like...
5874520	5875520	Yeah.
5875520	5876520	Like, for a charity.
5876520	5877520	Yeah, for a charity.
5877520	5878520	Like, like, for...
5878520	5880520	Grammy, Grammy Foundation.
5880520	5881520	Thank you.
5881520	5882520	Thank you.
5883520	5884520	Overqualified for that job.
5885520	5886520	So then you get to go to the Grammys.
5886520	5887520	Do you get good seats?
5887520	5889520	Or do they sit you in the back?
5889520	5890520	I think we have good seats.
5890520	5891520	I think.
5891520	5892520	I'm not sure.
5892520	5893520	Hey, guys.
5893520	5894520	Hello, Aaron.
5895520	5896520	Aaron.
5897520	5898520	I wanted...
5898520	5902520	You were talking to Bob earlier about our fight in the hotel room.
5903520	5907520	And first of all, such a huge fan of yours would have...
5907520	5911520	So excited when you were in Atlanta and really wanted to meet you
5911520	5913520	and miss you because I was doing merchandise.
5914520	5917520	Dan and I got in this terrible fight, which we talked about...
5917520	5918520	The fight that we described...
5918520	5921520	Now our fights are like little babies that we created along the road.
5921520	5923520	The fight that we described at the Arlington Podcast,
5923520	5926520	which led to Pittsburgh, was that fight.
5926520	5929520	And Dan said a lot of things to me and left the room.
5929520	5930520	And I was shaking and crying.
5930520	5932520	And then I got a text from him that was like,
5932520	5937520	Hey, I'm hanging out with Bob both way across the street or across the hall.
5937520	5938520	Yeah.
5938520	5940520	And I wanted to go so badly.
5940520	5944520	But I looked like an octopus that had been run over.
5944520	5946520	I was covered in tears and a big mess.
5946520	5947520	That's what I do.
5947520	5948520	That's how I abuse you.
5948520	5949520	I'm like, you're nothing.
5949520	5950520	I know you're a big fan of comedy.
5950520	5951520	You're a piece of shit.
5951520	5952520	You're a big piece of shit.
5952520	5953520	Hey, Richard Dawson.
5953520	5954520	What's up?
5954520	5955520	Whoo.
5956520	5957520	Hanging out.
5957520	5959520	Family Feud, motherfucker.
5960520	5963520	Wish you were here, biatch.
5964520	5968520	I'm also embarrassed that you heard our fight.
5968520	5969520	I don't know.
5969520	5971520	Like I wonder what he heard.
5971520	5977520	I mean, this was our fight that we had about me offering you a ride in a van
5977520	5979520	and you getting upset about that.
5979520	5982520	So a lot of van talk.
5983520	5986520	And a lot of you're welcome that I brought you on the tour talk.
5986520	5987520	Right.
5987520	5990520	Well, because the cycle that you and I get into is when like you feel
5990520	5996520	disrespected by me and then you go, oh, you Pittsburgh too.
5997520	5998520	You don't appreciate me.
5998520	6000520	And then I go, I don't appreciate you.
6000520	6001520	Well, guess what?
6002520	6003520	Guess what?
6003520	6004520	Fuck you.
6004520	6005520	I've appreciated you so much.
6005520	6006520	You know.
6007520	6008520	We have a lot of fun, you guys.
6008520	6009520	You have to make fun.
6009520	6010520	I let you breathe at night.
6010520	6012520	I don't strangle you to death.
6013520	6014520	You're welcome.
6015520	6017520	Your throat's just sitting there.
6019520	6021520	You won the lottery with me.
6022520	6024520	An animal would kill you.
6025520	6029520	I mean, for all your talk of you being an abusive boyfriend,
6030520	6032520	we really are best friends.
6032520	6033520	And I'm a crazy person.
6033520	6037520	I'm not a, you know, it's fine.
6037520	6039520	I'm saying this to Bob.
6041520	6043520	We're best friends.
6048520	6051520	This feels terrible.
6051520	6054520	Bob is actually strangling his wife over here.
6054520	6057520	Can we get a spotlight over here?
6061520	6065520	I feel so bad because I have a podcast about relationships
6065520	6068520	and I get on my high horse frequently about what's healthy
6068520	6069520	and what's not.
6074520	6076520	Do you still want to move in with me?
6076520	6077520	Yes.
6077520	6078520	All right.
6078520	6079520	Let's move in together.
6080520	6081520	We did it.
6081520	6082520	Wow.
6082520	6083520	We created a story.
6085520	6087520	Don't you guys already live together, though?
6087520	6088520	Basically.
6088520	6090520	You've been to her apartment one time, right?
6090520	6091520	I've been, yeah.
6091520	6093520	Literally, he slept over one time.
6093520	6094520	Yeah, that's okay.
6094520	6095520	That's hard.
6096520	6099520	Also, guys, we have a big announcement.
6099520	6106520	We are getting a puppy.
6106520	6107520	All right.
6110520	6112520	Gross in the mouth.
6112520	6113520	Gross in the mouth.
6116520	6119520	Also, I cut myself.
6120520	6122520	Little triangle patterns.
6124520	6127520	I just carved Dan into my thighs.
6129520	6131520	When you laugh, it makes me think that you kind of think
6131520	6134520	that that could be true, but it's not remotely.
6134520	6135520	Not remotely.
6135520	6136520	All right.
6136520	6138520	Spencer, did you give characters to...
6138520	6139520	Wait.
6139520	6140520	You guys.
6140520	6141520	I gave characters.
6141520	6142520	Come back here.
6142520	6143520	No.
6143520	6144520	Roy, sit on me.
6144520	6145520	No.
6145520	6146520	You guys got to sit.
6146520	6147520	Sit on what?
6147520	6148520	Sit on what?
6148520	6150520	Harmon, Harmon, you can stand and stalk the stage.
6150520	6151520	Exactly.
6151520	6153520	Like the second-level mage that you are.
6153520	6156520	Sit like the gods you are with the Egyptian.
6158520	6159520	All right.
6159520	6162520	So, Spencer, you have a tall task in front of you.
6162520	6164520	Now, you've got two more characters in the stage.
6164520	6165520	That's cool.
6165520	6170520	If you don't mind, bring us up to date on our campaign.
6171520	6173520	Are you going to music her?
6175520	6177520	Not if you're going to be a dick about it.
6177520	6178520	Well, okay.
6178520	6179520	I have the volume down, okay?
6179520	6180520	I'm sorry.
6180520	6181520	Not possible.
6181520	6182520	All right.
6182520	6184520	Do you want me to distribute the sheets first
6184520	6186520	or at the same time as talking?
6186520	6187520	I got it, man.
6187520	6188520	All right.
6188520	6190520	Well, that one's yours, man.
6190520	6191520	Do you need anything?
6191520	6193520	This is your new spell list.
6194520	6195520	That's yours.
6195520	6196520	We have our sheets.
6196520	6197520	Yeah, that's the adventure.
6197520	6200520	This is great podcast talk.
6200520	6203520	Looks like in the end we're going to fight a war.
6203520	6205520	Well, you can't read.
6207520	6208520	It doesn't say that.
6208520	6210520	All right, Spencer, take it away.
6211520	6214520	On the last episode, our heroes had been trapped
6214520	6218520	within the deep and mystical magical infinifish
6218520	6219520	for what seemed like an eternity.
6219520	6220520	I'm sorry.
6220520	6221520	Mystical?
6221520	6222520	Sorry, what?
6222520	6224520	Critical chasms.
6224520	6225520	Who can't read now?
6225520	6228520	This guy right here.
6228520	6231520	Who's got a 20-sided die and can't read?
6231520	6233520	I can't do math either.
6233520	6234520	I'm sorry.
6234520	6235520	Go ahead, go ahead.
6235520	6237520	I'm going to miss my musical cue this time.
6237520	6238520	No, you still got it.
6238520	6240520	After meeting with a village of fish-willing humans
6240520	6242520	and a master swordsman named Valis,
6242520	6244520	our heroes found and destroyed various organs
6244520	6246520	in a quest to escape their living prison.
6246520	6248520	Slipping down a slippery fight,
6248520	6250520	they found a magical tome before coming
6250520	6252520	on one of the beast's great hearts.
6252520	6254520	After a long fight, the gang was on the ropes.
6254520	6256520	Just when they thought all hope was lost,
6256520	6258520	a long-lost ally reappeared.
6258520	6260520	Tylenol with Cody!
6260520	6262520	With the aid of the mystical unicorn,
6262520	6264520	the party was able to destroy the beast's heart.
6264520	6265520	The heart defeated.
6265520	6267520	The great beast fell out of the sky,
6267520	6269520	crashing to Earth with a catastrophic crash.
6269520	6271520	A catastrophic crash.
6271520	6273520	And a sickening splat.
6273520	6275520	You feel yourselves being plugged into the wall
6275520	6277520	and all the flesh in the chamber convulses,
6277520	6279520	expanding and trapping you within its great hole.
6279520	6281520	You feel your bodies being squeezed,
6281520	6283520	compressed, crushed,
6283520	6285520	perhaps my feet bend,
6285520	6287520	and the squelch of liquefying tissues.
6287520	6289520	Its side bursts open and your party is squirted out
6289520	6291520	in a bolus of fleshy bits,
6291520	6293520	slimy fluids, and bloody chunks.
6293520	6296520	You land unceremoniously in a heap.
6298520	6300520	Spencer!
6300520	6302520	You were only three seconds over,
6302520	6304520	but that was my fault.
6304520	6306520	Yep.
6307520	6309520	That is some real dungeon mastering.
6309520	6311520	So are we on the ground?
6311520	6313520	You're on the ground in a big pile of each other,
6313520	6314520	and you're full of...
6314520	6316520	You're swimming in fish fluids.
6316520	6318520	It's just gross.
6320520	6321520	Sharpie!
6321520	6323520	Oh, mole rain.
6323520	6325520	You have fissera in your hair.
6325520	6327520	Oh.
6327520	6328520	It's embarrassing.
6328520	6331520	Hey, why don't you guys move in together
6331520	6333520	and get a puppy?
6334520	6337520	Maybe one day we will, little man,
6337520	6339520	when we've finished our journeys.
6339520	6341520	It's settled down.
6341520	6343520	But what are we really questing for?
6343520	6345520	We've been doing this for so long.
6345520	6347520	What is it that we're really going after?
6347520	6349520	We got swallowed by the infinifish.
6349520	6350520	I know.
6350520	6352520	And then that way laid us from the task
6352520	6354520	of going to rescue my father, I think.
6354520	6356520	Yeah.
6356520	6360520	So can we still rescue your father, Sharpie?
6360520	6362520	We could.
6363520	6365520	I mean, I've never liked him,
6365520	6367520	but I've always wanted his approval.
6367520	6369520	I feel like I got that,
6369520	6371520	so we could let him die.
6373520	6375520	Yeah, you guys found closure there, I think.
6375520	6378520	My fathers are only good for approval.
6378520	6380520	After that, like, what are they doing?
6380520	6381520	They're not...
6381520	6384520	Their job is done when they come, right?
6384520	6387520	In the most technical terms.
6387520	6389520	Like, they're not mothers.
6389520	6391520	They don't nurse you.
6392520	6395520	My father taught me how to wear a breastplate
6395520	6397520	and swing a sword.
6398520	6401520	Well, maybe we should go hang out with him.
6402520	6405520	Yeah, I care about him, I guess.
6405520	6409520	Well, why don't we explore our surroundings?
6409520	6412520	You explore your surroundings.
6412520	6415520	I should say, after defeating the great infinifish,
6415520	6418520	you feel a lot wiser and stronger as a result.
6418520	6420520	What?
6420520	6422520	Oh, shit.
6422520	6423520	You level up.
6423520	6426520	Level up!
6432520	6435520	Bob don't wait, doesn't know what's going on.
6435520	6437520	Buddy's here, buddy stayed,
6437520	6439520	and he's not going away.
6439520	6441520	He might soon.
6441520	6443520	And now we called him out, I feel obligated.
6443520	6445520	Please feel obligated.
6445520	6447520	So, are we level three now, Spencer?
6447520	6448520	You're level four at this point.
6448520	6449520	Holy smoke!
6449520	6450520	That is crazy.
6450520	6451520	Yeah, man.
6451520	6452520	Do I have an animal yet?
6452520	6454520	As it happens, at level four,
6454520	6456520	you gain an animal companion.
6456520	6458520	Yes, please.
6458520	6460520	What kind of companion do you want?
6460520	6462520	Oh, I didn't know I got to choose.
6466520	6469520	God, I don't want to be Meg Ryan,
6469520	6471520	but what are my options?
6471520	6473520	You mean just a couple seconds here?
6473520	6475520	When Harry met Sally, it doesn't really work
6475520	6477520	because she was just refining her order.
6478520	6481520	She's famous for option exploration.
6481520	6483520	I'll have what she's having.
6483520	6485520	She's very particular.
6485520	6486520	Is there a fox?
6486520	6487520	I'm going to shoot off some animals.
6487520	6488520	Can I have a fox?
6488520	6490520	Badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog,
6490520	6494520	eagle, hawk, horse, owl, pony, snake, wolf.
6494520	6496520	I'm a woman, horse.
6496520	6497520	Okay, horse?
6497520	6500520	Horse, so I can ride the horse.
6500520	6503520	Well, a horse trots up to you out of nowhere.
6503520	6505520	What color is it?
6506520	6507520	What color do you want it to be?
6507520	6508520	Your animal companion?
6508520	6509520	Okay.
6510520	6511520	Holy shit.
6513520	6514520	It's brown.
6514520	6515520	Chocolate.
6515520	6516520	There you go.
6517520	6519520	It approaches you with a knowing look in its eye.
6519520	6521520	It seems to say...
6521520	6522520	My name is Coco.
6522520	6524520	Let's companionate.
6526520	6527520	And that too.
6527520	6529520	She could say it all, or she.
6529520	6532520	Oh, hi, Coco.
6532520	6534520	We nuzzle.
6535520	6536520	I'm so happy.
6536520	6537520	Nice.
6537520	6539520	You can leave me here in this viscera.
6539520	6540520	I'm done.
6541520	6543520	The sky as this world is tinged with purple
6543520	6545520	and swaying orbs of orange light
6545520	6547520	that seem far off bob and weave
6547520	6549520	slightly in the twilight expanse of the sky.
6549520	6551520	Large trees cover all you can see
6551520	6553520	aside from the massive bulk of the afina fish
6553520	6556520	whose body is decimated a wide swath of trees
6556520	6558520	that it must have fell upon.
6558520	6560520	This body of the fish stretches upwards
6560520	6563520	about 20 feet higher than even the tallest of the trees.
6563520	6565520	The split in its side is massive
6565520	6566520	and seems to be a mortal wound.
6566520	6568520	The body is iridescent and blotchy
6568520	6571520	and it seems more like an eel than a true fish.
6571520	6573520	You can see the occasional twitch or stir
6573520	6575520	ripple across its mass.
6575520	6577520	The body stretches onward in both directions.
6577520	6578520	What's happening?
6578520	6579520	What am I not seeing?
6579520	6582520	As far as you can see, and almost certainly fire,
6582520	6585520	this wilderness landscape is very foreign to you
6585520	6587520	and must be on another planet or plain
6587520	6589520	or something along those lines.
6589520	6591520	From far off you can hear the occasional roar
6591520	6592520	of screech of beasts.
6592520	6594520	But then you hear shouting from far off
6594520	6596520	and the sounds of branches and twigs breaking.
6596520	6598520	Two people are approaching.
6598520	6599520	Quickly.
6599520	6600520	Two people.
6600520	6601520	Who goes there?
6601520	6603520	I have sharpie butts a lot.
6603520	6607520	I'm done talking.
6607520	6609520	I'm O'Rein Sedona.
6609520	6612520	I have arrows and I shoot them.
6612520	6614520	They might be friends.
6614520	6615520	That's true.
6615520	6618520	But we're playing this game of presenting ourselves.
6618520	6620520	Oh, you weren't shooting the arrows at them.
6620520	6621520	No, no.
6621520	6623520	I was just saying I have arrows.
6623520	6624520	That was a brief introduction.
6624520	6627520	What the hell did you do to our infinifish?
6627520	6628520	You killed our infinifish.
6628520	6629520	That was our infinifish.
6629520	6630520	Oh, shit.
6630520	6631520	Right.
6631520	6633520	We've raised him since he was a finifish.
6637520	6638520	Since he was a finifish.
6638520	6639520	I'm talking about it.
6642520	6646520	We were stuck inside him and we couldn't get out.
6646520	6648520	Wait, this was your infinifish?
6648520	6649520	No.
6649520	6652520	Not a urine infinifish but an infinifish.
6652520	6654520	You raised the infinish.
6654520	6656520	You know your fish was swallowing people.
6656520	6661520	Yeah, but we were stuck where we are now and that's the only way we could get out.
6661520	6664520	We were transported to a place by a wizard who ended up dying and left us here.
6664520	6666520	The infinifish was our only way out.
6666520	6667520	Oh, who are you?
6667520	6668520	What are you?
6670520	6671520	I'm a rogue.
6671520	6672520	Did you guys come up with names?
6672520	6673520	I got your names right here.
6673520	6674520	Oh, go ahead.
6674520	6676520	The pair introduces themselves.
6677520	6679520	The larger one is a half orc.
6679520	6680520	Perhaps wearing heavy armor.
6680520	6681520	Definitely wearing heavy armor.
6681520	6683520	What am I talking about?
6684520	6686520	Sean pointed at Roy when he said the larger one.
6686520	6688520	Yeah, he's the half orc.
6688520	6689520	We determined it randomly.
6689520	6690520	I thought it was a dice roll.
6690520	6691520	Sean is the half orc?
6691520	6695520	Yeah, a half orc battle cleric by the name of Slab, squat thrust.
6698520	6699520	Wait, that's Roy or Sean?
6699520	6700520	That's Roy.
6700520	6701520	That's me.
6701520	6703520	Sean goes by the name of Stump Junkman.
6704520	6706520	Stump, Stump what?
6706520	6707520	Stump Junkman.
6709520	6711520	Also a star of Gonzo porn.
6712520	6715520	It's a mystery science theater, 3000 reference.
6716520	6717520	All right.
6717520	6718520	I apologize.
6719520	6721520	Well, you guys are standing.
6723520	6728520	Wait, so you guys raised a giant people devouring fish to get off of this planet?
6728520	6729520	Or they're liars.
6730520	6734520	Because there were people on inside that fish that were stuck there forever.
6734520	6736520	I think they might have been improvising.
6736520	6738520	We didn't care about them.
6739520	6742520	Look, our fish was the only way that we could get out from where we were.
6742520	6744520	It's unfortunate that it swallowed you.
6744520	6745520	I do apologize for that.
6745520	6746520	But defend yourselves.
6746520	6747520	You killed our fish.
6747520	6749520	Oh, they're going to fight us.
6749520	6750520	Combat.
6751520	6752520	I have arrows.
6753520	6755520	Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.
6755520	6756520	I'm a coward.
6757520	6763520	I have, I have, I have gotten this far avoiding all the harm.
6763520	6765520	Sharpie, don't sell yourself short.
6765520	6767520	Over the course of this journey, you have changed.
6767520	6769520	You've become stronger.
6769520	6771520	And don't you have a hawk?
6773520	6775520	Hawk, attack their faces.
6776520	6777520	No, no, I'm kidding.
6778520	6783520	I think that they're, they're wanting to attack us and they're, they're bad.
6783520	6784520	Yeah, do you guys want to attack?
6785520	6788520	Well, I'm saying to them, don't, let's not fight.
6789520	6790520	Do they still want to fight?
6791520	6792520	Ask them.
6793520	6794520	Also, audience, do you want something to happen?
6794520	6796520	I command, I command.
6797520	6798520	You like us.
6799520	6800520	We like you?
6800520	6801520	Oh, yeah.
6801520	6803520	Casting his arms about in a magical manner.
6803520	6807520	He casts the spell command while uttering the command like.
6808520	6810520	Pick a target, Roy.
6811520	6813520	That's one of them threes.
6813520	6814520	Thank you.
6815520	6816520	Pick a target.
6817520	6819520	Cast it on Sharpie.
6819520	6820520	Yeah.
6820520	6822520	Sharpie, you feel compelled to like this person.
6823520	6824520	I mean, I already did.
6824520	6826520	Which is weird because he's the one that wants to attack you.
6827520	6828520	I don't know.
6828520	6829520	I still want to attack.
6830520	6831520	There you go.
6831520	6832520	He's liking you.
6832520	6833520	How does that make you feel?
6834520	6835520	Probably liked.
6836520	6837520	This guy's all right.
6838520	6841520	Gentlemen, are you wishing to destroy us?
6842520	6844520	I'm sorry that we're talking about this for so long.
6845520	6847520	Maybe we got up on the wrong foot.
6848520	6849520	So you like us.
6850520	6851520	I'm still unclear.
6851520	6852520	I'm a rogue scoundrel.
6852520	6856520	So if you like my friend by proxy, I like you.
6857520	6858520	All right.
6858520	6862520	Well, what's, what's anything fun to do on this planet?
6863520	6866520	You guys have a camp nearby that you've been staying at.
6867520	6868520	Let's go check out that camp.
6869520	6870520	We check out the camp.
6870520	6871520	I love it.
6871520	6872520	Love this guy over here.
6874520	6876520	You only liked him a couple of seconds ago.
6876520	6877520	It's gone to love.
6878520	6881520	Did he cast Duncan Trussell on you?
6884520	6885520	40 years old.
6885520	6886520	Clock's ticking.
6887520	6890520	Legs kind of turned to love faster than it did when I was 25.
6890520	6891520	All right.
6891520	6893520	We run out to that camp.
6893520	6895520	Do you guys want to take him to your camp?
6895520	6896520	Just to be sure.
6896520	6897520	We will take him to our camp.
6897520	6899520	Soon you're at a small camp.
6899520	6900520	I mount my horse there.
6900520	6902520	I hold her name like she loves it.
6902520	6903520	We ride.
6903520	6905520	Upon that horse you ride.
6905520	6906520	Everyone loves it.
6908520	6910520	Soon you're at a small camp.
6910520	6912520	Large green canvas tents are pitched,
6912520	6914520	and a fire pit has been dug with skewered hunks of meat
6914520	6915520	roasting over the flames.
6915520	6918520	A few rocks have been shaped into comfortable looking chairs.
6919520	6920520	This is our camp.
6920520	6922520	Our camp is your camp.
6922520	6923520	You're welcome here.
6923520	6925520	I sit comfortably in one of the rock chairs.
6925520	6926520	Nice.
6926520	6930520	Would you like some of the meat that we have grilling open over an open fire?
6930520	6931520	It's really roasting.
6931520	6932520	Help yourself.
6932520	6933520	Thank you.
6933520	6934520	It's very nice.
6934520	6936520	This has been a weird day.
6937520	6941520	I have to say, you guys are handling the murder of your pet pretty well.
6942520	6945520	So are you two together, or is there a...
6946520	6947520	Yeah, what's your guys' story?
6947520	6948520	Do you have...
6948520	6950520	Are there other partners for us to meet?
6950520	6953520	Is there a Mrs. Stomp Frump?
6955520	6959520	Our relationship is strictly Plutonic, for all intents and purposes.
6959520	6961520	Is there anyone else on this camp?
6961520	6962520	He said Plutonic.
6962520	6963520	Yeah.
6963520	6964520	That means super gay.
6964520	6965520	That's right.
6965520	6966520	Yeah, yeah.
6966520	6967520	It means that it's alive.
6967520	6969520	I think it's all the way up the butt.
6972520	6973520	Shout out to Penny.
6973520	6975520	He needs to say Plutonic.
6975520	6977520	I've told you that a million times.
6977520	6978520	Oh, they're adorable.
6978520	6980520	I know, I like these guys.
6981520	6982520	Now I like them.
6982520	6984520	You guys made all this furniture?
6985520	6987520	He stands at a new finisher, right?
6988520	6990520	And then we bought it from Ikea.
6990520	6991520	It was beautiful.
6993520	6994520	Tell us.
6995520	6999520	Every person and creature in this land wants something.
6999520	7001520	What do you two long for?
7001520	7002520	What is...
7002520	7004520	In what way is your life compass?
7004520	7006520	I'm so afraid to hear this.
7007520	7012520	Before we get into that, I want to extend the use of our cleaning area,
7012520	7015520	since you have plenty of fish guts all over you.
7015520	7017520	Clean yourself and then we will talk.
7017520	7019520	Oh, there's a little hot tub over here.
7019520	7020520	Thank you.
7020520	7023520	I kind of like the shimmer of the fish viscous,
7023520	7025520	so I'm going to keep it on for a little while.
7025520	7026520	I create water.
7026520	7027520	Nice.
7027520	7028520	What?
7029520	7030520	Oh, what?
7030520	7031520	Hey, everyone does.
7031520	7032520	It's...
7033520	7034520	It's nothing to brag about.
7034520	7036520	That's not a competition.
7038520	7040520	I have good arrows.
7041520	7043520	Fellas, hey, where are we?
7043520	7044520	Do we know where we are?
7044520	7046520	Like, we're on a alien planet.
7046520	7048520	I feel like they're hiding something.
7048520	7051520	This camp, it looks like it must have cost each you $1,000.
7051520	7053520	What do you guys want out of this?
7054520	7057520	Spencer, I creep off.
7057520	7058520	I hide behind Coco.
7058520	7060520	They think that I'm brushing Coco.
7060520	7061520	And then I just...
7061520	7065520	I inch away and I poke around.
7065520	7066520	Do I find anything?
7067520	7069520	You find a dire badger.
7071520	7072520	Cool.
7072520	7075520	Lips pulled back and teeth bared.
7075520	7076520	It charges.
7077520	7081520	I use my power to talk to the animal.
7081520	7082520	You don't know that's happening.
7082520	7083520	She snuck away.
7083520	7084520	Oh.
7084520	7086520	I was talking about a squirrel I saw nearby.
7086520	7088520	A squirrel approaches.
7088520	7094520	I take out one sleep arrow and I fire it at the badger.
7094520	7096520	You fire it at the badger, right,
7096520	7097520	as it's biting you in the leg.
7097520	7101520	You take three damage, but you strike the badger with the arrow
7101520	7103520	and it falls asleep.
7105520	7106520	Still three damage, though.
7106520	7108520	Hey, what the hell's going on over there?
7109520	7110520	Hey, guys.
7110520	7111520	I come limping back.
7112520	7114520	The sleeping badger clenched to your leg.
7114520	7117520	Sometimes I fancy myself a detective.
7118520	7120520	I stirred up a badger.
7120520	7124520	But gentlemen, quirk, sharpie,
7124520	7126520	these men have a dire badger.
7127520	7130520	What kind of people have dire badgers?
7130520	7132520	They live in an alien dimension.
7132520	7135520	Okay, we can't ask you because a spell is cast on you.
7135520	7136520	Yeah, I like them.
7137520	7143520	I cast a level one cause fear on Morraine.
7143520	7144520	This guy is fickle.
7144520	7145520	Titled to will save.
7145520	7147520	So that just means I'm afraid?
7147520	7148520	Yeah, you run screaming.
7148520	7151520	Aha! Aha!
7152520	7154520	I'm sorry about her, guys.
7155520	7158520	It's that time of the harvest.
7159520	7161520	Why don't you go talk to Bob?
7161520	7162520	Go hang out.
7162520	7165520	Have him show you his trailer.
7165520	7166520	I'll cry in the room.
7169520	7170520	I said that as a joke.
7170520	7171520	I'm sorry.
7172520	7174520	You're spilling vodka all over your character.
7174520	7175520	You're spilling vodka all over?
7175520	7177520	No, that's not how insults work.
7177520	7178520	I'm clumsy.
7178520	7179520	Those are brand new sheets.
7179520	7180520	I'm clumsy.
7180520	7181520	I know.
7181520	7182520	I'm sorry, Spencer.
7182520	7184520	I apologize for our badger attacking you.
7184520	7189520	Much like us, it's stranded here in an unfamiliar realm.
7189520	7191520	We are just trying to find our way back home.
7191520	7192520	What is your home?
7194520	7197520	I don't feel comfortable disclosing that information with you.
7198520	7202520	I know I just screamed and ran away, but I do not trust these guys.
7203520	7204520	I like them.
7208520	7210520	Spencer, am I in the area?
7211520	7212520	Let's see.
7213520	7216520	Yeah, you recover from your panic and start to wander back.
7217520	7223520	I asked Slab, I said, you know, man, it's been a long fight in that Infinifish.
7223520	7225520	I could really use a nice back rub.
7226520	7228520	Jeff likes a settlement.
7229520	7231520	I cast Hold Person.
7237520	7238520	You fail your save.
7238520	7239520	You're stricken.
7240520	7241520	You can't move.
7241520	7243520	You feel yourself being held as a person.
7244520	7246520	In a tender way?
7247520	7249520	In a sleep paralysis way.
7250520	7251520	I go to sleep.
7251520	7254520	No, I guess more of just a regular paralysis way.
7256520	7259520	Spencer, I don't trust these two.
7259520	7260520	Do you want to fight them?
7260520	7261520	Yeah.
7261520	7262520	Okay.
7262520	7263520	Yeah, I do.
7263520	7264520	All right.
7264520	7267520	Yeah, I take two arrows.
7269520	7276520	The arrows, I fire at them, and me and Coco scream, adventure!
7277520	7278520	They're fighting it.
7278520	7279520	I'm firing at them.
7279520	7284520	Both of your amiros miss their mark and plant themselves deep within the earth.
7284520	7286520	It's fine because I have Coco.
7287520	7289520	So you're trying to hurt us, are you?
7289520	7290520	No.
7291520	7294520	This whole thing has become like an Andy Dick party.
7295520	7296520	It's just a weird random.
7296520	7298520	People are pitching YouTube commercials.
7300520	7302520	I inflict moderate wounds.
7302520	7303520	All right, on who?
7304520	7305520	Mulray.
7305520	7306520	Oh, damn.
7306520	7311520	Reaching out towards you, he attempts to touch you with his crackling with energy hand.
7311520	7312520	Typical.
7312520	7313520	Very.
7314520	7316520	Was it moderate wounds, you say?
7317520	7318520	Yeah.
7318520	7320520	Just making sure I got the right spell, that's all you guys.
7320520	7321520	Don't worry about it.
7322520	7326520	He touches you lightly on the arm, but you feel intense pain.
7326520	7328520	Do something.
7328520	7330520	Spread throughout your entire body.
7330520	7332520	You take 12 damage.
7334520	7335520	Hey, take it easy, buddy.
7335520	7336520	I like you.
7338520	7339520	What are you doing?
7339520	7340520	You're burning my woman.
7340520	7341520	I'm so just...
7341520	7343520	He's starting to kill your buzz on that.
7343520	7345520	You're not liking him as much as you were.
7346520	7348520	You guys are getting creepy on us.
7348520	7349520	Be honest.
7350520	7352520	Okay, I cure moderate wounds.
7354520	7356520	This guy is all over the shop.
7357520	7359520	He gave me the world's creepiest back rub.
7359520	7362520	Now he's fucking fighting people, curing them.
7362520	7364520	He's like Cleverbot.
7364520	7366520	It's just random.
7366520	7367520	Are you off your medication?
7367520	7369520	I love everyone.
7369520	7371520	You have a weird way of showing it.
7371520	7373520	Mulray is healed to full health.
7373520	7374520	Jesus.
7374520	7378520	I apologize for my friend and my traveling partner.
7378520	7382520	As a sign of good faith, please take one of my two healing potions.
7383520	7384520	Really?
7385520	7386520	Fine.
7386520	7387520	Dude.
7388520	7389520	All right.
7389520	7390520	I'll take it, but also dumb.
7390520	7391520	You have two.
7391520	7392520	You should have given two.
7395520	7398520	With you constantly attacking, I might need to keep one just in case.
7398520	7399520	Guys.
7399520	7401520	I set their lives on fire.
7402520	7403520	The wives.
7404520	7406520	They're handing us potions.
7406520	7408520	I'm just sitting around a fire.
7409520	7410520	Everyone's just...
7410520	7412520	Everybody's lost their minds.
7412520	7413520	That's the worst thing.
7413520	7415520	I'm just trying to open up and get a back rub,
7415520	7417520	and everyone's just getting fucking gun-shitty.
7417520	7419520	People are doing poppers and...
7421520	7424520	I tell everybody about my independent movie that I'm going to make
7424520	7426520	and how great it's going to be and how you should all be in it.
7427520	7429520	I take my sword.
7432520	7433520	And I...
7434520	7436520	I try to hit their throats.
7436520	7437520	What?
7437520	7438520	Jesus Christ!
7438520	7440520	Their meat is no harm.
7440520	7442520	They're not doing anything.
7442520	7444520	I don't trust them.
7444520	7445520	Holy fuck.
7445520	7446520	So is that happening?
7447520	7449520	Guys, she's not with us.
7449520	7450520	She's not with us.
7450520	7452520	You're paralyzed, Cork.
7453520	7454520	Yeah.
7454520	7455520	I'm telling you.
7455520	7456520	Well, they tried to hurt me.
7456520	7458520	There's this badger.
7458520	7459520	I try to slice you through.
7459520	7460520	You came shooting at him with shit.
7460520	7462520	Pick a throat to slice.
7463520	7464520	Slabs.
7464520	7466520	Slab. What's your AC?
7466520	7468520	It should be like around 20.
7468520	7469520	It is 20.
7469520	7470520	Now I feel bad about this.
7470520	7471520	You can do it.
7471520	7472520	Oh, wow.
7472520	7473520	Can I use evasion?
7473520	7475520	You slice your foot open.
7476520	7478520	You're not rolling high tonight.
7478520	7479520	I'm sorry.
7479520	7481520	You take just three damage.
7481520	7483520	That's not bad.
7484520	7486520	You look really embarrassed.
7487520	7489520	You know, things happen.
7489520	7491520	It doesn't even seem like an act of aggression.
7491520	7493520	It just seems like a very confusing
7493520	7495520	and desperate maneuver.
7495520	7496520	I am a woman.
7496520	7497520	I do things.
7497520	7498520	I want to get on my horse.
7498520	7500520	I cure her light wounds.
7500520	7502520	You cure it to full health.
7503520	7506520	I punch myself on the head three times.
7508520	7509520	You do that.
7509520	7511520	You regain control of your body
7511520	7512520	and just enough to punch yourself.
7512520	7513520	I eat a tree.
7516520	7518520	I fuck the sleeping badger.
7518520	7519520	It wakes up.
7521520	7523520	I use my power to talk to the badger.
7524520	7525520	And I say badger.
7525520	7528520	I pulled the badger aside behind one of the roughly
7528520	7530520	human attractive stone chairs.
7530520	7533520	And I go, what the fuck is going on?
7533520	7534520	Spencer.
7534520	7537520	Spencer, horses are intuitive, right?
7537520	7539520	They can tell if someone's a good person or a bad person.
7539520	7540520	I'd say so.
7541520	7544520	I go up to Coco and I say, Coco, baby.
7545520	7546520	Spencer.
7546520	7547520	What's the deal with these two fellows?
7547520	7548520	Are they good or are they bad?
7548520	7550520	Spencer, what are we supposed to look at?
7550520	7551520	What's huh?
7551520	7553520	What are we supposed to be looking for?
7553520	7554520	I can explain it in a second.
7554520	7556520	You just say defer to me.
7556520	7557520	Defer to you.
7557520	7558520	Okay, let me take care of these two actions.
7558520	7559520	What's going on?
7559520	7562520	The badger's like, hey, man, this is like forest land.
7562520	7563520	I don't know what it's called because I'm a badger.
7563520	7566520	I don't name things, but it's like a forest.
7566520	7568520	This whole thing is all forest.
7568520	7569520	All I've seen is forest.
7569520	7571520	Yeah, I mean, but do you know these guys?
7571520	7572520	You hang out with these guys a lot?
7572520	7574520	No, I don't hang out with humans.
7574520	7579520	I live with my animal friends and sometimes we cavort and play,
7579520	7582520	but we don't talk to people unless they can talk to animals,
7582520	7583520	which is odd.
7583520	7584520	Fuck it.
7584520	7585520	I'm going to hang out with you.
7585520	7586520	These guys are freaking me out.
7586520	7589520	All right, cut to the horse.
7589520	7592520	These guys are obviously very confused.
7592520	7593520	They're out of sorts.
7593520	7594520	They're not in their element.
7594520	7596520	They aren't from here, so.
7596520	7599520	But Coco, baby, are they evil?
7599520	7601520	I can't say if they're evil.
7601520	7605520	They don't seem evil, but they do seem jumpy and a frame.
7605520	7606520	Coco.
7606520	7607520	Easily agitatable.
7607520	7608520	All right.
7608520	7609520	Whatever you say is perfect.
7609520	7610520	All right.
7610520	7616520	Cut to the two adventurers whose camp you're in starting a lengthy monologue.
7616520	7618520	Maybe not so lengthy.
7618520	7619520	One would hope.
7619520	7620520	We're actually.
7620520	7621520	So.
7621520	7623520	We've been searching for this thing.
7623520	7625520	It's called the soul of growth.
7625520	7628520	You know, the soul of growth is what birthed the world tree.
7628520	7632520	And the world tree created the entire plane of vibrance.
7632520	7636520	And from that came the material plane and all the plant life in it.
7636520	7638520	And it's a very powerful thing.
7638520	7640520	It's supposed to be here.
7640520	7647520	Like I said before, that wizard dude, he teleported us here, but he got eaten by a dire wolverine.
7647520	7648520	It wasn't fun.
7648520	7650520	Are you saying this?
7650520	7651520	These guys are saying it.
7651520	7652520	I have it written down.
7652520	7656520	Well, I'm not looking at it written down, but I have it written down somewhere.
7656520	7657520	You guys.
7657520	7661520	So I command Sharpie to help us find the whatever the hell.
7661520	7664520	You're going to have to cut it down to a one word answer.
7664520	7665520	Oh, okay.
7665520	7666520	One.
7666520	7667520	And like help.
7667520	7668520	How.
7668520	7670520	Of course.
7670520	7673520	Well, it fails to affect him, unfortunately.
7673520	7674520	Damn it.
7674520	7677520	You were told to help, but you don't necessarily feel compelled to.
7677520	7680520	What kind of game are you trying to run me, man?
7680520	7685520	Can I use my skill of diplomacy to try to aid have them aid us in our quest?
7685520	7690520	Is your skill of explain a sea?
7690520	7691520	Yeah, ma'am.
7691520	7692520	Okay.
7692520	7693520	This is the soul of the soul of growth.
7693520	7695520	Just explained it.
7695520	7696520	Looking for it.
7696520	7697520	Sorry.
7697520	7698520	Sorry.
7698520	7699520	We got trapped on this plane.
7699520	7700520	Now we don't know where the fuck to go.
7700520	7702520	You know, let's go find the soul of growth.
7702520	7703520	All right.
7703520	7704520	We would appreciate your help.
7704520	7706520	And in turn, we will help you on whatever quest we're on.
7706520	7709520	We'd love to remember that crazy girl who looked just like me, who was trying to kill
7709520	7710520	you.
7710520	7711520	She was the worst.
7711520	7712520	She left.
7712520	7713520	I'm here.
7714520	7716520	I give bull strength to Maureen.
7722520	7724520	Your strength increases by five.
7724520	7725520	Thank you.
7725520	7726520	Thank you, Roy.
7726520	7727520	You're welcome.
7728520	7730520	Shout out to Penner.
7730520	7731520	That's right.
7731520	7734520	I jump on my horse.
7734520	7735520	Actually, I'm just kidding.
7735520	7738520	Penny, if you listen to this, that's a joke.
7738520	7741520	Can I inquire as to what your quest is?
7741520	7742520	What are you doing out here?
7742520	7745520	I'm just hanging out with these two fuckers.
7745520	7748520	Things have gone pretty wild for a while.
7748520	7751520	We want adventure and fortune, right?
7751520	7753520	Also, my dad is getting killed.
7754520	7757520	I like the sound of the soul of growth thing.
7757520	7762520	It sounds like maybe we're going to find something bigger than just, you know, fortune.
7762520	7765520	Maybe our souls can prosper through this.
7765520	7766520	We can grow as people.
7766520	7767520	Sounds great.
7767520	7771520	Gentlemen, new friends, would you like to ride on my horse with me?
7772520	7773520	Yeah.
7775520	7776520	Come on, Coco.
7776520	7777520	This doesn't look a good idea.
7777520	7778520	She loves that.
7778520	7779520	Everyone get on.
7779520	7780520	I'm really afraid of...
7784520	7785520	Horses.
7785520	7786520	Yeah.
7787520	7789520	Has everybody got fucking mushrooms up here?
7790520	7792520	I thought it was just me.
7792520	7795520	You know, he has a talking dagger.
7795520	7796520	That's true.
7796520	7797520	I have a talking dagger.
7797520	7798520	What's up?
7798520	7799520	Yeah.
7800520	7802520	Are you interested in that?
7802520	7803520	Not yet.
7803520	7804520	Are you sure?
7804520	7805520	Yeah.
7805520	7806520	All right.
7806520	7807520	What?
7809520	7810520	Well, that's going to steal your talking dagger.
7810520	7812520	The world's worst murder mystery.
7812520	7813520	Hang on.
7813520	7815520	Well, we'll leave that out of those.
7815520	7819520	I'm Madame McRae, and I run New Orleans.
7821520	7822520	You run New Orleans?
7822520	7823520	No, I run New Orleans.
7823520	7825520	Let's get some more ice.
7826520	7828520	I'm pretty sure these guys are going to try to rape and kill us
7828520	7830520	in the road in the Soul of Growth.
7831520	7835520	I caught a divine favor on...
7836520	7837520	It's Quark.
7837520	7838520	We can be on first.
7838520	7839520	Quark.
7839520	7840520	Whatever.
7840520	7841520	Quark.
7841520	7843520	You were granted a divine favor.
7843520	7845520	You get the sense that if you attacked something,
7845520	7846520	you'd do a better job of it,
7846520	7849520	as if you had the favor of the divine gods.
7850520	7851520	That's right.
7852520	7854520	He's just going down his sheep.
7855520	7856520	Casting everything.
7856520	7859520	If you were a fucking wizard, you'd do that shit, too.
7859520	7860520	I am a wizard.
7860520	7861520	Well, then do that.
7861520	7862520	It's fun.
7862520	7863520	Well, I'm fine.
7863520	7865520	Help I know him out over here.
7865520	7867520	I'm the one with the check marks by him.
7867520	7868520	I cast...
7868520	7872520	I could inflict a whole shitload of wounds on you guys.
7872520	7874520	I cast Mage Hand.
7874520	7876520	You get the ability to teleport her.
7876520	7877520	I mean, sorry.
7877520	7878520	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7879520	7880520	Yeah, sir.
7880520	7882520	I use it to lift a rock.
7882520	7883520	Oh, shit.
7884520	7885520	Oh, uh...
7886520	7887520	Yeah.
7888520	7889520	Okay, now I...
7889520	7890520	I use...
7890520	7892520	I cast Ray of Frost on the rock.
7892520	7895520	It is covered in a thin sheet of ice.
7895520	7897520	Oh, yeah.
7897520	7898520	I use...
7898520	7901520	No, I cast Burning Hands on the frozen rock.
7903520	7904520	It cracks in half.
7907520	7909520	Let's fucking do this shit, bro.
7910520	7914520	The powers you've demonstrated can aid us on our quest, please.
7914520	7915520	Not in one.
7915520	7916520	I used them.
7917520	7918520	I have to recharge.
7918520	7919520	I use Stone...
7919520	7920520	I need a bowl of cereal and a...
7920520	7924520	I use Stone Shape to make a puppy.
7925520	7929520	The stone chair shapes shifts into the shape of an adorable puppy.
7930520	7933520	I cast Hypnotism on the puppy.
7934520	7936520	The puppy, though shaped like a stone...
7936520	7939520	I mean, though shaped like a puppy is but a stone.
7939520	7942520	I take two arrows and I shoot them at the necks of the strangers
7942520	7944520	because I realize I don't trust them.
7946520	7947520	Jesus Christ.
7947520	7948520	You cannot...
7948520	7950520	One of them strikes directly into the throat.
7950520	7951520	Well, pick guys.
7951520	7952520	Are you doing each?
7954520	7955520	I don't...
7955520	7956520	How many times have they healed you now?
7958520	7960520	It's like you don't want to be loved.
7962520	7963520	But they're not...
7963520	7965520	They're not open about who they are.
7965520	7967520	It's disconcerting.
7967520	7969520	We're so open as to who we are.
7969520	7971520	You just told them you were somebody else earlier
7971520	7972520	when you were behaving like an asshole
7972520	7975520	and then shot them in the neck with an arrow.
7975520	7976520	That was not me.
7976520	7979520	I use my skill of listen to hear what Mulrain has to say.
7979520	7980520	Damn.
7981520	7982520	I use my skill...
7982520	7983520	I use my...
7983520	7984520	Hey, Slab.
7985520	7988520	I use level three to cure serious wounds.
7989520	7991520	You'll cure your neck wound.
7991520	7992520	I cast Jump.
7992520	7994520	I'm going to jump just up in the air
7994520	7996520	like Jack Nicholson and Wolf.
7996520	7999520	Just James Spader just jump around.
7999520	8001520	I'm just going to jump around.
8001520	8003520	I eat 14 arrows.
8004520	8006520	You get indigestion.
8008520	8011520	I march off alone in search of the soul of growth.
8011520	8013520	I would like to tag along with Quorum
8013520	8015520	and explore the world.
8015520	8016520	Fuck you.
8016520	8019520	Anybody that wants to come along can come.
8019520	8022520	But let's fucking set some ground rules here.
8022520	8023520	I'm going with that guy.
8023520	8025520	Let's be friends and let's fight.
8025520	8028520	Let's fucking put your dick back in your pants
8028520	8029520	or take it out.
8029520	8031520	Don't create water all over each other.
8031520	8033520	You're a bunch of fucking nut jobs.
8034520	8036520	I've been standing around here and it's fucking crazy.
8036520	8037520	I'm leaving.
8038520	8040520	You guys stay here and fucking punch each other
8040520	8043520	and kiss each other and freeze rocks.
8043520	8045520	I'm trying to grow as a person.
8046520	8049520	I joined him in magic vestment.
8049520	8050520	Nice.
8050520	8051520	Thank you.
8051520	8052520	I'll take it later.
8053520	8055520	As you leave, you feel your armor grow stronger.
8055520	8056520	I appreciate that.
8056520	8058520	Whatever your name is, I'm leaving.
8058520	8062520	Trot trot trot trot trot trot trot trot.
8062520	8063520	I go running behind court.
8063520	8064520	Oh shit.
8064520	8065520	Come on.
8065520	8066520	Please wait.
8066520	8068520	You guys want to go east, west, or south.
8068520	8070520	East or west or along the side of the fish
8070520	8072520	and south is away from it.
8072520	8073520	South.
8073520	8074520	South.
8075520	8076520	All right.
8076520	8077520	That's a good direction.
8077520	8078520	Everybody's coming?
8078520	8079520	Yeah.
8079520	8081520	I really could have used 10 minutes alone, but fine.
8081520	8082520	Cliffhanger.
8082520	8083520	Cliffhanger.
8083520	8085520	That's the end of it.
8085520	8087520	That's all we have to say for it.
8087520	8089520	Let's have a Ryan John, everybody.
8089520	8091520	Holy moly.
8092520	8094520	First time D&D players, guys.
8094520	8095520	Hey, we all are.
8095520	8097520	No, I don't think they did anything wrong.
8097520	8098520	No, no.
8098520	8099520	That was terrific.
8099520	8102520	I enjoyed myself and that's what matters.
8103520	8106520	It's not like I ever had an expert D&D player.
8106520	8108520	It's not like just me.
8108520	8110520	What would that be like?
8110520	8111520	That was great.
8111520	8115520	It was like going to the weirdest bisexual bar
8115520	8117520	in the middle of nowhere.
8117520	8120520	It was like so many encounters we had on the road, remember?
8120520	8122520	Like you'd go to like Rhode Island
8122520	8124520	and then somebody would buy you a drink and you didn't know.
8124520	8125520	Yeah.
8125520	8127520	That was like no encounters that I had on the road.
8127520	8129520	Where were you, Jeff?
8129520	8130520	I was alone.
8131520	8132520	You were out there.
8132520	8134520	After every show Dan stood out there.
8134520	8137520	I say this only so that you have to do it tonight as well.
8137520	8141520	Dan stood and signed everybody's shit after the show.
8141520	8142520	But this is too big a crowd.
8142520	8144520	You can't do it tonight, can you?
8144520	8145520	Well, they probably don't need you.
8145520	8146520	They're in Los Angeles.
8146520	8147520	But I would do it anyway.
8147520	8150520	I'm very proud of the fact that I'm not proud of myself
8150520	8152520	for shaking everyone's hand and signing their shit.
8152520	8154520	That would be a dumb thing to be proud of
8154520	8155520	because it's not an accomplishment.
8155520	8157520	I'm like, oh boy, that's so hard.
8157520	8158520	It's like digging a ditch.
8158520	8159520	You showed great interest in them.
8159520	8160520	You became very fascinated.
8160520	8162520	What I was proud of is the fact that I didn't.
8162520	8164520	My instinct wasn't to go fuck yourself.
8164520	8165520	I'm tired.
8165520	8168520	My instinct, I'm proud of that.
8168520	8171520	I remember when I was walking across the street
8171520	8173520	with Sean McKenna in Milwaukee
8173520	8176520	and a motorcycle rider had his horrible wreck
8176520	8179520	and his leg flew off and I was running down to him
8179520	8181520	and I tripped over his leg and I was like,
8181520	8182520	oh shit, his leg's gone.
8182520	8184520	And I was proud of the fact that I didn't like...
8184520	8186520	I would always think on paper if you said,
8186520	8190520	oh, you're gonna interact with a guy who lost his leg
8190520	8192520	that I would go, oh, I'll probably faint
8192520	8194520	and I won't be able to help him.
8194520	8195520	And I didn't help him, he died.
8195520	8196520	But...
8200520	8204520	Do you want truth or do you want a story?
8206520	8207520	We want a story.
8207520	8209520	A true story, preferably.
8209520	8211520	He died a million years later.
8211520	8213520	He lived a full life.
8213520	8214520	He had eight children.
8217520	8219520	He didn't die there on the sidewalk,
8219520	8221520	but I found out later that he died.
8221520	8225520	But the point is that I didn't faint and become useless.
8225520	8228520	I said, hey man, you okay?
8228520	8232520	Called 911 and put a blanket under his head
8232520	8234520	because that's what heroes do.
8235520	8236520	I would say on the road,
8236520	8239520	Dan and I were both kind of concerned in the beginning
8239520	8240520	that we would go off on the road
8240520	8243520	and leave our little nest at Meltdown Comics
8243520	8245520	and wonder whether or not the crowds that would come
8245520	8247520	in Phoenix or Austin or Nashville or wherever
8247520	8249520	would get it or dig it or whatever.
8249520	8251520	And what we found out was that it was really safe
8251520	8252520	and really cool.
8252520	8255520	And it's for me, I'm so happy to be back
8255520	8257520	and just go back into Meltdown Comics
8257520	8261520	and our 50 loyalists come in there every time.
8261520	8262520	The cool thing about being back,
8262520	8264520	this is the one thing that I learned.
8264520	8265520	I don't know if I changed,
8265520	8270520	but I was sitting in the back of a comic book store.
8270520	8271520	We were doing the show.
8271520	8272520	We were going to keep doing that every week
8272520	8273520	because that's like therapy for me.
8273520	8274520	50 people show up.
8274520	8277520	That's a weird thing to cheer,
8277520	8280520	and I also don't want to punish you for cheering.
8280520	8283520	I just want to make you self-conscious about it.
8286520	8287520	Obviously, keep doing that.
8287520	8289520	I was always happy to do that,
8289520	8291520	but there was a voice in the back of my head going,
8291520	8295520	like, oh, is this, are you regressing
8295520	8298520	into a cradle of comfort that's ever diminishing?
8298520	8301520	Is your world getting smaller and smaller
8301520	8303520	and smaller by sitting in the back
8303520	8305520	doing this ersatz Spalding Grey routine,
8305520	8308520	or are you just like shrinking,
8308520	8311520	shrinking and shrinking into less and less of a person
8311520	8313520	and just talking to the only people left
8313520	8315520	that'll ever listen to you?
8315520	8318520	So I think that urge is like, get out there,
8318520	8322520	go try this bullshit in Phoenix and see if it plays,
8322520	8324520	see if someone throws pudding at your face.
8324520	8328520	And then all this shit, like Patton Oswalt came up
8328520	8331520	and he warned us very justifiably.
8331520	8333520	He was like, holy shit, you're going to Phoenix.
8333520	8335520	It's going to be all fucked up.
8335520	8338520	The podcast culture is such that what's happened is,
8338520	8341520	in every city in the entire world,
8341520	8346520	you can find 100 or more of the people
8346520	8348520	that you would want to hang out with.
8348520	8351520	So every city that we went to, it was all the same.
8351520	8352520	It was really odd.
8352520	8354520	They weren't wearing different hats.
8354520	8357520	I'm from Austin, so it's a cowboy hat.
8357520	8359520	They were just the same people.
8359520	8362520	I'm not saying it's to be kiss-ass or to blow smoke,
8362520	8365520	but it was amazing and really reassuring
8365520	8367520	was that the people that we meet are the same people
8367520	8370520	that we fell in love with here for our show.
8370520	8374520	It's that incredibly creative people come to the show.
8374520	8377520	People kept all the artwork and the gifts
8377520	8378520	and the conversation.
8378520	8380520	Yeah, they make you a napkin or a hat.
8380520	8382520	A napkin's not that part of it.
8382520	8386520	It's a very cool, powerfully creative.
8386520	8387520	They're all writers.
8387520	8390520	There's got to be more writers per capita
8390520	8393520	in a harm in town audience than anything.
8393520	8395520	How many writers are out there tonight?
8395520	8398520	So, yeah.
8398520	8403520	They're not a group of people that likes to applaud themselves,
8403520	8405520	but we'll go with cockroach rules
8405520	8408520	and assume that means most of you.
8408520	8412520	50 people clap, so there's 150 writers out there.
8412520	8415520	For everyone you see, Jeff, and they're born pregnant.
8415520	8421520	But the cool thing is coming back,
8421520	8424520	I feel like doing those shows in the back of Meltdown
8424520	8426520	where we're going to continue to do them,
8426520	8430520	I do feel like, okay, having gone to 20 cities in 23 days,
8430520	8435520	what we learned is, no, it's not necessarily an unhealthy thing I'm doing.
8435520	8441520	I am talking to people that are all out there.
8441520	8445520	And everybody that came up to me and talked to me at all of these shows,
8445520	8447520	they all had that thing in common.
8447520	8455520	It was like, all these little nerds that we don't fit in,
8455520	8459520	but there's nerds that turn that into anger
8459520	8463520	and go like, well, I'm going to fucking kill and murder everybody
8463520	8467520	because I'm a nerd and I'm going to fucking strangle them and show them what's what.
8467520	8469520	And then there's nerds that are like,
8469520	8472520	God damn it, I just want people to like me.
8472520	8476520	And I want to like them, I want to understand them.
8476520	8481520	All these lines, like 5,000 people I think I probably shook hands with and talked to,
8481520	8483520	and it was all the same.
8483520	8485520	Some of them can't make eye contact,
8485520	8487520	and most of them can't make eye contact,
8487520	8490520	and I can't make eye contact.
8490520	8493520	I know you get this all the time, and I'm like,
8493520	8495520	I really like it.
8495520	8498520	You don't have to tell me that, I'm just Dan Harmon.
8499520	8501520	Can I get a picture?
8501520	8503520	Yeah, everyone can take a picture.
8509520	8511520	I had this conversation with Spencer on the bus,
8511520	8512520	and the camera crews weren't there.
8512520	8514520	The director will blow his brains out when he hears about this.
8514520	8515520	Yeah, it was good.
8515520	8517520	Everyone was sleeping.
8517520	8518520	The camera crew was sleeping.
8518520	8521520	It was the most important scene in the documentary that will never be seen.
8521520	8522520	Everyone was sleeping.
8522520	8525520	Everyone in the aliens' ship was in hypersleep,
8525520	8528520	and I woke up mysteriously.
8528520	8532520	The bus wasn't moving, and the oil was getting changed,
8532520	8533520	and I walked out.
8533520	8535520	We were in the middle of the space station.
8535520	8538520	I walked randomly into this little thing,
8538520	8541520	and Spencer was sitting there looking unexpectedly,
8541520	8543520	like perfectly at home in a truck stop.
8543520	8546520	When you actually look at him, it looks like...
8546520	8550520	If you saw him in a truck stop, you would not look twice.
8550520	8551520	Little do you know, yeah.
8552520	8555520	Spencer and I just talked for a while,
8555520	8557520	and we talked about autographs.
8557520	8558520	We talked about pictures.
8558520	8560520	We talked about weird things.
8560520	8562520	Spencer's half my age.
8562520	8564520	I thought it was a very interesting conversation
8564520	8567520	because you and I were talking to each other about
8567520	8572520	why do people put importance on these things?
8572520	8575520	What is it about autographs, souvenirs, photographs,
8575520	8577520	all these rituals that we engage in?
8577520	8579520	They celebrate specialness.
8579520	8581520	Oh, shit, Bill Murray's in an elevator.
8581520	8582520	I'll get a lock of his hair.
8582520	8584520	I'll have him sign a thing, or I'll say something shitty to him.
8584520	8586520	I have a story to tell my friends.
8586520	8589520	You have this urge to make this moment special.
8589520	8591520	I was explaining to you,
8591520	8594520	well, I think people, yeah, that's what we have,
8594520	8596520	this urge to make this moment special.
8596520	8597520	I feel like you...
8597520	8599520	I don't want to put words into your mouth,
8599520	8600520	but at one point you were like,
8600520	8605520	so you want to understand them about normal people.
8605520	8612520	You were like, so you actually want to know how they think.
8612520	8617520	I was like, yeah, I'm obsessed with that.
8617520	8621520	I think that when you don't fit in,
8621520	8624520	you can react one of two different ways to that.
8624520	8628520	I had that conversation with you and I don't know.
8628520	8629520	I know it was important,
8629520	8631520	but I have no idea what the final verdict was
8631520	8633520	or anything like that.
8633520	8635520	I know that you were affected by this journey,
8635520	8639520	and I hope the movie's good,
8639520	8643520	and I hope that me battling will create some kind of...
8650520	8652520	I hope I can improvise an ending of the movie.
8652520	8655520	Also, I think I was told there's going to be some visuals
8655520	8657520	to go along with it, too.
8657520	8658520	Oh, damn.
8658520	8660520	I'm supposed to point at the projectionist.
8663520	8666520	Oh, shit.
8666520	8669520	We're not even going to be performing. Let's just watch.
8669520	8673520	I mean, Dan, you can sing along. I'm digging around, too.
8674520	8677520	Across the country.
8677520	8680520	Your mama's hunting.
8680520	8683520	Sorry. Sorry. I'm starting over.
8685520	8687520	All right. Here we go.
8688520	8691520	Harmontown.
8691520	8693520	Harmontown.
8693520	8697520	The movie is yellow and the globe is brown.
8697520	8700520	I fucked your mama. I thought she was upside down.
8700520	8703520	Some people call me Pringles dick,
8703520	8706520	but I never really found out why.
8707520	8710520	I don't really have a Pringles dick.
8710520	8713520	I just keep my dick inside.
8714520	8716520	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can
8716520	8719520	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
8719520	8721520	Harmontown.
8721520	8723520	Some people call me Pringles dick,
8723520	8725520	but I never really found out.
8725520	8727520	No, I never found out.
8727520	8730520	I never really found out why.
8733520	8735520	We lost them.
8735520	8737520	Here I am.
8737520	8739520	Ain't got a dick.
8739520	8741520	Ain't got a chicken noodle can.
8741520	8742520	I know it. Sing it.
