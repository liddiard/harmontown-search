87000	89000	Thanks, guys.
89000	92000	Do I just knock now, or should I bring out the asshole?

95000	97000	Okay, let's talk a little bit.
97000	98000	Okay.
98000	100000	How's your back?
100000	102000	Oh, I can't hear you, man. It's bad.
102000	103000	You can't hear me?
103000	104000	No, it's bad.
104000	106000	Oh, man, you should have a sound check.
106000	110000	All right, yeah, well, let's just bring Dan Harbin out here!
113000	116000	Thank you!
116000	118000	Hello!
118000	120000	Wow!
120000	122000	Holy shit!
122000	124000	Amazing!
126000	128000	Thank you!
130000	132000	Ridiculous!
132000	134000	Yeah, now it's gonna...
134000	136000	The stakes are way too high.
136000	138000	Can you hear me?
138000	139000	Can you hear me?
139000	140000	Yeah, I can hear you.
140000	141000	Okay, and you're okay?
141000	142000	Without the music, it's a little bit...
142000	143000	Without the music, okay, good.
143000	144000	No, I think we're gonna be okay.
144000	147000	Well, we're gonna be great.
147000	152000	This is gonna be the best show that Harmontown has ever had.
156000	162000	I feel that mandate in the attendance, and then, I mean, that's the...
162000	165000	You know, it's called the Windy City, Dino.
165000	167000	It's the second Windy City.
167000	170000	And it's because of the love.
170000	172000	The love and the blowing and the...
172000	175000	I heard it was called the Windy City because of political corruption.
175000	178000	Yeah, fuck that!
178000	179000	Fuck that!
179000	184000	I saw a big metal umbrella, like, wash across like...
184000	187000	Yeah, there's like glass falling on people's heads.
187000	188000	No, it's in San...
188000	189000	It's windy here!
189000	190000	Yeah, yeah.
190000	192000	Stop being ironic!
192000	195000	Yeah, who knows politics?
196000	197000	You guys love Chicago?
197000	199000	You love being in Chicago?
199000	201000	Do you have pride?
201000	202000	Do you have pride?
202000	204000	That's good.
204000	207000	This is my sort of hometown away from hometown.
207000	208000	Mine, too.
208000	210000	I grew up in Milwaukee.
210000	212000	Although it is my hometown.
212000	215000	It's actually my hometown.
215000	216000	Chicago is.
216000	221000	Yeah, but I like New York more.
221000	223000	I mean, I'm still figuring it out.
223000	224000	I don't get it.
224000	227000	You get into the airport, you know it's very cloying.
227000	230000	You know that your civic pride is like...
230000	233000	There's a lot of mustard being put on it.
233000	235000	Or have you not expected...
235000	238000	Anytime someone from Chicago leaves Chicago,
238000	240000	when you come back to O'Hare,
240000	244000	do you see the effect you're having on people?
244000	250000	With your elevator buttons or baseball teams?
250000	252000	It's really cloying.
252000	255000	Like, whoa, you have 90 Chicago things.
255000	258000	Yeah, we have a million sports that we...
258000	260000	There's a million sports teams here.
260000	261000	That's all I know.
261000	263000	I just feel from the moment I get here
263000	265000	like I'm going to get the shit kicked out of it.
265000	266000	Well, you know hot dogs.
266000	267000	You know hot dogs.
267000	268000	You know pizza.
268000	269000	You know wind.
269000	270000	You know second city.
270000	273000	It's also good to have a city be famous for a hot dog.
273000	275000	Because really, that's great.
275000	278000	That's always a great sign that you're doing...
278000	280000	It's not famous for the hot dogs.
280000	281000	It's not famous for the hot dogs.
281000	286000	Literally, the hot dog is a unit of measure of banality and food.
286000	289000	That's the whole point of a hot dog.
289000	297000	It's ground pig shoved into a pig intestine on a bun.
297000	300000	I know you know what a hot dog is.
300000	302000	To be famous for it.
302000	304000	Can I please interrupt?
304000	305000	It's not famous for the hot dog.
305000	309000	It's famous for the stupid salad on top of it.
309000	310000	What's up, bummer man?
310000	315000	I hate hot dogs that have anything more on them that makes them hard to hold and stuff.
315000	316000	Jesus Christ.
316000	318000	Yeah, but you're a fucking, you're high.
318000	321000	I can't be holding all this stuff.
321000	322000	How do you hold this thing?
322000	323000	It's falling everywhere.
323000	326000	It's an avalanche of vegetables.
326000	331000	But all hot dog places that aren't shitty, that's what they do.
331000	334000	They're like, let's put a mountain of garbage on a hot dog.
334000	335000	It's just dumb, man.
335000	336000	It's a hot dog.
336000	338000	They're supposed to be terrible.
338000	344000	And we were at a hot dog place and they didn't, they take your order.
344000	345000	I wrote this down.
345000	347000	Your order is your name.
347000	348000	No, it's not.
348000	351000	The guy shouted out hot dog everything.
351000	354000	That's half the people in the fucking place.
354000	356000	What do you mean hot dog everything?
356000	358000	That's not specific.
358000	359000	That's what I meant.
359000	361000	You Chicagoans.
361000	364000	He's got a million of these.
365000	366000	All right.
366000	369000	Now, next, really, I'm holding you to task.
369000	372000	You're panhandlers.
372000	373000	They're pushing.
373000	376000	You're panhandlers and you're black.
376000	382000	They've got to be, you have to have the worst, most, I just, that's the only thing that you
382000	387000	get to taste of a city by running across it is it's panhandlery.
387000	394000	And, like, you're guys, like, they're terrible, terrible people.
394000	396000	They don't even know.
396000	398000	They're bad at panhandling.
398000	400000	They're not making any money.
400000	403000	They're doing insane things.
403000	411000	I don't want to get fucking really, really crass and dark about this, but I'm a Milwaukeean
411000	413000	and that city is colder than Chicago.
413000	417000	And I know because somebody said, why?
417000	421000	Why are the panhandlers so bad at panhandling?
421000	426000	And I said, the turnover is higher.
426000	429000	The winters kill.
429000	434000	And it's not, I'm not trying to, it's fucking horrible.
434000	436000	It's like we need to wake up to our class system.
436000	438000	Like, it's true.
438000	442000	There's a night in Milwaukee that's, like, it's got some crazy German name, like, you
442000	446000	know, homeless notter or something.
446000	453000	Where the car break-ins go through the roof because our homeless population is just freezing
453000	456000	off like mosquitoes.
456000	458000	It's fucking horrible.
458000	460000	I mean, it's dark.
460000	462000	I'm saying it's dark.
462000	468000	And I know Chicago is Milwaukee's cousin, so I know there was a woman, I keep conflating
468000	470000	homeless with panhandling.
470000	472000	I mean, some of these people probably have one bedroom apartments.
472000	475000	Not that I'm PJ O'Rourke, I'm not doing that thing.
475000	482000	I'm just saying, like, there was a woman sitting, and I wrote it down, and she was saying it
482000	484000	on a loop.
484000	490000	She was like a 25-year-old woman sitting on the sidewalk, and she was saying, this is
490000	495000	my impression of her voice, she said, I need a dollar, can anyone help me out?
495000	497000	I need a dollar, can anyone help me out?
497000	499000	I need a dollar, can anyone help me out?
499000	501000	I need a dollar.
501000	503000	That's what she was doing.
503000	505000	Right, yeah, but you didn't look close enough.
505000	507000	She was actually giving birth at the time.
507000	509000	Nothing makes her a hero.
509000	511000	Nothing.
511000	513000	I don't care.
513000	515000	She's nothing.
515000	517000	That's the wrong way to do everything.
517000	525000	And then there was another guy, as I came out of the hotel, he bumped into me and he said,
525000	527000	can I have $15?
528000	535000	Which my girlfriend pointed out, she said, when panhandling steaks get that high, that's
535000	537000	robbery.
537000	545000	Asking someone can I have $15 is pretty close to mugging them.
545000	548000	Asking for $15 is telling you give me $10.
548000	551000	Yeah, well, no, he's a cosmetic figure for sure.
551000	555000	He had read the right books, but all right.
555000	562000	Remember that one panhandler who we walked by and he said, sarcastically, anything will
562000	564000	do.
564000	566000	Right, yeah.
566000	568000	He was a bum.
568000	573000	Your poor people should be ashamed of themselves, is our point.
573000	575000	Have better homeless.
575000	580000	The next time I come back here, your impoverished had better...
580000	582000	Be a little more impoverished.
582000	588000	I am sick and tired of being asked for money in those certain ways.
588000	591000	In L.A., the homeless people, they own the streets.
591000	597000	They set up camp, they have barbecues, they block off city streets and are just wandering
597000	599000	around having a great time.
599000	601000	They're the worst.
601000	603000	They got to figure it out in L.A., man.
603000	605000	It's good.
605000	607000	Oh, no, yeah.
607000	608000	They got tents.
608000	610000	And the winter doesn't kill you.
610000	612000	Yeah.
612000	614000	That's why there's so many.
614000	616000	They pile up.
616000	618000	You could be...
618000	620000	They don't die off.
620000	622000	I mean, it's not...
622000	624000	Yeah.
624000	626000	I love this.
626000	628000	Who looks more like three homeless guys than us right now?
628000	639000	Even in my Jeff Davis suit, I look homeless.
639000	641000	Yeah.
641000	645000	I mean, the truth is, it's going to be a terrible show tonight, folks.
645000	660000	I didn't say nigger yet.
660000	665000	Don't approve and not...
665000	669000	Moving on because I don't approve.
669000	672000	Speaking of getting stabbed...
672000	674000	Oh, shit.
674000	676000	My dad lives in Columbia.
676000	678000	I was going to ask you about that.
678000	684000	Yeah, he lives in Columbia, and the last time he was in L.A., he got stabbed.
684000	686000	When was this?
686000	688000	New Year's Eve.
688000	691000	I think he was trying to shoot a documentary about his...
691000	693000	I don't know. It's dumb.
693000	695000	Is he all right?
695000	697000	Yeah, no, he got stabbed in the face.
697000	699000	Oh, fuck.
699000	701000	Wait, was he good looking?
701000	702000	What?
702000	703000	Is he good looking?
703000	704000	Well, he wasn't before that.
704000	705000	Well, then it's fine.
705000	707000	That was the best place to get stabbed.
707000	708000	It's all good.
708000	711000	Yeah, no, it was New Year's Eve, and he was like, I don't know.
711000	714000	My dad, he has all these crazy stories that I never thought were true
714000	716000	and he just seemed like, why would you say that to anybody
716000	719000	unless you're just trying to look cool in front of the person you're insulting?
719000	723000	But he gets like, he was living in Columbia, and he was talking about one time
723000	726000	this guy was trying to mug him, and my dad wasn't having that,
726000	729000	and he told the guy to go fuck himself, and the guy pulled out a knife,
729000	731000	and my dad was like, what?
731000	735000	And took a step towards him, and then the guy was going to mess around with him,
735000	738000	but then he just walked away, and I was like, that's a lie.
738000	739000	So my dad does...
739000	740000	Lies?
740000	741000	I don't know.
741000	743000	He sounded like a lie until he got stabbed.
743000	744000	Like, that's the thing.
744000	747000	He does all these things that it's like, why would you do that
747000	749000	unless you wanted to get stabbed?
749000	751000	And then well, lo and behold.
751000	753000	But no, New Year's Eve...
753000	757000	Are you saying that your dad had a, I didn't get stabbed in the face
757000	760000	even though I tried really hard two stories
760000	764000	before he had a I got stabbed in the face story?
764000	768000	My whole childhood was multiple I should have got stabbed in the face stories.
768000	770000	I would tell him, like, why didn't you get stabbed in the face, dad?
770000	773000	And you're saying you thought your dad was a pathological liar,
773000	777000	but now you're learning that he's a pathological stab seeker.
777000	778000	Yeah.
778000	784000	But he was the most honest person who really wants to get stabbed in the face.
784000	785000	And he found out.
785000	786000	That's kind of amazing.
786000	787000	Yeah, yeah.
787000	789000	I wish we could get your dad up here right now.
789000	790000	I know.
790000	791000	It would be great.
791000	792000	He looks horrible, though.
792000	793000	It's terrible.
793000	795000	Oh, you saw a picture of him with the stab marks?
795000	797000	No, I mean, ever since he moved to Columbia,
797000	799000	he just started looking like an old man.
800000	801000	No, no, it looks terrible.
801000	805000	It's so gross that it's like it's like it's like Scarface.
805000	806000	Oh, no.
806000	807000	Down the side of his head.
807000	808000	Oh, man.
808000	809000	It's bad.
809000	812000	Yeah, so he was getting mugged and he was he was probably just being a douche
812000	814000	to the guy that was mugging him, right?
814000	816000	Let's not victim blame.
816000	817000	I know.
817000	818000	No, I mean, that's the thing.
818000	820000	I assume your dad deserves to be stabbed in the face.
820000	823000	Well, you don't get if you if you're getting mugged, you know,
823000	824000	they don't want to stab you.
824000	825000	They want your money.
825000	826000	You're right.
826000	827000	I was mugged once.
827000	828000	Spencer.
828000	829000	I was mugged once.
829000	830000	I was mugged in New York.
830000	839000	And these these three kids, you know, of average blackness walked up to me
839000	843000	and with a with a knife.
843000	847000	And they and I was on acid at the time, by the way, I forgot.
847000	850000	And they said, give us give us give us everything in your pockets.
850000	851000	And I said, sure.
851000	855000	I was like very nice to them and gave them my money.
855000	857000	And I said, do you want my wallet?
857000	858000	No.
858000	859000	Go.
859000	860000	What's in your other pocket?
860000	862000	And I took out a bag of pot and they took it.
862000	865000	And one guy said, man, don't take his pot.
865000	870000	I swear to God, you got to be nice to them.
870000	871000	We're very friendly.
871000	873000	And we shook hands and left and they took my money.
873000	874000	It was fine.
874000	876000	Do they have a gun or a knife?
876000	877000	There was a knife.
877000	878000	I love that.
878000	879000	I do.
879000	883000	The knife represents like I'm going to do do what I say or I'll kill you.
883000	884000	But then.
884000	885000	Yeah.
885000	886000	Well, I don't have to explain why that's funny.
886000	887000	I don't know why it's funny.
887000	890000	But then there's that humanity underneath it.
890000	891000	Don't take his pot.
891000	893000	And also, we're probably never going to kill you.
893000	894000	They were so sweet.
894000	896000	I wanted to run into them again.
896000	900000	I would walk around with my wallet in my hand.
900000	902000	Now, that part isn't true.
902000	904000	But the other part was.
904000	905000	That's what I'm saying, man.
905000	907000	You have to try hard to get stabbed.
907000	909000	You got to be nice in this world.
909000	910000	Come on, Spencer.
910000	914000	Side with your dad over an anonymous stabby man.
915000	917000	Just feel what that feels like.
917000	923000	Side with your dad over a fucking fictional character who only loves stabbing.
923000	929000	I'm pretty sure the guy was like he had the knife and he was like, hey, give me all your money or I'll stab you with this knife.
929000	931000	And he was like, fuck off or something.
931000	934000	And the guy was like, bam, right in the face.
934000	936000	And then my dad, like he thought he got punched.
936000	938000	So he started chasing after him.
938000	942000	And then he was like, oh, I can't see because there's all this blood in my eye.
943000	947000	And then he had to stop and go to the hospital and get 17 stitches.
947000	949000	And that makes your dad cool, right?
949000	953000	I mean, it's no because it's the same stuff that my whole life I'd heard about.
953000	955000	And I was like, this is psychopath behavior.
955000	957000	You're going to get hurt one of these days.
957000	958000	And there it is.
958000	959000	Yeah.
959000	960000	I mean, I don't know.
960000	961000	It was very I felt great when I found out.
961000	963000	I was like, finally.
963000	966000	I know I wasn't just being a stick in the mud all along.
966000	969000	It had a real purpose behind it.
969000	975000	But but but really seriously, did you think he was he was lying the first time he told
975000	977000	you he's told a lot of stories.
977000	982000	He told me then when he got stabbed in the face, did you have to refile any of that information?
982000	987000	Yeah, I was like that time when he ripped off the guy's rear view mirror because they
987000	989000	were driving too fast in the parking lot.
989000	991000	That probably actually happened.
991000	995000	But actually, that reminds me that that urge, like my dad has rage issues.
995000	997000	I have that too, because one time I was I was waiting.
997000	1001000	I was waiting around to pick you up or something.
1001000	1002000	I don't know.
1002000	1003000	I was by your house anyway.
1003000	1005000	Thank God for pot.
1005000	1011000	And I was just I was I was crossing the street and the car blows by and and he like blows
1011000	1012000	by right by me.
1012000	1014000	And I'm like, this is a residential neighborhood.
1014000	1018000	And he started as soon as he goes by me, he starts laying on his horn like I was fucked
1018000	1019000	up for walking.
1019000	1021000	So I was like, I'm going to teach this guy a lesson.
1021000	1023000	I start chasing after his car.
1023000	1028000	And he didn't realize I was I was chasing him until I was like right up by his rear
1028000	1031000	side, you know, mirror like the path of like the driver's side mirror.
1031000	1032000	And I was a window.
1032000	1034000	And I was like, I should rip off this guy's mirror.
1034000	1037000	And then like I was like thinking about it.
1037000	1038000	I was like, this is what my dad does.
1038000	1041000	And he's insane.
1041000	1046000	And then you are the Green Goblin.
1046000	1051000	You're James Franco's character.
1051000	1052000	This is what my dad does.
1052000	1055000	And he's insane.
1055000	1059000	I should either double down or not do it.
1059000	1060000	Yeah.
1060000	1064000	It was either the Green Goblin or Jesus Christ.
1064000	1065000	I like the thing.
1065000	1069000	I remember following a person because they flipped me off in traffic.
1069000	1074000	I remember like going into this weird meta narrative where I was following them because
1074000	1077000	I wanted them to freak out after a really long time.
1077000	1079000	Yeah.
1079000	1082000	Which is psychotic behavior.
1082000	1087000	But the thing I was using against them was the idea that I might be psychotic.
1087000	1089000	But I was.
1089000	1091000	That's what psychos do.
1091000	1095000	I followed a person for 40 minutes to freak them out.
1095000	1096000	Yeah.
1096000	1097000	I was a psycho.
1097000	1104000	And they like I followed them because it was a guy I cut him off in traffic.
1104000	1107000	And I did a bad I did it wrong.
1107000	1109000	I was in the wrong.
1109000	1111000	You don't have to boo when someone says.
1111000	1114000	He said he's wrong.
1114000	1117000	That guy hated that you admitted you were wrong.
1117000	1118000	Yeah.
1118000	1120000	He hates shame.
1120000	1123000	He's booing my shame.
1123000	1126000	It's a pride booster.
1126000	1131000	I'm going to fucking kill you.
1131000	1133000	The fuckers are talking about.
1133000	1138000	This show has a fucking structure to it.
1138000	1148000	And now I know I'm going to be my bras going to shoot sparks five seconds too early.
1148000	1154000	I'm going to I'm going to be in the middle of my anti vaccination monologue when the sparks
1154000	1157000	go off and it's going to seem like you shouldn't vaccinate your children.
1157000	1161000	And if I was going to run out and not vaccinate.
1161000	1165000	I'm fucking it up more by talking about it.
1165000	1167000	Cut a guy off.
1167000	1170000	And I followed him around and I just wanted to think I was crazy.
1170000	1172000	And he almost killed himself.
1172000	1177000	He came to a stop sign and he pulled around to somebody and started going 90 miles an
1177000	1179000	hour because he thought I was a crazy person.
1179000	1183000	And I sped up and kept following him.
1183000	1185000	And I just followed this person.
1185000	1186000	I was like a crazy.
1186000	1190000	I was a child behind two tons of steel.
1190000	1195000	I was what I was doing a bit about being.
1195000	1197000	I don't know why I'm telling you.
1197000	1199000	That happened to me once kind of.
1199000	1201000	But the other way around where someone was following me.
1201000	1204000	I was driving around with my friend from high school and he drives like a maniac.
1204000	1207000	And we cut someone off and they started following us.
1207000	1210000	And they followed us probably 20 minutes down the highway.
1210000	1212000	And we started getting into familiar territory.
1212000	1216000	So he started pulling tricks because he knew how to like lose people.
1216000	1218000	We ended up going by this college parking lot.
1218000	1220000	And they followed us all the way there.
1220000	1225000	And he did like one of those crazy like action movie things where you drive really fast and
1225000	1229000	then you slam on the brakes and like do a U-turn really quick.
1229000	1232000	And he did that and then blew past them the other way.
1232000	1235000	And then they like turned around and tried to cut us off.
1235000	1237000	And then they were coming by the exit.
1237000	1240000	And then like two dudes jump out of the car and the car is still going.
1240000	1243000	And they start sprinting full out of our car.
1243000	1246000	And like you know we were in a car so we drew away.
1246000	1250000	But it was really it was a weird climax.
1250000	1254000	It was like this is the last thing you want to do if you're trying to chase us down.
1254000	1255000	I don't know.
1255000	1259000	That's the weirdest story to not be listening to the top 10 percent of.
1259000	1264000	Because I don't I know I have no context for what I was thinking about something else.
1264000	1265000	And so I have no idea.
1265000	1269000	Yeah but we got away with the PCP.
1269000	1270000	Yeah.
1270000	1274000	Because I did all the information that I needed was in the first 10 seconds of that.
1274000	1277000	I mean allegedly I don't know if that holds up.
1277000	1278000	All right.
1278000	1280000	Well I'm going to do a terrible job doing a terrible show.
1280000	1282000	You've all been wonderful showing up.
1282000	1283000	Thank you so much.
1283000	1289000	I've been drinking all day.
1289000	1291000	Drinking all day.
1291000	1293000	But not in an unprofessional way.
1293000	1294000	Oh no.
1294000	1296000	This is the only way we could perform.
1296000	1298000	Not honoring you guys.
1298000	1300000	All the time that you spent driving here.
1300000	1303000	And every penny that you spent.
1303000	1306000	Look we're going to party with all of you after this.
1306000	1309000	I think you've got to bargain.
1309000	1312000	Oh boy.
1312000	1314000	I want to check in with Levi.
1314000	1324000	Levi where are you?
1324000	1327000	You don't have to come up if you don't want to.
1327000	1331000	Can we bring the house lights up please?
1331000	1338000	Yeah come up.
1338000	1342000	We haven't had Levi on the show for years.
1342000	1343000	He was the.
1343000	1346000	Are those socks?
1346000	1347000	Oh okay.
1347000	1348000	No they're just your feet.
1348000	1349000	Those are bare feet.
1349000	1351000	Is he allowed to do that here?
1351000	1354000	Where it not shoes?
1354000	1359000	You want me to serve you?
1359000	1362000	You're shaving.
1362000	1363000	Oh damn.
1363000	1365000	How's it going Levi?
1365000	1368000	Is he from another time and place?
1368000	1369000	I'm okay.
1369000	1370000	I'm okay.
1370000	1371000	I haven't caught up on my Harman Towns yet.
1371000	1374000	I'm on episode three.
1374000	1376000	Do I show up at any point?
1376000	1378000	Oh okay.
1378000	1379000	All right Levi.
1379000	1380000	Have a seat.
1380000	1381000	Let's check in with you.
1381000	1384000	I got to sit on this side after.
1384000	1385000	All right.
1385000	1386000	We'll get there.
1386000	1387000	All right.
1387000	1388000	Wherever you want buddy.
1388000	1389000	Do you need camera angles?
1389000	1390000	Nah you're fine.
1390000	1391000	We'll figure it out.
1391000	1392000	No just yeah.
1392000	1393000	He's worried about camera angles.
1393000	1397000	He has no shoes or socks but he's worried about camera angles.
1397000	1400000	No no no I'm half deaf.
1400000	1405000	This year is deaf so I want to be closest to Dino but I'll be able to hear.
1405000	1406000	I just came in my pants.
1406000	1409000	You guys more so.
1410000	1412000	What the fuck is going on now?
1412000	1413000	All right.
1413000	1421000	I have to ask the pronoun question because I think you're, what's the situation?
1421000	1425000	I can't navigate that minefield without sounding even more insulting.
1425000	1428000	I'm just asking your trans.
1428000	1431000	There's no way to insult.
1431000	1438000	I want she and if you want to call me she, girl, whatever you know I'm fine with it.
1438000	1443000	If you call me guy and like I really don't give a fuck.
1443000	1444000	All right.
1444000	1447000	The preferred pronoun is her she.
1447000	1449000	I'm transgendered.
1449000	1452000	I've got pretty thick skin.
1452000	1454000	I just came in your pants.
1454000	1455000	What?
1455000	1456000	Nothing.
1456000	1457000	I was a dumb joke.
1457000	1458000	See that's how deaf I am.
1458000	1459000	Oh yeah.
1459000	1460000	I should.
1460000	1461000	Yeah.
1461000	1462000	I don't know.
1462000	1463000	Let's trade.
1463000	1464000	Oh yeah.
1464000	1466000	I'll be able to hear you better.
1466000	1470000	I'm reaching for the vodka.
1470000	1473000	Second dream.
1473000	1476000	Oh here.
1476000	1477000	Thank you.
1477000	1479000	It's all vodka?
1479000	1480000	Come on, man.
1480000	1481000	Don't shame me.
1481000	1483000	Oh, do you want some cookies?
1483000	1485000	Do you want some cookies?
1485000	1486000	No, no.
1486000	1487000	I got liquid cookies.
1487000	1488000	Spencer.
1488000	1489000	Oh wait, what kind of cookies?
1489000	1492000	Everyone's clapping for a reason.
1492000	1497000	Do you think I would offer Dino Stamatopoulos like a regular chocolate chip cookie?
1497000	1498000	Oh yeah.
1498000	1503000	Give me your cookies filled with acid or whatever.
1503000	1505000	I was trying to give them out before this.
1505000	1506000	Oh, that's a small one.
1506000	1507000	Fuck that.
1507000	1510000	Is that a loose cookie?
1510000	1511000	There you go.
1511000	1512000	Oh yeah.
1512000	1513000	Yeah, it was.
1513000	1517000	I know you're weary about pot, but I know these will definitely be good for you.
1517000	1521000	You're already too high.
1521000	1528000	I taste like fabric softener.
1528000	1529000	Well, what's been going on with you, Levi?
1529000	1536000	The last time we talked to you, you were living on a ranch and you were walking over frozen piles of cow shit or something.
1536000	1538000	I can't remember.
1538000	1543000	That's a hobby, I guess, more than anything.
1543000	1546000	That wasn't an accurate description of your life's work.
1546000	1550000	No, you were giving me shit about my shoes.
1550000	1559000	I do wear them sometimes when dire consequences like lava and walking over dead animals.
1559000	1561000	There's been a lot of broken piles.
1561000	1562000	Do you live in Chicago?
1562000	1565000	No, I live in Iowa.
1565000	1569000	Just a little left of the Mississippi.
1569000	1571000	It's still cold, icy.
1571000	1575000	How long is that drive from where you are to Chicago?
1575000	1577000	Two and a half, three hours, I think.
1577000	1579000	That's flattering, thank you.
1579000	1583000	There's an Omaha, Indianapolis out here too.
1583000	1586000	I'm not the farthest.
1586000	1594000	There's another special person in the audience tonight that I wanted to bring up.
1594000	1597000	That's all of you.
1597000	1600000	I am so high.
1600000	1601000	Me too, man.
1601000	1602000	We're in this together.
1602000	1604000	I didn't eat anything today.
1604000	1608000	Except just one piece of pizza.
1608000	1612000	George, are you here?
1612000	1615000	If you want to come up, I talked to you before the show.
1615000	1617000	George, are both your ears okay?
1617000	1619000	Where do I stand?
1619000	1621000	Here, you sit here.
1621000	1622000	I wanted you to meet people.
1622000	1624000	This is really helping, actually.
1624000	1626000	Hi, this is George.
1626000	1627000	Go, George!
1627000	1629000	That's Levi.
1629000	1631000	Hi, Levi.
1631000	1635000	The last time I saw you, you were...
1635000	1638000	Sorry, I'm...
1638000	1640000	Thank you, George.
1640000	1642000	Thank you, thank you.
1642000	1645000	Really, solving all the problems today.
1645000	1647000	I'm a tech guy in a theater.
1647000	1649000	I know how to do this shit.
1649000	1652000	He has the skills.
1652000	1653000	Anytime.
1653000	1656000	What sexuality are you?
1656000	1657000	That's not...
1657000	1658000	Wait, that's not...
1658000	1659000	I don't know.
1659000	1662000	He looked at me longingly.
1662000	1666000	I was just wondering how I should react here.
1666000	1667000	Flattering, that's it.
1667000	1671000	I'll do anything for anyone.
1671000	1673000	I'm a people pleaser.
1673000	1677000	Did you really shit in a dude's mouth?
1677000	1678000	No, see.
1678000	1682000	People also tweet me like, hey, you eat shit, right?
1682000	1684000	I'm like, no, I don't eat shit.
1684000	1685000	That's crazy.
1685000	1688000	I just watched a woman shit in an old man's mouth.
1688000	1689000	That's it.
1689000	1693000	Oddly enough, that does sound more sane than eating shit.
1693000	1694000	I didn't like it.
1694000	1695000	All right.
1695000	1696000	Thanks for...
1696000	1697000	Yeah.
1697000	1698000	I never ate shit.
1698000	1702000	I mean, I probably did in a restaurant without knowing it.
1702000	1705000	We're going to Greek town tonight, right?
1705000	1706000	But once the...
1706000	1708000	You might as well tell the story.
1708000	1711000	When you watched a guy eat shit...
1711000	1714000	I mean, it's been so long and now I ate a whole cookie
1714000	1715000	and I'm drinking.
1715000	1720000	But, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm into S&M.
1720000	1721000	I have family here.
1721000	1722000	It's all right.
1722000	1723000	Just don't say cunt.
1723000	1724000	Me too.
1724000	1725000	So...
1725000	1728000	Anything but that.
1728000	1732000	Yeah, I'm into S&M and every now and then I'll say, hey,
1732000	1734000	if you ever need me for a session, bring me along
1734000	1737000	and I'll help the dominatrix.
1737000	1739000	And she said, well, this guy likes to be humiliated.
1739000	1742000	He likes to have people watch him eat shit.
1743000	1745000	She didn't actually say that before I got there.
1745000	1747000	She said it after I got there.
1747000	1750000	Before you get there, she's like, hey, want to come by?
1750000	1751000	I want to get out of session.
1751000	1752000	Oh, yeah.
1752000	1753000	Yeah, we get to...
1753000	1755000	I'll get to come on things.
1755000	1756000	And...
1756000	1758000	But...
1758000	1761000	So you get there and then you got to watch her...
1761000	1764000	And it wasn't even her shitting in someone's mouth,
1764000	1768000	which is a little better than her pulling out a baggie
1768000	1771000	with her shit in it and putting...
1771000	1775000	At least I get to see a girl's ass or something, you know?
1775000	1777000	I didn't even get to see that.
1777000	1782000	And look, you know, this is my life.
1782000	1785000	I didn't ask for it.
1785000	1790000	Now, George, I hear you've seen people eat shit.
1790000	1793000	When I was in the Navy and worked on the flight deck,
1793000	1795000	people would fall all the time and scrape up their mouths.
1795000	1799000	So that's one way of eating shit, I suppose.
1799000	1802000	They eat shit, George.
1802000	1805000	We're talking about really eating shit.
1805000	1807000	I was metaphorically speaking.
1807000	1810000	So was I when I said eat shit.
1820000	1822000	Almost done, almost done.
1822000	1825000	Done, done, done, done.
1825000	1827000	I forgot where your penis was.
1827000	1830000	I forget where my penis is, too.
1830000	1832000	It's like 1968.
1836000	1838000	You're up here, George, I'll tell you why.
1838000	1840000	Because you came up to me before the show
1840000	1842000	and you said that since the last time you saw the show,
1842000	1845000	which was a year ago, or you said...
1845000	1849000	No, since I started listening to the show.
1849000	1853000	Okay. You've had 13 deaths in your life.
1853000	1854000	Yeah.
1854000	1857000	Not in his life, in the life of people around him.
1857000	1858000	In 2015...
1858000	1862000	You only ever have one death in your life.
1862000	1863000	I'm high!
1863000	1864000	It's a game changer.
1864000	1866000	I guess, yeah.
1866000	1871000	Last year, 15 people that I knew passed away.
1871000	1872000	I got it wrong?
1872000	1875000	No, I told you since I started listening to the show,
1875000	1877000	which was when I started film school,
1877000	1879000	which actually Ridley's uncle teaches at,
1879000	1880000	which is kind of funny.
1880000	1881000	Oh, okay.
1882000	1884000	Ryan Ridley, guest comptroller.
1884000	1885000	Yes.
1887000	1888000	Yeah.
1889000	1891000	I had about...
1891000	1893000	I can't tell if people are laughing at that or me spilling out.
1893000	1896000	Yeah, a number of people that I knew passed away.
1896000	1899000	Now, this presents an awkward thing because...
1899000	1900000	Yeah, when could we laugh?
1900000	1901000	I think everybody...
1901000	1903000	Throughout the entire time.
1903000	1905000	Terrific. I don't think I know how anymore.
1905000	1906000	The thing that I think of...
1906000	1908000	What was in that cookie?
1908000	1909000	Sorry, I don't know.
1909000	1911000	It was all homemade.
1911000	1914000	As a listener, when I hear that, I think my...
1914000	1916000	I want to hear a list.
1918000	1920000	From the best to the worst.
1922000	1924000	And that means worst to best.
1924000	1925000	Worst to best.
1925000	1926000	Okay.
1926000	1927000	But if it's honestly...
1927000	1930000	I mean, I don't think I have to say
1930000	1933000	if this is going to tear your soul apart.
1933000	1935000	He said we could laugh whenever we want.
1935000	1936000	Yeah.
1936000	1938000	I'm not cajoling you into doing this.
1938000	1939000	No.
1939000	1941000	You cannot do it.
1941000	1943000	He obviously doesn't give a shit about people.
1943000	1944000	He's a sociopath.
1944000	1946000	I'm joking.
1946000	1947000	I'm a sociopath.
1949000	1950000	Yeah.
1950000	1951000	We know, Dino.
1951000	1952000	We know.
1952000	1953000	Yeah.
1953000	1956000	I mean, some of them I'm going to skip
1956000	1958000	because it's still a little too fresh
1958000	1961000	and close to my heart, but...
1961000	1962000	So I...
1964000	1967000	For a number of years, I was a pastor.
1968000	1971000	And I worked at a couple of different churches
1971000	1974000	and some of them into the thousands of people.
1974000	1977000	And some of the people that I worked with really closely,
1977000	1981000	just, you know, car accidents, heart attacks.
1981000	1985000	I worked with the unhoused population for a long time.
1985000	1987000	And so some of them froze to death.
1987000	1988000	And also Jesus died too.
1988000	1989000	That was a joke.
1989000	1990000	That was a joke.
1990000	1991000	The froze to death.
1991000	1992000	I was...
1992000	1994000	I was fine with it.
1994000	1996000	I was like, you got me, pastor.
1996000	1997000	I'm going to hell.
1997000	1999000	I absolutely accept.
1999000	2001000	I was like, I had no problem with it.
2001000	2002000	I'm like, yep, yep.
2002000	2003000	It was.
2003000	2004000	We had our fun.
2004000	2005000	We had our fun.
2005000	2006000	Was a pastor.
2006000	2008000	No longer.
2008000	2009000	You get fired twice.
2009000	2011000	You assume that it's not your job anymore.
2014000	2015000	And, yeah, for real.
2015000	2016000	And then...
2018000	2019000	Room 218.
2019000	2020000	Yeah.
2020000	2022000	I have to say at this point, you know,
2022000	2024000	saying all these people died in your life,
2024000	2026000	and you're a pastor, it's kind of cheating.
2026000	2031000	It's like I had a lot of deaths in my life.
2031000	2032000	I'm a murderer.
2032000	2033000	Right.
2033000	2035000	Like, you know, yeah, I...
2035000	2039000	My family, I had 15 deaths in my family.
2039000	2041000	I'm a community leader.
2041000	2043000	The world's my family.
2043000	2044000	No, no, no, no, no.
2045000	2046000	Was.
2046000	2050000	I left my last place three years ago.
2050000	2052000	And so, you know, it's...
2052000	2054000	When you work with people every day,
2054000	2056000	or you see them a couple times a week,
2056000	2058000	they start to become family in some senses.
2058000	2063000	And a lot of people, when they found out that I was done working for the church,
2063000	2067000	kind of left me alone, which was good.
2068000	2069000	But then...
2069000	2070000	Because, you know...
2070000	2071000	You just don't...
2071000	2072000	Rewind on that.
2072000	2073000	That seems important.
2073000	2074000	Well...
2075000	2077000	And I seem drunk and not listening well.
2077000	2078000	No, no, no, no, no.
2078000	2079000	You're doing great, man.
2079000	2081000	So, you don't want to...
2082000	2086000	The last thing you want are people in your life that are tearing you down.
2086000	2091000	Or saying, oh, we had this idea about you.
2091000	2100000	But in reality, because we're projecting the things that we assume about people onto you,
2100000	2102000	the things that we want in our life onto you,
2102000	2105000	and the moment you don't fulfill that,
2105000	2109000	there's this rug that gets pulled out from underneath you.
2109000	2112000	And you are no longer that person to them,
2112000	2116000	you are just a regular person that also has issues.
2116000	2117000	Are you...
2118000	2124000	Were you bounced from a church for having qualities or...
2125000	2127000	Did something happen to you?
2130000	2133000	So, the first church that I was let go from,
2133000	2136000	there was a book that came out a couple years ago
2136000	2139000	that asked the question about whether or not hell existed.
2139000	2143000	And I said, along the lines,
2143000	2146000	let's wait until this comes out and reads it before I say anything.
2146000	2149000	And not everybody was fine with that.
2150000	2153000	And I read the book and I agreed with the book.
2153000	2156000	And it wasn't in...
2156000	2158000	It wasn't within what the church said,
2158000	2161000	so they told me that we don't trust your theology.
2161000	2165000	And this was like a month before my wedding.
2165000	2167000	And they were like,
2167000	2169000	we're not going to ask you to come back.
2169000	2171000	Wait, does hell exist?
2171000	2173000	How does that...
2173000	2175000	Did I miss something?
2175000	2177000	Is hell there?
2177000	2179000	Let me ask you a question, Dino.
2179000	2180000	I'm in hell now.
2180000	2182000	Well, no, no, no, no. No, seriously.
2182000	2186000	Where can you imagine more horrible things happening?
2186000	2188000	Like, you live a life and you don't...
2188000	2189000	The Park West is it.
2189000	2191000	Well, I mean, like, no.
2191000	2194000	We're talking about kids with cancer.
2194000	2195000	Oh, man.
2195000	2197000	We're trying to make people laugh here.
2197000	2199000	A Flint, Michigan's water situation.
2199000	2202000	I mean, there are horrible things that are happening on Earth all the time.
2202000	2205000	Why is hell a place that you go to after you die
2205000	2210000	to spend more terrible time there and not happening currently?
2210000	2212000	Yeah, let's assume that we're there right now
2212000	2215000	and try to make it better.
2215000	2217000	Right? No, seriously, that's the thing.
2217000	2221000	Yeah, like, we're being punished for shit we did.
2221000	2222000	Oh, no.
2222000	2224000	Because there's, like, lead in the water.
2224000	2225000	Oh, yeah.
2225000	2228000	That we knew about a year ago that...
2228000	2229000	More than a year ago.
2229000	2230000	Yeah, oh, no.
2230000	2231000	I'm from Michigan.
2231000	2233000	Yeah.
2233000	2235000	So, anyways, yeah.
2235000	2237000	This podcast is either going to get the most
2237000	2241000	or the least boring in five seconds.
2241000	2244000	So, moving on.
2244000	2249000	So, then my half-brother's biological father
2249000	2251000	passed away suddenly.
2251000	2252000	Don't do that math.
2252000	2254000	Don't do that math.
2254000	2255000	So, he was part iguana?
2255000	2256000	No, it doesn't matter.
2256000	2258000	It doesn't matter.
2258000	2259000	Really?
2259000	2260000	Come on.
2260000	2263000	So, there's this guy I've known my entire life
2263000	2267000	as the dad to my brother.
2267000	2268000	And so, he passes away.
2268000	2270000	And this is kind of what started everything.
2270000	2273000	Like, we had my new friends that passed away in March and April.
2273000	2274000	I can't do that math.
2274000	2275000	That's fine.
2275000	2278000	I'm just following what Dan asked me to do.
2278000	2281000	So, then September 1st rolled around,
2281000	2283000	and then he passes away.
2283000	2287000	And then I go to...
2287000	2288000	I'm asked to do the eulogy for it,
2288000	2290000	so I go down there and I start writing it.
2290000	2292000	And then I found out that a friend of mine
2292000	2294000	from when we lived in Chicago passed away,
2294000	2296000	the morning of the funeral.
2296000	2303000	And so, for the next 12 weeks,
2303000	2306000	whatever math it is to get us to January,
2307000	2310000	friends, you know,
2310000	2311000	my great-grandmother passed away,
2311000	2313000	which is the type of person that...
2313000	2314000	Everybody has somebody in their life
2314000	2317000	that you just never imagined life without.
2317000	2321000	And then, suddenly they're gone.
2321000	2323000	And there's this 14 more people.
2323000	2324000	Well, yeah.
2324000	2325000	But this was like...
2325000	2333000	This was the catalyst to where this just depression started in.
2333000	2338000	And, you know, it felt like every week there was...
2338000	2339000	Oh, hey.
2339000	2340000	This person passed away.
2340000	2341000	Oh, hey.
2341000	2342000	Your best friend from boot camp,
2342000	2344000	who has a four-year-old son,
2344000	2346000	develops who's 29,
2346000	2349000	develops stage four colon cancer.
2349000	2353000	Like, at what point does life actually start giving back?
2353000	2357000	Because everything feels like, you know...
2357000	2358000	It's just shit.
2358000	2360000	It doesn't get any better than this, you know?
2360000	2361000	My wife is...
2362000	2365000	I feel for you, but, boy, you're like the worst priest ever.
2365000	2366000	I'm not.
2367000	2370000	Hence me not being one anymore.
2370000	2373000	Jesus Christ, man.
2373000	2375000	Yeah, people die.
2375000	2377000	My great-grandmother?
2377000	2379000	No, but you would like that.
2379000	2381000	I would like that as my pastor.
2381000	2385000	I would like to go to church and listen to that every Sunday.
2385000	2387000	Well, I mean, so, like, life is super crazy.
2387000	2389000	I would just listen to my own head, you know.
2389000	2390000	Sorry.
2390000	2391000	No apology, Ness.
2391000	2392000	You're the comptroller.
2392000	2393000	I am the comptroller.
2393000	2394000	I control everything.
2394000	2395000	Are you looking for actual advice?
2395000	2396000	What?
2396000	2398000	Are you looking for, like, actual advice for that?
2398000	2400000	Am I looking for advice?
2400000	2401000	So high.
2401000	2405000	Well, so when I came up to Dan before the show,
2405000	2406000	I was like, you know,
2406000	2409000	I started listening to Harmon Town,
2409000	2412000	and I genuinely just wanted to thank him
2412000	2414000	because there's so many...
2414000	2416000	Like, I've been fired multiple times from jobs
2416000	2417000	that I really loved,
2417000	2419000	so I connected with your story
2419000	2421000	on that, like...
2421000	2423000	No, no, like, but that's serious.
2423000	2424000	That's a real thing that happens,
2424000	2426000	and in the industry that he works in,
2426000	2427000	you don't talk about that
2427000	2429000	because it ruins your opportunity at other jobs.
2429000	2431000	Like, I was in film school
2431000	2435000	learning about the things that you don't do,
2435000	2437000	but being able to connect with somebody
2437000	2439000	on just that level alone, like,
2439000	2440000	it was insane,
2440000	2442000	and then you've got somebody pouring your soul out
2442000	2445000	every fucking week to a group of people,
2445000	2447000	like myself and all of you guys,
2447000	2448000	that understand that,
2448000	2450000	and so I went up to Dan before the show,
2450000	2452000	and I just wanted to thank him for, like, you know,
2452000	2454000	every Tuesday when the podcast drops.
2454000	2457000	I know that I have a reliable source
2457000	2459000	for laughing my ass off, or...
2459000	2460000	You're welcome.
2460000	2462000	I think we can all thank him for that, right?
2462000	2463000	Yeah!
2463000	2465000	We did it!
2465000	2466000	Yay!
2466000	2468000	Whether he believes it or not.
2468000	2469000	George, everybody!
2469000	2470000	George's pain!
2470000	2471000	Yay!
2471000	2472000	George's life!
2472000	2474000	Yay!
2474000	2475000	George!
2476000	2479000	George, sorry about everything.
2484000	2486000	Now, Pepsi...
2486000	2487000	She got a wrap!
2487000	2492000	Pepsi has put a ring under one of your seats.
2493000	2497000	And you get a free Pepsi Batman car!
2498000	2500000	It wasn't mine, was it?
2500000	2502000	Oh, shit.
2502000	2505000	All right, let's pick things up a bit
2505000	2508000	with some kind of onstage...
2510000	2512000	You want a rap battle?
2513000	2517000	Is there a... is there a rap beat?
2518000	2520000	I feel one coming! I feel one coming!
2521000	2522000	That's in your pants.
2522000	2524000	I hate rap, but I'll take one right now.
2526000	2528000	All right, shit. Here we go.
2528000	2530000	Oh, yeah.
2531000	2533000	He's going deep.
2533000	2535000	He's gonna break it down.
2535000	2536000	Break it down.
2536000	2537000	Hype.
2537000	2538000	Hype!
2539000	2540000	Yo.
2540000	2542000	Do you feel a fever?
2542000	2543000	Hype!
2543000	2544000	Yo.
2544000	2546000	We got a hum of fever.
2546000	2552000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2552000	2557000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2558000	2559000	Speed.
2561000	2563000	Yeah, speed.
2563000	2564000	Hype.
2564000	2565000	Speed.
2566000	2569000	Like speed, yeah.
2570000	2574000	Miles per hour is a measure of speed.
2575000	2576000	Tower of powers.
2577000	2580000	Everything that I measure, I need.
2581000	2583000	Fucking mama for hours of flour.
2583000	2584000	Yeah.
2584000	2585000	Throw a flower in a pot.
2585000	2589000	Fucking daddy's so hard that he said, that's hot.
2590000	2591000	Chicago style.
2591000	2593000	C-H-I-C-H-E-O.
2594000	2595000	Oh, shit.
2595000	2596000	Fucking mama.
2597000	2598000	Yo.
2598000	2599000	Doesn't...
2599000	2601000	It's not real good rapping, but it sounds good.
2601000	2602000	Yo.
2602000	2605000	It's not real good rapping, but it sounds good.
2605000	2607000	But it sounds good.
2607000	2608000	Yeah.
2608000	2609000	Yeah.
2609000	2612000	It doesn't have to be real good rapping if it sounds good.
2612000	2613000	It sounds good.
2613000	2614000	It sounds good.
2615000	2618000	East coast, west coast, west coast.
2618000	2619000	In the middle of the coast.
2620000	2622000	My name is Mr. Toast.
2623000	2625000	I put my bread where the...
2625000	2627000	I put the most bread.
2627000	2629000	That's what I said.
2629000	2632000	I put the bread where the bread was dead.
2632000	2634000	I put it down in the toast.
2634000	2638000	And the gold golden ground comes up and makes a sound.
2638000	2641000	Ch-ch-a-ch-a-ch-ch-ch-ch.
2641000	2645000	That toast is mine now.
2645000	2647000	I put the butter on it.
2647000	2649000	Oh, you better...
2649000	2651000	You better get a zone around it.
2651000	2653000	Oh, oh, shit.
2653000	2654000	Fuckin' toast.
2654000	2656000	Chicago got the most.
2656000	2657000	Coast to coast.
2657000	2659000	But Chicago got the most.
2659000	2663000	It's not on either coast.
2663000	2665000	That's why it matters the most.
2665000	2669000	Chicago got smelled like a...
2669000	2675000	It's not a lot of super famous things about your city.
2677000	2679000	Pizza, pizza.
2679000	2680000	Pizza.
2680000	2683000	It's sort of a shameful legacy.
2684000	2686000	Mayor, Mayor Byrne.
2686000	2687000	Hot dogs and pizza.
2687000	2688000	You got it, baby.
2688000	2691000	I hear the typewriter was invented here.
2691000	2694000	You...
2694000	2695000	That's a lie.
2695000	2697000	You can say in any city,
2697000	2701000	everyone believes the typewriter was invented in their city.
2701000	2702000	You can...
2702000	2705000	You'll be out the door before they look it up.
2707000	2710000	Everybody invented the typewriter in Chicago.
2710000	2712000	Get the fuck out of here.
2714000	2719000	C-H-I-C-A to the G to the double O with me.
2719000	2720000	Double!
2720000	2725000	Chicago!
2725000	2728000	A windy werewolf.
2728000	2731000	Chicago!
2731000	2737000	C to the H to the I-C-A to the G to the O and you double the play.
2737000	2739000	Got the...
2739000	2742000	Chicago!
2742000	2744000	Mick Jagger!
2744000	2745000	All right.
2745000	2747000	Let's move on with the show.
2748000	2749000	Thank you, Levi.
2749000	2752000	That was great accompaniment.
2752000	2753000	I think you did great.
2753000	2754000	That was amazing.
2754000	2755000	I really...
2755000	2756000	I love the music.
2756000	2759000	I didn't like the words that much, but the music was great.
2759000	2760000	Yeah.
2760000	2763000	Levi, is there any parting thoughts?
2763000	2766000	I don't understand you or I just love you.
2767000	2769000	Is there anything you want to...
2769000	2771000	No, I'll just leave.
2771000	2772000	Uh-oh.
2772000	2774000	Levi, what are you...
2774000	2775000	Parting God.
2776000	2778000	Give your parting thoughts before you...
2778000	2779000	You're getting ousted.
2779000	2780000	No, I know.
2780000	2781000	I'm cleaning up the stage.
2781000	2783000	No, no, I'm trying to think.
2783000	2785000	Yeah, you're 86, buddy.
2785000	2786000	Too much.
2786000	2789000	You may be a little too hard on yourself.
2791000	2792000	Me personally?
2792000	2794000	You're talking to the most narcissistic man alive.
2794000	2795000	Yeah, I don't...
2795000	2796000	Don't worry about me.
2796000	2798000	He lies about that, so don't judge.
2798000	2800000	I don't think so.
2800000	2801000	All right, Levi, everybody.
2801000	2802000	I'm his good friend.
2805000	2807000	All right, I'm all right.
2812000	2813000	I don't know what I'm doing.
2813000	2814000	What am I...
2814000	2817000	Well, did you say fuck your mother in that song?
2817000	2818000	Yeah.
2818000	2820000	That's rude.
2820000	2821000	All right.
2821000	2823000	I mean, what the fuck?
2823000	2824000	How much time do you have?
2824000	2825000	78 minutes.
2825000	2826000	More than an hour.
2826000	2827000	Okay.
2827000	2828000	All right.
2828000	2829000	Okay.
2829000	2833000	Can I talk about Greek swearing a little bit?
2833000	2834000	Yeah.
2834000	2835000	What does that mean?
2835000	2840000	I was thinking about this because of the fuck your mother thing in Greece.
2840000	2841000	Uh-oh.
2841000	2842000	He might have left something.
2842000	2843000	He left his drink.
2843000	2844000	She's sorry.
2850000	2853000	I said he left his drink, but that was okay, right?
2853000	2854000	Wait, what?
2854000	2855000	I said he left his drink.
2855000	2856000	That's okay.
2856000	2857000	Yeah, I fucked up, too.
2857000	2858000	I did it, too.
2858000	2859000	Yeah.
2859000	2860000	I mean, you know, I fucked a transsexual.
2860000	2863000	It's hard for a white male.
2864000	2870000	But Greek swearing is interesting because, like, you know, Greeks love their mothers
2870000	2872000	for whatever, you know.
2872000	2873000	They're insane.
2873000	2877000	And so, like, there's, like, three stages of Greek swearing.
2877000	2885000	And the first one is, which means fuck your village.
2885000	2888000	Your whole fucking village.
2888000	2896000	And that's deep because that's where you live.
2896000	2897000	Yeah.
2897000	2899000	Yeah.
2899000	2903000	So I might have gotten screwed up because maybe that's the second worst one.
2903000	2909000	And either the first or the other first or second one is, which is fuck your mother,
2909000	2910000	you know, up the cunt.
2910000	2912000	I added the cunt thing.
2912000	2914000	To give it a little edge.
2914000	2915000	Yeah.
2915000	2917000	Because the village one was intense.
2917000	2919000	The worst one.
2919000	2921000	Greeks are very religious, right?
2921000	2925000	And they're religious and they love their mothers.
2925000	2928000	So, of course, the Virgin Mary is huge in Greece.
2928000	2936000	So the worst way you could swear in Greece is, which is fuck your Virgin Mary.
2936000	2937000	It's crazy.
2937000	2939000	It's like fucking your whole society.
2939000	2940000	Yeah.
2940000	2941000	Fuck your whole...
2941000	2942000	Yeah.
2942000	2943000	Up the cunt.
2943000	2945000	Up your virgin cunt.
2945000	2946000	Wow.
2946000	2947000	Insane.
2947000	2948000	That's hardcore.
2948000	2950000	But do you think they have Greek food after this?
2950000	2954000	Do you think it was hard for Mary to have that kid with no...
2954000	2956000	She was still intact, probably, right?
2956000	2957000	Yeah, yeah.
2957000	2958000	Exactly.
2958000	2962000	She didn't even have a small dick in her.
2962000	2964000	And a baby came out.
2964000	2966000	And you know Jesus probably was like him.
2966000	2970000	He had a big head and shit.
2970000	2971000	Broad shoulders?
2971000	2974000	He had to have a big head.
2974000	2978000	I don't have anything else on my notepad.
2978000	2980000	Could we talk about...
2980000	2982000	The fact that you hate Weird Al?
2982000	2984000	Oh, yeah.
2984000	2986000	Because that was the...
2986000	2987000	What?
2987000	2992000	First of all, you guys are from Chicago and you're all probably too young to remember Steve Dow.
2992000	2996000	But that guy did parodies way before Weird...
2996000	2999000	And I think Weird Al stole from Steve Dow.
2999000	3000000	I think so.
3000000	3001000	What?
3001000	3003000	Fuck you.
3003000	3009000	But anyway, it took three seconds for him to write every song he wrote.
3009000	3011000	And it's ridiculous.
3011000	3012000	Another one rides the bus.
3012000	3013000	Remember I brought this up?
3013000	3015000	I actually brought this up on a bus.
3015000	3016000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3016000	3017000	And you're like, it's pretty good.
3017000	3019000	Can you think of anything better?
3019000	3021000	And I said, how about another one wipes the butts?
3021000	3022000	Oh, yeah.
3022000	3023000	That was great.
3023000	3025000	Another one wipes the butts?
3025000	3026000	Yeah.
3026000	3029000	That's amazing.
3029000	3031000	That's fantastic.
3032000	3033000	It was impressive, yeah.
3033000	3036000	I didn't even think about it.
3036000	3038000	You were on the job 10 seconds.
3038000	3040000	Yeah.
3040000	3042000	And you did a platinum record.
3042000	3045000	Fucking eat it?
3045000	3046000	It's the worst.
3046000	3048000	But instead of beating it?
3048000	3050000	Beating it.
3050000	3052000	Well, why is anyone beating it?
3052000	3054000	That's the thing is with...
3054000	3057000	I don't like Michael Jackson either.
3057000	3059000	No, come on. He was great.
3060000	3062000	What am I looking over there?
3062000	3063000	He learned juice.
3063000	3064000	Okay.
3064000	3066000	So here's the thing.
3066000	3067000	Got nothing.
3067000	3068000	Nothing.
3068000	3069000	Absolutely nothing.
3069000	3071000	Well, how much time do we have?
3071000	3072000	About an hour.
3072000	3073000	We can just bring up people?
3073000	3075000	About an hour.
3075000	3077000	Don't...
3079000	3081000	That was amazing.
3082000	3087000	Someone said Hillary Clinton, but the inflection was on point.
3090000	3092000	It was really well-elicuted.
3092000	3098000	Were you a person that wanted to come up and give support to Hillary Clinton,
3098000	3100000	or were you someone that wanted to...
3100000	3104000	I think she was playing off a joke that, you know, we do that a lot.
3104000	3105000	Yeah.
3105000	3108000	That we have random people come up and bark weird shit.
3108000	3109000	Okay.
3109000	3110000	All right.
3110000	3111000	Okay.
3111000	3112000	All right.
3112000	3113000	Point taken.
3113000	3114000	So you demand the show.
3114000	3115000	Basic-mentum is real.
3115000	3116000	It's a show you demand.
3116000	3117000	Is it Chicago?
3120000	3121000	Very well.
3121000	3124000	A show you shall have.
3126000	3129000	This city invented the cabaret, did it?
3131000	3135000	The old professional song and dance men.
3135000	3137000	The smell of the grease paint.
3137000	3140000	The glint of the footlights.
3140000	3142000	Chicago.
3142000	3145000	A performance town.
3145000	3148000	A theater town.
3148000	3149000	Yes.
3149000	3150000	Oh, yeah.
3150000	3152000	We've prepared something for you.
3154000	3155000	Hit it.
3161000	3162000	Lights.
3163000	3164000	Perfect.
3164000	3165000	Thank you.
3166000	3167000	Lights.
3177000	3178000	Oh, okay, okay.
3178000	3179000	We're actually...
3179000	3180000	Okay.
3188000	3189000	Do you want a music cue?
3189000	3193000	Yeah, I mean, music of any kind would be great, but...
3193000	3194000	Yeah, yeah.
3195000	3196000	Of any kind.
3206000	3207000	Yeah.
3209000	3210000	Yeah.
3221000	3223000	Just give me one second.
3226000	3228000	I need more in my monitor.
3228000	3229000	I need more.
3229000	3230000	Did you hear this?
3230000	3231000	Yeah, okay, good.
3231000	3232000	Perfect, perfect, perfect.
3232000	3233000	Okay.
3233000	3234000	There we go.
3244000	3247000	It's a tower of delights.
3247000	3250000	It's a maze in the night.
3250000	3253000	It's a fur-laden trap food.
3253000	3256000	And you go, and you go, and you go.
3256000	3257000	Oh.
3257000	3258000	Oh.
3260000	3262000	Let's go.
3262000	3266000	And you go, and you go, and you go.
3266000	3272000	It's a scintillating, Bjork-extacted thing.
3272000	3278000	I'm in the maze of concrete and jungle pipes.
3279000	3283000	I'm sort of evoking Bjork.
3283000	3284000	Yeah.
3285000	3291000	It's a city of lights, and all the lights, and all the lights.
3291000	3294000	Windy city, Chicago delights.
3294000	3300000	Every window says goodnight to every babe and child.
3300000	3307000	And at the spirits running wild, and every dance floor in Chicago.
3308000	3316000	I see pectoral muscles glistening with oil and sweat.
3316000	3320000	My name is Zeus McChicago.
3320000	3323000	I am a gay god.
3323000	3327000	I will zap you with the lightning boot.
3327000	3328000	Music's not fair.
3328000	3329000	Okay.
3333000	3336000	I am Chicago.
3336000	3339000	I am Miyago.
3339000	3342000	I'll go to Spago.
3342000	3345000	I am the city of Chicago.
3345000	3348000	And go, and go, and go.
3348000	3352000	My name is Jeff Johnson.
3352000	3358000	I just came up from the audience,
3358000	3362000	and I was hoping that you had changed for a dollar.
3362000	3364000	What the fuck?
3364000	3365000	Get out of here.
3365000	3366000	You can't.
3366000	3367000	This is a professional.
3367000	3368000	I'm sorry.
3368000	3369000	My name's Jeff Johnson.
3369000	3370000	I'm sorry.
3370000	3371000	I'm sorry.
3371000	3372000	I'm sorry.
3372000	3377000	But, you know, you know, I'll say, you could have been a little more polite.
3377000	3379000	I obviously made an honest mistake.
3379000	3382000	I came here with the wife and kids tonight.
3382000	3383000	I'm seeing your show.
3383000	3384000	It's about Chicago.
3384000	3385000	It's about firebolts.
3385000	3388000	I need to change for a dollar.
3388000	3392000	Your vending machine should accept dollars if you don't want that to happen.
3392000	3400000	You know, I drive down here from Racine, and I...
3400000	3401000	Racine, yeah.
3401000	3402000	Racine jokes.
3402000	3405000	Oh, I see.
3405000	3411000	Anyways, my name's Jeff Johnson, and I don't need to put up with this shit.
3411000	3414000	I don't understand what you guys are going to get.
3414000	3415000	Oh, it's 9-11.
3415000	3416000	It's 9-11.
3416000	3417000	Okay.
3417000	3421000	It's 9-11.
3422000	3423000	Jesus.
3423000	3426000	You poor kids.
3426000	3429000	Deprived your 9-11 joke.
3429000	3431000	You're like little...
3431000	3432000	You love it.
3432000	3433000	All right.
3433000	3434000	Here we go.
3434000	3437000	Here's the third act of the...
3438000	3439000	Oh, no.
3439000	3442000	I can't control the inferno.
3442000	3450000	The fire's coming down, and I am sexing all around Chicago.
3450000	3451000	Chicago.
3451000	3454000	Chicago.
3454000	3456000	Chicago.
3456000	3458000	Chicago.
3458000	3461000	We are a land of you.
3461000	3467000	C-H-I-C-A-G-O.
3469000	3470000	Period.
3475000	3476000	Yeah.
3476000	3477000	All right.
3477000	3478000	You got it.
3480000	3481000	That's enough.
3481000	3482000	All right.
3482000	3484000	I know sarcasm when I heard it.
3484000	3485000	So you didn't like it.
3485000	3486000	Big deal.
3486000	3487000	Guess what?
3487000	3488000	I made it up.
3488000	3491000	It took me no time.
3491000	3493000	So you're sitting there judging it, and you're like,
3493000	3495000	I didn't like this as much as the other thing.
3495000	3498000	I don't even know what it is.
3498000	3500000	You robot.
3500000	3501000	I just live...
3501000	3504000	I'm a genius.
3504000	3506000	Can I pitch something to you?
3506000	3507000	Yeah.
3507000	3509000	I ate a pizza the other night, like a whole pizza,
3509000	3511000	before I went to sleep.
3511000	3513000	And then I had a dream.
3513000	3515000	But it was a dream.
3515000	3518000	It was a whole fucking, like, movie.
3518000	3520000	And I wrote it down when I woke up.
3520000	3521000	Can I pitch the movie to you?
3521000	3523000	I swear to God, this is all a dream.
3526000	3528000	And it's supposed to be a comedy.
3528000	3531000	It's called Hot Rod Parade.
3531000	3532000	It's called... I'm sorry.
3532000	3534000	Hot Rod Parade.
3534000	3535000	Hot Rod Parade.
3535000	3536000	Hot Rod, like a hot rod.
3536000	3539000	Like a hot rod parade.
3539000	3542000	So Luke is in love with Becky.
3545000	3549000	But she's into Brad because he's got the hottest hot rod
3549000	3551000	that she knows.
3551000	3554000	And she knows it's going to come in first place
3554000	3556000	at the local hot rod parade.
3556000	3559000	You dreamt this and then wrote it down?
3559000	3560000	Yeah.
3560000	3561000	I woke up.
3561000	3563000	I'm like, this is an amazing movie.
3567000	3572000	Luke wishes he had $500,000 to buy the Turbo 5000.
3573000	3575000	I don't know anything about cars, by the way.
3575000	3578000	I think you become a genius in dreams for some reason.
3578000	3580000	All of a sudden you know everything about cars.
3580000	3581000	Yeah.
3581000	3585000	The Turbo 5000, a hot rod that would blow Brad's hot rod
3585000	3587000	out of the water.
3588000	3589000	But Luke is poor.
3589000	3593000	And his dad is only a Chinese philosophy teacher.
3594000	3596000	That's like the lowest job of all.
3596000	3597000	Yeah.
3597000	3598000	Yeah.
3598000	3599000	And he's Chinese.
3599000	3600000	Right.
3600000	3603000	He's a Chinese philosophy teacher and he's Chinese.
3603000	3604000	Wait.
3604000	3605000	Wait.
3605000	3606000	Go back.
3606000	3607000	Okay.
3607000	3608000	He's...
3608000	3609000	What do you mean?
3609000	3610000	He's Chinese.
3610000	3612000	Does he teach Chinese philosophy and he's also...
3612000	3613000	Yeah.
3613000	3614000	And he also happens...
3614000	3615000	Well, I mean happens.
3615000	3616000	It's not...
3616000	3617000	Yeah.
3617000	3618000	It's no coincidence.
3618000	3620000	But how do you know that from the document?
3620000	3621000	How do I know what?
3621000	3623000	How do you know that from what you wrote?
3623000	3624000	Because I wrote it.
3624000	3625000	I saw a little squinty guy.
3625000	3626000	It's your dream.
3626000	3627000	Okay.
3627000	3628000	I'm sorry.
3628000	3629000	What the fuck?
3629000	3630000	I'm sorry.
3630000	3631000	I'm sorry.
3631000	3632000	I'm sorry.
3632000	3633000	So he's a Chinese philosophy teacher, the most underfunded
3633000	3635000	program in the college.
3635000	3637000	Like you said.
3637000	3641000	Brad's dad, the bad guy, runs the auto arts and mechanics
3641000	3642000	department.
3642000	3647000	And is not only rich but makes sure Brad can add the coolest
3647000	3650000	accessories onto his hot rod.
3652000	3654000	You just woke up and wrote this.
3654000	3655000	I fucking...
3655000	3656000	Yes.
3656000	3659000	I swear to God.
3659000	3665000	So Luke's dad, the little Chinaman, tells him he doesn't
3665000	3667000	need material things to get Becky.
3667000	3672000	He can get her with his inner light.
3672000	3675000	Luke's just embarrassed of his dad and decides to take the
3675000	3680000	auto arts class in order to build a hot rod from scratch.
3680000	3684000	But Brad, whose dad runs it, learns the plan and gets his
3684000	3688000	dad to thwart Luke around every corner.
3688000	3692000	Luke gets very frustrated and in his final desperation learns
3692000	3696000	to overcome his frustrations through meditation and finds
3696000	3698000	his inner light.
3698000	3701000	I'm only halfway through.
3701000	3704000	When you finished thumbing this in, did you have to go back to
3704000	3709000	sleep because your whole day had gone by?
3709000	3712000	Through this, Luke makes the coolest hot rod ever regardless
3712000	3714000	of dad's Brad's thwarting.
3714000	3718000	It's a day before the hot rod parade and Brad just breaks into
3718000	3719000	the shop and destroys...
3719000	3721000	I love that it's a hot rod parade.
3721000	3722000	It's not a race.
3722000	3723000	Yeah.
3723000	3725000	But you still got it coming first.
3725000	3727000	It's a parade.
3727000	3729000	It's like there's a flag at the end.
3729000	3730000	Yeah.
3730000	3736000	So yeah.
3736000	3740000	So Brad breaks into the shop and destroys Luke's hot rod.
3740000	3748000	Luke meditates so much inner light that he is observed by a
3748000	3752000	MacArthur grant committee member.
3752000	3755000	My friend actually in New York has got the MacArthur grant that
3756000	3760000	I've been obsessing over it for years, actually.
3760000	3763000	And he gets an award for his meditation.
3763000	3766000	I don't know if you can get an award.
3766000	3771000	Plus he wins Becky and his dad says, see, it's material.
3771000	3776000	It's not your material needs.
3776000	3778000	It's your light that got her.
3778000	3781000	And Luke half heartedly at the end says, thanks, dad.
3781000	3783000	As the old Chinaman leaves.
3783000	3787000	And then Luke winks at the camera and we cut to him driving with
3787000	3790000	Becky with his brand new turbo 5000 that he bought with the
3790000	3796000	MacArthur grant money.
3796000	3797000	And that's your...
3797000	3798000	That was the dream.
3798000	3799000	And then you wrote it all down.
3799000	3800000	Since then I added this.
3800000	3804000	I added like flutes playing.
3804000	3807000	And like you see Luke's dad from behind like by a pond, like
3807000	3809000	just sitting peacefully.
3809000	3813000	And just like it's from behind and you close up on him and it's
3813000	3815000	just like really beautiful.
3815000	3819000	And then you cut to in front of him and he's just jacking off.
3819000	3820000	I think that's a good ending.
3820000	3821000	Well, sorry.
3821000	3822000	What do you think?
3822000	3829000	I went to a therapist once.
3829000	3831000	And he said...
3831000	3834000	He was really expensive and I couldn't keep going to him.
3834000	3838000	But he said, give yourself permission to have a significant
3838000	3840000	dream tonight when you get home.
3840000	3843000	And then I went home and I dreamt and I had this really
3843000	3844000	significant dream.
3844000	3846000	But I never went back to the guy.
3846000	3847000	Do you think...
3847000	3849000	Maybe we don't want to be healthy.
3849000	3850000	No, we don't.
3850000	3851000	I don't want...
3851000	3852000	Yeah, I don't want to be healthy.
3852000	3853000	I think...
3853000	3854000	I don't think it was...
3854000	3857000	I think I didn't go back to the guy because he might have made
3857000	3858000	me sane.
3858000	3859000	Yeah.
3859000	3860000	And who wants a sane Harmon?
3860000	3861000	No one.
3861000	3863000	Not crazy Harmon.
3863000	3868000	I don't know.
3868000	3871000	But I mean, would you buy that movie?
3871000	3872000	What?
3872000	3873000	Would you buy that movie?
3873000	3874000	Yeah, man.
3874000	3877000	I didn't see Karate Kid but I think it has some Karate Kid in it.
3877000	3878000	What?
3878000	3879000	Sane Harmon?
3879000	3880000	No.
3880000	3881000	My...
3881000	3882000	You're such a narcissist.
3882000	3883000	I didn't...
3883000	3884000	I'm talking about me!
3884000	3885000	Sorry.
3885000	3887000	Do you remember my pitch?
3887000	3890000	With the Chinese guy?
3890000	3891000	Little Chinaman?
3892000	3893000	Oh, come on.
3895000	3896000	No.
3896000	3897000	You wouldn't buy it.
3897000	3898000	I know.
3898000	3899000	I...
3899000	3900000	You mean your dream?
3900000	3901000	You wouldn't buy my dream?
3901000	3902000	I'd like your dream.
3902000	3903000	Would you buy it?
3903000	3904000	Yeah.
3904000	3905000	You have a studio?
3905000	3906000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3906000	3907000	All right.
3907000	3908000	Thank you.
3908000	3909000	I want it.
3909000	3910000	I want it for a million dollars.
3910000	3912000	I guarantee the show's going to be over.
3912000	3914000	We're going to be eating Greek food and he's going to say,
3914000	3917000	I lied about the million dollars.
3917000	3918000	All right.
3918000	3920000	I want to do a new thing tonight.
3920000	3921000	We're going to create...
3921000	3924000	We're going to create a karma battery.
3924000	3930000	I want the person that's having the best night of their life.
3930000	3932000	Okay.
3933000	3935000	Somebody left to their feet.
3935000	3936000	I think that's a...
3936000	3937000	Is that a young lady that...
3937000	3938000	Yeah.
3938000	3939000	You.
3939000	3941000	Yeah, it's you.
3942000	3944000	Well, come up if you...
3944000	3951000	Come on down.
3951000	3954000	I don't know what I'm doing.
3954000	3955000	I don't know what I'm doing.
3955000	3956000	It doesn't matter.
3956000	3957000	Let's see what...
3957000	3958000	She has the pitch.
3958000	3959000	Hello.
3959000	3960000	What's your name?
3960000	3962000	My name's Camille.
3962000	3963000	Camille.
3963000	3964000	All right.
3964000	3965000	Camille.
3965000	3966000	We know a cool name.
3966000	3967000	No, I'm from Minnesota.
3967000	3968000	I go to...
3968000	3969000	I go to college here.
3969000	3970000	All right.
3970000	3971000	Which college?
3971000	3973000	I go to Columbia College Chicago.
3973000	3975000	Well, Columbia.
3975000	3977000	Yeah.
3977000	3979000	You know, I went to Columbia.
3979000	3980000	Yeah.
3980000	3981000	Yeah.
3981000	3982000	I graduated there.
3982000	3983000	I pretended I graduated.
3983000	3984000	I stole...
3984000	3985000	There's a couple other people that went to Columbia.
3985000	3988000	Jesus fucking Christ.
3988000	3989000	That's right.
3989000	3992000	Ask Pastor George.
3992000	3993000	Okay.
3993000	3994000	I already forgot your name.
3994000	3995000	Camille.
3995000	3996000	Yeah.
3996000	3997000	All right.
3997000	3998000	Just think of Camille Cosby, right?
3998000	3999000	No.
3999000	4000000	Why?
4000000	4002000	Just think of the sound Camille.
4002000	4003000	Camille.
4003000	4004000	It's a name.
4004000	4005000	The whole point of it is to be random.
4005000	4006000	Yeah, but that's his wife.
4006000	4007000	That's the wife that he fucked around on.
4007000	4008000	All right.
4008000	4009000	Jesus.
4009000	4010000	Yeah.
4010000	4011000	He gave pills to women, remember?
4011000	4012000	Christ above.
4012000	4013000	I'm so sorry.
4013000	4014000	All right.
4014000	4015000	Camille, so you're kind of like...
4015000	4016000	You're kind of like...
4016000	4017000	You're feeling your privilege.
4017000	4019000	You're like walking on the fucking cloud.
4019000	4021000	I'm so happy right now.
4021000	4023000	Well, give me just examples.
4023000	4026000	Just like little snatches of it.
4026000	4027000	Okay.
4027000	4031000	So like low key, you've saved my life a bunch of times.
4031000	4032000	Low key?
4032000	4033000	Low key.
4033000	4035000	The god of mischief saved your life?
4035000	4036000	No.
4036000	4038000	That's a Norwegian god, right?
4038000	4039000	Low key?
4039000	4040000	Low key.
4040000	4042000	It's going to get really personal for a second, but...
4042000	4043000	Are you Norwegian?
4043000	4044000	Or macrocosmological.
4044000	4045000	Maybe.
4045000	4047000	I don't know, but like...
4047000	4049000	There's a tesseract involved.
4049000	4050000	Probably.
4050000	4051000	Sorry.
4051000	4052000	No, no, no.
4052000	4053000	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
4053000	4054000	That's the chair.
4054000	4055000	That was the chair.
4055000	4056000	It's okay.
4057000	4059000	I have a lot of like...
4067000	4068000	Go ahead.
4068000	4071000	I've had some issues with like mental health in my life.
4071000	4073000	And I've gotten a lot better recently.
4073000	4075000	How did you end up in my audience?
4075000	4076000	I know.
4076000	4077000	Don't let me get there.
4077000	4080000	And I listen to your podcast and you make me laugh.
4080000	4081000	Well, all of you do.
4081000	4082000	Thank you.
4082000	4084000	Do I make you laugh too?
4084000	4086000	Well, tonight you're kind of...
4086000	4088000	Tonight you're on the edge a little bit.
4088000	4090000	Like you said the n-word at the beginning.
4090000	4091000	That was a little harsh, but...
4091000	4093000	Which n-word?
4093000	4094000	What?
4094000	4095000	Which n-word?
4095000	4096000	I don't know.
4096000	4097000	You don't know?
4097000	4098000	Then why are you worried about it?
4098000	4099000	I like you though.
4099000	4101000	I think you're really funny.
4101000	4102000	Okay.
4102000	4103000	I appreciate you.
4103000	4104000	I appreciate you.
4104000	4105000	All right.
4105000	4106000	Continue, continue.
4106000	4108000	But I would like listen to your podcast and you would make me laugh.
4108000	4109000	And all of you would.
4109000	4111000	And it would just make me really happy.
4111000	4112000	And I love this whole crowd.
4112000	4114000	Like you guys are the best people in the world.
4114000	4115000	All right.
4115000	4116000	Okay.
4116000	4118000	And the reason that today is like the best day of my life, right?
4118000	4120000	Is because I didn't know that there was a show tonight.
4120000	4123000	But then I found out and it was already sold out.
4123000	4125000	And I was like, oh man, but I gotta be here.
4125000	4128000	So I like got down here.
4128000	4129000	I took the brown line.
4129000	4134000	I was just gonna like wait in line and like see what kind of miracles could happen, right?
4134000	4138000	And I was waiting out like in the like at the end of the line.
4138000	4141000	And the two most wonderful people in the world, Spencer and Nicole.
4142000	4144000	They're my new friends.
4144000	4146000	They were behind me talking.
4146000	4147000	And I was like listening to music.
4147000	4150000	Like I was listening to the Ben Folds cover of Bitches Ain't Shit.
4150000	4154000	But it was quiet enough that I could hear Spencer talking behind me.
4154000	4155000	Not this Spencer.
4155000	4156000	Yeah, not me.
4156000	4158000	And he said that he had a free ticket.
4158000	4160000	Like he didn't have a free ticket, but he had an extra ticket.
4160000	4161000	And I turned around.
4161000	4163000	I was like, dude, you have an extra ticket?
4163000	4164000	And he was like, yeah.
4164000	4165000	And he was like, I'll just give it to you.
4165000	4167000	So he gave me his extra ticket.
4167000	4168000	And now I'm here.
4168000	4169000	And I'm talking to you.
4169000	4170000	Nice.
4171000	4174000	And it's just like the best night of my life.
4174000	4176000	So I'm just really happy.
4176000	4177000	Thank you so much.
4177000	4178000	Thank you.
4178000	4179000	Thank you, Spencer and Nicole.
4179000	4180000	Thank you so much.
4180000	4181000	So now you know what I want to do.
4181000	4182000	But it feels terrible.
4182000	4185000	Like I kind of like I just have this weird mad scientist directive.
4185000	4189000	Like I have to I have to find a person who had the worst night tonight.
4189000	4190000	Oh no.
4190000	4194000	Because I want to just watch the electricity arc.
4194000	4195000	Like between the two people.
4195000	4196000	Who?
4196000	4198000	And listen, man.
4198000	4199000	Yeah.
4199000	4204000	If in your heart of hearts you were really cranky tonight and had a bad night.
4204000	4205000	Okay.
4205000	4206000	Young lady.
4206000	4208000	Do you want to come up?
4208000	4209000	Yeah.
4209000	4211000	I just kind of, I don't know.
4211000	4212000	Curious.
4212000	4213000	Yeah.
4213000	4215000	And have her stay up here and then have them fight it out.
4215000	4216000	Like punch out.
4216000	4217000	No.
4217000	4218000	They don't have any quarrel with each other.
4218000	4220000	It's just that they've had two different nights.
4220000	4221000	Not quarrel.
4221000	4222000	Just fight.
4222000	4223000	Punch.
4223000	4224000	Like a cat fight.
4224000	4225000	Come over here.
4225000	4228000	And is there...
4229000	4230000	Dino, you have a mic.
4230000	4231000	Here's one right here.
4231000	4232000	Got it.
4232000	4233000	Okay.
4233000	4234000	Find the candy, baby.
4234000	4235000	There we go.
4235000	4236000	Thank you very much.
4236000	4237000	Of course.
4237000	4238000	Fool me once.
4238000	4240000	So what's your name?
4240000	4241000	Camilla.
4241000	4242000	Camilla.
4242000	4243000	Wait.
4243000	4244000	Really?
4244000	4245000	Oh my God.
4245000	4246000	What the fuck?
4246000	4247000	Don't touch each other.
4247000	4250000	It's like time cop.
4250000	4251000	This is great.
4251000	4252000	Holy shit.
4252000	4253000	My name's Camilla.
4253000	4254000	I am the best podcast ever.
4254000	4256000	My name's Camilla too.
4256000	4257000	Okay.
4257000	4260000	Camilla, what was your experience?
4260000	4262000	Well...
4262000	4264000	So I'm an insomniac.
4264000	4265000	Like a lot of people.
4265000	4267000	Like a lot of creative people.
4267000	4268000	Don't go to them.
4268000	4269000	I sleep like a baby.
4269000	4271000	What does that say?
4271000	4274000	You're the exception that proves the rule.
4274000	4277000	Find the candy, baby.
4277000	4279000	Of my soul.
4279000	4284000	So about eight years ago, my doctor gave me some Ambien.
4284000	4286000	And it was amazing.
4286000	4288000	Because I could sleep.
4288000	4289000	Just sleep.
4289000	4291000	Just effortlessly sleep.
4291000	4292000	Like the...
4292000	4297000	Like the joy of just being able to fucking go to sleep.
4297000	4298000	And dream.
4298000	4299000	You know what I mean?
4299000	4301000	And just like feel completely rested the next day.
4301000	4303000	That in and of itself is addictive.
4303000	4307000	But it's also highly chemically addictive.
4307000	4310000	So...
4310000	4312000	So my doctor...
4312000	4315000	So my doctor was like, are you having, you know, side effects?
4315000	4318000	Do you sleep eat or sleep drive or like call people?
4318000	4320000	And I didn't do any of those things.
4320000	4321000	I didn't have hallucinations.
4321000	4323000	I didn't need to keep increasing my dose.
4323000	4325000	So she said, oh, just keep taking it.
4325000	4327000	And I was like, I'm taking it every night.
4327000	4334000	And she was like, well, if it's working for you, go ahead.
4334000	4339000	So like eight years later, I've been taking it every night for eight years.
4339000	4341000	And these studies start coming out.
4341000	4348000	That link it long term and being used to like major instances of like early onset dementia
4348000	4350000	and cancer.
4350000	4352000	And I started actually investigating it.
4352000	4357000	And I learned this drug was never designed or intended to be taken long term.
4357000	4359000	Like at all.
4359000	4360000	All right.
4360000	4363000	Well, that makes for a bad night, I think.
4363000	4366000	You deserve a second microphone.
4366000	4367000	There you go.
4367000	4370000	I guess my experiment worked out perfectly.
4370000	4372000	I haven't even gotten to the worst part yet.
4372000	4374000	Oh, no, no.
4374000	4376000	You know, take us to the worst.
4376000	4377000	The horror story, kids.
4377000	4378000	Come on.
4378000	4379000	It's all right.
4379000	4380000	Use both.
4380000	4381000	Okay.
4381000	4382000	I'm sorry.
4382000	4383000	A ball joke in there.
4383000	4384000	But I don't know what to say.
4384000	4388000	You got to wait in the fuck up when you're around here.
4388000	4389000	Okay.
4389000	4390000	So I went off.
4390000	4391000	I tapered off.
4391000	4394000	I tapered off my dose, which is what you're supposed to do.
4394000	4395000	Wait.
4395000	4396000	You tapered off.
4396000	4399000	You know, like tape less and less, you know.
4399000	4401000	And until I was finally off of it.
4401000	4404000	And, you know, I had a couple nights where I didn't sleep at all.
4404000	4406000	But when you're in insomniac, you're used to that.
4406000	4408000	Like that's kid stuff, right?
4408000	4410000	And then this other symptom started all of a sudden.
4410000	4411000	This withdrawal symptom.
4411000	4415000	Where, so, you know how you drift off?
4415000	4417000	There's a name for this state, which I can't remember.
4417000	4419000	But, you know, when you drift off to sleep,
4419000	4423000	there's that state in between conscious and unconscious.
4423000	4424000	Yeah.
4424000	4427000	It's like, it's like, it's like a hypagogic or something.
4427000	4428000	Hypnagogic.
4428000	4429000	Hypnagogic.
4429000	4430000	Hypnagogic.
4430000	4431000	Really?
4431000	4433000	It's called really tired.
4433000	4434000	That state.
4434000	4436000	You know how people get hypnic?
4436000	4437000	It's called the taint.
4437000	4438000	I think it's called taint.
4438000	4443000	That tainty.
4443000	4449000	I'm not in the balls of wakefulness nor the anus hole of...
4449000	4451000	All right.
4451000	4456000	So, you know, usually when you fall asleep, everybody gets this once in a while.
4456000	4459000	That thing where you're in that state and you get that feeling that you're falling
4459000	4460000	and you wake up.
4460000	4461000	Yeah.
4461000	4462000	Hypnic jerks.
4462000	4463000	Yeah.
4463000	4464000	Okay.
4464000	4465000	Hypnic jerks, right?
4465000	4466000	Hypno jerk.
4466000	4467000	Hypno jerk.
4467000	4468000	Hypno jerks.
4468000	4469000	All right.
4469000	4470000	It's the name of my punk band.
4470000	4471000	Jesus Christ.
4471000	4472000	You guys take it easy.
4472000	4476000	So, I started getting this thing where, you know, I fall asleep and as soon as I would
4476000	4479000	hit that state, I would get a surge of adrenaline and I wake up.
4479000	4482000	But the thing is, it happens every single time.
4483000	4488000	So, as I lay there for the whole night, every single time, which is roughly every, like,
4488000	4493000	10 minutes, every time I get tired enough to drift off to sleep, I get a surge of adrenaline
4493000	4497000	which feels like getting an EpiPen injection, which I know from allergies.
4497000	4501000	And it hurts after a while.
4501000	4505000	And so, you know, you wake up throughout the night, again and again and again and again.
4505000	4509000	You don't get any sleep, but you keep getting adrenaline rushes.
4509000	4511000	And then it keeps happening, like, every night.
4511000	4512000	All right.
4512000	4513000	Well...
4515000	4516000	Silver lining.
4516000	4517000	Quick loading.
4517000	4519000	It has tranquilized area.
4519000	4520000	Oh, do you know?
4520000	4524000	But if you can sleep and I can just watch you sleep, that'll be enough for me.
4527000	4528000	All right.
4528000	4529000	Well...
4529000	4530000	Sorry.
4530000	4531000	Thanks for listening.
4531000	4533000	No, thank you for sharing your...
4533000	4535000	Sounds horrific.
4535000	4536000	It was a good story.
4536000	4537000	But this is the Park West.
4537000	4540000	We need to entertain people here.
4540000	4542000	Let's do a little dance like you did.
4542000	4543000	Yeah.
4543000	4544000	Dance it, baby.
4544000	4545000	Oh, fight.
4545000	4546000	How about a cat fight?
4546000	4548000	Let's have a hand for Camilla, everybody.
4548000	4549000	Thank you.
4549000	4550000	Thank you.
4550000	4551000	All right.
4551000	4552000	Okay.
4552000	4556000	And then that social cue is not universal.
4556000	4558000	Well, what about...
4558000	4562000	Hey, the other day I was thinking...
4571000	4574000	How does the karma battery work?
4574000	4575000	All right.
4575000	4578000	Camilla, you go back to...
4578000	4581000	You enjoy the rest of the show, Camilla.
4581000	4586000	And I want to do another thing where you stay here.
4586000	4587000	Camille?
4587000	4588000	Camille, yeah.
4588000	4591000	I still want to find the anti-Camille.
4591000	4592000	Okay.
4592000	4593000	So who's night tonight?
4593000	4595000	Who's called Carmilla out there?
4596000	4599000	Better be entertained.
4599000	4600000	All right.
4600000	4601000	You know what?
4601000	4602000	Better be entertained.
4602000	4603000	Okay.
4603000	4604000	Yeah.
4604000	4605000	Come on up.
4605000	4606000	Sorry.
4606000	4607000	Yeah.
4607000	4608000	I'm trying to sell tickets here.
4608000	4609000	I know.
4609000	4614000	This guy, he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders.
4614000	4617000	I hope you know how to dance.
4617000	4618000	Oh, okay.
4618000	4619000	Here.
4619000	4620000	Sorry.
4620000	4622000	You don't have to look for it.
4622000	4623000	All right.
4623000	4624000	What's your name, sir?
4624000	4625000	My name is Sean.
4625000	4626000	Sean.
4626000	4627000	Hi, Dan.
4627000	4628000	Okay.
4628000	4629000	Tell us about your evening.
4629000	4630000	Hi.
4630000	4631000	Say hi to Spencer.
4631000	4632000	Hey, Spencer.
4632000	4633000	Thank you.
4633000	4634000	My evening is going all right.
4634000	4640640	I loved hearing how everything was like really inspiring for you.
4640640	4643400	Everything that's happened with the show is really inspiring for you.
4643400	4649880	And it was kind of like that for me, like when your show first started, when this podcast
4649880	4657360	first started, you like, the thing that amazed me the most about it was that you and Jeff
4657360	4658360	never quit.
4658360	4663240	Like you never, like if, if you're a freestyler, whatever didn't work, you just kept going
4663240	4669280	and you never gave up and it was you and Aaron and sorry, and you guys never stopped.
4669280	4678480	And I was just meeting, I was just meeting the woman that I would marry and I was like,
4678480	4679840	I was like, oh my God.
4679840	4682160	Like, like this guy never stops.
4682160	4686800	It's like sometimes it gets difficult and sometimes it gets embarrassing and sad, but
4686800	4687800	he never stops.
4687800	4688800	This is amazing.
4688800	4696760	No matter how fat he gets or how unfunny he is or how gross everyone thinks he is, how
4696760	4698560	much everyone hates him.
4698560	4701600	And then it stopped and I, and it's not your fault.
4701600	4705920	Of course it's not your fault, but I like, it's like, it's something, something was really
4705920	4708080	sad about that, man.
4708080	4710280	Something was, made me really sad.
4710280	4715240	I didn't know how to deal with it because, because like what you and Aaron had going
4715240	4723320	and like it's in the mirror, my relationship so perfectly, leave the world Camilla and,
4723320	4725760	and I just thought it was amazing.
4725760	4729880	And then, and then, and then some changed and I just, I guess I don't know how to, I
4729880	4733240	shouldn't have this much investment in your life at all.
4733240	4735200	Are you saying the podcast got worst?
4735840	4740600	No, he's saying, he's saying you're, you're, I care about, he's saying, he's saying your
4740600	4747960	desperation to be funny is kind of sad and like, I'm saying like there was, there, there's
4747960	4753560	been times when I, I, I, I believe that what I was doing could work because you always
4753560	4754880	made it work.
4754880	4756040	You always made it work.
4756040	4760120	You never stop, but that's sad because he never stops.
4760120	4761120	He gets exhausted.
4761200	4764640	You're saying you're disillusioned by my, but breaking up with Aaron.
4764640	4766720	I'm disillusioned by your divorce and that's completely unfair.
4766720	4767720	Yeah.
4767720	4768720	It's completely unfair.
4768720	4769720	I mean, you know, it's completely unfair.
4769720	4775200	Never stopping isn't a good, like I have bipolar disorder and sometimes I go really, really
4775200	4779440	fast because I get in like a manic episode and it feels really good while it's happening,
4779440	4781760	but also you got to stop sometimes.
4781760	4785760	Like right before the other poll, it isn't good for you.
4785760	4790640	That's the secret to, if you're bipolar, just do the one poll.
4791560	4792560	It's cheating.
4792560	4798480	It seems like cheating, but just fucking be like, eventually you have to, you have to
4798480	4800440	find like a middle ground.
4800440	4807360	Well, I mean, I obviously in some, in some ways I failed a lot with this experiment,
4807360	4811080	but, but, but, but in a lot of ways I did not at all.
4811080	4812080	I did not at all.
4812080	4813080	No.
4813080	4819080	Cause I thought, I mean, you were like, you're like this Tesla coil of like, you were exactly,
4819080	4820480	you're like, I fucking everything.
4820480	4825640	I nailed it tonight and I, I just wanted like some Oscar the grouch to come up and go, well,
4825640	4833320	the line was too long and the cookies had raisins, you know, and I don't like raisins
4833320	4837240	and it's dumb of me to be a control freak and think that I can like paint with human
4837240	4839160	fucking souls like that.
4839160	4845840	And I'm afraid that I'm never going to make it now because of what you just did tonight.
4845840	4848360	You think you, you just damaged something.
4848360	4849360	No.
4849360	4850360	Oh.
4850360	4854240	I, um, but, but, but like, like, I feel like I invested too much, maybe emotionally in
4854240	4855240	your show.
4855240	4856240	Into my show.
4856240	4857240	Into your show.
4857240	4859880	And into my marriage with Aaron and you're like, and you're like, if that can't work,
4859880	4860880	then why?
4860880	4861880	Cause they said it would work.
4861880	4865320	And believe me, that marriage was built on paper and mush.
4865320	4867400	It was nothing.
4867400	4874000	I was there motherfuckers, you weren't.
4874000	4879400	I remember, I remember when Aaron said where you guys had your registry.
4879400	4882720	So I sent, I sent, I bought a gift off your registry.
4882720	4886960	I never gave a name to it, but I bought a gift off your registry just to send, just
4886960	4888960	because I appreciated like what you put out.
4888960	4892280	That's why you wait a year before you buy a wedding gift.
4892280	4895280	Should I go?
4895280	4897680	No, no, please, come on.
4897680	4898680	I know.
4898680	4901160	I think, well, look, I'm glad you brought this up.
4902160	4905280	I mean, cause I, of course I'm going to think about that too.
4905280	4907840	I got married for 11 months and then I got divorced.
4907840	4910240	I'm like, what the fuck does that even mean?
4910240	4911960	I thought marriage meant something.
4911960	4918080	How could you be married for 11 months if it means something?
4918080	4924120	The fact that we never talk shit about each other, the fact that we were on the same team,
4924120	4931000	like got married, didn't find out that marriage was our best form together.
4931360	4935640	And just went, I bid you adieu.
4935640	4938440	And that we're not like stabbing each other in the face.
4938440	4942080	I think it's a, it's a, it's sorry, Spencer.
4942080	4943080	Why?
4943080	4944080	Oh, sorry.
4944080	4945080	Yeah.
4945080	4946080	I'm sorry.
4946080	4948480	I was checking my phone.
4948480	4951960	I mean, nobody, nobody gets married thinking they're going to get divorced.
4951960	4955120	And yet the divorce rate is like 85%.
4955120	4959760	And I'd like, I do think, not us, honey, not us.
4959760	4963920	I could see definitely, I've been, I've been in relationships with people when they've
4963920	4968640	gone like, we've had like weird totem couples and those people break up.
4968640	4972080	Woody Allen makes movies about that shit where it's like, oh, they broke up.
4972080	4974320	What does that mean about us?
4974320	4977960	I like fucking people.
4977960	4981120	Divorce is the fucking best thing that ever happened to mankind.
4981120	4983720	People fucking stay together.
4983720	4993240	King Mark Bergman directed this like, like six episode series called Scenes from a Marriage.
4993240	4998480	And he said the best thing that happened was after that aired, the divorce rate fucking
4998480	5002760	skyrocketed in Sweden because people weren't making each other miserable and their kids.
5002760	5003920	And divorce is great.
5003920	5009840	And we should just get the fuck off my high horse about divorce.
5009840	5012520	No, it's great.
5012520	5015480	I'm glad you guys are friends.
5015480	5017160	And it's not a sad event.
5017160	5018160	It's great.
5018160	5019160	Quit laughing.
5019160	5022280	It doesn't mean that love doesn't exist.
5022280	5025280	That's the mistake that we make.
5025280	5026280	Say what?
5026280	5030760	He said focus on science.
5030760	5031760	Focus on science.
5031760	5034600	Probably a Rick and Morty reference or something.
5034600	5037000	Are those mutually exclusive, really?
5037000	5038000	Is that where we're going?
5038000	5040200	Yeah, it's love or science.
5041200	5044080	Speaking of science, look what I discovered.
5044080	5049800	You could like do this with mics.
5049800	5052560	Have you guys been watching porn with each other, by the way?
5052560	5054040	Does this remind you of porn?
5054040	5055040	Oh, yeah.
5055040	5056040	I'm sorry.
5056040	5057040	Yeah.
5057040	5058040	Okay.
5058040	5059040	So what was your name?
5059040	5060040	Newsy?
5060040	5062200	Your name was not Newsy.
5062200	5063880	I know your name was not Newsy.
5063880	5064880	It's Sean, right?
5064880	5065880	Sean?
5065880	5066880	Right.
5066880	5067880	Yeah.
5067880	5068880	My name is Sean.
5068880	5069880	Hi, Sean.
5070560	5071560	I bullied you.
5071560	5073040	I'm rubbing off on you, I think, a little bit.
5073040	5074040	I bullied you.
5074040	5075040	It's fine.
5075040	5076040	I bullied you.
5076040	5077040	I bullied you.
5077040	5078040	He's been bullied.
5078040	5079040	Sean.
5079040	5080040	All right.
5080040	5081040	Camille?
5081040	5082040	Hi.
5082040	5083040	Stay there.
5083040	5084040	I still...
5084040	5085040	I want to break your soul.
5085040	5086040	You want to break my soul?
5086040	5087040	I'm trying to...
5087040	5088040	I keep bringing you people up and I'm like...
5088040	5089040	It's going to be hard.
5089040	5090040	People say that I'm like a Morty.
5090040	5091040	People say I have a soul.
5091040	5092040	You're pointing at your friend?
5092040	5093040	Or are you pointing at yourself?
5093040	5094040	Or are you...
5094040	5095040	I don't know.
5096040	5097040	Did you ask her up or did she just come out?
5097040	5098040	She said...
5098040	5099040	A little bit of both.
5099040	5100040	She...
5100040	5101040	I think it's...
5101040	5102040	Yeah.
5102040	5103040	What's your name?
5103040	5104040	Trisha.
5104040	5105040	Trisha?

5141120	5142120	never got to see you.
5142120	5144620	Been trying to see you for a year and a half, didn't get to.
5144620	5151280	But I finally got to come live and as I'm in line, the stepmom texts me that she's pregnant
5151280	5153160	and having another baby.
5153160	5159400	And they're buying this big gorgeous home somewhere in town and so I was like okay well
5159400	5165200	my children get to live with you, you get to have this big house and my marriage is
5165200	5166520	really bad.
5166520	5171920	So and now he's like, she and he is actually really sweet to her and he treats her really
5171920	5176440	well and I was like well that could have been my family so where's my big house and where's
5176440	5177440	my extra babies?
5177440	5178440	You feel like we kind of...
5178440	5179440	Yeah!
5179440	5180440	They stole all my thunder.

5183200	5187320	I was the before wife and now she gets like the good part of...
5187320	5188320	I think we married to Yann.
5188320	5192720	It's a gamble baby, you pulled out too soon.
5192720	5194480	Why is she texting you?
5194480	5195480	You guys have that kind of relationship?
5195480	5196480	Oh yeah, well we...

5203720	5206160	No, we get along for the most part for the kids.
5206160	5208440	You guys normally just let's play catchphrase and...
5208440	5210440	Yeah, we had a stick around as a family.
5210440	5213320	That was weird that night that she just started throwing weird shit at me.
5213320	5214720	Look how big my house is.
5214720	5218320	Yeah, well I don't think she realizes the rude things that...
5218320	5222480	Because there's random times where she's just like oh well...
5222480	5223480	She knows, she totally knows.
5223480	5224480	The girls live with me.
5224480	5225480	She ain't been called out on it yet.
5225480	5226480	No, I don't know.
5226480	5227480	I'm too nice, I am.
5227480	5231340	But like she has the weird stabs at me and we're all like well the girls live with us.
5231340	5235520	So we get to make these decisions and I'm like well I mean come on they're my kids so...
5235520	5239080	But so tonight was another thing of like look at our big giant house we're buying together.
5239080	5240440	Oh by the way I'm having another baby.
5240440	5242000	I feel like this is compatible.
5242000	5244640	So you have this like great night.
5244640	5248800	You're like Amy Poehler in Inside Out.
5248800	5251480	You're like the I'm Mr. Sunshine Pants.
5251480	5252480	Yes, exactly.
5252480	5253880	Whatever your character's name was.
5253880	5257880	And your blue blueberry butt or whatever.
5257880	5262440	I watched the movie maybe half a time it fell asleep.
5262440	5263720	Honestly I think Anomalisa should...
5263720	5264720	Yeah, we're not going to get that.
5264720	5267320	Anomalisa should have won the Golden Globe.
5267320	5271200	Honestly look if you're going to vote if you're voting if you're out there and you're
5271200	5276720	voting for the Oscars I just want to I just want to ask you if a movie takes 800 people
5276720	5281600	to make you know I mean come on how good can it be?
5281600	5284160	We only used like 113 people.
5284160	5288240	Yeah and look back into the 90s remember there was a show called fucking Herman's Head that
5288240	5289240	is the same.
5289240	5290240	Yeah, Jesus Christ.
5290240	5291240	It's such a fucking trope.
5291240	5292240	It's such an old idea.
5292240	5293240	Come on, stop.
5293240	5296240	You didn't hear that shit from me.
5297240	5298240	Fuck.
5298240	5300240	I want that Oscar, man.
5300240	5301240	All right.
5301240	5302240	Nothing's more important than the world.
5302240	5303240	Your name was Trisha.
5303240	5304240	All right.
5304240	5305240	Trisha had nothing to do with the venue.
5305240	5306240	Obviously what we've learned tonight is that this place is awesome.
5306240	5307240	This was what made me happier.
5307240	5310240	Because no one has any stories about having to wait for anything and eat anything off
5310240	5311240	of the sidewalk.
5311240	5312240	What happened while I was in line?
5312240	5313240	All right.
5313240	5314240	I didn't mean to.
5314240	5315240	Come on.
5315240	5316240	That's terrible.
5316240	5317240	That's terrible.
5317240	5318240	That's terrible.
5318240	5319240	All right.
5319240	5320240	I just want to suck some of your energy.
5320240	5321240	I'm sorry.
5321240	5322240	Any of yours.
5322240	5323240	I want to suck some of your energy into and give it to her.
5323240	5324240	That's it.
5324240	5325240	That's all I'm going to do.
5325240	5326240	Yeah.
5326240	5327240	How are you going to do that?
5327240	5328240	Done.
5328240	5329240	All right.
5329240	5331240	I just want to suck some of your energy.
5331240	5332240	I'm sorry.
5332240	5333240	Any of yours.
5333240	5338240	I want to suck some of your energy into and give it to her.
5338240	5339240	That's it.
5339240	5340240	That's all I'm going to do.
5340240	5341240	Yeah.
5341240	5342240	How are you going to do that?
5342240	5343240	Done.
5343240	5353240	What's your social security number?
5354240	5355240	That's it.
5355240	5356240	The last four numbers.
5356240	5360240	Four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, three, four, three,
5360240	5363240	two, one, four, three, two, four, three, two, three, four, three, two, six.
5363240	5365240	You're kind of close and that's actually a little scary.
5365240	5366240	Four, three, two, six.
5366240	5370240	Social security number going into this loved one right now.
5370240	5371240	Hallelujah.
5371240	5372240	Again, it was into you.
5372240	5375240	You're going to forget about all of that.
5375240	5377240	All of that man that done you wrong.
5377240	5379240	That done man done you wrong.
5379240	5382240	And now that's your happiness is leaving your head.
5382240	5385240	You're a little less happy.
5385240	5386240	You're a little less happy.
5386240	5387240	That's okay.
5387240	5388240	But you're a little more happy.
5388240	5391240	You're both just equal out.
5391240	5393240	Then we're just terrified.
5393240	5394240	All right.
5394240	5396240	Your Virgin Mary in the country.
5396240	5397240	Capitalism.
5397240	5398240	Capitalism.
5398240	5404240	Camille and Tricia, give them a big hand.
5409240	5413240	I mean, I mean, yeah, yeah, I know.
5413240	5414240	I know.
5414240	5415240	I know.
5415240	5416240	It's not your fault.
5416240	5417240	Yeah.
5417240	5418240	No.
5418240	5419240	Yes.
5419240	5420240	Go ahead.
5420240	5421240	Go leave.
5421240	5422240	Oh yeah.
5422240	5423240	Yeah.
5423240	5424240	I'm sorry.
5424240	5425240	We didn't, we didn't take any of her joy away.
5425240	5432240	It's that time where you always sing the sad version of Beethoven's poop in your butt.
5432240	5437240	No, it's, it's, it's that time when we recount the things that we've learned.
5437240	5442240	But also Spencer, it's that time where you reject Dino's way of getting out of the show.
5442240	5445240	Wasn't there a game that we were running?
5445240	5446240	We're running.
5446240	5447240	We're running.
5447240	5448240	We're running overtime.
5448240	5449240	I don't know.
5449240	5450240	Well, we don't have much time.
5450240	5451240	Isn't yet.

5470240	5472240	We owe these people a show.
5472240	5474240	He might not want to come.
5474240	5475240	Yeah.
5475240	5476240	He doesn't have to.
5476240	5477240	Who cares?
5477240	5478240	I doubt it.
5478240	5479240	He's coming.
5479240	5480240	He's coming.
5480240	5481240	I guess he's on the second floor.
5481240	5482240	No, that guy's going to the bar.
5482240	5483240	Whatever.
5483240	5487240	My name is Friedel.

5507240	5508240	What?
5508240	5509240	I couldn't hear you.

5678240	5681240	I dread the rest of the day and eventually I get out of bed.
5681240	5682240	All right.
5682240	5683240	All right.
5684240	5685240	Sorry about that.
5686240	5691240	Hey, what does everybody from here to here do?
5692240	5695240	How do you know when you're finished?
5696240	5697240	All right.
5698240	5699240	Chicago.
5700240	5701240	Come on.
5701240	5702240	This little scamp.
5703240	5704240	Who are all you people?
5705240	5706240	There's so many of you.
5707240	5708240	All right.
5709240	5710240	So, all right.
5710240	5711240	Let's do this.
5711240	5713240	Let's finish the show in the best way possible.
5714240	5716240	And it's not on me if it's bad.
5717240	5718240	Armed combat.
5722240	5726240	There are two weapons under two of those stools.
5728240	5729240	We're going to play it.
5729240	5731240	Dave's getting a head start.
5731240	5733240	We're going to play a new experimental game.
5734240	5735240	Oh, okay.
5735240	5736240	We're going to play.
5736240	5737240	Okay.
5737240	5740240	So, have you guys ever heard of a game called Super Fight?
5741240	5742240	Nope.
5742240	5743240	Yeah.
5743240	5744240	Okay.
5744240	5745240	So, here's the deal.
5745240	5746240	Have you ever played apples to apples?
5746240	5747240	Yes.
5747240	5748240	Yes.
5748240	5749240	Apples to apples.
5749240	5750240	You yell at each other.
5750240	5751240	All right.
5751240	5755240	What's going to happen is you're going to have cards that represent fighters.
5755240	5756240	Yeah.
5756240	5757240	And they're going to fight.
5757240	5760240	But you guys are going to have to apples to apples style argue why your fighter is going
5760240	5761240	to win this fight.
5761240	5762240	Does that make sense?
5762240	5763240	Yes.
5763240	5764240	Okay.
5764240	5766240	So, normally we got to get like a consensus.
5766240	5771240	But maybe we can like use the audience as like the judge of who wins.
5776240	5777240	No, they aren't.
5777240	5778240	Tina's checked out.
5779240	5780240	I was texting.
5780240	5781240	Why are we doing something?
5781240	5782240	No.
5782240	5786240	I think let's just try a two way fight between the two of you.
5786240	5787240	Oh, I'm not in it?
5787240	5788240	I don't think so.
5788240	5789240	Okay.
5789240	5791240	I'm going to go take a shit.
5794240	5795240	All right.
5795240	5801240	So, which of you guys, Dan, pick a white card and a black card and that will form your fighter.
5801240	5802240	Okay.
5802240	5804240	And then Friedel, you do the same.
5805240	5808240	We only have a bit of time.
5811240	5816240	So, these are characters and then they're going to have attributes.
5816240	5817240	All right.
5817240	5819240	And we're going to see who's winning the fight.
5819240	5821240	And you guys got to really be comedic.
5821240	5822240	Otherwise, it's not going to work.
5822240	5823240	Oh, okay.
5823240	5824240	No.
5824240	5825240	I mean, who cares?
5825240	5826240	All right.
5826240	5827240	I got mine.
5827240	5828240	All right.
5828240	5829240	I'm good.
5829240	5830240	All right.
5830240	5831240	So, Dan, you go first.
5831240	5832240	Who's your fighter?
5832240	5835240	A crocodile hunter who is a hoarder.
5835240	5836240	Okay.
5836240	5839240	A crocodile hunter who is a hoarder versus?
5839240	5843240	A queen armed with a sniper rifle.
5843240	5846240	A queen armed with a sniper rifle.
5846240	5847240	So, okay.
5847240	5852640	Who would win in a fight between a crocodile hunter who's a hoarder and a queen with a
5852640	5854240	sniper rifle?
5854240	5855240	Queen!
5855240	5857240	Well, they got to argue first.
5857240	5858240	They got to argue.
5858240	5860240	Let's hear them yell at each other.
5861240	5864240	I will bring down the monarchy on you.
5864240	5871240	I hunt crocodiles, so when I hoard, what I'm hoarding are crocodiles.
5871240	5878240	So, I'm, like, always, even when I'm at my least functional, I'm surrounded by one of
5878240	5881240	the most terrifying beasts.
5881240	5883240	I'm a queen with a sniper rifle.
5883240	5885240	I can shoot you from afar.
5885240	5888240	But you can shoot a wall of crocodiles from afar.
5888240	5889240	Yeah, true.
5889240	5891240	I will have hoarded them.
5891240	5892240	That's what you'll see.
5892240	5894240	I will have hoarded crocodiles.
5894240	5896240	I hunt and hoard crocodiles.
5896240	5898240	But they are slow moving, right?
5898240	5899240	Yeah.
5899240	5900240	They can be dead.
5900240	5903240	Their skin is thick.
5903240	5904240	Can they climb well?
5904240	5906240	Because if you have a sniper rifle.
5906240	5907240	They stack well.
5907240	5908240	Oh, yeah.
5908240	5909240	I'm hoarding them.
5909240	5913240	I'm not relying on them to do my bidding.
5913240	5914240	I'm hoarding them.
5914240	5915240	All right.
5915240	5917240	Carcasses and all.
5917240	5918240	Whatever.
5918240	5921240	I don't have any reloads on this sniper rifle.
5921240	5924240	But I imagine I could take you out from afar.
5924240	5925240	That's a good point.
5925240	5928240	I mean, you could shoot him before he unleashes the crocodiles.
5928240	5931240	He's just hiding out, watching that crocodile shed.
5931240	5938240	But I assume that this conflict is happening at a moment subsequent to me being identifiable
5938240	5940240	as a hoarder of crocodiles.
5940240	5947240	Which means that I am already fortified with crocodile flesh.
5947240	5948240	All right.
5948240	5951240	Any closing arguments?
5951240	5953240	I got nothing.
5953240	5954240	Whatever.
5954240	5956240	I got a sniper rifle.
5956240	5957240	That's not nothing.
5957240	5958240	I'm a coward.
5958240	5960240	I'm the queen and the coward.
5960240	5962240	Dan?
5962240	5963240	Closing?
5963240	5966240	I do one thing during the day.
5966240	5969240	I hunt crocodiles.
5969240	5971240	I do one thing at night.
5971240	5975240	I aggregate crocodiles by gates.
5975240	5976240	All right.
5976240	5982240	I live in a fucking cocoon of crocodile hide.
5982240	5983240	So, okay.
5983240	5985240	So let's do this by applause.
5985240	5991240	Who thinks the crocodile hunter wins?
5991240	5998240	And who thinks the queen with the sniper rifle wins?
5998240	6000240	That actually sounds kind of...
6000240	6003240	I got to give the edge to the queen with the sniper rifle.
6003240	6004240	Okay.
6004240	6006240	All right.
6006240	6014240	I feel like the sniper rifle people are just going where the boys are.
6014240	6019240	And I feel like there's a special place in hell for you if you...
6019240	6021240	So that's a fair point.
6021240	6025240	And I think a lot of people would agree with you and say that even if there's no evidence
6025240	6027240	of it whatsoever.
6027240	6028240	Let's...
6028240	6029240	Do you guys want to do another round?
6029240	6031240	We could do one more round.
6031240	6033240	All right.
6033240	6035240	Did Tino really...
6035240	6038240	Now, Dan, you pick another fighter.
6038240	6040240	All right.
6040240	6043240	So what happens now is...
6043240	6045240	We got Tino.
6045240	6049240	Now you pick another fighter who you can try and beat a queen armed with a sniper rifle.
6049240	6051240	Because that's the fight.
6051240	6052240	You see?
6052240	6053240	Okay.
6053240	6054240	You see?
6055240	6056240	Tino...
6056240	6058240	Tino, what were you doing?
6064240	6065240	He's not...
6065240	6067240	He doesn't like games.
6067240	6068240	It's okay.
6068240	6069240	All right.
6069240	6071240	I had to pick another...
6071240	6072240	Yeah, yeah.
6072240	6073240	Go for it.
6073240	6074240	Yeah.
6074240	6075240	Okay.
6075240	6076240	What is it?
6076240	6080240	Well, I'm an evil doll covered in eyes.
6081240	6082240	Okay.
6082240	6087240	So that's taken on the reigning champion of queen with a sniper rifle.
6087240	6088240	So a doll...
6088240	6090240	An evil doll?
6090240	6091240	It's what it says, yeah.
6091240	6092240	Full of eyes?
6092240	6093240	Covered in eyes.
6093240	6094240	Covered in eyes.
6094240	6095240	Covered in eyes.
6095240	6098240	So now argue about that.
6098240	6100240	You have this still.
6100240	6101240	No, you've got to keep this.
6101240	6102240	It's the winner.
6102240	6103240	Okay.
6103240	6104240	You're the winner.
6104240	6105240	You won.
6105240	6106240	I won, but...
6107240	6108240	I don't play it.
6108240	6109240	No, no.
6109240	6110240	It's all good.
6110240	6112240	You're just still being the same thing.
6112240	6113240	Okay.
6113240	6114240	Yeah, yeah.
6114240	6115240	It's like a winner, you know.
6115240	6117240	It's like real fighting.
6117240	6120240	It's like an entertaining game.
6121240	6123240	Are we still at the park west?
6123240	6125240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6126240	6129240	Well, I feel like...
6129240	6132240	My sniper rifle will crush you.
6133240	6145240	I feel like because you work on the sniper field that you are somehow accountable to evil.
6145240	6153240	And that I, as an agent of evil, can probably pull strings from above you.
6153240	6155240	He's got an evil doll card.
6156240	6157240	No cheating.
6157240	6161240	Like, aren't you, as a sniper, just a gun for hire?
6161240	6162240	Don't you just snipe?
6162240	6163240	Essentially.
6163240	6164240	Who tells you?
6164240	6165240	I'm a send wolf.
6165240	6166240	Yeah.
6166240	6167240	That's what I do.
6167240	6168240	Well, I mean, done and done.
6168240	6170240	But I'm also the queen.
6170240	6171240	I'm also the queen.
6171240	6174240	I have an entire nation behind me supporting me as a sniper.
6174240	6177240	Well, I'm covered in eyes.
6179240	6182240	And each eye is dedicated to evil.
6183240	6191240	Which, traditionally, has intelligence and articulation at its disposal.
6191240	6193240	Three minute warning.
6193240	6195240	Three minute warning.
6196240	6199240	I mean, you're a queen, but you're...
6201240	6202240	What do you mean?
6202240	6204240	No secrets.
6204240	6206240	It's a goddamn show.
6206240	6207240	No cheating.
6207240	6209240	He's asking me if he can do stuff.
6209240	6211240	I think that means I won, right?
6211240	6212240	Well, okay.
6212240	6214240	I'm an evil doll covered in eyes.
6214240	6217240	I'm going to be a queen, sniper rifle.
6217240	6218240	Sniper rifle.
6218240	6221240	Like, I make you hate yourself.
6221240	6222240	Okay.
6222240	6223240	I make you...
6223240	6226240	I see everything that you should hate and I make you hate it.
6226240	6228240	And then you fall down the stairs and you die.
6228240	6230240	It doesn't matter what you are.
6230240	6232240	I'm an evil doll covered in eyes.
6232240	6235240	I see everything.
6235240	6240240	I see your weird thoughts about all kinds of underage people.
6241240	6243240	I've seen everything.
6243240	6246240	I'm an evil doll with eyes.
6246240	6249240	I like that underage gets a new...
6249240	6251240	He didn't say sex anywhere.
6251240	6253240	No, I'm saying I see.
6253240	6254240	I see.
6254240	6255240	I've seen it.
6255240	6256240	I've seen it.
6256240	6258240	I've seen your evil.
6258240	6259240	All right.
6259240	6261240	You can see through the queen.
6261240	6263240	Let's just put it to a vote.
6263240	6266240	Evil doll covered in eyes.
6266240	6267240	Who wins?
6268240	6269240	It's good.
6274240	6275240	All right.
6275240	6277240	And a queen with a sniper rifle.
6281240	6282240	I don't know.
6282240	6284240	That was like a tie.
6284240	6286240	I think that one's a tie.
6286240	6287240	I got to say.
6287240	6288240	The lead...
6288240	6290240	One minute warning.
6290240	6291240	All right.
6291240	6295240	Rap battle about a doll with eyes.
6296240	6298240	Rap it up battle.
6298240	6299240	Who's the best rapper?
6299240	6301240	Who's the best rapper in Chicago?
6301240	6303240	You're the best rapper in Chicago?
6303240	6304240	All right.
6304240	6306240	All right.
6306240	6308240	We need a beatboxer.
6308240	6310240	Or we can trade off if you want to trade off.
6310240	6311240	Trade off?
6311240	6312240	Yeah.
6312240	6313240	Let's just do it.
6313240	6314240	Am I going to beatbox?
6314240	6315240	You want to start?
6315240	6316240	I'll beatbox for you.
6316240	6318240	I'm going to start a unit.
6318240	6320240	However you're comfortable.
6320240	6321240	Oh.
6321240	6322240	Oh, shit.
6322240	6323240	Oh.
6323240	6324240	Oh.
6324240	6325240	Oh, shit.
6325240	6326240	Oh.
6326240	6327240	Yo.
6327240	6328240	Yo.
6328240	6329240	Yo.
6329240	6330240	Yo.
6330240	6332240	To the mic comes the king of mics.
6332240	6334240	My name is Dan Harmon.
6334240	6335240	Psych.
6335240	6336240	My name is Daniel.
6336240	6337240	Last name Harmonious.
6337240	6341240	I fucked your mama and I was felonious.
6341240	6343240	That means I stole her pussy.
6343240	6348240	I fucked your mama so hard your daddy came in shushy.
6348240	6353240	That's a new adjective that means he was like going shush.
6353240	6354240	Shush.
6354240	6355240	Yeah.
6355240	6356240	He was.
6356240	6357240	Shush.
6357240	6358240	You know that.
