0	17760	Oh, yeah! Yeah! How's everybody doing tonight? Yeah! My name's Rob Schrava. I'm comptroller
17760	24880	tonight. Who cares? You care. Thank you very much. Welcome to the Dynasty typewriter that
24880	31200	we are going to be doing. Harmontown is now in session! Let's give it up for our Dungeon
31200	41600	Master, Spencer Crittenton. Looking so nice tonight. How you doing Spencer? I'm good.
41600	52800	Oh, man. It's been a while. Has it? Now, let's give it up for the mayor of Harmontown,
53920	64080	Dan Harmontown! Look at him! Yeah! Thank you. Thank you very much.
64080	69840	From the bottom of my hip to the hop to the hippity heart.
71120	80560	Damn. Back in the day, I used to fuck your mama in a belly. And I used to milk her like a cow.
84800	88960	All right. Sorry. We don't want to... Thank you very much. You got a little deal in there. I
88960	96640	used to fuck her. Like a cow. Like a cow. I fucked your mama. I was talking about my
96640	101440	UTI backstage and Rob was like... You used to be represented by them.
106560	113920	It's true. Yeah, it's true. 20 years. Urinary talent.
113920	121920	That's international. Yeah. I'm talking about my UTI and
122560	127280	Strav's like squinting at me and listening and then like in between sentences he goes,
128160	133920	you're going to be low energy tonight. Well, I haven't been around for a while. I want to
133920	142720	make it worth my while. Yeah, we're here to serve. That's good. It'll be worth my while.
143360	148000	You having a fun time working on my show? Don't you know?
149680	152880	Sometimes I'm not there. I went on vacation for a week. You were in there.
153760	157520	I mean, I did already ask you off stage. I'm just asking you in front of people.
157520	160640	Yeah, I'm having a great time. All right. It's a great show.
162080	169360	Spencer. Hey, Dan. Do you like what I'm doing on the show? This one or the Rick and Morty?
169360	174240	The Rick and Morty show. Am I pulling my weight? I think so. You don't weigh that much.
177840	185600	I'm on that noon till eight fast. Have you heard of this? It's a new fast
185600	192000	where you only eat from noon till 8 p.m. Really? That's not enough stuff. Intermittent fasting?
192000	196720	What's that? You're talking about intermittent fasting? Why is it intermittent? It's intermittent
196720	204000	because fasting would mean you aren't eating at all. See, Dan? Yeah. This is weird for two
204000	207840	reasons. First of all, breakfast, fast is right in the name. I've never understand that. Oh, well,
207840	212000	it means breaking the fast probably. Of the evening. From sleeping online. All right.
212000	217600	But this is now in a world where I'm rarely surprised anymore about these new dietary fads.
217600	224800	This is the one I really thought they'd never... Breakfast now is out. The most important meal
224800	228400	of the day? The one that sets your metabolism? You know that the breakfast is the most important
228400	235920	meal of the day is a marketing slogan invented to sell bacon. Yep. All right. Okay. Yep. Just
235920	243200	bacon? Just bacon. It turns out that people weren't liking all these lean cuts of pork.
243200	246880	And they were like, let's make all this fatty pork. And no one knew what bacon was. No one wanted
246880	251840	bacon. Oh, wow. Also then they were making the lean cuts of pork because like fat, people were like,
251840	258480	fat. Oh no, not fat. We got to have carbs and shit. And then so they're like, but bacon. And then
258480	262560	that got people into bacon. And then they're like bacon. And that's where bacon culture came from,
262560	267760	was just trying to sell this shitty scraps of pork that weren't selling as lean. Yep.
267760	272480	It's funny, the idea of me being disappointed to find out where bacon culture came from. Yeah.
272480	278320	Like there's a purer place. In a world where... I thought farmers made it up around the breakfast
278320	284800	table and handed it down like pagans. In a world where Coke invented Santa Claus. Right.
288080	292480	And I like that stuff. I just wish that we wouldn't ruin it by then taking it too seriously. That's
292480	300400	what Campbell always said. He's like, all ceremony is great. He was a Catholic choir boy. He was
300400	304080	into the Boy Scouts. He loved ceremony. He loved ritual. He thought it was so important.
305040	310480	You know, Campbell recommended that he's like, you know, in a lot of the more grounded tribal
310480	315760	societies that we can still observe today, they maintain this thing where if you make it to middle
315760	321040	age, there's a point where you should change your name. Doesn't that sound organic? Yeah, that does.
321040	325840	And when Cody proposed to me and she was like, you know, she put Dan Heller on the ring. I'm like,
325840	330320	I think I'm going to commit to that. Not because I respect women, but because I hate myself. Yeah.
330320	334000	And like, I never really thought about it because they really, you've probably been noticing. I've
334000	340560	been kind of like a real lugubrious snook, you know, in this show. I hate you in the show. I hate
340560	346800	myself. It's myself I hate. I don't hate you guys. It would definitely cut down on the Google like
346800	352960	trauma. Yeah. It's like it's both simultaneously, it hits the chicken shit spot. But for like this
352960	359680	noble, exciting reason, doesn't Daniel Heller sound like a writer? Sure. Partially because there's
359680	366320	Heller's the famous writer, but how about Danny? Danny? Well, okay. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna,
366320	371200	I'm not gonna poo poo that. Danny Elizabeth Heller. But I think, I think the mistake that I made
371200	375760	when I was in eighth grade, I started, I would hit, you know, those puberty hormones. I started
375760	380480	going like, don't call me, stop calling me Daniel. Call me Dan. I thought that was such a manly move.
381520	386960	No offense to Dan's out there. I'm one of you, but it was just like, I was already a Daniel and I
386960	392640	threw that shit away. I had this amazing biblical name that was like steeped in blood and fucking
392640	398320	like conquering and like through your art, you know, like, like the story of Daniel is such a
398320	403840	great one. Yeah. Daniel in the lion's den. Yeah. Yeah. He was an interpreter of dreams and then
403840	409840	like his competitors were like, let's catch him being a Jew or whatever. And they, they like, they
409840	416480	ratted him out and then, uh, uh, or a Christian. I don't even know what, I don't even know which
416480	421600	Bible the Daniel story is in. I think it's Old Testament, right? It's a Hebrew name, but, uh,
421600	429200	so, so I, I can't remember. I saw veggie tales about it. Hell yeah. And, uh, is he played by a
429200	435920	carrot? Yeah, sure. I, I eat it. And then I read the, the actual story in whatever Bible it was.
435920	440080	And it was like, wow, this is like, they, yeah, they, they, they threw him in the den. And, but
440080	445600	then the God was like, fuck you. And then, but then, and then it was like, uh, uh, all of the
445600	450720	people who betrayed him and conspired against him, I think all of them and all of their families got
450720	455920	thrown in the lion's den. They live that part on a veggie tales, even though they're vegetables.
455920	461440	So lions eating them wouldn't even be, it would be good for them. I wonder if the lions were, uh,
461440	466880	vegetables. Did the lions killed the family? Oh yeah. They couldn't, they couldn't spread
466880	472640	that miracle. No. I mean, if, if, if God made the lions not eat the, uh, families of the betrayers,
472640	476800	then only thing God would be succeeding and demonstrating would be like people would just
476800	481520	euthanize the lions ago. These lions are worn out. Right. Yeah, that's true. God was like, nope,
481520	488320	flip the script. Those lions are eating non-Christians. Non-Christians, sure. I guess
488320	494320	it was like, Daniel was like, uh, he got this gig, like, like the, as basically the king's
494320	499760	therapist and the, it wasn't a Christian empire and the king would say, Hey, Daniel, I had this
499760	504080	dream. Can you interpret it? And Daniel would basically take every dream and interpret it as
504080	509680	like, sounds like you should be Christian. And the king was like nibbling on that hook. And that's
509680	513920	why his peeps were like, we gotta get rid of this Daniel. They fucked with the wrong guy.
513920	520880	So what did God, God, God put the lion and made the lion sleep. He, yeah, he shut their mouths.
520880	526240	He shut their mouths. He shut the lion's mouth. Yeah. He said, shut your mouth. And they,
526240	530560	and then he's, and then Daniel fell asleep too. And they woke up and then like the guards woke up.
530560	533680	He probably pretended to be asleep just to like show off. Yeah, the guards the next morning going,
533680	539520	oh, we better clean up all that blood and stuff. Oh, what's up guys? Can I have late check out?
539520	545920	Hey, that guy's sleeping with the lions. All right. Anyways, but, uh, I would name myself
545920	553600	lugubrious. Are you, are you a, are you a, uh, an Imperial bounty hunter? Yeah. I'm certainly like,
553600	562000	uh, a wizarding bureaucrat. Okay. Uh, so, uh, tell me about the bees. Let me tell you that these bees.
562800	569280	So some start from the start from, I interrupted you starting to tell you to start from the
569280	575280	beginning. Some, some portion of time ago, I was in Dan's backyard, you know, just snooping around
575280	582400	looking for clues. And, um, I'm noticing, man, there's some bees. There's not like a lot of bees,
582400	589200	but there's bees. And normally you see like a B, you know, two bees. Didn't think about it. Uh,
589200	595040	fast forward to, uh, these dudes doing stuff in Dan's house. They're putting wires places and such
595040	600400	and they're like, Oh, there's a beehive in this wall. And we can't, we can't put cords through
600400	606240	the wall because the bees. And, uh, I was like, Oh, that explains those bees I saw. And so then
606240	611120	I started trying to figure out how to deal with the bees. I called a bee company, a bee guy estimate
611120	616400	came by. He's like, here's what we do. We, we open up the wall, we get out the bees, we close up the
616400	622000	wall, bing, bang, boom, sounds great. We'll come next Thursday. And I'm like next Thursday. How about
622000	626320	this Thursday? And they're like, eh. And then, so I was like, okay, I'll see what I could do.
626320	631360	And, um, so I'm looking around for a different bee guy, found a different bee guy. And then I was
631360	636480	like, okay, we got a bee guy to give us an estimate, but we need a bee guy to come this Thursday,
636480	641440	this Friday, something like that. Can you do that? And they're like, yeah. And so then, um,
641440	645920	we make the appointment. Then like two hours late, the bee guy calls me. He's like, I'm on my way.
645920	651440	And then a half hour later he shows up and, um, then he's not prepared to do the job. He just
651440	655360	tells me what the last estimate guy told me. I'm like, yeah, no, I know. That's why I called you.
655360	660000	You said you would be able to take care of the bees. You can't. And, um, so he's like, yeah, yeah,
660000	666480	I'll come back. I'll come back on Monday. He comes back on Monday. Um, I see the guy. Oh,
666480	670480	one of the things he says, like, oh, they're in this wall. I've got to break open the wall.
670480	675120	But man, if that wall is made with cinder blocks, like the only thing walls are made out of,
676000	682160	um, that's going to be a problem. And I'm like, it is. That seems like that's the whole job. Really?
682800	686880	We didn't know it was made out of cinder blocks, but I was like, I think it's a cinder block wall.
686880	691520	It is outdoors. And that's like, and then you look at these walls, they're cinder block walls.
691520	696320	Looks like a cinder block wall. You know, it's about the thickness of a cinder block. Um,
696320	701040	and so, but he's like, yeah, I could do it. And then, so he comes back. He comes back today,
701520	707600	uh, again, two hours late and, um, not two hours, like not, they give you a two hour window and
707600	713040	it's at the end of the two hours window, two hours after the end of the window. And, um,
713040	723200	I see this guy and he's not carrying like, uh, a giant drill or a Jack hammer or like a handheld
723200	727680	impact hammer, any of these things that I would expect to be necessary to take out a wall. And
727760	731840	then I'm starting to understand this is why cinder block walls would pose a problem because
731840	738480	he's not prepared to deal with what those are. And, um, he's, does he have, oh, so he had nothing.
738480	744640	He had a B smoker, a B smoker. Yeah. I'm like, that's not going to do the job. Um, and, uh,
745920	751680	he starts gathering up dried leaves from your yard to put the B smoker didn't even bring his
751680	756080	own smoke. He didn't even have like smoke chips or whatever the fuck liquid smoke. I don't know
756080	763280	how it works. Um, but so he, so he doesn't have wall opening tools. And, um, so he comes and looks
763280	765920	at the wall and he's like, I'm going to have to open the wall. And I was like, yeah, that's what
765920	769840	you said last time. That's what I told you over the phone before you showed up in the first place.
769840	775760	Anyway, he goes back to his car and he comes back with a drill and a hammer, just like not even a
775760	783280	big hammer, like a normal sized hammer. And like, I think we're done here. Um, but, uh, he, he gets
783280	787840	at it and, um, and I'm watching because he, he starts smoking the bees. The bees are getting
787840	792160	pissed, which, I mean, he, the bees get pissed before he starts smoking. I think he was hitting
792160	796640	the wall with a hammer and you could hear how ineffective the hammer was being on the wall
797440	800400	because it doesn't sound like anything's happening. It just sounds like if you hit
800400	808720	the sidewalk with a hammer, you know, um, and, and so, and so the plan is to pound the walls of the
808720	814800	bees home with a hammer that demonstrates its fortitude. Right. And then when they come out to
814800	820400	kill him, he's going to start up the smoker with the, uh, with the homegrown leaves in it.
820400	824160	And he wasn't aiming the smoker. I don't, I didn't, I think the smoker had a spout,
824160	828480	kind of like a tea kettle, like a camping tea kettle, but he didn't like have it aim that way.
828480	832720	He just had it like above the area. So it was like an incense stick, just kind of burning the
832720	837440	general vicinity of outdoors. Um, like I would have poured, tried to pour smoke into the hole
837520	842560	and then hit the hole with a hammer or something. Who knows? Anyway. Um, so then he pulls out his
842560	848560	drill. It's a, it's a cordless drill, which don't have a ton of, uh, I mean, there's cordless drills
848560	852240	have come a long way. Don't get me wrong, but it did not look like the cordless drill that had a
852240	858000	lot of, uh, uh, horsepower to it. So I could hear him. He's drilling a hole in the wall to try and
858000	863040	break it open to try and get something that he could stab a hammer into or something. And I could
863040	869600	hear the drill, either running out of batteries or reaching the limit of its, you know, power work.
869600	874800	Yeah. Torque capabilities. And I'm like, yeah, no, this is, this is definitely what I was expecting.
874800	878560	I mean, not what I was expecting initially. Like when he showed up, I was like, this is just,
878560	884320	this is a, just a disaster. And, um, so then he, he tries for a while and he's like, yeah,
884320	888640	I can't get the wall open. I'm like, yeah, you don't say. And, um, he's like, well, what do you
888640	893520	want to do? You could kill the bees. And I'm like, yeah, no, that was always on the table.
893520	898560	That's not what I was going for. Um, I could have killed the bees. Um, I don't even need a
898560	905760	apiarist outfit. Um, but so eventually we, uh, we, uh, he was, you know, I was like, you gotta get
905760	909440	someone, you need a jackhammer to open it. And I was like, yeah, that's why I was so surprised
909440	914960	that you did a bring one. And, um, then, uh, you know, I don't know, I was like, okay, so it sounds
915040	919280	like I'm going to have to do is find someone who can open the wall. Then when that happens,
919280	924320	we'll get you back in. You know, I'm just trying to make him feel better. And, um, then we'll see
924320	927840	about, we'll see about actually solving the problem. And if I can't get someone to open the wall,
927840	933200	we'll, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll spit a bunch of bleach in there or something. And, um,
933200	937440	with your mouth. Yeah. With my mouth, the number one,
938240	943760	don't swallow it. You might cure your autism. It's a little joke for our UK listeners.
944720	948800	My mom was, I was talking to my mom the other day and she's like, you know, I hear if you, uh,
948800	954720	dilute bleach, it's good for your health. And I was like, no, no, no, get off the internet.
956800	961600	Like a big thing in the UK there. Like, like it's, it's, man, it's just awful. What are you
961600	970080	talking about? It's like, we're, we're in our 30th, 40th, 50th year of mistreating autism and kids.
970080	973760	Um, even though we know what it is now, very good at diagnosing it, but
975520	979360	the more parents know what it is, the more they just like don't want their kids to have autism.
979360	985360	Like, like, so, so like, you know, in the seventies they were, they were cattle prodding kids into,
985360	988880	into like, you know, you cattle prod an autistic kid enough.
988880	993760	If they're, depending on where they are in the spectrum, you can train them to hug. Um,
994640	999040	it's just, it's just fucking brutal, man. Like, like late seventies, this was happening in the
999040	1002880	United States. And, uh, like, like, and people knowing that the kids, it wasn't like they didn't
1002880	1007440	know the kids were autistic. It's like, that was, that was the big treatment for autism was this guy
1007440	1013760	was like a guru. It's like zapping kids to make them hug their parents. And anyways, but in the
1013760	1019600	UK now, because we've evolved so much, um, there, there, yeah, there's now there's a new like wave
1019600	1025680	of guru, like somebody that's like, just, just, just, uh, younger, the better. Just give them a little,
1026320	1030880	little British cup of bleach, just a little bleach drinks it. And you know how many ounces are in
1030880	1036000	those? Cleans out all those, uh, vaccines that those fucking doctors filled them with, you know,
1036000	1041120	get those vaccines out of there with the bleach and then, uh, and then, and then go outside and
1041120	1049840	enjoy that sweet flat earth. Just roll forever or don't roll forever. No, no, God, I'm sorry.
1049840	1054000	No, that's what, that's what those idiots think. You can roll forever. I don't just roll, roll
1054000	1059600	very carefully around outside you, depending on where you are. And people are actually drinking
1059600	1066240	bleach. They're making kids, making kids drinking. Yeah. The kids, the, yeah. If the, if the, if the
1066240	1071840	kids, isn't that killing? Yeah. Back in my day, telling someone to drink bleach was just telling
1071840	1075760	them to kill themselves. Right. I'm sure they're diluting it, but what they're, yeah, what they're
1075760	1081360	doing is they're stripping the esophageal mucus membranes, probably, uh, probably permanently
1081360	1087280	damaging the kids in their developmental stages. So they'll be autistic. And, uh, you know, when
1087280	1094480	they learn at the age where they, you usually already learn everyone's an idiot. Imagine these
1094480	1100480	poor kids is like, why can't I breathe? Oh, you're a fucking idiot. That's horrible. And you tried to
1100480	1108640	make me hug you by poisoning me. I, why am I like, like, you know, autistic people invented the
1108640	1113440	internet. Like the next generation of autistic people are just going to all be Lex Luther. They're
1113440	1119120	all going to kill us. They're going to be like, I can't blame them. I want to go blame them.
1119120	1125040	SPD says autistic people are meant to create the virtual reality of the future. And that's why they
1125040	1132000	exist. Well, that's, that's fully, yeah. I love SPD's, um, uh, uh, evolutionary, uh, futurism
1132000	1137120	theories and stuff. Um, let's bring them up and have them talk about it. Is he here? Are you here?
1137120	1144320	SPD. I heard someone say, yeah, man, but I'm sorry. Ryan Kraus, host of a cold case murder mystery
1144320	1153600	files is here with us. Damn. Oh, okay. Hey, hey, I guess it was really him saying, Hey, so welcome
1153600	1162640	to the show. Welcome to the show. Talking to it'll be on at some point. Hey, welcome. Hey, so you
1162640	1168320	were, you, you ghosted us. You were, you were in the, I was stalking you. You were stalking us.
1168320	1174400	You were in the writer's room all day, huh? Pretty cool, huh? Hollywood. Great experience.
1175840	1182640	Got to sit with Hollywood in a room, right? Yeah. What was that like? Did you like it? I think I was
1183760	1191360	this far from you. That's too close. Uh, yeah. How was that experience without
1191840	1198240	spoiling anything? Yeah. I mean, uh, great that enjoyed watching you do your work and, um,
1198240	1203360	everybody talking beforehand. It was amazing. Yeah. I like this little shadow program. As long
1203360	1206720	as the writers don't mind it, like there's a, there's a table and then there's a whole couch
1206720	1212320	area that we're not using anyway. Yeah. Sit there and listen to us. As long as it's someone I trust,
1212320	1218240	that's not going to, you know, like, like you're going to hear like beyond spoilers. I mean,
1218320	1223760	you're going to hear spoilers that we, yeah, I mean, uh, but, uh, you want to, what, what
1223760	1232800	spoilers did you hear today? Oh, let's see the people's basketball court. Yeah. Don't tell him
1232800	1238640	what we're going to do. Yeah. I mean, I can't talk about that. Uh, yeah, I think I'm going to have,
1238640	1244240	uh, I'm trying to coordinate and maybe it's just tell him to come into whenever he wants now.
1245120	1251120	But, uh, John Singleton's, uh, kid Masai who also graduated from USC is kind of following his dad's
1251120	1257200	footsteps. Uh, he, like the last conversation I had with his dad was about how his kid was
1257200	1263200	so into Rick and Morty and like wanted to know more about writing TV. And, uh, I want, I want to,
1263200	1268400	I want to get him in there to, uh, I don't, I feel like we're not, it's, it's just like this,
1269120	1272800	this story I've babbled about this before, but the craft of story breaking,
1273920	1280560	it's, it seems like such a waste that even I, I still feel like I'm doing it for the first time
1280560	1286240	every time because it's like, but it's like, there's no, like, we need to like record and like,
1286800	1292640	you know, figure out, there needs to be like a time life book for breaking stories,
1293520	1300640	uh, you know, at some point so that we can stop wasting time and like keep evolving.
1302000	1305280	But it's like, you sit in a room and you're like, oh, how come this doesn't feel like an episode of
1305280	1311360	small wonder yet? And then you talk for six hours, like what if small wonder had a, an STD? And then
1311360	1314800	you're like, like, oh, we got it. We got it. Now that sounds like an episode of small wonder, but
1314800	1319360	what you're not doing is, I mean, it's like, if, if you, if you, yeah, look, I've said this before,
1319360	1323520	but it's like, if you're a carpenter and you go like, okay, this is called a joist. We figured
1323520	1328320	this out. This has a function. It holds a certain amount of weight. It's you use it this way. Like
1328320	1332720	this is, you put this in at 90 degrees and stuff, then you write it down and carpenters don't have
1332720	1337360	to fucking, every time they build a house, go like, huh, how do I, you want to contain people?
1337360	1342080	I do that joist. Yeah. And then they have to reinvent the joist. That's what writers have
1342080	1347840	been doing in TV writers rooms for basically 60 years is, is, is every single season of every,
1348160	1355200	in almost every episode, they reinvent the story joist. And that includes me because I just kind of,
1355200	1361600	and I, I, I took photos of every like whiteboard when we would work on community. I'm sure those
1361600	1366640	are around somewhere in some digital box. I always wanted to do like a, a book or something that would
1366640	1373360	like try to, try to figure this out. Just, just so that it, so that the subsequent generation can
1373360	1381680	be like, okay, so our goal isn't joists. That doesn't make us, uh, uh, uh, Frank Lloyd Wright,
1381680	1388480	like that's just architecture 101. Like let's, let's finish that. Let's deconstruct it. It's
1388480	1395760	reconstructed. It's done. It's geometry foundations, basic shit. And then, so let's, let's use those
1395760	1403360	principles to either a, you know, once you understand them, you can then defy them. So I'm
1403360	1408800	not a pedant. I'm not, I've been like, Oh, so that they always know what to do. But like, also you
1408800	1414080	can just, it's like, okay, we understand chords now. So let's write a song. I don't know. Well,
1414080	1418800	I mean, there's, I'm sure there is an answer to this question, but hearing all that there are
1418800	1425200	books on screenwriting. So what don't those do to formalize the process to the extent you're talking
1425200	1430160	about? Well, they don't, um, I don't know of any books. Um, and I'm sure there are some, but I
1430160	1437200	don't know of any books that are basically like more like manuals for collaborative, um, uh, and,
1437200	1446400	um, uh, mass produced, like no bullshit, like televisual TV writers rooms, basically that,
1446400	1453280	gee, I wonder why there aren't books that were sold 900 copies by now. Um, but, but, but I also
1453280	1459840	think that the principles that we, you would, if you tried to write a textbook for TV writers rooms
1459840	1465600	on how to break stories that I believe that the principles they're in would make everybody better
1465600	1472560	at everything. No, I'd agree. Um, because really it's like at the core of it is everything that
1472560	1476480	I do wrong when I try to write by myself, I'm doing, because I'm not talking to other people
1476480	1480240	and then everything I'm doing wrong when I'm working with other writers, everything that's
1480960	1486720	that's being done right or wrong is happening verbally and, you know, in an exchange between
1486720	1492320	people. But that's what makes that place the right place to MRI the process because, Oh,
1493440	1498400	we have transcripts from the writer's assistant. We have, we have results. We have, we have things
1498400	1504960	going from idea to episode. That's why I'm so like, I've, I've been like screaming and pulling
1504960	1509280	my hair out about the, the development of interactive right whiteboard technology.
1509280	1514480	Cause it's like we have the technology, but no one makes it cause there's no specific
1514480	1519040	like need for the, for the exact technology that a writer's room would need.
1520160	1525280	Um, but it's like, if we had that 10 years ago, you'd now have 10 years on a hard drive of
1525280	1531440	community story breaking and stuff, including like McKenna and Gans and, and Andrew guests,
1531440	1536720	like working on multiple story circles for like every character in the, in the, in the,
1537200	1543440	in the dice episode, I'm a big fan of my work and I, I just think it should be stored for all time.
1543440	1548240	I mean, I'm getting ready to retire here. You guys are gonna, can we, can we throw
1548240	1552560	on Gandalf had to fight that ball rock? Can we, can we throw it out? Imagine if he bought a house
1552560	1559760	instead of like coming back and the cleaner robe, can we throw out some cold case files? Okay. Yeah.
1559760	1562400	Sorry. I don't know what got me on that. Oh, it's cause you were in the room today,
1562400	1566720	which I was thrilled about cause you're such a smart guy and, uh, you expressed interest in it
1566720	1570080	and I trust you implicitly had dinner with you. Yeah. You were on the show and I was like,
1570080	1576320	this guy's definitely not going to run into the street and go Beth is a clone. Um,
1578080	1584800	the, uh, you'll see, she's a meeceats. Um,
1585120	1592400	um, evil mortimator out of a clone box. Uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, but, but, but also
1592400	1598400	like, I, I do, I think that, uh, I don't want to make people hate you by saying this, but I do
1598400	1603600	think that a lot of people already do. It's fine. Like who, like who hates you? Have you ever been
1603600	1609840	getting, I mean, do you get hate mail? Oh, definitely. Hey, you should say that. Stop
1609840	1616160	doing that. Do you ever get that? I get those from people who pay to listen to my podcast. Yeah.
1616160	1620480	I have a lot of hate lists. What's, what's like the worst, like, Hey, you should stop.
1621200	1627680	Like what was like in that area? Like, uh, I think there was one person who left a review for me on
1627680	1634960	apple podcast. This suggested one of my episodes was going to lead a lot of people to commit
1634960	1642240	suicide. Yeah. Which episode do you remember? The Jamison family. So there's a, it's a mystery
1642240	1646720	where this family in Oakland, I think it was Oklahoma, uh, drove off into the wilderness
1646720	1651760	in a pickup truck. They've been behaving very strangely beforehand and it was on camera. And
1651760	1657360	so, uh, no one really knows if they succumbed to mental illness and it was a murder suicide
1657360	1663520	or if they were stopped somewhere and murdered. And you know, I suggested that I thought based upon
1663520	1670000	their behavior prior to leaving that they actually were involved in a murder suicide.
1670000	1675040	And so this person just took it from there. When you say they were acting strangely,
1675040	1680240	what, what do you mean? What were they, uh, they have, there's this video of them, um,
1680240	1687120	packing their vehicle and it's just, it's just really, you know, something you have to check out,
1687120	1693600	but, uh, they kind of look like Sims. Yeah. I mean, it almost, it almost looks like they're
1693600	1698800	robots. I mean, you don't see any emotion. It doesn't look like they're interacting in any way
1698800	1706320	whatsoever. They're packing for a trip, but there's, it's just this very monotonous, uh, movement that
1706320	1713920	just doesn't actually lead to anything involving emotion, I guess. And behind the scenes, they
1713920	1721440	already, they, they were expressing in what ways, um, like they felt like they were in the midst of
1721440	1726880	some supernatural grip or something where, how do we know that about them before they died? Yeah.
1726880	1731360	Well, they made a lot of suggestions, uh, to people at their church. Oh, so that didn't go
1731360	1737200	over very well. Church, churchy folk. Yeah. See, that's, that's a good reason not to be religious.
1737200	1742640	If, if there's fucking demons in your actual life and you tell people at, at, at Hardee's,
1742640	1747520	oh, at Hardee's was a restaurant. What am I doing? Um, if you tell people you were, you know,
1747520	1751120	it's like, like anywhere, but church, like a church, they're probably just like, oh, yeah,
1751120	1756880	just don't just drink more fluids. And I was like, no, man, you got to tell people that you're being
1756880	1761920	haunted by demons. Like you get the right treatment. Even if that's demonology, I don't care. But like
1761920	1766080	you got to tell somebody other than your congregation, they're not going to give a shit. Well,
1766080	1770720	that was essentially the things they were, they were looking for a gun because they had some sort
1770800	1776720	of a problem with a demon or something like that. And, and, and pastor, I probably don't have to ask
1777280	1784960	a special, special bullets. I assume demon bullets. Well, they did get the gun and strangely they
1784960	1790480	found a hole in the skull of the father's head when they found the remains. Um, so we don't know
1790480	1795200	if that's a bullet hole, but it could be, this is what confused me about it. When I was listening
1795200	1800640	from what I remember of your episode is that there was, but there was, um, the, the, the gun
1800640	1807120	was not there, right? No, they didn't find the gun. No. When they, when they first searched for
1807120	1813280	the bodies, they didn't find anything in that area. And then the skeletons were out wide open,
1813280	1818800	just sitting there. I mean, for anyone to see at a later point. So it's believed that they might
1818800	1823280	have been moved, but they could have just missed it. I thought they were laid like kind of, they,
1823280	1828640	they weren't laid flat. They were, they were, they were, they were huddled next to each other.
1828640	1832160	Okay. And so I don't know if they were how flat they were, but they were huddled right next to me.
1832160	1835520	I mean, this is one that you did not solve. Correct. I mean, you were just like, you know,
1835520	1839360	it's, I mean, I would lean toward a murder suicide because of their behavior before.
1839360	1844480	How can you, you can't do murder suicide without, you're saying like a coyote came and took the
1844480	1850640	gun or, or, or whoever moved the bodies. Somebody maybe found the gun. I would take a gun from a
1850640	1857680	bunch of dead bodies. Yeah. I mean, what, what a comment. Well, I don't have a gun and they're not
1857680	1862480	using it. That that's actually, I would probably tell the police over like, I'm taking this gun,
1862480	1866960	but I found it off a bunch of dead bodies. You don't even want to be, by the way, you didn't even
1866960	1872240	want a gun from a gun store. You, you're not going to take one from the absolute billboard for
1872880	1877360	non-gun. Absolutely would. It's like, it's earned. If you find it on a quest,
1877360	1883040	like you'd be silly not to take it from a bunch of skeletons. I mean,
1883040	1891040	I probably would have defeated the skeletons first. Um, go on. Sorry. You got it. Yeah. Sorry.
1893680	1898080	Cause obviously it goes without saying you can't, but if he thought they're afflicted by a demon,
1898080	1902240	he might've thought that was the only way to stop the demon was to kill it while I was possessing
1902240	1905840	his family. Or, you know, he might've been delusional enough to think that he was possessed
1905840	1909760	by the demon. And so he might be taken by violence and then realize what he'd done.
1909760	1913920	But were there only holes in, in his head or everybody's head?
1915040	1919440	No, they just found a hole in his head. But what was interesting is that there was a very
1919440	1924720	large envelope of cash underneath the seat in his truck. So if it had been foul play,
1924720	1929440	it stands to reason that somebody probably would have looked for his truck or not. I mean, but I
1929440	1934720	would assume you would, I don't know, assuming that the, that the, the money was the motivator
1934720	1939520	for the foul play and that they knew about the money, which they would have probably because
1939520	1944960	they were driving around ostensibly looking for property and saying they had the cash to buy it.
1944960	1950240	So Occam's razor would say, if it was foul play, it would be related to someone who
1950240	1955040	heard they had a bunch of cash. Right. And the cash wouldn't have been found in such a simple
1955040	1959280	location. But also just like killing someone is a dangerous thing. So if you're not going to get
1959280	1963440	anything from it, you know, and there's stuff that you might even, you might just look. And the
1963440	1968160	money was not like in a hidden Han Solo compartment. It was like where, if you were
1968160	1974160	willing to kill, you would be willing to look, which was under the seat of their car. Uh,
1974160	1977760	and it's not like deliverance where there was like a hut nearby where people lived that might
1977760	1982640	have killed them just because killing's fun. That's been suggested as well. But I mean,
1982640	1986880	they think that the truck might've been moved from the last place that the father drove it,
1986880	1990880	but we just don't know. That one's just creepy, man. There's video footage of them like what,
1990880	1995840	like just loading up their car. How many, how many family members? So, uh, just three,
1995840	2000320	I think it was the three and they're all, they're all in on it. How old were the kids?
2000320	2004240	Uh, I forget. I think it was just one. I think they just had a daughter. I can't recall.
2004960	2009200	Yeah. It's, it's terrible. Cause I mean, we're, you know, I'm cracking, cracking, cracking funnies,
2009200	2014000	but like there's victims here. I mean, and they weren't, it's not like the heaven's gate thing.
2014000	2017920	And there's victims there too. If they believed they were going to get in a flying saucer, but,
2017920	2022960	but like, I mean, you're a dependent in your family and you end up regardless of what
2022960	2028880	combination of murder, suicide it was. She's a victim. And, uh, I mean, I just like, it's like,
2030560	2037200	supernatural theories aside, that makes me really upset to think that she was so captive,
2037200	2042640	for instance, that she was that, that she's like loading a car that she possibly knows.
2043520	2049600	But you're, but you, you talked about how they didn't think, whatever. Listen to the episode.
2049600	2056080	Will you? Um, I, you, you did it. You did like a four or five hour one on this, on this, uh,
2056080	2061920	this dude who like wanted to commit quantum suicide. Oh yeah. That was pretty crazy. And
2061920	2068320	you were, you, you, you hooked into a little bit of a Dan Harmon story circle of magic there.
2068400	2073200	I appreciated that. That's not why I like you. I'm not a, I'm not a flattery person.
2073200	2079520	What is a quantum, what is a quantum suicide? So the quantum suicide, the idea is that you're
2079520	2084800	going to commit suicide. Yeah. But when you die in this world, you're going to transcend to another,
2084800	2088320	right? Where you made a better decision and you have a better existence forward.
2089120	2093920	Didn't work out too well. He hit the ground. So he, so the idea is like, he's going to
2094880	2100320	kill himself to go to a better place. Yeah. I was going to jump off a cliff to go to a better place.
2100320	2107440	The ground. Yeah. That's what happened. But he lived, he chose to jump off of, was like 30 feet.
2107440	2112160	Oof. So it was like, like, like, like when Batman drops, uh, uh,
2112880	2118960	Falcone off of the, you know, things like, Hey, pick a better spot. It was like, yeah,
2118960	2122800	that's the idea. Like it was like, it was like a fall. That was like, looked like it was guaranteed
2122880	2128160	to just like horribly injure you. If you fell off of it, that's fucked up with Batman. Yeah.
2130800	2138480	Yeah. You know, he used to use a gun. Did he ever? Yeah. He shot, he shot some people before.
2138480	2143280	And then it's like, Batman doesn't use guns. Wait, what, what, like in the comic book or?
2143280	2146800	Yeah. Yeah. No, he used to have a, you know, back in the olden days when he wasn't very well
2146800	2150640	established, you just sometimes shoot people. A guy with ears on his hat that would show up at
2150640	2159040	crime scenes. Yeah. I'm sure. Yeah. I love that. That's how Batman started. I'm a detective.
2159040	2167200	What did, what, what were they called? What did it, the gun shoot? Just bat let's bat little.
2168320	2171520	That's why he's, that's why he stopped using it because of the, the, the
2173680	2178720	I'm going to fill you full of Batlets. What? I don't think he was that lit. I don't know
2178720	2182960	if he even had like the batarang or anything back then. It was just capping people,
2182960	2188320	just running around. He used like a regular. So he's just a maniac shooting people. Oh yeah.
2188320	2191920	Imagine being a cop and there's this guy that keeps showing up and he's wearing a trench coat
2191920	2197360	and he's dressed like a bat and he's like, I can help. Stop shooting people. Jesus,
2197360	2202800	just take off the, what are you doing? You're a detective. Do you have any Batman stories?
2202800	2211840	No. Oh, okay. Well, you gotta ask. That's how we find out things.
2215840	2220160	Let's see here. Can you solve the case of these bees in my backyard?
2222720	2226560	I don't know about that. What's going on with the bees? We should shoot them with your gun.
2226800	2232640	That'd be amazing if he broke open the wall and the bees started attacking him,
2232640	2238560	but then the coyotes came and saved him. Well, they're like the Eagles from war of the rings.
2239760	2243920	Yeah. The coyotes haven't been a problem, huh? I got kind of a money pit situation brewing over
2244720	2249360	at my old house. Oh man. Yeah. Sorry. I was just getting excited about the money pit.
2249360	2255760	You guys know about the money pit, the Shelly long movie. Uh, I not, I mean,
2255760	2260000	maybe it was inspired by the money pit, but the money pit's like a real physical thing.
2261120	2267040	It's a real pit. Okay. You guys go. Okay. There's these, there's this island where they,
2267040	2271520	like someone was convinced that there's treasure there and they started digging down, but the whole
2271520	2277120	kept filling up with water. And then, then, uh, they, it became a money pit because they spent like,
2277680	2282640	they spent multiple fortunes and businesses went bankrupt for generations trying to like get to the
2282640	2287360	bottom of this money pit. And they never really found anybody, anything. They eventually got this
2287360	2291760	giant drill and the giant drill drilled through a bunch of layers of shit and like drilled through
2291760	2296240	a bunch of silver. So it probably just punched through whatever silver cash was down there or
2296240	2301600	whatever, but they never really got it. Anyway, I think I know how, how to solve the money pit,
2301600	2308240	but it's too late now. So let's just move on. No, the money pit, it's like it was sunk with water,
2308240	2313280	but presumably whoever actually like created it had a, had a solution to get there. And there was
2313280	2318000	these giant boulders that were found off the island. And I think that there was these secret
2318000	2322320	water channels that were covered by dirt. But if you knew where they were, you were supposed to put
2322320	2327120	the boulders on top of it and that would stop the water from pouring in. And then you could just dig
2327120	2330720	through it without it being flooded all the time. But one of the first things they did was just
2330720	2335120	excavate the shit out of one of these water channels. So it just absolutely couldn't be
2335120	2342400	plugged. And then from then on, it was just done, son, the money pit. What do you think was down
2342400	2347120	there? It was just like silver. I don't even think it was that much, but it was cool to the people
2347120	2350960	who like had a whole lifetime to do shit. You know, back like when there was like, yeah, let's
2350960	2355680	build a pyramid. That seems like the use of time. They found it. They found fragments of silver
2355680	2359760	through the drill because they were just kind of like drilling down and seeing what they found.
2359760	2363680	And there was like a pretty thin layer of silver. Then at the very bottom, there was these huge
2363680	2367840	subterranean caverns that didn't seem to have anything of value. And I think those were flooded
2367840	2374320	too. Spencer knows so much stuff. And it's all useless. No, no. The other day I call them up
2374320	2383280	and I go, why do pirates wear patches over their eyes? Why do pirates wear patches over their eyes?
2383280	2386560	That's a good question. Why do they wear them over their eyes? Because I thought,
2386560	2391600	oh, it's because they've lost their eye and it looks gross. But then I was like, well,
2391600	2396000	these right. Exactly. It's more intimidating. They're supposed to be badasses. Oh, I just,
2396000	2400640	I don't want you to see how it's really icky underneath. So I'm going to put this over there
2400640	2404960	just so when we're talking face to face, I don't, you know, gross you out. I'm kind of embarrassed
2404960	2408240	about it. So I'm going to cover it up. I was like, Oh, you guys are supposed to be tough.
2408240	2413440	But then I called my friend Spencer. And just to be clear, I might be wrong about this. I was going
2413440	2419120	off of memory. Yeah. But this, this makes this, this tracks for me. So let's just make it history.
2419120	2431440	Sure. Don't at me. What are you going to say? You should say it. No, no, no. I'm done. I don't
2431440	2435920	want to talk. I said, don't add me to the people on Twitter who are going to tell me that's not why
2435920	2443520	pirates had batches. Yeah. Well, you know, just to keep airborne infections out of the, no, no,
2443520	2450320	Spencer, go ahead. You're so much better at it. No. Okay. So what I told shrub was that I think
2450320	2454480	for one, pirates were superstitious. So I think that they believe stuff. Like I think one of the
2454480	2458400	reasons they wore earrings was because they just thought that made them hear better. They had
2458400	2463360	superstitions of all of that. And I think that I patches were, were part of that to the extent
2463360	2468000	that I think they sometimes just wore them as a superstition. The other thing, um, what was the
2468000	2472960	other thing I said, the other thing was like, they thought back then, if you squinted, if you,
2472960	2478640	if you had one eye open, it would see stronger or whatever squinting both eyes,
2478640	2483280	squinting both eyes. Instead of doing this, you just like had one eye completely close.
2483280	2487600	And then you could do that. And that's why Popeye is like, like this, right? Because he's a sailor
2487600	2494160	man. And also like you were saying, like, because it's like bright lights outside during the day,
2494160	2498480	and then you go below deck, your eye has to adjust or whatever. You know, when you go below deck,
2498480	2503360	but if you have like this, you can, you flip it up, you flip it up and compensate it. And,
2503360	2509200	and it's done today as a joke where, Oh, there's, there's nothing wrong with your eye,
2509200	2514000	but it's actually, Oh, you're saying these, these guys didn't, I was sorry. They didn't lose their
2514800	2520320	eye. Some of them, I mean, they were wearing them for like weird cyborg reasons. Like they thought
2520320	2524720	they were super powering themselves. Yeah. Like it was like, like, it's like a fingerless glove.
2524720	2530320	It's like a piece of equipment, a nautical, like road warrior. Now you're getting it. Yeah. Yeah.
2530320	2534720	You're catching on. Huh? Yeah. But also I think I said that, you know, they didn't have good
2534720	2540560	antiseptic technology back then. So it probably did, you know, help the technology of antiseptic
2541280	2546960	wasn't as, it was urine. They used urine. Yeah. Yeah. They used, they used urine. Damn. Don't
2546960	2553760	use my urine for antiseptic. Some shit in there that'll fuck you up. I don't know what the hell's
2553760	2558800	going on with me. My dick, I don't know what you're talking about. That sounds good. I haven't seen
2558800	2563760	you in a while and, and, and I think you look very healthy. You've lost some weight. Your skin is
2563760	2569200	good. I got the lab results from my got a haircut, cleaned up your active liver, prostate, everything's
2569200	2574000	great. You're wearing a belt. I don't even know. I already talked about this. I think I was pretty
2574000	2579440	drunk last time, but I assume I talked about this. My vitamin D levels are stabilized. I was a,
2579440	2583920	you know, how'd you do that? Are you taking vitamins? I just took a couple. Okay. I didn't
2583920	2589120	even take that many. I usually forget to take them. I hear, I hear mushrooms are good, but a
2589120	2596640	little vitamin D goes a long way. Isn't that right? Yeah. Do you have any vitamin D? I'm in perfect
2596640	2601360	health. I get this results from my regular Beverly Hills doctor and then I get this burning
2601360	2608480	cock and like weird. Does it hurt right now? What, right now? It's not, it's like, it feels like I
2608480	2616480	have a, uh, it feels like I just jerked off an hour ago. Uh-huh. I kind of did. Um, that, that
2616480	2620640	track, that makes sense. And then I didn't pee afterwards. Like it feels like there's like maybe
2620960	2628080	something I, like I, sorry, I was going to say, sorry, ladies, sorry, everyone. I go to like,
2628080	2634400	like the, the, like the men are like, no, tell us more about your dick. And the women are like,
2634400	2641120	only me, only, I don't want to hear this. Um, it's probably the opposite, right? The women are like,
2641120	2647520	tell them what's going on. What is with you people? Um, uh, anyways, but, uh, it feels,
2647520	2652960	it just feels like, no, it's there's no pain. It, it, it, it, certain positions. Like if I put
2652960	2657040	pressure on a certain foot or something and sitting, is it the problem? Like you're not,
2657040	2662000	right now, fine. No, it's just like random positions. I think there's something in my bladder
2662640	2669280	that is floating around and maybe is like, and you don't know where you got this from
2670960	2675680	a toilet seat. Maybe. Wait, you don't know. You honestly don't know where you got this.
2675760	2679920	What do you mean? How do you know where you got a UTI? Like, what do you mean? Well,
2679920	2684880	I'm saying we got a detective here. We could probably. Oh, should we do a 911 call? Yeah.
2684880	2689920	We give it, we give him, if we give him some facts, maybe we could, you know, you know,
2689920	2694720	back into where you got this thing so you could prevent it. And maybe some listeners out there
2694720	2701040	prevent it from happening to them or you again. I don't know what I did. Cody's convinced is,
2701040	2705280	you know, she's like, she's like, okay, now will you shower? Not just after workouts. Like,
2705280	2710560	will you just, you know, she's not, she doesn't, you know, have you ever gotten a UTI before? No.
2710560	2715680	Okay. So, well, you, you don't shower a lot. So it doesn't, I know, but as you get older,
2715680	2720160	I'm sure your immune system goes down. Whatever. I mean, I got to shower every day. When did you
2720160	2725760	first start getting the, and, and, and jump in anytime with any detective questions. Yeah.
2726960	2734480	So, okay. I'm going to figure this out. Okay. All right. So when did you first start
2734480	2742880	feeling UTI in your, in your dick? Like several weeks ago. Several service before going to
2742880	2748480	Disneyland. It was because I went to the doctor because I didn't want to have to worry about my
2748480	2753520	crotch during the vacation. Cause you were going to do some. But the confusing thing is that I also,
2755120	2759520	I didn't diagnose it as anything. I didn't tell that doctor there's something wrong with my
2759520	2767200	PP tract because I didn't know that's what was going on. I simultaneously, I think I put a little
2767200	2773040	strain on one of my groin muscles or something. So you got to, you got like a tinge in your taint
2773040	2780080	from doing leg lifts a little too hard. I work out like a fucking, I've seen it. Yeah. I've seen
2780080	2787760	it. I blast my glutes. That's what you want to do to them. I'll blast you. I'll blast anybody's
2787760	2795680	glutes after the show. Well, your glutes blasted. This is a unisex things, non-binary. I'll blast
2795680	2802400	your glutes. Everyone's got glutes. I'm a blaster. So you're blasting glutes, you're blasting glutes,
2802400	2806160	you're blasting glutes, you're blasting glutes. So anyways, and I had this, like, I kind of like,
2806160	2810320	I think I pulled my taint or something. The doctor was kind of like, there's names for those muscles
2810320	2816000	anyways. So, so in the meantime, at the exact same time around the time, I'm like, I feel this little
2816320	2824640	bitty tinge in like the tippy tip of my weenis. And I'm assuming I'm going like, you did something
2824640	2837360	with your taint while you're doing leg lifts and benching. I bench like 135. That's 245 plates,
2837360	2844960	right? One on each side? Yeah. I could lift whoever plays Minnie Mouse at the Disney park.
2845600	2850240	Easily. Without the costume. Whoever's in there seems like they're probably about 35.
2850240	2855680	Okay. So you're blasting taint, you're blasting taint, you're blasting taint. All of a sudden,
2855680	2861520	you get up and you're like, oh, there's a little twinge. Yeah. And so, and so I'm associating that
2861520	2866160	with the tip of the penis thing, right? Cause I'm like, you ever like poke your belly button too
2866160	2869680	hard? And then you're like, Ooh, that's like a nerve ending that shoots to the tip of your dick.
2869680	2874240	Cause that's your insights. Yeah. I don't know if everyone has that or not, but like I,
2874240	2880880	a belly button. Does anybody here have like belly button? Okay. Yeah. No, that, that happened.
2880880	2884400	That sounds like just basically everybody. Okay. Yeah. You don't go digging around in there like
2884400	2888000	real hard. Cause then it was like, like there's a nerve that goes like to the tip of your wiener,
2888000	2891440	right? Yeah. Okay. So, so that's kind of, it was like, it was like, I was kind of feeling that.
2891440	2895360	I was like, whatever's going on down there, first of all, I got to figure I got to make sure it's
2895360	2900240	not cancer. Cause I'm not going to sit here. And you didn't think you just pulled your,
2900240	2904080	you thought it was exactly what I thought. I went to the doctor. I said, I think it probably just
2904080	2908000	pulled a muscle while I was working out, but will you please stick your finger up my asshole
2908000	2914960	and feel my balls in that order, just smear it all over. And, uh, that, and then all of a sudden
2914960	2922640	I got a UTI and I don't know how now, uh, uh, he, he checked my balls. My doctor keeps saying
2922640	2927120	something like, uh, do you remember? I'm sorry. My doctor's checked my balls a couple of times
2927120	2932560	and I, he, every time he does, he says, uh, I told you the story about how one time I actually
2932560	2940560	caught myself like reaching up for my nipple. Like, like, what? It wasn't cause I was turned
2940560	2946480	out. It was just like, I, I felt like I felt my balls being touched and I just like, I was like,
2946480	2953120	whoa, can you put a pin in that? Can you put a pin in that? Put a pin in that, put a pin in that
2953120	2958960	because I, okay. When I, uh, every, when my doctor, my doctor's like just a guy my age is great. I
2959200	2964800	I'm a great doctor. And he, he, but he, I know it was like, he's checked my balls at least. Like,
2964800	2970320	I think it was like the third time I'm a middle aged man. You check, check, check yourself. Um,
2970320	2976720	and I, he says, he says like, he kind of like emphasizes how easy it is to check every time he
2976720	2981120	does it. And I kind of like think subtextually what he's saying is stop making me touch your balls.
2981120	2985520	That's like when you go to the vet and they're like, you know, you can express their anal glands
2985520	2998400	at home. It's like, I know I can. Like I said before, it's all you gotta do is just,
2999120	3004160	it's just feel here and here and here and that's all there is to it. Nope. And I'm like, yeah,
3004160	3009440	you're doing great. I'm not touching those fucking things. You want me to,
3009520	3016320	you know, I'm going to start rubbing my nipples right here. I went to get my, my, uh, my balls
3016320	3024640	and, and, and I need to finger up the butt procedure. It was like one early, it was an
3024640	3033040	early morning in March. It was like cold and I'm sitting there and my doctor comes in, Dr.
3033040	3044320	Rose, Logan Rose, and he's, uh, Lord Rose, Logan Rose, Logan Rose, Dr. Logan Rose. Exactly. Yeah.
3044320	3051200	And he's like this, this older African-American gentleman with long dreadlocks and, and he's just
3051200	3057120	like very, he's a great doctor. He comes in and it's, it's like cold. So, you know, and I'm, you
3057120	3063440	know, in the gown and I'm sitting there like all by myself and he's like, okay, now it's time to
3063440	3069120	do the procedure. And I turn around and his hands are, and he's like, I'm sorry, my hands are really
3069120	3073840	cold and they're freezing. And I start laughing and he's laughing and we're just, he's like,
3077920	3082400	and he's laughing. Is this on your balls or your butthole? Both. Wait,
3083040	3089840	the same time. And he's just like, I'm sorry, my hands are, he, he says it. He, he touches,
3089840	3096560	he touches my balls and I go, and then he starts, he goes, he backs up. He's like, I'm sorry,
3096560	3101840	my hands are really cold. I'm like, it's okay. Just keep going. And we start laughing at this
3101840	3110080	situation. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He says, no, it's okay. It's okay.
3110080	3114960	Like, you're fine. You're like this and I'm, we're just like, and they're laughing. And then I,
3114960	3120080	and it's because you're fine. Okay. Here's whatever's assigned this piece of paper. And he left and I
3120080	3127520	got dressed and I went out and Ryan Ridley was in the waiting room and he was going in to see
3128080	3134240	the same doctor to have the same procedure. And I said, hey, I warmed him up for you. Go
3136080	3137120	enjoy yourself.
3140720	3143200	That would be funny. Even if his hands weren't cold,
3144000	3148000	warmed them up for him, but you literally warmed him up and you gave him your hot balls and your
3148000	3154160	ass. And like his hands are now ready to go. What are you doing here? Well, you know, it's that time
3154160	3163040	of the year and we're that age. So have at it, son. 60,000 miles. You ever like, when you go into a
3163040	3168320	public restroom, I'm not, I'm not a germaphobe about public restrooms. I think it's disgusting
3169120	3176560	when the seats are visibly anything like, but provided there's no visible anything on the seat,
3176560	3182640	if you ever like, you know, and nobody wants to like, nobody wants to contact each other or,
3182640	3187120	you know, like, like we'd all prefer if when we went to the bathroom and nobody else was involved
3187120	3191600	or that there was just that the timing worked for everybody so that everyone had their privacy.
3191600	3199440	But, uh, uh, you know, nature of the beast, sometimes the storyboard artists is just coming
3199440	3205280	out. You're going in. Have you ever like, the seats like nice and clean? Like you sit down and
3205280	3211040	take a poop and it's like the seats all warm. And you're kind of like, I made eye contact with the
3211040	3217440	man who right now I'm so grateful for. Oh, a lot of people really don't like that because you like
3217440	3224000	it. I'm like, I'm like, I, it's a weird duality thing where I'm like, I'm like, ah, gross. But
3224000	3229920	like with a big smile on my face, cause it's like, like it's only intellectually gross. It's physically
3229920	3235200	comforting. Yeah. It's a heated toilet seat. I mean, it's only if you think about why that it's
3235200	3240320	like grosser, then you kind of like, you're like, boy, this species, you know, the Rick and Morty
3241120	3249360	toilet needs to, there needs to be something because there's like, how many employees do you
3249360	3253360	have? You don't even know. I think it's a human rights violation. And there's, and then there's
3253360	3261120	like one urinal and two toilets. And then when squash games moves in, there's going to be double.
3261120	3266080	It's like so much waiting. It's worse than the old building, which you were never at the old
3266080	3271280	building. We were, we just kept going, well, we're gonna go to a new building. The old building,
3271280	3275920	everybody had to be given. I have to shit on the third floor. That's what I have to go down in the
3275920	3283200	elevator to go shit in the first, because it's just, you know, in the afternoon, when you, when
3283200	3289920	you get the, when you get the after lunch, after lunch, ready to go after lunch bubble. Yeah. You
3289920	3298000	know, reverse PES baby. Yeah. You gotta go there, have a little privacy. Yeah. So you can, because
3298000	3303040	otherwise you're just, there's no, I'm dancing around the issue. Oh yeah. We don't want to be
3303040	3308640	a gross podcast. No, we don't want to be a gross podcast. We're classy. I don't, I'm just saying
3310160	3315840	it's embarrassing. Cause you're saying like, cause you could, you could like, okay. Can I tell you
3316320	3322160	we all know what we're doing in the stall, right? I mean, come on, let's be adults here. Yeah. So if
3322160	3329360	you hear something, we're reading scripts, right? Okay. But then you make all right. Go ahead. Go
3329360	3337840	ahead. What? No, go ahead. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, go ahead. You wanted him to have energy.
3337840	3344160	Just go. I just, I was making like toots, man. All right. Yeah. It's the worst. Yeah. And then
3344160	3348720	you open the door and then there's the new show runner, you know, and it's like, huh, that's what
3348720	3352320	it sounds like. All these guys, like everyone knows what my shoes look like. And like, you know,
3352320	3359440	what's worse about that bathroom? It's arguable that the two stalls, cause there was one stall
3359440	3363440	in the old building, one urinal one stall. And then it's like, everyone had to poop on different
3363440	3370240	floors. The, uh, now there's two stalls, one urinal. I think it's worse. Here's why. First stall
3370240	3378720	stall, handicap stall, whatever we call it now. Uh, handicap, proud stall, super, super, super power
3378720	3385040	stall. I don't know. I, I, I, uh, free speech zone. It's the one you're not supposed to use. If you
3385040	3390000	have, if both are available, I've never heard it. I've recently heard about this. I thought you could
3390000	3395040	just use it for forever. And then now I'm hearing like, it's like a root thing to do fast lane.
3395040	3398640	Well, just on the off chance. No, I get the logic. It makes perfect sense.
3399200	3407280	But, but, but, but, you know, so the door on that stall has resting locked face.
3408720	3417280	You can't tell if anyone's in there without pushing on it. Right. Which is everyone's nightmare.
3417280	3422160	If they're in there. Yeah. All the more I imagine if they're differently abled,
3422160	3426320	like, but everyone's differently abled when they're pooping. Don't, don't quote me on that.
3427280	3429520	Episode title. Don't use that as the title.
3431520	3434240	That's because it's going to sound, people are going to still see the title and they go,
3434240	3439120	oh, he's Jordan Peterson about it. Like handicap stalls, you know, everyone's differently abled
3439120	3446720	when they're pooping. If you think about it, like, and subscribe. Um, the, uh, I've never watched any
3446720	3452160	of his videos. I'm sure you can't, you didn't get his voice. He has a, he has like a Kermit.
3452240	3458880	So you gotta like go in there and like, like big bad wolf on somebody, some little piggies poop
3458880	3465360	session. And then once you've done that, so now they hate you. So if they're in there,
3465360	3468160	now you're like rattle, rattle, and they're, and they're like,
3471040	3474240	read the room. Like they're just going to sit there and be quiet. They're not going to go
3475200	3477360	I'm always like, sorry buddy, almost
3484640	3485600	make them feel bad.
3487600	3491280	You mean, so you mean it's like, you're like, you're almost done. You're like close, but no
3491280	3498320	cigar. No, I do mean I'm almost done. Even if I'm not, but here's another 100% of the shots.
3499280	3506400	Oh, here's another thing. The, the non, uh, differently abled stall, the small stall,
3506400	3512400	the small stall. It doesn't lock. No, it doesn't lock. It doesn't look that one. You got to hook
3512400	3518400	your foot under the door. Yeah. Lift with your strained groin until the bolt mechanism will
3518400	3524240	slide in. So now you're rattling everything that took me a week to figure out that until Brandon
3524240	3528480	told me these are the cinder block walls. These are the, all the walls are just shaking. So the
3528480	3533040	person, if they're, if it's their first poop in this building, they're going like, who is this
3533040	3539520	maniac? He better poop nice and quiet, or I'm going to judge him by his new balances.
3540960	3545440	When we go back out there and I'm drawing his fucking dumb ideas that he's going to change in
3545440	3551600	a week. If those shoes walk by me, I'm going to, I'm going to throw, I'm going to spill,
3551600	3557440	spill the tea in the fucking, uh, break room. I'll tell you that Dan Harmon's a shaky pooper.
3557440	3564240	He's loud too. There's no break room. You know, we're all working for a fucking loud pooping maniac.
3570080	3575440	It's just awful, you know, and I'll tell you what's worse than that. Do it. Like I went to
3575440	3582720	Dino's house for a fried chicken on a Sunday. So sidebar, cause we like to give you a little bit
3582720	3589280	of good news in these podcasts. Uh, if you crush pork rinds and use those in lieu of, uh, uh,
3589280	3597920	toilet paper crumbs, zero carb fried chicken. All right, go, go, gotta be with you.
3599120	3603440	It's not, it's, you know, it's probably not healthy, but it's just zero carbs. There's no
3603440	3607920	bread. It's a fucking pork rinds. What do we think of this? You could crush up the pork rinds,
3607920	3614000	put a roll of chicken in them and fry that for God's sake. Tasted great. Uh, so then
3615680	3623360	time to, time to do it. Another guy goes in Dino's bathroom. I'm like, oh, he had the,
3623920	3631360	he had the right idea. Dino goes, I got two bathrooms. No, you don't. You live in a PO box.
3632320	3640000	The guest house, like there's kids in there. It's a guest house to a PO box. It's a tiny,
3640000	3645360	tiny, tiny, it's a bird house. And there's a TV in it where usually if the people got kids,
3645360	3651440	the kids will go in there and they'll watch like fucking Peppa pig or whatever. That show,
3651440	3658080	that show fucking sucks. I watched, I watched it for like two hours with my, uh, soon to be niece
3658640	3661120	for the Disneyland trip. Did I, did I talk about this when I was
3662080	3670480	not to me. Have you seen this fucking thing? Dino's no Peppa pig, you know, the pigs,
3670480	3675520	they're all of their heads are drawn identically. Like if you asked a six year old to draw a penis
3675520	3681040	as fast as they could, that's what all the pigs, their heads are dicks and balls.
3681520	3685440	Yeah. Yeah.
3685440	3690080	But I think there's satanic magic happening with that show. Cause the, the three year old,
3690080	3694320	she like, she loves Peppa pig. So I wanted to be a good uncle, get on her good side. I'm like,
3694320	3698240	maybe we'll watch Peppa pigs. She's like, I want to sleep with aunt Cody and uncle duty bear.
3698240	3704800	That's what they call me. Why? I kind of came up with it. Cause I knew if I had a nickname that,
3704800	3709600	when we had, we had walkie talkies in the desert and I'm like, I'm an interloper. I'm an outsider.
3709680	3713840	Okay. I gotta, I gotta be fun, you know, and I'm not a naturally fun person
3714480	3718000	and I don't want to put any energy into being fun. What if I had a fun name?
3718000	3725360	Well, you can't just name yourself walkie talkies. I was just like breaker breaker. This is a,
3725360	3731120	and it gave it like an improvisational sound. I was like, this is a doo doo bear. Oh boy.
3731120	3734240	They think they've, you know, they're hacking the system, calling me that. I'm like,
3735120	3741920	you've been manipulated. I'm Ronald McDonald, a zero effort. I'm like a fucking star.
3743760	3750160	I might have kids. I didn't know how easy it was anyways. So, so, so, so, so,
3752480	3757760	so Dino goes, I go, I go, I'm not going to shit in the tiny guest house where the kids
3757840	3763360	lay in the, in the, in the fold out bed and watch a TV. And Dino goes, it's just Finn.
3764000	3770800	That's IO's kid, ex-girlfriend of mine. He's like, how old do you think Finn is? He's like eight or
3770800	3777120	something. I never met him. He's sentient, but it's just him. You know, as we're kind of like,
3777120	3783600	yeah, he's like a, he's kind of like the feral kid in road warrior. He's really smart, but he's just
3783600	3790160	like, he's like an animal person. And, uh, I mean like, like in a good way. Like we just, we make
3790160	3796080	fun of him. It's like, you know, bad mothering. Bad mothering. No, I'm kidding. Okay. But he's,
3796080	3800240	he's laying there. He's watching some two things zoned out, but this is like, I walked in and I'm
3800240	3805680	like 46 year old man. I walk in, I got to walk past him. There's this tiny little bathroom. The
3805680	3810560	whole place is like six cubic feet. He's watching Peppa Pig. He's watching. He's watching. I don't
3810560	3817600	know what he's watching. I'm too, like watching some garbage that kids think is, you know,
3817600	3823600	writers. Yeah. Like some fucking time, time warriors or some shit. Time writers. And, uh,
3823600	3830320	uh, so I get, I get, I get to the bathroom door. Just like this thin sliding door.
3831440	3836400	Do you say anything to him or you just, because I was like, what am I doing? I stopped and I
3836400	3842080	paused. I'm like, why are you pausing? And then I like turned around and he's like sitting there.
3842080	3847440	There's like long haired eight year old California kid, like glassy eyed watching his goddamn
3847440	3852880	fucking robots or whatever. And, uh, and he, and then he looks at me and I go,
3855040	3864640	I'm going to take a huge dump. And, uh, and I go in and that's exactly what I did.
3865440	3869440	But it was loud. So I like ran the sink, but I'm like, that fooling anybody.
3870240	3873840	What do you think? He thinks you're like washing your hands for an hour.
3875280	3882480	I ran it anyway. Like, you know, they wipe my ass, they wash my hands, they fucking finish up.
3883920	3890160	Check, check the Instagram. Got a lot of likes. They, uh, come out of the thing and go,
3890240	3898800	and I give him a thumbs up. And, uh, and he, look, I could lie at this point in the story and say
3898800	3905360	that he said anything so that he deserved this, but it was really just my own shame. It just,
3905360	3910480	he was just kind of like, like an eye roll. And I, and I, and I, and then I, and I got all the
3910480	3924720	way to the exit door and I was like, yeah, well I have a car. What did he do then? I don't,
3924720	3930400	I'm not going to fucking stick around. They call that the, uh, the wit of the staircase in French.
3931040	3936080	You know, I came up with a comeback on the way out. I was like, well, get out of here.
3936080	3941600	He's going to fucking slay me if I stick around. Cause he'll be like, who cares? I won't have a
3941600	3951360	comeback for that. Nope. Like I took a big shit. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. Judge it. I fucking,
3951360	3957440	I've kissed girls. That would have been better. I, I, I have beer in my fridge.
3958080	3962720	I can't even pronounce. I don't know. You fucking ate. Good luck.
3962720	3965440	You're fucking eight would have been good.
3967440	3971760	Here's a, here's a, here's a couple tips for you, uh, buddy, grow gills.
3974320	3983040	What? That's a pretty heavy carbon footprint. Uh, exactly. Uh, grow gill. Yeah. Yeah.
3983040	3986720	Cause I ain't leaving him any ice caps. You know what I'm saying? I thought it was related to the
3986720	3997200	shit. No. Grow gills. Cause that's gonna start overflowing in a second. Cause of the girths of
3997200	4002800	my stool better grow some gills. I wasn't bragging about my big shit. It was just like, I kind of
4002800	4008880	just, if it was an adult, there's a thing is if it was an adult, I wouldn't have shit in there.
4008880	4014000	Cause I'd be like, well, no one wants shit. So you would have went in there. You would have
4014000	4019760	closed the door and just sat there for a couple of minutes. I've done this. So cause it was a kid,
4019760	4024400	I felt like, well, the kid's getting like, he's getting like abused, you know, he mistreated.
4024400	4028800	Like it's like, he doesn't have power. He's like where the only TV is. So I was like,
4029520	4033840	I was like, all right, well, at least, at least I can do is level with them.
4033840	4039600	I'm going to take a big shit. That was my thought process. I'm like, I don't like being part of the,
4040320	4045680	the elder hierarchy. You know, it's like, oh, you're eight. You can't vote for fuck off. Like
4045680	4052640	that's, you know, yeah, you try to respect these people a little bit. Like, Hey, big poop coming.
4053920	4059360	I don't know if you want to just like prepare for it or you're going to hear some shit. Like it's
4059360	4063280	fucked up. Like if you were 40, I wouldn't do it. But if you're 40, you wouldn't be watching
4063280	4068800	fucking stupid ass hologram dinosaurs, whatever, saving teddy bears, fucking idiot.
4069760	4078720	What is this shit? What are you watching? It's dumb. How do you know when you're finished?
4081520	4087360	You're giving him shit. You're watching this animated hologram robot show.
4089120	4094000	Your show has some holograms and robots and happens to be animated.
4094800	4096560	I think I've seen a teddy bear in it. Yeah.
4096960	4100880	And you kind of kind of leave it. Can you send somebody? Come on.
4100880	4103120	Oh yeah. No, no ice, no ice thingy.
4104080	4109120	Levy, bring the ice thingy. I mean, if I, if I leave this stage, this show will go
4109680	4115600	right into the, right into the dumpster. I run a tight ship. All right. So, uh,
4118080	4123600	thanks, Levy. So isn't there any more? Thank you. I think he's sick.
4124560	4131440	Isn't there more to quantum suicide than, uh, than just because what you're describing is
4131440	4138240	just religion. He thought he was going to die and by dying, I get it now. So he wasn't going,
4138240	4144160	Oh, I hate my life. I'm going to kill myself. He goes, um, I'm okay. But what if I was taller
4144160	4150960	and then jumped off a cliff? Well, he thought he was getting out of the matrix. Like he thought he
4150960	4155760	was breaking through. He found a hack, right? He felt like it was almost like a creepy pasta
4155760	4161040	ritual or something because he brought his pets. Yeah. He brought it. He brought some caged animals.
4161040	4164880	He brought it. Yeah. No, you wouldn't like it. He left them out there in the freezing cold,
4164880	4170240	like in our carriers. Yeah, it was bad. No, he's a Dick. Well, he's dead. You'll be happy to know.
4170240	4177120	I am. Um, but it's, it is the, as one of the craziest stories in a genre of that is just
4177120	4185520	riddled with WTFs and, and OMGs. Yeah. I think he had a psychotic break and he, uh, he, uh, he,
4185520	4190960	he like, he like invited this girl that wasn't even his girlfriend. It was like they had dated
4190960	4200400	then they're warm. They're not. I call it a Moby. Um, he had talked to her a little bit.
4200400	4207040	I wouldn't, anyway, the day there's applause from the, from the Moby's got it bad enough. What
4207040	4212720	are we doing? What am I trying to like, what was my white knighting Moby? He's like, everyone's
4212720	4217520	just drowning in the same pool. I'm like shoving his head under. Like that's, like, that's, like
4217520	4224320	that's going to keep me safe. I already got me one and a half. All right. Okay. I only have to get me
4224560	4229120	one and a half. Uh, fucking idiot.
4233600	4239920	So he dated a lady and then, then, then, then he stopped dating a lady and he invited her out.
4239920	4248080	So you want to do something cool. You want to supervise my suicide. Um, he had made sure to
4248080	4253840	leave her. Like it was clear to her that when he died, she was going to get some money.
4253840	4260560	Yeah. It was $180,000, I think. Um, but your theory based on the various
4260560	4269360	clues, uh, is that he always fully intended for her to do it with him. And, uh, and then he was,
4269360	4277760	he knew he, he could only lure anyone out. Even, I mean, he, yeah, he, he could, he, he, he, he,
4277760	4283120	the only way he could get someone to attend his suicide was to bribe them, especially if your
4283120	4286960	plan is for them to join. Yeah. I mean, it was, it was, that was the amount of money it was going
4286960	4291520	to take to be able to manipulate her through the process of that ritual all the way to the end. So
4291520	4296160	he basically like grabbed her hand on the way down, right? Yeah. I mean, so basically the whole way
4296160	4302240	he's telling, he's taking her farther and farther through it, um, knowing that he has the leverage
4302240	4306800	of the money because otherwise he's asking her to do some very crazy things and there's no benefit
4306800	4313520	to her whatsoever. She wasn't suicidal, but she had a knife, which put a pin in why, but, um,
4313520	4318160	well, it came from his apartment. So we assume he brought it. It was like, it was like ostensibly
4318160	4323200	like, Oh, I'll bring that knife. Cause then if I jump, it's weird though, that he would be planning
4323200	4328160	for the jump to be unsuccessful. If I don't, if I don't, if the jump doesn't finish me, I'll
4328160	4332800	start stabbing myself. I mean, yeah. Well, I think, I think the part of that is the fact that he's
4332800	4337600	trying to solve an emotional problem physically. And so what's happening is he's jumping off this
4337600	4342400	cliff, but he's chosen to short cliff because he doesn't really want to die. But he thinks this
4342400	4347440	quantum suicide thing is a great thing because he's falling into this mental illness. But, um,
4347440	4352000	it's an interesting process, but, um, yeah, very disturbed. But basically he jumps, neither of them
4352000	4357840	die. He pulls her down. She's got a knife. She's so pissed. She kills him. I'm sorry. I'm laughing,
4357840	4365920	but it's like, okay. Uh, she's in prison. She got life in prison. Yeah. That's just self-defense.
4365920	4371760	Well, she, well, she didn't, there's more to the story. I mean, she, she, she slit his throat.
4371760	4376480	Like, yeah, so long story short, they go, they go off the cliff. Um, he has pulled her off the
4376480	4380960	cliff by grabbing her hand and kill anyone who they have the knife. We assumed the knife was to
4380960	4386560	finish the job on either one of them. If they lived, he got up first, he helped her to her feet,
4386560	4390960	according to her. And they walked about a mile and a half from the forest. Now they're completely
4390960	4395120	nude. It's the middle of the winter is raining. It's freezing cold and temperatures right about
4395120	4400560	freezing. And, um, they basically get about a mile and a half and they get to a Creek and they're
4400560	4407120	about to cross this Creek. And then suddenly her story gets a little fuzzy and he ends up face down
4407120	4411600	in the Creek with his throat cut. And it's not just cut. I mean, he's almost decapitated. So,
4412400	4417600	it looks like he was cut between three to seven times. And she suggested that he was the one who
4417600	4424240	cut his own throat. Right. It's kind of, yeah, it almost, well, I guess that she would probably
4424240	4431040	only serve a couple of years. If in fact it was just bottom of the cliff, she stabbed him to death,
4431040	4437040	like, because then she could tell all of the truth and be like, this Dick. And every time the judge
4437040	4441040	would be like, yeah, or the jury would go like, okay, I mean, you know, one's in their right mind
4441040	4447040	when someone who they think they're just helping commit suicide grabs their hand, pulls them down.
4447040	4453200	And you had a knife and he sounds like a real jerk. He left his pets in a fucking box up there.
4453200	4457840	And when he pulled you down with him, that meant he was fine with the cat, his fucking animals
4457840	4462560	freezing to death. Yeah. Um, anyways, but, but, but the, but the weird thing is she's a life in
4462560	4469120	prison because of the, just because it took her a while and, and also her insistence that it was
4469120	4476320	his, that he, that not only that he demanded that she kill him, but that he physically told
4476320	4481920	her to put, to stand behind him and put the knife up to his throat. And in her version of the story,
4481920	4487360	she's like, and I didn't, I wasn't sure what he was up to at that point. And then he took my hand
4487360	4493760	and started sawing. And it's like, like, geez, I mean, well, you're asking us to believe like,
4493840	4499280	it would be easier to believe you were mad at, at a Dick. Exactly. Well, I think that the toughest
4499280	4504960	part of it for the, you know, for the jury and for the police as well, um, is that when they found
4504960	4510720	her, she started telling one story and as they moved through the paramedics to the police, to
4510720	4517360	multiple interviews with detectives, she told a different story about his death each time. And so
4517360	4522560	it just kept evolving to a point where she had more and more involvement. And so once she told
4522560	4527360	the story about five times, her hand was on the knife with his. And so at that point,
4527360	4531760	she can't go any farther and concede anything more. But we know that there is more that she
4531760	4536080	actually killed him because her story has not. Okay. So she started with the simplest thing,
4536080	4538800	which is like, she walked for a while and he slid his own throat. And they're like,
4539600	4545680	she first says that he died from injuries when he fell off the cliff. No, obviously. Okay. Yeah.
4545680	4550320	That's what she told the paramedics and they testified to that. And so she, she, that's what
4550320	4555280	she first said. And obviously that's not true. And then she said that he fell on a knife in the
4555280	4561520	woods and obviously that's not going over too well. So from there, it became that she was actually
4562960	4567920	at the Creek and he killed himself. But then due to the number of slices across the throat,
4567920	4572560	they assumed that he wouldn't be able to do that. And she started to concede a little more with each
4572560	4577760	detective interview. And finally, once they had her hand on the knife, then they didn't bother to
4577760	4585440	go any farther. They felt like they had enough. Yeah. So did he believe in multiple universes or
4585440	4590800	realities or whatever? Yeah. I mean, that, that was the, uh, it was basically quantum mysticism.
4590800	4595280	And so he was thinking that there was another version of him somewhere else and in parallel
4595280	4601760	universe or alternate reality where he was going to die from this quantum suicide and then assume
4601760	4607280	that other life where he made different decisions and he was going to be happier. And obviously
4607280	4610560	that ends him. Do you think he thought she was going to die or do you think she like,
4610560	4614960	he thought like, Oh, she'll be like Christopher the mill. Like, yeah, I think he fully intended
4614960	4619120	for her to die and to transcend this world with him. I think he wanted to take someone with him.
4619120	4623200	Right. There you go. Okay. And then she was not aware of that. He was manipulating her
4623200	4627280	by promising her that money to get her up on the cliff. And then, and then they're like
4627280	4632000	wandering around the metaphysical realm together or in some world that's made of pizza. And she's
4632000	4636480	like, why am I here? And he's like, I pulled you down. And she's like, you son of a bitch,
4636480	4642880	I'll take pepperoni. Tell me about your day. It's like, it's the Chris Pratt passengers movie,
4643760	4649440	relationship. Well, you did what? You life ruined her. Give me that dick.
4652160	4659440	I can't stay mad at you. I haven't seen that movie is hysterical. I've told you, I've said this
4659440	4662480	before. I know nobody laughed when I said this, but I'm telling you, you got to watch the movie.
4662480	4667120	And I, you gotta, you gotta give me some fucking credit. Cause it was so like, and I'm sorry that
4667120	4672320	it's, it's a, it's a crass area, but obviously like what he's doing is, is essentially like,
4672320	4681200	like, it's like a, a, a, a, it's a, it's a, it's a non-consensual, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
4681200	4687280	what the abduction, uh, uh, he, he, he, he's, he's, he's, yeah, he's assaulting her life.
4688160	4690640	Right. He kind of in a way sentences her to death.
4690640	4695280	And then I made the joke and it, you know, we kept using the R word. I'm going to use the R word
4695280	4701280	as infrequently as possible in my hilarious, like appraisal of the movie. But, but, but, but like
4701280	4706320	Cody and I are using, it's like, it's like, this is, it's like, Jesus, like, okay. And then I made
4706320	4712240	the joke. It was like, well, there's only one way out of this feature film story. Like third,
4712240	4719520	bottom of the second act, the spaceship's gonna need to be raped and he'll somehow do it. It's
4719520	4725920	absolutely what happened. There's a hole on the ship that he had to go into that didn't want you
4725920	4731520	in it. Then it's all explained. Like there's a hole and he has to like go in it, force his way
4731520	4736640	up it. And it's just totally like the ship won't want you in that hole and it'll try to blast you
4736640	4743120	out. But if you can just stay in there and stay alive long enough to pull this lever, you'll save
4743120	4747840	everybody. And, and that's the act that he does. Of course, when you come back from that, she's like,
4747840	4753120	you know, it all comes out in the wash. Like, you know, because the man at you for doing the first
4753120	4758480	thing, but then you, then you, then you, you have saved the ship and then they plant a tree and
4759280	4766320	grow old together. Nobody's laughing again. I sometimes it's just a, I mean, I just like,
4766320	4772400	I, I just like to watch a movie and you're like, I, I, to make that joke of them to have the joke
4772400	4776160	that you made that you did not expect. Well, this is like fucking actually what they wrote.
4777600	4782560	It's fantastic. It'd be like if you were watching Monster House and I was like,
4782560	4786960	well, there's only one way out of this. Probably find out the house is like a sad fat person and,
4788560	4792960	they just, just have tea and tell the story with the whole house is waiting across the street.
4795520	4796020	Yeah.
4796020	4804740	Making of a murderer. Did you watch that documentary?
4804740	4805700	I have. Yeah.
4805700	4808340	Yeah. What do you think? Do you hate it?
4809460	4814260	I'm not big on, I mean, I love documentaries for the purpose of entertainment, but as far as
4814260	4818740	investigating a crime, they're definitely not the best thing to look at. I mean, just for the fact
4818740	4824100	that it's edited and it's, you know, it's a created narrative, whether it's, you know, entirely true
4824100	4827540	or not. Yeah. It's generally edited in a way that makes it the most entertaining.
4827540	4833060	But if you studied that case, what do you think? Do you have, I definitely think he's guilty.
4833060	4835460	You definitely think he's absolutely. What about the kid?
4836740	4842900	Um, I believe he was involved, but I don't know to what extent. Yeah. I mean, there, I mean,
4842900	4850260	that, yeah, that aspect of is the biggest bummer. Yeah. Because obviously he was mistreated very
4850260	4855460	badly. And so we don't really get a good sense of the truth. Right. Right. So why do you think
4855460	4859460	that he did it? What was it? Because I mean, I watched it and I went, Oh, this poor guy.
4860340	4864420	It's consistent with his character. And he also on the day that it happened, I mean,
4864420	4871700	he actually set her up to come there under false pretenses and he had already harassed her. And so
4871700	4876180	that was, that's really the next step. I mean, if you look at people who commit murders in that way,
4876180	4878580	they generally start with things like that. And it escalates.
4878580	4884180	Yeah. So that lie in particular, we don't have to, I mean, that's the, the, the idea that you have
4884180	4890900	the, that that's the prop, like the police want to do their job really well. They want to save
4890900	4895940	the world from evil people and they like, they can't stand the idea of somebody getting away
4895940	4899700	with it or they're, they become certain somebody did something. And then maybe sometimes they'll
4899700	4904660	put their thumbs on some scales or they'll like overlook some clerical Miranda business or
4904660	4908980	something. And, or they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll be like, well, maybe we can get this
4908980	4914180	confession or, you know, through this means of that because they've got their eyes on the final
4914180	4921860	prize. And it's exactly that mentality that we have to abandon when we watch these like serial
4922580	4928020	kind of things. Cause it's like people go, Oh, I, I'm going to debunk serial. Cause I think
4928020	4936580	Adnan did it, but it's like, well, that's not really the point is rule of law. The point is the
4936580	4943380	terrible investigating, terrible law enforcement, terrible trials done terribly where whether the
4943380	4950100	person did it or not, they shouldn't be in prison by any of our definition, our standards of
4950100	4956020	jurisprudence, whatever that word means. Like, like you, you, you, you agree. I assume like,
4956020	4960260	it's like, like you can still enjoy these documentaries without having, you know,
4960260	4963860	I think people think they're ruining it and they go, you know, that guy's a bag of dicks. He did it.
4963860	4969460	I'm like, well, still they shafted them. I think guilt and police misconduct are not mutually
4969460	4974900	exclusive. I think most of the most of the really interesting cases involve not only somebody who's
4974900	4980980	guilty and pretending to be innocent, but also a case where that person is making strides in that
4980980	4985780	sense, because there's a lot of police misconduct. We do see a lot of cases like that. And they're
4985780	4991540	very interesting. It's unfortunate that it takes place, but yeah, that's why I, my mind is blown
4991540	4998260	by like good, good, by the book homicide detectives, like the guys that Yardley's always having as
4998260	5003060	guests, like just like, geez, how can you suspend that dramatic part of your brain? That's like,
5004420	5009620	you'd, you'd, you'd, you'd do it. You're an Asperger detective. You'd be like,
5009620	5014660	let me look around this scene. You guys see Caddyshack? Caddyshack? What are you talking about?
5015300	5023060	It's a movie about resources and redirection of light. Oh, what? We got a fucking psycho on our
5023060	5028420	hands. Hey, he's a psycho that gets results. The captain said, this guy came from Paris. He's
5028420	5037060	Interpol. Watch him. And then you just like follow like this. You're like, you're like laying down
5037060	5042420	sunflower seeds and follow the trail of them to a cellar door and a body falls out.
5044660	5056420	Holy shit, this guy's got serious Asperger's. And the, and the chief's,
5056420	5061860	chief's like, yeah, he's got them all the way to the bank. I've never clued so many cases in my life.
5062820	5070740	Say hello to your new partner, uh, Rhea Pearlman. Yeah, I don't know.
5070740	5077300	It seems that'd be good casting. Yeah, I, I, you and Rhea Pearlman.
5079300	5085060	Let's just say my iCloud as my ex-wife called it, probably because I had dinner with, uh, a DeVito.
5086820	5090580	I was thinking about Rhea Pearlman somewhere in the back of my head for casting. I don't know.
5091620	5098420	Which DeVito? There were several DeVitos at the dinner, dick. There's a lot of DeVitos.
5098420	5107380	So fuck you. Shit. So which DeVito?
5110020	5118100	Two, two of them, including the big one. Frank DeVito. No, baby. Double D.
5120260	5126340	Double D. Yeah. And you know, fucking Batman walked in. Yeah, I know. You listen to the show.
5126340	5132180	You like it. Fucking Michael Keaton came in. Remember when we met Michael Keaton like 20 years ago?
5132180	5139380	Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was like the first famous person we ever like saw. After Stiller. Yeah.
5142580	5146020	Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause we made Heat Fusion a jacket. That's why Michael Keaton
5146020	5152420	wanted to meet us. Yeah. And it was just like, we're like standing, standing outside his Santa Monica
5152420	5159300	office. Like, and I just, I thought I was going to pass out. I was that nervous. Cause it was like,
5159300	5163860	what are we doing? Why are we meeting Michael Keaton? What does he want? It's like a Saturday.
5163860	5169620	Yeah. And then we saw a car drive by him. We're like, do we think that was Michael Keaton's car?
5169620	5174900	Like, what does he, does he, does he come up on a scooter or like on that ocean drive or whatever,
5174900	5178180	where it's just like, there's people are just rollerblading. Like there's no way to,
5178180	5181540	it's almost like a dream. I can't, I don't, I can't believe that happened to him. Was he going to
5181540	5188100	paraglide in? Was Michael Keaton already in there and he's just hiding? But I think he, I think he
5188100	5193140	drove in and like parked. That's how fucking good that script was. Yeah. Batman said, hey,
5193140	5197620	come over to my house on a Sunday. Let me meet with these guys. I want to meet with these guys.
5200340	5203140	You know, I read, I read the script. I want these guys to come in and let me,
5203140	5207300	let me talk to them. Let me pick their brain. I think that's a pretty good Michael Keaton.
5207300	5213460	Norm Macdonald does a pretty good Michael Keaton. Better than that. Who are you doing?
5213460	5220100	Let me meet these guys. Let me meet these guys. Now I lost it. I always do. I do great first
5220100	5230420	impressions. Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton. Anyways, wait, wait, wait. Remember, remember
5230420	5236820	how he opened the door? He was just like, he opened it so fast. You remember, right? You remember the
5236820	5241780	moment of meeting Michael Keaton. I thought that you and I shared, it was like, that's implanted
5241780	5248340	in our memory. It isn't. It isn't. I mean, I was like, how is Michael Keaton going to arrive?
5248340	5253220	I was freaking out. And then he just, like the door just flew open, just flew open. And he had
5253220	5260740	just had this, like, hey. Yeah. Like he was, like he had been in there and he was worried he was
5260740	5264820	late and it was just like, like, like the door couldn't open fast enough. And it was just like,
5266820	5272580	and then we just, you think we blew that meeting? Well, if the goal was to develop with Michael
5272580	5277140	Keaton, we blew it. We blew it. Yeah. Yeah. We walked out without. I think, I think, you know,
5277140	5282980	I mean, I was like, yeah, meeting Michael Keaton. I mean, like I was, you'd probably did all the
5282980	5291300	talking and I just sat there going, but yeah, I hardly remember any of it because I'm, I'm just.
5291300	5295700	Well, the conclusion of it was. Yeah. That we were, we were both kind of like,
5296420	5300100	because he was basically saying to us, I mean, he said a lot about a lot of stuff,
5300100	5303940	like the kinds of characters he likes to play. I mean, it's like, like I look back and I go like,
5303940	5308020	geez, should be so lucky. And it's not that we thought we weren't. It's not like we were looking
5308020	5314500	down at it, but we just, I mean, it was like, it's like, like he was basically like kind of saying,
5314500	5321780	write something for me. Uh, and I'll, I'll, I'll use my like name and thing, you know,
5321780	5325220	and like, like I'll, I'll, or, or he wasn't actually saying, write something for me.
5325220	5329220	That's the thing. He was, he was one of those things was like, cause he was a movie star. He's
5329220	5335860	like, Oh, you know, I'll, I'll EP it and like, I'll do a part in it. Yeah. He wanted to do what
5335860	5340340	Stiller was doing with heat vision and Jack. Sure. So then, so then, but then we were kind of just
5340340	5345220	like, well, if you have any ideas, let us know. That was like, uh, cause we were like from
5345220	5350260	Wisconsin, we're kind of like, well, we don't just tell Michael Keaton what to say he created.
5350900	5357140	Like that's doesn't make any sense. We're like, well, fucking think about something and call us.
5357140	5362900	Jesus Christ. Let's get out of here. Fucking Batman. Call us down here. I think we were,
5362900	5368580	I think we were like, we did act a little like, boy, what's up with him? He's kind of weird,
5368580	5373060	but I think that was all about just being insecure. I mean, from my point of view,
5373060	5378340	it was being insecure, like going, Oh geez. Well, we were insecure. Yeah. Uh, wait, wait,
5378340	5383780	me more than you. I was like, yeah, we were like, how do you do a Michael Keaton meeting? Right. And
5383780	5389140	then, and then it was the easier path was to go like, well, he did it wrong. Let's get out of here.
5389140	5396340	Hey, you in the mood for pretzels buddy, get out of my brain. Best friends. Yeah. Um, I think I
5396420	5406260	was driving. Yeah, probably. Well, you don't know which guy was you in that exchange,
5408100	5416980	but, but, but he, he was being very vulnerable, communicative, like, like loquacious. He was like
5416980	5421700	enthusiastic. We could have done that meeting better. I wish we could have easily turned it
5421700	5429060	into a job. Yeah. We, we, we fucked up. We fucked. There's a quantum world out there where we,
5429060	5434260	we fucking went from stiller to Keaton. It was quantum suicide. Yeah. Well, well, well, no,
5434260	5439540	that's the gateway is quantum suicide. I'm talking, we gotta get there. Shrob, would you accompany me
5441060	5447940	for how much to Griffith park? There's a certain wall. Would you go in the bushes with me
5448900	5451700	in Griffith park and have
5454420	5464420	a, what, what? This is your thing. Yeah, I don't know. All right. Uh, wow. Okay. Well,
5465220	5470260	I hear that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought they would. It would,
5470260	5476820	I don't think there's another Godzilla movie now. No. Oh, yeah. I don't know what the difference
5476900	5481060	between jokes. It was like three weeks ago or something like that. All I, all I heard from
5481060	5486660	is like, well, that Godzilla movie didn't do as well as they thought it was. Have you seen
5486660	5492340	the new Godzilla movie? Didn't even know it existed. Okay. And you're a detective.
5495700	5503620	The creature is 700 feet tall. You haven't found him. What was he hiding in Madison Square Garden?
5503620	5511220	Yeah. Come on. Come on. Have they ever made a good one? Shit. Yeah. Shit. Fuck. Yeah, man. Yeah.
5511220	5517940	Which one? Yeah. The first one is awesome. The first one's great. And Godzilla versus
5517940	5523860	biolanta is great. It's from the nineties. That one's fucking good. You know what else is good?
5524660	5534740	Blade. Blade's a fucking good movie, man. Fucking Wesley Snipes. Yep. Fucking Blade. Yep. Is great.
5534740	5543140	Yep. Prove me wrong. Can't. Won't. You can't. Won't. Can't. Can't. Hey, can we do it? Can I be
5543140	5548500	Blade and you be a whistler? Sure. Can I, and I want to come home from a rave where I killed
5548500	5554900	all the vampires. I'm just going to check in with you. Riding my Blade car into the warehouse.
5562420	5563940	Those nunchucks you gave me.
5567860	5568660	Out of garlic.
5571780	5574820	I'm just mixing up some more garlic for you right now.
5574820	5581540	It's more blood suckers out there than ever before.
5582580	5587780	Better be open season on suck heads because we're in the suck head killing business.
5590980	5601300	I'm thinking of getting out. This shit's too deep. Blade, you can't get out. You're, you can't.
5601700	5609700	How's that cure coming? I'm working on it. You know what? I'm working on it. What are you?
5609700	5614020	Wait, I don't want to cure. Do I? Because I have all of their strengths and none of their weaknesses.
5614580	5620660	That's what I keep telling you. Yeah. I don't want to cure. Do I like, do I like what I do?
5623220	5628740	I hope. Are we both on the same page? I hope so. Okay. That's refreshing because of you. You know
5628740	5633780	how Alfred's always fucking bitching at Batman. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. Go to a couple's
5633780	5638820	therapists like, okay, same page club. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, let's see what you got.
5638820	5642900	All right. You ready? Sorry about my comment about it. Okay. I thought I was saying what you
5642900	5648660	wanted to hear. All right. Okay. So check this out. Sit down at the dinner table. Okay. Okay.
5648660	5656740	I think you're going to like this. It's a new recipe and I know it's not as spicy
5657380	5664340	because you don't like it when it's spicy. No, no, sir. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. I thought maybe
5664340	5669220	weapons. Yeah. Take it. Take it. Okay. Take a taste of that. See what you think. You like that?
5669220	5678900	That aftertaste. Oh, God damn. Cilantro. Shit. Yeah. God damn. Yeah. Yeah. The shit you get up to.
5678900	5687540	Yeah. Make Jackrabbit slap the bear, man. So colloquial. Yeah. Hey, remember when you found me?
5689380	5693540	Yeah. You were just a little blade.
5696980	5701460	Who came up with blade? Was that you or me? I don't remember. Cara, you told me
5702820	5707460	everything needs a name. That's how you put it. Yeah. That's how you refer to things.
5709860	5713540	By their name. I didn't exactly get a lot of schooling.
5715140	5721460	I relied on you for not only education, but also just a basic framework of thought.
5723060	5730340	Like literally nobody told me how to speak or read or learn. Nope. You always told me
5730900	5737860	everything needs a name. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's very true. I taught you well then because name
5737860	5746420	one thing that doesn't have one. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't name a single
5746420	5752580	thing without one. And that's the first lesson. That's why we named your blade. All right. All
5752580	5756980	right. Listen to me talking. All right. Instead of eating this soup. Here, try some of this bread
5756980	5766660	I made. It's full of wheat germ. God damn. I'm too good for you. I'm afraid to agree. I wake up one
5766660	5772020	day, see an open window with a curtain blowing in the breeze and a little tear come down my
5772020	5778420	cheek. Yeah. Yeah. Why, why, why are you crying? Why would you cry? Don't make me say it out loud.
5779060	5781860	Well, the window, there's a drape on it. You can close it.
5783780	5789460	Are you crying because it's cold and there's no window? Because did the window break in the
5789460	5795860	scenario? Did you break a window? Are you sad because you broke a window or because the drapes
5795940	5803620	are open? What's good? Whoa. Okay. Give me that. Give me that. What? Give me that. Taking my soup.
5804260	5811860	Why are you crying? What? Take my soup. Explain yourself. This is a deflection.
5812900	5816820	You know what I mean. No, I don't. I'm afraid you'll leave me because I love you.
5816820	5824020	Look at me like that. You pulled it out of me like a fang.
5826420	5834980	I was happy to leave it edgy and muscular. Platonic. No homo is the hip hop community says.
5835940	5841620	I don't approve of it. Find that problematic. You want to see the new Trident? Yes.
5842340	5847860	Look at that. This Trident has four dents.
5852580	5853540	There's a hidden one.
5857700	5859380	It's a quadrant. Quadrant.
5861860	5864340	Now press the other button.
5867780	5868820	You can brush your teeth.
5871620	5880900	You taught me how to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Once a month, you get a new battery.
5881700	5886900	It doesn't seem to be vibrating very hard. I thought that a vibrating toothbrush,
5886900	5891940	I thought the whole point was for it to vibrate so hard, it shakes all the dirt off your teeth.
5892500	5898020	Well, your teeth are so clean, it doesn't need to shake that hard. How come it vibrates for
5898020	5902980	two minutes and then stops and then starts again? You're supposed to do the other side.
5902980	5906340	Oh, it's like a reminder. Wow. What a product.
5908740	5911220	Here, why don't you put this lotion on my feet?
5915380	5918820	Well, if you had just give me a Trident, I wouldn't be doing this.
5918820	5919620	Yeah.
5922740	5926100	Gotta make the fart noise. You know what that sounds like.
5928980	5933460	Okay, put those gross ass fucking gremlins up here. Come on, you old man.
5933460	5934260	Okay.
5934260	5938260	Look like goddamn Billy Bob from Showbiz Pizza, fucking bare feet.
5939700	5942900	Still so ticklish. Ashy ass feet.
5944180	5944980	Look like a goddamn.
5944980	5947700	Well, they wouldn't be so ashy if you would put more cream on it.
5947860	5948820	Put some more cream on it.
5948820	5950020	What do you think I'm trying to do, you old man?
5950020	5951060	Put some more cream on it.
5951060	5952180	Goddamn it, I love you.
5952180	5953300	Stop tickling so much.
5953300	5957060	You're not trying to tickle you. I'm trying to hydrate your goddamn ashy ass,
5957060	5960820	dry ass wooden stumps you call feet. You old poop.
5969940	5970900	You want to watch it again?
5971700	5972740	Watch? Yes.
5974740	5976020	I'll get the DVD player.
5976020	5976660	Okay, great.
5977860	5979700	I'm going to walk across the linoleum.
5983060	5984660	What? Oh, no.
5986820	5987460	Whistler.
5993140	5995220	Whistler. Hold on.
5995860	5996420	What happened?
5998420	6002020	My feet are so hydrated, I slipped on a load of linoleum.
6002020	6004260	Goddamn it. Why are we even walking over here?
6005060	6006260	Give me the med kit.
6006260	6006660	Yeah.
6006660	6007060	Shit.
6007140	6008500	There's one in the trident.
6008500	6009380	I'll fly there.
6013380	6014100	Did some flips.
6016260	6019060	Where are the band-aids in the stem?
6019060	6021780	Yeah, you unscrew it and then you put the band-aids on.
6022660	6023460	Oh, shit.
6023460	6024020	Shit everywhere.
6024020	6025540	Oh, shit. I'm going.
6025540	6026740	I'm going, Blade.
6026740	6027060	What?
6027060	6027860	I'm going.
6027860	6029380	No, this ain't how you go.
6029380	6030180	I'm going.
6030180	6032020	No, I can't do this without you.
6032020	6034500	No, I'm slipping down the hallway because of the thing.
6034500	6035380	Oh.
6035380	6035860	Help me.
6036500	6037540	I'm going.
6037540	6038260	I'm going.
6038980	6039620	Oh, shit.
6039620	6040100	What?
6040100	6041300	Help me.
6041300	6041780	Shit.
6041780	6042820	Help me.
6042820	6043780	There's nothing I can do.
6045380	6046020	It's gone.
6047860	6048820	That's how I lost him.
6051620	6053380	Anyways, that's how I lost him.
6055860	6059060	That's very, very interesting, Mr. Blade.
6060580	6065060	And you're saying, I don't even have to fight vampires.
6065140	6066180	Only if you want to.
6067300	6068660	Just feels wrong not to.
6069220	6070180	I killed my mom.
6071140	6071940	Was it?
6071940	6076180	I mean, if fighting vampires makes you feel good,
6076180	6077940	then that's what you should do.
6077940	6082020	As long as you're not hurting any non-vampire people.
6084100	6084820	It's hard.
6086980	6088020	I'm a daywalker.
6089700	6091940	I can be out during the day, but they can't.
6091940	6096180	So if I sleep during the day like they do,
6096820	6098900	I'm just voluntarily being like one of them.
6099620	6103620	But if I sleep at night, that's when they do their thing.
6104820	6107780	It's like burning the candle at both ends.
6108900	6109380	Yeah.
6109380	6110820	I skate and uphill.
6110820	6111220	Yep.
6111220	6112100	That's our time.
6114500	6114900	All right.
6115860	6117300	Do you want to give me a check?
6119300	6120340	You use Venmo?
6122580	6123380	Yeah, we can do that.
6123380	6124420	We can do that.
6124420	6125220	I don't know how.
6127540	6129460	Whistler used to do everything.
6130500	6136180	Now I'll just walk around and increasingly dilapidated Kevlar vests.
6137780	6139780	Little plastic buckles on them.
6139780	6141220	Half of them don't work anymore.
6142580	6143860	Got one katana.
6146340	6149620	Half a greasy ass fucking biker bottle full of
6149620	6152900	the active ingredient of garlic.
6154260	6155700	Can't even remember the names.
6156900	6158180	Got a UV light.
6159060	6160180	Doesn't even look cool.
6161060	6163700	Only thing you can do with it is melt fat vampires.
6165300	6166260	They in a basement.
6166980	6168020	It's not what I want to do.
6168900	6170020	I want to kick a bitch.
6174100	6175540	I've wasted enough of your time.
6176260	6179060	Uh, I'll try to get you the money in some way.
6179940	6181860	Can I keep sleeping in your basement?
6181860	6184180	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6184180	6185140	Here's the stairs.
6185700	6186180	Thank you.
6186180	6187620	Here they are right here.
6190660	6193620	I try not to disturb you with the rest of your patience.
6198500	6203220	Well, I've been waiting, waiting for so long.
6206500	6208180	While thinking nothing.
6209380	6210660	DVD player.
6210660	6212260	Nothing could go wrong.
6213700	6214900	But now I know.
6215780	6216740	SpaghettiOs.
6219140	6221940	She has a built-in ability.
6224660	6228980	Cylinder of fucking gross ass old SpaghettiOs plopping on a plate.
6230100	6231300	Dirty microwave.
6231300	6233780	To take everything she sees.
6233940	6234900	Beep beep.
6234900	6235700	It's goddamn it.
6235700	6236900	What power ten?
6236900	6238500	What the fuck does that even mean?
6239780	6243460	And now I see I'm falling, falling for her.
6243460	6246660	She seems to have an invisible touch.
6248420	6252340	He reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart.
6256020	6256580	Go away.
6258020	6258500	All right.
6264260	6264740	Beep.
6264740	6265220	Go.
6266740	6268260	God fucking damn it.
6268260	6268980	What the fuck?
6268980	6270660	Shitty spaghetti.
6274100	6275780	Fucking hot.
6276740	6277380	Damn.
6280100	6284740	Why I tell the only person that knocks on my door to go away?
6286740	6288340	Could have been anybody.
6288340	6291380	It's not like the problem I have is,
6292100	6293540	it's not like the problem I have is,
6295700	6296340	who is it?
6297620	6299460	Did I get you at a bad time?
6301860	6302340	Can't be.
6305460	6309220	If you're a mimic, one of seven classes of vampire,
6309220	6312260	you should know I got a gun on the other side of this door
6312260	6315860	that'll send you a blood sucking ass all over the wallpaper.
6318260	6319860	Just open the door blade.
6321620	6322420	Grrr.
6324980	6328100	She seems to have an invisible touch.
6332100	6335700	She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart.
6340900	6342260	Do you still have the trident?
6342260	6343300	Oh shit, yeah.
6344100	6344900	Oh fuck.
6345860	6346660	God damn it.
6347540	6348820	There's a fourth trident?
6348820	6349860	Oh shit, one of them.
6350740	6352180	One of them's rubbing my teeth.
6354020	6355860	I think I dropped my phone earlier.
6355860	6356740	Oh shit.
6357460	6357940	Find it.
6364100	6364900	This is a good movie.
6364900	6367300	See, you know, it is a great, great movie.
6372500	6375460	All right, well, is there anything to plug?
6375460	6376740	Watch, go to the...
6379860	6383780	That's some lazy improv.
6384500	6386660	That is some lazy as improv.
6390660	6391860	Oh my God.
6392660	6398420	If I could beam that to us when we were like 20, 24.
6398420	6400660	And just go, stop working so hard.
6400660	6402820	You guys are just sitting.
6402820	6404580	You're not even standing up and running.
6404580	6408100	And you're still talking about the movie we just saw last week?
6410660	6413780	Like, isn't there like hologram television,
6413780	6417540	like about like teenagers doing weird drugs on HBO?
6417540	6420180	Like, have you guys even watched Atlanta yet?
6422580	6424420	No, just rewatch and blade.
6426100	6427460	It's that good.
6427460	6429540	In fact, nothing gets better.
6429540	6430580	It's a great movie.
6430580	6431940	You know who's in that movie?
6431940	6433220	Wesley Snipes.
6433220	6433940	You know who else?
6435460	6436260	Donal Loeg.
6437140	6443540	Who would go on, who would build on that role to play me?
6444980	6445780	Oh, shit.
6445780	6446900	Yeah, that's right.
6449780	6451620	All right, well, you know, I was like...
6452340	6456980	Anyway, Ryan's one of those guys that makes his own app for his podcast.
6458820	6460020	What is it, in the app store?
6460980	6462740	Yeah, the iOS version is in the app store.
6462740	6464740	And that's where the shit really goes ham.
6464740	6465460	Is that a good thing?
6466580	6467060	Go ham.
6467940	6468820	Morty.
6470500	6471860	Is it good to go ham, Morty?
6473220	6477220	Because, I mean, you're, you know, behind the paywall,
6477220	6478580	that's where the magic happens.
6479460	6480980	You do spoken word shit.
6480980	6483140	You're just fucking like, you're crazy.
6483140	6484340	Oh, yeah, definitely crazy.
6485300	6486020	It's great.
6486020	6486820	It's fantastic.
6487380	6489300	I don't want to embarrass Spencer, but he really...
6492020	6494580	You got a lot out of listening to Ryan's podcast.
6494580	6497220	I got a lot out of listening to Ryan's podcast.
6497220	6499140	Why would you be embarrassed about that?
6502260	6503060	Well, I'll tell you why.
6503060	6507380	Nobody wants to be referred to in the third person emotionally.
6507380	6507860	I do.
6508740	6509780	I watched that happen a lot.
6509780	6512180	We took the kids to Disneyland, and I was like,
6512180	6513860	I know what's going on here.
6513860	6515700	Like, yeah, she wanted to meet Minnie Mouse,
6515700	6517140	but, you know, she's overwhelmed.
6517140	6519700	It's like, she didn't know Minnie Mouse was a giant fucking thing.
6519700	6523140	And then it's like the adults having conversations about like,
6523140	6524820	I thought you liked Thunder Mountain.
6524820	6525860	I thought you wanted this.
6525860	6528020	And it's kind of like, you're overwhelmed and you might be like,
6528020	6530020	stop talking about what I think and like.
6530020	6531700	I need to fucking chill.
6531700	6535220	My little tiny fucking four horsepower brain is like,
6535220	6540740	like just fucking flooded by this corporate goddamn heroin trip.
6541300	6543620	Like, I got a fucking freak out.
6543620	6545060	There were two...
6545060	6549060	There were like three Yetis on that first roller coaster ride.
6549060	6550820	What's the one that's bobsled themed?
6551780	6554100	Uh, there's two little runnings.
6554100	6561140	And, uh, five year old Ryland was in the front car.
6561780	6563700	That was his first roller coaster ever.
6564260	6566980	And I was like in the car behind him and I kept yelling.
6566980	6569140	I was like, what are you doing?
6569140	6570740	Because he was in the front car.
6570740	6571860	I was like, wait, no.
6572740	6573300	Did he think he was...
6573300	6574260	Run away.
6574260	6575380	Do you think he was staring?
6575940	6577940	Well, I was acting like I thought he was staring.
6578500	6579620	But he's five.
6579620	6582420	He might have been like, fuck, he thinks I'm staring.
6582420	6582900	I'm sorry.
6582900	6584580	I was like, this isn't even bobsledding.
6585300	6586980	Do you even know what you're doing?
6586980	6587780	Did you ever...
6587780	6589300	Did you go on Splash Mountain?
6591060	6591300	No.
6591940	6593380	Do you know Splash Mountain?
6593380	6594340	Yeah, I've gone on it.
6594340	6595860	Do you know why it's called Splash Mountain?
6597700	6598900	Because a lady died on it?
6600100	6600340	No.
6602340	6608020	It used to be a, um, song of the south inspired ride.
6608980	6612580	And then somebody went, oh my god, we can't do that anymore.
6612580	6613140	Yeah.
6613140	6616740	And then Splash, Daryl Hannah, Tom Hanks Splash.
6616740	6617780	Shut up.
6617780	6619140	They called it Splash Mountain.
6619140	6619700	Shut up.
6619700	6621940	So if you go to Splash Mountain, I think there's like,
6621940	6624340	they just play song of the south music.
6624340	6627460	No, there's the bears in there and there's rabbits in the brine.
6627460	6630260	And it's Splash, but they call it Splash Mountain.
6630260	6631140	Because of...
6631140	6631860	Look it up.
6631860	6632660	Why?
6632660	6633860	Recent mountain?
6633860	6635060	Look it up.
6635060	6636100	Look it up.
6636100	6637300	What was it called before?
6637300	6638900	You should know what it's called if the story is true.
6638900	6641620	No, I don't because it's called Splash Mountain.
6641620	6645300	It was called Uncle Tom's fucking, like, tea cup.
6645300	6646580	It was called something else.
6647220	6649940	The point of my story is that it's called Splash Mountain.
6649940	6652180	Then why isn't there a mermaid anywhere in there?
6652180	6653700	You've got bad information.
6653700	6654820	It's not true.
6654820	6656260	Okay, well, all right.
6656260	6657460	It's called Zippity River Run.
6657460	6658180	Ooh.
6658180	6658580	It's called what?
6658580	6659540	Zippity River Run.
6660100	6661140	Zippity River Run.
6661140	6661380	Right.
6661380	6662740	That sounds authentic.
6662740	6663380	Right, okay.
6663380	6664980	And now it's called Splash Mountain.
6664980	6666500	Now it's called Splash Mountain.
6666500	6666980	Okay.
6666980	6668500	But really, is it...
6668500	6670020	Do you know this or are you Googling it?
6670020	6671860	Do you know if it was named after the...
6671860	6674020	If the splash connection is true?
6674020	6675380	Right.
6675380	6675700	Okay.
6676500	6680020	I recognize the sound of Disney experts.
6680020	6680420	You don't...
6680420	6681860	And you do not want to fuck with them.
6681860	6682420	So, okay.
6683460	6684100	I retreat.
6684900	6685380	All right.
6685380	6686100	Fascinating.
6686100	6687860	Just say you're right.
6687860	6691300	You're welcome for making it possible for you to be right about something.
6696500	6702660	Check out cold case murder mysteries.
6703700	6704100	Oh, shit.
6704100	6704740	We forgot.
6704740	6706260	Ryan Reynolds was our guest tonight.
6706260	6707380	Should we bring him out or should we...
6707380	6708340	I guess it's like two hours.
6708340	6708980	Yeah.
6708980	6709220	Okay.
6709220	6709540	All right.
6709540	6710820	Well, sorry, guys.
6710820	6712740	We usually have a guest and sometimes I forget about them.
6712740	6713860	We did this time.
6713860	6714580	Well, we'll go...
6715540	6717140	Ryan Reynolds.
6717140	6718500	Deadpool 4 somewhere else.
6719860	6721140	He's the Merc with a Mouth.
6721940	6724500	The Merc with a Mouth.
6724500	6727460	Dan likes them because they both break the fourth wall.
6727460	6728180	Yeah.
6728180	6729380	Who else does?
6731220	6731700	I do.
6732660	6733300	You just did.
6734340	6735460	By saying that.
6735460	6735940	Yeah.
6737140	6738180	I don't know.
6738180	6739860	He's the Merc with a Mouth.
6739860	6741060	The Merc with a Mouth.
6741060	6742820	Merc with a Mouth.
6742820	6745620	You know, like everyone shortens mercenary too.
6747220	6747700	Merc.
6749140	6750660	Just stop on that hard C.
6751780	6752340	Like you do.
6753060	6755540	Like just pretend you're saying the word mercenary and then just stop.
6755540	6757060	But he doesn't have a Mouth.
6757060	6758580	He has a Mouth.
6758580	6760420	But his face is a mouth.
6761380	6763060	His face is not a mask.
6764100	6766420	He wears a mask over his face.
6766980	6767940	Over his mouth.
6768740	6771380	Yeah, over the mouth that he absolutely has.
6773140	6773640	Yeah.
6775220	6777860	I haven't seen this movie.
6778580	6779940	He hates Francis.
6781220	6782500	You haven't seen Deadpool.
6782500	6783940	You definitely haven't seen the movie.
6783940	6788020	You're such a fucking old shitty fucking.
6788020	6789140	Colossus is in it.
6790180	6790740	I don't need.
6792180	6793540	What do you watch, The Mentalist?
6795460	6796740	That's Donald Glover's joke.
6798900	6802260	Have fun eating fiber and watching The Mentalist.
6802260	6805460	Rob, watch his old Colecovision commercials.
6805460	6805940	All right.
6806740	6807620	Okay.
6807620	6808100	All right.
6808660	6808980	This.
6809620	6810180	That's not a this.
6810180	6811700	Look, Jeff's not here.
6811700	6814420	He's the one that usually knows how to end the show.
6814420	6815220	Cliff Hanger.
6816260	6817460	I guess he doesn't really know.
6819700	6819940	Okay.
6819940	6820900	Good night, everybody.
6822500	6823300	Brian Krause.
6824980	6826740	Cold case murder mystery files.
6828340	6829220	I got it right, right?
6830260	6832020	Cold case murder mysteries.
6832020	6833940	Cold case murder mysteries.
6833940	6834900	There's no files.
6835700	6841780	Not Colgate like the toothpaste cold case, right?
6841780	6842420	Not Colgate.
6842420	6842820	Yeah.
6842820	6843300	Thank you.
6843300	6843780	All right.
6843780	6844020	All right.
6844020	6845620	We're putting that on bees.
6846660	6847780	Rob Schraff.
6847780	6848500	Thank you so much.
6848500	6849940	We'll see you next time.
6849940	6850820	Thanks for coming out.
6850820	6851380	Drive safe.
6852900	6854740	Take a take a buddy to your car.
6854740	6858500	It's a terrible neighborhood.
6864900	6885300	Did you get any of that?
6885300	6890980	It's a good a show.
