0	22840	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hollywood, California, and the world-famous Meltdown
22840	32200	Comics, and the even more famous Meltdown Theater, where the vodka and ice are brought
32200	34280	with great and long.
34280	61800	Mr. Harmon Towne, welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmon Towne, Mr. Dan Harmon.
61800	77000	I watched season four.
77000	84560	I guess I already knew this, but apparently I'm quite a genius.
84560	91040	Not a fan?
91040	100880	I think I feel pretty comfortable expressing any kind of like, not my cup of tea about
100880	108560	it because this has been expressed a thousand times over.
108560	113960	It's obviously not somebody doing what they do and trying really hard to make people happy.
113960	120840	It is very much like an impression and an unflattering one.
120840	136960	It's just 13 episodes of, oh, I'm Dan Harmon, die-hard, and I feel like I'm going back to
136960	142680	work tomorrow morning and I just feel like, do I talk like that?
142680	148680	It's weird to think about the fork in the road before one in this situation, a situation
148680	159680	which is very unique because the weird thing that keeps eating at me is there's a system
159680	167600	in place that's winning because I would have had too much leverage, too much power, too
167600	172960	much salary as would have a lot of writers coming into season four, so they just flushed
172960	179160	us, replaced us with two guys, didn't know what they were getting into, went to Comic-Con,
179160	180720	saw what was going on.
180720	186840	People dressed as space men and bananas and shit and going, holy shit, I cut myself every
186840	193960	night and watch Community and they went, fuck, and then I think they tried their best and
193960	201880	I think that was the best idea, well, not the best idea as it turns out, but the most
201880	205160	admirable kind of impulse was like, let's not let these people down.
205160	209720	If there's anything else we do, let's not let these people down.
209720	214800	So now you go back and I go, okay, well, watching that season, it's like I have such an impulse
214800	222200	to just do the show that they probably got hired to do.
222200	225980	They could have just done like a sitcom set at a community college and people would have
225980	229640	over time, people would have gone like, what about paintball?
229640	230640	What the fuck?
230640	235360	What about the chicken fingers?
235360	240200	But then five episodes later, regular people would have been like, oh, this is a pleasant
240200	245240	little show set at a Community College and they would have beaten me, the system would
245240	246240	have won.
246240	253120	I would have just crawled in her bridge and pooped in a bucket, just died, which is my
253120	254120	worst nightmare.
254120	258960	That's why I came to L.A. is because that's how I felt in high school, that's how I felt
258960	261840	in my parents' house.
261840	267880	My whole life is just me trying to get people to stop going, gross, just trying to trick
267880	269760	them into liking me.
269760	282720	It's just like, look, Joel McHale is saying something funny and the surprise is me.
282720	292360	The weird thing is, yeah, you go back, writers fighting other writers is the fucking American
292360	295280	dream in the eyes of Sony.
295280	296740	That is what they want.
296740	300220	They want creative people rewriting each other.
300220	302940	They want creative people replacing each other.
302940	305180	They want us interchangeable.
305180	309980	They want to think about writing the way they think about the guy on Assembly Line 24 that
309980	313140	puts the final screw in the fucking PlayStation.
313140	315740	They want to think about us all that way.
315740	319420	I shouldn't even say they because it's an it, it's a fucking machine.
319420	323060	There's not a single person that works at that corporation that isn't also thought of
323060	326300	like that by the fucking Skynet.
326300	330340	All of them, even the people that go, oh, that douchebag, that fucking idiot, that
330340	336740	vice president of fucking what's it, head up his ass, dick, shit, fucking fuckface,
336740	342140	international, like, so I can't wait for him to get fired and they're just going to replace
342140	343140	him with someone else.
343140	348540	This is some other fucking prep school frat ass fucking dipshit.
348540	353620	The system just wants us all just fucking not being human.
353620	358820	But they accidentally, you know, in the quest for to recoup their investment, they made
358820	366100	a TV show that with a bunch of actors that make people really happy and we got 13 more
366100	367100	episodes.
367100	372820	And it's like, you know, I like the idea that we've laced the opiates with just a little
372820	376460	bit of activation, a little bit of humanity and like, like, like when you watch that show
376460	381780	you maybe you'll go out and make a show of your own or something like that.
381780	387020	Do you feel pretty confident in your ability to go in there and like, you know, slam dunk
387020	388180	this next season?
388180	394300	No, no, I don't feel confident in my ability to slam dunk anything because I'll measure
394300	397100	the, you know, slam dunking by my own standards.
397100	403820	So the basket's always going to be one inch higher than I can jump because I have a weird
403820	404820	complex about that.
404820	410500	I want to do the best I can, but I mean, I think that how does it work is coming out
410500	414380	of that season that clearly is different than it was when you were there.
414380	419300	Like tonally, like your fans are going to be recognized that you're back.
419300	423020	They're going to hear, they're going to hear that, that tone again, hopefully, right?
423020	426820	And then, and that will be, yeah, they're going to feel my love and kisses.
426820	427820	Yeah.
427820	437060	But it won't be in the form of a fucking matrix, uh, spoof, like, I'm back, look at the wire.
437060	442140	It's like, I want, that's, that's not what I ever want.
442140	443140	You should do the wires.
443140	445140	You should do a wire spoof right out, right out of the bed.
445140	453300	I mean, I, I just, boy, man, watching those characters without me there as is not fucking
453300	454300	cool, man.
454300	459500	It was like, it's just like, just flipping through Instagram, just watching your girlfriend
459500	461780	just blow a million.
462780	465420	It's the worst.
465420	469700	It is like, like, all the comments underneath it, people going like, well, season three
469700	470700	kind of sucks.
470700	474460	How do you know this wouldn't happen anyway?
474460	475460	Fuck you.
475460	476460	Fuck you.
476460	479460	That's like, like, like, like if on Facebook, like if your girlfriend was with a new guy
479460	484500	and, and it's like, you know, sometimes it's like, like Joanna and Dean are in a relationship
484500	485780	and there's a heart icon.
485780	488780	And then like one of your friends is like, thumbs up.
488780	494060	Detroit likes this, like, hey, come on.
494060	496900	Don't even trip, dog.
496900	500500	All right.
500500	505580	I left a voicemail.
505580	510140	You guys know, you live in LA, so you probably know this legend of Bill Murray doesn't have
510140	511460	like representation.
511460	515580	He just has this 800 number on a voicemail line.
515580	517260	So I left a voicemail for him.
517860	519140	Well, I was watching season four.
519140	521580	I called him and left a voicemail.
521580	522580	What did you say?
522580	523580	I just said, call me back.
523580	526420	Like, like, you had to preamble it with who you were.
526420	527700	I said, I said, my name is Dan Harmon.
527700	530180	I created an NBC show called Community.
530180	539820	I would like to talk to you as soon as possible about the possibility of of you.
539820	540820	You stutter that much?
540820	544900	Yeah, probably.
545540	550700	I didn't want to try too hard or try to not try too hard, too hard.
550700	554420	Like, I just probably just sounded like a robot.
554420	561140	I was just like today on a plane with Joel Murray, his brother, the youngest Murray.
561140	565780	And he was saying that Bill has recently done a TV guest on something.
565780	570420	And before that, it was Silver Spoon or Different Strokes.
570420	571420	That's how long it was.
571420	574100	Silver Spoon was the movie that Silver Spoons was based on.
574820	575820	Was it Family Ties?
575820	579020	He was the alcoholic brother who ruined a corporation.
579020	580020	Is that right?
580020	581020	Yeah.
581020	582020	Adam Goldberg.
582020	585580	I mean, we can't verify if he's right or wrong yet.
585580	588580	Adam Goldberg for the sociopathic win.
588580	595620	He's Machiavellian, he doesn't care.
595620	598940	He contributed and they sneak out into the night and then we'll all be like, what?
598940	603980	There's no show called Family Ties.
603980	607620	But he'll be up to his neck and puss.
607620	613620	I'm talking to his neck and puss.
613620	615420	So I left a voicemail for Bill Murray.
615420	616420	Is there anything?
616420	618700	Do you know what happens next?
618700	619700	What's pursuant to that?
619700	626460	Bill Murray calls me back and we hang out.
626460	628380	Does he have somebody call you back?
628380	629380	Do you know how that works?
629380	630380	No.
631380	637660	I mean, he's like this weird, mysterious man.
637660	638660	I don't know.
638660	640380	I mean, ask the guys that made Zombieland.
640380	643500	I think they just called his number and left a message, I assume.
643500	644500	I don't know.
644500	648620	I think he just calls you back and goes like, hey, it's Bill Murray.
648620	649620	I don't know.
649620	653740	I know it's not going to happen to me, but I think it was a healthy exercise because
653740	656100	I was watching the Jeff Meets His Father episode.
656100	658780	Of course, I always wanted Jeff's father to be Bill Murray.
658780	663540	I kept putting off the meeting between Jeff and his father because I kept hoping that
663540	666660	somehow fate would allow for that to be the case.
666660	667660	I named him Jeff Winger.
667660	671580	His last name was Winger after Bill Murray's character in Stripes.
671580	677300	I just always thought that Jeff Winger's dad would be Bill Murray.
677300	683660	But there's something awesome about having any all of those preconceived notions kind
683660	686980	of ripped away from you.
686980	687980	It's exciting.
688180	692940	There's something awesome about being held down and watching your family get raped on
692940	694940	a beach.
694940	697740	It's liberating.
697740	700980	It makes you focus on what's important.
700980	706260	Happy Father's Day, by the way, everybody.
706260	709980	Did you call your dad today?
709980	712140	Yeah, I called my dad.
712140	716300	Erin was calling her dad, so I had nothing to do.
716300	717300	I called my dad.
717500	723660	My dad, one of the coolest things about him is the second coolest thing about him is that
723660	728740	he knows how to do a quick surgical Father's Day call.
728740	733380	He's wanting to get off the phone as soon as I am, no sooner, no later.
733380	738780	Erin's dad will just hang up on her, which is a weird fantasy we all have.
738780	741940	I wish my dad wanted to talk less.
741940	744540	But her dad is like ... Her dad ...
744660	746260	Because she goes on and on or because ...
746260	747260	No.
747260	748260	Well, I'm sure she does.
748260	755900	But Erin's dad, by her report, has this weird phone behavior that is similar to people in
755900	758900	TV and movies, the way they never say goodbye or hello.
758900	762580	They just go, okay, well, I'll see you then.
762580	764660	He just hangs up on her all the time.
764660	767260	You can ask her about it later.
767260	771020	My dad ... Because it is Father's Day, I do want to ... Because I talk so much sometimes
771020	775740	when I'm talking to a microphone, because a hamster that knows which lever gives him
775740	784300	a treat ... I know that my parents were 70s hands-on parents, and I know that it's such
784300	789060	a fucking button you can push to make people go, oh, that's so cool.
789060	792300	Your dad hit you once.
792300	796540	I think all of our parents were dicks, and the thing about being a parent is that it's
796540	799060	a thankless fucking job.
799060	800780	If you're doing it right, it's thankless.
800860	805860	I think everybody in LA and everybody in our generation probably is starting to realize
805860	810980	that there's an epidemic among generation acts of parents who try to be their kid's
810980	817100	best friend, try to be perfect, and we're all seeing how those kids are turning out.
817100	822060	Parenting, when you atone with the father, as Joseph Campbell would say, you become an
822060	823740	impersonal cosmic force.
823740	827260	You make it sunny, you make it rain.
827260	831140	The kid is never really going to do anything but complain when it's raining and do nothing
831140	835900	when the sun is shining, and your best reward is that they grow up into a human being, and
835900	839340	they go out in the world, and they're not ... we're human beings.
839340	844940	How often do you, in the midst of your awesomeness, do you stop and go, good thing my parents
844940	847180	were born?
847180	850580	You're all about yourself, and you're on your own little adventure, and your parents at
850580	857020	best are like, you remember fun things about the warm little cuddly memories, or them just
857020	859700	hitting you with a belt.
859700	870500	My dad, I will say, because I've never ... it takes too much longer, and it's not as easy
870500	877460	to say, holy shit, my dad was awesome, in very, very specific ways.
877460	884120	Your father, if you're lucky enough to have one, is the first guy you meet.
884120	886060	He is your male role model.
886060	889980	That means that the way that he treats women is ... it's not necessarily how you're going
889980	894580	to treat women, but it is the first instance of a man treating a woman some way that you
894580	895580	witness.
895580	902780	I think I owe all of my fights with Aaron to the fact that I found a woman that has
902780	909420	a semi-compatible understanding of how a man and a woman fight constantly, and we enact
909420	913060	these dramas and all this stuff.
913060	916420	If you go to enough therapy, you can wipe that out, you can recondition yourself.
916420	920700	As I've always said, Hitler's dad didn't kill 12 million Jews, and if Hitler had a son,
920700	922900	he wouldn't kill three million.
922900	926540	It doesn't work that way.
926540	933980	One can be different from how they were raised or who they were raised by, but the stuff
933980	939140	that works, because there's no reason for you to overcome it, that's the stuff that
939140	940140	really counts.
940140	950700	I think my dad's ... the coolest thing about him was he was just a self-made man.
950700	953020	He wasn't like Rodney Dangerfield in Caddyshack.
953020	956580	It wasn't like, fuck you, society.
956580	968820	He was so low-born, my dad, that he never even got the cockiness to do it out of spite.
968820	975300	He only just knew that no one would ever help you unless you helped yourself.
975300	982500	Every piece of wisdom I ever got from him while I watched him earn the money that we
982500	990660	used to buy our food, and all the messaging that went into my brain about what a man's
990660	998540	role is in this world and within his family was very, very strong, positive messaging,
998540	1004540	because my dad was a bootstrapper and just died in the wool.
1004540	1006100	Fuck rich people.
1006100	1007140	Fuck kissing ass.
1007140	1010780	My dad said ... I interviewed him for a sixth grade project.
1010780	1017780	He was like, interview your dad, and ask him 10 questions or something, and I asked ... I
1017780	1020980	was a little sixth grade journalist, and I interviewed him in the basement where he would
1020980	1028420	hide and make stained glass and try to forget about how much his dad hid him.
1028420	1036060	He would always wear this V-neck Haynes t-shirt with a Sharpie pen clipped to the collar,
1036060	1041420	because he would just take the Sharpie pen and mark it all over the place.
1041420	1045700	I know that I'm also famous for sticking the Sharpie pen up my ass.
1045700	1053340	It's really not related, I don't think, but it smells like origin story.
1053340	1059220	Certainly in the hands of a Christopher Nolan, like this is starting to come together.
1059220	1063580	But I remember my dad sitting behind this desk in this dark basement while I sat there
1063580	1068460	and tried to fulfill the obligations of this elementary school interview project.
1068460	1071780	I said, what's your advice to young people?
1071780	1075860	My dad said, don't kiss anyone's ass.
1075860	1079220	Don't do it.
1079220	1083860	For the rest of your life, everyone will always tell you, pick your battles, kiss a little
1083860	1087100	bit of ass, and then you get to stop kissing ass later.
1087100	1088220	It's a lie.
1088220	1090060	They all just want their ass kissed.
1090060	1094020	They think that if they tell you that, they're going to get to kiss less ass too.
1094020	1095180	It's all garbage.
1095180	1096460	It's all bullshit.
1096460	1098500	You have to just do everything yourself.
1098500	1102060	That's pretty spicy stuff for a sixth grade project.
1102060	1105620	Yeah, but he didn't, in that regard, he didn't...
1105620	1107740	He wasn't kissing your sixth grade teacher's ass.
1107740	1109140	He wasn't kissing my ass.
1109140	1110820	He wasn't talking down to me.
1110820	1112860	He wasn't sugarcoating it.
1112860	1114420	He's talking to another little guy.
1114420	1118020	I think in a lot of ways, my dad was...
1118020	1125020	I can clearly see sometimes when I talk to his biological mom about his childhood, you
1125020	1127700	think about your dad as a child.
1127700	1133220	That's the atonement with the father, when you realize that your dad was once an animal
1133220	1135420	out there trying to figure things out.
1135420	1137860	I remember talking to his mom about...
1137860	1144620	She told me this story about how my dad and the trailer park they grew up in, he loved
1144620	1147100	money because they didn't have any.
1147100	1149780	He didn't love it like Scrooge McDuck loves it.
1149780	1157460	He loved it like the monkeys in 2001 love a monolith.
1157460	1162060	He'd have six single dollars and he'd keep them in a coffee can and he would iron them
1162060	1167300	and wash them and stack them up and count them.
1167300	1172900	He kept them in a coffee can and then had a special spot where he buried them because
1172900	1176980	he wouldn't keep them in the trailer where he lived because that was less safe than burying
1176980	1180820	it like an animal because of the guys his mom would bring home.
1180820	1188460	He had buried treasure and then at some point someone got wise and probably saw him.
1188460	1192820	I think I told my dad the story and my dad was like, no, that was that fucking guy.
1192820	1199340	My dad knew who dug up his coffee can and my dad was all...
1199340	1203060	His mom was telling me this story when I was in my 20s and I was like, holy shit, my dad
1203060	1210300	was like a little guy with a coffee can of dollars that got taken from him.
1210300	1213420	He was bullied, he was up against all odds.
1213420	1215300	My dad survived the polio epidemic.
1216300	1224980	One of his legs is withered because so many of his peers, they got wiped out in this epidemic
1224980	1230220	in the 50s but he survived it but it cost him a bunch of muscle tissue in one of his
1230220	1231220	legs.
1231220	1236740	This kind of burly guy with these Popeye forearms and this big red mustache and he walks with
1236740	1237740	this limp.
1237740	1243660	The limp somehow always made him more foreboding than if he walked like a regular guy.
1243660	1244940	What was your phone call like today?
1244940	1248620	It was dumb, boring.
1248620	1249620	Fuck that guy.
1249620	1259180	No, no, it's just, it's terse, you know, I don't, my dad and I, like, I remember...
1259180	1271420	I remember being in my 20s and being back in Milwaukee for some reason and my...
1271420	1275140	I took a tour with my dad of this facility.
1275140	1276140	Here's the thing about my dad.
1276140	1280940	My dad was the video duplication king of the Midwest.
1280940	1288180	He started out mopping floors at a film lab in Milwaukee and it was sort of like the boogie
1288180	1289980	nights thing.
1289980	1294620	There was this new thing called VHS that started happening and my dad told his boss, like,
1294620	1299740	I think that VHS is going to probably make a lot of this stuff obsolete, all this, like,
1299740	1303260	film duplication that we're doing, these slides that we're making for people who have
1303260	1310140	cooking instruction videos or whatever.
1310140	1316020	And his boss was like, eh, come on, you know, whatever, like, celluloid, who will ever defeat
1316020	1319420	that for the transmission of information?
1319420	1325660	And my dad started his own company which meant that he took two VCRs and hooked them together
1325660	1332060	in my bedroom and duplicated a tape ten times for one client that needed, like, a how to
1332060	1337380	make bread video duplicated or something, got enough money to buy two more VCRs and
1337380	1343020	then he rented a small office space and had two racks of VCRs and was siphoning clients
1343020	1347460	off of this company that he used to work for because they're all going, oh, shit, VHS,
1347460	1349100	this is where we're going.
1349100	1356980	And so my dad started that, rode that wave, started his own business, like, ended up having
1356980	1364340	like 50 employees in a big building and making his own, you know, VHS tapes in, like, a part
1364340	1368820	of the building, like, really just, like, did it, you know, like, took that business
1368820	1375020	to its peak, sold it to his biggest competitor who was, like, the video king of America,
1375020	1378180	and then just his DVDs came along.
1378180	1386520	So there was a guy that worked for my dad who started his own business after my dad
1386520	1388180	sold his.
1388180	1394060	He had a DVD duplication facility and I was back in Milwaukee and I walked around with
1394060	1399980	my dad and this guy who was basically my age, but he was this guy that had worked for my
1399980	1407260	dad for years and the guy was showing him the DVD duplication facility that he had created,
1407260	1414980	this little ragamuffin kind of, like, six employee kind of operation and my dad was
1414980	1420780	looking around and he got the whole tour and he went, huh, yeah, it's a pretty good operation
1420780	1422340	you got going here.
1422340	1428980	And the guy said, yeah, I learned from the best and I fucking, my eyes involuntarily
1428980	1434660	started squirting water and my heart, like, it's called crying, Dan.
1435660	1439180	Look, water is leaking from their eyes.
1439180	1440180	It's called tears.
1440180	1444540	It is a symbol of their weakness.
1444540	1448060	Ming the Merciless.
1448060	1452380	Because I realized, oh shit, oh God, this guy that came home at 10 p.m. every night,
1452380	1456940	he was fathering people that it was, it was easier to father, you know, it was basic and
1456940	1460620	on, like, what do you do?
1460620	1461620	And do you do it well?
1462060	1466020	You didn't cry because you were proud of your father, you cried because you were, like,
1466020	1467580	he had other surrogate children?
1467580	1472500	I cried because I suddenly, I just did this flood of realization, like, when you're a
1472500	1478820	kid and your dad goes to work and then your dad works that hard, you think of work as
1478820	1484620	being a Beetlejuice void outside the door where there's sand worms and time doesn't
1484620	1486340	exist out there.
1486340	1490300	And in that moment I suddenly, it was like a sitcom epiphany where it was like, oh no,
1490300	1492140	work was family.
1492140	1499700	Work was young men who looked up to him and who were, he was able to connect with because
1499700	1503140	they weren't his sons.
1503140	1509260	And he was, and they looked at him as an important man and tried to impress him and regarded
1509260	1514780	his favor as worthwhile, whereas he had a much more complicated, messy relationship
1514780	1520100	with the guy that was generated from one of his loads, you know, like, how are we ever
1520100	1527780	gonna have that traditional father-son relationship when, you know, he, like, work was what meant
1527780	1529060	everything to him.
1529060	1534620	And then cut to him coming to LA for the first time and it was back when Channel 101 had
1534620	1539940	just gotten a pilot on VH1 and we were all hanging out in a bar, all these Channel 101
1539940	1547860	kids and, like, I, my dad, like, I walked him out to his car after he spent that time,
1547860	1549700	you met him that night at the bar.
1549700	1552620	And it was like, we were just celebrating the fact that, oh, God, we got, we're gonna
1552620	1556940	do a sketch show that's based on Channel 101, we've been doing this thing for no money forever
1556940	1561620	and now we're gonna do a couple episodes of this thing on this basic cable show and station.
1561620	1566740	And then we went out to the car and my dad was like, I can't remember what he said, he's
1566740	1571460	like, ah, it's pretty impressive, got a lot of people in there and they're very, look
1571460	1573140	up to you a lot.
1573140	1580620	And I was like, yeah, well, I, I mean, that's, that's, I just, you know, wanted to be you.
1580620	1586300	Like, like that, that's what I, that's all I understand a man to be.
1586300	1593300	And like, I just hugged him and, like, the, when you asked the question how was the phone
1593300	1598420	call for Father's Day, it was like, it's nothing, it's like, have you eaten any deviled eggs
1598420	1599420	lately?
1599420	1600420	Yes, I have.
1600420	1601420	They're good.
1601420	1602420	Yeah.
1602700	1603700	They're so deviled.
1603700	1608340	I, I gotta go by like, like, it's not, it's not even like there's like a well of emotion
1608340	1609500	pushing against a dam.
1609500	1616120	It's just like, it's never, it's, that's not the, that's not the channel through which
1616120	1621300	my admiration for him, my connection with him is ever going to exist.
1621300	1628620	That unconditional, weird, like mammalian love, like where it's just like, oh, my dad
1628620	1631860	took my fishes, throw, showed me how to throw a ball.
1631900	1633740	My dad was crippled.
1633740	1634900	He didn't know how to throw a ball.
1634900	1637380	He was a nerd like me.
1637380	1643180	We did, you know, it's, but it's technical.
1643180	1648980	The there's, there's so much love there, so much, so much important, so much aberration,
1648980	1655340	but it's going through like channels on the circuit board that are not designed to carry
1655340	1657460	that signal.
1657460	1662900	You're putting, you're putting hugs through a fucking fiber optic wire, but the stuff
1662900	1663900	is getting through there.
1663900	1671060	And then sometimes it's, and then it's, I don't know, how old does he know, 30.
1671060	1672860	He also invented time travel.
1672860	1673860	I buried the lead on this.
1673860	1674860	I don't know.
1674860	1675860	He's probably 60.
1675860	1678860	I'm a bad son.
1678860	1679860	I don't know.
1679860	1680980	I don't know what color his eyes are.
1680980	1681980	I don't know.
1681980	1685460	My dad, like, you know, he was like the super dad.
1685460	1687820	He was 40 or 41 when he had me.
1687820	1690900	And so I've always known him with like, he just looked like, you know, George Clooney
1690900	1693700	had salt and pepper hair and he, like, he could throw.
1693700	1697220	He taught me how to throw a fucking curveball when you weren't allowed to in little league
1697220	1701020	because it was bad for your arm, which is why my right arm is no range of movement.
1701020	1704860	Like I can scratch the back of my head with my left arm and I, my right arm doesn't do
1704860	1709500	anything because like I could throw a wicked breaking ball as a child.
1709500	1712300	They found out that throwing balls is bad for kids arms.
1712300	1715740	They said like, you're not allowed to throw curveballs because it's a really unnatural
1715740	1718020	movement on your shoulder and elbows and stuff.
1718020	1721580	And so I like crazy like, you know, I played tennis and stuff, but like also like he could
1721580	1723100	fix anything, do anything.
1723100	1727140	He was like Monpah Joe, like he moved west from Nebraska and I was just in Nebraska two
1727140	1732940	days ago, 50 miles away from the Davis farm where he was born in between two towns.
1732940	1738500	And like they really moved during the Dust Bowl and he farmed beans and hops and whatever
1738500	1741180	grew and he went to Oregon and came down to California.
1741180	1746180	And then by the time he was a teenager, he had like a hit a car and he went and went
1746180	1750820	to the Korean war and then came back and he was like this really groovy Californian guy,
1750820	1753460	but he can build and do anything.
1753460	1755100	He's like a fuck off artist.
1755100	1760980	He can draw or paint, sculpt, like anything with his hands, he can do engineering of any
1760980	1761980	sort.
1761980	1765100	If a horse nearby was winning and he goes, the horse is giving birth.
1765100	1766100	I'll be right back.
1766100	1767100	He's the guy that could do it.
1767100	1773620	The guy that if the captain and the navigator and the copilot all had bad fish and the planes
1773620	1778780	going down, the fuselage of the plane would instinctively look at my dad and go, that's
1778780	1779780	our man.
1779780	1784580	And he's 80 years old, but he's like, he came and saw a show I did in Vegas with Drew Carey
1784580	1790340	and the who's lying gang and he's, you know, white hair, like, you know, like kind of a
1790340	1793900	turtleneck and a jacket and he's kind of suave looking and we're just having a conversation
1793900	1800740	and women that were younger than me, my age, older than me, his age, kept crossing the
1800740	1803460	casino to come up to him and say, excuse me, I'm sorry.
1803460	1807660	We have to tell you, you're the most debonair man we've ever seen in our life and he doesn't
1807660	1808660	have a big mouth.
1808660	1809660	I talked too much.
1809660	1810660	My dad doesn't.
1810660	1813540	He just sits there and looks like he could land the plane and he's the fucking best.
1813540	1819700	I've met him like for the podcast listeners, I think like, like, this is probably a oversimplified,
1819700	1825700	but just so you have a visual, like, Jeff's dad, kind of like J. Peterman from Seinfeld.
1825700	1835180	Yeah, I think I know who you're talking about, yeah, but like, we were like, we were kids
1835180	1841500	were in Maui on a vacation and someone yelled on the beach like, there's a woman out there.
1841500	1842500	She's drowning.
1842500	1846540	There's an old lady that got swept up in the curtains.
1846540	1847540	She was just floating out.
1847540	1849660	There was a dead woman out there.
1849660	1853740	And I just remember that moment of like, people just look around like, what are we going to
1853740	1854740	do?
1854740	1859540	And then before you can even look back, my dad is out there and he pulls her in and he's
1859540	1860540	giving her CPR.
1860540	1861540	She was dead.
1861540	1864100	It was like, it was, there was no, no helping it.
1864100	1868220	But it was just like, like, my memory of my dad is like, he could fucking do anything.
1868220	1873020	Like, if this room caught fire, we'd all sit here and go, oh, Jesus, we're going to die.
1873020	1876260	But if my dad were in the room and you hadn't seen him yet, you would just instinctively
1876260	1878020	turn around and go, there he is.
1878020	1881340	And my dad would look around and he would stick his tongue out slightly.
1881340	1886700	Like, it was tongue would go out a little bit and that meant, I'll fix it.
1886700	1891340	And I told my dad like years ago, like, you know, he's stoic.
1891340	1892540	He's working class.
1892540	1897940	He's a hard worker and he's not a really emotional, like, my mom was really emotional.
1897940	1899500	I'm more her emotionally.
1899500	1902140	I cry watching you talk about your dad right now.
1902140	1904700	Like, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'm the first one to cry.
1904700	1907140	My dad is very stoic, but not like in a tough ass way.
1907140	1909100	He's just, you know, he keeps it in.
1909100	1915140	And I told him one time, I wrote him a big card to say, like, how much I love him.
1915140	1917140	And I'm going to start crying.
1917140	1918140	I warned you already.
1918140	1920580	And I wrote him, I'll try not to, but I wrote him this big card.
1920580	1922220	It's like, no, fuck, this is stupid.
1922220	1923220	I'll just call him.
1923220	1926580	So I called him up and told him how much I loved him, how much I looked up to him.
1926580	1927580	And he was like, what?
1927580	1931620	I was like, dad, all I do is brag about you.
1931620	1932620	I listened to my friend's story.
1932620	1935140	You said I was a booger eating turd monster.
1935140	1939380	I was, I was two, I was two years old.
1939380	1942620	I didn't have the word power.
1942620	1945620	You were back then a booger eating turd monster.
1945620	1946620	Now you're a hero.
1946620	1949740	But I told him, I said, like, compared to my friend's dad's, like, you hear these stories,
1949740	1953540	there's these conflicts and these battles and like the distance and stuff.
1953540	1960140	I said, like, if I grow up to be like half or like a third of the man, a third of the
1960140	1964900	father, if I had a third of your work ethic, I'd be the coolest person in the world.
1964900	1966580	Like currently, like other than you.
1966580	1969900	If I could smash a third of the puss.
1969900	1971460	Oh, yeah.
1971460	1972860	My dad got drunk one time.
1972860	1973860	Who are you there?
1973860	1976020	We went out and had drinks one time.
1976020	1979100	My dad lives near Laguna Beach.
1979100	1982200	And Dan and I went there and I had to take a stupid business call and I came back in
1982200	1984620	and they were like best friends.
1984620	1989060	And my dad had a couple of beers and started telling a story that was like the sexiest,
1989060	1991020	like getting laid story of all the time.
1991020	1992020	I'd never heard it before.
1992020	1994260	But the thing is, like, I'd never been out with the boys.
1994260	1998500	It was just, you know, me and like, it's usually family stuff, but he told this amazing story
1998500	2001300	and like, you also know that that's not the beginning of it.
2001300	2002740	Like he clearly is.
2002740	2004580	I told my dad, like, we're getting less masher.
2004580	2008700	He's a professional puss masher.
2008700	2010140	The Davises are getting less cool.
2010140	2011500	I'm the least cool David.
2011500	2013300	My brother's better than me.
2013300	2016660	The Mayan calendar, it's yeah, it's we're in the seventh world.
2016660	2017660	It's like.
2017780	2021140	But I went to Nebraska and I'm meeting people and you walk down the street and you see people
2021140	2024020	that kind of walk tall and they're very sweet and they're very nice and they're very focused
2024020	2028420	and they seem to enjoy their lives out there in a way that like if you go to a restaurant
2028420	2030900	here in L.A., people don't like what they're doing.
2030900	2032780	They've got to be something else.
2032780	2033780	They're not a waitress.
2033780	2034780	They're not a fucking actor.
2034780	2035780	I don't do commercials.
2035780	2036780	I'm a film actor.
2036780	2041900	Like, everyone's bigger than what they're currently doing so nobody's ever fucking pleased
2041900	2043500	with themselves.
2043500	2045460	And that's a good thing too.
2045460	2047220	I mean, like, ambition can be good.
2047220	2048220	It can be bad.
2048220	2051900	But it was really cool like being 50 miles away from where my dad was born.
2051900	2054340	My grandma told me a story because my grandma was the coolest.
2054340	2056620	She died like when she was 87, I think.
2056620	2061740	And the smartest, funniest and just tough as fucking nails and never had a sniffle in
2061740	2065940	her life until she was so old that she just, you know, like, I'm just going to slowly fall
2065940	2068500	asleep and die with a smile on my face.
2068500	2070340	And she was the coolest.
2070340	2071980	And she said she made these beans.
2071980	2075780	She made red beans and I would go to her house and I was broke.
2075780	2077540	I was in high school and college, I had no money.
2077540	2080380	And I would go there and she'd always have this big ass kettle of beans in the fridge.
2080380	2084420	And it was the most delicious thing I'd ever had in my life since I was a baby.
2084420	2085420	I loved it.
2085420	2086860	And she'd always make them for me.
2086860	2089300	And one day she's looking at me and she's like, you really like those beans?
2089300	2091420	And I said, this is my favorite thing in the world.
2091420	2093780	And she goes, that's so funny.
2093780	2095780	It's like, I feel so bad about that.
2095780	2100660	It's like when I was, when your father was a little boy, we were, you know, we were like
2100660	2104340	in the dust bowl and we were traveling, just itinerant farmers.
2104340	2105540	That's all we had.
2105540	2109620	All you had was food that you could dry and put a little water on and make something out
2109620	2110620	of it.
2110620	2111620	So she's really good at making beans delicious.
2111620	2115300	And he's like, we ate beans for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
2115300	2118660	And your father loved them every meal and he would come in and he would sing a little
2118660	2122380	song and he would go, cook up beans, cook up beans, cook up beans and he'd do a little
2122380	2123380	jig in the kitchen.
2123380	2128180	And she would like cry because she's like, like you should be having meat, like you should
2128180	2129180	be eating something.
2129180	2134820	And she goes, and if there was ever a chicken, if it was in August, that was Thanksgiving
2134820	2136740	because there was not going to be a chicken.
2136740	2141100	And so she's like, and she, like my grandma was too old and too cool and too way too stoic
2141100	2142100	to start crying about that.
2142100	2144140	She's like, yeah, I felt like a bad mom.
2144140	2147540	Like because, you know, I couldn't believe your dad liked beans that much.
2147540	2152740	It's like, well, you fucking make really good beans.
2152740	2153740	Edward.
2153740	2154740	Nigga.
2154740	2164260	Uh, yeah, I want to, I actually want to, I want to keep the touching father's day theme
2164260	2166740	going with a special guest in a minute.
2166740	2172500	But I also want to, I just kind of like, uh, someone, someone did a sarcastic wolf whistle.
2172500	2176060	Ooh, father's day episode.
2176060	2178460	This thing's really heating up.
2178460	2180140	They think Chevy Chase is coming up.
2180140	2183940	And by the way, I think it's like, uh, I think it's like a post 25 thing, not to make a sweeping
2183940	2187740	generalization, but I think probably this audience being your demographic, people are
2187740	2192420	coming out on Sunday night to a comic book store to watch fat guy that got fired and
2192420	2193420	blah, blah, blah.
2193420	2197820	Like you, you're, you're, you're cussing on that age when, when you're, you're going
2197820	2200580	to start getting melodramatic about your, your parents.
2200580	2204620	And it doesn't, I mean, honestly, like I, nobody, like, like, like they, you're allowed
2204620	2205620	to think they're assholes.
2205620	2210300	Like it's not, nothing drove me more nuts than people complain about my family and people
2210300	2212700	go, yeah, but that's your family.
2212700	2213700	That's all you've got.
2213700	2219900	And I'd be like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck them, like, like, like, like,
2219900	2223260	like you're better than my family because I'm allowed to walk away from you.
2223260	2226540	And I'm going to do that now because you just told me to love my family.
2226540	2232260	Like, there's 25 year olds, dude, were there spankings?
2232260	2238340	There were no 50 50 eruption of yeah, yes, as a nose.
2238340	2241180	I mean, there was fucking corporal punishment when we were kids.
2241180	2245460	I don't think now, like you see kids, I was in a, when I flew out to this gig, we're in
2245460	2248820	first class and there was a woman in front with a, with a two year old child who's going
2248820	2252020	to have the ear popping thing and the child's going to be miserable and we all know that.
2252020	2257140	And so no one's going to be a bad, no one's going to go, oh, geez, kid, first class, because
2257140	2258140	it's a small enough plane.
2258140	2260140	It's going to be a crying kid no matter what.
2260140	2261540	But the kid wasn't the problem.
2261540	2265940	The mother was a piece of garbage and she was up and down and her ranging the flight
2265940	2270420	staff and apologizing to everybody about her kid is like, the kids, the kids too.
2270420	2271420	You're an asshole.
2271420	2272420	You're a bad mom.
2272420	2275540	And then we found out when they all got up at the end of it, the father and the older
2275540	2278260	daughter were sitting right behind them and never said a word.
2278260	2280980	They just, they just played a cool and let this poor woman run around.
2280980	2283180	I was like, I wanted to punch me and everybody.
2283180	2284180	It was the worst.
2284180	2286180	I remember flying as a kid.
2286180	2289700	I didn't cry because I knew if I did, I would be on the fucking wing.
2289700	2294540	Like there was, you did not, you were not allowed to be an asshole kid back when spanking
2294540	2296860	was like, like legit.
2296860	2299140	All right.
2299140	2302500	So we have a, we have a son that we've adopted here at Harbin town.
2302500	2303500	I like to think so.
2303500	2304500	His name is Spencer.
2304500	2305500	He's our dungeon master.
2305500	2308540	He's our, he's our, he's our, he's our, he's our boy.
2308540	2313780	But you know, he has a real father as well, who is here tonight and I was hoping he could
2313780	2315740	come up and we can have a little chat with him.
2315740	2322500	Andy, can you, are you willing to come up?
2322500	2330460	This is Spencer's dad, grab the father of our dungeon master, Spencer Crittenden, Andy
2330460	2333420	Crittenden, everybody.
2333420	2339100	So you are, you are the creator of the creator of, of worlds.
2339100	2347700	Oh yes, I, I did create him with a load.
2347700	2351540	World's grossest callback.
2351540	2357900	Isn't it amazing how little men have to endure at the actual inception?
2357900	2358900	You know, like that.
2358900	2361900	It's so funny because like, yeah, I mean, it's not so funny.
2361900	2367340	There's a certainly not new territory to tread, but it's like, but how much more seriously
2367340	2368340	we take it.
2368340	2372420	And I don't, I don't think, I don't think we shouldn't take it seriously.
2372420	2378900	I find, I think that like, especially when I started getting into Joseph Campbell and
2378900	2384220	stuff, like, like the theme that kept flying off of these pages to me was like, oh, we have
2384220	2387540	lost the father-son axis.
2387540	2392500	We have, we have lost this, this, this power that they, because like, if a, if a father
2392500	2399380	loves his son or the fuck loves, like if a father and son respect each other, that, that
2399380	2405780	like line of power, like that you see in Star Wars and stuff, even when the dad is a piece
2405780	2411780	of shit, the, the, it's so much more powerful than any system.
2411780	2414660	And I think that I don't, I don't believe in conspiracies.
2414660	2417420	I don't think anybody's ever deliberately done anything because I don't think any human
2417420	2418420	being is smart enough to do it.
2418420	2420780	I think systems are smarter at doing what systems do.
2420780	2427460	I think systems have, are in the process of, of completely like dissolving the father-son
2427460	2428500	bond.
2428500	2433740	I think that, like, like, that we regard much the same as it was like, like, oh, those towers
2433740	2434740	blew up.
2434740	2435740	Who are those guys?
2435740	2437740	Well, there are a bunch of guys that are going to put funny things in their head.
2437740	2438740	They believe in God.
2438740	2441420	They, they think that God's going to give them a snake when they die.
2442340	2446300	Everybody go to Citibank and go to Toys R Us and just play cool.
2446300	2453580	Like wait, we're, we, things that are mythical and powerful and special that don't have anything
2453580	2458680	to do with a dollar changing hands, like the, this system that is driven by dollars changing
2458680	2463580	hands is like, like jumping on it and corroding it.
2463580	2468740	And that's why every prom night, every, every son, you know, has a drunken fucking wrestling
2468740	2473460	match with his dad on the kitchen floor because when he was 13 they didn't go out in the woods
2473460	2479420	and get circumcised on a tree stump.
2479420	2485540	Your thoughts, Spencer's dad?
2485540	2489660	Just a couple of thoughts about his birth, if I might.
2489660	2497660	He'll probably kill me for this later, but since he brought up circumcision, the, when,
2497660	2509980	when he was born, he was a really large baby and he came out and this was my second child.
2509980	2516500	He came out with like a beard, no, a giant red testicles.
2516500	2521220	I mean, these things were like, like the size of your heart.
2521220	2522820	They were the size of my heart.
2522820	2523820	Yeah.
2523820	2524820	Literally.
2525060	2527060	Oh, how romantic.
2527060	2530060	Which was a little bit worrisome, you know?
2530060	2533060	Wait, you mean the size of an adult human heart?
2533060	2535180	Yeah, no, they were, they were like a softball.
2535180	2537180	Like a little softball, you know?
2537180	2542020	I should point out, so most people in the audience don't work in the testicle industry.
2542020	2548420	The human heart is a standard unit of measure for, your son has three heart testicles.
2548420	2552300	You're saying that not each testicle was, it was, it was his own human heart.
2552300	2554100	The entire unit of both testicles.
2554100	2555100	Yeah, the whole sack and everything.
2555100	2558100	Human heart, so it was fist sized.
2558100	2566900	Yeah, so the other interesting thing about his birth was his mom had a C-section and
2566900	2572220	so when you have another C-section, they don't want to cut as far because, because of muscles
2572220	2573220	and everything.
2573220	2577140	So they don't cut as far as they did on the first C-section and he was bigger than our
2577140	2578340	first son.
2578340	2584620	And so as a result, he was actually looking around in the world before he was technically
2584620	2585620	born.
2585620	2588540	His head was out of, out of Diane's body.
2588540	2591780	We got this great kind of science fiction alien baby shot.
2591780	2595620	He's kind of just, you know, you got the blood and all.
2595620	2598380	This looks like Quacho from Total Recall.
2598380	2606160	And he's, he's just kind of looking around like, do I really want to come out?
2606160	2610280	And I think as we know, you know, some 24 years later, the answer is he probably wished
2610280	2611280	he had.
2611280	2612280	Yeah, I know.
2612280	2618400	He, he seems like a guy who, yeah, who considers all of this a, a, a, a, a barely tolerable
2618400	2619400	interruption.
2619400	2620400	Exactly.
2620400	2622600	As he does his father, by the way.
2622600	2628840	Well let's talk about that because I mean, you, you, you seem like a delightful guy.
2628840	2632680	Spencer is clearly a delightful guy.
2632680	2634840	But you're his father and he's your son.
2634840	2642080	So like, like, like what, I mean, like, we're in the green room and Spencer has that, like,
2642080	2648000	he has that Spencer face or Spencer lack of face on, and you're, you're, you're sitting
2648000	2651420	there and you're in your sneakers and you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're delighted
2651420	2654680	to be here and you're, you're, you're funny.
2654680	2659080	Like I'm trying, I want to ask Spencer, like, like, is your dad, is your, is your bum that
2659080	2660080	your dad's here?
2660080	2663840	Is he, is he, is he embarrassing you because like kids get embarrassed by their parents
2663840	2664840	by default?
2664840	2665840	It doesn't matter how cool they are.
2665840	2666840	It doesn't matter.
2666840	2669000	Like, like, and I just, what's my question?
2669000	2673680	I just like, like, like, what is a, what is it?
2673680	2674680	Okay.
2674680	2675680	Here's my question.
2675680	2683840	I would, because in my wildest dreams, I would have a, if I would were to have a son, I would,
2683840	2689480	I would be so relieved if the doctors could show me some kind of chronological sonogram
2689480	2694840	and go, you're going to have a Spencer, you know, you're going to, he's going to be, he's,
2694840	2700920	he's not, he's not going to be doing pull ups for a living.
2700920	2702640	He's going to design dungeons.
2702640	2708760	He's going to be very smart and fair and, and, and honest and have a high IQ and like
2708760	2717640	like, like, like, like, I would be so much happier about that than if they said, well,
2717640	2721000	Danny Tatum is going to come out and, you know, he'll be great.
2721000	2726000	People are going to love him in this movie and he'll be great at football.
2726000	2732360	So I kind of get the vibe that you like, you, but he's your son.
2732360	2736120	So do you, is there frustration there?
2736120	2737120	Do you?
2737120	2742120	Well, the hardest thing about Spencer is, is it's hard to raise a child who's twice
2742120	2744760	as smart as you.
2744760	2749160	You know, I mean, when he was like six or seven, he told us what he wanted to do for
2749160	2751040	his birthday party.
2751040	2756280	And then he proceeded to organize all the kids and he did like a, he got this little
2756280	2761080	Casio keyboard and they want to play a version of musical chairs and so I said, okay, let's
2761080	2762080	start.
2762080	2763080	He goes, no, dad.
2763080	2766760	And he took it away from me and he's like organizing the kids and doing all this stuff
2766760	2771520	and, and, uh, Nathan will sit over there.
2771520	2782480	The cake will be shaped like a skull, candles emerging from its eye sockets, eight obelisks
2782480	2785480	set aflame.
2785480	2788560	The power of my birth will be recognized.
2788560	2793840	But he, but he kind of had a twisted sense of humor.
2793840	2796800	We were, we were at the beach.
2796800	2800160	He was in junior high and we were at the beach and he got on his mind.
2800160	2803440	He wanted to, uh, catch a seagull.
2803440	2805300	So this is a mentor somewhere.
2805300	2806640	So how do you catch a seagull?
2806640	2811000	Well, like any animal, you set up some food and so he told us what to do, kind of half
2811000	2819120	buried himself in sand and then put a towel over himself and then we had like Cheetos
2819120	2826160	lined up about 10 feet away leading to right on top of his chest and then he waited and
2826160	2827160	he was very patient.
2827160	2829200	I mean, I would use a box.
2829200	2836920	It sounds like he wanted to catch and to terrify a seagull and I want to tell you all
2836920	2842280	of us humans, there's a reason we have, uh, these brows here because he caught the seagull
2842280	2848360	with the towel and wrapped it around and the seagull went and all Spencer could see is
2848360	2851440	like the seagulls throat coming at his eye.
2851440	2855640	And obviously this protected his eye from getting picked out at which point you realize
2855640	2861640	as a parent, this probably wasn't the smartest thing that you could do.
2861640	2866520	But so he caught the seagull and then, then I don't know why, but he had some string and
2866520	2875160	he tied it to his foot and then he kind of flew him around like a kite for the rest of
2875160	2877160	the day.
2877160	2879440	It's like that scene from Game of Thrones with a dragon.
2879440	2880440	Yeah.
2880920	2889080	Spencer Joffrey, uh, then you give him a crossbow for his 16th birthday and, uh, I mean, so
2889080	2890440	wait, wait, no, no, no.
2890440	2891800	What happened to the seagull?
2891800	2896800	Well, we decided that somebody might come along at a certain point and find us after
2896800	2900160	some people were kind of pointing their fingers at us and stuff.
2900160	2902200	I mean, do you just let it go and hit it?
2902200	2903200	Yeah.
2903200	2904960	Still got a string attached to it to this day.
2904960	2906400	Oh, probably so.
2906400	2910920	I mean, if you, if you ask Spencer a question about anything, it doesn't matter if you're
2910920	2915560	asking about his relationship with his father or the economy or what we should do next week
2915560	2918400	for D and D or how he's feeling or what he had for lunch.
2918400	2924960	I mean, he's, he's kind of got that, he's staring off into space and talking like this
2924960	2928800	and yeah, yeah, my dad's here.
2928800	2936720	And I, it's like, like, have you ever did I, I just, I like, is it a thankless job?
2936720	2940880	Like I was describing earlier, like, like, do you feel like, Hey, fuck you, man.
2940880	2948320	Like I'm your, I'm your dad, like, like, like, like, like, like, be a fan of mine.
2948320	2954000	It's somewhat thankless, but it's hard because he's right in that wheelhouse age you're talking
2954000	2958080	about where you see, you start to see a transition.
2958160	2963280	And, you know, I've been trying to get Spencer to move on with his life for a while.
2963280	2964280	Which he just has.
2964280	2965280	He's just moved out.
2965280	2966280	Yeah.
2966280	2967280	Yeah.
2967280	2971160	Like a month ago, I was, I've been trying for three years, but he thinks, he thinks
2971160	2978080	that's because I hate him and, and I'm like, well, to me, the biggest value of college
2978080	2983440	is that you're getting out of the house and learning to live on your own.
2983440	2986240	And you know, so, and he never, he didn't go to college.
2986240	2992160	He decided not to because, you know, he was, well, too smart, smarter than all of his
2992160	2993160	teachers.
2993160	2996360	And yeah, I went to college and it's not all that's cracked up to be.
2996360	2997360	Yeah.
2997360	2998360	Yeah.
2998360	3001200	And I went to college and got a degree and I say it's not all it's cracked up to be.
3001200	3002320	I dropped, I dropped out.
3002320	3006600	I started doing, I was doing, yeah, getting out of your parents' house was like the thing
3006600	3010960	that I needed to do is go smoke two packs of cigarettes a day and do stand up and drink
3010960	3011960	a lot.
3011960	3012960	And it was like, kind of fine.
3012960	3014960	It was like a, like a roulette ball.
3014960	3019200	You just need to get the world spinning underneath you and you get, you're just going to land
3019200	3024320	somewhere specific and it can't be your parents' house and it might, you know, who knows where
3024320	3025320	it's going to lead.
3025320	3028960	Well, I think I feel like we should bring, we should get Spencer up here because we need
3028960	3046480	to protect me.
3046480	3050320	It's a good looking crowd.
3050320	3052600	So when did your balls, uh, yeah, okay.
3052600	3055960	I got to clear something up real quick.
3055960	3060720	When I was looking around, uh, mid birth, I wasn't like, I'm not so sure I want to come
3060720	3061720	out here.
3061720	3070040	I was like, Hey guys, don't freak out, but my balls are huge.
3070040	3074800	I've been watching him for nine months.
3074800	3079840	I'm smart enough to know balls don't need to be this big.
3079840	3080840	They went back to normal.
3080840	3081840	Trust me.
3081840	3083560	I don't believe you.
3083560	3085040	It's going to be this whole movement.
3085040	3091080	Like show us your scrotal certificate, but yeah, or just take your balls out.
3091080	3093640	I'm behind a table.
3093640	3094640	Is there anything?
3094640	3101960	Meaning they're already out.
3101960	3104680	I've always had my suspicions.
3104680	3113520	Spencer has polyhedral balls, uh, 20 sides, um, the, uh, you're, you're, you're, you're
3113640	3115440	you just recently moved out of your place.
3115440	3121600	Uh, you were, you were living with your parents and now you're, and I don't know, like Spencer
3121600	3124440	was working on the back of the Apple store.
3124440	3130440	Now I'm bringing him on and then this doesn't seem like a glorious upgrade, but, uh, Spencer
3130440	3137840	is going to be my personal assistant as I'm working over at community, but really I wanted
3137840	3140600	to be like kind of an apprenticeship because you're a creative guy.
3140600	3143640	And I think you have, you have, you have writing aspirations and certainly have writing
3143640	3144640	potential.
3144640	3146760	And I think I, I kind of trust you.
3146760	3150720	Like I always have a difficulty with, uh, well, like, like, like when you're, you have
3150720	3155120	an assistant, like, like, I, I, like what I was talking earlier about how my dad's the
3155120	3156600	trailer park and blah, blah, blah.
3156600	3159840	Don't kiss anyone's ass part, part of what comes with that is like, don't tell other
3159840	3160840	people what to do.
3160840	3162440	Don't be a fucking Dick.
3162440	3165360	Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, you don't have it or write like, like, and
3165360	3170520	that really gets in the way of delegating rooms full of writers and having someone get you
3170520	3172680	coffee and all this stuff.
3172680	3175720	You feel like you want to apologize every time you ask someone to do something, but
3175720	3179320	that just makes it more uncharismatic and like oftentimes you're just doing more harm
3179320	3180560	than good.
3180560	3185440	My point being, uh, yeah, I mean, uh, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna follow me
3185440	3190920	around now and you're gonna sit in the writer's room and, uh, and, uh, sit there with your
3190920	3198280	beard and, uh, and, and watch me work with the writers on, uh, on, uh, community.
3198800	3203040	It's a crazy trajectory because you came to Harmon Town, Spencer, you know, with, uh,
3203040	3206520	without telling anybody that you, that you really felt like you should be playing D&D
3206520	3207520	with Dan Harmon.
3207520	3213680	Then that night he says, anybody here, Dungeon Master, you do, you come up, you're in the
3213680	3218520	show, we go on tour together, uh, and you're, you're a huge part of our show now.
3218520	3224040	And now like, it's like, we've taken him away from Andy here, you know, he's moved out to
3224040	3225040	Hollywood.
3225040	3227520	But Andy was pushing that rock out the door for three years.
3227880	3231800	I wish I lived where Spencer does right now, down the street from Paramount.
3231800	3234280	So, yeah, that's going to be perfect.
3234280	3235280	Yeah.
3235280	3236280	Just down the street.
3236280	3238280	I'm still processing it.
3238280	3239280	I guess.
3239280	3240280	Wait, wait.
3240280	3246240	So you got a place, three, three doors down from Paramount, uh, four doors.
3246240	3250160	Did you foresee, did you foresee working on community like you first saw playing D&D?
3250160	3251840	No, it's all just bullshit, man.
3251840	3252840	It's crazy.
3252840	3256360	It's, you know, Jackson is a guy who I met through Dustin.
3256360	3257920	We all share similar birthdays.
3257920	3263080	So we met at like a joint birthday party we had, um, Jackson as a guy who comes to Hermitown
3263080	3264080	all the time.
3264080	3265080	Yeah.
3265080	3266080	And so he's a cool guy.
3266080	3269480	And so we got to talking and we went to an arcade and played some video games.
3269480	3271600	I mean, you know, talking stuff, nerd stuff.
3271600	3273480	This is why the moon colony is going to work.
3273480	3274480	Yeah.
3274480	3279480	It's society is going to be, it's instead of elections, you just have shamanic, uh,
3279480	3280480	coincidences.
3280480	3281480	Yeah.
3281480	3282480	That's all it's been.
3282480	3285760	And then he just, uh, one time he was like, Hey man, you should come room here.
3285760	3286760	It's really cheap.
3286760	3291200	And it was the first time I'd like seen any place I can move out to that was, uh, within
3291200	3292200	my money.
3292200	3296160	I had just gotten the job at Apple not too long ago, increasing my income, but you know,
3296160	3299660	still finding an affordable place was eluding me.
3299660	3302480	And I've watched a lot of documentaries about cults and things.
3302480	3307660	And I see where everyone gets tripped up, like, like, like cults that work.
3307660	3313200	They all start with an awesome guy like me, uh, saying, Hey, it's cool, man.
3313200	3314880	I'm not awesome.
3314880	3317240	And uh, and then everyone's like, yeah, but you are.
3317240	3320920	And I'm like, all right, if you insist.
3320920	3324320	And then you go and get a place like on the moon or in Maui or something.
3324320	3330800	And uh, the, the downfall is always, uh, when the old fat guy at the top that, that started
3330800	3336960	all starts, it starts to go, yeah, you know, and it's like, Hey, you know, if you're 16
3336960	3344840	and you're a girl, you know, like, Hey, you find a rose in your pillow.
3345840	3351240	That means it's time for you and I to play a monopoly.
3351240	3353160	Are you going to, are you going to fuck Spencer?
3353160	3354160	What's going on here?
3354160	3355560	Where is this going?
3355560	3360480	I'm making my promise to our moon colony that I will not fuck your daughters or, or, or
3360480	3361480	you.
3361480	3366840	I am in love with Aaron and I will, I will, I will stick to the, you know, I, I, I, that,
3366840	3371360	because it seems like that's the, that's the shoelace that trips every cult leader up.
3371360	3374360	When they, when they, when they, when they, when they go, like, they just can't avoid
3374360	3375360	the temptation.
3375360	3379880	They go like, Oh man, I could really parlay this into smashing some posts.
3379880	3381600	And it's just like, it's not worth it.
3381600	3382600	You know?
3382600	3384360	It's a, it just fucks everything up.
3384360	3385360	What was that?
3385360	3386800	Hey, Aaron, what was the name of that documentary?
3386800	3388760	Who's that guy?
3388760	3389760	The source family.
3389760	3390760	Please.
3390760	3391760	Everyone watch.
3391760	3392760	I'm not.
3392760	3395760	I'm just, it's like laughing.
3396760	3397760	Hey.
3397760	3399760	Hey, are we interesting?
3399760	3402760	Oh, what?
3402760	3404760	Aaron, just get out here.
3404760	3407760	Aaron McGathey, everybody.
3414760	3418760	But no, please watch this documentary called the source family.
3418760	3419760	It's amazing.
3419760	3423760	I, I recommended the WikiLeaks thing and I want to stress, I got, I got a couple of
3423760	3427760	tweets from WikiLeaks impassioned people.
3427760	3434760	I, I, I did not mean to imply that the documentary WikiLeaks, we steal secrets is somehow like
3434760	3436040	the full story.
3436040	3443800	I got, I got like all these tweets that were like, you know, from people that I think are
3443800	3448320	probably on the right side of justice and stuff who are like, yeah, that documentary
3448320	3449320	is bullshit.
3449320	3453320	Well, obviously if a third party makes a documentary about something that you're that, you know,
3453320	3459040	like into the, and it's two hours long, you're going to think it should have been six hours
3459040	3461880	long and should have included this and that and that and that and that.
3461880	3467880	This is a two hour documentary that like tries to objectively or like, like, like concisely
3467880	3471560	kind of like, like explain this like fascinating story.
3471560	3475840	I never said, oh man, this is the final word on whether you should respect anything.
3475840	3477080	I think systems suck.
3477080	3480080	I think Julian Assange seems like an awesome fucking guy.
3480080	3485760	I don't, I don't know what it looked like, how fair that documentary is in terms of how
3485760	3489600	many details it had to cut out in order to be two hours long.
3489600	3494440	But anyways, I, when I recommend something, it's because it's, it's, it's like, it's interesting
3494440	3496040	to watch it for two hours.
3496040	3497880	So two, two more recommendations.
3497880	3499720	Watch the source family documentary.
3499720	3502800	It'll blow your fucking mind.
3502800	3505040	It's about this cult that I've never heard of before.
3505040	3510520	It's amazing study in the, in the evolution of a cult, which is not necessarily an evil
3510520	3511520	thing.
3511520	3513280	Like, it's just like cults are neither good nor bad.
3513280	3516440	They're just this phenomenon that spring up and happen.
3516440	3521720	And, and then also we went and saw this is the end tonight at the Arklight, a very funny
3521720	3522720	comedy movie.
3522720	3527320	Everyone's like, I can get behind a big mainstream successful comedy, but I was delighted by
3527320	3528320	it.
3528320	3529320	Go see it.
3529320	3530320	Seth Rogen's back, everybody.
3530320	3531320	Thank heavens.
3532080	3535200	I felt like I was 10 years old watching Ghostbusters again.
3535200	3537440	It was like, it was really, really funny.
3537440	3542480	If anyone goes and sees this is the end and thinks that it's not worth your ticket price,
3542480	3547800	I will, I will debate you online because I've seen a lot of shitty movies.
3547800	3548800	I'm 40 years old.
3548800	3550040	I'm really jaded.
3550040	3555040	The last thing I'm going to enjoy is a movie about a bunch of famous Yahoo's playing themselves
3555040	3556560	in a screwball comedy.
3556560	3559480	Like I, I, I, I thought it was delightful.
3559480	3560480	All right.
3560480	3562560	Spencer, what's your thoughts on that?
3562560	3563560	Go toe to toe with your dad.
3563560	3564560	Yeah.
3564560	3565560	Father's day.
3565560	3566560	Father's day fight.
3566560	3567560	Let's clear the air.
3567560	3568560	Let's clear the air.
3568560	3569560	Okay.
3569560	3570560	First of all, tell him you love him.
3570560	3571560	I love you.
3571560	3572560	All right.
3572560	3582800	Standing on top of a stage, Spencer is awkwardly
3582800	3591840	goaded into showing affection for his paternal relatives.
3591840	3606440	And then I, I, Spencer, you got balls as big as your heart, that's the show, right?
3606440	3608880	And vice versa.
3608880	3614920	That's my tombstone.
3614920	3617640	I assume your, your dad should play Kumail's character.
3617640	3618640	Kumail can.
3618640	3619640	Oh yeah.
3619640	3620640	That'd be awesome.
3620640	3621640	Yeah.
3621640	3622640	Kumail Najani can't make it tonight.
3622640	3623680	Has your dad ever played D&D with you?
3623680	3626040	Not to my knowledge.
3626040	3628320	So this is a very special Father's day episode.
3628320	3629320	It really is.
3629320	3630320	I did it.
3630320	3632160	I really, I have a great podcast.
3632160	3642600	And it's just, I don't even work at it.
3642600	3644800	It's just my voice, you know?
3644800	3650560	If you were to fire me, Jeff, I think we would, the critics would go, something's missing.
3650560	3651560	Something's missing.
3651560	3652560	I think something's missing.
3652560	3655560	What the fuck do you think is missing?
3655560	3656560	Unbelievable.
3656560	3657560	The outrage.
3658560	3663800	I had so much retroactive outrage, I can't talk about it.
3663800	3665040	It's too uncharismatic.
3665040	3669280	I just have to sit on my totally justified outrage.
3669280	3673640	What are the arguments I looked at online where I was like, well, I think season three
3673640	3678640	was so shitty that season four, it seems like, are you fucking kidding me?
3678640	3682320	Fuck mother, fuck you in the fucking motherfuck.
3682320	3683320	Fuck you.
3683320	3685920	Fuck your mother with your father.
3685920	3686920	Fuck you.
3687920	3688920	Fuck you, man.
3692920	3698920	People hate me that much that they're that willing to debate the possibility that I wasn't,
3698920	3699920	fuck you.
3700920	3702920	Like, wow, I must be really unlikable.
3702920	3703920	Jesus.
3703920	3709440	I'd like to say, I think the key to the success of the podcast, because my wife and I have
3709440	3713920	discussed this, is really that your heart is as big as Spencer's balls.
3717920	3718920	All right.
3719920	3721920	I just got the key to the city.
3721920	3728920	And also, I can say with almost certain lack of fear of contradiction that we have a title
3728920	3730920	for our next episode.
3731920	3734920	Is it your heart is as big as Spencer's balls?
3735920	3737920	Balls is as big as Spencer's heart?
3737920	3738920	I don't know.
3738920	3744920	This is redundant, but you should know that everyone in the booth was crying when you
3744920	3745920	were talking about your dad.
3745920	3747920	When I say everyone, I mean Dustin Marshall, our producer.
3747920	3748920	We had to cry like this.
3750920	3755920	I mean, the father-son stuff is not a fake thing.
3756920	3763920	Like, when you watch Lion King, when you read Hamlet, father-son stuff just gets you, because
3763920	3765920	there is a power there.
3767920	3772920	It's almost unfair, because the reason the power is there is precisely because there's
3772920	3778920	not an actual visceral connection on the level of the actual people that are carrying
3778920	3786920	the child, squeezing it out at their own peril, and if that child should be female, the bond
3786920	3796920	between us of the dangling wee-wee, when you have a little wee-wee and you use your little
3796920	3799920	wee-wee to make another thing with a little wee-wee.
3800920	3803920	Please let us of the dangling wee-wee be your cult name.
3807920	3815920	Because there is absolutely nothing, that wee-wee, that male symbol, the universal symbol
3815920	3819920	for male and female, the male one is like this circle with an arrow coming out of it.
3819920	3825920	I think that's so potent, because it's like men are just this cursed half of the species
3825920	3832920	that have a life expectancy of, what, 20 years less, and we lose our hair as we get older
3832920	3836920	because we're riddled with this disease called testosterone.
3836920	3845920	We don't actively create with our bodies, which life in the beginning before the development
3845920	3852920	of sexual reproduction, all cells were these asexuals reproducing cells.
3853920	3861920	If all life was in the same soup, life meant creating new life.
3861920	3869920	It meant that you were never more than one unit of life away from a thing that was actually you
3869920	3870920	in some real way.
3873920	3878920	When plants were developing and trying to figure out how they could develop faster,
3878920	3884920	sexual reproduction started happening, which carried into biological, what do you call it,
3884920	3887920	whatever, it was more advanced than plants.
3888920	3895920	Men, drones, these things that create sperm, and we just shoot it wherever we can shoot it.
3895920	3902920	We kind of walk the earth and we're disconnected from God.
3903920	3905920	We fetishize that.
3905920	3908920	We have a big murder complex about it.
3908920	3913920	We build skyscrapers and missiles and just hate yourselves and each other.
3915920	3920920	I'm going to make a bigger hole in the world before I leave than you, and I'm going to fuck
3920920	3924920	more pussy than you, because there's nothing.
3925920	3927920	I'm not saying feel sorry for men.
3928920	3931920	It's amazing how we...
3935920	3937920	I don't know, I lost it.
3937920	3938920	Cum is amazing.
3939920	3940920	Happy Father's Day.
3941920	3943920	May your balls be because it gives you a hug.
3943920	3945920	The moralist Dan loves cum, you guys.
3945920	3946920	Just take that away.
3947920	3948920	You can't throw any of it out.
3948920	3950920	I love cum, Spencer's dad.
3952920	3954920	Your son's coming to work for me on Monday.
3954920	3955920	It's going to be great.
3956920	3958920	It's like you've Neverland Ranch.
3960920	3962920	Alternate title, I love cum.
3965920	3966920	Erin, you called your dad, right?
3967920	3968920	I did.
3968920	3969920	I called my dad.
3969920	3971920	My dad actually left Father's Day.
3971920	3976920	My dad calls me when it's Father's Day or his birthday in the morning and leaves a voicemail.
3976920	3980920	He left me a voicemail about Dan speaking about that father-son connection.
3980920	3984920	My dad's so excited about you, he wants you to be his son, so he called me asking me about
3984920	3985920	you.
3985920	3990920	But yeah, my dad has an adorable habit of hanging up on me, which isn't...
3990920	3992920	It's not cold.
3992920	3995920	It's like, hey, hey, Erin, how's it going?
3995920	3997920	Oh, it's going great.
3997920	3999920	You know, Dan and I are hanging out.
3999920	4000920	We're about to get dinner.
4000920	4001920	Oh, good, good, good.
4001920	4002920	My day was good.
4002920	4008920	I grilled and I hung out with a wife and I took a nap and it was a real great day.
4008920	4010920	And then, click.
4010920	4011920	They're just like, hang up.
4011920	4012920	And they're like, yeah, I met him.
4012920	4013920	Hello?
4013920	4014920	He thinks it's a walkie talk.
4014920	4015920	Maybe because he was in the Navy.
4015920	4017920	He thinks it's like he's just talking to the bridge.
4017920	4020920	No, but then you say, out.
4020920	4022920	Well, it is a...
4022920	4023920	May I play...
4023920	4024920	Chaplain out.
4024920	4026920	May I play his Father's Day voicemail real quick?
4026920	4027920	Yeah.
4027920	4028920	It's 10 seconds.
4028920	4029920	It's about you.
4029920	4030920	Yeah, very able to.
4030920	4031920	You can't be my phone.
4031920	4032920	Sorry.
4032920	4033920	You know what a tight ship we run here.
4033920	4034920	I hope this is nice and tidy.
4034920	4035920	So anyways, yeah, sperm.
4035920	4038920	All right, here we go.
4039920	4041920	And my dad's also a great...
4041920	4043920	He's a great guy.
4043920	4046920	He's a little selfish, but he's great.
4047920	4048920	He's a pastor, right?
4048920	4049920	He's a pastor.
4049920	4051920	He's a minister of God.
4051920	4053920	Yeah, he's a minister of God.
4053920	4057920	We were drinking a whole lot yesterday as we had to because we were watching a shitty
4057920	4059920	TV show all day.
4061920	4063920	What season was it?
4064920	4067920	Season fan fiction.
4067920	4068920	Heart.
4068920	4069920	No heart.
4069920	4071920	I'm so sorry.
4071920	4072920	Remember what he said?
4072920	4075920	Greenblatt said we're bringing the heart back?
4075920	4077920	I mean, I'm not allowed to express it.
4077920	4078920	I can't do it.
4078920	4079920	That's not fair.
4079920	4080920	Fuck you.
4080920	4083920	So we were drinking a lot.
4083920	4084920	What heart?
4084920	4086920	Where was the heart?
4086920	4088920	Oh, the heart.
4088920	4089920	My heart.
4089920	4090920	My heart is the heart.
4090920	4094920	What about Britney and Troy's really intimate love affair?
4096920	4097920	The move...
4097920	4099920	Did you guys see the fountain scene?
4099920	4101920	Oh, my heart.
4101920	4102920	Love.
4102920	4103920	Love has never been...
4103920	4106920	The heart was the size of regular baby's balls.
4108920	4111920	The heart in that show was as...
4111920	4114920	The heart in that show was as moving as balls.
4114920	4116920	It's a picture of balls.
4116920	4117920	I apologize.
4117920	4118920	Whatever.
4118920	4119920	No one cares what I think about community.
4119920	4120920	No stakes.
4120920	4121920	No one's going to fire me from anything.
4121920	4122920	You're not going to fire me.
4122920	4125920	You're only going to promote me if I'm in front of a...
4126920	4127920	She's right.
4128920	4132920	Oh, but we were drinking, and I got real emotional thinking.
4132920	4133920	No.
4134920	4137920	We were drinking, and we were talking about fathers,
4137920	4140920	and I've done this many times before.
4140920	4143920	I've compared my father to Dan because he's a pastor,
4143920	4146920	and he has people who...
4146920	4149920	He has a flock, you know.
4149920	4150920	It's a whole thing.
4150920	4155920	But he's also really obsessed with himself and his...
4155920	4157920	You're not a flock.
4157920	4158920	You guys.
4158920	4159920	Don't worry about that.
4159920	4160920	It's other people.
4161920	4163920	Cut you a guy in the back that's dressed like a sheep
4163920	4165920	that hangs his head and walks out.
4165920	4166920	All right.
4167920	4169920	This is my dad's voicemail.
4171920	4172920	Wait, where's the speaker?
4172920	4173920	On the bottom.
4173920	4174920	Jesus Christ.
4177920	4179920	I know I'm in trouble when Jeff Davis is telling me
4179920	4180920	a technical thing.
4180920	4181920	All right, here we go.
4181920	4182920	Hey, Erin.
4182920	4183920	This is Dan.
4183920	4184920	Colin, say hi.
4184920	4185920	Wait.
4185920	4186920	I'm sorry.
4190920	4192920	So, Dan, what are you guys doing later?
4194920	4195920	It's fine.
4196920	4199920	Just wanted to let you know your boyfriend
4199920	4202920	is a fat, alcoholic piece of shit,
4202920	4205920	and he's going to live to 48 the way he eats.
4205920	4207920	It's a reference to the Chevy Chase voicemail.
4207920	4208920	All right, here we go.
4208920	4209920	Here we go.
4209920	4210920	Sorry.
4210920	4211920	Sorry, Andy.
4212920	4213920	Hi, Erin.
4213920	4214920	This is Dan.
4214920	4215920	Just thought I'd give you a call.
4215920	4219920	I heard that Dan got the community back again,
4219920	4222920	so I just wanted to talk to you and get an update
4222920	4224920	and see how y'all are doing.
4224920	4225920	Love you.
4225920	4226920	I'll talk to you later.
4226920	4227920	Bye-bye.
4228920	4231920	I mean, that's his father's day voicemail.
4232920	4234920	Wait, that's just a voicemail.
4234920	4235920	No, I know.
4235920	4236920	It's just a voicemail, but he said it.
4236920	4237920	Aren't you supposed to be the one calling him
4237920	4238920	for Father's Day?
4238920	4239920	I know, right?
4239920	4240920	Yes.
4240920	4241920	Yes.
4241920	4242920	But you're a dad.
4242920	4243920	You have to say that.
4243920	4245920	By the way, you guys haven't talked about it.
4245920	4249920	For the podcast listeners, Spencer's dad looks like,
4249920	4251920	if there was a superhero called Dad,
4251920	4254920	you look like the daddest dad ever.
4254920	4256920	No one's looked more like that.
4256920	4258920	Yeah, like the dad from Family Guy.
4258920	4262920	Regular son of someone was working in the nuclear facility
4262920	4270920	when an unprecedented bolt of dad energies turned him into...
4270920	4273920	You have a kind face, sensible glasses,
4273920	4275920	a button-up shirt.
4275920	4276920	That's really nice.
4276920	4277920	Do you like to garden?
4277920	4280920	As a friend of mine said about a kind face,
4280920	4282920	the kind of face that you'd like to shat on.
4282920	4283920	Oh.
4284920	4285920	That's just one variation.
4285920	4287920	Yes, I do like to garden, actually,
4287920	4289920	although I'm getting too old for it now.
4289920	4291920	Vegetables, flowers?
4291920	4296920	Well, we had a backyard which was a two-to-one ratio hill,
4296920	4302920	and I spent like two years of my life making that into a kind of a sunset garden,
4302920	4306920	and since then it's gone to seed and everything, but it was fun.
4306920	4307920	Right.
4307920	4309920	See, and then at this point his foes,
4309920	4311920	which are the people who can't have children,
4311920	4314920	are shrinking and dying as he's explaining both.
4314920	4316920	That was a weird reaction.
4316920	4318920	I was saying that he was a superhero.
4319920	4321920	That's a weird bit.
4322920	4323920	Aaron, Aaron, I'm sorry.
4323920	4324920	Can we hear that message again?
4324920	4326920	Because that was fascinating.
4328920	4330920	I feel like I missed some of the nuance in that one.
4330920	4334920	I feel like maybe we could revisit that message.
4334920	4337920	I mean, maybe what we should do is listen to all of his voicemails
4337920	4339920	and we kind of piece it together.
4339920	4342920	It's meaningful to me because my dad,
4342920	4345920	now my dad just talks to me about Dan.
4345920	4346920	He doesn't talk.
4346920	4350920	Which is fine, but I was thinking about the father-son connection.
4350920	4352920	It's true that Father's Day, I'm like,
4352920	4354920	the golf clubs, I don't care.
4354920	4356920	I love my dad, but it's different.
4356920	4359920	There's not the same thing.
4359920	4364920	And then Mother's Day is, I guess Mother's Day would be more meaningful.
4364920	4366920	Well, Mother's Day came first,
4366920	4368920	and Father's Day, because I looked it up,
4368920	4371920	because I was talking to our friend Lars from Denmark,
4371920	4376920	and Father's Day, there's different dates in different countries.
4376920	4378920	If you go to the Wikipedia page,
4378920	4381920	it's like a big, long, complicated list of dates.
4381920	4384920	But it was an American invention.
4384920	4387920	It was then just adopted, I think, throughout the globe,
4387920	4390920	but on different days, because they probably,
4390920	4393920	I'm assuming that in Denmark, if we say,
4393920	4395920	it has to be the third Sunday of every June,
4395920	4398920	they're like, well, that's Vamenschlingen.
4398920	4399920	Vamenschlingen.
4400920	4401920	Can't do it there.
4401920	4403920	You know what I do have as the recording of you
4403920	4405920	leaving a voicemail for Bill Murray.
4405920	4406920	That doesn't matter.
4406920	4408920	It's as unremarkable.
4408920	4410920	I said, hello, Bill Murray.
4410920	4411920	It's Dan Harmon.
4411920	4412920	Give me a call.
4412920	4415920	Three, two, three.
4415920	4418920	All right, five, five, five.
4418920	4421920	All right, so we should probably get to Dungeons and Dragons.
4421920	4422920	All right.
4422920	4424920	Spencer.
4424920	4427920	If you would pass out the character piece to Dan,
4427920	4429920	and he'll pass us along.
4429920	4430920	Yeah.
4430920	4432920	Let's get this shit underway.
4432920	4438920	Last time on Harbontown D and D.
4438920	4440920	Our heroes had just slain their shadows
4440920	4444920	in a combat most deadly on the shadowy Shadow Plane of Shadows,
4444920	4447920	a slaying which also returned the adventurers
4447920	4450920	to the Material Plane in the burnt-down ruins
4450920	4452920	of the Connie Forest.
4452920	4455920	Just then, a brilliant emerald energy was released
4455920	4459920	as the soul of growth began soul of growing the Connie Forest
4459920	4461920	back to its former glory.
4461920	4464920	At the same time, Quark's talking dagger exploded
4464920	4467920	and the ensuing magical energy cloaked itself in branches
4467920	4469920	and roots and began speaking,
4469920	4472920	claiming it was the soul of growth.
4472920	4474920	The entity greeted the travelers
4474920	4477920	and thanked them for unwittingly releasing the trapped spirit.
4477920	4480920	After arguing with the newly materialized force of nature,
4480920	4483920	the gang picked a new name for the Avatar of Seasons
4483920	4485920	to avoid confusion,
4485920	4489920	dubbing him Rudy Woodgrowth III.
4489920	4491920	Jesus Christ, man, your dad's here.
4491920	4493920	Yeah, I know.
4493920	4497920	The nature spirit gave the heroes crazy awesome nature powers
4497920	4502920	before ushering them through a tree and outside of Yellow Camp,
4502920	4504920	Sharpie's father's home.
4504920	4509920	But would it be, as they expected, a Father's Day reunion?
4509920	4513920	Or would it instead be a demon-infested nightmare?
4513920	4516920	We'll find out next.
4521920	4523920	God damn it.
4525920	4527920	This is going to be the best Father's Day ever.
4527920	4530920	Now who should clean their room?
4533920	4536920	Thanks, Adam, for the note that you left on my character sheet.
4536920	4540920	Maybe Liberty Spikes, because that's cool and feminine.
4544920	4546920	I forgot to mention that.
4546920	4549920	He put your character's hair into Liberty Spikes.
4549920	4550920	What?
4550920	4551920	That happened.
4551920	4552920	Well, fine.
4552920	4554920	That's how it works.
4554920	4556920	I'll just do whatever.
4556920	4560920	That's what Adam Goldberg says at the foot of every woman's bed
4560920	4564920	at 5 a.m. as he refastens his belt.
4564920	4567920	I gave you Liberty Spikes.
4567920	4570920	Welcome to the wonderful world.
4570920	4573920	And she doesn't question it because she just wants him to leave.
4573920	4575920	So she's like, yeah, all right.
4575920	4577920	You'll find out what they are later.
4577920	4580920	Adam's note at the bottom of my page is,
4580920	4581920	Suppie, I owned it.
4581920	4583920	Kisses Adam.
4586920	4590920	So if you recall, you got seasoned powers,
4590920	4592920	but you didn't know how to use them.
4593920	4595920	So Rudy Woodgrove III was like,
4595920	4598920	Oh, I'll teach you your powers.
4598920	4601920	Well, I read here that I have the armlet of winter
4601920	4604920	that I can use to call up a sleet storm twice a day,
4604920	4605920	10-foot radius.
4605920	4607920	Enemies might fall down.
4607920	4608920	Yeah.
4608920	4610920	So, yeah.
4610920	4612920	They might fall down.
4612920	4614920	It's shorthand.
4614920	4616920	Also a Final Fantasy I reference.
4616920	4618920	But, yeah.
4618920	4621920	I can calm or intensify hail, sleet, and snow.
4621920	4623920	Yeah. I love it.
4623920	4626920	I mean, there's no peace of mind like having that thing
4626920	4629920	because even before you use it twice a day,
4629920	4631920	you could just say to the enemy
4631920	4634920	the way you rack a pump-action shotgun,
4634920	4638920	You might fall down.
4638920	4641920	And a lot of times that's more powerful
4641920	4643920	than actually having to use it.
4643920	4644920	Absolutely.
4644920	4645920	Or them actually falling down.
4645920	4646920	It's probable that you'll be clumsy.
4646920	4647920	Sorry.
4647920	4649920	I've got a 10 skill modifier on intimidate.
4649920	4651920	I bet I could combine those together.
4651920	4652920	Yeah.
4652920	4653920	See, he's like a pro.
4653920	4656920	You know, Jeff's been playing a lot of D&D behind the scenes.
4656920	4658920	Yeah. I'm figuring this shit out finally.
4658920	4660920	My armlet is the armlet of spring.
4660920	4665920	It can summon armor of thorny vines twice a day.
4665920	4668920	You can command the vines to stop protecting you
4668920	4670920	and lash out to entangle a foe.
4670920	4672920	After they stop entangling, they come back.
4672920	4673920	That sounds pretty cool.
4673920	4674920	Yeah.
4674920	4678920	And I can calm and slash intensify clouds.
4679920	4681920	No, guys. Wait for it. Wait for it.
4681920	4683920	I promise they're intensifying.
4683920	4685920	Just stare at them.
4685920	4687920	Clouds, comma, showers.
4687920	4691920	Are you saying that you've looked at clouds from both sides now?
4691920	4694920	I don't know.
4694920	4695920	All right.
4695920	4698920	So the way I remember it is we went back to my dad's camp
4698920	4702920	and what was in place there was like Admiral Darkstar
4702920	4705920	had taken it over and some weird shit was going on.
4705920	4708920	We slinked back out into a field
4708920	4711920	to see if we could learn to use our armlets.
4711920	4714920	We became the Four Seasons.
4714920	4715920	Yeah.
4715920	4718920	And there was the music that played.
4718920	4719920	That was good.
4719920	4723920	So now we're in this field with Rudy Woodworth.
4723920	4726920	Rudy Woodgrowth III.
4726920	4727920	You named him.
4727920	4730920	And some armlets that might make people fall down.
4730920	4731920	All right.
4731920	4734920	I say we...
4734920	4736920	I go back in towards like an exam
4736920	4739920	and the foes that we were facing before.
4739920	4740920	Okay.
4740920	4743920	So you kind of crawl under this yellow canvas
4743920	4745920	and you're inside the interior.
4745920	4748920	It's open-topped so the sunlight is kind of shining down,
4748920	4752920	but you're situated between two kind of empty cages
4752920	4754920	peering between the cages, you can see.
4754920	4757920	Kind of hordes of people that look like they're in rags
4757920	4760920	kind of tied to a large turbine kind of system.
4760920	4762920	So there's not a turbine, whatever.
4762920	4764920	They're spinning, they're like moving it around like cattle
4764920	4766920	kind of being whipped by demons.
4766920	4770920	So the main foes you see are these three gaunt demons
4770920	4772920	with these scraggly kind of tentacle-like beards.
4772920	4774920	And they're whipping these people
4774920	4776920	and they seem kind of prominent.
4776920	4779920	And occasionally you see kind of lurking guards
4779920	4782920	of these slimy slug guys that look kind of like
4782920	4785920	half human monstrosities and half slugs.
4785920	4789920	Flesh colored, sliding around on the ground in patrols.
4789920	4790920	All right.
4790920	4792920	Sharpie, we're here to meet your dad.
4792920	4794920	Is your dad gone or is he here?
4794920	4796920	Well, I mean, this is where he was.
4796920	4797920	He's not around anymore.
4797920	4799920	I mean, it's Father's Day, Sharpie.
4799920	4801920	Well, yeah, but I mean, you can't expect everything
4801920	4803920	to sync up perfectly.
4803920	4806920	I don't know. Did you hear that intro?
4806920	4808920	I know, well...
4808920	4811920	Maybe I could use blood magic to locate my father
4811920	4812920	like I did that one time.
4812920	4813920	Yeah.
4813920	4815920	Blood magic under special abilities
4815920	4817920	because I forced it with bad improv.
4818920	4819920	Yep.
4820920	4821920	It works in this world.
4821920	4823920	What do they do?
4823920	4827920	You cut yourself and you meditate it on the ensuing blood.
4829920	4830920	Cut.
4834920	4837920	The cosmic sounds of milk whippings.
4839920	4842920	The blood, it drops to the floor and sinks into the ground,
4842920	4845920	but it kind of, after sinking into the ground,
4845920	4847920	it kind of comes back out and beads up
4847920	4849920	and forms a kind of arrow that leads like kind of
4849920	4851920	into the center of this area.
4852920	4853920	Nice.
4853920	4854920	Thank you.
4854920	4855920	Happy Father's Day.
4858920	4860920	I told you, the father's own bond.
4860920	4861920	It's bigger than any system.
4861920	4863920	I go on with these guys.
4863920	4864920	I explain.
4864920	4866920	Okay, so I...
4866920	4867920	It happens.
4867920	4872920	I start crawling like slow and low to the ground
4872920	4874920	along the direction of that arrow
4874920	4876920	and I look back and I...
4877920	4879920	I give them that kind of Vietnam hand signal
4879920	4882920	where you put a hand up and you wave them for it
4882920	4884920	and I point out to the foes and I say,
4884920	4886920	we got three slug monsters.
4887920	4889920	We got slug monsters in the wire.
4890920	4891920	Okay, that happens.
4891920	4892920	All right.
4892920	4893920	I start approaching.
4893920	4895920	But are we inside or outside this tent?
4895920	4897920	So if Quark actually came through,
4897920	4900920	I'm assuming you guys did too, but maybe you didn't.
4900920	4901920	As long as it felt safe.
4901920	4902920	Yeah.
4902920	4903920	I went through.
4903920	4904920	There we go.
4904920	4905920	So are these foes...
4905920	4906920	You said these foes are past foes.
4906920	4908920	Like, we don't need to...
4908920	4909920	I don't remember saying that.
4909920	4910920	No, we saw them, never fought them.
4910920	4911920	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4911920	4912920	Oh, yeah, because you were gone.
4912920	4914920	So you came into this tent, right?
4914920	4915920	Sorry, sorry.
4915920	4916920	It's fine.
4916920	4917920	I didn't even...
4917920	4918920	It's fine.
4918920	4919920	It's Father's Day.
4919920	4921920	You're a daughter, maybe one day a mother.
4921920	4922920	It's not...
4922920	4923920	You're out of place.
4925920	4926920	No, so you went...
4926920	4929920	You went into this tent and you saw all these demons
4929920	4931920	and then you left and now you're coming back.
4931920	4933920	I'm distracted by how sorry the audience felt for me
4933920	4934920	in that moment.
4934920	4935920	I don't understand.
4936920	4937920	Anyway, sorry.
4937920	4938920	Okay, got it.
4938920	4939920	I'm not explaining it twice.
4939920	4940920	No, I know.
4941920	4943920	Oh, he just hung up on you fucking Father's Day.
4943920	4944920	This guy's got a heart pulse.
4944920	4945920	Yeah.
4946920	4947920	Sorry.
4947920	4948920	Okay.
4948920	4949920	What's happening?
4949920	4950920	Probably demons.
4951920	4952920	All right.
4952920	4954920	How close am I to the nearest foe, the nearest judge?
4954920	4958920	So you're pretty close to like a small slithering patrol
4958920	4959920	of these slug dudes.
4959920	4963920	You're pretty far away from the nearest, the big beardy demon.
4963920	4966920	Those guys are kind of in the very center of the camp
4966920	4968920	and you're still pretty much on the periphery.
4968920	4969920	All right.
4969920	4971920	All right, don't get mad when I ask you this.
4972920	4973920	Where are we?
4973920	4975920	You're in Yellow Camp.
4975920	4977920	We're in the Yellow Camp inside the tent.
4977920	4978920	Okay, except it's changed.
4978920	4981920	Spencer's dad, how do you feel right now watching,
4981920	4983920	being on stage with your son?
4983920	4984920	Oh, it's awesome.
4984920	4987920	Especially like when he does that little smile,
4988920	4992920	little kind of impish smile after he just dissed you,
4992920	4994920	but then he smiles to let you know he's just kidding.
4999920	5001920	Now he's giving you a frown.
5001920	5003920	I can confidently say I don't think I've ever been happier than I am.
5003920	5007920	Spencer gives daggers to his dad through his eyes.
5007920	5009920	For revealing my game.
5010920	5016920	He says, Dad, get the hell off of stage and stop embarrassing my bearded ass.
5016920	5017920	I couldn't.
5023920	5024920	Not on Father's Day.
5024920	5026920	I couldn't do it on Father's Day.
5027920	5028920	Any other day.
5028920	5030920	So I have a plan of attack.
5030920	5031920	Can I go?
5031920	5032920	Yeah, yeah.
5032920	5034920	Okay, well, I'm putting on the armlet of autumn,
5034920	5036920	which can make me invisible.
5036920	5037920	Uh-huh.
5037920	5041920	And I'm going straight for the big ass demon in the middle
5041920	5046920	and I'm going to use my poison dagger to try and put him away.
5046920	5048920	Use that poison dagger.
5048920	5051920	Now, can I ask, would that be a sneak attack?
5052920	5055920	Well, yeah, since I'm invisible, I guess it would have to be.
5055920	5056920	Yeah.
5059920	5062920	There has never been a better podcast ever.
5062920	5063920	Dad.
5064920	5066920	Dungeon Dad Snap.
5066920	5067920	Dad.
5070920	5071920	There's a plate in the back.
5071920	5074920	Let's all drink it and just die and put it down.
5074920	5076920	Well, let me ask you this, son.
5076920	5079920	Was it a sneak attack when I drove you to McDonald's to meet your friends
5079920	5082920	and you made me drop you off two blocks away?
5088920	5089920	I've never done that, right?
5089920	5091920	Why couldn't you be invisible, Dad?
5091920	5096920	Son, your words are like a poison dagger sometimes.
5096920	5099920	You don't realize how bad they can wound.
5099920	5103920	You just dealt six hit points to my pride.
5103920	5105920	What is your father-son bonding activity?
5105920	5108920	Like, do you have something that you guys enjoy doing together?
5108920	5111920	Like, fishing or...
5111920	5113920	I know you guys don't play D&D together.
5113920	5115920	Like, historically.
5115920	5116920	They just watch Gossip Girl.
5116920	5119920	Well, I mean, is there a show that you guys watch together?
5119920	5120920	No.
5121920	5125920	Sometimes I might, when he was home and he was watching Adventure Time,
5125920	5128920	I might sit down with him and enjoy Jake and Finn.
5128920	5129920	He didn't really like it very much.
5129920	5130920	Spencer, your dad loves you.
5130920	5131920	Let him in.
5134920	5135920	No.
5138920	5139920	No dice.
5139920	5141920	This is a source of pain.
5141920	5143920	I don't know why all of you are laughing.
5146920	5147920	Because it's not us.
5148920	5149920	Oh, my gosh.
5151920	5154920	What I wouldn't give for a dad, it would come to a show that I did.
5155920	5159920	My dad asked me routinely, how is your internet talk going?
5161920	5163920	Yeah, but you don't want him listening.
5163920	5165920	No, I certainly don't, no.
5166920	5167920	Yeah, exactly.
5167920	5171920	Well, maybe you guys should, you know, model trains,
5171920	5173920	or, like, there's got to be something.
5173920	5176920	You guys ever go out in the backyard and fire up the grill?
5177920	5182920	I built him a dice tower once for D&D.
5182920	5184920	We built it together.
5184920	5186920	Oh, well, that's a thing.
5186920	5188920	That's not something we do.
5188920	5190920	That's one thing we did.
5191920	5194920	Let me in, let me in, son.
5194920	5197920	My heart is like a cold dungeon.
5201920	5202920	I don't know.
5202920	5204920	Talk it out the only way you know, Spencer.
5205920	5209920	Examining my personal feelings as well as past events.
5211920	5215920	Andy, are you and Spencer's mom experiencing any sort of empty nest syndrome?
5216920	5218920	She is, she is.
5218920	5219920	Yeah.
5219920	5220920	But she follows...
5220920	5222920	Is she making you wear a beard?
5223920	5226920	No, she'd like for me to grow my mustache back, but...
5227920	5230920	I got too many pom-chicka-pom-poms.
5231920	5233920	So, I just won't do that anymore.
5233920	5236920	I keep seeing glimmers of your sexuality.
5237920	5239920	It's horrifying, I know.
5240920	5244920	And glimmers of Spencer's dad's sexuality is the name of my book.
5245920	5251920	My dad one night agreed to build a robot with me.
5252920	5258920	And for the rest of my life, there was this half-built robot in the basement.
5259920	5260920	Metaphor?
5260920	5263920	And you're like, dad, can we finish this metaphor, please?
5264920	5265920	Stop building this.
5265920	5269920	And he's like, the fact that it will never be finished is the complete metaphor.
5272920	5276920	Alright, so Andy, as Chris DeBerg has just sneak attacked invisibly into the yellow camp.
5276920	5278920	Yeah, that happened.
5279920	5286920	Anyway, so yeah, you creep in, unseen, up on this demon dude, you know, straight up.
5286920	5290920	And you roll your attack, which I already rolled like five minutes ago.
5291920	5294920	And you strike as you do.
5295920	5297920	As you've done so many times.
5298920	5302920	Why am I here? Please let me out. Please release me.
5303920	5304920	Dealing.
5308920	5310920	Twenty-four damage.
5311920	5312920	Holy shit.
5313920	5315920	He really is Spencer's dad.
5317920	5320920	Unfortunately, demons are immune to poison.
5322920	5324920	Well, give him that. Give him that.
5324920	5329920	Yeah, so that happens. Spencer, before this is over, I want you both to roll a hug check.
5330920	5333920	Save versus bonding.
5335920	5339920	I mean, my dream would be for Spencer and Andy to switch places and...
5340920	5343920	For his dad to Dungeon Master?
5343920	5344920	That wouldn't work.
5347920	5349920	I don't get it.
5350920	5352920	This is so fascinating.
5353920	5355920	I really have never been happier.
5356920	5359920	I love your dad more than I love anyone in my family.
5361920	5368920	I, through my armlet of summer, I have acquired fiery arrows.
5369920	5371920	Yeah, that's true.
5372920	5380920	I fire a single, good, fiery arrow at the enemy.
5382920	5385920	She has a plus seven on adjectives for her arrows.
5386920	5394920	I should remind you, if you read yourselves in the trappings of your fiery armor that grants your arrows flamingness,
5395920	5397920	that would give away your position.
5397920	5399920	Either way, I mean, you could still do it, but I should warn you.
5400920	5403920	Well, I have a sack and some...
5405920	5407920	Now, is that sack made of asbestos?
5408920	5410920	Thank you. Thank you, Jerky Bill.
5412920	5414920	How about Cool Rock Bill these days?
5415920	5416920	It's Rock Bill?
5416920	5417920	Cool Rock Bill.
5417920	5419920	Are you referring to his satiny shirt?
5419920	5421920	I'm just trying to go with New Bill.
5422920	5424920	I think it's Open Mic Jazz Night, Bill.
5425920	5427920	He gave cool rocks to people, you guys.
5427920	5429920	Do you not remember this?
5429920	5430920	Yes, yes.
5430920	5432920	Bill's biggest advocate.
5432920	5433920	Me too.
5433920	5434920	Yeah, Bill.
5434920	5436920	He brought rocks to your birthday?
5437920	5439920	He gave rocks to people in the audience today.
5439920	5441920	Bill didn't give me rocks.
5441920	5442920	Yeah.
5444920	5446920	It's this whole thing.
5446920	5450920	Beef Jerky Bill is going to just spit some more rocks while this game happens, everybody.
5452920	5459920	If you podcast listeners hear a strange jingle-jangle of stones slapping together gently.
5460920	5462920	Like ripples to a stream.
5463920	5467920	Beef Jerky Bill is wearing what can only be described as Neil Diamond's last tour shirt.
5469920	5474920	It's kind of a dark brown coppery satin affair with some nice cufflinks.
5474920	5475920	I really like that, Bill.
5475920	5478920	It's definitely like an 8,000 thread count shirt.
5479920	5480920	I like this.
5480920	5484920	He's sifting to the crowd with a giant Ziploc baggie full of stones.
5484920	5488920	I don't want to encourage too big of a tangent, but what's the deal with the stones?
5488920	5489920	What's the story?
5490920	5491920	It's this whole thing.
5492920	5496920	Normally a guy in Hollywood on a satin shirt walking around with a slinging rock is a whole different thing.
5497920	5506920	I really wish there was someone here to rival a stone beef jerky Bill named, like, Sand Andrew, who just started handing out...
5506920	5509920	Wouldn't it be amazing if Beef Jerky Bill's dad was here?
5511920	5514920	And he just had a bag of, I don't know, model trains.
5515920	5521920	Can we make next week just an arbitrary specific gift night where everybody brings the crowd?
5522920	5524920	It's just like a big show and tell.
5524920	5525920	Do you have a pageant of gifts?
5525920	5528920	Yeah, we'll do a little show and tell and everybody has to bring treats.
5528920	5531920	We'll do an episode where the theme is derailment.
5533920	5536920	So that the show is not derailed.
5537920	5539920	So I, okay, so I don't want to...
5539920	5540920	Thank you, Bill.
5540920	5541920	I don't want to give away my position.
5541920	5549920	So with my sack and my bedroll...
5550920	5552920	Both flammable.
5554920	5558920	You're going to launch an attack on demons with a sack and a sleeping bag?
5558920	5562920	I'm going to be clear that I'm not doing a bit, and this is how I like to play.
5562920	5563920	Damn it, we play a private...
5563920	5564920	You're going to get us killed out here.
5565920	5567920	We play a private D&D game.
5568920	5573920	We play a private D&D game, and we were trying to get 50 pounds of copper out of a mine,
5573920	5577920	and Erin pipes in and goes, and she plays an older gentleman who's a bard,
5577920	5581920	and she put forth the concept of taking the cheese that she has and melting it
5581920	5584920	so we could slide the copper out of the mine.
5587920	5588920	It's not that crazy.
5588920	5591920	She was greasing the bottom of the sack.
5591920	5593920	How much cheese did she carry?
5593920	5596920	I had to explain carrying capacity to everyone, and then we were like,
5596920	5598920	oh, everyone can carry all the copper.
5598920	5599920	It's fine.
5599920	5601920	But I still wanted to slide my copper.
5601920	5604920	Anyway, after that night, Dan had a very serious talk with me,
5604920	5607920	which was, do you care about this game?
5607920	5609920	Are you taking it seriously?
5609920	5611920	This is how I...
5614920	5622920	You're making it sound like I was yelled at you
5622920	5625920	after everyone left for the cheese melting cheese.
5625920	5631920	And then he hit me with his bag of holder.
5631920	5633920	It's the fact that 90% of the time...
5633920	5636920	You put a beard on when everyone's coming over.
5636920	5638920	You put snacks out.
5638920	5639920	You do everything.
5639920	5641920	You host this party.
5641920	5642920	Everyone comes over and plays D&D.
5642920	5644920	But then you also, throughout the night,
5644920	5647920	you're like, it seems like you're barely focused on the game
5647920	5649920	and that you're not enjoying it.
5649920	5651920	And I was saying to you that night,
5651920	5655920	because I was saying, it seems like you're not enjoying it.
5655920	5659920	I think if you sit in a chair and focus on the game,
5659920	5661920	it's like, oh, that's that.
5661920	5664920	And you were like, I just wanted to melt cheese.
5664920	5667920	I was like, I'm not yelling to you about that fucking cheese thing.
5667920	5670920	I love what a sassy neighborhood kid I am.
5672920	5675920	I think I have, in the same way that you say that you have Asperger's,
5675920	5678920	I have adult ADHD, and it's a serious thing.
5680920	5683920	I'm just wondering if sliding your copper
5683920	5686920	is some kind of sexual euphemism.
5686920	5689920	I'm not going to sleep with you, Spencer's dad.
5691920	5693920	I have a boyfriend and you have a wife.
5694920	5696920	It would get so complicated.
5697920	5702920	Does ADHD stand for always Dan Harmon defying?
5702920	5704920	Devoted.
5706920	5710920	Well, Dan is right, I could be more focused during D&D.
5712920	5716920	You're not paying attention a hell of a lot during that game.
5716920	5719920	That's a syndrome where if you don't pay enough attention during D&D,
5719920	5721920	then it's hard.
5721920	5724920	Then you come sit down and it's like,
5724920	5727920	you need to get immersed in the game, baby.
5727920	5729920	She did it for you.
5729920	5731920	Shut up, lady.
5732920	5736920	Yes, she puts out a plate of baby carrots.
5736920	5738920	She sharpens pencils.
5739920	5743920	I'm no stranger to the sacrifices she's making,
5743920	5748920	but I would give all that up for her to have a good time.
5748920	5751920	I want her to enjoy herself during the game.
5751920	5755920	I would rather just go to the Roosevelt Hotel and rent a bungalow.
5755920	5757920	Let's go to the fucking Chateau Marmont
5757920	5760920	and do a big bag of Coke and play Dungeons & Dragons.
5760920	5763920	Have people bring shit to us.
5763920	5765920	Let me die that way.
5765920	5771920	Let there be black and white autopsy photos of you with a die in my fist.
5771920	5773920	After that conversation,
5773920	5777920	I realized that I was being distracting to other people because I was distracted.
5777920	5779920	But I wasn't unhappy.
5779920	5782920	Especially me, though, because I'm your boyfriend.
5782920	5784920	I don't think anyone else cares that much.
5784920	5786920	I don't know.
5786920	5790920	It does come off to me that you don't really enjoy playing the actual game.
5790920	5794920	The game is not something that you particularly are invested in.
5794920	5798920	I do have a good time.
5798920	5804920	I get distracted by hosting, which I really enjoy.
5804920	5807920	I really like putting out snacks.
5807920	5809920	The snacks are out.
5809920	5811920	No, I know.
5811920	5814920	You don't have this chip in your brain
5814920	5817920	that gives you joy when you're taking care of people.
5817920	5819920	I get distracted by that.
5819920	5821920	I get distracted by people being hungry.
5821920	5824920	I also get distracted by being drunk and being like,
5824920	5826920	I've got an idea.
5826920	5828920	What if a puppy was a therapist?
5828920	5830920	I should think about this wrong.
5830920	5834920	That's an actual note in my phone that I saw tonight that I was writing during D&D.
5834920	5838920	I was like, yeah, a puppy should be a therapist.
5838920	5843920	Meanwhile, we're getting our asses slashed to pieces by hobgoblins and shit.
5843920	5846920	Well, to be fair, in the first couple of games,
5846920	5852920	when I was really invested and I suggested things that I was taking very seriously,
5852920	5857920	you shut me down, and I felt, no, please don't do that.
5857920	5859920	That makes me want to kill myself.
5859920	5861920	How did I shut you down?
5861920	5864920	No, I'm fine.
5864920	5869920	When we were talking, this is getting very specific, and Pittsburgh-y,
5869920	5876920	but when we were talking about this, it's not a big deal,
5876920	5880920	but when we were giving our personal bios over our characters,
5880920	5883920	and I know what you're going to say after I say this, but I was-
5883920	5886920	I want to hear that too.
5886920	5892920	I was giving the bio of my character, Mordecai Stumpgarden,
5892920	5895920	who I was really excited to play,
5895920	5898920	in the middle of me explaining my origin story,
5898920	5903920	in which I said, because I wanted to have a connection with you in this story,
5903920	5907920	I said, well, and I think that, you know, because we're both-
5907920	5909920	This is getting real deep.
5909920	5910920	We're both halflings.
5910920	5913920	We're both halflings in the thing, so I suggested-
5913920	5921920	I said, well, and my character and Jeff's character,
5921920	5925920	we both have- we have a secret connection,
5925920	5927920	and then I continued to explain my story,
5927920	5930920	and in the middle of it, Jeff was like, are you done?
5930920	5931920	Is that it?
5931920	5932920	And I was like-
5932920	5934920	That's not what happens.
5934920	5936920	That's absolutely not what happens.
5936920	5940920	Well, it was something adjacent to all your- are you done?
5940920	5942920	You know what I'm talking about, though.
5942920	5944920	Yeah, you said, we have a secret connection.
5944920	5946920	We have a mysterious passagener.
5946920	5949920	I was like, I didn't know what my character was.
5949920	5950920	We just picked our character.
5950920	5952920	I didn't know who I was.
5952920	5954920	I was like, what?
5954920	5956920	I have no idea what you're talking about.
5956920	5957920	I just threw it out there.
5957920	5959920	I didn't know what it was going to be either.
5959920	5962920	I was unable to, yes and that, because I didn't know what my fucking character was.
5962920	5965920	And then you told me to stop explaining my character.
5965920	5966920	And then I told you to go fuck yourself,
5966920	5969920	and then I kicked you in the dick and took your wallet.
5969920	5970920	Oh, God, I'm sorry.
5970920	5972920	I was a terrible person then.
5972920	5974920	No, you're not a terrible person.
5974920	5976920	I'm sorry if you felt shut off by that.
5976920	5977920	That was not my intention.
5977920	5978920	It's really not a big deal.
5978920	5981920	You were offering some thing, and I didn't know how to further that.
5981920	5983920	I didn't know what was going on.
5987920	5989920	This is a reference to a Dungeons & Dragons game,
5989920	5992920	to which you guys are not invited.
5992920	5995920	Meanwhile, it's so much more interesting now.
5995920	6000920	I mean, you have been totally delightful during Dungeons & Dragons.
6000920	6002920	I feel, I mean, it's more about me.
6002920	6006920	I think maybe I'm an idiot, but my ideas are,
6007920	6010920	I want to make contraptions out of the things that I have on my list,
6010920	6012920	and I want to put cheese on bags.
6012920	6014920	And maybe it's stupid.
6014920	6016920	And in the middle of my description,
6016920	6020920	it made note to me that it was silly and a little too out there.
6020920	6026920	And I think, I mean, I'm the lowest common denominator, so...
6026920	6027920	To what?
6027920	6029920	To...
6029920	6032920	Well, I have a really good time during Dungeons & Dragons.
6032920	6033920	Well, I don't think that's fair.
6033920	6036920	First of all, if you want your role to be,
6036920	6038920	if what you delight in is saying,
6038920	6041920	okay, I have a sack in my inventory and I have an eagle in my inventory,
6041920	6043920	I want to put the sack over the eagle
6043920	6046920	and turn it into an eagle sack and use that to think.
6046920	6050920	People around you have a right to look at you with their mouth open.
6050920	6051920	No, totally. They do.
6051920	6054920	That's part of our enjoyment of it.
6054920	6056920	If you look around the room,
6056920	6058920	no one's going to be looking at you with their hand on their chin going,
6058920	6060920	like, go on.
6060920	6062920	It's like working with Nikola Tesla.
6062920	6065920	No, I don't care about that. I really don't care about that.
6065920	6069920	The thing that makes me kind of shut up a little bit is that
6069920	6075920	my worst nightmare is that it feels like I'm saying those things
6075920	6079920	during our D&D game because I am like,
6079920	6081920	well, fuck it, I'll just do whatever.
6081920	6086920	But really, I'm putting all of my little brain cells into one little packet.
6086920	6088920	Yeah, but you're frequently...
6088920	6090920	It's not all the time.
6090920	6092920	There's been times when you're so up and down,
6092920	6094920	you're in the kitchen, you're there,
6094920	6096920	and we're going around and we're being a combat thing,
6096920	6098920	and everyone kind of has to be aware of who's where
6098920	6100920	and who's holding what and what's going on,
6100920	6103920	and then it comes back to you and it'll be a reset
6103920	6105920	because somebody's not in the room like that.
6105920	6107920	Even if I get up for a second to go make a drink,
6107920	6109920	you come back in, you've missed stuff.
6109920	6111920	No, you're totally right. I'm sorry.
6111920	6113920	I'm in the conversation that I had.
6113920	6115920	You keep dropping your goddamn character sheets all over the place.
6115920	6117920	I just love feeling like a queen. Pick it up, Spencer's dad.
6117920	6119920	I'm a queen. Thank you.
6120920	6122920	All right. Come on.
6122920	6124920	All right, so you fire an arrow at the demon.
6124920	6126920	She shoots a fucking arrow.
6126920	6127920	Everyone dies.
6127920	6129920	Oh, shit.
6129920	6131920	Happy Father's Day to me.
6131920	6133920	No, wait. What were you going to do with the sack?
6133920	6135920	You brought the sack out for a reason, right?
6135920	6137920	Oh.
6137920	6139920	Well, okay.
6139920	6142920	So I want to take the sack out on the petrol out
6142920	6145920	because I want to make a Maureen dummy.
6145920	6154920	So you're saying this sack is as big as Spencer's sack.
6154920	6158920	I'm not going to sleep with you, Spencer's.
6158920	6161920	No matter how many times you pick up those character sheets,
6161920	6164920	it's not going to happen.
6164920	6167920	You're right. I am very distracted during your game,
6167920	6170920	and I'll try to be less distracted.
6170920	6172920	So I am going to...
6172920	6174920	We just want you to have fun.
6174920	6177920	We want everyone there to be enjoying the game itself.
6177920	6180920	I think the audience wants to be enjoying the game itself.
6180920	6182920	We're in love with it.
6182920	6183920	Fair enough.
6183920	6185920	Look, they got rocks.
6187920	6188920	Yeah.
6188920	6190920	Yeah, usually when they come here and put their $10 down,
6190920	6191920	what do they get?
6191920	6194920	Jonah Ray talking about eating pussy. I don't know.
6194920	6195920	Tonight they got a rock.
6195920	6196920	That's not very huge.
6196920	6197920	They saw you cry.
6197920	6198920	Yeah.
6198920	6200920	Yeah, I cried about my dad. You got a rock.
6200920	6202920	Fuck you guys.
6202920	6203920	All right. Let's...
6203920	6205920	Okay, okay. So let's do it really quick.
6205920	6207920	I talk shit about community.
6207920	6211920	Let's at least earn one experience point in this fucking campaign.
6211920	6214920	You said that if I shot my fire arrow,
6214920	6216920	I would give away my position.
6216920	6217920	So this is my plan.
6217920	6220920	I would like to put my bedroll inside my sack.
6225920	6227920	I'm not going to sleep with you, Erin.
6228920	6231920	I put my bedroll in my sack,
6231920	6234920	and I put it in the corner of the room.
6234920	6237920	What is the shape of the room? Is it an octagon?
6237920	6239920	It's like a pentagon.
6239920	6240920	Okay, cool.
6240920	6241920	Yeah.
6241920	6244920	So I put it in one corner of this pentagon shape,
6244920	6246920	and I would like to...
6246920	6249920	And I also... I take some of my hair,
6249920	6251920	and I put it...
6251920	6252920	How? How do you do that?
6252920	6254920	I pull it out of my head because I'm a fucking badass,
6254920	6256920	and I don't give a shit.
6256920	6258920	These liberty spikes. Adam...
6258920	6261920	You cut your hair. You have your hair. You're welcome.
6261920	6263920	Oh, boy.
6263920	6265920	All right, so I...
6265920	6268920	Adam, we are Goldberg-ing ourselves tonight.
6268920	6270920	This is self-Goldbergian.
6270920	6272920	You're alive and well on the stage.
6272920	6274920	This is a self-Goldberg show, pre-Goldberg.
6274920	6277920	It's like acid wash jeans. We don't need to...
6277920	6279920	I happen to have, as everyone knows,
6279920	6283920	I have a scarf around my waist that is the same color as my hair.
6283920	6287920	And I take it off, and I throw it on top of this...
6287920	6291920	This bed sack inside... This... This bedroll inside the sack.
6291920	6295920	I... And everyone knows that I'm fast as light.
6295920	6300920	I fire my arrow, and I run away.
6300920	6303920	Like I fire it in front of my dummy.
6305920	6308920	And then I run to another corner,
6308920	6312920	and I'm able to... I shape myself into, like, a slug.
6313920	6316920	Shape. And I...
6316920	6319920	Let me see your character sheet. That's not on there.
6319920	6321920	That's not on there.
6321920	6323920	But as, like, a... like a... a...
6323920	6325920	Humanic... Humanic...
6325920	6328920	As a humanoid creature, I can, like, just shape my body.
6328920	6330920	I say, I go for it.
6330920	6333920	I'm a slug, and I kind of spit up on my chin, and I'm like,
6333920	6335920	What's happening?
6335920	6336920	You realize...
6336920	6339920	You're going to get us all killed again.
6340920	6343920	I don't know. They might feel sorry for us.
6345920	6348920	At least melt the cheese so we can eat.
6348920	6352920	They might just put money at our feet and leave.
6356920	6358920	So, what do I roll?
6358920	6360920	I roll!
6360920	6362920	Let's keep it... Let's keep it going.
6362920	6363920	Okay.
6363920	6365920	Alright, so she does all that.
6366920	6370920	There's an Eric Clapton playing while we watch her do all that.
6370920	6371920	Okay.
6373920	6378920	It's in the way that you stuff a pillow into a bed,
6378920	6381920	roll and put a wig on it,
6381920	6385920	and then curl up into a fetal position and spit on yourself.
6386920	6390920	To start, I rolled a five, a four, and a five.
6390920	6393920	So, let that frame the results.
6393920	6396920	Cobbling together a quick makeshift mannequin
6396920	6399920	in an attempt to disguise attention from yourself,
6399920	6403920	you swiftly put it into position before loosing an arrow from your bow.
6403920	6407920	After that, you run in an attempt to disguise yourself,
6407920	6409920	like a slug person.
6409920	6411920	A humanic slug.
6412920	6417920	Your arrow goes wide, plummeting to the ground as if it were dropped.
6417920	6421920	You take off down the hall, but not the hall.
6421920	6422920	You just take off down the whatever.
6422920	6424920	And you get to your destination,
6424920	6427920	where you can tort yourself into a slug.
6427920	6431920	You're right near, like a detachment of slugs moving by
6431920	6433920	as if you're trying to blend in with them.
6433920	6435920	I'm starting to realize this is not a good idea.
6435920	6438920	You're starting to realize that?
6439920	6441920	What is this being told back to you?
6441920	6443920	When you hear it back, it sounds weird, right?
6444920	6446920	Well, when you say it...
6446920	6453920	It wasn't that finely honed gem that you thought it was.
6453920	6456920	The judging master is Ricky Ricardo.
6456920	6459920	I don't want to blow anyone's mind,
6459920	6463920	but I'm starting to realize I don't think I'm very good at Dungeons & Dragons.
6463920	6467920	There's better tools for the ploys you're trying to pull.
6467920	6470920	It's not always a bag and a bedroll.
6470920	6473920	Sometimes there's like magical pigments,
6473920	6474920	magical pigments.
6474920	6476920	Or, yeah, major creation involved.
6476920	6477920	Who knows?
6477920	6479920	You know, that's some deep stuff.
6479920	6480920	So what happened?
6480920	6481920	Everyone believed it.
6481920	6482920	So the arrow missed.
6482920	6483920	I killed the enemy?
6483920	6485920	The makeshift mannequin falls apart.
6485920	6489920	Like, it topples to pieces because it's two things arranged near each other.
6489920	6490920	But you were saying, like,
6490920	6492920	logically it just has to be like a distraction.
6492920	6493920	Like, where is this coming from?
6493920	6497920	And this is a magical world where maybe a bedroll is shooting arrows.
6497920	6498920	Who knows?
6498920	6499920	Right?
6499920	6500920	Like, you'd be like,
6500920	6503920	oh, the bedroll people are here.
6503920	6507920	But if you roll low, that entails you do a poor job,
6507920	6511920	and your effect isn't as grand as you'd hoped.
6511920	6514920	So this is a sack placed atop a bedroll.
6514920	6517920	Erin, can we all get together one night and play D&D your way?
6517920	6518920	Yes!
6518920	6519920	Yes, we can!
6519920	6521920	I would love it.
6521920	6524920	As an experiment, could he play mole rain, and could I?
6524920	6527920	And we'll make cakes, and there'll be baby carrots,
6527920	6528920	and we'll all do this stuff,
6528920	6531920	but we also have to do peyote.
6531920	6534920	And there's no actual combat allowed.
6534920	6538920	You get punished if you just take out a sword and head, motherfucker.
6538920	6546920	Everything has to be played as if you're playing a 1995 DreamWorks interactive video game.
6546920	6550920	I used the rake to find the wallet!
6550920	6552920	I mean, really, that made my heart so full.
6552920	6553920	I hope you're not joking.
6553920	6554920	No, no, I'd love to.
6554920	6555920	I actually would.
6555920	6557920	So you did some great video games in the 90s.
6557920	6558920	All right, Spencer's dad.
6558920	6560920	Because it's Father's Day, and the show's getting,
6560920	6562920	we're getting toward that bewitching hour right now.
6562920	6566920	Why don't you fire one parting shot for fathers around the world?
6566920	6567920	All right.
6567920	6570920	Well, I'm going to fire two blinding bombs.
6570920	6571920	A load, if you will.
6571920	6575920	In proper father fashion, he's going to fire two blinding bombs
6575920	6577920	and blame one on the dog.
6577920	6584920	Yeah.
6585920	6588920	I mean, technically speaking, it's not your turn.
6588920	6592920	Spencer.
6592920	6594920	Spencer, roll for a hug right now.
6594920	6597920	Roll for a father hug.
6597920	6598920	Don't tell him what to do.
6598920	6602920	I'm going to roll for a hug, and let's see what it actually comes up with.
6602920	6605920	Is it you hugging your dad, or is your dad hugging you?
6605920	6607920	I resolve we'll determine that.
6607920	6608920	Okay.
6608920	6610920	Trust me.
6610920	6612920	That's a 15.
6612920	6614920	That's a hit.
6614920	6616920	That's a solid hit.
6616920	6618920	So who hugs whom?
6618920	6620920	Wrapping his arms around his phone.
6620920	6623920	You can't just narrate it.
6623920	6629920	I'm not going to really do it.
6629920	6630920	Finish it.
6630920	6631920	Finish it.
6631920	6632920	I don't know.
6632920	6633920	Oh, what?
6633920	6634920	Finish what?
6634920	6638920	At the end of Harmon Town, they sit staring in stunned silence,
6638920	6644920	hoping that father and son will interact.
6644920	6649920	Their hopes were for nothing.
6649920	6651920	Hey, that's me.
6651920	6654920	That's who I am.
6654920	6658920	Thank you for coming to Harmon Town, everybody.
6658920	6660920	We wouldn't want you any other way, Spencer.
6660920	6662920	We love you.
6662920	6665920	Let's hear it for Andy, Spencer's father.
6665920	6671920	Spencer, thank you.
6671920	6673920	Thank you, sir.
6673920	6682920	Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug��.
6682920	6685920	Thank you once again.
6685920	6687920	Thank you, Erin McGathey.
6687920	6691920	We have a special D&D date done, Erin McGathey style.
6692920	6702920	I think the takeaway is be a father to everyone around you and don't anticipate anything from them.
6702920	6706920	Your son will be whatever kind of son he wishes to be.
6706920	6710920	But if he's your son, you should be proud of him.
6710920	6712920	I thought I could rip it.
6712920	6715920	Ted Herman, everybody.
6715920	6720920	Ted Herman, everybody.
6720920	6722920	Happy Father's Day.
6722920	6725920	I love you, Dad.
6725920	6727920	I love you, Dad.
6727920	6736920	Ted Herman, Ted Herman, now we are young.
6736920	6739920	Ted, we'll do.
6739920	6741920	We'll do.
6741920	6743920	We'll be young.
6743920	6748920	We'll share things that we do.
