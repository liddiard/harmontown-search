0	25720	Welcome to Hollywood, California, the Nerd Milk Theater, and thank you for listening
25720	28360	to us out in the podcast universe.
28360	49800	Please put your hands together and open your hearts for the Mayor of Harmanstown, Dan Harman.
49800	54280	You guys are fab, or mod, or whatever that music was.
54280	57560	Jeff, it's an important night tonight.
57560	64280	Because I'm very excited, not because I'm in a good mood, I guess I am, but just narratively
64280	73000	and kind of a- It's a big night for stuttering.
73000	78080	Conceptually, you just pointed out in the green room before we took the stage that we
78080	82320	are standing at the precipice of a nexus here.
82320	87100	I really don't follow the politics, but we just did the math in the green room.
87100	92180	Even though right now, tonight, in this room, we have no idea who the next president will
92180	93740	be.
93740	99740	When this airs, we will know, so we have an opportunity to create multiple timelines.
99740	102900	My favorite thing.
102900	106860	We are living on a razor's edge right now.
106860	108700	We are a Schrodinger's Nation.
108700	114380	Either there's a guy that's still a president that we don't know anything about, or what
114380	120420	happened at all, or there'll be a new guy who seems like a douchebag.
120420	122700	Or a lovely guy if he's the president now.
122700	125660	If he's not the president, my hat is off to you, sir.
125660	127660	Well run campaign.
127660	129220	Please.
129220	133740	Get those jobs for people?
133740	134740	I don't watch the news.
134740	135740	I don't like politics.
135740	138580	Dan and I don't know the first thing about politics.
138580	141180	Just surrender your mind.
141180	143060	Don't even pontificate about it.
143060	144780	Let's just leap into it.
144780	146940	Let's do two different openings.
146940	155340	The same audience, same enthusiasm if you please, whatever, however you want, but bring
155340	156340	me ...
156340	157340	Does somebody have a coin?
157340	158340	A quarter?
158340	159340	Let's flip a coin.
159340	160340	All right.
160340	161660	Heads Obama, Tails, Romney?
161660	162660	Yes.
162660	163660	We'll do both.
163660	166820	Just to be fair, we're going to pick ... like at a debate.
166820	173020	They flip coins to see who goes first.
173020	179460	It's heads Obama won, so let's bring ... wait, wait, sorry.
179460	180460	That's fine.
180460	181460	That's fine that you're enthusiastic.
181460	182460	He may or may not have won.
182460	183460	He won ...
183460	184460	Yeah, I'm sorry.
184460	185460	We didn't mean to tell you ...
185460	189220	That's not how the electoral college works, you guys.
189220	190220	We're not die-bold.
190220	191220	We don't ...
191220	195180	Harbontown doesn't have the power that you think we wield.
195180	198260	We didn't invest in a bunch of voting machines, sir.
198260	201500	God, what if that was John King would be out of a job?
201500	202500	Holy shit.
202980	206940	No, but I was just saying, hold your applause for ... because do the whole opening, because
206940	209260	depending on who wins, we would come down on the right side.
209260	210260	Just bring me up.
210260	211260	Zach, bring my stuff.
211260	212260	You guys pretend that you haven't seen me yet.
212260	213260	All right.
213260	214260	Go back out there.
214260	215260	You're going to stay up here and make a drink.
215260	216260	Whatever.
216260	217260	Okay.
217260	218260	We'll start again.
218260	219260	All right.
219260	228260	Harbontown is now in session.
228260	240220	Put those Democratic hands together for the mayor of Harbontown, Ted Harmon.
240220	241220	We did it, motherfuckers.
241220	242220	We did it.
242220	243220	Four more years.
243220	244220	Four more years.
244220	245220	Four more years.
245220	246220	Four more years.
246220	247220	Fuck you.
247220	248220	I love abortions.
248220	261180	I mean, I don't love them, but if I want to love them, I love them.
261180	265580	Fuckin' ... No, I just got myself an honorary abortion last night.
265580	268980	I'm in such a good mood tonight, Jeff, because Obama won the election.
268980	269980	I'll tell you what, though.
269980	270980	It was a squeaker.
270980	271980	It was a squeaker.
271980	274820	It's fucking weird how every four years it's a squeaker.
274820	275820	I don't get it.
275820	279020	It's almost like there's some weird industrial military complex pretending like we have a
279020	280620	choice when we don't actually.
280620	285620	Wait, Dan, Dan, Dan, are you saying that voting for one of two people, it was an electoral
285620	289340	college, creates a myth of efficacy that your vote doesn't matter at all?
289340	290580	Jeff, that would be crazy.
290580	296260	Who would be incentivized to do that except to hire echelon of rich people that own everything?
296260	300580	Why would all of them who have everything in common do that to a bunch of poor people
300580	304420	who also have everything in common and outnumber the motherfuck out of them?
304420	305420	Why would they do that?
305420	306940	I can't, Dan, but what's in it for them?
306940	307940	Why would they lie to us?
307940	308940	I don't know.
308940	313740	I'm just, I just love it that Obama won!
313740	320580	It feels good because, and here's why it feels good, because that other guy was fucking creepy.
320580	327060	I can't believe in a field of Republican candidate choices, I mean, there were some weirdos in
327060	328060	there.
328060	329060	Down to Mormons now.
329060	333020	Next year there will be a guy with a snake for a necktie.
333020	334100	Next year?
334100	335780	Next every year, right?
335780	338420	Well, it will be because there's a black guy in the White House.
338420	339420	It'll be every year now.
339420	341060	They're going to change the rules in the Congress.
341060	345300	I remember right up until the very moment that Pennsylvania finally got their head out
345300	353140	of their ass and fucking just barely went for Obama, because boy, was that a swing state.
353140	356660	But I remember thinking, this guy Romney, it always seemed like a joke that he was in
356660	357660	a fight.
357660	358660	No, he was constantly a joke.
358660	363260	Here's some other names that you don't remember, Steve Forbes, uh, I don't know, just Pat
363260	364260	Rasmussen.
364260	368540	The name names, especially on the Republican side, I mean, there's a million on the Democrat
368540	376620	side too, but it's so weird, we will never thank God to hear the words John McCain again.
376620	381860	He revealed himself in the final stages to be so vile, and right at the end there, Romney
381860	383500	just went radio silent.
383500	387460	They just fucking turned into, that's what an alligator does, right?
387460	393220	It just turns into a pair of eyes above swamp level, just like, that's what a cat does
393220	398140	right before it pounces, like, I thought, I thought, Jeff, for a second that something
398140	404180	shady was about to happen, but it turns out we still live in a completely democratic nation.
404180	408540	You're talking about the big dispute in Indiana, the big voter fraud thing in Indiana.
408540	414660	Oh shit, that thing that happened where people, people thought that Obama's dick, uh, that
414660	420500	was a ballot, they counted his dick as a ballot, they kept punching it.
420500	430860	There were all, there, it turns out, 70 year old women who fought in World War II, dicks
430860	437700	can be ballots to them, because they're, back then, paper was made of hemp before pot was
437700	443940	illegal, so you, you were allowed to, back then, tattoo your presidential choice from
443940	452420	overseas onto a, uh, slave's dick, and send him to America, and it was an absentee ballot.
452420	453420	But this is Indiana.
453420	459300	This is all a bunch of bullshit, I mean, it doesn't, uh, the point is, like, 70% of Indiana
459300	465100	was, like, unaccounted for, and it was a sway, but anyways, Obama won, it was, it was great,
465100	466100	alright.
466700	467700	Or Seventeen.
467700	468700	Or did he?
468700	469700	Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
469700	470700	Bill Tommen!
470700	471700	Howlman Teller's back in session.
471700	472700	Put your fascist hands together for the killer of Howlman Teller.
472700	473700	Ten!
473700	473700	
497100	500100	Eh, I don't know.
500100	501100	Sorry.
501100	502100	How's everyone doing today?
502100	503100	Four years!
503100	504100	Four years!
504100	505100	Four years!
505100	507100	Let's hope this one isn't eight, yeah.
507100	508100	I don't know.
508100	509100	What the fuck?
509100	513100	You know, I'm going to surprisingly, I'm looking at the positive side of it, though.
513100	515100	This is very much to me, like when...
515100	516100	What are you talking about?
516100	517100	Oh, the fact that...
517100	520100	We have a new president, everybody, in the White House.
520100	522100	Mr. Metavius Romney.
522100	524100	I think it was just called...
524100	525100	Metavius...
525100	527100	We should probably stop colloquializing him.
527100	528100	He's the commander-in-chief.
528100	531100	He deserves more respect than that.
531100	532100	I support our troops.
532100	535100	I support the people that don't support them.
535100	538100	Real quick, how many people here voted for Mitt?
538100	539100	Wow, just the one.
539100	540100	See, it's weird.
540100	541100	It's weird.
541100	542100	Well, California's a blue state.
542100	543100	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
543100	545100	We barely, any of us voted at all.
545100	548100	It was fucking Pennsylvania and Indiana who did it, man.
548100	549100	Those motherfuckers.
549100	550100	God damn it.
550100	551100	Swing states.
552100	557100	I think, you know, I'm bummed out that I can't get an abortion anymore.
557100	558100	Obviously.
558100	559100	Look, we've all known.
559100	562100	I mean, this argument's been raging forever.
562100	566100	I mean, we've known that abortions have been that coin landing on its edge every election,
566100	567100	after every election.
567100	572100	But Dan, as somebody that was recently fired off of a television sitcom,
572100	576100	you're probably happy to have somebody in office whose main focus is to get you a job again, right?
576100	577100	Yes, yes.
577100	582100	No, I just have so much about money and the economy and the trickling down with the HMOs and the hedge funds.
582100	591100	I'm such a relief because the last thing you want to do in a giant nation full of people is help people.
591100	592100	I just find that repulsive.
592100	595100	And I don't see how you're going to make money that way.
595100	600100	And I don't see, you know, how obviously his dad was very poor.
600100	605100	Yeah, but how do you feel about the fact that he lost the popular vote by 400,000 votes and still won them?
605100	606100	You know what?
606100	607100	That system's a place for a reason.
607100	608100	The Electoral College is a mystery to me.
608100	610100	The Electoral College will never understand it.
610100	614100	Why does Montana get to decide who wins the election?
614100	619100	Because there's less people there than there are senators or something.
619100	620100	Nobody knows.
620100	621100	Here's two things that people don't know.
621100	625100	Nobody's really ever going to have a good grasp of daylight savings time or the Electoral College.
625100	627100	And in the last three days, we had them both.
627100	630100	But this is an underdog story.
630100	631100	This is important.
631100	635100	Like, I think it's good that we live in a nation now where Romney got elected.
635100	636100	Yeah, because you know why?
636100	638100	Because anything's possible.
638100	643100	Because he won, which is amazing, without a single woman voting for him.
643100	645100	And that's more than half the nation.
645100	646100	Yeah.
646100	647100	I mean, that just says how bad...
647100	649100	First of all, how much women love Romney.
649100	651100	Because you know, like, women are allowed...
651100	654100	You're picturing your mom with the rolling pin, and she's telling you, like,
654100	656100	well, what your father says is best.
656100	659100	But she gets to pull a curtain still.
659100	660100	They haven't revoked that yet.
660100	661100	Not yet.
661100	666100	She can actually secretly vote for Obama, and she didn't.
666100	669100	Also, women just don't turn out to vote.
669100	672100	Women don't care about the electoral process.
672100	676100	They love making their little pancakes with their rolling pins.
676100	678100	That's their vote.
678100	681100	They cast it every time they flip a flapjack.
681100	684100	I vote for more griddles.
684100	688100	I'm more disturbed that women are still using rolling pins on pancakes because...
688100	690100	Well, don't you make them flat that way?
690100	691100	No.
691100	694100	I need a wife.
694100	697100	Thank you, Mitt Romney, for your new Mormon...
697100	701100	No husband left behind program.
701100	704100	No pancake over an eighth of an inch program.
704100	707100	Thank God I can now have 95 wives.
707100	708100	All right.
708100	710100	So end our political segment for tonight.
710100	711100	Let's start...
711100	712100	Let's reset.
712100	714100	Everyone's got a bad taste in their mouth.
714100	716100	They feel like Mitt Romney won the election.
716100	719100	Can we just reset it and pretend elections don't matter and start harmontown?
719100	722100	I'm going to do it, but I'm going to play without...
722100	725100	I'm looking at a song off of Zach, our tech guy's iPod here.
725100	728100	I'm going to restart the show with a song I don't know.
728100	730100	All right. I'm just going to crouch. I won't even come up.
730100	731100	Okay.
739100	742100	Harmontown is again in session, everybody.
742100	754100	Please put your hands together for the guru of harmontown, Dan Arnold.
772100	774100	Hill rhymes with Hill.
774100	776100	Going to take the pill, little jagged pill.
776100	778100	Got a Alanis Morissette reference.
778100	781100	I got a 90s man. I got a 40 years old.
781100	783100	I got a bad back. Don't know what I'm told.
783100	786100	I got a motherfucker. I got a hand on my hand.
786100	788100	I got a motherfucker going to make some bread.
788100	790100	You don't do it like a flapjack.
790100	791100	Use a rolling pin.
791100	793100	Going to fuck your mother if she lets my dick in.
793100	794100	Going to put it in her butt.
794100	796100	Going to put it in her mouth.
796100	798100	East, west, north, south.
798100	800100	Dan Herman, everybody.
801100	804100	That's been Harmontown. Thank you so much for coming.
804100	805100	Is that too short?
805100	810100	No, no, that felt too written because the fucking beat broke down at the east, west, north, south.
810100	811100	That was too bad ass.
811100	813100	I was like, wait, no, no, wait. That was improv.
813100	814100	Yes.
814100	816100	No, I promise you.
816100	819100	There's photographs of me not making that up on the way out.
819100	821100	I know that seemed awesome.
821100	826100	Then he ruined it by over apologizing for how awesome it seemed.
826100	829100	Then he was, of course, out of breath from rapping.
829100	831100	There was that embarrassing moment.
831100	835100	Review of that audio will reveal that that was truly improvised.
835100	840100	The mustard to the ketchup to the ketchup to the mustard.
840100	842100	Mustard and ketchup makes it.
842100	843100	Oh, you dropped your drink.
843100	845100	Adam Goldberg, can you pour me another drink?
845100	848100	Welcome to Romney's America.
848100	849100	Nice to see you.
849100	851100	Yeah.
851100	858100	I decided to start putting him into use just now in this moment.
859100	861100	Did you put any ice in it?
861100	862100	No.
862100	864100	Yes.
864100	866100	Wow.
873100	876100	That's mostly ice water.
879100	881100	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
881100	889100	Mustard to the ketchup to the mustard.
889100	891100	It was bad ass when I ran that with custard.
891100	892100	Remember?
892100	894100	That was fucking bad ass.
894100	899100	Fucking condiment wrap.
899100	902100	I can smell my own armpits right now.
902100	903100	Is that you?
903100	904100	I thought it was Adam.
904100	907100	No, that's not an onion.
908100	912100	It smells like an anarcho-punk cartoon.
912100	916100	I took off my sweater and I was wafting through the whole...
916100	920100	When you stink up a comic book store, that's like making dirt dirty.
920100	924100	But this isn't your normal level of body odor.
924100	925100	This is souped up.
925100	927100	It's because fucking Romney won.
927100	928100	It's crazy.
928100	930100	All right, let's do the segment.
930100	933100	It's me complaining about things that I'm not allowed to complain about.
933100	934100	Thank you.
934100	935100	I'm excited about it now.
935100	936100	Maybe that'll make it bad.
936100	938100	Okay, I talked to my gardener.
938100	940100	I talked to him.
940100	942100	For those of you who are faithful listeners, you know,
942100	944100	one of my problems that I wasn't allowed to complain about
944100	946100	is that I felt like my gardener was up to no good.
946100	950100	My grass is turning brown and it seems like he doesn't give a shit.
950100	953100	The same gardener that the previous owners had for 35 years.
953100	954100	Well, I'm sure not for the...
954100	958100	He'd be like a weird Kubrick, like Space Baby.
958100	961100	But he was there for a long time.
961100	964100	I inherited him from...
964100	967100	That seems politically incorrect.
967100	972100	I indentured him his servitude.
972100	976100	I can't find the right words for the truth.
976100	978100	It's okay.
978100	979100	Romney won, man.
979100	980100	It's all good.
980100	981100	Oh, yeah, okay.
981100	983100	So I own this guy that...
983100	986100	I was like, yeah, you've been doing a great job.
986100	987100	Continue to do it.
987100	989100	The grass slowly started dying away.
989100	991100	I have a feeling, my theory is,
991100	993100	I think the old German lady that lived there before me,
993100	995100	I think she was out there every day.
995100	997100	I think she loved her.
997100	1000100	Clearly, I moved into a house that was cared for by its matriarch.
1000100	1001100	There were Edelweisses out there.
1001100	1003100	There's just flowers everywhere.
1003100	1004100	Everything's beautiful.
1004100	1005100	It was beautiful.
1005100	1007100	I moved in and it's dying.
1007100	1008100	And it's not just because I'm evil.
1008100	1012100	It doesn't work that way.
1012100	1014100	It's also because I don't water them.
1014100	1015100	You did call it Danadu.
1015100	1017100	Isn't that kind of curse?
1017100	1018100	That should be enough.
1018100	1019100	In my opinion.
1019100	1021100	It's just going to end up as you in a fireplace,
1021100	1023100	in a chair and a complete blackness.
1023100	1026100	But slowly, the grass is returning from green to brown.
1026100	1030100	Again, the heading of this is things I'm not allowed to complain about.
1030100	1033100	So it's fuck you for judging me while I complain about it.
1033100	1035100	What do you think the remedy for that is?
1035100	1037100	Well, I talked to the gardener.
1037100	1038100	And?
1038100	1042100	And I said, seems like the grass is brown now.
1042100	1045100	And he said,
1045100	1051100	and kind of nodded his head.
1051100	1056100	And I was like, is there anything we can do to make it green?
1056100	1063100	And he said, winter seed, winter seed.
1063100	1065100	There's things we could do.
1065100	1067100	I was like, I would like to do.
1067100	1068100	It was 95 degrees today.
1068100	1070100	It's not winter.
1070100	1072100	I would like to do those things that you're talking about.
1072100	1073100	He rattled off a bunch of things.
1073100	1078100	And it was like, I threw in, I'll pay anything.
1078100	1081100	And he said, I'll invoice you.
1081100	1083100	He's like a teamster with grass.
1083100	1084100	That's what it is.
1084100	1087100	He was ways leaning on me, waiting to see how much I cared.
1087100	1088100	That's it.
1088100	1090100	I think you're allowed to complain about that.
1090100	1098100	You're just not without sounding like a fucking dick to a nation of renters.
1098100	1102100	Next thing on my list.
1102100	1107100	My mail program on my computer won't let me turn it off.
1107100	1108100	Ooh.
1108100	1109100	All right.
1109100	1110100	What do you mean?
1110100	1112100	On your computer, it won't let you quit the application?
1112100	1117100	Every time I want to shut down the computer, it says, mail won't let you quit.
1117100	1121100	I used to be, I wouldn't call myself a hacker in days of old,
1121100	1123100	but I used to know how to make a fucking,
1123100	1129100	I won the Future Business Leaders of America competition in high school.
1129100	1131100	For computer applications in business,
1131100	1135100	I wrote a code for a Commodore 64 that would run an invoice program.
1135100	1138100	I was competing with guys that were writing in Pascal and Cobalt.
1138100	1141100	I won with my Commodore 64 basic program.
1141100	1143100	It was like 20 pages long.
1143100	1146100	I won second place.
1146100	1149100	But I was a code monkey.
1149100	1151100	I don't know what they call them.
1151100	1154100	I was a programmer.
1154100	1156100	I used to make these machines my bitch.
1156100	1158100	And I just, you turn into your grandpa.
1158100	1161100	I remember my grandpa before he died of emphysema.
1161100	1166100	I remember him fighting to the bitter end with his specs on his nose,
1166100	1170100	running his little Mac when they looked like those little beige machines
1170100	1171100	with a little smile face on them.
1171100	1174100	And he's like, how do I?
1174100	1180100	I just want to make a spreadsheet for the masons.
1180100	1183100	I'm up to 33rd level.
1183100	1184100	It's okay, grandpa.
1184100	1185100	It's beyond you.
1185100	1186100	It doesn't matter.
1186100	1187100	No, I won't.
1187100	1188100	I want to know.
1188100	1192100	I knew how to make a fucking truck out of sticks.
1192100	1196100	I fought the Nazis and won.
1196100	1201100	I deserve this and died because no one cares about his money.
1201100	1202100	Now I'm 40.
1202100	1204100	I can't make these fucking things work.
1204100	1205100	It's not a warning.
1205100	1206100	It's not a message.
1206100	1207100	It's a complaint.
1207100	1209100	It's not a complaint that you care about.
1209100	1210100	Fuck you.
1210100	1211100	It's just deeply, deeply sad.
1211100	1213100	It's getting very hard for me to run my computer.
1213100	1214100	You happy kids?
1214100	1216100	Is that what you wanted?
1216100	1218100	You want to shut me out?
1218100	1219100	Well, guess what?
1219100	1221100	Guess what you're shutting out?
1221100	1224100	The creator of Monster House.
1224100	1230100	You just lost everything I could have told you on Reddit.
1230100	1231100	All right.
1231100	1232100	Next thing.
1232100	1233100	I hate writing.
1233100	1234100	I hate writing.
1234100	1239100	I'm writing a bunch of things for a living and I hate writing.
1239100	1242100	I hate it.
1242100	1245100	Is that why you keep getting fired from jobs?
1245100	1246100	No, no, sir.
1246100	1247100	God damn it.
1247100	1248100	No.
1248100	1249100	Don't make that mistake.
1249100	1250100	I lose those.
1250100	1257100	I get fired because I love writing those shows when they get on the air.
1257100	1260100	The process is painful and it's terrible.
1260100	1265100	So your inertia, a writer at rest, it's hard to get that body in motion.
1265100	1267100	And once it's in motion, it's hard to stop the writer.
1267100	1270100	Here's a popular analogy that guys, writers use that women love.
1270100	1272100	It's like childbirth.
1272100	1275100	Yes, it's worth it.
1275100	1276100	Yes, it's wonderful.
1276100	1278100	Yes, it's a miracle.
1278100	1280100	Yes, therefore I like doing it.
1280100	1282100	No, I don't like doing it.
1282100	1283100	It's terrible.
1283100	1284100	It hurts.
1284100	1285100	It's the worst.
1285100	1290100	I would rather not have to do it, but I know that if I didn't have to do it, I'd be a shitty
1290100	1291100	person.
1291100	1293100	I don't want to have to do it.
1293100	1294100	I do want to have to do it.
1294100	1295100	I hate it.
1295100	1296100	Sucks.
1296100	1297100	Fuck you.
1297100	1299100	I hate writing.
1299100	1300100	Stupid.
1301100	1306100	I don't like these people who make these blogs that you run across, so they go like,
1306100	1309100	the joy of creativity.
1309100	1310100	I just like to talk.
1310100	1316100	I'm a mother of three and I have a tumbler and I like to talk to you about my writing
1316100	1317100	career.
1317100	1318100	I'm a published author.
1318100	1324100	I've had three poems about sesame seeds.
1324100	1328100	I shouldn't have made her a woman because you're a sexist.
1328100	1329100	Make it a guy.
1329100	1330100	Make it a guy.
1330100	1333100	But keep the sesame seeds.
1333100	1335100	I'm a published author.
1335100	1337100	I'm a published author.
1337100	1341100	I sent a thing in through an envelope and they published it in their quarterly farm
1341100	1342100	report.
1342100	1343100	Yeah, it doesn't matter.
1343100	1345100	This is how they're here, this person.
1345100	1347100	Here's my blog entries.
1347100	1352100	Ah, the forbidden stranger.
1352100	1362100	My forbidden stranger comes to me in moments that I don't understand.
1362100	1367100	Are you sure this is about writing?
1367100	1370100	Well, that you're not supposed to know until the end.
1370100	1373100	They're talking about writing, but they make it sound like they're having an affair.
1373100	1374100	Sounds like a rape fantasy.
1374100	1376100	Soccer practice is canceled.
1376100	1379100	The stranger's coming.
1379100	1381100	It comes without warning.
1381100	1384100	I wrestle with him in the mid afternoon.
1384100	1388100	My husband wishes I wouldn't do it so much, but I have to.
1388100	1391100	And it's like, you're talking about writing.
1391100	1393100	Hey, I'm reading your writing right now.
1393100	1394100	You're describing.
1394100	1396100	You suck.
1396100	1397100	You're a terrible writer.
1397100	1401100	Of course it's fun for you.
1401100	1402100	Yeah.
1402100	1404100	Oh, I am sorry.
1404100	1405100	Yes.
1405100	1415100	Writing is like, you are in a prison cell with God, and he has his way with you, and
1415100	1419100	you do what you can to stay alive.
1419100	1423100	You exchange whatever favors you have to exchange.
1423100	1425100	It is the reality.
1425100	1429100	How confident or unconfident are you that you, the next, because you have these two script
1429100	1430100	deals coming up.
1430100	1431100	They're both going to suck.
1431100	1432100	Everything's going to suck.
1432100	1434100	Honestly, do you think that you're going to like...
1434100	1435100	I got to eat a turd.
1435100	1436100	It's got to happen.
1436100	1437100	Because community was awesome.
1437100	1441100	How good are the next two things going to be?
1441100	1442100	That doesn't work.
1442100	1443100	That's how it works.
1443100	1446100	Are you just projecting that to be, you know, like...
1446100	1447100	Both, yes.
1447100	1451100	To pray to God that I can somehow squeak through, but also...
1451100	1454100	But you're not confident you're going to go hit these out of the park after what you've
1454100	1456100	learned from writing on that show for three years.
1456100	1457100	Yeah.
1457100	1458100	How can...
1458100	1459100	It just doesn't...
1459100	1460100	Look at anybody.
1460100	1463100	Somebody shout somebody's name out who went from hit to hit.
1463100	1465100	Or not hit to hit.
1465100	1467100	Awesome thing to awesome thing.
1467100	1468100	Like...
1468100	1469100	Charlie Kaufman.
1469100	1470100	Charlie Kaufman.
1470100	1471100	Daniel Day-Lewis.
1471100	1472100	Day...
1472100	1473100	No, I'm not...
1473100	1474100	I'm not laughing at you.
1474100	1475100	Yelling it out.
1475100	1477100	Babe Ruth.
1477100	1479100	Literally went from hit to hit.
1479100	1480100	Just writers.
1480100	1481100	Just writers.
1481100	1482100	Just writers.
1482100	1483100	Charlie Kaufman.
1483100	1484100	Larry David.
1484100	1485100	Larry David.
1485100	1486100	Yeah.
1486100	1487100	All right.
1487100	1488100	Fine.
1488100	1489100	Okay.
1489100	1491100	Far raised.
1491100	1497100	I'm Charlie Kaufman, Larry David, or the next two things are going to suck a horrible,
1497100	1499100	giant, turd-shaped dick.
1499100	1500100	Dick-shaped turd.
1500100	1502100	And edit it out.
1502100	1504100	And there's the title of our episode.
1504100	1505100	Now, edit it out.
1505100	1506100	Make it seem like a better writer.
1506100	1507100	Turd-shaped dick.
1507100	1508100	It stays in.
1508100	1512100	I remind you, this section is called Things I'm Not Allowed to Complain About Without
1512100	1513100	Making People Hate Me.
1513100	1517100	But it's not called the section where I'm not allowed to scrutinize.
1517100	1518100	No, no, no, no, no.
1518100	1519100	I didn't mean you.
1519100	1522100	I'm just telling them because they're getting a little bummed out.
1522100	1528100	But just sit through it.
1528100	1530100	Just a command.
1530100	1532100	It's not a bargain.
1532100	1534100	Tolerate it.
1534100	1536100	So Romney did win.
1536100	1538100	I have too many TVs.
1538100	1539100	Moving on.
1539100	1540100	Wait, yes.
1540100	1541100	Dan.
1541100	1542100	Yes, you do, by the way.
1542100	1543100	I have too many TVs.
1543100	1544100	I was up.
1544100	1545100	Dan has an upstairs thing.
1545100	1548100	Normally when you watch a movie at Dan's new place, you watch it downstairs.
1548100	1549100	There was a TV.
1549100	1550100	What was it, like a 50-inch?
1550100	1551100	It was pretty big, right?
1551100	1552100	60?
1552100	1553100	I don't know.
1553100	1554100	It was a big photo.
1554100	1555100	It was a big TV.
1555100	1556100	And you'd watch it down there.
1556100	1561100	And then I went over to watch Labyrinth again before our last episode to refresh ourselves
1561100	1564100	on a movie that Dan and I don't know are much alike.
1564100	1565100	And that's okay.
1565100	1566100	It's a good movie.
1566100	1568100	It's got problems.
1568100	1571100	But I was sitting downstairs eating Kit Kats.
1571100	1574100	The orange, the shitty orange Halloween Kit Kats.
1574100	1577100	They probably taste the same, but they don't fucking taste the same because they're orange
1577100	1578100	and it's gross.
1578100	1580100	I feel like they step on them a little bit.
1580100	1581100	Yeah.
1581100	1583100	To put it in wire terms.
1583100	1587180	Also, don't convince me that chocolate can be any color and taste as good as your shitty
1587180	1588180	brown chocolate.
1588180	1589940	It should be brown for a reason.
1589940	1594620	I feel like there's a stringer bell at the Reese's plant that's like, are we ready for
1594620	1595620	Halloween, man?
1595620	1596620	No, no.
1596620	1600180	There's more kids than usual this year and they're all dressed as shit and they all need
1600180	1601180	Reese's.
1601180	1602180	Step on it.
1603180	1605180	We can't step on a chocolate, man.
1605180	1606180	The whole thing is chocolate.
1606180	1608180	Put more orange chalk on it, motherfucker.
1608180	1610180	I don't have to tell you this shit.
1610180	1612180	It's the wire.
1612180	1613180	The wire.
1613180	1614180	Timely.
1614180	1615180	Most of you are nine.
1615180	1617180	So I'm downstairs waiting to watch this movie.
1617180	1619180	And then Aaron yells, Jeff, we're watching upstairs.
1619180	1623180	I didn't know that you had the upstairs movie arena all done.
1623180	1628180	And he's got this big room with a bigger TV screen, movie screen, whatever the fuck.
1629180	1633180	But there's another room next to it which is as large or larger and there's another giant
1633180	1634180	screen in that one.
1634180	1636180	Not as big as the one that we're going to go in with a big couch.
1636180	1639180	But there's a screen like a 60-inch screen.
1639180	1640180	80.
1640180	1641180	Uh-huh.
1641180	1642180	80.
1642180	1643180	80?
1643180	1644180	In the first room.
1644180	1645180	Oh, yeah, 60.
1645180	1646180	That's the bar room.
1646180	1647180	60.
1647180	1648180	A 60-inch screen.
1648180	1652180	I'm about to hang a hard right into a room with an 80-inch screen.
1652180	1654180	But before then, I'm bringing pizza in.
1654180	1657180	I'm putting pizzas down and there's a 60-inch screen.
1657180	1660180	And I'm looking at that screen and I turn around.
1660180	1664180	That screen is about, let's say, seven feet from my face.
1664180	1668180	And I turn around and there's a 40-inch screen three feet from my face.
1668180	1670180	Because I moved the couch.
1670180	1672180	So you have to be looking at something.
1672180	1675180	And then when I moved the couch, the 60-inch became obsolete.
1675180	1677180	It's just above a couch now.
1677180	1679180	So if you're sitting on that couch, there's just a TV behind your head.
1679180	1684180	I could put like trees or something and be like hanging out like, oh, it's like a future window.
1684180	1685180	It's like Logan's run.
1685180	1688180	A girl can appear on it and go, would you like to spend the night with me?
1688180	1690180	But it's not for actual viewing.
1690180	1692180	I just don't know what to do with it.
1692180	1694180	I'll sell it.
1694180	1695180	I don't know.
1695180	1696180	But I have too many TVs.
1696180	1697180	It's enough.
1697180	1698180	That's enough talking about it.
1698180	1699180	It's uncharismatic.
1699180	1700180	Too many TVs.
1700180	1703180	I do like that Dan's got this, there's a room.
1703180	1706180	When Dan first bought the house, I was up there with him.
1706180	1709180	And it used to be someone like the old, the patriarch of the house's office.
1709180	1714180	There was this giant cabinetry thing going on that took up like a lot of the room.
1714180	1717180	There was a doorway that was too small and a giant desk in there.
1717180	1720180	And I was like, maybe this is the movie room.
1720180	1722180	And I was like, yeah, but where would you sit?
1722180	1725180	He's got it all figured out in this big, beautiful sectional couch.
1725180	1728180	But there really is nowhere to set the drink.
1728180	1730180	It's the coffee table's coming.
1730180	1733180	But I thought something and you said it without me saying it.
1733180	1735180	We're going to move the couch away from the wall above three inches.
1735180	1737180	We're going to put a little bar rail behind it.
1737180	1738180	That's exactly what I was saying.
1738180	1743180	If you buy a home, kids, it becomes Joan Rivers' face.
1743180	1745180	It becomes like this, or Minecraft.
1745180	1752180	It just becomes like this constant, well, if I moved this wall back three pixels,
1752180	1755180	it'll be your new thing.
1755180	1757180	Or you're not a dick like me.
1757180	1763180	But I will say that you're not the most aesthetically minded person I've ever known.
1763180	1765180	But your house is coming together wonderfully.
1765180	1766180	It looks great.
1766180	1770180	Well, you bring up my next point, my final complaint, the ending tonight segment
1770180	1772180	called things I'm not allowed to complain about.
1772180	1776180	Girlfriend not getting along with my designer.
1776180	1778180	Oh, yeah.
1778180	1782180	You guys know how it is.
1782180	1783180	Yeah.
1783180	1785180	Never from the beginning.
1785180	1789180	He's not a good person and they don't get along right.
1789180	1791180	And I think they both fit into the same.
1791180	1797180	If you have a designer, he's coming into your home to do what a girlfriend would do
1797180	1801180	if she moved in with you.
1801180	1803180	That sounded sexist, right?
1803180	1804180	Kind of.
1804180	1807180	But I don't mean that that's what women are supposed to do.
1807180	1810180	I just mean that a person that you're bringing into your home to go,
1810180	1814180	what kind of couch should I get and all this stuff, they're trampling on.
1814180	1820180	You're bringing a professional male nest builder into the nest.
1820180	1822180	Especially me, typically.
1822180	1824180	Maybe this is not true for half the guys here.
1824180	1826180	I shouldn't say this is a thing.
1826180	1829180	But for me, I have no opinions about this stuff.
1829180	1832180	So that professional nest builder comes in.
1832180	1834180	No wrong answers from him, kind of.
1834180	1838180	He is functioning as a girlfriend in that capacity because I am going,
1838180	1840180	I don't know, whatever you want.
1840180	1842180	I don't care about this shit.
1842180	1844180	I secretly do, but I don't know anything about it.
1844180	1846180	I don't know what you're talking about.
1846180	1849180	So it's a friction.
1849180	1850180	There's a friction there.
1850180	1851180	They don't like each other.
1851180	1852180	How does that manifest?
1852180	1857180	He buys a pillow and she says it's itchy.
1857180	1858180	Is it itchy?
1858180	1861180	It's itchy.
1861180	1862180	Erin's right.
1862180	1863180	Okay.
1863180	1867180	But I'm not going to have Erin decorate my house.
1867180	1870180	Jeff, these are things I'm not allowed to complain about.
1870180	1871180	Dan.
1871180	1872180	Thank you.
1872180	1875180	That's the end of the...
1875180	1876180	Okay.
1876180	1877180	I'd like to make one more addition.
1877180	1880180	I think the audience is a little too assertive with their end of the
1880180	1882180	segment applause.
1882180	1886180	I think you've gotten a little too big for your clapping britches.
1886180	1889180	You don't think I know what that means?
1889180	1890180	All right.
1890180	1891180	All right.
1891180	1892180	Now we've reached an agreement.
1892180	1893180	All right.
1893180	1894180	I think.
1894180	1898180	What we do need out of an audience is to be less transparent when they
1898180	1901180	really want to get out of here and we've gone too long.
1901180	1904180	We need it to sound more organic when an applause thing comes up.
1904180	1907180	Because sometimes it sounds like you guys just want us to get off the
1907180	1908180	stage.
1908180	1909180	Don't confuse them.
1909180	1911180	Don't put too much on them.
1911180	1913180	Like I kind of trickle in.
1913180	1914180	You know?
1914180	1916180	Like have a kind of dovetail in it on applause.
1916180	1918180	That was spontaneous.
1918180	1920180	The show is over applause.
1920180	1921180	Here's an example.
1921180	1923180	Throwing my designer into the bus.
1923180	1925180	He was unwrapping a plastic bag.
1925180	1927180	Had a carpet in it.
1927180	1930180	So what are you guys doing for the holidays?
1931180	1935180	We're going to London and Amsterdam.
1935180	1938180	London's dirty.
1938180	1942180	It's a silly thing to say to somebody that just told you they're going to
1942180	1943180	London.
1943180	1944180	What are we supposed to do?
1944180	1947180	Like send an advance team to sweep?
1947180	1950180	We'll try to pick up some shit while we're there.
1950180	1952180	At Christmas time it's covered in snow.
1952180	1953180	It looks gorgeous.
1953180	1954180	All right.
1954180	1956180	We won't go to London.
1956180	1957180	No.
1957180	1959180	It'll be white and beautiful.
1959180	1964180	Just to continue the mire that is tonight.
1964180	1967180	It's like a molasses swamp that we've sunken into.
1967180	1968180	It's sad.
1968180	1969180	It's dark.
1969180	1970180	It's a dark, dark energy.
1970180	1971180	It's a terrible show.
1971180	1972180	It's awful.
1972180	1973180	No.
1973180	1974180	We started off, we were killing the beginning.
1974180	1975180	No, no, no.
1975180	1976180	Well, that political shit.
1976180	1977180	It's a hot button.
1977180	1978180	That's Jon Stewart's shit.
1978180	1979180	It's child's play.
1979180	1980180	He does it every week.
1980180	1981180	Doesn't matter.
1981180	1982180	But you keep insisting on these things.
1982180	1983180	I'm not about to complain about a thing.
1983180	1986180	And then you end it by saying that wasn't very charming of me to complain
1986180	1987180	about these things.
1987180	1988180	You're right.
1988180	1989180	That's not too much.
1989180	1990180	I should fucking barrel ahead.
1990180	1992180	That's my last complaint.
1992180	1993180	Myself.
1993180	1996020	I handle these complaint sections too, too bad.
1996020	1997180	Now applaud Kazoo.
1997180	1999180	All right.
1999180	2001180	Moving on.
2001180	2007180	What do you tip?
2007180	2009180	What the fuck are you supposed to tip?
2009180	2011180	I'm up to like 38% now.
2011180	2012180	Because it just doesn't.
2012180	2013180	I don't know.
2013180	2015180	You see in movies.
2015180	2018180	I'm way above 20% now.
2018180	2020180	And it doesn't matter if you do a bad job or a good job.
2020180	2021180	I can't risk that.
2021180	2024180	I don't know karmically what I'm supposed to do.
2024180	2029180	There's not a single person that has ever served me well or served me
2029180	2035180	that hasn't gotten anything under a 20% tip in the last million years.
2035180	2039180	By default, it's 20% for sure.
2039180	2043180	And then I'll round up even more out of mathematical insecurity.
2043180	2049180	I don't understand it.
2049180	2053180	I hate to rehash the whole Tarantino thing from the beginning of Reservoir Dogs,
2053180	2058180	but it is a weird question because we've made it part of our economy
2058180	2063180	and it doesn't make any sense because it's supposed to be a reward
2063180	2066180	and I'm just tipping everybody.
2066180	2067180	All right.
2067180	2069180	That was my last complaint.
2069180	2070180	What do you think it should be?
2070180	2071180	I don't know.
2071180	2072180	There's no should.
2072180	2075180	If you told me it should be 50%, I believe you.
2075180	2077180	What would make you comfortable?
2077180	2080180	If you set the bar somewhere, what would you want to say?
2080180	2084180	I'm telling you, I swear to God, if you raised me in a society
2084180	2088180	where it was customary to tip 50% of what the thing was, I would go, okay.
2088180	2093180	But I would also go, the word customary tip is kind of a weird,
2093180	2097180	it spirals you into what is going on here.
2097180	2099180	I believe that everybody should tip for services like that.
2099180	2102180	It's part of the gig for service bartenders, waiters, things like that.
2102180	2103180	But you know they've systematized it.
2103180	2105180	They've institutionalized it.
2105180	2107180	Also, under-tipping is bad.
2107180	2111180	I think 20% is perfect, but whatever you can afford.
2111180	2116180	And also, over-tipping is not necessary and also can be a sign of like,
2116180	2119180	it can be like ostentatious.
2119180	2123180	You shouldn't feel the need to tip 50%, 60%, 100%.
2123180	2125180	Like some people do and they've got money.
2125180	2126180	How do I do that?
2126180	2128180	Because it just skews the whole thing.
2128180	2131180	I think just be an honest 20% tip, but let's all do that.
2131180	2133180	Excuse what whole thing?
2133180	2136180	Is there some kind of like, should we meet on like a skull and bones island
2136180	2137180	and talk about it?
2137180	2140180	There was one bartender at Little Dom's who I've known for a long, long time
2140180	2142180	and he said, name him or it didn't happen.
2142180	2143180	I could know.
2143180	2148180	If I knew anybody's name in that place, I would win a fucking toaster.
2148180	2151180	The turnover rate is amazing, but I also don't know the names of the people
2151180	2154180	that have been working there for three years.
2154180	2157180	He said, your friend Dave came in the other day, Dave Lyons.
2157180	2159180	Yeah, Dave Lyons, a great friend of ours.
2159180	2162180	He was a locations manager for community, right?
2162180	2165180	And he's like, yeah, really nice guy.
2165180	2168180	Great tipper.
2168180	2171180	He said it to me like, you could learn a couple things from old Dave Lyons.
2171180	2173180	I'm like, I'm learning.
2173180	2175180	Lots of ball play.
2175180	2177180	Yeah.
2177180	2179180	Lots of ball play?
2179180	2182180	One of the community writers, a girl, Hillary Winston.
2182180	2185180	She probably might be naming her because I think this is probably in her book.
2185180	2187180	Hillary Winston was a community writer season two.
2187180	2190180	I'm sure she tells the story in her book because she tells everything.
2190180	2194180	But she shared this story about breaking up with a guy.
2194180	2196180	It was a very amicable breakup.
2196180	2199180	It was one of those very healthy, like, huh, we're breaking up.
2199180	2200180	We both want to break up.
2200180	2202180	Let's just break up.
2202180	2203180	It's cool.
2203180	2207180	Like, oh, yeah, I guess we're just not going to work out for both of us.
2207180	2212180	At some point in the conversation, it's like, yeah, I think she set herself up
2212180	2216180	by going like, huh, this feels so good.
2216180	2219180	Any thoughts?
2219180	2226180	And he's like, yeah, next time around, next guy, a little more ball play.
2226180	2227180	Awesome.
2227180	2228180	Amazing.
2228180	2229180	Amazing of her to ask.
2229180	2230180	Amazing of him to answer.
2230180	2231180	Amazing answer.
2231180	2233180	What?
2233180	2236180	Good thing that broke up, for sure.
2236180	2240180	The idea that he's saying we're breaking up for maybe a lot of reasons,
2240180	2242180	maybe just one reason.
2242180	2244180	For this guy, yeah.
2244180	2247180	I mean, if ball play's that important and he never mentioned it.
2247180	2251180	He clearly doesn't love her and is not going to miss her if he's suggesting
2251180	2254180	that the next guy she's with gets all the ball play.
2254180	2255180	Give him something.
2255180	2256180	Give, please.
2256180	2257180	This is for the cause.
2257180	2258180	To honor me.
2258180	2260180	Give the next guy you're with all the ball play I never got.
2260180	2262180	That's right.
2262180	2263180	Well, he loves her.
2263180	2264180	He wants her to be happy.
2264180	2265180	Yeah, be happy.
2265180	2268180	And he knows that she'll continue to get dumped if she doesn't play with your
2268180	2270180	balls enough.
2270180	2271180	That's what he's saying.
2271180	2274180	Like, that's why the relationship didn't work out.
2274180	2275180	Yeah.
2275180	2279180	It's not because I'm the kind of guy that gives notes like more ball play.
2279180	2281180	It's not related to that at all.
2281180	2284180	I'm just a regular guy.
2284180	2291180	You, however, you are on the precipice of a life of loneliness if you just got to
2291180	2294180	play with those balls a little more.
2294180	2297180	You look at them, they're perfect.
2297180	2301180	There's only one more thing in my Evernote file, and then we're cast adrift,
2301180	2303180	and then that's why we'll bring up Spencer.
2303180	2305180	I love being adrift.
2305180	2308180	So you knew the Harry Potter series was over, right?
2308180	2310180	No.
2310180	2314180	I thought they were done making movies, but then there's always another book that
2314180	2315180	comes out, right?
2315180	2316180	I don't know.
2316180	2317180	I just don't know.
2317180	2322180	Nobody say anything out loud, because we exist in a fascinating vacuum here.
2323180	2329180	I'm curious how, between the two of us, who knows more about Harry Potter?
2329180	2332180	I would guarantee that you know more about Harry Potter.
2332180	2333180	Okay.
2333180	2335180	I've never read the books.
2335180	2338180	You imply that I've read the books.
2338180	2340180	You don't read books.
2340180	2344180	I have seen all of the movies once.
2344180	2345180	All right.
2346180	2352180	Raise your hand if you consider yourself a Harry Potter...
2352180	2354180	Adam Goldberg's hand shut up.
2354180	2355180	No.
2355180	2356180	He's already getting up.
2356180	2358180	We didn't say stand up, but his hand went up.
2358180	2359180	He said, raise your...
2359180	2362180	And his hand is already in the air.
2362180	2366180	Raise your hand if you're very familiar with the Harry Potter books to the point,
2366180	2370180	and also if you're relatively comfortable getting up on stage, and what I would
2370180	2371180	have you do is...
2371180	2373180	Adam, don't be bashful now.
2373180	2375180	His hand is bashfully up.
2375180	2378180	We have about eight or nine hands in the air, right?
2378180	2379180	I see three.
2379180	2380180	I see two.
2380180	2381180	Okay.
2381180	2382180	One, two, three, four, five, six.
2382180	2383180	How do we choose?
2383180	2384180	Do we...
2384180	2385180	Well, we've been unfair to women tonight.
2385180	2389180	I've heard myself say some sketchy, possibly sexist things, so let's make it a woman.
2389180	2390180	All right.
2390180	2392180	So now we're down to her or...
2392180	2393180	Of the women.
2393180	2394180	There's two that raised your hand up front.
2394180	2396180	Are there other women in the back that raised their hands as well?
2396180	2397180	Well, who cares?
2397180	2398180	I mean, they...
2398180	2402180	Of the two up front, which of you thinks you're the most confident about your
2402180	2403180	knowledge?
2403180	2406180	Did you call yourself a level seven Slytherin?
2406180	2408180	What's your name?
2408180	2409180	Fedora.
2409180	2410180	Fedora.
2410180	2411180	Oh, Fedora.
2411180	2414180	I remember that name and that hat from the Jareth contest.
2414180	2416180	Yes, he made fun of it.
2416180	2418180	All right, Fedora.
2418180	2422180	Let's do five questions, if you can think of them.
2422180	2423180	Don't worry about it.
2423180	2424180	We'll edit it.
2424180	2425180	Okay.
2425180	2431180	Just ask a kind of trivia question about Harry Potter and see who between me and
2431180	2432180	Jeff knows.
2432180	2433180	Oh, brother.
2433180	2435180	And I mean, get basic at first.
2435180	2436180	Okay.
2436180	2438180	How hard do you want me to make this?
2438180	2439180	Find off basic.
2439180	2441180	Find the limits of our ignorance.
2441180	2442180	Okay.
2442180	2443180	Because I'm telling you...
2443180	2445180	I'll tell you some basic things.
2445180	2448180	I bet neither of us know how many movies there are.
2448180	2449180	I do not know how many movies there are.
2449180	2450180	Definitely.
2450180	2451180	I don't know the number.
2451180	2452180	I would be guessing between...
2452180	2453180	I would estimate seven or eight.
2453180	2455180	I would say five.
2455180	2457180	Well, I mean, yeah.
2457180	2459180	But that's a guess.
2459180	2462180	I obviously know the word Slytherin.
2462180	2465180	I think we got a ringer.
2465180	2470180	I saw the first one in the movie theater back when it came out.
2470180	2471180	Nerd.
2471180	2472180	With my parents.
2472180	2473180	Okay.
2473180	2476180	How about I start easy and then make them slightly harder?
2476180	2477180	Yeah, yeah.
2477180	2479180	Dan, you want to make this interesting?
2479180	2480180	Yeah, yeah.
2480180	2481180	20 bucks?
2481180	2482180	40.
2482180	2483180	40?
2483180	2484180	All right.
2484180	2485180	40 bucks.
2485180	2486180	I'll bet you my gardener.
2486180	2488180	But you know Slytherin.
2489180	2494180	I'll see you a gardener and raise you a tailor.
2495180	2496180	All right.
2496180	2499180	Even though I think you know more than me, I think this is a bad bet.
2499180	2501180	So I'll take the $40 bet.
2501180	2502180	All right.
2502180	2503180	Wait.
2503180	2505180	Well, let's put it in Harmon town terms.
2505180	2506180	If...
2506180	2508180	Harmon terms.
2508180	2513180	If I win, you have to...
2513180	2515180	More ball play.
2516180	2518180	I was trying to think of...
2518180	2519180	I don't know.
2519180	2520180	It's stupid.
2520180	2521180	Yeah.
2521180	2522180	Let's make it a nice friendly $40 bet.
2522180	2523180	40 bucks.
2523180	2524180	Yeah.
2524180	2525180	Here we go.
2525180	2528180	I think you're going to kick my ass around the room, but we'll see.
2528180	2529180	Okay.
2529180	2532180	Can you name the four Hogwarts houses?
2532180	2533180	The four houses.
2533180	2534180	Okay.
2534180	2537180	So there's four schools of magic.
2537180	2541180	I know that one is Slytherin because I said that.
2541180	2542180	So one is Slytherin.
2542180	2544180	I didn't know there were four houses.
2545180	2547180	One's called Knuckle Muffins.
2547180	2550180	One's called Gravy Train.
2552180	2554180	And Lolita's Kiss.
2556180	2557180	Poughkeepsie.
2558180	2560180	Magic, magic, magic hat.
2560180	2561180	Magic hat.
2562180	2565180	Dum, dum, dumble, dumble, dumble.
2565180	2566180	Dumbles to grumbles?
2566180	2568180	And bumpers, dumpers.
2569180	2571180	No, neither of us know.
2571180	2572180	Neither of us know.
2573180	2574180	Start basic, we said.
2574180	2575180	Name them.
2575180	2576180	Name them.
2576180	2577180	Name the four.
2577180	2580180	Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff.
2580180	2581180	Hufflepuff.
2581180	2582180	Bumperstumpers is close.
2582180	2583180	Yeah.
2583180	2584180	Wait, no, no.
2584180	2586180	My first one, I said Knuckle Muffin or something.
2586180	2588180	We'll give that one to Jeff, though.
2588180	2590180	Bumperstumpers.
2591180	2593180	Does anybody remember that game show?
2593180	2594180	Yeah.
2594180	2598180	You had to guess what people's personalized license plates said.
2598180	2599180	Yeah.
2599180	2600180	It sucked.
2600180	2602180	Somebody come up with that idea.
2602180	2603180	It was the 80s.
2603180	2605180	It's like when you go into a development meeting and they're like,
2605180	2606180	meet and greet with an executive.
2606180	2608180	Another thing I'm not allowed to complain about.
2608180	2612180	And like, we have this internal idea and it's about, you know,
2612180	2614180	when you go to your tenure reunion, it's like, you never know.
2614180	2615180	So we want to develop a show.
2615180	2616180	It's called Tenure Reunion.
2616180	2618180	Oh, how'd you come up with that idea?
2618180	2620180	You fucking parasite.
2621180	2622180	You 28-year-old.
2622180	2624180	That's an internal idea?
2624180	2625180	You didn't have a writer?
2626180	2629180	Well, since it's a reality show, you'll never need one.
2629180	2632180	Just get six cameras and go fuck everybody.
2633180	2635180	Makes me a little mad.
2635180	2636180	I thought you hated writing.
2636180	2639180	I do, but I don't want it eliminated as a job.
2639180	2643180	I definitely hate washing dishes a lot more.
2643180	2644180	All right.
2644180	2646180	Question number two.
2646180	2648180	First of all, do you want to know what the four Hogwarts houses are in
2648180	2649180	French?
2649180	2651180	Because they're really funny.
2652180	2653180	Oui.
2654180	2655180	Yes.
2655180	2658180	Gryffindor is just Gryffindor for some reason.
2658180	2659180	Not funny.
2660180	2662180	That's why I started with that one.
2662180	2663180	Okay.
2663180	2667180	Slytherin is serpentard, which kind of makes sense.
2668180	2669180	Serpentard?
2669180	2670180	Serpentard?
2670180	2671180	Yeah.
2671180	2672180	Hey, serpentard.
2672180	2673180	Yeah.
2674180	2675180	Nice wand.
2677180	2680180	Ravenclaw is sardagla, which is kind of a direct translation.
2680180	2681180	It kind of makes sense.
2681180	2683180	The Hufflepuff is my absolute favorite.
2683180	2685180	Hufflepuff is poofsouffle.
2686180	2688180	That's on the nose.
2688180	2689180	They would be offended.
2689180	2693180	The French would be offended if we suggested that was their French name for it.
2693180	2694180	Poofsouffle?
2694180	2695180	Poof?
2695180	2696180	Poof.
2696180	2697180	Oh, poof.
2697180	2699180	Oddly enough, that's also a literal translation.
2699180	2700180	Poofsouffle, that's great.
2700180	2701180	I love that.
2701180	2702180	Four more, Fedora.
2702180	2703180	Okay.
2703180	2706180	Can either of you name the monster in the Chamber of Secrets?
2706180	2708180	Sam.
2709180	2710180	All right.
2710180	2711180	All right.
2711180	2712180	All right.
2712180	2713180	Good guess.
2713180	2714180	That sounds like a good guess.
2714180	2719180	I know it'll have a lot of S's in it because he's a snake monster.
2719180	2722180	There's a snake monster down there.
2722180	2724180	There's certainly an S in there.
2724180	2725180	It's not Slytherin.
2725180	2728180	That's the house.
2728180	2730180	It's not serpentor.
2730180	2733180	That's G.I. Joe.
2733180	2736180	It should be serpentor.
2737180	2740180	Cobra-con.
2741180	2744180	Don't tell her.
2744180	2747180	What is it?
2747180	2748180	I know.
2748180	2749180	Who's close?
2749180	2751180	Sam or Cobra-con?
2751180	2756180	Well, Dan, you're closer because it actually is the name of a snake.
2756180	2757180	Oh, okay.
2757180	2758180	What is it?
2758180	2759180	What is it?
2759180	2760180	It's a basilisk.
2760180	2761180	Oh, all right.
2761180	2762180	I'll take that point.
2762180	2763180	Basilisk?
2763180	2764180	Basilisk.
2764180	2765180	Mine had an S in it.
2765180	2766180	I'll take it.
2766180	2767180	Okay.
2767180	2768180	We're tied up.
2768180	2769180	We're all tied up.
2769180	2770180	We're tied at one.
2770180	2771180	Okay.
2771180	2774180	Who were the marauders?
2774180	2775180	What?
2775180	2776180	Is that part?
2776180	2777180	Do you need another one?
2777180	2778180	I'm sorry.
2778180	2779180	All right.
2779180	2780180	No, no, no, no.
2780180	2781180	Let's take a stab.
2781180	2782180	Let's do it.
2782180	2783180	Who were they?
2783180	2784180	Yeah.
2784180	2793180	The marauders were a group of shadow creatures that serve he whose name can't be said.
2794180	2795180	That is totally wrong.
2795180	2796180	Would you like another question?
2796180	2797180	No.
2797180	2798180	I get to guess too.
2798180	2799180	Oh, okay.
2799180	2800180	Yeah.
2800180	2801180	I'm sticking with it.
2801180	2807680	The marauders were those guys that came in and tried to screw up the game of the broomstick
2807680	2808680	ball.
2808680	2809680	Quidditch.
2809680	2810680	Whatever the fuck.
2810680	2811680	Quidditch.
2811680	2812680	Quidditch.
2812680	2814180	The guys that came in and tried to steal the quidditch sticks.
2814180	2815180	Okay.
2815180	2816180	Who's closer?
2816180	2817180	Who's closer?
2817180	2823160	I'm going to say Jeff is closer because he's thinking of the wrong things, but he does
2823160	2825160	know sort of what he's talking about.
2825160	2826160	I can't.
2826160	2827160	I can't.
2827160	2828160	I don't quidditch.
2828160	2829160	I can't just.
2829160	2830160	All right.
2830160	2831160	Yeah.
2831160	2832160	Jeff too.
2832160	2833160	Yeah.
2833160	2834160	That's all it was once, but I'm knowing my shit.
2834160	2835160	Two left.
2835160	2836160	Okay.
2836160	2837660	I got to make the last two really easy because I think that last one was too hard.
2837660	2841300	Well, also you don't give a point to somebody who just says quidditch quidditch like in
2841300	2842300	the middle of it.
2842300	2843300	Yeah.
2843300	2844300	He said yours had a name of a snake in it.
2844300	2845300	That was it.
2845300	2846300	That was fine.
2846300	2847300	Fine.
2847300	2848300	Even Steven.
2848300	2849300	Jeff leads two to one.
2849300	2850300	$40 on the line.
2850300	2857320	He's describing a specific scene from oddly enough, the right book, but yeah, I'm a fan
2857320	2858320	fedora.
2858320	2859320	Yeah.
2859320	2863680	You're not the first woman to fall into his sociopathic web.
2863680	2866740	It sounds like he's all into whatever you're talking about.
2866740	2871720	By the way, you're going to be on the Los Feliz streets with a pair of high heels in
2871720	2874480	your hand in the morning.
2874480	2875480	Okay.
2875480	2876480	What?
2877180	2878180	What?
2878180	2879180	What?
2879180	2880180	Hail in a cab.
2880180	2885180	Boy, Dan, you go down at one point, you turn into a misogynist asshole.
2885180	2887180	Can't you see how good she looks in black?
2887180	2889180	You look great tonight, by the way.
2889180	2890180	Don't let him do it.
2890180	2891180	You look wonderful.
2891180	2892180	Thank you.
2892180	2893180	You're really captivating.
2893180	2894900	He's a basilisk.
2894900	2895900	I was distracted.
2895900	2897900	Is the game over yet?
2897900	2898900	Two to one.
2898900	2899900	Okay.
2899900	2903740	What's the name of the headmaster of Hogwarts?
2903740	2905740	Grumble snakes.
2906000	2907000	Dumbledore.
2907000	2908000	Dumbledore.
2908000	2917000	East side, west side, north side, south, mama's in your titty, dick's in your mouth.
2917000	2918000	Motherfucker's got it.
2918000	2921000	Got that cocaine and the weight stop.
2921000	2922000	Fuck you.
2922000	2923000	Gotta shoot you in the dick.
2923000	2924000	Gotta shoot you in the ass.
2924000	2927000	Gotta fuck your mama at the head of the class.
2927000	2930760	I got Howard Hessman in the place to be.
2930760	2932760	I knew it wasn't grumble snakes.
2932760	2933760	I panicked.
2933760	2934760	Whoa.
2934780	2935780	I thought you had to say it.
2935780	2939140	As in the game of Quidditch that will cost you.
2939140	2942540	You pause one moment and the robot ball will not follow your broomstick.
2942540	2943540	All right.
2943540	2945500	We're tied up at two to two right now.
2945500	2947340	This is a deciding question.
2947340	2948340	Yeah.
2948340	2949340	All right.
2949340	2950340	Forty dollars.
2950340	2951340	Forty magical...
2951340	2952340	Stalamanders.
2952340	2953340	Stalamander notes.
2953340	2962500	I should make that the last question, the units of currency, but I'm not that mean.
2962500	2964960	We're guessing on everything except for Dumbledore.
2964960	2966960	I freaked out and said grumble snakes.
2966960	2968960	No, grumble snakes is good.
2968960	2969960	I like that.
2969960	2970960	Okay.
2970960	2972660	It's a better name.
2972660	2975760	You should write a young adult novel series.
2975760	2976760	I hate writing.
2976760	2978520	That's gonna be a...
2978520	2981000	When I finally start playing Dungeons and Dragons, I think that's gonna be my character
2981000	2982000	name.
2982000	2984040	Grumble snakes?
2984040	2985040	It's like grumble fish.
2985040	2986040	Yeah.
2986040	2987040	Okay.
2987040	2988040	This is it, everybody.
2988060	2992060	This is the fifth and final question.
2992060	2993060	Okay.
2993060	2996220	There's a catch on this one.
2996220	3000500	You have to pronounce it correctly.
3000500	3003380	It's easy, but it's, you know, people get...
3003380	3004820	What's the name of the bad guy?
3004820	3007900	His real name.
3007900	3008900	His real alias.
3008900	3009900	Not his real real name.
3009900	3010900	Yeah.
3010900	3011900	Not your company.
3011900	3012900	I'm not.
3012900	3014540	I'm your man.
3014540	3017780	I know you're not allowed to say his name in the first movie because that's the one
3017780	3018780	I saw.
3018780	3021120	And I know he doesn't have a nose.
3021120	3026280	And I know it's not Slytherin.
3026280	3029040	Vah, pah, askeb...
3029040	3030040	Askebarr...
3030040	3033040	No, no, no, no.
3033040	3034040	Uh-oh.
3034040	3035040	Heathcliff.
3035040	3036040	Uh...
3036040	3037040	Okay.
3037040	3038040	What?
3038040	3043240	William Howard Taft.
3043240	3047760	I went from Heathcliff to Luzania de Garfield to our fattest present.
3047760	3049660	Is that your guess, kid?
3049660	3050660	I don't fucking...
3050660	3051660	For $40.
3051660	3052660	I don't...
3052660	3053660	I'm shooting in the...
3053660	3054660	No, no, no.
3054660	3055660	Let me fucking...
3055660	3056740	I know it's like Dumbledore, but it's like the inversion of Dumbledore.
3056740	3057740	So fumble, fumble, fumble.
3057740	3060020	There's people in the audience right now that are bristling with like...
3060020	3062420	Well, of course they are, because we're not saying Darth Vader.
3062420	3064140	We don't know the name of Darth Vader.
3064140	3065140	Ah, shit.
3065140	3066140	What the fuck is this?
3066140	3070340	You know, it's funny, I didn't realize it was the inversion of Dumbledore, but it kind
3070340	3071340	of is.
3071340	3072340	Whoa!
3072340	3074860	Hey, just getting in the head of an inferior craftsman.
3074860	3076860	There's your dumpledor.
3076960	3078960	Yeah, I'll tell you for $20.
3080960	3081960	Adam, shut up.
3081960	3082960	Imble...
3082960	3083960	Imble...
3083960	3084960	Imble...
3084960	3085960	Imble Fleff.
3085960	3088160	Just counting on getting closer than Jeff.
3088160	3089660	Imble Fleff.
3094660	3096160	I'm gonna say someone from a...
3096160	3098160	No, that's Lord of the Rings.
3100160	3102160	Yeah, I fucking almost went Voldemort on that one.
3107160	3108160	Woo!
3113160	3115160	$40 in my pocket, yo.
3115160	3117160	Bring it over me.
3117160	3118160	Don't throw.
3118160	3120160	I said Voldemort, make it rain.
3120160	3122160	Fedora, everybody!
3122160	3125160	I gave my $20 shit this motherfucker, but I won't give up.
3125160	3127160	Thank you, Fedora.
3127160	3128160	Fedora, everybody.
3130160	3131160	All right.
3131160	3135160	Spencer, get up here and set up your wares.
3136160	3137160	We always do this.
3137160	3139160	We always start Spencer up too late.
3139160	3141160	We always torture these people.
3141160	3143160	That was exciting.
3143160	3145160	How about that?
3145160	3147160	Me coming up with something like Spur of the Moment.
3147160	3148160	Little features.
3148160	3150160	I'm coming up with little features.
3150160	3151160	You're like David Letterman.
3151160	3155160	Except, as if he had a writer that would come up with features for him.
3155160	3157160	Yeah, but I don't.
3157160	3159160	You're like your own writer, Steph.
3159160	3162160	Like if I had a Larry Budd Melman, like Goldberg.
3162160	3163160	Goldberg.
3163160	3164160	Goldberg.
3164160	3165160	Well, Spencer sets up.
3165160	3166160	Goldberg.
3166160	3167160	Come up.
3167160	3168160	Adam Goldberg.
3168160	3169160	Let's visit Adam Goldberg.
3169160	3172160	The show runs itself.
3172160	3173160	Freeze down.
3173160	3174160	Adam, freeze down.
3174160	3175160	Come on.
3175160	3177160	Jockenship Stan, who never says please.
3177160	3181160	I'm back in the cold, and my mic is probably too hot.
3181160	3182160	Justin, I'm sorry.
3182160	3183160	My mic is too hot.
3183160	3185160	I have a loud voice, and I'm sorry.
3185160	3188160	My mic is too warm.
3188160	3189160	It's going to crackle.
3189160	3190160	Sound check.
3190160	3193160	Wait, were you rapping, or was that?
3193160	3195160	He rapped a mic check.
3195160	3202160	I'm sober enough that it was intentional, but not sober enough that it was not on in...
3202160	3204160	Oh, I can't believe Mitt won.
3204160	3205160	I just...
3205160	3206160	We don't know that.
3206160	3207160	It's crazy.
3207160	3209160	Are you up here in the Mitt Romney universe?
3209160	3214160	I was ringing it up and calling it back.
3214160	3218160	I was dialing up a punch line, and no one was on the other side.
3218160	3220160	I'm leaving a voicemail.
3220160	3224160	It's the kind of voicemail where it's just the person just leaves their number because
3224160	3228160	they're too cool for their name, and they might be, you know, a chick you met at a bar,
3228160	3230160	might be an insurance salesman from Milwaukee.
3230160	3231160	Nobody knows.
3231160	3235160	If they call back and says, I'm an insurance salesman from Milwaukee, you have a sense
3235160	3239160	of it, but she could be doing a deep voice and faking it out on you.
3239160	3240160	Let's freestyle.
3240160	3241160	Let's try it again.
3241160	3243160	I'll pass it to you.
3243160	3247160	I'll say, my man Adam Goldberg is going to take it right now, or something like that.
3247160	3248160	All right, Adam.
3248160	3254160	But I'll set you up, and I'll lower the bar.
3254160	3262160	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, bottom to the top, side to side.
3262160	3265160	I fucked your mama and her pussy, and I made it extra wide.
3265160	3267160	This particular chick is so sick.
3267160	3269160	Go, go, go.
3269160	3271160	Don't react.
3271160	3272160	It distracts me.
3272160	3273160	Tell him.
3273160	3274160	Sorry.
3274160	3275160	You're my hype man?
3275160	3276160	Yeah.
3276160	3277160	Okay, I'll try it.
3277160	3278160	Yeah, this one goes out to the ladies.
3278160	3279160	I'm sorry.
3279160	3280160	I'm getting distracted.
3280160	3281160	All right.
3281160	3293160	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, pepper to the salt, steak to the peas, fucked your mama
3293160	3297160	so hard she fell to her knees, begged for more of my dick till dawn.
3297160	3300160	I fucked it on the lawn.
3300160	3302160	Fucked your mama in the backyard in the front.
3303160	3305160	Fucked your mama in the seaward.
3308160	3309160	Sorry, sorry.
3309160	3310160	Good save.
3310160	3311160	Good save.
3311160	3312160	Starting over.
3312160	3313160	Right up in there.
3313160	3314160	Okay.
3314160	3317160	Yo, yo, yo, with my motherfucker right now, Adam Goldberg.
3317160	3318160	Gonna do it up.
3318160	3320160	Gonna give you the good word.
3320160	3322160	Adam Goldberg, the Jewish prodigy.
3322160	3326160	Gonna take you all down to your knees.
3326160	3327160	Let me set you up better.
3327160	3329160	Motherfucker is like a tight sweater.
3329160	3332160	Makes your titties look good for the touching.
3332160	3334160	Motherfucker's gonna be like...
3334160	3337160	Titties be better when I'm with them.
3337160	3339160	I've got the stutch and you got the stiffen.
3339160	3340160	I got a swear word.
3340160	3341160	I won't say it.
3341160	3343160	If this gets radioed, fuck.
3343160	3344160	I'll pray it.
3344160	3347160	Yo, I got curvy spine.
3347160	3349160	I got ladies in a segment that's mine.
3349160	3350160	I say, what?
3350160	3354160	I'll get your bod to spilled all over because that's how I ought to.
3354160	3357160	Spencer is a very good DM.
3358160	3361160	When things drop out, it's sometimes impressive.
3361160	3366160	If I had a rap group, we'd be called The Messes.
3366160	3367160	All right. M.C. Goldberg.
3367160	3371160	M.C. Goldberg.
3371160	3373160	Extemporaneous, yo.
3373160	3377160	I got to say, that took sort of a bittersweet turn toward the end there.
3377160	3381160	Because we both were just wheelchairing across the finish line.
3381160	3384160	Everyone's a winner.
3384160	3387160	Must finish this rhyme.
3387160	3389160	I just technically break the ribbon.
3389160	3393160	Here's a scissors.
3393160	3394160	Thank you, Adam.
3394160	3395160	Thank you, Adam.
3395160	3399160	I can't thank you enough, clearly.
3399160	3402160	Adam, sit down.
3402160	3404160	There you go.
3404160	3405160	He's a good kid.
3405160	3408160	See, Adam, when the little showbiz note,
3408160	3411160	when someone goes, Adam Goldberg, everyone in the car claps,
3411160	3413160	that's outro.
3414160	3416160	You tip your hat and you walk off stage.
3416160	3419160	My theory is that he's neurologically incapable
3419160	3421160	of picking up on a social cue like that.
3421160	3424160	That's my theory as a person who I also...
3424160	3425160	That's also my theory.
3425160	3427160	So now I'm just telling him straight up.
3427160	3430160	From now on, when I say thank you, Adam Goldberg,
3430160	3434160	and the crowd goes like, they make their hands make this sound,
3434160	3438160	that means fuck straight off.
3438160	3440160	You're really controlling tonight.
3440160	3443160	I got $40 burning a hole in my pocket.
3443160	3446160	All right, Spencer, how have you been doing?
3446160	3449160	Right now I'm not feeling too good, you guys.
3449160	3453160	If I underperform or pass out or projectile,
3453160	3455160	vomit or shit, you'll know why.
3455160	3456160	I saw you before the show.
3456160	3458160	I thought you were just high.
3458160	3460160	No, I'm just not feeling too high.
3460160	3463160	Jesus, Spencer, let me Dungeon Master for a change.
3463160	3465160	All right, here.
3465160	3466160	Is he going to play Sharpie?
3466160	3469160	Take the dice.
3469160	3470160	No, I mean, I can do it.
3470160	3472160	For real?
3472160	3473160	Dan, is this a planned bit?
3473160	3475160	Am I going to find out if this is a planned bit?
3475160	3477160	If it doesn't work, we'll put it in the Mitt Romney universe
3477160	3478160	and pretend it didn't happen.
3478160	3479160	Perfect.
3479160	3483160	All right, so Spencer, the Sixler,
3483160	3484160	is going to come up and play...
3484160	3487160	Are you playing Sharpie?
3487160	3488160	Yes.
3488160	3491160	And Harmon is going to sit in and then Dungeon Master...
3491160	3494160	But this is like a what-if comic, you know,
3494160	3496160	like if I fuck it up, it didn't happen.
3496160	3497160	Can I sit?
3498160	3499160	Yes, you may.
3499160	3500160	Make yourself...
3500160	3501160	I'm fat.
3501160	3502160	What?
3502160	3503160	You're not as fat.
3503160	3504160	You're actually...
3504160	3505160	You're quite in shape, I would say.
3505160	3508160	I suck it in in public.
3508160	3509160	That's true.
3509160	3510160	What's wrong, Spencer?
3510160	3512160	Is it serious?
3512160	3513160	Am I fat?
3513160	3514160	No.
3514160	3516160	No, whatever, however sick you are.
3516160	3517160	Oh, no.
3517160	3518160	I don't even know.
3518160	3519160	I just...
3519160	3520160	I'm not 100%.
3520160	3521160	I wouldn't say I'm even sick or anything.
3521160	3524160	Well, will you pass a saving throw?
3524160	3526160	Who knows?
3526160	3528160	Not taking his illness seriously.
3528160	3531160	All right, Harmon, I'm going to give you our new,
3531160	3534160	because of Labyrinth, the Jareth Fest last week,
3534160	3537160	which is wonderful, by the way, for any of you that took part in that,
3537160	3540160	or were here, that really was my favorite Halloween in recent memory.
3540160	3541160	It was wonderful.
3541160	3546160	So I'm going to play you the new D&D theme song.
3546160	3558160	After several key defeats in the area of the Goblin Kingdom,
3558160	3565160	and saving the forest from the forces of Admiral Darkstar,
3565160	3570160	the party known as Sharpie Butz-a-Lot,
3570160	3572160	Quark,
3572160	3579160	Myer Rudolph, whatever her name was,
3579160	3582160	have decided to hit the treacherous road
3582160	3585160	in pursuit of the Butz-a-Lot Shire,
3585160	3590160	which is reputed to be the source of Sharpie's kingdom
3590160	3596160	and former reclamation of his lineage.
3596160	3603160	After traveling very far on a well-packed, well-trodden path,
3603160	3606160	you encountered a fierce bunch of gnolls
3606160	3617160	and quickly took them out with a flurry of spells and missiles.
3617160	3620160	You slept the night away,
3620160	3624160	shook yourselves off and proceeded along the trail
3624160	3627160	to the Butz-a-Lot realm.
3627160	3630160	You arrive into an open field.
3630160	3633160	There are, you see a series of tents,
3633160	3636160	a village of tents laid out before you.
3636160	3640160	There are watch commanders patrolling the area,
3640160	3645160	as is customary in the Butz-a-Lot kingdom.
3645160	3648160	Dan Harmon, everybody.
3651160	3653160	All right, can we restart and have you do it?
3653160	3654160	This is obviously terrible.
3654160	3655160	I thought it was amazing.
3655160	3656160	That was great.
3656160	3657160	No, you would.
3657160	3659160	Let Spencer please restart.
3659160	3662160	Oh, Jesus Christ.
3662160	3664160	It's only going to get worse.
3664160	3668160	Did you hear me struggling to describe tents?
3668160	3670160	I thought you did great.
3670160	3671160	When we last met.
3671160	3674160	Yeah!
3674160	3677160	See, now you're not booing.
3677160	3680160	Our heroes had been in Darkstar Ziggurat.
3680160	3683160	After defeating him, they realized, or did they?
3683160	3684160	I don't know.
3684160	3688160	It just happened that the Ziggurat crumbled to the ground.
3688160	3692160	The dark forest of shadows seemed to be getting more and more
3692160	3695160	safe after his vanquishing.
3695160	3697160	See, this is what I'm talking about.
3697160	3699160	You're making me look like an asshole.
3699160	3702160	You did a great job up there, and I'm not doing good now.
3702160	3706160	You're doing what I'm doing, which is second-guessing yourself.
3706160	3707160	That's the only uncharismatic thing.
3707160	3709160	That's what I best at.
3709160	3711160	All right.
3711160	3714160	Hitting the trail on the way to the Butts' Expanse,
3714160	3719160	home of the Butts-a-Lot tribe, our heroes encountered
3719160	3723160	Knoll Raiders from the White School tribe.
3723160	3726160	After defeating the Raiders, they dusted themselves off
3726160	3730160	and looked at the loot left behind by the Knolls.
3730160	3732160	And now it's up to you guys.
3732160	3733160	All right.
3733160	3736160	Oh, begin scene.
3736160	3737160	So I forget.
3737160	3739160	Show me that loot again, Sharpie.
3739160	3743160	Well, we have just some coins.
3743160	3746160	There's like some tattered armors and maybe a cutlass.
3746160	3748160	Definitely a cutlass.
3748160	3750160	Is it better than my sword?
3750160	3753160	I've got a pretty good sword already.
3753160	3755160	Is it valuable to me to have another sword?
3755160	3759160	Is there a green arrow on the interface next to his video game reference?
3759160	3761160	It says pick up X.
3761160	3764160	But yeah, it's not anywhere near as good as yours.
3764160	3766160	As you can tell, it's a bit rusty.
3766160	3768160	The guard's a bit loose.
3768160	3769160	Yeah?
3769160	3770160	Yeah, I wouldn't take it.
3770160	3772160	All right, I'll leave it there.
3772160	3776160	You were staring at the corpses of dead Knolls.
3776160	3779160	We should probably arrange them as if they were fucking each other
3779160	3781160	when they died.
3781160	3783160	Just to send a message to the Knolls,
3783160	3786160	because I understand them to be a very homophobic culture.
3786160	3788160	But Sharpie, my fear is that that might enrage them
3788160	3791160	and bring down undue wrath upon us.
3791160	3793160	They need to be enraged and self-destruct.
3793160	3797160	The world right now, Jeff, is one in which there's only one war left,
3797160	3800160	the war between the people who own property and the people that don't.
3800160	3803160	These Knolls are the last of the dregs.
3803160	3806160	Wait, are we still doing the Romney universe?
3806160	3808160	This is Obama.
3808160	3811160	All right, whatever. We'll leave them be.
3811160	3813160	Put a gold piece on each of their eyes.
3813160	3816160	I examine my surroundings.
3816160	3819160	You are in a rolling plains.
3819160	3821160	Rolling plains surround you,
3821160	3824160	and a few trees stand on top of a hill to your west.
3824160	3826160	The path bends south.
3826160	3829160	What's the name of the girl that we're traveling with, Maple Leaf?
3829160	3831160	Karen Broadleaf.
3831160	3833160	Karen Broadleaf.
3833160	3835160	So are we close now?
3835160	3837160	We've been traveling for like three days, Karen.
3837160	3840160	Yes. In fact, if I remember correctly,
3840160	3843160	the butt's plains are just over that ridge.
3843160	3846160	She points to a ridge.
3846160	3848160	The butt's plains are just over it.
3848160	3852160	Karen, are all the butt's plains parted by a ridge?
3852160	3857160	Yes, you will find that in the butt's plains,
3857160	3860160	that geographic feature does exist.
3860160	3863160	Interesting. Just going to make a mental note of that?
3863160	3868160	All right. Let's go into the ridge between the butt's plains.
3868160	3870160	Are both the butt's plains?
3870160	3873160	I don't know. Some direction involving the butt's plains.
3873160	3877160	All right. Let's follow that path toward the ridge.
3877160	3882160	Following the well trodden path, you reach the top of the hill.
3882160	3887160	Seeing the view from the ridge,
3887160	3890160	you can see the yellow tent of Yellow Camp,
3890160	3892160	the primary camp of Butt's Allot Camp.
3892160	3894160	Wait, there were tents. How did you know that?
3894160	3895160	Yeah, that's what I mean.
3895160	3897160	It's like he just was reading the future.
3897160	3899160	Orp can predict basic obvious things.
3899160	3900160	Well, what else is going to happen?
3900160	3902160	He's a storyteller, so am I.
3902160	3903160	To a certain extent-
3903160	3905160	You guys colluded before this.
3905160	3906160	Barbarians live in tents.
3906160	3908160	Like house musicians, you know, you're like,
3908160	3911160	ba-na-na-na-na, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3911160	3914160	Ba-na-na-na. There's changes and there's keys and things.
3914160	3916160	This guy's fucking good.
3916160	3917160	Okay.
3917160	3921160	And I'm pointing that out by saying that he said the same thing I did.
3921160	3923160	Edit it out. Edit it out.
3923160	3925160	All right. Tell me about those tents.
3925160	3927160	They are far off. There's one central large tent.
3927160	3929160	And there's a banana monster, right?
3929160	3931160	I mean, we both would put a banana monster.
3931160	3932160	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3932160	3934160	You're sick and I'm fucking around.
3934160	3936160	Everyone wants to get home.
3936160	3939160	Let's all go home.
3939160	3940160	No, Spencer, say that.
3940160	3943160	No, Spencer. Oh, my God. Not you.
3943160	3944160	I meant them.
3944160	3945160	Oh, sorry.
3945160	3946160	You get in for free.
3946160	3948160	They won't call my bluff.
3948160	3950160	Don't tell them that.
3950160	3951160	All right. So, yeah.
3951160	3954160	Yellow tents surrounded by smaller yellow tents.
3954160	3955160	By the way, why on your guest list,
3955160	3958160	Spencer is like he doesn't get paid for his services here.
3958160	3961160	But he sends like a guest list.
3961160	3964160	There's always a person named Symphony.
3964160	3969160	Wait, how does a dungeon master roll with a chick named Symphony?
3969160	3971160	He's fucking good at it.
3971160	3975160	All right. There you go. Thank you.
3975160	3977160	That was my only question.
3977160	3978160	All right.
3978160	3980160	He's got like an entourage.
3980160	3983160	I approached the large yellow tent in the center.
3983160	3985160	You are far ways away from it.
3985160	3987160	You can begin your approach.
3987160	3989160	Beginning your approach.
3989160	3991160	I examine his approach.
3991160	3992160	Examining is your approach.
3992160	3994160	You notice his gate seems a bit stranger
3994160	3996160	than when you first started adventuring.
3996160	3997160	Hey, what gives?
3997160	4002160	I got to hang a piss.
4002160	4007160	Well, there you go.
4007160	4012160	I take a pee and then resume my approach towards the yellow tent.
4012160	4014160	Peeing completed.
4014160	4017160	You see the familiar yellow tents of Yellow Camp,
4017160	4019160	the first of three Butzalot encampments.
4019160	4022160	Nearby, you can see a large mound of dirt as if someone
4022160	4025160	or some army had been digging a massive pit.
4025160	4028160	The closer you get, the weirder things appear.
4028160	4030160	Knolls are invading Yellow Camp.
4030160	4034160	You've seen many knolls and many barbarians,
4034160	4036160	but they don't seem to be fighting.
4036160	4040160	In fact, they seem just to be hanging out and talking with one another.
4040160	4043160	Wait, the barbarians are Butzalot barbarians?
4043160	4045160	These are the Butzalot barbarians.
4045160	4047160	And there's two armies amassed?
4047160	4053160	You can see barbarians from your tribe intermingling with knolls,
4053160	4055160	large hyena-like humanoids.
4055160	4056160	All right.
4056160	4058160	So they see our approach and they're not reacting to it?
4058160	4059160	Well, I'm a barbarian.
4059160	4062160	Wouldn't they be compatriots of mine?
4062160	4063160	Friends, possibly?
4063160	4065160	You're not in a union.
4065160	4068160	You certainly identify with their, you know,
4068160	4071160	thoughts and feelings, but it's a tribe thing.
4071160	4073160	You're not in their tribe, so.
4073160	4076160	But, you know, you get in their heads a bit.
4076160	4079160	Let me just follow my lead, man.
4079160	4081160	I'm related to these people.
4081160	4083160	Do your thing.
4083160	4084160	We approach them.
4084160	4086160	You approach them.
4086160	4090160	Do you want like a parade or like an entourage?
4090160	4092160	You don't have to be sarcastic.
4092160	4098160	I'm just approaching them and going, I go, you know,
4098160	4101160	I hope that my presence is noted as I approach them.
4101160	4102160	Are they ignoring me?
4102160	4103160	Are they...
4103160	4107160	As you get closer and start to wave your hellos to the barbarians,
4107160	4111160	they seem to take note of you before returning to ignoring you.
4111160	4115160	It's been a long time since you've last been at the butts a lot expanse.
4115160	4117160	Perhaps people don't remember.
4117160	4119160	Greet them in grand fashion.
4119160	4121160	Let them know who you are, your lineage.
4121160	4124160	Well, I don't want my first impression to be like a dick, you know.
4124160	4126160	If they're talking to their enemies...
4126160	4127160	They're being dicks.
4127160	4128160	You said hello.
4128160	4129160	They're having some kind of summit.
4129160	4131160	I mean, these are...
4131160	4132160	Those gnolls are...
4132160	4134160	We just killed a bunch of them in the forum.
4134160	4135160	Right?
4135160	4137160	They don't know that.
4137160	4138160	I know.
4138160	4139160	Or do they?
4139160	4140160	Keep it talking.
4140160	4141160	They might know it.
4141160	4142160	Oh.
4142160	4143160	Uh-oh.
4143160	4144160	Oh.
4144160	4145160	All right.
4145160	4146160	We saw nothing.
4146160	4147160	We did nothing.
4147160	4149160	Just deny everything.
4149160	4151160	Okay.
4151160	4153160	This is like a Hope and Crosby movie.
4153160	4158160	I move to within three feet of them and clear my throat.
4158160	4160160	You clear your throat.
4160160	4167160	A gnoll and a tall human dressed in animal skins eyes you with some amount of suspicion.
4167160	4170160	I give them one of these like...
4170160	4176160	Like a poor person in a crosswalk.
4176160	4178160	Like looking at a car.
4178160	4179160	Like, what?
4179160	4180160	What are you going to do?
4180160	4183160	Are you going to marry me?
4183160	4185160	The human approaches you.
4185160	4187160	Eyes locked.
4187160	4190160	He has a very aggressive look on his face.
4190160	4191160	He says nothing.
4191160	4192160	He approaches.
4192160	4194160	He gets within three feet of you.
4194160	4196160	Then two.
4196160	4201160	He stops at two.
4201160	4204160	Greetings.
4204160	4206160	You seem familiar.
4206160	4211160	Something about your features reminds me of someone I know.
4211160	4213160	Yeah, I'm a butz.
4213160	4214160	A butz?
4214160	4217160	You mean a butz-a-lot?
4217160	4218160	Yeah.
4218160	4219160	The very same.
4219160	4220160	Yeah.
4220160	4223160	I am the one that didn't come back.
4223160	4225160	Then you are a former tribesman?
4225160	4226160	Yeah.
4226160	4229160	Sharpie, tell them who you are, man.
4229160	4231160	I'm Sharpie Butz-a-lot.
4231160	4233160	Sharpie Butz-a-lot?
4233160	4235160	See?
4235160	4237160	I shouldn't have to say it.
4237160	4240160	Son of Lord Butz-a-lot?
4240160	4243160	Welcome.
4243160	4244160	Jesus.
4244160	4245160	Guys, guys, guys.
4245160	4247160	It's like pulling teeth with these people.
4247160	4248160	This is why I left.
4248160	4249160	Sharpie Butz-a-lot.
4249160	4250160	Sharpie Butz-a-lot.
4250160	4252160	Just go up and say hi to people.
4252160	4254160	You're so suspicious of everybody.
4254160	4257160	You have to understand, I grew up in a town of 35.
4257160	4259160	You expect a certain modicum of...
4259160	4261160	Yeah, but you've been gone for a long time, right?
4261160	4262160	It's all part of their toot.
4262160	4264160	Just say hey.
4264160	4266160	People, human barbarians gather.
4266160	4268160	Well, the gnolls slowly move away,
4268160	4270160	eyeing you with suspicion and caution.
4270160	4274160	Hey, I didn't want to interrupt your summit with the gnolls.
4274160	4278160	Well, you did.
4278160	4279160	But I mean, that's fine.
4279160	4280160	Like, what's up?
4280160	4281160	Well, what were you talking to them about?
4281160	4282160	What's the beef?
4282160	4284160	We're just, you know, discussing.
4284160	4288160	I mean, ever since Lord Butz-a-lot signed the Butz-blackpaw treaty,
4288160	4292160	all the blackpaw gnolls have been camping with us.
4292160	4297160	See, we figure if we ally, we can destroy the dwarves more handily.
4297160	4300160	Uh-oh.
4300160	4304160	You guys are lying with gnolls to defeat dwarves?
4304160	4308160	Yes, you see, I mean, it's been a long, long time since you've last been here,
4308160	4313160	but the goblins, the kobolds, the wild capybaras, they've all gone.
4313160	4317160	It's the gnolls, the dwarves, and the barbarians.
4317160	4318160	And we're all fighting.
4318160	4321160	And the dwarves are bad to you?
4321160	4323160	We don't like them.
4323160	4325160	They occupy the mountains to the south.
4325160	4329160	The mountains to the south, they're the last stronghold of the dwarves.
4329160	4334160	If we can take this stronghold, we'll be able to control the entire Butz peninsula.
4334160	4339160	I emerge from behind this conversation and force my way right into the center
4339160	4346160	and say, Sharpie, it is your birthright to regain the former glory of this Butz-a-lot tribe.
4346160	4350160	Let's unite with these people and go fight these dwarves.
4351160	4354160	Hold on a second.
4354160	4356160	Where's my dad?
4356160	4358160	I asked this guy.
4358160	4360160	He should be in blue camp.
4360160	4366160	They're making preparations to send a special envoy to the dwarves to negotiate the terms of surrender.
4366160	4372160	Seeing as how the alliance between the gnolls and the barbarians has taken hold,
4372160	4374160	the dwarves are very, very scared.
4374160	4379160	They've been holding up, you know, and fortifying their defenses.
4379160	4381160	But they want stuff.
4381160	4383160	Listen, sorry, guys.
4383160	4386160	A war between humans and dwarves.
4386160	4389160	They're like little fuckers.
4389160	4391160	You're a little fucker.
4391160	4393160	You're a gnome.
4393160	4396160	Look, I'm a...
4396160	4398160	You're a self-loathing gnome.
4398160	4401160	I'm a barbarian, too.
4401160	4406160	You got to ask yourself one day, are you a gnome that became a barbarian
4406160	4410160	or a barbarian that happens to be a gnome?
4410160	4412160	But he aims from law and order.
4412160	4415160	It was one of the black lawyers had to...
4415160	4416160	Sam Waterston.
4416160	4417160	I'd never seen that show.
4417160	4420160	Well, it doesn't... it still applies.
4420160	4427160	The bottom line is that dwarves and humans have lived in harmony in these parts for millennia.
4427160	4428160	Well, listen, at least go meet your father.
4428160	4430160	At least go sit down and meet your father.
4430160	4434160	Listen, how far is blue camp from yellow camp?
4434160	4437160	Just walk out that door and then back inside.
4437160	4439160	There's a door in the tent.
4439160	4442160	A tent flapping an entrance portal.
4442160	4447160	Oh, so we can walk out of one flap and come right back in the same flap and it's just a blue camp?
4447160	4449160	That's what he said.
4449160	4451160	That's how it would seem, yeah.
4451160	4452160	What?
4452160	4453160	Oh.
4453160	4457160	We walk out of the yellow flap and come back at a blue flap.
4457160	4463160	Exiting the tent, you turn around to see that yellow camp has vanished, being replaced with blue camp.
4463160	4468160	A large blue central tent stands in the middle and is flanked by smaller blue tents.
4468160	4472160	You don't know what sorcery has caused this, but you go back inside all the same.
4472160	4474160	You are now in blue camp.
4474160	4476160	There are only human barbarians.
4476160	4479160	They're dressed in slightly finer clothes than the ones in yellow camp.
4479160	4482160	They're discussing, sitting at tables, sipping drinks.
4482160	4484160	You don't see your father.
4484160	4487160	So now you're going to find my dad.
4487160	4489160	Just go up and introduce yourself.
4489160	4492160	Say you're the son of the guy that runs the joints.
4492160	4493160	Say hello.
4493160	4498160	I feel like if we play this right, sideline between you and me, Jeff Davis, Dan Harmon.
4498160	4499160	Right.
4499160	4507160	If I make a big fuss about sitting down with my dad, who's your most famous friend that could come in and play my dad for next week's recording?
4507160	4509160	Do you want me to say?
4509160	4511160	I don't know if he's in town or not.
4511160	4512160	You know what I'm thinking.
4512160	4514160	No, but just tell me, do you think he could get somebody?
4514160	4516160	I will try for one person in particular.
4516160	4517160	All right.
4517160	4519160	So we'll make my dad a cameo.
4519160	4521160	I'm just taking a time out and saying that.
4521160	4523160	And he'll be the dad?
4523160	4524160	Yeah.
4524160	4525160	Oh, that'd be good.
4525160	4526160	Yeah.
4526160	4527160	I think that'd be cool.
4527160	4529160	And it's a role he's born to play.
4529160	4530160	All right.
4530160	4531160	Okay.
4531160	4533160	Spencer, you didn't hear any of that.
4533160	4534160	Timothy Oliphant, everybody.
4534160	4536160	No, I'm kidding.
4536160	4544160	I got to find my dad if it takes all episode.
4544160	4546160	You say to no one in particular?
4546160	4548160	No, I'm saying to you.
4548160	4550160	You say to the dungeon master?
4550160	4551160	Yeah.
4551160	4554160	I'm saying don't find my dad this episode.
4554160	4555160	Yeah, no, I know.
4555160	4556160	Yeah.
4556160	4559160	So you're hitting pause right now because the meeting with the...
4559160	4564160	But we got to do something to bring it into the Dungeons and Dragons segment.
4564160	4567160	Is there a little slug we can hit with our sword and win some gold pieces?
4567160	4570160	Because they always applaud when we kill something.
4570160	4571160	Maybe.
4571160	4573160	You're in blue camp though right now.
4573160	4574160	You don't see your father.
4574160	4578160	Maybe you should ask around and then maybe some like expositional happen for that.
4578160	4579160	All right.
4579160	4580160	I ask...
4580160	4581160	Don't be fulfilled.
4581160	4582160	I examine my asking around.
4582160	4586160	You examine the asking around.
4586160	4588160	Nothing happens.
4588160	4594160	I step forward and say I being but a little...
4594160	4596160	What am I again?
4596160	4597160	A gnome barbarian.
4597160	4599160	A gnome barbarian.
4599160	4601160	My friend is very shy.
4601160	4604160	Where is Lord Butzalot?
4604160	4605160	Lord Butzalot.
4605160	4610160	We've seen him a few days ago but we believe he's in red camp preparing for battle.
4610160	4613160	I walk out of the blue flap and go back in the red flap.
4613160	4615160	You walk out the blue flap.
4615160	4618160	Behind you you see the red tan of red camp.
4618160	4619160	You enter red camp.
4619160	4622160	It's so easy.
4622160	4624160	It's magic you guys.
4624160	4628160	I know I love it but sometimes you need a gnome barbarian to get shit done.
4628160	4635160	Entering red camp you see several generals decked out in full military gear.
4635160	4638160	They're looking at maps and pushing figures around.
4638160	4641160	You still don't see your father.
4641160	4643160	Where is Lord Butzalot?
4643160	4644160	You ask.
4644160	4646160	Everyone turns and looks at you.
4646160	4649160	How did you get into red camp?
4649160	4652160	There's a practice.
4652160	4655160	There's a series of magic flaps you guys.
4655160	4657160	I don't know who's running security at this camp.
4657160	4661160	Who told you of our flaps?
4661160	4666160	We used our keen insight and our awareness of our surroundings.
4666160	4667160	Well well.
4667160	4669160	Tis the little butzalot.
4669160	4670160	Returned is it not?
4670160	4675160	Yeah but I'm a big butzalot now.
4675160	4676160	You may have noticed.
4676160	4677160	Big butzalot?
4677160	4685160	So whatzalot.
4685160	4688160	I remember you Leonard.
4688160	4690160	Dead Eye Duncan.
4690160	4691160	What?
4691160	4692160	Dead Eye Duncan.
4692160	4694160	I remember you Dead Eye Duncan.
4694160	4697160	My Leonard was my little brother.
4697160	4703160	Your whole family always thought that rhyming things constituted a touche.
4703160	4706160	Ever since grandpa ate eyes we just went with it.
4706160	4708160	Sharpie ate eyes?
4708160	4710160	Roller skate eyes.
4710160	4711160	Sharpie.
4711160	4714160	He eyes you with a newfound respect.
4714160	4717160	It's that easy you little fuckers.
4717160	4719160	That's why your clan's not in charge.
4719160	4720160	I pulled Sharpie aside.
4720160	4724160	Sharpie ask him if he likes big butzalot.
4724160	4725160	Jesus for that.
4725160	4729160	All right.
4729160	4730160	Listen.
4730160	4732160	I need to find my dad.
4732160	4738160	I've been out abroad and been gaining experience and fighting human centipedes
4738160	4742160	and just doing all kinds of things.
4742160	4747160	I don't want the story to turn into a different thing.
4747160	4749160	I just want to find my dad.
4749160	4753160	He issues a grunting gurgle and the other war generals leave the premises.
4753160	4759160	He looks to his left and then to his right suspiciously before motioning you to approach closer.
4759160	4761160	What's going on?
4761160	4766160	I wouldn't tell this to anyone but his own son but Lord Butzalot gathered
4766160	4770160	12 of our bravest warriors and left out last night.
4770160	4775160	We think he was on his way to the Dwarven encampment but we can't be sure.
4775160	4776160	All right.
4776160	4777160	Listen.
4777160	4779160	Buddy, you've come with me this far.
4779160	4781160	I'm going to say the same thing to you.
4781160	4785160	I said to Rob Schwab when I quit the Sarah Silverman program.
4785160	4787160	I don't expect you to follow me everywhere.
4787160	4790160	I think that we should go after your father and you should help out
4790160	4794160	and you should be at his right hand during this battle against the dwarves.
4794160	4798160	I think we should wait till next week when possibly there will be some stunt casting.
4799160	4803160	I'm glad you said that but with an emphasis on I don't think we should fight the dwarves.
4803160	4804160	I'm conflicted about this.
4804160	4806160	It sounds like a bunch of shenanigans to me.
4806160	4809160	The only thing that worries me is that we just kicked a bunch of Knoll's asses
4809160	4812160	and your guys are in league with the Knolls.
4812160	4814160	They're going to find out that we've killed a bunch of Knolls
4814160	4815160	and we're going to be in deep shit.
4815160	4817160	We don't have to ever talk about that ever again.
4817160	4819160	They're going to find out.
4819160	4820160	It will never matter.
4820160	4823160	They watch Law and Order 2 probably.
4823160	4826160	Well, at any rate, we both agree on one thing.
4826160	4831160	We're heading out on the trail of my father, father, father.
4834160	4837160	You head out on the trail of your father.
4837160	4840160	And so ends our D&D campaign.
4840160	4843160	Spencer, everybody. Spencer.
4849160	4851160	Yeah, that one's transitional.
4851160	4852160	We're teaming it up for next week.
4852160	4855160	Yeah, I didn't know what we were going to do in that thing anyway.
4855160	4856160	Yeah.
4856160	4858160	I was probably too hands-on.
4858160	4863160	Really, I personally love Spencer and the job that he does.
4863160	4865160	I know that people on Twitter and people listening out there love Spencer.
4865160	4866160	Let's hear it for Spencer.
4866160	4868160	He's fucking annoying.
4869160	4874160	You're saying the love is more genuine for him than it is for Adam Goldberg.
4874160	4876160	I love Adam Goldberg too.
4876160	4878160	What...
4878160	4879160	Fuckin' A.
4879160	4881160	How do we end the show every week?
4881160	4883160	You can just say thank you and you can...
4883160	4884160	No, no, no, no, no.
4884160	4885160	I can say let's hear it for Dan Harmon.
4885160	4887160	No, no, no, no.
4887160	4888160	No, no, no. It won't do.
4888160	4891160	These people deserve better.
4891160	4893160	They deserve something protracted.
4893160	4895160	What's your idea, Adam?
4895160	4901160	Dan Harmon won the 2012 election and he gives a thank you speech to Harmon.
4901160	4903160	It's not a bad idea.
4903160	4904160	Say that again on mic.
4904160	4906160	Adam said...
4906160	4908160	And now welcome your new...
4908160	4911160	It's hot. It's a hot mic. It's a hot mic.
4911160	4912160	No, you're a hot person.
4912160	4913160	Thank you.
4913160	4917160	Now welcome the new President of the United States, Dan Harmon.
4923160	4924160	All right.
4928160	4930160	Wow, I can't believe I won the election.
4930160	4932160	Here's what I'm gonna do.
4933160	4937160	Every war that we were in, we're gonna stay in.
4938160	4941160	Everyone that was poor is gonna stay just as poor.
4942160	4945160	Everyone that was rich is gonna stay just as rich.
4945160	4947160	Nothing is going to change.
4948160	4955160	I'll see you in three and a half years when I start inexplicably defending my position as if it ever existed.
4956160	4963160	I'm a big rich asshole that lords over you and eclipses your life and convinces you that your neighbors are racist pedophiles.
4964160	4972160	Thank you for coming and a happy 2012 to 2016.
4973160	4975160	All right, that was a bummer.
4975160	4976160	No, that was good.
4977160	4978160	That was a bummer.
4979160	4980160	All right.
4981160	4988160	USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
4988160	4990160	You trying to take this country away?
4991160	4993160	Harmontown will remain.
4994160	4997160	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harmontown tonight.
4999160	5001160	I want to thank fedora for coming up.
5001160	5003160	Adam Goldberg is always Spencer.
5005160	5012160	All right, dungeon master Katie Levine, Zach McKeever, Emily Gordon, Daniel Kramer, Justin Marshall, Mo Fathlebab, Jenny Fine.
5013160	5014160	She really shocked it.
5014160	5016160	Once again, I'm Jeff Davis, the comptroller.
5016160	5021160	One more time for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harman, everybody.
5022160	5026160	God bless each one of us and God bless America.
5027160	5028160	God bless you for voting.
