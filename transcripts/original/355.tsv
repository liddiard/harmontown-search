202960	206760	like should we do this, yes we should, and you're like how?
206760	220800	How do we do it, we've lost, oh here you go, I went to Norway, I was at an animation
220800	229120	festival in Fredrikstad, great, I think your story will have to be on hold for at least
229120	239440	five minutes, what the fuck, Rob's got a table, Rob has got five dollars everybody
239440	250840	you can watch, it's Nosferatu, what is the eyebrows, the eyebrows are like I did it,
250840	261520	I nailed it, what did you do, you didn't do anything, yeah, yeah, I got off of one
261520	268920	of your piece of shit chairs, and there's a stack of considerably more comfortable chairs
268920	286160	right there, a stack, a stack with cushions and a Dracula cape, so I shit my pants, well
286160	296440	on the plane from Norway to Heathrow, the whole time, well I was kind of sitting in
296440	301440	it without knowing it the whole time, how do you not know you shit your pants, it happens,
301440	311200	it happens, I woke up, I think you know, I think you know, at least you're suspicious,
311200	317200	you are suspicious, this is a first, as we know I've had many stories where I didn't
317200	323000	know what I thought was a fart was a shit, but then pretty much the story ends with it
323000	329040	coming out into my pants, but this was different, I woke up from the hotel room the day of our
329040	334080	departure and I was kind of blowing a lot of farts, I drank a lot of beer and ate a
334080	340400	lot of delicious stuff and I'm just farting all over the place and they're big, empty,
340400	344880	winged-y farts, you know, they're not really hurting anybody, they're not bothering anybody,
344880	352360	they're just sort of victimless farts, they're loud and fun and we're laughing about them
352360	359240	and I'm like, and we get to the airport, we get on the airplane and you know, I get
359240	363240	another big one brewing in me, but I'm not going to do it in the cabin.
363240	368240	This is a flight from Norway to Heathrow then connecting back to LA.
368240	369240	Yeah.
369240	371040	Okay, so how long a flight is that?
371040	373440	London being the Chicago of Europe.
373440	374440	Right.
374440	377440	So this is what, this is what, like a two hour flight, two and a half hour flight?
377440	383680	Yeah, two hour flight on one of those flights where they're happy to take your first class
383680	391960	money but the plane is simply a bus and for your first class money what they'll do is
391960	398160	they'll take that money and they'll put a tray in the middle seat in the front four
398160	403320	rows so those people all paid extra money so they didn't have to rub their arm on a
403320	410680	poor person and that's first class but you can't buy people not rubbing your fucking
410680	415680	head as they walk by, people bumping you with their jackets, I mean, everyone's crammed
415680	416680	in the same fucking bed.
416680	418680	That's why you got to get the window seat, baby.
418680	425400	No, that would be code easy as you get the window seat, but so I go to the bathroom during
425400	430120	that flight and I'm peeing and yeah, men, when we pee, like if you've ever been in a
430120	435000	public restroom with men at urinals, like they take the opportunity and maybe it's
435000	438200	partially, it's kind of, it kind of happens while you're peeing, it tends to happen, it's
438200	444880	like a time to fart and sometimes you kind of like, you're in a men's room and you hear
444880	450560	and somebody's like, blah, like at the urinal and you kind of like have this reaction like,
450560	453280	what the fucking guy's just farting.
453280	454280	In the bathroom.
454280	457120	Yeah, but it's, how dare you.
457120	463360	Are you, are you my, are you my jokes agent?
463360	464360	He's here, everybody.
464360	467900	My joke has representation.
467900	473360	Is this a package deal and this joke or the fuck did you think I was pointing out, you
473360	479520	fuck?
479520	485960	So anyways, I go to the, I go to the men's room or the, or the people's room on the plane.
485960	487720	There's no men's room.
487720	490680	Planes are the future.
490680	496520	And I'm peeing and then I just, I just let out this, you know, it's loud.
496520	497520	It was, it was loud.
497520	499160	It was kind of a contrabassoon.
499160	502240	Because I'd been sitting on it and I've been very, I've been very gassy, but I've been
502240	503240	sitting on this one.
503240	512280	So a builder was, whoa, a horn of gondor, and then I go back and I sit for an hour and
512280	518520	57 minutes and then we land in Heathrow and everyone starts doing their little restless
518520	524000	bustling, like getting ready to get up and I'm moving around and I'm like, Oh, what did
524000	526560	I sweat in my butt crap that much?
526560	528360	Is there a substance?
528360	534600	And then I kind of stood up in the, in the seat and I'm like, that feels like wrong.
534600	535600	That feels wrong.
535600	541760	And also it smells a little bit like, like butt release.
542760	546760	Well, because since, because smell is like this crazy sense memory, the thing I always,
546760	550840	when I smell like diaper smell, I always remember my sister's hospital because I was like, I
550840	557120	was like, when I was a kid, that was the first time I'd ever been around like adult poo poos
557120	561280	was this institution where my sister was being housed.
561280	565920	And I've, I've told the story before about the, the Moo Moo guy.
565920	571080	How much time had elapsed since you think you like released the poo poos and then you,
571080	576680	and then you noticed, well, it was when I said, I said, I said two hours and two hours.
576680	581080	And so I guess I was just sitting on it like, like, like a, and so then I, and then I'm
581080	582080	so I'm walking in the airport.
582080	584040	I'm like, I got to wipe my ass, honey.
584040	586000	Like I, and she's like, why did you shit your pants?
586000	588640	I'm like, no, I, that's crazy.
588640	589640	Obviously not.
589640	590640	That would be insane.
590640	595400	If I, if I did that, then there would have reacted to that.
595400	599600	I just have to wipe my sweaty fat ass, you know, traveling.
599600	600600	It's an airport.
600600	601600	It's something that happens.
601600	606640	I guess I just have to wipe my sweaty ass and then we get to the airport lounge and
606640	607640	it's all packed and stuff.
607640	610800	And there's a, there's a guy sitting there like looking at his phone.
610800	616280	It's one of these, like, you know, the bathroom is like, it's like all these, like, you know,
616280	621320	like fancier than like America kind of tends to go for the just metal stalls.
621320	627860	But Europe, in Europe they have, you're more likely to get these like closets, teak, maybe
627860	631340	some, some exotic hardwoods.
631340	635220	And so it's just a room like lined with all these kind of like little rooms that are kind
635220	639780	of impenetrable and it's, it's sort of hard to see vacancy or occupied.
639780	644320	I guess there's a little red thing, but it's not, it's not like, it's not really like beamed
644320	645320	out to your eyeball.
645320	649220	You kind of have to crouch and look and there's a guy standing there, thumbing on his phone.
649220	651060	It looks like he's probably, what the hell is he doing?
651060	652660	He's got to be waiting for one of these bathrooms.
652660	653660	It means they're all occupied, right?
653660	657660	And so I get behind him and I'm waiting and waiting and looking around and there's, there's
657660	660820	a bathroom with its door kind of like not all the way closed.
660820	664380	And I wait and I wait and I'm like looking at it and I'm hoping he sees my eye contact
664380	667420	and then he realizes maybe he missed a bathroom opening.
667420	670460	And then I finally go, is that one open over there?
670460	676460	And he's kind of like blithely, like suppose he's like, go for it, go, no, he didn't say
676460	680600	governor, but like he is like, he was like, he was just like, check it out or something
680600	681600	like that.
681600	685540	It was like, it was like, like go nuts or something like blithe kind of like, like have
685540	686540	a blast.
686540	690620	The old school British phrase, go nuts.
690620	698540	So then I went over there, I open it up and it's a handicap version of all these things.
698540	705260	So I'm like, ah, ah, ah, and I look back at him and he, I don't know if he's like, you
705260	709580	know, is it like Forest Whitaker in the dream and crying game where he's like laughing?
709580	712300	I was like, ha ha, it's a handicap stall.
712300	715020	I told you to, I told you to check it out and now you're,
715020	718940	I never saw grinding crying game.
718940	721100	Oh, anyway, it doesn't matter.
721100	722100	It doesn't matter.
722100	723100	Don't get distracted.
723100	724100	I've seen that.
724100	725100	So now I get it.
725100	726100	Okay.
726100	728220	So, so I just like, I got the door open.
728220	729220	It's a bathroom.
729220	732740	There's no, there's nobody, there's no special needs people in sight.
732740	734140	I'm kind of like, I don't know what the etiquette is.
734140	738580	I don't know if that guy was like, no stop.
738580	740500	No Forest Whitaker.
740500	742220	You're free to go shit occur.
743220	744420	And I have a sweaty ass.
744420	747420	So I'm like, all right, well, I need this up till now.
747420	748420	You don't know that.
748420	750220	Like, what's, what is actually in denial.
750220	751220	Okay.
751220	752220	Gotcha.
752220	757500	So I go in and I, we're two hours, 15 minutes into you having shit yourself.
757500	758500	I unbutton my pants.
758500	759500	I pull them down.
759500	760500	I grabbed the toilet paper.
760500	767660	I wipe at the sweaty butt and I pull it away and it's like, holy fudge, like, like, like
767660	779180	just covered, like as if I just took a shit, which I guess I did, um, not to be disgusting,
779180	782940	but opaque, not opaque chunk.
782940	783940	Just gross.
783940	788380	Just like, imagine taking a shit and then fucking sitting it in, no, that's not like
788380	789380	an intact turd.
789380	795900	A turd wouldn't like, it's not like a, so it isn't anything then go continue with your
795900	796900	turds.
796900	803820	Wait, Jeff, what did you write down?
803820	804820	Holy fudge.
804820	809300	I knew it.
809300	811740	It's important that someone documents this shit.
811740	816500	So now that I'm seeing it, I'm like, okay, well, that wasn't sweat.
816500	820700	And then I'm like, well, hopefully it was just one of those things where like, I was
820700	825340	like a, you know, that wet of a, that productive of a fart.
825340	830380	And like, and it's just like, I had like, like my big bear, like ass cheeks just kind
830380	835900	of contained this grand Canyon of poop and like, I wiped it away and I look in the underwear.
835900	836900	I'm like, whoa.
836900	837900	Oh no.
837900	844180	Hershey's Rorschach like fucking like, it's like the watchman in there.
844180	845180	Yeah.
845180	847780	How do you spell Rorschach?
848780	851900	Watchman in your pants.
854900	857500	Rorschach, take off my shoes.
857500	858500	Take off my pants.
858500	859500	Take off your shoes.
859500	860500	Yeah.
860500	861500	Take off your pants.
861500	863220	You got to take off your shoes.
863220	869540	I take, I take off my underwear, gingerly step out of them, like tires in the, in a,
869540	877620	in a, in an army training course and, uh, fold up really, uh, uh, unreturnable pair
877620	886660	of me undies and, uh, which by the way, are made of the softest micro model and they have
886660	891300	a hundred percent guarantee so you can send them right back if you're not satisfied.
891300	896860	Well, you can, you can take that up with the, with the good people of British airways.
896860	897860	Yeah.
897860	898860	Yeah.
899180	900180	Yeah.
900180	901180	Keep going.
901180	902180	Keep going.
902180	905900	Whatever poor physically challenged person that actually had a right to use that particular
905900	910780	bathroom is now going to go in there and go like, oh, who fucking shit in the garbage
910780	911780	can?
911780	912780	In the toilet area.
912780	918340	Uh, and the ironic answer is, oh me, fucking Mr. Physical Privilege, Mr. bounding around
918340	919620	on two great legs.
919620	923500	I had to fucking like ruin their haven.
924500	927980	Say, and I put, I had to put on my pants.
927980	928980	Wait, sorry.
928980	931100	Can I walk it back for a second?
931100	932100	You took your shoes off.
932100	933100	Yeah.
933100	934220	You took your, took your trousers off.
934220	935220	Yeah.
935220	937540	Take your, took your me on these off, dispose of them.
937540	938540	I assume.
938540	939540	Put them in the car.
939540	940540	More or less.
940540	941540	Then.
941540	942540	Wait, wait, wait.
942540	943540	Is there a garbage can in the stall with you?
943540	950180	It's, it's, it's, I mean, it's a handicap, uh, uh, uh, stall in a country that doesn't
950180	953900	really, in an airport lounge, it's like more into water closets than stalls.
953900	955740	So we're talking about like kind of a small room.
955740	956740	Okay.
956740	957740	So there was a trash can.
957740	958740	Yeah.
958740	965820	So, so you, you pitched your, uh, soiled me on these into the bin and then bearer cleaned
965820	966820	yourself up.
966820	967820	Hopefully.
967820	976340	Then put your, did me on these save your trousers from the, uh, from the, from the, of course
976340	977340	they did.
977340	980100	But I will say, especially why do you think they did?
980100	982820	Just because of micromodal fabric.
982820	985100	All right.
985100	989580	But I will say in all fairness, I was wearing brown pants.
989580	990580	Yeah.
990580	999500	So that's pro tip pro tip, but also a margin of error in my data.
999500	1004620	I think I got it way clean, but if I didn't, I don't know if that's right, you're not,
1004620	1006340	you're, you're going commando.
1006340	1008420	I go commando back to my duffel bag.
1008420	1012180	I look at Dino and Cody and I go, he knows in the bathroom with you.
1012180	1019020	No, I go back to the lounge and I get my, I get a new pair of me undies out of my duffel
1019020	1020020	bag.
1020020	1029140	Um, and as I look at them and go, you know, and Trump's on TV bragging about how he killed
1029140	1037020	the head of ISIS and I'm like there, you know, it's a, it's a day of gives and takes day
1037020	1041500	of triumphs and defeats.
1041500	1042860	I am having a bad day.
1042860	1044900	The president is having a good day.
1044900	1047640	That's usually how it works.
1047640	1056540	So I salute the television and hey, hey, did you guys know that when you're in Europe,
1056540	1062820	you know, it's, it's crazy cause like, uh, um, they, they, their news coverage makes
1062820	1072300	him look like a fucking idiot.
1072300	1076260	It's probably the only time in our nation's recent like post television history when there
1076260	1081140	actually is no fucking disparity because it's like just as mean to be objective with that
1081140	1082140	guy.
1082140	1087020	He's just like, but you know, fucking, uh, Al Jazeera says the same shit about him as
1087020	1092140	CNN because it's just like the president just said he was nine feet tall and his dick
1092140	1093500	is a whistle.
1093500	1098460	Like what, what, what negative spin are you going to put on that?
1098460	1103460	You either, you either pretend that's cool or, or, or you just tell people what happened
1103460	1104460	again.
1104460	1110940	Um, so anyways, yeah, uh, I went back in and I, uh, used a different style thereby realizing
1110940	1116740	how lucky I was because yeah, the other stalls, they don't have garbage bins and uh, I don't
1116740	1117740	know what I would have done.
1117740	1122620	I would have walked out with a fucking lot of shit in a, in the softest fabric known
1122620	1123620	to man.
1123620	1124620	I was worried for you.
1124620	1125620	I don't know.
1125620	1130220	I've had to throw out underwear before in a public place.
1130220	1131220	So
1131220	1136580	so you go back in, you change your, uh, a little quiet there.
1136580	1137580	Yeah.
1137580	1138580	You do it.
1138580	1139580	Me and these change.
1139580	1140820	You put the Brown trousers back on.
1140820	1141820	Yep.
1141820	1142820	No harm.
1142820	1143820	No foul.
1143820	1144820	Yep.
1144820	1145820	All's well.
1145820	1146820	Soiler alert.
1146820	1147820	Hmm.
1147820	1148820	Oh boy.
1148820	1149820	Yeah.
1149820	1150820	Good one.
1150820	1151820	Yeah.
1151820	1160820	Oh, bring out the, the, bring out the inflatable person.
1160820	1164140	Oh boy.
1164140	1166260	Should she come out every time you nail one?
1166260	1170620	I'll tell you what, I could, I could use some vodka right now.
1170620	1171620	Oh shit.
1171620	1177940	We better bring out Steve Levy at some point.
1177940	1184340	Oh, so before the show happened, Steve Levy came out a few times and was treated to just
1184340	1188540	a thunderous applause and audience reaction.
1188540	1192180	Was that because of last week when we talked about it or was that just organic?
1192180	1193180	Okay.
1193180	1194180	I'm hearing some yeses.
1194180	1195180	I thought so.
1195180	1196180	What, what happened?
1196180	1197180	Good to hammer out.
1197180	1201500	Well, we just kind of, we kind of joked about how Levy came out before the show that we
1201500	1207180	can't, the show was tremendously delayed last time, more than usual and, uh, like as
1207180	1226380	a, yeah, Oh, cause that joke was so good earlier and it's a tender moment for us all to enjoy.
1226380	1232500	Yeah, there's no, by the way, there's no guests tonight.
1232500	1233820	So this is it.
1233820	1239820	There's a person in there.
1239820	1240820	That is correct.
1240820	1242940	Oh, you should do something about it.
1242940	1244740	How many more, I'm bad at math.
1244740	1246820	How many more harmonies are there?
1246820	1247820	Five.
1247820	1248820	Five more.
1248820	1254740	So this, this is the five more after this or this five more after this, this one and
1254740	1255740	five more.
1255740	1256740	Six.
1256740	1257740	Six.
1257740	1258740	Five.
1258740	1268020	One in five, five point seven two, right about.
1268020	1269020	What did Dan hear?
1269020	1271260	Uh, no, I just heard this like high pitched tone.
1271260	1273580	That's that fan that, that's that fan.
1273580	1277620	What inflates the wacky with plating and play the warm flailing to me, but there's a lady
1277620	1278620	in there.
1278620	1279620	Woman.
1279620	1280620	What?
1280620	1281620	Woman.
1281620	1282620	Not man.
1282620	1283620	I said it bad.
1284380	1288820	Oh, I thought you were saying, I should say woman instead of lady.
1288820	1290820	No, you should though.
1290820	1291820	Why not?
1291820	1297340	Don't, we'll talk after the show.
1297340	1305620	There was, uh, there was a, but we won't though, I mean, I'm busy.
1305620	1307380	What did Dan hear?
1307380	1315220	There was a, there was a lady animator, a legendary Norwegian lady animator getting
1315220	1322020	a lifetime achievement award in the, at the festival.
1322020	1329340	And the host was going over her credentials and I swear he said, I Cody and I both heard
1329340	1330340	the same thing.
1330340	1338260	He said, uh, and of course, um, if you are familiar with, uh, animation at all, then
1338260	1346860	you know, the movie poop van two, she worked on that and, and then he just kept going and
1346860	1352100	Cody and we were like, and then afterwards we were asking about it, but no one, no one
1352100	1353100	could tell it.
1353100	1358380	No one was like, oh no, no, no, goop, gum do it's a, it's like our Jumanji, like there
1358380	1360140	was nothing.
1360140	1361920	No one, no one remembered hearing it.
1361920	1363460	No one could explain.
1363460	1366580	It was just, I swear he said poop van two now.
1366580	1372620	And the only, the only differing opinion about that was Dino who heard poop man to Cody and
1372620	1376660	I both heard poop van two and it was like the idea that they, I mean, that sounds like
1376660	1384100	a great animated film, the sequel of one at least.
1384100	1387180	And then there was, and then there was more, what do you think, what do you think poop
1387180	1391700	man two, uh, does it answer the questions of poop man?
1391700	1393220	I don't know, but I don't poop man two.
1393220	1397060	I don't, I wouldn't even care about, but poop van two, I just, I guess it's like a great
1397060	1401820	movie cause like there probably is a poop man in that movie, but he's accompanied by
1401820	1407780	three to five friends and a dog and they're all pretty comfortable and I don't know.
1407780	1414180	I just picture like kind of a cool like road movie or something poop van two like poop.
1414180	1418540	There was a movie called poop van and it, and it, and in spite of its obstacles, it
1418540	1422780	did so well that people were like, yes, another.
1422780	1428500	I heard that the poop man was so long they cut it into two pieces.
1428500	1430900	Oh, it was like a, like a kill bill.
1430900	1431900	So yeah.
1431900	1440300	They had to use that special fork that we all keep in the bathroom to break it up.
1440300	1441300	You know what I'm talking about.
1441300	1442300	That's special pork.
1442300	1444700	We all keep in the bathroom.
1444700	1450940	Another thing that the guy said, which he said she also did, he goes right on his phone
1450940	1456860	after saying that I'm looking up, I'm looking up the body of your bathroom.
1456860	1462300	Is it maybe port van to pork van port van port van.
1462300	1463300	Yeah.
1463300	1464300	I'm looking up her filmography.
1464300	1466220	Oh, that would have been a toe.
1466220	1470140	It's probably just very likely that that's what he said.
1470140	1474460	It's less likely that she worked on both that and poop van too.
1474460	1481580	There's also a two band Toby, two van Toby, what did you, what did you think that was
1481580	1482580	Dan?
1482580	1486540	Uh, but another thing that she worked on, apparently that the guy that they were going
1486540	1492580	to show that, that weekend to the guy said, uh, uh, something like he goes, uh, and she
1492580	1510100	just did work on the only educational video about sexual assault of kindergarteners for
1510100	1511100	kindergarteners.
1511100	1517860	And it was just the way that he kept like, he kept, he, it was, it was like, he was like,
1517860	1518860	I don't know.
1518860	1522020	It just sounded like such an inappropriate like advert time.
1522020	1527580	Like, like if you thought sexual assault of kindergartners was a fucking thing from the
1527580	1534420	point of view of the kindergartener, uh, seemed like the audience every time he was before
1534420	1542340	he let in would be like the first animated, wait a sec, kindergarten, I don't think it's
1542340	1546540	a good financial model to really like pitch your film for kindergartners because they don't
1546540	1548420	have a lot of discretionary money.
1548420	1551940	Well, I don't think I, you know, I think, I don't, I think this was probably a job that
1551940	1556060	she did for the government because it was educational.
1556060	1561700	I think if the budget was probably fixed, um, how was you, how was your time overall
1561700	1562700	in the, in Scandinavia?
1562700	1563700	It was a lot of fun.
1563700	1565340	Those are, those are, those are good people.
1565340	1572340	I, uh, I like, uh, you know, they're, they're self described as a kind of like compartmentalized
1572340	1577620	people that they're sort of, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a colder climate.
1577620	1582260	Um, and whereas you might think, Oh, then that, that makes them all warm and fuzzy.
1582260	1586860	Uh, they're, they're a little more, you know, more than, more than a few of them kind of
1586860	1594660	self described to the Norwegian people as being kind of, uh, uh, uh, not cold, but like,
1594660	1597660	uh, uh, yeah, I would say compartmentalized.
1597660	1600340	They didn't use that word, but listening to them describe it, that's sort of what they're
1600340	1604220	describing like, which kind of, you know, it's like they, they, they, and they like
1604220	1612820	to get drunk and like they sort of view getting drunk as like its own thing and what happened
1612820	1614700	there stays there.
1614700	1619220	And uh, one of, one of them described the, the, the, the culture is sort of like, and
1619220	1622980	this is one person, like it might be their own point of view of this isn't like a traditional
1622980	1629020	thing, but like, you know, like in, in Norway, you might get drunk and like have a great
1629020	1632580	time with somebody, even sleep with them or something, and then you see them the next
1632580	1636500	day at a grocery store and you kind of don't, just don't pretend you act like you never
1636500	1637500	met them.
1637500	1644020	Um, that could be that own person's, uh, take on life, but, uh, but, but, but, but the general
1644020	1648140	picture all kind of averaged out was this sort of like, uh, this kind of Nordic, like,
1648140	1651500	uh, yeah, compartmentalized, which I, which I do respect.
1651500	1657060	I like, I, I, I, I, as long as it's not dishonest and nobody gets hurt, I like, I like the idea
1657060	1660340	of distance, professional distance and things.
1660340	1664300	They're not big huggers they said and things like that, but they are, there's a difference
1664300	1665780	between that and not being nice.
1665780	1671220	They're really wonderfully nice and funny, uh, people and they all kind of look like
1671220	1677780	Spencer or Dave Klein and, uh, and, and, and they're, they're just very like, uh, it's
1677780	1683300	hard to escape the Viking thing because they're so jolly and, and, and, you know, broad shouldered
1683300	1688980	and kind of like, um, uh, you know, hyperbolic and, and fun.
1688980	1690380	And it was, so it was great drinking.
1690380	1691380	Like Vikings.
1691380	1692380	Yeah.
1692380	1696380	When I think, when I think fun, fun, fun, fun, I think fun, I think Vikings.
1696380	1697380	Yeah.
1697380	1698380	They got those fun hats.
1698380	1700740	Before the circus came to town, like the Vikings did.
1700740	1705940	I was, I was only in like, I was in Stavanger, Norway once and, uh, there was a bar, people
1705940	1711500	got in fights, like a middle aged guy tackled a slightly older guy and hip tackled him like
1711500	1712820	a linebacker.
1712820	1715580	And then they got up and then danced together and had a drink.
1715580	1719860	And it was like, like no harm, no foul, no blood, no ambulance, ever.
1719860	1720860	Everything was groovy.
1720860	1722220	No antelopes.
1722220	1723300	What's a hip tackle?
1723300	1724300	What's a who?
1724300	1725860	What's a hip tackle?
1725860	1728060	Like when you tackle somebody by the hip.
1728060	1729060	Their hip?
1729060	1730060	Yes.
1730060	1731060	Okay.
1731060	1736580	I mean, if you tackle somebody with your own hip, I think that's just called doing the
1736580	1737580	booty bump.
1737580	1738580	Yeah.
1738580	1741480	That's, that's what I think when I hear a hip tackle, there were, there were more than
1741480	1745560	there was a handful of people who traveled like great distances by train and car from
1745560	1751880	all over Europe to come and to see, uh, uh, me in particular, because, uh, of harm in
1751880	1752880	town ending.
1752880	1757740	It was surprising to, to, to encounter people from, from, uh, from Norway that were like
1757740	1759840	such big harm in town fans, you know?
1759840	1761360	Why wasn't I invited?
1761360	1766080	Uh, because we, I guess we, we didn't know that I was going there for, uh, to talk to
1766080	1767080	them.
1767080	1771400	How do they say Rick and Marty in, uh, in Norwegian?
1772400	1775400	Uh, Rick and Bologor.
1776400	1777400	Awesome.
1777400	1783920	Uh, I did try to write a song in Norwegian thinking if I, I could think maybe if I chipped
1783920	1787360	away at it for over a couple of days, like, oh man, writing, writing a song in a foreign
1787360	1790880	language is, is like, like that you don't actually know.
1790880	1796400	I mean, because in, in, in, in English, you're a brilliant songwriter.
1796400	1800400	Yeah, of getting an Emmy for it.
1801400	1803400	Is some kind of metric.
1803400	1804400	All right.
1804400	1805400	Okay.
1805400	1813400	I mean, I, I never bring it up, but you kind of did, uh, what was the, uh, what was your
1813400	1817000	like eyes into the Norwegian language that you thought you could do it?
1817000	1821960	Well, it just, it was more the eyes in, well, well, I didn't, I, I stopped short of trying
1821960	1827360	to rhyme because I started, it was such a challenge to just, cause you're thinking in
1827360	1830320	a melody and then you're thinking of syllables.
1830320	1834680	So then you're, you think in English syllables and then you go like, oh, I want, I, you know,
1834680	1837880	the other day I had a sausage and you're like, that's the right amount of syllables.
1837880	1838880	Now you got it.
1838880	1839880	Now you're going to put that in Google translate.
1839880	1843720	You're going to find out how to say the other day I had a sausage in Norwegian is going
1843720	1845160	to be totally different amount of syllables.
1845160	1846840	So now are you going to adjust the melody?
1846840	1849800	Are you going to like rephrase or are you going to search around for words?
1849800	1855480	It's like, and then on top of that, now you got to look at the word that it's ending with,
1855480	1859000	I guess, which is going to be like Margabar and you're going to be like, Oh, I know what
1859000	1860000	rhymes with that.
1860000	1861000	No, you don't.
1861000	1862000	You don't know.
1862000	1865800	You don't know a single word that rhymes because you don't know the language.
1865800	1870800	So I was kind of like, wow, that was an interesting, I kind of thought in the day of Google translate
1870800	1876600	and you know, just I underestimated the difficulty.
1876600	1877600	Did you get one done?
1877600	1881720	No, no, I just got, I got like the first line of something done and I kind of tried it out
1881720	1882720	at my panel.
1882720	1885080	Did you try finding like a Norwegian rhyme dictionary?
1885080	1886800	I don't know if they're, I mean, what would it be called?
1886800	1888200	I don't know the word for rhyme.
1888200	1894440	Well, if you wrote typed in Norwegian rhyme dictionary, you know what?
1894440	1895440	This guy.
1895440	1896440	I didn't try that.
1896440	1897440	Yeah.
1897440	1901400	You figured out how I could have done it.
1901400	1902400	Did you pick up?
1902400	1904360	I think it's always a good thing when you travel to a...
1904360	1906200	I don't know if you're being serious or not.
1906200	1908120	Well, I just sort of like, what are you?
1908120	1909120	My mom?
1909120	1911040	Like, what is your problem?
1911040	1914240	You've been shitty to me since I sat down here.
1914240	1915880	I haven't seen you in weeks.
1915880	1918000	I come in, hey, how you doing?
1918000	1924440	You look at the floor, you don't say anything and you're just shitting on everything I do.
1924440	1931440	And I came out here because there's only six episodes left.
1931440	1932440	Five and a half.
1932440	1933440	I didn't have to.
1933440	1937920	I could have stayed home with Kate and Lolly and now you're, you're shitting on everything
1937920	1938920	I say.
1938920	1940880	What, what did I ever do, man?
1940880	1941880	You know, goddamn well.
1941880	1942880	No, I don't.
1942880	1944480	That's why I'm asking.
1944480	1948560	That you come here whenever you want and it's always when your dog and your wife kick you
1948560	1949560	out.
1949560	1950680	No, it's not true.
1950680	1953400	There's nobody waiting for you that you could have been with.
1953400	1954400	No, that's not true.
1954400	1955400	It was this or being under a bridge.
1955400	1956400	How would you know?
1956400	1958280	How would you know?
1958280	1959280	What is your talking problem?
1959280	1962080	Because I've known you for 20 years.
1962080	1963080	More than that.
1963080	1964080	Yeah.
1964080	1965960	So it's like...
1965960	1967440	So what, what, what?
1967440	1968440	30 years.
1968440	1971360	So I know what it's like to be your dog and Kate.
1972360	1973520	I do.
1973520	1976200	I can only imagine.
1976200	1979360	I know that every once in a while they're going to be like, why don't you go do the
1979360	1980360	Heart and Talk show?
1980360	1981760	No, don't even.
1981760	1983800	You don't even put words in Kate and Lolly.
1983800	1988400	And you have to pull like straws out of your lips and like fucking cotton swabs off your
1988400	1992320	eyebrows that you glued with toothpaste because you, you thought it would be funny in the
1992320	1995600	middle of Kate probably like trying to confide with you about something that was troubling
1995600	1999520	her at work and you're like, she said a word that rhymed with claws.
1999520	2006640	You're Santa Claus and you're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, like, and she's like, this is not
2006640	2010200	based on any true events at all.
2010200	2016680	This is completely made up and it's not true.
2016680	2022320	I've been doing toothpaste Santa Claus for 20 plus years.
2022320	2029120	I need, I need a new pet.
2029120	2031960	Does toothpaste work on cotton, cotton balls?
2031960	2032960	For glue.
2032960	2033960	Yeah.
2033960	2037000	So if you're strapped.
2037000	2039680	So that wasn't a riff that Dan actually knows that you do that.
2039680	2040680	Oh, yeah.
2040680	2042680	I've done it a couple of times.
2042680	2059000	I did it last Christmas, woke Kate up Christmas morning with a red shirt and white tape down
2060000	2070000	my cotton all over my face and two oven mitts and I'm like, oh, oh, Mary, Jesus Christ.
2070000	2077000	What is this minty fresh elf doing in here?
2080000	2082000	I thought that gave you joy.
2082000	2083000	I didn't realize it.
2083000	2084000	What was the first time?
2084000	2085000	Pissed you off.
2085000	2086000	Let's go down memory lane.
2086000	2089680	Do you guys remember the very first time you met and what the interaction was?
2089680	2090680	You and Schwab?
2090680	2091680	I remember.
2091680	2094040	Someone says I know it?
2094040	2095040	Someone knows.
2095040	2096040	You do?
2096040	2097040	No.
2097040	2098040	Okay.
2098040	2099040	That's fair.
2099040	2100040	What do you fucking know?
2100040	2104680	I remember the very first time I saw you two.
2104680	2113760	I noticed Schwab after a comedy sports workshop and he was wearing his fucking leather baseball
2113760	2130920	cap and his gray sweatshirt and we were having Vice beers with Bo Johnson after the workshop
2130920	2139800	and then Schwab was talking about he's eating Fritos and drinking beer and he said something
2139800	2146560	like, you know, they put riboflavin in these chips.
2146560	2148400	You guys hear this?
2148400	2150720	They put riboflavin.
2150720	2159600	It's a meat tenderizer and it makes you thirsty for some chemical in coke.
2159600	2168840	So if you eat Fritos, you get tenderized and then you want coke and then the coke makes
2168840	2172920	you want Fritos.
2172920	2173920	This is the first interaction?
2173920	2174920	That's the first time.
2174920	2183080	I was like, who the fuck is this?
2183080	2185440	Were you both on Milwaukee comedy sports at this time?
2185440	2186440	No.
2186440	2187440	We were students.
2187440	2188440	We were in high school.
2188440	2193360	We were aspiring, we were aspirants to that throne.
2193360	2195080	And you were not in high school?
2195080	2197000	Were you already on the squad, Rob?
2197000	2198000	No.
2198000	2200120	I was in workshops.
2200120	2202840	I was in my last year of college.
2202840	2206760	Had you both just moved to Milwaukee or were you still in Red Deer or Brown Deer?
2206760	2209120	That was like my fourth year in Milwaukee.
2209120	2217480	I was probably in between living with my parents in Brown Deer and living with McKenna on
2217480	2218800	the east side of Milwaukee.
2218800	2219800	Right.
2219800	2223240	Well, that's not true because I wouldn't be living with McKenna.
2223240	2226280	So I was probably just pretty much living with my parents and crashing on people's
2226280	2227280	couches in Milwaukee.
2227280	2230480	Did you and Rob connect that first day or did it take a while?
2230480	2233480	I think it took a while.
2233480	2236000	I think we're still trying to connect.
2236000	2239960	No, I think we connected.
2239960	2240960	We did all right.
2240960	2241960	Who cares?
2241960	2244480	There's a question for the ages.
2244480	2246640	Who cares?
2246640	2247640	Rob does.
2247640	2248640	I do.
2248640	2249640	You do too.
2249640	2251600	He pretends like he doesn't.
2251600	2253280	That's his shield.
2253280	2256440	How important is your friendship to Rob's job?
2256440	2257880	It's worth like a billion dollars.
2257880	2258880	See?
2258880	2259880	It's worth its weight in gold.
2259880	2263200	Wait, so you put it into financial terms.
2263200	2268240	When you see Rob, you see just a giant bag of cash.
2268240	2269240	No, no.
2269240	2274720	I said what's worth to him.
2274720	2276320	To you, like emotionally.
2276320	2281360	Oh, it's worth a thousand hugs.
2281360	2283160	Not a billion dollars, just a thousand hugs.
2283160	2285960	I don't see things through that lens.
2285960	2289360	What is the hug to dollar conversion?
2289360	2290360	Nine.
2290360	2293960	That's not bad.
2293960	2297360	You made Rob leave the stage.
2297360	2303000	It looks like he's floating a head, a floating head.
2303000	2305920	He's like a green screen guy.
2305920	2307160	Why that expression?
2307160	2308400	What's the expression?
2308400	2311680	He's shocked that his head is floating.
2311680	2317800	You're shocked to be a floating head.
2317800	2325560	Jeff's helping, quote unquote, handing him something to hold with his hands that aren't
2325560	2326560	supposed to be there.
2326560	2330800	Why did that help the illusion?
2330800	2332840	Put a sweater on him.
2332840	2336880	Yeah, we crop those out though.
2336880	2340640	I don't have anything to talk about anyway.
2340640	2347440	That's the thing.
2347440	2351520	Jeff's doing something behind the curtain.
2351520	2355240	That's why he had to be behind the curtain.
2355240	2359440	They shuffle back to their seats.
2359440	2360960	Someone really enjoyed that.
2360960	2367440	Was this big news here too, like 38 bodies found on a truck?
2367440	2368440	I heard that.
2368440	2374360	It was just all over the TVs everywhere we went because we were here.
2374360	2379440	I usually don't see TVs unless I'm in airports.
2379440	2381440	We kept debating.
2381440	2382880	Cody's like, what's a lorry?
2382880	2383880	It's a bus.
2383880	2389880	I was like, maybe it's a truck too, but it was like 38 bodies found on a lorry.
2389880	2396880	This is a great time for Rob to be making light of things.
2396880	2403680	Just a truck full of dead people.
2403680	2408760	Obviously a human trafficking thing, which I just say, of course human trafficking being
2408760	2411800	like a really horrible...
2411800	2414480	One of the worst atrocities in modern times.
2414480	2419320	Many lives claim like say every hour two women are...
2419320	2420320	There's probably...
2420320	2424880	Why are you applauding this?
2424880	2431400	Usually dealing with some of the most vulnerable segments of our population.
2431400	2436440	There's probably more slaves living today, active slaves, than there have been at any
2436440	2437760	point in history.
2437760	2441760	Oh, so now it's not funny.
2441760	2446520	Now that there's not a candle, no one cares.
2446520	2448600	Here's something I think you'll find interesting.
2448600	2449600	Okay?
2449600	2451240	Lay it on me.
2451240	2464320	We're driving from the Oslo airport to Frederikstad, and our driver, Audvar, we said to him, because
2464320	2468600	it's Halloween at the time, we were like, do you guys celebrate Halloween in Norway?
2468600	2476120	And he said, well, we actually just started recently, about two years ago.
2476120	2478560	How does that happen?
2479520	2481240	What kind of fucking...
2481240	2483760	Who was that?
2483760	2485360	Big Halloween just moved in.
2485360	2489200	Are there any foreign holidays that we could start doing?
2489200	2490200	Yeah, I know.
2490200	2491200	I didn't know...
2491200	2492880	You guys ever heard of Sweetest Day?
2492880	2493880	Yeah.
2493880	2494880	One...
2494880	2500560	The guy who knows how Dan Petrov knows about it.
2500560	2501560	Sweetest Day.
2501560	2502560	Sweetest Day.
2502560	2505880	Sweetest Day is a holiday that's celebrated in the Midwest.
2505880	2507280	I remember hearing about it.
2507280	2508280	It's just made up.
2508280	2509280	It's all these made up holidays.
2509280	2510280	I mean, it turns out...
2510280	2511280	They're all made up.
2511280	2512280	No, no.
2512280	2516240	Most of the holidays are natural laws passed down by the gods.
2516240	2518840	No, but it was just...
2518840	2520720	It's called Sweetest Day to sell candy.
2520720	2523480	It was conceived of by confectioners.
2523480	2525400	The first day is the sweetest.
2525400	2526400	Whoa.
2526400	2527400	Thank you.
2527400	2528400	That's...
2528400	2529400	Yeah.
2529400	2530400	I wrote down this note.
2530400	2531400	It was really sad.
2531400	2532400	I don't care if you don't laugh.
2532400	2533400	That was funny for me.
2533400	2534960	We got some for everybody.
2534960	2537200	I wrote down, why am I always losing everything?
2537200	2538680	Because I thought I left my...
2538680	2539680	Because I did leave.
2539680	2544480	I left my boarding pass on the connecting flight on the plane.
2544480	2545480	No big deal.
2545480	2546480	I was able to just get another one.
2546480	2547480	It's just a boarding pass.
2547480	2548520	Like, you're in the airport anyway.
2548520	2549520	But I was like...
2549520	2550520	I was like, God damn.
2550520	2553440	It's obviously something that I wouldn't choose to leave.
2553440	2554440	And I'm always doing that.
2554440	2557720	I'm always, like, leaving shit, no matter how important it is.
2557720	2563520	And then on the next flight, on the one to Oslo, I was convinced I couldn't find my airpods.
2563520	2564520	Earbuds?
2564520	2565520	What the fuck are they called?
2565520	2566520	Airpods.
2566520	2567520	Airpods?
2567520	2568520	Jesus Christ, Apple.
2568520	2569520	Get your shit together.
2569520	2571680	They're coming out with the AirPod Pro.
2571680	2572800	Oh, cool.
2572800	2581200	I hope I can use those with my iPad 7th generation non-pro with second type of Apple Pencil mini
2581200	2582200	air.
2582200	2583200	Fucking idiot.
2583200	2584200	What the fuck?
2584200	2585200	Steve Jobs' body isn't even cold.
2585200	2586200	I know.
2586200	2587200	It's a bummer.
2587200	2588200	They turned him to fucking Microsoft.
2588200	2589600	Fucking idiots.
2589600	2591440	That Tim Apple's fucking everything up.
2591440	2592440	You'd think...
2592440	2594960	Tim Apple.
2594960	2601880	You'd think with a name like that, he'd be ready for the job.
2601880	2608120	But I wrote this down, this very lugubrious, why am I always losing everything, and when
2608120	2616760	I look at it, I remember how I felt.
2616760	2617760	Keep going.
2617760	2618760	Keep going.
2618760	2621040	Do you want to talk about slavery real quick?
2621040	2622040	Sex trafficking.
2622040	2626680	I don't even like using the word pimp anymore, because the proper term is sex trafficker.
2626680	2629880	Is that right?
2629880	2631480	Yeah.
2631480	2634160	That's what pimp stands for.
2634160	2640440	No, but it's like a sanitized version of what's actually happening.
2640440	2645960	But I wrote down why am I always losing everything, because I was just...
2645960	2649080	The reason I wrote it down was because I was really genuinely in the throes of this sort
2649080	2653040	of tail spin, just because I lost this stupid Apple product.
2653040	2655440	And then it wasn't like that was valuable to me.
2655440	2657440	It was this idea of...
2657440	2658760	It's the ego hit.
2658760	2662640	It was the fact that I could lose my boarding pass and then have that be such a center
2662640	2663640	of attention.
2663640	2667160	I'm so absent-minded, I could leave my boarding pass in a plane, and then got on another plane
2667160	2672800	and then left something even more valuable in spite of having every incentive.
2672800	2676280	It sent me into such a depression, because I was like, what is my fucking problem?
2676280	2678760	Well, you also had a load of shit in your pants.
2678760	2679920	No, I didn't.
2679920	2681320	This was the trip out there.
2681320	2683480	That might have been a distracting factor.
2683480	2684920	No, this was the trip out there.
2684920	2690880	But then I found them in some pocket, and it was like, oh, okay, I didn't lose my AirPods.
2690880	2692040	Did you look in the pocket?
2692040	2694040	Shut up, just for a second.
2694040	2700400	I don't know, something seemed profound about that, because my mood was instantly lightened.
2700400	2705480	I was so depressed and so self-loathing, I was like, oh, you're such a piece of shit.
2705480	2711800	There's something so wrong with you, and then I was like, oh, I'm fine.
2711800	2713040	I don't even know what to call that.
2713040	2714640	Do you have too many pockets?
2714640	2715920	Maybe you have too many pockets.
2715920	2719920	That's not the issue, obviously.
2719920	2721440	There's something more we could be achieving here.
2721440	2723320	Let's audit your pockets, though.
2723320	2724320	What?
2724320	2727240	Let's audit his pockets, see how many we're working with.
2727240	2731640	The closest thing to me that you're talking about is when I break my phone, when I drop
2731640	2736280	my phone and shatter the screen, I feel so existentially destroyed.
2736280	2737800	It's like, what are you?
2737800	2738800	You can't have nice things.
2738800	2742440	Who the fuck do you think you are?
2742440	2743440	You know what?
2743440	2749640	I think when I dropped my phone and broke the screen, I think, oh, shit, I'm one of
2749640	2755000	those people now, right?
2755000	2759640	Every time I saw somebody with a broken screen, I'd be like, pfft.
2759640	2760640	Come on.
2760640	2761640	Care of your shit.
2761640	2762640	Exactly.
2762640	2775680	And then, crack, you got me again, God, hubris of man.
2775680	2780120	I was really appreciating all the iPhone 11 launch day memes.
2780120	2786160	People were exchanging a lot of animated gifs of, like, Apple about to press that button
2786160	2789120	that makes your iPhone 10 turn to shit or whatever.
2789120	2795280	And then there's, like, a guy, like, putting on lipstick in the mirror and going, mm-hmm.
2795280	2796280	It was a lot of fun.
2796280	2800080	It's good when we can all get on the same page after a decade of servitude to a corporation.
2800080	2801080	We're like, you know what?
2801080	2804320	I really do think they just push a button that makes, like, three generations of iPhone
2804320	2805320	back.
2805320	2806320	Everything just goes to shit.
2806320	2807320	Like, they've got to be doing something, right?
2807320	2808320	All right.
2808320	2809320	Never mind.
2809320	2810320	I don't understand the meme.
2810320	2811320	It doesn't matter.
2811320	2812320	It doesn't matter.
2812320	2815320	I'd like to understand the meme.
2815320	2817880	Well, it's just, like, it doesn't matter what the meme is.
2817880	2820800	A meme could be, like, a scene from fucking office space or something.
2820800	2821800	Who cares?
2821800	2824800	We've got to be, we've got to be.
2824800	2827760	What's the button?
2827760	2829440	It breaks all the phones.
2829440	2833960	We've got to be brainstorming in this Memoji space.
2833960	2839320	There's a lot of untapped, like, creative space on these Memojis that we haven't figured
2839320	2840320	out.
2840320	2842160	But, you know, we could be the first ones to get there.
2842160	2843160	What's a Memoji?
2843160	2848320	Memoji is the animoji of your face that's built with your facial features.
2848320	2851320	It's a combination of a bitmoji and the animoji.
2851320	2853240	I don't have that new of a phone.
2853240	2857000	It's a very new space that we're very excited about.
2857000	2858000	Yeah.
2858000	2862800	I saw, I've seen you in, like, in group text Spencer doing your cute little Spencer.
2862800	2864480	That's what I'm talking about.
2864480	2869020	That's a whole new breed of content that someone's going to do, like, oh, I could put my baby
2869020	2870020	up to this thing.
2870020	2873500	And she goes, poopy diaper, and it's an elephant saying, and oh, boy.
2873500	2877740	But if we figure out what that is and tap down market, people will be fucking, we'll
2877740	2880220	be enshrined in the halls of internet history.
2880220	2882140	We'll be the new Viners.
2882140	2885900	TikTok will pay deference to us.
2885900	2888900	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
2888900	2889900	That's the point.
2889900	2890980	We've got to stay current.
2890980	2891980	I don't.
2891980	2892980	Well, first you have to understand.
2892980	2896100	It was three days ago that someone told me what baby shark was, and I was like, what
2896100	2898860	the fuck is going on?
2898860	2900220	And now, like, I'm way...
2900220	2902540	Well, let me catch you up.
2902540	2904980	TikTok is a platform famous for paying deference.
2904980	2905980	Right?
2905980	2906980	Oh, yeah.
2906980	2909180	They're so reverent, those teens.
2909180	2912700	It's the deferential treatment that you get from TikTok is why you turn out for it.
2912700	2915020	Spencer, you text Jeff a lot?
2915020	2917060	Oh, I'm texting Jeff.
2917060	2918900	I'm texting Dan.
2918900	2921500	I'm texting Steve.
2921500	2924780	I'm texting Laura.
2924780	2927500	I'm texting Zach.
2927500	2933020	I'm texting Lolly, your dog.
2933020	2934020	So I bought this...
2934020	2937380	Lolly's got a phone?
2937380	2938380	I wrote one more...
2938380	2939380	She has an emoji.
2939380	2943580	I only got one more note in here, which is, I think it was because Dina was making me
2943580	2947700	think because I was talking about how scared I am that, like, I don't know.
2947700	2954140	Like I listened to so much true crime and then I like, I just feel like, you know, like
2954260	2963500	the Mark David Chapman, like, we're getting crazier and crazier and then our crazier people
2963500	2967260	are going to get crazier and all that stuff, but then Dina, always the contrarian, but
2967260	2972060	sometimes that's helpful when you're in a tailspin, it was like, I don't know, maybe
2972060	2975860	the internet's like a release for them.
2975860	2980260	Like, they don't have to like track you down and shoot you.
2980260	2984740	They can fucking go on your Instagram and call you a fucking idiot and, you know, like
2984740	2986220	feel like they did something.
2986220	2990140	That's an uplifting thought.
2990140	2991140	Yeah.
2991140	2994340	Because these are all people that could shoot me.
2994340	2995340	Right.
2995340	2996340	Yeah.
2996340	2998340	I should stop blocking them.
2998340	2999340	Yeah.
2999340	3002300	Because I'm cutting them off from...
3002300	3003300	Yeah.
3003300	3004900	I mean, I should delete my Instagram.
3004900	3005900	Or should I?
3005900	3006900	Or will that get me shot?
3006900	3007900	No.
3007900	3009980	What'll you broadcast your workouts on?
3010020	3013460	When you mute somebody on Instagram, when you mute somebody, do they know that they've
3013460	3014460	been muted?
3014460	3015460	Can they tell anybody?
3015460	3017260	I hope not.
3017260	3019060	When you mute someone on what?
3019060	3020060	Instagram.
3020060	3021060	On Instagram.
3021060	3022060	I don't know if there is...
3022060	3025060	So they don't post something and know that you don't give a fuck anymore.
3025060	3034060	If you screenshot someone's story, do they know?
3034060	3035580	That's an old Snapchat question, right?
3035580	3036580	Yeah.
3036580	3038500	But I knew the answer to Snapchat.
3038500	3039500	It's a fun question.
3040020	3045820	Spencer, of those three books to your right, which is your favorite book of those three
3045820	3046820	books?
3046820	3047820	Okay.
3047820	3054780	So for the folks at home, the three books are Burt's Italian English and English Italian
3054780	3055780	Dictionary.
3055780	3056780	All right.
3056780	3059620	Spencer, pick a title that speaks out to you, the one that you like the most.
3059620	3062580	Well, A Princess of Thule or Tool, maybe?
3062580	3063580	Okay.
3063580	3064580	Tool.
3064580	3065580	All right.
3065580	3066580	So take that one.
3066580	3067580	Now, put the other two down.
3067580	3068580	Oh, boy.
3068660	3071700	Can I interject with something kind of fascinating here?
3071700	3075700	Because there were three books, and he picked A Princess of Thule, which means that one
3075700	3079860	of those books, which is way thinner than the other, is either an Italian to English
3079860	3083260	or an English to Italian, and one's way thicker.
3083260	3084260	Right.
3084260	3088180	I'm just wondering which language is pitching and which is catching here.
3088180	3092860	No, the other book is Gallery Buffet Soup Cookbook.
3092860	3093860	Okay.
3093860	3094860	Oh, all right.
3094860	3095860	You picked what?
3095860	3096860	The Princess of Thule?
3096860	3097860	Yeah.
3097860	3099980	What skills do these three books have?
3099980	3100980	Okay.
3100980	3103060	I'm realizing that one of these books is just both.
3103060	3105060	The dictionary is both ways.
3105060	3106060	Oh, okay.
3106060	3110300	Here's something my friend Jenny Mack from Texas taught me.
3110300	3111300	Oh, I met her.
3111300	3112300	Oh, yeah.
3112300	3113300	You met Jenny.
3113300	3114300	I met her there.
3114300	3115620	You met her in Austin.
3115620	3116620	I know something.
3116620	3117620	All right.
3117620	3120140	Now, you have this book.
3120140	3124100	Ask yourself kind of a philosophical question about yourself, like, not like-
3124100	3125100	Oh, boy.
3125100	3128780	Ask yourself something about you, your future, your life, what you want, what you don't want,
3128780	3130460	what you want to know about yourself.
3130460	3132300	Ask yourself that question, but don't tell anybody.
3132300	3133300	Yeah, I did.
3133300	3134300	Okay, you got it.
3134300	3137540	How many pages are in this book, Spencer?
3137540	3139540	Oh, boy.
3139540	3140540	462.
3140540	3141540	Okay.
3141540	3145900	Pick a number between 10 and 460, and you pick that number first.
3145900	3146900	Me personally?
3146900	3147900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3147900	3148900	You pick the number.
3148900	3149900	Okay.
3149900	3150900	You got it?
3150900	3151900	No.
3151900	3152900	I got it.
3152900	3153900	Okay.
3153900	3154900	Now- It's 69.
3155900	3156900	You know, it's funny.
3156900	3157900	It's that one.
3157900	3162420	Because that's when people are like, are doing things.
3162420	3163420	Yeah.
3163420	3164420	Okay.
3164420	3165420	At the same time, though, that's why it's funny.
3165420	3166420	Yeah.
3166420	3167420	Ideally-
3167420	3172020	If one person's doing it to the other person, that's serious shit.
3172020	3173020	Nobody wins.
3173020	3174020	This guy's eating my pussy.
3174020	3175420	Okay, so you've chosen-
3175420	3177780	Or I'm sucking this guy's dick.
3177780	3178780	No, I think it's different.
3178780	3183420	But at the same time, woo-hoo!
3183420	3186060	So you've chosen page 69 out of the princess of-
3186060	3187780	No, I speak to a different number.
3187780	3188780	Okay, what is it?
3188780	3189780	130.
3189780	3190780	130.
3190780	3195540	Now, let's say- How many lines of print are in each page?
3195540	3196540	Dialogue.
3196540	3199580	Let's pick it up between one and 30.
3199580	3201780	Gay.
3201780	3204060	I said gay, which is politically correct.
3204060	3206020	A lot of- I thought you said gay.
3206020	3207660	I think a lot of people might have.
3207660	3211460	You just blurted it out after five years of being woke.
3211460	3212460	It just erupted.
3213460	3215460	I'm like, women shouldn't vote.
3215460	3219940	And let's be honest, maybe I said that.
3219940	3220940	But that wasn't the intent.
3220940	3221940	Well, all right.
3221940	3225460	A, B, C, D, E, F, J, K. Is that eight?
3225460	3226580	No, no, no.
3226580	3228100	The number I picked was 15.
3228100	3229100	15, okay.
3229100	3231300	Now, go to page 130, you said?
3231300	3232300	Yep.
3232300	3233300	We're almost-
3233300	3234940	You have the question in your mind, right?
3234940	3235940	You asked yourself.
3235940	3236940	Yes.
3236940	3239020	Now, go to that page.
3239020	3242620	That line on that page is going to be the answer to that question.
3242620	3244460	I don't know if it's the one I want, though.
3244460	3246900	Well, it's not up to you anymore, baby.
3246900	3247900	It's up to-
3247900	3248900	Yeah, I mean-
3248900	3250620	William, you lady.
3250620	3251620	Okay.
3251620	3253740	So page 130, line what?
3253740	3255260	15 is what I said.
3255260	3256260	Line 15.
3256260	3257260	Okay.
3257260	3259900	Read the line out and then-
3259900	3260900	Phil.
3260900	3261900	Phil.
3261900	3262900	Time.
3262900	3263900	While I count the numbers.
3263900	3264900	Oh, oh, oh, Phil, okay.
3264900	3267900	Sorry, I could have done a lot better job communicating.
3268420	3270060	It's like you're reading a video.
3270060	3271060	No, no, sorry.
3271060	3272060	I'm so sorry.
3272060	3277300	Everybody, this is how fancy counts the lines.
3277300	3279740	This is a song for that segment.
3279740	3280740	Dad.
3280740	3281740	14, 15.
3281740	3282740	Shush.
3282740	3283740	No, that's what I wanted.
3283740	3285940	Wait, wait, what was the line?
3285940	3288780	Is it a sentence or is it just a line of the page?
3288780	3290860	Because, you know, a sentence can go multiple lines.
3290860	3295860	Yeah, but read like a part of that sentence or whatever like jumps out at you.
3295860	3296860	Okay.
3296860	3300820	The evening too, when they had climbed to the top of the hills and the south of Stornaway
3300820	3306100	Harbor, did not the little town look sufficiently picturesque with its white houses, its shipping,
3306100	3310340	its castle and plantation lying in shadow under the green of the eastern sky, then away
3310340	3311340	to the west.
3311340	3313580	What a strange picture presented itself.
3313580	3316980	Thick bands of gray cloud lay across the sky.
3316980	3319500	So you kind of get the idea.
3319500	3326860	But now, what was the question?
3326860	3327860	What was your question?
3327860	3333380	Uh, I don't want to say, but should I move to Portland?
3333380	3340700	Yeah, it definitely wasn't a clear answer.
3340700	3345540	Maybe it means Dan, pick a book, pick a book, Dan, I got six for you now that it's a tried
3345540	3346540	and true parlor game.
3346540	3348860	I mean, do you want this one or several rounds?
3348860	3353900	Give me a small, there are six books on top.
3353900	3354900	Is that the Italian?
3354900	3357060	No, these ones we didn't even name off.
3357060	3358060	Okay.
3358060	3360060	Where's that book called, Dan?
3360060	3364540	Well, this is what it might be fucked up.
3364540	3370260	This looks like a bunch of French or Latin or it says La Morte.
3370260	3375060	Find a book that appeals to you by Sir Thomas Mallory.
3375060	3376060	Hell yeah.
3376060	3377060	I know that guy.
3377420	3378900	Mallory never lets you do it.
3378900	3381140	So what's the first instruction?
3381140	3386820	You ask yourself a philosophical question that you want to have the answer to.
3386820	3387820	Okay.
3387820	3389220	But don't reveal it to us yet.
3389220	3390220	Right.
3390220	3391220	Well, let me think about this for a second.
3391220	3392220	Yeah, pick a goodie.
3392220	3393220	It's kind of like Karnak.
3393220	3394620	Can someone fill time?
3394620	3397860	Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
3397860	3399860	I'm the scat man.
3400860	3403860	Skimmy, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
3403860	3408860	Hey, I saw, Dolomite is my name.
3408860	3410860	Oh, it's really fucking good.
3410860	3411860	It's great.
3411860	3415860	Say people wrote, Edward wrote the Dolomite biopic.
3415860	3417860	Do you think they did better?
3417860	3419860	Not a biopic, but kind of like his up and coming.
3419860	3420860	What'd they do?
3420860	3421860	Was that better than Edward?
3421860	3423860	Well, I think Edward is like a perfect movie.
3423860	3425860	This one's quite good though.
3425860	3427860	I thought Eddie Murphy did a great job.
3427860	3430860	But Wesley Snipes was the fucking shit.
3430860	3431860	OK.
3431860	3432860	I got my philosophical question.
3432860	3433860	Best part of the movie.
3433860	3434860	OK.
3434860	3435860	OK.
3435860	3436860	Good job, Rob.
3436860	3437860	Filling time.
3437860	3438860	Dan has his philosophical question,
3438860	3440860	and the book is titled what, Dan?
3440860	3441860	Little more.
3441860	3442860	Let me see if it's on the inside cover,
3442860	3445860	because it's very hard to read.
3445860	3446860	Fuck.
3446860	3448860	Hold on.
3448860	3452860	Every man's library, edited by Ernest Ries.
3452860	3453860	No, no.
3453860	3454860	That might be the collection.
3454860	3455860	OK.
3455860	3459860	La Morte D'Arthur, The Death of Arthur, I assume that is.
3459860	3460860	La Morte D'Arthur.
3460860	3461860	Yeah.
3461860	3462860	Arthur's death.
3462860	3465860	With an introduction by Professor Ries in two volumes, volume one.
3465860	3466860	This sounds good.
3466860	3467860	OK.
3467860	3470860	I knew what they were doing back then.
3470860	3471860	Come on.
3471860	3474860	Let's just call it Skyfall.
3474860	3477860	So pick a page in between, like any page number.
3477860	3479860	I don't know how long that book is.
3479860	3480860	OK.
3480860	3481860	Wait.
3481860	3482860	Sorry.
3482860	3483860	I'm sorry.
3483860	3486860	It's a page number that falls within the beginning and the end of that book.
3486860	3489860	So do I flip to the page and just stick a finger in it?
3489860	3490860	No, no.
3490860	3491860	Think of a number.
3491860	3492860	OK.
3492860	3493860	Let me look at how many pages.
3493860	3497860	It looks like 401, so I pick a number between...
3497860	3498860	10.
3498860	3500860	So it's not your intro or whatever.
3500860	3501860	OK.
3501860	3502860	So I'll go with...
3502860	3503860	OK.
3503860	3504860	I got it.
3504860	3505860	You got it.
3505860	3506860	What number?
3506860	3507860	69.
3507860	3508860	It's funny.
3508860	3509860	It's fucking funny.
3509860	3510860	Now pick a number between...
3510860	3511860	It's funny.
3511860	3515860	Between one and, let's say, 24, because I think that's how many...
3515860	3516860	Like, let's...
3516860	3518860	Ish, you know, the number of lines on the page.
3518860	3519860	It's like a sonnet.
3519860	3520860	OK.
3520860	3521860	Pick a number between one and 24.
3521860	3522860	Ah, 10.
3522860	3523860	OK.
3523860	3524860	10.
3524860	3525860	So what page number?
3525860	3526860	69.
3526860	3527860	69.
3527860	3528860	Line 10.
3528860	3529860	OK.
3529860	3530860	Now I want you to read us...
3530860	3531860	Go to that page.
3531860	3532860	OK.
3532860	3533860	Read us that line.
3533860	3535860	And you have the question still in your head, correct?
3535860	3536860	Yup, yup, yup.
3536860	3537860	OK.
3537860	3538860	This is going to blow everybody's mind.
3538860	3539860	Wow.
3539860	3541500	Spencer's was not so good.
3541500	3544500	I think if we went with 69, it would have been a lot better.
3544500	3545500	Let's go back to that after that.
3545500	3546500	OK.
3546500	3547500	Wait, but did you ever tell us what your question was?
3547500	3548500	No, I didn't.
3548500	3549500	I was embarrassed.
3549500	3550500	Oh, OK.
3550500	3557420	I mean, yeah, in your defense, I knew from watching you that I needed to pick...
3557420	3560500	I have philosophical questions that I don't want to share.
3560500	3561500	Right.
3561500	3562740	And so I picked one that was worth sharing.
3562740	3567060	Well, I'm glad to be, you know, take that bullet for you.
3567060	3568060	That's cool.
3568060	3569060	OK.
3569060	3570060	All right.
3570060	3571060	69.
3571060	3575900	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
3575900	3576900	Let's give it up.
3576900	3579180	Read that line, like, all the way through.
3579180	3580180	OK.
3580180	3581180	Well, it's kind of...
3581180	3582180	It's in the middle of a...
3582180	3583180	Yeah, that's what I had.
3583180	3585300	Then use the whole sentence.
3585300	3586300	OK.
3586300	3597100	So, Balon prayed the lady of her gentleness for his true service that she would bury them
3597100	3601180	both in that same place where the battle was done.
3601180	3605660	I think that was my answer.
3605660	3607780	So now can you say the question?
3607780	3615060	My question was, should I give death weight in my life?
3615060	3616060	Whoa.
3616060	3617060	Now read the question.
3617060	3618060	And then you got buried.
3618060	3619060	Read the line again.
3619060	3621860	I did get a death-related sentence.
3621860	3622860	So Balon...
3622860	3625860	This is some proper name, I'm sure.
3625860	3628140	That's a dwarf, I think.
3628140	3629860	Sounds like it, yeah.
3629860	3631220	Prayed and not...
3631220	3635220	It's prayed, like, hands together, like, talking to God.
3635220	3641620	So Balon prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, which means...
3641620	3644620	So he prayed the lady of her gentleness.
3644620	3649380	Maybe that's a type of standardized prayer, maybe.
3649380	3650380	Say what?
3650380	3651380	He sought it from her.
3651380	3652380	He sought it from her.
3652380	3653380	Sought it from her.
3653380	3658540	You sound like you have an accent that means that you actually are credible in that.
3658540	3663620	Or are you just a foreign guy that's like, oh, no praying, you could pray on someone.
3663620	3665060	We actually have...
3665060	3669460	We actually have Mallory right here.
3669460	3671300	Prayed the lady of her gentleness.
3671300	3672300	Is that a way to you?
3672300	3673300	I'm looking...
3673300	3675100	Oh, he begged her for gentleness, maybe?
3675100	3677180	Can you pray someone of...
3677180	3680260	Would that be, like, beseeching them of their...
3680260	3681260	Beseeching their gentleness?
3681260	3682260	Yeah, more or less, it sounds like.
3682260	3684780	They're asking with soliciting it.
3684780	3694500	So Balon prayed the lady of her gentleness, comma, for his true service, comma, that she
3694500	3700620	would bury them both in that same place where the battle was done.
3700620	3701620	So 9-11.
3701620	3702620	9-11.
3702620	3703620	Thessalonians 9-11.
3703620	3704620	Oh, fuck, it is 9-11.
3704620	3705620	It actually is 9-11.
3705620	3710460	But I could interpret that to mean, like...
3710460	3711460	Way to go, Mallory.
3712340	3714660	You know the phrase, don't shit where you eat?
3714660	3715660	Yeah.
3715660	3723460	Like, you know, this is a character that is asking someone to bury him and someone else
3723460	3727560	that's important to him in the same place where they battled.
3727560	3732660	So the answer to my philosophical question would be, well, fuck, yeah, give death weight
3732660	3734160	in your life.
3734160	3735660	That's what life is.
3735660	3738860	Like, yeah, like, pick out your...
3738860	3739860	Pick out your...
3739860	3740860	Be ready for it.
3740860	3741860	It's a military plot.
3741860	3744020	Like, while you're alive, put your estate in order.
3744020	3745540	Write your will.
3745540	3746540	Pick your funeral plot.
3746540	3747540	Like, it's not...
3747540	3749980	That's not living outside the moment.
3749980	3755660	That's praying to the goddess to bury you where the battle was fought, you know?
3755660	3760220	Put me right here when I drop unexpectedly.
3760220	3762860	So the answer is, yes, like, give weight to it.
3762860	3766620	Give it the amount of weight that it deserves, which is like, hey, we were all here fighting
3766620	3769340	it together and bury me on the battlefield.
3769340	3776860	Don't bury me on the golf course.
3776860	3778460	Does anybody here have a novel on them?
3778460	3780460	Is anybody here carrying a book that's like fiction?
3780460	3781460	I got five.
3781460	3782460	You raising your hand?
3782460	3783460	Yeah.
3783460	3784460	Could we grab it?
3784460	3785460	This is for you, Rob.
3785460	3786540	I don't want to play.
3786540	3787540	You gotta...
3787540	3789820	I want to be buried on this stage.
3789820	3790820	I don't want to play.
3790820	3797980	Rob, you don't have to be afraid the president can't read.
3797980	3799660	It's fine now.
3799660	3802500	Rob, I'll do all the work for you.
3802500	3803500	This is a book.
3803500	3804500	What's your name, sir?
3804500	3805500	Zach Butcher.
3805500	3806500	Zach Butcher.
3806500	3813900	That is a guy, and I agree with him, that loves his name.
3813900	3816620	Because I always say Jeff when someone asks me my name.
3816620	3821460	But if my full name was Zach Butcher, I would never just say Zach.
3821460	3822460	Yeah.
3822460	3823460	That's for sure, yeah.
3823460	3824460	Okay.
3824460	3826820	That's a guy named Chad Huge Dick.
3826820	3830700	No, no, no, Chad Huge Dick is right.
3830700	3831700	Chad Scientist.
3831700	3835620	Because he'd be like, Chad, wait for it.
3835620	3840900	Okay, Rob, I'll do all the heavy lifting, Rob.
3840900	3843500	All you have to do is ask yourself a philosophical question.
3843500	3844500	I don't have any.
3844500	3849020	It could be about you or Dan or me or anybody else.
3849020	3850020	I don't have any.
3850020	3851020	Yeah, you do.
3851020	3852020	Yes, she fucking do.
3852020	3853020	Yeah, you do.
3853020	3854020	Okay, what is it?
3854020	3855020	Directing.
3855020	3856020	I don't really.
3856020	3857020	I don't.
3857020	3858020	Rob, ask.
3858020	3859020	I don't know.
3859020	3860020	I don't know.
3860020	3861020	You do.
3861020	3862020	I don't want to be forced to play this.
3862020	3863020	I've been thinking just a minute.
3863020	3864020	Oh, brother.
3864020	3865020	You love games.
3865020	3866020	No, I don't.
3866020	3867020	This guy loves games.
3867020	3872020	I would never ask to be a part of this, and now I'm ruining the show.
3872020	3875020	It's not a game if you can't lose.
3875020	3876020	Oh, he can lose.
3876020	3877900	I just want to watch.
3877900	3879300	I don't want to be.
3879300	3880820	Why do I have to do it?
3880820	3882340	Well, just do a question.
3882340	3883340	You don't have to do it, Rob.
3883340	3887380	So if I say you pick a color, you won't pick a color, because if someone's making you
3887380	3888380	do something.
3888380	3891820	It's like a game, right?
3891820	3893540	You won't pick a color.
3893540	3900220	Because it's always men on stage, who's a woman here that wants a question answered
3900220	3901220	in her life.
3901220	3902220	That's better.
3902220	3903220	That's so much better.
3903220	3904220	Right here.
3904220	3905220	What's your name?
3905220	3906220	Really?
3906220	3907220	Alicia.
3907220	3908220	Welcome Alicia to the stage.
3908220	3911220	Alicia, come on up here.
3912220	3915500	Hello, Alicia.
3915500	3916500	Grab a seat.
3916500	3919100	All right, Alicia, are you ready to play this game?
3919100	3920100	I'm ready.
3920100	3921100	Okay, here's the deal.
3921100	3922100	Hello.
3922100	3923100	Hi.
3923100	3926020	Wasn't it nice that you were asked if you wanted to play this game?
3926020	3927460	That was pretty respectful.
3927460	3928460	No.
3928460	3929460	Pretty respectful.
3929460	3931460	For being forced on spotlight.
3931460	3935340	God damn, the fucking Prime Minister of Respect.
3935340	3936340	Did you see this guy?
3936340	3937580	He's got the robe.
3937580	3939460	Did you see the movie, Alicia?
3940460	3942460	Oh, with Matt Damon?
3942460	3943460	Yeah.
3943460	3944460	No.
3944460	3945460	Okay, it was bad.
3945460	3946460	Was it Alicia?
3946460	3947460	No.
3947460	3948460	Yeah.
3948460	3949460	Oh, Alicia.
3949460	3950460	No.
3950460	3951460	No.
3951460	3952460	It's Alicia.
3952460	3955460	All right, Alicia.
3955460	3957660	See?
3957660	3962100	You raised your hand because you want some sort of philosophical question answered in
3962100	3963100	your life.
3963100	3964100	I'm seeking wisdom.
3964100	3965100	That's what you're not hoping.
3965100	3966100	Okay.
3966100	3967780	That microphone might not be on.
3967780	3972060	Let's turn this mic on with some applause.
3972060	3973060	Hello.
3973060	3976820	There you go.
3976820	3977820	It's the applause.
3977820	3978820	What did it?
3978820	3979820	You got to eat that mic.
3979820	3980820	You got to eat it like this.
3980820	3981820	There you are.
3981820	3982820	She was eating it plenty, but it wasn't on.
3982820	3983820	Okay.
3983820	3984820	Alicia.
3984820	3986380	This could be like a game show.
3986380	3990580	Do you have the question ready in your mind or do you want to think about it for a moment?
3990580	3991580	I'm ready.
3991580	3992580	You got it.
3992580	3993580	I'm ready.
3993580	3994580	All right.
3994580	3995580	Keep it to yourself for a second.
3995580	4003420	Zach Butcher gave us, and it is by the author Dan Simmons, and it's called The Rise of Endymion,
4003420	4005020	if I'm saying that correctly.
4005020	4006020	Sure.
4006020	4010860	I'm almost certain that Woot was by one Zach Butcher.
4010860	4011860	Someone fucking loves Endymion.
4011860	4012860	I don't know if it was.
4012860	4013860	I really don't know.
4013860	4014860	It wasn't.
4014860	4016860	Was it Zach Butcher or no?
4016860	4017860	No.
4017860	4018860	Okay.
4018860	4025060	This book goes all the way to let's call it 708 pages and starts around page five.
4025060	4029580	So between five and 708, pick a number.
4029580	4030580	You got it?
4030580	4031580	Got it.
4031580	4035220	And now, tell me the number.
4035220	4036220	We'll go 666.
4036220	4037220	Oh, dang.
4037220	4038220	It's almost Halloween.
4038220	4039220	That's funny too.
4039220	4040220	Yeah.
4040220	4041220	Yeah.
4041220	4042220	That's like the 69 of the occult.
4042220	4043220	Hell yeah.
4043220	4044220	That's accurate, Dan.
4044220	4053220	That's like if the devil was eating a leprechaun's pussy while the leprechaun fucking ate his ass.
4053220	4054220	A goblin.
4054900	4055900	That's what it means.
4055900	4056900	It's fun.
4056900	4058900	And if they did it on 420?
4058900	4059900	Yep.
4059900	4060900	The hijinks.
4060900	4064580	So from the rise of Endymion, am I saying that correctly, Zach Butcher?
4064580	4065580	Endymion.
4065580	4068780	There's got to be at least 30 lines or more.
4068780	4071940	Pick a line in the page.
4071940	4072940	27.
4072940	4073940	Oh.
4073940	4078740	That's going to take a while to get there.
4078740	4084660	Somebody says that the scat man stutters but doesn't ever stutter when he sings.
4084660	4088820	Watching it out, I'm going to tell you the stutter in the scat is the same for you.
4088820	4091980	I'm the scat man.
4091980	4094180	I'm the scat man.
4094180	4100180	I used to love the scat man.
4100180	4101180	Okay.
4101180	4102180	So Alicia.
4102180	4103180	Yes, Jeff.
4103180	4104180	Is it A-L-I-C-I-A?
4104180	4105180	E-L-Y-S-I-A.
4105180	4106180	Like the movie.
4106180	4107180	Like the Elysium.
4108180	4109180	That is correct.
4109180	4110180	Oh, Elysium.
4110180	4111180	Well, from Endymion.
4111180	4112180	Here we go.
4112180	4113180	Show me that text.
4113180	4114180	You have a question in your mind.
4114180	4115180	I have my question.
4115180	4122180	You chose in line 27, page 666 from Dan Simmons, The Rise of Endymions.
4122180	4124940	Whoo.
4124940	4128340	And then it goes like this, Rob.
4128340	4133260	And then I remembered that the one reason to be free, the one person who would make
4133260	4137260	such freedom worthwhile was gone.
4137260	4138260	Shit.
4138260	4140260	Holy shit.
4140260	4143860	Holy shit.
4143860	4146740	And the question was?
4146740	4151700	Should we relocate our life from California to another part of the country?
4151700	4153380	And you would because it was gone, right?
4153380	4155580	It was gone to the other side of the country.
4155580	4158660	It kind of sounds like I'm alone if I do this.
4158660	4159660	Yeah.
4159660	4160660	Right.
4160660	4161660	That's true.
4161660	4162660	But the one reason to be free.
4162660	4163660	That's freedom worthwhile.
4163660	4164660	My husband.
4164660	4165660	Oh, shit.
4165660	4166660	Oh, no.
4166660	4170300	We just killed your husband.
4170300	4171300	That's the albino you knew.
4171300	4172900	Is your husband the famous albino?
4172900	4173900	Yeah.
4173900	4177300	But we're not leaving her going home anti-handed.
4177300	4179780	Well, you could interpret it as a...
4179780	4180780	Alicia.
4180780	4181780	You get this novel.
4181780	4188260	It's like you get Zack Butcher's copy of Dan Simmons, The Rise of Endymion.
4188260	4190700	Thank you, Zack Butcher.
4190700	4192100	Along with two ice cubes.
4192100	4194620	Sorry, Zack.
4194620	4196020	She's got your fucking book now.
4196020	4197020	No, they're not.
4197020	4198020	They're actually quite comfortable.
4198020	4199020	It takes a while.
4199020	4200020	Thank you, Alicia.
4200020	4201020	Let's give it up for Alicia.
4201020	4204020	Thank you so much, madam.
4204020	4209140	If I was thinking about whether to change locations with my partner and then that was
4209140	4214860	the answer, as cloudy as it is, I would focus on the idea that what that passage is saying
4214860	4227220	is as unsatisfying as the answer might be, relocate or don't, just stick with this person.
4227220	4235820	Just make sure it's what you both want to do because as long as you're with him, you
4235820	4237340	can't pick a wrong place.
4237340	4238340	Thank you.
4238340	4239340	Right.
4239340	4240340	Oh, yeah.
4241340	4245340	Unless it's a very sunny place because he'll get skin cancer.
4251340	4253340	Hell yeah.
4253340	4256340	More like the walk of fame, you know what I'm saying?
4256340	4257340	Hell yeah.
4257340	4261860	I had a dream the other night where I kept pulling pine needles and pine branches out
4261860	4262860	of my mouth.
4262860	4265700	Like I ate a fucking Christmas tree.
4265700	4269300	And then last night I had a dream where I kept pulling glass shards out of my mouth.
4269300	4272700	Like my teeth were punched crystals.
4272700	4274300	I had a dream last night.
4274300	4276180	I was going to the bathroom.
4276180	4283660	I was peeing, standing up, and there were like bullet holes in the toilet.
4283660	4286860	I was like, what are all these bullet holes doing in the toilet?
4286860	4289540	And a guy came in and shot me.
4289540	4295300	And as I was dying in the dream, I said, why didn't I just jump out the window?
4296300	4300300	And I woke up.
4300300	4308060	I just remembered a crazy dream I had on one of the flights, which was, yeah, it was a
4308060	4313180	fucking insane, like super vivid, weird.
4313180	4320100	There were these dolls I was trying to like construct.
4320100	4331540	And when they were completed, they would generate these portals out of their face that
4331540	4338260	were like these hula hoops in space that would like come out of their mouths and then get
4338260	4341020	like it would be in space in front of them.
4341020	4346980	And if you put your head through the hula hoop, you were like in a different world.
4346980	4348740	And it was really freaky.
4348740	4355780	And I started to realize all too late that the dolls were part of some race of like things
4355780	4361660	that wanted me to finish the dolls so that they could take over and like some kind of
4361660	4363740	thing about like a gateway to-
4363740	4365060	Break a Morty season five.
4365060	4369940	I just remember like running from them with Cody.
4369940	4374860	And then there was like these guys that were like agents of these dolls or something.
4374860	4375860	That's so fucking cool.
4375860	4381220	When you dream a lot, is Cody usually there?
4381220	4384060	Cody's in my dreams a lot, but I really typically do not.
4384060	4388020	I mean, when people say you dream for sure every night, but then there's a question of
4388020	4389780	what you remember.
4389780	4394580	But let's just say if remembering your dreams is what we call dreaming.
4394580	4397860	I really don't have, I don't really don't dream a lot.
4397860	4402340	But when I do, I have like these super vivid dreams I shared on this podcast, like this
4402340	4408740	crazy dream I had that was like where it was like literally dreaming within dreaming
4408740	4411420	and like in the dream waking up.
4411420	4416780	And then I talked about that here and it was in a different house, but it was also a new
4416780	4419540	house that I was sharing with Cody that was also unfurnished.
4419540	4423660	And then like in the dream, like the scary shit happened because I heard a noise and
4423660	4424660	walked out of there.
4424660	4425660	Some scary shit happened.
4425660	4431380	And then in the dream, which I did not know was a dream, I fucking woke up in bed with
4431380	4439260	Cody in a new house and was like, just like in the movies when they do these missly dreams
4439260	4442500	where it was like, Cody was like, are you all right?
4442500	4444780	And I was like, yeah, I just had this crazy nightmare.
4444780	4446260	Talk to her about it.
4446260	4452020	Started laying back down, heard a noise and walked and explored it and then fucking woke
4452020	4459580	up in what I assume is real life, but now can never really know.
4459580	4463980	Like, it may as well not be because what are the rules here?
4463980	4466020	Like this could be a fucking dream.
4466020	4467620	Do your dogs ever dream?
4467620	4469220	Do you ever catch your dogs dreaming?
4469220	4470220	Oh, yeah.
4470220	4479220	Nigel is like, Nigel does not sleep without at some point going, you just like, I always
4479220	4485100	like touring between like, I can't, you look at a dog, they sound distressed when they're
4485100	4486500	making noises in their sleep.
4486500	4489660	But then again, you're kind of like, how would you know if a dog was having the time
4489660	4495580	of their life in a dream, because my instinct is like, let them know it's okay, wake them
4495580	4499500	up like, hey, it's all right, because you assume that they're like running from something
4499500	4500500	in their dream.
4500500	4501700	But what if they're like chasing something?
4501700	4504220	Those are the two modes of dog, right?
4504220	4508460	Like, you don't want to take that away from them if they're like about to catch an ostrich
4508460	4513940	with a fire hydrant for a head or whatever, Gary Larson.
4513940	4514940	Yeah.
4514940	4515940	What do they dream about?
4516260	4518100	Like, taking a nap?
4518100	4519620	I mean, what do they do all day?
4520620	4525700	I remember that Gary Larson cartoon where the dog, the dog is dreaming and the dog is
4525700	4531860	on top of an overturned car, and he's like howling in victory, he caught a car.
4531860	4538340	And then the in the in the natural in that Gary Larson book, the the far side natural
4538340	4542700	history book, like he goes into all this detail about how like, there's a whole section about
4542700	4545900	like, times his cartoons that caused an uproar.
4545900	4550980	And that that was one of them, because the dog, the way he drew it, there's just a certain
4550980	4556060	percentage of people saw that cartoon and thought the dog was fucking the car.
4556060	4562380	And it's like, it's just like, I mean, there's a part of the car that, like, I guess is like
4562380	4568340	tangential to the dog's pelvis, like, but it's like, why would the car have a vagina?
4569180	4569900	Why would I?
4569900	4570740	Why did they?
4570740	4576260	Why would they think that the dog that the reason dogs chase cars and why would they think
4576260	4584340	they were those people woke up in a world where, lest they're vigilant enough, the guy
4584340	4589340	who created the far side might just every once in a while on Sunday morning, treat your
4589340	4593300	family to an image of a dog fucking a car.
4593300	4600420	Like, unless you, like, Joe Q. Citizen, like, are on your shit with your pen ready to go
4600420	4603780	and your stamps ready to lick, like, to the local paper.
4603780	4605740	Do you remember the beef that he got?
4605740	4607060	Remember cow tools?
4607060	4614860	There was a cow with like, like, with like, like a blacksmith's apron on and a cow standing
4614860	4620300	upright on two legs and it was standing in front of like a table and there was this really
4620300	4625620	weird kind of oblong misshapen, like, you don't know what they are and it's just like
4625620	4629500	four or three things and it said cow tools.
4629500	4632980	And people were all fucked off about that because they didn't get it.
4632980	4633980	They didn't like it.
4633980	4634980	They were mad about it.
4634980	4636980	And he had to write a retraction.
4636980	4639220	Cows don't make good tools.
4639220	4642820	But didn't they think like they were like dildos and stuff or something?
4642820	4645020	People, it was inflammatory.
4645020	4646020	It was really good.
4646020	4647020	It's funny.
4647060	4652060	Dumb people, they live in this world, like this beautiful world where like they're the
4652060	4657460	only smart ones and they're the only ones that care.
4657460	4658460	But it's the opposite.
4658460	4660900	They're the only ones that don't care and they don't know anything.
4660900	4662140	So they really get on the freeway.
4662140	4667380	They're just like, and everyone's like, and they're like, you idiots.
4667380	4669380	And then they just see something that offends them.
4669380	4672580	If they don't get the joke and they're like, instead of saying, I don't get it, they're
4672580	4675380	just like, that's a terrible joke.
4675380	4676380	What do you mean?
4677380	4681980	I really feel like the hate mail that Gary Larson got for Cow Tools was like people
4681980	4684500	thought that they took personal offense to it.
4684500	4688340	I don't know what that's based on because it's just a drawing of something that looks
4688340	4691460	like kind of like a baby's rattle with a little thing on it.
4691460	4693860	Yeah, it just like it's really.
4693860	4694860	I just looked at it.
4694860	4696540	It was really good.
4696540	4701780	There's like a saw that looks like it's made out of bread or something.
4701780	4702780	It's the funniest joke.
4702780	4703780	It's really funny.
4704580	4711140	I love bad jokes, but there's certain jokes that you can only tell people that like anti-humor.
4711140	4714540	And that's a really anti-joke joke.
4714540	4716660	Like the guy who's half his head's a pumpkin.
4716660	4721860	That's a joke that people only laugh at if you like comedy and also know that the rules
4721860	4724220	can be broken for the sake of comedy.
4724220	4727660	Yeah, I think we talked about that book before on this podcast.
4727660	4728660	But what are you going to do?
4728660	4729660	Cancel me.
4729660	4731620	There's five episodes left.
4731620	4737180	But the other section of that book that's great is the handful of times that for some
4737180	4743320	reason whenever there was a mistake, it would be the far side's captions getting swapped
4743320	4745380	with the family circus.
4745380	4746380	Yeah.
4746380	4752220	It's like Billy's walking up to his mom and saying what a caveman fortune teller is supposed
4752220	4756100	to be saying to a caveman, which is Billy looking up at his mom and saying, I see your
4756100	4759620	skull on a shelf in an anthropologist's office.
4760620	4762620	Did that really happen?
4762620	4763620	Yeah.
4763620	4764620	Oh, awesome.
4764620	4769020	Family Circus is a freaking freak out.
4769020	4773620	When I used to work at Disneyland doing a sketch show where I used to play a drag character
4773620	4780140	in Frontierland, we would take Family Circus every day and then tear off the caption and
4780140	4781500	then write our own caption.
4781500	4783860	And it was the funniest thing in the world.
4783860	4788100	It's always funnier because nothing happens in Family Circus except just like oblique
4788100	4789100	sadness.
4789100	4796700	That was my first time taking acid when the acid trip was winding down, which is also
4796700	4802300	though sometimes when you get really punchy, acid could be more like, oh my god, whoa.
4802300	4804300	And that totally giggles and stuff.
4804300	4809020	But then as the acid tapers off, as I remember in my youth, I haven't done a ton of acid
4809020	4815780	except in my youth, but it tapers off into almost mushroomy, giggly thing.
4815780	4820940	And I just remember like the sun coming through the windows and listening to music, and we
4820940	4827220	just for some reason had this giant stack of Milwaukee journals, and we were just going
4827220	4832380	through every Family Circus on acid, like looking at every single one of them and like,
4832380	4833380	who's insane?
4833380	4838780	That cartoon is really insane if you're on acid.
4838780	4841860	What's this dotted line doing, man?
4841860	4844340	Why do we care where this kid has been?
4844340	4848500	How many goddamn times are they going to take this big Family Circus until they show
4848500	4849980	you where the kid was all day?
4849980	4850980	Oh, man.
4850980	4851980	He went over the fence twice.
4851980	4855660	The little kid was named Jeffrey, so people would always send me things saying like, Jeffrey
4855660	4856660	told...
4856660	4858020	There's one...
4858020	4862900	It's so fucking abstract and like, it's not funny, I don't know the point of view, like
4862900	4865260	what the fuck is going on?
4865260	4870900	And mommy, Jeffrey totaled his tricycle.
4870900	4874220	And it was Jeffrey crying with a tricycle on its side.
4874780	4878100	Because apparently, like, totaling your car was a new phrase back in 1978.
4878100	4880700	Oh, so it was like, it was kind of like, yeah.
4880700	4885020	And it's like, oh, I don't get it.
4885020	4888660	But I thought Garfield was good and funny, but guess what?
4888660	4889660	Nope.
4889660	4890660	Nope.
4890660	4891660	You were wrong.
4891660	4892660	Yeah, I'm in that boat.
4892660	4893660	Yeah.
4893660	4895660	I mean, I had Garfield notebooks back packed.
4895660	4896660	Oh, yeah.
4896660	4897660	I was like, Garfield's the best.
4897660	4898660	Yes.
4898660	4900540	And then you look back and you're like, what happened there?
4900540	4902100	It was like the war on drugs.
4902100	4903860	We just all bought it.
4903860	4907460	Because this cat's so fat.
4907460	4913940	At the age of seven years old, I never considered whether or not I would or would not do Mondays.
4913940	4924580	I guess it was just like, we hadn't seen a cat portrayed as so selfishly, like no cats
4924580	4927620	could be so solipsistic.
4927620	4930980	Go back to the animals of Garfield and watch his feet grow.
4930980	4939860	Because by the end of, like current Garfield, his feet are like 42 inches long.
4939860	4942660	And he has parts of a cat that cats don't have.
4942660	4943660	It's all fucked up.
4943660	4946420	It was parts that a cat doesn't have?
4946420	4952740	Yeah, but like, he has like, like, like a flimbus, like, I don't know, eyebrows.
4952740	4953740	Like I don't know.
4953740	4956340	It's just like, it's a shitty drawing of a cat.
4956340	4960420	Snoopy doesn't look much like a dog, but it's still recognizable as a dog.
4960420	4963820	Snoopy looks like an abomination.
4963820	4966820	Charlie Brown doesn't look like a human being.
4966820	4969420	Charlie Brown looks like a member of Congress.
4969420	4970820	Like he is a...
4970820	4972620	God damn it.
4972620	4973940	I bought a spider house.
4973940	4976900	It's supposed to be fucking spiders in my house.
4976900	4978340	What is going on?
4978340	4979340	It got away.
4979340	4981940	Cody sent me a picture of this giant spider.
4981940	4982940	Why are we away?
4982940	4984860	I hope we drop the ad in there.
4984860	4989380	Yeah, we gotta put the ad there.
4989620	4991460	I said, did you kill it?
4991460	4992980	She said, it got away.
4992980	4993980	It ran.
4993980	4994980	Now it knows.
4994980	4998220	Now it knows what you look like and your intentions.
4998220	5000860	It's teaching itself how to learn, Dan.
5000860	5005780	I smashed it a little, so it's possible injured, but it's gone.
5005780	5011500	If you can smash a spider and it runs away.
5011500	5012500	That happens.
5012500	5014700	I told you about the spider that I pulled out of my ear, and I stepped on it as hard
5014700	5015980	as I could.
5015980	5019220	And the spider went, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, and bone out.
5020020	5025540	Spiders don't give a shit about your foot, but they don't care about mass and energy.
5025540	5031740	I tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand with Palo Santo.
5031740	5033300	Hell yeah.
5033300	5034300	They like that.
5034300	5035300	What a valley girl.
5035300	5040660	She tried to smoke it out from under the nightstand.
5040660	5041660	There's all these mosquitoes.
5041660	5047340	Do you know there's this new breed of mosquito in LA that only needs a teacup of water to
5047340	5054960	have a million babies and they're smart and they only bite your ankles because they understand.
5054960	5056460	These things are all over my house.
5056460	5057460	You know about these new mosquitoes?
5057460	5058460	No.
5058460	5059460	What about the new mosquitoes?
5059460	5063660	You still fucked off when we tried to make you look at a book or something like that?
5063660	5066300	It's so quiet you've just been fuming over there.
5066300	5068140	The last thing you said was red.
5068140	5075380	I think it was just sitting there like, I'm going to fucking kill you in your sleep.
5076380	5080020	I was listening to the Garfield story.
5080020	5084580	Every time the new mosquitoes come out, the old ones stop working.
5084580	5088220	The old ones stop working.
5088220	5092420	We'll be right back.
5092420	5093980	Welcome back to Harman Town.
5093980	5098540	Did they really turn off old phones?
5098540	5099540	They stop working.
5099540	5103220	Obviously they won't admit it, but it just seems uncanny when the new phones are coming
5103220	5104220	out.
5105220	5109140	They did find some sort of thing.
5109140	5112220	They said they did.
5112220	5116980	Every time there's a new iPhone, my speaker, I can't hear.
5116980	5117980	It instantly goes out.
5117980	5118980	That's just age.
5128980	5132420	I've got more Garfield stories of you.
5132420	5134740	That guy used to look different than he does now.
5134740	5139300	He used to be like a big fat weird thing.
5139300	5144620	When they started leasing phones, I was like, come on, man.
5144620	5148980	That's my hot take.
5148980	5154820	The thing I'm going to miss most about Harman Town is the trenchant commentary on social
5154820	5155820	life like that.
5155820	5159740	I like the hand gesture that the listeners at home won't see.
5159740	5165820	They should have called it spider house.
5165820	5167420	Because it's a monster house?
5167420	5172020	Do you have $3 million and no spiders?
5172020	5173820	Let us solve both of your problems.
5173820	5176940	Have $0 and 3 million spiders.
5176940	5183540	Hi, I'm Bob Spider, realtor.
5183540	5191500	Do you want the convenience of living in a spider's nest without having to be a spider?
5191500	5196740	Come on down to this fucking hacienda.
5196740	5198820	How many spiders have you seen?
5198820	5201700	At least six.
5201700	5204340	How many rooms do you have?
5204340	5205340	At least seven.
5205340	5209380	No, I've seen a bunch of- Stay in the seventh room.
5209460	5213300	I was cruising around that house since before Furniture One showed up.
5213300	5217980	There's just been, I clocked at least 20, 30 spiders in the back of those times.
5217980	5218980	These are probably new spiders.
5218980	5221340	This is probably Generation 6 or 7.
5221340	5230500	While we're complaining about stuff, my old house in Los Feliz, I went over there recently.
5230500	5233100	There's rat turds all over the basement.
5233100	5234100	Oh shit.
5234100	5235100	Yeah.
5235100	5236100	Literally.
5236500	5240060	You know, throw out my sex doll.
5240060	5242020	And they were fucking like...
5242020	5246420	That basement has been a party for some- You still have the real doll from way back
5246420	5247420	up?
5247420	5248420	No, he threw it out.
5248420	5249420	Not anymore, brother.
5249420	5252700	You bought that a long, long time ago.
5252700	5253700	How did you dispose of that?
5253700	5255740	Just in the dumpster or what?
5255740	5256740	Called Levy.
5260740	5262740	You want to ask Levy what he did?
5263700	5265700	I want to ask him.
5265700	5268700	Let's bring out Steve Levy to find out the answer to that question.
5278700	5279700	Hello.
5280860	5281860	Thanks, everybody.
5281860	5286340	Oh, remember last episode we were talking about your quote unquote Jufro.
5286340	5288340	Yeah, that's a way.
5288340	5289340	Self-applied.
5289340	5290340	I wouldn't be so anti-Semitic.
5290340	5291340	Yeah, no, no.
5291340	5292340	Yeah.
5292940	5294940	You bought a regular fro.
5294940	5298420	You applied your Jufro?
5298420	5301780	I applied for a Jufro.
5301780	5302780	Let me know how I go.
5302780	5306180	You look a little bit like A-Rod now.
5306180	5308420	Yeah, that's true.
5308420	5309420	He's roiding too.
5309420	5311300	Are you roiding?
5311300	5312300	I didn't ask for this.
5312300	5316500	I kind of just go to a guy and he just goes, you know?
5316500	5317500	That's interesting.
5317500	5320380	It's just like, all right, I'm just like, yeah, I just make it shorter.
5320380	5325140	And then it's like every time it's a different work of art for him, he's a hair artist.
5325140	5326140	I don't know.
5326140	5327580	That's what he considers himself, right?
5327580	5328580	Sure.
5328580	5332340	But I saw Waldron this morning and he was like, nice Richard Spencer.
5332340	5334260	And I was like, fuck.
5334260	5335260	Fuck.
5335260	5336260	Richard Spencer?
5336260	5337260	Yeah.
5337260	5338260	I mean, what does he look like?
5338260	5340260	He just looks like a- Apparently he's got a haircut like this.
5340260	5342380	Well, I mean, you know.
5342380	5343380	Look.
5343380	5348180	Anyway, well, all right, so I call- Levy's no longer my assistant.
5348180	5350500	He's now an executive.
5350500	5352500	My executive.
5352500	5363540	Yeah, but my new assistant, I'm not going to ask her to throw away a box the size of
5363540	5365620	a child's coffin.
5365620	5366620	She couldn't lift it.
5366620	5371100	With Chinese lettering and Dan Harmon written on it in magic marker.
5371100	5373100	She wouldn't be able to lift it.
5373100	5378060	Well, yeah, she'd have to hire some people that I was like, man, this is crazy.
5378060	5379660	How do you get rid of one of these fucking things?
5379660	5383460	I've never thought- You called a morgue.
5383460	5385260	Was this the original doll that you bought a long time ago?
5385260	5387260	I'll figure it out eventually.
5387260	5395340	Was this doll number one or- She died from having a metal skeleton inside of her.
5395340	5397020	There was a second doll.
5397020	5398020	There was a second doll.
5398020	5406100	On the grassy knoll.
5406100	5408060	So I texted Levy.
5408060	5410340	Well, we made a deal.
5410340	5411340	Right.
5411340	5415380	Because you were like, oh, they need you to come back for a record before the screening
5415380	5416380	of this.
5416380	5418380	And I'm like, I'm over here with up to my knees.
5418380	5422180	For those of you who don't know, we've been talking a lot about all of our celebrities
5422180	5428540	that are voicing characters on Rick and Morty, but really, you're the new Ryan Ridley in
5428540	5429540	terms of voice.
5429540	5432580	You're a lot of really funny characters.
5432580	5434620	You guys will see Dan Harmon.
5434620	5435620	Great voice actor.
5435620	5441540	Some of the funny characters that you'll be seeing on Rick and Morty, but mostly hearing
5441540	5442540	are.
5442540	5443540	Yeah.
5443540	5444540	Have you heard- Mr. Egg.
5444540	5449940	Dan, I heard that you do- Captain Yeast.
5449940	5450940	You do Harvey Fierstein.
5450940	5451940	They're all food-related.
5451940	5455380	Can we hear your Harvey Fierstein that you're doing on season-
5455380	5456380	Harvey Fierstein.
5456380	5457380	Sorry.
5457380	5458380	Sorry.
5458380	5459380	Okay.
5459380	5460380	Yeah.
5460380	5461380	We made this.
5461380	5463380	We needed you to come in to record some of your characters.
5463380	5464380	Right.
5464620	5468020	So then you needed me, and I was in the middle of moving stuff, and I'm like, all right,
5468020	5473420	look, I'll make you a deal, because I had just finished wrapping this greasy box up
5473420	5478380	and was like, how am I going to fucking- what do you do with this thing?
5478380	5482140	Everyone has one friend with a pickup and maybe knows where a dump is.
5482140	5487780	I've led a privileged life, and I just have this body in a box.
5487780	5490140	It's like- It's like 200 pounds.
5490140	5492220	Yeah, because- It's very heavy.
5492220	5493740	The skeleton is titanium.
5494100	5495100	Yeah.
5495100	5496100	On these things.
5496100	5497100	What?
5497100	5498100	They got a recycled machine.
5498100	5503620	So I just kind of wrapped it up in two layers of plastic bag, the box, and wrapped duct
5503620	5507940	tape all around it, and then I texted, leave you a photo of it, and stay on my bedroom
5507940	5508940	floor.
5508940	5513540	It's like, if you come over here, and this thing is gone when I get back, then I'll go
5513540	5521220	to work right now, and he's like, deal, I'm on my way, and it's like an old political
5521220	5522220	thriller.
5522220	5523620	You literally know where the bodies are, Barry.
5523620	5525260	It was quid pro quo.
5525260	5526260	Yeah.
5526260	5528860	Where did you take it, Levy?
5528860	5531060	So I- And who'd you call?
5531060	5532060	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5532060	5533060	We'll get there.
5533060	5534060	Yay.
5534060	5540100	So, I went up to Dan's bedroom, assessed this giant box.
5540100	5545140	I brought tape and a Sharpie of my own, just in case you weren't able to cover up your name.
5545140	5547900	Crash out the name Dan Harmon on this box.
5547900	5549940	I don't know what you have at your house, or whatever.
5549940	5554060	So it is a really heavy box.
5554060	5556980	I know.
5556980	5557980	It was probably-
5557980	5558980	What are you telling me?
5558980	5562900	It was probably between 80 and 115 pounds.
5562900	5564660	No, it's over 100.
5564660	5565660	It's gotta be.
5565660	5567620	Well, I lifted the whole thing.
5567620	5572700	It really gave me a glimpse into the life of a serial killer, because we've joked about
5572700	5576340	in my youth with my fetishes and things, and me getting mannequin legs and things like
5576340	5577340	that.
5577340	5587180	Like plastic things, but this body, and the idea of getting rid of it, and the whole thing
5587180	5593300	being like, this needs to go away, as opposed to this thing is a thing that you can have
5593300	5594300	and just store it somewhere.
5594300	5599540	But it's like the idea of this needs to go away and no one needs to ever find it.
5599540	5603100	It was this introduction in my head, I was sort of like, God, can you imagine if it was
5603100	5611020	also rotting and was an actual crime instead of just a thing that could ruin your life
5611020	5612180	and make everyone laugh at you?
5612180	5617340	But it was sort of like, minus the fact that it's actually heavier than an equal sized
5617340	5622620	body would be, it was just such a weird glimpse into that world.
5622620	5628180	Isn't there like a real doll website, like an FAQ portion, or how do I dispose of this
5628180	5629180	when I'm through?
5629500	5633380	I don't think they want to shine a light on the fact that these things are actually, that
5633380	5636140	they must eventually go away.
5636140	5639300	I think pet stores are the same way.
5639300	5644380	They don't say, hey look at this Maltese ticket to a fucking heartbreaking tragedy seven years
5644380	5645380	from now.
5645380	5646380	Seven!
5646380	5652980	Did you have any like, on average, I'm guessing the answer is no, but did you have any like,
5652980	5658380	how much time did you spend with this doll, and did you feel kind of any weird attachment
5658380	5659380	to it?
5659380	5663660	Not like in a human way, but like, no.
5663660	5666260	Bye Laura.
5666260	5667540	She wanted you to say yes.
5667540	5668700	Steve, yeah.
5668700	5669940	Did you look inside?
5669940	5670940	No.
5670940	5671940	God, no.
5671940	5673940	That's not part of the job.
5673940	5676420	Steve, did you fuck it?
5676420	5680220	I was curious like, what the head looked like.
5680220	5683380	Not like, just like, I don't know what these things actually look like.
5683380	5684380	I've never looked at a picture.
5684380	5685380	They're online.
5685380	5686380	You could see that online.
5686380	5687380	Yeah, I know.
5687380	5688380	Yeah, but whatever.
5688380	5689380	You should have.
5689380	5694020	I thought that maybe there was some sentimental value because of Dummy, because it inspired
5694020	5695020	a show.
5695020	5699340	Yeah, I sent a photo of the box all taped up to Cody, who I don't think ever saw it.
5699340	5703580	She was always asking me, can I please see it, and I'm like, no, because I'm ashamed
5703580	5706980	of it.
5706980	5711860	One thing to be honest about having it, it's another thing, I don't want you looking at
5711860	5712860	it.
5713860	5717620	It's like, me sitting up here saying I have a small dick, and I was like, I don't know,
5717620	5721260	I'm like, I want to show you it.
5721260	5722260	Cody's never seen your dick.
5722260	5723260	Of course not.
5723260	5733460	Levi had to put it in a box and dispose of it.
5733460	5741780	I will say one thing for people, I don't know, just like these graphic details, now that
5741780	5750380	I imagine I am a previous sex doll owner that will never probably own another one,
5750380	5760900	the one weird detail about it is probably the arm, the shoulder joints.
5760900	5765820	You imagine you're dealing with this thing that has this skeleton, and it has ball and
5765820	5770260	socket joints where the shoulders are, it has, I think, ball and socket joints where
5770260	5778340	the hips are, because you want to be able to, gee, I Joe, the thighs, wherever you want,
5778340	5786180	but then the knees and the elbows are simple, 90 degree, whatever you call it, they rotate
5786180	5793500	on one axis, not 360, but the shoulders and the hips are ball and socket.
5793500	5797740	For the legs, that's not really a problem, because you're not going to move the legs
5797740	5803980	in a way that you're going to then forget, like the legs are just a bigger deal.
5803980	5810100	The arms, however, should you be deciding to, I don't know, put a special outfit on
5810100	5819300	this thing, a cute top you picked out, you're going to be like, you're going to be moving
5819300	5830220	the arms up, and then you might move the arms down, and then you might move the arms
5830220	5837020	this way, and then you might move the arms this way, and then there's what we would call
5837020	5842140	in the 3D animation business, kind of like a gimbal lock kind of effect that can happen
5842140	5849340	where the root rotation is kind of lost, and you can notice over time, like this thing
5849340	5858220	was in the box, and the biceps had just become like twizzlers, like they're just twisted,
5858220	5861820	because the arms at some point had been rotated 360 degrees.
5861820	5864420	But Dan, some people find that pretty sexy.
5865420	5872460	Well, also the fact that the silicone skin, which, you know, health experts will tell
5872460	5879020	you it's constantly off-gassing, like, so it's probably like, what the fuck is that?
5879020	5881540	It's the spider.
5881540	5882540	Long web.
5882540	5885860	Man, if they ever make flying spiders, I'm going to kill myself.
5885860	5888980	Well, they say spiders actually do fly.
5888980	5889980	Yeah.
5889980	5890980	Because of the...
5890980	5891980	Didn't you see...
5891980	5893380	That's how they were able to spin their webs so large.
5893380	5894380	Far from home?
5894820	5897060	Okay, so Dan, listen up.
5897060	5899460	No one can look this up.
5899460	5904040	Spiders shoot out a silk that goes in the air, and then it catches, like, electron particles
5904040	5909140	or something in the air, and then it magnetically propels them like they're surfing or flying
5909140	5910140	a kite.
5910140	5911300	All right, well then I'm already dead.
5911300	5912300	Oh, yeah.
5912300	5915500	So is Jeff.
5915500	5916500	So is the audience.
5916500	5918500	Yeah, I think that thing's like a bat.
5918500	5920500	All right, so...
5920500	5921500	Sex doll.
5921500	5922500	Wait, what was the...
5922500	5923500	Oh, there's a...
5924140	5927940	So you're fucking a Twizzler, and you mean fucking it.
5927940	5932460	For future sex doll owners, I do want to tell you one more thing.
5932460	5936580	Watch those fingers, because the fingers are wires, they're just like gumby.
5936580	5939500	So if you care, I mean, I didn't.
5939500	5940500	I'm like...
5940500	5942140	I'm not like a finger guy.
5942140	5943140	So but...
5943140	5944420	I'm a big finger guy.
5944420	5949500	They're just going to eventually just always be in this permanent state of a witch about
5949500	5951500	to cast a spell.
5951940	5954940	Shrobs doing a funny...
5954940	5956500	Let's keep taking a picture.
5956500	5957500	That's a pretty good...
5963100	5963940	Hubba hubba.
5963940	5966060	And then...
5966060	5971460	And don't lay it down on anything with ink in it.
5971460	5976860	Like if you were to lay, because the silicone is like...
5976860	5977860	Yeah.
5977860	5978860	It's sort of like...
5978860	5979860	Like silicone.
5980380	5983380	The silicone is sort of like a...
5983380	5990700	They can't store old Star Trek prosthetics, because silicone is constantly in a...
5990700	5992940	It's slowly turning to goo.
5992940	5993940	Just very slowly.
5993940	5997060	Which is what you want.
5997060	6004060	And in the short term though, if you were to take a silicone form and lay it on something
6004060	6012420	that had like a cardboard box that had writing on it, then that writing could be on its tattoo,
6012420	6014900	on its arm forever.
6014900	6016140	What was on hers?
6016140	6017140	This side up.
6017140	6018140	Yeah, well...
6018140	6019140	What does it say?
6019140	6022140	What did it say, FedEx?
6027140	6031580	I mean, I want it to be something fun, but it was just green.
6031580	6032580	It was just fucking...
6032580	6034580	Whatever it was laid on at one point...
6034580	6035580	It wasn't a speck or anything.
6035580	6036580	It was just like...
6036580	6041580	So I looked down at this thing before I saw it for the last time, and it was just like
6041580	6045180	these twisted arms that were all like...
6045180	6050580	They really did look, as I imagine, almost like decomposing, like discolored, like greenish-blueish...
6050580	6051580	Horrifying.
6051580	6054580	Like the sister in Pet Sematary.
6054580	6056580	Did you say the face is all fucked up?
6056580	6059580	Like the neck is open?
6060580	6064580	Yeah, the neck got like a tear in it at some point.
6064580	6067580	And unless you're going to like super glue it...
6067580	6070580	Dan, what was your first interaction?
6070580	6071580	When you got your first...
6071580	6073580	Because I remember that you got your first...
6073580	6074580	Hello!
6074580	6075580	You got your first real doll.
6075580	6077580	What do we have here?
6077580	6079580	We didn't see you for a while.
6079580	6081580	You said quite candidly that you're going to go away for a while.
6081580	6082580	My name's Daniel.
6082580	6084580	But when you first got out of the box...
6084580	6088580	No, you don't have to talk.
6088580	6089580	Let me just...
6089580	6092580	Let me just look at you for a second.
6092580	6093580	Oh.
6093580	6094580	Oh.
6094580	6096580	That's very interesting.
6096580	6099580	You say your shoulders are sore.
6099580	6102580	I'm like trying moves on...
6102580	6103580	I wait...
6103580	6108580	Yeah, we could watch a movie if you'd like.
6108580	6111580	Oh, I am tired too.
6111580	6112580	A bed?
6112580	6113580	Yes, I have one.
6113580	6115580	Why do you ask?
6115580	6120580	I could drag you to the other room.
6120580	6124580	Don't touch my fingers.
6124580	6128580	Throw your octopus hands in the bed and...
6128580	6130580	Did you ever take a nap?
6130580	6131580	Do you ever cuddle?
6131580	6133580	Was there any post-quital stuff?
6133580	6134580	No.
6134580	6135580	You ever warm it up?
6135580	6136580	Water it up?
6136580	6137580	Warm it up.
6137580	6138580	Throw it in the microwave.
6138580	6140580	Warm it up like an electric blanket so it's got some body temperature.
6140580	6142580	No, I put pantyhose on it and rubbed the toes on my nipples,
6142580	6145580	jerked off, fell asleep.
6145580	6152580	That'll warm you right up.
6152580	6155580	I honestly wouldn't if I were...
6155580	6156580	I'm going to be with...
6156580	6157580	Cody is like...
6157580	6163580	Cody eliminates the need for any extracurricular...
6163580	6167580	Let's maintain our privacy, but...
6167580	6173580	I don't need products anymore, but...
6173580	6179580	If in an alternate universe, knowing what I now know as a consumer,
6179580	6183580	just to shed light on my experience with these products,
6183580	6184580	I would just get...
6184580	6187580	On Amazon now, you can just get...
6187580	6188580	There's like...
6188580	6189580	You can pick the...
6189580	6192580	You can get just a foot.
6192580	6195580	You can get just a calf and a foot.
6195580	6197580	You can get just a calf, foot, and thigh.
6197580	6200580	You can get a foot with a pussy in it.
6200580	6201580	Yes, you can.
6201580	6204580	Which is really weird because the pussy is in the ankle.
6204580	6205580	The vagina.
6205580	6209580	I just want to look at the foot, but upside down,
6209580	6212580	God, I always just wish there was a pussy there.
6212580	6215580	And it's shaped like a pussy, which is weird.
6215580	6216580	Because it's like...
6216580	6219580	Wait, how could you have ever wanted that as a primate?
6219580	6223580	Like, that doesn't exist in nature even close.
6224580	6226580	I want just a calf.
6226580	6227580	Just a calf.
6227580	6228580	Yeah, but you can...
6228580	6229580	I think...
6229580	6234580	You know, it's like you can also just get just the ass and two legs,
6234580	6239580	which I think maybe based on everything I've learned to know,
6239580	6241580	that's probably the kind of guy I am.
6245580	6250580	As far as the use I'm going to get out of an artificial female body,
6250580	6253580	I'm pretty much good to go,
6253580	6257580	like with a pair of fake legs and things.
6257580	6258580	You know, like I wouldn't...
6258580	6260580	I just find the...
6260580	6265580	It was like, I'm not a good caretaker.
6268580	6271580	And, you know, never been a boob man.
6271580	6275580	And, you know, it's like...
6275580	6279580	I was excited at the prospect because I love...
6280580	6282580	You know, like, oh, you could get it wigs and you can...
6282580	6284580	But the thing you find out really quickly is,
6284580	6290580	hey, you know, human women, like, they really take really good care of their hair.
6291580	6294580	It's really a constant battle against tangling
6294580	6297580	and you can't just not care about something
6297580	6301580	and like have it also be this thing that you find really...
6301580	6303580	Way to go, human women.
6305580	6306580	Okay, we got like seven...
6306580	6307580	This one's for you.
6307580	6308580	What did you do with the...
6308580	6310580	I'm proud of you.
6310580	6312580	What did you do with the crate?
6312580	6313580	I...
6313580	6317580	It'd be vague because we don't want somebody digging it up somewhere and going...
6317580	6318580	I got it!
6319580	6323580	Well, we're going to announce a strange kind of contest now.
6324580	6330580	The prize is $200,000 in the form of a scholarship
6330580	6334580	and, of course, your own half-rotted sex doll
6334580	6337580	with green twisted arms.
6338580	6342580	I lifted up this enormous box
6342580	6345580	and I carried it down the stairs
6345580	6347580	and all the way down to my car
6347580	6349580	and then I loaded it into my backseat
6349580	6350580	because it was...
6350580	6353580	It's the only space I could have fitted it in.
6354580	6356580	It was a weird, long box.
6356580	6359580	And then I got in my car, yeah.
6359580	6362580	And I was like, I don't...
6362580	6364580	Well, the first thing I thought was...
6364580	6367580	I passed a dumpster on the way here
6367580	6369580	but I feel like that's not safe enough
6369580	6372580	just in case some random person was digging through
6372580	6373580	and saw this taped-up box.
6373580	6376580	I was like, it still had Dan's name on it somewhere
6376580	6377580	underneath all that wrapping.
6377580	6379580	I was like, yeah, it's not a good idea.
6379580	6382580	So I called Spencer and I was like...
6382580	6385580	And you know how I felt when I fielded this call?
6385580	6388580	Why did he not call me?
6388580	6390580	Why did Dan not ask me to take care of this?
6390580	6393580	This is classic Spencer job.
6394580	6395580	I was hurt.
6395580	6396580	You've been free a long time.
6396580	6397580	I know, but still.
6397580	6399580	It would have been an insult to call you.
6399580	6400580	I was hurt.
6400580	6404580	I was like, man, I really thought we had something.
6407580	6410580	You're the Harvey Keitel to his...
6410580	6411580	I'm the wolf.
6411580	6413580	That's what that guy was called, right?
6413580	6414580	You know, Pulp Fiction?
6414580	6415580	Yeah.
6415580	6418580	Well, Spencer gave me a lot of great options.
6419580	6422580	His were really buttoned up.
6422580	6424580	We would have gotten away with it for sure.
6424580	6425580	We did.
6426580	6427580	Yeah.
6427580	6429580	It was a lot more work, though.
6430580	6432580	I called our PA up on...
6432580	6434580	Now, writer's assistant on Rick and Morty.
6434580	6435580	Oh, good.
6438580	6439580	See, this is what I mean.
6439580	6440580	No, no, no.
6440580	6445580	I just said, hey, where's the best dumpster you know?
6445580	6448580	Not too far from the office.
6448580	6451580	And he suggested a really great one.
6451580	6453580	And that's where the body...
6453580	6455580	Shouldn't be too hard to figure out.
6455580	6457580	So if you could triangulate the location...
6457580	6458580	Well, it's not still there.
6458580	6459580	The dumps.
6459580	6461580	And there's a lot of dumpsters.
6461580	6462580	It was today.
6462580	6463580	It wasn't today.
6463580	6464580	No, it wasn't today.
6464580	6465580	It wasn't.
6465580	6467580	I was with you all day today.
6467580	6468580	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6470580	6474580	You know that dumpsters, like waste management services,
6474580	6476580	are straight up hooked up with TMZ.
6476580	6478580	And they're going to fucking find out about this.
6478580	6480580	And they're going to say that Dan Harmon threw it out.
6480580	6481580	Well, I think I've been pretty much...
6481580	6483580	I don't think there's anything left to do except...
6483580	6485580	Like I said, you just look at the thing.
6485580	6486580	It's embarrassing.
6486580	6489580	But I think I've been pretty forthcoming with the fucking details.
6489580	6495580	I hope we live in a society where fucking honesty buys you something.
6495580	6496580	But I know we don't.
6496580	6498580	So we're ending the podcast.
6498580	6502580	And in the meantime, I'm not going to go out lying.
6502580	6503580	I'm going to go out...
6503580	6505580	Hey, I threw out my fucking sex doll.
6505580	6506580	Here's what it looked like.
6506580	6508580	Like, all right, go find it.
6508580	6512580	But it's greasy and gross.
6513580	6514580	It's covered in cigarette.
6514580	6515580	This was weeks ago.
6515580	6516580	This thing is long gone.
6518580	6524580	Do you think there's waste management people that find a used real doll and go like...
6524580	6528580	Did we send all that stuff to China?
6529580	6530580	We don't anymore.
6530580	6532580	We used to send all our garbage to China.
6532580	6533580	Yeah, they buy it up.
6533580	6534580	Yeah, they stopped.
6534580	6536580	They stopped like recently.
6536580	6537580	They're like, we're done.
6537580	6539580	We've got all the garbage we need.
6539580	6540580	Thank you.
6540580	6541580	I never knew.
6541580	6543580	And then we were like, well, what are we going to do with all the garbage now?
6543580	6544580	Keep it.
6544580	6545580	That's what we did.
6546580	6547580	Jesus.
6548580	6549580	That is what they did.
6549580	6551580	Yeah, we don't want it anymore.
6551580	6554580	Yeah, they could have got a whole skeleton of titanium.
6554580	6555580	That's valuable.
6555580	6560580	Wait, so we were like always constantly lambasting China for falling behind in the terms of
6560580	6563580	like the global like pollution standards and stuff.
6563580	6564580	And we were like...
6564580	6565580	We were just giving them our shit.
6565580	6567580	America is like, we have less...
6567580	6569580	We're like shoveling shit over to them.
6569580	6571580	They used to be like, you're throwing on all this stuff?
6571580	6572580	This is a good TV.
6572580	6573580	What are you doing?
6577580	6583580	China was just like that character in the scavenger zone of every cyberpunk movie.
6584580	6585580	The Recycler?
6585580	6586580	Recycler?
6589580	6590580	Poop Van.
6591580	6592580	All right, well, that's it.
6592580	6593580	Poop Van, too.
6593580	6594580	What do we got to plug?
6594580	6596580	Spencer, don't you have a...?
6596580	6598580	Harvest Quest still exists.
6598580	6603580	It's all out, so you can watch it on a free trial now if you want.
6603580	6607580	Email them and tell them to put it out of the America if you want to see it out of the
6607580	6610580	America and tell them to give us another season.
6610580	6614580	And then I also did YouTube commentaries of this season.
6614580	6618580	So you can see like a goblin and be like, you know, the thing about that goblin is
6618580	6621580	he used to be red or whatever the fuck.
6623580	6624580	So that's fun.
6624580	6625580	And then, I don't know.
6625580	6626580	Are we going to get another season?
6626580	6627580	Do we know about that yet?
6627580	6629580	I don't know about that.
6629580	6633580	And we won't know for probably too long, like an embarrassing amount of time.
6633580	6637580	So that's why you got to tell them, be all like, oh, man, I meant to give you guys
6637580	6641580	money, but next time I will if you do another season or something, you know.
6641580	6642580	Cliffhanger!
6642580	6643580	Oh, okay.
6643580	6644580	Holy sky.
6644580	6645580	Yeah, I get to plug.
6645580	6646580	Thank you all for coming.
6646580	6647580	Oh, shit!
