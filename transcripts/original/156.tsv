0	12000	Come, come, come there. Come, come, come, come all. Come, come, come everywhere and break your scarf and shawl. I'm the little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.
12000	24000	Come, come, come over here. Come, come, come to the south. Come, come on your feet. Come, come in my mouth. I'm a little show promoter and I'm three feet tall.
24000	33000	I'm a little velvet man of nicks in a tree. All I do is promote shows all that I see. Please go to see Rob Schneider at the truck show.
33000	42000	He was in Dukes of Hazzard, now he's nowhere to go. Because his car had a racist flag on it. I'm the little show promoter and I wear a bonnet.
42000	48000	It was my mom's idea, she made me a baby. I want to fuck her or kill her or maybe.
49000	57000	Harmontown is now in session. Please welcome the stage, the mayor of Harmontown, Mr. Dan Harlan.
63000	69000	Come, come, come there. Come, come, come all. Come, come, come everywhere and break your scarf and shawl.
69000	71000	Thank you, thank you.
75000	80000	That song was created by a fellow named Michael Hartigan if you're out there. Michael, thank you very much for your beautiful service.
80000	86000	Dan, you have an enormous thermos on stage right now. At least tell me that's not all vodka in there.
86000	100000	I have switched my cheat day to Sundays on my diet and this is a pina colada that Aaron made me.
100000	104000	It's a, I think it's a gallon.
104000	121000	She's been really, she's really been feeding me today. I'm kind of in a food coma. I may puke onto the microphone and onto Anatoly.
121000	127000	So you just this week decided to switch to Sunday cheat day?
127000	128000	Yeah.
129000	135000	So last week when you ate the cheeseburger out of the Bloody Mary on stage, that was just comedy sake, right? That was just entertainment.
135000	140000	I can't, oh yeah, no, I stayed on the, wait, what do you mean? Last week was the show was on Sunday.
140000	143000	Oh right. So you switched it last week?
143000	146000	Jesus Christ, who cares?
149000	151000	So we're gonna lie to these people.
151000	155000	Wait, what is that? Is there a logo on that thermos? That thing is enormous.
155000	158000	Yeah, I gotta remember to bring this back to Aaron.
158000	166000	And I, and I, I enjoy a pina colada. A gallon seems a little over the top.
166000	169000	I don't want to waste my cheat day.
171000	174000	But I may puke all over everyone.
174000	184000	Because I ate, I got up this morning and I ate at 6.45 a.m. and I used Postmates to order McDonald's breakfast.
185000	190000	Did you get up that early because you always wake up at that early or because it's a cheat day and you want to start?
190000	195000	Yeah, it's because I've been, because I've been, you may have noticed I've never lost any weight ever.
195000	202000	So you're probably wondering is this diet work? Well, it can if you stick to it. I've never stuck to it.
202000	205000	I've like, like cheat days turn into cheat weekends, turn into cheat weeks.
205000	213000	And so I just basically am the same fatness that I always am. But, but, but I've last like three weeks or so.
214000	221000	I've been really committing to the diet. So this, then this last like period was particularly hard on me.
222000	230000	The idea of the cheat day being that you like, you full your body back into a like a glycemic thing or, and then you go off it.
230000	237000	Yeah, I think it's just keeping your body off rhythm. I never read the book that the, Aaron, Aaron read it.
237000	241000	I think it's basically like Atkins without dairy, but you're allowed to eat beans.
241000	250000	So it's beans, meat and veggies all week. And then one day a week so that your body, probably so your body doesn't go into ketosis or just adjust mental health.
250000	256000	Just adjust metabolically. You are supposed to spike your blood sugar and your, you know, your blood sugar.
256000	267000	You're supposed to spike your blood sugar. And you're supposed to eat like a birthday cake and just rub Big Macs on your balls and just wear a pizza for a hat.
267000	280000	And I'm like, and I do. I really take it very seriously. And so I got the, I got the McDonald's and I sat down and I played Witcher 3.
280000	291000	And yeah, yeah, yep. And then, and then at some point, Aaron came, came home with some Del Taco and I just didn't move.
291000	305000	And I just kept eating the room slowly filled up with farts. And so she would like slide stuff over to me and she made sliders and like Mac and cheese with Doritos sprinkled on them and a big pina colada and a pineapple.
305000	316000	And I said, I should bring this to the show. And she made me a big pina colada. So if you're on the fence about getting married, you know, you know, it's fine.
316000	324000	I, I said, I said, Aaron, what's this? What is this straw? What's the straw from? And she said, that is an unused as it stopped.
324000	337000	Don't if you have to say it's unused, you're not about to say a Mesa straw from the party store.
337000	349000	It's probably an antifreeze and licensed pre-owned bull Catherine.
349000	358000	But do you think the holes of a bull's penises are bigger than you think?
358000	363000	No.
363000	368000	Well, I, I heard a guy going like, no, that's a two different people.
368000	379000	I think they're probably a little bigger. I mean, they gotta be like a little. Well, why do I mean they gotta be? I wonder if urethras are all the same diameter. Of course not.
379000	390000	Of course not. A goldfish doesn't have a mouse's urethra is thinner than mine. I hope it's like a party straw.
390000	403000	Mine's like a party straw. Mouse's is like a little baby party straw. And then like, so I'm sure like a whale's, you could probably put a ping pong ball down it.
404000	410000	And it would probably have space around it. The ping pong ball.
410000	419000	Witcher three probably not going to get any high marks on the feminist gamer report card.
419000	429000	I kind of got tit fatigue playing that game. There's a lot of titties in that game. A lot of strong women, I guess, but they're strong and they have their tits are everywhere.
429000	440000	I'm truly bored with tits right now. Are the guys semi-clad too or negative? I guess I, well, there's no, I mean, no, it's the same old, same old, I think, hypocritical thing.
440000	450000	Like the, the, the, the protagonist is, I guess he's kind of a beefcake, but he's covered in scars and he's pale.
450000	459000	And then everyone else is just a big fat guy, I think, or a dwarf. I'm not saying dwarves can't be attractive. Sorry, fellas.
459000	468000	But, but it's a lot of, it's a lot of, a lot of, a lot of D cups and a lot of, a lot of acting like they're just normal, it's just normal for them to just be out.
469000	480000	And, and it's, I'm really enjoying it. It's like, it's one of, it's one of those games where, where you do the, where it has like relationship options, you know?
480000	489000	Like there's like different characters and you're sort of like, while you're playing the game, you have like these multiple kind of romantic roads you can go down.
490000	501000	But it, I, I, there's this, there's this woman in the beginning of the game that you like and then she's treating you like garbage, even though you clearly like her.
501000	506000	So then, and then, but then it's kind of clear like, oh, she's must be like the female lead kind of thing.
506000	511000	Like, I guess I'm supposed to have a will they, won't they with her? And I guess I'll meet up with her later.
511000	521000	But then in the meantime, there was this redhead and I was just like, will you marry me? And then it's like, so now the rest of the game, I'm like, the, the regular one is like keeps on.
521000	533000	I don't know. It's, it kind of, the game kind of fucks you over because it definitely gives you the option of totally full on monogamous commitment to this, to this redheaded sorceress.
533000	537000	If the first woman that was to treat you cruelly were a redhead, would you be more into her?
538000	543000	Yes. Okay. And, and that's not, and that's not my fault because this is like, you know, it's a video game.
543000	550000	So it's like the hair, like, especially like, it's like, what else is there? You know, like, it's like, I don't know.
550000	555000	And there's like, well, the first, like I said, the first one, I don't like the, I don't like the strident type.
555000	563000	I don't, I don't go for that, that business. I don't, but it doesn't make my little wiener jump up when, when somebody's like, you're a piece of shit.
563000	571000	I'm not like, yeah. I like, I like a little equivalence.
571000	575000	Wasn't the redhead and the recent Jurassic Park kind of strident? Wouldn't she kind of a tough nut?
575000	580000	Well, there's a difference between like, like with, withdrawn and like mean.
580000	581000	Oh, okay.
581000	586000	Because the mean thing seems dishonest if you're going to end up actually, you know, coupling with someone.
586000	592000	Like, well, then you didn't mean it when you said I was a poo poo face, right? Because otherwise you're a poo poo face fucker.
593000	599000	So now, and now I'm a liar fucker and a poo poo face, but not a, or not a poo poo face.
599000	602000	We know people that like being called a poo poo face. That's what turns them on.
602000	607000	Yeah. Like, like Dino, Dino likes being called a poo poo face. Yeah. He likes actually, he likes poo poo on his face.
608000	614000	Yeah. I don't, I'm not, me, me, not so much. I don't like, I get, I get, I get mad when people humiliate me.
614000	616000	Even, even in the video game realm?
616000	621000	Well, yeah, even, yeah, just like even, even as part of the program of that game.
621000	628000	Yeah. Well, I'm especially, well, anyway, so that's the thing. So this game really sets you up to, to, to, I'm in the midst of this right now.
628000	632000	I almost want to stop playing the game because it is, I am kind of immersed in it.
632000	642000	The first girl, it wasn't working. I decided. It was like, well, she, she decided. She said, like, I don't, you know, she's like cold shouldering me.
642000	649000	I kept the, for the first couple levels, I'm like, Hey, what do you think of me? And she's, and she's like, Oh, I, I'm British and I have black hair.
649000	658000	So I'm like that archetype and I'm gone. And then this, then this redhead sorceress and she's nurturing and she cares about the other mages.
658000	671000	And I helped her do this whole, like Harriet Tubman underground mage railroad story where we're like, we, we, we got the mages out of, out of the city before the horrible anti-mage Hitler was going to kill them all.
671000	674000	And it's like, that kind of, that, that turns me on.
674000	680000	That sounds to me like that. You're supposed to fall in love with her and not the black haired British lady from the beginning.
680000	681000	Wait, sorry, what?
681000	683000	That sounds like they're, they're setting you up to love her.
683000	689000	They set, they set me up. They, they, they, yes, because it's obviously available in the program because I did.
689000	694000	I was like, I kissed her. You know, I could have not kissed her. And then I, so I chose to kiss her.
694000	705000	And then, because she looks like my wife and, and then, and then I was like, yeah, I'm going to choose her because I see this as one of these multiple choose your romance games.
705000	715000	So I'm definitely, this is good that they let me not choose this, this strident, you know, British cold, cold, cold, cold, cold applesauce person.
715000	724000	It's like, you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a raven haired heartbreaker. I'm going to, I'm so mean to you, like your mommy.
724000	729000	I'm not, thank you for not making me do that. I like this. I like this. I like this nurturing type.
729000	732000	Are there other options or is there a third woman? Are you?
732000	741000	Well, I'm not, I feel like I'm like a quarter through the game and I'm already fucked because I, so, so I like the redhead, I was like, you know, I was like, well, don't, okay.
741000	745000	We did the adventure and then, and then there was an option that said, please don't go. And I was like, please don't go.
745000	750000	And then there was an option that said, I love you. And I was like, I love you. And then, and then she's like, okay, I'll stay.
750000	757000	And I'm like, okay, great. Um, and then, and then we had sex in a, in a, in a lighthouse.
757000	765000	And then, are you typing things in or is this, are these options that come up on the screen?
765000	772000	These are, these are like, these are like, these are like story options you're choosing based on like, you know, three dialogue decisions.
772000	774000	So now you're married to this redhead.
774000	779000	But I'm merrier, but I might as well have. I like, yeah, I might make me love in this.
779000	783000	What level of intimacy do they, do they show you while you're making?
783000	784000	It's really weird.
784000	786000	Do they cut to a train going into a tunnel?
786000	794000	Well, they don't, they show you both naked. Then they show like her naked butt and then they show my hands slide over her butt.
794000	800000	But then they cut to just a wall. And there was like, but there wasn't even like a shadow of humping or anything.
800000	805000	But it was like, there's like, they already showed like boobs and butts and like, it's clearly, it's not for kids this game.
805000	816000	Like they say the C word in it and, and the F word all the time. Fuck is the F word that the, the, the, anyways.
816000	822000	So, so, so I made love to redhead on a lighthouse in a lighthouse.
822000	824000	Not on a lighthouse, that's dangerous.
824000	825000	In, in it.
825000	827000	Yeah, they're kind of pointy on top.
827000	835000	So then, and then, and then she goes like, so I guess, and then we had the conversation of like, oh, so I guess, uh, I guess we're going to be together forever.
835000	844000	Yeah. But I gotta, I gotta finish this video game though. Like, like, like, I was like, I gotta finish like the next 85% of the game without her.
844000	851000	Right. Because it's not like the game is so sophisticated that now she's just hanging out, like, going like, we're in love too.
851000	856000	So you, so I just said I love you to see her butt and then she leaves the game.
856000	864000	And now, I'm in the part of the game, well, now that I have to go be with the brunette and the, and the, but the game is making my character keep flirting with the brunette.
864000	869000	It's not a choice. He keeps saying stuff like, oh, you smell good. And I'm like, I didn't say that.
869000	878000	I'm from Wisconsin. I wouldn't pull this shit. This is the kind of guy I hate.
878000	882000	And they're making me, so I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Am I supposed to, is the game supposed to?
882000	890000	There should be an option, or maybe there shouldn't, but to go back to the redhead woman and say, look, I know that there's probably 80% more video game out there.
890000	893000	But I'd rather hit game over with you.
893000	900000	I'm kind of, it's kind of where I'm at. Yeah. I kind of wish I, honestly, I would push the, the brunette off a cliff if I, if it was an option.
901000	908000	Well, because she wants, I mean, well, cause I would say, I'm sorry. It's, I'm, you smell nice.
908000	915000	The game, the game, the game keeps making me act like I want to fuck you, but I don't want to. So I'm going to murder you.
915000	925000	And she's like, you're mentally ill. Cause she doesn't know it's a video game. So she's, is there, can you come on too hard where she hates you?
926000	936000	I'm not going to try that. There are options where it says like, you can lay it on even thicker and I'm just choosing the neutral, just like all business, you know?
936000	950000	And I can't wait for her to ask what's going on. I'm going to be like, I am a married man. I made love in a lighthouse and I just want the rest of the game to just be about killing werewolves.
950000	961000	Do you think the game is designed for people to like, you know, the first girl I meet, I'm going to date her. She's like the evil part of my mother. You're like, she's hard to please. I'm going to date this, this British lady, like a school marm.
961000	965000	And then you realize, oh, she sucks. And then later on you're supposed to meet the red head.
965000	973000	It's definitely, it's laid out that way. It's pretty ingenious. Like it's kind of, it's very, for a video game, if it was a movie, you'd be like, well, this isn't very smart.
973000	984000	But for a video game, it's pretty sophisticated, like, stuff. The game Dragon Age Origins had some stuff like that. I thought it was pretty, that was pretty fun.
984000	999000	I'm old. I'm playing video games. I like that some of them have like a more nuanced story component to them. But the danger of that is that now I'm, yeah, now it's like the game is about anxiety.
1000000	1010000	Now I can't escape life. I'm like in a worse life. It's like a terrible, I'm like living a lie in the video game.
1010000	1015000	In the real life, I have a beautiful woman bringing me cheeseburgers.
1015000	1020000	You're hanging out with the poo poo phase later.
1020000	1028000	Tess, Tris, Marygold. That's the red, that's the sorceress. You said that was such wishful.
1028000	1036000	Wasn't Tess Marygold? Tris, Tris, Tris. She's Tris. But, you know, Tris.
1036000	1046000	All right. So anyways, oh, you forgot to bring Spencer up. Oh, shit. Yeah, I got mesmerized with the Ty Brixton song. Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
1051000	1053000	Sorry, Spencer.
1059000	1066000	Sorry, Spencer. I was remiss. Don't even trip. That's a great song, man. It's a lot better than me.
1066000	1078000	No, no, no, not like that. I mean, it's really that good of a song. I've been, I've literally just been driving around and I'll be like, I'm singing. I'm like, come, come over here. It's so good.
1081000	1087000	Hey, guys. How far down that gallon of opaque jug of pina colada do you think you are?
1087000	1089000	I don't know. I can't tell.
1089000	1092000	Hey, lick off the whole straw and do like the dipstick test.
1092000	1099000	That's a good idea. That is a bull catheter.
1099000	1104000	Shit. That is some viscous shit.
1104000	1111000	It's really good. I have a perfect wife. I have the perfect wife. She's not here tonight.
1111000	1114000	What is she up to? She's fatigued from cooking for you all day?
1114000	1120000	She's right. She's got a lot of she's got to make. You know, it's our friend Kimber's birthday tomorrow, I think.
1120000	1122000	So she's making some stuff.
1125000	1130000	I think I should switch back to Saturday. This is not good for performance.
1131000	1134000	I feel sluggish and I want the summer heat.
1134000	1140000	I should just go back.
1140000	1142000	Is that a proper pina colada?
1142000	1144000	Oh, yeah, this is pretty standard.
1144000	1146000	Booze to mixer ratio?
1146000	1147000	I don't know. I don't know.
1147000	1148000	It's boozy.
1148000	1149000	It's pretty boozy.
1149000	1152000	Damn, that's a lot of booze, Jackson. I'll try a sip.
1153000	1156000	That's so great. I got to try a sip.
1159000	1161000	I've got a long way to go.
1161000	1163000	What's in a pina colada?
1163000	1165000	I'm not good at alcohol.
1165000	1171000	It's rum, coconut, milk, pineapple and something else.
1171000	1172000	Shit.
1172000	1174000	You like booze and milk?
1174000	1176000	Yeah.
1176000	1177000	Try it Spencer. Come on.
1177000	1178000	No, I'm good.
1178000	1180000	Take a bite off of that sandwich, man. Come on.
1180000	1182000	Do you guys remember the Darwin Awards?
1182000	1186000	There's a guy who won a Darwin Award for trying to make alcohol by mixing beer.
1186000	1190000	No, if he started with beer, that'd be good.
1190000	1195000	No, he was mixing milk with just car gasoline.
1195000	1199000	Because that's how booze is made.
1199000	1201000	And he died from drinking it?
1201000	1202000	Yeah.
1202000	1203000	He drank so much that he died?
1203000	1206000	I mean, I don't know how much you'd have to drink, but yeah.
1206000	1211000	I mean, it might be apocryphal, but when I was in college, do you remember the story of the guy that died?
1211000	1215000	He was doing a headstand and he put a bottle of Jack Daniels up in his butt.
1215000	1219000	And he let the booze drain into his butt and he just died.
1219000	1222000	Yeah, I don't think that was an urban legend. I think that really happened to a guy.
1222000	1225000	He had some serious butt chugging.
1227000	1229000	That's what they call that.
1229000	1233000	That's not some Saturday morning brunch butt chugging.
1233000	1235000	This isn't your grandmother's butt chugging.
1235000	1239000	That's not like a casual mimosa butt chug.
1239000	1253000	Pour down your anal cavity at 45 degree angles by a group of well-meaning friends before going to see a Marvel movie.
1253000	1256000	This is hardcore butt chugging.
1256000	1259000	I would have butt chugged a little bit of that pina colada. That was delicious.
1259000	1262000	Oh, that'd be cold.
1263000	1266000	You want cold. I mean, more than you wouldn't want hot.
1266000	1270000	How come putting stuff in your butt makes it go into your blood faster than putting it into your mouth?
1270000	1275000	I think it's a more closer capillary network to the edge of the skin probably.
1275000	1277000	But that doesn't... Oh, okay.
1277000	1286000	It's not like your skin is like protective tissue. It's designed to prevent absorption, but you're like inner insides or not.
1286000	1289000	So I think that things can just pass into your blood easier.
1289000	1296000	Why wouldn't they save that apparatus for up here as the answer because you don't want that much to get through up here?
1296000	1301000	I think that's the answer. But then again, what's down there is poop.
1301000	1303000	But that's your intestines, right?
1303000	1311000	I think the idea is throughout your entire digestive tract, your body is trying to reabsorb anything that's valuable all the way until the last drop.
1311000	1318000	Yeah, so that's the last resort. That's the ultimate filter back there because that's the last shot you got, man.
1319000	1325000	You know, elephants, you know how everybody goes to the zoo and they see an elephant eat grass out of another elephant's asshole?
1325000	1326000	Oh, yeah.
1326000	1329000	And they always think they saw the craziest thing in the world.
1329000	1334000	But elephant shit is basically just grass. You could eat it. It'd be great.
1334000	1341000	Because they just... Animals that digest cellulose, which we cannot do, if we ate a handful of grass, our stomach would be like, why are you doing that?
1341000	1344000	That might as well be just a house or something.
1344000	1347000	And I'm not a termite.
1347000	1360000	But deer and rabbits and elephants, certain mammals have the enzymes and they can break down cellulose so they can eat grass, whatever that is, basically.
1360000	1367000	But they pass so much of it through. It's such an inefficient engine that their poop is practically edible.
1367000	1369000	They're the original butt-chuggers.
1369000	1371000	They're the opposite of butt-chuggers.
1371000	1373000	Butt-munchers?
1374000	1376000	They're butt-munchers.
1376000	1378000	They're buffet butts.
1378000	1383000	The elephant that's eating the poo out the first elephant, he's a butt-muncher.
1383000	1386000	He's a butt-muncher, yeah.
1386000	1388000	We got that settled?
1388000	1389000	All right.
1389000	1391000	We're getting a lot done tonight.
1391000	1397000	It's a low-energy show. I got a lot of food in my stomach. But we're getting some stuff done.
1397000	1399000	Dorito mac and cheese?
1399000	1401000	That's just mac and cheese with Dorito sprinkles.
1401000	1403000	I mean, you're going to make me puke.
1403000	1406000	Oh, another thing about Witcher 3...
1406000	1409000	Not the Gallon and Pina Colada. I'm going to make you puke.
1409000	1414000	Witcher 3 is like... I didn't mean to... I wasn't decrying it as a sexist game or anything.
1414000	1419000	I just think that in the last five years with the world changing under feet, I don't have a horse in that race.
1419000	1422000	So I'm just going like, oh, those are neat tits.
1422000	1426000	And I think that it's a very enjoyable game for everybody.
1426000	1433000	I was just thinking that one particular area, it's just sort of funny because it takes place in this fantasy world.
1433000	1437000	And it's just like, literally everybody, this is like the equivalent of a receptionist will just come up and go,
1437000	1440000	can I help you? And her shirt will just be unbuttoned to her navel for no reason.
1440000	1442000	It's just like boobs in your face.
1442000	1444000	Is Tris Marigold putting it out there too?
1444000	1450000	She was one of the more tasteful ones, I would say.
1450000	1460000	She wore pants and you could see that she had boobs, but I don't think it was an accident.
1460000	1467000	I was more taken with her magic and her politics.
1467000	1472000	Anyways, I just wanted to say one more thing about Witcher 3.
1472000	1478000	They have strumpets in the game. Can we bring the word strumpets back? That's adorable.
1478000	1484000	I mean, you can't ask men to not be sexist overnight, but maybe if we brought back a word like strumpets,
1484000	1489000	at least we could make us a little more adorable while we're being misogynist.
1489000	1496000	The guy that invented the word strumpet in a fit of misogyny, he must have been so bummed out when it came out of his mouth.
1496000	1502000	He's like, you fucking strumpet. And then the woman is like, I'll take it. That's adorable.
1502000	1506000	And he's like, god damn it.
1506000	1514000	Strumpet. Well, it sounds like trumpet and crumpet.
1514000	1524000	You got no arguments for me on that one?
1524000	1530000	Let's do a new segment called Boring News.
1531000	1538000	So far, we have not been doing that.
1538000	1552000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, what's happening?
1552000	1555000	That was a boring rap. I like that beat. Can you do that?
1555000	1557000	You want to bring it back? Let's do it.
1557000	1559000	Spencer, this is Kevin McLeod. Spencer said this to me.
1559000	1561000	I found this one.
1561000	1563000	From the tippy top.
1563000	1567000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, slow rapping.
1567000	1571000	Yo, yo, scary, scary neighborhood.
1571000	1575000	Yo, yo, driving down a spooky street.
1575000	1579000	Yo, Halloween, look at all the costumes.
1579000	1583000	Trick or treat, motherfucker.
1584000	1587000	That girl's dressed like a pumpkin.
1587000	1590000	I hope she gets a lot of candy.
1590000	1593000	Roll down the window, look at my foot.
1593000	1596000	Okay, fuck that, fuck that.
1596000	1598000	I think that'll work like this.
1598000	1601000	I think, yeah.
1601000	1605000	I only listened to the first, about the first eight bars of that one, Spencer.
1605000	1607000	Sorry, that's a corrupt violin.
1607000	1609000	Yeah, is that a bad... Sorry, man.
1609000	1612000	That was the one off of the YouTube. I clicked the link, it downloaded right to the thing.
1612000	1615000	I used that YouTube link all the time, so I don't know, I don't know.
1615000	1617000	Sorry, everybody.
1617000	1619000	Everybody get your shit together.
1619000	1621000	This is not what the people pay us for.
1621000	1623000	All right, so this is... Okay, one more time.
1623000	1626000	I can play it off the YouTube that he sent me.
1626000	1628000	Boring news segment. Boring news segment.
1628000	1630000	Boring news segment.
1630000	1633000	Are we going to do this theme again?
1633000	1634000	You want the same one?
1634000	1635000	Yeah.
1635000	1636000	The wonky one that we just did?
1636000	1637000	Yeah.
1637000	1638000	All right.
1638000	1641000	Yeah, yeah.
1641000	1644000	What's happening?
1644000	1649000	Ain't always entertaining.
1649000	1652000	Sometimes it's boring.
1652000	1655000	Nothing much happened.
1655000	1659000	Boring news. Boring news.
1659000	1662000	Okay.
1662000	1671000	We got a new saltwater aquarium installed in our home.
1671000	1673000	Go on.
1673000	1680000	These, in order, are my 10 picks for our fish.
1680000	1685000	Dan, I'm going to stop you there. This is called boring news.
1685000	1688000	My top pick is the blue spotted jaw fish.
1688000	1691000	Look it up, you'll see why.
1691000	1693000	Tell me why, because I don't have the option.
1693000	1697000	It's like a little snake guy and he can make a little hole in the sand
1697000	1701000	and act like a snake sometimes.
1701000	1703000	How large are these fish we're talking about?
1703000	1705000	How big is the aquarium? Is it a giant one or a smaller one?
1705000	1709000	I don't know. It's an aquarium size.
1709000	1712000	Somewhere between 50 and 1,000 gallons.
1712000	1713000	It's a decent size one.
1713000	1717000	You wouldn't call it big, but it's certainly good sized.
1717000	1719000	We'll get extra little fish.
1720000	1723000	Number two, the yellow watchman goby.
1723000	1727000	Nothing really to say about him. I can't remember anything about him.
1727000	1731000	Number three, the court jester goby.
1731000	1733000	Why is he playing second fiddle to the other goby?
1733000	1736000	I don't know. I can't remember.
1736000	1739000	Number four, the lawnmower blenny.
1739000	1742000	I think I remember him. He scoots along with dirt.
1742000	1746000	Number five, Jeff, you're going to like this one.
1746000	1749000	Blue tang.
1749000	1753000	Yeah.
1753000	1758000	Some of that smurf pussy.
1758000	1761000	Number six, the health freaky dark fish.
1761000	1763000	They're making these up. These aren't real fish.
1763000	1767000	That one I got just because it reminded me of the Diane word song.
1767000	1771000	I think health freaky and I like you a lot.
1771000	1774000	Number seven, I can't remember the name,
1774000	1779000	but Aaron and I called it the pajama buscemi cardinal fish.
1779000	1782000	Because it reminded us of Steve Buscemi.
1782000	1787000	Number eight, the royal grandma. I know, typical.
1787000	1790000	Number nine, the bang guy cardinal.
1790000	1794000	Number 10, the Bartlett antheus.
1794000	1796000	I mean, that's one.
1796000	1798000	That one can go fuck itself. It's number 10.
1798000	1801000	Give me the 30 fish that didn't make the cut.
1801000	1805000	I don't know. There's a bunch of blennies and grandmas that don't make it.
1805000	1808000	Are you going to combine these fish? Are you going to pick one sort of fish?
1808000	1813000	Well, we'll defer to our aquarium guy who, you know, he'll go,
1813000	1816000	oh, a blenny will eat a goby.
1816000	1819000	You've been with me too, Damon's and Glenda, right?
1819000	1822000	That tiki place, the bar. They had to make the chi-chis.
1822000	1824000	Yeah, they got some aquariums in there.
1824000	1826000	Yeah, they have a bunch of aquariums.
1826000	1828000	I grew up with fish in aquariums. I liked him as a kid.
1828000	1831000	But there was one fish that takes dirt and sucks it up in his mouth.
1831000	1833000	And he goes and makes little towers over here.
1833000	1835000	And he makes a little building of dirt over here or gravel.
1835000	1837000	That's one of these guys. I can't remember.
1837000	1839000	That's maybe the blue snakey guy.
1839000	1841000	And then he sucks it up and then he gets bored with that shit
1841000	1842000	and starts making one over there.
1842000	1844000	And the other fish are just swimming around looking at you.
1844000	1848000	They're doing nothing. This guy's working for a living.
1848000	1851000	Saltwater tanks are very meticulous. You know, they're hard to maintain.
1851000	1854000	So we got, you know, they're taking it step by step.
1854000	1856000	They got to put living rock in it.
1856000	1859000	Then they put some coral in it later.
1859000	1862000	But first they brought in three starter fish.
1862000	1866000	Yeah, that's how you got to do it.
1866000	1868000	That sounds like a shitty gig. What do they have to do?
1868000	1870000	They start the water off?
1870000	1872000	Yeah, well Dino and I spent like 45 minutes
1872000	1874000	like disagreeing on what the Pixar movie would be,
1874000	1877000	like about starter fish.
1877000	1880000	Because Dino, I wish he was here to like defend his movie,
1880000	1883000	but I was like, you don't get it. You just don't get it.
1883000	1886000	Because he was like, he was obsessed with this idea
1886000	1889000	that it would be the story of a starter fish's relationship
1889000	1891000	with the little girl who got the aquarium,
1891000	1894000	but her parents kept telling her don't get attached to him.
1894000	1897000	He's just a starter fish. Like he's going to die.
1897000	1901000	And I was like, dude, your narrative's all over the fucking place.
1901000	1904000	And he's like, you said the toy story. I said, yeah, exactly.
1904000	1907000	Andy's a fucking meteorological phenomenon. He's moving.
1907000	1909000	He likes this toy. He doesn't like that toy.
1909000	1912000	The toys are the ones with the fucking complicated relationships.
1912000	1915000	You can't bounce back and forth in and out of the tank.
1915000	1919000	The grown-ups talking to a kid and going like, don't get attached to her.
1919000	1922000	What the fuck is he talking about?
1922000	1923000	What's your opening?
1923000	1926000	I'm glad you asked.
1926000	1929000	Obviously, I mean, I don't even know that you have a choice in this matter.
1929000	1932000	If it's a movie called starter fish, it's like, hey, we're starter fish.
1932000	1934000	We're like the blue collar fish.
1934000	1938000	You know, we go into the tank and we can handle heartier water
1938000	1940000	and we get things started.
1940000	1944000	And we know that we do a good job when the big, bright fish come in
1944000	1948000	who are more sensitive and delicate and who cost more money.
1948000	1950000	And they're the reason that people get the tank.
1950000	1951000	I'm sorry. I spit all over you.
1951000	1952000	Hit pause for a second.
1952000	1955000	So the starter fish's job is to what?
1955000	1956000	They're just in there because they're cheap.
1956000	1958000	And if they die, it's not as big a deal.
1958000	1961000	Oh, you're making sure you got the levels in the same thing.
1961000	1963000	They actually set the levels themselves.
1963000	1964000	It's like they shit.
1964000	1968000	And then like bacteria and stuff can grow in the carbon
1968000	1970000	and the living material they put out.
1970000	1973000	And that actually puts bacteria in the water that, you know,
1973000	1976000	then that bacteria eats and puts air into the water.
1976000	1977000	And they can breathe.
1977000	1979000	They jumpstart the biosphere.
1979000	1982000	They should call them martyr fish.
1982000	1984000	Anyways, obviously my story...
1984000	1986000	That's the name of your movie, Martyr Fish.
1986000	1988000	Well, I think someone could throw that out at one point
1988000	1990000	and go, why don't they call you Martyr Fish?
1990000	1992000	Maybe. That could be like a thing in Act One, I guess.
1992000	1996000	It's in the trailer for sure.
1996000	1999000	My movie's about the little starter fish that decides
1999000	2001000	he wants to be the center of attention.
2001000	2003000	He's not a starter fish.
2003000	2006000	He's going to be the most important fish in the tank.
2006000	2008000	And then everyone's like, look at that fish.
2008000	2010000	And all the...
2010000	2013000	You know, you don't set the story outside the aquarium.
2013000	2014000	You have all the other fish.
2014000	2016000	You're like, what the fuck are you doing, starter fish?
2016000	2018000	The other fish is saying, look, don't get too big for your boots.
2018000	2020000	You know where we're going.
2020000	2022000	We're going right down the toilet.
2022000	2025000	See, you and Dino are obsessed with this lifespan thing.
2025000	2027000	That's the thing.
2027000	2029000	Wouldn't there be threshold guardian starter fish
2029000	2031000	or they would all go get him?
2031000	2032000	No, no, I think yes.
2032000	2034000	Of course, he would have his family would be like,
2034000	2037000	don't, don't, Mickey.
2037000	2039000	You're a starter fish.
2039000	2040000	Now, I don't know why.
2040000	2042000	I've got to finish writing the movie.
2042000	2046000	But I don't know what's at stake for anybody.
2046000	2048000	Because they're in a tank.
2048000	2050000	So I don't know.
2050000	2052000	Maybe there's a fish contest at the end of the movie.
2052000	2053000	I don't know.
2053000	2055000	I'll work on it later.
2055000	2057000	How does he go from being a starter fish
2057000	2061000	to making the cut for these flashy or pajamas,
2061000	2063000	buchemis and stuff like that when they come in?
2063000	2064000	Well, I don't know.
2064000	2066000	OK, I'm just riffing this, OK?
2066000	2067000	Bad pitch.
2067000	2070000	OK, Tommy the starter fish comes in and they go,
2070000	2071000	kid, you're a starter fish.
2071000	2073000	Do you know the code of starter fish?
2073000	2074000	No, I don't.
2074000	2075000	Really, you're telling the audience.
2075000	2077000	You tell them, huh?
2077000	2078000	It's a starter fish.
2078000	2079000	This is our code of ethics.
2079000	2080000	OK, starter fish.
2080000	2082000	OK, here come all the fucked up fish.
2083000	2084000	Non-fucked up fish.
2084000	2086000	And then, OK, so it's a love story.
2086000	2089000	He falls for a girl.
2089000	2090000	You know what?
2090000	2092000	Maybe it needs to take place in the aquarium store
2092000	2093000	in order for it to work.
2093000	2095000	Because then there's that whole adoption thing.
2095000	2096000	Where are you going to go?
2096000	2097000	That's what it has to be.
2097000	2098000	All right.
2098000	2102000	It's like, oh, he falls in love with a tetra
2102000	2105000	or a blue tang, probably.
2105000	2106000	Yeah.
2107000	2111000	And then, or just wants to be friends.
2111000	2113000	It doesn't have to be falls in love.
2113000	2115000	Because some people might go, they can't reproduce.
2115000	2116000	Are they going to?
2116000	2120000	You're like, why do you want to think about this fish fucking?
2120000	2122000	And then, so then, but then he's like,
2122000	2123000	I want to go with her.
2123000	2124000	So I'm going to go.
2124000	2126000	So he's just in a tank full of starter fish.
2126000	2130000	So then he, what do you do when you're just a kid born
2130000	2132000	on, born off Broadway?
2132000	2133000	But you got big dreams.
2136000	2142000	So he starts flashing around.
2142000	2144000	It's like a subtle, if you do it right,
2144000	2151000	it could be like a subtle commentary for drag queens.
2151000	2154000	Like he decides, I want to be flashy.
2154000	2156000	And then people are like, you're weird.
2156000	2157000	Stop it.
2157000	2158000	That's not in your nature.
2158000	2159000	You're a starter fish.
2159000	2161000	And he's like, so what?
2161000	2163000	That's what I was born.
2163000	2164000	I don't care.
2164000	2167000	I want to be a different kind of fish and get scooped out of here.
2167000	2175000	And I'm going to go beyond the metaphor for whatever RuPaul show,
2175000	2178000	which is going into some little girl's tank in her bedroom.
2183000	2186000	What's the bottoming out of that?
2186000	2190000	What's the Randy Newman theme song?
2190000	2191000	I guess so.
2191000	2194000	Because I got a thing for you.
2194000	2197000	No, no, no.
2197000	2200000	It's terrible songs where he's just talking.
2200000	2206000	Oh, swimming water, water, swimming, friend.
2206000	2211000	It's not a song just because there's a piano in the background.
2211000	2212000	All right.
2212000	2216000	So next week, we're not here because we're
2216000	2218000	doing the Rick and Morty premiere party.
2218000	2219000	It premieres on Sunday.
2224000	2228000	Apparently, I've been asked to host the streaming of the thing.
2228000	2229000	Yeah.
2229000	2231000	You're helping us out there at the party.
2231000	2234000	I should probably get to see the episode before that happens, right?
2234000	2236000	That's why I know what the hell I'm talking about.
2236000	2238000	Yeah.
2238000	2239000	Yeah.
2239000	2240000	Yeah.
2240000	2242000	It could be a disaster.
2242000	2245000	Because you'd be like, what are you going to see?
2245000	2247000	I don't even know what you're going to be doing.
2248000	2250000	Then the week after that, it gets more confusing.
2250000	2252000	We're going to be in New York.
2252000	2253000	Right?
2253000	2254000	Is that right?
2254000	2255000	We are both.
2255000	2256000	Yes.
2256000	2258000	That show's already sold out because it's in a teeny little theater.
2258000	2260000	Not that you guys were going to fly to New York to see us,
2260000	2264000	but for those of you listening to New York.
2264000	2269000	And then we're back here and we're rolling like James Brolin.
2269000	2282000	Is there anybody here that's lactose intolerant?
2282000	2284000	There's got to be.
2284000	2285000	Yes.
2285000	2286000	Okay.
2286000	2290000	So I'm going to ask you a couple yes or no questions.
2290000	2291000	You fart a lot when you...
2291000	2292000	Yes.
2292000	2293000	Okay.
2296000	2297000	Does it hurt?
2297000	2298000	Yes.
2298000	2299000	Okay.
2299000	2304000	So it's just like if you just had a cheeseburger.
2304000	2305000	Worth it.
2310000	2315000	So is it possible that I could have been lactose intolerant my whole life
2315000	2319000	and I'm just now noticing because I fart so much?
2319000	2320000	What did you say?
2320000	2322000	You shart yourself a lot.
2322000	2323000	Shart yourself?
2323000	2325000	What are you, British?
2326000	2329000	You do poop your pants a lot.
2329000	2333000	Well, yeah, but that's alcoholism.
2335000	2336000	I'm a drunk too.
2336000	2337000	I don't poop my pants ever.
2337000	2338000	Well, it could be a combination.
2338000	2340000	Like if I'm drunk and eating a lot of dairy,
2340000	2345000	then I'm like farting so much that my inhibitions and judgment are lowered
2345000	2347000	so that I'm like, here comes a great fart.
2347000	2350000	And like, I don't realize.
2350000	2352000	Now, have you ever pooped your pants sober?
2352000	2353000	Let's figure this out.
2353000	2354000	Well, I don't know.
2354000	2358000	Yeah, I have because I remember in comedy sports,
2358000	2362000	I remember at the Marriott Hotel, I went up to...
2362000	2363000	In Milwaukee?
2363000	2366000	Yeah, I remember very distinctly because like Dick Chudnow,
2366000	2369000	the founder of comedy sports was like setting up the stage
2369000	2371000	and he said something like,
2371000	2375000	I wonder if we should play this game or that game tonight or whatever.
2375000	2379000	And I said, well, you know, Dick, I felt like a fart coming.
2379000	2383000	And I said, well, you know a real crowd pleaser
2383000	2385000	is if we...
2385000	2388000	And I just shit in my pants.
2388000	2391000	There was no sound.
2391000	2393000	It was just...
2398000	2400000	And I just walked away.
2400000	2403000	I had to throw my pants and my underwear in the garbage.
2403000	2405000	I was like, I had no pants.
2405000	2408000	Like I had to borrow someone else's pants and they knew.
2408000	2409000	That's not like I took a shower.
2409000	2412000	It's like, so they knew that they then were gonna have to throw their pants away too.
2413000	2414000	Did they know what happened?
2414000	2415000	They just...
2415000	2416000	Everyone knew.
2416000	2417000	There was no way I was gonna like...
2417000	2420000	I'm not gonna let that be a secret.
2420000	2422000	Then that's just more humiliation.
2422000	2427000	Like as soon as that shit starts, I'm like, I'm going to ground zero away.
2427000	2429000	Jeff Khan, whatever.
2429000	2431000	I'm not gonna let somebody go.
2431000	2433000	Dan shit his pants.
2433000	2437000	I was on stage in LA with a guy, one of the dudes in our show,
2437000	2438000	who was the referee.
2438000	2439000	Right before...
2439000	2441000	Like instead of intermission, it was called halftime.
2441000	2444000	And all of a sudden, it smelled like somebody shit their pants.
2444000	2449000	And certainly enough, our referee had just completely filled his pants.
2449000	2453000	And so he came back out at halftime for the second act.
2453000	2457000	And instead of having black trousers on, like he'd had to start the thing,
2457000	2461000	now he had like navy blue or royal blue sweatpants, but no underwear on.
2461000	2464000	So you could see his little wiener, like floating through there.
2464000	2465000	And it was mesmerizing.
2465000	2467000	He'd talk over here and his wiener would go over here.
2467000	2469000	He'd talk over there and his wiener would go...
2471000	2473000	I know who that guy is.
2473000	2475000	I wanted to mention his name so bad.
2475000	2478000	There was this kid named Noah in my grade school, Noah.
2478000	2481000	I can't remember his last name or boy, I'd tell you.
2481000	2483000	But I remember his first name was Noah.
2483000	2486000	And he was, by his own account, he was allergic to cheese.
2486000	2490000	So I think we just didn't know it was called lactose intolerance back then.
2490000	2492000	But he said, I'm allergic to cheese.
2492000	2493000	And we go, what do you mean?
2493000	2495000	Like you sneeze when you eat it?
2495000	2499000	And he's like, no, I shit my pants.
2499000	2503000	But then it was like, you know, it was the 80s and it was a public school.
2503000	2507000	So he would take a dollar to eat cheese.
2507000	2510000	People would give him a dollar and he'd go like, really? A dollar?
2510000	2515000	He had some witnesses.
2515000	2517000	I'm like, poops, temporary.
2517000	2522000	Money's forever.
2522000	2523000	I wish that were true, Dan.
2523000	2525000	My pants will be clean tomorrow.
2525000	2528000	Yeah, but it's going to cost a dollar to wash them.
2528000	2530000	Yes, tomorrow, my pants will be clean.
2530000	2533000	But I shall be rich.
2533000	2538000	And I remember, I remember one time he shit his pants in the cafeteria.
2538000	2540000	What age are we talking? I'm sorry.
2540000	2541000	No, it wasn't him.
2541000	2543000	I mean, Noah would shit his pants all the time.
2543000	2546000	But he did it on purpose.
2546000	2547000	And then I think he'd just go home.
2547000	2552000	And I think he would just like whistle the theme from the Andy Griffith show.
2552000	2556000	I guess he was the kid that was nailing it, right?
2556000	2559000	It was like, I shit my pants when I eat cheese.
2559000	2563000	I'll give you a dollar to do that, okay?
2563000	2566000	Goodbye, school.
2566000	2568000	Hello, dollar?
2568000	2570000	I have to go do two things.
2570000	2577000	I have to go do some laundry and go to the bank.
2577000	2581000	But there was this kid, I can't remember his name.
2581000	2585000	I wish you could, because the names of your friends from school are hilarious.
2585000	2590000	I want to, okay, I want to say his, I do remember his name.
2590000	2591000	And I remember his full name.
2591000	2592000	His first name was Henry.
2592000	2596000	I want to say his last name because it's adorable, but it's alliterative.
2596000	2601000	But he was an adorable, very quiet kid, and he shit his pants.
2601000	2606000	And for some reason, for some reason, this is what's really weird.
2606000	2611000	This would have been first grade, not kindergarten.
2612000	2617000	In kindergarten, I told you the story of how, in kindergarten, you don't even know where you're going.
2617000	2622000	They used to take me to that special room when I was in kindergarten because I knew how to read.
2622000	2624000	They left me in this room.
2624000	2626000	I didn't know how to read the clock.
2626000	2628000	As you told the story before?
2628000	2632000	Yeah, I know when the bell rings, I get to go to the bathroom.
2632000	2635000	But I don't know what time it is, and I don't know when the bell's going to ring.
2635000	2637000	And I had to pee.
2637000	2641000	In the chair, I just sit in the middle of this walk-in closet surrounded by textbooks.
2641000	2644000	And I just went, ah, psss.
2644000	2648000	And right in the middle of it, it was like, brr-ring the bell.
2648000	2651000	And I was just like, psss.
2651000	2653000	I just kept going.
2653000	2658000	And then I just got up and took a look back, and there was this big ocean of pee,
2658000	2661000	and I just hit the lights on the left.
2661000	2663000	I just pissed all down my pants.
2663000	2666000	I went and got in the lunch line thinking, like, oh, yeah, no one will notice.
2666000	2672000	You look like you were riding a painted horse that hadn't dried yet.
2672000	2674000	Of course people are going to notice.
2674000	2677000	And the guy who really pointed out, my brother, who was in sixth grade at the time,
2677000	2679000	was like, did you piss your pants?
2679000	2681000	And the whole school was like, you pissed your pants.
2681000	2684000	Anyways, when I was in first grade...
2684000	2686000	Did you cry? Was that horrible?
2686000	2691000	I think that was so weird that I don't think I cried.
2691000	2693000	I've cried it less.
2694000	2697000	Did you realize you could have been making money on this the whole time?
2697000	2700000	You could have been peeing your pants for a dollar a pop.
2700000	2702000	So this kid, Henry...
2702000	2709000	So Miss Piana comes up to me at lunch, first grade, and she goes...
2709000	2712000	She's got Henry. She's holding his hand.
2712000	2716000	And she goes, Daniel, will you take Henry to the bathroom?
2716000	2718000	He had an accident.
2718000	2721000	Now, I never shit my pants in school, as far as I know.
2721000	2722000	So I don't know why I'm an expert.
2722000	2724000	Send him with Noah, you know?
2724000	2726000	Noah, I'll show him the ropes.
2727000	2730000	Maybe that's what she was worried about.
2731000	2734000	Would that mean another poop tycoon in our school?
2734000	2739000	I think it was because I was the smart kid I was supposed to handle.
2739000	2745000	Or that you dealt with the trauma of peeing yourself so well that you thought, I can take it.
2745000	2750000	Yeah, I remember going into the coat room where the bathrooms were
2750000	2753000	and he just went into a stall, and I was just kind of like...
2753000	2754000	I have such a clear memory of that.
2754000	2759000	Like, I was just hanging out by the winter coats, just kind of like trying to talk him through it,
2759000	2762000	like an old war buddy or something.
2762000	2764000	I was like, I poop my pants all the time.
2764000	2766000	Uh-huh, okay.
2766000	2769000	Oh, man, it's everywhere. It's all right. It's okay, man.
2769000	2772000	Just clean it up.
2775000	2777000	I don't know what I was supposed to do.
2777000	2779000	That's so weird.
2780000	2784000	It's a positive memory for me, though, because I felt like I did it right, but I'm sure I didn't.
2784000	2787000	I don't know. I'm sure I wasn't supposed to help him.
2787000	2790000	That would be crazy if the teacher wanted me to help.
2791000	2792000	She couldn't have wanted that.
2792000	2796000	Yeah, how would she have judged the success of that task?
2797000	2800000	What was she hoping would happen?
2800000	2803000	Usually you go to the nurse or they call a parent or something, right?
2803000	2805000	I guess this was in the past.
2805000	2808000	Yeah, this was like in dinosaur times.
2808000	2812000	There were probably just as many pedophiles and kidnappings,
2812000	2814000	but there was no internet yet.
2814000	2817000	So it was just sort of like, well, as long as he's with someone,
2817000	2820000	we can't just send him off into the world.
2820000	2823000	We'll send him with two kids so they'll be harder to kidnap.
2823000	2826000	We had beatings in my elementary school.
2826000	2828000	Like you got corporal punishment.
2828000	2831000	There were hard spankings at our school.
2831000	2832000	I don't think we ever...
2832000	2833000	That's hilarious.
2833000	2835000	For our birthdays there were.
2836000	2838000	We got paddled for our birthdays.
2839000	2841000	You could hear kids getting spanked if someone did something bad.
2841000	2842000	I feel like I've told the story before,
2842000	2844000	but there was a ping-pong paddle supposedly,
2844000	2846000	and they really whacked the crap out of you.
2846000	2850000	Not quite, but you could hear it from outside the building.
2850000	2851000	And so you'd be in there.
2851000	2855000	It was like a scene from some World War II prisoner movie,
2855000	2857000	and you could hear the kids scream and you wham.
2857000	2859000	This is the fucking worst.
2860000	2862000	And then supposedly the legend was
2862000	2864000	there was one kid that was so badass,
2864000	2867000	he clenched up his butt cheeks and broke the ping-pong paddle.
2870000	2872000	The kid was famous whether or not that had ever happened,
2872000	2874000	but he was like he was Paul Bunyan.
2875000	2877000	His ass was so muscular.
2877000	2879000	He just fought it so hard.
2879000	2882000	He just fucking destroyed a ping-pong paddle.
2883000	2885000	Well, my mom would hit us with a wooden spoon,
2885000	2887000	and every once in a while the wooden spoon would break.
2887000	2889000	Oh yeah, I'm sure that there was stress crack.
2889000	2890000	There was fatigue.
2890000	2891000	I hate that that kid got credit for...
2892000	2894000	Because it's like if you just hit a rock with a ping-pong paddle,
2894000	2895000	it's not going to break.
2895000	2897000	It's not like because it's so hard.
2899000	2902000	Someone else's ass wore that thing out for him.
2903000	2904000	Yeah, where's their credit?
2906000	2909000	No, I don't think anybody got...
2909000	2910000	They call those starter butts.
2921000	2922000	That's it.
2927000	2930000	I'm trying to remember even like maybe before,
2930000	2932000	because my brother was five years ahead of me,
2932000	2933000	so like any stories about...
2933000	2936000	I hear stories about teachers throwing erasers
2936000	2939000	and throwing chalk and throwing tantrums and stuff.
2939000	2943000	Yeah, there were teachers who would have like nervous breakdowns,
2943000	2946000	but then they would disappear because they did something physical.
2946000	2947000	We had a crazy teacher that locked...
2947000	2950000	If you made her mad, she was kind of like on and off medication,
2951000	2952000	and if she was off her medication,
2952000	2954000	she would just lock kids in a cabinet.
2955000	2956000	That was the punishment.
2956000	2957000	Then people...
2957000	2958000	She got fired for that, of course.
2958000	2959000	We found out about that.
2959000	2960000	But suddenly she would go like,
2961000	2963000	Mr. Davis, get out of here.
2963000	2965000	You've disrupted the class too many times.
2965000	2968000	You go run around the school.
2968000	2969000	Now, our school was enormous.
2969000	2971000	It would take you the rest of the day,
2971000	2973000	so I just went to my car and went home.
2974000	2975000	Then we found that out,
2975000	2976000	so we would just try to piss her off
2976000	2977000	and she would go take a lap.
2977000	2980000	Then we would just go to, like, Dierwiner schnitzel.
2983000	2985000	I almost died at a Dierwiner schnitzel at lunch, by the way.
2985000	2987000	The guy was taking a bite of a corn dog,
2987000	2989000	and my friend John, while I was taking a bite of his corn dog,
2989000	2992000	he just thought it would be funny if he gave me more than I wanted,
2992000	2994000	and he'd shoved the entire corn dog down my mouth.
2994000	2995000	But before I knew what was happening,
2995000	2997000	I had bitten the corn dog off.
2997000	3000000	Now I've got an entire corn dog in my throat,
3000000	3002000	and it's not going to come back out.
3002000	3005000	There's no way to get a handle on the corn dog with your mouth,
3005000	3007000	and I'm just going, I'm dying here.
3007000	3009000	And then everybody looked at me and realized that I was dying,
3009000	3011000	and everybody froze.
3011000	3015000	And so then one big strong friend of mine we called Bam Bam,
3015000	3018000	he just came up and picked me upside down, shook me by my ankle.
3022000	3024000	But I digress.
3025000	3027000	I do remember thinking in that moment of crisis,
3027000	3028000	when I thought, okay, I can't breathe.
3028000	3029000	It's been a while now.
3029000	3031000	I need to start breathing soon.
3031000	3032000	There's nothing I can do to help this thing out.
3032000	3033000	It will not go down.
3033000	3034000	It's not going to come out.
3034000	3037000	And I remember thinking, not like this.
3037000	3038000	Oh, man.
3038000	3041000	Well, did you notice, like, so everybody in this room
3041000	3043000	probably has had, like, a choking incident
3043000	3045000	where you actually, like, you kind of, like,
3045000	3048000	it triggers this very specific response in your brain.
3048000	3052000	Like, you feel like this could be it.
3052000	3055000	And it takes very little for that to get triggered,
3055000	3058000	because you're like, oh, my God, I didn't realize
3058000	3061000	how accustomed I am to breathing whenever I want.
3062000	3064000	And it's weird how, number one,
3064000	3066000	how everyone around you kind of freezes,
3066000	3067000	and I've been that guy.
3067000	3070000	Dino and I were eating at Little Dom's
3070000	3074000	with our newly hired CFO at the time.
3074000	3076000	He was just having dinner with him
3076000	3078000	to talk about how excited we were for him
3078000	3081000	to be turning the company around, our animation studio.
3081000	3083000	And he's like, yeah, and it's going to be great.
3083000	3085000	And he's eating this, you know, the hanger steak.
3085000	3087000	And he's just like, yeah, I'm really excited about it.
3087000	3089000	And I can't wait to get some health plans
3090000	3091000	for the staffers.
3091000	3093000	And I'm like, yeah, and morale could be higher
3093000	3094000	over the animation thing,
3094000	3096000	and we could kind of fix that air conditioning.
3096000	3097000	And he's like, yeah.
3097000	3098000	And I really went home.
3099000	3101000	And Dino and I were kind of like...
3104000	3105000	Like, it's weird.
3105000	3107000	Like, I don't know...
3109000	3112000	You're supposed to overreact to possible jokes.
3112000	3114000	The bartender did.
3114000	3117000	Like, he was coming around soon enough
3117000	3120000	that before Dino and I started to do the right thing,
3120000	3122000	he was already over there.
3122000	3123000	Plus, on top of it,
3123000	3125000	by the time anybody got close to him,
3125000	3128000	he just came out onto the floor
3128000	3132000	and he picked it up with a napkin
3132000	3133000	and continued the conversation.
3133000	3135000	But we were all sort of like,
3135000	3138000	oh, we can never unlive that experience.
3139000	3142000	I just might have just watched a guy die, I guess.
3142000	3143000	I don't know what I would have done
3143000	3144000	and when I would have done it.
3144000	3146000	And the other weird thing is that
3146000	3148000	on the choking side,
3148000	3151000	the instinct very often is to hide.
3151000	3153000	People die because they start to choke
3153000	3155000	and then they go to the bathroom
3155000	3156000	because they're embarrassed.
3156000	3159000	And I've been in that situation.
3159000	3162000	It is weird how much shame gets triggered
3162000	3163000	because you're choking.
3163000	3165000	And I guess because you maybe...
3165000	3167000	You feel like a pig or something?
3167000	3169000	You just feel like,
3169000	3170000	well, what's inside your body
3170000	3172000	shouldn't be anyone's business or something.
3172000	3175000	So you just kind of want to go hide somewhere
3175000	3178000	until it's over, which could kill you for sure.
3178000	3180000	For me, I thought, I'll handle this.
3180000	3182000	Let me get this corn dog out of my mouth.
3182000	3183000	And at some point, I'm dying
3183000	3185000	and I need somebody else's help here.
3185000	3187000	By that time, I kept waving everybody off, I think.
3187000	3190000	So everybody was in stasis the whole time.
3190000	3191000	Yeah.
3191000	3192000	I mean, in the 70s,
3192000	3195000	they had that whole Heimlich awareness campaign.
3195000	3198000	It must have just been terrible.
3198000	3200000	It must have happened all the time.
3200000	3202000	People just eating in a restaurant
3202000	3203000	and then they just turned blue
3203000	3204000	and everyone's just going,
3204000	3207000	oh, no, Harold.
3207000	3209000	And they just watch them die.
3209000	3210000	That would be like...
3210000	3211000	I don't have tattoos,
3211000	3212000	and I don't want any,
3212000	3216000	but CPR diagram and Heimlich maneuver diagram.
3216000	3217000	So if you're choking,
3217000	3219000	just rip over in your shirt and lean.
3219000	3222000	You know, there's a trick for the CPR
3222000	3224000	because you know you do chest compressions, right?
3224000	3227000	But you got to do it like a special rhythm.
3227000	3229000	The rhythm is the beat of the song,
3229000	3232000	Stayin' Alive, the disco song.
3232000	3234000	So when you compress, you go, pump.
3234000	3238000	You go, ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
3238000	3239000	Oh, you don't stop for the thing?
3239000	3240000	No, to the beat, you know.
3240000	3243000	Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.
3243000	3244000	You just keep pumpin'.
3244000	3245000	But couldn't that also be,
3245000	3249000	I want to fuck you like an animal.
3249000	3250000	I want to...
3250000	3254000	Just hear those sleigh bells, you go...
3254000	3255000	I guess they picked one that says,
3255000	3257000	Stayin' Alive, it's also a ground booster.
3257000	3259000	Yeah, yeah.
3259000	3261000	I think it makes people excited to know,
3261000	3263000	to know something.
3263000	3265000	It made me excited.
3265000	3268000	We are the world.
3268000	3271000	We are the children.
3271000	3274000	I mean, just pump their chest.
3274000	3277000	If it helps, pretend it's a song.
3281000	3284000	Fuck the police, cut the ground for the minute.
3285000	3298000	Will you know my name, if I see you in heaven?
3298000	3299000	Oh, no.
3299000	3302000	No, not the Eric Clapton...
3302000	3306000	It's also too slow tempo, it's too slow.
3306000	3310000	All right, well, back to this farting thing.
3310000	3312000	So I'm lactose intolerant, for sure, I think,
3312000	3315000	because when I'm eating beans and stuff,
3315000	3317000	I fart like regular people that eat beans.
3317000	3320000	It's a musical fruit, as you know.
3320000	3322000	But it's a predictable amount of bean farting.
3322000	3328000	But then, if I have a pint of ice cream or dairy,
3328000	3332000	I'm capable of generating so much,
3332000	3334000	there must just be some incredible thing happening.
3334000	3337000	Have you tried cutting out all dairy just to see if that goes away?
3337000	3339000	Well, I effectively have with this...
3339000	3341000	Yes, that's what I'm telling you.
3341000	3346000	It took me 42 years to accidentally have that experiment.
3346000	3348000	I never tried it.
3348000	3351000	But today you had a load of dairy, right?
3351000	3355000	I'm saying, today you're farting because of that.
3355000	3357000	But when you cut it out, that stops.
3357000	3359000	Yes, for the rest of the week, it's not there.
3359000	3361000	But then it's like, oh, and then I have some ice cream
3361000	3363000	or a piña colada or something.
3363000	3365000	And then it's like, holy jamole.
3365000	3368000	I feel like I could fill a hot air balloon.
3368000	3373000	And there might be a way to tap it for global energy.
3373000	3377000	It just seems like an amazing thing that a human being could generate so much.
3377000	3381000	We could at least have our own hot air balloon.
3381000	3384000	My friend Sam, he was my neighbor, he had this lovely family.
3384000	3388000	They were a very cohesive nuclear family.
3388000	3392000	The family joke was cherries made them all fart like mad.
3392000	3393000	So they would all...
3393000	3395000	You go to their house and they would put on a bowl of cherries
3395000	3397000	and they all started laughing.
3397000	3399000	So I was eating cherries and they were laughing.
3399000	3404000	Mom, dad, like old people, young people, everyone was just farting.
3404000	3405000	Cherries.
3405000	3408000	I don't like that story.
3408000	3410000	I don't know why, I don't know why.
3410000	3414000	Their pastime is to invite guests over and just fart all over the place.
3414000	3418000	I guess because it's a family, I guess that's what I don't like about it.
3418000	3421000	You resent that the family bonded over anything?
3421000	3425000	It's like the hills have eyes, kind of.
3425000	3428000	Yeah, except they don't because if the hills had eyes,
3428000	3433000	some of those eyes would lend to self-awareness.
3433000	3438000	If the hills had enough eyes, the hills could see themselves for what they were.
3438000	3439000	And that family can't.
3439000	3441000	So you weren't upset about family farting.
3441000	3447000	That resonated for you of a close, cohesive family.
3447000	3451000	I don't think I'm jealous of the cherry farter family.
3451000	3453000	I don't like them.
3453000	3456000	I think they're too close.
3456000	3457000	I don't like that.
3457000	3464000	Why are they doing that together?
3464000	3469000	Well, tell me more about them.
3469000	3471000	What did they do with bananas?
3471000	3473000	Did they shower together?
3473000	3477000	They were kind of, it's the Smotherman family.
3477000	3479000	The Smotherman family?
3480000	3485000	When I moved back from, when I was on the play on Broadway when I was 10 and 11,
3485000	3487000	and then I came back to LA for the first time.
3487000	3488000	9-11?
3488000	3489000	9-11?
3489000	3490000	Okay.
3494000	3496000	Good, good. That was good.
3496000	3500000	That's a healthier response to 9-11.
3500000	3504000	My first day back, I moved back to Whittier, which I'd never lived in,
3504000	3505000	but my grandmother lived there.
3505000	3508000	When I was a little kid, we had a big house with horses and stuff,
3508000	3510000	and then gradually my family lost all of our money.
3510000	3514000	Then I went on the road with my mom, and then my dad was back home.
3514000	3515000	I think they would have gotten divorced.
3515000	3519000	We came back, and we lived in this really small house with this shitty car.
3519000	3521000	I didn't know anybody who moved.
3521000	3523000	It's not a great neighborhood.
3523000	3529000	It wasn't like living in a horrible Detroit or some terrible gunfire going off all night long,
3529000	3533000	but I lived in a really nice hilly, beautiful childhood.
3533000	3535000	Now I didn't know anybody.
3535000	3539000	I remember laying on my parents' bed in this new little house,
3539000	3541000	and all I could hear was a plane going overhead.
3541000	3544000	When you fly into LAX, if you're coming back into LA,
3544000	3546000	and when you hear the flaps go down,
3546000	3548000	if you look out the window, you can see my high school.
3548000	3553000	You can hear from the ground of the planes decelerating.
3553000	3556000	I started crying because it was the only noise I heard,
3556000	3558000	and I had just lived in New York for about a year,
3558000	3561000	where it's just all this input and action and stuff.
3561000	3564000	I was really depressed, and this kid went by on a skateboard,
3564000	3566000	and that was Sam Smotherman, and he lived just down the block,
3566000	3568000	and their family was so cool.
3568000	3570000	Their dad, they were all really Christian,
3570000	3574000	but the most adorable, wonderful version of that,
3574000	3579000	and if everybody were like that, you wouldn't have any negative attachments to that.
3579000	3582000	Sam got really sick as a kid, like some disease.
3582000	3585000	Then he got really wounded in a car accident.
3585000	3587000	They went through a lot of family crises,
3587000	3590000	and they would sit down as a unit, and they would just talk it out.
3591000	3594000	If it came down to it, the father would just say,
3594000	3596000	well, you know, it says in the book of James or whatever,
3596000	3600000	and they're not looking at pedantic or pedagogical or preacher-y way.
3600000	3604000	I just sat there watching it, and it was just like, this is marvelous.
3604000	3606000	And the cherries would come to the table.
3606000	3608000	Well, I hung out there so often.
3608000	3611000	I still have dreams where I'm knocking on Sam Smotherman's door
3611000	3617000	from when I was 13 or 12, but that kitchen,
3618000	3620000	and that one day I hung out there so much,
3620000	3622000	there was a bowl of cherries out there, and I took one,
3622000	3624000	and they all started snickering.
3624000	3626000	I was like, what's the joke?
3626000	3628000	It makes the Smotherman's fart.
3628000	3630000	It makes the Smotherman's fart.
3630000	3632000	Now do you like him?
3632000	3634000	The Smotherman's are fine now.
3636000	3639000	I was pictured in a more white trash, like they drank antifreeze,
3639000	3645000	and one of them huffed himself to death in the basement,
3646000	3648000	but he was still kind of half alive in the hospital.
3648000	3653000	They would, in order to make their cars go faster,
3653000	3655000	they would spit into the air scoop.
3661000	3663000	Spencer, are you up?
3663000	3666000	How did they reach the air scoop from there?
3666000	3668000	They climb out into the hood.
3668000	3670000	This is assuming someone else is driving.
3670000	3672000	Yeah, of course.
3672000	3676000	You're trying to catch somebody to keep them from taking all the control.
3676000	3678000	Does that work?
3678000	3680000	Are there car people here?
3680000	3682000	Did we know that that works, spitting fuel into the air scoop?
3682000	3684000	Do we know that that actually works?
3684000	3686000	I don't know.
3686000	3688000	Anybody here?
3688000	3690000	We're not in a car crowd.
3690000	3692000	What are you even asking?
3692000	3694000	In Mad Max, when they go out in the thing,
3694000	3696000	they're spitting their second fuel out of a hose,
3696000	3698000	and they're spitting it into the intake valves on the hoods of the car,
3698000	3701000	and the car gets super boosted and goes really fast.
3702000	3704000	I'm sure that works perfectly.
3704000	3707000	It doesn't work?
3707000	3709000	It would flood the engine.
3709000	3713000	What if it was like crazy Mad Max cars, though?
3713000	3714000	Okay.
3714000	3717000	I mean, you mean it would flood the engine eventually?
3717000	3719000	Damn!
3719000	3721000	That's why they didn't design the cars,
3721000	3725000	they just have a guy spitting tape to the front of the car,
3725000	3727000	because that would have been impractical,
3727000	3729000	but they're like, this is life or death.
3729000	3731000	They could have just invent a little hose,
3731000	3733000	we used a little squirt bottle,
3733000	3735000	but then they'd overuse it.
3735000	3737000	You know, those guys are nuts.
3737000	3739000	They're anemic guys covered in tumors,
3739000	3743000	they're spray painting, they're war boys.
3743000	3745000	Those guys are crazy.
3745000	3747000	They have no impulse control.
3747000	3749000	You can't give them a hose and say,
3749000	3751000	only do this when you really need it.
3751000	3757000	Your whole society is founded on their feral ferocity.
3757000	3761000	You can't then just ask them to do something in moderation.
3761000	3765000	How dare you?
3765000	3771000	So after like 70 years in the making,
3771000	3773000	we finally closed the deal,
3773000	3777000	we're going to actually start shooting Harmon Quest.
3783000	3785000	Are we going to do new characters, same characters?
3785000	3789000	I think we're going to kind of restart from the ground up.
3789000	3791000	I think it'll basically be the same, maybe a few tweaks here or there.
3791000	3795000	Because it's actually going to be a fancier version of it than we originally planned,
3795000	3797000	because people got excited about it.
3797000	3801000	Now we're going to tape 10 episodes,
3801000	3806000	and it's going to be on some tiny or experimental,
3806000	3808000	I don't know how much I'm allowed to say and not allowed to say,
3808000	3814000	but it'll be out on some platform that you'll be able to find or something.
3814000	3817000	It may or may not play in Canada.
3817000	3819000	I have no idea how that shit's going to work,
3819000	3823000	but it's not Yahoo, it's something else.
3823000	3828000	But we're going to do 10 episodes, so certainly they'll exist.
3828000	3830000	That's so awesome. I can't wait.
3830000	3831000	And we'll have tapings and stuff,
3831000	3833000	and we'll make sure you guys know where to go.
3833000	3837000	That'll be like in September, so you can come and watch us.
3837000	3841000	We'll get the old celebrity guests to come and play with us,
3841000	3843000	and then we're going to animate.
3843000	3845000	Is that your dream team yet?
3845000	3847000	That's probably too soon to talk about that.
3847000	3849000	I think it's just going to be five episodes with Vince Vaughn
3849000	3854000	and then three with Colin Farrell.
3854000	3857000	Did you notice that you know our little dog, Nigel?
3857000	3859000	Do you think he looks like Colin Farrell?
3859000	3861000	He looks a lot like Colin Farrell.
3861000	3863000	He does.
3863000	3866000	I don't know if Aaron's like Instagrammed it yet with a split screen,
3866000	3867000	but he looks...
3867000	3870000	I think I see where you're going. I can imagine.
3871000	3874000	I like Nigel more than Colin Farrell, though.
3876000	3879000	What do you think the show's been like a five, five and a half?
3879000	3880000	Yeah.
3880000	3881000	Out of 20?
3881000	3883000	I call it a solid five and a half.
3883000	3885000	Solid five? That's no good.
3885000	3888000	What do I got to do to make it memorable and extreme?
3888000	3889000	Extreme?
3889000	3892000	Well, maybe not, I mean, not like racist extreme.
3892000	3895000	I got two words.
3895000	3896000	Butt-checking.
3896000	3903000	We could be the first podcast to podcast a butt-chug
3903000	3905000	to livestream a pina colada butt-chug.
3905000	3907000	When somebody did come up and was like,
3907000	3910000	I'll butt-chug, and then they died.
3910000	3913000	And that was just it.
3913000	3915000	Everything in your whole life was leading up to that.
3915000	3918000	Can we generate some sort of waiver that they signed their life away?
3918000	3919000	It still wouldn't matter.
3919000	3923000	It'd still be the podcast that killed a guy by pouring Jack Daniels in his butt.
3924000	3926000	Or a girl.
3927000	3930000	Why don't we start off with butt-checking something nutritive?
3930000	3933000	Just a big, we'll fill a bottle of Jack Daniels with Pedialyte
3933000	3936000	or something like that that won't kill you.
3938000	3940000	That's still butt-checking, right?
3940000	3945000	What if we brought up a guy, stood him on his hands,
3945000	3949000	poured Pedialyte down his butt, and he became like a senator.
3950000	3952000	Or like an astronaut or something.
3952000	3956000	He became like, we found out that that's what you have to do.
3956000	3959000	I think there's only one way to find out.
3960000	3962000	Those people that volunteered to go to Mars and never come back,
3962000	3964000	I think somebody is willing to take that chance.
3964000	3968000	I mean, we'd need a funnel, we'd need Pedialyte.
3970000	3972000	Okay, we can't afford that.
3973000	3974000	The overhead's too extreme.
3974000	3976000	I don't know if you're seriously thinking about it right now.
3976000	3979000	I like that you're getting logistical about this.
3979000	3980000	It means you're actually...
3980000	3983000	I do know that there would be someone in the audience that would be willing to...
3983000	3988000	Should we build a little stand or like gravity boots with their heels clicking?
3988000	3989000	Yeah.
3989000	3990000	Widen them out.
3990000	3991000	What would you wear?
3991000	3992000	That's another thing.
3992000	3993000	What do you have somebody wear?
3993000	3994000	Just nothing?
3994000	3997000	Do you make them a...chaps, I guess, right?
3997000	4002000	Chaps, but on the side it's sponsored by Nike and Reebok or something like that.
4002000	4004000	Well, wouldn't it just be regular pants
4004000	4007000	but just like a little hole for the butthole?
4007000	4010000	The women were unanimous on chaps on that one.
4010000	4013000	That's women's solution to everything.
4013000	4015000	They just like chaps.
4016000	4017000	I mean, either...
4017000	4019000	I would say...
4019000	4021000	I need to understand the context.
4021000	4024000	Do you mean if we're doing this six weeks from now,
4024000	4026000	what kind of equipment would we have NASA build for us?
4026000	4029000	Do we just hold the guys' legs in the air and do it like really like...
4029000	4031000	I mean, that's what the cavemen did.
4031000	4033000	I'm saying we're putting...
4033000	4035000	You spend a lot of money on this live streaming.
4035000	4038000	I say we give...we put on a David Copperfield kind of show.
4038000	4040000	A white tiger comes out.
4040000	4043000	Dan, you already have an inversion table, right?
4043000	4047000	So we just get...you turn them stomach down on it
4047000	4050000	and then you invert them and you're ready to go.
4050000	4053000	Can you start it off like the guy that gets chained into the thing in Temple of Doom
4053000	4054000	and he's like, my mouth's about...
4054000	4056000	Yeah, that's exactly what the inversion table is.
4056000	4057000	My mouth's about...
4057000	4058000	My mouth's about...
4058000	4059000	My mouth's about...
4059000	4060000	Yeah, that's what the inversion table is.
4060000	4061000	And there's gravity boots.
4061000	4062000	They hook up everything.
4062000	4063000	Yeah, we could just bring that in.
4064000	4066000	Are you interested in mulling around when we do the whole thing?
4066000	4067000	Yeah.
4067000	4068000	Oh, yeah.
4068000	4069000	And then you have the pity light thing and it's like a beating heart
4069000	4070000	or shankara stone or whatever.
4070000	4072000	Yeah, that's great.
4072000	4076000	And we've got to have lawyers like clear the paperwork and stuff.
4076000	4077000	That's the easy part, Dan.
4077000	4080000	The person could like die or become a senator.
4080000	4083000	And the inversion table can be dedicated to that
4083000	4086000	because I'm going to the chiropractor three times a week now.
4086000	4089000	That was the only last thing that's new for me.
4089000	4090000	So that thing's just going to waste.
4090000	4091000	Yeah.
4091000	4093000	Yeah, my back's all fucked up, Jeff.
4093000	4094000	Okay.
4094000	4096000	Are you in pain currently, like as we speak?
4096000	4098000	I'm all right right now, right at the moment.
4098000	4101000	But if I sit for more than 20 minutes and then I get up, it's like, ow.
4101000	4103000	Since the new smoking...
4103000	4104000	I know, please.
4104000	4105000	I just...
4105000	4106000	I got to say it.
4106000	4107000	Since the new smoking, yeah, yeah.
4107000	4108000	Yeah.
4108000	4109000	But as the guy is like adjusting my back,
4109000	4111000	I think I'm having like a Kundalini awakening or something.
4111000	4113000	Like I think my...
4113000	4114000	He was talking all this...
4114000	4116000	You know chiropractors are like...
4116000	4117000	That's my chiropractor.
4119000	4120000	You know, they're kind of knuckleheads.
4120000	4122000	They're not real doctors and they always have to like...
4122000	4124000	They kind of have to like...
4124000	4129000	They feel compelled to like add extra stuff to the chiropractic stuff
4129000	4134000	because that makes them feel more than a backcracker.
4134000	4135000	Like they're...
4135000	4139000	You know, they have to be like, also, you know, this helps cure the cold
4139000	4140000	and you should bring your baby in.
4140000	4142000	And it's like, nah, come on.
4142000	4143000	Quit being a crazy person.
4143000	4145000	Like just crack my back.
4145000	4147000	So I'm going to one of these guys.
4147000	4148000	But now I'm like...
4148000	4153000	At this point, the only thing I can do from here is back surgery,
4153000	4154000	which I don't want to do.
4154000	4155000	So I'm just...
4155000	4158000	For the next year, I'm just going to commit to whatever this guy says
4158000	4160000	and he's like, don't sit for more than a half hour at a time.
4160000	4161000	Jesus Christ.
4161000	4162000	And he's like...
4162000	4166000	He's got a little jackhammer device that he's using to hammer my vertebrae
4166000	4168000	and I'm going in there three times a week.
4168000	4170000	But then I'll be like walking around my house
4170000	4172000	and then I'll start crying for no reason.
4172000	4176000	So I think maybe some of the stuff he's like saying is like not total bullshit.
4176000	4178000	I thought it was because it was like...
4178000	4182000	So, you know, like a chiropractor, you go in and they go...
4182000	4183000	They go, where does it hurt?
4183000	4185000	And you go right here.
4185000	4187000	And they go, okay, look at the chart.
4187000	4188000	This is...
4188000	4189000	I don't know why I say...
4189000	4192000	This has happened to me several times, but this is...
4192000	4195000	This is what the guy did recently.
4195000	4196000	This is exactly what happened.
4196000	4198000	Like Monday I go in.
4198000	4199000	Where does it hurt?
4199000	4200000	Right here.
4200000	4202000	So he holds up this cartoon of a back
4202000	4205000	and then there's like next to each vertebrae, there's like this list of shit.
4205000	4207000	And they're kind of like horoscopes.
4207000	4208000	It's like...
4208000	4209000	It says like...
4209000	4211000	L1 vertebrae.
4211000	4215000	You're outgoing, but a little withdrawn, you know.
4215000	4219000	Except instead of that it says like organ function, kidney function,
4219000	4221000	kidney with a little bit of organ, you know.
4221000	4224000	And it's like kind of like not that scientific.
4224000	4226000	So he's like, look at this.
4226000	4227000	It says like, yeah.
4227000	4231000	It says erectile dysfunction bowel.
4231000	4233000	Do you have any problems with your bowels?
4233000	4235000	And I said, well...
4235000	4241000	I mean, I don't like taking shits.
4241000	4243000	I mean, I don't look forward to them.
4243000	4244000	They're not like...
4244000	4246000	I don't like high five myself after I shit.
4246000	4249000	It's not really a problem with your bowel function though.
4249000	4250000	Right.
4250000	4252000	And he goes, uh-huh.
4252000	4257000	And I go, and hey, who doesn't want more hard-ons?
4257000	4258000	And he goes, uh-huh.
4258000	4261000	So anyways, and then I crack my back, okay.
4261000	4263000	So then the next time I go in, he goes like,
4263000	4267000	so I put together a full report, and he's like showing me all this stuff.
4267000	4270000	And then he's going, so remember those bowel problems
4270000	4272000	and erectile dysfunctions that you talked about?
4272000	4274000	Well, guess what vertebrae that correlates to.
4274000	4275000	And look where your pain is.
4275000	4276000	I'm like, dude, I told you all that.
4276000	4278000	What? You can't...
4278000	4279000	Cornball.
4279000	4281000	The mentalist.
4281000	4283000	It's like a carnival trick or something.
4283000	4285000	But I don't think it's intentional.
4285000	4288000	He's just not a doctor.
4288000	4290000	I took off my shirt, and he's like,
4290000	4292000	oh, you have open sores all over your back.
4292000	4293000	I'm like, it's acne.
4293000	4294000	Like, I have acne on my back.
4294000	4295000	He's like, yeah, but they're...
4295000	4296000	That's not acne.
4296000	4297000	I'm like, yeah, it is.
4297000	4298000	It's gross acne.
4298000	4300000	Like, have you ever had acne on your back?
4300000	4301000	No.
4301000	4303000	Well, just quit bullying me.
4303000	4306000	I don't have open sores on my back.
4306000	4308000	It's like, oh, do you scratch?
4308000	4309000	I was like, yeah, look at my back.
4309000	4311000	It's covered in fucking Ron Jeremy hair.
4311000	4313000	Like, yes, I'm scratching my back.
4313000	4314000	Oh, you're...
4314000	4316000	But then he was talking about, like, yeah,
4316000	4319000	and there's, like, I think that, you know,
4319000	4321000	that sarcoidosis thing you told me about,
4321000	4324000	you know, that and those open sores and stuff.
4324000	4326000	And I'm like, what does sarcoidosis have to do with open...
4326000	4327000	What are you talking...
4327000	4328000	Stop calling them open sores.
4328000	4329000	They're zits.
4329000	4331000	Like, you're making me feel really bad.
4331000	4336000	And he's like, well, you know, they're sores, you know.
4336000	4338000	And when you have something outside your body,
4338000	4340000	you know that inside your body, you know,
4340000	4342000	you have the same thing.
4342000	4344000	You're saying I have acne on my spleen?
4344000	4345000	Like, you're...
4345000	4347000	Will you just crack my back?
4347000	4348000	You're not a doctor.
4348000	4349000	This is crazy talk.
4349000	4350000	You could really upset somebody.
4350000	4352000	And, like, you're making me feel like,
4352000	4353000	this is why I don't go swimming.
4353000	4355000	This is the same guy you still go to?
4355000	4358000	Yeah, but...
4358000	4361000	But he's not, like, he's not...
4361000	4362000	He's not doing it on purpose.
4362000	4364000	Like, he just doesn't know what he's talking about.
4364000	4367000	Like, he does know backs.
4367000	4369000	He does know, like, the nervous system.
4369000	4371000	Like, he's...
4371000	4373000	And as my back is getting adjusted, like,
4373000	4374000	I am, like...
4374000	4376000	I feel like my memory's improving.
4376000	4379000	Like, kind of?
4379000	4381000	I think we were talking about this the other day.
4381000	4382000	And now I start weeping.
4382000	4384000	I was just, like, whack around my house.
4384000	4385000	I just started crying for no reason.
4385000	4386000	Absolutely no reason.
4386000	4389000	I got a massage with just, like,
4389000	4391000	a friend gave me a birth certificate.
4391000	4392000	Jesus Christ.
4392000	4394000	My friend gave me a birth certificate.
4394000	4395000	What'd you do with it?
4395000	4397000	I'm a father.
4397000	4399000	A gift certificate to Brooke Williams Spa.
4399000	4400000	Like, if you go to Brooke Williams,
4400000	4401000	that's a spa where you're like,
4401000	4404000	I don't expect to go, like, find magical healing there.
4404000	4405000	It's more of just relaxation.
4405000	4406000	And I love massages.
4406000	4407000	I like deep tissue.
4407000	4408000	I want it to hurt.
4408000	4410000	Like, I want a massage to be, like, a street fight.
4410000	4411000	I want to come out.
4411000	4413000	I want to whimper the whole time
4413000	4415000	and just be, like, just bruised and battered.
4415000	4418000	And so I got this woman named Carmen
4418000	4419000	who's no longer there, which is sad,
4419000	4421000	because she instantly, like,
4421000	4422000	the moment she put her hands up...
4422000	4423000	Karma?
4423000	4424000	Carmen.
4424000	4426000	And she was like this kind of short,
4426000	4429000	squat, like, fit, like, Latina woman.
4430000	4431000	And she was very quiet and stuff like that.
4431000	4432000	And she's like, where does it hurt?
4432000	4434000	I said, I've always got stuff on my right shoulder.
4434000	4435000	And she said, all right.
4435000	4437000	And she starts working everywhere else.
4437000	4438000	And I was like, well, you wonder if she's ever going to get there.
4438000	4440000	And she's like, just so you know,
4440000	4442000	this is where you're feeling it starts here.
4442000	4443000	And I was like, gah!
4443000	4445000	Like, she just touched me, like, on my collar bone.
4445000	4448000	And I instantly, like, almost came to pieces,
4448000	4449000	like, in pain.
4449000	4450000	And she goes, just so you know.
4450000	4451000	I said, well, we're not going to start there.
4451000	4452000	We're going to do this and that.
4452000	4453000	And she goes, it also goes all the way down
4453000	4454000	in your sciatic nerve, which is, you know,
4454000	4455000	like, your butt cheeks.
4455000	4458000	And she was kneading on my right butt cheek.
4458000	4460000	And she goes, by the way, you're going to start crying.
4460000	4461000	And not from pain.
4461000	4463000	Like, she goes, you're very emotional.
4463000	4465000	And you hide it all right here.
4465000	4466000	In your butt?
4466000	4467000	She goes, we all.
4467000	4468000	She goes.
4468000	4469000	She said.
4469000	4475000	She goes, we all hide a lot of sadness in our butts.
4475000	4476000	So she does it.
4476000	4477000	And I'm like, she's like, Jeff, she goes,
4477000	4480000	you're not going to let, like, all that sadness go right now.
4480000	4481000	But you're like, well.
4481000	4483000	It just saves them for it.
4483000	4484000	And I was just sobbing.
4484000	4485000	Like, completely.
4485000	4489000	She's like, just try as much of that sadness as I was like.
4489000	4492000	And also, you need to come and get a lot more massages.
4492000	4494000	I'm like, fuck, yeah, I do.
4494000	4496000	But it's really weepy and emotional.
4496000	4500000	I never saw myself as, like, this whole, like, stress guy.
4500000	4501000	But I clearly am.
4501000	4504000	Like, that whole respiratory alkalosis thing
4504000	4505000	was just ridiculous.
4505000	4507000	It was just such a stupid thing.
4507000	4509000	And then this back thing, like, it's just like,
4509000	4511000	it's very clear, like, I've been, like,
4511000	4514000	under a lot of, like, I just, like, don't deal with my stress
4514000	4515000	at all.
4515000	4516000	Yeah, I told somebody a long time,
4516000	4518000	because I have all these, like, what they call, like,
4518000	4519000	knots of scar tissue.
4519000	4520000	Pardon me.
4520000	4521000	I'm at my shoulders.
4521000	4523000	What's that character?
4523000	4525000	Frog in the throat.
4525000	4526000	My name is Dr. Frog in the throat.
4526000	4527000	Frog in the throat.
4527000	4529000	Scar tissue.
4529000	4531000	Oh, it's carnival Carl.
4531000	4533000	Are you cough shaming me right now?
4533000	4534000	I'm just trying.
4534000	4537000	I'm self-shaming about how uneventful the show's been.
4537000	4539000	I'll be like, wait, is that a character?
4542000	4545000	I went back and listened to the whole Thai-Brigson thing.
4545000	4547000	I was on the ride here crying, laughing.
4547000	4549000	Yeah, well, I mean, don't rub it in.
4549000	4550000	Like, look at tonight.
4550000	4551000	Tonight's been awful.
4551000	4552000	It's been terrible.
4552000	4553000	You know what?
4553000	4554000	It's summertime.
4554000	4555000	It's hot.
4555000	4556000	We're never going to expect this.
4556000	4557000	So fucking hot.
4557000	4558000	And I ate so many tacos.
4558000	4561000	And I just sat in my own farts all day
4561000	4563000	and played a video game, which is a terrible,
4563000	4564000	I should never do that on Sundays.
4564000	4565000	Are you farting, like, honestly?
4565000	4567000	No, I'm clenching and clenching it in.
4567000	4569000	When you walk off the stage, you're just going to, like,
4569000	4573000	No, I've learned to, I can hold a fart real good.
4573000	4574000	Yeah.
4574000	4576000	Like, I do it until it finally, then there's that point
4576000	4579000	where it reverse farts up into your lungs.
4579000	4582000	I don't think, I don't think.
4582000	4584000	You guys know what I'm talking about.
4584000	4586000	I don't think Ryan Styles would mind me mentioning this.
4586000	4587000	Ryan Styles cannot burp.
4587000	4589000	But he can fart on command.
4589000	4592000	I go, Jeff, he's never been able to burp.
4592000	4595000	But he goes, I can always give you a fart.
4595000	4596000	And they never smell.
4596000	4598000	He'll come up to me and go, Jeff, give me a burp.
4598000	4599000	Give me a number.
4599000	4600000	I go, 11.
4600000	4605000	And he goes, what, for, to fucking give you 11.
4605000	4607000	Perfect little, like, equal farts.
4607000	4609000	Also, when he travels on a plane, everywhere we go,
4609000	4611000	so I travel with this guy all the time,
4611000	4613000	he always has an extra pair of pants in his bag
4613000	4617000	and his carry-on in case he shits his pants.
4617000	4620000	And, you know, he's 53.
4620000	4621000	I don't know what he is.
4621000	4622000	Like, something like Ryan there.
4622000	4624000	I said, have you, in your life, have you ever shit your pants?
4624000	4625000	He goes, no, but I don't want to find,
4625000	4627000	I don't want the first time to be on a plane.
4628000	4629000	So everywhere he goes,
4629000	4631000	he's got an extra pair of Ryan Stiles pants on.
4631000	4634000	Does it take a different, does it take a special scale
4634000	4637000	when you choose the green?
4637000	4638000	Are you changing the green?
4638000	4639000	The green size?
4639000	4640000	Pardon?
4640000	4642000	Does it take, do you need a different scale
4642000	4645000	for each size of green?
4646000	4648000	I guess so, yeah.
4648000	4652000	When you're picking the kind of rice
4652000	4655000	that you're going to have thrown at your wedding to Ryan Stiles?
4658000	4660000	Whoo!
4663000	4665000	I mean, who is this guy?
4665000	4669000	Some kind of Dan Harmon replacement.
4670000	4671000	You're jealous again.
4671000	4672000	You were jealous of the Smothermans.
4672000	4673000	You were jealous of Ryan Stiles.
4673000	4675000	Oh, he farts so much.
4675000	4677000	Oh, he farts all the time.
4677000	4680000	Oh, and he carries a special pair of pants
4680000	4683000	in case he, because he poops his pants, too.
4683000	4685000	What am I, a chopped liver?
4685000	4686000	You're so jealous right now.
4686000	4688000	Yeah, yeah.
4689000	4693000	Dan, I'm here every Sunday with you because I love you more.
4693000	4694000	And I do it for free.
4694000	4696000	I get paid to go out with Ryan.
4696000	4700000	I do this for free out of the love that I feel for you.
4708000	4711000	Well, this is really awkward for me because I already,
4712000	4715000	I made love to the redhead in the lighthouse.
4718000	4721000	So I can't reciprocate.
4721000	4722000	Oh.
4722000	4723000	I feel bad.
4723000	4724000	Oh, it's okay.
4724000	4727000	You're going to miss like 40 minutes of the video again.
4730000	4731000	Hey, Spencer.
4731000	4732000	Hey, Dan.
4732000	4735000	Did you guys watch him deflect that fucking shit?
4735000	4739000	Did you see the jiu-jitsu Matrix backbend bullet
4739000	4741000	fly over his hand?
4742000	4745000	I remember the first time I hugged you,
4745000	4748000	you looked like you wanted to shrivel up and die.
4751000	4753000	You're more of a hugger now than you were.
4753000	4755000	You're still not really a hugger.
4757000	4759000	Dan, let me love you.
4759000	4761000	I love everybody.
4761000	4762000	Oh.
4767000	4770000	The giant pina colada makes this whole thing so sad.
4784000	4786000	I don't want a hug.
4787000	4791000	How does your chiropractor feel about you carrying around giant drinks that heavy?
4792000	4797000	I always, like, you know, like every time someone dies, Rob always like,
4797000	4799000	we already talked about that, right?
4799000	4800000	I don't remember.
4800000	4802000	Rob's always like, hey, man, take care of yourself.
4802000	4804000	I'm like, come on, quit making me feel like,
4804000	4812000	he sent me a, he sent, he, he texted me like a, like a, like a
4812000	4815000	animated gif of like how the human heart works or something.
4816000	4818000	But it wasn't like heart, like love.
4818000	4820000	It was like valves and stuff.
4820000	4823000	And it was like, I hope you're taking care of yourself or something.
4823000	4825000	Like it was like, are you just calling me fat?
4825000	4827000	I saw that text message.
4827000	4829000	Was that a group text or what?
4829000	4831000	Because I saw that.
4831000	4833000	Did he, was that after Harris died?
4833000	4837000	It was also after Robin Williams died and after Harris died after every,
4837000	4842000	every time someone dies, Rob, Rob makes me feel like he puts me in the same
4842000	4846000	category as people who died because I'm going to die next.
4846000	4850000	And he doesn't, and he wants, he wants me to not die next.
4850000	4854000	So, and he thinks that it's as simple as telling me not to,
4854000	4857000	which it wouldn't be.
4857000	4860000	Like I'm not going to take a poll before I die.
4860000	4861000	Who doesn't want me to die?
4861000	4864000	Okay, got it.
4864000	4865000	Just checking.
4865000	4868000	Like, like, I thought everyone wanted me to die.
4868000	4872000	But like, but also like, it's like, I can't tell, are you saying I'm fat?
4872000	4875000	Are you saying I should work out or are you saying like,
4875000	4877000	you're worried about me mentally?
4877000	4881000	But in either case, can't you just, can't you just be nice to me?
4881000	4884000	Why do you have to, that makes me, doesn't,
4884000	4889000	wouldn't that make you feel bad if people were like, hey man, you okay?
4889000	4891000	You'd be like, well, what's wrong with me?
4891000	4893000	Why are you looking at me like that, you know?
4893000	4894000	Yeah, I get it, I get it.
4894000	4895000	It's weird.
4895000	4900000	Does he never, does he not reach out like, personally and like, have,
4900000	4904000	but also, I mean, I don't know what the impulse is there,
4904000	4909000	but to come and throw my arms around you and hug you and tell you I love you
4909000	4911000	would make you very uncomfortable,
4911000	4914000	which might make people less inclined to come at you in that direct way.
4914000	4919000	Maybe you have to start making heart jiffs and stuff.
4919000	4923000	Maybe, I mean, there's probably a happy medium somewhere in between.
4923000	4926000	Did you know the correct pronunciation is jiff?
4933000	4938000	Did you know it's, you know, it's, it's when people say that's not my, my forte.
4938000	4939000	It's supposed to be fort.
4939000	4940000	Yep.
4940000	4942000	Did you know it's not chomping, chomping at the bit.
4942000	4945000	It's supposed to be champing at the bit.
4945000	4953000	No, he, but here's the thing.
4953000	4956000	He just took that guy's concept and reiterated it.
4956000	4959000	It's not original or, or daring.
4959000	4960000	Really.
4960000	4963000	You're saying he, he recycled a heckle from behind him?
4963000	4964000	Yes.
4964000	4965000	I mean, essentially.
4965000	4966000	Okay.
4966000	4967000	Well, I didn't even hear it.
4967000	4968000	I didn't really take it as a slam.
4968000	4973000	I thought it was like, man, this shit's getting exciting.
4973000	4974000	This isn't still boring news, is it?
4974000	4977000	I think, I think he knew it'd be funny to say this is, is this still boring?
4977000	4978000	Yeah.
4978000	4979000	We really went down a road.
4979000	4981000	Cause the last guy demonstrated it worked.
4981000	4982000	Yeah.
4982000	4983000	And I'm not a hypocrite.
4983000	4986000	I'm not going to stand up here and shit the bed and like, then get mad at people for
4986000	4987000	talking.
4987000	4988000	I will.
4988000	4993000	Somebody, is there anybody in the audience, uh, feeling particularly passionate about
4993000	4995000	anything at all tonight?
4995000	4999000	Like, well, I mean, it's not a yes or no question.
4999000	5002000	I mean, well, I mean, it is if you want to come up and talk about it.
5002000	5005000	Does anybody, does anybody, anybody feel strongly enough?
5005000	5007000	Is that, is that, is that Dave Klein?
5007000	5010000	Oh, we should've added Dave Klein on.
5010000	5011000	Dave Klein.
5017000	5018000	Glitchy Rap.
5018000	5019000	Glitch Rap.
5019000	5020000	Just sit there for the cameras.
5020000	5021000	What's up?
5021000	5027000	Yo, I can tell by the lack of the audience reply that I wasn't requested, but my boy
5027000	5033000	Dan, he denied that he was ready to go solo against this motherfucker that said he's
5033000	5036000	on solo, ready to get into the fucking carbon night.
5036000	5037000	I'm saying it's his night.
5037000	5039000	I'm saying he's getting ready to fight.
5039000	5041000	I'm saying his dick is harder than a fucking rock.
5041000	5044000	He's talking about motherfucking my dick don't work.
5044000	5048000	He's saying, yo, my dick's working in the industry for longer than you've been alive.
5048000	5049000	Motherfucker.
5050000	5051000	All right.
5052000	5054000	So Dave, how you been?
5054000	5055000	All right.
5055000	5057000	So it's been a long time since I've been here.
5057000	5064000	I want to give a shout out to Colorado, my secondary home.
5064000	5069000	I want to give a shout out to New Jersey, my home that I love, but that I left because
5069000	5072000	I heard Dan Harmon speaking from his chest in his heart.
5072000	5076000	I met this guy that you guys won't know at the bar after the night, and I'm going to
5076000	5078000	drop some shit he don't want me to drop.
5078000	5079000	Guy.
5080000	5085000	Is operating on a level that you're not ready for?
5089000	5095000	And I can only like let a beautiful man like this sit on my lap because he knows what I'm
5095000	5096000	talking about.
5096000	5097000	Here's what happened.
5097000	5101000	I went to Denver after I saw these guys because I saw bad shit in L.A.
5101000	5105000	I'm from Jersey and New York and I seen some weird and bad shit.
5105000	5106000	What'd you see?
5107000	5108000	What did you see?
5108000	5109000	What did you see?
5109000	5112000	My friend lost his heart and he's not with us anymore.
5112000	5113000	Damn.
5113000	5114000	You saw that happen?
5117000	5121000	I live an interesting life and we'll talk about it another time, but I want to give
5121000	5122000	a shout out.
5122000	5124000	What do you mean he lost his heart?
5124000	5125000	Like it stopped?
5125000	5126000	It stopped?
5126000	5127000	He had a heart attack?
5127000	5132000	I have a friend who is a really wonderful and creative individual out here who lost his
5132000	5135000	heart and commits suicide, but you asked me and I didn't want to get there.
5135000	5139000	I was trying to bounce around that, but that's the truth of it.
5139000	5143000	And I've seen it happen too often and when you said like your boy sends you the thing
5143000	5147000	with the gif and then he says something really prescient like maybe they couldn't address
5147000	5148000	you.
5148000	5149000	Like really clearly we've talked about this on the show.
5149000	5151000	I'll cut it right to this.
5151000	5153000	Why are we all here?
5153000	5154000	This guy.
5154000	5155000	Why are we all here?
5155000	5156000	These podcasts.
5156000	5160000	Why are we here on like a quiet night when we're like not sure and the show isn't like
5160000	5164000	ripping it on like 700 levels that we're used to it ripping on like when they were at fucking
5164000	5169000	San Diego when they were when they were ripping it squatchy when they were ripping
5169000	5172000	it on 700 different levels and we have like a down that we're like wait what's going
5172000	5173000	on tonight?
5173000	5180000	It's that there's 200 people in a basement in LA and we love each other so much that
5180000	5184000	a lot of us actually show up to like hang out on weeks when this doesn't even happen
5184000	5192000	that I have friends in LA because of you and the people that choose to show up to a thing
5192000	5196000	like this because you're honest and you come up to a thing not with like you know your
5196000	5201000	degenerate alcoholic you know swank thing I see that a lot where I live you come up
5201000	5205000	here with the thing your wife made you because she loves you and she knows you and she was
5205000	5209000	taking care of you when you're back hurt and you're a good guy playing witcher staying true
5209000	5210000	to that life.
5210000	5215000	So you you to be clear though you agree this is not one of our best episodes.
5215000	5225000	Like to be really clear like to be really clear like pseudo self deprecating.
5225000	5231000	If Dave Klein's appearing on the show we hit a pothole we're trying to fix it or like whatever
5231000	5235000	or you're just being really generous to a guy that I swear to you I'm not here for fame
5235000	5239000	I swear to you I didn't move to LA to like get on the mic I came to LA because I fucking
5239000	5243000	loved this guy and that everyone I knew that I cared about gave a lot of shits about what
5244000	5248000	he makes and then all the rest of the people I didn't give a shit about cared about what
5248000	5249000	Jeff makes.
5249000	5251000	No I'm kidding.
5251000	5252000	I can take it.
5252000	5257000	Everyone I know from Greg Proops to the rest of the fucking crew that you roll with to
5257000	5263000	the fucking crew that you roll with to the community you created.
5263000	5264000	Who's that character?
5264000	5265000	Who's that character?
5265000	5266000	No no no.
5266000	5267000	Come on Jeff.
5268000	5269000	Uh oh.
5269000	5274000	The character that he created is us and the joke is on everyone who isn't here tonight.
5274000	5275000	Oh shit.
5275000	5276000	Everyone.
5277000	5278000	You hear that?
5278000	5280000	No no really and I love you all.
5280000	5283000	That's right me and Gene and then I'm gonna break his love neck.
5284000	5287000	I love everyone and there's a strange thing even like looking at and like you don't see
5287000	5291000	that there's like some interesting paper whatever there's a crew here that's so beautiful and
5291000	5295000	it's like so inspiring that on like the lull shows that we call them or like whatever.
5296000	5300000	Yo you know what man those are my favorite ones cause it's I I'll quote Tarantino.
5300000	5304000	He says there's a genre of movie called a hangout movie.
5304000	5308000	I just saw on Magic Mike XXL everybody see it like instantly.
5309000	5317000	It was like an ultimate mandate with my bro friend and God I loved it but this podcast
5317000	5320000	is on the level of like Rio Grande.
5320000	5322000	Magic Mike XXL.
5323000	5325000	And land before time.
5327000	5331000	And it's like the hangout thing that like the what why we come here and even on the
5331000	5336000	lull shows even when you're in a hypoglycemic pseudo coma and you're popping on that
5336000	5340000	gorgeous thing like you are from that beautiful woman you married and swindled into loving
5340000	5341000	you forever.
5341000	5346000	We're here because we love you and maybe I'm just here to just say fucking never give
5346000	5351000	up fucking never stop doing this and my name is Dave fucking Klein I'm dropping the mic.
5352000	5357000	Let's bring up Demarj Brown.
5357000	5358000	Demarj you here?
5366000	5372000	You know Dave what I love about you are the things are manifold but I love that you know
5372000	5378000	how to make an entrance and how to make an exit because that's always a valuable currency.
5378000	5384000	Yeah any equity that was withdrawn or deposited at all in the end none of it matters because
5384000	5389000	he just evaporates like a scottish mist.
5389000	5393000	He's like the little train that comes through Mr. Rogers living room.
5393000	5397000	He's like a winger speech personified.
5397000	5407000	I kind of feel like I'm a visual thinker like my image of him I like yeah the image of him
5407000	5412000	is the little fire extinguisher inside the glass that says break in case of emergency
5412000	5418000	and then on the fire extinguisher says yup.
5418000	5420000	He's a very positive guy.
5420000	5424000	Yeah well I was actually thinking I was thinking that it was kind of a disservice to him that
5424000	5430000	it was a low energy show and then and then he would come up because it was like like actually
5430000	5434000	you know it would have it might have been it might have been better to have somebody just come up
5434000	5442000	and go like I'm gonna I'm gonna get a divorce and we'd be like why and she's like cuz of 9-11
5442000	5447000	and then we'd be like holy shit and she'd start crying and I don't know why I made it a woman
5447000	5454000	so it could be emotional but the and then and then we would have won a castee.
5454000	5459000	The prestigious podcast award which is what it's a it's a podcasting award.
5459000	5461000	I made it up.
5461000	5462000	Here we go.
5462000	5463000	What's up DeMarj?
5463000	5468000	Oh you know same old saying well I can't follow that. Jesus Christ.
5468000	5470000	I feel like femurs.
5484000	5486000	It's a Fuji to scale five.
5486000	5487000	Here's my pitch Dan.
5487000	5493000	Before we say don't do cheat day on Sundays because it because you're overly fed or whatever and sluggish.
5493000	5498000	Why don't we try a different like all Indian food or like all Indian food.
5498000	5504000	Well I was gonna say maybe I could double my Adderall dosage on Sundays.
5504000	5507000	Rob's going to double his JIF dosage on you.
5511000	5512000	Well.
5513000	5515000	What do you think?
5515000	5516000	What do you think?
5516000	5517000	What do you think?
5517000	5520000	What's left in the in the tank?
5520000	5521000	You got to try that DeMarj.
5521000	5522000	Oh jeez.
5522000	5523000	Oh god.
5523000	5525000	Don't look at it just try it.
5525000	5527000	Oh do you want to try something?
5527000	5529000	Spencer did you try?
5529000	5531000	Ah no no.
5531000	5533000	Spencer's not a real alcohol guy.
5533000	5534000	No it makes me sick.
5534000	5536000	I get my my joints start to ache.
5536000	5538000	DeMarj butt chug it.
5538000	5540000	Butt chug it.
5541000	5543000	Careful it'll spill on you.
5543000	5544000	Oh wow.
5546000	5547000	All right.
5551000	5553000	The suspense is killing us.
5556000	5559000	It's it's the coldest thing in the room.
5560000	5561000	It's delicious.
5561000	5562000	That's great.
5562000	5563000	That's fantastic.
5563000	5564000	You're not a video game guy are you?
5564000	5567000	If it's like sports sports video games.
5567000	5568000	Oh yeah.
5568000	5569000	Fighters and stuff.
5569000	5570000	Sports.
5570000	5571000	People are disappointed.
5571000	5572000	It just kept my damn mouth.
5572000	5581000	If my mind was sharper I could come up with a great analogy for like sports video games is like and in the punchline I have to throw it to a room though.
5581000	5584000	Well what were you gonna say if let's say it was a video game.
5584000	5590000	Oh I don't know I was gonna ask if you've seen you've been playing Witcher 3.
5592000	5595000	Oh yes absolutely I have been.
5596000	5599000	I just got through the thorns of the black the thorn level.
5600000	5601000	No I haven't.
5603000	5604000	They're tricky.
5605000	5609000	Are there any female gamers here that don't play sports video games.
5610000	5611000	Are you playing Witcher 3.
5611000	5613000	Are they gonna hear who do.
5615000	5618000	Any women playing Witcher 3 in the audience.
5618000	5619000	Young ladies.
5619000	5620000	What game are you playing.
5621000	5622000	Oh I played that.
5622000	5623000	That's kind of fun.
5624000	5626000	That's the one with Juno and.
5627000	5628000	Ellen Page.
5628000	5629000	Ellen Page is in the game.
5630000	5631000	Juno.
5631000	5632000	Yeah.
5632000	5633000	Did you play.
5634000	5640000	Do you want to come up and talk to you about video games for a second and you can play Shadowrun with us.
5648000	5649000	So bright up here.
5649000	5650000	Yeah.
5650000	5651000	And it's hot.
5651000	5652000	It's fucking hot.
5652000	5655000	In a second you'll be sweating and you'll be like what kind of horrible monster am I.
5655000	5656000	You're not.
5656000	5657000	You're just a french fry.
5658000	5659000	It's not you.
5659000	5660000	It's the lights.
5660000	5661000	It's the heat.
5661000	5662000	What's your name.
5662000	5663000	Emily.
5663000	5664000	Hello Emily.
5664000	5665000	Hello.
5665000	5666000	Welcome to Harmontown.
5666000	5667000	Yeah.
5667000	5668000	Yeah.
5668000	5669000	Okay so so did you play heavy rain.
5669000	5670000	Oh.
5670000	5671000	Hard run or heavy rain.
5671000	5672000	Heavy rain.
5672000	5673000	Heavy rain.
5673000	5674000	Yes with the origami killer.
5674000	5676000	But that but that compared to those are the same people.
5676000	5677000	I agree.
5677000	5678000	No heavy rain was much better.
5678000	5682000	Like they figured out how to they made loops and bounds.
5682000	5683000	Yes.
5683000	5684000	With that video game style.
5684000	5685000	Yes.
5685000	5690000	And I think that's why Quantic Dream is so good is because it's like an interactive movie.
5690000	5696000	And but Beyond Two Souls is like I was not expecting it to be so scary.
5696000	5697000	Yeah.
5697000	5699000	Like holy shit.
5699000	5707000	It's basically if nobody knows what this game is about it's basically Ellen Page is recreated as Jodie and she is this character who has this entity.
5707000	5709000	That is attached to her.
5709000	5711000	And basically it's the whole time.
5711000	5716000	Like all these people are trying to control her and make her do all these things that she doesn't want to do and blah blah blah.
5716000	5718000	Anyways it ends up being like.
5718000	5719000	No.
5719000	5720000	Yeah.
5720000	5721000	This is what.
5721000	5722000	I thought you were going to spoil it.
5722000	5723000	This is this French company made this right.
5723000	5724000	Is this the game.
5724000	5725000	French company.
5725000	5728000	I hung out with her for a while and she was in town and she was making a game.
5728000	5730000	She was in France though I think.
5730000	5731000	Yeah.
5731000	5732000	Yeah.
5732000	5733000	That's what she was making for all that time.
5733000	5734000	Okay.
5734000	5737000	And it's weird how Willem Dafoe looks as a CG person.
5737000	5738000	Yeah.
5738000	5747000	He I thought he looked like a cartoon in person and then it was like wow he actually looks better as a cartoon.
5747000	5748000	Yeah.
5748000	5749000	It's a it's a it's a weird effect.
5749000	5750000	Yeah.
5750000	5751000	Yeah.
5751000	5752000	Anyways.
5752000	5753000	Yeah.
5753000	5754000	Yeah.
5754000	5758000	Video games are getting more immersive Jeff.
5758000	5763000	Can you guys handle that with your soccer soccer.
5763000	5764000	Yeah.
5764000	5765000	You got to be careful.
5765000	5766000	If we start.
5766000	5767000	I'll keep my mouth shut.
5767000	5768000	If you and I share a love of anything right now.
5768000	5769000	Dan.
5769000	5770000	I did.
5770000	5771000	I did an hour and a half podcast before this.
5771000	5776000	Dan you're very vulnerable jealous kind of emotionally precarious place right now.
5776000	5782040	Because I was I've been for the last 30 minutes I've been holding in farts and now as of my
5782040	5785880	last sip of pina colada now I'm also holding down vomit.
5785880	5790000	No it's it's so funny because I am like a Chinese finger trap.
5790000	5791000	No.
5792000	5793000	You looked at me.
5793000	5794000	I'm the opposite of it.
5794000	5802000	I'm like a water balloon with that's untied on two ends.
5802000	5803000	No.
5803000	5810000	I'm like a I'm like a toothpaste tube in a vice grip with a cap on each end.
5810000	5815000	You're like a you're like a pipe bomb with no the bits on the end to hold the stuff in.
5815000	5817000	It's just all going to go out both sides.
5817000	5821000	I'm like I'm like maybe we should get Ryan Stiles in here.
5821000	5824000	You should be like a donut.
5824000	5826000	I'm sure he could come up with.
5826000	5827000	He would come up with 20.
5827000	5828000	Yeah.
5828000	5829000	You know why?
5829000	5831000	Because he's a gifted he wouldn't let the show fucking sink like this fucking going
5831000	5835000	down right now because he's a hard worker and he does he gets up here and he and if
5835000	5839000	he has to skin a knee or chip a tooth to make these people laugh he fucking does it.
5839000	5842000	We should bring cherries out.
5842000	5847000	No the smothermans aren't here.
5847000	5851000	To us they're just regular fruits to the smothermans their treasure.
5851000	5853000	I hate cherries.
5853000	5854000	Cherries?
5854000	5855000	I do not like cherries.
5855000	5856000	Not a fan.
5856000	5861000	I don't like the fear when I have a cherry I'm like fuck I'm going to break a tooth this
5861000	5864000	time because you bite it and then the seed is so hard.
5864000	5866000	I hate I hate pits.
5866000	5867000	I hate it.
5867000	5873000	I love olives like marinated olives and then sometimes you get them like and then you you
5873000	5876000	you you're like is this better not have a pit in it.
5876000	5877000	I swear to God.
5877000	5881000	And then it has a pit in it and you're like what am I supposed to do with this fucking
5881000	5887000	rock in my mouth and then you spit it into a napkin like an animal and like put it like
5887000	5889000	what are you supposed to do.
5889000	5891000	Why do they why do they have those things.
5891000	5893000	I swallow cherry pits.
5893000	5897000	And then I swallow them all and then when I poop them there's people in New York that
5897000	5904000	make very expensive coffee out of them.
5904000	5905000	You can't even afford it.
5905000	5906000	It's so expensive.
5906000	5910000	It's called Jeff Davis cherry poop coffee.
5910000	5911000	I swallow.
5911000	5916000	Did you have you I don't know if this is an urban legend or not but they say I think this
5916000	5920000	I think this is an urban legend because it started from like urban living and like the
5920000	5925000	the 50s and then it became like a big thing in the 70s the idea that kids were eating
5925000	5930000	cherry pits and they were pooping and that in the sewers there's a whole population of
5930000	5936000	like little George Washington's.
5936000	5937000	Not not cherry trees.
5937000	5941000	Well there are cherry trees obviously a little cherry trees but then there's these little
5941000	5946000	tiny George Washington's.
5946000	5948000	Yeah chopping down the yeah.
5948000	5950000	Are they are they also telling lies.
5950000	5955000	Well that's that's the ironic thing is that I think the whole story is a lie but like
5955000	5960000	within the story no none of them are lying about chopping down the trees.
5960000	5964000	Why in this day and age where our political culture is so bereft of intellect and leadership
5964000	5968000	aren't we cultivating this sewer full of George Washington's.
5968000	5973000	Well because he wasn't really a leader you know he was he was a warrior and he's the
5973000	5976000	he's the he's the leader our nation needed at that time in history but the truth is if
5976000	5982000	you brought George Washington out now first of all he'd be tiny and covered in poop and
5982000	5984000	teeth or wood.
5984000	5988000	Second of all he's just by all accounts he was sort of a you know he was sort of a dumb
5988000	5993000	dumb and just sort of inspiring because he was he was courageous and a good general.
5993000	5996000	Could he do any worse.
5996000	5999000	Could we could we do any worse you're asking.
5999000	6002000	Oh no no he couldn't yeah.
6002000	6007000	Oh yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure of anybody from if you went back in time and pulled anybody
6007000	6012000	from from from back yonder with the I'm sure there would be a couple scandalous remarks
6012000	6016000	that would be like no that's now called anti-Semitism.
6016000	6021000	Like they'll be like oh no I'm sorry I'm from 1921.
6021000	6026000	The but but but as far as their attitude about the role of government I bet we'd be like holy
6026000	6030000	shit this guy's like amazing way back then the office office of the presidency was not
6030000	6032000	not a really prestigious job.
6032000	6033000	Yeah.
6033000	6040000	So they'd be like like they'd you know they'd have that Ross Perot Bernie Sanders charm.
6040000	6044000	No no they'd get they'd be the third party candidate that wasn't allowed in the debates
6044000	6047000	because they'd be like I don't understand why we're talking about this.
6047000	6049000	And we'd be like boo.
6049000	6051000	Did you just fart right now.
6051000	6053000	No that was my mouth.
6053000	6056000	Are you asking was he covering a fire.
6056000	6061000	I sometimes do that like I'll like make like a like a laugh really loud then I'll fart
6061000	6062000	at the same time.
6062000	6067000	It's like I didn't know truth be told that Emily's been farting ever since she sat down
6067000	6069000	up here you go.
6069000	6070000	It's a it's a maelstrom.
6070000	6072000	Well we don't have we don't have much time.
6072000	6077000	I wanted to actually I was actually might have been fruitful to ask Emily as an ambassador
6077000	6083000	and a female gamer like what if a game is really cool but there's like as with Witcher
6083000	6086000	three where it's just like wow this is really cool but it's like this fantasy game and it's
6086000	6092000	just like all of these sorceresses with the cleavage and the kind of like very like mythic
6092000	6098000	gender roles like does that throw the modern I guess the answer is you don't speak for all
6098000	6101000	women like some women are probably totally thrown by that.
6101000	6105000	I feel like yes some women are thrown by that and that's fine and whatever but I'm just
6105000	6112000	like I love tits like I'm I'm I'm sorry like I feel like it's a very bold stance.
6112000	6116000	No it should be a thing that women we're giving boobs.
6116000	6120000	We should be happy and you know what I mean like that's something we should use to our
6120000	6123000	you know it makes cosplaying fun and like all that kind of thing.
6123000	6127000	I think that you know if we're going to get all offended about it.
6127000	6129000	I don't know that's just me.
6129000	6133000	I like I've always wanted to love and love my boobs and I think every woman should.
6133000	6136000	Well I think the counterpoint to that would be yeah.
6136000	6139000	If a woman's going to be offended by it then that's okay you can be entitled to your own
6139000	6142000	opinion but me I'm like girl rock the titties love it.
6142000	6146000	Well I don't think the offense is coming from the exposure of them as if it's like people
6146000	6147000	who are like puritanical.
6147000	6151000	I think it's I think it's it's that there's a fine line but it's like people that are like
6151000	6154000	well there's an objectification happening when they're on display.
6154000	6159000	Yeah it's if it reduces the person's role to a dehumanized role so that they're simply
6159000	6165000	a tray of dessert and if they're not also saying equals MC squared.
6165000	6169000	I don't know but I'm mansplaining.
6169000	6170000	Yeah.
6170000	6172000	And white knighting and Chewbacca.
6172000	6175000	No that's actually very it's in theory knighting.
6175000	6181000	Wimbledoning.
6181000	6184000	I just want to I just thought because it's like it's kind of a straw dog argument.
6184000	6186000	It's like everybody likes boobs.
6186000	6189000	Nobody I don't think any women are like get these things off me.
6189000	6193000	They're terrible and no one's they're terrible evil things and we should never see them.
6193000	6199000	I think I think any any any person who's who's coming down on the other side is more it's
6199000	6205000	it's it's coming more of the angle of like what thoughts that we're putting in people's
6205000	6209000	head about the role of no no no I totally get where you're coming from and and I do
6209000	6214000	think that there is something that is endearing about making a woman be sexy without showing
6214000	6220000	the tits of course like her her her ability to be a badass like you know what's an example
6220000	6225000	of someone there's see whenever I think of games there's just like so many girls to pick boobs.
6225000	6226000	Harriet Tubman.
6226000	6231000	Everywhere.
6231000	6237000	She just farted again.
6237000	6240000	Yeah well yeah nobody nobody's nobody's disagreeing up here.
6240000	6245000	I mean I think that but it's not my job to agree or disagree.
6245000	6248000	I just sit there fart and play the game.
6248000	6250000	The girl she does have that big of boobs and I think she's hot.
6250000	6256000	Yeah well that's the thing that I always find myself wondering as a guy when I when I I always wonder on behalf
6256000	6263000	of men I always wonder why don't we even have to like because I always say like well I used to say before things
6263000	6271000	got so you know I'm like I used to joke to women everything that you need to know about men you can learn from men's
6271000	6283000	prison like the like the like how is it how is that a controversial statement at all like when you when you lock
6283000	6291000	men in a building together and take away all of their wealth and all of their hegemony over society they it turns out that
6291000	6303000	we don't have a lot of like super nuanced needs in order to get an erection or become violent or like we are drones
6303000	6310000	and we turn on each other and ourselves as quickly as we turn on anyone we're allowed to on the outside.
6310000	6315000	So you take away the necktie and you take away the bank and you take away the skyscraper and you take away the history
6315000	6325000	and the momentum and you see what what what what how little men really need to objectify like like we you could you could
6325000	6333000	give a female voice to a banana and the men men would be like I want to fuck that banana because they'll say it eventually
6333000	6342000	about their cellmate like like they they because we're just like biologically we're just kind of drones like we're not so so
6342000	6350000	I always I always wonder in my own head I'm like well you know if the cleavage weren't there like if that's really the issue like
6350000	6357000	or it but it but it but it isn't you know it's like if Mary Curie was like a character in a video game you know it's it's you
6357000	6366000	even more so the whole rule thirty four thing would start applying I don't know if I'm making sense but when there's like a
6366000	6374000	trumpet on parade and it's like she's all dolled up and she's like the cleavage is booming and the thing and it's just like she
6374000	6381000	just looks like she's designed for these thoughts to be thought about her I just I'm always amused by the idea that it's like is that the
6381000	6390000	argument that that overwhelmingly that's almost all of what you see in character a female yeah I guess my thought about it is it's like
6390000	6396000	they're starting to go away from it though they're starting to make it where like girls aren't you know like the Hunger Games and things
6396000	6403000	like that like girls becoming badasses and yeah they're hot but like you know it's it's more like no she's smart and she's got she acts like
6403000	6410000	she she's the one saving the dude because the dudes a dumbass you know what I'm saying right like it's it's not all about oh and she's
6410000	6420000	got a huge rack right and she's like the whole time right I think because those thoughts are like a lot like I draw an analogy between
6420000	6432000	clothing and between clothing and gender roles and language and and race issues like the the the language is certainly a reflection like
6432000	6440000	if all the video games are of women like looking like they're ready to go and they're and they're and they're not saying anything of value on top of that
6440000	6450000	like they have no agency and all that stuff there that's the the clothing is a reflection but I just as you can make genuine racist people use
6450000	6458000	the most polite language in the world yeah and they might be even more racist than ever you could totally like count on men to like be like
6458000	6470000	the clothing is not it's a it's the it's the snot of the cold like you can wipe it all you want like like the virus is more dealt with when you when you talk about
6470000	6478000	characters that have agency and the Bechtel test and stuff like that like that stuff that actually gets the heart of the matter like is the character are people
6478000	6489000	watching characters that happen to share physical characteristics with themselves are they getting trained to think that they hold a certain role in a dynamic like
6489000	6504000	like the clothing is like so secondary to all that and whatever there's no point to it I'm not proposing that anything changed I just kind of amused by the idea that men would men would men would hump a concrete wall like
6504000	6525000	we would not we just don't it's not it's not like that's not where the war is being fought you know yeah there's a lot of armpit fucking in prison wait for real yeah yeah a lot of consensual armpit sex that's that's just good old-fashioned human ingenuity yeah that's
6525000	6549000	invasive the inventions I made when I was 12 years old we've talked about that boy boy oh boy so glad those days are over now you can use like real inventions like buy online things like that yeah I kind of want to make sure my back stays somewhat out of whack
6549000	6570000	now that I'm regaining my memory and bursting into tears I'm worried that I might that they might adjust something and then I'll be like I almost a cliffhanger and end of the show I just remember being 12 years old and like not being able to get through an
6570000	6599000	episode of inspector gadget like just let alone Morgan Mindy let alone anything like I just like everything was like an on fire and it was like not a place to get a lot of work done girls were like that too like well I was at least I was like crazy like my whole family was like that like as soon as we went into puberty I was like what is happening like oh my gosh boobs and craziness and all that stuff but it's just girls
6600000	6625000	yeah like you said girls don't like to talk about it as much but we definitely are the same way I know a lot of women friends of mine that I grew up with and friends I met later that like sort of masturbating a hundred years before I did like yeah I did like second grade but is it I know insane right second grade yeah dude it happens earlier for girls yeah it's weird cuz we mature fast but there's also a lot of accidental masturbating you don't need like
6626000	6643000	no okay second grade there's no such thing as accidental masturbation let me tell you Jeff I'm gonna fuck your armpit so hard tonight right he's doing it right now also also girls girls do that oh here we go
6643000	6672000	I'm gonna talk about this next sentence brought to you by pina colada yeah well I've had a I've had a I'm a politically correct thing to say that that girls do this or do that but I've had a lot of I've had a lot of girlfriends I've had a lot of conversations and I've noticed that girls have a lot of early memories of they practice with you with each other they they got they like like not not no no no I see
6673000	6700000	sorry Emily farted again they play they play they practice they practice kissing and stuff guys don't do that much but I famously told that story of me being like eight years old next to my buddy like humping a couch pillow we're high-fiving each other
6700000	6729000	stack that's the greatest if you're gonna make it was your first guy that's the guy it was Dan ramp stack I don't know what his lawyer's name is but but he's probably watching but that's why I used the wrong name he was he was he was a great dry humper he really let that pillow have it yeah but I mean yeah I mean obviously the the most important thing that people are always so shocked to learn is that if everybody's a little snowflake
6730000	6759880	and it's all so incredibly different it makes us it makes us comfortable to make observations like a girl's do this and guys do this by age 11 and by age 13 and girls do those like but like every conversation you have it's like a second grade and then someone goes oh but Jeff lost his virginity like 32 or whatever like you were a late bloomer 24 and I was 22 yeah and I mean like what that's but that's the and the like the master baiting and the
6759880	6789880	coming in the as we're talking with this I never really thought about this like you like you know like when I came to your house and you had that that that consolidated folder of redheads from Playboy magazines to save space and I was like wow you you should like your redheads you're like oh shit I never really thought about that yes I do I'm looking back like I don't know about for like for young girls certainly not in second grade like for little boys we find the Sears catalog or the or the anything that has a picture of a woman like with any measure of clothing on or none or whatever or a face like it's a visual thing for
6789880	6819880	me anyway and I remember the most potent visual image that I and I saved this picture it was Nadia Komenich the the gymnast like the gold medalist and it's always she Russian it was not a company from Romania I don't know why and it's always like why the fuck do you always again with this fucking shit I don't even know fuck you you guys are fucking but she had all of her clothes on but that she had short
6819880	6849880	hair and like that so like then later on it's like like centuries Audrey Hepburn Mia Farrow like I don't know what it was but it was like my first moments of having like sexual visual like like turn ons was always like like thin never Vava voom never like like super curvy like like like a little wavy like girls with short hair and like that's why is that so strange well why do men like long hair traditionally I know and I
6849880	6879880	or the joke or maybe not joke explanation of like yeah it's like cavemen like wanna handle or something looks like you're more controllable but but I think it's like I think it's like the way cats like like focus on things that move like like like like like like women wear earrings and stuff like like think it's moving around like I think I think I think I think over time maybe that's like a thing that triggers men to like be fascinated like they're like just dogs or cats are just like
6879880	6909880	shaking your head got it if you can't hear in the back is that yeah I'm sure that's absolutely true cuz I just realized cuz we talked about makeup on the show and it's like makeup is like she said she said cuz it's young it's it's a it's young young girls have longer hair and and as women get older they're sure their hair gets more brittle and and unmanageable and they
6909880	6939880	tend to go with the shorter stuff and so yeah everything is sort of every all of our standards for female beauty are somehow rooted in puberty are somehow rooted it like rouge is just flushed cheeks and and lipstick is flushed lips and it's all it's all basically you're you're you spend your life chasing this image of a of the most inappropriate thing in the world which is a a cusping biological female specimen alright Spencer I'm gonna ask you the impossible right now okay but I know that you're up to the task because you are a genius in a show
6939880	6969880	and okay let's do the world's only one liner shadow run where we set it up well I don't want to know but that but I was I was I was pretty content once we could have skipped shadow run but oh yeah yeah yeah I figured once I get to be ten oh five I was like oh kind of paths yeah okay but I was like we're on a roll we're talking about icky stuff alright icky stuff yeah sex is
6969880	6999880	icky yeah when you're when you're a little when you had your first experience with you I was five and I was I went to the school there was a kid on a bus who was older he had just had I went to this amazing school I was a kid and you his birth for his birthday I think he was ten or eleven twelve maybe
6999880	7029880	they had given him his parents had given him a subscription to Playboy for his birthday so this kid so I'd never seen this before and the kid had a thing he wasn't bringing it for show and tell but it was just he had it he was bringing it to the school and it was wrapped in paper and he took it out and he showed it to us and I was like what the hell is that and we just went through it and he explained the whole concept to me and that's sort of what it was and then later that week I think at dinner my parents asked me about school and then they asked
7029880	7059880	me about my you know the every day at dinner and so then they asked me like your birthday's coming up what do you want and I asked for a subscription to Playboy my parents is very measured fashion we're like you know a a what and that's a vision of Playboy and I said do you even know what that is and I went through it so clearly I knew and they said how did you and I so I told them the story I just told you and they said all right well we'll see what we can do and
7059880	7089880	and then in my head I think I mean just being my age now and imagine that them being their age at that time they for whatever reason had to like wait until I left the room and just high five each other and then they get it's all right just to save a couple of little money a little bit of money they gave you a subscription to Muffdiver Sherry or Sherry was some knockoff like like we can't afford that Morgan
7089880	7119880	this area because we were because you remember the episode where we did labyrinth and she was talking about labyrinth but we were I mean she's really like like that movie was like her she was describing like which being in the theater with her parents watching labyrinth and you know at a certain point in that movie like her physically like awakening like her cheeks flushing and like her her nethers tingling and like I call them the nethers because it's like a program
7119880	7149880	it's a mythical and minecraft you go to the nether there's like but she I mean that was like like she can remember the actual like moment of like oh my god my my body and it does like literally happen overnight like like literally overnight like puberty happened a friend of mine Samantha she was like eleven or twelve went to a Prince concert and she's told me she's like I was standing there watching Prince on stage and she goes and I had an orgasm I wasn't touching myself I just stood there and she's like I didn't know what was
7149880	7179880	happening but later on I would come to understand like what that was my first time I came just by standing there watching this dude right I definitely know I was watching Morgan Mindy I was like I was watching Pam Dauber and I was like but I was like I think I could have been watching anything because it was really more about like I was like laying I would lay supine is that what it's called on your stomach and I was like laying after school alone and my mom's apartment and like so and I was just like watching work in Mindy and it's
7179880	7209880	just going like this and I was like and then and then I was just like kept doing it and I was like nothing get your chips ready everybody get those chips ready and nothing nothing that you know I looked I looked to see if anything had because I was like is that what I think that was nothing had happened but it felt like something that you would
7209880	7239880	want to do forever so yeah so I have that and then from that moment until around thirty nine I like I pretty much was just like dedicated to making that feeling happen over and over again and I because I remember like that very week or like like within it within a few days it was like like I'm just gonna keep doing this over and over again and I remember being really excited that nothing was I'm getting really graphic but let's let's stay safe and stop now the
7239880	7269880	I just I remember being really stoked that nothing was coming out because I thought I was like cheating the system because I was like I wasn't touching myself which I had already had like shame loaded into my mind about like that one day I was gonna start touching myself and that that was my mom would would say like it's gonna be a natural thing it was like I don't want to think about my mom giving me permission to touch myself and so I was like I didn't touch myself I just humped a pillow and thought about Pam Dauber and then I had this amazing feeling
7269880	7299880	I'm like I'm the king of the world like and I would just like run home from school as fast as I could all my friends would be like don't you want to stay and talk about hello cool Jake man he's so dedicated to his schoolwork now and I was just like slam lock the door and it's like and then slowly but surely it was just like starting with like one little drop coming out I just remember like every every successive like little
7299880	7329880	and I'm telling you for those eleven-year-olds listening it's all downhill from there just just just keep doing that and like don't involve other people we have eight billion too many and just eat cookies and all right well we got to the bottom of some stuff I think
7329880	7357420	typically stuff that we've already gotten to the bottom of I guess but it's worth worth going there again sometimes I think it was a nice introspective there's no losers in it yeah we got to meet Emily who's fantastic we got a we got a show a good shot of vitamin D from Dave Klein man he's always
7359880	7360880	but you know I've always had it was like like like it's a thing there's a problem with me is like I always like when I when I was a kid on the playground and people would pick up me I would never cry and then when the guy would come over and say stop picking on him I'd start bawling because I feel so ashamed of myself for needing to be stuck up for and so when Dave Dave came up and was like come on Hulk a maniac it's not that bad a show I almost started crying it's terrible it's that bad a show I said we I said we end the show playing
7389880	7419880	the tie breaks and theme song while you body surf and fart all over the entire body surf and fart body surf and fart don't set me up for failure you know that my back is hamburger to be rolled gently through human hands you've obviously never had actual back problems in your life how about some good old-fashioned butt chugging it can't hurt man
