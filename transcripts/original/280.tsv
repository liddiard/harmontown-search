0	14400	Kiss Me on Monday from beautiful uptown, Burbank.
14400	16800	Harman Town is now in session.
16800	22000	Please welcome to the stage your Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Fincher.
22000	29000	What you got in that bag?
29000	32000	Go to your mayor of Harman Town, you know him.
32000	36000	His name is Dan Harman.
36000	38000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
38000	42000	Wrap it to the flow, wrap it to the beat, wrap it all night.
42000	45000	Gonna eat some meat, add some veggies, what can I say?
45000	48000	I like a full plate all day.
48000	50000	My name's Mr. Eating.
50000	52000	I'm made of a mouth and a stomach.
52000	57000	I like to eat things with the former and swallow them down to the latter.
57000	61000	Fuck your mom so hard that her pussy turned into pancake batter.
61000	66000	Put it in a pan, turn it into discs, eat it down with a swish of red wine.
66000	71000	Cause I'm a functional alcoholic, in the morning I'm calling you.
71000	76000	For brunch, for a lady or two, mimosas, yeah.
77000	79000	Samosas? No.
79000	80000	That's Indian.
80000	84000	Alright, welcome to Harman Town.
84000	87000	Is it me, Dan? Are you getting better at freestyle?
87000	90000	I think you're finding your flow.
90000	92000	I think I'm getting worse at freestyle.
92000	99000	I think I'm getting better at focusing in on the 90 words that rhyme with each other.
99000	102000	Maybe Eminem feels the same way.
102000	104000	No, he doesn't, cause he'll say,
104000	109000	stole your mama's Acura, wrecked it, gave it back to her.
109000	114000	You don't know that Acura rhymes with back to her, unless you're a true rapper.
114000	119000	Like I'm just thinking, I just learned to stay away from the word.
119000	122000	Just, not in a tempo, just rhyme,
122000	129000	be Eminem for a minute and just try to freestyle rhymes for Acura that are kind of loosely rhyming.
129000	131000	I don't know, Scott Bakula.
131000	133000	Yeah, that's great.
133000	135000	Sure, guys, sure. I mean, obviously...
135000	137000	So you can do it. You have that muscle too.
137000	139000	Now let's hit that beat again.
139000	141000	Put that beat back up.
141000	142000	Now just let it...
142000	144000	So just be phonetic. Just think phonetically.
144000	146000	No, well just do better.
146000	149000	Just be real good to true rhymes.
149000	151000	So you guys, you have my best interest too.
151000	152000	Absolutely.
152000	155000	You know, this isn't some kind of sideshow.
155000	157000	No, that's not true at all.
157000	158000	I'm supporting you right now.
158000	162000	In order for me to be better at what I do and to feel better about myself,
162000	164000	you guys want me to just do another rap.
164000	165000	No, no, no.
165000	166000	Where I just don't...
166000	167000	We're trying to ruin you.
167000	171000	We're trying to destroy your career tonight through rap.
171000	176000	Spencer and I have been waiting three and a half years for this very moment to take you down.
176000	177000	Tonight is the night.
177000	179000	Let's just do, come on, give me a beat.
180000	181000	Yo.
181000	182000	Yo.
182000	183000	Yo.
183000	184000	Whoa.
184000	185000	Yo.
185000	186000	Whoa.
186000	187000	Go.
187000	188000	Yo.
188000	189000	Yo.
189000	190000	Up and down.
190000	191000	The snow blow.
191000	192000	Yeah.
192000	193000	Snow blower in the driveway.
193000	194000	Gonna fuck your mama.
194000	195000	Gonna do it the right way.
195000	196000	See, I can't...
196000	197000	Yeah, you did it.
197000	198000	Did I point it in the right way?
198000	199000	Oh, I did?
199000	200000	Yeah.
200000	201000	That's doing it?
201000	202000	That's the same thing it was doing before.
202000	203000	That's the same thing it was doing before.
203000	204000	It's the same thing it was doing before.
204000	206000	But you said that accurate scottvaculo right away, right away.
206000	207000	Okay.
208000	209000	We got a big show tonight.
209000	210000	We got a lot of guests.
210000	211000	We got a lot of old friends.
211000	213000	We got better shit to do than to fuck with me.
213000	215000	No one's fucking with you, Dan.
215000	216000	We're here to support you.
216000	218000	Maybe I've been drinking.
218000	224000	One of the only topic that I have to address tonight is I want to talk about prostate massage.
224000	225000	Thank God.
225000	230000	So if you think that we can get through everything else we have to do tonight and still address
230000	235000	it, why don't we get that out of the way and leave the prostate massage and then we'll
235000	236000	bring our guests up.
236000	238000	We're going to need a lot of time for this, I think.
238000	242000	Are you saying do we want the guests on stage for this prostate massage conversation?
242000	244000	Well, I guess let's bring up Rob Schrab.
244000	246000	Rob Schrab!
249000	254000	I'm not saying he's the prostate massage of guests or that he's an expert in it.
260000	261000	Rob Schrab.
261000	262000	Hello.
262000	264000	Oh, yeah.
265000	267000	We've got Beard Grow and Schrab.
267000	268000	Always a pleasure.
268000	269000	Yeah.
269000	270000	This is my Logan phase.
270000	271000	Like it.
271000	272000	Jealous.
272000	273000	Jealous of its lustrousness.
273000	275000	What phase is Jeff going through?
275000	277000	You got a haircut.
277000	279000	Yeah, I'm going through my haircut phase.
279000	280000	That's a good one.
280000	283000	You're a Guy Pearce phase.
283000	288000	I'm going through my LA confidential five and under phase.
288000	289000	All right.
289000	293000	Well, if you're a fan of mine, and you are, one of the things that you know about me is
293000	299000	that once in the late 90s, I experimented having heard about the stimulation of the
299000	305000	prostate as an extra option at the country buffet of jerking off.
305000	311000	I took a Sharpie pen and put the non-cap end up my rectum while jerking off, which I usually
311000	312000	do on my knees anyway.
312000	317000	So I was kneeling on a pen and kind of like moving it around.
317000	320000	And it did feel a little extra good.
320000	323000	And I came the way I usually do through my penis.
323000	324000	Oh.
324000	328000	And then I never, that was the last time I did it because then I had come and I was kneeling
328000	330000	on my bed with a pen up my ass.
330000	334000	Was there a mirror in front of you?
334000	339000	No, that's not something that I think would ever add for me to the sexual experience.
339000	342000	Well, I don't think you would put it there on purpose.
342000	343000	There I am.
343000	347000	There you are, air wolf.
348000	351000	So I always thought of it like, okay, guys have assholes.
351000	352000	Yeah.
352000	353000	Women have assholes.
353000	354000	True.
354000	355000	Everyone has an asshole.
355000	357000	And that guys, because they're homophobic.
357000	360000	Assholes are Mars, vaginas are Venus, I think.
360000	367000	That guys, because they're homophobic, we just associate, we've been socialized to not
367000	369000	be like, what are you doing with my butthole?
369000	373000	And then other people would be like, no, there's just as many nerve endings up there as there
373000	376000	isn't the outside of your dick or the pussy.
376000	377000	Like, whatever.
377000	383000	It's all science and I've been content to be like, yeah, I'm not interested in anal
383000	389000	things or anything, but the, so here I just typed it in and I don't know why.
389000	392000	Because I remember a conversation with a friend of mine.
392000	393000	Me.
393000	394000	Who, no.
394000	398000	Well, there was, that was the first prostate conversation I ever had was with a shrub.
398000	399000	Put a pin in that.
399000	404000	I'll put a sharpie in that.
404000	411520	And I remember a writer on one of my empire's shows, like going like, well, have you ever
411520	414400	had your prostate milked?
414400	415400	And I went, no.
415400	419680	And he's like, yeah, I did that with so and so, his girlfriend.
419680	424440	And so they, you know, and then he described this thing and it was like, yeah, you said
424440	429200	prostate milk, so I'm not going to, I'm just going to support you.
429200	431560	And I'll think about it later.
431560	433580	So then I googled it.
433580	437940	So your prostate is, first of all, women don't have them.
437940	438940	Did you know that?
438940	439940	No.
439940	440940	Yeah.
440940	441940	I just found that out.
441940	442940	Pretty, pretty sure.
442940	443940	I guess they don't die of prostate.
443940	444940	I figured that out in my head.
444940	445940	They don't, they don't die of prostate.
445940	446940	They never do.
446940	448900	Well, you know what the prostate does, right?
448900	452740	It, it, it, well, it doesn't, it's the muscle, it's the pump on the aquarium.
452740	458620	It keeps, I mean, it puts the pee out, it releases for the pee to come out.
458620	464180	And then it, and then it pumps your, your, a third of your, it does the whole pumping
464180	472500	motion of everything that gets, makes everything go out provides as a gland, a third of the
472500	475540	total seminal ingredients of seminal fluid.
475540	476540	Hell yeah.
476540	483780	So apparently the prostate, but it builds shit up, but I don't know if these are websites
483780	492380	that are just selling anal tools and dressing the whole, cause they're all kind of geocities
492380	495900	looking and there's like a gift of a nurse, you're like, like going like, yeah, this is
495900	496900	important for you.
496900	499100	Are these sponsored ads that you're reading or like?
499100	500100	I don't know how I got it.
500100	506660	I think I typed prostate milking into Google and then I started surfing as the kids call
506660	507660	it.
507660	508660	Image search.
508660	509660	On the reg.
509660	515140	And I, and what, what the people that would keep in mind, these are people who are selling
515140	517580	you things that you put in your butt.
517580	519700	So they want you to put something in your butt.
519700	520940	I don't know.
520940	522060	They might be on the side.
522060	525100	It's in their best interest that you put something in your right.
525100	526100	Okay.
526100	531100	So this thing is run by big butt stuff, big butt stuff.
531100	536140	But apparently I never, when I put the Sharpie in my butt, I wasn't doing it right because
536140	541660	you can go to Reddits where people are talking about the prostate orgasm, like the milky
541660	542660	prostate.
542660	546660	Like you put something in your butt and you wiggle it around the right way.
546660	552380	You like massage the prostate from the inside of your butthole and eventually you'll have
552380	558580	an almost to a guy, what feels like an involuntary shuttering orgasm, right?
558580	564140	That has nothing to do with when you do the other thing that's like a different thing
564140	568180	where you're like, whoa, and there's like an earthquake.
568180	571500	And then there's guys on subreddits going like, trust me.
571500	572500	Like I get it.
572500	575140	You don't want to put a thing in your butt.
575140	581820	But guys, and I just am 45 years old and I just encountered it.
581820	583900	Should we make podcast history right now?
583900	589100	Well, I think we need, we'll make podcast history next week.
589100	599140	When you said earlier that when you put the Sharpie in your butt, did you, and you said
599140	604420	you did it wrong, what's the right way to stick a Sharpie in your butt?
604420	606100	That's what I was pushing back against.
606100	607100	You did it just fine.
607100	608100	Don't worry.
608100	609100	Well, no, I did everything.
609100	610100	As long as you didn't hurt yourself.
610100	611100	Everyone that does something does something.
611100	613100	Well, you came, didn't you?
613100	614980	Sharpie wasn't designed to milk your prostate.
614980	619540	When guys are talking about putting stuff in their butts, they're not just saying, oh,
619540	623140	there's a hole there that feels good when you stick stuff in it.
623140	625780	There's also a thing, there's a G-spot in there.
625780	627580	Let's not rush too quickly past.
627580	629340	You can like rub, what?
629340	631220	It's great to put stuff in your butt.
631220	632220	Sure.
632220	633220	Everyone loves it.
633220	634220	It's great to put stuff in your ear too.
634220	637180	You don't need to build nothing to just shove a bunch of shit up your ass.
637180	642620	It's great to let your cat outside, but you're not supposed to do that.
642620	647580	It's great to have a milkshake for dinner.
647580	648580	Yeah.
648580	649580	I mean, look.
649580	650580	What is this?
650580	653020	You like going through some shit?
653020	658220	I add ice cream and apple pie for breakfast.
658220	659220	Oh, boy.
659220	665660	What if that was the end of the podcast?
665660	668020	We just actually, it was the first 11 minutes.
668020	669020	I'm not going to talk about that.
669020	670020	Great if we had credits to roll.
670020	671020	Bob, are you lying?
672020	673020	Did you really have that?
673020	674020	No, I ate it.
674020	677020	Why would he make that up and then do that mic drop?
677020	688020	Both vegan ice cream and vegan cake, both gotten from whole foods where they sell the
688020	690020	whole food.
690020	695020	If you wanted to get 2% of milk, they would just give you the whole milk.
695020	699020	If you wanted to get half a sandwich, they would say, no.
699020	702020	You have to take the whole sandwich.
702020	708020	If you wanted to have, you know, like Reese's Pieces, no.
708020	711020	You have to have the whole Reese's.
711020	713020	This is whole foods.
713020	719020	We don't have pieces or halves or 2% of anything here.
719020	720020	You want grapes?
720020	721020	Sure.
721020	725020	That's the gimmick of the store is that the only milk is 100% milk.
725020	726020	Yeah.
726020	728020	It's the whole food.
728020	732020	Let's say I walked into Whole Foods and said, I do some half and half.
732020	734020	No, go across the street.
734020	738020	Tell you what, you can have two gallons of it and you can mix them together.
738020	742020	Yeah, in one gallon because we're going to give you the whole milk.
742020	744020	I have to take one half.
744020	748020	Can I buy the one half of the one part of it and the other half of the other part of it?
748020	750020	I'll have to talk to my manager.
750020	752020	It sounds like what your kitchen is.
752020	754020	It's called being a fur trapper.
754020	756020	That's what the store would become.
756020	761020	It would become a trading post where a guy draped in fur was like, what do you want?
761020	766020	You want a cow udder filled with everything milk has in it before you remove some?
766020	769020	Or would you like a shoe made out of a log?
769020	771020	Because a shoe is, what is that?
771020	773020	That's just a pared down log.
773020	775020	Your plan is bullshit.
775020	778020	Whatever you want, you can't have it.
778020	781020	It's not how it works.
782020	786020	So they say the prostate is like a plum sized, like, growth.
786020	787020	A plum sized?
787020	788020	Well, not a growth.
788020	789020	It's like a plum.
789020	793020	They say it's the size of a plum that if you put something in your butt, like a finger,
793020	798020	like your own finger, you can reach up toward your belly button and you can feel something
798020	800020	the size of a plum.
800020	802020	I'm sure you can feel all sorts of stuff.
802020	805020	And they say don't rub the middle of it.
805020	807020	Don't rub the middle of it.
807020	808020	Don't rub the middle of it?
808020	809020	It hates that.
809020	810020	It's like a clove.
810020	813020	It's like a hemisphere.
813020	815020	Like don't rub the middle.
815020	818020	The middle hurts more than it does anything.
818020	819020	It's got lobes.
819020	822020	The idea is that you get your prostate, it's more than a muscle.
822020	823020	It's like a factory.
823020	826020	It's making a third of your cum.
826020	828020	I mean, it's mostly a factor.
828020	829020	I'm surprised.
829020	833020	Like the way that you know it is this urine pump is very strange to me.
833020	836020	I don't want to use this card, but I grew up in the 80s.
836020	837020	Right.
837020	838020	Yeah.
838020	839020	It's interesting to bump against that.
839020	843020	All we had to know, Spencer, when I was your age, you know what we had to know?
843020	844020	What?
844020	845020	Who forms the head in Voltron?
845020	846020	That's what we had to know.
846020	847020	Yeah.
847020	848020	Who forms the head in Voltron?
848020	849020	You know, the yellow lion probably.
849020	850020	No.
850020	851020	Well, whatever!
851020	854020	You know, why don't you shoot up a school?
854020	856020	I thought of it.
856020	857020	All right.
857020	858020	All right.
858020	859020	You know what?
859020	860020	Why don't the rest of you put it on the comment card?
860020	861020	Okay.
861020	862020	They probably will.
862020	863020	No, that's good.
863020	864020	All right.
864020	865020	I was saying that his generation...
866020	868020	You can't say that that came out of me.
868020	870020	I was accusing him of it.
870020	871020	Yeah.
871020	880020	Who do you think was the Christopher Columbus of prostate massage?
880020	886020	Well, remember you told me that when you rub the...
886020	887020	Daint?
887020	888020	Daint.
888020	889020	Daint, yeah.
889020	890020	It like...
890020	891020	It what?
891020	892020	It does what?
892020	893020	Now I just do it.
893020	894020	I've been doing it 25 years ago.
894020	896020	25 years of coming and now I just...
896020	899020	My hand goes there because Rob Schwab told me something once.
899020	900020	So I'm just always...
900020	902020	Please don't be thinking about that while you're doing it.
902020	903020	Hell yeah.
903020	904020	Oh, yeah.
904020	905020	Schwab.
905020	907020	I also think of Schwab advice while I'm masturbating.
907020	908020	I don't do it anymore.
908020	910020	I haven't done it in too much work.
910020	915020	I have one story about this, but I feel weird telling it because church is sitting right
915020	916020	there.
916020	917020	Oh, don't say it.
917020	918020	It's like...
918020	919020	She's not listening.
919020	920020	Church?
920020	922020	Church, do you want to step outside?
923020	924020	No, church didn't do it.
924020	926020	This is like from when I was 19.
926020	927020	Oh, to be quiller.
927020	929020	I didn't think the church did it.
929020	930020	Yeah.
930020	936020	There was a girl when I was like 22 who got right up in there with her finger and did
936020	937020	something.
937020	938020	I don't know what she did.
938020	941020	I couldn't describe if there was lobes or clothes or whatever, the flim flam.
941020	947020	But all I know is I came for three days, like a laser beam.
947020	948020	Wait, for three days?
948020	951020	No, it was not like a regular pulsing guy.
951020	960020	It was just like this, like the Death Star blowing up Alderaan.
960020	965020	It was just a giant focused beam of orgasm.
965020	969020	She went up there and found this magic button up my butthole.
969020	970020	She went up there.
970020	971020	Well, I never knew there were different things.
971020	972020	Go ahead.
972020	974020	Look, you seem exasperated, which is insane.
974020	977020	Yeah, Jeff, that story really put Shrobb out.
977020	982020	I just I was holding my breath for a while because you want to talk.
982020	983020	No, I didn't.
983020	984020	No, I didn't.
984020	985020	I had nothing to say.
985020	986020	All right.
986020	988020	Well, what did you want?
988020	989020	What am I doing wrong?
989020	990020	Dan?
990020	991020	How do you want me to sit differently?
991020	992020	Jeff is talking.
992020	993020	You want me to change the lighting?
993020	994020	What?
994020	995020	What am I doing wrong?
995020	996020	How can I make you happy?
996020	997020	You seem crazy.
997020	998020	You were acting crazy.
998020	1001020	You were like, you were like, no, I'm not even.
1001020	1003020	He was like, he was like, I don't know.
1003020	1006020	He was like, this is not how prostate touching should be.
1006020	1008020	And I'm about to explain what it should be.
1008020	1009020	Right.
1009020	1010020	OK, thank you, then.
1010020	1011020	I'm sorry.
1011020	1012020	I threw you under the bus and pretended you were a clone.
1012020	1013020	I'm not.
1013020	1014020	Yeah.
1014020	1015020	I picked up that signal from two.
1015020	1017020	I thought that you had something to say about it.
1017020	1018020	Yeah.
1018020	1019020	No.
1019020	1020020	How much stuff have you ever put in your butt?
1020020	1021020	At the same time.
1021020	1022020	What effect?
1022020	1023020	To what effect?
1023020	1028020	Well, I told you about the time when the doctor put the thing on my butt when I was asleep
1028020	1031020	that I woke up woke woke up in the middle of it.
1031020	1032020	They were making fun of you.
1032020	1034020	No, they weren't.
1034020	1036020	I was I pretended to be asleep, though.
1036020	1038020	But it's because they were making fun.
1038020	1040020	No, I was pretending to.
1040020	1041020	You heard him.
1041020	1045020	Dan, you're misremembering.
1045020	1052020	I pretended to be asleep so I could find out if they were making fun of me.
1052020	1053020	And they never did.
1053020	1054020	They never did.
1054020	1061020	But then somebody sent like all of us like, hey, man records on his phone.
1061020	1065020	The doctor is making fun of him while he is sleeping.
1065020	1068020	Three Rob Shrobs stories back to back.
1068020	1072020	This is for the people who haven't just finished listening to 350 episodes in a row.
1072020	1074020	Like, I'm going to go fast for you guys.
1074020	1077020	But if this is your first time here and you're.
1077020	1079020	Pretend there's a snowstorm.
1079020	1080020	Why Rob Shrobs?
1080020	1083020	Here's the three best Rob Shrobs stories in the world.
1083020	1085020	First one is Shrobs.
1085020	1086020	Shrobs.
1086020	1088020	There was a wait.
1088020	1090020	Well, let's start with that one so that people don't think I'm insane.
1090020	1096020	We were just saying like you're leaving me hanging.
1096020	1097020	OK.
1097020	1098020	All right.
1098020	1099020	All right.
1099020	1101020	You're pointing and I don't know what that means.
1101020	1102020	All right.
1102020	1103020	OK.
1103020	1104020	OK.
1104020	1105020	OK.
1105020	1106020	I'm sorry.
1106020	1107020	But Shrobs.
1107020	1108020	You know, so there's this song called Space Oddity.
1108020	1109020	Was that the 80s song coming?
1109020	1110020	Major Tom.
1110020	1111020	Are you receiving?
1111020	1112020	No, that's.
1112020	1113020	Major Tom.
1113020	1114020	That's the difference.
1114020	1115020	Hard on that Space Oddity.
1115020	1116020	It's the other.
1116020	1117020	It's called like Major Tom.
1118020	1119020	Five.
1119020	1120020	Three.
1120020	1121020	Two.
1121020	1122020	One.
1122020	1123020	Yes.
1123020	1124020	Yeah.
1124020	1125020	Yeah.
1125020	1126020	I've told the story before.
1126020	1130020	So there's a there's a verse in the song when the astronaut is like he's drifting into space
1130020	1135020	and he goes and then and then they go across the stratosphere.
1135020	1140020	The signal comes in and this is Major Tom communicating to ground control.
1140020	1145020	He goes give my wife my love then nothing more.
1145020	1152020	And and that's the dramatic point where they lose contact with Major Tom and Shrobs thought
1152020	1156020	that that was Major Tom saying don't fuck my wife.
1156020	1157020	Yeah.
1157020	1158020	Yeah.
1158020	1161020	Give my wife my love not yours.
1161020	1162020	Jeremy.
1162020	1166020	Give my wife my love and leave it at that Kyle.
1166020	1170020	Just give her the message and take her home.
1170020	1171020	OK.
1171020	1172020	You know.
1172020	1173020	Yeah.

1225180	1226340	If you just pour it over it is just become like velvet.
1226340	1227340	Yeah.
1227340	1228340	No you're right.
1228340	1229340	You're right.

1249180	1256460	all you know I'm just I'm just I just think it's funny that.
1256460	1260700	After all this time it turns out if you stick a finger up your ass you have a different
1260700	1265940	kind of orgasm that has nothing to do with your other orgasm.
1265940	1267660	Are you going to explore this at home?
1267660	1270340	I don't I don't know about that.
1270340	1272980	I'll update my podcast audiences I always have.
1272980	1281620	Sounds to me that if it was as good as you're claiming to be you would do it again.
1281620	1282620	You don't know.
1282620	1287340	No I'm saying like when I did it with the Sharpie I didn't do I didn't do it I didn't
1287340	1288340	do this.
1288340	1290100	I thought you said you just recently.
1290100	1292180	No I didn't do I was reading about it.
1292180	1296580	Go to the pleasure go to the pleasure chest in West Hollywood and go in into the toy room
1296580	1301020	and talk to the people that work there and say hey I've heard about this prostate thing
1301020	1303620	for a gentleman.
1303620	1308300	What's the story on that and they will walk you into a little chamber of like or down
1308300	1309300	an aisle.
1309300	1315300	I think this is the stuff that you or your partner can put up your butthole and is going
1315300	1316300	to make you come.
1316300	1319100	Jeff I don't want to cut you off there but if we're going to talk to anybody about this
1319100	1320460	we should bring up Demarche Brown.
1320460	1325100	Demarche Brown knows about butt stuff.
1325100	1331100	Demarche Brown for the butt stuff segment.
1331100	1334180	It's time to go deep.
1334180	1340500	First let's just talk about the world's greatest intros throughout history.
1340500	1345940	Okay Jesus entering on a donkey Palm Sunday right.
1345940	1346940	That was a good intro.
1346940	1351220	Elvis parachuting into the Rose Bowl.
1351220	1360220	Demarche Brown being announced on Harman Town in association with anal stimulation.
1360220	1365940	Darth Vader coming through the door in a new hope.
1365940	1366940	Demarche.
1366940	1367940	That's all of them.

1375340	1376340	What have you heard Demarche?
1376340	1381620	I'd rather hear what you've heard.
1381620	1390580	It's only going to get better if you go like, well I heard a rumor, a good.
1390580	1395980	I have friends and it comes up in conversation and they talk about it and I kind of just
1395980	1398860	sit there and go I have no idea what you're talking about but then they spill their guts
1398860	1403460	and name one gut spill.
1403460	1405020	It's not supposed to work like that.
1405020	1406020	Yeah.
1406020	1407020	Okay.
1407020	1408020	I'm just saying.
1408020	1409020	Just tell us.
1409020	1415540	You don't have to tell us about the real thing as far as I'm concerned, it's very real.
1415540	1428060	Tell us the one story that made you go, Oh, somebody told you like a, like a butt story
1428060	1436020	that made you go, whoa, what the, what the, what are you talking about?
1436020	1441580	Just tell any stories that made you have that reaction because it doesn't have to be about
1441580	1442580	myself.
1442580	1449220	Like any story that made you go, Oh, what are you talking about?
1449220	1450220	Whoa.
1450220	1451220	All right.
1451220	1452220	I get it.
1452220	1453220	I get it.
1453220	1456900	World star sort of thing.
1456900	1462060	There was this story, I think in part was because I was 17, I think when I heard it,
1462060	1469580	but there was a friend of ours whose older brother went to college and he came back one
1469580	1474940	Thanksgiving, I think, and had a story about a formal, these formal dances where the women
1474940	1478620	would, you know, the guy would ask a girl out or a girl would ask a guy out depending
1478620	1481340	on who's, who was the host of the party.
1481340	1485360	And the idea was you would meet and have wine and cheese and crackers and talk around
1485360	1487020	cocktails and do whatever.
1487020	1491680	And then all hop on a chartered coach to go to a resort somewhere for a big party that
1491680	1497500	involved a dinner with several forks and knives and, uh, this is a story about butt sex.
1497500	1501980	This is, oh, oh, it's getting, you're, you're doing your job perfectly.
1501980	1507580	This is a classier lead up to a butt fun story than the toast master brought me up here.
1507580	1508580	You're doing everything right.
1508580	1511820	Everyone fucked up but me, keep going, keep going.
1511820	1517900	So, uh, this guy tells us a story and he's, keep in mind, he's like probably 19 talking
1517900	1521380	to 17 year olds and he's only talking to me and my friend, he kicked everybody else out
1521380	1522380	of the room.
1522380	1524300	He's like, this happened to me and this is, I don't know, you know, it's just, here's
1524300	1525300	a story.
1525300	1529860	Uh, and also made the guy almost made the, my friend almost sign up a blood contract
1529860	1532580	not to don't tell mom and dad and that kind of stuff.
1532580	1537820	And he said that, uh, he went on a date, um, we asked this girl or was asked by this girl
1537820	1543060	to a formal and he goes to the formal, he gets a nice suit, goes to the party, talks
1543060	1546780	about a bunch of the idiots there that are like sort of trying to chat him up and see
1546780	1552500	if he has the qualities to work in finance or whatever older guys are, uh, they all get
1552500	1553500	in a charter.
1553500	1554500	They go to the thing.
1554500	1555500	The girl's very nice conversation.
1555500	1556500	It's awesome.
1556500	1569380	Sorry, that's a, that's our very tone deaf, um, uh, uh, Foley guy, he doesn't, he doesn't
1569380	1572940	have an expansive library and he doesn't have very good timing.
1572940	1581020	Am I still going, yeah, there's a, we're two, we're two realities deeper.
1581020	1586060	People get on a charter or is it that it doesn't, you said the story came from a person that
1586060	1589900	where you had to go on a plane to get, no, not a charter plane, a charter bus.
1589900	1590900	These are college students.
1590900	1591900	Oh, okay.
1591900	1592900	Yeah.
1592900	1593900	Start over.
1593900	1595900	But the way you met the guy that's telling the story is you were on a plane.
1595900	1596900	No, no, no, no.
1596900	1600540	I'm his, his little brother's friend and he comes back from Thanksgiving to tell us a
1600540	1601540	story.
1601540	1602540	Okay.
1602540	1603540	That's all it is.
1603540	1605740	And he's saying, so he's telling, he's kicked everybody out of the room except that us at
1605740	1608380	this party and he's saying, you know, here's the thing.
1608380	1609380	Here's what college is like.
1609380	1611340	That was his, that was the funny thing about what he was saying.
1611340	1614820	So he was telling the story and he just said that he went through this with this girl that
1614820	1616060	had a great time at dinner.
1616060	1617580	Uh, they both got liquored up.
1617580	1621740	They both decided to leave before the charter was going back, got a taxi or something to
1621740	1622940	take them back.
1622940	1626500	And uh, she takes them back to his room and they, you know, they do what people do.
1626500	1629100	They get down, so to speak.
1629100	1635900	Um, and the guy wakes up the next day, uh, at daylight just as a crack of daylight and
1635900	1639020	realizes that he's covered in excrement.
1639020	1640020	What?
1640020	1641020	His entire, like everything.
1641020	1643520	Oh boy.
1643520	1646160	And um, he doesn't know what to do.
1646160	1650080	So he sort of gently wakes a girl up and then she sees that she's, oh my God, I have something
1650080	1653720	to tell you, but we got to deal with this first because everybody else has come back
1653720	1654720	after them.
1654720	1656440	They're, it's, they're the only ones awake at this point.
1656440	1661440	And they go through this sort of like horrific Swiss family Robinson thing of like taking
1661440	1663560	each piece and figuring out a way to get rid of it.
1663560	1664560	The mattress had to go out.
1664560	1665560	There's all this stuff.
1665560	1666560	Wait a minute.
1666560	1667560	Wait a minute.
1667560	1668560	So, so where did they go?
1668560	1671520	They went back to her place, obviously roommates.
1671520	1672520	Yes.
1672520	1673520	Okay.
1673520	1674520	It's a nonlinear story.
1674520	1678200	He's, he, the protagonist also doesn't know what you don't know.
1678200	1683760	You're asking questions that he's going to answer at the time to listen, right?
1683760	1684760	Yeah.
1684760	1685760	Listen to the story.
1685760	1686760	It's a nonlinear story.
1686760	1687760	It's not linear.
1687760	1688760	It was not linear.
1688760	1689760	And I was confused.
1689760	1690760	Oh, I'm sorry.
1690760	1691760	It's like momentum.
1691760	1696720	You just interrupted a nonlinear year ago to go like what he's a fish.
1696720	1697720	Like yeah.
1697720	1699240	Let him fucking craft his web.
1699240	1700240	We know he's a fish.
1700240	1701240	All right.
1701240	1706120	The other one is this, that, uh, everything was cool at the end of it, but they had to,
1706120	1710480	um, she had to tell him after they got everything settled, they left and went for coffee.
1710480	1712760	And now I'm lost.
1712760	1713760	I have so many questions.
1713760	1715720	They really had to clean up what he woke up.
1715720	1716720	Okay.
1716720	1717720	He's doing it to fuck a shot.
1717720	1718720	Whose poop was it?
1718720	1719720	Was it his or somebody else's?
1719720	1720720	It was hers.
1720720	1721720	You're about to find out it was hers.
1721720	1722720	Okay.
1722720	1723720	Yeah.
1723720	1728680	She has to tell him that she discovered in high school that she had a natural reaction
1728680	1733840	to specifically what you were talking about, which is that she has this sort of super orgasm,
1733840	1744560	but then she, her body vents itself or evacuates itself with that.
1744560	1747680	Maybe she'd have said, Hey, just so you know, don't freak out.
1747680	1748840	I didn't ask to come up here, man.
1748840	1756360	But if I come, I might shit all over you, the bed, the living room, sleep in it too.
1756360	1757800	I have to get rid of the bed.
1757800	1760280	He was saying the girl should have led with that at the time.
1760280	1761280	He wasn't saying you shouldn't know.
1761280	1762280	I know.
1762280	1763280	I was trying to.
1763280	1764280	He wasn't getting you a note.
1764280	1766600	So he, he fucked this chick and she pooped her.
1766600	1768720	She pooped the whole everything.
1768720	1775920	She came so hard at the point where she fucked the shit out of her and immediately went to
1775920	1776920	sleep.
1776920	1777920	Goodnight.
1777920	1778920	Everybody.
1778920	1780680	How do you, you gotta be pretty tired.
1780680	1785520	I mean, I'll say, I'll look, I'll say we have to be tired to go to sleep.
1785520	1787480	Both people everywhere.
1787480	1794040	Both people, both people, both people like she didn't go, Oh God, I just shot all over
1794040	1801120	his balls, his stomach, his neck and his, and his sheets and everything.
1801120	1806160	But I'm just, we got just a little sleepy.
1806160	1810720	I'm just going to, I'm just going to knock off right now.
1810720	1811720	Namaste.
1812720	1818720	Can we at least drop $50 on an actual soundboard or something?
1818720	1828520	Like this, I know I'm a man of the people, it's a, it's just the sounds are, are they,
1828520	1831240	they raise more questions than they answer.
1831240	1834320	Sounds like your, your complaints are unpopular.
1834320	1835320	It does.
1835320	1837320	But please continue.
1837320	1841640	I mean, it's just like, he does this farting one and I'm like, I don't, is
1841840	1846040	someone crinkling a Gatorade bottle?
1846040	1847840	Like it doesn't sound like fart.
1847840	1855640	And then it's like, I don't, see, it's just a mudslide train in a windstorm.
1855640	1860240	His soundboard is nine muffled crowds and three shitty farts.
1860240	1862240	That's it's just, it's confusing.
1862240	1867640	You want sound effects to answer questions and then every, every 20
1867640	1870640	presses, he has to watch an ad for a match three game.
1874640	1876040	Some of those are good.
1876040	1884240	Yeah, it just, well, anyways, men, men only have prostates.
1884240	1891440	Women don't and men have, therefore they have a grape in their butt that if you're
1891440	1895240	rub it the right way, there's a whole thing and that's it.
1895240	1897040	I'm content leaving this topic.
1897040	1898440	Wait a minute.
1898440	1904640	What's that procedure that you, when you, um, a colonic, you know, the colonic?
1904640	1906840	That's a colonic, an animal.
1906840	1912440	Sundays used to be colonic day for me and I would get colonics.
1912440	1912640	All right.
1912640	1913440	Take it from there.
1913440	1920240	And, uh, it was at first, I was trepidatious of it.
1920640	1928640	I was kind of not, I was worried about it cause I heard stories about what they do
1928640	1936240	there, but when I got there and then they took care of me, it was actually in
1936240	1937840	hindsight was pretty good.
1937840	1938440	Hindsight.
1938440	1939440	It was all right.
1940440	1944340	In hindsight, you felt, you felt, you felt cleaned out.
1944740	1945140	Yes.
1945140	1945940	I felt great.
1945940	1955040	People said, my eyes, my eyes were brighter by the people at the facility or no, no,
1955040	1957240	no, people at work were like going, you look good.
1957240	1957840	What are you doing?
1957840	1961040	I said, oh, I got all the shit sucked out of the hotel.
1961140	1961440	Yeah.
1961440	1961840	Yeah.
1961840	1969640	I wait, except one time, um, she said, she said, okay, whatever you do, you know,
1969940	1975240	you know, maybe two days before you come in here, eat, eat something that's, you
1975240	1976540	know, I'm like vegetables or something.
1976540	1977040	Whatever.
1977040	1978040	It's something hot.
1978140	1978940	Yeah, whatever.
1978940	1979440	Yeah.
1979940	1981340	Give me some, give me a challenge.
1981340	1986340	And for some reason, I forgot that I had an appointment set up and I spent like all
1986340	1988640	day eating french fries, chips.
1988640	1990440	Oh, so she always says, don't eat bread.
1991140	1995740	She said, she said, eat stuff, but don't eat, don't eat so much work hard.
1995740	2000340	Don't, don't, don't, don't point a snow blower at the shovel.
2000340	2002740	You're at the, at the sidewalk.
2002740	2003640	You're hiring me to shovel.
2003740	2008140	So anyway, halfway through, there's a problem.
2009940	2010340	I know.
2011840	2016840	And it's, I'm getting some blockage, which is, which is hard.
2016840	2018440	No, I mean, it's a turd.
2018540	2020040	It's, it's something.
2020440	2024840	And anyway, I'm like going, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
2024940	2026640	And she's being very cool about it.
2026640	2028140	You know, she's trying to make conversation.
2028140	2029140	She's like, just breathe.
2029140	2030040	You're going to be okay.
2030040	2030540	It's okay.
2030740	2033940	So what are you and your wife going to, you're going to do anything
2033940	2034540	this weekend?
2034540	2035540	How's your dog doing?
2035540	2037040	And I'm like, she's okay.
2037040	2043740	I'm just, and I'm like tapping my leg and I'm going, I don't know.
2043740	2045040	I don't know, man.
2045040	2046740	She's like, just, just breathe.
2046740	2047840	You're doing fine.
2048040	2048440	Okay.
2048440	2049440	You're linking a little.
2049440	2050440	You're leaking a lot.
2050440	2051640	She's telling you that.
2051940	2054640	Do you need to, do you need to go?
2054640	2057840	Do you need to, do you need to, do you need to go?
2057840	2060440	And I was like, uh, see if you can breathe through it.
2060440	2061140	You don't have that.
2061140	2063040	I'm like, I can't, I can't.
2063040	2063340	Okay.
2063340	2063740	Okay.
2063740	2064140	Okay.
2064140	2064440	Okay.
2064440	2066540	I'm going to pull it out.
2066640	2067040	All right.
2067040	2067640	Okay.
2067840	2068740	So, okay.
2069140	2070640	Can you, can I pause?
2070640	2070840	Sure.
2070840	2071340	Sure.
2072840	2079340	A lot of people listening want to know what position you're in.
2079340	2080640	Oh, I'm laying on my back.
2080840	2082040	Laying on your back.
2082040	2082640	Laying on my back.
2082640	2083240	No, no, no.
2083240	2087540	Laying on my side and there's a tube coming down from my side.
2087540	2088740	She puts the tube up my butt.
2088740	2090840	And there's a tube coming down from like an IV line.
2090840	2093040	It's like a, it's a car, but what do you call it?
2093040	2096240	Yeah, there's a machine with a little window so you can see all the
2096240	2099440	shit you ate like throughout the week going by going.
2099440	2100040	Whoa.
2100040	2101840	Oh, when it comes out of different hoes.
2108540	2111340	I mean, what do you mean comes out of different hoes?
2111340	2112040	There's only one home.
2112040	2114740	You just said you saw stuff going by and also she's concerned about
2114740	2115140	leaking.
2115140	2116740	Like, isn't the whole point to leak?
2116840	2118640	Like, well, it's about.
2118940	2125240	It's supposed to like shoot water up your butt and then for a while
2125240	2129040	and then you it breaks down everything and then I guess she turns
2129040	2130540	it up and it sucks it out.
2130540	2131940	Oh, oh, okay.
2132440	2132740	Okay.
2132740	2137140	I didn't know that so it's it's so so to eat a bunch of french fries
2137340	2142340	is to create a kind of dam of of half french fry half.
2143340	2144040	It's painful.
2144040	2146240	Yeah, and also it's like it's palpable.
2146240	2147840	That's like, oh, this isn't going all the way up.
2147840	2149840	It's supposed to go the water is supposed to go all the way up.
2149840	2152140	They're like, that's supposed to be a gopher in this hole.
2152140	2155440	Yeah, yeah, we've come to an impasse.
2155440	2155840	Okay.
2155840	2159140	All right, and she's and she's saying to you when she says, are
2159140	2160040	you going to be okay?
2160040	2162040	Do you want to meet a stop?
2162040	2166540	She means do you want to go take a shit or she's saying should I
2166540	2167440	run for cover?
2167440	2170440	Should I should I get away?
2170440	2181440	I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I can't do it.
2181440	2182440	I can't hold it.
2182440	2183340	I can't hold it in.
2183340	2185040	I say to her, are you saying to her?
2185040	2186340	There's only one person in the room.
2186340	2187540	No, but I thought in her monologue.
2187540	2192740	I didn't know in her monologue in her monologue in her monologue.
2192740	2198440	I thought you said in her like she did stand up while I was during
2198440	2199240	her monologue.
2199240	2200040	You're talking?
2200040	2200940	No, I'm sorry.
2200940	2201240	Okay.
2201240	2203340	You're I just wanted to you're saying out loud.
2203340	2204340	You're going nurse.
2204340	2206140	I I'm having a prop.
2206140	2210140	I can't I said you do you need to go and go I think I need to go.
2210140	2210840	She's like, okay.
2210840	2211740	Well, okay.
2211740	2212440	Give me a second.
2212440	2213140	Oh boy.
2213140	2214140	You're really leaking.
2214140	2214440	Okay.
2214440	2215140	Here we go.
2215140	2220740	And I'm going to count to three one two three and pull it out.
2220740	2226040	And you get it rock from the table to the toilet that's across the
2226040	2233040	room and just shit all over her shit on her the floor the the
2233040	2233540	every.
2233540	2240140	How I and then while I'm sitting and she says you need some time
2240140	2240440	alone.
2240440	2243340	I said, yeah, I think I think I need some time alone.
2243340	2248540	I don't I don't understand why she's not more like like why her
2248540	2250840	industry isn't more prepared for this.
2250840	2252240	That's what I don't know.
2252240	2253940	She told me not to eat french fries.
2254240	2256940	It's a that's too much her job.
2256940	2262640	I screwed up and and she has had a wonderful attitude about it because I
2262640	2265340	was like she's like I mean, she says you're leaking.
2265340	2268340	It sounds like you have a dysfunction about you.
2268340	2271840	Not oh, you've been using your body the way a body should be used.
2271840	2272340	You're leaking.
2272340	2276840	There's a turd halfway down the water is hitting the turd early.
2276840	2280340	She could just she couldn't she just tie it off with this.
2280340	2283440	All this water that's already up in my intestine right now.
2283440	2286040	I mean, she could turn it off, but there's still so she when she
2286040	2289440	checked in with you and said, hey, something's happening.
2289440	2294040	You can we get on the same page here and like if you had said no,
2294040	2294740	it's cool.
2295540	2296840	It's fine to get going.
2296840	2297840	She would have been like, okay.
2297840	2299740	I'll just increase the pressure of the hose.
2299740	2299940	Yeah.
2299940	2300140	Yeah.
2300140	2304140	I mean like what what it would happen with on your average day.
2304140	2306040	There would be moments of oh boy.
2306040	2308440	That's a that's a that's a that's a part.
2308540	2309840	That's a part there.
2310040	2310840	That's an area.
2310840	2313340	That's a that's something we have to deal with and then I'd be
2313340	2316840	like and then she would get out jazz.
2316840	2318940	Oh like like there's a clump of grass in there.
2318940	2319940	Yeah, okay.
2319940	2323940	This is going to be and then we could go through and then it
2323940	2327140	would and it just this is the thing is like they're getting
2327140	2331640	out all the gunk and crap and shit and that's what I'm confused
2331640	2334840	by is how they regard that as force majeure when it happens.
2334840	2336440	This is a turd of this ass.
2336840	2339540	That's the part that's like the United going ladies and gentlemen
2339540	2339840	again.
2339840	2341040	We do have a full flight.
2341040	2342340	I don't know how it happened.
2342340	2343740	I'm not know how it happened.
2343740	2344640	You double-booked.
2344640	2347340	You work in the airline or gas industry.
2347340	2349240	This is not oh, no, I'm sorry.
2349240	2350440	I'm on your side.
2350440	2352140	Okay, this is about consumer awareness.
2352140	2356040	My ass is supposed to suck that out cleanly and efficiently.
2356040	2359740	What's supposed to suck the tube that's in my yeah, so is it
2359740	2363040	sucking or is it shooting you it's doing both it's shooting
2363040	2366240	water up and then sucking it out, you know, because she turns
2366240	2367840	up water for a while and then she goes okay.
2367840	2369940	I'm gonna do some suction around and you go.
2369940	2371340	Oh, what is that onions?
2371840	2372940	Okay onions.
2376140	2379140	And then you and then and then but then there's some times
2379140	2384340	where it's too much where I'm like a good good good good
2384340	2387240	where it's like, oh man, you know when you're trying to hold
2387240	2388640	in like poop and stuff?
2388640	2389040	Okay.
2389040	2394240	So when she says it's leaking she means I you're sitting all
2394240	2395240	over my hands.
2395240	2397940	She means my arm my blouse.
2397940	2400840	She means you are not being a conduit.
2400840	2402740	You're a broken circuit.
2402740	2407140	She's regretting some life choices saying like she's saying
2407140	2411840	like there's there's a lot because I know I hate to acroid
2411840	2415040	you about this, but the so the thing going up your ass is a
2415040	2416040	two.
2416540	2419840	It's got two tubes ongoing and I don't know the I think
2419840	2421040	it's a two-way thing.
2421740	2422940	Like an electrical cable.
2422940	2424540	It's gonna take us away.
2424540	2427640	Yeah, like it's he's completing a circuit like it's the
2427640	2428640	whole thing.
2428840	2430740	I think I got I feel right about this.
2430740	2431240	I don't know.
2431240	2435140	I'm not exactly sure and I'm sure I'm sure there's plenty
2435140	2439040	of people that are listening to the show that will kindly
2439040	2439940	correct me.
2440940	2443540	But I don't think anybody's still listening to this show.
2450540	2451840	The best people in America.
2451840	2452940	He pulls it out.
2453640	2457740	She pulls it out and it's just like, you know, pop in a water
2457740	2459940	balloon and I'm just like, yeah.
2461040	2469040	And I'm and I'm doing this shit all over my hand the floor.
2469240	2472440	It looks like it and then I and then she goes I'm gonna give
2472440	2473440	you some time alone.
2473440	2477040	Yeah, I think you should she leaves the time alone and then
2477040	2483240	she turns on like like the the ambient music a little louder.
2483240	2489040	She can switch other than oh, what a feeling dancing on the
2489040	2489540	scene.
2490140	2494740	Yeah, the music goes up full value and I and of course,
2494740	2498240	I'm I'm finishing on the toilet and after I've washed my
2498240	2498540	hands.
2498540	2501940	The first thing I do is of course, I have to text Agee and
2501940	2506540	go I just shit all over the this poor woman and he's writing
2506540	2506740	back.
2506740	2507440	Oh my God.
2507440	2508240	What are you talking about?
2508240	2513840	I was like, well, I got this this colonic and I ran it.
2513840	2519740	I ate poorly two days before and it gave me some issues and
2519740	2521740	I shit all over this woman.
2521740	2524340	Yeah, I mean, that's the part I'm trying to it's not that
2524340	2526340	I don't have anything not figured out yet.
2526340	2528640	I'm just sort of trying to wrap my brain around the colonic
2528640	2530640	industry where they go come inside.
2530640	2532940	We're going to wash the inside of your butt out.
2533240	2536840	We're going to warm water up one side.
2536840	2539240	We're going to suck everything that comes out the other side.
2539240	2540540	No, it's the same tube.
2540940	2542240	It keeps water up.
2542840	2544640	It's the same to make it reverse.
2544640	2547840	Okay, they're moving for that.
2547840	2550740	She's got a so she's she's in charge.
2550740	2552240	Okay, this is starting to make sense.
2552240	2555540	I think she's like Mark Twain like like like she's got a
2555540	2558840	mechanism where she's like forward after like it's like
2558840	2561640	there's there's there's soapy water going that way and then
2561640	2564640	she's like, okay, how you feeling and you're like peachy
2564640	2568140	and she goes cool wrong and then she's supposed to see a
2568140	2572340	certain amount of coming back and then what she sees is,
2572340	2575740	you know, a half a pineapple and she's like, did you have
2575740	2579040	a heavy breakfast and you're like, no, you told me not to
2579040	2580740	and she's like suit yourself.
2580740	2582140	This thing's a lie detector.
2583540	2586340	She shoots it up forward and then you're like, okay,
2586340	2588940	that's not but and she brings it backward and there's like
2588940	2592240	a wedding ring and a wristwatch and she's like look you
2592240	2593240	had brunch.
2593440	2594640	Yeah, say you had brunch.
2594640	2599240	I had brunch and she's like go to the bathroom shit out your
2599240	2603040	shit stuff before I clean your asshole rim.
2603040	2605840	Yeah, and you're like, okay, and she threads it out and
2605840	2611040	then diarrhea explodes everywhere all over the world and
2611040	2614440	she's like it and she goes and she's like, it's okay.
2615240	2617540	It's fine and she kills herself.
2617540	2618440	I never see her again.
2618440	2622240	No, I just she didn't say she wasn't like it's okay.
2622240	2622740	It's okay.
2622740	2623640	It's normal.
2623640	2624940	She wanted to impress upon you.
2624940	2626840	She's been doing this for a long time.
2626840	2628640	I'm sure I'm not the first time.
2628640	2632140	I'm sure today was not the first time she saw somebody else's
2632140	2636240	shit if you ate a as of the Steven Wright bit like if you
2636240	2639840	ate a box of Oreos before going to the dentist the dentist
2639840	2643740	would they'd be like look, what did you come on?
2643840	2646240	You want to meet me halfway and you'd be like, what do you
2646240	2648340	mean? You're supposed to clean my teeth to be like you ate
2648340	2649440	a box of Oreos.
2649440	2650740	I want to get my money's worth.
2650740	2653140	Yeah, clean it with just you're the expert.
2656440	2657940	Yeah, they change the tube.
2658940	2660340	Everybody gets the same tube.
2660340	2663640	Leave me leave me asked from the audience.
2663640	2666040	Did they do they change the tube?
2666040	2667340	Did they change the tube?
2667640	2671940	Yeah, even I'm for those of you listening.
2671940	2675040	That's diarrhea sound number, right?
2675540	2676740	Yeah, that was all that was in my mind.
2676740	2682340	It's like on the another another episode, but she's she
2682340	2686340	made it a point to say I don't there's the the nozzle tip.
2686340	2690140	There's like an adult size and then there's a child size.
2690140	2694940	I like to use the adult or the child size on adults because
2694940	2696940	it's not as evasive.
2696940	2701640	It's not as very so it's the size of a small dick.
2701640	2709040	Why do we think that men in America associate the butthole
2709040	2713040	and things going up it like why is that a normal amount of
2713040	2719140	American but like women too are like like is it a is it an
2719140	2726340	American butthole thing or is it a male American gay thing?
2726640	2728640	I think it's an American male gay thing.
2728640	2732540	I think the worst thing you could ever be in America for
2732540	2736240	most Americans believe this is is to be a gay man.
2736240	2741140	And we're told early on that gay men use the butthole that
2741140	2743840	that's the joke that you're told and they're like, yeah,
2743840	2745840	they don't have vaginas so they use the butthole.
2746140	2749340	Yeah, I mean like that's that's that's the beginning of being
2749340	2751040	othered as a kid.
2751040	2754140	You know, you're you're you're gay man and everybody goes
2754840	2757840	We're also like genuinely ashamed of jerking off like like
2757840	2760040	kids that you talk to they're like there's like different
2760040	2760740	mythologies.
2760740	2761140	Really?
2761140	2762240	Are kids still?
2762540	2763640	I don't know if they still are.
2763640	2767240	A guy in high school had to move towns and I had to change
2767240	2771440	schools and like actually the family left town because
2771440	2774240	somebody caught him like walked up and looked through the
2774240	2778240	window of his house and he was there masturbating and his
2778240	2779940	nickname became Jackhammer.
2779940	2780240	Yeah.
2780240	2782540	I remember you telling me about that and and he was so
2782540	2783640	ashamed and humiliated.
2783640	2786940	He left the goddamn town and that's for you kids listening
2786940	2787440	and my kids.
2787440	2789240	I mean 30 and below.
2789240	2793640	Here's here's how you sort that if you're a high school
2793640	2797440	masturbator, which if you're in high school, you're masturbating
2798340	2799940	don't let people catch you.
2799940	2802840	Just like make them like just be in the bay window of your
2802840	2805440	house and just be jerking off if I can like dare them to
2805440	2806340	come up in your lawn.
2806340	2807140	Yeah, it's a different.
2807140	2808540	It's a different steeple chase now.
2808540	2811640	But the crazy thing is that that kid because there was
2811640	2814940	no internet yet that kid could look in your drapes see you
2814940	2817640	jerking off and then convincingly tell the locker room.
2817740	2820140	He was jerking off and then you'd have to change schools.
2820740	2821240	This is it.
2821240	2822740	This isn't about changing times.
2822740	2827340	This is about our attitude about sex and self exploration
2827340	2827740	and things.
2827740	2830540	This is like how bad it's always been and hasn't really
2830540	2834140	changed even though nowadays a kid could look in your drapes
2834340	2835440	and see you jerking off.
2835440	2839740	But the difference is if he didn't have his camera, it'd be
2839740	2842540	your word against his and it wouldn't matter.
2842540	2845640	It's really about the cringe value of how you look when you
2845640	2848340	jerk off now because now the kids know everyone jerks off,
2848340	2852140	but how about how vulnerable you are, which is the same thing.
2852140	2852840	You know what I mean?
2853040	2853940	Another factor on that though.
2853940	2855740	Also is that like the parents are different.
2855740	2858540	I mean the things that you're talking about now we're around
2858540	2862440	at a time where now those there are kids in that age age group
2862440	2865340	who now are adults and have children and they probably
2865340	2866540	socialize them differently.
2867040	2869340	And sometimes I bet you're fucking the kid up by trying to
2869340	2871740	be responsible like who wants your dad sitting on the foot
2871740	2875440	of your bed talking about your dick like it could be it
2875440	2877740	could be the 40% of the time when you think you're doing
2877740	2880740	it right whose dad it is Chris Pratt's dad.
2880840	2881940	Okay, oh man.
2883040	2884140	Yeah, obviously fucked up.
2884140	2885040	Let me look at the guy.
2885040	2887740	No, I'm just saying like you don't know you could have the
2887740	2888640	best of intentions.
2888640	2892740	You could have yet we don't because we don't have we we
2892740	2895640	know everything about bee stings that you should know
2895640	2898540	by now until we invent a way to treat bee stings better.
2898540	2901940	We have we don't know anything about kids going through
2901940	2905240	puberty and like like starting to feel how they feel and
2905240	2905740	blah blah blah.
2905740	2910040	We put it off and it's not even just I'm going to say even
2910040	2911340	though we feel like in America.
2911340	2912240	We're hung up about it.
2912240	2913940	Like it's the species, right?
2913940	2915740	It's like the whole fucking species.
2916240	2919340	We don't just go like oh by the way, there's a thing in your
2919340	2921040	butt and there's a thing in your balls.
2921040	2923540	I'm like no one wants to talk to kids about this shit.
2923540	2926240	Like when do you can't when do you talk to would like you
2926240	2929240	could be like you're seven years old before you care about
2929240	2932440	it. Let's talk about your butt and your balls and your dick
2932440	2934640	and your nipples like the kids like what are you talking
2934640	2934740	about?
2934740	2937440	Talk about Spiderman, but then a year later that kid could
2937440	2940340	be like I'm going to I'm going to go fucking insane because
2940340	2942340	no one understands what I'm going through because my nipples
2942340	2945640	feel weird fucking what a lost species.
2947640	2949640	Do women shame each other about masturbation?
2950340	2951840	Is that a girl thing Church?
2952840	2956840	Like you know, yeah, I've never heard a story of women walking
2956840	2959540	in on another girl masturbating in high school and that being
2959540	2960340	a giant bummer.
2960340	2961740	This is just a guy thing.
2964440	2965140	Yeah, they learned.
2965140	2967740	I mean I hear a lot of stories about girls like more they
2967740	2970540	practice kissing and stuff whatever but I'm not I'm not
2970540	2973140	going to I'm not going to spokesman that but I do feel
2973140	2976740	like but I've also heard stories about like dudes talking
2976740	2979640	about jerking off and then one kid in the in the group of
2979640	2981040	friends will be like, yeah, jerk off.
2981040	2984040	It's the best and then that'll just be the story of how that
2984040	2987140	kid changed that community.
2987140	2989640	Yeah, like like they're like, oh, but you're cool.
2989640	2991740	And he's like, yeah, and I fucking jerk it off all the time.
2991740	2994840	And so do all of you by and everyone's like he's right.
2995740	2997140	Like I've heard those stories.
2997140	3001240	It's kind of like if word got out in my high school that

3028540	3029040	tortured.

3030240	3032240	Yeah, why don't you yeah, I've heard a couple of those
3032240	3033040	stories.

3063940	3065440	brought something to eat.
3065840	3068140	What would you have brought if you had planned ahead?
3068240	3075240	She'll we all know the answer to that question now as a
3075240	3077440	vegan now, how do you get your nachos?
3077640	3079140	You do the vegan nachos.
3079140	3082440	I do vegan nachos, but I don't do I don't I do vegan
3082440	3083140	cheese.
3084340	3085540	It's it's not the same.
3085540	3086840	You can choose is kind of a drag.
3087440	3088440	This is getting better.
3088440	3089240	It's getting better.
3089240	3092240	Yeah, I mean it everything is getting better like beyond
3092240	3095240	burgers and are fantastic.
3095240	3098740	I you know, I just I don't melt vegan cheese.
3098740	3105540	It just doesn't taste is good and but but it's I still
3105540	3106640	and I still love it.
3106640	3110440	I still eat that shit eat that shit fucking stupid.
3110740	3113140	I went and had a chat with Kevin Smith who is basically
3113340	3116740	vegan now because he just had his first heart attack.
3116740	3118140	I don't want to knock on wood.
3118140	3120740	Oh, yeah, I'm not scheduling more heart attacks for
3120940	3124840	almost like like yeah, yeah, yeah, he had like a huge like
3124840	3127640	total like he we didn't we didn't talk about that that
3127640	3129640	much because I figured he's been talking about that forever
3129640	3133840	on his podcast, but it was really but he's only he's two
3133840	3138340	years older than me and he so he was never a heavy drinker.
3138640	3143240	But now he's like he's just gonna go vegan and it has
3143240	3145540	nothing to do with him caring about animals.
3145540	3150240	He's just like I'm gonna they told me I have to it's like
3150240	3153540	all this meat and stuff and then he's like, yeah, then
3153540	3156940	my friends are like, oh, what are you now now that you had
3156940	3160040	a heart attack, you're gonna be like this kind of person
3160040	3163740	and he's like, no, I'm just ate meat for 47 years.
3164140	3165140	It was a good run.
3165140	3168240	I'm gonna like now I'm gonna go vegan because of this thing
3168240	3172040	happened. Well, this is oh, so you almost died because you
3172040	3173140	weren't doing something.
3173140	3174840	So all of a sudden you're gonna start doing it.
3174840	3175740	Yeah, what are you a pussy?
3175740	3178740	You were thrown 80 feet from a car wreck and you're gonna
3178740	3180740	start wearing your seatbelt all of a sudden.
3181640	3182840	It's like a really weird.
3182840	3185240	I mean, I don't people love to put people down.
3185240	3187240	So it's not also I'm sure there's not a single person
3187240	3189240	we could pull up that they're like, yeah, that was me.
3189240	3191940	I was Kevin Smith's friend that really tried to shame him.
3192340	3195240	I'm sure he was just quite a collectively that would be
3195240	3197740	true. Kevin Smith still has all these friends that just bully
3197740	3200740	him. That would be like amazing.
3201340	3202640	I wonder what that's like.
3203540	3204840	That guy's a big Rob Strom fan.
3204840	3208140	I'll tell you that fucking talk to talk to Kevin Smith about
3208140	3208640	Rob Strom.
3208640	3209940	I like him most of the time.
3209940	3212540	He's been very nice to me.
3212640	3214440	Did you talk about robot bastard?
3215740	3216240	No.
3216340	3216840	Okay.
3218740	3220040	I was like, can we move on?
3220840	3223740	You know, and he's like, what's it like working with Shrub?
3224340	3226040	I'm like, I don't know.
3226240	3227340	Like, I don't know.
3227640	3228140	Dumb.
3229340	3230640	And he's like, no, come on.
3230640	3231840	It can't be that dumb.
3231840	3233840	I'm like, it's not dumb. Prove it.
3233940	3234840	And he's like, prove what?
3234840	3235940	I'm like, fuck you.
3235940	3238040	Shrub, what do you want to do with Kevin Smith?
3238840	3242340	Sounds like you could collaborate with him instead of Dan.
3247940	3249140	That's on the table.
3249140	3251240	That's so weak and lazy.
3251240	3251940	It's a low.
3252140	3256640	Now, I every time I see Kevin, he's very very nice.
3256840	3260740	He's actually a big reason why I did the last four issues of
3260740	3262740	skied because somebody sent me.
3262740	3266640	Oh, Kevin's talking to you on the forum.
3266640	3267540	Remember forums?
3267840	3270740	He's talking to you about you on the forum and he just wrote
3270740	3275440	like, hey, you know, I love sked and Shrub never wants to finish
3275440	3276440	the book.
3276440	3278440	It's okay.
3278840	3280740	I just, you know, I just respect him.
3280740	3283540	I think he's good and whatever.
3283640	3285140	I got the whole shebang right here.
3285540	3286640	Is it buy that somewhere?
3286640	3287840	Is this a new release, Shrub?
3288040	3292640	It's a new edition of the whole shebang which came out in
3292640	3296540	2008. This is the fourth reprint of it and it's got a new
3296540	3297040	cover.
3297140	3299240	It's got the whole it's hefty.
3299240	3302040	It's like the like the LED or the yeah, it's like over 800
3302040	3302640	pages.
3303140	3307340	I'm hoping I can do a Kickstarter this year for the 25th
3307340	3309140	anniversary to maybe do.
3309140	3309940	I don't know.
3310540	3313440	I'm going to regret saying this but a color version of the
3313440	3314040	whole book.
3314040	3316840	I think I'm not talking shit about comic books.
3316840	3318140	I just never got into them.
3318140	3320440	But I think Skuds are the only comic books.
3320440	3321940	I've read like cover to cover.
3321940	3323040	Oh, thank you.
3323040	3325240	Not I mean because I know you because you gave them to me
3325240	3327340	but you know, they're so well drawn.
3327440	3328240	They're so good.
3329540	3330140	Thanks.
3330840	3331740	How do you do it?
3331940	3333440	I don't anymore.
3333440	3336140	I don't do anything one issue a month.
3336440	3341340	Like we would all hang out and we'd smoke weed and drink and
3341640	3342640	do whatever we were doing.
3342640	3344840	But then ever unlike now every once in a while, Shrub would
3344840	3347840	be like, I'm gonna go work.
3348340	3349740	Like what are you working on?
3349840	3353040	Well, you know, I'm working on a thing like he didn't want
3353040	3356240	to like open it up to us and like talk it out and invite
3356240	3358240	like all of that maelstrom.
3358240	3363440	So he was like for at least a month, probably several months
3363440	3365040	because you probably weren't doing it maybe like a month
3365040	3368040	that I have for like going home and like Bob Cratchit like
3368040	3370040	fingerless gloves under your kitchen table.
3370040	3372540	You're like drawn a page of a comic book that you and you
3372540	3375140	weren't it wasn't like running around telling everybody
3375140	3377440	I'm gonna do a comic book and it's gonna be about this and
3377440	3379340	that never said anything about it.
3379340	3385640	Just would go home every night and work on it and then one
3385640	3390040	day unveiled that he while the rest of us have been not
3390040	3394840	understanding our prostates that he had made this comic
3394840	3396040	book on his kitchen table.
3397140	3398140	Very interesting.
3398140	3399740	Yep, interesting behavior.
3400340	3401840	Yeah delayed gratification.
3401840	3402540	They call it I guess.
3402540	3402940	Yeah.
3405240	3406340	Yeah, I got it.
3406340	3407440	Yeah, yeah.
3409340	3412340	So what would it be like if Kevin Smith had friends that
3412340	3414040	were like making fun of all the time?
3414740	3415440	I don't know.
3416240	3420640	I thought you were asking was I let's check in with Spencer.
3420940	3421340	Okay.
3421340	3422340	Thank you.
3422340	3423640	What do you think you would be like?
3424340	3426540	I think it'd be a little something like this.
3427340	3428240	Hey, stop.
3428240	3429640	Stop leaving me alone.
3429640	3434640	I already gave you a copy of tusk like that.

3585640	3587240	Yeah, I'm just making fun of it.
3589140	3591740	Kevin Smith was a fan of the mama rap.
3593040	3594440	We sent him the album.
3594440	3597040	It's a pretty cold rhyme, but your mama plays burger time eating
3597040	3598640	up the pickles with a little squeeze of lime.
3598640	3599840	Yeah, I'm a craftsman.
3599840	3603440	I don't it doesn't I don't think pickles would need lime.
3604640	3608640	So what's the your mama gets none when she's playing out run.

3618640	3621340	I can name maybe three Supreme Court justices.
3621340	3623040	I know all the words to the mama rap.
3625740	3627240	The mama rap dead ale wise.
3627240	3629240	If you don't know it, is it trackable?
3629240	3629940	Can you find that?
3629940	3631740	Oh, yeah, I'm sure it's on YouTube.
3631740	3632540	I hope it's everywhere.
3635840	3637240	Did we talk last week?
3637240	3639440	Did we talk about Nunberg?
3639440	3641640	And this isn't the political thing.

3660940	3663640	at scare at the scare much at the mooch.
3664340	3669540	But this guy fucking out mooched the mooch by just being a complete fucking
3669540	3670340	it was kind of fun.
3670340	3673540	Like as the very definition of a rodeo clown like Eric Burnett is
3673540	3675440	like you smell like booze.
3678040	3681740	He just came drunk to tell Robert Mueller to go fuck himself on
3681740	3685840	every every platform.
3686040	3689340	It's such a great like Martin Short used to do that Nathan Therm guy.
3689340	3690640	It's like whatever you asked.
3690640	3693440	I mean just like no, I didn't know I didn't I had the
3693440	3694440	side affidavit.
3694440	3697140	I never said that's stupid.
3697140	3697840	It's ridiculous.
3697840	3698940	It's stupid.
3698940	3700340	Don't you think it's stupid?
3700340	3702040	I think it's stupid change working.
3705940	3706940	Oh my god.
3707640	3710340	Yeah, but that was I mean, it's a different character because
3710340	3717540	the thing about Nunberg is he's like the he's like the Cupid version
3717540	3719140	of that like what do you call a cherub?
3719240	3723240	He's a cherubic version of Martin Shorts Nathan Therm.
3723640	3726440	So there's the sweat has it looks gathered as Libya.
3726440	3730640	He's just like he's just like a flying baby who just flitted through
3730640	3734940	and he just had a little quiver and is just like I think you should
3734940	3735440	be in love.
3735440	3737540	I think I should be love Roger Stone's my father.
3737540	3740640	He's like a father figure to me and he just like he didn't know of
3740640	3743640	anything that didn't taste like marshmallows and what was the
3743640	3744440	end result with him.
3744440	3750940	I he I did I we see he testified for he said I'm not going to go
3750940	3752540	in and somebody said you're going to go to jail.
3752540	3753840	I'm not going to go to jail.
3753840	3754640	Oh, yeah.
3754640	3756140	It's just rule of law.
3756340	3759440	And so he went in and and then he came out and he was like, you
3759440	3760040	know what?
3760040	3761240	It's not that bad.
3761240	3764040	Like the guy think was the I think that's how it ended.
3765040	3766340	I think he's like, yeah, it's all right.
3766340	3766940	That's fine.
3767740	3771340	You just need a little extra, you know, a little baby little baby
3771340	3772340	goes in for a haircut.
3772340	3774940	You need to like give him a dinosaur to chew on you know, he
3774940	3776440	just need a little extra from us.
3776440	3781840	I think he got drunk and then he was like, I'm going to be famous.
3781940	3786640	I'm going to be like that girl who caught cash meat outside.
3786640	3789340	This is going to be great or like the lady wouldn't make the
3789340	3793340	cake for the gays or whatever, but like he I think he bought
3793340	3798540	into the like I think I think he got swallowed up in the weird
3798540	3801640	gel that they used to douse the hillbillies.
3801640	3804440	Like they're like he started getting high on that supply and
3804440	3807040	being like, well, wait, this this subpoena is bullshit.
3807540	3810240	Hillary didn't do a subpoena and meanwhile the everybody's
3810240	3813840	going like, yeah, well, we all like yeah, it's one thing to
3815240	3817640	you can't do what you're doing and then you're like watching

3894540	3896740	I never watched an episode of Mary Hartman.
3896740	3897640	Mary Hartman.
3897640	3898740	Am I missing out?

3904340	3907640	Is anybody I mean seriously be serious.
3907640	3912040	Has anyone on the stage watched an episode of Mary Hartman?
3912040	3913140	Mary Hartman.
3913940	3916540	I saw all of them when I was okay.
3916540	3917640	Stand corrected.
3917640	3919240	Tell me the premise of the story.
3919240	3921140	She gets bit by a radioactive.
3921140	3922840	What I was a kid.
3923540	3924040	I don't know.
3924040	3930440	She just seemed out of touch and it was a very and sort of
3930440	3933140	unhappy but trying to put a happy face on stuff and they
3933140	3934640	shot it like a soap opera.
3934640	3936440	Yeah, it was on every day.
3936440	3939540	It was it was offered to the same buffet as the soap opera.
3939540	3941140	So you were getting guiding light.
3941140	3943640	I remember the rest was very late night thing.
3944140	3946640	No, New York was maybe syndication or something.
3946640	3948040	It was 1130 at night.
3948040	3948340	Yeah.
3948340	3950640	Well, no, well, they couldn't put it on before.
3950640	3951640	It had to go on at midnight.
3951640	3953940	It was probably like a Muppet show like where they sold it
3953940	3954640	syndicated.
3954640	3957340	Right, but I was I was always told it was like oh, that's
3957340	3958340	kind of risque.
3958640	3959840	It's kind of risque or whatever.
3959840	3960540	What's the deal?
3960540	3962540	She's just trying to get by.
3962540	3966040	It's because people that that consider themselves above a
3966040	3968140	soap opera wrote a soap opera.
3968340	3970440	So it was meta, right?
3970440	3974440	It was like I'm a soap opera meet moop like oh, you're a
3974440	3976040	piece of shit for watching me.
3976040	3977540	Wasn't Fernwood tonight?
3977540	3978740	Wasn't Fernwood tonight?
3978740	3983040	Yeah, spin off of that and in in the show, she doesn't hear
3983040	3983540	well.
3985340	3988240	I don't know you're saying that's why it's called Mary
3988240	3990440	Hartman Mary Hartman because you have to say everything
3990440	3991040	twice.
3991540	3992240	Yeah.
3995740	3996040	All right.

4108240	4110240	Oh, yeah, it felt like no pun intended.
4110240	4111840	You were sitting on one one time.
4113440	4115740	I had a funnel and some golf balls.
4117140	4118540	That's most of the story.
4119640	4120240	No.
4123240	4125640	No, I don't have a singular butt stuff story.
4125640	4126940	What about like an average one?
4126940	4127840	What about a plural one?
4127940	4129740	Average butt stuff story.
4130340	4131640	Taking a shower.
4132940	4134440	Put some stuff in your butt.
4136440	4137640	Some fingers.
4138540	4142340	You know, he's not taking this seriously at all.
4143440	4144440	This is serious.
4144540	4145740	No, it was worth a shot.
4146440	4149640	We've told the story on the show before about you flying too
4149640	4151240	close to the sun with your bathtub, right?
4151340	4154640	Yeah, I put my butt up against the nozzle of my bathtub.
4155540	4158140	You have like a jacuzzi like spa like a water jet.
4158140	4161840	How would you what's the melted wax wings of flying too close
4161840	4162540	to the sun?
4162640	4164640	You get air bubbles in your bloodstream.
4164640	4169440	You get you get flooded with water.

4170940	4171440	Yeah.
4171740	4175040	Yeah, I just immediately had this sensation.
4175040	4176540	It was a reverse pooping.
4177140	4179040	Were your eyes brighter after?
4180740	4184940	You texted me immediately and said I you said Jeff I took a
4184940	4187440	bubble bath and I because you've been you have been reporting
4187440	4190140	to me daily about how you found out that you could jerk off
4190140	4194140	in your bathtub by kneeling down in front of the side nozzle
4194640	4198140	and putting jacuzzi water up your butt while you jerked off.
4198140	4200440	Like it's the best and then you text me one day.
4200440	4204340	It's a Jeff I flew too close to the sun and I inflated myself
4204340	4205340	like a water balloon.
4207240	4212040	Yeah, and I get to get out of the now empty bathtub and run
4212040	4214040	over to the toilet and sat down with it and then just like
4214040	4217940	this sound it sounded like you just bought a bucket from
4217940	4218640	Home Depot.
4218640	4222340	I just pour it just sounded like that, but I was like wow.
4222340	4223840	I was like I gave myself an enema.
4223840	4225240	Yeah, I've told that story.
4225240	4225440	Yes.
4225440	4226740	I have told that story.

4237840	4239340	Jeff you tell me a story.
4239340	4241240	What is this true?
4241240	4242640	Is it know what I mean?
4244740	4248440	Jeff told me a story once long ago that he says one time I
4248440	4255640	shit so bad that I passed out and I hit my head on the sink
4255640	4257440	and there was cut my head open.
4257440	4258340	Is this true?
4258340	4261840	Well, yeah, and every whatever it looked like somebody murdered
4261840	4266540	somebody after it was a day after Christmas boxing day.
4266540	4270540	Yeah, red-nosed a boo boo and I was at my grandma's house
4270540	4273640	and I'd eaten a lot of Christmas, you know, turkey before
4273640	4274340	I was vegetarian.
4274340	4280340	So yeah, I was probably 22 ish and 22 shit.
4280340	4284440	I remember waking up pant like panting.
4288340	4290940	And I was like it was cold where I was laying and I open my
4290940	4297640	eyes and all I see is floor wall and door and I look up and
4297640	4301240	there's blood everywhere like all over the mirror the sink
4301240	4305840	the thing and I apparently had either peed or food and I was
4305840	4309940	sitting down got up fainted and smashed my face into the
4309940	4313240	edge of the sink and then flew to the other side of the bathroom
4313240	4316140	and landed there and only woke up at my grandma said Jeff
4316140	4317140	the phone is for you.
4317540	4321040	Can I look up and I like I still have a scar across my nose
4321040	4323340	and it's one of the two reasons my nose goes a little bit
4323340	4323840	that way.
4324840	4326240	But yeah, fuck myself up.
4326640	4328540	How do you know it wasn't aliens?
4328540	4329340	What's this?
4330240	4332440	Is the second reason your nose always goes that way?
4332440	4334840	Cuz I fucker punch gator.
4336340	4337740	I punched me at a Nick Cave.
4337740	4339440	Oh, that's the wow.
4339440	4341340	That's the reason why it goes a little bit more the same.
4341340	4342140	Oh, yeah.
4342640	4346840	That was recent but I this is controversial.
4346840	4349240	Remember I talked about that the woman Alice Flaherty the
4349240	4352340	great neurologist who kind of read you like an MRI.
4352340	4354840	Oh, she walked by me and I was saying I was telling like
4354840	4355940	this other actress in this product.
4355940	4360140	We're doing based on this neurologist from Harvard like
4360140	4363640	life and I said I was telling the story about I passed out
4363640	4366640	and I broke my nose and she walked by and she goes what
4366640	4368540	what you passed out when when how old are you?
4369640	4371140	I said I was 22 and she goes.
4372740	4373840	Had you just peed?
4374640	4375840	I said, yeah, and she goes.
4376740	4377840	Good and she walked away.
4379240	4380540	I knew you were a Pisces.
4383540	4385240	You know, I fucked myself up man.
4385240	4388740	I broke like I had a cut across my ear my cheek my nose and
4388740	4390740	the other cheek like I went just wham.
4391240	4395240	So you went into the bathroom closed the door locked it.
4395240	4400740	Hopefully shit so hard that you passed out and cut your face
4400740	4402340	open stood up too quickly.
4402440	4404840	I faint from time to time like my dad faints.
4404840	4406340	My brother faints were tall were skinny.
4406540	4410040	We get up and we if we've just eaten a lot or whatever if
4410040	4411140	we stand up too quickly.
4411140	4413140	My dad never fainted at channel 101.
4413340	4414640	Oh, that's right.
4414640	4416340	This came and I was all worried.
4416340	4417240	My dad had a heart attack.
4417740	4420140	The paramedics came like you know, you were sitting in a
4420140	4420640	load chair.
4420640	4421840	Do you normally stay up this late?
4421840	4422140	No.
4422140	4423140	Did you just eat a lot?
4423140	4424740	Yeah, and did you stand up quickly?
4424740	4424840	He goes.
4424840	4425640	Yeah, you're fine.
4425840	4426940	Look at the fuck out of here.
4427640	4432040	Like I think from time to time if I like if I'm on low blood
4432040	4433340	sugar and stand up too quickly.
4434140	4440940	So everybody else in the Thanksgiving family setting goes
4440940	4441240	out.
4441240	4441640	Goodbye.
4441640	4443040	He said I'm gonna go take a shit.
4443040	4443440	Okay.
4443440	4443940	Goodbye.
4443940	4448440	And then you leave and then like phone rings knock on the
4448440	4449040	door.
4449240	4450640	Hey the phone's for you.
4450640	4456040	You come in come out covered in blood and they went huh.
4457740	4458840	It was just me and my grandma.
4458840	4461940	I'd gone from the it could only be one person.
4462340	4464340	Reacting to say Jeff your phones for you.
4464340	4467040	I'm like and that's when I woke up and I see blood everywhere.
4467040	4470140	I go like tell them I'll call find out who it is.
4470140	4474340	I'll call him back and I looked up and my face is just covered
4474340	4474740	in blood.
4474740	4476640	Why would that be just splattered?
4476640	4478040	It was a complete crime scene.
4479440	4480840	Were you still bleeding?
4480840	4483540	I mean, oh, yeah, it's still pouring blood out of my cuts.
4483540	4487740	So did you like go to the hospital to get stitches?
4487740	4490540	I probably should have I think I either glued it.
4491540	4494640	Like probably glue to cut, you know, like a skateboarder trick.
4494640	4496540	The hockey trick.
4496540	4499340	Yeah, it's a Vietnam trick.
4499840	4501940	But then I like I walked around like I got one of those little
4501940	4506340	small like Bugs Bunny Band-aids little ones that you put the
4506340	4507340	boxers got in a fight.
4507340	4508740	Yeah, like Bugs Bunny.
4508740	4510940	Yeah, and I had that across my nose.
4510940	4514240	I mean, I've never been a tough looking guy, but if you walk
4514240	4518840	in to a bar even at 22 is like when I would weigh like 170
4518840	4523440	pounds with the one across your nose and a big Shiner people
4523440	4526640	think like people wouldn't even make eye contact with me.
4526640	4530440	I think I looked tougher because like like Bugs Bunny.
4531940	4534740	Looks like I'd be like well, he's vulnerable when I got it
4534740	4535740	when I was in high school.
4535740	4539340	I was me and my friends used to like sword fight with PVC pipes
4539340	4543440	and one time we had a tremendous Perry that blew up both of
4543440	4547940	our pipes and one of the sharp shards of PVC sliced into my
4547940	4553340	face and caused this like vertical scar going from my eye
4553340	4557440	like down my cheek and like like you see in cartoons and stuff
4557440	4561040	it had those little cross cut things along it for whatever
4561040	4564040	reason and so like when I went to school people are like
4564040	4565040	that's crazy.
4565040	4567440	How'd you get and I was like, oh I was in a fight and then
4567440	4569340	people thought I was a total bad-ass.
4569840	4570940	Did you get stitches for that?
4570940	4573940	No, no, that was so weird because I assume it was stitches
4573940	4576740	but it's like it just like naturally formed that in the
4576740	4577240	scar.
4577240	4579540	They got those little butterfly band-aids that are great
4579540	4581740	like it like I've cut myself pretty bad and there's ones
4581740	4584440	that you like stretch them out and they pulls it back together.
4584440	4587240	It's almost like a stitch little butterfly ones.
4587240	4587940	They're little mini ones.
4587940	4589740	Yeah, one of those have like extra.
4589740	4590940	I don't care about those.
4591840	4594740	Well, I have nothing else to talk about you hate stories
4594740	4595740	about cut fingers.
4595940	4598540	No, well, I can't sure but you guys weren't telling those.
4598540	4599040	That's fine.
4599040	4600540	I was about you guys are doing great.

4607440	4608640	it's not drinking fun.
4608840	4610940	A lot of fun drinking coffee out of a mug.

4627140	4627840	Where do you get it?

4628240	4633640	You get it at my tea public store go to tea public and use
4633640	4636940	a honey add-on to try and find a coupon code for it.
4636940	4640540	I saw that a guy commented on your one of your things and
4640540	4643840	he said will there be any cheapy peepy t-shirts and you
4643840	4644940	replied to him?
4645540	4647940	Why would I make fake merch you piece of shit?
4648840	4652740	Like yeah, why would I?
4653840	4655940	What you're trying to say to that kid is you're not cheapy
4655940	4657740	peepy and you don't know what he's talking about.
4657740	4661740	We know that I'm not so why why would this be a surprise
4661740	4663040	to you and why would you?
4663840	4665540	Why wouldn't I react?
4665840	4667240	Why would it be fake merch?
4667240	4671540	I don't know if the kids I'm not that word.
4671540	4673540	Why does that make the merch fake?
4674540	4679040	I am not that word, but the merch is real regardless of
4679040	4681540	what you call the merch you want.
4681540	4683140	I'm not that word.
4683140	4685240	Are you enjoying the iPad Pro?
4686240	4689940	See I'm going through a bad time.
4689940	4693540	I want to I want to draw but I can't do I can't
4693540	4694740	force myself.
4695740	4698440	So the iPad Pro isn't something you're using right now.
4698440	4702340	I'm trying like it or I just kind of lay around and do
4702340	4702540	nothing.
4702540	4703840	Do you still have Dan?
4703840	4705440	You still have Dan's iPad Pro?
4705440	4705840	Are you?
4706240	4707240	Yeah, I'll give it back.
4707240	4710540	I guess I mean, I'll give it back.
4710540	4713340	Well, you know, if you're still testing it out.
4714140	4718440	Yeah, it kind of I mean, I'll give it back.
4718640	4726040	I just did this whole drama this whole like dragging me
4726040	4731340	through the the fucking mud and making the shame every time
4731340	4732740	I open it and look at it.
4732740	4739040	I just hear you probably feel bad about myself.
4739040	4741440	I don't know how to even I can't even look you in the eye.
4741440	4742140	Well, okay.
4742140	4745140	Well, so now you've talked about dragging people into the
4745140	4749940	mud. So now you're like what you're implying to me that I
4749940	4752040	have inhibited your creative throughput.
4752040	4752640	No, no, no.
4752640	4756540	I was I was I was I was there long before Dan's the reason
4756540	4757140	of shops.
4757140	4763240	You didn't help it to but he didn't you aren't responsible.
4763740	4766540	So you don't like you don't like the iPad Pro.
4766640	4769840	I don't like he doesn't like the person who gave a hard
4769840	4771540	time with everything right now.
4771540	4773540	I don't like my laptop.
4773540	4778240	I don't like my my Apple TV.
4778240	4780640	I don't like you know, whatever.
4780640	4785040	I'm having I'm just I'm I don't I don't I could talk more
4785040	4791340	about this off mic, but I'm not I'm not it's not helpful.
4791340	4792240	I'll give it back.
4792240	4792640	You're good.
4792640	4793340	I know.
4793340	4794640	I'll give it back now.
4795140	4801140	Why would I why would I why would I make like a TV PB anything?
4801140	4802440	I'm not saying you would make it.
4802440	4804840	I'm saying it wouldn't be fake merch.
4804840	4805740	Yes, it would.
4805740	4809040	No, it would be you would have made a real piece of merch
4809040	4810640	that says the worst TV.
4810640	4812740	Here's the thing that's wrong about that sentence.
4813040	4814640	I wouldn't have done that.
4815140	4819340	So don't say you it would have been fake because I didn't do
4819340	4819840	it.
4822140	4827240	And the hypothetical situation where you did this you right.
4827340	4831040	I'm not going to what if like just this is totally theoretical
4831040	4831840	hypothetical.
4832040	4836140	What if like you if I like came like from like like a Twilight
4836140	4841040	Zone like like figure from outer space and said, Schwab,
4841040	4844840	if you make cheap EP merchandise, you'll become like you
4844840	4846040	will get 10 million dollars.
4846040	4851540	You don't want 10 million dollars saying something that is
4851540	4858040	absolutely hurtful, wrong, false, shitty.
4858040	4862940	Why would I want to celebrate him making fun of me?
4863240	4866840	Why would I want to put a spotlight on that?
4867440	4873240	Why would I want to why would I want to so but not for 10
4873240	4874040	million dollars.
4874040	4874940	You wouldn't do it.
4874940	4877940	You wouldn't consider that a value hooker, dude.
4877940	4881640	I'm not going to just hold on your principles man.
4881940	4883440	Hold on to your principles.
4883840	4886140	Hold on to my principles.
4886640	4887440	All right.
4888040	4894640	That makes sense.
4894640	4897740	Why would I could make 10 million dollars?
4897740	4900640	All I have to do is not have any self-esteem.
4902840	4904840	Sounds like a good trade-off.
4904840	4907340	I'm the one that's got to look at me in the mirror in the
4907340	4909340	morning every morning.
4909640	4913140	I got to live with me the rest of my life might as well cash
4913140	4915640	in on shit.
4915640	4917040	30 million dollars.
4917040	4919040	No, a hundred.
4919040	4920240	What am I going to spend 30 million?
4920240	4922240	You could use a hundred million dollars to make other
4922240	4923340	people less cheap.
4923740	4926440	You could create institutions where you could teach kids to
4926440	4929640	have your kind of cheap money.
4930240	4931740	I'm not cheap.
4931940	4933240	Anyway, it's not cheap.
4933240	4933640	All right.
4933640	4934340	Whoa.
4935540	4938640	How's your fucking free coffee mug ass dick?
4946140	4947440	Ass dick.
4954740	4956840	There's going to be a set of mugs.
4959440	4962340	That should be a t-shirt as how's your free coffee mug
4962340	4963140	ass dick.
4968140	4969640	Yeah, it's funny if it's not on a mug.
4971940	4973640	It's a better bumper sticker or t-shirt.
4973640	4974040	Yeah.
4974740	4976540	That's not how coffee mugs used to be.
4976540	4979040	You know, coffee mugs used to have to have like a more
4979040	4984740	banal amount of like invective to them like a week before
4984740	4985640	the weekend.
4985640	4988940	But what you're really thinking is fuck this job, but
4988940	4990340	like ranking dads.
4993040	4997740	Well, yeah, I've never seen the number two dad.
4998340	5002840	No world's second best second best father.
5003640	5004940	Those mugs get hidden.
5006140	5007240	They're in the back.
5007740	5011240	They get pushed to the back behind the generic because they
5011240	5014340	go think about you ever go through a phase where you're
5014340	5016240	like you love your grandma, right?
5016640	5019540	And then like and then like you look back on and go like
5019540	5022540	oh, yeah, like there's kind of planets lined up and I was
5022540	5024740	kind of like I wrote a letter to my grandma.
5025340	5026940	I was like you're a super grandma.
5026940	5030140	Yeah, and then like the next year it was like and all the
5030140	5030840	previous years.
5030840	5033840	So it was like Grandma must have been like, oh cool.
5033840	5035240	This moment has arrived now.
5035240	5036540	These grandkids are paying off.
5036540	5039240	Let's put this on the fridge better leave some space for
5039240	5039840	the next year.
5040040	5043840	I think it's like fuck this is a hard super Grandma.
5043840	5045340	What the fuck am I talking about?
5045440	5046740	I don't even know who was what?
5046740	5047440	How do I even know?
5047440	5048440	I got one Grandma.
5048840	5051040	I try to call I know she's the shittiest one.
5051340	5055040	I try to call her like every other week or something.
5055140	5057440	You try to call your Grandma every other week.
5057440	5058640	Yeah, Jesus.
5059140	5063640	Or she'll like call me like she'll call me like at 1130 at
5063640	5065740	night and just she wants to talk.
5065740	5067640	I feel like nobody ever you're high roading me.
5067640	5069340	You don't give a fuck about your grandma.
5069340	5070140	Yeah, I do.

5096140	5096440	week.
5096940	5098640	Dan instantly just cross his arm.
5098640	5101140	No, it's to cross his arms.

5102540	5106640	He goes you weren't but he said he said have you ever done
5106640	5106940	that?

5127640	5128440	do anything for me.

5129840	5132040	I got all sets of Grandparents.
5132040	5133440	Our relationships are great.
5133440	5136640	They all call me regularly and I don't have to maintain the
5136640	5137540	relationships.
5137540	5138640	It's just so easy.
5138640	5140540	You're doing exactly what they give me.
5140740	5144440	That I appreciate and not true off color.
5144440	5148440	I've never had a meal by them that tasted stale and disgusting.
5148940	5151840	Are you guys jumping into a Grandma loving to barge?

5198040	5199140	Oh, yeah.
5199440	5203340	I was I was giving an account of something that would be
5203340	5205940	impossible by most understandings.
5205940	5209540	He was algorithmically mocking your relationships with your
5209540	5210340	grandmothers.

5218140	5219040	That must be real hard.
5219040	5222540	You must have to have one of your calls to talk about it.
5222540	5223740	You're fucking low-roading us.
5223740	5226140	Yeah, it's fucking yeah.
5226140	5229540	Why don't you go take advantage of your normal social or
5229540	5230440	safety network?
5230440	5231040	It's great.
5231040	5231440	Yeah.
5232640	5233140	Thank you.
5233140	5235740	Fucking Jesus Christ Jesus fucking normies.
5236240	5238640	There's nothing safe about loving someone.
5238640	5240040	My grandpa's dead.
5240540	5241240	It's great.
5241940	5243640	Minds are too.
5243840	5244740	It's great, right?
5244740	5247340	When you're a kid remember you're in sixth grade fourth
5247340	5249940	grade, whatever you're in all of a sudden all the other guys
5250040	5251940	they're all talking about showers.
5251940	5253340	No, they love showering.
5253440	5254340	Oh God.
5254340	5255240	I can't believe it.
5255340	5257840	Can't get enough water showering dude.
5257840	5259240	I take three showers a day.
5259240	5260540	I take 90 showers a day.
5260540	5261540	Like what is happening?
5261540	5262540	How does this happen overnight?
5262540	5263640	We used to like being dirty.
5263640	5266340	What did what did you guys what happened here?
5266340	5269240	Why is this the new metric for how to be normal?
5269540	5271440	I can't believe how many showers I take.
5271740	5275940	I didn't get what look obviously if it's an unconscious mechanism,
5275940	5279540	if you just love showering then fine.
5279540	5283640	If you love your parents if you if you have emotional like
5283640	5289440	connections with people and then good for you but we're like
5289440	5292640	figuring we finally figured out we're taking showers and then
5292640	5295540	all of a sudden it's relations with your grandparents that
5295540	5296540	everyone's talking about.
5296540	5299640	Yeah, it's like we're just figuring out soap and conditioner
5299640	5302640	and now it's grandparents but Dan you have just in time for
5302640	5306040	the grandparents to die by the way, but then you also I mean
5306240	5309140	one mitigating factor is that you had a grandma that may have
5309140	5310040	murdered two people.
5310040	5311140	That was my great-grandma.
5311140	5312640	That was my grandma's mom.
5312740	5316040	If anything, you know, like well bring her around doesn't
5316040	5316440	matter.
5316440	5319140	It's not there's no grandmas that are to blame victim of murder
5319140	5322340	or was I just here's only in hell.
5322340	5324340	Here's what all family is now.

5638240	5642440	What is it is if I said thinking about it like that of
5642440	5646040	ideas it yeah, because guess what instead of ideas is if
5646040	5650640	you if you if your language is practical, you could just go
5651140	5654840	when you like something that when you jump in.
5654840	5656440	Yeah, it's that you're going to need.

5691840	5693340	What do you draw like an Apple?
5693440	5698940	So if I said did you ever have any suicidal ideas or thoughts?
5700040	5701540	You wouldn't know what I was done.
5701540	5702340	That would be good.
5702840	5703940	That would be like
5706940	5715140	No, I don't know what you're talking about.
5715640	5720940	No, I see how much time you saved by saying it your way.
5720940	5726240	Yeah, we've got the answer from what Spencer said.
5726240	5732440	Oh, no, we don't because we've been talking about this.
5733340	5734240	Word.
5734240	5737640	There's a million ways to say everything and I
5738840	5743540	Yeah, but the way that you said was bad if you have suicidal
5743540	5746040	ideas, you would have known what I meant and we could have
5746040	5748540	moved on say anything any way you want.
5748540	5749240	Thank you.
5749340	5750940	Thank you for permission.
5750940	5752340	Wait, thanks.
5752540	5756440	Thanks for permitting me every time we choose a way to say
5756440	5756940	a word.
5756940	5759640	We should stop down and explore alternate ways.
5759640	5761840	We could have said that phrase or sentence.
5761940	5764740	It's also like a tag like a kid could type in suicidal
5764740	5766940	ideation instead of suicidal ideas.
5767040	5769440	If they type in suicidal ideas, they might get half of them
5769440	5771540	on the schematic for how to kill yourself.
5771640	5772740	I think they've been ideation.
5772740	5774740	Maybe it takes them to more crisis lines.
5774740	5778140	We don't it's like it's like a river.
5778640	5782640	I'm going to go home and I'm going to type both in this
5782640	5786540	because huge for you and I'm going to I'm going to be blown
5786540	5788240	away by the difference.
5788740	5795340	I'm going to be just event one big being blown away by the
5795340	5796340	difference.
5798040	5800940	Look, I don't I don't want to care about people anymore either.
5801340	5802340	I have a shit story.

5812540	5813840	thing that's ever happened to me.
5815340	5816940	I was I was 14.
5816940	5818040	I was in eighth grade.
5818440	5822840	So middle school not quite high school yet and my grandparents
5822840	5824040	they lived on Long Island.
5824840	5828340	We had like we were visiting we had like Chinese food or
5828340	5832940	something and we lived in New Jersey and it was about hour
5832940	5834440	and change to get back home.
5835940	5839740	And we had a Chrysler Town and Country minivan.
5839740	5844240	Okay, it's a two four seven seven-seater.
5844240	5846640	So you have the two seat fronts of the seat, you know, driver
5846640	5850740	passenger and then two seats behind those seats and then a
5850740	5851940	bench in the back.
5852440	5857040	I need I need you guys to understand like a three-person
5857040	5859440	every good shit story needs it that you have to understand the
5859440	5860440	full geography.
5860940	5863940	If this car drops you have a Demurgis Charter plane.
5863940	5867340	Wait, I just want you guys to understand you guys get you guys.
5868840	5873740	So so my dad's certain and you was an option.
5873740	5874940	We didn't have the wood paneling.
5875740	5876640	My dad was driving.
5876640	5878240	My mom was in the passenger seat.
5878440	5880640	My brother who was two years younger than me.
5880640	5885640	So he was 12 was sitting behind my mom was in the passenger
5885640	5885840	seat.
5885840	5887640	My sister is in her car seat.
5887640	5889340	So she's nine years younger than me.
5889340	5894940	So she's like five and then I'm behind my brother in the in the back
5894940	5898340	seat and the three the three-person on the row big big family.
5898940	5900740	Yeah in the very back of the minivan.
5900740	5902940	You're 14 years old 14.
5903540	5909840	Like if you if this story culminates in you diarrhea in a fan and we are
5909840	5912840	supposed to be laughing because we realize your sister got hit first.
5913540	5914540	We have a right to go.
5914540	5916940	We didn't retain the birds eyes.
5916940	5917540	That's fine.
5917540	5917940	That's fine.
5917940	5922140	Okay, but just so you understand like I'm in the very back and my
5922140	5924640	siblings are in the middle of my parents or whatever you get a big
5924640	5925140	family.
5925140	5926740	Yeah, whatever.
5927740	5932040	It's it's it's very it's visceral for me because it's like this is it's
5932040	5932740	haunted me.
5933940	5939840	So we're driving back to New Jersey from Long Island and my stomach
5939840	5940540	starts hurting.
5940540	5943540	I'm like, oh, no, this is this could be potentially bad.
5943540	5945240	I think I could maybe wait it out.
5945240	5949440	But there's so much traffic on the cross Bronx and it's like real not
5949440	5953440	great areas driving through and I'm starting to go like hey, like can
5953440	5955840	we stop can we stop my mom?
5956440	5956940	I'm sorry.
5958340	5959940	Like Northern Jersey, Morris County.
5962840	5965440	From from more at least eat the mic.
5965440	5968740	If you're going to work, just do we're just New York thoroughfare
5968740	5969640	bullying him.
5970340	5973240	He's like you took the you took the Bronx from the tunnel of the
5973240	5973740	Lincoln.
5973940	5977840	You know, it's like a sad it's like a sad holding that far to more
5978240	5978940	but I was a kid.
5978940	5982540	I didn't I mean, I felt like I could I could I know I just felt like
5982540	5984740	I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom soon.
5985540	5987940	Know that that's a long way after four.
5988640	5989740	What nothing?
5989740	5991940	Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
5991940	5996840	Okay, so so we're driving and I'm like, okay, I'm like, I think I
5996840	5998340	might have to go to the bathroom.
5998440	5999740	Can we stop somewhere soon?
5999740	6002740	And we're and my dad and my mom are going look we're stuck in
6002740	6005440	traffic and this is not a gray area to stop anywhere.
6005940	6006440	It's late.
6006440	6007440	It's late at night already.
6007440	6008640	We don't know what's going to be open.
6008640	6009640	Just try to hold it.
6009640	6010440	You'll be fine.
6010840	6011940	I was like, okay, I'm holding it.
6011940	6012740	I'm holding it.
6012840	6015840	We keep going getting closer to like the George Washington Bridge
6015840	6019740	which takes you from New York to New Jersey and now your siblings
6019740	6020740	there tuned in.
6020740	6021740	Are they merciful?
6021740	6022640	Are they going there?
6022740	6024640	They are leaving or they like hey, buddy.
6024740	6027840	No, no, I mean, I'm not yet complaining to the point where it's
6027840	6028340	a problem.
6028340	6030640	I'm just going cleared your throat at this point.
6030640	6033940	Yeah, I'm voicing what's happening a little bit.
6033940	6035440	Just like hey, just a heads up.
6035440	6037940	Well, there was a conversation though where they said could
6037940	6039640	you hold it and they knew it wasn't number one.
6039640	6040640	They knew it was number two.
6041640	6043840	Yeah, I was like, look, I really got to go.
6043940	6046640	So then your son that your siblings aren't like this.
6046940	6048340	Yeah, yeah, hit in the car.
6048340	6050240	Yeah, I'm not proud.
6050340	6050740	I'm not.
6050740	6052240	I mean, it didn't hit that point.
6052240	6054340	It didn't hit like maybe it's a loving family.
6054340	6055540	Maybe it's a loving family.
6055540	6057540	So so we're going.
6057540	6059740	We're getting closer to the bridge and then it starts to
6059740	6062740	really hit me and I'm like sweating and and I'm like, okay,
6062740	6065840	this is I we have to stop.
6065840	6069040	We have to stop somewhere and we're stuck in traffic.
6069540	6072440	And I am and we're about to hit and we're about to hit the
6072440	6075040	George Washington Bridge is like there's nowhere to stop
6075040	6078540	and George Washington famously that I do feel this is important.
6078540	6079740	I don't want to sort in you.
6079740	6082040	Yeah, George Washington cannot tell a lie.
6083440	6084240	Yeah, continue.
6084440	6087440	Any cross of some water across the Delta.
6087440	6090440	So I'm I'm like, I'm not going to make it.
6090440	6091440	I'm not going to make it.
6092240	6094840	And my my mom's like here everything's gonna be okay.
6094840	6095440	You're okay.
6095440	6096140	Don't worry.
6096140	6096840	I'm so sorry.
6096840	6097640	It's going to be okay.
6097640	6099240	My dad's like you got to make it.
6099240	6102140	You got to make it give us like 10 15 minutes.
6102240	6105140	Wait is your mom is there is your mom saying if you shit
6105140	6107940	your pants, it's cool and your dad's like you can make it
6107940	6110440	or is there are they no no no like they're just trying
6110440	6111840	to be saying hold the line.
6112140	6114640	Yeah, my dad's like you got it.
6114640	6118040	Like we're almost over the bridge and we could stop.
6118140	6120140	Are you rocking back and forth?
6120140	6126340	Yeah, I'm like you could feel it just like ready to burst
6126340	6129740	like and and my stomach is killing me and I'm rocking
6129740	6133740	and I'm sweating and I'm buckled my seat belt.
6133740	6134540	There's no crown.
6134540	6136640	It's just and I'm like, I'm not going to make it.
6136640	6141440	My mom gives me she goes she's like here's a plastic bag.
6141440	6145740	Just in case you need to and I was like what and it's like
6145740	6148440	this. It's like a sandwich smaller.
6148440	6151240	It's like a medium-sized like Marshall's bag.
6151240	6154040	You know that like the clothing.
6154040	6155940	Like it's a plastic and shirts and stuff.
6156040	6157340	Yeah, it's got the plastic handle.
6157340	6158740	Well, that's kind of actually okay.
6158840	6161740	So I'm better than like a ziplock option.
6161740	6167140	Yeah, so I'm like, oh no, like I can't theoretically and
6167140	6171140	then so I was so then I put the plastic bag under me
6171240	6172040	and it was dark.
6172040	6172740	It's night out.
6172740	6174540	So I can't see people teasing you at this point.
6174540	6178040	Are they all like fucking makes it because this is going to
6178040	6178940	be a nightmare.
6178940	6181440	No one wants to everyone's on your team now.
6181540	6184940	Yeah, your brother wasn't laughing his ass.
6184940	6186240	No, he was like Jesus.
6186240	6188140	This is so embarrassing for him.
6188140	6188740	Oh my God.
6188740	6191640	What I'm looking for is there's an older brother earlier
6191640	6194340	who's like, ha ha you have to shit.
6194340	6196840	No, I know that brother's like, come on, buddy.
6196840	6197740	You can do it.
6197740	6198640	I'm the older brother.
6198640	6201340	And so I'm like, I'm so sorry.
6201340	6202340	I'm so sorry.
6202540	6204740	I can't hold it and everyone's like, no, no, no.
6204740	6207740	And and then it's just like, oh my God, I pull my pants down
6207740	6213340	and I'm like, like and then it's just and I was 14.
6213340	6214640	I was way too old.
6214640	6216140	This is like six months ago.
6216140	6220240	Yeah, and this is three months from me moving to me and my
6220240	6222640	mom the entire time is going it's okay.
6222640	6223440	It's okay.
6223640	6227840	My brother, my brother, I start shitting and it's the worst
6227840	6231840	diarrhea noises ever in your fucking life and I'm dead just
6231840	6232440	turns up.
6233640	6236440	She seems to have but invisible touch.
6236940	6241240	She takes control and sell it as you and my mom's just going
6241240	6241640	it's okay.
6241640	6242340	I'm so sorry.
6242340	6243940	I feel like this is the worst.
6244340	6244840	I'm sorry.
6244840	6247240	We couldn't stop and like and it's just like just diarrhea
6247240	6250240	flowing out of me and the worst noises and I just remember
6250240	6251640	my brother going, oh my God.
6251640	6252240	Oh my God.
6252240	6256040	My sister going, ew, it smells fucking five years old.
6256040	6257940	Yeah, open a window.
6259940	6261640	Well, of course open a window.
6261640	6262840	Your sister's right.
6262840	6268140	Yeah, like who thought seal seal us in but it's like freezing
6268140	6268940	winter time.
6268940	6270540	It's like no one cares George.
6270540	6273740	Why if George Washington, yeah, okay had been watching.
6273740	6275640	He'd be like open all the windows.
6275640	6277140	I mean this happens.
6277140	6280740	I felt like an eternity and then finally the pain, but then
6280740	6284240	it's like what you can't sit down back on that seat.
6284240	6287940	Also like wipe with there's no napkins.
6287940	6288440	I don't know.
6288440	6290040	Maybe she gave me some issues.
6290040	6294340	Full of diarrhea up and I but it was it was explosive.
6294340	6297740	I have no idea like yeah, what happened and there's no spots
6297740	6301940	on the bridge to just pull over like even just your trap
6301940	6304340	your trap and I'm just hovering over and we finally get over
6304340	6306940	the George Washington Bridge and my dad gets off and he like
6306940	6310640	makes a right and we get it to this KFC to assess the damage
6310640	6316940	and we turn on the lights and it's just it's just I maybe
6316940	6324040	got like if I was lucky 60% in the bag and not only that
6324040	6331240	but it was like it was all over my boxers and everything.
6331240	6334640	I just remember my dad taking the bag out of the car with
6334640	6338740	my boxers and just throwing in a dumpster behind KFC and
6338740	6340540	we just drove home silently.
6340540	6343540	I only just wanted to be at the Nordstrom's that the bag
6343540	6349740	came from Marshalls and we get home and my mom is just like
6349740	6352840	I'm so like I'm so sorry that happened and she like she's
6352840	6354840	like why don't you go upstairs and just like clean off and
6354840	6358340	like go lie in bed and she cleaned the backseat of the car
6358340	6364040	because I miss them so much of the bag and it was traumatizing
6364040	6368040	and my family will never forget that it happened but they all
6368040	6372740	laugh at it. You don't have any older siblings.
6372740	6375940	You're the oldest so Jordan's Jordan's two years younger than
6375940	6381240	me. Wow and my sister's nine years younger than me and that's
6381240	6385040	it's just the three but so yeah, so now everybody remembers
6385040	6387440	it now. It's funny like it's not like it causes you pain to
6387440	6390440	remember it right except to the transport back. You're like
6390440	6393640	that's own that story. It was it was embarrassing at the time.
6393640	6396540	It's like, you know, you're trying to like I can't believe
6396540	6399240	the little brother wasn't fucking dying. No, he was just
6399240	6402540	like if Jeff Schwab was taking a shit in the backseat, I would
6402540	6407240	have been dying laughing. Yeah, but not when you smell it
6407240	6410340	though, but that's that's the his little sister. She's like
6410340	6413640	it stinks. She's like I get it now. There's consequences.
6417140	6420040	And then someone's like rolled out a window. Yeah, you think
6420040	6425640	yeah, your family sucks. Just kidding. I love my grandparents.
6425640	6428340	I call them once a week. I talked to my mom. All right.
6428340	6431740	All right ass face, but also my dad. You know, what else are
6431740	6437240	you shitting bags? Why didn't couldn't they just stop dead
6437240	6440840	in the in the on the bridge? No, the tunnels. There's nowhere
6440840	6445940	to stop. No, you stop. But but then throw the bag of diarrhea
6445940	6449440	out under the bridge. Yeah, he's so that's awful. Like Henry
6449440	6454740	Portrait of a serial killer. You stop on the bridge and then
6454740	6458840	you get out and then you shit outside of your upholstered
6458840	6463540	car. With all the cars with this card. What are they gonna
6463540	6466740	do? Dude, I don't think it's legal for me to diarrhea on
6466740	6470540	the George Washington Bridge. I don't think the cars going
6470540	6473040	10 miles an hour. It's not. It's not. It's you're imagining
6473040	6479640	it's probably going to freeze. Well, they're not at all stopped.
6479640	6481640	It's a big long bridge in there. Imagine I'm going like the
6481640	6484440	speed of it, but I feel like there's stops and starts.
6484440	6486640	You know with traffic and it just seems like if you're stopping
6486640	6489240	at all, then then you just stop and be like it's going to
6489240	6493040	take a minute instead of 10 seconds. Hey, I think if there
6493040	6496840	are any other option than him shitting in a bag in the back
6496840	6499040	seat. I think they would have taken that out. I don't think
6499040	6501840	they took us seriously and that's why the situation unfolded
6501840	6505440	the way it did. I think there are options on the table that
6505440	6507940	were not fully explored. The options were to pull off in
6507940	6513840	the Bronx and like try to find a nice stop. Well that you
6513840	6517140	should have done once you're on the bridge. You tried to
6517140	6519840	make it onto the bridge. You've got our sympathies once you're
6519840	6522740	on the bridge, right? Don't tell us you weren't willing to
6522740	6526240	take a shit in the Bronx or you become the I was willing
6526240	6528540	but but it was late. It was like 10 o'clock at night.
6528540	6530740	So where do you where do you they don't know and it's like
6530740	6532640	well then the answers anywhere could not pull over in the
6532640	6537840	Bronx because judgment night was still in. Dennis Larry
6537840	6541440	would still come for you on your ass. I but no, I mean,
6541540	6544940	I'm just saying as much as it might be the case like a bridge
6544940	6548640	everyone's like I get it the bridge. Spencer is fascinating
6548640	6550740	me because he's picturing the bridge in a very nuanced way.
6550740	6552840	He's like look it's a thing about cars. The thing about a
6552840	6556540	car in front of you is it's an impassable obstacle. You can't
6556540	6559640	drive through a car because it's not obeying traffic laws.
6559640	6563640	You just you simply have to stop. So if they had to shit
6563640	6566440	that bad so that you stopped your car in the middle of
6566440	6570040	traffic, the cars behind you would stop. You know, I would
6570140	6574840	instantly cause a car at any age 14 years old till now would
6574840	6577140	rather shit in the car with my family than get out and shit
6577140	6579240	in front of a punch in New York. I also still think you're
6579240	6583940	bit. I think you're picturing bumper to bumper or like
6583940	6588240	stop and start traffic. It's like there's a there's a medium
6588240	6590640	split there where it's like look it's like a conveyor belt.
6590640	6594940	You're not going to let your kid go out. It's like you just
6594940	6599840	said on the edge of the bridge and get a newspaper and
6599840	6604540	just kind of find a way to because I wasn't that confident.
6604540	6607540	That's my fourth line item. You're saying this is a town
6607540	6611040	and country minivan right sliding door. Couldn't you just
6611040	6616740	hang it up like you're painting the line and see if we were
6616740	6619340	your family. This would be like you'd shot in the first
6619340	6624440	bit. If your family have been Spencer's you would have they
6624440	6627740	would have like said look we're going to stop the car. The
6627740	6631240	kid goes out takes a shit in the snow on the side of the
6631240	6634240	George Washington Bridge and people who honk like the
6634240	6636940	Spencer in the front like goes back and goes like look the
6636940	6640740	kid is having diarrhea. Would you rather him have it in my
6640740	6644640	car and then they keep honking and the dad goes keep honking.
6644640	6647140	It won't make his diarrhea right exactly. This is exactly
6647140	6649940	what I expect to be happening and everyone's fine and then
6649940	6652340	the kid the good the upside of that is that the kid gets
6652340	6655840	back in the car and he's like my dad fucking loves me. I
6655840	6661340	mean either way I was going to diarrhea. It's just how
6661340	6664240	much how much are we going to put out everybody else?
6664240	6667640	No, you know, do we take on that burden ourselves or share
6667640	6671240	with the rest of the New York Spencer? Surely you understand
6671240	6674340	like people are shitting everywhere already. No, the New
6674340	6678240	York has a it's got a schedule. New York you got you got
6678240	6681240	the uptown. You got the Midtown. No, but that's the thing
6681240	6683640	he gets out and then people are like honk honk and he's
6683640	6687440	like I'm shitting over here, right? Well, that's I'm
6687440	6691140	shitting here, but you guys are you guys are referring to
6691140	6696440	a man who didn't stop. He said I'm walking here. That means
6696440	6699940	I'm getting out of your way here. I'm almost through. You
6699940	6702440	can't say I'm shitting here. That means I'm staying here.
6703040	6705640	If Dustin Hoffman's line in Midnight Cowboy had been I'm
6705640	6709040	what I'm standing here that that movie would have ended
6709040	6712740	20 minutes into into it would have been better. Well,
6712740	6715340	yeah, I've never seen it, but I understand it to be pretty
6715340	6719440	boring. It's just two guys like running around doing drugs
6719440	6722940	and sleeping with people. Apparently, that was
6722940	6725340	improvised that the car that pulls up was not supposed to
6725340	6728040	be in the shot. Oh, and he actually riffs that line. Oh,
6728040	6731640	wow. Well, that makes it good. He was walking there. He
6731640	6733640	was walking there. The guy in the backseat of that car was
6733640	6736840	taking a giant poop. Is that why you're diarrhea, Junior?
6737340	6740640	And I mean could be maybe not intentionally, but yes,
6740840	6743540	sounds like an origin story. All right. Well, we definitely
6743540	6746440	then we yeah, we don't have to play D&D anymore. I was D&D.
6746440	6750840	I think I like doing the whole podcast. We book ended
6750840	6754140	this harm in town with prostate massage and poop
6754140	6756240	stories. All I wanted to talk about was the prostate
6756240	6761240	thing. I feel like as usual, you know, I found out who
6761240	6762240	my real friends are.
6765240	6767840	I like your hair and your beard Harmon. It's looking good.
6768240	6770740	You're looking more and more like a combination of several
6770740	6772540	of the captain's on deadliest catch.
6776740	6779440	I'm not going to let that make me trust you.
6781440	6784740	I like the sound of it. You remind me of you look like
6784740	6788840	you might go into the Bering Sea and you know, the Bering
6788840	6792840	Sea gives up its gold. You mean crab? Jesus Christ.
6792840	6794440	How many ways are you going to trick me to think the
6794440	6795440	show isn't boring?
6796640	6800040	Fucking A. All right. There's more crab coming out.
6801340	6806040	The Bering Sea gives up its gold. Crab, you mean say crab.
6807240	6810340	Police their language, won't you? I don't watch the show.
6812040	6814740	I watch an episode in the hotel. I don't watch a lot of TV
6814740	6819040	hotel TVs. I watched a episode of Wicked Tuna and one of
6819040	6821440	the boats are from Massachusetts. One of the tuna
6821440	6824140	boats is called Wicked Pissa. Oh, but Jeff, you want to
6824140	6827240	promote. You don't want to promote, but I want to check
6827240	6829840	out this like Forged in Fire reality show.
6831340	6837140	Fucking fire and church and I made church watch some church.
6837140	6840540	You still have it. Forged in Fire is good fun.
6840540	6843540	So it's a bunch of dudes that are all clearly like kind
6843540	6845240	of late respect spectrum.
6845240	6849440	Me nerds who like probably cosplay or they're not good
6849440	6851940	around people and they have a forge and they have to make
6851940	6854540	historical weapons and it's great.
6854540	6859540	It's a testament to our society that we are murdering
6859540	6864040	so many people per minute that you can now unlike in the
6864040	6868340	80s when Dungeons and Dragons was of concern to parents
6868340	6871440	because it's simulated the idea of edged weapons.
6871740	6874840	You can now have a reality show on TLC or whatever.
6874840	6878940	It's like yes, this acts which I recommend you kids at
6878940	6883240	home. Try making because if you do you'll only be able
6883240	6886140	to kill one person per police taser.
6886140	6888540	It's like chop the show is like chopped but hilariously
6888540	6891040	it's chopped the name chopped was already taken so they
6891040	6892140	can't go. Sorry.
6892140	6894940	Like one of you one of your blades is not up to snuff.
6895240	6897140	You've been chopped that would be perfect.
6897140	6898940	Right. They've already took that for a cooking show.
6899040	6901640	So they go your blade did not make the cuts but the whole
6901640	6904540	point anyone wants to be in that show is a Doug Makeda
6904540	6908440	of the the Asian ish martial artists edged weapon master
6909140	6912240	will do a kill test on a ballistics Demi with fake ribs
6912240	6917040	and blue gel organs and they'll just take a Viking battle
6917040	6921140	axe and kill a fake person and or it's chop a hog in half
6921640	6927040	and they go your blade will kill that's the best that's
6927040	6929940	the you're fired of your blade.
6930940	6936740	And you actually want to hear it because God I mean we
6936740	6940740	would love right now for our entire Society to be just like
6941240	6943940	if we could right now in exchange for everything else
6944040	6947440	we would give every child at birth a double-headed battle
6947440	6951440	axe cliffhanger.
