0	20240	Hello, Arlington. Guess what? I've got very good news. Harman Town is now in session.
20240	26000	Welcome to the Arlington Draft House. Won't you please welcome the mayor of Harman Town,
26000	37200	Dan Harman. Dan Harman. He's got a camera on his head. Dan Harman. There's a camera on his
37200	44400	head. Dan Harman. He got a camera on his head. You all have to sign a release form later because
44400	50080	he has a camera on his head. He's got a camera on his head. I got a camera on my head,
50880	54960	but that doesn't matter because the most important 300 people are here in Arlington.
56000	63680	Welcome. 10 minutes from the front door of the forces that oppress us. Fuck these guys.
65360	69200	You mean Washington, D.C.? Yeah, man. Aren't we like 10 minutes from the White House?
70320	76160	I don't know. Yeah. With traffic, maybe 18. There's no traffic?
77680	84480	You guys in this town, you want to talk about politics tonight, right? No, you love it.
84480	88800	That's why you live here. Do you want to talk about politics? Are you going to wear that camera
88800	94240	on your head the whole show? Once the red light goes out, it means we're out of, what do you call it,
94240	100640	film now or footage? iCloud? Whatever's in there, it'll run out. I'll take it off pretty soon.
100640	104720	Aren't you concerned about brain cancer? You got a thing on your head. I'm getting kind of a high
104720	111600	off of the reduced blood flow. It's sort of a perfect thing. Lean forward, Dan, and show them
111600	119200	what can only be described as a jockstrap on your head. It's like a biker's helmet without the
119200	125760	protection and all the capacity to film your impending doom. Let's do an experiment. Let's
125760	132720	get Spencer out here immediately. All right. We've never done it. Dan, we've never... Hang on,
132720	139840	Spencer. Wait. Spencer. Spencer. We've never brought him up this earlier. It's like in chess,
139840	144640	bringing the queen out too early. They warned you not to bring your queen out too early in
144640	152800	chess, Dan. You see a four-armed Spencer emerge from the bushes. He has an apple sweatshirt on
152800	162480	and a full beard full of beardness. He takes his seat way too early in the show. He is Spencer.
163440	171040	Thank you for joining us, Spencer. Spencer. Thanks. Again, for those of you that possibly
171040	175520	don't know who Spencer is, Spencer is our dungeon master we've been traveling with. At some point
175520	181840	in the show, we play Dungeons and Dragons with Spencer, who has truly been a wonderful companion
181840	189840	on the road. Thank you. And an indispensable Spencer. Dispensurable? It doesn't matter.
190240	197200	Can I get more plosives on my poo? Can we turn my mic down a bit? Can we get a winter
197200	200640	Bach and a windscreen for Jeff? Yeah. All these mugs. Poop.
207200	215600	My check. That's better. Thank you. Hama town is the place to be. Saw your mama with an ant
215600	225520	and a bee. Insect colony. I saw your mama on the butt. All right. That was just gibberish.
225520	228560	Confession. A couple of those last words weren't real words,
230000	236800	but the art form of it is that's how insects talk. That was trophallaxis. It was vomit drop.
236800	252480	Insect rap. How about a real rap? Here in Arlington? Oh, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
253120	259760	Yo, yo, Arlington. Oh, yo, yo, yo. Place to be in a town I don't know.
260320	265200	Fuck your mama in the rain and the snow. I'm like a mailman. Do it in weathers.
265200	273200	Oh, fuck your mama with Carl Weathers. Okay. You're not ready yet. Let me warm up.
273200	278720	We just met these people. Yeah, I'm sorry. We predicted backstage. We always do this. We're
278720	282400	like, there's a potential this will be a weird show. Like we don't know. Like this is a weird
282400	288080	seating thing. For those of you in podcast land, we've got a perfect storm of comfort and alienation.
289280	292720	We're looking at everybody here as their own captain Picard. They've all got these.
295600	301360	They're all in this beautiful exactly what it is. They're all in great reclining leather
301360	307840	thrones. Every single audience member of the Arlington draft house gets a enterprise bridge
307840	316960	captain's chair. And the fear which is fantastic to see the expendables too. It's a great place
316960	321600	to watch a Quentin Tarantino movie. It might be a horrible place to interact with me. Like you guys
321600	328240	are all you, you seem more powerful to me. Any, any one of you could, could tell us whether or not
328240	336080	to engage at any point. They've all engaged in baskets of fries. Like this is the height of
336080	339600	comfort. Literally people have plates in front of them and it's not chosen.
339600	348480	Plates. Plates. Plates. Plosives. Plosives. Microphones. Print screen.
348480	355040	Occupation zero. P hero. There's a little audio humor for you.
356560	362000	Uh, yeah, everyone is in a, is in a state of the art IKEA rolling office chair.
362000	367760	And they, and every two people has a, any wonderful form like a table
367760	371600	full loaded with the appetizers and beverages of their choices. And I just feel like Dan,
372320	377200	we might be the only comedy show to ever be the headliner for a Twilight movie.
379040	382720	Was anyone here? Did anyone have to come in, watch a Twilight movie, then leave and come back?
382720	387440	Who was here and watched Twilight and came back for us? Thank you. Thank you. Nobody.
388240	394560	Nice. Thank God for that. Okay. I'm not joking. I've never seen a Twilight. I don't know what
394560	398880	a Twilight, I mean, I know what Twilight is. I know it's the thing between light and night,
398880	406320	but, uh, uh, is it, is it vampires or, or, or chupacabras or, uh, werewolves? It's vampires.
408240	414960	Huh? Vampires and werewolves? There's a few werewolves. Yeah. But they're like Native Americans.
415120	421440	Wait, the werewolves are like Native Americans? Yeah. They're not true. They're not afflicted by
421440	429280	lycanthropy. They're Native Americans who are more, they can shape shift into these
429280	439760	CG wolf creatures. In a world where you notice has no hiding place. I don't know. Shut up.
445360	450560	Arlington draft house number one in accommodations for the talent coming through. I will say that,
450560	454880	right? We're not going to offend anybody by saying that. Certainly not. We got ushered in here and
454880	459440	the guy whose job it is to kick your ass if you get on a line is, is also, he'll bring you chicken
459440	465680	fingers and he'll do both with equal facility, I believe, and with, and with equal pride in his
465680	471040	job. He was, I kept going like, I don't, we were asked before the show by a lovely guy named Jesse.
471040	475680	He's like, if, let me know if like anybody in the audience gets too wild and wooly or too
475680	481120	interactive, you know, like I'll take care of it. We're like, if we call your name out, Jesse, that
481120	488320	means. And only if we call your name out. Yeah. Jesse, don't, no, no. He's not Beetlejuice. If I
488320	495280	say his name three times. What if Jesse turned out to be the problem? What if, what if as soon as he
495280	498800	is like, okay, they started the show and then he goes in the back and he ties his arm off and he
498800	506640	like shoots him smack, secure, special security smack. It's all like a little black bag that says
507200	511920	security on it. And then he, and then he's like, comes out here and he's like, why did you shut
511920	523520	the fuck up? You're not safe enough. Uh, yeah. So, uh, first in the accommodations of the talent, I,
523520	527280	I, I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of, I got a belly full of deep fried chicken fingers. This is our,
527280	532240	this is our first show on, this is day, what, eight? Gotta be something. I think it's, it's not
532240	536480	day eight, but it's our eighth show. And I think in nine days, this is our only show where we
536480	542880	didn't have a hotel. We are, our tour bus is like a block and a half away and we, uh, we, we landed
542880	548720	at five o'clock PM. It's now 10 or so at 30 PM. And, uh, we just like got dressed on the bus and
548720	556080	have been wandering, uh, Columbia Pike or wherever the fuck we are. And, uh, and so this is the least,
556080	564000	uh, together you're going to see us. Oh, Spencer. So one of the guys making the documentary, we were
564000	568320	at this Thai food restaurant and one of them said, Hey, are you all right? And he's like, yeah, I'm
568320	573600	fine. And they said, are you going to be able to dungeon master that? And he said, yeah, uh,
573600	580240	give me the name of a monster. And someone said werewolf. And he said, leaping from the bushes,
580320	587440	it's arms raised in aggression and protest of werewolf stars. Yeah. Should we try that out
587440	593200	right now? Let's, let's try a couple. Uh, so Spencer, uh, anyone from the audience, uh,
593200	598000	do you have a, think of it, not a real monster, make up a new monster. Like something out of your
598000	606800	own imagination, the what the tooth beast Spencer, the tooth beast, you hear the gnashing and grinding
606800	614800	of ivory against ivory. I'm going to fucking die. I'm going to die. Should I even go on at that
614800	618720	point? Are we good? No, no, you should. I mean, you could, or you couldn't. It doesn't matter.
619280	628080	I'm going to die. I'm going to die of happiness. You hear the gnashing and missing Spencer. Um,
628080	635680	I, I was, I was pretty sure I loved you the moment we met you at meltdown. Now what do you do? And
635920	642720	it's grown and grown by, you know, a very, you know, logical geometrical, you know, like line.
642720	649840	That's what we call a direct correlation. That's just the only, you're only making it more
649840	657920	exponential. Your, your curve gets parabolic as it exponentializes into the hazy mist of
657920	666160	mathematical curvature as, as X becomes closer to Y. And I don't know. You hear the
666160	672160	gnashing and meshing of ivory against a magic of ivory. It's like right off the top. Like Dan
672160	678880	and I, we both have speech impediments. Uh, like Dan goes, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
678880	683920	I don't, I start, I start, I start, I, I, I, I start sentences like a bunch of times like,
683920	687760	too. Like I have a lot of, you, you have the Hugh Grant. I have the, uh, Woody Allen, maybe.
689200	698640	Jimmy Stewart, Hugh Grant, uh, versus Woody Allen. But Spencer, you, you speak so distinctly, uh,
698640	702640	like there's no stuttering. There's no ums or errs or us or whatever. It's just, it's, it's,
702640	707120	it's very, uh, articulate, very specific, very precise. If you say so.
707120	718880	I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I do. Can we unveil my, my, my, my partial bridge to the chicken noodle
718880	724960	dick, uh, song? Uh, I want to, I don't know if Jeff approves of it yet, but this is what I came
724960	735440	up with. I, I, I, I, I, I hear. Here I am. I ain't got a dick. I got a chicken noodle can.
736080	742400	All my life I've been putting this can inside my chicken noodle wife. Chicken noodle God come down
742400	747200	from the mountains and chicken noodle man. You gotta work all day. Chicken noodle man. You gotta
747200	752880	cross the river Jordan. Feed the devil soup until your troubles go away. Soup to the bowl, bowl to
752880	762080	the spoon, spoon to the mouth. You're gonna get well soon. That's all I got. Soup to the bowl, bowl
762080	765840	to the spoon, spoon to the mouth. You're gonna get well soon. It's not really, it's not really a
765840	769760	bridge. It's another verse. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. We need a musician
769760	774160	to write us. Like we need to move to like a minor key. I don't know what it is nor did the people
774160	781760	who built our nation's railroads. Like they didn't go to music college. They went by instinct and God,
781760	787440	like God went through them. When you, when you break a man down to his fundamentals, he becomes
787440	792880	Beethoven. Like they didn't need to know. Oh, oh, uh, is it, is it the bridge or the, or the chorus?
792880	798400	I don't fucking know. Like put it, put another fucking, uh, uh, railroad, uh, uh, hinge in the,
798400	804320	uh, in the, uh, in the, uh, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, in the rail,
804320	814560	rail, rail, rail pocket. Uh, uh, Spencer, uh, railroad monster. You hear the sound of far off
814560	822640	pistons firing. Steam rises to the east. You hear the horrendous grinding of teeth
823360	832080	and then you see it. Half man, half locomotive, all monster. He's fucking so good. He's so good.
832080	844800	He's a national treasure. He's a national, he's a national treasure whose parents dropped him off
844800	851040	at the bus. I have a picture of Spencer and his mom and dad and uh, they look like our age. Yeah,
851040	856000	of course. And they're like older than you guys. Barely. Your mom was in my chemistry class.
857360	861520	My mom's like 20 years older than you. It still, it doesn't matter. What's their secret Spencer?
861520	865280	Why do your parents look so youthful? Um, they drain the souls of other people.
866800	873360	Uh, uh, Spencer, parent monsters, parent monster opening the door to your room.
874240	876400	You quickly turn off your computer screen.
884000	885040	Jesus Christ.
887280	889440	Why are we up here and why are you back there?
890160	893040	This whole thing is fucking backwards. That's what I just thought is like,
893040	899760	tonight, that's what's important about tonight. I officially cede the show to Spencer. Yeah.
900400	910240	Abdicate. Jeez Louise. Oh man. That's a super power. Uh, you know, there was a conversation
910240	915680	on a tour bus and Dan is busy like sitting in the front section, uh, which I, I call the,
916080	920880	the folks all of the, of our tour of our tour bus, the forecast. So it's called folks.
921840	927280	Any sailors out there? Yeah. Good stuff. Yeah. It's a couple of sailors. That's safe to assume.
936320	940800	It is our nation's capital, but we're near Annapolis, Maryland. There might be some
940880	945840	midshipmen out there, right? Of course there usually is any bachelorette parties.
948320	957200	No, it's, it's harmonians. They, it's, it's, yeah, it's, he loves his yacht. Spencer, Spencer,
957200	965680	yacht monster off the port back. You see a spout of rising water.
965840	972000	I don't know. That's all I got that time. It's all right. It's all right.
972960	977200	Freeze, freestyle DM. And I'm pretty sure that was Moby Dick, but that's still, that's still good.
979200	985600	You see a hump like a snow hell. There she blows. Quick, quick cried. Let me tell you about how knots
985600	992400	work. I think I know how they work. I just don't have a time. Any of them. I think they all work on
992400	997200	the principle of making rope hard to pin up. He was, he was making a joke about Moby Dick,
997200	1002640	which most of it is about the minutia of, you know, of being aboard a ship. Yeah. Read a book, people.
1005200	1013120	A literacy monster. You see a stumbling towards you. It looks at the sign standing in front of you.
1014160	1016320	It falls into the pit that was clearly labeled.
1016800	1026080	I'm going to fucking die of a goddamn pleasure attack on a stage here in Arlington. I'm going
1026080	1033840	to die of happiness. I have no, we got to stop. We stopped putting them on the spot. But this is
1033840	1037760	where we reveal that this whole thing has been a ruse that you and I are going to leave the stage.
1037760	1040800	Like we're going to pretend like, oh, we're demoralized. We're going to leave. And then
1040800	1044800	Spencer's going to leave and come out dressed like Dolly Parton. He's going to sing a song
1044880	1047600	and you're going to find out he can tap dance so he can do anything.
1047600	1049680	And then the usurpation will be complete.
1054320	1060400	Some Arlington facts, Jeff. You don't, okay, let's hear them. Dan boasts of his ability to,
1060400	1066880	while he's shirking his responsibilities for a screenplays or his TV show scripts, he, Wikipedia
1066880	1071440	is the town that we've just dropped into. So let's hear what you got, Dan. Jeff, did you know
1071440	1083040	that Arlington, Virginia is the rape state? So called by Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1910,
1085120	1088320	who was then six years old and had been raped by his own mother.
1089680	1092560	Who, let me finish, invented the typewriter.
1092560	1103840	In fact, we are in a fascinating historical. What a legacy. I mean, what a career.
1104960	1111360	Virginia was the 17th state to leave the union and the 14th state to join the union,
1113280	1117840	thereby creating a time paradox in which it fought itself in 1920,
1117840	1126320	which resulted in the development of copper wire and the telephone and the typewriter
1127040	1133200	and marshmallow cream and license plates. And the movie Jaws was shot here.
1135200	1144400	And I didn't look anything up. And they lead the nation in eternal flame technology.
1144400	1151680	Yes, you guys. Oh yeah, yeah, there's a lot of yes. Cemetery, cemetery culture here is more advanced
1151680	1162560	than than ancient Maya and Aztechia combined. The word Aztechia was invented here by Carl Reiner
1162960	1177520	in 1940. Thomas Edison choked to death here on a hooker. And that's where he got the idea
1177520	1188560	for the flux capacitor. Virginia was originally non-Virginia, but they felt the name was too
1188560	1196880	braggy. So it changed it to Virginia. Dan, who do you like better? Virginia, West Virginia,
1196880	1204560	or East Virginia? You know, I think all my favorites is mega Virginia. That's when all
1204560	1210560	the secret Virginia developed by NASA scientists that is in geosynchronous orbit with the other
1210560	1220080	five Virginias. And yeah, watches down on all of you. How many of you out here tonight are from
1220080	1229520	Virginia? A question for you guys. What is Virginia? Is it a county? A state? It's a state.
1229520	1238080	A Commonwealth. All right, don't get snippy. I've been everywhere. I'm like an astronaut now.
1238880	1244000	I'm walking in here with a swagger. I don't even know where I am.
1245680	1249600	No, we're 10 minutes from the White House. Let's scream something at him, Jeff.
1250800	1254320	We're tired of your bullshit. Why is it going to be white?
1261040	1264960	Why do I have to take my shoes off every time I go through the airport?
1264960	1275040	Stupid. How many 9-11s have you stopped? With shoes. With shoe absence. For all we know,
1275040	1280240	a hundred. For all we know, none. And we do know. Because every time they stop when they go,
1280240	1287280	he had a thing in his shoe! He had a thing in his shoe! They get excited about it. But if somebody
1287280	1291360	else blew up some heavy shit, they wouldn't call that a 9-11. They'd probably call it whatever date
1291360	1296720	that happened on. They'd call it a 414 or something like that. They'd call it either 9-12 or 10-11,
1298000	1308560	right? Wouldn't they? What if it happened in the spring? No. Oh, September? I just got that.
1310560	1314400	I just got that. I thought it was like 9-1-1.
1314400	1329200	You know, every day since I was like in middle school, you've loved me. Come to me.
1330320	1337680	No. I look at the clock. Ever since I was very young, and I see 9-11 on a clock once or twice a
1337680	1342720	day. It's constant. I can wake up out of a sleep and pick up my phone and look at it. 9-11. No.
1342720	1347920	I see it all the time. No. I do. I saw it today. I saw it today once. That's a phenomenon. I read
1347920	1352240	about it on the internet. Your brain attributes significance to 9-11, and your brain works
1352240	1357680	backwards and forwards. I was in middle school way before 9-11. And you remember seeing 9-11 a lot
1357680	1363440	before 9-11 happened? Yeah. No. Because back then it was 9-1-1. It was the emergency call
1364160	1368480	number. And I would always see 9-1-1, and it got to the point where it used to scare me,
1368480	1371840	but then I would see 9-1-1. Like if I would get into a friend's car, and if I'd pop in,
1371920	1375360	and I would look at their digital clock, and it would go 9-11, and I would see it. And it was
1375360	1379840	like seeing the face of a friend. So now when I see it, I go like, hey, buddy. And then when
1379840	1383920	9-11 happened, that all changed, because now it's a whole different thing. Well, moving on with our
1383920	1390080	facts about Arlington. Highest probability of anyone in the audience having lost a loved one
1390080	1404240	during 9-11. Yeah. And we're doing bits about it. Yo, sensitive stuff. Marshmallow fluff invented
1404240	1413440	in Somerville, but here's where you invented 9-11. It's a little less appetizing, a claim to fame,
1413440	1421360	but he did it. Congratulations. Wisconsin. What did Wisconsin do? Shoes. I think we invented shoes.
1422640	1428640	Cheese. Okay. They invented Dan Herman then, as this gentleman says. All right, come on. Let's
1428640	1437760	move on. Let's meet some people. Let's stir some shit up. Do we have a representative of Arlington,
1437760	1442080	Virginia out there? Anybody who feels like they have something to add? Do we have anybody that
1442160	1450720	believes in ghosts? Isn't this a big ghost state? Has anybody ever had an encounter with a ghost?
1451360	1456800	A real one. Holy shit, nobody. I think we just disproved ghosts.
1459280	1462320	Get up here. Get up here. What's your name, sir? Adam's coming up.
1464320	1466080	We'll be with you in a second, probably, too.
1466080	1473120	I thought maybe because we're on the east coast, there's more ghosts on the east coast.
1474720	1478960	No, it's true. It used to be called the East Ghost. That's how it got its name.
1481040	1490480	Adam, tell us your ghost story. I was like eight or nine years old, and I was in my parents'
1490480	1494160	bedroom early on a Sunday morning. That was no ghost, Adam.
1496080	1501520	It's called an erection. It was haunting, but natural.
1501520	1508320	But I looked across the room, and all of a sudden, I saw this dark shadow figure,
1508320	1513040	and I think its head popped off and was bouncing back and forth against the walls.
1515280	1518720	Oh my God, I just had a realization. Oh my God, what a breakthrough.
1518720	1523280	No, wait. I'm sorry. You saw a dark figure. You were in your parents' bedroom.
1524240	1527920	Were they the dark figure coming? Yeah, we were all in the bed together,
1527920	1531600	because that's not weird. How are you, eight, nine?
1531600	1536000	I was eight or nine, maybe. I slept with my mom a lot during my parents' separation.
1539280	1545280	Did you see a dark figure enter the room? My parents' separated, and my mom moved to
1545280	1552560	South Milwaukee. We never pronounced the H there. She was living above her mom's place,
1552560	1559280	my grandma. Every night, I would hear her calling on the phone to my dad and going,
1559280	1563760	I don't know what's going on. It was emotionally put me in a bubble.
1565680	1571280	I remember sleeping in my mom's bed, because I could have sworn my mom wanted me to. I could
1571280	1578880	have sworn it was not my choice. I bet I was all fucked up, too. This is the most distinct
1578880	1586720	emotional memory I have. My dad came over to visit my mom. They were separated, and my dad
1587680	1594000	came over and was like, I guess we're going to go to the zoo, Tiki. That was my nickname.
1594000	1601520	Wait, sorry, what? Let's get back to that later. My nickname was Tiki. Then my mom said,
1602400	1608400	can I talk to you alone for a second? To my dad. That meant I had to leave. I left the room,
1608400	1613200	but I listened to the door, because it was like, what the fuck? I guess they're going to talk
1613200	1619680	about me, obviously. They're not going to talk about the stock market. My mom really threw me
1619680	1626800	under the bus. I listened, but I had the door, and I heard my mom go, this is really fucking up
1626800	1636000	your son. Do you know he sleeps in bed with me every night? It's traumatizing him. I remember
1636000	1650400	thinking, you bitch. You hit on me. You wanted it. I feel that way about my mom sometimes, Dan.
1651200	1658960	For real? Yeah, she's constantly very really, really affectionate, but almost to a point that
1658960	1667120	it feels almost sexualized. It's really freaking weird. Or fake targeted? No, not fake. Do you
1667120	1671680	have siblings? I have one older brother, but we have different moms. They say there's a thing
1672720	1681280	referred to as silent seduction, where a mother will pick one of two or more male offspring,
1681280	1686800	and that one receives all of the love, all of the affection. Because she wants to change. All the
1686800	1692400	craziness, all the anger. That's absolutely true. Yeah, so I think I had that one too. You're
1692400	1699200	involved in an unwitting emotional kind of relationship, a dating relationship with this
1699200	1707120	woman. Yeah, it keeps me out sometimes. That's why I don't live here anymore. Did you get to an age
1707120	1713280	when I remember being like 12 or 13 and my mom coming up behind me and kind of giving me a shoulder
1713280	1718320	rub, and then me going like, knock it off. I think that's just a puberty thing, right? Like you
1719520	1724560	stop touching me. She was going through puberty? No, I was. I think the reason I remember it is
1724560	1729600	because I was like, I decided, okay, no more affection. I'm a man now. I don't want my mom
1729600	1734000	to touch me. Or does she see you going through puberty and goes, I'm going to get this for her.
1734000	1741520	A man? Yeah, I don't know, man. God damn it. We need more open books on this stuff. You hear me,
1741520	1747440	White House? So Adam, where's your committee on this shit? Stop making us take our shoes off at
1747440	1752640	the airport and start figuring on our mom's brains. Why do they want to fuck us so bad?
1753360	1757520	So Adam, you feel like you with a lightning rod for all of your mother's attention in that way?
1757520	1763200	Oh, and when it comes to the craziness, definitely. My parents got divorced like four years ago,
1764240	1769040	which I was surprised by. It usually doesn't happen that much later in a person's life. I
1769040	1775520	was 21 when it happened. And basically whenever you're in a bar and your dad comes up, it's not
1775520	1781680	your fault. It's important for you to know. My dad doesn't even talk about that sort of stuff or
1781680	1786720	anything real for that matter. I remember my dad trying to talk to me about our parents' separation
1786720	1791360	and me getting so embarrassed. I was reading a Spiderman comic on the front seat of our station
1791360	1796960	wagon and my dad finally started to broach the subject. Way too late, way too late. Everything
1797280	1801440	luggage was moved. Everything was topsy turvy. And I was reading a Spiderman comic. I had
1801440	1804560	already figured out how to deal with it, which was to shut down and become autistic.
1806960	1812480	Or commit to an already prevalent autism. And my dad was driving and he just, I don't know,
1812480	1819920	he was like, you know, your mother and I are going through some changes. And I was like,
1820880	1829520	focus on the Spiderman. You know, it's important for you to know it's not your fault. It's just
1829520	1835440	stumbling through this thing. And I was like, no, finish it up and play them off. And then they're
1835440	1839760	being in this pause and they go, you know, it's just important for you to know that if you stop
1839760	1847200	reading your fucking comic book, you got really mad. And I was like, I know. God, Jesus. I remember
1847200	1852160	that moment too. Like you made my dad like reaching out to me. It was just painful.
1852160	1853840	I said, let's connect here. Let's look.
1853840	1856720	Yeah, but it was too late and too artificial, too focused.
1856720	1858000	And how old were you at that point?
1858000	1861120	Probably 10, 11 or not 11.
1867280	1870640	Spencer just disaffected emotional parent monster.
1871840	1872640	Hold up, hold up.
1872640	1880240	Trying to get her attention, your mother looks over with a lazy glazed over look.
1881280	1885280	She seems exhausted as if the weight of the world rest on her shoulders.
1886560	1889600	You think that this might not be the best time to ask for ice cream.
1892000	1895200	I'm going to fucking die.
1897440	1901920	All right. So Adam, your ghost, the ghost, a dark figure comes in, the head's popping about
1902000	1903040	and then moving about, right?
1903040	1906560	Yeah, it's just sort of popping about and like making this sort of hissing sound. All I can
1906560	1910080	really remember is like, I couldn't breathe at all.
1910080	1910720	That's a thing.
1910720	1912080	I couldn't breathe, I couldn't move.
1915360	1920640	Sorry, I'm stammering, but I remember being in my bed. That's a thing. There's a chemical
1920640	1925280	in your brain that paralyzes you when you're asleep, right? So that you don't, if you have
1925280	1929280	a dream that you're like fucking a hot dog, that you don't get up and fuck a hot dog.
1929840	1935520	And which won't be a hot dog. It'll be the ironing board and you'll hurt your family.
1941040	1944880	When you go into deep sleep, they're supposed to be like, your body can't move. And so your
1944880	1948480	brain goes into this state where no matter how much flailing around you're doing in your sleep,
1949120	1952880	you're not actually moving. But then there's this weird thing that happens. We've all had
1952880	1958560	this experience, probably everyone in this room, where you wake up and you're fully awake,
1958560	1965680	but that chemical has still paralyzed your body. And you can't move. You're awake and you can't
1965680	1970160	move. And sometimes you can't breathe. That hasn't happened yet? I've never had that.
1970160	1972160	That's sleep paralysis. Yeah, that happens.
1973360	1978240	For me, they say, your dreams, when you're trying to run or just even jog up a hill,
1978240	1984400	that your legs are sluggish and you can't move. That's your brain knowing that the chemicals your
1984400	1989600	brain administers while you sleep to make you really just fall asleep and your eyelids shut
1989600	1995520	and everything work and shut down. Your brain knows that. So you're kind of paralyzed during
1995520	2000240	your dreams. I've never had that in my waking state. So when people are, yeah, all this shit
2000240	2004400	that happens to you in your sleep, it's all just various combinations of different sleep disorders.
2004400	2008400	Like sometimes that paralysis chemical is not working right, which is sleepwalking.
2008400	2012880	But Adam, were you awake? Did you feel that? Yeah, like I had been awake for a few minutes
2012880	2017920	when it happened. And all I remember is I was hearing, you know, the hissing sound and the head
2017920	2022960	popping back and forth. And I kept wanting to say something like wake my parents. Yeah, you want to
2022960	2028160	scream. And I couldn't. And then like the next thing I knew it just disappeared. Yeah. But then
2028160	2036160	after it disappeared, did you then go? Even though it was too late. That's what I did. I remember
2036160	2042160	like waking up. I remember being wide awake in my bed when I was like 17. And I remember
2042160	2051680	the full on perfectly vivid image of an absolute like corporeal woman like a witch in a black robe,
2052560	2058160	starting from the corner of my bedroom behind my bedroom door, taking full strides over to my bed
2058160	2065200	and like, like, like, like covering, like getting in my face, like, like a real person. And I was
2065200	2071280	wide awake. And I just couldn't move while she was doing it. And then it kind of like disappeared in
2071280	2077840	the cloud. But I was wide awake and in cold sweats. And then as soon as I regained my faculties,
2077840	2085840	I went 17. So embarrassing. They say they see rolled over and goes, What is it?
2089040	2096000	Real nice, Jeff. And I said, step giving me shoulder rubs and get to the real deal.
2096000	2101840	All right. Is there is there anybody in our audience? And don't be embarrassed. Don't you're
2101840	2107440	not going to get bullied, like for real, like by I guess by applause only because we can't see you.
2107440	2112000	Is there anybody who is like, you're just waving for is there anybody in the audience that wants
2112000	2120480	to just wave? But beyond that, is there anybody in the audience that believes in alien abduction,
2120480	2123680	like mythology, like, like, like the idea that there are aliens?
2125440	2127760	How about a woman? Any gals here believe in it?
2130080	2133680	Well, there was applause. Anybody want to come up and talk about it?
2134400	2137280	Is there anybody willing to come up and talk about it a little bit?
2137280	2137920	You believe in it, right?
2139680	2144000	He's not a lady, but he believes in it. Let's welcome whoever you are. What's your name, sir?
2144640	2153120	Casey to the stage, everybody. Spencer, alien monster. Is that a okay? You see a circular beam
2153120	2160080	of light floating down from the heavens is a green ghastly figure with a large oversized head.
2161360	2169920	It's like an alien. All right. Jeez. That was that was too over the plate. Yeah. I don't do sci-fi.
2170480	2176400	Message there. Spencer's bored. That was the message. Some bullshits happening.
2176400	2183200	Go to Hot Topic if you want this kind of crap. I cater to a specific crowd. Go fuck yourself.
2183760	2188400	All right, Casey. You believe in alien encounters, abductions?
2188400	2194640	Yeah, sure. I mean, is it based on anything? What do you base that belief on?
2194640	2196160	That it would be rad.
2196160	2202000	Is that it would be rad? Yeah. That's why I believe in hot tub parties.
2203440	2207920	I was writing a screenplay when I was like 23 ish or something like that. That was an
2207920	2214640	alien abduction comedy. It's going to be like a new Ghostbusters. And I started researching
2214640	2219280	all this alien abduction shit and it got really freaked out because I got frequent nosebleeds as
2219280	2222880	a kid and I had all these, you know, like my stuff when I was asleep and I started experiencing,
2222880	2229760	you know, like it gets in your head. I thought that I really thought aliens were
2230960	2237920	abducting me, Jeff. I mean, people have instances where they have blacked out or something weird
2237920	2241040	has happened and then the next morning you wake up and there's a physiological difference. Maybe
2241040	2248080	you lost some hair or an ear or something. An ear? Aliens may have occurred.
2248080	2253360	Is anyone in the audience? Does anyone in the audience think they've been abducted by an alien?
2254480	2261680	Applaud if you can. If you can overcome your telepathic chip. So Casey, you're just saying
2261680	2267360	your mind is open to that possibility that you think that people you believe you want to believe
2267360	2273840	that people have been interacted with by aliens. Yeah. My mind is unencumbered. But in that way,
2274800	2281200	that's real groovy, Jackson. Mine too. I mean, I wouldn't rule it out. Why bother ruling anything
2281200	2288560	in? I don't believe in ghosts. I have a logical, skeptical mind. I don't believe that ghosts come
2288560	2294800	around and fuck with you and go and throw a plate across the room. However, I had an apartment that
2294800	2299920	is now our friend Rob Schwab's apartment. Rob Schwab is how I know Dan Harmon. They were writing
2299920	2307200	partners and I had to move out of an apartment in LA, Casey, and it was a great apartment. But I
2307200	2311200	couldn't afford it because my roommate moved out and I was broke. But the day that my friend and I
2311200	2317520	moved in, it was Halloween, but we didn't think about that. And also the number, the prefix for
2317520	2323280	the phone number that the telephone company wanted to give us was 666 because mine is 665.
2324320	2329200	That's like 664, 663. That's that neighborhood. But they can't get rid of the 666s because
2329840	2335680	people, you know, are Catholic and shit, you know, or whatever. So my roommate was Irish Catholic.
2335680	2341840	He's like, oh no, I can't do that. My mother will never call me. She'll never call. And so we got
2341840	2345680	another number. And so we check in this new place. We were the third residents to ever live there,
2345680	2350800	but the apartment was built in the 50s. The first resident, a LAPD homicide detective,
2350800	2354480	and then an old married couple. And the husband died, not in that apartment,
2355120	2359200	I don't know, hospital rather. And the wife moved to a one-bedroom in the building.
2359200	2364560	So we move in. It's a great place. And every time the two of us were out of the house,
2364560	2368400	out of the apartment, something crazy happened. We bought a brand new clock. Every time we left,
2368400	2372560	we come back, the clock will be stopped at a certain time. And all of the pictures on the wall
2372560	2376640	would be off the wall, but thrown across the hallway to the opposite side and broken.
2377920	2382320	Yeah. So if a painting was on the right side of the hallway, it would be thrown to the left
2382320	2387600	side of the hallway and smashed and left to right and smashed. And things would be tipped
2387600	2392240	over and broken. So we thought, okay, somebody has our keys and they're coming in, they're
2392240	2398400	wrecking our place. So we asked Helene, the widow of the dead guy, who'd lived there for 35 years,
2399280	2403280	does anybody else have these keys? No, we just put new locks on. I don't even have the keys.
2403280	2409040	You and the landlord. And he's this 80-year-old guy, like only you guys have the keys. So usually
2409600	2413600	the other, me and Paul would be at the apartment at one time, because we had very different
2413600	2418880	schedules, because I was an alcoholic and he was an animator. So he was up early and I was out
2420320	2426320	dancing. So we were usually, somebody was at home, but any time the two of us went to the
2426320	2430560	market together, we'd come home and everything was busted. The pictures were all thrown around,
2430560	2437280	clocks would stop, and the bathtub would, there'd be like, just matter everywhere.
2437280	2443200	Like not like stuff, like if the drain spat out stuff or not if it backed up. There was just a
2443200	2447760	random splatter pattern of stuff all over the bathtub. And we just thought someone's
2447760	2453920	fucking with us, like what's going on? That kind of goes away a little bit. We find there's an attic
2453920	2460720	in it. We go up into the attic and we look up and it's, you know, it's LA, it's like 78 degrees out
2460720	2465520	always. And in the attic, it should be hotter because the heat rises. I get up into the attic
2465600	2468960	and I look up and I see some old Christmas decorations and stuff. And instantly the
2468960	2475360	temperature drops to like what feels like 55 degrees, like outside the draft house right now.
2475360	2481440	And it was like, instantly just crazy chill comes over me. I kind of get this weird feeling. And I
2481440	2486800	don't think, ooh, scary ghosts. I just drop back down the little ladder. I go, Paul, go check it
2486800	2492880	out. There's some cool stuff up there. Like to get a real reading on this. And he cleans the
2492880	2498720	ladder and puts his head right down. He goes, Jeff, we're never going up there again. All right.
2498720	2503040	So time passes a little bit. I'm in my bedroom. I had the bedroom where the husband slept because
2503040	2506320	they were an old married couple. And I think you find that often they sleep in different rooms
2506320	2511280	because the husband snores and farts and the woman wants to get his night's sleep. And I had his room
2511280	2515040	and I was in, I was getting undressed. I'm down to my boxers and I just have a feeling that
2515040	2520400	absolutely somebody's behind me. Like somebody's like on the carpet behind me. And I turned around
2520400	2525200	and I'm like, okay, fucking enough. I never did shit. I had enough of this. You're dead.
2527520	2532800	You don't live here anymore. I live here now. So fucking stop it. Stop it.
2535120	2541200	And nothing ever happened again. So I still, it's just that simple story is far from over.
2541200	2544800	The only reason they made a bigger deal out of it in the Exorcist is because obviously that would
2544800	2554480	be a shitty movie. My roommate goes, what the hell's going on? I go, I just exercised my bedroom
2554480	2559920	as a fucking guy. So the end, I lived there for another eight months. Nothing weird ever happens.
2559920	2564240	I never thought the place was haunted. I just, there was this weird activity that kept happening.
2564240	2568720	But there was a time when I felt there was a motherfucker standing behind me and not because
2568720	2572400	the guy had died there. He didn't die there. I was not implanted with this knowledge. I didn't
2572400	2578880	really care about it. So Rob Schwab moves in a year later when I move out. And story is halfway
2578880	2586560	done. Oh, no, this is like page two of a hundred. So we're at a bar. Rob Schwab is at the drawing
2586560	2590720	room. It's at the burgundy room and Rob comes out and he just gets a screwdriver and just boom,
2590720	2596480	just drops it, gets a bartender, another, drinks it straight down, another. And he's drinking. I
2596480	2603440	go, Rob, what the fuck? I've never seen you drink like this. He's like, oh man, I don't want to go
2603440	2608240	home sober. I'm like, what's something wrong? Like with the girlfriend or the girl you're dating? He's
2608240	2613600	like, no, I don't know. It's stupid. I don't want to talk about it. I just don't. He's about to cry.
2613600	2620160	I'm like, what the fuck's going on? He goes, the place on Lowry is like, anything weird ever
2620160	2624400	happened there to you? And I was like, what do you mean? I still, again, I don't instantly
2624400	2628320	leap to ghosts. I never really thought that was good. Just a bunch of weird shit happened. And
2628320	2634480	he goes, I don't know. He's like, you slept in the bedroom I slept in, right? I sleep and I go,
2634480	2645920	yeah. And he goes, is it haunted? I go, oh yeah, totally. And Rob goes, don't say that. Don't say
2645920	2650480	that. He starts crying. I go, what happened? What the fuck happened? He goes, ever since I moved in
2650480	2655840	there, I hung all this artwork up. And every time I left the place and there was nobody in there,
2655840	2659440	I would come back and all the paintings were off the walls and they were all broken. Anytime I
2659440	2664080	hung a picture of somebody's face on it, all the pictures were gone and it was smashed across the
2664080	2669360	room. And last night, there was all this weird shit going on, but last night I was laying in bed
2669360	2674240	and I heard my bedroom door open and I heard somebody walking across the carpet into my room
2674240	2679120	and I felt the weight of a person's body getting onto my bed. And I was like, were you awake or were
2679200	2683120	you asleep? He's like, I was on my stomach, which is rare for me, but I looked at the clock and it
2683120	2687600	was 4, 10 a.m. and I thought, are Dan and Jeff still here? Did we watch a movie together? Like,
2687600	2691840	it's like, no, they're not here. He's like, I've had this conscious thought and I felt this person
2691840	2696080	get on top of me. And I thought, like I said, it's a burglar, like sort of burglars in my room or
2696080	2704640	rapists. Because it would never be Dan and Jeff. Certainly not. Not until tonight. And the weight
2704640	2708960	of a body got on top of him and he heard a voice in his ear going. And the voice said,
2709680	2714560	what are you doing in my room? And Rob jumped up across the room and nothing was there. So I went
2714560	2721680	with Rob to the apartment again and I went, get the fuck out of here, man. You're dead. Like Rob
2721680	2729200	made me go back and be the world's shittiest exorcist. This has been a Halloween, Halloween
2729200	2739120	Arlington, Arlington National Cemetery. Spooky, ooky, Harman toonies. The end.
2741680	2746880	Jesus Christ. I think you've told that story before on the podcast. Is that right? Yeah. I don't give a
2746880	2754160	shit. No. Yeah. In your face. All right. Thank God. All credibility is lost with a camera on your head.
2754400	2759120	All right. Casey, uh, uh, what do you want?
2762560	2766160	But I mean that in the actual, not the passive aggressive sense. Like what do you really want?
2766160	2770800	I mean like a simple, whatever that is you're drinking. Let me know. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
2770800	2777760	that goes without saying, yeah, load them up, load them up. But I mean, while you load that up,
2777760	2782720	I want to hear what you want. I don't care if it's a noun, an adjective, a sentence, a phrase,
2782720	2787280	a thought. Yeah. What's your dream? What do you want? We're going to, we're going to give it to you
2787280	2791440	figuratively. If you could go home tonight and tell your loved ones, uh, something happened
2791440	2800960	tonight, what would that be? Oh, joy. You want joy. Casey, did somebody boo? Joy.
2803280	2805840	We really are 10 minutes from the white house. If I did cakes,
2807120	2812000	no, no, no, not in that case. Don't cater to that. He said pancakes. He said pancakes. I thought he
2812080	2817040	said in that case, pancakes, joy and pancakes. The same thing. All right. Casey wants joy in
2817040	2825520	pancakes. Can we just real quick, Jeff? Oh, it's a wrap. All right. All right. What do you want?
2825520	2829440	I thought it would be like a movie, like a, like a quick movie, a movie called joy and pancakes.
2829440	2836960	Yeah. All right. Starring Casey. Okay. With me as Casey. And Casey as you? No, Casey's out of here.
2836960	2839760	Fuck him. Casey, everybody. Welcome Casey.
2850240	2858240	The year is 1939. Hitler's armies have crossed into Poland. World war two has begun.
2858240	2865520	In comets.
2871680	2876560	Sir, Lieutenant Casey reported for duty, sir. Where are my pancakes, soldier?
2877840	2880480	Sir, I tried to get them as far as Verdun, but I...
2880480	2883600	Soldier, stand in attention in front of your commanding officer.
2883600	2887920	Yes, sir. I apologize, sir. I lost your pancakes at Verdun, sir.
2887920	2890400	Verdun was world war one. You're in the wrong war, sir.
2891520	2898240	Smooth as war fighting in a wrong war. Yes, sir, sir. Yes, sir. World war two, sir,
2898240	2902400	sir. I tried to keep track of it, sir. I tried to make your pancakes, but I couldn't, sir.
2902400	2906160	World war was hamburger hill. Sir, you're making me hungry, sir.
2906160	2909680	No. That was in the future. Trick question. That was Korea.
2911920	2916160	Sir, D-day is coming. D-day? Does D stand for delicious?
2917120	2918960	I don't know, sir. I wasn't authorized.
2918960	2922320	Don't come back into my tent until you have pancakes, soldier. Do you hear me?
2922320	2926160	Or I'll send you to Leavenworth. Yes, sir. Even though we're not in the Navy.
2928720	2938160	I'm just a soldier without a war. Trying to bring pancakes, but I need more.
2939120	2948400	Don't know what place to shoot or duck. Germans in both wars don't give a fuck.
2953600	2958080	During my song, I wanted to cross enemy lines. There's a mortar attack. I gotta dive into this
2958080	2962000	factor. No, no, no. Englander? Si.
2967840	2972640	I speak a little English. I am a German pancakemeister.
2975520	2976320	Incoming.
2979680	2983600	I thought you were beatboxing. Forgive me. I am from the future.
2983760	2990160	Listen. This war is needless. War is all about destruction and annihilation and separation
2990160	2994960	between the people, the lines that connect a human from another human being.
2994960	3002560	I always had that sense. Can I tell you a simple story? Si.
3004720	3011360	About 11 years ago, before Rob Schrab lived in this apartment, I lived in an apartment
3011840	3021520	with an Irish roommate. And it was Halloween. And the phone company, it's six hours later.
3022640	3030240	Holy shit. The war is over. So then I climb up into the attic and I look around and I get
3030240	3036960	the weird, the temperature just changes. And so I go back down 12 years later.
3036960	3047920	And the Cold War is over. Or beginning. Or actually, we're right kind of in the middle
3047920	3054880	of the Cold War right now. Johan. Yes, Sebastian.
3056720	3057600	Casey for short.
3061680	3064800	I don't have much time left. I'm now 93.
3065040	3070640	I feel like I wasted about 24 years on a story about a ghost.
3071280	3073600	It's okay. I really should have just given you
3073600	3078480	a recipe for pancakes that could have stopped both World War I and World War II.
3078480	3084480	You see, I am a timeless pancakemeister. Yes, I was there at the Battle of Valley Forge.
3085760	3088880	Yes, I was there. Flashback to Valley Forge.
3089040	3095600	Washington soldiers, charge. I'm George Washington.
3097520	3102480	Cross it. Keep crossing it. Don't stop. They're gonna, you're gonna be
3102480	3108080	challenged. Get your pancakes. Get your German future pancakes.
3109200	3113360	Sir, sir, my name is George Washington. I'm trying to cross this area. You need to get
3113360	3117520	clear, sir. Get clear. I would give you, George Washington, the recipe to my secret
3117520	3122560	German future pancakes. However, if I did that, war would end, but I cannot do that.
3122560	3129680	You see, I am here to cast a sad light on humanity. You see, war is a perpetual state
3129680	3134320	of humanity. Hey man, I don't, my teeth are made of wood. I don't have time for this
3134320	3138240	climb. They're not made of wood. They are not made of wood. That is a lie. Their hippopotamus bone.
3138240	3147600	Flash forward to the, the spine of the, yeah, you were at Valley Forge. Yeah.
3149440	3155760	So anyway, I, throughout time I could, I could have given Alexander the Great Napoleon pancakes
3155760	3162000	and all wars would have ended. But you see, I withhold pancakes because war is a part of,
3162000	3165600	it's a part of who we are. It's a part of this nutritious breakfast
3165600	3172000	of humanity. It's part of this nutritious breakfast of humanity. Like the orange juice is
3172000	3178880	pain and the, and the milk is. Casey, don't worry about war. Wars will solve themselves.
3178880	3188960	What you should worry yourself most with is aliens. Cut to Manhattan 2019 A.D.
3188960	3198080	hover car hover car in the news. Neo president fuckface who did the thing with a, it's not a
3198080	3205360	dirty word anymore. And language is changing postage stamps or the new fuel pennies are worth
3205360	3215520	a dollar. Bottle caps are hats. Corn, corn is corn as a potato. Hey man, you got, you got any
3215600	3222480	shoes and by shoes, I mean sleeves. Oh no, leave me alone. Everything's different.
3225040	3234080	It's 2019. Hello. This is identity door recognized opening identity door closing.
3234080	3244400	We're having recognized you. General Casey. Yes. Reporting for duty, sir. I have bad news for you.
3245920	3248960	We thought that we had mastered war, but we haven't.
3249920	3254080	It turns out we are under attack by a pancake monster.
3257760	3268160	Slowly it rises over the horizon. One, two, seven full pancakes covered in butter.
3268160	3282160	It opens its juicy mind leaks glistening syrup. It charges. Yes. Pancakes have evolved. They have
3282160	3294880	cheeks and a ma. Casey, are you okay? I'm fine. I guess if this, if this could be a 70s movie,
3294880	3304080	it could just end here, right? That's kind of a, yeah, yeah. In the 80s, then they started to
3304080	3308480	have a whole third act after that. Then you blow up the pancakes and no one cares who gives a shit.
3308480	3312480	Take your kids to it. In the 70s, you could just end there. Gene Hackman would run on a frame.
3312480	3318560	Hey you, you'd hear a gunshot credits. It's a beautiful time to be alive. Was that the,
3318560	3321920	what was that one? The taking of, tell him one, two, three. That was his French connection.
3321920	3326240	A French connection. Like he literally, like Gene Hackman was like, it's the end of the movie,
3326240	3334400	over there. And he ran off frame. And you hear credits. No spoilers possible because that's,
3334400	3340560	you know, you make up your own ending. That's the 70s. Like Omega Man, Charlton Heston is just
3340560	3344960	hanging out with zombies and they're like, oh, you're a zombie. I don't know. Well, fuck it. Good night.
3345120	3353280	God, that ghost story is so long. I could have sworn you told that before. I don't know.
3353280	3363040	I've told you before. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, no politics. No more ghost stories. No more ghost
3363040	3370160	stories. Aliens. Race. Race. We settled on a thing about race. Should we try to, should we try to
3370160	3374160	break our record? Because our record in Harmon Town shows is two black people. Do we have more than
3374160	3379360	two tonight? Okay. Oh my God. Wait, why is that white guy raising both his hands? Wait, Casey,
3380720	3383840	Casey's half a black person, half a black person. He was already up here.
3385040	3393520	Two, two and a half. Okay. There's, yeah, four, six. Holy shit. Let's get them all up here. All
3393520	3400640	black and black. All black people to the stage. Mega black. Harmon town. Mega black. Harmon town.
3400640	3405520	It's the half dozen man March. Yes.
3411680	3415520	I want all black people on the stage if possible. All right, here we are. If you're,
3415520	3419600	if you're a black person and you're in the audience right now, you are selling out your race.
3421280	3428800	Yeah. All right. So let's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and a half,
3429600	3438640	black people, everybody. All right. Come forward. Come forward. Should we have them do the, the
3438640	3444000	Rihanna chorus, the dino hook for the, oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I'll fucking, I'll spit some fire and
3444000	3449440	then, all right. Let's do that. Let me find it. You guys are joining too, but the visual, oh my God.
3450720	3453680	Hold up. Harmon town's getting more and more sophisticated.
3453680	3459440	Where the hell, oh yeah. Okay. So you want, you want to teach them a lyric? We'll do one,
3459440	3463440	those of you that know it, get in there and do it. It's a, I can't remember it. I'm so drunk. It's a,
3465040	3468400	turn that frown upside down. P is yellow.
3472160	3481520	Yo. Come on down to Harmon town, turn that frown upside down. P is yellow, poop is brown.
3481600	3489520	Come on down to Harmon town. Colors. What did they mean? Could you go from a scene to a scene? If
3489520	3496480	your skin was pale white or dark as night, would you be allowed to do a, a flying kite maneuver
3497440	3503040	over the city? I fucked your mama because I loved your juicy titty. I, I squeezed the tub,
3503040	3507920	the milk come out and the milk was white, but did that give it more clout? I don't know.
3508880	3513440	What if her milk was black? Wouldn't that give your white ass a heart attack?
3514000	3521920	Would it be worth more or worth less? What if your mama's milk was purple? Herman has come down to
3521920	3530720	Harmon town, turn that frown upside down. Race. P is yellow, poop is brown. Blackness. Come on down
3530720	3536960	to Harmon town. Struggle in the city, in the streets. Every manhole cover is another piece
3536960	3542640	of meat. I'd like to pick it up like a piece of roast beef, flip it up in the air and do it like
3543200	3550480	Keith for Sutherland. He was a famous person that loved to eat meat. Sorry, sorry.
3551840	3559840	Starting over. I fucked your mama. Mars Rover. Come on down to Harmon town. Moonwalk.
3559840	3566800	Turn that frown upside down. Race. P is yellow, poop is brown. Africa is yellow.
3568240	3574880	Huxtables. Bill Cosby. Everybody's going from Norman Lear straight to me. I'm the new
3574880	3581360	representative of their voice. Nobody black has another choice. You're not allowed to get
3581360	3587440	hired as a writer if you're black. So it comes to me. I'm like Spider-Man. I'm the Peter Parker
3587440	3592800	of the new generation. I'm going to speak for the black people of the station. Here's the things
3592800	3600880	that they like in the order of this. They like carrots and lettuce and piss. It goes like that.
3600880	3609120	Don't ask them. You got to come through me. Rap battle. Rap battle.
3617440	3622240	I totally pay for a Charmin. I don't know what I'm talking about with Ryan Elsa Charmin.
3625680	3634160	Turn that frown upside down. Race. P is yellow, poop is brown. Skin peed down. Harmon town.
3634160	3640320	Complexion. Melanin. Molecules. Little tiny things that make people ridicule each other.
3640960	3646800	Motherfucker. I'm spitting. I fucked your mama so hard. She said, I'm kidding. It's a new phrase.
3646800	3652320	It means your kids will explode. I fucked your mama so hard. I generated loads of semen
3652960	3659920	all across her chest. I fucked your mama so hard. She told me I was the best. Come on down to
3659920	3667600	Harmon town. Turn that frown upside down. Race. P is yellow, poop is brown. Urban.
3670160	3675280	Differences. Everyone is different. That's the lesson you should learn. Everyone is different.
3675920	3680880	I'm being sarcastic. Everyone's the same. It's really, really stupid that we come up with
3680880	3686160	different names. There's a class system entrenched in our culture. And the only people that profit
3686160	3691200	off of it are parasitic vultures. They sit at the top and they capitalize on us. They're a bunch
3691200	3698960	of rich motherfuckers. Fuck them. God damn it. Fuck them. Come on down to Harmon town. Turn that frown
3698960	3710720	upside down. I'm sorry. I criminalized all of you by association. I'm sorry. I disseminated
3710720	3716800	us from the nation. I'm declaring it once and for all. I'm so fucking sick and tired of all
3716800	3723120	of these fucking assholes. Suck my balls. I hope I go home and my house is burnt to the ground
3723120	3727920	because I'm a horrible person and a criminal. I got a little too drunk. I'm sorry.
3733680	3736320	Let's hear it for our nation's capitals. Black people.
3740160	3741200	They earned this.
3741200	3751600	All Arapaho Indians to the stage, please. Nope. None left. Fuck that up already.
3752640	3757120	This show could have existed 300 years ago. We could have done something.
3761840	3764960	Let's do, we should do another movie with everybody up here right now.
3765920	3771920	Really? Yeah. I thought we've got to play Dungeons and Dragons. All right.
3775120	3780000	Stay up here. All black people to play Dungeons and Dragons with us. Yeah. Let's do that. All
3780000	3785200	right. We're going to play Dungeons and Dragons with all black people tonight. There's a new
3785200	3795920	character. Right Spencer? Right. All right. I mean, is that possible? I don't know. Ask Spencer.
3795920	3799440	Is it possible to have this many people just like spring on you for the, for the D and D? I mean,
3799440	3804240	they could exist in the game world. All right. I don't have character. Are you guys down with
3804240	3813840	just standing awkwardly up on stage in the background? You can't just ask a group of people
3813840	3819520	to stand up here like just waiting to find out if they're involved. Yeah. No, we could just miss
3819520	3824960	them. I don't know. It's an awkward situation. You know what? It's metaphorical. Well, then you do it.
3824960	3830400	Let's deal with it head on. All right. What are we supposed to do? Go ahead. This is my favorite form
3830400	3845600	of affirmative action of like my whole life. This is the best. I say, Jeff, here's what I say.
3845600	3854400	We break a pool cue in half and we put it on the floor. No, sorry. That's not, that's not, that's,
3854480	3861360	that's the way we've been handling it. Let's play Dungeons and Dragons and have all black people
3862640	3866080	that want to be a part of it represent all black people in the whole nation.
3866080	3870400	All right. And they can, and they can play a character that will make up on the fly.
3870400	3875280	Okay, cool. Spencer, yeah, we'll leave it to you to include our seven and a half black people up
3875280	3880560	here. So did you say one character for all of them? No, yeah, yeah. That, I mean, yeah,
3880560	3885840	all black people have to play one character. I mean, look, we've done so much. We're bending
3885840	3895280	over backwards here. What do you want us to do? I didn't, this wasn't my problem. I inherited this.
3896800	3900400	I think I'm being pretty heroic by providing them with one D and D character.
3902160	3906000	He can be super strong. He won't be a kleptomaniac or have a stutter.
3906640	3911280	He'll be the dentist or the next door neighbor. All right, so let's start this stuff.
3912160	3914480	Aaron McGathey to the stage, please. Aaron McGathey.
3920240	3924400	Yes, yes. Yeah. Okay, here we go. Spencer.
3936000	3947040	When we last met, this is funny. Okay. You guys, yeah, I'm all good. You guys. All right.
3949600	3955680	On the last episode, our heroes had defeated Dave, the airship pilot and gained control of the ship.
3956320	3961600	After tormenting some crew members, the group had to find the engine room and enlisted the help of
3962080	3966880	through into a wall. A couple of imps who are tasked with servicing the ship's engines.
3966880	3971840	After finding some sovereign glue, the ship seemed prepared. Sharpie decided that they should press
3971840	3977440	onward and attempt to take the fight to Admiral Darkstar. It was just then that a calamitous impact
3977440	3985200	shook the entire ship before casting everything into darkness. All right. You were all knocked
3985200	3992240	unconscious. You wake up in the hole of the black ship or what's left of it at any rate. You can see
3992240	3997120	that the hole has been ripped into two halves through the wreckage. You can see dull red walls
3997120	4002640	slick with slime surrounding you. You seem to be at the bottom of a pit as above you stretches a
4002640	4010320	black expanse. Go. All right. Now, didn't we meet like some people that were going to walk us down
4010320	4016720	the road? Yeah. Okay. So like that I didn't write because I thought we'd just do it right now. But uh
4016720	4020880	okay. Do you want to just I look up and I look around and see if there's any people that will
4020880	4025520	help us down the road. You see three white figure or three white clothed figures approaching.
4028480	4032800	This isn't you. You guys are elsewhere. Seems like with a quick edit you could you could make this
4032800	4039840	very appropriate. Do what? Can't they be seven and a half black figures or seven and a half black
4039840	4049520	figures approach. Why can't it just be a full eighth black person? He said he was half black.
4049520	4057040	I'm just making a joke. Okay. He's a halfling. Seven black people and a black halfling approach.
4057040	4067760	All right. So right now you guys. That's you Casey.
4071120	4074480	Holy hell. Casey's mutated.
4078240	4083680	All right. So you guys have been living in the belly of this great beast for quite some time.
4083680	4088960	You're quite used to it but you just saw this ship crash down to the floor. It's quite a new
4088960	4094880	occurrence for you guys. I mean stowaways and shipwrecks occasionally happen but it's quite rare. So
4094880	4099280	that's your motivation as you're approaching this wreck. So our ship crashed inside the mouth of this
4099920	4104960	the infinifish. Correct and I should mention Jeff that your crystal uh I'm sorry not your crystal.
4104960	4111680	Your healing pendant shatters into a billion piles of little crystals. Whoa. That's like in a video
4111680	4116160	game because we would have been able to use that. As this happens you feel some of the crystals
4116160	4121360	dissolving healing you to full health. You see a small pile of crystals remaining. Oh I gather
4121360	4125440	those crystals. All right you gather them. Where are my hit points at right now? They're up full
4125440	4131840	now. Fuck yeah 40 hit points motherfucker. Can we get our uh can we get our character sheets? Yeah.
4131840	4138400	Thank you. All right Spencer I walk up to one of the uh uh thank you to this group of people and
4138400	4144720	I find a person that seems to be the leader and she has a red and blue feather uh a pink and blue
4144720	4150960	feather in her ear and I I I assume she's the leader so I I come up in a dresser and say uh
4150960	4156880	can you please help us? If we could help you we'd help ourselves. We're still we're stuck here.
4157520	4159680	I don't know what you want us to do. How long have you been stuck here?
4160640	4168400	Um I don't know we don't have any clocks or calendars. It's felt like years. Okay so a long
4168400	4172720	time. A very long time. I noticed that she's wearing a handmade this feels terrible vest
4172720	4180000	that I regard and think it's awesome. That's all right sorry. We do get iTunes and podcasts here
4180000	4187520	that's like the only wifi. The wifi is great. I thought I had a handle on this metaphor but it's
4187520	4199840	totally convoluted now. Well so you guys so you guys if you knew how to get out of here you
4199840	4205360	you would have gotten out of here. Hell yeah. I mean we've had tongue stew for a million years
4205360	4211520	like cutting off tongue of the the beast's mouth and making soup isn't really enjoyable. I'd rather
4211520	4216400	you know some thing else. Where did you all? Some fried chicken and watermelon.
4217840	4224000	Oh geez. Wow wow. I pick something else to look at
4226320	4228480	and I roll versus blushing.
4231280	4232080	You save.
4234880	4240880	Where did you uh black figures are they figures? They're people. They're figureheads like you and
4240880	4248080	I. They're fucking people Maureen. Uh where where are you from?
4251360	4258080	Jeez. That's right. Spencer where are they from? Where are you guys from?
4258880	4265280	From here. You were okay. They mentioned that they were actually the third generation of
4265280	4273200	people born in this fish. Oh my god the metaphor's back. I like it. So you don't know any different.
4273200	4277600	You've been born inside the belly of this savage beast. This is your ordinary world
4277600	4282960	and you have an instinctive sense that it's not a healthy place but it's all you know.
4284560	4289680	I examine our surroundings to look for exits or portals to cross through to the what I'm
4289680	4296480	gonna call south for you know sake of directionality. You see what appears to be a large. That's a
4296480	4300480	great reason to call it south. Well there's no there's no. That's actually the only reason to
4300480	4307200	call it south. I gotta draw a map you know for my reference and I can't like there's no south of a
4307200	4314480	fish but but there's down on a paper. Okay. Anyway you see a curtain it appears to be made
4314480	4320720	out of some sort of fleshy meat like substance. A meat curtain? A meat curtain. A wizard sleeve.
4324400	4329440	A portable hole. I thrust my I thrust myself headlong for the meat curtain.
4333200	4337120	I must warn you strange traveler no one who's gone to that curtain has come back.
4337120	4340080	We've lost many siblings. Are you saying? To the meat curtain.
4340080	4346000	Right. Are you saying that once you go through this particular meat curtain you never go back?
4355520	4356640	It's that what I'm hearing.
4361040	4366240	Heatless of a warning I thrust myself through the fleshy folds of the meat curtain.
4366400	4372160	You see what appears to be a snake like a pendant whip out of the curtain.
4373840	4382480	It's a dick inside a pussy. Yeah you got me. The tentacle whips at you but misses by hair.
4383680	4385280	Come on in guys it's okay.
4385280	4396400	I approach the whipping serpent and I whip my hair around in an attempt to calm it down
4396400	4398320	or maybe to just make it straighter.
4402320	4408480	The curtain opens. Three more tendrils reveal themselves. She's a busy lady.
4408720	4420480	They also miss. Are we armed? You guys are actually armed with daggers and spears. Sorry you guys.
4420480	4427680	Spencer. It's not his fault. Spears are gonna be really useful as you'll see later.
4429280	4436400	I can't do anything. All right. Guys you've been here for three generations. If we don't go through
4436400	4441120	this meat curtain together we've got no chance of getting out. I say follow me with your spears
4441120	4449360	and daggers. I say we sent one of the black people in first. Is that cool? You already went in first.
4449360	4454480	Oh that's right. I'm already in there. Before they go in I shoot one arrow.
4454480	4471440	No. Sorry? More. I shoot 14 arrows. Or two. One of the arrows strikes the meat curtain.
4471440	4482080	It shutters violently. Am I sorry? Are we all through the curtain right now? No one's even
4482080	4490320	tried to go through it. Everybody let's all charge. Charge the meat curtain. I peek cautiously
4490320	4495360	through the meat curtain. You guys you guys want to go through?
4499600	4503360	I lead my army of black people through the meat curtain. Yes.
4503360	4512000	Failing to regard. We thrust our daggers and spears. Our non-denominational daggers and spears
4512880	4517600	through the meat curtain towards the tentacles. Brandishing your weapons dangerously you charge
4517600	4522320	through the curtain. The tentacles whip back and forth but you manage to subdue them and make it
4522320	4534240	through. Black adventure! Adventure! Sorry guys. Mixed reaction. So we're beyond the tentacles now?
4534800	4541040	You are beyond the tentacles. What do we see? You see a blue round tunnel. It seems to get smaller
4541040	4551520	and smaller. I've tried to summon squirrels but there's no squirrels inside the infinite fish.
4551520	4557600	I've already tried that. Black friends, is there a way to take the spears and to prop them up so
4557600	4566960	as to keep the blue tunnel wide? Like, sorry? I need to stop listening to people yelling. The
4566960	4571520	spears. Can you take your spears and just like stick them up right so the tunnel can't close?
4572560	4579840	Well we have we have her strange legend of an exit which if stimulated properly expands.
4580640	4585840	Excellent. Excellent. Exit this beast but none have ventured this far previously.
4588400	4589120	Oh my god.
4594400	4600080	I'm having way too much fun. There's a legend of a thing that expands when you stimulate it.
4600080	4608560	Uh yeah well that sounds that sounds like. What is your secret uh wise woman uh to to stimulate
4608560	4622640	the the tunnel to make it expand? Uh my uh a wise African-American elder as uh as African-American
4622640	4629920	elders tend to be very wise uh once told me of a sacred dance that can only be performed when you
4629920	4640560	have a uh seven and a half seven and a half African dark-skinned beings and uh three pale
4640560	4647440	skinned people can only uh create this dance to uh arouse the exit. So we all you're saying we
4647440	4653200	all have to dance together to coax the opening to uh to to widen for us to pass through?
4653200	4656240	Si señor. Can you? Wait wait. Si señor?
4657920	4664880	The the three of us have have only danced in the shape of square. Can you show us how to dance?
4668640	4672960	Sometimes in a line uh when things get hotter than a hoochie coochie.
4672960	4684880	If thou'st has a beat to drop we may proceed. Are you there? I'm getting very uncomfortable.
4687520	4693520	No we're we're black so it's okay. That's what's making me that's the whole. I can talk like this.
4695040	4697120	I do not want to see the TMZ headline.
4697120	4704000	Uh I feel comfortable. I'll lead the charge.
4706000	4711280	Wearing a. No I think it. Oh this will actually be embarrassing.
4717120	4724560	Open up. Open up. Die late. Open up. Gotta open up that esophagus. I'm gonna
4724560	4729040	fuck your mama like I was Snuffleupagus. Gonna take my trunk. It's not imaginary.
4729040	4734160	I'm gonna fuck your mama like an aviary. Bird to bird. Feather to feather. Gonna fuck your
4734160	4739680	mom like my name was Carl Weathers. Gonna fuck her dick. Fuck her butt mother. Fuck her salted
4739680	4744560	ass peanuts. I'm gonna fuck her cashew. Fuck her almond. Gonna fuck her name like my name
4744560	4749440	was Philip Drummond. Fuck her like a different stroke. I'm gonna fuck your mama like my dick
4749440	4754480	was a joke. You gotta set up on my nuts. Gotta punch one on my tip. Fuck your mama. That's how
4754480	4767680	I'm hip. And then I assume that's like an open sesame. The rhythmic pounding of feet and limbs
4767680	4773760	and the flailing of your bodies seems to do nothing at first but then you feel the expanding
4773760	4782400	and contracting muscular action. Jesus. The esophageal tube opens and widens revealing a
4782400	4789760	larger antechamber. So we're going down the throat into the belly of this infinifish. You're going
4789760	4798880	down an esophageal tube. It may or may not be a throat. It opens into a large chamber. Dungeon
4798880	4807520	snap. Dungeon snap. You can see several wooden constructions built together. They seem to have
4807520	4813840	been made out of parts of old ships or perhaps other crates and boxes but they hold together
4813840	4821840	quite nicely. There seems to be about 16 or 17 of the dwellings. This is where you guys have lived.
4821840	4829520	Your parents you know they came I guess I said third generation so your parents came on ships
4829520	4835440	and they built these into a village. So that's where you guys live. Wait so they they've lived
4835440	4842480	here? Yeah well yeah. Have they been here before? They they've lived here for three generations. Yeah
4842480	4847600	but they usually take a different path. A less dangerous. Oh so we just took the long hard way
4847600	4852400	to get here? Yeah. That's just like the corner drugstore. They could have told us how to get home
4853280	4858160	and is that is that your doorbell? We all do a dance and that's how you get home? You guys saw
4858160	4862080	the meat there. We incorporate new people into our culture. We like to embarrass them first.
4862080	4868560	Okay that makes sense. We shouldn't have to have TV. They don't have TV. Just wi-fi. So now we're
4868560	4873840	now we're at the home of these people. Yeah this is this is your guy's home. You love it.
4874560	4880080	Once you feng shui the organs. No that's someone else's joke. Sorry guys.
4882960	4888400	It's beautiful here. It's great here guys. It's nice. I've never seen such a nice place inside
4888400	4896800	of enough saffageal tube before. I love what you've done with the the throat. We try. We try. We get
4896800	4902720	Martha Stewart living on the wi-fi so we try to make it cozy. You've really started from a place
4902720	4908960	of nothing and built from the scraps of a you know and created something that's that's that's
4908960	4915360	equally appealing and a testament to the environment that is this uh uh infinifish. You could even say
4915360	4922720	we found love in a hopeless place. Yeah it seems like like like you did not land on this infinifish.
4922720	4924720	It seems like this infinifish landed on you.
4929920	4937040	But I respect what you've done. I think we can learn from it. Like I I all I pull Mulrain aside
4937040	4943440	over to uh the the wall of the saffageal tube and I say Mulrain I don't know if you're watching this
4943440	4948400	but it seems there's some sort of spark of connection between this leader and and Sharpie
4948400	4954320	whom you've been in love with. Are you you better I warn you be careful. I know about these
4954320	4962640	a saffageal people. Yes uh Quirk I I saw it too but I I can't move like she can move.
4964240	4971920	I can shoot arrows and I can wave my hair and I can giggle but um you know I I'm going to uh
4971920	4981600	concede. Don't tell him that I your talent for passive aggression seduces me.
4985120	4990480	It wasn't passive aggression you couldn't hear me. Oh well I heard the sound of someone needing
4990480	4997280	more than than uh you know. Are we going to talk about our our actual relationship in the middle
4997360	5003680	of D&D. I was just expressing that I was sad. It wasn't being passive aggressive. It was similar
5003680	5008400	to the van thing last night. I take I take our new hosts out to to lunch at their local
5008400	5012560	esophagus shack while these two sort out their relationship from the tour bus today.
5013840	5019040	Yeah all right all right so we're at the we're at the we're at the village of these people who
5019040	5024240	who have a weird habit of making people go through a tentacle uh esophagus in order to get
5024240	5032240	where they already lived. I mean we we can't do much more than that. We we've done this for like
5032240	5036240	a half hour. We should probably cut it off there. It's fine. Avoid our issues. It's fine.
5038480	5043760	Let's hear it for America's black people. The Capitol Steps.
5047440	5051280	I'm gonna give them a name Jeff. The Capitol Steps. All right wait what's the first name real
5051280	5055280	quick before you go off. We got Casey. All right. Just for the sake of credits.
5058720	5066160	Casey. Casey you are Latiah. Latiah. Nice to meet you. Tori. Tori nice to meet you soon.
5067360	5073360	I met you earlier at the bar. Welcome again. Vanessa. Vanessa. Aliyah. Aliyah.
5073680	5081920	Philip. Philip. Andrew. Andrew. Thank you so much for coming up. Black people!
5084800	5093280	Our salvation. There's nothing left. We have nothing left. We have nothing left. I when we
5093280	5099200	were in uh when we were near Boston in Summerville I had a camper come up as up to stage because I
5099200	5109680	was a camp counselor. I have another camper here. Show off. Just saying. You want to bring her up.
5109680	5120160	I'd like to. Let's get her up. All right. Alex. Sounds white but fine. Change of pace.
5121440	5125680	You said you were you were asking for something. Now you're being. I wanted it. I wanted to hear
5125920	5132480	Alex Fox. You wanted to hear about it. Oh Alex Fox. So Alex when we were in Summerville
5132480	5136880	Massachusetts we had another one of Erin's campers come up and we talked about feminine
5136880	5144560	wetness and uh and then her mother came on stage and she got bananas. It got weird. Did
5144560	5149760	Erin dispense any uncomfortable wisdom to you while you were at the camp? I mean Erin was just
5149760	5157440	really my sexual education like up until I was about like what 14, 15. I went to a really strict
5157440	5163440	school, private Catholic school, so I didn't know what sex was and Erin really was really eager to
5163440	5169840	talk about it with just our our 14-year-old selves. That's not why I brought her up. No but. Did she ever
5169840	5177040	make you pass through her flesh curtains? No but she did show me my first penis so like. Wait what?
5177680	5180000	No I'm just kidding you don't have a penis. I'm just kidding.
5182480	5184640	You're totally fine. You're normal.
5186560	5190720	It would also be okay if I had a penis. No totally. It would be fine. That would be
5190720	5196160	even more educating like but sorry. Women having penises is the new black. It's true.
5197200	5201520	What we did tonight was kind of antiquated like we're not really breaking down any barriers. This
5201520	5207440	is DC like we should we should have had transgender people up here. Yeah. Black people yawn.
5209600	5211040	What is this Gilligan's Island?
5214480	5215760	Issue solved.
5220800	5227280	Well thank. So Alex you were counseled by Erin when you were younger.
5227280	5234320	And now we're all grown up but Dan and Erin were about to talk about a little spat they had today
5234320	5238240	which I know nothing about. Maybe you could counsel them right now through this. Maybe you could
5238240	5243440	you get to kind of mediate through through this crisis. Yeah but I'd like to hear about it.
5243440	5249760	Alex why don't you take the take the mic and walk them through. Hey Alex Fox so we were in
5249760	5254000	Summerville and then after the show I was talking to some fans. This is Dan's side of the story.
5254480	5261120	I was I was I was talking to two fans about glassblowing. Very interesting.
5262480	5267680	Providence last night. Oh I'm sorry yes yes sorry. I'm starting to be yeah it's all it's all the same.
5268880	5270720	Only the names have changed.
5273520	5277440	I was in Rhode Island talking to two guys about glassblowing. Signing on autographs.
5278320	5284400	You know foregoing the opportunity to write a TV show. It was like having decided okay this is
5284400	5290800	where I need to be. Right. Being a hero really. Right of course. My girlfriend comes up to me
5290800	5299280	and she says hey you know the van's leaving. I don't know if you wanted to go or if you don't
5299280	5304800	want to go but the van's leaving. Dan's side of the story. And the van is the only mode of
5304800	5310080	transportation. All right. Oh I guess I'll stay. Is everyone leaving. I don't know if everyone's
5310080	5314160	leaving. There's two vans but there's another van leaving later. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't
5314160	5319280	know. And what follows is a 25 minute conversation about when the van's leaving when the vans aren't
5319280	5325760	leaving. But I know the whole time because I'm 40. I know the whole time that what she's saying
5325760	5333680	without saying it is she wants to leave. She wants me to want to leave but she's not saying
5334400	5341040	I want you to want to leave. She's saying everything else. And I'm agreeing with it because
5341040	5346080	I don't give a shit. And I'm going like okay well you know if you want to take what you're saying
5346080	5349600	at face value if you want to get on the first van get on the first van second van. I don't know.
5349600	5356960	25 minutes goes by by my drunk estimation. And she kind of at one point she walks away and goes
5356960	5360960	like well I'm gonna get on the first van. She walks away goodbye. I'll see you back at the hotel.
5361920	5367840	Then she comes back and because there is no van and there's no there is nothing. And she goes like
5367840	5372320	well the van is that there's another van of the van van van van van and schedule van van van
5372320	5376880	schedule. And I go again I don't care. I'm talking to guys about glass blowing. I don't care.
5376880	5382000	She she she she walks away. And you and you love glass blowing. Well I did that night. I never
5382000	5385840	heard anything about it. It's fucking fascinating. Like really think about it. Like my first question
5385840	5390000	was do you just take a bunch of sand and heat it up. Does it turn into glass. The answer is no Jeff.
5391520	5395360	The answer is no. Dan my van is leaving in a couple seconds.
5396320	5400400	I already know everything about about this. I don't know. This is my one chance. I'm talking to
5400400	5407120	some dudes about blowing glass. And so so then so then what happened. The thing that really
5407120	5414240	causes the fight pops the champagne cork on the beautiful frothy anger bottle that is our
5414240	5422880	relationship is is the tour manager the guy whose job it is to tell you when and a van is
5422880	5428400	coming and when it isn't comes up to me and says hey Dan so there's a van leaving now and there's
5428400	5432640	a van leaving in 15 minutes. Which one do you want to be on. And I go I'll take the one in 15
5432640	5436560	minutes. He goes OK. And he proceeds to go around the bar and tell everybody. And when I see him
5436560	5442960	telling it to Aaron I started I was drunk and I was an asshole. I was going huh huh huh. I was
5443040	5446960	like jiggling my ear and she and she's like looking at me going what are you doing. And
5446960	5451680	she came over to me and I said I'm just saying do you hear how that works. You hear you hear
5451680	5459360	you hear how easy that is. That's rude. Yeah. Well fuck you guys. I I I I I I I lost
5459360	5464960	38 minutes of glass blowing talk. All right. She has a little bit of dignity for 30 seconds.
5464960	5470800	I'll try to make my version a little shorter. I thought it wasn't a dis. But I think that is
5471760	5479840	you can afford to time stealer. The 38 minutes. You're just a Timberlake arm readout has fucking
5479840	5486720	100 of my minutes on it from just because I spent all that time talking about vans instead
5486720	5492320	of fucking glass. I would have been I would have been up here tonight teaching motherfuckers how
5492320	5498880	to blow a bottle out of dirt. There's crucial shit I missed. All I know is that is that we're
5498880	5503440	fighting Alex. Alex jump in mediate for fuck's sake. What's going on. Let's hear her side.
5503440	5509040	Let's hear her side of the story. There you go. First of all there's those guys talking to Dan
5509040	5514400	about blowing glass. Super cool. Learned a lot from him. I was also listening to them about glass
5514400	5519920	and like the lightning striking the sand and that making like these big branches of glass and things.
5519920	5526560	It was cool. I also had a great time at the bar. I was tired. Neil Berkeley who's directing the
5526560	5529920	documentary was like you know we're going to we're going to get in the van and go. Sometimes
5529920	5534880	like transportation has been tough and people have been left behind. So I was like oh well
5534880	5539280	I'm going to let Dan know that I'm going to go. Maybe he'll want to go to. I love him. Love him
5539280	5543600	dearly. Went up to him. I was like hey like there's there's going to be a van going in a little
5543600	5548080	bit if you want to get on that van. And he responded to me in a way that made me think that
5548080	5552720	he was like oh okay I'll get on the van. If you want me to get on the van. Like I had said
5552800	5559040	hey we're getting on a van. So if you want to be cool get on the van. And he responded to me like
5559040	5563840	I had said it that way. So I was like well that didn't feel good. And I walked away
5564560	5570240	and because I can't walk away from things I was like oh no that's that was rude. And I walked
5570240	5574960	back and I tried to explain it to him and he he was very like snippy with me. And then I walked
5574960	5578480	back and was talking to more people and that was when the tour manager went over and told him about
5578480	5584080	the 15 minutes thing. I didn't know it but then afterwards he you know he did this and then he
5584080	5588560	yelled at me and then I went back to the hotel room and I was crying in the bathroom
5589360	5591840	and he came in and he's like you're taking a shit.
5594800	5597840	I don't know I can't see tears. All I see is a closed bathroom door.
5598320	5610560	And I walked I walked out my my face is is red and I said I like what because I was sitting there
5610560	5615120	crying and I was like you know I'm I feel like I'm constantly that whole fight happened because
5615120	5620320	I was worried he was going to get left behind because call back to the mom issues from earlier.
5620320	5626080	Sometimes I'm Dan's mom a little bit. I get his food together. I take care of him as best I can.
5626720	5628240	What? That's normal.
5630160	5637200	Good job Casey. Alex. Casey. No I know I met the guy from earlier. I just thought that guy
5637200	5642880	earlier he was fucking great. But yeah he checked his arms and his sleeves and the costume design
5642880	5649760	alone. Sorry Alex go ahead. So yeah so it escalated it escalated from there and Dan
5650720	5657600	Dan tore me a real good one and I was crying for a long time. He left the hotel room. He ran into
5657600	5664400	Bobcat Goldthwaite in the Goldwaite. Goldthwaite. Sorry. Bob Goldthwaite was in the room across the
5664400	5669360	hall. So he leaves he talks to him and then he comes back and he's he's calmed down and he said
5669360	5677360	I'm sorry because he said a lot of mean things to me including the C word. That's
5678160	5686400	never okay. Which C word? Cutie. Yeah it's not so bad. So yeah and then this morning I was still
5686400	5689760	bummed out about it even though he said I'm sorry but he said a lot of really
5690880	5696960	really cruel things to me. It made me feel pretty worthless. Okay Alex now you can have a chance to
5696960	5702320	graduate. All right well here's my thing if you apologized to her then you're admitting that you
5702320	5706400	did something wrong you're at least realizing that you hurt her feelings in some capacity.
5706720	5712080	So then I mean I think it was mostly a miscommunication between the two of you. You
5712080	5716160	thought she was harassing you to get on this van. Right. When in reality she was just concerned
5716160	5720800	about not leaving you behind. Maybe. I should say the crux of this argument. All good intentions you
5720800	5725520	know so I don't think. He thought I was lying. He thought that I was bullshitting him and I was not
5725520	5729760	and I stand by him. Because it's a silly thing to lie about and I don't think Erin would do that
5729760	5735200	personally however. Well have you dated her for a year? No I haven't you're right so I don't know.
5735200	5740160	So I'm just saying from an unbiased perspective however you know clearly her heart was in the
5740160	5744640	right place if she's saying that she thinks she was going to leave you behind and you admitted
5744640	5750320	that you were wrong about something. So by applause should they break up or stay together?
5751280	5757680	Stay together. That's my vote. Thank you Alex that was very wise that was lovely.
5758720	5763680	I mean we're staying together no matter what. We're staying together no matter what. That's the
5763680	5771120	problem. Like like like we're. Yes. I'm not I'm never gonna leave her and if she leaves me I'll
5771120	5778720	kill myself. Sounds very healthy. There begin the problems when you realize that you can't be
5778720	5785040	without someone then you go like all right what the fuck are you doing? Why are you uh yeah why.
5785040	5789040	So maybe if that's true instead of thinking that I'm someone who could never go away.
5789760	5795040	Think of me as someone who you want to take care of and be nice to because I'm never going to go
5795040	5801920	away. You don't want this this perfect flower that you have to wilt. You want to nourish this flower.
5801920	5806400	Now let's first of all thank Alex for coming up and dispensing but I think it's very sound
5807600	5814160	sound counseling. Thank you. Let's see if we can sum this up. Maybe we can heal these wounds
5814160	5816240	via our new anthem. Let's try this one out.
5819040	5827440	It's been a good night in Arlington. Let's learn some things. Oh yeah.
5830000	5831360	I told a pretty long story.
5834000	5839680	Everybody does something wrong but I'm gonna heal you with a tender song.
5840480	5850080	I'm so sorry to Aaron and Jeff and Spencer and all the black people. I didn't mean to do you bad.
5850800	5856640	I just want to make you happy not sad. I just want to go from town to town and say
5856640	5868000	Harman town where pee is yellow and poop is brown. Harman town. Everybody's singing Harman town
5868000	5874800	where pee is yellow and the poop is brown. I like the bread and the butter and the honey and
5874800	5880880	the nutrients grow on every tree and the leaves go to the sky and drip down on me
5880880	5888880	and every piece of sustenance makes me feel young and free again and I feel like I'm 20 again.
5888880	5896320	I fucked your mama so hard that I I swear I saw her in a prison yard and I'm sorry that she got
5896320	5903840	fucked with my fleshy shard of love. Flushy shard of love. I don't think the glove fits the hand
5903840	5909600	in the quitting process. I'm sorry I got thrown off the rail. I'm sorry I'm gonna start over again.
