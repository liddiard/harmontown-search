0	23760	Hello, winning off a beautiful uptown Burbank Harman town is now in session.
23760	28000	Hello gang, please welcome to the stage the Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.
28000	43000	And the mayor of Shafaw Fair, the mayor of Harman town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
43000	44000	Thank you.
44000	45000	Thanks.
45000	46000	Hello, Dan.
46000	47000	Hi.
47000	48000	You're looking good.
48000	51000	I told you backstage, but I'm going to say it again.
51000	52000	You're looking good.
52000	53000	Oh, thank you.
53000	55000	I'm wearing a head-to-toe bomb fell.
55000	57000	They're a sponsor.
57000	58000	Really?
58000	59000	Clothes from the male.
59000	61000	For the male.
61000	63000	They don't have women's clothes.
63000	65000	It's not controversial.
65000	67000	You can wear them if you're women.
67000	68000	I'm assuming.
68000	69000	I wouldn't stop you.
69000	72000	It's not gentle.
72000	78000	I got no beef with women dressed like guys.
78000	82000	I applaud them, especially in the shoe department.
82000	83000	I don't like high-heeled shoes.
83000	86000	I find myself distracted by high-heeled shoes.
86000	88000	I worry about the woman's comfort.
88000	90000	It's not because I'm a good person.
90000	91000	I just worry about it.
91000	96000	I was in a little bit of a bad mood last week.
96000	100000	The reason why you said, were you guys here for the show last week?
100000	104000	Even if they were, they have to pretend they weren't because I told them I hated them.
104000	110000	So if they admit that they were here in the back, they have to admit to low self-esteem.
111000	114000	As somebody who's at the show live, obviously,
114000	117000	it's a different experience to watch it than to hear it.
117000	122000	But I heard that one, and I can imagine what it was like there.
122000	127000	You seem a little grumpy that last show.
127000	129000	Was there anything particular that happened,
129000	134000	or were you just in one of those moods that happens because the world is a crazy place right now?
134000	138000	There are several theories.
139000	142000	A lot of people go with Occam's razor.
142000	145000	No pun intended, and they think it's the mustache.
145000	148000	They think the mustache has changed me.
148000	150000	But I think it's Twitter withdrawal.
150000	153000	I was talking to my therapist about it.
153000	156000	I had a similar thing during the divorce.
156000	164000	It was through no fault of Aaron's and of no statement about the marriage at all.
164000	166000	Because my therapist warned me,
166000	168000	it doesn't matter when you divorce,
168000	170000	one thing that you should be aware of,
170000	174000	you're going to find yourself hyper-vigilant about injustice.
174000	176000	I've talked about this in the podcast.
176000	179000	I was like, well, okay, I'll keep an eye on that.
179000	187000	Then cut to me, just sending these insane text messages to the guy who cleans my fish tank.
187000	195000	When you read them, I'm accusing him of making my life into an Edward Albee play.
195000	198000	I'm like, this is some Virginia Woolf shit.
198000	201000	You need to tell me how to work this light.
201000	203000	It was crazy.
203000	209000	It was erratic behavior because there was a detachment.
209000	212000	Twitter, we don't want to admit, or I don't want to admit.
212000	213000	I'll speak for myself.
213000	216000	I'm sure a lot of healthy people are using Twitter very healthily.
216000	220000	As you probably know, I was really fixated on it.
220000	223000	So I quit it for a little bit.
223000	229000	Did you stop having that outlet for that justice stuff?
229000	232000	Yes, I find myself snapping particularly.
232000	236000	But now it's about the world.
236000	238000	I'm scaring my burps.
238000	240000	But fuck you, I don't care what you think.
240000	242000	Whoa, whoa!
242000	244000	He loves you guys.
244000	246000	He just doesn't know how to say it.
246000	251000	The delivery guy from Boo's Philly Cheesesteak didn't bring both raspberry iced tea snapples.
251000	256000	I just went all Patty Chayefsky about it.
256000	261000	I just fucking, like, Robert Duvald out.
261000	263000	Only to Cody, though.
263000	270000	And because Cody is, like, the amazing thing is there's, like, a scientific experiment here where you can say, Dan, are you crazy?
270000	273000	Do you...
273000	277000	It's like, oh, maybe we could test it if you had, like, let's say a perfect girlfriend.
277000	279000	Or let's not say, you know, perfection doesn't...
279000	281000	We don't look for perfect people.
281000	282000	We don't want to be with perfect people.
282000	291000	But I'm saying, like, a relationship which there's nothing on the Wheel of Fortune credit, like...
291000	294000	What a metaphor.
294000	296000	Wasn't there a sign, like, Wheel of Fortune?
296000	298000	That was my favorite thing about the last week's show.
298000	301000	And Eddie Pepperton said, that metaphor didn't work.
301000	303000	And it was like, Eddie, don't.
303000	305000	No, Eddie, you're not allowed to...
305000	309000	But Pepperton goes, wait, you can say that?
309000	311000	We could just say that metaphor doesn't scan?
311000	313000	No, no, you cannot.
313000	316000	Not if you want the family to stay together.
316000	322000	That's like, no, no, we don't talk about dad's drinking or his metaphors.
322000	329000	I mean, if you want to move forward and have tumult, but it could end up with you sitting at your uncle's place for a while.
329000	331000	Try to fix the Wheel of Fortune thing you were talking about.
331000	340000	Well, I was just like, in Wheel of Fortune, they would spin the wheel, and then sometimes they would put something on a count or something.
340000	342000	They would say, can I put that on a count?
342000	344000	And then Pat Sajak would say, yeah.
344000	346000	And then I'd go, what the fuck was that?
346000	350000	And then they'd just keep spinning, and then they'd say, I don't know what the hell it was.
350000	351000	They would put shit on a count.
351000	356000	I'm telling you, it was like an old-dimey grocery store, like in a Coen Brothers movie.
356000	357000	I don't remember that at all.
357000	359000	I haven't watched that show in 30 years.
359000	360000	I just had some shit on a count back there.
360000	362000	I'm looking it up later.
362000	363000	You know what?
363000	364000	I'll do it right now.
364000	365000	No.
365000	366000	So anyways.
366000	367000	You know what's crazy?
367000	368000	I saw the wheel.
368000	369000	That wheel's tiny.
369000	371000	It seems huge.
371000	374000	The wheel's like, it's this big.
374000	382000	Well, you know, this goes with Sajak's, what Sajak said on Letterman back in the 80s when the Wheel of Fortune, the country had Wheel of Fortune media.
382000	387000	Some other things that we fell in love with for like two weeks was like Australia for a while.
388000	390000	There were like eight movies about a guy named Crocodile Dundee.
390000	393000	And then because it was the only Australian we could find that was like famous.
393000	398000	Then we tried something with a guy named Yahoo Serious and everything just collapsed like Enron.
398000	401000	It was like, wait, you're selling something that doesn't exist now.
401000	403000	That's just a big desert.
403000	404000	There's no famous people down there.
404000	408000	We live in a Yahoo Serious and Jaco-based economy.
408000	409000	Jaco, yeah.
409000	415000	There was a guy in Duracell commercials whose catchphrase and soul phrase was oi.
415000	416000	That's all he said.
417000	418000	He'd say oi.
418000	423000	And then you'd be at a battery store and you'd go, oh, Energizer, oi.
424000	428000	There was an eight year scare where barbecues were Barbies.
428000	429000	But yeah.
429000	431000	Foster's is Australia for a beer.
431000	432000	All that stuff.
432000	435000	I think Foster's kind of snuck in on that wave and hung out.
435000	436000	That's the one thing.
436000	438000	But they don't even drink that in Australia.
438000	439000	That's bullshit.
440000	441000	What are you telling me?
441000	443000	And they don't call them shrimps.
443000	445000	They call them prawns.
445000	446000	Look.
448000	452000	So the delivery guy brings one raspberry iced tea snapple.
454000	455000	I didn't know.
455000	458000	I thought that that meant I thought because I knew I ordered one.
458000	460000	I didn't know Cody ordered one.
460000	462000	Get your shit together.
462000	464000	You tell the audience you hate them more.
464000	466000	You can't even speak English.
466000	467000	Speak English.
467000	469000	Get out of the country.
471000	473000	You ever notice all those guys, they can't speak English.
474000	475000	They can't spell.
475000	476000	The Republicans.
476000	477000	I mean, whatever.
479000	482000	They have no mastery of their mother tongue.
482000	484000	And they're like yelling at immigrants.
484000	488000	The immigrants are like, I had to learn like eight presidents just to trim your bush.
488000	490000	This fucking sucks.
490000	491000	One of them's bush.
491000	493000	That's my mnemonic device.
495000	496000	Two of them are bush.
496000	498000	That's, you know, that's why.
498000	502000	And then you guys raised it to nine presidents because you said that was too easy.
504000	505000	It was almost too Clinton.
505000	506000	It was almost almost.
506000	510000	And then we had an influx of unqualified bush trimmers.
513000	514000	It's an apple.
514000	515000	Snapple.
515000	516000	And so I start going on.
516000	518000	I was happy all day.
518000	520000	And then I go get the food.
520000	522000	I'm with my perfect girlfriend.
522000	525000	I come back up with the paper bag.
525000	529000	You can already see the dark spots on the bottom so you know it's going to be good.
530000	532000	It's coming through the bag.
532000	534000	My dogs are freaking out.
535000	537000	I think there might be a dead skunk in that bag.
537000	539000	No, it's Philly cheesesteaks.
539000	541000	And I take them out.
541000	542000	One raspberry snapple.
542000	543000	That's how much we ordered.
543000	545000	Cody says, there's not two iced tea raspberry snapples?
545000	546000	No.
546000	547000	What?
547000	548000	Did they?
548000	549000	Did they?
549000	550000	Are you fucking kidding me?
550000	551000	God damn it.
551000	553000	What is with this fucking world?
553000	559000	And I just talked for 20 minutes at the top of my voice and that would be charming.
559000	562000	But here's something that I do.
562000	570000	I kept saying because this is how desperate I was to abuse.
570000	571000	That I couldn't just share.
571000	575960	I couldn't at least just be in a bad mood and share it with my partner.
575960	579160	So I just kept saying but I had nothing to bitch at Cody about.
579160	585280	I was just tabulating all the injustices that had happened to me that week.
585280	588640	And because Cody hadn't done anything wrong.
588640	594640	I just kept saying, this guy does this to me, this guy, what is with you people?
594640	597640	I just kept saying you people to Cody.
597640	600640	You people being the human race.
600640	603640	You know all of you.
603640	604640	You eat billion of you.
604640	608640	You're just always conspiring to fuck with me.
608640	610640	And then she was like, okay, cool.
610640	615640	And then we watched the rest of Grumlins 2 or whatever the hell.
615640	618640	Every once in a while you got to just go check back and check it out.
618640	621640	Was Hulk Hogan in that?
621640	623640	Is it good?
623640	626640	Was Grumlins 2 worth a rewatch?
626640	627640	It's worth a rewatch.
627640	629640	I don't know about your first question.
629640	630640	I don't know.
630640	631640	Is anything good?
631640	632640	I don't know.
632640	634640	It wasn't Citizen Kane.
634640	636640	It wasn't even the Citizen Kane of Grumlin movies.
636640	638640	The Grumlins got really specific.
638640	639640	Let me ask you this.
639640	641640	When was the last time you watched the first Grumlins?
641640	644640	Because I told Cody, I was like, you got to watch Grumlins 2.
644640	645640	She's like, what to?
645640	647640	I'm like, Jesus, I'm really robbing the cradle.
647640	651640	And I'm like, well, Grumlins 2.
651640	653640	She's like, I ain't seen no Grumlins 1.
653640	654640	And I was like, okay, well, great.
654640	656640	So we'll start with this holiday classic.
656640	659640	But then you got to see Grumlins 2.
659640	661640	So I put in Grumlins 1, five minutes in.
661640	663640	I'm like, what the shit and fuck?
663640	665640	This movie is garbage.
665640	667640	It is amazing.
667640	670640	We have a serious problem in this society.
670640	675640	And the thermometer for our sickness is Rotten Tomatoes.
675640	682640	It's just like any movie that had some claim on the box office pulse
682640	685640	when a certain demographic was 10 years old,
685640	688640	it just automatically is way above a 70%.
688640	690640	And it's just garbage nostalgia.
690640	692640	There's no comparing this shit.
692640	693640	What is it?
693640	695640	Solar babies, 98%.
695640	698640	Because people are like, man, solar babies, man.
698640	699640	Custody weekend.
699640	700640	It was great.
700640	703640	Does Solar Babies really have a 90 year old?
703640	704640	No.
704640	705640	I can't think of any examples.
705640	706640	That was amazing.
706640	707640	But then you watch something.
707640	709640	I know I've talked about this.
709640	710640	Lockout.
710640	711640	Come on.
711640	712640	It's die hard in space.
712640	713640	It's great.
713640	715640	It has like a 20% or something.
715640	716640	It's ridiculous.
716640	718640	They worked hard on that movie.
718640	719640	It's good.
719640	722640	Was it called lockout?
722640	723640	Yeah.
723640	724640	I don't know lockout.
724640	725640	Yeah.
725640	726640	That's a crime.
726640	727640	I know.
727640	728640	And tomorrow is...
728640	729640	Charts from a lockout.
729640	730640	We're watching a lockout.
730640	731640	Anyways.
731640	734640	There's a lot of movies with 80% of Rotten Tomatoes.
734640	735640	They're just crap.
735640	738640	And it's just people, they're just like,
738640	741640	I will defend my legacy.
741640	743640	You've got to go back and watch it.
743640	746640	If you can't look into your soul, gentlemen,
746640	750640	at least rewatch some of these pieces of shit.
750640	751640	You're nostalgic.
751640	753640	Just stop pretending that it makes it a good movie,
753640	754640	that you liked it.
754640	759640	You were a tiny, a little itty-bitty, little dummy.
759640	760640	Almost said...
760640	764640	I almost said the R word.
764640	766640	That last sentence, if you rewind it,
766640	769640	you're like, yeah, it seems like Dan's getting a little less...
769640	772640	His famous articulate charm.
772640	774640	Because I was just the whole time.
774640	776640	I was like, aha, my sister's retarded.
776640	777640	Okay.
777640	779640	But now you can just use...
779640	780640	Dothard.
780640	781640	Dothard.
781640	782640	Wait, what's...
782640	785640	Kim Jong-un went 14th century on Trump and called him a dothard.
785640	786640	Oh, a dothard, yeah.
786640	788640	And everybody was like, what's a dothard?
788640	790640	I mean, I saw that, not on Twitter.
790640	792640	A dothard is a great word.
792640	795640	Look, I've got to be honest.
795640	797640	Point one for fucking Kim Jong-un.
797640	798640	That's fucking...
798640	801640	Well, again, these guys have to learn English in schools.
801640	802640	He didn't.
802640	805640	Is there a Korean word for dothard?
805640	808640	Did somebody translate that and go,
808640	811640	well, he's talking about a senile bewildered old fucker.
812640	815640	In Korean, we have a word for that.
815640	818640	But the closest I can get in English is dothard,
818640	821640	which no one has used since Jane Austen.
822640	823640	But that's fucking good.
823640	824640	So fucking, yeah.
824640	828640	I like Kim Jong-un a little bit more than our president.
830640	835640	Because either he paid a little more attention in English class
835640	838640	or he just listens to some of his advisers.
839640	841640	Also, his haircut.
841640	843640	He's one guitar away from being the lead singer
843640	845640	of a very successful Rocket Billy band.
846640	847640	He looks amazing.
847640	849640	I wish he'd go gray, but only in the middle.
849640	850640	Yeah.
850640	851640	No, he'd be fucking Brian Setzer.
851640	853640	He'd be fucking sexy as shit.
853640	855640	That would be incredible.
855640	856640	He would...
856640	857640	Yeah.
857640	858640	Okay.
858640	860640	Anyways, he's almost like...
860640	863640	You know what he's going to start looking like in his old age?
863640	864640	Kim Jong-un?
864640	868640	Yeah, he's going to look like a Korean Steve Van Sant
868640	870640	from The Sopranos.
872640	873640	Whatever that character...
873640	874640	Not Pauli Wollin.
874640	875640	That's the other guy.
875640	876640	What was it?
876640	877640	Joey Bag of Tits.
877640	878640	Yeah, whatever.
881640	883640	That's half the characters.
883640	884640	No, he's getting a lip.
884640	885640	He's getting a lip.
885640	886640	Tony Wollin.
886640	887640	Oh, yeah, that guy.
887640	888640	I know what he's talking about.
888640	889640	Yeah.
889640	890640	And he's being played in Bruce Beakstein's band.
890640	892640	But that guy's going to get the lip.
892640	893640	Anyways, goddamn it.
893640	896640	Your impressions never cease to amaze me, but...
896640	898640	I don't care what you think.
898640	899640	I like them.
899640	900640	Oh, thank you.
901640	902640	Dan, this is not going to be one of those nights
902640	903640	where you're feeling persecuted.
903640	904640	This is a night where you feel safe
904640	906640	and you feel happy and protected.
906640	908640	Well, anyways, thank you for...
908640	910640	This is a sponsor, Bombfell.
910640	911640	I'm wearing head-to-toe Bombfell.
911640	912640	You look good in it.
912640	913640	It fits you nice.
913640	914640	Lee.
914640	916640	The pants came...
916640	919640	The first pair of pants, they were a number off.
919640	920640	They didn't get the number wrong.
921640	922640	I was in the room when he tried them on.
922640	925640	He actually took his pants off, went down to his skivvies.
925640	929640	Put them in a bag, sent them back, like a Netflix DVD of Gremlins 2,
929640	931640	said that this is one Gremlin number off.
931640	934640	They sent back these Gremlin 1 pants.
935640	942640	And like Gremlins 1, you remember them as being twice as good
942640	946640	as the other pair, but inside, it's a mess.
947640	951640	That movie is a goddamn mess.
951640	955640	The Gremlins in your head is like a fucking...
955640	956640	It's one of the...
956640	957640	It's filled with a sense of wonder.
957640	960640	It's a Spielberg production, for God's sake.
960640	961640	And it's a Christmas movie.
961640	962640	It's a great Christmas classic.
962640	964640	Oh, and it's just like, oh, the performances.
964640	966640	And it's just like, oh, it gets you right here
966640	968640	and then the Gremlins are scary and all the things.
968640	970640	And you just start watching it from the first frame.
970640	971640	You're like, what is...
971640	974640	What kind of weird driver's-ed movie is this?
975640	978640	How many beginnings are we going to do?
978640	982640	How are you explaining this shit for you fucking idiots?
982640	984640	You shouldn't have made a movie.
984640	985640	Fucking terrible people.
985640	987640	All right, so here's your billion dollars.
987640	988640	What are you going to do?
988640	989640	They make Gremlins 2.
989640	990640	What are we going to listen?
990640	991640	I tell you, I hate you.
991640	993640	You come right back.
994640	996640	I'm Gremlin-ing you.
997640	998640	I'm gas...
999640	1000640	Gremlin...
1000640	1001640	You're Gremlin-ing.
1001640	1002640	Yeah.
1003640	1004640	Gremlin-ing.
1004640	1006640	Please don't let that be the title of this episode.
1006640	1007640	Yeah.
1007640	1008640	Gremlin-ing doesn't really work.
1008640	1009640	Anyways.
1009640	1010640	I'm going to...
1010640	1012640	Invoke the Pepitone.
1012640	1013640	That doesn't work.
1013640	1014640	Anyways, look.
1014640	1019640	I'm not going to say I'm sorry for last week because I am
1019640	1020640	and I'm ashamed.
1021640	1022640	But he's not going to say it.
1022640	1023640	And I'm a liar.
1023640	1025640	No, I...
1025640	1028640	If I make an apology, I want to make it the official one
1028640	1029640	where it's like the three parts.
1029640	1031640	You acknowledge your crime.
1031640	1032640	Okay.
1032640	1034640	I told the audience I hated them.
1035640	1036640	You express remorse.
1036640	1037640	I feel bad.
1039640	1040640	Wait.
1042640	1045640	Are you allowed to make that face after you say it, number two?
1045640	1049640	I feel bad if it made anyone feel bad.
1049640	1050640	That is...
1050640	1051640	You know, but that's not one of those apologists that are like,
1051640	1052640	I'm sorry you felt bad.
1052640	1053640	I'm not doing that.
1053640	1056640	I'm saying I do feel bad if anyone felt bad for it because
1056640	1057640	it was all...
1057640	1058640	The first part is a lie.
1058640	1059640	I don't hate the audience.
1059640	1061640	You make me feel wonderful and you're wonderful people,
1061640	1063640	especially the people that are closest to you,
1063640	1064640	the people that do come here.
1064640	1066640	It was obviously just as with Cody,
1066640	1068640	it's like I'm just saying you people to a bunch of people who
1068640	1071640	bother to be close to me when I'm having some kind of like fucking
1071640	1072640	moment of turmoil.
1073640	1076640	But I'm also a clown on stage and I don't get the impression that
1076640	1077640	anyone got hurt.
1077640	1080640	But if you got hurt, I do feel, of course,
1080640	1082640	bad that it hurt you because it would be a terrible reason to hurt
1082640	1084640	someone because it was a lie.
1085640	1088640	And so then the third part is the commitment to change.
1088640	1090640	So, all right, I'm not going to stop drinking.
1094640	1098640	When I yelled at Cody, I quit Twitter because I'm like,
1098640	1100640	well, I'm not going to stop drinking.
1100640	1103640	I got to change something or this isn't a real apology.
1103640	1104640	I quit Twitter.
1105640	1107640	That wasn't them mixing those two things up.
1107640	1108640	But I did quit.
1108640	1111640	I quit Twitter because I was being mean to the people around me
1111640	1114640	on Twitter, which is like from what I will see on intervention.
1114640	1115640	I'm like, oh, you're a junkie.
1115640	1117640	You're like being mean to people because you're like so focused on
1117640	1118640	this fucking thing.
1118640	1120640	So then I quit Twitter and then I'm like, now I'm like,
1120640	1123640	now I'm having like these weird highs where I'm like,
1123640	1124640	let's go look at shirts.
1124640	1127640	And then like these weird lows where I'm like,
1127640	1129640	you people and your iced tea.
1131640	1135640	But I feel like it's like, it's better than what,
1136640	1141640	it's happening because I was having a problem.
1142640	1145640	So even though it's resulting in half of the time,
1145640	1149640	I'm like a fucking like crazy or the whole time I'm a crazy person
1149640	1152640	and half of the time I'm an unprofitably crazy person.
1152640	1155640	Like it still, it seems like, okay, well,
1155640	1158640	I'm going to wait and see if that goes like this.
1160640	1163640	And then what then I'll be a person that's not on Twitter,
1163640	1165640	but it's also sane.
1165640	1166640	Yeah, it's a weird thing.
1166640	1169640	Like, you know, I just was on tour with Ryan Stiles and Proops
1169640	1170640	and Joel Murray and the gang.
1170640	1173640	And like, you know, we have fun and we, you know,
1173640	1175640	we go do comedy shows, but on the bus,
1175640	1178640	all we do is vent about what was in the news that day.
1178640	1181640	And we get to all of our chests, but then we have to like,
1181640	1182640	like I'm a moody person.
1182640	1183640	I go up and down too.
1183640	1188640	Like, but I feel like my downs are more regular than they used to be.
1188640	1191640	Like I'm in a bad mood more just because of, you know,
1191640	1193640	like just the way things are going right now.
1193640	1195640	And it's nice to be able to go out and do comedy shows
1195640	1199640	and make people laugh and tell stupid jokes and stuff like that.
1200640	1204640	But sometimes it feels almost like disingenuous or dishonest
1204640	1207640	to find any humor in anything.
1207640	1209640	Like you feel like you're forcing it.
1209640	1212640	That's why I was like, yeah, I'm not even being funny anymore.
1212640	1214640	I'm just like arguing with people about shit.
1214640	1216640	Like I used to be able to keep my humor about it.
1216640	1218640	I was like, like, that was my rule.
1218640	1220640	Like, well, if I can be funny while still letting someone know
1220640	1222640	they're a piece of shit, you know, like,
1222640	1224640	then that proves they're a piece of shit.
1224640	1226640	If they can't be funnier than me.
1226640	1228640	If they're a piece of shit, then they're like, you know,
1228640	1231640	if I swear, I want to tread lightly here.
1231640	1236640	But I say this as an observation of how unfunny they are.
1236640	1239640	If a Nazi could ever make anyone laugh, you know,
1239640	1243640	like if there was if it was possible for them to be remotely entertaining,
1243640	1248640	that would be a really dangerous demographic because they'd be like,
1248640	1252640	they don't have any way ever, ever, ever.
1252640	1253640	They can't smile. They don't have pets.
1253640	1254640	Hitler had a dog.
1254640	1255640	They can't smile.
1255640	1256640	Hitler had a dog.
1257640	1259640	Fucking Trump doesn't have a dog.
1259640	1262640	He doesn't have a dog.
1262640	1264640	And so Nazis don't have pets?
1264640	1266640	Well, Hitler loved his dog more than people.
1266640	1267640	I know that.
1267640	1268640	Yeah.
1268640	1269640	A lot of people.
1269640	1272640	I know a lot of misanthropes are big animal people.
1272640	1274640	Rob Schwab.
1274640	1275640	He's not misanthropic.
1275640	1276640	Oh, dude.
1276640	1277640	Yeah. Oh, no.
1277640	1279640	He loves people.
1279640	1280640	All right.
1280640	1283640	Let's just not get derail.
1283640	1284640	He loves animals.
1284640	1285640	I don't think he's good.
1285640	1286640	All right.
1286640	1288640	No, let's let's let's let's let's get our guest up here.
1288640	1289640	Yeah.
1289640	1290640	My good friend, Duncan Trussell.
1290640	1291640	Duncan Trussell.
1295640	1300640	Could have used him last week to bring the here.
1300640	1302640	He might have to walk in through the other door.
1302640	1304640	Duncan Trussell.
1304640	1306640	Oh, yeah.
1306640	1309640	Oh, oh, boy.
1309640	1311640	Sorry about that.
1311640	1312640	Sorry about what?
1312640	1313640	I lost track of time.
1313640	1314640	So that's OK.
1314640	1316640	That means you're doing God's work.
1316640	1319640	Whoa.
1319640	1322640	He already made the whole room happier.
1322640	1325640	Nitrous is always doing God's work.
1325640	1326640	Well, no.
1326640	1328640	A lot of people used to think that they used to think you could
1328640	1330640	use nitrous oxide to commune with spirits.
1330640	1333640	It's actually in that book, The Brief History of Nearly
1333640	1337640	Everything, like if you run out of fuel in your ear beating
1337640	1340640	cannon and you want to really like fuel up and have shit to
1340640	1344640	talk about, to just just beat people's ears into a bloody
1344640	1346640	book, read that book.
1346640	1349640	And apparently some famous scientist was really into
1349640	1352640	nitrous oxide and like used it to commune with angels and
1352640	1353640	stuff.
1353640	1356640	So, yeah, it is doing God's work to do nitrous oxide.
1356640	1357640	I was right.
1360640	1362640	I had a friend in high school who was the best dungeon
1362640	1363640	master ever.
1363640	1364640	Was it Graham?
1364640	1365640	Yeah.
1365640	1368640	Well, yeah, but if he's I don't know, he might be lit.
1369640	1370640	It's fine.
1370640	1371640	It's fine.
1371640	1372640	Yeah.
1372640	1373640	But I know I don't want to embarrass.
1373640	1374640	I don't want to.
1374640	1375640	Graham is listening.
1375640	1376640	I don't want to embarrass him.
1376640	1379640	But like he I lost track of him forever.
1379640	1381640	And then he like I was like an adult in Milwaukee and he showed
1381640	1384640	up and he had like a hit a big tank of nitrous in a plastic
1384640	1385640	hefty bag.
1385640	1386640	And I just got it.
1386640	1388640	And it was like we just the best day of your life.
1388640	1389640	Yeah.
1389640	1392640	Is there any sucking on a garbage bag and talking about how I'm
1392640	1394640	destined to meet people or something?
1394640	1395640	Is there any downs?
1395640	1397640	Is there any deleterious?
1397640	1398640	You might get brain holes.
1398640	1399640	Oh, yeah.
1399640	1400640	It'll fuck you up.
1400640	1401640	It's not.
1401640	1402640	Does it hurt your brain?
1402640	1407640	Or what it what happens is people will make the terrible
1407640	1412640	mistake of putting a nitrous tank in their fucking van.
1412640	1413640	Right.
1413640	1415640	They're like, let's go in the van and do nitrous man.
1415640	1419640	But they leave the tank on while they're doing balloons and
1419640	1424640	they pass out and the van fills up with nitrous oxide.
1424640	1425640	They don't die.
1425640	1426640	They're not.
1426640	1431640	Their bodies vibrate into infinity and they vanish.
1431640	1433640	They level up, kids.
1433640	1434640	They level up.
1434640	1435640	It sounds like dying.
1435640	1440640	Have you ever seen like an abandoned van?
1440640	1445640	Well, I mean, I would say I would say just to start off,
1445640	1447640	don't have a van.
1447640	1448640	Yeah.
1448640	1452640	But just doing nitrous like hurt your brain and kill brain
1452640	1454640	cells or anything bad or is there?
1454640	1456640	Dennis, give it to you.
1456640	1460640	There's you go to the dentist once or twice a year.
1460640	1463640	Am I just am I just am I just a child of Nancy Reagan or just
1463640	1465640	assuming that it gives you brain damage because I heard that
1465640	1466640	somewhere.
1466640	1469640	I mean, there's some isolated cases of brain holes.
1469640	1470640	They're not.
1470640	1473640	It's not like all these people are getting brain holes.
1473640	1475640	It's an epidemic because people have been doing nitrous for
1475640	1479640	fucking ever and there's not like brain holes all over the
1479640	1480640	place.
1480640	1482640	There's a cute few isolated cases.
1482640	1486640	It's definitely bad to deprive your brain and body of oxygen
1486640	1489640	and I would not be surprised if it did cause.
1489640	1492640	But also that depends on the mixture because if you go like
1492640	1495640	half air and half nitrous, I don't know how bad that is for
1495640	1496640	your brain.
1496640	1497640	You know what you sound like?
1497640	1499640	A nitrous oxide dealer.
1499640	1502640	Oh, no.
1502640	1505640	I definitely don't have free canisters.
1505640	1508640	It's not like I'm negotiating a nitrous oxide deal with a
1508640	1509640	nitrous.
1509640	1510640	I don't know, man.
1510640	1513640	I mean, maybe if we go half, your brain will be okay.
1513640	1517640	It's $5 a balloon, baby.
1517640	1521640	Can we, is it irresponsible podcasting for us to get a tank
1521640	1523640	of some balloons for our next show?
1523640	1524640	No.
1524640	1525640	No, no.
1525640	1526640	Let's do it.
1526640	1527640	Oh, man.
1527640	1528640	Oh, I know how to do it too.
1528640	1529640	I know how to get a tank.
1529640	1531640	Let me answer that question with a question.
1531640	1535640	Which is it an irresponsible society to elect a rapist Nazi
1536640	1541640	and then just hang out and watch the world fall apart without
1541640	1544640	doing nitrous publicly?
1544640	1547640	So it's not irresponsible.
1547640	1548640	We can do it, then.
1548640	1549640	Yes, I'm saying.
1549640	1550640	You're signing off on it.
1550640	1551640	Yes, Rome is burning.
1551640	1555640	Let's try Yahtzee if you haven't.
1555640	1557640	My advice to everyone.
1557640	1559640	Don't try everything.
1559640	1560640	Anything but Yahtzee.
1560640	1561640	I got that covered.
1561640	1562640	Yahtzee.
1562640	1564640	You don't need to try Yahtzee.
1564640	1570640	There's only one lemonade you can get from the lemon of social
1570640	1573640	upheaval, deterioration, whatever we think we're experiencing.
1573640	1577640	The only lemonade is people popping like popcorn,
1577640	1580640	having a little controllable nervous breakdown and going,
1580640	1583640	well, if this shit's happening, I'm going to try making that birdhouse.
1583640	1584640	Well, let's talk.
1584640	1585640	Okay.
1585640	1588640	And that guy turning out to be the Frank Lloyd Wright of birdhouses
1588640	1590640	and didn't know it because he was just like,
1590640	1592640	if I keep voting Republican, I'll get rewarded.
1592640	1595640	And then he's just like, wait, he said what to who?
1595640	1597640	I'm the birdhouse.
1597640	1598640	Boom.
1598640	1599640	I'm a genius.
1599640	1600640	I never needed to.
1600640	1601640	I'm a Democrat now.
1601640	1604640	But the problem, the problem with Frank Lloyd Wright birdhouses
1604640	1607640	is that they look great, but they're really uncomfortable.
1607640	1609640	Well, also the birds hate him.
1609640	1612640	The birds hate him because Frank Lloyd Wright's gimmick was like trying to
1612640	1615640	like, you know, like, oh, can you make a home merge with nature?
1615640	1618640	And the birds like, what the fuck do you think I'm moving in here for?
1618640	1621640	I wanted a birdhouse.
1621640	1624640	I want to say the n-word so bad, I want the bird to like, say,
1624640	1625640	punctuate it with the n-word.
1625640	1626640	Just say it.
1626640	1627640	No, no.
1627640	1628640	Wait, look.
1628640	1631640	You just said that you could try anything now that a Nazi made this one.
1631640	1632640	Well, look.
1632640	1633640	But, you know, I want to talk to you about this.
1633640	1634640	I'm not going to try.
1634640	1638640	I want to talk to you about this idea of like, Rome burning.
1638640	1639640	All right.
1639640	1644640	Because I was thinking about today, and I was thinking like, okay,
1644640	1651640	if you have to pick an evil monster to deal with in your life,
1651640	1656640	would you rather that evil monster to be smart,
1656640	1660640	or would you rather that evil monster to be Donald Trump?
1660640	1661640	Right.
1661640	1662640	But I think we've all agreed.
1662640	1665640	I mean, we've all had this conversation on each other's podcasts,
1665640	1667640	and we've had nine months to talk about this,
1667640	1670640	and what we've arrived at is it's not really him that's bumming us out.
1670640	1675640	It's the reveal of the engine underneath our country
1675640	1678640	that made it possible for him to be elected,
1678640	1680640	and it's the reaction that everyone's having to be elected.
1680640	1681640	But this is good.
1681640	1683640	No, he's swell.
1683640	1685640	No, I agree with you.
1685640	1686640	Yeah, I think we all agree with that.
1686640	1688640	But we're like, yeah, if you're going to...
1688640	1691640	Oh, he's like Hitler, but he hasn't done anything yet.
1691640	1692640	No, I don't mean that.
1692640	1693640	He's funny.
1693640	1695640	He's got like clown hair, and he's running around.
1695640	1696640	He's farting.
1696640	1697640	But...
1697640	1699640	He probably doesn't fart.
1699640	1700640	But the fact that we...
1700640	1701640	Oh, he fucking farts.
1701640	1703640	They had to move his sphincter to the crown of his head
1703640	1706640	for his weird experimental hair.
1706640	1709640	Remember the time when he got up and didn't sign the executive order
1709640	1711640	and he was supposed to sign some shit,
1711640	1712640	and he just got up and walked out and...
1712640	1713640	Oh, yeah.
1713640	1714640	Motherfucker, you're like, no, you got to do the thing.
1714640	1716640	He clearly pooped his pants.
1716640	1720640	He made chocolate poopies and had to get the fuck out of there.
1720640	1721640	Right, right.
1721640	1722640	Yeah, no.
1722640	1724640	At his age, I mean, I shit my pants all the time.
1724640	1725640	Yeah.
1725640	1727640	On the reg, as the kids say.
1728640	1730640	On the reg, fam.
1731640	1732640	Oh, grandpa.
1732640	1735640	If you get me high enough and I cough and then walk away...
1740640	1742640	...we'd be glad we weren't carpooling.
1742640	1743640	That's...
1743640	1745640	Oh, dear Christ.
1747640	1749640	But no, I mean, we're...
1749640	1753640	It's like, if we thought that we could have just him...
1753640	1755640	But it's what he represents and all that shit.
1756640	1757640	We all...
1757640	1759640	I think most of us even...
1759640	1761640	We're like, you know what?
1761640	1763640	And now it doesn't even matter.
1763640	1764640	What if we...
1764640	1773640	If the blue side of this weird two-headed beast now takes advantage of the nauseating...
1773640	1775640	Whatever happens next, we all agree.
1775640	1777640	We're going to be more bummed out about it.
1777640	1779640	Universal health care.
1779640	1784640	No, universal health care is that's what happens is you get this bumbling guy
1784640	1787640	who freaks out all of his underlings
1787640	1793640	into the point of trying to jam through these rotten fucking health care bills
1793640	1796640	alerting everyone in the country.
1796640	1800640	This is what happens when you let super wealthy people be in control.
1800640	1801640	They don't care about you.
1801640	1804640	This isn't a new idea that's been happening since the fucking Industrial Revolution.
1804640	1806640	So you have this nice reminder.
1806640	1808640	Look what happens when they start running shit.
1808640	1810640	They don't care if you die.
1810640	1811640	Now everyone knows it.
1811640	1815640	And then because John McCain has this brain tumor
1815640	1817640	and he doesn't care about getting reelected
1817640	1819640	and he's not in it for politics anymore,
1819640	1822640	this guy stops the whole fucking thing
1822640	1825640	which means we're one step closer to universal health care.
1825640	1831640	So I'm not saying this is because Trump is meaning that to happen or good.
1831640	1833640	He's obviously just this...
1833640	1838640	He's exactly what you would imagine the Antichrist would look like.
1838640	1840640	But still, in that...
1840640	1841640	No, really.
1841640	1844640	Does anyone here look at the Bible
1844640	1847640	and check to see if anyone's the Antichrist?
1847640	1849640	Because Trump might be the Antichrist.
1849640	1851640	Well, the last time I checked,
1851640	1856640	the Antichrist had a fatal head wound that he recovered from.
1856640	1857640	It's like a description.
1857640	1858640	Is that true?
1858640	1859640	Yeah.
1859640	1863640	I tweeted it to you because you were talking about something that I was like...
1863640	1864640	Oh.
1864640	1865640	Because we always...
1865640	1866640	I don't always check my Twitter.
1866640	1869640	Everybody always thinks the Book of Revelations is talking about Bill Clinton
1869640	1870640	or whatever.
1870640	1872640	They always update who it's talking about.
1872640	1874640	Yeah, everyone thought Obama was the Antichrist.
1874640	1875640	But one thing's for sure.
1875640	1876640	Because I was always going like,
1876640	1877640	well, I've read Revelations.
1877640	1882640	I'm waiting for a guy who gets shot in the head in a war but he survives
1882640	1883640	and then everyone...
1883640	1885640	He's like a war hero because it kind of says,
1885640	1887640	I looked and he had a wound in his head
1887640	1890640	and yet he lived or something like that.
1890640	1892640	And it's like, oh, God, it's his scalp surgery.
1892640	1894640	It's his fucking...
1895640	1897640	If you were looking at Donald Trump,
1897640	1901640	but you had the x-ray vision provided to you by Christ,
1901640	1904640	you wouldn't see his fake hair and anything.
1904640	1907640	You'd see him as a ghost, an aura,
1907640	1909640	and you'd see at the top of his head, just like Darth Vader,
1909640	1914640	there'd be this amazing fucking weird symbol or something
1914640	1917640	where this weird doctor tried to twist his head
1917640	1923640	like a fucking end of a sausage to make his sideburns turn into his hair.
1923640	1926640	Something that hurt him enough that he ran into his wife's bedroom
1926640	1928640	and pulled her hair out and yelled at her
1928640	1936640	and as she put it, had sex with his semi-hard penis.
1938640	1940640	And then she went and cried in her mom's room for two days
1940640	1942640	and when she came back, her hair was still spread on the bed
1942640	1944640	and he was laying there in his bathroom and he said,
1944640	1946640	does it hurt?
1947640	1951640	So logistically, if we want to do nitrous,
1951640	1953640	do we get tanks and balloons up here?
1953640	1955640	I know how to do it. I know how to do it.
1955640	1957640	I know how to get nitrous.
1957640	1959640	I looked it up. I know how to get nitrous.
1959640	1963640	Are we breaking any kind of criminal codes by doing it?
1963640	1965640	I know how to do it.
1965640	1967640	Not if there's a dentist present.
1967640	1969640	You don't need a dentist.
1969640	1973640	So what you do is you apply for a catering license in L.A.
1973640	1974640	For real?
1974640	1977640	Yeah. And if you apply for a catering license,
1977640	1981640	I guess caterers are always making whipped cream or something?
1981640	1983640	Always. They can't get it.
1983640	1985640	You can buy a tank of nitrous.
1985640	1989640	We're talking about how to score, not how to make it legal.
1991640	1994640	You can just buy it. I can go right now
1994640	1996640	and buy some whipped cream chargers.
1996640	2000640	You can go buy nitrous little canisters and do whippets.
2000640	2001640	Yeah, but those are annoying.
2001640	2003640	You get these silver things all over your fucking tank.
2003640	2005640	I'm not saying it's not impossible.
2006640	2009640	Legally, we're probably not allowed to do a podcast
2009640	2011640	for recreational purposes.
2011640	2013640	But if you get arrested for that,
2013640	2016640	that's the coolest way to get arrested.
2016640	2018640	There's cool ways to get arrested.
2018640	2020640	I want to make sure we know who we're getting into.
2020640	2023640	I want to get arrested for doing nitrous oxide on Hormentown.
2023640	2026640	All right. Just fucking do it.
2026640	2029640	I want to get dragged downtown.
2030640	2034640	Like the Van Halen video.
2034640	2037640	We're in towels for no reason.
2037640	2040640	Panama!
2042640	2043640	Look it up.
2043640	2047640	And look up that thing where he pulled his wife's hair out of her head.
2047640	2050640	They wore towels in Panama in the video?
2050640	2053640	Yeah, there was a shot of David Lee Roth being like...
2053640	2054640	And I don't know if it was fake or...
2054640	2056640	It was probably fake.
2056640	2059640	But it was David Lee Roth in a towel
2059640	2065640	being pulled from a hotel by cops or something.
2065640	2067640	Oh boy. That's a score.
2067640	2069640	I think it was Panama.
2069640	2072640	Anyways, look, what about that girl in intervention
2072640	2076640	who inhaled the keyboard cleaner stuff?
2076640	2079640	What's the keyboard cleaner?
2079640	2082640	That's not the same as doing nitrous.
2082640	2085640	No, that's got to be some kind of other chemical.
2085640	2087640	So she was fucking herself up.
2087640	2088640	She still made it through.
2088640	2089640	She emerged.
2089640	2091640	I watched the reunion specials.
2091640	2092640	Yeah, right.
2092640	2094640	But I wonder where she's at now, man.
2094640	2096640	They need to do it rarely now.
2096640	2099640	That's all the intervention fans' favorite episode
2099640	2101640	because she's just...
2101640	2103640	I'm living the dream!
2103640	2105640	There's a gif of her.
2105640	2107640	She's like...
2107640	2109640	I feel like I'm walking on sunshine.
2109640	2111640	It's so disturbing.
2111640	2115640	There's a cleaner specific to keyboards?
2115640	2117640	Well, it's like your computer's keyboard.
2117640	2120640	Oh wait, I've got a great story about this, man.
2120640	2123640	Computer cleaner, like a blast of air.
2123640	2124640	Oh, I got you, yeah.
2124640	2128640	I have some friends in New York who sublet their apartment to somebody
2128640	2131640	and they got a call from their landlord
2131640	2132640	and their landlord's like,
2132640	2134640	hey, you need to come back.
2134640	2135640	And they're like, why?
2135640	2139640	And he's like, well, because the person you sublet your apartment to
2139640	2142640	is dead on your couch.
2142640	2147640	And so they come back to the fucking apartment
2147640	2152640	and this guy is surrounded by keyboard cleaner.
2152640	2157640	Like, he went to Target and bought, I guess,
2157640	2160640	$1,000 worth of keyboard cleaner
2160640	2163640	and committed suicide via keyboard cleaner
2163640	2166640	and he had melted into their couch.
2166640	2171640	So it's just this like purple bloated melted corpse
2171640	2176640	surrounded by Target bags and keyboard fucking cleaner.
2176640	2177640	What a dick!
2177640	2179640	That's a...
2179640	2181640	Bad...
2181640	2184640	That's bad subletting.
2184640	2185640	We know that.
2185640	2186640	That's like, come on.
2186640	2189640	Whatever happens, it matters.
2189640	2191640	There's so many better ways to do it.
2191640	2193640	You're a guest in their house.
2193640	2197640	Asimov's Four Laws of Subletting.
2197640	2201640	First, do no cleaners.
2201640	2202640	Clean.
2202640	2204640	You just inhale it?
2204640	2206640	I guess you inhale it.
2206640	2207640	I don't know.
2207640	2209640	Maybe they put it in a bag and breathe it out of the bag.
2209640	2210640	I'm not sure.
2210640	2212640	She was just sucking on a straw
2212640	2215640	and she actually had burns on her lips.
2215640	2218640	I think you want the propellant or whatever that liquid stuff is.
2218640	2220640	I think it's that chemical that they're into.
2220640	2224640	Who knows?
2224640	2227640	Their bottom lines in the intervention episode
2227640	2230640	is that they were going to call animal control
2230640	2232640	because she had cats that she loved
2232640	2234640	but they were worried about her cats.
2234640	2237640	You had to try to find these bottom lines to leverage this stuff.
2237640	2240640	They pull the trigger on because she walks out of the intervention
2240640	2242640	and they're like, all right, call the cops,
2242640	2244640	call the animal people about the cats.
2244640	2246640	The cops come to her door
2246640	2249640	and she's hanging out in her bedroom with her sister
2249640	2252640	and then someone says like, hey, the police are here
2252640	2257640	and she goes like, the po-po.
2257640	2259640	Hey, can I say something kind of self-indulgent
2259640	2262640	just to add to something that you said before I came out?
2262640	2264640	You said this thing.
2264640	2265640	You're not on Twitter anymore.
2265640	2267640	You said this thing.
2267640	2270640	I'm not going to quote you right, so forgive me,
2270640	2271640	but you said something else.
2271640	2272640	I don't feel like making people laugh.
2272640	2274640	I'm down more than I'm up.
2274640	2276640	Yeah, yeah.
2276640	2277640	You know, man, this is really cheesy.
2277640	2280640	Maybe somebody could play the national anthem while I say this,
2280640	2285640	but I feel like the moment people like you and you
2285640	2287640	start getting like that,
2287640	2293640	then if there really was some kind of nefarious cobble of evil people
2293640	2296640	who wanted to destroy art on planet Earth
2296640	2299640	by making artists feel completely hopeless,
2299640	2303640	then the moment you guys are like, I'm not going to go on Twitter anymore.
2303640	2305640	I'm not going to do this shit anymore.
2305640	2306640	They fucking win.
2306640	2308640	They're really winning then,
2308640	2313640	and then the thing that you guys put out in the universe gets thwarted by what?
2313640	2315640	Some fucking like, what?
2315640	2316640	Like, really?
2316640	2318640	That's depressing to me.
2318640	2320640	That's part of the bummer of walking away from it,
2320640	2323640	and it's also part of the hook that keeps you there,
2323640	2326640	but the nice different split is just begin off the white
2326640	2330640	and like, go away, evolve, come back.
2330640	2332640	I'm not going to delete my account.
2332640	2334640	Twitter doesn't have to be a factor in it.
2335640	2337640	The beauty of being on tour,
2337640	2339640	I was on the road for the last couple weeks,
2339640	2342640	is that when you wake up in a bad mood and you turn on the news
2342640	2346640	and it's just shocking and it goes against everything that you believe in,
2346640	2351640	just simple things like his ties and his fucking, you know,
2351640	2355640	like the misuse of the English language and all that shit.
2355640	2360640	Forget about the hatred of women and people of color and fucking everything.
2361640	2366640	The great news is that we have to stay focused enough to go on stage
2366640	2370640	and still be funny, and then the fact that we get to go do that is awesome.
2370640	2373640	And because when we're on stage, that's the easiest part of the day,
2373640	2376640	to go out there and just tell a dick joke.
2376640	2378640	Make the world happy.
2378640	2379640	Sure, yeah.
2379640	2381640	Yeah, you're absolutely right.
2381640	2384640	We can't just all descend into sadness and darkness.
2384640	2386640	No, you have to double fight.
2386640	2387640	That's the thing.
2387640	2390640	Not only do you have to not descend into sadness and darkness,
2390640	2392640	you have to triple activate.
2392640	2395640	The whole point is to go the opposite direction,
2395640	2397640	even though it is bleak and horrible.
2397640	2400640	I mean, it always seems like, God forgive me, man,
2400640	2403640	because there's no job of a comedian or job of anybody else
2403640	2407640	or job of comedy or any of that bullshit.
2407640	2413640	But just from a basic like, when the darkness grows,
2413640	2416640	then that's when you're really supposed to be shining the light.
2416640	2417640	Praise God.
2417640	2420640	And if you're not fucking doing that, then what are you doing?
2420640	2421640	Exactly, I agree.
2421640	2424640	The thing about now, if you're going to be a comedian,
2424640	2429640	the community should stick to comedy and leave politics to the experts.
2429640	2430640	Well, there are no fucking experts.
2430640	2433640	Politicians should stick to politics and not do comedy.
2433640	2436640	But when you go on stage and you tell a joke, it's really funny.
2436640	2440640	We're in Indianapolis, you can talk shit about Mike Pence,
2440640	2442640	because they hate him in Indianapolis.
2442640	2445640	You go outside of Indianapolis, they love, it's a red state.
2445640	2446640	They love him there.
2446640	2449640	But you can hammer on fucking Mike Pence in Indianapolis.
2449640	2451640	But the thing is, when you tell a really...
2451640	2453640	Let's say it's not even a political joke,
2453640	2456640	you just mention him or say something stupid.
2456640	2461640	The people don't feel comfortable laughing about anything political.
2461640	2464640	I know that no one wants to hear Dan and I or our guests
2464640	2466640	or Spencer and us talk politics about Trump.
2466640	2468640	We don't have anything new to say.
2468640	2470640	It's just us grossing about the same old shit.
2470640	2474640	But when you do a show like, you know, we go out and do improv and do comedy,
2474640	2476640	you can tell some neutral joke and mention Donald Trump
2476640	2480640	or mention Nancy DeVos or mention whoever.
2480640	2483640	People that might have laughed don't know who they're sitting next to
2483640	2485640	and they don't know if the person next to them is going to be really into that
2485640	2487640	or not into that or whatever.
2487640	2490640	So everyone is just kind of neutralized
2490640	2493640	and things don't get to be as funny
2493640	2495640	because no one knows if their parents are going to be pissed off
2495640	2498640	or the neighbor is sitting next to them or whatever.
2498640	2502640	Like comedy, you either have to be not talking about politics at all
2502640	2505640	or you have to be hilarious or be Lenny Bruce
2505640	2507640	and be punk rock and George Carlin and shit
2507640	2509640	and like fucking be so, so active.
2509640	2510640	Be a comedian.
2510640	2511640	I mean, that's the idea.
2511640	2512640	It's like, fuck it.
2512640	2514640	The idea is like, okay, fine.
2514640	2516640	My instincts are telling me this is funny.
2516640	2520640	And I'm in some stupid time period where people are incredibly confused.
2520640	2521640	Okay, fine.
2521640	2524640	Well, still, blast it out there, man.
2524640	2528640	Blast it out there because the moment any of us stop blasting it out there,
2528640	2531640	then they win.
2531640	2535640	They win if you keep blasting and you, in my opinion,
2535640	2536640	at least this goes for me.
2536640	2539640	There's people out there that are good at being angry
2539640	2541640	and we want them to be angry.
2541640	2546640	But if I've lost my humor,
2546640	2550640	then what am I going to fall back on, my political science degree?
2550640	2552640	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
2552640	2553640	Look what Jimmy Kimmel just did.
2553640	2556640	Jimmy Kimmel, what he did is he either read,
2556640	2559640	he fucking researched and it was like, that's my point.
2560640	2567640	That's why I'm like, I need to fucking step out of this professional wrestling ring.
2567640	2569640	Stop running around with a folding chair
2569640	2571640	that looks identical to everyone else's
2571640	2573640	and just being part of the general melee
2573640	2577640	because part of what the enemy wants you to think is that life sucks
2577640	2579640	and that it's chaotic and stupid and all that stuff.
2579640	2584640	So that is why when Lauren Duca tweets,
2584640	2587640	when my heroes on Twitter right now,
2588640	2591640	they're the people that are like, they have this insight
2591640	2594640	but then they're also like, they have this grace.
2594640	2596640	And then you go like, oh, that's an advertisement
2596640	2598640	for being on the good guy's side
2598640	2601640	because it's not that this stuff isn't important
2601640	2602640	and shouldn't make you angry.
2602640	2604640	It's that if you're a billboard,
2604640	2606640	you can't be a billboard dripping with shit
2606640	2608640	because then everyone's like, well, I don't want to buy that razor.
2608640	2609640	It's covered in shit.
2609640	2611640	Like that person's not happy.
2611640	2613640	That person keeps telling me,
2613640	2616640	people give me advice all the time like from 40 years.
2616640	2618640	The reason why I haven't quit drinking yet
2618640	2623640	is because everyone that's ever asserted it with any degree of assertion
2623640	2625640	is they're miserable.
2625640	2627640	It's always a deal breaker.
2627640	2629640	I'm like, look, man, come up to me.
2629640	2633640	Chris Hardwick's like the biggest billboard for sobriety I've ever encountered.
2633640	2636640	He's genuinely a happy-seeming guy.
2636640	2640640	But behind his eyes, I think maybe he goes home and does stuff to...
2641640	2643640	There's fucking...
2643640	2645640	That's none of my business.
2645640	2647640	I've been to his place in this target bag.
2647640	2649640	It's fucking everywhere.
2651640	2653640	I'm just saying, I don't know what's in those bags.
2653640	2656640	But he's like the most pleasant...
2656640	2660640	Anyway, I'm just saying, if you're telling people to lighten up
2660640	2662640	or if you're telling people to...
2662640	2664640	You really ought to know your facts.
2664640	2667640	Whenever you're telling somebody else what to do,
2667640	2669640	holy shit, you better be happier than them.
2669640	2672640	Yeah, but with comedy, man, the thing I always love about it
2672640	2676640	is not so much it's like ethical compass or moral compass.
2676640	2679640	What I love about it is the way it warps reality.
2679640	2684640	And I love the way that with comedy and our really great, great comedians,
2684640	2688640	what they do is, regardless of anything other than just this...
2688640	2690640	Now, this is not to say, this is how we should act.
2690640	2693640	Comedians should only be funny or comedians should not be funny now or whatever.
2693640	2696640	I'm just saying, the moment you encounter great art,
2697640	2701640	whether it's comedy or a painting or a movie, you feel hope.
2701640	2705640	Because you're like, humans are fucking cool. That's amazing.
2705640	2709640	And when you start watching comedians warp what's happening right now
2709640	2711640	in any kind of way at all that's successful,
2711640	2714640	no matter how lofty or how mundane,
2714640	2719640	I think it adds to the sum total of joy in the world.
2719640	2721640	And the more joy there is in the world...
2721640	2723640	I just got back from Burning Man.
2724640	2727640	The more joy there is in the world,
2727640	2731640	the more chance we have to make sure that we don't do this again.
2731640	2734640	And that's why it's important to fucking fight.
2737640	2738640	Thank you.
2738640	2741640	I said Nancy DeVos, I meant Betsy DeVos.
2744640	2746640	I'm still wondering if it's Lauren Duca,
2746640	2749640	because half the time I say Lauren De Luca.
2750640	2757640	No, I don't think we're disagreeing on any important points, right?
2764640	2766640	You're saying it's important to be...
2766640	2771640	for entertainers, that word seems cringe-worthy.
2774640	2775640	They become important.
2775640	2778640	The fact that I'm not on Twitter and I heard about the Kimmel thing
2778640	2781640	is why Jimmy Kimmel did a good thing.
2781640	2785640	It raises all this awareness.
2790640	2793640	But it's particularly great that it wasn't just some quip.
2793640	2799640	It was also, on top of it, he was passionate and in a funny way,
2799640	2804640	is making this part of the sideshow, now front and center.
2804640	2806640	That's why it's so important.
2806640	2807640	I agree with all that.
2807640	2809640	And that's exactly why...
2809640	2811640	I'm just sitting there talking to...
2811640	2813640	I'm just arguing with fucking...
2813640	2815640	I'm going like, I'm going to block you!
2815640	2816640	I'm going to block you!
2816640	2818640	I can't believe over the last couple of days,
2818640	2821640	I started to like Kim Jong-un, the NFL, and Jimmy Kimmel.
2821640	2824640	Yes! It's the apocalypse, baby!
2826640	2829640	When did quarterbacks become agitators?
2829640	2830640	It's fucking amazing.
2830640	2831640	It's glorious.
2831640	2832640	That's fucked up.
2832640	2834640	I can't believe it turns out James Woods,
2834640	2837640	when he played Roy Cohn, apparently, was doing it
2837640	2839640	because he thought he was a cool guy.
2839640	2842640	I didn't know James Woods was a fucking monster.
2842640	2844640	Holy shit.
2844640	2847640	I used to think of guys playing monsters when you're casting a monster.
2847640	2848640	Like, we need a monster.
2848640	2849640	Ah, let's get that guy.
2849640	2852640	It's not like an actual monster that shows up.
2852640	2854640	A monster performance?
2854640	2856640	Here we go.
2856640	2857640	You need to do this cocaine.
2857640	2859640	You need to do this cocaine.
2859640	2860640	Cut!
2860640	2861640	Jimmy, great.
2861640	2862640	Oh, wow, you're amazing.
2862640	2865640	I'm conditioned by Hollywood to expect that guy to act like Tom Hanks
2865640	2867640	as soon as they call Cut, you know?
2867640	2869640	Where's a baby? Let me kiss it.
2869640	2870640	No.
2870640	2875640	But he's just like fucking slime in a human-shaped cup.
2875640	2878640	What you're saying, I think what we're all saying,
2878640	2882640	is you can't just be a comedian and go out and tell jokes and have fun now.
2882640	2884640	You have to do two things at once now.
2884640	2887640	You have to be doing squats and push-ups at the same time.
2887640	2890640	You have to still be fighting for what you believe in,
2890640	2892640	which is not always going to be funny,
2892640	2897640	and then you still have to smile and help other people laugh and do that, too.
2897640	2899640	It just depends on where you land, man,
2899640	2902640	because it's like some of us believe that, like,
2902640	2905640	God damn it, what do they say in Game of Thrones?
2905640	2906640	Chaos is a ladder.
2906640	2908640	What do they say? Is that the word?
2908640	2909640	Oh, yeah. Chaos is a ladder.
2909640	2913640	But some of us, some people just believe that it's like, yes, if you can,
2913640	2917640	whatever, what I always loved about comedians is that you,
2917640	2919640	comedians get to do whatever they want.
2919640	2922640	That means that if you want to be completely shallow,
2922640	2927640	have nothing to do with politics and just blurt out some ridiculous thing,
2927640	2929640	you can do that. It's okay.
2929640	2936640	Also, if you feel like you have some heady thing to say that has no punchline,
2936640	2938640	you can say that, too.
2938640	2940640	You're a fucking comedian.
2940640	2945640	You represent the part of the human spirit that is unconquerable by the gods,
2945640	2947640	which means that you are ultimately free.
2947640	2951640	You can do whatever you want, no matter who the president is
2951640	2952640	or who the president isn't.
2952640	2954640	So no comedian has a moral obligation.
2954640	2956640	No comedian doesn't have a moral obligation.
2956640	2960640	But any time a comedian successfully pulls off real comedy,
2960640	2962640	they're bending space, if you ask me.
2962640	2967640	And that bending of space and time and the paradigm and the gestalt
2967640	2969640	and the archetypes is a fucking miracle.
2969640	2971640	And whenever it happens, people are like,
2971640	2975640	holy shit, this is a pretty good universe, hurricanes, earthquakes and all.
2975640	2978640	And that makes people feel a little more excited about being alive.
2978640	2983640	And that means that my friend's couch won't end up with a fucking rotting corpse on it.
2983640	2985640	Somebody's sucking back nitrous oxide.
2985640	2990640	I feel like we're just only a couple years away from when art and politics beautifully merge,
2990640	2993640	when we have Senator Kid Rock for a guy that's really...
2993640	2994640	Because that's where...
2994640	2995640	Can't wait.
2995640	2998640	That's where I get back on board.
2998640	3001640	We're great. People are great. We don't need them.
3001640	3003640	That's the main thing. We don't need them.
3004640	3006640	We're going to be fine no matter what.
3006640	3008640	This is fucking harm in town. We're fine.
3008640	3010640	This is supposed to be a cult. What happened?
3010640	3012640	We're going to be fucking fine.
3015640	3016640	Well, we proved it last week.
3016640	3019640	Dan told everyone to go fuck themselves and they're still here.
3019640	3022640	That's exactly what a cult leader does. Come on.
3022640	3028640	Next week I start revealing that I somehow need to sow the seeds of the...
3028640	3030640	Let's do it.
3031640	3035640	And according to the book of whatever I'm reading,
3035640	3040640	it just shakes out that the age of the girl has to be...
3040640	3041640	Okay.
3044640	3046640	It was like David Chas was like...
3046640	3050640	It was like ten years from now because now that we're on live stream and stuff like that,
3050640	3053640	the shots of the audience, you just start noticing that everyone starts wearing the same color.
3053640	3054640	Do it.
3054640	3056640	We're all wearing white outfits all of a sudden.
3056640	3060640	Let's do it. Let's all wear white outfits and do nitrous oxide
3060640	3064640	and move to the next level of the show.
3064640	3066640	Let's all get...
3066640	3070640	We'll do a big art installation and we'll build the world's biggest van.
3072640	3074640	We'll all get in that van.
3074640	3077640	We'll all just start doing nitrous together.
3077640	3079640	Uh...
3083640	3086640	Yeah, I'm glad it all happened.
3086640	3088640	I'm a big piece of shit in a fucking blowhard.
3088640	3089640	No, you're not.
3089640	3090640	I've been wrong about everything.
3090640	3093640	It's good to start there. It's like a second childhood now.
3093640	3096640	I'm like, oh man, I didn't know what any of that shit meant.
3096640	3100640	Also, another side of that thing that you're talking about where comedians are like...
3100640	3104640	It's good that comedians were basically like after the election, they were like,
3104640	3107640	look, man, I can't.
3107640	3110640	What do you mean get back to work? Get back to work doing what?
3110640	3112640	What I was doing before was...
3112640	3115640	But then as they're explaining that and having to defend themselves,
3115640	3119640	for me, it was like there was this valve in my head where I was like,
3119640	3121640	wait, what's the rest of that sentence?
3121640	3124640	Because you need to acknowledge that what you're really saying
3124640	3127640	is that you were kind of happy with the way society was before.
3127640	3130640	You did a lot of fucking complaining.
3130640	3133640	You constantly acted like you were above everything.
3133640	3136640	Because that was like an easier way to...
3136640	3138640	I don't know, it was just easier in general.
3138640	3140640	It was easier to live that way, easier to be funny.
3140640	3144640	Now, that's another good reason why this happened because I think comics are like,
3144640	3145640	well, wait.
3145640	3151640	Listen, my flowchart, I woke up in the morning and looked at a newspaper,
3151640	3154640	then put it out of my head and put my clown shoes on.
3154640	3158640	My whole thing was that I lived in the world that we were living in together
3158640	3162640	and also was entertaining you and was able to say whatever I wanted.
3162640	3165640	Don't tell me to get back to work and ignore what's going on.
3165640	3167640	But there is that interesting part.
3167640	3170640	It's like, oh, because you weren't talking about politics before.
3170640	3174640	Not that you should have, but it's interesting then to retroactively go like,
3174640	3179640	oh, jeez, I guess I liked my bipartisan fucking technocracy.
3179640	3180640	I liked my oligarchy.
3180640	3184640	I liked my thinly veiled or thickly veiled fascism.
3184640	3187640	I liked my right of center...
3187640	3189640	Well, why do you admit that at least?
3189640	3192640	It was the earliest world empire when my toilet paper was soft
3192640	3196640	because somehow indirectly it was softened with air of blood.
3196640	3199640	It was like, oh, man, this feels so extra.
3199640	3200640	It's never been proven.
3200640	3201640	It's never been proven.
3201640	3203640	Somehow there's a way to prove it.
3203640	3209640	I'm sure there was a time when British colonists here were like,
3209640	3211640	this is great.
3211640	3213640	We're paying a lot of taxes.
3213640	3214640	This is okay.
3214640	3217640	Oh, man, can you imagine the fucking arguments back then?
3217640	3221640	It's like you're committing treason for real if you were patriotic.
3221640	3222640	Yeah, you were a terrorist.
3222640	3227640	But you realize it's like, okay, so you and I are the same age,
3227640	3234640	which means that we have lived for our entire lives without the fear of the draft.
3234640	3240640	So we've lived our entire lives with these kind of outrageous American wars that happen.
3240640	3244640	American wars are really interesting because in most other places when there's a war,
3244640	3246640	it's like an actual bar fight.
3246640	3248640	You hit the person, they hit you back.
3248640	3252640	An American war, we hit the person, they don't hit us back.
3252640	3255640	And when they do hit us back, if they don't hit us back in a way that we've deemed
3255640	3258640	the right way to hit us back, then we call them terrorists.
3258640	3260640	So that's an American war.
3260640	3266640	So we've been living in a time period where every single city that we've lived in,
3266640	3268640	thank God, has not been bombed.
3268640	3270640	I guarantee you don't know what a bomb smells like.
3270640	3271640	I sure as fuck don't.
3271640	3272640	Don't fucking high road me.
3272640	3274640	I'm going to high road you bitch.
3274640	3276640	I grew up in Milwaukee.
3276640	3279640	That's like the Belfast of Wisconsin.
3279640	3282640	Okay, you know what a bomb smells like?
3282640	3284640	You know what an M80 is?
3284640	3287640	My friend Tony Schumacher almost took his thumb off.
3287640	3289640	Just imagine a lot of M80s.
3289640	3291640	That's what a bomb smells like.
3291640	3294640	Well, you also pray don't know what it smells like.
3294640	3295640	None of us know, thank God.
3295640	3299640	Many of us don't know, I hope most of us, all of us don't know what it smells like
3299640	3301640	when a bunch of people are on fire together.
3301640	3302640	We don't know that.
3302640	3303640	That's an American war.
3303640	3304640	We set people on fire.
3304640	3305640	We blow them up.
3305640	3306640	We disintegrate them.
3306640	3309640	We're doing it for a very, very long time.
3309640	3314640	So now what's happening is that shit's getting weird for us.
3314640	3319640	And we don't want it to be weird because we don't want to get pushed into actual action.
3319640	3320640	Yeah, exactly.
3320640	3321640	That sucks.
3321640	3322640	But guess what?
3322640	3324640	You've got to fucking do it, man.
3324640	3325640	No.
3325640	3326640	It doesn't?
3326640	3327640	You got to.
3327640	3328640	No.
3328640	3329640	You have to.
3329640	3330640	I'm old.
3330640	3331640	I was almost retired.
3331640	3332640	So was George Washington.
3332640	3333640	He was younger.
3333640	3335240	When he was young, he couldn't tell a lie.
3335240	3337960	I can tell them.
3337960	3340680	I still have my teeth.
3340680	3342720	I could just slip at almost 45.
3342720	3346360	It's like a right age to just shut up and sneak away with your Trey Parker money and
3346360	3350440	just fucking make your cartoon, maybe write a Broadway play.
3350440	3351440	You're not going to do that, man.
3351440	3352720	You're not going to do that with your money, man.
3352720	3354840	You're going to use that money for better things.
3354840	3360480	And you're going to use that money, first of all, to shelter all of us in some kind
3361480	3362480	of beautiful compound somewhere.
3362480	3364200	I have $30,000 in my checking account.
3364200	3365480	That is not a lie.
3365480	3370560	I have spent all of my money on my shitty cartoon studio.
3370560	3375120	But I'm probably going to be a millionaire in a couple of weeks because it's just...
3375120	3376120	He looked at his watch.
3376120	3377120	He looked at his...
3377120	3384880	He looked at his fucking Apple iWatch because he has the stocks app.
3384880	3385880	Come on.
3385880	3386880	You have it in your cabinet?
3386880	3387880	Yeah.
3387880	3388880	I have my Tesla stocks going up.
3388880	3389880	I don't have a car, but I invested in Tesla.
3390280	3391880	Give him some credit.
3391880	3392880	Cody's still got Tesla...
3392880	3393880	Wait, wait.
3393880	3394880	Am I...
3394880	3395880	Is that illegal to tell...
3395880	3396880	No.
3396880	3397880	That's not inside your trading app.
3397880	3398880	I don't work at...
3398880	3399880	I don't know.
3399880	3400880	Cody's got Tesla stock.
3400880	3405880	It keeps going up, but it's weird when you have a stock in something.
3405880	3406880	You hear all these...
3406880	3407880	Whatever.
3407880	3408880	That's not an interesting topic.
3408880	3409880	How many stocks?
3409880	3410880	Three.
3410880	3411880	I don't...
3411880	3412880	What the fuck?
3412880	3418120	Also, you guys, Cody really likes Blue Bonnet and Santa Anita in the second race.
3418120	3419120	The Saturdays.
3419120	3420120	Blue Bonnet.
3420120	3426120	I got the horse right here, the neighbor's paw right there.
3426120	3427120	Sorry.
3427120	3429120	Wait, what were we talking about?
3429120	3430120	Fuck.
3430120	3431120	I'm sorry.
3431120	3432120	Fucking revolution, baby.
3432120	3433120	We're talking about revolution.
3433120	3438960	We're talking about the idea that at some point in history, whether you like it or not,
3438960	3439960	things change.
3439960	3440960	This is like...
3440960	3442480	It's no point in being ahistoric.
3442480	3449000	If you look at history itself, inevitably, black plagues, World War IIs, World War Is,
3449000	3455480	Vietnam's, things happen, shit changes, and when shit changes, then it's up to us,
3455480	3464080	the people, to do something about it and to not be so decimated by the reality of history,
3464080	3469600	which is that sometimes bad people get into office and do rotten fucking things, and our
3469600	3475240	job is not to pay attention to whatever the current laws of the land are.
3475240	3483040	Our job is to get a fucking catering license and to buy fucking as much nitrous oxide as
3483040	3484040	we can, man!
3484040	3485040	We gotta do it!
3485040	3490760	And I would also add, I would also add, if you're still at this late date using toilet
3490760	3496000	paper with Arab blood in it, stop doing that, you know, just get regular toilet paper.
3496000	3499360	It doesn't really affect the white.
3499360	3502960	It just irritates our allies and our enemies abroad.
3502960	3508840	Yeah, no, I mean, thank you.
3508840	3509840	It's good of you.
3509840	3512320	This is a good time to get this boost.
3512320	3513320	I mean, it's just...
3513320	3516680	Oh, it is, it's like you're running a marathon, like we've never...
3516680	3520400	We're very lucky, and realizing that we're lucky is exhausting.
3520400	3525360	That's how lucky we are, the strenuous realizing how lucky we are.
3525360	3526360	That's like hard work.
3526360	3531520	It's like when I do a little dance, when I rap, and then I'm like two days later, I'm
3531520	3535120	like out of breath, and my doctor's like, what have you done?
3535120	3538840	It's like you gotta start somewhere, and somewhere is like, holy shit, my whole body's like...
3538840	3539840	And that's what it is.
3539840	3548200	It's almost been a year, and not everybody's hitting exhaustion points at the same time.
3548200	3555160	I pulled into the Twitter pit stop thing and was like, I'm doing something wrong out there,
3555160	3558320	because I'm not really doing anything to...
3558320	3563560	I'm getting angry, and I'm like, for all I know, on some chart somewhere, I'm like actually
3563560	3567240	helping the bad guy, because I'm just sort of like driving and angry, and like screaming
3567240	3568240	around.
3568240	3571720	But it doesn't hurt that much to pull over for a second, and go like, okay, why am I
3571720	3572720	out there?
3572720	3573720	What am I doing?
3573720	3574720	Change the tires?
3574720	3577560	Go back out there with a fucking monster car.
3577560	3581600	Some crazy monster mobile or something that's like you assembled, because you like thought
3581600	3584640	about it for a second.
3584640	3585640	No promises there.
3585640	3591800	I'll probably just go back and promote Rick and Morty, but hey, you know, a guy like me
3591800	3592800	gets really rich.
3592800	3597520	I can always be one of those Casablanca guys that's like funding stuff under the table
3597520	3598520	or something.
3598520	3600520	Lots of people do that, man.
3600520	3603200	This venue could be like some kind of like...
3603200	3604200	Like Rick's Cafe?
3604200	3605200	Yeah, exactly.
3605200	3610640	I could just be like, come on, I don't do nothing, you're living alone, you Nazi goofs.
3611640	3616640	And then comic goes up and goes like, fuck, I don't think you should burn people because
3616640	3617640	they're not white.
3617640	3621640	And then they're like, how do you explain this observation comedy?
3621640	3625640	Hey, Reggie Watts does what he's going to do.
3625640	3626640	He's just...
3626640	3628640	That's hilarious.
3628640	3631640	He thinks off the top of his head, guys, you think they give me a script beforehand?
3631640	3632640	Why don't you be just a minute?
3632640	3633640	I feel...
3633640	3634640	I'm a gin and tonic.
3634640	3635640	Pardon me, Mr. Harmon.
3635640	3640640	Your impression of Humphrey Bogart is a little too New York Jew.
3640640	3644640	I feel like I kind of sound like that Nazi from the Vice video.
3644640	3645640	Man, the Jew.
3645640	3647640	See, I got to bring the Jews.
3647640	3649640	Except for a son of a lot of Jew.
3649640	3651640	I got the Jews and the blacks.
3651640	3653640	What was that guy doing?
3653640	3654640	He sound like Bob Hope.
3654640	3655640	All right.
3655640	3656640	Sorry, what were you...
3656640	3660640	I was going to say that you guys know Dr. Bronner's Soap, right?
3660640	3661640	Yeah.
3661640	3663640	So, yeah, what's really cool about them...
3664640	3665640	Dr. Bronner's Soap.
3665640	3666640	Dr. Bronner's Soap.
3666640	3667640	Dr. Bronner's Soap.
3667640	3668640	The shit they sell at, like...
3668640	3671640	The soap that has, like, a political treatise written on the back of it.
3671640	3672640	Yeah.
3672640	3674640	I know nothing about this, but continue.
3674640	3675640	It's fascinating.
3675640	3676640	The story's fascinating.
3676640	3682640	So, like, Dr. Bronner, Emmanuel Bronner, his entire family died in the Holocaust.
3682640	3689640	And he came to the United States and he, like, had this, like, vision, basically.
3689640	3691640	He had this, like, message that he wanted to send.
3691640	3695640	And he was, like, writing, I guess, little pamphlets that he was trying to give to people.
3695640	3697640	But he was also making soap.
3697640	3702640	And everybody wanted the soap, but nobody wanted the fucking pamphlet with the weird shit written on it.
3702640	3704640	So he realized, oh, I'll just put the fucking...
3704640	3706640	The things that I'm saying on the...
3706640	3707640	It's awesome.
3707640	3708640	On the soap.
3708640	3709640	It's pretty awesome.
3709640	3714640	So what's interesting about that family, the Bronner's family, is they put salary caps on themselves.
3714640	3718640	And then they give everything over that salary cap.
3718640	3719640	All right.
3719640	3720640	I don't like where this is going.
3720640	3721640	Where?
3721640	3722640	Where?
3722640	3723640	It's cool.
3723640	3724640	I have $30,000 in my checking account.
3724640	3725640	Come on.
3725640	3727640	I'm 44 years old.
3727640	3730640	So you're saying that you're getting, like, $30,000.
3730640	3731640	That's where you're at.
3731640	3735640	I'm saying when there's a million dollars in that account, I'm not going to put a cap on it yet.
3735640	3737640	I want to see if it can be too...
3737640	3738640	Just for a second.
3738640	3739640	But you could...
3739640	3745640	The point is, like, the moment you do start, like, figuring out ways to, like, harness
3745640	3749640	money energy and not using it just for yourself, you can start doing shit.
3749640	3752640	Like, what they do is they give money to, like, psychedelic therapy.
3752640	3757640	They've given, I think, over a million dollars to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic
3757640	3760640	Studies just to work on MDMA with PTSD.
3760640	3762640	And they give money to all kinds of groups like that.
3762640	3769640	So the point is, like, one form of being revolutionary is actually using your talent to get a bunch
3769640	3770640	of dough.
3770640	3776640	And then instead of keeping that money, giving that money to implicitly subversive organizations
3776640	3780640	that are going to, like, transform society in their own way.
3780640	3784640	That's how you really would start creating cool ripples, you know?
3784640	3785640	There's also...
3785640	3788640	Give your money away, you pig!
3788640	3791640	Tell him to give his money away, people!
3791640	3793640	Take it from him!
3793640	3794640	I'll tweet his address.
3794640	3796640	You can go to his house.
3796640	3799640	He just told us in a week he's going to be a millionaire.
3799640	3803640	Can I be one for a week then after that?
3803640	3805640	Do you know how long I've been waiting?
3805640	3806640	18 TV shows.
3806640	3807640	How do you have $30,000?
3807640	3809640	I'm paying for all of them!
3809640	3813640	You think when you go pitch a show and they say, we'll take it, they give you money?
3813640	3814640	They take money!
3814640	3816640	You have to go develop the show now.
3816640	3818640	It's a fucked up business, man.
3818640	3821640	I did a really dumb thing opening a studio.
3821640	3823640	It's like opening a restaurant.
3823640	3825640	It's like, wait, what are you doing?
3825640	3827640	You don't see any other restaurants around here?
3827640	3828640	What are you trying to be?
3828640	3829640	Sony?
3829640	3830640	You fucking moron?
3830640	3831640	They owe people money.
3831640	3834640	They're Sony!
3834640	3839640	The studios report a loss every year.
3839640	3841640	But along the way, I've hooked up with some cool people.
3841640	3845640	Not hooked up in the millennial sense.
3845640	3851640	I've met some cool people and I like to think there will be shows now coming that I'm excited
3851640	3856640	about that maybe wouldn't have existed if I didn't go put my big pumpkin on the table,
3856640	3860640	TBS, and go like, plus I'll be there!
3860640	3863640	Aren't you making that big Rick and Morty money?
3863640	3866640	That's why I'm going to be a millionaire soon.
3866640	3867640	Can I see your watch?
3867640	3869640	What do you have on there?
3869640	3870640	What does it say?
3870640	3871640	An alert?
3871640	3872640	It's just a pentagram.
3872640	3875640	Come here.
3875640	3879640	This keeps looking at a pentagram.
3879640	3880640	What is that?
3880640	3882640	A minute ago it was 9-11.
3882640	3885640	That's just 9-12.
3885640	3889640	You're one of those guests that they gave the ultimate compliment to.
3889640	3891640	9-11 came and they didn't say anything.
3891640	3892640	They kind of did.
3892640	3895640	We were making noise at the time.
3895640	3897640	What kind of noise?
3897640	3902640	General Cheers.
3902640	3903640	General Cheers.
3903640	3911640	General Cheers for Point of Duty.
3911640	3912640	How's your testicle?
3912640	3913640	You beat cancer.
3913640	3916640	Still gone.
3916640	3921640	Do you still have to go in every six months and make sure they're not coming back or anything?
3921640	3926640	They eventually just go year free and clear or do they just keep lengthening?
3926640	3928640	You can make a decision about that.
3928640	3930640	You can make the decision based on statistics.
3930640	3932640	You can go in for a certain number of scans.
3932640	3934640	You can go in for a bunch of scans.
3934640	3936640	You can go in for as many as you want.
3936640	3945640	Every scan you go for, they're looking at your body to see if the thing is spreading.
3945640	3950640	At one point I realized I just don't want to keep getting fucking MRIs.
3950640	3961640	I'm just going to see what happens and if I die, then I'm going to die of that, I guess.
3961640	3964640	So far I feel great and everything is fine.
3964640	3966640	If I kick the bucket, forgive me.
3966640	3967640	I told that to him.
3967640	3968640	I'm sorry.
3968640	3971640	If you kick the bucket, the general rule is you're forgiven.
3971640	3973640	Not all the time.
3973640	3975640	Just a couple of people.
3975640	3978640	Everyone just kind of spits.
3978640	3982640	The way cancer really fucked me up was not the physical stuff.
3982640	3984640	The physical stuff sucks.
3984640	3987640	The way it fucks you up is it teaches you about impermanence.
3987640	3993640	That's a really rough thing because it's like we live in a society that doesn't really understand impermanence.
3993640	4000640	I remember before cancer, I'll go and look at my podcast before cancer and I'll just think about the way I was before cancer.
4000640	4003640	It's awesome because you're like running around.
4003640	4006640	You're like, I'm fucking going to live forever.
4006640	4008640	You're reading Ray Kurzweil.
4008640	4013640	You're like, shit, man, I think I really might be one of the people who live to be a thousand.
4013640	4016640	They're going to turn rocks into computers in 2040.
4016640	4017640	You believe it.
4017640	4029640	So what's really funny about fucking cancer is it does the exact same thing to you that the IRS does your bank account because everybody has a temporal bank account.
4030640	4038640	If you haven't really tasted death, you probably have a bank account filled with all these years.
4038640	4043640	You run around acting like a fucking trust fund kid because you're like, man, I got this bank account.
4043640	4045640	It's fucking stocked with years.
4045640	4046640	You go to the ATM.
4046640	4048640	You're like, look at all those fucking years, man.
4048640	4050640	That's awesome.
4050640	4052640	I've fucking got so many years.
4052640	4063640	And then when you get cancer, you're like, oh, fuck, I might overdraft.
4063640	4066640	I owe 40 years.
4066640	4067640	Yeah.
4067640	4076640	And what that does to you is simultaneously, obviously tragic, but one of the most beautiful gifts of all time.
4076640	4088640	Because what it gives you is this like incredible connection with the now because you're like, you realize like, oh, my God, this big fucking lie about how long I think I'm going to live or how long people think they're going to live.
4088640	4090640	This is just another fucking lie, man.
4090640	4093640	They want you to believe you're going to live to 70, 80 years.
4093640	4104640	Because if you believe that and you start investing in like 401Ks and responsible living and you're going to be like, but really, the reality of it is is like lots of you aren't going to live past tonight.
4104640	4110640	And this is fucking.
4110640	4114640	And there are no doors.
4114640	4115640	That's a cheap joke.
4115640	4120640	Of course, there's always my way.
4120640	4129640	Yeah, I watched a Jones House documentary and I realized what they did wrong is they didn't just have the used Kool-Aid.
4129640	4132640	They didn't just have an open bar.
4132640	4136640	So good night.
4136640	4137640	Would have been so much easier for him.
4137640	4141640	You know, you hear those Jones House recordings and you're like, dude, why didn't you just.
4141640	4145640	Jesus, if you really want these people dead that bad and you don't have to do this soft shoe.
4145640	4146640	Yeah, just kill him.
4146640	4147640	My God.
4147640	4148640	He had to do so much explaining.
4148640	4150640	He's like, come on, don't cry.
4150640	4151640	It's going to be okay.
4151640	4152640	The line.
4152640	4153640	You're just dying.
4153640	4154640	That's all.
4154640	4155640	The line that gets to me.
4155640	4158640	This is the line that gets to me.
4158640	4162640	Mothers, mothers, mothers, stop your children from crying.
4162640	4165640	We are merely crossing over to the other side.
4165640	4166640	Them first.
4166640	4167640	Yeah.
4167640	4168640	They can't do you.
4168640	4169640	Yeah.
4169640	4172640	That is fucking insane.
4172640	4176640	I know somebody who's.
4176640	4177640	Wait, who was he just talking to?
4177640	4183640	He was like working on a Jonestown thing and like, God, now my mind is such a fucking fart.
4183640	4184640	Anyways.
4184640	4189640	But yeah, if there's docu I mean, like, I'm not recommending you go to a horrible place,
4189640	4190640	but it's okay.
4190640	4191640	I guess, you know what?
4191640	4194640	Watch the Ken Burns Vietnam thing too, because I'm going to, because that's one of the things
4194640	4198640	too, is like not to normalize what's happening now, but it actually is a little uplifting
4198640	4201640	to remember or rather know.
4201640	4203640	I was a little child in 19.
4203640	4204640	I was a baby in 1973.
4204640	4209640	So, but it's like they were fucking like, there's a lot of parallels, like just in terms of
4209640	4210640	the national psyche.
4211640	4218640	People back then were as groovy as they were because they too, like us, felt like every
4218640	4221640	day could be the last day of America.
4221640	4223640	And they really felt that that's what was at stake.
4223640	4225640	They had a lot of reasons to feel that way.
4225640	4230640	And yeah, and I just watched Network again too, which is taking place at that time.
4230640	4232640	And their background shows.
4232640	4235640	Network is kind of a gay romp.
4235640	4239640	The jokes that they're doing in the background about how, you know, President Ford's life
4239640	4240640	has been threatened by this or that.
4240640	4243640	They're kind of like, they're just setting the time and place.
4243640	4246640	It's like, oh God, yeah, we were, the 70s were like a crazy time.
4246640	4247640	Sure.
4247640	4249640	It's not, it's not to say that it's not to normalize.
4249640	4251640	It says, feel a sisterhood with the 70s.
4251640	4252640	Watch the Ken Burns thing.
4252640	4253640	Or watch that.
4253640	4257640	There's a great documentary on the weather underground that you should watch.
4257640	4258640	It's really fucking cool.
4258640	4260640	And these, these guys, they're.
4260640	4261640	Yeah.
4261640	4262640	You know what else you should watch?
4263640	4265640	Spider-Man.
4266640	4268640	Something by Jane Austen or something.
4269640	4270640	No, they're, they're.
4272640	4273640	You guys are dumb.
4274640	4275640	You guys are dumb.
4275640	4276640	You guys are watching stuff.
4276640	4277640	You're not dumb.
4277640	4278640	But you should watch.
4278640	4279640	What were you watching?
4279640	4280640	You know, Guardians 2.
4280640	4281640	Yeah.
4283640	4284640	Jane Austen didn't write it.
4286640	4287640	I finally saw Guardians 2.
4287640	4288640	I really liked it.
4288640	4289640	Was it good?
4289640	4292640	Because I famously kind of, I think I may have let it slip.
4292640	4296640	I didn't get the, I didn't get the fucking hysteria about Guardians 1.
4296640	4297640	I liked it.
4297640	4300640	And so I put off watching Guardians 2 for a long time because I was like, these people
4300640	4302640	are nuts about the Guardians thing.
4302640	4305640	And so I'll just, I don't want to watch the sequel because I felt like there were
4305640	4308640	just so many purple people yelling and like I couldn't tell the difference between
4308640	4309640	any of the characters.
4309640	4310640	And like Rocket Raccoon.
4310640	4311640	Sounds like DMT.
4311640	4315640	Rocket Raccoon deserves more than to have a camera push on him and then say yeah.
4315640	4317640	Like that's not, that's not clever.
4317640	4319640	Like the camera pushes us and you don't, you say more than yeah.
4319640	4321640	And so I was like, I didn't, I wasn't, I wasn't like, I was like, I don't care.
4321640	4324640	This movie isn't like citizen game.
4324640	4326640	So I watched the second one.
4326640	4328640	I was like, oh man, I love this Drax guy.
4328640	4329640	He's so great.
4329640	4330640	Like I love this Raccoon.
4330640	4331640	I was like, this is really cool.
4331640	4333640	Wasn't Steve Agee in the second one?
4333640	4334640	Yeah, yeah, he was.
4334640	4335640	Which I forgot.
4335640	4336640	And then all of a sudden Steve Agee's just like.
4336640	4337640	That's so badass.
4337640	4338640	Amazing.
4338640	4339640	Yeah.
4339640	4340640	Yeah.
4340640	4341640	Yeah.
4341640	4342640	That's great.
4342640	4344640	That's what, that's what, if the apocalypse needed to happen for Steve Agee to be in
4344640	4345640	Marvel movies.
4345640	4346640	Yeah.
4346640	4347640	Fine.
4347640	4348640	I'll take it.
4348640	4349640	I'd love to be around Steve Agee in the apocalypse.
4349640	4351640	I'd love to be around Steve Agee to be in every Marvel movie from now on.
4351640	4352640	I hope so.
4352640	4353640	You look great.
4353640	4356640	I haven't seen it yet, but like the stills I've seen, he looks fucking awesome.
4356640	4357640	Yeah.
4357640	4358640	No, he fit.
4358640	4359640	Yeah.
4359640	4360640	Yeah.
4360640	4361640	He's a little space pirate.
4361640	4362640	Oh, but the weather underground.
4362640	4365640	Not to be like too preachy or something, but like definitely check it out because it's
4365640	4367640	cool because it's the weather underground.
4367640	4371640	Like Obama would actually get in trouble because he was friends with one of the members, but
4371640	4373640	their motto was bring the war back home.
4373640	4378640	So they, they, they actually decided that they were going to start blowing up buildings
4378640	4379640	and they did.
4379640	4382640	And the way they did it is they would call the building and make sure no one was there
4382640	4385640	because they didn't want them to get killed.
4385640	4392640	But it was an example of an American revolutionary movement that was like maybe a little fueled
4392640	4393640	by psychedelics.
4393640	4397640	Like there's just like in the documentary, they talk about being in their van, no nitrous,
4397640	4403640	but like just being in the van, they're all like having an orgy in a van as they're driving
4404640	4410640	to like put explosives in a government building to blow up, to protest the Vietnam war.
4410640	4416640	And when you look at that and, and we're like, just throw your moral compass away.
4416640	4423640	So just when you look at that, you realize how great people really are because you really,
4423640	4425640	because you realize like these, these people don't need to do that.
4425640	4427640	They could just fucking ignore the Vietnam war.
4427640	4432640	Like anybody else, they could just ignore it, ignore it, go to your job.
4432640	4434640	We're all doing fine, man.
4434640	4436640	We're fine.
4436640	4437640	You guys have money.
4437640	4438640	I don't know how much you have.
4438640	4439640	You have a little bit.
4439640	4440640	You're not star.
4440640	4441640	We're fine.
4441640	4443640	So it's easy to ignore, which is what they want.
4443640	4447640	So it's kind of cool when people are like, fuck this, we're not ignoring anymore.
4447640	4451640	And then they go to this extreme place, which I have obviously not advocating anyway,
4451640	4454640	but still it represents what can be done.
4454640	4458640	And it's a really inspirational thing to watch because you realize like, shit, man,
4458640	4461640	we could be doing a lot more than we're doing.
4461640	4463640	You know, we can be doing lots, lots more.
4463640	4464640	And if we all start doing lots...
4464640	4465640	You could also build a birdhouse.
4465640	4467640	You don't have to blow anything up.
4467640	4468640	You could blow up a birdhouse.
4468640	4470640	There were a lot less people in the world back then.
4470640	4472640	There was probably an easier...
4472640	4473640	In the Vietnam War?
4473640	4475640	It was easier to blow up a building with no one in it.
4475640	4476640	I would say these days...
4476640	4477640	I'm not saying blow up buildings.
4477640	4479640	I'm not advocating like that level of violence.
4479640	4485640	But, and also like in the, and I will admit this, like when the Antifa started punching people,
4485640	4490640	I was definitely like having conversations like, you know, I think they've gone too far.
4490640	4494640	But like one of the things, then I started like researching them a little bit.
4494640	4498640	And this will get me in trouble on the internet because anytime you like do any kind of like emphasis,
4498640	4500640	I'm like, maybe they're not so bad.
4500640	4503640	You will immediately get like a bunch of tweets like, you fucking idiot.
4503640	4505640	Do you know what you've done?
4505640	4506640	Well, I'm not on Twitter.
4506640	4508640	Maybe Antifa is not so bad.
4508640	4510640	Like very happy to say that.
4510640	4512640	Well, one of the cool things that they...
4512640	4515640	Oh, maybe some of them are here.
4515640	4518640	One of the cool things that they say or one of the cool...
4518640	4521640	You know, so people break windows in these protests.
4521640	4526640	And they break these windows and people are like, how could you break windows of local businesses?
4526640	4531640	And Antifa, they call those people window protectors.
4531640	4533640	They're like, oh, you want to protect windows?
4533640	4536640	That's what you're worried about, fucking windows?
4536640	4538640	Maybe we can form an alliance at some point.
4538640	4540640	In my world, all the windows are going to break.
4540640	4542640	Yes, exactly.
4542640	4545640	The ones that aren't broken will be polished by Nazis.
4545640	4549640	So I'm breaking a couple windows to keep you talking or whatever.
4549640	4551640	I'm not going to justify their stuff.
4551640	4562640	I'm just, as I said on your podcast, I'm just so fucking grateful that not all kids are just...
4562640	4564640	All kids are hooligans, right?
4564640	4572640	So I'm so grateful to my hooligan kids who are like, I'm going to be a hooligan today.
4572640	4574640	Where do I direct my hooliganism?
4574640	4579640	Towards the man, towards Nazis.
4579640	4584640	If they didn't do that, then we'd be extra fucked.
4584640	4587640	I'm definitely going to complain about them last.
4587640	4591640	I will admit, man, I did complain about them in the beginning.
4591640	4594640	Anybody in Antifa listening, I'm sorry.
4594640	4595640	They don't forgive.
4595640	4598640	So I guess they're going to hate me.
4598640	4601640	I want to have someone from Antifa.
4601640	4603640	Isn't that kind of a silly thing?
4603640	4605640	They don't have like a letterhead, right?
4605640	4606640	I think they're decentralized.
4606640	4608640	We've got somebody from Antifa here.
4608640	4609640	Steve Levy to stage.
4609640	4611640	Steve Levy going up here.
4611640	4614640	Are you serious?
4614640	4618640	He's the spokesman for the Burbank chapter of Antifa.
4618640	4622640	I want to have also, just for anybody listening who cares about this stuff,
4622640	4625640	who's like the platform and all this stuff and how you're using it.
4625640	4629640	I had Gotham girl come on, she's an Eleanor Democrat.
4629640	4632640	She talked about believing in the system and the election was fraudulent.
4633640	4639640	I wanted her to have her signal boosted for that reason.
4639640	4643640	I also want to have, therefore, somebody from the DSA,
4643640	4647640	people have been tweeting me and stuff, and somebody from Antifa.
4647640	4651640	You guys have always been so kind.
4651640	4656640	I want to sprinkle those folks in because it's like turbulent times.
4656640	4661640	I just wanted to say that out loud so you didn't think that I was biased.
4661640	4664640	Well, I don't care if I'm biased.
4664640	4665640	I don't know anything.
4665640	4666640	I don't know enough.
4666640	4670640	I want to have people on that talk about what to do because I don't know what to do.
4670640	4673640	So I want to talk to the people that are like,
4673640	4676640	I don't care if they're doing shit that's ugly, whatever.
4676640	4677640	I want to talk to them.
4677640	4678640	All right.
4678640	4682640	Anyways, what?
4682640	4683640	What?
4683640	4684640	Nothing.
4684640	4685640	How are you doing, Levy?
4685640	4686640	How's things?
4686640	4687640	Things are good.
4687640	4688640	Yeah?
4688640	4689640	Yeah.
4689640	4690640	Last time I saw you a couple weeks ago, you were a little down on the dumps.
4690640	4691640	Yeah.
4691640	4692640	You know, it happens.
4692640	4693640	Why?
4693640	4696640	Now why do people get down on the dumps?
4696640	4697640	What happened?
4697640	4700640	Oh, I guess I have my heart broken.
4700640	4702640	That's the worst.
4702640	4703640	Here we go.
4703640	4705640	Here we go again.
4705640	4706640	Oh, boy.
4706640	4708640	I guess I had my heart broken.
4708640	4711640	Can you talk about what happened?
4711640	4716640	Well, you know hearts.
4716640	4717640	Yeah.
4718640	4724640	An old friend of mine, we started seeing each other for the first time, really,
4724640	4726640	and trying to make it work.
4726640	4727640	She was in New York.
4727640	4732640	And we were seeing each other back and forth for a little bit.
4732640	4737640	And then the last time I saw her, we parted ways.
4737640	4738640	Yeah.
4738640	4743640	Because you guys went there after a lifetime of childhood sweethearty...
4743640	4744640	Yeah.
4744640	4745640	...Fox and the Hound shit.
4746640	4750640	I guess, as you would say, we had a real will-they-won't-they.
4750640	4751640	Right.
4751640	4752640	Yeah.
4752640	4756640	And then now the question has been answered and they won't.
4758640	4759640	You don't know that.
4759640	4760640	Things change.
4760640	4761640	Well, no.
4761640	4762640	I do know that.
4762640	4763640	That's what he's seeing happen.
4763640	4764640	I'm not trying to...
4764640	4765640	It could change.
4765640	4766640	Yeah.
4766640	4770640	Well, after all those years, I guess they will and now they won't.
4770640	4771640	Right.
4771640	4772640	Well, they did.
4772640	4773640	They did.
4773640	4774640	They did.
4774640	4775640	Now they don't.
4775640	4776640	They didn't.
4776640	4777640	Wait, no.
4777640	4780640	Now it's more of a did-they-don't-they.
4780640	4781640	No, they didn't.
4781640	4782640	They did.
4782640	4783640	Now they're not.
4783640	4784640	But they might again.
4784640	4785640	Now...
4785640	4787640	Is there a might-they-could-they or not?
4787640	4788640	I don't know.
4788640	4789640	And I don't want to...
4789640	4790640	This is...
4790640	4791640	I'm a totally unbiased objective observer.
4791640	4794640	I have no agenda about setting you up or wingmanning you or anything.
4794640	4795640	I just...
4795640	4799140	I heard through the grapevine that the reason it didn't work, she complained about something
4799140	4803640	like your penis was naturally ribbed and...
4803640	4806640	Yeah, I heard that, too.
4806640	4807640	It's giant.
4807640	4808640	And then it was not...
4808640	4809640	It was self-lubricating.
4809640	4812640	And it vibrated.
4812640	4813640	That's what I heard.
4813640	4816640	I heard this crazy thing like you can't control how fast it vibrates.
4816640	4818640	She didn't like that it happened.
4818640	4821640	It also had a little prong that came out, which is right on the clip.
4821640	4822640	Yeah.
4822640	4823640	Is that true, man?
4823640	4824640	It's a curse.
4824640	4825640	It's shaped like a rabbit.
4825640	4826640	Yeah.
4826640	4827640	Right on the top.
4827640	4828640	There was like a...
4828640	4832640	Right on the back of the helmet, there's like a pair of rabbit ears that come out and go
4832640	4833640	like that.
4833640	4837640	You got a crazy cock, man.
4837640	4842640	A little too crazy for some unlucky woman.
4842640	4855640	Some girls aren't ready for the perfect cock, because that's what we're finding out.
4855640	4860360	Didn't your dick just come back from Texas where it was helping move sandbags for flood
4860360	4861360	victims?
4862360	4863360	I thought it was Puerto Rico.
4863360	4865360	With Ryan Gosling and...
4867360	4872360	I thought the problem was whenever there was a disaster in the world, your cock would detach
4872360	4874360	and fly to the disaster.
4874360	4877360	His balls are right now are restoring cell service in Puerto Rico.
4879360	4880360	Oh, can I ask...
4880360	4881360	I want to tell...
4881360	4882360	I had an...
4882360	4886360	Look, I have a cum question.
4886360	4887360	Like, I was like...
4887360	4888360	Yes.
4889360	4890360	Don't you think...
4890360	4892360	I was telling Cody, because I was like hungover...
4892360	4895360	I'm not going to share my...
4895360	4899360	You guys don't want to picture me having sex, but I was having this conversation where I
4899360	4900360	was like...
4900360	4901360	I just...
4901360	4902360	I made some observation where I was like...
4902360	4903360	I was like...
4903360	4909360	I was like, don't you think it takes a lot of water to result in a load of cum?
4909360	4910360	It dehydrates you?
4910360	4912360	And she was like, what are you talking about?
4912360	4914360	It's as much water as there is...
4914360	4915360	I'm like, no, it's not like a recipe.
4915360	4916360	You don't like put a little bit of...
4916360	4921360	Your body doesn't put a little bit of water in your balls and then put a little bit of
4921360	4923360	sperm powder and...
4923360	4925360	There's a process...
4925360	4930360	Don't you think it takes a certain amount of water and a certain amount of sandwiches?
4930360	4931360	How many...
4932360	4939360	What do you think in a load of ejaculate, which is like...
4939360	4942360	I think it's like 100 million sperm are in a jacket.
4942360	4945360	So there's this whole process that, you know, sperm...
4945360	4948360	I just read it's 1.2 terabytes of data.
4949360	4950360	Wait, shut up.
4950360	4952360	Wait, I actually did see this too.
4952360	4953360	Wait, wait, wait.
4953360	4954360	You mean genetically?
4954360	4955360	Yeah, genetically.
4955360	4956360	The DNA in a sperm equals...
4956360	4959360	It was like one sperm is equivalent to 35 megabytes.
4959360	4961360	I don't know if it's really...
4961360	4962360	It's 1.2 terabytes.
4962360	4965360	One sperm is half the information it takes to make a person.
4965360	4967360	How much data is in a person's DNA?
4967360	4969360	I expect it to be more than 1.2 terabytes.
4969360	4971360	It's amazing that it's just 1.2 terabytes.
4971360	4975360	Doesn't it imply that a full human being is 2.4 terabytes?
4975360	4979360	No, it implies when you're downloading stuff into your computer it's having an orgasm.
4979360	4980360	Sorry.
4981360	4982360	Say what?
4984360	4985360	What is it?
4985360	4990360	We have either a computer science major or a chronic masturbator.
4991360	4993360	The two can happen together.
4993360	4994360	I don't know which it could be.
4994360	4996360	The two can happen at once, Dan.
4996360	4998360	It's impossible for it to be both.
4999360	5002360	You're saying it's 124 terabytes.
5002360	5004360	Are you correcting the data of the sperm?
5004360	5005360	124 terabytes?
5005360	5006360	Yeah, right.
5006360	5015360	Just so you know, I did my doctoral thesis on college cum and it's 1.2.
5016360	5017360	Okay.
5017360	5018360	Well, that's...
5018360	5020360	I mean, that really is like we're coming up on the...
5020360	5022360	I mean, because the...
5022360	5024360	They're coming up on the...
5024360	5027360	So we're getting close to like, you know...
5027360	5028360	Well, wait.
5028360	5029360	Well, we have peta...
5029360	5030360	What is it?
5030360	5031360	Petabytes is next?
5031360	5033360	That's the next highest thing.
5033360	5035360	Obviously we have the...
5035360	5036360	Whatever.
5036360	5037360	We've mapped the human genome.
5037360	5038360	What am I?
5038360	5039360	My grandpa?
5040360	5042360	I'm just saying like pretty soon teleportation, man.
5042360	5044360	Once you can store everything.
5044360	5047360	Teleportation is bad news, man.
5047360	5051360	You know about like once you teleport you're dead, you know?
5051360	5053360	I mean that philosophical thing.
5053360	5055360	That's true, though.
5057360	5058360	I can't prove it.
5058360	5060360	I can't prove it's me.
5060360	5061360	Yeah.
5061360	5063360	Let me ask you this.
5063360	5066360	If you could, if you could pick...
5066360	5068360	Like, so you got to fly across the country.
5068360	5070360	And if you could pick...
5070360	5072360	Teleportation.
5072360	5074360	But you've got to get kicked in the balls.
5075360	5076360	Or like flying on an airplane.
5076360	5077360	What do you pick?
5077360	5080360	I never want to teleport because it'll be...
5080360	5083360	That's like going in a suicide booth.
5084360	5085360	It kills you.
5085360	5087360	That would be the amazing thing when they invent teleportation.
5087360	5089360	Eventually there will be a society, I think we'll be dead,
5089360	5092360	but there will be this like concept of like virgins.
5092360	5094360	You know, people who haven't been teleported.
5094360	5095360	That's right.
5095360	5096360	And people will start saying like...
5096360	5097360	Like me.
5097360	5098360	You should talk to Gary.
5098360	5102360	When Gary talks you can kind of sense that he's using the cells that he was born with.
5102360	5104360	Yeah, because we can't even fucking print.
5104360	5106360	I only date teleporters.
5106360	5107360	Black and white ink.
5107360	5109360	We can't print anything without fucking errors.
5109360	5112360	You think we can print people back out of a fucking...
5112360	5113360	Not yet!
5113360	5115360	You can't even copy a fucking JPEG.
5115360	5116360	No, we'll be so fucked.
5116360	5117360	Yeah, yeah.
5117360	5118360	For sure.
5118360	5120360	In your brain it's like you come out and you're like,
5120360	5121360	I don't know Spanish anymore.
5121360	5124360	And it's like, that's if you're lucky.
5124360	5125360	You'll be so fucked.
5125360	5128360	And you know who's going to say, you never knew Spanish?
5128360	5130360	The fucking dipshit that works behind the teleporter.
5130360	5131360	Yeah.
5131360	5133360	That's teleported himself a million times a day.
5133360	5136360	And he's just like, no, it's great.
5136360	5140360	But you're assuming the mechanism of teleportation is based on the disintegration,
5140360	5142360	reintegration of the human, like, atomic structure.
5142360	5144360	What if it's some kind of like...
5144360	5145360	Like worm-like...
5145360	5146360	...tesseract.
5146360	5147360	What if it's the kind of...
5147360	5148360	No, I'm down with that.
5148360	5150360	So yeah, it's cool.
5150360	5151360	It's got teleporting.
5151360	5153360	That's what's scary.
5153360	5154360	Yeah, no.
5154360	5155360	I mean, I know.
5155360	5157360	Oh, portals, like walking through a door into another place.
5157360	5158360	Yeah, that's different.
5158360	5159360	Yeah, great.
5159360	5160360	That's safer.
5160360	5161360	Have you read Ringworld?
5161360	5162360	No, no.
5162360	5163360	It's great.
5163360	5165360	But Ringworld's super cool because it's like Larry Niven
5165360	5167360	and it's like way in the fucking future.
5167360	5170360	But in this world, there is teleportation.
5170360	5172360	I don't know if it's like bending the time-space continuum
5172360	5177360	or like destroying your atomic self and reintegrating it or whatever.
5177360	5182360	But what's interesting about it is like there's no such thing as like any one city.
5182360	5189360	All cities have become one massive city because there's no longer any kind of like distance
5189360	5190360	between cities.
5190360	5196360	So what happens on this like super futuristic Earth, which is really cool,
5196360	5200360	and also they've gotten to the level where they can like change their skin pigment.
5200360	5204360	So suddenly the fashions on the planet change like day to day
5204360	5206360	because everyone's so super connected.
5206360	5210360	So like one day, people will just start glowing
5210360	5214360	or like certain like star patterns will appear in people's faces and stuff
5214360	5216360	because they've become so interconnected that like...
5216360	5217360	I guess I'm pity.
5217360	5221360	I'm just like, come on, that's not imaginative.
5221360	5223360	What the fuck, Carmen?
5223360	5224360	Yeah, no, I'm listening.
5224360	5227360	I'm like, oh yeah, cities get bigger and then they all turn into one big city.
5227360	5228360	Did you think of it?
5228360	5229360	And then everybody can change their skin.
5229360	5230360	I'm like, come on.
5230360	5231360	Did you think of it?
5231360	5232360	You didn't think of it?
5232360	5235360	Well, I didn't bother.
5235360	5236360	Wait a minute.
5236360	5241360	I was thinking of crazier shit, man.
5241360	5246360	I was like, what if a sandwich could make you cum?
5248360	5250360	By the way, man, when you were talking about that,
5250360	5254360	it was really funny because I kept thinking of like an awesome cooking show.
5254360	5256360	You got hungry, that's what you're saying.
5256360	5261360	Where God's like, today we're going to be whipping up just basic cum.
5261360	5265360	We're going to make three club sandwiches, two gallons of water.
5265360	5270360	We're going to put it into Tyler and we're going to wait 20 days.
5270360	5276360	On a very special episode of Chop Junior.
5276360	5277360	But that's all I'm saying.
5277360	5279360	You have to take in all this water.
5279360	5282360	We were talking about the biological process, spermatogenesis.
5282360	5288360	By the way, I learned also, I started doing this thing where I'm like researching cum a lot.
5292360	5299360	After I masturbate and or have sex, and or intentional, sex with me is weird.
5299360	5303360	But sometimes you're laying there and you're like, man, I don't know if I'll ever get out of bed.
5303360	5305360	And then that's why I get out my iPad.
5305360	5307360	I'm like, tell me how sperm is made.
5307360	5312360	Because then I think like, if I watch it, then I'm like, maybe the sperm will start getting made
5312360	5315360	and then I can get out of bed.
5315360	5317360	It doesn't make any sense.
5317360	5320360	Your mobility is sperm based?
5320360	5321360	Well, I don't know.
5321360	5322360	I'm like a caveman.
5322360	5324360	When I'm in that mode, I'm like, I don't know.
5324360	5328360	The only scientific thing that I know is different is that I came a bunch
5328360	5330360	and now I can't get out of bed.
5331360	5337360	I knew somebody who worked in porn and they were on a set when Peter North finished a scene.
5337360	5343360	Peter North, who's famous for coming a bunch, he finished coming and I was like,
5343360	5345360	so what does he do after he finishes?
5345360	5348360	I asked the person, you watched Peter North come.
5348360	5350360	What happens after?
5350360	5352360	He has four piña coladas.
5352360	5354360	He said Peter North.
5354360	5358360	He turns into a little boy and he goes like, oh man, I need some cereal.
5359360	5362360	Wow, that's awesome.
5362360	5364360	It's so dirt-digler.
5364360	5367360	He's like Jethro Bodine.
5367360	5371360	Who are we going to trust if not him?
5371360	5373360	Some kind of comologist?
5373360	5376360	Maybe Peter North is, maybe he's just joyfully wrong,
5376360	5378360	but maybe he's expertly right.
5378360	5381360	He's just eating fucking frosted mini wheats and milk
5381360	5384360	because it kind of reminds him of cum when he looks at it.
5384360	5387360	He's like, that must make cum.
5387360	5389360	I've got to cum more later.
5389360	5391360	Somebody told me it was Golden Graham.
5391360	5392360	That was his thing.
5392360	5394360	He liked Golden Graham cereal.
5394360	5397360	That was his Popeye spinach.
5397360	5400360	I love the idea that it's just based on the milk,
5400360	5403360	but I swear like sometimes, you know, when you come a lot,
5403360	5406360	don't you sometimes you go like, man, I kind of, this has been great.
5406360	5410360	I love this feeling, but also like, can I get some motivation back?
5410360	5412360	Can I start living in denial again?
5412360	5413360	What am I going to do to do that?
5413360	5416360	And you think like, well, the refractory period must be based on like,
5416360	5420360	your balls start, I just have to assume that your balls start making,
5420360	5421360	I don't know.
5421360	5423360	You know the idea about the refractory period?
5423360	5426360	It's really, really, you had Chris Ryan on the show before.
5426360	5427360	Yeah.
5427360	5430360	So one of the ideas about the refractory period is that
5430360	5433360	from an evolutionary perspective,
5433360	5436360	it's better for a woman to have multiple mates.
5436360	5440360	So like, because then the strongest sperm is going to survive.
5440360	5441360	That's so fucked up.
5441360	5442360	That's why I don't want rom coms.
5442360	5443360	That's the...
5443360	5447360	Because there's like that height of romance.
5447360	5449360	But I know it's probably true, though, because it's like,
5449360	5450360	I've read stuff like...
5450360	5454360	You're making love to your lover in the primordial past.
5454360	5455360	You're making love.
5455360	5457360	You come inside of her.
5457360	5458360	You're like, I love you.
5458360	5459360	I'm going to go to bed.
5459360	5461360	And then you like start going to bed.
5461360	5464360	And then your friend is like, can I start fucking her now?
5464360	5467360	And either you're like, yeah, man, more than there.
5467360	5469360	Or she's like, yeah, let's do it or not.
5469360	5471360	Or she's tippy toeing out.
5471360	5474360	Yeah, so the idea is the refractory period
5474360	5477360	is actually designed to make sure that a...
5477360	5478360	Because the question is like...
5478360	5479360	Wait, so what was that?
5479360	5480360	Why are multiple...
5480360	5481360	Why can women have multiple orgasms in a man?
5481360	5482360	Why are multiple mates important, though?
5482360	5483360	What does that...
5483360	5485360	So the idea is like, if you had some kind of like,
5485360	5487360	I don't know, something was going on with you
5487360	5492360	and you weren't like making like powerful loads,
5492360	5493360	whatever that may be.
5493360	5495360	In a crazy like, what if...
5495360	5496360	What is the question?
5496360	5498360	It's like, why would it be?
5498360	5499360	The big question...
5499360	5500360	There's a Golden Graham shortage.
5500360	5505360	I go for two weeks, I come back to the Jizz Show.
5505360	5506360	I love talking about cum.
5506360	5507360	But the question...
5507360	5508360	I really do.
5508360	5511360	You got to go on Cum Town.
5511360	5513360	Cum Town.
5513360	5517360	The question is, a woman can have multiple orgasms with a...
5517360	5518360	That's not true.
5518360	5521360	That's not true.
5521360	5523360	That's a myth.
5523360	5526360	We'll be right back.
5526360	5528360	That's awesome.
5529360	5530360	You hear it all the time, but it's not true.
5530360	5532360	It's something they're saying.
5532360	5534360	They were talking about it at the Wonder Woman premiere,
5534360	5536360	but you couldn't get in.
5536360	5538360	It's not true and it's not fair.
5538360	5539360	Not true.
5539360	5540360	Sorry, sorry, sorry.
5540360	5541360	No, you're right.
5541360	5543360	It's not true.
5543360	5544360	No, no.
5544360	5546360	Finish your thought.
5546360	5547360	Finish your thought.
5547360	5548360	I'm sorry.
5548360	5549360	No, the idea is like, the question is just like,
5549360	5551360	why would it be that a man has like,
5551360	5554360	this really intense reaction to orgasm,
5554360	5556360	which we call the refractory period,
5556360	5558360	whereas a woman can have multiple orgasms,
5558360	5560360	and the implication, according to Chris Ryan,
5560360	5563360	is that, well, this is clearly like,
5563360	5566360	created with the idea of like, a multiplicity of level.
5566360	5567360	Well, but Chris Ryan...
5567360	5568360	I mean, that's...
5568360	5569360	What's interesting about Chris Ryan,
5569360	5570360	because he's a well-needed like,
5570360	5573360	update to Desmond Morris, who's in the 60s,
5573360	5576360	but Desmond Morris's theory about that was that...
5576360	5579360	But I don't want to be part of a patriarchy.
5579360	5582360	But the Desmond Morris theory was that,
5582360	5585360	yeah, men fall asleep because then you bond
5585360	5587360	emotionally with your lover.
5587360	5589360	Bullshit.
5589360	5590360	But here's the thing.
5590360	5592360	It's because we get sleepy.
5592360	5596360	But there is a scientifically...
5596360	5597360	Like, it goes back to...
5597360	5599360	It all has to do with human babies
5599360	5603360	being more biologically vulnerable than tiger babies,
5603360	5605360	deer babies, and cactus babies.
5605360	5606360	I don't know.
5606360	5607360	I mean, I don't know.
5607360	5608360	I think why Chris Ryan makes it pretty...
5608360	5610360	That's why I just claim the fuck out of it.
5610360	5611360	But I do think that it's a delight.
5611360	5614360	I really prefer that Desmond Morris's theory,
5614360	5616360	like, all of the biological quirks about us
5616360	5618360	are all designed for pair bonding
5618360	5620360	because our babies need two parents.
5620360	5621360	Well, you can still pair bond.
5621360	5622360	I mean, like, it's not...
5622360	5623360	You can't...
5623360	5624360	The idea isn't that you...
5624360	5627360	By the way, I'm like severely embarrassingly monogamous.
5627360	5628360	So don't get me wrong.
5628360	5629360	I'm not some kind of like,
5629360	5631360	just got back from Burning Man, Dan,
5631360	5634360	and now I've learned we got to be non-monogamous.
5634360	5636360	Your girlfriend's pretty.
5636360	5637360	I'm not like that.
5637360	5638360	Don't worry, man.
5638360	5640360	That's not fucking happening.
5640360	5642360	I'm severely, desperately,
5642360	5646360	based on insecurity, completely fucking monogamous.
5646360	5648360	So don't get me wrong,
5648360	5650360	but like from a perspective of like,
5650360	5654360	yeah, like the idea kind of would be...
5654360	5657360	And again, this is not my idea.
5657360	5658360	Like, I couldn't do this,
5658360	5660360	but the idea would be if you really love somebody,
5660360	5662360	wouldn't you want them to come a lot?
5662360	5663360	Nah.
5663360	5665360	Not with you.
5668360	5671360	Dan, I'd have to love you and not them.
5672360	5674360	Dan, if you really love Cody,
5674360	5676360	let Duncan fuck you tonight, man.
5676360	5677360	Listen, man.
5677360	5680360	Listen, I didn't say it like that.
5680360	5684360	We're sitting right next to Steve Perfectcock leaving over here.
5685360	5687360	Let her have a good Saturday night.
5687360	5689360	It's Saturday night.
5690360	5692360	Let her live a little.
5693360	5696360	Look, I don't want to forbid
5696360	5698360	Steve and Duncan to fuck Cody.
5699360	5701360	Now you're talking!
5702360	5705360	I want Cody to not want that.
5705360	5706360	All right.
5706360	5708360	Well, no, Dan, can I make a dumb joke?
5708360	5710360	Wait, let me just say this very quickly.
5710360	5711360	I just made a stupid dumb joke.
5711360	5713360	I don't mean that at all.
5713360	5715360	What I'm saying is it's like,
5715360	5718360	from my POV in the society that I was born into,
5718360	5720360	because of my own levels of insecurity
5720360	5722360	and where I'm at in my life,
5722360	5723360	I want to be monogamous,
5723360	5725360	and I will continue to be monogamous.
5725360	5726360	I'm not changing that.
5726360	5727360	That's me.
5727360	5728360	That's who I am.
5728360	5729360	I've always been like that.
5729360	5730360	I can't change it.
5730360	5732360	But if you look like, if you like zoom out
5732360	5736360	and you look at like what evolution wants,
5736360	5739360	you realize monogamy itself is a cultural,
5739360	5741360	it's like a new imposition.
5741360	5744360	It dovetails with this whole thing about anarchy versus capitalism,
5744360	5746360	because it's like, oh, you know what?
5746360	5751360	I get to pretend I was born into this stainless steel concrete jungle
5751360	5753360	and that, hey, it wasn't my idea to do this,
5753360	5755360	but hey, will you be my girlfriend?
5755360	5757360	At the same time, I'm like, hey, it wasn't my idea
5757360	5761360	to have the American dollar be the standard of the entire planet.
5761360	5763360	But hey, what are you going to do?
5763360	5767360	But then push comes to shove as in cultural upheaval,
5767360	5769360	and right now, capitalistically, we're going like,
5769360	5773360	yeah, again, but theoretically, anarchy is the...
5773360	5774360	Not theoretic.
5774360	5776360	It's not the more popular way to do it,
5776360	5778360	but it is the way that we would do it.
5778360	5783360	And I think you're saying the same thing about polyamory
5783360	5787360	or whatever they call it, these kids.
5787360	5791360	If you go to the bathroom here, it's disgusting.
5791360	5793360	Okay.
5793360	5796360	It was a joke, or maybe not.
5796360	5798360	I have a special bathroom upstairs.
5798360	5807360	It's rhinestones and just all the cultist daughters.
5807360	5809360	But yeah, I think you're saying the same thing I am,
5809360	5812360	which is that theoretically, intellectually,
5812360	5814360	not wanting to be guilty of dishonesty,
5814360	5816360	one should acknowledge it.
5816360	5820360	Yeah, probably there's a freer humankind
5820360	5823360	that functions better and healthier.
5823360	5826360	But then also, it's important then to go,
5826360	5828360	just as I did before I quit smoking,
5828360	5830360	where I was like, I like smoking.
5830360	5834360	My therapist says, awareness, acceptance, change.
5834360	5836360	People skip acceptance.
5836360	5838360	They're like, oh, I'm aware.
5838360	5839360	I'm doing this.
5839360	5842360	I'm going to stop doing it.
5842360	5844360	And then you just ping pong back and forth.
5844360	5846360	That's why I don't quit drinking.
5846360	5849360	I have to accept it first.
5849360	5851360	I've become aware I drink a lot.
5851360	5854360	I'm still working on accepting it.
5854360	5856360	Then I'll change it later.
5856360	5859360	I've seen you accept a lot of drinks.
5859360	5860360	Me too.
5860360	5862360	Especially, yeah.
5862360	5865360	But that guy with the, well, it's all one big city.
5865360	5867360	Speaking of drinks, we never shot him out.
5867360	5868360	Matt, the bartender over here.
5868360	5870360	Matt, our bartender.
5870360	5873360	Yeah, give him big tips.
5873360	5877360	Truly the hardest working person in Harbin Town.
5877360	5878360	All right.
5878360	5881360	Keeping these bunch of fucking reprobates happy.
5881360	5882360	I apologize to Spencer.
5882360	5884360	I know he's going to say he doesn't give a fuck,
5884360	5886360	but that's because he's my son.
5886360	5887360	What?
5887360	5888360	Yeah, whatever.
5888360	5890360	We'll talk about it later.
5890360	5894360	All these jokes about fucking my mom, all of a sudden a lion.
5894360	5896360	And my fascination would come.
5897360	5902360	Yeah, I always just rolled off your fascination with cum as normal.
5905360	5907360	Duncan was making me feel better,
5907360	5914360	so I kept him in my mouth like one of those ring pops.
5914360	5917360	Like one of those Levi cocks.
5918360	5920360	That's delicious.
5920360	5925360	Oh, so good.
5925360	5926360	You know what?
5926360	5927360	It's not that.
5927360	5928360	Why am I making the diameter?
5928360	5931360	No, it's like a nice broomstick diameter.
5931360	5935360	And it's like, it's gentle but firm.
5935360	5937360	And it's there when you need it.
5937360	5939360	And if you get thirsty afterwards,
5939360	5941360	it gets you a glass of water without you asking.
5941360	5942360	Whoa.
5942360	5944360	So you could make more of that take.
5944360	5945360	Also a cum.
5945360	5948360	Steve, leave his dick to something you almost know that Dick does.
5948360	5951360	I think it makes you the best avocado toast you've ever fucking had.
5951360	5952360	Wow.
5952360	5955360	It's a little basil, a little feta on it, some olive oil.
5955360	5956360	Fucking perfect.
5956360	5958360	That's why Steve can't afford a house.
5958360	5960360	I got in an argument with this dick, though.
5960360	5961360	Oh, no.
5961360	5965360	Because I said to it, this is just a sandwich, man.
5965360	5967360	Avocado toast is just a sandwich.
5967360	5968360	All right, forget it.
5968360	5972360	That's for another podcast.
5972360	5974360	Well, let Duncan know you want him to come back
5974360	5977360	by thanking him with your hands.
5978360	5988360	Thank you, Duncan.
5988360	5990360	Thank you.
5990360	5993360	See you soon.
5993360	5996360	Duncan Chustle.
5996360	5997360	I feel like...
5997360	6000360	He just makes everything a little bit better, doesn't he?
6000360	6001360	Yeah, he does.
6001360	6006360	Yeah, he's like walking serotonin.
6006360	6008360	All right, why don't you marry him?
6008360	6012360	He's probably back there fucking my girlfriend.
6012360	6014360	In the beginning of that rant, I thought you were going to say
6014360	6015360	you wanted like...
6015360	6016360	It just sounded like you're going towards...
6016360	6019360	You wanted like an incremental cum clicker, like cookie collector,
6019360	6021360	where you get the inner workings of the...
6021360	6022360	Oh, that would be amazing.
6022360	6024360	And you'd like manufacture your own sperm,
6024360	6026360	and finally you'd have understanding of...
6026360	6028360	I swear to God, I really am...
6028360	6031360	Can we stop saying loads?
6031360	6033360	Well, I don't know what to...
6034360	6036360	There is no...
6036360	6037360	The language fails.
6037360	6040360	It is a truly fascinating thing that as mammals,
6040360	6044360	we take in energy and then we have a little factory
6044360	6046360	that has to dangle between our legs
6046360	6049360	because it requires like a degree cooler environment
6049360	6053360	just for the chemical process of making them, not storing them.
6053360	6058360	Once they're made, they're fine in summer, you know, whatever.
6058360	6060360	They're going to get made one degree cooler.
6060360	6062360	And they're just like those little fucking missiles
6062360	6065360	that are just loaded with the need to hit an egg
6065360	6068360	and they're like simultaneously geniuses and idiots
6068360	6070360	and they're just disposable
6070360	6073360	and we're just constantly making them until the day they bury us.
6073360	6076360	But like women's eggs are like they're finite
6076360	6078360	and they're like they're giant,
6078360	6081360	like they're the size of the sun compared to a sperm's rocket.
6081360	6082360	And like it's just like this amazing...
6082360	6084360	I'm just so fascinated with all of it.
6084360	6086360	All right, let's...
6086360	6088360	I don't know whether we have enough time.
6089360	6091360	We found out tonight...
6091360	6092360	No, it's fine.
6092360	6093360	We have time.
6093360	6094360	Come on.
6094360	6095360	I don't know.
6095360	6096360	Let's give the audience some D&D.
6096360	6099360	We started a little late.
6099360	6102360	We've only got like 11 minutes tops.
6102360	6103360	That's what I'm saying.
6103360	6104360	We found out tonight that you love Tom.
6104360	6106360	Spencer's the game master.
6106360	6109360	He makes the rule, like we can't announce cliffhanger
6109360	6110360	endings and things like that.
6110360	6112360	Spencer's in charge of the thing.
6112360	6114360	So if he says...
6114360	6116360	We should get Duncan back.
6117360	6118360	Hey, Duncan, are you back?
6118360	6119360	Duncan, come back.
6119360	6120360	He probably loves us.
6120360	6122360	We're not going to play D&D.
6122360	6124360	What was that?
6124360	6126360	I'll just pretend to...
6126360	6128360	Well, how about this, Spencer?
6128360	6129360	Because I was not here.
6129360	6131360	Let's just recap so we...
6131360	6133360	Duncan's back.
6133360	6135360	Oh, shit.
6139360	6141360	Thank you for having me back.
6141360	6144360	He sucked all of our girlfriends that quickly.
6144360	6145360	Yeah.
6145360	6147360	Which was a really long time for me.
6147360	6148360	That's part of his appeal.
6148360	6149360	That's how he gets them.
6149360	6152360	Hey, man, this won't take a lot of time.
6154360	6156360	I'm not going to put you out, man.
6156360	6157360	I'm glad you brought me back.
6157360	6159360	I got a cheesy thing to say.
6159360	6160360	Uh-oh.
6160360	6161360	To cut off whatever you were going to say,
6161360	6163360	which is probably the funniest thing you can even do.
6163360	6165360	It was going to be trenchant and hilarious, but go ahead.
6165360	6166360	Oh, no.
6166360	6168360	Leave me.
6168360	6170360	I had to tell you this thing.
6170360	6171360	Okay.
6171360	6173360	Because like, you know Jack Cornfield,
6173360	6174360	the Buddhist teacher?
6174360	6176360	No.
6176360	6179360	You don't know Jack Cornfield?
6179360	6180360	He owes me ten bucks.
6180360	6182360	He's not here, right?
6182360	6184360	So he tells this great story.
6184360	6185360	And guaranteed...
6185360	6187360	Think about having a broken heart.
6187360	6189360	Guaranteed there's a bunch of people here right now
6189360	6191360	who have a fucking broken heart,
6191360	6192360	because that's what it means to be human.
6192360	6194360	But there's a...
6194360	6199360	Jack Cornfield talks about how there's a story in Judaism
6200360	6206360	where there was a rabbi that made his students
6206360	6208360	hold the...you know Teflon?
6208360	6209360	You know what that is?
6209360	6210360	Yeah.
6210360	6211360	To felon?
6211360	6212360	To felon, yeah.
6212360	6213360	Eggs don't stick to it.
6216360	6218360	NASA invented it.
6218360	6223360	Don't tell me the Jews made that.
6223360	6224360	That was NASA.
6224360	6225360	You're right, dude.
6225360	6227360	It is one of the weird mysteries of the universe,
6227360	6228360	is the eggs don't stick to it.
6228360	6229360	What is Teflon?
6229360	6230360	What?
6230360	6231360	Do you remember that?
6231360	6232360	Take it away, Steve.
6232360	6234360	It's like the shit they cook eggs on.
6234360	6235360	I know Teflon.
6235360	6236360	What's Teflon?
6236360	6237360	What's the thing you're talking about?
6237360	6239360	No, we talked about this earlier in the year.
6239360	6242360	Remember I got accosted in Beverly Hills by...
6242360	6243360	Oh, right.
6243360	6246360	They put a Parker Brothers thing on your head.
6246360	6248360	That's Teflon, where they wrap it around your arms.
6248360	6249360	Okay, gotcha.
6249360	6250360	Yeah, yeah.
6250360	6253360	The point is, inside this box are these scrolls.
6253360	6255360	And I don't know what's written on them,
6255360	6257360	but there's something amazing written on them.
6257360	6259360	So Jack Kornfield tells a story.
6259360	6260360	How, like...
6260360	6263360	I already know you're gonna fucking make fun of this, man.
6263360	6264360	I know you're gonna, like, got some already.
6264360	6266360	But, like, Jack Kornfield tells a story...
6266360	6269360	Is he a Jewish Buddhist?
6269360	6274360	He might have started off Jewish and then became Buddhist.
6274360	6276360	Like, a lot of people that I learned from are, like...
6276360	6279360	They started off Jewish and then became, like, Buddhist or Hindu.
6279360	6280360	But it doesn't...
6280360	6281360	The whole thing is, like...
6281360	6282360	Because those robes...
6282360	6284360	It's ridiculous to say what you're already...
6284360	6286360	The point is...
6286360	6287360	I'm not gonna say it.
6287360	6289360	You know what the Jewish Buddhist says?
6289360	6290360	What?
6290360	6292360	Oim.
6294360	6295360	Yes!
6297360	6298360	God damn you!
6298360	6299360	Wait, did you...
6299360	6300360	You didn't...
6300360	6301360	You heard that somewhere.
6301360	6302360	Wait a minute.
6307360	6309360	Wait, what if he heard that somewhere?
6309360	6311360	What if he got that out of a bazooka joe...
6314360	6315360	Oim.
6316360	6318360	Did you just make that up?
6318360	6319360	Yes.
6319360	6320360	That's not fair.
6320360	6321360	Muzzle toe.
6321360	6322360	That's not fair.
6322360	6323360	Muzzle toe!
6323360	6325360	Oim is the title.
6325360	6326360	That's the title.
6326360	6327360	O-Y-M?
6327360	6328360	Is that what it would be?
6328360	6330360	Let me warm my way out of this thing, please.
6330360	6331360	No, no, no.
6331360	6332360	So...
6332360	6333360	So...
6333360	6339360	The idea is, like, this rabbi, like, makes his students hold the teff...
6339360	6340360	To fill in.
6340360	6341360	To fill in.
6341360	6343360	It gets their heart when they're, like, saying prayers.
6343360	6345360	And one of them said to him,
6345360	6349360	Why do you make us hold this against our heart when we're saying prayers?
6349360	6350360	And he said,
6350360	6354360	So that maybe when your heart breaks, the prayers will fall inside.
6355360	6356360	That's cool, right?
6359360	6360360	It's a nice thought.
6360360	6361360	Yeah.
6361360	6362360	So a heart break is a...
6362360	6364360	Yeah, it's a thing that's a...
6364360	6365360	It's like...
6365360	6366360	Yeah, it's a crack...
6366360	6367360	Cracking and then, like...
6367360	6368360	Yeah, it's like an evolving thing.
6368360	6369360	It's a crack that prayers can fill.
6369360	6370360	Like me and Twitter.
6370360	6371360	Yeah, and it doesn't stay open.
6371360	6373360	It cracks like an egg and it falls on the telephone.
6373360	6374360	No, it's like...
6374360	6375360	Like...
6375360	6376360	It's a sacred moat.
6376360	6379360	The thing is, like, if you get your fucking heart broken,
6379360	6382360	which is a very rare occurrence in a human incarnation,
6382360	6383360	it really doesn't happen all that much.
6383360	6386360	But when you finally get your fucking heart broken,
6386360	6389360	you are walking through the kingdom of heaven.
6389360	6390360	Like, you are in heaven right now.
6390360	6392360	You don't realize it.
6392360	6395360	You don't realize it, because, like, everybody thinks heaven is, like,
6395360	6398360	just like, you know, infinite blow jobs or what.
6398360	6400360	I don't know what people think heaven is.
6400360	6402360	But that's not what heaven is.
6402360	6405360	Heaven is direct contact with reality.
6405360	6410360	So right now, you're having direct contact with eternity,
6410360	6412360	and that's, like, a holy moment.
6412360	6414360	And so, like, you won't...
6414360	6415360	The window shuts.
6415360	6416360	That's what I'm saying, man.
6416360	6417360	Like, your heart break window,
6417360	6421360	you probably got, like, another, like, I don't know, 20 years,
6421360	6422360	and then you'll start...
6422360	6423360	Stop suffering.
6423360	6424360	No, you probably have, like...
6424360	6425360	I got...
6425360	6426360	I thought of something...
6426360	6427360	I can...
6427360	6428360	I can...
6428360	6429360	I can beat...
6429360	6433360	I can be smarter than this philosopher guy.
6433360	6435360	You've met him!
6435360	6437360	Don't talk shit about Jack Kornfield.
6437360	6438360	Get off Twitter.
6438360	6439360	No, I can beat him.
6439360	6440360	I can beat him.
6440360	6441360	I can beat him.
6441360	6442360	Okay.
6442360	6443360	So your heart...
6443360	6444360	So your heart's broken.
6444360	6446360	You know what else is broken?
6446360	6447360	A baby's skull.
6447360	6448360	You know why?
6448360	6451360	So it can grow into an adult skull.
6451360	6452360	Oh.
6452360	6453360	There you go.
6453360	6454360	That's basically the same thing.
6454360	6455360	I think that might be it.
6455360	6456360	I think I could talk that...
6456360	6458360	So there's this ancient Japanese...
6458360	6459360	Is that a John and Gacy quote?
6459360	6460360	...art of pottery.
6460360	6462360	You know, sometimes their pots break,
6462360	6466360	and they actually have this method of reforging
6466360	6469360	the pottery pieces with gold inlay.
6469360	6470360	Yeah.
6470360	6471360	And it's actually...
6471360	6472360	Yeah.
6472360	6474360	It's more beautiful than it was before it was broken,
6474360	6475360	and that's you.
6475360	6477360	You're gonna be all ribboned with gold,
6477360	6478360	and it'll be better.
6478360	6480360	Thank you, Spencer.
