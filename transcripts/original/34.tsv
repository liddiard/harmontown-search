10000	12360	And we host Suicide Buddies on Starburns Audio.
12360	13360	That's right.
13360	17520	It's a mental health podcast, it's about depression, it's about suicide.
17520	20240	It's also about history, and it's also about...
20240	21240	Having fun!
21240	22240	Dave and I having a blast.
22240	26800	Yeah, we talk about suicidal thoughts in us and other people, because we've dealt with
26800	27800	that stuff.
27800	30080	We joke around about it, try to bring some light to the subject.
30080	31640	Yeah, who are we talking about this week?
31640	35500	This week we're talking about Gene Weber, a French serial killer who committed suicide
35500	36500	in 1910.
36500	39600	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
39600	41680	Serial and killers?
41680	42680	I like both!
42680	43680	Oh no!
43680	44680	No!
44680	47440	You're gonna hate this episode then.
47440	49520	Listen to Suicide Buddies on Starburns Audio.
49520	54840	You can find it wherever you get your podcasts, Stitcher, Spotify, iTunes, wherever.
54840	55840	My butt.
55840	56840	I love you.
56840	57560	Bye.
57800	66280	Hey everybody, I'm Kyle Ayers, I'm the host of Never Seen It, where I have people rewrite
66280	69000	famous movies and television shows they've never seen.
69000	71000	We have a very special episode coming up.
71000	74120	Lawrence of Arabia was rewritten by Dan Harmon.
74120	80000	Yeah, that's a real burn burner.
80000	82480	So please check it out wherever you listen to podcasts.
87800	114080	From the lofty heights of the comedy attic in Bloomington, Harmontown, once again, is
114080	116880	in session.
116880	123880	Please put your hands together for the mayor of Harmontown, Dan Harmon!
123880	126880	Hello!
126880	144880	He's making a drink, because he drank too much backstage.
144880	150240	Gotta make another drink.
150240	151240	That wouldn't make sense.
151240	154000	Oh, I drank so much of it that I needed more.
154000	155000	Whatever.
155000	156000	Wow, the rooms fall.
156000	157000	Hello Bloomington.
157000	160080	You know, I'm a Midwesterner.
160080	162000	Indiana's the Midwest, right?
162000	163000	Okay.
163000	164000	We're now even closer.
164000	167640	We were in Pittsburgh last night, and I was starting to feel that familiar chill.
167640	173480	As I explained to my girlfriend, there's different kinds of coldness, and we're getting closer
173480	179520	and closer to the coldness of my home, a coldness that makes your heart cold, and not
179520	184280	just your skin, but it's a different flavor, and Indiana's cold is feeling more and more
184280	186960	like Milwaukee's cold, and we're in the Midwest.
186960	193400	And I know that there's a culture that comes with the Midwest that is directly attributed
193400	195480	to its climate.
195480	204280	When you live someplace where it gets this cold, you are the product of people whose
204280	214200	wagons broke down halfway to California, and who decided, let's stick it out here.
214200	218080	And there's a religion that has to come with that, a personal religion and a cosmic religion
218080	224360	of don't have too much pretentiousness.
224360	228800	We're an honest people in the Midwest, because we don't want to commit the crime of being
228800	232000	overly ambitious, overly cocky.
232000	234400	We stick to that Icarus myth very much.
234400	238240	When you move to California from the Midwest, the people always say, you'll be back, and
238240	242040	they mean it as both an insult and a compliment.
242040	243520	And I know you guys know this.
243520	247820	I know Garrison Keeler already told you, and I know that every comic that comes through
247820	251000	here probably reminds you of it, because there's an outside perspective on that.
251000	252640	Because I'm from the Midwest, Jeff.
252640	259800	I just wanted to celebrate Indiana as being the most exciting, specific state in the entire
259800	263080	country.
263080	265960	What makes it so specific?
265960	270480	There's a lot of things that make it very specific, Jeff.
270480	271480	Was the typewriter?
271480	277360	As you know, I Wikipedia research every place we go.
277360	286480	You can see in just the effort that someone took to, let's see, I didn't actually have
286480	287920	this up until you mentioned that.
287920	289660	This wasn't a pre-rehearsed bit.
289660	292500	He just reminded me of the fact that, I don't know, it doesn't matter.
292500	293500	Why am I going to look?
293500	294500	I don't read it.
294500	301240	I looked at the Wikipedia thing and it said, Indiana is the 19th state to blah, blah, blah.
301240	302640	Everything's like right in the middle.
302640	306840	Everything's like, it's the 16th coldest state.
306840	308240	One thing, it started real hot.
308240	319320	It was like, Indiana is the least extensive state in the contiguous United States west
319320	322000	of the Appalachians.
322000	325120	Just even an attempt to be the least something came up short.
325120	328760	It just bobbed right to the middle of the tank.
328760	331400	Nothing extreme can be sad or happen here.
331400	332560	But we're going to change that tonight.
332560	340720	We're going to make Indiana the most extreme place in the world.
340720	344040	A guy just yelled out extreme Pringles for no reason.
344040	348480	That's a new thing that happened here.
348480	352320	A guy feeling comfortable yelling out extreme Pringles.
352320	357520	Did you know, Jeff, that Indiana invented glass?
357520	360160	I thought that was the Phoenicians.
360160	366840	Did you know that Indiana has more murders with hammers?
366840	371320	Between the Appalachians and the Rockies.
371320	373320	Just the most murders with hammers, period.
373320	376160	Out of anywhere in the world.
376160	382480	Did you know, Jeff, that Indiana- I did not know that.
382480	388360	Did you know they once successfully invaded Michigan?
388360	391560	Why didn't they annex it and keep it?
391560	392560	Because they're cool people.
392560	394560	They're good people.
394560	396880	They like it in Indiana.
396880	407920	Did you know that fluorescent light was banned here for 13 years because there was a socialist
407920	410920	mayor of Indianapolis?
410920	414760	I don't know.
414760	415760	Worth a try.
415760	420480	Also, the state famous for its basketball.
420480	421480	Sports corner.
421480	422480	Sports corner.
422480	432080	Everybody's not tapping it for Dan Harmon's sports corner.
432080	433640	He knows about sports.
433640	435640	He knows you like sports.
435640	441680	Gonna talk about sports.
441680	449080	By the Hoosiers, Jeff, really, really out there dribbling the sphere, taking it basket
449080	450080	to basket.
450080	452040	It's been a great, great quarterly season.
452040	457360	Do you feel that Gene Hackman's coming down too hard on the team?
457360	460200	Hackman's always been an offensive coach.
460200	466720	In a time of defense, there are times when you've got to go defense in the fiscal quarter.
466720	468560	Which of the four quarters is the most fiscal?
469560	472280	Well, certainly you've got the winter conference, you've got the spring conference, and you've
472280	479520	got the pumpkin ball, but Hackman, obviously, is going to be able to push that ball closer
479520	480520	to the net.
480520	488960	We're talking again about a game of yardage in those fall months, that fall season, Jeff.
488960	491800	So the key is to handicap the players.
491800	493080	You've got to keep handicapping them.
493080	495240	How do you feel about all this Notre Dame scandal?
495240	501440	Well, that was chickens coming home to roost when you have a team poised with that kind
501440	502440	of hubris.
502440	506160	They're saying the things they're saying at the all-stars, saying what they're saying
506160	512120	at regionals, saying again, doubling down at all-star regionals.
512120	518920	You've got a team that's got too much high game and not enough low game, they're taking
518920	524320	too many three-pointers, too many free agents, too much scrimmage, too much offense, Jeff.
524320	526520	And it was going to cry, it was going to come tumbling down.
526520	528760	They built a glass menagerie, Jeff.
528760	529760	Gotcha.
529760	533680	And do you like the Pacers this year, or do you think?
533680	537840	They're good, they're looking good, they've got to keep those knees iced, they've got
537840	545200	to keep everything, they're ducks in a row, just keep focusing on the lines of scrimmage.
545200	570000	First corner!
570000	573320	Some facts about Bloomington, the city, Jeff.
573320	578080	Six blocks from here is where Lincoln was shot.
578080	579080	The first time?
579080	580080	Yeah.
580080	581080	Yeah.
581080	589000	Winged in the leg on the way to a rehearsal for My American Cousin at the Ford Jr. Theatre.
589000	591480	Take a hint, Abe.
591480	595120	People don't publicize it because they want to make them into a big martyr.
595120	598240	The truth is, he was warned.
598240	600240	And that was back when he supported slavery.
600240	601240	Yes.
602160	605000	Would have been a terrible news item back then.
605000	606680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
606680	614920	And the guy who assassinated him, John Wilkes Bench, the guy that shot him the first time
614920	615920	in the leg.
615920	617880	Oh, yeah, Gabriel Byrne.
617880	620880	You know what he...
620880	623160	Bench, Gabriel Byrne Bench.
623160	628320	You know what he said to him in Latin as he shot him in the leg.
628320	635240	Sirannus, maltannus, six simpered, don'tannus, nannus.
635240	636240	Which means...
636240	637240	Talk to the hannus.
637240	641840	Which means don't be a tyrant and this won't happen in a more fatal way to you.
641840	642840	Yeah.
642840	644360	And then what did Lincoln do?
644360	649760	Ooh, let's abolish slavery, go see a play, idiot.
649760	650760	Had it coming.
650760	651760	Well, he didn't have it coming.
651760	652760	Nobody has it coming.
652760	657760	But he saw it coming and he did it.
658760	661760	Is there a mouse in here?
668760	670760	This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
670760	672760	Podcast listeners can't appreciate this.
672760	678760	But there's a grip on the mic stand that you adjust the height of it.
678760	679760	It's not...
679760	680760	Usually there's a twisty thing.
680760	683560	We've all seen that twisty motion that comics have to...
683560	690560	As a man who's had to do this 20 nights in a row, I couldn't be more excited about this.
692560	695560	A professional like me invented this, Jeff.
695560	698560	A professional entertainer.
700560	702560	Let's get Spencer up here.
702560	704560	Yeah.
704560	708560	We've been bringing him up earlier and earlier in the show.
708560	712560	Because the fact is Spencer is the show.
712560	713560	There's no bad Spencer.
713560	714560	It's better to have him than not.
714560	715560	Yeah.
715560	716560	Hello, Spencer.
716560	717560	Hey, how's it going?
717560	718560	Good.
718560	719560	How was the merch table?
719560	720560	How were sales?
720560	723560	Sales were average to sub par.
723560	724560	Buy stuff, you guys.
724560	726560	Oh, wow.
726560	728560	Well, it's all right if you don't.
728560	729560	I don't care.
729560	731560	We're not trying to make any money or anything.
731560	732560	We're just...
732560	735560	We're trying to free up the bus base.
735560	740560	Our bus driver almost quit when he saw the amount of merch that we had endeavored to bring on his trip.
740560	742560	Because there's no room for us on the bus.
742560	744560	There's just trash bags of shirts.
744560	746560	We could have brought a third of that probably, right?
746560	748560	Yeah.
748560	750560	So tonight, Jeff, is it going to be...
750560	751560	We couldn't figure out...
751560	755560	We're a couple podcasts behind in the broadcasting of what we've been recording.
755560	760560	You haven't yet heard the show in Arlington, which is a little Nash-villy, I guess.
760560	761560	I don't know.
761560	764560	It was a little more kind of raucous, kind of sloppy Joe, I would say.
764560	765560	Arlington?
765560	766560	Yeah.
766560	768560	I think we brought all black people up on stage.
768560	771560	We had all eight black audience members up on stage.
771560	776560	And we somehow managed to set civil rights back about 45 years.
776560	778560	But that's what we do out here.
778560	780560	We experiment on the road.
780560	784560	It was a fun show, but a drunken raucous one.
784560	791560	Then in Pittsburgh, I became very ill, I think, from shaking everyone's hands and things.
791560	793560	And it's not on you.
793560	795560	It's on Rhode Island.
795560	796560	Yeah.
796560	801560	Something's on them that I'll Purell so you don't get it tonight.
801560	806560	But it was an emotionally cathartic show, Jeff.
806560	807560	Yeah.
807560	811560	And then D&D became Sally Jessie Raphael.
811560	817560	And there was deep sadness and deep ennui.
817560	818560	Yeah.
818560	821560	Aaron and I talked to each other about our relationship during D&D.
821560	826560	Brought the house down, but not in a funny ha-ha way.
826560	827560	In a sad.
827560	828560	Brought it down.
828560	830560	Brought the house down.
830560	831560	Emotionally.
831560	835560	And then we ended.
835560	842560	So the big question is, according to Joseph Campbell, was last night the meeting with the goddess?
842560	845560	Therefore, is tonight the beginning of the troubles?
845560	848560	Or was last night the end of a road of trials?
848560	856560	Therefore, tonight is going to be weightless and carefree and mellow, like a kind of dream poppy meditative experience.
856560	859560	Let's experiment with that first.
859560	862560	Do you have any new age music in there, Jeff?
862560	864560	I have kind of like that.
864560	865560	Do you have something mellow?
865560	866560	Hang on a second.
866560	867560	I do.
872560	875560	Can we bring the lights down just a little bit?
876560	878560	Perfect, thank you.
881560	882560	Ooh, yeah.
882560	884560	Can we bring them down even more?
884560	885560	Even more?
885560	886560	Even more?
889560	890560	That's good.
890560	891560	Okay, good.
891560	892560	That's good.
892560	896560	That's really not what I had in mind, what you're playing, but I don't think you have.
896560	898560	I want a cosmic voyage.
898560	900560	I want to go on a cosmic voyage.
901560	907560	I'm using all stuff for our movie that we have the right to use, like unlicensed stuff, so I don't have a whole...
907560	908560	Is there anybody in here?
908560	909560	How about this?
909560	916560	Is there a female vocalist in the room so talented that you think you could kind of riff just a melodic kind of like...
916560	917560	Enya kind of thing?
917560	921560	Yeah, like an Enya kind of just copyright-free Enya kind of...
924560	925560	See, I can practically do it.
925560	927560	You shouldn't be that intimidated.
927560	928560	Anybody? Or a guy?
928560	929560	I see your hand raised.
929560	930560	All right.
930560	931560	Just give it a shot.
931560	932560	You can't be...
936560	937560	Your name?
938560	939560	Ruth, everybody.
939560	940560	Wow.
940560	941560	You got a Dalek snowman on your shirt.
941560	942560	That's very cool.
944560	945560	We see a lot of...
945560	948560	We see a lot of Doctor Who's t-shirts that are in our audience.
948560	949560	I love that.
949560	950560	Yeah.
950560	951560	All right, Ruth.
951560	953560	That's why a new sports corner would work.
954560	955560	Enya was the idea?
955560	958560	Yeah, just kind of like a mythical...
958560	959560	New Agey, like you're getting...
959560	960560	Middle-earth...
960560	962560	You're getting a massage, you know.
962560	964560	Maybe quitting smoking, maybe...
964560	965560	Yeah.
965560	970560	Maybe an elf is, you know, the nimbly running through a woodland area or something like that.
970560	972560	Like a non-smoking elf, you know?
972560	973560	A non-smoking elf, yeah.
973560	974560	Like a...
977560	978560	Close your eyes.
981560	982560	Drift to the center.
983560	987560	Come with me on a voyage off the cosmos.
989560	993560	Your soul is not bound to your corporeal frame.
994560	996560	It is rising.
996560	998560	Rising above the stratosphere.
1002560	1003560	Nice reamer.
1003560	1004560	Wow.
1004560	1006560	Hey, what are you doing here, Jeff?
1006560	1007560	I'm sorry.
1007560	1009560	Jeez, I'm trying to relax these people.
1009560	1010560	I'm sorry.
1010560	1012560	Pretend I'm not here.
1013560	1014560	Jesus.
1014560	1015560	Fucking asshole.
1016560	1017560	Keep going.
1019560	1020560	Sorry, where were we?
1020560	1021560	The stratosphere?
1022560	1023560	Okay.
1023560	1025560	Okay, your body pulls back.
1026560	1030560	Growing ever distant from its terrestrial origins.
1032560	1034560	You see Jupiter pass on the right.
1035560	1036560	Goodbye, Jupiter.
1039560	1042560	It's a big planet, but not a lot happens there.
1043560	1045560	Some say it's compensating for something.
1047560	1049560	Some say that's a dumb joke.
1050560	1053560	Then it's still others, and these are the people I'd agree with.
1053560	1056560	I'm making it up, and you get what you pay for.
1057560	1060560	Then another guy might come in and say, they probably paid a lot.
1062560	1065560	Then maybe a sixth guy would come in and say, how much?
1066560	1069560	The seventh guy would say, at least 20 bucks, I'm imagining.
1069560	1070560	I don't know.
1070560	1071560	Hey, Ruth, what's up?
1071560	1072560	Yeah, what's going on?
1072560	1074560	Are you making me laugh too much?
1074560	1075560	Stay in the game, Ruth.
1075560	1076560	Jesus.
1076560	1078560	I'm stuck just behind Jupiter.
1081560	1082560	Floating out here like an asshole.
1083560	1085560	The cosmic show must go up.
1087560	1088560	Jeff, Jeff, can I, I'm sorry.
1088560	1091560	Every time you appear in the cosmos here, you sound a little ghostly.
1091560	1095560	I don't know if you understand the difference between the cosmic things and spooky things.
1095560	1097560	I don't know what you mean, Dan.
1098560	1100560	I'm a ghostly vampire.
1102560	1105560	I have lived in the cosmos for seven million years.
1108560	1110560	Sorry, please, I forgot your name, cosmos lady.
1110560	1111560	Ruth.
1111560	1112560	Yeah, Ruth.
1112560	1113560	Stay make with the...
1113560	1116560	I'm not actually 90 if people want to know.
1117560	1118560	90?
1118560	1119560	Oh, because you have an old lady's name?
1119560	1120560	Yeah.
1120560	1122560	Oh, I kind of never crossed my mind.
1123560	1124560	70 tops.
1126560	1129560	Ruthie Aslan, who edited Community's Best Seasons,
1130560	1134560	she's a young spry, a little hipster with Chuck Taylors.
1135560	1136560	Jeff.
1139560	1140560	Stealing my melody.
1141560	1143560	You're sinking in space now.
1144560	1145560	We've lost our momentum.
1146560	1148560	We're floating ever downward through space,
1148560	1150560	to the space below space,
1151560	1152560	under space,
1153560	1154560	crawl space.
1156560	1157560	There's a dead chipmunk here.
1158560	1160560	It's been stinking up your universe for years.
1164560	1165560	That's what that was.
1167560	1169560	Let's grab that chipmunk, scoop it out,
1171560	1173560	get rid of it, put it in the garbage.
1175560	1177560	Is this a special pickup required for that?
1179560	1181560	If it sat there under your house for two years,
1181560	1183560	it could certainly sit in the garbage for three days.
1184560	1186560	Go back in the house.
1192560	1194560	Reach for the highest cabinet you can find.
1195560	1196560	Open it.
1197560	1198560	There's a human head in it.
1199560	1201560	Jason's come back.
1202560	1205560	He's followed you to your home outside New York.
1206560	1209560	And yet, so many years later,
1209560	1211560	we'd make a big deal out of him going to Manhattan.
1212560	1213560	Relax.
1214560	1216560	It's not like he's a killer that hasn't traveled before.
1217560	1219560	He seems to know the transit system.
1220560	1222560	I think some of you 40-year-olds know what I'm talking about.
1223560	1224560	Jason Voorhees.
1225560	1226560	Platholes.
1227560	1231560	Let's get some consistency at table one, the 13th.
1233560	1234560	Relax.
1235560	1236560	Sorry.
1236560	1238560	You're rising up through your own roof,
1238560	1239560	leaving Jason Voorhees behind.
1239560	1240560	He can't get to you anymore.
1241560	1242560	You're going back out into space.
1244560	1245560	You see Jupiter again.
1246560	1247560	Let's go past it.
1248560	1250560	I think maybe Saturn, I can't keep track.
1251560	1252560	I can't remember.
1253560	1254560	There's Venus.
1254560	1255560	No, that should have been...
1256560	1257560	Okay, we're going the wrong way.
1258560	1259560	I'm sorry.
1260560	1261560	Apple Maps joke.
1262560	1263560	Apple Maps joke here.
1264560	1266560	Sorry for deconstructing the Apple Maps joke.
1266560	1268560	Sorry for deconstructing the Apple Maps joke
1268560	1270560	instead of just giving it to you straight.
1276560	1277560	There's the sun.
1279560	1281560	Definitely went the wrong way.
1283560	1284560	Go into the center of the sun.
1285560	1286560	The heat can't hurt you.
1287560	1288560	You have no body.
1291560	1294560	Did you know the center of the sun is actually quite cold?
1296560	1297560	It works like a refrigerator.
1300560	1302560	You know, you touch the back of a refrigerator,
1302560	1303560	it burns your hand.
1303560	1305560	Even though in the inside milk is cold.
1307560	1309560	It's cold here in the center of the sun.
1311560	1312560	Have a glass of milk.
1315560	1316560	Relax.
1318560	1319560	Indiana.
1321560	1322560	This is where you are.
1323560	1324560	At the center of all.
1325560	1327560	You will crave less cigarettes.
1329560	1331560	Heavy creams and sauces cannot give you comfort.
1332560	1334560	They will only make you gain weight.
1335560	1336560	You will be more productive at work.
1337560	1339560	More positive in your social affairs.
1340560	1342560	Swimming will become easier for you.
1344560	1345560	You will grow gills.
1346560	1349560	You are now a member of my aquatic super army.
1350560	1352560	Non-smoking.
1353560	1354560	Sauce-hating.
1355560	1357560	Supervising managers.
1360560	1362560	That swim 900 miles per hour.
1363560	1364560	Now go back to earth with you.
1365560	1366560	Claim my birthright.
1369560	1370560	Alright, thank you Ruth.
1371560	1372560	Ruth, everybody.
1372560	1373560	Everybody.
1377560	1379560	Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap.
1380560	1381560	Shit.
1381560	1382560	Rapping hard.
1382560	1383560	Rapping in Indiana.
1383560	1384560	In the yard.
1384560	1385560	Rapping to your mama.
1385560	1386560	Rapping to your daddy.
1386560	1387560	Rapping like I'm Irish.
1387560	1388560	And my name was old Patty.
1388560	1389560	Got a cookie.
1389560	1391560	On my titty and my dick.
1391560	1392560	Rapped your mama.
1392560	1393560	Your mama's name's St. Nick.
1393560	1395560	Pulled her butt in her chimney.
1395560	1396560	Pussy.
1396560	1397560	I fucked your mama.
1397560	1398560	Nothing rhymes with pussy.
1398560	1399560	God damn it.
1399560	1400560	What rhymes with pussy?
1400560	1401560	Nothing rhymes with pussy.
1402560	1403560	What rhymes with pussy?
1403560	1404560	What rhymes with pussy?
1404560	1405560	Yeah, but.
1405560	1406560	Gary Busey.
1406560	1407560	Gary Busey is not bad.
1407560	1408560	Gary Busey is not bad.
1412560	1413560	Who said that?
1413560	1414560	Get up on stage.
1414560	1415560	Rap battle.
1415560	1417560	Come up on stage, sir.
1417560	1418560	Who said Gary Busey?
1418560	1419560	Who said Gary Busey?
1419560	1420560	I said Gary Busey.
1420560	1421560	Get up here.
1421560	1423560	Are you okay coming up?
1425560	1426560	We just want to meet you.
1427560	1429560	We just want to touch you.
1430560	1431560	What's your name?
1431560	1432560	Matt.
1432560	1433560	Hey, Matt.
1433560	1434560	Hi.
1434560	1435560	Hey, Dan.
1435560	1436560	Gary Busey.
1436560	1437560	It's not a firm rhyme, but it's not.
1437560	1438560	No, it's good enough, man.
1438560	1440560	I thought it would kind of shoehorn there a little bit in there.
1440560	1441560	Thanks.
1441560	1443560	That's what rapping's all about.
1443560	1446560	Rhyme and shit that you didn't know rhymed.
1446560	1447560	That's what makes M&M a genius.
1447560	1450560	Who said Gary Busey?
1450560	1451560	People would know.
1451560	1452560	Right.
1452560	1453560	No, Busey.
1453560	1457240	If I said I fucked your mama's titties and I fucked her pussy, I made her ass crazy like
1457240	1458920	her name was Gary Busey.
1458920	1461160	People would be impressed by that.
1461760	1463760	They would have bought a t-shirt.
1463760	1464760	Yeah.
1464760	1465760	I think you get a t-shirt.
1465760	1467760	Give them a t-shirt for Gary Busey.
1467760	1468760	Thank you.
1470760	1471760	Matt.
1471760	1472760	Matt.
1472760	1475760	Matt, what's your fondest ambition?
1475760	1479760	What can we somehow give to you in the form of even just fantasy?
1479760	1481760	Oh, dear God.
1482760	1489760	I think that if Tori almost got her old face back...
1489760	1490760	Oh, no.
1490760	1491760	She'd been doing plastic surgery?
1491760	1492760	Yeah.
1492760	1493760	Oh, no.
1493760	1494760	I was in love with Tori Amos.
1494760	1495760	Yeah.
1495760	1496760	You could probably imagine.
1496760	1497760	Maybe even...
1497760	1498760	Yeah.
1498760	1499760	So now I...
1499760	1500760	You know I was too.
1500760	1501760	Oh.
1501760	1502760	I hate to admit it.
1502760	1503760	Sorry.
1503760	1504760	She just kind of destroyed her looks now.
1504760	1505760	Was it working?
1505760	1506760	Yeah.
1506760	1509760	Well, if you do the before and after, she has this very elf and she had the dimples.
1509760	1512760	The dimples are gone.
1516760	1517760	It's very bad.
1517760	1518760	That's a bummer.
1518760	1519760	It is.
1519760	1520760	I'm sorry.
1520760	1525160	Well, I mean, I guess I could give that to you in the form of like a smartly improvised
1525160	1526160	scene.
1526160	1527160	Okay.
1527160	1528160	All right.
1528160	1529160	And there's nothing else.
1529160	1530160	Can we add to that?
1530160	1531160	Oh, you go ahead.
1531160	1532160	Just read it.
1532160	1533160	No, but I mean like...
1533160	1534160	Well, okay.
1534160	1535160	I'm hearing the word pickle.
1535160	1536160	No.
1536160	1539160	I meant like anything else that you want from life.
1539160	1545160	Well, what happens in the 13th episode after Giorgio Moroder helped save the Earth?
1545160	1546160	George...
1546160	1547160	Who?
1548160	1549160	You sure?
1550160	1551160	Was it?
1551160	1552160	Oh, yeah.
1552160	1553160	That's my smooth music.
1553160	1554160	I have no idea what you're talking about.
1554160	1555160	That's a Yacht Rock.
1555160	1556160	Oh, Yacht Rock.
1556160	1557160	Holy fuck.
1557160	1558160	Wow.
1558160	1559160	Yacht Rock.
1559160	1560160	But you're asking...
1560160	1562040	Is it a trivia question or is it an ending that you don't know?
1562040	1563760	Will there ever be another episode?
1563760	1564760	Oh, yeah.
1564760	1565760	I don't...
1565760	1566760	That's J.D. Risner and I don't have to know that.
1566760	1567760	Oh, yeah.
1567760	1568760	I mean, I'm just a guy.
1568760	1569760	I just played...
1569760	1570760	What's his name?
1570760	1571760	You don't even know.
1571760	1572760	I can't remember his name.
1572760	1573760	The Ted Templeman.
1573760	1574760	Yeah.
1574760	1575760	I played David Lee Ross.
1575760	1576760	Yeah.
1576760	1577760	What's up?
1578760	1581760	Well, I want Gary Busey to be in the next Star Wars.
1581760	1582760	All right.
1582760	1583760	Done.
1583760	1584760	All right.
1584760	1585760	All right.
1585760	1586760	Gary Busey's in the next Star Wars?
1586760	1587760	And Tori Amos gets her face fixed.
1587760	1588760	All right.
1588760	1589760	Thank you.
1589760	1590760	Busey, it's all possible.
1590760	1591760	Thank you.
1591760	1592760	Absolutely.
1592760	1593760	Let's hear it for Matt.
1593760	1594760	Matt, everybody.
1594760	1597960	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1597960	1601440	Jeff, you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place.
1601440	1602440	You hate liquid colognes.
1602440	1603440	Is that correct?
1603440	1604440	It's my nemesis.
1604440	1607600	It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
1607600	1613080	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just covered in sticky, wet cologne.
1613080	1618840	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear, and then my luggage smells
1618840	1621440	like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
1621440	1622440	Yeah.
1622440	1626440	But Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company that specializes in solid
1626440	1630200	colognes, shave, and shower products, all designed to make getting ready easier and
1630200	1631200	more enjoyable.
1631200	1634000	Now, when you say solid colognes, do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
1634000	1636560	Like wow, that jazz solo was solid.
1636560	1640200	You know, I do mean that, but I also mean physically solid as well.
1640200	1643760	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about a wax-based cologne that travels in a little
1643760	1650960	small package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican tit house.
1650960	1654160	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes that can go anywhere?
1654160	1658320	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill, and of course, they all smell fantastic.
1658320	1659320	Fantastic.
1659320	1662640	Like a Mexican tit house.
1662640	1666200	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.

1911480	1912880	You know, that's a very interesting phrase.
1912880	1917760	People usually speak of me as fucked up, so it makes me wonder why the world's fucked
1917760	1918760	up.
1918760	1924680	It's like polarity is more should've worn a helmet.
1924680	1925680	I do.
1925680	1935280	All right, deleted scene from Star Wars Gary Busey.
1935280	1938080	You guys didn't know you're going to come in here and get fucking high octane whose
1938080	1940280	line is anyway style improv up here.
1940280	1941560	I like to sprinkle a little in.
1941560	1942560	Yeah.
1942560	1944280	You're, you're a quadruple threat.
1944280	1945280	I don't mind.
1945280	1946280	I don't mind.
1946280	1947960	You got improv, rapping, sports knowledge.
1948040	1949040	Yeah.
1949040	1953920	And I don't mind springing a little, you know, like a little mainstream, like a really, really
1953920	1957000	tight, awesome comedy like that into the show.
1957000	1962360	I feel like Spencer was not used enough in that we, we, we, we, we, we missed user resource
1962360	1963360	there.
1963360	1964360	Spencer.
1964360	1968320	What does it sound like when, um, uh, shit is this doing the thing?
1968320	1969320	Yeah.
1969320	1970320	Yeah.
1970320	1971320	Yeah.
1971320	1972320	We found a thing that Spencer can do.
1972320	1974240	He can kind of freestyle dungeon master any kind of monster attacking you so you can make
1974240	1975240	up a, a monster.
1975240	1982200	And he instantly goes into the character description of that monster, uh, Spencer, uh, uh, uh, a,
1982200	1989160	uh, Gary Busey, uh, a guy that I don't recognize walks into the room.
1989160	1997320	He says he's from things, but you're not entirely sure he might just be one of LA's crazy people.
1997320	1998320	Sorry.
1998320	1999320	I don't watch movies.
1999320	2000320	He doesn't know who Gary Busey is.
2000320	2001320	All right.
2001320	2002320	I mean, I know who he is.
2002320	2007040	He's a guy who's famous for like acting, but like that describes many, many people.
2007040	2008040	He was in point break.
2008040	2009040	You ever see that?
2009040	2010040	What?
2010040	2012040	That was a good Keanu impression.
2012040	2013040	Shut up.
2013040	2014040	Yeah.
2014040	2017600	You, you, you don't see, you don't watch, you watch any movies.
2017600	2019520	I don't watch most movies.
2019520	2025640	If I, if someone says, do you want to watch a movie, I'll say, nope, that's a good policy.
2025640	2029120	It's kept your brain free for like all every entry in the monster manual.
2029120	2030120	Yeah.
2030120	2032320	All the other, you know, useless factoid information.
2032320	2033720	You know what an owl bear is.
2033720	2042840	You know, that you know, an owl bears armor class, no, that's 16 that might not be right.
2042840	2045120	You don't know.
2045120	2047920	In my day, armor class was a negative numbers.
2047920	2048920	Yeah.
2048920	2049920	Yeah.
2049920	2050920	It was a Thacko was a thing.
2050920	2051920	Yeah.
2051920	2052920	Good time to hit an armor class zero.
2052920	2053920	Yeah.
2053920	2054920	Yeah.
2054920	2055920	You used to actually be hard.
2055920	2056920	Spencer.
2056920	2060600	Just name a not movie reference or something.
2060600	2061600	All right.
2061600	2062600	All right.
2062600	2068040	Uh, uh, uh, divorced, uh, uh, employee of a craft store store, uh, that's the monster
2068040	2069040	that's attacking.
2069040	2073960	You hear the steps and jangles of someone with me, too many items in his apron.
2073960	2078960	You smell the whiskey before you see him, but rounding the corner is a drunken craft
2078960	2080880	employee.
2080880	2085560	He's holding handfuls of paper stickers that no doubt cost 20 times more what you'd pay
2085560	2086560	for them.
2086560	2087560	All right.
2087560	2088560	Yeah.
2088560	2089560	Yeah.
2089560	2090560	Yeah.
2090560	2091560	Yeah.
2091560	2092560	Divorced craft store.
2092560	2093560	I play.
2093560	2097160	That was a hard one.
2097160	2099120	You started drinking after the divorce.
2099120	2105200	Uh, how about, uh, Spencer, uh, Dan Harmon waking up on the tour bus.
2105200	2107720	How about that one?
2107720	2112520	The door creaks open and you can hear several people running for cover.
2112520	2116200	You hear that of the sliding privacy curtain.
2116200	2122600	And then a thump as a large figure rolls out of bed onto the floor, standing at full height.
2122600	2128600	He arranges himself before scratching his belly and moving to the next room.
2128600	2129600	That's all.
2129600	2130600	That's all.
2130600	2139760	We got to bring up the guy that is dressed, uh, as, uh, my wizard character.
2139760	2143120	There's a Dan Harmon Gandalf, uh, thing going on here.
2143120	2144520	What is your name?
2144520	2145520	Cayman.
2145520	2151840	Well, I'm on stage, uh, came in, came in, uh, for the, for the people listening, he's
2151840	2153480	wearing a blue bathrobe.
2153480	2156000	He has a, was it a scepter or a walking stick?
2156000	2157000	What do you got there?
2157000	2158840	What do you call those?
2158840	2159840	Wizard staff.
2159840	2160840	There you go.
2160840	2161840	With the kettle one light up.
2161840	2168080	Kettle one, uh, for ray of frost, he has a light up blue kettle one bottle on top of
2168080	2172480	a staff and he's got a, is that a prop or are you really drinking kettle one tonight?
2172480	2175200	I figured if I'm going to be drink, if I'm going to be dressing up like you, I should
2175200	2177120	larp and drink a vodka as well.
2177120	2181600	He's to larp and larp it up.
2181600	2182600	Live action role playing.
2182600	2185680	That's kind of what this podcast has become, Jeff, as a, as like working our relationship
2185680	2189240	troubles out on stage, bringing people up, talking in real time to the people.
2189240	2193400	We are larping for harm in town is larping.
2193400	2194800	Now did you, uh, do you live alone?
2194800	2195800	Do you have roommates or a girlfriend?
2195800	2199680	No, I live alone and I was actually supposed to come with a girl, but she canceled on me.
2199680	2205840	So would she have got, well, I see the irony in that statement too.
2205840	2208080	Would she have understood what, what, what the purpose of all this was?
2208080	2211920	No, she was completely, uh, on, she had no idea what harm in town was.
2211920	2212920	Is that why she didn't come?
2212920	2213920	Do you think possibly?
2213920	2214920	No.
2214920	2215920	Well, she said she was sick.
2215920	2216920	So that's right.
2216920	2217920	Okay.
2217920	2218920	All right.
2218920	2219920	What's your name?
2219920	2220920	Uh, grace, I believe.
2220920	2221920	Fuck you.
2221920	2222920	Grace.
2222920	2223920	Yeah.
2223920	2224920	More like clumsy.
2224920	2225920	Yeah.
2225920	2233720	Two days minimum notice grace.
2233720	2234720	How ironic.
2234720	2236600	I'm going to name you grace.
2236600	2240640	So you're out in the world and trip over people's feelings.
2240640	2244000	Go, go, go, go.
2244000	2245960	Be a bull in a China shop.
2245960	2246960	Grace.
2246960	2248560	She sounds like an awful person.
2248560	2252480	Maybe she's, maybe she's having a grace period.
2252480	2257360	She's been, she's been, she's been thriving on one on the part of the universe for, uh,
2257360	2258360	how old is she?
2258360	2259360	I don't actually know.
2259360	2267600	23 years and, uh, tonight the irony is that if she had come here, she would have avoided
2267600	2269680	that blimp accident.
2269680	2276720	Did you just curse grace with a blimp accident saying that's, that's how, you know, timelines
2276720	2277720	work and shit.
2277720	2279600	Sliding doors stuff.
2280520	2284680	If she would, if you guys Facebooked each other, you were like, okay, one last ritual
2284680	2288480	before we meet at the comedy attic, let's each send each other photos of what we're
2288480	2292680	wearing to make sure that we don't wear the same thing.
2292680	2294480	And then she's sick all of a sudden.
2294480	2300600	Ironically, though, this is the only periwinkle blue robe I could find was a woman's robe.
2300600	2302080	Is that, that's periwinkle, huh?
2302080	2303800	Well, actually, I don't know.
2303800	2306320	I, periwinkle is a hard color to find.
2306320	2309160	Oh, it's powder blue, right?
2309160	2310160	It's blue.
2310160	2316640	It's all exclusively female voices like calling out all kinds of, the room became a vocal
2316640	2324120	swatch catalog for a second, Robin's eggs, aquaphones, sing, sing, a lot of, a lot of
2324120	2328560	nurseries are going up this, this part of town this weekend.
2328560	2334560	Uh, I'm, I kind of, yeah, I would just say blue, like, but, and I, I, I, I see meavy
2334560	2335560	blue as black.
2335560	2337080	Is that a kind of color blindness or?
2337520	2338520	No, under certain light.
2338520	2340360	Cause you, you normally hang out in dark environments.
2340360	2342880	Uh, like I wore a navy blue suit.
2342880	2343880	You'd think it was black.
2343880	2344880	Yeah.
2344880	2345880	That's black, right?
2345880	2346880	Nope.
2346880	2350360	This is, uh, this is charcoal.
2350360	2351360	This is tangerine.
2351360	2356800	I mean, charcoal, that charcoal is different from black, but charcoal is totally black.
2356800	2357800	Charcoal.
2357800	2358800	No, it's smokier.
2358800	2359800	It's dumb.
2360800	2361800	It's dumb.
2361800	2363680	It seems like a dumb thing to spend your brain on.
2363680	2369360	I, I, I, uh, artists, um, what, what do you have on the kind of a pumpkin or rust?
2369360	2370360	What is this?
2370360	2371360	It's red.
2371360	2376520	It's not red, red and brown now cause yours is oranges, right?
2376520	2377520	Mine's more red.
2377520	2378520	Red.
2378520	2383440	I'd say his has a bit more orange and mine, but still pretty red.
2383440	2389000	This is made out of multiple different colors of material woven together.
2389000	2390520	Dumb.
2390520	2391520	Colors are dumb.
2391520	2402840	Colors, colors, sports, most, most bands, um, uh, horoscopes, um, uh, uh, other people,
2402840	2406720	uh, magic, um, uh, Harry Potter.
2406720	2407720	Yeah.
2407720	2411920	I knew I didn't, I didn't, I didn't come here to win a popularity contest.
2411920	2417640	Uh, uh, I mean, I saw that, that, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the hotel
2417640	2418640	rooms.
2418640	2419640	You don't mind hanging out here.
2419640	2420640	No, no, no.
2420640	2421640	Okay, good.
2421640	2424600	Uh, that last Harry Potter movie is playing in the, in the hotel rooms right now.
2424600	2425600	It's kind of in rotation.
2425600	2430720	Uh, uh, I, I can't, there's like, I made a joke, like put on the Harry Potter movie
2430720	2433120	to Aaron and she's like, Oh, I can't believe it's on.
2433120	2434480	It's like there's 900 of them.
2434480	2440160	And, and, and they're all the same, this is deathly, deathly shadows part, part seven
2440160	2441160	or whatever.
2441160	2446120	And like, like, like, they, they, they sure know how to make a war between wizards look
2446120	2448000	a lot like standing around.
2448000	2453320	Like, I don't know what, what contrivance you have to engage in before you get to this
2453320	2457780	point in, in where there's a bunch of wizards fighting a bunch of other wizards.
2457780	2461520	But I would think at that point, even a six year old could make it exciting, you know,
2461520	2463600	like there's two armies of wizards.
2463600	2466560	Now at least for this part, we could get a little interesting.
2466560	2470200	And I did see a couple of giant spiders, but they were really buried in the background.
2470640	2471960	Dumb, dumb movies.
2471960	2473800	Spencer, so much, so much.
2473800	2477560	The movie keeps, keeps, keeps jabbing you in the ribs and going, huh, how about that
2477560	2478560	book?
2478560	2479560	Huh?
2479560	2480560	Fuck you.
2480560	2481560	I know.
2481560	2482560	I didn't read the book.
2482560	2483560	I waited for the movie.
2483560	2484560	I'm not a bad person.
2484560	2485560	I don't care.
2485560	2486560	It reminds you of the book.
2486560	2487560	It's stupid.
2487560	2493000	I read the book then, if you like it so much.
2493000	2494000	Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
2494000	2495000	What are you doing here?
2495000	2499000	It's like, are you going to occupy us or aren't you?
2499800	2504800	How many cars do we have to blow up?
2504800	2505800	Cease fire.
2505800	2510600	More like an incessant fire.
2510600	2518520	Anyways, it's called rugby, but there's grass everywhere.
2518520	2524000	Why not call it Graspy?
2525000	2533000	I like that you decided that it was over too.
2533000	2534000	Wait, wait, wait.
2534000	2535000	You can top that one?
2535000	2536000	You were going to top Graspy?
2536000	2537000	No.
2537000	2538000	No, I was going to try.
2538000	2539000	Oh, do it.
2539000	2540000	Fuck it.
2540000	2541000	Let's do it.
2541000	2542000	No, no, no.
2542000	2543000	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage.
2543000	2544000	Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
2544000	2545000	Oh, hello.
2545000	2553640	Some things just don't make any sense when you look around and observe them through your
2554640	2555640	Irish eyes.
2555640	2558640	You know, why are horseshoes lucky?
2558640	2562640	The worst case scenario is they fall on your head.
2562640	2565640	The best case is they just sit there.
2565640	2566640	How is that lucky?
2566640	2568640	It's not lucky for the horse.
2568640	2570640	You think they like getting those put on them?
2570640	2571640	Probably hurts.
2571640	2572640	Fuck you guys.
2577640	2579640	Glenn Levitt.
2579640	2580640	Glenn.
2580640	2581640	Oh, that's Scottish.
2582640	2584640	What's the difference between Irish and Scottish?
2584640	2585640	You ever wonder?
2585640	2587640	It all comes down to the skirts.
2587640	2592640	It's like, you know, I'm Irish Jerry Seinfeld.
2593640	2595640	Potato famine.
2596640	2598640	I mean, what?
2598640	2600640	So what if the potatoes ran out and have a hot dog?
2600640	2601640	It's stupid.
2602640	2604640	It's so dumb.
2604640	2607640	That's more offensive to Jerry Seinfeld than to Irish people.
2608640	2609640	Yeah.
2609640	2612640	Well, he's had years to write stuff down.
2612640	2613640	Clayman?
2613640	2614640	Cayman.
2614640	2615640	Cayman.
2615640	2616640	Yeah.
2616640	2617640	Should be Clayman.
2617640	2618640	Yeah, I hear that.
2618640	2620640	Bill Clayman.
2620640	2621640	That's my Alan Rickman.
2621640	2622640	Oh.
2622640	2624640	Oh, so your professor sneaked out?
2624640	2625640	No, no.
2625640	2626640	That's from Die Hard.
2626640	2627640	Oh.
2627640	2631640	When Bruce Willis asks him, I never got your name.
2631640	2636640	And then Bruce Willis is looking at the sign behind him and then, you know, Alan Rickman
2636640	2642640	without looking at the sign says, Clay, Bill Clay.
2642640	2647640	And then they engage in this beautiful dance between hero and villain.
2647640	2649640	But they show Clay W., right?
2649640	2650640	So his name might be William.
2650640	2652640	So he puts an extra little thing in there.
2652640	2653640	Yeah, a little fucking reality spin.
2653640	2655640	Like, because he's done his work.
2655640	2657640	And this is like the hero of the villain doing this ballet.
2657640	2662640	And, you know, it's like Bruce Willis starts to walk away.
2662640	2665640	And Alan Rickman goes.
2665640	2668640	The what?
2668640	2669640	The huh?
2669640	2670640	No, no, no.
2670640	2671640	That's shoot the glass.
2671640	2672640	That's later.
2672640	2673640	Oh.
2673640	2674640	And then he points the gun at him.
2674640	2679640	And Bruce Willis goes, it's a hell of an accident, Hans.
2679640	2681640	You could be in fucking Hollywood with that accent.
2681640	2683640	And then he tries to shoot him like he did with Takagi.
2683640	2684640	Click.
2684640	2685640	Oh, what do you think?
2685640	2686640	I'm a fucking idiot.
2686640	2687640	He takes the gun.
2687640	2688640	It's amazing.
2688640	2689640	It's a great movie.
2689640	2690640	You should rent it.
2690640	2691640	Bill Clay.
2691640	2692640	He came in.
2692640	2693640	Have you seen Die Hard?
2693640	2694640	Die Hard?
2694640	2695640	I have, many times.
2695640	2696640	Die Hard not in the Criterion Collection of films.
2696640	2698640	What, Dan, do you consider it a Christmas movie?
2698640	2699640	Yeah, yeah.
2699640	2701640	I think it's a great Christmas movie.
2701640	2703640	But I also think it's a great, great movie, plain and simple.
2703640	2707640	Not such a great movie, Armageddon in the Criterion Collection.
2707640	2709640	Armageddon's in the Criterion Collection?
2709640	2710640	Yeah.
2710640	2713640	Yep.
2713640	2714640	Yep.
2714640	2716640	Fucking weird.
2716640	2718640	The Rock also in the Criterion Collection.
2718640	2719640	Well, yeah.
2719640	2727640	Now I'm starting to, yeah, there's some kind of, some payola going on here.
2727640	2730640	More like cash-terion.
2730640	2731640	Right?
2731640	2733640	There's some kind of something happening here, right?
2733640	2734640	Cayman?
2734640	2735640	Indeed.
2735640	2737640	Cayman, what do you do?
2737640	2738640	I'm a scientist, actually.
2738640	2739640	For real?
2739640	2740640	Yeah.
2740640	2741640	In what field?
2741640	2743640	Kind of a combination of fields.
2743640	2748640	I study planets around other stars and what they need to be able to support life.
2748640	2751640	So is that planetary geologist?
2751640	2753640	It's like a combination of geology and astronomy.
2753640	2754640	Really?
2754640	2755640	How cool.
2755640	2756640	Yeah.
2756640	2757640	That's fascinating.
2757640	2760640	So you look for planets that might be like earth-like planets that could sustain life
2760640	2762640	based on their proximity to their star?
2762640	2765640	Yeah, and what they're made of and all sorts of other things.
2765640	2768640	And we're finding these new planets all the time now, right?
2768640	2771640	Yeah, we've got like over 750 confirmed ones.
2771640	2774640	That are confirmed possible earth type?
2774640	2775640	No.
2775640	2779640	Earth-like, we're actually having a very hard time finding them.
2779640	2780640	What are the 750?
2780640	2781640	750 what?
2781640	2785640	Do you mean just planets, whether they're the size of Jupiter or bigger than Earth?
2785640	2786640	Just planets.
2786640	2787640	I thought we'd confirm.
2787640	2789640	I thought we're finding planets by the thousands and thousands.
2789640	2791640	Right, but we haven't confirmed them yet.
2791640	2792640	Oh, I see.
2792640	2793640	How does a planet get confirmed?
2793640	2795640	You have to hit it with a BB gun.
2795640	2797640	Right, yeah.
2797640	2798640	Takes forever.
2798640	2799640	Yeah.
2799640	2803640	They have two little flags hanging from their hips and you've got to pull one off.
2804640	2806640	How do you confirm it?
2806640	2810640	Well, you just go back and look with another nerd telescope.
2810640	2811640	Oh, so it's like...
2811640	2812640	See if it, check if you're into it.
2812640	2814640	Yeah, it could be a smudge on one guy's telescope.
2814640	2815640	Yeah, exactly, right.
2815640	2816640	Those Swedish fuckers, okay.
2816640	2818640	What telescope do you guys use?
2818640	2823640	I don't actually use a telescope, so I steal other people's data, so...
2823640	2824640	Badass.
2824640	2825640	What is your task?
2825640	2826640	What's your role in all this?
2826640	2830640	So, I look more at the chemistry end and say,
2830640	2833640	if you've got this much oxygen and this much other stuff,
2833640	2835640	can you make a planet that is habitable?
2835640	2836640	Right.
2836640	2841640	And there's nothing in the near or just the universe that you think could sustain life?
2841640	2843640	Oh, I think...
2843640	2844640	Possibly.
2844640	2847640	Yeah, I would say it would be weird if Earth was the only one.
2847640	2848640	Oh, certainly, yeah.
2848640	2852640	But even in our own solar system, there's like Enceladus or there's some moons,
2852640	2853640	you know, like that.
2853640	2855640	They think that we know there's liquid water there,
2855640	2858640	and there's more extreme environments on Earth where life does exist,
2858640	2862640	or at least did, so it'd be logical to think it's possible that, right?
2862640	2863640	Right.
2863640	2867640	And my research is saying, what does it take to get to that point of making it possible?
2867640	2872640	And does your expertise probably stop somewhere short of my next question,
2872640	2876640	which is, on these planets that are capable of...
2876640	2879640	They have a kind of an Earth-approximate environment,
2879640	2883640	and then carbon-based life springs up on them.
2883640	2888640	How kind of inevitable is sentience?
2888640	2892640	Or is that like a weird flash in the pan, too, that it would be like...
2892640	2894640	This is a really dumb question.
2894640	2897640	So it's definitely more of a biology question, but...
2897640	2898640	I said so!
2898640	2899640	Well, but...
2899640	2901640	I'm a scientist, too!
2901640	2902640	Yeah, but...
2902640	2904640	Aww.
2904640	2907640	Ooh!
2907640	2909640	Dan, I thought you had a biology degree.
2909640	2912640	No, not a degree, no.
2913640	2915640	So, we don't know.
2915640	2918640	But there's this really cool thing called the Drake Equation,
2918640	2922640	which is sort of a calculation of how likely would sentient life be,
2922640	2925640	and one of the parameters is, what are the chances of sentience?
2925640	2926640	And we don't know.
2926640	2927640	So that's a cool question.
2927640	2928640	I mean, it's kind of...
2928640	2929640	Because it's like...
2929640	2933640	We think with our sentience that it's inevitable,
2933640	2936640	even if you're not a religious person,
2936640	2941640	because I tend to think with the atheist part of my brain, even,
2941640	2944640	that, oh, of course, a planet that lives and breathes
2944640	2946640	and that has life crop up on it...
2946640	2949640	Of course, the final goal is the biological weapon notice...
2949640	2952640	Can I stop you for a second?
2952640	2956640	Just realize you're talking to a guy in a bathrobe on a stage.
2956640	2958640	So, who's the crazy one?
2958640	2960640	You said you were a scientist.
2960640	2962640	I can say anything I want.
2962640	2964640	I have confidentiality, right?
2964640	2967640	He might not be a scientist.
2967640	2970640	Wait, he works at our hotel!
2970640	2974640	Wait, that's my bro...
2974640	2978640	He's wearing your shoes.
2978640	2980640	We haven't really had a stalker yet on the tour.
2980640	2982640	No, far from a stalker.
2982640	2983640	Well, I mean...
2983640	2985640	I drove pretty far to get here, so it's kind of hard to...
2985640	2987640	Well, that's the thing.
2987640	2988640	People drive...
2988640	2992640	I talk to everybody after the show that's willing to stick around that long,
2992640	2999640	and as long as they have some kind of flu on their hands...
2999640	3001640	That's red.
3001640	3004640	One of your girlfriend's red hairs has been hanging off your chin
3004640	3006640	like some sort of weird tinder.
3006640	3008640	Was that really distracting all the time?
3008640	3009640	I'm sorry.
3009640	3011640	Look at this!
3013640	3015640	Just say something next time.
3015640	3017640	Not that this will happen again a lot, but...
3017640	3018640	Just say something.
3018640	3020640	If I'd have said something, you would have fumbled with it,
3020640	3021640	you never would have got it out.
3021640	3023640	I'm telling even then.
3023640	3024640	They're the ones that we're dealing with.
3024640	3026640	The applause that occurred when you did that
3026640	3028640	makes me feel really bad.
3028640	3030640	Makes me feel like I zipped up my fly.
3030640	3032640	Well, the thing is, from my vantage point,
3032640	3034640	because I'm staged left of you, and the hair, I think, was staged right,
3034640	3036640	and it was kind of falling little by little.
3036640	3037640	I just like...
3037640	3039640	One of the hairs of your beard was growing.
3039640	3040640	And it was like...
3040640	3042640	Something fucking weird is going on.
3042640	3043640	When you're really talking to somebody,
3043640	3046640	and they just got the slightest white fleck on their lip,
3046640	3048640	and it's such a bummer because you don't want to...
3048640	3050640	Right now, every moment.
3050640	3053640	It's like, it's not their fault, it's not your fault,
3053640	3055640	it's not your responsibility, it's not theirs.
3055640	3056640	You don't know what to do.
3056640	3058640	They're talking, and they have a fleck of foam on their lip,
3058640	3060640	and it's just like...
3060640	3061640	Yeah.
3061640	3063640	I don't know.
3063640	3066640	There was a guy in Amsterdam that was telling us about windmills,
3066640	3068640	and he wasn't speaking in English.
3068640	3069640	He was speaking in...
3069640	3071640	Whenever they speak there, windmill talk.
3071640	3075640	And he was just talking, and he was all excited about windmills
3075640	3077640	and how they mill things using the wind power,
3077640	3080640	and just this little bubble of spit came out
3080640	3083640	and just rolled over his lip, and it was just there.
3083640	3084640	And I was just...
3084640	3087640	I don't speak as a sweetmark or whatever.
3087640	3088640	They talk anyway.
3088640	3089640	Dutch.
3089640	3092640	So I was just focused on this thing and his lip,
3092640	3094640	and that just popped into my head when he...
3094640	3096640	I didn't want them to be subjected to that.
3096640	3097640	If there's a hair, anything.
3097640	3099640	Could be a piece of egg in your forehead.
3099640	3102640	You know, we need rules for that stuff.
3102640	3104640	Or just maybe a friend comes up and takes it off
3104640	3106640	and gets a big laugh out of it.
3106640	3107640	But you can't always do that.
3107640	3109640	Sometimes you're talking to a guy about windmills, you know?
3109640	3111640	And sometimes, who cares?
3111640	3114640	I ate in a restaurant on that same vacation.
3114640	3115640	I was in London.
3115640	3117640	I had Christmas dinner with Rob Schraven,
3117640	3119640	his wife, Kate Freund, and my girlfriend, Erin,
3119640	3121640	having a little couple's Christmas vacation in Europe
3121640	3122640	because we're fancy.
3122640	3125640	And we were in this restaurant in London,
3125640	3128640	and a little bit of a tumult at the entrance,
3128640	3131640	and people file in, and then this wheelchair comes in.
3131640	3133640	Stephen Hawking.
3133640	3134640	Wow.
3134640	3136640	Yeah, he ate, like, nine feet from me.
3136640	3139640	Everybody was, like, trying to take pictures of him.
3139640	3142640	I didn't want to be like a fly on a turd.
3142640	3144640	You can't really walk up and go, excuse me,
3144640	3146640	can I have a word with Mr. Hawking real quick?
3146640	3147640	Schraven kept saying, he kept going,
3147640	3149640	go tell him you created community.
3149640	3153640	He was on The Simpsons.
3153640	3155640	It's like a 40% chance.
3155640	3158640	First of all, thank you, Rob.
3158640	3160640	But second of all, it doesn't.
3160640	3164640	Also, if I were Stephen Hawking and a guy came over
3164640	3167640	and said, like, if you came over, you're a scientist,
3167640	3168640	I think.
3168640	3169640	I am, yeah.
3169640	3173640	Then I would feel OK going up to him.
3173640	3176640	I kind of understand some of the things you talk about
3176640	3179640	and why you are famous.
3179640	3181640	And I teach a class or something.
3181640	3184640	If I had a photo on my wall of me posing with you,
3184640	3186640	that would be cool.
3186640	3189640	And then he'd be like, yeah, it's OK.
3189640	3192640	But regular people coming up to him and going,
3192640	3195640	hey, wheelchair guy.
3196640	3201640	I know you invented black holes, but I don't understand
3201640	3202640	anything he does.
3202640	3205640	I don't understand why he's, you know,
3205640	3208640	I feel like I'm not allowed to take a picture of him,
3208640	3210640	especially because he's in a wheelchair.
3213640	3217640	If he were just a nice ambulatory dude having dinner,
3217640	3219640	would you have felt comfortable walking up to him then?
3219640	3220640	I'm not sure.
3220640	3222640	That's a really interesting question.
3222640	3225640	Because part of Stephen Hawking's charisma is like,
3225640	3228640	oh, God, he's all brain.
3228640	3229640	We're all thinking it.
3229640	3232640	It's amazing that it's like this cool poetic thing.
3232640	3235640	Like, oh, man, God took all his body power
3235640	3240640	and put it into his head like a little balloon
3240640	3243640	and put all the air into one section of it.
3243640	3245640	It's neat.
3245640	3248640	I hear something that he keeps being found with bruises
3248640	3251640	on his body and he keeps saying, oh, I fell out of my chair.
3252640	3255640	But the injuries aren't consistent with somebody
3255640	3257640	falling out of a chair, and they think that it may be
3257640	3259640	kind of S&M kind of stuff.
3259640	3261640	Has anybody heard that?
3261640	3262640	Yeah.
3262640	3265640	It's like sex clubs and shit.
3265640	3268640	If your body is very limited in its movement
3268640	3270640	and probably limited in its sensation,
3270640	3273640	sex might involve a broom handle just fucking whack.
3273640	3278640	And also, if anyone deserves it, it's him.
3279640	3282640	Let him get us Jolly Rogers.
3282640	3285640	Let him get us Jolly Rogers says a gay pirate over here.
3288640	3290640	Why add Rogers?
3290640	3292640	Is that an Indiana thing?
3292640	3298640	It's just jollies in Los Angeles.
3298640	3301640	Maybe we have more shit to do.
3301640	3303640	Jolly Rogers.
3303640	3305640	He's sucking me nuts.
3309640	3312640	Why are pirates always getting their nuts sucked?
3314640	3316640	Oh, I'm Jerry McSeinfeld.
3319640	3321640	Why is it pieces of eight?
3321640	3323640	Why not just take eight pieces?
3324640	3325640	No.
3325640	3327640	Hey, cast a wide nut.
3327640	3329640	I'm going to hit a couple.
3329640	3331640	I'll get another Graspy.
3331640	3333640	Graspy was a goodie. That was a goodie.
3333640	3334640	That was fucking good.
3334640	3336640	It's so good you didn't even get it until I said it.
3336640	3337640	Oh, I got it.
3337640	3338640	I said, why did they call it rugby?
3338640	3339640	There's grass everywhere.
3339640	3340640	And you went, whoa.
3340640	3341640	And then I said, call it Graspy.
3341640	3343640	And you're like, whoa.
3343640	3346640	And I was like, yeah, I fucking.
3346640	3347640	I got it.
3347640	3348640	I got it.
3348640	3349640	All right.
3349640	3352640	Well, I mean, I remembered it different.
3352640	3354640	I felt like I felt like hitting the 710 split.
3354640	3356640	Like, like, it was kind of like I hit the thing.
3356640	3357640	And then you were like, what?
3357640	3358640	And there was a delay.
3358640	3359640	And then the ball went into the thing.
3359640	3360640	I'm mixing sports.
3360640	3361640	Is this sports corner again?
3361640	3362640	Yeah.
3362640	3363640	All right.
3367640	3368640	Break down.
3368640	3369640	Rap and sports corner.
3369640	3371640	Sports corner introduction or rap?
3371640	3372640	You don't know.
3372640	3373640	It's a Schrodinger's rap.
3373640	3375640	Is it an intro or a regular rap?
3375640	3377640	You don't know until the positrons collide
3377640	3378640	with the megatrons.
3378640	3379640	It's going to open the box.
3379640	3380640	It's theoretical.
3380640	3383640	Fuck your momma like her name was hypothetical.
3383640	3385640	It's the same word, basically.
3385640	3387640	Fuck your mom like her name was Pythagoras.
3387640	3390640	Fuck your mom like she was a Stegosaurus kind of.
3390640	3392640	So scientific words doesn't matter.
3392640	3394640	OK, thank you.
3394640	3395640	Science rap.
3398640	3401640	Schrodinger's rap.
3401640	3407640	I won't question what you guys deem worthy of applause.
3407640	3411640	But I just won't.
3411640	3414640	But you disagree with that with that applause.
3414640	3418640	Frankly, sirs and madams, I disagree with your applause there.
3418640	3422640	I wouldn't let me get away that easy, is what I'm saying.
3422640	3424640	You paid top dollar.
3424640	3425640	What were the tickets?
3426640	3427640	20 bucks?
3427640	3428640	OK, that's pretty good.
3428640	3429640	Who drove that?
3429640	3430640	What?
3430640	3431640	100.
3431640	3432640	Oh, you're joking.
3432640	3433640	Some girl said, what?
3433640	3435640	I paid 100.
3435640	3437640	And it was worth it, right?
3437640	3439640	Who drove the furthest?
3439640	3441640	Sometimes that's an embarrassing thing to answer.
3441640	3442640	Some people are proud of it.
3442640	3443640	Some people are ashamed.
3443640	3446640	I've talked to people who drove six hours to gigs and stuff.
3446640	3449640	We got Louisville, Cincinnati, Columbus,
3449640	3453640	and those are like how far away I'm in.
3453640	3454640	Four or five.
3454640	3458640	It's kind of hard to have this conversation with 100 people.
3458640	3461640	And what's your name?
3461640	3465640	Jim Herman Nancy.
3465640	3469640	But yeah, I think that's amazing when people drive all that way.
3469640	3472640	And then sometimes I go, are you staying at a hotel here tonight?
3472640	3475640	And they say, no, they're going to drive all the way back.
3475640	3478640	And then sometimes I reach out and I take their hand and I say,
3478640	3479640	you're staying with me.
3480640	3483640	Whoa.
3483640	3488640	And whether it's a dude or a girl or hopefully both,
3488640	3492640	Aaron and I take him back to our hotel room at the Comfort Inn
3492640	3496640	and we put on some Chardet.
3496640	3500640	We smoke a J.
3500640	3502640	Do a little TM.
3502640	3507640	It's Transcendental Meditation.
3508640	3511640	And basically enact that SNL sketch about the guys that like Quantro.
3511640	3515640	OK.
3515640	3517640	All right, Caiman, what do we do for you?
3517640	3518640	What do you want?
3518640	3519640	What do I want?
3519640	3520640	I'm kidding.
3520640	3521640	I don't remember.
3521640	3522640	No, I mean, I win.
3522640	3523640	What do you want?
3523640	3524640	I just didn't mean to say it in a weird way.
3524640	3526640	I'll take some more vodka at the very least.
3526640	3527640	I don't mean to steamroll it.
3527640	3528640	No, no, no, no.
3528640	3529640	You've earned it.
3529640	3531640	You're under these lights.
3531640	3534640	Drink your science spinach.
3534640	3536640	Well, it's Monday night.
3536640	3538640	Every night is drink night for scientists.
3538640	3540640	It's what powers science, basically.
3540640	3541640	Really?
3541640	3542640	Yeah.
3542640	3545640	So like most science gets done Tuesday morning or?
3545640	3547640	Most science gets done at the bar, I'd say.
3547640	3548640	Oh.
3548640	3550640	You guys get drunk and then the...
3550640	3555640	Are there any science bars in town where?
3555640	3558640	The slide rule.
3558640	3560640	The bronze slide rule.
3560640	3562640	The bronze slide rule.
3562640	3568640	The graduated cylinder.
3568640	3573640	The nanoshot.
3573640	3574640	The flask.
3574640	3575640	Okay.
3575640	3576640	The Erlenmeyer flask.
3576640	3577640	The dot connector.
3577640	3580640	That's science-y.
3580640	3584640	Schrodinger's hangover.
3584640	3586640	E equals Jim Beam squared.
3586640	3591640	No, that's a drink special at that place.
3591640	3593640	Wine...
3593640	3594640	Stein's?
3594640	3595640	Yeah.
3595640	3597640	Dumb.
3597640	3599640	Come on, anybody got one?
3599640	3607840	The
3607840	3608840	That's not nice.
3608840	3609840	That's Garrett with one R.
3609840	3611640	It's from Nashville, right?
3611640	3612640	Yeah.
3612640	3613640	It's the...
3613640	3615640	What's the one where the lady stands in the bar making a...
3615640	3616640	Coyote ugly?
3616640	3617640	Coyote ugly?
3617640	3618640	Yeah, yeah.
3618640	3619640	Coyote ugly science bars.
3619640	3620640	That was too long.
3620640	3621640	Holy crap.
3621640	3622640	Yeah.
3622640	3623640	That was a Mobius strip.
3623640	3624640	I like that.
3624640	3625640	The Mobius strip club.
3625640	3626640	The Mobius strip club.
3626640	3627640	There's only one titty, but it goes...
3627640	3628640	It goes all around.
3628640	3629640	There's no nipple.
3629640	3630640	Infinite titties.
3630640	3631640	Yeah.
3631640	3635640	You get a lap dance, but it's like all of a sudden you're on her lap and it's like...
3635640	3638640	Put your hands together for Tesseract.
3639640	3641640	She's a wrinkle in time, boys.
3643640	3644640	Get your tips out.
3644640	3647640	She's got infinite titties, but we don't have infinite time.
3654640	3657640	Remember, Heisenberg's principle still applies if you touch it.
3657640	3658640	It's a real thing.
3658640	3659640	It's a real thing.
3659640	3660640	It's a real thing.
3660640	3661640	It's a real thing.
3661640	3662640	It's a real thing.
3662640	3663640	It's a real thing.
3663640	3664640	It's a real thing.
3664640	3665640	It's a real thing.
3665640	3666640	It's a real thing.
3667640	3670640	If Sheisenberg's principle still applies, if you touch it, it stops being allowed.
3674640	3677640	Don't forget, you can get a private lap dance in the wormhole.
3678640	3680640	Who knows what goes back there.
3680640	3682640	Get your super strings out.
3685640	3686640	Yeah, I know.
3686640	3687640	It's getting grody.
3689640	3690640	It's Singularity Night.
3690640	3691640	Anybody who came alone.
3694640	3695640	All right.
3695640	3696640	All right.
3696640	3697640	So what's the...
3699640	3701640	We've got a scientist up on stage, Jeff.
3702640	3703640	Pop quiz.
3703640	3704640	Okay.
3704640	3705640	Yeah, yeah.
3705640	3706640	You ask him science questions and try to stump him.
3706640	3707640	Okay.
3710640	3711640	Oh, boy.
3712640	3716640	Could science ever...
3717640	3718640	Well, I mean...
3719640	3720640	Fight the predator?
3723640	3724640	Who would win in a fight?
3725640	3726640	Science or the predator?
3729640	3731640	Science could at least see the predator.
3731640	3732640	Right.
3732640	3733640	And measure him.
3733640	3734640	But whether we could fight him or not.
3734640	3735640	Or her.
3735640	3736640	I don't know.
3736640	3737640	Right.
3737640	3738640	Nice.
3738640	3739640	All right.
3739640	3740640	Scientific, very open-minded.
3740640	3741640	Predator might be a lady.
3741640	3742640	Social science.
3742640	3743640	All right.
3743640	3744640	Well, let's have a hand for Kamen.
3744640	3745640	Kamen, everybody.
3745640	3746640	And send it back to his lab.
3752640	3753640	Yeehaw.
3754640	3755640	Science.
3756640	3759640	Science, science, science.
3760640	3763640	Well, two plus two is four.
3763640	3766640	And a boot plus a boot is a shoe.
3766640	3769640	I'm a funky science cowboy.
3770640	3771640	How do you do?
3772640	3776640	I'd like to take you back to my ranch shack and put you on your back.
3776640	3778640	Give a double-slide rule track.
3778640	3780640	Fuck your butt and lick your nuts.
3780640	3783640	Put my hat on the foot of your bed.
3784640	3786640	Not much of rhyming happening.
3787640	3793640	But I got a big bowl crappin' him out in the back with my Carl Sagan shack science cowboy.
3796640	3798640	Outer space is the place for me.
3798640	3801640	Got a big green face and old TV.
3801640	3803640	Got a big boot cowboy.
3803640	3805640	Boot fork, boot plate.
3806640	3809640	Line dancin', square dancin'.
3809640	3812640	Four lines make a square.
3813640	3814640	I played the short version.
3814640	3815640	I fucked up.
3815640	3818640	You got a big bowl crappin' him?
3826640	3828640	You fucked his butt.
3829640	3831640	Licked his nuts.
3832640	3835640	But you put your hat in the foot of his bed.
3836640	3839640	Because you're a science cowboy.
3840640	3842640	It's what you do. It's called peer review.
3843640	3845640	It's a scientific principle.
3847640	3849640	His ass was the control.
3849640	3850640	I'll see.
3851640	3853640	The hypothesis is over.
3853640	3855640	My hat's on your bed. You got fucked.
3857640	3858640	It's a law now.
3862640	3865640	Science. Nobody ever understands this when I say this.
3865640	3867640	Science is like the best religion.
3867640	3870640	Scientists get offended by that because they're like, we're not a religion.
3870640	3873640	And of course religious people don't want to think that science is a religion.
3873640	3876640	But I mean, religion should be like...
3876640	3880640	How much more religious can you get than trying to figure out how everything works?
3880640	3885640	And everybody joining hands and moving toward the center of the universe
3885640	3888640	and trying to find like corner God.
3888640	3890640	Either he's going to be there or nothing will be there.
3890640	3893640	In which case nothing is God. Who cares? It's still awesome.
3893640	3897640	Just like playing peek-a-boo with the origins of everything
3897640	3901640	and not letting it escape by calling each other out on everything
3901640	3903640	and publishing all your findings and being open source
3903640	3906640	and kneeling before this altar of these rules that say,
3906640	3909640	this is how you figure shit out.
3909640	3912640	Always be careful. Always be calling yourself out on your own bullshit.
3912640	3914640	Otherwise someone will also call you out on it.
3914640	3916640	It's a beautiful little...
3916640	3919640	And they have little outfits. They have little white coats.
3919640	3922640	Even if they're not doing anything that involves...
3922640	3924640	It's kind of priestly. It's kind of clerical.
3924640	3928640	And it is the new religion. I mean, obviously for better or for worse.
3928640	3931640	But some people use that as an excuse to get all jaded and cynical.
3931640	3935640	They're like, oh, there is no God. Well, yeah, there's not a Santa Claus God.
3935640	3940640	We know that. We disproved that like when we dug up a dinosaur bone.
3940640	3952640	But you don't have to be an asshole just because your mom was wrong.
3952640	3956640	Yeah, we have hover cars and stuff.
3956640	3958640	Now more than ever, don't be a dick.
3958640	3961640	Because you could hit more people with a hover car.
3961640	3963640	You could get bombs that could blow up the whole world.
3963640	3965640	You'd be a good person.
3966640	3969640	Genghis Khan would do a lot of damage these days.
3975640	3979640	Scientists have to... They're the only ones that can save us, I think.
3984640	3990640	If they adopt a kind of humanist perspective and go, okay, look, we're a group of scientists.
3990640	3994640	And we've decided we've got to be cool to one another.
3994640	3997640	No one else has any power. Nobody's listening to anybody else.
3997640	4001640	Because the other people that are saying you have to be cool to one another are also hiding rapists.
4001640	4004640	They're not... They can't be trusted. They're weird.
4004640	4008640	They say that the Bible's a newspaper. They're like backward.
4011640	4012640	Don't be evil.
4012640	4016640	Which means just don't hurt other people because it's your species.
4016640	4021640	That's scientific. Protect the DNA.
4021640	4026640	We were a nearly extinct species and we were in God's crosshairs so many times.
4026640	4029640	This planet's been trying to kill us forever.
4029640	4034640	We're a freak. We're like the Harry Potter of species.
4035640	4039640	We were not supposed to be walking around with these big melons on top of our shoulders.
4039640	4042640	We took weird risks to get where we are.
4042640	4046640	But there are people that say that competition between humans,
4046640	4048640	there are people that think that's what makes us advance.
4048640	4054640	That human conflict, that's what propels progress.
4054640	4059640	Maybe that was true for 6,000 years and now it has to stop being true.
4059640	4064640	It's like we're choking on each other. We're sleeping on top of each other.
4064640	4069640	If you also want to stab somebody, it's like a lot of people are going to get stabbed.
4069640	4073640	When we were tribal and you were walking around and you encountered another tribe,
4073640	4077640	maybe the instinct to not all lay down together and have half as many berries,
4077640	4081640	maybe that was a bad idea. Maybe it was important to slit each other's throats
4081640	4084640	and whoever picks berries better survived that day.
4084640	4089640	But we're in a tour bus now. If I get berries on the mind
4089640	4092640	and a switchblade in my hand, you're a dead man.
4092640	4095640	It's more important that we figure out a set of rules so we can all have some berries.
4095640	4098640	And there's also too many berries. We know how to make a million berries.
4098640	4101640	We make fake berries. There's a whole store every five miles
4101640	4104640	full of weird Frankenberries. Thank you, sir.
4104640	4110640	He knows what I'm talking about.
4110640	4115640	Don't forget blueberry. It's not that kind of dialogue.
4115640	4120640	It's not just say anything. But how are you supposed to know until you try?
4120640	4122640	Just yell out the names of products. It's fine.
4122640	4126640	I heard Listerine. Bula hoop.
4126640	4129640	He's mad at his dad. It's fine.
4130640	4133640	God knows I don't have anything to say.
4133640	4135640	What was I talking about? Scientists?
4135640	4140640	I don't know. You're talking about tribal people stabbing each other in berries.
4140640	4146640	Now that we are seven billion strong, now that we know how to make buildings float,
4146640	4149640	almost, look it up.
4149640	4152640	We're almost about to be able to clone each other,
4152640	4156640	and computers are almost smarter than us, and all this shit's coming to a head.
4156640	4160640	We've got to get our shit together, not physically, like emotionally.
4160640	4164640	We've got to get our shit together spiritually, for lack of a better word.
4164640	4168640	We have to know when this next catastrophe happens, like what our priorities are.
4168640	4174640	It's about to happen. We've got a couple days left, Jeff. Three days left.
4174640	4176640	When does this podcast drop?
4176640	4178640	Four days from now.
4178640	4180640	We really should have speed that up.
4180640	4184640	I hope you find it in a bottle on dry land.
4185640	4188640	I want to be a cult leader.
4188640	4192640	We'll work on that as we head back home.
4192640	4194640	I think right now it's time to...
4196640	4197640	Oh, really?
4197640	4198640	Jim Jones.
4198640	4201640	Oh, really? Jim Jones is from Indiana?
4205640	4210640	This guy says Jim Jones was a Sunday school teacher at his grandma's church.
4210640	4212640	Wow. Is your grandma alive?
4212640	4213640	Yes.
4213640	4215640	Okay, good, good.
4215640	4217640	Jesus. Holy smoke.
4217640	4220640	Any other infamous Hoosiers?
4220640	4221640	John Challenger?
4221640	4222640	I know.
4222640	4224640	John Challenger?
4224640	4225640	Larry Bird?
4225640	4226640	Larry Bird.
4226640	4227640	Larry Bird?
4227640	4230640	Notorious baby-raper?
4230640	4233640	Ed Gein.
4233640	4234640	Huh, Ed Gein?
4234640	4235640	No.
4235640	4238640	Greg Kinnear?
4238640	4241640	The infamous Greg Kinnear.
4242640	4243640	John Mellencamp.
4243640	4244640	John Mellencamp.
4244640	4246640	I saw that on Wikipedia.
4246640	4248640	John Mellencamp still lives here, right?
4248640	4249640	Michael Jackson?
4249640	4250640	Gary Indiana.
4250640	4252640	Gary Indiana from Indiana?
4256640	4259640	Not Louisiana, Paris, France, New York, or Rome.
4259640	4260640	But Gary Indiana.
4260640	4262640	Gary Indiana.
4262640	4263640	Gary Indiana.
4263640	4265640	My home sweet home.
4267640	4268640	Jeez, wow.
4268640	4270640	Big music man following here.
4273640	4274640	Yeah.
4274640	4281640	I mean, they have to keep a, they're hearing a neck and neck competition with Oklahoma for mentions in a musical.
4283640	4289640	They gotta, like, if they let it slip in this state, it's like, everyone's gonna, oh, that wonderful musical, where they mention that state.
4289640	4292640	Indiana is 14th in musical mentions.
4294640	4297640	All right, D&D time, everybody. It's D&D time.
4298640	4299640	All right.
4299640	4301640	Can we get Aaron up here?
4301640	4303640	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
4303640	4304640	Aaron McGathey.
4304640	4307640	Also, a guy named Bland has some dice for me.
4307640	4308640	Bland?
4308640	4309640	Yeah.
4309640	4310640	His name is Bland.
4310640	4311640	The dice are not Bland, however.
4311640	4312640	Bland.
4312640	4314640	Is it Bland, like B-L-A-N-D?
4316640	4317640	All right.
4317640	4320640	A gentleman has come on stage carrying a satchel.
4320640	4321640	Thank you, Bland.
4321640	4323640	And he has a Pringles can over his dick.
4323640	4326640	He's wearing a Pringles can out of his dick.
4326640	4328640	Do people ever call you Pringles dick?
4328640	4329640	Some.
4330640	4331640	Yeah?
4334640	4336640	Oh, the flavor is even better.
4336640	4338640	Did you pick out that can?
4338640	4340640	Yeah, nice, specifically.
4343640	4346640	Uh-oh, someone's gonna get the Jolly Rogers.
4349640	4352640	Oh, no, guys, it's a donation to a kids' charity.
4352640	4354640	Oh, chicken noodle can.
4354640	4357640	Wow, that is some meta shit.
4358640	4360640	For those of you who have no idea what's going on,
4360640	4362640	I kind of do.
4362640	4367640	We have a song about Pringles dick that we sing on the bus
4367640	4370640	and also a song where you hold a Pringles can.
4370640	4372640	Wait, how did you hear that, too?
4372640	4373640	You just put it through your fly?
4373640	4375640	Yeah.
4375640	4377640	Well, you probably have, like, a big dick in the way
4377640	4378640	when you do this stuff.
4378640	4381640	I've been able to do this for years.
4381640	4384640	Here I am.
4411640	4414640	Hey, guys, you heard some of the songs from the push-ups
4414640	4415640	that you've already heard.
4415640	4417640	If you want to learn more about Pringles,
4417640	4419640	put them in the comments below.
4419640	4420640	And if you want to learn more about Pringles,
4420640	4422640	send them to Chat and Cook.
4422640	4424640	If you have any questions or if you would like to get more
4424640	4426640	about Pringles,
4426640	4428640	send them to our website,
4428640	4430640	and we'll get more information.
4432640	4434640	T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T!
4434640	4436640	T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-T!
4436640	4439640	Chicken noodle, man, you got to cross the river, Jordan!
4439640	4442640	Chicken noodle soup and double crumbles go away!
4442640	4444640	Whoo!
4448640	4450640	Bland, everybody.
4450640	4454640	Giving the gift of a chicken noodle can outside of a Pringles can.
4454640	4459640	We have to write a song that fits inside a chicken noodle soup can.
4459640	4462640	And then it's like the Russian nesting dolls.
4462640	4463640	Yeah.
4463640	4465640	But I was just thinking, Bland, I am so sorry
4465640	4467640	about the either already having occurred
4467640	4469640	or imminent homicide of your parents.
4471640	4474640	Bland the fourth, your dad,
4474640	4477640	meaning like, did your dad name four kids Bland?
4477640	4480640	It's Bland with no D, right?
4480640	4481640	Or is it Bland?
4483640	4486640	And you're the fourth generation of Blands?
4488640	4489640	Holy shit, wow.
4489640	4491640	So that's ironic.
4491640	4492640	Hence the piercings.
4493640	4497640	It is powerful and flavorful that you're the fourth Bland.
4497640	4500640	And also that he chose extreme dill to put on his dick.
4501640	4503640	It's the pickle, you know.
4503640	4507640	Bland, do you only consume extreme flavors?
4508640	4509640	I try to.
4511640	4515640	Actually, this really made me burp a lot of dill flavor afterwards.
4515640	4516640	Oh, you ate them?
4516640	4517640	Yeah, I ate some of them.
4517640	4520640	Yeah, that's not a flavor I'd grab off the shelf or expect to ever find.
4520640	4522640	It's got a sour meter on it.
4523640	4525640	It's a super stack.
4526640	4528640	You can test your taste buds.
4529640	4531640	And it's a screaming dill pickle.
4531640	4532640	Extreme flavor.
4533640	4535640	I guess we got to do Pringles Dick song with Bland.
4536640	4537640	Do you know Pringles Dick?
4537640	4540640	I don't know all of it, but I know some of it.
4541640	4543640	Some people call me Pringles Dick,
4543640	4545640	but I never really found out why.
4547640	4549640	I don't really have a Pringles Dick,
4549640	4551640	I just keep my dick inside.
4553640	4555640	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can
4555640	4558640	because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
4559640	4561640	Some people call me Pringles Dick,
4561640	4563640	but I never really found out
4563640	4565640	No, I never found out
4565640	4567640	Never really found out why.
4567640	4568640	Bland.
4568640	4569640	Thank you, Bland.
4570640	4571640	Cheers, brother.
4574640	4575640	Bland.
4575640	4576640	Now we've got a little tie in the back.
4576640	4578640	That was some complicated shit.
4579640	4584640	It's weird that he put all the time into making the Pringles Dick thing,
4584640	4587640	ate the chip, doesn't really know the whole song.
4587640	4590640	How is that can staying in your pants, just by zipper force?
4590640	4591640	Yeah.
4591640	4592640	I don't know, why are you bewildered by that?
4592640	4594640	I'm just surprised it doesn't fall out.
4597640	4599640	Haven't you ever put something in your zipper
4599640	4600640	and pretended it was your dick?
4600640	4601640	My dick?
4602640	4603640	I guess the answer is no.
4605640	4608640	Alright Spencer, catch us up to date if you would.
4608640	4610640	Harry, you want to pass us down.
4610640	4612640	The characters here are being dispensed.
4612640	4617640	When we last met, our heroes came to in the belly of a mythical creature
4617640	4619640	known only as the Infinifish.
4619640	4623640	Our heroes were discovered by a group of seven humans and a halfling
4623640	4627640	that formed a tribe deep within the bowels of the great beast.
4627640	4630640	Meeting with Aaliyah, the leader of the fish dwellers,
4630640	4632640	the chieftain led the heroes to their village,
4632640	4636640	a safe haven nestled between the arterial landscape of the fishes and sides.
4636640	4639640	It was there that Mulrain and Sharpie, in a moment of tension and feelings,
4639640	4643640	had a deep but important conversation about their complicated relationship.
4643640	4646640	Afterwards, they headed to one of the villagers' stores
4646640	4650640	and bought some ropes, potions, and syringes full of paralyzing agents.
4650640	4653640	They didn't know how, but they knew they had to escape.
4655640	4656640	Go!
4656640	4657640	Spencer, everybody.
4662640	4664640	So if you recall, you're in this village.
4664640	4667640	It's been made out of things that the fish has eaten.
4667640	4669640	And yeah, you were talking to the chieftain.
4669640	4670640	Yeah.
4670640	4671640	You got some stuff.
4671640	4672640	All right.
4672640	4675640	So we were talking about making this fish barf us up,
4675640	4677640	you know, like Pinocchio style, right?
4677640	4678640	Yeah, there are two episodes behind.
4678640	4681640	We got swallowed by a big giant fish, and we're trying to make it barf.
4681640	4682640	Teleportation.
4682640	4683640	What about it?
4683640	4684640	Teleportation what?
4684640	4685640	Yeah, you have that cloak.
4685640	4686640	It teleports.
4686640	4687640	Jesus, I have a teleportation cloak.
4687640	4688640	Yeah.
4688640	4689640	Wow.
4689640	4690640	Can you teleport out to the blowhole?
4690640	4692640	Maybe it doesn't have a blowhole.
4692640	4693640	Maybe it's not a whale.
4693640	4694640	No, not a whale.
4694640	4695640	How does that cloak work?
4695640	4696640	You don't even know, man.
4696640	4700640	Your dad showed it to you, and you didn't seem to have a mastery of it.
4700640	4702640	All right.
4702640	4704640	Just go for it anyways.
4704640	4706640	Can I think about the top of this infinite fish?
4706640	4708640	Okay, you can think about the top of it.
4708640	4709640	That happens.
4709640	4710640	All right, think about it.
4710640	4711640	All right, you're thinking about it.
4711640	4712640	I use the cloak.
4712640	4715640	I whip it around me like Alice Falls.
4715640	4716640	You're right.
4716640	4718640	It makes a weird noise.
4718640	4720640	It looks like it's out of juice for the day.
4720640	4722640	You're out of juice for the day.
4722640	4723640	Kind of.
4723640	4724640	Dungeon snap.
4724640	4726640	If anyone wants to top me off.
4726640	4732640	All right, so we have to get this whale to expurge us somehow, right?
4732640	4734640	We want to get coughed up out of here.
4734640	4736640	Hey, give me some of those crystals.
4736640	4740640	Remember when we got first on board this infinite fish, and you had your healing crystals shattered,
4740640	4744640	and it had little crystals that were absorbed in your body you got back up to 40 hit points.
4744640	4746640	Do you have any of those extra crystals left?
4746640	4747640	I handed my crystals.
4747640	4748640	All right, you hand them your crystals.
4748640	4750640	Can I rub them on the cloak?
4750640	4751640	The rest of the cripple.
4751640	4754640	Is there a battery compartment?
4754640	4756640	Rubbing the crystals on the cloak.
4756640	4760640	They glow softly, but then grow inert.
4760640	4761640	All right, you can have them back.
4761640	4763640	They're dumb.
4763640	4766640	Several of the crystals dissolve, healing you to full health.
4766640	4767640	Oh, oops, sorry.
4767640	4770640	I accidentally healed myself.
4770640	4775640	These people, their dwellings are made out of wood.
4775640	4776640	Yep.
4777640	4782640	What if we asked them if we could set their homes on fire?
4782640	4784640	Go on.
4784640	4789640	And obviously take them with us, and maybe if we set their homes on fire,
4789640	4794640	the fish would spit us out, or just burn up, or we'd all die.
4794640	4798640	Do you want to consult, or do you just want to start setting fires?
4798640	4799640	No, no.
4799640	4802640	May I consult with the leader of the fish dwellers?
4802640	4804640	I am the leader of the fish dwellers.
4804640	4805640	Hey.
4805640	4808640	I heard you talking about things.
4808640	4809640	Yes.
4809640	4812640	First of all, I want to say that I greatly respect your architecture
4812640	4817640	and your house, and secondly, can we set it on fire?
4817640	4818640	We live here.
4818640	4819640	Is there any reason?
4819640	4820640	Do you just like it?
4820640	4821640	Are you a pyromaniac?
4821640	4823640	No, no, no.
4823640	4830640	I don't hate fire, but I, you know, you said that you've been here
4830640	4831640	for a long time.
4831640	4834640	I don't know how passionate you are about leaving, but we certainly are.
4834640	4839640	Maybe we can work together, set your home on fire, and we can all leave.
4839640	4842640	Maybe the fish will open its mouth.
4842640	4843640	We can all leave.
4843640	4844640	Also, you look great.
4844640	4845640	Thanks.
4845640	4846640	Thanks.
4846640	4850640	Well, you see, stories tell of my grandpappy.
4850640	4854640	The first three ships that sailed through here, we did indeed light on fire,
4854640	4858640	hoping that would work, but it seems the beast's insides are quite resistant to heat.
4858640	4859640	Oh, okay.
4859640	4861640	Jeff, do you have a little notepad?
4861640	4862640	Yeah.
4862640	4863640	Do you keep little D&D notes?
4863640	4864640	Sometimes.
4864640	4865640	Nice.
4865640	4866640	Yeah.
4866640	4867640	Yeah.
4867640	4871640	Someone's got to take this shit seriously, you guys.
4871640	4872640	What is that word on your paper?
4872640	4873640	What does that say?
4873640	4876640	It's Leah, the name of the leader of the fish people.
4876640	4877640	Shit.
4877640	4881640	I write down the names of the people that come up on stage so I can thank them later on.
4881640	4882640	Oh, geez.
4882640	4883640	You're very nice.
4883640	4884640	That's comfortable.
4884640	4887640	I draw little pictures of people.
4887640	4892640	I've got my famous buttermilk biscuit recipe down in here.
4893640	4895640	All right, so that was a good idea, Maureen.
4895640	4896640	I liked where you're going with that one.
4896640	4897640	It sounds like a no.
4897640	4899640	It sounds like it's not a good idea.
4899640	4900640	I'm glad I asked.
4900640	4904640	If you want to damage various parts of the fish's insides, that might work.
4904640	4909640	I say, let's go down and let's ... Shit.
4909640	4913640	I mean, I don't know if killing the fish is a great idea or hurting it.
4913640	4918640	It's like if this thing is floating through the air and then you've hurt it.
4918640	4920640	Do we know where the fish is?
4920640	4924640	Where they fit a fish's gag reflexes, where its uvula is?
4924640	4929640	You don't, but you have a feeling it might be somewhere along the digestive tract.
4929640	4930640	Weird.
4930640	4935640	I lead us off in the direction of the esophageal part of the fish.
4935640	4939640	Oh, Leah says, you can go fish west to its primary digestive tract.
4939640	4943640	You can go fish south, but no one ever goes fish south.
4943640	4944640	Why?
4944640	4945640	Why doesn't ...
4945640	4946640	Because you get pooped.
4947640	4948640	Let's go get pooped.
4948640	4949640	Well, don't ...
4949640	4950640	Yes.
4950640	4951640	Why don't we get pooped?
4951640	4954640	Because everyone who ever gone that way is dead.
4954640	4955640	Can he try it once?
4955640	4956640	Because they've never seen them again?
4956640	4957640	Yeah.
4957640	4958640	Can he try it once?
4958640	4959640	He never returned.
4959640	4960640	He never ...
4960640	4962640	Some say he escaped, but others say he perished.
4962640	4966640	And others maintain that he never existed.
4966640	4970640	So, I mean, either way.
4970640	4974640	So we can make him sneeze or gag, or we can punch a hole through him,
4974640	4976640	or we can go get pooped out the infinite fish.
4976640	4979640	But then we're going to be floating out in the sky, right?
4979640	4980640	Maybe.
4980640	4981640	Maybe not.
4981640	4982640	Okay.
4982640	4984640	And we don't want that.
4984640	4987640	So, hypothetically, we want a ship to fly inside the fish.
4987640	4990640	Then we get on the fish, on the ship.
4990640	4991640	You could.
4991640	4992640	You also have a broken ship.
4992640	4994640	You could repair it if you thought you wanted a ship.
4994640	4996640	Can I use portable hole?
4996640	4997640	To do what?
4997640	4999640	To fall through it?
4999640	5002640	It doesn't put a hole in a wall.
5002640	5004640	It just makes a pit appear.
5004640	5007640	So you'd get in the pit, and it wouldn't take you to the other side.
5007640	5008640	So it's more like a hiding spot.
5008640	5010640	Yeah, it's a hiding spot.
5010640	5012640	Are you able to pull those a hole?
5012640	5013640	I'm just curious.
5013640	5016640	When you go into them, are you able to pull them down into the ...
5016640	5017640	Like pull it into itself?
5017640	5018640	Yeah.
5018640	5021640	Like you'd probably turn inside out and explode or something.
5021640	5022640	I don't know.
5022640	5024640	I'm feeling lucky today.
5024640	5027640	I said we'd go try the poop shoot.
5027640	5030640	Yeah.
5030640	5034640	You see a purple pulsating sphincter to the south.
5034640	5038640	It seems tiny, but you might be able to squeeze through.
5038640	5040640	Can you say that 10 times fast?
5040640	5043640	No.
5043640	5048640	I'm a little ... I'll go first.
5048640	5049640	Wait.
5049640	5050640	Wait.
5050640	5051640	Stop.
5051640	5052640	Yeah?
5052640	5053640	I just want to Instagram this.
5053640	5054640	No, no.
5054640	5056640	I want to tie a rope around you.
5056640	5057640	Oh, great idea.
5057640	5058640	Yeah, thanks.
5058640	5059640	You bought rope, didn't you?
5059640	5060640	Yeah, I have rope.
5060640	5064640	I'll tie ... I'm tying rope around quirk's waist.
5064640	5066640	I'm tying that to my ...
5066640	5071640	Two tugs means I'm in an infinite toilet and I'm drowning.
5071640	5072640	Pull me back.
5072640	5074640	One tug means ...
5074640	5075640	Good to go.
5075640	5076640	Follow me.
5076640	5077640	Okay.
5077640	5083640	Yeah, and if you start tugging a lot of times, we'll start writing it down like it's a song.
5083640	5084640	Like Morse code?
5084640	5086640	Yeah, yeah, but a song, but a beat to a song.
5087640	5090640	Better eliminate one tug as an option because one tug could be a chaotic thing generated by all shapes.
5090640	5091640	Yeah, okay.
5091640	5094640	So, shave and a haircut, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
5094640	5097640	That means don't come in here.
5097640	5098640	Don't come in.
5098640	5099640	Yeah, don't come in.
5099640	5102640	But if I go duh, duh, that means you can come in.
5102640	5103640	That means ...
5103640	5106640	So if you get here, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.
5106640	5107640	Don't come in.
5107640	5108640	I don't think ...
5108640	5109640	That means ...
5109640	5110640	Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.
5110640	5111640	That means it's good to go.
5111640	5112640	Quirk, quirk.
5112640	5115640	So if you go through the anus and it's imminent danger, you're going to be like, all right,
5115640	5117640	meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.
5117640	5119640	Yeah, because that's the system.
5119640	5120640	Okay.
5120640	5121640	That's the system.
5121640	5122640	All right, okay.
5122640	5123640	Okay, all right.
5123640	5125640	So you think you'll have that presence of mind no matter what happens.
5125640	5126640	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5126640	5127640	Look, fuck it.
5127640	5128640	That's there.
5128640	5129640	Absolutely.
5129640	5130640	Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.
5130640	5131640	Don't come.
5131640	5132640	Don't come.
5132640	5133640	But come down.
5133640	5134640	Come down.
5134640	5135640	I am the toilet.
5135640	5136640	I am the toilet.
5136640	5137640	Calm down.
5137640	5138640	Calm down.
5138640	5139640	Okay.
5141640	5142640	Yeah.
5142640	5143640	Okay?
5143640	5144640	Right.
5144640	5154640	So I'm going to rope firmly around my midsection and squeeze through the purple pulsating anus.
5154640	5156640	Muscular action sucks you in.
5156640	5161640	You find yourself in a narrow red passageway.
5161640	5168640	It opens up to an outcropping that looks over a lake of acid on the far wall.
5168640	5170640	You can see a similar outcropping.
5170640	5171640	Am I safe where I'm standing?
5171640	5172640	You're safe where you're standing.
5172640	5174640	Yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.
5174640	5175640	Yank, yank.
5175640	5177640	So that means we don't go.
5177640	5178640	No, no.
5178640	5181640	Didn't you hear the last two yanks?
5181640	5182640	No.
5182640	5188640	I mean, that means he's probably perfectly safe not standing over an outcropping of acid.
5188640	5191640	So we'll keep our end of the bargain and follow him.
5191640	5192640	Okay.
5192640	5193640	Sharpie, really quick.
5193640	5201640	Before we go into the zenas, I just had to tell you that I, you know, last night was pretty heavy.
5201640	5204640	But I love you and I love you forever.
5204640	5206640	I don't care what happens.
5206640	5212640	I know.
5212640	5221640	I give her a passionate kiss or at least one that it's so that it's taken so long to do that it's passionate.
5221640	5223640	To the fans.
5223640	5225640	What part of yank, yank, yank, yank, yank.
5225640	5226640	Yank, yank.
5226640	5227640	Because you guys not understand.
5227640	5228640	All right.
5228640	5229640	Let's go.
5229640	5230640	All right.
5230640	5231640	I proceed.
5231640	5232640	All right.
5232640	5254640	On the far wall, you see a similar purple pulsating sphincter.
5254640	5257640	A few giant wasps flip around the room.
5257640	5258640	Wasps?
5258640	5259640	Yeah, giant ones.
5259640	5260640	All right.
5260640	5263640	Well, the biological analog is breaking down for me.
5263640	5265640	So there are two sphincters?
5265640	5266640	There's two, yeah.
5266640	5269640	We've ventured through one and there's another one along the other path.
5269640	5270640	I see.
5270640	5273640	So like, you know, we could be in a stomach kind of chamber.
5273640	5274640	And it's acid.
5274640	5275640	So I think we probably.
5275640	5283640	We feel like being finna fish being an infinitely big almost organism probably just has more like big lakes of acid that kind of break down things in different stages.
5283640	5285640	Yeah, we're in the stomach right now.
5285640	5287640	But if you could fly above it, you wouldn't dissolve.
5288640	5289640	Oh.
5289640	5290640	Yep.
5290640	5291640	I fly above it.
5291640	5293640	Well, I use my teleportation.
5293640	5294640	Oh, wait.
5294640	5295640	You said it's out of juice.
5295640	5296640	Yeah.
5296640	5297640	Can't you fly, Dan?
5297640	5298640	Didn't you have a fly thing?
5298640	5299640	Well, I have a feather fall.
5299640	5306640	If I start to fall, I could slowly lower myself into the acid.
5306640	5309640	I wouldn't like break my neck on impact or anything.
5309640	5315640	I take one of our mole rains arrows and tie the rope to it and say, shoot the arrow into the far wall.
5315640	5317640	We'll climb across it like a rope bridge style.
5317640	5318640	Oh, boy.
5318640	5319640	All right.
5319640	5321640	I shoot an arrow.
5321640	5322640	Okay.
5322640	5325640	You shoot an arrow and flies across the room.
5325640	5331640	But much like the cord of your microphone, which just fell on the floor, the rope disengages itself.
5331640	5333640	It doesn't cross the chasm.
5333640	5336640	I need to consult you about one of my spells.
5336640	5337640	Yeah.
5337640	5339640	Don't I have tensors floating disk?
5339640	5340640	Tensors floating disk.
5340640	5341640	Yes.
5341640	5343640	You know, does that have any range to it?
5343640	5345640	Can anyone get on that and I can send them across?
5345640	5346640	They can get on it.
5346640	5349640	But I feel like there's a weight limit.
5349640	5351640	I think it's like a hundred.
5351640	5353640	Excuse me.
5353640	5355640	Well, Sharpie is pretty small or a quark.
5355640	5356640	Yeah.
5356640	5357640	Okay.
5357640	5358640	I'll just you could probably send quark over.
5358640	5362640	You're not so sure whether you put me in a frisbee and throw me across the acid.
5362640	5363640	Yeah.
5363640	5364640	Exactly.
5364640	5365640	Yeah.
5365640	5366640	Yeah.
5366640	5367640	I have like a thing called tensors floating disk.
5367640	5372640	It's like a way to it's like a floating hover sled so I could put equipment on it.
5372640	5373640	Okay.
5373640	5377640	But Spencer, after I turn into a woman, I weigh like 50 pounds now, right?
5377640	5378640	Fifty?
5378640	5379640	I don't know.
5379640	5380640	It's a standard weight for a woman.
5380640	5381640	Dead.
5381640	5382640	Ladies?
5382640	5383640	I don't know.
5383640	5384640	Okay.
5384640	5385640	A hundred.
5385640	5386640	Just a hundred.
5386640	5390640	Did you have a sweet spell, man?
5390640	5391640	Yeah.
5391640	5392640	A reduced person.
5392640	5393640	Yeah.
5393640	5394640	A reduced one of us.
5394640	5395640	Oh, God.
5395640	5396640	Please don't reduce me.
5396640	5397640	Reduce mole rain and throw her across the acid.
5397640	5405160	If I reduce mole rain, will the weight limit of her, will she plus quark be under the weight
5405160	5406680	limit of tensors floating disk?
5406680	5408000	I'm just going to say yes.
5408000	5409000	Okay.
5409000	5410000	All right.
5410000	5412000	I cast reduced person on mole rain.
5412000	5413000	Typical.
5413000	5414000	Yeah.
5414000	5415400	Then I cast tensors floating disk.
5415400	5416400	Okay.
5416400	5418400	Put the two of them on the disk.
5418400	5419400	Yep.
5419400	5420400	Yep.
5420400	5421400	And oogie boogie.
5421400	5422400	All right.
5422400	5423400	Your maneuver works.
5423400	5424400	They're on the other side.
5424400	5425400	All right.
5425400	5426400	Oh.
5426400	5427400	See you later.
5428160	5429160	Yeah.
5429160	5431600	They applaud it for less in Brooklyn, you know.
5431600	5432600	Can I?
5432600	5434240	They applaud it like a three-point ray of frost attack.
5434240	5436720	Can we throw the disk back to him so he can get on it?
5436720	5437720	Yeah.
5437720	5439680	I throw the disk back to Sharpie.
5439680	5441760	There you go.
5441760	5444920	And I scream out, this is from both of us.
5444920	5448600	Well, I don't think I can get on my own floating disk.
5448600	5449600	Yeah.
5449600	5450600	Yeah.
5450600	5451600	You sound unsure.
5451600	5452600	I am kind of unsure.
5452600	5453600	I'm just rolling with it.
5453600	5454600	Ah, rolling with it.
5454600	5455600	All right.
5455800	5457400	I get on my own floating disk.
5457400	5458400	Woo.
5459240	5461840	Slowly, it hovers across.
5461840	5463880	You've piqued the attention of the flying wasps.
5463880	5464880	Oh, shit.
5464880	5465880	Oh.
5465880	5466880	Shit, man.
5472360	5473880	Are you using the dice the guy gave you?
5473880	5475120	Yeah, I am.
5475120	5478120	And it's not boating well.
5478120	5480280	Thanks, Bland.
5480280	5483640	Two of the wasps streak out of the air towards you,
5483640	5485440	pointing their vicious stings.
5485440	5487360	You manage to deflect one of the blows,
5487360	5490960	but it strikes you right in the shoulder.
5490960	5494680	You feel stinging pain as seven damage enters you.
5494680	5496640	But it enters your body.
5496640	5497800	Scorching ray.
5497800	5498800	Scorching ray.
5503200	5503960	It misses.
5507040	5508360	It flies into the wall.
5508360	5510680	Fire some arrows.
5510680	5512000	What should I fire them at?
5512000	5512800	The wasps.
5512800	5513320	Oh, the wasps.
5513320	5514800	Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.
5514800	5516160	You just made out with this guy,
5516160	5518240	and you just watched him getting his ass kicked, right?
5518240	5519160	I'm swooning.
5519160	5520000	I'm swooning.
5520000	5521960	You're standing up, and you're like, zing, zing, zing.
5521960	5522800	I'm swooning.
5522800	5524440	I'm swooning.
5524440	5528560	As a woman, I'm just thinking about babies and doilies.
5528560	5532680	I fired, OK, so it's just one wasp.
5532680	5536600	I fire one arrow.
5536600	5538040	Like a regular arrow?
5538040	5538880	A regular arrow.
5538880	5541760	But I'm really focusing, Spencer.
5541760	5543960	Yeah, you are.
5543960	5544640	You hit it.
5545640	5546760	Right in the wing.
5546760	5550280	The wing falls off of its body and careens
5550280	5553160	into the lake of acid.
5553160	5555800	Your ascent movement continues.
5555800	5559000	All right, tensor-ized.
5559000	5562040	You get to the far outcropping.
5562040	5563360	Tensor's disc, out.
5566720	5568840	The other wasp is droning lazily around.
5568840	5570680	He knows better than to mess with y'all.
5570680	5571280	OK, cool.
5571280	5572480	Let's not fuck with that guy.
5572480	5573000	No.
5573080	5575400	So what are we looking at now, Spencer?
5575400	5576360	Purple sphincter.
5576360	5578480	Purple sphincter.
5578480	5580440	Same system.
5580440	5582760	Although, can I recommend?
5582760	5585800	Can we talk about those shoes in a haircut?
5585800	5590800	Yeah, it just seems like, like, now let's use the same system.
5590800	5591400	I'm sorry.
5591400	5592000	OK.
5592000	5592760	But it's OK.
5592760	5596000	So if something's going wrong, then you say.
5596000	5598520	Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
5598520	5599720	OK, so that's bad.
5599720	5600520	So that's bad.
5600520	5601080	Yeah, right.
5601080	5601720	If there's no other checks.
5601720	5602880	That's what happened before.
5602880	5605960	I'm in a butthole.
5605960	5607040	Come in.
5607040	5608040	Come in.
5608040	5610840	If I have to, I'm in a butthole.
5610840	5612680	I'm in a butthole.
5612680	5614560	If I don't, if I don't say that, think of it this way.
5614560	5615080	OK.
5615080	5616840	Did you say two before I made it?
5616840	5617880	OK.
5617880	5621320	I'm in terrible danger.
5621320	5624040	Just kidding.
5624040	5625880	So the two tucks make sense to me.
5625880	5627200	That makes sense to me.
5627200	5628320	Oh, god.
5628320	5630480	Baby's so smart.
5630480	5633840	Baby's system's so good.
5633840	5635040	Is there something on my face?
5635040	5636560	No, I'm worried that there is mine.
5636560	5638200	I don't.
5638200	5639960	I've been conditioned before he got up here.
5639960	5641840	There was hair hanging everywhere.
5641840	5642480	All right.
5642480	5644400	And he does the hairs there.
5644400	5645760	I'm in terrible danger.
5645760	5646280	OK.
5646280	5646880	Just kidding.
5646880	5648880	I tie the rope around my waist and ease my way
5648880	5649880	through the other sphincter.
5649880	5651760	You climb into the sphincter and immediately
5651760	5654080	feel embraced by powerful muscular action.
5654080	5656880	Story of Jeff's life.
5656880	5658000	Yeah.
5658000	5658800	That's true.
5658800	5660800	Immediately, you feel the rope snap.
5660800	5663040	Your side, Sharpie and Moran, it goes slap.
5663040	5663880	Oh, no.
5663880	5664360	Oh, no.
5664360	5666040	You're being pushed through a fleshy opening
5666040	5668720	with insane speed.
5668720	5671320	You feel like you're falling and then being pulled upwards
5671320	5673600	and all around and suddenly you're falling again.
5673600	5674080	Oh, shit.
5674080	5675720	So we're not feeling any signals.
5675720	5676560	Is he fine?
5676560	5677760	No, you feel it go slap.
5677760	5678280	No, I know.
5678280	5679400	I'm just kidding.
5679400	5680080	Holy shit.
5680080	5681880	Wait, is the rope, I pull on the rope.
5681880	5683120	It comes out.
5683120	5683680	It's broken?
5683680	5684200	Yes.
5684200	5685400	OK.
5685400	5688360	I tie the rope to another arrow.
5689160	5693440	I fire the arrow right on the rim of the sphincter.
5693440	5696280	All right, you miss.
5696280	5698840	OK, you could just stab it in if you'd like.
5698840	5700120	Oh, OK, I stab it in.
5700120	5701320	That's fair, OK.
5701320	5704080	Also, gross.
5704080	5706520	Grosser than shooting it.
5706520	5707880	OK, so if I made a little stab, OK,
5707880	5710240	I thought I had to go across something.
5710240	5711600	Meanwhile, a little help.
5714880	5717160	My chicken noodle can't pop.
5717160	5720880	OK, I tie the rope to my foot.
5720880	5722560	I tie the rope to my foot.
5722560	5725400	I take out two arrows.
5725400	5727600	I am holding them in my hand.
5727600	5731280	And I say to Sharpie, hold on to the other side of the rope.
5731280	5731800	OK.
5731800	5732840	We'll do the same system.
5732840	5735320	I'm going to find Quark.
5735320	5736680	OK, it's going to snap.
5736680	5738120	The rope's going to snap.
5738120	5740200	No, but it won't because I have arrows with me.
5740200	5742240	He didn't have any arrows.
5742240	5743280	How are the arrows?
5743280	5743920	What do you mean?
5743920	5748160	Because maybe something stabbed the rope apart.
5748160	5751040	And they didn't have a, is this a bad idea?
5751040	5753080	We can switch.
5753080	5757440	This is going to get the same results here.
5757440	5759720	He's gone into the intestinal tract.
5762480	5767680	We need to just either follow him or forget we ever knew him.
5767680	5770320	Well, then let's follow him.
5770320	5772840	Let's double bind our feet, just to be interesting.
5772840	5774480	I have a potion of enlarged person.
5774480	5778920	I'm wondering if I drink it just as I go in.
5778920	5779440	Right.
5779440	5781400	Just give this thing the biggest duke.
5781400	5782640	You may enlarge the tunnel.
5782640	5786400	And if he's stuck, then he'll, yeah, that's a great idea.
5786400	5787160	I don't know.
5787160	5791480	It doesn't, it just seems like a random thing to do, but.
5791480	5792240	Don't be shy.
5792240	5793120	You're so smart.
5796600	5798840	I charge headlong into the sphincter
5798840	5801280	as I drink a potion of enlarged person.
5801280	5802160	All right.
5802160	5803880	Straight ends life.
5803880	5807040	You too get sucked into the sphincter.
5807040	5809920	You travel around in it.
5809920	5812560	As you get larger and larger, it doesn't
5812560	5816160	seem to affect the speed of the esophageal ascendance.
5816160	5818400	You too soon are falling.
5818400	5822800	You land on a fleshy outcropping on the side of a big red pit.
5822800	5825760	Below you, you could see the ship you crashed here on.
5825760	5826480	Am I there too?
5826480	5827960	You were there too.
5827960	5829760	What's up?
5829760	5831280	You've just been sitting there for a bit.
5831280	5831800	Yeah.
5832320	5835160	What were you guys doing, talking about how smart you were
5835160	5839560	and just fucking doing bullshit?
5839560	5841320	Before you get judgmental, you might
5841320	5843800	want to realize you're going to be around us for a while.
5843800	5845880	We just came full circle.
5845880	5848160	That's our ship down there.
5848160	5849920	Oh wait, so we just wasted a bunch of time?
5849920	5852240	On the small ledge is a small campfire,
5852240	5855400	as well as a green tent.
5855400	5857120	Which, who's on this ledge?
5857120	5858520	You guys are both on this ledge.
5858520	5859360	Oh, we're both on it?
5859360	5860880	We're on the other side of the sphincter.
5860880	5861240	Yeah.
5861280	5864720	Let's go up to the green tent.
5864720	5865880	All right, that happens.
5865880	5868360	I knock on the flap.
5868360	5870760	It doesn't sound like much, but you hear the rustling
5870760	5874720	and shaking of something exiting the tent.
5874720	5876240	What's he look like?
5876240	5879120	Out climbs a tall thin elf with long blonde hair.
5879120	5881240	He's wearing stained red leather clothes
5881240	5883720	and at his side is a magnificent long sword
5883720	5885360	with a pristine golden blade.
5885360	5887360	Sheesh.
5887360	5894800	Haldo, I am Prince Valicent of the Valicent Phyftum.
5894800	5895320	Hello.
5898120	5902560	What brings you to my outcropping?
5902560	5905240	Oh, we just went through some butts and.
5905240	5909280	We were trying to get pooped out of a fish.
5909280	5910280	Well, you were close.
5910280	5914920	You got pooped somewhere just to my little camp.
5914920	5915840	How's it going?
5916840	5918760	Do you want a sandwich?
5918760	5919800	What's it made of?
5919800	5923160	The fish innards.
5923160	5926200	Is there a way to get out of this fish?
5926200	5928000	I don't know much about navigation,
5928000	5930880	although what I do know is sword mastery.
5930880	5935000	I am a sword master and I master all swords.
5935000	5936560	Can't we just slice our way out of this thing?
5936560	5939000	Can't we just start slicing and dicing and punch a hole?
5939000	5940680	The thing about such great beasts
5940680	5943600	is although you can do hefty damage to their insides,
5943600	5945880	muscular action tends to close the wound,
5945880	5948280	sealing any path way out.
5948280	5950360	You'd have to do something pretty dangerous
5950360	5953240	to some of the vital organs to knock this thing out of the air.
5953240	5957560	Meanwhile, I jump into this finger to join them.
5957560	5959160	But if we knock this thing out of the air,
5959160	5960520	don't we all die anyway?
5960520	5961240	Maybe.
5961240	5962760	I mean, that's all up to you.
5962760	5966440	What if it like vomits you into like a cushion plane,
5966440	5968160	a plane of eternal cushioning?
5968160	5970880	So we have to go get to a heart or a lung or something
5970880	5972800	like that and go stab it in the heart?
5972800	5976960	I'm not much of an infinifish biologist by any means,
5976960	5978360	but we're more of a swordsman.
5978360	5978880	Yeah.
5978880	5980320	What are you good at?
5980320	5981400	I'm good at swords.
5981400	5984800	Like, OK, OK, check this out.
5984800	5986240	Shoot an arrow.
5986240	5988320	All right, I shoot one arrow.
5988320	5991720	OK, you shoot it over the side of the pit.
5991720	5995160	As it descends towards the earth, he unsheathes the sword
5995160	5998920	and in a single fluid motion strikes with his blade.
5998920	6000480	Although he's a good 30 feet off,
6000480	6003080	you could see the arrow break into half and fall into pieces.
6003080	6005200	Like Robin Hood men in tights?
6005200	6008720	Does he have like magic far sword powers?
6008720	6010200	He's just fast with knives.
6010200	6011120	It's a Mel Brooks, maybe.
6011120	6012720	It's just not realistic.
6012720	6015600	All right, so we need to take this guy on a journey
6015600	6017120	after the organs and use his sword
6017120	6019040	to destroy the heart of this thing probably, right?
6019040	6020360	Yeah, he's got far sword abilities.
6020360	6023720	Yeah, I don't have a problem with you guys escaping,
6023720	6025520	but I kind of dig it.
6025520	6028120	The Valicent Kingdom was pretty shitty.
6028120	6029520	Wait, what are you talking about?
6029640	6031160	You like it inside a fish?
6031160	6035320	Yeah, it's like there's sandwiches.
6035320	6037280	Well, if you come with us, you'll
6037280	6041720	have sandwiches that aren't made of fish innards.
6041720	6045160	Like what else do you put in a sandwich?
6045160	6047520	How long have you been here?
6047520	6049880	I mean, we just ate fish sandwiches, too.
6049880	6051280	That was typical.
6051280	6052480	There's a whole world out there.
6052480	6054480	Maybe we can show you some affection.
6054480	6055120	No.
6055120	6056880	Yeah, my girlfriend will fuck you, I guess,
6056880	6057720	is what she's saying.
6057720	6061160	I don't know why she's saying that.
6061160	6063960	Oh, she'll fuck you.
6063960	6066360	And I mean, fuck you.
6066360	6068800	You're going to have a pussy sandwich.
6068800	6071120	Believe me, I have my share of portable holes.
6076280	6081240	Which portable holes had never existed in this universe?
6081240	6083080	I can make mine pretty stationary.
6083080	6084760	Well, I guess the conversation's moot,
6084760	6087600	because you said you'd like to help us, but you want to stay.
6088120	6090520	Maybe you could just show us away and then go back.
6090520	6092080	Is there anything that we could offer you
6092080	6095920	that you value that we might be able to bribe you with?
6095920	6098400	Do you have any weapons?
6098400	6102160	I have a couple swords.
6102160	6103040	Yeah.
6103040	6104520	I have an emerald dagger.
6104520	6105000	Yeah.
6105000	6109080	I have a sense of adventure.
6109080	6111800	Wait, didn't you say you'd be happy to help us?
6111800	6115120	I'd be happy to help you with any sword-related problems
6115120	6116840	or sword-related expertise.
6116920	6118080	I have a great flaming sword.
6118080	6118920	It's pretty cool.
6118920	6119560	Do you know?
6119560	6120720	You don't have to give him anything.
6120720	6121600	He's going to help us anyway.
6121600	6122080	Is he is?
6122080	6122560	Yeah.
6122560	6123200	He likes helping us.
6123200	6125120	Hey, come with us, and we'll just talk swords.
6125120	6128040	Oh, you and I, we'll talk swords all day long.
6128040	6130120	We'll play sword fight.
6130120	6134240	Dave, you guys, have you heard the new broadsword monthly?
6134240	6135280	Hell yeah.
6135280	6136200	I wrote a piece for it.
6136200	6140480	I can't believe it gets delivered here, of all places.
6140480	6142680	But yeah, I mean, you seem pretty cool.
6142680	6143200	Let's talk.
6143200	6143880	Let's go.
6143880	6144480	All right.
6144480	6145280	How do I get down?
6147440	6148800	You've got to get up, Featherfall.
6151400	6151880	All right.
6151880	6153040	Can I cast that on other people?
6153040	6155240	Sounds good, yeah.
6155240	6156400	Yep.
6156400	6157720	I can cast that on other people?
6157720	6159480	Yeah, you can cast it on people.
6159480	6161560	All right, I cast Featherfall on everybody.
6161560	6162920	On everybody.
6162920	6164720	That's going to take up most of your spells.
6164720	6166560	You're going to need some rest after this,
6166560	6169360	but you gently float to the pit, the bottom of it.
6169360	6170320	You're back where you started.
6170320	6171240	Back where we started.
6171240	6172120	What a great adventure.
6172120	6173000	Back where we started.
6173000	6173480	Cliffhanger.
6173520	6175520	Yeah.
6175520	6179680	Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh,
6179680	6182960	eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, back where you started.
6182960	6184040	Thank you, Aaron McGathey.
6191040	6192320	We're not where we started, because now we
6192320	6194120	got a guy with super far sword powers,
6194120	6195480	and he's going to help us kick ass.
6195480	6195800	No, I know.
6195800	6197320	That's the point of his story, Jeff.
6197320	6199240	You go on little cycles.
6199240	6199840	Yeah?
6199840	6201280	Yeah.
6201280	6203960	I wasn't being derogatory when I said back where we started.
6203960	6205160	Oh, good.
6205160	6207720	Now, where do you feel like you started the show,
6207720	6209240	speaking of cycles, wondering where
6209240	6211680	we were in the Joseph Kim belly and thing?
6211680	6213280	It seems like tonight was pretty easy.
6213280	6214280	It was very supportive.
6214280	6214960	Maybe too easy.
6214960	6217320	Too easy for $20, right?
6217320	6218880	Some people are like, I drove six hours.
6218880	6220400	Why was it for $20?
6220400	6221400	Why is it so easy?
6221400	6223160	Do you feel like the audience needs you to work a little
6223160	6224280	harder, break a sweat up here?
6224280	6228680	No, I think the audience needs to give me validation
6228680	6231880	so that I can know that I gave them their $20 worth.
6231880	6234560	Well, they already gave you $20, though.
6234560	6237400	They gave the club $20, but I'm saying,
6237400	6238400	I don't want to cheat them.
6238400	6241040	I don't want them to call the Better Business Bureau.
6241040	6244560	I want to buck some mamas.
6244560	6245640	Oh, fuck some mamas.
6245640	6246440	Oh, OK.
6246440	6248680	I think they're saying that if I do some rapping,
6248680	6251200	if I do some freestyle rapping, then I'll
6251200	6253000	make their ticket price worthwhile.
6253000	6253520	All right.
6253520	6254920	Do you want to do the grand finale rap,
6254920	6257240	or do you want to do one of the freestyle styles?
6257240	6258880	I don't know.
6258880	6261000	Do we have any Rihanna's in the audience?
6261000	6263560	Any ditos?
6263560	6265480	Any girls that can come up and sing the Pia's
6265480	6267520	Yellow Pupa's Brown Hook to our thing?
6267520	6269480	At the very least, we have Ruth, right?
6269480	6270320	Not at the very least.
6270320	6271120	I didn't mean that.
6271120	6273320	How about, yeah, let's just re-invite Ruth to the stage.
6273320	6274320	Ruth, would you mind?
6274320	6274820	Whoo!
6281800	6283760	The phrase, at the very least, was not appropriate.
6283760	6286200	I just meant, because you already, we need it.
6286200	6288040	I have no idea what y'all are talking about.
6288040	6288960	Oh, OK.
6288960	6289960	Well, it's very easy.
6289960	6290920	All right, let's hear it.
6294920	6295800	There's a refrain.
6295800	6300120	OK, so I do terrible, awesome freestyle rapping.
6300120	6304360	And then there's a chorus that's like sort of a,
6304360	6308920	it's just you singing like the lyrics are.
6308920	6314880	Come on down to Harbin Town, turn that frown upside down.
6314880	6320600	Pia's yellow, Pupa's brown, come on down to Harbin Town.
6320600	6323440	Yo, trial run with a first verse.
6323440	6326560	Could be better, motherfucker, could be worse.
6326560	6329480	Put some chicken on my dick and some Pringles inside.
6329480	6332840	Fuck your mama till I saw she was twice as wide.
6332840	6336280	I've said the same words before, and you rhyme the same words
6336280	6337760	that you did before.
6337760	6340000	Before, rhymes with before.
6340000	6340840	It doesn't matter.
6340840	6343680	It's a first verse, and it doesn't matter.
6344680	6350160	Come on down to Harbin Town, turn that frown upside down.
6350160	6350960	We all forgot it.
6350960	6356480	Pia's yellow, Pupa's brown, come on down to Harbin Town.
6356480	6360040	Indiana, where the rivers flow, I fucked your mama so hard
6360040	6361520	she didn't know where to go.
6361520	6365240	I made her internal compass and her inner ear spin around
6365240	6368240	till she was like a bird that had experienced so much fear
6368240	6372480	that it didn't know how to live and eaten so many worms
6372560	6375320	that its stomach started to give and the bird exploded
6375320	6379840	and rain got down and your mama's so fuckable.
6379840	6381080	I can't believe it.
6381080	6386360	Come on down to Harbin Town, turn that frown upside down.
6386360	6392360	It's better, Pia's yellow, Pupa's brown, come on down to Harbin Town.
6392360	6394320	What's your name, Kyle?
6394320	6398480	Yeah, I like to fuck his mama for a while.
6398480	6401320	Your name, sir, it is Colin.
6401320	6404280	I fucked your mama so hard she started falling.
6404280	6406920	I fucked Kyle's mama, then I fucked Colin's.
6406920	6408560	I fucked up Mother Promise.
6408560	6411040	Whatever, I think that wasn't going to go.
6411040	6413480	It doesn't make any sense that I would do that.
6413480	6415440	This cord will only reach so far.
6415440	6422280	Yo, come on down to Harbin Town, turn that frown upside down.
6422280	6428440	Vicinity, Pia's yellow, Pupa's brown, come on down to Harbin Town.
6428440	6429920	What's your name, Ryan?
6429920	6435720	It is the man who fucked his mama hard like she needed an oil can.
6435720	6437120	He's the only one I can reach.
6437120	6438120	What's your name again?
6438120	6439120	Ryan.
6439120	6441120	That's what I thought.
6441120	6446280	I'm trying to work the crowd and rap at the same time and it's harder than I thought it
6446280	6447280	would be.
6447280	6449400	This cord don't reach.
6449400	6450400	What's your name?
6450400	6451400	Ryan.
6451400	6458680	Just rapping, working the crowd at the end of the cord.
6458680	6459680	What's your name?
6459680	6460680	Brad.
6460680	6461680	Brad does it.
6461680	6464680	Fucked his mama in all of her closets.
6464680	6465680	What's your name?
6465680	6466680	David.
6466680	6467680	David.
6467680	6468680	No, it's not.
6468680	6469680	Fucked your mama.
6469680	6473320	But on second thought, David's mama came to my house just the other day.
6473320	6476400	Fucked her on the scale, said, bitch, now you pay what you weigh.
6476400	6480440	I fucked her far hundred times, I fucked her so hard.
6480440	6488360	She had little crimes of residue from me, I'm sorry, turn that frown upside down.
6488360	6489360	That was gross.
6490360	6491360	It happens.
6493360	6495360	And your name is Eric.
6495360	6498360	Yeah, and you do what for a living?
6498360	6499360	Cell cell phone.
6499360	6500360	Yeah.
6501360	6503360	That's the truth.
6503360	6506360	That's the stone cold truth.
6506360	6511360	Eric's cell cell phones were verisin' but I fucked your mama so hard she started to
6511360	6517360	get surprised and results from my knob and my balls and I fucked her up to Canada.
6517360	6523360	I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama, I fucked your mama, I fucked
6523360	6524360	your mama.
6524360	6525360	I'm so sorry.
6530360	6531360	Microphone.
6533360	6534360	Strength.
6536360	6539360	Ruthie's up on the mic singing songs.
6539360	6542360	I fucked your mama so hard I didn't do it too long.
6542360	6545360	I only had to do it shortly because I did it hard.
6545360	6548360	I fucked your mama like my penis was a little sharp.
6548360	6551360	There's only so many words that rhyme with so many words.
6551360	6554360	I keep rhyming the same words with the same words.
6554360	6557360	We gotta think of new stuff or I gotta stop rapping.
6557360	6561360	You requested it but it's really starting to be crappin' out.
6561360	6563360	I'm sorry, Indiana.
6563360	6566360	I fucked your mama like her name was Brianna.
6567360	6570360	And it might as well have been because who cares what her name was.
6570360	6573360	Why do you fuck someone like their name was something?
6573360	6574360	That's a stupid idea.
6574360	6577360	It's a great state and you deserve much better.
6578360	6581360	I fucked Indiana's mama the other day.
6583360	6584360	Blah blah blah, something gay.
6585360	6586360	Dedede, doo doo doo.
6587360	6589360	I fucked your mama at the end of the night, something about a shoe.
6590360	6592360	Put your hat on your dick and your balls and butt.
6593360	6595360	I fucked your mama like she had a pussy and a butt.
6596360	6598360	I fucked your mama in her nuts and her balls.
6598360	6601360	I fucked her titties and the barrel and her balls.
6602360	6607360	I fucked your mama in the north and the south and the face and the nose and the butt and the mouth.
6608360	6610360	I fucked your mama like she was a pussy.
6610360	6613360	I fucked her on VH1 with Gary Busey.
6614360	6616360	I fucked your mama on the carpet and the rug.
6617360	6619360	I fucked your mama like my dick was a bug.
6620360	6621360	That's a new one.
6622360	6624360	So you can do it then. You're learning.
6625360	6626360	He's teasing himself.
6626360	6628360	I fucked your mama like my dick was a bug.
6628360	6630360	I put it deep inside her.
6630360	6631360	In her pussy rug.
6631360	6632360	Wait, I'm sorry, that was the other way around.
6632360	6633360	It's alright.
6633360	6634360	It's alright. It's alright. It's starting over.
6634360	6635360	It's starting over.
6638360	6640360	I fucked your mama like her pussy was a rug.
6641360	6643360	I put it in her like my dick was a bug.
6643360	6646360	It went underneath the carpet, came out in the kitchen.
6646360	6648360	Made itself a milkshake, said,
6648360	6652360	Woman quit your bitch and got 16 hours I've been working today.
6652360	6655360	I don't need to come home to hear the shit any other way.
6655360	6659360	I want to watch Duke's a hazard and have a sandwich.
6659360	6662360	I'll fuck a sandwich.
6664360	6666360	Thanks for coming to Harmon Town, everybody.

6670360	6671360	Thank you, Indiana.
6671360	6673360	You've been fun and forgiving.

6685360	6688360	Who is the one that brought us the great cookies and booze backstage?
6688360	6689360	Who is that?
6690360	6691360	Thank you.
6691360	6692360	We'll talk to you afterwards.
6692360	6693360	Thank you for that.
6693360	6694360	Matt, the Gary Beasley guy,
6694360	6696360	Caiman, the guy in the row,
6696360	6699360	Bland, the guy with the Pringles and the chicken soup
6699360	6700360	and everybody else.
6700360	6701360	We love you.
6701360	6702360	One more time. I'm Jeff Davis.
6702360	6703360	Caiman.
6703360	6705360	Your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
6709360	6710360	Come see all the other acts.
6710360	6712360	Check out the other acts here and stuff.
6712360	6713360	They have cool people, it looks like.
6713360	6715360	Yeah, we're looking around on the wall
6715360	6717360	and we're seeing all of our groovy friends from back home.
6717360	6719360	So obviously Jared and the guys here and the gals here
6719360	6720360	know what they're doing.
6720360	6721360	This is an awesome place.
6721360	6722360	Thank you so much for coming out.
6722360	6723360	Thank you.
6742360	6743360	All right.
6751360	6752360	Bonus track.
6753360	6754360	Bonus track.
6754360	6755360	Oh, shit.
6755360	6757360	No one will hear this on iTunes.
6757360	6759360	What's up with black people?
6762360	6763360	They're at it again.
6766360	6768360	I've had it up to here.
6769360	6771360	How much blacker are they going to get?
6773360	6775360	It's gotten out of control.
6778360	6779360	I...
6779360	6781360	It seems every day I open the newspaper.
6781360	6783360	Okay, now. Okay, great.
6784360	6785360	And I've had it.
6791360	6792360	Black people.
6794360	6795360	Urban.
6797360	6798360	Magic.
6799360	6802360	Black people are magical creatures
6802360	6805360	having all kinds of magical features.
6805360	6808360	They could shrink down to the size of a bug
6808360	6810360	and expand to the size of a boat
6810360	6812360	that you'd call a tugboat.
6813360	6816360	It's not that big, but it's not a small vehicle.
6816360	6818360	It's just a small ship.
6818360	6820360	It's aquatic in nature.
6820360	6823360	I fucked your mama so hard I could've sworn...
6823360	6824360	Ah, shit.
6824360	6825360	It's a bonus track.
6825360	6826360	Bonus track.
6826360	6827360	What do you want?
6827360	6829360	Did you think it was going to be a criterion?
6831360	6833360	It's just a little racism and a shitty rap.
6833360	6835360	That's what you get on your bonus track.
6839360	6841360	Alright, bonus, bonus track.
6841360	6843360	Alright, this is a deep bonus track.
